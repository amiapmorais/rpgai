[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Commitment Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Travis: [singing] The boys are back in town!
Justin: As if we’d ever left.
Griffin: Hi everybody, welcome back to The Adventure Zone! We’re happy to be here, we hope you are too. We’re about to start our first sort of experimental game, as we are between seasons where we’re all going to be taking turns running stuff and playing different games and trying out new genres. And this time, the person who’s going to be in charge is… Dad McElroy!
Clint:: Yay!
Justin: I wanted to talk briefly about how we came to this. Because in a lot of games— say Tag.
Travis: Uh huh.
Justin: The person who is the best at Tag gets to be the new tagger.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: And I’m curious as to what metric we dec— what is— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Well, Justin—
Justin: What was it in Dad’s mastery of— [Everybody laughs]
Justin: —Dungeons & Dragons that led us to think “I’ll tell you what this man needs; he needs a new— he needs to move onto a new game because he’s mastered this one” and let him lead— sort of lead the thing.
Travis: From my point of view Justin, I think it was Dad’s turn because out of all of us, he was the only one who was ready to go. So… by default...
Justin: You can also make the argument that by knowing too many of the rules of Dungeons & Dragons, you may be too deep— it may be harder for you to fluidly—
Griffin: [knowingly] Oh. That’s it!
Clint:: So by being really bad at Dungeons & Dragons, therefore—
Travis: [crosstalk] Because he only lightly settles on the lily pad, he’s able to jump to the next one so much easier!
Justin: Right. [Travis laughs]
Griffin: Daddy has what I like to call an empty old brain. And that’s— that’s bad for most things, but for this specific instance it’s good because you can fill it up with more game rules!
Travis: It’s a good brain.
Griffin: Um—
Justin: Within the first three weeks of us deciding to go this route, Dad was telling us “There’s a few of the rules I’m going to tweak” and I’m like “Oh really, Skrillex? You’re gonna fucking step in and remix this game system?” rather than— [Griffin, Travis and Clint laugh]
Clint:: I don’t know if it’s “tweak” as much as “not know”.
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: There we go.
Griffin: Big thanks to— uh— Travis and Justin: Evil Hat?
Clint:: Evil Hat. Yeah.
Griffin: —Evil Hat. We had somebody run us through a trial game of this last week and it was very— it was actually— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Thank you Morgan.
Griffin: Yeah, thank you Morgan. It was very helpful in sort of helping us understand how the game is supposed to operate. It was very informative, and I think our first proper episode is going to benefit from that. But that’s not this. This is sort of just our episode where we’re going to talk about the game and the world and what Dad has prepped. And we’re going to talk about our characters, so that when we do actually start playing we can just kinda step right into it. Um—
Travis: Well, first— just to start off, I don’t think we’ve said— we’re playing the Fate Core system.
Griffin: Yeah, I was hoping Dad could like start out with just sort of like a surface-level discussion of um— what it is we’re going to be playing, and why it is that he chose this system, and like what his sort of ambitions are for this little mini-arc? Again, this is— these are all going to be pretty short experimental things, probably two or three episodes, so… Dad, what’s up?
Clint:: Well, I uh— I got a lot of feedback from a lot of folks on social media and actual letters, believe it or not, um, and—
Travis: I don’t. But go on.
Clint:: —a lot of folks said that if you’re looking to do a superhero game, that this would really lend itself to that. But the most compelling thing to me was in the stuff I was reading and the stuff I was looking at, it looked like the Fate system is— relies much more heavily on collaboration and really emphasizes the dramatic angle. Almost a theatrical presentation of the action.
Um— when it comes to creating characters, you do it together. Uh, there’s a lot of back-and-forth and a lot of fluidity, a lot of flexibility involved in it. And it just seemed that a lot of the things that we have done up to this point really leans towards the storytelling, the dramatic, and uh— it just really appealed to me for that reason.
Travis: Also, I would say— to that point— one of the things as we’ve been playing around with it and testing it out, one of the things I think— uh, you mentioned flexibility, there’s a certain elasticity to the rules of Fate that’s like— you know how sometimes you have that house rule of like “If it’s a cool thing, you’re allowed to do it”?
Griffin: Yeah, exactly.
Travis: That’s basically one of the core ideas of the Fate system. Um, there are these things called aspects, that basically— they are character traits or traits of the situation or an item. So for example, you might have a character who is— Will Of Iron. Right? They have a will of iron, and so maybe they’re trying to cast a spell and there’s something that would be distracting them from that spell. You can invoke the aspect Will Of Iron to add like a +2 to your roll.
Griffin: Yeah, and what’s— where that system— it’s really important if you’ve never played Fate and we are not going to overburden you with like a— a— a— you know, comprehensive explanation, but it’s important for you to understand aspects because there’s other cool stuff that can happen where anything can have an aspect that will either benefit you or harm you in the future.
So that if there’s a big uh— you know, a big piece of electrical machinery in the room, one of the players can use their actions to try to uh— you know, create an advantage for everyone else, maybe by uh— you know, disabling that piece of machinery or by like punching it a whole lot. And then maybe it has the aspect like— Unstable. And then, when it’s your turn, you can invoke that aspect to gain a bonus or create some sort of opportunity or create some sort of action.
Anything, not just your characters, can have aspects. Aspects also come in the form of like injuries to your character. There are things called consequences, where if you take too much damage you have a consequence, and that’s an aspect that Dad can use against us. Like ‘Oh, well, because you have, you know, a broken rib— that’s one of your consequence aspects— I’m going to invoke that to, you know, do something bad to you.’ Uh, it’s a really, really, really cool flexible system.
Clint:: And also a lot of the— a lot of the action comes from skills. There are a number of fairly basic skills that you apply, so when you do have a confrontation, if you are more skilled at athletics or more skilled at uh— you know, more skilled in physique, it influences the roll. The rolls are really kinda cool in Fate. It’s fairly simple: you have these die and you roll ‘em.
They either have a plus, a minus or a blank side on the die, and when you roll the die— if the minuses cancel out the plusses, you accumulate those numbers and that’s your base for any kind of confrontation or something you have to overcome. Your skill points are added to that if it’s applicable. And then you also have stunts, which in our case will be superpowers since we’re going to do a— aah, a super-being, a superperson, uh, storyline.
Travis: Enhanced individual!
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint:: Enhanced individual.
Griffin: Yeah, so that’s very D&D-like. Right? Like that is the main point of familiarity. We are still rolling dice to try to beat either sort of static numbers that Dad has in mind for different situations or traps, or if we are combatting somebody, then Dad will roll and we will have sort of a skill contest. And we want to roll high and we want to add our skills to it, and then if that number doesn’t get us there, then maybe we invoke an aspect like we mentioned earlier to try and get us there.
Um, there’s also a really cool system— so usually if you want to do that, right— usually if you want to add an aspect to your roll, you have to spend what’s called a fate point, which we all have limited numbers of. Uh, and if you run out of those you’re going to be in trouble, right? Because those give you more flexibility in certain situations. But you can get them back with something that are called compels. And that basically means like “I am going to use an aspect against you— or against myself— to create a bad scenario for myself, but in doing that I will get a fate point back”. And that’s really the only way to get fate points.
And what’s neat about that is that we can suggest them for each other, Dad can suggest them for us, we can suggest them for ourselves, like “Oh, well I have the Clumsy aspect, so what if as a compel like I... trip and fall off the roof?”. “Ok well, you did that, and because you agreed to do this bad thing, now you have a fate point that you can use later on to— you know— benefit yourself later.”
Travis: So that’s the thing, is— what I really love about this system is the aspects and the— uh, like— there’s like troubles that you have, and the consequences— all of this stuff is both a mechanic and a character-building exercise.
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: ‘Cause like— if you think about in The Adventure Zone: Balance, there were things about our characters that we established, right? That it’s like, you know— “Magnus rushes in.” But if we’d been playing in the Fate system, the rushing in would have been an aspect that, like, I could invoke in battle—
Griffin: Sure. Rustic Hospitality would be an aspect, and then if you’re talking to somebody instead of just saying like “Well, I’m rustically hospitable so I think that they’re nicer to me”, you invoke that. You use that aspect, and maybe if you’re doing a rapport roll, is what they call like one of the main social skills. Uh, and it doesn’t entirely go your way. You say “Well, I am rustically hospitable. So I’m going to invoke that, have some sort of narrative explanation why it is applicable here and then I will get the bonus from it.”
So if you take away one thing from this, we are going to be throwing aspects around a lot. And they are statements about our characters or about uh, the scenario itself that we are going to be trying to use to our advantage, or invoking as a disadvantage when it is like narratively interesting, and we’ll get benefits from that also. That’s it.
Justin: We don’t want to overburden you with rules, and I know that probably— if you’re anything like most humans— hearing a bunch of rules told to you is not very effective. We just want to kind of like lay a groundwork. Because I think as we start playing— it’s not a— it’s a very intuitive system, I would say? And I think as we start playing, the important parts of this system are going to become obvious.
There are of course, if you’re interested, plenty of great— like, super quick tutorials on YouTube or elsewhere if you just want to like get the basics to get a little bit more out of it. But, as much as we told people who didn’t have any familiarity with D&D, I think you’re going to be able to enjoy this without understanding the system particularly well.
Clint:: And you the listener will get the enjoyment as you did from— from Balance— of listening to a bunch of people who don’t know how to play the game trying to play the game. So that’s cool.
Griffin: [crosstalk] And that’s—
Justin: And hey, [crosstalk] if you are an expert in it, um, all of our sort of social media handles and addresses are public—
Griffin: [sarcastically] Oh, great.
Justin: —so if you are an expert in it and we screw something up, keep it to/ yourself. And pipe down.
'Clint: laughs]
Griffin: Um, we should— joking aside, because I think this is really important for people to understand, um, because this is going to be across the board for all of these experiments. It’s going to be like— it’s going to be a little messy. Like there’s— we are not going to have a— a— a complete understanding, and I’m saying that kind of facetiously, of how this game works, and how to best play it, and how to make the best stuff with it, just because by virtue of the fact that we’re new to this and we’re only going to be playing this for a few episodes before we move on to another thing.
Same goes for like the world itself and the characters themselves. We are working really hard to make a cool cast of characters that are going to feel very rich, but we’re not going to have that like deep lore that comes from 80 hours of us playing together and fleshing this stuff out together. So like— I would only ask, and I’m not saying like ‘Don’t criticize— this makes us immune to criticism’ but treat this— the way we’re treating this is as— as an experiment, and it is, as— by virtue of that, it is not going to be this like hugely fleshed out thing that Balance was by the end of it. And that’s just not— that’s impossible, that’s just not going to happen. So um, I would ask you all to just sort of focus on what works and what doesn’t work, and then we will incorporate that into whatever it is we do next.
Travis: So, Dad, tell us about the world you have created in The Adventure Zone, colon, Commitment.
Clint:: Uh, the colon is very important.
Travis: Yes, tell us about colon commitment.
Justin: It’s, as far as I can tell—
Clint:: [crosstalk] Good colon health is vital.
Griffin: It absorbs all the fluid from your dookie is, I think, and that’s where it turns, like, you know, brown and stinky.
Travis: Whoa, whoa, slow down, Bill Nye the Science Guy!
Justin: That’s like 3rd arc shit you’re getting into right there. You gotta pace yourself.
Clint:: Yeah, hold off on that. Okay, the basic concept is— I would call it a comic book premise in the sense that it’s...contemporary, sorta like Marvel comics or DC comics are contemporary, ‘kay? Maybe a slight variation on reality but close enough that the decisions you guys make and the choices you make are kind of rooted in what’s— you know, what’s going on in the real world.
Griffin: Is it— is it— are we calling it 2017? Like, is it— is it like mo— current— current day, or—?
Clint:: I would say, yeah, I would say.
Travis: Is it that kind of bullshit thing where it’s like “present day” and then forty years from now and it still says “present day” and people are like, ‘That’s not present day,’ or is it 2017?
Clint:: Nah, no, it’s present day.
Travis: Oh, no! Okay.
Clint:: So here’s the basic premise. You guys are brand new recruits to an organization called the Do-Good Fellowship. And its name is pretty obvious. This is an organization that is dedicated to doing good stuff all across the globe. If there’s somebody in trouble, if there’s something that’s— that’s wrong, uh, they aren’t a police force or anything like that, they are there to— to help people in case of a major disaster or— or a— things along that line, and they are basically—
Griffin: Sort of like a humanitarian— a humanitarian organization?
Clint:: Yeah, like a humanitarian organization, yeah. Without any real specific ties to government or business. It’s actually based on a concept that Ben Franklin created—
Travis: [crosstalk] Wait who?
Clint:: And that was called a Junto. Ben Franklin, the first president of the United States—
Griffin: [crosstalk] The first president — ah damn it, he beat me to it!
Justin: [laughing]
Clint:: The— the Junto was 24 people who got together on a regular basis and met, and they were just— they weren’t special, they weren’t the richest, they weren’t the most powerful, it was just 12 people— I’m sorry, 12 people, that got together, and started off every meeting by answering 24 questions.
And I’m going to send you guys the 24 questions before we actually get started. But they were all about things like, “Did you see injustice today?” , “Did you get treated poorly today?” and these 24 questions, they were basically to have ideas to try to do what’s best for society, and that’s what the Do-Good Fellowship is kind of a spin-off from.
Griffin: So this is not— so this is not necessarily a military Junto, which is like—
Clint:: [crosstalk] No.
Griffin: —a completely different thing and— okay, I wanted to make that clear.
Clint:: No, Franklin called it a Junto.
Griffin: Junto.
Clint:: Yeah, which is a word he actually made up because the proper form is Junta, and this is not a Junta.
Justin: Hey listen, he had a grand slam with ‘news’ and he got a little cocky—
Clint:: He thought that was pretty cool—
Justin: And he thought he could just start coming up with whatever words he wanted.
Travis: Now Dad, in this world, is the Do-Good Foundation - right? The Do-Good-
Clint:: Fellowship.
Travis: —Fellowship. Is it actually based on— like, in canon based off of Benjamin Franklin’s concept or is that just you have been inspired by that?
Clint:: No, I think it’s probably— no, I think it was inspired by Ben Franklin’s Junto.
Travis: So there’s probably a portrait or two of Ben Franklin in the Do-Good Fellowship.
Clint:: Oh yeah. Yeah, and in addition to that also hanging in the Do-Good Fellowship there’s a symbol— and I sent it to all you guys and I’ll put it on Twitter as well— that’s kind of a cool stylized 24 incorporating a question mark and that represents the 24 questions that they would have at every meeting.
Griffin: I was wondering about that! You can see that in our new album art, which is very, very cool, and features sort of dramatic artistic takes on some of the ideas we’ve had for these experiment games. This’ll be sort of our temporary art while we do these experimental games and it’s— I love how it turned out.
Justin: Yeah, that’s, uh— Evan Palmer created our new album art that we’re using for the foreseeable future. Something that would be a little more flexible. We love our old art by Justin Gray, but it was very specific to that campaign and I think this is a new— new page. So, new art.
Clint:: Ok, so the Do-Good Fellowship has always kept the numbers very small, very manageable. You’ve always had 12— I guess you could call them department heads, and that has kept it easy to manage. And so they still maintain the twelve departments. Uh, so there are 12 departments represented in the Do-Good Fellowship, and each one has a department head.
You have Security, and that’s just sort of like the internal— it’s just that, it’s the security operation. You have Engineering, responsible for any kind of equipment. You have Transportation, which gets people to and from the base, to the action spots and the places they need to go. You have Facilities, which is just that, keeping the facilities up, feeding everybody, the day-to-day needs and requirements. You have R&D, research and development, which is very important as we’ll find out. There’s also Information Tech, which is the media and information gathering, also cyber security, they are very, very savvy to all of that.
Justin: It’ll be interesting to hear Dad roleplay those characters.
Travis: They totally know how stuff plugs in, and what switches—
Griffin: These superheroes— these superheroes set up their own printer.
Clint:: I need you to help me with Skype, Justin.
Clint:: Um— Risk Understanding, which is the the wing that makes decisions about where to actually send people to deal with things. You also have Diplomatics because the Fellowship works with all countries and people from all over. Legal, which works with all the legal issues. Finance, which handles the business and the acquisitions and getting funds.
Also Humanity, which is kinda their fancy word for human resources, for, you know, making sure people are taken care of. And then one of my favorites is Diversity/Inclusion, and this is a wing that is dedicated to making sure that everybody is represented in the decision-making process, to make sure that— you know, maybe you don’t go to the biggest emergency or the biggest conflagration, but you go to the most important and—
Griffin: To make sure that everybody has a voice. I gotcha.
Clint:: Right. Okay, so you have these— each one of these departments has a department head. The Fellowship has just had a major technical breakthrough, and they are using that for the next big expansion of the Fellowship. And that is to— to recruit one person for each department and, using this breakthrough technology, give them super abilities, to go out and deal with these situations that are going on all across the planet.
And you three are three of the people who have been recruited to be part of this effort. Now, just— I don’t want— I’m not telling you what your characters need to be or anything along those lines, but this is not just a job, this is kind of a... this is kind of a calling.
Griffin: Sure.
Clint:: Everyone is on board, really wanting to be part of this organization. So you three are three of the 12 new recruits that are coming in. Let me do one last thing, let me set the actual scene for you. It takes place on—
Travis: Smash cut!
Clint:: It takes place on—
Justin: Wait, I do want to touch on something. Can I make a formal request that we encounter the super accountant just as early as humanly possible.
Clint:: Oh, yeah—
Justin: [crosstalk] And the super lawyer—
Griffin: [crosstalk] I am so curious about the super— the super lawyer is going to be one—
Travis: Super Facilities Manager!
Clint:: The super— the super Humanities person is the one I’m excited about. It takes place on a gigantic floating base in the middle of the—
Travis: Wait, slow down.
Griffin: Well okay, hold on— you’ve kinda chomped my flavor a little bit. I called— you know I said, I get the only floating giant base, and you did it anyway and now I’m all P.O.ed.
Clint:: Well, I guess you have to redo your thing. That’s why—
Griffin: We can’t, we already fucking did our thing!
Travis: Oh yeah, we’ll just go back and redo all of Adventure Zone: Balance, Dad!
Clint:: I have to have a base!
Griffin: No, it’s fine. And it’s gotta be floating—
Clint:: It’s floating— it’s floating in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.
Travis: Oh, it’s floating on water!
Clint:: Yeah, and like 90% of it is below the surface of the water, 10% is— like an iceberg. It’s called the Roger, the Jolly Roger.
Travis: Okay, to be fair, isn’t that more like a submerged base, then? I mean if 90% of it is below the water, it’s not really a floating base.
Justin: I mean, it’s not touching the ground. So it’s floating in water.
Travis: That’s fair. Mm, good point, Justin. [crosstalk] We’re gonna have to take a break and discuss this.
Justin: [crosstalk] Thank you Travis.
Clint:: Imagine a diamond and then three offshoots from each point of the diamond. Okay? So almost like a, I dunno, like a snowflake or something. It’s a huge facility, each wing— each one of those 12 wings is where one of those departments is. And they call it the Jolly Roger just because it’s research and operations— the Do-Good Rectory is what it stands for, so they call it affectionately “The Jolly Roger.”
Justin: And some people call it the Iceberg or the Berg.
Clint:: Or the Snowflake.
Justin: Or the Peter Berg, who directed Battleship. So the Berg is kind of what we all just agreed to call it.
Griffin: Unfortunately it’s only going to be called the Berg. Sorry.
Travis: Yeah, the Berg!
Clint:: In the Berg! Okay, that works. So that kinda sets the scene for ya’. Um...
Griffin: I have a— I have a question just off the top of my head. So it sounds like superpowers are a discovery by this organization. Are we to assume that there— this is not going to be a sort of comic book story where we are going to be going toe-to-toe with countless supervillains out in the world who have powers and are using them to accomplish bad things?
Clint:: I think it is safe to say that, yes.
Griffin: Okay!
Clint:: I tell ya’, this is— you know, one of my influences is a 50 year old comic book series, um, the T.H.U.N.D.E.R Agents from Tower Comics. And of course this was in the height of spy movies and James Bond and The Man From U.N.C.L.E and Honey West and all of these things, and what they did was they introduced superpowers into an organisation— Thunder, T.H.U.N.D.E.R— and they went out and dealt with these kind of issues. So that was kind of a template for me? ‘Cause it was one of my favourite comics. You had Wally Wood art and you had Steve Ditko and Gil Kane and all these great comic artists.
Griffin: I think it’s interesting— I think it’s great. The idea of us not following the traditional arc of like ‘Uh oh! The Vulture’s here! Let’s get The Vulture!’ and instead like focusing on like actual issues. I think that’s really fascinating.
Justin: Do the people— so do the people who are currently in the organisation have superpowers?
Clint:: No.
Justin: Are they worried about us sort of just taking over it? ‘Cause it seems like that would be a concern if you had 12 people all of a sudden with superpowers, that they would want to be in charge.
Clint:: That’s why—
Travis: It would be hard to have like my boss really chew me out and it’s like ‘Laser eyes!’
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, ‘Eat shit!’ Yeah, ‘Pew!’ [Travis laughs]
Clint:: Well, there are certain controls in the— in giving you the powers. There are certain things that will— that’s a good point, but hopefully one of the things that’ll happen— while that is a real concern, one of the things that’ll happen is everybody’s on board for the cause.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Are we to assume that this technology is fairly new? That maybe like the outcomes of this process of giving people superpowers may not be like 100% well controlled?
Clint:: Exactly. Yeah. And you aren’t exactly the first guinea pigs, but this’ll be the first major implementation of the technology. In addition to the— there’s been a lot of biological screening to make sure that you’re, you know, your bodies are capable or have the capacity to handle this augmentation. So it’s not just something you can grant upon anybody. There’s certain genetic necessities that keep it from being just anybody can just get— boom!— have superpowers.
Travis: Well, cool. Should we talk about the characters we have planned?
Griffin: I think that’s probably a good next step. Sure! Who wants to— who wants to kick things off? We may also— like, this might be a good time for us to come up with our interpersonal aspects, which I think is an important thing that we just— we have not talked about at all.
Travis: Correct.
Griffin: So maybe we talk about our characters first, and then we figure out where the dots connect there.
Clint:: Yeah. As a matter of fact I think it’s important to the story that you guys establish who you are as people, who you were, before you were augmented, um, you know, and like we hinted at earlier, aspects are not just positives, they are negatives too. That’s what makes interesting storytelling is, you know, the things you have to overcome.
Griffin: Sure. Uh—
Justin: So are we talking about— in the context of this, are we talking about just our pre- right now, do we want to talk about our pre-superpower [crosstalk] characters?
Griffin: [crosstalk] I mean, we should also— I mean, this was such an important aspect in making them, we should also talk about the power suite that we have in mind for them?
Clint:: Oh yeah, I think so.
Justin: Okay.
Clint:: Like from instance if you—
Griffin: Even when you start the first proper episode, we will not have those powers yet.
Clint:: But, the aspects don’t necessarily have to reflect the powers. You know what I mean?
Justin: Yeah.
Clint:: The aspects should reflect who you are as a person, and then we can add an aspect afterwards if it’s something that comes about from the granting of the powers.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint:: Does that make sense?
Griffin: Sure, yeah, for sure. Uh, who wants to start?
Travis: I feel like I start every time. Every time we’ve done character creation—
Griffin: Why don’t I start, since I’ve never played a character before? This is my first character.
Travis: Oooooh!
Justin: Here we go!
Clint:: Yeah!
Griffin: Um, so I was trying to think of like what appealed to me in comics? I don’t read a lot of comics, and so I was trying to figure out like what I liked? Uh, there was a Spiderman fan comic called Your Friendly Neighbourhood Cowboy Bebop made by an artist named Hannah Blumenreich that I really enjoyed? Spiderman is probably my favourite superhero, and I liked the idea of just making a sort of acrobatic physical hero. And that comic is about sort of a Spiderman who is obsessed with Cowboy Bebop, which I have also been watching a lot of.
So I think those two are my biggest inspirations. Um, and I also have been watching a lot of Ninja Warrior lately, so that was a big inspiration for me. So like my character - the first idea I had was sort of a Cowboy Bebop-esque figure who - you know, was sort of this acrobatic, flexible, “use their own power against them” kind of fighter like Cowboy Bebop - Spike Spiegel is the name of the character - by way of like the wrestler Xavier Woods - was sort of my original inspiration? I’ve made this very inaccessible to my family on this recording and I apologise.
'Clint: laughs]
Travis: Yup.
Griffin: Um, but there are people listening who I think understand where I’m coming from. So my character is named Chris Rembrandt but everyone calls him Remy, is his name. And he was a high school gymnast and he was really good at gymnastics, um, he was - he made it on the 2008 Summer Olympic team, but he missed the games because shortly before he was supposed to leave his parents disappeared and while he was sort of figuring that out, he missed the games, which he is still pretty hung up about.
Um, and in the wake of that, he had a -you know- a hard time and he has a brother, a, uh—older brother and he sort of came together with him over Ninja Warrior because his brother also sort of a gymnast-type also, although never as accomplished as Remy was. And because of that they had a connection formed over them opening up a Ninja Warrior training gym in ‘enter city here’- I didn’t know what like- I didn’t know if this would be taking in a city so I kind of envisioned it taking place in that city.
Um, but I don’t know where it is so maybe we’ll just have to figure that out as we go. So um, his brother invested like all of his money in this gym and the idea is like that Remy would go on the television show Ninja Warrior and crush it and bring in clients for the gym, and what happened was the very first obstacle in the qualifiers - Remy, who’s probably had like a whole package dedicated to him, like, ‘the Olympic Ninja is here and he’s about to plant his flag in the ground’ - very first obstacle he is overconfident and he goes out. And it sort of a hugely embarrassing and probably, for those watching, like, hilarious thing that happened. He kind of embarrassed himself on television and-
Clint:: Was is those paddle things?
Griffin: It was the paddle things, and it’s like come on it’s paddle things everybody can clear the fucking paddle things, Remy. And because of that, like he didn’t get clients for the gym and so the gym is kind of failing, and so- at that point I think he just gave up on gymnastics and is so disill- because nothing has gone right in that particular part of his life- and started to, you know, find odd jobs to raise money to keep his brothers gym afloat, and one of those jobs was in IT for this organisation because, in addition to like his other traits, I think he’s also kind of a big nerd?
And he knows a lot about computers and other geek stuff, and so Remy found a place in this organization and is one of these candidates probably because of his other skill set that he doesn’t really talk about a whole lot. And sooo that is my character Remy. His superpower suite is called super agility, which basically gives him a lot of different bonuses whenever he’s doing anything with athletics. He also has what’s called natural weapon which just sort of represents how his super abilities allow him to fight really well. I like the idea of a superhero, with just like really powerful jumps and kicks. And his legs are very good.
Travis: He kicks super good!
Griffin: And um, in line with that, he can do these acrobatic feats, basically without having to roll, like they require very little effort. Uh, “leaping up to a second story window or from rooftop to rooftop across a wide alley way is a simple task that doesn’t require an athletics roll.” And then he has some other stuff, one ability called ‘cat’s landing’ where he can’t be hurt by falling which you know I’m going to use that do some dumb shit. Umm, and he has some Spiderman-like dodging abilities, which are going to be very useful.
There’s a really cool system- he’s also like a personal trainer, right? So I gave him some sort of flavour there, where he has skills in conversing with people, I think this is a character who like wants everybody to be their best? And wants to help everybody else get there? Because that’s what personal trainers do, and so I think that’s an aspect. He has a stunt called psychologist which sort of treats mental stress, so I think after a fight didn’t go well: ‘ah that’s okay, that’s okay, I’m going to help you out.’ And he’s also popular, is another skill I have, so if he’s in a place where people knows who he is then it’s going to help him out.
And so his high concept is Ninja Warrior themed personal trainer and his trouble is ‘family comes first’, which I think could be interesting. He’s kind of beholden to his brother, he feels this guilt. He’s very very close with his brother and he feels guilty that he is kind of responsible for his life not going very well right now. His brother also has a young son who he is very very close to, and he will do anything for them first and foremost, no matter what.
And then, we were supposed to come up with another aspect, and so one that I thought would be really interesting is ‘humiliated myself on national television’! There’s probably going to be situations where people are going to be like ‘oh shit you’re the Olympic Ninja, better watch out for them paddles man!’ [Clint: laughs] And so that is my- that is my concept for Remy, sort of an acrobatic, um, kind of Spider Man inspired figure. The superhero name I came up with is Spring Heel, which represents how he can jump super good and he’s very athletic and acrobatic and stuff.
Clint:: On your skill tree, what I was thinking about for skills, is that you basically have one Great, two Good, three Fair, and four Average. What I thought we’d do is apply those skills and then add a fifth one in Superb at the top after the superpowers. Would that be alright?
Griffin: Uh, yeah we can do- or we can bump the four up to a five? Because right now my highest skill is athletics, which represents how before I got these superpowers, I was an Olympic level like athlete, so like I already have that one filled in [Clint:: Okay] with the one I think should be highest for this character. And just to talk about my skills, like I said, it’s mostly, sort of athletics and you know physical fighting, which was like hand-to-hand, or in my case, foot-to-head.
But I also have some stuff in there for like, talking to people and helping people out with their stuff. I have crafts in there which is sort of the tinkering around with electronics which in my way of thinking is his like computer expertise. Um, so yeah, so that’s Remy, or Spring Heel which is what he will go by as his superhero name, and that is him. And again, I think that one thing we should all do is leave some gaps, like I don’t know where this gym is, I don’t have a name for the family quite yet, but I think we can maybe fill that stuff out as we go. Or maybe we won’t get around to it. Either way, I think it’s more interesting to sort of leave that stuff blank until we get to it.
Clint:: And he will be in Information Tech, right?
Griffin: Uh yes, he is in the IT department.
Clint:: Okay.
Travis: Can I talk- can I talk about mine? Because I think I have already been inspired by an interpersonal from Remy. Um, so when I started thinking about my character, I was inspired - two different kind of inspiration directions.
One, I kind of wanted to play a character who was as different from Magnus as I could think, and so I set about making a character who was very intellectual and analytical and also on a personal level, much more reserved as far as interpersonal relationships goes, and much more withdrawn, and then as far as kind of the abilities go, my two biggest inspirations were Green Lantern -who is my favourite superhero- and Mr Fantastic, and the thing I really liked about Mr Fantastic was this idea of if you really look at Mr Fantastic, it is not his, you know, elasticity that is his strongest ability, it’s his- it’s his brain. It’s the fact that he is one of the smartest people in the Marvel Universe and the elasticity is kind of a secondary thing. So my character, her name is Nadiya Jones, and her background is what I’m about to read to you on this piece of paper.
Nadiya Jones, 25, her mother is second generation British-Bangladeshi, her father is American, he never cared much about his ancestry past that, but often answered simply ‘Irish, German, I don’t know, what does it matter?’ Her parents divorced when she was three years old, and her mother returned to Britain, she has only seen her mother a few times since-
Griffin: Are you going to do a British accent?
Travis: No, she was raised in America
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Um-
Griffin: I’m down for it either way, I just wanted to--prepare myself--
Travis: No it would be so inconsistent and so terrible, I could never. She’s only seen her mother a few times since. Her father was granted sole custody and while he cared for her in his way, he was not a nurturing man. A scientist himself, he held several lucrative patents that allowed Nadiya a string of private tutors rather than attending school.
Her father worked as a highly paid consultant for the military, and so they bounced from one base to another with no permanent residence. So all those things kind of added together and interpersonal relationships hold very little interest to Nadiya, as she has never had much use for them. She can relate to other people just fine, she just doesn’t see the purpose.
She followed in her father’s footsteps, and many would argue, has surpassed his most impressive achievements. She earned her doctorate in Biochemistry at an impressively young age, which I left blank because I don’t know what an impressively young age to earn your doctorate in Biochemistry is [Griffin laughs], but it was, believe me! She also holds advanced degrees in Biotechnology and Biomedical sciences.
So my vision of her is a very big picture kind of scientist, and what’s interesting is that the work that she does is to benefit humanity but she doesn’t see much value in humanity on an individual basis. Like she doesn’t have friends, she doesn’t date. She just, like, doesn’t see the purpose of it, like her work is her life and science is her life. But the project that she was working on before engaging this kind of individual enhancement project was she had developed a - what she called a ‘smart biopolymer’ and basically, it can be used in skin grafts and mimics human skin, heals and adapts like human skin and has the sensitivity of human skin but can be made in a lab and doesn’t need skin donors. So that was the project she was working on before, keep that in mind.
Also she holds many lucrative patents herself, she is not doing this for the money, she is very rich so I actually, I gave her the skill resources as a-
Griffin: That’s a great one.
Travis: It’s a +2 skill.
Griffin: Yeah, there’s no--there’s no money in the game, there’s just a skill called “resources,” that you roll when you need to know if you have the thing and it’s like, oh yeah, I’m fuckin rich, I have the resources skill.
Travis: Yeah, it’s kind of the, you know, the Tony Stark/Bruce Wayne kind of skill. Um, so she has resources. I think that takes the form both of like, money, and also her lab? You know like, the resources to investigate something.
But her--her, so her high concept is hyper-focused scientist and her trouble is “values logic over humanity.” Think like Spock, that kind of deal, it’s like that kind of like highly analytical, isn’t going to rush to save a single person when she could take an action that would benefit a much larger group. Um, she, she is a good person, mind you, she’s not like an asshole or anything, but she just doesn’t, she’s not, she doesn’t rush in, is the thing.
Griffin: You mention that, I want to pause real quick just to say, I don’t think any of us are going to adhere to the sort of static archetypes that defined our characters, or your characters, in TAZ Balance. Like I don’t think of Remy as the Magnus this time around. He is also brilliant, like, he is not this sort of foolhardy jock who always rushes in.
Like, I wanna be careful here, because I wanna be sure that everyone understands, like, it’s not like this time, oh, this time Griffin is playing the unintelligent tank, and this time Travis is playing the, you know, cerebral Taako--not that that’s how I’d describe Taako, necessarily, I don’t think there’s a correlation there--I just wanna be clear that like, we are not going to be filling those sort of traditional archetypes if you guys know what I’m saying, like does that makes sense?
Travis: Yep. Yeah, Nadiya, I created her pretty whole--like, specifically because it was a version of a character I was interested in playing, whereas I made Magnus because I wanted to fill a role in like, in traditional D&D you need a fighter, you need a caster, you need a healer.
Griffin: That’s gonna take us some time to--when we talked about what we were gonna do next, I remember having a conversation with you, Travis, where you were like, I don’t understand how we fill the 4 usual party archetypes with 3 people, and it was like, no, you don’t have to--we don’t have to be healer, tank, magic user, and nimble fighter, like that’s not, that’s not how RPGs have to work, nor should they work.
Travis: Yes. So, um, my vision of her, um, super--Let me run through her skills. Her great is a skill I call Science! exclamation point. Um--
Griffin: You made your own skill?
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: You can’t make your own skills.
Travis: But I did. Um, you can actually, that is part of Fate, I read through it, like the skills are a suggestion, you can make your own that fit your character, um, because Lore is one of them but I wanted something very specific to her--
Griffin: Why don’t we do this--why don’t we just call the craft skill “Science!” because there are rules in place for Crafts and it sounds like you’re describing kind of the same--
Travis: Okay, we can call it that, but I’m still gonna call it Science! With an exclamation point. Because I want to be able to say “I want to use Science!” Um, and so, her other skills in the Good category are “Will” and “Investigate.” Um, in Fair is “Intimidate, Lure, and Resources,” and in Average I have “Notice” and “Athletics” because in addition to having a disciplined mind, I think she also takes care of herself. She’s in a biomedical field, she has, you know knowledge of the human body, she takes good care of herself. She’s not like--you know, I don’t think she’s at the level of Remy or anything but I, you know, she can run if she needs to, that kinda thing.
Griffin: We also--
Clint:: Uh, to kind of address--to kind of address that and also Griffin’s suggestion about intelligence, remember these are the cream of the crop.
Travis: Yep
Clint:: Through the selection process the Fellowship has done, they’re going to be good physical and mental specimens.
Travis: And to that point, my vision of her as far as the superpowers went, I think she was selected of course because of her intellect and knowledge and, you know rapid analytical mind, but when I think that when she goes through the process what ends up triggering is because of her exposure to this biopolymer and she has, you know, tested it on herself and that kind of thing, you know, just tiny patches, that kind of thing--but I think that that triggers, and I think what ends up happening is she ends up with the skill to shape her body, um, both as weapon and as defense so that she can--
Griffin: Is there a power in the book for that?
Travis: Um, I’m tweaking one--
Clint:: Shapeshifting is in there.
Travis: Yes, shapeshifting but rather than having it be animal based, it’s inanimate based, is basically my slight change to it.
Griffin: Cool.
Clint:: Yeah, so it’s kind of a Green Lantern--
Griffin: Or like a Mr. Fantastic, it sounds like,
Travis: Yeah, so basically if Mr. Fantastic had to shape specific objects, like, turn his hand into a hammer and that kind of thing, but it takes a Will roll to do it, and the drawback is, the power is physically exhausting, so if she relies on it too much, it - she’ll faint. She’ll pass out. It is physical exertion to control the power, it’s not an instantaneous thing. So she uses it as an attack, but her first line of attack and defense is a skill I re-named Knowledge is Power.
It’s actually called in the thing something like Shield of Knowledge or something but I called it Knowledge is Power. Where basically she can use Science! as the attack and defense skill, but I have to be able to justify that science applies to the situation. But basically she is much more analytical kind of fighter and approaches the situation very disassociated from it? To like, figure out the best way to proceed in it. So her skills much more pertain to breaking down what needs to happen and addressing the concerns--the issues--rather than fighting.
Griffin: So she was in R&D, I’m assuming?
Travis: Yeah, she was in R&D.
Griffin: And does she have a superhero name or something?
Travis: Her superhero name is Nadiya Jones. She doesn’t go in for that
Griffin: Ah! So you have this Tony Stark sort of revealed identity thing going on.
Travis: Very much so. She doesn’t do this for the flight of fancy. So basically, this is where it comes down to, I think that she sees Remy as a failure. I think she sees him as a representation of failure where she has always succeeded.
Griffin: I don’t--it feels weird to have such a combative like, thing starting out.
Travis: Okay, let me do it a different way, then.
Griffin: ‘Cause I still want this to be a positive story about people who, like I think that was a defining characteristic of Balance was that it was a story about people who care about each other, and who wanna take care of each other--Like I think that “You’re a failure” is maybe--
Travis: Okay, let me put it this way--
Clint:: Wait, wait though, this is a team just coming together
Griffin: That’s true. Can aspects change?
Clint:: They’re not gonna, well, I mean, you don’t have to invoke it, I don’t guess.
Travis: I would say that basically what it comes down to, to justify my choice, Griffin, is I think that Nadiya represents someone who, her whole life has been about honing her mind and being the best, and being the best she can be so she can do the best, you know, and create the best and everything about her is about the best the best the best and I think that on some level she sees Remy being elevated in the same group that she is as an insult? Not necessarily a personal insult from Remy, I don’t think she holds it necessarily against him, so much as she looks at it as an insult of the choice being made that they are on the same level?
Griffin: Yeah, I--I understand what you’re saying, but it’s like Remy was also an Olympic level athlete who also worked to like, do that same stuff--
Travis: But he didn’t go. He chose humanity over success, which Nadiya would never do.
Clint:: Yeah, I like the dynamic--I like the dynamic
Griffin: I think it’s interesting, I think it’s a good angle, I just think “Remy is a failure” is maybe too harsh of a way of phrasing the actual--
Justin: Like, Remy failed himself. [crosstalk]
Travis: How about this, Remy encouraging others to succeed - she sees as hypocritical.
Griffin: That could be good, or like, I think Justin’s suggestion is not a bad one,
Travis: What was it?
Griffin: About like, Remy failed himself or something like that? Then it’s less like, he’s a piece of shit, and more like--
Travis: [crosstalk] How about this: Remy needs to be pushed.
Griffin: That’s great. That’s excellent. And that’s like, can I suggest another one, and this might be off-limits, but like, I think Remy has specific reasons for having a hidden identity which is like, the same reasons that all superheroes do which is that it limits your--it limits collateral damage to people you care about. And it sounds like Nadiya doesn’t have like a ton of people in her life that fill that category
Travis: [crosstalk] Uh, zero.
Griffin: But I think that exposed identity is a really cool aspect that could be used for all kinds of things.
Travis: Yeah I think, I think let’s keep exposed identity as just a general one, because I also like that, so “Remy needs to be pushed” and “exposed identity”.
Clint:: Well now, “Remy needs to be pushed,” that’s her opinion? Or is that a fact? Because if it’s a fact then it would be Remy’s--
Griffin: No, I don’t think that--I think that’s her thing. I think Remy’s great.
Travis: Yeah, I think that, being part of this team it is important to her that this team is a success, and she knows that in Remy’s past he has allowed himself to fail because he has allowed himself to think too much--to feel too much? Instead of thinking logically, and so I think that now that she is a part of this team she sees it as an extension of herself, and so if any member of the team fails, it is a failure reflected upon her. So I’m gonna go with “Remy needs to be pushed” and “exposed identity.”
Clint:: OK.
Griffin: That’s great.
Clint:: And she will be in R&D.
Travis: Yes. Nadiya Jones. N-A-D-I-Y-A J-O-N-E-S.
Clint:: Okay.
Griffin: Um, real quick, before we go to Justin’s character, let’s go to the Money Zone? We’ve never had a name for it--
Travis: The Zone Zone...the..the...the Loot Zone
Griffin: Okay, I wanna tell you first off--
Travis: The Treasure Zone!
Griffin: The Treasure Zone. Okay, I wanna tell you first off about Blue Apron. Because we use Blue Apron in this house, and we love it, and we respect it, it’s a really great service where for less that 10 bucks per person per meal they will deliver seasonal recipes along with pre-proportioned ingredients that you can use to make delicious home-cooked meals
[53:00
MONEY ZONE
59:20]
Justin: Lastly, I wanted to talk about my character, uh, thank goodness we had the ads in there to give me the time to make one up. Um, what a relief that was. Just kidding, just a little fun joke. Just a little humor between friends. Uh, so I’m playing as--when we begin, I’ll be playing as a character called Irene Baker, and she is in the Human Resources department of the organization, she got her MBA in Human Resources, and she is basically the best.
Paycheck didn’t come in, you need to get some health insurance, you got a problem with a coworker you need solved, you need a softball team organized, she is the person to talk to. She, likes Dad Rock, like Elvis Costello and Wilco, that’s her--in her private life she has some eclectic tastes like that but, in the office she is really sort of the glue that holds everybody together. She makes sure everybody’s getting along and makes sure that it’s a great environment for everyone and makes sure that the trains run on time. Um, she’s uh-
Travis: Justin, can I ask a question?
Justin: Yeah, please.
Travis: Is she cool?
Griffin: Or is she a narc? [Justin laughing]
Travis: Yeah, do people like her? Or are they like, “Oh she’s fine to hang out with, but like, y’know, she’s very HR all the time.”
Justin: I would say that she probably doesn’t have a ton of great friends at the office but she’s someone that everybody likes. But like less of the close connection because she’s very focused on making sure that everybody is getting along and everything's going swimmingly. She’s a little reserved, and a little bit mousy, I would say, but she’s not unlikeable, she’s a likeable person.
Except, when I was going to create a character for this, I really struggled, because I… I don’t know, sometimes I’m not a very creative person, it takes a while for something to come to me, I’m sorry, but that’s just the truth. And the idea that I eventually hit on was kind of unnerving for me because it’s kind of out of my lane for a little bit and I was nervous about doing it but the longer I tried to put it off and come up with something different, I couldn’t, and this idea kept on stirring around in my brain. So.
For a while now, I’ve been sort of interested in Inuit mythology. It’s something that we don’t see represented a lot, I think, in popular culture. We’re very much inundated with the mythology of the Greeks and the Romans and the, uh, Norse mythology and what have you but we don’t get a lot of--there are some mythologies that I think are unrepresented and I think Inuit mythology specifically is really interesting. Now, I am not attempting to, you know, directly sort of tap into that or make a 100% perfect simulation of Inuit mythology because I that would, I think, not be--
Griffin: That would be pretty inappropriate, it would be bad.
Justin: It would not be great. But I’m definitely inspired by that. I think it’s a really interesting--the more I thought about it the more I thought that it was something I really wanted to try. Irene is someone who I think, uh, that is definitely her culture, but I don’t think it’s something she’s particularly connected to, but it is definitely her, her, sort of, background. And so it is something that I have definitely tried my best to learn about, familiarize myself with, and talk to people about, and that is what I am trying to attempt with Irene Baker.
So, Irene Baker, the best way to describe--the thing about her transformation--it is very much a transformation. When she gets her powers, she becomes the thunder goddess named Kardala. And Kardala is somewhat inspired by Kadlu, who is a thunder goddess in Inuit mythology, um, so Kardala has-- is basically a juggernaut, she is incredibly strong, incredibly tough, uh, has control of the weather, her main power suite is basic weather control, so she can create weather, she can use weather to attack people, and sort of has the ability to control weather and uses that against her enemies.
Her secondary power which is a synthesis in the nomenclature of inter city is super toughness, so she is very hard to bring down. And she is very strong, and sort of operating at peak physical capability, but she is also very different from Irene in so much as they are practically the inverse of each other. I’m very much thinking of sort of an Inuit mythology version of Thor and the more I thought about that idea the more it sort of resonated with me and seemed like something I’d really like to try to do a good job with.
So that is Kardala in a nutshell. Her main trait, the main concept is that she is a thunder goddess among mortals, and she does not value or even approach humans in the same way that Irene does, in fact, quite the opposite. I think that, for Kardala, she sees the other people with super abilities as somewhat on her level and I think she sees people without them as humans that need to be perhaps shepherded, perhaps protected somewhat, but does not consider them as her equals in any way, shape, or form, and I think that colors who she is as a character and that is her trouble aspect in the venture city fate corp nomenclature - she struggles with having a mortal’s perspective on things
Griffin: Is this something--I want to make this clear--is this something she believes or is it the truth. Is she actually inhabited by Kardala?
Justin: When she is Kardala, that is her. Okay? But, there is one other aspect, that I have - oh so cleverly, in my patented Justin McElroy style, called On Comes Irene-- [laughter]
Justin: That trait is that
Travis: Oh, I see!
Justin: Yeah. At inopportune times, or maybe opportune times, depending, Kardala can revert to Irene. I have a separate character sheet for Irene Baker, who shares the physical things like, consequences and what have you, would be shared across the two, so I can’t use it to game whatever, but her skills are very much the inverse of Kardala’s
Griffin: That is fucking great. This is such a good character and such a good game
Justin: She’s very good at--when she’s Irene, she has high ratings in Empathy, in Rapport, in- Rapport, which can be a defensive skill in Fate, and that is, Irene has those skills, but in physical confrontations, Irene is severely lacking, so that is sort of the, a big problem with Kardala and--
Griffin: Does that--does she have absolute control over when the transformations
Travis: Yeah, that’s what I wanted to ask
Justin: I would say that if she had absolute control it would be a little too OP, because I don’t want it to be a situation--or overpowered, sorry--
Griffin: Like, I need athletic skills, so now I’m the thunder goddess.
Justin: Exactly, right, or I need to be empathetic right now, so now I’m this. It’s more about, I think, one, places where it would be a good story opportunity for one or the other to manifest, but also a way of, uh, I think balancing that very sort of distant god character. I’m actually thinking of a specific manifestation of Thor that was in, of all things, a made-for-TV movie that I believe was called The Death of the Incredible Hulk, and it was this very cool--it was a very funny take on Thor where it was all about him sort of adjusting to human life.
And you see that trait too, I think, somewhat in the more recent adaptations of Thor but very much a, a goddess among mortals and that is the way she is approaching the world, so she can’t--I would say maybe if she concentrated very hard there is perhaps a chance that she could become Irene Baker, but I would say that the bias I would have is that I don’t think Kardala would necessarily see any benefit to doing that, so it would be very hard to justify.
Griffin: It also puts a huge arrow in Dad’s quiver to drop a compel and make you be who ever is going to be whoever is going to be the most narratively interesting and challenging for you to be at any point. That is like the strength of this system and stuff like this proves the worth of this system.
Justin: Yeah, and I think that--Kardala for me--I think that Irene as a character for me is not, perhaps, super connected to this mythology personally, and I think that makes it a really interesting counterpoint for her to actually manifest some portion of a version of that mythology. So, that is what I am going for.
Griffin: I also want to say, and I know this is not something you would do, but something we should probably make clear, which is, this is not going to be a, like, manifestation of like bipolar disorder, for instance, which is a real thing that folks suffer from? This is, I do not believe that this is your, you know, ‘What if that was a superpower?’ sort of thing. Like, that’s not something we would ever do.
Justin: Yeah, and that’s why I want to make it clear that this is not a delusional state. This is, that is what she is in that moment. That is, that is who she becomes. And whether or not that is metaphorical or literal, I don’t know, we probably don’t have enough episodes to cover it so--
Griffin: I say that not to stigmatize bipolar disorder but just to say that like, it would not be appropriate for any of us to say, “Well, what if it was, wouldn’t it be a cool superpower?” Like, that’s not--that just doesn’t-
Justin: Yeah, I feel like, and again I know that just like, a lot like I did with Taako, this is not necessarily--this is not like a character that was drawn on my own experience, and so I’m, I’m obviously really hesitant about doing it but also as we’ve talked about so many times on this show and what have you, we are four straight cis white dudes and I just don’t feel like a show--a team--made of straight cis white dudes entirely is very interesting or sustainable or valuable or useful.
Griffin: Yeah. I also will say-
Justin: As always, we’re doing our best, and we’re--ya know, we’re trying our best
Griffin: You’ve talked to some people who deal with Inuit representation in media, which I think is very--I’m very proud of you for having put in that effort--
Justin: Yeah, it’s a hell of an email, y’all. It’s a long way to walk around before you get to the part, it’s a long road before you get to part where you understand why I’m emailing.
Clint:: Let me ask you this, and you may have touched on this and I just missed it--Is there a physical manifestation of the change between Irene?
Justin: Oh yeah, she’s huge.
Clint:: Okay.
Justin: She’s huge, yep.
Clint:: Okay, well there’s also another aspect that’s going to be built into this that deals with the--
Justin: Kardala--sorry I should be more clear--a height--a height difference. There’s a physical change. Irene is smaller and I think? Now that you say that, I hadn’t really thought about it, I think maybe a little more stout? And Kardala is just big. She’s tall and strong and--I was about to say down to get the friction on? I actually don’t know if that’s accurate, or not, but there ya go.
Clint:: Also the technology will lend itself in an aspect of this as well, that I will reveal when you get your powers. I also want to say that it was the Return of the Incredible Hulk, with Thor played by Eric Kramer, who you all know from The Thundermans.
Justin: Motherfucker, don’t try to act like you didn’t just google that.
Clint:: I did just google that!
Justin: Okay! Well at least we’re agree.
Griffin: I want to add an aspect? ‘Cause like, we have to add some for each other? I like the idea that Irene’s human-focused approach to her day-to-day thing? And that seems very sympathetic with like how Remy thinks about people and why he joined this organization and I like the idea of an aspect for me of like, “We can trust Irene’s instincts”. As just like, that way, if Irene wants to make a decision, yeah, I think Remy would be like, well, she has everybody’s interests in mind, and she’s approaching that scenario from a very human-oriented place, and so I am down with it. Does that make sense?
Clint:: Yeah, and that’s a nice balance, also, to Trav’s character
Griffin: Yeah, so, I think--Irene would need one for Nadiya just so that we have one for each other.
Justin: I think more useful would be one for Kardala, because I think Kardala would be more prominent, rather than Irene? I think Irene would have different, sort of a different take on these characters. But I think that Irene believes that Nadiya is a demon. I mean I think that she literally believes that, she is unnerved by Nadiya’s abilities and she finds them very upsetting.
Travis: Irene does, or Kardala does?
Justin: Kardala does. Yes. Because Kardala also has Lore as one of her abilities. I think Kardala has a, like an awareness of other parts of that mythology? And I think that she would be unner--like, she is convinced that Nadiya is a demon. Not necessarily--
Griffin: Like a literal--
Justin: A literal demon. That she needs to be wary of.
Clint:: Oh, I love that.
Travis: What I love about that is I think--I was going to suggest kind of a similar thing, but for Irene, where I imagine Nadiya has been complained to HR a lot about? Like I think that a lot of people have issues with Nadiya, she’s not very good at interacting with humans in any kind of nice way, and so I imagine that there have been a lot of complaints about her made?
Griffin: So this idea of, you could have one aspect on Irene that’s like, I want to help Nadiya open up. And then when you transform, you think that she’s an actual literal demon from Hell.
Justin: Right.
Clint:: That’s awesome.
Justin: That’s sort of my logic that it sort of colored that perception, I think. Parts of where their personalities I think sort of overlap.
Travis: God that’s so cool dude--I love that.
Griffin: This is very good.
Travis: That presents so many interesting moments, yep. I like these! I like these characters we’ve done.
Griffin: I do too! So these are the characters we’re gonna be playing in the game we’re gonna be playing, um, and--
Clint:: And you are going to be-- you said HR, so Humanities--Humanities Division.
Justin: Yep HR.
Griffin: And like I said we’re going to be playing a few episodes with these and just sort of exploring the space, and I think we’re going to do some--what gives me hope about this, like, I was really nervous about the idea of moving away from Balance, and to be frank, like since we’ve wrapped up Balance um, my head has been in a really weird place. Partially because I’m not creating in the way that I used to when we were doing the show, and there’s always nerves like, “oh, we’re going to be doing this new thing.”
But Adventure Zone Nights I thought was really fun, and I thought we did some interesting stuff there, and the opportunity to do that a lot of times I think is going to end up being really, really great. Dad, do you have anything else you want to say, to like set up this first episode well?
Clint:: Well, I think, just a couple things to keep in mind. We’re going to start, you will get your powers in that first episode. And I think it’s going to be kind of, kind of a mystery as to how your powers are going to manifest? I mean, not to us as the players, because we already kind of have an idea but I think in fiction--except for, I think Nadiya, I think has an idea. I think that just is too--she’s working in R&D so I’m sure she’ll have an idea--
Griffin: R&D, right.
Clint:: So I think she might have an idea of this might happen to some respect but I’ll let you guys figure out the reaction to that. But we will start non-powered. There’s a big cast of NPCs--not nearly as big as the whole, you know, 69 episodes of Balance but you, you’re not going to be thrust into a situation where you’re going to have remember a bunch of names and everything else right off the bat.
And you’ll get your first mission and everything will kind of take from there. Uh, and also wanted to tell folks that there are similarities I guess with Balance in that there’s an organization and there’s going out on missions, but if you really stop to think that’s kind of a basic, at least for a start-up story, to kind of operate from. So when I steal, I steal from Griffin.
Travis: Great.
Griffin: Steal from the best! That’s what they say!
Clint:: I’m really excited, I’m really pumped up about it, I think you guys are going to really enjoy the story, but I’m already digging the characters, so.
Griffin: Yeah, and I’m going to say this a lot, and this is sort of the sentiment we all have, which is, please be patient with us, and bear with us, and get-- I hope you can get as excited with this process as we are going to get, because I anticipate that we will get folks telling us, I liked Balance better, and Balance was an incredibly great and special thing that is always going to mean a lot to us, but it had to end when it ended and I want the next thing--the next full season that we make to be not just as good and as special as Balance was but even better and I think this is going to get us there.
Like doing stuff like this, and seeing, like figuring out the best stuff in all the games, and figuring out what suits our play style, and the way that we put a show and a story together the best, like figuring that stuff out is what’s going to make for the best second season. So, umm, keep in mind that this is a short thing, a temporary thing and we’re going to be trying some stuff out and we hope that you enjoy the result of that. Uh, I think that’s it though.
Travis: Yes, yes.
Griffin: Uh, thank you all for listening. Remember it’s #thezonecast, tell a friend to listen to it. Uh, again, it’s going to be, as we transition here it’s going to be very important that you help spread the word if you think like, oh I have a friend who’s into comic books, shit, go listen to this thing, that would mean a lot because you know it’s harder to keep retention and everything when you’re doing something like this. So anything you can do really means a lot.
Justin: And this is a great time, perhaps the best, to get people on board but um, thank you, more than anything, even if you don’t share with anybody, thank you to you, dear listener, for hanging in with us, we, this show literally I think would not exist had you not responded to it the way you had and it means a lot to us that you’re still here listening. So thank you.
Travis: You’re great!
Griffin: Uh, and thank you to MaximumFun.org. Check out all the great podcasts there. You can listen to other stuff we do and see our videos and stuff stuff at McElroyShows.com. Go to the ComicCon panel if you’re going to be at New York ComicCon. Is that it?
Travis: Yep!
Clint:: Yep!
Griffin: Cool. Well, the next episode’s going to be up in 2 weeks on Oct 19th and that’s going to be the first episode of our new arc, TAZ Commitment, so we will talk to you then. Bye!
Travis: Bye!

[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Commitment Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Clint:: Okay, hi everybody! Welcome to The Adventure Zone. I am your internet father, Clint McElroy.
Griffin: Don’t say that! That’s bad— that’s— [crosstalk]
Travis: That’s weird!
Clint:: Is that a bad thing?
Justin: That’s a weird look.
Griffin: Yeah, that's no good. Definitely a weird look.
Clint:: Alright, I’ll back off of that. I am your GM. Your game master—
Justin: Your Griffin McElroy?
Clint:: The general manager.
Justin: Oh.
Clint:: Along with my three sons. Go ahead and identify your guy— yourselves, guys.
Travis: Did you— I wanna say, this is a weird start. Are we assuming people listening to this episode have never heard this before?
Clint:: Yeah! I'm anticipating a whole new influx of new blood.
Justin: Fresh start, my name is Justin McElroy, I'm your oldest brother, and I'm portraying the dual roles of Irene Baker and Kardala.
Travis: I’m Travis McElroy, I'm the middlest brother, and I am portraying Nadiya Jones.
Griffin: Folks ‘round here call me Griffin McElroy, I'm playing the role of Remy, and I'm going to try to watch how much I talk because I got a lot of tweets from people, maybe a little mean spirited, accusing me of backseat DMing [Clint laughs] during the world building episode we did. So, imma watch that because I was very sensitive about that, and it did hurt my feelings [Clint: Aww] and maybe it was— maybe it was all me, but words hurt and my feelings are fragile.
Travis: Like, here’s the thing, the real— real question we have to address then is— is it— let's take it back to backseat driving. Is it backseat driving if the driver has no idea where they're going, and you in the backseat are giving helpful directions?
Griffin: If the driver of the car is some sort of baby who's never driven a car before or perhaps [Travis: Right] a big wild dog who jumped in through the window, yeah I would backseat drive on that one ‘cause otherwise— [crosstalk]
Clint:: I’ll tell you what: if I get us lost, you guys can step in, how's that sound?
Griffin: Um [Justin: Okay] that sounds good. We should mention that you should go listen to the world building episode you wanna know anything about the thing we're doing because I think dad just kinda wants to hop into it, right?
Clint:: Yeah, and there will be some recapping involved in that process.
Griffin: Okay. [crosstalk]
Travis: We did a whole hour and a half long episode.
Griffin: Yeah, we did a lot. [Justin: Yeah] We should also mention that we're using Roll20, and we’re gonna not refer to the board that you put together, ‘cause the visual element won't necessarily carry over, but there's always a lot of very good, very stretched out jpgs on this baby.
Justin: A lot of, Dad put together this imagery. There's a lot of fun with aspect ratios happening.
Clint:: Yeah that's real fun [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] There’s three— three laser barriers—
Travis: I also like that in dad’s clip art search, he apparently found two like, people kind of icons, and the rest are a cat, what looks like a blood splatter but purple, a glowing blue eye, a brain—
Griffin: A floating brain. I can't wait to talk to brain.
Justin: Uh, I went ahead and screencapped this so if you go ahead and tweet me and remind me, I'll get it out there later.
Griffin: Okay, Dad, weave a tale. I want it. [Justin: Weave.] I want it. I'm ready.
Clint:: Alright, you three are brand new recruits to an organization called The Do Good Fellowship. Uh, and it basically is a humanitarian organization that goes around the world helping people in trouble. It's a very simple edict of what they do. Um, and you three are part of the newest expansion of this organization, um, up ‘till now they've been sort of like a think tank, creating ideas, identifying trouble spots, but they now wanna get boots on the ground, so they have instituted the new program where they are bringing in their next... circle, I guess, and these are operatives, you are three of the twelve new operatives that are being brought in.
So, your three characters were brought in on these really cool little VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) Ships called skimmers, called so because they kinda skim along the surface of the water, or on the land, or whatever. And, reported to a place you have affectionately named—
Travis: So, wait, just to clarify they do vertical take off and landing and two inches off the ground?
Griffin: And then they fly reeeal low. I feel like— I feel like (stammering) It's not what they're designed to do, it's just all the pilots at the fellowship are just real cocky pieces of shit.
Clint:: I want to visualize this, that there's this spray up behind them as they skim along—
Griffin: Oh, I got that spray, I got that spray.
Travis: Oh yeah, spray, spray locked in.
Clint:: It's very Baywatch-y.
Griffin: Are we on the Berg right now, the headquarters for the fellowship?
Clint:: Yeah, we have flown into the Berg which is the giant floating platform headquarters for The Do-Good Fellowship, that is located toward the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. So it's outside of United States territorial waters, and outside any other.
Griffin: I do a murder, because nobody can do anything about it, what's up?
Travis: Yeah, I open a floating casino.
Clint:: You guys— you have— it is a Giant Floating Casino of Hope. [Justin laughs] So, right off the bat when you land, you land separately, there’s three different vehicles. These skimmers, by the way, are like drones. They're operated from the actual Berg themselves.
Travis: What's the beverage service like?
Clint:: There are some light beverages, but if you want wine or beer, you have to pay.
Travis: Ugh, that's how they get ya.
Clint:: Everything else is complimentary, and then there's peanuts. And these are specially grown peanuts—
Griffin: I’m allergic to peanuts, I— [crosstalk]
Griffin: Oh, ‘cause I was gonna say, I’m allergic to peanuts, you’re saying I've eaten peanuts for the first time... I’m adding by the way, the aspect of being allergic to peanuts to my sheet.
Clint:: So, the very first thing you're greeted by your three department heads, your separate department heads, Remy you are in Information Technology, Irene is in Humanities, and Nadiya, you are in Research Development. So, you are greeted by your three department heads, Nadiya’s department head is named Joe, Remy’s department head is Potts, Irene’s department head is Grace.
You will be meeting all three of these like, right now. So after a quick stop to freshen up in your quarters, you go to this, what they're calling, a mixer, and that's where our first scene takes place.
Travis: Question one, is it mandatory?
Clint:: Yes.
Travis: Okay, then Nadiya is there.
Clint:: Okay, right off the bat, you're mixing with strangers. So, I know that’s not exactly Nadiya’s wheelhouse— [crosstalk]
Travis: It's not that she can't do it, I wanna be clear, it’s not that she can't do it—
Clint:: Right.
Griffin: She doesn't prefer it.
Travis: She has more important things to do with her time.
Griffin: Remy’s pressin’ the flesh.
Travis: Gross. Gross, gross, gross.
Clint:: Is that an aspect? Is that one of her aspects?
Travis: What? Yes.
Clint:: She has better things to do with her time then to go meet people?
Travis: That's not really an aspect, just a fact. It fits in with my overarching aspect of Values Logic Over Humanity. Hyper-focused scientist, I would say that falls under.
Clint:: There you go, okay. Well, when you walk in this gigantic, room, it's called the Fellowship Hall, and it's kind of a general purpose, meeting, debriefing kind of a very flexible arrangement, and you notice when you walk in through the door there are three screens covering almost the entirety of the three walls.
Directly in front of you is a great big screen that has the twenty four questions logo, the two four question mark logo, which is very important to The Do-Good Fellowship. And that screen has a big representation of the logo on it, kind of a scroll at the bottom that's keeping you up to date on local weather and [Travis: Heat scores] you know, what's going on. Yeah, and music that’s playing. We’ll get to that in just a minute. But in front of that screen, great big free open self serve bar. [Justin: Nice] So right off the bat, the bartender is an anomaly in my graphic.
Travis: Tell me more about the bartender, because he looks very stretched out—
Clint:: He's not, that's not, I shouldn't have— [crosstalk]
Griffin: Is that his power, that he can stretch super good?
Clint:: It’s, yeah, I tried to crop him out, but I failed.
Travis: No no no dad, I'm sorry, I know you're new to this, but when you GM a game, and you have the chance to create a bartender, you create the hell out of that bartender.
Griffin: You need to make a bartender. [crosstalk]
Clint:: Well, let's just say that one of the department heads is working bar [Griffin: That's fine.] Let’s say, Parson, let’s say Parson is tending this bar just as a lark. This is a small operation, there are twenty four people on this base covering all these different jobs [crosstalk]
Travis: Parson is the department head of Risk Understanding. We know this because Dad has helpfully created a cheat sheet of all the characters and their positions.
Clint:: On the left side wall, the giant projection screen has this really cool, like color coded map of the Berg. Where all the different sections are, and every so often it will zoom in and show the different people that work there and show some of the things they do. Kind of an industrial film about The Do-Good Fellowship.
And over on the right side projection screen, is just cutting to the different shots of the actual mixer. The different people at the mixer, and what they're doing. Maybe there's some dancing, there's a dance floor in the middle, people are dancing, because the music is playing constantly. In front of that screen is this really cool high-tech jukebox, where you just go, it's voice activated, and you can make a request of practically any song on the planet.
So, you look up on that screen, the middle screen, there is the part of the scroll that is the songs that are playing, and who they're by, and who requested it. So, there's music playing, you’ve got the bar in front of the top screen, you've got the jukebox on the right side. There are four tables about chest-high, abdomen-high, no seats, there's no chairs. This is a mixer, I don't want people sitting and just staying there. Then you’ve got four tables in the different corners of the room with all kinds of different food, all finger food, tapas kind of thing, from all over the world [Griffin: They got sliders?] Any what?
Griffin: Sliders.
Clint:: Oh, they make sliders of every— there's a whole table of nothing but sliders.
Justin: Nice.
Travis: Butt sliders? Gross!
Griffin: Remy’s going on what he's called a slider quest, which is he's going from table to table just, trying trying all the sliders, ‘cause maybe there's different sliders at the other table. Oh no, this is the same slider, but I'll keep trying.
Clint:: All four of these tables have all these different kinds of foods and all these different really interesting things. And like I said, the jukebox, the songs don't stop, people keep going up to the jukebox and making song requests, you've got the four food stations, you've got the full open bar where you could serve yourself, but Parson has decided he’ll just have some fun and he’ll get up there. Alphabet City by Prince, requested by Abbey, is playing right now. At least, that's what the scroll says and so—
Griffin: I look at Abbey and give her a big thumbs up. Good call.
Clint:: It's playing, so you got your four tables, six people at a table, and the table that you are at right now is the table that has you three and your three directors sitting there. So, this seems to be kind of the meet and greet portion of the mixer so take the opportunity to kinda get to know each other, your department heads have introduced you just barely, but you know I think everybody at the table would like to know a little bit about ya, so...
Travis: Nadiya gets up to go request a song.
Clint:: Okay, what does Nadiya request?
Travis: Uh, I’m going to type it in the chat.
Griffin: Oh boy. [crosstalk]
Clint:: [laughing] Okay—
Griffin: If it’s gonna be like LMFAO that would be quite a surprise for— oh, Justin actually wrote “Aspect: allergic to peanuts,” thank you.
Clint:: [Laughing]
Griffin: Okay, that's a very good song for Nadiya.
Clint:: “She Blinded Me with Science” is playing, by Thomas Dolby, so it says “She Blinded Me With Science by Thomas Dolby, requested by Nadiya.” So that starts thrumming up after Alphabet City.
Irene: Grace, um, I uh wanted you to know that I, I checked on Godfreys’ uh, uh insurance you were asking me, he will be eligible next, um, month, first of the month, if he wants to switch because it’s on an every six month basis, so he’ll be able to switch then.
Grace: That's nice Irene, but this— this is a party, honey! This is a party, you don’t have to worry about working!
Irene: I know, yeah I know, I just wanted to let you know, so I’ll check in with him on it,
Grace: Yup.
Grace: sorry, I’m really nervous.
Grace: Ah, don’t worry, do you want to share a little bit honey? Ya know, tell each other about each other, do you wanna tell everybody about yourself? Do you guys wanna ask Irene a question?
Nadiya: No.
Griffin: I feel like I probably know Irene, I have an aspect that is sort of Irene focused, unless you don’t want that, unless you want this to be the first time we met, but I'm just thinking she's in Human Resources, I’ve probably dealt with her at some point. Probably not—
Justin: [cross talk] She's met, I feel she's probably met everybody but on a pretty cursory basis—
Clint:: Yeah, you’ve only be here for like a day or two, so, you know about each other, you know about each other, Remy, because you’re information technology, and...
Griffin:[crosstalk] Okay, I’ve read their emails.
Travis: [Laughing]
Clint:: [Laughing] and you've been gathering information through the process, you guys have been through this really long detailed interview process, and screening process, to get vetted, so do you guys wanna share anything about each other?
Griffin: Yeah, so I look at Irene and say:
Remy: I’m actually relieved, because for a second there I thought you were actually asking us to say ‘grace’ before we ate dinner, which seems like an irresponsible thing for somebody in HR to do. Do you want a slider?
Griffin: And I motion to the pyramid, the slider pyramid, that I built on the table.
Irene: Uh, yeah, uh, what are— what—what kind are they?
Remy: Meat and... bun. But just take it from the top and not from the bottom ‘cause I don’t want it to fall over. Worked pretty hard on this.
Irene: Is the top one, is that okay?
Remy: Yeah, I didn’t touch it super a lot.
Irene: Oh— Okay, I’ll have the top one. Th-Thanks.
Justin: And she, and she does. Adding aspect “slider full.”
Clint:: [laughing]
Travis: Nadiya, during this, is scribbling out various formulae on napkins, some cocktail napkins.
Griffin: I look at Nadiya and I say—
Remy: You know it’s a party, right? I don’t think we have to be working right now.
Nadiya: Oh, no, this is— this is fun. I’m— I’m— It’s a thought experiment where I try to challenge myself to see if I can come up with a formula that I can’t solve. So far, not yet.
Justin: I just want to check on something— this is Justin now. [Travis: Uh huh] I just want to know sort of what the next few months of my life are going to be like. Are your guys character voices just not— just they’re— they’re just you guys? [crosstalk] Is that sort of what we’re doing?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Mine’s more of— mine’s kind of me, but like very positive.
Travis: Well here’s the thing, yeah, I—
Justin: Is this your way around the Justin McElroy character voice [crosstalk] sort of policing?
Travis: I was trying to come up with a character voice for Nadiya and I— I feel like it will find itself, you know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah, let’s not— let’s not sweat it.
Travis: [crosstalk] I don’t want to force it.
Clint:: And I’m doing twenty-two character voices [crosstalk] at least so...
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, tell me about it.
Justin: That’s great.
Griffin: I ask Nadiya to see if she can use math to help me with my burger pyramid. Maybe there’s some way that I can make it sort of more structurally sound, using some sort of formula.
Nadiya: You want— you want me to stop what I’m doing ... to help you figure out how to stack... your small burgers?
Remy: Burger pyramid. Yeah, they’re sliders. They call them sliders. There’s a name for it.
Nadiya: Okay. Maybe you could try eating one small burger at a time and leaving some... for everyone else?
Remy: Oh, no, I’m gonna wimpy down on pretty much all of these, but—
Clint:: [laughing]
Nadiya: Great. Great, great, great. I’m... gonna go back to my napkin now. Excuse me.
Irene: Nadiya, I— I— I hate to interrupt, I— I do want to mention just as long as we’re both here, um—
Nadiya: Yes, HR person?
Irene: I— I did still need the— your expense reports for your meals on the way in here.
Nadiya: [cross talk] Right, right, right.
Irene: I— I don’t know if you saw— I asked everybody to send those in as soon as you can. It’s— It’s no big deal— [crosstalk]
Nadiya: I’m sorry, I’m just— yeah. You know what, that one’s on me, you know, because I was working on lifesaving technology and science, but you know what, now that you mention it, it is important that I get you that Wendy’s receipt. Sooo, um… [crosstalk]
Remy: Hell yeah, Wendy’s! [crosstalk]
Nadiya: I— cool.
Clint:: [Laughing] At this point Joe speaks up:
Joe: Ah, listen there, Nadiya. This is a party, and everybody— starting tomorrow, you guys are gonna be pretty busy with your work and with the big changes in your life. So why don’t you just blow off a little steam and get to know each other, okay?
Remy: Love that— love that voice, dude, where ya from?
Joe: Fargo.
Justin: [Laughing]
Remy: Excellent, uh, Fargo, North Dakota.
Justin: [crosstalk] Dad got about three seconds into that before Travis typed in the chat “Aspect: Nadiya does not care for Joe.”
Joe: Well ya know nobody does like their boss. Nobody cares for their boss.
Justin: Like three syllables.
Clint:: Just then, “She Blinded Me With Science” is starting to end, it was a big choice too, put quite a few people on the dance floor.
Nadiya: Excuse me.
Travis: And Nadiya goes in to request it again.
Clint:: [Laughing] Well before it plays, “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” by Tears for Fears, requested by Martine, that shows up. After a few minutes of incredibly warm and bonding conversation, Hugh gets up. Where did I put Hugh...?
Travis: Is he the floating brain or the cat?
Clint:: No.
Justin: Diversity Inclusion.
Clint:: Yeah, Diversity Inclusion. [Travis: Okay] So, Hugh gets up and Hugh says:
Hugh: Uh, hi everybody, my name is Hugh. Welcome, [Travis: Hi, Hugh.] to our little get-together. It’s, uh, I’m happy to have you here now. I’m kinda introducing the next phase of our— our little program. Um, I’d like everybody, if you aren’t already at your tables, to please move to your— to your tables. Uh, and, uh, the other department heads are, uh, are bringing something to your tables, to your spot, the, uh, well I guess we’ll call them “Swag Bags.” Uh, these swag bags are, uh, [Griffin wheezes in laughter] are our gift to you. But they’re more than just gifts. They’re things that you’ll— you’re really going to, uh, to want to use.
Travis: There an iPod Touch in here?
Griffin: I didn’t know how bad I wanted to hear that voice say the word swag until you did it and now—
Clint:: [in Hugh’s voice] Swag bag.
Griffin: and now it’s changed—
Travis: Swag!
Hugh: And we welcome you to the Do-Good Fellowship here at the Berg. And, uh, we are based— I think you already know this from your own research, I know we’ve talked to ya— we are based on the old concept of The Junto that Ben Franklin started centuries ago. And every meeting of the Junto started with 24 questions, and, uh, those twenty-four questions are very important to how we operate here at the— the Do-Good Fellowship. So I think you all have copies of them. I’d like to share those questions with you. I’d like ya to each take a couple and read them out loud. And, so, um, so this is kinda of like our Pledge of Allegiance but we’ll do it, uh, separately. I’m gonna start with this table over here.
Clint:: And you hear these voices and they start to read twenty-four questions.
Voice: Have you met with any thing in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto, particularly in history, morality, poetry, physics, travels, mechanic arts, or other parts of knowledge? What news story have you lately heard agreeable for telling and conversation? Three! Have any citizen in your knowledge failed in his business lately? And what have you heard of the cause?
Justin: If you were to look over at Irene during this, you would note and you would look closely you would notice her mouthing the words. She’s like, deeply deeply into this.
Clint:: Well then— [crosstalk]
Griffin: I think— I think I—
Travis: I also! I also want you to know that uh, when number three is read “Has any citizen in your knowledge failed in his business lately?” Um, Nadiya is just like, staring at Remy.
Griffin: I did my best! I’m taking— I don’t notice cause I’m taking notes. Cause I really wanna ace this... test??
Clint:: Let’s start with your table. Irene, why don’t you start.
Irene: What unhappy effects of intemperance have you lately observed or heard? Of imprudence? Of passion? Or of any other vice or folly? Have you or any of your acquaintances been lately sick or wounded? If so, what remedies were used, and what were their effects?
Voice: Remy, would you take over please?
Irene: Oh can I— I’m sorry, can I do one more? Ten’s my—
Voice: Okay, do one more.
Irene: Ten’s my favorite. Who do you know that are shortly going on voyages or journeys if one should have occasion to send by them?
Voice: M’kay,Remy?
Remy: Yeah sure, uh, do you think anything at present in which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind, to their country, to their friends, or to themselves? Uh, hath any— Hath? When was this—? Okay, uh, hath any deserving stranger arrived in town since last meeting, that you heard of? And what have you heard or observed of his character or merits? and whether think you, it lies in the power of the Junto to oblige him, or encourage him as he deserves? Do you—
Justin: This is out of character. Listener, that was number twelve, we’re halfway there, baby. We told you it was gonna be rough going, we’re going to read this very— [Clint laughs] I thought something was gonna explode, honestly, I thought we were gonna get three questions in and then he was gonna be like [imitating Clint] And then Skeletor [crosstalk] was like fuck all of this!
Clint:: Alright, can we post this too?
Justin: Uh, the whole—
Griffin: Yeah, sure!
Justin: The whole list? Yeah.
Clint:: Post the whole list and then we’ll move on.
Justin: And then they did the rest of them and everyone was into it.
Travis: And then as the propellers spun, it cut to the end of the list, Nadiya reads number twenty four!
Nadiya: Do you see anything amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?
Clint:: Ooh! Good, I’m glad you skipped to that one.
Travis: Yeah.
Clint:: and this like the Kiwanis that they say the Kiwanis’ pledge, at the beginning of— of every— of every—
Griffin: Every meeting they stand there and they read these twenty four—
Justin: After reading this, how can they do this— [ Crosstalk]
Clint:: Well, the Kiwanis—
Travis: Now that the first hour and fifteen minutes has passed, we shall begin the meeting of the Junto.
Hugh: So, we’re gonna give a little bit more time to check out your uh, your Swag bags.
Clint:: So uh these swag bags are— It’s not— It’s not really fair to call them swag bags because they do have, uh, a purpose. They’re like, cylindrical, almost. Made of, uh, made of a kind of unusual fabric— like a duffel bag but you could wear it as a backpack or you can wear it as a duffel bag. And there’s a flap, and the flap has a triangular indentation on the front of it.
Travis: Um, I think there’s been some kind of mistake, cause my swag bag is just filled with koozies.
Clint:: No, you haven’t opened them yet.
Travis: Seventy koozies in here. [Clint laughs] Is that weird?
Clint:: You haven’t opened it yet.
Griffin: I have a, uh, I have a aspect which is just restless? So I think like I’m definitely into these questions and I definitely want to do a good job today. Uh, it’s very important to me that I do that. But like I am definitely opening that bag like while the last few questions are being read ‘cause I just can’t wait anymore.
Clint:: How did you open it?
Griffin: I popped open that triangular latch, I just started fiddlin’ with that-
Clint:: How did you-How did-How did you do that?
Griffin: With my ha- adult hand.
Clint:: No. Well you’re close.
Justin: Your tongue.
Griffin: With my tong-do you want me to french kiss the bag? I tried to french kiss the bag but it’s not--
Travis: Nadiya is just watching this
Justin: With your fingerprint!
Griffin: Okay I stick my thumb right in that opening.
Clint:: And it pops open.
Remy: Y’all just thumb it! Just thumb it right in there!
Clint:: Thumb it!
Nadiya: Yeah...
Clint:: You all do that. Inside these swag bags, the first thing you notice are these really cool vests. These are like utility vests in the fact that they’re-- the inside pockets and outside pockets these will hold all your electronics, your cell phones, your tablets, your anything else. Um and they’re like a dark charcoal gray and you notice that there’s another triangular indentation on the left breast of these vests.
Griffin: I put my fidget spinner in it and spin it. It doesn’t-[Justin chuckling under his breath] I don’t think anything happens there I don’t think that was the solution to the puzzle but I just wanted to establish Remy does have at least one fidget spinner.
Clint:: Inside the swag bag in addition to that are triangular badges that have the uh the twenty four mark question logo on it. But when you touch it, boom a picture of you pops up on the badge. It is triangular shaped--
Remy: Woah!!
Clint:: It is triangular shaped.
Griffin: Um I take the badge and I put it on the vest where the hole is?
Clint:: Yeah! And it kinda makes a little sound and more information about you pops up on the badge. Your name, uh your department, and your DH.
Griffin: Like Remy-wh-Remy loves gadgets and tech shit so much that this is-- this is w--this is wonderful for him. He is - he is, with childlike glee just opening all the pockets and-and touching all the things.
Travis: Nadiya doesn’t really wear badges. Uh--
Griffin: Well I had a-- I had a question, does Nadiya like know about this stuff ahead of time? Cause we’ve talked about it for a little bit that she’s in R&D which I don’t know if she knows what this bag and badge and--[ Clint: interrupts]
Clint:: Ssshe’s-- I don’t think she’s familiar with this technology but coming up, technology that she is familiar with. Also inside the bags are these like small pointers-pen lights but when you thumb the little bulb on it, you really can’t see any reactions so you kinda put those up--and a bag of Werther’s.
Justin: Nice!
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Really?
Clint:: Yeah I’m just looking for sponsorships.
Travis: Oh.
Clint:: By the way, Walk The Dinosaur by Was (Not Was) requested by Pridmore has shown up on the scroll.
Griffin: I look at--
Travis: Hell yeah.
Griffin: I look at Pridmore with a sneer. Not my favorite. Um--
Travis: Nadiya throws a thumbs up. That song rules.
Clint:: Hugh also mentions that when you activate the uh the vests with the badges, the fabric itself takes on almost like a protective armor kind of thing, it’s very it-it well I mean it’s not gonna stop a mortar or a-- but it might deflect a blade, it might deflect bullets, uh, something that might come in very handy, uh, when you guys start going on your missions. And so while you’re looking at the-the bags, uh, again there’s a little lull in, uh, what’s going on, uh, so Hugh says.
Hugh: Uh, we’ll let you look at your stuff and kinda share with each other and uh we’ll continue with our activities in uh in just a few minutes.
Clint:: So, what do you do?
Griffin: I look at everybody at my table and I say
Remy: Hey I gotta say this is starting to feel a little bit like a test? Kinda maybe a little bit? Anybody else kinda getting that vibe that--that maybe we should be on our best behavior right now?
Nadiya: Oh see, I was gonna say cult.
Remy: Oh. It’s not--
Griffin: I look at uh Potts, the IT lead and I like--
Remy: This isn’t-- It’s not a cult right? Cause I can’t- that doesn’t sound great.
Irene: Actually, the Do Good Foundation is a charitable organization that’s been working for, uh, a lot of years to make the world a better place. And uh ah- cult is-is not actually accurate.
Remy: Okay! I trust your-I trust your instincts.
Clint:: Potts says-
Potts: Listen, I uh I understand where you’re coming from. But no, it’s not a cult. We are--
Travis: [ Laughing loudly] Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay then fine! Alright!
Justin: That is- I will-I will point out that is what cults say [Laughs]
Justin: I think it’s written--
Travis: That is what a cult would say-- Oh it’s not!
Justin: Yeah very few cults are like- oh yeah it’s a cult. [Laughter]
Potts: Okay, we’re a cult.
Travis: Yeah, you got me.
Potts: We’re a big-ass cult.
Remy: Um Potts, is uh is this a test though? Cause I wanna- cause if it is, I wanna...do a good job, I just. I’m kinda nervous now.
Potts: Well, you know I think that everything in life is a test. I mean everything that you do you’re always being watched and- and you’re always being checked out to how you respond--not not in a judgemental way but just you know these-- even though we vetted you guys and-and screened you and interviewed you, you know there’s still you know a getting to know period. It’s not just you getting to know each other, it’s us getting to know you too.
Remy: So it is- it is a-it’s one-- it’s a test a little bit. Alright! That’s fine, ha ha ha, I got this.
Clint:: Just then, on the-on the scroll on the screen says The Dance by Garth Brooks requested by Grey.
Griffin: (Very dramatically) Greeeyy!
Justin: Killing me
Clint:: Grey loves country music you guys [A little crosstalk but it’s short]
Clint:: At this point, a new person stands up.
Justin: I will say also The Dance is a beautiful song that transcends genres so I think that they’re fine.
Clint:: And it is Garth Brooks.
Travis: I mean it’s no Thunder Rolls but it’s alright.
Justin: Callin’ Baton Rouge are you kidding me? [Travis makes a really weird noise]
Justin: Crank that.
Clint:: So Martine stands up--
Justin: Justin goes up and requests Callin’ Baton Rouge by Garth Brooks [Griffin laughs]
[Crosstalk]
Justin: I’m there.
Clint:: Justin is there to crash the party!
Clint:: Martine stands and introduces herself as Martine. She’s the head of security uh and she overheard Remy uh asking Potts if this is a test and she smiles. Uh you can tell that she uh she has a sense of humor about her. Uh she say that--
Martine: Uh we’ve designed a fun exercise so everyone can get to know each other.
Irene: Yaay!
Clint:: And she says-
Martine: Department heads?
Clint:: And all the department heads leave the tables uh--
Travis: Just quick question, is this mandatory?
Clint:: Yes it is.
Justin: Is it just the three of us in here? Or are there like--
Clint:: No, the other operatives are at the other tables.
Justin: There’s like what nine others? Is that right?
Clint:: Nine others. Right.
Justin: Okay.
Clint:: So as they’re leaving through one exit--there’s only one exit. As they’re leaving through the exit, Joe kinda looks back um over his-his shoulder and says--
Joe: Uh see you tomorrow you guys!
Clint:: As they leave Martine gets ready to leave and she says--
Martine: Here’s how the test works.
Griffin: Egg-spoon race, like fingers crossed like hunched over--
Remy: Egg-spoon race, egg-spoon race, god, I’ll crush a fucking egg-spoon race.
Martine: You have one goal and that’s--
Travis: Take the egg across the floor.
[Crosstalk]
Martine: To leave the room. All you have to do is, your table mates and you have to leave the room in the correct order.
Clint:: And the door is left opened as they walk out.
[The Taz Commitment Theme plays]
{31:55-37:45}[Commercial Break]
[Transition music - Taz Commitment Theme]
Clint:: Just then, the scroll at the bottom of the screen says “West Palm Beach Florida” by Coldplay.
Griffin: Oh god we’ve got to get out of this fucking room.
Clint:: Requested by blank.
Griffin: Well I don’t see any eggs or spoons so I think that we should probably try to figure out this puzzle. Um..
Justin: So is it the three of- is, like, three at a table is that what’s happening?
Clint:: There’s three people at each table. Yeah. Let me- let me you tell who’s at the tables. Table two-- you guys are table one even though you’re in the bottom right hand corner. Um at table two are Grey, Flanagan, and Addison. At table three Sylviane, Litti,and Jamie. And at four, Pridmore, Dagney, and Abbey.
Griffin: First of all, Coldplay doesn’t have a song- I’m- this is Remy-
Remy: Coldplay doesn’t have a song called West Palm Beach, and I’m not proud that I know [crosstalk] enough about Coldplay--
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Aww geek check!
Remy: Okay. Yeah that’s- that’s- I mean I’m more familiar with their older hits like Garden State soundtrack era shit but I’m pretty sure I’ve never heard a Coldplay song called West Palm Beach-- Am I getting cell service in here?
Clint:: No. There is no cellphone service.
Griffin: I try to- I try to get my cell phone out to like fact check that. But I-
Irene: Is anybody here… Is anybody here fr-
Justin: Oh yeah and Irene is sorta yelling as much as she does, um...
Irene: Uh, is anybody here from West Palm Beach? Out of curiosity?
Clint:: Mmm nope.
Remy: I’m not.
Nadiya: Nope. Okay first, did anybody here request the song “West Palm Beach, Florida” by Coldplay?
Remy: I would never request a Coldplay song, I know we just met but you should know that about me.
Nadiya: Okay, anybody? Did anybody request this song?
Clint:: It said “West Palm Beach Florida by Coldplay requested by…” [crosstalk] and there was blank
Griffin: [crosstalk] Blank.
Griffin: Yeah I think Jus-uh um uh Nadiya is just trying to make sure before we move on to any sort of other investigation. Um..West Palm Beach. Alright we have to leave this room in a certain order. I think we need to investigate like either the jukebox or the door-- or something. Cause I don’t think we have enough information to solve this right now.
Clint:: Okay, yeah! What are you going to investigate?
Travis: I am going [Dice noises] to investigate..
Justin: Now Travis you’re making dice noises are you gonna... do...
Travis: Oh yeah! We’ve got the thing and the thing. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: I wanted to have the-- maybe there are people who only listen to this show to get like dice sound ASMR Justin, you don’t know.
Justin: They can edit it-- they can edit in their own.
Travis: Okay. I want to investigate the high-tech jukebox. How about that?
Clint:: Go for it!
Griffin: That’s not good?
Travis: No that ain’t great, but I add +3
Justin: And Travis rolled a -1, we do need to say these things.
Travis: Yeah I rolled a - 1, +3 is a 2.
Clint:: Okay! When you go over to the high tech jukebox, you notice that the song “West Palm Beach, Florida” by Coldplay is not in its database.
Griffin: [mumbling under his breath] It doesn’t exist... [then clear voice] What are we hearing? Like what are- what- are we hearing like an original Coldplay composition that they wrote specifically for this test?
Clint:: It’s just kind of a generic song that would sound kinda like--
Griffin: You’re describing a Coldplay song. (pause)
(Justin snickering)
Clint:: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay, okay.
Clint:: So that’s it, it’s some kinda Coldplay-ish music.
Griffin: I wanna roll Notice just for the room, just to see like--this is basically perception check right? So this will be like uh-
Clint:: Okay. (Dice roll)
Griffin: Jesus Christ, that’s 0. So everything looks good to me! I didn’t- I- I’m still looking for spoons and eggs over here so um--
Clint:: But you know what, even a 0 I think I will give you one.
Griffin: Okay!
Clint:: You notice that, uh at table two Addison is really taking a long hard look at the penlight pointer. [Justin: Hm.] in his hand.
Remy: Uh, Addison did you figure something out? What’s the- I don’t know if we’re suppose to be sharing information right now but what’s up with your...what’s up with your pen?
Addison: Uhh I’m not really open with sharing the information with you but uh, you know the fact that they would give us a light… And if you look at the--the little bulb thing, it does light up it just doesn’t shoot a beam of light that I can see.
Justin: Uh Irene takes out her penlight she’s got, it’s the inverse of Kardala so her investigation is a +2 and let me get that quick roll going. Uh...
Griffin: Would love a good roll. Nope? Still no that’s a 0.
Justin: No, it’s a 2 though, which in the ladder of Fate is fair. Um… She uh takes out her penlight and does a Notice check um around the room just to see if the light coming out of it has any effect anywhere in the room.
Clint:: And you notice that when you just kinda flash it around the room, it- it seems like there was a flash when you pointed it at Nadiya.
Justin: Weird. Okay I point it at her again.
Griffin: I try- I also- I am now also try [sic] quartering Nadiya with my pen, just to see if it also flashes.
Travis: And I’m kinda scanning myself with it.
Clint:: That’s--that’s good.
Justin: Okay…
Travis: Palm! At the palm!
Griffin: You gotta shoot it at her beach… I mean her palm [someone laughs]- shoot it at her west palm, your left hand palm I guess?
Clint:: You shoot it at your palm, and you see the number 582.
Griffin: Alright so she has to leave the room five hundred and eighty second- There’s not--
Clint:: But when you shine it on your own palms...nothing.
Justin: (mumbling) 582
Clint:: Just then! [Travis: Wah!] The scroll, the scroll on the bottom of the screen says “Walking On Sunshine” and it starts playing.
Justin: Uh Irene checks her feet with the light.
Clint:: Nothing.
Griffin: I check my feet with the light?
Clint:: Nope.
Remy: I’m sorry Nadiya, I think it’s just you got stuff written all--you remember someone writing five-eighty-two on your hand?
Nadiya: Man I don’t know.
Remy: Alright super helpful.
Travis: Uh, Nadiya checks her feet I guess.
Clint:: Nothing.
Griffin: M’kay.
Clint:: Now you’ve got--remember there are three of you and there are three other tables.
Irene: Addison did you uh have you figured anything else out? Cause I would- I would really love the help and I wanna make sure that uh that uh... that we can all sorta work together as a team that’s really important to me. So maybe you can kinda share something, then I can share something.
Remy: Yeah we’ve gotta cool--we’ve got a number. It’s got three digits, so that’s three clues basically.
Justin: I’m going to use Empathy to try to [Clint:: Good.] uh convince him um--
Griffin: Well that would be Rapport probably right? Empathy is like if you were trying to tell if someone was lying to you or figuring out their emotional state.
Justin: Okay yes Rapport. Which she has a +3 on Rapport, so. (Dice Roll)
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Oh hell yeah!
Justin: [Crosstalk] Oh! Hell yeah that’s a 3.
Clint: Aw really good.
Justin: That’s a 3 [Travis: +3] plus... +3, so 6, which in the Fate system is fantastic Rapport.
Clint:: That’s fantastic.
Addison: Well yeah let me tell you-
Travis: I feel like I’ve known you my whole life!
Addison: You’re friendly and you know I- I like everybody! I try to get along with just about everybody and hey great googa mooga you are… the- the- one of the nicest people at this party so let me tell you this--
Irene: Thanks
Addison:one we-we saw you guys shining it on the palms, so we shined it on our palms and Flanagan... Flanagan was the only one with a marking on her hand--on her palm. It was a 0.
Griffin: Hmm.
Nadiya: Okay wait, so everybody at the tables, raise your hand if somebody at your table had something written on their hand when you shined the penlight on it and if you haven’t tried it yet, try it now.
Clint:: And table three starts to respond, but Jamie at table three makes them stop. And Jamie says---
Travis: I’m going to intimidate the shit out of Jamie.
Jamie: Guys don’t-don’t tell ’em anything. Don’t tell ’em anything. This is a competition and I wanna win it.
Travis: I get uh 2- well, so I rolled equal to 0 +2 to intimidate… to intimidate Jamie.
Clint:: Okay.
Justin: In the Fate system, 2 is fair.
Clint:: So Jamie says, um--
Jamie: Why in the world would we want to help you beat us…. fucker.
Griffin: W-woah! [Justin: Shit!] I don’t like hearing my dad say that.
Clint:: Yeah, I- Your dad didn’t. Jamie did.
Griffin: Uh I look at-- I look at uh-- [Crosstalk]
Clint:: And she- She reaches out and gives you a shove [Travis: Woooooah!] Nadiya.
Remy: Hey Irene, you’re in HR right? You’re seeing all of this? Just checking...
Nadiya: No I- I got this.
Irene: Yeah I--
Nadiya: Jamie I would like you to look around this room. Right? See everybody, look everybody in the eyeballs. All of you together do not equal my mind. So you can either help me now, and I will help you in the future. Or I will work and use every bit of my mind to ruin your time here.
Jamie: That works.
Griffin: Oh by the way the whole time this conversation is happening, fucking Walking on Sunshine is playing and that is so good to me. That’s a very good scene this happening right now.
Clint:: Jamie holds up her palm. You shine your light on her palm and it says 467.
Griffin: Okay so these are all distinct numbers. Um can I check the jukebox and see if somebody requested Walking on Sunshine?
Clint:: You sure can. [Griffin: I do--] Martine did.
Griffin: Martine--Martine’s not here though right?
Clint:: That’s right.
Griffin: Hm.
Justin: Oh wait! [Griffin mumbling out the words to Walking on Sunshine.] We’re still missing one number right? Four tables with three people?
Nadiya: Third--Fourth table!
Clint:: So the information-the information to be-- let me be fair, the information that came up when you checked the jukebox said Walking on Sunshine by blank requested by Martine.
Nadiya: It’s Katrina and the Waves.
Travis: Don’t ask how Nadiya knows that.
Griffin: Um we all know a lot of things that we shouldn’t. Yeah we walk over to the other table or I walk over to the other table and say--
Remy: Uh do one of you have numbers on your palm that shows up when you shine the light on it? We have someone--We’re happy to share it. Maybe we can wo-work together, I watch a lot of Survivor and it seems to help when you, you know cooperate with the enemy a little bit so what- what do you say?
Clint:: Pridmore speaks up and Pridmore says--
Pridmore: Listen I really need this job.[Justin: Hell yeah] I really need to do well here and anything I can do to curry favor with the people here in the Fellowship, I’m gonna do-- so it just doesn’t seem like--to make a lot of sense to me to give up our information quite so easily. what uh what can you-what can you offer me?
Griffin: Um, I reach into my wallet-
Remy: I have like thirteen dollars. I have a library card, a Gamestop membership. Um…
Pridmore: Wait! Hold on hold on just one little second. Is that an Olive Garden card in there?
Remy: Uh yeah. It’s not the Pasta Pass but I think it has like twelve bucks on it. Uh so that’s probably enough for some Fettuccine. What do you say?
Pridmore: Tell ya what, give me the cash and give me the card and we’ll share our number with you.
Remy: Really cleaning me out here.
Griffin: Of course I hand it over, it’s nothing!
Clint:: Okay [Justin laughs] Well--[ Griffin: It’s garbage!] she loves pasta.
Griffin: Okay.
Pridmore: Okay, show them, Abbey.
Clint:: So Abbey--it’s Abbey like Downton Abbey, [Griffin: Okay!] Abbey holds up his hand, you shine the light on it and it’s 602.
Justin: What? Dam- well- okay wait a minute wu-wu-wu-is it.. Uh this is nothing nevermind. Are the numbers on--[Griffin: No!] Are the numbers on -- are the songs on the jukebox numbered?
Clint:: No.
Justin: Damn that would have been dope. I--
Clint:: Just then, the scroll on the middle screen shows Color my world by Chicago requested by Josie.
Griffin: Alright we’re getting back on track. Um, alright, Josie’s the engineering head…
Remy: Uh Pridmore, this song have any sort of significance to you? Or Josie?
Pridmore: I uh- it doesn’t make any sense to me.
Remy: M’kay.
Pridmore: I love the song.
Remy: No Chicago’s a great band--
Pridmore: Color my wooorld [crosstalk] with loove!
Remy: uh.. Oh the map! The map with all the different color coded areas on-on it right? Maybe that’s anything..
Justin: S-Shine it on- Shine--
Irene: Shine your light on that maybe--
Remy: Okay.
Irene: Maybe something will happen.
Griffin: Okay I shine my light on the map of the Berg.
Clint::When you shine your light on the map of the Berg, all of a sudden it goes back to the main section. It goes back to the main map showing all of the different departments and the colors as I said, are color coded and each department has their own color.
Travis: Cool!
Griffin: Okay. What is uh, can you tell us IT, Humanities, and R&D color?
Clint:: Sure! IT’s color is amethyst which is a blue violet. Uh R&D’s color is yellow, which is 582. And Humanities is violet- 403.
Griffin: Was there a number for amethyst? You didn’t tell us that.
Clint:: Amethyst is 439.
Griffin: Okay so we have some num-we have 582 right? And that was-was that the number that we started with?
Travis: Yeah so I’m 582...
Griffin: Wait why do the colors have numbers? [Crosstalk]
Justin: Okay you’re telling us this information
Clint:: All of a sudden, Walking on Sunshine plays again.
Griffin & Justin: Okay.
Griffin: But wait wait wait--
Justin: You’re telling this info-okay.
Travis: Aaah it’s the wavelengths of the visible spectrum. That’s what the colors are so 0 is black um [Justin: Okay.] and then as we go through, it’s uh violet is 380 or yeah 380 to 450. Blue is 450 to 495, Green is 495 to 570… Yellow is--
Clint:: All of a sudden, table two stands up and starts moving towards the door.
Griffin: Well stop stop stop! Don’t--
Justin: Fuck it-
Irene: Let’s just go- let’s just go in order. Me uh-
Nadiya: Yep go.
Irene: Me, Remy--
Remy: Alright.
Irene: Me, Remy and--
Clint:: Grey, Flanagan and Addison break into a run.
Griffin: Yeah we’re running too! Can I roll athletics? I’m super fast.
Justin: But you can’t go first. [ Griffin: I know] I have to go first.
Clint::Well you’re closer to the door.
Travis: Okay we’re running.
Griffin: Alright we--
Justin: We’re running.
Griffin: We-We sprint through it, Irene, me, Nadiya.
Clint:: You have solved the color puzzle.
Justin and Griffin: Yaaaay!
Griffin: I do a flip through the door as I go cause that’s how I- That’s who I am.
Travis: And uh Nadiya flips off uh the other team.
Clint:: As you come out, Joe and Potts and Grace are there and Joe says--
Joe: I knew you guys would be the first three to do it. I knew
Nadiya: Shut up, Joe.
Joe: you’d win!
Nadiya: Joe shut up.
Remy: Thank you, Joe. That means a lot.
Justin: Irene turns to the people coming through the door now-
Irene: Hey guys that was so much fun, thank you! We’ll get--You- You all will get’em next time we- we just barely made it. Wasn’t that fun though? It seemed really fun!
Clint:: And Sylviane just looks at you like he could stab you in the head.
Griffin: Your vest won’t protect against that so be careful.
Clint:: Potts says--
Potts: Alright listen you guys, that was awesome. We’re very proud of you but as you know, you have a very big day tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day we do the augmentation so… go to your rooms.
Justin: Woah! Woah. I don’t see Potts on my guest list, what does Potts do?
Griffin: He’s IT head. He’s my-[crosstalk]
Clint:: Remy’s boss.
Remy: Hey Potts can you uh back up and start over and particularly focus on sorta the augmentation part of it this time around. Am I gonna get a.. third maybe a fourth leg-What’s -- what are we talking about? Blasters in the chest-what are you--what do you--Hey Potts, what are you talking about man?
Potts: You know what? You guys have had a lot thrown at you today. Bright and early tomorrow morning the-the prep crew--
Remy: You can’t--Potts! You just! You can’t just mention body augmentation and then walk it back, Potts!
Potts: Well we’ll tell you about it in the morning. We’ll have a big debriefing tomorrow morning-a big breakfast debriefing so be thinking about what you wanna eat! And we’ll talk about it and we’ll- we’ll give you the waivers. This is totally your choice. We’ll talk about it in the morning okay?
Nadiya: So it’s not a cult? Wait it’s not a cult?
Remy: I don’t think it’s a cult. I think we’re probably good on that front. Is it…Potts! On the scale of ear piercing to second head attachment, where are landing vis-à-vis augmentation, I’d hate to get hung up on this.
Potts: Let’s say seventy-five percent more towards the head thing.
Remy: Oh my god…
Potts: But I’m telling you, it is going to transform your life. It is absolutely amazing what’s gonna happen to you.
Nadiya: Okay so just one last time-not a cult.
Potts: Not a cult.
Nadiya: Okay.
Potts: It-It might be cult-ish.
Nadiya: Alright, cult-adjacent.
Remy:Uh one last question, can we go back into the room now that we’ve just solved the test?
Potts: Yeah! Are you still hungry?
Griffin: I go get my pyramid of burgers.
Remy: Imma finish these in my room, I’ll see you guys tomorrow!
Irene: Alright get some sleep.
Remy: I’m not gonna be sleeping great after eating twenty sliders but we’ll see about that.
Clint:: Okay um next morning rolls around. You go to a uh-one of the private dining rooms um in the section um--matter of fact, uh each one of the wings has their own private dining rooms and for right now you’re in Humanities. Remember Humanity in the Do Good Fellowship also includes medical so your three department heads are actually all three there. You sit down at a table, they can give you chairs this time, and you’re having a breakfast. And so uh Joe and Potts and uh Grace are talking to you. And uh Joe starts off cause he’s the head of R&D and he says--
Joe: Alright I know you-you folks have a lot of questions about the process. Um and I-I wanna tell you about it. It’s called the STEM Plant Process. STEM plants are these very tiny molecular bonds that we introduce into your system. And the STEM plants automatically go to places in your body to emphasize whether it’s mental, whether it’s physical, whatever it is that um act as little tiny bio-organic um enhancers. Uh the process-we have a really good idea how it works uh and ironically uh it’s-it’s based on research that Nadiya here has done. Nadiya uh tell’ em a little about your- the research that you do-- that you do with the uh the artificial uh skin.
Nadiya: Yeah, um, so basically what I’ve created is a kind of smart biopolymer. Um it acts uh- where you would normally need skin from a donor. Um it acts as both the skin and a bandage. It um-- it mimics human skin, it grows, it changes, it heals...and over time bonds with-with the person who receives it um and becomes part of their body. It’s basically amazing and a miracle and I did it and you’re all welcome.
Griffin: I rai--Remy raises his hand and waits.
Joe: Yes! Yes--
Nadiya: Yeah..yeah Remy?
Joe: Yeah Remy?
Remy: I-I think I’m good on skin. I appreciate the offer but like I have plenty of skin already and I don’t need extra skin. Where would it go even I guess is my first question --on top of the skin that’s already there? Or would it just kinda dangle off? Cause that’s I--
Clint:: Now this--and this is where Grace steps in and she says um--
Grace: The technology that we use, almost introduces you into a “cocoon” that sorta covers your entire body.
Remy: Skin cocoon?
Grace: And it-well now wait-you emerge from the cocoon after the STEM plants are injected into you. So that’s-- you’re not gonna have extra skin hanging off of ya like a big goiter or something uh it’s just the way that we get the STEM plants into your system. There’s no pain involved whatsoever.
Nadiya: Can we please stop talking about my miracle creation like it’s a gross skin thing? Like it’s--
Remy: No It’s--it’s good skin.
Nadiya: It’s like plastic or silly putty or-or some kind of--it’s- it’s-it’s not skiiin…
Remy: Yeah I guess--I guess I’m confused are we-- are we talking about steroids here? Cause I’m-I don’t think I wanna do that. I don’t wanna get DQ from the next qualifier. It’s not steroids right?
Clint:: And Potts says- Potts says--
Potts: Well I gotta tell you-you are gonna be permanently changed. This is not a reversible process and that’s why we have to make sure that all three of you want to go through this process. There’s something else you need to know about the process. Once it’s established, with these STEM plants and once you three have gained these abilities, these abilities only work in these three parts. In other words, the three of you have to be within a hundred yards of each other for these abilities to function.
Nadiya: Is that mandatory?
Potts: I think I’m gonna be telling you that everything’s mandatory from this point on. In other words you three have to function within that proximity of each other for your abilities to work.
Travis: Um I am actually going to a--what’s it called when you make yourself do something? A--
Griffin: Compel?
Travis: Yeah! I’m gonna do a Compel on myself, one of my aspects is Remy needs to be pushed. Um and I’m going to do that now and turn to Remy and say--
Nadiya: Don’t be a coward. There’s no jumps in technology without risks.
Travis: And Nadiya rolls up her sleeves and shows a patch of this smart polymer she tested on herself.
Nadiya: When I couldn’t get approval to test this on humans, I did it myself, and now I’m in the running for the Nobel Prize. Sooo--
Remy: Yeah I kn--
Nadiya: Don’t be scared-
Remy: I’m not--
Nadiya: and try it.
Remy: I’m not scared. I mean, you--earlier I think someone said the term skin cocoon and I- that’s gonna be sort of rattling around my cage for a while but um... I-- just to be-- I need to clarify something real quick--Hey Potts?
Potts: Mm-hm?
Remy: Are you about to give us superpowers?
[Music fades in]
Potts: Remy, Irene, Nadiya. We are about to make you gods.

[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Commitment Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Clint: Welcome back! I am Clint McElroy, your uhh, DM. Your GM. Which is it? GM?
Justin: GM.
Clint: I’m your M. And uh, this is–
Griffin: You’re my – You’re just my Master? That’s no good.
Travis: Nooooo.
Clint: [crosstalk] I am the master!
Justin: [crosstalk] Game master.
Clint: Are you ready to play? Are you ready to jump in on this?
Justin: Hellllll yeah I am, Dad. I’m clipping, though, so let me fix that.
Griffin: He’s not ready to play, ‘cause he’s clipping.
Justin: Okay, now I’m not clipping, and I’m ready to play.
Clint: Alright!
Travis: I was thinking about— and we’ve never done this before but I was thinking about— we should start this episode like this:
Nadiya: Wait, you’re going to make us gods?
Travis: Right, so then it, like, picks up—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, picks right up, people love that shit.
Justin: I’ve never done that.
Travis: I’m gonna work real hard, by the way to try to come up with a character voice. We’re gonna see how I do.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: I actually– this is like a really super weird coincidence, but I looked it up, and I did a lot of research on it, and it turns out that Remy sounds exactly like I do. [Justin: It’s just so…] It’s like really, very very strange.
Justin: It’s just so difficult to tell when it’s you and when it’s Remy. [Griffin: Well, if I–] It’s a challenge–
Griffin: Well, if I talk about jumping very high or being on Ninja Warrior, you can assume that that is me embodying Remy, in that moment.
Justin: That’s fine.
Griffin: Because I’ve never been on Ninja Warrior and my jumps are pathetic.
Justin: What– what–
Clint: And if you talk about spilling coffee on your computer, we’ll know it’s you, Griffin.
Griffin: Oh my god, it’s everywhere. It got in every hole. Every crack, every plug, every crevice.
Travis: But tell us about what got on the computer. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: Jesus.
Justin: Okay, um. Uh, so let’s do like a smash cut okay? I’ll just kick it off okay, smash cut.
{2:17}
Irene: You’re going to make us Todds?
[Travis laughs]
Potts: No, gods. Gods. With a capital G.
Remy: That’s good. I– I’m not sure if I wanna be a god, but I definitely don’t want to be a Todd.
Potts: This is really not a metaphysical discussion. It’s more along the lines of abilities and powers.
Remy: You were speaking florally. Like, you’re gonna make us super powerful. Not that you’re gonna make us live on a big mountain in the sky. Or… maybe down under the earth, or…
Nadiya: I mean, you could– you could have just said that.
Remy: It was a cool way to button up the conversation, I think.
Nadiya: I mean, yes. No, definitely.
Potts: And it obviously failed.
Nadiya: Well, I mean it— listen, it made an impact, we’re talking about it, aren’t we? But, maybe next time just say ‘I’m going to perform experiments on you to try to make you more powerful than you are’.
Justin: That’s not a very good end of a podcast episode though, to be honest. [various murmurs of agreement]
Griffin: Remy stands there kinda quietly and contemplatively for a while, and he says
Remy: Alright, uh. Heat vision then. I guess.
Irene: Yeah, heat vision for me too.
Nadiya: Do we— do we get to pick, because I would like to be invisible, please.
Potts: Uh, no, not really. Uh, it’s kind of a crapshoot. We haven’t done this too many times. I– It’ll all make sense to you tomorrow morning.
Travis: [timeskip noise]
[laughter]
Griffin: Didn’t we just do this–
Clint: It’s tomorrow morning.
Griffin: Okay. [laughter]
Clint: You are in the medical wing of the Humanities division of the ‘Berg.
Travis: Well, are we? Because according to the Roll20 map I’m looking at we are trapped in some kind of demonic hellscape that is Dad’s imagination.
Griffin [crosstalk]: Holy god, Dad is— I’m looking at this map and, again, Justin’s gonna post hopefully all these to the twitter account.
Justin: I don’t even think I could get how good it is [Griffin: Yeah.] in a screenshot.
Griffin: I think Dad might be—
Justin: Can you zoom out so you can get, like, the full scope—
Griffin [crosstalk]: Yeah yeah, there’s a [Justin: Aww, there we go.] slider there—
Justin [crosstalk]: Okay, okay.
Griffin [crosstalk]: So capture the whole thing–
Griffin: Because it’s important, because these are clues ‘cause I think our dad’s the fucking Zodiac Killer.
Travis: Uh huh, uh huh. [Justin cracks up]
Justin: I need to make— okay, I can’t make the little icons smaller. I’ll try to get as much of the good stuff as I can, ‘cause it’s like…it’s all so buck–wild.
Griffin: There’s some, I think, objects from Half–Life in here, there’s a—
Travis: My favorite is, to really sell the ‘it’s a science room’; there’s just a periodic table of elements. Uh, just hanging around.
Justin: I like–
Clint: That’s a character!
Travis: Oh! Justin [crosstalk]: It’s a char– that’s a character.
Griffin: It’s– It’s–
Justin: It’s me, Perdy! [pronounced peer–dee]
Griffin: It’s Table–O. [laughter]
Clint: No! That’s Joe, your buddy Joe, remember?
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: [as Joe] My name is Joe, I’m a periodic table of elements that came to life.
Clint: [crosstalk]: He’s a scientist!
Justin: I’m a scien– well, of course!
Travis: A witch kissed me and trapped me in this table of elements!
Justin: If the periodic table of elements did come to life, it would be a scientist. I think we can all agree on that.
Griffin: [as Joe] I wanna teach you kids all about the noble gases.
Griffin: Um, alright, so... sorry.
{5:35}
Clint: You step into the installation…installation. Um, this room is bisected into two halves with, uh— by a large thick transparent wall. On the left side is like a big pumping device, and Grace is standing there prepping that machine. On the right side are these large tanks. Joe, or the periodical table, is standing there prepping it. In the middle of the wall is a large, impressive–looking metallic door. But the room that you’re in when you first walk in is kind of dominated, there’s a circular table right in the middle of the room, on this half of the room.
Travis: And is that also a character? Are all tables characters, or just some of them?
Clint: No, no. But the computer bank…standing there is Potts.
Griffin: See? Your [laughter] your iconography, the rules of it are so– I don’t know what is object and what is person. But I love it.
Clint: Well, Potts is over IT—
Griffin: I gotcha, I gotcha.
Justin: So he’s a computer?
Griffin: I would know that keyboard anywhere.
Clint: So as you step in, Joe greets you
Joe: Alright, uhh. Hey guys, welcome to the big day. How’s everybody feeling?
Irene: A little nervous, if I’m gonna be honest.
Remy: Yeah, me too, not about the science, but that I’ll get, y’know, a lame power like, you know gettin…gettin real small or…you know, super–tasting or something like that.
Nadiya: I’m fine.
Joe: Well that’s good there. Okay, so um, first thing you do is, uh, take off your robes. And, uh, hang them on those pegs over there, and we’ll get started.
Clint: Now it’s totally up to you guys. Uh, you can either be naked under the robes or you can have on, like, little Speedo things.
Griffin: Uhhhhh okay.
Justin: O–kay.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Kind of a…weird energy.
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m gonna go with not naked. Not naked, thank you very much.
Justin: Yeah, not naked, kind of a weird vibe–
Griffin: Kind of a weird vibe, that you’ve just told us to dress to our comfort, Dad. [Clint: Yeah, that’s it.] Still your sons, I know you’re having fun in your fantasy world but—
Clint: It’s just like the spa. Dress down to your own comfort.
Travis: Except not. It’s like if you walked into work, and the boss was like “Okay, cool. Do you want to be naked or what?” [chuckle]
Griffin: Um, yeah, I’ll just wear my underwear, thank you.
Travis: Yeah.
Clint: Okay. So you, uh, they open the great big impressive metallic hatch and you step into the other half of the room.
Nadiya: This is a very impressive metallic hatch.
Clint: It’s from Ikea.
Griffin: We love our big metallic hatches here on the Adventure Zone.
Clint: Uh, over on the left side there are machines on the corresponding sides of the big clear wall. There’s some intake fans and…what else, outgive fans? What’s the opposite of intake?
Griffin: Output?
Justin: Outtake?
Griffin: Output?
Clint: Okay, they got outtake fans in front of the pumping thing on the other side of the—
Travis: No, outtake fans are the people who watch America’s Funniest Home Videos. [laughter]
Justin: Woof. [Griffin: Yipes.] Woof.
Clint: And there are great big cylinders on the other side of the machine where Joe had been. But the room is dominated by three pads, three circular pads on the floor that look like they’re like covered with a kind of mesh, a very fine mesh. And over each one of those pads is an array of metallic arms with a nozzle at the end of each one. And that is directly over those pads. Um, Grace hands you a, uh, kind of skullcap thing to place over your heads, and there are earbuds in the skullcap. Also, a pair of goggles each and a respirator with a built in microphone.
Griffin: I ask Grace
Remy: So is it like standard protocol, like, we have to get a spray tan before we get the superpowers or? [Travis laughing]
Grace: It’s very similar. I think you’re going to find it a very pleasurable experience actually.
Nadiya: Weird.
Remy: You've modelled the superpower injection process after spray tanning. Like we’re on Toddlers and Tiaras? Just, just making sure this is good science.
Grace: It’s exactly good science, trust me, it’s very good science. When you’re ready, when you’ve got the skullcaps on, the goggles on, the respirator – um, step up on those pads.
Travis: Nadiya's already done, Nadiya’s already on there, skullcap, all of it.
Grace: Remy, you’re on the pad on the left. Nadiya, you’re on the pad on the right. Irene, you’re on the pad in the middle.
Irene: Okay.
Travis: [horrible strained grunting sound]
Remy: Do the pads correspond to different superpowers, because is there a heat vision pad?
Grace: Um, there is not specifically a heat vision pad.
Remy: Okay…
Grace: But they are calibrated to your own individual biology, so I’m afraid it is that order that you have to do that–
Nadiya: Cool. Let’s go, let’s go, I’ve got work to do. Come on.
Grace: Alright now, we’re going to need a minute or two to calibrate, so why don’t you three just, uh. Take a moment to gather your thoughts. Maybe share a little bit, talk to each other, and we’ll get started here in just a minute.
Clint: And then Grace steps through the metal portal, and closes it behind her.
Irene: Okay, everybody, top… movie. Is that good? Top– top movie?
Remy: Top movie, like my f– my favorite movie?
Irene: Top movie, yeah, like number one.
Travis: Nadiya points to the headphones and the respirator and kinda shrugs like, mm, sorry.
[Clint laughing]
Irene: Uh– [shouting] Nadiya. Nadiya?
Nadiya: [‘can’t hear you’ noises]
Irene: Favorite movie?
Travis: Mm, points at the headphones, mm, ahh.
Irene: Alright, I’m going to pick a movie for Nadiya. Um… [clicks] Let’s see...
Remy: Oh, Flubber.
Irene: Flubber. She loves science, Flubber.
Travis: Nadiya’s eyes narrow. [Clint wheezes]
Irene: Is your favorite movie Flubber, Nadiya? It’s probably Flubber.
Remy: It’s probably Flubber.
Irene: [crosstalk] Or the Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.
Remy: [crosstalk] Nadiya, hey, Nadiya, don’t say anything if it’s Flubber or the Nutty Professor II: The Klumps. Just stay completely silent.
Travis: Nadiya’s kinda shaking. [chuckles]
Remy: Okay. Alright.
Irene: So she picked Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.
Nadiya: It’s— it’s The Fly! It’s The Fly.
Remy: Ohhhh, shit.
Nadiya: It’s the Fly.
Irene: Ohhh, should’ve guessed that. What about you?
Remy: Uh, it’s actually Flubber, which is weird, I, I—
Irene: That is so strange.
[Clint laughs]
Remy: It’s just— it’s a lot of fun and uh, you know, there’s a lot of very high jumping, I was a kid and I watched, you know, Rob Williams jump real high with the Flubber on his shoes and I was like ‘hey, that looks pretty good’. It was actually what inspired me to become a, you know, a good jumper so. I owe a lot to that film. What about you, Irene?
Irene: Me? Royal Tenenbaums. Natch.
Remy: Okay. Yeah, that’s one of the better ones.
Irene: Of the movies, you mean?
Remy: [amused] Yeah.
Irene: Yeah, of the movies, I think it’s probably one of the better ones.
Clint: Okay, your earbuds crackle and you hear the voice—
Travis and Griffin: Ahh! [Griffin laughs]
Potts: Okay, gang, we’re getting ready. Now let me just explain to you what’s gonna happen so you don’t completely freak out. Moderate freaking out is okay. Those nozzles up above you are going to spray what we call Skinthetic, which is a version of Nadiya’s artificial skin.
Nadiya: Okay, see you in court, go on.
Potts: No, actually, it was part of your agreement if you noticed, you signed it away.
Nadiya: Ah.
Potts: Um, and it will spray the Skinthetic in an aerosol form, and it will cover you and harden. Um, heh.
Remy: [angry, suspicious humming]
Potts: Space Cadet used to call them your golems, ‘cause they sorta make you look like, kinda, rough–carved–
Clint: And then Joe’s voice cuts in and says,
Joe: Uh, not now. Uh, we need to hear it from them. We need to keep the chatter off the, uh, off the line.
Remy: You did just say, just real quick, that it wasn’t gonna be a— specifically not gonna be a skin cocoon… situation? And I’m— it sounds like you’re maybe going back on that deal, maybe you’ve changed your mind about some stuff.
Joe: Oh, it’s a skin cocoon.
Remy: Okay. Fantastic.
Joe: We just— we talked it over with HR, and Irene and her cohorts agreed that it was better that you not just completely wig out.
Remy: Cool cool cool.
{{Travis|Nadiya: It’s all about branding, you know what I mean. [
{{Griffin|Remy: Sure.] It’s like, they’re not gonna call it “skin cocoon”, call it [
Remy: Alright.] Skinthetics, or whatever.
Remy: This, this–
{13:54}
Clint: So the Skinthetics start to spray out of the nozzles.
Remy: I'm a hungry lil’ caterpillar, let's do it!
Clint: And it's covering you all. And so Potts says,
Potts: Alright, everybody doin' okay? Tell me what's going through your heads while this is happenin'.
Nadiya: I'm just thinking of all the work I'm going to do as like, super smart… some kind of like, Mega Scientist, I guess?
Remy: I– I– this is super yucky, and also my eyes don't feel hot at all, and I'm pretty bummed about that.
Potts: Irene?
Irene: I'm really scared.
Potts: Okay. Well, you're doin' fine, just keep breathin' in your respirator, just keep talkin' to me. Um, and uh, you'll probably notice some changes in the consistency. You've got your arms extended, you look just like, uh, Sam in Quantum Leap. Your arms are extended to give the Skinthetic total access.
Remy: I– I gotta–
Nadiya: Is the Skinthetic supposed to smell like cinnamon rolls, or…?
Potts: No, that's your own breath comin' through the respirator.
Nadiya: Oh!
Potts: Yeah so—
Nadiya: I did have cinnamon rolls.
{15:06}
Remy: I have a–
Potts: Breakfast mystery solved.
Remy: I have an itch on my tummy! And I can’t do nothin’ about it, please! Please. Can someone get in here and help me out?
Clint: It– so the golems around you have hardened, and it’s just kind of a waiting game. Again, Potts chimes in
Potts: Alright, tell me how you’re feeling. Irene, are you still nervous?
Irene: …yeah? [snickers]
Potts: Okay. Well, what’s gonna happen is–
Irene: What exactly in the past five minutes do you think would have dispelled my fears?
Potts: Well, it’s about to get worse. At this point, we activate the pumps.
Clint: When they activate the pumps, the stimplants fill the chamber, in the air. And are immediately attracted to your golems and start working their way into the actual Skinthetics and– think of it as, like, a medium. The stimplants enter your [Travis: Could I have a large?] bodies.
Travis: [crosstalk] Sorry, it’s just– I have broad shoulders, you know?
Clint: [crosstalk] I’ll give you a grande.
Clint: So you really don’t feel anything. Maybe a, a little bit of a tingle, but that’s– that’s it.
Griffin: I mean, my tummy itch situation is very serious and very immediate.
Nadiya: I feel a little bit of a tingle? Is that– is that normal? Just a little bit of one?
Potts: Just a little bit of a tingle is awesome.
Nadiya: Yeah, just a little– I’m getting some ASMR? Is that normal?
Potts: Yes.
Clint: Alright, so it– there’s a different timeframe for everybody. As we watch, from the control room, we can see seams starting to appear in Remy’s golem, and, large chunks of it just start sloughing off and falling to the ground. And when that happens–
Travis: [gasp] Guh-ross… (???)
Clint: When that happens, the nozzle array over Remy withdraws and raises up into the ceiling.
Griffin: I fall to my knees, ‘cause I imagine that was pretty exhausting and disorienting. And I just kinda stay there on my knees for a little bit. And then I look up. And with both hands, I touch my temples, and open my eyes wide and just yell and
Remy: [imitating laser noises] Byew! Byew! Byew!
Clint: Nothing. You start making that sound?
Griffin: Yes. [laughing]
Clint: Yeah, no powers have manifested for Remy.
Griffin: Aww.
Clint: Which is not that unusual because, you know–
Travis: Didn’t work!
Clint: It is a three–part system.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: All of a sudden, places start appearing on Irene’s golem. They look like sparks. But they’re moving around on the surface of the golem. And when that happens, Irene’s nozzle array starts to withdraw, like Remy’s did. But when they move, the sparks move to the top of the golem’s head and points at the nozzle array. And there’s a pulse and this surge of electricity, an arc of electricity shoots up and hits the nozzle array.
Griffin: Oh, shit.
Clint: And when that happens, all the lights flicker, but come back on. And Potts says,
Potts: Irene? Talk to me, what’s going on in there?
Irene: I– I don’t know, I feel strange.
Clint: The sparks are moving around. This time, they are facing Remy. They all come together into that one spot. And when that happens, at the same time, Remy, you feel that tingling sensation give like a huge surge. All through your body.
Griffin: Yeah, I’m gonna fuckin somersault right out of the way.
Clint: And just then, the sparks on the body pulse right in front of you. Roll Athletics.
Griffin: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, that is a zero, but I have a plus five athletics and I also– do I have superpowers now?
Clint: You have superpowers now.
Griffin: Well then I also have Uncanny Dodge: if you see a projectile coming you can get out of the way with clever gymnastics, you gain plus two to defense rolls when dodging ranged attacks. So that’s seven.
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s seven.
Clint: Alright, describe the leap.
Griffin: I think it’s almost like he doesn’t realize what he’s… doing? ‘Cause I mean he doesn’t know that he has superpowers, so I think he just, like, his body, he moves it in a way where he thinks he’s just kinda moving to the right a little bit, but he actually plants a hand on the ground and jumps ten feet into the air off the handspring and lands, like, flawlessly. And looks at his hands, and his feet, and looks up at Potts on the other side of the glass like,
Remy: [panicked nervous laughter] Uh huh… uh huh… uhhh??
Clint: Alright, and the arc of electricity hits the pad where you had been standing. The lights flicker again, but come back on.
Remy: Irene, I don’t know if you can hear, but you need to chill in there, maybe!
Clint: Grace speaks in your earbuds and says
Grace: Nadiya’s vitals are all over the place.
Clint: And Nadiya’s golem has started to shift, and move, without any seams. And Joe says
Joe: Ah… That’s new.
Clint: But when Nadiya’s golem starts to move, the sparks shift towards the side where Nadiya is.
Griffin: Jesus…
Clint: And Joe says in the earbuds,
Joe: Nadiya! Your golem’s movin’! It’s very important that it not! Move!
Clint: And Potts says,
Potts: Remy, we can’t open the hatch to help you until the filaments are pumped out of the room.
Clint: What do you do?
Griffin: Does it look like electricity is about to shoot at… ‘cause you said it was forming on Irene, about to hit Nadiya?
Clint: It was aiming– yeah. When Nadiya’s golem started to move, the sparks moved in that direction.
Griffin: I mean, I can either go look at those fans, or I can try to help Nadiya or Irene out, right?
Clint: Your call. It’s an RPG.
Griffin: Yeah. [Justin laughs]
Griffin: So they’re both still in their golems, right? They’re both…
Clint: They are still in their golems.
Griffin: I ask
Remy: Can I– can I move Irene? Can I try to get this lightning from, stop blasting around the room?
Potts: I don’t know if I would move her. It’s still in the process. Until she comes out of the golem, it would be extremely dangerous.
Griffin: Okay, I want to try to talk to Irene, to get her to calm down, or like gain some control over this thing? I don’t know if that would be Empathy or Rapport, but if I can’t move her, it feels like this is the thing I can do to stop this situation from escalating right now.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: Is Nadiya still responsive and hearing and everything?
Clint: No, Nadiya, you guys are in communication.
Griffin: Alright, I say,
Remy: Nadiya, you’ve gotta help me calm Irene down or else she’s gonna fry both of us.
Nadiya: I’m a little, uh… distracted
Remy: Okay.
Nadiya: if I’m going to be honest. There’s uh… a lot going on… right now. But, uh, I will do what I can. In the meantime, you could maybe draw her fire?
Remy: Uh– Oh yeah! Seems like it’s attracted to movement. I can do that.
Griffin: I run over just towards Irene and start, I dunno. I do a flip right in front of Irene trying to move around more than Nadiya is, to try to attract the fire.
Clint: The sparks shift to the other side [Griffin: Okay.] and there’s a pulse, and another arc of electricity starts to head your way.
Griffin: I roll out of the way of it. [Clint: Alright.] That’s a fucking ten.
Clint: Excellent. Yeah, you–
Travis: You rolled so good, you become Sonic the Hedgehog.
Griffin: Yeah, I literally go supersonic with that one.
Clint: The lightning arc, instead, hits the wall, and this time the lights flicker and go out.
Griffin: Oh my god.
Clint: And Potts says,
Potts: Irene? Irene…
Clint: In the darkness, you hear that sloughing sound again, and the lights come back up. Justin, what do we see?
{23:33}
Kardala: Finally. I demand meat!
[Griffin laughs]
Remy: Who the– who is this? Who are you?
Kardala: My name is Kardala, little man, and I have been freed from the Irene prison, and I demand meat.
Remy: Does anybody– can you– Two things: I don’t have any meat. I’m basically nude right now, but also, please stop shooting lightning at all of us.
Kardala: Oh. Of course.
Clint: Potts’s voice kicks in.
Potts: Remy, the filaments are almost cleared, and security is on the way [Kardala grunts], but if anything happens to Nadiya while she’s still in golem form–
Justin: [crosstalk] Irene rips out her earpieces. Er, sorry, Kardala rips out her earpieces. No way.
Potts: Remy, we can’t let her harm Nadiya in any way, shape, or form until she comes out of the golem. It would be fatal.
Kardala: Little man, you will redirect me to meat or you will be meat, or you will– is this your prison? Have you created this prison for me?
Remy: Uh, no? We were doing a… ritual… to… summon you to our wor– I don’t know, that’s a bad lie. I don’t know what’s going on, but this isn’t a prison. We’re going to get out of here in a second, we just need to be patient for like, a minute.
Kardala: I understand you are afraid of the demon. I, too, have been shook to my core– ah, just kidding, little man, I am not afraid. Shall I destroy it for you?
Remy: [panicked] No?
Justin: And Irene starts– Kardala starts to walk over to smash Nadiya.
Griffin: [laughs] I run between them.
Remy: No! Nononono, not a demon. Everything’s good, that’s my–
Kardala: Look at it.
Remy: Yeah… No, it’s– it’s skin all over, and it’s moving around and stretching around all weird and that’s– but that’s I think normal and we are super good here and I– I have jerky? You know jerky, like, it’s like old meat. It’s good as hell, though. I have a lot of that back in my dorm, so I’ll swing by and get you some of that here in like, five minutes, tops.
Kardala: I am famished for… I cannot count the days. I have watched the world through the prison of Irene Baker, and now I am finally free and I wish nothing more than to dine on flesh.
Remy: Flesh?!
Kardala: But, I can be patient.
Remy: Good.
Clint: On the other side of the wall, back in the control room, Martine and Sylvain enter the monitor chamber with weapons drawn.
Kardala: Mmm! Okay.
Clint: Martine says,
Martine: Open the hatch, Pottsy.
Clint: And Potts refuses.
Kardala: Pottsy, I would listen to them. Open the hatch. This hatch.
Remy: Uh. Don’t do that, not ‘til Nadiya’s awake. Nadiya, can you hear me– can you, like, finish molting or whatever?
Kardala: Who is Nadiya? Where is she?
Remy: She’s the demon one, you thought she was.
Clint: You hear Joe in your earbuds,
Joe: Nadiya, listen to me. For some reason the Skinthetics seem to be reacting with your body. You are not going to be able to reject the Skinthetic. It will not slough off. You– It seemed to be reacting to your arm for some reason.
Nadiya: Oh, yeah. I have the– the skin graft, um. This is unexpected. Give me a second.
Travis: I would like to roll Will.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: Oh wait, I have a program that does that. Not great. But uh, a two? So, fair. [Clint: Okay.] I’m going to– because– okay, so here’s why I’m doing this. What Nadiya knows about her creation, the BioSkin – the Skinthetic, as you were calling it – is that it reacts to your body. It becomes part of your body, so if this is doing a skin – if it’s attracted to the skin graft that she already has, she’s trying to somehow, you know, make it become part– work with her body instead of against it.
Clint: Okay, I like that. Your body starts to actually absorb the Skinthetic. Over on the other side of the wall, Martine said– instructs Sylvaine, and Sylvaine goes over and restrains Potts–
Remy: [crosstalk] Hey hey hey hey! C’mon!
Clint: [crosstalk] pulls Potts away, pulls Potts away from the controller. Martine starts punching buttons to open the hatch.
Nadiya: Give me… just one more minute. I think I’ve almost got it.
Clint: Joe says,
Joe: You and your fella do not run things here, Martine. Three department heads here say give ‘em time.
Clint: And Martine says,
Martine: I’ll give you one minute. I’m the one department head with a gun.
Griffin: You gonna shoot everybody? Ya ding dong?
Clint: Nadiya, you need to roll– I say roll Will again to see if you can stabilize.
Travis: I’m gonna roll Science!
Clint: [bemused] Okay…
Griffin: Eat that skin!
Travis: [dice rolling noise] Oh wait, I have a program–
Griffin: Why– you just forgot it within the span of, like, ninety seconds.
Travis: Okay but I did– I rolled a three. Three pluses and a blank.
Griffin: Ohh, it’s not in the program– [Travis: I know] that’s why we’re using the program– specifically for Travis.
Travis: But I rolled three pluses, and a blank, plus four, so seven.
Clint: Okay.
Justin: Do these guys have guns drawn on Kardala?
Clint: On the other side of the hatch, yeah.
Griffin: Uh oh.
Justin: Through the glass, right?
Clint: Yeah, but that’s why she wants to open the hatch– they couldn’t shoot through the glass.
Justin: Can I see that– is it like a transparent situation or I can, I can see.
Clint: It is transparent, yeah.
Justin: Okay, Kardala walks up and smashes the– punches the glass as hard as she can with her fists.
Clint: Okay.
Justin: Sorry it’s just like, untenable, that they would have guns drawn on her.
Clint: Okay.
Justin: Okay it’s a negative one, and I guess this would be…
Griffin: Uh, Physique. Or– yeah.
Justin: Physique?
Griffin: Or Fight?
Justin: Or Fight… fighting–
Griffin: [crosstalk] Physique is like feats of strength. I don’t think it’s fi– I think it would be Physique.
Justin: Physique, okay. So three minus one, so a two. Which according to the Fate ladder is…
Travis: Fair!
Justin: Fair.
Clint: Okay. The uh, the transparent wall… splinters, spiderwebs. At that point, the hatch pops open and Martine says,
Martine: Okay! Looks like everything’s okay. Everybody’s fine, everybody’s stabilized. Great.
Clint: She holsters her weapon, instructs Sylvaine, he holsters his weapon. She says,
Martine: Terrific! Alright you guys. Patch ‘em up, feed ‘em, get ‘em outfitted.
Remy: Wait– you can’t just come in here and point guns at everybody and then be cool about it!
Kardala: I demand battle!
Martine: It’s comin’. Trust me. But not now! We need to get you skimmin’ and in the air in one hour!
Travis: Um, I am going to, like a cinder block, punch Martine with my new giant polymer fist. And that would be a five.
Clint: Alright, that hits her. [Griffin laughing] Hits her–
Kardala: [excited] Yes!
Clint: Doesn’t hurt her.
Kardala: This demon craves battle! I like this demon!
Clint: Uh, and she sprawls out on the floor, Sylvain draws down on you.
Nadiya: [sarcastically] Sorry– Sorry about that. Um. I was just….really angry, and… huh. I see. Interesting. Wasn’t expecting that at all, huh.
Remy: You can turn your body into a rock like the Kirby power?
[quiet laughter]
Nadiya: Apparently…?
Remy: Do another rock! Do a different– can you be a big–
Nadiya: Uh… yeah lemme see, hold on. Uh… name a weapon.
Remy: Uh… two swords.
Nadiya: Okay.
Kardala: Spear.
Nadiya: I– I’ll do the two swords first.
Remy: Well, do spear first, because she gets angry real fast.
Nadiya: Okay. Spear. Let’s see…
Travis: Will plus two… so six? Form a spear with one hand. Mmm… shield maybe? So that’s an eight to form a shield with the other hand.
Nadiya: Huh. Interesting. Oh! Uh, yes.
Travis: I help [chuckles] Martine up.
Nadiya: Sorry!
Clint: And she smiles at ‘ya, she wipes away a little blood that came out of her nose, and Martine says–
Martine: I like it. Nice job, everybody!
Nadiya: Yeah.
Martine: Now get ‘em ready, they’re in the air in one hour.
Kardala: Who shall I punch?
Remy: No– let’s– can somebody meat her? Get her some meat? This is– she has sort of a one track mind about- hey, by the way, is Irene just gone? What happened?
{{Justin|Kardala: Irene is a prison [
Remy: Mhm, yeah.] that was constructed to keep me, Kardala-
Remy: [disheartened] She was actually pretty cool.
Nadiya: It- can we, can we talk to Irene- is Irene in there?
Kardala: Sure, go ahead. Ask Irene something.
Remy: Irene, what’s your favorite movie?
Kardala: [pretending to be Irene] I love to watch movies
Remy: Okay, so it’s–
Kardala: and I eat popcorn also!
Remy: I think Irene’s gone.
Kardala: That was a trick!
Clint: [Laughs]
Remy: Hey, Kardala, I just also like wanna know what are you, is this like a Jekyll and Hyde situation? Is- is th- ar- what’s goin on?
Kardala: My name is the thunder goddess Kardala, you may call me Kardala.
Remy: Cool.
Kardala: I watch over people of the North, and protect them and serve bounty, but mainly I have been imprisoned for years inside a prison called-
Remy: [crosstalking] Yeah, inside a prison called Irene, yeah.
Kardala: -Irene Baker. You know of her, yes.
Remy: Yeah.
Kardala: Now I have been freed. And all I desire, at the moment, is meat. I will... figure out next steps after that.
Nadiya: Big picture, okay. You know what, actually? I’m pretty hungry too. If we could grab a sandwich or something,
Kardala: Yes!
Nadiya: I am now apparently human Silly Putty. Um, and it’s a lot to process, so.
Griffin: Remy says,
Remy: Uh, yeah, I can eat.
Griffin: And I try to take a step towards the door, but I leap, like, 20 feet forward and crash into the wall, and I’m like,
Remy: Okay, I gotta recalibrate, I guess, my movement a little bit. I think I can jump super good, by the way, which, to be a little honest, is a little disappointing, ‘cause I did already know how to jump pretty good. And also like, I was an Olympic athlete, and I trained for that my whole life, and didn’t get weekends or a childhood, really, so if I knew that they could just sort of matrix super-jumping into you, I probably would have just, like. Wasted all of my time playing Yugioh cards– well, wasting more of my time playing Yugioh cards.
Nadiya: To be fair, I thought I would become some kind of like. Well, I was going to say Reed Richards, and I guess that that is more–
Remy: Yeah, the circle gets the square.
Nadiya: Yeah. I meant in the super smart scientist way. But I think the stretchy way, I guess. Let me see.
Travis: And she tries to stretch, and she cannot do that.
Griffin: Okay.
Nadiya: Okay, so n– I– Hmm. Mhmm, mhmm. Not… stretchy…
Remy: Um, Potts, is there any way I can go again? And maybe see if I get heat vision this time? Or flight, or…?
Potts: Well, no, but I’ll tell ya one thing, Remy. Our indicators show there’s still some powers being processed in your hands. So, maybe they’ll manifest themselves later on but–
Remy: Heat beams! Pyow!
Griffin: I stick my hands out [laser noises]
Nadiya: All of us, or just– just him.
Potts: No no, just Remy.
Nadiya: Aw.
Potts: Just Remy. Something, it’s– it’s just like some kind of energy flow, but it’s- it’s tough to tell. It may show up later, so we’ll just keep an eye on the situation.
Remy: But it’s– it’s in my hands.
Potts: Mhmm.
Remy: In my haaands! Y’all know that one?
[Travis laughing]
[TAZ: Commitment theme fades in 35:32]
[The Money Zone 35:46-41:51]
Clint: It’s an hour later. And you’re on a skimmer.
Travis: Have we eaten?
Clint: You’re zipping over the waves of the Gulf of Mexico, and there are hoagie crumbs and wrappers and strombolis and hot brown remnants– you’ve just eaten the hell out of a bunch of meat sandwiches.
Kardala: Little man, remind me. This one, strom- stromb-
Joe: Stromboli.
Kardala: Stromboli. Yes.
Remy: It’s Italian for ‘the good sandwich’.
Kardala: I very much enjoy the stromboli.
Clint: So. You’re zipping along. And um, of course, remember these are drones that are piloted back by a pilot on the ‘Berg. So it’s just you three. But there is a monitor with a speaker. As you fly along, Parsons, who is the head of Risk Understanding, and basically makes the assignments, says uh
Parsons: Hi everybody. I’m sorry that we, uh, had to put you in this situation–
Griffin: God, that’s good.
Justin: So good.
Parson: – where, uh –
Travis: Man of a thousand voices.
Parsons: –you find yourselves in this– I apologize, but this is of immediate need. And you are the only intact superpowered trio we have at this time. We’re still doing the–
Remy: [strained noise]
Nadiya: Did they die?
Remy: Yeah, intact is a horrible–
Parsons: I’m sorry, uh, alive. You are the only three successful ones so far.
Remy: THERE WAS A CHANCE OF UNSUCCESS?!
Nadiya: Yeah, wait–
Parsons: Well, you knew the job was dangerous when you took it.
Remy: WE DID NOT! We explicitly DID NOT know the job was dangerous when we took it!
Parsons: You are on a rescue mission. And it’s of vital importance. You are going to recover– her name’s Mary. But we called her Space Cadet. Um, she was in the Diplomatic department. She was one of the first recipients of the stimplant technology. And basically– uh, Mary is like a human wifi network. Um, within the hundred yard space, she can basically connect to practically any kind of electronics and exert control over them. But, like I said, this was one of the first ones. And, um. There were some aftereffects that we did not anticipate–
Nadiya: Is she evil now? Is that what’s going on?
Parsons: No, no.
Nadiya: [disbelievingly] Okay.
Parsons: But the technology was not as refined, and her psyche was damaged.
Nadiya: Mhmm.
Parsons: And she fled. She fled the ‘Berg without us knowing it. If she does not get proper treatment, her condition’s gonna deteriorate, and we’re afraid the paranoia will turn inward, and she may harm herself. We really don’t want that to happen. Now, as you know, we cannot remove the stimplants, but we do have some treatments that will help her lead a normal life. Um–
Remy: Does she have two folks with her, also? Giving her– isn’t this like a trio, a triumvirate situation?
Parsons: Um. You’re right, Remy, but as far as we know, no. Nobody else from the program has left. Like I said, she was one of the first ones. And just when the powers activated with the other two, it just, it went bad for Mary.
Remy: Um, quick clarifying question. Um, did you try marijuana once, and did you inhale? [Travis laughs]
Parsons: Um, I did not inhale.
Remy: Okay, fantastic.
Parsons: But I also have a peanut allergy, so I’m not who you think I am.
Justin: Oh, twist.
Parsons: Now, Jamie, who works in my department too, I believe you met her at the mixer, um, as a matter of fact I believe that is who you had kind of a butting of heads with —
Nadiya: Ah. Yes. [crosstalk] Bad with names, is Nadiya.
Parsons: [crosstalk] Jamie and I suspect that Space Cadet has taken refuge in an abandoned theme park on the gulf of Louisiana — on the gulf coast of Louisiana. The park was built by her parents. Do you — you remember the televangelists Stan and Sally Sage? They were very big — they were, had their own TV network, and they were very, very successful, but they were indicted six years ago. Now, they opened this theme park and it shut down.
Remy: Is it a religious themed Noah’s Ark theme park?
Parsons: It is a Bible-related theme park. [crosstalk] Every—
Remy: [crosstalk] Excellent.
Parsons: Every creature, every person that you see there, a lot of audio — a lot of animatronics, they are all from the Bible.
Nadiya: Are we going to have to — I’m sorry. [heavy sigh] Are we going to have to deal with, like, robot Jesus and stuff?
Parsons: Our intelligence does not extend that far.
Griffin: [laughs] That’s a yes from Dad!
Parsons: So I do not know.
Griffin: That’s a hard Clint McElroy yes.
Nadiya: Okay.
Clint: Just then, the skimmer lands outside a very large sign, and right before the, right before the screen kicks off, you hear Parsons say,
Parsons: Bring her home to us, please.
Kardala: No.
[someone laughs]
Remy: Oh — okay —
Kardala: Little man, thank you for your story, if that was to be a story. I have no interest in…”Mary”. I will depart on my own way, fare thee well to all of you—
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Coward.
Kardala: I have a conquest beyond.
Remy: That’s a terrible idea.
Kardala: Ssssssorry, demon?
Nadiya: Oh, I’m, I said “coward.”
Remy: [crosstalk] Oh, Jesus.
Nadiya: You’re running away, is what you said, right? So you’re quite the—
Kardala: [laughs sinisterly]
Griffin: I’m walking backwards away from this.
Kardala: The demon thinks Kardala a coward.
Nadiya: No, it’s fine, I’ll just do it on my own. I don’t even need you, I mean, what could you possibly do to help? Um, Jump Boy and I will take care of it, and you—
Remy: [crosstalk] Jump Boy is very good—
Justin: [crosstalk] Just as she gets — she gets as far as “what could you possibly do to help?” and Kardala reaches her hands out of her, like, sort of long white cloak, and slaps them together and creates a gust of wind in Nadiya’s direction, um, which, let’s see, that would be...I guess Will, since it’s magic, basically.
That is a zero, and that gets added to my Will which is a three...it says the opposition is generally fair with the, with creating a specific weather pattern, so, three would beat [Clint: Yep!] the opposition. So I create a gust of wind towards her. Not like, you know, damaging, but basically, you know, super fast.
Clint: Well Nadiya, what do you do?
Travis: Oh, I take it. I’m— I am goading Kardala.
Griffin: Yeah, it’s definitely a reverse psychology situation.
Travis: Yeah, yeah. I’m—
Clint: Okay, I’d say — I’d say it knocks you back a few feet, [Travis: Mmhmm.] maybe? Kinda staggers you. Does not knock you over, but it does definitely push you back, and when it pushes you back, it pushes you back against the hatch of the skimmer, and it pops open.
Nadiya: Okay! So, are we all going, then?
Remy: Yeah, I mean, I’m down, let’s just not antagonize the thunder god for, just like a general rule.
Kardala: Do you, demon, admit now that you require the assistance of Kardala?
Nadiya: [sarcastically] Yes, you know, I’ve seen the error of my ways, Kardala. Now I don’t think we can do this without you, thank you, so much, for helping us.
Kardala: Look now how the demon begs!
[Griffin laughs]
Kardala: Thus is the might of Kardala. Yes, you have convinced me. I take pity on you, lesser creature, and I will follow you to retrieve this…”Mary.”
Griffin: I get a stromboli out of the skimmer and I start, like, walking backwards with it, like, ‘this way !’
Kardala: The thunder god is not a dog to be teased.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ok, I thought maybe it’d be like a—
Kardala: [crosstalk] I will, however, relieve you of this stromboli.
Griffin: I thought we might have a E.T. Reese’s Pieces situation on our hands, but I was mistaken.
Clint: All right, you step out of the Skimmer and there’s a very large sign that says “Welcome to Halleluland!”
Griffin: Oh, jeez. Literally.
Clint: And there is a street of—
Justin: Can I just say, I’m so glad you guys talked Kardala into that because there’s nothing I want to see more than the Bible theme park my Dad made!
Travis: Yaaaaay!
Clint: There is a gold road— it’s not real gold, or it would have been stripped by now— by the way, everything here is in slight disrepair.
Travis: Oh, so it’s like my recurring nightmare of being in an abandoned amusement park. Thanks, Dad. [Griffin laughs]
Travis: This is great.
Justin: Except there are apostles here!
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah!
Clint: [crosstalk] I may put spiders in there, too, Trav, I know you love spiders.
Travis: [crosstalk] Ah, cool! Can they be robot Jesus spiders?
Clint: [crosstalk] So you walk along— you walk along this street of gold, and you come up to a gigantic wall, 50 feet high, with a giant white gate, which at some point probably was supposed to look like it was carved out of a single pearl, but, it’s fallen kind of into disrepair. But in front of this gate is a half of a statue.
You see a large mechanical framework of a man, from like the waist up, arms outstretched, palms up, blocking you from getting to the gate. And as you approach, the eyes light up in this bizarre metal face. A lot of the— a lot of it has fallen apart, but you can still see the metallic, and you can still see the palms. The palms are like, you know, eight feet across, they’re huge. And a voice comes out of the head and says,
Saint Peter: Step up and tell me of your faith. In what do you believe?
Remy: I mean, this is a very personal question, giant robot, I just met you—
Nadiya: It’s Saint Peter.
Remy: No, I get it.
Nadiya: Okay, I just wanted to make sure that was clear. That’s what’s going on.
Travis: Nadiya steps up.
Nadiya: Uh, I believe in science, and learning—
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’m just trying—
Clint: [crosstalk] There’s no response, by the way.
Griffin: I feel like Remy’s just like, what are we doing here? This is just a big animatronic guy, we’re, we don’t need to be talking to this right now, I feel like.
Saint Peter: Step up and tell me of your faith. In what do you believe?
Clint: And you notice that these two hands are equidistant above the ground, about three feet off the ground each, like scales. [Griffin groans]
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay, yeah.
Remy: I mean, hard work and perseverance and dedication and loyalty and...any of these the password, or…?
Saint Peter: Step up—
Griffin: [crosstalk] All right—
Saint Peter: and tell me of your faith.
Griffin: I jump up onto the left hand.
Remy: I think we have to step up, literally.
Clint: Good. When you do, the eyes light up and the voice says,
Saint Peter: Now, tell me of your faith. In what do you believe?
Clint: And when you step up on that hand, it sinks to the ground.
Remy: Nadiya, can you hop up, or Kardala, can you hop up in the other hand of this very scary—
Kardala: I won’t hop.
Remy: Can you climb up?
Kardala: Yes. [Griffin chuckles] I shall be judged.
Saint Peter: In what do you believe? Tell me of your faith.
Remy: Jesus. Jesus and the Bible? Is that it?
Kardala: Yes. Like the little man said. Jesus and the Bible.
Clint: When you say that, your hand — the hand that Kardala stands on— sinks all the way to the ground.
Kardala: Ah. You enjoy Jesus!
[Griffin laughs]
Kardala: I...I love Jesus, and the Bible that he wields. So terrible. Very—
Clint: He’s like a coworker!
Kardala: Yes. We called him Dave!
Griffin: [laughing] Oh, jeez.
Clint: Okay, Nadiya, what do you do?
Travis: ...I don’t know. [laughs] Um, so right now the hands are on the ground, right?
Clint: No, no no, when Kardala got on the palm and activated it, the— it sank to the ground, and the hand that Remy was standing on raised up in the air.
Travis: I walk under that hand.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: And I head for the gate.
Clint: Still closed.
Travis: I hit it really hard with the big hammer fist.
Clint: [makes sound effect like something hitting a metal door] Wooonnngggg!
Kardala: Yes!
Clint: Nothing.
Kardala: I will join the Demon in this path!
Justin: Kardala hops off and goes to punch the gate.
Clint: Remy goes right down to the ground in his hand.
Remy: Ow!
Clint: Wooonnnngggg!
Remy: Okay. We can make the hands move, and that’s great. I think we have to balance it out, maybe? Like scales?
Justin: Kardala goes back to the, her platform.
Remy: Let’s both say Jesus at the same time? One, two, three, Jesus?
Kardala: Yes, you count.
Remy: One...two...three...Jesus!
Kardala: [simultaneously] Jesus!
Clint: Kardala’s hand goes down to the ground, Remy’s goes up in the air.
Remy: Oh, my gosh.
Kardala: We are both saying Jesus. Perhaps my faith is stronger than yours. I have spoken for many minutes about my love of Jesus and his terrible Bible. [others laughing] Perhaps your faith in Jesus is not as strong as Kardala’s.
Remy: All right, Nadiya, get over here and talk about how great science is.
Kardala: You must both believe in Jesus to equal my faith in— my newfound faith in Jesus.
Travis: All right, Nadiya climbs up on the hand with Remy.
Kardala: Speak of your love of Jesus, Nadiya!
Remy: [muffled] Yeah, he’s great.
Saint Peter: Tell me of your faith. In what do you believe?
Nadiya: I believe in science.
Remy: Je— Oh, I thought we were doing J— okay.
Clint: And the hand that you are standing on starts to lower, and the hand that Kardala’s on starts to raise…
Kardala: Now wait, who is science, and—
Justin: No, I’m just kidding, Kardala knows what science is.
Clint: [crosstalk] And the hand with Remy and Kardala— ah, I’m sorry, with Remy and Nadiya [Griffin: Nadiya], slowly sinks down to the ground, but very slowly.
Remy: All right, I’ll get off, and I think we’re supposed to be balancing sort of faith in science, at this point. Right? I think that’s what this statue is trying to get us to, to do.
Clint: Someone could do an investigation check.
Travis: Oh yeah!
Justin: Yeah. Shit. Yeah. Not Kardala.
Travis: Ok. So, uh, my investigation is plus three, I rolled a zero, so that’s three.
Griffin: I also got a three.
Clint: Okay. You noticed that in the transition of the one arm coming down, when they were equidistant, when they were just about the same, the pearly gates started to hum and vibrate a little bit. But then when you sank the rest of the way down— now, this is with both of you on it—
Griffin: Yeah, I’m getting— I’m getting off. I think that’s what we needed to do. Some—
Remy: Kardala, you’re on that hand. Nadiya, you’re on that hand. Nadiya, you do all your science jazz—
Nadiya: Okay.
Remy: —and, Kardala, you talk about how great your, your best friend Jesus is, with his awesome ‘Bible’.
Kardala: Does anyone know anything else about Jesus? I feel like I’m beginning to repeat myself.
Remy: Uh, he did— he made one fish turn into like a bunch of fish.
Kardala: Aahh. This I can respect! Provider Jesus, the creator of fish! I love him very much, and I believe in him and his terrible, scythe-like Bible!
Remy: And, Nadiya, what’s the best elements? Just start, just talk science and give me that jazz.
Nadiya: I’m— I’m not a chemist, you know that—
Remy: [crosstalk, strained] Just say some science stuff and how great it is!
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Okay, okay, all ri- okay. Uh, I like lasers, and making fake skin, and polymers, and plastics, and microchips. Beakers and bunsen burners and stuff. I love science.
Clint: As you speak, your hand sinks, sinks, sinks, and there’s a moment, again, where they’re the same distance off the ground—
Remy: Get off, get off, get off!
Travis: Then we get off, then we get off.
Clint: And the pearly gates open.
Travis: Hey, we did it!
Griffin: Everything in moderation, folks.
Travis: That’s why I believe in science Jesus!
Clint: All right, so you follow this street of gold past the pearly gates, and you’re walking around. You eventually come up to a very large clearing, and this clearing is full of wild— I mean, it’s overgrown, but it’s kind of this wild version of lilies of the valley. So this field is sprung up, overgrown, weedy, but you can still see the lilies of the valley. And, uh, you walk into this clearing, and...what do you do?
Travis: Ok, I’m gonna do Notice.
Griffin: Yeah, I could also—
Travis: Not great.
Griffin: I got a one on Notice.
Travis: I got a zero! I roll negative one, plus my one, equals zero.
Clint: The only thing you really notice is that even though this is overgrown, you can still see the street of gold stretching on ahead to, uh, to a bunch of trees, and as you look, through the trees comes a woman riding on a unicorn.
Griffin: This is the weirdest Bible place ever! Cause they definitely, I don’t think were in that one.
Clint: And you hear a voice say,
Voice: Isaiah 34:7. And the unicorn shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls, and their land shall be soaked up with blood—
Griffin: I was— I stand corrected.
Voice: and their dust made fat with fatness.
Griffin: There’s unicorns in the Bible, y’all! Had no idea!
Clint: The unicorn trots up, and the woman gets off of the unicorn.
Griffin: Is it a robot woman?
Clint: It is a robot woman, yes. And as she walks up, you hear a voice speak, and the voice says,
Voice: Mark 6:22-25. When the daughter of Herodius came and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests, and the king said, “Ask me for everything you want and I’ll give it to you.” And he promised her an oath: “Whatever you ask, I shall give you.” She went out and asked her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And her mother said—
Remy: I know this one!
Voice: “The head of John the Baptist.”
Remy: Aww.
Clint: And at that point, the robotic woman pulls her hand out from behind her back and sure enough, she has the severed head of a man, her fingers tangled in his hair,
Griffin: Happy Halloween, everybody!
Travis: Is it a robot head?
Clint: It’s a robot head.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Oh, okay.
Clint: And the robot woman screams,
Robot Woman: GET OUT!
[Commitment Theme music]
Clint: And when she says that, the eyes of the severed head opens and fix on you, and the head speaks:
Severed Head: I’d listen to her, fellas! She always gets what she wants, trust me!
Clint: And the unicorn charges toward you.

[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Commitment Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: Let’s just get into it! Let’s just get on it– [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Roll your ball!
Griffin: –roll that fuckin’ ball!
Clint: Are we...are we good? Should we just charge right in?
Griffin: Let’s just do it! We’re about to fight a big fucking robot unicorn and I’m ready!
Travis: Yeah, if you want to know the “Previously on…” go back and relisten to the episode!
Clint: Good point.
Griffin: Things Remy has done since he got superpowers: Jumped into a wall, and then solved a-a riddle from a big St. Peter. Things he has not done: Jumped and fought. It’s time. It is now.
Justin: I would appreciate, uh, reminding us of what we’re doing.
Travis: No, we’re fighting a unicorn and a robot or whatever, let’s goooo!
Clint: I’ll make it very simple. You’re in a field of lilies of the valley, the-the golden road has kinda fallen into disrepair. Right ahead of you is this thick line of trees. A robot Salome has come in riding on a unicorn. She jumps off the unicorn, she drops John the Baptist’s head – ah, I forgot to put John the Baptist’s head on the–
Travis: [crosstalk] No, but let’s just say, Dad,–
Clint: [crosstalk] –the map.
Travis: –your map game is–
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s improving! You’re gonna be-
Travis: [crosstalk] And I just want to say, I love how you see all the little flowers everywhere, Dad has added some more appropriate, like, fanart versions of us as the icons–
Griffin: There’s no inanimate– there’s no inanimate objects representing living human beings, which is very exciting.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, but then right up there in the top right-hand corner, is–
Clint: No, no, no, no! Don’t give it away!
Travis: Wha-
Justin: What are you talking about, don’t give it away? You’re showing us!
Travis: [cross talk] It’s there on the– it’s the stuff of nightmares! We’ll get to it, guess.
Clint: We’ll get to it. As a matter of fact, it’s coming right now.
Justin: Ok.
Clint: Ok, so, I told you the unicorn, this giant robot unicorn, has charged forward after, uh, Ditto challenged me on the biblical authenticity of unicorns.
Travis: That was in character.
Griffin: No, that was–
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh, that’s right.
Griffin: No, that was me. I didn’t know.
Clint: Oh, ok. So this Salome robot starts to dance–
Travis: [crosstalk] Salome!
Clint: But it’s really kind of weird. Uh, it’s kind of like, herky-jerky, like somebody doing the robot, which [laughing] I guess is appropriate! Um, but as she dances, as she spins, a couple of the veils that are wrapped around her start to unwind from her body.
Travis: Gross.
Clint: Now these are very specific, they are called rumals, and they’re a weapon, they’re weighted at the end. And she spins faster and faster. So the unicorn is charging on you, and just then, you hear this high pitched buzzing sound coming from the trees, and John the Baptist’s head pops– pipes up, and says:
John the Baptist: Genesis 3:24. At the east of the garden of Eden, he stationed the Cherubim and the flaming sword.
Griffin: Oh god, they just moved! They moved! [yelling and some laughter]
Clint: Do you need cherubim?
Griffin: Sorry, Dad has chosen the scariest possible sort of iconography for the cherubim on this map, and he–
Travis: It looks like if weeping angels had babies.
Griffin: And he moved them and it gave me a terrible fright.
Clint: Three incredibly adorable baby angels–
Travis: [crosstalk] No! No!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Wrong. Incorrect.
Clint: –come flying out of the trees, each with adorable little flaming swords, which I couldn’t find on the icons, so I–
Travis: Are they like, scale sized the size of like cocktail swords, or a little bit bigger?
Clint: Aw, that would be awful cute, wouldn’t it?
Travis: Yeah.
Clint: Well these are, these are shaped in the size of real babies, so. And, uh, the unicorn starts making a bee-line for Kardala, the cherubim zoom towards Nadiya, and Salome launches her first rumal straight at Remy. So, I would like you–
Travis: Cherubims! Why did it have to be cherubims? [someone snorts with laughter]
Clint: Alright, I need you guys to roll to determine who’s going to go first. So what we’ll do is, roll your Fate die, and add your, uh, athletics bonus to it so I can decide who goes– so we can decide who goes first.
Griffin: Uh, I have, uh, plus 5.
Travis: I rolled a 2, plus 1, a 3.
Justin: Yeah, I’ll, uh, go ahead and add a 1, so I got a 1.
Clint: Remy’s going to go first.
Griffin: I turn to the other two and I say,
Remy: I really don’t want to punch a baby. I know that they’re robots, but it’s still a little bit upsetting.
Nadiya: She– it’s a robot. I can logically distance myself from the fact that that is not a real baby, Remy, like–
Remy: Fair enough.
Nadiya: You get that, right? You fight robot dance lady, I’ll fight robot babies, Kardala?
Kardala: Yes?
Nadiya: Robot unicorn. This– I feel like our dance cards are full, as they say.
Kardala: I do not appreciate your order, but I would like to punch the unicorn.
[Clint laughs]
Nadiya: Yeah.
Remy: I think it’d be a lot easier for you to punch this unicorn if it was lying down.
Griffin: And I grab the rumal as they’re coming at me, and I want to try to trip the unicorn. Like, they’re long strips of fabric, right? With– with weighted–
Clint: Yeah. But they’re like, this really high-tech mesh–
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: –they’ll stretch, but they’re not gonna tear or break.
Griffin: Well I mean if they’re flying at me, I just wanna grab them out of the air and then try to like, uh, clothesline the unicorn as it’s coming, like, get it under the legs and knock it down. Try to interrupt its charge.
Clint: All right.
Griffin: What would that be?
Clint: All right. Well, you tell me, what do you want to use? Tell me, [crosstalk] are you gonna grab the rumal?
Griffin: [crosstalk] I think– yeah, I think because it’s like a ranged attack and I’m trying to interrupt it, I feel like athletics would be...cause I don’t see anything else, really– maybe physique, but that’s more like a feat of strength, this is more of a feat of, like, coordination. [crosstalk] Yeah. So...
Clint: [crosstalk] Ok. All right.
Griffin: Well, that’s not going to be good. So that is a 2.
Clint: Ok. [crosstalk] And so Salome–
Travis: [crosstalk] And you’re rolling– just to be clear, rolled a negative 2, plus 4...
Griffin: [crosstalk] Plus 4 is, yeah, and I don’t think I’m going to add anything to it, cause this is not, uh, “anything requiring leaping, balancing, or otherwise demonstrating your agility”.
Clint: I think because of the accuracy of her throw, I think, uh, I think the rumal actually impacts you. [Griffin groans] The weighted part of the rumal hits you–
Griffin: [crosstalk] I fucking– I see them coming and I, like, [clapping sound] clap my hands together and put up like a catcher’s stance, and they just fucking level me.
Clint: Oh, yeah! I like that! But you caught it, uh, and you went down. [crosstalk] All right?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ok. I take a– I take a stress, I imagine.
Clint: Yeah, you take 1 stress.
Travis: Ok, so we haven’t dealt with this yet. In Fate, um, when you take hits, you have, like, um, so– say you take 1 point of dam– 1 point of stress, is what it’s called.
Griffin: Basically you have hit points in the form of stress, and if you take too many of those you get a consequence, and consequences are aspects that Dad can invoke and they can be something like broken rib, or a bloody nose, or concussion, or something like that. And...yeah. [crosstalk]
Clint: So you–
Remy: I got, I got the thing! I got the thing. So don’t worry about that. Disarmed!
Clint: Who– who’s going next? I’m going to let you pick who goes next.
Griffin: Oh, that’s right! So this is the best thing, we learned about this in the demo session we did, [Clint: Right.] combat order is, you– you pick who goes next, but you, if I just pick, you know, Justin, and then Justin picks Travis, then the enemy gets to go, what, three times in a row, which could be bad.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: Uh, I feel like Salome would go next.
Clint: Ok. Well, I think that, uh, what she does is she, uh, lets go of that, uh, rumal, and, uh, spins again. She’s got another one unwinding. [Griffin: Aw, man.] She’s sending it back towards you again.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Shit, I’m already hurting.
Clint: [crosstalk] Um, this time the, uh, the weight at the end of the rumal has a small blade on it.
Griffin: Aw, that’s mean.
Clint: She throws that bladed rumal at you, and she got a negative 3.
Griffin: Oh.
Clint: So combined with that–
Travis: [crosstalk] So it accidentally gives you a really great haircut.
Clint: It goes [laughs] [Griffin: Well.] it goes sailing– it goes sailing right over your prone form and maybe snips off a little bit of your hair.
Remy: No, no no noooo!
Travis: But in a good way! No, but in a good way! ([Griffin]: Oohh!) That’s even better than before.
Griffin: Ok, fantastic.
Clint: I’m going to have, uh, Nadiya go next.
Travis: Great. I’m going to uh, turn my right hand into a whip, and attempt to clip one of, uh, whichever one’s closest to me’s wings.
Clint: It would be...this one, right here.
Travis: Yeah, the– yeah, ok. You don’t have to– please don’t move it.
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: It’s very, very upsetting.
Travis: Uh, so–
Griffin: Jesus, what’s with the negative 2’s? The negative 2 squad’s here!
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, well, so, the idea is like, [makes a whipping sound] rrrrpsh! You know, try to clip the, the end of one wing, try to like, shear off, so that it’s like flying all wonky. Um, that’s a will attack. Uh...doot doot doot doot doo…[dissatisfied] Hmm. Now, I want everyone to know, I could make a solid case here for why aerodynamics are science-based, but we don’t have time for that.
Griffin: Well, is there anything you can do? I mean, you got a bad roll–
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, I– I have–
Griffin: [crosstalk] You can, uh, use one of your Aspects.
Travis: Yeah, with human polymer it’s, uh, will plus 2 for the attack, so it’s a 3.
Clint: I would say that, that smacks into the cherubim’s left wing, and it starts fluttering in kind of a weird way, so the cherubim kinda– he hasn’t gone down yet, it’s still functioning, but he kind of flies off to the side and flies back a little bit out of the way.
Travis: ‘Kay. I’m gonna put down cherubim one, aspect: wonky wing.
Clint: Ok. Who goes next, Nadiya?
Travis: Um, I’m gonna let Kar– no, the u– no, oh god, choices. Unicorn.
Clint: Well, the unicorn’s just gonna charge right at Kardala.
Kardala: Yes! Yes, excellent!
Clint: Now, it is not using its horn. It’s just gonna use–
Travis: It’s using its butt!
Clint: It’s just going to use the impact of running into Kardala to drive Kardala back. [sound of dice being rolled]
Justin: So if you’re attacking, then I get to oppose you [Clint: Right.] with my fight skill. That is a 1, plus–
Griffin: [crosstalk] The first positives of the game.
Justin: 4, that’s a 5.
Clint: The unicorn also rolled a 5.
Griffin: So on a tie, the attack misses, but the attacker gets a boost that they can invoke next time, basically.
Clint: Ok, so the unicorn goes thundering over the turf, slams into Kardala, but she had had time to brace herself, and doesn’t move.
Justin: [crosstalk] All right.
Griffin: [crosstalk] What is the unicorn’s boost? It needs like an aspect that it can invoke next time for free if it wants to. Like very angry, or charging, or, I guess, I don’t know, it could be anything.
Clint: I think that it would, it, maybe it, uh, it now knows a little bit more about Kardala and knows brute force isn’t going to work, how’s that for a boost?
Griffin: Yeah, that’s good.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: [crosstalk] Understanding.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ok, inf– informed.
Clint: Alright, I say Kardala goes next.
Kardala: Yes! Excellent! Excellent try, little horse. Very precious. I will have a trophy from this unicorn.
Justin: And, uh, I’m gonna grab its horn and tear it off [Travis: Oh, snapple.] which, I guess would be...fight?
Griffin: I think that might be physique. [crosstalk] Cause you’re just doing a–
Travis: [crosstalk] I think that might be mean!
Griffin: It’s very– definitely mean, but it’s a feat of strength, and not really an attack, right?
Justin: Um, yeah we can call it physique, because it– I guess– I wouldn’t necessarily be fighting, technically.
Clint: So you got a plus 1?
Justin: Yes.
Clint: [chuckles] Okay. The unicorn has a minus 2 [Travis: Yaaaaay!] So describe it.
Justin: Uh, so Kardala grabs the horn and, uh… sort of like, spins while grabbing the horn, and just like, rips it off. It is, uh, just obvious, like raw strength. Um, and it is clear she is also enjoying herself very much. [Travis laughs]
Clint: All right. Um–
Travis: And everyone kind of stops and goes, damn, whoa. {12:36}
Justin: What happens r.e. the unicorn? Like, when the horn is removed?
Travis: It weeps.
Clint: Uh, it, sparks shoot out of its nose [Justin: Cool.] uh, and it shakes its head violently back and forth and it kinda stumbles a couple of steps away, but it hasn't stopped, it hasn't shut down completely. Um, okay, so, the cherubim are next. But before the cherubim move, John the Baptist's head says,
John the Baptist: Why doth thou abideth– Ohhh, god, forget it, that wasn't the voice. It was more like Charlton Heston. Ah, screw it. Why don't you leave me alone, you assholes?
Travis: Huh?
Remy: Uh, hey, Mary? Are you all these robots? Right? Yes?
Mary: (In John the Baptist's voice) I d– [sighs] (In a normal voice) Yeah, now shut up.
Remy: Okay, can you stop attacking us with all these– we're here to help, I promise, there's really no reason–
Kardala: Noo, are you– No! Continue your assault, ghost!
Mary: Riiight, what else would you say?
Clint: And the two cherubim that are not, uh, not messed up go flying straight at Kardala. They're gonna attack–
Kardala: [crosstalk] Yess! Come to me, babies!
Clint: They're gonna– I'm sorry, Nadiya, I apologize.
Kardala: Dammit.
Clint: I'm sorry. They fly right at Nadiya and wield their flaming swords. A +3 overall.
Griffin: Ahh, Jesus!
Travis: Uuuhhhhhm? Sooo, that's a oone. I'm gonna invoke Rapid Analytical Mind, um, to give me the opportunity to jump out of the way. How about that? My reflexes are heightened because of my rapid analytical mind.
Clint: Okay, I like that.
Justin: Wait, can you just invoke–
Griffin: [crosstalk] You wouldn't just do it. [crosstalk]
Travis: So, well no, so that would be a plus 2, right? So then that would give me 3.
Justin: Okay.
Clint: And the cherubim I think– I said had a 2?
Justin: Mmhmm.
Clint: So, describe it.
Travis: Um, so the cherubim start heading in and Nadiya begins to form her left hand into a shield, and then realizes it's not going to finish in time, and processes the information quickly enough to instead kind of just throw herself to the right.
Clint: And the flaming swords go whistling through the air and miss Nadiya completely.
Griffin: So spend a Fate point, Trav.
Travis: Yes.
Clint: We're back to Remy.
Griffin: Alright. I feel like– so the cherubim are still flying up in the air?
Clint: Yep.
Griffin: Okay, I turn to Nadiya and I say,
Remy: Hey, can we trade? ‘Cause I feel like I can do pretty good against in the air things.
Nadiya: You got it.
Travis: Wait, that's not her voice at all. [laughter]
???: (In a high pitched voice) You got it! [crosstalk]
Travis: (In a high pitched voice) You got it, mister!
Griffin: (In a messed up British accent) YEah, absolutely! (In a normal voice) Uh, alright. [a lot of crosstalk] (not really sure what they're saying)
Nadiya: Yes, please, if you're ready to fight the babies now, and you're not afraid of robot babies anymore, by all means. I'll take dance lady, and you can fight the little babies. Sure.
Remy: No, the babies are terrible now. I've learned a lot about the babies in the last few minutes. I'm not a big fan anymore.
Griffin: I start running towards the, uh, the babies, and– We haven't established what my hands can do yet, right?
Clint: That's right.
Griffin: I think I just wanna–
Travis: [crosstalk] Well, they can grab things, they can wave…
Griffin: No, I've watched Sesame Street, I know what's up. I wanna jump up and just try to, uh, just like, I guess punch one of the robot babies in midair. And just kind of [Clint: Awwww!] see what happens. They have flaming swords, I dunno– Is there something else I could do? Hm.
Clint: No!
Travis: No, punch the babies.
Clint: [crosstalk] You haven't done this–
Travis: By all means, punch a baby.
Clint: Let's see it.
Griffin: Alright, yeah, I'm just gonna do it. And then I imagine there's some sort of energy around my hand when I go in for this attack, right?
Clint: Okay, yeah, like Ironfist.
Griffin: Uh, I don’t know that I need to roll for the jump because my basic super agility lets me jump like two stories high.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: And, so, let’s just roll for fight.
Travis: Let’s hear it for a positive number!
Griffin: Ay a zero! That ain’t nothing, but I have a three in fight and a power called basic natural weapon. You have some sort of built-in weaponry which gives you +2 to fight when brawling unarmed in close quarters. So that's a five.
Clint: And you wanna be punching the one that was already kinda beat up?
Griffin: Nah, I think I'd punch a fresh one, right?
Clint: Okay. Punch a fresh one, where do you punch 'im?
Griffin: In the baby? It's not a lot. And it's– I'm really uncomfortable with how much we're talking about punching a robot baby.
Clint: It's gotta be– what, head? Body? What're you doing?
Griffin: I mean body I guess.
Clint: Okay, right in the gut. [Justin giggling] And when you do, there's this gigantic explosion of sparks.
Griffin: Can I establish something else? ‘Cause we've kind of talked about what this power is. I feel like my fists just have the same sort of kinetic power that powers my jumps? And so I feel like the baby would just go blasting off into the sun, almost. Like it would, it's like I made it jump very very far away when I punched it.
Clint: Alright, bash it then. Boom!
Griffin: Yeah, I think it's fun to make things explode, but I think it's very fun to make things go like flying away. Yeah, okay.
Clint: It goes flying away, into the woods.
Griffin: Alright.
Clint: (singing) Into the woods, into– okay. Alright, so, Salome takes advantage of this situation. She has another rumal that's been spinning, she has another one that's spinning
Remy: Stop hitting me!
Clint: and when Remy goes sailing past, she throws the rumal in his direction. Salome's not trying to hit you with the rumal this time. She throws it to make it wrap around your arms and legs.
Griffin: Alright, I get to evade this though, right?
Clint: Right.
Griffin: I'm really good at this, so. [rolls] Jesus. PLEASUS. Alright, that's a minus 2 but I have plus 4 and an additional plus 2 to avoid dodging– to avoid ranged attacks, so, uh, I guess that's a 4 total.
Clint: Well, she has a 6 total.
Griffin: Beans.
Clint: The rumal wraps around Remy, pinning his arms to his sides, and pinning his legs so they can't move. As soon as he comes to the ground, he hits the ground really hard, which kinda stuns him. Salome jumps on the unicorn and, dragging Remy behind her, goes plowing back up into the trees.
Remy: (getting farther away) Byyyeee!
Clint: And almost as soon as she's out of sight, the two remaining cherubim collapse to the ground, Nadiya's powers fade [Griffin: Oh, shit.] and Kardala turns back into Irene.
Irene: What… is… happening?
Nadiya: Oh, where to start, where to start. Um, you know what? Actually no, just, let's follow him. I don't feel like explaining it.
Irene: Okay, can you give me just, like, a summation? Like a quick overview of where we are?
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Yeah, it– Keep up, I'll explain while we walk. How much do you remember?
Justin: Okay, yadda yadda yadda, we don't actually need to recap the events of the last–
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, and then the propeller spins–
Justin: Yeah, right, the red line crosses the Atlantic, and [Travis: Yeah.] the–
Irene: It sounds like we gotta go after him.
Nadiya: Yes.
Griffin: You can probably follow the sound of my yelling. Cuz I'm definitely, definitely yelling.
Travis: I'm gonna do– investigate roll to like, follow the path and the yelling and stuff?
Clint: Alright.
Travis: NOPE. That's a negative 3!
Griffin: Ohh my god.
Clint: [crosstalk] Okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] My investigate is plus 3, so I'm like, ""Who's Remy?""
Griffin: It's good that this is gonna be such a short arc, because we're all gonna die.
Clint: So what happens is, uh, Remy's shouts fade in the denseness of the trees, but you kinda already know the direction to go in.
Travis: Oh wait, I have an idea! I shall use... Science! And reprogram one of the cherubim to lead us there!
Justin: Okay...
Travis: Okay, well that's a negative 2, but my Science is 4 so I get a 2. To cherubim reprogramming.
Clint: The lil cherubim's eyes open up, and he says, Cherubim: I wuv woo!
Justin: Oh god.
Travis: [crosstalk] Alright.
Clint: And then he stops. Alright, change of scene real quick, before you guys move.
Griffin: Well– how– hey, can I ask how's Remy doin??
Clint: That's where we're going right now.
Griffin: Alright, good.
Clint: We now go to…
Travis: Oh, goodness gracious.
Clint: The next scene. Basically it's a giant recreation of an ancient tabernacle. It's overgrown with weeds, there's whole chunks of plaster that've fallen away, to kinda reveal the infrastructure. There's this big arena in the middle of it, with four entryways from the four points of the compass. And standing up on a raised area at the very northern part of this, stands Mary. She's got a head full of curly red hair, it's tangled and matted, just not very much hair maintenance there going at all. She's still wearing her Fellowship vest, but the rest of her clothes are torn, and dirty.
Travis: Aw man, that's right, our vests were supposed to give us plus to defense. Aww beans.
Griffin: Well, I think they're bulletproof, but anyway.
Clint: And Salome and the unicorn, once they got here. Remy lays in the middle of all that, on the ground in that arena thing, still bound by the rumal. But once they got to a certain point, the unicorn and Salome– I guess it's just a horse now, it's not a unicorn anymore [Justin: Yeah.] The horse and Salome–
Travis: [crosstalk] Well, I mean, it's still genetically a unicorn. You know what I mean? Like–
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Justin: The horn does not make the unicorn, Dad.
Travis: Right.
Clint: That's a good point. Mary looks down at you and says, um,
Mary: Well what are you looking at? You try living on Pronto Pups and Mountain Dew for six weeks, see how you look.
Remy: I would be the happiest boy in the world! Are you kidding me?
[Travis laughs]
Remy: I love those little corny dogs! And a Dew to– a Dew for dippin? Don't mind if I do, come on! It's like a 24/7 LAN party up in here, I'm into it!
Mary: Yeah, it is pretty sweet.
Remy: See? That's– why are you so bummed out? I promise we're not here to hurt you, we came here to try to get some help for you.
Mary: Listen, I appreciate it, but horseshit. I know why you're here, you and your buddies are here from the [mockingly] “Do-Good Fellowship” to kill me, and that's not gonna happen.
Remy: Listen, I've been a superhero for like twenty minutes, but I'm pretty sure we've– there's like an unspoken sort of Batman, no lethal situation. I'm– I don't wanna KILL anybody, Jesus!
Mary: No, listen. Everybody's out to get me, I know they are. Everybody wants to hurt Space Cadet. That's the way it is, that's– and look! Look, I appreciate you giving me my powers back, but I'm not gonna let you, and your two monster girlfriends, kill me. And let me guess, those two backstabbers Addison and Flanagan are with you too, aren’t they?
Remy: Uh, nope, just the three of us. They are complete dipshits though, I’m so glad we’re on the same page there.
Mary: It’s tough when they give you shitty partners, isn’t it?
Remy: I know! It’s- and- and I know exactly what you’re talk-
Griffin: Can I roll Empathy, to try to literally empathize with her right now?
Clint: Yeah. [crosstalk] Yeah.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay. Ah! Yes! [laughter] I rolled a 2 [Justin: Griffin rolled a 2], and I have a +2 in Empathy, and I’m like,
Remy: Yeah, y’know, it seems like there should be a better process, y’know, it’s not like we’re really simpatico, like fully locked into the drift. Uh, that was Pacific Rim. You like that one? That was a good flick.
Mary: That was good. Oh, I love that movie, love it, love it, love it. [crosstalk]
Remy: [crosstalk] It was good. No, I know, it’s out of your control, but I- listen, I know things are rough, but I really don’t mean you any harm.
Griffin: I’m just trying to like, use empathy to like, get her to stop attacking us with robots all the time.
Mary: [sighs] Gah. I don’t know. Y’know it’s just the whole joke. That the Do-Good Fellowship with their twenty four dumbass questions, and, and all the screening–
Remy: Did they do all twenty four when you were there for the initiation? Cause I thought it went a little bit long.
Mary: Ohhhh God. It was a pain in the ass. Whoever came– I guess Ben Franklin, I guess, we can thank Ben Franklin–
Remy: Old pervert.
Mary: [laughs] Oh, absolute– see, you don’t believe in what they’re doing either, do ya?
Remy: Absolutely not. But I do– I’m worried about you, is my main thing right now.
Mary: Oh, no, don’t worry about me I’m gettin’ what I wanted. See, here’s the thing. I had no interest in being a Do-Gooder. All their little tests, and all their little screening, I fooled them all. I want powers. Cause I’m gonna get back to the government for what they did to my mom and dad. My mom and dad were true believers. [trembling] I– they were– you want to talk about doing good? [angrily] They were doing good! And then the government hounded them, with a bunch of trumped up charges, and they– and destroyed their ministry and sent them to prison, took all of this away from ‘em! [laughs] When I– when I went there to get my powers it was just to get revenge on the government. I’m gonna show them a thing or two.
Remy: All right. Well. Um…
[Travis laughs]
Remy: Yeah. I mean, they make bad choices sometimes, this is um, I’m sorry about your folks, that’s a real shame to hear about it, but um… you understand I didn’t do that to you but you’ve been attacking me with robots since we got here so can we call a truce on that and figure out, you know, a way forward here?
Clint: Just then, Mary and Remy both feel that surge of warmth going through them. And Mary says,
Mary: Ohhhhh, there’s that old sweet feeling, your super significant others must be getting closer!
Clint: And we cut back to Nadiya and Kardala.
{26:52}
Griffin: Did Irene— hold on did Irene just turn back into Kardala as soon as that warmth…?
Clint: Not yet. Cutting to that moment when the power is surging through them so she’s still Irene for now.
Irene: Nadiya, listen.
Nadiya: Yes?
Irene: You need to stay outside. I think I can talk to her.
Nadiya: Uh huh…?
Irene: Listen, if you hear me yelling, you rush in and… I don’t know, turn your hand— what were you doing? Like, like putty-?
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Don’t worry about that, rushing in isn’t really my thing?
Griffin: [in background] Hah.
Irene: Mmhmm.
Nadiya: Um… yeah you know what, Nadiya’s good out here.
[Clint laughing]
Irene: Great. Okay um. Okay.
Nadiya: In fact, you know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna kinda walk around the building. [
Irene: Yeah–] See if maybe I can, yeah see if I can find–
Irene: [indistinguishable crosstalk] –science out here.
Nadiya: No, see if I can find another entrance, ya dingus.
Irene: Yeah that’s– that’s good too, yeah. Try to find another entrance!
Justin: Irene walks into the arena.
Clint: Irene comes in, makes an entrance into the arena.
Griffin: I see Irene and I’m like—
Remy: Hey Irene! You’re back!
Clint: And Irene, that warm glow of energy starts kicking in, and Irene can feel herself starting to change as she sees Remy.
Irene: Well shit, this isn’t what Iiiii… [voice deepens and changes]
Kardala: …iii have come to return your horn!
Remy: Oh no.
Kardala: I am going to put it in your chest!
Remy: Kardala, wait, we’re good here, we’re really making progress—
Justin: Kardala’s already storming towards Mary with the horn in hand, brandished like a dagger.
Clint: Aaaand the unicorn charges in between, and intercepts.
Justin: Okay good. Then uh, Kardala buries the horn in the unicorn’s head.
Clint: Awrgh!
Griffin: Now this is a fight.
Justin: I’m putting it on, point down, I’m putting it in backwards! [Clint laughing] It’s a joke!
Clint: Alright!
Justin: That’s a… four. [dice rolling]
Clint: Oh yeah. That’s a zero. Puppy, describe it.
Justin: Uh, Kardala flips up in the air, grabs it point down, jams it in the part where the sparks go.
Clint: And the head just absolutely goes kablooey and down goes the unicorn.
Griffin: Does Nadiya— Does Nadiya hear this happening from outside? I don’t want Travis to be left out. [Clint: Yes.] Does Nadiya hear this from outside.
Clint: Yeah. Nadiya, what do you do?
Travis: I’m investigating for another entrance.
Griffin: Can we roll for that now then? For- [Travis: Yup.] looking for another entrance?
Clint: Alright, do it!
Travis: Damn it! [Griffin: [chuckling] That’s another minus two.] She can’t even find the first entrance!
Griffin: Alright, uh, I get this-
Travis: [crosstalk] Ah- It’s a one- it’s a one total. Um…
Clint: Okay so. How about if you hear noise… you’re approaching the eastern entrance [dice rolling] and you can hear the sounds coming from there, how’s that. Mary’s powers are kicking in to the nth degree, uh that red hair of hers just shoots out, it’s like a halo of fire around her head and she says, um,
Mary: Romans 12:19! Vengeance is mine! I will repay, sayeth the Lord, I told you you had monsters with ya!
Clint: And then, all of a sudden, the ground starts to shake. Loud, tremendous impact. Footsteps coming. And from behind Mary, in the Northern arch, steps a giant Goliath. Fifteen feet high, carrying a spear and a giant shield. The Goliath opens up in the back, this kind of panel opens up, and she climbs inside. Let’s roll for initiative.
[TAZ: Commitment theme fades in at 30:22]
[The Money Zone 30:42-36:20]
Clint: Alright Remy, you go first, again!
Griffin: I say to Kardala,
Remy: You got this, right? You can handle this one?
Kardala: Ha, yes!
Remy: Yeah this seems up your alley. Hey, Batman rules? Don’t kill, okay. The robot is fine but Mary, don’t mortally-
Clint: Just remember your mission.
Remy: Yeah don’t mortally injure her, okay. Can you restrain yourself that much?
Kardala: Yes, I feel that my thirst for battle will be slaked by this giant person.
Remy: Fantastic. I just need you to buy me some time, I have a cunning plan, and I-
Travis: Somewhere, Nadiya shivers. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: I bend my knees and— are there like rafters or some place up high that I can jump up to?
Clint: I would say that the entranceways are pretty high.
Griffin: Yeah I just want to jump up on top of one of the entranceways and sort of get free from battle to do something on my next turn, just sort of- [Clint: Okay.] -get out of the way.
Clint: Do it! Which one do you want, north, south— you don’t want to go north—
Griffin: Uh no, god no, I’ll go uh, I’ll go— I’ll just jump up to the west one I guess.
Clint: Alright.
Griffin: I’m just trying to get out of the battle so that I can— cause what I need to do next is gonna take some time and I won’t be able to do it if I have a big giant attacking me.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: Alright, I’m done. Um… I think next… [Clint: Who goes next?] How about uh, it’s just the Goliath, right? There’s no other enemies in here?
Clint: Right.
Griffin: Let’s just get that turn out of the way.
Clint: The Goliath only sees one target, and that would be Kardala. Sooo the Goliath charges forward, and tries to spear Kardala with, well, the spear. [Justin: Mm.] Uhhhh it kind of gives this inarticulate growl when he does it.
Justin: Great.
Clint: The giant has four in fight, and so… we get a [dice roll] negative one, so that’s three.
Justin: Uh, Kardala ties with a three.
Clint: Okay, the spear glances off of Kardala, [Justin: Mmhmm], Kardala kind of turns sideways, is that alright?
Justin: Sure.
Clint: And the spear tip kind of bounces off of Kardala’s vest. And [Griffin: And-] so it also apparently is spear-point proof.
Griffin: And the giant needs an aspect.
Clint: The energy that the robot Goliath had been planning on using to skewer Kardala, uh is saved up, since they didn’t really make impact.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Since it’s like, charged.
Clint: Yeah.
Justin: So that’s your boost.
Travis: So who’s next?
Clint: Uh I think, uh, Kardala!
Kardala: Yes. Excellent. This is more like it.
[Clint makes growling noises as the Goliath]
Kardala: [laughs] Yes. Rawr. Yes.
Justin: Kardala smacks her hands together. [makes an sound like an explosion] Like that, and creates a sheet of ice underneath the Goliath.
Clint: [laughs] Okay.
Justin: That’s the uh, the weather, she’s freezing the ground beneath the Goliath. [Clint: Alright] Um. Now the way that works for this particular power is, I have to roll- um, it’s- I’m creating advantage using will, um, so I need to roll, and the opposition is generally plus two, that’s two, plus my will, is three so that’s five, so I do create the, uh, sheet of ice beneath the Goliath.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: So the advantage is an aspect?
Justin: It’s an aspect of the environment that I can invoke- [Griffin: Anybody can invoke-] -to, anybody can invoke, correct, yes, thank you.
Griffin: So any of us can use that, next time we do something, which, maybe Nadiya can do now.
Clint: And… I guess Nadiya [Justin: Uhhh] goes next?
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, Nadiya.
Travis: Cool! So, I have come in from the east? Y’know, I’m just gonna both hands together, and like, sledgehammer, um, the back of the Goliath’s legs. [Clint: Mmkay.] So I end up with four, plus the slippery ground, so plus two, it’s a six.
Clint: Nice! Well, the giant, in defending— I guess defense?
Griffin: Uh yes, part [Travis: Uh, yes.] of it is fight, right?
Travis: Yeah. Well no, it’s an act of will, so—
Clint: [crosstalk] But will— will is Nadiya’s fight skill.
Travis: Okay.
Clint: Alright. Uh, it slams into the back of the Goliath’s legs, which knocks him forward on the ice, and the Goliath goes down to one knee, and kinda slides right up against Kardala.
Griffin: He takes some stress for that I imagine?
Clint: Yeah, takes two, as a matter of fact—
Justin: [crosstalk] How do you— how d’you— ‘kay here’s a question, how do you know how much stress—
Griffin: It’s how much- it’s how much Travis beat dad’s roll by. Yeah.
Justin: Ohhh okay.
Griffin: How much— So what did you roll then, with your fight defense?
Clint: Uhhhh four. Total was four.
Travis: [crosstalk] I have a six, so-
Clint: So I took- so the Goliath took two physical stress.
Griffin: Aw, great.
Travis: I’m also going to say, uh, I’m going to self compel my drawback, um which is use of powers’ physically exhausting, use too much of it will cause her physical damage cause I think that was a pretty big hit? To do like a two handed swing against a fifteen foot opponent, so I’m going to say that that also causes me one physical stress.
Justin: Alright and you take a fate point for that.
Griffin: Well if dad approves it.
Justin: Oh yeah.
Clint: Yeah I do approve it. [Griffin: Alright] I like that. Alright we’re back up to Remy!
Griffin: Alright. Here’s my idea. I want to spend a Fate point to establish a thing that is true about the world. That is the other thing you can do with Fate points. And I just want to establish that I have a— I put my thumb into the bag, open up the thumbprint, open up the bag and I reach in and I get out my laptop!
Clint: [laughing] Okay?
Griffin: Uh and I open it up, and I try to find Mary’s signal. [Clint: starts laughing] I assume even if it’s not a wifi signal it’s something that reaches out to electronics and so this is— so this is one of those things and so I try to find Mary’s signal.
Clint: Okay. I say you can find the signal.
Griffin: Okay! I find her signal and then I’m gonna try to DDOS her. [Travis starts laughing]
Clint: Which means?
Griffin: Uh, denial of service attack. It means I’m just gonna kinda flood the signal to a point where it will stop working.
Clint: Okay. [dice rolling] [Griffin: Uh.] Go for it!
Griffin: Okay. I’m assuming this is craft? Cause that’s like what I established as my [Clint: Right.] IT skill? So.
Clint: Well in this case you’re rolling against Mary then.
Griffin: Yeah yeah yeah yeah, for sure.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: Uh-
Justin: [crosstalk] It was not negative.
Griffin: It was not negative. So I have a plus two in crafts, but I have the IT specialist aspect that I can invoke. Uh, so I can spend another [dice rolling] Fate point here. Can I also, uhhhhh… hmm. You can invoke uh- [Travis: So, do that and uh] -you can invoke- [Travis: Find out what-] You can invoke as many things as you want, right?
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah find out what Mary- wait, can we find out what Mary rolled before invoking things?
Griffin: Yeah you can keep adding onto it. So that’s a four, total.
Clint: Alright, Mary has rolled a one, but has four in crafts, so she has five.
Griffin: I mean I think I can also just invoke- uh spend my last Fate point and invoke the ground? The ice on the ground? And then uh say like uh she was too busy sort of keeping her- staying upright? To like, really fend off this attack? Would you give me that? Like she was spending so much bandwidth [Clint: Yeah!] like just trying to stay upright.
Clint: [crosstalk] I’ll give you- no, yeah.
Griffin: I’m burning all of my shit on this one cause I really want it to work so that’s- that brings me up to a six which beats her five.
Clint: So the net outcome is one, correct? In your favour?
Griffin: Yeah, but this isn’t really an attack as much as it’s like, I’m just trying to keep her from being able to control things with her signal.
Clint: I’ll go along with that. And- but you’ve also connected to her, correct?
Griffin: Uh… yeah I guess so, I guess my computer’s connected to Mary.
Clint: And since her power can- is like, communicating with these chips and with technology, she is now linked to your laptop.
Griffin: Do I get an IM from her? Like a AOL instant message message?
Clint: You get a message where she says,
Mary: Are you out of your mind?! Do you know what’s gonna happen if I’m in here and I don’t have control of this thing???
Griffin: I just message back-
Remy: lol
[laughing]
Griffin: Uh.
Clint: Okay, at this point the Goliath rears back. It’s right on top of Kardala, I mean right next to Kardala. Rears back with that shield and hits Kardala with everything it’s got.
Griffin: Yeah can I give it the aspect ‘Out of control’? Just like as- I think that was technically creating an advantage I think the advantage is I remove control from Mary, and so this thing is now out of control.
Clint: Yeah okay.
Justin: Okay.
Clint: Yeah. [dice rolling] And the roll is two, so that’s seven. Hits Kardala for seven.
Justin: Okay? So Kardala has four against that seven. Um. I’m gonna invoke the ice and spend a Fate point to invoke the ice, uh, to add to my roll, which would get me to six, and I’m using the ice to kinda slide away so it doesn’t clobber me [Clint: Okay] directly. [Clint: The impact.] Kardala just kinda flings herself away from the impact, not enough to miss it but-
Travis: She turns it into a skid.
Justin: Yeah exactly, exactly.
Clint: Alright, so, Goliath rears back with that shield, slams it into Kardala, that knocks Kardala back, um, on the ice and away from Goliath and does one physical stress to Kardala. And it’s Kardala’s turn.
Kardala: [laughing] Excellent. Excellent. I haven’t been hurt in so long.
Justin: Well, uh, I have super toughness which gives me two armour, so it didn’t really hurt that bad but—
Griffin: An armour value reduces the shift of a successful hit, so armour two makes any hit worth two less than usual. If you hit, but the target armour reduces the shift value to zero below, you get a boost to use on your target but you don’t do any harm. When you hit— so the armour negates, uh, however much of the shift of the armour, so if you have armour two, then you took that shift down to zero, and when that happens because of armour, then the Goliath gets another boost but doesn’t do any harm. Does that make sense? [Justin: Okay] So the Goliath- so dad needs to give the Goliath another aspect, but you do not actually take any damage.
Clint: I think it’s just going in the, into full berserker mode now, I mean systems are disrupted and- [indistinguishable crosstalk from Justin]
Griffin: So it’s out of control and berserk. So we have a looot of stuff we can use on this Goliath now.
Clint: Okay. Um.
Travis: I like how we keep saying like ‘this Goliath’ to you, [Clint laughs] I think it’s name is Goliath, like David and? Y’know?
Griffin: [very fast] Oh yeah let’s hit him in the fuckin’ someone hit him in the fucking head with a rock!
Travis: Yeah I feel like we’re missing a particular-
Clint: I believe it’s Kardala’s turn.
Remy: Hit him in the head with a rock! It’s a bible thing! The terrible bible! That’s what it says.
Travis: That’s just for-
Justin: In case you missed last episode, Kardala kept calling it terrible like it was strong, not Griffin— Griffin’s not saying the bible is terrible. [Clint laughing] Just want to make that clear here, little editorial note.
Justin: I should throw a rock—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Write it down.
Justin: I suppose. Um. I just grab a chunk of the frozen ground. And uh—
Clint: Snap off a piece of ice?
Justin: Snap off a piece of ice [Clint laughs] and I chuck it at the Goliath’s head. Um. Which I guess would be… physique?
Griffin: Or shoot.
Justin: Shoot. Okay. Uh, I… am going to chuck the ice chunk at him, and I have a uh, a one. I’m going to invoke ‘Out of control’, so that at inopportune moments, because it’s not in control, at an inopportune moment it turns it’s head to look at my attack, and um I add to my one to make it a three.
Clint: The Goliath has three.
Justin: Perfect. Yeah I’ll just go ahead and just leave it as a boost. Kardala is now furious that that dumb idea didn’t work, and she is remorseful that she didn’t just punch it in its face.
Clint: Yeah.
Justin: So that’s my boost.
Clint: Okay, the ice chunk kinda bounced off the side of Goliath’s head.
Remy: Okay never mind that wasn’t— it wasn’t a riddle, my bad.
Clint: Nadiya! [Travis: Yes?] What do you do?
Travis: So now that uh, since the Goliath is still down on one knee, [Clint: Right.] I’m going to attempt to turn one hand into a crowbar and pop open the door that Mary is in, the compartment that Mary is in.
Clint: [laughs] Kay? From the back. Yes.
Travis: Yes. Zero! Super great. Um. Wellll plus… five. Five.
Clint: Alright, the door pops open, Mary is faced away from you because she’s facing forward but she uh, kinda yells back over her shoulder and she’s— you gotta understand something, they are linked. So all this craziness, all this berserkness, is kind of feeding back on her too. And she just turns to you, that hair is still goin’ all over the place, aaand as a matter of fact it’s kinda weird cause the hair has kinda been tangled inside the Goliath, working around all the mechanics of it and all the technology and she just turns and looks at you, and just gives this horrible screeching scream right in your face.
Travis: Oookay? [Griffin laughs]
{50:08}
Clint: Remy.
Griffin: Uh, I wanna do another dumb thing.
Clint: Do it.
Griffin: Since this Goliath was able to be connected to by Mary, I assume I can also try to use my computer to hack the Goliath and take it over.
Clint: You can certainly try.
Griffin: Well, I disconnected him from Mary, right? That was the thing I did with the DDOS attack. And so, I won’t be- I don’t think I would be contesting her, I will be contesting the Goliath.
Clint: So basically you’d be duplicating her superpower with your hacking skills.
Griffin: Uh, I don’t know about that but I just wanna take control of the Goliath with my hacking skills.
Travis: I don’t know about that, but yes.
Griffin: But yes.
Clint: Go for it.
Griffin: Please, god, please. Yes! That is a three with the roll, plus two for my hacking skill.
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: Okay, that’s a three.
Justin: Holy shit.
Griffin: Alright, I got a five.
Clint: Alright, here’s what I’m gonna do, here’s what I will say. Your attempt to take control partially works, and it, basically what happens is even more systems fail, and the Goliath goes down on the other knee still waving his shield and spear.
Griffin: But I don’t have control over him?
Clint: You took control of his legs. I’m not gonna grant you her superpower.
Griffin: Okay, but I have control of his legs.
Clint: Yes.
Griffin: Okay, fantastic.
Clint: Now it’s Goliath. It’s just completely enraged, thrashing around with its arms, takes its spear and jams it back over its shoulder-
Travis: Like a back scratcher.
Clint: Yeah, except it’s trying to get to your back through your front, jabs the spear at Nadiya, and [Travis: Okay.] with the, if I invoke the aspects, and with the roll, that is a six.
Travis: Cool. I have five minus one, so four. Yeah, you know I’m gonna take that hit. I’m gonna take that hit.
Clint: So, it would ordinarily probably with a flesh and blood person, would’ve killed them. But, with your pliable, flexible skin, where do you want it? Where do you want the spear to pierce you?
Travis: I’m just gonna go ahead and take a mild consequence, and maybe get it, like a graze on the ribs?
Clint: Okay.
Travis: You know?
Griffin: So like, bleeding or cut? [crosstalk]
Clint: I think with the two, I think you get pierced. I think he gets pierced.
Griffin: So like stab stabbed, or pierced?
Clint: Stabbed in the ribs.
Travis: Well, so a two consequence is mild, I don’t want any like internal organs pierced or anything.
Clint: Well yeah, but you’ve got this amazing wonder-skin.
Travis: I do, thank you. I moisturize. Okay, yeah I’ll take a piercing without any internal organ damage.
Griffin: A mild piercing.
Travis: A mild piercing, it’s not quite a gauge.
Griffin: So, to explain what just happened Travis did not take physical stress, but instead elected to take a consequence, which is an aspect that dad can use against him in the future.
Travis: Yeah, so my ribs are kinda pierced in a very biblical reference.
Clint: Okay, Kardala–
Griffin: Uh, actually the Goliath stands up. I got it’s legs. [Clint: Okay] And, just runs as fast as fucking possible into a wall.
Clint: I’ll allow it. The goliath jumps up, is very confused, goes and runs smack dab into a wall, and careens back almost to the exact same point.
Griffin: Uh, take some stress for that?
Clint: Yeah, takes two stress.
Griffin: Alright.
Clint: And now it’s Kardala.
Kardala: You are very silly giant, I don’t understand your strategy-
[Clint imitates Goliath growling]
Kardala: Indeed, indeed.
Travis: A Goliath could talk, I mean okay, this is fine. It’s fine.
Justin: Like, I can move in a action right? I can move one zone and have it not count as my action?
Clint: I think in this case, I think any movement you make is justifiable.
Griffin: Yeah, you can move as part of an action. One, one zone.
Justin: Okay so, describe the scene for me as Kardala is seeing it right now cause we’ve been doing a lot.
Clint: Okay, so you’ve got Nadiya hanging off the back trying to get at Mary inside, you’ve got Remy up on the east arch trying to, oh the west arch trying to hack [Griffin: [crosstalk] Just CSI cybering the hell out of this whole situation.] The Goliath ran into a wall, and came bouncing back and is basically standing right in front of you.
Justin: Okay, perfect.
Kardala: I attempted your bible story and it was uneffective. But let it be known that I am a team player. Now, I will read to you from Kardala 1:1
Justin: And I punch it in the stomach. It’s a very active kinetic bible.
Clint: In the beginning, Kardala punched in the stomach [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s more like a workout–
Travis: [crosstalk] You can find more experience than read, really.
Justin: Yeah, that is a four.
Clint: That is a minus three. [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Holy shit-
Griffin: [crosstalk] Hachi machi, that’s a shift of seven.
Clint: [crosstalk] Well, you’d roll a–
Justin: Well no, wouldn’t you add your fight skill to that?
Clint: That would be four, so it’s only one.
Justin: One, okay perfect.
Griffin: You have a boost too, don’t you? [Justin: Oh, yeah.] Yeah, that’s three dog. That’s a three two.
Justin: Oh that’s true!
Kardala: I am also still very angry that your stone throwing didn’t work.
Justin: So I’m adding two to that.
Remy: It’s probably cause you used ice! You gotta use a rock like the bible said!
Kardala: Thank you little man.
Justin: That’s a six, that’s a six.
Clint: Oh, wow.
Griffin: That’s a shift of five. [crosstalk]
Justin: Shift of five.
Clint: Shift of five.
Travis: That’s up into that severe consequence range if you wanna take that? Or…
Clint: I think that’s about all the Goliath can take, and not only does it hit him in the stomach, it goes right into one of those open gaps where because of age and because of deterioration in the machine, it goes right into the machinery. Almost gets to Mary, almost physically gets to Mary, but the force pushes her back even more and shatters what I guess would be the Goliath’s mechanical spine, and those precious legs that Remy wanted so bad.
Remy: My beautiful legs!
Clint: Completely fold up, the Goliath sinks down and starts to fall forward.
Griffin: Nadiya?
Travis: Do I wanna knock Mary out or get her out of Goliath?
Clint: I think that this, what just happened to the Goliath, with the feedback loop and everything else, she’s pretty well knocked out.
Travis: Okay, cool. I’m gonna try something that I wanna see if it works or not. I’m gonna like throw a grappling hook to the, one of the entrances, is there any overhanging bars or anything?
Clint: Yeah, there’s like a great big stone archway over each one of them.
Travis: Yeah, I’m gonna hook down like pull us out, you know? Pull us out of there. [Clint: Alright.] Give myself some leverage.
Clint: Do it!
Griffin: You’re trying to pull her out with-?
{57:15}
Travis: Yeah, I’ve got like the back of her collar, you know, I’ve got like a good grip on her, and I’m like pulling us out. You know? I’m getting us out of there as it falls, as the Goliath goes down, you know.
Clint: Very dramatic.
Travis: Yeah. Very dramatic. And it’s a plus two, so…
Griffin: Yay, Travis’s first positive roll of the day.
Travis: Yay for me! And so, plus two-
Clint: Describe it, describe it.
Travis: So, as the Goliath is going down, throw the grappling hook, grab the back of her collar, and like more than like kinda pulling us out, the Goliath just kinda continues to topple and we, you know, we swing out of it and lower down to kinda lay her out on the ground as the Goliath continues to fall around us.
Clint: And when the Goliath hits the ground, man, I mean it just practically explodes. Parts go flying everywhere, sparks go flying everywhere, and everything is still. You have defeated my Goliath puzzle.
Travis, Griffin, and Justin: Yaaay!
Griffin: Can I- Can I, I think I still have my laptop open and I still have the chat window with Mary, and I think I just chat like type in:
Remy: You still there?
Clint: Nothing.
Griffin: Okay. I think I type in like:
Remy: You’re gonna be okay. I promise we’ll keep you safe. We’re gonna get you some help. I… Just trust us.
Clint: You take Mary, pick her up, and you all trudge back through poor Hallelughland, which is a little looking worse for wear, you pass by John the Baptist head, there’s nothing.
Griffin: I pick up the head, and I’m just carrying the head also. I’m also interested in the head it’s a cool robot head. I’m into that.
Clint: Alright, and you make it back to the skimmer, you punch in the return coordinates, the skimmer-
Griffin: In the skimmer, I take the head and I’m puppeteering with it like-
Remy as John the Baptist: I thought that first mission went pretty good, what do you guys think? I like you guys.
Clint: So you take a few minutes, enjoy a couple of leftover strombolis, the skimmer goes zooming over the Gulf of Mexico, and finally arrives back at the Berg. Following the programming it lands on the landing pad on the- in the security branch, is where it comes down. And, Martin and Sylvane are there waiting for you as you touch down on the pad, you see the first manifestation of Sylvane’s power, he is like super fast, and is just all the sudden, almost like appears right there as you guys come out of the skimmer. And you notice he’s loaded down with these big bodacious knives and bladed weapons. And as he takes Mary off your hands, Martin says:
Martin: Nice work! I approve of the extreme violence! Your debriefing is going to be in the security conference room, just take that elevator right there down to the fifth floor,
Remy: Ah yeah. Elevator.
just go right down the elevator and you can have your debriefing.
Remy: What are you gonna do with her? Cause I did promise that nothing bad was gonna happen, that we were gonna get her some help. She would be safe. Is that- ? You’re not gonna hurt her in any way? You’re just gonna try to help-
Martin: Oh no! She’s one of ours.
Griffin: I’m gonna roll empathy against that just to make sure they’re not lying.
Clint: Yeah, do it.
Griffin: That’s a four.
Travis: You rolled a two, plus two-
Griffin: I rolled a two plus two, that’s four
Clint: One, two-
Travis: Buckle my shoe.
Clint: So that’s a five. (crosstalk)
Travis: You’ll never know.
Griffin: Okay.
Martin: No, I’m telling you. No harm will come to Mary.
Clint: So, you guys grumble about a little bit because you would probably like to have a little break. You go down the elevator to the fifth floor, and you walk into a large, dark room. And there’s like one light in this room, and it’s shining down on a man sitting in a large stone chair in the back of the- well, I say sitting. He’s kinda lounging on it. Very nonchalant. He’s got one leg draped over one of the arms, he’s leaning back on the other arm, and he’s kinda in silhouette, you can’t really make him out. But, he starts to slowclap. And he says, uh:
Man: Amazing! Ha! [slowclaps] You clowns actually pulled it off!
Remy: That’s mean.
Man: Ha ha! Color me impressed, man. Color me impressed.
Travis: It’s probably Benjamin Franklin.
Griffin: Is it Benny Franks?
Man: How are you guys doing? I’m very proud of you, you did a good job for me.
Nadiya: Okay, cause you did say clowns.
Remy: Yeah. Clowns is a little-
Man: Oh, I, that’s just me. That’s just me just fooling around with you, no you’re not clowns at all. You did a spectacular job. Really, I am so proud of you. You really pulled it off. You did better than I expected, how’s that?
Remy: I mean, it’s still kinda-
Nadiya: Fuck off?
Remy: A little underhanded, yeah-
[End music fades in]
Nadiya: Cool, who are you?
Man: My name is Richard! Oh well, that’s my name. Who am I? [chuckles] I’m the fuckin’ king of the USA!

Clint: Alright, to kinda just reset the scene a little bit, you are in this debriefing room in the security branch of the Berg. Also in this room, lounging in a very large, I dunno, throne-like looking chair, is a man who just identified himself as Richard, the king of the USA.
Griffin: I think he said “I’m the fucking king of the USA”. [Clint: [crosstalk] The fucking king.] And that cuss? Should’ve been–
Travis: Hardcore.
Justin: So unnecessary.
Clint: The fucking king of the USA, baby.
Travis: Maybe he said he’s the fuck king of the USA. [laughter]
Justin: Possibly.
Travis: That’s what it says on my license plate!
Clint: I dunno.
Griffin: Um. I think Remy pretty much reflectively responds,
Remy: [disbelieving tone] Nooo you’re noooot.
Richard: Yeah? I understand listen, hey, look. This is a wild concept. But lemme tell ya ma’ story, and.. and then we’ll chat! We’ll have a confab–
Nadiya: No…
Travis: And Nadiya turns to walk out.
Richard: Wait! Hold on, I think you’ll find this interesting. And this is gonna impact everything that comes after this. Okay so we’re gonna start off with a little history lesson, okay? By the way, I got croute up here, I got sparkling water, there’s some shrimps if you guys want to munch on something while we–[crosstalk]
Griffin: I already have a mouthful of shrimp and I say,
Remy: [muffled] What’s croute?
Kardala: I too will eat your shrimp.
Richard: Yeah I asked for stromboli but apparently we’re out. I don’t know what’s the deal there.
Kardala: Yes, I claim the stromboli.
Richard: Okay so, go back in history a little bit. King George the Third, King of England, did’cha know his reign as king was longer than any other monarch before or since in England, sixty years and he was a fighter! He fought lots of wars, he fought in Europe, in Africa and Asia — well, he dispatched armies — but like any good fighter he knew when he was beaten, and in the fall of 1781 he got— he figured it out. He knew he was not going to be able to win
Remy: Hell yeah
Richard: against the American colony.
Remy: America baby, we did it!
Richard: Well it was too expensive! I mean, financially and his reputation, y’know— for five years he couldn’t beat a bunch of scrowdy row farmers in a war? Y’know, other colonies were talkin’ about it, the other crown heads of Europe were talkin’ about it, so Georgie Three was y’know, lookin’ bad to France, to Spain, to all his country club buddies, all the hoi polloi. So King George the Third decided he’d make a last ditch, hail Mary play to hold onto his rep. He realised he was probably gonna take a check in the loss column, but maybe he could put an asterisk next to it.
Richard:August 12th, 1781, he signed a royal decree naming a regent over the Americas, basically named a king to rule. But he did this in secrecy, and in secrecy, he had that decree immediately dispatched to America on his fastest ship. But don’t matter how fast your ship is, the Atlantic Ocean? Not a good collaborator. So it didn’t show up until October 26th, that was one week after General Cornwallis surrendered to George Washington in Yorktown! Which basically made the American colonies a free state— but not really.
Remy: Should I be taking notes on all this?
Richard: Oh no no no no no, noooo, just let it work on you, let the story wash over ya,
Remy: Okay.
Richard: ‘kay. Now, people forget, it was almost a year of negotiations with England! Negotiating the peace! And those negotiations were headed up by the very man who was in fact, the new king of this country. And that is Ben Franklin. Ben Franklin was named the king of the colonies. And it makes sense, for most of his life, Ben really considered himself to be an Englishman. As a matter of fact for like, ten years he was in England and before the war started he argued for colonial independence, so he was loved in all of Europe.
Travis: Uh, side note, Clinton. This is Travis speaking, not Nadiya. How much of this is real to actual historical fact, and how much is Dad’s game bullshit.
Clint: Well, the royal decree is, could have happened.
Travis: Ahhh, right.
Griffin: Ah right, hey, second question follow up— are you uhhhh… Illuminati? Maybe? A little bit?
Justin: Just, you will have to tell us if you’re Illuminati.
Griffin: You legally have to tell us.
Travis: You mean dad, or the character?
Justin: I think dad.
Griffin: Uh right now, dad.
Justin: Yeah right now dad. Dad?
Clint: I’m really not allowed to tell you if I’m Illuminati, boys.
Travis: Ah right. Okay.
Justin: And that’s a confirmation. [Griffin wheezes]
Richard: Alright and so, when the document finally got to Ben, he was torn, didn’t know what to do. Uh but he really thought that this young country would have a better chance of survival as a democracy so he never told his wife. And he never told his son William. He was a bastard by the way, don’t know if you knew that or not.
Nadiya: Hey that’s not very nice.
Remy: Yeah that’s kinda mean. He’s a kid.
Richard: But Ben did tell his grandson, Temple was his name. Also a bastard. Y’know, Game of Thrones didn’t invent this shit. It was Temple who kept all of this going. And down through the ages, it passed from grandparent, to grandchild. And that was the legacy of the King of the USA. With a bloodline leading all the way to—
Remy: Dick.
[brief pause]
Richard: To Dick!
Nadiya: To King Dick.
Richard: King Dick! I love that! Don’t you? Don’t you love that? King Dick the Third?
Remy: I don’t think I can overstate how much I don’t love it. I— I— this is, this is great, and all, very National Treasure Book of Secrets 2, I just— it doesn’t confer any special powers right?
Justin(?): Yeah it’s not really how it works, like, at all.
Nadiya: I’m queen of Belgium, like, it— it doesn’t—
Remy: One time I was—
Nadiya: Once everybody kind of agrees on it, it’s…
Remy: One time in middle school I won the state spelling bee and I got a sash that said ‘Best Speller in the State’ on it, but I don’t— I’m not still the best speller in the state and it didn’t give me any sort of like, control of an army, y’know what I mean? It’s just a title.
Richard: Oh no yeah, it’s a title but that’s what my family has done, down through the generations.
Kardala: Irene’s grandmother once gave her a star. She did not claim the star. She never visited her star. It’s like that, yes.
Remy: It’s a lot— yes it’s a great example.
Richard: Yeah, those are great points. But the key is the Do-Good Fellowship has been doing great things for hundreds of years. And it’s an example of what can be accomplished under, well, basically my leadership. Let me give you an example, I understand your concerns, I understand your fears, but I, and my descendants before me, we really believe in this. We’ve made all this money— y’know, Ben didn’t believe in patents. He said that if you invented something then it’d be shared with everybody. Temple didn’t agree with that. And so, he has a reign— he arranged things, and all through history, that’s what my family has been doing. Do you know that Ben was the first US Postmaster?
Remy: Yes
Richard:Postmaster General of the United States.
Remy: [crosstalk] I did know that
Richard:The first one.
Nadiya: Yeah, even Remy knows that.
Remy: Yeah I knew that.
Richard: And it was— but what you didn’t know is—
Remy: Is he’s the secret king of America.
Richard: As a reward to Ben Franklin and his descendants, it was decided that a tenth of every penny of every stamp minted would go to the Franklin family.
Nadiya: How did they cut that up, I mean—
Remy: Yeah, how are you going to spend a little sliver of metal—
Nadiya: Just this little wedge of a penny—
Richard: Savings. Oh! Oh you’re taking me literally, I understand.
Nadiya: Yeah it was a joke. I don’t know if that— was that clear?
Remy: Yeah we do jokes here.
Richard: We invented bitcoin too, so.
Remy: Are you asking us to be subjects to your secret monarchy? Is that the sort of, tldr here?
Richard: I’m glad you called the question. Tonight is my first big step towards assuming the throne. I would like you guys to be on my side in this. You’ve seen what we can do, you’ve seen what the Do-Good Fellowship can accomplish, you see the technical breakthroughs we’ve come up with, and everything else, and… I would like to know if you guys are with me, or against me.
Remy: If we choose the latter are you going to— is it gonna turn into this sort of a kill-on-sight situation in here or what’s the deal there.
Richard: Oh! No!
Remy: Richard…
Richard: If you decide— No! If you decide that you don’t want to do it, we call a deal a deal, you go see Mr Garfield in the finance department [someone snickers], you get your last pay checks, and it’s, thanks!
Nadiya: Um
Richard: Listen, listen! This is not a military coup, this is not a revolution or anything like that—
Clint: Just then there’s a voice that you hear behind you in the room.
Unknown person: Alecksa. Play ‘Royal playlist M’.
Clint: And Tears for Fears’ “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” starts to play.
Remy: It’s a good jam. A little on the nose.
Clint: Richard says,
Richard: Damn you do love that song, my love. Oh, by the way guys I think you’ve met the royal consort, Martine?
Clint: And Martine walks into the room, and stands next to Richard.
Remy: Is Martine the one that threatened us with a gun while we were getting our spray tan?
Martine: I was just doing my job, fellas, head of security, you know that.
Nadiya: Oh the one I— I’ve hit, with like a cinderblock or a hammer—
Remy: Do you mind? Can we— we’re kind of a package deal I guess, do you mind if we confer for a little bit?
Richard: Oh absolutely, this is what it all comes down to. The time has come for you… to show your commitment. The greatest president— although I’m not really that big a fan of the title— John Adams said, “There are only two creatures of value on the face of the Earth, those with the commitment, and those who require the commitment of others.” You know, we’re talking like commitment to a friend, commitment to a lover, commitment to a family, commitment to an organisation, to a government, to an ideology… I just want to know if you three — Remy, Nadiya, Kardala, Irene if you’re in there — If you are committed… to me! I’m gonna leave you guys alone, Martine and I are gonna leave you alone, let you talk about it a little bit. When you’ve made up your minds, just tell Alecksa, and she’ll give you instructions.
Remy: D’you—
Richard: I gotta go, Martine and I gotta get ready. Okie dokies?
Remy: Sounds good, thanks,
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Great, great, great
Remy: thanks a lot. Mmhmm.
Richard: Alright, you guys.
Nadiya: Bye!
Remy: Yeah have a good one!
Kardala: Bye weirdos!
Remy: See ya, okay, yeah bye byebye bye.
Clint: And they walk out the door.
Remy: [urgently] Okay hey we need to get the fuck out of here right.
Nadiya: Yeah, yeah.
Kardala: It would seem, yes.
Remy: Okay cause w-what do you say to um, all of that, great, but secret king of America I don’t— this guy seems pretty dangerous.
Nadiya: Okay listen it’s not that I super, duper love our current government, or—
Remy: No it’s whack.
Nadiya:with governments in general, but as soon as someone starts talking about like, I’m the secret king of America and ascend the throne or whatever, it starts to kind of cross outside the realm of y’know, normalcy and logic and into the realm of okay, bye!
Remy: Also, Martine did threaten us with guns when we didn’t really do anything.
Nadiya: Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Remy: So I’m worried about what sort of— where they—
Nadiya: I mean she’d fit in well leading America right now but.
Remy: [despondently] Sure. Uh, Kardala, how’re you feeling.
Kardala: Kardala serves no man.
Remy: Yeah.
Kardala:This should not come as a surprise.
Remy: And it doesn’t.
Nadiya: Yeah yeah that’s fine.
Kardala: I serve no one. But —
Nadiya: The rhythm.
[sputtering and laughter]
Kardala: Kardala, and Irene, we are bound. Kardala serves no one, but I am bound to you two. I care not for the king. I care not for the president. I care not for anything other than you two because we are bound and without you, I am forced back into the intolerable prison of Irene, which is a fate I shall not pursue. You have my support.
Nadiya: You old softie.
Kardala: It is not, I should make clear, an emotional decision for me.
Remy: Fantastic.
Kardala: If the two of you were to die and be replaced by others in different shapes and personages and personalities, and different looks and different everything, Kardala would still feel the same. I still—
Remy: [crosstalk] No no no, yeah—
Nadiya: [crosstalk] No no no, we get it.
Remy: We’re still workin’ on this thing.
Kardala: If you do die, is there a plan to replace you as soon as humanly possible? [someone holding back laughter in the background] This is my worry. If we lose this ‘Do-Good Fellowship’, and one of you two were to die and I would be, of course, inextricably locked in the prison of Irene, never to return,
Remy: Right. Right.
Kardala: that would be a problem for me.
Remy: Sure.
Nadiya: Yes.
Remy: I mean Kardala brings a good point, if we take off we might lose these powers? I’m not exactly sure how this works.
Nadiya: If I may. Let us approach this logically. If we leave, we abandon all influence of the situation. If we remain, and say yes, we are not bound by law to do anything.
Remy: Oh hell yeah dude sedition time! Is that what you’re—
Nadiya: That’s exactly what I’m saying. We could do more from the inside than the outside.
Remy: Oh once— hey hold on one second. Alecksa?
Alecksa: Yes?
Remy: You’re not like recording all this, are you?
Alecksa: I don’t know, maybe? [crosstalk] You don’t know how I work—
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Okay delete the last—
Griffin: Um. I go over and unplug the Alecksa machine, if there is one.
[Clint laughing]
Kardala: Wait. Plug it back in for a moment.
Griffin: Okay I plug it back in.
Kardala: We were just kidding. Ha! Another fine joke from you two. I can’t wait to serve… this… great king.
Remy: Yes. Very powerful and just.
Nadiya: Ha ha ha.
Griffin: Okay so Alecksa— I’m just gonna unplug it.
Kardala: Did you see? Subterfuge!
Nadiya: Yeah you did great.
Remy: That was very good, you’re the royal spies! Let’s… I guess tell them that we’re in?
Kardala: You get me? I didn’t mean it!
Remy: Yes
Nadiya: Uh huh.
Kardala: We won’t serve the king, you see. It was a joke! A joke I played on the robot.
[Clint snickering in the background]
Nadiya: Yup.
Remy: Alright. So. Let’s. It might get tough. Like, we don’t really know what we’re going up against, and to be frank I don’t really know why I’m going up against this, it’s just sort of like this—[crosstalk] gut feeling, and—
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Well, let’s take stock, alright? You have like, you can jump real good, and punch real good.
Remy: Mm.
Nadiya: I can turn my body into weapons, and Kardala is a god.
Kardala: Thank you.
Nadiya: So I think we’re cool.
Remy: Alright.
Griffin: Uh, I plug Alecksa back in.
Remy: Uh Alecksa, we’re down to clown.
Alecksa: Step out into the lobby, and follow the 24 question mark logo.
Nadiya: [muttering] Oh god.
Remy: Alright.
{16:44}
Clint: So you step out into the hallway and there is a big, projected 24 question mark logo, and it leads you down the hallway. It leads you from the security wing into the very central hub of, of the Berg. Um, you have not been in this particular area before. It’s a very large chamber. It’s a large chamber that is similar to the installation room you were in before, in the fact that it’s cut in half by a very large glass wall with a door in the middle of it. In the far side is a raised platform, a big square platform in the far side, in the far half, with a 24 question mark logo on it, and on this side of the door, you have three of your friends— well, co-workers that you remember from the mixer. Sylvane, the security guy who is carrying two very large knives. [crosstalk] Also—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Great.
Travis: [crosstalk] Is that his superpower, he can have two knives?
Griffin: Knife-haver.
Clint: You will find out soon, ho— well, maybe not. Maybe you won’t find out soon. Uh, another male, Lid, and, uh, Jaime, who you’ve also met. And they’re all geared up in their vests, and ready to go. But in front of them, between you and them, stands Richard. King Dick wannabe. Smiling, his arms spread wide, and he says,
Richard: Alright, my friends, have you made your decisions?
Kardala: Yes! We’re very excited to serve you, a real king.
[Griffin laughs a little]
Richard: Excellent! What about you guys?
Kardala: It may seem
Nadiya: Oh, god.
Kardala: like we are too excited.
Nadiya: [crosstalk] Yup! Yup, yup, yup, yup, we are in.
Remy: [crosstalk] Yes, yes, super excited, super excited.
Nadiya: [crosstalk] We are in. Super in. To-totally.
Richard: Well, I want to make sure—
Remy: [crosstalk, interrupting] Ah, ah, ah— My liege.
Richard: [thrilled laughter] Ah ha ha ha, I love it! So all three of you are in?
Kardala: We had no hesitation, [more laughter in background] so glorious was your vision. We are— we are so excited to serve you, a real king.
Richard: That is what I—
Nadiya: Yep.
Richard: I— see, I told you, this is gonna work. I told ya!
Clint: And he’s calling back through the open door to Martine, who’s standing there,
Richard: I told you this was gonna work, I told you they’d be on board. Excellent. Ok. We’re about ready to get started. Um, I tell you what, since you’re the most fervent and the most excited, Kardala, I want you to come with me and help me out with the next phase of this plan. And you, you guys, y’know just, Nadiya, Remy just chill out here for a while with uh, your buddies, with Lid and them. Kardala would you come with me? Just into the- into the next half of the room?
Kardala: No, my king! No! [Clint laughs] Thank you for your kind guidance, my king!
Richard: Well I could really use your help, and as your king, I’m kinda making it a royal decree.
Travis: Nadiya just makes eye contact with Kardala and like, kinda nods a little bit, like, nnngh just, go.
Remy: Hey my liege this is-- and I’m-- your royal authority is just beautiful, and uh, the chosen one and all that, but it does feel a little-- it’s-- there’s a bit of like a sort of a trap vibe...? If I’m being totally honest and like to-- we said we’re down, I don’t really know… why [crosstalk] we’re in this situation–
Richard: [crosstalk] I understand, no no no no– [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Uh, Nadiya turns both of her hands into blades and points them at Kardala and [Griffin: Woah] uh, and Remy and says,
Nadiya: How dare you question the king!
Kardala: Yes, you are right, I do love the king, and everything he says is… so grand. And I will come with him, I just need… these two to come with me. I’m like, their king. Uh, I--
Remy: A sub-king [crosstalk] situation.
Kardala: [crosstalk] You’re my king, and I’m sort of their king. I think-- If I understand [crosstalk] the relationship.
Richard: [crosstalk] That’s cool, that’s fine! That’s-- you know what, let’s all go into the the other half.
Kardala: Yes.
Richard:Everybody, come on, everybody come in there, I want you to see what’s up, because… I think you still aren’t completely convinced. I know you’ve agreed to be on my side, so let me tell you what’s going on. Like I said, there’s no-- there’s no coup, there’s no blood, this is gonna play out in the court of public opinion. I am going to debate, and everybody in the country is gonna watch. I’m just gonna lay my case out there, get the public behind me like I convinced you three…
Remy: Mmhmm.
Nadiya: Yes.
Richard: Not attacking anybody, not hurtin’ anybody,
Remy: Uhm.
Richard: but I just need one of you, somebody who is plugged into their humanity I guess, to serve as, as my… debator! We’re gonna debate this! And I need one of you to debate me!
Griffin: Is there a roll I can do to like, get a feel for Dick’s… [crosstalk] in--
Travis: [crosstalk] Is there an insight?
Griffin: There’s an empathy roll, but I don’t know if that’s necessarily it.
Clint: Who has the highest empathy among the three of you?
Travis: Ha, fuckin’ Irene.
Justin: Right.
Griffin: We could-- I have two, I have two empathy, I could take a-- I could take a swing at it.
Clint: Alright.
Griffin: No. [Clint starts laughing] I got a negative--
Travis: No that’s a negative--
Griffin: [crosstalk] Wait a minute. [Travis: Mmhmm] You have to contest it with deceive, or rapport, if you’re telling the truth, but--
Clint: I tell you what, um, you get a read from Richard that he’s sincere! That he’s honest! This is really what he feels!
Remy: He seems to be level… Uh uh Richard, my liege, my king, uh my lord. Do you… think that if uh you go public with this right now we’re gonna have the, y’know, the marines or something on-- on top of us by like, the end of the hour.
Richard: Well, trust me we’ve thought about that. This? This base, the Berg, is completely defensible. Trust me, and if things work out the way I think they are, we’re not gonna need very long.
Remy: Let’s just kind of see how this plays out.
Clint: From the other room, Martine says:
Martine: Dick, honey. Time to go, we gotta get started.
Travis: His name is Dick Honey?
Clint: No it’s actually Dick Poer, Richard Poer [Travis: Oh. Oh I see.] Poer-
Travis: Like poor Richard!
Griffin: [completely exasperated] Oh come on-- Ohhh, gooooosh.
Travis: I see!
Richard: Come on in, guys, come on, come on, everybody come on in the room.
Clint: So everybody goes into that half of the room. And I’m moving icons here, so you don’t freak out--
Justin: [crosstalk] Awwww here goes!
Griffin: You have to like, set it as the [Clint: Got it] active page, there we go, got it
Travis: Ohhhh there we are!
Clint: Got it wrapped up.
Justin: Eeeeyah, yabba yabba.
Griffin: Well this is a… this is a helpful m-
Travis: It doesn’t seem like a welcoming room…?
Clint: Alright, right off the bat, you notice something. On the far side of the raised platform, Richard is now standing on the raised platform. There is a-- a large chair. And seated in that chair, is… Mary Sage, Space Cadet. And standing next to her on either side, are two men, and they are operatives you remember from the mixer that weren’t total jerks-- Addison, and Flanagan. Also in this general area is another operative named Grey, who I don’t think you’ve encountered yet. Richard steps up onto the raised platform, and says,
Richard: Kardala! Come on, we’re getting ready to get started.
Kardala: Yes.
Clint: So Kardala goes up onto the raised platform with Richard. Martine turns and looks at Flanagan, who raises a hand in the air, and suddenly this black energy surrounds Flanagan. And Flanagan places a hand on Addison’s shoulder, and that black energy seems to flow through, through Addison, into Mary Sage. And Mary’s thing of her hair starting to wave up, her eyes lighting up, she is powering up. But she’s powering up like never before. Her powers are, incredibly enhanced. And Richard turns to you and says,
Richard: See? This is how I’m gonna talk to everybody.
Remy: You couldn’t get a fuckin’ webcam or something my dude?
Richard: I did-- that wouldn’t ensure that everybody would see this. This is gonna show up on every screen, in every digital readout, in every computer, in every game, anything with a chip in it, hell it might even show up in somebody’s microwave oven I don’t know! But this message is gonna go to every. Body. Courtesy of Mary’s power, enhanced by these two! Is that not awesome!
Nadiya: I mean yeah, actually like, yeah.
Remy: When you’re done doing your thing can I just put my mixtape out there?
Richard: [laughs uproariously]
Remy: Hey!
Richard: Oh, that’s a great idea. I wish we had, eh I don’t know if we can do sound.
Justin: So Addison’s a conduit, Flanagan creates--
Clint: The energy.
Justin: The energy, okay--
Clint: And it goes into Mary.
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Got it okay.
Travis: So they are three operatives, they are three--
Clint: They are three operatives, correct.
Travis: Okay.
Clint: So. Richard looks up, and says,
Richard: Alecksa? Play ‘Royal Fanfare 1’.
{26:18}
[Music plays]
Clint: And he says,
Richard: [grandly] Friends! I am your king.
Remy: Big bold start.
Richard: Richard Poer! King Dick. Ha!
Justin: Public opinion.
Richard: And I am here to pass along a very important message to you. This nation has outgrown its’ method of choosing its’ leaders. [Music ends] Think about this. Every four years, sometimes eight years, this country is bitterly divided. Every four years a new person steps into the leadership of this country, and has to reinvent the wheel! Reforge alliances! Restate his or her vision! I believe in vision, not di-vision.
Nadiya: [under her breath] Gross.
Richard: Let me bring everybody together. I am the legal, rightful king of the United Sovereignty of America. Alecksa? Attach the file ‘Visual of the royal decree’?
Justin: Dad you assume at this point everyone thought they were getting viral marketing for a new Kingsman movie and are already trying to close it. [laughter]
Griffin: Yeah!
Justin: You have to assume.
Clint: Can’t close it. [Justin: [crosstalk] Can’t close it.] Can’t close it. Nuh uh. [clears throat]
Richard: I want to provide the leadership to you, that will make this country not only the most powerful country on the planet, but the best country in the planet, doing great stuff like the Do Good Fellowship has done, for years! I want you to show the same courage that those scrowdy row farmers showed! I’m not talkin’ about a revolution, I’m not talking about a coup, I’m talking about replacing a CEO! What if you had to change the boss to the business every four years? And start all over again? No violence, no bloodshed, just me providing a vision. Kardala! Tell ‘em what we’re talkin’ about!
Kardala: … Yes. My name is Kardala, and I love this excellent king. For many… minutes, I have served [Griffin laughing loudly in background] him, and he has always shown himself to be the king… of… America. And… I am very excited about how much I love this great king, and um, this is not a joke. Or a trick.
Richard: Uh good try, good try. Right now, uh, my head of information tech is uploading a file to each one of you listing all the amazing things the Do Good Fellowship has done for the last couple of centuries.
Clint: And Potts pushes a button in his operating station.
Richard: From our R&D department comes a list of all the marvelous scientific innovations we have initiated.
Clint: And Joe pushes a button.
Richard: Medical breakthroughs!
Clint: Grey pushes a button.
Richard: New techniques in finance!
Clint: Mr Garfield pushes a button.
Richard: International relationships!
Clint: Scully pushes a button.
Travis: Dance moves!
Richard: [laughing] Look at all these attachments go. Recipes! This is what I am offering! This kind of leadership from an organisation that believes in me and what I stand for, that a king would be the best thing for this country.
Clint: And at that moment, Mary Sage starts to scream.
Remy: Hey, hey hey hey!
Clint: Mary Sage is completely surrounded by this quivering black energy, and she screams again. And you see blood coming out of her nose. Addison says,
Addison: Uhhh… boss? I-it’s too much for her! I-i-i-i-i-i-i think it’s waaay too much for Mary!
Justin: Kardala looks into the camera and says,
Kardala: America. Meet your king. You have met him, and you know his great wisdom. Now, behold your god.
Justin: And then tackles Addison.
Clint: Okay. [dice rolling]
Travis: Nadiya is also ready to-- like, Nadiya has just been watching Kardala this whole time and kind of counting down an imaginary countdown in her head like--
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, sure.
Clint: Mmhmm. Alright so [dice rolling] you move to tackle her, okay.
Justin: Uh that’s a… four. Which in the Fate ladder is great! Great tackle from Kardala.
Clint: A great tackle from Kardala. As Kardala starts to make the move towards Mary… Sylvane moves. And… with super speed, which is his power, places himself between Mary and Kardala. Kardala tackles Sylvane, and Sylvane’s momentum carries Kardala off the platform, and off to the uh left side, off to the floor. He takes two in physical stress, and a mild consequence that his uh, ankle, is kinda dinged up. He can still move, but he can’t move very fast--
Justin: [crosstalk] The injured ankle, that’s his aspect--
Griffin: [crosstalk] Owie owie owie, owie on the ankle.
Clint: He’s got an owie. He’s got a big owie.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Oh my goodness.
Clint: Richard says,
Richard: Woah, woah woah woah woah waait a minute waaaait a minute there’s no need, no need for that, let-- let-- y’know, if it’s, if it’s killin’ Mary, let’s shut it down, and we’ll-- we’ll y’know, we’ll finish this later. We kinda made our case already.
Clint: And Martine takes her gun out, and points it at Mary’s head, and says,
Martine: I… don’t think so sweetheart. I think we need to finish this.
Griffin: Um. I say,
Remy: Well this sure didn’t last very long.
Griffin: And I jump at Martine to try to interrupt this hostage situation. [Clint: Awesome.] I mean if this thing is popping off we may as well do this. Uhhh I got a five on my athletics roll.
Clint: Okay. [dice roll]
Griffin: I’m not trying to like tackle or like, injure in any way, I’m just literally trying to uh jump, jump into her to keep-- keep, to-- to cool this situation a little bit.
Clint: And as you’re coming down on her, her eyes flash red because she too is augmented with stimplants.
Griffin: Fantastic, fantastic.
Clint: Her eyes flash, and heat beams come out of them.
Remy: Son of a-- no, this sucks!! This is bullshit!!!
Clint: They just barely-- they miss you, but she does shoot heat beams out of her eyes.
Remy: Damnit.
Clint: Nadiya, what do you do?
Travis: Uh, well while this is going on, Nadiya walks up calmly, turns her hand into a knife and puts it to Richard’s throat.
Clint: [laughing slightly] Okay?
Nadiya: Martine, I think we’re done.
Clint: Let’s say, let me think here for a second, gimme a second, I did not expect this.
Travis: Yeah I can roll to intimidate.
Clint: Do a roll to intimidate!
Travis: Oh, sorry, I said intimidate, and then, I realised there is no intimidate in Fate. [Clint laughs] It’s uh, um, I believe what I meant to say was provoke, um, so plus five provoke. And I am attempting to create an advantage by, uh, invoking, or provoking, an emotional state from the target, and the target opposes with will.
Griffin: So what did Martine roll on the will roll. Did uh, [crosstalk]
Clint: Martine… [dice rolling] uh… pl- uh zero, and Martine’s…
Justin: You gotta talk into the mike.
Clint: Sorry.
Justin: Yup.
Travis: These mikes, when do we start using them?
Justin: Our last dad was a radio professional, so it’s [Clint laughs] hard for us to keep up with our new dad.
Clint: Uh, plus one on that roll. So… [Griffin: [crosstalk] What’s the-] you successfully provoke her.
Griffin: What’s the emotional aspect that you have put.
Travis: I would like to, uh, create an advantage with hesitant?
Clint: Okay. Ummm. Just, y’know, she’s got a gun pointing at Mary…
Griffin: Aww she’s got heat eyes and it seems redundant to also have guns, but.
Travis: Well I just want to create a little, just some hesitation there to be invoked later.
Clint: Alright. I like that. That’s good, there’s a little hesitation there. She isn’t quite sure. So. She uh, she powers down her eye beams, and says,
Martine: You-- you really wouldn’t hurt him. He’s an innocent, he’s a--
Nadiya: Oh.
Martine: He’s a good man!
Nadiya: I really would.
Remy: She super would, trust-- trust me on this one.
Nadiya: I super, duper would.
Martine: Alright. Okay, well we’ll… up the ante a little bit.
Clint: And she turns to Mary, and she says,
Martine: Mary, shut down all electronics in the United States of America.
[TAZ: Commitment theme fades in at 35:03]
[The Money Zone 35:23-41:40]
Martine: Mary, shut down all electronics in the United States of America.
Richard: [horrified] Martine! You’d-you’d be cutting off power to- to hospitals! And-- and-- and and vehicles and, stoplights and, people depending on technology to live! You’re gonna kill a lot of people like that’s not what I want!
Clint: Martine says,
Martine: I don’t think so. I love you Dick, but I just don’t think you had what it takes to follow it through.
Remy: Uh Mary, belay that order? Don’t-- don’t do that. Please, that’s-- you don’t want to be responsible for that.
Nadiya: Um, Onyx, Conduit, are you just, like, cool with this?
Remy: You cool with that guys, you two are just super cool with it?
Clint: Onyx is so deep in concentration summoning all this energy, but Addison says,
Addison: Paaah, no, not really, I gotta, I got a really bad feeling about this.
Nadiya: Yeah!
Remy: [simultaneously] No kidding!
Nadiya: Yeah she just said she was gonna shut off all electronics, it’s not a feeling!
Clint: And Mary screams again.
Remy: Alright, Addison, you better let go, or I’m gonna, I swear to god I’m gonna come at you, like a fuckin’ tiger. [snorting in background] This is not a joke. Let go right now.
Clint: Addison says,
Addison: Maaaaaan, I don’t think I can! I-
Remy: Alright! I did-- I just straight up though, just, just right now, you understand, I did give you a fair warning.
Griffin: And I jump at Addison now. [Clint: Okay.] I’m just gonna fucking like, ping pong around the room I guess, jumping on whoever needs to be. [background giggling] Uh, uh…
Travis: Jumped.
Griffin: Jumped at. Uh, and this one is gonna be a fight roll.
Clint: Okay. Roll it. [dice rattling]
Griffin: Uh that’s gonna be… a... one plus five, a six.
Travis: Hooo!
Justin: Wait you-- wait your fight’s five?
Griffin: It’s a three plus with my natural weapon, [crosstalk] that’s two.
Justin: Oh, cool. Neat. Okay.
Griffin: I’m just trying to knock hi-- I’m not trying to, like. I’m not trying to [Clint: Alright.] punch to hurt him? But uh my punch is uh, sort of pass on this kinetic force. I’m going to knock, [Clint: Alright] knock Addison as far away from Mary as I possibly can.
Clint: Describe it.
Griffin: Uhhh I leap off of Martine, uhh and kind of fly over Mary and with my knees up, uh…
Travis: Oh like Ong-Bak style.
Griffin: Ong-Bak style, [Travis: Yeah.] I collide with Addison, and uh, right as I, right as I hit Addison I sort of extend my palms and this wave of force shoots out and uh, knocks them across the room.
Clint: [laughs] ‘Kay.
Justin: Presumably, cause we don’t know what Addison’s, uh, opposition that was.
Clint: Yeah, it was a negative one, so.
Justin: Hachi machi.
Clint: Yeah, you-- you not only knock Addison down and away, but he goes flying. And… I--
Griffin: That’s seven, that is-- I did hit Addison for seven points of stress. [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Non-lethal. Non-lethal.
Clint: [crosstalk] And I think you knocked him out, you didn’t just knock him all the way, you knocked him out.
Remy: I’m so sorry that was waaaay more, waaay harsher than I thought it was gonna be, still gettin’ used-- he’s unconscious. Okay. Well!
Justin: You can also add an added benefit on top of that Griffin, since you succeeded with style.
Griffin: Uhhhh oh yeah! So… uhhhh…
Justin: You have to add an aspect to the situation.
Griffin: You can add an aspect-- yeah, so. But I actually get a, uh uh special effect, which is the thing that each of our characters have. Uhhh you add an aspect to the target which you can invoke once for free, or you can move up to two zones for free. So I’m gonna say, I’ll take extra movement and just like, after I collided with him, I do a perfect backflip through the air and, and am standing right next to Martine, again.
Clint: [laughs] Alright. Martine, her eyes flare up again… [crosstalk] and--
Griffin: [crosstalk] Is Mary is Mary is, uh.
Clint: Mary’s head kinda slumps forward, and…. And uh, Onyx is still summoning energy but there is no longer a conduit. But Mary’s power is still activated, it’s not as powerful as it was, but her hair’s still extended and you can tell that she’s still got her power but her head is kinda slumped forward, uh, in pain and in exhaustion. Matter of fact, she has taken three physical stress, um, because of, because of all the things that were going on. [Griffin: Okay.] Um. [dice roll] Martine fires a heat blast from her eyes at Nadiya. Uhhh one, two. Uhhh has five in shoot, so one, two, she shoots the heat beams effectively at Nadiya. Nadiya what do you do.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: So you’d have to defend with athletics again, shoot.
Travis: Yes, so! That’s a plus one to athletics, and my athletics is plus one, [Griffin: [whispering] Yikesss] so that’s a two, versus what was it?
Griffin: A… seven?
Travis: Was it? What?!
Griffin: It was pretty freaking good.
Clint and Travis: Well.
Travis: I’m going to use, uh, Collateral Damage. If an attack is going to hit, rather than me becoming denser, you can decrease your mass so that the attack passes through you, but! [Griffin: Uh oh.] The attack will continue on and damage another target.
Justin: [wheezes] Ohhhh nooooooo.
Travis: So sorry Richard! Byeee!
Griffin: Ohhhhh shit!
Clint: Okay. Who’s the other target?
Travis: Richard.
Griffin: I mean it’s gonna, you knew it was gonna be Richard, right dad?
Clint: It smashes into Richard, because you are intangible. Alright?
Travis: Uh huh.
Clint: It knocks him away from you, knocks him off the platform, aaaand he is really fucked up. He is-- [Travis: Yeah.] his clothes are on fire. [Travis: Aww yeah!] Uhhh he’s screaming--
Griffin: I say I say,
Remy: Martine! Why did ‘chu do that? Woah!
[laughing]
Clint: Um. And Martine just wigs out. Just absolutely wigs out. Raises her gun, her eyes flash, aaand she’s just gonna bring down seventeen kinds of hell on all you guys. That’s when Mary looks up and looks at Martine, and says,
Mary: You! Shithead! You were gonna make me kill thousands of people!
Justin and Griffin: [simultaneously] Probably millions. [laughing]
Justin: Right. Probably.
Mary: Probably millions! Screw you!
Clint: She squints her eyes, and there’s this humongous tremor, that runs through the entire room. Hell, runs through the entire Berg! Instantly, the twelve branches that house the different departments separate from the central hub and start to submerge. And the central hub is rocked by this. It was never designed for all of the branches to separate and become, distinct vehicles or whatever, at the same time. And… things start goin’ to that seventeen kinds of hell all of a sudden.
The central hub’s now basically a huuuge floating platform, starts to rock back and forth, and the stress on the building is-- is, is huge. Cracks start appearing in the walls, and in the ceiling, and… Martine rushes over to Richard’s side. Um, and but, this has started a chain reaction that, that just, is not gonna stop. Um. Onyx, and… runs over and picks up Addison, and takes off, they flee, they-- they run. So does Grey, Grey runs after them. Um, and-- and so do uh, the other operatives, except for Sylvane. Sylvane is still standing there, waving his knives. He has positioned himself between you guys, and Martine and Richard.
Griffin: And they’re by-- and they’re by the door?
Clint: Yeah. The cracks in the walls start getting even larger, and large chunks of the ceiling start falling, exposing the sky and-- and the air outside. Um, the machinery, technology, start exploding, and you hear a claxon start to, start to ring. Um, telling people to escape, to-- to leave, and Martine looks up from Richard’s body and says,
Martine: He’s still alive no thanks to you!
Remy: You’re the one that shot him.
Nadiya: Yes you, you did that.
Martine: Well. Shut up!
Nadiya: Okay. Mary? Could you stop? You’ve made your point.
Mary: N...no, I can’t stop anything. Um. I’ve sent them away, I’ve split it all up…
Nadiya: You did great.
Remy: No you did awesome, but- but we’re still here, and we really need to get out of here and it’d be a lot easier if you weren’t tearing the base apart while that was happening
Nadiya: Can you walk?
Mary: I… can, um, wait a minute. I have an idea.
Clint: And all of a sudden, through one of the cracking decrepit walls of the room, a skimmer comes blasting through, and settles down amongst the debris, and the dust, and everything else. And through that hole in the wall, you can see that the central hub is starting to submerge.
Nadiya: Okay byee!
Remy: Everybody on. Pottsy? Come on bud. Oh Pottsy already left.
Justin: It just sounds right, now everyone’s split.
Clint: It’s just you guys.
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] Alright.
Justin: We’re leaping onto the skimmer for sure. Martine can fuck right off.
Griffin: Well I-- I say,
Remy: Come on, you all should get onboard, we don’t--
Martine: Nope!
Remy: No, guys, come on.
Martine: Nope!
Remy: You’re gonna die if you stay here and we-- we really need to get going, if you want your king to be safe we, we, we gotta go right now.
Justin: Kardala, um, runs over to Martine and Dick and uh, picks them up, one in each arm and says,
Kardala: Please. my king, uh-- [crosstalk overlapping with Remy] Your safety, is paramount to me.
Remy: [crosstalk] Kardala we’re not, we’re not doing that, no.
Kardala: I’m saving the king! Surely I will be honoured for this-- for this, amazing contribution.
Justin: Kardala is uh running towards the skimmer with both of them.
Clint: I-- And Sylvane, can’t follow very quickly cause of his injured leg. So he goes limping, and he runs out the door to try to find some other kind of escape.
Nadiya: Okay byeee.
Remy: Bye Sylvane.
Clint: And-- and you guys took Mary, right?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yessss.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure.
Clint: So, she looks down, and she’s lost a lot of blood. And. She tries to start the skimmer, and… it’s just not responding. It’s damaged itself when it came crashing through the wall. And the platform, the central hub, is now starting to sink below the waves. And the water is, is starting to come pouring in, and basically is surrounding the skimmer.
Nadiya: Remy--
Kardala: Allow-- Allow me.
Justin: And Kardala claps her hands and summons a thunderbolt to hit the skimmer.
Clint: [in a strangled sounding sort of voice] This is great!
Justin: Kardala has a, I would say, a poor understanding of electronics but thinks that this should do the job. [giggling]
Clint: Oh no!
Justin: Uh, so that is, I’m rolling against an opposition of two, and it’s a will roll… zero… [Clint: [crosstalk] I’m going to--] plus… [Clint: [crosstalk] I’m going to-- okay go ahead] plus three. So, three. So I do create the, the lightning bolt.
Clint: The lightning bolt hits the skimmer, and somehow that kind of jumpstarts everything. And Mary says,
Mary: Hang onto somethin’!
Clint: Just as the platform starts to go under the waves, and the skimmer backs up out of the hole, and hovers there on the waves. And you see the, the central hub, sink under the water. You also see in the distance, a number of other skimmers start to fly off. And they’re all gone. You’re watching this awesome hole in the water come crashing in like the Red Sea, filling back in after parting.
Griffin: I say um,
Remy: I have to buy some new clothes. Shit.
Travis: I look at Martine and I say,
Nadiya: Oh, oh this is so important. I can’t, I have to tell you one thing. Bonk!
Travis: And I turn, uh Nadiya turns her right arm into a baseball bat and clobbers her, trying to knock her unconscious. [laughing]
Travis: Oh no! Well. It all ends up being uh, a plus two, not great.
Clint: Okay a plus two, and an athletics roll to defend… [dice roll] Ah it’s alright. It’s a minus four! [laughter]
Travis: Okay.
Justin: So, real comedic {verity} we’ve got going on here.
Clint: That whacks up against her head, and she collapses right next to Richard.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Is Richard conscious?
Clint: He is conscious, but he is in a lot of pain.
Travis: Good.
Remy: Um. Sorry about your kingdom. I, this is, uh, wow what a waste.
[Clint laughing]
Kardala: Yes, I believe that represents… many stamps.
Nadiya: Uhh bummer, I guess.
Richard: [choking, in a croaky voice] [coughs] It’s… not the end… of the kingdom…
Nadiya: Hmm?
Richard: And it’s not the end… of… me… you might have shut down this… but I believe in what I stand for. I am committed…
Nadiya: Bonk!
[Laughter]
Griffin: Travis just rolled-- [descends into laughter] [indistinguishable] programme again.
Justin: That’s a, uh so what is that Trav-- [more laughter]
Travis: That is [laughing] plus four.
Clint: Okay. In this weakened condition that knocks him right out. He’s gone.
Kardala: You know demon, I like you more and more.
Griffin: I talk to Mary and I say,
Remy: Hey I’m glad you’re doing okay, d’you-- are you the one flying this thing right now? With your uh brain powers?
Mary: Mmhmm. Where’d you wanna go?
[pause]
Remy: The White House I guess?
Mary: And what’re you gonna do?
Remy: Hand over the king of America? I dunno I’m just thinkin’ out loud.
Nadiya: You know the White House isn’t a prison, right Remy? Like we could go to like, Joliet, or, I don’t know.
Remy: Yeah but you can’t just like take a guy to jail and be like “Here I got, got a new one for ya”.
[laughing]
Nadiya: That’s true.
Mary: Wh-what exactly, uh, crime, do you want him to be charged with?
Nadiya: Sedition. Treason.
Remy: Treason’s a good one, I mean he did sort of broadcast his treason to all of America so I think it’d be pretty easy to make a case.
Mary: Maybe. Maybe… he wasn’t entirely wrong.
Nadiya: Well okay.
Remy: Alright, but--
Mary: You tell me where to take him and we’ll take him there.
Remy: I like the idea of the White House, I don’t know about you all, but I think it could be fun.
Nadiya: I dunno, maybe the Pentagon?
Kardala: Why does the colour of the house figure into our decision?
Remy: Oh, great.
Kardala: That was a joke.
Remy: Oh it was-- hey
Nadiya: Oh!
Remy: that one was actually a joke!
Kardala: Thank you. Thank you.
[End music fades in]
Clint: And the skimmer goes zippin’ along the Gulf Coast, headed towards Washington D.C. Mary says,
Mary: Oh wait, okay! There’s something else.
Clint: She squints her eyes, and a little panel opens, and out come a bunch of strombolis.
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: [laughing] This motherfuckin’ Archie Comics ending to this.
Justin: I love it.
Griffin: And Jughead gets his burgers.
[Clint laughs]
[End music starts fading out at 58:24]
Griffin: So how close was that to what you were envisioning for the episode?
Clint: Uh.
Justin: Yeah I think a little bit of wrap up would make sense.
Travis: Okay.
Clint: That was fairly close, I knew I wanted to have a confrontation. I actually was gonna involve a couple more operatives but then I realised that would have been too confusing and too big. And I really, I wanted, I want there to be a conclusion. I had no idea how it was gonna end. [Griffin: Yeah.] I wanted there to be a conclusion, but I wanted it to still be open-ended if we still wanted to, y’know revisit these characters in the future, so… that really went-- I’m very pleased with how it came out!
Griffin: Alright!
Travis: Well good.
Justin: Good for the day.
Griffin: Uh, as long as we’re debriefing, cause the point of this is to learn, learn stuff. I like the Fate system, I don’t think it’s gonna be a good fit for [Travis: Yeah] the show. Just because kinda-- the, the, the way that combat is almost like a negotiation? Or, uh, you’re constantly tryna to like, calculate things with aspects which I should say right now we were not especially good stewards of those, [Travis: Yeah] we did play a little bit Calvinball to suit our needs--
Travis: It’s great for gameplay, it’s not so great for like, rapid narrative storytelling? [Griffin: Yeah, sure.] Especially when it comes to like, if you attack with this, which one do you defend with, that kind of stuff?
Clint: Well I think it’s good, I think it’s good for storytelling, I really do think it’s good for narrative.
Justin: Um.
Griffin: It’s just not necessarily what we’re, what we’re doing but I had fun! I had fun with it! I think--
Justin: Oh I loved Fate. It’s great.
Griffin: Um. Um yeah. I think-- I think we keep trying some. I mean obviously whatever we do next is gonna be a different system we’re still figuring it out, but yeah, that’d be great--
Travis: Then we’ll be back with a different story.
Griffin: Yeah great work dad, that was cool.
Justin: I liked all your great voices.
Griffin: [simultaneously with Clint] You worked very hard on voices.
Clint: [simultaneously with Griffin] I worked very hard on voices. [laughter]
Clint: Apparently what was limiting me was just doing one!
Justin: Just doing one-- [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Yeah, I needed to do twenty-four!
Justin: [crosstalk] You’re too, you’re too multifaceted.
Clint: Yeah I was just too big--
Justin: Like a diamond with one facet.
Clint: I was too good for the room.
Justin: I guess.
Griffin: So… I guess that’s it?
Clint: We might have one after credits sequence.
Travis: Oh shit yeah!
{61:31}
[Music]
Clint: It’s a hospital room, and Richard is hanging onto life. He is surrounded by monitors and wires and uh, Martine is by his side, Sylvane is standing over the side. The doctor walks in, checks the monitors, looks at her clipboard, looks at Martine, and says, um,
Doctor: He has a very long road ahead of him but I believe he’s going to survive. As a matter of fact, I would be willing to bet he’s going to… thrive.
Clint: And she reaches up and flips over her medical ID tag, and it has a twenty-four question mark logo on it.
THE END"
