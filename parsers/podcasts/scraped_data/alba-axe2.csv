"E201: A Taste of Something New","ELE:
Hi everyone! It’s Eli here, your writer and sound designer, back with long-awaited season 2 of The Axe & Crown.
We’ve got six shiny new episodes, one dropping every other week for you. Plus we’ve got a whole bunch of bonus episodes too. If you’re a and up supporter on Patreon you’ll get to hear those too.
For the first time, we are recording this thing at home, here on our attic studio where we also record The End of Time and Other Bothers, as well as our sci fi show Civilized. That makes it easier to record, and that means it’s going to be less of a wait between seasons, so that’s awesome. The only drawback is, there’s no control room so Sean and I have to keep quiet and not laugh all the way through the takes, because our cast are wonderful. Thanks to them. Thanks to our supporting producers, Kim Bellinger, Ryan Cushman and Kona. And thanks to all our supporters on Patreon. We are so grateful and so excited to be bringing this new season to you. We hope you enjoy it.
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe & Crown, Round 2!
Episode 1: A Taste of Something New.
MORNINE:
The bar is empty, but a big crowd is milling around outside. Stan is watching them out the window.
GUBBIE:
(hums to himself)
Hey, Stan! How you doing?
STAE:
(distracted)
Huh? Oh, morning Gubbin.
A moment passes.
GUBBIE:
Stan.
STAE:
Yeah.
GUBBIE:
Stan, no.
STAE:
What?
GUBBIE:
Whatever it is, we’re not doing it.
STAE:
What are we doing?
GUBBIE:
You’re staring out the window at the Badger and Bucket.
STAE:
Well, yeah, look, it’s across the street. If I look out the window, there’s not much else to see.
GUBBIE:
Uh huh. But that always means they’re doing some stupid trendy new thing that you’re gonna want us to do too.
STAE:
Yeah, probably. I mean, that’s what they do, they beat us to every cool new idea.
GUBBIE:
Okay. What is it? Fondue? Peanut butter tacos? 24-karat gold pie for a limited time only?
STAE:
It’s… brunch.
GUBBIE:
Huh?
STAE:
It’s a cross between breakfast and—
GUBBIE:
Yeah, the word is familiar to me. Are all those people actually lining up to get in?
STAE:
I mean, I guess.
GUBBIE:
You guess, Stan? What’s the matter with you?
STAE:
I dunno. It’s like you said, I’m always trying some stupid new thing here and it never works out.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, but it livens up the place.
STAE:
I just feel like maybe I should do something else, and leave this place to you and Betula to run. You’ve been here forever. You know what works.
GUBBIE:
I know what used to work. Business is changing around here. We’re sure not packing in patrons on a Saturday morning like we used to be. Look at all those people.
STAE:
Yeah, look at them. They’re really our crowd. All those hoity toity downtown hipster types.
GUBBIE:
Like you’re not one of them! Come on.
STAE:
Hanging out on the patio, eating their delicious-looking food.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. Just imagine all those hoity toity downtown folks coming here instead, with all their hoity toity cash and showering me in it. Heh heh. That’s a good dream.
The door opens.
GUBBIE:
Say, that could be one now!
BETULE:
Hey Stan. Hey Uncle.
GUBBIE:
Or not.
STAE:
Hey Betula.
BETULE:
What’s going on across the street? I’ve never seen it so packed.
STAE:
They’re serving brunch. It’s the new big thing, apparently.
BETULE:
Wow. Why aren’t we getting in on that action?
GUBBIE:
Good question. What do you think, Stan? This is your specialty.
STAE:
What is my specialty?
GUBBIE:
You’re all about this kinda trendy bullcrap anyway—um, I mean, opportunity. You’re our… let’s call it Head of Innovation.
STAE:
I am?
BETULE:
Yeah, you’re the one always trying out new ideas around here.
GUBBIE:
If it wasn’t for you, Stan, this place would just be a dusty, forgotten little hole in the wall. Like it used to be.
STAE:
Aw, thanks, guys.
I guess we could try serving brunch. We’re not gonna get that many people to fit in here, though. That’s the problem.
GUBBIE:
Course not. Brunch at the Axe and Crown will have to be a smaller affair. More intimate.
BETULE:
Yeah! More laid-back.
STAE:
Yeah, more cozy. We should have candles.
BETULE:
Maybe put up some work by local artists.
STAE:
Oh! That sounds so nice. How about a special craft beer? A breakfast beer!
GUBBIE:
Yeah! Yeah, see? That’s the Stan I know.
STAE:
Something with some real Axe and Crown flair. We could have pancakes shaped like little shields and things.
GUBBIE:
(with difficulty)
Yeah. Sure.
STAE:
Betula, you could make kling klangs!
BETULE:
Ooo. Or bone waffles. No! Seagull on toast.
STAE:
Oh yeah! I can see it now—sorry, did you say seagull?
GUBBIE:
Maybe Betula can hook us up with some of that unicorn coffee.
STAE:
Oh, unicorn coffee, wow! Where the unicorns, like, eat the berries and daintily spit out the beans?
GUBBIE:
Yeah, that’s how it’s made.
STAE:
Have you had that stuff? It is delicious. But how are we gonna get a hold of some?
BETULE:
I may have had a little something to do with bringing unicorn coffee to Grandville originally.
STAE:
Wait, what?! Why aren’t we serving it right now?
Silence.
BETULE:
Oh, Stan.
STAE:
What?
GUBBIE:
(starts chuckling)
STAE:
What? What’d I miss?
BETULE:
See… a couple months ago, this buddy of mine was due to get a coffee shipment in from Niamondu, but the caravan arrived two days early, in a total panic. Somehow the horses had gotten into the bags and they ate everything.
STAE:
Oh no!
BETULE:
Yeah. They did a three-day trip in one night. But all the coffee beans were gone. All he had were four really grumpy, really twitchy horses and a giant pile of poop.
STAE:
Oh man, wow!
Wait, what does this have to do with unicorns?
BETULE:
I’m getting there. Anyway, the poor guy was in tears. So I had to help him out. I took the, you know, shipment off his hands, added a little fake vanilla flavouring, and got some friends to come by and package it up. Sold most of it to different Bucket pubs.
STAE:
I know! They were serving it right across the street. But wait, if the horses ate everything…
GUBBIE:
(goes on laughing)
STAE:
Then how… there wouldn’t have been… no. No, no, no.
That means that the coffee was…
BETULE:
Wait. Did you go there and drink some?
STAE:
Well, of course I did! It’s unicorn coffee!
BETULE:
(groans)
GUBBIE:
(cackles)
STAE:
Think about it! When you hear the name “Unicorn Coffee”, are you gonna pass that by? I had to try that. It tasted really good!
BETULE:
Oh no, Stan, I’m sorry.
STAE:
Oh man.
BETULE:
I mean, at least they boil the water there when they make coffee.
GUBBIE:
(laughs harder)
STAE:
Wait. Did Dorothea know it was… not really from unicorns?
GUBBIE:
Yeah! And that the horses weren’t spitting out those beans?
STAE:
(groans)
BETULE:
She probably figured it out. I don’t think she cared either way.
STAE:
What? Really?
BETULE:
Nah. For her, it was just the latest hot new food trend.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, they always gotta have some weird new thing on the menu.
STAE:
Yeah, well, you know what? We’ll show them. As Head of…
GUBBIE:
Innovation.
STAE:
Thank you. Innovation—I say we’re gonna give that crowd a taste of new sensations like they have never seen!
GUBBIE:
That’s it, team!
Music sting.
NEXT SATURDAY AFTERNOOE:
The last of the brunch crowd filters out, leaving the bar empty.
STAE:
Bye guys! Thanks for coming! Tell your friends! Axe and Crown… brunchy brunch.
He shuts the door behind them, and drops the cheery façade.
STAE:
(sighs)
Oh, man.
GUBBIE:
You all right there, kid?
STAE:
Yeah, I’m fine.
GUBBIE:
What’s the matter? Brunch was a big hit.
STAE:
I guess it was.
GUBBIE:
You guess?
Betula emerges from the kitchen.
BETULE:
Well? How did we do?
GUBBIE:
(still talking to Stan)
Kid, we must have made eighty crowns!
BETULE:
Wow! That’s almost worth getting up early with a Saturday morning hangover.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. And that’s eighty crowns after the decorations and Stan’s cask of crap beer.
STAE:
Craft beer.
GUBBIE:
Craft.
STAE:
Craft. Say it with me.
GUBBIE:
Craaaaft. Craft beer. Geez, I keep getting that wrong.
STAE:
I know.
BETULE:
Hey, what’s going on? What’s up, Stan?
STAE:
Me? Oh, nothing. No, listen. I’m glad it went well.
BETULE:
This was your idea! Your first big idea as Head of Innovation. And it went great! Especially for the first time doing it.
GUBBIE:
Yeah! You sure told us.
See, this is where you’re supposed to rub it in our faces and dance around like an annoying little twerp.
STAE:
Look. There’s just something missing here, you know? I don’t know what it is. I can’t put my finger on it.
BETULE:
They got a patio.
GUBBIE:
And about ten more tables than us.
STAE:
Yeah, but it’s more than that. Something special.
GUBBIE:
Signature cocktails?
BETULE:
We had crabgrass smoothies. And our famous Mud Street Marmalade.
GUBBIE:
Okay, you gotta tell me. Is there some kinda gristle in that for the special ingredient?
BETULE:
Nope, my lips are sealed.
STAE:
Wait! I know what it was! Live music.
GUBBIE:
In the marmalade?
STAE:
No, no, across the street. They had that awesome fiddle player.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, roaming the patio and bugging everyone at their tables.
STAE:
Everyone was super into it! They were all laughing and clapping along, and that little girl was passing around the hat collecting coins—she was so cute. I guess she’s his daughter or something?
BETULE:
Granddaughter.
STAE:
Oh! Do you know him?
BETULE:
Yeah, Cinnamon Ted! He really knows how to work a crowd.
GUBBIE:
Heh heh.
STAE:
If you know him, why is he playing across the street? Why can’t we get him in here?
BETULE:
Well…
GUBBIE:
Well, let’s see. Given the choice between playing this charming but tiny little bar and the whole Badger and Bucket with its expensive patio, which would you choose?
STAE:
I guess that makes sense.
There’s a complicated knock at the back door.
STAE:
What’s that?
GUBBIE:
Oh. Sounds like one of yours, Betula.
BETULE:
Yeah, I’ll get that. One sec.
She heads off to answer the door.
STAE:
One of her what?
GUBBIE:
Nothing, nothing.
Betula opens the back door.
BETULE:
(from the back hallway)
Hey Ted. Hey Jessie.
TEE:
(from the back hallway)
Well hey there, Miss Betula!
STAE:
Hey, I think that’s the guy!
GUBBIE:
(feigning ignorance)
What guy?
Stan is halfway across the room.
STAE:
The fiddler guy! Aw, I gotta go say hello.
GUBBIE:
Wait, wait. Stan. I got an idea!
STAE:
Hold that thought. I’ll be right back.
GUBBIE:
A brunch idea, Stan! This one’s really good!
STAE:
I’ll be right back.
GUBBIE:
It’s gold! It’s got mocha!
STAE:
Hold on!
GUBBIE:
Doh! Dammit.
We follow Stan to the back door.
BETULE:
(hushed)
Oh yeah, this is a great bracelet, but it’s a little too unique, you know? It might have to leave town if it’s gonna sell—
STAE:
Hey guys!
BETULE:
(startled, guilty)
Stan!
STAE:
Are you Cinnamon Ted, by chance?
TEE:
Why yes, I’m Ted and this is Jessie.
STAE:
It is so good to meet you. I’m Stan.
BETULE:
Yeah, this is Stan, our fine and law-abiding landlord.
TEE:
A pleasure, my friend.
STAE:
I just wanted to say how great you were.
TEE:
Oh! Well, thank you very much.
STAE:
Listen. We were really groovin’ over here across the street listening to you.
TEE:
Too kind, too kind.
STAE:
Hey, your granddad’s pretty talented, isn’t he? Eh, Jessie? Hi! Hi there Jessie! Hello!
Silence.
TEE:
She doesn’t talk much.
STAE:
That’s okay! My name is Stan. How do you do, Jessie?
BETULE:
You don’t have to shake hands if you don’t want to, Jessie.
STAE:
Up to you. Hey, there ya go!
BETULE:
Oh boy.
STAE:
That’s an excellent handshake. High five! Down low—too slow! Heh heh! That was pretty funny, wasn’t it, Jessie? No. Not funny. Wow, tough room.
BETULE:
Well then, if that’s everything, Stan…
STAE:
Yeah, hey, listen. I just wanted to say, just while I have you here, that was a great job, Ted. I wish that we could get someone like you for our weekend brunch.
TEE:
Oh! Well, I’m afraid my weekends are booked up for the next little while.
STAE:
Whatever Dorothea is paying you, I’ll double it!
TEE:
Oh, she’s not paying me. It’s all passing the hat, plus a pinch of petty pilfer…
BETULE:
(clears her throat)
TEE:
…I mean, a pinch of passing the hat some more. Surprisingly lucrative.
STAE:
I’ll make up the difference.
TEE:
I hate to say it, but that’s gonna be a pretty big difference.
STAE:
I don’t care.
TEE:
Especially if we’re, you know…
(he catches another look from Betula)
Doing things above board.
STAE:
Above board? I don’t—
(dawning realization)
Oh. Oh my gosh.
BETULE:
There it is.
STAE:
Are you telling me that all the while you’re busking at these places, you’re… you are not declaring your income?
TEE:
Yeah. Heh. Yeah, exactly. Promise you won’t tell?
STAE:
Oh, well, sure. Yeah, that’s cool. Cool cool cool cool. Listen, I’m down with you. I know. It’s hard making a living as an artist.
TEE:
That it is. So glad you understand.
STAE:
Oh, a hundred percent. So… what would it take to convince you to play at the Axe and Crown?
BETULE:
Uh, Stan, can we talk about this later?
STAE:
Oh, sorry, sorry! I totally barged in. That is my fault. You guys were talking about—hey, that’s a nice bracelet.
TEE:
Yeah. This belonged to my mother. I was just asking Betula what I might be able to get for it.
STAE:
Wait. Isn’t that a Louisa Shilman piece? That knotwork is totally Shilman.
TEE:
It is? Gosh.
BETULE:
Wow.
TEE:
I had no idea.
STAE:
This thing is probably worth a thousand crowns!
TEE:
Whoa!
BETULE:
Really!
STAE:
I know just the place to take it. You won’t get a better price for it anywhere. I guarantee it!
TEE:
Really? That’s… that’s awfully nice of you.
STAE:
Oh yeah. Super honest folks. They do appraisals and everything, they’ll register it and make sure it’s not stolen…
TEE:
Okay! I’ll have think about it.
STAE:
Would that perhaps be worth maybe a show or two for brunch?
TEE:
I’m not completely sure I want to part with this just yet.
BETULE:
Oh, yeah, a family heirloom like that, I get it.
STAE:
Oh, I get it too, completely. If you change your mind, just come and find me.
TEE:
Will do.
BETULE:
Yeah, for sure. No need to sell it today.
STAE:
Are you okay, Betula?
BETULE:
Why? Pffft. I’m fine. You! You’re—what?
STAE:
Are you sure you’re fine?
BETULE:
(scoffs)
Yes.
STAE:
Ted? Did this bracelet really belong to your mother?
TEE:
Yeah! Course it did!
STAE:
‘Cause I’m getting the feeling, and I’m just spit-balling here, that this belonged to somebody else until recently, and found its way into your possession through unknown means. Am I wrong in that assumption?
BETULE:
Oh boy.
TEE:
I swear, my old Ma got it as a wedding present…
STAE:
No, no, no, no, it’s all good, it’s all good. Cool, cool, I’m down. I’m down with that. I’m all about supporting the regular people. That’s the way it works, I’m just putting one over on all those rich snobs, yeah. Share the wealth, just get it around there. That’s what I’m—
BETULE:
Yeah. Stealing.
STAE:
Yes. Stealing. That’s—yes. Betula, I wasn’t gonna say it out loud, not in front of the girl—where’d she go?
Whoa! Hey, sorry. Almost stepped on you. Sorry, Jessie!
BETULE:
It’s fine, Stan.
STAE:
Jessie, do you want a lollipop?
(silence)
Jessie, do you want glass of lemonade?
Jessie, do you want to go in and see Gubbin? So us grownups can go on discussing this extremely boring topic?
BETULE:
Actually, Ted, why don’t you two head out, and I’ll catch up to you at the hmm-hmmm-hmm.
TEE:
Gotcha. What time?
Betula makes a subtle hand gesture.
TEE:
Okay. See you then! Nice meeting you, Stan.
STAE:
Oh, hey, nice meeting you too…
(whispers)
What just happened?
BETULE:
Never mind.
TEE:
Jessie? Do you want to give the nice man back his wallet?
Stan pats his pockets frantically.
STAE:
My—Jessie! You thieving little…!
(he snatches the wallet)
I mean, thank you, Jessie, that was a good thing you did, giving it back.
TEE:
Farewell, my friends!
BETULE:
Bye, guys.
Jessie and Ted slip out into the alleyway. The door shuts.
STAE:
How did she do that?!
BETULE:
She’s good.
STAE:
When did she take my wallet, though? Was it when we shook hands?
BETULE:
It was while you were high-fiving her.
STAE:
Oh, damn. That’s impressive.
Hey, that little hand-wavy thing you and Ted did? Was that like, code?
BETULE:
The less you know, the better, Stan.
She heads back to the bar. Stan follows.
STAE:
Aw, but… no, Betula! I’m cool with it. I’m cool cool. Everything’s cool cool.
GUBBIE:
Oh, he’s cool now. Huh.
Well, how’d that go?
BETULE:
He knows.
GUBBIE:
I tried.
BETULE:
Sure.
STAE:
Wait. Hold on. Pause. You two do this a lot? Why didn’t you tell me you had like, a super secret thieving operation?
BETULE:
There’s no “operation”.
STAE:
How does the sign language work? Do you guys like, hold up three fingers for “Look out for guards”? Or waggle your eyebrows for “Meet me behind the lodge at midnight”?
BETULE:
Stan. You know I can’t tell you.
STAE:
You can tell me! I can keep a secret! I’m so good at keeping secrets! Secrets are the—
I totally can’t keep a secret.
BETULE:
I know you’re curious, but… remember the last time, with that lady who was a were-cow.
STAE:
Yeah, it kinda slipped out. But at least no one got trampled that badly…
Look, you know me. I just wanna be a part of whatever it is you’re doing! Because you guys, I think of you like family, you know? You’re always good to me, and I want to help.
GUBBIE:
(sighs)
There is one big thing you can do.
STAE:
Yeah? Yeah? What?
GUBBIE:
Run a good, honest tavern.
BETULE:
Exactly. Make this place look legit.
GUBBIE:
Like we’re just keeping up with the Badger and Bucket and everybody else in town.
STAE:
Okay!
GUBBIE:
And that will really help Betula with her “business dealings”.
BETULE:
Oh, my “business dealings”? What about your “business dealings”?
STAE:
You have business dealings too?
GUBBIE:
I just pour the beer.
BETULE:
(scoffs)
Yeah, you pour the beer.
GUBBIE:
That’s all, just a little bit here, a little bit there… heh heh.
So, Stan? What do you say?
STAE:
Yeah! Run a tavern? I can do that.
BETULE:
Thanks, Stan. I appreciate it.
STAE:
Whatever you need, I gotcha.
GUBBIE:
Good.
STAE:
First order of business: brunch planning for next weekend!
BETULE:
Perfect. I have one seagull left.
STAE:
There’s a little cafe downtown—no, skip the seagull—they serve toast with this weird new kind of squishy green fruit and sea salt on top. Mmmm. So good.
GUBBIE:
All right, all right. Serve whatever the hell you want, just leave me out of it.
STAE:
Oooh, and I want one of those cool little griddle things for making crêpes…
GUBBIE:
I am gonna go find a horse and see if it will kick me in the head.
STAE:
You do that. I am gonna get down to business, because we are gonna take down the Badger and Bucket once and for all.

The Axe & Crown, Round 2!
Episode 2: The Cutting Edge.
INT. BAR—MONDAY MORNINE:
Stan enters from the street, struggling to carry something big and wooden.
GUBBIE:
What the hell are you doing?
STAE:
Morning, guys!
BETULE:
Hey, Stan.
GUBBIE:
Why do you have a giant board?
STAE:
It’s a blackboard. See?
BETULE:
Stan!
GUBBIE:
No!
Too late. Stan turns the board around and knocks over a table. A tankard goes flying.
STAE:
Whoops!
GUBBIE:
Kid—
STAE:
Sorry about that, guys! I’m just gonna install it in the back room.
GUBBIE:
Why? What, are we teaching school now? No! Where the hell are you gonna put it?
STAE:
Just on the far wall beside the windows.
GUBBIE:
And cover the dartboard?
STAE:
No, no, no! It’s for our new meeting space-slash-studio, see?
GUBBIE:
Oh boy, this sounds like a winner.
BETULE:
Wait, the back room already is a meeting space.
STAE:
Yeah, but now it’ll have better tables to work at, nice chairs, natural lighting…
BETULE:
Natural—
She runs to the back room.
BETULA (CONT’D)
Dammit, Stan!
STAE:
What? Isn’t it nicer with those boards down off the windows?
GUBBIE:
You took the boards down?!
STAE:
Yup!
GUBBIE:
Kid…
STAE:
What? You said you want me to run the tavern as best as I can.
GUBBIE:
Sure. But not by doing stuff. Just clear it with us before you open the windows, or clean up a stain, or throw away a body part, or fix the floorboards—anything! Just clear it with us.
Betula returns.
BETULE:
Stan, the whole point of having a back room is that no one can see in.
STAE:
Yeah, but there’s no fresh air, and it’s so dreary during the day. Who wants to do work in a stuffy, pitch-black room?
BETULE:
Me and my associates do. It’s kind of vital to certain, you know, discussions.
STAE:
(conspiratorial)
Oh, hey, right, yeah, discussions. Uh huh. Gotcha.
BETULE:
Can we just put the boards back up?
STAE:
Hey, how about some big heavy curtains instead?
BETULE:
Fine. Why do you need light back there, anyway? Who’s gonna be working there during the day?
STAE:
Me and my associates!
GUBBIE:
Your what?
STAE:
Well, okay, just one associate so far. But we’re growing fast! See, me and my buddy Kalzak are starting a company.
GUBBIE:
Kalzak? Kalzak the Disheveled?
STAE:
That’s him! Doesn’t like that name, but yes.
BETULE:
Who’s Kalzak?
GUBBIE:
Remember that guy in the blue robe a couple nights ago? Kinda beat-up looking.
BETULE:
Oh yeah, him. Always hides in the corner? Talks to himself a lot?
GUBBIE:
That’s Kalzak.
STAE:
Oh, he’s not talking to himself. He’s actually talking to his guardian spirit Ephos.
GUBBIE:
Oh, so that kind of wizard. A demon-summoner.
BETULE:
Well, that’s a relief.
STAE:
Well, technically, Ephos isn’t a demon.
GUBBIE:
Technically, I haven’t showered in three years.
STAE:
That’s true. Anyway, Kal’s an old buddy of mine! He’s coming by this afternoon and we’re gonna talk business.
GUBBIE:
Huh. What kind of business?
STAE:
Magic services!
GUBBIE:
(groans)
STAE:
No, it’s the new big thing. You don’t have to know anything about magic, or spells, or summoning—
GUBBIE:
Good, ’cause you don’t!
STAE:
No, I don’t, but that’s the point! We do all the work, see? The trick is finding a niche. One little specialized service you can do easily, but that people will pay for!
BETULE:
Huh. So what’s your “niche”?
STAE:
Well, first off we were thinking of remote visiting.
BETULE:
Like one of those mirrors that let you talk to somebody else?
STAE:
Yeah! Yeah! Like that. But it turns out there’s a group at the University already working on a pocket version of that.
BETULE:
So you could talk to other people pretty much any time, anywhere?
STAE:
Exactly!
GUBBIE:
Ugh. Makes me want to eat my own intestines.
BETULE:
No, no, wait. That could be handy, actually.
STAE:
Right? But then Kalzak and I came up with the killer idea. It’s gonna make us a million crowns.
GUBBIE:
All right, let’s hear this.
STAE:
All right. Ready?
GUBBIE:
Yeah?
STAE:
Food delivery.
Silence.
GUBBIE:
That’s it?
STAE:
Magical food delivery.
GUBBIE:
(scoffs)
We’re not some five-star Mellurian restaurant. Anyway, if they want our food, they can come here their damn selves.
STAE:
No, no, this is the genius part. We don’t just deliver our food. We deliver for every restaurant in the city, even your five-star Mellurian place—right to your home! By magic.
BETULE:
Wait. Why do you need magic? What’s wrong with hiring some kid to deliver it for a few pennies?
STAE:
Eh… I’m not really good at managing kids. They tend to be—
GUBBIE:
Smarter than you?
STAE:
Yeah. And I keep losing my wallet. But compare that to magic delivery! Arrives immediately, no fuss, no muss, no “oops, I dropped it in a puddle”. Just great food, straight from the kitchen! I’ll be right back.
Stan hurries into the back room.
GUBBIE:
I think I smell the apocalypse.
BETULE:
Oh come on, Uncle. Just for once, be supportive.
Stan brings out two boxes and sets them on the bar.
STAE:
Check this out.
BETULE:
What are these?
STAE:
These two things are called Jessemer boxes. They’re linked with a displacement charm.
BETULE:
They seem kinda small.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, who’s our target market here? Rats?
STAE:
Gubbin. It’s called a “proof of concept”. The real ones are gonna be bigger than this. But the concept is, we have a box, and the customer has a box. So if I put, let’s say this tankard in one, and… oh, that’s not gonna fit. Okay, let’s use peanuts. Here, these peanuts.
He cracks the shell on a peanut.
STAE:
I put one in each box, close the door, push the button and—
A whoosh from inside the box. Stan opens the doors again.
STAE:
See? The one with the shell off is over here now.
BETULE:
So they swap whatever’s inside them?
STAE:
Exactly! They switch contents. So the idea is, our customers just pick from a menu and we get notified of their order!
GUBBIE:
Notified how?
STAE:
Still working that part out. But when the meal’s ready, we put it in the box, the customer puts money in the box, we hit the button and boom! They get their food, we get paid!
GUBBIE:
And what if they don’t put any money in? What if we get an empty box?
STAE:
Ah, but see, there has to be something in each box. It’s the law of magical something something!
GUBBIE:
They could put rocks in it.
STAE:
Yeah, they totally could.
GUBBIE:
That could satisfy the law of something something.
STAE:
But then they would get reported, and we’d just cancel their subscription.
GUBBIE:
And meanwhile we’re out the price of a meal.
STAE:
No, no, no, see, we’ll charge a deposit on the box. If you cheat, you don’t get that money back. A ha ha ha!
GUBBIE:
Eh, maybe.
STAE:
You just don’t trust people, do you, Gub?
GUBBIE:
Who got his wallet stolen by a five-year-old?
BETULE:
Interesting… So this can transport anything?
STAE:
Well… we still have to do a bit of testing.
Music sting.
THE NEXT DA:
Betula shouts from the kitchen.
BETULE:
Food’s up!
STAE:
Thanks Betula! C’mon, Gubbin. Check this out.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, yeah. Let’s see.
STAE:
Behold! The prototype delivery system for Meals By Magic!
GUBBIE:
Okay.
STAE:
Aren’t these boxes nice? I got in touch with this cabinet maker who used to do work for my dad—
GUBBIE:
Yeah, yeah, let’s see it go.
STAE:
Okay, okay, sit down. Imagine I am a hungry customer. “Ooh, I am so hungry! I want food! But I need convenience too.” I look through the Meals By Magic menu, and oh boy! What do I find there? Peppered mock pigeon pie and mashed turnip, that sounds great! I want to put that in my belly. So I put the order in—somehow, we’re still working on that part—and… that’s gonna be three crowns, please, sir!
GUBBIE:
What? You want me to put in three crowns?
STAE:
It’s for the test. Yes. C’mon, Gub. You’ll get them back. The other box is in the kitchen with Betula.
Gubbin mutters as he fishes three coins out of the till.
GUBBIE:
Who’s gonna pay three crowns for a pie?
STAE:
Remember, it’s not just the pie. You are paying for the convenience. So just put your coins in.
GUBBIE:
(grumbles)
All right.
He puts in the coins.
STAE:
Close up the box there, yup, just like that. And while you’re doing that, your meal is already being prepared by the Axe and Crown’s expert chefs.
GUBBIE:
Yeah? Guess we’ll need some of those.
STAE:
(shouts)
Betula, are you all ready in there?
BETULE:
(from the kitchen)
One mock pigeon pie, ready to go.
STAE:
(to Betula)
Okay! You may press the button when ready!
BETULE:
Here we go!
A whoosh of magical energy and a ding! Stan opens his cabinet.
STAE:
Bingo! The first ever delivery from Meals By Magic!
GUBBIE:
(impressed)
All right! Maybe you’re on to something here, Stanny.
Betula emerges from the kitchen.
BETULE:
Did it work?
STAE:
You bet it did! Look at that. Piping hot, straight from the oven.
BETULE:
Not bad!
STAE:
Eh? Eh?
Gubbin is poking at the pie.
GUBBIE:
Piping hot, huh?
STAE:
Yeah! It’s—wait. How come it’s cold?
BETULE:
It’s cold?
GUBBIE:
Cold? It’s frozen.
He bonks the pie against the plate.
BETULE:
What? I just took that out of the oven.
STAE:
Weird. Well, I’m sure we can sort that out. I’ll ask Kal about it. The important thing is, the customer has their meal, and we get paid!
They all head to the kitchen, where Stan opens the other cabinet. Flames crackle.
STAE:
Ta-da!
BETULE:
Whoa! Fire!
STAE:
Hey! No!
GUBBIE:
(coughing)
Close that up! Get some water!
STAE:
Why are the coins red-hot?
GUBBIE:
You melted my money! Stan, I’m gonna kill—
BETULE:
Hey! Not now! Give me the bucket! Move that bucket over here.
GUBBIE:
Quick, quick, quick!
Stan shoves a wooden bucket over to Betula, who douses the burning cabinet. Steam hisses.
GUBBIE:
Man, it smells like feet!
STAE:
Is everybody okay?
GUBBIE:
Ah, god, that reeks.
STAE:
(coughing)
Darn it. That was a really nice cabinet.
GUBBIE:
Look, Stan, this is exciting progress and all, but maybe you can work on your new prototype somewhere else than my tavern! Doesn’t your buddy Kalzak have his own damn workshop?
STAE:
He did, yeah. Um, it burned down.
BETULE:
Shoulda seen that one coming.
STAE:
But look, isn’t this amazing? If he hadn’t accidentally burned down his workshop, he wouldn’t have had to rent a room here, and we never would have met and started this cutting-edge new business!
GUBBIE:
Yeah, we’re all blessed.
STAE:
It’s gonna work, Gubbin.
GUBBIE:
Nah, I get it. Engineering something is complicated, it’s gonna be messy. Just don’t burn down my building, okay?
STAE:
Okay.
GUBBIE:
And you owe me three crowns.
Music sting.
THE NEXT DA:
Stan enters from the kitchen.
STAE:
Okay, Kal’s figured it out!
GUBBIE:
Oh yeah? Did he get your magic boxes working?
STAE:
Well, see, here’s the thing. A pie on a plate is a lot bigger and heavier than a couple of coins.
GUBBIE:
You’re right, the man’s a genius.
STAE:
I know, right? So when you displace that excess matter, it all gets turned into heat. Or cold. Or something. It’s the law of magical conversation… conversion… it’s a law. It’s a magical law. So… something like that.
GUBBIE:
So we make really tiny pies.
STAE:
No, c’mon, I’m being serious here.
Wait, now I want tiny pies.
Music sting.
THE NEXT DA:
Betula walks into the back room.
BETULE:
Hey Stan, can you please make sure you and Kal clean up in here? I got some people coming by tonight.
STAE:
Oh, sure, sure. Hey Betula! That counterweight idea worked. It’s reduced the fire risk by 45 percent!
BETULE:
That’s good news.
STAE:
I know. Although for some reason you can’t send grapes? It’s super weird.
BETULE:
Is that what happened here?
STAE:
Huh? Oh no, no, this was us testing out long-distance delivery. Um, it seems the further apart the boxes are, the more the cargo gets… scrambled.
BETULE:
Eh. Still edible, though.
STAE:
Not really. The stew’s all mixed together with little chunks of bowl—
She’s already eating some.
BETULE:
(crunching)
That’s pretty good, actually.
STAE:
Oh. Well. You do you.
BETULE:
Mmm.
Music sting.
DAYS LATEE:
Stan is pacing the room.
STAE:
All right! Who’s gonna be famous? Who’s gonna turn the restaurant business upside down? Us, that’s who!
BETULE:
The brochures do look pretty good.
STAE:
Yeah, aren’t they great? Oh man, I can’t believe this is happening.
GUBBIE:
(reads)
“Meals by Magic. Grab some of Grandville’s greatest grub, without leaving your home.” Too bad we’re bringing them here for a demo.
BETULE:
Hey, I worked hard on these pies.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, well, let’s see if they impress all those fancy restaurant and hotel people.
STAE:
People are gonna love ’em. Man, I wish Kal could be here.
BETULE:
Well…
STAE:
I mean, yeah, apart from his shyness.
GUBBIE:
Also his tendency to yak away non-stop to his demon friend.
STAE:
His guardian spirit.
GUBBIE:
His invisible demonic guardian spirit.
STAE:
Yes. It’s… sort of like what it is.
GUBBIE:
It’s exactly like what it is.
STAE:
Anyway, it was a good idea to have him stay in his room and let me do the pitching.
BETULE:
Yeah. So… where is everybody?
GUBBIE:
Did you get the time wrong on the brochure again?
STAE:
(he double-checks)
No, it’s right, eleven AM. Maybe they’re just late, I dunno.
BETULE:
All of them?
STAE:
Oh geez.
Wait. What the heck?
He paces to the front door and opens it. There’s a noisy but mostly polite crowd outside.
STAE:
Hey everybody! The demo’s happening over here! Hello? Hello?
No one answers.
BETULE:
What’s going on across the street?
STAE:
(completely crestfallen)
Oh no…
GUBBIE:
Something going on at the Badger and Bucket?
BETULE:
There’s banners up everywhere. “Announcing a new breakthrough in food delivery: Mudlark Meals To Go.”
STAE:
They stole our idea! The Badger and Bucket are starting their own delivery business.
GUBBIE:
They’re doing what?!
(he hurries to look out the door too)
Those bastards!
BETULE:
“Featuring fare from Farloria’s finest food-makers.” Wow, those are some big names. Chateau Lumiera, The Royal Stork… all the Bucket Pubs, of course.
Stan closes the door.
STAE:
They stole our idea and beat us to market.
GUBBIE:
Do they have our little cabinets and everything?
STAE:
They must have been spying on us all this time.
BETULE:
This is why we don’t have windows in the back room.
GUBBIE:
Or maybe they gave your friend the “wizard” a better offer.
BETULE:
No, no, you guys. Look—there’s their big secret.
STAE:
Where? What?
GUBBIE:
Ahhh. So they just hired a whole bunch of street urchins to deliver food for them.
STAE:
They stole your idea, Betula.
BETULE:
Well, not really my idea. I mean, it’s basically like, I dunno, you lean out a window, you yell for some kid to bring you the biggest turkey from the shop around the corner. Except without the leaning out your window part.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. They must have some kind of dispatch system.
STAE:
Aw, man, what are we going to do now?
GUBBIE:
I tell you what we’re gonna do now. We are gonna keep working on the Meals by Magic thing.
STAE:
You think we still have a shot?
GUBBIE:
Sure! Where’s your competitive spirit? You gotta want to win this.
BETULE:
It’s true! Think of all the reasons you went with magical delivery.
STAE:
Yeah! Our cabinets can get you the food in seconds.
GUBBIE:
And no one’s stealing the middle out of your sandwich along the way.
BETULE:
Not to mention, there’s plenty of other uses for your magic boxes.
STAE:
Really? Are there?
GUBBIE:
Well, gee, yeah. Getting cargo instantly from point A to point B, let me think.
STAE:
So maybe the post office! Or stores.
BETULE:
Yes. Those places. Or I know some folks in the, uh, “shipping” business who’d love to get their hands on some of these boxes.
STAE:
Really?
GUBBIE:
Yeah, like maybe you’re in harbour and they want to get something past customs inspection a little quicker?
BETULE:
That kind of thing.
STAE:
Smuggling! That’s brilliant! Woo hoo!
BETULE:
Okay, not so loud.
GUBBIE:
I bet Betula’s friends would pay good money, even for a prototype.
STAE:
Yes, yes! They can be our initial investors. Let me talk to Kal.
BETULE:
Maybe don’t use the word “smuggling”.
STAE:
Oh, oh! Brain exploding. What if you disguised one of these as a hotel safe?
GUBBIE:
Ohh. Interesting!
BETULE:
Guys.
GUBBIE:
But you’re only gonna get to pull that trick once. Someone’s gonna notice their stuff missing.
BETULE:
Okay, settle down. Fellas.
STAE:
Sorry, sorry, legitimate tavern owner here. I know nothing of any criminal activities in this neighbourhood.
BETULE:
Thanks.
STAE:
Do you know any good counterfeiters?

ANNOUNCEMENTE:
SEAE:
Hey everyone. Sean here, and before we get to the super fun outtake, I just want to tell you a little bit more about Shaker & Spoon.
Shaker & Spoon sends boxes to you. So it’s a subscription cocktail service, and it helps you basically make handcrafted drinks made by some of the best mixologists. It has everything in the box except the bottle of alcohol that you need to buy for that month’s box. And you can also pick which box you’re going to get. It’s just super fun, and I can’t tell you how much laughter we had, trying drinks—and they were good drinks. And the boxes are about $40 to $50 a month depending what you pick. But you can get $20 off your first box by going to shakerandspoon.com/albasalix.
And again, quick reminder, we’re running that special offer for the next 30 days. If you go to patreon.com/albasalix or go to albasalix.com and click on the Patreon button, you can learn more, but for a limited time, you’re going to get access to these special stickers. And if we get enough people, we’re going to get two stickers and a coaster out to everyone.
And as always, we want to thank all of you for listening and staying with us. And a super giant thank you to our supporting producers: Kim Bellinger, Ryan Cushman and Kona.

GUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Okay, maybe I just have to twist my thigh or something.
(a little higher-pitched)
Woo hoo.
STAN (ART CARLSON)
You’re really—you’re nailing the “woo”. I’ve never heard anybody get the “woo” so accurately before. It’s the “hoo” where we run into trouble.

SEAE:
Hey everyone. Sean here with a couple quick announcements. First of all, I want to say thank you to each and every one of you for being with us and getting excited about the return of The Axe & Crown, and sharing it with friends and leaving reviews. We also have a sponsor this week that I’m so excited about: it’s Shaker & Spoon, we talked about them last week, but our next box is on the way and we’re so excited. And I’m going to be back to talk to you about our plans—what we’re going to do with that next cocktail box, at the end before the blooper. But in the meantime, remember that you can get $20 off your first box at shakerandspoon.com/albasalix. Let me tell you, subscription cocktails are the bomb.
And last but not least, we’ve hit the next tier on the special offer we’re running at patreon.com/albasalix. For every five people who sponsor us at the $5 level or higher a month, we add another item into the giveaway tier. Please help me send you cool stuff! Help us get to that next tier. We’re in Tier 2, and I think we can hit Tier 3 if not Tier 4 or higher. I’m not even prepared for Tier 5! Make me scramble.

Episode 4: As Good As Gone.
INT. BAR—SATURDAY MORNINE:
The soft tapping of a hammer. Stan hums to himself as he puts up decorations.
Betula comes down the stairs.
BETULE:
(yawns)
Stan, what are you doing?
STAE:
Aw, geez! Sorry, Betula. All this was supposed to be a surprise.
BETULE:
The decorations?
STAE:
Yeah. It’s for Trølsundag!
BETULE:
Yeah, I guessed by the flags everywhere.
STAE:
Yeah! It took me ages to find those. Gubbin is gonna go nuts.
BETULE:
Yeah, he is. Stan, I don’t think this is a good idea.
STAE:
What? Why not?
Gubbin trudges in.
GUBBIE:
(half-asleep)
What the hell are you guys doing up so early?
STAE:
It’s Saturday! Also known as Brunch Day!
GUBBIE:
It’s too early for brunch. Or day. This is getting ridiculous.
STAE:
Sorry, Gub. I wanted to get the decorations done before you were up, so it’d be a surprise.
GUBBIE:
Wanted what to be a surprise?
He looks around.
GUBBIE:
Oh no.
No, no, no, no no. You didn’t.
STAE:
Surprise!
GUBBIE:
What the hell were you thinking?! No, never mind. I don’t care. Get all this crap off my walls!
STAE:
But… it’s Trølsundag! It’s your national holiday!
GUBBIE:
Not my national holiday.
BETULE:
Sorry, Stan.
STAE:
But I made special menus and everything! I thought maybe you could make kling klangs, and we’ve still got some of that weird coal cheese stuff. I figure any human who can eat some and keep it down, we give them their meal for free!
GUBBIE:
Don’t you waste our food on your stupid brunch crowd.
STAE:
I figured out how to colour the beer blue, too. And look! Look at these placemats. See? They’ve got sayings in Trølsig, so people can learn the language.
Gubbin takes a paper placemat.
GUBBIE:
“Whan iss in der boat, geschtarten paddlen.”
BETULE:
That’s not grammatical.
STAE:
Aw man. Sorry, I should have run it past you guys. But, you know… surprise!
GUBBIE:
Why the hell’s it written like that, anyway?
BETULE:
I guess it’s supposed to look like runes?
STAE:
Isn’t that cool? I’m just gonna put up these last two flags.
GUBBIE:
No. Stop.
STAE:
What’s the matter, Gubbin?
GUBBIE:
Take it all down. Now.
STAE:
Why?
GUBBIE:
Brunch is cancelled on account of the bartender has a headache!
He stomps away behind the bar, and pours himself a drink.
STAE:
But I made centerpieces and everything.
BETULE:
Take it down, Stan.
STAE:
I don’t understand. I thought Trølsundag was a pretty big party for you guys.
BETULE:
Look. It is a big national holiday.
STAE:
When Torun the Assertive pulled the big sword from the furnace and led the trolls to independence from Snögard, right?
BETULE:
Yeah.
STAE:
See? I’ve read stuff. Down with the ice giant overlords and Trølsig for the trolls!
BETULE:
Right. But that’s the trouble. A lot of people thought that’s all Trølsund should be—troll country. Never mind that giants and goblins and treefolk have been living there for a thousand years.
STAE:
Oh.
BETULE:
Next thing you know, they’re trying to send everyone else “back to the mountains”. Where they never lived in the first place.
STAE:
But you guys didn’t think that.
BETULE:
No. But Gubbin’s Ma, my Aunt Tegrun, she was all in.
STAE:
Oh. Oh. Ouch.
Gubbin wanders back.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. Why do you think I left home?
STAE:
I’m so sorry, Gubbin. Is that how you ended up here?
GUBBIE:
Yeah. Left home, worked on ships, ended up in Farloria and joined the army.
Place isn’t always the greatest, but at least it’s better sometimes, you know?
And Ma, she can’t call me a coward any more.
STAE:
No. Holy crow.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. So all these flags and banners and things, they kind of leave a bad taste, you know?
STAE:
I get it. I totally get it. I’m sorry, Gubbin. And Betula. I did a bad thing.
GUBBIE:
Just get them out of here.
STAE:
Sure thing.
He goes about his task.
STAE:
Is it okay if we still do brunch?
GUBBIE:
Eh, sure.
STAE:
So… is there a better holiday? One without the connotations?
BETULE:
Solstice is coming up.
STAE:
Yeah, but we already have Solstice! Humans do that. Winter festival! Singing songs, dressing up like talking trees…
BETULE:
Also somewhat problematic, but never mind.
STAE:
Do you guys have different traditions for Solstice? Like, what did you do last year?
GUBBIE:
Eh, last year wasn’t a good year.
STAE:
Oh. Right. That must have been around the time of the Johann incident.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. You could say the mood was a little heavy.
STAE:
Okay, so what did you do when you were kids?
BETULE:
Uh… Bobbing for flaming plums? That was always fun.
STAE:
Sorry—plums that are on fire?
BETULE:
Making snow boulders. Setting fire to things behind the fire department. Heh. You used to do that, didn’t you, Uncle?
GUBBIE:
Yeah. That was a good time.
Or First Night. The goblin families down the road used to go house to house, visiting everyone with presents. One year they gave me this cutest little toy trebuchet.
STAE:
Aww! I can totally see that. Little baby Gubbin, flinging things around, settin’ traps. Hey, is that how you got into engineering?
GUBBIE:
Come to think of it—yeah, probably.
STAE:
That is adorable.
BETULE:
What about you, Stan? What did your family do at Solstice?
STAE:
Oh, it was very traditional. Nothing fancy—that would have meant just spending money. So we just did the usual Solstice cake, and after dinner we’d all light candles and do New Year’s wishes.
BETULE:
That’s where you write your wish for the year on a paper and burn it?
STAE:
Yeah. Wait, do you not do that?
BETULE:
It sounds a little bit like gluck-vin-oth.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, kinda.
BETULE:
Gluck-vin is… how would you say it?
GUBBIE:
Like good fortune.
BETULE:
Yeah. Yeah. Everybody says one special thing that happened to them this year. Something you feel thankful for. And then one thing you pledge to do in the coming year, that’s the oth.
STAE:
Oh! You know, I like that. So it’s not just a wish, it’s actually gettin’ things done.
GUBBIN AND BETULE:
Ehh…
STAE:
What else? What else? Tell me more. Tell me more. I want to know everything. More troll traditions! Or “troll-ditions”. Eh? See what I did there?
GUBBIE:
Well, there’s Efgnar.
BETULE:
(groans)
STAE:
Ef-gnar? What is that? Is that a food? Is that a parade? What’s Efgnar?
GUBBIE:
It’s a giant beast like a bear, who comes and visits all the children.
STAE:
Oh! And then gives them candy, like Old Mother Blizzard?
GUBBIE:
Nah. She roars in their faces, raaaargh!
STAE:
Oog.
GUBBIE:
And if they run away, she chases them down and eats them slowly.
STAE:
Okay, that’s traumatizing.
GUBBIE:
And if they stand their ground, they get a pie made from the other children.
STAE:
I… like pie…
GUBBIE:
Hey, Betula! You should play the Efgnar this year.
BETULE:
Uncle. I’m not doing that again.
STAE:
Wait a minute, hang on. You played the Efgnar?
BETULE:
Yeah. So on Midwinter’s Night, someone dresses up as the Efgnar and roars at all the kids. Usually it was me, since I was the biggest.
STAE:
Oh wow! Do you think that maybe you could get dressed up again as the Efgnar?
BETULE:
No.
STAE:
C’mon! That would be so cool.
BETULE:
Why don’t you dress up as the Efgnar? You could show those little brats who’s boss.
STAE:
Really? Oh, sweet!
It sounds kinda mean, though.
BETULE:
Well, there’s always Üpsi-dag.
GUBBIE:
Heh heh, yeah.
STAE:
What’s that?
BETULE:
Upside Down Day. It’s a couple days before the solstice. They pick a foolish person from the village and make them supreme ruler.
STAE:
Okay, now that sounds like a role I was born to play.
GUBBIE:
Yeah! You’d be a prime candidate. You’d be waited on hand and foot. Your word would literally be law for the whole week leading up to the solstice!
STAE:
Aw, that is so cool! It’s about time old Stanway Gerard got what’s been coming to him.
GUBBIE:
Yes, yes, yes, we gotta do that. We gotta do that!
BETULE:
Well… Uncle’s leaving out the bit at the end where the supreme ruler is thrown off a cliff as a ritual sacrifice to Bu-Schkrinda, the god of tactful silence.
STAE:
I’m sorry, what?
GUBBIE:
Nobody does that any more.
BETULE:
Yes, they do!
GUBBIE:
Well, okay, but they put a net at the bottom now.
STAE:
Are all your customs completely terrifying?
GUBBIE:
Don’t worry, kid, there’s no good cliffs around here anyway.
Stan rolls up the last flag.
STAE:
All right. That’s all the flags and things down.
BETULE:
Thanks Stan.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. Good job.
STAE:
I’m declaring a brand new tradition here. Solstice is coming up, right? So we’re gonna have a party. Everyone’s gonna be invited. The whole neighbourhood. Trolls, humans, goblins, raccoons, whoever else. Doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from, you’re welcome here. Food and drink are all on me!
GUBBIE:
You sure I couldn’t interest you in Üpsi-dag?
Music sting.
INT. BAR—SOLSTICE NIGHE:
A raucous party: singing and laughter in the background.
BETULE:
Here you go, two more pints!
Stan staggers downstairs.
STAE:
(exhausted)
Hey Betula. How are we doing?
BETULE:
Stan! You okay there?
STAE:
Oh, yeah, yeah, I’ll live. Probably.
BETULE:
You took off the costume.
STAE:
Well, yeah. Not much point after the kids tore my head off. It was already a mess. You know, they really kick hard, those kids.
BETULE:
Stan, you’re supposed to roar.
STAE:
I did roar! But the one little guy screamed, and I felt so bad about scaring him.
BETULE:
That’s the whole point! You showed weakness, and they all ganged up on you.
STAE:
I know, I know. Next year, someone else is definitely playing the Efgnar.
BETULE:
No, no, you can do it. You just have to stay strong. And roar!
(to a customer)
Another round? Coming up.
She goes about pouring a few more pints.
STAE:
So? What’s your good fortune? Something that came true for you this year?
BETULE:
Oh, are we doing gluck-vin-oth?
STAE:
Sure!
BETULE:
I dunno. I guess I found something I’m good at. Bartending and, you know, being a broker. Knowing the right people and connecting them.
STAE:
That’s cool. You’ve really been making a name for yourself since you got here.
BETULE:
And if I have a New Year pledge… maybe it’s to stick around. Most of my life I’d spend a few months in one place and then get bored or get in trouble, and just run away somewhere else. It feels nice to finally stay put for a little while.
STAE:
I’m glad.
BETULE:
Yeah.
What about you?
STAE:
Oh, my good fortune? It’s the Axe and Crown. Everything about it.
BETULE:
I guess that’s sort of a gimme.
STAE:
Well, yeah. You know, when my dad died, I thought I was gonna follow in his footsteps. I was gonna sweep in and reinvent the whole hospitality industry. Have a whole chain of hotels. But… you know me. That’s not me. I really found a home here.
BETULE:
And what’s your big pledge for the new year? Make it big in magic?
STAE:
(laughs)
Naw. All this company-founding stuff, it’s fun, it’s great. Maybe it’ll make us money. Probably not. But well, look around.
See this? This is what I really want. I want to make a place for people. Everybody. I just want to take care of everyone, and help them have a good time.
BETULE:
Even if you get beat up a little?
STAE:
Heh. Maybe.
Please promise you’ll be the Efgnar next year.
BETULE:
I’ll think about it.
CUSTOMEE:
Excuse me. Excuse me! I ordered a pigeon pie some minutes ago.
BETULE:
Hang on, I’ll ask.
She pushes open the kitchen door.
BETULE:
(shouts)
Uncle? How’s that pie coming along?
GUBBIE:
(shouts)
Just gimme a minute.
BETULE:
Hey, we got orders piling up here, just so you know! Two plates of stonebread and a whole bunch of orders for stew.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, yeah, I’m working on it, all right?
BETULE:
Oh, you’re working on it! If you say so.
She returns to the bar.
BETULE:
Yeah, just a couple more minutes.
STAE:
Well, Gubbin’s not allowed to make fun of your cooking any more.
BETULE:
Right?
STAE:
Why isn’t he out here, by the way?
BETULE:
He wanted to swap. Said he’d had enough of people for the night.
STAE:
I kinda get that.
Maybe I should check on him. See if he needs any help.
BETULE:
Yeah, would you?
INT. KITCHEN—CONTINUOUE:
Fire crackles and food bubbles as Stan enters.
STAE:
Whoa, whoa, things on fire! Things on fire!
He rushes around putting lids on pots.
GUBBIE:
Stan, get out. Let a troll work!
STAE:
Gubbin, are you okay? We’ve got customers waiting for their…
Oh.
JOHANE:
Hey there.
STAE:
Johann.
GUBBIE:
Kid, we’re having a moment, all right?
JOHANE:
(purrs)
Mmm, aren’t we?
STAE:
I can see that. Probably a little risky having your shirt off in a kitchen full of bubbling pots and pans, don’t you think?
JOHANE:
It adds a little excitement to everything.
STAE:
Look, do you want me to take over? Why don’t you two just, uh, get a room and I’ll make the food?
GUBBIE:
Dammit, Stan…
STAE:
Our patrons need dinner and you guys are busy. Go.
GUBBIE:
All right, all right, all right.
JOHANE:
It’s probably safer for everyone, Gubs.
GUBBIE:
Okay. C’mon, Yo-yo. Let’s go.
Just lemme grab this spatula…
He heads out the door.
JOHANE:
Okay! Bye, um… Stan, is it?
STAE:
That’s right. Stan, yeah.
Stan steps in front of the door.
JOHANE:
Um, can I go upstairs now? I thought you were gonna take over.
STAE:
Yeah, I just… I wanted to say.
Whatever you and Gubbin get up to, that’s your business.
JOHANE:
Yeah. It is.
STAE:
But you know, you just… better tread carefully.
JOHANE:
Excuse me?
STAE:
Do you know how broken up he was over you?
JOHANE:
Yeah, yeah, apparently he was kind of a mess for a while.
STAE:
Yeah, that’s one way to put it, a mess.
He didn’t use the kitchen for months, did you know that? No one was even allowed in here. This room just sat gathering dust.
JOHANE:
Come on. Did he tell you that?
STAE:
Of course he didn’t tell me that. He’s Gubbin. He’s a big tough old troll. We had to break into this kitchen ourselves before he told us the whole story.
JOHANE:
Oh.
STAE:
So I just wanted you to know that… if you do anything to hurt him again, I will do terrible things to you.
JOHANE:
Says the guy who just got beaten up by a bunch of little kids.
STAE:
Yeah. Says that guy.
(low and dangerous)
So have fun. But you better be good to my friend, or I will kick your extremely handsome ass.
JOHANE:
That’s kinda hot.
STAE:
Sorry?
JOHANE:
Kidding! I’m kidding.
STAE:
I’m not.
JOHANE:
Kay.
STAE:
(cheery again)
Happy Solstice, Johann!
He turns away takes down a big frying pan.
JOHANE:
Happy Solstice.
Johann slips out the door.

Hey. Sean here, and Eli wanted to say thank you to each and every one of you, but also wish you a happy holiday. This has been such an amazing journey, and we couldn’t do it without all of you. So please accept our sincerest wishes for a joyous holiday for each and every one of you. And a super giant thank you to our supporting producers, Kim Bellinger, Ryan Cushman and Kona.
Our sponsor this week is Shaker & Spoon. I talked about it off the top—Eli and I ordered the first box, and had it shipped to some friends in Buffalo, and we went and had a crazy fun rum party cocktail evening. Shaker & Spoon is a subscription cocktail service where they send you a box every month. It’s so much fun because these are amazing drinks, and it’s crazy what’s packed into this box. All you have to add is the bottle of alcohol for that box. So we picked a rum box, but we picked a special Italian box for our next one, because we want to surprise some of our friends here in Hamilton with an Italian themed holiday party—I don’t know why it’s Italian. It’s just because I like prosecco. But hey, it’s gonna be super fun. And you can find out more and get $20 off your first box at shakerandspoon.com/albasalix.
And again, we wish you, with cocktails or without, a truly, truly, joyous holiday.

INT. BAR—MORNINE:
BETULE:
Hey Stan.
STAE:
Oh. Hey, Betula.
BETULE:
You okay there?
STAE:
Yeah, you know me, I’m—
No, actually, not really.
BETULE:
What’s up? Do you need a hand?
She takes a seat next to him.
STAE:
No…
BETULE:
Isn’t your new launch for Meals by Magic happening this week?
STAE:
No. I’m afraid Meals By Magic is done.
BETULE:
What? Why? What happened?
STAE:
I just found out Kalzak got… called away. He left a note, but it’s not very clear. Something about an unpaid debt or something.
BETULE:
Oh. That’s too bad. But why does that mean the company’s done? Isn’t he coming back?
STAE:
I don’t think so.
BETULE:
Wait. Are we talking “called away” to another dimension?
STAE:
Yeah. Look, over in the corner there, where he always sits, see? His chair’s gone and there’s just a scorched circle of runes on the floor.
BETULE:
Oh. Oh yeah, that’s not a good sign.
And Uncle’s gonna have a fit.
STAE:
Yeah. He already lost it on me. I’ll pay to repair it. I just… yeah.
BETULE:
That’s rough. I’m sorry, Stan.
STAE:
He was a good guy, really. Deep down, I mean. Yeah, he was strange, but also, you know… really strange.
BETULE:
Just to be clear, though—he’s not actually dead, right?
STAE:
I don’t think so? The note’s in his handwriting. I guess they just need him to pay back his eternal debt or something, whatever that means.
BETULE:
Oh. Yeah. That’s good, then. I’m sure he’s… fine.
STAE:
(reassured)
Yeah. Thanks, Betula.
BETULE:
Right.
Does he have next of kin? Do they need to be told?
STAE:
He’s got some family, but they’d been estranged for a long time.
BETULE:
That tracks.
STAE:
Gubbin’s upstairs sorting through his stuff. I’ll ask if he can find a name or an address or something.
Gubbin comes downstairs, followed by a rattling, flapping noise.
NEE:
Grawk!
GUBBIE:
Okay, can someone please deal with this goddamn bird? Stop it!
BETULE:
What is that?
STAE:
Oh, that’s another thing. This is Kalzak’s… friend, Nev.
NEE:
Rawk! Not any more!
STAE:
Nev, Betula. Betula, this is Nev.
BETULE:
Hi?
NEE:
Rark!
STAE:
I think Kalzak raised him as part of this big thesis project when he was at school, and he’s just been taking care of him ever since.
NEE:
Not any more! Caw!
GUBBIE:
Agh!
So when you say “raised”, I’m guessing you don’t mean raised from a baby.
STAE:
Yeah, more like raised from… a skeleton.
GUBBIE:
Uh huh.
BETULE:
A skeleton with eyes. That’s the part that’s creeping me out.
STAE:
Yeah, I get that. You know, hanging out with a previously-alive raven, takes some getting used to, but Kal was really fond of him.
NEE:
Not any more!
BETULE:
Does he say anything else?
STAE:
Not that I’ve heard. I think maybe it’s a punchline to an old joke that Kal taught him?
BETULE:
Yeah, that’s… pretty funny.
NEE:
Not any more!
GUBBIE:
Yeah, you try sleeping with that going on in the room above you.
NEE:
Rawwk!
GUBBIE:
Gah!
This is typical. Frickin’ wizards, disappearing and leaving us with their weird familiars.
BETULE:
Yeah, gosh, ’cause that happens so often.
GUBBIE:
Oh, you weren’t here when that sea witch was here with her friend the squid. I had half a dozen guests yelling in my face that the cleaning staff stole all their jewellery.
BETULE:
Wait a minute. When did you ever have cleaning staff?
GUBBIE:
I didn’t! It was the squid! It kept sneaking out of her room during the day. She would lock all the doors and windows but if there was even the tiniest crack—I’m talking infinitesimal—that squid could still squeeze out.
STAE:
What! That’s amazing.
GUBBIE:
And she wouldn’t even correct him. She was all like, “Oh, what a clever boy you are. Isn’t he clever? Blah blah blah!”
Bah. Squids! You can’t trust ’em!
NEE:
Not any more!
GUBBIE:
I swear, we should just ban ’em all from the premises. No pets, no wizards, no witches, no familiars, no nothing.
STAE:
Aw, c’mon, Gub. You can’t let one poorly-raised squid spoil everything.
GUBBIE:
Pah!
STAE:
Look. I’ll take care of him. Unless either of you wants to?
BETULE:
Well, I can’t exactly cook him. There’s no meat on him.
NEE:
Not any more!
STAE:
That’s not actually what I meant. I’ll keep him in my room or something.
BETULE:
Oh, sorry.
So then… what does he eat, exactly?
STAE:
Nothing, as far as I can tell.
BETULE:
I mean, no stomach.
STAE:
Yeah.
BETULE:
So, did you find an address in Kal’s room, Uncle? Stan wants to reach out to his relatives.
GUBBIE:
Nah. He’s got books and books and notebooks and books of notes, all written in code, or maybe some kinda demon language, maybe both? I don’t know.
STAE:
Nev? Do you know where Kal’s family are?
NEE:
Dawk! Not any more!
GUBBIE:
Well, this is gonna be heaps of fun.
Music sting.
INT. BAR—DA:
Stan enters from the street.
STAE:
Okay, so some good news. Grandville University of Thaumaturgical Elucidation still had Kal’s emergency contact info on file from when he was a student. They’re trying to contact his family now.
BETULE:
Well, that’s good news.
STAE:
Also, they want me to explain what happened and I’m not sure what to tell them.
BETULE:
Well, his family knew he was going to the University, so they probably knew he was doing weird magic.
STAE:
Yeah, I don’t think they approved.
BETULE:
What makes you say that?
STAE:
Kal told me his mother didn’t approve.
BETULE:
Right.
Hey… his latest research and stuff, that probably belonged to your company, right?
STAE:
Hmm? Oh, we never really discussed that. I guess we were just too excited about designing the product.
BETULE:
But it’s not like anyone’s going to come looking for his prototype magical transportation boxes or anything.
STAE:
Probably not. Why?
BETULE:
Well, I’m just saying, we should probably keep those safe. Just in case Kal gets back and wants to continue working on them.
STAE:
Sure. I guess.
BETULE:
Cool. Cool cool cool.
STAE:
Not like it matters. There really wasn’t anything new or groundbreaking about what we were doing. We were just a couple of clueless dudes messing around with magic and convincing ourselves we were doing something special.
BETULE:
Aw, Stan. You never know. I thought you guys were really on to something.
NEE:
Awk! Not any more!
STAE:
Gee, thanks Nev.
Any luck finding a foster home for Mister Bone Bird over here?
BETULE:
Not yet. I contacted a couple of sanctuaries, but they’re not taking in any new animals and/or skeletons. So no one at the university was interested?
STAE:
No. I think they have some weird superstition about inheriting someone else’s familiar.
BETULE:
Heh. What, like history might repeat itself and they might end up dragged away to a hell dimension like Kal?
STAE:
Yeah, sure, that sort of thing.
BETULE:
I don’t suppose we could release him back into the wild?
NEE:
Not any more!
STAE:
No, I don’t think so. Turns out he doesn’t eat, but he sure does like to drink, though. Speaking of, do you know where to get some formaldehyde? Kal had a bottle of it in his room, but—
NEE:
(belches)
Not any more!
STAE:
We pretty much toasted that.
BETULE:
You could ask at Gurney’s Funeral Home? Or the alchemist’s over on Bridge Street.
Gubbin comes downstairs. Nev stalks over and flaps angrily.
NEE:
Rawwk!
GUBBIE:
Agh! Haven’t you got rid of that damn bird yet?
NEE:
Rawwk!
STAE:
Not yet.
GUBBIE:
He’s freaking out all my patrons, and honestly, he’s freaking me out too.
BETULE:
We’re working on it.
GUBBIE:
Can’t you make a bone broth out of him or something?
NEE:
Rawwwwwk!
BETULE:
Uh, would you eat soup made from a formaldehyde-soaked undead bird?
GUBBIE:
…I’m sure someone would.
STAE:
Maybe the funeral home needs a mascot or something. “Welcome to Gurney’s! Raawk!”
NEE:
Aawwwk!
GUBBIE:
You know what, maybe call a taxidermist. Stick him up on the wall.
NEE:
Awwk! Not any more!
GUBBIE:
Come here, you!
He chases Nev around the room, chairs thud to the floor.
NEE:
Not any more! Not any more!
GUBBIE:
I swear to God.
STAE:
Can you guys take it outside?
NEE:
Awwk!
INT. BAR—NIGHE:
The bar is empty. Betula is putting chairs up on tables while Stan sweeps the floor.
STAE:
How you doing?
BETULE:
(yawns)
All right. I’m gonna turn in or I’m gonna be useless for brunch tomorrow.
STAE:
Sure, I got the rest. Night, Betula.
BETULE:
Night, Stan.
She heads upstairs.
The outside door rattles, and creaks open.
STAE:
Betula, I thought you said you locked up?
Footsteps slowly enter.
STAE:
Uh… sorry, friend, we’re closed for the night.
The door creaks shut and slams.
YARTHE:
(deep, sinister, hissing voice)
You… know… Kalzak.
Yartha stalks over to the bar, looking over Stan.
STAE:
He was staying here for a little bit, yeah.
Uh, uh, hi, hello, can I help you?
YARTHE:
You must be Stanway.
STAE:
(backing away)
Oh! Well, yes. Yes I am. Stanway Gerrard. But how did you…
YARTHE:
My son wrote to us a few times in the past months and he spoke of a young man he was working with, a Stanway Gerrard.
STAE:
That would be me, yes. Stan is fine.
YARTHE:
Stan, then.
STAE:
So you’re Kal’s…?
YARTHE:
I am his mother. You may call me Yartha.
STAE:
Yartha! That is a nice name. Yeah, I can see a little of the family resemblance there—
YARTHE:
Where did it happen?
STAE:
Oh, right. “It”, yes. Um, “it” happened right over here. Where the… um…
YARTHE:
Where the scorch marks are.
STAE:
Yes, yes. And I found this note here.
He hands it to Yartha.
YARTHE:
We knew it would come to this one day. And yet I find myself unprepared.
Silence.
STAE:
If there’s anything that I can do…
YARTHE:
Yes. I am here to collect my son’s worldly goods.
STAE:
Oh. Sure. Sure. Sure. Well. Follow me. Right this way, I’ll show you to his room.
They ascend the stairs to the third floor.
STAE:
So, uh, I don’t know much about you. He didn’t talk much about his family.
YARTHE:
Of course not.
STAE:
Are you in the… magic business as well? What is it that you do?
YARTHE:
I am not in the magic business.
Stan unlocks the door, and they step inside.
STAE:
Fair enough. So this is Kal’s room. Was Kal’s room. Is. Is Kal’s room. Still is, it’s completely his room, I guess, since he’s only gone away.
So, uh…
YARTHE:
To answer your question, I specialize in early childhood education.
Silence.
STAE:
You’re… really! I would not have guessed that.
YARTHE:
You find my appearance atypical for a teacher.
STAE:
Maybe a little?
YARTHE:
Do I frighten you?
STAE:
I’m terrified. I have to let you know, I am currently extremely terrified.
YARTHE:
That is excellent.
STAE:
Okay, that’s fine.
The hood thing. Arriving in the middle of the night. The claws.
YARTHE:
Children today are too coddled. Their parents try to shield them from any fear, any pain, any tiny inconvenience—any experience that would teach them to live in the real world.
STAE:
And so you, uh, frighten them?
YARTHE:
My partner and I run a night camp in the Woeful Woods where children can safely become lost, be menaced by monsters and villains, and then escape, hungry but unharmed, back to their parent or guardian as wiser, more capable people.
STAE:
That’s kind of amazing. So… Kal didn’t exactly follow in your footsteps.
YARTHE:
We made many mistakes as parents. We did too much for him. He never learned to make his own way. We sent him off to Hazelbroke College, where he turned to begging favours from dark forces. At first it was help on a pop quiz here and there, but then it was a term paper, or a major research project.
STAE:
Oh no.
YARTHE:
Soon he was promising everything to his so-called “friends” below just to avoid his turn cleaning the common room. He dropped out of college, applied to that awful university, dropped out of university—I’m afraid that’s when he stopped talking to us. Until recently.
STAE:
Oh. I’m sorry—that’s really sad.
YARTHE:
And now the only sign of his presence is a heap of arcane diagrams and a scorched circle on the floor.
I’m sorry about that, by the way—can we help pay for some of the damage?
STAE:
Oh, no, no, that’s awfully nice of you. You don’t have to—we deal with damage from our guests every day.
YARTHE:
People are so inconsiderate.
STAE:
I know.
YARTHE:
No, allow me to offer you some recompense. Skies above, he could have burned down the building on his way out.
STAE:
No, really—
YARTHE:
Take the money, Stanway Gerrard.
STAE:
Y‑yes, Ma’am. Yes. Thank you very much.
She gives him a bag of coins.
YARTHE:
My son spoke quite highly of you, you know.
STAE:
He did? Really?
YARTHE:
You were colleagues, yes?
STAE:
We were just working together. And not on any summoning type thing. Or I don’t think it was anything like that.
YARTHE:
You gave him hope. He spoke of moving away from the darker arts. He said that you believed in him. Trusted him.
STAE:
Well, yeah, I…
YARTHE:
I fear that we stopped trusting, long ago.
STAE:
I don’t know what to say.
YARTHE:
Do not be troubled. We loved him. We still do. But there were so many times we wanted to believe that he was returning to us. Only to lose him further down the path he had chosen. And now, this is where we find ourselves.
STAE:
I’m sorry things didn’t work out better.
YARTHE:
Perhaps they will in the end. Who can say? Life is full of delight and disappointment, and not often in equal share. I am glad you were there for my Kalzak.
STAE:
Thanks. Me too.
YARTHE:
Your magic food delivery business gave him hope. And you gave him friendship.
STAE:
I’d like to think so.
Yartha sifts through a few of the items.
YARTHE:
I wish we had done more.
STAE:
We always do. We always wish we’d done more for our friends and our family.
YARTHE:
We failed him.
STAE:
You don’t know that. Maybe if you’d done the “right” thing, quote unquote, he’d have turned out exactly the same. You can’t ever know for sure.
YARTHE:
Perhaps. But it is the reason I now do what I do.
STAE:
You mean, teaching kids by frightening them out of their wits.
YARTHE:
Indeed.
STAE:
Well, there you go—think of all those kids you’ve helped. It probably would have done me some good, I’ll tell you. I coulda used an experience like that to give me a little backbone. A little smarts.
YARTHE:
That is kind of you to say.
STAE:
So… do you want me to help you pack up all his stuff? I mean, these are all his notes from the business but I can’t read a word of them.
YARTHE:
If you have a place to keep these notes, then keep them. I have no use for them. Ah! But look—he kept this lantern. This we gave him when he left home.
Perhaps—yes. I believe I will take this.
What is under this sheet?
STAE:
Oh, no, don’t—
Yartha pulls a sheet from a cage.
NEE:
Rark!
YARTHE:
Oh! What a charming beast! Greetings!
STAE:
This is Nev—Nev, this is Yartha.
NEE:
Raaark!
YARTHE:
I am delighted to meet you too, dear Nev—or, pardon me, Rark!
NEE:
Raark raark caw!
STAE:
You speak raven?
YARTHE:
I speak a dialect. Nev is a coastal raven—
NEE:
Not any more!
YARTHE:
Oh, indeed, was a coastal raven, but I can understand most of what he says.
STAE:
Would you be interested in taking home a… new skeletal bird friend?
NEE:
Caw! Caw?
YARTHE:
He would be a terrifying addition to our staff. Yes! I will certainly take you, if you like. Will you come with us, Nev?
NEE:
Damn right! Finally!
STAE:
Woo hoo!
NEE:
Caw!
INT. BAR—EARLY MORNINE:
Betula, Gubbin and Stan are setting up the tables for brunch service.
STAE:
Tablecloths and placemats are done. How we coming on the silverware?
BETULE:
(yawning)
Slow down there, bronco. I’m on it. There’s plenty of time before the brunch crowd arrives.
GUBBIE:
You can help me with the plates.
STAE:
Okay.
GUBBIE:
Thank the gods that bird is gone.
STAE:
Yeah. He and Kalzak’s mom took to each other pretty fast.
GUBBIE:
Well… she was probably right. You were good for Kalzak.
STAE:
Aw, thanks, Gubbin.
BETULE:
Yeah, the last couple weeks, before he went away, I think I actually saw him in a fresh robe once or twice.
A magical whoosh.
STAE:
I wish I had done more. I didn’t realize how important this business was to him.
GUBBIE:
Sometimes what you can do is what you can do.
BETULE:
(sniffs)
Does anyone else smell something burning?
A soft crackling noise, slowly growing into a substantial fire.
STAE:
There’s no food on yet, right?
GUBBIE:
Stan! Table three on fire!
STAE:
It’s the tablecloth! I got it. Ow! Ow! Water! We need water!
Betula heaves a bucket of sand, and the flames go out instantly.
BETULE:
Sand is better. There we go. Everything’s fine.
GUBBIE:
Everything is NOT fine! No more candles at brunch!
STAE:
The candles weren’t lit.
GUBBIE:
No candles, no flambé, no burning anything! I got half a mind to get rid of the stove too!
BETULE:
No, no, it’s that circle in the corner again.
STAE:
The circle?!
BETULE:
The one that took Kal away! That one.
GUBBIE:
It’s back?! Goddammit, we just cleaned that up.
STAE:
But nobody disappeared this time… right?
BETULE:
No—something appeared.
STAE:
What?
BETULE:
A postcard?
STAE:
Let me see!
GUBBIE:
That’s it. How the hell do we get rid of a pentagram?
STAE:
(reading with difficulty)
“Dear Stan. Sorry had to bail. Big rush, no time. Working…” Here, hold on, does that say “desk job”?
BETULE:
I think so.
STAE:
“Working desk job, so much paperwork, but I’ll live, ha ha. Sorry about food biz. Talk soon. Peace—Kal.”
BETULE:
Wow. He’s alive. And at a desk job?
GUBBIE:
Yup, he’s in hell for sure.
STAE:
I’m thinking we shouldn’t seat anyone at Table 3 for a while.
GUBBIE:
Good idea. Put a cloth over it. A big one.

What is the deal with cart food?
Laughter.
STAN (ART CARLSON)
You know what I’m saying? Every time you’re on a cart between villages, you just get the same food over and over again. And it’s terrible! Like for example, every time I’m on a cart, they bring you a little piece of meat and it has grill marks on it. What am I supposed to imagine? That they have an open flame grill at the front of the cart that I…? It makes no sense. Anyway! I’m gonna be here all week. G’night!

INT. BAR—MORNINE:
Stan enters from the street.
STAE:
Morning, guys!
GUBBIE:
Hey Stan.
BETULE:
Hey Stan. How was the market?
Stan starts going through his shopping bags.
STAE:
So good. I got some amazing cheeses for brunch tomorrow, I got some new candles for the tables—especially for Table 3. Oh, and I met this amazing woman who’s running for town council.
GUBBIE:
I’m confused.
STAE:
About what?
GUBBIE:
You used “amazing” and “running for council” in the same sentence.
Stan pulls out a pamphlet.
STAE:
Ha ha ha. Look, I’m being serious. Her name’s Constance Moldvay and she’s all about making the city safer for everyone. Better roads and sewers, cracking down on polluting industries. I told her we’d vote for her!
GUBBIE:
Now, see, there are three things wrong with that statement. First of all, you ain’t me, and you don’t get to say who I vote for.
STAE:
Yeah, sorry, I just got overexcited.
GUBBIE:
Especially because secondly, I don’t vote.
STAE:
Wait, what? What? Gubbin, you have to vote.
GUBBIE:
Councillors, they’re all the same. They say they’re gonna stop corruption and help the poor and bla de bla de bla. And then they get elected and whoops, it all just slipped outta their mind. And the rare time they do come up with a good idea, the King and/or Queen suddenly decides nope! Can’t possibly do that!
So what good are they?
STAE:
Listen, Constance is different. She gets things done. Look, it says it right here on the pamphlet. See? She gets things done.
GUBBIE:
I see that.
STAE:
Do you remember when Pomfritz’s Potions were dumping their effluent into the river?
BETULE:
Geez. That sounds bad.
GUBBIE:
You kidding? It was great! That big outbreak of flying fish? You could walk out the front door here and catch ’em without a boat! We were serving those up all summer.
STAE:
Yeah, but it wasn’t just the fish. Do you know how many kids were born with three eyes that year?
BETULE:
Is that where they all came from? I was wondering.
GUBBIE:
Hey, it was great for the hat business here in town. Hiding all those third eyes, they had to pull ’em down low… they looked really fashionable, those kids.
STAE:
It’s worse that all that. It turns out old Mister Pomfritz was good buddies with the Lord Mayor. So no one was doing anything about the dumping—except Constance Moldvay! She led a big protest outside the town hall. “Keep our river clean! Nix the elixir mixers!” They had to clean up or move out of town!
BETULE:
So they cleaned up?
STAE:
No, they moved out of town. All their potions are brewed in Balgomar now.
BETULE:
Yeah, that figures.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. Too bad for all the folks that worked there.
STAE:
The point is, it worked. No more third eyes, no more fires breaking out on the river.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hooray for Constance.
STAE:
And that’s why I’m voting for her.
GUBBIE:
No you’re not. Which brings me to my third point. This pamphlet says Ward Two. You’re living on the other side of the river now, kid.
STAE:
Oh darn, you’re right. I didn’t even think about that! Wait. What ward are we in, anyway?
GUBBIE:
Ward Seven, South Shore—Bogtown.
STAE:
And who’s our current councillor?
GUBBIE:
Mister Duffin Braithwick. Used to run a big shipping company down at the docks. He’s been on the council for about a thousand years. Barely shows up for meetings any more, just collects his pay and goes off to play golf his developer buddies.
STAE:
Ugh.
GUBBIE:
Drives me nuts!
STAE:
We need someone like Constance to run in our ward.
BETULE:
Huh. You ever think about running for council, Uncle?
GUBBIE:
I had not considered it, no.
STAE:
People would totally vote for you! You’re a fixture in this neighbourhood. This place is a beloved institution.
GUBBIE:
Hah. If you say so.
STAE:
I do say so.
GUBBIE:
You think I got time to sit on my butt in the council chambers listening to speeches about sewage treatment options?
BETULE:
You said the incumbent guy never shows up to council meetings.
GUBBIE:
Let alone getting out there shaking hands and smiling big fake smiles for the voters.
STAE:
Aw, c’mon, Gubbin.
BETULE:
What about you, Stan?
STAE:
Me?
BETULE:
You’re a prominent local business owner now. You’re Head of Innovation, overseeing the transformation of the Axe and Crown.
STAE:
Oh well, you know. I mean, sure, I try, but… thank you, thats—I don’t know anything about politics, so it’s…
GUBBIE:
Stan doesn’t have the nerve for politics. I think of him as a soft little bunny man.
STAE:
Okay…
GUBBIE:
You put him in a debate against a throw pillow and I guarantee you, ten minutes in he’s gonna say, “Oh yeah, right, Mister Pillow! I didn’t see it that way before! I better take a nap.”
BETULE:
Uncle.
GUBBIE:
Am I wrong?
STAE:
No no no, you’re not wrong. And I love pillows. They’re so nice.
GUBBIE:
They are, aren’t they?
STAE:
How about you, Betula? You’ve got more nerve than me, that’s for sure. And you follow goings-on in the neighbourhood, right?
BETULE:
Well, I like to keep up to date, but politics isn’t really my wheelhouse either.
STAE:
You’d be great, though! You’re down-to-earth, forthright, honest…
GUBBIE:
(laughs)
STAE:
I mean, how does this Braithwick guy keep getting elected? Is he just a real likeable guy?
GUBBIE:
You kidding? Everyone hates his guts. His family employs a ton of people, but meanwhile he’s been trying to undermine the guilds for years.
BETULE:
You’d think they’d be organizing against him.
GUBBIE:
They are! But that’s where money talks. He’s got a million crowns from the shipping business and who knows how many other big companies lining his pockets. He can outspend his opponents a hundred to one.
BETULE:
Really.
STAE:
Yeah, running for office is expensive. There’s printing, signs, staffing…
GUBBIE:
Paying off the right people at the Palace and Town Hall.
BETULE:
And these companies are paying how much to finance him?
GUBBIE:
Thousands. Tens of thousands. Not to mention all the wine and carriages and trips to Melluria…
BETULE:
Nice work if you can get it. The question is, how to get it.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. Wait, you’re not thinking of running, are you?
STAE:
Why not? Betula could totally get in!
BETULE:
I don’t know. I’d need a platform if I was gonna run.
STAE:
Woo hoo!
BETULE:
If.
GUBBIE:
You’re actually considering it.
BETULE:
Just hypothetically.
STAE:
Hypothetical woo hoo!
GUBBIE:
Hypothetically… start with cutting back property taxes, eh? Essie over on Anchor Street, she’s about to lose her deli ’cause she can’t keep up.
BETULE:
These new places can afford to pay, though. Like the Badger and Bucket. Maybe anyone new who buys into the neighbourhood gets the new rate?
STAE:
That is nice thinking! I like that.
Miss Betula, what about road safety? That’s a big thing in Constance’s plan. Do you have any proposals?
BETULE:
Uh, like better street lighting?
STAE:
Yeah. The number of times I’ve nearly broken my neck on those cobblestones…
GUBBIE:
Or that one night you got both your boots stuck in the mud and came home barefoot?
STAE:
Exactly. Not to mention all the muggings and the pickpocketing that goes on around here at night. We have got to do something about that.
BETULE:
(guilty)
Yeah, definitely. Damn those thieves.
STAE:
What else? What does Braithwick usually run on?
GUBBIE:
Jobs.
BETULE:
And?
GUBBIE:
That’s it.
STAE:
I guess that makes sense.
But how do we outdo him on that? “More jobs”? “Better jobs”? “Shinier jobs”?
GUBBIE:
Well, when it comes to jobs, Betula’s got quite the track record. If you count the forgery, fencing and professional kleptomania.
STAE:
Well…
BETULE:
I think we’re talking about making jobs for other people, Uncle.
GUBBIE:
Eh, you gotta help yourself before you can help anybody else, right? Heh heh. That’s my motto.
Music sting.
INT. BAR—A FEW DAYS LATEE:
Betula consults a piece of paper.
BETULE:
So, it looks like we’ve got five candidates in the running. There’s me, Duffin Braithwick and three others. Vincenzo Funk wants tuition cuts and a freeze on swan boat fares.
GUBBIE:
Aa, he’s just a kid. He’s not gonna be a threat this time.
BETULE:
Grunelda Blank…
GUBBIE:
(laughs)
Is she running again? Oh, good old Grunelda.
BETULE:
Her platform seems to be pretty much down to “restrict the number of cats—”
BETULA AND GUBBIE:
“—living in one house”.
GUBBIE:
It’s basically a feud between her and her neighbour. She’s run for council about a dozen times.
BETULE:
And finally, we got Jane Tolliveri. Schoolteacher, really focused on getting rid of corruption at Town Hall. So, potential danger there.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. You’re taking this more seriously than I thought.
BETULE:
Eh, it’s fun. It’s kind of like casing the joint before you break in and steal—
She stops herself as the door opens and Stan enters.
BETULE:
Oh, hey Stan.
STAE:
Hey guys! I got our posters printed up. Look at this.
He pulls out a big poster.
STAE:
“Vote Betula!”
GUBBIE:
(unimpressed)
Wow.
BETULE:
Is that supposed to be me?
STAE:
Yeah, well, we were in a hurry and you weren’t there to pose for the portrait, so I just described you.
GUBBIE:
That explains why you’re wearing a suit.
STAE:
I thought it would be good if you looked, y’know, kinda professional.
BETULE:
I mean, it’s not a bad look.
GUBBIE:
“Keep the South Side Affordable”. Hard to argue with that slogan.
BETULE:
What am I holding?
STAE:
A baby.
GUBBIE:
(laughing)
That’s a baby? Why is it wearing a suit?
BETULE:
Oh no. That’s supposed to be a troll baby, isn’t it?
STAE:
Well, it didn’t seem right to put you on a poster holding someone else’s baby, so…
GUBBIE:
(chuckling)
BETULE:
And now everyone’s going to think I’m a mom.
STAE:
I just thought holding a baby would make you seem more trustworthy and approachable.
BETULE:
Stop laughing. Stop it.
Fine, if that’s what it takes.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, it might “resonate” with the parents out there.
STAE:
Yes. Exactly!
GUBBIE:
Definitely the ones with really ugly kids.
BETULE:
Yeah. Yeah. It looks a little like a tiny Gubbin.
GUBBIE:
(still laughing)
Can’t be me, it’s wearing a suit.
STAE:
Okay team! What do you say? Time to get out there and slap some posters on walls?
BETULE:
There’ll be someone getting slapped, all right.
Music sting.
INT. BAR—LATEE:
The door opens and Gubbin, Betula and Stan enter from the street.
BETULE:
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. This is all new to me. I didn’t realize the campaign was already on.
STAE:
The campaign is always on, Betula!
BETULE:
I mean, no one’s ever walked up to me and asked me point blank like that before.
GUBBIE:
You sure surprised that guy, though. “How do we know you’re not a crook like all the rest?”
BETULE:
Yeah. What was I supposed to do?
STAE:
Well, tell him in glorious detail all about your exploits as a professional thief, apparently.
BETULE:
You said the whole idea behind this campaign was honesty.
GUBBIE:
An honest image. There’s a huge difference between that and actual honesty.
BETULE:
So, lie and then lie about lying.
GUBBIE:
As usual.
STAE:
Oh man, I suddenly feel kinda sick to my stomach.
When did you steal an antique carriage full of jewels, anyway?
BETULE:
Couple months ago. It was parked right outside the Palace, too.
STAE:
Betula!
BETULE:
Stan, I worked for a Meyurian gangster. I’ve done a lot more than steal a few things.
STAE:
Oh geez, I don’t want to know this.
GUBBIE:
Oh, it’s fine, Stan. You saw that guy. He was impressed.
STAE:
Yeah, but if word gets out…
GUBBIE:
We’ll be fine. We just gotta spin it the right way.
STAE:
Spin it? Spin it how?
GUBBIE:
Well, we’re in Ward Seven. It’s a rough neighbourhood. What percentage of the people out there haven’t been tempted to steal a little something now and then?
STAE:
I think that you will find that most of our neighbours are honest, hard-working folks.
BETULE:
Gubbin’s right. They’re also gonna understand the pressures someone faces living here, and that it may lead them to take on activities that are not on their face… legal.
GUBBIE:
Well said. Well said, niece o’ mine.
STAE:
(unconvinced)
I mean, I guess it shows initiative and… what could we say? It shows organization?
BETULE:
Yes! Absolutely. It took six of us to pull off that carriage job, and it needed days of planning.
GUBBIE:
Oh, that’s good, that’s good. A proven track record of management and leadership.
BETULE:
A team player. But decisive.
STAE:
I don’t like this any more.
BETULE:
It’s okay, Stan. You don’t have to be out there doing the talking.
STAE:
But talking is what I’m good at! Lying, not so much.
GUBBIE:
Well then, just believe what we tell you, and repeat it to whoever you meet.
STAE:
Oh boy.
GUBBIE:
I’ll tell you, this is how we attract the big money to our campaign.
STAE:
I’m gonna go see if the printer has our pamphlets ready yet.
He heads out.
GUBBIE:
(sighs)
Ah, geez. What are we gonna do with that kid?
BETULE:
He’ll be fine. Stan’s always fine. He just gets nervous when we try something new.
GUBBIE:
Like tell the truth?
BETULE:
(laughs)
Yeah. The look on that fella’s face.
GUBBIE:
(laughing)
I actually thought his eyes might fall out.
BETULE:
I am starting to like this running for office thing.
GUBBIE:
It’s more fun than I thought.
Well, I believe I shall freshen up before the afternoon rush starts.
BETULE:
All right. I’ll get these posters and things out of the way.
Gubbin heads upstairs and Betula sets to work.
The front door opens.
BETULE:
Oh hey, we’re not open until 4:30.
STRANGEE:
Oh, I’m not looking for a drink. Are you Betula?
BETULE:
Yeah. That’s me.
STRANGEE:
Forgive me. You don’t look exactly like your posters.
BETULE:
Sure. Can I help you?
STRANGEE:
Yes, we’d like to talk about how we could assist you with your campaign.
BETULE:
That’s awfully nice of you. When you say “we”—who exactly is that?
The stranger produces a business card.
STRANGEE:
Stuart Bathbridge. I represent Mysticorp Energy. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Betula.

Episode 6: Back Room Deals.
INT. BAR—AFTERNOOE:
A boisterous after-work crowd. Gubbin is frantically filling tankards.
PATROE:
Hey Gubbin! What happened to those beers?
GUBBIE:
I’m comin’, I’m comin’, cool your jets!
Betula emerges from the back room.
BETULE:
Hey Uncle. How’s it going out here?
GUBBIE:
I’m moving my tushy off! Gosh. It’s Friday, and folks are thirsty.
BETULE:
Yeah, sorry, I had an appointment.
GUBBIE:
I saw. So, who’s this new friend of yours?
BETULE:
Friend?
GUBBIE:
That guy you were chatting with in the back room. Didn’t look like one of your usual contacts.
BETULE:
True, Stuart kinda stands out around here, doesn’t he.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, wearing a suit like that, I figure he’s either a fancy client, or someone with an interest in your election bid.
BETULE:
Good guess. Yeah, we’ve met a couple of times. He’s been giving me some information on our incumbent.
GUBBIE:
Oh yeah? Like how that little creep keeps getting elected?
BETULE:
Exactly. Funny thing about Duffin Braithwick. A couple of challengers who ran against him ended up, you know…
GUBBIE:
Slightly waterlogged, yeah.
SECOND PATROE:
Another pint, my good man.
GUBBIE:
Yep.
(back to Betula)
But that was years ago.
BETULE:
Yeah. I guess the disappearances got a little too much attention from the press and the town guard. So Braithwick’s turned to other methods. These days it’s a lot of intimidation outside polling stations, and a little bit of magical ballot-stuffing.
GUBBIE:
Hah! I knew it.
BETULE:
Apparently he’s found a way of getting around all the safeguards.
GUBBIE:
Here you go.
SECOND PATROE:
Excellent.
GUBBIE:
Sounds like something the press needs to hear about.
BETULE:
Absolutely.
THIRD CUSTOMEE:
I’ll have another half-pint of the dark ale, please?
BETULE:
Coming up!
She fills a tankard.
GUBBIE:
You find all this out from your Mister Suit?
BETULE:
A lot of it. Stuart’s been very helpful.
GUBBIE:
What’s his deal, anyway? Sure didn’t look like Guild.
BETULE:
No, he’s a rep for Mysticorp Energy.
GUBBIE:
Oh, big new money. Hmm. So Mysticorp want Braithwick out, huh? Interesting. Wonder what he did to tick them off.
BETULE:
Yeah, it’s not like he’s a competitor.
(to customer)
Here you go.
She slides the tankard over. Coins clink.
THIRD CUSTOMEE:
Thanks, Betula!
GUBBIE:
So has “Stuart” said what he wants from you?
BETULE:
No, I guess it’s just future consideration if I actually get on council.
GUBBIE:
You gotta be careful what you promise.
BETULE:
I haven’t promised anything.
GUBBIE:
Has he promised you anything? Or has it all been just dirt on the opposition?
BETULE:
Mostly dirt, but he did say he’s very keen to see Braithwick go down.
The door opens and Stan hurries in.
STAE:
Hey! Guys! You’re not gonna believe this. Look!
GUBBIE:
What’s this?
STAE:
It’s a new pamphlet from Constance. You know Mysticorp, the big magical energy company?
BETULE:
I… know of them.
STAE:
Well, get this. They’re trying to run a transmission line for magical energy right through our ward!
BETULE:
Is that a bad thing?
STAE:
“Is that a bad thing?” Big time.
You think the potion dumping was dangerous—this is gonna run straight along the waterfront and under the Lookout Bridge, all the way to downtown. Anywhere they run these transmission lines, there’s earthquakes, there’s freak weather events, cats with opposable thumbs…
BETULE:
Geez, that is scary.
STAE:
Right? We’ve gotta put a stop to this project! Down with Mysticorp!
GUBBIE:
Well, this just got interesting.
STAE:
Oh, this is gonna be the issue that decides this election. They’re gonna be trying to influence the candidates to get this project pushed through. We must be vigilant.
BETULE:
(awkward)
Sure.
INT BAR—MORNINE:
STAE:
All right, team! Time to get on the old campaign trail.
BETULE:
Thanks for doing this, Stan.
STAE:
You bet! Brunch can wait. Democracy is way more important than mere peanut butter waffles.
GUBBIE:
Yup, enjoy yourselves. Good luck pretending that meeting people is fun and worthwhile.
BETULE:
You’re always a help, Uncle.
GUBBIE:
I know you’re thinking it.
Stan brings out two bags.
STAE:
Look, I got us matching satchels to hold all our brochures.
BETULE:
Aw, thanks Stan.
(she tries one)
The strap’s a little short.
STAE:
Oh, sorry. Yeah. Troll thing. I guess maybe you can sling it over one arm?
A sudden burst of cheering from outside.
GUBBIE:
The hell’s going on out there?
BETULE:
Some kind of street festival? They’re putting up a ton of banners.
STAE:
They’re what?
He runs to the front door and opens it.
GUBBIE:
Street festival?
(squints)
“A Taste of Mud Street”. Ha, of course. Look—sponsored by all the Bucket Pubs.
Stan returns.
STAE:
All right, this is really the last straw!
GUBBIE:
Yeah, I’m sick of the Badger and Bucket—it’s one public nuisance after another with them.
STAE:
They organized this whole amazing festival and they didn’t tell us. Other places up and down the street are setting up tables and music stages.
GUBBIE:
Argh! Always with the goddamn musicians!
Stan closes the door.
STAE:
That Dorothea, she probably planned this for the weekend before election day because she knew we’d be campaigning. They’re gonna sell food all day and make a killing, and here’s us with nothing!
BETULE:
I guess this is payback for those firecrackers we sent them disguised as candles?
GUBBIE:
Aaa, let ’em have their stupid festival.
STAE:
No no no no no, we can do this, we can do this. Hold on. I’m Head of Innovation. Let me think this through. We’re gonna… okay, we’re gonna move some tables outside, and we’re gonna figure out where to get some food at the last minute, we’re gonna…
Silence.
GUBBIE:
Uh huh?
STAE:
We’re gonna…
BETULE:
Look like chumps.
STAE:
Aw, man.
Wagon wheels outside. The front door swings open.
STAE:
Hi there. Can I help you?
COURIEE:
(cheery Australian accent)
Yeah, I’m looking for a Betula Erfydsdottir?
BETULE:
Yup, That’s me.
COURIEE:
Hi, I’m Crane! Where do you want us to set up these tables?
BETULE:
Tables?
GUBBIE:
Tables?
COURIEE:
Yeah, for the festival?
STAE:
Tables?
BETULE:
We didn’t order any tables…
COURIEE:
Oh, no, yeah, we got an order in to deliver two tents, plus tables, signage, a portable stove and all the groceries.
STAE:
(looking out the door)
What the heck? Is this your wagon? Holy cow.
COURIEE:
Yeah! The rest of the crew should be here soon.
BETULE:
What crew? Who sent you?
GUBBIE:
How much is all this gonna cost us?
COURIEE:
Cost you? Nothing. This is already paid for. All sales go straight to you.
GUBBIE:
What’s the catch?
COURIEE:
No catch. It’s all taken care of. Oh, there’s a note for you. Here.
Betula opens the note.
BETULE:
“All the best for a successful Taste of Mud Street. Looking forward to working closely with you. Regards… Stuart.”
GUBBIE:
Yeah, I had a feeling.
STAE:
Sorry, Sutart? Who? Who?
COURIEE:
So, we’ve got five tables, so I’m thinking two on this side of the door, two on that side and one under the window for prep. We’re gonna be serving a stripped-down version of your existing menu: stew, mock pigeon pie, and two ales on tap. I’m just gonna head out and start setting up. Sound good?
STAE:
Look, this is great. This all looks amazing, thank you so much—
COURIEE:
Yeah, you bet!
He closes the front door behind him.
STAE:
Can we get back to the Stuart part? Who the heck is Stuart?
BETULE:
Just a guy we’ve been meeting with—I’ve been meeting with. He’s been passing me information about Duffin Braithwick. Like that big scandal in the paper last week about how he was using animate ink to alter ballots. That was a tip from Stuart.
STAE:
And now this “Stuart” is just suddenly sending us a ready-made booth for the street fair?
GUBBIE:
And a whole team to run it? Betula, what exactly did you agree to?
BETULE:
Nothing! I didn’t agree to anything! He didn’t tell me anything like this was happening.
GUBBIE:
This is all straight out of some kinda fairy tale. Someone waved a magic wand and kapoof, we got a feast to sell all the visitors at the fair.
BETULE:
I didn’t even know there was A Taste of Mud Street going on this weekend. None of us knew!
STAE:
But this Stuart guy did, clearly. And made this all appear overnight.
GUBBIE:
Like magic.
Wait a second. Stan, what was that plan you were warning us about? Some transmission line being built by Mysticorp?
STAE:
Yeah, transmission line, yeah. I mean, what does that have to do with any of this?
GUBBIE:
You said they’re running the lines through this neighbourhood?
STAE:
Yeah?
GUBBIE:
I bet you a whole wagonload of pigeon pies that they want to build something just this side of the bridge. Which is owned by Braithwick Shipping.
STAE:
Yeah, but what does that have to do with us suddenly having food tents?
BETULE:
The guy I met. Stuart. He’s with Mysticorp.
STAE:
He’s what?
Mysticorp Energy paid for all this?
BETULE:
Yeah!
GUBBIE:
Well, that’s what the signs say.
STAE:
The signs?! Wait—
(he looks out the door)
Oh no!
GUBBIE:
“Mysticorp Energy wishes you a very happy Taste of Mud Street!”
BETULE:
I mean, that’s pretty amazing.
STAE:
Amazing? No, no, no, we can’t do this!
BETULE:
Stan, they totally saved us! We would have had nothing this weekend. Everyone else on the block would have been making money hand over fist and we would have gotten nothing. Now we’ve got a whole team here to sell food for us.
STAE:
No no no. No! Tell them we’re giving it back.
BETULE:
The food’s already here. Do you want to waste it?
STAE:
We can not promote them. They’re the bad guys.
BETULE:
What’s the big deal? It’s not like people are really going to vote based on some stupid sign.
GUBBIE:
And it looks like they made you some shiny new campaign buttons too.
BETULE:
We’re not actually taking money from them.
STAE:
We might as well be! Look, I may be the dumbest guy in town and even I know that Mysticorp is gonna want you to do their bidding. They want your support building this transmission line once you win.
BETULE:
(laughs)
If we win. Gods help us if that actually happens.
STAE:
What do you mean? That’s the whole point. We’re trying to win.
BETULE:
Speak for yourself. I just signed on for the free stuff.
STAE:
How can you say that? Is this just a game to you? What happens on council affects everyone in this city. And here’s you guys, laughing about taking money from Mysticorp.
BETULE:
Well, what do you want me to do? Drop out of the race?
STAE:
No, no, no! That’s handing Braithwick another term. We have a chance to make a difference in this city, guys!
GUBBIE:
Kid, what difference are we really gonna make?
STAE:
Well, none, if you’re gonna be like that. Listen to you two! Don’t you care about anyone but yourselves?
GUBBIE:
Hey. Hey! I care about this place. I care about my regulars and my neighbourhood.
STAE:
Really? Doesn’t seem that way to me. You’re always complaining about the neighbours. And your regulars. Because no one is ever good enough for you.
GUBBIE:
Ouch.
BETULE:
Look, Mysticorp is trying to help us take down a corrupt councillor.
STAE:
That doesn’t make them saints.
BETULE:
Yeah? Well, Stan, it doesn’t make them evil.
GUBBIE:
You know what your problem is, Stan—you care too much.
STAE:
Yeah? Maybe I do. But who do you think should run this city? People who care or people who don’t?
GUBBIE:
You wanna please everybody, and for everybody to just get along, and that’s not reality.
STAE:
Maybe not, but we can try to make it reality. We can try to get along.
GUBBIE:
Some people are just wrong, Stan.
STAE:
Yeah.
And right now, I think that’s you.
And I can’t be part of this.
He walks to the door.
GUBBIE:
Suit yourself.
BETULE:
No, Stan, come on. We’re just serving food outside for a weekend.
STAE:
You’re not even serving the food.
Look, I can’t be here. I can’t be in the middle of all this. I’m gonna go work for someone who does care.
BETULE:
Stan…
Stan closes the door. A moment later, it opens again.
COURIEE:
Hey, is it okay if we store the casks of ale inside?
(awkward pause)
Bad time. I’ll come back.
He closes the door.
INT. BAR—NIGHE:
Music and celebration outside. Gubbin and Betula watch from inside.
BETULE:
I gotta hand it to them. It all worked.
GUBBIE:
The kids on our “street team” said they were up to four hundred crowns already.
BETULE:
Wow. It really was a hell of a party. And they’re back at it again tomorrow.
GUBBIE:
Yeah. You hand out a lot of campaign flyers?
BETULE:
Hundreds. Had a few people interested in booking events here.
GUBBIE:
Oh yeah?
BETULE:
I overheard a woman raving about the stew, and I’m pretty sure she was a food writer for the Gazette.
GUBBIE:
Well, her readers are in for a shock when they come and taste our regular food.
BETULE:
Where did all those people come from today?
GUBBIE:
With all their money.
BETULE:
Yeah.
I mean, I’m not complaining.
GUBBIE:
No, no, me neither.
Glum silence.
BETULE:
I hope Stan’s doing okay.
GUBBIE:
Yeah.
INT. CAFE—DA:
A busy cafe. The door opens with a jingle, and Stan walks up to where Betula is sitting.
STAE:
(polite)
Hello, Betula.
BETULE:
Stan! Hi. Uh, have a seat? Or I guess you order up there first.
STAE:
No, I’m good for now.
BETULE:
Yeah. Heh. Feel a little out of place here. But thanks for meeting me.
STAE:
Yeah.
BETULE:
So… congrats.
STAE:
Yeah. You too. You won, that’s…
BETULE:
I’m really glad Constance got in.
STAE:
Thanks.
BETULE:
Did you have a good party after the results came in?
STAE:
Oh yeah. Constance gave a really great speech. It was very moving.
BETULE:
Aw, that’s great. And you’re gonna be working at her office now, huh?
STAE:
Yup. I get my own desk, business cards… it’s pretty sweet.
BETULE:
Nice. Heh.
Look, I know we made some bad decisions in this campaign. You were right. We were flying high and didn’t realize what we were doing. I didn’t realize.
We made almost a thousand crowns over the weekend, but… I thought it should go to something more important. I want to donate it to… what’s the organization Constance runs? River Grand Grandmas?
STAE:
Grandmas for the Grand. Yeah, that’s it.
That’s a thoughtful gesture, but no. Thank you.
BETULE:
What? Think what you could do with that money!
STAE:
Money from Mysticorp.
BETULE:
It’s money from our weekend selling food at the Axe and Crown.
STAE:
Which was all run and managed by Mysticorp. They were handing out buttons. There were sponsorship signs all over your tent. This is Mysticorp money. Betula, we can’t take it.
BETULE:
But what am I supposed to do with it?
STAE:
Fix the floors, buy new bar stools—why are you asking me?
BETULE:
Stan. I’m out of my depth. I never thought I’d actually win.
STAE:
Seems like you’re better at this than you thought, huh?
BETULE:
Yeah. But… I’m lost.
STAE:
Betula, I cut you a lot of slack, you know? All this time, I’ve been looking the other way when people come to you to fence whatever thing they stole—
BETULE:
Stan! Shh! Geez.
STAE:
Actually, no, I’m not gonna “shh”.
Look, maybe underneath all the stealing and the lying and the sabotaging your competition, maybe underneath that there’s still a good troll with a heart of gold. Or maybe not. I honestly can’t tell any more.
But I want to believe that you can stand up for all those people who voted for you. And you’re not just gonna line your own pockets, or shill for a huge energy company.
BETULE:
I won’t. I never signed anything, I never promised them anything. I don’t have to do what they say.
STAE:
Yeah. I guess we’ll see.
BETULE:
I want to make this right.
STAE:
I want to believe you, Betula. I really—I honestly do. I don’t know if I can yet.
BETULE:
That’s fair.
STAE:
So.
I’m gonna see you at town hall.
BETULE:
Yeah, see you there.
STAE:
See you there.
Stan walks slowly out.

It’s Eli here, and we thought it was time to open up the vaults again and release a few of our favourite Patreon bonuses from the past little while.
This one’s an Axe and Crown special inspired by… okay, I mean you’ve heard podcasts, right? You might recognize the inspiration for this one. It’s called “A Dangerous Cocktail”.
Music sting.
THE BAE:
Stan tears open an envelope.
STAE:
Hey Gubbin, we should really go through the mail more often.
GUBBIE:
Yeah, like I need more bills.
STAE:
Well yeah, there are a lot of those. But every envelope holds a chance of something special.
Hey, look, a flyer!
GUBBIE:
Ooo! Not just mail, but junk mail! Excuse me while I contain my excitement.
STAE:
Actually, this sounds pretty cool. Pestle and Mix: A cocktail subscription service.
GUBBIE:
A what?
STAE:
Look at this! They send you a box of cocktail supplies every month.
GUBBIE:
Cocktails, schmocktails. This is a bar, not some cutesy little North Side night club.
STAE:
Hey, bars can serve cocktails. Hello? People like to try new things, you know—get out of their comfort zone and live a little?
GUBBIE:
Well, this here barkeep is quite comfortable in his comfort zone. That’s why it’s called a comfort zone, and he’s in it. Thank you very much.
STAE:
You know the Blue Pantaloons by the Palace? They have an artist on staff who will sketch your cocktail before you drink it.
GUBBIE:
Why would anyone want a picture of their drink?
STAE:
You share it with your friends, so they see how amazingly perfect your life is.
BETULE:
What are you two up to?
GUBBIE:
Starting to doubt humanity again…
STAE:
Betula, you talk to him.
BETULE:
About?
STAE:
Let’s put some cocktail drinks on the menu. Jazz things up a little bit.
GUBBIE:
No. What the hell is “jazz”? No. Just no.
STAE:
Fine. I’m sorry I brought it up. I’ll just throw this away.
He starts to crumple up the flyer.
BETULE:
No, no, let’s see that.
“Three new recipes every month from Farloria’s top bartenders.”
STAE:
They send you a box with all the ingredients. We just add the alcohol.
GUBBIE:
What’s wrong with just drinking the alcohol we already have?
STAE:
This is about the experience. A night out wearing your very best, laughing and jibing with your college buddies. As if the whole town was your oyster!
GUBBIE:
Yeah. The last thing we need is a bunch of entitled, loudmouth whelps running around my bar, puking on my floor because they can’t keep their oysters down.
STAE:
Come on, Gubbin. Here, look. Look at this one. Doesn’t that look tasty?
GUBBIE:
Ugh. I drink my alcohol like a real troll, thank you.
BETULE:
You know, maybe Stan’s on to something. Cocktail culture is big in Melluria, and now it’s starting to show up here. I hear there’s even a cocktail bar back in Trølsund.
GUBBIE:
Ugh. Now I really don’t need to go back.
BETULE:
I think it’s called De Appel Tvig.
STAE:
You see, Gubbin? We need to jump on this bandwagon before it sails!
GUBBIE:
I don’t know if you two have looked around lately, but this ain’t exactly a high-end Palace Street establishment. Who the hell do you think is gonna come here to the Axe and Crown for cocktails?
STAE:
No, listen! The down-and-out vibe is totally in. Slumming it, diving in, living life like a Mellurian artiste—starving, yet sophisticated.
GUBBIE:
Stop.
BETULE:
I’m not saying this is gonna work. But the city crowd would bring pretty fat wallets.
Silence.
GUBBIE:
Okay, I’m listening.
STAE:
So this Pestle and Mix service gives us the recipes. All we need are the cocktail glasses!
BETULE:
And maybe we could all take a bath and dress up a little?
STAE:
Yeah, all of us.
GUBBIE:
Why are you all looking at me?
(scoffs)
Can you picture me in a suit and tie?
STAE:
C’mon. What do you say, Gubbin?
GUBBIE:
Ugh. You guys are exhausting. All right, all right. How much is this cocktail box going to run us, anyway?
STAE:
Here.
GUBBIE:
WHAT?
(he snatches the flyer from Stan)
40 crowns! Are you insane? Your hoity-toity bourgeois clowns can just sip unadulterated ale out of big person glasses like the rest of us!
STAE:
But that’s not really—
BETULE:
Stan, how much do these cocktails go for? By the glass?
STAE:
I dunno, last time I was at the Blue Pantaloons, I think it was about eight crowns per drink?
GUBBIE:
Eight crowns.
STAE:
Maybe nine? I dunno. It’s a bit hazy. Those drinks go down pretty easy, ha ha.
Long pause.
GUBBIE:
Let’s get one thing straight. We’re not spending 40 crowns.
STAE:
The recipes are sort of important.
GUBBIE:
Then you two geniuses can get creative and come up with your own recipes.
STAE:
Woo hoo! Signature Axe and Crown cocktails!
GUBBIE:
Yeah, whatever. Just don’t kill my patrons, okay?
Music sting.
A FEW DAYS LATEE:
Stan enters carrying a box of cocktail glasses.
GUBBIE:
Hey Stan.
STAE:
Hey guys! Look! The new cocktail glasses are ready. I had them put axes on half and crowns on the other half.
He sets the box on the bar and opens it. Gubbin picks up a glass.
GUBBIE:
People drink out of these little things? You can’t even fit a single shot in here.
STAE:
Ah, let me educate you, my friend. The glasses are shaped to expose the liquid to the air so you get the full aromatic experience.
GUBBIE:
I feel like an idiot just holding it.
The glass in his hand shatters delicately.
STAE:
Gubbin!
GUBBIE:
I barely touched it!
Betula enters with groceries in a basket.
BETULE:
Ooo. Nice glasses.
STAE:
Aren’t they cool?
GUBBIE:
(grunts)
If they last the night. How are you two coming along with those recipes?
STAE:
We’re still experimenting a little, but…
Betula hoists the basket of goods behind the bar.
BETULE:
We’ve got a couple promising ones. Now move aside.
GUBBIE:
It’s my bar.
BETULE:
Not when I’m making the drinks, it isn’t. No. Go. Uncle. Sit. Sit at the bar and behave.
GUBBIE:
Fine.
He trudges around the bar and has a seat.
BETULE:
Now, this is a work in progress, but I think you’re gonna like it.
Betula pulls down a bottle from the top shelf and sets about mixing a drink.
GUBBIE:
Hey, that’s the good stuff!
BETULE:
Yup. Plus pomegranate juice and a quick shake… And just three sprigs of burning juniper.
GUBBIE:
What? I said no burning stuff!
BETULE:
Relax. It’s not literally burning, that’s just what the plant’s called. It’s a garnish.
GUBBIE:
Why anyone would doctor perfectly good spirits is beyond me.
STAE:
Look, it’s all about…
STAN AND BETULE:
…the experience.
BETULE:
Here. Just try it, Uncle.
I’m calling it a “Red Kraken”.
GUBBIE:
You’ve tainted perfectly good alcohol is what you’ve done.
He takes a noisy sip.
STAE:
And?
He downs the rest.
GUBBIE:
That is… not bad.
BETULE:
He says, after drinking it all in one go.
GUBBIE:
Okay, okay. It’s, uh, pretty tasty.
BETULE:
Right?
STAE:
Woo hoo! Okay, my turn! My turn!
He pushes his way behind the bar and gets to work.
STAE:
Okay, watch this. I just need this glass here… thank you… Let’s see, shot of gin.
BETULE:
Ow… wait. Stan! Stan, you are making a mess.
STAE:
I’m on a roll, let me work. Just gotta squeeze a bit of crangerine into there…
BETULE:
You’re standing on my foot. Is that an egg?
STAE:
Yup, sure, the egg goes in there, and then we shake-shake-shake-shake-shake, yeah, give it a good little shake, there we go, and…
Stan pours, and sets the shaker down triumphantly.
STAE:
Tada!
GUBBIE:
What is this?
STAE:
I call this a Moonshine Fizz.
The drink fizzes and goes on fizzing.
GUBBIE:
Is it supposed to be frothing all over my bar?
STAE:
Still perfecting the ratios.
GUBBIE:
Uh huh. Betula, would you care to…?
BETULE:
Nope. All you, Uncle.
GUBBIE:
(deep breath)
Okay. Here goes.
STAE:
Wait! Hold on! You can’t just drink it.
GUBBIE:
What am I supposed to do with it? Let it fizz all over me?
STAE:
(sighs)
You have to smell it first. Breathe in the aromas and textures by waving it into your nose and taking deep breaths like this. Just bring it up to—
(he tries and breaks into a coughing fit)
GUBBIE:
Or I could just drink it.
Gubbin downs it in one go.
STAE:
(still coughing)
…the… experience…
BETULE:
So?
GUBBIE:
It’s drinkable.
STAE:
…told you…
GUBBIE:
Why’s there gotta be egg in it, though?
STAE:
(coughing)
Gives it body.
GUBBIE:
Eh. Look. These taste fine. But we can do better.
BETULE:
Oh, you think so?
GUBBIE:
I do. Step aside.
BETULE:
(laughing)
All right. This I gotta see.
They trade places.
GUBBIE:
You’re getting stuck on all these expensive ingredients, eggs and crangerine and burning whatever-the-hells… You gotta think simpler. You gotta think profit margin.
He pours from two flasks at once into a glass.
BETULE:
My mouth is watering already.
GUBBIE:
All right, just a little bit of this… I’m gonna wave this over here, I’m gonna infuse it like this, I’m gonna put a little foam on it like this… dah dah da da… Ha ha!
I give you the newest Mud Street sensation! I call it “Dram Lake”.
He pushes the glass across the bar.
STAE:
(recovering)
I’m afraid.
BETULE:
Hit me.
Betula takes a sip. Then another.
GUBBIE:
How’s that?
BETULE:
It tastes like cheap whiskey that’s been mixed with… river water?
GUBBIE:
Ya got it in one. Simple. Honest. Clean!
STAE:
Is that safe?
GUBBIE:
That’s goblin moonshine. Anything it doesn’t kill deserves to live. And at six crowns a drink, we’re going to be able to buy a title and land.
BETULE:
Well then, your lordship… add in a garnish and I think you have something. Maybe some fish scales and mud on the rim?
GUBBIE:
Sure, if you really gotta make it fancy.
(clutches his stomach)
Ugh!
An ominous gurgling sound.
BETULE:
Okay, we can keep it “neat” if you prefer.
GUBBIE:
(groans)
STAE:
You’re looking a little bluer than normal there, Gub.
BETULE:
Uncle?
The gurgling turns into a bubbling roar.
GUBBIE:
(gasps and reaches out to support himself)
What… what did you put in those drinks? Hnnngh!
BETULE:
Oh no. He’s going to blow! Get down!
GUBBIE:
Oh no, the other end! AAAAArrgh!
INT. BAR—LATEE:
Dripping sounds.
Stan and Betula are cleaning up the bar and trying not to vomit.
STAE:
Oh gods… there’s more behind the bottles!
BETULE:
(groans)
STAE:
It wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t… for all the different colours… and the smell…
BETULE:
No, no, stop.
Oh, there’s some in the cash register. No. I have to take a break.
She sits down heavily.
STAE:
He’s gonna be okay, though, right?
BETULE:
Yeah. Alba said for him to just get lots of fluids and to stay in the bathroom until it’s done… you know, passing.
Gubbin staggers back in.
STAE:
Hey, Gubbin. Gubbin. Should you really be in here?
GUBBIE:
It’s my bar. I’ll damn well go where I please.
BETULE:
Yeah, you proved that point.
GUBBIE:
Har har har.
STAE:
Look, I’m so sorry, guys. This was all my idea. And I’m pretty sure that egg was off.
BETULE:
No, no, some trolls are allergic to burning juniper, it turns out. To say nothing of the river water.
GUBBIE:
We all had a part to play in this.
STAE:
Yeah.
I’m gonna put the glasses in the basement and we can just put this all behind us.
GUBBIE:
Why? We’re not giving up.
STAE:
What?
GUBBIE:
You wanna make money, we gotta take some risks.
STAE:
Yeah, but…
GUBBIE:
You learn from those risks and the mistakes and move forward.
STAE:
Really? You mean it?
GUBBIE:
Sure.
STAE:
‘Cause I have this amazing idea for a cocktail that you light on fire.
GUBBIE:
Stan…
STAE:
Look, look. Ye Olde Pointed Hatte has these “Spirits” nights where these two cool librarian ladies talk about mythology and mix all kinds of wild new drinks—including flaming ones. I just haven’t worked out how to put the flames out so people can drink it.
GUBBIE:
I said, no burning down my bar!
BETULE:
Maybe it would be a good idea if we just got a subscription from Pestle and Mix.
GUBBIE:
(sighs)
Ugh. Yeah, okay Fine. there should be 40 crowns in the till.
BETULE:
Uh-uh.
GUBBIE:
What?
BETULE:
About the till…
GUBBIE:
What about the till.
He looks.
GUBBIE:
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

STAN (ART CARLSON)
There are 40 towns in Melluria! I know that from my Geography class!

"Bonus Episode: The Axe & Crown S2 — Drubbin Drops In","ELE:
Hi everyone! It’s Eli here with a bonus scene from The Axe & Crown. This one was originally a Patreon bonus from Season 2, but we thought we’d share it with the world this week. It’s called “Drubbin Drops In”. Sean thought of the original idea, and then we shipped it over to Marisa, who actually wrote this episode. We laughed a lot during the recording of this episode, which you’ll hear after the credits. Enjoy.
Music sting.
INT. BAR—DA:
The door opens and heavy footsteps enter.
STAE:
Oh hey, Gubbin! Hey, I thought you were going for your mud bath.
There’s only a grunt in reply.
STAE:
But while you’re here, check this out! You know how I’m always looking for a little something extra to set us apart from the other brunch places? And here it is. You ready?
Look at these: hibiscus centerpieces! No, I know what you’re thinking. “Hibiscu-what? Sounds like something a centaur hacked up.” No no no. But here’s the kicker. (Hibiscuses? How do you pluralize that? Hibiscum? Hibisceus? Hibiscussesses? Hib… anyway.) They’re edible, see. That’s the point I’m getting to. So, there they are in the middle of the table, looking all nice and pretty, and then all of a sudden, boom! Our customers can just grab a flower to season their dishes whenever they like! Hibiscus pancakes, hibiscus omelettes, hibiscus for both dining and delighting. It’s a festival of hibiscus! It’s a hivestival! Huh? Huh? Pretty good, huh? Right? Gubbin?
DRUBBIE:
(very similar to Gubbin, but with a more hoity-toity accent)
Do I look like Gubbin to you?
STAE:
Well, I wasn’t gonna say, but you’re maybe a little more… craggy today? Rugged, rugged, that’s a better word. Craggy’s a bad word. But still the same old Gubbin. Why? Did you do something? Oh my gosh you did something and I didn’t notice. I’m such a bad friend. Is it your hair? Did you get a haircut, you sassy boy? Did you—wait, I know what it is, it’s the mudbath! It’s given you that certain special glow!
DRUBBIE:
I’m not Gubbin.
STAE:
That’s funny, Gub! “I’m not Gubbin.” Hey! “I’m not Stan. Whoa! You’re not Gubbin and I’m not Stan.”
(laughs, then stops)
Wait, wait. Are you having another existential crisis? Gub, what’s going on? Are you feeling all disconnected again? Like the universe is so vast that one big ol’ troll running a bar can’t possibly mean anything to anyone?
DRUBBIE:
I’m not Gubbin. I’m his brother.
STAE:
(really relishing the part of therapist)
You know what, I hear ya. I hear ya. I’m feeling what you’re giving me right now. I’m doing this. You’re lost in a bit of a troll spiral, I’ve read about these. Sometimes, we all feel like our own brother, don’t we? Like we have to step outside ourselves to really know ourselves.
DRUBBIE:
(sighs)
You are exasperating, small man. I am not Gubbin. Are you simple in the head?
STAE:
Yes… simple! Just like good old Mud street. That’s what you love about me!
DRUBBIE:
Is there anyone else here I can talk to?
STAE:
Hey, you can always talk to me. You know that.
(head on Drubbin’s chest)
Are you in there, Gub? It’s me, Stan. Now open up. Let ol’ Stanny in.
DRUBBIE:
Get your head off me.
GUBBIN! Hey Gubbin… are you in here someplace?
STAE:
Oh, he’s in there someplace. Don’t forget that You just have to look deep inside, Gub. Right here in the ol’ heartbox.
(tapping him on the chest)
You’re feeling a little rough there. Mud bath must have missed a little spot.
DRUBBIE:
Ugh, saints preserve me.
GUBBIN!!
Gubbin stomps down the stairs barefoot.
GUBBIE:
What the hell’s going on down here? I’m halfway to mudtopia and suddenly I hear all this screaming.
STAE:
Oh, Gubbin! Sorry, we didn’t mean to… wait a min… what… hold on, what’s… oh man!
DRUBBIE:
Finally, the penny drops!
GUBBIE:
Drubbin!
DRUBBIE:
Damn right it’s me.
They hug with much slapping of backs.
GUBBIE:
What in the craggy cliffs of Klomar are you doing here?!
STAE:
Wait—Drub… what… someone help me, please…
GUBBIE:
I see you’ve already met Stan.
DRUBBIE:
Yeah, the… the charity case?
GUBBIE:
Ha! Yeah, that’s him. The landlord here, believe it or not.
STAE:
Hey, now. Neither one of you is being nice to me.
DRUBBIE:
He thought I was YOU!
GUBBIE:
WHAT?!!
They both cackle uproariously.
STAE:
No, no! I thought it was a pretty understandable mistake.
GUBBIE:
We look completely different.
DRUBBIE:
Exactly!
GUBBIE:
I’m the bluey-grey one.
DRUBBIE:
And I’m the grey-blue one.
GUBBIE:
Different as night and day!
STAE:
You look exactly the same. I mean, aside from the mud and the towel.
Betula rushes out of the kitchen.
BETULE:
Hey Stan… did a seagull just fly through here?
DRUBBIE:
Anna Betula?
BETULE:
Onkel Drubbin! Vat yu is du heer?
DRUBBIE:
De same bak at yu.
STAE:
(whispering to Betula)
Quick… point to the one you think is Gubbin.
BETULE:
The one I think is Gubbin?
GUBBIE:
Stan can’t tell us apart.
BETULE:
Really? They’re like Gromskeigel and Shivsmargron. Completely different.
STAE:
Uh yes… Groms and Shivsmumble… those guys.
BETULE:
Mythical brothers who fought the Skolkraggar—never mind.
STAE:
Well, they definitely look like brothers… like twin brothers.
BETULE:
(scoffs)
Humans don’t have very good eyesight.
DRUBBIE:
Anna Betula! I did not expect to find you here too.
BETULE:
It’s a long story, but this is where I ended up. I’m helping run this place now, along with Gubbin and Stan.
DRUBBIE:
Stan is the little one?
BETULE:
Yes.
STAE:
Hi!
DRUBBIE:
This little silly one?
BETULE:
Uh-huh.
STAE:
Heh. Hi. Me. Silly. Little.
DRUBBIE:
Well, now I’ve seen everything.
GUBBIE:
Never mind the human kid. Grab a stool. What are you drinking?
DRUBBIE:
Ah?
A calculating silence as they stare at each other.
GUBBIE:
Holspirinki Vodka, eh?
DRUBBIE:
Yeah! You remember.
Gubbin fetches a bottle and a glass and pours.
GUBBIE:
Course I do. Gods. How long has it been?
DRUBBIE:
Too long.
(he drinks)
BETULE:
I remember Mama telling me you were off to Gnomensland just because no troll had ever been and you were gonna be the first!
DRUBBIE:
And I was, Anni-bet!
BETULE:
What’s it like there?
DRUBBIE:
Oh! A magical place… the Gnomish culture was a breath of fresh air after the cloistered coves of Dromsfjord.
BETULE:
Really? I heard gnomes are pretty suspicious.
DRUBBIE:
Well, it helps if you learn to speak their language.
GUBBIE:
So if you were living it up in far-off Gnomensland, what brings you to this dump?
DRUBBIE:
I am here… to seek my fortune!
GUBBIE:
I feel like I should repeat that question.
DRUBBIE:
I finally found something I excelled at.
GUBBIE:
So there is something you’re good at.
DRUBBIE:
(laughs)
Yes, after many years there, I learned the craft of their map-making.
STAE:
You know how to make a GPS?
GUBBIE:
(scoffs)
I never met a Gnome who’d give away his beer order, never mind the secrets of his ancient craft.
STAE:
Wow. What about clockwork?
DRUBBIE:
Oh, no, no, no, their clockwork is bonkers. No one can learn that.
STAE:
Aww.
DRUBBIE:
I learned to construct automated maps in the manner of the gnomes of ancient times. I come to you now with the finest Place Seekers this side of the Northern Mountains.
I’m not allowed to call it a Gnomish Place Seeker, for obvious reasons. But they’re just as accurate, and at a much more affordable price.
He brings out a bag and pulls out some pages.
BETULE:
Wow. I thought I’d seen some deluxe Place Seekers, but these are something else. Is that gold ink?
DRUBBIE:
Precisely. The blue is lapis lazuli. And that warm wash is crushed topaz.
GUBBIE:
You made these?
DRUBBIE:
Of course I did. I just told you.
GUBBIE:
You were always the idea guy, never the “pick up a tool and make something with your hands” kinda guy.
DRUBBIE:
Pshaw!
Tell me, Anna Betula, what’s the best place in town to sell my wares? Is there a good market where I can set up a stall?
BETULE:
I can definitely help you Uncle. I have some… special connections.
DRUBBIE:
Ho ho! Huzzah. That’s my niece.
A soft chiming sound. Paper rustles. Stan is peering at one of the Place Seekers.
STAE:
Hey Drubbin? Sorry… Drubbin? No, wait, you, you’re Drubbin, right?
GUBBIE:
Stan, I’m wearing a towel. How difficult is this? Come on.
STAE:
Right! Hey, Drubbin. What’s this little glowing mark on the bottom?
DRUBBIE:
What mark? Give me that.
He snatches the map from Stan.
BETULE:
I’ve never seen a GPS do that before.
DRUBBIE:
It must be some kind of reaction from the ink. Is there something strange about this building? Or the river?
STAE:
Could be the mud. I’ve always said Mud Street mud is special.
A precise knock at the door.
GUBBIE:
Oh great. This one of yours, Betula?
BETULE:
No, it’s the front door and that wasn’t my knock.
The knock again.
GUBBIE:
Go away! We’re closed!
DRUBBIE:
I recognize that knock.
STAE:
I’ll get it.
DRUBBIE:
Like… clockwork.
EXT. STREET—CONTINUOUE:
The knocking continues.
Stan opens the door.
STAE:
Oh my gosh, you are a gnome! Hey there!
KLINKAPLONKFELIE:
Well met, good sir. My Place Seeker tells me that this is the place I seek.
STAE:
Ooohhhh… you have a glowy thing too.
KLINE:
I have. It has brought me very far and very quickly. I wish to let a room in your fine tavern.
STAE:
Of course. You must have heard about our brunch!
KLINE:
I am in search of my Gnomish Place Seekers.
STAE:
There’s one in your hand.
KLINE:
No, I mean my other Place Seekers. My prized collection, crafted by the hands of my ancestors and passed along to me down through the ages.
STAE:
Oh, really? Are they as good as my friend Drubbin’s, though? ‘Cause his are pretty damn good.
KLINE:
Did you say… Drubbin?
Gubbin appears at the door.
GUBBIE:
All right, what’s going on out here?
KLINE:
YOU!
Something shoots out on a spring and zaps Gubbin repeatedly.
GUBBIE:
Aaaargggh!! What the hell was that?!! Ouch! Stop doing that.
KLINE:
I will stop when you give back what you have taken from me.
GUBBIE:
I didn’t take—ow! You angry little man!
KLINE:
I will listen to no more of your lies, Drubbin of Dromsfjord!
GUBBIE:
Drubbin…
KLINE:
A name that Gnomensland will not soon forget.
GUBBIE:
Will you people get it through your skulls? I’m not Drubbin. Ow! Oooh! Oooh!
Look, this is all a mistake. Drubbin! Where is that… Drubbin! Come here!
BETULE:
He’s gone. Ran out the back door.
GUBBIE:
What?!
BETULE:
And he took his fancy Place Seekers with him. Hey, who’s this garden ornament?
KLINE:
Drubbin of Dromsfjord, you will come with me and face the High Gnomish Tribunal.
GUBBIE:
I’m not Drubbin! Aaaaah!! Get him away! Get him away!
STAE:
Oh geez. He dropped the towel.
Now I’m never gonna be able to tell them apart.

OUTTAKE 1
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
I come to you now with the finest Palace Seekers this side of the Northern Mountains!
Laughter.
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
I’m not allowed to call it a—
(breaks character, laughs)
Would you stop laughing?
ART CARLSOE:
(laughing)
It’s a Place Seeker! It’s not a Palace Seeker! It can only f—-ing find palaces! It’s a Place Seeker!
MARISA KINE:
(giggling)
Oh my God, I can’t stop.
ART CARLSOE:
“We can only find palaces with these things. They have a very limited appeal. But still, if you need to find a palace, this thing’s gonna do the job for you.” “What about Place Seekers?” “I do not make those. There is no way in hell. That’s just too broad a spectrum. Palaces, this’ll get ya. I’m working on Fortress Seekers for next week.”
MARISA KINE:
Oh my God. I wish we were writing that.
“If you’re a princess, this is what you need!”
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Okay, here we go.
(back in character as Drubbin)
I mean, little girls would want a Palace Seeker. For gods’ sakes! I know my little girls would want one.
Laughter.
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
No, no, I learned—no, no, their clockwork is boinkers. No one can learn that.
The entire cast and crew in fits of helpless laughter.
HUGO JONEE:
Is it the accent?
ELE:
It’s a gestalt. It’s everything at once.
SEAE:
It’s a good time.
HUGO JONEE:
All right! Here we go! I’m coming in hot! Coming in hot!
More laughter.

(babbling)
OUTTAKE 4
STAN (ART CARLSON)
Wow. What about clockwork?
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
Oh no no, their clockwork is boinkers. No one can learn that!
Laughter.
ART CARLSOE:
Boinkers?
ELE:
(laughing)
I’m sorry.
MARISA KINE:
I know, we’re all a little losing it.
DRUBBIN (HUGO JONES)
No, no! Their clockwork is boink—
(laughs, breaks character)
That’s right. Now you’ve got me…
Sorry. I’m back!
(deep breath)
No, no, no! Their clockwork is boinkers. No one can learn that!
Laughter.
MARISA KINE:
Oh no, we’ve got the giggles.
ART CARLSOE:
All right! One more time. Here we go.
OUTTAKE 5
Laughter verging on exhaustion.
MARISA KINE:
Sorry…
SEAE:
I’m sorry, I want more Drubbin. We’re writing Drubbin into more scripts.
ART CARLSOE:
No, it’s “bjoinkers”. It’s been Swede-ified.
ELE:
I love that yeah, it’s B‑J-O…
ART CARLSOE:
Ahh. Nothing makes things funnier than a diphthong. Okay.
Gales of laughter.
MARISA KINE:
All right.
That was great.
SEAE:
Everyone breathe. Everyone circle breathe.
The cast take deep breaths.
Music sting.
