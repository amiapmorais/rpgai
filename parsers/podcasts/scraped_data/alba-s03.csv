"Double Feature: “Clairvoy-Can’t” and “Hiding Out”","EL:
So, next up: I wrote this one. It’s got some possible spoilers for our role-playing game spinoff The End of Time and Other Bothers… I say spoilers, but Magnus is involved, so who’s to say what’s true? This one is called “Hiding Out”.
Music sting.
EXT. FOREST—DA:
Whooshing and crashing noises. Magnus is practicing sword fighting with a stick.
MAGNU:
Ohoho! Nice try. You may be twice as big, but I’ve got speed and ingenuity on my side.
I know it’s not a fair fight, but hey, you were dumb enough to start it, so—
He swings and stabs.
MAGNU:
Ha! Didn’t see that coming, did you?
Of course not. Have you ever actually held a sword? Like a real sword?
You should probably think about a change in career. You know, like taking out the trash—oh wait, that’s my job. Ha ha!
A wild flurry of blows.
MAGNU:
Aww, did it hurt? Is the big bad giant scared? Why don’t you run along back to your—
HOLL:
Magnus!
Magnus whirls around, and falls over in a heap.
MAGNU:
Aaaa!
HOLL:
Magnus, what are you doing out here?
MAGNU:
I’m practicing! It’s the Mellurian Great-Heart sword technique.
HOLL:
More like Big-Mouth stick technique!
MAGNU:
Wow. Wow.
HOLL:
Sorry.
MAGNU:
Listen, trash talk is a vital part of throwing off your enemy’s game.
HOLL:
You’re supposed to be back at the House of Healing helping out the installers.
MAGNU:
They were getting along fine without me.
HOLL:
They need someone there for safety. You don’t even have to go up on the roof.
MAGNU:
Why can’t you do it?
HOLL:
I’m on reception! I’m supposed to be on reception, anyway—I shouldn’t have to come and track you down because you’re hiding out in the forest!
MAGNU:
Practicing. Practicing in the forest.
HOLL:
The Magic Support team only has a narrow window to install those lunar panels.
MAGNU:
Stupid panels. Why do we need them anyway?
HOLL:
You know why. It takes a lot of mystical energy to power all the new equipment.
MAGNU:
Which Minister Pearcey keeps dumping on us.
HOLL:
You’re just mad because you’re not allowed to use any of it.
MAGNU:
Well, it’s ridiculous! Why do we need to lock up all the fun—I mean the magic items? I can’t even use a fountain pen without having to check it out from that machine in the hall.
HOLL:
Yeah, like that’s such a burden.
MAGNU:
Hey, at least I can remember my password.
HOLL:
Everyone forgets their password.
MAGNU:
Four days in a row?
HOLL:
You need to get back to work, Magnus.
MAGNU:
We should just sign up with Mysticorp Energy. They’ll run a line straight to our front door, and do all the installation work themselves.
HOLL:
You know we can’t use them. They sell magic harvested straight from the loo lines. Using fricking! That’s so dangerous.
MAGNU:
It’s safer than the alternative!
HOLL:
What? Lunar energy is safe. And renewable, and dependable…
MAGNU:
Until it’s cloudy out.
HOLL:
The storage tanks can hold enough moonlight to last us weeks.
MAGNU:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just… I don’t trust lunar power.
HOLL:
What do you mean, “trust”? It’s the moon!
MAGNU:
But you know, moon magic is kinda dangerous, isn’t it?
HOLL:
How could it ever be dangerous? It’s exactly the same energy that makes moondrops work. And all the equipment has been blessed by priests of Celene herself.
MAGNU:
(shudders)
Ehhh. Yeah, that’s the problem.
HOLL:
What, the priests of Celene?
MAGNU:
Don’t—
(whispers)
Don’t say her name!
HOLL:
She’s the goddess of the moon.
MAGNU:
I’m aware! I just don’t trust her.
HOLL:
Magnus, you’re being ridiculous. The moon is true and sustaining, and Celene is—
MAGNU:
Shhh! Holly!
HOLL:
What? Of all the gods and goddesses, why would you be afraid of Celene?
MAGNU:
(flinches again)
She’s always trying to spread her influence across the land. I bet you these lunar panels are a trick. She can probably see out of them, or project herself through them or—
HOLL:
Magnus. Even if she could do all that, she’s a kind and gentle goddess.
MAGNU:
Have you met her?!
HOLL:
No. Have you?
MAGNU:
Yes. I have, actually.
HOLL:
Pffft. Yeah, right.
MAGNU:
It’s true!
HOLL:
When did you meet the goddess of the Moon?!
MAGNU:
It was a few years ago, when I was delivering mail for the monastery. I was out by—you know that temple out towards Paradox? The big tree that’s been blasted by lightning?
HOLL:
The Temple of the Oracle?
MAGNU:
Yeah. I was there when it got blasted by lightning.
HOLL:
(skeptical)
Really.
MAGNU:
Yes! There was this demon and a fairy and this other scary lady who turned into a bear—there were a lot of scary ladies, actually, and they were trying to summon a different goddess, like, an ancient evil one and that’s how the tree got exploded.
HOLL:
And then Celene just showed up.
MAGNU:
She did! She showed up in a chariot covered in all this blue fire, and she wanted the demon guy to dedicate the tree temple to her but he made her mad and she sent us all away and there was a giant monster and we fell off it and the fairy couldn’t fly and we nearly died like a hundred times but then she pulled us back to her castle and…
(he trails off)
HOLL:
And?
MAGNU:
Oh man. I just remembered. Cel—the moon goddess, she gave me a task to perform.
HOLL:
She gave YOU a task?
MAGNU:
But I forgot. I totally forgot about it until now. Oh no.
HOLL:
You. An ordinary human boy.
MAGNU:
She knew my name and everything! And she said… I was supposed to deliver a message to my future boss.
HOLL:
Who? Alba?
MAGNU:
She must have meant Alba. Oh geez, I’m so dead.
HOLL:
Magnus, when are you not “so dead”?
MAGNU:
(whimpers)
HOLL:
So what was the message?
MAGNU:
She said, tell your boss that the Goddess of the Moon says… hello.
Silence.
HOLL:
That’s it?
MAGNU:
I think that was it.
Silence.
HOLL:
So, are you coming back to help with these panels?
MAGNU:
Yeah, okay.
Music sting.

Music sting.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
Magnus roots around the pantry shelves.
MAGNU:
Where is it, where is it? Uuugh…
All right. If I was Alba, where would I hide it…? Hmm, I’m Alba—I am judgey, I am disapproving, I like bubbleberry cake and I need to hide it from Magnus. ‘No cake for you, Magnus, you haven’t earned it, you’re too lazy, so I’ll hide my ill-gotten booty where you’ll never look—I’ll hide it innnn… the mop bucket!’
Magnus grabs the wooden mop bucket. Nothing.
MAGNU:
Dammit!
HOLL:
What are you doing?
MAGNU:
Aaaaaargh! Holly! Don’t sneak up on people!
HOLL:
I wasn’t ‘sneaking’—fairies don’t sneak, Magnus. And we closed hours ago… What are you up to?
MAGNU:
I could ask you the same question!
Holly holds out a bag.
HOLL:
I’ve been collecting Scaly Wool-weed. The roots have to be harvested by night, and dried immediately.
MAGNU:
Oh, good. That’s… good. Carry on.
HOLL:
Wait! Hahaha! You’re looking for the cake, aren’t you? Alba said you wouldn’t be able to keep your hands off it.
MAGNU:
I am being unjustly denied my rights.
HOLL:
That bubbleberry cake was a present for Alba!
MAGNU:
Hey, it was for the whole House of Healing! I did my part! If I wasn’t holding the door closed when those bees attacked Jerome, we’d all have got stung!
HOLL:
That’s right—instead of just me, Alba and Jerome.
MAGNU:
You guys were goners anyway. It was damage limitation!
HOLL:
Well, you’ll never find the cake, Magnus, not in a million years. And even if you do, Alba told me she booby-trapped it, so how’s that for damage limitation!
MAGNU:
She was probably just saying that to scare you off. Hold on… do you know where it is?
(beat)
You do, don’t you! You’re folding your wings in that smug way…
HOLL:
As a matter of fact, I found it this afternoon.
MAGNU:
Yesss! Where is it, where is it?
HOLL:
I’m not telling.
MAGNU:
Holly, you gotta tell me. It’s inhumane! I’ll do the laundry for a week. Come on, what does it take to get you to snitch?
HOLL:
I’m not snitching! Fairies don’t ‘snitch’! We don’t do anything starting with ‘sn’, Magnus: no sneaking, no snitching, no… no snuffling!
MAGNU:
Ok, fine. You found it this afternoon. Great. And if you can do it, I can do it. All I have to do is retrace your movements…
HOLL:
Wait, no, that’s not what I—
Magnus starts pulling boxes around.
MAGNU:
Let’s see now… You changed all the dots above the ‘i’s on the jar labels into little hearts—adorable!—but I already looked there…
He climbs up on the counter.
MAGNU:
Then you cleaned the ceiling for the third time this week after one of your potions blew up for the third time this week. And… aha!
HOLL:
Magnus, be careful! It’s not—
MAGNU:
Aaaahaha! Thought I’d never go looking up here, did you?
HOLL:
Magnus, don’t touch that!
She flies up alongside Magnus. They struggle with a cake tin.
MAGNU:
Hey, get off me! Well well well, what have we here? A shiny blue cake tin.
HOLL:
No! It’s for Alba! Give it to me!
MAGNU:
Argh! Hey, I deserve cake!
He loses his footing and both tumble to the floor with a scream.
Squelch!
Silence.
MAGNU:
Booby trap, huh?
HOLL:
This is all your fault.
MAGNU:
(straining)
I can’t get my hand off the tin!
HOLL:
I know. Me neither.
MAGNU:
Holly, what is this stuff?
HOLL:
I don’t know… It smells like… Igneous Glue?
MAGNU:
Great. Punished for my success once again.
(struggles)
Oh man, we’re stuck good.
HOLL:
We’ve gotta go find Alba.
MAGNU:
I’m not going anywhere and you can’t make me!
HOLL:
You wanna bet? We’re stuck together now.
MAGNU:
Oh really? How about this: We’re going to get this glue off and pretend this never happened, or when Alba finds us with our hands stuck to this cake tin, I’m going to tell her that you were the one stealing it.
HOLL:
(scoffs)
What?! Alba will never believe you! You’ve done nothing but lie and scheme! Why would she believe you over me?
MAGNU:
Oh, you poor, poor fool. That’s not how blame works! Of course Alba won’t believe me!
(beat)
But there’s always doubt, isn’t there, Holly? There’s always a tiny sliver of doubt! There’s probably a million to one chance that I’m telling the truth. But I’ll keep insisting on it—for years and years, long after a normal person would have given up! I’ll be outraged and unshakeable, and pretty soon that little sliver of doubt’s going to grow. Alba’s gonna think, ‘No one would keep lying like this for so long,’ and that million to one chance will suddenly feel like a hundred to one. Then she’ll start noticing all the little inconsistencies, Holly, the little inconsistencies in your story as the years dim your memory—but my story will stay the same! And that hundred to one will start feeling like ten to one, then fifty-fifty! ‘You’d have to be crazy to lie for this long!’ she’ll think. ‘Maybe he really is telling the truth…’
HOLL:
Oh my gods, you’re a monster!
MAGNU:
I’m a fighter, Holly! I’ll never give in! So you better help me get this glue off, or one day, however long it takes, you’re gonna look as guilty as me!
HOLL:
Fine! Ugh, you’re the worst!
(sigh)
I heard somewhere that maybe you can dissolve Igneous Glue…
MAGNU:
See, that’s more like it!
HOLL:
OK, I’ve got it. Let’s get some Oil of Satyr’s Hoof—that always does the job for softening King Gunther’s foot calluses.
MAGNU:
Gross.
HOLL:
It’s around here somewhere…
They stumble to the pantry. Holly browses through jars, finding the Oil of Satyr’s Hoof. She’s trying to reach over and around Magnus.
MAGNU:
Aah, stop shoving me!
HOLL:
Well, you keep stepping on my toes!
MAGNU:
Only ’cause you’re in the way.
HOLL:
No, you’re in the way! Get your big feet out of here!
MAGNU:
Hey, my feet aren’t big, they’re… luxurious. Everyone says so.
HOLL:
What kind of luxury is that?
MAGNU:
Well at least I don’t snore!
HOLL:
What?! I do not snore! Fairies don’t snore! ‘S’ ‘N’, Magnus!
MAGNU:
Well, I hate to be the bearer of, y’know, truth, Holly, but you snore just like the rest of us lowly mortals.
HOLL:
But I—I… Is it at least a cute snore? Like a vole?
MAGNU:
Ha! More like a whole herd of voles falling down a well!
HOLL:
Oh no…!
MAGNU:
Remember when you were ‘testing’ that new Amborella tincture and fell asleep? And you woke up with a tea cosy over your head?
HOLL:
(gasp)
I knew that was you!
MAGNU:
What was I supposed to do? Your cute little snoring was gonna shatter the windows!
HOLL:
Ugggh! When I get free of you, I’m definitely telling Alba you stole her cake.
MAGNU:
We’ve been over this already, Holly, I am a master of manipulation!
HOLL:
Just hold still, this is going to soften the glue.
Holly uncorks the bottle and tips a little of the oil onto hers and Magnus’s hands.
Pause.
MAGNU:
Well?
HOLL:
It doesn’t—it doesn’t seem to be working…!
MAGNU:
What do you mean? The glue can’t be harder than the king’s calluses—he wears out his shoes from the inside!
HOLL:
Pull!
MAGNU:
Aaraaaargh!
HOLL:
Uggghh…
MAGNU:
Well, your way didn’t work. It’s time to try it my way.
HOLL:
Noooo, let’s just go to Alba!
MAGNU:
No! We’re fighters, Holly! Glue that cannot be dissolved must be melted!
He starts rummaging in a drawer.
HOLL:
Magnus, we are not getting anywhere near a fire with this!
MAGNU:
I’m not an idiot, Holly, I’m not going to light us on fire.
HOLL:
That’s what you said last time.
MAGNU:
We’ll just hold our hands close to the fire, so that the glue melts.
HOLL:
Igneous Glue is made with lava, Magnus, you can’t melt it!
MAGNU:
Not with that attitude.
HOLL:
Not with any attitude!
Front door and footsteps.
HOLL:
(gasp)
Oh no! She’s back!
MAGNU:
Everyone for themselves!
They try running in opposite directions, but their hands are still stuck and they fall to the floor.
MAGNU:
Get off me!
HOLL:
You get off me!
The door opens. Footsteps enter, and stop dead.
ALB:
Well?
MAGNU:
Holly did it!
HOLL:
(gasps)
Music sting.

Music sting.
INT. OPERA HOUS:
An orchestra tunes up, while the audience talks in sibilant whispers.
FIRST OPERA-GOE:
(male, a huge, snooty voice)
“A tour de force”, I’m told.
SECOND OPERA-GOE:
(female, equally huge and snooty)
Well, we shall see. I hope we can at least put that wretched ballet last season behind us.
FIRST OPERA-GOE:
Ugh! The music was bad enough, but the costumes!
SECOND OPERA-GOE:
Say no more.
FIRST OPERA-GOE:
Ugh. Have they replaced these seats? My tail is getting crushed.
Magnus and Holly work their way down the aisle, bumping into patrons as they approach.
MAGNU:
Excuse me.
HOLL:
Pardon me. Sorry.
MAGNU:
Coming through.
SECOND OPERA-GOE:
(with distaste)
The human section is up there.
HOLL:
I’m a fairy, I’ll have you know.
SECOND OPERA-GOE:
(scoffs)
Humanoid, then. Who can tell all you little things apart?
Holly flutters her wings angrily.
HOLL:
Look! Wings!
MAGNU:
Okay, maybe don’t antagonize everyone in our row, Holly.
They move on.
FIRST OPERA-GOE:
They’re just letting anyone in now.
SECOND OPERA-GOE:
Sad, isn’t it?
HOLL:
This looks like a good spot.
MAGNU:
All this fuss just to get a few dragon tears. I bet I could make a dragon cry without having to sit through an opera.
HOLL:
Who’s being antagonizing now?
MAGNU:
I’m not!
HOLL:
You always have to resort to violence.
MAGNU:
Who said anything about violence? Look, we just tell a couple dragons a sad story, collect their tears, and buzz off.
HOLL:
Dragons almost never cry.
MAGNU:
Well, this better be one sad freakin’ opera, then.
Holly opens her program.
HOLL:
Oh, dragon opera is where they let it all those feelings out! It’s always so big and tragic and passionate and emotional. And this show is supposed to be amazing.
(reads)
“Enziga Krammarbatch: an audacious new work of theatrical magic.” And we can say we saw it on opening night!
MAGNU:
You can say that. I’m gonna be over here sleeping.
HOLL:
Magnus, don’t you dare! You need to be ready with your pan.
MAGNU:
Alba got me up at four this morning and I’ve been riding on carts and wagons all day to get here. My bruises have bruises. All so I can come here to watch dragons stomp around and sing.
HOLL:
But how amazing is that? Dragons! Stomping around! Singing! It’s high culture!
The audience breaks into applause, then falls silent as the conductor taps a baton.
Then the music starts: gentle woodwinds and strings that quickly turn ominous as the soprano begins to belt out her first notes.
SINGE:
Ins Foia dei us griben Gretza / Hem zen Ziga af Fronenfifa…
MAGNU:
Oh man, four hours of this?
HOLL:
Okay, this is a little different than I was expecting.
SINGE:
Dal faunen eis Golfa dei / Com pritza, Fiantschi / Al Dimal dudal Tei
The music rises to fever pitch, with pummeling, atonal strings and brass. The audience begins to mutter and even boo.
SINGE:
La Chita dala Picalinga / Da fonen is—
The singer hits a particularly startling note—then screams suddenly as she’s hit with flying produce, and falls over.
The audience is in an uproar, tearing up the seats and throwing them.
MAGNU:
All right! This is more like it.
HOLL:
Magnus, run!
MAGNU:
Are you kidding? This right here is worth the trip.
The shouts turn to roars. Fire starts to crackle.
MAGNU:
Yeah! Burn it all down! Woo!
HOLL:
I’m getting out of here.
MAGNU:
Haha! You scared of a little dragon riot?
HOLL:
Yes, actually!
MAGNU:
Some people don’t know how to have a good time. Whoaaa! Hey! Put me down!
One of the dragons picks Magnus up and flings him across the theatre.
MAGNU:
High culture can kiss my aaaass!
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
Magnus and Holly stagger in, shell-shocked.
ALB:
Holly! Magnus!
MAGNU:
Dragon opera? Can go suck it.
HOLL:
I still can’t feel my wings.
ALB:
What happened?
HOLL:
It was a brand new opera. Very controversial.
MAGNU:
It sounded like a herd of elephants decided to start an orchestra-slash-wrestling league.
ALB:
That’s how it usually sounds.
HOLL:
No, no, I’ve heard dragon opera. This was… different. It was audacious and iconoclastic.
MAGNU:
You know, when those guys decide to have a riot, they don’t mess around.
HOLL:
Some people throw tomatoes. Dragons throw forty-pound pumpkins.
MAGNU:
And sides of beef.
HOLL:
And fairies.
MAGNU:
And humans.
ALB:
So, in other words, you didn’t get any tears at all.
MAGNU:
Nope, none. Except… for this huge damn bottle.
He sets the bottle on the counter.
ALB:
What? That’s… that’s nearly a pint.
HOLL:
You’re welcome!
ALB:
What’s really in this bottle?
HOLL:
Tears! Genuine dragon tears! See, after they burned down the amphitheatre…
ALB:
After they what?
MAGNU:
Yeah, I mean, you’d think dragons of all people would know how to make things fireproof.
HOLL:
We found the soprano and the theatre owner in the bar across the street, getting drunk and crying their eyes out. They were so heartbroken.
ALB:
Really!
MAGNU:
I want it on record that I had nothing to do with any of the property damage that occurred.
ALB:
All right. Good work.
HOLL:
Yay! Go team!
Holly and Magnus high-five.
HOLL:
Ow.
MAGNU:
Ow. I’m gonna go lie down now.
