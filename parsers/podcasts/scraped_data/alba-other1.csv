ANNOUNCER (ELI)
The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy roleplaying game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your Game Master is Sean Howard.
SEA:
Welcome to The End of Time and Other Bothers, Episode Zero. I’m here with Michael who plays Eggerton the flightless fairy. And I’m going to introduce him in a minute.
This podcast is an improvised fantasy roleplaing game that takes place in the world of Alba Salix. If you want to get right into the story, go ahead and jump to Episode 1 right now. This episode is just here to help explain some of the mechanics of the game system we’re using, and how we went about using improv to create the show.
But the show is story-first. So you really don’t have to listen to this; this is just here if you really want to know that stuff. And we’re happy to tell you.
So. I’m here with Michael Howie. He plays Eggerton the flightless fairy. And Michael Howie is also a professional journalist, so we thought what would be a fun way to get an Episode 0 out would be just to have Michael interview me and go through a series of questions so we can help explain some of the decisions we made together.
And there’s a full cast but they’re not here today. So it’s just me and Michael for Episode 0.
MICHAE:
And Eli.
SEA:
Yeah. And Eli in the background, recording.
MICHAE:
All right. So let’s get started. You use a lot of words in describing what we are doing. It’s not just a roleplaying game; it’s not just a fantasy podcast; and it’s not just improv.
SEA:
Right.
MICHAE:
So what is this world that we’re creating?
SEA:
I have no idea how to answer the first question.
Eli and I wanted to set out to create something a little different. There are a lot of great roleplaying-based podcasts out there. And I have to mention TAZ. The Adventure Zone is sort of what got me addicted to this idea. And then there’s been some amazing other shows that have launched, like Join the Party is another one that I really adore. All of these shows took that next step of editing and putting together a cohesive roleplay story.
And what we wanted to do is sort of to try and take another step forward. And whether we succeed or not is up for everyone’s interpretation. But the idea was to find a way to tell a story that could explore things like an A/B/C structure, still using a roleplay mechanism.
So it’s still four people sitting around a table playing a roleplaying game, but we’re introducing a couple things. The first is, we’re using improv to make offers back and forth. So it’s not just the GM telling you what’s happening, and it’s not just the players suddenly saying, this is what’s happening. We’re making offers back and forth, which is an improv technique.
The second thing we’re doing is we’re trying to play with an A/B and sometimes an A/B/C structure. So in audio drama, if you listen to Alba or any of our shows, you’ll hear that. You’ll hear there’s a main storyline, and then we’ll interweave a secondary or tertiary storyline. In a roleplaying game, it’s hard to do that because generally you’re just bringing the players and their characters through a storyline linearly together. And neither Eli nor I wanted to have scenes where it’s me the GM, the Game Master, talking to myself.
(silly voices speaking gibberish to each other)
“Hiya! Um muh vuh!” “How you doin’?” “Um doin’ fine!”
We didn’t want to do that. So it’s been a really interesting challenge to see how we do that third part. So that’s what we sat down to do. But at the end of the day we wanted a story that you could just listen to and enjoy and get really into the characters.
MIK:
All right. And as part of that, the mechanism, or the mechanics of the game are probably extra important in this way. And you guys settled on Dungeon World as the system for us to use as we build the world, as we play the game. What was the decision-making process that led you to Dungeon World?
SEA:
It was chaos.
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
We have… Stephen Smith is our roommate and our game consultant, because we’re up here recording in our third floor where we have 470 games. And so Stephen was sort of proposing different systems that he had, and walking through them with us, and trying to also research other system. I’m an old-time Advanced D&D 2 guy. And the first thing we did is we ran a test game in 5e, so we just did Dungeons & Dragons, the latest edition, and just got up to speed on those rules. And when we started to explore this idea of story-first, there were a lot of things in D&D that didn’t work for me. And other GMs out there have chosen to sort of change, sort of homeify… what’s it called when you—
MIK:
Homebrew.
SEA:
So the other GMs have, yeah, attempted to homebrew solutions to some of the problems in D&D. One of the biggest challenges in D&D is it’s just battle-based. And battle is very monotonous. We roll initiative. Whose turn is it? You hit, then another character hits, another character, then they all attack—and it’s not great story.
MIK:
Uh huh.
SEA:
So that was my first problem with D&D. And the second problem with D&D is that it’s about creating gods. Characters just keep going up in level, up in level, up in level and have more and more HP, until basically, you have to bring in dragons before it’ll be any kind of a challenge for them.
I wanted to find a system that would not be battle-based as its core mechanism, would fit better with the story and improv mechanism, and three, would get rid of that, and keep that element of danger.
One of the shows that I heard was The Infinite Bad. And they had homebrewed a system where nobody had a lot of HP—Hit Points, just to explain what that is. So it raised the danger stakes.
And then I listened to The Adventure Zone. They were in their off season, and he [Griffin McElroy] ran everyone through a Monster of the Week system, which is based on the Apocalypse system. A lot of words you don’t need to know, but… I loved it. I loved that system. I loved the idea.
Now, Monster of the Week is very specific to… you’re always just fighting monsters, and we wanted to move away from just fighting all the time. But that led me down the Apocalypse path and I started looking at different Apocalypse systems. Dungeon World is basically Dungeons & Dragons ported over to the Apocalypse system. And it’s super fun. And I loved it. So that’s the one we ended up choosing.
MIK:
And along the way, I was one of the many people who lived through your tirades about Perception checks.
SEA:
(groans)
MIK:
And we’re going to get into dice rolls a bit later, but this is fun for me to relive. It is Sean literally ranting about Perception rolls as we were just out and about. So we will get into that. I just had to remember that.
SEA:
Can you see the paper you’re referencing now, Michael? You’d better roll to check.
MIK:
(laughs)
Is that car coming towards us while we’re driving? I don’t know.
SEA:
(gasps)
Perception check! Yeah, I wanted to get rid of Perception checks.
MIK:
It got a little dangerous for all of us. Eli and I have had to form a support group, in fact.
Player sheets are an integral part of roleplaying games. Let’s talk about what player sheets are, and what the player sheets in Dungeon World generally look like, as they are all unique.
SEA:
I think with all the Apocalypse system games, the ones based on the Apocalypse system, the player sheet is far more of the game than most roleplaying games. In Dungeon World, the player sheets that every character has outline pretty much all of your abilities. And the idea is that as you level up, or you get better at something, you can select or get new “Moves”. Dungeon World is broken into moves, and all of those moves are listed on the individual player sheets. So you’ll hear sometimes we’ll reference a player sheet.
The thing I really liked about Dungeon World was, it’s not all defined and there’s a lot of people out there creating their own player sheets. So rather than changing the system, which we’ve done a little, you can just create a new player sheet.
So we have Blat, who’s a half-demon, and I basically found someone who had created a demon and used that as inspiration, and created a whole new player sheet specific to Blat and his abilities.
One of the things that we did with this campaign is we started everyone off as Level 0. So I created a version—which was, in hindsight, way more work than I needed to do—but I created a version of everyone’s player sheets that didn’t have a class. So, like, a job. So, to translate that: in D&D you’d have a fighter or a ranger or a paladin, and that defines what you can do. It’s the same thing in Dungeon World. But that would be called your class.
So nobody had a class and everyone had no level. But you had some innate moves that were specific to your race.
I love the fairy cake, so I’ll read it. And I think we read it in Episode 1 or 2.
MIK:
It comes up pretty quickly.
SEA:
It might be 3 now, based on what’s all come down.
So one of the moves that’s on Eggerton’s sheet is called Fairy Cakes. “When you feed someone one of your fairy cakes, sweets or nom-noms, roll +Wisdom.”
On a 10+ you heal them for a certain number of points. So you’re healing them on a 10+ roll. On a 7 to 9 roll—which is called a partial success, which we’ll explain in a minute—you heal them… but with a side effect. Like, drunken, blindness, tripping.
And that’s just an example of—and that’s it, that’s what’s written. And it’s a very simple move, but it’s a lot of fun in-game to play with that, that these fairy cakes are so powerful that they come with sometimes a side effect.
And so what I love about Dungeon World is that we’re able to use these player sheets and customize them to the world and the game.
MIK:
And the player sheets still do have the traditional RPG Strength, Wisdom, Charisma, Dexterity, Constitution…
SEA:
Yeah. Which we should explain, if somebody’s new and like, “Oh, what is all this stuff?” Strength is how strong you are, athletic. Intelligence is how smart you are, used by wizards to cast spells in Dungeons & Dragons. Dexterity is how dextrous you are, like an acrobatic move would be based on your Dexterity score. Wisdom, I like to think of it as street smarts. Constitution is how hardy you are—are you sickly or really hardy? And Charisma is your charisma. It’s how good you are at interacting with people or influencing people.
And so yeah, it has the same ones as D&D.
MIK:
The way the rolls work is, for me, the big difference between Dungeon World—well, there’s a lot of differences, but this is the one that as a game player, jumps out the most.
SEA:
Yeah.
MIK:
In Dungeons & Dragons, as we’ve already mentioned, you roll for pretty much everything you want to do. And you’ve got several different types of dice…
SEA:
But you’re almost always rolling the 20-sided die.
MIK:
Yeah. In Dungeon World, and in our game particularly, all of us have two 6‑sided dice in front of us, and there are some times when we have to roll, but it’s not the same as “Do you succeed or fail?”
I think the best way to do it then is to explain—we can use the fairy cakes as the example. How do we use these two dice to determine what happens?
SEA:
Yeah. So what I like about Dungeon World is it’s built for action first. So in the game you’re going to hear a scene where Eggerton, Michael, you bring out your fairy cakes and Marisa, who’s playing Darcy, says “Actually, I could use a fairy cake right now…”
MIK:
That’s a very good Marisa impression.
SEA:
Thank you. And she’s been having a hard time, and she accepts this fairy cake. Basically, the story came first and said, OK, someone’s going to eat a fairy cake. And then Michael would roll 2d6, because it’s his fairy move.
Sean rolls two dice.
SEA:
So he would roll the… I’ll do it again.
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
You’re laughing while I roll the dice!
MIK:
Because you keep rolling ones!
SEA:
I know. I’m rolling really bad, everyone.
He tries again.
SEA:
Michael would roll the dice, and because the roll says “+Wisdom”, he would add his Wisdom modifier. So he rolled 2d6. In this case I rolled a 7. I would add +1, because that’s what Eggerton’s modifier is for Wisdom. So I would have an 8.
And the way it works is very simple. 1 to 6 is a failure. 7 to 9 is a partial success. 10+ is absolute success. So in a roleplaying game, if I rolled an 8, Darcy would be healed, but she would have some kind of effect happen to her. She might be blind—I think that happens to somebody, I won’t say who, in Episode 2 or 3.
So what’s really fun about Dungeon World—and it’s difficult for me, and I’m struggling with it as a GM—is I’m used to playing games where there is success or failure, and then there’s super-success or super-failure, like a “critical fail”, a roll of 1. They’re funny because you did it so badly. Or 20 is a super-success.
In Dungeon World, there’s failure, which is basically, I make a hard move: something doesn’t go well. Maybe she has an allergic reaction to it. Who knows what happens?
A partial success is where something doesn’t go the way you want. But it is a success, so you have to allow the success to happen, then you have to introduce what the cost is. Sometimes that’s a choice you have to make, and I’m finding that it takes a while as a GM to get your head wrapped around that mixed-success idea because it’s new, it’s different, even though it sounds simple.
And then on a 10+, it’s like a super-success. Often you’ll hear in the game, I’ll say, “What happens?” because… the story continues. If you were trying to climb a wall, you not only climbed it, you vaulted over it, and whatever you want.
So that’s how the dice roll.
MIK:
A really interesting situation, is that in conflict situations, in battle, because battle still does exist, those who are familiar with Dungeons & Dragons know you first roll to try and hit, and if your roll is higher than the Armor Class of what you’re trying to hit, it’s successful.
SEA:
Yeah.
MIK:
And then you roll damage, and then either the DM/GM or the player says, “And this is what happens”. And that is really convoluted, and as you said earlier, that is one of the things that can really get monotonous in Dungeons & Dragons. How does it work in Dungeon World? Is it the same type of—try and hit, and then if you hit…?
SEA:
No. It’s all story-first. So the really cool thing is that in Dungeon World, the players and the GM, as we’re improvving, are in control of how zoomed-in or zoomed-out we are. In Dungeons & Dragons, if you’re following the rules and not homebrewing, you’re basically doing every six seconds of a battle. And everybody gets a turn every six seconds. Everyone. And if you have a lot of players, it can get really monotonous.
In Dungeon World, the players are able to just tell a story. And if the players want to do something that would put them in harm’s way, or that would call on one of the moves on their sheet, then we look at rolling.
But as you’re going to see as you listen, it’s not a lot of rolling. If a player says, “I want to see if can see where the enemy is, and I’m going to yell at someone, and I’m going to move over to this location,” and you’re not in harm’s way—then it just happens. The story continues. Everyone’s playing.
You’ll hear this in the game, that when a player attempts to do something where danger’s involved, that there’s a common roll called Defy Danger. So the story would happen first, and then we’ll roll really quickly, and then we’ll resolve in-story.
There’s also Hack & Slash, which is if you do go to fight… but unlike being “You hit, you hit, you hit,” you can do a complex move as a character. You can be like, “I wrench the goblin away from the catapult so I can reach the lever,” and that might be a Hack & Slash move.
So it’s a lot more fluid, and there’s less rolling, and there’s no initiative. It’s what makes sense in the story. Which I really like.
MIK:
Talking about the story and how we then resolve a situation leads into a note you have, which is: What is improvised? And I know this did come up with a beta listener. The improvisation of this show is mixed in with mechanics and with other elements. What parts actually are improvised?
SEA:
The entire show we are using improv tools that you won’t even hear or notice. So the roleplaying is how we move through the world, and we have moves, and that’s the mechanism by which we’re running this story.
Improv is how we’re running the story. So in the opening of Episode 1, I won’t give too much away here, but there’s a back-and-forth between myself and Blat around pneumatic tubes and an unsticking-stick that he came up with, and a high-pitched scream of the whistle, and… all of this back-and-forth we constructed that space, his job, what happens, all without stopping to go, “OK, wait, what happens next? Who’s doing what?” It was all by doing offers back and forth.
So there’s a scene that people—the beta listener—couldn’t believe was improvved, where Eggerton, your character—you had no idea where you were starting.
MIK:
No. Yeah.
SEA:
Right. So suddenly I say, “We cut. And the camera moves, and we move in on a building and we’re coming in on a boardroom…” Michael’s eyes were just getting wide when I was doing it live, when he realized, “Oh god, this is me!”
MIK:
Yep.
SEA:
And I set up a scene, and then there’s a moment where you had a slide, you had a bunch of slides prepared, ’cause that’s what you introduced. So you introduced, based on what I’d set up, that you were preparing slides for a presentation, and then I gave you what the title of that slide was, just in flow. I’m like, “Oh, and the title of the slide is X,” and… I did it better than that, but…
And you just went with it.
MIK:
Yeah.
SEA:
And that’s improv. So improv is making offers. And if we if we do it well, you don’t even realize that offers are being made. And it’s just a flow. And it’s not easy to do. And so a lot of work went into selecting the players around the table.
We wanted some people that were—well, I’ll be honest: I wanted one person that was an expert improvver. I wanted one person that had a really strong acting background, that was interested in improv. And I wanted another person that was a roleplaying geek. And I wanted this all to mix together, and I wanted us to have fun, and it seems to be working.
So everyone is improvving, though. Everyone is learning and improvving and making offers. There’s a really funny scene where I start blocking offers with a character, that’s what he does…
MIK:
(groans, laughs)
SEA:
And your character, Eggerton, sort of called me out in-game. It was really funny.
But yeah. The improvised, you won’t really notice it. It’s the fact that we are just going. We’re creating a story together. And we’re using a lot of “yes, and”. The idea of “yes, and” is you take an offer, even if it’s not what you expected, like the food scene…
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
And you go with it. Or “yes, but”: you take it and you turn it. Or a “no, but”. You can also do a “no, but” where you say no, and you’re turning the scene, but that’s more difficult to do. And there are offers being made by the players that are shaking the very foundations of the show.
So one of the things that we haven’t talked about is, we’re trying to put this show into the Alba Salix universe. Alba Salix is our first show, our first podcast, it’s a fairy-tale medical sitcom with a full cast. So that presented us with a few challenges on how to integrate into the world—a world where there’s already canon.
And so Eli and I have had to spend months creating maps, and backgdrounds and stories and coming up with how these four characters can have the freedom to improvise and tell a story without being told, “Oh, no, no, demons can’t do that” or “Fairies can’t do that in the Alba world”.
But the funny part is that yeah, some of the things that happen in Episode 1 made us have to rethink core, critical parts of the major arc that we’re working on—but in a cool way.
So it’s been fun. It’s been really fun. And the characters, you guys have no idea. You’re just trying to get through your scene and have fun.
MIK:
And the thing that jumps out at me in this, and I’ve mentioned this to a few people, is every time we have recorded so far, at some point—whether it’s involved in the actual game, or it is in a pause in between scenes—I have laughed so hard I have cried at least once. One time I think we delayed starting because Carter was making faces at me, and it took me ten minutes to settle down again.
SEA:
Yeah, it was good.
MIK:
The End Notes sessions are very interesting. And sometimes you end up taking a lot of flak, as people will hear. What are End Notes sessions, and what is the value of them to a listener and to us as the players and the Game Master?
SEA:
Well, first I have to give credit where credit is due. Join the Party has something called the Afterparty, and we are directly stealing from them. It’s a great concept. They do it really well—theirs is more structured. Right now ours is a little chaotic.
So our End Notes sessions are where people can sit back and go, “What the friggin’ you-know-what was that?” or “What were you thinking?” But we can also explore things like, “Did you expect us to go this direction?” Because part of my job as GM is to keep it moving and fluid. And sometimes I’m able to do that, and there’s some cases where around the table, people are like, “That wasn’t planned?” Because you guys just gave me something and I had to accept the offer.
So the idea of the End Notes is just to be able to have that conversation. So what I’ve started doing is giving out little green cards to everyone where everyone can write down questions, including Eli on the engineer table, to say, what are some questions we want to go over?
We’re going to put the first one or two End Notes up for everyone, but moving forward the End Notes will be for patrons. Supporters on Patreon will get access to the End Notes sessions where they can hear about Michael’s experience with the food…
MIK:
I actually wrote “WHAT THE F?” in big letters on my note.
SEA:
It’s a great scene.
MIK:
(laughs)
It’s gonna haunt me forever.
How can people learn more about the show? How can they get involved? What is the best way for them to both show support and stay up to date on what’s going on?
SEA:
Well, everyone can go to OtherBothers.com or AlbaSalix.com and you can access the show from there. So you can access The End of Time & Other Bothers.
Reviews are so, so important to us as story creators and podcasters. Sharing with a friend using the hashtag #OtherBothers is also a great way you can also get the word out about this show. And for those can afford to do so, you can support us with even a dollar a month at patreon.com/albasalix. There’s some great perks that are available, and that’s always really appreciated.
But any love that you can show for this show and get the word out there is super appreciated. And with time, as we get more and more episodes out, there’s going to be the opportunity to send questions in for the End Notes, and maybe even participate in different ways.
MIK:
Long live Boltius.
SEA:
Long live Boltius.
So thanks everyone for tuning in to Episode 0. We hope you enjoyed it, and we are super excited to hear what you think of the show. So please go ahead and listen to Episode 1, and be sure to drop us a note or a tweet, and let us know what you thought.

The sound of a river fades in, followed by slow footsteps along a dirt path.
ANANKA (VOICE-OVER)
And by the river comes walking a little man. He is a halfling. He is littler than most people in town. But he is not from this town. He is not from this world.
He has a job to do, this halfling man. He is a guide for travellers coming here from far, far away. It is very important duty.
But instead he has to talk to annoying squirrel.
The chimes fade out, replaced by birdsong.

The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy roleplaying game set in the world of Alba Salix.

Episode 1.

ANNOUNCER (ELI)
The End.
THE FILING ROO:
SEA:
It’s the year 32, or rather, the 32nd year since the Balgomarian revolution. The very revolution that restored the monarchy, enlightened the people and brought our most beloved Emperor Boltius to power.
It’s been over 12 centuries since the cantankerous but beloved Alba Salix walked these lands. Now Farloria is no more—not even a memory in this day and age. The Balgomarian Empire stretches over the continent and beyond. It all seems pretty far away from life here in Steadfast.
Steadfast is your home. It’s the capital and the greatest city in the world. It’s a twisting grid of monumental concrete and obsidian structures that reach up out of the smog. Sky high railway trams zip by while workers and vehicles move slowly through their day.
Now we’re going to begin with Blat.
The camera moves forward. It’s following one of the tram cars that zips past and the camera moves in on a nondescript large concrete building and comes to rest on a window with a worker behind a desk. But that’s not Blat. And the camera begins to go down faster and faster past window after window until it goes all the way through the ground, down deep into the earth and it starts following some pipes, winding through corridors and empty rooms until it finally pops into the room where Blat is usually working, only Blat is not to be found.
Clunky, mechanical music in the background.
CARTE:
Blat stumbles into the office, looking around to make sure no one can tell that he’s coming in late. He hangs his fedora up on the coat rack knocking it over because he’s too much of a nervous hurry, picks it up again, straightens it up, makes sure it looks nice; his horns now shimmering in the fluorescent light—because he is a half-demon.
He adjusts his tie and then, like he does every day, which he’s done every day for the last nine years, he starts alphabetizing files. Thick government files.
Long live Boltius.
SEA:
So your office—is it a cubicle? It’s an office?
CARTE:
It would be like a small room with a lot of shelves in it and perhaps Blat gets a single chair but no desk, per se. Just filing! Just non-stop filing.
SEA:
So basically, on the outside of the door to this room is an old brass plaque that says FILING CLERK. Your office is very near the furnace.
CARTE:
Yes, he is the only one that works there because being half demon he can withstand the heat. All the other previous file clerks complained and thus were moved to different departments. But not Blat. He finds it soothing.
SEA:
OK, so Blat is moving paperwork around when… Do we have phones, Eli? Do we have a name for those yet?
CARTE:
The Talk-O-Tron! The Talk-O-Tron or the Speechifyer. Pick one.
SEA:
Speechifyer. I’m writing this down. This is now canon.
Laughter.
SEA:
OK, so Blat: you work for Balgem. Balgem is one of the largest companies. There’s not very many. And Balgem produces all of the electronics, commercial electronics, of the world and they’re known for not always being the highest quality. So your Speechifyer on your desk starts twittering.
The Speechifyer rings.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hi-diddly-ho! Go for Blat!
SEAN (AS BOSS)
(over the phone, grouchy)
Blat, we seem to have a problem in that we don’t have the correct files from that accident case last week.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, no. I think I should’ve got that by now. Do you have a name for it?
SEAN (AS BOSS)
No, if I had the name then I would have the file.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Makes finding the file a bit more difficult. I’ll see if it’s this one.
(a pause while he checks)
Nope, it’s not this one. Maybe the one below it…
(another pause)
No. I just got these last night, so I don’t think these would be them.
SEAN (AS BOSS)
It’s from last week. It was the explosion.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The explosion. Oh, right. Now did I file that under E for Explosion or D for Devastating Explosion? Just give me a minute, please.
Soothing music plays over the phone line.
SEAN (AS BOSS)
No no… don’t—argh!
SEA:
Is there hold music?
(hums bossa nova bassline)
Dum dum dum dum…
CARTE:
(hums)
Ba dap bap ba dap bah…
SEAN (AS BOSS)
I can’t believe I’m on hold. I don’t have time for this.
The music stops as Blat picks up again.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Actually, it was in another section of E. It was under Extremely Devastating Explosion. But I have it here, yes. Boy, it’s a thick one!
SEAN (AS BOSS)
(sighs)
I need that right away. Send it up to floor D7-392.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
D… 7…
SEAN (AS BOSS)
3…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
3…
SEAN (AS BOSS)
…92.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
9…
SEAN (AS BOSS)
2.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…2.
SEAN (AS BOSS)
Yeah. I need that rushed.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll pneumatic tube it up, sir!
SEAN (AS BOSS)
Very well. Thank you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that’s a good day from Blat. Long Live Boltius!
SEA:
So basically your day goes around sort of like that. And, what does Blat do for lunch? Does Blat bring his lunch…?
CARTE:
Blat does bring his lunch. He just warms it up in his hands. He doesn’t need to use any of the lunchroom appliances for the food and he eats it in his chair in the file room because he noticed that going outside the building would actually take his entire lunch hour to get all the way up and then all the way around to the door and then outside again. So he just stays in the chair the entire time, trying not to get crumbs on his slacks.
SEA:
I just want to picture this. This is Blat sitting in a chair in the middle of a filing room with no desk.
CARTE:
No desk. No, you don’t need one. If you want to pile files up, that’s what the floor is for.
SEA:
So, I’d say that it’s a pretty busy day. The pneumatic tubes are firing non-stop, just all morning—sshunk! sshunk!—stacking up on each other as you have your lunch and plugging up the tube.
CARTE:
That’s what the broom beside the pneumatic tube is for. Sometimes you have to shove the stick up there just to unclog it. Get the files coming out again and sometimes papers fall out and they wind up in other files, but that’s what makes Blat’s job challenging.
SEA:
I was gonna say like that pressure would be building up as they stack up and that tube, right? So it’s after lunch, it’s around 1:00 and all the tubes are stacked up and there’s a strange sucking—it’s like this this high pitched sucking. It’s like the pressure is building and building and building up the tube, and you’re realizing you might need to get that unstuck.
A rising scream of wind through the blocked tubes.
CARTE:
We call that the Busy Day Whistle! It’s quite annoying. So that’s… got to get the poking stick. Yeah.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Come on. Get out! Get out! Stop the whining! Get out!
SEA:
So what are you doing? Tell me what you are doing.
CARTE:
I’m just taking the end of the broom and shoving it up the one problematic pneumatic tube. The problematic-matic tube!
MARIS:
Say that three times fast.
CARTE:
Problematic pneumatic tube! The problemati-tube. And papers are flying everywhere…
SEA:
OK, give me a Defy Danger roll. So you’ve got that stick way up there… Our first roll of the game.
CARTE:
Two dice—here we go! Ooo, that’s a 3.
SEA:
I’m going to have you help me with this one. So basically you’ve got the broom halfway up this tube. There’s this growing high pitched sound—which we’re probably going to hear when Eli adds it—and the broom gets jammed and you see the glass start to crack. What happens?
CARTE:
Well, Blat starts to get very nervous, because this is a really problematic pneumatic tube. He looks around for someone to help him, but he realizes he works alone. And so he’s trying to hold the pneumatic tube together with one hand while continuing to shove with his other hand that has the broom… and the squealing is just getting higher and higher and higher. And yeah, he isn’t quite sure what to do. He just keeps shoving with his problem-solvin’ stick.
SEA:
And that is when the explosion shakes the entire building as it just…
The whistle gives way to a huge explosion.
SEA:
The whole tube shatters, and all of the waiting canisters come pounding, literally ricocheting around the room like very large bullets, bouncing off cabinets, knocking them over, files flying through the air.
He rolls a die.
SEA:
And you’re gonna take 4 damage.
CARTE:
Oh my lord. This was quite the explosion.
SEA:
So basically the glass shattering out sends you flying and right into one of the filing cabinets—knocks it over, knocks the next one over… It’s like a domino effect in the room.
MARIS:
I think you could classify it as another Extremely Devastating Explosion.
CARTE:
I’ll have to file this… except the file room doesn’t exist anymore.
SEA:
And that’s when something very strange happens. So first of all you got the ringing in your ears. But all of a sudden you realize that there are no more sounds of pneumatics. So at first you think, OK, the tubes are broken, you broke everything. But then you realize that the furnace isn’t running. It takes a minute for it to sort of sink in… that there’s a silence you’ve never heard.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m… cold! This has never happened in all the time I’ve worked here.
CARTE:
So I open the door, if it’s still on its hinges—probably not.
SEA:
It’s half on. You shove the door. You sort of stumble out of the room with chaos behind you.
CARTE:
Looking around again. There’s no one… and I’ll go next door to the furnace room to see what’s happening in there.
SEA:
OK. Yeah, you’ve been in there many times like to warm up on a cold day. So you open the door to the furnace room… and there is no furnace in the room.
Blat’s voice echoes in the empty room.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, that’s changed since last time.
SEA:
It’s like a large empty room. It’s a massive room, right? And it’s just utterly empty.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I hope the Speechifyer is working. I feel like I need to report this to HR or something.
CARTE:
Is there a furnace number?
SEA:
(laughing)
I think the number was on the side of the furnace.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I know, I’ll call my boss! That’s it! He wanted to get the Devastating Explosion file and perhaps this will take precedence.
Laughter.
CARTE:
Can I find the phone in the room I used to work in?
SEA:
Right. So you’re right you’re back in the room. Yeah, you find the Speechifyer under a filing cabinet. It looks like it wasn’t damaged too badly.
CARTE:
That’s good. Government property.
SEA:
OK, so you’re going to try it?
CARTE:
Yeah.
The speechifyer’s ringback tone.
SEA:
It’s ringing. It’s twittering—like you hear the tick-tick-tick. But there’s no answer.
CARTE:
So. My manager isn’t picking up, my department’s been utterly devastated… and the furnace is missing.
I think this might be a professional development day. Just… call this Wednesday a writeoff, and I’ll see you at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
I guess I’m gonna to have to… go upstairs.
SEA:
So you gather up what’s left of your lunch box.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, there’s a file in it. Well, there’s part of a file in it. Oh! This was part of the Extremely Devastating Explosion file that my boss wanted… Save that for later.
SEA:
Your fedora is still there, untouched.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, thank heavens! Long live Boltius!
SEA:
In all the devastation it’s still there.
CARTE:
So I put on my hat… and start trudging upwards.
SEA:
As you walk out, the doors fall off behind you and hit the corridor.
CARTE:
That’s janitorial. I’m not going to worry about that. That’s not my area.
SEA:
And you make your way through your long route that you have to go through. It’s pretty normal that you don’t see anyone. And you come up onto the street out of your little side janitorial door… and it takes a moment. The first thing that hits you is: it smells different.
CARTE:
Sulfur? He said hopefully?
SEA:
Yeah, there might be a bit of sulfur…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Mmmm! Like mother’s milk.
SEA:
(laughing)
Yeah. So there’s a sulfur smell to the air. And then it hits you that you don’t hear anything again. It’s like… insanely quiet.
CARTE:
Not even the monorail?
SEA:
No monorail. No Centurions stomping around—just silence.
CARTE:
This is more than just a file-related incident.
SEA:
I have to ask, what would you… What would you organize a file-related incident under?
CARTE:
Well, it’s all just F. F is the most popular letter in the department. Because most things get filed under F for “this should be filed under a file”, or… like, X is never used, Q—very unpopular. F—that’s three filing cabinets right there. But he could always find it, because he was the only one working that department. He knew what was what.
I think Blat’s going to have to re-enter the building and perhaps talk to someone in security or something. Maybe someone’s got a working Speechifyer that we can contact somebody in the outside world to see what’s going on.
SEA:
So cut to Blat standing at the big front security entrance. And there is nothing. There are no people at security. There are no people going up and down the Moveators. (Gotta write that down.) There are no people coming in and outside the front doors.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no… Copernicus should be on duty. He’s the head of security. He should be at his little desk out front here.
(sadly)
Oh Copernicus, what’s happened?
SEA:
Yeah, there’s nothing.
CARTE:
He’s going to walk around, get towards the the Moveators. See if I can call one of those up.
SEA:
It does. It comes down with a ding.
Doors slide open with a squeak, and elevator music plays in the background.
CARTE:
Oh, very good. So I’ll get into the Moveator and I think I know what’s happening. What I need to do. So I just hit every button going up, like a Christmas tree. 2, 3, 4, right up to 112.
SEA:
Yup.
CARTE:
And I just get off at 2 to see, if I poke my head out whether there’s anybody doing anything on any floor.
SEA:
So on 2, your hope gets raised for a second, because you see a bag that had been set down or dropped, but then you realize there’s not a sound. You don’t see anyone.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(softly)
Bag, do you know anything?
Silence.
CARTE:
I take the bag.
Laughter.
SEA:
OK, so inside the bag you actually see it’s an executive’s lunch. Someone had been sent to get it. So is not like an Impescor thing. This is like, real food.
CARTE:
I get back in the elevator, heat the bag up with my hands and I’ll just start eating as I poke my head out on each floor… On 3…
SEA:
So I’m picturing like flame coming up from the bag, sort of, as the embers of the bag are burning away as the food heats up.
CARTE:
You don’t need the paper anymore so that’s fine.
SEA:
OK. So you’re going up floor by floor… Ding! Ding! There is nobody in this entire building.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello? Long live Boltius?
SEA:
You hit the executive suite floor.
CARTE:
Oh… someone’s going to know their lunch is missing. I’d best finish this sandwich up before I get off on this floor. If anyone asks about their lunch I’m going to have to feign ignorance.
SEA:
OK, so you’re shoving the rest of it in your mouth.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(undignified eating sounds then, muffled:)
Hello?
SEA:
The doors open and you see another security station. And you see machines that you have to walk through, right, to make sure you don’t have any weapons or anything… but you don’t see any guards. You don’t see anything.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(gulping his stolen lunch)
Hello…? Sirs…? Corporate executive sirs?
CARTE:
So I’ll pass through the safety machines. See if I can find…
SEA:
OK. The machine’s like… beep-beep-beep-beep-beep as you go through.
The security scanner beeps.
CARTE:
Does it detect that I have an illicit sandwich in my stomach?
Laughter.
SEA:
I don’t know. You’re not sure. It might have. It might have detected executive sandwich.
CARTE:
I’m gonna have to risk it then. I’ll… I’ll keep walking through, see if I can find anyone in one of the main offices in the back.
SEA:
So we cut to… You’re standing in what must be a VP suite. The view… There is no wall. It’s all window, like all the way up, on a slant all the way to the ceiling and you can see everything. But there are no trams. There’s no movement down on the streets. The place is empty and that’s when you hear…
The security scanner beeps again.
CARTE:
I spin around to see if maybe somebody else has come in through the safety machine.
SEA:
You can’t see the safety machine from where you are. You’re in the executive office.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Maybe… this makes me the head of the building now?
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My first order of business will be to get a new furnace.
SEA:
It is getting a little chilly.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’d ask someone to do that but there isn’t anyone here.
SEA:
You hear footsteps approaching. But they’re like… clopping.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhhh… someone’s going to ask me about that file I didn’t bring. Or maybe the lunch—the lunch or the file. It’s one of the two.
CARTE:
So I spin around and I don’t want them to catch me, here in the executive suite in which I should not be. So I’ll go out into the hall and see if I can meet the clopping footsteps.
SEA:
OK. So you step out, and you see, heading down the hall towards you, what looks like a minotaur. You’ve heard of minotaurs. You’ve probably done filings of their claims.
Wearing like, faded blue coveralls and a duster jacket flowing, and what looks like some weird hat. For those listening, it’s a ten-gallon cowboy hat. But you’re not quite sure you’ve ever seen anything like that.
He’s got a beard that’s sort of flecked with white, and he stops when he sees you. And… he lifts something up with his hand, and it’s hard to even explain what it is. There’s like a cable, and it’s bent. And it has a long part that he’s holding and he sort of points it in your direction and says,
SEAN (AS MINOTAUR)
(awkwardly)
Oh! Citizen. Hail Boltius!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah yes. Long live Boltius! Uh… fair warning: I am not a executive or division head of any sort. I work… a few floors below. I’ve just come up to see what’s going on—
SEA:
He pulls the trigger and a dart—sslpp!—slaps right into your chest. It just buries itself, this dart.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…Ow! I don’t see how this is helpful.
SEAN (AS MINOTAUR)
I just need to ask. Did I say that right? “Citizen… Hail Boltius?”
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That part was correct. We don’t usually shoot bolts at one another afterwards… it’s more of our version of “hello”.
SEAN (AS MINOTAUR)
Mm hmm. You should feel that acting pretty quickly. Don’t panic. You’re just going to feel a little sleepy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…I think perhaps you have something to do with this. And you’re not—oh, I’m starting to black out.
He hits the ground.
SEA:
And cut!
THE PRESENTATIO:
SEA:
So we’re going to cut to one of the nicer buildings. And it is actually one of the buildings where the Committee of State runs all its operations out of.
And we’re going to start somewhere in the middle. We’re going to come into a boardroom and we’re going to see Eggerton, a flightless fairy, who is preparing for a very big presentation on the last explosion fiasco from a week ago.
So tell me what we see. Who do we see? What are you doing in this room? So, it’s a boardroom and you’re getting ready for this presentation. People haven’t come in yet. You’ve got like 10 minutes to set it up.
MIK:
Eggerton is shuffling papers and opening a folio case and pulling out large printed charts. They’re very nicely done, lots of colours, putting them up on easels against the walls, humming to himself a bit as he does it.
SEA:
And tell me what does Eggerton…? Help me understand how tall, what he looks like…
MIK:
Eggerton is a somewhat typical fairy. He’s a little under five feet tall. He’s a little tubby, but you know, when you eat all those carbs and sugars that’s bound to happen.
He’s wearing a nice suit, but it looks a little off and when you look closely you realize that the pants are slightly different than the suit jacket, and as you look down even further you’ll notice that he’s wearing two distinctly different coloured socks: one blue and one green. And, you know, just typical nicely clean shoes.
He’s in his 30s. He’s got wispy hair that’s slicked back, it’s dark in colour; rosy red cheeks and big round eyes that are green.
And he is sorting out all of these things, and then seems like he remembers something, walks back to the middle of the table and starts spreading out the snacks. He’s got various types of cupcakes, cookies with swirls in them…
SEA:
Oooo. Real food!
MIK:
Well yes, he is a fairy after all. These are important aspects of any meeting.
SEA:
Are these fairy snacks?
MIK:
These are fairy snacks.
SEA:
OK! So you’re spreading out the fairy snacks.
MIK:
Spreading out the fairy snacks. Counting the chairs to make sure there’s enough for everybody. It’s an important presentation and he needs to be able to explain to the rest of Balgomar what the explosion was and that everyone should remain calm.
SEA:
K. There’s a knock at the door, that’s open. And you see your nemesis. You guys started at the same time and she’s sort of glued herself to your boss and sort of gotten the promotions and she’s, like,
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Eggerton… Sorry, Karen said, first you need to be ready in eight minutes, which I’m sure you are. I’m sure you’re on top of it. But Karen wanted you to know—oh, she told me last night. I totally forgot to tell you: actually, we need to spin this whole thing, that this was… this actually did not happen, and come up with some great reason why it’s a celebration.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s a celebration now?
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Yes. So just…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The large explosion at the center of Steadfast was a celebration.
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I have charts on how the wind will expel any potential harmful chemicals away from Steadfast, though.
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Yeah, fascinating, fascinating. I’m sure you have this in hand. I look forward to seeing your presentation.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s OK, everything’s OK. I’m OK. This is OK. It’s good. We’re good. OK.
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Good, I’ll tell Karen you’re all set.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I had eight minutes, I thought.
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Oh yes yes. You do.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. So you go talk to Karen. I am going to rearrange these fairy snacks that I brought in from home. And I’m not going to eat any of them. I am not stressed out at all. I will not resolve it with eating fairy snacks…
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
(interrupting)
This has been lovely, Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What celebration are we celebrating?
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Well, that’s your presentation.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s my presentation, right. Right. Right. And today’s… it’s Tuesday.
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s Tuesday. OK. No, that’s good.
SEAN (AS NEMESIS)
I have to go…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. Oh it’s ok… Yeah, go, go. I’m good. I’m good. I got it.
SEAN (AS NEMISIS)
Good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Good good.
SEA:
She scurries away.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh geez.
It’s OK though. I know because it’s Tuesday and Tuesdays are always good days for me. I like Tuesday. I found that microcredit on the ground last Tuesday so this Tuesday’s gotta be good. It’s OK. It’s OK. I’ll get it. I’ll get it. Good good good.
MIK:
OK, so the fairy snacks are looking really good. I’m pretty sure Eggerton has already, as he was sort of mumbling to himself, grabbed two of the little things and started shoving them in his mouth, crumbs sort of falling down, getting caught on this suit jacket.
SEA:
K, you look up the clock. You realize it’s five minutes before the meeting. And you’re staring at your big slide with the explosion.
And what’s your tagline? “The Smoke Will Clear”?
MIK:
The smoke always clears.
SEA:
Yeah, the smoke always clears. So you’re staring at that. And you’ve got five minutes. You hear people in the corridor starting to work their way towards the meeting room.
MIK:
I look around and try and find a marker. Are there are a lot of markers? It’s an office space, of course there’s a lot of markers.
So I go and I grab a marker. And I walk over to the sign and I put one hand under my chin, and tuck my other arm under it and look up at the big slide and think…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hmm… I’ve got it!
MIK:
And he walks up and where it says “The Smoke Will Clear”… he puts an exclamation point at the very end.
Laughter.
MIK:
And steps back, smiles, reaches over and grabs a fairy cake which he stuffs in his mouth and starts to eat as he looks up at it and goes,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right!
MIK:
And he’s ready now.
SEA:
OK, so people are starting to file in. You see your nemesis come in and sort out look at your board and sort of smirk a little and sit down, and everyone’s starting to sit down.
It’s the usual yes men, yes women, yes people. And a minute goes by, everyone’s just sort of sitting there. Nobody’s touching the fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Everybody have a fairy cake! I brought them in from home. I made them myself.
SEAN (AS CO-WORKER)
Oh, thanks. I just ate but, uh…
SEA:
And so everyone’s staring at this plate of half-eaten fairy cakes with crumbs.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They’re very tasty. I had to… to make sure they were very tasty, though, for all of you.
SEAN (AS CO-WORKER)
Oh yes. Yes. Good good good.
SEA:
OK, so Karen comes walking in. She’s like,
SEAN (AS KAREN)
So sorry to keep you waiting. I hope you didn’t wait. OK, well, let’s begin…
SEA:
And she sits down. She goes,
SEAN (AS KAREN)
Eggerton, I’m very excited to see what you’ve come up with to take this tragic event and make it a celebration for the people.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes! A celebration. That is exactly what I had planned on doing… and I have done that. So let’s get started with the presentation. It’s good. It’s good! Uh… could someone pass me one of the cakes, please. OK, thank you. Thank you for that.
(he resumes talking, with his mouth full)
SEAN (AS KAREN)
We can’t understand you, Eggerton. Can you do that last part again, please?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes yes. So, we need to say that this Extremely Devastating Explosion was in fact a good thing.
SEAN (AS KAREN)
Well, yes. So I thought I established that. So yes, so if you could go from there, Eggerton, and just sort of… yes, go on.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s good, it’s good. So what we need to do is spin the idea into something good.
SEA:
Everyone’s like,
ALL (AS CO-WORKERS)
Oh yes, yes. Spin. Spin. Spin is good, right?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So what I thought we could do is say that this Extremely Devastating Explosion was in fact a celebration from the previous Extremely Devastating Explosion, and that the smoke always clears. See, it cleared! So we’re all good and we were just having fun, because we all like to have fun! And the other thing I thought we could do then is put…
SEAN (AS KAREN)
So, wait, wait wait wait wait. Now this is….
SEA:
And you see your nemesis sort of smirking and you see Karen go,
SEAN (AS KAREN)
Wait, you said we’re going to use the name of the explosion in the celebration?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, that is what I said.
SEAN (AS KAREN)
Eggerton! I think that’s brilliant.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, thank you very much, Karen.
SEAN (AS KAREN)
Please can you… can you go to the next slide? If you could just show me what’s next. I’m very intrigued.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The next slide. Right right. The slides are all… they’re all good.
SEA:
You know the next side is all the dead bodies.
MIK:
So I… I pull down the slide and look up at it and listen to the gasps around the table.
CARTER (AS CO-WORKER)
So many dead!
MARISA (AS CO-WORKER)
I think that’s my cousin!
SEAN (AS CO-WORKER)
How is he going to spin this?
An uncomfortable pause.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So… Flashmob!
SEA:
And you hear a pop. You just hear a pop sound, like your ears pop—like a pressure change.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That was weird.
So we got everyone together, and we got on the Speechifyer, you know, the night before the celebration of the Extremely Dangerous Explosion or, excuse me, Devastating Explosion. And we told them,
“Hey everybody, here’s a fun idea. Let’s re-enact the first one and then after that we all jump up and go ‘Hooray, we’re alive!’ And we took this picture to show, for you know, prosperity what it would look like before that happened. That’s going to be really good because we’ll get the students out. Maybe we’ll bring up some of the people who are working in the basement, they don’t see a lot of the sun.
SEA:
You start to get a feeling that nobody’s listening. But your back is still to them, right? You’re staring at this slide as you come up with all this.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So I think, you know… we can all get behind this, right?
MIK:
And I do a little positive arm motion and say,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…Right?
SEA:
Do you turn around?
MIK:
And I turn around.
SEA:
The room is empty.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…I didn’t think it was that bad.
SEA:
Yeah, there’s nobody in the room.
MIK:
There’s nobody in the room. Nobody at all.
SEA:
No.
MIK:
Are the fairy cakes still on the table?
SEA:
Yes.
MIK:
I walk over and pick up one of the fairy cakes, a pink one that had only one small bite out of the side of it, and start nibbling on it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I knew Karen was a little, you know, unhappy with some of the things I had done but I didn’t think they’d all run away.
SEA:
Now you were facing the slide. So if they were to have walked out they would have walked past you. You thought you were pretty excited… but were you that excited to not see them?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I do get pretty excited from time to time and when I get wrapped up in an idea that idea just starts going and I don’t really know how to stop those ideas from going and it’s sometimes good though. I think it really helps me get new ideas and that’s what I like to do when I’m making the fairy cakes, I’m trying different shapes and different colours. So I don’t know that I’d necessarily see anything passing me by. But at the same time you know I was thinking really really hard and that could take away from it too. But you know Karen, she wears those shoes and they clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop when she walks in, so I don’t really know…
SEA:
Cut to 10 minutes later… Keep going.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And I’m really just trying to figure out you know, should I be doing this job or should I be trying to do something different? I think I can probably, you know, make people happy. And no one ever really seems…
SEA:
Cloppity, cloppity, cloppity, cloppity.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Well, this one’s gonna be easier.
SEA:
You feel this shhhunk!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What was that? It smells kind of funny.
(slurring)
Whaaa…
SEA:
And you hit the floor. And the minotaur puts you in a bag and puts a device on you, and just turns and walks away out of the room.
And we leave the bagged flightless fairy in the boardroom with food in his mouth inside a bag.
THE MUSEU:
A majestic orchestral version of the theme music.
SEA:
We cut to high above Steadfast.
And the camera is centered on the Plaza of the Empire. And in the center of this plaza is a giant monument, and we are moving towards it. And the monument is of Emperor Boltius standing on a sphere—a globe, the Earth. One hand is raised to the heavens, and the other is reaching out as if to the people.
We fly past this monument and we go past vendors, and Centurion soldiers, and trams zipping through the air. And we start to follow a group of people that are moving forward as if to enter the People’s Museum of Culture and Prosperity.
And the camera centers on one of these people—the back of a woman’s head. A human woman. And her name is Darcy Kimble.
So tell us what we see, Darcy.
MARIS:
OK, so this morning I woke up feeling pretty rough. Not really sure what was going on but… I woke up really late, maybe 8 a.m. I’m supposed to be at work at 8 a.m.
So I threw on my ill-fitting clothes which I get the used clothing shop, which is really frowned upon by most humans. But I like going there, because I’m into the non-humans, the fairies, the centaurs and things, and so I kind of want to dress the way they do. So I have a sort of ill-fitting, like a fairy jersey, and some centaur pants that only fit two legs, so I just put them on. Just because you know, I don’t want to look like the other humans. Also I don’t have a lot of money, so.
So anyway I’m rushing through the vendors I’m supposed to get to the cafeteria. I’m supposed to be serving breakfast. And now we’re already heading towards lunch. Hopefully my boss won’t notice. So I try and sneak through the back long hallway.
SEA:
Awesome. And tell me, what does Darcy look like, aside from the clothing?
MARIS:
So I’ve got spiky brown hair which I find really hard to keep down and keep tamed. I’ve got these greenish eyes, but in certain lights they look almost yellow, so they lean towards yellow… I’m only about 5′4″ or so, pretty skinny, ’cause I don’t get to eat a lot.
SEA:
And wearing pants that have two extra sets of legs, so they’re dragging—
MARIS:
Yeah, which I sort of—no, no, actually I’ve tied them up to my waist in this cool sort of style. And occasionally I flip one of the legs around, you know, just to seem cool. Or what Darcy thinks might be considered cool.
SEA:
Love it. OK. All right, so you’re working your way in. So Darcy works at the People’s Museum of Culture and Prosperity.
MARIS:
In the cafeteria. Yeah. As a line worker.
SEA:
Yeah. So Darcy, to get to her job, she would come in the main entrance. So it’s a pretty impressive building. Like, most of the buildings in Steadfast are really more monumental and massive and imposing. This is more wide steps, and people are allowed to come in to see the museum.
MARIS:
Yeah. It’s pretty imposing. But I go in the back entrance, actually, to get to the cafeteria. I don’t want anyone to see me.
SEA:
All right. OK, so Darcy’s coming in the back entrance. You come to guard station, and you see Gordo sitting there, the guard, sort of looking bored and he’s like,
SEAN (AS GORDO)
Name badge.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Gordo, you see me every day.
SEAN (AS GORDO)
I don’t know who you are yet. I haven’t seen your name badge.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Here’s the name badge.
SEAN (AS GORDO)
Yup. Still you, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Still me. Still me.
SEAN (AS GORDO)
Yup. Okay. All right, you can go through.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thanks, Gordo.
SEAN (AS GORDO)
Weren’t you supposed to be here for the first shift?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know what you’re talking about. See ya, Gordo! Bye!
SEA:
Darcy, you turn left down the employee-only corridor you have gone down a hundred if not a thousand times on your way to the cafeteria, when you are stopped dead in your tracks. Because immediately to your right is a pair of golden gleaming doors, underneath a giant curved sign that reads The Hall of Wonders.
MARIS:
Okay, so I stop, and I have this satchel and I’m pulling out my apron and my hair net. I’m starting to put it on, but as I’m putting this stuff on, I’m really looking at this door and I’m thinking, was this here yesterday? I’m sure this wasn’t here yesterday. Did I miss it? And I’m thinking I’m so late! But also this door is so fascinating.
Soft, mysterious music begins.
SEA:
This was not here yesterday. It was not here the day before. In fact, the blank walls sort of turn gold and angle in, leading you to this pair of doors… and one of them is open a crack.
MARIS:
OK. So I slowly approach the door and just peek through the crack to see what’s in there.
SEA:
OK. And it’s a little dark inside, but you see an exhibit where they have beams of light coming down on different things that are sort of in the walls in behind glass.
MARIS:
So I look around see if anyone’s watching, and I crack open the door a little more, and I just sidle through to try and see some of these exhibits that I’ve never seen before.
SEA:
So first of all, as you’re coming in, the lights are all on and you see that in most of the room the lights are lighting up empty displays. But you’re walking past three or four… and there are things that you don’t even know what they are. And considering that you’ve probably seen the whole museum…
MARIS:
Yes.
SEA:
And the museum only has what’s currently available in Steadfast right? Like, you know everything else in the museum. There’s nothing unusual in this museum.
MARIS:
Right.
SEA:
Everything in this room is insanely unusual. You see what looks like a flat piece of I don’t know. Gleaming something it’s like a rectangle and it’s got writing on it and a strip, and it says CREDIT.
And then you see like this round object that has all these markings on it, and it says V‑A-S‑E. And you’re not sure what that is. And they’re just like all these like weird things in here just like they’re alien… it’s like a joke.
MARIS:
So I look at each of these items and I’m trying to figure out how they fit in, or what they might be from. Because usually what I’m used to in the main part is, they’ll have like the Observatron 2000 and then the Observatron 3000 and then the Observatron 4000.
SEA:
Right.
MARIS:
So it’s all just the same. So I have no idea what to make of this. I’m just completely agog at what’s going on here.
SEA:
And then you realize what time and that you’ve been spending time in here.
MARIS:
(gasps)
OK. Now do I have my little camera clicker here?
SEA:
Yes.
MARIS:
OK so I I take it out and I’m taking a few pictures of the stuff because I’m just… this is wild. It’ll be great to show the centaur later.
SEA:
OK.
MARIS:
So I take these pictures, and I run back out through the door and I just close it again to the crack that it was closed at.
SEA:
And you hear a…
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
Ahem!
MARIS:
And I turn around to look at who’s coughing.
SEA:
And you see the head curator of the museum standing there, frozen, like he was getting something out of a bag. And he’s just looking at you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(nervous)
Hey, Mr. Sootweather! How are you today?
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
(a stiff, older man)
Very well. Were you, um, just in that room?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I… might have stepped into it for a minute?
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
Why?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, I… my hair net, see, which I have on my head now, just kind of fell into the room and I had to just grab it, but I didn’t see anything—
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
Where do you work?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, I’m at the cafeteria.
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
Yes. And what’s your employee number?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s 58432.
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
(noting this)
Thank you, 58432. That will be all.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK. Uh, I hope to see you later at the cafeteria. I know you enjoy, uh… the zesty casserole!
MARIS:
And I run down the hall as fast as I can.
SEA:
OK. So you get into line, and as you’re running you’re dropping things, picking them back up… You just catch a glimpse of someone watching you. And at first you think it’s Sootweather. And then you realize that it’s a minotaur, which you’ve seen before. But he’s wearing like dusty blue overalls and a weird hat. And he then just turns away and goes between two columns and walks away. But you get the sense that he was watching you.
MARIS:
OK. So I look down after him but I don’t want to engage, because I’m already really late and I’ve already got in trouble with Mr. Sootweather. So I’m just trying keep a low profile now.
SEA:
OK. So you make it to, you know… And Macey is there, and Macey’s like,
SEAN (AS MACEY)
(whispering)
Oh my god! I covered for you, but you’re really pushing it!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
I know. I know. I know, I just…
SEAN (AS MACEY)
Quick. Get on the casserole.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK. OK. I’m on the casserole here. Did anyone notice, do you think?
SEAN (AS MACEY)
No no no, we covered. We covered. We said you were like, making stuff out back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excellent. Good cover.
SEAN (AS MACEY)
I hope it was worth it. I hope he or she was worth it!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, it’s fine.
SEA:
So you’re serving out casserole, it’s an endless line…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(lifeless monotone)
Hi. Wednesday is Surprise Day. Would you like the Mystery Flan, the Mystery Bake or the Mystery Soup?
SEAN (AS VISITOR)
What’s in the Mystery Soup?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, it’s Surprise Day. You know that’s what they like to do here at the cafeteria on Wednesdays. We can’t tell you, but you can have it Original or Zesty or Party.
SEAN (AS VISITOR)
Zesty.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Zesty it is. Here you go. Enjoy your meal.
SEA:
(a glop of casserole on a plate)
(Thwock.)
SEAN (AS VISITOR)
Thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hail Boltius.
SEA:
OK. So it’s line after line… and then at one point, you see him again watching you.
MARIS:
The minotaur.
SEA:
Yeah. So he’s sitting out in the main food area. He’s not eating… but you sort of meet his gaze, and then he slowly turns away and goes to looking at something else.
MARIS:
OK. So I turn to Macey and I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey, Macey. Do you see…
SEAN (AS MACEY)
Yeah, what? Are you out of casserole already?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, not yet. No one ever takes the casserole. You know that.
SEAN (AS MACEY)
Yeah I know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you see that minotaur sitting out in the food court?
SEAN (AS MACEY)
What minotaur? Where?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The minotaur, right over there—
SEA:
He’s not there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He was right there. I could’ve sworn. I feel like he’s watching me or something. Anyway I’m probably just imagining…
SEAN (AS MACEY)
You OK?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, I think so.
SEAN (AS MACEY)
(teasing)
Was it a late night, maybe? A little too much Impescor soda?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(laughs weakly)
Yeah, that’s it I’m sure, yeah. OK.
SEA:
All right, so you guys are like washing up. You know you’re finishing up the end of your shift. You basically worked an hour shift. So lunch is sort of the end of your shift, and cleaning up, and all the girls and guys and everything are starting to hang up their aprons and they’re like,
SEAN (AS CO-WORKERS)
See you tomorrow!
SEA:
Macey’s like,
SEAN (AS MACEY)
See you tomorrow! Maybe!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ll be here. I’ll see you tomorrow.
SEAN (AS MACEY)
All right.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right. See you later.
SEA:
OK. So everyone’s sort of going off and heading out through the back corridors.
MARIS:
So I follow.
SEA:
OK. So you’re going along the back corridors and you hear a clopping of feet in a corridor behind you.
MARIS:
OK. So I stop and I turn around.
SEA:
You don’t see anything.
MARIS:
Hmm. So now I’m moving a little faster so try and catch up with Macey and the rest of them.
SEA:
OK. so you’re running. You’re trying to catch up, and all of a sudden an arm grabs you and pulls you in between two pillars.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
Hey! What the—
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
(low, gentle voice)
Shh. Quiet. I will explain.
SEA:
And you see the minotaur in the dusty coveralls, the hat. He lets go of you, holds his hands up like he doesn’t mean you any harm. And he holds a finger up to his lips, and says,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Shhh.
SEA:
And he gestures. And there’s a small gap between the pillars that leads over towards the public side, right? Which you don’t ever generally go any more, because there’s nothing to see there. And he’s gesturing you forward, towards the public side.
MARIS:
So I look around a bit, and I follow him hesitantly…
SEA:
As you get closer, and he moves one more pillar forward and sort of gestures for you to join him. You see that Mr. Sootweather is actually interacting with one of the Centurions.
And as a citizen of Steadfast, your blood runs cold just seeing Sootweather talk to a Centurion, and remembering your interaction with Sootweather.
And a Centurion is an eight-foot-tall exoskeleton. It’s half soldier, half tank. They speak out of a box on their shoulder. They’re riddled with weapons. They are designed for mass warfare, and yet they patrol the streets. And their justice is… swift. People just disappear.
And the Centurion is saying,
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
(harsh, robotic voice)
State your business.
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
Yes, yes. I’m trying to, you confounded machine.
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
State your business.
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
(sighs)
I have stated it twice.
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
State your business, citizen.
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
I run this establishment. And I need you to pull in a cafeteria worker for interrogation, and then disposal. Normal procedure.
SEA:
There’s a pause while that sinks in for you, and the minotaur sort of puts a hand on you not to bolt. And the Centurion says,
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
Proceed. State name.
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
I told you my name.
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
State name of appointee for interrogation.
SEAN (AS MR. SOOTWEATHER)
Oh, it’s Cafeteria Worker 58431. Or maybe it was 54832—just do plus or minus 5. Get them all—you’ll get her.
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
Very well. Submitting orders now.
SEA:
The minotaur leans down beside your ear and says,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
(whispering)
Do you have a safe place?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…My house?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
That’s not safe.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…Your house?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
(sighs)
The room you found today.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Do you remember where it is?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, it’s just down the hallway.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Okay. In a moment—
SEA:
All of a sudden your card, your employee card that you’re wearing, starts beeping.
SEAN (AS EMPLOYEE CARD VOICE)
(a thin, automated voice)
Bong! Citizen 58432. Please report to the nearest Centurion for processing.
MARIS:
And I immediately cover it—I’m trying to rip it off and throw it on the floor, I don’t know if I can or…
SEA:
You can’t.
MARIS:
So I’m just covering it, like…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(grunts)
Nnghh!
SEA:
He’s like,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Go there now. Go.
And you see the Centurion turning towards your direction.
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
Citizen! Halt!
MARIS:
And I run.
SEA:
Okay so you’re running…
MARIS:
There’s no halting.
Laughter.
SEA:
You’re going to make a Defy Danger roll. You need to roll 2d6.
MARIS:
All right. And I roll… a 10. Booya.
SEA:
OK! So tell me what you want to happen.
MARIS:
Is 10 good?
MIK:
10 is great.
SEA:
You get… what do you want to happen?
MARIS:
So it’s like I have wings on my feet now. And I’m just soaring down the hallway. This Centurion can’t touch me… and I dive-roll just because I feel like it’s cooler, into the into the room with all the artifacts, and I slam the door shut… and I look around for—can I move one of these empty cabinets?
SEA:
No, they’re all part of the wall.
MARIS:
OK. So I’m looking for something to jam against the door; there is nothing. So I look around. Where… is there anywhere to hide is there another door?
SEA:
There is no other door out of this.
MARIS:
…out of this place? So now I’m cursing that friggin’ minotaur. I’m like,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What did he mean? Why am I in here?
MARIS:
I’m frantically looking at all the artifacts… is there anything going on?
SEA:
And so from outside you hear:
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
Citizen! Gun is armed! Citizen, halt!
SEA:
And you hear… it’s like a sound of metal striking metal, and you hear this roar. And you hear sparks. And you hear
SEAN (AS THE CENTURION)
(its voice begins to break up)
Citi—Ci—Citizen! Ha—a—alt—ha—!
SEA:
And you hear like more clanging of metal and then you hear the alarm sound.
An alarm begins to blare.
SEA:
Now as a citizen of Steadfast every once in a while you’ll hear the alarms like the last horrible explosion. They go across the entire city and it basically means it’s like lockdown. You get to safety… It basically means the Centurions are moving. So you hear the alarms going out over the whole city. But it’s muffled because you’re in this room… and then you hear a tap-tap-tap at the door.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There are no citizens in here. No citizens at all.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
(through the door)
It’s me, Darcy. Open the door.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Who’s “me”?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
The minotaur.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right.
MARIS:
So I slowly open the door and I let them just enter the room.
SEA:
So as soon as the door opens, the sound of the alarms gets so loud. it’s blaring everywhere. You hear the sounds of shutters coming down over windows, like, full lockdown. And he comes into the room.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Are you OK?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, but I don’t know what’s going on. This only happened that Thursday that we poisoned that guy who was high up at the—never mind, let’s not talk about that right now.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
You only have a few more seconds.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What do I do? Who are you? What’s going on?
SEA:
And all of a sudden…
The alarm ceases.
SEA:
Everything stops. The alarms stop. The lockdown stops. You hear everything just slowly halt. And he’s like,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
You’re about to find out, Darcy.
Darcy Kimble, you may be one of the only people to experience what just happened. And I’m happy to report… I’m still here to see it too. We weren’t sure about that. Come.
SEA:
And he opens the door and it’s just silence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(breaking down)
Are you going to tell me what’s going on here? Because I was just supposed to come into work and serve people some mystery crap, Zesty or Original or Party. And now I’m stuck in this room with a minotaur and I don’t know what’s going on!
SEA:
And he steps out into the hall. He says,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
I can’t explain it. You have to see it, Darcy.
SEA:
And he starts walking back towards where the Centurion was.
MARIS:
So I just sort of stand in the middle of the room for a minute…
SEA:
There’s nothing. There’s no sound. Everything just seems… weird.
MARIS:
(with growing determinatino)
So then I remove my hair net, and I remove my apron, and I stuff it into my satchel. And I straighten myself up, and I try and screw up my courage… and I march after this minotaur wherever he’s going.
SEA:
OK.
Footsteps.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Where is everybody? Why is it so quiet?
SEA:
And he turns to you and he says,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
This is the end, Darcy. This is the event that ends everything.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know what that is.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
It’s more than I can explain to you. But come. You have to see it.
SEA:
And he walks towards the front steps and pushes open one of the doors and steps out onto the street.
MARIS:
And I follow, eyes very wide.
SEA:
So as you step out you see the street is there, the buildings… some of the vendor stalls… but there are no people. There are no trams. There is what looks like a broken down vehicle, because it’s not moving, and it’s right sort of there on the road in front of you. But it’s not moving, it’s not buzzing. And as far as you can see in both directions, there’s just no life. There is no sound. There is this strange tang, scent to the air…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(weakening again)
I don’t know what’s going on. Maybe we should find Gordo. Gordo might know what’s going on. He runs security here. Have you met Gordo? I don’t know, but I think he’s usually at the back entrance and maybe we should go and look around for him or something because I don’t know what’s going on.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
I understand. We can. We can go and look around, Darcy… But I think first, you need to just see this. Because this is what it looks like everywhere right now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is it… just everywhere, like this?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is the Emperor still alive?
Pause.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
We actually don’t know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(softly)
Hail Boltius.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Hail… Boltius… citizen. Did I say that right? I need to work on that for later.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s good enough for now.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
I don’t know how to make this easy for you, Darcy. I’m a hunter. I don’t normally deal with people… but it’s really important that you understand what has happened. So where do you want to go so that you can fully realize…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I would go to my home but I usually get there on the tram. It’s a long way to walk. Could you carry me? You seem pretty big. We might get there faster that way.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
I’m happy to carry you.
SEA:
And he kneels down, and puts you piggyback. And he starts to run like, cloppity cloppity. He moves pretty fast.
MARIS:
And I think Darcy’s kind of in shock, ’cause she wouldn’t normally ride piggyback on a minotaur, but this seems like exceptional circumstances so… she’s just sort of clinging to him, just not knowing what to do.
SEA:
And so he stops at different cross streets so you can sort of look around and then he just waits for you to tell him which way to go from there.
MARIS:
So I give him directions all the way back to my little hovel.
SEA:
OK. So you work your way all the way back—is it one of the skyscrapers?
MARIS:
Yeah, yeah. I’m in one of the skyscraper buildings, in a really small unit.
SEA:
OK. So he brings you back to one of the residence buildings. And it’s that’s where I think it really starts to hit you. Because the city has got its problems… but when you get to the residences, which is where all the not-well-off people are, there’s like, sharing and laughter and talking and… and there’s not a sound. It’s as if the motes in the air aren’t moving, like the dust. There’s something surreal about the whole experience, to where you’re not even sure if you’re dreaming or awake. And he sets you down.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Are you okay to walk up to your unit?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Will you come with me?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Of course.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right. Let’s go.
SEA:
He follows you.
MARIS:
So I try and summon a Moveator. Are they working?
SEA:
Yep. It dings, comes down.
An elevator opens, and the same soothing music plays.
MARIS:
Okay, so I get in the Moveator, and I go up to the 16th floor where my unit is, 1625.
SEA:
(hums along)
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum… bing!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, so here we go…
MARIS:
I look around, and I step into the hallway.
SEA:
It’s very weird. You see like a toy out in the hall, just abandoned.
MARIS:
So then I run along the corridor, and I’m just knocking on doors.
SEA:
Yup. One door swings open…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(calling)
Mrs Sitwell? Anyone?
SEA:
(softly)
Empty.
MARIS:
And I just… Nothing?
SEA:
Nothing.
MARIS:
So I turned to the minotaur and I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine! I believe you! Everyone’s gone. Where are they? What’s going on?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
I’m not the one to explain that to you and we don’t have a lot more time. I just needed you to see it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, this is great. Could you send the person who does know what’s going on?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Yes, I can.
SEA:
And he pulls out this… it’s like a beetle. It’s made of gleaming metal with little legs and wings tucked on it, and it’s beautiful… It’s about six inches tall. And he hands it to you and he says,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
This is a Grissom device. It will take you to the person that can answer your questions.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK. How do I know you’re telling me the truth?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Well, you don’t have a lot of choice.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That is true.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
We don’t know exactly how long we have in this stream.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So you need me to activate this little beetle guy?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
Yeah. So I can activate it for you, or you can activate it yourself. It has to become part of you to work.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Whoa.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
It does hurt.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This just… none of this sounds good. What do you mean, part of me?
SEA:
He reaches out his hand. He takes it from and he presses the button on the back, and all the feet sssnick out as blades that are about two inches deep. And he says,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
So, you basically…
SEA:
And he presses it again and the feet-blades go away, and he puts it against his arm. He says,
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
You place it on a part of your body and press the button and it will take over from there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ve never been a fan of feet blades. Is this the only way?
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
I can tranquilize you first and then do it for you…
MARIS:
My eyes screw up, and I close them really hard and I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. Fine. Just… just put it on me and you activate it.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
(softly)
It’s an honor to meet you, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
If you are screwing around with me I’m going to come back and—
SEA:
And then you just hear this pain, this like, sharp pain into your arm as it latches in and grabs on…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Aagh!
SEA:
And then the world goes white. And you actually see all of existence for a brief nanosecond…
Darcy lets out an unearthly scream that breaks up into reverberating echoes, then silence.
SEA:
…and then everything goes dark.
EPILOGUE: THE PATH TO THE GLAD:
Wind chimes and birdsong.
ANANKA (VOICE-OVER)
So you see? Our visitors are on their way. Not too much longer, Cyrus.
Tweeter flutters up.
TWEETE:
What you reading?
CYRU:
It’s called Your Existential Crisis.
TWEETE:
That’s a big word, isn’t it? How do you fit that in your backpack?
CYRU:
(slight chuckle)
It’s not easy.
TWEETE:
Ooo. What does it mean?
CYRU:
I don’t think we have… no, we’ve got plenty of time to explain it.
TWEETE:
There’s always time for existential crisises!
(beat)
I have no idea what that means.

"End Notes, Episode 1","General hubbub.
SEA:
OK, we’ll do the debrief, then we get to have snacks.
MIK:
There’s snacks.
MARIS:
Somebody already has a snack…
CARTE:
I was told it was break!
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCER (ELI)
The End of Time and Other Bothers: End Notes. Episode 1.
SEA:
So hi everyone, welcome to the first aftershow—we’re going to come up with a name for that at some point.
My name is Sean Howard and I am the GM.
MARIS:
I’m Marisa and I play Darcy the human.
CARTE:
And I’m Carter, and I am playing as Blat the half-demon.
MIK:
I’m Mike and I play Eggerton.
SEA:
So this is our first debrief or—we don’t know what to call these yet. So this is for fans, for us to just talk about any questions you had, moments—blah blah blah, and also so we can just talk about what I’d planned versus what happened, which is sometimes really funny, drastically different… or anything else we want to talk about.
So I guess I’ll start it, but anyone can start these debriefs, but basically, I was blown away by the three characters, because we’d never really done this format of shared story where everyone could just start telling a story, so I thought that was really cool.
MIK:
I had nightmarish flashbacks to Grade 11 Creative Writing, and the teacher saying, “Michael, can you give your presentation on that Shakespeare reading?” and getting up in front of the class and having no idea. So I had to make up Othello.
MARIS:
That’s very good. That takes talent.
MIK:
Yeah, and you know what, I did not have a teacher that agreed with that sentiment.
MARIS:
(laughs)
Did you just say he was a fellow? “Well, there was a fellow…”
MIK:
“There was a fellow. And he was named Othello. Yo.”
No, I just rambled for five minutes, which is what I did today.
SEA:
So you had a question.
MIK:
I did have a question. And I think it’s the question that everyone’s wondering: Marisa got this beautifully laid-out interaction, and there’s a minotaur that she rides, and there’s Centurions and battles and time freezes… and I got shot in the back with food on my face.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIK:
And I just feel like that’s a little unfair! I dunno.
SEA:
I don’t see a problem. Anybody else see a problem?
MARIS:
I think Sean just played to our strengths.
Laughter.
MIK:
I… I… I need an emotion break.
MARIS:
(laughing)
It’s true. Marisa did not show empathy.
SEA:
Yeah.
MIK:
She had fun without empathy.
SEA:
So it’s really funny. I actually, when I was trying to think of the structure of the show, I was like, OK, it’s going to be a little bit of character-building. We’ve got to start you in a world where then we’re instantly transporting you out of. It’s like the end of that world. And so I was like, is this going to be enough drama?
My plan was to hunt at least one of you, and I’m pointing at Carter/Blat or Michael/Eggl… I’ll use your character name…
MARIS:
(laughing)
Eglinton!
SEA:
So I’m pointing to Eggerton and I’m pointing to Blat. I was hoping to hunt one of you down in the street, right, like it’s a post-apocalyptic…
MIK:
(laughing)
I thought this was a fantasy comedy! And your secret plan all along was to hunt me down and murder me in the street.
SEA:
Well, not murder you…
MIK:
Oh, not murder, sorry.
SEA:
He was going to tranq—I kept calling it, when we were designing this, it was called “tag-and-bag”. He was going to tag and bag one of you.
MARIS:
Well, you did bag the fairy in the end.
SEA:
Because it’s like a world where everything’s gone and… and there’s this strange minotaur following you. I thought that might trigger some of your abilities or… I didn’t know. That’s what I thought was going to happen.
Laughter.
CARTE:
I’m a file clerk.
MARIS:
We used no abilities.
SEA:
Yeah. The demon clerk’s abilities… your file clerk abilities really did come up, though. They were good.
CARTE:
But now that the file room’s destroyed, he’s basically a useless member of this post-apocalyptic society.
MARIS:
Yeah. He’s rudderless.
SEA:
He’s rudderless. What’s he going to do for meaning now that he doesn’t have his…?
CARTE:
His life didn’t have much meaning before. He alphabetized files.
SEA:
And Marisa, you were saying you had a whole thing in the line that you wanted to do.
MARIS:
Yeah, I thought you were going to start me serving people in the line, and you did not! So I was going to have a whole spiel about how I offered the food, and I was going to chat with someone I had a crush on, but nooo. You just compressed that to like, fifteen seconds. And I did have a moment when you told me there was this fantasy door and I could go in, and I was going to be like, “Eh, whatever,” and just continue…
SEA:
I thought that’s what you were going to do!
MARIS:
But then I thought, no, you have to take offers—you can’t do that. So then I took the offer. Yeah.
CARTE:
“Yes, and”—“No, BUT.”
Laughter.
MARIS:
“No, but I’m late.”
SEA:
It would have been harder, yeah.
MARIS:
For my imaginary job.
CARTE:
Oh no, I’m going to lose my imaginary job.
SEA:
I loved—I wish I’d let you spend more time on it—I loved your experience of the museum, where it was the Something 1000, the Something 2000…
MARIS:
Yeah, it’s all just the same stuff but slightly different.
No, I’d made all sorts of notes from what they had discussed, like, “I’m going to work all this in!” But nooo. Never had a chance.
MIK:
I wonder how that feels, Marisa—to not have a chance to explore your character and ideas.
SEA:
I thought you did a good job exploring your character.
MARIS:
You did. You did a great job. You’re not good at presentations!
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
The exclamation point was a brilliant move. I thought, how’s he going to turn this around?
MARIS:
Yeah, that was so great.
MIK:
Yeah, I was pleased with that.
SEA:
Because I did not—yeah.
MIK:
(laughing)
The bodies on the next slide! I think we all had that same idea the second you said there’s another slide. “Yeah, that’s going to be a bad one.”
MARIS:
You spun that very well.
CARTE:
Well, I think the best way to spin it would simply be “Hey, we’re showing that the city can withstand a massive explosion! We’re all still here! Well, maybe not those people. But the rest of us are still here.”
Laughter.
SEA:
It’s the “Rest of Us Survived Celebration”.
MARIS:
Yeah. And there’s more resources for all of us!
SEA:
It’s the NIMBY celebration! “It wasn’t me!”
MIK:
(laughs)
Yeah. It was fun.
SEA:
Yeah. So my plans to hunt you guys down did not…
(laughing)
And we have this—Eli has this—we have spent weeks building this map of this world…
MARIS:
And now you’ve just exploded it.
SEA:
We didn’t visit any of the monuments…
MARIS:
But why? You had the control to do all that. Why didn’t you do the hunt down in the street thing?
SEA:
I know. I know. Well, that’s what’s interesting. Part of it is… when you’re just working on paper, you’re like, “Ah, this is how I could structure it…” but then when you’re in the moment, and you’re like…
I also didn’t know 100% where your characters were going to be until you showed up.
MARIS:
Yeah, that’s true.
SEA:
Everything—well, except you. Blat was… like, it was your initial idea. Right?
CARTE:
Yes. Yes. Yeah, from the beginning I thouhgt, this would be interesting if he was a half-demon, but basically lives like a person and has the world’s most boring office job, and is actually a pretty nerdy guy. Except he looks like Satan.
SEA:
But in this world that’s just accepted.
CARTE:
Yeah. It’s just another race. Yeah.
SEA:
Yeah. Whereas, where you’re going to go…
CARTE:
…I will be hunted for sport.
Laughter.
SEA:
Yeah, so your idea stayed pretty much the same, from your initial—and I loved it immediately, and I went and found a Neph… a Nephilim or whatever thing, and modified it. It’s like, a place to start with for your player book.
CARTE:
Right.
SEA:
And then we modified it. So you, Blat, though I didn’t know your name, I knew what you were going to be coming in. But I wasn’t 100% sure what you guys were going to be bringing in. So when you were like, “Yeah, I’m a flightless fairy…”
MIK:
Yeah.
SEA:
“…flightless, portly fairy, in a PR department,” and then you described your dress, like what you were dressed in all the way down… you were Corporate Guy.
MIK:
Yeah.
SEA:
Like, it was corporate all the way down. And in that moment, I was like, I can’t just throw him… Part of me wanted to do, what is it, Michael Douglas with the briefcase, trying to get home… what was that movie?
MARIS:
Oh yeah, I don’t remember the movie, but I know which one you mean.
CARTE:
Oh, Falling Down.
MIK:
Ohh.
SEA:
Part of me was like, do we do a Falling Down thing? But I was just like, no, I think it’s going to be too much fun to not do just the PR.
MARIS:
Yeah, it was great.
SEA:
You’re in the end of the world, in a horrible corporation, and you’re trying to do a horrible PR spin.
MARIS:
And Karen was just nasty.
SEA:
Plus when he just started going…
MARIS:
Oh, it was great.
SEA:
Michael, when you started eating the thing and just talking, and I was like, “Cut to ten minutes later,” and then you kept going… I was like, yeah, he’s just gotta be—
MIK:
That was a good comedic way to—because—one of the things that’s weird about this is that there’s no structure, there’s no “you’re going to do this and then you’re going to do that.” Like, in a Dungeons & Dragons-type format, typically it’s, yeah, we need to accomplish this thing right now.
MARIS:
Yeah.
SEA:
Right.
MIK:
And you do what you need to do to do that. With this format, you don’t have that specificity. So I sort of started going a direction… and no one stopped me. And I just kept going.
SEA:
Well, that’s the thing though. That’s an offer, right? So if you make that offer of just rambling… I actually was picturing you just standing at the window as the world had stopped…
Laughter.
MIK:
Yeah.
SEA:
Just eating your cookie, going on and on and on. And I was like, Greg’s just going to walk up and be like, “Well, this was an easy one,” and just, you know…
MIK:
I like that you name-dropped Greg at one point. Did you catch that?
MARIS:
No, I didn’t. He name-dropped…
MIK:
No, I was nodding at—I chin-nodded, ’cause I’m a dude, at Marisa—when Sean was talking to you, he said “Greg”.
MARIS:
Yes.
MIK:
Just out of nowhere.
SEA:
I know, I messed that up.
MIK:
I thought that was kind of funny.
MARIS:
Yes. I just assumed it was the minotaur.
MIK:
Minodaur?
MARIS:
Minotaur.
MIK:
Matador? Is that where that comes from?
MARIS:
Wait. Are you saying that Greg was the one who took them down? But he was nice to me!
MIK:
Well, that’s what I’m saying!
SEA:
Yep. Greg is the one who bagged and tagged you.
MARIS:
I thought they were different minotaurs!
CARTE:
It’s just rampant favouritism.
Laughter.
MIK:
You got to interact with him, Carter.
SEA:
Yeah. And I felt we could have done more with your scene, but it was the first thing we did, so that went well…
MIK:
Yeah, it was fun.
SEA:
But we could have built that up more, even more, I think.
CARTE:
We’ll just cut to the chase…
MIK:
I liked the “You shot me!”
SEA:
Yeah. Like, cut to… we probably could have done a cut to… that would have been funnier. You with the thing stuck up there and… yeah.
MARIS:
I enjoyed the pneumatic tube explosion. That was great.
MIK:
(laughs)
How did you come up with all those names just…
(snaps fingers)
right off the top of your head?
MARIS:
Yeah.
CARTE:
Through the power of… knowing some names.
Laughter.
MIK:
Because I wrote down a bunch of them. We’ve got the… I wrote down “pneumatic tube” which isn’t a thing—it is a thing…
MARIS:
It is.
MIK:
And that’s why it’s not a thing.
CARTE:
It’s a thing. Well, when I was told that this was the 20th-century office…
MARIS:
Aren’t you doing Brazil?
CARTE:
Yeah, it is Brazil, but a lot of 1950s offices, that’s all they had, pneumatic tubes. And I will honestly say, I’m jealous that I’ve never worked in a place that had pneumatic tubes.
SEA:
Me too.
CARTE:
Because it just seems like super fun.
MARIS:
So much fun.
CARTE:
But I’m sure… It’s gotta be highly dangerous. Like, people are probably getting their hands stuck up there and…
SEA:
It’s loud! It’s like shhhunk!
CARTE:
It’s loud. And I’m sure that if like, exposed skin hit a pneumatic tube, it’s like getting the world’s worst hickey.
So that’s probably why they stopped. Because they were like, why have we got this air compression system when people could just hand other people things?
Laughter.
MIK:
I think email might have had something to do with it.
CARTE:
Email, yeah, emails. But just getting a little “bing!” on your computer isn’t the same as “THUNK. THUNK.”
(laughs)
MIK:
That’s my favourite.
MARIS:
And what I enjoyed was when it was exploding, he kept ramming the broom up there instead of… I would have stopped that, had my pneumatic tube been…
SEA:
Yeah, Carter, that was a good lean in.
MARIS:
Yeah, Carter doubles down, as they say.
CARTE:
You have to save the files. Because that’s literally all that I do.
Laughter.
SEA:
So yeah. So we have spent weeks. We have these beautiful maps which we’ll put online… I literally have—I think Eli wrote a 17-page file of the history and culture of Balgomarian Steadfast.
MARIS:
And we embraced none of it, right?
Laughter.
SEA:
No. We invented things like the Speechifyer.
CARTE:
Well, I think the problem was, you guys worked too long on it.
SEA:
Yeah.
CARTE:
And then, in the moment, when you’re doing the adventure, you’re like, “Wow. I am so bored of this. We’re not going to talk about any of it.”
SEA:
No. And plus trying to recall it all. But the good news is there still may be chances to move back and forth between the two times, so it’s not like it’s all for nothing.
CARTE:
Well, like flashbacks.
SEA:
Yeah. Flash-forwards, I think you called them.
CARTE:
Right. Because it’s happening in the future, even though this is something that happened when our characters were younger.
SEA:
Yes.
MIKE and MARIS:
Wut.
Laughter.
SEA:
What’s that movie of a movie in a movie? If we’re going there…
MIK:
Serendipity?
MARIS:
No, he’s talking about the one beginning with I, aren’t you.
SEA:
Yeah.
MARIS:
The one that Carter—Inception.
SEA:
Inception.
CARTE:
Inception, yeah.
MIK:
Ohhh.
SEA:
It was a very Inception kind of…
CARTE:
Yeah.
MIK:
As long as it’s not Memento.
MARIS:
I like Memento.
MIK:
How do you… how do you know it’s a thing?
I think someone filmed a movie and then went and cut it literally in pieces and glued it together without looking.
MARIS:
And it was brilliant.
MIK:
Yeah. No, that’s the empty canvas. I mean, like “It’s brilliant art!”
SEA:
But that’s still brilliant!
CARTE:
I always wanted to own a physical copy of Memento because I heard that the DVD, there was a special feature that the movie was played backwards. So they took every scene and just rearranged them in the other direction so that the mystery is ruined, but everything’s played forward in real time.
SEA:
Yeah.
CARTE:
So you could just check and see if the story actually makes sense.
MIK:
Ahhhh.
CARTE:
But that’s only on the DVD and well, it’s a Blu-Ray world now, my friend, so I’ve missed that chance.
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
So, what did you guys think about, the two of you that are playing characters that don’t really have any moves. That wasn’t a big deal, right?
MARIS:
No.
SEA:
Like, you were playing… Yeah, okay.
MIK:
I didn’t have a chance to do anything, so… you know, got shot in the back…
MARIS:
I had a sick dive roll, I might remind you.
SEA:
You did have a sick dive roll. You forward tumble-rolled into a room.
MARIS:
That’s right.
SEA:
Yeah, because like, I don’t know if I’d ever do that again, because having to create versions of all the sheets that are—because basically, I don’t know if we can explain it now: everyone is like a level 0. Right, like you’re a level 0 character. You’ve chosen a race but not a class.
MARIS:
Yeah, can I just read one of the starting moves that Sean has provided us with? It’s called Navigating Bureaucracy. “You take +1 on any rolls involving paperwork, bureucrats or waiting in line for something.” And none of us got to use it.
CARTE:
Literally never came up.
MARIS:
But it’s a pretty great starting move.
SEA:
OK, cool. So the basic idea is that in the next one, we’ll see how it goes compared to what’s planned. But yeah, at some point we’ll be choosing classes. With the exception of Blat, who is something very special.
MARIS:
(laughs)
He’s a class unto himself.
CARTE:
I’m a class unto—that’s just the fanciest, nicest way to put that.
MIK:
I thought he was just kind of a jerk.
MARIS:
(laughs)
I think he’s delightful.
SEA:
So thanks to everyone for listening, and we will see you guys in about a week with the next episode if all is going as planned.
MIK:
Woo!
CARTE:
(leaning in close)
And then things didn’t go as planned.
Laughter.

Fast-paced music.
ANNOUNCE:
Last time on The End of Time and Other Bothers…
SEAN (AS BOSS)
(over phone line)
We don’t have the correct files from that accident case last week.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll pneumatic tube it up, sir! And that’s a good day from Blat. Long live Boltius!
SEAN (AS KAREN)
Eggerton, actually we need to spin this whole thing and come up with some great reason why it’s a celebration.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The large explosion … was a celebration.
SEAN (AS KAREN)
Yes.
SEA:
There’s nothing unusual in this museum.
MARIS:
Right.
SEA:
Everything in this room is alien… it’s like a joke.
SEAN (AS CENTURION)
(harsh, robotic voice)
State name of appointee for interrogation.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(breaking down)
I was supposed to come into work and serve people some mystery crap and now I’m stuck in this room with a minotaur and I don’t know what’s going on.
SEAN (AS THE MINOTAUR)
This is the end, Darcy. This is the event that ends everything.
SEA:
He pulls the trigger and this dart buries itself right into your chest.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ow! I don’t see how this is helpful!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ow! What was that? It smells kind of funny.
(slurring)
Whaaa…
He collapses.
SEA:
It’s like a beetle. It’s made of gleaming metal. It’s like sharp pain into your arms as it latches in and grabs on and then the world goes white.
Darcy lets out an unearthly scream that breaks up into reverberating echoes. The music ends.
Soft wind chimes.
ANAKA (VOICE-OVER)
Time is a river. Everybody is like drops of water, carried along on the current along different paths. These three strange people you have met: the fairy, the human, and the half-demon, they are drops of water thrown up in the air like spray and just happened to land up the river. Many centuries up the river in fact.
The chimes fade out.
DARCY ARRIVE:
Forest birds sing in the background.
SEA:
We open far above Farloria. An eagle soars and we go with her, circling lower and lower. A giant set of waterfalls in the distance catches a glint of the sun as we come in above a clearing. And there is a very large stone in the center of it that glows and flashes. And the eagle banks away suddenly as Darcy appears in the center of the glade.
A crackle and a powerful explosion. Birds flutter away in panic.
A violent rushing sound, heard from Darcy’s point of view.
SEA:
Darcy, the world flashes and constricts in on you and then explodes apart and everything is swimming. The ground is moving…
And you suddenly feel under your hands… soil.
The noise fades. Gradually, the birds resume singing.
SEA:
And it takes a few seconds for your vision to come back, but you realize you are on a glade on a slight knoll. And there is a perfect circle of straight white trees that go up into a stunningly blue sky, unlike any sky you’ve ever seen. And in the center of this circular glade is a very large stone, as big as a Balgem truck, with a giant crack down the center of it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(groans)
MARIS:
Darcy pushes herself up slowly and looks around.
Since she has only lived after the Balgomarian Revolution, has she ever seen anything like this in terms of greenery and vegetation?
SEA:
Darcy would have seen the very manicured gardens around the palace.
MARIS:
And she would have been allowed into those?
SEA:
Yes, as long as you never picked or touched anything or broke anything. There were just constant gardeners moving around tending them. To see this grass beneath you might be a little strange. You would have seen small trees that were carefully pruned. These are massive, and they go up so high and the sky is sort of disconcerting and it’s not grey.
MARIS:
So, she’s pushed herself up to her knees now and I think just for a few seconds she actually revels in this feeling of her hands on this earth and this grass that she’s never really experienced. Because if you got down your knees in those gardens I imagine you were prodded along pretty quickly. So, she just takes a minute and then she slowly gets up to her feet…
SEA:
And that’s when you feel a sharp pain on your arm.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ow!
SEA:
The beetle detaches hits the ground and scurries away.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(wincing)
Ah, geez.
Wait, where’s that minotaur? Hello? Are you still here? Hello? Mr. Minotaur?
MARIS:
She goes to see where the beetle went just in case there’s any hope of following it. But I guess it’s disappeared.
SEA:
Yeah, you lose it pretty quickly it’s off into the forest and grass.
Now, you do see a path leading down from this knoll and you see what looks to be a sign of some kind. When you first look at the sign it’s written in a strange language. And then it’s like your vision goes a little blurry and then clears and you can suddenly read the sign. The sign is in old paint and it’s peeling, and it reads: THIS WAY TO PARADOX.
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
The End of Time and Other Bothers. An improvised fantasy role-playing game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your gamemaster is Sean Howard, with players Marisa King, Carter Siddall, and Michael Howie.
Episode 2: The Academy of the Fallen, Part 1.
SEA:
Darcy, you crest a rise and the path curves and you see a log ahead. And there’s what appears to be a man, a very short man, leaning against the log, and he’s reading a book.
MARIS:
So, Darcy’s first emotion is one of relief: there’s finally someone here who might be able to help her. I run over.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(breathless)
Excuse me! Excuse me, sir, can you help me?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
(gloomy as ever)
Sorry, I’m just reading this… right here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. I can see that. I’m really sorry to interrupt you, but it’s just that I … I don’t know where I am or what’s happening and … And I’m wondering do you live around here? Can you tell me where I am?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Oh. Yeah. It sounds like you need this book even more than me.
SEA:
He closes the book and hands it to you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are you reading?
MARIS:
And I take the book and I look at the cover.
SEA:
Again, at first, it looks alien and then it blurs and comes together, and you can read it, and it says, My Existential Crisis.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Actually, I don’t think I need a book—
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
It gets really good by about page 30.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I might look at it later…
MARIS:
And she clutches the book closer.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…but right now, I just need your help to know where I am.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Oh, wow. You really do need that book.
SEA:
He stands up. He’s like:
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
This is the path to Paradox. And this is a log on the way to the path to Paradox.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, So I guess Paradox is the nearest town?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Now we’re getting somewhere. And I’m here to take you there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t understand what’s going on. Could you just tell me who you are and what’s happening here?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
My name, sorry, is Cyrus. I am your servant sent to fetch you with no regard for my feelings in the matter I might add.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, no, I’m not a noble person or anything. I think you have me confused with someone else. I just need to get home.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Just walk with me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK.
MARIS:
So, I start following him because he’s the only lifeline I have in this world.
SEA:
You’re still clutching the book?
MARIS:
I’m still clutching the book.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I’ll take you all the way to the school and then I’ll come back for the others. Assuming there are any.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m not going to any school. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Trust me you’ll want to go to the school. They’ll be able to answer your questions. No one else will.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right then just take me there.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I think that’s what we’re doing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. Maybe faster? A little faster?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
OK.
SEA:
(laughing)
And he keeps going at the same speed.
A gentle acoustic version of the theme tune plays.
SEA:
You crest the hill, and you see ahead of you a massive valley that leads down and forward to a set of cliffs. The cliffs must be 300 feet tall and even from here you can start to hear the roar of a waterfall that’s pounding down into the valley.
Nestled up right against that cliff and right against the side of that waterfall is a town. And even from here you can see that it’s a town unlike any town you’ve ever seen before, Darcy. There are thatched roofs and it looks like people milling about and there’s no vehicles or Balgem trucks or monorails.
And that’s what you see as Cyrus pauses beside you for a second… and then tightens his backpack and heads down towards the town.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Come along. We’ll be there soon.
The music ends. We hear cheerful, chattering voices in the distance, growing louder.
SEA:
As you come into the town you start to pass a pair of talking goats that are going the other way, and you see people taking what appears to be food in carts coming and going and there are new smells. And you’re starting to weave your way down towards the town.
You’re following the river and you see that the river curves around to the left and another a river appears to the right side of the town. And Cyrus is starting to lead you in. And as you’re getting closer to the sound of the waterfall is growing and you’re starting to also get a little wet. There’s like a light mist.
The voices of the townsfolk are drowned out by the sound of the waterfall as it grows to a heavy roar.
SEA:
And it’s almost overwhelming because it’s not ordered, it’s not structured. There’s people shouting and running around. You see kids laughing… and it’s just chaos to you.
And now it’s getting really loud as you come up to the base of the cliff. It’s hard to speak or be heard over the roar and you are getting soaked by the water coming off the falls. And he stops before a massive set of open gates and above them on the top—and this time you can read it right away—it says: THE ACADEMY OF THE FALLEN.
MARIS:
So first of all, I very carefully wrapped my extra centaur leg pieces around the book so that it doesn’t get soaked like the rest of me is. And I look up at this gate and I say to him:
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(muttering)
This really doesn’t bode well. You’re taking me to the Academy of The Fallen? What about the School for The Gifted? That would be a better name.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
(shouting)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(raising her voice)
I said… uh… Never mind. Is this the school?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Huh?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
School? OK, just… just keep going!
SEA:
He shakes his… He just points, he points up the path.
MARIS:
And I shrug my shoulders at him as if to say, Are you not coming with me?
SEA:
He shakes his head, and he goes to reach for the book.
MARIS:
And I clutch it closer.
SEA:
He just slumps shoulders and nods. And then he turns starts walking back into town away from you. You’re standing in front of these gates that lead up to the school. And the academy that you can see up the path is a three story building that’s large sandstone blocks with strangely out of place Gothic features. The arches are all those pointed arches and it’s got ornate towers coming off of it.
MARIS:
So, I have a moment of panic when he turns and walks away from me. But he said all the answers were here, so I start marching up towards what looks like the biggest building.
SEA:
So, we leave Darcy as she slumps her shoulders and starts walking up to the very large building on the grounds of the Academy of The Fallen.
BLAT AND EGGERTON ARRIV:
The roar of the waterfall gives way to the chirping of birds back in the glade.
SEA:
And we cut to the glade where the Fae stone suddenly lights up and lightning strikes out of it at two places on the ground and the sound of an explosion ripples through the air.
A rising electrical crackle, followed by two small explosions.
SEA:
And there are two bags in the centre of the glade.
And Blat, you come to consciousness first. And you’re a little constrained and your vision is a little weird.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(a long groan—comically, uncomfortably, ludicrously long)
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t feel well!
SEA:
And you’re not able to move your arm one of your arms. You appear to be laying wrapped in something.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(another comically long groan)
I need assistance! Ugh.
SEA:
And that’s when there was a sharp pain in the centre of your chest—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(a scream, nearly as long as the—)
Ugh, thank heavens that’s over.
SEA:
…as this large beetle pops off and starts scurrying around.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ugh, get away! Get! Ugh!
SEA:
It’s scurrying around you at your feet. And it’s starting to sort of come to you that you’re you’re wrapped. You’re in a… maybe in a giant canvas bag?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s like my fraternity days all over again.
Well, I guess that’s what the pointy bits on my head are for.
CARTE:
I just start scraping my head against the top. Maybe I can cut my way free with my horns.
SEA:
Yeah. It takes a little while but one of them suddenly breaks through. You hear a ripping sound and then the other one rips through.
CARTE:
And it’s just a big red head poking out of a bag, in the middle of a giant field.
SEA:
You see that you are in a glade, and there’s this very large stone in the centre of it and there’s a very bright, bright, too-bright blue sky.
CARTE:
So I’ll try to stand up to get completely free of the bag.
SEA:
OK, so you manage to rip your way out and the beetle scurries off.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ugh, get away!
CARTE:
I throw the bag at it.
SEA:
And that’s when you realize that there is another bag about eight to ten feet away.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Why did the minotaur put himself in a bag? That’s strange.
(calls, tentatively)
Hello? Minotaur?
CARTE:
I approach the bag. I start kicking at it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s what you get for shooting me! Lousy minotaur! Thought you could hide your identity by being in a bag! Well, take some of this! And this! Look, here’s what I’m going to do—I’m going to roll dice!
Laughter as Carter rolls actual dice.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’ve just taken seven points of damage, do you like that? You lousy minotaur.
SEA:
(laughing)
OK, so that is a… That is a hit. So, Carter, you just rolled an attack—that’s awesome. So that is a partial success. And so you manage to kick this bag pretty good… but you slip at the same time and fall onto this very strange…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(a protracted yell)
Aaaa! My spine!
SEA:
…soft ground. It sort of gives a little. It’s not like concrete or metal or balgeolium or any of those other substances you know. It’s like… it’s like potting soil, but a lot of it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I could do so much gardening here. But it looks like they have!
SEA:
So Eggerton, you come awake being kicked.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What, what’s going on? What? What? What? Ow! Did I get kicked several times?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(guilty)
That was the minotaur!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The minotaur? What minotaur? There’s a minotaur?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um… you didn’t see the minotaur?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I was giving a presententation. It was an excellent presentation I was giving, and then I was eating cakes and then there was a pokey. And now… Now you’re kick… Why is a minotaur kicking me? I would have thought they kick harder than that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It was… a very weak minotaur.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, thank heavens for that. Who, who are you? Why, why… why is it dark?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’re in a bag.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why am I in a bag? I don’t like being in bags.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You could just stand up. You should be able to free yourself quite easily.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK.
MIK:
So I stand up and poke my head out the top of the conveniently-loosely-tied bag.
SEA:
You’re both standing in a perfectly circular glade with a very large stone. And to you, Blat, it just looks like a massive stone with a giant crack through it.
But for Eggerton, it glows.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
SEA:
It is unlike anything you ever felt or seen. And for some reason, though you’ve never even heard of one or seen one, you know that it is a Fae stone.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
The stone of Fae…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You muttered something there very dramatically. I’m not sure what you said.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m not dramatic. I don’t think that was me. This stone is a very nice stone, wouldn’t you say?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(uncertain)
Yes.
SEA:
And that’s when you hear a whistling coming down the path. A rather sad sounding song is being whistled, which is sort of unusual for a whistle. And it appears to be getting closer.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This must be it: the minotaur is coming back.
My friend, you and I have been roofied by a minotaur. We’ll have to stand here and… stand our ground.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But I’m already standing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… We’re ahead of the game. So steel yourself!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Steal? How do I steal myself I already am myself?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just get ready. Whoever did this to us maybe coming so prepare for badness.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t want badness.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You already, you already have badness. You were in a bag and now you’re in a field…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s actually a very nice field though, I quite like this stone…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…And I don’t know where we are…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…And it shines and I feel kind of loving…
SEA:
And you see a hat. The top of a head and a hat start to crest up the trail leading into this glade.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
He was wearing a hat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who was wearing a hat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The minotaur was wearing a hat! He put me in a bag after shooting… you see this hole in my shirt? This is what happened. Something similar happened to you, didn’t it?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t remember. I was giving a presentation and I was nailing the presentation, because you see, there was this extremely devastating explosion.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We had to come up with a way to make it seem less bad. So what we decided to do was add…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Less bad?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…less bad, add an exclamation point to it, and then it’s…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
To an explosion?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, to the explosion. So it’s, “We’re all going to be OK!” And then there was a lot of bodies but the bodies…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Steel yourself! Someone’s coming!
SEA:
And at this point you realize that the “someone” is standing at the other side of the glade where the trail is, Blat. And he is about three and a half, four feet tall, rather curmudgeonly looking, older, little person. And he says,
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Hmph. There were more of you. OK, let’s go.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um… cahoots.
You’re in cahoots with the minotaur, aren’t you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think I had cahoots as a child. They were a very tasty. I remember them being kind of purple with sprinkles on them. I’m not too sure if I’ve ever made them before I could probably try…
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Yup, I see you were bag-and-tagged.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, we were bagged and tagged, and something has obviously happened to this one’s head.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Sorry about the bag-and-tag.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So could you perhaps tell us why we were bagged and/or tagged and where are we right now?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Well, the first part of that question is pretty easy. Clearly, you didn’t participate willingly. And I’m here to take you to Paradox.
The sounds of the glade fade out.
MIDROLL: RADIO BALGOMA:
A very 1970s-radio-sounding music sting.
RADIO ANNOUNCE:
We interrupt this program with breaking news from Radio Balgomar.
SEAN (AS PERCY)
This is Percy Hugginsworth, live from the scene of the explosion earlier today in the centre of Steadfast, and somebody from the Committee of State has just come on the scene and is giving a statement. We’re joining the statement now live.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, hello everybody. It’s so nice of you to come out and see me. My name’s Eggerton and I like to talk about the news and I come up with ideas for the Committee of State to help them find better ways to tell things to people.
SEAN (AS PERCY)
Excuse me! Excuse me! Sir!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, yes, yes?
SEAN (AS PERCY)
Percy Hollingsworth, with Balgomar Radio. Is there an official position on the explosion that shook the city but a few hours earlier?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We are not aware of any such explosion that may or may not have taken place somewhere around this explosion site.
(aside)
If you could just step aside, sorry, the paramedics are coming through to take away that body.
(aloud again)
We’re still gathering facts and we really don’t want to send anyone into a panic.
SEAN (AS PERCY)
Right. So, what is the official position on the reports that were made about an hour ago by a senior level official of the company who says we are at extreme risk of a second explosion?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
“Extreme risk” is really strong words. I have no evidence to suggest that there absolutely will be a second explosion… and really anything can explode at any time so there’s no reason to think that another explosion would take place here. I mean that’s like saying that, I don’t know, a minotaur travels through time. It’s just not likely.
SEAN (AS PERCY)
And what can people do if they’re feeling worried about this nonexistent explosion?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The best thing to do when you’re feeling worried is to eat fairy cakes. But if you don’t happen to have any, you can go ahead and send positive vibes out into the world. So if for instance you’re listening to a podcast right now, you can leave a very positive review and make sure you subscribe which realistically you probably should have done already.
SEAN (AS PERCY)
And what should people do if they want to help rebuild the damage that’s been done in downtown Steadfast?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s very important to make sure our infrastructure, which was not necessarily damaged by an alleged explosion, stay intact. And if people do want to make sure that Balgomar can continue forward strongly they can support these efforts at patreon.com/AlbaSalix.
SEAN (AS PERCY)
Well there you go everyone. Percy Hugginsworth here and you heard it live. So, we’re going to bring you updated news be sure to tell a friend to tune into Radio Balgomar every two weeks.
Music.
ELI (RADIO ANNOUNCER)
We now return you to our regularly scheduled program already in progress.
APPROACHING PARADO:
SEA:
So, you guys crest the hill and you see the valley that we’ve already described stretching out in front of you, and you see a town in the distance nestled against a cliff that has a massive waterfall coming down right beside the town.
And Blat, this is when it hits you: This town has thatched roofs. You see what appears from this distance to maybe be a marketplace with vendors and stalls… and you see no technology or signs of technology at all. In fact, you probably see fires that are being lit for dinner.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um, my small friend.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Mm hmm.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is it possible once we—
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Wait. Was that for me or your other small friend here?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Small-est friend. Is it possible—
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Now are you speaking about stature or personality?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Kidnapper!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
OK, I’m clear.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is it possible when we get to Paradox that there is a Speechifyer that we could use?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Mmm… Speech… ifyer?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You don’t know what a Speechifyer is, do you?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Mmm, can’t say I’ve ever heard of that one.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Never heard the word before. This is brand new information to you.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Yep. What does it do?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Nothing, it’s not important—we are several centuries in the past.
Heavy silence.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Now was that for me?
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just a general observation. Please continue on.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
When you say several centuries in the past, do you mean like there is some special new park nearby where they have made it several centuries in the past?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
We do have a nice park in town.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well see, there you go! It’s just a nice park.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t think we are in “Old Timeyville”, no. I think this is actually a different era from whence we came.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We came from this era?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, we came from this era in that society advanced to the point that we were from. But no, this is not the era that we were born.
(shouting)
They’re setting fires in the streets!
In the background we begin to hear the sounds of the town.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That happens sometimes, you know where I’m from there’s these explosions that happen every now and then and someone has to file them, I wouldn’t want that job, but every now and then I have to talk about them and make sure that people know everything’s OK even though these explosions keep happening. I’m pretty good at it actually. I think I might get a promotion from Karen and my coworkers…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Karen’s not born yet! I don’t know who Karen is, but she hasn’t been born yet! Karen’s grandmother hasn’t been born yet! There is no Karen! Forget about Karen! There’s excrement everywhere! This isn’t where we’re supposed to be!
Another pause.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
That was for him, right?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, that was for him. I’m sorry, I’m just very upset. I’ve been walking for 17 minutes!
Laughter.
SEA:
So, you guys are into town and you’re getting a fine mist all over you, you’re getting quite damp. And you’re heading through this town. As you get closer it’s even more bizarre, because as you’re walking you start to notice things that can’t happen.
Children laugh and shout in the distance, over the sound of the waterfall.
SEA:
Like, you see children playing. And unlike in Balgomar, where there would be the same laughter, but they’d be playing with a broken-down truck axle, here they’re barefoot and they’re running in the dirt of the road. And there are lights spinning in the air around them, and one of them giggles and lifts up into the air and is flying.
And the houses are thatched roof and made out of stone and there’s not one hard angle or piece of obsidian glass. It is just chaos and the smells are almost overwhelming and the sound of the falls are getting louder and louder.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(to himself)
I miss concrete so much.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shouting)
What?
ADMISSION:
The sound of the falls drops away, then is cut off completely by the closing of a heavy wooden door.
SEA:
Darcy, you come up the main stairs and through a set of doors and they swing closed behind you, and you are in a warm, well-lit hallway that leads forward with inlaid stone. And there’s a T at the end where there’s a giant staircase, and there’s a hallway that leads left and right. And in the hallway that you’re in, there’s a couple of doors on the hallway. And aside from just hearing the reverberation of the door closing behind you, it’s quiet and the roar of the falls is diminished in here.
MARIS:
OK, so I pick out what looks to be the most ornate and closest door to me and I head towards that to open it.
SEA:
OK, so you step up to a door and you see it says ADMISSIONS on it.
MARIS:
Bingo. So, I open the door and go in.
SEA:
OK. You swing open the door and you suddenly realize as you swing open the door and are halfway coming in the room that you’re sort of stepping into one person’s office, right? It’s not like a counter or anything. And you see it’s a large office with inlaid paneling and tasteful paintings. It’s very organized.
And sitting at the desk, and somewhat startled, is a tall woman.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
(a soft, Southern U.S. accent)
Well, bless my stars.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hi, I was… I was brought here by a little guy? A halfling, I think?
SEA:
She’s sort of looking at you, not quite sure about you kind of look and you get a second to take her in. She is tall, thin, wearing black pleather pants with a cream top and a blue and black tightly-woven blazer that sets off her auburn hair and her hazel eyes.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Well, here I was thinkin’ it was just going to be another boring day.
Jankings. Strand Jankings is the name.
SEA:
She steps up and steps forward to shake your hand.
MARIS:
So, I’m a bit taken aback because she’s quite beautiful and charming, and I take that in, and it feels nice to see another woman and I take her hand and say:
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(nervously)
Hi, I’m Darcy … I’m Darcy Kimble.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Please have a seat right here.
SEA:
And she pulls a chair up.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
We need to get you out of them wet clothes. You just wait and I’m just going to grab a towel for a second.
SEA:
And she steps—opens a door off of her office, grabs a towel and comes forward and hands it to you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, thank you…
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Perfect.
SEA:
And you see she has like, five file folders on her desk and she looks through…
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
(to herself)
Darcy, Darcy, Darcy…
SEA:
And she pulls one out, and goes,
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
My, this is a big file you have here, Darcy. You’ve been up to quite a bit, I see.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t understand … why, why do you have a file on me? I don’t come from around here. I don’t know you or this school.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Totally understand. This is a lot to take in, but it’s going to be fine. Please. We’re gonna try and answer all your questions. But there’s a few of you and it would be better if we could just answer them all at once at the briefing. But I’ll try to answer what I can right now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uhh, maybe you could tell me what’s going on. Do you know the minotaur?
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Oh, yes I do. Greg. Yes. Lovely gentleman, one of our best hunters.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(alarmed)
A hunter? He was hunting me?
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Oh, were you bagged and tagged, or did you come through willingly?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There was a thing stuck through my skin, so if you call that willingly, maybe? But yeah, he sent me through some kind of—I don’t even know what it was.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Right. I think it’s a little bit much right now probably to do the admissions paperwork…
SEA:
And she closes the folder.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
…I was being a little presumptuous. I’m sorry. Can I get you a cup of tea?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. Yeah, I think that would be nice. Thank you.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
I’ll ring for some tea and I’ll go pick up right now, I’ll pick up some clothes for you. We’ll get you out of those wet clothes. I think, we’ll just take it one step at a time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Alright… I like, I like chamomile, please. That’s that’s my favorite.
SEA:
She smiles and she rings a bell and then she goes out the door you came in.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
I’ll be right back.
SEA:
And the door closes, and you are in a large gorgeous office with a single very large sort of mahogany desk… Like big enough to fit a Centurion in. A massive desk for this woman.
MARIS:
So, Darcy is still in shock. This is all way too much to take in, but she has enough presence of mind to lean over and grab her file and flip it open to see what it says in there.
SEA:
OK, love it. So, you flip open the file and, um, I’m not sure how Darcy’s going to take it.
You are looking at your kindergarten scores. You see photos of you. You see the centaur, your friend. It’s a lot. And that’s when the door opens behind you.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(high-pitched squawking voice)
Oh! I got the tea!
SEA:
And this, it’s like a demon, but tiny. You’ve never seen anything like it, with glistening red and black skin and a long prehensile tail that’s curled around a cup of tea.
And he comes in…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Who ordered the tea? Snegal has tea.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, sorry!
MARIS:
And I flip the file shut and I turn around.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, I think that’s me. That’s me, I ordered the tea.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Ohh!
SEA:
And he’s just looking at you as his tail slowly lifts the tea up and over towards you.
MARIS:
And I take the tea.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you. What’s, what’s your name again?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal! Snegal give tea!
SEA:
And he scurries back out the door.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, uh… Thank you!
SEA:
And the door swings immediately open again and you hear her saying something.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Oh my, thank you Snegal…
SEA:
And she comes in and she’s got a pile of clothes and she goes:
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
So, you just take these and when we take you by the briefing we’ll get you—
SEA:
And she stops. And she’s just looking at you. And then she looks at the file that’s in a slightly different position. And she looks back to you.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
—I’m going to bring you on up to the briefing room and we’ll stop on the way and get you into some dry clothes. How’s that sound, Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(uncertainly)
Sure.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
We’re going to get your questions answered and we can bring your tea.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you.
MARIS:
And now I’m clutching the book and the tea very closely and following her.
STEADFAST FALL:
ANANKA (VOICE-OVER)
The shattering happens. It has happened, and it will happen. It is always happening.
Time ends.
The river ends.
A low rumbling sound in the background.
SEA:
We’re back in Steadfast, high above the smog. Coming in on a building of concrete and Obsidian that is framed against the setting sun. And there is a figure on top of the roof legs spread leaning forward as if into a great wind. But there is no wind. There is but a wall of black destruction accelerating towards this building.
Distant crashing noises. The rumbling grows louder and louder.
SEA:
The roar can be heard as it chews up buildings as if they are paper. And we see that this figure is a figure we know. It is the minotaur. He clenches his jaws and his fist tightens as he sets his stance firmer, staring down the end—his end—everyone’s end—as it races towards him. But then he flinches.
And he turns fluidly and begins to run, shouting a word at the top of his lungs: “Ananka.”
His hooves pound against the concrete as he races towards the edge of the building, the destruction on his heels. In a futile attempt, he reaches the edge and leaps with one last roar of strength as the blackness closes around and ends everything.
The crashing sounds cut off sharply.
ANANKA (VOICE-OVER)
Did I say time is a river? Time is not a river. This is stupid. River is river.
Time is a lizard.
A lizard which can lose its tail. And slowly, slowly a new one can grow back… if the lizard is lucky.
If the lizard knows a witch named Ananka.
OUTSIDE THE ACADEM:
SEA:
We cut back to outside the Academy of The Fallen in Paradox, near the falls. And we see a rather large half-demon gentleman, still talking to a smaller flightless fairy. And they are still standing in the rain on the path that leads up to the school.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My friend, I assure you, this is not Old Timeyville. We’ a’re not in a theme park. We are in the past. Here’s a test…
SEA:
And they have to be shouting.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouting)
Here’s how I know this!
Long live Boltius!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(reflexively)
Long live Boltius!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, long live Boltius.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, long live Boltius, but there is—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, long live Boltius, but! My point is, no one else here knows who Boltius is, because Boltius isn’t alive.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The emperor isn’t alive?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What did you do to him?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I…! I didn’t do… He hasn’t been born yet! His decend… ancestors! Nothing is…!
There’s no Boltius!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No! Yes, long live Boltius, except Boltius can’t live long because Boltius hasn’t been born yet!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Then how did he win the war?
SEA:
A centaur cloppity-clops past you, and sort of twists his whole torso as he’s going past, like, he’s just watching you guys argue.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Say to him! Say it! Say it to him, he won’t know what you’re talking about!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius, centaur!
SEAN (AS CENTAUR)
(old and befuddled)
What was that, young man?
SEA:
The centaur turns around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
SEAN (AS CENTAUR)
Long… long live your… what?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Boltius!
SEAN (AS CENTAUR)
Long… Well, I hope you have a long life too, young man!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See, he knows!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
He does not know! He obviously doesn’t know!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
He said “Long live”, and I think he said “Boltius” after that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(quiet)
All right. It’s raining and I’m wet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m wet too!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Of course you’re wet too.
Why don’t we just go into whatever this Academy of The Fallen is, and we’ll ask people inside if they know who Boltius is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(resigned)
Yes… long live Boltius.
THE BRIEFIN:
The front door closes and shuts out the sound of the waterfall.
SEA:
We cut to you guys inside the front door, dripping all over the stones as, a woman is coming down the hallway towards you.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Well, we have some more guests I see.
‘Scuse me gentlemen, can I be of any assist—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
(thoughtful)
Yes, long live Boltius.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, she’s just repeating. She doesn’t know…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, she said it! She didn’t even hesitate. She said it, she knows who Boltius is, she wants him to live long because she is a good Balgomarian just like I am. And I think that this proves everything that I’ve been saying.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Madam, do you know of Boltius?
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Oh, yes, I do, of course.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Damn it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know why you keep doubting all of this it seems pretty obvious that this is just a special park that has been set up like Old Timey Town so we can all explore what life was like, as hard as it was, before Boltius—long live Boltius—came along and won the war and made everything better for all of us.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
I’m afraid it’s all in your file, young man. Now, I’m sure you all have a lot of questions. I’m assuming that, by the looks of you, I’m assuming that you are Blat and you must be Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I am Eggerton, and it’s very nice to meet you. Who are you?
Pause.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
That was much shorter than I was expecting based on your file.
So, my name is—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know why you’d say something like that. My file probably isn’t too short. I don’t have a file that I know of but I do have a fairy pouch. My fairy pouch is always full of fairy treats because I spent a lot of time baking…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…and there we go.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Yeah, that makes it very clear. So, first I think we might want to get you dried off so if you’ll come this way with me, I’m gonna take you up to the briefing, so we can get some of these questions answered.
SEA:
She takes you up, stops and grabs two towels and hands them to you, and then brings you to a door on the second floor, opens it and you see the door says BRIEFING ROOM. And she gestures inside.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Gentlemen, if you’ll just have a seat, I believe this might be everyone. We might wait a few minutes to see if anyone else is going to arrive and then I will let Moira know to come on up, that you all are waiting for the briefing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you… and I sincerely hope that this is not a cult.
Laughter.
SEAN (AS JANKINGS)
Well I’m sure we’ll get that answered right away for you, Blat.
SEA:
She gestures that you step into a room. There are about twelve chairs arranged in this room. It’s a comfortable room, and there’s a sort of a dais set up at the at the front of the room and you see that you are not alone in this room.
And you see…
MARIS:
…a slight young woman curled up into one of the chairs. She’s got spiky brown hair that’s unkempt and she’s wearing loose fitting clothes. And she’s flipping through this book and dog-earing pages and sipping tea.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(whispering)
Now, why don’t you try your “Long live Boltius” on her?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(surprised)
Long live Boltius!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See? I don’t know why you keep doing this thing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(heavy sigh)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s pretty obvious to me though that’s where we are is with Boltius because Balgomarians don’t know…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(urgently)
Wait, you know who Boltius is?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re—you’re from Balgomar?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Of course we are, we’re still in Balgomar, we’re just in the Old Timey Park.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh my goodness, thank Loxsyn. Oh my gosh! So, so, so did you get here the same way I did?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Were you in a bag?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. I was…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Then we came in a different fashion.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why… Do you know anything about this? Do you know why you’re here?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, my short friend here thinks that we’re in an old-timey theme park where I assume there’s some sort of a pestilence ride will be going on later.
I feel that perhaps we’ve been brought back to an earlier era.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
We went back through time. That would make sense, cause when I was going through the tunnel it was like I was seeing everything all at once.
Yes! Yes, we must be back in time. That makes sense!
SEA:
And the door opens. A woman steps in, in her late 40s, wearing a white blouse with maroon pinstripes, a loose dark tie and glasses. She does the librarian look really well. Her hair is pulled back in a bun and she walks to the front of the room. She has rather alert eyes. And she says:
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(calm and efficient)
Welcome everyone, and I know you’re going have a lot of questions so if you’ll all just have a seat please, if you’ll just sit down. We’ll try and get through it as quickly as we can.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(distracted)
Yep. I have no idea what that is.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah! You see? Ha! Told you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She’s, she’s, she’s busy… She’s not paying that much attention. She’s probably staying in character.
SEA:
She snaps her fingers at you and says,
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Sit please.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh sorry, I’ll sit down. Do you have a preference where I sit down because I find that I can’t sit—
SEA:
She points to a chair without looking.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
—OK, I’ll sit over there.
SEA:
OK, we’re going to play a game. It’s going to be a slideshow game.
So, I’m going to give the first slide. I have no idea what to say to it, I made it up, I just wrote it down. And then the next slide, one of you is going to give me what the next slide is whenever you think of it or is appropriate.
So, she presses a button and on the screen behind her, literally you see all these like, pixies and little things flying around. All of a sudden something forms, and it says, “The Academy and You.”
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Welcome everyone. This is the Academy of The Fallen, I assume you’ve all put that part together. The Academy has been here for—
(a burst of high-pitched laughter)
—sorry, tens of thousands of years, but for your case let’s just say a long time.
And traditionally we would have around 500 to 600 knights, and you know, a variety of hunters and other roles operating out of this facility. And we are in the business of keeping the balance to reality.
Any questions so far? Good. So, let’s go to the second slide.
SEA:
And she reaches to press a button. And the second slide is…?
MIK:
“The End of Time And You.”
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
So, as you all know the end of time happened, because you experienced it. That is the end of all reality.
So, I’m not sure what each of your experiences were, but I’m afraid that is the point now in the multiverse where everything ends. And for a rather unusual reason you three, and perhaps two others that we’re still attempting to locate, were pulled out into an alternate timeline, as if something in the multiverse was attempting to save your three lives. And it was delaying the inevitable. But even in your time streams it will end. All time ends.
Now the exact time is up to some debate depending on which time stream you’re in. But we’ve unified it to the Unified Event, which is, as you’ll see here, 1:15 P.M. Empire Time, the 23rd day of the 32nd year of Boltius.
(aside)
I put that in. It’s a reference so you could get it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(weakly)
Long live Boltius.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(despondent)
Long live Boltius.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
You are now, as you may have figured out, not at the end of time. So, we have brought you to a different time.
SEA:
And she goes to press a button to bring up the next slide.
CARTE:
And it’s another bit of text: “Welcome to the Past!”
Laughter.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I love this slide. “Welcome to the Past.”
So, really, it’s your futures because you’re still working in linear time. However, you are about seventeen or eighteen generations from where you were a day ago.
MARIS:
And you just hear a teacup smash on the ground as Darcy just drops the tea now.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
So technically, you’re in the past. Uh, so that was important, because if we had left you in your timelines what would have happened…?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Our… deaths?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Very good, Blat! It is Blat, yes? Sorry I’m still getting the files…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, I’m Blat. I’m one of the survivors of the upcoming time apocalypse.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
And my apologies if I missed, on the opening slide: my name is Moira. Yes.
At this point you’re in a place called Farloria. We neighbor with Balgomar, which you know. Balgomar and Farloria are somewhat peaceful kingdoms and in the continent, there are a number of kingdoms. I know that in your future there is just Balgomar everywhere.
OK, good. Let’s move on. Next slide!
MARIS:
It’s text with children playing and such. And it’s “Fun Things To Do While In Farloria”.
SEA:
(laughs)
Love it.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Oh, so here we are. Fun things to do while you’re in Farloria.
So, we have pubs and we have a lot of nature. Oh, and there’s magic! So, because of a variety of things that happened, most magic was removed from your world or your future. However, in this time magic does exist and we use it to do things like this…
SEA:
And she points at the slideshow.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
And things like the running water, and other things that we have in this period.
Next slide!
CARTE:
The next slide is simply an explanation that says: “Yes, The Water Runs By Magic. Neat, Huh?”
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(proudly)
I built this slide myself. I love the transition!
And we’ll get to the final slide, everyone.
SEA:
She presses the button…
MARIS:
And this one says, with sort of a little halfling who looks kind of sad and grumpy, “Fun’s Over, Time To Save The World.”
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Right. So, this is why we’re here.
We need your help.
My sisters and I have a new plan. The last plan didn’t end so well, because… time ended.
So, the purpose of the School of the Fallen is to maintain the balance of reality. And we fight what we call the Shattering. Some call it The Beast. The Shattering’s a more appropriate name.
And in our heyday, we had all the knights that I talked about, running through the school that were working to fight and hold back The Shattering. However, as you now know, it all failed, and the Shattering has won. And The Shattering won’t just stay in that future time. The Shattering will continue to grow that event horizon in all directions and will consume all of reality. So, we have created a breather. A place where we have time to regroup.
Now, not everyone in our organization is on board with this new plan. Some feel like the end has happened. But we believe very strongly, and we will show you how there is a way to stop The Shattering. But we need you three. It’s critical. There is some reason that you were held back from the event. Some agency has moved, and we’re still putting all the pieces together. But we are here to help you and to nurture you and to work together to hold The Shattering back.
SEA:
And she presses the button and it says: “The End.”
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Well, it’s my first time doing that presentation. Thank you all very much. Now, are there any last questions?
MARIS:
So, Darcy’s brain about three minutes ago said, “You can stay here but I’m leaving.” And then just closed the door. And so she’s just humming, quietly, the Balgomarian anthem.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(hums a stirring march)
MIK:
Eggerton hears this and stands up and puts a hand over his heart and begins to sing along.
SEA:
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(horribly off-key singing)
O Boltius, you are great and wise
And we thank you for being our Emperor
And… other things—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(a final, lengthy scream)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa—
CARTE:
—and then Blat just passes out.
Laughter.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Well. I think that went pretty well, actually.

…Was it an eagle hawk?
Laughter.
SEA:
Why can’t I figure it out now? I don’t know where I’m at. I was like, can an eagle…? I guess an eagle can be female. OK—
MARIS:
Of course they can! Where do baby eagles come from?!

I don’t know!

I love how, “My lack of sleep will not affect my performance at all. Are there such a thing as female eagles? Is that a thing?”

"End Notes, Episode 2","Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCER (ELI)
The End of Time and Other Bothers: End Notes. Episode 2.
SEA:
Hello everyone! Welcome to End Notes, Session 2. This End Notes is going to be a little bit different than the other ones, and we’re going to explain why as we get into it. For this End Notes session I’m joined with co-show creator and Alba Salix wizard extraordinaire, Eli McIlveen.
EL:
(laughs)
Hello!
SEA:
So the whole idea of these End Notes is that we’re going to talk about the episode that just happened, and generally what’s going to happen is we do that at the table, so we record a session using our improvisation and role-playing, and then…
EL:
No one is allowed snacks until they give their notes!
SEA:
(laughs)
Yeah. And then—we used to allow everyone to go down to snacks, now no. So we end recording, we then start out—everyone has little green pads that they write down their questions on about that episode, and then we discuss those with everyone at the table. So you get to hear from the people playing Darcy and Eggerton and…
EL:
Blat.
SEA:
Blat, thank you—what was going on in their heads. They can ask me, what was planned? How did that go? We can just talk about it.
EL:
Because there are always questions!
SEA:
(laughs)
There are.
EL:
With Sean DM-ing.
SEA:
Sometimes some really crazy ones.
So there was—I just wrote down, “WTF happened to Episode 2?”
Episode 2 that you just listened to is not the full Episode 2. One of the challenges when we started this venture was me trying to figure out, how long is a session?
EL:
Yeah, because we’ve done gaming sessions that have gone on for an entire day, really.
SEA:
Thirteen hours, yeah.
EL:
(laughs)
Not recorded.
SEA:
And here we’re really focusing on the improv, so we’re trying to keep it in small spurts for the improvvers at the table. So we do shorter sessions, take a break.
But one of the challenges we had going in is that sometimes it’s harder to tell with improvvers how long a simple three sentences is going to take.
EL:
Yeah. Or a simple “walking down to a school from the top of a hill”.
SEA:
Right. Case in point.
So I had seven sentences written for Episode 2 and we got through three of them in the episode you just listened to.
EL:
(laughs)
SEA:
So the Episode 2 that we recorded at the table became Episode 2 and Episode 3. And that created some structural issues where I’m not sure if Episode 2 is going to be our strongest episode ever. Hopefully you guys enjoyed it. Wait until you hear Episode 3… and 4 and 5 are my absolute favourites so far.
That said, we had to split Episode 2 into Episode 2 and 3. So we have an awesome End Notes session with all the cast, and they are going to talk about the Episode 2 that you just heard and the Episode 3 that you’re going to hear.
EL:
Mostly about Episode 3.
SEA:
Mostly about Episode 3. In a week and a half, you guys will be hearing that. So that’s still coming. What we wanted to do because we split them, is we thought, hey, this is a chance for Eli and I to sit down—to say it in a long way—and just talk about some things that happened and what we’re learning in the post process of building this show.
So that’s what happened and why it’s now just us in this Episode 2.
So what did you want to talk about, Eli?
EL:
So yeah. I wanted to talk a bit about the process of creating this show. Because you had fallen in love with actual play podcasts, and kind of jumped at the idea of creating one; I was keen to do something more in the Alba world, and we had to kind of meet in the middle and figure out what that means.
SEA:
Yep.
EL:
We’ve talked a little bit—you talked a little bit in Episode 0 about what it means to be working in this world that has established “canon”, quote unquote.
SEA:
It actually was a real challenge for us for a number of reasons. One, because Eli went insane creating background…
(laughs)
EL:
Yeah. Never having DM-ed before, I’m like, “I will just make up loads of stuff about this city and—”
SEA:
I have stuff on the fauna and the breakdown of lives and plants and history…
EL:
I’m like, “Here are some details you might want to just toss in. I dunno! I dunno what you need!” I mean, your descriptions and things—usually you’ve just got a file card with some bullet points on, “This character looks like this, and this is what they want, in a word.” And the same thing for like, locations and stuff now.
SEA:
No, locations are a little more detailed.
EL:
Oh, OK.
SEA:
But yeah. So Eli had all this information. It was a little daunting GM-ing the first episode. It was hard for me to get my head wrapped around, how much detail, what am I reading versus going off—because I’m more a go-off-my-gut kind of guy.
EL:
Yeah.
SEA:
But the challenge was not the amount of data that was created. The challenge was, we didn’t want to build a story—we wanted to create an audio drama. And we wanted it to truly be story—not just story-first, we wanted it to be story. Full stop. Just story.
EL:
Yeah. There is a game mechanic underlying it, but we don’t really touch on it that much in the first arc, really.
SEA:
Yeah. You will see it a little more.
EL:
There’s a few test rolls… but yeah.
SEA:
A roleplaying mechanic is fun. A lot of us love roleplaying. A roleplaying mechanic is not necessarily good—well, let’s just put the cards on the table. Roleplaying mechanics are not good at telling stories. They are there to provide guidelines for a shared experience, and I think it’s been sort of well proven now that just setting up a microphone in a room will not create this amazing story, generally.
So one of the things I wanted to play with that we were trying to work out into this idea in the Alba world was improvisation-first. So improv is a powerful technique for a group of people to create a story together where nobody knows where it’s going.
EL:
(laughs)
Sean has fallen into the cult of improv in the last two months.
SEA:
I have.
EL:
It’s an incredible…
SEA:
So the challenge is actually, how do you allow a group of players to truly make offers to each other in improv without someone having to step in and shut them down?
EL:
Yeah. I didn’t want to be standing in the corner with the clipboard going, “Oh, no no, you can’t do that.”
SEA:
Right. But that meant we did have to navigate some things. Because Eli did get very upset at some early meetings when certain things were brought up, which we don’t have to get into. But we did have to navigate, what is allowed in this world? What are the rules? What are the boundaries? What can the players create on the fly?
You’re going to hear—I won’t give it away—there’s a pretty awesome moment coming with something that does not necessarily really fit in the Alba world. One of the players just went there. He pimped me; I gave him pimping power—
EL:
What does that mean?
SEA:
So it’s sort of a joke. In improv it’s called “pimping” when you sort of like, you’re giving things to another player that you know they have to accept.
EL:
You’re loading them down with, “OK, I bet you can’t play this!”
SEA:
Yeah, but it’s sort of—in a scene it would be sort of done more like, “Oh… you know, I love how your fingernails are all seven inches long and oh, your creepy eyes, so beautiful when it leaks—” I’m just giving whatever, but you’re giving things to a player that then they’re going to come back to you with, that they’re going to play off of.
And so sometimes I make a mistake—but it’s fun—of giving some pretty explicit pimping power to some people, and doing that with Blat, Carter Siddall, is dangerous, because he’ll go somewhere. He’ll use it. So, I don’t know if that makes any sense, but you’ll hear that soon.
So allowing for that kind of thing to happen was hard when we’re saying, we’re putting this in the Alba world. So they are back now in a time when Alba is alive. Like, we are just at the other side of the country, and there’s the opportunity for these stories to touch or cross. And we’re introducing—so anyways. So that was sort of—and it wasn’t just me. Eli had to—you had to come up with some ways to allow for rather bizarre things to be happening.
EL:
Yeah. And in the end I decided not to be so worried about canon. That was the big lesson in this, is that I don’t want the canon in Alba to be this cut-and-dried, ooh, we’re going to go through the technical manual every time something happens and yea or nay it based on how it “fits”. If it’s cool—it’s that, I think on TVTropes they call it the Rule of Cool: if it’s cool, then it goes. And I think that fits with your style of Game Mastering.
SEA:
But I think you—like, I want to get more specific—you actually created a city called Paradox specifically with certain attributes, that really allows for things there to be a little different.
EL:
Yeah. It is a very magical place. Like, this is possibly the most magical place on the continent, maybe the entire planet that Alba is living on.
SEA:
Yeah. And there’s crossroads and this whole parts to Paradox that we’re not going to talk about here because it’s super cool, that you’ve sort of built into Paradox.
EL:
Yeah. There’s the foundations laid for future adventures, either in this story or another.
SEA:
Right. So anyway, so that was sort of the challenge, I think, was a lot of time, us spending, figuring out, how do we get an environment where improvisation can be a really strong force and still allow roleplay and still allow the Alba universe to exist and one day—I’m saying it now—have a potential crossover with an Alba character.
EL:
Oh yeah. We so want that to happen.
SEA:
So Episode 2 is really just about getting them back into Farloria. They’re a little shellshocked. And again, we only got it through Point 3, which is my fault. But there’s really no way to get improvvers any faster. Like, they had a lot of stuff to build and create for themselves that starts to pay off in Episode 3. So that was really cool.
EL:
(laughs)
Oh, the “Long live Boltius” just killed me.
SEA:
Yeah, it was really great.
So one of the things I want to talk about was this idea that we’ve realized that we can’t have one bar for all the Alba shows. We’ve been having to wrestle with, what is the musical approach and the sound design for this show, where we could put it out every two weeks?
EL:
Yeah. We’re not going to be able to make it as detailed, and foley every single little footstep and action that the characters take.
SEA:
Says the guy who’s been up until 5 AM every night, trying to make it as detailed as possible.
EL:
(exhales)
Yeah.
SEA:
But we sort of had to have a moment where we had to say—you know, a lot of people are like, why can’t you put out more Alba Salix? And one of the reasons is that it’s an insane amount of work per episode. Not just to pre-produce and write and record and all that. But the post-production on Alba… one day I want to add up the hours. But it is weeks of Eli not sleeping, if not 5 or 6 weeks per episode. It is an immense amount of effort. And so the idea here was to create a show where we could put it out every two weeks, right? But that’s going to require us to spend less than two weeks an episode, like closer to a week.
And so I just wanted you to talk about some of the give and take, and how you’re approaching that. Because you’re still trying to create a pretty interesting sounding, distinct in the Alba universe, world. So what are you giving on?
EL:
Yeah. I mean, we want to bring it to life, but obviously we can’t give it quite the amount of detail and attention that we do for our scripted shows. Yeah, churning out about an hour of audio every two weeks, we’re going to be doing things like, there will be ambient sound, there’s going to be a music cue here and there where it kind of lifts the scene, and likewise, that’s how we’re going to be treating sound effects too. Like, if there’s a particular line or moment that the characters set up that a sound effect could really help sell, then we’ll put it in.
So the big example was Episode 1, with the explosion. Sean was listening back to it and going, “No, no, make the explosion bigger! Make the explosion bigger!” And not just louder, but longer. Make it complete chaos. So yeah.
SEA:
But—I gotta call you out here. Because that all sounds great. “Oh, we’re just going to do it where needed.” But I have caught you not sleeping now, and falling behind because you’re trying to hit a bar that you had set for Alba with this new show.
EL:
Yeah.
SEA:
So tell us about… what’s that like? What’s it like to be the sound designer on a show and having to use footsteps at the opening of Episode 1 were driving you insane. Probably still are. They’re not the right footsteps. And the old Eli would have been out getting grass, putting it in our basement, doing some crazy things to create a sound. So how are you—like how, emotionally, do you deal with the fact that this show can’t be the same?
EL:
Yeah, we had a big heart-to-heart at about 11:00, you were going to bed, and we just had to have this talk about, how detailed is this? And am I going to have to sort of “let go” and “compromise” and all of this stuff.
(laughing)
And you kind of talked me off a few ledges this show.
SEA:
Eli wasn’t going to allow—I don’t know if anybody knows—in Alba, no music is reused. I think some people don’t even realize. All the little stings, every episode the stings are different! The music has been modified.
EL:
Well, the stings I reuse from episode to episode, but never twice in the same episode.
SEA:
(laughs)
EL:
That’s why there’s about 20 of them.
SEA:
Right. So yeah. It’s been interesting to see you try and create something really interesting, but it’s weird, because I want great sound too. Like, there’s places where I’m like, I want more! But I think it’s just something we all have to deal with when we’re trying to put out a show more frequently: Where do we let go? Where do we focus?
EL:
Yeah. And we don’t have a team to lean on for the production stuff.
SEA:
Well, I think that’s a lot. We’ve covered a lot today. Thank you, Eli, thank you for joining me here today.
So again, we created this End Notes because, again, we split Episode 2 into two, so you listened to the first half of what I had planned as Episode 2. It is now the Episode 2. I can’t wait for you all to hear Episode 3; it’s awesome. And Episode 4 and 5, again, they’re our favourites right now.
So that’s going to be it for today. And moving forward, the End Notes are going to be a benefit for our Patreon sponsors. So if you want to learn more about that and how to get access to End Notes and early access to episodes and deleted scenes and all that cool stuff, you can visit patreon.com/albasalix.
And regardless, we will see you in about a week and a half or so, with Episode 3.
EL:
Woo!
Theme music plays."
"3: The Academy of the Fallen, Part 2","LAST TIME…
Fast-paced music.
ANNOUNCE:
Last time on The End of Time and Other Bothers…
A noisy explosion.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
“Welcome to the Past.”
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(calls)
Hello? Mr. Minotaur?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
So, as you all know the end of time happened, because you experienced it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Lousy minotaur! Take some of this!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ow!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re taking me to the Academy of The Fallen?
SEA:
You flip open the file… You are looking at your kindergarten scores. You see photos of you.
MARIS:
So, Darcy’s brain about three minutes ago said, “You can stay here but I’m leaving.”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
The stone of Fae…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Most magic was removed from your world or your future. However, in this time magic does exist.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re—you’re from Balgomar?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Of course we are, we’re still in Balgomar, we’re just in the Old Timey Park.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There’s no Boltius!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Long live Boltius!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No! Yes, long live Boltius, except Boltius hasn’t been born yet!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Traditionally we would have 500 to 600 knights, working to fight and hold back The Shattering. However, it all failed.
We need you three.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(a rapid-fire montage of his various screams)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa…
CARTE:
…and then Blat just passes out.
Laughter.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Well. I think that went pretty well, actually.
MARIS:
“Fun’s Over, Time To Save The World.”
GOOD NIGH:
SEA:
We enter the Academy of the Fallen, gliding down empty corridors worn smooth by many feet. We work our way up the stairwell to the second floor, where we hear a murmuring of voices coming from behind a door labeled BRIEFING ROOM.
Inside, we see Strand Jankings taking Blat, Eggerton and Darcy through a series of endless paperwork. They are in shock as they fill out form after form.
A few minutes later, she opens the door and leads the three of them out, each hefting their issued clothing and following dutifully behind her. She leads them up the stairs and down the hall to the dormitories.
One of the dormitory doors is open, and inside is a large room filled with beds and cots stacked on top of each other. Five of the beds have been made. The rest are empty.
The room feels stale and cold. But there is a window looking out at the night and the roar of the waterfall can be heard in the distance.
(to the players)
So, you’re standing in a dormitory holding some clothes.
(to Marisa)
You’re holding a book.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(forlorn)
That suit cost me a week’s salary. Now I’m wearing what appears to be pyjamas, that in no way is keeping my wings in check.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(despondent)
I don’t have a home.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All that furniture I bought… It’s now at some future point, frozen in time… or perhaps doesn’t exist at all.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(cheerful)
You guys see how pretty it is outside, though?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t understand how you can be so positive. Did you hear anything she said? The world is ceasing to exist.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, she said the world did cease to exist, but then we came back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But do you believe all that stuff? Do you think we’re supposed to, what, save the world?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’ve got my fairy cakes. That helps.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You know… I could actually use a fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You want a fairy cake?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, please.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why don’t you start with a half? They’re pretty strong.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. OK. Thank you. Thank you.
MARIS:
I start munching on the fairy cake.
SEA:
Awesome. So, this is our first use of a move.
So, fairy cakes actually have a move associated with them. And you had some damage at one point…
MARIS:
Mmm hmm. I had 1 damage.
MIK:
When I feed someone one of my fairy cakes, sweets or nom-noms, I roll +Wisdom, and on a plus 10, I heal for… OK, I’ll do this first…
He rolls.
SEA:
On a 10-plus.
MARIS:
Oooh, there it is.
SEA:
Plus Wisdom…
MIK:
Plus Wisdom, so that’s 10.
SEA:
OK, so you heal…
MIK:
I heal for d8 + Wisdom… So that’s 6 + 1.
MARIS:
I only needed 1.
SEA:
So, Darcy is at max. This… this cake was amazing.
So that move—you just have to read what happens if you had rolled a 7 to 9.
MIK:
“It comes with a cost. They are either drunken, blind, tripping, etc.”
MARIS:
That would have been fun.
SEA:
You’re still healed. OK.
Eating this cake—like, give us that. It’s a really powerful experience.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(breathless with amazement)
W… wow. I’ve never actually had a fairy cake. This is… This is really good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why, thank you!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, you’re… do you make them yourself?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I do. And I infuse all of them with a little bit of love.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sincerely)
I can feel that.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m glad.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Let’s hug it out.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(softly)
OK. There it is.
MARIS:
And I sort of cling to him a little longer than maybe is comfortable.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, OK. OK, that’s, that’s… OK…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, thanks.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. Good stuff.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If you’ll excuse me, I’ll be vomiting in the corner in sheer terror.
(off mic)
Bleaargh!
SEA:
(laughs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…I’m going to sleep on this side of the room.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is that a bit of a sandwich? Where’d you get that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(exhales)
About 1500 years from now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, you know what, I just think… we just need to sleep on this, right? Because this is, this is a lot of information to take in, and uh, I’m hoping that when we wake up in the morning, none of this will have happened! And we’ll have never met each other…
(breaking down)
and I can just go back to ladling Impescor Zesty Golden soup to people who couldn’t care less about me. OK?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It seems that the fairy cakes may have taken her down a dark path.
SEA:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So, just to sum up: you give presentations of some kind, and you, my good lady, ladle cheap foodstuffs out to people.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I do.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I worked in a filing room.
Thank heavens we three have been chosen to be the saviours of the entire multiverse.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, Loxsyn preserve us.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If we go to sleep now, we’ll be about ten hours closer to the future event in which all reality ceases to exist.
Well, good night!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Good night.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Good night.

ANNOUNCE:
The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy roleplaying game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your Game Master is Sean Howard, with players Michael Howie, Marisa King and Carter Siddall.
Episode 3: The Academy of The Fallen, Part 2.
BREAKFAS:
SEA:
So, morning is coming up and the dining room is on the first level, back where you guys went to Admissions, when you first came in the building.
And it’s basically a cafeteria setup. So, there’s a big wall at the end with a grate that’s down, and you see this imp, this little imp, running around, trying to jump up and push the grate up. And he’s just jumping up at the grate…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(a shrill, Muppet-like squawk)
Oh! Oh! Can’t reach!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe you should go help your little friend.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll go help my little friend.
CARTE:
So, I walk up to the imp and I ask,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is there anything that you require in any way?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes, yes, yes, please! Trying to serve! Won’t open!
CARTE:
So, I reach up and I open it all the way up.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, thank you.
(turns and gasps in realization)
Oh, Your Evilship! I bow before you! I am not worthy!
SEA:
And he’s like literally clinging to your feet.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The fact that you were unable to raise the grate is none of my concern, but thank you—do you have any hot pockets in this era?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(frantic)
I am but scum beneath your boots, Your Evilship! I am your faithful servant!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I admit, you do come from an earlier time, and perhaps your education is not quite up to snuff to my era. But that does not mean that you are the scum beneath my feet—please, do you have any toast? Any potatoes, at all?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Toast… Yes, Your Evilship! I have toast! Yes!
SEA:
And he runs all the way around, and you see him hop up onto a bench, then hop down and like, push it on wheels, over, and then hop back up and grab some toast, and then hop down. He’s right there but he runs all the way around the door and comes and holds it out on open hands for you.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Your Evilship! Smegal brings you toast!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…A plate would be nice.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, yes!
SEA:
And he runs back, and—do you take the toast?
CARTE:
No. No. He’ll take it back…
SEA:
So he runs back with the toast, runs around pushes the chair holding the toast in his mouth, climbs up, grabs a plate, puts the toast on the plate, climbs back down, comes running out of breath—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, Smegal sorry sir! Toast on plate! Your Evilship.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Perhaps now… a plate with toast that hasn’t been in your mouth. I don’t know how you usually do it here… Do you have any of this—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, yes! Snegal fix!
SEA:
And he takes his hands and rips off the piece that was in his mouth, and holds the plate back up for you.
CARTE:
I take the plate and smile politely, then turn immediately around and walk towards one of the tables to sit down to eat.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, I hope he’s happy…
SEA:
And he runs back around and climbs up on his thing and is looking… He’s waiting to serve somebody.
MIK:
I walk over and say,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello there. Do you have any Impescor Original?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Hello?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Hellllooo?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m right here.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Down. Down. You have… You’re up high. Look down.
SEA:
He leans forward.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Yes. Oh, what can I cook, what can Snegal get you?
SEA:
(aside, still in Snegal’s voice)
See, it’s Snegal, not Smeagol! I fixed it!
Laughter.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
What can Snegal get you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Could I get an Impresco, plain please?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes!
SEA:
And he runs, slides the thing over, gets another piece of toast, waits, slides it over, puts it on a plate, leans over and then just drops it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(surprised, scrambling)
Oh! that’s all—no, I got it. We’re good. We’re OK.
Um, this this toast I’ll enjoy the toast. I’ve not had toast in a long time. I don’t think I’ve ever had toast. But do you perhaps have any Impresco? You know I’ll take Zesty—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Another one? Another Impresco?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. This this is not Impresco. This is toast.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Nnnno it’s not.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(stunned silence)
I believe that this is in fact bread that has been heated.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
No it’s not.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(silence)
OK. Well, thank you very much for the Impresco, it’s very kind of you and I look forward to sampling it. I’m going… I’m going to go sit with my friend and eat it.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Wait. Is he your friend?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well we’ve not known each other too long but I like to think we’re—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Wait! Wait!
SEA:
He scoops some oatmeal, and he grabs some fruit, and he puts it on a plate, leans over and drops it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(scrambling)
Oh, I got that one too! You’re quick, but I’m pretty quick too.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, you tell His Evilship, Snegal is friend too!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. OK. I don’t think he’s all that evil, I think he’s maybe just a little cranky, not much of a morning person. He was mumbling something about files and a furnace in his sleep. But I’m sure that he wants to be your friend too. He does seem very, very kind. His name is Blat, by the way. Blat.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(practicing, softly)
Blat. Blat…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, yes Blat. Blat, just like that. Blat.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blat, Blat Blat Blat…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But only one at a time. Just… just the one.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blat, Blat, Blat…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. I’m going to go eat this now, thank you!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Buh, buh, Blat… Blaaaaat…
MARIS:
And at this point I appear in the doorway looking like gloom personified.
So my normal spiky hair has drooped. I slept in my cadet clothes that I was given yesterday, so they’re all rumpled and everything. And my shoulders are all hunched. I just say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(fragile)
The world has still ended.
Do you have any Snappies?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Snappies?
SEA:
He take some toast and snaps it.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snappies!
SEA:
And it goes to give it to you and goes,
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(suddenly anxious)
Oh. Blat. Blat Blat.
SEA:
And it runs and gets a plate, puts it on the plate and then gets back up on it. It’s like climbing up and off of this little ladder, and it gets on this ladder and it pushes it over to you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no, This is toast crumbs. This is not Snappies.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes, it is.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Snappies are this wafer-like thing where when you add water they pop and crackle, and they expand… This is toast.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
No, it’s not.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, it is.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
It’s a snappy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(defeated)
OK.
MARIS:
And I just take it and I shuffle over to the table where the others are and I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
They don’t have Snappies.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, but here, you can have my toast.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I have toast.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Not like mine you don’t.
THE END OF TIM:
Soft wind chimes.
ANANK:
I see our old friend on the roof at the end of time. The Hunter to some. Greg the Minotaur to others.
My Grishka.
I watched him stare down his end, the end of us all. But unlike us he chose to face it alone.
When my Grishka ran, I broke. The river floods and changes course: cities underwater; death walks the land. I risk everything.
Perhaps we are doomed.
Perhaps I am too weak.
MIDROLL: SNEGAL WANTS A TRAILE:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning… of the middle… of the End! Of Time! and Other Bothers!
MIK:
Hi, I’m Michael Howie. We want to thank you for taking the time to listen to The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Snegal want to thank you too!
MIK:
Yeah and if you can, please review our show on iTunes.
(laughs)
…if you liked it that is, I mean—don’t leave a review if you didn’t like it.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Some people don’t like Snegal?
MIK:
No, I’m sure it’s not you, Snegal. It’s probably Carter.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal likes everyone, Michael!
MIK:
Now folks, feel free to share episodes with your friends and spread the word with the hashtag #OtherBothers.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal likes hashtags! Snegal cooks them with rice, and gravy, and Snappies!

SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
C… P… X…
MIK:
(off mic)
Hey Eli, why couldn’t I record this spot with Marisa or Carter? Were they busy today or something?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal very popular! Snegal has agent. Do you have agent, Michael?
MIK:
Uh, no I don’t. But speaking of agents, have you ever read Lord of the Rings? Maybe seen the movie?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Mmm… No.
MIK:
What about The Hobbit? There’s just, there’s something about you that feels pretty familiar to me.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Maybe?
MIK:
All I’m saying is, your name is one letter off from being a major Tolkien character.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal was in the movies?
MIK:
(facepalms audibly)
Well, no, not you particularly, Snegal, but someone an awful lot like you and it feels like someone may have taken some shortcuts, and I’m a little worried that you’re going to set a bad precedent for the show…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Would Snegal get my own trailer? I want a trailer, Michael!
MIK:
We’ll have to put that into the budget maybe for Season 2, but people if they support Patreon maybe we can set that as one of the goals.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
P… X… C…
MIK:
(leaving)
All right, I’m done for the day. No, I’m going to my trailer…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
A…Y…
Music sting.
AFTER THE EN:
A light breeze stirs the wind chimes.
ANANK:
(softly)
My Grishka, wake up. Wake up, please. Greg?
SEAN (AS GREG)
Where… ohh, where…?
ANANK:
Thank goodness… You’re alive. You’re safe.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Ananka?
ANANK:
Yes, it is me.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Am I dreaming?
ANANK:
Grishka, no. You are alive. You are safe in my hut.
SEAN (AS GREG)
(breathing heavily)
The last thing I remember is running like… prey.
ANANK:
You were prey. You were the prey, Grishka. It is what they wanted. It was what they wanted me to do—to let it happen.
But I could not let it happen. Not to you.
SEAN (AS GREG)
But the plan. Ananka… At what cost?
ANANK:
I don’t know. I don’t know, my Grishka, what cost. I just know that… this cannot happen. It cannot.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Ananka, what have you done?
No, don’t answer. Take my hands. It is done. We will find a way.
ANANK:
I know we will. We will make it happen, together.
SEAN (AS GREG)
But first we need to find me some pants.
ANANK:
Grishka… where we are going, we don’t need pants.
THE ASSESSMEN:
SEA:
We’re back in The Academy of The Fallen, and we’re moving down the main corridor heading towards the cafeteria. But we’re moving quite slowly, almost like we’re shuffling.
And that’s because we’re following Cyrus the halfling. A grumbling man just shy of four feet tall, with a pipe in the corner of his mouth. And he’s barefoot and his slacks drag a little on the ground as he shambles forward.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Cyrus do this, Cyrus do that. Always another errand for Cyrus.
He opens the door.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
(clears throat)
If you will lend me your attention, it’s time for your assessment.
(failing to summon any enthusiasm)
Go, go, go. Go-o‑o heroes.
If you’ll just come this way please.
Their footsteps echo along the corridors.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I assume this is our physical assessment to see if we are healthy enough to eventually be killed in some horrible manner?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I ladle soup for a living.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What flavours of soup?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Original. Zesty. Party flavour. And Golden.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I never really like having Zesty in the morning.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s fair.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Original tends has to be my go-to. But that—
SEAN (AS MAN)
(nervous and fussy)
Excuse me! If you’ll just get your seats. Thank you.
SEA:
There’s three seats. It’s a giant room and it is sort of like an opal colour, but the walls have an iridescent hue to them.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Very pretty.
SEA:
And there’s just three seats. And you see a man in a lab coat who is holding a clipboard.
SEAN (AS MAN)
Right, right. Sit down. Everyone just have a seat. We’ll get started right away.
MARIS:
I slouch into my seat.
CARTE:
I slide into mine.
MIK:
I sit down into mine comfortably and take out my notebook.
SEAN (AS MAN)
I am super excited because this is my first assessment. Whew! I’m sure it’s going to go fine. I’ve had a few hundred years to prepare.
So, what’s going to happen is, you’re going to be going through a series of, let’s say experiments, and they’re going to assess your abilities—your innate talent and your strengths.
(looking to them for approval)
Huh?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(deadpan)
Excellent.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you experimenting on us?
SEAN (AS MAN)
Well! Not quite the response I was expecting but yes, we’ll carry on!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I have a question.
SEAN (AS MAN)
Uh… Yes. OK?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What was your name?
SEAN (AS MAN)
Zieffe.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you, Zieffe.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
You’re welcome.
Now, uh… yes, we will be experimenting on you. You signed a waiver and a disclaimer yesterday.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I wasn’t told I was signing anything like that.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
It was in the admissions packet. I have it right here—
SEA:
He holds it up.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
—if you’d like to review your signature.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s fine. It’s fine.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
OK. So how this is going to work is each one of you is going to one at a time just enter the machine and, uh, you are going to be assessed… and then you will come back out and have a seat while the other two get assessed.
It’s very straightforward. And then we’ll get your results, and we’ll get you right into class.
So! Who’s first?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(without hesitation)
The fairy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I… Uh…
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Very good. Good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Come forward.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right, thank you.
EGGERTON’S ASSESSMEN:
SEA:
So Eggerton stands up, steps forward and literally a wall just drops down right behind them.
A mechanical clatter and a thump.
SEAN (CONT’D)
And you’re in a much smaller room now, the two of you. And Eggerton you hear a voice. It’s Zieffe and is sort of echoing off the walls.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
(Shouting)
OK, just give me a second, Egg—it’s Eggerton, right?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That is correct, sir.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Right.
SEA:
The room lights up and you are in a royal cathedral. And light is coming down out of one point way, way up and coming right down on a stone that has a sword coming out of it.
A little fanfare. Marisa sings operatically.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Neat!
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
OK, so your first test is ready! You just need to draw the sword.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK!
MIK:
So, I take out my notebook and I sit down cross-legged with one of my pencils…
Laughter.
MIK:
…hold up my hands to try and get some perspective measurements, and start sketching.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…and you know, I was never very good at drawing, but I thought that it was something I should probably practice anyway, and you’ll see sometimes in my notebooks if you go through the little sketches of things, mostly it’s the buildings—
SEA:
Outside you hear a BZZZZT!
A buzzer sounds.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Well, that’s OK, it’s OK. There’s a lot of tests, don’t worry. Stay in there, Eggerton!
The walls shift again.
SEA:
And suddenly the room changes, and you are on a ledge against a wall. You can feel the wall behind you. And 40 feet away on the far side of the room is another platform, and you see Zieffe standing there and he waves at you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hi Zieffe!
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Hey Eggerton!
SEA:
In between you is basically roiling magma.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Be careful Eggerton, don’t lose your footing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK.
SEA:
And he’s messing around with a contraption and it looks like sort of a cannon. And he presses a lever on it and steps back and he goes,
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
OK, so we’re going to start at one per second…
SEA:
And suddenly the cannon fires an arrow straight at you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh oh.
MIK:
Well, I duck.
SEA:
OK, so you duck down, it like, pings off the wall above you but you almost lose your balance when you duck, because it’s a pretty narrow ledge you’re on and it falls down and suddenly it’s firing another arrow.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I have a question!
Laughter.
SEA:
OK, The arrow strikes you in the leg.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OW!
Laughter.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Well, that’s not good. It’s going up to 3 per second!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why? Why, why is this a thing?
SEA:
And now the thing is starting to rotate left and right, and it’s going chuk, chuk, chuk!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I have a question!
SEA:
Another arrow strikes you in the shoulder.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OW!
Why? Why are you doing this?
SEA:
You do manage to dodge a bunch of them. Even with one on your shoulder and one in your leg you’re doing not bad, dodging while they’re firing.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
OK, you’re doing not bad, Eggerton! We’re going to go up to 5 per second!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why would you do more?!
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Try not to get hit!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t want to get hit! It hurts when I get hit!
SEA:
So he puts it up to full, and it’s like chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk!
You guys outside hear a…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(blood-curdling cry)
SEA:
And then you hear: BZZZT.
OK, the room goes dark.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Sorry about that, Eggerton! You know see if you can… well, maybe leave the one in your shoulder, but you might break off the one on your leg…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(weakly)
OK…
SEA:
You’re down 5 hit points.
MARIS:
(laughing)
Geez.
MIK:
Shocker.
The walls shift.
SEA:
OK. So the lights come back up and you’re sitting in a classroom, in one of those uncomfortable little wooden chairs with the little—
MIK:
Uncomfortable from the arrow shafts.
SEA:
Extra uncomfortable from the arrow shafts.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
So, you have 60 seconds before the candle burns down and ignites the oil.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Which candle would that be?
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Oh, oh sorry!
SEA:
And you hear a lever get thrown, and all of a sudden oil starts pouring out across the floor down towards you, seeping down towards you, and a candle appears in the centre of the floor and is slowly burning down. Rather rapid for a candle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t think you have our best interests at heart right now, sir.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Your time has started! Focus on your test!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh… OK.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Question number one—
MIK:
I get up and I walk over and extinguish the candle.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
Your just hand goes through it but it burns you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh that’s… Why?
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
You’re losing time!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, OK, OK.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Griffin is to eagle as the Golden Kyaromont is to…
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(thinks)
Raptor.
SEA:
Bing!
A bell sounds.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
The substance most accepting of transmutation is: A) lead, B) iron, C) copper, D) gold.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Gold.
SEA:
Bing!
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
What is the boiling point of an egg in pyrometres?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We never learned metric, darn it!
SEA:
Bzzzt!
And the candle stops.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Hey, I think we found your thing here, Eggerton! That was pretty good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Could I have a bandage, please?
The wall mechanism slides open.
SEA:
Blat and Darcy, Eggerton suddenly appears in front of you. Describe what they see, Eggerton.
MIK:
I have an arrow through my shoulder. I have a broken arrow in my leg and I have another one in my stomach.
But I’m still smiling.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sweet Loxsyn! What happened to you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I, I—
SEA:
Zieffe is suddenly there.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Ut! No cheating! OK, who’s next?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The demon told me he wants to go next.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What? Hey!
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Yes, perfect!
The wall slams down.
BLAT’S ASSESSMEN:
SEA:
Boom! Darcy, you are now sitting alone, as Eggerton crawls out the door past you on his way to the nurse’s office.
Blat, you’re in a seat in a classroom and you’ve got a little writing desk that you’re crammed into…
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Oh wait, I almost forgot again!
SEA:
You hear a button press and you see oil start to flood the room and a candle appears. It’s slowly burning down.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
OK, so you have 60 seconds before the place goes up in flames. So, you just need to answer these questions as you can. Let’s go!
What colour are the following words? Grass.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…Green?
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Sky.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Blue.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Fear.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… Silver?
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Clothing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Clothing could be many colours.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
I need a colour!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…Rainbow?
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Empathy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Purple.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Wow, that was amazingly well done! That’s awesome. You’re the first one to ever get that one.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I have no idea what I just did.
Laughter.
The walls begin to slide again.
SEA:
The room goes black, opens up again and you are, you’re literally on the edge of a precipice like you’re about to step off a doorway. But there’s like, nothing down there—it’s just water.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Oh, watch your step. Watch your step.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(struggling to balance)
Aaaa.
SEA:
So, Blat, you are basically… The door is behind you, but it’s closed and there’s a tiny little like six-inch lip that you’re standing on and in front of you is water—your favourite.
And there are dark shapes moving in the water and there are stilts—little like, one, maybe two-inch by two-inch pieces of wood that are sticking up out of the water every six or seven feet haphazardly. And on the far side you see an open door.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
So, what’s going to happen is I’m going to press this button and the lip you’re standing on is slowly going to go away. And so all you’ve got to do is just leap from little stick to stick—stilt—to the other side.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was hoping I wouldn’t have to do this.
CARTE:
I begin unbuttoning my cadet shirt, and I toss it away into the water below.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Oh my. You definitely keep in shape!
CARTE:
I unfurl my wings and I simply fly—
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Oh! But—uh—
CARTE:
—to the opposite side.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Oh.
SEA:
(laughing)
OK. You have flight? You have your glide, right?
CARTE:
Yes, yes.
SEA:
So, there’s a silence, and then you hear it you hear a bing outside. He’s like,
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
No no, that’s not fair! That’s…! Oh well, I’ll adjust that later. OK. No flying next time.
SEA:
And the room goes dark.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(calls)
I’m gonna need a shirt.
The walls shift. The sound of a chattering crowd.
SEA:
The room comes up, light, there’s no shirt.
You’re in an outdoor marketplace. You’re just standing in this marketplace suddenly and there’s yelling and vendors… and you’re holding what appears to be a cart-like device that’s made out of a metal cage on four tiny wheels and a push bar.
And to your right are three goblins, each with their own sort of pushcarty device… and one of them gives you the finger. And you hear,
SEAN (AS SWEEPS ANNOUNCER)
(over a loudspeaker)
Welcome to the Super Bazaar Sweeps! Every contestant gets 90 seconds to follow the red path around the square. Be the first back here with the most expensive items in your cart. And remember—anything goes!
SEA:
And a horn goes,
(horn sound)
And the goblins all rush forward with their carts following this path through the bazaar.
CARTE:
I quickly begin to follow one of the goblin carts, not knowing what in this area is worth anything at all, just to see what they’re doing.
SEA:
You see like one of the goblins like—
SEAN (AS A GOBLIN)
(cackles)
SEA:
He grabs something from a vendor and throws it in the cart. Another one basically rams the guy in first place and he screams, and their carts get all tangled up and there’s just one cart now in front of you, and he’s like racing towards this one booth.
CARTE:
I pick up my cart and I begin racing towards the first booth—
SEA:
Picking up?
Laughter.
SEA:
OK! I love it!
CARTE:
—racing towards the goblin heading to the one stall. And when I get to him, I ignore all of the merchandise. I pick the goblin up and I place him inside the cart.
SEA:
(laughing)
OK, roll Defy Danger.
CARTE:
8.
SEA:
OK, so you can grab the goblin, but you’d have to let go of the cart. Like you can grab the goblin, but the other guys are like getting back up and they’re going to pass you.
CARTE:
OK. So, I pick up the goblin—
SEA:
And they race past.
CARTE:
And I immediately run after the last cart to see if I can grab onto it.
CARTE:
So, you’re just carrying the goblin without your cart?
CARTE:
Yes. Yes.
SEA:
The goblin’s like,
SEAN (AS THE GOBLIN)
Hey! Hey, hey!
SEA:
He’s like, still trying to grab things from passing vendors and trying to hold on to them.
SEAN (AS THE GOBLIN)
Hey! No! What are you doing?
CARTE:
I allow him to grab stuff.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fine! Go ahead. Technically this is mine!
SEA:
OK, so you catch up to the next guy because he’s stopped and he’s pouring all the stuff from one vendor who’s yelling at him.
SEAN (AS VENDOR)
Hey, what are you doing?
SEA:
He’s pouring it all into his cart.
CARTE:
I take the goblin that I’m holding. I put him inside the cart, and I begin pushing the cart, grabbing at the second goblin.
SEA:
(laughing)
OK.
Wait a minute, you’re trying to push the cart, you shove a goblin in it, you’re trying to push the cart and grab another goblin?
CARTE:
Yeah. So that I could put that second goblin into the cart.
SEA:
OK, I think you do that, but you wouldn’t be pushing the cart. Like, you throw a goblin in you can then try and grab another goblin.
SEA:
OK. Yes. Yes. So, I put the first goblin in and I’ll try to grab the second goblin.
SEA:
OK. So, roll again.
CARTE:
11.
SEA:
Oh my God, I was so going to have the one goblin climb out while you put the other one in.
OK, you do it. What happens?
CARTE:
I grab the second goblin.
SEAN (AS THE SECOND GOBLIN)
Hey!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
C’mere, you!
SEAN (AS THE SECOND GOBLIN)
What are you doing?
CARTE:
I throw him into the cart on top of the first goblin—
SEAN (AS THE FIRST GOBLIN)
Oof!
CARTE:
—hoping to keep them both down, and then I begin pushing the cart with the two goblins and whatever they managed to grab from the stalls.
SEA:
OK, so in this time the goblin in front of you reached back so you hear the bong. But then you race in right after to the finish line.
So, you see Zieffe appear with his clipboard, and he’s sort of looking at you, and he’s looking at the cart and he’s like,
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Uh, uh… What… what was that, Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(with satisfaction)
You can’t put a price on the lives of goblins.
SEA:
One of the goblins is like,
SEAN (AS THE SECOND GOBLIN)
You tell ’em!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…and whatever this necklace is that he grabbed. This might be worth something as well.
Laughter
SEA:
And that sound goes bong and Zieffe’s like,
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
It’s most most unusual. But yes, I guess you passed! OK.
SEA:
All right. So, the room goes dark.
The walls open.
SEA:
OK, Darcy you hear ding and Blat suddenly appears, looking a little befuddled. He’s naked from the waist up, his wings are fully unfurled and he’s holding a necklace.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sounds like you did very well.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(reluctant)
I don’t like to reveal my wings in public.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why not? They’re cool.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Please don’t look at me.
SEA:
K, Zieffe appears, he’s like,
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
OK, Darcy, you’re last, let’s go!
MIK:
I walk back into the room at this point.
SEA:
OK. So, you come limping. You probably would have healed yourself with the fairy cakes?
MIK:
A little sore though.
SEA:
Roll fairy cakes.
MIK:
That’s an 8 plus wisdom… total of 9.
SEA:
You’re blind but you’re fully healed.
Laughter.
SEA:
It happens every once in a while. It’s a side effect, right? Wears off.
MARIS:
Too many fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. I’m over here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat, I’m, I’m feeling a bit better, but I’m… Blat, is that you? Blat? What are these big leathery things?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Please, never mind the leathery things. You don’t need to be… touching—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s very soft, but warm, too—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You don’t need to manhandle what you’re feeling. Quit grabbing!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Sorry, sorry. I’ve just never felt something so luxurious.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. Have…
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Have you gone fairy cake blind?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I mixed the fairy cake with the potion the healer gave me. And you know, sometimes when you ride the bull, you get thrown off.
DARCY’S ASSESSMEN:
The walls slide closed.
SEA:
OK, so Mees, you suddenly appear in a room and you’re alone and you hear Zieffe’s voice echoing all around you. He’s like,
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
OK, so we’re going to get this started. Here we go! Just do your best, Darcy!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(miserably)
OK.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
There’s the spirit!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Mmhmm.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Oh boy. OK.
The walls slide around.
The sound of a lively crowd and a calliope playing cheerful circus music.
SEA:
And you hear some levers and then all of a sudden it goes totally dark and comes up… and you’re in a carnival. Like a future carnival. Like, a Balgomar carnival.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
I’m back!
SEA:
And you see a man, and everything just sort of, no matter which way you turn you keep being drawn back to this—it’s like a dream—one of those games where you have to swing the sledgehammer to ring the bell. And he’s like,
SEAN (AS CARNY)
Step up! Step up! Try your strength!
What about you, young lady?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(flatly)
I think I have to.
SEAN (AS CARNY)
Here you go!
SEA:
And he hands you the sledge hammer and he pretends that he almost drops it—
SEAN (AS CARNY)
Ha ha ha!
SEA:
—and a crowd’s gathering.
SEAN (AS CARNY)
Here you go.
MARIS:
And I grab the hammer.
SEAN (AS CARNY)
Swing it! Show these men what ladies of Balgomar have!
MARIS:
And I sort of mechanically just swing it over my shoulder and bring it down on the thing.
SEA:
The little thing goes bloop… plunk. It’s just sort of silent.
SEAN (AS CARNY)
Come on! Come on, you can do better than that! Give it a swing!
MARIS:
(groans)
So then I pick it up again, and I give it a bit of a harder swing, then I do it again.
SEA:
Bloop. You hear Zieffe go,
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Uh, this is the part where everyone’s supposed to be laughing. That’s really bad, Darcy…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(with building rage)
I can’t believe… that you’ve brought me to your stupid past and trapped me in this stupid made up world to test some sort of, what, strength or something that I have?
When I get out of here I’m going to take this hammer…
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
(worried)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And I’m gonna picture your head…
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
(whimpers)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…and I’m gonna do this to it!
MARIS:
And I take that hammer and I bring it down with all my might.
SEA:
Roll +Strength.
MARIS:
I’m a 9, so I have no plus anything, right?
SEA:
OK. No.
MARIS:
(smug)
10.
SEA:
What happens?
MARIS:
(with feeling)
I swing that hammer and the stone or whatever it is, just soars right up and keeps going and breaks through the top of it, and goes soaring over the people. And the crowds cheer… and there is a new champion in Imaginary Carnival World.
The walls shift.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
That was really good, Darcy, though I’m a little afraid.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You should be. You should be.
SEA:
Outside, you guys hear bing bing bing!
(laughing)
And then you see a bell come flying up and land on the ground. Clangity clang!
OK, so Mees… you are standing on… like, you suddenly just almost lose your balance. You’re standing on a tiny lip, maybe five inches, that’s sticking out from the wall.
And even with it, stretching forward for about 30 feet, are just gleaming nails. Like, sharp, all up, about an inch apart, all the way across. And you see there is a platform that’s level with it, and a door on the far side.
And you hear Zieffe go,
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
(nervous)
Uh… I don’t think I’m going to say anything. I just… you gotta to get to the door.
SEA:
And then it goes silent.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(seething)
You’re in so much trouble, Zieffe.
MARIS:
(laughing)
So, I have delicate little human feet. So I do not like where this is going. But I know for this to end I just have to get across it.
SEA:
The lip beneath your feet starts to slowly retract.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Nghhh!
MARIS:
So I leap on to the nails and I just run on the balls of my feet as much as I can, and the whole time I’m going—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Agh! Agh! I am going to do so many horrible things to you, Zieffe! Aaaagh!
SEA:
(laughing)
You guys hear that. You hear a BZZZT!
The walls slide.
SEA:
And there’s oil starting to flood the room—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What is going on?!
SEA:
And a candle appears.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
(stammering)
Uh, you’re not going to like this one, either. That’s a flammable, flammable… flammable, uh, oil and a candle. You have 60 seconds. Just answer as many questions as you can on the test in front of you. First question: uh…
Wagon A leaves Paradox with two horses pulling it—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ugh! I hate these puzzles!
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Two hours later wagon B leaves Paradox travelling in the same direction with three horses pulling it. How far from Paradox will the second wagon overtake the first?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wherever your head ends up!
Laughter.
SEA:
Bing!
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
What is the boiling point of an egg in pyrometres?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(casually)
10.
SEA:
Bing!
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Calculate the solution to the following equation:
SEA:
And the wall in front of you, the chalkboard, just fills with this massive equation.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(businesslike)
Well, if you take the hypotneski of the quorshnovati and the sningen flingen, it’s going to be the 1 over the 3 or 514—
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Fifteen seconds!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And it’s… 324.
SEA:
Bing!
The walls slide open.
SEA:
Darcy, you appear—her feet are bloody.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sobbing dramatically)
This hurts so much.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What hurts so much?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(furious)
My feet! I had to walk across a bed of nails!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did you get shot a bunch?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(mocking)
Oh, you got some arrows. Look at my feet!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t see your feet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(growls)
MARIS:
And I sit down.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
He’s gone… cake blind.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(snaps)
Have you not got a shirt yet?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No.
SEA:
You hear Zieffe’s voice:
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
(over the speaker)
I—I was going to congratulate you all, but I’m a little afraid of Darcy right now. So, if you’ll just go across the hall to your classroom, the adjunct has set up your first class.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gritted teeth)
I can’t walk.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t see.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…I’m a little cold.
SEAN (AS ZIEFFE)
Um, yeah, so if you want to carry Darcy up to the healer on the second floor, then you can go to your classroom.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you…
THE CLASSROO:
SEA:
We’re going to cut to a little bit later in time. Darcy’s feet are bandaged. Blat, you found another shirt.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Excellent.
SEA:
Do you want to cut slits in it? No, you want to keep that stuff—
CARTE:
Hidden away.
SEA:
Under wraps.
CARTE:
I’m a man… with red skin. I’m not a demon.
SEA:
And you can see now again, roughly, a little bit.
MIK:
Roughly.
SEA:
It’s a little fuzzy right now—
MIK:
Fuzzy is fun though…
SEA:
But yeah, it’s a good time.
And you guys have filed into your classroom. It’s quite a large classroom. Probably could fit like 50 to 60 students or what-have-you in it. There are chairs that have built-in desks. There is a chalkboard… and on the chalkboard is written: EGO PLEBIUM.
And on three desks are three name tags, one for each of you. So, Darcy, Blat and Eggerton, there is a desk with your names on a little card. And on each desk are some books.
You all sitting down?
MARIS:
We are.
CARTE:
Yes.
SEA:
So Darcy, you have two books. One has a sword on it and one has a holy symbol on it.
MARIS:
Ooh.
SEA:
Blat, you have two books. One has horns on it and one has a sword on it.
Eggerton…
MARIS:
You have eight books.
SEA:
You have one book.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I only get one book? Everyone else gets… But you know I only need one book, because it’s a better book.
SEA:
And it has a plant symbol on it.
MARIS:
Ooo.
I open up the book with the holy symbol on it.
SEA:
OK. It’s like written in some weird hieroglyphs.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Can any of you read your books?
MIK:
I open my book and try to read it.
SEA:
Same thing. It’s just weird.
MIK:
After attempting to read it I turn and say—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, I cannot.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, this is the best classroom ever.
CARTE:
I open up the horn book.
SEA:
Same thing. It’s just strange lines and almost like, back when you were filing, where you would have seen circuit diagrams and stuff? It’s almost like that.
CARTE:
I hold the book away from me as far as I can, to see if I can make out a pattern.
SEA:
Nope.
Silence.
CARTE:
I put the book down and then rest my head on my desk.
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think the books are broken.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shouldn’t we have a teacher?
MIK:
Is there a chalkboard?
SEA:
Yes, something is written on it.
MIK:
What does it say? Ego…
MARIS:
Plebian.
MIK:
Plebian?
SEA:
Plebium.
MIK:
Plebium?
MARIS:
Plebium.
MIK:
Plebium?
MARIS:
That’s what I said.
MARIS:
Does anyone speak Latin?
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Let’s just say my ego is feeling quite “plebium” at the moment.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello, is anyone here? We’re in a classroom and we don’t know what we’re doing.
Silence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ego plebium?
A magical shimmer.
SEA:
Your books both glow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(with wonder)
I think it’s a magic word.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There’s no such thing as a magic word.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I know. But look at my books!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasp of amazement)
They’re glowing!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, what what was it what that was was the word?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ego Plebium.
The shimmer returns.
SEA:
Both your books light up again.
MIK:
I look at my book and say,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ego… Plebium!
Another shimmering sound, this time higher.
SEA:
It lights up.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(smug)
Magic.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So apparently saying “My ego is feeling rather plebium” wasn’t quite correct…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You have to say them together, Blat.
CARTE:
I hold the horn book up to my face and I whisper,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(with distaste)
Ego plebium.
A third distinct shimmer.
SEA:
It lights up.
MARIS:
So, then I…
SEA:
Which book do you open?
MARIS:
The holy symbol book.
SEA:
OK.
MARIS:
For me. Obviously.
SEA:
Yeah.
CARTE:
I open up the horn book.
MIK:
I wasn’t given a choice.
The shimmer swells into a crackling and a rushing wind.
SEA:
Blat, you are suddenly sucked into your book, like, ripped apart into the book in pieces. It’s sort of painful. And—
MARIS:
Geez.
CARTE:
It’s sort of painful?
Laughter.
MARIS:
As ripping apart is.
The wind builds to a crescendo, then ends sharply. Drums beat out a slow, pounding rhythm, accompanied by distorted guitar chords.
SEA:
And suddenly you’re standing on the desolate plains and fire is roaring up every once in a while, out of different pockets.
And you see a full-fledged demon—not a half-demon—striding forward toward you. And it says,
SEAN (AS DEMON)
(deep, booming voice)
Ah, so you’re the new plebe.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(wearily)
I see. Yes. Old-timey demon nonsense.
My friend, I come from a future point in history where our people have moved away from this entire Hades, oh-look-at-me-aren’t-I-so—
SEAN (AS DEMON)
DRAW YOUR SWORD!
SEA:
And an axe appears in its hands—giant, like seven-foot-long axe.
SEAN (AS DEMON)
…or be struck down.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Again… I come from a point where medieval, mano a mano fisticuffs is looked down upon.
Also, I lack the “sword” that you demand that I “draw” before you cleave me.
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Oh, this is going to be fun.
SEA:
And he cleaves you in half with the axe.
A bright shing! of a blade. Another crackle of energy.
SEA:
And you rip apart into a million pieces and then you feel yourself pulled all the way back together again. And you’re standing on the lost forbidden plains. Fire is coming out of pockets to your left and your right, and you see a full-fledged demon striding towards you.
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Oh, this is going to be so much fun.
The music ends.

ON LEARNIN:
ANANK:
Almost always the best teachers come in unexpected form.
Some people go to school to be a witch. This is stupid. I was sent to school, but my best teacher there was a spider living in my room.
But there is no teacher like real experience. Try and fail and learn.
Books? Books are good. But books can only teach so much. And this is coming from a librarian.
But what is even better? A book that is an experience. Best of both worlds. Maybe not so good for teaching facts and figures. It is more for… life skills.
Like saving the world.

Episode 4: The Academy of The Fallen, Part 3.
THE MOUNTAI:
A fierce wind howls.
SEA:
Darcy. You’re on a narrow path against the side of a cliff. The wind is howling, tugging at you. And just inches from your right foot is a drop of at least a thousand feet.
The path widens ahead, but the wind is howling harder, and you see a spire as you reach the top of what appears to be a mountain peak. And some fallen stones mark the beginning of an old temple, now mostly open to the elements, except for the westernmost part of the structure.
You can smell peppermint.
DARC:
So, I make my way carefully along the path towards this… temple, did you say?
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
This is exciting! I’m rolling the dice.
MIK:
Did you just throw them on the floor?
MARIS:
Yeah. I’m dropping the dice first. Now I’m rolling the dice…
It’s an 8. Danger defied.
No I don’t.
SEA:
Danger partially defied.
MARIS:
Oh darn.
SEA:
So, you’re moving forward on this narrow path. And ahead is safe ground… but it’s not a pure success. And the wind catches you and you start to lose your balance and you’re about to fall and plummet.
Your choices are: drop something so you can grab on… or risk falling.
MARIS:
What do I have to drop?
(laughs)
SEA:
I don’t know. What might you be holding?
MARIS:
I don’t even know where I am.
SEA:
The book? Your My, whatever, Existential book or…
MARIS:
Sure. OK I can be holding the book and drop the book.
SEA:
OK.
MARIS:
Very reluctantly.
SEA:
So you drop the My Existential Crisis book, and barely grab onto the ledge and crawl forward to safer ground. And you see what used to be a temple, it looks like, in front of you.
And that’s when you notice on the stone right where your hand landed is a symbol that lights up as your hand touches it. And you instantly recognize it as the symbol of Loxsyn.
MARIS:
So, I pick my hand up. Are there any other symbols?
SEA:
You see that symbol in the rock. You see what might be a symbol on what’s sort of left of what might have been the doorway into the the ruins.
MARIS:
My hand automatically goes to my neck where I have this stone on this threadbare cord. And I clutch it and it’s feeling a bit warmer, which it hasn’t felt for a while since I came to this place. And I keep moving forward.
SEA:
K. So, tell me what Loxsyn stands for?
MARIS:
She was introduced to me as a goddess of healing and restoration.
SEA:
Does she have another side to her?
MARIS:
Not that I’ve really learned. I’m just very new to this.
SEA:
OK. So as you come forward, the scent in the wind the scent of peppermint comes and goes, and you sort of step into the ruins, down a bit… and it’s much quieter, sheltered from the wind and you see there’s a small fire in that part of the ruins that still have a roof that are otherwise… One side is open to the elements.
A small fire crackles.
SEA:
And you see a small figure. As in really small—like a foot and a half tall, sort of pottering around around a fire in there. And you see what looks like living quarters of some kind.
So, the figure appears to be pouring tea and the scent of peppermint is much stronger now. And the figure turns and says,
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
(high-pitched but gruff)
Hmph. About time!
SEA:
And sets one of the cups of tea on the ground right inside their domicile, and steps back and starts pouring another small thimble of tea.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry. Were you waiting for me?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
(grunt)
You can drink the tea or not.
SEA:
So, as you get closer are you notice that this individual, while they’re a foot and a half tall, they look like a full-fledged troll. Like the colour of their skin and the structure of their face, older sort of greying, and this figure is drinking their thimble of tea.
MARIS:
So, I crouch down, getting very close to the the little figure, but not right in their face, but just so I’m more down to their level and I ask,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(uncertainly)
Excuse me. Who… who are you? Where is this?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Not one for simple questions. One question at a time!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, that’s fair. Who are you?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
The name is Davinn.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hi Davinn, I’m Darcy.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Yeah, I know.
SEA:
Davinn sort of climbs up on the table that is in there and sits down so that Davinn is closer to eye level.
MARIS:
So then I go inside this place, and I take the tea that I think has been put out for me.
SEA:
The little thimble?
MARIS:
Oh yeah. The little thimble of tea. And I take as sip. And I ask-.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You… you’re my teacher? My teacher for what?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
You’re in my book. So, I must be your teacher.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK. There was a symbol out there—a symbol that I recognized from where I’m from. Do you know anything about that?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
What do you know about it?
SEA:
…says Yoda.
CARTE:
(Yoda voice)
Hmmm! Show you book I will!
Laughter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… Not a lot. It’s just something that means something to me. It helps me with something… some difficulties I have.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
So Loxsyn is here to help you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Loxsyn, yes. That’s the name… that’s the goddess that brings me comfort.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Oh, that’s lovely. So Loxsyn helps you. Brings you comfort. What do you bring Loxsyn?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I didn’t know I had to bring Loxsyn anything.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Hmm.
Why Loxsyn?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, she’s… supposed to help with healing and, uh, and restoring people to their normal selves and… that’s important to me, because sometimes I really don’t feel like myself. And she came to me at a time when I thought I was really lost and I needed her. And I’m really surprised that she’s still here in your place. I thought she would only be known in Balgomar.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
(sarcastic)
That was great! I wish I’d played some music during that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
Well, why are you here then? What are you supposed to teach me? Are you just supposed to make fun of me?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
(grunt)
You believe in Loxsyn?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, I think so.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Well, let’s find out.
So you’re going to climb down this mountain, this path. And then you’re going to climb back up again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK…
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Then we’ll see.
SEA:
Davinn stands up and points in the centre of where the ruins are, and you see there’s just like, a black hole in the floor.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m supposed to go down there?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
All the way down, back up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
OK.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Or maybe Loxsyn—not worth it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine.
MARIS:
So, I walk over, and I look down into this pit, I guess it is. Is there a staircase or a…?
SEA:
You see little handholds in the rock just going down, straight down, as far as you can see.
MARIS:
So, I turn to this little troll and I say—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you speak to Loxsyn? Do you believe in Loxsyn?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
I do.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(lets out a breath)
OK.
MARIS:
I carefully lower myself into this pit using the handholds.
SEA:
Let’s roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
(gasps)
Roll Defy Danger again.
SEA:
So, when you roll Defy Danger you’re going to pick whatever ability is most pertinent to this, so…
MARIS:
Which is Dexterity.
SEA:
It would be Dexterity or Strength because it’s a long way. So… and then you would add that bonus.
MARIS:
Okay, so I’m rolling to Defy Danger using my Dexterity score.
That’s a 6+1… that’s a 7.
The wind howls louder.
SEA:
Well, lucky for that 1…
So, you, as you start down, you realize that some of these handholds are weak and loose and stone is crumbling. And then as you go lower, one side opens up to the elements so that you’re literally like, in a U shape, climbing down the mountain and the wind starts to clutch at you and pull at you and at one point it literally blows you off of the handhold and you are literally hanging by one hand on a handhold.
What do you want to try and do? What can you use—I don’t even know what equipment you have—as you feel yourself being pulled off the mountain you’re barely clutching on with one hand…
MARIS:
Uh… Is there—I don’t even know what she could do. There’s nothing else around that she can grasp onto or put a foot in? Like maybe anchor her foot in a…
SEA:
I think she could anchor her foot in something, but it might result in an injury. Like, she would have to ram it into the handhold as she’s being ripped away.
MARIS:
OK….
SEA:
And she might end up… Right? It’s a desperate move.
MARIS:
Okay. I think her best bet is going to be to try to jump down a little further to a more stable handhold.
SEA:
Okay so you’re… So, she starts to be ripped away and she, Darcy screams and lets go—
Small rocks tumble away into the pit.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
And is falling, attempting to grab onto another handhold, not as a professional climber.
MARIS:
No. Not a professional climber.
SEA:
Okay, so—
MARIS:
But I did take gymnastics.
SEA:
Because you rolled a 7 you are going to slam your head against the rock. Your body, you’re flipping you end up upside down your foot catches on a handhold and your head hits again.
MARIS:
Ugh! This isn’t good.
SEA:
You’re going to take 4 hit points of damage and you are now hanging upside down, and it turns out as you’re sort of desperately trying to find another handhold, you realize that it’s the edge of your boot that is just caught on one of the handholds.
MARIS:
OK.
SEA:
And you are… Well, you don’t even know your way up the side of this mountain. There’s a long way still to go down.
MARIS:
OK. So, I’m upside down at this point.
SEA:
Yup.
MARIS:
OK. So, I twist around to try and find my hands—somewhere that my hands can grasp onto, so I can at least have some leverage to release my foot and turn myself the right way round.
SEA:
You’re able to.
MARIS:
OK, so now I’m again in climbing position.
SEA:
Darcy, the rain is starting up. The wind is howling around you. The darkness is closing in reaching for you. I want to know what’s going through your head.
MARIS:
I’m really scared. I’ve… I actually think I might die. I’ve, I’ve never been in a position like this in my whole life and I’m terrified. But there’s also this rising determination in me that for the first time in this place I’ve seen something that connects me to home and that’s familiar to me and I feel if I can just get out of this pit that maybe there will be something here that makes sense.
SEA:
So, we leave Darcy huddled against the side of this mountain.
THE KITCHE:
Forest birds chirp. The sound echoes unnaturally.
SEA:
We cut to the fairy circle.
And we are high above Farloria with that same eagle who is banking around, and lets out a screech as she sees something in the forest far, far below and dives, racing down at high speed towards this glade… as there is a pop sound.
A musical pop echoes in the glade.
SEA:
And standing on top of the stone in the centre of this glade… is Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…Oh dear.
SEA:
So Eggerton, the last thing you knew before this was opening that book and feeling your whole body just being ripped apart, and then everything in a flash of light—you’re suddenly standing in a familiar glade. Only now you’re… It feels a little different. It takes you a minute to realize it’s because you are much higher now, in that glade.
MIK:
Much higher… like, up the glade itself?
SEA:
You’re on top of the fae stone.
MIK:
Oh, OK. I just want to make we’re talking about the same kind of high. That would take the story in a different direction.
Laughter.
SEA:
So, you’re standing on the fae stone. Literally, power is roaring out of it and up your legs out of this fae stone and it’s just… it’s like you can feel the forest around you and everything in it through this fae stone.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Tingly!
I wonder why I can smell like a squirrel right now. And why there’s a bunny rabbit over there and what that flower is looking at. Is it looking at the bunny rabbit or is the… Oh! Oh no. The bunny is coming over to the flower. No, bunny. No! No, I like that flower!
Oh geez.
The faraway sound of a harp.
SEA:
And you hear what sounds like music coming from beneath you, out of the fae stone—like, coming out of the crack in the fae stone.
MIK:
I look down and can I see any kind of separation in the crack, or is it just like a… is there space?
SEA:
Oh yeah.
MIK:
Lots of space? How much space are we talking?
SEA:
Well, it looks like a few inches… but as you bend down and look at it, it’s like it’s widening.
MIK:
Ooo. All right. So, I’m going to go down on my hands and knees and get my eye right up against it.
SEA:
OK. And you see the most unbelievably stupendous kitchen you have ever seen in your life.
MIK:
Ooh.
SEA:
Angels sing. And there’s this cleanliness to everything and everything is ordered and there are big long tables. And it’s been created for someone of a particular height.
MIK:
(softly)
My height?
SEA:
Yup. Your height, Eggerton.
MIK:
Ohhh.
SEA:
And it’s empty. But you hear music coming from it, as if a radio had been left on.
MIK:
Can I get into the kitchen?
SEA:
I don’t know…
MIK:
Can I try and sort of wiggle my way between the cracks?
SEA:
K. So, we cut back to the eagle that’s circling and circling, looking at a tasty rabbit—when the eagle’s gaze snaps over to the top of the fae stone, where it sees half of Eggerton, feet kicking in the air as he manages to squeeze down into a two-inch crack and pops out of existence.
The music reaches a crescendo and comes to a sharp stop. The forest sounds fade.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh gee.
The harp returns, along with a jaunty, jazzy rhythm on drums and bass.
SEA:
Eggerton. You’re standing before a door that you can see through the glass of the door is that kitchen and, on the door, it says: The Rolling Scones Bake ‘N’ Cake.
MIK:
Sounds yummy!
Can I open the door?
SEA:
I hope so!
MIK:
All right! I’m going to try to open that door!
SEA:
All right. The door swings open and you hear the music and you see this gleaming kitchen with everything marked. You see tiny little drawers all down at your height with every… like, you’re just walking past the craziest ingredients, from chocolate to fairy dust to things you haven’t even heard of.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They have fairy dust? I’ve never even seen fairy dust before. I’d only heard about it. Wonder if I could use it in some cakes? Maybe I’ll just take a little bit, put in my pouch for later.
MIK:
I grab a little handful and shove it into my pouch.
SEA:
Yup! You open the drawer, you see gleaming fairy dust and it goes… It’s like all partying…
SEAN (AS FAIRY DUST)
(squeaky)
Yay! How’s it going, Eggerton?!
SEA:
And you put some of it in your pouch.
MIK:
…Fairy dust can talk.
SEA:
This fairy dust can.
MIK:
All right. It’s that kind of a party.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIK:
I wander around looking at the other drawers, and start plucking out some ingredients that I could maybe use to make—
SEA:
The chrysantheyums are really laid-back, dude…
You take them and put them on the counter and they’re like,
SEAN (AS CRYSANTHEYUMS)
(a lazy surfer-like drawl)
Heyyy, Eggerton! What are you going to make with us?
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I feel… conflicted about making anything with you now… chrysanthenums!
SEAN (AS CRYSANTHEYUM)
No dude, we’re good with iiit. We want to make somethin’ yummy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(hesitant)
OK, maybe I’ll… make, uh, some fairy cakes.
SEAN (AS CRYSANTHEYUM)
Yeah dude! That’d be amaaazing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Most… tubular, I hear.
So, I… I’ll just go over here and look for some Impescor sugar while you hang out over there, chrysantheyums.
SEAN (AS CRYSANTHEYUM)
Yeah, this is good here.
SEA:
OK, so you find like, there are literally a hundred and three types of sugar.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
103 types of sugar! Which one is Impescor?
SEA:
You don’t see Impescor.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s very strange.
SEA:
You see flavored sugars, you see different versions of fairy sugars based on clan. You see sugars based on like sweetness tables. You just see… It’s a pretty impressive list of like… sugars.
MIK:
All right, well, I’m going to just sort of randomly grab one because there’s too many to make an actual decision.
SEA:
Oh yeah.
MIK:
And put it on the counter and I’m going to go and… is the music still playing?
SEA:
Oh yeah.
MIK:
All right, I’m going to kind of boogie along then, ’cause you can’t help but dance to some good music in the kitchen. And I am going to go over and find other ingredients for fairy cakes like flour and Purple Swirlys.
SEA:
Oh, they have many Purple Swirlys.
MIK:
Excellent. Can’t have too many of those. Couple of sprinkles, and I’ve got the fairy dust in my pouch.
The music begins to waver, growing more and more disorienting.
SEA:
There’s like a party happening on the counter. Like, some of them are dancing and there’s rocking out, and some of them are starting to like, put themselves in the bowl… The bowl is talking to you like—
SEAN (AS MIXING BOWL)
(deep, and a little sinister)
Oh yeah! This is gonna be good. Mix me baby, mix me!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So, I don’t mean to be rude, Mixing Bowl, but is it perhaps possible that I had some bad fairy cakes prior to this little adventure, and that is why you and the Chrysantheyum and the apple—the one apple, he looks kind of angry but he’s an apple—why they’re talking, because I don’t ever remember these things talking before but…
SEAN (AS APPLE)
(shrill and furious)
Natural sugar is the best! Why are you using the other? You should be using natural sugar, like an apple! Me!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, Apple, just, you know. That’s OK. I’ll consider that for next time, but I’m, uh wondering why, perhaps, anyone can tell me why all of you are talking, because I don’t remember foods talking before and it’s kind of neat, it’s nice, it’s like hey, we’re having a kitchen party, but at the same time I need to chop you up and mix you, and I’m having mixed feelings about that. You say you’re okay with it—
SEAN (AS RANDOM INGREDIENTS)
Hey, we’ll chop ourselves!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um…
SEA:
You see like a bunch of the ingredients jump into… The knife is like dancing through them, and they’re laughing and then the little pieces are running and jumping into the bowl.
SEAN (AS RANDOM INGREDIENTS)
There’s more of us now! Yaaay!
MIK:
I’m going to have nightmares about this. I just want everyone to know.
The music ends.
SEA:
Now we cut away…
Hysterical laughter.
MIK:
What in the f***.
SEA:
Everyone has a green card. You might have some questions for the End Notes!
MARIS:
I thought he was being mean to me, but he was really mean to you.
MIK:
I’m writing “What the…”
MARIS:
I don’t know what I have in mine. I don’t know where I am…
MIK:
(off mic)
“What the flup.”
CARTE:
I’m sorry. I’m battling a giant demon alone. You’re in a kitchen!
MARIS:
At least you know why and where you are!
CARTE:
Not really!
MARIS:
Yeah, you do. You’re battling a demon.
THE FORGOTTEN PLAIN:
A pounding drumbeat begins.
SEA:
So, with that… we are blasted down into the earth, leaving the kitchen and the dancing and the singing, down and down and down. We’re passing layer after layer, past the magma, past the centre of the earth into other realms.
And then we slow down as we come zooming in on the forgotten plains and everything is grey and red and there’s smoke, there’s magma bursting up into flame out of little holes. And we see Blat flying up as a full-fledged ten-foot demon with an eight-foot battle axe comes storming forward going,
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Oh, this is going to be fun.
The music ends on a heavy guitar chord.
CARTE:
I rip off my shirt and I fly upwards to try to avoid the next hit.
SEA:
So that would be a Defy Danger roll.
CARTE:
Ooh, of course.
SEA:
And I assume that… So that could be basically Strength or Dex.
CARTE:
Uh… it’s going to be Dex so I’ll get a +1 bonus from that…
That would be a 7.
SEA:
With the bonus?
CARTE:
With the bonus.
MARIS:
I’m familiar with that roll.
SEA:
(laughs)
So that’s a mixed success. So, you are going to… You roar up into the air going away when you feel him latch onto your leg with one hand and start to pull you back down, but you’re able to break free… But you leave half your leg behind.
CARTE:
Ohh!
SEA:
You take 6 hit points of damage—
CARTE:
6 hit points of damage!
SEA:
As he laughs—
SEAN (AS DEMON)
HA HA HA HA!
SEA:
And throws it over his shoulder into a magma pit and he’s like—
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Come on down, flappy-flap. Let’s do this.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(strained)
All right. I have 30 credits on me… I’m just gonna take my wallet. And I’m dropping it down.
I don’t know if you use that in this realm. But I’m hoping we can call it square.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is it possible my leg could grow back? I was cleaved in half before and reassembled. So… 30 credits for a leg? Is that fair?
SEA:
OK. This giant demon, who’s like just gleaming red, is just staring down at this thing on the ground—your wallet that you dropped—and he’s looking a little perplexed and he looks up to you and in the sky and he’s like—
SEAN (AS DEMON)
DRAW YOUR WEAPON! WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET YOU TO FIGHT ME?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…Money can be a weapon!
SEA:
And he throws his battleaxe as hard as he can. You see it flipping end over end. It is heading right towards you.
CARTE:
I will certainly fly to get out of the way of that!
SEA:
Okay, Defy Danger.
CARTE:
Defy Danger again. There’s less of me to avoid it so maybe that’ll be easier.
That’s an 11.
SEA:
What happens?
CARTE:
I flap out of the way and the axe just sticks into a stalagmite that’s hanging down off of the wall. And then I attempt to pull the axe free so that I can have a weapon for myself.
SEA:
Okay. He’s watching you pull this axe free, and then you get it and he’s just staring at you. He’s like—
SEAN (AS DEMON)
(to himself)
Oh man, this is gonna be a good.
SEA:
And he raises his hand and the axe appears in it…
A metallic shing!
SEA:
…and you’re suddenly holding nothing. And he’s like—
SEAN (AS DEMON)
CALL YOUR WEAPON!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Call my… weap… you didn’t call your weapon! I…
SEA:
Uh… And he roars, and he bends down and he leaps. Like, you’ve never seen anything like it. He’s… You’re pretty high up and you see him just… He launches toward you like the Hulk, a red Hulk flying at you.
Your move.
CARTE:
So Blat closes his eyes, and thinks really really hard: weapon, weapon, weapon, weapon… and just yells at the top of his lungs—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
BAZOOKA!
Tense silence.
SEA:
And you feel something happen. Opening your eyes and you see he’s just about to impact you and you feel this surge of energy and what appears in your hand, Blat?
CARTE:
I’m hoping… instead of say, a Dalmatian… it’s a bazooka.
Laughter.
SEA:
Never give pimping power to an improvver!
MARIS:
Do we even know what bazookas are?
SEA:
Well, we do now!
A clattering as metal parts magically slide and click together.
SEA:
Blat, you feel—it literally materializes out of the air, like, in pieces. And you see the tube, you feel it. It pops right into your hand as if it’s always been there, the trigger, you see the eyepiece pop up right in front of your face.
The final piece snaps into place.
SEA:
And he is almost—like, you don’t even see anything to target because there is just red in your viewfinder, because he is like six feet away coming at a crazy speed right at you.
CARTE:
I’m hoping that any bazooka that I come up with is easy to operate. Perhaps a one-button bazooka…
SEA:
There’s a trigger under your finger…
CARTE:
I’ll squeeze that trigger as hard as I can.
SEA:
Let’s roll Attack.
CARTE:
All right, Attack! So that’s…
MIK:
Is that Volley?
SEA:
In this case I guess it would be Volley.
CARTE:
All right. Just going to roll a number here.
SEA:
It’s plus Dex.
CARTE:
4+1. That’s a 5.
SEA:
So, you see a look of glee when the weapon starts to appear and it’s quite large, coming right into your face and then you see a moment of sort of confusion and the bazooka, you feel it kick—and you fly back a little bit, which saves you a little. And it sends this projectile, missile, firing out with gas streaming off it, it hits him right dead on, but the explosion is massive…
The rocket hisses out from the bazooka and detonates. Everything goes quiet.
SEA:
…and you don’t really see it. You just feel yourself—whoosh—reassembling…
Rushing energy as Blat is reassembled.
SEA:
And you’re standing on the lost plains. And you see a very large—and laughing—full-fledged demon, coming towards you and raising his hand and having an axe appear in it, and he’s like—
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Now that’s more like it!
CARTE:
I reach down, grab my wallet, throw it at him as hard as I can…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I have a dry cleaner coupon in there!
CARTE:
And then I attempt to run off again. Running start, so I can fly to see if there’s any exit at all in this place.
SEA:
So everywhere you look there is bizarreness. Like, there’ll suddenly be a wall with a stalactite on it. Then there’ll just be nothing. And then there’ll be something like… a tea set. And you see this beautiful tea set that’s fully set with the… What do they call that large thing they bring the tea cakes out on?
MARIS:
It’s a tray?
SEA:
A tray. A stacked series of trays, and there’s two teacups and there’s two chairs. And you hear this beep-beep-beep-beep—and you hear from behind, as you are launching off, like—
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Oh, time for tea. Let’s take a break, Blat.
SEA:
And you see this hulking 10-foot demon go stomping—POW, POW—over to the tea place. Pull out a chair, throw it away because he’ll never fit in it, and then just hunker down in front of the tea set and start pouring tea into two cups.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…I’m sorry, what?
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Um, it’s break time. You know, there’s rules. Come have a cup of tea. Do you like sugar? Milk? Are you one of those lemon people?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… Just the sugar is fine… uh…
SEAN (AS DEMON)
One or two?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, two is good…
SEA:
He’s like trying to… With his big hands he tries to get and he just smashes the tea thing and just pulls out two and drops it in yours. And then he starts sipping his tea. With his pinky up.
CARTE:
I sit down in the chair across from him.
Silence.
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Don’t forget to get your wallet after, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Do I get to keep my wallet?
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Oh yes. Anything you bring in you want to take back out. Unless you want to leave it with me. It gets pretty boring in here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Are you going to let me out?
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Yeah, I’m just here to teach you. Didn’t you know that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No! Why would I know that?
SEAN (AS DEMON)
Eh. This school’s gone to hell. They used to explain this stuff. Name’s Reginald by the way.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Your name’s Reginald?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in the same tone of disbelief)
…Hello Reginald.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Hey Blat.
So, you waited a long time to call your weapon. What was up with that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I… I didn’t know I could call a weapon!
Where I come from I just work in a place with papers that I organize, and then I go home… I donate the occasional bit of money to the local theatre… I don’t know anything about any of this!
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
(sighs)
I miss the theatre.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I too miss the theatre. The upcoming season sounded like it was going to be really good.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
What were they doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I don’t know if you’re aware of the shows, they probably haven’t been written yet—there was this lovely one where this woman has to choose between three different suitors, but it turns out that the one that she chooses is actually dying.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Oh. Ohhh, that sounds wonderful.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, it’s very sad, but it’s also quite lovely because he has a son who she eventually adopts, and together they live happily with memories of the love that they once held—
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?!
SEA:
He laughs.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Oh, we’re almost out of tea time, so I’m going to give you a couple minutes to go get your wallet. And we’re going to pick it up again. We have one more round and then I’m going to, yeah, send you back to school.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Do I get to keep all of my body parts?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Heh, not if I have any say in it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(groans)
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
All right. Go get your wallet, and we’re going to get started again.
SEA:
And he stands up and starts doing some stretches.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
(grunts)
Remember to stretch, Blat. Don’t want to pull anything, heh heh… when I kill you.
CARTE:
I bend forward and try to make a popping sound happen in the small of my back. I hear something give. I wince… and then I take my teacup throw it at his face and try to fly towards the ceiling.
The pounding drums begin again.
SEA:
And he roars—
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
YEAAAH!
SEA:
And the battle ax appears in his hand and he charges after you.
MIDROLL: THE GREEN ROO:
A brief music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of the End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
(shouts off mic)
Yeah. Five minutes! I’m just going to be in the green room.
Oh man, they never stop! Hey Carter.
CARTE:
Hey how’s it going?
SEA:
Good just to get some—oh man, there’s no coffee.
CARTE:
Well there’s an empty pot if that helps you out at all.
SEA:
There’s no food, no coffee…
CARTE:
No, it’s just a room that’s green. That’s all that we really promise you here.
SEA:
All right. Can you help me get into this…? This is ridiculous. Look at the size of this Snegal costume.
CARTE:
Well, again, I don’t see why it’s so necessary for you to wear a Snegal costume. This is a podcast. No one can actually see anything.
SEA:
(sigh)
I have to be in character.
CARTE:
You have to be in character? It’s just a goofy voice that you’re doing. There’s no point to this.
SEA:
People aren’t going to tell a friend, or rate and review if I’m not really in it, Carter.
CARTE:
I don’t think that’s necessary. Like we could just say “Hi! We’re the people that perform on the show and use hashtag #OtherBothers if you want to tell other people that they should listen to the show.” Like it’s not really necessary for you to be in the Snegal character.
SEA:
I don’t have to squeeze into this costume every time?
CARTE:
Well I really don’t want to help you anymore Sne… squeeze into this costume. So…
SEA:
You were going to call me Snegal, weren’t you? Oh my God.
CARTE:
(fed up, running with it)
Yeah. Yeah, I was going to call you Snegal because you’re so deep into the character despite not being in the costume. So, it totally works! You’ve done it! You’re in the zone! You are the greatest actor I have ever worked with!
SEA:
(in Snegal’s voice)
Oh my God! I love you. Oh, I worship you! All the time, Evilship! I give you kisses!
(kisses and gleeful laughter)
CARTE:
Okay, that’s great. Except—except Snegal does that to Blat—I’m just Carter.
Silence.
SEA:
(breathless)
Go to patreon.com/albasalix.
CARTE:
Please let go of me. Please just let go.
SEA:
OK.
Music sting.
THE MOUNTAI:
The howling wind returns.
SEA:
And we cut back to a forlorn mountain. We hear the cries of an eagle in the distance, as the wind raises, and the sun is setting. And we see a young and beleaguered Darcy Kimble climbing back up the mountain face. She’s got a long, long way to go. And the camera comes in closer and closer… and Darcy you are maybe a third of the way, working your way back up the hill—the mountain.
MARIS:
Huzzah! So, I made it to the bottom. That’s good news…
All right, so I’m obviously exhausted, and I’m climbing back up, trying to find the safest way to the surface.
SEA:
And it took you hours. Your your arms are trembling as you’re going, and it’s really much harder than you ever imagined. And so, part of you… there’s some voice that’s saying, why? Why do this? Just forget it. Stop.
MARIS:
And I’m inclined to listen to that voice. Except there’s a tiny part of me that says, if I listen to that voice I’ll never get out of this pit. So, I shut off the voice and I just keep moving upwards.
SEA:
The wind is whipping at you and it’s… You’re entering that stage again where you’re fully exposed to the elements and you feel the wind tugging at you and we’re going to do another—we’re going to do another Defy Danger roll.
MARIS:
Uh oh.
Oo! It’s an 11. Really, it’s 12 if I add my Dexterity.
SEA:
So, we cut back to the top, and we see Davinn sort of puttering around muttering,
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Well, that’s one less I have to deal with…
SEA:
(dramatic)
We see an arm come up over the lip… and then we see another arm… and then we see a not-too-happy-looking, drenched-from-sweat Darcy come over the lip.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(grunts of exertion, then panting breaths)
I’m back.
I thought that there was something at the bottom, and that’s why you sent me down there.
I thought perhaps I was going to meet the all-holy, all-knowing, all-seeing Loxsyn, and all would be revealed to me.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Yeah, no.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But at the bottom, there was just a pool of muddy, disgusting water that was really cold. And then I just had to start climbing back up again.
What kind of ridiculous test is this?!
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
(grunts)
Well. Would you like some tea?
Silence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
(growing angry)
No. I’m tired of all the tea in this place. I’ve had enough tea, thank you.
MARIS:
And I get up and I drag myself over and I wring out my extra centaur pant leg over their head, and I say—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I want some answers. What is going on here?!
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
What does Loxsyn mean to you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What does Loxsyn mean to you? What kind of question is that?
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
You agreed to climb down a mountain face, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Because I thought I was going to meet her. I thought it was going to mean something.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
And then you climbed back up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah? Or I would have died down there, probably.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Why didn’t you give up?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Because… that just wasn’t an option! It’s not an option!
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Why?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…Because I need to know. I need to know what’s going on and who Loxsyn is and what’s going on with me and I need to know what you know!
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
That’s a better answer, Darcy.
Pull up… I’d say a chair, but you’ll break it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(weary)
Yeah. Probably.
MARIS:
So then I just collapse on the ground.
SEA:
Okay. And so, we cut to a little bit later and we don’t really hear what’s being said but the camera is moving around this little living space that Davinn has. And we see that Davinn and Darcy are talking, and even laughing once in a while. And Davinn is talking for long periods of time, and at the end of it, Davinn reaches forward and says—
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
So no one will ever answer all your questions, Darcy. It’s about belief. And there’s something in you that believes.
There’s not a lot that believe in Loxsyn anymore. So when you come back I’ll teach you some things. But, I mean… you’ve done enough today.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK.
Thanks, I guess.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
And remember to do what I said with the prayer.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK. Yeah. I think I will.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
I got to get you back.
SEA:
And Davinn snaps their fingers and you slowly this time, but peacefully fade out and you come back and you’re in the classroom.
The wind and campfire fade.
THE KITCHE:
SEA:
OK… and we’re back to…
MIK:
My acid dream?
MARIS:
(laughing)
Yes!
SEA:
Yeah.
MIK:
All right.
MARIS:
(cheerful singing)
Doo doo, do doot doot dah, dah doot dah deet dah deeee!
CARTE:
If you don’t eat me, my life holds no meaning!
The kitchen music returns, this time with a chorus of happy little voices singing: “La la la la la…”
SEA:
We cut suddenly to an insane party. There are cakes dancing, Eggerton is spinning and he’s covered in flour and sugar and he’s wearing like… what would you say is one of those things you wear to not get dirty?
MIK:
An apron?
SEA:
An apron.
Laughter.
MARIS:
Please remember this.
What are those things that you wear to not get dirty? An apron.
CARTE:
Seven minutes of sleep. We’ve established that aprons are worn in the kitchen, and that eagles come in male and female.
SEA:
Sean didn’t get a lot of sleep last night.
And it is a crazy party. Like on the tops of all the cabinets are all other little ingredients, they’re all out. Everything’s out.
MARISA (AS RANDOM INGREDIENTS)
Waow!
SEA:
Every door is open. Everyone’s dancing. There’s apples—maybe not happy. But they’re also moving around. And we’re back with Eggerton and there are massive cakes everywhere.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This is a lot of fun, everybody! Thanks for helping me out… But I was wondering if perhaps one of you wanted to elect maybe, you know, a leader among you who could guide me spiritually through this process, like I’m sure in other processes happens that are less confusing.
SEAN (AS RANDOM INGREDIENTS)
Yay! Whoo!
SEA:
So, all the little sugar cakes are all shouting—
SEAN (AS LITTLE SUGAR CAKES)
Yeah, we’ll be the leader! Elect a leader!
SEA:
And one of the big cakes is like—
SEAN (AS ONE OF THE BIG CAKES)
Oh, that’s a great idea Eggerton.
Pause.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right, so that was… fun.
Maybe you know I should go though and have a nap and try and recover, because you knowthis … it’s been a lot of baking. We’ve had a lot of dancing, it’s been a lot of fun. But you know, you need to take a break, so you know when you’re having fun.
SEA:
And the mixing bowl is like—
SEAN (AS MIXING BOWL)
Maybe you should just lay down in here! Just put your head down while we sing and dance!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That sounds lovely, but I’m not sure that I’ll be able to get too much sleep with everyone singing and dancing.
MARIS:
(singing along)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why is that carrot so noisy? It keeps coming in.
MARISA (AS CARROT)
Yaaaa!
SEA:
So, one of the little cakes jumps right in your mouth.
MIK:
(spit take)
SEA:
It’s like—
MARISA (AS A LITTLE CAKE)
Cowabunga!
SEA:
They’re all running around and screaming and yelling and that’s when you suddenly… wake up.
The singing stops abruptly, leaving only the drums.
SEA:
And you’re in the kitchen and everything is back where it belongs and it’s clean and empty. But you hear that music playing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think… there might be something wrong with this kitchen.
SEAN (AS MIXING BOWL)
Nah, dude.
SEA:
You see this bowl poke out of one of the cabinets.
SEAN (AS MIXING BOWL)
Nah, we’re good here. Really good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you Mr. Mixing Bowl. It’s nice to see you again. When did I fall asleep?
Their voices begin to echo, and the distant harp returns.
SEAN (AS MIXING BOWL)
Ohh… that party, man. We cleaned up for ya. It was good. Don’t forget what you learned!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(deeply confused)
I will never… forget what I learned here today, let me be certain of that in my telling you things.
Now, if I were to try and leave this place where might I go?
SEAN (AS MIXING BOWL)
You’re going back to the classroom, dude.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s nice. But, I’d like to go there. I’m just wondering because I was outside and then I looked into the crack and then I was in here and then there was the dancing and the carrot and the apple and one of them jumped in my mouth and I don’t know how I feel about that. But you know it was good I guess, so…
His voice fades.
THE CLASSROO:
SEA:
Darcy you’re in the classroom again suddenly, a lot in your head, a lot to think about and you hear—picking that up again—you basically slowly hear a voice, going on and on as Eggerton fades into one of the chairs.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…I don’t know where I’m supposed to go now, but the cupcake, I think it was sweet, I don’t know if it’s still going to be OK—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s OK, Bowl—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m just trying to figure this out, Bowl, why do you sound like—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, I’m not a bowl.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why aren’t you a bowl—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sharply)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wha—What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What happened? Why are you calling me a bowl?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh I—there was this—I—you… No, it’s OK. I’m gonna. I’m…
(a small, strangled noise of confusion)
I’m gonna just… sit…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You look like you might have had too many mushrooms or something.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispering)
I don’t know if the mushrooms can hear us. So, let’s try to keep it down, okay?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
Okay.
SEA:
And that’s when Blat explodes into the room, rebounds off the ceiling…
A crackling noise, then the sounds of furniture crashing to the floor.
SEA:
…hits the chalkboard, sends everything flying… His wings are out, and he looks up and he looks a little harried.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(frantic)
I FOUGHT A BIG DEMON!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
THERE WAS A BIG DEMON AND I FOUGHT HIM AND HE SAID CALL YOUR WEAPON AND I DIDN’T HAVE A WEAPON AND I THREW MONEY AND HE SAID YOU CAN MAKE A WEAPON AND I MADE A BAZOOKA AND I KEPT BLOWING HIM UP OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND HE WOULDN’T STOP AND HE TOLD ME WE COULD HAVE TEA AND AFTER TEA I BLEW HIM UP AGAIN AND AGAIN. OH GOD I CAN’T STOP SCREAMING.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did the teacup talk to you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No. What? A teacup?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He’s been talking to things like bowls and teacups and he thinks the mushrooms are talking to him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I’m sorry! Are mushrooms talking to you? I was literally in hell! He cleaved me in half! See this leg? Blown off! Blown completely off! Blood flying everywhere! But I’m sorry, the kitchenware had a conversation with you!
SEA:
There is a knocking at your open door.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Uh… sorry if I’m interrupting anything, everyone.
Moira would like to see you all in the briefing room.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I feel like whenever we see Moira, bad things happen.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Maybe this isn’t a good time?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, perfect time. I’ve learned I can create a bazooka out of thin air. So please, let’s have more exposition as to how we’re all going to die soon.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is there any carrots in that room?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I’m not sure.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How about apples? The apples were pretty mean.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I don’t think there’s any apples in the briefing room.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are there any bowls?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
…Nope. No bowls.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did you look in the drawers, because they can open the drawers themselves…
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I gotta go. I gotta think about my job.

CARTER (AS BLAT)
I FOUGHT A BIG DEMON!
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
You’re in my book, so I must be your teacher. The name is Davinn.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m Darcy.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Yeah, I know.
SEA:
You see the most unbelievably stupendous kitchen you have ever seen in your life.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I WAS LITERALLY IN HELL!
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Come have a cup of tea.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Your name’s Reginald?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe I’ll… make some fairy cakes.
SEAN (AS CHRYSANTHEYUM)
Yeahhh, dude!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I thought perhaps I was going to meet the all-holy, all-knowing, all-seeing Loxsyn, and all would be revealed to me.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
Yeah, no.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
This school’s gone to hell. They used to explain this stuff.
SEA:
The bowl is talking to you, like,
SEAN (AS MIXING BOWL)
Mix me, baby, mix me…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is it possible I had some bad fairy cakes…?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I need to know what’s going on and who Loxsyn is, and I need to know what you know!
SEAN (AS MIXING BOWL)
And don’t forget what you learned.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I will… never forget what I learned here today, let me be certain of that in my telling you things.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
CALL YOUR WEAPON!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
BAZOOKA!
The sound of Blat’s bazooka assembling itself out of metal pieces. The rocket hisses away and explodes.
SEAN (AS DAVINN)
So no one will ever answer all your questions, Darcy. It’s about belief. And there’s something in you that believes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
OH GOD I CAN’T STOP SCREAMING.
The music ends.
TARGET PRACTIC:
SEA:
So a few days go by. And we pop in on our favorite adventurers from time to time.
And so the camera’s going to start by searching, moving from room to room, past an empty classroom, another empty classroom, to the dormitory… and every once in awhile we hear this dull boom! and the building shakes a little. And it’s searching and searching for Blat.
And then we go out a window, behind the school, behind the Academy of the Fallen, and down and down into the back gardens… and we find Blat, hard at work.
Birdsong, and the distant rush of a waterfall.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(putting on various voices)
“Hello, I’m here to destroy time.”
Oh, you’re here to destroy time, eh? Well eat… bazooka!
His bazooka materializes with a clatter of metal parts. He fires a rocket, which hisses away and explodes with a huge boom.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eh heh heh heh… doesn’t get old at all.
“Well, how about if I came to stop time?”
“I also would like to stop time!”
Well, how about stopping… a bazooka shell!
Another rocket and another explosion.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah ha haaa… I gotcha.
A window creaks open.
SEAN (AS ACADEMY NEIGHBOUR)
Excuse me! Is somebody blowing things up out here?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, everything’s just fine, it’s just the occasional… flowers are exploding because of… too much, uh, sunlight.
Laughter.
SEAN (AS ACADEMY NEIGHBOUR)
Oh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Go back into your… window.
SEAN (AS ACADEMY NEIGHBOUR)
OK, just ask the flowers to keep it down a little. We’re sleeping up here!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh yes. Very good. Sorry to disturb you. Keeping the flowers down!
The neighbour shuts the window again.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
“Hello, I’m a flower. I would like to explode.”
Not before I explode you first! Bazooka!
A third rocket zooms off and explodes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah ha ha… you lousy flower.

COOKIN:
SEA:
We’re going to enter through the back door of the kitchen, where we’re going to find Eggerton, hard at work.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You think you can talk to me that way, flower? Well, let me show you what happens to a flower who talks back. Hozzah! Fairy cake! Ha ha ha!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Can I help?
SEA:
So Snegal comes running up around the corner and he dumps down the things you asked for, he’s like—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Now Snegal do what? Snegal help!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, Snegal, perfect timing! Could you perchance fetch me the fairy dust from the third drawer to the left on the second side of the upside up there.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Uhhh… OK!
SEA:
And Snegal sort of scurries off.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And while I wait for you I’m going to go look out his window and… Hey, what happened to that flower that was there earlier? Huh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(indistinct shouting in the distance)
Yeah, that’s right! You’re gonna take this, you lousy flower!
A distant boom.
SEA:
Snegal comes scurrying back and drops a bunch of like, peppercorns across the counter.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal got the fairy… stuff.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent, Snegal! That is… not at all what I asked for but will work just fine. We will do a spicy fairy cake! And perhaps this one will also help clear the sinuses, while bringing love to others.
Now Snegal, would you like to see the magical step of infusing it with love?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Uhhh…. No.
Silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m glad that we are in a world where we all agree and add on to the last thought to help build the story, Snegal!
MARIS:
(uncontrollable laughter)
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Does Blat like fairy cake?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat has not yet experienced a fairy cake. Though I imagine that Blat would like one should his bazooka, uh, happen to backfire.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Make fairy cake! Let’s make fairy cake! Snegal ready!
A familiar jazz drumbeat starts up.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, well, if we’re making one for Blat, let’s get the chili flakes down from the second shelf on the left in the inside of the cupboard to the right.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh yeah. Got it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent. And Mr. Sugar Cup! How are you today?
The music stops. Silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent, Mr. Sugar Cup!
The drums start up once again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know why all of you stopped talking to me after I spent those days in the book. But it’s just as well, I prefer to be the one talking sometimes.
SEA:
Snegal comes back with a thing of butter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you for the… chili flakes.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh yes! Snegal get… make a fairy cake for Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This pleather butter will do quite well for the treats for Blat. And we will put it in the bowl—how are you Mr. Bowl? I haven’t heard from you in a few days either…
Silence.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Am I Mr. Bowl?
The drums start once again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No Mr. Bowl is my friend here who once talked to me quite extensively, and he sounded like he had had a few fairy cakes but when I tried to show people that Mr. Bowl would talk to me he stopped talking to me. And I think maybe I offended him when I called him Mr. Bowl, because maybe he’s a Mrs. Bowl or a “they” Bowl. I don’t know, I…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Are we making fairy cake for Blat?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. We’re making the fairy cake for Blat. So what we do is we put all of these ingredients—the pleather butter, which looks sort of like chili flakes in some way, and we put that in with the cracked corn, which looks sort of like the fairy dust…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Uh huh…
There’s another muffled boom.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We add the flour. And what was that sound from outside?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Make fairy cake for Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent. Right. So we will go back to making the fairy cake. And we add flour, and then—close your eyes. Close your eyes.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
OK. Snegal close eyes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Now we say: “We love everyone and want everyone to be happy.”
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal loves Blat, wants Blat be happy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And we stick it in the oven for 43 minutes and 72 seconds.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Too long! Snegal need fairy cake now!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s kind of a fairy—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
NOW!
SEA:
And before you can say or do anything, Eggerton, you catch Snegal out of the corner of your eye, leaping onto the counter, scooping his fist down into the bowl, grabbing a bunch of the batter, laughs at you—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Hee ha ha ha!
SEA:
—and then zips out the back door.
The door opens. We hear the birds in the garden.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(running off)
Thank you Eggles! Got to find His Evilship!
MEDITATIO:
SEA:
So the camera leaves Eggerton in the kitchen. And we go down the hall to the large stairwell, and we begin spiraling our way up, past the second floor and up to the top of the third floor, where we find Darcy Kimble standing, and staring up at the stairs that go past the third floor of a third floor building.
MARIS:
So, Darcy has been wandering around trying to find a place of peace and quiet, but it seems pretty difficult because outside she keeps hearing these loud booms.
Yet another distant explosion.
MARIS:
And… so she sees the stairs that she hasn’t been up yet, and she thinks, well, there’s got to be somewhere quiet up there. So she starts up these stairs, wherever they may lead.
SEA:
So, as you go up the stairs, Darcy, you go basically another turn and a half of the stairs and there’s just a little door, and it’s about three and a half feet high and has a little handle on it.
MARIS:
OK. So, I lift the handle and I open the door and I bend down to go through.
She opens the door. Birdsong and soft, tranquil music.
SEA:
You step out into the most unbelievably beautiful garden you’ve ever seen.
Now, the gardens in Balgomar were perfect. Everything, every blade had been manicured and touched. This is the exact opposite. It is so wild and chaos and yet there’s this strange beauty, like everything works and fits together. And it is basically from the door forward all the way to the end of the building. The gardens cover the entire top of the Academy of the Fallen.
MARIS:
So… Darcy finds this remarkable because the idea of vegetation on roofs is something that never would have occurred to her living in Balgomar. And she wanders through it. She’s looking at all the different flowers—
SEA:
There’s little paths that break off and weave, and there’s little places where there’ll just be a bench to sit. And while you can still hear the roar of a bazooka in the distance, it’s somehow muffled up here. And you could easily get lost, and yet it doesn’t feel like a labyrinth, it’s just this series of turns and paths and seating places.
MARIS:
So she wanders down one of the winding paths, and she comes to a place where there’s a little pond that has a little mini waterfall going into it…
A small, gentle waterfall.
MARIS:
And she feels strangely at peace, which she hasn’t felt for a long time now. And she thinks back to what the strange teacher told her about meditating, which she isn’t all that comfortable with, but she thinks, well, this is as good a time as any…
And she sits down by the water and she… traces one of her fingers into it and it’s pleasantly warm. And her eyes just start to close a bit.
A haunting melody on a flute-like instrument.
MARIS:
And the stone that she’s got on a cord around her neck starts to glow this faint blue, and it keeps getting stronger as her breathing slows… and suddenly it’s like she can hear the water trickling, but really clearly, and there’s grasses waving in the wind and she can hear that…
The flute is joined by a wordless female voice. The other sounds fade, with the waterfall lingering until last.
MARIS:
And the sound of the loud booming just recedes into nothingness, so she can’t hear that at all. All she can hear is her own breathing… and she just starts to meditate.
SEA:
And the camera slowly pulls back through the brush. And yet we can always see Darcy, there by the pond on the top of the roof… and it’s as if time has stopped for a second for Darcy.
And that’s when we see Darcy’s eyes open suddenly—
A soft chime and the music stops.
SEA:
Because she just heard one word spoken in her mind.
A long, expectant silence, broken finally by:
CARTE:
Cheesecake.
Laughter.
The music returns and swells, led by the wordless singing.
SEA:
Your eyes fly open. And you heard this most beautiful voice in the world, say…
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Cheesecake.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
And it is a beautiful feminine voice. And as you open your eyes with that word, you see that the necklace you’re wearing is glowing so brightly that it’s like a sun on your neck, lighting everything up… and slowing dimming.
The music fades as well, and the sound of the birds returns.
MARIS:
And she just can’t believe it. She’s never experienced anything like it, and… she’s just amazed. But also now has a craving for cheesecake, and so gets up and heads down toward the kitchen—a little disappointed that the first words she heard in her meditation was a baked good… but just going with it.
FAIRY CAK:
SEA:
The camera pulls away from the roof and slowly comes down to the back as we see a fireball roar up past us…
Boom.
SEA:
And we see Snegal running out of the back door the kitchen, and searching around hectically, trying to find Blat.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(impish grunts and mumbles)
Oh… got to give the cake to Blat… Where is the Blat? Are you Blat? Nooo…
Oh hi, flower. Who are you? Do you know where Blat is, flower? No? OK. Hide you? Snegal hide you.
SEA:
And so Snegal picks the flower and tucks it under his arm, and continues to run around looking for Blat.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blat? Blat? Blat, are you out here?
(gasps as he hears:)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry, my friend, but only one of us is going to be able to… save time!
Bazooka!
A rocket hisses and detonates with a huge boom.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(screams)
Aaaaaaa!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(screams)
Oh! Oh no!
Pandemonium. Fire crackles as they both scream madly.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I’m on fire!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh no! I’m sorry!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I’m on fire!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m so sorry!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(abruptly stops screaming)
Oh no, I like it. Hahaha! I haven’t been on fire in a long time!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(nervous, relieved laughter)
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Woooo! Look at it go! Look at my tail! I can make—watch it when I spin it.
A fiery whooshing sound.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s… great…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I can make trails. Wooo!
I brought you—oh, it’s a little overcooked now… I brought you fairy cake.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A fairy…
Again… I think that perhaps that you think because of my appearance that I’m some sort of demonic overlord here in—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
LORD!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no!
SEA:
He grabs your feet.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You… wait! You no Snegal’s Evilship?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I’m just making an assumption that you, with your limited form of education, believes that I’m some sort of superior being. The era that I come from we do not have…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal not good enough?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, that’s not quite what I’m saying… it’s—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Snegal improve! You watch! Me get you many more cakes. Me get you less cooked cake!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eh… Wait a moment. Is this one of the cakes Eggerton keeps talking about?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Uh… No?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(disappointed)
Oh, it isn’t.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It is, then!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
No?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, just give me the cake.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes, sir.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ahhh… I’ve always wanted to try one of these. He keeps going on and on about how magical the fairy cakes are…
SEA:
Snegal is just watching you with utter, rapt attention.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And I have been wanting to try one of these for quite some time.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You have?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So… I don’t expect you to be my servant, but I do thank you for bringing this to me.
And now, the so-called ambrosia of the fairy gods… the fairy cake!
Silence as he tries it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(spits it out violently)
PFAH! Oh my—ugh!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, that is terrible! What is in this?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Uh… Snegal help!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Are these peppers?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Maybe? No!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What kind of a fairy cake is this?!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Uh… Snegal get you better cake!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I should hope so! I was raised on half-demonic food but even I think this is a bit too spicy for my liking!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal sorry! Snegal fix!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, I—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal fix! Snegal fix!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, here! Take it! Go away!
SEA:
Snegal dashes off.
And literally it’s like the Road Runner—he’s like back, shoom!
A whoosh and a cartoonish twang!
SEA:
And he’s holding Eggerton’s whole pouch, the fairy pouch, and it’s not even undone. It’s just the entire pouch that he had around his waist, and he’s opening it and he holds up—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Many fairy cake here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m not going to ask how this happened.
All right. Let’s try one of—
(instantly in rapture)
—ohhhh, my goodness me.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Huh?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhh, that’s a good time. What is happening to my taste buds? My tongue is dancing within my mouth and my tonsils are here to greet it. Ohhh!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Is it good?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Good is an understatement, my small uneducated friend. This… is the finest foodstuff that I have ever tasted.
SEA:
Roll Fairy Cakes, Michael…
MIK:
That is a 6 + Wisdom… That is a 7.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIK:
So, they heal for d8 but with a cost.
SEA:
Yep. So roll a d8, Carter.
Carter rolls.
SEA:
So you get 4+…
CARTE:
Well, that’s pretty good.
SEA:
OK, so you get 5 hit points back.
CARTE:
Cool.
SEA:
And you are high as a kite.
Laughter.
SEA:
With a bazooka…
MARIS:
Oh no…
SEA:
In the backyard.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal, uh—would you like keep all pouch?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(slurring his words)
I would like to keep the pouch.
SEA:
Okay, so Snegal hands you the pouch.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Good. Now!
CARTE:
Yes, sir?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m gonna show you something really special.
I have found out from a demonic overlord that I have the power to create future weaponry.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Huh?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Would you like to see more future weaponry?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(clapping excitedly)
Snegal yes! Snegal yes!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Excellent! So, which of these trees do you like the least?
Laughter.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! The one on the left is mean. Very mean to Snegal.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, the one on my left will feel my rage! Bazooka!
A hiss and a boom.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(ecstatic)
Woooo! It’s on fire! Wooo!
Snegal on fire too!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(panicking)
Oh! Oh!
(realizes)
Oh. Wait… Is this another one of those tricks that you’re actually okay with fire because you’re actually…?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yeah! Hahaha!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Ha ha…
All right. Now, if you don’t mind, Blat’s just going to lie down here for a moment…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You put head on Snegal. Snegal keep soft… soft belly!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Seems a little forward, but, uh… well… whatever you feel is the best thing to do—
Snegal, have Looked at your hands? I mean, really looked at your hands, and wonder that everyone’s got hands, but everyone’s hands are different than everyone else’s. We’re all the same, yet we’re all different.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
S… Snegal confused!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Snegal… don’t be confused.
Because I love you, Snegal. I love you so—you’re my good friend, Snegal. And I don’t want to hear you argue the point.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(too overcome to speak; tiny, incoherent sounds of elation)
CARTER (AS BLAT )
That’s right. Here—for you, Snegal.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Me?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Here is my dry cleaner coupon.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Wha?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If you go—
SEA:
He takes it—like, he’s caressing it in between his hands as he takes it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Another two trips and you can have a shirt done for free… which you don’t appear to wear. Maybe you should start.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Shirt. Snegal get shirt. OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal pillow.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(losing consciousness)
Great.
SEA:
He’s like, caressing your hair.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal pillow…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just gonna… lie down and… not freak out.
Carter’s head hits the table with a thud.
Laughter.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(singing softly)
Oh, Blat… Snegal friend, first friend… sleep, first friend, Snegal only friend…
(mutters, suddenly distracted)
Tasty ear—leave ear alone…
(singing)
Snegal friend…
The scene fades out.

Field log 7.1. Minimal corruption in this timestream. Mission success. I located Subject Bravo, tracked him to his place of work. At initiation of early onset of event, subject fled to the top floor of his building, where I was able to apprehend, subdue, and bag-and-tag using a beetle.
I’m moving on to Subject Delta.
Beep.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Field log 8.2. As previously stated, I entered this timestream at an earlier point. It is the 22nd day of the 32nd year of Boltius.
All beetles report temporal lock, but fluctuations are increasing. I located Subject Delta and have tracked.
Last night there was an altercation. She was accosted by three individuals who may be under the influence of corruption. I was unable to ascertain their status, as they were… taken care of on my arrival. It happened at an alley, and as I moved to approach the alley I heard sounds of battle. On my arrival, Subject Delta was not present and the three individuals were… no longer breathing.
I have since lost track of Subject Delta, and while I want to continue tracking, the fluctuations give me pause. So I am jumping time streams to Subject Echo and will update shortly.
Beep.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Field log 9.0. I located Subject Echo easily, however, the corruption is rampant in this timestream. Multiple agents were encountered. A few were in the final feet of trying to reach Subject Echo. He appeared oblivious to me even as I eliminated two agents, stepped into his room, tranquilized and bag-and-tagged him.
The Grissom beetle took over 30 seconds to get temporal lock. It’s not a good sign. I’m going to attempt to return immediately to Subject Delta, if I’m able.
My injuries are minor. I am able to proceed.
Beep.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Field log 10.1, local time approximately 11 AM, the 23rd day of the 32nd year of Boltius in this timestream.
Fluctuations are increasing, signs of corruption abound. Multiple agents spotted at the workplace of Subject Delta. Subject Delta has recently arrived. I am tracking. Very little time. Further update to follow.
Beep.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Field log 14.1. I was able to return to the timestream for Subject Charlie. The Grissom beetle is now losing local temporal sync completely. Transport likely to be no longer possible. Repeat: transport likely to be no longer possible.
Unable to find Subject Charlie. No appearances at residence or work. Widening my search.
Beep.
A rumble, like rolling thunder under Greg’s voice. The signal cuts out more frequently.
SEAN (AS GREG)
I’m not sure why I’m continuing to leave these. The beetles haven’t had sync in days, so it’s likely this will never be received.
I am still in timestream of Subject Charlie. Agents swarm the streets, eyes as black as night.
I’ve managed to secure access to a rooftop and bar entry from below. The temporal inconsistencies are almost visible.
The end is approaching. This is where I will make my final stand.
I pray the three I reached made it back.
Give my love to Ananka and… may the Nexus prevail.
Beep.
MIDROLL: HELLO THE TWITTE:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCER (ELI)
(hums the bassline)
It’s the beginning of middle of The End of Time… and Other Bothers.
MIK:
(off mic)
Didn’t Marisa know we’re recording a midroll? Where is she?
SNEGA:
Hello…
MIK:
(sighs)
You’re not Marisa.
SNEGA:
Hello?
MIK:
OK.
(resigned)
So once again we’d like to thank you for listening to the End of Time and Other Bothers.
SNEGA:
I not Marisa!
MIK:
Yeah, I’m… painfully aware of that, Snegal.
SNEGA:
Me Snegal!
MIK:
Right. So, just a reminder that you can review this episode and any future episodes on iTunes. This is a brand new show, and we really need to get the word out.
SNEGA:
Hello iTune!
MIK:
Yeah, sure. Hi, iTunes. You can also spread the word with our hashtag #OtherBothers to let everyone following you on Twitter know about us and the hardships that we go through working on this show.
SNEGA:
Hello the Twitter!
MIK:
Eli, I don’t know that I can do this.
EL:
(off mic)
You’re doing great.
SNEGA:
Michael, why the Twitter not say hello back?
MIK:
$2 Patreon supporters get early access to episodes along with other perks.
SNEGA:
(in the background)
Twitter! Twitter!
MIK:
Click on over to Patreon.com/AlbaSalix and maybe there will be an explanation on why I have to record these spots with a deranged non-player character.
SNEGA:
Wait, the Twitter! Hello, Twitter! Are you under here? Twitter? Hello!
MIK:
Twitter isn’t a person.
SNEGA:
It’s not?
MIK:
It’s a social media website where people can talk about our show and… I don’t know, a billion other things. Do you understand that?
SNEGA:
Ohh. Twitter not here because… Snegal here.
MIK:
Yeah, sure. You’re recording with me instead of Twitter.
SNEGA:
(gasps)
Snegal better than Twitter?
MIK:
Well… actually, you know what, most days that’s not necessarily wrong.
Music sting.
THE LIBRAR:
SEA:
We open in the center of the Nexus, in the library, which is a very large well-lit room with rows and rows of shelving and books that actually branch off in innumerable corridors in every direction you look.
Moira is standing in the center of the room in front of a large table, and she is speaking as if to the air.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Ananka. I know you can hear me. I think it’s time we had a talk.
Silence.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Maybe we could do that in person, Ananka?
A magical flutter and boom.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Finally.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(sighs)
What is it, Moira?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
What are you doing?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I know what I am doing. Sometimes I am not quite sure where I am in time. You know this about me. So maybe my calculation was little bit off. But ultimately my instincts are never wrong.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
A little a bit off? Ananka, we’re 60 years off!
SEA:
And she throws the papers off the table.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
60 years, Ananka! We’re behind now!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
But a drop. Time it flows like the water. This is just a few drops—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Don’t give me the drops, Ananka. You don’t believe that either. I know about Greg.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(inhales sharply)
Do not talk about Greg.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
That was supposed to be a one-way trip. We agreed.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No, we did not agree. That was your plan. That was never my plan.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
They’re not ready, Ananka. These three you believe so much in, they’re plebes. They’re not even in proper training and we’re now behind.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Moira, I have faith in these three. Do you remember? Us three sisters—you myself and Tekmor? Nobody believed we could handle this. We could handle being at the Nexus. Yet here we are.
Silence.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
What if we’re not ready either, Ananka? We’re making this up as we go. All I have is… is your visions.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
You have to trust in that. If there’s nothing else you can trust in, you must trust in my vision.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(deep breath)
We have to start them. We’re too far behind now. Find me a story, a story that’s going to be… safe. Something simple.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I have just the one.
CHEESECAK:
SEA:
We arrive back into the kitchen just at the moment that Eggerton realizes that he no longer is wearing pants or a pouch… and Darcy enters, looking for a very specific cheesecake.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton… What are you doing?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I appear to not be wearing pants… But more concerning, my pouch is missing. I don’t remember taking my—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Could you please get some pants? Put something on.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I—OK, I had a pouch and I don’t have the pouch now, but the pouch has my fairy cakes. And I think there’s a special connection now, because the fairy cakes always—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think there’s a hygiene issue here with you being in a kitchen like this. Seriously.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I… I do imbue my fairy cakes with love and—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Please go and get yourself pants now, or find your own pants.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait, wait, I can see the pants over there by the doorway, so… I’m gonna go over there, could you—I’m going to bend down and pick them up. Could you turn around, please? I mean, I’m—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. Yeah. OK. No problem.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are you turned around?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m turned around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did you turn around?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m turned around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m going to bend over and pick them up. Don’t look over.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Don’t look over.
SEA:
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. You can look now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why aren’t you wearing pants?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know. I was wearing pants before. I was also wearing my pouch before. Now I don’t have my pouch and my pouch is very important to me because it has all the fairy cakes—
SEA:
You hear the voice again in your head. It rings out. You see the necklace that Darcy is wearing glow—the brightest light you’ve ever seen. Very mesmerizing and beautiful. You hear the voice again—
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Cheesecake.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I would help you look for your pouch, Eggerton… and I will help you look for your pouch, but…
I have a real strong craving for some cheesecake. Which—do you make that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I make the best pleather cheesecake in all of Balgoria!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well that’s perfect. That’s the best kind. That’s the kind I want.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. Now, you may see some dancing sugar, so I don’t want you to be alarmed when that happens.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sure. Sure, Eggerton, I won’t be alarmed by the dancing sugar.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. OK.
The jazzy drums return.
MIK:
So Eggerton walks over to the the cupboards… and in his head the music starts up—
MARIS:
(cheerful singing)
MIK:
—and he starts bopping around and pulling things out of drawers, and tossing things in the mixing bowl, and spinning it, and throws it into a stone oven and… you know, the sun kind of skips forward a little bit while we wait.
SEA:
Yup. And you start to smell you something really good, Darcy.
MARIS:
And Darcy is actually quite impressed with the agility and dexterity that Eggerton moves around the kitchen and creates these wondrous things.
SEA:
It is a little strange the way he has conversations with the mixing bowl.
MARIS:
Yes, she’s ignoring that at this point.
MIK:
He does have reasonably average dexterity, it should be pointed out.
MARIS:
But maybe above average in the kitchen.
MIK:
(softly)
Hey. I feel ya.
SEA:
(laughs)
MIK:
So, a little ding goes off.
Ding! The drums stop.
MIK:
And he walks over to the oven and with quick hands, patting it back and forth, he pulls out a pan and plops it down and says—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Pleather cheesecake!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh… that smells so good, Eggerton.
(gasps)
And you put in chili flakes and peppercorns! I loved that back home!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I had a few leftover from an earlier recipe.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, that just… OK, OK…
MARIS:
And I get out a knife and I cut myself a slice. And I just—which is not usually how Darcy eats—but she just picks it up with her hands and she just, as her necklace glows even brighter, she just shoves it into her mouth in one big piece.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(undignified gulping sounds)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s… that’s impressive in itself.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(in delight)
Oh, it’s so good Eggerton.
The soft music from Darcy’s meditation returns, growing more intense by the second.
SEA:
The amulet that Darcy is wearing just gets brighter and brighter—it’s painfully bright, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shouting)
I don’t know if you know this, but your necklace has gotten kind of bright and it is starting to cause sunburns on my skin… my rosy cheeks are turning a little dark, and it’s hurting and cracking now…
SEA:
And Darcy, you barely hear any of this that’s going on in the room, Darcy, because before you… you see Loxsyn.
The haunting melody plays.
SEA:
Gleaming beams of white light flying all around the room, and you just know that it’s her.
And she’s finishing pushing cheesecake into her mouth, and she smiles at you. And your brain… it’s like lightning going through your brain… and then she’s gone.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
Sweet Loxsyn.
SEA:
And you now have—and you don’t know how you know it—but you know you’ve been granted magical spells and powers.
MARIS:
And then the amulet slowly fades down to nothing… and Darcy looks down at the floor where Eggerton is passed out from blinding light.
The music fades.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton? Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(a frightened, half-asleep mumble)
Aaaaa it’s a bright light…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did you… did you see that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You shove a huge piece of pleather cheesecake into your mouth and swallow it without chewing? Yes, I saw that…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did you see the other woman who did that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, you did that and I’m pretty sure I remember another woman doing that at the same time because it was, you know… I think you may have unhinged your jaw a little bit…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, it does feel a little sore.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s clicking a bit as you talk.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I… I’m just going to go back to my room now…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But we need—we need to get my fairy pouch.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(in a daze)
Oh yeah. I did say I’d help with that…
OK, why don’t you lead the way, Eggerton, and I’ll help you with that.
AWAKENIN:
SEA:
So, we follow Darcy and Eggerton as they look around the kitchen for a while. Darcy just waiting while Eggerton checks every cupboard.
The sound of birds and the distant waterfall in the backyard.
SEA:
And then we follow them outside as they invariably find themselves standing in front of a passed-out Blat, whose head is resting on Snegal’s belly while Snegal slowly runs his hands through Blat’s hair.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(whispers)
Oh… Blat sleeping.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(with barely-contained fury)
Blat.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
No! Blat sleeping!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wake him up, you little imp.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(worried)
Oh…
SEA:
And you see that Blat is currently holding, in one hand, your fairy pouch.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
He’s got it! He’s got it! OK, I’m gonna…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(softly)
Sir? Sir? Sir…
SEA:
So Snegal starts, like, tapping your eyelid.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Sir? Sir—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(awakening with a start, blurts)
Aa! Football practice!
SEA:
(laughs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! What—what are you doing?!
MARIS:
And you start to see these… that Darcy’s hair is getting really straight up now, and the spikes are actually standing straight up from her head, which isn’t normal for her.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sober again)
I was just practicing the bazooka… and that’s really all I—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat. That tree is destroyed! This was a beautiful garden and you destroyed that tree. Look at all these flowers! How could you just do that?!
SEA:
And that’s when you start to notice that Darcy’s eyes have changed color. They are a gleaming, animal-like yellow.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(cowed)
I’m… I’m very sorry; I didn’t realize that the tree and the flowers were so important. I tried to pick an area without too many people around, since I wanted to test the bazooka power that—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You don’t just use this Centurion weapon to take out nature and everything that’s around you! You have to be more careful with it!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel that I’m all… practiced up, so I shan’t be doing that again, that’s—not to worry—and maybe now your hair will lie down and your eyes will return to its original color… Eggerton! Might I speak to you just over here for a moment?
MARIS:
And as soon as Blat makes those comments, Darcy subconsciously puts her hand to her amulet… and the eyes start to fade back to her green, and the hair does come down a bit. And she stumbles away a bit, away from the two of them as if she’s embarrassed.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are these bunnies over here saying “What are we going to have for dinner now,” Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um… Perhaps we can, um, give them a fairy cake from this pouch that I… seem to have on my person.
Goose goose! Hello! Here you go. Fairy cakes all around…
MARIS:
(laughs)
“Goose goose.”
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(excited noises)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No no, not you!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Fairy cake! Snegal like fairy cake! I share with rabbit—come back rabbit! Come back, rabbit!
His voice fades into the distance.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think I’ll hold on to that pouch for now.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, I am terribly sorry. I’m not sure how I got a hold of this, so here you are; I return that to you… and I just want to tell you that I’m not quite sure what happened, but I think I may have had sex with Snegal.
Laughter.

Ananka, we’re 60 years off!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Does Blat like fairy cake?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We will do a spicy fairy cake!
MARIS:
And she just… starts to meditate.
SEA:
You heard this most beautiful voice in the world say…
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Cheesecake.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This the finest foodstuff that I have ever tasted.
SEA:
And you are high as a kite. With a bazooka. In the back yard.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I make the best pleather cheesecake in all of Balgoria.
MARIS:
She just shoves it into her mouth.
SEA:
You see Loxsyn and she smiles at you—and you know you’ve been granted magical powers.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(slurring his words)
I love you Snegal. You’re my good friend, Snegal. Here’s my dry cleaner coupon.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(too overcome to speak; tiny, incoherent sounds of elation)
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Moira, I have faith in these three.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Could you turn around please?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No problem.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are you turned around?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m turned around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are you turned around?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m turned around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, I’m going to bend over to pick them up, don’t look over.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(singing softly)
First friend, sleep, first friend…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
We have to start them. We’re too far behind now. Find me a story story that’s going to be safe. Something simple.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I have just the one.
The music ends.
ARRIVA:
A roaring sound, as of three hapless adventurers being hurled through time and space.
SEA:
You guys all step through the portal and the world explodes into light—not dissimilar from the experience you had before, Darcy.
For some of you, you were asleep during this experience, so as you are taking a single step it’s as if all time explodes into that single moment. And then as quickly or as long as that seems to last… you step onto hard ground.
It takes a little while for your senses to catch up to you.
Violins play a soft, soothing harmony.
SEA:
You’re standing, all three of you, in a lush valley leading up to a storybook castle that’s not that far off. It’s the foliage that really captures you. It’s a green deeper and more lush and more varied than any of you have ever seen even in Farloria, where you just were. The sky is just as vibrant. But there are two mountain peaks on each side of you, coming up out of and making this valley.
Only there’s a strange silence… that’s broken by this squishing sound.
The music turns eerie.
SEA:
It’s coming from some corpses just ahead of you in the muddy ground. A slightly disfigured head rises from one of the corpses and its mouth opens wider than should be possible. Flesh hangs from its exposed manlike form as it lets out a moan and starts to rise. And you see other heads popping up out of other corpses.
Zombie-like groans.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…Oh geez.
Theme music plays.

Episode 6: The Riddle, Part 1.
SPEAK WITH DEA:
The zombies groan.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m out.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Good luck to you—I’ll simply continue walking in this direction until I find something that isn’t terrifying. A good day to you!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat, hold up! They said this will be easy. We just have to figure out how to get to that castle, I guess, in the distance.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s very simple, yes. You go to the magical storybook castle by, oh, just having a little interaction with the undead!
A good day to you!
SEA:
So the creatures are now, three of them have stood and are moaning as they shamble towards you—
(moaning sound)
And their flesh is hanging off of their bones, they’re sort of grey, like decomposing and they’re shambling towards you. And they’re stumbling over those bodies—which are tripping them up a little and they’re heading your way. They’re only about 25, 30 feet away.
MARIS:
OK. I have a spell called Speak With Dead. Do these things count as dead?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
These are ghouls, are they not? Flesh-eating. Perhaps not the undead…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You think they want a fairy cookie?
SEA:
Yes, this would qualify as dead.
MARIS:
OK. So can I use Speak With Dead?
SEA:
Sure. What’s it say?
MARIS:
It says, “A corpse converses with you briefly. It will answer any three questions you pose to it to the best of the knowledge it had in life and the knowledge it gained in death.”
SEA:
OK, so you’re going to cast a spell?
MARIS:
Yes.
SEA:
What do we see happening when you cast a spell? Anything?
A cold wind begins to blow.
MARIS:
I think my hair just stands on and a little bit more than it usually would and my eyes glow a little yellower. But I think that’s about it. It’s fairly subtle.
SEA:
OK, the rest of you see these—whatever they are, disfigured flesh-eating things—pause. And they all swivel their heads onto Darcy and they’re just frozen, staring at Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, excuse me… Um…
What is this place?
MARIS:
Darcy looks confusedly at her two companions, thinking maybe that wasn’t the best first question.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Good. We’ll find out—
SEAN (AS A ZOMBIE)
Brains… must eat brains.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think they’re going to have much to contribute.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I would like to keep my brains please.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ms. Darcy, could we keep my brains?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I can only speak with them! I can’t do anything else.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, could you maybe ask them if they would prefer someone else’s brains over mine?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK. OK OK.
Can the fairy keep his brains?
SEAN (AS A ZOMBIE)
…The whaaat?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey, maybe they do understand.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh great. They’re both dead and very stupid.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, wait. I just have one last question. It’s got to be a good one. Um…
Is there a way around you to the castle?
Music: a sinister, pulsing bass note.
SEA:
Suddenly their voice changes and you notice their eyes go completely black… as if for a second you feel like the light and the green around you is being sucked into their eyes. It’s this weird flash you get.
And you hear a different voice say—
The voice is deep and echoes unnaturally.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Who are you?
…Interesting.
Kill them all.
SEA:
And then it snaps out.
And they all start shambling forward toward you—UNGHHHH—reaching out…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we’re in trouble.
SEA:
And what do you guys do?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m going to climb a tree.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
OK. You’re gonna run for a tree.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Actually, Darcy… join our small companion in tree climbing. I believe I have an idea. Try to get as far away from the shambling undead as possible.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, that’s fine with me!
MARIS:
And I scramble up the best I can up the tree after Eggerton.
SEA:
OK, so I’m going to say you guys don’t need to roll—they’re not that close yet. You guys run for a tree, each of you. Same tree, different tree?
MARIS:
Same tree.
MIK:
Oh yeah. We need to stick together for moral support.
SEA:
They’re madly scrambling for a tree and Blat, what are we doing?
They’re about ten feet away shambling towards you. They’re past the corpses now.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Once again… I must remove my shirt.
CARTE:
Blat slowly begins unbuttoning his shirt, folding it neatly, and placing it on the ground. He unfurls his wings and flies up into the air.
Once I get about say 30 feet above them I call the bazooka.
SEA:
(laughing)
OK, so I gotta say there’s a Defy Danger involved, because they’re getting closer and closer. So I just see the zombie—UGHHHH—and you’re like carefully unbuttoning the shirt, folding it on the ground. Let’s roll Defy Danger, please, as you attempt to leap into the air at the last second.
Carter rolls.
AL:
Oooooo.
CARTE:
That’s a 3.
SEA:
OK. So you go to carefully set the shirt down you turn and are about to leap into the air when one of them just like latches right onto you—UNGHHHH.
So you basically don’t even get fully airborne. You’re sort of dragging one with you backwards.
What you want to do?
CARTE:
Well, after screaming very loudly, I believe Blat’s first option would be to try to kick the zombie hanging onto his leg furiously in the face.
SEA:
OK, let’s roll an Attack roll. You get +1 to Dex. I’ll give you that since you’re half in the air.
CARTE:
All right. It’s an 11!
SEA:
All right! So that is a pure success. Tell me what happens.
CARTE:
Well, I simply kick him once in the face. Perhaps part of his jawbone comes off because it’s quite brittle and he drops down to the ground amongst his shambling companions.
SEA:
I’ll say you rolled so well that the second one of them drops down onto the one that fell, and starts eating him. The third one, however, keeps coming for you as you lift into the air.
CARTE:
Well, hopefully all three of them are now sort of in the same general area, so I’ll call my bazooka and then aim for the centre of the little group.
SEA:
Call for bazooka. Do it, give me the call!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
SEA:
And so a bazooka begins to flow right into your hand, the trigger right under your finger… the screen pops up and you centre it on the zombies and… Give me a roll. A Volley roll.
CARTE:
That’s an 8…
SEA:
+1.
CARTE:
+1, that’s a 9.
SEA:
That’s a partial success. So… You basically blast it, right, and you guys hear this roar as the jet kicks out and steam coming off of it as it fires down at them… But it also blasts you backwards, and you see Blat flipping head over heels, off into the forest where you—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sailing off into the distance)
I regret nothingggg!
Crash.
SEA:
And roll your damage.
CARTE:
4 points of damage!
SEA:
So it is a blast radius… So you guys hear a whump! And you see fire roar up out where the zombies were and that was what, a 4?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think he got ’em.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think you’re right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You should go check.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What? Why don’t you go check?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because I’m above you on the tree.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right.
MARIS:
And I start carefully crawling down the tree to the ground.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you think Blat’s OK?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! Do you think he’s OK?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m sure he’s fine.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK. Good.
SEA:
OK. So Darcy you see roaring embers. You smell cooking flesh. Very old flesh…
MARIS:
So I ascertain that the zombies are down.
SEA:
Oh yeah it’s just, like, there’s a little bit of movement in the pile, but not really…
MARIS:
So I yell out to Eggerton,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s safe now! You can come down.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK.
MIK:
And I start climbing down. Which I’m not going be very good at.
SEA:
So Blat, you crash into the top of a tree.
Crashing and thuds as Blat tumbles down from branch to branch.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Gah…
Ugh…
Ungh…
Gaghhh…
Ugh. I think I’m safe now—
Aghhh.
Laughter.
SEA:
You hit the ground, and you take 1 hit point of damage from—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Aghh.
SEA:
…from that fall.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve cut myself on brambles.
I have bark in my pants.
Laughter.
SEA:
You can hear Darcy and Eggerton, they’re not that far away. You basically can smell burning flesh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Where are you? Are you all right?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m fine. I meant to do what I did in the tree.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well you got them! You did a good job!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes… I’ve… eviscerated dead people. Now, let us sally forth to the storybook castle which appears to be at a time further in the past than when we were. A few more of these missions and perhaps we could witness the dawn of the universe. Jim dandy! I’m having a quite a time.
SEA:
You guys see Blat step out of the foliage. He’s dragging a bunch of like, briars and trying to untangle his—he looks quite good without his shirt, with his wings out.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Could someone please hand me my shirt.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I have some bad news for you, Blat. It was incinerated along with the zombies.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ahh, the blast radius. I didn’t…
(sighs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. But hey! Don’t worry about it, you might need your wings again, really soon.
CARTE:
Blat opens his wings out and crosses them in front of him, trying to hide as much of himself as he can. He’s basically a head sticking out above wrapped wings. He basically looks like a walking bat with pants.
Laughter.
SEA:
I was just going to say, like a right-side-up bat.
CARTE:
A right-side-up bat with pants. Yup.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So when you kill undead, do they die or do they come back to life? I don’t really understand how that would work.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I think when they get exploded, they’re not really going to come back—oh, that hand is still moving. Well that’s unsettling. Let’s just keep moving.
SEA:
So… as you guys step down out of the clearing and you start approaching the castle, you come across a beautifully paved road with cobblestones. It’s a feat of some engineering, because it stretches in both directions right up to the castle and down off into the valley, rolling up and down, in and out, coming back in and out of view.
And there is a very large sign on the path towards the castle just a few feet ahead.
MIK:
I would like to read the sign.
SEA:
OK, so Eggerton, you’re craning your neck up to read the sign. “One must arrive…”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
“One must arrive.”
SEA:
“Neither by horse or by foot…”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
“Neither by horse or by foot…”
SEA:
“Neither by road or by path…”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
“Neither by road or by path…”
SEA:
“If this person comes…”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
“If this person comes…”
SEA:
“…the kingdom will be saved.”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
“…the kingdom will be saved.”
SEA:
“If not, we shall all be destroyed.”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
“If not, we shall…”
I don’t like this sign.
SEA:
“By proclamation of His Excellency, King Pamir.”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Pamir, Pamir. Do you know a King Pamir?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I’m not familiar with King Pamir, because I’m on the same mission as you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe you read some extra briefing papers, I dunno.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(mutters)
MARISA (AS DARC:
So what do we think that means? I guess there’s only one way to enter the castle? And it’s not by foot.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Or on the road that leads to the castle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, what about flying? Blat can fly.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat, can we get on your back and fly?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You can’t get on my back… I’m not that strong—I just did the zombie thing! I can’t fly all three of us there. Oh… don’t make me go ahead.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You should probably go check it out.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(groans)
I don’t know how well I’m going to be welcomed. “Hello I’m a half-naked demon! Do you have any problems with the undead? Because I was probably the cause of that!”
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well… Wait. Wait, remember those medallions we were given? Maybe we should try and communicate and and ask for some advice about this.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. OK, I’m going to try first. I’m going to try first.
MIK:
So I hold onto my medallion around my neck and say,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello? Hello…
SEA:
Nothing happens.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello…? Mine’s broken.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did you try using the communications button?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh no, yeah, I knew about the button. I was gonna try and do it the hard way though, because you know… I wanted to save the buttons for later. So I’ll do the button now.
MIK:
So I push a button.
SEA:
You turn the dial to the Communication setting…
MIK:
Yes, I turn the dial to the Communication setting, because we had a full briefing on how these work…
SEA:
(laughs)
MIK:
And try talking into it again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello there. Hello. Hello. Come in. Roger, over.
Ananka’s voice comes over the radio, somewhat garbled.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello. Hello.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(over the medallion’s radio)
Hello.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hi. Ooo! How are you?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Hello. Eggerton, is you! It is you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, it is me. How are you?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I am good, how are you?
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, I’m not too bad. There were some zombies but Blat blew them up and then he got cut on a tree and he has bark in his pants. I don’t really know why—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
—what? What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Yep. Yep. No. We may have a situation here… Anaka. I am being given looks to report to you accurately what has happened and transpired, so from the beginning… We came here. My tummy was a little upset, I climbed a tree…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And we’re skipping ahead, and we’re skipping ahead…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh yeah, no, OK. And then I… Blat doesn’t have a shirt on, and he’s got abs, did you know he has abs? And then, we are at a castle and there’s a sign and the sign says some things about getting into the castle. Uh, there were zombies but the zombies are blown up now, I think, I really—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just read her the sign.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh yeah, so uh, the sign says…
MIK:
And I read her the sign.
SEA:
And we cut.
THE FRIEND SON:
SEA:
Blat, Darcy and Eggerton… you are in your dorm room. It’s an uneventful day. You can hear the sound of somebody trying to repair the lawn outside.
Laughter.
SEA:
And, you know, the school is pretty quiet. And what are you guys doing when you’re just in your dorm room between classes?
MIK:
I’m laying on a bed, staring at the ceiling, nibbling on a fairy cookie. A purple swirly one.
MARIS:
I’m meditating, trying to focus on these spells that I seem to have been given power over. But I have no mastery over them yet, so I’m just…
SEA:
And are you like, on your bed, or…
MARIS:
I think I’m just sitting on a cushion in the corner.
CARTE:
Blat’s in his quarters, trying to avoid Snegal, because he still thinks that perhaps something untoward happened between him and Snegal while he was high on fairy cakes.
SEA:
OK, so you’re on your little cot that you claimed, you’ve got all your shirts perfectly folded, and you notice… one of your shirts is missing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh now…! Who the…
Couldn’t be Eggerton, he wouldn’t fit in this. Might have been Darcy… I’ve noticed that she wears clothing that’s far too big for her.
That’s it! I’ll try to question Darcy. She says she’s meditating, learning spells—as if she’s going to be able to learn magic spells! I don’t care what era this is. People cannot learn magic spells. Accountancy, one can learn! Magic spells… I believe you cannot.
CARTE:
So Blat goes off in search of Darcy.
MARIS:
Who is sitting in the corner of the same room.
Laughter.
SEA:
You sit up on your bed, determined, Blat… and there’s Darcy sitting on the far side of your room.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I thought this would be harder.
Miss Kimble! A question about my laundry.
MARIS:
I don’t answer immediately.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(around a mouthful of cookies)
I don’t hink she han hear oo…
(a great deal more indistinct mumbling)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’re here too?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
My bed’s right here next to yours…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
I was so obsessed about the loss of a shirt, I didn’t notice that anyone else was here in the room.
Miss Kimble!
CARTE:
And he taps her in the middle of her forehead.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sputtering)
Blat! You know that I’m meditating! What are you doing?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, you’re learning magic because that’s a thing that’s possible. One of my shirts is missing!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So, you wear pants that are twice your size; I thought perhaps you had taken it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I didn’t touch your shirt!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is it the one you’re wearing? Because you’re wearing that one, if you’re looking for it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I have more than one shirt. They issued us more than one shirt. You have more than one shirt.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, and I’m wearing one of them. Is that the one you’re looking for?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I’m not looking for your shirt, I’m looking for my shirt.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve got an extra one if you need it. It might be a little small on you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It would be very small on me. Now—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know why you really want to wear one of mine then. It doesn’t make that much sense.
SEA:
In the hall you hear,
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blat! …oof!
Blat! …oomph!
SEA:
You hear a little patter of feet, then a trip—whump!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blaaat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. I’m sorry I interrupted you in your learning how to magic. Perhaps you could magic something where I don’t have to talk to him.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I think I have an idea who might have your shirt.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. I don’t want to talk to him. Could you please just meet him at the door, come up with an excuse as to why I cannot talk to him right now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sorry Blat. I think you gotta face up to this sooner or later.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, what good are you and your magic?! Go back to being unconscious while… awake.
(switching on the charm)
Eggerton!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blaaat! Oof!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You and I have always been close, and I think maybe you could do me this solid. Just go up to the door…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Go to the door…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And tell him that I’m not here and he should look far away.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK! I can do that for you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you very much. I will simply hide under my cot, and when he’s gone, I will reveal myself.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Excellent.
MIK:
I walk over to the door and open it… and I see Snegal.
SEA:
Snegal is standing there in a shirt that is eight times too big for him, and he keeps tripping and he makes his way to the door finally, and he’s like,
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Eggerton! Is Blat here? I want to show him, I put a shirt on like he said! He said Snegal should wear shirt! Snegal wearing the—little big, but ah ha ha!
SEA:
He’s flapping his arms, and the sleeves are just like flying around as he flaps his arms.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I was not supposed to tell you that Blat was in here, but I’m pretty sure he’s more interested in getting his shirt back and now that you found his shirt for him, why don’t you come in? He’s hiding under his cot—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! I give him shirt back! It doesn’t really fit!
SEA:
And so Snegal comes in and he trips and he hits his head, like just faceplants right inside the door.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh jeez, that looks like it hurt—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Ow, sorry! It’s a little hard to walk in this. Maybe you should take it off and we can give it back to Blat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK! OK, I’ll help you with that.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
No, wait, I’m stuck, that’s my tail! That’s my—ow! OK, no, wait, that’s my foot. I think I ripped—don’t tell Blat ! I made a small rip.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
That’s OK. We can fix it.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
OK! I’m free.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. So… Blat! Blat, come out from under the bed. We found your shirt. We found it, Blat. I know—
SEA:
You see a head come down…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Hi Blat! Snegal here, I help you get out, Blat! Here, I pull from your feet! Are you stuck? Snegal help!
SEA:
He’s trying to—he’s not doing anything, but he’s just like, tugging at your feet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We have your shirt!
CARTE:
I slowly get up… grab my shirt from Eggerton, lean down into his face and whisper,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know how you had a job in our time.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Oh wait. Snegal had a job, ha ha, was so excited about the shirt. Snegal has to bring you all to the quartermaster today. Yeah. Is important. I think I was supposed to do it earlier. Oh yeah! Come, we have to go to the quartermaster…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Snegal. Snegal… Obviously this is something we’re going to have to deal with right now.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes! Yes, we have to go to—Moira said go to quartermaster right after breakfast—oh, that was a long time ago.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, I understand that. But before we go see the quartermaster…
You see, Snegal, this has been a very trying time for me. I’ve been thrust backwards in time, I’ve been told that—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, ohh yes…
SEA:
He starts, like, he wraps his arms around you—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, give hug! Snegal feel for Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, yes, that’s…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, his Evilship! Give leg hugs! Leg hugs!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Very good, but see, that is part of the problem. See, I’m concerned that perhaps, due to my overwhelming fear and loneliness in the situation that I am in—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(aghast)
Oh no! Nooo! Snegal your friend! No! Never be lonely ever again!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And again, that’s part of the problem. Because I’m concerned that yesterday, during… a moment of weakness, that perhaps—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(singing)
Oh, Snegal sang the friend song…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, well, that’s not a euphemism that I’m aware of, but I believe you and I sang the… “friend song”…
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that was very wrong—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that we should not do that again. I apologize to you… small imp from a previous time with a lower education than mine.
Silence.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You no Snegal friend?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I believe perhaps that we could get to a point where we could be friends yes, but—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Good! Snegal do that! Snegal be friend!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes but… singing the “friend song” is not something that should occur again. I’m sorry. I was in a bad place and it shouldn’t have happened…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
OK! Friend song our secret.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah… Well! We’re saying this in front of the two of them, so I’m not sure how much of a secret that is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What is the Friend Song? How does it go?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
No friend song! We have to go. Snegal understand!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Excellent. All right, so we’ll pretend that that never occurred, and that we’re simply trapped in a previous time where we are solely responsible for saving the entire multiverse.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
And Snegal’s best friend ever.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… In a while, yes. Perhaps you can be Eggerton’s friend for a while, or Darcy’s compatriot.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(happily)
No, just Evilship!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Of course. Yes.
So! Let’s see what the quartermaster has to say.
MARIS:
So Darcy is collapsed on the floor laughing, and once she recovers her breath, she gets up and follows the rest of you to the quartermaster.
SEA:
OK. It’s not hard, because you can hear Snegal all the way down the hall…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(singing)
No, never sing the song! No the song, that’s our secret!
SEA:
And they are going off down the hall.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I wouldn’t be so superior. You think you can do magic.
MIDROLL: A RAINBOW OF GOODIE:
Midroll theme music plays.
ANNOUNCER (ELI)
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time… and Other Bothers.
SEA:
OK, Marisa, take 37… This one is for Stitcher and then we’re gonna go through the four lines—this time though, I want you to really pep it up, like, pretend you’re riding a horse. And—action!
MARIS:
Wh… Yeah, OK, uh…
“Hey everyone! Thanks for listening on Stitcher, um… We’re really pleased to have you listening to The End of Time and Other Bothers. If you want to—”
Is this… am I riding English or Western?
SEA:
OK, cut! Cut. No, I’m not really buying the horse thing.
OK, let’s try that again. Let’s do Stitcher again. Let’s get into the patreon.com/albasalix line.
MARIS:
OK…
SEA:
Right? OK, let’s get into that a little faster. So this time I want you to pretend that you’re a unicorn. A beautiful, flowing unicorn. And—action!
MARIS:
OK, uh—
(sweet, whinnying voice)
“Hi! Thanks for listening on Stitcher! Uh, if you would like to donate to our show you can go to patreon.com/albasalix—ahh, a rainbow of goodies await you! Uh… You can also rate and review and tell a friend! Nei-i-gh!”
SEA:
OK, cut! Cut! It was beautiful, beautiful, Marisa! That was great, beautiful.
MARIS:
I’ve played unicorns twice before.
SEA:
It was really—I really liked the nuance there.
MARIS:
Thanks.
SEA:
You know… Can we do iTunes now? So the line’s going to be iTunes. And you know, I want something a little, I don’t know… a little more sensual for iTunes, right? Because it’s sexy. OK. And take 73—action!
MARIS:
(drops her voice to a breathy purr)
“Thanks for listening on iTunes. We love it when you rate and review us, or even better, tell a friend…”
(attempts a suggestive laugh)
SEA:
OK, cut, cut, cut… no, I’m not buying it, Darcy. Can you pretend you’re leaving your voicemail message at work? And… action.
MARIS:
Oh. Yeah, Uh…
“Hi, thanks for listening on iTunes. You can rate and review and tell a friend, and I may be on vacation at—”
No, wait, sorry, that’s my voicemail message, um…
“Rate and review and tell a friend, and you can use hashtag #OtherBothers when you talk about us.”
Right? No sorry, I screwed up the line there.
SEA:
Cut, cut. Yeah I know, it’s OK. Shake it off, shake it off.
OK. This time I want you to do it sexy and sensual, like you’re leaving a voice mail message—but someone knocks on the door halfway through. And—action!
MARIS:
But what—
(sighs)
“Hi… Thanks for listening on iTunes. You can donate at patreon.com/albasalix. You can also—what the frig do you want?! I’m doing a message here! They’re supposed to—what? No! No, I’m not ready! God dammit.”
SEA:
Cut!
Midroll theme music plays.
THE QUARTERMASTE:
SEA:
So Snegal takes you down to the first floor to a door and he gestures to the door, goes—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, must go make the lunch!
SEA:
And he scurries off. And the door says QUARTERMASTER.
MARIS:
Darcy knocks on the door.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello? Hello, it’s the three people from the future…
MARIS:
I just open the door.
A sweeping synthesizer melody plays, grand and mysterious.
SEA:
OK. You see a really long room and a counter at the front. And floating off down shelves that seem to go on a really long way, you see this translucent form hovering in the air and it’s waving these iridescent tendrils that are flowing out all around it. And there are weird lumps sort of inside the translucent jelly-like body, and it spins as if noticing you or something… and then begins to fly through the air towards you and the counter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is that the quartermaster?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m not sure, but I’m going to wait outside here, and you can let me know.
MIK:
And I scurry out.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What—
(sighs)
Hello, excuse me!
MARIS:
And I try to get the attention of the tendrilly being.
The melody returns, wavering tentatively.
SEA:
A tendril sneaks out as it gets closer and sort of like caresses the side of your head…
MARIS:
And I move away quickly…
SEA:
The tendril pulls away.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you… communicate?
SEA:
A tendril sleeks out towards your head.
MARIS:
OK, so I let it touch me this time.
A sudden burst of music, like a blaze of light, that gives way to something halfway between a data transmission and a babbling brook.
SEA:
OK. You just feel this instant connection and all these like energy flowing into your head, and it’s like this whole conversation happens… and what goes through your brain?
MARIS:
I am shocked that this is happening, that I’m able to communicate in this way with another being…
SEA:
You see all these memories flashing past from your life, which one jumps out?
The music slowly resolves into two airy chords. The sounds of a city park.
MARIS:
I think I remember the time I went to the park with my co-worker from the cafeteria and how we had a great time, and we played with these little sailboat things that were out there… and it was a really bright beautiful day—and a rare day in Balgomar where we had vegetation around us and stuff. And that just jumps out of me.
The music ends.
SEA:
Suddenly the connection is broken. You suddenly realize all the tendrils were on your head…
A slurping sound.
SEA:
And it flies off down the corridor, and then it comes flying back to the counter and it’s carrying all this stuff inside its gelatinous floating body. And then it just ex-plumphs them all down onto the counter with a clatter.
You see toy sailboats. You see some of the snacks you had that day, Impescor or whatever. You see the basket that you guys took to the park, or something like it. So all that stuff gets dropped on a counter and it’s just waiting.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um… guys?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(from outside)
Are you still alive?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I am, but I do not know what’s going on in here. Are you going to come in?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh… Blat’s coming in!
MIK:
And Blat gets a couple little hands shoving his backside.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat, I don’t get it—the tendrilly thing touched me and all these memories went through my head… and now look what’s on the counter. It’s stuff from one of my memories!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oooh, I believe this may be a beholder! I read about these as a child.
Laughter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What’s that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well… the the book that I was reading about beholders in was actually more of a fairy tale type of—
The wavering synthesizer melody.
SEA:
A tendril is reaching out for your head.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, heh… yes, that’s very good. I’ll have you know that I recently found out that I have some, um, personal boundary issues. I don’t know if us getting that intimate is such a good idea—
SEA:
It touches your head.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! There was an incident between me and someone else here that involved touching that led to uncomfortableness…
Another blast of burbling electronic music. Distantly, we hear a bazooka explosion and Snegal crooning a lullaby to Blat.
SEA:
And suddenly you are reliving that whole incident with Snegal,
(singing)
Singing the friend song…
You actually see the whole scene play out. And it’s just Snegal there caressing your head, singing his song as you snooze, and then you see these guys show up, and then you give him a coupon and tell him to wear a shirt.
And then all of a sudden, the tentacles—you realize you’re almost encased inside this thing. All the tendrils pull off and it dashes down a corridor comes flying back and on top of all the stuff that it’s dumped there for Darcy, it dumps out another coupon for a shirt cleaning, it dumps a half-eaten fairy cake, and… what else did you guys have at that time? Oh, and like a bazooka shell, all land on the counter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
See?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh yes, yes, I see. I see that I didn’t actually do anything with Snegal! Thank you, Beholder Being, for giving me this information that I could have used half an hour ago!
SEA:
It wiggles a little. And it’s like, leaning past you guys as if looking for the third person.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think it wants Eggerton.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, we’re going to give him Eggerton… Just a moment please, Beholder being!
CARTE:
And Blat walks out into the hall, picks up Eggerton by his pants…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What, what, what are you doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’re going to get beholdered!
(shouting over Eggerton’s objections)
Everyone else had to be beholdered, you’re going to be beholdered.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t want to be beholdered!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I didn’t actually have sex with Snegal, so I did a big production for no reason—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? You had sex with Snegal?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I did not have sex with Snegal, that’s the point!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But why would you say that—
CARTE:
And I just shove him inside the gelatinous Beholder.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Here! Get yourself beholdered good!
A third blast of burbling music.
SEA:
OK, so you shove… Basically, so Eggerton your head is shoved into this gelatinous floating fish-like air jelly being, and the tentacles wrap around you… and you see all kinds of memories and feelings flooding you. Which one comes to the surface?
MIK:
Sitting in my apartment in Balgomar are looking at the beautiful crack on the concrete wall that I consider art and admiring it while nibbling on a frosted fairy cake.
SEA:
OK. All of a sudden you relive that moment—like, you see that crack like you’ve never witnessed it before…
MIK:
There’s a tear in my eye.
A slurp.
SEA:
And then suddenly you’re popped out of the being and it races down the corridor of shelves and then comes flying back and dumps out a frosted fairy cake onto the counter and a brochure for a ride that you remember picking up that day now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ooo, a fairy cake.
MIK:
And I pick it up and eat it.
SEA:
Roll Fairy Cakes.
MIK:
Roll Fairy Cakes. That is an 8.
SEA:
OK. You are fully healed, even though you already were, and you are confused.
MIK:
What?
SEA:
Because that is a partial success.
MIK:
What?
SEA:
Remember the fairy cake? If you read the fairy—yeah, thank you. I fell for that.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
You are confused.
MIK:
Huh?
SEA:
I don’t know if you’re going to be able to tell he’s confused, I couldn’t…
CARTE:
I have no idea. No.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So, what do you guys think is happening here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Where?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Here! In front of you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Where? Who?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, it’s the fairy cake, isn’t it? Sometimes things go weird with Eggerton when he has a fairy cake.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I actually hadn’t noticed this time, no.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look at this brochure…
MARIS:
And then I just start—so I pick up my sailboat and I wave it at the gelatinous mass…
The quartermaster’s melodic noodling.
SEA:
It waves one of its arms.
MARIS:
I put it back down.
SEA:
It reaches out a tendril towards your head—
MARIS:
And I back up.
SEA:
It pulls it back.
MARIS:
And I pick up the basket and I wave it.
SEA:
It waves its tendrils back at you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What does it want me to do with this stuff?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It wants you to go sailing. Let’s go sailing in this boat! OK, I’m going to take the boat and go sailing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton put the boat down. The boat’s too small. You can’t go sailing in it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But it’s so pretty.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Put it down, Eggerton.
SEA:
You hear a voice from the hallway.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
(throat clearing)
Hello everyone. Are you all outfitted and ready?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Cyrus, we’re going to go sailing in this boat. You should come with us, it’s going to be a lot of fun.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I’ll take that as a yes. Let’s go. I have to take you to the Nexus.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, wait! Cyrus, what what’s happening in here? What is this thing? What is this… jelly monster?
A sad little melody.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I think you just hurt its feelings.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?
MARIS:
And I look around to see if this is true.
SEA:
It’s shrunken a little. All the tendrils are pulled in.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Beholder. Please refer to it as a Beholder.
SEA:
It unfurls.
A more cheerful melody.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I assume you’ve all met our quartermaster, Pfillllll-thi-tckkkkt?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It is the quartermaster!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
So, if you just want to load up with all your… what you’ve been outfitted with and we’ll take you into the Nexus.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you mean this sailboat?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
That’s a rather unusual choice…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I had a cookie, but I ate it.
Laughter.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Well if you’ll just take whatever you’re taking and come with me.
MIK:
I take the brochure off the table and stick it in my fairy pouch.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, just a moment. So, I believe what’s supposed to happen is that if actual warriors came in here they would think about warrior things, and the beholder would give warrior-type equipment. But since we are just three random future yobbos, we’ve been given things based on those memories, such as sailboats, fairy cakes and the knowledge that you did not sleep with a co-worker.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re all going to die, aren’t we.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, more than likely but at least I did not have sex with an imp!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why did you have sex with an imp?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I did not have sex with an imp! That is the point!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But you say that, and it makes me think that you probably did have sex with an imp.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I thought I did; it turns out I didn’t. The Beholder—thank you Beholder…
A little trill from the quartermaster.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…gave me the knowledge that I did not. Oh Lord, I probably confused Snegal to high heaven…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, we’re done with the Snegal thing, can we move on please? Let it go, Blat. Let. It. Go.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, let’s move on. We have a sailboat with which to conquer evil! Let’s move on!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, everybody in the boat, I’ll drive.
THE HEART OF THE NEXU:
SEA:
You step down some steps into an ancient library that defies geometry. There are shelves and corridors heading off in 360 degrees: upside down, behind you, the ceiling… everywhere you turn, it’s as if everything orients to you and there’s just rows and rows of shelves with books. Every once in a while, you catch something moving or dashing past in the distance.
And it is very brightly lit, and in the centre of the room at a table you see Moira, and she’s speaking—Moira, who you met earlier—she is speaking to another woman who… I’m going to put Mags on the spot and have her describe what she wants Ananka to look like.
MAGGI:
Oh mah gawd.
SEA:
I know I didn’t even warn you about this. I even think about it. So, you see talking to Moira:
MAGGI:
(in Ananka’s Slavic accent)
And they see Ananka… and her hair is a dark violet like a sky after a storm. She wears a cloak of all black, and boots that sparkle like the universe.
SEA:
And they appear to have been in a heated argument when Moira stands up and waves a hand in a shushing gesture at Ananka and starts approaching all of you on the stairs.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Welcome, welcome. Welcome to you all, to the heart of the Nexus, the library. Thank you all for coming. I assume you made it to the quartermaster OK?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We we were there. Yes.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Good, good good good. So, come come, come forward… Let me, I’m sorry, let me introduce my sister Ananka.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hi.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We… quite enjoy your library that doesn’t make any sense.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I like your shoes.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Oh, thank you. Very pleasing to meet you.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I apologize for bringing you all in so early. My sister and I were just discussing it… We sort of need your help a little earlier than we normally would have.
But! But—but we found a destination that is completely safe. There is no Shattering. So, it will be a great first run for you all.
So, in order to make this happen though, we need to sort of get you out of the Plebe status. So as of today, you’re all cadets!
(a burst of nervous laughter)
Ha ha ha ha!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yay, cadets! I’m so happy to be a cadet. I wish I could write to my friends back in Balgomar and let them know that I’m a cadet now. It’s a pretty neat promotion. I was never a cadet before. I’m quite pleased to have a title like this—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Let’s move on. Thank you Eggerton. OK, let’s get you all set up with medallions.
SEA:
And so, she pulls open a drawer and there’s drawers everywhere she just pulls open this drawer that’s suddenly in front of her and she pulls out three medallions that are made entirely of this grey metal, and in the centre is this giant stone that’s like a colorless ruby, but giant… And she starts handing out one to each of you. I don’t know, what’s an example of a colourless…? I guess a diamond.
Laughter.
MIK:
A ruby, which is defined by its colour…
SEA:
A ruby, which is defined by its colour. Thankfully Darcy gave me a look. Everyone else is like, we’re going with it!
MIK:
I gave a look too.
SEA:
I didn’t see the look.
So… oh well, we’ll just keep that.
She hands each of you a medallion, one to each of you.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
This is referred to as an ICT…
(she pronounces it “ice-tea”)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, no. This is a piece of jewelry… not a refreshing summer drink. I’m just a little confused by the name, “iced tea”.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Can I have a straw for my iced tea?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Oh, is that a drink in your in your time?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I am sorry. So, it’s an Integrated Comms and Transport Device. You’re going to see, there are four settings here. So, the circle at the top, that is Recharge. So if you want to just maximize the recharge on the device you put it there.
If you want to use it as a comms to talk back to us, in this case you’ll be speaking with Ananka on this mission, you’ll turn it here to the setting for Comms.
At the end of your mission, you will turn it here to Transport, and basically press in, and that should transport you back.
And then this final one is the new setting, which is part of the whole new plan that I told you about and this is Detect. So, it will detect if the Shattering is in where you’re going.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well now, this is all very simple. I don’t see how any would when using this in a future point could be the least bit confused!
Laughter.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Now, do keep in mind that if you leave it in Detect, it will drain the battery and it will need to recharge. OK? So it will recharge slowly… but just keep that in mind.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But we won’t need to use Detect, because you’re sending us to a place that has no Shattering today, right?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Right. Correct. Correct. This timetable has been slightly accelerated due to certain forces at work—
SEA:
And she gives Ananka an interesting glare at that moment.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Now, what we’re going to be doing is sending you on your first mission. You will be travelling into a storyverse. This library tracks all of the stories in existence. So we have taken a story that Ananka assures me, through her sight, is free of the Shattering, and you will just be going into it to retrieve something of significance from that story. So, this will just be a nice dry run to get us all going again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I have a picnic basket.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Oh, that’s lovely. I hear this world is quite lovely, isn’t it Ananka?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
It is beautiful, most beautiful.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. No. What I mean is that’s all I have, is a picnic basket, and this toy boat, and you’re sending us on some mission somewhere where we don’t know what’s going to happen, and I’m supposed to defend myself with a picnic basket?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I’m not sure why you have a picnic basket, but it would be a lovely picnic. I hear it’s quite beautiful here. It’s the mountains you’re going to. They’re quite beautiful. You can have a nice picnic. Just find an artifact from the story. We will be here to talk you through it, and then we’ll bring you back and we can debrief.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So, you’re saying this should just be like a walk in the park where we could have a nice picnic, pick up some glowy device, and we’re done! And we should be transported home.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Oh no, you will be transported home. There was only one case and we’ve fixed things since then. Right, sister?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Very long time ago. Everything now is 100 percent.
MARIS:
And Darcy looks over and Eggerton and just shakes her head.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uhh… what’s a storyverse?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Our reality is made up of stories. They are more powerful than you may know. And so, the Shattering is working its way through, corrupting all of these stories in the world, which is how your future came to be. So, we are claiming back certain stories that we are going to keep out of the Shattering’s reach. And Ananka is working to help find those stories that will matter. We were just hoping to have a little more time, weren’t we sister?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Indeed. Nothing goes as planned sometimes.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Mmm hmm. Mostly when it comes to boyfriends.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
OK, we don’t need to talk about that. Not in front of them.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Very well.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t mean to be impolite, but it seems that if you have—is it Ananka? Is that correct?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
That’s correct.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. If you have Ananka helping us, she must have some special knowledge of all this. Why can’t she go into the storyverse and get the artifact? It feels like you don’t even need us.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
That would be lovely, but we have to operate from here in the Nexus. We aren’t… allowed to directly influence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
All right, I don’t think we have much choice here. Grab your extraneous items that look like they’re not going to help us in the least, and let’s go and do this thing they want us to do.
MIK:
I look in my pouch and make sure the brochure is still tucked in their nicely.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’ve been promoted to a point where we’re now allowed to die; I was able to keep it in my pants; so I say let’s go! What’s the worst that could possibly happen?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
To make you feel better, tell you what. We’ll give you two silver beetles, OK?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I feel immediately better!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Good. That’s good. Love the confidence. So—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The entire storyverse, the word “sarcasm” has never come up in any of them.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I do need to work on my sarcasm detection, don’t I, Ananka?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
A little bit.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
OK, so these are two interdimensional quarantine beetles. Who would like them?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This one looks nice. I like shiny things.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
There you go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Darcy, I believe you know how to use a beetle?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(resigned)
Yes, give me the beetle.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
You shouldn’t have to use it. But but if you were to come across an influence of the Shattering in that world you’re going to, you can just stick this beetle on them, activate it, and they will be gone—taken out of that world.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry, stick the beetle on who?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Well, if, let’s say there was Shattering influence—I’m just saying there won’t be—but you can just stick this beetle to whoever or whatever is influenced, and they’ll be torn out of that world.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Where do they go?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
…We deal with them.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh… OK.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
OK, so Ananka and I will just take you now to the Hall of Lore… and any last questions we’ll answer on our way.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey Blat, want to bring an extra shirt just in case?
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…I’m sure this shirt will be fine.
SEA:
A hallway appears as Moira and Ananka lead you up out of the library… and it is a white hall that stretches as far as you can see. And all these doors start to fly down out of the ceiling and land on the walls and on the sides. And Moira steps forward and puts a key into a device in the centre of the floor, and one of the doors to your left swings open.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
OK, cadets, I’m sure you guys are all going to do fine. Right, Ananka?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Yes. My vision says yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Don’t worry, we have a boat!
SEA:
And it’s just blackness inside the door.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know if you noticed, but this door doesn’t actually go anywhere, so maybe we should try one that goes—
MARIS:
So, Darcy pushes Eggerton through the door…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaa!
MARIS:
…and follows.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Peace out, so says Blaaaaat!
The roaring sound of the portal.

MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello there! Come in. Roger, over.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Eggerton, is you!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Let me introduce my sister Ananka.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Very pleasing to meet you.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
As of today you’re all cadets.
(a burst of nervous laughter)
Ha ha ha ha!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I assume you’ve all met our quartermaster, Pfillllll-thi-tckkkkt?
A little synthesizer trill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I have a picnic basket.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I had a cookie but I ate it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We have a sailboat with which to conquer evil!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
We have taken a story that Ananka assures me is free of the Shattering. You will just be going into it to retrieve something of significance from that story.
SEA:
You guys all step through the portal. You’re standing in a lush valley leading up to a storybook castle.
Zombie groans.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, just having a little interaction with the undead!
A rocket from his bazooka hisses away and explodes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There were some zombies but Blat blew them up and then he got cut on a tree and he has his bark in his pants. I don’t really know—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Yep. Yep. No.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
If you were to come across an influence of The Shattering you can just stick this beetle on them, activate it and they will be gone.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry, stick the beetle on who?
SEA:
Their eyes go completely black.
A deep, unnaturally echoing voice.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Who are you?
Kill them all.
SEA:
“One must arrive, neither by horse or by foot…”
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What about flying? Blat can fly.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You should probably go check it out.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(groans)
WHAT’S THE PLAN?
Violins play a solemn melody.
SEA:
The camera begins over some dead bodies in a muddy field, moves past a burning fire and up and around to see a beautiful castle in the distance. And we fly forward coming down to our favorite three: Eggerton, who appears to be shouting into a medallion that he’s holding up to his mouth; Darcy, who is looking not amused; and Blat, as they stand before a signpost in the road on the path to the castle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…so it clearly indicates that we have to go inside the castle, but we can’t go inside the castle through the door, or through the road, or through walking, and that kind of limits our options, and Blat’s being a little weird about his wings today, I’m not too sure why, but that seems like the easy way. Maybe you could advise us, because you’re our advisor and you somehow can help us with how we should go forward into this adventure—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sharply)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. Yes?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let. Her. Answer.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh yeah. Over and out.
A little radio beep.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(over the medallion radio)
So you are having trouble accessing the door?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, we haven’t been to the door per se, but there’s a sign that says, hey, don’t use a door.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
OK, let me just read this part. OK. Yes, I seem to recall this. “One must come to me, neither clothed nor naked, neither on foot nor on horse and speak to me neither indoors nor out.”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, Blat took off his shirt.
SEA:
So what you’re staring at on the sign reads different: “One must arrive, neither by horse or by foot, neither by road or by path. If this person comes, the kingdom will be saved. If not, we shall be destroyed. By proclamation of His Excellency King Pamir.”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re getting some conflicting information here, please hold.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we have to go with what’s on the sign. That’s what’s in front of us, so I don’t think we need to care if we’re naked. We just need to worry about how we’re going to get there.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Says the person who isn’t going to fly off by themselves they get murderized immediately.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, says that person.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(groans)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I also do not want to get murderized. So I don’t know if that should be—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And as a non-flying individual you won’t be.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Exactly. Thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Now, Blat, how will you let us know that you’ve been murderized? That’s the important part. You can use your medallion!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, good, I’m glad to know we can keep right up to the minute at the exact moment where I’ll die an excruciating death!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excellent. OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And how am I to arrive neither clothed nor naked?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s what I’m saying. Ignore that part that’s not on the sign. It was just what Ananka read from her point of view.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
So, some time, is only a version of that story. The universe is basically the same, but sometimes, it’s just a little different. But it’s a version. Is just a version of that story.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s… so what I’m being told from the medallion lady is that it’s a version of the story that’s not—
CARTE:
Blat grabs the medallion that’s around Eggerton’s neck—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aack!
CARTE:
—and yells into it:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What happens when we get to the door?!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
OK. In the story. Ah, OK. Is it possible that the door can ask you a question?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know! I’m not at the door, I’m here screaming into a piece of jewelry, half-naked!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
But you’re half-naked, so it means you’re not fully clothed, so you have one of the above!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel like I would have more success if I was trying to order a pizza from this woman!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat. Just fly up to the castle and then come back and tell us what you see. Obviously there’s a door there.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(choking)
Could you please let go of my medallion—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I’m terribly sorry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasping for breath)
OK. OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Off I go; if I get murdered, you’ll just have to wait longer for me to come back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(calling after him)
Remember to put your dial on your medallion to comm!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(fading away into the distance)
I’m not an idiot!
SEA:
(laughs)
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy roleplaying game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your Game Master is Sean Howard, with players Carter Siddall, Marisa King and Michael Howie, and special guest Maggie Makar.
Episode 7: The Riddle, Part 2.
THE CASTL:
SEA:
So, Blat you are flying towards a castle. It’s not that far away—you’ll get there pretty quickly. It’s made out of white stone and it gleams almost as much as the golden conical roofs of the innumerable turrets. In fact, there are so many turrets on this castle it’s like saplings in a forest, each searching for the light. There’s almost too many for the size of the castle that it is.
The walls are many stories high, and as you’re coming closer you see a rather impressive gatehouse. It has a large portcullis that is open, and you see what appears to be four guards standing there and they’re sort of at attention. And then one of them looks and spots you, and then you see a lot of commotion and yelling and pointing.
And now you see movement on the parapet, and you see people running out with what appear like bows, running along the top of the parapet.
CARTE:
And that’s my cue to land. So, I’ll slowly circle down until I… I don’t want to land too close to where the guards are on the ground. I’ll try to land about 50 feet away.
SEA:
OK. So, Darcy and Eggerton, you’re back at this proclamation that is posted on a board, and you see Blat take off, go about 500 feet and then begin to circle and land. So you can sort of see him, he’s not—he’s a few minutes’ walk for you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shall we walk towards him?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We should probably wait for him to report back to us. I think it’s a nice spot though! Maybe we can take out the boat.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gritted teeth)
Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Fine fine. OK.
(into his medallion radio)
Uh… This is Eggerton here, uh, Medallion Lady. We are going to go forth and look for Blat. So I’m going to switch this to Recharge for a bit, because we have been warned repeatedly about that. So if you will stay tuned, we will be back with an update when an update is available to be provided to you, and we will give you the information we have at that time.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(over the medallion)
Roger that, fairy boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. Over and out.
MIK:
And I switch the medallion to Recharge.
MARIS:
And I press the Comm button on my medallion and I say:
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat. Blat. Can you hear me?
SEA:
Where is your medallion set to? Have you changed it?
CARTE:
I have not changed it yet.
Laughter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat? Blat? Argh! He didn’t change the dial. I knew this would happen. Let’s just go, let’s go find him.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, OK, you go first.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And I switch to Recharge as well.
SEA:
OK. Blat, you circle down and hit the ground, and you see five archers on the top, all drawing bows. You hear some shouting in the distance. You see the guards that were out by the gatehouse have now run inside and they’re slowly lowering the portcullis—
(he imitates the grinding of the portcullis)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouts)
Greetings and salutations, guardians of the castle! I have come, neither through walking or… a wheelèd chariot—I believe your sign said something about that. So I have arrived through the proper fashion and I bid you greetings!
Hello!
SEA:
OK, so Blat, you’re going to roll Defy Danger…
Laughter.
SEA:
And you’ve got to tell me before you roll though, like… I guess you’re speaking. So it’s going to be like Charisma?
CARTE:
Charisma, which I have a +2 on.
SEA:
Woo! OK, roll it.
CARTE:
Blat is nothing if not charismatic.
He rolls.
MARIS:
Oooh, that’s pretty good.
CARTE:
That’s an 11!
SEA:
OK. So, you hear a shout go up:
SEAN (AS A GUARD)
Hold!
SEA:
And you see the portcullis coming down. You hear another shout, and some shouting back, and then the portcullis stops… and you see one gentleman sort of ducking under the portcullis and walking forward towards you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, good! The manager I assume.
SEA:
He’s still about a hundred feet away. He’s walking towards you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Kind sir! I was wondering if perhaps you could help us, since I came through wingèd flight and not through the power of… shoe leather.
SEA:
He stops about 50 paces away.
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
(shouting)
Are they with you?
SEA:
He points past, over your shoulder.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, they are with me. They’ll be here in just a moment. We didn’t know if they, coming through walking, would count. We thought you preferred your guests to arrive via the air.
How’d I do?
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
What are you? What foul beast?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
“Foul beast” is a little impolite…
(shouts)
I am half-human.. and that’s the half that counts. The good half, eh? Ha ha ha. That’s right. Uh…
It’s a long story. My father had a brief dalliance during his young-man days with someone not entirely of this dimensional plane, and nine months later I arrived. But just know that I bear you no ill will and… did I mention I came by the air? That seems to be something that your castle-type folk prefer.
Laughter.
SEA:
He’s just staring at you. He’s like,
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
Have your people put down their weapons. Put all your weapons down on the ground.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We have no weapons. The woman that approacheth from the north has a boat. I don’t think that counts as a weapon. We are weaponless. The larger fellow has some baked goods that perhaps might be… I don’t know how many of you there are. He has quite a few.
(stage whisper)
He could stand to get rid of some. He doesn’t need them all, if you know what I’m saying.
(raises his voice again)
Uh… So just any minute they’ll be here, and… completely weaponless; without weapons of any—do they need to keep pointing arrows at me? Perhaps that could stop while we’re doing our tête-à-tête?
SEA:
He makes a gesture and the portcullis starts to raise and you see a wagon coming out. He’s like:
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
You are within range! Stay where you are!
MARIS:
So Darcy and Eggerton have now approached close enough that they can see Blat gesturing, and when he gestures towards us I put my hand on Eggerton and we stop. And then I hear him say “boat”, so I reach into my satchel to hold my toy boat aloft, thinking that this has been asked to show the boat… and I think we just stand there and wait for further instructions.
Are you holding your fairy cakes aloft, perhaps?
MIK:
I’m eating one.
SEA:
Roll Fairy Cakes.
MARIS:
(laughing)
Oh no…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did… did he call me tubby?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I didn’t hear that.
MIK:
And that is a 7.
SEA:
(resigned)
OK, you’re drunk.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(slurring his words)
But he’s such a good half-demon…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. You didn’t even need a fairy cake! Why did you eat a fairy cake?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because I’m… I stress eat sometimes! I mean, there’s all these pointy things pointing at us…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well now you seem completely out of it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(cheerfully)
Hey guyyys!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shhhhh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, shhh! Shh! Darcy, be quiet!
SEA:
The guy takes a step back…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m not that close to them…
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
They are part of my party, but not people that I’ve known for quite some—that’s a lovely wagon. Is that for us? I didn’t think you wanted us entering via wagon.
Shall we get on the wagon? Is that customary?
SEA:
The wagon is coming towards you. There are eight guards with it and it is like a cage.
Laughter.
SEA:
And they are wheeling it out to you. Towards you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Did not see the cage; not a fan of the cage. Perhaps I could just walk in with my—all right, I don’t know why she’s holding the boat.
(to Darcy)
Put the boat down!
MARIS:
And Darcy puts the boat back into her satchel.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Good.
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
They may walk in. You have to ride in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I want a ride too!
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
He can ride in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right! We’re going for a ride, Blat! Let’s go for a—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton! Just keep quiet!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(not quiet)
I’m being quiet! You be quiet! I can be quiet whenever I want!
SEA:
A wagon comes up to where he is and they stop and he opens the door and he’s like:
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
You are welcome into our kingdom, through your… chariot, sir.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel that the sarcasm is unnecessary.
CARTE:
And Blat enters the cage…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Are you coming Eggerton? You could just walk—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wooo! Let’s go for a cage ride.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why are you getting in a cage, Blat?
MARIS:
We’ve, I feel, reached Blat by now.
SEA:
Yep.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat, what are you doing in the cage?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I have to enter through the cage because I’m apparently a demonic hellspawn from Hades below.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, yeah, that makes sense.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
MIK:
I run forward and jump in.
SEA:
You jump in.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So we can walk in?
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
You are welcome if you have no weapons. We’re going to pat you down. You are welcome to enter—walk in, or you may ride in his chariot.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I have this boat.
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
…That’s allowed.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ll happily walk in, thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sings softly)
We’re going for a riiiide…
SEA:
So four guards—two are on each side of you and they close the door and lock it on your “chariot”.
So Darcy, as the guard locks the door and turns, you notice that he’s got a strange rectangular nameplate-like thing that has a series of numbers on it. And it just strikes you—it’s almost like a flash—being back working in the cafeteria and how every employee had one of those, the same shape, even though this is made of different material.
MARIS:
OK.
MIK:
I turn my communicator back on and say:
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, so now we’re in a cage, and we’re going for a ride, and I’ll be back to you soon!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wait, do not talk—
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
(sharply)
What’s he doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um, he—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s OK—
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
Stop the wagon!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no. It’s perfectly fine. As you can see my friend is very inebriated and loves his medallion very much, and sometimes shares secrets with it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I loooooove it!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You share secrets with jewelry, don’t you? Yes…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I looove my medallion and the lady that talks from it!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No…
(laughs nervously)
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(over the medallion)
Hello? Are you there? What is happening?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m here! It’s OK. They’re asking about you. I’m telling them though that you’re very nice and that everything’s going to be OK.
SEA:
You hear Eggerton being grabbed and dragged away.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaa!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Uh… Don’t be scared. I think you may be going to see a king or a queen or someone very important!
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
Stop that thing! Make it stop!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can make it stop but you all need to give me my hands back from behind my back.
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
Let one of his hands go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK so. OK, I’m going to let you go because they’ve got the arrows pointed at me and there’s a sword in my back. So I’m going to turn this off for now but I look forward to talking with you again later.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Roger that, fairy boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, over and out!
MIK:
And I turn it off.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that of course was our famous ventriloquism act!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The three of us travel across different counties, with our special talking jewelry. I am Blat, he’s a drunken idiot, and she’s wearing pants that are too big for her. We may shorten the name of our group, but perhaps your King and Queen will enjoy watching our special program.
THE CEL:
A metal door slams, and a latch slides into place.
SEA:
Cut to all three of you being thrown into a cell and the door slams shut, and the head guard dusting his hands and walking out of the room.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh hi.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Why? Why, when we’re headed towards an unknown castle, would you decide that that would be the moment to get completely blotto?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I was a little bit nervous and I heard you say that I was tubby, and when I feel bad about myself I start eating and the only thing I had to eat was a fairy cake—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! Be quiet, Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is getting too much. We could be in big danger. Sometimes, I think it would be better if you weren’t with us. Maybe they should have taken you somewhere else.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shrinking away)
Oh, I’m sorry…
MARIS:
And Darcy’s hair starts to stand up.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why… OK, I’m going to go to this corner.
SEA:
Her eyes get a strange yellow gleam.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s very pretty, but I’m going to go over here and, Blat? Blat, Blat, can I—Blat, you just stand there and I’m going to come behind you. Blat? There we go.
MARIS:
And as he goes behind Blat I grab his little pouch, I think you have?
MIK:
Yes.
MARIS:
And I rip it off him.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I am taking your fairy cakes until further notice!
MARIS:
And I stick them in my satchel.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
My fairy cakes…
SEA:
So you are all three in what appears to be a pretty standard small prison. As you came in, you would have seen that there were four cells, most of which were empty. There does appear to be someone in the cell next to you. It’s all open bars. There is an old desk in the room, but there is nobody sitting at it and all the guards have gone back out the front door.
Now, as you were coming into the castle and you were led in through the portcullis you would have gone through the inner ward of the castle. You would have noticed that it was a very large open space, but there were about 50 workers all building some kind of monument in the centre—like massive—like, Steadfast massive—monument in the centre of this castle, that appeared to be some kind of giant flower. And then they would have taken you right into the guard shack, and unceremoniously dumped you there.
MIK:
Did they take our medallions?
SEA:
They did not take your medallions.
MIK:
I’m sitting and I’ve got a tear in my eye from being yelled at. And turn my medallion back to Communicate.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m sorry but they yelled at me and now I’m kind of sad. And she took my fairy cakes and I don’t know how to be sad without my fairy cakes.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Don’t be sad, fairy boy. I feel you will be okay. I have seen this. I know you will be fine. I trust the vision.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You saw us in the jail cell?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Maybe it was… Not as accurate as I had hoped. But this is minor speed bump in the road.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But maybe you could help us get out of the jail cell, because you’ve got this communicating thing, and you can see everything. So maybe you could say like, “Hey there’s a weak bar in the thing and you just twist it and it opens!” Then everyone will like me again and then I’ll have my fairy cakes back!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I can see most things but… these sorts of the little details, not really a strong point.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Ananka, I think I found another book!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Oh, let me see.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Oh no, sorry. It’s in a strange language. I’ll keep looking. Maybe we’ll find one that’s more exact to what’s happening.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Hold still hang tight. Figure something out if you can. This is what you have trained for. I know you are ready for this. We will get back to you. I’m so sorry. We will get back to you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We didn’t get any of this training—
SEA:
And it cuts off.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, OK.
MIK:
Can I put it back to Recharge? I shift over and say,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So… I talked with Ananka and she says that she saw this, but not—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We heard, Eggerton. We heard!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. There is a guard. We’re going to try to barter our way out of this with either fairy cakes… or a fairy cake lover.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s right—I will barter you if I have to.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh… OK—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Guard! Guard!
SEA:
The door swings open and you see a different guard poke his head in.
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
Keep it down!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I would… but I have a very good offer to make to you, my dear friend.
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
All right. This is going to be good.
SEA:
He turns to someone else, goes,
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
I’ll be right back out.
SEA:
And he steps in, leaving the door open, and walks over, stops about five feet away from the cell.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You see like a man of refined taste. Do you have a sweet tooth perhaps?
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
(grunts)
I like meat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Meat is good. Meat is close enough. So! What my lovely assistant here has this little pouches a collection of the finest dessert items you could ever come across. These are, dare I say, magical dessert items, each with its own special surprise properties. Perhaps we could interest you in not one, not two, not three, but the entire satchelful—shut up Eggerton, I swear to God shut up—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But—OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Then perhaps if we give you this pouch—
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
That sounds good.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We can perhaps forget to lock the cell door and point us out of the portcullis. What do you say, my good friend?
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
I think this sounds good.
SEA:
And he turns and picks up a bow, pulls an arrow, points it straight at you, and he’s like,
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
Toss the pouch out.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I did not foresee this happening.
(aside to Darcy)
Throw him the pouch. Just give him the pouch, Darcy.
MARIS:
And Darcy’s just looking at Blat with the most ferocious eyes, because she does feel the fairy cakes are of some value to their party.
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
There’s three of you. I’ve got three arrows here.
MARIS:
So Darcy pulls out the pouch. And she pushes it through the bars.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whimpers)
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
Kick it a little further.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And she drops it and kicks it a bit closer to him.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh no…
SEA:
He looks at you, he’s like,
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
It would have been fun to shoot you.
SEA:
And he puts the bow down, takes the pouch and walks outside.
SEAN (AS THE GUARD)
Heh heh. I don’t know—this might be poisoned. Who wants to try it?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(viciously)
All right. Fairy. Demon. Sit down and shut up.
MARIS:
And again Darcy’s hair is just getting almost straight up now and the eyes are just glowing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Now listen. We actually need a plan. Obviously the guards aren’t going to let us out of here. Ananka isn’t going to magically transport us out of here. Your fairy cakes are gone. So let’s think through this. When we came in, there was someone else in here.
MARIS:
Where is this prisoner? This other prisoner you mentioned?
SEA:
The next cell over.
MARIS:
Oh, just right beside us, watching all this lunacy?
SEA:
Yeah.
Actually, no! The person is sort of hunched over and is seems to be driving with a stone on the wall of of their… The back wall of the building.
MARIS:
So Darcy crouches down beside the open bars, right near where this person is.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… Hey. Hello. Hello?
SEAN (AS THE PRISONER)
(uncertain, anxious mumbling)
Uh… Yes, yes? Uh… must draw…
SEA:
And you notice the whole back wall of this person’s cell is a very familiar shape. Over and over. It is the city of Steadfast, as seen from above. The four-petaled flower shape that you know so well, twining around itself—which is drawn on almost every building, every piece of guards’ clothing… and it is drawn over and over again on the back wall of the cell next to you.
MARIS:
So I look over at the two, the demon and the fairy and I don’t say anything but I gesture at the wall, hoping that they’ll notice, even though Eggerton is weeping slightly…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sobs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What’s your name?
SEAN (AS THE PRISONER)
I must draw. I must draw. I must draw.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are you drawing?
SEAN (AS THE PRISONER)
What? Oh… I don’t know. I don’t know!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I believe he may have drawn my apartment complex!
MARIS:
Can you describe this person a bit more?
SEA:
You’ve never seen them, ever. Sort of dirty clothing, sort of hunched over, maybe 30s? Like, a drunkard.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How… How could they know about Steadfast?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wait. They said that there might be two other people coming—this might be one of those people!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
In this cell.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well we’re in this cell.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello. Hello! How how long have you been in this cell?
SEA:
The person is banging their head against the wall as they draw, over and over.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
I don’t know if this person is going to be much help. Does anyone have any ideas, not Eggerton… Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, my idea got rid of the fairy cake, so while that hasn’t solved anything, I feel as if we’ve removed a future problem.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I still have the fairy cake in my pocket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
Could someone strip search him next time? He’s still loaded with fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But maybe if we give one of the fairy cake to this drawing individual, they’ll be able to tell us a bit more.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, fairy cake it up. That’s the only card we have to play.
SEA:
OK, so I need you to roll Fairy Cake for me, for the guards, Eggerton…
MIK:
For the guards?
MARIS:
Oh, to see if we get—oh, darn it.
MIK:
That’s 11 for the guards.
SEA:
Yeah, they’re doing great.
MARIS:
No, but that might be good for us!
SEA:
They’re having a party outside with the fairy cakes. No adverse effects, because that’s a complete success.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right, Eggerton. This doesn’t seem like the worst plan in the universe. So why don’t you give me the fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. This is a Snappie flavored one, because I remember you were sad that you couldn’t have Snappies the other day, so I made it special for you and I was saving it for later—
MARIS:
And I just grab the fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sadly)
Oh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… Hello. You must be hungry! Would you like some cake?
MARIS:
And I put my hand gently through the bar.
SEA:
Okay let’s roll Parley. Let’s do it as Parley.
MARIS:
It’s a 7. And what would I get a plus on?
SEA:
You would get a plus…
MARIS:
On handing things to people.
(laughs)
MIK:
Charisma.
SEA:
Charisma. You’re trying to break through.
MARIS:
I have zero Charisma.
SEA:
So it’s a partial success, so I’ll say you catch their attention.
MARIS:
OK.
SEA:
Then they go right back to writing, but they’re like looking at you a little now. But they’re going they’re just writing and writing harder, and they’re bashing their head a little harder against the back wall, a trickle of blood coming down as they’re continuing to draw.
MARIS:
OK, so I take a little piece of the fairy cake and I—just a little piece!—and I eat it, and I go,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Mmmm! Num, num num. This is so good. I think it even has purply pinky sprinkles. Are you sure you don’t want any of this?
SEA:
And they reach out a hand towards you.
MARIS:
OK, and I gently give them a piece of the fairy cake…
SEA:
Very hesitantly, they’re looking at you the whole time and they lick it…
MARIS:
And I’m nodding,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes it’s good, isn’t it? And they bite into it. Roll Fairy Cake, please.
MIK:
Fairy cake!
He rolls.
SEA:
Oh God.
MIK:
That is a 4.
SEA:
OK. So then they go back to bashing their head into the wall and drawing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
I don’t know. This doesn’t seem to be working. I can’t get their attention.
SEA:
It was a great idea! Bad fairy cake.
MIK:
Yeah.
SEA:
Been sitting in the pocket too long.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello! You from Steadfast come. We come also! You draw apartment building. You know local dry cleaner?
SEA:
No response, just drawing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey, Blat Blat, I know you’re not too happy with me right now, but I had a question for you. If you don’t mind, I’d like to ask you that question, but I don’t want to get yelled at again.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, we have nothing but time. Go ahead and ask me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So you know how sometimes when there’s zombies or flowers or trees, and you say “Bazooka!” And then a bazooka appears… Could you maybe be like “Key!” And a key would appear? Or like, “Bolt cutters!” Or something like that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m not a wizard!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thanks to being half-demonic, I have what has been referred to as a “soul bound weapon”—not something that my mother ever told me about—but that’s it.
SEA:
(laughing)
With good reason. It’s a bazooka!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now… it’s possible—Wait! Wait! I have an idea!
PREMONITIO:
SEA:
Hold on that…
So Ananka, you are wracked—so just go with however you want to go with it—with an even stronger premonition. As if the Shattering is about to reach out and touch the three.
Moira’s just walking up with a book.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I found a third book of a third variation… Ananka! Are you OK?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Moira, it’s… No, the book, forget it. No.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Ananka!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I have a horrible…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Blood is coming down from your eyes!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
There is a horrible vision—it is happening. There is a blackness. I don’t think this is pure anymore. It is not—it is not untouched. There is darkness, it is… it is spreading. It is spreading there. If we don’t get them out, they will… We will lose our—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
OK. OK. Deep breaths, deep breaths. Let me get some water. Are you able to talk to them right now.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Hello. Is anybody there? Fairy? Fairy boy?
Blat?
We have to get them out.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
OK.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
It is not safe. There is a blackness. That is all I can say—it is all I can see. I can only see the blackness. It is spreading slowly
It is—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Ananka. We only have one Hunter left. And it’s Greg.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Not Grishka. Not again.
MIDROLL: MERC:
Midroll theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time… and Other Bothers.
A knock at the door.
CARTE:
Hello?
MIK:
Hey Carter, it’s Mike. I’ve got the new shipment of merchandise for The End of Time and Other Bothers.
CARTE:
Now, do podcasts usually have a lot of merchandise?
MIK:
Oh yeah I mean a lot of the other ones have t‑shirts and shoes and parachute bags but I thought we could try some really cool inventive stuff I saw online.
CARTE:
So next-level podcast merchandise.
MIK:
You have no idea.
OK, first so I’ve got, well I’ve got a couple t‑shirts because you need those.
CARTE:
Sure, yeah.
MIK:
And then I’ve got this paper airplane with a dagger on the front of it.
CARTE:
…I’m sorry, could you walk me through that?
MIK:
So the way it works is you fold it up…
CARTE:
Right.
MIK:
Right? It comes with the sheet of paper that has hashtag #OtherBothers all over it, because want people using that. And then you glue this super-sharp dagger to the front of it, and you throw it with your friends.
CARTE:
Isn’t going to just immediately fall to the floor because it’s just a piece of paper with a large knife at the front?
MIK:
Well that’s why we came up with Blat’s Guide to Knife Throwing. This book is going to sell like hot cakes. I have no doubt about it.
CARTE:
But at no point does Blat throw a knife in the series.
Silence.
MIK:
So we also have these light up mugs! And when you put them down and they’re empty, the ceiling above—look, you can see it says right there: patreon.com/albasalix. It says it on the ceiling because of the mug.
CARTE:
Why would you want to have one of those?
MIK:
Why wouldn’t you want to have one of those?
Another knock at the door.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT (SEAN)
Five-minute call! Hey guys… Hey! Eggerton! You’re in Blat’s trailer.
MIK:
Yeah.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT (SEAN)
We’ll get you into a trailer one day, I promise, Eggerton.
MIK:
That’s what you guys keep saying…
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT (SEAN)
We’re going to get you a trailer, don’t you worry. So, five-minute call, Blat. Hey, did we get that—we got the new heat sinking killer drones in stock?
MIK:
Yeah! These are the best. All you have to do is rate and review on iTunes and it will target your enemies and destroy them.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT (SEAN)
(impressed)
Ho ho!
CARTE:
This can’t be legal at all.
MIK:
It’s totally fine, totally fine. Here. Why don’t you take one of these, buddy, and you can just go show Sean.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT (SEAN)
I’m going to totally do that. All right. I’m going to turn it on.
Bye guys. Five-minute call!
MIK:
Now… let me show you the battle axes.
CARTE:
No no no. I’m good. I’m good!
Music sting.
VISITOR:
SEA:
We come back to the sound as Blat raises a finger high into the air with:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I know it’s probably not wise to fire off a bazooka in here in such close quarters. Don’t look at me like that, Darcy. But a large metal tube with the shell removed might be strong enough to batter down this door.
Silence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine.
SEA:
And that is when the door opens.
And a shadow fills it and you hear a silence outside. All the workers have stopped. The guards aren’t talking. And a figure steps into the room, wearing dress shoes that clap softly on the cobbles. A rather nondescript gentleman with a small nose, fastidiously dressed in layers of robes of silver and gold, and fingers adorned with an insane number of rings… and the darkest, blackest eyes you’ve ever seen. As if the color in the room is being sucked into them.
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
(low and menacing)
Are these them?
SEA:
You hear a guard from outside go:
SEAN (AS A GUARD)
(anxiously)
Yes, Chancellor!
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
Hmm. What are your names?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hi I’m Eggerton—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(hastily interrupting)
EggerSON, EggerSON. And I of course am Frank… this is, uh, my sister-in-law Agatha.
We are a traveling ventriloquist troupe.
MARIS:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
He’s very good. I’m not the one speaking right now it’s the shorter with fellow, ha ha. Quite talented aren’t we? Well, we’ve taken up too much of your time. Perhaps you can let us go and we’ll never come to your county again.
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger, Blat.
MARIS:
Ooo!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s a 12!
SEA:
Perfect roll.
A grinding bass note, as we heard when the zombies in the forest spoke.
SEA:
You feel his mind connecting into yours. You feel yourself losing yourself into his eyes.
And then all of a sudden he’s just—it’s like he’s thrown backwards and you actually, everyone else sees him stagger back a few steps and shake his head. And he uncricks his neck and he looks at Blat even more intensely.
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
No one has thrown me out before.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(suddenly cocky)
Well, no one’s tried to enter my mind before. But that’s just what a half-demon mind can do!
So Chancellor, clinky-clinky with the key and we won’t bother you any longer.
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
Hmm. How did you arrive in this kingdom?
MARIS:
I have a question first of all. Is this the voice that Darcy heard in her head when she cast the spell on the undead?
SEA:
No…
MARIS:
OK.
SEA:
But the eyes are the same.
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
How did you arrive in my kingdom?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We have these neat little things and they can turn them and then—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yep, they’re called puppets! Puppets with the ventriloquist troupe. We have many of them and we can make them talk—
(whispers)
For God’s sakes keep him quiet!
MARIS:
And Darcy goes round Eggerson—
(laughs)
Eggerson!
Laughter.
MARIS:
I’ve totally bought into it immediately, that’s how charismatic Blat is. Darcy goes around behind Eggerton and just pulls him back, holding him really tight and sort of putting her arm around his shoulder and almost blocking his mouth.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Good work, Agatha! And as you can see, even though it appears his mouth is closed, I am still talking. Ooo, the talent! It would be a shame if we didn’t make our next performance day at the local children’s hospital, so…
Again, please let us out and we shall be on our way. Do you like fairy cakes at all?
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
This storyverse belongs to my master.
SEA:
And he turns and starts to leave the room, clacking out.
Silence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did he just say “storyverse”?
SEA:
You hear him speak to a guard:
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
Kill them. Now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He definitely said “Kill them now.” I heard that one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t want to be killed now.
SEA:
You hear swords being drawn outside.
MARIS:
I release my grasp on Eggerton.
SEAN (AS A GUARD)
Yes Chancellor.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh Lord. Everyone against the wall. Against the back wall. Backs against the wall…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, I’m against the wall.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, this is a terrible idea.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
Blat’s bazooka appears.
SEA:
And you all see this time, this bazooka materialize out of the air from on his shoulder all the way down to just sitting perfectly in Blat’s hand, the trigger right under his finger as a screen pops up. You see forms starting to block the doorway…
CARTE:
I’m just going to aim at the doorway. I’m waiting for the door to open. If I see that—
SEA:
The door is open. He didn’t close it so the door…
CARTE:
The cell door is what I’m aiming for, yes. So I’m waiting for the cell door to open and if it opens, it’s fire at will.
SEA:
And two guards are stepping in, and one of them’s like:
SEAN (AS FIRST GUARD)
What… Where’d he get that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Where did I get this? Ventriloquists are quite tricksy, aren’t they? Please don’t listen to… Creepy Blacky-Eye. Just let us go or I’ll be forced to use this.
SEA:
Two more are starting to come in the door and the two are stopped in the doorway.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This is not just a metal tube, I assure you. This is a tube of badness. Just open the door and let us go, or I’ll be forced to pull the trigger of doom.
SEAN (AS SECOND GUARD)
I don’t like this. I don’t know what that is.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Trigger of doom!
SEA:
They’re slowly backing up.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Unlock the cell door and you can back up. You. You! Do you have keys? You have keys. Get keys, give that one keys, up front.
SEAN (AS SECOND GUARD)
I don’t know what that is.
SEA:
And they’re all backing up, pouring out the door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
One of you has to have keys! Come back with keys!
SEA:
And they slam the door. You hear a lot of murmuring going outside.
SEAN (AS GUARDS)
Fan out! Maybe he’s coming out!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This is just great.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I thought you said that you could take the thing out and then we could use it to bang down the door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, we could try that. Help me get the shell out of this thing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh… What’s a shell?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…It’s fine. I’ll do it.
CARTE:
So Blat begins unscrewing and taking apart the bazooka and getting the shell out so he doesn’t blow us all to kingdom come. And with that—
SEA:
And what’s going to happen if you damage the bazooka, Blat? Do you know?
CARTE:
No idea! No idea at all. Is it a new one that comes every time? I’m just guessing but I don’t know.
SEA:
OK.
CARTE:
I’ll remove the shell, I’ll gently place it at the far corner of the cell, put the bazooka back together and then use it to just start hammering away at the cell door.
SEA:
And you hear voices out, sort of like shouting, you hear guards talking back. It’s a lot of craziness and you start bashing at the door. OK, so what would that be?
CARTE:
That would be Strength, I suppose.
MIK:
Hack and Slash?
SEA:
Yes, let’s Hack and Slash it with a Strength bonus.
CARTE:
Well, it would be a Strength negative.
MARIS:
Why?
CARTE:
Because my Strength is only 8 so that’s a ‑1. I didn’t have to do much in the way of physical labor or a cell door bashing in my life as a file clerk.
(rolling)
Come on, baby! Let’s cell door our way out. That would be a 7, which is actually a 6.
SEA:
Yeah. So you’re banging and slamming and you’re denting up your—it’s not as strong as you had hoped. And so yeah, you’re bashing it up, the screen snaps… and the door is still there.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I have a question. Did anyone check to see if it was locked.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
MIK:
So I walk forward and sort of try and finagle with the handle.
SEA:
It’s locked.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. Just wanted to make sure.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Just wait a minute.
MARIS:
And I turn my dial to comm. And I say:
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello? Ananka? Ananka?
A beep.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(over the medallion comm)
Yes, hello, I am here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ananka, we’re stuck in this cell and this, this really creepy guy—I think he called himself a Chancellor, or someone called him a Chancellor?—came in and talked to us and he was really scary Ananka. I got a really bad feeling. Do you know what’s going on? Do you know we can get out of this? They now want to kill us.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
If the storyverse is correct… I believe there is a ghoul. Something has infected this place.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you know anything about—there’s a person here in a cell beside us and they seem to know about Steadfast. Do you know anything about that person?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I cannot see. I do not see. I’m… I’m sorry I do not. I do not see.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So we have to get out of this cell. That seems to be apparent. That’s the first problem.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Yes. This may sound crazy but… maybe you can tell—you can answer three questions. Your training. Three questions that you could answer.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you two know what she’s talking about?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel like I’m on a game show all of a sudden!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Three questions? Tell us who the sketch artist is! Who’s Blacky-Eye? How do we get out of this cell? Don’t ask me how many fish I can name!
SEA:
You hear Moira in the background going:
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(frantic)
They haven’t finished training, Ananka! They were plebes! Here’s another book…
SEA:
You guys hear the front door to the guard shack being opened.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK Ananka, I’m going to keep this on comm! If you have anything call me back but we need to start figuring out something right now!
Blat, can you recall another bazooka?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I have absolutely no idea.
CARTE:
I take the busted bazooka and I throw it to the side of the cell and I just call out:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
SEA:
And a brand new bazooka materializes out of the air onto your shoulder and into your hands.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh thank heavens, at least that’s operating correctly.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Get us out of this cell.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right.
Everyone’s back against the wall?
SEA:
And the door opens and you hear:
SEAN (AS THE CONSORT)
(bold and flamboyant)
I don’t care what you say. I said stand down. Back up.
You’d better put your sword away before the Consort!
SEA:
And you hear a guard going:
SEAN (AS A GUARD)
Yes, yes, Consort…
SEA:
And you see a figure, a much smaller figure, stepping into the doorway.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Put the bazooka down. Blat, put the bazooka down.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m not doing anything until I see his eyes. What do his eyes look like? Then I’ll put the bazooka down.
SEA:
So you see a rather beautiful man. Hard to tell his age, early 30s? His face is angelic. His eyes dance over a mouth that seems to always show his mood. And he’s got long blonde hair and he’s wearing a long robe that seems pretty ornate. He’s like,
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Hello, visitors?
SEA:
And he’s like stepping in as if his eyes are adjusting.
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Hello. Oh, there you are. My apologies. I am Consort Varnos. And you are?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Pissed off. What colour are your eyes?
SEA:
He sort of stands up a little straighter, he’s like—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Simple question—what colour are your eyes?
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Well, I like to say they’re hazel, but I’m told sometimes in the right light they’re aquamarine.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, fine.
CARTE:
And Blat puts the bazooka down.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hi… I’m Agatha.
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Hello Agatha. I am told that you proclaimed that you answered the riddle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…Sure.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think he means the sign.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. Fine. We did.
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Very well. Come. I will take you before King Pamir.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And suddenly it’s all very simple. All right, let’s go see King Pramir.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Can I have my fairy cakes back—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No. You cannot eat another fairy cake for the rest of the day.
SEA:
You’re all just sort of standing there and then he’s like,
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Oh right, the door. Guards! The door, please!
SEA:
You see a guard sort of coming into the doorway. He’s like,
SEAN (AS A GUARD)
Um… but Consort, we were told by the…
SEA:
And he says,
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
I don’t care what you were told. I have given you an order. They are to appear before the King.
SEA:
The guard comes forward and unlocks your door, sheepishly.
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
I’m not sure how much time we have. Not sure what’s going on here, but I like the cut of your jib. What was your name?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um… my name was… Phil? Phil! My name was—is Phil. And, uh… excuse my lack of shirt.
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Oh, I’m enjoying that part, Phil.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(an uncomfortable sigh)
CARTE:
Blat puts his wings more in front of his chest, creating the right-side-up bat with pants effect again, as he drags his bazooka tube behind him.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, one question. What’s the sketch artist in here for?
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
I’m not sure.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Maybe, um… They seem like a good egg. Why doesn’t the sketch artist come along with us?
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Are they with you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yup. Um, they were actually the ones that solved the riddle. We were like, “Oh of course, the riddle! How easy!” …so yes.
SEA:
He gestures and the guard unlocks that cage.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Agatha. Yes. See to our good friend, um… Mademoiselle Tibbert.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
You really are a horrible liar, but I love it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughs nervously)
MARIS:
So I go into the cell, and I gently pick up this person…
SEA:
They’re quite light.
MARIS:
And when I say pick up, I don’t mean I’m lifting them off the ground…
SEA:
They’re quite frail for their age.
MARIS:
OK, so then I guide them gently.
SEA:
OK. They’re sort of murmuring, along with trying to still draw in the air, but you’re guiding them along.
And so Varnos leads you out into the light and you see there must be forty guards, and they’re all sort of hands on their weapons, until Varnos looks at them to them and they all step back. And he just starts walking, regally, up towards the main keep.
MARIS:
Do they have fairy cake crumbs all over their mouths?
SEA:
There are fairy cake crumbs.
MIK:
I see the one with my pouch and I run over.
SEA:
He takes a step back quite suddenly, shaking.
MIK:
And I say,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Give ’em.
SEA:
He just holds the pouch out for you.
MIK:
I snatch it, I look inside, nod and run back to the group.
THE THRONE ROO:
SEA:
So you guys are following Consort Varnos up towards the main keep. It’s an equally impressive structure of flags and gleaming gold accents and again, perfectly white stone.
So as you walk up to the main entrance, two guards, dressed differently, stomp their feet and the doors swing open into a foyer that is the size of a small cathedral, with 60-foot vaulted ceilings, though it’s not that long of a room—and then start walking forward. You’re trying to stay up, I assume, with Varnos. He’s just like—doesn’t even pause. As if he owns the place. And he’s just heading for the next set of doors.
MARIS:
I’m just following along with this frail person beside me.
SEA:
Who’s trying to draw in the air.
MARIS:
Right, who’s trying to draw in the air.
MIK:
I’m counting fairy cookies and cakes, and looking for different types of sprinkles.
SEA:
OK. So Blat, you’re probably the only one to really have a chance, because you’re waiting on Darcy, with this person, and Eggerton’s stumbling along because he’s trying to count fairy cakes at the same time. And you probably hear some of this as well, Ananka.
But you notice as you step up the steps to go into the main keep, looking back at the structure being built in the centre of the courtyard is that same—it is the outline of Steadfast.
CARTE:
Hmm.
SEA:
And as you enter into the main keep, assuming you’re all going in?
CARTE:
Yeah.
SEA:
Because there’s a lot of guards out there watching you and they’re sort of like, not keeping pace but moving a little towards the keep.
Varnos walks right towards the next set of doors, which swing open immediately and you hear a horn being played. And you enter the Grand Hall. And every whisper of movement echoes across this hall. There are inlaid tiles with crazy patterns of entire stories, as far as you can see, in this massive hall, about 100-foot high vaulted ceilings.
There are two thrones in the far centre of the room. And there is a somewhat older gentleman, not too old, on one of the thrones, wearing a crown. And Consort Varnos walks right up and spins around and sits in the other one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat, they ate fourteen and a half fairy cakes. And that’s too many fairy cakes for that many people who have never had them before—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Get on one knee. Get on one knee.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’re in front of royalty, get on one knee.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
One knee?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just get on one knee.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Everyone, one-knee it. One-knee it.
MARIS:
So Darcy gets down on one knee, but the person I’m with has trouble.
SEA:
Yeah they’re just standing there drawing in the air.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I get down on one knee.
SEA:
A hand is placed on your shoulder and an older gentleman says,
SEAN (AS HERALD)
How should I announce you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um… I am Phil and this is our ventriloquist troupe.
SEA:
OK. Roll Parley. You get a Charisma bonus.
CARTE:
That’s a 9.
SEA:
OK. So the gentleman steps back.
SEAN (AS HERALD)
Your Royal Highness, I give you… Phil and his traveling ventriloquist group.
Laughter.
SEA:
And a hush falls on the room as King Pamir sort of stops talking with someone beside him, and turns and gestures for you all to approach.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Come on up. Come on up. And nothing about fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No fairy cakes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just pretend you have another interest for just five minutes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Could you get Scribbly here to stop drawing in the air?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! I can’t!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
SEA:
So you’re walking up. You see King Pamir is slightly balding, middle-aged, carries himself pretty regally, sitting there, but his shoulders are hunched as if under an unseen weight. And Varnos is whispering in his ear as you approach.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Greetings and salutations, Your Majesty! We are but traveling entertainers who have come to witness the splendor of your kingdom.
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
Varnos tells me that you claim the riddle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes! The riddle said to come not by foot, so… as you can see I’m a wingèd individual, and thus I came your to fine castle in that fashion.
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
I see. Did you enter the castle by wing then?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just outside the castle, I met your guards and… oh, what a time we had! With the royal iron cage that I was wheeled in upon.
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
Why by chance were you arrested?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Racism, Your Honour! I—
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
I’m not asking you. Captain of the Guard, if you would?
SEA:
And a man steps forward and walks up and is whispering in his other ear.
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
Those are hefty charges against you, Phil.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I believe it is my demonic appearance that is the reason why I was arrested and thrown into your cell.
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
My kingdom is troubled.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
With racism.
Laughter.
SEA:
And the doors swing open behind you, and you feel a chill in the room.
MARIS:
(sotto voce)
Chancellor…
SEA:
And there’s a hush that falls across the room, and the Chancellor’s voice rings out.
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
Your Highness. I was hoping to save you from this unfortunate experience… of these vagabonds.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ventriloquists, actually.
CARTE:
Blat puts one of his wings up over his face to cover a quick aside he’s going to have with Darcy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(whispers)
Didn’t we hear something about the silver beetle doing something against the dark?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
Do you think he’s a dark Shattering-person?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t think his eyes are like that naturally, no.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well then, yes. How am I going to get the beetle on him?
MIK:
I tug at Blat’s other wing.
Laughter.
MARIS:
This is so subtle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey guys, there’s there’s a thing on the amulets, remember? We can detect! We can detect if something’s with the Shattering.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(clenched teeth)
Then why don’t you turn it to Detect?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Without having to tell us about it, and being a bit more subtle about this?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But mine’s out of power, because I was talking with the nice lady.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine, I’ll turn mine to Detect.
(aloud)
We’re just practicing our act! We’re so sorry, we want it to be fully polished for Your Highness. We will be with you in mere seconds.
MARIS:
And Darcy, with the cover of Blat’s wings, turns her medallion to Detect.
SEA:
Yours is dead.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? It’s dead.
MARIS:
The problem is, Darcy wouldn’t know that, because it could just mean there’s no Shattering.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I haven’t used mine yet. I’ll set mine to Detect.
SEA:
And as the Chancellor is stepping past you and speaking, it vibrates so hard you can actually hear it in the hall, echoing—BZZZT! BZZZT! Like a cellphone going off, it’s vibrating so strong and it is pulsing black as the Chancellor walks past you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So I quickly set it back to Recharge…
SEA:
But everyone freezes, including the chancellor, who turns to look at you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(awkwardly)
That is an amazing sound you’re doing, Phil! I don’t know how you managed to project that through the whole room. I think we need to incorporate that into our act!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Practice! Practice is the reason why that happened.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Just… just incredible. Did everyone hear that? It’s simply Phil doing that noise. Isn’t that incredible, everyone?
They applaud faintly.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you. Thank… yes. Big round of applause for constant rehearsal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Woo! Thank you.
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
They practice dark magic, Your Majesty. Please allow us to remove them from your kingdom.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Not dark magic, Your Majesty! Simply acrobatic vocal chords, if I may, that’s all that is. That’s all it is.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But! Your Majesty, there is a new aspect of our act that we’re just going to try now… My dear partner Agatha is working on a very simplistic juggling routine with fine ornate figurines.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Please, Agatha—
SEA:
Varnos is clapping.
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Please, Pen, let them, Pen… I want to see an act.
(shouts)
I want to see you juggle, demon!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Of course you do.
Agatha, if you could please hand me the special juggling prop?
SEA:
The king raises his hand and sits back down and says,
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
I will allow it.
SEA:
And he leans over and whispers something to Varnos, who giggles and they seem to be caught up with each other while you prepare your act.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I think if you’re going to juggle, Phil, you’ll need more than one… so, Eggerton, I think you’ll have to pass over your ornate juggling ball as well.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh yes, my ornate juggling ball that I have as part of our ventriloquist act, because that’s who we are! We’re ventriloquists…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton! Just hand it over.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, OK, here you go.
SEA:
The Chancellor is just staring at you. He’s like,
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
(hisses)
You will be mine.
SEA:
He’s just talking between his teeth.
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
You will be mine. This storyverse is ours.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes! I will be yours, and you will be my… volunteer from the audience!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes!
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So, if I could just get the two juggling props from my two assistants, Agatha and Eggerson…
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
I don’t want to be in your act!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just a moment, please, it’s very good.
OK, Scribbly, if you could just get out of my way here—that’s very good, what you’re doing into thin air.
MARIS:
And I hand over my beetle…
MIK:
I pass mine over over.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now, as you can see, ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing up my sleeves, because I do not have a shirt on. Here are my wings spread open wide—
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Oh, I like this part!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now then, Chancellor…
SEA:
You see King Pamir frowning a little. And Varnos is like,
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
Oh, relax! I’m just looking.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Chancelor, if you could just… open your hands for me…
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
(growls)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’re just going to try catching this and, uh… we’ll see what happens when that happens. Alley… oop!
CARTE:
And instead of tossing it underhanded, I just whip it at him as hard as I can.
SEA:
All right, so it bounces off of him… He’s like,
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
Agh! What is that? I’ve been attacked!
SEA:
Varnos is like,
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
That wasn’t an attack! Catch it!
MARIS:
And so Darcy looks over at Blat, and then she starts a very awkward sort of dancing movement, as if she’s kind of being the presenter-assistant.
Laughter.
SEA:
The Chancellor is bending down and looking this strange beetle.
MARIS:
And she’s sort of going,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(hums circus music)
A‑deet deet do do doo, doot doot do do dee…
MARIS:
And she starts dancing awkwardly towards the Chancellor, very smiley.
SEA:
Who’s paying you no mind. He’s staring at this beetle.
MARIS:
And so I come over and go,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Whew! So sorry about that!
MARIS:
And I pick up the beetle and I gesture to:
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Phil! You must try the second volley!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Heh. Yes! The second volley!
SEA:
He turns and he’s watching Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Chancellor! Here’s another one! Get ready, and—
CARTE:
I pretend to throw it for a second, just to catch him off guard,
MARIS:
and then,
CARTE:
when he flinches,
MARIS:
Darcy takes the beetle and clamps it on his arm, and makes the mechanism…
SEA:
Activates it?
MARIS:
Activates the mechanism, thank you.
The beetle’s legs snap shut. It beeps.
SEA:
You hear a shunk! And you hear him go,
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
Aaagh!
A huge wave of energy.
SEA:
And he arches back, and he literally explodes in—it’s like a wave of blackness that buffets you all back. People are thrown against walls.
And then it dissipates. And there is no Chancellor.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(weakly)
Doot doot do do doo…
SEA:
And Varnos is like,
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
(applauding wildly)
Best day ever!!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ta dah!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that’s our act, ladies and gentlemen! We’ll be doing another show in 30 minutes.
THE GARDE:
SEA:
Cut to… you are in a waiting room, and there are drinks, there are a few people and you are talking with Varnos, who is ushering over the king, King Pamir. And the king walks over and he’s like,
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
Hmm. Again, I’m not sure how you’re going to bring back the Chancellor…
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, heh… It’s the code of the performer. When such acts of magic are performed, we can’t reveal our secrets! That would ruin the show.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, it’s not like we’re some kind of lame improv troupe or something.
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
Don’t hurry up with doing that part, OK?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh absolutely. We’ll maintain the mystery as long as we can.
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
I really didn’t like what they were building out front. Much better this way.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, yes. Very good.
Um… Is Scribbly free to remain with us for the moment?
SEA:
(laughing)
There’s just this person drawing on the walls of the palace in the background.
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
Yes, in fact the sooner Scribbly goes with you, would be great.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me, Your Majesty, but what are they building in the courtyard?
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
(thoughtful)
We are not sure what it is. The chancellor said it was a monument to a god that we had never heard of. Everything seemed to make sense when the Chancellor was around. But enough of him.
If you would please humour an old king… there is someone who wishes to speak with you all. Someone who spoke the words of the prophecy that foretold of you coming and saving us.
SEA:
And the king leads you out of the antechamber, and he waves off the guards, and down the hall and up a spiral staircase, and pauses before a door carved with a beautifully intricate tree… and opens it.
And as you follow you step out into a garden—but a garden quite majestic, because you are so high up you can see the valley spreading out in both directions. And the two mountains seem a little less tall on each side of you. It is a garden of just grass and giant trees that are somehow way up high on this palace.
There are a few little places to sit, and the king is walking towards a very large old apple tree that stands out, because all of the other trees are very sculpted and perfect, and this one is scraggly and it is very dense, way too dense for a tree—you can’t even see through the foliage. And he has stopped beneath it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I am not a fan of apples so I’m going to go stand over here and work on my ventriloquism.
Laughter.
MARIS:
Darcy just rolls her eyes.
SEA:
Are you guys walking up to the tree?
MARIS:
Yes.
CARTE:
Yep, I walk up to the tree.
MIK:
I’m going to take the opportunity to turn on my comm.
SEA:
OK. We’ll do that.
(to Ananka)
The connection goes green on the comms to you. You suddenly can speak.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
My three! Oh my God. Are you OK? What happened? I could not speak to any of you. I could not see anything. What has happened? Are you OK?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re ventriloquists now!
SEA:
(laughs)
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Oh! Not so bad career. In one of my lives, I also did a little bit of a sideshow. So, OK! It turned out pretty good.
Where are you now? Are you safe?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We are near a tree and it’s got apples on it and in my experience apples can be rude and bullies so I’m going to stay away. But they’re talking with the king because there was a riddle and we knew the answer and then the chancellor had black eyes and we put one of the devices on him and then he went away and there was a little song and dance and this one guy really liked it. And there was a flower they were building that looked like Steadfast but now they’re not going to make it anymore. And the slaves, they’re not going to be slaves anymore because the king seems like a kind of OK guy, but now he’s over by the apples and I don’t like apples. So I thought I’d call and say hi. How are you?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(laughs)
Fairy boy, I have never been happier to hear your voice. I’m so happy you are all OK. It sounds like you have drawn out the poison. It sounds like maybe it is safe to bring back the artifact.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So, about the artifact… What what exactly are we talking about?
SEA:
And that’s when your comm dies.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aww, geez.
MARIS:
So short!
SEA:
It takes a lot of power to talk between dimensions, people!
Laughter.
MIK:
They don’t make interdimensional communication devices like they used to.
MARIS:
That’s right.
SEA:
Blat and Darcy, you are walking up to the tree with the king.
MARIS:
Yes.
SEA:
So he’s standing there at the tree, and he says,
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
Don’t be afraid. It is an old friend. I will leave you to talk.
SEA:
And he turns and starts walking back just around the garden. He’s like,
SEAN (AS KING PAMIR)
I’ll be nearby if you need me.
SEA:
And you hear a rustling up in the tree and suddenly a face pops out and it is—you would know this, Blat—it is a full-on ancient ghoul, with sharp teeth and bloodshot eyes, and it’s just peering down, quite large, out of the tree, and it’s like,
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
(gruff, sneering voice)
Hah? Haaaah! Oh no.
Give me something to eat, demon!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Do you like fairy cakes at all?
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
Whatever. Anything from your hand.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Egger… son?
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
From your hand.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just a moment! I know the rules. Eggerson!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yep, I’m here!
MIK:
And I come running up.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fairy cake me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. But did you know there’s a there’s a big thing up there? Did you see him?
MARIS:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I know. I’m aware…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, OK, I just wanted to make sure we all knew…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fairy cake. Just put a fairy cake in my hand.
MIK:
And I reach in and I take a fairy cake out and I put it in his hand.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Here you are: something from my hand.
CARTE:
And he hands the cake to the ghoul.
SEA:
And he leans—the head comes way, way down. Giant head. The mouth opens.
MARIS:
Eee.
CARTE:
I just sort of drop it into his mouth.
SEA:
It closes, chomping.
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
(chewing noises)
And you too, woman of the—oh… You’re interesting. Feed me from your hand.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What? But you just had something—
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
Feed me from your hand!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, OK!
MARIS:
And I, in a panic, reach around my satchel, and luckily, one of Eggerton’s fairy cakes fell out of his pouch into my satchel. And I pull it out and—
SEA:
The mouth opens. Giant.
MARIS:
And I throw it in…
SEA:
It chews—
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
(chuckling)
Phil! Ha ha ha! That is a good one!
Well done. I did not expect you to be the one to answer my riddle. It was supposed to be a young girl.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
She’s a young girl, Agatha—
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
No she’s not.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh.
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
That’s the way of riddles.
Tell Ananka that Kuvatz…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Kuvatz.
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
…says thank you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you.
Kuvatz, one question. We were supposed to bring something back to Ananka—would you possibly know what that is?
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
I would!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s going to cost us something for you to tell us, isn’t it.
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
Not this time.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh!
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
You freed my kingdom and my story.
SEA:
And the head disappears with a rustle of branches, and then comes back and a small ball is dropped down.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I pick up the ball.
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
It is the ball the king used to play with up here, while he pined for a lover.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So not jewellery, or—
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
A ball!!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A ball it is, then! Yes, I’ll be sure to bring this back to our dimension.
CARTE:
And Blat holds onto the ball, bows.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you, Your—
SEA:
And the head disappears and is gone.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
—Ghoulish… ness.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I… I have questions for you, Blat, that perhaps you can answer.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I doubt I can, but go ahead.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um, why was there a giant head eating fairy cakes and why did he have a ball? And why was the King playing with a ball in the tree while thinking about a lover?
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Because life is complicated when you don’t have fairy cakes to distract you. Here, put this in your cake pouch. We’ll bring this back to Ananka.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. OK.
MIK:
And I put it into my pouch.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right let’s turn our dials to Transport and get out of here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, let’s see if this works…
CARTE:
And I set mine to Transport.
SEA:
OK. You’re all standing there, looking at each other.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wait, wait, wait. Get Scribbles here in the middle. Maybe if we all hold hands with Scribbles in the middle, all of us can go back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re really into Scribbles, huh?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel that Scribbles is important. If they know so much about Steadfast, maybe they can answer some questions.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe we should all hold onto an arm or a leg, at least have some physical contact with Scribbles.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, very good.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right, everyone put it on Transport and then we’ll all press the button together.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re all going to push one button together? Or we’re all going to push—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Your own button, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m going to push my own button.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And hold on to Scribbles.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK, I’ve got a foot.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ve got a hand.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You know what—you hold onto Scribbles, I’ll press Eggerton’s and mine at the same time just to be safe.
SEA:
(laughs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right. On the count of three. One!
MARISA AND CARTER (AS DARCY AND BLAT)
Two! Three!
The medallions click and beep. A huge roaring sound of the portal opening.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I knew we were friends!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I can feel everythiiiiiiing!!

ANNOUNCE:
Last time on the End of Time and Other Bothers…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Greetings and salutations, guardians of the castle! I am Blat, he’s a drunken idiot, and she’s wearing pants that are too big for her.
A metal cell door slams, and a latch slides into place.
SEA:
There does appear to be someone in the cell next to you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are you drawing?
SEAN (AS THE PRISONER)
(whimpers)
I don’t know!
SEA:
It is the city of Steadfast, as seen from above—the four-petaled flower shape.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
They said that there might be two other people coming—this might be one of those people!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re stuck in this cell and this, this really creepy guy—I think he called himself a Chancellor?
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
You will be mine. This storyverse is ours.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes! I will be yours, and you will be my… volunteer from the audience!
MARIS:
Darcy takes the beetle and clamps it on his arm…
The beetle’s metal legs snap shut. It beeps.
SEAN (AS THE CHANCELLOR)
Aaagh!
A huge wave of energy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ta dah!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that’s our act, ladies and gentlemen! We’ll be doing another show in 30 minutes.
SEAN (AS CONSORT VARNOS)
(applauding wildly)
Best day ever!!
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
You freed my kingdom and my story.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So, about the artifact… What what exactly are we talking about?
SEAN (AS THE GHOUL)
A ball!!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A ball it is, then! Yes, I’ll be sure to bring this back to our dimension.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right, let’s turn our dials to Transport and get out of here.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHE:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Moira, we come to you triumphant! Not only were we able to defeat the Shattering in that storyverse, but look! We’ve brought someone from our timeline.
(aside)
Scribbles? Come. Come, Scribbles.
All right! We don’t know Scribbles’ real name… or where they’re from exactly… or their gender—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Are they drawing pornography on my floor?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Heh. They weren’t doing that before. Scribbles, you might want to stop doing that. No, you see, we found Scribbles in the storyverse, drawing things from our era.
Now, you’ve mentioned that there were two other people from our era who were brought back, so we found one of them: Scribbles!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are these books important?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(aghast)
Oh God. Please! Not the books, they can draw on anything else. Not the books!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, Scribbles, away from the books. Let’s go in this direction. Follow the fairy cakes, Scribbles! Yum yum yum! Come over here…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Is that what I think it is?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m actually not sure if that is possib… Well, if you look at it from another directi… oh, yes, that is what you think it is.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Oh my.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry about your floor. It’s just we thought that Scribbles came from our era, so…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
So you were in a storyverse…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
And you found a… provocatively drawing character…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Again: wasn’t doing that before. But yes.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
And assumed that you should yank them out of that storyverse… because they would belong here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It was Blat’s idea.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So what you seem to be intimating is that, instead of doing a grand heroic deed—rescuing someone from a storyverse that they should not be in—you seem to be saying that we’ve grabbed a random person and brought them to another reality and are thus… kidnappers.
A long pause.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
…Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhh, I’ve done a bad thing.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Now, Ananka, would you say that this Scribbles was an integral part of the storyverse, which is probably now collapsing in on itself horrifically? Or maybe just a tertiary character that has caused minor damage to that storyverse?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I wouldn’t say he was very important. I think, you know, he is like footnote. So if we take him out, no one’s going to notice.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Well, I’ll notice! Look what he’s drawing on! That’s an original!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Lighten up, Moira. It’s the most action you’ve seen in 3000 years.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(sweetly)
Oh, Ananka, yes… Let’s talk about you, dear, and your sending them into a “perfectly safe world” that you had a “very clear vision” on.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Yes… in my mind it was clear. I don’t know what happened.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You ladies seem like you’ve got a lot going on… so maybe Eggerton and I’ll just get out of your hair for the time being.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes! And please take Scribbles with you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughs nervously)
Okay then.

Episode 8: Journey to the Temple, Part 1.
THE DESER:
Moody guitar music reminiscent of a western soundtrack.
SEA:
We find the adventurers! in the desert, following a road. They are bedraggled. They are covered in dust. Their clothing is faded and ripped. Their beards have grown—those who have beards. They have been traveling for many days.
In the lead we see Ananka, head bowed against the wind. Some steps behind, we see Darcy. Further behind we see Blat, smiling and skipping through the hot desert. And way, way back we see Eggerton huffing along following their path.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(weakly)
Slow down!
SEA:
So all of you are far southwest of Paradox. You have been traveling for five to seven days.
Ananka, it’s been a long time since you’ve been to see the Oracle, and the Oracle is only about five days away… and you’re going into your sixth or seventh day. It’s a bit confusing, with all the weather and everything. And what you do know is that the Oracle is across the border of Mediocria, which is a forested, pleasant area and not the desert. So your fear is that you might be a little off course, and heading into the Pointy Lands.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I feel we will be there soon. Let me just consult my vision.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There seems to be a lot of sand Ananka. A lot. A lot of sand.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m just glad we finally reached an area with a decent temperature. Ah, so pleasant!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Water, please…
(gasps)
Slow down. Water. Please…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(mildly)
You used all of your water to make your last batch of fairy cakes, didn’t you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You need fairy cakes for the desert… because it sounds kind of like dessert.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I suppose that’s true if you’re very bad at spelling. Just… try to suck moisture out of another fairy cake. Any excuse to eat a fairy cake, eh?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay!
MIK:
So I take a fairy cake out of my pouch, and I nibble on it for the moisture.
SEA:
Rolling fairy cakes.
MIK:
That is a 2.
Laughter.
MARIS:
Oh no…
SEA:
(laughing)
Now… I’m a little confused, because I believe Eggerton has a special ability about sustenance. Can you read me that ability before we deal…? We’re going to deal with the fairy cake incident. But…
MIK:
“You don’t need to eat or drink.”
Laughter.
MIK:
That’s the first sentence.
SEA:
Okay!
MIK:
So maybe we can redo a little bit of this…
SEA:
No!
MIK:
No? We’re just going to plough ahead?
SEA:
Who was it that said he’s Mr. Organized and had everything all neatly laid out?
CARTE:
I would like “does not need to eat or drink” stricken from the record.
Laughter.
MIK:
It’s emotional.
SEA:
So Eggerton starts to nibble on a cherry cake and then there’s a—
MARIS:
A cherry cake?
(laughs)
CARTE:
It’s a cherry fairy cake.
SEA:
It’s a cherry fairy cake!
MIK:
Cherry fairy cake.
SEA:
Eggerton starts to nibble on a cherry fairy cake, and there’s a gust of wind and he starts to choke.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(choking sounds)
Laughter.
SEA:
And his face is turning blue…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(more choking sounds)
MARIS:
Unfortunately I don’t notice because I’ve continued to plough ahead behind Ananka.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I can’t believe that a man of your size has problems with eating.
SEA:
He’s turning purple, Blat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(continued choking sounds)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
All right.
CARTE:
So I walk up slowly behind Eggerton, place my two hands… just on his stomach…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(still choking, but begins to crack up)
CARTE:
And begin pumping, in a rhythmic fashion, to the tune of a popular song from our era.
MIK:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(singing, casually)
Deh dit dit deh dit dit deh…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(rhythmic heaving sounds, then a spit and gasping breaths)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There, now being thirsty is the least of your problems.
SEA:
So I will say you don’t take any damage for that Eggerton. Everyone is at full. You have been—you’re miserable. Except for Blat, Blat seems pretty happy. There’s sand in everything: in your food, in your canteens, and your clothing…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The sand acts as an exfoliant!
SEA:
But you are all at full HP, just so you guys are all aware because it’s been many days since our last—
MARIS:
I feel like that’s going to become necessary.
SEA:
(laughing)
—after our last adventure. Okay… you were going to check your Sight?
MAGGI:
Okay.
SEA:
So you have an ability on the front of your sheet, which is called The Sight.
MAGGI:
Yes… yes.
It’s late afternoon, early evening. You would need to spend three hours, so you would need to set up camp… and be uninterrupted for three hours, which, I will point out—you haven’t had a lot of uninterrupted time on this trip.
MAGGI:
Right.
SEA:
You have these herbs you pull out and chants and you have to be left alone for three hours to roll for The Sight.
MAGGI:
Okay. So Ananka says, you know,
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I need to be alone for three hours. I need to figure this out and consult the Sight.
SEA:
So you hear Ananka say something about, “I need to be alone for three hours,” and she starts setting up a little lean-to…
MARIS:
And I think that’s fine because I could use a break, and that means I can do some communing with Loxsyn, who is my goddess. So I just sit down, a little ways away from Ananka, and cross my legs and close my eyes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are they sitting down in the middle of the road?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
I believe this is a religious break.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you want to continue our game of Candy World? I’ve got the board game in my bag.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(to himself)
Oh, how I wish I was a religious sort.
(to Eggerton)
Fine. Let us continue with Candy World.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. I had three green goojubes and you had seven.
MARIS:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes… I was winning, despite not really knowing or caring about the rules.
What can I do with my seven? Is there anything I can purchase to perhaps make this game end sooner?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, no. For every eight greens that you have, you can get one red, and if you get ten red you can get one purple swirly, and whoever has the most purple swirlys in the end wins.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I see. But if I have seven and you have fewer than that… does this not mean I’ve already won?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, it means you’re in the lead for now, but you never know what happens when we go around Fluff Top Mountain. See it’s here on the board, next to the Sea of…
MARIS:
So then three hours pass.
Crickets chirp in the background.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…and if you get more than ten, you get to go ahead and collect three reds. But if you only roll a 6 then you get two greens. And when you add all of those up at the end of the session we redistribute, and ultimately if you have all of the purple swirlys, then you win—but first we have to get around the mountain, so you go ahead and roll.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, I’ll just roll quickly here.
Oh, a 13! Oh, good for me. I’ve made it all the way around.
(stretching)
Well! Ahhhh. That was a great session. Purple swirlys all around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The dice only go up to 12…
Laughter.
BLA:
Don’t know how that happened but… yep, I did it. Unfortunately, you did not see it. Well, yes! Let us see what the religious folks might be up to.
SEA:
Okay, so Darcy, you are in Commune… so you go into a meditative state.
MARIS:
Yes.
SEA:
And that basically means that you are able to refresh, right?
MARIS:
And prepare all my Rotes.
SEA:
And Ananka, you get to roll The Sight at the end of the three hours. Even with the strange murmur in the background of some weird Candy game, you were able to stay focused enough and you roll 2d6 plus your Wisdom bonus.
MAGGI:
Okay. 7.
SEA:
Plus…
MAGGI:
+2, so 9.
SEA:
So on a 9, if you want to read what it says on a 7 to 9.
MAGGI:
“On a 7 to 9 you get an unrelated vision.”
Laughter.
CARTE:
Well, thank goodness we stopped for three hours so that could happen.
SEA:
So, what I will say, Ananka is that you’ve been sitting in your little lean-to, you’ve got everything out, you’ve been doing the ritual, spending extra care this time.
And for the last many times you’ve just felt when you get your Sight, something… Something’s just bugging you and you’re not sure what. And you get that same feeling this time. Just—it’s hard to put your finger on it. Whereas before, you always believed, right? You just… your whole life, you believed what you get.
So you see the Tree of the Oracle. The Tree of the Oracle Idries is a 200-foot, massive tree, like it is 30 to 40 to 50 feet wide at the base, and is 200 feet tall, and its branches go out and it’s usually green and vibrant.
And what you see is a tree that has next to no branches. It is as if it’s been struck by lightning, but it’s so large—what lightning could ever do that? But it is a burnt-up husk.
And that’s what you get.
And you hear Blat approaching the two of you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
How is our religiousing doing? Do we know anything that needs to occur?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m ready to go. I don’t know what Ananka is doing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello within the lean-to?
Coming into the lean-to. Hello!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Yes. I’m trying to understand why I am seeing what I am seeing.
MAGGI:
And Ananka’s a little bit weary… because she doesn’t want them to know that she’s faltering a little bit, and can’t quite see what she wants to see and she can’t trust herself. But she doesn’t want their confidence in her to waver.
SEA:
Yup.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Maybe if we just travel eastwards rather than west. We’ve been going a little bit too much west. We need to veer a little bit more and go to east and—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So… back the way we were going.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Yes, I think we just missed a little… um, there was fork in the road, and I think we took wrong fork. And, you know, I haven’t really been eating a lot, so… we have to go back just a little bit the other way. It’s just slight little problem.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Normally, I would be upset about this news. But again, I find it just so refreshing in this area that I don’t mind.
Now, if food is a problem, might I suggest partaking in some of the fairy cakes that Eggerton has. I don’t see how there could possibly be any negative side effects if you were to try one!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
That sounds like very good idea. Eggerton, do you have any more of your fairy cakes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shouts)
What?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(yelling)
Do you have any more of your fairy cakes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, yeah yeah.
MIK:
And I come trotting over to the lean-to and reach in.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
He lives for this. He’s very excited about this.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Now, let me look at your aura. Yeah ok. I think you’re kind of an orange person, so I’m going to pull out one of these special orange-icing ones. Here you go. And if you just take that… and I’d say eat half now, and maybe half in about an hour? But don’t eat all of it at once.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Thank you, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You’re welcome.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
This is very nice. I will eat half.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Go ahead. I’d like to see you eat it, though.
MAGGI:
So Ananka breaks it in half and eats half, places the other one somewhere beneath her cloak.
SEA:
It is powerful, what you eat. It’s a powerful fairy cake. Roll Fairy Cakes!
MIK:
Rolling Fairy Cakes.
That is a 10.
MARIS:
Wow.
SEA:
You are fully refreshed, vibrant, lots of energy. You feel better than you’ve felt in a long time, Ananka.
MAGGI:
Excellent.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Wow. Thank you so much for this fairy cake Eggerton, my fairy boy. This is very very good. Okay! I am 100 percent confident. We just have to veer this way—
SEA:
And suddenly you are filled with a cold dark chill, Ananka. Something is nearby.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(lowers her voice)
It is him.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh-oh… the fairy cake went bad.
This happens sometimes. Now, everyone just stay calm.
Now, listen to my voice. Everything’s going to be okay. You sit down, maybe think about a nice story from your childhood. Focus on that. We’ll keep everything nice and calm and quiet for you until this passes—it’s totally normal, it happens to some of us sometimes.
SEA:
It is so close. It is literally outside the flaps, what you feel.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I don’t think this is just the fairy cake. This is something very strong. I have not felt this in a very very long time. We have to keep moving. We must go on.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’ll go get Darcy.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No, wait!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No… I’ll… I’ll not go.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No, he’s—he is right outside.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who’s outside?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Oh no.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I believe that is just Darcy who would be outside.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(calls)
Darcy, are you outside?
SEA:
There’s no answer.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh-oh.
SEA:
You just hear the wind outside.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat, you should go check on the wind.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, I’ll go see… what the wind is doing.
CARTE:
Blat lifts up the flap of the lean-to, pokes his head out…
SEA:
So the sun is starting to go down. It’s quite beautiful, the desert, and you see a silhouette of Darcy, standing maybe six feet away. You can still see her pretty well. It’s light enough.
And she’s not moving.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… Darcy? I don’t mean to be rude, but based on the conversation that we just had, your behavior is freaking people out a little. So I’m just talking now as a means of gaining your attention.
SEA:
Her head slowly turns toward you… and you see that her eyes are completely black.
Crickets.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I see.
Just a moment; I’m going to be returning to you after I speak to the others inside the lean-to.
CARTE:
I close the flap… sit down, and in a calm measured voice…
Nervous laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
In the brief time that we’ve been inside, Darcy has been possessed by the Shattering.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The what? No, what? Wait.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now, it’s all right…
I don’t know why I said that. Nothing about this is all right.
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Now is officially the time to panic; I’m in charge. Everybody, stand up. And we’re going to start shaking a little bit.
(his voice begins to shake)
I’m going to cry. It’s okay though, because everything is not okay, and that’s what we do when things aren’t okay! We cry, because it lets out all of the sad…
(he breaks down)
Oh no…!
SEA:
The flap opens.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaa!
MAGGI:
Ananka shoots up and makes sure she’s in front of Eggerton and Blat, because she does love these guys. She doesn’t want anything bad to happen to them and especially because she’s the one that brought them along with her on this trip.
SEA:
You step in front and you see Darcy—well, Darcy’s face, but it looks strange. And there are black orbs where her eyes would be. And a voice comes out—
Darcy speaks in a low voice that echoes unnaturally.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There you all are.
Rapid-fire:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fairy cake. Give her a fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I got… I got a fairy cake!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Do something with the fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right.
MIK:
I throw a fairy cake at her.
SEA:
(laughs)
And Darcy, suddenly you are standing in the tent. And they’re all like, panicking and they’re all staring at you—Eggerton’s peeking out from behind Ananka, and he’s throwing a fairy cake at you.
MARIS:
So a fairy cake bounces off my forehead.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Got her!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton! What are you doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It worked! Fairy cakes work against the Shattering!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Fairy cakes are the greatest invention ever! You know, I don’t even know why we’re bothering with all of these medallions and beetles and stuff. We’ll just bake a big batch of fairy cakes—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
—we’ll go find the Shattering…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(chanting)
Fairy cake! Fairy cake! Fairy cake! Fairy—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What is going on? What am I… I don’t even remember coming in here! What are you doing in here? What? Why are you throwing fairy cakes at me?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because your eyes are black.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, no, Eggerton, my eyes are not black, thanks for noticing—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because I threw the fairy cake. And it worked!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me. Ananka, could you make any sense of this for me? Because I don’t understand what the fairy is saying.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
This is something I have not seen in a very long time, and I don’t understand how he’s able to find us this easily.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me. Blat, could you please tell me what’s going on?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You were possessed by the Shattering and now I’m debating whether or not we leave you in the desert to die.
Laughter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?! Are you saying that something possessed me?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just briefly, for just a moment. You seem all right now… but I don’t know if perhaps you’ve developed some sort of connection to the Shattering or not. How do you feel generally?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I feel fine. I don’t feel connected to any Shattering or… Are you sure? Are you sure it wasn’t just a trick of the light or something?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know if your opinion can be trusted.
(hisses, to the others)
What do we do with her?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait, I have a question. Can you say “There you all are”?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(puzzled)
…“There you all are.”
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, that wasn’t the light.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay… I don’t know what’s happening. Ananka, you said that you felt something? Or something’s going on?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I don’t understand why! I don’t understand how! He should not be able to find us this easily. This was not supposed to happen. I did not see this.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We hear this quite a bit. “Not supposed to”, “shouldn’t have”, “there’s no way this is going to”… But it always seems to occur! Now we’re getting picked off one at a time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, maybe we should get out of this place. Maybe we should head off. I don’t know—what direction, Ananka? Where should we go?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, let’s see… to the north it’s desert; to the south is desert; if we go east there’s desert; and if we head westward—oh, there’s desert! Where can we go?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
At least it won’t be here where this thing is stalking us!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Let us keep walking. I feel… East. Let us go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Towards the darkness it is.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(without enthusiasm)
Huzzah…
SEA:
So you pack up, and the four of you head off east, perhaps walking a little closer together this time?
MIK:
With Darcy in the middle.
CARTE:
So we can watch her.
SEA:
And it is starting to get dark.
CARTE:
Oh, good.
SEA:
It’s starting to get hard to see where the path is because it’s sort of like an old road through the desert. And after a while, because of the wind, you no longer see your footsteps. Now, I need to know the order. Who’s first? I know Darcy is in the middle-ish.
MAGGI:
I will be first again.
SEA:
Ananka is first.
MIK:
I’m going to be last. The most important position in the line.
SEA:
(laughs)
Okay.
CARTE:
And I’ll be behind Darcy.
MARIS:
No. No. I think Darcy is behind Blat, who’s behind Ananka, because I’m feeling a little unsure of myself, and I’m actually walking a little closer to the big half-demon that I would normally.
SEA:
How does Blat feel about having Darcy clinging to his back?
CARTE:
Every so often I’ll look behind myself just to make sure that her eyes are still their original colour.
SEA:
Okay. So it’s to get a little difficult. But it’s pretty, it’s a desert, it’s pretty flat. You hear you know the desert sounds are changing, the wind’s dying down a little. It’s starting to get pretty cold, pretty quick… and how long do you guys want to keep walking?
MAGGI:
Until we see green.
Laughter.
MARIS:
That’s a long time.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey, Ananka. I read stories about these creatures that used to chase fairies called Snufflesaurs. And I’m wondering if maybe Snufflesaurs are out in this desert? I wasn’t too clear on where they are, but I feel kind of exposed back here and I can hear things. And you know there was the black eyes and everything. So, is that something, you know, like I need to be looking for? should I carry a stick or a bell or some kind to frighten them off?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Don’t worry I brought my automated mortar and pestle, so any of those creatures try to attack you, I put them in here, I smash. I make big smash. They are made into food for me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
O… okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Second question, I’m getting pretty tired. Do you think we could stop and make camp here or somewhere close to here?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The last time we made camp you were possessed by the Shattering.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, if we don’t sleep soon I’m going to be possessed by something worse.
MAGGI:
So Ananka is concerned that morale is really weakening. So she wavers and decides to give in and set up camp—making sure they are all in the same tent.
SEA:
Okay. So you are setting up a one of the large tents that you brought. Everyone is going to be in the tent? Anybody have anything you need to do alone like in a horror movie? Anyone need to go outside in their underwear without a flashlight for any reason?
MARIS:
I am not going outside at all. And in fact, I put myself right in between Blat and Eggerton with my sleeping roll.
CARTE:
Blat does not require a sleeping roll. He merely wraps himself in his wings due to it being very cold in the desert at night.
SEA:
So he takes his shirt off for bed!
CARTE:
Yes he does. But turning his back to others so that no one can see.
MIK:
I take out my body pillow that I brought with me. It’s inflatable.
Laughter.
MIK:
And put on my sleeping hat. And I’ve got a little bowl with some stones in it that tumble over each other gently and sound like a river. And I set that to one side and I kind of snuggle up close to Darcy and I say,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Can we keep the lantern on for a little while?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s… That’s fine with me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEA:
Ananka, you’re…?
MAGGI:
Ananka sleeps sitting up.
Laughter.
MAGGI:
Because she can’t.
MIK:
That’s not creepy. Wake up in the middle of the night in the tent and the witch is sitting in the corner, cross-legged, staring.
CARTE:
Check her eyes! Check her eyes!
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay, so everyone roll 2d6 for me…
MARIS:
Oh God.
(laughs)
SEA:
And let me know who rolls the highest number.
MIK:
9.
MAGGI:
4.
CARTE:
9.
MARIS:
9!
MIK:
What! And they’re all 6 and 3 too!
MAGGI:
Fixed!
MIK:
That’s crazy.
The guitar music returns. Stabbing, suspenseful chords.
SEA:
Okay.
Blat, Darcy and Eggerton… your eyes all open. You don’t remember falling asleep, because you’re sort of snuggled and afraid.
Your eyes all open at the exact same moment, and you hear a shuffling and a moaning sound outside the tent.
A chorus of zombie groans.
MIK:
Oh geez.
MIDROLL: OUR SPONSO:

MIDROLL: COOKING EGGERTON STYL:
TV theme music.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s time for Cooking Eggerton Style with your host Mike Howie!
MIK:
All right, everybody! Thanks so much for joining me. So Carter here helped me put together some of these fairy cakes that are actually based on the ones that Eggerton would make in the show.
CARTE:
So these are real-life fairy cakes that you’ve made.
MIK:
Well, they’re about as close as we can get to real life fairy cakes. I mean, obviously fairy powder isn’t really a thing.
CARTE:
Sure. Of course.
MIK:
So I had to replace a few ingredients… but this is purple swirly. This is the one I probably talk about the most.
CARTE:
It’s very purple. It’s really colourful!
MIK:
Yeah. So I’ve I’ve set one aside here for you—why don’t you give it a shot and see what you think!
CARTE:
Okay. Well, I’d be really curious to know what you put in this to make it so bright, so colourful! Mm… It’s quite—
(he tries it and starts to gag violently)
MIK:
What… What’s?
CARTE:
This tastes like laundry detergent!
MIK:
What do you mean it tastes like…? Aw jeez. Okay. I was going to do this other show about laundry.. and I may have mixed up the props a bit. So that may actually be a detergent pod.
CARTE:
This is why it’s so colourful?!
MIK:
Well, no, the fairy cake is colourful because of the food dye. But I guess it kind of looks the same with the purple… and it’s kind of swirly and stuff. But if you actually look at the the real fairy cake, you’ll see it’s pretty cool: I used a little pen of dye to write hashtag-#OtherBothers, for the fans. I thought they would like that. Isn’t that a great idea, Carter?
CARTE:
(weakly)
I don’t feel so good…
MIK:
You’re fine. And we actually saw on a review on iTunes—it’s a great place for people to review—that they love the idea of fairy cakes, and how much it’s influenced the show. So thanks, everyone who does that!
CARTE:
I’d like to leave a poor review.
MIK:
Okay, well… here. I’ve got a glass of almond milk here. Why don’t you take that, just you know, wash it a little bit down.
CARTE:
All right.
MIK:
Get it out of your system.
CARTE:
This is not almond milk!
MIK:
Oh yeah. That’s the bleach from the laundry.
CARTE:
Ugh. Oh… Oh God…
MIK:
Oh shoot.
All right. Fortunately a lot of people have been really helpful in going to Patreon.com/AlbaSalix and supporting the show. And that means that we can probably afford the ambulance ride!
CARTE:
(heaves)
MIK:
Well, I think that’s all the time we have for the Eggerton Cooking Show today…
CARTE:
Call 9–1‑1!
Theme music plays.
BONE:
Zombie groans.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(in a low voice)
Eggerton… is that your water rock thing making that sound?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, the rocks make more of a tumble sound—that’s a shuffle sound. And I left my Shuffler at home.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(carefully)
Is the witch… in the lean-to?
SEA:
Ananka is there.
You wake up with a start as they’re talking, Ananka.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Why is everyone awake? I thought we were supposed to rest. I stopped because we had to rest.
CARTE:
Oh, we’re just terrified, that’s all.
MARIS:
Zombie. Zombie. Zombie.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I personally like my brains the way they are. And last time, they said they wanted brains and I wasn’t okay with that, so I think that someone should probably go ask the zombie to go away and play with a snufflesaur.
SEA:
Something bumps the outside of the tent.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay! So I’m going to go over to this side of the tent now, away from the bumping and I, um, Blat, Blat, Blat, Blat, I think you should probably, you know, go play bazooka with the zombie.
SEA:
I just want to point out, Eggerton is wearing a sleeping hat and clutching his body pillow.
Laughter.
MIK:
Mhm.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Because I have a soul bound bazooka I am the one that constantly has to deal with zombie attacks.
SEA:
There’s a ripping sound and you see something trying to claw its way through the side. Clearly not intelligent enough to try and come in the flap, just trying to rip through—and the moaning is quite loud now.
MARIS:
So, I just assume that this is a zombie or one of the undead. So I grasp the stone around my cord, and I hold it aloft and I call on Loxsyn for protection, which is one of my abilities.
SEA:
What does it say?
MARIS:
It says “Roll +Wisdom.”
That’s a 7… It’s a 9 with my +2. And it says, “On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you.”
MIK:
Ooh.
SEA:
Okay. So all of a sudden the ripping stops in the tent and you just hear them moaning and it’s moving around the tent.
MARIS:
And I’m just mumbling a prayer and holding my stone around my neck.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I need to get a stone like that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Now that that’s happened, I feel confident that I may then heroically step out of this tent and see what is occurring!
MAGGI:
Ananka does not let Blat step out of that tent, because she feels extremely responsible for the situation.
SEA:
Okay, so what do you do?
MAGGI:
So Ananka gets them to go to the back of the tent, and she exits the tent to see what is happening.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But… I have a soul bound w… all right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You go girl.
SEA:
Okay, so you push him back—you don’t let him… or you grab him, okay.
And you let her? You’re okay with that?
CARTE:
Yup.
Laughter.
CARTE:
You do you.
SEA:
And so Ananka, you open the flap and it is not yet dawn. So it’s a little hard to see, but you see there must be… There’s a lot. There’s a lot of shambling half-humanoid-like creatures shambling slowly around the tent. You see three or four just on this side, and they all turn towards you as you open the flap, and they start moving towards you.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
What the hell.
Okay, so you seem to have made it this far. You can follow us no matter where we go, it appears.
MAGGI:
Can Ananka reach for her weapon?
SEA:
She may!
Okay, so you see Ananka step outside the flap and you draw your weapon. And I’m very excited to learn what this weapon is, Ananka.
MAGGI:
The weapon is a staff… made out of the bones of her three former horsemen.
MARIS:
Oh my goodness.
MIK:
What?!
CARTE:
Dear Lord in heaven!
SEA:
So just as the flaps close, you see her pull something white and long from her back… and Ananka, there are four of them moving towards you as you step outside the flap—and you want to attack?
MAGGI:
I do. I would like to attack.
SEA:
Okay. So that’s Hack and Slash. Roll 2d6 +Strength, your Strength bonus.
Maggie rolls.
MIK:
Ooo, that’s a 14.
SEA:
You just rolled a natural 12?!
MAGGI:
+2!
SEA:
So 14.
SEA:
Okay so on a 10+… Normally, in battle, you take damage when you give damage. You can actually do full damage to one of them and not get hit at all from that one you’re attacking—there are four coming out so none of them will be out to hit you this round—or you can do an additional +d6 damage, but you’re going to take some damage.
MAGGI:
I will take some damage.
SEA:
Okay. So let’s first of all, you roll your d10 plus your bonus, which is 2. Your Strength bonus is 2, so that’s 4 and then roll d6 + 8…
So you guys hear… What does Ananka do when she attacks with her staff what do they hear? Do you scream something?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(roars)
Od śmierci pochodzi życie!
(Polish: From death comes life!)
SEA:
(laughing)
Awesome.
And you guys hear what sounds like bones exploding outside, as basically you cut through two of them and they explode into pieces. So two of them are down. And the problem is that there are two others that do attack you.
So can you roll… well I’ll just roll it. In Dungeon World, you’re supposed to roll, but I like to roll once in a while.
So you take 2 damage. So Ananka, you take 2 damage; however, your robe has an Armor of 2 and it absorbs 2 damage.
So basically, one of them latches onto you from behind and is like trying to bite you, but it’s just bouncing off your robe. You take no damage.
So that’s what you guys hear: you hear a war cry, and you hear these explosions of bone and you hear scrabbling from outside the hut.
MARIS:
So I start moving towards Blat and Eggerton at the back of the tent to try and reach out for their arms to bring them into my circle.
SEA:
And the second you let go of your amulet, you hear the moaning increase and zombies start to crash through the tent walls, ripping it apart.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Must keep praying. Must keep praying!
MARIS:
So then I my hands fly back to my throat clutching the stone and I start doubling my my praying and stop moving.
SEA:
Instantly you see the zombies that are now half in the tent all sort of stop, and sort of just be looking at the the three of you. They are all just standing there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
Loxsyn grant me strength. Loxsyn grant me strength. Loxsyn—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I really need to get one of those stones.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eggerton, make sure you stay close to Darcy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s time to use a long-range weapon at close range.
Bazooka!
The bazooka assembles itself out of thin air.
SEA:
And instantly you call your weapon to you, and a bazooka materializes on your shoulder… the tube coming out in front of you and a display popping up, and a little green light says ARMED AND LOADED.
CARTE:
Blat flips it around in the other direction, uses the end of the bazooka, smashing it in the face of a zombie in front of him.
SEA:
Roll Hack and Slash!
Carter rolls.
MARIS:
Oooh.
CARTE:
That’s a 10.
MARIS:
A natural 10.
SEA:
Plus Strength. Do you have a Strength bonus?
CARTE:
That is a negative. So that’s a 9.
SEA:
Okay. Blat you basically do damage. So let’s roll your damage die, which is a d8.
CARTE:
6.
SEA:
Okay. So you have to sort of step forward further than you expected, but you put your bazooka right through its head and it just drops to the ground lifeless—but you stumble forward away from Darcy. And another zombie tries to latch on to you and grabs your leg, and is gnawing on your leg—RAR GNAR GNAR—for 3 hit points of damage.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Need the witchy stick! Witchy stick over here to the back of the tent! Witchy stick!
MIK:
I jump up, suddenly remembering what I got from the quartermaster… and I reach into my fairy pouch to the very bottom, and pull out a handful of burned fairy cakes. And I take aim at the one chewing on Blat’s leg and throw it as hard as I can.
Laughter.
MARIS:
Look at Sean’s face.
MIK:
I broke Sean.
SEA:
…Where did these burned ones come from?
MIK:
The Quartermaster? We visited….
SEA:
Yeah?
MIK:
And he gave me a battleaxe I left behind because it was too heavy, and a bunch of burned cakes and I didn’t understand what they were for.
SEA:
Okay! So… thank you?
So you see Eggerton throw a blackened fairy cake, which bounces off the zombie on your leg.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Witchy stick! I asked for witchy stick! Soiled dessert items aren’t going to help in this situation!
(he screams)
SEA:
Outside, Ananka, all the zombies—like there’s a zombie on your back and it drops off and the other one that’s left—you had four there, and two are dead—they’re just ignoring you and moving towards the three that are inside the tent.
MAGGI:
So Ananka of course follows them into the tent.
SEA:
Okay.
MAGGI:
And, you know, she’s got her witching stick. So once again yells,
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Od śmierci pochodzi życie!
MAGGI:
…and stabs the hell out of them.
SEA:
So you see two zombies coming through the tent flap and then you see Ananka come through, shout this cry—and describe what they see you swinging?
MARIS:
This rod made of very well-tempered bones.
SEA:
And roll 2d6 for Hack and Slash plus your Strength bonus of 2.
MAGGI:
So 10.
SEA:
That’s a 10! What happens? Roll your damage. Let’s roll your damage and then I’ll have you tell me. But we have a choice. So that’s 1+2 is 3 damage. Do you want to roll the additional d6 and risk taking damage or…?
MAGGI:
I will roll the additional damage.
SEA:
7. Okay, so basically, there were two zombies coming and then Ananka appears, swings this crazy bone thing and one of them just explodes into dust. There’s still one zombie there. So there are—it’s hard, guys, there are all kinds of zombies coming through the tent and it’s dark—but there’s at least another three it’s maybe four. It’s hard to tell in all the action.
MARIS:
So Darcy sees that Eggerton got a burned fairy cake from out of his bag. I stop my praying, and I run over to Eggerton and I grab his bag. And I empty it out and ideally more fairy cakes drop out, more burned fairy cakes.
SEA:
Yep.
MARIS:
I grab all the fairy cakes in my hand and I have a I have a rote spell called Sanctify, which means that food or water I hold in my hands is consecrated by my deity.
So I cast that, Sanctify, on all these burned fairy cakes and I lob as many as I can in different directions to zombies, because these are now deified, consecrated fairy cakes.
SEA:
So… I’m going to say they are deified, sanctified fairy cake grenades.
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay, so roll… we’ll say you get two of them thrown off in different roles. Roll 2d6 to hit, first of all.
MARIS:
Oh, okay.
SEA:
I’ll give you a +1 because they’re grenades.
MARIS:
A 4.
SEA:
Do you have… for Volley, what’s your Dex?
MARIS:
Yes, I have a +1. So I’m at 5.
SEA:
Okay. So you miss, but you see Darcy holding up, pouring out your stuff, grabbing these cakes and then just throwing them, two of them in two random directions—and they literally hit the ground and explode, just shredding the tent. And the zombies are still there, but it’s a pretty loud explosion.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Good thing I didn’t eat those ones.
CARTE:
Blat once again that uses the end of the bazooka as a blunt weapon to try to get this one off his leg.
SEA:
Okay. Roll 2d6 Hack and Slash.
CARTE:
4.
MARIS:
Eugh.
SEA:
Okay so you’re just like slamming it down into it.
CARTE:
Slamming it down into it just hitting the remains of his clothing. Thinking that I’m hitting him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Get! Off! Of! My! Leg!
(breaks down sobbing)
SEA:
And he bites hard into your ankle. You hear something crunch and you take 3 hit points.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Nooooo! Witchy stiiick!
Laughter.
SEA:
All of the zombies now are moving in on you guys now that Darcy is throwing grenades. So there’s one latched to the leg of Blat, and you see there are three others now coming through the tent walls.
MIK:
I hear Blat cry. And screw up my courage and scream—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat!
MIK:
And jump on the back of the zombie that’s chewing on his leg.
SEA:
Okay!
MIK:
And try and hammer it with weak fists.
SEA:
You can totally do that. Roll Hack and Slash.
MIK:
Hack and Slash…
That is a 6.
SEA:
Oh, you have a ‑1 Strength?
MIK:
I do have a ‑1 Strength.
SEA:
Okay. So both you and Blat are pounding the clothing that this zombie is wearing and it has continued to gnaw on Blat’s leg. Okay. Anyone else want to… Ananka?
MIK:
(laughing)
I think Ananka needs to go now!
MAGGI:
Can I do Merciless? Is that a thing I can do?
SEA:
It is a thing you can do.
MARIS:
Ooh, I like that sound of that!
MAGGI:
The Advanced Move of Merciless.
SEA:
Read Merciless.
MAGGI:
So, “Merciless: When you do damage and you do +1d4 damage.”
SEA:
Yes, you could have been using that all this time.
Laughter.
SEA:
So I guess you’re gonna attack one of them with your staff.
MAGGI:
Okay.
SEA:
So tell us how you want to attack… Which zombie and how you want to attack them.
MAGGI:
I would… Well, I think Blat and Eggerton have got this one covered.
Laughter.
SEA:
We’re not so sure about that.
CARTE:
We really don’t.
SEA:
But yes, it’s a valid assumption.
MAGGI:
I really think you know, two against one, and I have faith in them because like I partly why I… I didn’t expect this to happen, but I expected something might come up. So I do believe they’re well-trained enough that they can handle the one zombie two-on-one.
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
Oh—you rolled a fail and you rolled a fail, you both get an experience point. Don’t forget. Okay.
MAGGI:
I’m sorry—how many are there in the tent?
SEA:
There are three in the tent that are converging in… Darcy is throwing some kind of sanctified grenade. There’s one latched on to Blat.
MAGGI:
All right. So I will address two of them.
SEA:
Okay. Go for it.
MAGGI:
So that’s a 6.
SEA:
Okay… so tell me what happens when you go—two of them are lined up right there like, it’s a perfect sweep… How do you miss? What happens?
The grinding bass note of the Shattering.
MAGGI:
I have another flash of just not knowing. That presence just suddenly invades my mind just for a split second and it just completely throws me off.
SEA:
I love it. You feel the Shattering enter your brain and say—
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
(reverberating, sinister)
Ananka.
SEA:
And then it’s broken but—you see Ananka stumble forward and zombie latches onto you, the third one latches onto you and starts gnawing on your shoulder for 4 damage. So one of them is now latched onto the back of Ananka.
MARIS:
Okay, so I see that my fairy cake bombs are not being very effective.
SEA:
They shredded—they exploded! They look really effective! They just missed.
MARIS:
They missed all the zombies. So I’ve now moved over beside Blat and the zombie gnawing on his foot and I again clutch my stone and I start praying again and I’m rolling to Turn Undead…
SEA:
+Wisdom.
MARIS:
…and it’s really bad.
(laughs)
It’s a 3. So we’re never getting this zombie off Blat’s leg.
SEA:
(laughing)
There’s now three of you…!
So Eggerton, you are riding a zombie. Blat, you’re trying to bash it with your bazooka—screaming, I assume at this point.
CARTE:
Absolutely.
SEA:
But you are very excited to see Darcy come over and grasp her amulet and start doing her thing, but it’s continuing to feed on your leg and it’s working its way up towards your juicy calf.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What is happening?! Bashy bashy!
He rolls.
MARIS:
Oh no.
CARTE:
4?!
SEA:
You got an experience point, Darcy, for the last one.
(to Carter)
You get another experience point.
CARTE:
I don’t want an experience point!
SEA:
Eggerton, do you want to try doing anything?
MIK:
Yeah. I scream and I bite it.
MARIS:
(laughs)
Oh God.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaa!
SEA:
Okay! I’m going to say that at this point it is so… you don’t have to roll, because it is not even trying to defend itself from you—it is just slowly eating Blat alive, so you can bite it.
Roll 1d4 or—no, roll your damage. What’s your damage?
MIK:
d10. No, I get a d6…
That’s a 6. Minus 1, so it’s a 5.
SEA:
Explain to me how Eggerton kills a zombie by biting it in the back.
MIK:
…It’s a good question.
Laughter.
MIK:
He—I just broke my pen. It’s all right.
SEA:
Use that.
MIK:
Use it.
He bites into the rotting flesh and gets this acrid taste and pulls away.
MARIS:
Ugh. Ugh!
MIK:
Little does he know that there’s already a blade buried next to the spinal column from when the zombie was first killed but didn’t quite hit. So by pulling away some flesh, he moves the blade that’s been wedged in there and severs the spinal column of the zombie.
Laughter.
SEA:
So Eggerton spits out some really gross-looking stuff, and the zombie is now a pile of bones at your feet, Blat. Now there are still…
MIK:
There’s still a horde of zombies outside the tent!
SEA:
There is still a zombie on your back, Ananka, and there are two that are now moving towards them, and there’s one on your back. What do you want to go for?
MAGGI:
Well, I throw off the one on my back, because I am strong. Despite taking all the hit points, Ananka is pretty strong.
SEA:
Okay. Roll it! Roll Hack and Slash. Let’s roll Strength. Defy Danger, Strength since you’re trying to throw it. Roll 2d6 plus your Strength.
Maggie rolls.
MARIS:
Oh no.
MAGGI:
So that’s a 4.
Laughter.
MARIS:
We lost our mojo.
SEA:
You get Experience. Okay… so Ananka basically falls backwards out the tent flap, and you just hear a clattering and commotion outside. And in the tent there are two zombies now coming for the three of you.
CARTE:
Blat, horrified at what he has just seen, spins the bazooka around facing the proper way, screams at Eggerton—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bloody gut mouth! Take the others in the opposite direction as fast as you can!
CARTE:
And Blat flies upwards.
SEA:
Into the roof of the tent.
CARTE:
Into the roof of the tent, trying to pull the tent upwards.
SEA:
All right, let’s roll Defy… Basically that could be… I guess it’s going to be Strength. It can be Dex or Strength.
CARTE:
It’ll be Dex.
Laughter.
CARTE:
5+1 is 6.
SEA:
You get an experience point.
So tell us what happens to Blat as he tries to fly through up the roof of the tent.
CARTE:
Have you ever seen a bird at the airport? Just… trying to get out and can’t.
So Blat keeps flying upwards at the very top of the tent, and every so often it goes about two inches off the ground… but nothing is really happening of any import, despite all the flapping.
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay. I’m going to say the tent comes down. So you’re all now covered in a falling tent. You hear zombies trying to crawl through it towards you. There’s a giant flapping demon trying to get his wings free.
MIK:
I send out the call—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Run away!
MARIS:
So I start crawling as fast as I can, with a tent on me… just to get out of the mess.
SEA:
Roll 2d6 +Strength. Or Dex.
MARIS:
It’ll be Dex.
It’s a 2!
I get an experience point.
SEA:
You get an experience point. Okay, so Darcy is trapped under the tent. Anyone else? Yes, go ahead Ananka, what do you want to do?
MAGGI:
Can Ananka try Heirloom?
SEA:
Try what?
MAGGI:
Can I try Heirloom?
MIK:
Is that a tomato?
MAGGI:
Can I “consult the spirits that reside within my signature weapon”?
SEA:
You may.
MAGGI:
I’m going to try to use Heirloom, because this is getting out of control.
SEA:
Okay, read that?
MAGGI:
“When you consult the spirits that reside within your signature weapon, they will give you an insight relating to the current situation and might ask you some questions in return.”
SEA:
Is there any kind of roll?
MAGGI:
“Roll +CHA”?
MIK:
Charisma.
MAGGI:
Okay. “On a 10+, the GM will give you good detail. On a 7 to 9, the GM will give you an impression.”
SEA:
Okay, roll 2d6 plus your Charisma bonus.
MAGGI:
So it’s 9.
SEA:
So the three spirits of your horsemen awaken. And everybody—even those who are under the flaps of the collapsing tent screaming “Run away!” or whatever—see this bright light flooding through the fabric of the tent… and…
Let me see that sheet.
Laughter.
SEA:
That is such a weird ability! That’s so cool.
MIK:
Wouldn’t the spirits be kind of pissed off at you?
MAGGI:
No, they’re happy to help.
MIK:
“Yes, yes, we will help you even though you beheaded us and turned us into a staff.” I wouldn’t trust that advice.
Laughter.
SEA:
You instantly know that you have to defeat them all—or you have to try and take on the Shattering directly.
CARTE:
Thanks, staff spirits!
MARIS:
I’m glad she took your bones and made them into a staff.
SEA:
Okay. So is anybody trying to do anything else?
MIK:
I’m trying to get out of the tent.
SEA:
And there’s an zombie, by the way that—you don’t take any damage, but he’s trying to bite through your robe still, on your back. You’re on top of him, you fell back on him. But there’s still a zombie trying to eat you through your robe.
MIK:
These zombies are rude. I’m going to try and run away from the tent as it’s collapsing.
SEA:
Okay, so let’s roll 2d6. That could be Dex…
MIK:
12!
MARIS:
Yay!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m free!
SEA:
Eggerton escapes into the beautifully cold, refreshing nighttime desert air. And you see a tent with all these forms struggling around in it and you see Ananka on her back with a zombie under her on the other side of the tent.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Get out! Come towards my voice!
MARIS:
How many zombies are left?
SEA:
You’re not sure. There’s definitely some zombies crawling around inside the tent, and there’s one outside the tent, you think, with Ananka, but you’re not sure what’s going on outside the tent. You’re sort of trapped, buried inside the tent.
MAGGI:
So Ananka pushes him off and—
SEA:
He’s under you. You are on top of him.
MAGGI:
I’m on top of him. Of course I am. Okay, so… Ananka just starts pummeling him.
SEA:
Love it.
MAGGI:
With her fists. Just pummeling him with her fists!
SEA:
Roll 2d6.
MAGGI:
So 9+2 is 11.
Wow.
SEA:
Wow. So what happens? How do you… literally this thing is dust, but what—you just roll over and start…?
MAGGI:
Just, you know… until there’s no face seen. The face is obliterated—just nothing but the innards of the face left.
Groans of horror from around the table.
SEA:
You guys hear. Some crunching and gritted-teeth mumbling from outside. Those of you out of the tent—Eggerton, you see Ananka just decimate what’s left of this one zombie.
MIK:
I turn and throw up.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
Urgh!
MARIS:
You, who just ate acrid zombie flesh, turn and throw up.
MIK:
That was in the moment!
SEA:
Blat, what are we doing, trapped under…?
CARTE:
Just trying to fly up.
Laughter.
SEA:
Roll 2d6 +Strength.
Carter rolls.
MARIS:
Ooo, 9! We got our mojo back!
CARTE:
8.
SEA:
Okay, so the tent starts to fly up. You’re suddenly freed, Darcy, and you see the two zombies sort of blinking and starting to—UGHHH—move toward you. It’s now like flapping up, crashing down to the ground. Flying up, crashing into a cactus going the other way… you hear screaming…
In the background, Blat flaps madly back and forth across the landscape, screaming as he runs into things.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve lifted us upward and now I shall use my bazooka to—aaagh!
SEA:
And the tent is receding into the distance.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I can’t quite see the—auugh!
MIK:
Are there any zombies left in the tent?
SEA:
You take 1 hit point.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Augh! That was sharp!
SEA:
No, everything’s uncovered. Darcy and the two zombies are now laying there—
MIK:
It’s pretty much Blat, with a tarp over him, flying off into the distance.
SEA:
Yes.
MIK:
Awesome.
SEA:
Sort of half crashing, half flying.
MARIS:
So I, freed from my bonds, leap up, and I start running towards the disappearing tent and I’m just yelling—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Bazooka! Bazooka! Bazookaaa!
The crickets fade out.
SEA:
We cut to morning.
And the four adventurers are a little bedraggled… sitting around an unlit fire with no tent as the sun rises. And there are signs of battle, and decrepit bones all around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Next time, can we stay at a hotel?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(wearily)
I… I don’t know how that could have gone worse. She was possessed. You… I don’t even want to remember what you did. And Witchy Bone Stick Lady is starting to freak me out. And I say this as a half-demonic being.
I don’t feel that this adventuring thing is something that we should be continuing to do. I’m a file clerk from a future time. And I did not even have the wherewithal to choose a weapon that I could use at close quarters.
I apologize for your tent.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I lost my pillow.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t apologize for that.
SEA:
Is Eggerton still wearing the sleeping hat?
MIK:
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ananka, I don’t feel like this is a successful field trip. I feel like something went terribly, terribly wrong. And right now, I blame you.
MAGGI:
Well… I blame Moira for signing the permission slips.
Laughter.
A string quartet begins a Eastern European-flavoured melody in a stiff, marching rhythm.
SEA:
You hear a creaking sound—like the sound that a hut would make if it was walking on four chicken legs, coming from over the next dune.
MIK:
That’s a weirdly specific description…
MAGGI:
(makes squeaking and creaking sounds)
MARIS:
I’ve never met a hut on four legs.
SEA:
You have now! You see a hut come over the dune, walking sort of awkwardly on four chicken legs, heading right towards you all.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
MAGGI:
(laughs)
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No Blat, no! It’s my hut!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Long distance is what I’m good at!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I’m pretty sure Greg might be in there!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Long distance!
Laughter.

Blat, could you please tell me what’s going on?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You were possessed by the Shattering and now I’m debating whether or not we leave you in the desert to die.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?!
SEA:
Your eyes all open at the exact same moment, and you hear a shuffling and a moaning sound.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Now is officially the time to panic—I’m in charge!
SEA:
Another zombie tries to latch on to you and grabs your leg—RAR GNAR GNAR…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Witchy stick, over here to the back of the tent! Witchy stick!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Od śmierci pochodzi życie!
SEA:
You cut through two of them and they explode into pieces.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaa!
SEA:
Explain to me how Eggerton kills a zombie by biting it in the back.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve lifted us upward and now I shall use my bazooka to—aaagh!
SEA:
You hear a creaking sound. You see a hut come over the dune, walking sort of awkwardly on four chicken legs, heading right towards you all.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No, Blat, no!
THE CHICKEN HU:
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Blat, for the last time, this is not a threat. Do not bazooka my chicken hut!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I have a kill shot! I have a long distance kill shot! It’s a freaky house with the chicken legs and we’re not going to be taken by surprise again, I got the kill shot! Give the word, I give the kill shot!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No kill shot, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fine. If this is your hut, why does it follow you about?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Because it’s my hut?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh well, that’s a wonderful explanation! That makes perfect sense. And now I’m totally at ease. Does someone else find the chicken walking hut at all disturbing?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There. Ha. You see?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think it has very pretty legs.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I saw what you did to that zombie and now your opinion doesn’t hold water with me.
SEA:
The hut comes to a stop, the chicken legs all flexing, bending and then lowering it down, so it’s just a foot or so off the ground… and the front door opens.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s how it eats you, you know. It just says hello, I’m a hut, please come in, and then the kitchen eats you, or something. I don’t know how it works.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Do not be afraid, everyone. This is a place of safety for those who I deem it so. You are all my friends. You may all come in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aww, she called us friends.
MIK:
And I trot along behind her.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy roleplaying game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your Game Master is Sean Howard, with players Marisa King, Carter Siddall, and Michael Howie, and special guest Maggie Makar.
Episode 9: Journey to the Temple, Part 2.
CHICKEN RU:
Soft wind chimes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m keeping myself locked and loaded because I don’t trust architecture that walks about.
SEA:
Do you want to describe what the entry room is?
MAGGI:
Sure. Basically it is just one room. There’s a sort of bed off to the left hand side with some hay on top of it, as well as a blanket. There’s a bit of a lofty area upstairs as well, just for whenever she needs to relax and work with her spells. And then to the front is just a giant window. And then on the right hand side, we have just a very basic kitchen setup for, you know, cooking.
SEA:
So as you step in, Blat, the last person, the door slams shut and the hut starts to herk and jerk forward in a completely different direction than you were all traveling.
And Ananka, this is unusual for the hut to be so animated. It’s often of its own mind, but it clearly is doing something here.
The Eastern European-influenced melody returns, this time on mandolin.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are we moving?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
That is a good question.
Kura? Why are you moving on your own? This is not what we agreed on when I first met you millions of years ago. You are mine. You are not supposed to be moving on your own.
SEAN (AS KURA, THE CHICKEN HUT)
BAWWCK!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(sighs)
Kura. Where are you taking us?
SEAN (AS KURA, THE CHICKEN HUT)
BUCK! B’GOCK!
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I think that is chicken for “to the Oracle”.
SEAN (AS KURA, THE CHICKEN HUT)
Ba-guck.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What’s the oracle?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why is it a chicken?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Why am I still allowing myself to remain here?
MIK:
(laughs)
MAGGI:
Because Ananka is not trusting her vision as much, she trusts that and knows somewhere in her heart that her hut is taking her where they’re supposed to go. Because this is basically like a companion to her and goes with her wherever she goes… so trusts that it’s taken into the right place.
Little by little, the music begins to speed up.
SEA:
The hut is clearly perturbed about something and moving at a pretty brisk pace. So the hut starts to run and it’s a very jerking kind of run. It’s hard to stay standing in the hut when its four chicken legs are all running out of sync with each other.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Does this chicken house that is running have seatbelts, Ananka?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
There are no seatbelts, but you can feel free to roam around as you wish, and trust that you will be safe.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t feel very safe, because it’s kind of jumping back and forth and the floor is uneven and there’s, you know, hard edges on things that I feel like I’m going to fall on…
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Maybe grab some hay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thanks.
MIK:
I grab some hay from the bed and hold it, looking around.
Laughter.
MARIS:
Darcy’s just pressed herself against the wall as tightly as she can.
CARTE:
Blat’s shifting back and forth from wall to wall just muttering to himself,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Don’t trust the house. I don’t trust the house. I don’t like the house, don’t trust the house.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
If there’s one thing you can trust today it is my house. It is Kura. She will take us to where we need to go. Despite her current demeanor and temperament.
SEAN (AS KURA, THE CHICKEN HUT)
BUCK!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Question. If this house knew where to go, why did we get lost before in the desert when we were attacked by all the zombies? Where was the house then?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
The house, it was… I believe it was perhaps helping another possible recruit. So it had to get them to the safe place. And now it is here to help us.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s great. We’re the second-tier recruits. That’s comforting.
Blat, you can put the bazooka away now. We can’t use it in close quarters anyway. Just put it away.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I would hope that you of all people would realize that the talking angry chicken house is not a normal situation. I will keep myself locked and loaded, thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Listen. We already left behind a crater where you destroyed the last of those zombies. Let’s not make a new one here. Let’s just try and relax. Ananka trusts the house. Let’s trust the house.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Perhaps I don’t trust Ananka. Has she given a single vision summary yet that was correct?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Not that I’m aware of.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Great. So now we’re in a giant chicken house. I should feel so much safer about where we are now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
The music is now at double its original tempo and still accelerating.
SEA:
And the hut has reached escape chicken velocity. So if you’ve ever seen a chicken run at full speed where it sort of flaps its wings and almost flies, then comes out to the ground… It sort of leaps off the next dune and you hear the flapping of wings, even though there are no wings, and then it hits the sand hard you all go stumbling. Then it’s running up the next dune and it reaches the top and it squawks and leaps off the next dune… And continues to do that at a high speed.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ananka. I’m feeling really sick. I’m feeling chicken house sick. Can you do anything about this?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
You just have to enjoy the ride!
Laughter.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Oh Kura, this is just like old times!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(groans)
SEAN (AS KURA, THE CHICKEN HUT)
BAGUCK!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And Darcy falls to the floor and just lays there gripping the floorboards.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I lean down and give Darcy some of the hay I picked from the bed.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How is this supposed to help me?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How is it supposed to hurt?
MARIS:
(laughs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay then.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You’re welcome.
SEA:
And suddenly, on a dime, the chicken house stops.
By now, the music has reached a ridiculous speed as well, and thrashes to a halt. Everyone gives a shout of alarm except for Ananka, who laughs heartily.
SEA:
And the kettle boils and the door opens.
MARIS:
There was a kettle boiling? That’s impressive.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Out of the chicken house! Getting out of the chicken house now!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I will also exit the chicken house.
MAGGI:
And Ananka has also only now realized that Greg is not in the chicken house. She does not express this out loud, but is wondering what has happened to Greg. Because the last time she left him she was pretty sure he was in the chicken house. He was in the hut.
SEA:
You watch the house as it nudges against Ananka, like a bit of a rub, and then a little harder, pushing her in a certain direction.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
This is the way we must go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right, let’s go in the direction of the chicken house.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry. I thought the chicken house wanted her to pet it or something…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, that may be. Maybe it wants both. But let’s just go in this direction. What is this Oracle you mentioned, Ananka? Why are we here?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
So this is Oracle Idries. She is a very old friend of mine. I believe that she will quantify my visions and she will confirm the things I’ve been seeing. At the very least, she will set Moira’s mind at ease.
SEA:
So you’re standing on a cart path and it is green. There is no desert. And you see a sparse forest around you and the cart path leads in two directions: one towards the chicken hut, which is now menacingly shoving Ananka forward again, and the other way away from the chicken hut.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I walk up and start petting the chicken house.
SEA:
It actually coos a little.
(coos)
Like a dove.
(laughs)
Laughter.
MARIS:
Sean cannot do chicken noises.
MIK:
He forgot what a chicken sounds like. There are also female chickens, if you were wondering.
SEA:
Thanks. Good to know.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See, everybody? It’s a nice chicken house. It likes to be pet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m fine with the chicken house. Let’s just follow the chicken house to this oracle. Is that where we’re going, Ananka?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Indeed, that is where we going.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey Blat! Come pet the house.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I… Quit saying chicken house like this is a regular turn of events! I’m not petting the weird freaky house!
SEAN (AS KURA, THE CHICKEN HUT)
BAAAWK!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay! It won’t bite you.
Well, it might bite you. I don’t know anything about it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Exactly! Which is why I’m not going to pet it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But I’m petting it and it’s not biting me.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s making weird dove noises. It doesn’t even know what type of bird it is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Fine. Let’s go then.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Can you put the bazooka way before it goes off and hurts someone?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I did not have the bazooka out yesterday. What happened? Massive zombie attack! The chicken house showed up, we’re all like, “Ooh, it’s just the chicken house, it should be fine, put your bazooka away.” Well, I’m sorry! I’m keeping myself locked and loaded and ready for action.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine. I’m walking behind you then.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(under his breath)
Walking behind me… you should walk behind me and get possessed by some demonic force. You can go ahead and walk behind me, I don’t care.
SEA:
Okay, so I assume all of you are—are you also going, Eggerton or are you going to stay and pet the chicken house?
MIK:
Yeah, no, I’m following. I am following.
SEA:
Okay. So you are following the cart path forward. Ananka! This feels familiar, like the last time you went to the Oracle.
MAGGI:
Suddenly Ananka definitely feels clearer. There’s a bit more certainty now in her walk.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
This way, everyone! We are moments away from meeting my old friend.
SEA:
Three hours later…
Laughter.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
So like I said, sometimes in my head time is that a jumbled. So three minutes becomes three hours. It’s no big deal.
We made it!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(weakly)
Yaaaay.
Crickets.
SEA:
Three hours later…
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
So if you double the three it becomes a six, and so you know, things scramble. So this is definitely… We are we are here. We are definitely here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you sure? I don’t see any Oracle.
SEA:
Around the bend, you do see a weathered two-story half-barn, half-road weary inn. It sits in a clearing beside the now quite overgrown path. It doesn’t look like too many wagons or carts have traveled this path in some time. There’s a sign half sort of falling off its hook, so it’s hooked by only one hook and it reads: “The Final Inn”.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Normally I would be terrified to approach such a foreboding bar tavern inn. But it doesn’t have animal legs, so I say we take a pit stop here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What does it mean by “Final”?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It only means this is the last place where you can enjoy a half-decent drink or a meal before we’re eventually murderized.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that sounds nice.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No, no, no, no. It’s the last place you look. What you are looking for is always the last place you look.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So, do you think they have, like, drinks and food?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
You know what? This is something I can clearly see!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well! The Oracle has spoken. The great witchy powers have finally come to the surface. I believe the tavern serves food.
SEA:
Okay! So who goes into the tavern?
MAGGI:
Ananka leads the way because she’s very familiar with this path. She knows what she’s doing.
SEA:
Okay. So Ananka, you open the door of this tavern and it really squeaks. Like, you have to put your shoulder into the door to open it. And inside is a pretty decrepit inn. Nothing like you remember. Except the bar is sort of in the same place, but there’s a lot of stacked dishes and some broken tables and clearly hasn’t been used in some time.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
This is very strange, not how I remember it. Little bit worse for wear. Could use makeover.
MAGGI:
So she approaches the bar because it’s the one thing that looks familiar and similar to what she remembers it looking like.
SEA:
You all enter this inn that has chairs stacked on tables. Looks like they’ve been stacked there for some time. A lot of dust, broken furniture, some old dishes and things stacked on the bar. And Ananka is walking up to the bar.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello? Anybody here in this creepy deserted bar?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think there’s any food.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve got my fairy cakes if we need them.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You mean the witch was wrong?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs heavily)
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
Huh? What’s that? Hello? What?
SEA:
You hear someone coming down the stairs.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s already out.
The bazooka materializes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve got two now.
Laughter.
CARTE:
One on each shoulder, just in case.
SEA:
Okay, so Blat has two bazookas. That’s canon now. Okay!
MIK:
He looks so proud of himself. “I broke the game again!”
SEA:
You hear a voice from up the stairs.
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
Um… Is it safe to come down?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
Blat. Put the bazookas away. This might be the Oracle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s safe if you’re safe. Are you safe? Do you just run a bar and that’s it? Nothing else?
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
Bar? What?
SEA:
And this old man starts coming down the stairs. He stops at the bottom of the stairs and pulls out his old glasses and puts them on.
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
Hah? Visitors? Visitors? Oh. Visitors. Most peculiar.
SEA:
He starts coming forward to go behind the bar.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So you do know you live-slash-work at a bar, correct?
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
(chuckles)
Not in some time, young man, not in some time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ananka? Is this the Oracle?
MAGGI:
Ananka takes a close look, just in case the Oracle has somehow shapeshifted in that few years since she’s seen the Oracle.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No, this is definitely not the Oracle.
Excuse me, sir. Where are we? Where is Idries?
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
Idries. The Oracle Idries?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
The one and only.
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
No one has come asking for the Oracle in many years.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Well, we are here today, my friend, and I hope you can help us. We have come a very long way.
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
Hm. All right, well, let me see if I can find some water, some glasses…
SEA:
And he’s picking up empty tankards and sort of dashing out what’s in them, and trying to fill it from an old water barrel.
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
Okay, I’ll get you some water from the road.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Thank you. Much appreciated.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you have any Impescor fizzy water?
SEA:
He doesn’t even answer.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’ll just have regular water. Thank you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Again, Eggerton, Impescor is a brand that will not exist for several more centuries. You don’t need to continue asking people in this timeline if…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You never know. Maybe the Emperor also came back in time and set up his lovely Impescor brand that we all have come to appreciate so much.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right.
MARIS:
Darcy sidles over to the bar, and plonks her sleeping roll and her other equipment on the top.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Listen, old man. We’re really tired. We’ve been walking for three hours—no, wait! It was six hours, wasn’t it. Six hours! We’ve been in a battle with zombies. We’ve been in the desert. We’re thirsty, we’re hungry. We don’t know where we are because apparently Ananka doesn’t know where we are. What’s going on? Who are you and what is this place?
SEAN (AS AN OLD MAN)
The name is Joe.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh. Hi Joe, I’m Darcy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m Eggerton.
SEAN (AS JOE, THE OLD MAN)
Good to meet you.
SEA:
He puts a dirty tankard in front of you with water in it, Darcy, and he starts filling up a second one.
SEAN (AS JOE)
I’d make you food but there’s not much. I wasn’t expecting visitors.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
For some time it seems. If you don’t run this bar any more, how do you make a living? Do you know of anyone who lives in this area?
SEAN (AS JOE)
No. Not much happens since the Oracle stopped speaking. There haven’t been visitors in many years. You’re the in first some time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
A moment please.
MARIS:
And Darcy turns and looks at Ananka.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The Oracle stopped speaking? Shouldn’t you have known about this?
MAGGI:
So she turns to Joe and says,
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
What do you mean the Oracle has stopped speaking? This is the first I’ve heard of this.
SEAN (AS JOE)
It’s been many many years now. But again, we don’t have many travelers, so maybe news travels slowly. People stopped coming to see the Oracle… I think it was five, no, maybe it was ten or more festivals ago.
SEA:
He puts another dirty tankard out in front of you, Ananka, with some water, and starts trying to clean and find a third one.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Well, I know she will speak to me. Where is she?
SEAN (AS JOE)
She’s still at the tree but the tree is… it looks dead. It’s just barely a stump now.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I was hoping that was wrong. I was hoping when I saw that it was just a scrambled version of reality.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Saw it with my own eyes. Sort of sad. Hard to get too close with all pieces that have fallen off.
SEA:
He starts filling up another tankard.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What pieces fell off and why are they hard to get past?
SEAN (AS JOE)
Is this your first time to see the Oracle?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It is my first time to see the Oracle! Where I come from we don’t really have oracles and, well, it’s been a long time. It is a really long time—there were zombies and the house with chicken legs and Blat had his bazooka and then he had another bazooka and it went on really long and he was saying there’s no Impescor—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It is his first time.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Huh. That’s pretty apparent.
SEA:
He puts a dirty mug in front of you with some water.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, thank you very much sir.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I’m sorry, I can’t watch this. I worked in food services. Listen, give me those.
MARIS:
And I grab all the tankards and I dump the water back down the barrel that’s beside him and I start taking old rags that I find and washing out the tankards and I’m refilling it and I just push the old man out of the way.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is really unsanitary. You can’t run a place like this. You need proper food, you need proper water. We’ve been going for a long time. Just let me deal with this and you tell us what happened to the Oracle.
MARIS:
And Darcy, quite professionally I might add, starts pouring in water, handing out tankards, wiping down the bar.
SEAN (AS JOE)
That’s quite impressive.
SEA:
He takes a seat on the other side of the bar.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Sorry, since the wife passed, you know, I never really did all this that much, I just—oh thank you.
SEA:
He takes a mug.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Could you put some of the ale in it from the second barrel?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, absolutely.
MARIS:
And Darcy expertly juggles the two tankards and then takes this from the barrel he pointed to, and slides it down the bar, and then slides three more down the bar to Eggerton and Blat and Ananka.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Be sure to charge them a silver each.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’ll be a silver each.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I got this covered.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excellent.
SEAN (AS JOE)
The name is Joe Moodless and it’s… again, you’re the first visitors—I didn’t really expect any visitors. I just sort of live upstairs now. I don’t really come down here much. The raccoons have sort of taken over this part.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…and I’m not sitting here any longer.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I like raccoons.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, there’s one now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, hello, raccoon.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He’s gone.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ll go find him.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No—
MIK:
I wander off after the raccoon.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
Oh no.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Well, you’re close. You know, the tree is only a few hours north through the path. There’s no sign any more, but you’ll see the path outside. But it’s not much of a tree anymore.
MAGGI:
And Ananka can’t wait any longer to figure out why the Oracle isn’t speaking, and would really like to move along in this point in their journey and tries to get Eggerton to come back from his raccoon hunt.
SEA:
How? Eggerton has now run into the kitchen after a raccoon.
MAGGI:
(laughs)
Ananka calls one of her soul companions, which are random hands that come out of the sky. And it corrals our dear friend Eggerton and brings him back to the bar.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What… what? There’s a hand!
SEA:
So you all see Eggerton come floating into the room, a giant hand holding him by the lapels, and depositing him back in the room with you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I have questions to ask, everybody. First, did anyone else see the hand? Second… why was there a giant hand? And why did it grab me like that? Third, really, did everyone else see it? Because I think that I may have had fairy cakes and forgot about it? That happens sometimes, I’m a nervous eater—so if someone could please explain what the hand was, I would appreciate that. Raccoon, my little friend, he left me to the hand; he did not want to get involved and now I’m out here. It’s a little disconcerting…
SEAN (AS JOE)
Is he going to go on for a long time?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
He tends to. He tends to.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
He’ll punch himself out in a moment.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(losing steam)
I… I just wish I could… oh no. Oh no. I’m going to sit down here.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Eggerton, these are my soul companions. Sometimes, when I need them, they will come from the sky and do what I need them to do. Right now I needed you to get the hell away from that raccoon so we can go talk to the Oracle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You could have just asked.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Okay. Next time.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEA:
The old man’s just sitting there looking at all four of you.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Joe… The path is still the same?
SEAN (AS JOE)
Yup. Path is still the same.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Have you noticed any unusual activity around here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Like zombies?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, or other evil presences? People with black eyes, perhaps. Have you noticed that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mostly zombies.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Just the Slaad.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry? The wha?
SEAN (AS JOE)
The Slaad.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What is, per se, the Slaad?
SEAN (AS JOE)
They wear these robes, they sort of—I don’t know, look like frog sort of people? But they walk around. They call themselves the Slaad.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are they friendly?
SEAN (AS JOE)
They don’t seem to be bothering anyone that I’ve seen.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I always like to make new friends. We should go see them.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, yes. Let’s see the frog person cult! No! What we’re going to do is spend the night here in the creepy Final Inn, and then in the morning head off to the dead tree where the Oracle won’t tell us anything.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That sounds like a good plan.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Fine.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It sounds like a terrible plan! But it’s the best plan we have.
SEAN (AS JOE)
I’d make your rooms but, well you know. There’s no locks on the doors. Just find a room that’s not too dirty.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know if that’s possible, but thank you very much.
SEAN (AS JOE)
The room with the red door, that’s mine. Any other room’s fine.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
So we’re sleeping first.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think that’s a good idea. Just in case we have any other problems.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Demonic problems. Or zombie problems that could have perhaps been solved by giant hands that appear out of nowhere—yes! Let’s get ourselves a room apiece.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Don’t make me call them to slap you.
Let’s get some rest.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So Darcy drains the tankard in front of her. And then I pick up my sleep roll and my other equipment and I march up the stairs.
SEA:
He holds out his hand for the silvers.
MARIS:
Do we have any silver on us?
MAGGI:
Well, Ananka’s got it covered. So Ananka pays Joe.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thanks, Ananka!
SEA:
So you go upstairs…
MARIS:
I go upstairs and I choose a room. And despite my razzing of his bazooka-toting I sort of feel comforted by having the half-demon with the bazookas in the room next to me so I shout down,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! Blat, you should you should take this room next to me. Uh. Yeah. This one here with the green door. I think that would be a good room for you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, very good. I’ll sleep there…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe keep your door open just in case you have a nightmare, and you need someone to come in and comfort you, you know, something like that. Okay, g’night!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ll take the first watch!
Laughter.
MIK:
And I sit down…
MARIS:
I feel so comforted.
SEA:
Where are you sitting?
MIK:
I sit down along the wall between their two doors.
SEA:
Okay. In the hall.
MIK:
Yeah. In the hall. And promptly fall asleep.
Laughter.
MIDROLL: PODCAST SHOUT-OUT—THE INFINITE BA:
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey everyone. Sean here with a quick message before we get to the funny part.
This week, we want to point you to another of our favourite live-play podcasts: The Infinite Bad. From the people who brought us MarsCorp and The Bunker, we join a group of everyday misfits caught in a nefarious web of evil beyond their reckoning. While this is definitely a horror live-play, the first two seasons were so laugh out loud funny that I listed it in my list of 2017 best comedies of the year. It’s a must listen.
Search for The Infinite Bad anywhere you listen to podcasts, or visit definitelyhuman.co.uk.
MIDROLL: A 26-STEP SYSTE:
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, Blat…!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, Snegal.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
There you are, Your Evilship! I didn’t see you hiding behind the door of your office.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I didn’t think we were in this episode together today.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh. Oh! I was told to report to you for training, sir!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh yes. So. I’m going to teach you the most important thing that I learned from my era.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(gasps)
Yeah? Oh… Wait! Wait! Snegal going to go get paper. Be right back!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
There was paper in here.
Silence.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! (laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m still in here. It’s the same room.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You’re still hiding behind the door. Yeah. Okay!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So the most important thing—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I need a pencil. Be right back!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay.
I was holding a pencil.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay, Blat! I’m ready!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay! The most important thing that a young man must know to work in my era.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that… is the alphabetization of files.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Ohhhh!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s a 26-step system. It’s all very easy…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Wait… Okay. Step 1! Ready.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
A… Okay, Step 2!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…B.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay, hold on. B…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s just the alphabet, that’s… That’s all it is. It’s just—the alphabet goes in a certain order, and that’s the system.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
So Step 3 would be… C.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s right.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I gotta write down Step 4. 4… that’s, um… E? No… D!
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(aside)
So we’re going to let him figure this out.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Step 5. E…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If you enjoy the parts of the show where I don’t teach an imp the alphabet, perhaps you’d like to become one of our Patreon supporters. Go to patreon.com/albasalix to get early access to episodes. Or, what you can also do is use the hash tag #otherbothers on Twitter to talk about the show.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Did you know an N upside down is still an N, Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. We talked about that quite often in my era.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
O… P…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So please… rate and review the show. Tell a friend if you like it, and uh, if you know of any more intelligent imps that you can send our way, it’d be much appreciated.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay, I got all 26 steps written down, Blat. Now… what’s next?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You just stick files that start with each letter on that letter’s shelf.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! So If I were to take your bazooka… Where would I put the bazooka?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, you see, I’m not actually going to let you touch that. See, the only way for that to appear is if I were to say it, and the last thing I want you to do is to get access to my bazooka.
Blat’s bazooka clatters into being.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
WOOOO! Look! The bazooka! Let me touch! I can touch! Oh ho ho ho!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, what have I done?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Hey little flower!
(laughs)
You think you can stop time?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Outside! Outside!
(sighs)
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I’ll show you who can…!
(he imitates the rocket noises)
MORNING AT THE IN:
SEA:
Blat, you are having a dream. There’s Impescor sugars and pastries…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel like I’m having the wrong dream. This is someone else’s dream! Someone that I know quite dearly.
SEA:
And everything’s ordered in the filing cabinets are all sorting them selves.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ooooh, there you go.
Laughter.
SEA:
And there’s the scent, though, this lovely scent of a beautiful breakfast, slowly heating up… when your eyes open and you realize you smell the most amazing breakfast being cooked.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well! I don’t know whether that’s Joe or Darcy who has prepared such a fine repast, but I will certainly take full advantage before we go on another pointless and exceedingly dangerous adventure.
CARTE:
So Blat unfurls his wings from around him, folds them back onto his back…
SEA:
And you are in a beautiful room in an inn.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hmm! I didn’t notice this when it was dark last night. Actually, I would pay more than a silver in night to stay here! Perhaps we did get a bit of a bonus.
CARTE:
Buttons up his shirt… Blat opens the door to the hall.
SEA:
You see Eggerton snoring against the far wall.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(snores)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
When he said first watch, perhaps someone was meant to relieve him. Ah well.
Eggsy!
SEA:
You hear the sound of cooking downstairs.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sleepily)
Yeah, what?
(wakes up)
I am defending our homestead against the forces of evil.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And how’s that going?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I… there’s no evil, so… you’re welcome.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, then! flawless logic. It’s time to wake up! There’s food cooking downstairs. Perhaps this day will begin not totally sucking.
SEA:
So both you ladies, you wake up to the sounds of talking in the hall.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I get up and I peek my head out the door.
SEA:
The room you’re in is beautiful. It is crafted, well tailored…
MARIS:
So I bolt out of the room, and I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re not in the same place anymore! We’ve been teleported! Where are we? Where are we? Aaa! I didn’t go to sleep in this room!
MARIS:
And I look at Blat and Eggerton who are staring at me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is there an evil breakfast being made? Where’s the evil cook?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There’s a breakfast being made. That’s really all I’m concerned about at the moment. Usually when crazy stuff happens, we don’t at least get a meal out of it, so let’s count ourselves lucky thus far.
MAGGI:
And Ananka, who’s been sitting up because she sleep sitting up, gets up to meet the rest of them, and is equally perplexed by the fact that everything suddenly looks so different.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why is it so nice? It was not this nice last night.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I thought it was very nice.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You think everything’s very nice.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Not everything.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(accusing)
Oh, you apologized to that zombie before you gnawed on his face.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It was his back, and he was trying to eat Blat alive? So I don’t feel like you should probably judge me for that. And I did feel pretty bad about it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
Is this Joe’s place still?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I just hope that in the past, Joe is a better cook that he appeared to be in the present. Or the future. Which was our present. Which actually is further in our past. Whatever! I’m going to eat something!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I hope he uses clean utensils.
SEA:
The orange door at the end of the hall opens and a younger-looking man steps out and is sort of staring down at himself, quite perplexed. He’s dressed similarly to the old man you met, but the clothes are much nicer put together, sort of a country feel, sort of a nice flannel and some corduroy pants.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, do his eyes look black. They look kind of black.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, I think they’re just a dark brown.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sure? Really?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m going to go in for a closer look.
MIK:
And I walk towards him.
SEA:
He looks up at you. He’s like,
SEAN (AS YOUNGER JOE)
I’m alive!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, you are, and… What color would you call your eyes right now, kind sir?
SEAN (AS YOUNGER JOE)
I don’t know!
SEA:
And he runs back into the room to look in the mirror.
SEAN (AS YOUNGER JOE)
Uh, they’re still brown.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They’re just brown, everybody. It’s okay. We have a brown-eye situation.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is it Joe?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Joe, is that you?
SEAN (AS YOUNGER JOE)
Uh…. I think so.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s Joe, he says, but I don’t know if we can trust him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well perhaps the breakfast downstairs is being cooked by his wife, who is… not around from last night.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She was dead.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I think it might be a sensitive subject for him though, so you should probably—
SEAN (AS YOUNGER JOE)
My wife is dead?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, no…! Your wife is most likely downstairs cooking breakfast for us all.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But she was dead yesterday, yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Aghhh.
SEA:
Joe runs down the stairs.
SEAN (AS YOUNGER JOE)
Darling!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Trying to tapdance around the D‑word and you just stop right on it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What is going on?! Blat, get your bazookas ready.
MARIS:
And Darcy starts slowly going down the stairs, peeking between the banisters and trying to keep a low profile.
SEA:
You hear talk and some singing coming from the kitchen, a woman’s voice. You hear Joe saying something. There’s sounds of cooking going on, and wonderful scents coming up: cinnamon and chocolate.
MARIS:
So Darcy gets to the kitchen and I…
SEA:
First of all when you hit the main floor… this inn is quite nice. I wouldn’t say it’s stunning, but it’s a well put together inn with standard tables, and everything’s clean and there’s some tapestries hanging on the wall…
MARIS:
So I’m just weaving my way through the tables going nope, nope, nope, nope. Nope nope nope nope. No, this is not what was here last night.
And I walk over to the entrance to the kitchen, and I peek my head around, expecting to see raccoons.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello?
SEA:
You see a woman who is—light is just radiating off of her and she wears a golden crown, and long flowing golden robes. And she is moving from the stove to the pantry and back, and laughing and singing, and Joe is just drinking something and laughing and watching her. And she just spins and catches your eye, and she’s like,
SEAN (AS THE WOMAN)
There you are! Grab a table, Darcy! I’ve got it all under control.
MARIS:
And I’m quite mesmerized by the light that’s emanating from this woman. So I slowly shuffle in and take a seat, and I’m still staring at her in awe.
SEAN (AS THE WOMAN)
I made the table right here in the kitchen for all of you.
SEA:
And she puts down a bowl of oatmeal that has cinnamon and chocolate in it, and she dashes away to the stove. And Joe is just watching her, enraptured.
MIK:
I come down the stairs next.
SEA:
K.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat, you should come she went through overnight cleaning crew did. It’s pretty impressive.
CARTE:
Blat comes downstairs and looks about, very impressed by how nice the inn is. Not at all surprised that they’ve somehow got back in time, because that’s just their lives now.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, my friend. I don’t think this is a cleaning crew that did this. I think once again, we’ve slipped backwards in time.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What do you mean, “once again”?
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This time though, I think perhaps we’ve only gone back, eh, 30, perhaps 40 years? So in the grand scale of things not too badly. Is that oatmeal that I smell? Lovely!
SEA:
Ananka, you’re coming down as well?
MAGGI:
Ananka comes down the stairs. And yes, she feels like she’s not as shocked by the fact that they’ve slipped back through time because it’s very common for her to do this. She didn’t choose to do this, but it just happened, so…
SEA:
Yep. It feels pretty normal.
So all three of you walk into the kitchen, and you see Darcy sort of just blinking and staring her bowl, and this woman who is gleaming light, and is wearing a gleaming crown, in a set of golden robes, is moving around the kitchen and putting down other bowls on the table and utensils, and sort of tousling Joe’s hair every once in a while, and gestures at you all.
SEAN (AS THE WOMAN)
Please, please, please! Eat! You’ve been on the road a long time. Well, give or take.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Mrs. Joe might be an oracle?
SEA:
She laughs, and it’s sort of a song when she laughs. She says,
SEAN (AS THE WOMAN)
You may call me Celene.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello Celene. Um… You’re not what I was expecting from an innkeeper’s wife.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, no, I’m not an innkeeper’s wife!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh no, of course not! You’re merely in an inn, serving us breakfast. How best would you describe yourself, Celene?
SEA:
She laughs.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Why, I’m the goddess of the moon, of course!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Of course you are! The goddess of the moon! Why wouldn’t you be?
They both laugh merrily.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Would you like extra chocolate with that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I would absolutely love that! That would be spectacular! I’ll take my bowl over here while I silently scream into the corner.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Very well!
SEA:
And she brings over some extra chocolate for you—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(a long, muffled scream)
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I too would like extra chocolate.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, but I made something special for you, Eggerton, being as you are one of the fae.
SEA:
And she slides this pile of cakes over towards you, whereas everyone else has oatmeal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Thank You. I like cakes.
MIK:
And I start digging into the cakes.
SEA:
They are unbelievable.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps, tries to talk with his mouth full)
Wha ah you hahe…? So good…
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(playfully)
No no no! Can’t tell my secrets!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs dreamily)
MIK:
And I keep eating.
SEA:
She tousles Eggerton’s hair.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hee hee!
MARIS:
So I like to think I might have a way with goddesses now, so I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! Celene! Goddess of the moon yes. I—
SEA:
She puts a finger right on your lips.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You are very charming, Darcy, but you worship another!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, “worship” is a strong word! But I’m interested in other goddesses… I’m really interested to know why you would appear here in this inn, where Joe is thirty years younger, I want to say…?
SEA:
She laughs—ha ha ha ha!—and then everything gets really dark in the room. She’s like,
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(huge, booming voice)
Because I’m being spited!
(back to normal)
Oh wait, let’s keep this let’s keep this pleasant.
SEA:
And everything gets lighter again and she starts going back to cooking
MARIS:
And I just start eating my oatmeal mechanically.
MAGGI:
And Ananka is also eating her oatmeal, trying to figure out exactly what is happening, because again, her sight is quite unreliable and she can’t really understand why this is happening.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did anyone else notice it get really dark just now?
SEA:
She goes,
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Shh. Shush, shush, shush. It’s all good. Enjoy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, they’re very good cakes. But it got dark and it’s light outside, so I don’t know why it would get dark like that—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(sharply)
Pssst! Psst!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh… Yeah? What?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
That’s enough.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. I’m just trying to solve the mystery of the dark room.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Psst! Pst pst pst pst!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Oh, fine! I’m going to sit and eat—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Blat takes a spoonful of his yogurt and lobs it at Eggerton’s head.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Awww…
MAGGI:
Where did you get yogurt?
MARIS:
Yeah, when did you get yogurt?
Laughter.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Ohh. I would kill for some Greek yogurt right now.
SEA:
Okay, she puts some yogurt in front of you.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Thank you.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
So we don’t have a lot of time. Who has questions?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Good! Because I have some things that I want to say.
So. I believe you are trying to reach the Oracle.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
That is correct.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Mmm hmm. I don’t have much time. I really shouldn’t be here during the day, as I’m sure you know. But…
(furious)
I need you to do something about what they’re doing!
SEA:
And the room gets dark again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
That’s the dark room thing I was talking about before.
MAGGI:
And Ananka is unfazed by this, because she’s encountered such beings before.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Clearly.
MAGGI:
And asks,
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
What do you need us to do?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(booming)
I don’t know. Everything is corrupted. Everything!
(normal again)
Oh, excuse my manners. Everything is corrupted. Nothing can be trusted.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I have sensed this too. There’s been darkness in my visions and things I thought were safe are no longer safe. I need to understand why this is happening. I’m having trouble. This is not usually what happens. I usually have no trouble seeing what I need to see.
MAGGI:
And she looks around pensively, because she doesn’t want anyone to really have an idea that she’s kind of doubting her abilities.
SEA:
The Goddess laughs.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Ha ha ha! Well, us goddesses are not having that problem. That would be insane! We are gods and goddesses!
The Old One is waking. And she is playing games.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um… frog cult?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, the frogs! You want to talk about the frogs!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t need to talk about the frogs…
SEAN (AS CELENE)
The Wardens of the New Moon, they call themselves! They are not related to me. They are not related to the moon at all. They are evil. Evil! They walk with the Old One herself.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
When did this start happening?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I’m not sure.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Our plan… our timeline—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(booming)
I care not for your timeline!
SEA:
And the room gets dark again.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
The world is out of balance, partly because of your meddling!
(bright and happy again)
But… You are here and you are travelling to see the Oracle. Which just happens to be the temple of the Old One! So, so, so! Perhaps you could just tie it all up in a pretty bow!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What happened to Roderick, the raccoon I met? He was very friendly and then these hands came and took me away and I couldn’t play with him anymore.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I’ll return you to Roderick shortly.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you.
MAGGI:
And Ananka’s quite annoyed by the goddess’s attitude, because she resents the meddling accusation… Even though she knows that she’s technically meddling a little bit.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me, Moon Goddess?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you trying to say that there’s someone at the Oracle that you don’t like, and you need help disposing of…?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Like a goddess needs the help of mortals! Please! I’m simply saying that you’re in an opportune time for the balance to shift.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t really understand all the balance stuff. We were just supposed to come here for the Oracle. Is the oracle still at the Oracle place?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! Well, that’s good. We thought she was dead.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Nope! Not dead.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Is she speaking?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
No. Not speaking at all.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is that because of the Old One?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ooh. I think I’m getting this.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I think I need to slow down for you mortals.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Little bit. Little bit.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I resent that.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Could I have some more chocolate to go with my—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
NO!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So… we go to the Oracle who is being… kept prisoner by this Old One you’re talking about? And we free the oracle. Right? Is that what you’re talking about?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I give up.
Well! Good luck to you all.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! Wait! But! I like chocolate! No!
SEA:
And the room just—zooomp!—resets, and all the food is gone.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(a stricken gasp)
SEA:
It’s cobwebs and no fire. And you hear a chariot lifting off outside and heading off into the sky.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
One of them sky chariots are outside.
MARIS:
Is Joe old again?
SEA:
Yeah, you don’t see Joe.
MARIS:
Ohh.
CARTE:
Blat runs upstairs and knocks on the red door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Joe?
SEA:
There’s no answer.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sadly)
Oh, Joe.
CARTE:
Blat slowly opens the door.
SEA:
You see a room that’s actually kept quite perfect from where it was. You see a bunch of tapestries, like, too many on the walls, as if all the tapestries downstairs were all put up here. But they’re old and dusty… and you see a skeleton laying on the bed.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(brightly)
All right…
CARTE:
Blat slowly closes the door again, walks downstairs to see the others…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat, did you did you wake Joe? Was he up there?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes! Joe was up there and said that this is something that sometimes happens… and all we need to do is go to the Oracle place and investigate for ourselves. Joe is just an old man who wants us to take care of this problem.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wow. Well, okay, I guess he must know something then…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yep. Good old Joe…
So have we all had our fill of imaginary oatmeal and yogurt?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Excellent. So. Off we go ito a several-hour journey to the Oracle who’s being held by the Old One.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
So, as they were assured by Joe that the path is still the same, they follow the path to the Oracle.
SEA:
So you exit outside the inn. As you all step out into the morning light you see that there is the chicken hut sitting outside the inn.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hi, Chicken Hut!
SEA:
It sidles over towards Eggerton and leans into you.
MIK:
I give it a good stroke along the side.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I suppose we’ll save time if we travel in this ridiculous domicile.
SEA:
And the door opens, and… Darcy and Blat, you see the minotaur standing in the doorway.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s the minotaur!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll handle this! Bazooka!
The bazooka appears.
MAGGI:
(laughs)
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Would you put away that goddamn bazooka?
Grishka! Greg! Oh my god, where did you go?
SEAN (AS GREG THE MINOTAUR)
I’m sorry Ananka. I had to do something.
SEA:
And he steps out of the chicken hut and starts approaching you all.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The last time I met this minotaur, he bagged and tagged and roofied me and I wound up in this ridiculous era.
SEA:
He nods to you, Blat, and turns to Darcy.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Darcy. It’s good to see you made it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(stiffly)
Thank you. How are you?
SEAN (AS GREG)
I’m fine. I’m sorry for what I had to do, but I’m glad I saved you both. And You too, little one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who are you?
SEA:
And he turns to Ananka.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Ananka… you have to come with me.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I will follow wherever you need me to go, Greg.
SEAN (AS GREG)
No, you don’t understand.
I’m the one who told the Shattering.
MAGGI:
…and Ananka just looks like she’s been stabbed in the back five million times.
SEAN (AS GREG)
I’ll explain. I’m trying to fix it.
MAGGI:
She’s speechless.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel perfectly justified in calling for my soul weapon. He is responsible for the Shattering! He is the reason why I am here beside a chicken house and not at some future point in time, sleeping in my orthopedic bed.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat. He might be the only one who knows how to get us out of here. Just be quiet for a minute!
SEAN (AS GREG)
Ananka. You have to come with me. We only have a small window to fix this.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Why should I ever trust you again?
(sighs)
I saved you. I tried to help you. This is all because of you.
SEAN (AS GREG)
It’s not. It’s because of what they tried to do. They tried to destroy everything, not me, Ananka. I made a mistake.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Well, it’s a pretty big one, Greg.
SEAN (AS GREG)
I know.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
We have to fix it.
SEAN (AS GREG)
I know. You have to come with me. But someone needs to reach the Oracle.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(exhales)
We have to make a decision.
MAGGI:
So Ananka turns to all three of her companions and hopes one of them speaks up and is happy to take on the task.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry. Am I understanding this correctly? You… are going with the minotaur and leaving us? Here?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Not all of you. Just one has to go. We can’t abandon this part of our mission.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hmm. Let’s See. What do I want to do? Go with my kidnapper? Or perhaps moving forward and solving this whole moon goddess Celene-Idries situation. I choose Idries!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You can’t go to the Oracle alone! No one can go there alone. We don’t know what waits there.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I still have questions… Why—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He put you in a bag when he put you in this era. That’s why you’re here, okay? That’s who the minotaur is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ohh.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Darcy. I feel there is something magical in you. I feel she will recognize this, and you are the one with the most chance for her speaking again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Gee, no pressure. Well, what do you think, Mr. Minotaur? Am I supposed to go to the Oracle? Do you know anything?
SEAN (AS GREG)
I’m afraid I made a lot of this mess. Darcy… I’m not sure. I’m just trying to do the right thing.
(sighs)
I need Ananka to come with me but someone has to reach the Oracle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine. Blat and I will go to the Oracle. Eggerton, are you coming to the Oracle?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(nervous)
Why is everyone looking at me like that?
Uh…
ANNOUNCE:
There may be strength in numbers.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay… I’ll go with Blat and Darcy, because they’ve got bazookas and… I’ll go with them.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Good. Because I wouldn’t trust him with you. I barely trust him with myself. I’d rather walk with the devil myself than have you three face it with him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well that settles it, then!
SEA:
So Greg gets back into the chicken hut.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
My three. I have faith in you. I know you will make it. This is what you have been waiting for. This is what you’ve been training for. Please, go. And take care of yourselves. Take care of each other.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay! With me in charge. Nothing bad could possibly happen.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
One of us is actually in charge, right?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Let’s go forth, Teeeam Fairy!
MAGGI:
Ananka reluctantly enters the hut and goes with Greg.
SEA:
The door closes and the hut starts running off down the road.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel like there’s a lot there that’s remained unsaid.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
She just left us here. In the middle of nowhere. With an oracle and an Old One and a Goddess of the Moon and a frog cult.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Don’t forget about Joe. He seemed pretty nice.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And Eggerton is our leader. I don’t have a good feeling about this.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’d say we would be better off with Ananka, but all we usually get is, “I’m sorry, I don’t know why this isn’t working.” So really we’re no worse off. We don’t have a chicken house, so frankly, I think we’re ahead of the game. Now… l let’s walk for several hours so we’re good and exhausted before we actually meet anything of any import.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Which came first, the chicken house or Ananka?
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, what will really blend your brain is… Where did the chicken house come from? Was there an egg house?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe it was just an egg apartment.
SEA:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now you’ve blended my brain.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I’m the new leader. Let’s go.

Last time on the End of Time and Other Bothers…
SEA:
There’s a sign, and it reads: “The Final Inn”.
SEAN (AS JOE)
Not much happens since the Oracle stopped speaking.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The Oracle stopped speaking? Shouldn’t you have known about this?
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
This is the first I’ve heard of this.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Why, I’m the goddess of the moon, of course!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Of course you are!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(booming)
The world is out of balance, partly because of your meddling!
(bright and happy again)
But… You are travelling to see the Oracle. Which just happens to be the temple of the Old One!
SEAN (AS JOE)
Frog sort of people? They call themselves the Slaad.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
The Wardens of the New Moon, they call themselves! They are evil.
SEA:
And the room just—zooomp!—resets, and all the food is gone. It’s cobwebs…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Joe?
SEA:
You see a skeleton laying on the bed.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sadly)
Oh, Joe.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hi, Chicken Hut!
SEA:
And the door opens, and… you see the minotaur standing in the doorway.
SEAN (AS GREG THE MINOTAUR)
I’m the one who told the Shattering. I’m sorry Ananka.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I saved you. I tried to help you. This is all because of you!
SEAN (AS GREG)
It’s not. You have to come with me. We only have a small window to fix this. But someone needs to reach the Oracle.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
My three. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You… are going with the minotaur and leaving us? Here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Let’s go forth, Teeeam Fairy!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I’m the new leader. Let’s go.
PARTY, HOL:
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think there’s something in my shoe.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Other than your foot, what can there possibly be in your shoe?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Like a stone or something? I dunno, it’s kind of pokey.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, all right, just stop for a second and take it out.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Everybody! Hold party! Shoe inspection. Oh, no, it’s all good. Shoe back on. Let’s move forward, party.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, let’s go.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Moving forward.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, it’s still—there’s still something pokey! I don’t… Okay, everyone hold. Wait a second.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Stopping.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Take my shoe off… this time I’ll take my sock off… Nope, there’s nothing there. I don’t get it.
Oh well. Party forward!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Here we go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Now my other foot hurts.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
Do you want to check your other shoe?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no I’m sure it’s fine. I’m sure it’s nothing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Very good.
They walk in silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You know what, I think we probably should, though, because it’ll bother me if I don’t check it and it turns out to be something. I mean you don’t want to get a little infection the bottom of your foot when you’re walking for a long time, then it’ll slow everyone down later, so it’s probably better time management-wise if we stop now and I take a look.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Time management-wise, you could have checked four times during that sentence. Just check your shoe!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay. Party hold!
No, there’s nothing in there! That’s so funny! I guess… maybe it’s—what is it when you think there’s something wrong and then—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(growls)
Psychosomatic.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah! Psychosomatic stone in my shoe.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s what it is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yep. Psychosomatic stone in my shoe. PSS.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let’s go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay. Here we go! Party forward!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Are those even your shoes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Wait. You know these aren’t my shoes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, no. My shoes are a different colour than this. These aren’t my shoes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
These are Joe’s shoes. You’re wearing Joe’s shoes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think you’re… well, okay. We’ll all head back. We should all head back actually, and I’ll change them out for my shoes and then we can get going again. It won’t take that long.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You stole Joe’s shoes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I didn’t steal Joe’s shoes! I just put on a pair of shoes that were next to where my shoes were and they kind of fit.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know if we have time to go back and get his shoes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look, we’ve only been on the road for like a minute and a half. We’ve got a long way to go. Let’s just head back, get the shoes and then we can go again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think Blat should get the shoes. You’re going to get distracted by raccoons again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m not going to get distracted by—there’s a raccoon? Where’s the raccoon?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
Oh gosh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I never got to talk to the raccoon…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, go. Go get the shoes, Blat. We’ll wait here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fine.
CARTE:
And Blat flies off towards the Final Inn.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So how are you doing, Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How did you even think those were your shoes? They look like old man shoes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but I never look down a lot, and when I look down, I can’t always see my shoes, because I’ve got a bit of a belly and…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh brother. We’re never going to get to this Oracle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m sure we’ll get there.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Here are your shoes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ah! That was quick.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Roderick says hello.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! How is Roderick?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t care. Just keep moving.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay, no, we’ve got to put the new shoes on. Hold on. Let me sit, get these off… put these back on… wiggle around. Okay, that’s better! Can you take Joe’s shoes back?
CARTE:
Blat takes Joe’s shoes from Eggerton, holds them in his hands… and they burst into flame.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that was kind of rude.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s fine.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, what’s Joe going to walk around in now?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Trust me. Joe has… nothing to worry about walking-wise any longer.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What… what does that mean? I mean, he was very up and moving around…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Your shoes are on the wrong feet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, party hold!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)

Episode 10: Journey to the Temple, Part 3.
FLASH FORWAR:
Peaceful birdsong and distant city sounds.
SEA:
We open in the suburbs: green grass, cobbled streets. It’s a hot day with a nice breeze… And an orderly is walking past us, past a sign, into a large building with two wings, and the sign reads: The Rusty Scabbard. And beneath it in small print, it reads: Oxidised But Not Forgotten.
And as the orderly goes to open the door, an older demon man shambles out, bumbling and apologizing, and using a walker… and passes out into the street. And the camera’s torn: do we go inside? But then it turns and follows this older half-demon who, once he gets about 500 feet out of sight of the old age home, he tosses aside the walker and starts humming to himself as he heads towards his destination… which is a coffee shop on the corner.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
(sings)
I’m going to eat… half-decent food! I’m going to eat… half-decent food! No more old man slop…
The bell on the front door jingles. The street sounds fade.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Ahhh! Hello?
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Oh! Hello, welcome, welcome! Can I—oh, no, you have to order up here.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Oh! I’m terribly sorry. I haven’t done this in a while.
(conspiratorial whisper)
I live in a home.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Oh yes, I remember you! Uh… Bruce?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Blat.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Blat. I’m so sorry.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
It’s close.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Welcome, welcome. Please, what can I get you? We have a line of mochas, coffees, semi-sweet sweets…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
It’s too much to choose from. All right. My good woman, here’s what I want. I want you to bring me something they would not serve in an old folks’ home. Something good! You know, real… mmmm!—that’s not grey slop. Just something, here, right in front of me…
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Okay, yes! Do they serve pudding? I have this lovely pudding—
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Pudding? We’re drowning in pudding! No! Give me something—
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Uh… scones?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I don’t even know what that is! Bring that out. Bring scones.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
All right. Here, I’ll get you… Would you like it heated up? Lukewarm?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Heated? Ohh! They never ask us any of that. It’s just “Here’s your slop…”
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Heated up, then?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Yes… No. Wait! I think I can do that.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Oh, okay.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Just bring me a scone.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Here you go, sir. And what would you like to drink?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Uh…
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
We have mint mocha, carob mocha…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Not-home drink. Not-home drink.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Not-home drink.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
What do they not serve at the home?
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Oh. Do they do they serve coffee mochas?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I don’t know what that is.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
It’s sort of our specialty. I’ll make a small one up for you.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Okay, here we go! Just gonna hold this scone in my hands and think really hard…
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Here you go, sir. Here’s the mocha.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
It’s happening. It’s happening!
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Oh. Is something on fire? Oh, I think I left the toaster on. I’ll be right back!
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Ahhh! Still got it.
The front door opens.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Oh hi there, Blat! How are you doing buddy? What are you doing?
A smoke detector beeps shrilly.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
The alarm’s going off! Sorry! Sorry!
Chaos.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
No, that’s—that’s—
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
My scone! My scone! I did something to the scone.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
I got it off.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Oh, did someone let him try and heat up his own food?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Uh…
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
What?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
You let him—you can’t let him heat up his own food.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I can still do it! I still got it.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yeah, you sure do, buddy! Why don’t you go have a seat. I’ll get you a nice hot scone.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Madam, I’m terribly sorry about the scone.
(whispers)
I’m from the future, you know.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Okay. Yes. We’re all from the future, Blat.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Are you paying for his?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yeah, I’ll… I’ll take care of that. So I’ll have a black coffee with eight sugar.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
And can I also get seven pleather creams?
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Yes.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
And I’ll have a scone heated, with some black pepper on it if you can.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Black pepper. On the scone.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
On the scone, yes.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Oh, so a savory scone!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Sure. We’ll have that. All right, and we’ll just be over here. Bring that over when it’s ready, please.
Blat, old fellow! How are you doing? I’m so glad you were able to get away.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I’m eating a scone!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Well, you’re eating what was a scone, yes, and we’ve got another one coming…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
They don’t serve these in the home!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
No, they don’t, after what you did to the scone machine. But that’s okay. That’s why we don’t say the B‑word anymore! So, how are you? What’s been new?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Well, yesterday they bathed me!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
That’s, that’s… nice. Um, did they get both sides?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Uh… Let me check!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Oh. Yeah. Okay. So maybe we’ll just tie the robe closed? We’ll keep that closed…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
No, I think I’m good! I’m clean on both sides.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yep. I can see—everyone in here can see that, Blat. Why don’t you close the robe over…
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Here’s your coffee, sir.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Thank you.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Um, is he okay?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Oh he’s just fine. He’s having a good time, thanks…
The front door bell jingles.
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Oh, another customer just came in. I’ll be back.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh! Eggerton! Ha, sorry! I just got my gear here. Let me just wheel it over…
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
All right! Welcome. Slide in next to me.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
I’m just gonna put that there. I’ll put the mic right here, the mics—is that okay?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh, is this Blat?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Blat?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
(startled)
Aaa!
I’m eating a scone!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes! And this is my friend.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Rando, hi.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Rando.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Hi, nice to meet you, Blat. I’m really honoured. I’ve been hearing all about your tales, and I got really excited when Eggerton said we could hear both of you together today.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yeah, I thought it would be a lot of fun, Blat! We’ll talk about our adventures in the past!
Silence.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I’m clean on both sides!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes, well, you don’t need to show, though.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I’m sorry. I did it again.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
So, Blat… Rando here is going to make us famous. Everyone in Farloria reads his blog.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Um, well, not everyone yet. But I’m hoping, you know!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes, we’re hopeful it’s everyone, and they’ll tell all of their friends and then even more of everyone will read the blog!
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So let me just—
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
It’s going to be so much fun, and everyone in all of Farloria is going to know about our adventures!
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh boy.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Nobody believes me when I tell a story.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
I believe you, Blat.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Well, you were there! Here. Let’s see if he believes me. Rando!
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Yes.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
My friend and I are actually from centuries in your future!
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Yes, he’s told me.
Silence.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Well, all right then! Let’s begin.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Okay, so I’ll guess I’ll recap where you got us to, Eggerton, so far?
Okay. So I think where we are, Blat, is Eggerton has just saved the day and fought off the witch, and the goddess of the moon at the inn and then led you valiantly past some chicken hut on your way to see the… what is it? Uh… it’s the oracle of… or Oracle Idries.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes! Idries the Oracle.
(raises his voice)
Remember? Do you remember Idries, Blat? Idries, after the chicken house?
SEAN (AS RANDO)
That you slayed.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes, I slayed the chicken house valiantly.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Slayed? You couldn’t slay anything!
(to Rando)
In the future time, he worked as a public relations… expert, if you want to use the E‑word, which around him I definitely would not.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Yes. Wasn’t he the head of Public Relations?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
The head of Public…? No! He was a flunky! At least I knew I was a flunky, but I was happy with that.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
So Blat, he’s old, he gets a little confused sometimes. That’s okay. Some of the details may be a bit hazy. We’ll go over it afterwards and help you sort out some of the details here.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So you left us in our last session where you were on the path to this temple…
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
And you said there were these Slaad.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yeah, the Slaad.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So I believe you were in front with your giant sword.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes! Do you remember my giant sword, Blat?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Well, what I remember is that… well, who used to actually take care of business was our good friend Darvin. Remember Darvin? He was great, wasn’t he? Darvin also came from the future. Like us.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Darvin? I don’t have a Darvin…
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
No, he means Darcy, who was my aide-de-camp.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Yes, yes.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
But you know, I don’t like talking about Darcy after what happened between us. It was a very torrid, torrid affair and I feel—
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
You and Darvin?!
MIK:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I’ll admit, back then I thought maybe I would have a chance with Darvin, but… you? But all you did was chew on fairy cakes! That was all you did! Me, I learned I had this special ability where a metal tube would appear in my hands—
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
No, no, don’t, we can’t! Don’t say the B‑word. No B‑word.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
What B‑word?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
When I said a certain word…
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
(lowers his voice)
See, if he said the word bazooka really loud…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I’m going to say the word now!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
No, don’t say—don’t say the word.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
BA… NANA!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Okay, that was close.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
What’s supposed to happen?
MIK:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
It was supposed to… I haven’t done it in so long. That might not be the word.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So maybe, Blat, you could tell me what you remember? It was a hot day, I’m told, and you were heading on the way to the temple…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
(fondly)
I remember… there was a beautiful woman who called herself the goddess of the moon. And she made us breakfast. And that is the least surprising part of this story.
We had to walk a great distance because the chicken house left, and took a very unreliable witch with her. She was dating a man who looked like a bull, who told us he was responsible for the end of time—dear lord, I do said like a rambling crazy person. How does this make any sense?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
I was in front with the sword. Darcy was behind me.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Okay, yep, yep.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
She was a little afraid, but you know, I was protecting her. And then Blat was in the back with his bazooka making sure nothing snuck up on us.
THE SLAA:
Birds sing, deep in the forest.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whining)
Guys, wait uuup! It’s been too long and my legs hurt and you won’t let me eat a fairy cake.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hurry up! We have to get to this Oracle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Besides, we’ve been walking for seven minutes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s just so hot outside, and I didn’t bring any extra water and you won’t let me eat the fairy cakes and… just maybe a little bit and it’ll give me a pop so I can keep going?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We give you three canteens of water. You drank them in seven minutes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You drank my canteen of water?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you don’t need water, Blat! You’ll just turn it into steam, right?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well I am half human! See, Darcy, this is why I appreciate that you’re here. You’re really the reason why any of this works. You’re so important to me, Darcy. I’m never going to forget you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Gee, Blat. That’s a really nice thing to say!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m sorry… just spending too much time with this other one, I tend to go a little bit crazy. I’m just glad that you’re here.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
(in a thick, lisping voice)
Halt, there! Halt!
SEA:
Ahead of you—you all freeze on this path, I assume—and ahead of you, out of the brush, steps a Slaad.
You see a hooded figure. You see shiny red skin. Hulking, large, humanoid—but with what you could only refer to as maybe toad-like features in the face? And long arms that go all the way to the ground that end in red claws that are quite long.
And on the robe is emblazoned a moon. And this is where, Blat, you are going to do a Spout Lore roll.
CARTE:
(sings as he rolls)
Going to… spout some lore… once I roll… a 7.
MARIS:
…more than 4.
MIK:
(laughs)
Oh, that would have been a good one.
SEA:
So this would be… Do you get an Intelligence bonus? Roll +Intelligence?
CARTE:
That would be a 1. So I have an 8.
SEA:
So I will tell you something interesting, probably not useful.
CARTE:
(laughs)
Sounds like my entire educational experience.
Laughter.
CARTE:
“Here’s an interesting fact that will do you no good later on in life.”
SEA:
You recognize the Slaad as demon brethren.
MARIS:
Ooo.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Halt! Who goes there?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It is I! A fellow red-skinnèd traveler. We’re actually trying to, um, get to a vacation spot not too far from here. Perhaps you could help us out. It’s some sort of a temple, perhaps?
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
You go to our temple?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I didn’t realize it was your temple… But we seem to be similar! Perhaps distant cousins of some kind. Would it be so bad if I and these two other non-red-skinnèd people came to visit your temple?
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
You must come to the temple.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now we must come to the temple. So before it seemed like you didn’t want us to come to the temple. But now we must come to the temple.
SEA:
Darcy, you sense movement on both sides of the trail in the forest, and you catch sight of a hooded figure moving beside you. And you sense other movement on the other side.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
I think we’re being surrounded.
MIK:
I grip my stick tightly and hide behind Darcy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So is there a faster way to get to the temple? The other fellow here, he’s been complaining about the walking.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Yes. We will carry you to the temple.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
…did he say “carry us to the temple” or “kill us to the temple”?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(whispers)
See, I don’t think “kill us to the temple” is grammatically correct.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
I heard “gill us to the temple”.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sir, did you say you would carry us to the temple?
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Yes!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
See, it’s “carry us to the temple”.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s very nice of them. I was a little afraid at first but they seem quite kind.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Kneel on the ground! Put your hands behind your head!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…that doesn’t sound so kind.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is this a helpful carrying-to-the-temple? Are we being… oh, are we being captured?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are we being sacrificed?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is there going to be snacks?
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
I will carry you to the temple.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is the fastest way to get to the temple. I think we should just—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Sir? Sir.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
The name is Fath.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Faphth?
SEAN (AS FATH)
Fath.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Fath.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fath.
SEAN (AS FATH)
Fath, yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fath. So he’s Fath.
SEAN (AS FATH)
Kneel on the ground! Put your hands behind your head!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, again, I don’t see why we need to kneel on the ground and put our hands behind our head, but—fine. If it’ll get us to the temple faster.
MIK:
I kneel and put my hands behind my head.
MARIS:
I kneel and put my hands behind my head.
CARTE:
I kneel and put my hands behind my head.
SEAN (AS FATH)
Glytha! Put them on the pole!
SEA:
And they’re bringing two large poles in and and the Slaad demons are coming around with rope…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t like this.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know if I want to be put on a pole.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t want to be poled.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fath…
SEA:
They all halt immediately. They stop.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is it truly necessary to tie us to poles and carry us as if we’re yesterday’s groceries?
SEAN (AS FATH)
Hmm. You may fight one of us.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I may…? I didn’t want to a start a fight, why am I…? Can’t we just settle this like mature, red-skinnèd gentlemen? My two friends and I do not wish to be tied to a pole. Do you have a wagon of some sort that we may travel in?
SEAN (AS FATH)
We have the pole.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just poles. Not much of a—
SEAN (AS FATH)
Or you may fight us all. We give you the honour of demonhood. One at a time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, I thought he just had to fight one of you. Now he has to fight all of you?
SEAN (AS FATH)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, Blat, we’ll be over here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wait, what?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m going to go over here and hide behind this rock.
(whispers)
Darcy, quick! Over here.
(aloud)
Go team Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, gentlemen. I see that perhaps…
SEAN (AS FATH)
Hold on a second. Lasbo?
SEAN (AS LASBO)
Yes!
SEAN (AS FATH)
Do you want fight him to the death as a demonborn?
SEAN (AS LASBO)
No!
SEAN (AS FATH)
Okay. Glytha!
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
Yes!
SEAN (AS FATH)
Do you want to fight him to the death as a demonborn?
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
Okay!
SEAN (AS FATH)
Very good. Glytha will be the first to fight you.
SEA:
And one of them starts taking off their robe, and their arms are quite long, but they’re quite humanoid and very demonborn. And very long claws.
SEAN (AS FATH)
This is Glytha. Glytha, meet…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Blat. Pleased to meet—
SEA:
They all take a step back when you say your name.
SEAN (AS FATH)
It is he! Very well. Glytha, meet Blat—the Chosen.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did he say “Chosen”?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think he said “Chosen”. If he’s the Chosen, why are you fighting him?
SEAN (AS FATH)
Because he won’t get on the pole.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well… if I am indeed chosen, and for what, I am certain I do not know, I don’t see why I need to travel by pole. Now… all right. If we’re to fight, let me just do one little thing first. It’s a two step process.
SEAN (AS FATH)
Glytha, attack!
SEA:
Glytha charges you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sadly)
Oh, Glytha…
SEA:
Pretty fast, as a lumbering… like, she’s using her hands and her feet, and charging. And the claws are, I’d say five inches long.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
SEA:
Okay. And as you call Bazooka, you need to roll Defy Danger. There is an incoming Slaad Warden of the New Moon, with glistening claws.
Carter rolls.
MARIS:
Oo, that’s pretty good.
CARTE:
That’s a 10.
SEA:
Damn!
MARIS:
It’s a natural 10.
SEA:
So what’s your Dex? Anyway, it doesn’t matter, you succeed. That is a full success. What do you want to have happen?
CARTE:
As a bazooka fills my hand, I flip the bazooka up end over end, and connect with her chin as she charges at me.
SEA:
Roll your damage, which is d8.
CARTE:
Aw, 1?!
SEA:
So you clock Glytha good, and she goes flying backwards, lands on her back, and all of the Slaad around you go
SEAN (AS SLAAD ONLOOKERS)
Whumpa, whumpa, whumpa!
SEA:
And she starts getting up and turns, hissing at you—hsssss!—and is about to attack.
CARTE:
I then flip my bazooka back around the other way… and fire at a tree outside of the group.
SEA:
Okay let’s roll Volley.
CARTE:
6… plus my Dex. 7.
SEA:
That’s barely…! Okay, so the missile zooms out, hits a tree. The tree goes up in a big ball of flame, but she takes that moment to actually swipe with her long arm at you as she like moves around to your side… and you’re going to take 7 hit points of damage.
Groans around the table.
CARTE:
So she clocks me really good.
SEA:
Yeah. But they all they are now turned—they almost don’t see that. The rest of them all turn to watch this tree explode into flame and they’re all going,
SEAN (AS SLAAD ONLOOKERS)
Whumpa, whumpa, whumpa! The Chosen! The Chosen! Whumpa, whumpa, whumpa!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Woompa, woompa! Uh… woompa…
(whispers)
Blat, get up! I’m distracting them for you!
Woompa!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
Stop whumpa-ing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, sorry.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, as you can see, I can make things explode. Now, you may be large and powerful, but maybe we can call it a draw—
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
To the death!
SEA:
Defy Danger. She’s coming for you.
CARTE:
6.
SEA:
So… she just tackles you, and you just—halfway through Blat’s speech, he’s just taken out, like a by a bus. And he goes flying backwards and ends up in a tangle on the ground and the Slaad is on top of you, hissing, and is basically going to try and bite you. What do you want to do?
CARTE:
Try to get the bazooka into her mouth.
Laughter.
SEA:
Let’s roll Defy Danger.
CARTE:
To prevent biting from happening.
7.
SEA:
Okay, so you manage to get the bazooka into her mouth but she actually just crimps down on it, and it literally just crimps it into a piece of flat metal in the middle. And she’s just hissing and the venom coming out of her mouth is dripping down on you and it’s acidic. Uh, do you have any natural… against acid? I don’t remember.
CARTE:
Uh… The only natural thing I have against acid is—oh yes, I see it written here. “Just avoid acid.”
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay, so you take another 2 hit points of damage as the acid’s coming down on your chest.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Was that acid?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think so. He looks pretty hurt. Wait, wait! I have an idea.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat! Open wide!
Laughter.
MIK:
I reach into my bag and take out a fairy ball. And throw it as hard as I can towards Blat’s mouth, from behind the rock.
SEA:
As in, a fairy cake shaped like a ball?
MIK:
Yes. Like those little snowballs you get at Christmas.
MARIS:
With coconut on it.
SEA:
Roll Volley. So this would be a Volley, with a +Dex.
MIK:
11!
MARIS:
Oh my God.
Laughter.
SEA:
So literally, Eggerton stands up, winds up and throws the fairy cake right down your mouth and all the way down your throat. You don’t even get to chew it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(choking down the cake)
Hagh! Aghhh!
SEA:
Roll Fairy Cakes.
MIK:
Rolling Fairy Cakes. This is +Wisdom, I believe?
SEA:
Yeah, you should be rolling +Wisdom.
MIK:
Yeah, +Wisdom. That is 10!
MARIS:
Wow.
SEA:
Just barely. What’s the healing on it?
MIK:
(laughs)
The healing, it is… “heal them d8 + Wisdom.” That was successful, so d8…
SEA:
Do you have a Wisdom bonus?
MIK:
That is 11.
SEA:
You get 11 hit points back.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIK:
Fairy cakes to the rescue.
SEA:
I’m sort of picturing the Popeye thing, where the spinach goes right down his throat and your whole body goes whump—whump—whump! and your arms whumma-whumma!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton! I’m impressed!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So am I!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That was a really good throw!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know what happened!
SEAN (AS FATH)
Another combatant has entered!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I—I—I didn’t enter…
SEA:
And one of the Slaad starts taking their robe off and approaching Eggerton.
MARIS:
Uh-oh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I did not actually enter… I stayed back.
SEAN (AS FATH)
There is a second contestant in the battle!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I—okay, I… all right…
SEA:
And that Slaad is now charging and the Slaad on top of you, Glytha, is trying to get the metal out of her mouth so she can chomp down on your shoulder.
CARTE:
Just shoving my now crunched bazooka further into her.
SEA:
Okay. Roll Defy Danger. You’re basically just trying to keep her from biting you.
CARTE:
6… + Dex is a 7.
SEA:
She bites all the way through it and then comes down and chomps right down on your shoulder…
CARTE:
Ohhh!
SEA:
For d8 +… that’s 6 damage, and—do you have armor, by the way? You don’t.
CARTE:
No.
MIK:
He has a buttoned-down white dress shirt.
SEA:
So that is 6 damage.
So you see the Slaad demon bite right down into his chest, like right on his shoulder. And there is a Slaad charging Eggerton.
MIK:
Darcy Darcy Darcy I’m scared Darcy Darcy I’m scared scared what do I do what do I do what do I do what do I do what do I do oh God I’m gonna run I’m gonna run.
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger for running.
MIK:
That is 7.
SEA:
Okay. So Eggerton takes out in a dead run—and clotheslines himself right on a branch, flipping himself up and around the branch and hits the ground for 3 hit points of damage.
But the Slaad is so taken by surprise they charge right past Eggerton and into the forest, off the trail. Eggerton is now dazed on the ground.
MIK:
Ow.
MARIS:
Okay, so when I see that the Slaad has chomped down on Blat’s shoulder, I believe? I pick up the large stick that Eggerton dropped, and I run over and I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Get off him!
MARIS:
And I take a whack at her back.
SEA:
Okay! Roll Hack and Slash.
MARIS:
Is that just two…?
SEA:
Yeah, 2d6.
MARIS:
It’s a 4.
(laughs)
SEA:
Okay, so you do. You connect, you’re beating at the back of Glytha, and Glytha’s just sort of ignoring you.
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
Ah hah hah! I shall eat him!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Stop it! Let go of him!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The sticks! We’ll travel by sticks! I don’t mind any more!
SEAN (AS FATH)
He has spoken! Do you all concur?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(weakly)
Yes!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I guess so?
SEAN (AS FATH)
Then please kneel and put your hands behind your head.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll have you know, I was trying to spare you from the bazooka shell. But I see it now that was a mistake.
SEA:
Glytha bows to you—
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
Oh, the Chosen One. Thank you for the battle.
SEA:
And backs away.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is a very strange form of worship that’s going on here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s tough love.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I jog back over, out of breath and a little dazed.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That was a good shot, my friend. I feel like there’s far too much sugar in my system, but… there’s too many of them. Just kneel down and put your hands over your head.
MIDROL:
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey. Sean here. All right, this week I want to introduce all of you to a very special actual play podcast with some of the sweetest people ever and I’ve totally fallen in love with it. Four friends come together for adventure and to play D&D, and they don’t let the fact that two of them have moved to the other side of the world stop them. I just love this show so much and I look forward to it every week in my feed. Search for Dumbgeons and Dragons anywhere you listen to podcasts, or visit dumbdragons.com.
A PAID MESSAG:
Ominous music.
MIK:
(ominous voice)
Celene wants to be in charge.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(sweetly)
Okay, everyone, just move that over three—I SAID THREE FEET!
MIK:
Celene thinks she can do what she wants with the Slaad.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, aren’t you a pretty little thing.
MIK:
Celene wants to be in charge of your life.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh no, it’s fine! You can all just—DIE NOW.
MIK:
But there’s another opportunity. Loxsyn.
Loxsyn’s soothing theme plays.
MIK:
You can follow Loxsyn using the hashtag #otherbothers. You can throw your support behind Loxsyn at patreon.com/albasalix. And you can rate and review Loxsyn’s policy on iTunes by searching for “Other Bothers”.
Say no to the rule of Celene.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
(whispers)
Cheesecake.
MIK:
Say yes to Loxsyn.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Say yes to cheesecake.
MIK:
Paid for by the Committee to Elect Loxsyn.
THE CAF:
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh! That was amazing. Okay, so what happened next?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Well, I don’t think that I maybe hit the tree that hard, but you know… sure, I let Blat and Darcy take the lead on that one. So anyway, skipping ahead…
(whispers)
I’ll talk with you later about fixing some of this stuff.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh, okay…
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
So later on, we were being carried… It was a little uncomfortable, a little hot, but you know…
SEAN (AS RANDO)
What does it mean—like, you were “carried”. What do you mean, carried?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Oh, they came out and they had these chairs on poles that we sat down in…
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh, like kings.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes, because they respected us for being so brave and powerful.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Wow.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I thought they were going to eat us.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Well, yes because you’re confused, Blat, old friend.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
No… One ate my metal tube… and then I thought she was going to eat me. I was especially worried for poor Darvin. Oh… they were gonna eat Darvin.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes, and it would’ve been a sad loss to our party… But that wasn’t her day.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Her day?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Anyway, we moved along at a good clip and got to the temple. And that is where my oratory skills, that I am so well known for, really came out…
THE TEMPL:
SEAN (AS RANDO)
We are far above the forest, and we see a giant tree rising up in the distance. It is like a city coming out of the forest. It must be 250 feet tall, and flocks of birds in the thousands launch themselves off of sections and circle around and land in others.
And down, far beneath us, we see a group of Slaad, all robed, carrying a makeshift set of thrones on sticks, and riding on those, in the lead, is Eggerton. Next is Blat, and in the third is Darcy.
As they approach the clearing at the base of this giant tree, the Slaad all set down the sticks with the chairs on them and bow before the three adventurers.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I wish I’d known this is what they meant by putting us on poles. That wasn’t so bad.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I did think we were going to be tied to a pole and then placed over an open fire. You know, for eating.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, sure. Who wouldn’t have thought that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, absolutely.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I guess they just recognized how important I am, and decided to go through with it. Now, everyone stand back. I’m going to use a little bit of my PR charm to convince them to help us find Idries.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, please don’t.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’ve found so far that when it comes to the talky-talk you should be spending more time filling your gob with fairy cakes. Again, thank you very much for that fairy cake save from earlier… but I don’t know if this is the best idea.
SEA:
One of them raises from the supine position and says,
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
What can we do for you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Slaad! Thank you for bringing us to this majestic place on this noble quest of ours to find Idries. If you would please regale us with the lore you have learned of Idries so we can go forth and rescue all of time, it would be much appreciated. Thank you. You are now in awe.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, this is going to go well.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Idries is a false prophet!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The fourth prophet?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
False prophet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, the false prophet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s… Okay, so maybe we could speak with Idries the true prophet, her sister…
SEA:
They all look a little horrified.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh yeah, that’s… I, uh, so… yes, that is what I said. And I think maybe it would be best if Darcy…
MIK:
And I kind of start shuffling behind her—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…you were to take the lead in this case now. I have prepared the crowd for you. I’ve warmed them up and they’re all yours to go. And I’m going to be over here and… oh look! There are some flowers over there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thanks, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And I wander off to look at the flowers.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So, hey!
SEA:
One of them immediately stops you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh!
SEA:
Like, holds up one of their staffs, blocking your path.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay… I’ll stay here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Don’t touch the flowers.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They are particular about their geraniums.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Are you done insulting us?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no! We didn’t mean to insult you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Was it the geranium thing…?
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
The false prophet!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The false prophet, yes. We believe that Idries is a false prophet. Could we… speak to Idries anyway?
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Hmm. Why?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Darcy here… went to college with her!
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Yes. She may speak with the false prophet. Come with us.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that, my dear Eggerton, is how you orate.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So because we were roomies we get to go talk to her?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, who would turn down that particular request?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know, a group of robed amphibians who tried to eat your head off?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Who still appreciate that the friends that one has early in life are the most important.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Are you coming?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, let’s go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, we’re right behind you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh yes.
SEA:
Okay. So the Slaad warriors lead you forward, and there is a giant opening in this tree that must be 80, 90 feet tall and inside, the tree is not really hollow but carved out into a variety of passageways. It doesn’t look like it was ever carved by tools. It’s as if it was naturally formed this way.
And they’re leading you through a maze of corridors and then into a room that makes the quarters you’ve been traveling in look tiny. Most of the tree—it’s the heart chamber in the tree. And there are pews lining most of the back of the room where you’re entering from, and then it’s open, up to a giant altar.
And in front of the altar is standing what appears to be a woman in full plate mail, with the crest of the moon—the same crest that you see on the Slaad demon warriors that are escorting you in. But she is some distance away. This room is massive.
And there are a few people, Slaad, that are on the pews, and they they stop when you stop, the Slaad warriors that are escorting you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So… go say hi to your old friend.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So I start down the middle aisle towards…
SEA:
Okay. They separate and allow you to approach.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Tentatively, and as I reach the front of the room…
SEA:
That’s sort of the center, yeah, could be the front.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t really know how to approach this woman so I kind of sort of bow my head a little bit but in a really awkward way, like maybe sort of I’m being a supplicant but not doing it very well.
SEAN (AS THE WOMAN)
Who are you? What do you want?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you Idries?
SEA:
You sense a thousand bodies, it feels like, in this room, all stiffen, and weapons start to be drawn.
SEAN (AS THE WOMAN)
You might want to reword that question.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey…! So who are you?
SEAN (AS THE WOMAN)
Better. You may call me High Priestess.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. And this is your tree?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
It is now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hmm! And these are your… people?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
(a very slight laugh)
You mean my warriors?
SEA:
She smiles and looks out, and they all sort of relax a little.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes. These are the Wardens of the New Moon. We are returning this temple to its rightful beginnings.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ah. So… If there had been a wrongful beginning person here… just as a matter of interest, what would have happened to that obviously wrongful person?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
You’re speaking of the false prophet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Of course! The false prophet.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes. She is… being entertained.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Well that doesn’t sound so bad.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sure it’s bad, Blat.
SEA:
Oh! Are you approaching too?
CARTE:
Just sort of stuck my head in for a moment.
SEA:
The priestess literally reaches out and just pushes you to the side, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What—excuse me!
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
What have we here?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The story of my life.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello! Uh… we were just trying to talk to that false prophet! Heh. We’re from an organization that’s—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes yes yes, that’s enough.
SEA:
She’s scanning the room.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Who brought… Fath! Up here now.
SEA:
You see one of the demon Slaad scurrying forward.
SEAN (AS FATH)
Yes, High Priestess.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Who is this?
SEAN (AS FATH)
The Chosen One, Priestess.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Again, I don’t know what I’m chosen for.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Very good.
Yes. I’m sorry.
SEA:
And she turns back to you, Darcy.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
What can I help you with, darling?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So why so much interest in my friend Blat? He seems to really get a rise out of you and your compatriots here.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
He is demonborn, as we are.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ahh. Well then, Blat, old buddy… maybe you should come up here and do some of the talking! Really, Blat’s the one who needs the favor.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, excuse me, everyone…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is there a restroom in the tree? I had a bit of water earlier, and then there was a lot of running, and we were carried and it was a bouncy trail…
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
What is speaking right now?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I need to go and I don’t want to be rude but this is a tree—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
What is that?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I figured, you know, if you can’t find a restroom you can use a tree…
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Someone tell me what that sound is!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But we’re inside a tree and—what? What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Get up here!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello! I’m looking for a restroom…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Just look down.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh sorry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, not you. Her.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Just look down. That’s what that is.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
A fae in my temple with the Chosen One.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, yes. I’m just… you know, I can just pick a corner—I’m comfortable doing that. This is a tree. So that’s what we used to do, you know, when we couldn’t find a—
SEA:
She points to one of the Slaad.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
You! Take him. Take him to do his business.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent. Thanks so much!
MIK:
And I trot off.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Now. How can I help you? I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Darcy.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Darcy. Let me reintroduce myself. I am High Priestess Ithcar…
SEA:
And she bows quite formally.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
…at your service. I believe you were inquiring as to our false prophet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. We’re just interested to know what happened to her.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Well. We are looking for a new prophet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So are you holding auditions?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And how’s that going?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Not good.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I see. So you yourself do not consider yourself a prophet? Or a potential prophet?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
(growls)
Some of us are called to higher callings!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh. Okay.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
It’s not that we’re not worthy!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. So I’ve touched a nerve here. So hey, here’s a little question: Why does everyone keep calling Blat the Chosen One?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
I doubt he is the Chosen One.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, Blat. I doubt it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I never said I was the Chosen One!
My good woman. You’re looking for a new prophet and that’s all well and good. We’re in the market for an old one. So perhaps if you could just point us in the general direction where the old prophet was… banished to, we’ll get out of your tree, and I’ll remove the fairy from what he’s probably doing, which is messing up your restroom.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Very well.
SEA:
And she steps back, and as she steps back, the altar—it’s massive, and made out of wood—starts to pull back, exposing a beautiful set of ornate stairs that are going down.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
She is in the inner sanctum. You are welcome to visit her.
The false prophet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey guys! You have got to check the bathrooms in this place. It’s like these little notches in the tree—
SEA:
And that’s when one of the Slaad shoves Darcy.
MARIS:
(gasps)
SEA:
Darcy, roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
7.
SEA:
And Darcy goes stumbling down the stairs…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Aa! Aaaa!
SEA:
But manages to grab one thing as she falls. What do you grab?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I grab a tree root that’s coming through the staircase.
A rumbling of wood on wood.
SEA:
And so Darcy is left hanging halfway down the stairs, clinging to this branch, as the altar begins to close above her. She scrambles up the stairs, madly trying to reach the rest of the party… but the altar closes. And Darcy is left alone at the top of the stairs in the dark.

MARIS:
That’s hilarious.
MIK:
I was looking at my notes, I’m going, “Darvin? who the f—- is Darvin?”

(laughing)
I knew who it was immediately.

It was me! It was me!

I had no idea.

If I threw in the hint, “Darvin wore clothes that were too big for him!” Like… “Nope, got nothin’.”

SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
You must come to the temple.
SEA:
Blat, you recognize the Slaad as demon brethren.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
It is he! Meet Blat—the Chosen.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
If he’s the Chosen, why are you fighting him?
SEAN (AS FATH)
Because he won’t get on the pole.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Gooo Team Blat!
SEA:
Glytha charges you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
SEA:
The tree goes up in a big ball of flame. She bites right down on your shoulder.
CARTE:
Ohhh!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The sticks! We’ll travel by sticks!
SEA:
The Slaad all set down the sticks with the chairs on them and bow before the three adventurers.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Darcy. Let me reintroduce myself. I am High Priestess Ithcar…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And this is your tree?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
It is now.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes. These are the Wardens of the New Moon. We are returning this temple to its rightful beginnings.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ahh.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
We are looking for a new prophet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So are you holding auditions?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes.
SEA:
And that’s when one of the Slaad shoves Darcy.
MARIS:
(gasps)
SEA:
And Darcy goes stumbling down the stairs…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Aa! Aaaa!
SEA:
As the altar begins to close above her. And Darcy is left alone at the top of the stairs in the dark.
THE CAF:
SEA:
You feel the rumble… and the hiss. The spout dispenses what must be a bubbling acid… as the barista calmly finishes making the latte. The scent of cinnamon floating through the air, scones cooking… and a rather confused half-demon shouting at the corner table.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Scones! I’d like some more scones, please!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, Blat, you sit down and close your robe again please.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry. That keeps flapping open. Look! Wheeee!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, okay, stop…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wheeee!
SEAN (AS RANDO)
I didn’t know those things could flap like that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A‑hee-heeee!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s the half demon.
So you just… you tuck that back into its flap and close your robe, and I’ll go get you some scones. You sit here and talk with Rando about what happened next.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Okay, thanks Eggerton!
So Blat… what happened next? Like, Darcy was trapped under the altar.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Who?
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh, Darvin.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Darvin! Yes, yes, yes. Very frightening. The big altar just moved aside, and in tumbled Darvin.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So what happened after?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Darvin was trapped under the altar.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Right. Yeah.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I was not with Darvin, so I do not know what occurred.
A long silence.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I’m painting pictures with words.

Episode 11: Journey to the Temple, Part 4.
IN THE DAR:
SEA:
In the darkness under the altar, we hear a scurrying.
The players make scurrying noises.
SEA:
And then we hear Darcy stub her toe.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ow!
Blat! Eggerton! Can anybody hear me?
It’s… oh geez. Oh Loxsyn.
It’s so dark down here. What are the chances of that false prophet really being down here?
SEA:
So you can sort of sense a bit of air movement, but basically just the drip of water, and the stairs appear to go down in front of you and disappearing into absolute darkness. There’s just a tiny bit of light coming in through the cracks.
MARIS:
Okay, so I cast my rote spell Light.
Laughter.
SEA:
And you are standing on ornate stairs going down to a door that is open and there is a hallway. So it levels out where the doorway is, and then heads deeper under the tree from there. There’s nowhere but down the stairs. You are completely sealed, above you.
MARIS:
Okay so I head down the stairs.
SEA:
Okay.
MARIS:
And into the hallway, you say?
SEA:
You approach a door and yeah, there’s a hallway that stretches past the door, and as you enter there I assume the light travels with you.
MARIS:
Yes.
SEA:
So as you enter there, you see ahead of you a hallway that goes much farther than your light will reach.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
And it’s a pretty wide hallway and there are dead bodies. There’s a couple of dead bodies here, and there is a closed door to your left, not that far ahead, and there’s an open door to your right.
MARIS:
Okay, so I bend down and investigate one of these bodies. Can I discern how they’ve been killed or how long they’ve been dead?
SEA:
Okay, so you are going to Discern Realities. I don’t think we’ve done this before. So you’re going to roll 2d6 + Wisdom.
MARIS:
It’s an 8.
So basically, how Discern Realities normally would work is, you’d have to ask me from this list of questions, but basically you can ask me one question.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
So I’ll tell you what you see. You see a younger woman wearing what appear to have been off-white-coloured robes so sort of like an acolyte or what you might see in a lot of temples. And the hair sort of tied back, so not hanging down loose. And she’s been stabbed through the back, is what it looks like right now.
MARIS:
Is there any symbol on her robe?
SEA:
There is. You almost don’t see it in the stains and the blood. But as you go to move her slightly, you catch a very ornate—it’s almost hard to tell at first, but it looks like it might be a number 7.
MARIS:
All right. So I continue along the passage, and you say there is a door to my right that’s open?
SEA:
There’s a door on your right that’s open, and there’s a door that’s closed on your left, across from each other.
MARIS:
Okay, so I look through. I peer around the open door to see if I can catch a glimpse of anything.
SEA:
Okay. You see, as your light comes around the corner, it fills up—you can’t see all the room. You can see a bit of it. There appear to be two cots that you can see, and two little chests in front of the cots and they’re almost identical. They’ve both been made up.
MARIS:
Okay. So I go into the room, and I see if I can open one of the chests.
SEA:
Sure. As you come into the room the light fills it, and you see there are four cots, a couple of which have been torn apart as if someone was searching for something, and the other two are made up.
And yes, you can open the chest. You open the chest and you see what appears to be an extra robe.
MARIS:
And these robes are white as well, right?
SEA:
Yes, same—looks like the same colour as the dead body outside.
MARIS:
Okay. And there’s nothing else of interest in the room.
SEA:
Not that you see.
MARIS:
Okay. I leave the room.
SEA:
You do hear at this point a sound, but you’re not sure where it was coming from. It sounds like in the hall.
MARIS:
Okay. So I tentatively peek back out into the hall. Can I see anything?
SEA:
No.
MARIS:
Okay. So I step back out into the hall and I proceed—well, you said the door was right across, actually.
SEA:
Yep.
MARIS:
So I put my ear to the closed door. And can I hear anything?
SEA:
Yeah, you don’t you don’t hear anything. But you do hear that sound again from down the hall as if something was moving, but it sounds far away. It’s hard to tell, because it’s very echoey.
MARIS:
Okay. So I try the doorknob of this closed door.
SEA:
It turns.
MARIS:
Oh, so I open the door tentatively and peer in.
SEA:
You see another dead body, this one horribly bloodied, and wearing a similar robe.
This room is a little smaller than the other room and it has one cot and one chest at the foot that looks identical to the other room. But then it has a writing desk, and a couple other chests.
MARIS:
So I go to the writing desk and I see if I can see anything on the surface.
SEA:
You do see something on the surface.
MARIS:
Oooo. It’s a pen.
SEA:
There would be a pen. Now the ink jar has been spilled over, and you find… this.
MARIS:
I’m being passed a very crumpled, aged letter, and it says:
To our Most Revered Mother Speckley,
We grow more worried by the day, as the Blessed Oracle has grown more and more distant. She will not eat nor speak nor even move.
Something stirs in the forests. There is a silence that is not natural. We all feel that we are being watched. The time comes that was foretold. That is all we know. It is the last words the Blessed Oracle spoke.
So many of us have forgotten our vows in these times of peace, lost in the mindless tasks of maintaining a forgotten temple. I will send this letter in the morning with our fastest rider. I pray these are simply the words of a frightened old woman and we will one day soon raise glasses of tea and laugh over this message.
And the signature is barely begun, as if abruptly halted mid-stroke.
(lowers her voice to a whisper)
And of course this letter has not been sent.
Okaaay!
So I hold onto the letter as—are there any drawers or anything in the writing desk?
SEA:
There is a drawer.
MARIS:
Okay. So I open that drawer.
SEA:
You find wax and a seal.
MARIS:
Okay. And that wax appears to be what was attempted to be used on this letter?
SEA:
This letter wasn’t even sealed.
MARIS:
Okay. And you said there were other chests.
SEA:
Yes.
MARIS:
So can I check one of those chests?
SEA:
It is locked.
MARIS:
Ahhh. And all these extra chests are locked.
SEA:
No, the other chest is open, and it’s basically got linens and cloths and a couple of the same book. It’s like some kind of religious text.
MARIS:
So I pull the book out and I open it. Can I understand what’s in it?
SEA:
Yep. It’s it’s written in common language, and it’s like psalms.
MARIS:
Okay. And does it have the number 7 on it?
SEA:
It does have the number 7 on the cover.
MARIS:
All right. So I put the letter in my satchel.
SEA:
Okay.
And you hear that noise again, a little louder in the hall.
MARIS:
Right. So now can I discern—is it like a shuffling…?
SEA:
Yes.
MARIS:
Eeee. This letter says “Something stirs in the forests.”
Okay, so I inch along the hallway.
SEA:
So going back into the hall.
MARIS:
Yes, back into the hall and towards this sound, because backwards is to the staircase.
SEA:
So that’s when, out of the darkness… you hear a voice.
THE CAF:
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Okay Blat, I got you some more scones here. Now don’t try and heat these ones up yourself.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh no, Eggerton, this is—you just interrupted [something] amazing! He was just telling me about how he basically was going to become the next prophet!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Well…
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Which I thought you told me that you were the next prophet! So it’s like… I’m really fascinated to see how that came about, and then how you became the prophet. So this would be a perfect time for you to join us.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Oh yeah, okay. So maybe Blat’s a little confused. I mean, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but he’s got a little older and he’s not entirely there all the time…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Scone time!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yep. Here you go, buddy. Here it is.
Blat begins wolfing down a scone.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Okay. Yeah, let me just wipe some of those crumbs off your robe for you. There you go.
Yes, thank you ma’am.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So he just got done telling me that he basically offered to be the next prophet—
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Hold on. I need to put all of these sugars in my coffee. This might take a minute.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Okay, Blat, maybe you can pick up where you left off, where she accepted you to become the next prophet.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Yes. Because I too was demonic, and I said, “I don’t like what you did to Darvin, locking poor Darvin in the basement.” And they felt bad about that and said, “You’re right! We don’t know what we’re doing. You should be the new prophet.” And to this, I said, “Aha, of course!” And there was much dancing and rejoicing.
MEANWHILE, UPSTAIR:
SEA:
Inside the temple, Blat approaches High Priestess Ithcar.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The altar swallowed up my dear friend Darcy! What… what’s happening here?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think the tree was hungry.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
I thought it was very obvious. The altar swallowed up your friend Darcy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But why?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m sure she’s going to be okay. Darcy always perseveres.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
You are the one we are interested in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that’s very nice of you to say. I’ve always thought there was something a little more special about me than the others. But no one ever really wants—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Someone take that thing to the bathroom again.
SEA:
And a Slaad grabs you by the back and start dragging you back towards…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t need to go—okayyy.
I’ll be back…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Listen, people have been referring to me as the “Chosen One” all day, and then kicking my ass anyway. This is a very strange group. We’re just here to see… the fallen prophet, the false prophet, however you want to say it.
We’re not interested in your group. I just want to make sure that my friend is okay and that my other friend is not being assaulted in the bathroom.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Have you had any… visions lately?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Visions. Well let’s see what did I see?
I saw a member of the Slaad spit venom on me. Then I saw her… eat a metal tube…
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Really!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And then, yes, stairs swallowed up my friend…
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
(sighs in disgust)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And then another Slaad took my friend away. I’m not interested in your group. We just want to get out of here and find this, whozamacallit, Idris.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Fine. Very funny. Just touch the altar.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Touch the altar…
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
This altar here. Just…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, just touch the thing that swallowed up my friend.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m sure nothing bad’s going to happen if I should touch the altar. Here!
SEA:
Blat reaches forward and places his finger on the altar.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Look! I’ve touched your—
Ominous orchestral music blares.
SEA:
—and you are swallowed into the blackness.
MARIS:
(laughs)
Oh no.
SEA:
Everything disappears. The world is exploding. And you find yourself rushing forward.
And you are suddenly standing beside Eggerton, beside Darcy. You are all covered in goop. You are slashed but you are alive and you are victorious! And you are standing on a pile of zombie bodies. And one hand starts to reach up and you just slam down with your bazooka and smash it. And you are looking out over a field that is blue. There’s a blue sun, a blue shining across this field where the tide has turned and humanity has won.
The music turns more solemn.
SEA:
And then you are zipping backwards, flying through, and you are standing in a dark chapel and you see two broken bodies.
You see Eggerton’s body, lifeless, lying there, blood seeping out. And his hand has reached out towards Darcy who is also lying in a pool of blood, her body ripped apart. And then you turn… and you actually see yourself standing over them. And your other self turns to look at you and you have no eyes. The sockets are empty.
And then you are back suddenly, standing in the chapel, looking at High Priestess Ithcar, who is watching you very closely.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I didn’t care for that at all!
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Care for what?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What I just saw!
SEA:
All of the Slaad in the room drop down to their knees and lay prone on the ground and start going,
SEAN (AS THE SLAAD)
Whooom, whooom, whooom! The Chosen! Whooom, whooom, whooom!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, stop it. We’ve seen this whole act before it, and it doesn’t mean that nothing bad’s going to happen to us. Where’s…
(snapping his fingers)
Where’s the one who spat venom on me?
SEA:
One of them sort of looks around at the other Slaad, and then stands up awkwardly and starts coming forward.
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
That… that would be me, Chosen One!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Enough of this Chosen One nonsense. If you truly believe that I’m someone special, why the fighting? Why the acid spitting? Why the kneeling down with our hands behind our head? Why?
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
(stammers uncertainly)
SEA:
Glytha sort of looks at you, and looks at the Priestess, and looks at you and just is shaking.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If I’m truly someone special, why am I being separated from my friends. Why?!
SEA:
She just looks at Ithcar and looks at you and starts trembling more.
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
…I’m so sorry!
SEA:
And the Priestess is sort of chuckling and leans over toward you.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
(whispers)
It’s best to ask simple questions of the Slaad.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
How much simpler could I be?
(sighs)
All right, back with the crowd.
SEA:
Glytha scurries back. She looks much relieved.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Now if you would come with me, Prophet.
SEA:
Cutting over to Eggerton… you are being dragged back to the place you already peed, and all of a sudden a Slaad with you, even though you’re out of earshot, just lets go of you and drops prone to the ground. And you are released.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! I’ve been trying to tell you I don’t need to pee again. Thank you for listening. Uh, I’m going to head on back and see what Blat is up to. So thanks very much for the lift… and I’ll see you soon.
MIK:
And I wander back from whence I came.
SEA:
Okay. So you wander into the large chamber and you notice all the Slaad are just down, prone on the floor, and they’re listening as Blat and the High Priestess speak quietly at the altar.
MIK:
I am going to try and quietly approach.
SEA:
So… I don’t think you’re in any danger, so yeah, you quietly approach.
MIK:
All right so I’m going to walk up you know in between the rows…
SEA:
They’re all ignoring you.
MIK:
And sort of duck down and go,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wumpa wumpa.
SEA:
(laughs)
Kay.
MIK:
And then wait a second, walk a few more rows up and go,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wumpa.
SEAN (AS THE SLAAD)
Wumpa, wumpa, wumpa. Chosen One.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wumpa. Chosen One… One who is chosen.
MIK:
And walk a few more steps.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wumpa. Wumpa wumpa?
MIK:
And then walk up so I’m in the front row.
SEA:
Okay. So now you can hear what’s going on with Ithcar and Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So now I’m the prophet. I don’t—how can I be the prophet? I don’t know anything about your group. We just met you a few hours ago.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
It is not my place to speak for Morrigu, the Ancient One.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, of course not! Who can speak for Morrigu? Morrigu is so mysterious—I don’t know who Morrigu is.
I… all right. How about this: So I’m the new prophet? Well, I then say that Morrigu has beamed a message into my brain that says—
SEA:
And you swallowed by the blackness.
MARIS:
(laughs)
An otherworldly rumbling sound. Blat’s distorted voice echoes, speaking in an unknown language.
You come back into the room, and the High Priestess car has now dropped prone and is shaking, and everyone is shaking… and Eggerton is looking at you with very wide eyes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uhhhhhh…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, that happened before—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
The Prophet has spoken! His words are of Morrigu and true!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I, um…
DARC:
SEA:
And we cut to deep down into the darkness.
And Darcy, you hear a voice, and it sounds like one of the Slaad. And you start to just see something in the light, just at the edge of the light approaching you.
Tense music begins.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
I am to battle you, little one.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… why? Sorry, why am I battling anyone? I’m not a Chosen One or anything.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
State your own name for a battle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I can say my name—I’d rather not be in battle though. It’s Darcy? I’m Darcy Kimble. I just want to go back up to my friends, up the stairs?
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Darcy. Battle accepted.
I am Waffles.
Laughter.
The music grinds to a halt.
CARTE:
Okay, flag on the play.
Laughter.
CARTE:
If you want to maintain mood, his name can’t be Waffles.
MARIS:
(laughing)
Yeah! He can’t be Waffles!
SEA:
(in a Slaad voice)
Sorry, I did not make up the names. I asked Eli for the names. He gave me Waffles.
MARIS:
No! You’re going to ruin Darcy’s moment! Now pass me tissues. I spat all over myself.
CARTE:
How about Wafla?
SEA:
Waffles.
MIK:
Wafla?
CARTE:
Wafla.
The music resumes.
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
Waffles is the name.
SEA:
And starts taking the robe off. Long, red claws, you see gleaming, as Waffles steps into the light.
MARIS:
So my light goes out. I let my light go out, and I run back towards the staircase and I run up as far as I can. I’m just pushing against the altar bottom.
SEA:
You hear,
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
(sinister chuckle)
SEA:
And you feel something chasing you through the darkness.
MARIS:
(anxious groan)
SEA:
And you hear—the feet are pounding, but you hear this tap as the nails also hit the ground, the claws. So you’re going to roll Defy Danger as you’re running for the end, I assume screaming.
MARIS:
Waaah!
(rolling the dice)
And weeping a little bit.
11!
SEA:
Okay, you feel something swipe past you and then hit the doorjamb and bounce back into the hall.
MARIS:
Oh, because there’s a door up to the staircase.
SEA:
Yeah. So you come right through the door and up the stairs, scrambling up. You see faint lines of light leaking in. You’re scratching at them and you hear something standing up behind you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(in a panic)
Open the altar, open the altar, open the altar! Help! Help!
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
This will be my day.
SEA:
And something leaps towards you. Roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
Oh geez. I can’t roll 11 twice in a row…
SEA:
Maybe you can.
MARIS:
It’s a 7.
SEA:
Do you have any pluses on Strength or Dex?
MARIS:
Dex, I think I have a plus on. I have a +1 on Dex. So it’s an 8.
SEA:
So it’s a partial success.
You just manage to turn, but one of the claws catches you on the side of your shoulder and spins you around further, so you are actually going to fall away, like back down towards the door and scrambling backwards.
MARIS:
Okay
SEA:
But you’re going to take 5 hit points of damage as one of the claws scrapes right along your shoulder.
MARIS:
Oo, wow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Aaah! Aaa!
MARIS:
So of course I’m now on the other side of him, so I run back down the hallway.
SEA:
Down the hall. Okay.
He laughs and tears after you… and you can sense that he runs faster than you.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
And you’re going to have to roll Defy Danger again as he’s on your heels.
MARIS:
That’s a 5.
SEA:
You feel a claw go right through your right shoulder—and if there was a light you’d see it come out and then pull back. And it spins you around, and you drop to your knees. And you sense this very large demon body just right in front of you as he laughs…
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
Ha ha!
SEA:
…and raises a claw to give you the killing blow.
The music has become a ’70s action-movie soundtrack. It begins to build to a crescendo.
MARIS:
Okay, so I feel this terror take over, and with the pain that’s just gone through my shoulder also this rage is starting to rise within me. And my hair starts to stand on end and my eyes start glowing—and this Slaad can see them now in the dark, as they glow through the dark. And my body starts to get bigger and push up against the creature that’s bending down over me. And as I’m pushing up these huge spikes are coming out of my back and I’m just going,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hurrrgh! Raaaargh!
MARIS:
And suddenly I’m as big if not slightly bigger than this Slaad. And what is standing in front of him is this huge glowing-eyed werecupine… which is a were-porcupine.
SEA:
He is stumbling backwards, just in shock—you take another 5 hit points, by the way. You were at full coming in here…
MARIS:
Just so you know I’m now at 2.
SEA:
I know.
MARIS:
So let’s not kill Darcy off.
(laughs)
SEA:
Wait for it…
He literally stumbles back, like—
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
What… what is this? What are you?!
SEA:
And he’s sort of he doesn’t know what to do. So it is your advantage to do what you will Darcy.
MARIS:
Well, I have a few things that happen here when I have my Curse of the Were-Morph.
SEA:
Okay, let’s work through them.
MARIS:
Okay, I have the tags Close. I don’t actually know—but I have Armor 2. So now I gain 2 Armor.
SEA:
Okay, so I’ll say the armor worked on that last blow, just so you—that subtracts 2, so you only got 3. So you’re at minus 8. Yeah, so you’re at 4 hit points.
MARIS:
Okay, 4 hit points…
SEA:
So Armor 2 is something you have to remember. That means that if you take damage more than 2 that’s not called Piercing, and even there we have to look at it, it means you subtract 2 from incoming damage.
MARIS:
Okay. When I take damage, I gain 1 Rage, just so you know, so I guess that would have been a Rage.
SEA:
Okay. That would have been a Rage.
MARIS:
+1…
SEA:
Okay, so you start with a Rage of 2 when you become enraged…
MARIS:
And when—if—I make a 10+ (ha ha) successful attack, I overwhelm my enemy with a flurry of attacks and they’re going to take some some issues.
SEA:
Right. And I think we’re also going to be changing your attack die, right? d12?
MARIS:
d12! Boom!
SEA:
Oh, and on here, there is a Rage meter.
MARIS:
Ooo, a Rage meter!
(laughs)
SEA:
So you’re technically at 3.
MARIS:
We need the noise for that. Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!
SEA:
Beep-beep-beep-beep!
MARIS:
Rage meter.
SEA:
So what does giant werecupine Darcy do to this cowering Slaad that’s slowly stumbling backwards with glistening claws that are covered in your blood?
MARIS:
Well, first of all, your depiction of—Glytha, is it?—in the earlier scene made me very sympathetic to the Slaad. You made me feel very sorry for her, so…
But this is not Darcy. This is werecupine!
SEA:
(laughs)
MARIS:
So since I’m coming up with my back to the Slaad, I then stand up straight and as I arc back a little bit, these spikes come shooting out of the back of me, right into the Slaad. And I don’t know where they get him because I’m not looking, but I imagine they get them somewhere soft and gooey.
SEA:
Well, let’s find out. Roll 2d6 to Hack and Slash.
MARIS:
7.
SEA:
Okay, so I’d say that’s a partial success. So what’s going to happen is—it’s sort of your first time in a while in this form? You don’t judge the size of the hallway and you sort of come off-kilter a little…
MARIS:
Sure.
SEA:
And fall backward.
MARIS:
Like a turtle.
SEA:
Like a turtle, you’re gonna fall back on your back—but you’re going to do damage. So that is a d12 that you’re going to roll.
MARIS:
It’s a 10! It’s a 10!
Thok-thok-thok-thok!
SEA:
You hear a horrible crunching sound…
MARIS:
Awwww…
SEA:
And as you land on your back… two giant porcupine quills stuck in his chest, you see a light start to fill the hall, this red light. And you see as the Slaad is just consumed by this fire that’s roaring up from his feet, all the way up. And he looks a little surprised, and then he looks at you and goes,
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
Bye-bye.
MARIS:
(laughs ruefully)
Awww!
SEA:
And waves, and foof! He’s gone in a flash of smoke.
MIDROL:
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey everyone. Sean here.
I am super excited to tell you about one of my new favorite podcasts ever, and it is 20-Sided Stories. It is an improvised roleplaying podcast where there’s a rotating cast of comedians, artists, performers, nerds and what-have-you. They’re playing a tabletop RPG, but this is a little different. This is a show after our own hearts here at The End Of Time. They are combining improv, great stories and roleplaying zaniness, and characters, with music and sound design to create a must-hear podcast—and they just started a Pokémon series. Come on people—Pokémon roleplay live play. We are so in for this.

MUSIC STIN:
SEAN (AS FATHER)
Hey Timmy! Hey, Timmy, I’m home!
CARTER (AS TIMMY)
(a little kid)
Hello? Are you home finally?
SEAN (AS FATHER)
Hey hey! Sorry, it was a long day at work, but you know what? I stopped at that new comic book shop on the way home.
CARTER (AS TIMMY)
(gasps)
No you did not! Did you get the thing that I really wanted? The thing that I wanted more than anything else?
SEAN (AS FATHER)
I hope so.
CARTER (AS TIMMY)
The thing that I never thought would ever be published ever ever ever ever in the known universe?!
SEAN (AS FATHER)
I hope so! It’s so hard—I get them so mixed up. You wanted The End Of…
CARTER (AS TIMMY)
Time and Other Bothers?!
SEAN (AS FATHER)
Yes! It’s the Bizarro version!
CARTER (AS TIMMY)
Ohh, the Bizarro variant! It’s a double-sized variant issue. Oh! What will the characters of this show be like as their complete opposites?
MARISA (AS BIZARRO DARCY)
(singing, in the manner of a Disney princess)
It’s morning, it’s morning, it’s morning!
Hello, fellow adventurers! As I whip open all the curtains and let the sunlight stream in.
Wake up, wake up, wake up, Blat! Wake up, Eggerton! It’s a beautiful morning!
CARTER (AS BIZARRO BLAT)
(a lecherous drawl)
It is most certainly beautiful, but not quite as beautiful as the thing that I’m seeing right in front of me. Ohhh yeah.
MARISA (AS BIZARRO DARCY)
Are you drinking beer again, Blat?
CARTER (AS BIZARRO BLAT)
I am indeed, but that doesn’t mean that I can’t drink in a little something else, which is the sight of you. I’m willing to be back in time if I can be back in time with your pretty little butt.
MARISA (AS BIZARRO DARCY)
(chiding cheerfully)
Naughty, naughty, naughty! Not today!
CARTER (AS BIZARRO BLAT)
Mmm mmm.
SEAN (AS BIZARRO SNEGAL)
What are you doing looking at her?! I’m here in bed with you!
CARTER (AS BIZARRO BLAT)
No… Snegal—
SEAN (AS BIZARRO SNEGAL)
Don’t you “Oh, Snegal” me! Darcy, he’s allll yours. I’m out!
CARTER (AS BIZARRO BLAT)
Aww.
MIKE (AS BIZARRO EGGERTON)
(growls)
This is why I need my own room. The bunch of you people just talk so much.
MARISA (AS BIZARRO DARCY)
But Eggerton, I made fresh pancakes!
MIKE (AS BIZARRO EGGERTON)
Do I look like someone who likes food?
MARISA (AS BIZARRO DARCY)
Everyone looks like someone who likes food!
MIKE (AS BIZARRO EGGERTON)
Oh my God.
All right. This is how it’s going to be.
You go do your thing.
MARISA (AS BIZARRO DARCY)
I am doing my thing. I’m serving pancakes.
MIKE (AS BIZARRO EGGERTON)
You missed the part where I said “go”.
MARISA (AS BIZARRO DARCY)
(sighs)
SEAN (AS BIZARRO CYRUS)
Hi everyone! It’s Cyrus! Ha ha!
Oh, here’s your briefings. I’ll hand them out. Darcy… I got a special one for you.
MARISA (AS BIZARRO DARCY)
Thank you!
SEAN (AS BIZARRO CYRUS)
Eggerton. Man, this is going to be good. I got a good one for you. Heh heh! Here’s your briefing. Heh! You gotta… you gotta… I’ll just leave it right here next to your—
MIKE (AS BIZARRO EGGERTON)
Could you do that in two words or less?
SEAN (AS BIZARRO CYRUS)
Ha ha ha! You’re a kidder! Have a good mission, guys!
MIKE (AS THE BIZARRO SHATTERING)
Hi guys! It’s me, the Shattering! I just want to remind you that we are all going to patreon.com/albasalix tonight! Where we’re going to support our friends and family and make everyone’s dreams come true, and make sure that time continues forever and ever and ever!
I’m the Shattering! Thanks for coming! Hashtag #otherbothers!

THE CAF:
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Yes, so after he gave the prophecy of… Morrigar? Mora…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Morrigu.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Morrigu.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Morrigu, yup.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Morrigu. I saw terrible visions where I was standing in front of Eggerton and Darvin’s bodies. Poor Darvin had been cleaved in two. And that’s what I knew: I shouldn’t do that. And I swore I never would.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I never did kill you, did I Eggerton?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Well, you… We’ll talk about that later.
As I remember it, Blat’s eyes kind of went dark, and he said something like “MORRIGU WILL DESTROY ALL.”
Silence.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Nope, don’t remember that at all.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So how did you guys get out of the temple?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
So that’s when I pulled my trusty sword from its scabbard, that I had not told anyone about up until this point. And I said “Release my friend, Morrigu!”
THE TEMPL:
SEA:
We cut back to the temple.
Blat is staring at a sea of quaking Slaad, and the Priestess, and Eggerton looking at him as if you just stole his fairy pouch again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, Blat, Blat, hey Blat, I have a couple questions for you buddy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sure.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So, when did you learn to talk like that? Because it was kind of creepy, I mean I know we joked about about being ventriloquists a while ago, but that was going a little too far, I think it really kind of ruined the mood here, and…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Could you perhaps, um… I just sort of blacked out there for a second. Could you perhaps repeat what just happened?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes—
SEA:
And right then you hear a pounding on the stones…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(from under the altar)
Help! Help! Somebody help me!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that sounds like Darcy. We should probably go take care of that right now.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. All right. Someone, for heaven’s sake, move the altar. Get my friend out of the tree basement.
SEA:
The Priestess looks up, but is staying prone and says,
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
It is your will. You are Morrigu’s voice. You are the next prophet. You must simply use your power.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The power of moving a chair?
All right. All right. Eggerton, get up here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If we put our shoulders against this thing, maybe we can move it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right.
MIK:
So I lean forward and put my shoulder up against it, and start scrabbling my feet, trying to push.
SEA:
Yeah, you guys are both scrabbling your feet on the smooth wooden floor.
Eggerton and Blat grunt and strain mightily, to no avail.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Okay. Blat, I think maybe that you should use your newly-found prophesizing to tell all of the Slaad to help us. Or maybe, you know, do you have powers? Did you get powers?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know! I don’t know what this Morrigu nonsense is. I just have some… weird visions in my head that I’d rather not discuss.
All right. All right. Venom girl!
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
Yes, Prophet?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Get up here and tell us how to move this chair.
SEAN (AS GLYTHA)
Uh…
SEA:
She just starts shaking.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
Enough with the shaking. Everyone here is either stupid or evasive.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! I’ve got an idea. I’ve got an idea. Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, here’s what we’re going to do. You, think about moving the altar. Okay? Think about it. Are you thinking about it?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I thought that’s what I was thinking about.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Think about it. Close your eyes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. I’m closing my eyes. I’m thinking about it. Move the altar. Move the altar.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Think about it. Thiiink about it. Think about it.
MIK:
And I slap Blat across the face.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Augh!
Why did you do that in front of the Slaad?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I didn’t do it in front of the Slaad… but I thought, you know, if you were thinking about it and then you got really angry, that would be the burst you need to make it move.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I see. So you think what would happen is, if one of us would get outrageously angry, that some amazing thing would happen that would then solve a very dire problem that we were in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, exactly! I think that is a very clear solution we should be exploring.
SEA:
You guys hear a roar…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(a strange hissing sound)
SEA:
…from down underneath you, muffled.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See? It’s starting to work.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Starting to work…? It sounds like an old dishwasher! I don’t know what you are talking about.
Listen, could someone please… Priestess!
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Please, just help us move this altar. We need to get to our friend.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Very well. You’d like my help?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fine. The magic words. Yes, please, I need your help. Help us get to our friend!
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Sure. First, though…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There’s always a “first”. You see, Eggerton? There’s always a “first” for these people.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
We can’t move the altar. Only you can. But I can help you be able to move it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…Well. This doesn’t sound like it’s going to end badly for me at all. Fine!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I… actually, I think it might end badly for you, that’s what it sounds like to me—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Slaad. Kill the little one.
MARIS:
(gasps)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
MIK:
And I look around.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
The Slaad are all talking:
SEAN (AS VARIOUS SLAAD)
Do you want to do it?
No, I did the last one.
I’ll do it!
Okay. We’ve decided that Lazbo will fight the little one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The little… who’s the little one? I don’t… The Slaad all look roughly the same size to me.
SEA:
One of the Slaad stands up and search removing their robes. The giant arms hanging down, and the claws…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so… where’s the little one?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, Eggerton, get behind me. Get behind me, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. All right. Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Lazbo!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(hisses)
Yes, Prophet?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
The bazooka starts to appear, but something’s wrong. The ground rumbles.
SEA:
And that is when, Darcy, you feel the tree move. There is a roar of lightning coming down from the heavens that strikes the tree and sends everybody flying back from the dais, including Eggerton and Blat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaa!
SEA:
Lightning races down over all the wood and strikes in at Blat and almost—you can see the bazooka half-forming and then half-unforming and the lightning is dancing around the room. And then there is an explosion that sends everyone flying hundreds of feet towards the wall of the heart chamber. And you hear a horrific sound as one of the giant limbs tears off the tree, and then hits the ground, sending a shockwave back towards the room you’re in.
And then it’s all quiet.
And the Priestess stands up and brushes herself off.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
There, Prophet! You are close. But a few more and you will have the power of Morrigu. And then you’ll have all you’ve ever wanted.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(weakly)
I don’t need…
Ugh, excuse me. Pardon me. I’m sorry.
I do not need the power of Morrigu. I’m perfectly happy with the power of bazoo—okay, we’re not going to say that again…
SEA:
(laughing)
They all look up, hopeful.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, no, no.
Eggerton, are you all right?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m okay over here! I landed on a couple of…
SEAN (AS SOME SLAAD)
It’s okay, we got you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We landed on a couple of the Slaad. They broke my fall.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. I don’t know.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Wait! Am I supposed to still fight the little one?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No! You’re not supposed to fight me any more. The lightning, the tree, everything—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes, Slaad, you are.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, okay—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Kill the little one.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, don’t make me say the word again… Bad things happen when I say the word.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ll say it! Bazooka! Bazooka! Come on, bazooka! Bazooooka!
SEA:
Nothing’s happening, but you see a Slaad starting to move towards you slowly, stalking like a cat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t like that. I don’t like it. Bazooka! Bazooka! Blat! Hey, Blat…
SEA:
And the Slaad launches herself at you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaa!
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger, Eggerton.
MARIS:
(laughing)
Oh gosh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s a 9.
MARIS:
Wow.
SEA:
So you scramble backwards, and manage to not get devoured by this demon. But you do slam your head back, tripping over, so you hit the hard floor for 1 hit point of damage.
And the Slaad is turned, and is hissing—Chthhhh!—and is still advancing on you. What do you do?
The other Slaad are backing away, trying to get out of the way, forming a circle like a fight at high school.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat! I don’t want to fight him, Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t want you to fight him either, you silly little fairy cake.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Just call your power, Prophet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat, If you call… I don’t know, though, because then we might explode again and I didn’t like exploding but I also don’t want to fight him, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know what else to do. I don’t know what else to…
(whining)
Oh, I don’t wanna be a Prophet of Morrigu. Don’t make me be a Prophet of Morrigu…
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
It’s very simple.
SEA:
And the Slaad is going to attack you! What are you doing?
MIK:
Uh, I’m going to run and duck under him as he jumps.
SEA:
Okay! Roll Defy Danger.
MIK:
It’s a 9!
SEA:
Okay, so you run at the Slaad, who looks a little confused, and swipes at you and catches you on the side as you slide under and through. But then the Slaad is looking through her legs and sort of half falls over. So you take you take… ooo, 4 hit points of damage.
MARIS:
Oooo.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t wanna fight, Blat! Blat, please don’t make me fight!
SEA:
And we cut back to underneath, in the darkness, the werecupine. And you just felt the entire tree shake and be ripped half apart, and dust is falling down.
But you don’t hear any other—well, you hear the sounds of some kind of something going on upstairs.
MARIS:
I’m still on my back, so I’m rocking back and forth to try and get up.
SEA:
I say you manage to get up.
MARIS:
All right.
SEA:
With a roar. Give me a roar.
MARIS:
(laughing)
Well, remember, everyone, porcupines don’t really roar. So that’s why I sound like an old dishwasher.
SEA:
Wait, what does a porcupine sound like?
MARIS:
(a strange, gutteral chittering)
SEA:
Okay. So you’re back up…
MIK:
(laughing)
You looked so red in the face when you did that.
MARIS:
Okay, so I’m up!
SEA:
And you suddenly notice smells…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sniffs alertly)
SEA:
Like, it happens when you’ve done this in the past. Right? It’s this beautiful ability to smell in a way that you’re not able to smell as a human. And you don’t smell any other demons near you.
MARIS:
But I smell a lot of death because of all the dead bodies around!
SEA:
Yes. You do smell a lot of rotting flesh.
MARIS:
Yes. So I run to the end of the hallway, away from the stairs. Do I come to anything of interest?
SEA:
Yes. You enter a large chamber, not quite as large as the upstairs chapel, but there is a beam of light coming down and hitting basically a round, wooden, perfectly smooth, glistening like marble, circular dais in the centre.
MARIS:
So I approach the dais and I… is there anything for me to touch or a button or…?
SEA:
It just looks like a smooth glass dais.
MARIS:
Um… Is there anything else in the room?
SEA:
There is a… as you look around, there is one door, far in the far wall, and that’s it.
MARIS:
Okay, so I run to the door in the far wall, and I throw my weight against it to try and open it.
SEA:
Okay. It takes a couple hits and then it just bursts in, wood flying everywhere.
MARIS:
Okay. And what’s in the room?
SEA:
Stairs going up.
MARIS:
(gasps)
Stairs!
So I scramble up the stairs as quickly as I can.
SEA:
Okay, you come to the top and there’s a door. And you now… the commotion, you hear shouting and “I don’t want to die!” and hissing and you hear Blat screaming, “I don’t want to be Morrigu’s prophet!”
And there’s a door in front of you.
MARIS:
Okay, so I again throw my weight at the door and burst through.
SEA:
Okay, after a couple times times it explodes outwards. A couple Slaad are laying prostrate on the ground, and they glance at you, but then go back to
SEAN (AS SOME SLAAD)
Whoom whoom whoom! Prophet! Whoom whoom whoom! Prophet!
SEA:
And then there’s a hall you’re in, there’s a door straight across from you, and that’s where you can hear the sounds of battle.
MARIS:
Okay. So I keep scrambling towards that door, towards the battle sounds.
SEA:
The giant werecupine… as you go to touch the door…
MARIS:
Yes.
The grinding bass note of the Shattering.
SEA:
Blackness overtakes you.
MARIS:
Ah, great.
SEA:
And you know—you’ve done this a couple of times now, and this time it’s a little different. You’re suddenly present. You know what’s happening and you’re suddenly forward into the darkness and there is a form there, somewhat humanoid… and it’s just looking at you with what might be eyes? It’s all just sort of murky. It’s black, in the blackness but you can sense there’s some type of sentience there.
MARIS:
And so this is just a vision I’m having?
SEA:
You can’t tell if it’s real or it’s a vision or if you’ve been teleported.
MARIS:
Okay. So can I approach the figure?
SEA:
Sure. You’re just, you’re not sure! You’re just in blackness and you see this figure not that far away. Do you want to try?
MARIS:
Sure. And what form am I in? Am I still a werecupine?
SEA:
Yep.
MARIS:
Okay. So I approach this figure.
SEA:
You’re not able to move, but then all of a sudden, as you think of it, you start suddenly getting closer as you think of it. So now you’re like, a few feet away.
MARIS:
Okay. So I look up—you said the figure is humanoid.
SEA:
Yes.
MARIS:
Actually, I’m pretty big, so I might be eye to eye, anyway.
SEA:
Yeah.
MARIS:
And I go,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(chattering porcupine noises)
SEA:
What is Darcy’s deepest desire?
MARIS:
Hmm.
To not transform into a werecupine.
(chuckles)
SEA:
So the Shattering speaks in your mind—the voice you’ve heard before says,
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Ahh, my little one. You can have all you desire. You can be normal. Human. The curse gone.
MARIS:
And I think in my head:
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are you offering me?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
You always were the smartest of the three.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I agree.
MIK:
(laughs)
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
(chuckling)
So do they.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
It is difficult, what I ask. You must let the fairy fall.
MARIS:
And I consider it…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hmmm.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
You must not do it with your own hand. Just let his fate happen.
MARIS:
And I, in my mind, say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I can’t do that. Is there another way?
The sound of the Shattering vanishes again.
SEA:
And you’re standing in the hall right in front of the door. But you get a sense of disgust from the thing.
MARIS:
Like I’ve been rejected.
SEA:
Yep.
MARIS:
Okay. So then I batter through the door.
SEA:
(laughs)
Okay. So, back into the hall.
Eggerton, you’re now scrambling madly way with a big gash on you. And Blat, what are you doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh Eggerton, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry I have to do this, I’m sorry buddy, I have to do this…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, it’s okay! I’ve got an idea. I’ve got an idea! I’m gonna… uh… uh…
I don’t have an idea.
Laughter.
Dramatic music.
SEA:
And the Slaad launches at at Eggerton.—roll Defy Danger, Eggerton.
Mike rolls. Groans around the table.
MIK:
3.
SEA:
And skewers Eggerton right on one claw, and lifts him up to the sky.
More groans.
SEA:
Eggerton you’re going to take 4… oh no, sorry, it’s the wrong die.
MARIS:
400 damage.
SEA:
Now do you have armour, Eggerton?
MIK:
No.
MARIS:
Ha! No.
He has arms?
SEA:
Okay, so 4 damage, 2+2, 4 damage.
MIK:
I have 1 hit point.
MARIS:
(gasps)
SEA:
So the Slaad is lifting this little body up to the sky—and that is when the door explodes inward. And what do they see come bursting into the hall?
The music returns, triumphant.
MARIS:
They see this larger-than-Slaad, humanoid, but more porcupine, so there’s sticky-uppy spines on the head, and the back is full of these spines which are fully erect, and a long tail sweeping back and forth with the same kind of spines. Just running, loping down the aisle between the pews.
SEA:
With gleaming eyes.
MARIS:
Making dishwasher noises.
(hisses and gurgles)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I certainly didn’t expect that to happen.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(groans)
MARIS:
So I run right for the Slaad that’s got Eggerton.
SEA:
Yup. Roll.
MARIS:
What am I rolling?
SEA:
Roll Hack and Slash.
MARIS:
(rolling, laughs)
Well, Sean, what if I don’t roll well?
SEA:
Well, this may be the end of Eggerton!
MARIS:
Yeah, see? It’s a 6.
I can do a special feat?
SEA:
Yes. So you could use one Rage to perform an impossible feat of strength.
MARIS:
So could I use it to roll myself up in a ball and take out the Slaad?
SEA:
Sure.
MARIS:
Okay. We’re going to say that to save your life.
SEA:
Okay, so you’re going to take a Rage point…
MARIS:
Yup.
SEA:
You’re going to spend a Rage. So she’s going to spend a Rage…
MARIS:
And so as I’m running, I just curl myself up into a ball and head right for the Slaad.
SEA:
So basically it’s like werecupine bowling. And it just sends the Slaad and you and everyone flying in every direction and takes out a bunch of Slaad. And the priestess stands up and is like,
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Rrrrgh! I must do everything myself!
SEA:
And she is going to turn on…
MARIS:
Darcy?
SEA:
Darcy the werecupine.
MARIS:
Who only has 4 hit points.
MIK:
I have 1 hit point.
SEA:
So you see her hold her hands in front of herself and then this energy starts to form and then she just slams it forward. This bolt just flies right past you as you roll through, sending Slaad flying, and it hits a bunch of Slaad in the distance that all immediately just look up, confused, as their bodies all roll up in flame. And they all wave “Bye-bye!” and they just, poof! disappear.
MARIS:
(laughing)
It’s so sad.
Okay.
SEA:
So the Slaad that dropped Eggerton is getting up and is looking around:
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Where is he?! I must defeat him!
MIK:
I’m gonna pop a fairy cake.
MARIS:
That’s a very good idea.
SEA:
Okay. Roll Fairy Cake.
MIK:
That is an 8… +1! 9.
MARIS:
Nice.
SEA:
(laughs)
I will let you pick which affliction you are afflicted with. And roll what you get back.
MIK:
I’m going to be drunk.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
And I’m not a nice drunk.
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay. So you are afflicted with angry-drunk.
MIK:
I got 8! 8 points.
SEA:
You get 8 hit points back. Okay.
And the priestess is charging forward. Blat, you see her charging towards the werecupine.
So you sense the bolt just miss you.
MARIS:
Yup.
SEA:
And then you see her running towards you in her plate armour, Darcy.
Any of you can act at any time.
And the Slaad is moving in on Eggerton. She found him.
MARIS:
Okay. So again, Darcy flings herself upright, and again does the the spike throw.
SEA:
Okay! On who?
MARIS:
On the priestess.
MIK:
High Priestess Ithcar.
SEA:
Okay! Roll it! This is Volley, you get your Dex bonus.
MARIS:
Right.
I’m a terrible roller. 6.
SEA:
Okay so the priestess literally… there’s just a look of shock on her face as she slides on her back, and so slides right under as these two darts fly through the air. And Blat, you see them slam on the wall just past you, these giant, almost metallic-looking darts, as the priestess then rolls forward and she actually slams into you so hard that one of your spines goes right into her chest…
MARIS:
Excellent.
SEA:
But she touches you, and you feel this horrible life force draining. You can see the blackness seeping into her, out of you, your soul.
And that’s 4 hit points.
MARIS:
I’m dead.
Oh wait! I had Armor.
SEA:
What? Oh yeah. You would have taken 2 less.
MARIS:
So I’m not dead though.
SEA:
Well, you just hit the ground. Don’t worry, you’re still alive.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
But you think she’s dead.
Okay. And Darcy’s body hits the ground, and transforms back into the lifeless form, and is in the exact place that you saw that body, Blat.
Gasps.
MIK:
Snap.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s. It.
I’m sorry, Eggerton. I don’t know what else to do.
You want Morrigu? Well, here comes mother-flippin’ Morrigu.
BAZOOKA!
The bazooka starts to materialize and once again stalls, metal pieces zinging through the air in slow motion.
SEA:
Okay. You feel this force, Blat, fighting at your brain, trying to take over. Roll.
Carter rolls.
SEA:
Partial success. What’s your Wisdom? Do you have Wisdom?
CARTE:
7. No. Just 7.
MARIS:
(laughs)
There’s no wisdom there.
SEA:
Okay.
Lightning flies out from Blat in every direction, striking seven or eight or ten Slaad that all just go “Bye-bye!” as they disappear in puffs of smoke.
And the bazooka appears. But it is so—the lightning is just hitting it and shocking you, so you’re going to take some damage. But the bazooka does appear. You take 2 hit points of damage, Blat.
And at the end of it the screen appears in front of your face. But it’s like zipping out—zipping in—zipping—MALFUNCTION. And then it goes green.
A last resounding click.
SEA:
OPERATIONAL.
MARIS:
Ha ha.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s Priestess Time.
SEA:
The priestess turns to look at you and her eyes get wide.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
As the Slaad say:
Bye-bye.
Laughter.
CARTE:
Pull the trigger.
SEA:
Roll Volley.
CARTE:
8. +Dex would be a 9.
SEA:
Okay. That’s a partial success.
So the priestess, at the same time fires her Corruption Blast at you when she realizes we’re going to do. But then…
So roll your damage. As your missile fires off, steam coming out of it, as it comes in short range to take her…
CARTE:
8.
MARIS:
8! Nice.
SEA:
And there is this fiery explosion. You just see all these waving hands—“Bye-bye!” “Bye-bye!” “Bye-bye!” And you see her scream as she’s thrown backwards, part of her armour melting into her skin, for 8 damage. She looks hurt.
MARIS:
Oh, she only looks hurt.
MIK:
Her makeup’s still in place.
MARIS:
Yes.
SEA:
But as the fire and smoke all clears, you see her on one knee, slowly standing up.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
That was a mistake, Prophet.
SEA:
And the Slaad is going after you, Eggerton. The Slaad has now found you, and what are you doing?
MIK:
I saw Darcy fall down.
SEA:
Yup?
MIK:
And that, as an angry drunk, made me angry.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
It looks like she’s lifeless. Her body just hit the ground.
A distant hum of harp music.
MIK:
And I remember something the mixing bowl said, in a bit of a haze. And it was:
MIKE (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
You can be any of them that you see.
SEA:
Yes.
MARIS:
Oooo.
MIK:
And I howl with anger.
SEA:
Yup.
MIK:
And roar like a giant bear.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
And charge at the Slaad.
SEA:
So you see Eggerton suddenly—give us what Eggerton’s bear roar would sound like?
MIK:
Rarrrarrarar!
SEA:
And he just suddenly… charges the Slaad. And if you are looking closely, you might notice that his teeth have gotten a little, like, sharper.
And roll to Hack and Slash as this tiny little fairy impacts with the Slaad.
Mike rolls.
SEA:
+Strength?
MIK:
That’s minus 1 for a…
MARIS:
(laughing)
Oh no.
MIK:
6.
SEA:
…and so basically bounces off the Slaad, and goes skimming across the other direction, sliding past a couple other Slaad that sort of try to step out of the way. And the Slaad leaps after you, chasing.
The priestess is now slowly approaching you.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Let’s go, prophet boy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This is one messed up religion.
SEA:
And she runs at you with her hand outstretched, trying to touch you with her hand.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
In Morrigu’s name!
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I thought I was Morrigu!
Carter rolls.
MARIS:
Ooo. That’s a good one.
CARTE:
That’s an 11.
SEA:
What happens?
CARTE:
Well, it’s the old middle school trick. She flies at me; I step aside and stick my foot out.
SEA:
And she goes headfirst into the altar, and you hear this horrible clang! of the metal hitting.
She takes 3 hit points, and blood is trickling down her armour plate as she slowly stumbles back to her feet.
And Darcy. You’re starting to come back. You realize that… the room is blurry, and there’s Slaad running around, and you see Eggerton dash past you, roaring, and bounce off of a Slaad. And the High Priestess is turning, now that she’s closer to Blat, and is about to reach out to touch him.
MARIS:
And you’ve… I am back in human form?
SEA:
Yes.
MARIS:
Yes. Okay. So I stagger up, or I crawl over—I’m obviously very disoriented. And I just touch Blat’s ankle.
SEA:
Yup.
MARIS:
And I cast Cure Light Wounds.
SEA:
Roll it!
MIK:
(to the tune of “Rawhide”)
Git that light wounds rollin’. Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’… Rawhide!
MARIS:
(laughs)
It’s a 7.
SEA:
Okay. So when you cast a spell, the only thing on Cast A Spell is whether you keep it or not.
MARIS:
(reading)
Yeah, here we go. And I don’t, I believe.
SEA:
In this case, yeah. You have a choice: you can draw unwelcome attention…
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
You can take a ‑1 ongoing to Cast Spells, or you can lose this spell. It’s your choice.
MARIS:
But I can relearn it once I commune with my goddess?
SEA:
Yes.
MARIS:
Yeah, I’ll lose it for now.
SEA:
Okay, so you’re losing the spell. So did you roll what he gets?
MARIS:
And then I “Heal an ally you touch of 1d8 damage.”
(rolls)
1. Sorry!
SEA:
So you get 1 hit point back, Blat.
MARIS:
You have 6!
SEA:
And she lunges forward to try and touch you, just to slap you with her hand. But you see her hand is glowing the strange dark black as she tries to just slam her hand into you. Roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
Pretty good.
CARTE:
9.
SEA:
Okay, so that’s a partial success. So you dodge her hand… but you stumble backwards and you fall off the the raised where you’re near—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yagh!
SEA:
And you’re now on your back, so you’re at Disadvantage. And you see her just turning her attention to Darcy who is half dead, her feet just laying there.
And you now have a Slaad that’s coming for you. What are you doing?
MIK:
I’m going to challenge the Slaad as a grizzly would!
SEA:
Okay, which is?
MIK:
Well, a grizzly would stand up and roar, and then run forward and grapple with claws and teeth. So I’m going to run forward with really short fingernails.
SEA:
Yup. That you bite.
MIK:
Yeah, because, you know, nerves.
And try and jump on the Slaad as it runs at me.
SEA:
Love it. Roll it!
MIK:
That is a 5.
Laughter.
MARIS:
We’re all going to die.
SEA:
So tell me what happens. Play this out for me?
MIK:
I jump onto the Slaad, and it doesn’t see me at first, because I’m kind of little. And it kind of turns around, and when it turns really quickly I go flying off again.
THE CAF:
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Wow! So… really, Eggerton! Like as a little fae, you took down that Slaad?!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
I took it down with just one hit. It was really impressive. I know Blat, you know, he likes to remember his role in all of this, with his—we’ll just call it a banana for right now. Really, though, it was…
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So you were just, like, one with the grizzly?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yeah! You know, I had learned that I had this shapeshifting ability through my druid training, but I was always a little shy about it—
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Morrigu is inside me!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes, Morrigu is very good.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
So what happened, Blat? You were on your back and you saw your friend, what was it? What’s her name?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Darvin!
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Darvin. What happened? How did you ever get out of that situation?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
The thing I knew what to do. I simply aimed for the priestess and fired away.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Wouldn’t that… wouldn’t that also kill Darvin?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Quite possibly. But again, I didn’t know what to do. It might actually have been the worst decision I ever made.
WHAT HAPPENED NEX:
Solemn music.
SEA:
Inside the temple, we see the Slaad sort of wandering around in disarray.
SEAN (AS SOME SLAAD)
Uh, I’m not sure what to do…
SEA:
And we come in closer, and we see Eggerton limping up with a giant gash to stand beside Blat as they stare down at the slightly-charred, dead body of Darcy.
The music grinds to a halt.
THE CAF:
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
That’s not what happened, Blat!
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I’m pretty sure that’s what happened.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
No it’s not. Darcy was fine! She’s the one who shaved both of us.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Darvin did?
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Yes. Okay, this is off the record right now, Rando…
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Okay.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Look, I was trying to be a grizzly, but you know, it wasn’t really working out—
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
You’re little!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
(laughs, pauses to collect himself)
Yeah. Yeah and it wasn’t really going so well for me, but I was I was hanging in there, and you had already shot your banana off…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I did what?
I haven’t done that in years.
Laughter.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Rando, quiet.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Okay.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Okay, so you were standing there and you’d already fired your banana off. And when the priestess turned to come back at you, that’s when Darcy used the last bit of strength she had to stand up and pick up a quill from the ground…
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Ah!
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
And jab it into the priestess’s eye.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
(horrified)
Oh.
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED NEX:
SEA:
Eggerton is stumbling up, with a giant gash, to stand beside Darcy. And both of them are looking down at Blat, who is laying on his back, mumbling.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(weakly)
Did I do it? Did I do the thing?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(weakly also)
Yes, Blat. You did the thing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I think Morrigu is inside me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Who?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Mor… it’s not important.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We all have a bit of goo inside us, Blat. It’s okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
See, this is why I’m not religious. Because frankly, it all gets a bit weird after a while.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
Did you see what she did with that quill? It’s so gross!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No I didn’t see—I thought I fired off a last bazooka shell.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, you were out of bazooka shells. You were stumbling around, and then you hit your head off of one of the Slaad, and were lying down mumbling about goopy stuff, and that’s when the High Priestess was about to lean over and suck your soul or somethin’, and Darcy grabbed a quill and just jammed through her eye.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What are you talking about? The priestess was—AUGH MY LORD.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, right there!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(heaving)
Ugh! Augh!
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Prophet? Would you like a bucket? Here you go.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ugh. Yes. Thank you very much.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It was surprisingly easy to do.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, don’t say… that makes it worse!
And also—what the hell happened to you earlier?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t want to talk about it.
THE CAF:
The front door jingles and Darcy enters.
MARISA (AS OLD DARCY)
Oh no. Are you just wearing a robe again?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Hey, look everyone, it’s Darvin!
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh you’re Darv—you’re Darcy? They were just telling us about the amazing—the temple, with Idris and how you won the day by putting one of your quills through the eye of the Priestess!
MARISA (AS OLD DARCY)
Oh, yeah, yeah. That wasn’t the last time I put a quill through someone’s eye, let me tell you.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
Oh wow. Wow. This is the best story ever! I’m going to go get this down. Thank you—thank you, Eggerton, for introducing me to both of them.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
No problem! Thanks for everything. Now remember, when you describe this, I had rippling muscles, and a large broadsword.
SEAN (AS RANDO)
And the sword. Got it. Thank you all. It was nice to meet you, Blat. Nice to meet you. Darcy.
MARISA (AS OLD DARCY)
Okay, son.
SEA:
And he leaves.
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Darcy! How are you doing. We haven’t seen you in a while.
MARISA (AS OLD DARCY)
No, it’s true, it’s been a long time.
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
I have scones!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Can I have one?
CARTER (AS OLD BLAT)
Oh yeah. Here’s a scone.
(whispers)
I’m not allowed to heat it up. But I’m going to heat it up.
MARISA (AS OLD DARCY)
No—
MIKE (AS OLD EGGERTON)
Oh no…
The smoke detector begins to beep.
SEA:
Beep-beep-beep-beep!
SEAN (AS THE BARISTA)
Oh no, the alarm! What’s going on?

OUTTAK:
Laughter.
MARIS:
Ah, lord…
CARTE:
“You shall battle me! The Great Waffles!”
SEA:
There’s tea everywhere.
EL:
That was autocorrect.
Laughter.
MARIS:
Oh God.
EL:
And I was like, “Well, it kind of fits. As long as he doesn’t choose it for like, a major character.”
MARIS:
Yeah, way to go, Sean!
MIK:
Yeah, with a really heavy, dark plot point.
SEA:

I’ve been waiting for this moment."

Fast-paced music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
Last time on the End of Time and Other Bothers…
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
Darcy. Battle accepted.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why am I battling anyone?
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
I am Waffles.
MARIS:
What is standing in front of him is this huge, glowing-eyed werecupine.
SEAN (AS WAFFLES)
What is this? What are you?!
MARIS:
Which is a were-porcupine.
MIKE (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
You can be any of them that you see.
MIK:
And I howl with anger.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Rowr!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sure nothing bad’s going to happen if I should touch the altar. Here!
SEA:
You see Eggerton’s body, lifeless. Darcy lying in a pool of blood.
Blat’s distorted voice echoes, speaking in an unknown language.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
You are the next Prophet! You must simply use your power.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I do not need the power of Morrigu.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Kill the little one.
MARIS:
(gasps)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
SEA:
Lightning races down over all the wood and strikes in at Blat as one of the giant limbs tears off the tree.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
There, prophet. But a few more and you will have all you’ve ever wanted.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The High Priestess was ready to lean over and suck your soul or something. And Darcy grabbed a quill and just jammed through her eye.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What are you talking about? The Priestess was—aaugh!
MAIL DELIVER:
SEA:
We are in the giant tree: the temple Idris. Darcy and Eggerton look haggard. Eggerton has a giant slash down his side and they are standing above Blat, who is just starting to get to his feet.
Around them is chaos. The tree is cracked in places and burned all down one side, as if lightning had struck it. And Slaad, still a good number of them, are wandering around in a very confused state.
SEAN (AS VARIOUS SLAAD)
(muttering)
I’m not sure what we’re supposed to do.
Do you know what we should do, Glytha?
I’m not sure what we should be doing.
The players are silent.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
I’ll just keep doing this.
Laughter.
SEAN (AS VARIOUS SLAAD)
I don’t know what’s going on. Do you know what’s going on?
He’s the Chosen One! He killed her! I don’t know what to do.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(weakly)
Blat. Are you okay?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I… have had better days.
All right. I don’t want to have to do this, but I am terribly hurt. Darcy, how are you doing?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m not good, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right.
Eggsy? Hand out some fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. I’ve got a blue polka dot one for you. Here, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’ll be good. I think it’s got a bit of peppercorn in it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oooh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh and Darcy, I’ve got a purple swirly. I know you’ve always admired those.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ll take whichever one you got.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. And then I’m gonna have this triangular one that I was experimenting with.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How did you make it triangular?
SEA:
Roll for Fairy Cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That is a 7.
CARTE:
Dangit.
SEA:
Uh, Blat? Pick a side effect.
(to Mike)
And roll what they get.
MARIS:
Is he rolling separately for fairy cakes, or that’s a universal Fairy Cakes?
SEA:
That’s it for everyone. It’s a universal Fairy Cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
2.
SEA:
Don’t you get a +Wisdom?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That is including the +Wisdom.
SEA:
You each get 2 hit points.
MARIS:
(laughs)
Oh boy.
CARTE:
That seems… very chintzy.
SEA:
And your side effect is what, Blat?
CARTE:
I’ve given spontaneously deaf.
SEA:
The entire party is deaf.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You guys feeling better now?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouting)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shouting)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What? I can’t—I can’t hear you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(shouting)
Hey, guys, I can’t hear you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I can’t hear you. What… what was in this fairy cake?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why aren’t you talking?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay. Look at my mouth. It’s moving. Words are coming out.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why is your mouth moving like that with no words. Why aren’t you reacting to no words coming out of your mouth? That would make me kind of panicked. I don’t know—I’d feel bad about that. I’d be worried.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This is a cruel joke that you’re playing, because the mouth is moving…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did you guys hear me? I can’t hear anything.
SEA:
Darcy, you notice the hair on your arm starting to stand up, and it’s all starting to point towards Blat.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey… what’s happening? Look. Look at my arm.
MARIS:
And I hold my arm up so they can both see what’s going on.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Quit pointing your arm hair at me. It’s freaking me out.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Look at my arm hair! Isn’t it freaking you out?
SEA:
Eggerton, you see Darcy’s hair starting to pull towards Blat, and you realize that your hair is all starting to—your arm hair, everything is pulling towards Blat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This is an unusual sensation. Blat? Blat? Hey, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t need your hair.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat. Where are you going?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m walking away from both of you! I don’t need your hair. I’ve got some on my head, and… well, really not much anywhere else, but I’m fine with that. Everyone’s hair—I’m leaving the tree. I’m walking backwards out of the tree.
SEA:
You see the hair on Blat’s head just suddenly sprout out in every direction.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, now I feel I probably look ridiculous.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What is happening? Is this something to do with a whole Morrigu thing?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe this is what happens when you have a triangular fairy cake. It’s an unexpected side effect that has turned everybody’s hair sentient.
SEA:
And that’s when the lightning bolt strikes from the heavens, through the tree, straight into Blat, arcing out into both of you and a bunch of Slaad all around you, sending everyone flying backwards towards the wall of the tree.
Everyone screams.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ouch!
SEA:
Okay. Everyone takes 2 hit points of damage—
Laughter.
MARIS:
Oh, come on!
CARTE:
That’s what we got back!
MARIS:
I just got it back!
SEA:
Well, not you, yeah, Blat, you don’t take any.
MARIS:
Oh.
MIK:
So everybody except for Blat.
SEA:
And you see a couple Slaad erupt into flame and wave at you—“Bye-bye!” and poof, they’re gone.
MARIS:
Awww. That’s so sad.
CARTE:
Oh, that’s unfortunate.
SEA:
And the tree explodes at the top and you see more bolts of lightning striking down at different points of the tree but not coming into hit Blat, and you see this dark, dark cloud swirling above the tree, way up above. And the wind is now roaring into the cavity of—this massive cavity of the tree that you’re in. And Blat, you are like, blackened and singed but relatively okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Looks like we’re getting some weather!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’re getting a lot of weather.
SEA:
You can barely start to hear each other.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did you say pleather?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Pleather? No, I don’t need another fairy cake. The sky! Look at the sky!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What guy?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That… there’s no other guys.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What is going on? Where’s all this wind coming from?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Why is your hair in love with me? Get away! I’m walking away! I’m not interested in your hair!
SEA:
The wind is now picking up. It’s like a cyclone. It’s roaring into this space. You see Slaad being slid around the floor, trying to walk and just, like, not going anywhere. And it’s increasing.
And another bolt of lightning comes down and strikes Blat right in the head—doesn’t seem to faze him—and sort of arcs off into the tree making black marks. You hear a ripping sound as a fissure in the tree starts at the top and just races down towards the ground, like a roar. And you hear another branch breaking off, falling down and hitting the ground outside and sending a shockwave through the room.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t want to point out the obvious, but Blat is a living lightning rod! We’ve got to get away from here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right! Everyone get a buddy. Let’s buddy up. Make sure everyone is safe.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m not going near you. Eggerton’s my buddy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, buddy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Buddy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re buddies.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yup.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Does this mean that we get to share stuff? Because you’ve got a sweater that I saw you wearing back at the Academy—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I haven’t felt this lonely since grade school.
SEA:
Outside, the Slaad are trying to close some doors, and you can just hear this roar of the wind outside.
And that’s when… Blat, that’s when you see a small figure in a robe forcing their way past some Slaad into the chamber.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I have mail for the Sisters! I’ve come from Dragon Mountain?
Who the hell are you people?!

Episode 12: Journey to the Temple, Part 5.
TEMPTATIO:
SEA:
Magnus, you step into the Temple Idris. You’re not sure where your party is that you were traveling with. There is—it came out of nowhere: a cyclone coming down on the tree. You saw explosions and lightning and giant branches the size of cities falling. And you just manage to sneak in as these creatures, which are like demons with frog faces, were trying to close the door and weren’t really paying too much attention to you.
And inside you just see this giant empty circle in the centre of the tree where the altar used to be but it’s half-destroyed and you see one gentleman standing there and no one’s coming near him. And do you want to describe what he sees, Blat?
CARTE:
Well, I am a half-demon about six feet tall, bright red skin, pointy ears. All of my hair on my head is standing on end, and lightning keeps hitting the top of my head.
SEA:
(chuckles)
You see a bolt of lightning come down, hit his head and arc off into the wall. Another fissure-like crack in the wall of the tree is racing down from the top towards the bottom. You hear another branch starting to snap off.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey, Blat, could you maybe stop?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(snaps)
Oh, I’m sorry! Is this bothering you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I just think the Slaad are getting scared, and you know they look like they get scared easily. I don’t want them to be scared. Hey buddy—buddy, you need to hold my hand.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
I’m trying! I’m trying!
SEA:
You see a Slaad fly past Egerton and get caught in the cyclone winds and finally catch a wall.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s really sad when they say “Bye-bye” and I’d prefer if they could stop doing that, so if you could stop with the whole weather, and the cyclone, and the lightning, and the tree falling down, I’d really appreciate it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m not doing this on purpose!
SEA:
And another bolt of lightning strikes down, in and all around Blat, just lighting up the whole chamber. But it’s now getting dark in here. The wind is decreasing, and it’s getting really dark, as the clouds above have completely blacked out the sky.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(shouting)
I think we have to get out of this tree. I don’t know what’s going on!
SEA:
One of the Slaad goes sliding past.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
We got the doors closed, Chosen One!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Don’t close the door. Everybody out! Out of the tree! Pick a buddy, get out of the—
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
But I just got here. This place has gone to hell! Who are you people?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That little Slaad is yelling at us!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
He’s got a really short arms for a Slaad.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Where are the Sisters?! I have mail! What the hell?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry, are you being helped?
SEA:
(laughs)
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What happened to the tree?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hi, I’m Eggerton. It’s nice to meet you. We’re here on an adventure—we came to see the Oracle but don’t think the Oracle is here anymore. And then Blat started talking kind of funny in this weird BAHR BAR BAHR voice. And then I kind of turned into a bear. It was pretty cool. I was pretty tough. And—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Buddy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Buddy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey buddy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey. Let’s be quiet now, okay?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hi. Hi there. I’m Darcy and these are my friends. And we got in this temple through some weird reason.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Aw, we’re your friends? Awwww.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
With the Slaad—forgot about them. And we don’t know what’s going on.
Argh! I wish that lightning would stop. Who are you?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
My name is Magnus. Uh… I am a monk from Dragon Mountain. I deliver mail. I—I don’t know what’s happened. But I do know one thing. You need to kill that guy because he’s gonna kill us all!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I have considered that on occasion, but most of the time we decide against it.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
WHY?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, he’s one of our party, you see, and he’s… a friend, really. Blat! Stop it! Can you just move over to the other side of the room?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m not doing this on purpose! I’m sorry we’re inconveniencing the underage mailman!
But fine. I’ll stand in the corner of the tree if that’ll make you feel better.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m fifteen, I’ll have you know! I can… almost drink. And vote. In two years.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So… I’m sorry. You deliver mail here?
SEA:
And the lightning suddenly stops and the wind drops.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(crossly)
Thank you, Blat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know why you didn’t do that before. It got kind of inconvenient for a bit there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, really.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know how this works.
SEA:
And you feel Morrigu try to enter your brain—your mind, Blat. I need you to do a Defy Danger +Wisdom.
MARIS:
Defy Danger Wisdom!
MIK:
(snickers)
(sings)
Danger Wisdom!
SEA:
Defy Wisdom Danger!
CARTE:
2d6…
MARIS:
Oooo.
CARTE:
That’s a 5.
MARIS:
Danger welcomed.
SEA:
And as you are just—you can go back to asking your question, and what’s going to happen is, in the middle of you asking this question, you’re going to notice that Blat is rising up off the ground with dark orbs for eyes.
MARIS:
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So… I’m sorry, you deliver mail—? Oh, hold that thought. Blat, what are you doing now?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat could fly. Remember he flew when—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
It’s the black eyes, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? What? Black eyes!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s the black eyes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Black eyes! Oh geez.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s the black eyes… Would you let go of my hand?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, but I’ll just…. Okay, I’ll hold your other hand.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are we gonna do?
SEA:
And we’re going to play a game. And how the game is going to work is, we’re all going to go around the table, and we are going to try and think of something that would tempt Blat. One thing that would tempt Blat to cross over and serve Morrigu and the Shattering. And if anyone—we’re just going to go around, it’s just a game—and if there’s one that’s said and you’re like, I want to see that! you say, “I want to see that.”
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
And then we’ll roleplay it out. Okay? So I will start.
So… a nice shirt that has holes for wings.
MIK:
An advanced filing system that uses both the Dewey Decimal System, alphabetization and numerals.
JULIA:
A self-eating cake.
Laughter.
CARTE:
The world’s most efficient three-hole punch.
SEA:
I want to see that.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
So Blat, you get this strange sensation as you realize your feet are leaving the ground… and in front of you, you see a disembodied figure that you realize looks just like the High Priestess Ithcar. And she is grinning at you and she’s like,
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Now! Now, Chosen One! You have the opportunity to join with us… to join with Morrigu! And in return she will grant your deepest, deepest desire and… oh, what is this? What am I seeing? It is a special three-hole automated punch machine.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Those never work. I’m not tempted by that!
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Oh my God. I’ve never seen anything go through so much paper so quickly!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Really. How much paper are we talking about?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
I can’t keep enough paper around. Look at it! It’s like reams of paper are flying off the shelf!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
An entire ream of paper?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
In just one punch?!
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes!!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My God! This would change everything about the Home Office!
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes!!!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh no…
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
It could be yours. You could have it at your fingertips, your beckoning!
SEAN (AS THE HOLE PUNCH)
Oh, use me, use me, Blat! Look at me!
Chk-chk-chk-chk-chk-chk!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Whatever they’re offering you, you have to fight it!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You don’t understand! It’s something I’ve always wanted!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
A clean shirt?
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No! I’ve had plenty of clean shirts!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
A really interesting filing system?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No! The system that I use is perfectly good.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
A self-eating cake?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’re talking to the wrong one! That’s something he’d be interested in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait, so it’s a cake that eats itself?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Focus. Focus, you two!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh sorry, okay, yeah.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes. Join Morrigu! You are the Chosen One! The Prophet!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Don’t join Morrigu! It’s even a stupid name. Blat, come back to us!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wait a second. How are you talking to me. Didn’t you get some sort of a sharp object shoved directly into your brain.
SEA:
She turns her face so you can see the other side and there’s a quill sticking out of the eye.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(retches)
Aaagh! Please don’t show me that… please—I can’t—I can’t look at it. I’m sorry, I can’t.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
All right, I’ll take that as a no. But we’re not done. Morrigu has limitless power, Blat.
SEA:
Next offer.
MARIS:
Enh… you took all the good ones!
(laughs)
Um… A shiny pair of shoes that squeak really nicely.
SEA:
A book of free dry cleaning coupons.
MARIS:
(laughs)
That’s a good one.
MIK:
A hot pepper grinder that works just by squeezing it with one hand.
JULIA:
Pubic hair.
MARIS:
(laughs)
What?!
CARTE:
A bed that makes itself.
MARIS:
A shinier double-barreled bazooka…
AL:
Oooo.
MARIS:
With dials on it that can make it really precise.
SEA:
All right, we’re gonna see that.
Blat, you are spun around in the air.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wugh!
SEA:
And then you come to a stop in front of a gleaming set of doors. And she floats in front, ripping the thing out of her eye—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh!
SEA:
And throwing it away.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
This way it won’t bother you.
SEA:
And there’s this bleeding socket.
CARTE:
(laughing)
Ugh…
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Let me show you what’s behind this door. Do you want to see what’s behind this door, Blat?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! Tell her you don’t want to see what’s behind the door!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ask for Door Number 2. There’s always a better prize behind the second door.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Blat, ask the audience!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is it possible to ask the audience, or perhaps choose a different door?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Sure, we can give you anything you want. Morrigu can grant you all.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll poll the audience. All right, everyone! And you too, mail guy. You can participate. What should I chose. Should I choose Door Number 1 or Door Number 2 which hasn’t appeared yet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Don’t choose anything, Blat. Send her away!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Door Number 2!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! We don’t want him making any deals with her!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. No deal.
(shouts)
No deal!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No deal!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I would say that in the case of this deal, you should say “No deal.”.
SEA:
She lifts up the door and looks, like,
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
(gasps theatrically)
A B7-9000? Could that be a B7-9000 bazooka? No… we wouldn’t have access to that technology yet.
SEA:
And closes the door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry, I don’t know what a B7-9000 is.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
(seductively)
You don’t?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I have no idea.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
A multiple rocket launcher with heat-seeking missiles and an updated display that projects through objects.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(softly)
Projects through objects? My goodness. I’ve just been firing and hoping that I blow something up. I never thought that I could get something so precise. Really, I don’t—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes! Yes, Blat, yes… I can open Door Number 1.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Or… perhaps choosing Door Number 2, since you seem to be shying away from that. Yes! I chose Door Number 2, because it’s something that you don’t want me to choose, eye-socket woman!
SEA:
And lightning strikes down from the sky, hits Blat, arcs out, hits all of you, sending you all flying…
AL:
(scream)
SEA:
And Blat, you fall to the ground from like fifty feet up and hit the ground. You all take 2 more hit points of damage.
Groans.
SEA:
You all hit the ground… and this silence permeates through the room.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Door Number 2 is always a better choice.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. Evidently it gave me the chance to knock my head against the floor. How are you, mail delivery person?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I hurt all over.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah, that’s what it’s like hanging out with us.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Who… who gets struck by lightning six times? Do you have any idea what the probability of that is?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Quite low, I would imagine, yes, but we seem to be in a tree that makes this possible. Darcy, I think perhaps you and I and everyone else should hurry up and—
SEA:
Darcy is not getting up. The rest of you are brushing off, standing up… and Darcy’s form is crumpled, in the exact same position again that you saw in your vision.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(softly)
Buddy?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Darcy?
Oh no…
CARTE:
(anxious)
Blat gets down on his knees, and checks to see if Darcy is breathing.
SEA:
She is not breathing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh no.
I—I don’t—I don’t—I don’t know what to…
You! Mail kid. Did you come with anyone else?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah. I was with a whole party. I’m just the mail guy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Medical care! Is there anyone there who knows about medical care?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(panicking)
Well, yeah, there’s the head doctor, but he’s not here! And… I know a little bit. I mean, well, actually… actually…
(then, suddenly confident)
Actually, I know a lot.
SEA:
(laughs)
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I know a lot. I… I… I will save this person. I can do it. I can totally do it! I can do it. I’m really good at it, actually.
(laughs)
CARTE:
Blat picks Magnus up by his shirt collar and shoves him on top of Darcy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Here! Then work your magic. I don’t know why you’re delivering mail if you’re such a surgical expert! What’s wrong with her?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Well, she’s totally dead!
Laughter.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
That’s your problem. Yep. Dead dead dead. She’s not breathing. Nope. Oh, look at that. Oh… Her eyeballs aren’t contracting. Ah, yeah. She’s dead. Dead dead.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, un-dead her then! Do something!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right. I’ll try! Let’s see, uh…
(whispers)
Hey. Hey you. Um… you got to back me up here.
Laughter.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’ve really built myself up and, uh… it’d be really great if right about now, you came back to life.
SEA:
Darcy, your eyes open, and you are in a strange land without colour.
There’s mist floating around, where you can’t quite see the ground, and it’s really—everywhere you look, it’s like a slight disorientation that occurs, and then it just settles again, and you just see off into the distance. And you do see a large tower coming out of the mist, like miles off in the distance, and it’s always there no matter which direction you turn.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat? Eggerton? Buddy? Hello?
(mutters)
This is not where I was. This is so strange.
Hello! Little mail guy?
Hmm. All I keep seeing is that tower whichever way I turn.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
(a low growl)
I don’t recommend going to the tower.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Who. Who said that?
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Turn around.
MARIS:
I turn around.
SEA:
You just see the tower.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Oh, I always forget about that. Hold on a second, sorry.
Turn around again.
MARIS:
I turn around again.
SEA:
You still see the tower.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
S——. Hold on, hold on.
SEA:
This being materializes in front of you, and it’s just this guy standing there and he’s naked. He’s like,
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Guh! The robes!
SEA:
And he disappears and then he reappears and he’s got a scythe and some dark robes.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Welcome to death.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, come on!
SEAN (AS DEATH)
I hear that a lot.
SEA:
So Darcy, you need to roll Last Breath.
MARIS:
Oh man. It all hinges on this.
SEA:
(laughs)
Darcy’s very good at rolling.
MARIS:
I’m terrible at rolling. 9!
SEA:
9. Last Breath, 9…
MARIS:
Oh, that’s probably bad.
MIK:
(laughs)
Yeah. Don’t celebrate until you hear what he says.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Hmmm. Darcy, Darcy…
It might not be your time… but it might be. Come. Walk with me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
What can you offer me, Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What do you want?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
God, everyone always says that! I don’t know. I’ve gotten it all. I’ve gotten money, I’ve gotten sex, I’ve got it—I can’t use any of it! It’s nothing I can use here, it’s just an empty plane, forever.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I didn’t really think that Death was actually a guy with a scythe. I thought that was like an old wives’ tale.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
That part’s just an act.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ohh.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
It helps, you know… it presents more of a figure.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t have much to offer. I’m just a lowly person who was chosen to save the world and time and everyone in it. I mean, maybe that’s worth something.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Hmm. Might be worth something.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(lowers her voice)
Also, don’t tell anyone…
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But I can transform.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Yeah, I know. I’m Death.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
It’s right here on your file.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh.
SEA:
He’s suddenly holding a file.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh yeah. I see that, yeah. “Werecupine.”
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Yeah, werecupine right here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Mmm hmm.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
All right, the time thing’s interesting. That’s messing with me a little.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. I mean, who knows? If there’s a problem with time, that can mess with you too, right?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Yeah, I said that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I know, but I mean really mess with you. Like, maybe there’s no death or anything anymore.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
You know what I want?
I want you to find a way to bring me a fairy cake.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(to herself)
Oh boy. Everyone loves those fairy cakes.
All right. If I can get you a fairy cake, will you let me go back?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
And save time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, yeah. I mean, I’ll get you the fairy cake first and then I’ll focus on saving time.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Okay, the order is not important.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Oh, and Darcy, before you go…
Tell that little Magnus fellow I’m coming for him. Soon.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The mailman?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Yes. Is that what he said? Yes. That one.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
MIDROL:
Theme music plays.
EL:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey everyone. Sean here. I want to tell you today about a podcast that’s really close to our hearts.
What happens when an aspiring moon elf assassin, an evangelist of the Light and a hysterical and so, so lovable robot go on a quest under the guidance of Eric Silver as GM? Yep, you guessed it—you get Join the Party, one of the most inclusive and fun live play podcasts going. Every week I’m looking forward to their story. You know, what started as a fairy-tale wedding between two princes—come on, that’s so great!—and then quickly they’ve taken on every trope in the pop culture world. We cannot get enough over here. So what are you waiting for? Find out more at jointhepartypod.com and as they would say: let’s get this party started.
MUSIC STIN:
MIK:
Where are my wings? Come on, I need my wings.
CARTE:
You don’t actually need wings…
SEA:
Wings? Uh, Wardrobe on 3!
MIK:
Okay, I’m gonna go—
CARTE:
He doesn’t have to wear wardrobe…
SEA:
Okay. Okay, everyone, stay calm, I’ll be back.
Five minutes! Five minutes!
CARTE:
It’s not a visual medium.
JULIA:
Uh, Carter, can you come over here for a second?
CARTE:
Sure. Sure, Julian. Hey, listen, I want to thank you once again, coming out to do the crossover episodes. I think people are really going to enjoy it.
JULIA:
Yeah, I think it’s gonna be amazing. It’s just… I’m really embarrassed to admit this but… I’m kind of a bunch of episodes behind.
CARTE:
Oh no.
JULIA:
I don’t even know what’s happening. I don’t know how I’m supposed to be like an informed performer.
SEA:
Oh, hey guys. Have you seen Darcy? Three minutes. Have you seen Darcy?
CARTE:
She isn’t in this green room, so maybe try the blue room?
SEA:
Right. Got it. Thank you guys! Three minutes!
CARTE:
So, okay. You’re a little behind, but that’s fine. I mean it’s all improvisation. We should be able to get you up to speed pretty quick. What’s the last episode you’ve heard? Like, what number is it?
JULIA:
It’s like, 3 or 4.
CARTE:
3 or. Wow, you are far behind.
JULIA:
Yeah, well… we subscribed on iTunes and then it just kind of stopped.
CARTE:
Are you a Patreon subscriber? Like, maybe that has something to do with it?
JULIA:
I don’t think I’m a Patreon subscriber.
CARTE:
Okay. Well, it’s important to be a Patreon subscriber. If you give one or two dollars a month you’d be able to get some special extras, along with being able to get the episodes early. So you’d be all up to date in no time.
JULIA:
I mean, I’d be paying to hear myself, but that’s still pretty cool.
CARTE:
Well, it’s an edited version of yourself so it’s slightly superior.
SEA:
And that’s at patreon.com/albasalix. One-minute call!
CARTE:
One minute. One minute. So if you’re a Patreon subscriber, you’d get the episodes right away. And if you use the hashtag #otherbothers you’ll be able to talk to other people about our show.
What I think the actual problem is… is that this is a shoe box.
JULIA:
Ahhh. Shoe box.
CARTE:
Yeah. This isn’t a computer at all.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
RARRR!
SEA:
Aaa! There’s a bear chasing me! There’s a bear!
Exit, pursued by a bear.
BACK TO LIF:
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(whispering)
Seriously, like, um… it would really help me a lot because I have a kind of a reputation for being really good at this? So if you could just start breathing, just a tiny breath. Just one or two, and then you can totally die after that, but then it’ll look like I actually did my job. So, uh…
SEA:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Shouldn’t you compress her chest or something? Just do something!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m a monk! I can’t touch a girl’s chest!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You can’t touch…? What kind of a medical person can’t touch a patient?!
Here. Okay. I’m going to lift her legs above her head. Does that do anything? What does that do?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
You can’t lift a girl’s leg above her head and then touch her chest!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m not touching the chest!
Okay. Legs down, legs up. Legs down… come on, Darcy! Legs up. Legs down, legs up—I don’t know what I’m doing!
MARIS:
And suddenly Darcy kicks Blat in the face.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Daaargh!
MARIS:
And lurches forward and yells,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fairy cakes! Fairy cakes, get me fairy cakes!
Pandemonium.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m on it! I’m on it!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Totally did it! Totally did it. I did it. That’s it. I did it. Yep, she’s good. She’s good! I did it. She is totally alive. I told you I could do it! I told you. I told you! With the power of my mind.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(pants heavily)
MIK:
I run over and start throwing fairy cakes at Darcy’s face.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Just give me… give me the fairy cakes, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, here you go. Here, take all the fairy cakes. The fairy cakes are yours, buddy.
MARIS:
And I stand up, and I’m just twirling around and yelling,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fairy cakes! I have the fairy cakes!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I gave them to you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Come and get the fairy cakes!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But I just gave them to you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. I commend you on bringing her back from the dead, but you brought her back crazy!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I make no guarantees about my work!
SEA:
So you are at 1 hit point, so you’re aware.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
So you are still really hurt, but you now are covered in a pile of fairy cakes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I should eat one of these fairy cakes.
MARIS:
And I grab one and—I grab two, in fact, and I go,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(muffled eating sounds)
SEA:
Roll Fairy Cakes.
MIK:
That is a 5.
MARIS:
Does it not work at all, then?
SEA:
(laughing)
No. They’re really good tasting.
MARIS:
Oh God!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Okay, well, you probably, you know, took too many at once. I’ve always told you to just take a little bit at a time. It probably canceled itself out when you took two.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I was dead. I’m still almost dead. I need some help.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay okay okay…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You! Were you trying to help me?
MARIS:
And I look at Magnus.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey. You. Magnum.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Magnum.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Can you can you help me? I am really, really hurt here. Do you have any medicine or anything?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Well I… I just have this one healing potion.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(dangerous)
Give me the healing potion.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
But it’s for me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. No, it’s for me.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
No no. It’s actually for me? In case something bad happens. And I noticed that you guys… things are crazy around here!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Something very bad is about to happen.
MARIS:
And Darcy’s hair stands on end, and my eyes go yellow and all the hair starts to stand up on my arms. And I hold out my hand to you and I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Give me the potion.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay okay okay! Here’s the—here’s the potion! Just take it, just take it! Get away from me, you freak!
MARIS:
And I take the potion and I open—I take out the cork and I down it and one swig.
SEA:
(rolling)
All right. You get… 8 hit points back.
MARIS:
Woo hoo!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ohhh. That’s amazing! That’s really good stuff! Whoo!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s an interesting idea, having it in liquid form. It probably doesn’t taste as good as fairy cake. Just… you know, if you want to try a fairy cake. Do you want to try a fairy cake?
MARIS:
And I throw a fairy cake at Eggerton.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fairy cakes are stupid. Didn’t help me at all.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, this is a tasty fairy cake! Watch.
MIK:
And I eat the fairy cake.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
Roll for fairy cakes.
MIK:
That is a 5 again.
SEA:
Something’s wrong with your fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Something’s wrong with the fairy cakes… what did…
(gasps, whispers)
It was the lightning! The lightning did something to the fairy cakes. Oh no.
Give me the pouch! Give me the pouch!
MARIS:
So I take two fairy cakes out of his pouch and I put them in my satchel, and then I give him back his pouch.
MIK:
I take the pouch and I run off to the side and start running through them.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey listen, Magna… Magnus?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Magnus! Yeah, that’s my name.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. Heh. I’m really sorry for coming on so strong. I just—I almost died, as you probably saw. So I really needed your healing potion.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah yeah, yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sorry. Sorry about that.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
And now I am that much closer to being dead myself.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s really interesting, because I was just—
No. Never mind. We need to get this guy another healing potion really quickly.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fairy cake him!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. I think these are okay now. I went through all of them. Here, you can have one of these fairy cakes. This is a purple swirly, it’s kind of my thing. People really like it…
SEA:
(laughing)
He’s handing you a little baked good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So you can put that in your pouch. There you go.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay, uh, thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And now, when you eat that, only eat half, wait twenty minutes and see how you feel. If you feel like you need more, then take more, but know that sometimes it can take you a little further than you think it’ll take you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What kind of medicine is this?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s not medicine, it’s a fairy cake.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s flawed but at least it tastes good.
(whispers)
Don’t take it alone.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right.
SEA:
You hear a murmuring of the few Slaad—there’s like twenty Slaad left in this room.
SEAN (AS VARIOUS SLAAD)
(muttering)
The Priestess stirs!
Oh? The Priestess is back?
That’s what I said! Helen, go and check the Priestess!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Slaad!
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Yes, Chosen One!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The Priestess is…
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Standing right behind you, Chosen One!
CARTE:
And Blat quickly turns around.
SEA:
And you see the priestess rising off the ground with eyes black and a spike still through one eye, as she rises up, the still-battered armour stuck in her skin.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Don’t you ever die?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There’s something you don’t see every day—oh, I’m looking at it. Urghhh.
(retches)
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
If you keep doing that you’re going to dehydrate.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(retches more)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you have anything for nausea?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(laughing)
No.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh. Right. Probably just that healing potion, right?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
That’s all I had!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, sorry.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
You have made the wrong choice! You have chosen to abandon Morrigu! You will fall.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’ve never been to much of a religious person per se. So perhaps the next person that comes to visit your um, cracked-in-half tree will be able to help you out.
SEA:
And you see her raising her arms towards you, Blat, and this ball of blue energy is starting to flash in her hands. What are you doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Baaaaaaaaaaaaaazooka!
SEA:
Magnus, you see a bizarre contraption of tubular, gleaming material form on Blat’s shoulder, and a weird sort of square pop out and attach itself almost to his eye. And he’s pointing this device up towards this basically priestess in battered armour that’s rising up out of the ground with black orbs where her eyes would normally be. But there’s a spike sticking out of one of those black orbs.
And I need you to roll a Defy Danger, Blat, so that can be Strength or Dex.
CARTE:
Definitely Dex.
SEA:
I think you got rid of your—1, didn’t you, finally?
CARTE:
7.
SEA:
Okay. So it’s a partial success.
So you see this blue energy fire out from her hands, and basically explode right where Blat was standing as he stumbles backwards. Blat, you do take some damage. You’re going to take half damage as you stumble out of the way of this—but you see the floor actually start to like, almost age in high speed. The floor just starts to just age and wilt and crumble.
And Blat, you’re gonna take half… so you’re going to take 2 hit points of damage..
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oooo.
SEA:
And she screams and starts to fly forward, cackling.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Morrigu will teach all of you to disregard her power that lightly!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If you keep this up you won’t know if this fine young gentleman has any mail for you.
Laughter.
SEA:
And you all need to roll Defy Danger, since you’re not doing anything.
MARIS:
(sighs)
JULIA:
How do you do that?
SEA:
2d6, and you’re gonna add your Dex bonus or your Strength bonus, whichever is better.
MIK:
6.
JULIA:
9.
MARIS:
Hey, you’re exactly the same.
CARTE:
11.
MARIS:
So we’re both 11s.
SEA:
So Eggerton, she basically flies right into you and slams her hand on your chest. And you feel this fiery burning sensation and it burns through your clothing. You see a red melted mark to your skin.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(groans)
It hurts!
SEA:
And you take 4 hit points of damage as this searing hand stays on your chest as she flies past. Blat and Magnus, you guys stumble backwards as she comes past.
JULIAN AND CARTER (AS MAGNUS AND BLAT)
(shout in alarm)
SEA:
And you just sort of end up in a heap on the ground, falling over backwards… and Darcy. You can have whatever. You see this happening. You see her flying down, you see her striking Eggerton, and you can just tell what she’s about to try and do. What do you do?
MARIS:
Okay. I start running towards her and I take my satchel off and I step on Blat’s back.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ulk!
MARIS:
I launch myself up towards her and I take my satchel and I throw it over her neck, and then I just twist it around and I pull as hard as I can. Like, pulling her right back down to the ground.
SEA:
She screams—
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Aaaugh!
SEA:
—and is pulled down to the ground in the centre before you all, and you see Darcy and the High Priestess are sort of grappling and fighting back and forth over this thing that’s wrapped around her neck.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Help me!
(grunts)
SEA:
And her hands light up red as she turns and spins towards Darcy, who’s now stuck near her.
CARTE:
Blat stands up grabs his bazooka, flips it end over end, and swings it like a bat at the Priestess’s head.
SEA:
Roll it.
CARTE:
10!
SEA:
Roll your damage. Plus your Strength bonus.
CARTE:
I have none. That is a 3.
SEA:
Okay, so you do 3 points of damage.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Consider that a mail delivery, ya one-eyed priesty weirdo!
SEA:
Blat connects with the side of her head, and she spins herself around, flailing out with her hands. And Blat, you can choose on a 10 to do extra damage, or to not take any damage.
CARTE:
Extra damage.
SEA:
All right, so you’re going to roll another 1d6 on her.
CARTE:
1.
SEA:
And she spins around, almost against you and slams a hand into your chest for 3 hit points.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(groans)
SEA:
Burning into your chest, her hand just leaves this red outline of a hand as she pulls her hand away screaming,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Gahhh.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
You will die for Morrigu!
SEA:
And she then is going to—you see her starting to pull out another blue ball of fire between her hands.
Silence.
SEA:
And nobody does anything, so she blasts it right into Blat. Roll Defy Danger, Blat.
CARTE:
9 plus my Dex is 10.
SEA:
What do you want to happen?
CARTE:
Blat dodges out of the way of the blast… and just chucks the bazooka tube at her.
SEA:
(laughing)
Okay.
CARTE:
Spinning around, using his own momentum.
SEA:
Roll damage.
CARTE:
6!
SEA:
No bonus?
CARTE:
Yes! Another 2.
SEA:
So she like. blasts into the ground. You see the the far wall of the tree, where the blast ends up hitting, just start to decay and fall apart on itself.
And then takes the bazooka to the face. Now, you threw it, right?
CARTE:
Yeah.
SEA:
Okay. So—takes it to the face. And she like screams, and starts to lift up into the air again, the cord around her neck lifting Darcy with her up into the air.
MIK:
I run up… and, feeling the pain fueling me, channel the power of the bunny rabbit.
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
And jump really high.
SEA:
Yup.
MIK:
And grab her leg.
SEA:
Yup.
MIK:
And bite it. With bunny teeth.
SEA:
Awesome. So, first of all roll your, um…
MIK:
(laughs)
2.
SEA:
Okay, so what do we hear Eggerton say as he charges forward and prepares to leap?
MIK:
He goes,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaaa—
(chewing noises)
Laughter.
SEA:
And then faceplants and slides underneath the Priestess and Darcy who’s hanging there. And then he finishes his slide by impacting into the altar.
MARIS:
Okay. So Darcy’s now enraged because she’s being dragged up, which… as we all know now, the Rage translates into transformation. But I have to actually roll a die now to see who I transform into.
SEA:
Yeah.
MARIS:
(rolling)
So my hair stands on end, my eyes go yellow, a deep guttural roar comes from out of me and I transform into a… ooo! “A giant member of the ursine family.” Grizzly bear!
(roars)
SEA:
(laughs)
MARIS:
So now this priestess has a grizzly bear holding on—well, no, I’m not holding onto her. So as she’s pulling me up, I just—because I dropped the satchel, obviously, and my two claws, my huge paws go into her abdomen with my claws, and I just drag down.
SEA:
Okay. So, Magnus.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
I assume you’re slowly backing away at this point.
JULIA:
Yeah.
SEA:
Yeah. So you see this half-demon, red-skinned gentleman basically throw his weapon at this woman, screaming. You see the little one trip and slide under, and then you see the woman who took your potion transform into a giant bear, clinging on to this woman who’s rising up off the ground.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay, uh… you guys got this, right?
Laughter.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I mean, everything looks like it’s under control, so… I’m just going to go back to the door and hopefully it’s like a portal and I’ll go back to wherever I came from. So, uh, take care. It was nice meeting you well and… good luck!
SEA:
Darcy, as you hear Magnus, you see blood oozing out from under your claws, and she screams and is starting to sink back towards the ground from the increased weight. But she is actually raising another blue ball of flame between her fists. She’s like,
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
You will not beat Morrigu! You cannot beat a god!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Maybe I can’t, but a metal tube from the future can. Bazooka!
SEA:
And you’re firing?
CARTE:
I’m firing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Watch out for Bearcy!
MARIS:
(laughs, then, as Carter rolls:)
Ooo!
CARTE:
With my Dexterity bonus, that’s a 12.
SEA:
What happens?
CARTE:
I aim for the hole in her head. Just trying to make that godawful part of her anatomy go away.
SEA:
So the black eyes, with the—
CARTE:
Yeah.
SEA:
So Darcy.
MARIS:
Yeah.
SEA:
You hear a bazooka and you hear the sssss! of an incoming missile.
MARIS:
So I…
SEA:
You roll Defy Danger, is what you roll.
MARIS:
Oh no. No.
(laughs)
SEA:
(to Carter)
And roll your damage.
CARTE:
I’m aiming high.
SEA:
(laughs)
With a bazooka!
MARIS:
8. Oh, but I get a Dex bonus, right?
SEA:
Yeah. And remember you have armour.
MARIS:
Yes, I do have armour. 9 is what I rolled.
SEA:
Okay, so Darcy: you can minimize the damage that you take by just letting go, or you can go for a kill bite or something and maybe get hit by the missile.
MARIS:
I’m going to let go.
SEA:
You’re letting go. Okay. Roll your damage on the incoming missile.
MARIS:
5.
SEA:
So you all hear an explosion, and you hear a yelp from the bear as Darcy hits the ground, fur singed and on fire. You’re going to take half of that, so you take 2 hit points damage, which would be… you don’t take any.
MARIS:
I don’t take it because I have armor now.
SEA:
But your fur is singed… and the body of the Priestess hits the ground. Not moving.
MIK:
I get up and run over and jump on her.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s right, Eggsy. Finish her off. Even though it looks like the top of her head is missing—
(retches suddenly)
Augh! Agh! Why does this keep happening?! I haven’t eaten that much.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you need a fairy cake?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No. No. I…
Yeah, I’ve taken a lot of hits. Maybe give me a fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Here you go.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(from the other side of the room)
I told you you guys could do it! I’m just gonna go now.
The door won’t open! Why won’t this door open?!
Gah!
Laughter.
SEA:
Roll for Fairy Cakes.
MIK:
Roll for Fairy Cakes. 5 again.
(laughs)
MARIS:
(laughing)
Oh no.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What is this?! That’s literally all that you do. You bake things and we eat them later. And I was good for the fact that occasionally it drove us insane, or we were drunk, or we were stupid. But now it’s just junk food.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But there’s something wrong with them. I think maybe it’s the evil magic…
SEA:
Eggerton, you hear a voice and it is singing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
What? Oh no. What’s that voice? Do you hear the voice?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(puzzled growl)
Rrrrr?
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What is it, though?
SEA:
Darcy, in your current form, you hear a singing voice.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(softly)
Rrrr. Rrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think Bearcy hears it too.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hears what? What are you talking about?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you hear the singing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Before, we couldn’t hear anything, and now you’re claiming to hear singing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, it’s singing, it’s…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(hums)
Rrr rrr rrrr rrr…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, Bearcy, I can hear it too!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m really trying my hardest, and not freaking out that you’re just calmly referring to this thing over here as “Bearcy”.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but I learned that I can talk to all of the animals, so I understand exactly what she is saying.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
She’s not an animal; she’s the woman that we’ve been living with for the past few months!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, but now she’s in bear form, so she’s speaking like a bear. And I understand the—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Quit saying this like this makes sense!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did you not get this in your training? Because this was covered in my training.
MARIS:
And I amble over to Blat, and I sort of sit down beside him and start licking my paws and looking up at him.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See? She’s saying that everything’s gonna be okay and you should calm down. And also you should be nicer to me, she said, and probably, you know, lend me some extra shirts sometime or maybe a few credits if I need it, because I run out of supplies and I forget about them.
SEA:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If this mail kid could figure out how to unlock this door I might be leaving with him.
She keeps licking herself. The old Darcy didn’t lick herself.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr.
An eerie choir begins to sing.
SEA:
A blue light is starting to come from above, where it was dark… and slowly lightening up the whole place, and everything is just going blue.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It is a lovely hue of blue.
SEA:
Eggerton and Darcy, the singing is getting louder, and it sounds like a laugh you once heard.
SEAN (AS A VOICE)
(a woman’s merry, echoing laugh)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, so now we have mood lighting. Great.
SEA:
And a chariot, way above in what’s left of the stump of an open now to the sky tree, is circling. And at the front there’s flaming horsemen and weird old women with screaming faces, and all kinds of horrors and weirdness and some fairies and pixies. And in the chariot, circling down and around, is Celene.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The woman who made us breakfast!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s exactly what Bearcy just said, Blat. You should really try and listen. It’s kind of rude.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
The crack over here, it’s not working either! I can’t get through!
SEA:
And the chariot comes to a stop, with fire and whinnies and strange old ladies screaming… and stepping out is Celene, and she is glowing with the blue crown and flowing hair and robes. And she steps forward towards Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, there she is.
The top of her head’s gone. I hope that does the trick, because we thought we killed her once and we were wrong. But we think this time, we did it.
Also she’s a bear now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She says hello.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I can understand her. Thank you, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See, Blat? It’s just you. I don’t know why—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m the only one here who doesn’t speak bear. I’m sorry.
Mail kid! How are you with animal languages?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m pretty terrible… and I’m not looking! I refuse to look. There’s too much blue light! I hear screaming and old ladies…
I hate you people!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did you eat the fairy cake at the whole time, like all at once? I told you not to do that.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I didn’t eat your fairy cake, because they don’t do anything! I’ve seen like three people eat your fairy cakes. Nothing happens!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, there’s just a little bit of Morrigu on them.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
IF I COULD HAVE YOUR ATTENTION!
(clears her throat)
SEA:
The entire place goes black and dark… and then goes back to this light blue light.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(gentle once again)
Excuse me…
SEA:
—Celene says.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You were saying, Blat? You were pointing to this dead, crumpled body here for some reason?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, yes. This was the Priestess who tried to murderize all of us a few times.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes. Okay, good. And the Oracle, where is the Oracle?
MARIS:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So again, this lady here on the ground really tried to murder us, and, uh, I got into a fight with some of these frog people—like, you see over there? No, not that, not over there. That’s the mail guy.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Darcy. Or, sorry, Unghla… Would you mind, please, going into the back room, near where you came up from underneath?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrh.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
And please collect the Oracle. I sense that the Oracle is very scared right now and tied up in the storeroom. And just bring the Oracle back here for us, would you please?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr rr rrr.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Thank you, Darcy. I agree very much about him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right now, in our defense we literally just finished defeating her. We haven’t had a chance to search the area.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Ut-tut-tut!
SEA:
And she puts a finger on your lips.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Thank you, Blat. Oh, and who is this? Hello!
Whose pair of feet are sticking out of that crack in the wall?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(struggling)
I’m almost out! I’m almost there! Just one little inch more…!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Mm hmm.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, it’s okay. I’ll get him for you.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Please do that, Eggerton.
MIK:
And I run over and start pulling on Magnus’s feet.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
No, please!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s OK. She wants to say hello to you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
It’s okay! I’m really good. I’m really good! I don’t really want to see her. I don’t wanna—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There you go!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Augh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Come on over buddy. That’s it. Let’s meet Celene.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay. Okay!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are your eyes closed?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Nghh! I don’t want to see! It’s too scary!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Awww! Oh, it’s you, Magnus.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
You know my name?!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes! Oh, you are going to be in for some amazing adventures soon. Be sure to tell—I won’t tell you her name yet, but be sure to tell your future boss that the Goddess of the Moon says hello.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Oh yeah, I’ll totally do that.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Perfect.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Tell my future boss.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(laughing)
Yes.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
That you say hello.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Perfect!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
That’s great.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(suddenly fearsome again)
YOU’D BETTER.
SEA:
And the room goes dark.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(whimpers)
Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll tell her!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Perfect!
SEA:
And the light comes back.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Now—oh, here comes Darcy!
MARIS:
And I emerge with a figure riding on my back, and come back to the circle of people.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, I didn’t see that. I’m so sorry, Oracle. I thought you were a she but you are he! Well, let’s get some clothes for the Oracle, shall we please?
SEA:
There’s an emaciated man riding back on Darcy’s back, clinging to the fur.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Again, the Slaad didn’t tell us at all that this emaciated person was down in the tree basement. I do apologize for that. Again—we defeated great evil though! Great evil was defeated!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes, you did! I’m very actually impressed. I want to get back to that. But can someone please get some clothes for the Oracle?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um, yeah. Well, Blat, why don’t we use your shirt? I mean you’ve got a lot of them. And I’m sure—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
That would be such a noble gesture!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(mutters)
I’m constantly getting undressed in front of you people.
CARTE:
And Blat unbuttons his shirt, his great wings then pop out.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yagh!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sorry. Sorry about that. I’m… I’m half-demonic.
CARTE:
And I had my shirt over to the emaciated figure.
SEA:
Celene walks over and and guides his hands to the shirt, and you realize that he’s blind. And he starts to dress himself.
SEAN (AS THE ORACLE)
(weakly)
Thank you. Thank you. I haven’t spoken in so long.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes, I know. Please, please, does anybody have any water or anything like that for the Oracle?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I had some water but something happened to it.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You drank it, I believe, yes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Depends on whose version of events that you listened to, yes.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Mm hmm. Please give a fairy cake to the gentleman, will you, Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Here…
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Let me bless it first.
SEA:
And she touches the fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. Here you go, sir. Just put your hand out, and now, okay. Now, eat half, don’t eat the whole thing—
SEA:
He pops the whole thing in his mouth, and this blue light just emanates out of him, and he just sits up straighter. He’s like,
SEAN (AS THE ORACLE)
Oh! That is quite marvelous.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See, that’s how they’re supposed to work.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Hmm. Now.
Blat! Blat, Blat, Blat…
SEA:
And she caresses both sides of your face.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughs stupidly)
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Why? Why did you not choose Morrigu?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Choose the evil demon from the depths of the underworld…?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes. Did she not offer you power and glory and ruling the kingdom?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(dreamily)
No… something far better. A three-hole punch that will never jam.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(laughing)
Oh, you are delightful! Oh, I must have you in my collection. But that’s later.
So. The Oracle is speaking again and there’s but one thing left for you to do, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes…?
Silence.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(furious again)
OH, YOU HUMANS ARE SO RIDICULOUS!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr rr?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(sighs)
I agree, Darcy. Blat. Morrigu’s power base is now based here, and is coursing through you, even though you denied her.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. Again, not interested, despite the promise of the three-hole punch.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I told you, you had to totally kill this guy, but nobody would listen to me!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
The Oracle?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, he’s referring to me.
(whispers)
I think he has an anti-demonic prejudice.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Ah, yes.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(also whispers)
Everybody has an anti-demonic prejudice!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
All you must do, Blat, is gift and sanctify this temple again, as the Prophet, to the goddess of your choosing.
AND YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS, RIGHT?
MARIS:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I suspect, yes?
Um… could you just excuse me with the party for just one moment?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(lightly)
Of course! I’ll be over here with my scary chariot.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Heh. Thank you. Just a moment.
CARTE:
And he motions for Eggerton and Darcy and even his new friend Magnum to come into a little huddle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. So apparently, we can make all of this better again and make this a place that can accept… mail, I guess is what you were here for. They’ll accept and give out mail if we simply sanctify it with a new god or goddess.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I could be a god.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Not where I was going.
Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Dammit.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr rrr rrrrr rr?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What if we made your goddess…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s what she said! Blat, seriously, she’s just saying Loxsyn is a wonderful goddess, who is all about peace and love—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
—and might be a good fit here. I don’t know why you just don’t listen.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
She’s a bear.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. And she just explained herself very clearly.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(raises his voice)
Loxsyn! We choose Loxsyn to be the goddess of—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Are you sure, Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(whines nervously)
SEA:
And she’s suddenly standing right in front of you and you notice her teeth are very, very long.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr rrr rr?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Think carefully, Blat. Think very carefully.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr rr rrrr rr rrrr?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Lady… my friend died and came back as a bear. His whole purpose in life is to make fairy cakes. And now they don’t work. And this kid (who has a brilliant future as a surgeon or a medical professional by the way) just wanted to deliver some mail and that couldn’t happen. I think you are part of the problem. We all risked our lives to try and save you. And you have been particularly ungrateful.
The choir returns for a final climactic chord.
SEA:
And poof.
Blat is no longer standing there.
MARIS:
Oh God.

JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
My name is Magnus! I’m a monk from Dragon Mountain?
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Yes, Blat! Morrigu can grant your deepest desire.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Whatever they’re offering you, you have to fight it!
SEA:
You all hit the ground…
Everyone shouts in alarm.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Darcy?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Buddy?
SEA:
Darcy is not getting up.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What’s wrong with her?!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Well, she’s totally dead!
Laughter.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Welcome to Death.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, come on!
All right, if I can get you a fairy cake, will you let me go back?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
And save time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, yeah.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The priestess is…?
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Standing right behind you, Chosen One!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Don’t you ever die?!
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
You have chosen to abandon Morrigu!
MARIS:
(rolling a die)
A deep, guttural roar comes from out of me and I transform into a—oooh! Grizzly bear!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
The bazooka assembles and fires. A rocket explodes.
SEA:
The body of the priestess hits the ground.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(a merry, echoing laugh)
SEA:
In the chariot is Celene.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
The Oracle is speaking again.
And there is but one thing left for you to do, Blat: sanctify this temple again, to the goddess of your choosing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Loxsyn! We choose Loxsyn!
SEA:
And poof! Blat is no longer standing there.
MARIS:
(groans)
Oh God.
EVERYTHING DISAPPEAR:
SEA:
Darcy, Eggerton, Blat and Magnum—I mean Magnus—are all standing in what’s left of the stump of this massive tree, when Blat goes to say,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel that you’re being very rude and unfair and thus, you will not be the goddess of this large tree!
SEA:
And that’s when Blat and Celene the goddess of the moon and her chariot disappear.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr rrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She said “Oh jeez.”
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
My sentiments exactly.
SEA:
And a warm light starts to break through the clouds from above. And Darcy’s amulet around her neck begins to glow brightly with this warm, soft light and a shaft of sunlight breaks through the clouds and highlights all of you standing there, and you feel just enraptured by a divine presence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(softly)
Rrrrr.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(softly)
Rrrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(softly)
Rrrrr.
SEA:
And that’s when everything disappears.

Episode 13: Between, Part 1.
BLA:
Birds sing in the background, but there’s an unnatural edge to the sound.
SEA:
Blat, you appear suddenly in a glade—but the colour is off. It’s hard to even wrap your mind around how you know that. Everything is just a different hue.
There’s a path leading through this glade and off into the trees, and when you look upwards, it’s neither daylight nor night.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This is like the televisual device that I had as a child! My father and I could not afford a very good one. So the colour scheme was always slightly off. I’m quite used to this.
SEA:
And something flits past you in the corner of your vision.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh!
CARTE:
And Blat turns around to see if he can see what flitted past him.
SEA:
And you see a path that leads in that direction into the forest.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh. So I could go this way… or I could go the other way. It’s a game of Onesy-Twosy. What shall I choose?
(chants)
Onesy-twosies, apple and pear, tell me which way I should stare.
CARTE:
And Blat heads south.
DARCY, EGGERTON AND MAGNU:
SEA:
Darcy, Magnus and Eggerton, you all appear in a much colder, chillier place. It is a glade and there’s a path leading through this glade, but the colours are all like, strangely just off by a certain number of degrees. It’s hard to explain. The grass, when you look at it long enough, you say “That’s green.” But then, when you turn away, out of the corner your eye, it’s not green. And there’s just a dark forest and the sky above you is just a strange blank.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr rrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I agree, this is definitely very unusual. I’m not entirely sure what we should be doing here.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
This is really weird.
Silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(laughing)
Well, I guess we should start walking in a direction, because we have not been prompted with any other information that could help tell the story at this point.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right, well, let’s go this way then.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh—well, I was thinking we’d go the other way.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What—why would you want to go that way?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, it just seems like the natural choice. I mean, if you were to sit down and say, this direction is one way, and that direction is the second way, and then bounce back and forth with some kind of limerick or song in your head, you would probably land on this direction.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
You mean like onesy-twosy, redsy-bluesy?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, you’ve heard of it!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah. Like, five-year-olds play that.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but I mostly prefer to use apples and pears—it doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter. Okay let’s just go in this direction.
SEA:
Magnus, something catches your eye, off in the forest, like, as if you’re being watched.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(alert)
What’s that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What’s what?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
The thing over there.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Where?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
The… brush just rustled.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The brush rustled?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yes, the brush rustled. Brushes rustle! That’s what they do.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh-oh.
MARIS:
So Darcy uses her heightened sense of smell. Can I either pick up Blat’s scent or the scent of whoever’s in the bushes?
SEA:
Yes. Darcy, you can smell Blat going, like, it’s stronger in one direction.
MARIS:
Okay. So I start moving in the direction that Blat went in.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr! Rrrr rr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! She says she can smell Blat. We should probably follow her. Plus she’s, you know, a giant grizzly bear.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right. Sure. Let’s do that. Let’s follow a grizzly bear.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Onward!
BLA:
SEA:
Blat. You walk into a glade that’s identical to the glade you were in before.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(puzzled)
Oh…
SEA:
And again there’s a path that leads through it and out the other side.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Have I gone in a big circle? Oh no. Has Onesy-Twosy Apples and Pears… has it let me down? Oh, ever since I was a child that always put me in the right direction.
Well, I’ll have to test this theory. I’ll sally forth in the direction that I’m currently walking.
SEA:
And something flits across the path, almost right in front of you, but you just… it’s like you can’t see it clearly.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hmm. Perhaps I should get off the path and follow this thing that moved very quickly.
CARTE:
Blat heads in the direction of this movement that he saw.
SEA:
Okay. So as you approach the trees, they almost seem to bend away. There’s a path leading into the forest.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! I found the secret hidden path. Thank you… thing that moves quickly. Although that still doesn’t explain why Onesy-Twosy Apples and Pears let me down… I can’t think about that now.
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
(a high, child-like voice)
Well, that’s simple! It’s “Onesy, twosy, bottle and chair!” That’s the only one that works.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, you see, bottle and chair isn’t actually two sides of the same coin… Hey, wait a second! Who said that?!
SEA:
There’s nobody there.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I see. As punishment for defying a goddess, I’m now alone in the middle of a magical forest and slowly going insane.
SEA:
There’s a giggle.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Hee-hee-hee-hee!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m glad that you agree with me, brain! I’m slowly going mad. I guess I’ll take this secret hidden path deeper into the woods, and perhaps I’ll find someone I know. Or some confirmation that I’ve finally gone completely bonkers.
SEA:
And Blat steps off the trail and it closes behind him, but there’s a path leading in front of you.
DARCY, EGGERTON AND MAGNU:
SEA:
We come back to the three of you, who are traveling, and walking on the path that never turns…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sniffing)
SEA:
And all of a sudden—Darcy, you are back leading—you see the glade you started in. And now you smell Blat’s trail really getting cold. But you smell your trail in front of you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sniffs)
Rrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It wasn’t me. Don’t look at me!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr rr rrr rr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, no, sorry, I thought you said something else.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What’s she trying to tell us?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She says that she lost the trail of Blat, but she picked up our trail again. Which doesn’t really make sense, because we would have kept going the same direction that would make this a very, very small area for us to have wrapped around the whole way. So what’s probably happening is some kind of shift in the wind, which means our scents are being thrown ahead of us somehow, and confusing her bear mind.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Right. Or we just walked in a circle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, that is also possible. But I think my theory of shifting wind patterns and, you know, the changing climates of this land probably have more to do with it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
RRRRRR.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh yeah, sorry.
MARIS:
So I start to stick my nose into the bushes. Can I smell anything different or unusual?
SEA:
Roll for me. Discern Realities.
MARIS:
It’s a 3.
SEA:
No. You don’t smell anything, Darcy, except that you smell your path now, leading the way you’re going out of this glade again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr rr!
I don’t know where we should go! You’re the one with the big nose.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, it’s a nice-looking nose, yeah. But it’s still big.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Rrrr rr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Okay, fine. With your average-size grizzly bear nose that performs adequately under pressure.
MARIS:
So Darcy just starts in the direction that they were already going. And keeps going in that direction.
SEA:
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr rrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, just stop looking at her nose and let’s go.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I wasn’t looking at her nose!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay! It’s okay. It’s okay. It’s just—let’s go. Let’s not talk about it any more.
SEA:
So Magnus and Eggerton, you bump into Darcy as she comes to a stop because you have re-entered the glade again… and you smell your trail slowly diminishing ahead of you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
RRRR!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What is happening here?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It seems to me, as the leader of our group, that—
SEA:
(snickers)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It seems to me that, as the leader of our group—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes—that something weird is happening here, and we should probably, you know, figure out why that weird thing is happening. And then we can maybe find a solution to that weird thing happening. And then we can find Blat and then we can go home.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay, so what I say, as the not-leader of this group, but a very smart person, is that we go in the opposite direction of the direction we’ve been going. And then maybe this whole thing of coming up where we were before will stop happening.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, as the leader I endorse this action. Thank you, Advisor Number 2.
MARIS:
Darcy has already started off in the other direction.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, wait, wait, wait, here we come, here we come.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr rrrr!
SEA:
And you re-enter the glade again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
RRRRRRRR!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That was an excellent expression of rage, Bearcy. And it reflects how all of us feel.
So. What I can understand at this point is, we’ve all lost our minds collectively.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And that’s it’s… not good.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What if we just give up on this path altogether, and just step into the woods?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. You go first.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(nervously)
Fine. I’m gonna go first.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, go.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m stepping into the woods.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m waiting for you to step into the woods.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m walking into the woods.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m seeing you—you’re walking, but you’re not in the woods yet…
SEA:
It’s getting really dark as you step in.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(more and more nervous)
It’s getting really dark in here, but I am going into the woods! Is anybody with me?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Let us know what you see once you get a little further—
SEA:
You catch something, out of the corner your eye, zip across.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I just saw something!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Was it a rustling brush?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I don’t know! There was a sound… there was a rustling of something. I couldn’t see it—
SEAN (AS A SINISTER VOICE)
Come deeper, little one.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(whimpers)
Something just talked to me! It’s telling me to come deeper into the wood—guy, you’ve got to come in here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr rr rr rrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Okay. You keep going and report back… Recon Team Alpha.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr rrr rrrr rr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What, don’t—stop pushing me! Stop pushing me!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr rr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Fine. Okay, we’re coming, we’re coming.
MIK:
So we walk forward.
MARIS:
So we follow Magnus into the woods.
SEA:
You can’t find Magnus.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr? Rrr rr rrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know where he went.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr rrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. So I was not the one who said we wouldn’t go into the woods after him.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay. We’ll find him. We’ll find him. He’s…
SEA:
So Magnus, you’re still waiting for them to come after you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Guys!
SEA:
You can hear him.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay, okay—
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Guys?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, we’re coming! Where are you?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m right here!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr rrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We are also right here! Where are you?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m by some trees?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is it this tree?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I don’t know if it’s that tree! Where are you guys?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re next to some trees!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Which trees?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, it’s kind of brown. It’s got some leaves on it.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay. I’m looking at this tree. I’m looking at this tree really closely. Okay. Look, there’s, uh, there’s some moss at the bottom.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Uh… it looks like a pine tree of some kind.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, it’s the same tree I’m looking at.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Well, where are you? I can’t see you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t see you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Oh. You’re on the other side of the tree. I’m just going to go to the other side of the tree…
You’re not there.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, no, I went to the other side of the tree. I thought I was going to the other side of the tree and you were staying.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
No, no, no. I was coming to you. You just stay where you are.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’ll stay where I am and—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr rrr!
MARIS:
And Darcy starts to climb one of the nearest trees.
SEA:
Okay.
MARIS:
So I’m not sure how far grizzlies can go up a tree, but I’m gonna say maybe I get about halfway up a tree?
SEA:
You can go all the way up the tree.
MARIS:
Oh, there you go.
So I climb up the tree, and can I see anything now that I’m above the tree line a little bit?
SEA:
Yeah. So you see a small glade a few steps behind you. And then you see forest that extends as far as your eye can see in every direction.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(“Uh-oh.”)
Rr-rrrr.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay. So. You stay where you are. I’m coming around the tree.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Here I come.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right. I’m on the other side of the tree. Where are you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. I went to the left. Did you come to the right?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(sighs)
I went to the right! Just… stay still.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Just stay still and I’m coming around the tree.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait, where’s Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr rrr.
MARIS:
And I start coming down the tree.
SEA:
Okay. You don’t see either of them.
MARIS:
(laughs)
Oh, come on!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy, where are you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Okay. No. So I’m on the left side of the tree.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(grumbles)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Magnus is on the right side of the tree. Which side of the tree are you on?
MARIS:
And Darcy starts to shake the tree that she’s just come down, really hard.
SEA:
You both see the tree shake.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
RRRR!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. My tree is shaking.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
My tree is shaking!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(puzzled)
Rrr?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(laughing)
Okay.
BLA:
SEA:
Cut to:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(singing)
I’m not… losing my mind. I’m not… losing my mind.
See, the secret is, if you know that you’re sane, you’ll stay sane. And I have never felt more sane, despite the fact I don’t know where I am, I don’t know what direction I’m going in, and there’s a creepy voice that keeps interrupting me.
SEAN (AS A VOICE)
A creepy voice?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, a creepy voice! Something that just enters my brain despite me not knowing where it’s coming from or who the person is.
I’m going to assume it’s not disconcerting. Because it’s not. Because I’m sane.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
(actually more jovial than creepy)
Hm. You know, we don’t meet too many people wandering around in this here woods.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, because usually people wandering around in the woods is something that crazy people do!
(laughing nervously)
But I’m not crazy, and… how about you? Are you crazy?
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Uh… It’s a good question, actually!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah! You’re not sure!
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
No, I’m really not.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I guess I’m going to have to be in charge of this expedition.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
You could just come and have a seat here at my camp, though, if you wanted.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s tempting… I’m worried though, that if I turn around and look for you, that you’re not going to be there. And if you’re not… I’m going to start worrying that maybe I’m a little bit crazy.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
That’s quite the dilemma, actually. Yeah. Because if you don’t look, you won’t know if you’re crazy. Which might be better than knowing you’re crazy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Exactly. What if I ask you this…
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
What if I were to come around in front of you. Then you don’t have to move and you can just find out—would that be better, to find out secondhand that you’re crazy?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I like that. I like that. That’s better than what I was going to suggest. All right. I’m going to keep my eyes open, and continue staring ahead, and if someone, say in the next thirty seconds, should cross my field of vision, well then, I’m not crazy!
SEA:
So someone dressed in black slowly steps out in front of you, and then crosses across, off the path and then around behind you again.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Well?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughing even more nervously)
Well, there you were! I saw you!
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
You did?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yep, you’re you’re dressed in a black robe!
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Huh! Look at that. Maybe you’re not crazy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Maybe I’m crazy still.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well…
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Wait. I’m gonna stare straight ahead, and then you come around.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughing)
Oookay. I’m just gonna walk in a big circle, going behind me, and I should cross your field of vision.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Okay!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Right.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Keep them peepers open real wide!
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
I’m ready!
CARTE:
Blat walks in a circle, going around in the back of him, then goes back to his original position.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
I saw you!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You saw me!
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
I saw you!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay! Here’s what I’m worried about: You’re dressed in a black robe.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Yup.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s kinda creepy. So now I don’t think I’m crazy… but I am worried I’m in mortal danger.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
How about you? You saw me. What do you think?
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Well, you got big wings.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes!
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
I think you’re a demon…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes!
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
It’s a little disconcerting!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Aha! So we’re both on the same page.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
All right, well maybe if we just tell each other our names then we’ll know each other, and that might help!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay! My name is Blat.
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Okay. I’m called the Jolly Jester!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughing)
Okay! That’s not a proper name!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is that a nickname? Or a title of some sort? Is that your job?
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
I don’t know! What does that mean?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know! It’s your name, you tell me!
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Oh my God! What if I am crazy and I have a crazy name?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The Jolly… All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. We’ll simplify it.
You’re Jerry the Jolly Jester. All right?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
I got it. Jerry. Jerry the Jolly Jester.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Jerry the… okay.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yes! I got it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’re Jerry… and I’m Blat… and we’re both a little scared of each other.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yes!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now. Final question. When you walk around, does it seem like you keep walking into the same place that you left?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
No, that’s crazy!
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Dammit!
I am a little bit crazy. But does that mean that you then know how to get out of here?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Of course!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You do!
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yes!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay! Jerry the Jolly Jester, I am going to walk in a circle again walking behind me.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
When you see me, stop me… and then together, we’re going to leave this crazy wooded area. All right?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay, but wait! How do I stop you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You put your hand out! You put your arm out and you grab me. You grab my arm.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
All right.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Here I go, walking in a circle…
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Don’t freak out, because I’m going to grab you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, that’s… I’ll try not to.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Again, the robe kind of freaks me out a little.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
I can take the robe off!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… that might freak me out more.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Lower the hood.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yeah, okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just lower the hood.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
I can do that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay! Here we go, Jerry. I’m walking backwards, knowing that I will be grabbed at any moment.
SEA:
And a hand grabs you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(screams)
Aaaaa!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, I’m sorry, I know that that—
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Aaaa! I thought you weren’t going to freak!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I’m sorry! I just… It’s still a little…
(catches his breath again)
Okay, Jerry. Let’s just get a look at ya. What’s your head look like, Jerry? Let’s see.
SEA:
And as you turn to face Jerry, you see the hood has been dropped, but there’s just like a shadowy nothingness above the robe.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(terrified laughter)
You’re not helping me out here, Jerry.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
What do you mean? What’s the matter? I grabbed you! I grabbed you like you said.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, you did grab me, but you’re not a corporeal being!
SEAN (AS JERRY)
I am! I’m grabbing you right now!
SEA:
You see this shadowy hand wrapped around your arm.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Jerry, I don’t feel like you’re being completely honest with me!
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay? What can I do to fix this?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right… Jerry, look at me.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yeah, I’m looking at you. I’m looking at you! Can’t you see I’m looking at you?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sort of…? You see how I’m a physical being?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yes?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Look, I’m going to pinch my skin. Did you see that?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yeah?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m skin…
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay. Pinch me!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… Okay?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
All right.
CARTE:
So Blat pulls his fingers towards Jerry’s hand and tries to pinch him.
SEA:
It’s like a spongy feeling.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay…
SEAN (AS JERRY)
I’m feeling that! I’m feeling it!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, you’re sort of here… but you’re sort of not.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Oh yeah, I’m Shadowborn!
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s not helping me out, Jerry. You’re still kind of freaking me out. I don’t know what “Shadowborn” is.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Oh, it just means I’m born in the In-Between. We just call it the Between.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Between what, Jerry.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Oh, this is going to take a while.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So… is this like, Limbo? Is this Limbo, Jerry? Am I not in heaven and not in hell but—is that what this is?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
I’m not sure. I don’t think so but I’m not sure!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, to get out of the wooded area.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yeah!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is this like, maybe you live nearby? Maybe you could take me to where you live. Do you live nearby?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
You want to go to the Between?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(weakly)
Not really, but I don’t know what else to do, Jerry. I pissed off a goddess, and now I’m in the woods that don’t end, and I’m talking to you—do you have a face? Do you have…?
CARTE:
And Blat just waves his hand in front of Jerry’s head.
SEA:
His face follows your hand as you wave it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Like, you have the outline of a head but I’m not seeing any actual features. Do you have like, eyes and a nose?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
I thought I did!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m not seeing them, Jerry. I’m not seeing them.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay, well, let’s take a deep breath…
They both take a breath and let it out.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ahhh.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay. I can take you to the Between.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, the Between.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Or I can take you wherever you want to go. I think! As long as, you know, you didn’t piss off Celene or anything.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay. Jerry, you know how I mentioned earlier that I pissed off a goddess?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yeah?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay. Heh. Well, funny thing. Um… the goddess that I specifically pissed off…?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yeah?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Was probably Celene.
SEA:
Poof! He’s gone.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Dammit, Jerry!
MARIS:
(laughs)
DARCY, EGGERTON AND MAGNU:
SEA:
We return to Magnus standing next to a shaking tree, Eggerton standing alone next to a shaking tree, and Darcy, who is shaking a tree so hard it’s almost being ripped out of the ground.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. The tree’s got pine needles falling off of it now, right?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(affirmative)
Rrr hrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, okay. Do you see that, Magnus?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. So we all agree that the tree in front of us is shaking, pine needles are falling off of it; smells faintly of blueberries and salmon on the one side of the tree.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(affirmative)
Rrr hrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. So, what exactly is happening in that we are all around the same tree but we’re not around the same tree?
MARIS:
So I start to circle the tree. Do I bump into any objects as I circle the tree?
SEA:
You do not.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(frustrated)
Rr rrr rrrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Exactly. It doesn’t make sense. Now, the only thing that’s changed, to my knowledge, is that this young man here, who claims to be a monk, has arrived.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I wonder how much he might have to do with this weirdness.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?! What are you talk—I just want to—I want to get out of here just as badly as you do. Okay? And I don’t know what’s happening, but it’s obviously some kind of a magic thing that is happening right now, which is really cool, and I could I could probably appreciate it if I was in a different… But guys! I mean, come on! What are we gonna do?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gloomily)
Rrr rrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Me too.
SEA:
You hear a giggle.
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
Hee hee hee!
SEA:
And something zooms past you, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! I saw a thing! I saw—I think there’s a thing. I gotta go. Okay. Everybody follow me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrf?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
How are we supposed to follow you? I can’t see you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Follow my voice, then. I’ll find a way to talk more so you can hear me as I go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr hrr.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Fine. Fine. Go ahead.
MIK:
So I am following the direction the quick thing went.
SEA:
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay guys, so there’s somebody that went past me and there was a giggle or something, I don’t know what that was about…
SEA:
You hear a different giggle—
SEAN (AS ANOTHER FAIRY)
Hee hee hee!
SEA:
—go past you in a different direction.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! There’s another giggle. We’re shifting! 14 degrees starboard!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
14 degrees starboard?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What does that even mean?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s nautical. I think that as you age you will mature and learn about new things…
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
We’re not on a boat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that’s the direction it went in and that’s the direction we’re going now.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(sighs)
Fine. I’m just following your voice.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. It’s okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. So we’re going to keep going in this direction.
SEA:
And you see, in front of you, on a tree limb, you see a fairy floating.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
Do you guys see that?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There’s a fairy! And it’s flying. I didn’t know fairies could do that.
SEA:
And she sticks her tongue out at you—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
SEA:
And then disappears, zoom.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What! She just stuck her tongue out at me. Okay, I’m going, I’m going! Let’s go!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr hrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Up to 15 knots! Let’s move.
MARIS:
(laughs)
I start running after him.
JULIA:
Did we see that?
SEA:
Nope. Just Eggerton.
JULIA:
Only he saw that.
SEA:
Only Eggerton, sorry.
JULIA:
Okay, sorry, I just wanted to check in.
SEA:
Yup. Only Eggerton saw that.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What do you mean 15 knots?!
SEA:
And you hear Eggerton’s voice starting to disappear.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(urgently)
Rrr rrr rr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There’s a fairy, guys! We’re gonna get the fairy!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Slow down!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Come with me. It’s okay. We’ll get it! We’ll get it!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I didn’t see a fairy. Did you see a fairy?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrrr!
SEA:
And all of a sudden, the three of you are back. You burst out of the trees and are in a glade.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ohh.
JULIA:
Do we see each other yet?
SEA:
Yes, you do.
JULIA:
Okay.
SEA:
So all three of you burst into the glade and can see each other.
JULIA:
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(exasperated)
Rrrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey guys! I told you I’d get us out of the woods.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Ugh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
This better not be the same glade.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, once you’ve seen one glade, you’ve kind of seen all the glades, I think. But I feel that every experience we have can be seen as unique, no matter what. So if we keep that in mind, and with a positive attitude, this glade maybe is a different glade… and we’ll be okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr rrr rr rrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. No need for that kind of foul language, Darcy.
SEA:
(laughs)
JULIA:
I want to look for footprints or clear—the signs of places that people have traveled.
SEA:
Okay, so let’s roll Discern Realities.
JULIA:
I have 7… plus what?
MIK:
Intelligence, probably.
JULIA:
Oh, I have nothing.
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay. So you can ask one question, Magnus.
JULIA:
What do I see on the ground?
SEA:
You see the kind of tracks that would appear if a group of people had walked through this glade over and over and over again in different directions.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
God dang it! Look! It’s us! We’ve just been coming through this place like over and over and over again!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. So I saw a fairy and it was flying around—
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Of course you did!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? What?
SEA:
And a fairy settles down out of the trees.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look, there she is!
MARIS:
Can we see this?
SEA:
You can also see the fairy, yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There’s the fairy. I found the fairy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
What do you mean? I’m not the only fairy, fairy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But… no, I’m a fairy too. But you’re like a fairy fairy, fairy.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
No you’re a fairy fairy fairy, fairy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, “fairy fairy fairy fairy fairy” is not something that we talk about around other people.
SEA:
She sticks her tongue out at you again.
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
(blows a raspberry)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
Did you see the attitude?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
She’s not going to let you leave the glade. You might as well settle in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who’s “she”?
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
Well, I can’t say her name.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Stephanie?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
(sarcastic)
Yeah. Stephanie.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs wearily)
I knew a Stephanie once.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(disagreement)
Rrr! Rr-rrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No? Not Stephanie?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr-rrr!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh, you have a bear! I love bears!
SEA:
And the fairy zips around and lands on your shoulders.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr rrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are you a good fairy?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
I don’t know. Are you a good fairy fairy, fairy fairy?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Fairly.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Okay.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
He’s fairly a fairy? What is—what is…?! Who are you? Tell us how to get out of the woods!
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
She won’t let you leave the woods.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
And you won’t tell us who “she” is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Stephanie.
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
Stephanie.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Stephanie. Who is…?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr-rrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, sorry, sorry. I’m being told it’s Suzanne.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh no. Cel—
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
Don’t say the name!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(chastened)
Okay.
JULIA:
That’s right. That’s right, yeah! They mean Celene!
A sudden crack of thunder.
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
(screams)
SEA:
And this darkness rushes over the whole forest and glade, and the fairy just pops out of existence.
A little plink! sound.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr hrr hrr.
SEA:
And it starts to rain a very cold rain.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aw… dang it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(miserably)
Rrr-hrr-hrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. We should probably get under Darcy. She’ll keep us dry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And I stand up so they can crawl under me.
SEA:
Okay.
And are you guys gonna try and sleep or camp, or?
MARIS:
Yes. Sleep please!
MIK:
Yes, let’s make camp under Darcy.
MARIS:
(laughs)
But I can’t sleep!
MIK:
Yeah. Bears can…
MARIS:
Sleep standing up?
MIK:
Well, maybe on your side with like, a paw up in the air so there’s like an awning.
MARIS:
All right. So I collapse onto my side.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr.
The three squabble a while.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Don’t put that there!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Geez.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh sorry. That was my toe.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Just move over. Move over! I’m getting wet!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sneezes)
Sorry. Sorry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Ugh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think I’m allergic to bear.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
You really smell, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr? Rrrr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, I wouldn’t say that to her when she has the potential to roll and crush us.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right, fine. Just let me go to sleep.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(snores)
SEA:
And we slowly leave this clearing, as the three adventurers snuggle together in the cold fae rain.
MIDROL:
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of the End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey everyone. Sean here, and super excited to make a couple of announcements before today’s midroll promo. We are going to be at Hamilton Comic Con October 13 and 14. So if you are in the Greater Toronto Area, please stop by and say hi. It’s going to be myself, Eli and I believe Michael’s going to be there. We’re going to have stickers and all kinds of cool stuff.
Also, we want to make an announcement that we are going to be at PodCon in Seattle on January 19 and 20 of next year. So those are the two conferences coming up, and we hope if you’re in the area that you’ll come out and say hi.
And now, into our promo. Today I want to tell you about a show that I can’t stop listening to, and it’s called Spout Lore. It’s a tabletop live-play using comedy improv and the Dungeon World system. How crazy is that. Do you know how rare it is to find another comedy improv live-play that’s also using Dungeon World, just like we are? I can’t stop laughing when I press Play on any of their episodes. I feel like they’ve set the bar for improvisation and comedy in live roleplaying and we can’t get enough. Check them out at spoutlore.com and anywhere you listen to podcasts.
Music sting.
SEA:
Uh, guys? Four-minute call! Has anybody seen Darcy’s chocolate? Because it’s getting… we’re having some issues. She might be coming this way. I wasn’t here!
MARIS:
(dangerous)
Have you seen my chocolate?!
CARTE:
(tentatively)
I have not.
MIK:
Nope.
CARTE:
But… the person who’s a guest star may have. Don’t kill a continuing cast member.
MARIS:
(darkly)
Hello.
JULIA:
Hi Darcy!
MARIS:
Have you seen my chocolate?
JULIA:
I saw your chocolate, in the past tense… about 10 minutes ago?
MARIS:
What’s that on your lip? Is that… chocolate?
JULIA:
It might be?
MARIS:
RRRRR!
JULIA:
(screams)
Mayhem breaks out in the background.
SEA:
Keep us in chocolate supplies! Donate fast at patreon.com/albasalix!
CARTE:
Two dollars a month keeps us alive!
BLA:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Jerry?
Aw, come on, Jerry. I’m sorry I was a little bit freaked out that you’re Shadowborn.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
(hisses furtively)
What?! It’s not because I’m Shadowborn!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Really? You’re just hiding because I said her name?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
No, I’m hiding because you pissed off the ruler of all of this!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Look. Jerry, do you think it’s really fair that one person should have this much control over your life, and the trees and the glade and everything that’s this… I don’t know what?
I don’t. Which is why I stood up to her. Don’t you feel that maybe you should stand up to her as well?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Oh God, no! You did what?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well—
SEAN (AS JERRY)
(frantic)
I’m dead! I’m gonna be eviscerated! I’m going to be strung from every fae tree! Oh God, why do I talk to people?! Like my Mom said, don’t ever talk to people. Don’t talk to people! Certainly not people that aren’t Shadowborn. Can’t trust them! What have I done? Oh, friggin’ Jerry! My name’s not even Jerry!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, Jerry… You mentioned that this was a fae area?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Like… duh!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
“Duh.” Like I know!
I have a friend in my party. He’s also one of the fae. Do you think maybe he could be here, and maybe with a couple of my other companions…?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Oh, so I’m supposed to like, come out now because you know a fae? Everyone! “Oh I know a fae, I’m cool. I’m one of the cool kids. Hey hey hey!” Screw you! I don’t even know—whatever your name was, Bee Hop Bee Bor Blah Grrr… whatever it was!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Jerry… you said you were going to take me to the In-Between. Why can’t you just take me to the In-Between? Even though I did piss off the grand—
SEAN (AS JERRY)
I didn’t say that, did I?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You did! You said you’d take me.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
No! No I didn’t.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You did! You said you would take me!
SEAN (AS JERRY)
No I didn’t! No!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You said you would take me!
SEAN (AS JERRY)
(explodes in frustration)
NGGHHHHH!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Come on, Jerry! Be a pal.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
DOH!
All right. But then it’s not one step further. Not one step further!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Deal. Maybe my friends have wound up in this In-Between as well.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Between. The Between.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The Between. I’m sorry. It’s a proper noun.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We get there… Maybe my friends back in my reality could get me back somehow, because it’s—
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Yeah, that’s great. You can tell me the story on our way. Let’s go.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Going in Between. In between what, I’m sure I don’t know.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Okay, well, just walk where I walk.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And he steps out from a tree in front of you.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Come on!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, I’ll step where you step.
SEA:
And he starts slowly placing each foot forward.
CARTE:
Blat carefully puts each footstep in where he’s stepped.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
No!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Walk this way.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Walk…
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Bend your shoulders!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, I’m sorry. It’s hard when you’ve got giant wings! I normally have a shirt to keep them in check.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
And drag one foot.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Drag one foot…? I feel like this is an old comedy bit, but I’m going to go with it. Walk this way! Here we go. I’m a non-corporeal being who doesn’t actually have a face and walks with a limp.
SEA:
And the forest around you begins to shift a little with each step, like it just shimmers a little, and it shimmers more with each step. And all of a sudden, it just rushes at you… and you are in greyness.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouts)
Are we in Between, Jerry?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
(nervously)
Yes. You’re on your own. This is all I promised. This was it!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I just thought there’d be more to look at than just a colour.
SEAN (AS JERRY)
Oh, there’s a lot to look at. Be careful what you talk to here!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m talking to you, Jerry… Maybe you could tell me who I’m supposed to talk to?
SEAN (AS JERRY)
(breathing heavily, voice shaking)
You shouldn’t talk to me here either.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, Jerry, I’m gonna be honest. You’re a little less than helpful. I thought you were going to me a solid and—
SEAN (AS JERRY)
AAAAAGH!
SEA:
And Jerry launches at you, fangs growing out of this face… and roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
He has 1 hit point.
MIK:
He should have slept with the grizzly bear.
MARIS:
(laughs)
CARTE:
(rolling)
I had no grizzly bear to sleep with.
MIK:
“With which to sleep.” Please.
CARTE:
9 plus my Dexterity is a 10.
SEA:
Tell me what happens.
CARTE:
Jerry just keeps on moving past me.
SEA:
Because… can I see your sheet, Blat?
CARTE:
Certainly!
SEA:
Blat…
MARIS:
(whispers)
Is in Limbo.
SEA:
Is in Limbo.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhhh.
SEA:
And Blat, suddenly Jerry freezes, half-leaping at you and just starts moving, like in slow motion, and it’s as if you’re in touch with this space, like it’s under your control. As you move your hands, everything moves and he moves back. And then all of a sudden you’re just gone…
And you reappear in a glade beside a sleeping bear.
THE PARTY REUNITE:
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(snoring)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(quietly)
I don’t know how to do this without freaking them out. Oh well.
Hi everyone!
Everyone startles awake.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aaaa!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Sound machine! Wha—?
What happened to my pillow? I… had a body pillow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrr?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh sorry, that was your leg.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrrr.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ll wipe that off.
SEA:
And you see Darcy slowly starting to transform back, and shrink, vertebrae popping, fur sloughing back under her skin as the amulet around her neck begins to gleam.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ugh…
MARIS:
And I just collapse to the ground.
SEA:
And Darcy, Magnus and Eggerton, you are at, I think, full hit points.
MARIS:
Do I recover my spell?
SEA:
Yes. So you would relearn your spell, so you can reselect.
MARIS:
Ah!
SEA:
Blat, you are still at 1 hit point.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, sort of a good news / bad news situation… The good news is we found each other!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yay!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The bad news is, we’re in Limbo.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Awww.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aww!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now, bit of good news once again: I think because of my demonic background, I may have some control over Limbo.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yay!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Well, that’s great! So now just, let’s get out of here!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right… I’m not quite sure how to do that. Uh…
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m sorry, I’m new to the Limbo thing. I talked to someone named… the Jolly Jester who was a shadow person and said he was part of the In-Between. But then he attacked me. But that attack didn’t work. Because of my kind of sort of control of Limbo—all right. I have an idea.
Let’s all just gather the circle, hold hands and if I think really hard, maybe we can get back to our world.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat, you’re starting to sound a little crazy. And a little bit like Eggerton.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No! I had a conversation with the Jolly Jester. We were pretty sure that I was probably only a little crazy.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah, he’s lost it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, Blat, you look kind of tired and beat up. Why don’t you have a fairy cake, and we’ll sit, and we’ll have a little talk, and we’ll figure all of this out. Okay? As the leader of the group—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s my responsibility to make sure that you’re you’re on the up and up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m not sure if your fairy cakes are going to work in Limbo.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah, those things never work!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. But I think because there’s fairies around we’re probably in like a fae-related place, where the fairy cakes may have more potency.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat. Come here. Come over here.
MARIS:
And I lay my hand on Blat and I cast Cure Light Wounds.
SEA:
Okay, roll it.
MARIS:
And I roll a d8…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, no, Darcy! I don’t think this is the time for that!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Please, Darcy, not in front of the others!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
Oh, you ruined it.
It’s a 2.
SEA:
Okay, roll 2d6 for your spell.
MARIS:
I rolled a 5.
SEA:
You got +Wisdom on it, right?
MARIS:
Okay, so I get +2 then. Okay, “On a 7 to 9, the spell is cast but choose one…” So I have to… there’s a few things here. So I do cast it, and then as you say it’s revoked.
SEA:
Or you chose one of those other things.
MARIS:
Right. But I think—
SEA:
Then you don’t lose it.
MARIS:
“You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.”
SEA:
Sure, and then you keep the spell.
MARIS:
All right. So I’ll keep the spell then.
SEA:
You’re going to choose that one?
MARIS:
Uh… Yes.
SEA:
Okay. So you get 2 hit points back.
CARTE:
Huzzah!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, Blat, I think it’s really nice that she did her bit of trickery there, but come on, have a fairy cake. It’ll give you some pep. It’ll bring your focus in. We’ll be able to move forward.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. Here you go. This is a nice special purple swirly. Have that.
CARTE:
Blat takes a bite out of it.
SEA:
Roll Fairy Cakes.
CARTE:
That’s an 11!
MARIS:
Ooo!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhh!
SEA:
Roll what he gets.
MIK:
And he gets… 4 hit points back.
SEA:
4 hit points.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel four times stronger than I did before!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I told you that the fairy cakes worked.
SEAN (AS A DEEP BOOMING VOICE)
WHO’S DOING MAGIC?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(softly)
What was that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That—that—that was it—no. I…
SEA:
The ground beneath you begins to move.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Did anyone else have a fairy cake?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
No!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So the ground’s actually moving.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
SEA:
Yup. The ground is lifting up in the air.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aww, gee! What the heck?!
SEA:
And you’re all slowly starting to tumble off it as this giant rock starts coming out of the earth.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Whoa, whoa. I think what we’re on is alive.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Everyone off! Everyone off!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m getting off! I’m getting off!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m going, I’m going!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Solid ground! Get to solid ground.
SEA:
You all slide down to the ground. And these four legs start to pop out of this rock—pow, pow. And this head starts to lift up out of the front of this rock… and it is this gigantic creature with crazy big feet.
SEAN (AS A DEEP BOOMING VOICE)
WHO IS DOING MAGIC IN MY GLADE?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
He is!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no, that wasn’t—that wasn’t me…
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
This guy here! He’s the guy!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, it was her! It was her.
SEA:
And one of the big feet lifts up and starts to come down on Magnus and Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaa!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aaa…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Dive roll!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Roll away!
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay, you both roll. Defy Danger.
MARIS:
It’s a literal roll this time!
MIK:
Heyooo.
MARIS:
Hey ho.
MIK:
I got 8. No, 7.
JULIA:
11.
SEA:
Okay, so Magnus, what happens? How do you deftly avoid the whole thing with an 11?
JULIA:
Uh… I execute a perfect backflip completely by accident.
Laughter.
SEA:
And land with a “Tada!”
JULIA:
Yeah!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That was incredible.
SEA:
Eggerton, however, ends up getting one leg—he half-falls, half-slides out, and one leg is crushed underneath—
MARIS:
Ow!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaaa!
SEA:
—the giant foot coming down for 6 hit points of damage.
BOOOOM.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. I don’t want to look at it. How bad does it look? I don’t want to look.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It looks really bad.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, it hurts.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
That is terrible, man! That is—ugh! That is—I’m, I’m really sorry. I’m sorry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are you smiling?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m not smiling!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You’re smiling! I can see your teeth.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(guilty)
Nooo!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are you smiling? It hurts so much…
SEAN (AS A DEEP BOOMING VOICE)
NO ONE DOES MAGIC IN MY GLADE.
SEA:
And another foot starts raising up and over towards all of you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait! We’ll stop! We won’t do any more magic!
SEA:
Flying down, pushing down. Slamming down.
MARIS:
I dive out of the way.
SEA:
Okay, so Blat and Darcy, you need to Defy Danger.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(weakly)
Don’t let him fall on your leg.
MARIS:
I roll a 7, plus Dex, I guess? So an 8 for me.
Ooo! Nice.
CARTE:
9… so that’s a 10 for me.
SEA:
Okay. So Darcy, you stumble back, but get thrown by the impact and hit a tree and take 1 hit point of damage.
MARIS:
Ow.
SEA:
And… how does Blat manage to not get caught in this at all?
CARTE:
Blat just flaps his wings a little and moves backwards.
SEA:
Like blows himself backwards.
CARTE:
So Blat keeps flapping his wings and starts yelling for everyone,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Gather round Eggerton! He can’t walk! Gather around. We’re going to try to un-Limbo ourselves out of here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, I don’t know what that means.
SEA:
The giant head is slowly turning towards you all.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Everyone. Just hold hands! Grab Eggerton’s hand!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right!
MARIS:
I grab Eggerton’s hand.
JULIA:
I grab another of his hands.
Carter begins rolling.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, so here we go. I’m going to think really hard, think about my half-demonic past… see if we can get out of here.
SEA:
The giant mouth is opening, and it’s moving down towards you all.
CARTE:
I’ve rolled an 8, which means…!
“On a 7 to 9, you enter Limbo, but with a cost: you end up at a different location or plane, or you are unable to exit Limbo for ten minutes while you recharge.”
Let’s go to a different location or plane!
SEA:
And you all see the head and the mouth opening like so big, coming down, down, down, down. It blots out the sun…
Everyone screams.
SEA:
And then…
You’re all in greyness, holding hands.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This is… interesting. I thought there’d be, I dunno, some art or…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This is the In-Between. I know you’re gonna ask me “in between what”. I’m not entirely sure. But this is where I left Jerry.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Jerry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who’s Jerry?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Jerry the Jolly Jester. He’s a non-corporeal being. He’s Shadowborn.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
Remember, I think he’s a little crazy.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
He’s lost it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So can we do something about my leg that’s crushed? ‘Cause it kind of hurts and it’s floppy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe you should have a fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s a good idea. I’ll see if the fairy cake helps.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I could have given you a healing potion but some greedy-guts drank it earlier!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. That’s really terrible.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m gonna try a fairy cake.
MIK:
(snaps fingers)
11.
SEA:
Roll… roll—roll your Fairy Cakes.
MIK:
Roll, roll, roll your boat… Oh. 2.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
You get 2 hit points back. But your leg now can be walked on, it just hurts.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh… it’s okay. It’s a little sore. Hey, Darcy, do you think you could carry me for a bit?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! I’m not a bear anymore.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well. We all are a little bear inside.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(laughs)
Oh boy.
SEA:
And all of a sudden another being appears in the greyness around you, and you can see that each of you glows a little when you look at each other. And this being glows very brightly, and Eggerton may recognize it as the fairy from the glade.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
There they are again! It’s that fairy.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
There you are!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What are you doing here?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh, I was just running away. Who would ever do magic in that glade? That’s crazy!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I—
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
This guy would! This guy was doing magic.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, I didn’t—I didn’t do the magic! Darcy did magic.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. To be fair, it was me. I was doing the magic.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
(in awe)
Wow. I hope I’m as fearless as you are when I’m your age. How old are you? A hundred? You’re so big.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Two hundred?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Three hundred, actually.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Wow… that’s amazing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What was that thing in the valley, in the glade?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
The glade.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The glade. What was the… the big stone thing that tried to eat us?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
The glade.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, I see, it was the glade.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Yeah, the glade.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um, excuse me. Do you know how we get out of here, back to the world we came from?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Ohh… Celene’s put a price on all your heads.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You mean not not just the demon’s?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Let me check.
Another plink! noise.
SEA:
Poof! She poofs out of existence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Basically, I’ve learned, if you ask a question they poof out of existence and then don’t come back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s very frustrating.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I wonder if there is some kind of list somewhere operated by someone that has all this information.
A lengthy silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There was a joke in there and it didn’t come out.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, look.
I was able to get us out of danger from being eaten by parkland… so maybe if we all just hold hands again, and I think really hard, maybe I could get us back home. So… everyone huddle up again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay here we go.
Plink!
SEA:
And the fairy reappears.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Yeah! Hey.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Ah! There you are. I lost you for a bit. Yeah, it’s all of you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How much?
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
I’ll check. Hold on.
Plink!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait! Argh…
SEA:
And the fairy disappears.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know, Blat. All this popping in and out of existence—I don’t even know what you’re doing. Maybe we should just wait and this fairy can help us more.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We don’t know that the fairy is going to help us. The fairy is just finding out how much the fairy can get if the fairy brings our heads to Celene or something.
Plink!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
It’s a lot!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh. Well, that’s… nice to know. But what we’re trying to find out is, is there a way that we can get this bounty taken off of us?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
I’ll check!
Plink!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, it’s fine. I’ll continue standing here in the grey nothingness with you folks instead of trying to get us back to our plane of existence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Or you know, maybe grey nothingness again.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah, like… the choice between maybe getting out of here by your power that you don’t really know it works, and possibly getting help from a fairy? I’ll go with the fairy every time.
Plink!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Okay! Yes!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There is a way to get the bounty taken off?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
…wait, what?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You said yes, that that we could get this bounty taken off our heads?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh, was that the question? I forgot. I was sort of confused. I thought the question was, is there a way out of here?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, that’s the question too!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
I’m gonna go check the other one, hold on!
Plink!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! No! Wait—
(growls)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So what kind of mail were you delivering?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Well. Mostly it’s letters from the Monks to the Sisters and from the Sisters to the Monks, because, uh… we’re all, you know, chaste. So…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who’s chasing you?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Well, mostly our emotions, like lust? So these letters, well, they’re they’re kind of pornographic, and that’s how they they keep it all under control.
Plink!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Yes!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So hey. Could you tell us how we get out of here and how we get the bounty taken off?
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
I think so. It’s a lot…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, we’ll…
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Out of here? You could just follow me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, wait. Did you leave a fairy cake trail?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Let me check.
Plink!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Don’t ask any more questions.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Like what?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Never mind.
Plink!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
No, I don’t see any fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, here. Have one of mine.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
(glee, turning to puzzlement)
Oh! Oh… Wow, I’ve never seen one made like that.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, this is a homemade recipe.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
It’s really ugly.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Do not eat that!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What are you talking about? It’s a purple swirly! This is classic!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Do not eat that. Please do not eat that, please…
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh, I feel I want to eat it now…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You should eat it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
(stuffing her face)
Nom nom nom nom!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You didn’t—
(sighs)
SEA:
Roll Fairy Cakes!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We have nothing to barter with now!
MIK:
That’s an 11.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Not bad. Not bad. I’d a little more love, and maybe a little less—that was a very strange sweetener. What was that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It was applesauce. There was this one apple that kept talking back and I had to…
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Yeah, you need to cut it with something.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Oh, yeah.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
You know, maybe a little vinegar with the applesauce or—you know, just cut it a little?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ohhh. Yeah, that would be a good idea.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Actually, my friend here has one that tastes exactly as you described! And if you would like to have it…
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
No, it wasn’t that good.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(groans)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, may not have been up to your standards, but this is a pretty good fairy cake overall.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
It tastes like something that’s been sitting around for millennia or something.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I we could just focus a minute.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh, sure.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You said that we could follow you.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
I did?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You did say that.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Wow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But where would you be taking—
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Why would I promise that?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m not sure. But where would you…
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Fae never promise easily.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Where would you take us? It wouldn’t be into the hands of this goddess who’s offered a bounty—
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh, right! So I get all the money and all the jewels and all the cool things! Right! Yeah, so just follow me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hmmm. I’m a little suspect now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I am starting to think that they may not be a good fairy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I mean, on top of the delivering us to the—
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh, says the fairy fairy who can’t even make a fairy cake.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ooooo.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, you want to have a fairly fairy-off?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Ohhh? Yeah?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah? You want to go far away and have a fairly fairy-off?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Yeah, c’mon, let’s go!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Let’s go.
SEAN (AS A FAIRY)
Fly up here, let’s go!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…I can’t fly.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh, that’s sad. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make fun of you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve never been… Now I feel kind of guilty about—I’ve been eating a lot of fairy cakes.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Now I feel guilty.
Here. Do you want one of my fairy cakes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’ll try one of your fairy cakes.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Here. Here’s a special one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thanks.
(he eats)
That’s… that’s interesting.
SEA:
You are at full health.
And you see Eggerton start to lift into the air.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
(gasps)
There you go! Look!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s very tasty. And—what?
(gasps)
What…?
SEA:
And you fall back to the ground.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You almost flew, Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(breathless)
I almost… How did that happen?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I always had a theory that you’d be able to fly easily if you just weren’t shoving fairy cakes in your gob every three minutes.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Now, don’t you make fun of my friend!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, now that you’re friends, maybe you’d really like to help us!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
(thoughtful)
Oh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton can be a very good buddy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I already have a buddy. Darcy’s my buddy. That was already decided before.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You could be Eggerton’s second buddy…
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Okay!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I kind of like to think of Blat as my second buddy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gritted teeth)
You could be Eggerton’s fourth buddy.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Okay!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, actually, I think that’s Magnus here—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, he’s your third.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, my third buddy is the mixing bowl back in the kitchen.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(growls)
Eggerton…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay. So if you just get us out of here, back to where we came from, Eggerton will give you all of his fairy cakes and you’ll be able to go back to and tell Celene that we’re dead and then collect everything that she promised.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Okay!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wonderful. Now… you’re not going to just pop out of existence, right? Because we don’t know where you’re going. You have to physically take us to wherever you’re taking us.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh yeah. You just need to step where I step.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Step where you step.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, then!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Everyone ready?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, let’s walk this way.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Gotta get into line.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
What do you mean, “Walk this way”? That’s weird..
Okay, just step here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right…
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Then step here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yep.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh-huh.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Then you have to—I can fly but you’re going to have to jump to here…
They jump.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
And one more…
Plink!
SEA:
And you all pop in to a new glade that leads up to an immense palace.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, this is better, but this isn’t where we came from.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
(sadly)
Sorry, I didn’t have a choice.
MARIS:
Does that immense palace have any moon things around it?
(laughs)
SEA:
And there is a blue gleaming light coming down from the palace.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(groans)
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Come on…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No fairy cakes for you! Not a one! Not a single fairy cake for you.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Okay…
SEA:
And she pops out of existence.
Plink!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton! I never thought fairies were so traitorous!
Celene’s voice suddenly booms out.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Let’s speak about… traitors.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.

And Jerry launches at you.

Jerry just keeps on moving past me.

Because…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Because of my demonic background, I may have some control over Limbo.

WHO IS DOING MAGIC IN MY GLADE?

He is!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no, that wasn’t—that wasn’t me…
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
This guy here!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Everyone. Just hold hands! We’re going to try to un-Limbo ourselves out of here.
An eerie whoosh.
SEA:
You’re all in greyness, holding hands.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Celene’s put a price on all your heads.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Here. Do you want one of my fairy cakes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thanks.
SEA:
And you see Eggerton start to lift into the air.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You almost flew, Eggerton!

CELENE’S PALAC:
SEA:
The four of you were standing and staring down at basically Celene’s palace with the fairy in the air near you, when suddenly you are all standing in front of the palace doors.
An ominous choir sings.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oohhh!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That escalated quickly.
SEA:
And they are slowly opening. These are very strange, large palace doors that are all kinds of faces and grotesque figures, as if they are built out of different beings that have been trapped forever inside them. Very lifelike… assuming they were carved, ever. And these giant gates are slowly opening, and you hear the sounds of what must be five thousand fae inside the hall, all talking and murmuring as these doors are opening before you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
It’s just like her scary chariot. I don’t want to go in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I would have expected a portcullis.

ANNOUNCE:
The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy roleplaying game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your Game Master is Sean Howard, with players Marisa King, Michael Howie and Carter Siddall, and special guest Julian Sark. Episode 14: Between, Part 2.
SEA:
As the gates widen, a bird-like being steps out in very long flowing purple robes. Except there’s a typewriter where its head should be. And it steps forward and clackity clackity clacks and you see some words appear on the paper where the head is. It says: “ENTER.”
CARTE:
Blat leans forward.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know if this is the right custom to do. I’m just going to try something.
CARTE:
And types out: “THANK YOU” on the keys.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Don’t type that!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I don’t know…! It’s got a typewriter for a face! Is that what I’m supposed to do? I’m sorry, is this bothering you? Am I touching your nose or something?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
The thing you want to type is “NO”!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! All right.
CARTE:
So Blat starts hitting the back key.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll just… all right. So I’ll type an X over each letter of “THANK YOU” and then capitalize—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You need to scroll down the paper first.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I’m sorry.
CARTE:
(mimics the crunch of a typewriter roller)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think you should say “Thank you but no.” That’s more polite.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, that’s more polite. Sorry, could you just hold still, bird-typewriter being? Just a moment. So, all right…
(clears his throat)
“Thank you, but no. We rescind your generous offer of entry—”
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
There’s a typo on “rescind”.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh. How do you spell “rescind”?
SEA:
The doors hit their widest open point with a resounding sound through the hall. And there is a hush now. The entire hall is quiet as Blat continues to try and type on this being’s head.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, so R‑E-S‑C…
SEA:
The paper advances. It’s like, “IF YOU WILL PLEASE STOP” types out on the paper.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh. I was worried that this was considered rude. I’m sorry. Can you hear us, typewriter being?
SEA:
“I’VE NEVER”—types out on the next line… and that’s when you realize the entire hall is quiet, and you just feel all the eyes from this hall focused on you all standing in the doorway.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So what if we all take three steps back? All together… and we’ll just keep doing that all the way down the hill.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Very good. Casually… casually. Don’t make it seem like you’re walking backwards like, “Oh hey look at that statue over there! That’s interesting.” Take a step back.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m just transferring my weight back on my heel, just like this.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Absolutely. Ooo! Take a look at that over there. That’s quite lovely. Take a step.
SEA:
And Blat, your back hits a wall that wasn’t there and the wall grumbles.
SEAN (AS THE WALL)
Excuse me!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m terribly… sorry? Heh… I’m sorry, are you a wall?
SEAN (AS THE WALL)
What do I look like?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A wall?
SEAN (AS THE WALL)
Well, I’m probably a wall. You got a problem with that?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t have a problem per se that you are a wall. I was just wondering if perhaps you could be a wall somewhere else. We’re just trying to leave.
SEAN (AS THE WALL)
Well, I’m just going in.
SEA:
And the wall begins to advance forward.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Hey!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay! So we’re moving forward. So we’re moving forward. Heh. Excuse us, typewriter being—
SEA:
The typewriter slaps you across the face and stalks off.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Aaaaa!
All right. Celene lives in a very trippy castle. But! We have an ace in the hole! We’re in a castle of fae and we have a fae amongst us!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who’s that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Darcy has a little bit of fae on her great aunt’s—IT’S YOU.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Yeah, I knew that. Okay. Ahem. So…
Excuse me, everybody! I would like to petition for uh, exit to another place because this is, as I have been told, creepy AF, and we don’t want to be here any more thank you.
SEA:
The wall stops behind you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! See, it worked.
SEA:
And there’s a slight murmur rolling forward in the crowd away from you.
SEAN (AS VOICES IN THE CROWD)
(whispering)
He wants to get out. He wants to leave. He wants to exit. Why…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. So I think this is going well. Um… We’ll just. Excuse me Mr. Wall, if you wouldn’t mind walling elsewhere?
SEA:
And the wall disintegrates into blocks that all start running around and running off into the crowd.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That was a little terrifying. But look! I fixed it as your leader—
SEA:
As the giant door slams shut behind you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um. So… the wall problem has been resolved, with nightmarish results. However, it would appear that the doors are not cooperating. If someone else has an idea of how to open the doors and/or progress away from this upsetting incident, I am open to ideas.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, here’s my question: is this still Limbo? Or the In-Between? Because if it is, perhaps I could use my new demonic whatchamacallit to get us out of here. Huddle up everyone!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Huddle huddle huddle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’ll give this a try. Everyone hold hands! I’ll think really hard, and perhaps we can just magic our way out of here.
SEA:
All right. Roll for Limbo Travel.
CARTE:
Rolling for Limbo Travel.
That is a 7! “On a 7 to 9 you enter Limbo, but with a cost: you end up in a different location or plane; or you are unable to exit Limbo for ten minutes while you recharge.”
I choose: “end up at a different location or plane”! Possibly the one where we came from!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This seems oddly familiar to me, everybody.
A DIFFERENT LOCATION OR PLAN:
SEA:
Okay, so you’re all huddled up around Blat… when all of a sudden everything starts to get really dark, like you’re going blind. The colours are changing, things are pulsing and everything sounds really dampened. And you hear another murmur and in the hall, this time louder, rushing away down ahead of you in the audience…
The eerie whoosh of limbo travel.
SEA:
And you disappear and you are floating in the void.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sarcastic)
This is much better.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, no one’s going to try to kill you because there’s no one here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’ll just cease to exist after millennia floating here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know about that. I think we’ll always be here. Whether we’ll be alive, I don’t know, but I truly believe that our physical forms will still exist in whatever this non-place is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look, I can do a somersault in the air!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oooh! Very good.
SEA:
So you are floating in the blackest of black. There is no light, yet you can sort of see each other, sort of in an outliney kind of way. And there is nothing. And sound sort of exists; you can sort of hear each other, but it’s like it just falls off pretty quickly, as if underwater.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I kind of want to be back in the castle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m worried that the distance of the castle are going to do something awful to us.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Do you know why they’re gonna do something awful to us?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes! I know why! Because I did not promise the magical tree to the evil goddess of the moon. This is all my fault. I’m trying to make it better! Hence we’re floating safely in… a void of blackness.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Where we’re probably going to die. Take me to a different place! Please! Wherever it is, other than where we currently are! And plus… you angered a—she’s a goddess! You can’t come back from that! That is not something you come back from!
(reconsiders)
Actually, I think I’m good. I prefer to stay here in the void. No good can come from going back there!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes! Exactly! Which is why I put us in the void! We’re safe in the void. Sure, we’ll eventually go insane from boredom and then starve to death. But still, it’s probably better than what she was going to do to us because oh! I didn’t want her to be in charge. Loxsyn! Loxsyn is the goddess of choice!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Oh no. We’re not going to starve to death, because we’ve got his fairy cakes that never work!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
They’re still filling.
SEA:
(laughing)
Cut to an hour later, floating in the void.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sings)
97 bottles of mead on the wall. 97 bottles of mead. I take one down and drink it alone ’cause I’m sad and I haven’t seen the sun and I’m really questioning whether or not this was a wise decision and my friends stopped talking to me and now it’s just kind of dreary and lonely… 96 bottles of mead on the wall.
No one else says a word. Mike starts to crack up, but soldiers on.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
96 bottles of mead on the wall, 96 bottles of mead…
Oh gods. Where is everybody? Why won’t you talk to me?
(sobbing)
I don’t like it here any more!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You see? You see what you’ve done, Blat?! Even Eggerton, who is the most annoyingly cheery person I’ve ever met, is completely depressed. He doesn’t even want to go on living. Well, I mean he’s going to go on singing that song, but I mean, I don’t think he wants to go on living anymore. I feel like you’re not consulting us in your decisions anymore. You single-handedly decided to defy Celene. You single-handedly decided to bring us here to a void. Maybe we could all decide on things as a team. Except you, Magnum you’re not really part of the team now. But I feel that this has probably not gone very well for you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
My name is Magnus. Magnus!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! Sorry about that. Magnus. Yeah. Sorry this hasn’t gone too well for you here, has it. Heh. You were just delivering mail. It’s kind of funny and now you’re in a void somewhere…
Anyhoo! Um… we need to get out of here. Because I can’t take him singing that anymore.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(slurring drunkenly)
94 bottles of mead on the wall… but there’s no walls in a void, I want to drink a mead but can’t because there’s no walls… 93 bottles of—
SEA:
There’s no light, but… it’s like a shadow passes over all of you. Like something the size of a planet has just narrowly missed you all. And you just get this strange sense of foreboding.
MARIS:
More foreboding than being in a void with him singing “96 Bottles of…”? Okay.
SEA:
Almost like you could feel the rumble of something passing that you couldn’t hear.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Sorry guys, I’m a little hungry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think it was you. I think there’s something bigger out there.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I don’t think I can take any more foreboding.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. There’s a lot of foreboding.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, the only thing that I would suggest is holding hands and Limboing again.
Groans of protest from the party.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, exactly! Because now we have to talk about it. Quit making decisions for the group, Blat! Quit trying to improve our situation, Blat! We need to have a vote! Well, let’s just write down on secret little cards what we want to do.
Look! We either go after the planet-sized… foreboding, or we try to blink our way into someplace else!
SEA:
A giant whiteness opens up, filling all of your vision, all of you. And it takes a second to realize it is a giant eye and it is slowly tracking on you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(whimpers)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s terrifying.
SEA:
And you feel another rumble.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Unilateral! Unilateral. Let’s unilateral it up. Let’s go go go!
Come on Blat! Unilateral! All you, buddy. Let’s do it. Buddy number 3.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! No! I will try something. Here.
(shouts)
Excuse me! Excuse me! Is anybody there.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, this is going to work great. Talk to the giant eyeball!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Big eyeball?
SEA:
The eyeball shifts slightly, as if it was looking at Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… Hello! Hello, Giant Eyeball. Nice to meet you. Uh… my name is Dar—
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
FOOOOOOD.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, that’s not good.
Uh, Eggerton, do you have any fairy cakes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t think I have any that big.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe we could just give it something small.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay okay. I’ll take one out. Here’s—this is a nice green cube one.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Throw it a little bit below the eye.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
A little below the eye.
SEA:
A line, way down from this eyeball, a red line is starting to form. Quite large.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The red line. Aim for the red line.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Here we go! And—whooof! Oh look, it’s floating.
SEA:
(laughs)
Let’s roll Volley in the void.
MIK:
All right.
(sings)
Volley in the void… That is a 6.
SEA:
Do you have a Dex bonus?
MIK:
I do not.
SEA:
Okay. So. Egerton sends a little fairy cake tumbling off into the void, and you see the red line getting bigger, opening up as if it might be a giant mouth.
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
FOOOOOOOD.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Hey, listen. You’re huge. We’re tiny! We’re not even going to fill you up. You’re gonna be even hungrier!
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
SOOOO HUNGRY.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(whimpers)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I feel like this is a good time to just cut our losses.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
No, no, don’t say it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Let’s—let’s hold hands…
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(groans)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And here, I’ll hold both your hands, Magnum, and we’ll get ready to go, because the mouth is getting bigger.
SEA:
It is filling all of your vision now, this redness. All you see is red, as if it’s approaching.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Wait, wait, wait! I know where you can get lots of food! Lots of food. We just came from there! Celene’s castle! It’s filled with fae! It was like there was a thousand of them there—and they’re just waiting! Just waiting to be eaten!
SEA:
The redness is receding.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Interesting.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Now… Blat. Can you touch this thing, hold on to our hands… and try to limbo us back to the castle so this thing can eat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s an excellent plan.
(turning sarcastic)
But I don’t know if I can do it because we have to check with Darcy. Would that be all right with you, Darcy? We came up with a plan but we didn’t ask you about it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I feel like I’m being forced into this. But yes, I’ll agree. Rather than being eaten.
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
FOOOOOOD.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Ack! You better do this now, Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. All right. Everybody hold hands and I’ll just…
SEA:
You’re a little too far away from each other right now to hold hands.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m going to swim over to Darcy.
SEA:
It seems to be working.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, it’s working!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I gotcha.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay okay okay okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I gotcha. Let’s swim over towards Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m flapping my wings.
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
NOOO TRICKS.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No tricks! He speaks the truth. There’s a castle. There’s a lot of stuff in it. A lot of stuff. I’m just going to—I don’t want this to hurt. I’m just going to wrap one little hand around an eyelash… Good? Good. Is everyone okay back there?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Take my hand. And now—the thinking.
SEA:
(laughs)
There is so much riding on this roll.
Carter begins rolling.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thinking—thinking—thinking—not knowing how this is going to work—dear lord in heaven, how large is this being?
Whoosh.
CARTE:
8!
Laughter.
CARTE:
“You enter Limbo, but with a cost. You end up at a different location or plane!”
SEA:
What are the options? Different…
CARTE:
“You are unable to exit Limbo for ten minutes while you recharge.”
Silence.
SEA:
(laughing)
You’re sort of in Limbo.
Okay, so I’m gonna say… um… dear lord. I need to read this.
CARTE:
(laughs)
We broke the game!
CARTER AND JULIA:
We broke the game! We broke the game!
MARIS:
Carter broke the game again.
CARTE:
We broke the game!
MIK:
And that’s the end of Season 1, folks! Thanks for tuning in.
Laughter.
MIK:
We’ll be back when Sean checks out of Ward 5 of the mental hospital.
CARTE:
I like how essentially we are now in Quantum Leap.
Laughter.
MARIS:
Yeah, how do we think we’re going to get back to the place?
MIK:
Sliders.
CARTE:
Sliders!
MARIS:
We’re just gonna go to Limbo again. Why did you think we could bring us back.
SEA:
I have it.
MARIS:
Oh, we’re in trouble.
SEA:
The world explodes into all of your senses… and Blat, you are holding on to this beast of such size and scope you can’t even see it. And all of you are hanging off of Blat. And around you is sort of a colourless plane and rocks and craters, and off in the distance there’s very everything’s very bright, and you see a small globe in the sky, pretty large, that appears to be a distant planet. And all of you are on the moon.
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
HUNGRYYY.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. There’s been a slight problem with our location, but as you can see—
SEA:
And you can’t speak because you can’t breathe.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
SEA:
And there is no oxygen.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(protracted gasping)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(strangled)
Rolling! Rolling! Just hold on to me! Rolling…!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(still gasping)
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(still gasping)
It’s a 7! We have to go to a different plane because we can’t stay here to recharge!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe you can let go of the eyelash!
SEA:
And you all pop out of existence.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(groans)
SEA:
And you appear in…
Uh, so no—here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to play a game. So from 1 to 6, we’re going to go around the table. I’m going to write numbers until we get them. We’re going to come up with six planes, because we’re probably going to be doing this for a bit.
Laughter.
SEA:
So we’ll start with… Magnus! What’s a place or a plane.
JULIA:
747!
MARIS:
…what?
JULIA:
It’s a plane.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIK:
Boooo.
SEA:
(writing)
So modern day… Yup. A plane of existence?
MIK:
Celene’s castle.
SEA:
(writing)
Such a cheater. Okay, Celene’s—the land of the fae.
JULIA:
(whispers)
Why would you want to go back there?!
SEA:
Eli? Number three?
EL:
Uh… The hell dimension of Qwaytox.
SEA:
Thank you.
CARTE:
(laughs)
SEA:
Eli has said: the hell dimension of Qwaytox. I’m going to pick the Land of Death. Marisa?
MARIS:
The land of sugar plums and jujubees.
SEA:
Love it. Carter!
CARTE:
Uh… Eggerton’s kitchen.
SEA:
(laughing)
Oh God!
MARIS:
How is that a plane?
SEA:
It is a plane. I’ll give it. It is not of this world. Okay. Marisa! Roll us a six-sided die, please.
MARIS:
It’s a 4!
SEA:
The Land of Death.
MIK:
Oooo.
MARIS:
I’ve been there.
SEA:
(laughs)
You might actually complete your mission. Okay, so…
THE LAND OF DEAT:
Whoosh. A soft, ethereal wind.
SEA:
You all pop back into existence, and everything is weird. It’s as if the world is is planarly flat. Every direction you look, there is just mist leading up to a tower in the distance, no matter where you turn. And you are now all falling towards the ground hanging onto this giant void-beast. But you never stop falling. You’re always in the same place, falling towards this misty floor, with always a tower in the distance, no matter where you turn.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This looks really familiar.
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
FOOOOOOOD.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’re slowly moving backwards. If we keep this up, we may eventually get home.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. No, we’re stopping here. We’re stopping here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! All right. We’ll stop here. Well, tell me, what sort of lives are we going to lead here in our new home? Tell me! What’s your plan? What’s your plan? Because I seem to be forever falling, with the world’s most giant creature hovering above me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Throw me some of your fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, here you go.
SEA:
I need a roll for Volley! You guys are falling, hanging on to each other and tossing each other fairy cakes.
MIK:
That’s a 7.
SEA:
Okay. So you lose all your fairy cakes from your pouch. They’re just falling down towards the ground, but two of them make it to Darcy. So you have no more fairy cakes until you can get to a place to cook or eat or sleep.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… Mr. Death! Mr. Grim Reaper! Fairy cakes! Fairy cakes! Do you remember me? Hello?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Death?
(laughs)
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
You’re calling for Death?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re kind of old friends.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
WHAT?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I owe him a favour.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You owe Death a favour?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How do you think I got alive again? You think it was that guy’s… ministration and surgeon’s skills?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(gasps)
You lied to us! You said you were a medical expert!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I didn’t say that! I said that I know a little bit about it, that’s all I said! But you put it on me. You said I had to save her! I—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You did have to save her! And do you know why you had to save her? Because I love Darcy! There! I love Dar— ohh, what did I just say as I’m falling down here in the Death Plane.
Silence.
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
FOOOOOOD.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No one heard that! Everyone—what I just said was drowned out by the giant monster who demands food.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So… Death? Grim Reaper? Hello?
MARIS:
And I’m waving my arms in the air with these fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I never thought I’d be so uncomfortable plummeting forever downwards with a giant coming at me.
It’s kind of awkward now.
A prolonged silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Just like that. Very awkward.
Laughter.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Listen. You’re going to bank our success or failure on those freakin’ fairy cakes?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, how else are we going to stop the falling? We’re just gonna keep falling forever!
SEA:
And you’re no longer falling. You’re all suspended, just frozen.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know if this is better or worse.
SEA:
And you hear a voice, Darcy. I think you all hear it—and it’s somebody talking with their mouth full.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
I didn’t think you’d do it, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But I did! I brought you the fairy cakes!
SEA:
And in front of all of you materializes… Death. In the robes with the hooded cowl, and holding a scythe in one hand, and seems to be eating something with the other.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
That is so cool.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Well, Darcy you’ve delivered. In fact, you’ve inundated me with fairy cakes. They’re scattered across the plane here.
I did not expect a Galactopoid from the void, however.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, is that what that is? Heh. I thought maybe you would need a Galactopoid for your collection.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
I don’t believe it is the Galactopoid’s time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh. That’s too bad.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
And it seems to be very hungry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. We’ve had a problem with that.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
This guy wants to eat us.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
I don’t—I just wanted to eat a fairy cake.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
No, no, no. The Galactopoid. He’s all hungry and he’s gonna eat us. So… is there anything you could do about that, maybe, just to help us out? I mean, you’re friends with Darcy? So you know, you probably want to help a friend out. That’s what friends do, right?
SEA:
Suddenly the cowl is right in front of you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aaa!
SEAN (AS DEATH)
You’re asking to make a bargain with Death, young—
(sudden recognition)
Oh! Magnus.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What? You know my name?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
(chuckling)
I know everyone’s name. I have a ledger here somewhere.
SEA:
And a ledger appears in his hand and he’s reading it.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Very interesting.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Well… yeah, you know, I’ve led a pretty cool life, so far, I mean for somebody who’s so young. But uh… yeah, sure! Let’s, let’s, let’s just make a bargain, you and I!
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Okay.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Yes.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What do you want?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Well, it depends what you were asking for, young Magnus.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What I’d like…
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Uh huh.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Is for you…
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Uh huh.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
To make this Galactopoid go away, and… return us to the tree.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Really, Magnus. You have one chance to make a pact with Death, and that’s really what you’re going to ask for?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(sighs)
Well… that’s my immediate need. I mean, there are other things I would like, like you know, I would really love to be an all-powerful superbeing who could do really cool martial arts and like, save the world…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But he’ll settle for the Galactopoid.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
But I’ll settle for the Galactopoid!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And some more fairy cakes.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(sighs)
And some more fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, oh, and I lost my noise-making thing that I like at night—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Eggerton, he’s making a deal with Death.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but I—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe just shhhh. Just shhh.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
So how many years are you willing to give me, Magnus? Early?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Uh… Give you years?
(grimaces)
Can we…
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Remember, you don’t even know how few you have.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
True… true.
Guys, uh, help me out here. What should I do—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
He’ll give you 17 years.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No—Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? I’m just trying to move this along. I’m getting uncomfortable with the floating, I’m getting some chafing, and I really just want to go back to the tree so we can all sit down and relax for a bit. 17 years for all of the things he said—let’s do it.
SEAN (AS DEATH)
It is done!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! No!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But he doesn’t even have any awful habits yet! Like smoking, or an addiction to crass reading material!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Uh, he actually has both of those.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What?!
SEAN (AS DEATH)
(chuckling)
However… Magnus, you can’t make a deal with Death. It doesn’t work like that. Ah, the look on your face!
We’ll meet again, Magnus. Darcy, thank you. You have satisfied the first part of our bargain.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The first part?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
Now, if you could just take your Galactopoid from the void and move along, that would be great.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You… you don’t want him here?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
No. It’s not his time. But when it is this time I’m happy to make a deal. Same as you, Magnus. But it is none of your time. I’m amazed you even got here. Very interesting.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What about, to get rid of us, you send us back to Celene’s Palace with the Galactopoid, and then you’d get rid of us all. Would that be useful?
SEAN (AS DEATH)
You know I remember when people were afraid of Death. It was such a better time. You know, everyone was just afraid of me…
His voice fades away to nothing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It makes you feel better, I am presently terrified.
SEA:
(laughing)
Death disappears. But you’re still floating in the mist, and everywhere you look there is a tower off in the distance.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we have to take Galacty with us.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(groans)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Otherwise Death is going to be real mad.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
He’s so personable. I don’t know why he thinks that we’re gonna be afraid of him. Anyway… we could try to kill this Galactopod, then maybe Death would come and take—
SEAN (AS THE GALACTOPOID)
(a massive roar)
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I mean—we could try to massage this this Galactopoid and make him really happy!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we better’d get off the Death Plane, first of all. I don’t think it’s going to end well. Limbo us out of here, Blat—is there any chance we could get back to Celene’s Castle? That’s what I want to know. Or do we just limbo on forever?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh well, let me try my Limbo Handbook here—I don’t have one! I don’t know how this works! Everyone, just grab a hold and… Galacty? Is it all right if I refer to you as Galacty.
SEAN (AS THE GALACTOPOID)
(rumbles)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, very good. Thank you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now remember, if we can make it back to Celene’s castle, there’s all sorts of good stuff in it to eat.
SEAN (AS THE GALACTOPOID)
HUNGRY.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I understand, Galacty, yes. It’s been a while since I’ve had something nourishing, myself. So! Onesy, twosy, apples and pears, what is the present thing that we’re going to be trapped in?
He rolls.
Whoosh.
CARTE:
8!
Laughter.
CARTE:
“You end up in a different location or plane!”
MARIS:
Shocking.
SEA:
(laughing)
Roll a six-sided die, Darcy.
MARIS:
It’s a 1.
SEA:
Modern day.
MIDROL:
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of the End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey everyone. Sean here, and I want to thank you all for being with us on this amazing journey. Quick note that this episode—Episode 14, the one you are listening to right now, the one where the entire table chanted “We broke the game”—is the last episode for a little while. We’re gonna be taking just a short break while we roll out Alba Salix, Season 2. Or as Eli is calling it Alba Salix, Volume 2. So just keeping in mind there’s gonna be a short break before we come back with our next episode.
That said, I also want to promote where you can come and meet us and see us. Eli and I will both be at PodCon in Seattle on January 19th and 20th. Please stop by if you’re in the area, say hi—we’re going to have some super awesome things to give away, and also at our table. Finally, it’s time for our mid roll promo. This week, we have a special audio clip to play for you from an awesome podcast, a live play podcast that we really enjoy and we love, and you may have heard of it. It’s Tales from the Dark Dragons Inn.
Moody music plays.
PROMO NARRATO:
Cities are hard. They’re tangled webs of shadows with someone different waiting to stab you in the back on every corner. Baldur’s Gate ain’t no different. If anything, it’s worse. There’s murder in the air, and a name on everyone’s tongue that no one dares to speak. The scales of justice are new in town, hot on the tail of an evil cult. But they’re going to make him talk.
PROMO ANNOUNCE:
Tales from the Dark Dragons Inn is a serialized fiction podcast. Join us for Season 2 on tftddi.co.uk.

MIDROLL: GOING ON BREA:
SEA:
Mike! Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.
MIK:
Yeah, what’s up?
SEA:
All your stuff’s gotta be in boxes. We’ve gotta be out of here.
MIK:
What are you talking, in boxes?
SEA:
We’re going on break! We’re not paying for the studios while we’re on break.
MIK:
Well, I’ve got a lot of stuff here, and some of it’s kind of hidden.
SEA:
What do you mean hidden? Like, where where’s all this stuff coming from? Your trailer is tiny.
MIK:
Yeah, well, it’s not just the trailer. I might have, you know… Let’s go look at Marisa’s trailer. Walk over here.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
Now you see that—
Sean knocks on the door.
SEA:
Darcy! Marisa!
MARIS:
What do you want.
SEA:
Hey, I just wanna make sure you’re all packed, because we’ve go to be out of the studio at the end of recording today.
MARIS:
Wait. Do I have to pack all Mike’s stuff that’s also in my trailer?
SEA:
What do you mean, his stuff?
MIK:
You know about it?
MARIS:
Uh, you paid me 20 dollars the other day to take over three-quarters of my trailer.
MIK:
Oh, no no no no. Not that stuff.
MARIS:
Oh.
MIK:
The stuff I hid.
MARIS:
I don’t know what he’s talking about.
MIK:
Okay, okay, come over here to the little sink.
(straining)
Just… lift that out and put it down here and yeah, see—there’s the magazines.
MARIS:
Oh no.
SEA:
Oh no.
MIK:
These are these are my favourite cooking magazines. And people get really judgy because they think I could probably lose a few pounds, so I try not to read those around the press. So I’ll take those and put them in my bag…
SEA:
You’re going to take all this stuff one trip at a time in your backpack?
MIK:
Yeah.
SEA:
Please send money so Sean doesn’t go insane. You can do so at patreon.com/albasalix.
MIK:
I’m pretty sure they can just go to otherbothers.com if they want, too.
SEA:
Security! Security!
MIK:
Aw, come on.
SEA:
We need you to please take him and bring him again…
FALLIN:
Whoosh.
A fierce whistling wind.
SEA:
You are suddenly in clouds. And a brilliant bright blue sky and a very too-bright sun, and you hear this roar that’s like sound of some kind of engine approaching. And you are floating—or perhaps in freefall—in the clouds.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are we going so fast?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouting)
Oh, it’s very simple. We’re plummeting to our doom.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aw, geez!
SEA:
With a giant-sized void creature that you are hanging onto, as you hear the sounds of the engine getting louder.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What—what—what’s that sound coming from?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I see a dot, and—oh! The dot appears to be getting larger.
SEA:
And you see what looks to be some kind of moving vehicle with wings… and it is getting faster and faster, approaching you.
And it begins to fire.
And you just hear the sound as all these projectiles are, like, zinging through the air all around you. Everyone roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
Wha…?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think it’s trying to communicate with us.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. Through death.
MIK:
8.
CARTE:
6.
JULIA:
3!
CARTE:
(laughs)
MARIS:
9.
Laughter.
SEA:
Okay, so… basically Magnus and Blat take—basically, a shell explodes near you, and you are both going to take damage. You’re both going to take 4 hit points of damage.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhh!
SEA:
And Darcy and Eggerton, you guys have a choice. You can continue holding on to the party—there’s like, shells exploding all around you as this plane banks and passes by you. So you can hold on and take damage or you can let go.
MARIS:
I will let go.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
I’m going to hold onto Darcy but let go of everyone else.
SEA:
Okay. So you two are both tumbling off away, because the explosion sends you flying, and you both take 2 hit points damage.
MARIS:
What!
SEA:
And I don’t think either of you have armour. And this contraption, plane, banks and zooms off as all these shells impact all across this giant galactopoid from the void. And it groans and turns a little, starting to put you underneath it, as you are continuing in freefall.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Galacty!
SEAN (AS THE GALACTOPOID)
RRRRRR.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You can eat this!
SEAN (AS THE GALACTOPOID)
YARRRR.
SEA:
Suddenly the two of you—so Magnus and Blat—you are clinging to this eyelash as the eyelash starts to close down. And you feel yourselves start to lift and move and bank with this giant creature. Darcy and Eggerton, you are continuing to fall away, tumbling head over heels.
MARIS:
Aaaaaa…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaa!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Wha-ha-ha-haaa! This is awesome!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouting hoarsely)
All right! Magnum! Hold on to Galacty! I have to let go of you and fly down to get Eggerton and Darcy.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll fly back up and get the two of you after he’s eaten… whatever this very dangerous metal bird is.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right! Good luck!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So long!
CARTE:
And Blat lets go, and rushes down with his wings tucked behind him to get maximum velocity to grab onto Darcy and Eggerton!
SEA:
Give me a Defy Danger roll, Blat, as you let go and backwards-fall down into a Batman pose.
MIK:
With “Danger Zone” playing.
CARTE:
6.
SEA:
Do you have a Dex bonus? I think you do.
CARTE:
7.
SEA:
Okay. So you, as you drop back and you start to angle down on them, you realize that you’re being pulled off by something you are wearing or holding. Something in your pack is giving you too much pull. It’s lifting you off target. You’re having trouble flying, with your arms folded. What do you want to drop or let go of?
CARTE:
My pants.
Laughter.
SEA:
Kay.
So Blat, you manage to rip your pants off and—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I do this for love!
MIK:
(giggles)
SEA:
Magnus, you are clinging to this eyelash as you feel this giant void galactopoid pivot and suddenly accelerate. I need you to roll Defy Danger.
JULIA:
Uh, 4.
Laughter.
SEA:
And Magnus? What sound do you make as you are ripped off the side of this eye, as the Galactopoid takes off after this—
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(screams)
Daaaah!
SEA:
Okay! So Blat, you are zooming down at full velocity towards this tumbling mess that is Darcy and Eggerton. And you are able to grab on to, from your roll you’re able to grab on to… who do you want to grab?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll grab on to Darcy first.
SEA:
Okay. So you are going to grab Darcy. Darcy you are suddenly snatched, and thrown sideways and grabbed.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Dah!
SEA:
By a naked Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Don’t look at that. Don’t look at that. Just keep looking up. Just keep looking up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I thought things were awkward before.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s all right. We can talk about that later. Wait, just scan for Eggsy. Where’s Eggsy?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
SEA:
…says Eggsy, who’s hanging on to her legs.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Excellent. I thought I was going to have to do that twice. Because I really don’t think I have the energy to do it twice.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Don’t look up, Eggerton. Just keep looking down.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s too late! It’s right in my face!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Look—oh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh—again, I’m sorry, I had to—ahem—get rid of something that was causing me, uh, wind drift.
SEA:
Now you are still plummeting full down. Wings are not spread. And you’re holding on to Darcy. So you see the ground. You’re exiting the clouds and you see ground, still a ways away, but rushing at you.
CARTE:
So I’ll slowly open my wings up to slow our descent.
SEA:
Okay.
CARTE:
And as I do so I scan the sky to make sure that the Galactopoid is attacking the giant metal bird.
SEA:
So you basically slowly open your wings, and it’s pretty rough. So you’re all like being shaken around—
Darcy and Eggerton groan and cry out.
SEA:
—as you start to open, and looking up, you see a massive shadow of a being, moving away at pretty decent clip. And that’s when Magnus passes you guys.
Magnus zooms past, shouting incoherently.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, dammit.
Hang on, everyone!
CARTE:
So I press Eggerton and Darcy against my naked form, tuck my wings back again, and shoot down like a rocket towards Magnum.
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger.
CARTE:
8.
SEA:
Dex bonus?
CARTE:
Yes.
SEA:
Okay. So you are rocketing after Magnus. Your wings are tucked. You’re getting a lot of—you’re being pulled. You’re being rocketed left, right, because you’ve got a lot of stuff going on. And you see him coming… but you’re coming in too fast.
CARTE:
I open my wings up, scream:.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Anyone who can grab him, grab him! Anyone who can grab him, grab him! Anyone who can grab him, grab him! Anyone who can grab him, grab him! Anyone who can grab him, grab him! Anyone who can grab him, grab him! Anyone who can grab him, grab him! Anyone who can grab him, grab him!
MIK:
I let go…
Laughter.
MIK:
And grab on to Magnus.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yngh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I got you, Magnus!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Noooo!
SEA:
And now the two of them are tumbling away from you, because you pulled out your wings.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Wlaaaa!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wings! Eggsy, you’ve got wings! Use the wings, Eggsy!
MIK:
So I spread my wings… and continue tumbling through the air.
SEA:
Yep. You see his wings flapping as he continues to tumble through the air down towards the ground.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eggsy! Your clothes! Your clothes are slowing you down! Take off the clothes, Eggsy! It’s the only way!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?! Don’t take off your clothes!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, Magnus! You get my pants, I’ll get the shirts!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Oh God! Okay…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, oh! No, careful! Careful! Oh, those are snaps!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Augh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh geez.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aaa!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh no.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Oh my goodness.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He can’t fly! You have to go and rescue them! He’s a flightless fairy!
SEA:
Eggerton, you remember the bowl, in your head…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
You can be anything you think of, dude…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(softly)
A pigeon!
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They’re excellent flyers! That’s what I’ll do! Okay, I think I just—
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
A pigeon?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I need to think about this really hard…
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Seriously?
MIK:
(whispering as he rolls)
Shapeshifter, shapeshifter, shapeshifter…
MARIS:
Wow.
MIK:
11!
SEA:
We cut to the ground. And Blat, you land with your wings out. Darcy, you are deposited very gently on the ground.
A thump of wings catching the air.
SEA:
And ahead of you in the pond, you hear the thrashing of Eggerton and Magnus.
Frantic flapping. A whistling and splash as they plummet into water.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I got it! I got it! We’re good! I flew, I flew! Did you see me fly? I was a bird. I was like a bird! I flew!
(sighs)
Yeah… it was awesome. I’m a bird.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(shellshocked)
I can’t believe I’m still alive!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, it’s because I’m so good at my shapeshifting and I turned into a bird and I flew you into the pond and saved our lives. You’re welcome.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(groans)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggsy. Put your pants back on.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eggsy, throw me your coat. I need something to wrap around myself.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, here you go.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve never been more humiliated in my life.
But you have to admit that was pretty dang cool. Huh? Huh?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I was a pigeon.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You were a pigeon! You were a pigeon! And, and you landed in a pond! And… did you see the size of that creature that we brought through multiple dimensions?! We met Death! Death!
SEA:
You hear air sirens sounding, resounding across the countryside. And above, you see all these flying metal contraptions zooming off towards the big—you can still see—the giant galactopoid, way up above the clouds. And all these contraptions are flying and shooting, and explosions are ricocheting off. And you see it turning and just this giant orifice opening, and just swallowing like, five, six of them, as it continues to circle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They’re excited we’re here. They’re doing fireworks.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we’ve brought a huge amount of chaos to this plane, wherever we are.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that’s our job done. Let’s move on to the next one.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. Best not to think about it because we’ve probably doomed this particular plane to a godawful end. Okay! Who wants to try to Limbo travel?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(sobs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(defeated)
I just want to go back to Celene’s castle and be executed.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I was just trying to deliver some mail!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. You’ve traumatized this poor kid. The things he’s seen! He was just trying to deliver mail. Look what we’ve done to him. He almost thought he was have to make a deal with Death. What have we done?!
(sobs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What we had to, Darcy. What we had to to live.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That galactopoid might have had some kids and he might have wanted to just go home and go to sleep, but we brought him to another dimension and now he’s getting lightning things thrown at him.
SEAN (AS THE GALACTOPOID)
EATING.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
While we may have doomed this dimension, we saved a Galactopoid who would have starved to death!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Looking on the bright side. I like it. Look up in the sky at how happy he is!
SEA:
And you see him eat like, seven more things. And you hear tanks moving on the road, and the air sirens getting louder…
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
So, uh, what do you figure if you void-jump without your pants?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’ll probably be a bit breezy.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
But maybe it’ll work this time.
SEA:
All right. So what we’re going to do now, just because this is too crazy… So we’re going to basically appear back in Celene’s court.
Laughter.
SEA:
We’re going to start in Celene’s court and each one of you is going to describe what your character now looks like.
So I think you’ve probably been void-jumping for, let’s say, days.
CARTE:
Sure.
SEA:
OK? So I want you to have some fun with what’s happened to you, what state you’re in, what you might have with you or whatever. And so we’re gonna start.
THE END OF THE ROA:
Whoosh. The chattering voices of the fae echo through the hall.
SEA:
There’s a resounding clap of thunder and you are back in an endlessly long hall. And it’s a very dark hall so, it takes a second for your eyes to all adjust, and you hear a whisper surge through and down the hall as you realize you are back in Celene’s palace. And thousands, tens of thousands of fae line the sides of this hall that are suddenly hushed as you all four come into existence. And what do we see?
CARTE:
Blat is still naked, with Eggerton’s jacket wrapped around his embarrassing parts. He’s wearing a pith helmet, carrying a spear and there are splotches of blue paint all over him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right! I didn’t think I would say this but… we’re ready to be executed now.
SEA:
And beside him?
MARIS:
Darcy’s dragging along behind, and her centaur pants are completely splattered with mud and grass. But she’s also dragging this fairly large sack of like, gumdrops and things like that behind her. And she’s lost a shoe, and her hair is messier than usual, and she’s really glaring at Blat.
MIK:
Eggerton is wearing a formal tuxedo top with one pant leg and a loincloth, holding a rubber chicken and using it as nunchuk, and eating a gumdrop with his mouth full saying,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(slurring incoherently)
I’m ready, I’m ready to do it… Chicken!
JULIA:
Magnus has some kind of a bird for a hat.
Laughter.
JULIA:
His robes are completely sodden in something that is blue, and on his feet are a pair of work boots, and he’s carrying a couple of books from a library somewhere.
SEA:
And a murmur starts up in the hall and washes forward down the hall as a light comes on at the end of this hall in the distance. And you see what looks like a throne that is built out of skeletons and half-decomposed bodies, and also grass and flowers all mixed together.
And on that throne in the distance, you see a familiar figure.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(resigned)
Hello, Celene.
SEA:
And you see a hand raise and a finger snap in the air—and you are suddenly all transported and standing ten feet in front of the throne.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I remember a time when that would have upset me.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(sweetly)
I thought you had left me.
SEA:
…she says, as she begins to get down and step towards you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We did leave you. And oh, the things that we saw!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(furtively)
Limbo jump! Limbo jump!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I can’t. I… we’ve been limbo jumping for so long.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
She’s so scary!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’ve seen Death! This scares you? Yes, this would have been scary once upon a time, but… time? I don’t even know how long we’ve been jumping! I could be a thousand years older for all I know! Celene…
SEA:
And she’s suddenly right in front of you and she’s caressing your chin and cheek.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh Celene, we’re so tired. I admit, we were trying to limbo jump to get back to the tree to get away from you. But I just couldn’t do it. We’ve seen the sights of a few dozen universes. I’m not going to tell you where I got this hat from. But now we realize—well, I realized—it’s time to pay the piper. I’ve come to accept whatever punishment you feel you need to mete out because I didn’t bestow the tree to you.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(laughs lightly)
Punishment? Oh, that’s kinky, Blat. I had no idea! Oh, so cute.
SEA:
And she lets her finger trace across your chest as she passes by Magnus.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
What a lovely hat… Magnus?
Silence.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(thunders)
I SAID IT’S A LOVELY HAT.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(panicking)
Oh thank you it’s just a bird that took a liking to me and then I couldn’t really get it to get off my head!
MARISA (AS THE BIRD)
(coos)
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh! Nice. That’ll fit well with my plans for you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Plans?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, Eggerton! You’ve dressed up for me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, actually this came from an elf named Bubba. And—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes, that’s enough, yes, thank you.
Laughter.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Ohh. And you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Would you like a gumdrop?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
They’re the size of suitcases.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I might like a gumdrop. Is that a euphemism, Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, it’s just a gum drop.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Ahh. Right. Very well.
Well. This has been lovely, you all. Thank you so much for coming.
SEA:
And she turns and heads up to sit on her throne, and starts talking to a fae that comes flying in and lands beside her on her armrest.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(softly)
Hm? Yes. Yes. No. I’d say no. Hmm, yes. Kill them all. Those other ones, yes. And what about the section? Yes, yes, no, that’s fine…
SEA:
And she’s just having a conversation.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did anyone else hear the kill word?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, yes. I’ve been preparing for the kill word for the last four limbo jumps.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I thought we were gonna be the kill word. What is happening here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’ve got my rubber chickens so I’m ready to do whatever needs to be doing.
SEA:
And she stops and turns. She’s like,
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Why are you all still here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re… we’re waiting for you to kill us.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(laughs)
Oh, you won’t get off that easy. Oh, I’m sorry, I forgot! You know, I’m so busy. I’m making you all full citizens of my land.
Cheering.
SEA:
And roar goes up in the crowd as all the fae begin to cheer. And chant and cheer and jump around. They all come running in around you from the sides. There are—everything, like there’s walls that come apart and all the bricks are running over. There are birdlike beings. There are robes made of shadows that appear to have no one in them but you see two eyes open up. And they’re all running around you and touching you and celebrating and laughing and yaaaay!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I just got this typewritten note that says “CONGRATULATIONS.”
(to Celene)
This is very bizarre. We weren’t expecting this, but it’s very charitable of you.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Isn’t it.
Be off with them.
SEA:
And she waves a hand and goes back to talking to the fae beside her.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we might be dismissed. I think we can maybe just leave?
SEA:
And a bunch of fae tugging at you and leading you towards a side door.
SEAN (AS THE FAE)
Come, come! Yay! Congratulations!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yay! Hooray for us. Let’s go out the side door.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This side door doesn’t have a sacrificial pyre out there, does it?
SEAN (AS THE FAE)
No!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s just a pathway, right?
SEAN (AS THE FAE)
No! We’re taking you to the Processing Room. Congratulations!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re being processed… yay!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But not into goo, right? Just into citizens.
SEAN (AS THE FAE)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay then!
Yay Processing Room.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, excuse me. You. Fae closest to me.
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
(gruff voice)
Yeah, yeah. Sure. What can I get for you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry, um…
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
Oh, congratulations!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, thank you very much, no, I enjoy being a moon citizen. Um, my question is: why isn’t your goddess terribly upset with us?
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
Oh we don’t—we don’t—we wouldn’t presume to—I wouldn’t presume to think what my goddess thinks…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s just that… she asked us to name a place in her honour, and we didn’t do that, and we just assumed that she was gonna murderize us because of that and that’s why we’ve been avoiding her for all this time.
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
That’s valid.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Follow-up question: what is involved in processing?
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
Oh, well, I think you’re going to be briefed. You go through the briefing. They explain everything about citizenship.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We went through a briefing once and it was not overly beneficial. So maybe you could give us just like a little bit of a hint about what we can expect?
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
Well, you just go in, you go into the Processing—you’re you’re going to be briefed, I think. It’s part of—there’s a whole citizenship process. I’m not part of that committee. Congratulations, though!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh yes, thank you very much.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thanks.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe she thinks that everything we’ve suffered through Blat’s limbo jumps has paid us back for what we did to her. Maybe she actually has a reasonable side. And this is all going to end well—
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
I doubt that.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Or maybe she’s making us citizens so she can keep us here forever!
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
Yeah, that’s probably definitely it.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?!
SEAN (AS A BRICK)
Have a nice day! Congratulations!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, thank you, thank you very much.
SEA:
And the brick walks away.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So now we need to escape from Celene?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Again?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All I really want is my official Moon Person birth certificate. Get a room somewhere with a bed, and sleep for a few millennia.
Moon me up! I want to be a Moonite! I’ll go first with the briefing!
THE BRIEFIN:
SEA:
So you are all led into a very normal-looking room. The door says BRIEFING ROOM—PROCESSING AND WELCOME CENTRE. There’s a bunch of chairs, there’s a little podium at the front, and there’s some kind of screen-like device, and you are all let in by a talking book who points with their pages, to sit down. And as you’re all sort of standing there, a large tree tries to force its way through the door towards—
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
(straining)
Ungh! Sorry, sorry…
SEA:
It pops in.
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Welcome, welcome. I’m here to give your briefing. Please have a seat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Could we perhaps, um, speak to the manager?
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
I am the manager, yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh good. Good.
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Please, have a seat and you may speak.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay I’ll sit here—
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Oh, congratulations. It’s very rare for us to have new citizens.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you, thank you very much.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s very nice.
So we were wondering if maybe you could help us go back to the Nexus, which is where I think we’re from? I don’t really remember any more where we’re from.
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Yes. So this all maybe a little new to you all. How this works is, I’m going to give the name of the slide and then explain it and—I know this will be very unusual—and then what’s going to happen is, you all are going to give me names of the next slide and then I’ll give that briefing. That’s how it works around here. I know it’s strange.
Okay! So the first slide is: “Welcome to Processing.” So here, as you see on the screen, we’ve had some problems in the past with you humans because of this whole panic thing, heh heh heh—right. So the idea of this whole seminar is to help introduce the concepts to you so you don’t panic because that really doesn’t help with the whole process.
So that’s the end of that slide. Next slide!
MARIS:
“The Lunar Cycle: From Birth to Death in Celene’s Kingdom.”
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Ah, yes. So here you see this depiction of the lunar cycle in its—we break it down into its 92 parts. Each one has a different name. You’ll be quizzed on that later. And basically, this would be your journey. So think of it as life, but you’re reborn every lunar cycle. So it’s endless! You will live forever!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Oh God.
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Yes. Let’s go to the next slide.
CARTE:
“No! Everything Isn’t Made of Cheese.”
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Right. So there’s a common misperception amongst you people because nobody’s ever been to the moon, right? Right? Heh heh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh no, we certainly have not! No, we have never been to the moon. No.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
No!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No. First time for everything.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It is a place of wonder and mystery.
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
You’ll find when you get there, there’s no oxygen, no way to breathe, and it’s not made of cheese, it’s made of rock! Rock, people, rock! Yes. But anyways, as fae, you’ll be able to go there all the time, that you wish. We go there quite—it’s sort of like a resort. You know, you get tired of the grind, you know. Yes. But there’s no ocean.
Okay. Yes. Next slide?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
“By the Way, You’re All Fae Now.”
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Right! Heh heh. This is my attempt at a joke. So you’ll be second-class citizens, of course. So just to break this in slowly… So you will be Shadowborn. Right. Fae, we can’t really procreate per se. You know, Celene does like her little toys, but for the most part you either get born here—so you get stuck here and you’re pregnant—maybe you were led astray by a fae, ha ha—so that would be one way you’d be Shadowborn. But we have a method of creating Shadowborn out of humans. Um, really, it’s not that painful. And it’s pretty straightforward. And of course you have a choice in the matter! You can also choose to just, you know, die in the void. But that’s a—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me. There’s only two humans here. What’s going to happen to the demon and the fairy?
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Well, the demon will be processing as if he’s human, because he’s half human. The fairy… that’s a difficult topic. There is a process by which fae become Shadowborn, it’s… you become a second-class citizen again. But yes.
Next slide!
JULIA:
“Your Part in Celene’s Big Plan to Someday Rule the Multiverse.”
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Right! So it’s important that once you see this slide there’s no going back. Ha! Too late! Ha ha ha! It’s a joke. There’s really no going back for any of us. Okay! So basically, Celene’s plan—you’ll see here, this part’s crossed out because it sort of hinged on, well, a certain site of ancient power being dedicated in her name. So that person sort of derailed everything… but aside from that, you’ll see all the other steps here. We’re just revising them, so the plan’s under revision now for how we’re going to make all this happen.
Next slide!
MARIS:
“A Difficult Topic.”
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Right. So, you know, this is sort of the end, so rather than tell you, I thought we just—you know, we’ll just go into the next room and, you know, we can demonstrate for you the process that you’ll be using to become Shadowborn.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t like the sound of Shadowborn. Blat, didn’t you mentioned something about meeting a Shadowborn at some point?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, his name was Jerry, and he didn’t have any discernible features, so if you were…
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
So you’d fit right in!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is no time for jokes!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I’m just try to lighten the mood here! We’re all going to be Shadowborn!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we’re not going to have a face!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Augh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I like my face and I’d like to keep it please.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. Could we keep our faces?
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Oh yes. Yes, you may keep your faces. They may be slightly rearranged or in a different place, but you’ll get to keep them. We can mark that down, yes, that’s possible.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(groans)
Oh boy…
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
So if you’ll just step out…
SEA:
And he opens a smaller door that’s sort of older, and you hear the sound of machinery in the other room, and the scent of antiseptic. And he steps through it and pushes his way through as the branches—
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
(straining)
Oh, sorry, it gets stuck—
SEA:
—and pops into the next room.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Oh God.
MIK:
I close the door behind him.
SEA:
Eggerton, you catch sight of basically a spherical, perfectly clean room. And there is a tube with like a sheet across the front of it, but you hear the whirring of blades and you hear some screaming, and then there’s an empty opening into the void as you close the door.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, team, I don’t really want to get upgraded like this. So let’s figure out a way to get back to the tree.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, I’m going to cast Guidance to commune with Loxsyn.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You could have done that this whole time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, if anyone had ever let me get a word in edgewise, I would have!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, maybe if you and Blat figured out this will-they, won’t-they thing, we all would have had time to figure something out, like how to eat! How to get home! I don’t know, how to avoid being here. But no. We all got—
(stops himself)
You know, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is a surprising part of you, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s been a long couple of weeks.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It has.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And I feel that I need to just sit in a kitchen and I need to bake.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And be alone with myself for a bit.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why don’t you have another sugar plum.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs)
The sugar plums…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
They’re not as good as fairy cakes, I know.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There’s no love in them.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But there’s a lot of sugar.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There is sugar. Okay. I’ll take a—I’ll eat the sugar plum.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Now just, everyone, I need quiet to be able to commune with Loxsyn. I’m hoping she can get us out of here.
SEA:
You hear the whirring of blades and screaming, and there’s a knocking at the door.
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Hello? You have to come out at some point!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, we’ll be right there! We’re just—we’re giving thanks to Celene for all of the whirringness that she provides.
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Remember, it’s your new selves that are going to be born!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Just practicing our screams. We want them to be—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaaa!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Aaaaaaa!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Or should I go, “Oohhhhh”?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Oh, that’s good, that’s good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s a good one? “Ohhhhh…”
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Very good. Just let me know when you’re done.
MARIS:
So can I commune with Loxsyn?
SEA:
Okay!
MARIS:
Do you want me to read this to you?
SEA:
Yeah, how does it go?
MARIS:
“The symbol of your deity appears before you and gestures towards the direction or course of action your deity would have you take, then disappears. The message is through gesture only.”
SEA:
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Everyone just be quiet and make sure no one comes through that door.
MARIS:
So I sit down on the ground cross-legged and I put my hand around my amulet, and I close my eyes. And I think very clearly about Loxsyn. And I ask in my head,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Loxsyn, please help us. We don’t know what to do. We don’t know how to get out of here. Please show me a sign. Anything that will help us.
Chimes and soft strings. Loxsyn’s theme plays on a flute.
SEA:
So all of a sudden, a warm light fills the room.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(softly)
Oooo.
SEA:
And a form begins to appear in the air on the far side of the room, and it is a form you have seen before, Darcy. It is Loxsyn with the flowing hair and the robes, somewhat see-through in this very warm, almost blinding light as she takes form in the room. She moves forward and touches your arm, Darcy, and you feel a sudden surge through your body, of just energy and warmth and comfort.
And then the head turns and the contact breaks, and she starts moving towards the rest of you. And she stops in front of Blat, and reaches up and places a hand on his cheek, and a hand on his other cheek, and pulls him forward and kisses him on the forehead.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(witless chuckling)
SEA:
And she’s gone.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no.
Laughter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we have to limbo jump.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
No! No we are not—ughhh! No!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But it’s either that or I kiss him on the forehead and I don’t think that’s going to make any difference!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sings weakly)
Thirty-three bottles of mead on the wall, thirty-three bottles of mead…
I just want to go home…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think that’s the only thing it could mean! Unless Blat can fly us all out of here, which I don’t think he can, we’ve got to limbo jump!
A knocking at the door.
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
How’s it going in there? Are you almost ready?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(fake screaming)
Aaaa! I don’t think I have the right pitch yet!
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Okay, well, we’re almost empty on the chamber! Ready for the next one!
CARTE:
Blat kicks the doorknob off of the door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, there’s something wrong with the door!
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
What?
SEA:
The door jiggles.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, no, very broken, we’ll have to fix it on our end!
SEAN (AS THE TREE)
Oh okay, well, hurry up!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right! I’ll try to find some tools.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat. If you think hard enough, can you control where we leap?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I thought I could, but let me see… how have your last two weeks been?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Terrible! But I don’t want my face down where my foot is!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, and neither do I. Which is why I’m going to do this.
You three, stay in this room.
MARIS:
(gasps)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m going to go talk to Celene.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh… I didn’t see that coming.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And for once, it’s going to be something that I do on my own.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right.
SEA:
We cut to Blat coming back into the room. And how do you look, Blat?
CARTE:
Blat has pants on. A nice crisp white shirt and a tie.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. It’s been decided. Celene is going to beam you back to the tree.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
That’s great!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Good news!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Great.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There’s only one problem.
With my limbo abilities, I told Celene that she’d be able to go to any point in the multiverse, and set up any little worshiping tree that she might want. The only way she can do that is through me.
So you three go off, tell everyone I’m sorry… but I’m going to be sticking around here for a while.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No!

Last time on The End of Time and Other Bothers:
Fast‐paced music plays.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello, Celene.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(sweetly)
I thought you had left me.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We did leave you. And oh, the things that we saw!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… Hello! Hello, Giant Eyeball. Nice to meet you. Uh… my name is Dar—
SEAN (AS THE GIANT EYEBALL)
FOOOOOOD.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, that’s not good.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I know where you can get lots of food! Celene’s castle!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Mr. Grim Reaper!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
You’re calling for Death?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re kind of old friends.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
WHAT?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I owe him a favour.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
You said I had to save her! I—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And do you know why you had to save her? Because I love Darcy!
SEA:
And you see what looks to be some kind of moving vehicle with wings… and it begins to fire.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eggsy, you’ve got wings!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I was a bird. I flew!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(shellshocked)
I can’t believe I’m still alive!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re… we’re waiting for you to kill us.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, you won’t get off that easy. I’m making you all full citizens!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What is involved in processing?
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
We’re all going to be Shadowborn!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we’re not going to have a face!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Augh!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s been decided. Celene is going to beam you back to the tree.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
That’s great!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Good news!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Great.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But I’m going to be sticking around here for a while.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No!
THE PARTING OF THE WAY:
SEA:
We open on a winter scene: a glade amidst the snow-covered trees; freshly fallen snow over a large fae stone in the centre—when suddenly, a light blossoms out, sending all the trees bending backwards as everything whirls around, fairies flying through the air—and then with a pop it’s gone, leaving a small fairy in the air, another fairy on the ground named Eggerton. Darcy and Magnus.
They are back in Paradox.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is Blat gone?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Oh yes! He’s gone! Uh, so he sent his best wishes.
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But—Blat—we’re—no—Blat… it’s a trick! Right?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, it’s gotta be a trick, I mean, he’s going to appear here any minute, right? That’s what Blat does. He fakes people out, and then he makes us all really mad at him and then he just comes back and it’s all like it used to be and then he just keeps making us mad at him, right? I mean, that’s what’s going on here.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
I’ll check! Wait!
SEA:
Poof!
The fairy disappears with a plink!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You don’t really get used to that disappearing poofy thing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, not at all.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(whimpers)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s OK, Magnus. We’re all a little in shock right now, but I’m sure it’ll all work out. We’re—Blat’s going to be back in no time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe you should just sit down for a minute.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Get your bearings again.
SEA:
Foof!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
No, Blat’s not coming!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He’s… really not coming?
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
I’ll check!
SEA:
Poof!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I feel like we need to phrase our questions a little more delicately next time, because the fairies, from what I have heard, sometimes don’t listen too well and then just start talking or going and running off and it gets very frustrating for people trying to communicate with them. I can’t imagine what that’s really like.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I imagine you can’t.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(a strangled noise of distress)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, it’s okay, Magnus. Let it out. Let it out.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(screams)
SEA:
Poof!
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Celene said no more questions!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine. We don’t have any more. We’re home and I guess that’s what matters.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, we’re home. But you know, without Blat it doesn’t really feel like home. And I guess this isn’t really home for Magnus either, because, you know, it’s kind of out of time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s true. We should probably get him back to where he’s come from.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
(whimpers)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, your expression says it all, Magnus. I don’t know how we could have done this without you. Thank you, friend.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Yeah yeah yeah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
All right.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. Thanks Magnus. You were pretty impressive in the end, actually.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I hope you’ll remember us.
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
No one’s going to tip me, right?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, we need you to take Magnus so—
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
Okay, so—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yup. Yeah, he says he’s going to tip you.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s very generous of him.
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
What are you talking about—
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Okay!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I just want to—
SEAN (AS THE FAIRY)
Say goodbye, Magnus!
JULIAN (AS MAGNUS)
I want to get out of—
SEA:
Poof!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Bye, Magnus!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He was a cute little guy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Well, I hope he has a relatively dull and uneventful life after this.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s the best kind.
I guess we have to go tell Moira.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah it’s going to be hard for you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. Hard for both of us.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. I hope you can find the words.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(stern)
Eggerton, you’re coming with me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’ll come, I’m going to come, of course I’m going to come. I wouldn’t let you go do it yourself. I just, you know, you’re the wordsmith of the group.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Actually… that might have been Blat.
They both sigh.

Episode 15: Solstice.
RETURN TO THE ACADEM:
An acoustic rendition of the theme music on guitar and recorder.
SEA:
We find Eggerton and Darcy walking slowly through the streets of Paradox, the roar of the waterfall and the light mist coating everything. But the sound seems dampened and a little removed as the two approach the gates of the Academy of the Fallen.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This place just doesn’t seem the same anymore.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I didn’t hear you over the sound of the waterfall! It’s very loud!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I said, this…! Oh never mind, let’s just go in.
SEA:
As the two of you approach the pathway which you’ve travelled a ton of times, and you’re coming up towards the main entrance of the Academy of the Fallen, suddenly something seems different.
And it takes a moment to process that there are two—giant almost, very large—what appear to be knights in full plate armour, slightly rusted, standing unmoving outside the front door, on each side of the doors.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t remember those. Do you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, no… I think there used to be trees there, actually. That’s weird.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, there was that one that Blat took out with his bazooka.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aww.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But you’re right. There definitely weren’t knights, I don’t think. We’re going to have to ask Moira what’s going on here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Let’s just squeeze past these—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
SEA:
And immediately as you approach they turn in unison and drop weapons down in front menacingly.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Definitely different. Definitely different.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
H‑hello? We are heroes, here to see our handler, Moira? Uh… We don’t have a password but—
SEAN (AS A KNIGHT)
(voice muffled by a helmet)
You are not authorized.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uhh… Actually, I think you’ll find that we are. If you know, if you just look up the list, under E for Eggerton, Party.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And D for Darcy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, no, Darcy’s probably just like a sub-list under mine. But if you look at the top of the list you’ll see Eggerton.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think D comes before E. Probably Darcy, Party.
SEA:
They both freeze, lifting weapons. One is lifting a giant war axe and the other is lifting a giant sword. And then they freeze—and then slowly return to standing as they were.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you! That was—
SEAN (AS A KNIGHT)
Darcy was on the list.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Well.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Boom.
All right! Well, let’s just proceed then. Come through with me, guest.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They probably had the lists upside down, so you know, the VIP at the bottom.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sure that that’s it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s what it was. Okay, let’s go, let’s go in! Let’s find Moira.
SEA:
As you step in to what used to be an empty, long hall with the doors leading to the Quartermaster and Moira’s office, you stop again because there are four more giant knights in full plate mail standing sort of halfway down the corridor, and then at the far end where the stairs are.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This must be a new security system or something. They’re everywhere.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t remember seeing anything about security systems that involved plate metal. There was the fun one that had the trebuchet. I’m pretty sure we had that at the office.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. But there are no trebuchets here. This is what we’re facing. I don’t remember any of this! What’s going on here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know! You’re the one who’s on the list.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Fine. I’m on the list. We’re going to find Moira. Let’s just go to her office. We’re going to figure this out.
MARIS:
And Eggerton and I march over to Moira’s office and knock on the door.
SEA:
Okay. There’s a pause and then you hear a—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(muffled by the door)
Who is it?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s Darcy and Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Eggerton and Darcy, reporting in.
Silence.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Are you alone?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I have Darcy with me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And I have Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, technically I have Darcy with me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let’s just go in.
MARIS:
And I open the door.
SEA:
It’s locked.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why is the door locked? Moira! Moira, it’s Darcy and Eggerton. Can we come in?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Again, that’s Eggerton and Darcy reporting.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, of course, of course.
SEA:
And you hear a bolt turn and the door open.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Please, I’m so sorry. Come in. I was just finishing some paperwork.
MARIS:
And I enter ahead of Eggerton and I look around furtively to see if anything is weird in this office.
SEA:
The office looks similar to the last time you were in there trying to file forms against, I think, Blat. And there’s a lot of papers and things that have sort of been shoved under some envelopes on her desk. And she closes the door behind you, doesn’t lock it, and comes around to her desk and sits down and says,
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
So… you two are alone?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes! We’re alone. In fact, we have something really terrible to tell you. Blat didn’t come back with us.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Oh. Oh, I see. And Ananka…?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. But see, Blat didn’t come back with us. The demon? With the bazooka? We lost him. He’s not here.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, yes, yes. And I’ll get the full report. But um, my sister Ananka—did she come back with you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I haven’t seen Ananka forever! I don’t even remember the last time we saw her.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She was in the nice house.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, the weird chicken house, right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It wasn’t weird! It was nice.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It was odd.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
If you petted it, it would kind of croon a little bit.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
A house on legs, Eggerton? That walk? That’s disturbing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I don’t know that it’s disturbing. I think it’s probably a little unique.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Okay. Thank you. So. Yes. And Greg. Have you seen the minotaur?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. He was there too. He came in with Ananka.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
He was where?
SEA:
She looks really tense.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um, uh, they were in the house together and they were going to talk and—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Which house, Eggerton? Slow down.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It was the one with the legs.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The chicken house.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And they ran away, right? The house ran away with them in it, I think.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. And then Blat, though. I don’t know if you heard but Blat, he’s in the service of Celene now. I think Darcy has more to tell you about that.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes. Great. We’ll get to that. So… did you have any conversations with…? So what brings you back to—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Listen, Moira. I don’t want to offend you, but our friend Blat, who we’ve been through blood sweat and tears with, might be dead for all we know. He’s under the sway of this moon goddess. We need you to do something! He’s not here with us. Remember, we’re supposed to save the universe and time and everything? You used to care about that.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I do. I do. I’m sorry, Darcy. Please, can I get you all some tea?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I would love a pepperm—uh, no, Blat, though!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. I don’t think we need any refreshments, do we, Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No. But, you know, if you’re making tea, maybe peppermint tea would be nice.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes. I’ll get you a peppermint tea. And yourself, Darcy? Nothing?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Nothing for me.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Very well. So why don’t you—well, there’s only one chair.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ll sit in the chair.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine, Eggerton. You’ll need somewhere to sit when you sip your peppermint tea.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, it can be kind of hot and I like to balance it on the saucer. Because if you put it down, sometimes you get these little rings. And I think the rings are pretty on the wood. But some people don’t really—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(clears her throat)
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Great. So I think what might be best is if you write up a full report that we can understand what happened to Blat. And we can mobilize and figure out what our next step is. I would also like to just make sure you cover everything, and the last time you saw Ananka and Greg. For they—I don’t know how to say this but… they may have moved against the Nexus.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What? What now?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Which is why there’s—you may have noticed the new Knights as you entered.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. That was weird.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
By the way, I think they have their lists upside down. I’m pretty sure that—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? No, it’s because the VIP—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is not—no. Forget the list.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Fine. So… Blat, though. We should we should probably try and get Blat back because Blat has the bazooka. And you know, while I take on the leadership role, Blat’s really the one who can help us get out of some sticky spots. I mean, Darcy’s around, but—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Your tea’s getting cold. You should drink some of that.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. Take a sip.
Moira! What are you talking about? Greg and Ananka are acting against us? Ananka was helping us!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes. Well, Ananka is my sister. I am… I’m quite torn up by this. And I’m still trying to process. So any information you have would really help me understand what’s going on. So I would like you both to write a full report, and please—yes, I’m sorry that you may have lost Blat. And hopefully he is fine. But there are risks in this job, as we all know. I may have lost a sister. So why don’t we just get a full report and—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Here’s the problem. Blat did the reports. Blat was really good at doing the reports. He would get all the details just right, and he actually even alphabetized the different people we met by the names we learned.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It was all really pretty. Then he’d collate it all. We don’t do the reports! Eggerton and I aren’t good at the reports. We’re the action people. I can’t…
(she breaks down a little)
Excuse me, can I have some peppermint tea?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, let me make another one.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you.
(sips)
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I have to say, I did love Blat’s reports.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He always had a way of alphabetizing.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Well, they also came in triplicate, which no one’s ever done. Here’s your tea.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, so please, I’m going to give you some forms. If you can just do your best to fill out the report. It does not have to be done as well as Blat did it. We can figure out what’s going on and we can figure out what we’re going to do next. I’m afraid I have other work right now. So you both know the way to your quarters.
Oh, and tonight is Winter Festival and Snegal is going to try and put on a festive occasion in the dining hall. So, um, be sure you’re there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think I’m going to be up for any winter festival. I’m taking my peppermint—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you have any peppermint canes?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I do not. But Snegal tells me he’s preparing quite the feast.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Will there be pleather cakes and roasts?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I’m not sure, Eggerton. It’s really important that we focus on getting your report.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. Yes. So for the reports…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
And you write it when you’re not in my office.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I won’t be in your office when I write it. And there’s gonna be like, frozen peppermint tea sticks though, right? Those were always my favourite, and they’re not always easy to come across. But if there’s going to be winter stuff—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Very good. Here, just—here you go, out into the hall. Thank you, Eggerton. Darcy, if you need anything, let me know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(quietly)
I’m going to my room.
WINTER FESTIVA:
SEA:
We cut to the patter of tiny feet as we see Eggerton—well, we see half of Eggerton, as he is carrying an unbelievable assortment of pies and fairy cakes stacked up above his head. And he’s heading down the bottom stairs. It teeters—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaa…
SEA:
And somehow doesn’t fall over…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sigh of relief)
SEA:
…as Eggerton turns and heads towards the dining hall, but pauses, because there are two giant, fully encased in plate armour, knights, one on each side of the dining hall, each brandishing a giant mace.
But you hear the sound of music coming from the dining hall.
Cheerful voices and folk music in the background.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
No, put it over there! Yes, it goes over there. Thank you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I have pies! I have winter festival pies. I spent the last few hours making them. I can… Excuse—excuse me, uh, guards? I’ve got pie. Do you want a pie? Do you like cherry? What about boysenberry?
SEA:
The two guards both turn slowly in unison, on each side of you, and both heads start to angle down.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, what about… uh, I’ve got this one, this is a pleather specialty. It’s got a bit of spice in it. I made it for… well, I made it for Blat. But, um, if he’s not here, maybe you two would like to try it? I don’t think the mace—do you have a dagger? You could slice a piece out? The mace might just squish it. But need to get—
SEAN (AS A KNIGHT)
You are authorized for entry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I know I’m authorized for entry. This is home. So, you know, I’ve got these pies. It’s just you’re kind of in the way, and I want to go through and put the pies down on the table, and then I thought maybe you guys want pie! I mean you work hard, you’ve been here all day, I bet. I don’t know how long your shifts are. I once had to work a 12-hour shift, and that was really tiring. I just couldn’t imagine having to stand there like—
SEAN (AS A KNIGHT)
We do not need rest.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You don’t—well, that’s kind of sad. Do you get to like, just hang out? And you know, play ping-pong sometimes? Or do you have you have to—
SEAN (AS A KNIGHT)
You are cleared for entry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I know I’m cleared for entry! So what I’m wondering though is what you do in your downtime and if you don’t rest means you don’t sleep. Do you eat at all? Because I’ve got pies, I’ve got some cakes here in my pouch too, and then there’s probably a whole bunch of good stuff inside. A lot of peppermint-flavoured things, because peppermint’s always…
MARIS:
Twenty minutes later, Darcy stumbles down.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, hi Darcy! I was just talking about you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(drunk and slurring her words)
Eggerton, it’s so good to see you! Oh, my friend, it’s so good to see you…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Oh my. You’re being very touchy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, are those pies? Do you have boysenberry?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I do have boysenberry!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ll take five.
SEAN (AS A KNIGHT)
(desperate)
Please enter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello, guards!
SEAN (AS A KNIGHT)
Please! Enter!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hooray! It’s the Winter Festival! Woo hoo!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, guys, I’m gonna—
SEAN (AS A KNIGHT)
Please, please enter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I think the guards are getting a little tired of your frivolity here, Darcy, so let’s go inside.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, let’s go in, let’s go in. It’s the Winter Festival! Nobody cares that Blat’s gone. Why should I? This is going to be so much fun! Woo hoo! Let’s go! Snegal! Hi Snegal!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Wha? Oh, Darcyyy!
SEA:
Snegal flies through the air and side tackles Darcy, who goes stumbling back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(laughing)
It’s so good to see you, Snegal.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Darcy! Oh good, Darcy, you’re back! I heard you might be back! Oh ho ho ho! Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hi Snegal!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Wait. Where’s Blat?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Um. Here, let me put down all of my pies.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no, it’s fine, Eggerton, I’ll tell him. I mean nobody cares, why should you care? Blat’s just gone, Snegal, he’s never coming back. He’s become the Moon Goddess’s concubine or something like that, and you’re never gonna see him again. I know you really loved him but what does it matter, hearts are only there to be broken.
Oh good! Are these fairy cones?
Silence.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Blat… not coming…?
I made his favourite.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, he—he may not be coming today, but you know I think Moira, she seemed to think that maybe we can go get him. So he had to stay behind with Celene, who’s this… I don’t think you’d like her—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
We’re going to get him?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, not right now, but I think we’re gonna try. Maybe we’ll do a rescue mission?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes! Snegal do rescue mission!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
We rescue Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, we will rescue Blat! Not right now…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Not right now.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
He won’t be coming to the festival.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, but you know, I have a special job for you, Snegal.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is this pleather nog spiked? We need to spike the pleather nog. Snegal.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Snegal, where’s where’s the brandy.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I’ll get the brandy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Get the brandy. Get the whiskey. Get everything.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Snegal, I’m gonna need you to help me take care of Darcy. She seems a little upset. I mean have you noticed how much she’s talking? It’s so irritating. Maybe, you know, you can help keep an eye on her?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think she’s extra sad about Blat, and she’s not eating any of the fairy cakes I left for her.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I give her food now! I go. She likes toast.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. You go get her some toasts.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And we’ll be over—
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
But you won’t go to get Blat without me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no! We’ll take you for sure.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t imagine going to get Blat without you.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay! I made you a special demon cake!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Is that what you made for Blat, and you’re regifting for me?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
No. This one was for you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s nice of you, Snegal.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You can’t have Blat’s demon cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, we’ll save that for later. Here. And why don’t you have a very special red polka dot fairy cake? Just for you for Winter Fest!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You… got me something?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Of course! It’s Winter Fest. Even though it’s a little sad because Blat’s not here.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We still need to honour the tradition set forth by the talking trees.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You’ve—no one’s ever given Snegal a gift before.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, everybody should get a gift!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Thank you!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Snegal. Snegal. Brandy.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh yes, the brandy!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Brandy. Whisky. Now.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Snegal get brandy! I’ll be right back!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Don’t eat the demon cake too quickly.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(laughing)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How much vanilla is in these fairy cakes, Eggerton. Did you put in a lot of vanilla?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There’s, there’s lots of vanilla…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
A lot of almond extract? Is that in there?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Well, this this one is actually pleather bean extract. But—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ll take it. Just give it to me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay, here.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Darcy, can you help me get the brandy bottle out of Pfillllll-thi-tckkkkt?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh yeah, what’s Phil…?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Here, look, it’s floating in the Quartermaster, help me. Right there.
The Quartermaster’s sweeping electronic melody.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I, oh…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
It’s right there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. I’m trying. I’m trying. Hold still!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Hold still, Pfillllll-thi-tckkkkt!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, Phil the Thicket, hold still! Can you… Oh gosh. Eggerton, can you get the…? Everything’s kind of spinning right now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
It’s right there. See the bottle?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I see them. Okay, I’m going to… Excuse me! Yeah. Yeah. Over here. Could you bring the brandy over for Darcy here? She’s looking for the brandy.
SEA:
And Pfillllll-thi-tckkkkt, the giant air jelly quartermaster, floats over towards Eggerton, and lowers down in front of you. And you see the brandy bottle floating there.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is it okay if I just kind of reach in and grab…?
SEA:
As you reach it reaches towards you with its tendril..
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, that’s nice. It’s a Winter Fest miracle, ha ha ha!
And I’m gonna… I’m gonna just grab it now.
SEA:
You put your hand into the goo.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ugh.
(giggles)
It’s tickly! Uh, okay. There we go. Thank you.
SEA:
And as you grab the bottle you feel the tendrils wrap around your head… and the world disappears.
The music turns dark and menacing.
SEA:
And you are in the hall suddenly, as the world sort of appears but everything’s grey and almost double vision. Like, the lines don’t quite match up. And you see Moira running down the stairs and down the hall towards her office, and you’re slowly following her as she opens the door, and she’s shouting but you can’t make out what she’s saying.
And suddenly the front door is open, and you see these knights marching in two by two: giant, plate mail, and starting to fan out through the whole complex.
SEA:
And then suddenly you’re back in the party, and the singing…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that was unusual. I’ve never drank that much brandy just by touching it.
SEA:
And you’re holding a brandy bottle..
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well here—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, good, you got the brandy. Thanks, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy… I saw something weird from Phil-kaputuh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, Darcy. I made you this special toast. Um. And I tried to make it like Snappies. I put sugar on it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, yeah, thanks, Snegal. That’s great. Because I’m gonna make a few toasts. Ha ha ha.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Ha ha! You can use my toaster.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Here’s to Blat!
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh, to Blat! Yes, to Blat!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let’s all drink a toast to Blat, who’s never coming back ever.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And is just going to be some moon goddess lover boy for the rest of time. Okay, Blat, I hope you’re having a good time, wherever you are.
(sobs)
I’m just going to be over here now.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Darcy? Blat’s not coming?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no, Blat’ll come back. You know, it’s sad and it’s scary, but I’m sure it’ll be okay. Because it’s Winter Fest, Snegal! And that’s when wondrous things happen, at Winter Fest! Look! Look. It is so happy in here…
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
You’re just trying to make me feel better, aren’t you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, no, yeah, maybe a little, but look! Darcy’s feeling better, see? She’s, she’s throwing up in the corner! That means she’s feeling better.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(retching)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See? Everything’s gonna be okay.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I’m gonna go wrap up my present for Blat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
And put it in the freezer.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh that’s a good idea. Now, does it need to be in the freezer? Or are you just putting it in the freezer.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I’m going to probably go in the freezer too for a little bit.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh that’s that’s sad.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
I’ll see you later.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, okay. I’ll come visit you soon, okay?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And we’ll have a fairy cake together. One of the peppercorn ones that Blat would always like.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yeah, okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I should go check on Darcy and find out why Moira was yelling at the weird loopy door.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gagging and coughing)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Okay. Let it all out.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh God.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’ve got you. Here, I’ve got just the thing for you. This is a rice fairy cake. This is what we would have when we had upset tummies. And a little bit of ale ginger.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think I want anything else.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh no don’t worry about it. This will be good. Just put this in your mouth. It’s very light. See, there you go. There you go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gags)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And it’ll make you feel better. It’ll be all good. It’ll be all good. ‘Cause you know he it’s not like you’re the strong one who holds the group together. That’s my job. Because I’m the leader, so I‑I can make sure everyone’s OK. Everyone’s going to be fine. Nothing’s going to go bad.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank goodness you’re the leader, Eggerton. Thank goodness you’re going to make everything better.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I am. No pressure at all. I will fix it all.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Good. Um…
SEA:
A hush falls over the room… and Moira walks in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispering)
There’s Moira.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Moira!!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You came to the party!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy, no, I—I saw Moira, when I when I touched Pha-thil-kapth.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I’m really sorry, everyone, to do this during Winter Festival, as this is a happy time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s so happy!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, here, why don’t you sit down here, Darcy.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
But we are at war. The Shattering has moved against us, as has my sister.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps softly)
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
You should all get some rest tonight. We begin tomorrow.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait. Uh, question! Are you taking questions? I have a question. Question over here.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excuse me, Moira—question? Can I ask a question?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. When you say “we begin tomorrow,” could you define what you mean by “begin”?
Pause.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
We take this battle to the Shattering tomorrow.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um… So we’ve already kind of tried that?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Thank you, Eggerton. That will be all.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But I have a follow-up question. It’s a kind of Question 1A? I don’t know that it’s really another question. Um, it just that, you know, I don’t exactly—I mean, I had a toy boat but I don’t really have any weapons or anything.
SEA:
She steps, aside and you hear metal ringing out on stone as pair after pair of knights in full plate mail march into the room, shaking the walls, until fifty of them line the walls, all marching, pivoting and turning.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, hi. Hi guys. I’m Eggerton. This is Darcy.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
This is our army.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s only fifty.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
This is but the first battalion. We begin tomorrow, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ok. So question 1B—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
There will be no more questions.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because I’m just—
SEA:
And she turns and leaves the room.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is so great, Eggerton. Do you know why this is so great?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Because you’re the new leader!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I am!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re their general. You’re General Eggerton and this is your army and that’s why it’s all going to be different now! You’re going to fix everything. The Shattering is just gonna become the Splattering and it won’t matter anymore! Nothing matters anymore, Eggerton. Hello, soldiers!
Ugh, I don’t feel so good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh geez.
MIDROL:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey everyone. Sean here. Happy holidays! I have a few brief announcements and some special announcements about when End of Time is back. So hold onto your seats, here we go. First of all, I want to announce that we’re gonna be at PodCon in Seattle on January 18th through the 20th. Eli and I will both be there. We’re gonna be doing a meetup for Alba Salix and End of Time. So if you are coming, be sure to give us a shout out on Twitter: @AlbaSalix or @OtherBothers or on our Facebook pages.
I wanted to start by talking, because it’s sort of the end of the year, about why we started this show. We started this show because we wanted more laughter in the world and a space that was inclusive and welcoming. What we didn’t expect when we started the show was to have such a powerful and loving community around and behind this show. To each and every one of you that are interacting with us on Twitter and Facebook or in our Discord: thank you so much. It truly means the world to us to know that we are reaching other creators across mediums, and also people who just love comedy, improvisation and roleplay, and we can never thank you all enough.
Okay, so let’s get to the great news. We recently commissioned Katherine Green to create an epic new piece of art of the three adventurers: Blat, Eggerton and Darcy. And it is so awesome—I have it right now, and it’s now available on shirts in our store. You can find that by going to albasalix.com and just clicking on the Shop or Store, I forget what it’s called. But I have a special announcement. You can also get a special sticker of this same image, and to do that you need to sign up as a or higher supporter on Patreon by January 1st. Everyone who is at the level by January 1st is going to get one of these stickers. And I’m super excited to get those out the door and get them to you. They are so awesome—I’m holding one right now.
And finally: when is The End of Time and Other Bothers back? Well, starting on January 13th, we are back every two weeks on our normal schedule and we can’t wait for you to hear these next three episodes. We’ve already got them in the can and Episode 18 is probably my favourite episode we’ve ever recorded.
So that’s it. A final thank you from myself and from Eli and from the whole table. And we’re gonna get you back to the episode.
MIDROLL: NEW IDEA:
Music sting.
SEA:
(yawning)
Okay, who brought the coffee.
MIK:
I got the pot right here.
SEA:
All right.
MARIS:
I don’t like coffee.
SEA:
I know. Yeah.
MIK:
Yeah, we’ll get some tea.
SEA:
We’ll get some tea. I’ll get some tea in a second. Sorry, Mees, you have said that before. OK. So we’re here to talk about the next arc because you guys have broken the first arc?
MIK:
Mm hmm.
SEA:
So who’s got some ideas?
CARTE:
We play the game separately.
SEA:
Like, split the party?
CARTE:
Yeah. So Blat’s got a plot and then Darcy and Eggerton have a plot.
SEA:
Okay, I’m seeing this.
CARTE:
Okay. And then, eventually they get back together? I don’t know how.
SEA:
Okay, okay, I like that. That’s a good start.
MIK:
Yeah, we can see how that works.
MARIS:
No.
SEA:
What?
MARIS:
Bzzzt. Don’t like it.
SEA:
Okay. All right. What else you got?
MARIS:
I might feel better once I’ve had some tea.
SEA:
It is a little silly to break the party. Come on.
MIK:
Yeah. What if we bring the tea into it? And they have to get some kind of special tea for Moira?
SEA:
(gasps)
Oh maybe—Moira.
MIK:
Yeah.
CARTE:
Moira.
SEA:
She’s changing things and she brings in these knights? And we’re not really sure what she’s up to, there’s all this espionage…
MARIS:
Moira? You can’t even say her name. I don’t think we should give her more stuff to do. You know if I were to rate and review you on iTunes, you wouldn’t be getting a very high rating, guys. Come on. Raise the bar. Raise the bar.
(imitates squeaking of a crank)
Raise the bar.
CARTE:
Okay. We do an episode. It’s just the Quartermaster.
SEA:
(gasps)
Pfillllll-thi-tckkkkt?
MIK:
Ohhh.
CARTE:
Yeah it’s just him, and if he’s ever in a jam, he just pulls out an object.
SEA:
I think it might be a “they”.
CARTE:
They—just pulls out object out from inside of them…
MIK:
That’s so cool.
CARTE:
And then that gets them out of whatever jam they’re in.
MARIS:
I do like the Quartermaster.
SEA:
(enthusiastically)
Huh? Huh?
MARIS:
They’re kind of adorable.
SEA:
Huh??
CARTE:
All right. Well let’s cue the Quartermaster vocal sound effects! Bloop-bloop-bloop!
The Quartermaster’s synthesizer music.
SEA:
(slurping noises)
MARIS:
No, you’re right, it’s not going to work. Forget it.
Groans.
MARIS:
So close. So close.
MIK:
Well, you know what we can always do, is just go to patreon.com/albasalix, and you know, engage with the people on our Discord and try to come up with some ideas, or you know, offer them some cool other perks, like early access to episodes and things like that.
MARIS:
Or T‑shirts.
MIK:
Or T‑shirts. Maybe we can do a special contest at some point for Patreon subscribers.
SEA:
(gasps)
That’s a great idea.
MARIS:
That’s actually a good idea, Mike.
MIK:
What?!
MARIS:
I think you win the prize.
MIK:
I win! Yeah!
SEA:
Yay! Meeting’s over!
MIK:
What do I win?
MARIS:
Tea?
Music sting.
BLAT’S REPOR:
SEA:
We cut to high above Celene’s fortress. But on this evening, it is shining blue. It is formed out of ice and the light shifts across it as the moon strikes it and radiates off in every direction.
And we come down into the biggest tower, where Celene is laying in a bed, as a certain individual gives his report.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hi-diddly-ho, Celene. It’s time for report number 12FG-dash‑X!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(purring seductively)
Oh, I love your reports so much, Blat! Please… talk to me about progress and, mmmm, the accomplishments and… all the little bylines in your report.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So! As you can see on this map here we have 47 different locations for prospective Goddess of the Moon Temples, supplanting three different religions or/and cults that were in that area. Now, what I find particularly interesting is that this one here you see—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Come. Keep talking, but sit right here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughing nervously)
Oh, right. That’s not… strange at all. Um, the northernmost one here, you can see the drawing of it—I saw a drawing of this as a child, I seem to recall! So it seems that I’ve actually altered time. And, uh, I remember witnessing this as an old temple from a history book, and—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes, yes, yes. How many of these temples now have you put in place.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, 47 are, I think good choices. I’m about to go to the first one now. I thought it would be best if I just tried to convince them to turn over to your religion instead of whatever silly current religion that they have going now, blah blah blah, god or goddess, blah blah.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(laughs)
Yes, and no, we don’t need this report. Tell me, Blat…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s why I was supposed to come in here.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Mmm hmm? Tell me, when you go and talk to them, what are you going to say about little old Celene?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! That’s simple. I’m just going to try to convince them, without much difficulty, that your religion is the absolute best religion. And if they try to fight back I’ll say, well, I tried to resist, but that turned out… so very badly.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Did it? Did it, Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…Well, not badly, perhaps that’s a poor choice of words, but it’s just that, uh… I am now in your employ for, uh… the rest of time.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So why fight it? Just come on over to the Moony side and forget about your past life and whatever else you may have believed in.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
So, it’s Festival in so many of my kingdoms today.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is it?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I can’t tell, we’re so high up. They’re like ants down there! Look at them.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes, aren’t they? Come. Come to the window. Yes. Look out across what is our kingdom, is it not, Blat? Our growing kingdom?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I know I’ve been given a file room. I wasn’t told that I was getting a kingdom at all. There is a bit of a problem with the heat in the file room, I was meaning to tell you about that.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Is there?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s a wee bit chilly, and for some reason you won’t let me wear clothing. Heh.
So, I was just wondering, you know, either/or: heat? clothing? both would be best, but I realize that that might not be a possibility.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You are such a strange one. So, Blat. What should we do in this Winter Festival to celebrate? What decree would you make.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I actually wasn’t going to stay for the festival. Like I said, I was going to go and try to convince one of these 47 locations that you should get over to the Goddess of the Moon side! And I was going to start with this furthest one on the map, all the way over here!
(stretches and grunts)
So I’m going to have to go do that right now if I’m going to make it in time.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So! If you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to pack some bags—with what, I don’t know, since I’m not allowed clothing. But… yup! Gonna have to head on out and make sure that I get there as quickly as possible, and—oh! The door seems to be locked. I don’t know how that happened, ha ha ha.
Perhaps you could just, uh, jingle jangle this lock and I’ll be on my way.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I asked you for a decree, Blat. You could do create anything. Anything in these lands of mine, you could decree on this Festival day.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
An open door!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(pouting)
Very well. All doors shall be open to you on Festival day.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, that hopefully is not a euphemism—I’m just going to try this lock one more time. That still seems to be stuck! I don’t know what the problem is.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(dangerous)
I could take what I wanted Blat. I could make it happen. But no. No.
I am going to break you. It may take years. It might take decades. But you will crawl to me, Blat. You will crawl to me one day.
Oh look, the door is unstuck.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Good. Well, heh, once again, it’s been a very awkward meeting, so I’ll just continue traveling the land, and try to convince everyone that you’re the ultimate leader of everything—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
In this report, Blat, I don’t want 47 possibles. I don’t want this far northern kingdom.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You don’t want the far northern kingdom? But I told you, I saw this in a—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(booming)
I want Oracle Idris. Show me a plan that gives me Oracle Idris, Blat. The one you gave away.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, right. The reason why I’m here. Um, that might be a—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
That might be what, Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…a definite possibility for the next report! Absolutely!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Perfect.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll get these pesky first 47 out of the way, and then we’ll circle on back to… the one thing that I did as a free demon. Okay! Good meeting. So… uh, next time, if you could have something else on, other that the see-through gown, that would be appreciated, and—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I got you something, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is it clothing?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
No.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Not really.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughs)
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Here. Open it when you’re alone.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. It’s not a very large package, but… well, like I said, pitter patter, let’s get at ‘er. I gotta—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Happy Festival, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, Happy Festival to you too, Celene. I’ll just, uh… do you want the door open or closed? I’ll just close it. That’s—that’s fine. All right! Ta ta for now!
SEA:
As Blat steps out into the hall, and the door closes behind, and everything dematerializes—and you’re suddenly standing in your filing room, which you’re getting used to now, this constant transformation of movement.
And you see Vardia, the book, who is assisting you, scurrying around, clasping papers between its little tiny hands that stick out of the leaves of the book. And it’s attempting to file, badly.
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
(mumbling)
Hum, hum, goes in 3, goes in 4… this is an A. Is that a B? Okay—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, Vardia—
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
(startled)
Oh! Aaaa!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(just as startled)
Aaaaa! Don’t do that!
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
(gruff and befuddled)
Sorry, Blat! I’ve got, uh—I think I’ve filed all of two thousand one hundred and seventy three, and the year of the Goddess’s birth, but I think I got it done.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, let’s just do a double check here. Let’s see.
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
All right. Yeah.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, so… A. Good.
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
Yeah?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
B. Good. And… R. How—you’re a book! How is this hard?! There’s letters inside of you! Why is this so confusing?
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
Well, R comes after B!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There’s a bunch of stuff in between!
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
Oh, I know, but I had an R and I needed to file it! I didn’t have the other stuff yet, see. Maybe I should go back to collating. I’m really good at collating.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. All right, go back to collating.
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
Oh yes. Thank you. Oh, thank you, Blat. I’ll just collate. Do you need anything? Can I collate your shoes?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, uh…
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
Oh! You got a package! Should I collate that?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I… God in heaven, yes. Collate this and be sure to lose it. I don’t even want to open it to know what’s inside it. It’s probably something that’s studded, or…
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
I’ll file it! I’ll file it now.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Good. Very good. Make sure not to find it again.
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
And the report? How did the report go, Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I don’t think she’s actually that interested in me spreading the word of the Goddess of the Moon, but she’d like me to spread something else—we’re not going to get into that because I don’t want that to happen! If we just concentrate on filing and collating and asking people to supplant all of their beliefs, we’ll be able to hopefully delay the last thing as long as possible.
Now! I’m going to remove these bedsheets from my bed… and then, if I just cut a couple of slits here and here, this could possibly pass as clothing.
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
Yes, it’s quite striking, quite striking.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Maybe I could just say that this is what the Moon people wear. Which is more than what their goddess wears. Ugh, why does everything have to be see-through on her.
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
(alarmed)
You met with Celene?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, I—
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
Herself?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah, up close and in person and in the flesh and all of that. Have you never met Celene?
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
(screams in terror)
Aaaagh!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Aaa! All right, all right!
SEA:
He slams closed and hits the floor.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
I wish I had your relationship with her.
CARTE:
And Blat picks him up, files him on a shelf…
SEA:
(laughs)
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
(muffled)
Oh, thank you!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Good night…
SEAN (AS VARDIA)
(muffled)
Good night, Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ll see you when I get back.
CARTE:
Blat opens the window in his filing room tower, looks out on the cold winter Festival night, spreads his wings and flies off to the northernmost part of the map, to reach the first temple, to do his job.
NOCTURN:
A melancholy rendition of the theme on electric guitar and glockenspiel.
SEA:
We cut to another individual looking out a window, across the winter grounds—and it is a flightless fairy.
He has the window cracked half open and behind him, half in her bed and half on the floor, Darcy is snoring. And he’s looking out over the festivities and the people in the town that are partying.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, Blat.
(sighs)
It’s so quiet without you. So used to sitting and listening to you talk and explain things and file things and explain filing and alphabetizing and itemizing and prioritizing and all the other zings. Then explaining what each one of them means, and getting frustrated with poor Snegal when he tries to help.
It’s gonna be weird here without you, Blat. I’m trying to keep the team together. Moira’s having a hard time. She seems to have brought on a whole bunch of helpers. I don’t know if she forgot that I’m here. But I’ll try and be their leader too, and get them out into the field, doing calisthenics and stretching out before we go to war with the Shattering.
Darcy’s just all over the place. I guess her overwhelming love for me has gotten too intense without you here to ground her. Snegal got into the fairy wine. I won’t touch the stuff—it really messes with your head, and I would never want to do anything like that. But tomorrow we go to war, I’ve been told, and I’ve never been in a fight. Except for that time with the zombies, and that other time with a slot and the whole thing in the void with…
SEA:
And we pull away from the window, up into the sky, as we leave Eggerton as he continues to build up his resolve into the night air.
And we see a shadow flit through the air, as a large man-sized creature with wings circles the school twice before flying off to the north.
ANANKA’S HU:
Soft wind chimes. We are picking up where we left Greg and Ananka in Episode 9.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
(furious)
I came back for this? I thought you were helping! I thought you and me were on the same page!
(growls)
SEAN (AS GREG)
Ananka—at least put down the sword.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Hmmm.
SEAN (AS GREG)
At least for a moment. I’m not armed.
She drops the sword with a clank.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
And always remember. I can still hurt you, weapon or not.
SEAN (AS GREG)
I know. Ananka, I… I still don’t know if you’re in on this.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
You don’t know if I’m in on this?! What the hell does that mean?
SEAN (AS GREG)
Moira is building another bomb.
Silence.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
What? No.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Yes. I’ve seen it. In Steadfast, when I went to get Darcy. She’s rebuilding the Hall of Wonders.
I should back up. I helped to build the first bomb. I didn’t know it’s what I was doing. It’s why I crossed over and told the Shattering. The Nexus was building a bomb. you’ve seen it—the Event. That wasn’t the Shattering, Ananka. That was the Nexus.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
I don’t even…
SEAN (AS GREG)
Maybe you should sit down. Maybe I should sit down.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
What are we supposed to do now? I can’t even trust my sister. Is this what you are telling me?
SEAN (AS GREG)
That’s what I was hoping to hear. I know that’s awful.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
And I’m supposed to trust you now?
SEAN (AS GREG)
I didn’t tell you, so I can understand if you don’t trust me. After… after the Event I told Moira what I’d done. And I told her everything I knew about the bomb that was being built, the genocide the Nexus was planning, to eliminate the Shattering forever. And I told her that this was against my vow, as a hunter, for balance. And she swore me to silence. She thanked me. But Ananka—she’s using the three that you had me get to build the bomb again.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
And I’ve been helping her this entire time train these people for…
SEAN (AS GREG)
It gets worse.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
How can how can I be so blind?
SEAN (AS GREG)
I don’t know.
I was caught just as off guard as you were. I trusted her. I trusted you and both your sisters.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
And my sight was wrong—what if she had something to do with that?
SEAN (AS GREG)
I don’t know. I think she sent you on this errand at this time on purpose. She wanted you away for whatever she’s planning right now.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
And she came for me. I think she expected me to die—needed me to die. I don’t think she expected you to come and rescue me on that one-way mission.
(sighs)
Well, I suppose the one thing that she did not know is that… I love you, Grishka. and I never will stop loving you.
SEAN (AS GREG)
I’ve never stopped loving you, Ananka. Don’t put your sword away. I think we’re going to need it.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Let’s fight together.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Thank you. We can’t go back though, right now. She is raising new warriors. The dead. The Knights walk again. I barely escaped. You can’t just walk back in there. We need allies.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
The three.
SEAN (AS GREG)
I hope your trust in them is not misplaced, Ananka.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
You know, I know I haven’t been spot-on with a lot of the visions. But if there is one thing I can always sense, it’s a good heart. And I know their intentions are pure and I have faith. Who else can we trust? There’s no one but you and me and…
SEAN (AS GREG)
And your other sister.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
Of course.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Maybe it’s time we bridge that separation.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
No better time than now.

Hi Snegal!

Wait. Where’s Blat?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(drunk)
Moira!! You came to the party!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I’m really sorry, everyone, to do this during Winter Festival. But we are at war. The Shattering has moved against us, as has my sister.
SEAN (AS GREG)
Moira is building another bomb.
MAGGIE (AS ANANKA)
What?
SEA:
Pair after pair of giant knights in full plate mail march into the room until fifty of them line the walls.
SEAN (AS GREG)
The Nexus was planning, to eliminate the Shattering forever. And she swore me to silence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat’s just gone, Snegal, he’s never coming back. He’s become the Moon Goddess’s concubine or something like that, and you’re never gonna see him again.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
As you can see on this map here we have 47 different locations for prospective Goddess of the Moon Temples—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(booming)
I want Oracle Idris. Show me a plan that gives me Oracle Idris, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Absolutely! I’ll get these pesky first 47 out of the way, and then we’ll circle on back to… the one thing that I did as a free demon. Okay! Good meeting.
DOOR TO DOO:
SEA:
Blat pulls the sheet tighter around him as he steps out into streets that are gold. And more than one glance is directed his way as the people here are dressed to the nines, everything accentuated in special jewellery and stunning footwear.
And he approaches an ornate door that reads with a small plaque: “The Fashionistas”.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh well, I thought this was a nice looking bedsheet but… whatever.
CARTE:
Blat knocks upon the door.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Coming!
The door opens.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, yes. Uh… hello. Why… aren’t you well put together. I bid you news from the south!
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
(gasps)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, very exciting. I was wondering if perhaps…
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
(in awe)
Oh! Your outfit.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uhhh… yes… my outfit.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
I’ve never seen anything… like it!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, yes. It’s… quite simplistic, but it keeps me, uh, very cold.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
It is a statement against our very modern sensibilities of fashion!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uhh…
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Its very simplicity!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I suppose so.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Now, I might suggest some type of footwear to go with it and perhaps a simple earring. But no, no, I see. You stand even against that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well no… if you had some shoes that I could wear it would be…
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Oh come in, come in! Welcome to our humble church.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh, that’s…
SEA:
You step in and there is just mosaics and colour and everything. There are cloaks hanging from every beam.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, it’s not actually so simple. This is actually quite a… uh… lovely building that you have here.
So are you willing to give it all up?
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
(gasps)
Are you here to walk?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The… runway?
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… noooo. What I’m actually here for…
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
But you must! Come. Enrico! Enrico… you must see this!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(protesting)
No, No… Enrico… I…
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
It is like nothing I have ever seen!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no… I’m not actually… no… see what I’m trying to do my good man is to try to talk you out of whatever you folks worship in order to get down with the Goddess of the Moon!
So those shoes… am I getting those now or do I have to wait a little bit?

Come, get ready! We’ll get you in makeup…
(gasps)
No… makeup is too much! I get it! It is brilliant!
Come to the back. Meet the girls.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was hoping for some shoes. My feet are quite uncomfortable. Oh… hello ladies! So, who here likes the moon?!
SEAN (AS MODEL)
(giggling)
Oh… hee hee hee… I like the moon!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Allllriiight… how would you like to worship the moon instead of, umm… fashion?
SEAN (AS MODEL)
(suggestively)
I’ll worship you, baby, sometime.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(nervous laughter)
Alllriiighht. Oh… you don’t appear to be worshipping clothing at all at the moment. I’m terribly sorry. I shall avert my gaze. I… I…
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Martha! Get in a dress. Get in your dress! Please. Oh my… I’m so proud to have you here. Oh, we must have a name for your outfit, to put it on the program.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, well… this is actually just a bedsheet so… uh, do you folks not have bed sheets in this village?
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Of course! Made of the thousand finest silks.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well… this is definitely material of some sort—
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Woven by the silk spiders themselves!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Umm… well, it actually looks like some sort of large animal vomited this one up but, it is a bedsheet. Anyway! So, back to the moon.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Ahhh. Bedsheet. Brilliant. Our very dreams brought to their basest reality.
A pause.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sure! Like that.
So, uh… what also happens in your dreams, is that you dream at night, and at night the moon comes out! The moon is really what you folks should be worshipping.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Ahhh… yes, yes! Enrico! Prepare a single blue light as if the moon glinted off the fresh fallen snow!
That is what you will walk out in the runway in.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… snow?
(pause)
Oh… the blue light! I’m sorry… I… uh…
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
No… we will put snow! Enrico, prepare a field of snow on the runway for… I’m sorry, I did not get your name.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uhh… my name is Blat. Pleased to meet you.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
…for Blat’s entrance.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Umm, again… I’m not sure that I have the time. I’ve got a lot of places I need to see. I’m on a work-related business trip, you see.
Bowie-esque disco music blares, and a crowd cheers.
SEA:
Cut to evening. The place is full of shouts and people screaming and yelling and… cameras going off? I don’t know. All kinds of strobes and flashes… and we are backstage.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Ahh… there you are Blat. Perfection. Are you ready for your moment?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uhh… I suppose. I’ve never done this sort of thing before. I was just hoping to talk to whatever priest or minister administers to this place.
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
You will be speaking to the flock as you step out with your statement.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, well, that’s good! That’s very good. Get everybody at once. All right, let’s get to this. I just didn’t expect there to be so much strobe lighting and large music…
SEAN (AS FASHIONISTA)
Wait! There it is. The hoot of the owl. The blue light, the fresh fallen snow.
The runway is yours.
Silence.
SEAN (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #1)
(whispering)
What’s happening? I don’t know what’s happening. What’s happening?
MARISA (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #2)
(whispering)
I don’t know. I really don’t know what’s happening.
MIKE (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #3)
(whispering)
Why’s this so weird?
SEAN (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #1)
(whispering)
It must be… I’ve never… it must be something special.
MIKE (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #3)
(whispering)
It’s so strange.
MARISA (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #2)
So strange.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Helloooo! Fashionistas!
SEAN (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #1)
What is he wearing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This… is what I sleep on!
I’ve wrapped it around my body simply.
MARISA (AS OLD FASHIONISTA)
Heathen!
MIKE (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #3)
(whispering)
I don’t get it.
SEAN (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #1)
What. It’s just a bedsheet.
MARISA (AS OLD FASHIONISTA)
Sacrilege!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh. I was hoping perhaps to convince you fine, well-dressed people if instead of worshipping… clothing, I guess? That’s a little odd. Anyway… instead, worshipping… Celene!
SEAN (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #1)
What do you take us for?! It’s a sheet!
MARISA (AS OLD FASHIONISTA)
Burn the sheet!
MIKE (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #3)
Take it off!
SEAN (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #1)
Burn the demon!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No… no… alright. There’s no need to burn the demon. Who likes the moon? Show of hands? You?
SEAN (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #1)
Get him!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(unintelligible screaming)
OH NO! Oh my Lord in Heaven!
MIKE (AS AUDIENCE MEMBER #3)
I’ve got a pitchfork!
BRENDA’S COTTAG:
MARIS:
Blat stands in front of a door of a homey looking cottage, with some really delectable smells coming out of it. It’s a sweet-looking cottage with shutters and a very homey feel to it.
And he knocks on the door and a middle-aged woman bustles over, opens it and welcomes him in.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
(midwestern US accent)
Well, hello there! Welcome to Brenda’s kitchen. Oh my goodness! Another visitor here to feed his stomach and his soul? Come on in. Come on in.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… I’m sorry. Are you… are you Brenda?
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh, I am Brenda, indeed. Who might you be?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m sorry. I just thought this was a house of worship. Uh… my name is Blat.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh, it is a house of worship.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Oh good.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh, it’s true. It’s where many people come to worship my soup and my biscuits and…
(modest chuckle)
Well, me, actually. Good old Brenda.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So you’re the chief religious figure of this area, and you make bread and soups.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh honey, you put it in such a high-falutin’ way. We just like to think of it as I’m the heart and soul of my people around here.
Come, come, sit down. I’m gonna make you some soup. Here we go. Here we go. Let me just ladle this into a bowl for you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So you don’t have any strong opinions about clothing, do you?
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh no! In fact what you’re wearing, it looks like you’ve been through the wringer! It’s all ripped up and torn and dirty. I wonder what happened to you!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was attacked by supermodels.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But anyway, um… that’s fine. Um, Brenda, how do you feel about the moon?
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh, I don’t give the moon much thought there at all.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhh, but what if I were to tell you that the moon thinks a lot about you?
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
(gasps)
Does it?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And perhaps the moon thinks you’re spending far too much time making soup and biscuits instead of thinking about the moon.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Well now, I don’t know if you’d think that after you sip some of this soup and have one of my biscuits!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Biscuits?
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh yummy, yummy, yummy!
(over Blat’s objections)
Put that… nope, put that in your mouth. Put it in your mouth. Put it in your mouth. In your mouth. In your…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(muffled eating sounds)
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
There we go!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, that IS tasty.
Sean bursts into song, matched by a heavenly choir.
SEAN (AS HEAVENLY CHOIR)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh… AHHHHHHHH!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Does this happen every time?
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
And now you have communed with Brenda.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhhh.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Welcome.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Welcome. So… uh… what can I help you with Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m here to politely inform you that everything that you believe is wrong and that instead you should be worshipping Celene, the Goddess of the Moon. Now I have some paperwork here…
SEAN (AS CAULDRON)
(low, dangerous rumbling)
Garngle garngle garn gurn garn.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh, dear, sorry. That was the cauldron in the back. That’s where all the soup comes from you see.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
For Brenda’s kitchen.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sure… yes, that’s, uh, that’s fine. Well, you see, stowed away here in my torn and battered bedsheet, I just have a little bit of paperwork that you just need to fill out just stating that you… um… I’ll just have to fill this in.
(writing)
“I now forsake: SOUP AND BISCUITS…”
SEAN (AS CAULDRON)
(louder rumbling)
GARNGLE GURN GARN.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh my goodness! We would never forsake our soup and biscuits here. That’s the very foundation of our society!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, you don’t have to stop eating entirely. It’s just that you’ll be spending one day a week really, really thinking about how much the moon is important to you. So if I could just get you to forsake your religious beliefs, that’d be just great and I’ll be on my way.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Blat… is there something hurting your soul? Is there something deep inside that needs a soothing… apple pie?! Huh? Hmmm?
SEA:
(bell sound)
Ting!
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Here you go. Oh, it’s warmed up just for you, just to the temperature you like… boiling hot.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
How did you know… OW… it hurts to touch it. That is just how I like it. Ohhhhhhhhhhhh… this is…
The choir hits an even bigger crescendo than before.
SEAN (AS HEAVENLY CHOIR)
(sings)
Ahhhhhhhh…. AHHHHHHH… AHHHHHHHH!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There that goes again.
Yes, I can see that this is a very strong religion, but um…
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
It goes down piping ‚hot doesn’t it?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It does! It’s burning my tongue… which I always enjoy.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Right down to the depths of your soul, doesn’t it?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(with burnt tongue)
It does indeed.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Giving you the sort of sustenance you need to carry you through life. And to give you the belief you need to move forward and push onwards and leave Brenda’s kitchen feeling like you could take on the whole world!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So is that gonna be a maybe?
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
OK, so bye-bye now.
(over Blat’s protests)
Thanks for coming. Here you are. Take care now. Say bye, cauldron!
SEAN (AS CAULDRON)
Gurngle gurn bye.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Say bye, Heavenly Speakers!
SEAN AND MARISA (AS HEAVENLY CHOIR)
Ahhhhhh…. AHHHHHHHH!!!
MARIS:
And the door slams shut behind him.
CARTE:
Blat sees on the side of the building some paint, just in a small can. Blat dips the paintbrush into the paint, draws a half moon on the door…
SEA:
(imitates thunderclap)
CARTE:
…and then scurries off.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There. Good enough!
DOOMSDA:
MICHAE:
Blat walks up to, you know, a pretty standard looking bureaucratic type building with steel doors, and it just says in small letters, “DDI”, on a brass plaque.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
DDI… DD… nope. I don’t know what this one could be although it does look very professional!
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Uh, uh… hello?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah yes. Helloooo my good man! How do you feel about the moon?
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
(terrified)
Uh… well… uh… is there something wrong with the moon?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Noooo… what’s wrong is your attitude towards it.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Th-th-there’s something wrong with the moon?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no… everything’s… no… everything’s fine with the moon and the moon is good and the moon loves you.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
What? Th-that’s new. That’s… that’s… oh… is this it? This is… this is the sign? You better come inside. Come inside.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, well, thank you very much.
MICHAE:
Heavy door slams shut. And a bar goes across it. Fshoosh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well…
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
Brother, is this the sign?
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
This might… this might be it. Hold on.
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
I will prepare.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Okay, you… you… you get ready. Ahhhh… what… what was your name?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… my name is Blat. And I’m here to talk to you about Celene, the Goddess of the Moon.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
The Goddess… Oh! Oh no, this must be it! It’s here! It’s… OH MY GOD, IT’S HERE! IT’S FINALLY… IT’S THE DOOMSDAY!
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
I’m not ready!
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
IT’S HAPPENING!
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
I’M NOT READY!
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
WE DON’T HAVE TIME!
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
I’M NOT REAAADDDY!
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
WE HAVE TO GET READY TO GO! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!
Widespread panic, weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
IT’S NOT DOOMSDAY! IT’S NOT DOOMSDAY! EVERYBODY STOP SCREAMING! Every… it’s… I have it on good authority that the world is not going to end for thousands of years.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
WE ONLY HAVE THOUSANDS OF YEARS LEFT! EVERYBODY PANIC!
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
(calming down)
Actually… that… that seems like a lot of time.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
(calming down)
Well, wait… is that a Gregorian thousand or a metric thousand?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’ll be dead. Why does it matter?
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
OH MY GOD!
Further weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth.
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
I’M NOT READY TO DIE!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No. NO! NO! NO! Your world’s not going to end IF… you worship the moon.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
I was kind of hoping for a Doomsday.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You… You’re hoping for a Doomsday?
MARISA (AS JANINE)
Well, I’ve been working very hard towards it.
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
I’ve been practising my scream a really long time.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
I’ve been storing a lot of food for it.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Yeah, we’re the Doomsday Iffians. We just, you know, we’re always ready for the Doomsday.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
Yeahhhh….
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You worship the Apocalypse?
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Well, we worship the coming of the Apocalypse, specifically. Some of us and some sects are more about the Apocalypse itself. Like Janine over here. But you know, traditionalists like me… we’re more into if it’s gonna happen today or if it’s gonna happen tomorrow. I mean, that’s where the name comes from. So you know…
MARISA (AS JANINE)
He’s really into the anticipation…
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
That’s where the pleasure comes from.
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
The if. The if is the important part.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Getting right up to the edge…
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
You know… this seems like this is a false alarm. I’m gonna go back to the guard.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Okay, okay… well hey, look—what was your name?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My name’s Blat.
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
Blat? Okay, well look thanks for stopping by. And, you know what? Come again tomorrow. This was a lot of fun…
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
Come again!
(laughs)
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
(laughing along)
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
(laughing)
Like the Apocalypse would come more than once!
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
That’s funny. Wait, could it… could there be more than one Apo… oh… OH!
MARISA (AS JANINE)
Well… if some of us survived the first one then absolutely there could be another…
MICHAEL (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #1)
(hyperventilating)
OH! OH! OH! OH MY GOD!
SEAN (AS DOOMSDAY IFFIAN #2)
He’s hyperventilating!
Mass hysteria ensues.
THE EYE OF RUBI:
SEA:
Blat approaches a rather strange building that appears to be designed as a giant circle. Just a cylinder resting on its side and there is a circular door in the centre of it about 30 feet up, and a little wobbly staircase leading up to that circle in the centre.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
They already worship something circular; my job’s half done. Unless they worship pleather cheese or something…
(gasps)
Which rumour has it the moon is made out of! Ah, this is going to be so easy.
He knocks on the door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hellooo? Hello! Your saviour has come.
SEA:
The eye opens!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Um… hello!
SEA:
Shifts…
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
(deep, booming voice)
Can you step back so I can see you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, um… certainly. Um… helloooo… I’m just uh…
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
The Eye of Rubix sees you!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Great!
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
All of you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All of me? Oh, I’m sorry… the sheet rode up.
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
The things you’ve done.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Huh?
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
THE EYE OF RUBIX JUDGES YOU… wanting.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, that’s a bit rude. I just came here to tell you about how your religion is wrong.
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
Oh, is it? And you believe so fully in the revisions that you bring?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I wouldn’t say I believe…
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
AT ALL! In any of it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… no… not at all. No, I don’t believe in any of this.
I am here for love! And love only. It’s a long story. Anyway, how do you feel about the moon?
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
She is a conniving old witch.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh, absolutely. You nailed that on the head.
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
Ohhhh… the things she’s tried.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh… so much touching.
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
Oh, the luring.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh… the leering.
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
Oh, the tight clothing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, the see-through clothing.
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
Oh, the lack of clothing!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhhh… I wasn’t allowed to wear a thing.
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
Stop showing me that!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh… not again. It rode up again. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It got torn after the first establishment. So, ummm—
SEAN (AS THE EYE OF RUBIX)
Seek help, young friend.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I… I’d like to…
SEA:
And the eye closes.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What would help me is if someone would just once agree to change their religion.
THE SWAM:
MARIS:
Blat finds himself wading through a bog. It’s very foggy around, he can’t see very far in front of him. But he then emerges upon a circle of people kneeling down in this swamp. They appear to just be staring down at the bubbling mass underneath them.
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
(chanting)
Woooaaaahhhh… woooaahhhh… woooaaaahhhh.
MIKE AND SEAN (AS ACOLYTES)
(chanting)
Woooahhhh…. wooooahhhh… wooooahhhh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(wading through mud)
Gahhh…. gahhhh…. gahh!
Sorry… it took me a while to get here. So many signs from the road but you have to walk through all this thick muck. So what are you folks about?
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
Welcome, welcome. You see, it’s the peat moss. It keeps us and rejuvenates us. And it feeds our spirits. Welcome, new worshipper.
SEAN (AS ACOLYTE)
(chanting)
Welcooooome.
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
What… how can we help you find what you seek?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You people worship peat moss?
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
We do, we do. We bathe in it each evening.
Woooahhh. Woooahhh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You know what is helping you see this peat moss? Up there in the sky! It’s the moon! So… if you can’t worship peat moss without the moon, doesn’t that make the moon greater than peat moss? And then doesn’t that mean… we should instead be worshipping the moon?
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
Yeah, sure… this is really just mud. Absolutely.
MIKE AND SEAN (AS ACOLYTES)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
Where do I sign?
MIKE AND SEAN (AS ACOLYTES)
Where do we sign? Where do we sign?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh well…
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
I’m filthy really.
MIKE AND SEAN (AS ACOLYTES)
I’m tired of this. I’m tired of this.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, so I forsake peat moss. Why… why…
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
Yeah. Why didn’t you turn up like five years ago? Where have you been?
SEAN (AS ACOLYTE)
We’ve been waiting a long time.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m very sorry about this. And so… um… her name’s Celene and… uh… every so often look upwards I guess?
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
His name is Gronk so we’re much happier with Celene.
SEAN (AS ACOLYTE)
Yeah, that’s really good actually.
MIKE (AS ACOLYTE)
Celeeeene.
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
It’s almost, uh, musical.
SEAN (AS ACOLYTE)
Can we get our feet out of the water?
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
Yeah…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, absolutely…. no… head to the main road.
MARISA (AS PRIESTESS)
I think we’re getting the flu actually.
SEAN (AS ACOLYTE)
(sneezes)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(writing)
“Down with Gronk.” Ooookay… great! That’s finally a win!
TREVOR:
MICHAE:
Blat approaches a house with peeling paint and a door that’s kind of hanging on the hinges a little bit. It’s worn, so it’s swinging open slightly too.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, well apparently they’re not collecting funds from their parishioners.
CARTE:
Blat knocks on the door, which then falls to the ground.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Oh Lord.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Hey, what’s up, bro?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, hello… “bro”. Ah. Just came to talk to your… um… head. Whoever’s—
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Oh, I’ve got a head. Ha ha.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m certain you do. Uh… I was wondering if I could talk to…
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
You wanna beer?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uhhh…
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Come on in, man. We’ve got a keg going.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… you have a keg going?
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Hey, look, you know, I’m Trevor. It’s nice to meet you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… hi Trevor. It’s 10 o’clock in the morning. You’re…
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Is it already? Hey Trevor! It’s time for your keg stand!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I…
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Hey dude… really?
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
I thought I just did it.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Broseph.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Ohhhh, Broseph!
(laughs)
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Come on, bro.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
OK… I’ll get it ready.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Alright, come on… come sit in here. Just wipe off this chesterfield here a little bit and you can sit there.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
Don’t you mean the Trevorfield?
Frat boy laughter from the Multi-Trevors.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Good one, Trevor.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
Thanks.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, I’ve noticed that you’re all named Trevor?
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Uhhh… yeah. We’re Trevorites.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’re Trevorites?
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Yeah, this is our Trevor House.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
Surely you’re Trevor too.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Can you hold this funnel, dude?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sure, I’ll hold the funnel…
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Okay, I’ll get your legs. What? Hold on. Hold on. We gotta get Trevor on his keg stand. Okay, ready?
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Hold on.
(psyching himself up)
Ready!
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Alright… up you go!
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
YAAHHHHHH!! Give me the funnel!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, here’s the funnel! Here’s the funnel!
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
(with funnel in mouth)
Pour the beer dude!
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Come on Trevor. OK, Trevor… grab a beer quick.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
Yeah, OK… I got it… I got it. Here we go. Here we go! Here we go!
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Aaaaand… ah… it’s the whole thing! Alright, there you go.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
AMAAAZING, Trevor.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Alright Bro. New Bro, New Bro… wait, wait, let’s get New Bro to do one. New Bro… come here, Bro.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh well… you see, Trevors… bro… I was actually hoping to talk to you about the moon.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
You mean Trevor’s butt?
Multi-Trevor frat laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, oh…
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Moon time!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That is… wicked.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
We’re always seein’ the moon.
More laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ha ha. Yes, I was referring to actually the one in the sky. Did you know that there’s a cool, new, totally “rad” religion around it?
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
What? Is it zesty flavoured?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Absolutely.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Awesome. Gnarly.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… gnarly to the max bro.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Wait, wait bro… we should check. Can you drink it?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You know, I think if you figure out a way to get up there, there’ll be something to drink. But what I was hoping to get from you… browensteins is—
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Whoa.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
That’s not cool, bro.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Not cool at all.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Alright? Watch yourself.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Come on.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m… I’m sorry. Is that a slur? I’m just trying to fit in.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
You know what? Not knowing is not an excuse.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry…
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
‘Kay… Bro? Bro?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah?
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Bro? Hold me back, bro.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
I’m holding you back, bro.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Hold me back, bro.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
I’m holding you back in my head, bro.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Alright, bro, I think it’s time for you to… you know… make like a leaf.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And?
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Grow.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
Exit.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Leaf?
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Grow.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
What? What are you talking… Just go, man.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
Get out.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Oh… I thought it was “grow”.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
Get out.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Like you know… improve yourself.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Trevor, we’ve been over this.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Like grow and improve himself.
MARISA (AS TREVOR #3)
We want him to exit.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
No, this isn’t the time.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
He could use that.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
He could.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Yeah.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
But not here.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Alright. I gotcha, bro… I gotcha.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
We’ve got our own priorities.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Hold me back, bro!
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
I’m holding you back!
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
Yeah! You better get out of here like a leaf!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I… I’m not sure that means what you think it does. Alright, so… uh, that’s a maybe on the moon? Uh…
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Wait, wait, wait. Here’s a moon for you.
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
(frat boy scream)
YAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
MIKE AND MARISA (AS TREVOR #1 AND #2)
(hooting and hollering)
SEAN (AS TREVOR #2)
I totally didn’t see that comin’, bro.
MICHAEL (AS TREVOR #1)
Yeah, bro, that was real original, ‘cuz it just popped in my head. No one said it earlier or nothin’.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I used to like my life.
MIDROL:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of the End of Time and Other Bothers!
EL:
Hey, everyone, it’s Eli here, stepping out from behind the soundboard to bring you this week’s announcements. And first up, it’s just good to be back. Hi!
We’re now recording new episodes in our upstairs game rooms studio. And I’m back downstairs making all the noises and music for it, and having a blast to be honest. We are back on our every-two-weeks schedule. So look for new episodes every other Sunday. Or if you are a Patreon supporter of ours at the or greater level, you can hear them three days early. Learn how to do that at otherbothers.com. Just scroll down and look for the big button that says “Become a Patron”.
The other big news is we’re gonna be at PodCon in, good grief, just a few days. That’s in Seattle, Washington and it’s a festival of podcasting for creators and fans alike. And we’re gonna have a table there full of merch and Sean’s gonna be chattin’ with people about Patreon and how we use it. I’m there to answer any questions about writing or sound design or all those things. Just come up, say hi! It’s gonna be a really good time. We’re so looking forward to seeing you all there.
If, alas, you can’t make it, we are going to be posting highlights and photos and videos from our trip on our Instagram at instagram.com/alba_salix. You can find links to that on otherbothers.com as well.
That’s it for now; on with the rest of the midroll.
MIDROLL: WARMING U:
MICHAE:
Uh… so the weather’s kind of cold outside and that makes me want to go inside and warm up. What’s a way that you like to warm up inside audience?
SEA:
Cocoa.
MICHAE:
Cocoa… I heard cocoa.
MARIS:
What’s happening?
SEA:
He’s getting offers.
CARTE:
Clothing.
MICHAE:
Clothing. Oh, yeah, yeah. Who likes clothes? Now, tell me, what kind of clothing do you like, sir?
CARTE:
I like… warm clothing.
MICHAE:
Warm clothing. And what part of your body do you put it on first?
CARTE:
First?
MICHAE:
First.
CARTE:
Underpants.
MICHAE:
Underpants.
SEAN AND MIK:
Warm underpants. That’s our offer.
MICHAE:
Thanks very much and enjoy the show.
Sean knocks on a door.
SEA:
Michael!
MICHAE:
Yeah… yeah, come on in.
SEA:
Hey. Oh, hey… oh um yeah. OK… so I’ll just face this way. Uh sorry…. I didn’t realize you weren’t dressed yet.
MICHAE:
Well, no, I’m wearing this new bra…
SEA:
Yeah. So I’m just checking… uh…
MICHAE:
It’s got a heated underwire.
SEA:
Yeah, great. Um, is there anything you need or want? Uh… we’re up in 10. I’m just getting everything ready in the green room.
MICHAE:
Uh… well… what did Carter ask for this time?
SEA:
Water and something crunchy, salty, sweet and soft.
MICHAE:
Can I have the same thing?
SEA:
Yes.
MICHAE:
But 10% more.
SEA:
Yes, you can. Okay, here we go.
Marisa!
He knocks on the next door.
MARIS:
Leave me alone.
SEA:
Okay, I’ll stay out here. Um… I just want to know if you want anything…
MARIS:
I don’t want anything.
SEA:
Um, are you OK? Maybe eight minutes in the green room?
MARIS:
Fifteen.
SEA:
Right, right. Fifteen. I’ll let everyone know fifteen.
Carter?
He knocks on another door.
CARTE:
Yo!
SEA:
Uh… just… it’s gonna be 15 minutes.
CARTE:
Do you have the soft, crunchy…
MARIS:
THIRTY-FIVE!
SEA:
Thirty-five minutes. Is that OK with you Carter?
CARTE:
Thirty… thirty-five minutes?
SEA:
Would you mind telling Michael that call time’s now in 35 minutes?
CARTE:
Alright… uh…
SEA:
Okay, gotta go!
CARTE:
Mike!
MICHAE:
What!?
CARTE:
Stick your head out your window!
MICHAE:
I can’t… I’m doing yoga.
CARTE:
Ohhhh… it’s gonna be 35 minutes!
MICHAE:
Yeah, it seems about how long it’ll take for this whole thing to go off the rails!
CARTE:
Nah… I think it’s gone off the rails now.
MICHAE:
I feel like we started with something of a weak premise!
CARTE:
Uh-huh?
MICHAE:
And then I tried to force it to go one way. And it really just bummed everybody out.
CARTE:
Oh… so you did that thing that you’re not supposed to do in improv where you just sorta shove the joke into the premise.
MICHAE:
Yup… pretty much. I don’t think it worked.
CARTE:
Sooooo… instead, you should just go with the flow and see what comes up naturally.
MICHAE:
No, no, I’m pretty sure that’s not what you do in improv.
CARTE:
Okay.
MICHAE:
But you know what, I bet if people were to donate at patreon.com/albasalix we could get some books on improv.
CARTE:
I see.
MICHAE:
I’m wearing a bra.
CARTE:
Ahhhhhh.
SEA:
Scene!
SPRAW:
SEA:
Blat is standing in front of a strip mall that appears to go on forever in infinity, and no matter which direction he turns, the strip mall just continues.
There are honking cars. A car almost hits him every 30 seconds. There are strange crossing walks that change very rapidly and randomly, and people scream as cars zoom by.
And there is a figure standing there with a hooded robe and no face.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, that’s rather interesting. No face. Ohhhh, perhaps these are the Shadowborn that I met earlier. I’ll have to steel myself but everything seems so advanced. This almost seems like stuff from my time. Ah, well… um… hellooo?
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
(distorted, as if over a speaker)
Hmmmm… who approaches?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, ’tis I… Blat… uh… I’m here to talk to you about… um… ah..oh lord… religion. He-Hello?
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
Who approaches?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… Blat… I’m here to talk to you about religion. Helloo?
SEAN (AS THE VOICE)
(in exactly the same tone)
Who approaches?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Alright… so it’s an entire…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Sorry, hold on a second!
SEA:
This man steps out from behind:
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Our speaker system’s always breaking.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh good… I was wondering…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
I’ll just tinker with it while you… sorry… go ahead.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, I’m here to speak to you about the moon.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Uh yeah… that’s great.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, the moon IS great. And I was wondering if perhaps you here in your little, um, strip mall would like to…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Little?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…base an entire religion around it!
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Did you say the word little?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well I…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
You referred to our mecca of sprawl with the word “little”.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I was just trying to be humorous because it’s so large. It’s, um, actually one of the biggest things that I’ve ever seen. And I’ve been on the moon!
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Oh. I expect you could… see us from the moon.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If I had been looking in the right direction, yes.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Ohhh good.
(cackling)
Good. Yes! YES! YEESSS! It sounds much better through the speaker.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah, it does. It does. I’ve actually, uh, developed a slight earache. Umm…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Have you considered opening a shop?
(gasp)
Or a strip mall yourself?
(gasp)
Or an expansion? Or a housing department that… faces your office? We can do it all. We can give you all the land you want.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, no, I’m not ready to open an outlet store just yet.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
WHAT?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Because I’m merely in front of you wearing a torn bedsheet!
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
We don’t have homeless people here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uhh…
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
(frantic)
Excuse me. Excuse me, oh Grand Sprawler!
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Ah yes.
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
Oh Grand Sprawler…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Yes.
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
I must tell you something that is very, very unhappy.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Ohh…
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
There is a small patch of forest and bunnies. Yea, yonder.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Where?!
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
I know Grand Sprawler. I do not want to be the one to bring you this news but the bunny and the trees…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
NO! NO!
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
They frighten me…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
NO!
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
Please do something.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
We will… we will gather the Council at once. I’m sorry friend. We have a despicable thing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You know what you should build there… a temple that worships Celene, the Goddess of the Moon.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Actually, we do have some real estate available if you are interested.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ahhhhh, you see so…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
We offer you a great tax break.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I have, um, zero dollars. Does that work for you at all?
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
A hundred percent. We have 100% tax break as long as you build something immediately.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, build something immediately…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Can you build it over a patch of forest land?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sure we could. Because really what’s the most important thing is that it faces the moon.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Yes. And no more bunnies.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, I should… uh…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Or trees.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
… think not. So why don’t I just reserve this space. I’ll just… uh… here. I’ll just write on this piece of paper “reserved for Moon” and in the bottom corner…
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
When can you start construction?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…I’m just gonna draw a bunny with a line through it.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Perfect.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And, uh, I’ll just say…
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
Wait, Grand Sprawler. Do we not need to do the meeting for the citizens to notify them of the development?
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Yes, we will do it after.
(starts cackling)
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
(cackling)
Oh, I am sorry. I just enjoy that joke so much.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Oh, you scared me for a second.
MARISA (AS URBAN TOADIE)
Yes, I am just being silly. Ho. Continue.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, how about if I just put um… how about this… will they buy this… coming… next… month.
SEAN (AS GRAND SPRAWLER)
Perfect.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Excellent.
SEAN AND MARISA (AS GRAND SPRAWLER AND TOADIE)
(diabolical cackling)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Finally, a civilization I understand.
UNICORNI:
MARIS:
Blat finds himself in quite a beautiful place. There’s an emerald green meadow, there are rainbows in the sky, there are flowers everywhere, and all around him he sees these beautiful white horses. In fact, they’re unicorns with rainbow manes and horns and they are prancing together and frolicking.
MARISA AND MIKE (AS UNICORNS)
(neighing delightedly)
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
Welcome, welcome to the United Church of Unicornia! Oh-ho-ho-ho…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh hello… uh… I didn’t realize that there was a, uh, established religion for hornèd horses. Uh… I was wondering if perhaps I could talk you fine folks into giving up everything you ever knew and, uh, perhaps worshipping the moon.
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
(neighing)
Oh welcome, fellow hornèd one. Welcome to our lovely place. What is this moon you speak of?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, it’s the, uh, big circular thing in the sky that comes out at night.
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
Oh, oh-ho-ho-ho, we are so busy looking at our own reflections in the pond we don’t often look up to the sky.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I see…
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Now, do you happen to have a little girl with you? They are our favourite, they worship us so.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I see…
Uh, no it’s just me, uh…
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
(neighs with disappointment)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A seventy-something demon in a torn bedsheet.
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
Oh well, we accept all comers. Come, come… come to our circle of Fun and Frolic.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, fun and frolic? Well you see I don’t quite have time for either fun or frolic. I have a lot of places I need to get to on this trip. Uh, how would you feel about worshipping a very mean woman named Celene?
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh noooo, nooooo… a mean woman does not sound like what we want at all…
(neighs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But aren’t mean women just little girls who like unicorns all grown up?
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
(gasps)
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
(gasps)
MIKE (AS SPRINKLES)
(gasps)
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
Ohhhhhh… they grow up? This is frightful!
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
I’ve never heard of them growing up, Sister.
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
No, no, this is terrible.
MARISA AND MIKE (AS UNICORNS)
(worried neighs)
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
Is that where they go when they leave us?
MIKE (AS SPRINKLES)
(gasps)
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
I can’t believe it.
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
…why they don’t… come back?
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
No! And then maybe they turn into… what HE is.
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
(gasps)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I’m, I’m not a little girl…
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
You are not?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I’m a…
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
A grown-up little girl?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I’m… that would be a woman and that’s different from what I am… I’m actually a half-demon male… um…
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
Ohhhhh, this is all very unsettling. Oh no…
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
I don’t feel like frolicking, sister!
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
Yes, I know, and that is the worst of all. I think I need to go and cry some unicorn tears.
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
Oh, my horn is drooping!
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
No!
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
My colour… my rainbow!
MIKE (AS SPRINKLES)
(gasps)
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
You must leave here quickly! Quickly, before you dissolve everything that we believe in!
SEAN (AS CUPCAKE)
I’m melting!
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
(weeps unicorn tears)
MIKE (AS SPRINKLES)
Sister Unicorn… I’m disappearing…
A shimmering sound as Sprinkles vanishes.
MARISA (AS SPARKLES)
No! Nooo! Ohhhh-ho-ho-ho.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh… I’ve done a terrible thing.
GLOR:
MICHAE:
Blat walks up to a shack on a beach with a long dock stretching out into the ocean where a large wooden ship rests.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hellooo? A… ahoy?
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
Yaarrrr… a new recruit has joined us on the quest to find the Golden Gates.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
How did I know you were going to talk like that?
Hello, my name is Blat. I am a representative of Celene, Goddess of the Moon.
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
Aye! We will sometimes steer the ship by the light of the moon when we must sneak up to get closer to the treasure.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah yes, well… that would mean that the moon is very important to you, isn’t it?
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
Aye, the moon has been a friend to me and the others on the crew.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Soo… perhaps then the moon would be perhaps the most important thing ever to you?
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
The most important thing ever to me after my rum and my freedom is gold. And that’s why we’re seeking the glory of the Golden Gates.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But you haven’t found the Golden Gate yet, have you?
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
Well, not per se. We found plenty of gold and we found some gates and, well, I found a bit of glory but… no, we haven’t exactly found the Gates of the Golden Glory. No.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, how do you know that the Golden Gate isn’t on the moon?
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
How per se would we get our ship up to the moon?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ahhh… well that very question will be answered by the representatives from your new religion… Celene, Goddess of the Moon!
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
Isn’t that you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Dammit. Uh… yes, that would be me.
At the gaming table, something gets knocked to the floor with a loud clank.
SEA:
(laughing)
Do that again.
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
Yaarrr, I dropped my scabbard down these here stairs.
SEAN (AS PIRATE LIEUTENANT)
I got it, Captain. There you go.
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
T’ank you there, Lieutenant. I’ve got my eye on you. Just next time, be more careful when we’re doing something inappropriate and difficult to edit out.
SEAN (AS PIRATE LIEUTENANT)
I’ve got a firm grip on your scabbard, Captain.
The table dissolves into laughter.
MIKE (AS PIRATE CAPTAIN)
This one’s gone a bit off the rails, savvy?
SEAN (AS PIRATE LIEUTENANT)
Aye, Captain!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So you two seem to have a whole lot going on.
SUN VS MOO:
SEA:
Blat approaches an abandoned building. And there is a door. He looks up from a map that he’s been following and on the door carved into the glass are the words “Enter”.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhhh…
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Ohhhhh…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello?
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Hello!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eh… Hello?
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Hello!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Are… are you the representative of your religion?
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Are you the representative of your reli…
What are you doing here?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… I’m the representative of my religion. I was hoping to speak to the representative of whatever this place might be.
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
No, I’m here for the representative of whoever this might be. I am the Solarites. Who might you be?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I represent Celene, Goddess of the Moon…
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Ohhhh… no you don’t. Excuse me! Excuse me. Whoever’s in there!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, excuse me, whoever’s in there. No, excuse me!
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Hello! The sun has come to pay you a visit!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And the sun always sets. I’m here for the Moon!
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Oh no, the sun burns brightest!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The moon helps you see in the dark! Helloooo! Come on out… whoever this might be.
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
The sun has a lovely smiley face.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The sun will burn you. Come on out… speak to the Moonite. Hellooo?
He knocks again. We cut to the other side of the door.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
I… sir… I think it’s the sun is here. We can’t let it come in. We will burn up.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Yessss, all of these years we protected ourselves from the sun and now it has come to our door.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
What do we doooo?
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Perhaps… perhaps, dear friend, we set the moon, our long friend, against the sun.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Yessss… but we can’t go out there. It is… the sun is there.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
The sun is there.
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Hey you! Lunartic!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hey… well, that’s offensive… what?!
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Hey, hey, what do you have on your list here? I have this as the Teacup Party of Nomentia.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’ve… alright, I’m gonna be honest with you… I’ve lost track. I’ve spoken to sooo many different groups in the last few days. Did you, uh, did you speak to unicorns at all?
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Oh yeah, the unicorns… they loved me.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, I wouldn’t go back there if I were you…
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
So much sun. No, I’m just worried because the only one I can’t run into is the, uh, Vampires Aren’t So Bad Cult because you know, they wouldn’t much care for the sun if you know what I mean. Ha ha ha ha…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I…
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
That would be a real gaffe on my part.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…see… yeah, that would be quite the mistake. Uh, just a moment will you.
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Thank you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Helloooo! Hellooo!
Blat goes back to knocking. We cut back to the vampires inside.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
What do we do?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Does anyone there have any interest in garlic? Helloooo?
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
I don’t know, brother.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
It’s time.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Is it time to rise up?
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
It is.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Then let us riiiiiise.
SEA:
You hear thunder as dark clouds start to spread out from the top of the building.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh…
SEA:
… covering up the sun.
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Oh, it-it’s the vampires… it’s definitely the vampires. Oh, dear.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Vam-vampires?
SEA:
And the door unlocks.
(kachunk)
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Come in.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Come in.
MARISA (AS SOLARITE)
Well, they’re all yours! Nice to meet you. So long, bye-bye, OK, see you later! Off to Brenda’s Kitchen.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, wait, where are you going?
(groans)
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
He’s red—like blood.
SEA:
Cut to: having tea in the parlour.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
You know, I just always feel so misunderstood.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Oh yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Let me tell you, being raised a half demonic even in the far flung future was a bit difficult for me but uh… it gets better.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
More tea?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you. Thank you very much. You know, I had a friend in school who was a vampire and let me tell you in the future time vampires are treated like any other individual.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
That’s good to hear.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
He had to get a special permission slip to get out of gym class outside but other than that he was treated like anyone else.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
But how long do we have to wait for this change?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, here’s the great thing—
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
I feel like I have a tear forming… but I have no ducts brother.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
(gasps)
So poetically tragic.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Ohhhhh…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
From what I understand from you, folks you could live for eternity so you gentlemen might actually make it.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Yes.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Exactly what I needed. Warmth in my heart and a feeling of love.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Wait. Would you like a blood bag?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, a blood bag… great… I’ll uh…
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Oh, is that one of the O‑negative vintage?
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Oh, it is brother, it is.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Oh, you’re in for a treat, friend.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh-hah… thank you very much.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
I bled that one myself.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh…
Ummm…
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
From Harry…
Our brother.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Yes, he was very annoying and into all these different religions.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhh…
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
What can we do for you, brother?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I was hoping I could paint a picture of the moon on your door! Something that would just identify you as vampires.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Well, I think it’s, it’s time. The neighbourhood’s been gentrifying, and it would be nice to add some unique character to our here warehouse.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Yes. Yes, we were talking about hiring an artist. Yes, that would be lovely.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, wonderful. Well, if I could just borrow some, uh, paint. Any colour, doesn’t mind, I’ll get to work on that.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Black.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Of course it would be black. Certainly. Uh, and if anyone asks, I came from my boss, Celene, to do this and you all really, really like Celene.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Is that Celene at the art supply store?
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Oh, she looks delicious.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
She does.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Ahhh…
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
She clipped her nails too short one day and I got a look at a droplet of blood. Right there in public… I could barely contain myself.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
(sighing)
How were you out, Brother?
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Well, it was the midnight sale, of course.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Ho ho… the best day ever.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Of course I…
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Sorry… yes sir… did you need anything else?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, that’s, uh, good. Uh… that was totally the Celene that I was talking about. So uh, I’ll just paint this on your door and be on my way.
Are you sure you gentlemen don’t need the blood bag? I just feel like you guys could use this more than I can.
MIKE (AS VAMPIRE #2)
Well, I’ve been trying to get my midnight beach body ready. I’m off to do cardio.
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
I’ll take the O‑minus.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you. I’ll get to work on your door and, uh, rest assured I won’t be…
SEAN (AS VAMPIRE #1)
Let us know if you need any help… a nip of help.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No… no nips needed! That’s just fine. It’s just a half circle on a door. I think I can handle it.
(groans)
BATTLEFIEL:
Dark mood music with military drums.
SEA:
The sounds of war ring out. Cries. Screams. The marching of many feet, as we crest the trees and see a horrific battle of thousands.
And upon a small hill at one end is a tent. And inside that tent we find Eggerton and Darcy, standing dutifully in front of Moira, who is overlooking a map on a table.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(sighing)
I mean, you, you said I was gonna be a general… and I feel like yeah, I’m up here on the hill but my hat’s not very big.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I never said you were going to be a General, Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’m pretty sure someone said General Eggerton at some point, unless they were saying “general, comma Eggerton”…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Darcy, please make him stop.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(hungover and weak)
Don’t… don’t talk so loudly.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
But I mean I don’t feel that was really explained all that well and…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Please, please keep your voice down Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Fine, I’ll do my very best for you Darcy. But you know, I think this should go as a lesson about how much brandy you should be… I just really think you need to make better decisions.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(talking over Eggerton)
We are here. The main force is over here. Darcy! Pay attention, please.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s so hard with him rambling.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I understand.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I mean, I tried giving you peppermint tea, but you wouldn’t drink it, and you just kinda fell over onto the bed…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
The river here is what I’m worried about.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(humming to himself)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton! Stop it!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Fine, fine, fine.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I need you to take these last three knights… and you’re going to go this way to the river. And you’re gonna make sure our flank is secure. Understood?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, I guess.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Today, the Shattering falls.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
How does the Shattering fall, though? I mean, did you tie its shoelaces together? Or was it like kind of tipsy like Darcy is right now? I don’t really understand figuratively how it would fall…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Eggerton…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
What?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Take a weapon off the rack.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, okay. I kind of like the, uh… the big stick.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Very good.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I got the stick… I’m just gonna take the sharp thing off the end and… I’m probably just gonna cut myself with that if I take it out this way.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
And best of luck to you both.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, thank you so very much. Now I’m gonna head back to the kitchen. Can I get anyone anything?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re in a tent. What kitchen are you going to?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, no… I was gonna sort of skirt around the back end of the battle and, uh, head back to the Academy where my kitchen is…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re a General now, Eggerton…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh so I AM a general?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You need to go and be general-like. Good luck with that.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
OK… I will generalize outside then won’t I?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, take some knights with you.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
All right, I’m gonna take some knights with me and I’m going to generalize and we’re not gonna go back to the kitchen and cook.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Very good.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
And then after dinner, you’re all gonna say “Gee, I could go for some dessert. Eggerton, do you have any pie?” And I’ll say no, I had to go generalize out here with all of these knights.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’ll probably be dead, Eggerton. There won’t be any dessert needed.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
That’s kind of dark.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
If you wouldn’t mind… the river on the west flank is your position.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
My position or Darcy’s position?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, wait, whose position was that?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
‘Cos you told her to go to a flank—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Am I the east or the west flank?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
You are both on the west flank.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Take these knights…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Alright wait… I thought I got the rest of the knights. Like she gets these like three and I get the 500 over there, right, because I’m a general and she’s…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
The three! Hold the west flank with the three!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’ve got the map and I’m holding it. This is the west flank?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
No, that is the east flank. This here by the river is the west flank.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
‘Kay, but there’s two rivers.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Step outside with me, please.
SEA:
And she grabs Eggerton…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oorp!
SEA:
…and sort of yanks him outside. And points.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Over there.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yup.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Those trees.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yup.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
That’s by a river.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Hold to that river.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
What do you want me to hold to it?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
With these knights…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Go there.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
And don’t let the Shattering through.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Give me the map, Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Fine.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Here.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Now please, if you will…. I have a war to run.
SEA:
And she goes back inside the tent.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, she’s a cranky pants.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
She’s a little hoity toity, I’ll admit. Especially since it’s her sister who screwed everything up, apparently.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(from inside)
I can hear you!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… sorry!

You are Morrigu’s voice. Use your power.
CARTER (AS BLAT)

I don’t wanna be a Prophet of Morrigu.
SEAN (AS THE HIGH PRIESTESS)
Slaad. Kill the little one.
SEAN (AS A SLAAD)
Lazbo will fight the little one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The little… who’s the little one?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka!
The bazooka starts to appear, but something’s wrong. The ground rumbles.
SEA:
Lightning races down over all the wood and strikes in at Blat. One of the giant limbs tears off the tree…
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Sanctify this temple again, to the goddess of your choosing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Loxsyn! We choose Loxsyn to be the goddess of—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Are you sure, Blat?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let’s all drink a toast to Blat, who’s never coming back ever. And is just going to be some moon goddess lover boy for the rest of time.
SEA:
Pair after pair of knights in full plate mail march into the room.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
This is our army.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
You said I was gonna be a general… and I feel like yeah, I’m up here on the hill but my hat’s not very big.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What I’m trying to do my good man is to try to talk you out of whatever you folks worship in order to get down with the Goddess of the Moon!

Here’s a moon for you.
Frat boy hooting and hollering.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I used to like my life.
AFTER THE BATTL:
Moody, plodding orchestral music.
SEA:
We open on a riverbank that is trodden and torn and muddy. Bodies lay strewn about. An eerie silence, a lack of any bird song or any other sounds except for the churning and darkened water.
Eggerton and Darcy are standing beside three large knights in full plate mail, visors down. Eggerton is bloodied, limping slightly, and Darcy looks the worse for wear as well. And they are standing there surveying what is left of the battle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that didn’t go too well.
So, uh, knights. Um.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT)
(gruff mechanical voice)
Awaiting orders.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. Orders. And as the general available right now. I will order you to, you know, do knightly things. Uh…
SEAN (AS KNIGHT)
Awaiting orders,
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, I’m getting to it. So we’re going to march henceforth, about face and then um, flank the upper pincher and… fly arrows, that’s a thing…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Didn’t we do what Moira told us to do? We held the riverbank… we’ve done our job. Right?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, well, yeah, technically we did.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So maybe we should just report back to her?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you think it’s safe?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know. Maybe we should send the knights.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What we should do is send one of the knights and keep the other two here, just in case.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey, that’s some good general thinkin’.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right? I have a lot of very positive general thoughts.
Okay, knights! Alpha Blue Trinkle. I am assigning you to return to headquarters and report on the current status of the river bank, which is: all clear, 10–4.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT)
Which of us is Alpha Trinkle?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That is not you, clearly, Ruxpinian.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I… oh. And then the third one’s Beta Red Sprinkle, right?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s right. I don’t know how that can be in any way confusing to anyone.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know how we forgot about that.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Silly knights are all jocks.
(he bangs on one knight’s armour)
So you, you are going to go and provide our reports to Moira. You’re going to ask her if we’re allowed to have a nap. And when the tea will arrive. Then you come back and let us know. Okay? Okay.
Let’s go team. Whooooooa, Eggerton!
SEAN (AS KNIGHT)
Proceeding with orders.
SEA:
And one of them begins to walk away mechanically, towards the sounds of battle in the distance and the hill on which you can sort of through the trees still see Moira’s tent.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You know, I actually thought was going to be a bad idea making you the general, but I kind of like the way you run things.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mmm-hmm. That’s, that’s, you know, the general consensus.
A strange popping sound.
SEA:
There’s a pop sound and Darcy’s head is now a beetle face, and continuing to talk to you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So you think it went well, right? And why… why are you looking at me like that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(a stressed-out whine)
Uhhhh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why are you looking at me like that? I feel like it’s the way you looked at me when I had really black eyes.
Pop.
SEA:
And suddenly, it’s as if for you, Darcy, perspective just changes and he is 500 feet away. But you can still see him.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(shouting)
Egg… Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(not shouting)
Why? Why are you yelling?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Because you’re so… how did you get so far away?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m right here. I have a question though.
SEA:
And a fish walks past.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay…? So there goes salmon. Uh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why don’t you come closer to me? Come back!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m only a few feet away from you. But I noticed that your face—I mean, I don’t want to judge your makeup choices. But I feel like the whole beetle thing is a little weird.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are you talking about?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, your face is like a beetle. Right now…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s nice. I think it’s been a tough battle. You don’t look so great yourself, you know.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We both know I look beautiful. But I think more particularly it’s…
Another pop.
SEA:
Suddenly Eggerton is a plant from the waist down.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, there’s something really bizarre going on here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, yeah—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You have a stem have for legs.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, you know what? I have been doing a lot of cardio lately. And I’m trying to bulk up a little bit. I don’t appreciate that tone—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. I mean, you literally have a stem. It’s like you’re a plant with an Eggerton bloom on top.
Pop.
SEA:
And suddenly the world goes back to normal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Now see, now your face is back to normal.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, something was going on. You seemed far away. Did you see the fish walk by? What’s happening?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I did see the fish. I named him Trevor.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, but that’s not normal. I mean, you naming him Trevor and the he walked by; both of those things are not normal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But I feel like I am pretty consistent.
Pop.
SEA:
And suddenly you have swapped places.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What—?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that, that’s weird.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I was just…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because I was there. And you were here. And now I’m here and you’re there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What is going on?
SEA:
A horn sounds in the distance. And the two knights turn and start to walk away.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh… Guys, where are you going?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we should follow them. I don’t want to be without the knights.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, let’s, uh… Troop? Onward!
MIK:
And we follow the knights.
The music returns, with the uncanny popping sounds.
SEA:
And everything just keeps changing as you’re following the knights. At one point, you’re following two villagers and then seven knights and then half a walking knight.
And it’s like the world is just fizzing in and out of reality, as you will jump suddenly 100 feet forward and then be 100 feet back from where you were as you’re approaching the hill. And you see all the knights from the battlefield. They’re all marching towards the hill on which Moira’s tent resides.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think I’m having the worst hangover of my life.
Theme music plays.

Episode 17: Return of the Oracle.
REBOO:
Marching feet and an unearthly buzzing.
SEA:
As you crest the hill, you see all of the knights marching through what appears to be a gateway of just blackness and you see it is made up of beetles that are head to wings, all just floating in the air. And in between them it’s just a void and as each knight steps through two by two, they flash and disappear.
And you hear the trumpet call again. And Moira’s tent flap is open.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That wasn’t there before.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Definitely not.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you know, giant beetle doorways notwithstanding I feel like it’s been a good day. So why don’t we go check in with Moira…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, run to Moira. Run to Moira now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know if we need to run. I said I was doing cardio but—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(interrupting him)
To the tent, to the tent. Eggerton, quickly. Let’s go, let’s go!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay!
SEA:
So in the tent there are servants running in and out, carrying stuff out of Moira’s tent and through the gateway. And Moira is standing at the table rolling up some parchment.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh… reporting in, Troop 17 Alpha. Sigma.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Eight?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Are you done, Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(Quietly)
Very, very, with berries.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Thank you Eggerton. Darcy. Good. You both made it back. We’re sounding the retreat, as you probably noticed, the storyverse is beginning to collapse. So we will be retreating while it reboots.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um… so there was this thing, where Darcy thought she was far away, but she was really close, and a fish named Trevor walked by. I’ve got some questions—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, Eggerton. I just explained that the storyverse is rebooting. It is now unstable. We’re protected here while we’re near the gate, but we only have so much time. So I’m just going to finish packing up. You two will be remaining and you can finish the mission.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Once the storyverse reboots, which it should do, then you can basically continue the mission like a normal mission. most of the Shattering has been eliminated from this world—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Most?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Well, that’s what we were doing, right? All the Shattering that we were fighting…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We were holding the river.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes. And the giant field just beneath the hill where the big battle was happening…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There was a big battle?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Okay! So, Darcy, you’re going to be holding, staying here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’d like to “holding up” for a minute here. I’m sorry. This is collapsing and you want us to stay? I mean, your big guard, burly people, Beta Trevor Red, are leaving, and we’re stuck here? How can we cope with this? We keep switching places and he’s talking bear, and…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m talking bear?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sometimes!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
“Collapsing” was a strong choice of words for me, it won’t be that bad. It’s just rebooting. So the storyverse has become unstable, it will reboot, and it will try to recreate itself. And then it’ll be like a normal mission where you’re going to try and find any leftover remnants of the Shattering that you can eliminate. Here, you both need to be wearing—I see you’re not wearing—here.
SEA:
She goes into a box that has servants running by with and she pulls out two ICT medallions. And she hands one to each of you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
You both know how to use these.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So this whole rebooting with us still in it thing is a little troublesome to me because I’m doing the math. And it seems that we’re skipping the long division and going straight to the brackets and equations? And from what I remember from my studies, you have to do addition and subtraction first. Then you multiply, then you divide. Then you do brackets and exponents. And it feels like we’re skipping right over—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Leave the calculus to me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
And the two of you are going to be fine. The system will reboot. And you can just go about your life as normal, it’ll be a normal mission, we have taken out most if not all of the Shattering from this world.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But to Eggerton’s point, what is going to happen to us while this storyverse reboots?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
It might be a little disorienting.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Mmhmm…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
But it’s in collapse. So it will reboot very quickly. Worst case, you end up in the void and you just use your medallions to teleport back to the Nexus.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’ve done that before. Although I forget how it works.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Right. I don’t have a lot of time—
Excuse me! Yes, no, that dresser’s going…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You brought a dresser to a battlefield?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I did, Darcy. you can never be too prepared.
Okay, so right here, this is Ccmms. You’ll be able to reach me. This is Transport, you turn it to this and press and it takes care of the rest.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, and then there were sensor detect mode and charge modes.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, that is correct.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, I’m sorry! It’s been a while. See, we were in the void for a bit and it was actually more than a bit. I think it was quite a long time…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Wait. Here, I think I have one here.
SEA:
She pulls out a card from her desk.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, here’s a card that explains all the modes for you Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ooo! Sweet.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I really must go. Good luck to you both. If you have any problems, remember turn it to Talk…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, quick question. Can we talk to Ananka through them this time again? She was quite nice.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(sharply)
No you may not.
Silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, okay.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
If you speak to Ananka, you will tell me at once. Is that clear? She is now an enemy of the Nexus.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That seems kind of extreme, because she always seemed—
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
That is what you will do, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so, Darcy…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Is there a problem with that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
If you hear from Ananka, please let me know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I will, General.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you, Lieutenant.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(to herself)
What was I thinking…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And then I will report in to Moira after I catch up with Ananka. Last time we spoke, we were going to trade some recipes. And she was telling me how to clean up my boots a little bit so they look nicer…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggsy… I don’t think Moira wants us to talk to Ananka at all.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, how are we going to—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
I think they’re having a sisterly fight that we don’t want to get in the middle of.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well you know, I always heard that if you’re having a fight with family, the best thing to do is to sit down and talk it out.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right, but but she’s not your family. So maybe we should just do what Moira says and just leave Ananka to her. Also: less trouble for us, don’t you think? We’re already getting rebooted into some storyverse that’s collapsing. So I feel like we have enough to worry about, don’t you?
A pop and a babble of high-pitched voices.
SEA:
There’s a pop sound and a million, it must be a million dwarf-like gnome creatures in red suits with ties all flood through the tent you’re in, just running around. They just swarm around you and keep on going out the other exit.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think that was a dwome convention.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, but seriously, she had this really interesting banana pleather recipe that I wanted to try and we never quite got to exchange it. So: you hear from Ananka, you let me know; I sit down with Ananka, we talk about how to talk about difficult things with family; then we pass on the information to Moira. We do it calmly and in a public place. So you know, there’s no craziness, and then they sit down together and we’re all happy family again! It’ll work out fine. Don’t worry, I’m a general.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m 100% going to let you know if Ananka contacts me. 100%.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Perfect. I now have some questions about both the gnomes and the knights…
SEA:
And you are standing alone in the tent. And there’s a single dwarf-gnome down on the ground that’s waving at you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, hi.
SEAN (AS DWARF GNOME)
Hi!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What’s your name?
A huge implosion.
SEA:
And the whole world goes blindingly white.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Not again.
RETURN TO THE TEMPL:
SEA:
We cut to a figure walking on a path—a path that he has walked many times. He is dressed in a dark cloak with frills, and a hood that completely covers his face. But the hood is thrown back at this moment. And we see Blat emerging into a glade and in the distance, rising out of the trees, is a giant tree, mostly destroyed.
It is Temple Idries, except now the stump is covered in flowers and greenery, still split down the centre. And giant flocks of white birds lift up and circle around to settle elsewhere.
The path in front of Blat is lined with flowers. And it is green and it weaves in and around what used to be, he presumes, the giant branches that had fallen, except now they are covered in moss and flowers, and wild animals graze all around the glade.
And in the distance, he sees the entrance to what was Temple Idries.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ooooh, it was all worth it! It looks fantastic.
I’ll won’t be able to visit for very long, I need to convince everyone else on this continent that their religion is wrong and they need to follow the Goddess of the Moon.
(sighs)
I can afford to visit for a minute or two.
SEA:
And a few hundred feet ahead, Blat sees two Slaad workers that are tending some flowers.
We’re going to pause for a second as Marisa and Mike pick their Slaad names from the list there…
MIK:
Ooo hoo!
MARIS:
Oh no, I can’t do Slaad. How do I do…?
SEA:
(demonstrates)
Put your tongue on top of your teeth and talk…
MARIS:
(in the thick, lisping Slaad voice)
Like this?
SEA:
You got it.
MIK:
On top of your teeth and not the bottom.
MARIS:
(in her normal voice)
I just want to read the list: It’s Swoth, Goff, Glom, Belarga and Helen.
CARTE:
(laughs)
MIK:
I want to be Helen.
MARIS:
Okay, I’m going to be Swoth.
SEA:
Okay, you’re Helen.
MIK:
I’m Helen.
MARIS:
Uh-oh.
SEA:
So we come back. Blat, on the beautiful flower-strewn path ahead of you, a few hundred feet up, you see two Slaad busily working and talking about the flowers that they’re attending.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello! Slaad!
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Who’s there?
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
Hello.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, do you not recognize me? Sorry, I’m dressed like a vampire. It is I, Blat! I was here a few weeks ago. You know, during the… unfortunateness?
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
Ohhh. Remember the Chosen One?
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Yes, the Chosen One! That was my favourite.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I actually was the Chosen One!
MIKE (AS HELEN)
(gasps)
No! Chosen One, Chosen One, come look at my flower!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That is a very attractive flower. So are these new since the new head of your religion has moved in?
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Yes, these we call “Flower of Loxsyn”.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! They are very attractive.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
I call this the Helen strain.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The Helen strain?
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Helen. That’s my name.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Your name is Helen.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Yes.
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
You two! Why have you stopped tending the flowers?
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
No, Helen stopped, I was always doing it.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
I did, yeah.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
I’m tending the flowers.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
It’s my fault. I’m sorry.
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
It is you! Chosen One!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, the ex-Chosen One.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
It is me, Lazbo!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, good old Lazbo!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Helen, why don’t—it’s such a hard name to say. Helen, why did you not tell us the Chosen One is here?!
MIKE (AS HELEN)
I was showing him the Helen Flower from the Garden of Loxsyn and then he was saying my name was nice.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
The Chosen One has said your name is nice. Then it shall be known… as nice.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
I will rename my children Helen One and Helen Two.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I think that will be needlessly confusing…
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
Helen One and Helen Two it shall be.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right then!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
We shall all name our children Helen from this day forward.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now, that’s really going to be confusing. An entire generation of you Slaad all named Helen?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Come, Chosen One. I will take you to the temple.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve only been here a few seconds and I feel like I’ve destroyed your civilization once again.
All Slaad
(chanting)
Helen, Helen, Helen, Helen!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Wait. That is blasphemy!
Chosen One!
All Slaad
(chanting)
Chosen One, Chosen One, Chosen One!
MIKE (AS HELEN)
(after the others have stopped)
Chosen…! Oh, we’re not doing that anymore.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, sorry, we stopped. It’s just that many times.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Oh sorry. I lost track ’cause I was thinking about all the new Helens that are going to be out there. It makes me happy and a little weepy inside.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
We will talk about this at circle.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Okay, thank you.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Come, Chosen One.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, yes, thank you very much. So, is Loxsyn here?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Loxsyn… is in all of us.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, I understand that we all hold a little bit of Loxsyn in our hearts, but have you physically seen Loxsyn?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Seen the goddess?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
They seem to pop up from time to time.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Nobody ever sees a goddess.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right. Why would anyone see a goddess. How… ridiculous.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(laughs)
It’s crazy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(laughs)
It’s almost like if someone had a job with the goddess…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Ha!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wandering around having to do something you don’t want to do in order to keep your friends safe.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
That’s unbelievable.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yeah, it sounded a little prophetic.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
You like to tell stories, Chosen One. Very fantastical stories.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Tell a story about me.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, we must not dally. You already have all the children named after you. I think you’re being a little um, I don’t know, spoiled.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
Yeah, we should talk about this in circle. A lot.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Okay, I just want to know if we get also name the sandwich that I like a Helen?
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
No.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay, come Chosen One, please, to the temple.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, yes. I’d love to see how things have changed since you got the new goddess!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
And have you met Mother Speckley yet?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, I have not. I just got here and spoke to Helen and your other gardener.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
Swoth! I’m Swoth.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Swoth is right here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, Swoth.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
Swoth, is a very good name.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s it’s an excellent name.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
I am the 61st Swoth of my line.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Look, here: the doorway. We have carved the likeness of you into the door itself.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! That’s actually a very good representation of me. And oh look, there’s a little Eggerton and a little… Darcy.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
And that there on the other side—that is the one who tried to attack one of you. Their name will go down for all eternity as evil.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, you have my full agreement there. I haven’t seen her with so much clothing on in quite some time.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Who, Waffles?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… No, I wasn’t referring to Waffles, but that is a very good representation of Waffles as well.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Thank you. I did the work myself.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh that’s very good. Yes.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Thank you. Thank you. But I must not delay. Come—I will leave you here, you know the way.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, yes. Thank you very much.
Oh, this is the first spot where we met Magnum. Oh, good old Magnum. I hope he made it home all right. Poor stupid mail-delivering kid.
SEA:
So inside the temple as you come in, it is rather different, because now instead of everything just made of wood, flowers grow everywhere.
And you see Slaad moving about wearing robes. And where the dias used to be that was sort of destroyed and pushed back with the stairs going down, you now see it’s sort of been made into an altar out of growing boughs and limbs and all kinds of fruiting trees and there’s birds flitting around.
And you see someone that stands out wearing one of the white robes that you had seen on the dead bodies, and she looks younger, fit; frizzled, light-coloured hair. She turns and sees you and you see a flash in her eyes of blue. And just a very sort of hawkish face and very intense. And her eyes narrow as you are approaching.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hello! It is I, the one that used to be known as the Chosen One, but now your religion’s changed, so now I’m just Blat!
SEA:
And she doesn’t say a thing, but her eyes dance all over your outfit, the smudges on your face, your torn-up what’s left of your sandals.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I’m sorry, please forgive my appearance. I had to borrow this little outfit from one of the many temples I’ve been visiting over the last few weeks. You see…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
So you are not here with the Temple of the Night.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know what that is…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Vampires.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, oh oh oh, I see the Temple of the Night, I visited them and you’ll be pleased to know I tried to convince them to give up on being Temple of the Nighters.
Didn’t go so well. In fact, so far I’ve already succeeded and convincing one temple to change their religion. But that’s only because they worship peat moss. I mean, come on: peat moss. Pretty much anything’s going to be a step up.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
I do believe peat moss is one of the things that is worshiped here. Flowers, nature, peat moss.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
I like peat moss.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s sort of low, though, on the scale of nature.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Thank you, Swoth. How is everything coming outside?
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
It’s going very well.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Oh, I’m sorry. I confused you. You are Helen, are you not?
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
No, I’m Swoth. That’s Helen.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
I’m Helen.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
I’m sorry. I’m getting so close to getting these right. Thank you for your patience, Swoth. And Helen.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
They’ll worry in a couple of generations, everyone’s just going to be named Helen, so it’s going to be a lot easier.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
It’s the era of Helen.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Great, I will keep that in mind. Thank you all very much. If you would all return to your duties, I will take the Prophet from here.
MIKE (AS HELEN)
Okay, let’s go play with the Helens outside.
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
Okay.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
So what brings you back to us, oh Prophet?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I just happened to be in the neighbourhood and I thought I’d stop by for a little visit…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
(over Blat)
Uh huh, yes, right, perfect.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
See, I gave up everything that I ever had to make sure that you folks got ol’ Loxsyn in here to worship, heh heh. So I’ve had to accept a little bit of a career change since then. I’m now completely cut off from everyone that I’ve ever known in a backwards era where I’m now convincing people to join a religion that I don’t believe in so that a woman doesn’t sexually harass me.
Silence.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
I’ve never had anyone just put it all out there like that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I don’t mean to brag, but I don’t think anyone in the history of ever has ever been in this situation before.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Hmm. For many, that would be a ploy, a way to cover up something else.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, I’m not covering up anything. I’m literally moving around this entire continent knocking on doors, asking people to give up their religion, their spiritual way of life, their entire belief system in order to join up with the Goddess of the Moon. Because, well, if I don’t do that, then my oath to Celene has been broken and well… let’s just say I’m worried about a couple of individuals, so I can’t have that happen.
So, here I am. Well, I’ve taken up enough of your time. I gotta dilly daddle there’s a group few hundred miles from here that apparently are really into worshiping puppies?
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I gotta convince them to give all that up and just stare at the big orb in the sky that comes out every night.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Oh, just take treats. They’re very easy to manipulate.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay then! Well…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Before you go…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, yes?
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yes. Do you have any subtexts you operate on… what was your name…?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Blat.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Blat. Prophet Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… not anymore?
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Hmm.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I just sorta hate my life now? Yes, I just sort of trudge on day to day.
Oooh! What’s really interesting is that when I convince everyone on this particular plane of existence to go over to the Goddess of the Moon…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…then I get to use my limbo-jumping abilities to go to a different reality and then convince everyone there to sign up with the Goddess of the Moon. And so on and so on forever until I meet—I don’t know, my future self? Because I come from an era thousands of years of the future.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
I have never had anyone tell me so much truth in one go. It’s almost too easy.
Yes, well, before you go, come with me. I have something to show you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, well, I can’t stay long, the puppy people are waiting.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yes, and I’m sure your coming here had no purpose whatsoever.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I just wanted to visit, you know, to see if everything was working out okay.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yes, because Celene wouldn’t want this temple.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well no, you see that was the deal that I…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yes, yes. Come down these steps here as you talk please.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, okay. Oop! Sorry a bit of a steep step there.
You see, she doesn’t need want this temple but this is the last one that I’m going to give up. I’m going to convince everyone else to change their religion. But I want you folks to keep this one, because this is the decision that I made and everyone in my group was like, “What did you do? You talked back to a goddess!” I thought the goddess was being quite rude to us and I was going to give her a piece of my mind…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Here, put this on.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, okay, very good. Oh, this is quite form-fitting. So, “Blat, you shouldn’t say that to a goddess!” But I said you know what? I’m tired of being treated badly by a goddess—
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
This way.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay. Oh, tight corner.
I don’t want to be treated that way. See, I come from a future time where people treat each other a little bit better and I guess I was just getting a bit egotistical, thinking well, you know, I don’t want this person talking to me this way even though that person wasn’t…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
We’ll just anoint you here…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, very good. Ooo! It tickles on my head.
You know, a goddess shouldn’t talk to me that way. But then again, they are a goddess and I’m just a mere mortal, so… what are we doing exactly?
MIDROL:
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
EL:
Hi, everyone, it’s Eli here with this week’s announcements. Firstly, Podcon 2 was an incredible time. We had such a good time meeting fans and fellow creators. We were moved, we were inspired. We are more excited than ever to bring you more Other Bothers and Alba Salix and Axe & Crown and some new projects too. You can find highlights from our weekend on our Twitter feed as well as Instagram. Find all those at OtherBothers.com.
And another thing that happened was that Sean crawled out of bed at about 6:30 in the morning after a night of partying and crawled down the street to play some D&D with the good people of Dumbgeons and Dragons. We’ve mentioned Dumbgeons and Dragons before: they are a terrific live play podcast. And since the four of them were in town, and so was Sean and Travis from Dark Dice, they all sat down together and played some D&D. If you’ve been missing Snegal, Sean was playing Snegal—a little bit hoarse; as I say: partying. But it was a super good time. And you can find the video for that on our Patreon. I will put a link to it in the show notes, or go to OtherBothers.com and click on the Patreon link.
And that’s about all for now. On with the show!
MIDROLL: YES, AN:
SEA:
Okay, sorry. So let’s do it again.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um, alright.
SEA:
Okay, I’ll pick a different offer. From the top… we’re playing a board game,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Playing a board game.
Aha! I roll the dice and it gives a number and I move this little doohickey around the board.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, and I also do that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I hate board games. It reminds me of that one we always have to play with Eggerton. Do you remember that? You didn’t like that…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, that was a terrible board game.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, that was really bad.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What was the name of that game that I hated so much?
SEA:
Okay, okay. Cut, cut. Okay, guys, it was, you know what—that was great. Let’s just do that again.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s like we were playing a board game!
SEA:
It was, it was very real. I really appreciate it. It’s getting really like… Can we just do the same thing? If you could just mention patreon.com/albasalix. I think it’s really important, right?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s not even part of the board game.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Okay. It’s a book. It’s a book called patreon.com/albasalix. Okay, let’s try it one more time.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, the finest work of literature ever written.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, and I also like to read.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m also reading over your shoulder, just like we always read books together!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, and…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Move over! Can you turn the page?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh… Yes, and…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you listening, Eggerton? Maybe you should listen to what’s happening.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, and I am listening and not talking over my fellow players.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
patreon.com/albasalix ends the way every good story should: with a murder.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, and… um…
SEA:
Perfect! You said it! I’ll take that! Cut! Did we get that on tape, Eli? Is that good?
THE HEART OF THE TEMPL:
SEA:
You step out of the long walkway—the walkway that Darcy spent quite some time in with Waffles in a previous episode—and you step into a room deep in the heart of the tree. And it is a circular room, and in the centre of the room is just a raised marble dais. It is a circle of marble in the centre of the room and there’s a hole way, way up in the tree lighting in some light, and that’s how the chamber is illuminated. And she says:
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Welcome to the centre, the heart of Temple Idries.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This is the finest bathroom I’ve ever seen. Congratulations.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
If you would but step forward.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! All right.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Towards the pool.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh!
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
And all you see is a circular large piece of marble in the centre of the room.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, it has been a while since I’ve given myself a scrub. I’m just wandering around, back and forth, forth and back.
So, certainly! Let’s dip in our tootsies here. Ooo! It’s a little chilly. People of my kind, we don’t do very well with the cold, but… grin and bear it!
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
I must say, your reaction to the stone turning to water is quite impressive. Most people react.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, yeah. They kind of freak out at that sort of thing?
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah, yeah. Months ago, I probably would have as well. Instead… I once rode on a thing so big we could only see its face. And we went from reality to reality and then these futuristic machines started firing at us. So we just left him there. And he’s probably eaten them all by now. Boy, does that keep me up at night! But I try not to think about it.
(nervous laughter)
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Let’s get our feet out of the pool.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okie dokie.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yeah, let’s just um, maybe you might want to kneel down.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, kneel down? All right. Is there a little towel maybe I should dry my feet off with?
Oh, very good. Okay. And I’m kneeling… and I’m kneeling.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Sure, yes.
This…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh huh?
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Is your scrying pool, prophet.
MARIS:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry, my what pool?
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Your scrying pool.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My “scrying pool”.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You know, I really thought I had a good vocabulary, but that’s actually a little bit of a noun I haven’t come across before.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Okay, so what you’re going to do is calm your mind.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh huh…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Take a deep breath…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I see…
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Stop panicking and ranting.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ha ha ha, that’s all I’ve been doing for weeks and weeks. I mean, I have to convince people to stop liking puppies. Puppies! That’s not going to happen!
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
Trust me: treats. Okay, as you stare down at this pool, I want you to clear your mind.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh huh?
SEA:
Okay, here comes a game.
MIK:
Ooooo… I like games.
SEA:
Where’s my piece of paper…
MARISA (AS SWOTH)
Swoth likes games.
SEA:
So we all know what it’s like when you start to meditate or learn how to meditate. Hopefully you’ve had experiences where you’re like, Oh, I’m going to try this meditation thing. And next thing you know, you’re like thinking about whatever.
MARIS:
I’m a seventh level vegan.
SEA:
Right. So things pop in your head. Whatever. They just can be random things from your past, movies you’re missing, things you’re sad about, things you’re angry about, random things, happy things. And that’s going to basically be what we’re going to do. So we’re going to go around the table…
MARIS:
For Blat.
SEA:
For Blat. So what might pop into Blat’s head when he’s trying to meditate? Michael?
MIK:
A toaster with childlike features.
SEA:
(laughs, writing)
“Toaster with childlike features”… Blat?
CARTE:
A coffee table.
SEA:
“Coffee table”…
MARIS:
Does it have to be an object?
SEA:
Nope.
MARIS:
His declaration of love for Darcy.
SEA:
Right. “Declaration of love, Darcy”…
MARIS:
His awkward declaration of love for Darcy.
SEA:
Oh, it’s me. That one file he lost.
Michael?
MIK:
Doing stuff with Snegal.
SEA:
So the moment with Snegal… what was it… the Friend Song. Snegal and the Friend Song.
MIK:
Yes.
SEA:
Carter?
CARTE:
A teddy bear.
SEA:
“Teddy bear”. Marisa?
MARIS:
How he’d really like to be cuddled by Pfillllll-thi-tckkkkt, the big jelly person.
SEA:
“Cuddled by Quartermaster.”
MIK:
Quartermaster.
SEA:
The feel of a perfectly typed piece of paper.
MIK:
Um… The time he tried going on vacation.
CARTE:
The first time he got a shirt that hid his wings.
MARIS:
He really wants to know how it turned out for that pirate he met.
MIK:
(snorts)
SEA:
“That pirate he met”…
MARIS:
That pirate he met and his clumsy… first mate, would it be?
MIK:
Would it be lieutenant?
MARIS:
We’re very nautical here.
SEA:
12… Oh, firing a bazooka at the priestess. You have a twelve-sided, right?
MIK:
Yep.
MARIS:
Ooo! You get to roll a die! It’s so exciting.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
Oooo.
(sings)
I have the power.
MARIS:
(at the same time)
…The power!
MIK:
That was my thing. I don’t know why you took it away from me.
SEA:
So…
MARIS:
Thinking of He-Man.
SEA:
We come back to…
EL:
(off mic)
Okay, start that again?
There was overtalk.
SEA:
So we…
CARTE:
Blah blah blah blah blah…
Laughter.
MARIS:
(simultaneous)
Shhhuuuuut uuuuuuup!
CARTE:
…blah blah blah blah babadoop!
Silence.
SEA:
(takes a deep breath)
So we…
(stops)
Oh, you guys—I thought you were all going to do it again!
The chaos of noises and giggles resumes.
CARTE:
Blah blah blah blah blah…
MARIS:
We’re not that rude!
CARTE:
Ah bop a dee dah doo dah hoy hee hoo ha…
MARIS:
It’s the dwome convention!
MIK:
You need to give us a signal. You need to give us, like, a “be a dick” signal.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
I didn’t think I had to cue that, to be honest.
Laughter.
MARIS:
You don’t have to give it to Mike.
MIK:
Yeah. You’re welcome, by the way.
SEA:
Thank you. So we come back to…
CARTE:
(even louder)
Bah bop a dee dah doo dah…!
SEA:
There we go! All right.
We come back to Blat and he is kneeling in front of what used to be a circular dias made of stone and is now a pool of water slowly rippling in front of him. And the woman beside him has stood up and is slowly stepping away… and she’s speaking softly but quickly.
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
It’s important that you clear your mind…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh huh?
SEAN (AS HAWKISH WOMAN)
And you channel the goddess Loxsyn and then the visions will appear before you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, visions. Okay, but remember I haven’t got too much time here, so I’ve just gotta hurry up and relax!
SEA:
And the first thing that pops into Blat’s head—Michael is rolling a…?
MIK:
8!
SEA:
You are kneeling there, breathing deeply.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(breathes in)
SEA:
And you remember what it feels like to hold that freshly typed perfectly line spaced piece of paper.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhhh! That was the first thing I ever filed at my job nine years ago. Wait, it wasn’t nine years ago! It’s thousands of years the future! That piece of paper doesn’t exist yet—oh I’ve broken my brain.
SEA:
And a darkness comes over the room and you hear the distant sound of thunder and you hear Mother Speckley take a sharp intake of breath like,
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
(inhales)
Blat! What is happening? You must focus. Focus. Calm your mind.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Focus. Calm my mind.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Think good thoughts! It’s as if you’re still connected to Morrigu.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m absolutely still connected to Morrigu.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
You’re what?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m never going to be able to rid of Morrigu!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Okay, quick, calm your mind! You must calm your mind!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
You must choose Loxsyn, not Morrigu!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I want to choose Loxsyn! I don’t know how to choose Loxsyn!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Think calm thoughts!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay! I’ll think calm thoughts!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Sorry, calm thoughts. No pressure.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just the first, random thing that pops into the old noodle. No pressure!
(hyperventilating)
SEA:
You can tell him what he’s doing…
MIK:
I have rolled a 4.
SEA:
You have rolled a 4.
MIK:
I have rolled a 4.
SEA:
The next thought that pops into your head is that one file you lost.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(screaming)
Nooooo! I would have had a perfect record! A perfect record! But then my boss’s boss’s assistant contacted me and asked what about that file and I couldn’t find it! I couldn’t find it at all!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Blat! Deep breaths! Breathe! Prophet!
SEA:
Lightning strikes down out of the sky! The room is dark, almost pitch black.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I had to miss lunch that day… I still couldn’t find it!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Are there any good thought,s good things you can remember?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t remember anything good. I’m just wandering around alone, dressed like an emo vampire!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
A moment… no, that you felt calm, that you felt like life had meaning?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Life had meaning? When my life had meaning, oooohhh…
MIK:
I have rolled a 6.
SEA:
You remember a teddy bear.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(gasps)
The bear I had as a child! My father gave it to me! Oh my father…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
That! Think calm, calm, deep, breathe…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My father.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I love my father.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My father was human…
But he raised me as a human.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Calm… yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My father. He hasn’t even been born yet.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
No, stay with the teddy bear.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My father doesn’t exist.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
The teddy bear?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The teddy bear… hasn’t been made yet.
SEA:
The room is getting darker… and darker…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The teddy bear doesn’t exist… I’m having memories of a thing that hasn’t happened! Oh! Oh!
MIK:
I rolled a 1.
SEA:
The next thing that pops into your head is a toaster with childlike features.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
There must be something, something from your… from this time that doesn’t exist that brings you joy!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Toast! Toast! You can’t get upset about toast.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Toast. What’s it taste like?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s just toast.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
No, but what does it feel like?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s warm bread. Warm bread in my mouth.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And how does it make you feel?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Less hungry. Toast…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Toast, yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Toast… everything’s fine.
SEA:
The light is starting to fill the chamber, you’re starting to hear the sounds of birds outside.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Do you people have toast in this era?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
No, no I’ve never…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What?
(screaming)
There’s no toast? It’s just warm bread! How can you people not have warm bread? Blat’s freaking out again, Blat is freaking out!
MIK:
I rolled a 6.
SEA:
You remember your teddy bear.
Thunder and lightning.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The teddy bear again!
SEA:
Roll again!
MIK:
9!
SEA:
You remember your first attempt at a vacation.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right, right. People kept telling me, Blat you’ve got 36 weeks of vacation time, get out of the office. And I was like No, I can’t leave! I still haven’t found that one file from three years ago. They were like, “We don’t care! You’ve gotta get out.”
SEA:
It’s getting dark…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So I did. I left town… I left town…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes, and?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But I didn’t know what to do with myself, so I just went back home, I applied for my job under a different name, worked it for those weeks, then, abruptly and dramatically quit and then came back the next day as myself.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And how did that make you feel?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I was relaxed I no longer had to go by that other name again because…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes! Stick with that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I didn’t want to be Barbara anymore!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Stick with what that felt like! That calm, relaxed…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in a trance)
I’m not Barbara.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Say it again!
CARTER AND SEAN (AS BLAT AND MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m not Barbara.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
One more time.
CARTER AND SEAN (AS BLAT AND MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m not Barbara…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m Blat.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes, look… the water is clearing. Look! I think I see two figures in it…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Huh?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is one of them Barbara? Because Barbara’s just me in a dress!
MIK:
I rolled a 10.
SEA:
(laughs)
And you are reminded of that time, the first time a shirt hid your wings.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(calming)
Oh! Oh. That the was first shirt I got, and it hid my wings. I could wear a suit just like everybody else.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes. A suit.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Not like Barbara. A suit.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Not like Barbara.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Barbara wore an ill-fitting dress.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
No, stick with you.
CARTER AND SEAN (AS BLAT AND MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m not Barbara… Blat
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Blat wears a suit that hides his wings.
SEA:
And in front of you, the water flashes and fills with a scene. And in it, you see Darcy and Eggerton and they are on a battlefield and they are being rushed and attacked. And then it flashes to these giant knights marching two by two across this muddy field with bodies and you see Darcy and Eggerton trudging along behind them. As all the knights march up and through a dark portal.
You cut to scenes from the Academy of the Fallen: you see Snegal, sad in the kitchen. And you see strange knights in gleaming full plate mail with the visors down, standing everywhere, all around the room.
And you cut to more scenes of Eggerton alone in the room, no Darcy, the room that you all shared. And he’s just rocking back and forth on a cot in the night.
And then the pool clears.
Mother Speckley unclenches her hands from the side of the pool.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
There, that wasn’t so bad, Prophet. Very well done for your first try.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, thank you very much. I saw my friends!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Oh good.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
How are they?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I think they’re doing stuff… right now, there seems to be sadness running from portals, but… well, they’re in our reality, I think? And they’re all still alive. So my grand sacrifice was worth it.
(he stretches)
Ahhh! Well, gotta get on that old dusty road. They’re not going to stop believing in puppies without my help. Thank you for the bath. Thank you for reminding me about everything that happened to me or will happen to me before I come to this backward era. Thank you very much. You’re welcome for the flowers. I gotta be going. Well, so long!
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes. Just leave the robe on the hook…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, oh. I’m sorry. Right. I have to dress like a vampiric idiot.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And remember that while you’re in service to Celene, you will live forever and… you will never stop on this mission.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well. At least I got that going for me… which is horrible.
Can I get sick?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m not sure.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Huh. So I can possibly get sick; my body will weaken; but I won’t die. And still, I’ll be wandering around the multiverse trying to get people to join Celene.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes. Oh, and I placed a small scroll in your…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Vampire pants?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Vampire pants.
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah. Okay.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
It’s from the last prophet. I figure you should carry it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! There’s a last prophet. Well, okay, then. Ah, thank you very much. Glad this is all working out for you. Big raves on the pool. Five stars.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And remember…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hah?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
You can give this temple to whoever you wish.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right. Right. Because I’m apparently important.
No, don’t worry. You guys can… keep what you’re doing with your Helens and your flowers and your sandwiches named after people.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And maybe practice some meditation, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Meditation! Yes, I should do that.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Calm your mind.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Calm the mind. Yeah. Right.
Awkward silence.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m here if you ever need to speak.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Gotcha. Okie dokie, very good. Glad I stopped in.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I think this is one of those awkward goodbyes and never really ends.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just sort of hanging out by the doorway talking about leaving.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Don’t want to be rude.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right… You got you got a lot of stuff going on.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
We’re pretty much in service to you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right! No… Loxsyn. You serve Loxsyn. Just worry about Loxsyn. You shouldn’t say serve me. I’m dressed like an idiot. A very pretentious one and I’m…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
My order serves you, prophet.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Nooo, I’m sure that’s not right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Not this temple.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, no. I made the choice I said this was for Loxsyn. And then people got upset and then my life went into the crapper.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
You can give this temple to whomever you want. My order serves you, Prophet, just as we served the last prophet, and we died to protect him. There were some… friends of mine here wearing robes such as you are now wearing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Just remember, leave the robe here. I don’t…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I’m sorry. Right. On this hook, is this fine?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yep, that’s great.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Okay, I’m just going to put that there…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Make sure you take the vampire pants…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, the vampire pants, I’m sorry.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And the cloak.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The cloak. Yeah, yeah. Big pretentious medallion…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
So, um, after puppies where might you be heading? Just so…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, then I’m probably going to sleep in the forest around that area. Then I go northwest? And there’s a group there that’s really into shelving units. I don’t know…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Oh, the Ikeans!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, thank you. I’m gonna tell them, “Hey, why not just keep all of your books on the floor and maybe worship the moon?”
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Good luck with that. Oh, and don’t forget these treats for the…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, that’s right. For the puppy people.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes. So, Blat, remember um… there’s really no way for you to reach us…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
If I’m not here one of my sisters will be.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Gotcha, right.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Are you sure there’s nothing we can do for you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ah, um… uh…
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Sandwich for the road?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(inhale through his teeth)
Are you folks possibly more powerful than Selene…?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Oh, dear god, no. Not a goddess.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Not at all, no no… ha ha, stupid question. Just thought that I would ask that but… nooo. So that’s a big old nooo…
(silence)
Okay! So off to puppy people I go. All right. Thanks a lot. Talk soon. Love you lots. Buh-bye.

Previously on The End of Time and Other Bothers:
SEA:
Rising out of the trees, is Temple Idries, except now the stump is covered in flowers and greenery.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
So what brings you back to us, oh Prophet?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I need to convince everyone else on this continent that they need to follow the Goddess of the Moon.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
It’s important that you clear your mind…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh huh?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And you channel the goddess Loxsyn and then the visions will appear before you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(screams)
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Focus. Calm your mind.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Focus. Calm my mind.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Think good thoughts! It’s as if you’re still connected to Morrigu.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m absolutely still connected to Morrigu.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
You’re what?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m never going to be able to rid of Morrigu!
SEA:
And in front of you, the water flashes and fills with a scene. You see Darcy and Eggerton and they are on a battlefield.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that didn’t go too well.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We held the riverbank… we’ve done our job.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT)
(gruff mechanical voice)
Awaiting orders.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, I’m getting to it.
SEA:
You see all of the knights marching through what appears to be a gateway of blackness.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
We’re sounding the retreat. As you probably noticed, the storyverse is beginning to collapse.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And we’re stuck here?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
It’ll be a normal mission. We have taken out most if not all of the Shattering from this world.
It might be a little disorienting, but it’s in collapse. So it will reboot very quickly.
A huge implosion.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Not again.
THE STORYVERS:
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy, what if we find the Shattering in this Storyverse? And rather than take it back to Moira, we take it to Celene and trade it for Blat.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait… wait… first of all, I don’t think we find the Shattering; we conquer the Shattering and we find an artifact of the Shattering.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Same thing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, you want to wrangle with Celene?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
No. I‑I-I want to give her a thing so she’ll give us a thing and then no wrangling.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s wrangling. Trust me. We’re gonna be wrangling.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, maybe you do the wrangling. I’ll do the trading.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Now, listen, I will say… I’m a little freaked out by Moira right now. Doesn’t she seem kind of weird and off balance and surrounded by big knight things that I’ve no idea where they came from?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I did notice the big knight things. Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. You named them.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Well, everybody needs a name.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Also, she did leave us alone in this rebooted universe. Ah! The tiger face again. Tiger face. Tiger face.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Oh, uh… ahhhhhh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ah, that’s better.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, good.
SEA:
There’s a flash of light. You guys are floating in a very familiar void of emptiness.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Come on!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
This… this… Uh-hoh.
Alright, let’s start again.
(sings)
Ninety-nine bottles of mead on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of mead… I take it down and drink it alone in the void…
(he breaks down)
I can’t do it again. I can’t. No, I can’t do it again!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why are we here?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We were rebooting weren’t we?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Or maybe this is the reboot.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
Oh no.
SEA:
And there’s another flash as existence comes back around you like a bubble popping up. And your ears are ringing and you’re standing on a road. There’s grass off to the sides. Uh… a few sparse trees and the road leads up to a… basically a hill ahead of you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Phew.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Why didn’t we do that last time?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Because I don’t think we had the option last time. We needed Blat to get us out of there. But don’t tell him I said that.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, we do need to get him back. And I think my plan is the best plan so far because it’s, um, the only plan. So let’s goooo find the Shattering!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Or its artifact.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Or its… you know, semantics don’t help at a time like this. I’m the General. I’m setting the direction and tone of our adventure.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, are we gonna walk up this hill?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well… you walk up the hill and let me know what’s up there. And if it’s worthwhile, I will then come. Otherwise, I will stay here on the flat road.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, you’re leading. You’re the General; you’re going ahead of me up the hill.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Fiiiinnne. Let’s go up the hill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Move.

Episode 18: Going Downhill.
UP THE HIL:
SEA:
As you start to head up this hill on the road, it starts to sort of swing back and forth a little and become a path and the hill’s a little taller than you thought as from further away.
And about halfway up you see what looks like a young woman seated on the side of the road in the grass and she’s picking at some flowers. And she appears to have short blonde hair and wearing a simple floral print tunic and pretty normal pants and sandals from this distance.
And that’s what you see. What do you guys want to do?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Let’s go talk to her.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You go ahead, General.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I will lead the way! Follow in my footsteps and record these happenings for the history books.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. Okay, I’ll follow in your footsteps.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, your feet are bigger than mine though. So…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think that’s unlikely.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you’re like, almost twice as tall as me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey, I like to pride myself on my small feet.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you know my feet are kind of wide. I think they’ve gotten a little wider as I’ve gotten a little older.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Just, just talk to the lady.
SEAN (AS JILL)
(to herself)
…loves me not, loves me, loves me not.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Hello there fellow adventurer! My name is Eggerton, the, uh, fairy and I am a General in, uh, what… what’s the name of our thing? Well, no one…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hi, this is Eggerton and I’m…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I am Eggerton, the General of the Armies of Good Things and Waiting and Patience.
SEA:
She stands up and steps behind a bucket that was down on the ground beside where she was sitting.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I liiiike your bucket.
SEAN (AS JILL)
Um… you like my… you’re a General… like from an army?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I… yeah, sorta… um…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hi, I’m Darcy. What’s your name?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Oh, I’m sorry. My name’s Jill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! And you have a bucket. Isn’t that interesting, Jill? So where’s Jack?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Jacklyn? You know Jacklyn?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh yes, I’ve heard of them.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(whispering)
Who’s Jacklyn? What’s going on?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
You know, that old story? Jacklyn and Jill? They go up the hill?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(whispering)
Why? What’s at the top of the hill?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
Um, I think…
SEAN (AS JILL)
Okay, you guys are freaking me out a little bit. I’m just gonna like step over here. And you guys can just pass…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, sorry. Sorry. We don’t mean to freak you out. Hey, so what are you doing out here? Uh, is everything okay?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Yeah, everything’s fine. Um… you know… just… um… just waiting for my friend. Um… just um… just working.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Are those pleather curds?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Um, yes, yes… I was having some… some… pleather curds.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
And do you have whey to go with it?
SEAN (AS JILL)
No, I just have pleather curds.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s too bad. I heard those two things go great together.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, that’s wrong. That’s not the right one.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
That’s what?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey, is your friend okay? What happened to your friend?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Why do you think something happened to her friend?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Yeah, what happened to… what happened to Jacklyn?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Did you do something to Jacklyn?!
SEAN (AS JILL)
Oh my god!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, no, we gotta go find Jacklyn. What did Darcy do?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay… calm down. Shhhh…
SEAN (AS JILL)
I told Jacklyn to meet me here!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh no, oh no. Oh geez.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s okay. Calm down you two. Calm down General. Calm down.
(over Eggerton’s inhales and exhales)
Take it down. You just said you were waiting. Where are they?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Jacklyn has travelled from a long way so I’m just waiting here until Jacklyn gets here but I‑I’m not sure why I’m telling you all this and I don’t really know you two. And, um, you look… well, you look nice…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why thank you.
SEAN (AS JILL)
Yeah, uh, but if you’re… if you’re travelling to Wayward it’s just over… if you keep going over the hill you’ll… you’ll reach… Wayward.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well uh, maybe we should go to Wayward; is that your capital city here?
SEAN (AS JILL)
(laughing)
Capital? No, no, it’s just my village. I’m heading there after I get some water and well, I thought I might see Jacklyn but…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is Jacklyn coming from Wayward or going to Wayward?
SEAN (AS JILL)
No. Jacklyn’s coming from Farther which is the way you came from?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
We came from Farther?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Well, it’s the next village on that road you were… you were walking on.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Feels like your map designers kind of took the easy road on that one. So tell us about Wayward!
SEAN (AS JILL)
You guys aren’t from here are you?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Welllll, I’m from this place that you may or may not have heard of…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, we’re not. We’re… we’re visiting.
SEAN (AS JILL)
Oh, okay.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
SEAN (AS JILL)
Um, well, um… I just… um… I was just going to head up and get some water at the well and you’re welcome to travel with me up the hill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sure! We’ll go up the hill with you to get some water.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, we will get water up the hill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Mm-hmm.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
From where water originates.
SEAN (AS JILL)
It-It’s just water.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. Just water.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I know. Okay. Uh, yeah, we’ll follow you up there. Let’s go.
SEAN (AS JILL)
Okay.
SEA:
So she starts walking up the road with you two just sort of humming to herself and kicking at the pebbles in the road and every once in a while you see her turn and look back the way you guys came from just checking the road.
MARIS:
So I take Eggerton aside, we walk a little behind Jill, and I say…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, if Jacklyn was where we were, do you not remember there was a huge battle where we were?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, but then everything got reset.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah but do you think Jacklyn would get reset? What if they were hurt?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, we got reset sort of… I think.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I know but nothing happened to us in the battle. Remember, we got through it.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. But that’s only because of my bravery.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, yes. Definitely your bravery and the three huge knight things that were there to crush everything in their path; that might have had something to do with it too.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I was very good at Generaling them.
SEA:
And you both almost walk into Jill who has stopped moving.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, hi. Hi!
(giggles nervously)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sorry, sorry about that.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Hi Jill. How’s things? Long time, no see.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, are you OK… Jill?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Hi Jill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Jill?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Hey Jill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello?
SEA:
Jill’s head turns almost not as a part of her body. And you see dark, black eyes.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Shattering!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shattering!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Found it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shattering! I’m stepping back. I’m moving away from Jill.
SEA:
And her body then follows when her head hits the limit of its movement. Her body then follows until…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
The Shattering’s not very good at humanoid physiology.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, I don’t think that’s what’s important right now. We’re in trouble.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
We’re… we’re not in trouble. It’s just the Shattering. What’s the worst that could happen?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Jill? Jill? Are you still in there?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Jill?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
No, there is no Jill in here. Oh wait, ha… there is.
(contemptuously)
Crying little thing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Listen, you… you let that poor girl alone. You hear me? You… you release her.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
(grunts)
Says who?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Says Darcy.
SEA:
And Jill takes a quick step forward.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gulps)
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Darcy! We’ve met before haven’t we?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, yes, we have.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
(sighs)
SEA:
And Jill steps back a little and turns to face back the way you came.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
And now you bring war.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I‑I don’t know that we brought it.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
No, we… we were there but kind of the war had already started when we got there. So really at most you could say we follow war but we definitely don’t bring war. I wouldn’t say I’m a war bringer or monger, maybe a war follower. Or a war seconder.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Alright.
(sharply)
Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We are here to make sure that people like you aren’t taking over. That’s… that’s why we’re here.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, we… we are gonna set the record straight.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(under her breath)
I really wish we had Blat’s bazooka right now.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
I see. So to stop me, you’re going to march on entire worlds and massacre everyone in them.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(tentatively)
That wasn’t my plan.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
What do you mean by massacre?
SEA:
Jill’s body slowly turns and her head angles down so she’s gazing at Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
That’s unsettling.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
“Massacre” is to destroy everything living in this Storyverse, this world… until it resets.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
What would that achieve?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
(laughing)
It’s your plan.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, as I said, it’s not really OUR plan. We’re… we’re cogs I’d say..I mean… I’m a General cog… I’m… I’m the bigger cog.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Oh, a General?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. Umm… but you know, not that important of a General now that you’re asking… more of like a second tier General, like I do craft services for the soldiers. That’s my division. Uh… we held a river but there was just a walking fish named Trevor. Umm… and I tried telling the soldiers to go and do things, but they kept saying “Oh well give us orders, give us orders!” and I tried giving them orders but they always…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We didn’t massacre anyone!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We fought against the Shattering; we fought evil. That’s… that’s what we did.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, that too.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Oh, I’m evil am I?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I feel like the whole twisty head black eye thing kind of… is a go-to evil move. I mean, if you showed up with peanut butter sandwiches and high fives we probably wouldn’t think you’re evil. Why are you looking at me like that?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
War makes strange bedfellows doesn’t it?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah well, I have had to sleep with Eggerton the past few nights in the tent.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I thought… ummm… we weren’t going to talk…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, you know, it’s a bit stinky in there I have to admit.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I know. I mean, someone’s got to…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Too much craft services Eggerton. Too much craft services.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t help it! My body produces extra gas when I eat field rations but Moira wouldn’t let me bring a kitchen or a campfire.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, okay, maybe this is not the place for this.
(to the Shattering)
Listen, when you possess other people’s bodies, that is generally the indication of someone evil because… I’m sure Jill doesn’t want you in there. Huh? Huh? She doesn’t want to have those black eyes and the twisty head going on.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
You’re right. She doesn’t. I’m fighting for my very existence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, what am…
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
I am not the one trying to eliminate an entire species from existence.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Which species would that be?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Me.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I thought you were like an individual.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
No.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I feel that we may not have been given proper lessons on the Shattering so here’s… okay Darcy, why don’t you tell the Shattering three things that you know about the Shattering?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um, I know that you’re evil… we’ve definitely been told that.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Mm-hmm… that’s one. Yup, definitely.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And your name, “The Shattering”… that in its essence means you’re splitting universes apart and destroying things.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yup, yup, yup.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You know, when you shatter a teacup it’s not very useful anymore am I right?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Exactly. Yeah, and who wants to shatter a teacup? Nobody. Everyone likes tea cups.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I do like tea cups and tea.
(getting back to the matter at hand)
And third! That black eye thing is very disturbing. Nobody likes that.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Again, if you showed up with golden eyes and high fives we wouldn’t think you’re evil but…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rainbows and unicorns…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Rainbow…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Read the room.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Read the field, read what’s going on here.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
I hear these notes. And I will take these notes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Alright, that’s reasonable. That’s surprisingly…
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
But a world without breakage, a world without entropy cannot exist. A world without death, a world without any change. THAT is my role in this world. All worlds. Energy must go somewhere.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Aren’t… aren’t you trying to end time? Like all of it? Because that… that feels like more than a couple of tea cups.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Noooo.
SEA:
And Jill starts to advance on you Eggerton.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Ohhh… really?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Um… noo… Safe space here. Let’s follow the rules.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This feels evil… this is feeling evil!
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Youuu. She has you believing I ended time?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you… you are the Shattering and time ended aaand that kind of feels like the thing the Shattering would dooo…
SEA:
Jill’s face gets very close to yours…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’m uncomfortable with this…
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
(hisses)
Whyyy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey, Creepy Jill, Creepy Jill… over here.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah look… look at her, she’s big and tough. Look at her.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Ask Moira who created and detonated the bomb, why don’t you.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
There was a bomb?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Oh yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Creepy Jill.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Yes Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Does the name Ananka mean anything to you?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
No.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
Wow. I thought that maybe Ananka did the bomb, you know Eggerton ‘cos Moira said Ananka did something… right?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Tell you what, seeing as you have massacred—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t like that word.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
—all of my people here, I will give you this world.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
That’s nice of you.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Yesss. I will take but one small artifact from it.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Actually, we need that artifact to get our friend back.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Which artifact do you need?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
The one that we’re gonna find here… because we’re real good artifact finders.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Well, why don’t you name the artifact you want?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Uhhh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That one that you want. That’s the one we want.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah… that’s… ha… funny how that works out sometimes… so if you could just let us know where you put that object and maybe describe it because we have…
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
You can have the bucket.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, it’s… it’s the bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
It’s the bucket.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I thought it was a nice bucket…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s right here. That’s easy.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Alright. So okay, we’ll take the bucket and… ummm…
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Perfect. And I’ll take this.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
What’s this?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What’s that?
SEA:
And the black eyes disappear. And you see Jill sort of shaking her head like…
SEAN (AS JILL)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened? What have you done to me?!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Uhhh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Nothing.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
We didn’t do anything but an evil presence did take over your mind for a minute.
SEA:
She starts to grasp at the air around her.
SEAN (AS JILL)
What’s happening?! What’s happening?! What?! Make it stop! MAKE IT STOP!
(screams)
SEA:
She just disappears.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Holy crackers!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It took Jill!
(weakly)
But we do have the bucket.
THE SWAM:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So your religion is working for you? Excellent. Sooo…
SEAN (AS SWAMP PERSON #1)
(unintelligible noises)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh yes, I see. It all does seem to be working out for you. Uh… you don’t like…
SEAN (AS SWAMP PERSON #1)
(more unintelligible noises)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right, excellent point. It is a lovely temple that you have.
SEAN (AS SWAMP PERSON #1)
(happy garbling)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Th-the moon? That’s of no interest?
SEAN (AS SWAMP PERSON #1)
(angry grunts)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Nooo… right. Yes, of course. Uh, no moon there. So… uh…
SEAN (AS SWAMP PERSON #1)
(smacking of lips and low rumbling)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, no, that’s really fine. I can’t stay to eat.
SEAN (AS SWAMP PERSON #1)
(deep, sinister laughter)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…or be eaten. Or… whatever you’re asking.
MICHAEL (AS SWAMP PERSON #2)
(strange hooting noises)
SEAN (AS SWAMP PERSON #1)
(more sinister laughter)
MARISA, MIKE AND SEAN (AS SWAMP PEOPLE)
(laughing and hooting and slobbering)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
OK, well I’m gonna leave you folks alone. OK… alright. Good luck with everything. Buh-bye.
MARISA (AS SWAMP PERSON #3)
Bah-bye.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So let’s see, that is… 54 nos, one yes… no peat moss. Lord, I am bad at this. But I…
A rustling of paper.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh wait. Of course. I forgot all about this special letter that was in my vampire pants. Let’s see… ahem.
“Prophecy of the Fallen as spouted by the Oracle of Idris.”
Oh, this is quite interesting.
“The Ancient One stirs beneath the land / for Morrigu has given to him her hand…”
Ohhh.
“To rule the kingdom that shall never be / Against them stands but the Three.”
That sounds like it might be important. Um.
“One must rise to beguile the gods / the Beast within will soon be seen / Another brings the great tree down / as death claims the final clown.”
Well, that’s a bit oddly written.
Ahem. The last stanza.
“When the Three stand on fields bled blue / And heaven splits the sky in two / One shall rise to claim his throne… / And the earth shall be overthrown”?!
He crumples up the paper.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Get rid of that… my heavens… “earth shall be overthrown”? Well I’ve no interest in overthrowing the earth.
Wait a second. If I still have Morrigu inside me and I could use that to possibly fight against Celene? And then… I wouldn’t have to do this anymore? Let’s see… what’s uh… what’s up next?
(consults his map)
Let’s see… in about a day and a half of walking I’m going to come across a church where they worship facial tissues. Oh, I can’t do this anymore! It’s the stupidest thing. That’s it.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, excuse me, young man.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hi. Y‑yes? Hello.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, would you mind opening the door to my hut here? I’ve just got all these groceries.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh… uh… your hut? Do you live here by this temple here?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, yes. The Swamp people. Yes. They’re quite lovely. A little stinky.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I… you just don’t appear to be a swamp person.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh no, I’ve been around… been around… if you just wouldn’t mind opening the door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh well, alright. Uh, here you are. Your door is open.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, thank you so kindly. Oh, please just, um, come on in. Come in. Close the door behind you. I’ll just set these down over here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um, alright. Okay.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
(straining)
I’ll take the lid off my cauldron and… uh… are you good at cutting carrots? Here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, well, I’m not bad I suppose. I’ll cut some carrots for you.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
What’s a young man like you doing in the swamps?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I have a job you see where I have to try to convince people to give up their religious way of life.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
(laughing loudly)
HA! That’s a horrible job.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yeah, it’s quite terrible. And the funny thing is, I’m quite bad at it.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I can’t convince anybody.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Huh… it doesn’t sound easy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I’m enslaved you see by a Goddess. Uh, Celene the Goddess of the Moon.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, yes… Celene… yeah… yeah… difficult… difficult goddess. Difficult energy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So how much carrots do you want in here anyway?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, that’s good, that’s good. Here. Work on the onions.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Onions! Very good. You don’t want it to be too carrot heavy. Alright. Onions. So, uh… do you worship the same God as the Swamp people? Wh-who do the Swamp people worship?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, no, I don’t worship the Swamp people’s gods. I’m just an old woman. I work in the… the Old Arts.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The Old Arts!
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I see. Old Arts.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Now, if you’ll just climb into the cauldron.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Climb into the cauldron?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes, just get in there… it’s nice and warm.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It is quite warm in here!
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes, it is.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Do I distribute the onions around evenly?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes… just put them in with you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Excellent, excellent.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, that’s good.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now when you say that you worship the old arts…
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…I notice that you’re preparing food with a cauldron. Now I’m sorry if this is an outdated term and I don’t mean…
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, just let me shift you a little there.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh alright.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Gotta stir it. Don’t want it to stick.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’ll just use my leg here.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh good.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
If I swish it around that’ll stir.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, perfect.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now I‑I don’t mean to use an outdated term that may offend but the old arts… would that make you some sort of a… witch?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, we don’t use that term anymore.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I’m terribly sorry.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
No, it’s OK. It’s OK.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I knew I was being offensive… I’m sorry.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
I’m a Mistress of the Dark Arts.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Mistress of the Dark Arts! Well, that sounds very foreboding.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes, indeed. So that’s it for vegetables? Just carrots and onions?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, you know I don’t want to set off my stomach.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhh, very good. I see. So it just seems like it’s lacking a main ingredient.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
No, you just keep sitting in there… everything will be fine.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Alright.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes. Here, you can stir yourself. Here… hold this.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… oh… oh… the spoon. Well… alright. I’ll use that instead of my leg. I was getting tired of kicking. Ahhhh, Mistress of the Old Arts. So what do you get up to with all this Mistressing and “old arting”?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, I just… I just sniff it out.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sniff it out?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
A keen old nose still to this day.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Hmmm.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Find the next one.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The next one? Yes. Yes. Oh, wait a second… you don’t believe that it’s your life’s mission to find some sort of Chosen One is it?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, no, no. Nothing but that. Nothing like that!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, thank goodness. I had a group that swore up and down that I was the Chosen One of their religion and, uh, that didn’t work out very well at all. Now look where I am.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
I’m just going to sniff you a little. Hold on (takes a deep inhale)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Thank you. I do smell quite good. I was able to take a bath a few days ago.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
I’m just going to anoint your eyebrows with this stock ointment here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh,well. I‑that’s getting a little personal. I…
SEAN (AS CRONE)
That looks good, yes. A little on your nose.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh..uh… ewww. Um… well, this looks like it’s about done and, uh, I am getting quite wet. I wasn’t a big fan of this outfit but I do appear to be soiling it and it’s the oldest one I have.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, yes. Let’s take that off! Here, I’ll take it from you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh!
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Stay in there. No, no, just pull it off.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, alright.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
That’s much better.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It-it’s a vampire outfit.
(whispering)
Don’t worry. I’m not really a vampire.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, I know a vampire at a thousand paces.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh!
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Horrible, stinky fellows.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, yes… it’s terrible, the vampires. It’s so depressing.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Living forever. Their breath! They really should do something about that.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Oh Lord in Heaven yes. A blood based diet’s just gonna give you the terrible, stinky breath.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Speaking of blood…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
We’re gonna need a little of yours.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Excuse me?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Dark One.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sorry?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
We’re just gonna need a little of your blood.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I‑I’m sorry. One more time. You’re gonna need a little of my…
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes! There, we’re done. That was fast, wasn’t it?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ow-Ow!
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes, here we go. Just collect it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
OW!
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yesss… oh… good, good.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Look, I‑I don’t mean to question your diet but are… are you putting my blood into your cauldron stew?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Oh, it’s not a stew.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, it’s got carrots and onions in it.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
This is a raising.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A rais…? Ah Lord. I think I have a good vocabulary and everyone just keeps using these terms that I’m not familiar with. A raising?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
I believe… outside… you were about to make a proclamation. Now would be a good time to continue… that proclamation.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh… right! Very good. Well, it’s… it’s a long story. But it seems I have an old, dark character living within me.
SEAN (AS CRONE)
(excitedly)
Yes! Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
By the name of, uh…
SEAN (AS CRONE)
Yes! Say her name!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, what… what was that?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
(rapturously)
YESSSS!!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The name was… Morri…
SEAN (AS CRONE)
YES!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…Morri…
SEAN (AS CRONE)
(orgasmically)
OH-HAAAA!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
…gu?
SEAN (AS CRONE)
AHHH!!! HA HA HA-AAAAHHH!!!
(starts to cackle uncontrollably)
YES! YES!!
(more diabolical cackling)
Oh, that hurts.
MIDROL:
EL:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey, everyone, Sean here, and I got a few really cool, super awesome announcements. And then I promise to get you back to find out what Blat is doing ‘cos at this point, I don’t even know what he’s doing. Okay, first off, I was supposed to announce this a number of weeks ago. We have created a new Facebook group on Facebook. That’s where Facebook groups normally are. And it’s called the Reckless Play Guild. And it’s really cool because it’s really active. And it’s not just The End of Time and Other Bothers. Four different live plays have come together. So we’ve got The Lucky Die. We’ve got Dark Dice, we have Dumbgeons and Dragons and us all there and we’re doing some super fun things there. So give it a search: The Reckless Play Guild; we’ll put a link to it in the show notes. Click the link to join. We’ll get you approved in there right away.
Speaking of Dumbgeons and Dragons, they just released a new episode. And it’s sort of special because I’m in it, as is Travis from The White Vault and Liberty and all those shows. So it was a super fun time. We were at PodCon, I got up at 6 a.m. in the morning and trudged down to Pike Place and met up with Russ and the gang. And I have to say I love Dumbgeons and Dragons. They are such an amazing crew and cast and just all around great people and the show is super fun. And I got to play Snegal, who I believe now is a level 14 sorcerer not sure if that’s canon yet, but check it out. We’ll put a link in the show notes. It’s called: the episode is PodCon Two bonus episode one: “When Portals Collide and Birds Fight Back”. So that was super fun. Please give it a listen. Follow them. I love them so much. And it was again just an honour to be there.
Last thing before I get you back, we’re gonna be at Podfast. Podfast? We’re gonna be podfasting for the month of March! We’re gonna be at Podfast Expo… Podfest Expo… I’ll get it right at some point… March 7th to 9th. It’s in Orlando; you really don’t need to know what it’s called… you just need to know it’s in Orlando, March 7th through March 9th. I’m gonna be there. It’s, I think, our first year having a full audio fiction track; we’re gonna have representatives from Mars Fall, from the White Vault, from Girl in Space, a whole lot of other shows. So come on down. Say hi if you’re in the area. I will try and bring a few special things down so if you do spot me Say hi, I’ll hit you up with something and that’s about it. Without further ado, let’s get you back and let’s all find out what in bejeezus Blat is up to.
MIDROLL: ORIENTATIO:
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Okay, um, welcome everyone to Orientation. I’m just gonna close the doors, sit down. Oh look at you wonderful three new knights for our regiment.
MIKE (AS KNIGHT #1)

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Uh, please… please hold questions. Uh, I will ask questions. Okay, so here’s Slide One. “Welcome to the Nexus.” Uh, so… ah…
CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)
Nexus does not compute.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Oh, oh right… um… oh I don’t think you’ve gotten your programming yet. Right. Uh, so the Nexus is just where you live and we’re gonna fight the Shattering.
MIKE (AS KNIGHT #1)
SHAT-TE-RINGGGGGG.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes, uh, so let’s go to Slide Two. This is about brains of people who work here are not to be eaten.
MIKE (AS KNIGHT #1)
Eat brainnnnns.
CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)
Always eat brains?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
No.
CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)
Sometimes eat brains.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
No, no, no, no. Oh no. There are certain brains…
CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)
Often eat brains?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
No. There are certain brains we don’t eat.
CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)
Eat some brains, not all brains.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes. Yes! Oooh, I think you might be a lieutenant-in-training.
CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)
Eat his brain?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Mmm… yeah sure.
CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)

SEAN (AS MOIRA)
No. Not that… no. We need your brain… what’s left of it.
MIKE (AS KNIGHT #1)

SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Yes. Okay, so let’s go to the final slide…
MARISA (AS KNIGHT #3)

CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)
Ten dollars monthly gets you brain.
MIKE (AS KNIGHT #1)
Can we say that legally?
CARTER (AS KNIGHT #2)
Void where prohibited.
UP THE HIL:
SEA:
And we cut back… to standing on a road, leading up on a hill to a somewhat confused looking small, flightless fairy and a human looking Darcy.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
So what you’re saying is that the bucket was the artifact and, um, the Shattering took Jill?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think that’s what happened. I mean, I think it’s offensive for a human being to be considered an artifact but somehow that’s what the Shattering seemed to do and just take her like she was some kind of object.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
What do you think the Shattering meant with all that stuff about Moira and lying and not, you know, being the one responsible for the end of time ‘cos it feels like… that’s in contradiction to most of what we’ve been told.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I have to tell you, it makes me a little worried.
SEA:
You hear a whistling coming from the direction you came from. So, heading towards the clearing in the hill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
Oh no, it’s Jacklyn.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe, it’s just some other person going up a hill…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
To fetch a pail of water?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, or curds and whey… you know… whatever they’re in the mood for.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh brother, read your story books. Alright come on… let’s… let’s meet whoever this is.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, let’s go. Wait! Don’t forget the bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, yeah… you hold… no, wait I’ll hold on to it. Alright, let’s go.
SEA:
You see a figure approaching wearing a simple cloak, a brown wool tunic and pants and heavy boots. You catch a round and happy face as someone is whistling with flashing green eyes as they get closer and carrying a bucket and sort of swinging it merrily and heading towards you both.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Do you think that’s Jacklyn?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. One hundred percent. One hundred percent Jacklyn.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
OK… you go break the news to her.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’ll wait here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
And watch our six.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What? I’m supposed to break the news that “hey, your best friend Jill just disappeared and was taken by the Lord of Darkness.”
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t think they’re best friends Darcy but that’s okay. Uh, maybe we can, uh, you know, redefine the strategy after you tell her and I’ll just hang out here with the bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello! Uh, excuse me.
SEA:
The figure is spinning around like attacking someone with their bucket and then pauses and goes…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Hey, hello.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um, hey, are you by any chance Jacklyn?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Uh, yeah, that’s me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, well. Very nice to meet you. My name is Darcy.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Hey Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We have matching buckets. Ha ha. Isn’t that… cute?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I know that bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, do you?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Wh-why do you have Jill’s bucket?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh-oh, this was a bad introduction. Um, so we… um… Eggerton! Eggerton, you wanna come here for a minute?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Hi, I’m Eggerton.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is Eggerton. Isn’t he cute; he’s a fairy.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
You haven’t answered my question. Wh-where’s Jill?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Why do you have Jill’s bucket?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, you didn’t… tell Jacklyn yet?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Not yet.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Tell me what?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, so I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Which would you prefer to hear first?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I want you to show me Jill. Right now.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, we’ll start with the good news. This bucket is in magnificent condition. It may have a little bit of the Shattering on it.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Aaaaahhhhhh!
SEA:
Jacklyn swings their bucket at Eggerton, charging at your head. What do you do?
MICHAE:
I… duck.
SEA:
Okay… roll Defy Danger, Dex.
MICHAE:
Defy danger, Dex… that’s an 8 with a zero bonus for an 8.
SEA:
And that is a partial success; read to me what happens on a Defy Danger, partial success.
MICHAE:
“On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate or flinch. The GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain or ugly choice.”
SEA:
So would you like to go tumbling down the hill and break your crown?
MICHAE:
(gasps)
SEA:
Or… would you like to be hit by the bucket?
MICHAE:
Well, I don’t have a crown so I’m gonna go with the bucket I think.
SEA:
Okay, you’re getting hit by the bucket? Okay, so you take… uh… can you roll for me a 1d4?
MICHAE:
4!
SEA:
You take 4 hit points damage. So Jacklyn swings through, clocks Eggerton solid and sends him sprawling backwards into the road…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
AAAAAAHHHH!!
SEA:
…and spins and looks at you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, wait, we didn’t hurt Jill! We didn’t hurt Jill! Please, wait, wait… I can tell you what happened. I can tell you what happened to Jill.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, so, so we met Jill.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…coming up the hill…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…to fetch a pail of water… anyway, that’s not the important part! The important part is that when we got to the top of the hill, Jill was possessed an… and her eyes went dark and this evil presence was talking to us and… and then they told us to take the bucket and then Jill just disappeared. It’s the truth. I swear.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
That’s insane!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, it’s happened to us before.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
But where’s Jill?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know. She’s just gone.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Why do you have her bucket?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, uh, it was just left on the hilltop; I‑I thought I should take it.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
That’s so crazy. I‑I don’t know why but I believe you. I need to find Jill. I need to find Jill. I’m sorry… no, I’m not sorry I hit your friend. I need to find Jill.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Owwwwww.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK.
MARIS:
I go over to help Eggerton up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Can you… can you stand Eggerton?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I want her bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You want…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
…Jill’s bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um, um…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that’s kind of our bucket now.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
AHHHHHHHHHH!
SEA:
What do you do? Charging, swinging the bucket.
MICHAE:
Um, I… scream.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
AHHHHHHHHHH-HA-HA!
SEA:
You take a bucket to the head. Roll d4.
MICHAE:
Three.
SEA:
You take another hit point. So, Eggerton goes flying backwards; you hear a resounding… and Eggerton goes flying backwards…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Ahhhhhh!
SEA:
…into the grass.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Wait, stop. What… can I ask you…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I know how to use this bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I know. Clearly you do. Uh, can I ask you a question?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
(gritted teeth)
After you give me Jill’s bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why do you need Jill’s bucket?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
(angrily)
‘Cos it’s Jill’s bucket!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Okay, I have something to tell you. And I’m sorry if this is gonna sound really weird. But… but this bucket is really important to us and… and… let me tell you why.
(in a strangled voice)
We’re trying to stop the end of the world.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
GAHHHHHHHH!
SEA:
What do you do?
MARIS:
I duck.
SEA:
OK… roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
And what do I do? Dex?
SEA:
2d… yeah… +Dex. So…
MARISA & SEA:
2d6.
MARIS:
(referring to sheet)
It’s so long… I have to find my Dex.
SEA:
Or +Strength. Whichever’s better. Your main sheet.
MARIS:
Oh, yeah. My Dex is better. Alright…
SEA:
+1.
MARIS:
I roll a… ohhhh… a 3+1 is a 4.
SEA:
Roll d4! Roll d4.
MARIS:
It’s a 1.
SEA:
So you take one… so it basically glances off of your shoulder… ummm… but Jacklyn is not… does not look happy and is looking like they’re gonna swing again.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, Darcy, I’m coming to rescue you. Ready? Bazooka!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no, that’s not gonna work, Eggerton!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh yeah, that wasn’t me…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, wait!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Wait… no… wait… what?
MARIS:
So I cast Hold Person.
SEA:
Okay.
MARIS:
Which is a… so how do we cast spells again? Uh, roll Wis.
MICHAE:
Tee-hee-hee!
SEA:
So roll 2d6 plus your wisdom to cast a spell.
MARIS:
It’s a 7… +2 is a 9. So on a 10+, the spell is successfully cast. On a 7–9 the spell is cast but choose one: I draw unwelcome attention or put myself in a spot; your casting distances you from your deity, take ‑1 ongoing to Cast A Spell. And after it is cast, the spell is revoked by your deity. So I think… oh… unless…
SEA:
You can keep the spell if you take one of the other things: draw unwelcome attention or take a negative 1. So you decide if you want to keep the spell so you can use it again…
MARIS:
Um, no, I’ll-I’ll…
SEA:
You’ll let it go?
MARIS:
I’ll let it go.
SEA:
Okay. So you cast Hold Person.
MARIS:
So… yeah, here… sorry… here you go. You can read it. There.
SEA:
Yeah. Sooooo… until you leave their presence, they cannot act except to speak. Cool. Okay, and so, what happens? Wh-what do we see?
MARIS:
So Darcy gets up and, uh, throws out her hands towards Jacklyn and Jacklyn suddenly just freezes on the spot, the pail in mid-air coming through on a swing. And they look a bit shocked. But they cannot move and they’re stock still.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Huuuuh. Wait… what have you done?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I’m so sorry I had to do that Jacklyn. This really has nothing about you. And we have nothing against you or Jill but we are trying to save the world. And we really need this bucket.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
No, no, no, please! I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I just… Jill was everything to me. And I’ve never told her. I need to tell her. You have to help me find Jill. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I won’t attack you again. Please.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How can I be sure of that ‘cos…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I swear on my father.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…my friend is looking really woozy. You’ve hit him twice in the head now.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(slightly dazed)
I’m good. Put me into play!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
OK… look… take… look… can you take my bucket and give me Jill’s bucket?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(to Eggerton)
I don’t know. Can we?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Look at all the candle lights they put up to let people know that I’m performing tonight.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK, I think I have to make that decision. Uh, no, I don’t think I can. I think I need this bucket. But… but… but… but!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
But I’m the one that goes to get the water. She never gets the water.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You mean… you always get the water?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Yes. She always waits for me and I go up the hill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Alright. We’ll take… your bucket.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And we’ll help you find Jill.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Now I’m gonna let you go now.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And, if you try anything…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I won’t. This is really weird.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There might be a big scary creature who appears here so you better just stay calm.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve been trying to lose weight and those kinds of words are hurt…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m not talking about you Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
S‑sorry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s fine. Now you should eat a fairy cake.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s a good idea.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
What’s a fairy cake?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, you wanna have one with me?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s really yummy. Okay…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I can’t move.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…let me… let me do the talking, Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARIS:
So I throw my hands again towards Jacklyn. And they can suddenly move.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re welcome.
SEA:
Jacklyn sets their bucket down at your feet.
MARIS:
And I pass Jill’s bucket to Jacklyn.
SEA:
They cradle it.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so I’m… I’m gonna have a fairy cake now. Uh, I’ve got, you know, classic purple swirly here.
SEA:
Roll for fairy cake.
MICHAE:
Rolling for fairy cakes.
MARIS:
Too long since we’ve heard that. What is it?
MICHAE:
That’s a 5. With bonuses.
SEA:
It doesn’t taste right.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(smacking his lips)
Is this one of the poison ones?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you make poison ones?!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, only sometimes just in case someone tries to sneak into my cache.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton! You should have separate pouches then for the…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(retching noise)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, no. Oh no.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
No, it’s OK… everything’s gonna be… hurp!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Use the bucket… just use the bucket.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, okay, thank… it’s a good thing we found this…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Oh not…
(sighing)
Oh… OK.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Use the… use the bucket.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Hoarkkkkkkkkkkk! Oh God! No, it’s OK… no, it’s… I think the worst of it’s—
(as if the depths of hell have opened up)
Ooooooooaaaaarrggghhhh!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’ll-I’ll go get some water.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Water would be very… Ooooohhhhharrrrkkkkkk!!
(weakly)
I’ll never do it again. GAKARGGHHHHHH!
(weeping ensues)
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Here. I brought some water.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
WHOOGGGHHHHHHH!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Um… I’ll just… uh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you. Uh… thank you, Jacklyn.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Can I pour this into something?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’ll-I’ll do this. I’ll just drink it.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
You’re not drinking from this!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
BLEEUUUGHHHH!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
You’re not putting your… those lips on Jill’s bucket.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
OK… I’ll scoop… I’ll scoop out of your bucket.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
No! You’re not putting that hand in Jill’s bucket.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh no… I didn’t puu…
(more retching)
Oh okay, that was not good now either.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Does anybody have a flask?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy? Do you have a canteen in your… in your bag?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, yes I do. Here, here.
MARIS:
And I pull it out and I dip it into the bucket and I bring it over to Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. AAAHHHGGGUUUUGH!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, no more poison fairycakes.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’ll try and remember that.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Why do you… why are you eating poison… why do you have poison…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He thinks through things in a strange manner. We don’t like to ask questions a lot.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
OK.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
These things just happen.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Can… can someone please…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
BLEEEUUUGHHH-UUGGHH-UGGGH!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Can you please… can we step over here? Can you just go over what happened again? And… and what can we do to find Jill?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, yeah, let’s… let’s go over here. Um, okay, so… I don’t know what happened to Jill. She disappeared. Is there somewhere in your… this world… because you know… of course my world too… why would it be a strange world… uh… this place that we’re in that, um, has recently seen some dark times or having trouble? Uh, anywhere that used to be light and unicorns and rainbows and now isn’t?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
There’s unicorns?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh well, nah… it’s just a metaphor really.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Oh, that’d be cool.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Like, uh, your village. Wayward? Is that what it’s called? Is everything okay there?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Um, yeah, no. Well, I mean, I don’t really fit in. And I’m not really supposed to be seeing Jill but… but that’s always… like…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s not really what I’m… I’m sorry about that. And… and I hope you and Jill live happily ever after once we find her. But um, but I just mean like, something dark going on. Like any creepy people around anywhere.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
HEEUGGHHAAAAGGGHHHHHH!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Well, that’s a little weird.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, but he’s with me so…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Oh. No, I haven’t heard anything. Um, it’s like… you know that feeling where you’re just doing everything again?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Really?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You mean like things were… rebooted?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I don’t know what that means but yeah, like… like I’ve done this before. And it’s… but not always, like this seems new. But some things are just like… the same.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, I‑I could see that. Um… just give us…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
They should have a word for that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… Deja vu?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
No, like a good word for that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, if you just wait here I have to talk to my friend.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(under her breath)
If he can talk.
(to Jacklyn)
Just hold on for a minute.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’m gonna inspect this bucket and see if there’s anything…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We also have to clean out our bucket. So…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
Eggerton!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
There’s a well at the top.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you feeling better?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
But be careful. It’s slippery.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I‑I’m feeling much better now, thank you. I think I got it all out of… AUUAAAGHHHH! Okay, that was the last of it. I can see the fairy cake in there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, gosh. Oh, boy. Okay, I hope this doesn’t lower the value of this artifact. We’re gonna have to clean it out really well.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I‑I’m pretty sure that you gave the artifacts to Jacklyn.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! No, listen, I don’t think I messed this up because remember… the weird, possessive person said that they were waiting for the bucket. And… and if that’s the bucket that was supposed to get the water which is Jacklyn’s, not Jill’s, then I actually think we have the right bucket. So we did swappy-swap-swap and I think that’s the right thing in the end. Oh my gosh, I’m sounding like you.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, you’re finally starting to make sense.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Now if only we had some way to test if this bucket had the Shatter… well it has some stuff in it… but if it also had the Shattering in it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
Yes! That’s brilliant, Generalissimo. Here. Use your detector….
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, it’s Eggerton. Not Lissimo.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, sorry about that. Use your detector, uh…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, my Ice‑T. Which we’re not allowed to drink apparently. Uh, okay, so I’m gonna turn it to this little circly Detect setting…
SEA:
And it glows green… meaning there is no Shattering left in this world.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
There’s no Shattering left in the world at all. That’s… so… what’s the…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(darkly)
Oh no.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
But the bucket could still be the artifact even if it doesn’t have the Shattering…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Can it be? Is Jill the artifact we needed?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe. If only Moira had taken time to really explain how some of this exposion… expish… If only Moira…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You have been hit on the head multiple times. It’s okay. It’s okay. I‑I know what you’re saying Eggerton. I‑I know what you’re saying. Um, Moira’s chapping my ass a bit, I have to tell you but listen… you might be right… we… we might have the wrong artifact so I told Jacklyn we’ll help them find Jill. And that’s what I think we have to do. But the thing is, I don’t know if Jill is on this world anymore.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
BLEEEUGGGGHHHH! Okay, no, that’s definitely the end. That’s the end of it. Okay, so what if we… wait… wait… why don’t we ask Moira… she might know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
First of all…(starts coughing)
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, it’s very smelly. I’m sorry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
First of all, since you gave yourself a poison fairy cake I think I better help you with your wounds there.
MARIS:
So I reach out and I touch him and I use Cure Light Wounds.
SEA:
Roll for Spell.
MARIS:
…which is…
SEA:
Oh, no, it’s a…
MARIS:
No, it’s a rote.
Yeah, it’s a rote. So, uh, you get to roll 1d8 and heal yourself of 1d8 damage.
SEA:
…a rote. Cool.
Do you get a plus on wis… I think or no…
MARIS:
Uh, not… no, I don’t think so.
SEA:
OK… cool. So, roll 1d8.
MARIS:
Don’t roll a 1.
MICHAE:
1d8. 5!
SEA:
You get 5 hit points back. That’s really good.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
So what do we see? What happens?
MARIS:
OK.
SEA:
Do we see anything?
MARIS:
Yeah, when I touch Eggerton, there’s a faint glow that encompasses him and, uh… and he looks also glowy and tinkly.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I feel much better now. It’s like all of the poison has left my system but that, um, bucket full of… you know, the smell…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
…is big… big… big…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no, no, no,
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Heerrpppp!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
It’s just… it’s kind of… heearrrppp!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve never been good around… you know…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Eggerton!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Heerpppp! Just take the bucket… take the bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m taking the bucket.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
HEERRPPPP!
MARIS:
So I run up to the top of the hill and I douse the bucket into the well and I clean it out as best I can.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(calling)
Did you put all the puke in the well?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I did what I had to do Eggerton!
MARIS:
And I run back down the hill… with the bucket. And…
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger; it’s slippery and you’re running.
MARIS:
Oh, come on! So that is…
MARISA & SEA:
2d6.
MARIS:
Plus Dex, I guess?
SEA:
Yup.
MARIS:
That is a Nine… but I still think that’s a partial fail.
SEA:
Sooooo…
MARIS:
I stumble, hesitate or flinch.
SEA:
So, basically Darcy comes down, starts to slip, starts to fall. The bucket goes flying out of Darcy’s hands.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Woah! Wooahhh!
SEA:
…as she tumbles head over heels…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oooaaahhh… ooouuuf….ouuuuf!
SEA:
…and lands next to you all.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! Ohhhh.
SEA:
And her head, her crown, strikes a root… for 1d4 damage.
MARIS:
Three.
SEA:
Three hit points damage.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
So the crown was a metaphor.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Actually, it’s a normal term for your head… never mind… it doesn’t matter. Ouch! That hurt.
SEA:
Jacklyn kneels down beside you.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Are-are you okay?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I‑I’m okay. I think I’m just a little shaken up.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’ve done it many times. Here, I‑I’ll go refill that for you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, don’t really need it refilled. I’m…
SEA:
Jacklyn goes back up the hill to get water.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(calling after them)
I just want an empty bucket!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
Did Jacklyn leave the first bucket?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know which bucket…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, hold on, I’m gonna turn on my thing quick and test that bucket. Click.
SEA:
There is no Shattering in this world. It is green.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think either bucket has the Shattering.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
What we need to do is ask Moira what to do in this situation.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We have to find Jill; that’s what we have to do. She’s the artifact!
I‑No, because the Shattering, who I take to be very honest, said that the bucket was the artifact…
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You take the Shattering to be very honest?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you know, we had a very good conversation and I feel like when you really sit down and you try and work things out, you have to start somewhere. So I’m giving…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s called the Shattering.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. And there’s no illusion about…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It talks like this.
(in evil voice)
“Hello. I am the Shattering; I am here to be your friend.” That doesn’t sound very un-evil to me.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
That is exactly how you sound in the morning.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, that’s fair. I’ll give you that. That’s very true.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But then I become less evil throughout the day.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Ehhhhh… Okay, so I’m gonna… I’m gonna call Moira real quick while Jacklyn’s, you know, gettin’ water from the puke well.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’m right… right here.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, heh, heh, heh, heh! I‑you didn’t scare me. You’re very quick, aren’t you? Yeah, it’s… it’s… you’re Jacklyn of the Hill, I guess we could say. Uh, is that what you’re called? No?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’m from Wayward.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
You’re wayward. Well…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey Eggerton, why… why don’t you go over by that tree over there…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…and do your business.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’m going to go urinate against this tree.
And maybe talk to myself and sometimes my pee sounds like a woman talking back to me so don’t be alarmed.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay thanks… too much…
Okay… too much information! Thanks Eggerton, thanks Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
It happened to me as a child.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ah yes.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay… I’m going…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Remember… many times on the head with your bucket. You…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Would you like the bucket of water?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, thank you… I‑I will take that. In fact, I can carry both buckets if you like.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
That’s okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, you take that bucket. So, uh, where do you think we should start looking for Jill?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
You guys aren’t from here, are you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What gave that away?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Uh, the glowing bracelets. The glowing when you touched him. I‑I’m not stupid. Um…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re not from here.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I know. I‑I’ll… I’ll do anything to help find Jill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Here’s the problem. I don’t think Jill’s any longer from here either.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think she’s… somewhere else.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Then I’ll go with you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Really? It-It could be dangerous.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I will do anything to find Jill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You are really handy with that bucket.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’m really good with bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, we could use some people who are good in battle. We are not so good.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I‑I got that.
MICHAE:
Cut to… shaking off in the trees. Eggerton turns the switch on his medallion to Coms.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, Moira. Moira. Moira, are you in there?
SEA:
(static noise)
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh Moira, where are you when… this is why I wanted Ananka because she always answered the medallion even when I was in the cage outside the castle.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
This is Knight 14735.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
Proceed with message.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Umm… hi. It’s Eggerton from… the… adventuring party. Uhhhh, you know, from the end of time.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
Your message has been delivered.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
No…
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
Thank you.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
That wasn’t the message. Okay.
SEA:
(static noise)
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh… okay gotta start over. Okay, I’m gonna try again. Click. M‑Moira. Are you there?Moira?
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
This is Knight 14735. Proceed with message.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, Moira… so we came across the Shattering… the Shattering was in this person. The person then got disappeared but left the bucket without…
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
Your message has been delivered to Moira.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Okay, I’m gonna do one more. I can get it out in one go. I am known for my brevity. Okay, so click. Hello Knight?
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
This is Knight 14735.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’m ready this time.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
The message machine is full.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh no!
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
Please call back later.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Ahhhhh… always happens to me. Well, at least it’s not like those newfenangled medallions who don’t even set up their voicemail knights. Anyway…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(calling to him)
Eggerton! How’s the, um, urinating going?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Um, I’m having a problem with the stream. Could you come help?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Nope. Um, why don’t you just come out here and tell me what the problem is?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Because it’s a Moira kind of problem. And I feel that it would be best served if you came over here and helped with the Moira stream of urine.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry, Jacklyn. This is gonna seem strange to you. It’s just how we do this on our world. I’ll be right back. Just one second.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Please don’t leave me here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I‑I’m not leaving you. I’m just going over to that shrub over there.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Please promise me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I won’t leave you.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s all fine.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’ll wait here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
MARIS:
So I walk over to the bush.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispering)
Wh-what’s wrong?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
So I called and I tried to leave a message but the knight didn’t give me enough time so I tried a couple more times and then it ran out of space on the message machine.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What knight?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
The knight that answered… uh… 117–47, or something.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(exasperated)
She has the knights answering her communication devices now?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Apparently. And you know I thought they were kind of friendly… he was a little on the rude side but, you know, I would be too if I had to carry all that plate mail around all day.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(in exasperation)
Huhhhhh… so what you’re saying is you did not get in contact with her.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
No. I thought we could try your medallion in case maybe mine was rerouted somehow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um, you just said all the space was used up. My medallion isn’t gonna make any difference.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, maybe your medallion goes to a different knight.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hmm. Yeah, but I still think all the space would be used up.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
So maybe we could try your medallion and just see what happens.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine! Here… take my medallion.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh I guess…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You try it.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent. Okay, I’ll turn it on. Uh, hello? Hello Moira?
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
This is Knight 14735. Please leave a message.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, Shattering here. Took Jill, we need Jill back, we have a bucket, I don’t know what to do with it. What’s the artifact? Call us back. Bye. Love you.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
Your message has been delivered. Please say “one” if you want to see other delivery options.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! One!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why would you say “one”?!
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
Your message has been deleted.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Noooo! Okay. Okay, we got to try again. We got to try again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
GAHHHHHHH!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Start over.
MICHAE:
Cut to 45 minutes later.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Moira! Shattering! Jill! Gone! Buckets! call us!
SEAN (AS KNIGHT 14735)
Your message has been delivered. Please say “one” if you want more delivery options.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
No.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Good. Just give it back to me. Give it back to me.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
OK, OK… here you go, here you go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(grudgingly)
Alright, fine. Your idea worked. I owe you an apology Eggerton. Sometimes you have good ideas.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
That wasn’t an apology.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, I’m sorry that I doubted your good idea.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re welcome.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so uh…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
P.S.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re now taking Jacklyn with us on all of our travellings. Okay, let’s go.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe she can hang out with, um, Scribbles.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe they would like to do that. I don’t know. I guess now we just wait until we hear back from Moira because I don’t even know how to get out of this place now.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
But we can just turn the dial and push the button.
SEA:
Your medallions begin to chime.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Ohh! Ohhh… ohhh! It’s chim….OK. OK. I’m gonna answer mine first. Hello. This is Eggerton.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(curtly)
Is Darcy there?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
May I speak with her?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well she’s right next to me. She can hear you.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello!
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Why do I have 175 messages?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s actually my…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I am travelling with Eggerton, Moira. I think you can put two and two together. That makes a hundred and ninety-three or whatever you just said.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Okay. Is there Shattering in your world?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, no, actually it’s all gone.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Do you have an artifact?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, so we have two artifacts…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Perfect.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait… wait, there’s no Shattering on any of them. So, I’m sorry… I’m a little fuzzy on this. Does that mean they’re good artifacts or not?
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Okay, if there’s Shattering you’re not supposed to bring anything back; it’s been very clear. If there’s no Shattering you bring back an artifact.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! So wait… we might be fine. I think we have the right artifact.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
OK… so we can take pretty much anything…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
(under her breath)
Oh god….
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
…and be like “Hey, it’s an artifact.”
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
It has to be pertinent to the story.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Look, I found a blade of grass… that Jill stepped on.
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
Pertinent to the story. Okay, you know what,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, we have two…
SEAN (AS MOIRA)
I don’t care what you bring back…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
…and this is going to be the artifact that we bring back and put in the Artifact Museum. Because nobody…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
…seems to… what? What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yup.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let’s listen for a minute.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I was listening.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let’s use our listening skills.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I was listening.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Moira, we have two buckets; does it matter which one we bring back?
SEA:
Your medallions are not operating. They are dead.
MARIS:
Oh…‘cos we didn’t recharge them.
MICHAE:
Okay, I’m putting mine back to Recharge.
MARIS:
I’m putting mine on Recharge.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I think we should take the buckets and take it to Celene and trade an artifact from a Storyverse for Blat.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! We’re not doing that, Eggerton.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
But then we’d have Blat back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I want to get Blat back too, but I think there’s another way. And also we have to help this Jacklyn person find Jill.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
We can do that too, but I’d like to hear your other way.
SEA:
We pull out, seeing Darcy and Eggerton continue to go back and forth, while sitting on a stump nearby, Jacklyn watches looking from one to the other. We pull back until they are but dots.
THE SWAM:
Grinding guitar chords.
SEA:
We cut to a small hut in a swamp. The roof of the hut has been ripped open, and a darkness that is darker than the night flows down from the sky and fills this hut as a little old lady cackles in the corner.
And in the centre of this darkness is a cauldron bubbling and in it… is Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)

I’m Darcy. What’s your name?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Jill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And you have… a bucket.
SEA:
Jill’s head turns, and you see dark, black eyes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Shattering!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shattering!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Found it!
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
So, to stop me, you’re going to march on entire worlds and massacre everyone in them?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aren’t… aren’t you trying to end time?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Ask Moira who created the bomb.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’ll take the bucket.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
And I’ll take this.
A violent rumbling noise.
SEAN (AS JILL)
(voice distorting)
What’s happening?
(screams)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Holy crackers!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
They took Jill!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Hey! Hello!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you by any chance Jacklyn?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Why do you have Jill’s bucket?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh-oh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that’s kind of our bucket now—
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Aaaaaagh!
The whoosh and clang of the bucket smacking Eggerton.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
You have to help me find Jill!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
“One shall rise to claim his throne / And the earth shall be overthrown”?
Wait a second.
SEAN (AS THE LITTLE OLD LADY)
Come in, come in. Close the door behind you.
Now, if you’ll just climb into the cauldron.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It seems I have an old dark character living within me, by the name of—
SEAN (AS THE LITTLE OLD LADY)
Yes! Yes! Say her name!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Morri… gu?
A huge peal of lightning.

We return to a storyverse that is green, in a meadow where we hear the soft sound of mosquitoes and bugs. And we come down on a sunny day, but with a cool breeze and the scent of trees and earth. And we see Eggerton off in the distance by some trees talking to… we’re not sure what. And Darcy is nearby, and Jacklyn is standing by, holding on to their bucket.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, what are you doing?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I was just having a conversation with this squirrel. He says that he thinks it’ll take about three hours for the ICE-Ts to charge. But the sparrow over here says probably only 20 minutes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I guess we’ll just have to wait and see, won’t we?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Okay, well, we could do that. Or we can just turn the thing and push the button now.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Hey, um… remember, you said you were going to take me with you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We plan to take you with us. But we need our special devices to charge, you see, to go anywhere.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay. How long is that going to take?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, somewhere between 20 minutes, three hours according to the local fauna.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The frog over here that’s sort of heading towards that pond, he said two weeks. But I don’t know if I trust him because he’s hippity hopping. And if something seems to be hippity hopping, it’s probably not going to be all that accurate, just generally as a rule. I’d be more inclined to go with the squirrel but squirrels are also very forgetful—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Is he okay?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m doing very well! Thank you for asking. So what I think we should do is just turn and just start pushing the button every five minutes or so and see what happens.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I was just going to say why don’t you press the button? That’s not a bad idea.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m gonna press the button. Ready? Ready? Everyone ready?
SEA:
And Eggerton disappears.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
What just happened?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So it’s working, that’s the good news…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I thought we were gonna walk somewhere.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The bad news is, I don’t know where he went. So… what we’re going to try and do is the same thing, and you just have to hold my hand.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay. But we’re just going to disappear?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um, it’s probably going to feel a little funny. It’s nothing like walking or riding on a wagon. But don’t get nervous! You’ll be fine and you’ll be in a different place when you open your eyes.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’m not nervous. I’ll do anything for Jill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, here we go, then. So take my hand. And I’m just going to push this button… and here we go!
ANNOUNCE:
The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy role playing game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your Game Master is Sean Howard, with players Marisa King, Michael Howie and Carter Siddall. Episode 19: Point of Contact.
THE VOI:
SEA:
Everything goes to black. And you see Eggerton frozen in half-motion in the air in the blackness, unmoving. And you suddenly realise that you can’t move, Darcy. And it’s hard to breathe. It’s just the blackness pressing all around you. And you see floating, not too far ahead of you, what looks like Jill from the hill… sort of as if you can see half through Jill. And everyone is just frozen in the air.
MARIS:
Is Jacklyn there?
SEA:
Yes, Jacklyn is beside you, eyes wide. You can move your eyes, and maybe a little bit of muscle movement, but it’s really hard., as if all the blackness is just pressing down on you, as if you’re at a deep pressure.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(straining)
Eeehhh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(straining)
Eehhhh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Eeeeehhh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eeeehh!
SEA:
And you feel half of Jill’s voice and half of the Shattering’s voice mixed together in your minds, as if strangely disconnected—because Jill’s lips aren’t moving.
SEAN (AS JILL)
There you are.
We don’t have long.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Eeeehh!
SEAN (AS JILL)
Just think the thoughts you wish to communicate
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m kind of hungry right now and I needed to go to the bathroom before I left but I forgot to do that. I probably should have done that before I went.
SEAN (AS JILL)
This was a mistake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How can I go to the bathroom in the void? I feel frozen but I need to go. Does my bladder have muscles? I don’t really understand how that works…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(simultaneous)
We really need to know what’s happened to Jill. What have you done to Jill? What’s going on? Where’s this voice coming from?
SEAN (AS JILL)
Okay! Enough!
We don’t have long. I am going to give you both a device. When you are at a place of power, you can use it to summon a connection to me so that we may talk on heard.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What is a place of power?
SEAN (AS JILL)
It is a place of power! It is a place where the walls are lowered between worlds.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, that.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think what we’re kind of asking is whether or not there’s like, a beacon on here or some kind of map? If there’s a map with an X on it… one time I had a map with an X on it and…
SEAN (AS JILL)
You are being monitored. Always.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right now we’re being monitored? Even when I’m thinking about needing to pee? ‘Cause that’s kind of embarrassing—
SEAN (AS JILL)
Not now. You are not being monitored.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh.
SEAN (AS JILL)
Take this.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t.
SEA:
And Jill’s hand slowly moves. And you can feel Jacklyn’s panic—as if Jacklyn, you can feel Jacklyn forcing themselves forward towards Jill.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Will you let Jill come with us?
SEA:
And Jill disappears.
And there’s a… something. Someone’s going to tell me what it is.
MIK:
It’s an apple.
SEA:
There’s an apple coming towards you both in the blackness getting clearer and clearer. And you’re really having trouble moving anything on your bodies.
MIK:
I slowly open my mouth with a great deal of will.
SEA:
(laughs)
Okay, can you please roll, let’s call this… let’s call this…
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
Defy Danger +Strength?
MIK:
That’s a 5.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
So the apple passes Eggerton.
MIK:
(straining)
SEA:
It’s coming towards you, Darcy.
MARIS:
So with all my strength, I’m trying trying to reach both my hands out for it. So at least one of them grabs it, and I’m pushing and pushing through the void.
SEA:
Please roll +Strength.
MARIS:
Two dice?
SEA:
Yup, and add your Strength modifier.
(laughs)
Also zero.
MIK:
We’re strong!
MARIS:
The apple will just pass us by. We’ll be stuck here forever.
MIK:
(laughs)
MARIS:
(laughing)
It’s a 4.
SEA:
Okay, and it passes right through Darcy’s arms. And you sense Jacklyn moving their body. You hear almost like a tendon ripping sound, as Jacklyn gets a hand on the apple. And time restores as a flash of lights—just like the normal transportation, but more disorienting now as all these realities collide and leave.
And you are suddenly standing in the hallway of doors inside the Nexus or the Academy of the Fallen.
BACK TO SCHOO:
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(chomps)
Missed it!
Wait, wait! Oh, Jill! Jacklyn. Jacklyn!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
It’s Jacklyn.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, Jacklyn! Sorry.
SEA:
Jacklyn is holding one arm but in the hand is an apple.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Good job getting the apple. Okay, hand that over—I will hold on to it, I’m a bit snacky.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It was lucky they were with us. Now. Jacklyn, are you okay? You look like your shoulder’s hurting.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Yeah, I pulled something but I’m okay. Do you want me to give the apple to…?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Give it to me. To me.
(over Eggerton’s protests)
I will take the apple. I will take the shiny red apple away from Eggerton who is hungry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(grumbles)
Fine.
SEA:
Jacklyn hands it to Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is a secret device that have to keep safe!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s a sacred device that looks like a tasty apple.
SEA:
(laughing)
Write down that you have a sacred apple device.
MARIS:
Writing down “sacred apple device”.
MIK:
Also known as a Mac too.
Laughter.
SEA:
So Jacklyn takes some—can someone roll a 1d4 for me? The pyramid?
MIK:
That’s… 2.
SEA:
Thank you. 2 Damage on Jacklyn. Cool.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, you know what? We could call it a Magical Apple Controller. And then it’s a MAC.
MARIS:
Got it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yup.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right? Right?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(humouring him)
Winky wink wink.
SEA:
The knights are moving through this hall, sort of shoving you guys against the walls. And you see doors opening and two by two, knights going marching through these large doorways, coming into other doors as the portals open and deposit them. And they’re coming in groups. It’s endless. Just two by two, knights coming and going in and out doors.
And Jacklyn is just staring in amazement, like shaking a little.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So Jacklyn, don’t worry. This is our base of operations. This is where we come from. And this is where we’re going to regroup and figure out how to get Jill back and—
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
(breathless)
Jill was right there. I couldn’t move! I couldn’t get her.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I know. I think she might have been possessed. And we’ve got to figure out what’s going on before we can get her back.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I want to go back. Which door?! Which door do I take?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, there isn’t a door you can take right now. You just have to wait and sit down, and… Would you like a cup of tea? Or a fairy cake perhaps. Eggerton makes very good fairy cakes—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I have fairy cakes here! Okay, let’s see what we got. We got a blue one that’s kind of cube-shaped. We’ve got a green one that’s kind of decahedron shaped…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Your most relaxing one, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ohhh.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Look, I just want to get back to Jill. I’m fine. I’m good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay. I call it the MK Ultra cupcake.
Here, have one of these. It’s just little, it’s green. It’s got nice little red flecks in it. Have that.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Is this safe?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s very safe.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s all good.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay.
SEA:
And Jacklyn takes a bite. Roll for fairy cakes. Do you get a bonus?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That is an 8.
SEA:
Okay, so… Marisa, give me what effect. Is it dizzy, drunk…
MARIS:
Is this a negative effect?
SEA:
Yup.
MARIS:
Confu… No, she’s already confused, that’s boring. Um… irrationally angry.
SEA:
So Jacklyn bites down on the fairy cake, and get some hit points back. So roll the hit points for me.
MIK:
What were the hit points on it again?
SEA:
It’s right in the move on your sheet.
MIK:
I’m sure it is, but…
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
You have one sheet. Darcy over here has 17 sheets.
MARIS:
That’s why I can’t find the right sheet.
MIK:
1d… yeah, well I’m lazy. So…
SEA:
That’s a d10.
MIK:
It’s an 8.
(rolls)
1.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
You get your bonus on that. +Wisdom.
MIK:
+Wisdom is 2.
SEA:
So fully healed. You’re rolling great.
So Jacklyn bites down, gets 2 hit points back. And then you just see Jacklyn’s features set. And Jacklyn spins on both of you, stepping backwards.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
What have you done? What are you doing? Jill was right there! You—you’re part of this. You…!
SEA:
And Jacklyn brandishes the bucket, which already has a dent on it that matches Eggerton’s head.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I said the relaxing one! The relaxing one!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It took a dark turn! That happens sometimes! I don’t always have control over it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(growls)
Argh!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Bring me back to the darkness with Jill! Now!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Jacklyn, you have to listen to me. We can’t do that. It doesn’t work that way—
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Arrrrgh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Aaaa!
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger. You can make an argument for Strength or Dex.
MARIS:
I will make an argument for whichever is my strongest… which is Dex.
SEA:
So tell me what you’re doing that would involve your Dex.
MARIS:
Okay, so I’m actually hinging at my waist. I’m like, lying backwards kind of thing.
SEA:
Like bullet time.
MARIS:
That’s right, like bullet time in The Matrix.
SEA:
Yup.
MARIS:
Okay. 2d6, right?
SEA:
Plus your Dex bonus.
MARIS:
Yep. Which is huge. It’s 1.
MIK:
It’s “yuge”.
MARIS:
Ahh! That’s a 12! That’s a 13!
SEA:
Darcy just bends like a willow at the waist dashing around, the bucket in slow motion just grazing over her nose. And Jacklyn’s eyes going wide as Darcy comes right back up on the other side. And what do you do now?
MARIS:
Well, I think first of all, as I’m coming out, my left leg kicks the bucket out of her hand; it flies over, lands right around Eggerton’s neck. It’s just hanging there. And Darcy now has Jacklyn in sort of a hug hold.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Agh! Let me go! What are you doing?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Calm down, Jacklyn.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Argh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s okay. It’s okay. We’re just going to take you to our room where you can lie down for a bit while we figure things out. Eggerton! Help me take them to our room.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, but look! I can just put food in this and eat it without my hands.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! You will get food in a minute.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I want my bucket back!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’ve got the bucket right here—
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I want Jill’s bucket!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s good. It’s all good. We’re all going to be calm. No one’s going to panic. I’ve got a bucket.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
(holding themselves back)
I’m really angry right now. I don’t even know why.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sing the Calming Song, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The Calming Song! I will sing it!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sing the Calming Song!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sings)
Oh calm… calm down… no clowns are eating you…
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay, make him stop.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sings)
Be relaxed and calm…
Are you going to calm down?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’m calm down. Just please make him stop.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(singing)
…the elephants are your friends!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That was your best version yet. Thank you for that.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you. Thank you.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Can I have Jill’s bucket? Please.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m gonna put the bucket around your neck now. You will note—
SEA:
Jacklyn just snatches the bucket.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, you’ve got it. But I would like to point out that the around-the-neck feeding thing is technically mine. If you want to use it, I’m okay with that—
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
I’m not a horse.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, you don’t need to call me names. All I’m saying is—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, everyone. Jacklyn has their bucket. And I’m sure the fairy cake is going to wear off soon because I feel like this is related. So let’s just take you to our room. Okay?
MARIS:
And I lead Jacklyn up the stairs to our room.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
But we are going to figure out how to get Jill?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s the first thing we’re going to do. I just have to talk to my compatriot here, Eggerton, and we’re going to figure it all out.
SEA:
Okay. And which one of you has the other bucket?
Laughter.
MARISA AND MIK:
There’s another bucket?
SEA:
You traded buckets with Jacklyn so Jacklyn has—
MARIS:
I think I have it.
SEA:
Okay, cool.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Technically, I’m the General and she’s the lieutenant, so “compatriots”—not quite accurate. It’s more of a boss-employee type relationship.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(dryly)
Yes, my liege.
SEA:
So you walk out on the second floor, out of the hidden doors that lead to the hall. You came in at the second floor and you walked up, just so you know. You guys are on the third floor, where the dormitories are. But there are knights everywhere: the dormitories, except for yours, all the other dormitories are full, and knights are just marching up and down the hallways.
The place smells different. It smells like rooms that have been dusty forever that are now all being disturbed and kicked up. It smells like steel and rust and oiled pleather and armour and sharpening oil. And there’s just this constant din of noise, whereas before it was relatively quiet, as knights in full armour are constantly clanging up and down the hallways. And you find your dormitory.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me! Excuse me—will you stop for—argh! They’re everywhere! Okay. In here, Jacklyn, into this room. I can’t even hear myself think.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT)
(booming, mechanical voice)
You are not authorised to stop.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But, uh, as General, I demands passage under the authority of the Truncated Moira Act of 037‑B.
SEAN (AS KNIGHT)
You are not authorised to stop.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve got a bucket? That—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We are not stopping! We’re going into this room. This is our residence. Thank you very much. Here we go.
MARIS:
And I open the door and I usher us all in, and I close the door.
SEA:
Okay, and the room is relatively untouched. You see Blat’s cot, still perfectly made as he always leaves it, and all his folded shirts.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs)
SEA:
And you see Eggerton’s messy cot, and Darcy, you see your cot and the other cots that are untouched.
MARIS:
So I avoid looking at Blat’s cot, and I just guide Jacklyn over to mine. And I say,
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Just sit down, just give me a moment. A lot has changed here. We need to talk.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Actually, if you could go sit on that cot. This cot is technically where I dry fairy cakes, and sometimes Blat would put the bazooka—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re going to leave Jacklyn on this cot for the moment.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m just saying that’s not the purpose of that cot.. Your cot specifically is for the bazooka and for the sound of that elephant under the bed.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right now it’s for Jacklyn. Eggerton, would you join me over here in the other corner of the room please?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I accept your invitation!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why thank you, General.
(lowers her voice)
Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m having some concerns that maybe Moira isn’t everything we thought she was.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, she won’t let me get Ananka’s recipes. Clearly she’s jealous of my kitchen.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Let’s focuse. Let’s focus for a minute. Everything is different here. There’s knights everywhere. It’s like she’s preparing a huge army. And normally I would think, great! because that’s going to finish this finally, and we can just go back where we came from. But then we have this voice telling us that maybe Moira has some really underhanded things going on. And now I don’t know who to believe. And I’m just not sure we can trust her anymore. And who do we trust?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You’re talking too much.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re right. I am.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And I just I need you to slow down.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So what I think we should do is probably just go down the kitchen and start baking, because that always helps me kind of just sort out my thoughts and clear my mind and find a way to go forward with things. And then we can talk to Jacklyn. Oh, maybe Jacklyn has some—do you think they have different recipes in their world?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Eggerton? Let me put this in words you can understand.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We might be the bad people right now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t think that’s—nooo.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We might be the people who hate fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes! And stomp on flowers and cut down trees.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?! Augh!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Um, Darcy…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Nothing’s wrong over here, Jacklyn! Everything’s fine!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Everything’s wrong! Auuugh!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
No, but… Is this supposed to be happening?
A rumbling, roaring sound, growing slowly louder.
SEA:
And you see, not too far from Blat’s cot, this swirling black portal-like opening in between worlds starting to open up. And you see one of the cots sort of being pulled a little towards it and you feel a bit of a pull of air against you all.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The only time I’ve seen anything like this is when you would eat too much food. I’ve never seen this!
SEA:
And it’s growing bigger and there’s this pressure change. It’s causing your ears to pop. And you start to sort of see a vague outline, as if there is someone or something there, quite large on the other side of this portal, trying to push through. And then the portal starts to shrink and then it gets bigger again. And this swirling darkness.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Uh, is this normal?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think you have to maybe realign the concept of normal now for yourself.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is it Jill?!
SEA:
And you see Jacklyn get up and start moving towards the portal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Wait. No…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Step away from the swirliness! Step away.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve got a telegram from Jill that says, “Dear Jacklyn: How fondly I remember thee and miss you greatly. However I am not in swirly black things of doom; please do not look for me there. Always, Jacklyn. Uh, Jill.”
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
He’s reading a fairy cake.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
What is going on?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so if you come over here, I’ll show you that there’s writing on it and it’ll all make sense. C’mere!
SEA:
And you hear alarms sounding, distant in the building.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s also… that’s just saying that… it’s time for our next class. And get there quick because you don’t want to get a tardy slip!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, wait, wait!
MARIS:
And I pull out the apple and I try to talk to it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy, it’s an apple.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He said…!
SEA:
So a lot’s going on. You hear alarms; this portal is like, growing and shrinking in size; your ears are popping.
As you pull out the apple, you notice that there’s two halves, like it’s not quite connected.
MARIS:
Yeah.
SEA:
Like, they turn, the two halves.
MARIS:
Okay. So I turn it to connect the two halves.
A metallic click that hangs in the air.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
(nervous snickering)
SEA:
Two things happen, so quickly on top of each other. First, the portal solidifies and you see a Slaad stumble forward that you recognize. Looks maybe like Lazbo.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So what I’m say—
His voice slows and hangs in the middle of the word “saying”, becoming an eerie background hum.
An ominous, grinding rhythm begins.
SEA:
And everything freezes. Everybody in the room just stops moving except for Darcy.
You just see everyone frozen in this tableau. The sounds have halted, the portal isn’t moving. And this blackness starts to pour out of the apple and rise up into a form.
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
Ah! Darcy. You—
(dawning realization)
Oh… you summoned me from within the Nexus?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That… might have been a mistake?
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
(sighs)
I’m sorry, Darcy. I can’t pass up this opportunity.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whimpers)
SEAN (AS THE SHATTERING)
I hope you understand.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No?
SEA:
And the darkness shoots out through the doors, through the walls, into eight different forms and disappears.
And time resumes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(quiet sobbing)
MIDROL:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey, everyone, Sean here. Thank you so much for tuning in. I have a couple of quick announcements. But I also at first want to give some shout outs to our most recent supporters. We’re going to start doing that on every episode. So I want to give a super shout out to Rachel, Ryan and notabeanie. Thank you so much for your support. It means everything for us and we can’t wait to get more content out for you.
Now, for all of you—I don’t know what to call you—legacy folks? That doesn’t sound good. It sounds like you’re like a Windows 95 user. Like, all of you early adopters! The originals! The most amazing fans who have been with us for so long. We want to give some shout outs to you as well. So we’re going to start working through our backlist. So today I want to give a shout out to Paul Tedesco, Grace and George. That’s George Stankow. Thank you—I have no idea how to pronounce your name, I’m so sorry. Thank you guys so much. It means so much that you are still with us and supporting us and helping these shows come up.
I just want to give a quick reminder that I’m going to be at PodFest. That is in Orlando and it starts March 7th through the 9th I think? Something like that.
And finally, rolling it out: There is a show that I would like to bring to everyone’s attention. I have fallen in love with Fate and the Fablemaidens. This is an all-women, family-friendly actual play D&D 5th Edition podcast. It’s been created by these amazing women who I got to meet at PodCon and they are just as lovely in person as they are in the characters they play in their show. And I have to say, it’s become one of my favourites. I love it. So give them a listen at Fate and the Fablemaidens and you can find them at fatefmcast.com. Great live play D&D—love it.
And that’s it for the announcements! Let’s get back to the show.
MIDROLL: THERAP:
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Hello, welcome Eggerton. Please have a seat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, thank you! Thank you. Can I sit here or should I sit—should I sit on your lap?
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
No, no, no, it would be inappropriate, Eggerton, we’ve talked about that. You sit on the sofa.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The sofa.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
And I sit in this very tall authoritarian-like chair.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is it all right if I call it a Chesterfield?
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. I’ll call it a Chesterfield.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Are you going to sit on it?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Okay, let’s sit down. Okay, that’s nice. Velvety.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s very soft.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
So how are things going?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(laughs anxiously)
Oh, well, you know… Blat ran away and Darcy’s drinking all the time and Moira’s trying to maybe, I don’t know, end time herself? And the Shattering might be a nice guy, but then the Shattering kind of does some some evil stuff. And I don’t know, I just feel like, I gotta—
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Wait for me to ask you how you’re feeling.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Right.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
That’s the only job I have here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right. Right. Right. So how are you feeling?
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
(sighs)
So how does all that make you feel, Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, it makes me feel kind of hungry.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Mm hmm. And how’s that been going? The rubber band, is that working or helping?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I kind of broke it. Because I was eating a fairy cake. And I thought maybe I could hold two fairy cakes, like one in each hand, but still be able to use my fingers. So I took the elastic, and I wrapped it around my palm to hold the fairy cake to it. And then when I bit the fairy cake, I bit the elastic and it fell off.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Right. So it’s okay that you’re eating fairy cakes. Are they maybe filling that void deep in your soul that makes you feel so anxious that we’ve talked about?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Well, great! That’s progress.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right, progress! You know what we should do? Celebrates! And I’ve got just a thing. Here have a purple swirly.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Well, you know, I really can’t have those…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, you should, though. I mean, it’s just one…
Their voices fade out, and return a moment later:
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
(completely intoxicated)
Oh, Eggerton! You’re just so amazing. Have I have told you about how nervous I am with people?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(slurring his words slightly)
I don’t think that you’re really nervous? I think—
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Really?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think that you’re just the best. And it’s okay.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
(laughs)
Aw, no! No, I don’t feel like the best, Eggy!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You are the best, though! You know what, there’s so many people on this Discord thingy that keep talking about how amazing you are.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Aw. Oh, but you’re out there saving the world, Eggy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I—I am, I am.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
And just look at those little cheeks!
(laughs)
What was in that cake?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What cake?
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
The fairy cake we ate!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Right, I’m supposed to—I’ve got a note here. I’ve got a sticky note. Uh, yeah, it says—
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Ooo, I’ll put a sticky note on you!
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aw, now I can’t read it! It’s on my forehead. Oh, geez.
(laughs)
Okay, no, wait, okay. You read it.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
I’ll read it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You read it.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Oh! “Help us stay in fairy cakes by going to patreon.com/albasalix”—what’s Alba Salix?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know. But you could probably just go to otherbothers.com if you want to skip all of those weird consonant-vowel pairings.
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
Yeah. Let’s have another one of those cakes.
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right! This is—this is a yellow sprinkled with pink…
SEAN (AS THERAPIST)
(endless giggling)
TIME RESUME:
Eggerton’s voice is still frozen in the middle of “So what I’m saying…” as time resumes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…is, if you come over here and—
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(out of breath)
There you are!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, hi! It’s Lazbo.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Lazbo!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, sorry. Watch the claws.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay. How are you? I haven’t seen you in so long!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Well, I’m very good. Oh, Darcy! It’s good to see you both!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How did you get here?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, I came through the portal. It was really scary.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There was a portal at your tree?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh no. Mother Speckley wants me to bring you both a message. It’s very important.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s nice of her. How’s she doing?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
She’s doing really well, actually. But actually not.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh-oh.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
The tree’s going really dark again. And there’s lightning. Yeah, I don’t want to sugarcoat it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s not good. But you know—
The ominous, throbbing music returns.
SEA:
And the alarms are sounding. Now you hear more alarms; you hear clanging knights running down the hall. You hear sounds of battle and screaming outside the room.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Seems like I got you both at a bad time.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, no, it’s fine! It’s just a busy Tuesday afternoon here.
So tell me about the tree! How is everyone doing? Did that Helen ever get into circle? I always thought that she was going to have a great future.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, yes, Helen is into Circle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Helen got into Circle? That’s lovely to hear.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, but I need to give you the message. I was supposed to give it to you, Darcy.
MARIS:
And I’m just staring blankly this whole time.
SEA:
(laughs)
And there’s screams and shouting and alarms outside the door.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(fragile)
I’m sorry, Lazbo. I think I might have just released the Shattering in the Nexus.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I don’t understand most of that. But I was supposed to bring you. Mother Speckle needs you to come back to the Temple Idries. It’s very important. It’s about Blat—the Chosen One. You might know him as the Chosen One.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat? We haven’t seen him in a—you know, that’s his bed right over there.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(gasps)
No!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Can—can you please show me where the Chosen One sleeps?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, you know what? Lazbo? You should take one of these—this is a Blat shirt.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(gasps)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah! He folds them.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
My name will go down—Helen will no longer be the name of all the Slaad children.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Helen’s the name of all the—what happened?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Not any more! Not when I bring this shirt back! Lazbo will be the name of every sandwich.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s—why are the sandwiches all named Lazbos?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
It’s a long story. But I’m supposed to bring you both back. I came through the portal, but I thought we could leave right away?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Can we go through the portal too?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, the portal is closed. See, no portal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Did you bring any sandwiches?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Um, yes…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Can I try a Lazbo?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, you can try a Helen.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. It sounds kind of gross.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
That’s all I have.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Fine, I’ll take a Helen, I suppose.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, I… I might have released the Shattering. I let the voice in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I don’t know what you’re talking about, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You were frozen, and the voice came in and seemed really self-satisfied that I’d let it in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. We’ll talk about that later—
SEA:
The entire building shakes as this explosion—feels like it just blew out one of the walls of the Academy of the Fallen.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know if this is related… but I think I’ve done something terrible, and I think that Lazbo has to be number 2 on our priority list right now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did you put horseradish on the sandwiches?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no!
MARIS:
And I hold up this apple.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I brought the apple out! I thought this was the place of power the voice was talking about. Eggerton, what are we going to do?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, let’s…
SEA:
Jacklyn’s like,
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Can someone please explain what’s going on…? There’s—there’s like a battle, and what is…
(whispers)
What is the large red thing?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Jacklyn? You’re number 3 on the priority list.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that’s kind of rude, Darcy—
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
You said Jill was number 1.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(panicking)
Nnngh! Number… 1A, how about that?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
(reluctantly)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. What are we going to do? Maybe we need to—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wouldn’t 1a make her number 1? Like, would that not be the first of the first?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know! I don’t know any more!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What if we make Jill 1C… okay? 1A is the sandwich…
SEA:
There’s another explosion. You hear screaming from outside, you hear the sounds of staccato kind of popping sounds, and then you hear thuds of metal hitting the ground—giant suits. It sounds like right outside your door.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I‑I have to go see what’s going on! I have to find out what I’ve done.
MARIS:
And I swing the door open and look out into the hallway.
SEA:
And you see a knight turn, look at you—and then half of the knight is just gone as the head topples and hits the ground, as this blast of dark energy shoots through and knocks out three or four other knights in the hall. And you hear yelling and you see more knights coming out of doorways. And then there’s an explosion in the hall and you see the roof starting to come down on some of those knights.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And I just turn back to Eggerton, and point my arm out into the hallway as if to say You see?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ohhhhhhhh! Yeah, that’s not good.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Okay, team! Here’s the plan! We proceed in cupcake formation…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(small voice)
Oh, no.
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
There is a battle unlike anything you’ve ever felt happening in the halls. And it’s now starting to move down a floor.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! They’re moving away from us! Okay. So what we’ll do is we’re going to go left, to the flank by the river. That’s the thing that we were supposed to do last time. So we’ll do that again. We’ll take, uh, Lazbo, and Jill…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Jacklyn?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Jacklyn. We’ll take Lazbo and Jacklyn and flank left, not right—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! Stop! It’s too late. I think it’s too late.
MARIS:
So the first thing I do is, I do unclasp the apple, so I I detach it.
SEA:
Okay.
MARIS:
I don’t know if that does anything.
SEA:
Nothing seems to happen.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, that didn’t work. Eggerton, I don’t know if there’s anything more we can do here. I don’t know if we can salvage this!
SEA:
So you’re at the end of the dormitory hall. And it sounds like the battle is now moving. And you see a few knights now, running in formation past your door and down the stairs down towards the second floor.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We should try and find Moira.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(firmly)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Moira will know what to do.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Unless she’s the reason this is happening.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Very possibly. But I might be reason this is happening.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, don’t say that about yourself. I think if you think positively, you’ll see that, you know, you lead with good intentions. And—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, okay. You can make me feel better later.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Okay, let’s go.
MARIS:
And I shut the door on Lazbo and Jacklyn. And I grab Eggerton and we start running down the stairs towards the main floor.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Oh, so you’re leaving them in the room?
MARIS:
Yes.
SEA:
Okay… Cool.
MIK:
(snickers quietly)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s an interesting choice you made tactically!
SEA:
(laughing)
Okay, so Darcy slams the door, and you just see a wide eyed Jacklyn staring at this very large frog-like humanoid with claws for hands.
And the two of you are in a hallway. It smells of acid and smoke and death and rotting flesh and this strange ozone smell. And the roof is caved in behind you. There are bodies twitching on the ground, still half in armour, half not… and it’s just utter destruction. There must be a hundred knights that are dead or dying in this hall.
And you see the stairway in the distance going down, and of course it goes up to the roof. And you hear more explosions. The whole building shakes under your feet and dust rains down on you from the floor below you as the battle continues.
And alarms stop, but they don’t stop suddenly; they just sort of do that slow dying as if they’re just running out of power, as you hear more explosions and more shouting and screaming from the second floor.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let’s keep moving. Let’s keep moving! We just have to find Moira. We just have to find Moira.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, if I were Moira, where would I be?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I really hope we are on the bad side. This is the only way this is any good.
MARIS:
Okay, so we run to Moira’s office.
SEA:
Moira’s office is on the first floor. You’re on the third floor.
MARIS:
We’re running down!
SEA:
Okay. So you start coming down the stairs, and you just run into a wall of knights that are now backing up, like, backwards into you. And they are throwing spears down in front and then you just see a wave of five of them just become disintegrated, just disintegrated to dust as this blackness strikes them. And there’s only now about twenty in front of you. They’re all trying to retreat and back up, pushing into you. You see another three go into dust in front of you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Run back up! Run back up!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Wait, no! We know the black thing, it’s okay!
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger, both of you. You can use Dex or Strength, depending on how you sell it, but tell me what you’re doing.
MIK:
Can I use Charisma?
SEA:
Tell me what you’re doing before you roll, to get out of the way of this—it’s now getting closer and closer to you.
MARIS:
Okay, well, I’ve turned around and I’m shoving Eggerton back up the stairs we just came down.
SEA:
Okay, so Strength.
MARIS:
Oh darn.
(laughs)
MIK:
And I’m trying to like, swim past her arms towards it! ‘Cause we met that thing.
SEA:
Okay, so first, Marisa, you’re gonna roll.
MARIS:
Okay. That’s an 8…
SEA:
Plus 0. Okay, so partial success. All right. And Eggerton, you’re trying to fight her?
MIK:
Yeah, I’m trying to get past. I have a 7.
SEA:
With a partial success.
Okay, so basically you guys are sort of stuck in position. You’re half-shoving; he’s trying to get under you. Another row of three knights disappear. There were only six knights standing and they are pushing against you. And a couple of them turn and run, like, leave you. And now there’s like five knights between you, and then another three disintegrate. What do you both do?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, the knights can’t take this! We have to get out of here! Come, up the stairs. Up the stairs! We’ll go through the portal!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay! Okay! Ow! Stop pulling at my ear!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So we head up the stairs.
SEA:
Okay, now to your left, as you hit the top of the stairs, is the little secret doors that lead to the Hall of Doorways. To your right is the room within which you have left your two friends… and the blackness is coming up the stairs. Another three knights drop. There’s only two left.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We have to go save Jacklyn and Lazbo! Quick! Back to the room, back to the room, back to the room!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay, okay!
MARIS:
Okay, so we burst through into the room again, that we just left.
SEA:
Okay, you burst into the door, and you see Jacklyn and Lazbo just sort of staring at each other, each sort of awkwardly staring at each other, and they both look really relieved when you burst in.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uhhh…! Badness! Badness! Lots of badness!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(stammering)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Lazbo, will the portal work? Can we get through the portal?!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Maybe? I don’t know! I’m just supposed to take you. Oh wait, I have a device!
SEA:
And he tries—and he fumbles it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Nnnngh!
SEA:
So I need you guys to roll Defy Danger to see if you can catch the device. You see it leave his hand, his claws and start to go towards the ground, and it looks like it’s made of glass.
MIK:
I rolled a 3.
MARIS:
(laughs)
We’re all going to die.
This is Dex, then? Come on, 12!
Oh! It’s an 11.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
So tell me how you catch this glass bauble that’s slipped out of his claws.
MARIS:
I dive from the doorway onto my stomach, and I go sliding across the floor and my hand just catches it as it falls into it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Got it!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, thank God, I almost dropped it!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, you did!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Uh… quick! Quick, use it, use it!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How do I use it?!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, throw it on the ground.
Waves of pent-up laughter.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay!
MARIS:
So I just throw it onto the ground in front of me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, time to go! Let’s go.
SEA:
And this black portal starts to form in the air, right where you drop it, and it starts to form, bubbling out and bubbling in, and you sort of see what might be a tree? But it’s sort of having trouble… and you hear another explosion shake the building.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Through the portal! Through the portal!
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
(breathless)
Are you sure?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Jacklyn! Look, look there’s Jill, in the portal! Quick!
SEA:
Jacklyn is through the portal. Jacklyn just leaps headfirst through the portal.
MARIS:
We’re all through the portal.
SEA:
Okay.
They step through with a whoosh.
THE TEMPL:
The sound of wind and torrential rain.
SEA:
Your senses start to come back in and you realize you are face-down in muck. Eggerton, your head is under someone’s leg. You’re having trouble breathing in the water and the muck. There’s a wind and a rain that is just tearing at you. It’s like a hurricane. And you hear lightning striking. And it’s very disorienting because it’s so dark. And Lazbo’s like,
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Someone’s—someone’s on my—I don’t want to say what it is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(unintelligible gurgling)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasping for breath)
Ohh, we made it. We made it!
(to Eggerton)
Get—off me! Ugh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, there we go. Well, I think you were kind of on me, but you know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, you were definitely on me. Ugh… Jacklyn? Jacklyn, are you all right?
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Yeah, I’m okay. My bucket! Oh, here’s my bucket.
SEA:
And you are on the path—a path that you were on before. You see a fallen, very large tree limb that is now covered in some kind of growth. In the darkness, it’s hard to make out, but there does appear to be a very large black form ahead of you that might be what was Temple Idries, or what’s left of it.
And lightning strikes suddenly and lights it all up, and you see that the path that was all manicured when Blat last saw it—I don’t think you guys saw it that way—is now flooded and there’s mud everywhere. And you see the tree in the distance with the doors closed.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This place has really gone downhill. Lazbo? Lazbo, what happened to the investments that you were discussing about upkeep and janitorial services?
SEA:
Lazbo stands up and is almost blown a few feet to the side by the gusts of wind. And the rain is coming sideways, like it hurts as it strikes your faces.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
There’s been a small problem with the weather since the Chosen One… well, you’ll see! Mother Speckley wants you right away! Come!
SEA:
He starts hunching down against the wind and moving forward down the path towards the door.
MARIS:
And I follow him and grab Jacklyn’s hand and pull them through the weather.
SEA:
Eggerton, the water is up to your thighs.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um, now, I’m not afraid of the water per se. But there are many things in the water that could potentially try and consume me. And I’d prefer if they not. So Darcy, do you think maybe it’d be okay if just this one time, I kind of got to piggyback?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, fine. Come on. Get up.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Awesome. Here we go.
He climbs up on Darcy, with much grunting from both of them.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There we go. Okay, onward!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Here, do you want me to steer? Are you okay to—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I’m fine.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But I can just give you a little, like—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(icy)
Just be quiet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m being quiet!
(whispers)
Okay, so what I’ll do is I’ll give you a little [nudge] in the side and you’ll go faster.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrrgh!
MARIS:
And I start trotting along just so I can get him off quickly.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There you go. Okay,
SEA:
We cut to inside the Temple Idries. The door is slammed shut by three Slaad. And you guys are drenched. Everyone is just—there’s water everywhere. It’s like you went swimming.
And you see that inside, there’s lamps lit, and aside from the lightning striking up and the rain that’s working through the repairs and the top of the tree, you see that it’s relatively orderly. You see a young woman with white skin and dark hair coming forward with her hood up.
SEAN (AS THE YOUNG WOMAN)
Welcome. Welcome. How may I—oh, Lazbo!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yes, I brought them right away for Mother Speckley!
SEAN (AS THE YOUNG WOMAN)
I see. And you are…?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m Darcy.
SEAN (AS THE YOUNG WOMAN)
Ah, Darcy. Welcome. Please, come, come, let us get you a change of clothes. And you must be…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m General Eggerton. I lead this troop and I am here to receive word from Mother Speckley about the status of our friend Blat…
SEAN (AS THE YOUNG WOMAN)
Yes, Lazbo will get you some dry clothes. And this is…?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Jacklyn.
SEAN (AS THE YOUNG WOMAN)
Right. So, you two come with me and we’ll get you into dry clothes and in to see Speckley right away.
Eggerton is still babbling in the background.
MARIS:
And I drop Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…and he will save the world and we will go forward together and—ooofa!
SEA:
We cut to the three of you in white robes. You are being led back into the main hall where the dais was that a certain individual got trapped under, Darcy.
And you see another person in a white robe, rather young, fit with frizzled, light-coloured hair. And she has, when she turns, this hawk nose, but it’s the eyes that capture you. They belie this intensity, because they hold your gaze for a millisecond, but then they dance over your entire form, as if cataloguing all about you.
And the priestess who was leading you up turns and returns to her duties. And Lazbo is no longer here so I don’t have to do the voice.
MARIS:
And at this point, I’m just pacing back and forth frantically, just completely outside myself.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
My robe’s a bit long. Does anyone happen to have like, a sewing kit? ‘Cause I’m dragging it and I feel like I’m going to not only just sort of like make a lot of mess on the actual robe itself—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay! Someone has to tell us why we’re here, because I might have just destroyed the place we came from and I don’t really have time for this. So why are we here? What’s going on? Who are you?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Oh, I’m Mother Speckey. You must be Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I am.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
And you seem very upset, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(frantic)
Yes, I I might have invited the Shattering into the Academy of the Fallen—I mean, it might really be fallen, like really fallen right now. And I don’t know what we’re doing here and—and I just don’t know. You should talk to General Eggerton right now.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
No, I understand a hundred percent.
SEA:
And she makes a gesture and the dais starts to pull back, and you see a few Slaad pushing it back. She goes,
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
We won’t tell it all, Darcy. Come.
SEA:
And she just starts going down the stairs, down the hall.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Isn’t that where, you know, that thing happened to you that time…?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t like it down there. Do we have to go down there?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m afraid so.
SEA:
She’s now halfway down the stairs.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This time, maybe just stay calm, because the last time with the spiky things was kind of gross and you made everyone uncomfortable—
SEA:
She stops.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
If you wish, we could stop and talk, but I am attempting—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Fine. Okay, we’re going.
MARIS:
And I follow her.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Come along, Jacklyn.
SEAN (AS JACKLYN)
Okay.
SEA:
So Mother Speckley leads you down the hall, past where your event happened, to the very end to a round circular room that is in the heart of the tree. And she stops at the doorway.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
If you’d please all remove your footwear.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I kind of like wearing shoes. I’ve—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Remove. Them. Now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But I just—I’ve got a toenail thing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Take them off. Take them off.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, just don’t look. Don’t look. Everyone just—
MARIS:
And so I take my shoes off.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Or if we wish, Eggerton, we could talk about your refusal to deal with your real emotions.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I—
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Or you could just take your shoes off.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…I’ll take off my shoes.
Do you have anything to eat?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Yes, after. Come.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs)
SEA:
And she steps forward, and you see a circle that at the centre of the room, and the moonlight from above is hitting it, even though there’s a storm outside. And it at first looks like it’s made out of granite. But then it sort of glitches—you see it just like distort and it’s almost like you saw something, like a darkness, a figure with wings. And then it goes back to marble.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
(sighs)
I’m not sure how much I can or should tell you. But something is wrong. very wrong. And our primary mission is to support the Chosen One. This has been happening for some time. If you’ll just stand here a moment…
SEA:
And it glitches again, and you see destruction and there’s screams, but it’s different.
Crude, ominous heavy metal music plays.
SEA:
And you see a very familiar looking profile of Blat—and then it’s gone.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That was a picture of Blat! Did you see that?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. What—what’s going on with Blat? What’s happening?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
These aren’t pictures. These are what is happening. Right now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What—what is happening? Is he okay?
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Blat may have… Blat may have done more than just upset one goddess.
Oh boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That checks out.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yep.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m worried.
SEA:
And then the pool goes clear. And what do we see, Carter?
CARTE:
Blat, surrounded by darkness, flying up out of the forest that surrounds the tree, looking determined.
SEA:
And beneath Blat, as he leaves the frame… you see a village on fire.

"20: The Meeting of the Three",""
"21: Ice Ice Baby","THE RUIN:
SEA:
We open on the moors: the mist and the rolling hills, and the remains of a castle. And as we come down, we see a figure standing in the centre of the ruins. There is very little left of this castle; the moss has become part of the stone, and the air smells of musty dirt and decay, as if this castle has not stood for a thousand years. And yet Blat can see the outline of where the great hall once was. And he can see the outline of the base of what was once the tower that led up to Celene’s chamber. But there is nothing else.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in his gruff, grim Blathoxil voice)
What. I don’t under… what’s happening? Why is there nothing here? Why does everything looks so old? There should be… fairies and bricks that walk like people. It’s only been a few months since I was here last. I don’t understand.
SEA:
You hear the sound of something moving, somewhere beneath, very faint. And you do see what remains of the stairs that led down to the basement.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There we are. Nice try, Celene. You thought this would trick me? You just moved downstairs.
CARTE:
And Blat takes the stairs down.
SEA:
And something explodes outwards. And bats swarm past you screaming out into the growing dusk. And ahead of you the stairs hit a dead end.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So… bats.
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
We are suddenly in a chamber made of ice. It gleams, and reflections bounce off every surface, for everything is made of ice. And it is a large, oval chamber, mostly empty except in the centre—staring into a bowl that’s lifted off the ground by a narrow stem, a bowl of ice—is Celene.
And beside her is a shadowy figure that keeps transforming: coalescing and and recoalescing into different forms—a woman, an imp—constantly changing and somewhat ephemeral, like you could see through them.
And in the bowl, as we get closer, we see that Celene is watching someone that is emerging from the basement of what was once her castle.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes, yes, Justine! He has taken the bait.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
(hushed, but eager)
Yes, your plan! Your plan seems to be coming together. I think, I think.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
No thinking! This plan must work, Justine.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes. No thinking, no thinking, Your Eminence. Of course. Of course.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
He believes he will defeat me, he and that… what’s left of that goddess in him.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
No, there will be no defeat. There is never defeat for Celene, not as long as I am here, no, no, no, no, no.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Let us hope that is the case.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Of course. Of course, Your Eminence. How could it not be? I can be anything, anyone. How could anyone conquer me? Because I am never here to be conquered long enough.
(laughs)
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(grim)
And you will not live a day past my demise.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes. Yes, Your Eminence.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Now. He’s searching for me. He must find me, Justine.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, I will guide him. I will bring him to you. Yes, that is what you wish, yes?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes, you will bring him here to the white palace. And the broken goddess inside him. The goddess who no longer has her source of power.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
No. No power can never conquer yours. I will do your bidding. I will go as quickly as smoke, like wists—
SEAN (AS CELENE)
No. You must make him believe he is finding us. Do you understand, Justine?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, yes, Your Eminence, I do, I do.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
It must be difficult or he will not want it.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
It shall be done.

DEPARTING THE TEMPL:
SEA:
We return to the Temple Idries: the giant tree rising out of the forest. It’s daylight. Birds sing and move about. The storms have cleared.
The tree has seen better days. But flowers grow and Slaad move around the grounds. And inside the tree, in the main chamber, we find Eggerton and Darcy packing their bags to head out.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So do you have room in your bag for this mustard?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because it looks like you don’t really have much in your bag yet. And as you can see my bag’s already pretty full—you know, jars of—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You have three varieties of mustard already in your bag. Why do you need that one too?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, well, this one has sprinkles.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It doesn’t matter. We’re not going to win this with mustard. Leave the sprinkle mustard behind!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um, that is a very interesting insight and I’ll take it into consideration, Lieutenant Darcy. But I think it’s very important that from a general point of view, we take all the mustards we might think we might need.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think you might need to prioritize. So why don’t you take out the sparkle mustard if you want the sprinkle mustard?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because they are clearly for separate occasions! I mean, how foolish would it look if I were to walk up to someone and say, “Here’s sprinkles!” and they’re like “Oh, I wanted sparkles.”
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Well, what about this one? What about the stripy mustard? Surely the stripy mustard can go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but you need that because if you’re wearing dots, you need to have stripy mustard—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I give up! I give up. This is not important right now. We have to get going!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I bought you the Lazbos. Three each.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, thank you so much! These are delicious sandwiches.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, thank you. Yes. Thank you very much. They look great.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mm hmm. And—ah! No horseradish. Good job, Lazbo.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
You’re welcome. I did put extra mustard though.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent. Which kind of mustard?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Just mustard.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What.. what do you mean “just mustard”?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Just the yellow stuff.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? What? Why is your mustard yellow?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I don’t know. Is your mustard not yellow?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Some of it has yellow polka dots in it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Eggerton, sit down for a minute.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There’s just plain mustard in the world. Nothing else. It’s just plain yellow mustard?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(stammering)
What—what…?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Well, we’re still pretty proud of it, I want to say.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, it’s fine. It’s fine, Lazbo. You’re good.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But… what… I… what?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So! I guess this is goodbye.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, very well. Oh, Mother Speckley is coming. I’ll go tell her you’re leaving.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. Yeah, we need to hurry. So if you could bring her quickly.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay. I’ll go get her. Oh, also I forgot to give you the napkins.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thanks.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy, you’re probably gonna need these.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(deadpan)
Yes, I’m sure I will. Yeah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ll take most of them.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. You’ll be the napkin holder.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s fine.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
(aside, to Lazbo, as she enters)
Yes. Very well. Right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Oh, Darcy. Eggerton. Is there anything I can do at the last minute? Anything I can…?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve gotsome questions about this yellow mustard.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, we have no questions about mustard. It’s fine. The mustard is all good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs)
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Great. I wish there was more I could do. I’m sorry that my plan did not work.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, it kind of worked. I mean, Blat did come down and we did hug him. I feel like the power of, uh… oh, what’s her name again?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Loxsyn?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, the other one.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey. No. We don’t say that word.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Thank you, Darcy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, Celene. Celene.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, that one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think the power of Celene might be might be too much for him, though.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m afraid it might be as well… I wish there was more I could do.
I do have one of these baubles—do you know how to use it?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, yeah, I think I remember.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Just smash it on the ground.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, one of those baubles. Yes.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
Right. It will open a portal back to here, should that be useful.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excellent. So, General Eggerton, what what was your plan again for getting Blat back?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right, we’re… we’re going to continue the Hug It Out plan. This is Hug It Out version 2.0. This time, we’re going to hug him hard… and that will make the difference.
(starts to laugh)
This time, for reasons… that the Slaad that have just entered the room will now espouse.
Silence.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Uh… The Super Hug!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(laughing)
Yes, the Super Hug! I’ve got diagrams here, flowcharts…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Hey, wait, let’s show the alternative Super Hug 7A. We’ve been working on it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, ready? One! Two! Three!
They hug, straining loudly.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(over their groans)
So let me get this straight. We’re travelling to Celene’s—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t breathe! It’s too much!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I can’t hear you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasping)
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh! Abort, everyone, abort!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(out of breath)
Okay, so we need to do that again. This is why we train.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I know, sorry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So these mistakes don’t happen out there in the field when lives are on the line.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yes, sir.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Alright.
(exhales)
Whoo, okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So we’re travelling to Celene’s castle to hug Blat. Is that the plan?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
SEA:
(laughs)
A NEW ARRIVA:
SEA:
We’re over a village, pre-dawn. And in the early morning light, we see a group gathered outside a house, and on the door is painted the symbol of Celene, the moon.
The crowd outside appears uneasy, but trying to be supportive of one individual who keeps looking towards the house. And inside we hear the cries of a woman in labour. And the man steps forward, but is grabbed by the group and pulled back. And they are handing around glasses of a steaming liquid. And on the outskirts of this, in the shadows across the street, we see a figure watching.
Silence.
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
(gruff voice)
I hope Stephanie’s doing okay in there.
Laughter.
MARIS:
(laughing, whispers)
You’re not the figure!
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
It’s okay—you shouldn’t go in there. The midwife’s in there. She’ll be fine.
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
Yeah, yeah, ’cause screaming’s always fine.
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
Well, it does happen in labour. Celene will watch over the baby.
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
Well, I hope so.
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
I’m sure the baby will be healthy.
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
I mean, we sacrificed the first two to Celene so this one would be okay.
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
You… you what?
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
Well, that’s what we do, is, you have two babies. You sacrifice them, the third one works out fine.
MARISA (AS ANOTHER VILLAGER)
No, I sacrificed my first five.
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
Oh, well I guess if you’re if you’re really pious like that, but not all of us can afford five—
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
You only sacrificed five?
MARISA (AS ANOTHER VILLAGER)
Yes, well… I thought that was enough.
MIKE (AS YET ANOTHER VILLAGER)
We sacrificed six!
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
(inexplicably Irish accent)
All right, everyone. All right. So I’ve tried to do the official census now. So we’re up one—so that’s in the plus column, but you say you sacrificed three of your children?
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
That’s right. That’s right.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
So now we’re negative three—so really, that’s just negative two…
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
Negative seven.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Negative seven.
MARISA (AS ANOTHER VILLAGER)
Five, remember, five.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
You’re at negative five…
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
Oh, but I did have Roger, that’s a plus one.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Oh that’s a plus one, so really the last one’s a negative four. All right, so from what I can tell, everyone in the village is just outside of this house right now because we’re no longer propagating.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I guess if you put it that way, yeah. But I mean, there are the raccoon families.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Well, the raccoons aren’t capable of voting, so I don’t believe we can count them as true citizens.
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
Well! I’m offended by that. Raccoons have just as much right to vote.
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
Roberto! The door’s opening!
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
(gasps)
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
It’s your child!
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
My child’s walking?!
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
Well—no, your child’s being carried by the midwife, Roberto!
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
Oh, that makes more sense.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
All right, so that’s officially a plus one then. We’re keeping this one and not sacrificing. Very good, very good.
Shouts of jubilation from the crowd.
MIKE (AS EXPECTANT FATHER)
Wonderful, wonderful.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
I’ll change the side outside of town then. All right, very good.
SEAN (AS FEMALE VILLAGER)
Cheers!
SEA:
And as we pull back… on the top of a building across the street, we see a figure with wings tucked against his body, watching this whole scene play out. And unbeknownst to Blat, out of the darkness, tendrils of blackness are creeping and merging together into a female form, but six paces behind him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I thought maybe Celene might show up in one of these places that agreed to worship her. But still no sign. Why did these idiots decide to follow Celene? I couldn’t get anyone to worship the moon. Why are these people moonites?
THE PALAC:
SEA:
We cut back to the ice palace. And Celene is pacing so rapidly the ice on the floor is growing slick and glistening in the light. And she is shouting:
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Justine! Jinn!
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, Yes, Your Majesty. Your Eminence. Yes, here I am!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes, there you are. Why have you not spoken to him?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I… I was following him! I was watching what he did. I wondered if he might find his way here on his own.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Let me be really clear, Justine!
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes?
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Before I drink your soul.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
(inhales sharply)
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You must play the game. He believes he is in control. You must set up a challenge for him. You must taunt him. Do you understand?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I think—I think so, Your Majesty. But—but you do want him to come here. You want to face him? Yes? Yes?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes. Here to the labyrinth.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
The labyrinth. Yes. I will I will bring him to the labyrinth. I will go now and bring him to the labyrinth!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I understand.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You’d better.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I will find him in the next village. In the next village, I will find him!
ON THE TRAI:
SEA:
We hear the sound that comes with the heat right at the peak of midday. When the sun is burning so hot and the canteens are running low, and the forest seems unending in every direction, and the path just keeps meandering… and Darcy is leading as Eggerton follows behind.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, but this time I actually have something in my shoe.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, you always have something in your shoe.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, they just didn’t make them wide enough for my feet. And things, you know, end up getting in and they hurt and… let’s hold the party for a second while I sit down and…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait. Wait. Eggerton—did you put the mustard in your shoe? Because it wouldn’t fit in your satchel? Is that where you put it?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I just—I need to have the selection, just in case.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because it is very uncouth to show up without appropriate condiments.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s also uncouth not be able to walk. That’s why you’re sore. Take the mustard out of your shoe!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs)
Okay. Well, it’s a little warm now anyway.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why don’t you just leave it here on the side of the road.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’m not gonna litter. That’s rude.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, do you realize we’re going to possibly face the goddess of the moon to save our friend Blat? And he’s possibly gone all evil so he might kill us all anyway, Do you realize that there’s more important things going on than mustard?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but not more important than littering.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, so what solution do you propose?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’m still pretty sure you’ve got like, two things in your bag.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Very good.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
If this will end this, give me the mustard.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Here you go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right.
MARIS:
And I take the mustard and I place it in my bag.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent! Shoe back on… and party forward!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. Forward. How long do you think this is going to take?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, according to my calculations… when we divide the Y axis by the longitude of the latitude—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Never mind. We’ll just keep walking.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
If only we had a Gnomish Place…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Finder?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Seeker.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re right, Seeker. Good. Good. Yep. All right. Let’s just keep going.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Ah, you’re coming into the village now, are ya? It looks like I’ll have to change the sign. Are you permanent residents or just visiting?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, that depends. What kind of restaurants do you have here?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Well, we have one.
Silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, we’re not permanent residents.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
All right, just visitors then.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
So just underneath the large number here, I’ll just put in brackets “+ possible 2”. There you are then!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I feel like we—we are two. That’s not a possible,that’s—
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
But you said you weren’t interested in being a permanent resident. You’re just visiting then. So I’ve just put this here, just in case you might be changing your mind then.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, that’s positive thinking. I like that.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
No, you’ll like our one restaurant. It’s only one but it serves food.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ah! Well, I do like restaurants that serve food.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Ah! then you’re in luck then.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What kind of foods do they serve?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Well, there’s hot…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yep.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
And then there’s cold.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay? Okay.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
But in the middle, you have tepid.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve always liked tepid.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Ah, yes. You don’t burn yourself, nor is it too crunchy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mm hmm. Because when things get cold, they get crunchy.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Exactly! Like ice. Which we also be having in our village.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
SEAN (AS A VILLAGER)
Excuse me. Sorry—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, hello!
SEAN (AS A VILLAGER)
(laughs nervously)
Hi. Don’t mind me, just—sorry, Peter.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Are you leavin’ then?
SEAN (AS A VILLAGER)
We are.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Awww.
SEAN (AS A VILLAGER)
I’m so sorry. I can’t—
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
I’m running out of paint, Gladys!
SEAN (AS GLADYS)
I know. I just—I can’t do it again. I can’t sacrifice another child. I’m so sorry.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Oh, I’m sorry that the one rule of our village is against your morals. “I don’t want to to be sacrificing any of my children to the Goddess of the Moon.”
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What? What? What did you say?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(stammering)
Did—what? You said s‑sacrifice?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You said Goddess of the Moon?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Oh, yes. Celene, Goddess of the Moon. We all worship her here in this village.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you see her? Is she ever around here?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Well, you know what the moon is, do you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. We know what the moon is. But what about the actual embodiment of the moon, Celene? Does she come here?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Well, some believe that Celene watches everything that we do and judges us on whether we’re good and bad.
SEAN (AS GLADYS)
(suddenly nervous)
Uh, I mean, I’m just… heading out to go into the forest… shopping.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Oh! Good. Winky-wink-wink. That’s right. Not really moving out permanent like.
SEAN (AS GLADYS)
Oh, no! No, no.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
All right, so I’ll just alter the sign here to say “Possibly 3”—
SEAN (AS GLADYS)
Definitely!
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Oh. “Definitely 3 coming back”. All right! Off you go then. Good luck with your shopping.
SEAN (AS GLADYS)
Thank you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So this is an interesting town. Um… Our…
(he stammers and draws a blank)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
He’s very hungry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I am so hungry. It was half an hour since we stopped for our last snack.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Really. Because you reek of mustard.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, there’s a funny story about that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s not that funny.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So. There we were getting ready for an adventure—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So, excuse me—you need to tell us more about your goddess. Do you have ceremonies where you summon her here? Have you seen a winged demon-type creature around here?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Oh, that’s ridiculous question there, isn’t it? “Winged demons.” Demons! Just flying about, visiting people, getting involved in adventures. Ha ha! Pull the other one then, young lady.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But you sacrifice your children to a goddess you never see.
Silence.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Well, yes, that tracks. It’s our religion, you see. We’ll not be worshipping demons, young lady!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That would be a little weird if they were worshipping demons.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Thank you. You see? Finally, someone that talks good sense.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So you’ve seen no strange creature, that made you feel a little scared? Who talks in a really gravelly voice?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Oh, well now, our local schoolteacher is a very large man and he does have a bit of a speech impediment.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is he red?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Only when he drinks.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I don’t think we’re going to get much more out of this.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, if you were to want to, perhaps pay homage to Celene in person… would she have a, I don’t know, lair nearby somewhere? Like a castle?
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Well, I don’t know if our village would be the one to be asking that question. Now there is a village just a little wee ways down the road—they also worship Celene. But they also, rumour has it, have a wee spot where the Celene powers are, well, emanating from. If you believe that sort of thing. Also, they have two restaurants!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay! Party forward.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right, let’s go.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
All right. So you’re just continuing on, then? You’re not stopping at all? Because I’ll just have to alter the sign again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, we can send back some paint for you.
CARTER (AS CENSUS TAKER)
Oh! Excellent. Then I can start from scratch!
All right. So who lives in house number 1? That would be Aaron Abrams and his wife Betty, and they sacrificed five children…
His voice fades out.
MIDROL:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey, everyone, Sean here, and a few announcements are going to get you right back into the storey because man, we were having fun with the format on this one, just totally rolling by the seat of our pants, a lot of changeups. I loved how everyone was playing different characters. Super fun, hoping to do that again.
Okay, first of all, just a reminder about the Reckless Play Guild on Facebook. It’s an open group, you are encouraged to come and hang with us. There are four shows and they’re all amazing live-plays, we’ve got Dark Dice, Dumbgeons and Dragons, and The Lucky Die. And us all in there. And it’s a super fun time. So check that out. You can search for the Reckless Play Guild on Facebook.
And now it’s time to call out some awesome new peeps! And man, we got a lot of new supporters this last two weeks, stepping up and joining our Patreon, and we just can never thank you enough. But what we can do is thank you on the air! And that’s what I’m going to do now.
So big thanks to Joseph Fox. Jack McNamee—I hope I pronounce all these right—Tracy Thompson, Saad Hussain, Nathan Howe, Alicia Hall, Jack Pevyhouse, Rob Wilson and Elise Dukart. And now, roll of drums… roll the drums—I’m doing really good with my English today—for some of our amazing old-timers. And this is a special group of three names I’m gonna read off. These people have been with us for a very long time.
First, I have Aaron Lane. Thank you so much, Aaron. Next, I have Karim Kronfli. You may know this gentleman because he’s been in our show. And he’s an amazing actor, voice actor, just all around great person. And man can he play dark characters.
And you might have heard of this third name: Michael Howie. He’s been a Patreon supporter of us, even before we started End of Time and Other Bothers and we can’t thank him enough for that and for being a great friend. And thank you all for being great friends and for spreading the word about this show.
And now I got some bad news. It’s not my fault, I swear! Okay, it’s totally my fault. There’s going to be a short break after Episode 22. The table’s back together, we’re recording, but we sort of missed a couple of weeks. And so we’re going to be regrouping, getting some more episodes under our belt and then relaunching with Episode 23.
So follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Discord. We’ll be putting announcements out when we know our new launch date. But that said, you still have an episode and a half left before the break! Anyways, thanks all so much. Let’s get you back to the show.
MIDROLL: THE CAFÉ
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton, I was very clear about this. I don’t just want this place to be about desserts. We need more than just fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We need sandwiches, we need some snacking. We need veggies, we need plates of veggies.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What are veggies?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Vegetables.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That grow out of the ground.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, you know you can actually if you if you put those in water and soak them for a while, then you cook them up, they can actually make a really nice creamy topping to a fairy cake!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. No more fairy cakes. Look! You have 400 fairy cakes!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, That’s exactly how many fairy cakes I need.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Not everyone wants… Blat. Blat, how are you doing with the drinks? We got to get the drinks going.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I knew that he was going to have a little bit of pushback against the whole protein thing. So I’m adding it to the drinks!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Tea with protein! Coffee with protein! Soda with protein! It’s actually not bad.
(tastes some and smacks his lips)
No, I’m wrong. It’s actually pretty terrible.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You know, I’m the only one with experience in this sort of entrepreneurial business. Why don’t any of you listen to me?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Didn’t you work for like, a big government office building with a cafeteria?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, okay, you’re right, I don’t mean entrepreneurial, I mean experience in a cafeteria, right? That was me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’ve got the kitchen at the Nexus, and my fairy pouch…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think that really went well.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
(over an intercom)
Is this thing on? Hello! Drive-through! Hello!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, yes, yes. Can we help you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Yes! I would like three coffees. extra hot, extra protein. One skim protein. And hold the foam on the second.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait—where did that menu come from? Blat, you put up the protein menu without asking me?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, we sell it. Why can’t we have the menu up?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
Fine. Just get these drinks ready. Snegal will take anything that you give him.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Did you ask him if he wants fairy cakes?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I did not.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How many fairy cakes?
(shouts)
Snegal! Can you hear me?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Hello? Yes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay! Do you want any fairy cakes?
A long silence.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent! I will get 200 prepared for you.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right. Well, that’ll be 50 sovereigns, then.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Well, when you said you wanted me to be the first customer, I didn’t know I had to have money. I thought it was just gonna, you know, say what I wanted. It was like a game.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But that’s how we run our business… through money. That helps us to buy all the ingredients and supplies.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. So here’s what we’re going to do. I’m just going to write down here that you owe me 50 sovereigns.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay, yes!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And I’m gonna write down otherbothers.com Okay, okay. And you’re just going to go there and when you have your 50 sovereigns you can make sure that you note that down and you bring them back to me, okay?
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, I bet though, he could go to that otherbothers dot thingy that you talked about? And he could probably, I don’t know, like be a patron of the cafeteria or something. That would be cool.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That would be an excellent idea. That’s a good idea, Eggerton.
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Oh! Can I hear Blat talk like Blatman if I do that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. For—you know what? a month, Blatman will come to your funeral.
Silence.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEAN (AS SNEGAL)
Okay! I’m gonna sign up right now! Bye everyone!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
His funeral?! Then how will he know if I’m actually there?
Music sting.
LESSON:
SEA:
We’re standing on a parapet in a slightly larger town. And the parapet is attached to a gothic building that appears to be some kind of school or library or monastery or study. And on the cobblestones beneath we see some hooded figures running. And we see flashes of smiles, and we catch whispers. And the hooded figure is watching as they all move into a room lit by torches.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
(Russian accent)
Yes, children, come in. Come in. It’s time for lessons.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Oh, yes. Sorry, father.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
(quickly drops the accent)
You’re all wearing your hoods up again? I thought we talked about this in last week’s class on fashion.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Yes, Father, we’ll take them down. We just… we just like them up.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
I’ve messed my hair up.
SEA:
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Now, now, now. That’s not what the Goddess of the Moon teaches us. The Goddess of the Moon teaches us that looks are more important than anything else.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
(laughing)
He doesn’t have any hair.
The students laugh.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Hey, hey, I shaved my head by choice.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Mm hmm.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
To show solidarity with the moon.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Mm hmm, mm hmm.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Who is representative of our goddess, Celene.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Not a sign of stubble, but sure, we believe you.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Okay, now the both of you together are going to recite the prayer to Celene.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
(whines)
Ohhh…
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
That’s what you get when you make fun of the teacher.
The students groan.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
So together. Same time.
(laughing, out of character)
I want to hear the rhyming prayer to Celene from the two of you. Same time, no mistakes.
Laughter.
SEAN AND CARTER (AS THE STUDENTS)
(singing)
Oh Celene…
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
You are the moon—
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
(simultaneously)
You are the best—
SEAN AND CARTER (AS THE STUDENTS)
(struggling to get in sync again)
—best, best moon, best Moon Goddess.
Silence.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
And the second verse!
SEAN AND CARTER (AS THE STUDENTS)
(singing)
Oh Celene… you are the greatest Moon Goddess.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
And forevermore.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Amen.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Okay, okay. You’ve been practicing, I can see that, and I appreciate the effort. Now take your seats while we prepare for today’s lesson on… taxes!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Oh, I hate tax class…
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Everyone hates tax class until it’s time to collect taxes and then they go, “I wish someone had taught me how to do this when I was in school, and now I’m an adult and I don’t know what I’m doing…”
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Professor? Professor?
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Yes?
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
I just get really confused on how we divide the babies and the children by trimester on tax. I just… it really confuses me.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Well… you divide by three.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Right.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Trimester. Three.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Yeah, I know. But then, if it’s two babies and it’s tax season in May…?
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Well, that really depends on the height of the grass outside of the parapet.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Right. Right.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
If it has extended beyond the first stone, then it’s an integer of 4.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Right.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
If it is below the first stone, it is the circumference of the moon when it is waxing in retrograde.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
(groans)
I’m never going to get this.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
You see, now, I heard a rumour that when we collect all the babies and we stick them in the field for a Celene to collect, that Celene doesn’t collect them, and the babies just crawl away and eventually get raised by wolves.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
That’s just a rumour. Now go back to using your baby bone pencils and take down the information I have put up on the board.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Yes, Professor.
(whispering)
Hey. Hey, did you see something out the window?
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
(whispering)
What, out there? You mean the moon? Oh God, she’s watching us!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
No, no, it’s not full moon. Don’t you know? You have to know the order of the moon.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
I’ve gotta admit, I’m terrible at that.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Are you cheating off me again?
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Well, yeah, you’re sitting right beside me.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
(sighs)
Look. No. Up there on the parapet. I swear I saw somebody standing there.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Who could be standing top of the parapet? You’d have to be able to fly to get on top of the parapet.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
I know!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Oh, that’s your point! That’s weird!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Yeah!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Who can fly?!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
I know!
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Eyes forward, please!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
(aloud)
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Uh, carry the 2, and… baby.
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Mmm hmm. Mm hmm. I’ll just eat this apple while you continue to work.
(chomps noisily)
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
(whispers)
Meritt.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
(whispers)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Look. Let’s distract the professor and go outside and see if we can see what that was.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Ohhhh. Maybe we can worship a flying being rather than Celene, the Goddess of the Moon!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Are you crazy? You can’t say that!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Well, no one can fly! I don’t think Celene can fly, so maybe we should be worshipping the new thing!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
You are such a bad boy! I love it!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
I’m not going to wear the hood any more! I’ve decided!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Oh my god!
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Boys! Hands to yourselves!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Plan Beta! Distract!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Oh no! I’ve… thrown something to the other side of the room!
He throws a pencil, which clinks into a corner.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Could you please collect that for me?
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Fine. I will go and collect it for you. But this is really irresponsible.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Oh look! Your apple is rolling out the door!
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
What? How…?
(sighs)
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Two different directions! Whatever will you do?!
MIKE (AS THE TEACHER)
Okay, class. You go collect that apple outside while I try and find this pencil under all of these desks.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Yes, professor!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
They make their escape.
THE PARAPE:
SEA:
We cut to the parapet where Blat stands. And the darkness is swirling around him as tendrils reach out in every direction. But out of the darkness, rising up—this time beside him—is another form, also formed out of mist.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Blat! Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, this is new.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Do you recognise me?
MARIS:
And this fairy appears: a small fairy that would be very reminiscent of all the fairies that Blat has seen around Celene, and attending to Celene.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Blat! Blat! It is I, Tinkleberry!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh… Tinkleberry.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, yes! I know, there were so many of us, but I was one of Celene’s attendants, and I know that you are loyal servant of Celene. And—and I don’t know if you’ve heard but, but great destruction has come to the castle, to Celene’s home! The sun people, the sun people came to us, Blat, and you weren’t there to help! Have you heard?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve actually been to the castle.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes! So you’ve seen it? The destruction?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It seems pretty bad. Yes,
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I was one of the few to survive it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I’m so happy that you survived… Tinkleberry.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Of course I remember you. It would be quite rude for me not to remember one… moon fairy, out of the thousands that I passed on a single day.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I’m so flattered, because you were one of Celene’s favourites. Well, to be truthful, you are Celene’s favourite. And I’m so glad I found you, because she needs your help, Blat! She needs you. You are one of her last loyal subjects who will protect her!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh. She’s alive.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, oh yes! Yes, the sun people wanted it otherwise, but she is alive. She survived.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is she injured or perhaps sick?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
She is shaken. There is no doubt she is shaken, but I think if you came to her side, Blat, you would give her the courage she needs to to revive and to fight back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ll give her something.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Okay, that sounds like it could be positive.
I will show you the way. Are you ready to follow me?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes. Fine. Lead the way.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Let’s go.
MARIS:
And Tinkleberry takes off from the parapet, very rapidly, watching Blat follow behind her.
CARTE:
And Blat does follow.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
(furtive)
No, just push up! Push up! I’m almost to the top!
The two students strain and grunt as they climb up onto the parapet. The first finally manages to clamber up.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
(gasping for breath)
Oh, here, let me help you. Come on!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Grab my hand!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
No, no, I got you! Whoa!
More straining. Finally, they both make it up to the top and sit, panting.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
There’s nothing here. Why did you pull me up?
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
I don’t know. I just—I swear I heard talking. Did you hear them talking? Something? Talking?
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Talking to themselves? So the flying thing talks to itself? I don’t want to worship it anymore.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
(laughing)
Hey, look! Look! You can see the professor down there!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
(laughs)
Talk about—
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Wait! We can spit on him!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Oh! Wait! Aim for the moon! And by that, I mean his head!
They both start spitting noisily.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Uh, Meritt?
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Yeah?
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
How we gonna get down?
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Oh, simple! We’re just…
(realizes)
Ohhhh.
Quick! Pray to the winged thing to rescue us!
Dear wingèd thing, whose identity we do not know.
SEAN AND CARTER (AS THE STUDENTS)
Come. Come and collect us and land us in safety.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
And consume our souls.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
What?
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
What?
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Why would you want that?!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
I thought that was the prayer.
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
What? “Consume our souls”? Yeah, we gotta stop worshipping Celene.
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
Yeah.
ARRIVING AT THE MONASTER:
SEA:
Entering the larger village is Eggerton and Darcy. They look weary from the road. And this village spreads out before them: probably 30 or 40 buildings, except this village has what appears to be a gothic monastery rising out of the centre, that the village is built around and in service to.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m so weary from that road.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, it was a long road. But—but look, that building over there. That seems to be a place of worship, wouldn’t you say?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, yeah, you could probably worship something there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we should go check it out.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Check—why?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Because! This is probably that holy emanation place that that other person was referring to.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right. Right.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Maybe we can find something about Celene.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, let’s… let’s go knock on the strange gothic building’s door and see what happens.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hey, look up there. It looks like two kids are looking down at us.
SEAN AND CARTER (AS THE STUDENTS)
(in the distance)
Help! Help! Help!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, it must be their greeting.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh.
(shouts)
Help!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(shouts)
Hello! We also worship the moon!
CARTER (AS SECOND STUDENT)
Ohh… they’re so dumb. And I think one of them is a fairy!
SEAN (AS FIRST STUDENT)
What? No!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, you knock on the door.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Hello.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Ha ha, you’re a tall one, aren’t you? We’re here because we don’t want Celene to die.
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Hello.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Are you—okay, here. Okay. Ready? Ready? Um…
Hello! My name is Eggerton. I come from a faraway land, here to bring you goodwill and cheer!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Also, we have mustard.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We have four types of—
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
You may come in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! That’s all it took. They didn’t even want to know about the different types of mustard.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You know what? You’re right. It’s just good currency in these parts.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Can I see the mustard?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, you can.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Which kind of mustard are you interested in?
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
There’s… more than one kind?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
My friend! Let me tell you about the wonderful world of mustard.
(whispers)
Darcy, you go investigate while I talk with this guy about mustard.
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Whoa, I had no idea.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, let’s start with… Well, okay, there’s this plain yellow stuff. I mean, we have it, but…
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
What do you mean? That’s—that’s all we cherish.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, here you hold on to that. But how do you feel like about sprinkles versus sparkles?
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
(a revelation)
Oh my God.
MARIS:
And I move around behind the lunar monk to sneak into one of the first classrooms on the left.
SEA:
And you see the back of Father Ricardo, who is busily eating an apple.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
(smacking lips)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um…
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
(screams)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to startle you.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
(with a trace of an Irish accent)
Ohhh! You’re not one of my students!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You sound really familiar!
MIK:
(laughs uncontrollably)
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Well, I have a lot of family in these parts.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That would make sense.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
But that’s not… the point of my being frightened. You’re an adult and you’ve come in here to the place where we teach children and murder babies!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
What?
SEA:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
You didn’t know about the—don’t you worship Celene?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, oh. You mean the sacrifices. Yes—
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
That’s right!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
In my village we don’t use the M word. That’s not how we see it.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Well, call it what it is. We murder babies!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sacrifice!
SEAN (AS ANOTHER MONK)
Excuse me, Father. Have you seen Meritt and Johnson?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Oh, the two small boys?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER MONK)
Yes.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
They ran out and they never came back.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER MONK)
Ah. Very good. I’ll keep looking. Thank you.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
I’m upset ’cause I was hoping we could murder them later!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(to herself)
Oh. There’s a lot of that going on.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER MONK)
Oh, you mean sacrifice.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Right. Let’s call it what it is. We murder small people.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER MONK)
Let’s bring this up at circle. We’ve had this conversation many times.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
All right, semantics.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So, uh, Father, if I may call you that…
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Yes?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I, as you noted, am an adult, but I felt like my childhood education really suffered because I was not able to attend one of these lunar monasteries.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Oh! Tragic.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And I have come here as a supplicant to to learn more about Celene and how I can bring her closer to my heart. And I think the best way for me to achieve that is to get as close to Celene as I possibly can.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Ah!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And you, being as aged as you are—
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Ohh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
—surely must know where Celene’s holy castle or… house might be?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Well… you know that she has a large castle, where she lives?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
But in times of great strife and trouble, she hides in a large building—
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Sorry, just coming in. Lunch… lunch here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, we don’t need—there’s no lunch needed here!
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
We always have lunch this time. Ricardo! Here, I got your sandwich.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Ah! Thank you!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is that sparkly mustard on that?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Oh! It’s so pretty!
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Yeah! Ha ha, we’ve come across some amazing mustard recently.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. Right. Anyway, Father, you were saying about a large—
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
I’m sorry, no work during lunch.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
What I like is that this part sparkles… but this part is more sprinkly!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You should eat that. You should eat that really quickly.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
All right!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We don’t want it to get cold.
MIK:
Cut to 25 minutes later.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(keeping polite, with difficulty)
Mmm. Father, surely you could continue the sentence you were doing earlier about where Celene might be in times of strife? Is this a time of strife?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Wait! I’m almost at the part of the sandwich that’s not sprinkly but sparkly!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Mmm, sparkly, sparkly, ha ha. Just like the sky over Celene’s…
MIK:
Cut to 25 minutes later.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(groans)
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Those were good sandwiches, Ricardo.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Look! My napkin has sprinkles and sparkles and some of the regular yellow.
Silence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Father, I have three children I’m willing to sacrifice if you just talk to me.
MIK:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Now you’re speaking my kind of language.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Continue.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
So! In times of great strife, what Celene does is hide under the ground, in a very large building.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. And where would this building be?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Under the ground!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Where would the ground under which it is be?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Soil!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What region, Father? How far from here? In which direction?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Oh, it’s not far at all. And that—here’s the tricky part. It’s in the back of the building, underneath a bathroom that says it’s under repair!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You mean it’s here?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
(conspiratorial)
This is a clever ruse. The bathroom always seems to be “under repair”.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I understand. Are you saying that it’s here at the back of this building?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, hi everybody! I brought dessert!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. No.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, hi Darcy! Here. Do you want some dessert? These aren’t fairy cakes, but they’re a nice loaf.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I want no dessert.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You want no dessert? That’s not like you. Normally you like—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. I’m busy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Yeah. Okay.
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Ricardo, you should tell them that you can’t get in unless given permission by the fae.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Well, certainly, but she seemed very interested in it getting Celened up. Hers was a childhood bereft of Celene-raising.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, very—
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
I’m so sorry. So little tragedy in your life.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you. Yes, yes. Very lunar-lacking.
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Oh. Bless. Bless you. Bless you with tragedy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you. Thank you.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
So, look! This one here, delivering us the dessert. Perhaps this fae could then give permission for this one to go into the broken bathroom!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That would be really convenient for us.
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Well… Sure, if you want to leave those desserts here, you know…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I was gonna sit with you and enjoy—
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Yeah, that’s great. Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well—
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Oh! They have sparkles?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Well, is it mustard sparkles or just sparkles?
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
I don’t know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, thank you! So which direction is the bathroom that needs repair?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Well, it smells like a bathroom that’s in disrepair, so just follow your nose to find the moon.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’ll ask along the way, thank you.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Oh my, no. Mustard on this is not good at all.
Silence.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
I’ll finish it though.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
You know, I never saw that particular fae before. I wonder if I did the correct thing?
Ah well!
Silence.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
No, I’ve changed my mind. Mustard on this grows on you after a while.
Oh! Aftertaste. Ugh.
Where’s my water? Someone took my—wait! I think those two took my water! Guards! After them!
MIKE (AS YET ANOTHER MONK)
Uh… We fired the guards last week.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Whaaat?
MIKE (AS YET ANOTHER MONK)
Yeah, they tried some kind of protest against child murdering.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
They’re against that?!
MIKE (AS YET ANOTHER MONK)
I know. They got fired—
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Someone stole my water and is heading towards the secret Celene area!
MARISA (AS NUN)
Father! Father! I have shocking news, shocking news! It’s about the children! The children!
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Yes?
MARISA (AS NUN)
They haven’t been murdered at all!
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Whaaaat?
MARISA (AS NUN)
No! They were never murdered! Celene has simply taken them and used them in her servitude! But Father, this is one of your closest held beliefs. They’ve never died, any of them!
Silence.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Well, that’s it. If you need me, I’m going to be in Classroom 3, bashing my head against the chalkboard.
SEAN (AS THE MONK)
Do you want to take one of the desserts with you?
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
Oh, please. It really does grow on you after a while
MARISA (AS NUN)
I’ll reword the scriptures for you, Father. I’ll make sure it’s now corrected.
CARTER (AS FATHER RICARDO)
My life is a hollow lie.
THE FAE STON:
SEA:
Darcy steps through a door—a door marked “DO NOT ENTER—CALL JANITOR”.
But on the other side is the sound of birds. And there’s green grass and sun, and there is a grove that is a perfect circle. And in the centre of that grove is a very large fae stone and standing at that fae stone, arguing with it… is Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I demand entrance.
SEAN (AS THE FAE STONE)
(a low, rumbling laugh)
You can demand whatever you want.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’re just a fae stone. Let me pass.
SEAN (AS THE FAE STONE)
Gladly. You need merely have the permission of the fae. Which you no longer have.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Coward. So you expect me to simply stand here on the off chance that a fairy should just walk up and grant permission for me to enter?
Eggerton walks up.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look, Darcy! It’s one of those female eagles.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, is that Blat?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat? Blat? Blat!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! We found you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How you doing, buddy?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’re gonna hug it out, aren’t we.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We are so gonna hug it out! Come here!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Absolutely!

OUTTAKE: OVER A VILLAG:
SEA:
We’re over a village—a rather nondescript village. It’s pre-dawn and there’s the sun just starting to rise above…
Sorry.
We’re over a village. A rather unusual…

I’m so over this village.

Last time on The End of Time and Other Bothers:
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Justine! He has taken the bait.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
There is never defeat for Celene, not as long as I am here. I can be anything, anyone!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You will bring him here to the white palace. And the broken goddess inside him.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
It shall be done.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So do you have room in your bag for this mustard?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’re not going to win this with mustard. Leave the sprinkle mustard behind!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So we’re travelling to Celene’s castle to hug Blat. Is that the plan?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This is Hug It Out version 2.0.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So! I guess this is goodbye.
SEAN (AS MOTHER SPECKLEY)
I’m sorry that my plan did not work.
I do have one of these baubles. It will open a portal back to here.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Blat! Great destruction has come to the castle, to Celene’s home! If you came to her side, Blat, you would give her the courage she needs to to revive and to fight back.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in his gruff Blathoxil voice)
Lead the way.
SEA:
Darcy steps through a door. On the other side is a very large fae stone.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I demand entrance.
SEAN (AS THE FAE STONE)
(a low, rumbling laugh)
You need merely have the permission of the fae.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is that Blat?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat? Blat? Blat!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How you doing, buddy?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’re gonna hug it out, aren’t we.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We are so gonna hug it out!
THE PLA:
Whistling wind.
SEA:
It is the white tundra, and a figure is bundled up against the cold and entering a small hut. In the distance rises a white castle built out of ice that gleams in the late afternoon sun. Beside and around the castle are ice walls that climb hundreds of feet up to icy cliffs.
Blat, Darcy and Eggerton come and go from this hut, and we’re seeing everything sped up. We’re seeing the sun rise and fall, the moon rise and fall. And in and out of this hut these three figures go, some creeping off into the woods, other approaching the castle and watching and then coming back. And we slowly come down towards the hut as time returns to normal.
Coming in the front door and seeing the discarded boots and coats. Darcy and Eggerton are there and they are staring at a table and on this table rolled out is a crazy diorama, a recreation of the castle in the distance. And stepping in the door and taking off his cloak is Blat.
Everything they know about the layout of the palace is on the table in front of Darcy and Eggerton: the security system, the guards, what lies ahead.
What’s not known yet is their plan.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in his gruff Blathoxil voice)
So the plan is simple. We kill Celene. I get rid of this thing that’s inside of me that’s making me talk this way. And things go back to normal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So X marks the spot. That’s what… that’s… that’s what this thing is, right?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well X marks Celene, which is the spot.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sure… yeah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. So we need to go from here…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And where… which one are we?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, um, it’s not really on the board.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why aren’t we on the… aren’t we like… isn’t this a board of what we’re doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, we have to get to this location.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay, look… I’ve got three fairy cakes. Here we go. I’ve got a red one. That’s you, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Alright.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And I’ve got one with lots of sprinkles that’s really fun. That’s gonna be me. Then I’ve got this… well, it’s… I’ll be honest, it’s an orange cube. But it’s okay. It’ll be Darcy. We’ll put it there.
And that’s the three of us. And this is the hut. It’s not to scale.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s bigger than the hut. So, no.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So, we’re here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Um-hm.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And we need to find the X.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’re pretty certain where the X is, which is why we put the X on the diorama.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right! Right, right. Okay, no. Okay, so… so we just need to go to this X!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We get to the X.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
To the X.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And then murdering.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Now…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And then out.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…I feel like we need to talk about the murdering part.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you sure there’s a drawbridge?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I saw a drawbridge. I’m very certain. There was, um, a couple of them sitting around on the bridge.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
A couple drawbridges on the bridge?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no, there’s… there’s a couple of the fairies…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ahhhhh…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…who guard the castle on the bridge drawing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hmm. Wait, what?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, so it’s a bridge.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s always down, but sometimes it can go up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think we can know where Celene’s gonna be once we get in there.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But… the X.
SEA:
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I mean, isn’t that the whole point of the map is to have the X so we can be like… “Hey, there it is.”
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we’re focusing too much on the X. Celene does move around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
If we put the X here in the kitchen…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mm hm. Yep.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How do we know that she’s not actually up in the bed…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I will investigate the kitchen!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, but what if she’s up in the bedrooms?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Then we move the X.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gritted teeth)
We can’t move the X once we’re there.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why not?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
She is the X!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re not bringing this with us?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! How are we gonna fit it?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How are we gonna know where we are once we get there?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think the fairies are gonna notice us carrying this across the drawbridge.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You don’t think they’re gonna notice us coming in the castle?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, they’re not gonna notice you. You’re already a fae.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, I am. Thank you for noticing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So you’re gonna be the one that gets us inside.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it. This is the best plan ever.
What we’re gonna do… we’re gonna go into town, we’re gonna get a really long coat. Darcy, you’re gonna sit on Blat’s shoulders.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m gonna sit on your shoulders.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I… this isn’t gonna work.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re gonna put the coat on my shoulders and wrap it around all three of us. They’ll never know that the two of you are there. They’re just gonna see me. This is what I look like. Right?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A 15-foot fae in a giant coat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is a terrible idea.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How… how could it go wrong? Please tell me how this plan would not work.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So many multiple ways it could go wrong.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
“Hey, you’re not a fae.” Stab. That’s how it goes wrong.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Though I would point out that if they do stab, they’ll stab you. Because you’re the lower part of the coat. And don’t you have like superpowers or something now?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m still a mortal being.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, well… I thought there’s… you know, you’re different somehow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why don’t we make the coat plan Plan C?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How are we actually gonna get inside, Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s where it gets interesting.
Laughter.

Episode 22: Best Laid Plans.
ON THE BATTLEMENT:
Whistling wind again.
SEA:
The camera moves from the hut towards the ice castle, faster and faster, towards two tiny figures sitting on the top of one of the walls. Until we see that it is Celene, and she is looking through some kind of device at the hut in the distance.
The swirling sound of Justine appearing.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Justine?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, yes. Yes, Your Eminence?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
How long are they gonna continue to flit about and stay in that hut?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Well, I‑I think they’re confused. I think they don’t know what to do. And isn’t that the best behaviour that they could be exhibiting? They’re weak, they’re weak!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(booming angrily)
I want them in the labyrinth!
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I think if we give them time, they will attempt to get into the labyrinth in their own way. And then they’ll think it was their idea. Yes, yes?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I want you to give them the idea. I want them there by tomorrow night.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, yes your Eminence… of course. Immediately.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Or we could dine on your essence.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
No! No, no, no, no, that’s not an idea that I enjoy. I will make sure they are in the labyrinth by the time you say.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Good. Oh look… they’re coming—oh… only one of them’s coming out. You have your work cut out.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes. At once.
EGGERTO:
SEA:
We find Eggerton wandering through a small grove on a sunny day not too far from the hut and he’s looking for berries.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Come here, berries! Berry, berry, berry come here!
(sighs)
They’re not talking. It’s so much more work when they don’t just come to me.
A soft swirling
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
(in an aged crone voice)
Helloooo? Is someone there?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are you a berry?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
A berry? Oh no, no, no. Oh, hello, you… you are a fairy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I am a fairy.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Ooooohhh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who are you?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh, oh, well. I am a woman who is in need of assistance…
SEA:
(laughs)
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
…and you are the first one I’ve come upon in this forest. And if you help me I think I can show you where there’s some very good berries.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh yeah, I need some berries. It’s all part of our plan.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Ohhhh… what… what plan?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, Blat wants to murder Celene. But I think we really just need to get in there and give her a good hug.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Uh… oh… Blat? Who is Blat?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh well, he’s going by something else right now. He’s having something of an identity crisis ‘cos I think he has a couple of different goddesses inside him.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oooohhhh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You know, it’s a long backstory. You don’t need to worry about it.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh, well, I‑I actually might be able to help if you want to get to Celene!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Really!
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You know the castle?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I‑I know it very well actually.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You know the White Castle?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I do know the White Castle!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And you know an easy way to get inside the White Castle?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Well, it’s funny you should say that. Many, many years ago, I helped Celene when she was in a great deal of trouble and as a reward for that she allowed me to live in the castle… in a tiny room in the castle. But I’m able to come and go as I please.
And… and I could help you to get in there. And then you could help me with my problem!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That sounds absolutely lovely. Now, what’s your problem?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Well, my problem is best explained to you once we go to the castle. It’s easiest when you can see it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That checks out.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Let me go get my friends…
MIK:
(starts giggling)
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, I’m so glad I ran into you instead of one of your friends. That was very fortunate.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, they can be very difficult to get to know.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, they’re very standoffish at times.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh dear.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But under my leadership, I think they’re coming together.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh, you look like someone who would be a wonderful leader.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You should see my hat. I don’t have it here. I left it back at the Nexus where everyone might be dead. But it’s a great hat.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh, I do like hats. I would love for you to show that to me one day.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’ll have to go together sometime!
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Ohhh, I think that’s a wonderful idea. Now, do you think we can get your friends to come here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Sure, sure. Now, how do you feel about kitchens?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I… I feel fine about kitchens.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s great because at the Nexus, we’ve got a great kitchen.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Ohhhh…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So I’ve got all these mixing bowls and fruits and I’ve got lots of different types of pleather and sprinkles and sparkles and different types of icing and different types of filling…
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
(pointedly)
So you like to cook.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…and different types of pans in which I cook things. Some of them are bigger, some of them are smaller.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
(sharply)
Cooking is fun for you, is it?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Each of them has a slightly different shape… some of them are…
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
(witheringly)
You enjoy the kitchen environment, yes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
When I bake in them they come out looking a certain way…
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
That is wonderful.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ve actually got really rare cube trays too. And I make those here… these are the little orange… here, why don’t you try one of these little orange squares? I’ve got one here.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh, no, no…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You try… try. Here you… right in your mouth. Here you go.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I have a very delicate system. Oh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There you go. Okay!
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh!
(swallowing fairy cake)
Um… oh…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Tasty, isn’t it?
SEA:
Roll for fairy cakes.
MIK:
That’s a 10.
SEA:
You feel marvellously wonderful.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Ohhh!
SEA:
…Justine.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh my goodness. I’ve never felt something like that. You are a marvellous cook! Oh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I know. Isn’t it wonderful? Doesn’t it make you really consider your life choices?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
It… it is marvelous!
MARIS:
And just for a moment, this old woman seems to just blur a bit and come back into focus and just look a little off from an outside point of view.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh-oh-oh, well! That is… is fantastic I must say.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um-hmm, I’m still feeling the effects of the last one I ate I think.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I can imagine. I will have to get more of those from you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so do you want to come with me to get my friends or do you want to like meet us somewhere?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I think it would be best if you bring them here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, just right to this spot? Or do you wanna meet somewhere else?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
No, right here would be good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right here. Okay.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Just where you were looking for berries.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And what time do you think we should come back?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
I will meet you here in two hours.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Two hours. Okay. I’m gonna go get them. I’ll bring them here. What was your name again?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh, my name. Yeeeesss. My name is…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Is it Vamping?
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Oh, no, it’s… it’s Carolinia. That’s right, Carolinia.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Carolinia. It’s a beautiful name, Carolinia.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
Yes, I have a bad memory these days you see.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um-hm. Um-hm. Um-hm. Okay.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
So you come here and see Carolinia.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
And you can bring more of those little cakes if you want.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, I’ve got more right here actually.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
No, I’ll wait ’til later.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, it’s okay. Here… try… why don’t you try… this is the classic purple swirly. It’s the most popular one.
MARISA (AS JUSTINE)
(fading out)
Oh no… I couldn’t possibly…
BLA:
Far off in the woods, raven croaks.
SEA:
We find Blat walking along a different section of woods, heading towards an overlook that offers quite the pristine and perfect view of the castle in the distance.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(mutters, imitating the others)
“Celene’ll move around in the castle.” It’s ridiculous… I know exactly the spot that she’s gonna be in the castle and that’s why the X was there in the diorama… but just to be certain… I’ll look again.
(pause)
Yup.
Laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There she is. I knew it. I knew where she’d be.
A rumbling as Morrigu speaks within Blat’s mind.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
(whispering)
Are you sure?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m sure.
I don’t need you in my head any longer. I’m gonna need you for the next three, four hours tops. And then out you come. Because Celene’ll be dead and we can finally move on from this.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
Give me a god. I will give you so much in return.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Alright. You can have Celene.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
It feels like a trap.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No. You wanted a god, I offer you Celene. Done and done.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
You could have given me Brenda.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Brenda? Brenda’s not a god.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
Brenda is a god.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh, Brenda’s a god.
Well, that’s news to me. Sorry. Didn’t know.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
(frustrated sigh)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Celene. We’ll give you Celene.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
She knows. She watches us now.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t know what you’re talking about. She’s right—
No, she’s looking right at us.
Alright. Moving aside, moving aside, back into the darkness.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
Use the power of the tendrils.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Use the power of the ten… I don’t have to use the tendrils just yet. This is still reconnaissance.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
(growls)
You are more of a fool than I thought.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve heard that before.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
Don’t let me down.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You want Celene? I want to get rid of Celene. This’ll work out just fine.
THE HU:
A fire crackles in a hearth.
SEA:
So we return to the hut where Darcy is fidgeting. Looking nervous, tending the fire, checking her backpack. But she’s alone. Her companions have headed outside.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers to herself)
Alright, so Blat thinks the X should be here, but I think there should be an X here too. I mean, it really should be here too. And… ohhh… this isn’t gonna work and… and if we let Blat do this, this… this could destroy existence. I think we’re forgetting that Blat isn’t supposed to do this! Blat isn’t supposed to indulge these feelings. Aarrgggh… what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Come on Darcy… think, think, think.
(sighs)
The soft chiming music of Loxsyn’s theme.
SEA:
And your amulet begins to heat up against your skin.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What… is going on?
Loxsyn? Are you here? Loxsyn… if… if you’re here… if you know how to help me please, please tell me. Please give me a sign.
SEA:
And the door opens and Eggerton walks in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy! I have a great idea—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No wait.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m waiting for a sign. Just be quiet for a minute.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. I’m being quiet for you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Loxsyn… Loxsyn, please I‑I need guidance. Give me a sign!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I‑I actually…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(harshly)
Shhhhh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, sorry….sorry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shhhh… just wait… wait.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay… I’m waiting.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Lemme know if you see a sign.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Loxsyn… I’m really lost. Where do you think the X should be?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I actually found a cool way that we might be able to find the X.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um… if you… you just have to… where’s Blat? We need Blat.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uhhh… I think he went out to get some air or something. I don’t know.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, when Blat gets back we’ll go over it. I found a way into the castle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How did you…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
With my superior reconnaissance skills.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, that can’t be right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What do you mean it can’t be right?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, that can’t be right. How did you find out?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, because I‑I’m a leader and that’s what I do. It’s my job to find solutions.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no really… how did you find it? Did you stumble into it?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I—I…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did you fall into it? Did you walk into it?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Kind of? But I‑I mean it’s still my solution. So you know, it’s good.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, we should get Blat.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I found a way. Yeah… okay.
He opens the door and shouts into the whistling wind.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat!! Where are you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blaaaat!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blaaaat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat?
CARTE:
And Blat lands in front of the hut.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! Oh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You fly a lot more than you used to.
They head back inside and close the door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was right. X does mark the spot.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Told you so.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How do you know?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Reconnaissance. I saw her.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You two and reconnaissance. Oh boy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I was doing reconnaissance too! And I found a way into the castle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was doing reconnaissance. I never saw you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I was reconnaissancing over there. Where were you reconnaissancing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was reconnaissancing from up above.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, I was… I was off to the flank. On the lateral side.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was up above; I should have been able to see anything around the castle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, I was… I was in the wooded area though. I had cover. I was undercover.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, it doesn’t matter! Eggerton says he’s found a way into the castle.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, let’s go. Everyone! Follow me!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait… should we prepare? Maybe we should have a plan? Like…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe this is the plan!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How are we getting into the castle though?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The drawbridge. We’re gonna meet two fae by the drawbridge. The other fae’ll get us in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no, we’re not doing that plan anymore. I’ve got a new plan to get into the castle. Once we’re in the castle, we go to X marks the spot and then we hug both Celene and Blat at the same time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okaaaaay. How did you come up with this plan?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Because I’m the General.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That doesn’t track.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A general what?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I‑I… You know what, let’s just go! I’ll show you when we get there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, where… what did you see, Blat? How do you know about the X?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Simple. I saw a window and I saw Celene through it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You saw her?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And that’s the exact spot that’s on this map!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
She’s actually here?! This might actually work?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, she’s here but… I’m not so sure that the plan’s going to work.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, we don’t have one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The plan will be just fine. I have a plan! That’s what I’m saying. Let’s go. Let’s go!
He opens the door again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I guess this is our best shot. This… this might actually be the sign… the sign that Loxsyn is giving me! It might actually be to follow Eggerton!
Pause.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, I don’t think that can be right.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re right. No.
Well, maybe we’ll see the sign as we follow him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
He came up with this idea?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Apparently.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We’re gonna die before we even hit Celene.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, guys, come on. I already went out the door and I went for like 30 seconds there and realized you weren’t there. So let’s go for real now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right. All right. I’m behind you.
SEA:
So Eggerton heads out again from the house, checking back periodically to ensure he’s being followed. Darcy, with a perplexed look on her face, looking around. And Blat, with an even more perplexed look on his face, following, pausing and following.
THE CLEARIN:
SEA:
Eggerton enters a familiar clearing in the woods. And it is empty.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, she’ll be here soon. Don’t worry, guys. Come on.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
She. She?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I made a new friend!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This sweet old lady.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What sweet old lady?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh… Cindy Lou-who or something like that? I don’t know.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You don’t know her name?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, no, I didn’t think to write it down at the time because I didn’t know she’d be coming back. But…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
The person that you were going to meet here… you didn’t think that they were going to come back? Then why are we meeting them here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, and she should be coming back soon.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What did she look like?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, she looked like a sweet old lady. Sweet old ladies in the woods are always trustworthy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What’s a sweet old lady doing in the woods this close to Celene’s castle? Did you ask yourself that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I was looking for berries. And she answered my call for berries. And, um, she needs some help. And she said she’d help us too.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
How?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She… she said she’d help us get us in the castle.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Is she a fairy?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um, no, she’s just a sweet old lady.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This is… this is way too coincidental. What’s going on here? Is this Celene? Is Celene playing some kind of game? It sounds like her.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And so we wait.
For Cindy… Lou-who.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh… I have a bad feeling about this. Oh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(starting to break character and laugh)
Me too. Copyright infringement’s nothing to joke about.
Loxsyn’s music returns briefly.
SEA:
Darcy, your amulet begins to heat up against your skin. And the rest of you start to see a white light starting to filter through her garments.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um… um, Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you have a lantern inside your shirt?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no. It’s… it’s my amulet. It’s doing it again. It did this back in the little cottage. It must be Loxsyn trying to reach me, right?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe… or did you like leave it on the fire and forget?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And then put it back on?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! It’s Loxsyn. It must be Loxsyn.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. What does Loxsyn have to say?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know. It’s like I can’t connect with her. I’m trying.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
How are you trying?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I’m trying to focus. It’s hard with you around. Just… just… just a minute.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Loxsyn, I feel your presence. I know you want to communicate with us.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispering under Darcy)
Blat, be quiet. Darcy’s trying to concentrate. It’s very important that she be able to focus…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? I’m helping.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Stop it! I can hear you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well… Blat… quiet!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Loxsyn. What is it… what do you want to tell us?
MARIS:
And I concentrate so hard to try and communicate with my goddess.
A swirling sound.
SEA:
And that’s when the snow begins to melt beneath your feet, moving at a very rapid rate and pulling back to reveal stairs and a door.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look at that!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But—what’s going on?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That must be Loxsyn’s doing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But I thought you said it was some old woman?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, maybe that was Loxsyn appearing to me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps, whispers)
Maybe it was.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe Loxsyn’s communicating to you through me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why? Why would she do that to me?
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? What do you mean why would she do that you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I mean… I mean I’m sure she moves in mysterious ways and uses all sorts of, uh, intermediaries. That’s true; I’m sure it could have been you, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right. So, anyway, I guess like, they’re stairs so we might as well take ’em.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, that’s always a good idea.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Go deeper into it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What do you think, Blat? Is it a trap?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s more than likely a trap. But I feel better knowing that this strange old lady that he met isn’t here yet. So let’s go down the stairs before she comes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know. The strange old lady might already be with me if it’s Loxsyn.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I feel safe. I feel like this is the right path.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh… ‘kay. That’s, that’s good. But she’s not here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Alright… so you go first. No, no she’s inside us I think Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why is she inside you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, because she wasn’t really an old woman.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She was.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
She was the embodiment of Loxsyn.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, there was an old woman.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, that was just what she wanted you to see. Oh, you’re not a believer. You don’t understand.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Alright. I’m gonna go down the stairs. You guys hash this out.
He goes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Alright, you go ahead.
(whispering)
Eggerton?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you a little worried? Remember what we were told? That if Blat goes down this path, it could be the end of existence! I don’t know if we’re doing the right thing. Should we be helping him?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You think this is literally the path?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! I think this is the path to Celene, but I don’t know if we should be encouraging Blat to take it! Maybe you and I need to take on Celene.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What if we trap Blat on the way in and then you and me take down Celene on our own for Blat so he doesn’t have to do it? And time can end but existence won’t.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wow, that’s a terrifying thought. But we might have to do it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, ready? On three. One, two, three—whoaaaa team Eggerton!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uhh… yay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Alright… let’s go!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
MIK:
So Eggerton follows Blat down the stairs.
MARIS:
And Darcy follows Eggerton down the stairs.
Loxsyn’s music returns but takes on a darker tone.
SEA:
As Darcy takes her first step the medallion burns even hotter. Almost. Almost hurting.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ahh. Ahh! Wait! Wait, m‑my amulet… it burns! Maybe… maybe this isn’t right!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s probably just like, “Yeah! Go team!”
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know but I don’t think this is how it works.
Blat! Blat? What do you see down there?
Blat?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat!
We better go and find him.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know… what if we get trapped in here?
Ohhhh! The amulet… it burns!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See, it’s telling you to stop doubting yourself!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, I don’t know about that.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That can only be what it means. It’s burning to say, “Yeah, you got this, girl.”
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we gotta find Blat. Let’s go. Let’s go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, let’s go get Blat.
SEA:
So Eggerton… you head down further?
MIK:
I do.
The music reaches a crescendo.
SEA:
Darcy, as you go to take your next step, it starts to burn the skin. You feel the skin pulling off your body.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
AAAAHHHH!!!
MARIS:
And I run back up the stairs and throw myself on the ground.
SEA:
And with that, the door disappears.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! No! Eggerton!!
MIDROL:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey, everyone, it’s Seanw as you probably know. Thanks so much for being with us. I want to give some shout outs. Apologies if I get any of these names wrong—I’m trying really hard.
So first of all to our new patrons—woo-hoo! Raise the roof! Ann Sloan, sayaks, Carlötta Beautox, Coral, Toni and Christian Vikjær Bote. Thank you all so much. Your support means everything and it allows us to continue to create more shows and more episodes.
And now it’s time to shout out some of our oldies but goodies, our old timers. I don’t know what to call all of you except to say you’re all amazing for having been with us since the beginning. So let’s give a shout out to Benjamin Epstein, Kathleen Werry and Hannah Reicks. Thank you three so much from everyone at the table.
Now, I mentioned a few times before, but I want to let everyone know there is a really cool Facebook group called the Reckless Play Guild. That’s us, Dumbgeons and Dragons, The Lucky Die and Dark Dice, all in one place. Super fun. Come on and join in. There’s some interviews happening of all the cast now—gonna be a lot of fun.
But I wanna talk to you a little bit more about The Lucky Die Podcast. It’s a D&D 5e actual play of four friends, basically dealing with the end of the world. If you like The End of Time, you’re gonna love the setup for this show. “Demons and celestials have started stalking the lands. Tensions between the factions leave death in their wake and blood red clouds boil across the sky.” Eh? Eh? Check it out. It’s called The Lucky Die Podcast. You can find it everywhere you find podcasts, and we’ll put a link in our show notes.
Alright, as I mentioned last time, there’s gonna be a short gap before we’re back and running again. That’s because we had some scheduling issues. We’ve resolved those but until we can catch up, there’s gonna be a bit of a delay before the next episode.
Now, that said, there is a bonus coming soon! A lot of you wanted to know what happened to Scribbles. So that is coming. As to when we’re gonna be back, we promise it won’t be that long. And we’re gonna let you know on Twitter, on Facebook, on our Discord, on Patreon—so be sure to follow us in one of those places. And we can’t wait to be back and going again.
And until then… here’s the end of Episode 22.
Music sting.
MIDROLL: ARTS AND CRAFT:
SEA:
Oh, Marisa, I’m glad I caught you here in the green room. Um… look, we’ve got a problem with these dice boxes that Michael’s making.
MARIS:
What’s wrong?
SEA:
He won’t stop.
MARIS:
Oh no.
SEA:
They’re everywhere. I’m not sure what to do… I need you to talk to him.
MARIS:
Okay, so wait a minute… first of all, he was knitting dice boxes.
SEA:
Yeah.
MARIS:
And now he’s carving the dice boxes.
SEA:
Yes.
MARIS:
And he won’t stop?
SEA:
And now he’s moved past that; he’s making them out of food, he’s 3D printing them, like…
MARIS:
Oh no.
SEA:
Like, they’re everywh… like you can’t open any closet here and now they’re filling up the recording… like how are we going to get in and record?
MARIS:
He’s obsessed.
CARTE:
Hey, guys? I don’t have a chair anymore. Mike says that I’m just gonna balance myself on about fifty different dice boxes. I can’t do this anymore.
SEA:
I know… I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Carter. It’s because he took the chair apart to make dice boxes.
CARTE:
(sighs)
SEA:
I’m gonna get you another chair. But I need somewhere to put these. Does anybody have any…? Come on, just take a few more home, guys… come on.
MARIS:
What?! No, no, no, I don’t want any more of those things. I have enough of Mike’s junk that I’ve taken to my place to clear this place out. I can’t work like this anymore, Sean.
CARTE:
Oooo!! Ooooo! I know!
We make money by getting rid of the dice boxes to people who are really into the show.
SEA:
Oh my God, that’s brilliant.
CARTE:
Will Mike let us do that?
SEA:
Okay, alright. We’re gonna pitch Mike.
So people will go to otherbothers.com. They can join our Patreon and maybe get a dice box.
CARTE:
Get a fairy dice box…
MARIS:
I don’t know if we’re gonna be able to sell the eggplant dice boxes that way though.
SEA:
Yeah, I think we’ll just throw those out.
MARIS:
Compost.
MIK:
Oh, there you guys are! I’m looking for some toothpaste. Do any of you have toothpaste?
SEA:
Oh God.
Music sting.
THE TUNNEL:
Eggerton and Blat’s voices echo down a long tunnel.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat. Where are you? Blat. Darcy? Darcy? Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’m further ahead.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Oh. I can’t see… it’s too dark.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s just I’m ahead of you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, is that you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That… that is not me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
‘kay… is that you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(startled)
Aaarggh! That is me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh… okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s just one long corridor.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ohhh.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s fine. Where’s Darcy?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, well she was behind me and then she screamed and ran away.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
She screamed and ran away?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She screamed and ran away. And then the door closed.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhh, great. Separated again.
She’s not turning into some sort of like, anthropic animal, is she?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I dunno.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Great. Alright, well, let’s just keep moving forward.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
OK. Which way?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, not the way we came where there’s no door.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I can’t see. It’s too dark in here!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just forward, in the direction you were heading.
SEAN (AS A GRUFF VOICE)
Towards me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, thank you. That’s very helpful.
Silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat? Blat? Why’d you stop talking?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I thought maybe if I stopped talking I could engage in the element of SURPRISE!
SEAN (AS GRUFF VOICE)
No, I pretty much know you’re here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
And who might you be?
Silence.
SEAN (AS GRUFF VOICE)
Oh, are we doing names?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m Eggerton! I can’t see anything ‘cos it’s very dark in here, but it’s nice to meet you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And I’m Blathoxil.
SEAN (AS GRUFF VOICE)
Well, that sounds like a demon name.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Actually it is a demonic name, yes.
SEAN (AS GRUFF VOICE)
Oh! Huh. I haven’t dealt with a demon in a long time. Umm… I’m Beehox.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Beehox?
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
Yeah.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And pardon the rude question since I can’t see, but what are you, Beehox? You don’t sound like a fairy.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
(guffawing)
Oh, nooooo, nooooooooo. Ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I’m, I’m… you probably know me as a troll. I’m gonna kill you both.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I see.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Very good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, I have a question re: killing… of the two of us.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
Oh, can I ask a question first?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, does it have to do with my question?
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
Hmm… I’m not sure.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Why don’t I ask my question? And then if you think your question supercedes it in the order of logical, like movement, then you ask your question.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, ready?
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
Yup.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Can you not kill us?
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
Can either of you see in the dark?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s a narrow hallway. All I have to do is aim straight. Bazooka.
Blat’s bazooka assembles. Rhythmic music begins.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
I don’t know what that is. I’m gonna assume the answers are no. So yeah, I gotta kill you both.
CARTE:
And Blat pulls the trigger.
SEA:
Okay, roll volley. Uh, this will be at a negative because it is dark.
CARTE:
That’s a 7.
SEA:
Okay. Uh, so that is a partial success. Uh, so I will say that it hits—but far faster and closer than you expected.
CARTE:
Ahhhhh.
SEA:
Uh, so what is your damage on that?
CARTE:
I think it’s an 8?
(rolls)
3!
SEA:
Okay, so you’re gonna take half of that, so 1 damage. Do you have armour?
CARTE:
Uh, I do not.
SEA:
So you hear the sound of a bazooka. You hear a roar from Beehox. And then silence.
The music ceases.
CARTE:
Blat sticks his necrotic tendrils out in front of him, feeling around to see if he can find Beehox.
SEA:
Doesn’t seem to be anything there.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Alright, I don’t think he was as tough as we thought.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I don’t think he was as tough as we thought!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shouting)
I can’t hear you! My ears are ringing!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?!
CARTE:
Blat grabs Eggerton…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ooop!
CARTE:
…by the scruff of the neck, and they start slowly moving forward.
SEA:
Okay, so they’re moving forward down the passage. And you come across a form on the ground. Quite large.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
How are your ears?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I think they’re getting better.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Good. Search him.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh. Search who?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This figure on the ground.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can’t see anything.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s because it’s dark. Use your hands.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, here… I’m using my hands.
The music resumes.
SEA:
And that’s when the troll roars alive and goes to bite Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
MIK:
So I try and pull back.
SEA:
Okay, roll Defy Danger.
MIK:
That’s a 6.
SEA:
So you are going to… will you roll for me damage of d8?
MIK:
d8.
SEA:
Plus 3.
MIK:
5.
SEA:
8. Do you have any armour?
MIK:
I have 1.
SEA:
Okay, so you take 8 minus 1.
MIK:
(laughing)
7!
SEA:
(laughing)
There you go. We’re doing math. So you hear a horrible crunching sound…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
My arm!
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
(guttural laughing; then, with his mouth full)
Oldest trick in the book!
CARTE:
And Blat sends his tendrils down onto the floor towards the figure.
SEA:
Okay, so read us the tendrils; this is the first time they’re being used.
CARTE:
“As you move, you leave behind small wisps of black, swirling smoke. These form into tendrils at your beckoning and strike out at up to three creatures within 30 feet of you. Roll +Wisdom. On a 10+ your tendrils connect with their prey, who takes 1d8 necrotic damage. On 7–9 your tendrils connect and do 1d8 damage, but you take damage for their attacks on your necrotic limbs.”
SEA:
‘kay.
CARTE:
Well, this is a terrible idea.
Laughter. Carter begins rolling.
SEA:
Plus Wisdom.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Plus Wisdom, which…
MARIS:
I don’t think you have any.
CARTE:
…if I remember… yes, is a zero.
MARIS:
(off Carter’s roll)
Oh wow.
CARTE:
11!
MARIS:
Wow.
SEA:
Roll 1d8 +Wisdom is a 0. So roll 1d8.
CARTE:
(rolling)
A 2.
MARIS:
Oh, that’s a waste.
SEA:
So you feel the tendrils connect and you get half of that back.
CARTE:
Ohh!
SEA:
So you get 1 hit point back by stealing the life force from this troll, who scrambles back when he’s pierced by one of these tendrils, but he’s still holding on to Eggerton with his mouth.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
AAAAAAaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
SEA:
Okay, so Eggerton’s just gonna scream this round. So the troll… you feel a whoosh of air.
CARTE:
And Blat steps aside to try to avoid it.
SEA:
Roll Defy Danger.
CARTE:
7.
SEA:
Okay, so you have a choice here. You can completely dodge this by just backpedalling really fast and just leave Eggerton to his fate. He’ll be out of range of your necrotic tendrils. Or you can sort of sidestep it trying to miss most of it, but stay close.
CARTE:
I’ll try to stay close.
SEA:
Okay, so would you roll the damage for me? It’s a d10 on the club.
CARTE:
d10 on the club?!
MARIS:
Yikes.
SEA:
Uh, that’s 12-sided. You might want a 10-sided die… as much as I’d love to see you roll that.
MIK:
Just roll d20. Worst case.
SEA:
(off Carter’s roll)
Oh god. So you take 9 damage.
CARTE:
Ohhhh.
MARIS:
Oh my god. Everyone’s dying here.
MIK:
Why are you so melancholy right now?
SEA:
Oh wait, but you’re gonna take partial because I said… you’re gonna take partial so you’re gonna take half of that so that’s gonna be 5. Well, we round down, 4… so take 4. So you’re at 15.
So the club sorta comes off your shoulder and you hear the troll sort of laughing… muffled ‘cos he still has Eggerton in his mouth.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
(muffled laughing)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
AAAAAAaaaaarrrghh!
CARTE:
Blat listens carefully for Eggerton’s screams…
SEA:
Yup.
CARTE:
…and aims slightly higher from that.
SEA:
With what?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka.
A new bazooka appears.
MARIS:
Oh no.
MIK:
S——t.
SEA:
Okay, so I want you to roll Volley and I want… Eggerton, I want you to roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
Oh my gosh.
SEA:
(laughs)
Precision bazookaing… it’s a Blat special.
MIK:
One, two, three.
CARTE:
(rolling)
4.
MIK:
(rolling)
5.
SEA:
So luckily… uh Blat you just… you hear the shell go all the way down this hall so you can tell the hall is quite long and you hear it explode and you hear a cave-in further down. And all kinds of commotion further down the hall.
And you hear the troll laughing as he goes to bite down harder on Eggerton, who still has done nothing to try and get free… so Eggerton is just gonna take damage. So Eggerton, I need you to roll 1d8.
MIK:
1d8.
SEA:
He’s just chewing.
MIK:
(rolling)
1. And I’ve got 1 Armor.
SEA:
Okay, so he’s basically chewing.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
(chewing)
This is a tough one. A lot of gristle.
MIK:
Rude. I’m gonna smack him with my other hand on the nose.
SEA:
Do you want to look at your character sheet at some point during this whole thing and like some of your powers? Like, you actually have an attack when you do your Druid thing?
MIK:
Oh, yeah.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIK:
Forgot about that. I’m going to… turn into a mouse.
SEA:
(laughing)
Okay.
MARIS:
No, that’s smart.
MIK:
Mm-hm.
SEA:
Okay, so… well it’s dark so, so no one will know… still nobody understands your powers. Okay. So go ahead, act this out.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(voice rising to a squeak)
It hurts so much. I just gotta get away. I gotta get away—!
(devolves into mouse scurrying sounds)
SEA:
Okay, so roll your Strength.
MIK:
2d6?
SEA:
Yup, 2d6 + Strength.
MIK:
10.
SEA:
So, in your mind, you become as small as a mouse. And you manage to free your arm and scurry away. Where are you running?
MIK:
I’m just running.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
Full speed.
SEA:
So you hear the pitter patter of… Blat, you hear the pitter patter of what sounds like normal sounding feet of Eggerton.
And the troll roars in rage and you sorta feel the troll moving. Uh, roll Defy Danger for me, Blat… assuming you’re gonna try and defend yourself.
CARTE:
9.
SEA:
Do you have a plus on Dex?
CARTE:
Uh, I do! 10.
SEA:
Okay, so you manage to step right in close to the troll and his swing just goes right over your shoulder and you hear the rock rip apart where his club hits the ground. But he is now right up in your face. His breath is… not good.
CARTE:
I aim the tendrils for the not-good breath.
SEA:
Roll for tendrils!
CARTE:
4.
MIKE AND MARIS:
Ugh.
SEA:
Uh, so he bites off one of your tendrils and you take 2 damage.
CARTE:
Aaarrrghhhh!
SEA:
You feel one of the tendrils just get ripped right off.
Eggerton, you are running down the hall.
MIK:
Mm-hm.
SEA:
Yeah, you are free. You hear the sound behind you, craziness. It’s dark, you’re bouncing off of each wall back and forth and blind.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ow!
Laughter.
SEA:
And back to you. You feel the arms of the troll. He drops the club, and you feel him grabbing you in a wrestler hold, and trying to like lift and snap your back—almost like your training scenario.
CARTE:
Ahhh! I will attempt to avoid the bear hug.
SEA:
Okay. Roll Defy Danger.
CARTE:
That would be a 10.
MARIS:
Wow.
SEA:
Okay. Tell me how you—in the dark, blind—avoid this bear hug.
CARTE:
The tendrils that I have left snake up and smash him under the chin.
SEA:
Alright, roll 1d8.
CARTE:
3.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
Grrrrrrr! Would you just die already?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I could ask you the same thing.
Silence.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, did I not mention?
Bazooka.
Another bazooka appears.
SEAN (AS BEEHOX)
What?! No, we’re right next to… we’re point blank!
CARTE:
4.
SEA:
Luckily for Blat he misses. And Eggerton, I need you to roll a Defy Danger…
MARIS:
(laughing)
Oh no.
SEA:
…down the hall as a shell comes careening down, bouncing off each wall.
MIK:
7.
SEA:
So it narrowly misses Eggerton, goes just past his left ear… strikes the far wall and detonates, sending a rain of stones and shards out in every direction.
DARC:
SEA:
We return to above ground, where the snow is reforming, until there is no sign… even no footsteps to show where the hole, let alone Blat and Eggerton once walked.
And Darcy is kneeling in the centre of this clearing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! No! Blat! Eggerton!
(gasping)
MARIS:
And Darcy starts rolling around in the snow and grabbing the snow and putting it against her chest and trying to soothe the burning and the…
SEA:
Yeah.
MARIS:
Has it stopped burning?
SEA:
Yes. It has stopped burning. I mean there is a mark… you now have the symbol sort of burned into your skin.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! Eggerton! No, no, this can’t be happening. What… what do I do? What do I do? I‑I don’t know what to do… I can’t…
MARIS:
And I start scrabbling through the snow and trying to dig through the snow and I’m digging and digging. Am I even coming close to any kind of hatch or door?
SEA:
No.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, no. Oh, no, Loxsyn. Loxsyn, help me. What do I do? What do I do?
MARIS:
And I get up and I start looking around and I’m panicking and I’m pacing back and forth.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! Eggerton! Blat! Eggerton!
Oh, no. But… wait, wait.
MARIS:
And I reach into my satchel and I just start pulling out everything in my satchel.
SEA:
Yup.
MARIS:
And I pull out the little apple I was given.
SEA:
Yup.
MARIS:
And I pull out the ICE‑T. And I pull out the smash bauble that I was given.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, what does? What does? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Uh… wait. Didn’t they say that this would get me back? This would get me back… I can’t remember, I can’t remember.
MARIS:
And I take the, um, the smashy smash bauble and I just throw it on the ground.
SEA:
And nothing happens for a couple seconds.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait—
MARIS:
And I pick it up again.
SEA:
(laughing)
In pieces.
MARIS:
And I throw it on the ground again. Oh yeah, if it’s in pieces, now I’m like “No, No!” And I try… but I just sort of scatter them on the ground again.
A roaring sound, soft but growing louder.
SEA:
And then slowly you see a darkness forming. And as if you were seeing the world bending a little and then it starts to flow outwards. And you start to see this blackness popping larger and larger. And this growing sphere that starts to look like a portal.
MARIS:
And I stand in front of the portal and.. I am truly conflicted. I feel like I can’t go through it, I can’t stay. But I’m completely at my wit’s end. And I start to move towards the portal.
And finally I just go through it.
The roaring sound grows, then stops abruptly. The winter wind is replaced by birdsong.
SEA:
Okay. And you step out into a beautiful sunny day. And there is a path leading up to Temple Idries. And one of the Slaad is a little surprised.
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
Ohhh! Ohhh! Oh, it’s you!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(frantic)
Yeah, yes, it’s me. Where’s, where’s the Sister? Where’s the… where’s Mother Speckley?! Where’s Mother Speckley?!
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
Slow down. Slow down.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I can’t, I can’t. It’s Blat and Eggerton.
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
What? Blat?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The plan! The plan’s gone all wrong. I mean there was no plan. It was a terrible plan, really. But any plan that we had has gone completely wrong!
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
The Prophet? Is something wrong with the Prophet?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, yes! The Prophet, the Chosen One who you serve.
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
The Chosen One?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…is in trouble!
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
Then, come we must go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, let’s go, let’s go!
SEA:
And we leave the two of them running towards the tree in high speed.
THE TUNNEL:
SEA:
We return to darkness and the sound of blood dripping and heavy breathing, as Blat finally lowers his bazooka and leans against a wall, the troll not moving before him.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(winded)
Alright, you better not be fooling me again.
CARTE:
And Blat starts smashing the figure before him with his tendrils, seeing if he’ll get up.
SEA:
He doesn’t move.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(breathing heavily)
Alright, that wasn’t so bad. We’re still alive. I’m sure Celene’s only 200 times this powerful.
Eggerton! Eggerton, where are you?
Soft harp music.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(weakly)
Blat! Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eggerton, c’mere.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I‑I don’t think I can, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What are you talking about? It’s safe now. We gotta get to the end of the hallway and start digging our way through rubble. I hit it with the bazooka a couple of times. I think I caused a cave-in.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I‑I think you… might need to do that on your own.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
C’mon Eggerton. I don’t have Darcy. I’m gonna need your help. C’mon.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I, um… it’s gotten cold below my waist.
CARTE:
And Blat feels down with his tendrils to see if he can find Eggerton.
SEA:
Half of Eggerton is beneath the roof that caved in.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh, Eggsy.
CARTE:
Blat carefully begins picking up rocks and throwing them away from the cave-in.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(straining)
Come on, Eggerton… get up. When you feel the weight shift off you, move away, move back.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I‑I’ll try.
But before you do that Blat, can… can you do me a favour?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What’s that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Um… can you just be Blat again?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs softly)
I can’t, Eggerton. I’ve got… the M‑word inside me. That’s why I sound this way.
Come on. Get your pouch open. It’s nothing that a fairy cake can’t fix.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I‑I can’t find it. I think it might have fallen off. Umm…
But I‑I just… it’s kind of scary and dark in here. Um, so if you could just, you know, be Blat again for a few minutes?
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(voice still husky)
Man, I do love filing.
And shirts.
MIK:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And I’m in love with Darcy. But I don’t think she loves me.
Probably because she’s in love with you. Because you’re a general.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That checks out.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All we gotta do is find you a nice big hat.
But first, we’re gonna find that fairy cake satchel.
SEA:
After a few minutes, Blat realizes that it must be on the other side of the rubble.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I don’t know if this jar of mustard’s gonna help. It’s all I could find. I think it’s got sparkles in it.
Come on, Eggsy. Just take a little bit from the jar.
Eggsy?
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, what have I done?

Hey, it’s Eggerton! I’ve got a quick important message for Winter. Everyone else, stop listening for a second.

LAST TIME…
Fast-paced music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
Last time on The End of Time and Other Bothers:
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in his gruff Blathoxil voice)
So the plan is simple. We kill Celene. I get rid of this thing that’s inside of me that’s making me talk this way. And things go back to normal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I found a way into the castle.
SEA:
Darcy, your amulet begins to heat up.
The snow begins to melt beneath your feet to reveal stairs and a door.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Maybe Loxsyn’s communicating to you through me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why? Why would she do that to me?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait! Wait, m‑my amulet… it burns! Maybe… maybe this isn’t right!
MARIS:
And I run back up the stairs and throw myself on the ground.
SEA:
And with that, the door disappears.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No!
MARIS:
And I pull out the smash bauble.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Didn’t they say that this would get me back?
SEA:
And you step out into a beautiful sunny day.
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
Ohhh! Ohhh! Oh, it’s you!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The Chosen One is in trouble!
SEAN (AS SLAAD)
Then come, we must go!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, let’s go, let’s go!
SEAN (AS GRUFF VOICE)
I’m Beehox. You’d probably know me as a troll. I’m gonna kill you both.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka.
His bazooka materializes.
SEA:
So it narrowly misses Eggerton, strikes the far wall and detonates, sending a rain of stones and shards out in every direction.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eggsy, come here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I‑I don’t think I can, Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Come on, Eggerton… we’re gonna find that fairy cake satchel.
Eggsy?
TEMPLE IDRI:
Birds chirp in the background.
Running footsteps approach.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(panting)
Come, come this way! We must find Mother Speckley for you!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes! Hurry! Get her! Where is she?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I don’t know! Hold on, come. Open the doors! Open the doors, open the doors!
The door creaks open.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Wait. I swear, she was here in the main chamber.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Lazbo, we have to find her. This is urgent.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I understand. But… why is there nobody here?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why is there nobody here? I don’t know! You’ve been the one here. Where is everyone?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I was out in the garden.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, you must have noticed everyone just leaving!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Nobody left. I will check downstairs! Wait here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
SEA:
Lazbo runs down into the tunnel, and you are alone inside Temple Idris. And aside from the receding footsteps of Lazbo and his heavy breathing, you hear nothing else.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello? Hello, Mother Speckley? Anyone? Other Slaad? I need help! Somebody!
SEA:
And your amulet begins to glow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
Loxsyn.
Loxsyn, what are you doing to me? I’m so confused! I thought you sent me on one path, and then you closed the door and now my friends are in trouble. You have to help me. Loxsyn?
SEA:
And you hear a voice, and it says…
CARTER (AS LOXSYN)
(whispers)
Apple fritter.
MIK:
(laughs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sternly)
I do not have access to any baked goods, Loxsyn. This is not a good time for your appetites to come to the fore. Just help me, please.
SEA:
Your amulet begins to glow even brighter, filling the room with a blinding light. And you sense an apparition of an ephemeral figure, stepping forward out of the light, that you can sort of see through. And she doesn’t look happy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Loxsyn! You came! Please, you have to help me. What do I do? What do I do?
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
(whispers)
Bring baked goods.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t have baked goods! You know what’s going on! This is urgent. My friends might be dead already.
SEA:
And the figure nods, and gestures at the altar, where a book begins to form, solidifying.
And then the light is gone, and Loxsyn is gone.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
There’s nobody. I can’t find anyone!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t understand why everyone’s gone.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I don’t understand either. Whew! It’s just everybody.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right. Listen, I have to look at this book.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
What book?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The book on the altar.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No—there wasn’t a book on the altar, ever.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, there is now, Lazbo.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh.
MARIS:
So I walk over to the altar.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
What is it?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It was left here by my goddess.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(with reverence)
Oh.
SEA:
As you approach the altar, you see a book you saw once before, long ago, in the Academy of the Fallen. Except it doesn’t have your symbol on the front. It doesn’t have Eggerton’s symbol on the front. It has Blat’s symbol on the front.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait. This wasn’t my book. This is… this is Blat’s book. Why?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
The Chosen One’s book?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, the Chosen One’s book.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(gasps)
May I touch it?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I guess. Go ahead.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Everyone will be named Lazbo from here on out!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, if there is anyone left.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, that’s a good point, actually.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So? Did you feel anything?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No. Well, yes! I felt pleather and dust… and a sense of wonderment.
Pause.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, give it to me.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay.
MARIS:
So I pull it away from Lazbo and I open it.
SEA:
Okay, you open the book.
MARIS:
What do I see? Can I read it?
SEA:
Inside, as the first time you opened these books, it just looks like unreadable gibberish.
MARIS:
(laughs)
I don’t remember the words I’m supposed to say.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
What? You’re supposed to say words?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The first time we used this book, I think there were words, and… and I can’t remember. I’m too stressed out!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Try “Chosen One”.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, okay. That’s a good idea. Um… Chosen One!
Silence.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Is something supposed to happen?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… Blat.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh! The Prophet!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, the Prophet!
Blathoxil.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh! Oh! Try “The Lazbo Sandwich”.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t think that’s going to work.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
You could try it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The Lazbo Sandwich.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Thank you.
Silence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Nothing’s happening! We don’t have time for this!
MARIS:
And I’m rifling through the pages and I’m shaking it up and down…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Um, I’m not sure what to do now. I’ve never been alone before. We always have circle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, we can be a little circle.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, thank you. Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I could use your help, Lazbo.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But I’m kind of lost—and you’ve no idea where Mother Speckley could have gone?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, they were here, just an hour ago when I went out to tend the flowers.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, I think I know what I have to do. I have to get this book to Blat.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
To the Chosen One?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
To the Chosen One. So let’s take the book and go through the portal back to where I came from.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay! Open the portal!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you have a bauble? I broke mine.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, I used mine.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
There’s none here?!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I don’t know!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The shiny bauble thing. Isn’t there a storage unit for them? The Shiny Bauble Cupboard?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, Mother Speckley gives them out!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Arggh! Where are they? Have you checked the basement, with the.. the marble pool that turns into water? Have you checked that?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yes, it’s our sandwich preparation area now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. Oookay.
Theme music plays.
ANNOUNCE:
The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy role playing game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your Game Master is Sean Howard, with players Marisa King, Carter Siddall and Michael Howie.
Episode 23: Anywhere and Everywhere.
THE TUNNEL:
SEA:
We shift to darkness. We hear grunting, rocks moving. We hear the dripping of water, muffled and distant, and it smells quite awful. It smells of death and dismemberment.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(grunts with effort)
Just have to get Eggerton free.
CARTE:
And Blat checks to see if there’s any more rubble lying on top of Eggerton.
SEA:
No. Eggerton is fully exposed.
CARTE:
Blat pulls Eggerton free, and checks to see if he’s breathing.
SEA:
He is not.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Alright, Eggsy. I don’t know if this is gonna work. But we’re gonna try something.
Morrigu.
A deep, roiling rumble that fades away to nothing.
SEA:
You feel something fighting against a barrier inside of you—a barrier placed there by another goddess quite recently. And it surges forward. You feel energy start to course through your veins… and then a growing hatred and frustration as it recedes again.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh. Great. I can’t call on Morrigu.
Another brief rumble.
SEA:
And you feel it surge again, and then fade, with even more anger and frustration.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
All right. Let me try something.
Morrigu Morrigu Morrigu Morrigu Morrigu Morrigu Morrigu Morrigu.
The rumbling grows—but fades yet again.
THE FAE LINE:
Tinkling, echoing harp music.
SEA:
Eggerton, you hear music.
And it’s as if you just want to keep sleeping. The music’s getting louder and more insistent.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sleepily)
No, turn it off.
SEA:
And you’ve heard this music before. And it’s getting more insistent and louder until it’s roaring in your ears.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(mumbles)
Okay, I’ll get up, just five more minutes.
SEA:
And when you peek one eye open, you see a door that goes up into the heavens. It is massive. And way, way, way, way high up, written on the door is “The Rolling Scones Bake & Cake”.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Cool.
SEA:
And you suddenly have flashbacks of shells exploding, and a cave-in, and feeling the life leaking out of your body. But you’re here lying on the ground completely intact, as you feel yourself in front of this door, and the music is playing quite loudly from inside.
The harp slowly gives way to a calliope, playing a familiar tune. The pitch wavers drunkenly.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hokay, so I guess, you know, this is just how things go sometimes—you wake up and there’s a door. Uh… looks pretty cool! So you know, maybe I’ll go check out the party.
Hello? Knock knock? Anyone there?
His voice echoes unnaturally.
SEA:
As you approach this door, it slowly shrinks to match your size.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s convenient.
SEA:
And you knock and it swings open.
MIK:
I enter.
The kitchen music suddenly kicks in and speeds up to a madcap tempo.
SEA:
And suddenly you’re in a bowl—a giant mixing bowl.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
SEA:
And you are racing up and over and down and everyone is screaming.
High-pitched screams and laughter.
SEA:
And a fairy cake pops into your mouth and down your gullet. And the bowl banks to the left and everyone screams.
More screams.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Yooo, Eggsy! Dude! It’s good to have you back!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mixing Bowl! It’s been so long.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Yeah! It’s good. You haven’t forgotten anything I taught you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah!
MIK:
(breaks off, laughing)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I‑I spend every night remembering our time together.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Cooool!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It wakes me up at 3 in the morning in a cold sweat. It’s lovely.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Yeah, dude. We’re gonna fly along the fae line! Here comes a good one. A loop-the-loop!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay—
The music accelerates along with the mixing bowl and friends. Screams and laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(screams)
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Oh no, we lost an apple!
(aside)
I never liked the apples, actually.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They can be kind of cranky.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Yeah, totally tubular!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, a little sour—
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Here we go! Going up!
Screams.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
(panting)
This is a good one.
The music starts to slow as the bowl climbs higher.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so we’re at the top of this hill, which means we’re going to stay here, right? We’re not gonna go anywhere else. We’re going to stay right here and have a nice conversation, maybe some peppermint tea.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Whoa, dude.
Halt the ride, everyone!
The music grinds to a halt. Shouts of “whoa!”
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. Whoa, dude, what’s going on, Eggsy?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I don’t know. I mean, I was. I was with my friends. And then there’s, you know, my arm felt bitey. And the number 8 kept floating around in my head for some reason, but then I woke up here!
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
We’re your friends.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! It’s so nice to see you, Strawberry!
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
It’s nice to see you too!
SEAN (AS A SQUEAKY VOICE)
We’re your friends too! Ha ha ha hey!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey! It’s… Pleather Plums!
SEAN (AS PLEATHER PLUMS)
Ha ha! Woo! I’m gonna get in your pocket!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Whoa ha ha, okay! It’s that kind of a party. Cool.
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
They’re very forward, the Pleather Plums.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They are.
SEAN (AS PLEATHER PLUMS)
Are you ticklish?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(giggles uncontrollably)
Well, I don’t know if I’d call that ticklish, but… uh…
Oh, hey, Sugar. It’s nice to see you.
CARTER (AS SUGAR)
Hello! I’m bad for your teeth but good for happiness!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. And that’s that’s what we’re going for! Right? It’s just happiness. No sadness ever!
CARTER (AS SUGAR)
Look! It’s Red Dye Number 5!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right! Now it’s a party.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Dude, why are you stoppin’ the party? We were just starting to rock out on the fae lines!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you know, it just—it was—it was a lot. It felt like a lot and I’ve got this nagging feeling that I forgot to do something.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Whoa, dude.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right? Right? Isn’t it a lot?
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Yeah. Like you forgot to like, eat a fairy cake.
(gasps)
Or do a line of fairy dust!
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
Or brush your teeth?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, that definitely wasn’t it.
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
Oh.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Make your bed?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no. Um…
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
I’ve got nothing.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Or tie your shoe.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(smacks his lips)
Why does everything taste dusty?
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Ohhhh! It’s because you died!
Manic laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait, wait, wait, wait…
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Whoa whoa whoa, halt the ride, halt the ride.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, wait.
You all died?
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
No!
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
No, no, no. You. You died.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I—no, because I’m here!
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Yeah, and we’re riding the fae lines!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, but see, I’m here. So I’m not dead. Because I’m here. I’m—I’m engaged with reality. So clearly, I’m alive still!
CARTER (AS SUGAR)
I’m talking sugar. This is not reality.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
I’m a giant mixing bowl you’re inside of. And we’re hovering in the air over a fae line.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so I see your point. But. I feel like we’re doing a lot of inductive reasoning right now. And if you really want me to get on board this line of yours, you need to get some evidence piled up.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
A line! Get a line of fairy dust going!
Screams and woohoos.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
That’ll make you feel better, Eggsy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, I… Okay, so what you’re saying is I am no longer alive. But I’m alive. But I’m not alive.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Well, your body is dead right now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
My body is dead. That’s not a lot of fun, though. I mean, I—it was a little slow, but I kind of liked that body.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Oh, yeah, no. It’s not your time. we’re gonna send you back.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s nice of you!
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
We’re gonna do the ride. But you keep stopping the ride.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Well, if we’re just gonna ride for a bit and then I get to go back, then yeah. Let’s party!
Jubilant screams.
THE TUNNEL:
SEA:
We return to Blat in the darkness, and he is dripping with sweat. His face, that you can’t see, contorted in effort. And there is an energy in the room, a buzzing sound you can almost hear—but Morrigu cannot break the bonds holding her.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(gritted teeth)
I can’t believe that the one time I want to call Morrigu, nothing happens.
Loxsyn! Break the bond. Loxsyn.
Loxsyn?
SEA:
Nothing happens.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(groans and gasps)
SEA:
Though you do hear a sound coming from down the corridor, as if there’s a conversation happening… just leaking through the gaps in the stones that you have freed in uncovering Eggerton’s body.
CARTE:
So Blat, dripping in sweat, tiptoes over and places a pointed ear against the wall.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
(big and slow)
I got a 3 of clubs.
(chuckles)
Beat that.
MIKE (AS SECOND BIG VOICE)
(also big and slow)
I’ve got a full dungeon.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Wha? Goh! Oh, rust it!
MIKE (AS GOH, THE SECOND BIG VOICE)
Well, that’s why you don’t bet your scabbard unless you’re willing to lose it, man.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
You cheating again?
MIKE (AS GOH)
I’m not cheating! You just don’t know the rules. Look, I’ve got a 2, a crown, an anchor and a 3. That’s all full dungeon.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
I’m done with this game.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Well gimme your scabbard and go back to your mama.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
(petulant)
Fine. Here’s my scabbard.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Thank you. I’m gonna put it up here on the wall.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
It’s empty anyways.
MIKE (AS GOH)
(gasps)
You cheat!
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Heh heh. You didn’t say the sword in it.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Well, it’s implied. You don’t say, hey, give me all of your coin purses and then be like, but first empty them of coins. No. No, you just give people the coin purse.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
You didn’t ask for my coin purse! You asked for my scabbard!
MIKE (AS GOH)
It’s an analogy, dammit!
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Oh, you and your analo-whatevers.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, I’ll say it again. A metaphor is comparing two different things.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
A simile is comparing two different things using “like” or “as”.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
But that’s the same thing! I don’t understand.
MIKE (AS GOH)
(with growing outrage)
One of them is more specific than—you know what? We’re fighting this one out again!
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Bring it!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Here we go! Table flip!
A table flips with a crash. They both roar.
MIK:
(begins coughing violently)
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Are you okay?
MIKE (AS GOH)
(spluttering)
I’m good. I’m good.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Okay, let me know when you’re ready to fight.
Goh takes a few breaths to work himself back up, then both of them roar once again.
TEMPLE IDRI:
SEA:
We return to temple Idris, and we see Darcy stepping out of the large doors and staring outward, holding a book. And Lazbo comes stumbling out behind her.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay! I got all the—well, a lot of sandwiches. Do you want to carry a couple of the sandwiches?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ll take some sandwiches, Lazbo, but I don’t know—it’s going to take forever to get to this place without a portal! Are there any hidden portals around here?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Well, I found the horseradish.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How is the horseradish gonna help us?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Well, I don’t know. But I looked! All I found was horseradish. Oh! And we’re making special mustard, ever since Eggerton showed us how.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(impatient)
That’s great, Lazbo. We’re in a bit of trouble, though? So I need you to focus on a way to get us back to where I was, which was Celene’s icy palace place.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Wait, we’re going to Celene’s?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, yeah! That’s where Eggerton and the Chosen One are.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, I didn’t know that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We have to go into the lion’s den, Lazbo.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We have to go deep into the heart of darkness.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay, I’m gonna go get a weapon.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s a good idea! Get a few weapons! Get lots of weapons.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I’ll be right back!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, great.
(sighs)
SEA:
And your amulet starts to light up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sarcastic)
This is great. Great, Loxsyn, this is really helpful. You keep lighting me up, but you don’t actually give me any light to see what I need to do. This book is doing nothing! I can’t get back to Blat! I can’t get back to Eggerton!
(miserable)
I don’t know what to do, and you just gave me one Slaad who enjoys making sandwiches and putting horseradish in them. I… I’m about ready to give up.
SEA:
You hear a whisper, as if on the wind, Darcy. And at first you think it says “Cheesecake”. But as it repeats a few times, you catch it saying “Ego plebium”.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What…
(gasps)
That’s it. That’s the phrase! Oh thank Loxsyn! Thank you thank you thank you!
Ego plebium!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay, I got the weap…
Darcy?
Oh, maybe she went inside.
(shouts)
Darcy? Are you inside?
THE FAE LINE:
The cartoonish kitchen music starts up again, faster than ever.
SEA:
We return to the party!
A cheer goes up among the kitchen items.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look! A shooting star that’s a rainbow too!
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
It’s a double rainbow!
More cheering.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Now, Eggy, we’re coming to the end of the journey.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aww.
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
Aww.
The music gradually slows to a crawl.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait, wait—
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
You’re gonna have to get off, or otherwise… you’re never gonna get off the ride, Eggy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aww. Wait. Wait wait wait wait wait. I have to get off the ride of life? Or I have to get off this ride and go back to life because that was a little unclear.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Exactly, dude.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, that checks out. That tracks.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Remember, you can travel the fae line any time, as I’ve told you over and over!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I can travel the fae line! I’m glad that you told me that without any context. Thank you.
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
Here we go! We’re approaching the end light!
The music starts to accelerate again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right! Everyone hold on!
MARISA (AS STRAWBERRY)
Bye, Eggerton!
SEAN (AS THE MIXING BOWL)
No, Eggy, you have to jump off!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Everyone let go, I’m jumping!
Screams.
THE TUNNEL:
SEA:
We return to the darkness, where Blat has his ear pressed up against a crack in the stones. And a bit of light is leaking through, allowing him to see for the first time. And he’s catching what looks like movement in a room on the far—just on the other side of this caved-in mess.
Distant muttering and shouting.
CARTE:
And Blat puts his lips up against the hole, and slowly and carefully says,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
There appears to be a scabbard back here.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Hey! Wait—stop it for a second.
MIKE (AS GOH)
No, I—
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
I heard something. Let go of my head!
MIKE (AS GOH)
No, you let go of my toe first.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
We’re going to let go together, okay?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, on three.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
One… two—
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Wait, I already did it.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, well, now I win. Ha ha ha! I win!
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Hey, come on!
MIKE (AS GOH)
I win!
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
No, I swear I heard—didn’t you hear that? Quiet.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Well, I heard you cry like a big baby…
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Shut up. Shut up. Quiet. Listen.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, two scabbards. There are two scabbards back here.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Nope, didn’t hear anything. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
No, I swear I heard something. I swear I heard—
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, okay, okay. Quiet.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Okay, quiet, quiet.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Definitely three scabbards.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
No, you’re right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, it’s nothing.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It’s the wind. Just the wind. Okay, all right, well, let go now, you won.
MIKE (AS GOH)
All right, I win.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Fine. Here’s my scabbard..
MIKE (AS GOH)
Thanks.
(mutters)
Stupid scabbard without a sword.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
I’m not playing cards with you anymore.
MIKE (AS GOH)
I don’t wanna play cards with you anyway.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
I’m gonna go over here by this wall and just sulk.
MIKE (AS GOH)
All right, I’m gonna—I’m gonna go in this corner and twiddle my thumbs and look down and not pay attention to anything really that’s outside of my direct field of vision.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Hey, there didn’t used to be a wall here, did there? That’s weird.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Well, you know, they’re always redecorating.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Yeah, that’s true. Celene.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, they ever since they started you know, playing that magic “does it bring you joy” thing, people just keep adding things and throwing stuff down here. It’s really rude.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
You said that like a Red.
MIKE (AS GOH)
A… what? What?
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
What? We did the personality—you’re a Red, I’m a Green.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, right, right, right! Thought you were talking about my mother.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Why would I be talking about—
MIKE (AS GOH)
That’s just a—are you calling my mother red?!
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Ha ha, I might be now.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, that’s it! This is happening!
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Oh yeah? Come on!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Table flip!
The table flips again. They roar.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
There’s no table left. Ha ha ha.
MIKE (AS GOH)
I flipped it anyway.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Okay.
I’m gonna go back over by this corner.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh yeah, twiddle thumbs.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
Blat! What are you doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat! What are we listening to?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Eggsy?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, what are we doing?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I thought you were dead!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Nope, not dead.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
A very large amount of rocks fell on you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Don’t remember that!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Do you know what I was about to do?! I was trying to call Morrigu so Morrigu could possess your body so that you could stay alive!
I was going to sacrifice you to Morrigu so that you wouldn’t die! But now you just woke up!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I—thank you? I think?
I mean, it’s sweet of you…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now we’re at the end of the tunnel. I hear two morons on the other side of this, who apparently are distracted at the moment after fighting for absolutely no reason.
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Did you hear that?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Hear what?
SEAN (AS FIRST BIG VOICE)
No, it was nothing.
MIKE (AS GOH)
All right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, do you want to see a cool new trick I learned? I was on a roller coaster. Watch this! Ready? Ready?
(grunts with effort)
Hrnggh—!
A popping sound.
SEA:
And Eggsy disappears.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What the hell is…?!
(mutters)
Should have sacrificed him to Morrigu, is what I should have done.
(mocking)
Ooo, Loxsyn has to come in—Loxsyn doesn’t allow me to talk to Morrigu anymore. Now I could have gotten rid of this stupid voice, to have Eggerton try the voice for a while. But now he apparently can come back from the dead and has special disappearing powers! And—
Wait a second. Don’t I have special disappearing powers?
THE FORGOTTEN PLANE:
Pounding, trashy metal guitar and drums.
SEA:
Darcy is tumbling head over heels, down, down through layers and layers of rock and earth and molten lava.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Aaaaa!
SEA:
And suddenly pops into the Forgotten Planes. The world here is grey and red, with pockets of magma bubbling up and little bits of rocky ground interspersed in the magma.
And striding forward is a ten-foot tall, entirely blood-red demon with an eight-foot axe materializing in his hand.
SEAN (AS REGINALD THE DEMON)
(roars with laughter)
Ha ha! This is gonna be fun!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Aaaaaaaa!
MIDROL:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s… the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey, everyone, Sean here. We’re back. And wow, does it feel good to finally be back. Thank you all so much for your patience. And it’s time for some midroll shout outs!
But first, I want to give a shout out to the Reckless Play Guild on Facebook where you can join a bunch of us that have all come together in an amazing Facebook group that is just so much fun. So we’ve got ourselves in there, Dumbgeons and Dragons, Dark Dice and The Lucky Die all in there. And it’s truly amazing—interviews happening, all kinds of fun stuff.
And speaking of Dumbgeons and Dragons… you may want to listen to Episode 83, because it is the grand finale of, I believe it’s been five years they’ve been playing this one arc—three years on mic… and a certain individual got to play Tiamat! That’s all I’m gonna say! It rhymes with me!
Yeah, it wasn’t very subtle, was it? It was super fun. I highly recommend it. But don’t start there. You gotta listen, you gotta catch up—83 episodes. Super fun. I really love that show.
Let’s do some shout outs. Let’s start with our old timers, the people who have been with us for so long and never gotten a shout out and I’m slowly working through the backlog. So first on the list is Ben Gidalevich. So sorry if I pronounce any of these wrong—I’m trying so hard. Joe Wreschnig, Britta Olofsson and Josh Clavir. Big hearts to all four of you and everyone else who is listening. You are all so special to us.
And because we’ve been off the air for a while we have a long list of new patrons to read, which is so cool! The first one is a handle, aspoonie500—then we have Bart Schuurmans, then Travis Love, Nikki Bennett, Victoria Snyder, Gwen May, Katie, Toby Zitsman, Tara Brannen. Amanda Miller, Ellen Ros—I assume that’s not Ross from the show I know—And Aaron Boyd. Thank you all so much. We really appreciate your love and all your support. And without any further ado, let’s get back to it.
Music sting.
MIDROLL: INTRODUCING…
SEA:
Oh, hey. Hey, Marisa? Oh, Carter, you’re here too. Cool. Hey, I need to introduce you to our new cast member. You know since Eggerton’s dead. Um, so this is Samantha.
MARIS:
Oh, okay.
CARTE:
Samantha?
MARIS:
Hi, Samantha.
MIK:
(in an absurd falsetto)
Hello. How are you?
CARTE:
Uh, good… I thought we came up with an idea to explain why Eggerton isn’t dead. Because he had like, 8 hit points.
SEA:
Yeah.
CARTE:
Before the roof caved in.
SEA:
Yeah.
CARTE:
So he’s not really dead. I think maybe he was like, knocked unconscious or something.
SEA:
Yeah. Well, you know, it leaked that he had 8 hit points and the fan base sort of was like… basically revolted. And basically we’re losing viewers, so the producers made a call, said he’s out and we’re… now we have Samantha.
MIK:
Hello! I’m Samantha.
MARIS:
You look really familiar, Samantha.
MIK:
I get that all the time. It’s because I have kind eyes.
MARIS:
And you wear flannel too.
MIK:
I—sometimes, sometimes. I find it’s very warm on cool days.
MARIS:
So what character are you going to play, Samantha?
MIK:
Oh, I’m gonna play Smeggerton.
MARIS:
(skeptical)
Uh-huh.
MIK:
Yeah.
MARIS:
What kind of character is Smeggerton?
MIK:
Smeggerton is a very aggressive, mean spirited fae.
MARIS:
Hmmmm.
MIK:
Who always saves the day.
MARIS:
Mm hmm.
CARTE:
It’s Mike.
SEA:
(whispers)
Aw, goddammit, Carter!
MIK:
I don’t know what you’re talking about! How dare you!
SEA:
Michael, they know it’s you.
MIK:
I don’t know what you’re talking about! I’m Samantha! I’m new!
MARIS:
But if you go to patreon.com and check out our Patreon page, maybe we could make Mike talk like that for a whole episode.
MIK:
I bet it’s patreon.com/albasalix.
MARIS:
Thank you.
MIK:
Or if you go to otherbothers.com you can find—see, I’m already fitting in!
MARIS:
Samantha, you really helped out there. Thank you.
SEA:
You’re welcome,
Music sting.
PARADO:
Forest birds twitter in the distance.
SEA:
We return to a clearing with large and cracked fae stone in the centre of it. And with a popping sound, Eggerton appears, standing on top of the fae stone just outside of Paradox.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So cool!
I was there! And then I went, hnngh! And that sound happened. And then I was here!
SEA:
A bunny rabbit screams and runs off into the forest.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay, bunny! I’m a natural part of the ecosystem like you! Don’t be afraid!
Oh, well. Okay, so where am I? I need to get my bearings. Uh… wait, wait, wait. Are there any female eagles?
Yup, there’s one! Okay. I’m near Paradox. I know where I am.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Hi Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
Cyrus!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I didn’t expect to see you here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Give me a hug, buddy!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
No, that’s okay—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aw, there it is! Bring it in!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
That’s—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You’re not gonna believe the day I’ve been having.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Are we done hugging now?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, yeah. Okay, there you go. Good job. Um. So here’s the thing. Um. How’s the Nexus holding up?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
You pretty much destroyed it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
When you say “you” do you mean “you” me? Or do you mean “you” Darcy and I was there?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I’m not sure the distinction matters.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, it matters. Trust me, it’s going to come up later. Okay, okay. It’s fine. It’s fine. So. Is there anyone left in Paradox? Because there’s a bit of a problem with Celene and Loxsyn and this other goddess whose name I’m not allowed to say.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Uh, yeah most of Paradox is still there, I’m sad to say.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are you sad about that?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I appear to still have my job.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And that makes you sad?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
It does.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You know what? I think every day you should find three things to be joyful about, Cyrus.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
You know what would make me joyful?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What would make you joyful?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
If you could get my book back from Darcy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s not happening.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s gone. That’s so long gone.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I should have known.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m pretty she made some pirate hats out of some of the pages. Then she might have used some to line like a birdcage or something…
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
(sighs)
Can I help you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes! Three things, right now, Cyrus, that you’re joyful about. Let’s hear ’em.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Okay. Um. Somebody appeared on the fae stone.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
One!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
The fae stone is still here and not destroyed.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Two!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I wasn’t killed in the pandemonium.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Three! That’s amazing. Okay, let’s—
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I’m not sure if the last one makes me feel good, though.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, that’s sad. But you know, it’s okay to be sad sometimes!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Really?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. All feelings are good feelings!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
That actually makes me feel a little better.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m glad. Now Cyrus, let’s go check out Paradox. Might need to raise an army. Um. War of three goddesses happening. Don’t know what happened to Darcy. Jacqueline still missing. Jill still missing. Haven’t heard from Ananka. Haven’t heard from Lady Speckley. Haven’t heard from Moira. Blat’s been taken over by a few different people and talks funny now. I think it’s bothering his throat.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Yeah. I actually have a—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do we have any lozenges, by the way? I bet he would love a lozenge. Let’s pick up some lozenges at the store.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I forgot how joyous you are.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Then we’re going to go and find out what’s going on. Then we’re going to raise an army of good…
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I’ll just be over here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Then we’re going to go forward into the future and fight for what is right and pure and lovely and happy and—where’d you go?
Oh, there you are! Okay, let’s go into town!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Actually, Eggerton, I have a message for you from Moira.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Why didn’t you say so?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
(sighs)
She says, don’t ever show your face in Paradox again. Or she will kill you.
Silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She’s probably just joking around. Let’s go into town!
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Okay, I’ll take you to town. But the school’s not there anymore.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh. Like it… when you say it’s not there, do you mean like, it’s crumbled or like, it’s gone?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
It’s gone.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, wow. That must have been quite the effort to move it.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I believe it was.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Huh.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I believe there were a few expletives in the message I was supposed to tell you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I bet there were. She’s very passionate person.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
She is.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Want a fairy cake?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
No, but thank you. If you want, I can take you into Paradox but there’s not much there right now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, we definitely need to pick up some sparkles. So let’s go into town, get a couple of supplies. Then you can come back with me and we’ll go save the day.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
All right, come this way.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right.
THE FORGOTTEN PLANE:
A low rumble of flames.
SEA:
We return to bubbling magma and smoke stinging the eyes of Darcy, who’s blinking rapidly as a ten-foot demon charges forward towards her with a roar.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Raaaargh!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait! Stop! Stop! Why are you running at me?!
SEA:
And the axe cleaves Darcy in two—
and Darcy rematerializes in a world of smoke and ash and bubbling magma. Standing whole again.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wha…?!
SEA:
As a ten-foot demon spins, laughs—
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Ha ha ha! That was too easy. Call your weapon!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What is happening?! I don’t understand what’s going on!
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Wait.
What are you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m—I’m a human?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
What are you doing here?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know! I—I… there was a book and it was Blat’s book and I said “ego plebium” and I was suddenly here. I don’t even know where I am.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Did you say Blat?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat? Do you know Blat?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Of course. Blat and I go, well, pretty far back. We’ve been training together. He’s been improving pretty remarkably.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! You’re—you’re his trainer person!
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry for cleaving you in two. I just don’t see too many people. Got a little excited, thought I had a new student.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, I guess it happens sometimes.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah. Oh. Please, come over. Would you like some tea?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
Yes. I would.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Here, I’ll just set the table.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you so much.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Have a seat. I’ll just lean my axe over.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, that’s—
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
What do you like in your team?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… really nothing. But is it peppermint tea? I like peppermint tea, or chamomile?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I have chamomile.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ohh, chamomile is great. Yeah.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Here we go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, thank you. This is… oh, I can tell you how good this feels. I haven’t felt this calm in a long time now. But just knowing that, you know, Blat, and you’re a big ten-foot demon. That makes me feel so good, because I bet you could just come and save us all and it’ll be fine.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Uh, I can’t leave the book.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Well, unless you wanted to trade places with me and live forever in the book as a teacher but I… since you’re not a demon, I don’t know how you could do that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Would I have to cleave people in half?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Oh, yes. Ha ha, it’s really the best part of the job.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I don’t really do that too often.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Oh. Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So you can’t leave here.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
It’s a bit one-note, I get it. But it is fun. Um, no, no, I’m just a teacher. It’s just the book.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So can you help me? You see Blat and Eggerton—do you know Eggerton?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Oh, yes. Blat’s talked about him quite a bit. Okay. Yeah.
Oh wait, you’re that Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m the Darcy, yeah! Yeah.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Oh! Oh.
(clears his throat)
I mean, yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(suddenly awkward)
Oh, well. Yeah, no, I… we don’t talk about—it’s fine.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
No, it’s all—I didn’t mean to bring anything up—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, no, it’s just—we don’t bring—anyway! Oh, chamomile tea.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah! Look, have a cookie.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Good. Oh, thanks—that’s so good. But—
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
They’re a little charred. It’s just the temperature.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, ha ha, thanks. I’ll take anything right now.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
We don’t really cook them. I just put the dough out. And it cooks on the plate.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, it’s very hot here.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So the problem is that Eggerton and Blat are in a lot of trouble. See, they’re going up against a goddess, and I was supposed to help them. But then we got separated, we always get separated for some reason. And then I came back to the tree to try and find the Slaad and Mother Speckley, but they’re not there, and that’s when the book came. And that’s why I’m here… but I don’t know what to do now.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah. That was a lot really fast.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sorry.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah. I don’t think—you should tell Blat he’s not ready to take on a goddess, when you see him, but
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But he’s taking on the goddess now.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah, no, he shouldn’t do that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. That’s what we thought—
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I mean, it’s a goddess.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But he’s very bullheaded. And it doesn’t help but he’s been possessed by a different goddess—
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
He gets that from me a little.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Who’s very angry and makes him angry.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Oh yeah, I can understand that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So you see, he’s not the Blat you knew, I don’t think. He’s been possessed.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Well, I don’t think you should make those judgments. I mean, just because, you know, we like some art on the side and like to get angry doesn’t mean that that defines us, right?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. Okay, um, I’m just saying that… Do you know who could help me? Or, or…
Wait. I guess if you’re a teacher, you would know about the Academy of the Fallen?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Well, yes, I work for the Academy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, so it must be fine! If you’re a teacher and you’re teaching… I bet it’s fine! And everyone’s fine and I didn’t do anything wrong—
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Why wouldn’t the Academy be fine?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, when I left it, there was a lot of destruction going on…
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And… death.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How would you not know about this?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I’m in a book.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How do you get your paycheques?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I don’t. I live in this book.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, don’t they send things to the book?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Well, yeah. They haven’t sent anything in a while…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think this is a really one-sided job you’ve got going on here.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah. It’s got its perks. I mean…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You should renegotiate.
Anyway, that’s not the point! The point is, you don’t know? You haven’t heard from them?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Okay, start from the beginning.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Just start slow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Here, I’ll pour some more tea.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
So let’s start with the whole goddess thing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
About Blat?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. So Blat’s been possessed by a goddess called—I think I can say it here…
(whispers)
Morrigu.
THE TUNNEL:
SEA:
We return to the partial darkness, where Blat is slowly moving stones out of the fallen wall, and exposing more and more light of the chamber on the other side, where a couple unusual, icy-looking creatures are relaxing, and each reading a magazine.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, whatever these guys are, they don’t hear very well. I’ll just see if I can take them out one at a time.
CARTE:
And Blat steps out from the small hole that he’s created, out into the hall, and walks towards the first magazine-reading guard.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Hey, Goh. Did you see the article on the the Ice Capades?
MIKE (AS GOH THE ICE ZOMBIE)
Yeah! It looks like it’s gonna be awesome this year. They got Brian Boitano.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Oh, wait. Did you hear that?
MIK:
(laughs)
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Brian Cattano? Really?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, Brian Cattano.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Oh my God!
SEA:
Okay, so Blat, as you’re approaching, they are utterly oblivious to you. They are coated in ice, almost look zombie-like, and each of them is reading a magazine with their back to you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, let’s try a different approach.
CARTE:
And Blat taps on the shoulder of the one closest to him.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Huh? Just a minute I’m—sorry, wait. Goh?
MIKE (AS GOH)
What?
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Are you behind me?
MIKE (AS GOH)
No, I’m taking this relationship quiz. Did you know that you’re like a scorpion?
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Really?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah. I think like, we need to bring this up in circle.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Okay, but someone—if you’re there…
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
And you didn’t tap me…
MIKE (AS GOH)
No.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Oh, God. Is Celene standing right behind me?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Let me look. No, not Celene.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Oh. Whew.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, that would be scary.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Ha ha, man.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Ha ha!
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Whooo!
MIKE (AS GOH)
We would have been in trouble!
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Oh, my God, reading a magazine!
MIKE (AS GOH)
If Celine came in, I’m doing—you know what? You know what? I actually circled a recipe that I thought she might like, but I was like, no, I’ll never give that to her.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
No, don’t.
MIKE (AS GOH)
No, she doesn’t accept that kind of stuff.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
No, not from us.
MIKE (AS GOH)
It’s very rude.
Silence.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sorry, I got a little turned around back in the hallway.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Could you tell me how to get to Celene?
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Oh! Uh…
SEA:
One of the guards gets up, throwing down the magazine.
SEAN (AS FIRST ICE ZOMBIE)
Oh.
(clears throat)
I am Rothkar… and thou shalt not trespass here!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just need to see Celene real quick.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR THE ICE ZOMBIE)
Okay, just keep going down the path.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, yeah. You know what, she likes to go up two storeys.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Up two.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah. And then to the right, like not the first—
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
(whispers)
No, we’re not supposed to tell anyone where she is. We’re supposed to, like…
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, we’re just supposed to direct. You know what, this is what happens when you don’t have representation at the management level.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
I know. I keep saying we should have a union.
MIKE (AS GOH)
We should. Okay. You know what? When I finish—
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
The circle’s not working.
MIKE (AS GOH)
No, the circle’s not working. That’s some silly idea from the woods. When I’m done the Sudoku puzzle, we’re going to sit down, we’re going to write up a charter and we’re going to present it—you’re going to present it to Celene.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
All right, but who’s going to be foreman?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, well…
(considers for a long while)
You know what?!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah?
MIKE (AS GOH)
I’m foreman!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah? No, I’m—!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Table flip!
Roaring and struggling.
SEA:
So Blat, the two ice zombies start to fight and wrestle off to the side, leaving the passage clear forward.
CARTE:
Blat takes a few steps down the hall, turns around, looks at the two of them still fighting and thinks,
CARTER (AS BLAT)
What the hell. I need some help. I’m going to try something.
CARTE:
And walks to the two of them rolling around on the ground, punching each other.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
I got your toe!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Aw, no, not my toe. Awww, darn it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So, uh… scary news.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh? Yeah?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Uh?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I heard that Celene isn’t the real Celene but, um, an evil clone.
MIKE (AS GOH)
What?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
What?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So. Who wants to help me kill it?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah! Oh my God. Celene will be so angry someone’s cloning her!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, we’re going to get—this is how we get the leverage for the union!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh my god. I’m bringing back her head.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, that’s a good—okay, I’m gonna bring back both her big toes.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh ho ho! Look at us, we’re working together, ’cause we’re a union!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
All right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Let’s do this.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
All right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Put down the empty scabbard and pick up the sword.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh, that’s a good point.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah. Let’s get the swords.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Thanks Goh.
MIKE (AS GOH)
All right. Let’s go.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Rothkar’s got the sword. Oh wait, what’s your name?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh. My name’s Blathoxil.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Nice to meet you. Blathoxil.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Blathoxil.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Blathoxil.
They carry on trying out the name.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You guys can just call me Blat.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Blat.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh, that’s great. That’s actually helpful.
MIKE (AS GOH)
I like that. Blat. Blat Blat Blat.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay. Which way?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, I thought you guys—
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh, yeah! We know! Ha ha ha.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh yeah. I’ll go first because I’m the leader.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Hey.
MIKE (AS GOH)
What?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Let’s go together.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh! Good idea. Arm in arm.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Brothers in arm.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
All right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay. Okay, wait, no, there’s a doorway. Okay, let’s turn sideways, and I’ll go through first.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Hey.
MIKE (AS GOH)
What?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
All right, but I’m going through first, the next one.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, that works, that works. We’ll take turns. Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This is gonna be one hell of a union meeting.
PARADO:
SEA:
We return later in the day to the half grown-over road leading back to the fae stone, as they enter the clearing, Cyrus in the lead, and Eggerton tottering behind with a giant bag full of glitter and cakes and food from town.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, they weren’t quite as friendly as I expected, that I’ll say that much.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Your poster is all over town, as I said.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes. And my disguise of putting my finger below my nose as a moustache was not effective.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Though it was fun to watch.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It was. And at the end of the day, if an entire community hates you, you might as well have fun.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Yeah, well, here you are, back to the fae stone.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, look, Cyrus, I’m glad that you came on an adventure with me, that you got to see why it matters to have different types of sprinkles and sparkles and glitters.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
And why it matters to not have an entire town hate you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Mm hmm. It was very informative.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yes, it worked out nicely as a lesson plan.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I’ll take these feathers. I don’t think the tar is coming off.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, no, I’m going to need to get in the lake. But thanks! I mean, I think you could probably take some of the feathers and put them behind your ears.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I’ll consider it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. Well, look, you remember that sometimes it’s okay to be sad. And that it’s okay to take a break. And to find happiness in the little things.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Mm hmm. I’ll ponder that, Eggsy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. And if you see any weird little Irish birds, say hi for me.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
I will do so.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right. Now I’m going to just—you know, I don’t really know what the best way to get back onto the fae stone is, to get on the fae lines but—okay.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Here, I’ll help. Give me your—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you know, just pick—can you just grab me?
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Look, just put your—what are you doing? Ugh—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, and then—
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
What are you doing? You don’t need to get—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, there we go! All right! Now I’m going to stand on your shoulders—
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
Agh! My nose. My nose.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, now I’m going to jump off of you like a diving board, right into an elegant dive.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
What? Maybe I should brace… I’m really not ready for this.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ready? On three! One—two—three—hup!
MIK:
And Eggerton does a belly flop onto the fae stone, and with a pop, disappears.
SEAN (AS CYRUS)
But you forgot all the… food.
THE FORGOTTEN PLANE:
SEA:
We return to the Forgotten Planes—magma and smoke—and come down to a tiny bit of earth floating in magma, with a tea set on it, as Darcy finishes telling her story.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And then that’s how I finally got here, and you cleaved me in two and then you offered me tea. And that’s how we got here.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I see now. Hmm. So the Goddess is inside of him, bonded with him.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. I think so.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Interesting. He hasn’t visited me in some time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s probably why.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
There’s a chance if he visited me, Morrigu may not be able to follow.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh!
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Because we’re able to say the word here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s true. And nothing happened!
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, so do you think if I can get the book to Blat… maybe he could come to you and that would fix everything?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Well, the second he leaves, he’d be rebonded, but he could stay here with me for a while. You know, we could talk through old plays or, you know, maybe he could bring a book.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But I don’t think he’d want to stay here forever.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
No, I understand that.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But maybe while he’s here with you, we could figure out a way to get rid of… Morrigu. Sorry, that name just makes me really nervous.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I understand. Yeah. I can send you back. But where did you come from?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, uh, Temple Idris. Do you know that? With the tree?
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I know of Temple Idris. Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So that’s where I was. But I don’t want to get back there. I need to get back to where I was with Blat and Eggerton, which was Celene’s ice palace. And I don’t know if you know where that is.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Is the book there?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, right, the book is at Temple Idris.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
So that’s where I can send you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So I have to get back there. But then how do I get from there to Blat? Because they don’t have their shiny baubles, and there’s no teleportation there.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I don’t know, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sorry, I expect you to have all the answers just because I really need someone to have all the answers.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
I can give you some cookies to go.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, I’ll take some for Lazbo.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Okay. Here. The ones you like.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Thank you very much. It was really nice to see you. You are a comforting presence in an otherwise… turmoil world.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
(touched)
Really? That means so much to me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, well, it was really nice to meet you.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Please, come again anytime. I’ll try to watch and not cleave you in two.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, that would be great. Because I feel like you come on with a really strong greeting that isn’t always positive to visitors.
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
Yeah, ha ha, well, it’s sort of my thing.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, got it. Sometimes we have to stick with our thing. Anyway, I better get back because I have no idea what’s going on. And thank you for everything!
SEAN (AS REGINALD)
You’re welcome. Darcy Good luck and… yeah, good luck.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How do I leave?
SEA:
And he snaps his fingers.
THE TUNNEL:
SEA:
We are walking down an icy tunnel—ice on all sides, a little slick to walk on—that is slowly widening. And ahead of Blat walk two ice zombies, arm in arm. And ahead of all of them is a reinforced rock and steel door set in the dead end that they now approach.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay, so I guess the fake Celene is on the other side of this. Oh, but how are we going to know if it’s the fake Celene or the real Celene?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, I bet we should ask her a riddle.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh, that’s good. That’s good, Goh.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Right.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah, that’s good. Okay, do you know a riddle?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Uhhhh…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh, let’s ask Blat.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Blat? Blat?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, actually, the riddle would be… we shouldn’t be able to kill Celene. So if we’re able to kill Celene, that’s the fake Celene.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
And she’s a witch!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yes. It all checks out.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Right. Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
So if we can kill her… that’s the fake.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That’s right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, you know what I just remembered? Last month they had a feature on how to kill a witch in the magazine. We shoulda brought it with us!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Aw, come on. Really?
MIKE (AS GOH)
We’re so afraid of real Celene that we left our magazines behind even though the magazines have the way we’re going to defeat the fake Celene and earned the real Celene’s trust. Anyway, how we going to get through this door?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So neither of you know how to get through this door.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh no, Star does.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Star does.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah, Star.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Who is Star? Where is Star?
SEAN (AS STAR)
(high-pitched voice)
I’m Star!
MIKE (AS GOH)
And the sound of the voice is coming from very high up, and it’s a very tinny, tiny voice. And looking up, you see floating in the air, a four-inch tall, what you might call a pixie, with shimmering pink wings and emerald eyes and green skin.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Star? I was wondering if you could open this door for us.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Ha ha, sure! Not a problem! Once you’re dead.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I… see. So you don’t want to be part of the union.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Wait, there’s a union?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh yeah, the union! Okay, so here’s the deal. We’re gonna get together—
SEAN (AS STAR)
Oh, you’re organizing without me? I’m just at the end of the hall!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, well, we were coming to see you right now! Because we couldn’t do this without you, obviously. So what’s going to happen is we’re going to kill a fake Celene. We’re going to leverage—
SEAN (AS STAR)
What?!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, there’s a fake Celene. We’re going to kill the fake Celene—
SEAN (AS STAR)
Goh, you’re an idiot.
MIKE (AS GOH)
What are you talking about? This nice demon man told us that there is a fake Celene. We’re gonna kill the fake Celene, earn the real Celene’s trust and use that to leverage unionization, because management without representation is mismanagement.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Goh, you’re an idiot.
What’s your name, sir?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I am Blathoxil.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Blathoxil… wait, let me check.
SEA:
And she pulls out out of nowhere this giant stream of paper.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Blathoxil. Blathoxil. There’s so many people on the kill list! Blathoxil, Blathoxil… nope.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, did you look under “Blat”? He goes by Blat too.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Oh, wait. Blat… Blat… No. Oh, wait, here you are!
No, you can go through.
Well, that’s no fun.
MIKE (AS GOH)
All right, let’s go. I think we can all fit through this door three abreast, too. It’s pretty big.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Goh, are you really that much of an idiot?
MIKE (AS GOH)
What are you talking about?
SEAN (AS STAR)
Fine. Yeah. Go kill the fake Celene.
MIKE (AS GOH)
All right. Why don’t you come with us?
SEAN (AS STAR)
Ha ha, yeah, no, I’ll just I’ll stay here. Have fun, guys.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Good luck!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Let’s go.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
We should try, though, to gather as many people as possible to get in on this union idea.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, yeah, let’s put out a general notice. We’ll put it up on the walls. We can have an AGM next week. We’ll have some tea there—iced tea, obviously. And we’ll get together we’ll talk about it, we’ll write the charter, we’ll get some points down on paper. And then you can go present it to Celene.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But the first meeting should be killing the fake Celene.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Hmmm. Good point. Good point. So who else is in the castle that we can we can bring in on this?
SEAN (AS STAR)
Really, Goh. Why don’t I just open the door for you, Goh? Here, I’ll just open this—
SEA:
And she flies down and starts pulling open this giant door, as if it was effortless.
A massive creaking sound.
MIKE (AS GOH)
They’re very strong.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So I see.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Yeah, so um, good luck with your recruitment! Fake Celene is in there, maybe she’ll join your union.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Well, no, see, we’re going to kill fake Celene—
SEAN (AS STAR)
Uh huh.
MIKE (AS GOH)
To gain the trust of older Celene—or real Celene.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Right. Yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
And then real Celene is going to trust us. We can use that to leverage unionization because management without representation is mismanagement.
SEAN (AS STAR)
(over Goh)
What was your name? Blathox…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Blathoxil. I’m the uh… union representative.
SEAN (AS STAR)
You’re good. You’re really good. Been nice knowing you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Last chance. I think if you came with us, there’s probably a raise, and dental in your future.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Ha ha.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, dental?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Dental.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Really.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Full dental.
MIKE (AS GOH)
‘Cause I was crunching on an ice cube the other day and I feel like I—here, look, I feel like I cracked this back molar—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, that’s pretty bad.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah. And you know what, they don’t give ice zombies dental normally—
SEAN (AS STAR)
I’m just ushering you through, here we go, ha ha, right into the big chamber, and I’ll just close this door behind you. Good luck at your first meeting!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Bye!
The huge door slams.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, you can’t win ’em all.

SEA:
We open outside the temple Idris and a book is laying half open on the grounds. No one is in sight as a sound builds in the air and the wind halts and the trees stop rustling as time pauses for a millisecond, and there’s a popping sound and Darcy appears a little singed at the edges but overall in good health standing on top of the book.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh…
(huffing)
Lazbo, Lazbo!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
What? Darcy? I’ll be right there! I’m fighting off some flying alligators!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Ahhhhh! Get back, get back! You heard me! No, get off the flowers! Oh god… no… stay away! Oh, oh, oh! Oh Darcy, Darcy, run! Run, run! Alligators… flying!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ahhhh! What is going on?!
MIKE (AS A FLYING ALLIGATOR)
We are here to collect you to be part of an experiment.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Who are you?!
MIKE (AS A FLYING ALLIGATOR)
(weirdly small voice)
I am Steve.
MIKE (AS ANOTHER FLYING ALLIGATOR)
And I am Bob. We are the flying alligators.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are you talking about?!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(out of breath)
I don’t know… they’re flying alligators. Oh god, I’m just gonna stand behind you if that’s okay, Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Lazbo, do you know these flying alligators?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Well yes, that one’s Steve and I believe that one’s Bob.
MIKE (AS BOB THE FLYING ALLIGATOR)
No, no, no. I’m Bob. He’s Steve.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Sorry. Yeah, no, that one is Bob.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did you know them before? Today?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No. They just showed up in the garden. They were trying to find you.
MIKE (AS STEVE THE FLYING ALLIGATOR)
Yeah, we’re here to collect someone for a scientific experiment. Uh, we’re looking for a… uh… oh… what was the name again? Oh, yeah. It’s Darvon. We’re looking for a Darvon?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, that’s not me.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
Oh, no?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
Hah. Well, we are so embarrassed. Um, here… well, here… here’s a couple of gold pieces for the garden. Ummm.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
You’re welcome. Uh, okay, well, we’ll just head out and uh… have any of you heard of a Darvon?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, sorry.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
No?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
Well, maybe we’re on the wrong continuum… again. That happens from time to time.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yeah, no big deal.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But wait, wait.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
If you fly?
MIKE (AS STEVE)
Um-hm.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Do you sometimes take passengers to go long distances?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Darcy, what are you saying?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I don’t know. Couldn’t they help us get to where I need to go, which is back to Celene’s castle?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, right, right, the castle.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
Wait, wait, did you say Celene?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, the Goddess of the Moon.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
Okay, we’re out. Umm…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why?!
MIKE (AS BOB)
We’re not messing with Celene; she’s the Goddess of the Moon. She’s powerful.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Weelllll… she’s not that powerful is she?
MIKE (AS BOB)
She turned us into flying alligators so I’d say yeah, she’s pretty damn powerful!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You make a good point.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
That’s a good point.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That is a good point.
MIKE (AS BOB)
Uh huh. Uh huh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, would you know of a way… uh… people wanting to pay homage… uh… like us… would you know of a way we could get to her special ice castle?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
C‑carrying our weapons.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, no… what he means to say… not our weapons… our sacraments! That’s what he meant to say.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, I thought you said for me to go get my weapons.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh yeah… well, no… the sacraments.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
Those look like weapons to us.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, there’s… they’re holy.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
They’re holey?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
They’re holy… relics.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
They look pretty full to me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
They’re holy relics that we are bringing to Celene.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I don’t get it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s OK.
MIKE (AS STEVE)
Because if they were holey, they would have holes in them.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MIKE (AS BOB)
Right. It’s… it’s… it’s a double meaning on the word holy. Holy can also mean of religious or spiritual importance.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Your voice has changed.
MIKE (AS BOB)
That’s because I’m Bob and he’s…
(cracking up)
Steve, I think it was. Look, anyway, we gotta go… we gotta go! Just find us…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
OK. Would you like a sandwich for the road?
MIKE (AS BOB)
Yeah, of course, we want a sandwich for the road.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Here you go. I’ll put it on the ground.
MIKE (AS BOB)
(viciously devours sandwich)
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Holy shoite. Second?
MIKE (AS BOB)
Nice mustard. Okay, but what you want to do is find some fairies to help you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes. Well, that makes sense.
MIKE (AS BOB)
That’s the answer.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
OK.
MIKE (AS BOB)
That’s a much better offer. Okay. We’ll see you guys later. Bye!

We cut to late at night. There’s a campfire going. We are a few miles from the tree. And Darcy is sitting staring into the fire somewhat forlornly as Lazbo finishes setting the packs all together and setting out the bedrolls.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(deep sigh)
So Lazbo…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yes, yes, I’ll be right there.

Yeah, no… we basically get them from Mother Speckly.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(disappointed)
Ohhhhh.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
She gives them and tells us to… she opens the portals for us.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Right. Okay.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Sorry. Umm…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I just don’t think we’re gonna be able to walk back to the castle. That’s not a great idea.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, I know. I know. I just don’t know what else to do. I did give you the good bedroll though.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s very kind of you Lazbo. Thank you.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
You’re welcome.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, I am pretty tired.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yeah, it’s been a long day for you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And for you, really.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yeah, those flying alligators.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uggh. Yeah, that was very odd.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I wish there was more I could do. Umm… yeah. I’ll stay up on the first watch if you want to get some rest.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’d be great. You don’t happen to know of any fae stones around here, do you?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yuh. Yeah, there’s a fae stone.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You do know where a fae stone is?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yeah, there’s a fae stone.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I think we need to get to the fae stone.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I thought we were going to the castle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I don’t think we can get to the castle without a fae stone.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, so we should go to the fae stone?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think we should go to the fae stone.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Right now?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I think we should because frankly, the prophet could be in big trouble right now at this very moment.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
But then I have to put the bedrolls back.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I’ll help you.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay. Okay. Alright. I just made this for you. I was sorta hoping…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, we could still eat the marshmallows.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’ll eat the marshmallows.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
OK, we’ll eat the marshmallows and then we’ll put the bedrolls away.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And then we’ll put the bedrolls away and then we’ll walk to the fae stone.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Right. It’s only about three weeks walking.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Well, we better get started then.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay, after the marshmallows!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
After the marshmallows.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay.
SEA:
Darcy and Lazbo are walking along a trail in a new direction. And it’s hot. The sun is beating down. It feels like they have been walking for many days. Because they have… when they come across an unexpected person at the side of the road ahead.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(tired)
Are there anymore marshmallows?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(weakly)
No, we ate all the marshmallows Lazbo; there’s only a little bit of water left.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Well you should drink it. I don’t need water as much.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Really? Are you sure? Your skin’s turning a bit purply.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yeah, I’m just saying that. You should drink it though.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no here we’ll… we’ll share it. Let’s… wait… who’s… who’s that up ahead?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
(shouting in questionable Austrian accent)
Yeah, hello! Hello?!!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Hello!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I am in need of assistance!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, we can’t really assist much; we barely have anything to offer.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You do not have anything?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Um, I have some mustard.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
MAHHHH… mustard. I will enjoy the mustard. I have not eaten in several days.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, if you have some mustard, Lazbo, to spare… I guess.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay, do you want Sparkly, Striped or just plain mustard?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Sparkly and stri… youuu must be some sort of wizard! Sparkly and striped mustard?! I just know regular yellow mustard.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Well, I wouldn’t say I’m a wizard but I am working on it, you know.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You’re working to become a wizard?! You are the most impressive people I have ever met! I am merely a humble portal salesman.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I‑I’m sorry. What did you say?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Thank you ‘cos I have been really working on myself and improving.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
That’s quite impressive.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Thank you, thank you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, that’s, that’s… Lazbo… that’s good.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I have other kinds of mustard I can make too if you’re interested.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Did you learn this from a spell book of some sort?
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
No, it’s from Eggerton; he’s just a little Fae and he teaches us how to make mustard.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So, um, we actually have a fair bit of mustard in our pack and we…
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Oh, very good. You can spare some.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We’d be willing to trade it actually for say… a portal?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Ohhhh, now you’re just making fun of me like all the others.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I keep telling people… I know portal technology and they say, “You’re crazy!” And then they start throwing things. I’ve been ejected from the last seventeen villages.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, we… we don’t think you’re crazy. We-we’d like to hear more about these portals.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Look at me! I’m wearing gloves for shoes! I have seen better days.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But you could be in a lot of mustard…
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Ohhhh… mustard.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…if you show us your portal technology.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Alright. So, what happens is… I have these sticks…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh-huh.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
They’re twined together in a big circle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Umm-hmm.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
And you lean it against something and you could just run… you just run through the circle and then you wind up whereever you think.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ummm… has…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
It sounds amazing. It sounds like what we’ve been looking for.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, has it ever actually… worked?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Seventeen different villages chased me out! I have many holes in my back from spears and sharp objects.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Could you perhaps give us a demonstration?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Yah… it’s very simple. Sooo… it’s very delicate… don’t touch it!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Sorry.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Sorry.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Alright, so you just lean it here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um-hm.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You need to keep the big circular thing in the middle open…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um-hm.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
…for entry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um-hm.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
And then… alright, I’m backing up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Um-hm.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
And now, I’m just going to run at it as hard and as fast as I can.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I’m feeling very nervous.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
One!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
And two!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yah.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
And three. PORTAAAAL!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Wait… Darcy, where did he go?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think he’s just on the other side of it.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Yeah, look, I am somewhere else now! I am on the other side.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh. I thought for a minute he actually did it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s ‘cos he ran ’round the tree.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Oh, I see.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I wanted to be on this side of the tree. That’s what I was thinking! And now I’m here!
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
I want to do it next. Can I do it next?
OK… you do it now!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Lazbo though…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Yah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Think of the tree… think of Temple Idris when you run.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Alright.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Okay. Now, you are very big. So you’re gonna want to try to get as small as possible so you can fit in between these dimensions.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
Like this?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Yeah, that’s good. I‑I’ve only built the one. I gonna need to build bigger ones for people of your size. Alright. So you…
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
So I just think of the tree?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You just think…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Think of the tree.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
And then you run.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
The circle. The circle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
SEAN (AS LAZBO)
(muttering under his breath)
I miss the circle so much.
(out loud)
Okay, one, two, three. CIRCLLLE!
He vanishes with a pop.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Yah, it’s pretty good.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So where… where is he?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I‑I don’t know the location you were talking about.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, Lazbo? Wait a minute, this… this couldn’t have actually worked.
MARIS:
And I run around the tree. I run a few metres in each direction.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
La-Lazbo. Lazbo?
(in disbelief)
I‑I think your portal worked.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
JA! I make portals!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, let me see. What have you made this out of?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
It’s just sticks.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, but I’ve never seen sticks like these!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Ah, it’s sticks from a special tree.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s not any tree I’ve ever known.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
No, it’s just… probably just the one.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wow, I‑I-I think I need this portal. Well, wait, I don’t even need this portal. I just need to run through this portal. This is incredible.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Ohhhhh! Wait a second. So, now you know that my portal works?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
And you’re just offering mustard?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, no.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I am wearing gloves as shoes. You have to give something else now. Mustard was for your friend. Friend is gone. So now you have to give something else for portal running.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, the problem is that Lazbo had all the mustard.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Ohhhh! Well, youuuuu do not have a portal now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Good day to you madam.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, wait! I‑I have other things to offer you! Umm… wait.
MARIS:
And I scrabble around in my pack.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Ooooohhh… look.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
What… what do you have?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What about this shiny…
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Show me what you have!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What about this shiny apple?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Ohhhhh, it’s like food.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s like food, but it’s not food.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Oh no! I want food!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh… really?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Look at me! I’m starving to death!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, wait! Why can’t you just use your own portal to run to a market square where you can get as much food as you want? You must come from a village that you know of where there’s people selling their…
She starts laughing off Carter’s agog reaction. The whole table joins in.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You must!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
(weeping)
Seventeen different villages! I’ve been horribly beaten by so many unbelievers and now you just told me I should just use… get out of my way woman! I’m going to go portal myself into the finest buffet restaurant!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, go!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Okay, buffet restaurant, buffet restaurant, buffet restaurant. Run!
He vanishes too.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s incredible. I cannot believe our luck. Alright, Celene… here I come!
MARIS:
And I grab the book close and I clutch my satchel and I run at the portal thinking of Celene’s Ice Palace and the clearing outside of it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
AAAAHHHHHH!
Pop.
EGGERTON AND PER:
SEA:
We see Eggerton standing, his hands outstretched as a matrix of light and streams of energy branch off in every direction. Silhouettes of fae stones across universes lighting up as he shifts his attention, an insane maze and network of connections. But he has no idea which one is the right one.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Eeeny, Meeny, Miny, Show, catch a goddess by the toe. If she hollers let her go because you’re probably causing discomfort and that’s not very friendly. Eeeny meeny miny… that’s the one. I can tell because it looks exactly like all the others.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, it’s you.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
You again.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Pffft. You’re not even a real Fae.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I’m a Fae. You’re not a Fae.
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, I said you’re not a real Fae. Of course you’re a Fae… you’re just not a real Fae.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
What’s the difference between a Fae and a real Fae?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Well, I could go where I need to go.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I can go there too.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Fine.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Alright.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Alright, I’ll just go now.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, see you later.
SEAN (AS PERI)
You know where you’re going right?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yup, totally… don’t need any assistance or guidance from unusual people who happen to show up in my path.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay. I’ll go tell Celene you’re lost.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, but if you were gonna go to Celene, which… which fae stone would you take?
SEAN (AS PERI)
HA HA HA HA! I told you.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, why don’t you just go? I’ll sit here and look the other way.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. I’m not gonna watch which fae stone you go to.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Right. Well, well… I’m gonna go a different way.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. I trust you. I don’t think you’re trying to manipulate me.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, yeah, I’m gonna go to the wrong fae stone.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t believe in reverse psychology.
SEAN (AS PERI)
I believe in reverse reverse psychology. I’m gonna go to the right fae stone.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, I’m gonna go to the double dutch disco fae stone.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, well, I’m gonna go there first.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
You know what? I don’t know why we’re so acrimonious all the time.
SEAN (AS PERI)
No reason! I‑I don’t find you attractive at all.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you know… I think that you’re pretty neat. And I think that we should probably go and have tea sometime.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Really?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah! Why not? At the very least we can be friends. And if there’s something else, there’s something else.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, maybe sometime… maybe sometime. But I’m gonna go to the wrong place now.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, you go to the wrong place. And I won’t follow you there.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(giggles)
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
And then later we won’t meet up for tea.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Right.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay, you won’t follow me.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m not gonna follow you.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, you go.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay, I’m gonna go. You watching?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, just don’t leave that trail of sparkles behind you.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay. But you’re watching?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Paying attention?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Here I go!
She blinks out.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Heh, heh.
He blinks out too.
THE CAVER:
SEA:
Blat and his two security personnel step into a massive ice cave. The walls gleam and reflect with facets as if there are a hundred of them entering when it’s really just the three. In the centre of this magnificent cave is a very large blue diamond that is the size of a house and it gleams with a strange light. And in the far, far recess, barely lit by this blue light, is a throne and on that throne sits a figure with their head on their hand. Waiting.
MIKE (AS GOH)
And then he flipped the table on me… can you believe it?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
No… I think… I think you flipped the table on me actually.
MIKE (AS GOH)
No, no, no… this was the last time. You were… you were havin’ a mood and you were flippin’ tables.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah, I may have. But you know, I think as co-stewards…
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
We should like… maybe just you know… focus right now.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Focus. Alright, alright. So…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
We gotta figure out if this is the real Celene or the fake Celene.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, yeah and what’s… what’s the test again new friend?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in gruff voice)
The only thing you need to worry about is whether this Celene can be killed.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Right.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Right.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
‘cos if she can be killed… not a goddess… fake Celene.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Alright let’s do it. Let’s… let’s…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
No wait… uh…
MIKE (AS GOH)
What?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Now if… just… just a crazy thought but if she is the real goddess she’ll just, like, smoke us instantly.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But, would she?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Uh, that’s a good point.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You work for her.
MIKE (AS GOH)
She’d probably wanna toy with us a bit first.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh yeah, she likes to toy with her prey actually.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
I’ve seen that.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, yeah.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
That’s a good… that’s a good point.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, so if she kills us right away it’s not Celene.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Right and we should’ve killed her.
MIKE (AS GOH)
And if we kill her it’s not Celene.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
But if we can’t kill her and she doesn’t kill us right away…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
But kills us slowly.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Slowly. Yeah. Slowly with a lot of terror.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
A lot of terror involved.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Then that’s really Celene.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Alright.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
In which case we should present our demands for the union.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Well, not until we kill the fake Celene ‘cos that’s the leverage we need.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Right.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Right. So what we need to do is try and kill this person.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
And if they die, then we were right. If they kill us…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
I’m getting confused.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, okay. Here’s what we’re going to do. Give me my sword.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay. With a… with a scabbard or without?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Uh… no… we left the scabbards behind remember?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah. Okay, so I’m gonna take… take my sword. I’m gonna go stab ‘er.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Um… if… you know she’s unhappy about that…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Then maybe… umm… it’s not really…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
I’m just getting a really bad feeling about this stabbing actually.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, it’s fine, it’s fine. Okay, okay… here we go… here we go. Okay, I’m gonna walk up to her.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Well, it’s gonna take you a while but alright, we’ll watch you go.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Alright, I’ll do a light jog.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay.
MIKE (AS GOH)
I’ve been doing cardio on my off days.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Alright.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, ready?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
(sets off jogging)
Huff, huff, huff, huff.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
You think this is gonna work?
SEA:
(to Mike)
No, keep… it’s a long way… keep going.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh… huff, huff, huff, huff
(constant panting underneath following conversation)
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
So, um… Blat… Blatamixil? Um… you sure about this?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I am absolutely sure that this is going to keep us… out of immediate danger.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay. Oh, he’s about a quarter of the way there.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay… just breathe… it’s okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So, uh… do you guys have any other coworkers around who might wanna help us with this little experiment?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Uh, well… Star but Star didn’t want…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Star didn’t want to, no.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Whoops! Crack in the ice but it’s fine.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was just expecting more people to be around. You know it’s a big castle.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
It is. Well we’re just first shift so there would be a second shift coming on soon.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, well when would that happen?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Well, I don’t know when they show up. Um…
MIKE (AS GOH)
(calling back)
Hey, did I leave my puffer with you?!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah… no I have it here!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, okay… I should come back and get that.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah, yeah… I know… I got it right here!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, I’ll be right there.
(more panting)
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay. Sorry… you were saying?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh, I was just wondering when the second shift…‘cos you seem to know that there’s a second shift.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah, yeah.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So when does the first shift end?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
It hasn’t ever ended. But they’re supposed to.
MIKE (AS GOH)
(gasping)
Okay, okay… I just need my puffer.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh, yeah… sorry. Here.
MIKE (AS GOH)
(takes puff of inhaler)
Okay.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
You want me to hold that?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Just one more.
(inhales)
Okay, yeah here you go. Thanks, thanks.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah, I’ll hold it for you.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, okay. Now I’m going. I’m going back.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
‘cos you always lose it.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, I’m always losing it. Okay, okay, I’m back.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
You made it to the diamond. Keep going.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Rothkar! What are you doing?! I brought your lunch for you and you weren’t there.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Um, hi… hi Gromexil. Uh…
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
You don’t call me Gromexil in front of guests. You call me Mummy…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yes Mummy.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Or Mumsy…
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yes Mumsy.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Or Moo-Moo-Moo.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Moo-Moo-Moo. Yes… I don’t like saying that in front of…
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Now why is Goh running so hard…
MIKE (AS GOH)
Ooops… there’s some crap here.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
…with his asthma? Goh! Goh! It’s lunchtime!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Mumsy. No, I‑I gotta go stab this… this fake Celene first.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Goh, come here! Stabbing later… lunch now!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh… okay… I’ll be right there.
(more panting)
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Sorry Mumsy… oh Mumsy… this is our new friend… um… uh Blathoximil.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
What do you mean… friend?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh he’s… he’s helping us start a union.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I told you… no unions!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
I know Mums… I know… I just…
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
No unions. They get us in trouble!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yes Mumsy.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
You eat your lunch, you do your work and we go and we eat our stew at night.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yes Mumsy.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Hi Mummy.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Oh Goh, how are you feeling? You look terrible.
MIKE (AS GOH)
(gasping throughout)
Well, I ran most of the way there and then I remembered my puffer and I gave it to him because I always lose it so I ran back and I used my puffer and then I started to run back to stab and then you came with lunch.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Why are you running?!
MIKE (AS GOH)
Because it’s far and it’s… it’s bad. We just gotta get there.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Shhh. No, no don’t… no don’t…
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, oh. I’m not supposed to tell her about the stabbing?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
(whispering)
No.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
(under his breath)
Or the union.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Who are you two stabbing now?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Uh, oh… we’re just stabbing each other.
Rothkar and Goh laugh nervously.
MIKE (AS GOH)
See? See? I’ll stab him.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh, ow… ow… now I stab you back.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Okay, okay, yeah. I know. You do that yesterday too. That’s okay. Now, who’s this one… the red one with the horns?
MIKE (AS GOH)
He’s our new friend.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I… there are not supposed to be any friends here.
MIKE (AS GOH)
This is Mo.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
(whispering)
Shhh… no… no union.
MIKE (AS GOH)
No union?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
No.
MIKE (AS GOH)
But we’re starting a union.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
(sighs)
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
No unions! Now, what did Star say about this? Star should not have let you through the doorway.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Star was very friendly and thought it was a great idea.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Star is never very friendly.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Well, that’s why it was so great.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Ohhhhhh… you two are up to something. You! You! Red One. What are you doing with my boys?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, madam… I have it on good authority that the employer of your boys might actually be an evil clone.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
You mean the Holy Goddess?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah, yeah. Yeah… see? That’s what we’re doing mum… we’re gonna prove that she’s a clone or not a clone and then… yeah… that’s what we’re…
MIKE (AS GOH)
Because see… if… if we kill her then she was fake. And then Celene’s gonna reward us.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
There’s no clone.
MIKE (AS GOH)
What… what are you talking about?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Well, how do you know?
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I know because 20 villagers were sacrificed this morning by Celene herself. That’s no clone… that’s Celene!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Or is that a clone just trying to fit in?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, that’s… that’s… that’s some solid logic right there.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Aaaaahhhhhh. Hmmmmmm.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
The only way we can tell if she’s a clone is if we kill her.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
No, that sounds stupid. But she could always be a clone.
MIKE (AS GOH)
But if we try and kill her and she doesn’t die, then she’s real and we verified it.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Hmmmmmm.
MIKE (AS GOH)
That’s the scientific process is to… to form a hypothesis.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Oh, I know I should’ve never sent you boys to that three day school.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
I know.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
You mix me up and I don’t always understand what you’re saying.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oxford comma, exactly.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Ohhhh Goh, none of that now.
MIKE (AS GOH)
(dejected)
Ohhh.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
No more of that. Here. Eat your sandwiches.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh okay.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Thanks Mum.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
…while I think about this a minute.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh… horseradish. My favourite.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Why do you, horn person… why do you want to start a union with my sons? You don’t work here.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But Madam, I think you’ll find that most places are happier once they unionise. Increased wages, dental.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
The benefits mom. Benefits.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Dental.
MIKE (AS GOH)
But this would fix my cracked molar. See I showed you the cracked molar and it was hurting.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, if you wouldn’t keep biting your brother.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, but he pushed me.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
The fang coming out. Mom… on your face.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Yeah, I don’t like the fang.
MIKE (AS GOH)
We could make sure that you stick with only five boils instead of six.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Really?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I don’t know. Everyone else who comes and talks of unioning… they get killed.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Well, yeah… I know.
MIKE (AS GOH)
But that’s why we need the leverage of stabbing the fake Celene.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Yeah, Celene’ll be happy.
MIKE (AS GOH)
To show real Celene.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
We kill the fake Celene and she’ll be…
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
But what if there is no fake Celene?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Then Celene will see our initiative…
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Ohhhhhh.
MIKE (AS GOH)
In trying to protect her realm.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Oh, and you move up in world?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
And I don’t just have to live in the cave.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Exactly.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
And we could take Star’s place.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
We could take two caves.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh yeah!
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
We could… we could take three caves.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Ohhhhhh.
MIKE (AS GOH)
We could get more magazines.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I do want my boys to have career fluidity, you know, to move up in the world.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
And as someone who lives with them, you would also get the health benefits.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Ohhhhhhhh.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, there you go. Okay, what do you say Mumsy? Should I go? Should I go? Should I go test this?
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I am nervous for you. You get hurt so much with the flipping of the tables all the time.
MIKE (AS GOH)
I don’t flip the tables.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
You always flip the tables.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
You both flip the tables.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Well, sometimes you know, that’s just… you have to express yourself.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I don’t think you should go with your asthma.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, okay. Why don’t you go and I’ll stay here?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, here’s the sword.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Here you go. It’s the ice sword. No scabbard.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Okay, I’ll be right back guys.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Do I have my puffer first?
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
Oh yeah… here.
(starts panting which continues over following conversation)
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, thanks… I’ll keep that in my pocket.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now, Madam, how long has it been since you’ve been in the workforce?
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Oh, I‑I never worked. My-my man worked but I always sit at home with boys, make stew.
MIKE (AS GOH)
But it choice of Mumsy. Mumsy capable of working.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Oh yes! I love it. I love it.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, she choose.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh absolutely. Absolutely.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
(from afar)
I’m halfway there guys!
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Okay, good boy, good boy! He didn’t have his sandwich before he start running.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh. And he forgot his puffer.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Oh… well, he doesn’t need it as much as you.
MIKE (AS GOH)
True.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
This might actually be a golden opportunity for you to work with your boys on this endeavour. How are you with a sword?
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I’m pretty good.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, Mumsy’s being bashful. She taught us everything we know about swords.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Well, I prefer battleaxe.
MIKE (AS GOH)
True, true. She likes the double sided.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Yeah.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Because that way when you pull it out of one person you chopped you can immediately put it into someone else to chop.
SEAN (AS ROTHKAR)
(in the distance)
Hah! Take that fake Celene! AAAAGHHHHHHHHHHH!
MIKE (AS GOH)
I didn’t quite hear what he was saying. I should go check it out.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
What? No, I don’t know. That sounded bad.
MIKE (AS GOH)
No, I think he was, like, celebrating. That was a battle cry.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Really?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Yeah, that was a battle cry.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I can never tell. They all sound the same.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay. I’ll go check it out.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
“Oh, I’m dying. Oh, I’m winning!” I don’t know the difference.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, I know. It’s… we try. We try. But okay, I’ve got… maybe if someone paid for the fourth day of school. But anyway, I’ll go and I’ll check it out and I’ll report back soon. Okay?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Alright.
MIKE (AS GOH)
You two… you two keep company and you… be nice to Mumsy.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
MIKE (AS GOH)
I’ve got my eye on you. Okay, here I go.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Okay Goh.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait Mumsy before I go can you hold my puffer? I don’t want to lose it.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Okay, I will.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Alright here we go. Okay.
(starts panting which continues under following conversation)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So I don’t know if there were any battleaxes around… is there an extra sword?
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
No, mine’s back in my cave.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I see.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I had it bronzed.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh very good.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Yes. Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
That must look very nice.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
It’s very nice. It hangs over the fire pit.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ahhh. Very good, very good.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Ahhhh. Oh Mumsy. How are your boys doing?
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I don’t know. Goh is going to check on Rothkar now.
SEAN (AS STAR)
They’re still alive. That’s better than I expected. Oh hello… what’s your name?
MIKE (AS GOH)
Okay, okay Celene, I’m gonna get you now. And I’m just gonna… OH GOD… WHY… IT BURNS… AAAGHHHHHH!
SEAN (AS STAR)
Ah, there we go… that’s what I was expecting.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Why you… you have smiley face that I don’t like. Why you smile like that?
SEAN (AS STAR)
Oh, your boys had this great plan Mumsy. They were gonna go and kill Celene so I let them in.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
No, fake Celene they were going to kill!
SEAN (AS STAR)
Oh right, yes, oh yeah. No right, fake Celene.
(giggles)
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
I don’t know why this one smiles like that all the time. It’s like she says one thing but she means another. I don’t understand it.
SEAN (AS STAR)
(sarcastically)
Oh, it’s so confusing.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Yes, it is.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I think Star is against the idea of you reentering the workforce.
SEAN (AS STAR)
(sarcastically)
Oh, yes. I so am.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Well, that does not sound very progressive. My boys tell me that someone like me could get back into the workforce regardless of my age.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Oh, yes. No, you should unionise. You should speak to Celene about that right away.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
No, I don’t like that. But you… horn boy. I see you have wing things. Why don’t you fly over there? That seems to make more sense.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Oh, yes, yes.
(clapping hands)
That sounds like a lovely idea.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Go see what my boys are doing and take them their sandwiches.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Sure, just hand over the sandwiches. It was worth a shot.
CARTE:
And Blat flies off towards Celene’s throne.
MIDROL:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey, everyone, Sean here and I just want to say wow, thank you for everyone that’s listening. We saw a big jump in numbers after coming back from our break and that was so awesome. And we’re super excited to have Eggerton back with us.
Before we go on, I want to give a shout out to some old timers that have been with us for forever. And that means so much to us. So first off to Joshua Goldsmith… thank you. Stephen Smith, you live with us. Super awesome you’re supporting us. You’re our roommate. David Rheinstrom: unbelievable to have you here with us, thank you. Marion—Momo, who’s done so many of the awesome illustrations of our End of Time crew. Can’t imagine being here without you. And Evil Kitten Productions, the creators of Jack Tracer and one of my favourite shows, Project Nova. Love everything they do and thank you so much for being with us.
And it’s also time to give some shout outs to some new subscribers, some new patrons, some new supporters. Some new super awesome people. My apologies if I get any of these names wrong. Lucas Oster. Thank you. Phoebe Cara Dory. Amazing. Thank you. October Isle. Super awesome to have you here with us. Stephanie Cheshire, thank you. Magdalena Pluinska? I hope I said that right. Crafty Druid and Chris Bauer, thank you so much for coming on and becoming a patron; it means that we can continue to create more of this content.
And speaking of more content, End of Time is continuing on, we’re gonna get you right back to the show. But we’re also about to launch a new podcast. So just gonna tease you here. Civilised is an entirely improvised dark comedy sci-fi. That launches… well, basically, by the time you listen to this, I think it’ll have launched or shortly thereafter… shortly coming up. It’s coming soon, sometime. Eli is not looking at me. So I have no idea when. Anyway, so let’s get you back to the show. Thank you all so much. And here we go.
MIDROLL: CHARACTER SHEE:
SEA:
Okay, everyone. Welcome. Thank you for coming to the table today. As we all know, fans have been a little upset that Michael has never looked at nor read his character sheet.
CARTE:
It’s not fair.
SEA:
So today, Michael, we’re here to help you. Now you set a goal… I don’t think it was fair… of 500 signatures.
MICHAE:
500.
SEA:
Right. So I think we’re at what percentage Carter?
CARTE:
6?
SEA:
Right. So what I thought, is to show the table your commitment Michael.
MICHAE:
My commitment.
SEA:
You would read 6% of your character sheet today. And if people want to go to patreon.com/albasalix and donate or leave us a comment showing their support we’ll make sure the link… go to otherbothers.com… we’ll put the link there too so people can sign this and maybe we can get to a little further. Does that sound good for everyone?
CARTE:
Okay, 6% of it.
SEA:
6%.
MICHAE:
Alright, is everybody ready?
SEA:
Yeah.
MICHAE:
Alright. Flightless Fairy Druid. Level Three. XP. Name: Eggerton.
SEA:
Wait, you didn’t tell us how much XP.
MICHAE:
Oh, uh… three checkboxes.
SEA:
Thank you.
MICHAE:
Appearance. That’s roughly 6%.
SEA:
(laughs)
I feel like this midroll is falling apart from underneath us.
MARIS:
No, it’s better than the last one.
(raucous laughter)
SEA:
Ha ha! Scene!
CELENE’S CASTL:
SCEN:
We cut to a small shack outside. It is snowing. And a blizzard is forming and the wind is roaring and whistling through the trees and gaps. And Darcy appears stepping out of a shimmering circular portal with a somewhat surprised look on her face. The ice castle is off in the distance gleaming in the setting sunlight.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I can’t believe it. It worked. I’m here! I’m exactly where I need to be. But it’s taken so long, Eggerton and Blat could be… who knows where… they could already be dead. I have to get to that spot that we were at or I have to get to the castle. I better just start towards the castle.
MARIS:
And I start running in the direction of the castle.
SEA:
Okay. So as you are approaching the castle you see a drawbridge and you see two Fae standing at the drawbridge, each with a large pike weapon with a gleaming silver tip.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh… halt there!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… hello. I am here as a supplicant to the Grand Celene… goddess of all things bright and shiny.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Not a fae.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Yeah… not a fae.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well no, I didn’t say I was a fae. I’m a supplicant; it’s more important that I’m not a fae because this means I’m someone new coming to your fold.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Suspicious! Lot taller than us. Don’t like it.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Nope. Yup. No you gotta be a fae to get in.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Really? You don’t let anyone else in ever?
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Well, um… Celene’s in there.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Yeah, she’s… oh… the ice monster!
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Oh yeah… the ice monster. That’s true.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I’m kinda like an ice monster.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
You are?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I’m taller than you.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Well, what’s that supposed to mean?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, you just said that you wouldn’t let me in because I was taller than you. But you let the ice monster in.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
(weakly)
The ice monster is taller than us.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
(confused)
Wait… well now… is she an ice monster?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I’d be covered in ice.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh, yeah… no you’re right.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m not a monster. I want to come and show Celene how much I worship her and appreciate her. I’m sure she would want that.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Maybe you could just… leave her a note?
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Or… or… or pray to her!
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Oh, yeah. She likes that!
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, oh… offer her your unborn child.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Oh yeah! Do you have any of those?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I do have unborn children. Absolutely.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Ooohhhh!
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh yeah. She likes that.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Promise her all of them.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh, yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But couldn’t I do that in front of her? Or near her?
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
You want to be near Celene?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, yes, I want to bask in her presence.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
See, this sounds okay. But then you gotta think… why are we here… guarding? Like maybe we’re supposed to keep people from going in?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, you’re supposed to keep people who mean harm to Celene going in… of course!
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh, that makes sense. Yeah, it checks. It checks.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Yeah, that’s solid. That’s true.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I would have guards too. I mean, if I was a goddess, I’d be very afraid of people wanting to take my throne or wanting to take my fairies or wanting to take my gold.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
You want to take the throne?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, but I’d be afraid of that. And so I’d put guards. But if people came who wanted to be nice to me, and tell me how great I was and pray to me… well, I’d want those people to be let through immediately.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
You see, they should have brought this up in training.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Yeah, I’m really not sure what to do here. Normally, it’s just like, “Halt! You don’t come here!” And they run away!
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Yeah, yeah, people usually ran away pretty good.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Well, if you were in charge, and you put two really good guards out on your, you know, drawbridge…
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Really good!
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh yeah.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Very good.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Like the best guards you could find. Um, and you train them really good… what would you tell them to do in this situation?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I would say… in this situation… you should let this new supplicant through. Because obviously, I’m no threat to anyone. Look at me! I’m scrawny. I have a bag. I have no weapons on me. I even have this book that Celene would love to have. It’s an ancient book she doesn’t have in her collection, I bet.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Oooh, free book!
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh, yeah. What’s the title?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The title is…“Oh, to the moon and back”.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh, that sounds lovely!
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
It’s relevant.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Yes! I think Celene would like that book.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sure she would. I would let me through. But let me tell you, if anyone who was mean to you, or had big weapons or something came to this drawbridge, don’t let them through. You should be looking out for them. In fact, you wanna look out right now, you wanna keep an eye out just in case.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Are they coming?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, they might be… but I think you better focus on that.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Yeah. Okay, quick, get out of our way… we can’t see!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Absolutely.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Get inside.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You guys are doing a great job. Thank you!
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
I’m gonna look towards the left, you look towards the right.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Wait, our right or the right of the approacher?
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
No, our right, looking at a potential approacher.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Okay, but if I’m on the right, and you’re on the left, who’s looking straight ahead?
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Oh my Lord! Okay, so, okay, you go in, find a third guard…
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh, good point!
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
…put them out here and then we’ll each man three stations.
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Okay, and you can separate yourself into three in the meantime!
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
What?!
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh, you can’t do that?
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
What? You can do that?
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
No, I just thought you could do that.
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
Well, how can I do that?!
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
I don’t know. You’re a fae!
CARTER (AS FAE 2)
You’re not a fae?
SEAN (AS FAE 1)
Oh s——.
EGGERTON AND PER:
SEA:
Okay, Eggerton?
MICHAE:
Hello?
SEA:
Where do we find Eggerton and Peri?
MICHAE:
Ummm… talking over chai lattes.
SEAN (AS PERI)
I really… I really must say I like this cafe. Ha ha!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Isn’t it nice? I mean, they talk a lot about deer for some reason but they’ve got star right in the name. So I thought it would be a nice place for us to go hang out.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, it’s actually quite nice. I like the scones.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Um-hm, um-hm. As long as they’re not too heated or like overcooked or anything. That would be gross.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah no, it’s quite nice.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Um.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
So, um, tell me about… uhh… do you have any siblings?
SEAN (AS PERI)
(giggles nervously)
Oh what? What’d you say?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Siblings. Do you have like older… older brothers or sisters… younger?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, about 300.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, yeah, so about average size. That’s nice.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, yeah… I’m sort of in the middle-ish.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Uh huh. Uh huh.
SEAN (AS PERI)
What about you?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, well, no, you know, in my time fae are just kind of one at a time now. It’s a little sad, yeah.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, my God. I’m so sorry I made fun of you not flying. I mean…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
It’s OK.
SEAN (AS PERI)
I just hadn’t seen a fae that didn’t fly.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Well, sometimes, you know, when we see something unusual, it’s easier to laugh at it than to try and understand it.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
But you know what, you’ve got very pretty eyes.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
And a handsome smile… and I’m glad we’re doing this.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Me too. Heh, heh.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Um, but, you know, we’ve been here a couple hours, and I should probably go look for my friends.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh right.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I mean, we’ve had a great conversation.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah. Hey, I don’t want to hold you up. I… you know… it’s cool, cool, cool.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Tell you what, I’ll tell you what. No, here. Here’s the… the… the code for my Ice‑T.
SEAN (AS PERI)
What?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
So we’ve got these devices. They’re called Ice-Ts. And you can use them to communicate.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, you’re gonna give me your code?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, I’m gonna give you my code. So then, you know, you can go get an Ice‑T.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Is it really your code?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, of course it is. I wouldn’t do that to you.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, okay.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
So you go get an Ice‑T. Right. You can probably pop up into Paradox.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Here’s… here’s a bit of my hair.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oooo. Thank you.
SEAN (AS PERI)
You can use that to talk with me.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, okay. So…
SEAN (AS PERI)
It’s really my hair too.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Ahh… nice. Umm… so, I need to go and find my friends.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, yeah, so…
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
But I’m gonna give you a call later.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah. Of course you will.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
And we’re gonna do this again!
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah. Okay.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Alright. Maybe we’ll go for a walk too next time.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah. No, sure.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
I heard about… remember that forest where we met?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Why don’t we go for a walk there?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Alright. We’ll get some tea to go, we’ll go for a walk there.
SEAN (AS PERI)
I love that one tree.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Um-hm, um-hm. You keep going around it?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
But you’re never around it.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Isn’t that fun?
SEAN (AS PERI)
It is!
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
OK. OK. OK. But I do need to go help my friends. They’re probably gonna be mad that I’m late.
SEAN (AS PERI)
OK. No, I know you do. No, no, I know. I’ve taken too much of your time.
MIKE (AS GOH)
No, I’m the leader. So they kind of expect me to be there.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, right.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
But okay. Well, it was nice to see you. May I give you a hug?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Or a kiss?
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, okay.
(kisses Peri)
Very nice.
She smothers Eggerton in hugs and kisses.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Mmmph!
SEAN (AS PERI)
(growls)
I’ll talk to you soon, lover boy.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
(recovering breathlessly)
Okay. Oh my. It’s okay. Okay. Whew! Alright. So I can do a fae thing and off I go!
SEA:
You’re still sitting there.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, that didn’t work.
SEA:
Because you’re not at a fae stone.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, right.
SEA:
The fae stone near the cafe was a 10 minute walk.
MICHAEL (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, I’ll go for a walk. It’s nice. It’s nice. I’ll go for a walk. Uh, excuse me. Barista? Can I get this in a to-go cup? No, I don’t need a lid. No, I don’t need a lid. That’s wasteful. I just need the cup. A cup. No, without the sleeve. Just a cup. Okay, you know what, I’m going to come do it myself. It’s okay. It’s okay. No, you sit back down on your break.
(fades out)
INSIDE THE CASTL:
SEA:
Darcy is moving quickly but quietly down a hall. Going deeper into the palace not entirely sure which way she’s headed, or why she’s chosen this path when out in front of her steps a shadowy figure with a long rapier.
CARTER (AS FAE 3)
Sorry, I was told I had to go to the front. They need a third guard. Excuse me, sir. Oh, wait. No, I‑I guess I should question you. Are you here to be nice?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Absolutely.
CARTER (AS FAE 3)
Okey-doke. Well, that checks out. I gotta get out there. They want three guards. Three! We’re gonna protect Celene.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re doing an excellent job.
CARTER (AS FAE 3)
Thank you!
SEA:
And as Darcy goes to start down the corridor again, a voice stops her from behind her this time.
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Yeah, no, I don’t think so. I remember you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry?
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
From the glade. I saw you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Who are you?
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
An old friend of Blat’s.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, if you’re a friend of Blat’s, then you must be a friend of mine.
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Yeah, when I say friend… I mean we have unfinished business. Him and I.
MARIS:
And I turn around to look at who’s behind me.
SEA:
You see a person in a cloak but there’s really no body there, just a pair of eyes staring out at you from the cloak.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re one of those shadow people, aren’t you?
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Yes. The Jolly Jester they call me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So, you met Blat?
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Yes. And I would have killed him if he hadn’t done whatever it is he did.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, what are you doing here?
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Stopping you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What am I doing?!
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Tryna get to Celene.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I am, but that’s only because I want to tell her how much I love her.
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Yeah, right. When I bring her your head.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me?
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
She’s gonna reward me and give me a place on her throne.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So you’re just in it for the power.
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Uh-huh. And you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m just in it for the moon.
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Well, let’s see what happens shall we?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine.
SEA:
And suddenly he’s a blur of motion launching at you, Darcy. What do you do?
MARIS:
I try to dodge.
SEA:
Okay. Roll Defy Danger.
MARIS:
What… do I get a plus?
SEA:
Uh… yeah.
MARIS:
Dex, I guess. Right?
SEA:
Using Dex +1.
MARIS:
That’s a 7.
SEA:
Okay, mixed success. So you just manage to sidestep as you see out from under the cloak a ghost-like rapier appear and slash at you. And it connects with you, causing you to drop the book.
MARIS:
OK.
SEA:
And the book hits the ground and if you could roll damage for me.
MARIS:
And what’s damage?
SEA:
It’s a 1d10.
MARIS:
Oh my gosh. What?! Is that this thing?
SEA:
Yep.
MARIS:
It’s a 6!
SEA:
Do you have any armour?
MARIS:
Not right now!
SEA:
(laughing)
So it connects with you, moving across, but you sidestep what could have been worse and he cackles with glee.
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Heh, heh, heh! This is gonna be easier than I thought.
SEA:
What do you want to do Darcy? He’s slowly circling you tryna get around behind you.
MARIS:
So, I cast Hold Person.
SEA:
‘kay, read me that.
MARIS:
So, Hold Person. Choose a person you can see. Until you cast a spell or leave their presence they cannot act except to speak.
MICHAE:
Can you see a shadow person?
MARIS:
Well, that’s the question but I assume I can.
SEA:
Yeah. Okay… roll it.
MARIS:
(rolling)
Okay, that’s a 7 + 2 is a 9.
SEA:
Okay, what happens on a seven to nine?
MARIS:
Okay, on a seven to nine the spell is cast but choose one: I draw unwelcome attention or put myself on the spot. Uh, my casting distances me from my deity which means take minus one ongoing to cast a spell or after it is cast the spell’s revoked. So I’ll cast it but revoke… have it revoked.
SEA:
Okay. He freezes in the air, unmoving, just vibrating.
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
Unngh! What have you done?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hopefully this’ll hold you for a while.
SEAN (AS THE JOLLY JESTER)
I will find you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, let’s hope not.
MARIS:
And I grab the book, and I just take off as fast as I can down the nearest corridor.
SEA:
‘kay.
THE CAVER:
SEA:
We return to the giant cave beneath the castle. The giant blue diamond is now humming and thrumming to almost like a heartbeat echoing throughout this chamber as Blathoxil, wings spread, arcs forward towards Celene… who has not moved from atop her throne.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I was concerned after those two died… but I’ve got my own idea. This house-sized diamond looks important.
Bazooka.
The bazooka materializes.
SEA:
Okay, are you firing?
CARTE:
Blat fires.
SEA:
Roll Volley. That’s plus Dex.
MARIS:
Nice.
CARTE:
That would be a 10.
SEA:
That is a direct hit. The screen pops up, you centre it, you pull the trigger and, even as you pull the trigger, you sense movement from the throne out of the corner of your eye. And the missile launches, arcs down and connects. Roll your damage.
CARTE:
7.
SEA:
And the shell explodes on impact sending some shards flying and you notice the light shifting and the humming becoming a little more erratic but the crystal appears to still be whole.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, that’s a shame. Maybe just one more time.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I don’t think so Blat. Good to see you again.
SEA:
A figure is striding forward across the ground right next to the crystal.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
It’s been how long, my Blathoxil?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Long enough for me to have this voice.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Hmm. You’ve done well Blathoxil.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I would disagree.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh no. You’ve brought me…
(menacingly)
Exactly what I wanted. And now I will take the goddess inside of you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Morragu?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Yes.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You can have her.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Perfect.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
But, before that happens, let’s break a shiny thing.
CARTE:
And Blat fires again at the giant diamond.
SEA:
Okay, roll to hit.
MARIS:
Nice.
CARTE:
That would be, plus my Dexterity, a 12.
MICHAE:
Ho, ho, ho. That’s a game changer.
MARIS:
(laughs)
SEA:
She goes to lift her hand and you see her eyes grow a little wide as the projectile streams right past her and impacts with the crystal and, as it hits, she screams in rage. Roll your damage. It’s a d8.
CARTE:
Merely a 4.
SEA:
Explosion impacts. She doesn’t move. Like the fireball spreads out around her and then dissipates and she’s still standing there but the crystal is starting to crack and it’s starting to beat in a very erratic fashion. And she… does not look happy.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh Blat, I was going to leave you and your husk alone. But not any longer!
SEA:
Blat, I need you to make a Defy Danger constitution roll as her eyes change colour and actually light stabs out from them up towards you in the air.
CARTE:
12.
MARIS:
(laughing)
A natural 12.
MICHAE:
(laughing)
So, technically a 13.
MARIS:
Yup.
SEA:
So Blat somehow goes into a dive spiral and avoids looking at her in the eyes as he does so. And she looks a little stunned. And then she raises her other hand and a wall of flame comes filling the whole air up towards you, like a wall of flame is now moving at high speed towards you in your dive.
CARTE:
Blat keeps fluttering in the same spot. It’s fire.
SEA:
Would you like to read me that ability that I forgot about?
(laughter from the table)
CARTE:
Well, there’s no real ability to talk about.
MARIS:
Yeah, he’s just not affected by it.
CARTE:
It’s just Blat has never really had a problem with fire.
SEA:
Right. Okay, and so the wave of fire passes over you and you’re feeling a little smug. And when you look up you realise Celene is three inches in front of you. And she kisses you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Clever girl.
SEA:
Roll 4d6 for me. Well, first of all, you get a chance. Well, you get a chance, I guess, if you want to… let’s roll Defy Danger. To try and avoid the Kiss of Death, it’s called.
SEA:
Plus Dex?
CARTE:
7… 8. Yep.
SEA:
Okay, you have a choice here. You see her coming in to kiss you and you could choose in this moment to… I’m trying to think what the hard move is. Okay, here’s what I’m gonna give you. You see in this moment when she goes to start kissing you… you see a dagger on her belt at her waist that you have never seen on her before. It is one of the most intricately carved daggers and it gleams as if otherworldly. And you just instantly know that it could do serious harm. It’s a significant weapon. So, in that moment of death, you have a choice. You can take the kiss and use that moment to try and grab that dagger or you can avoid the kiss but plummet down towards the ground because her arms are holding your wings.
CARTE:
We’ll plummet.
MICHAE:
Hm.
SEA:
Okay. You’re plummeting towards the ground. She’s just holding you as you plummet together, flipping end over end over end and you hit the ground. Roll 1d4 for me. We’ll both take this damage.
CARTE:
Is it the top number?
SEA:
Yeah, it’s the top.
CARTE:
It’s a 4.
SEA:
We both take 4. Okay? And you hit the ice with an explosion of shards in every direction.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh Blathoxil, you don’t yearn for my affection anymore do you?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Baby, you got real ugly.
SEA:
And she… you see the light glowing in her eyes as she’s looking into your face, still arms wrapped around you, lying in the pool of melting ice. And I need you to roll Defy Danger.
CARTE:
(rolling)
That’s an 8, plus Dexterity, is a 9.
SEA:
Okay, so you’re gonna take part of this. You manage to rip yourself free from her grip, stumbling backwards, but the glare strikes you… so I need you to roll 1d6. Half of it.
CARTE:
5.
SEA:
You take 5 damage.
CARTE:
Ouch.
SEA:
So you’re stumbling back away from her.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Now, Blat, why don’t we pause before I kill you and you give me the goddess that I want, that I yearn for, inside you, and just allow me to place it in this crystal or what’s left of it.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Or I could give you what every woman wants…
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ten million diamond rings.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Don’t do it!
BLAAAAT!

Fast-paced music plays.
The popping sound of Peri the fairy appearing.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, it’s you!
You’re not even a real fae.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know why we’re so acrimonious all the time.
SEAN (AS PERI)
No reason! I‑I don’t find you attractive at all!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We should probably go and have tea some time!
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
You! You, red one. What are you doing with my boys?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in his low, gruff Blathoxil voice)
The employer of your boys might actually be an evil clone.
A blast of energy and screaming as Celene disintegrates Mumsy’s boys.
MIKE (AS GOH)
Aaa! It burns! Aaaa!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
It was worth a shot.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Hello! I am merely a humble portal salesman.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m sorry, what did you say?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I’m wearing gloves for shoes! I have seen better days
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why can’t you use your own portal to run to a market square where you could get as much food as you want?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Buffet restaurant! Buffet restaurant! Buffet restaurant! Run!
He runs into the portal and disappears with a roar and a pop.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right, Celene. Here I come. Arrrrgh!
She runs into the portal too and disappears.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Blat. Why don’t we pause before I kill you, and you give me the goddess that I want and just allow me to place it in this crystal?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
(roars)
Don’t do it!
Blat!
EGGERTO:
The sound of busy car traffic.
SEA:
Eggerton is walking down a street, pushing his way through passerbys. And it’s very busy and crowded and everyone’s trying to get somewhere. Large vehicles spewing exhaust honk and try to make their way through. Shops selling every variety of strange good line the streets on both sides as Eggerton is trying to force his way through the crowd.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, hello! Hi! It’s nice to meet—okay, hi. Hello? Hoooonk to you too! It’s nice to see you! Uh, excuse me? Uh, no, okay, that’s all right. Uh, sir? Sir? Nope. Okay. Wow, they’re so tall! Um, okay.
(shouts)
Has anyone seen a fae stone? Hello?
SEAN (AS A SMALL CHILD)
Mommy, what’s that?
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
Uh, I don’t know.
SEAN (AS SMALL CHILD)
He’s a funny looking—oh, I shouldn’t say that.
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
Yes. Don’t say that.
SEAN (AS SMALL CHILD)
I’m sorry.
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
We don’t talk about people like that.
SEAN (AS SMALL CHILD)
I know. I know, I’m sorry. He’s very short.
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
Yes. Uh—hello, little person!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Hello. Well, average but hi. Hello. How are you?
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
Hello, average little person. Are you in trouble? Are you lost?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m a little lost. See, I came here on a date. And now I’m trying to get back to the fae stone so I can go prevent the end of time as well as the end of all existence. But I’m having a bit of trouble getting around here. There’s no eagle showing me the way. I tried talking to a squirrel but he just hissed at me—
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
Oh, oh, yes—
SEAN (AS SMALL CHILD)
Mommy. Mommy.
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
One moment, please. Yes, Timothy?
SEAN (AS SMALL CHILD)
(whispers)
He’s got bare feet.
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
Oh, yes, that’s very true. But he also seems to have something wrong with his brain. So we just want to step back a little.
SEAN (AS SMALL CHILD)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! What? Where are you going?
SEAN (AS SMALL CHILD)
Bye, strange man!
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
No, we’re not going anywhere. But you might want to try the park for that large stone you talking about.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The park? Which way’s the park?
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
It’s that way. Okay! We’ll see you! Nice to meet you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, okay, thank you! Hugs? No? Okay, no hugs.
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
No, no, no.
(whispers)
Run away, Timothy. Run away.
SEAN (AS SMALL CHILD)
Yes, Mommy. Okay.
MARISA (AS MOTHER)
Run away. Quicker.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, they were nice.

The End of Time and Other Bothers: an improvised fantasy role playing game set in the world of Alba Salix. Your Game Master is Sean Howard, with players Carter Siddall, Michael Howie and Marisa King.
Episode 25: Making and Breaking.
DARC:
SEA:
We return to the ice castle. A dark hallway leads on for far too long. Darcy pauses to catch her breath to try and gauge where she is in a hallway that is three to four times the length of what it could actually be to fit inside this castle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(panting)
I hope I got rid of that weird shadow person.
Ugh. How am I going to find where everyone is? They were… they were underground… and I have no idea which direction that is from here. I know, maybe if I find a window I Ican just get my bearings.
MARIS:
So is there a window in this corridor?
SEA:
You do see a window up ahead.
MARIS:
Okay, so I run up to the window and I look out. And do I see anything significant in terms of landmark or…?
SEA:
You see Peri.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(high, cheerful voice)
Hi!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… hello.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, hi. I was just looking for Eggerton. Ha ha.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! Eggerton? How do you know Eggerton?
SEAN (AS PERI)
No reason?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I mean, it’s fine. I think it’s great that you know Eggerton. I—
SEAN (AS PERI)
Really? You approve?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes! Very much so.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(laughing with relief)
Oh, he’s so cute! His little cheeks!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Very cute little cheeks. Um… Have you seen Eggerton recently?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yes!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You have!
SEAN (AS PERI)
(laughing)
Yes I did!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Where, may I ask?
SEAN (AS PERI)
(evasive again)
Nowhere. Nowhere. We weren’t—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no, I’m sure whatever you were doing was wonderful and exciting!
SEAN (AS PERI)
(laughing)
It was a little exciting.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Where would that have been?
SEAN (AS PERI)
At the place with the bucks and the stars?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! In the forest?
SEAN (AS PERI)
(laughs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(laughs along awkwardly)
SEAN (AS PERI)
No.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, no, no, that’s silly.
SEAN (AS PERI)
We had a latte.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! So you mean a cafe?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah! I just happened to be there. You know. I was just happening—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Is there a cafe in the basement?
SEAN (AS PERI)
(laughs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(laughs)
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, just Celene and death!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, yes. Well, that makes sense.
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, it was in the future. Well, your future, not my future.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wait, how—
SEAN (AS PERI)
It gets confusing. I get really confused. Because now would be my past, I guess? Maybe Eggerton—yeah, I don’t know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
How did you come from the future?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Just followed the fae stone.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The fae stone? Which fae stone?
SEAN (AS PERI)
You don’t know where the fae stones are?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, no, I don’t, not all of them.
SEAN (AS PERI)
You can’t feel them?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh… No?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Well, that’s sad.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s sad. Very sad. It would be wonderful if someone could help me feel them, or even find them…
SEAN (AS PERI)
Well, I don’t think I’m supposed to show you where the fae stone is.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, surely something as wonderful as a fae stone is meant to be shared with the world!
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, we’re not supposed to share it with the world.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uhh… shared with Eggerton’s good friends?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Well… I mean… I guess I could share it with Eggerton’s good friends.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I mean, think of it this way. If you show me where to find Eggerton, maybe you’ll run into him again!
SEAN (AS PERI)
(gasps)
But just by happenstance.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
A chance meeting. Aren’t those the best kind?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, I’m not trying to find him.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Not at all.
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, he’s going to call me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, I’m sure he will.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(softly)
He’d better.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes, I guarantee he will.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So could you take me to this cafe? Where you found him?
SEAN (AS PERI)
I don’t know. I could take you to the fae stone, but then you have to just like, think of the cafe, and you just follow it there, through the matrix.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So then you’ll have to describe it to me in great detail as we get to the fae stone.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh! I can do that. Oh my god, it was so amazing. And okay, so when you first walk in, you look around and you see Eggerton’s not there…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh huh. Oh, yeah? Really!
EGGERTO:
SEA:
We return to another busy street, this one even more crowded with lanes of traffic, with these very large fast-moving vehicles zipping, unheeding of anyone, past as Eggerton stands with a few people on a corner with—just on other side—a beautiful green park filled with trees.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Are you going to the park too? Isn’t it beautiful? It’s all green. And I think—I can feel the pull, it might be the fae stone there. It’s so exciting! Why are we standing here though? It’s just right there—
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Are you talking to me? Excuse me?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, yeah! Hi! Yeah! Yeah. I’m Eggerton.
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Um, yeah, great. I’m just on a phone call if you don’t mind.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What’s a phone call?
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Yeah, no, no, we need to sell.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What are we selling?
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Excuse me. Hold on.
(to Eggerton)
I’m sorry—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are you sorry?
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
I don’t know who you are.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m Eggerton.
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Yeah. I don’t care.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s not very nice.
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Yeah. And I’m very busy right now. If you don’t mind.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. No, I’m okay with that.
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Great.
(into the phone)
Yeah, sorry, Sarah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Who’s Sarah?
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
(sighs)
Yeah, no, I can’t move. I’m stuck at the lights.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t think you’re stuck. I mean, wait, is there—are your feet…? Hold on, let me check your feet. I’ll see if there’s anything under them.
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
This man is touching me—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(grunts with effort)
No, no, there’s a little bit of gum on this one, that shouldn’t be sticking you.
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
What are you doing? Don’t touch me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m seeing if you’re stuck! You said you were stuck. I want to help you.
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
I’m not stuck. If you would just put my foot down.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, there you go. What about the other one? Let me check the other one—
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Look, I’ll show you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Yeah!
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
See, I can lift it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so you’re not stuck.
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
No, I’m not stuck now. Thanks for your help.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shouts)
Sarah, he’s lying to you! He’s not stuck!
SEAN (AS IRRITABLE MAN)
Okay, I just actually realized I’m at the wrong place. I’m just going to go down this street. Nice meeting you. Bye!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It was nice to meet you too! Bye!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh, you are just delightful.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, thank you so much.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
I was watching your interaction with that very rude man. And I thought oh, it’s just so cheery and we don’t often see people like you who take time to interact with others.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It is sad that people here seem very very, you know, in a rush to get places.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
(groans)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And they keep walking to where they want to go and then stopping, complaining about stopping, waiting for a while and then continuing. Why don’t they just go?
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Well, there is a lot of traffic—oh, here, we can go now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Perhaps you could help me get across.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Of course I can help you get across! Here, let me take your arm. And here we go.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
We have to hurry.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why are we hurrying? We don’t need to hurry.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Well, the big cars will run—
SEA:
VROOOM!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We can take all our time—oh, that was loud.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Aaa! Ooh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That was fast. No, it’s okay, don’t worry.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
A little faster, a little faster.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We don’t need to go faster. It—whoa!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh! Oh! Oh my goodness.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That one was angry!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. And here we go. Other side.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh, thank you! You take your life into your hands every time you walk these roads.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you know, where I come from we prefer roads without these big angry machines. We have little machines that move pretty quickly. But you know, it’s very polite.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh, that sounds so nice.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It is nice.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
A quieter, slower time.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, not necessarily—I mean, there were a couple of, you know, alleged explosions.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So maybe not quieter. But it was maybe nicer. Except for all the Centurions. They were kind of mean and rude. They’d always be like, “Give me your ID!” But you know, I feel like it’s okay here. People seem kind of nice sometimes. You’re nice.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
You’re a writer, aren’t you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I like to think so.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh, you write fabulous stories!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasp)
Well, thank you.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Such an imagination you have!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you! I should have you talk to my boss, Karen. She never believes it.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh, well, anytime, young man. Anytime.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
I come to the park to get away from all the noise and awfulness.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ahhh. Well, you know what? I’m looking for a fae stone. Do you want to come with me and find it?
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Well, I can’t walk too quickly…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s okay! We can take our time.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Well, okay!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t have anywhere to be in an urgent manner. There’s no reason to hurry along and meet certain… reasons for speediness and expedition.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Well, there’s nothing wrong with being unemployed. That happens to all of us.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, no, I have a job. I have a job in the future. Well, I think it’s the past.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
You’re so positive. Of course you’ll have a job in the future.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I have a job in the future—
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
That is absolutely the attitude to have.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But I’m also a general. I’m actually part of the Defence League that is trying to prevent both the end of time, which we’ve kind of put on pause right now because we’re also trying to prevent the end of existence!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh my goodness. You know, my grandson plays these games where you you have little figures and you move them around and you pretend that you are dragons and there are all sorts of fantasy creatures…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
I always wanted to be a dragon! I’ve never met one.
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Well, you know, I think if you just choose to be a dragon, they’ll let you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Really!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
You just tell the people in the game with you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay, I’m gonna try and be a dragon. Ready?
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
(chuckling)
Okay! All right!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
One, two, three—RAARRRGH!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
(laughing)
Oh my goodness! You are just so much fun.
SEA:
Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling!
SEAN (AS ICE CREAM MAN)
Ice cream! Get your ice cream!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
What’s ice cream?
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
You don’t know what ice cream is?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No! Does it come in spicy? That’s always my favourite flavour.
SEAN (AS ICE CREAM MAN)
Ice cream!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh, no, it’s very sweet. You might want to get yourself one.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
Sweet like a fairy cake?
SEAN (AS ICE CREAM MAN)
Anybody want ice cream?
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Oh, a cake? Yes, it is like cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay! Let’s go get some!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
I will buy you one because you are unemployed and I want to help you get on your path to where you need to go in life.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That is so sweet of you.
SEAN (AS ICE CREAM MAN)
Ice cream!
MARISA (AS ELDERLY LADY)
Excuse me.
SEAN (AS ICE CREAM MAN)
Ah! Mrs. Fedelstein.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN THE ELDERLY LADY)
Oh, hello there Archie. How are you today?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE THE ICE CREAM MAN)
Pretty good. You know, the feet, a little tired, you know, but—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you want a foot massage?
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. He’s—he’s a little odd, this one. I just met him.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Ah. What can I get you Ms. Fedelstein?
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
I will have the chocolate vanilla twist.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Yup. I got ya, always got the—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ooooh.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Thank you.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
I’ll just take that off…
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Doesn’t that look good? Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That does look good.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
What would you like?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hmmm. Could I have one of these with sprinkles, sparkles, glitter, stripes in both directions, polka dots… and maybe just a little bit of fairy dust on top?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
It’s just one of the numbers. Just pick a number.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, okay. Um, 764.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
No, like on the side. Look, let me show you, come around.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Look, I got Number 1, which is what Mrs. Fedelstein has.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, that’s Number 1.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Number 2…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Number 2.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Number 3.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Number 3.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Or Number 4.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, which one has the most glitter?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
4.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right, I’ll take a Number 4, please!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Here you go.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Thank you, Archie. Here you are.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Thank you, Mrs. Fedelstein. Have a good day at the park.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
You too.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait. Wait. Do you have a little kitchen in there?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
No, it’s… it’s an ice box.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, but you’ve got like—I see some sprinkles. And that looks like maybe some sugar or something?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
I don’t tell anyone about the sprinkles—
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Okay! Why don’t we go find that stone you were talking about—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait wait wait!
(whispers)
I can make something.
Okay, watch out, I’m coming in, I’m coming in—
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
He’s climbing in! Mrs. Fedelstein, he’s climbing into my—what are you…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(stuck headfirst in the cart)
Okay, okay! Now I’m gonna take this bowl—
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
This is against regulations.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right, a little bit of this, and throw that in… Hello, Mr. Bowl! You’re different than my normal bowl. But you seem nice!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Sir, I—
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Archie. Archie. He is searching for a job. So maybe he’s just trying things out to see where he fits. You know?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And now a mixing spoon… and swirl that around, and some sprinkles… oh look, a pigeon! Pigeon, hello!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
He’s trying to put a pigeon in my cart!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I’m not putting it—I’m asking the pigeon if he wants to come help.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
No! No pigeons are allowed in this cart!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No? That seems kind of discriminatory.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
I’m sorry, but there are health codes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
There are health codes?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Yeah, I don’t think you should be in my cart with your feet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What’s wrong with my feet?
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Yes, young man, perhaps we should leave Archie to his route.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, it’s almost done. Just a little bit of this…
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Oh my.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
A little stirring counter-clockwise—okay. Now, everybody close your eyes. Close your eyes real quick.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Close your eyes.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
If it makes this end faster, sure.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay. I want everyone to think about something they love.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
People not in my cart.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, think really hard about that.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
(dreamily)
Rainbows.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Rainbows! Yeah, rainbows! Okay, and everybody go “Ooooo, fairy cakes!”
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Ooooo, fairy cakes!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Seriously?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Just do it.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
(without feeling)
Ooo, fairy cakes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And… open your eyes!
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Ooh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
A bowl full of fairy cakes!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Where did those come from?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I made them! You helped! With your love!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
What? Where did you—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why is this… this black one, I think that might be yours, sir. There you go. And look, Mrs. Fiddlestein!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Where did you have these?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Here’s a rainbow one! And look. We’ll put a couple sprinkles that I found.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Well, that’s just marvelous!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
(mutters)
I wouldn’t feed this to my dog.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. Okay, try it. Try it. I want to see if you like it. Try it. Try it.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Okay!
(eats it and smacks her lips)
SEA:
Roll for fairy cakes.
MIK:
That’s a… Oh, no, that’s an 8. Which means…
Laughter.
MIK:
I just drugged a stranger.
SEA:
So you are going to feel great, but…
Everyone you see is an animal dressed in the clothing of that person.
MARIS:
Okay.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Oh my goodness! I think my arthritis is gone!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What? Really?
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Wow!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s incredible.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Yes! I mean, I haven’t felt this good in my joints for ages!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wonderful!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
I don’t know if we—what’s in these? Have you drugged Mrs Fedelstein?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No! That’s just—
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Oh, I just—Archie! Oh my goodness!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
What?
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Oh! Archie, your face!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
What happened? What’s with my face?
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Well, the horse! The horse face!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh…
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Oh! Archie, what is happening to you?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
What have you done to Mrs. Fedelstein?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, no, it’s okay. Sometimes the fairy cakes take a bit of a turn—
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Officer? Officer!
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
Yes, perhaps we should call the authorities.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Officer!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
Okay, what is is this? Another ice cream-related mishap?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
I’m afraid so.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello, officer! My name is Eggerton. How are you today?
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
Okay, you’re obviously a homeless dwarf…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
Why don’t you have shoes?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Where’s the dwarf?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
This man, I think I believe he may have drugged this little old woman. My friend, Mrs Fedelstein.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, no, no, I didn’t drug her. I just gave her a fairy cake and it’s taken a bit of a turn, that happens sometimes—
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
Okay, what’s the street lingo here? “Fairy cake”? What’s that mean.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, it’s just—look, here! Try one.
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
I’m not gonna just eat something that—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s okay, have a fairy cake!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
(choking noises)
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
What are you doing?!
SEA:
Roll for fairy cakes.
Laughter.
MIK:
(laughing)
It’s an 8 again.
SEA:
So the policeman is having the most amazing experience of his life. But he is…?
We’re looking at Marisa…
MARIS:
Oh no. Um… He thinks he’s in a large body of water.
SEA:
(laughing)
He thinks he’s in a large body of water.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
What—you can’t just go shoving things down people’s throats!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m not shoving it. I’m putting it up for them to try, and then they eat it.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Okay, but just get down off my cart. Get off my cart.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m gonna get off the cart.
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
What have you done to Officer Fox?
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Are you okay?
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
I think I’m fine. What I want to know is—why are you flooding the city?! Why are you flooding the city?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, okay, I’ve seen this one before. Okay…
You’re on a boat! It’s a calm sea!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
I’m not—this is an ice cream cart!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
No, get off my cart! No!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
Everyone on the cart! Everyone on the cart!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait! It’s okay, it’s okay!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
I’m fine—we just have to all get on the cart. You! Across the street! You’re gonna be killed! You’re gonna die!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay! Everyone’s okay! There’s no extra water. The fairy cake’s just making you feel a little extra right now.
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
I’m getting out my gun!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No! Whoa! What’s that?
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
All right! Now! We have to choose quickly. Who are the important people in society?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This is going dark!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
The cart can only fit three of us!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh oh. All right. I gotta go.
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
It’s my cart! I own the cart!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
Your cart? Get on the cart!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
All right!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
You’re a small business owner—we’ll need that in the future! Ma’am?
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
My arthritis is better. I think I can be of some use in the new civilization…
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
All right, Ma’am, up you come.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay. Everything’s okay—
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
He’s the one who did this!
CARTER (AS POLICEMAN)
Criminal! Criminal!
Gunshots.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh geez! All right! Okay, you guys have a nice day! I’m gonna go find the fae stone. Okay, bye! Bye now!
MARISA (AS MRS. FEDELSTEIN)
(sobbing)
DARC:
SEA:
We return to the corridor that goes on and on. And Darcy is walking along, looking a little concerned as Peri hovers in the air beside her, talking, well, incessantly.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(dreamily)
And then there was the scones—oh, but I couldn’t figure out which flavour. But that’s when he came in. Oh, just the tinkle of the door. And then just seeing his little rosy cheeks—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I… I think I have a really clear picture now of of where you were. Because you’ve been so descriptive and—
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, that’s right! I was explaining to you. Ha ha ha!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS PERI)
That’s enough? Are you sure. Because I haven’t really told you about like where we sat, or where he touched the table…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I think it’s good. I mean, you described the sign—
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, the sign!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The sign outside was very helpful.
SEAN (AS PERI)
I did good? Okay, good.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, you really described the outside a lot because that’s how nervous you were to go in at first.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, I was, I was real nervous.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Because I was like, what if he’s already there? I wanted to be there first. And then I was like, but what if he thought to be their first ahead of me? It was really hard.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Right.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
It’s a… quandary. That’s for sure. Those types of things.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Dating’s horrible.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, tell me about it.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Not that we’re dating! You know, we’re not official or anything like, you know what I mean? He may not call, it’s cool. Cool cool. Cool cool cool.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. You just gotta play it cool, right?
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, I’m gonna kill him if he doesn’t call me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, that too.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So how long until the fae stone?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh wait! We’re going to the fae stone!
(laughs)
Oh right! We were just talking so much. Uhhhh… where are we in the corridor? Hold on, hold on. Oh, we can still get there. We can still get there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, that’s great. Um, I feel like I gotta get to Eggerton quickly.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh right!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know what he’s up to.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Why? Why do you have to get to Eggerton?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, because… we don’t like being apart for very long!
SEAN (AS PERI)
What… He doesn’t like being apart from you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, well, no—because we’re just really good friends. That’s it. That’s all that’s going on
SEAN (AS PERI)
How good friends?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uhh… not that good.
SEAN (AS PERI)
But he doesn’t like being away from you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, because I’m sort of a…
SEAN (AS PERI)
Girlfriend?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I do his shopping for him.
SEAN (AS PERI)
You… you what?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I do his shopping for him.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, so you like, work for him!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, that’s right.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(laughing)
Oh! I’m sorry. I’m just a little jealous, you know.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, of course.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I don’t know why I thought that—just that you’re with him all the time. And he talks about you—
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah. He almost doesn’t like me, really, it’s just… he likes food and I do the shopping and so I get him the food and that’s that’s all our connection is.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What does he like?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Uh… you. I’m sure.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Has he mentioned me?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, I haven’t seen him for a long time, remember. This is why I need to catch up.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, right, right! Yeah, okay, so…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But I can mention you a lot when I see him.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(bashful)
Oh, okay…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah, so, I’ll put in a good word.
SEAN (AS PERI)
But don’t make it obvious.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, not at all.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Not unless he talks about me first. Well, maybe you could work it in a little to remind him if he’s not talking about me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Absolutely. I can do that.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay. Okay, so—oh! Here, we’re here! Ha ha.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Wow! Here it is!
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah, we took three lefts on this corridor that doesn’t end and… so now, okay… Oh.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What’s wrong?
SEAN (AS PERI)
(whispers)
Um, I’m not supposed to be seen with you.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
Why not?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Because you’re not supposed to—you’re not supposed to be in here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I think that… depends on your point of view!
CARTER (AS ANOTHER FAE)
Hello, Peri!
SEAN (AS PERI)
H‑hello! Hello, Billian.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
So! Break almost over?
SEAN (AS PERI)
(laughing nervously)
Yeah! Yeah, I was just, um, walking down this hall and oh, look who it is!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Hello.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Hello.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
You’re big.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ve been told that.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
I don’t think she’s allowed to be here!
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, no. What? Really?
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
I… I think so.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, my God. What should we do, Billian?
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Um… I could sound the alarm!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! There’s no need for alarm-sounding. I was just leaving! Wasn’t I, Perry?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah. Yeah. She wanted to know how to leave. I was going to show her the way through the—I mean, not through the fae stone. I just was going to take her back the other way.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
So she’s not a fairy, so she can’t go through the fae stone!
SEAN (AS PERI)
Right! Right, right. I was gonna to take her down the hall to the Jester.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
The Jester?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Oh, the Jolly Jester is not very jolly.
SEAN (AS PERI)
No.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Quite ironic.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah. So, uh—
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
This feels like an alarm-sounding situation.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No! I actually was let in by two fairies on your drawbridge. Uh, everything’s fine.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Oh, I thought we had three out there now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I think that might be true? Maybe they need four!
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Hmmm…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Then two could look one way and two could look the other. Three seems like an uneven number to me.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Celene doesn’t want to be you know, disturbed right now. Right? She’s killing, you know, the Chosen One in the basement and you wouldn’t want to disturb her—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
W… what? Excuse me? I’m sorry, what did you say about Celene?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh, she’s killing the Chosen One in the basement right now. She wouldn’t want to be disturbed, right?
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
No, she’s been looking forward to that, yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. So you know, she may be a little angry. So maybe we should just keep it quiet and we’ll just—we’ll just usher her out.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Well, if I go on to the front, and I’m one of the four…. you’re gonna have to go to the back and be one of the four there. But then what to do with the big one…
SEAN (AS PERI)
Right…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Why don’t you just take me to a lower level, near the basement?
SEAN (AS PERI)
Or we could freeze her?
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Oh! Freezing her! I haven’t done that lately.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No, I don’t like freezing.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Yeah.
(whispers)
Sorry. I don’t know what to do, I was panicking.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, I‑I think that you guys should just take me back to where I came—just take me outside of the castle and I’ll be on my way and I won’t disturb anyone any longer.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
So I’ll contact Catering and see if they have anything we can freeze her with.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay! We’ll wait here.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
All right! Just a moment.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay. Thank you.
(whispers)
Peri.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(whispers)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
I need to get to the basement.
SEAN (AS PERI)
I thought we were going to the fae stone! It’s right here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, um, I feel like now I need to get to the basement. Is there a fae stone down there?
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, no, this is the fae stone in the castle.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But Peri, your friend was right. I can’t use the fae stone. I’m not a fairy.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh. Oh, I didn’t—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And then you’d have to come with me and then they’d know you weren’t on guard in the back. And I feel like there might be questions that would make it awkward for you. I think what would be less awkward for you, is if you just get me to the basement.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay, but that’s past Catering.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, well, there isn’t a way around Catering?
SEAN (AS PERI)
No, you have to go right through Catering.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, maybe I could sneak through.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay… um…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, so if you can just show me the way then of course I’m going to tell Eggerton that you helped his personal shopper get to where she needed to go, and he’s just gonna be so happy about that.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Oh really? Okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS PERI)
You sure you don’t want to stop at the fae…? Okay, okay, we’ll just—he’s probably not there.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh, he might have already gone off somewhere else. He’s always flitting around, that Eggerton! Ha ha.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(quietly)
Is that a euphemism?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
…yes?
SEAN (AS PERI)
So he… he has a lot of girls?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh! Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, I don’t mean that. I just mean he just flits to and fro as fairies do.
SEAN (AS PERI)
(relieved)
Oh. Oh, okay.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Allright, well, we’ll just follow Billian down to catering.
SEAN (AS PERI)
Okay, why don’t you go ahead of me and I’ll follow you and…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, great. Okay, so just follow me!
SEA:
And she pops out of existence.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(sighs)
Well, good news and bad news.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
All right! I have three bags of ice. We can freeze her with—
Hello? Hello?
I never get to freeze anyone.
Laughter.
MIDROL:
ANNOUNCE:
Ooh! Ooh! It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers!
SEA:
Hey, everyone, it’s Sean. And I just want to say how awesome it is to be back and to have this table coming back together again. We are having so much fun and thank you so much for being with us on this journey. And I want to give a special shout out to some of you who have supported us or raised your donations! That is so amazing, and helps us keep going and keep creating this show.
First of all, I want to give a thank you to Lana—I hope I got that right. And Victoria Snyder. Thank you so much. And I also want to keep working my way through the oldies but the goodies! I need a better name for those still. So let’s give a shout out to Oz Osborne, Person #42—Mottel! Eddie Kristan and Jacob H. Thank you all so much. And for everyone else who’s listening and sharing this, or reviewing this in iTunes it means so much.
And now I want to give a shout out to a show that has captured my soul. I cannot stop listening to Caravan. It is an audio fiction serialized drama. It is not an actual play but I love it. It is a beautifully told story—I don’t even know how to explain it. It’s like a fantasy meets an old Western but it’s modern. And it’s told from the point of view of a character that we don’t often hear from in entertainment and in media. And it’s got gay relationships and romance and I love it and I can’t get enough. Check out Caravan—you will not regret it.
And I also want to say thank you to everyone that’s checked out our new show Civilized, our fully-improvised dark comedy sci-fi show. We really appreciate you all listening and giving us that boost and those reviews are so amazing.
And hey, I’m done talking. Let’s get back to the show.
SKETCH: UNION MEETIN:
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Okay, welcome to meeting to start union in honour of my two boys whose greatest dream it was to be unionize—
SEAN (AS STAR)
(giggling)
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Hey! What’s the laughing about?!
SEAN (AS STAR)
Sorry!
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Okay, none of that. It’s sad that Goh and Rothkar no longer with us.
SEAN (AS STAR)
(giggling)
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
And we continue this in their honour even though I did not believe in unioning.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
But it is important to honour their memory.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Very important. Here are cookies.
CARTER (AS FAE)
Ooooh!
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
Oooh. Thank you.
SEAN (AS STAR)
(giggling)
Maybe we should send another group to go and speak to Celene about the union demands!
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Too soon! Too soon.
SEAN (AS STAR)
Yeah, no, good point.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
Okay, I’d like to stand and say words.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Please do.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
As ice monster people look down on me.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Well, they mostly look up.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
They technically look up at me because I am so giant and made of ice.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Yes.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
But Rathkar—nope.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Rothkar.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
Rothkar.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Yes.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
And Goh. They always looked at me like a monster first.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Oh, that gets me right here.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
They did not see me as what they call an “NPC” in some circles. They saw me as me.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Yes, that is them!
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
They were wonderful souls.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
They were. They flipped too many tables, but they were good boys.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
Too many tables.
SEAN (AS STAR)
(sniffling)
I didn’t expect to be—I’m not feeling anything!
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
It’s okay. We’re all a little sad today.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Now let’s try be happier and talk about what we need in union. You over here! What do you think?
CARTER (AS FAE)
Well, I just got this notice from Celene.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Oh.
CARTER (AS FAE)
She said if we disband the union immediately, she’ll give us a .5% raise. All in favour?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER FAE)
Oh. Aye?
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Uh… yeah. Seems less trouble.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
Uh, I have a math question.
CARTER (AS FAE)
Okay.
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
Um. When you take .5…
CARTER (AS FAE)
Uh huh?
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
And you add it to zero… does that mean we’re going you get paid?
CARTER (AS FAE)
Do you get fed?
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
Uh, I get to eat the wayward adventurers…
CARTER (AS FAE)
\.5% more!
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
Oh! I’m on board with that.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER FAE)
Me too! Where do we sign?
MIKE (AS ICE MONSTER)
All right. Aye.
CARTER (AS FAE)
So we dissolve the union at our first meeting! Again I’m very sorry for your boys.
MARISA (AS MUMSY)
Thank you.

Music sting.
EGGERTO:
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
(absurd Arnold Schwarzenegger voice)
I can’t believe it! Stuck homeless again. Why? Why did I choose to just pop in for one meal? I’m so hungry…
(sobs)
Eggerton runs up, screaming in panic.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaaaa!
SEAN (AS ARCHIE)
Hello?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(breathless)
Wha? Who are you?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Oh! My name is Gulhart.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Guildhurt?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Gilhart.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Gillhod?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Gilhart.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Sure!
I’m Eggerton!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Hello!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Do you see any little metal things flying past me? There was a lot of them but I think I outran them.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Are you talking about automobiles?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No! Those are angry though, aren’t they?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Ahh, you get used to them.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Really? I don’t think I could get used to those.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Yeah, they’re around this area quite a bit.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, no, these were like little flies that came out of this black contraption that an angry man had, and they kept trying to like, bite me but I got away from them.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You are talking crazy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I know, it sounds crazy! But nonetheless, here I am!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I am not comfortable with crazy people. I am not crazy. What I am doing is I’ve come back here to try and construct my magical branch portal.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
A magical branch portal?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Here in the park is the one place in the entire multiverse that has a special tree that allows me to create the circular portal. I am not a crazy person!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That sounds like the most rational thing I’ve heard in days.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Thank you!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so where does the tree come from?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
The tree is here in the park.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Here in the park?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Yes, this park.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This very park!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
This very park, yes!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Let’s go, new friend, and find your tree!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
It’s just here.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
This one?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Is right here, yeah.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The one we are standing next to right now is the magic tree?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I have run out of food again. I left my own portal in a different time period so now I have to build this one here now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, so how much wood do you need?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
It’s not much, it’s just strips, and then you got to curve them.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The strips?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You’ve got to curve into a circle.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Okay, well, this is a big tree.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You just strip it down—don’t let anybody see you strip it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Because then they will know this is the magic portal tree branch.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
They will. I mean, if I was walking by and I saw someone pulling small twigs off the tree to bend and form into a portal shape, I’d go “Ohhh! That’s a magical portal tree!”
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You and I are thinking together now. I’m sorry I called you a crazy person.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s okay! It’s okay. The people here are a little off if you know what I’m saying.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
It is quite high energy. I blame the caffeine.
SEAN (AS A PASSERBY)
He ran that way! I saw him run that way!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Um. So there may be some of those weird people coming. So what we’re going to do real quick—I’m going to find a way to get as much of this down as I can. Then we’re going to build a portal, then we’re going to go to the fae stone with the portal, and then we’re going to go through it together. Okay?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I just want a way to make money.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah! We’ll do that too. We’ll do that too. But you know—here. Okay, here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to try and climb this tree.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Uh huh?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ready? Okay, give me a boost.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Oh, I boost you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You boost. Ready? One… two… three…
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
(at the same time)
Eins… zwei… fling!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Waagh! Okay, I got a branch!
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
All right?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But it’s still attached to the tree.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
No, I need it off the tree. It doesn’t work then.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Can you reach my toes?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Yeah, I—
They both dissolve into ticklish laughter.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Ja, it’s fun, but I don’t know why it’s helping.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay, pull. Pull my feet.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Pull your feet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
Straining and struggling.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Down! Down! Down!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(panting)
Okay. Here’s the branch. I got the branch.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Okay, strip it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Strip it?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You strip it. You have to strip it good.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, can you, like, lay down a fat beat for me while I do this? I kinda need to get into a rhythm.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
This is quite an unfortunate request but I will certainly attempt to honour it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I feel that with your, with your… ducal tones, that it will be perfect for tree-stripping.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Gerhart will do this for you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
All right, here we go.
(clumsy but vigorous beatboxing, with much spitting)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, yeah. Okay, that’s tree-stripping music, all right. Uh huh. Uh huh. Check it out. Check it out.
I’m strippin’ a tr—
SEAN (AS POLICEMAN)
Excuse me.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
SEAN (AS POLICEMAN)
Excuse me, have you two rappers seen anybody run past here?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Uh, yes… a little old lady ran past the other direction.
SEAN (AS POLICEMAN)
Thank you. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No problem.
(whispers)
That was one of the weird ones.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Oh, I’m terribly sorry, it’s a good thing they didn’t stop. Okay, back to portal stripping.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay!
Uh! Un un uh! Strip the tree, strip the tree, strip the tree. Aaaand—
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
No, is thinner! Thinner! It is much thinner. You can’t make it too thick or it doesn’t work, I don’t know why.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay! I’m sorry, my fingers are a little sweaty and clammy from all the running and the climbing. And my fingers, I dunno, they’re kind of fat and short. I always felt—now, you’ve got long, luxurious fingers.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You’re welcome. Why am I stripping the branches? If you got those like, you’ve got artisinal hands—
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
You offered.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I did offer… Why don’t you take over? I’ll do the phat beat and you do the tree-stripping rap?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
All right. This has to be half the size it is now. All right.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, ready?
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Here we go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And—oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz—
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
No, it’s too fast!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Too fast! Too fast! Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
This is a delicate operation!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, ready? Okay.
(gently)
Ba bap bap bap ba… ba bap bap bap ba…
SEA:
(giggling)
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I like this. It’s happy.
See, this is half the size. Then you have to tie them together. But you also have to make a circle. You can’t do that if it is too hard and thick!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ba bap bap bap ba… Do you often find branches are too hard and thick for you? Ba bap bap bap ba…
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I think you are trying to say something naughty but I am not going to take the bait.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(laughing)
Ba bap bap bap ba…
SEA:
We cut to 25 minutes later, and Eggerton is holding a perfectly formed, round shaped branch-like portal device.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You know what would be even more fun than using this as a portal? Watch. Okay, I’m gonna, I’m gonna put it over my head and around my waist and I’m gonna start spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning—
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
Don’t do that! Then half of you will go to another dimension!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
—and spinning and spinning and—whoaaaaaaaah!
Laughter.
CARTER (AS PORTAL SALESMAN)
I don’t even know why he was thinking of going!
I’ve lost my dear friend! The only one who has ever understood me!
(sobbing)
I have a portal… and yet I have nothing.
DARC:
SEA:
We return to that endless corridor, and Darcy is advancing slowly. Ahead of her are two double-swing doors and on the other side, she can hear the sounds of a kitchen at work.
MARIS:
So I tiptoe up to these doors.
SEA:
Okay.
MARIS:
And what can I hear going on?
SEA:
You hear orders being shouted, you hear plates being set down, you hear frying and pans. You here a kitchen serving a large volume of meals.
CARTER (AS A COOK)
Who used all the ice? Where’s the ice?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER COOK)
I don’t know! Put another order in. Order up!
MARIS:
Okay, so first of all, I look around this corridor. Do I see any doors that might lead to a basement?
SEA:
As you say those words… you see a door.
MARIS:
Wow. So I go towards the door…
SEA:
And a popping sound happens behind you.
MARIS:
And I spin around to see…?
SEA:
You see half of Eggerton sticking out of the floor.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What—?
MARIS:
…which half?
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(muffled)
Can anyone help? My feet are stuck in something? Hello? Someone there?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy, what are you doing?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are you doing?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m stuck! I was hula-hooping through a dimensional portal. And I think it like, activated and I went through but not all the way. So now I feel I can’t see anything but my feet are like, I can feel the air with my feet. But I can’t see anything or move.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
This just sounds like a normal day for you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah. It’s been a bit weird. A little weird.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, what if I try and pull you?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay. Okay, try to grab my leg.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, here I am. I’m grabbing.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaaaa! That was scary. Okay, that was you, right? That was you grabbing my leg?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That was me!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, do it again. Do it again. Sorry if I kicked you. And—whooaaa!
(he emerges, panting)
Whew! How you doing, Darcy?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
I’m good, but keep your voice down!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(not keeping his voice down)
Why am I keeping my voice down?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(whispers)
Because we’re in Celene’s ice castle!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We’re in Celene’s ice castle?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shhhhh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh, no, it’s okay, everyone calm… calm down…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shhhh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, what’s the sit rep on the recon—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You tell me!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
—of the attack module strategeos…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You tell me what the sit rep is! I hear that Blat’s under attack downstairs and you’re flitting through different dimensions? You were supposed to be with him!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well I was, and then I died?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
And then I went to this awesome party…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You would not believe the things I saw.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You died?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, it was cool. And then I went on a very nice date. It was a very nice first date with a nice young fairy—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
With Peri?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You know Peri?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yeah. Peri’s obsessed with you, just so you know. And not nice obsessed. I think slightly dangerously obsessed. So just watch your step.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I dunno, Peri seemed pretty nice to me.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Listen!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think Blat’s in trouble. We’ve got to get down to the basement!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
The basement where?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Of this castle!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
We want to go into the basement of a goddess’s castle?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We have to help Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Where’s Blat?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Down in the basement!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Here.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes! Where you left him!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I didn’t leave him here. Well, technically, I guess I left him here but it was a tunnel connected to here? So it was here-adjacent.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
We need to get to the tunnel. So do you know how to get to the tunnel?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ummm. I dunno, is it that door?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, let’s try it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
MARIS:
So I go over to this door that Eggerton pointed to.
SEA:
The door that appeared when you thought of it.
MARIS:
Yes.
SEA:
Like the window.
MARIS:
Yes?
MIK:
(whispers)
What window?
MARIS:
So… can I open this door?
SEA:
Yeah.
MARIS:
Okay, so I open the door.
SEA:
You see… The door creaks open and you see steps going down into the blackness.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
See, there you go! Basement. Let’s roll. You first.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right. Um…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait, is that the sound of a kitchen?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No. No. We don’t have time for the kitchen, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, it’s just, I had to make these fairy cakes. I’ve got this mixing bowl but I lost my pouch. So I need to get a new pouch. I’ve got fairy cakes to go for a while. It’s kind of awkward to carry them—
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, just put them in my satchel.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! You have a satchel?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, here you go. I’m going to keep a couple in my pockets.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s probably a good idea with you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
All right, and one behind my ear. This one’s long and skinny so it fits. And I’m going to just tip them into…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
All right. All right. I can’t take the bowl though.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aw, I like this bowl.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re gonna have to leave it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t want to leave—oh wait, what if I wear it as a helmet?
SEA:
(laughs)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Fine. That’s fine.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
General… Eggerton!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
The other hat was better, but okay.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It was better, but I didn’t pack it. That’s sad.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, come on. We need to go down these stairs.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Wait, wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, wait. Wait.
I want to have a fairy cake first.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Are you sure that’s a good idea?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, I feel like, you know, I’m a little bruised and my arm’s a bit sore from where the troll tried to eat me…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I can’t afford to have you dopey or drunk or stumbly or anything else that’s not just on-the-mark, ready-to-go Eggerton right now.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Why would I be anything other than on-the-mark, ready-to-go General Eggerton?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Because your fairy cakes have side effects.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Sometimes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
A lot of the time.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Some of the time.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I think more than some of the time.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, it depends on how we wanted to define “some” and “more” mathematically.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Okay, just… just have a fairy cake. Take a fairy cake.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, okay, I’m gonna have this one. This is like a knockoff purple swirly made of ingredients. It’s not purple, but I imagine purple? That was my happy thought in my love when I was making it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Did you say knockoff?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, no, no, no, no, no. It’s a fairy cake.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re going to take a knockoff fairy cake?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yeah, don’t worry. Here, I’m just gonna eat it.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No—ughh.
SEA:
Roll for Fairy Cakes at a minus 1.
MIK:
Minus 1. Oh no!
SEA:
But you’ll add any pluses you have.
MIK:
I have +3 now, so…
SEA:
So you’re at +2.
He rolls. Laughter.
MIK:
Incidentally, it’s an 8.
SEA:
So you’re healed for… you get the plus on that, what was it? +3 on the damage, or the restoration.
MIK:
Restoration, which I’ve not done in a while. Um… I’m just gonna roll 2d6 and see what happens.
SEA:
No, I think it’s a—isn’t it a d8?
MIK:
It doesn’t say.
(reads)
“When you feed someone one of your fairy cakes, sweets or nom-noms… roll +Wisdom. On a 10+ blah bla blah, heal them for d8—” All right. You know what? Smartass. With your facts.
Laughter.
SEA:
It’s amazing what happens when you read your sheet!
MIK:
I get… 7 hit points back! Full health.
SEA:
+Wisdom.
MIK:
+Wisdom is + 1. So I go to full.
SEA:
I thought you said you had a +3 on the roll? Is that for some other reason? I’m confused.
MIK:
That’s on the Fairy Cake roll.
SEA:
Okay.
MIK:
And then +Wisdom for healing.
SEA:
How do you get +3 on the roll?
MIK:
Isn’t that for Charisma?
(reads)
Oh, it’s for Wisdom. Oops!
SEA:
You’ve been increasing Charisma all this time when you need to increase Wisdom.
Laughter.
MIK:
(laughing)
It’s fine. Everything’s fine.
MARIS:
And you’re not even that charismatic!
MIK:
Ohh! Rude. Nonetheless, I’m at full HP.
SEA:
And really beautiful.
MIK:
Yeah!
SEA:
And… you are stoned.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Eggerton. Do you feel better?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
Why are you so loud?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’m not being loud. I’m being quiet.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(loudly)
What?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Argh! Side effects, side effects, side effects! I knew it!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(hearty, stoned laughter)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Shhhh! Be quiet!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Shhhh! This is Celene’s castle. Why are you being so loud and immature?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Let’s just—let’s just get through the door!
MARIS:
And I drag him through the doorway.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Whoaa!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Come on!
SEA:
Okay, so the door closes behind you, as Darcy drags Eggerton, mumbling and laughing, down the stairs.
CARTER (AS BILLIAN)
Uh, hello? Ice? I thought the ice person came—aw, it was nothing.
BLA:
SEA:
We return to a giant ice cave with a stuttering giant crystal flickering madly, with blue light across the surface, as it beats erratically, as if at the end of its existence, struggling to not shatter. Beside it, floating in the air, is the goddess Celene in all her glory. And she is but a few feet away from Blat, with his wings flapping madly as he aims his bazooka at the crystal… and defiantly presses the trigger.
And the crystal… well, let’s roll damage please.
MARIS:
Don’t we need to roll for hitting first?
SEA:
Well, it’s Volley. Let’s roll to hit, actually. Thank you, Marisa!
MARIS:
No problem.
SEA:
So let’s roll to hit. Let’s roll Volley to hit.
MIK:
So much rolling.
SEA:
And you get a plus on this for your Dex.
CARTE:
8.
SEA:
Okay, so on a 7 to 9, that’s a partial success.
Okay, you have a couple choices. “You have to move to get the shot, placing you in even greater danger”—I don’t know how that’s possible. “You have to take what you can get: minus 1d6 damage. Or you have to take several shots: reduce your ammo.” But you don’t have ammo, we don’t do that. So…
CARTE:
I’ll decrease my damage by 1.
SEA:
1d6.
MARIS:
Ha!
CARTE:
1d6! So possibly no damage at all.
SEA:
So you put yourself in greater damage or… you take what you can get and it’s minus 1d6 damage.
CARTE:
No, I can’t put myself at any greater danger.
MARIS:
Yeah.
SEA:
Okay, so you’re gonna do minus 1d6.
CARTE:
So I’ll just roll one…
SEA:
So you’re flapping madly backwards as you fire, and you just—the shell goes a little short of its target. Let’s roll damage.
CARTE:
5.
SEA:
Now roll a six-sided die and…
CARTE:
Subtract that.
MIK:
Come on 1.
CARTE:
2.
MARIS:
So it’s 3.
SEA:
The blast roars outward… it probably can be heard for anyone that happened to be nearby. Flame rolling outward, ice slowly melting and dripping down, sending a cascade of water as the crystal emerges from the flame, still standing…
And then it ruptures, shooting shards in every direction, the blue light suddenly extinguished, plunging the entire chamber into darkness, except…
The eyes not 20 feet away open and are blood-red. And a red light begins to fill the chamber as Celene begins to grow in size.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Not what I was expecting.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh Blathoxil. My little Blathoxil. You have no idea what you’ve done. You will spend a lifetime in agony, feeling yourself destructing over and over when I am done with you. You will feel the full brunt of my anger.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look, it’s Blat, Darcy!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hey Blat! Blat! Over here, buddy!
SEA:
Two tiny figures emerge from a side passageway, the door closing behind them, off, far down below you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well, I was right. We are going to die together.
OUTTAK:
SEA:
It’s a busy street with people walking, carrying bags…
I’m gonna start that again.
CARTE:
They’re not carrying bags. That was stupid.
Laughter.
SEA:
That was so stupid. F——Sean, come on. Come on!
It’s a busy street. The smell of diesel, and it’s a sunny day as large vehicles honk and make their way down this busy…
The busy street that’s already a busy street.
MARIS:
(laughs)
It’s really busy.
MIK:
It’s like, you guys don’t even know super busy this street is.
CARTE:
But no one was carrying bags.
Music sting.

A Fable and Folly production."
"26: Immortal Combat","THE ICE CAVER:
SEA:
We are plunging down through the ice into a giant cavern, lit with a glowing redness emanating from the eyes of Celene, who has grown to four times her size, fire and lightning spiralling off of her form… as she glares down at Blat, who is hovering in the air less than 25 feet away, having just destroyed the crystal at the bottom of the cavern.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Blat! You have no idea what you’ve done.
(laughs)
Let me tell you! No, speak not, my Blathoxil. You have destroyed the only mechanism by which I could have removed Morrigu from your soul. Wait! What is this, Blat?
SEA:
And the goddess zooms closer to the hovering Blat, his wings flapping madly to keep him in the air.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, look at this! You are a vessel.
SEA:
And her hand reaches out hovering over the symbol of Loxsyn on Blat’s chest.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, priceless. Morrigu is trapped inside you! Perhaps I have found a replacement for my diamond vessel.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in his low, growling Blathoxil voice)
So you want me to become a diamond vessel?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh not become. You are!
SEA:
And she spreads her arms and Blat, you are struck with a pain that makes you arch your back so far back that it is as if it is going to snap. And you are lifted high up to the top of the cavern without your wings even beating, and you are held there in mobile unable to move.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You are the vessel through which I will drink Morrigu and become the most powerful goddess in the universe.
(laughs)
Isn’t that lovely, Blat?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(straining)
I could do without it.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
But first, first! My manners! We have guests.
SEA:
And the form spins and moves at high speed down towards the floor. lighting up the entrance in front of which stand Eggerton and Darcy.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What—what is that? What is that thing coming towards us?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(stoned laughter)
Duuuude!
Theme music plays.

THE ICE CAVER:
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
When did you get so big?! This is amazing. She’s huge! That can’t just be me. Right? Everyone else is seeing…? Hey! Hey! Hey, can everyone else see how big she got?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What—who is that?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
That’s Celene! Look at her!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
That’s Celene?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Look at the eyes!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh my gosh.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She’s all red now.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! Blat, are you okay!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Don’t worry. I have a helmet!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh no…
SEA:
And with that she gestures, and Eggerton is frozen.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hurk!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
I will learn all you know.
SEA:
And she closes her hand into a fist, and you see dark energy, Darcy, streaming out of Eggerton’s eyes as if his entire essence is being pulled out of his being through his eyes.
And the first memory that Celene receives is…?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
But Mommy, I want to make fairy cakes on my own!
EGGERTON’S CHILDHOOD APARTMEN:
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Mommy? I‑I found this book under your bed and I want to try making the fairy cakes.
SEAN (AS EGGERTON’S MOTHER)
Eggerton, I don’t have… Eggerton, Mommy has a headache. You need to just leave Mommy alone. Go do whatever you want to do.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
O‑okay. I’ll go talk to the snails on the roof again.
SEAN (AS EGGERTON’S MOTHER)
Whatever, Eggerton, whatever.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(sighs)
Oh, if only I had some friends.
MARISA (AS A SNAIL)
Hello, Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Hello, Thomas the Snail. How are you?
MARISA (AS A SNAIL)
I am fine. How are you today? You seem sad.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I am sad. My mom’s got another headache.
MARISA (AS A SNAIL)
Oh, she always has the headaches.
CARTER (AS A GRASSHOPPER)
That’s because of alcoholism!
Laughter.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
It’s sad. And it makes me want to cry. But then if I cry, they yell at me. I can’t cry. So I have to pretend that I’m not sad.
MARISA (AS A SNAIL)
That’s very hard to do.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’m sure it won’t carry any weight into the future.
CARTER (AS A GRASSHOPPER)
Busy hands make it light work! Maybe instead, you should do something to take your mind off it.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
What a good idea Mr. Grasshopper! Why don’t I—
SEAN (AS EGGERTON’S MOTHER)
(shrill shout from inside)
Eggerton! Get me a drink!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay! Okay, I gotta go guys. I gotta go.
MARISA (AS A SNAIL)
Okay! Keep your chin up.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I’ll do my best.
THE ICE CAVER:
SEA:
We return to the floor as a four-storey-tall Celene is drinking in the essence and memories of Eggerton, streaming into her through her fist. And she’s utterly ignoring Blat, who is hanging arched backwards, up high at the ceiling, and Darcy standing and watching it all happen.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What are you doing?! Leave him alone!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh!
SEA:
And she opens her fist and Eggerton can move again.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Darcy!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
That was a bad trip.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
It’s been so long. How have you been, Darcy?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I’ve been better.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
We’ll see about that!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No!
SEA:
And she reaches out her hand towards Darcy. And Eggerton, you see Darcy freeze, and she closes her fist and you see black energy soaring through Darcy’s eyes straight into Celene as she cackles—“Ha ha ha!” And the first memory she receives, Darcy, is…?
MARIS:
Running around playing tag with my friends.
A STREET NEAR DARCY’S CHILDHOOD APARTMEN:
MIKE (AS AN OBNOXIOUS KID)
Ha ha ha! You’re it!
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
No, come on! I’m always it. I can’t outrun you.
MIKE (AS AN OBNOXIOUS KID)
That’s why you’re always it! Ha ha ha!
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
Oh, no, not again. Can you just be it for once?
MIKE (AS AN OBNOXIOUS KID)
Okay, whoever has the weirdest spikiest hair is it.
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
But that’s always me!
MIKE (AS AN OBNOXIOUS KID)
Well, I guess it’s you then! Ha ha ha!
The sound of hooves on the pavement.
SEAN (AS A YOUNG CENTAUR)
Hey, guys! Can I play?
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
Uh… aren’t you new here?
SEAN (AS A YOUNG CENTAUR)
Yeah.
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
When did you come to Steadfast?
SEAN (AS A YOUNG CENTAUR)
Oh, we came from the country just a couple weeks ago.
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
Oh!
SEAN (AS A YOUNG CENTAUR)
I saw you guys playing. Uh, my name’s Paul.
MIKE (AS AN OBNOXIOUS KID)
Hi, Paul. Hi, my name’s Marley!
SEAN (AS A PAUL THE CENTAUR)
Are there other centaurs here?
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
Yeah, sometimes! We sometimes have centaurs come here.
SEAN (AS A PAUL THE CENTAUR)
Oh, really?
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS A PAUL THE CENTAUR)
I hadn’t seen any. I just, you know, I felt really awkward.
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
Oh, no, you shouldn’t! I really think it’s cool that you have an extra set of legs.
SEAN (AS A PAUL THE CENTAUR)
Really?
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS A PAUL THE CENTAUR)
Can I play tag then?
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
Well, of course! Although you’re going to run a lot faster than us.
SEAN (AS A PAUL THE CENTAUR)
Oh, okay, well—
MIKE (AS MARLEY THE OBNOXIOUS KID)
It’s okay! So what’s going to happen then is, you two weirdos get to be it together first! And I’m gonna run away. Ha ha ha ha!
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
What? Hey! Stop!
SEAN (AS A PAUL THE CENTAUR)
Okay, I got you this way!
He gallops off.
MARISA (AS YOUNG DARCY)
All right. All right. I’m always it anyway, so I’ll chase you first.
THE ICE CAVER:
SEA:
We return to the cavern, now bathed in the red light through her fiery eyes, as Celene towers over the held-immobile Darcy. And in the moment of her consuming those memories, she forgets about Blat, who is suddenly released, and able to move, along with Eggerton, as they both stare at the energy streaming up from the tiny Darcy into the goddess’s eyes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, leave her alone! You’re a big bully!
SEA:
She pays no attention. She continues to drink the memories of Darcy.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No… Okay, I’m gonna… I’m gonna stop you… now…
Dramatic music starts.
MIK:
And Eggerton turns and charges at the foot of the giant Celene. And jumps on it.
SEA:
Awesome. Celene continues to drink the memories of Darcy and you watch Darcy’s form start to grow limp and start to sag as Eggerton leaps on to the giant Celene’s foot, pounding at it. And Blat watches all of this from high above.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat! Help! Help! Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(sighs)
Oh, Eggerton. Why do you think that would help?
Eggerton. Bend over and count your toes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay! One, two…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Bazooka.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…three, four…
CARTE:
And Blat fires.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…five, six, seven…
SEA:
You don’t even have to roll Volley. She’s not even gonna attempt to—
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
…eight, nine, ten! Should I start over and count down?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I just mean get down!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh! Well, you should say that next time.
SEA:
Roll for damage. Now are you using your plus ability?
MIK:
Yeah, you should read your character sheet, ya jag.
Laughter.
SEA:
You just got a new ability right? When you leveled up?
CARTE:
I don’t know if I should risk it because then I might do damage to myself.
MARIS:
Oh yeah, don’t.
SEA:
You actually don’t have to roll here. She’s not going to attempt to…
CARTE:
Well then, let’s all read this together, shall we children?
SEA:
Yeah, what’s it called?
CARTE:
“Bonded Strike: When you pour your soul into your soul-bound weapon and attack, do damage based on your roll. On a 10+, deal +1d6 damage. On a 7 to 9, deal your damage and your enemy makes an attack on you (+1d6) against your weakened state.
SEA:
So this is a guaranteed hit.
CARTE:
Well, all right. There are very few guarantees in The End of Time and Other Bothers. We may as well take advantage.
SEA:
So roll a six-sided die.
CARTE:
3!
SEA:
So 5?
(laughing)
Wait, let me do the math on Celene’s hit points.
CARTE:
(laughs)
SEA:
Let me subtract a 3 from that. Give me a minute. It’ll take me a little while…
MARIS:
No, he has 5! Because it’s a plus, right?
SEA:
Oh, minus 5, oooh.
MARIS:
From 300? That’s something!
MIK:
Yeah, that is gonna make the difference. Good job!
SEA:
Eggerton, you see a missile coming in from high above and strike Celene right in the back of her giant head. A fireball erupts—she leans forward from the impact and then rocks backward and opens her fist, releasing Darcy as she turns and directs her attention, lifting her foot and shoving it forward…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ooop!
SEA:
Sending you flying back towards the wall, sliding along the ice.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Whoa!
SEA:
As she looks up at Blat flying high above.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, darling! Did you desire my attention?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I officially wish to submit my resignation.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Gladly received. I will devour you! Slowly, of course.
SEA:
She puts both hands forward—and Darcy, your amulet begins to light up.
And you see Blat flying backwards towards the far wall. You can roll to Defy Danger if you try to do something Blat. What are you going to try?
CARTE:
I will try to defy the danger, yes.
SEA:
How?
CARTE:
By simply flying down, away from the beams of energy.
(rolls)
7.
SEA:
Plus your Dex.
CARTE:
Plus Dex is an 8.
SEA:
Partial. So Blat plummets towards the ground, wings unfurled, but the blast tangles him up and he spins and slams into the ice. Roll 1d4.
MARIS:
(sighs)
MIK:
(laughs)
CARTE:
Blat smashes to the ground… and does not get back up.
A thud. The music stops.
MIKE AND MARISA (AS EGGERTON AND DARCY)
Blat!
SEA:
Blat. What is the memory that flashes into your brain as you see the ground rising rapidly to meet you?
CARTE:
That one file that Blat could never find.
BLAT’S FILING ROO:
The Speechifyer rings. Blat answers
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(in his old voice)
Hi-diddly-ho, go for Blat!
SEAN (AS BLAT’S BOSS)
Uh, yeah. Blat? You know, I’m a little confused. I know we’ve requested this file from you. And for some reason I can’t seem to find it on my desk.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh no, sir! I pneumatic-tubed a series of files to you just yesterday. I’m sure you’ll find them within the pile as you always do! This is, let me see, file D47-AF. I’m sure you’ll find it there.
SEAN (AS BLAT’S BOSS)
Yeah, I have I have D47-AE… D47-AB… D47-AG… I have D‑9000—that was personal, you can forgot about that one.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Already forgotten!
SEAN (AS BLAT’S BOSS)
Thank you. But I do not see D47-AF. I just opened the canister. Again, I know you’ve never not sent the file before…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Perfect record, sir, as you know!
SEAN (AS BLAT’S BOSS)
Um… I don’t see it here. You know what, I’m going to send this right back. Just without D‑9000. I’m just gonna send this right back right now. Here it comes.
Blat hangs up as a canister shoots out of a pneumatic tube with a thunk.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(to himself)
All right. I don’t know why this is so complicated. You simply unscrew the top—pull out the rolled up files—and we can simply see… that the file that he cannot find is indeed not here—oh my lord my life is a lie.
The Speechifyer rings again.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shaken)
Hi-diddly ho, go for Blat.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT)
Uh, yes, Blat. So sorry to bother you. You sent some files to our office yesterday. I’m sorry, this is the Office of the Registry for the Registry of the Registry.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Let me guess. I didn’t send any of the correct files.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT)
Actually, you you sent three of the correct files. There’s just a file that’s not here. Um, I’m looking for D47-AF?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uh… Yes! I attempted to said that file to my boss. Was that supposed to go to you?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT)
Yes. So… fine. Don’t send it to him and just send it to us.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right. So I’ll just… find it…
SEAN (AS ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT)
Is there a problem?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Just a crazy question. If for some reason I “can’t find” file D47-AF, what exactly would happen?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT)
I’m sorry. I have reached Filing and Records?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes! This is Filing and Records. This is Blat, I’ve been here for nine years.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT)
And you’re… you’re suggesting that Filing and Records cannot find an official file?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh… just a question off the top of my head, just in case something that would never happen should actually happen. I was just wondering how bad it would get.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT)
Right. So are you asking about let’s say, a personnel file? Or are you asking about the very secret eyes-only file D47-AF?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh, it’s that important, is it?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER BUREAUCRAT)
Yes… just to clarify now—you’re not speaking about what would happen if you lost a file that the Emperor himself was requesting.
Smashing noises.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! My Speechifyer has hit the ground! Oh! I’ve stepped on it a couple of times. Oh, clumsy me! Okay, we’ll have to get back to you. This is Blat from Records, okay, bye-bye.
Ohhhhhh, what have I done? All right. We could try reconstructing it Reconstructing it! So that’s easy, you just get an empty file here, and then you write down D… 4… 7—
A knock at the door.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! Oh lord. Ohhh lord. Uh, all right. All right. D47-AF has been created. The only problem is that there’s nothing in it.
More knocking
MARISA (AS JANINE)
Blat? Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes!
MARISA (AS JANINE)
It’s Janine and Toby!
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Hey Blat!
MARISA (AS JANINE)
And guess what day it is?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Uhhhhh…
The door opens and Janine and Toby parade in.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
It is Happy Perfect File Delivery Day! We baked you a cake!
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Woop! Woop!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, I was hoping it was my retirement.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
No! We’re just gonna sing you the song! Happy Perfect File Delivery Day!
MIKE (AS TOBY)
(trying to sing along and failing)
Happy Birth—Filing—Delivery Day!
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Toby seems off key.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
Toby’s always off key.
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Something happened to me when I was a baby.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Hey guys! Sorry I’m late! Did I miss it? Did you sing the song already?
MARISA (AS JANINE)
We already sang the song, you missed it.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Awww. You’re such a legend, Blat! No one has had this long of a run without being murdered and hung up to die!
(laughs)
MIKE (AS TOBY)
We all look up to you!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Wait! Is that what happened to the last guy?!
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
(laughing)
Oh yea. That was so long ago. I’m sure they don’t do that any more, do they Janine?
MARISA (AS JANINE)
He mean to say “fired”. He meant to say “fired”.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Ha ha! Yeah! They don’t do that anymore, I’m sure.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
So, perfect record! You’ve never lost a file. That’s incredible, Blat!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Well… here’s the thing. I was talking to a friend of mine who worked at another ministry that is in no way this one… and they almost were perfect. They lost one file—
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Yeah, because they don’t have you, right?
Hearty laughter.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Anyhoo. So they lost a file that was marked Top Secret. And what do you think would happen to them?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Ooooo. Wait, wait, wait. How secret?
(laughs nervously)
Like, not Emperor-secret?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Maaaybe Emperor-secret?
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Now, when you say “they”, do you mean like, before they got summarily executed in front of a live audience or after?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, is that what they do now?
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Well, I mean, that’s like Wednesday afternoons.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Ha ha, right.
MIKE (AS TOBY)
They just gather all the people up who lost the important information for the Emperor. And it’s gonna go like one—bang, two—bang…
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
But if it’s a weekend..
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Oh, weekend, no, yeah.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Oh, if it’s a weekend, whoof. They make that a spectacle.
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Yeah, that’s—I mean, have you ever seen someone explode underwater?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Janine, weren’t you like a cousin of a cousin removed from someone that just misplaced like, a toenail clipping of the Emperor?
MARISA (AS JANINE)
Yes, well, that is true. And they did go up in spectacular fashion. I did attend—I felt that was the honourable and proper thing to do.
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Of course, of course.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
The explosion was… epic, really.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Aww.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
But what were you asking about, Blat?
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Yeah.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
We should be eating cake!
MIKE (AS TOBY)
C’mon, eat some cake with us!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Yes! Let’s eat cake with a large smile on our face.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Look we—it looks like a file!
Laughter.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
Yes! I did that!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ha ha, yes, it does look like a file.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
We didn’t know what number to put on it so we just made one up, ha ha.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, really, what number do we have here?
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Uh, D47-AF!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ahhh. AF indeed.
SEA:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Ohhhh lordy. So! Uh, look. I’ve cut a large piece and—
(stuffs his face noisily)
I have eaten it…
MIKE (AS TOBY)
I didn’t know your jaw could open that wide.
The damaged Speechifyer begins ringing weakly.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Is that your Speechifyer? Shouldn’t you answer it?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh! The Speechifyer. Okay, well, you kids have fun—uh, see you in Human Resources.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Where are you going?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Oh, just gotta answer the old Speechifyer!
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
But you’re leaving the room.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right! Well, what I do now is, I put on my coat and my hat, I check the furnace, and then I always answer the Speechifyer.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
Oh, okay…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
So, uh… see you crazy kids later! And Toby, please accept my apologies, you have a lovely singing voice. Okay, see you kids in a few.
The door slams.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
God, I hope someday I’m as good as Blat.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
That’ll never happen.
MIKE (AS TOBY)
He’s so sexy.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
No one can be as good as Blat.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
I know.
MIKE (AS TOBY)
I mean, he just must pull all the time.
SEAN (AS ANOTHER CO-WORKER)
(sighs)
I don’t know how he does it. He’s like, impeccable.
MARISA (AS JANINE)
Is anyone gonna answer that Speechifyer?
MIKE (AS TOBY)
Naaah, we should probably just let it go.
THE ICE CAVER:
The music resumes.
SEA:
Celene freezes, eyes glowing with such anger and redness. Waiting for Blat’s form to stand back up.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Okay, Blat. A joke’s a joke. Let’s go.
BLAT! I SAID WAKE UP!
SEA:
And the head pivots to target Darcy and Eggerton.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Get—him—up.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
What have you done to him?!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Blat?
SEAN (AS CELENE)
It’s nothing compared to what I’m gonna do to him!
MARIS:
I run across the room and I skid on my knees beside Blat…
SEA:
…your medallion glowing even brighter…
MARIS:
And I touch him to feel if there’s any warmth, or I listen for his breath.
SEA:
His form is strangely crumpled. But you get a sense that something inside of him is refusing to let him die. Perhaps a dark, evil source that starts with the word M.
MARIS:
So I take my amulet and I press it against his skin and I cast Devoted Healer. Cure Light Wounds with Devoted Healer.
SEA:
What does that do?
MARIS:
“When you heal someone else of damage, add your level to the amount of damage healed.”
SEA:
Okay, so roll 1d8.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
Plus your levels.
MARIS:
Okay, that’s a 5, so 9. He gets 9 hit points—well…
SEA:
Carter, you’re actually at 1, believe it or not. Morrigu is refusing to let you die. So you’re at 10 now.
Celine is slowly bending down, her head getting closer and closer.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Well, Darcy? I don’t see him standing up…
I need that vessel!
MIK:
And from behind, Eggerton, in a rage, flaps his wings at the bent-over butt of the goddess.
This is Gust of Wind.
SEA:
(laughs)
Would you like to read Gust of Wind for us?
MIK:
“Gust of Wind: When you create a powerful gust of wind with your wings, that creates a 20-foot cone that knocks down human-sized or smaller creatures not braced or protected. Take +Shaky until you get to rest next.”
SEA:
Right. So, just a quick question… Would you say that Celene is currently human-size or lesser?
MIK:
Are you really trying to apply logic to this situation?
MARIS:
I think it would tickle her at the very least.
MIK:
It would maybe distract her. I mean, the idea is to push her but…
SEA:
Okay, I’ll give it to you.
Okay, so suddenly Celene—her eyes go wide, she flails her arms and lands on her knees with her hands right over you, the ground resounding as it shakes, and you now are directly beneath her giant bosom.
MIK:
(snickers)
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(gasps dramatically)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Blat! You’re alive!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Mother?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
No!
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
And Celene reaches down a giant hand to grab Blat.
MARIS:
And I just revolve around to face upwards towards Celene. And I’m absolutely enraged, thus I gain 2 Rage because she’s almost killed Blat—and I transform.
MIK:
Woop!
SEA:
Into?
MARIS:
Into… I have to roll a d12 to know. Just so everyone knows, I only transform into my primary form if I roll a 1 to 6. I then have other forms I transform into.
MIK:
What? I didn’t know that.
MARIS:
Yep. That’s why I was a bear once. It’s an 11! So that’s a player and/or GM choice.
SEA:
What do you want to be?
MARIS:
(whispers)
Oh no. I have to think!
SEA:
You are a giant, pissed-off…
MARIS:
Kangaroo!
MIK:
Ooo!
MARIS:
(whooshing noise)
MIK:
(laughs)
MARIS:
And suddenly this big foot comes up to right under Celene’s chin, and the kangaroo hits her right under with her big foot.
SEA:
Okay, so let’s do that as an attack roll.
MARIS:
Okay.
SEA:
So you’re gonna roll to Hack and Slash, so it’s 2d6.
MARIS:
(hums)
2d6…
SEA:
Do you have a +Strength or +Dex in your your current form?
MARIS:
I have plus—oh, in my current…? Now wait a minute, I do gain 2 Armor, let’s remember that.
SEA:
Your attack die changes.
MARIS:
“Player and GM”—okay, we have to choose the damage die for our kangaroo.
SEA:
Well, kangaroos are nasty. d12. Sure.
MARIS:
Ha!
MIK:
Sure. I can get behind that.
SEA:
Okay, so a couple things here to keep in mind. “When you become frustrated, angry or take damage, gain 1 Rage.” So if you take any damage. “When you roll a miss, your actions harm or endanger an ally and you gain 2 Rage. When you make a 10+—this is the key one—successful attack, you overwhelm your enemy with a flurry of attacks. They take +Disoriented, +Frightened or other appropriate tag.”
MARIS:
Mm hmm.
SEA:
Okay, and you have some things where you are Unkillable Beast. Okay: “Whenever you gain Rage, heal 2 hit points of damage per point of Rage that you take.” So you just took 2, so you get 4 hit points.
MARIS:
Which is nice.
SEA:
So you gain 4 hit points right away. Not over your max, but up to your max.
MARIS:
Yup. Yup. Okay, I’m at 15. But what you were asking is, do I get different dice? And I don’t think I do.
SEA:
No. So 2d6, roll to hit, +Strength or Dex, whichever you want.
MARIS:
Yeah, I have… hmm, Dex.
SEA:
Well, I think it’d be Strength. So no plus.
MARIS:
No plus.
(rolls)
It’s a 7, so that’s a…
SEA:
Mixed success. Okay, so you catch her under her chin. Roll damage.
MARIS:
Which is a d12… That’s an 11.
SEA:
Whoa.
MIK:
Mm hmm!
MARIS:
That is one kangaroo kick.
SEA:
So this kangaroo connects—her whole body arching up from the ground at the slumped-over Celene, catches Celene right in the chin, snapping her head back with an audible snap, as Celene, in reaction, swipes her giant hand across the ground, sending Darcy in her current form spiralling towards a wall where she impacts and takes 1d4 damage. Roll 1d4?
MARIS:
That’s 1 but I have Armor, so nothing.
SEA:
Nothing. And she snarls and reaches back to grab Blat.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Mother is angry…
MIK:
(laughs)
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, you have no idea how much.
SEA:
And she grabs Blat in a crushing grip—
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Grk!
SEA:
And lifts him up as she sits back on her haunches.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You know what? Maybe I’ll just devour you, vessel, Morrigu and all.
SEA:
And she begins to open her mouth—and it opens frighteningly wide, the bones snapping in her face as it continues to widen and widen until all you can see, Blat, is a gaping mouth.
And she goes to thrust you in… when Darcy, your amulet explodes in light across the cavern. Blat, the symbol on your chest burns as if someone is pressing a torch against your skin… and you feel it suddenly release Morrigu from deep inside you who emerges with a scream, a deep dark, horrible scream.
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
(a deep, distorted roar)
Rrraaaah! Finally!
MIDROL:
Music sting.
ANNOUNCE:
It’s the beginning of the middle of The End of Time and Other Bothers.
SEA:
Hey everyone, Sean here. And I want to thank you all so much for listening and sharing and reviews and everything you’ve all been doing to spread the word.
We are going to be forgoing the thanks to sponsors because I’ve been travelling and I haven’t been able to pull that data together. So that is coming very soon in our next episode. But in the meantime, I want to give a shout out to a couple places where you can come and say hi to me, and to Eli in some cases.
So we are going to be at PodTales on October 20 in Boston. PodTales is super amazing, it’s gonna be super fun. It’s one day, October 20. Also, I’m going to be speaking at Podcast Movement, that’s August 14, 15 and 16 in Orlando, Florida. I’m speaking Wednesday AM at 9 AM and I’m talking about Patreon. If you’re going to be at either of those two events, please stop and say hi.
And I want to give a shout out to a show that I have been loving so much so if you haven’t heard of it, go and subscribe to it now and give it a listen. If you like sci-fi you’re going to love it. It is ARCA-45672. It’s really cool—it is basically about exploring an alien world, and it’s really well done, and I recommend it highly. And that’s it! Let’s get you back to the show.
Music sting.
MIK:
Okay, okay okay—here, I’ll record a midroll for us. Go to OtherBothers.com. Follow the links to iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, wherever you listen, rate and review my travel mug.
MARIS:
No!
MIK:
Yeah, that’s what we want, right?
SEA:
No! We don’t want reviews of your travel mug—
MIK:
Okay, we want to rate and review…
SEA:
Okay, but if you’re going to review his travel mug, mention the pen.
MIK:
No, okay, you know what? The pen can’t even write on my travel mug. The travel mug wins in a fight.
SEA:
Yes, it can, watch. No, no you’re right, it doesn’t write on the plastic.
MIK:
Yeah.
Silence.
CARTE:
But why do we care about that?!
MIK:
OtherBothers.com!
MARIS:
Brought to you by low blood sugar.
MIK:
(snickers)
THE ICE CAVER:
A fierce wind whistles.
SEA:
We return to the chamber deep beneath the ice. Celene rises forward with a horrific rage-filled scream, to be matched and met with a dark force of Morrigu, clashing in the centre, as Blat is dropped, unthought-of, from Celene’s grasp. And Darcy and Eggerton watch from the floor far below.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Oh geez.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(finally back to his normal voice)
Ohhhh! My throat feels so much better!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
Blat?!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No time for congratulations yet, friend. Because we’re going to be killed by not one but two goddesses!
Giant, thundering blasts of energy.
SEA:
It is the sound of worlds being torn apart far above you as two goddesses collide with elemental force, sending you all careening back against the walls of this giant chamber.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ooooog…
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouts)
Well, you ladies look like you’ve got a whole lot going on… so we can just get out of your hair for now! We’ll show ourselves out!
MARIS:
And I hop back over to where I originally transformed, near where Blat’s body was. And I take my paws and I thump them down on the book that dropped to the ground, looking towards Eggerton. Thump thump thump!
(she drums on the table)
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(gasps)
She’s saying that she wants to communicate with us. Hold on… Okay, now go.
MARIS:
And I keep thumping at the book, looking at Eggerton—holding up my paws, thumping on the book, looking at Eggerton.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She needs a bathroom break, and then wants to talk to you about that book.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I’ve just taken a bathroom break right now!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, well, now you can go check out the book then. I think that’s what she’s—she’s either saying “come look at this book,” or “do I look better with a hook?”
MARIS:
So then I start kicking the book with my feet towards the door, towards the exit that Blat is backing towards. As I scooch across the floor with the book.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shouting)
I’m surprised the kangaroo didn’t use her claws to pick up the book, which she’s quite capable of doing, and putting it in the convenient pouch on the front of her!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouting)
Do kangaroos have claws? I thought they had people-like hands!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, they don’t have opposable thumbs, but they’re kind of claw-like.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Can you pick up a book if you don’t have opposable thumbs?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Well, you can pick up a baby kangaroo, so I think you could probably find a way to pick up a book.
SEA:
Celene, in the middle of her battle, with a roar, turns her head slightly and gestures. Ice rolls down, covering every exit.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
You will not leave, vessel! I am going to put Morrigu back in you—forever!
SEA:
And the battle continues far overhead.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(shouting)
All right! I’ve got 30 People’s Credits on me, on Morrigu. Are you interested in betting on the other side?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(shouting)
I only have two credits. But I do have this new mixing bowl helmet that I’d say is probably worth a good 35 credits. So how about I say… Celene takes it but with damage.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Right. Sure. Okay…
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Right? And then you’re just saying Morrigu outright.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Morrigu outright, yes.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
So we’re doing like—we’re not doing over-under.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
No, this is a TKO.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Decisive victory.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, I’m—yeah, I’m Team Celene on this one.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fair enough!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay, shake on it?
CARTER (AS BLAT)
(still shouting)
I’m a little far from you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Okay!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I feel like maybe we’ve been speaking too long, and we should see about were-kangaroo.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You know what? Why don’t you pick up that book that she just kicked towards you, and write down the bet just in case someone—not looking at you—decides to change their mind if the battle starts to go in a different direction.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fair enough. I don’t remember you getting the new helmet. It’s quite becoming!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Thank you! I’m so happy you’re back!
SEA:
Darcy the kangaroo has a very sad expression on her face…
MIK:
(laughs)
SEA:
While a battle to end everything takes place above them.
The crashing stops abruptly.
SEA:
And suddenly everything freezes in the room, as if time has halted. And Darcy, you sense that you are not alone. In fact, you hear a voice and it says…
MIKE (AS A PIRATE)
(booming and godlike)
Yarrr! This is gettin’ some attention upstairs!
What’s a wee lass like you doing in the middle of a goddess battle?
Silence.
MIKE (AS A PIRATE)
Really? Nothing?
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
(Scottish accent)
No, you see! She canna talk. She’s a wee kangaroo!
MIKE (AS A PIRATE)
No, there’s more to this one, I say. Or my name’s not Captain Blackheart!
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
I know your name is Captain—why are you telling me your name?! I know you’re Captain Blackheart!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART THE PIRATE)
Look, all us gods have to have a schtick and that’s mine.
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
I don’t understand—you’re the god of pirates!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
More specifically, the god of beards, gold bullion, and being stranded on a desert island—which is sometimes associated with pirates, but not always.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Gentlemen. I don’t know if this is the appropriate time for this argument.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
That’s what you always say! You never want to have a discussion and find resolution. And I’ve had it up here with ya.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
And you never once bring pastries to our meetings as you say you will.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
That’s not my job. My job is to make sure that other pirates just don’t become gods.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
We all take turns bringing pastries except you.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Well, if you can figure out how to knead dough with a hook for a hand, I’d love to hear it.
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
You buy them! You just go somewhere where they can be purchased. Or you politely ask the god of pastries and dessert items to make something for you!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
But she’s never around when I need her.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Thank you.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh, super! You’re all here, excellent. Look what I brought from the goddess of pastries and tarts.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Brenda!
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh, you know, I’m never gonna disappoint you, now!
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
And they call you a lesser god. It’s not fair.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Oh, they do that? I…
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
I would stand up for you if someone called you a lesser god in front of me.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Well, I appreciate that, Cap’n.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Mm hmm.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Mm hmm.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I didn’t mean to—
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
You see, it’s not that difficult, is it? Just a little bit o’ thinking about other people.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
I think about other people all the time and where they’ve hidden their treasure.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Now, perhaps we should bring our attention to Celene and her… clear plan, that I’ve laid out for you all, to usurp us all by eating Morrigu the Ancient One.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
She should have a croissant instead.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I don’t believe she would agree with that. I do believe, Captain Blackheart, that she wants more than all the pastries in the world. I believe she’s trying to become the only goddess.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Again, I thought we went through this before with that orange god and we just kicked ’em out.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
We did. This is perhaps a time for us to listen to the little ones who have fought so hard against her as mortals.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Which little ones? This kangaroo?
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Well, she’s currently a kangaroo, yes. I will give—
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
(of the party)
Frozen—frozen—kangaroo. You’ve frozen the only ones that are capable to speak.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I will grant her the ability to speak. Listen.
A shimmer of magic.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(breathless)
What—who? Who are you?!
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
You see, this is the problem—they’re all like, oh, I’m talking to gods! And they got all upset and quivery-like.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
You’re gods?!
(gasps)
Loxsyn!
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Darcy… Yes.
We have come because you have brought to our attention what Celene is attempting to do. The gods need to hear it. They won’t believe it if just I, mere Loxsyn, a minor god, tell them.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(gasps)
You think Loxsyn is a minor god?
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
Well, on the list, sort of at the top end of the minors—so like, the top of the minors or like the bottom of the majors.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
And if you think you’re so major, who are you?
CARTER (AS ANOTHER GODLY VOICE)
Why, I’m Dialogus! I’m the god of improvisation and questionable accents.
MIK:
(snickers)
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, well, that doesn’t sound very major to me. I mean, Loxsyn has helped me countless times.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
(his accent has by now drifted to Irish)
Oh no, I never said that. I was major. You see, I’m actually what you would call a triple‑A god, really down on the list. But happy to attend the meetings!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
It’s really important that we get up and, you know, take a few swings now and then. Even if we’re not in the show, it’s important to stretch it out and make sure we’re staying in shape.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Both of you, with your names, come before me on the roster call, right?
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Well that’s kind of a given, yeah.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Yeah.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
C… D… L.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Yes.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
I feel like this whole thing is really making me question spirituality in general, but I will say that Celene has really overstepped her bounds and almost killed my friend Blat and I think wants to take over the universe, the world, everything. I mean she’s trying to battle that other god!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Did you say “Blat”?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Yes!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
What kind of a silly name is that?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, it’s a demon name.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Ohhh, demons.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Short for Blathoxil.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Oh! I knew a Blathoxil once. Washed up on shore on a beach and complained about his companions for hours.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Well, he did give me the place of power, so if we can ever approve that motion in circle, I believe I would be moving up to the next tier—
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Ohhh, that’s what this is about! Another place of power for Loxsyn!
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
You see, I only have places of power in pretentious little theatres that no one goes to, where they all wear black and people think, “Am I gonna see a real show?” No! They’re just making it up once again.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
I—
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
And stick to an accent! It just comes and goes.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
By the way, if I bring three friends, do I get to go up next time?
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
You do! And that shouldn’t count! Real theatre, you should just pay a fee and watch professionals.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Okay, but—
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I really enjoyed that last amateur night you did. I had a great—the pastries were amazing.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
But you use the A‑word, and that just sticks in my craw.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Oh yes, sorry.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Excuse me! Excuse me, I thought we were focusing on this Celene-Morrigu battle.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Oh, well—you know, there is a small problem. Darcy, I know you see me as a very generous and you know, all-encompassing goddess but—
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Yeah, but you haven’t seen her when the dinner bell comes! All of a sudden Loxsyn is—
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
(clears her throat)
I believe we were talking about Celene, Captain Blackheart.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Oh yes.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
So the small problem is that Celene is quite powerful as, you know, the moon and well, Morrigu is an Ancient One, sort of undefeatable. And… I summoned all the gods and these three are, well… this is what we have to work with.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Well, that’s got to be more than what I have. I’m a kangaroo!
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
It is a good point. Yes, well…
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
A mortal that can turn into a kangaroo, though, is pretty impressive.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Well, you know, this mortal kangaroo, and this somewhat mortal fae, and this demon with a horrible name of Blat are attempting to stand up against Celene herself.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
That’s pretty stupid. I mean, why would a mortal go, hey, here’s a major goddess. She controls the moon. I use the moon to get around. Like just to put it in context as a minor god, I need the moon. And these three little squishy ones, especially that very handsome, charming one—
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Yes, he’s quite handsome.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
—are like, we’re gonna take on a goddess? I feel like they kind of brought this on themselves.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
He makes very good pastries.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Now that’s a super good point.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Ah, Brenda, yes.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
But I have to bring up that this demon over here, he has come to my place twice. And he was actually able to withstand the might of Morrigu!
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Really!
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Yes! You’d think anyone else, it would have torn them apart. But he turned up, tried to eat me and destroy me. I mean, that took some, you know, cojones, and it was quite impressive. So I think there might be something to them.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
So your defence of him. just—I appreciate it—but it’s basically that he came to eat you.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Well, yes, but that he was able to withstand the power of Morrigu!
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Hmm, okay.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
Demons, though.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Yeah, they show up from time to time and I’m never a fan.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
They don’t worship any of us.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
They don’t worship…? What—what are we even doing? Where’s my agent? I was told that this was a worship-paying event and that’s why I’m here and you’re telling me—I came all the way here from the sea and they’re not even gonna worship us?!
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Let’s keep this civil. Let’s not bring the agents in.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
So is there anything you can do to help us?
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Well… we could probably do something if we wanted too, but…
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
Well, do we have anything to lock up both Celene and Morrigu?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Oh, that sounds good, locking up. That’s excellent.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Well, we could have used Celene’s crystal but the demon one destroyed it.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
Now why in the world would you do something like that?!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
It seems as though someone put him in a position where he thought that was the best idea possible, despite the fact that that would not eventually assist in anything.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I thought maybe we could nominate one of us to speak to Celene. Or Morrigu.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
You… want to try and talk it out with two warring goddesses.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
Might as well just try hugging it out then.
MIK:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
Ooo, touchy-feely crappity-do.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
That’s enough of that.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
It seems, Darcy, that we we’re short of ideas for for how to assist.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
But Loxsyn, I’ve always relied on you for the answers. I don’t understand this at all. You should be powerful enough to confront Celene and—and fix all this!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Yeah, Loxsyn! Why don’t you confront Celene? Why’d you bring us here?
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I’m not really the goddess of answers. I I’m the goddess of pleasure and, and baked goods and…
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(softly)
But you’re the goddess of my answers.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Oh. Well.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
GUILT. GUILT.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Shame!
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
GUILT.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
For shame!
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
It’s not really a fair card to play, Darcy, but I understand you’re desperate.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
A little bit, yes. My friends are still frozen.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Well, perhaps we could just, you know… we could let the goddesses battle it out and maybe in the end rule us all and make us lesser gods in the middle of nowhere—
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You’re talking about double‑A? I’m not going back there!
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
Ohhh, that’s terrible. No, I canna do that. Double‑A! The crowds are terrible.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
They expect you to bring your own beverages!
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
(groans)
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Well, actually, I’m afraid you’d have to try out for double‑A.
MIKE AND CARTER (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART AND DIALOGUS)
WHAT?!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Okay, bring about the cannons! Port, rear, aft firing lines!
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
Do you not know who I am?! Pretentious, dark-clothing-wearing students from all over the world worship the likes of me. True, after a few years they grow out of it when they realize that studying me isn’t going to get them steady work. But still, for a couple of years. I’m important.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Yes. I hear that. I hear Celene… doesn’t believe in theatre.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
WHAT! Okay.
I can’t even. I can’t even right now. With you. Or him. Or the kangaroo.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I know. And I hear Morrigu doesn’t care for stew.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
(gasps)
That is a low blow. I just don’t believe that.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I believe she was there, and chose to try and eat you instead.
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Well, now, that is true, but you know Morrigu, she is very changeable. I’ve never liked her. Never liked her.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
So perhaps we should come up with some scheme to stop these two warring goddesses before we end up in the minor leagues?
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
(gasps)
Okay, here’s a plan. Here’s a plan.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Ah, yes, Captain Blackheart.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
We give them… a treasure map. We put an X on it.
MARIS:
(laughs)
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
But we don’t give them any indication what the X is for, why they have a treasure map, or where they’re going. And we just see what happens.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
And we put them on a boat.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Yes. A boat in an ocean that’s never been described!
Silence.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
I don’t think it’ll work.
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
No, that’s just cruel. Just cruel.
MARIS:
(laughs)
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
That’s what you come up with every time!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
We’ve all got our “things”, Mr. Yes And.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
They love attention! What if we put them on the stage?
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
Yes! I was just about to say. You’re the god of theatre. Why can’t you create the greatest theatre of all where they think they’re still locked in battle, but they’re not really—we send them to a different plane!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
Yes! And we can use the ghost of all the dead sailors I’ve collected as the audience.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
This is interesting, this is interesting.
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
Give them the attention Celene craves.
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
All right, so what we do is… we alter it slightly make it sort of a sporting event and that one night only, Celene versus Morrigu…
MARISA (AS BRENDA)
On the moon!
MIKE (AS CAPTAIN BLACKHEART)
(gasps)
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
On the moon.
All right, just a moment. I’ll just alter my accent slightly.
(clears his throat)
Thunder booms. A grinding guitar theme tune starts up. Rowdy sailors shout in the background
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
(bellowing American wrestling announcer)
Ladies aaaaand gentlemen! In this corner, weighing an incredible amount, it’s Celene, Goddess of the Moon!
SEAN (AS LOXSYN)
(gasps)
What?
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
And in this corner, the Queen of Darkness herself—you hate to love her, you love to hate her—Morrigu!
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
(sinister laugh)
It is I!
MIKE (AS A DEAD PIRATE)
Morrigu! Morrigu!
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
This fight is scheduled for an infinite number of rounds!
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
You will be mine, Celene!
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
First to fall gets to own the dark side of the Moon!
SEAN (AS CELENE)
The moon is mine! Ha ha ha!
CARTER (AS DIALOGUS)
All right, ladies! I want an unfair fight. If you feel like punching each other under the belt, I say you can do it. Punching in the face also allowed—also, we enjoy a nice amount of trash talk. The audience loves it.
A bell rings.
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh isn’t this going to be lovely?
(laughs)
Take that! And this!
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
I will suck the life from your very marrow!
(growls)
SEAN (AS CELENE)
Oh, weren’t you looking behind you, Morrigu?
(laughs)
SEAN (AS MORRIGU)
Take this!
Great clashing blows and hearty cheers from the crowd, fading slowly away.
THE ICE CAVER:
SEA:
We return to the giant cavern, where time resumes—but suddenly the goddesses are gone. The echoes of a battle and a crowd of drunken dead sailors laughing slowly fading as darkness falls on the cavern… except for a slight illumination coming from the kangaroo’s necklace.
MARIS:
And I hop over to Blat and Eggerton and I tap them both gently with my tail.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Aaa!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Aaa! Who the—?
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
(whispers)
Darcy, is that you?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(ostensible kangaroo chatter)
Rr rr!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She says it is.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
I think I could have figured that out. Thank you.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
You are welcome.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Now my question is… where are the two goddesses that were fighting each other just a moment ago?
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rr rr mm rr mm!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Darcy says that she thinks I won the bet.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Mm mm mmm.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
She says yes, definitely.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
(contradicting him)
Mm mm!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Yup, she will not shut up about me definitely winning the bet, and you owing me some credits.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
Fine. Here you are.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Ooo. Thank you.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
30 credits.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Excellent.
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You’ll find that these aren’t legal tender for another several centuries. But here you go.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Perfect. Thank you. She also says the goddesses were tricked by a series of other gods to go to the moon and battle it out for infinity.
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Rrr!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
You won the bet. You don’t need to keep making up stuff.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
No, that’s what she said! She said that! And look! Look, she found a treasure map!
Silence.
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
I don’t know what that has to do with anything, but she’s got it!
CARTER (AS BLAT)
My question is… now that this is all over, could we please for the love of Pete simply go back to the Academy of the Fallen and start working on solving the end of time?!
MARISA (AS DARCY)
Uh-oh!
MIKE (AS EGGERTON)
Funny story!
SEA:
SCENE!
MARIS:
(exhausted)
Oh my God!
Laughter.

Okay… I’m gonna stop you… now!
MIK:
And Eggerton, like, slaps…
No, I…
I dunno!
Laughter.
MIK:
My brain stopped working! I think I’m having a stroke!
The entire table in fits of scatterbrained laughter.
SEA:
Eggerton or Michael?
MIK:
(gasping for breath)
Both.
