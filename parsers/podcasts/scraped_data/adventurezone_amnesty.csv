[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: Okay, hi everybody! Welcome back to—
Travis: We’re back in the saddle again!
Clint: Yaaaay!
Justin: What?
Griffin: —The Adventure Zone. That was rough, uh, for me, so I can’t imagine how it was for you…
Travis: [guitar noises] We’re back in the saddle a-ga-a-ain.
Griffin: Justin, do you have anything you wanna sort of say to—
Justin: I was just kinda trying to let you do your thing.
Griffin: Aw damn dude, that’s really solid of you. [Travis laughs] Um, this is the setup episode for the new mini-arc that we’re doing, the next mini-arc that I’m gonna be running, that I’m very excited about, and, um, I’m just so stoked to get started because we’re playing a game called Monster of the Week. Um, which was— I guess we should talk about what we’re doing in this episode, we’re really just gonna be talking a little bit about the game — what sort of the inspirations for the setting and these few episodes that I have prepared are, you guys are gonna talk about your characters, and that’s pretty much gonna be it. Um, but you all have read the, the full manual, the full revised edition manual of Monster of the Week by Michael Sands, right? You all did your homework?
Justin: Yes.
Travis: I have.
Griffin: Okay, good. Um—
Travis: I actually made myself a 10-page shortened-down version of everything I needed to know. A quick reference guide, if you will.
Griffin: There actually is a reference guide that—
Justin: There is a printable reference guide.
Griffin: There is a printable reference guide, but that’s—
Travis: God dammit.
Griffin: —very cool that— no, it’s good that you did the, you know—
Travis: No, don’t.
Griffin: You showed your work.
Travis: Don’t patronize me.
Clint: Look, I got the actual book.
Justin: In fact— wait, I left my printable reference guide on the printer, so you guys just talk amongst yourselves.
Griffin & Clint: Okay.
Griffin: Well, we’re not actually gonna be playing any of this episode, that’ll be for next week’s episode, because by the way, we are going weekly for the rest of the experimental arcs [Clint: Woohoo!] starting this week. So, um, I guess actually we have an episode—
Clint: I hope we don’t screw it up!
Griffin: Yeah, no, me too. I don’t know why you would even say that. Um, so, let’s get started! Monster of the Week is a game sort of modeled after, appropriately enough, like, monster-of-the-week shows like, uh, Buffy and Supernatural. In which, in each sort of arc, there is a monster that a team of hunters has to hunt down.
It is a game that is part of the Powered by the Apocalypse system which, if you listen to the Balance arc, is sort of what I based the Stolen Century episodes on. It is a very— it’s sort of like the d20 system, right? That covers a lot of different games, like D&D and Pathfinder. Uh, it is sort of just like a broad rule set that you can put a bunch of different stuff on top of to make it fit whatever genre you want it to fit. And there’s a ton of very cool games that use the Powered by the Apocalypse system. Uh, I was inspired to do an Apocalypse game because of one of my favorite podcasts, Friends at the Table, which has done a bunch of really cool ones in sci-fi worlds and fantasy worlds and all kinds of stuff.
But Monster of the Week is sort of this, this monster-of-the-week sort of horror but like, campy horror? Uh, thing that’s going on here? And the basic rule that covers pretty much everything in Monster of the Week and all the Apocalypse games, is that whenever something comes up that is not, like, an automatic thing, like is something that is dangerous or a conflict, or something that would be covered by like a D&D move, like, oh, you have to roll a perception check if you wanna actually notice that thing, all that stuff is in here, but instead of rolling a 20-sided dice, you roll two six-sided dice, and then one of three things happens.
Either you roll a six or below, and you have fucked up. You have fucked up now. And something goes horribly wrong sort of at my discretion. I’ll be GMing this game, they actually call the GM in this game The Keeper which is, like, so great to me? That the fiction of the game extends out of the game, like, Stranger Things style.
So, six or below is a miss. A seven to nine is a mixed success, where you get to do the thing you wanna do, but usually there is a cost. And then a 10 plus is “You crushed it,” and you get to do what you wanna do, and usually it’s just all great.
Justin: One cool thing to note about getting a bad roll is if you get one of those six or below, you get an experience point! And then you get to level up.
Griffin: That’s true.
Justin: That’s neat.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: We learn from our failures.
Justin: Thank you, Travis, yes.
Griffin: It’s beautiful! This is a game of small numbers, for the most part. Which is— it’s something that I think is gonna be really, really great for us, because we would get lost in the weeds with a lot of the math of D&D. Things like, you know, adding up 6d10 for— or 10d6 for a big fireball or something like that. That’s not really true here, the margins are much smaller. If like, if you land an attack, you know how much damage it does, and it’s usually like two or three. And that’s about as high as it ever gets.
Travis: Yeah, I do like that the bonuses, like the things that you add to rolls. I think the highest it goes is plus three?
Griffin: That’s it.
Travis: And the lowest it goes is negative two? So.
Griffin: Everybody has— to really make this concrete, everybody has seven hit points. End of story. Everybody has seven hit points, if you lose them all, you die. Like, it is a game that I think is gonna be a lot of d—
Clint: But not really. Like you don’t really die, right?
Griffin: Not IRL.
Travis: Like— yeah. This isn’t, like, Mazes and Monsters or whatever the shit. No, you’ll be fine.
Griffin: Yeah, we’re not Sword Art Online-ing.
Justin: It’s called Jumanji.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: I’m glad we managed to pull three different “if you die in the game, you die in real life” things out there— it’s a rich tapestry. But yeah, the margins are a lot smaller, which I think is gonna be, like, a lot more digestible, but also makes things like a lot more meaningful. If you get hit by a monster for, you know, three harm—big monster gets its claws in you for three harm—that’s almost half your health. You cannot take a lot more than that, or else things start to get very, very bad.
Justin: It also— it also, if I read it correctly, does away with the concept of defense. If you are in— if you engage in a fight, you, and the— and it goes— even if it goes well, you and the monster are both going to do harm to each other.
Griffin: Yeah. So lets get — lets get into that. This game—
Justin: Yes.
Griffin: —has a, it handles most of its action through what it calls Moves, and these— this is, uh, these are eight basic moves that cover more or less every action that a player could take in the game, right? And this is a, this is a very conversational game. We are going to talk about the things that happen, and it is only when you all are describing the hunters’ actions when it becomes apparent that what you are describing is covered by one of these moves, that’s when we get into one of those moves. If at any point during this you say, “I want to Kick Some Ass,” which is the name of one of the moves—
Travis: Absolutely.
Griffin: —you’ve fucked up, because you should be saying, like, “I take my gun and, you know, I’m doing this” or “I get my big sword and I wanna ram it through,” and then it is my job to say, “Okay, that’s a Kick Some Ass roll.” And then we do that.
Travis: Well, that’s one of the things that I really like— so, for example: one of the moves is Help Out.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And you can’t just say, like, “I want to Help Out.”
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s— if you— yeah.
Travis: You have to be able to say, like, “This is the action I want to take, this is what I have in mind,” and it is governed by, like, logic, you know what I mean? So I can’t be like, “I wanna Help Out by…”
Clint: [inhaling sharply through teeth] Ssssssssssssss... Ooooh, logic.
Travis: “...pulling the sun down.” Yeah.
Griffin: [laughs] If you try to— if you try to play this like a game that you’re trying to win constantly, I do not think it’s gonna work. If Justin rolls a six, and neither of you are, like, anywhere close to him, but you really wanna get him up to that seven, and so you’re like, “Ohhh can I think of some way to bullshit this so that it can help out,” like, no. There are going to be lots of failures in this game, and lots of mixed successes in this game, and that’s what makes this stuff, like, so, so interesting, and it’s what gives this game kind of a sense of danger. I don’t think that we’re gonna get to this point in this mini arc, but one of the things that I think is cool about this game is players, like… because of how narrow the margin of error is in fights, for instance, death is, like, pretty common. Not as much as some of the Lovecraftian RPGs where it’s like, “Oh no,” and then you are like, you evaporated again. But it is common, and there are systems for retiring your characters and rolling new ones and then giving that character over to the Keeper to use in whatever story in whatever way they want, which I think is really cool.
Travis and Justin: There’s also a—
Justin: —mechanic for reviving people, bringing people back to life.
Griffin: There are— yeah, which has a huge cost. If it is a direction you wanna go down, you decide like, “Oh I’m not done with this character yet, I wanna keep doing stuff with them,” you can do what’s called Big Magic, which has like— as is always sort of the folk tale, like a horrible cost most of the time. There’s a lot of that flavor.
Travis: I do love, too, that there’s a— once you get enough experience levels, you can opt to create a second character and play both of them at the same time.
Griffin: Yeah, that would be a little—
Travis: It’s a little much.
Griffin: —a little wild.
Travis: Can I read through the actions real quick, Ditto, just to give people an idea of what we’re doing?
Griffin: Yeah, real, real quick, and we’ll give like quick summaries, cause like this is— it’s gonna be a lot real fast, but then take heed: it’s literally all it is for the most part.
Travis: Yeah. So! The first one is Act Under Pressure.
Griffin: This one’s great because it covers pretty much a lot of stuff. One thing to keep in mind is the Keeper never r— I will never roll dice in this game. I will only respond to your successes and your failures, and I can take either what are called Soft Moves, which is like establishing a danger that can like pose a threat to you and set you up to sort of take a move to do something to stop that threat, or I can take Hard Moves, which is like, I hurt you, or I do something bad to you because you have failed somehow. Other than that, like, we don’t roll in combat to contest each other. You roll, and if you succeed, you succeed, and if you fail, you fail, and that’s literally it.
But Act Under Pressure is that same idea but like, if you’re in a burning building or you’re trying to sneak through a laboratory or you’re trying to find the right key to unlock your car while the monster is charging you. All of that stuff is covered under this one move in a really graceful way, I think.
Travis: And you add your Cool score to that, which is not like Fonzie cool, but like “keep your cool” kinda thing.
Griffin: It could be Fonzie cool!
Travis: I guess it could be Fonzie cool. Uh, the next one is—
Clint: Ayyyyyyyy!
Travis: —the next one is Help Out, which pretty much just like it sounds, if you wanna help another player out, [Griffin: Yes] another hunter out, you would roll this. Um, that does not stack, [crosstalk] so you can only add one to their roll.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, no you could only— What’s great about that one is if you fail, or get a mixed success, you open yourself up to repercussions. To, like, the same reper— so you can help out, yeah, but you are also exposing yourself to danger, which is real smart.
Travis: Uh, Investigate A Mystery, which is pretty much like your insight checks, your investigation checks. And what’s cool about that is what you earn when you get a 10 or above, or a 7 or 9, you earn what’s called Holds. And in Investigate A Mystery, the Holds will let you ask these questions, one Hold per question.
Griffin: Yeah, it’s codified. There are specific questions you ask, like “What can the monster do,” and—
Travis: Yeah, so it’s “what happened here”, “what sort of creature is it,” “what can it do,” “what can hurt it,” “where did it go,” “what was it going to do,” and “what is being concealed here.”
Griffin: This is something really important to understand about this game is that the pacing of it is gonna be different in that most of the time it’s really just the one big monster that you’re trying to hunt down. It’s not like you’re gonna be fighting through a dungeon full of skeletons and a bunch of mini-bosses before you get to the— like, a lot of the game is talking to people, and investigating, and learning the monster’s weakness. Which is, like, an actual mechanic. If you don’t hurt the monster with its weakness, you can’t actually kill it. So like, gathering information is the— and setting up your plan— is the bulk of the game. ‘Cause if you don’t do that stuff, you will get killed. Like, guaran— this cannot be a “Magnus rushes in” style adventure [Travis: Nope] because Magnus would be destroyed by this stuff.
Travis: The next one is Kick Some Ass, which is pretty much just like a— it’s fighting. It’s when you—
Clint: Hell yeah!
Griffin: It’s fighting, but like you talked about earlier, it is fighting with damage on both ends, no matter what.
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: And there can be situations where you get the drop on somebody and so you— it’s not a Kick Some Ass, you just hurt them. But in a, like, “you’re hurting me, I’m hurting you”, that’s a Kick Some Ass roll.
Travis: Then there’s Manipulate Someone, which is kinda like a will contest? It’s like [crosstalk] trying to get someone—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Well, it’s like charisma.
Travis: What?
Griffin: It’s like charisma.
Justin: [crosstalk] It’s not particularly useful, I think, to keep filtering these through Dungeons and Dragons lore.
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s fair.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, maybe.
Justin: It’s more useful, I think, to use a fictional counterpart of like, it’s going into the demon bartender and—
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, okay, that’s fair.
Justin: [crosstalk] —and forcing him to tell you what he knows.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, that makes sense.
Travis: Uh, then there’s Protect Someone, which pretty much is what it sounds like—preventing Harm. But in doing so, you take the Harm.
Griffin: Yeah. Or, if you fail, you make things much worse for both of you.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: The collateral damage in these moves is, like, so tasty. And then the last one is Use Magic—
Travis: Well, there’s also Read A Bad Situation.
Griffin: Read A Bad Situation, which is like, feeling when something’s off and like, your spider sense’s tingling a bit. Use Magic is neat, ‘cause there’s like, a bunch of different effects you can do with magic? Like enchant a weapon, or, uh, it’s not like a list of spells, it’s like a list of things you can kind of do with magic, like restrain an enemy. It’s very sort of like, broad effects that you can do, which then you have to describe when you are casting this magic. And, like every other move, there are really really interesting ways that this can go horribly, horribly wrong if you roll poorly. Which I guess we’re gonna get into when we start playing the game. ‘Cause at least— [crosstalk] one of you is a magical one.
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, we’ll definitely roll poorly.
Clint: Yeah, I guarantee we’ll roll poorly.
Griffin: Uh, so those are the moves. Whenever we’re talking about what we’re doing, it’s one of those things. On top of that, there are different, what are called Playbooks, and these are tantamount to classes in other RPGs, where there are these archetypes that are modeled after, like the kind of characters you’d expect to see in one of these shows, like Buffy and Supernatural. And there are some really really cool ones in here— I won’t go over the ones you guys did, but like, there is the Divine, which is like somebody with holy origins? Like, maybe a literal angel. There’s the Expert, who’s kind of like the Giles. The Flake, who is sort of like the, I don’t know the right sort of comparison here, but, y’know like, the weirdo in town—
Travis: It’s The Lone Gunman from The X-Files.
Griffin: Yeah, sure. Like, the Initiate who’s part of this, like, secret order; the Monstrous, who’s actually half monster; the Mundane, which I think is the most interesting one in the game, ‘cuz it’s somebody who doesn’t have powers, but they have like, moves that help the other player out when they get kidnapped by the monster. It’s like the Xander of the team, which I think is really fun. So there’s a bunch of cool ones, but let’s talk really quick about your characters. Or should we talk about the world first…?
Travis: Well, my character’s named Magnus Burnsides… [Clint laughs]
Griffin: Ok, great.
Travis: [crosstalk] He’s a fighter?
Clint: Why don’t we talk about the world first?
Justin: Yeah, I think we talked too much, in our last episode I think we might’ve talked too much about our characters, rather than letting them… Although, that said, we didn’t have a ton of time to like, get into a lot of the [crosstalk] backstory stuff…
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yes. And that said, we’re going to- because we had this question during The The Adventure Zone Zone, when we did that at PodCon, and it got me thinking… the question was something like “Do you think that it harmed something, that you had your characters way more fleshed out for way fewer episodes than you did in Balance, where, like, their evolution was sort of more natural?” And I think there’s a middle ground there, and that middle ground is like, I don’t want to know everything about your characters? I don’t want to, in fact, at this point, we have not all talked together about our characters at the same time, there may be things that we need to, like, workshop here, in this episode, but I don’t- I don’t want us to overextend ourselves, I just wanna know, like, broad sort of things about your character, what inspired you to make this character and, like, what we absolutely need to know about them before we get into the first episode.
Clint: Ditto, why don’t you give us the setting first?
Griffin: Yeah, so, I wanted to—
Travis: And also the tone. Give us the setting and the tone.
Griffin: Yeah. The tone is, like, really- I’ve, in talking to you guys about your characters, I feel like I’ve been sort of… impossible in talking about the tone. ‘Cause I- you may be listening to this and thinking that I’m wanting to do, like, a straight up-and-down, like, horror story? And that is not really what interests me… about this game. So, the game is going to take place in a fictional ski town on the eastern edge of West Virginia, in the Monongahela National Forest— by the way, did you guys know it’s pronounced like that, and not Mon-un-galia?
Travis: I thought it was Mon-un-galia!
Griffin: Well, it’s- there’s a Monongalia County in West Virginia, and that’s where, like, Morgantown is, and apparently they just, like, spelled it wrong once and were like “Cool, that’s the name of the county,” but it’s Monongahela. There’s a- real quick, I don’t wanna go too deep down the rabbit hole, but there’s a real place in West Virginia called Green Bank, is where there is a thing called the Green Bank Telescope, which is actually the world’s largest, like, movable radio telescope? And, it’s in West Virginia, and it’s in this thing called the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, which covers a pretty, actually, huge section of West Virginia and Virginia and Maryland, where you, like, can’t- there’s, like, five radio stations for the whole area, and there’s restrictions on Wi-Fi, and the idea of this, like, highly advanced sort of thing in the middle of very, very low population… area of West Virginia was really interesting to to me. So, Kepler’s kinda close to that—
Clint: 304, baby!
Travis: Alright.
Clint: Okay, that’s not- I’m tryin’ to get started.
Justin: That’s also 681, now.
Griffin: Yeah, there’s a lot of actually different area codes.
Clint: Shit.
Griffin: So Kepler is, like I mentioned, a ski town, but in the fiction of this story, it’s kind of like a- that part of the once-thriving economy of Kepler is now, like, dying off because of Snowshoe, which is another actual town in West Virginia that is more, like, resort-y and nice and people now go there, not Kepler and so… like, that part of the economy is kinda fading away, and so the residents of Kepler kind of banded together to try to find some way to keep the town alive, and there’s lots of different ways to do that, like, it’s a very, like, it’s a very pretty, very scenic place, and so there’s hiking trails and stuff like that. But, there’s also sort of a part of the population that, in an effort to save Kepler, sort of turned it into a cryptozoological destination? There- it’s- there are real places in West Virginia, and Justin, I feel like you have more experience with this, where it’s just like, “Oh, come on down to… y’know, the Sasquatch Zone! Come on down to-” there’s places—
Clint: Point Pleasant has… [crosstalk] the Mothman.
Travis: [crosstalk] The Mothman.
Clint: The Mothman.
Griffin: Yeah, there’s—
Clint: Larry Mothman.
Griffin: There’s a lot of, like, cryptid activity, and I feel like that’s interesting and the causes for it are so interesting, but, also, what if it was all real? And that is sort of what this story is loosely gonna be based on. I have a lot of stuff here about, like, the geography of Kepler? It’s a ski town, there’s like a funicular connecting, like, the top side of town where there’s, like—
Travis: Bunnicula?
Griffin: Fun- funicula? Funicular?
Justin: Bunnicula.
Clint: [singing] Funicu-lee, funicu-laaaa!
Justin: Travis and I are making a lovely Bunnicula joke.
Griffin: Okay. [crosstalk] There’s a cable car—
Justin: [crosstalk] “Joke” is a very strong word.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah! And I have to warn you, here’s a li’l spoiler, it’s not the only Bunnicula reference I’m gonna make in this episode!
Justin: [sarcastically] Wow, looking forward to that!
Griffin: Wow. Well, I have to make sure not to even come close to setting you up for that! But yeah, if you’ve ever been—
Justin: So anyway, the celery stalks at midnight, and— [Travis and Clint laugh]
Griffin: Um, if you’ve ever been to, like, a ski town, like… imagine that. Like, kinda small, I don’t have, like, an exact population in mind, but, like, sort of alpine—
Travis: Two.
Griffin: Two people. Uh, like alpine-inspired architecture, but just, like, not very active? Like, there’s probably some shuttered, Swiss-inspired chalets, that just, like, nobody goes in anymore? There’s also an inn in this town that is going to be kind of the focal point for the story, but I won’t go too much deeper into that, but… to circle back to, like, the tone, I wanted to tell a story about, like—
Justin: [sarcastically] Griffin, you can’t just tease me like that, let me know there’s an inn in this story! [crosstalk]And not give me any more. All these sexy details you’re trickling out!
Clint: [crosstalk] I know!
Griffin: [crosstalk] There’s a very fateful inn.
Justin: [sarcastically] Hold on guys, the new Starlog magazine just showed up, [Clint laughs] front page cover, there’s a [sic] inn with a question mark on it! [crosstalk] Tell us more!
Clint: [crosstalk] “Inn?”
Griffin: I could say more about the inn, I just didn’t wanna spoil it.
Justin: [sarcastically] Whoa, don’t, no, I can’t handle it right now, Griffin, I need to get on my blogs! [Clint laughs] Like, we’re havin’ a lot of fun speculating over here!
Clint: I wonder what Mark Hamill says about the inn.
Griffin: Back in the ’80s, he was like “It’ll never be an inn! I’ll never do an inn!” [Clint laughs] and then he does an inn.
Clint: “We told our story, it’s had an ending, that’s it!”
Griffin: I wanted to tell a story, like, about, like… community and sort of rural communities and the banding together that they sometimes have to do against, like, actual, real forces, whether it be, like, y’know, predatory entities trying to take advantage of them or, y’know, ruin their town… but also have that be, like, what if monsters was that. So, that is kind of- obviously it’s also kind of, like, an idealized rural life. Like, I want this to be a very nice community, a very good community, because I also think that in putting monsters in that particular kind of community, like, it gives you a little bit more to… fight for. Not necessarily Bedford Falls, but, y’know, gettin’ there. So—
Travis: Is it—is the town itself a little spooky, like Twin Peaks, or is it like—
Griffin: Maybe in the way that Twin Peaks is spooky, which is to say that I think if you just look at Twin Peaks and remove all the music and all the creamed corn from it, it actually looks like just a nice place. Um, there are lots of pine trees in Kepler, so I guess it maybe has that in common with it—
Travis: How much creamed corn?
Griffin: I mean, the good kind. Just regular creamed corn, not garmonbozia.
Travis: Okay.
Clint: Are there poplar trees in Kepler?
Griffin: Mostly pines. Mostly pines.
Clint: Ah. ‘Cuz poplar are the most popular in Kepler, I was gonna say, but—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Aw, Jesus.
Justin: [crosstalk with Griffin] I knew you were gonna say that, and you still did.
Clint: Oh I did, didn’t I.
Griffin: Um, there’s also like a biome diversity, like there’s, y’know, a ski mountain and the Monongahela woods on the edge of town, and the Greenbrier River to the south, and—
Travis: A biodome.
Griffin: A sort of biodome, if you will. Also the—
Clint: Oh god, Pauly Shore’s not there, is he?
Griffin: Uh, maybe. Also the U.S. National Radio Quiet Zone gives me a way to write out cellphones [Clint: Yeah, that’s great] from the story, which is gonna be sort of helpful for creat—I feel like a lot of stuff back in like, Buffy days would’ve just been like, “Oh, well, just call them,” and now all the dramatic tension’s gone—
Travis: [crosstalk with Griffin] “Don’t go in there, there’s a vampire.”
Griffin: Yeah. Uh, so yeah!
Clint: Aw shit, how am I gonna play Solitairica?
Griffin: Yeah, well you can play that, just without, y’know—
Travis: You just gotta download it before you go.
Clint: Oh, good good good good good.
Griffin: Oh, by the way, because this is a former ski town, I am profoundly disappointed that none of you made, like, a snowboarder bro, named like, Jake Cool-Ice, [Clint laughs] who just came here to carve shit up.
Travis: Well it’s not too late!
Clint: You can create NPCs, dude!
Griffin: Oh yeah, I mean like, Jake Cool-Ice is gonna be there episode one. Um—
Clint: [doing a cool guy voice, I guess] To the extreme!
Griffin: That is it—
Justin: [crosstalk] Wow, that’s a really good Jake Cool-Ice impression.
Clint: Thank you. [laughs]
Griffin: Uh, there’s a lot more but I do not want to— uh, for the first time, like, I used one big wordpad document to organize everything for Balance and now I’m using Scrivener, so it’s like, I actually have—I feel like I have the whole world at my fingertips, which is very exciting, but I don’t wanna go too much deeper, ‘cuz I think that we should talk about your characters now.
Travis: Who wants to go first?
Clint: I will!
Justin: Okay.
Clint: I’m going with the Crooked. The, uh, the Crooked is basically a criminal. A former criminal.
Griffin: Sort of the— it doesn’t have to be a criminal. It’s sort of like the shady, rogue-like class.
Travis: You’re, uh, what’s-his-face from Fringe.
Griffin: Yeah!
Clint: Peter, Peter.
Travis: Yeah, Peter, who, y’know, has like, been a con-man in the past, or maybe straight-up a thief, or something along those lines.
Clint: Right. Well, my character is um… Is Edmund Chicane. He goes by Ned, and Ned owns a roadside cryptid museum. Kind of a tourist trap-y kinda place. It’s called, he’s named it the Cryptonomica. [Griffin starts clapping] Crypt-onomica.
Griffin: That is— aw Dad, that is like fuckin’, I feel like I just ate a big spoonful o’ honey listenin’ to that. That is the tastiest shit ever.
Clint: He hasn’t lived here very long, but he’s lived here for a couple of years. I think he’s, uh—and when I picture him, I’m picturing probably the greatest actor who ever lived, and that of course is Mr. Brian Blessed. He’s kind of a big guy, kind of a barrel-y kind of—
Griffin: Did he play the Ghost of Christmas Present?

Clint: He was King Vulco on Flash Gordon.
Travis: Oh, of course.
Justin: [sarcastically] Sure, yeah. Everybody remembers that…
Griffin: There’s literally nothing except— I’m going through this IMDB. Folks listening at home trust me, I’m on your side, I’m going through the IMDB trying to find— oh he was in, he played Boss Nass. Well wait, that was a big alien though. You couldn’t really see him, I don’t think.
Clint: If you look at Brian Blessed’s IMDB, he’s a great character, and that’s kind of what Ned is, so Ned—
Griffin: Big bushy beard?
Travis: Big bushy beard!
Justin: He was Colonel Gonville Toast on Toast of London, Trav.
Travis: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Griffin: That’s nothing to so many people. He played the voice of Santa Claus in The Amazing World of Gumball. [sarcastically] You all know! You all know!
Justin: He’s Grampy Rabbit on Peppa Pig.
Griffin: Okay. You avoided the question about the big bushy beard.
Clint: Um, yeah! Let’s go with big bushy beard.
Griffin: I mean I’m just looking at pictures of Brian Blessed. He doesn’t not have a beard in any of them.
Travis: He’s the voice of Clayton in the Disney Tarzan.
Griffin: Okay, we’re done talking about Brian Blessed’s storied career.
Clint: Brian Blessed, now you know. And so, Ned has this museum all about cryptids. The cryptids in the area, and that’s all I’m ready to say about him right now.
Griffin: Just to— I do want to talk about the playbook. So the playbook gives you basically a couple more moves usually on top of the basic stuff, but they are very situation-specific things. So which— so for the Crooked there are like, crime backgrounds that kind of give some flavor to your character like—
Clint: Ned is a grifter.
Griffin: Okay. I was assuming he wasn’t an assassin [chuckle], which is one of them.
Clint: No, there is a certain level of uh… sham built into this whole museum thing. Not that it wouldn’t be useful, but it may be full of all kinds of helpful stuff, but he doesn’t know it.
Griffin: I love that. When you told me this angle like, that is what stood out to me as the best shit, is there’s a guy who runs a curio museum that he thinks everything in it is bullshit, when actually some of it is real. [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Right, and that’s kind of what’s going on with Ned. He knows all about it, because, y’know, it’s not like they’ve got a lot of entertainment options, so he’s actually read every book in the place, and he’s looked at all the stuff. He just doesn’t believe it, and he doesn’t know what’s powerful or not powerful.
Griffin: I also love, like, I talked about, like, Kepler has these different sort of things that people are doing to try and keep the town going since nobody really comes there to ski and stay in their resorts or anything anymore. And I like this idea of like, there are some people in town who are just like, “Come to Kepler, we got beautiful river trails you can walk down. You can hike through the woods, and rest up in one of our nice places,” and then there’s also a group of people who are like, “We got Bigfoot!”
Clint: [laughter]
Griffin: And the friction between those two who are like, “Hey, can you please stop telling everybody we have Bigfoot, because we’re trying to get people to come and hike in the woods and stuff.”
Clint: Like the people who probably work at the Roswell Art Museum.
Griffin: Yeah, like, “Come on—”
Clint: “Will you guys shut up, will ya?”
Griffin: So there’s also moves. Every class has got, like, special moves—
Clint: I got one I picked. I want driver.
Griffin: Driver, okay.
Clint: I want him to be a driver, because I figured there are gonna be times maybe where we need to travel, maybe not much, but I had this— I already figured out, I want him to drive a 1958 Lincoln Continental Mark 3.
Griffin: You know I’m going to have to Google that.
Clint: Oh, Google it! Because it is the most trunk space of any American-made vehicle in history—
Griffin: Oh Jesus Christ, this car.
Clint: I’m looking with all this trunk space—
Griffin: Is this a drop-top convertible?
Clint: They came in both a hard-top and a convertible. Rag-top and a hard-top. So, we can figure that out, but I want him tooling around in this gigantic car, with this humongous trunk to haul stuff in. And, according to the game, since I get to pick out two vehicles—
Griffin: You do get two vehicles if you go with driver.
Clint: I have a second vehicle, and so, [laugh] he’s gonna have an Alpina Superclass 1.2. It’s got a 12-valve engine—
Justin: 1.2 what?
Clint: I don’t know, it says 1.2 VVTs [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Gigahertz... of power…
Griffin: This is a snowmobile that has three seats on the back. Which is a lot.
Clint: It hauls a three-seat trailer and has three seats on the main thing. It goes up to 40 miles an hour.
Travis: Jesus, dad, why didn’t you just get like, an invisible jet?
Clint: So he’s got these two vehicles. I figure he can do a lot of tooling around and be the chauffeur. And the other one I really wanted to go with was artifact.
Griffin: Okay, yeah, I think that makes the most sense.
Clint: The thing is, if he has an artifact, he just doesn’t know it.
Griffin: So this is a magic artifact, and you get to basically build it from a list, so you can give yourself protective armor, or a skeleton key that opens any magically sealed lock. It’s like a bunch of different effects, but you don’t know that it does these things probably.
Clint: That’s it. In keeping with Ned’s story, he does not know that it has the powers.
Griffin: That’s very good. This is going to be like, this is the character that has me like, excited for all the different ways to have you interact with [Kepler]. This feels the most lived in, you are a resident of this town, and there’s like a lot of different friction and stuff between you and the town. Like, I think this is going to be really cool.
Clint: So just remember, just visualize Peppa Pig’s grandfather.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: Perfect.
Griffin: Travis, you go next.
Travis: My character, she is a Spell-Slinger named Lady Flame.
Griffin: Well, what’s her real name?
Travis: Her real name is Aubrey Little. She is a magician—
Griffin: Lady— Pronounce it. Is it [separate, with emphasis] Lady Flame or [faster, as one phrase] Ladyflame?
Travis: It’s “The Lady Flame.” Y’know, I’m trying to look at it as much more magical— it’s not, y’know, she’s the Lady—
Griffin: Travis wanted to play a magical one, and so he picked the most magical class, and made it the most magical magic that could possibly magic. This is Travis’ repressed, like, desire to use magic in a game, sort of manifest.
Justin: Anyway, she runs the local pet salon—
[All laugh]
Travis: So she is a magician, up and coming.
Clint: Like a stage magician?
Travis: Yes, stage magician.
Griffin: I was really hesitant about allowing you to do this, because again, I wanted more grounded characters and a more real world feel. But then I remembered when we were at MaxFunCon East in that resort in the Poconos, there was a magician who like, was playing in the lobby. Like I feel like that’s not that weird when somebody’s on the starting circuit, that they’re not doing big shows, they’re like, playing in the lobbies of hotels and stuff.
Travis: Also, her style is very like, goth punk-y magician, and I think that, my concept for it is that it’s a little off-putting to people who expect like, a female magician to be kind of in like, tights and a sparkly vest, y’know?
Griffin: Yeah, not that there’s anything— I mean, that is a specific style of performance. It feels weird to like… slam that in any way? [crosstalk] Because it is like, a specific way of performing.
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh I’m not at all. She just isn’t that. [Griffin: Yeah] Yeah. And so, she’s kind of goth punk kind of look, with just a sick undercut. You know what I mean? Just a really cool, like pompadour undercut. Her hair is amazing. She’s got some facial piercings in there. Really cool, really badass.
Griffin: We should make one thing kind of clear, is that, and this is something that we talked about, and I don’t know where you are at on it now, but this pilot arc is kind of going to be like, “Uh oh, my magic is real.”
Travis: Yes, absolutely. Currently, she does not know that she has access to any kind of actual magic. So her magic is all like, sleight of hand. She specializes in, like, pyrotechnic sleight of hand.
Griffin: So like, Gob with just lighter fluid shooting out of somebody’s shirt?
Travis: Yes, very much so. Basically, what I pictured was, she has these gloves that very much like the flame alchemist in Fullmetal Alchemist have, y’know, kind of a flint kind of thing. So she can snap her fingers to make— so basically, there’s a reason for this. One of the moves of the Spell-Slinger is tools and technique, so you have four options: consumables, foci, gestures, and incantations, and you have to have access to three of them, or you take a penalty.
Griffin: Yeah, your spells get fucked up. This is a really elegant way of doing something that we never did in D&D, which is, in D&D, you remember that there were somatic spells, and verbal spells, and you had components, and you had different— like, this is that same thing but boiled down to like, “Oh you can cast it, but if you don’t have one of your things then you take a penalty to it.”
Travis: So, that’s why like, her gloves are her foci—
Griffin: Okay, I’m into that.
Travis: —and like, the consumables are the flammable liquid, and, y’know, certain shavings of very flammable metal, that kind of thing. And her gestures are all of the things that she has worked in: the flourishes, the sleight of hand, all of that. So I’m basing what will eventually be her actual magic around those same things. She is a— her combat magic is blast-based.
Griffin: Okay, I wanted to talk to you about this. So you get to basically build your main combat spell when you go as a Spell-Slinger. You went with blast and fire, and I think you did that just so you could get the most damage out of attacks, because—
Travis: No, that was just my style of— because it’s also very— so the different attacks have different qualities, so like, hers is obvious and loud, and that just made the most sense to me of like, the character I was building. And also, right now, especially, I was thinking, because she’s going to have so little control over it, fire magic inherently has a lot of glitches and stuff that go with it, of it being very dangerous.
Griffin: It spreads, and— this is, keep in mind, every time Travis attacks with this stuff he’s going to roll, and him basically creating a controlled explosion of fire every time he attacks, if he ever fucks up, is going to put a huge, flaming arrow in my quiver, that I can, and — fair warning — absolutely will use against you guys.
Travis: Yeah, so basically, I’m trying to think a lot of like a character in which, like, entropy and chaos springs forth, both in personality and in her combat style.
Griffin: I’m also very into dropping a character like that into a quaint, rural, like, town. I think, again, there’s some friction there that I think can be very cool. I think we’ll have to work to make sure that it never gets sort of, tonally weird.
Travis: Yes, absolutely. My thinking was, just to justify it, I think that her family is not necessarily from the area of Kepler, but like, somewhere in the Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky region.
Griffin: I’m thinking of this character as sort of the audience surrogate, at least in the pilot, in that she is the only character, as far as I know, who doesn’t like, live in Kepler, and is not from Kepler.
Travis: Correct, yeah, she’s like, just gotten there.
Griffin: So like, I can introduce the town to the audience through Aubrey.
Travis: And, most importantly, I think, is that her travelling companion is a 10-pound New Zealand rabbit named Dr. Bonkers.
Clint: [laughter]
Griffin: Alright, and what class is Dr. Bonkers?
Travis: Dr. Bonkers is a white rabbit with red eyes, very much like Bunnicula.
Griffin: Okay, excellent.
Clint: Ah, there it is!
Griffin: He is of the Wronged playbook. [crosstalk] His whole family was murdered by vampires.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, he is Monstrous.
Griffin: Don’t give me that. I’ll use that. You know I’ll use that.
Travis: He is formerly a laboratory experiment rabbit that she rescued through semi-questionable means, perhaps. And Dr. Bonkers, his first name is Harris. Dr. Harris Bonkers—
[someone snorts]
Travis: —travels with her now. And there’s nothing special about him, other than the fact that he’s awesome.
Griffin: I’m going to make the rabbit something.
Travis: Maybe someday, but right now [crosstalk] he’s just Dr. Harris Bonkers.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, very quickly. I’m going to give the rabbit superpowers.
Travis: Okay, well he has a PhD in Philosophy.
Griffin: Justin, you wanna start talking about your character and interrupt Travis?
Justin: Yeah, so my character’s named Duck Newton. And he is the Chosen.
Griffin: Justin, you’re so fuckin’ good at naming characters, that’s very good!
Travis: I tried so hard, I went with The Lady Flame, and I was like “Ah, got it!” and then you’re fuckin’ Fig Newton or whatever.
Griffin: Duck Newton. Juice Newton!
Justin: Duck Newton is— Duck’s his nickname— the, he’s the Chosen, and Griffin initially sort of tried to ward us off from this, because—
Griffin: Yeah, there were two playbooks I didn’t want you to use, and it was the Chosen and the Wronged, because the Wronged was so grimdark, like, it literally is “Your family’s murdered and so now you’re this rebel without a cause!” and that feels way off-tone. But—
Justin: Yeah, so Duck’s a, Duck’s the Chosen, but he— the thing about Duck is he didn’t, I guess. He started having these— when he was a younger man, he started having sorts of visions and nightmares that sort of led him to— what his sort of, like, destiny was, to fight back some unnamed evil, and he ran from that destiny, he avoided it at all costs, he wanted to— he was scared, basically, and he— so he manifested some sort of, y’know, whatever abilities you wanna call it, but he decided not to use them and instead became a park ranger at the Monongahela National Forest and he sort of decided to make a quiet life doing that. So that is where we sort of find him when the story begins.
Griffin: The Chosen has some, like— I wanna be clear when we’re talking about the Chosen, in that I do not wanna set up a— this is why I didn’t wanna do the Chosen, I don’t wanna set up a dynamic between your three characters, where Duck is the, The Chosen One, Hero of Legend, Buffy, while everybody else is Duck’s supporting cast. [crosstalk] I’m—
Justin: [crosstalk] Right. (Justin says this sheepishly, agreeing with Griffin) That’s certainly how it’s designed—
Griffin: [crosstalk] That is how it’s designed and I’m not interested in that, narratively or, like, I don’t think it’s fun for you guys, ‘cause then you are literally— you are supporting cast members in this, which I think is not a cool way to do this— this show.
Justin: That said, the system is sort of flexible enough that I was able to not bend the rules and just sort of make a character that, like, fits this, I think, but is not— y’know, the Chosen, just keep in mind, when we say “the Chosen” it is a, it is the name of the class, not necessarily narratively, [crosstalk], um power—
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’m thinking about it this way, you were chosen, by something, and I kind of have an idea of what that could be, just in the world fiction, like I have an idea. That doesn’t mean that you are the only thing that matters, y’know what I mean?
Justin: Duck’s not the Chosen, he’s [crosstalk] a Chosen.
Travis: [crosstalk] A Chosen. [laughs]
Griffin: He was chosen.
Justin: Right.
Travis: He’s like a high school football star, and somebody was like “Hey! You’re gonna come play in the NFL!” and he was like “No.”
Griffin: There’s some really- we haven’t—
Travis: I really like this idea of a Chosen that’s just like [crosstalk] “No, no thank you!”
Griffin: [crosstalk] “No, thanks.” I mean, that’s very, very, very cool from, like, my perspective, because then I have ways of, like, trying to tempt you into- we talked about this not going to be an ongoing, like, every episode Duck’s like “Ehhh, I dunno!” like, this is a story about this coming to a head. I wanna talk about about the moves really, really, really fast just to, like, highlight a couple of them in Duck’s, like, category, ‘cause this is what sold the game for me, were the playbooks and the special moves, ‘cause they are so perfectly tailored to hit this genre, and try to take the things that you, like, love about the characters in this monster of the week genre and turn them into game mechanics. So, like, the Chosen has a move called “The Big Entrance” where you make a showy entrance into a dangerous situation and, if you roll really good, everybody has to stop and listen to your speech. [Clint laughs] Like, it’s a way of, like, setting up different scenes in the way that you want them. There’s…
Justin: I didn’t pick that one.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: That sounded like a lot of pressure. [laughs]
Griffin: It does sound like a lot of pressure. But there’s stuff, like, you get a thing called Destiny’s Plaything, where, at the beginning of each mystery, you roll some dice, and on a success, you get, like, a vision of the future, which is, like, y’know, dreams, like Buffy’s dreams of, like- which, I think, kind of stopped being a thing after, like, season one or two. But yeah, there’s some really, really- [crosstalk] that’s the kind of, like, flavor that I love.
Justin: [crosstalk] I actually gave him- that move rolls against a skill called Weird, which is basically, like, magical stuff in this world and to sort of set the table considering where he has been and what has been happening, I actually gave Duck a -1 skill in Weird.
Griffin: So your visions aren’t gonna be the best.
Justin: So the visions aren’t great ‘cause he’s like been purposefully out of touch with this side of himself.
Griffin: Yeah. [crosstalk] That’s cool.
Travis: [crosstalk] Love that. Can I just say one more thing about this game, that I love, just to like sell the game. As I was reading through it, the different classes and stuff, as someone who’s, like, grown up and fallen in love with all these different monster of the week kind of shows, like literally every class, one they give great examples for, but two every class I read was like, “Oh I wanna play that. Oh I wanna play that.” And like the reason I went with Spell-Slinger is that one of my favorite book series is the Harry Dresden, The Dresden Files.
Griffin: Which is also- they list this in this book [Travis: Yes!] as an inspiration.
Travis: Exactly! I saw that and was like, “Oh shit, yeah, this,” and so like it’s such a love note to monster of the week like, I mean obviously. But in a way that’s like, I’m so excited to play and match the tone of that and the feeling of it and like— ah, I’m really excited about this.
Justin: Now here’s my question before we move on, and I don’t know if this is something we wanna do in the first episode or not, but there is a mechanic for history in the game.
Griffin: I’m not— this feels like four people sitting around a table playing it not for… a podcast. Which is not to- I don’t mean to sound like I’m diminishing that. It’s that- I mean we can talk about this [crosstalk] absolutely.
Justin: [crosstalk] Now the pushback I would have against that is that I do think that it’s worth coming to a consensus on the relationships of these characters, because I don’t necessarily want to do another story where we’re starting ya know [crosstalk] from square one.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Sure. Yeah that’s a good- then this is a good middle ground. I would assume that you all don’t have a relationship with Aubrey just because you’re not from here, necessarily.
Travis: Well-
Justin: I was thinking that maybe- when he was talking about fire, uh, I was thinking it might be fun if maybe Aubrey has tried to use the forest to practice before and Duck has had to chase her off. So he has like a little bit of a relationship there and I thought that was kinda fun but I don’t know if that, like, jives with you, Trav.
Travis: No, I think that works. Let’s say that it was, like, on her way to Kepler, like she camped out in the forest one night, and was practicing and Duck came and reprimanded her and made her dump out her beer- a thing that has happened to me before in a national forest. [laughter]
Justin: So you’re just drawing on your real life experiences. I watched it y’all, it was so sad.
Clint: ‘Cause being drunk and campfires go so well together.
Justin: Travis had this grand plan about camping by himself for, like, a couple days and when we got there, he was just, like, dumping out a beer while a ranger looked on disapprovingly. [Clint laughs] It’s like- you could tell, like, “Aw, you’re not gonna be out here for the long haul, huh Scraps?”
Travis: It was not great.
Griffin: You called me to come up the first night.
Travis: It gets real dark and scary out there, y’all!
Griffin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, I like that. I’m curious what the- because you all- do you, does Duck live in Kepler?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Ok. So, I think Duck and Ned-
Clint: Wait a minute, and is Duck a forest ranger, did you say? So he’s not gonna have that much- I mean, right? I mean, wouldn’t he be at the station most of the time?
Justin: What do you mean?
Clint: The forest station, I mean.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, I think that’s-
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, but he lives in Kepler.
Travis: And then you have to worry about, like, if you’re not there, then it’s deforestation.
Griffin: [exasperated, leans away from the mic] Jesus, Travis.
Justin: I think it’s fun if he and Ned are friends. I think that that’s something we could have.
Griffin: I would love that so much more than “They kind of dislike each other.”
Justin: No, I think it’s kind of, like, they’re complimentary people, but I think that, like, it makes sense that they would be friendly.
Clint: And I think that brings a nice dichotomy because if Ned is kind of a shady, somewhat crooked character and Duck is kind of an authority figure, it has kind of a nice feel to it.
Travis: I would like to play with knowing- I mean, I think it’s interesting, right? Because this game has this mechanic of everybody knows each other, which is weird to try to force into it, but I do like this idea, especially considering that Ned has some sort of shady background. And I don’t know what the connection is yet, but if there is something where maybe in his previous existence, Aubrey has encountered him before.
Griffin: If you like that and Dad likes that, let’s do that and literally stop now and don’t say anything else to try to firm it up, but you know something about Ned’s history that maybe you don’t even know that you know it. Like, I think that could be something great.
{50:56}
Clint: I have a little something, too. And this might not be something you- I don’t know if you want this in there, but what if something in the Cryptonomica triggers Aubrey’s powers.
Griffin: I mean, something triggers Aubrey’s powers in episode one, and there’s a big thing that I haven’t really talked about yet that is sorta like the reason why monsters are here that is probably going to fill that need? But, I mean, it’s all connected. Like, the things in the Cryptonomica are also kind of from this source. Also, Justin, do you want to talk about the cool connection we thought of for the Cryptonomica?
Justin: Yeah, you also have my weapon. The Chosen gets a weapon and you have my weapon, and I- maybe I gave it to you? ‘Cause, like, it seemed like the safest thing ‘cause you deal in stuff like this—
Clint: Hide in plain sight.
Justin: Yeah, that you could sort of keep it, y’know, safe for me. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: This is a big thing for the Chosen, that you, like, build a weapon from a form and a business end and a material, and I don’t know if Justin’s firmed that up yet, but I love the idea—
Justin: Oh yeah, I did! [crosstalk] It rules.
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, he did.
Griffin: [crosstalk] What is it? What is it?
Justin: What?
Griffin: Ok, I guess we don’t have to talk about it.
Justin: You want me to tell you about the weapon? Or you want me to wait ‘til the show?
Clint: [crosstalk] No! No, no, no, no, no!
Griffin: We’ll save it, we’ll save it.
Travis: Okay, shit, ‘cause I just thought of what had been my plan for Aubrey and the thing- okay, I have a way to connect Ned and Aubrey that I will tell dad about later. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I’m gonna show Dad the video of my weapon after.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: [intensely] There’s a video? Okay. So, I guess- I think that’s about it, I think that’s all you really need to know. I think the playbooks are free, a free resource. If you are interested in Monster of the Week, you can go check those out and sort of get an idea of what the different stuff is. But I’m really excited about this game—
Justin: You can read ours in about five minutes if you’re interested in a little more context. You can read the playbooks for our characters, just the three of ours.
Griffin: It’s gonna be really- I’m really excited about- I’m nervous about it ‘cause there’s- I cannot prepare as much as I prepared in Balance. The game will not work if I try to make things try to follow a path the same way that I kinda tried to make it do in D&D. This is a game where things are gonna go wrong constantly and we all have to improvise together to figure out where it goes next, which is cool for me in a, like- it’s not going to be as hard to prep this stuff, but it’s also going to be a little bit tougher to make sure things have, like, satisfying conclusions and cohesive narrative arcs and stuff like that. But I’m so, so, so excited to get started, which is gonna be next Thursday. Yeah, anything else y’all wanna talk about before we hop off here?
Travis: Well, Dr. Harris Bonkers attended Vassar. [Clint laughs]
Justin: Ok.
Clint: Hats off to Michael Sands by the way, the writer and creator of Monster of the Week. And our friends at Evil Hat Productions, who also were involved with the Fate system, too.
Griffin: Yeah, it’s a beautiful game, and there’s a lot of really, really cool Powered by the Apocalypse games that I was interested in doing, but this one seems like such a, like—
Justin: Maybe we’ll dip back into one of those, ‘cause it would be nice to not have to start from square one every time, mechanically.
Travis: I actually- I was telling Griffin before we recorded, I really like this system, I might end up doing my arc in it. Maybe not Monster of the Week, like a Powered by the Apocalypse-style system, but—
Griffin: If you didn’t love The Stolen Century, I would encourage you to give these episodes a shot because, while I did try to model those rules after that, it was not nearly as fleshed out or codified as these rules are, to wit, like, I didn’t necessarily do a great job handling, like, mixed successes, which is a really interesting thing in this system where, “Yeah, you get to do the thing, but there’s a cost.” In this game, like, the costs are laid out and very, very interesting. [crosstalk] There’s a lot more weight.
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s one of the things I love ‘cause, like, the Investigate a Situation, right? You can’t just say like- you can’t ask, “Why is this?” There are specific- there’s this loose specificity to this game that I really love.
Griffin: And it is perfect for what we’re trying to do. It’s perfect for playing a game but also creating a story that you are presenting to other people, which is such a tricky needle to thread. And as much as I love D&D, like, that was a thing that we bumped into a lot because those rules are not necessarily made for, what, like, third-person presentation to other people, but I think these rules are gonna fit that a lot better.
Clint: I think it sounds awesome, I can’t wait. Let’s start now.
Griffin: Alright. No. We’re gonna—
Clint: It was a dark and stormy night. [laughs]
Griffin: It might be, but you’ll have to wait ‘til next week to find out.
Justin: And all the shit was so creepy and weird.
Clint: Everything was really weird.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh nooo.
Travis: [crosstalk] And then things got stranger and stranger.
Griffin: Bye, everybody!

edit | edit source
Griffin: We see a carpet of pine needles laid out over the quiet floor of the Monongahela National Forest. Bright light is beaming down from the waxing, nearly-full moon overhead. It is summer in Kepler, West Virginia, and it is still. In this particular neck of the woods, not a creature is stirring. The tall pines all around are motionless, bathing in this moonlight. There are no howls from the forest’s depths. No frogs rattling in the creeks that criss-cross the terrain. No crickets whistling their summer song. Kepler is quiet too. Its citizens have long since retired for the day, the steady hum of the funicular that connects the town to the ski slopes above ceased operations hours ago.
Signs for the businesses catering to Kepler’s night owls flicker and dim as their proprietors close up shop. Soft lights in the town’s windows extinguish one by one, save for the office window of the Amnesty Lodge, on the outskirts of Kepler’s topside, where the manager sips her evening tea, peering expectantly out this window and into the forest beyond. And back in those woods, a stone archway stands in the centre of a small clearing, the waxing moon reaches its zenith in the starlit sky above. The carpet of pine needles begins to vibrate in soft pulses, away from the center of this clearing, and, in an instant, the span of the arch is filled with the moonlight above, and the carpet of needles is stripped away as sharp winds blow outward and away from the clearing in every direction.
{Music 1:54-2:08}
Griffin: The moon’s reflection on the archway dims. The owner of the Amnesty Lodge finishes her evening tea and extinguishes the last light of Kepler, West Virginia.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: Okay, hi everybody, welcome to the Adventure Zone first proper episode of what we’re calling The Adventure Zone: Amnesty. It’s a new mini arc that I’m doing— [crosstalk]
Travis: Can I- I know we just started, but what about Kablamnesty?
Griffin: Yeah, let’s just go ahead and change it to Kablamnesty. I think it’s better on pretty much every conceivable level, and like fuck me for my bad idea.
Travis and Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Uh, so-
Travis: and Haam-haam-kablamnesty.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s a reference that nobody is gonna get. So, I guess a few things? One, I’m sick, and so this is- the characters you hear in this episode that I do are probably not—
Clint: They’re all sick.
Griffin: They’re all sick. It’s not what they’re gonna sound like. Imagine just, I guess, a couple semitones higher, and not as gravelly. Um, but, the other thing is, so for this first episode I was thinking of the best way to introduce your guys characters and make them sort of more concrete with the short amount of time we’re gonna have in this arc. And what I think we’re gonna do is, for this first episode, your characters are going to be kind of individual. I have a couple basically individual scenes for each of your characters, before you all sort of form your group in the second episode. So that’s gonna be the structure for today. Also kind of like how we did arcs in the Balance campaign? This first episode is kinda gonna be more setup of the world and the mystery and then I’m gonna sort of set you guys loose in episode two. So that’s what we’re going to be doing today. Anything else before we get started?
Travis: I wanna say a quick thank you to someone whose name I did not catch, but at PodCon, a volunteer gave me this really cool metallic six-sided dice, and it’s red, and I think it’s perfect for Lady Flame and so I’m going to be using it in the show.
Griffin: Well, you will need another one. Everybody needs two six-sided dice for Monster of the Week.
Travis: Yeah, I have two! I have two. I wanted to say thank you to them and I’m sorry I did not catch their name. But if you’re listening, I’m using that dice and I appreciate you.
Griffin: Should mention that we are playing Monster of the Week, new game. If you listen to our setup episode, we kind of briefly go over the rules. But it’s gonna be really cool and the rules I think are gonna be pretty apparent. Even if you didn’t listen to the setup episode, I think you’re not gonna have any problem following along. So y’all ready?
Clint: Kudos to Michael Sands.
Griffin: Yeah, well done Michael.
Clint: [mumbling] The creator of Monster of the Week.
Griffin: Uh, sorry, I’m just turning up my audio a little bit, okay. Alright, you guys ready to get going?
Clint: Yeah!
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: Is it too late to give Lady Flame a motorcycle with a sidecar that Dr. Harris Bonkers rides around in?
Griffin: It is absolutely too late and, uh, before we get started, Duck- you have a vision of the future. Roll plus Weird for Destiny’s Plaything.
Justin: Uh, 7.
Griffin: A 7 is a mixed success. Can you tell me what it says for Destiny’s Plaything when you roll a 7-9?
Justin: “At the beginning of each mystery, roll plus Weird to see what is revealed about your immediate future. On a 7-9, you get a vague hint about it.”
Griffin: Alright. Uh, Duck, you see a vision, and it’s a pretty simple vision. You’re in the Monongahela Forest and your vision is kind of obscured a little bit by the branches of the pines in this forest, but through them, you can make out a shape. You see a stone archway, just a few dozen yards away. Um, it almost sort of resembles like a Stonehenge archway, it’s just three slabs of solid stone with two sticking out of the ground, with one sort of balanced, perched between them, and it almost feels like this archway is beckoning you. And then there’s a sharp gust of wind that comes off this archway and right as it hits you, you wake up. And you wake up to the sound of a phone ringing at your desk, where you are working an overnight shift in the ranger station, in your leg of the Monongahela National Forest, right on the outskirts of Kepler, West Virginia, the town in which you live. You did some research, Justin, on this exact subject, so please correct me if I use sort of the wrong terminology at any point.
Justin: [crosstalk] [laughing] Okay, I’ll do my best.
Griffin: But what is a day patrolling the trail like for Duck? Like, what does Duck’s like, job look like here in the forest?
Justin: Forest rangers in the Monongahela National Forest are district rangers who are largely resource specialists, so they’re more like science people, as I understand it. But- so I’m taking a little bit of liberty here, with Duck, because it’s not necessarily a park, so he’s sort of- a lot of his work, I think, is monitoring tree growth, checking for diseased trees. I like that idea, like keeping the trails clean. I think he takes a lot of pride in it, and is sort of careful about making sure that it’s on a good tilt.
Griffin: I dig that. I think, just to sort of make this a little bit more action-oriented, like to get you into the action a little bit more, I’m thinking, like, because during this graveyard shift in the forest, I think you are also kind of wearing the hat of a park ranger. Also, which is not something you typically do, but like, answering, you know, distress calls about [crosstalk] you know—
Justin: [crosstalk] Sure.
Griffin: —Shitty campers or something like that. Um, and speaking of, the phone rings, and it’s sort of the first thing that’s sort of broken the silence of this quiet, late summer evening. It’s a really nice night: There’s a nice breeze coming up off the Greenbrier River, and the sort of balmy heat of August is finally starting to fade away. And you get this distress call, where somebody is complaining about, uh, at the Park and Camp RV grounds, sort of on the outskirts of the forest, someone was making a ton of noise, uh just a little bit ago. And you’ve also gotten some reports from passing trail-walkers that there’s a big bonfire going on right in the middle of their campground, which Smokey would tell you is not acceptable behavior. And, so this is what brings you—
Travis: [impersonating Smokey Bear] Woah, you’ve got to shut that shit down, Duck!
Griffin: Uh, we could introduce- Smokey- Is Smokey a cryptid? [Travis laughs] Have we talked about this?
Travis: [emphatically] Yes.
Clint: [sarcastic] A talking bear wearing blue jeans, hm.
Griffin: Yeah, I think absolutely. So Duck, this is what brings you to the Park and Camp lot 5 a little after 6 o’clock p.m. And at this lot, you see a mid-sized RV parked in its appropriate space, but it looks like it was recently kind of wrecked. The front driver’s side corner of the car is just crumpled up, the headlights just gone, um, the lot’s trash receptacle has been upended and is similarly kind of roughed up and its contents are laying all around the lot. And just as these complaints attested, there’s a big fire roaring in the middle of the lot, in a pit. It’s not quite a bonfire anymore, but you can tell from the charred wood that’s rolled away from the pit that it probably used to be. And the lights inside of this RV are turned off. What do you do?
Justin: Uh, can I Read a Bad Situation?
Griffin: So, yes, this is our first move that you can do, but remember, and I think this is something we’re all gonna have to get used to, you don’t just say the move that you’re doing. I want you to tell me what Duck is doing and then you’d Read a Bad Situation, right. So it is narrative descriptor first, move second. Does that make sense?
Justin: Alright, got it. Yes. Uh, so I’m gonna take out my mag light and just sort of do a sweep of what I can see and, uh, try to get a lay of the land before I rush into anything.
Clint: Is Duck strapped?
Justin: Uh-
Griffin: So this is— we didn’t talk about guns in the setup episode, but like, unless your character has a fuckin’ really good, solid reason to carry a firearm with them, which is also something I have plans for, because I don’t love the idea of an arc where just like it’s a bunch of gun-totin’ shootin’ shooter folks all the time. So unless you have a really good reason to have a gun, I would say definitely not.
Justin: Yeah, I don’t—
[crosstalk]
Clint: I was thinking of animals and—
Travis: I should probably change mine then, because in my gear I picked a gun, but I can go with Heirloom Sword, that feels magician-y.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: I think in general, for weapons, don’t stress about weapons. I want to ground your characters in the real before we do, like, stuff like that. And pick weapons, but I might just give them to you at some point during this arc, but you wouldn’t start with them, because you are not, you know, monster hunters right now. But we’re delaying, so go ahead and roll plus Sharp, which is the stat that you use for Read a Bad Situation.
Justin: Ten.
Griffin: Alright! That’s our first “great success”!
Travis: [laughs] No!
Justin: I Hold three on a ten.
Griffin: Yes, so uh, when you Read a Bad Situation, you roll plus Sharp, and on a 10, you get three Hold. And Hold you spend immediately to answer- t-to ask me the following questions, which I will answer based on what you said you were going to do. So you said you were flashing your light around this scene, looking around, uh, so I can answer a lot of stuff for you. And then, what’s really cool about this is whenever you act on the answers, you get plus one to your rolls, ongoing. So go ahead and pick your questions, and I will answer them.
Justin: Are there any dangers I haven’t noticed?
Griffin: You, while you are looking around this scene, you hear the sound of a shotgun shell, uh being loaded into a shotgun, just behind the door of the RV. Um, you actually can tell that, like, whoever’s doing it must be kind of nervous, because you heard some rattling and some, like, scraping as they were trying to put this shell in. But you hear a shotgun shell go into a shotgun in the RV.
Justin: What’s my best way in?
Griffin: I mean the best way into the RV is obviously the front door, but sort of building off of the last thing that you noticed, your best way in would be very very cautiously and not trying to startle or suprise the person inside.
Justin: What’s the biggest threat?
Griffin: [laughs] The person with the shotgun inside the RV.
Justin: Well, I mean obviously.
Griffin: Yeah sometimes that’s just what the answer’s gonna be. [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah I mean.
Griffin: Yeah, there’s not much- I mean the fire could potentially be dangerous but it looks like it’s dying out and you get the idea that in a few minutes, this things gonna fall apart and that won’t be a threat to the forest, but um, obviously the person with the shotgun inside that RV could be a situation that you’re gonna have to deal with.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: So while you’re acting on that stuff, then you get a plus one to your rolls, but because you rolled so well, you have a pretty comprehensive understanding of what’s going on: There’s a nervous person with a shotgun inside that RV.
Justin: I call out, pretty loudly.
Griffin: Let’s hear that voice.
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Duck: Excuse me?
Griffin: As soon as you yell that, a shotgun blast shoots through the door, which you are not anywhere near. It doesn’t shoot quite through the door, as just sort of a buckshot blasts, you see just sort of a big dent form and you hear a sort of a yelp come from inside the RV.
Justin: I pull out my radio.
Duck: I’m over at lot 5. I’m gonna need some, ugh, police support, I guess. I’ll keep you updated with the situation. I’m not engaging, obviously, but keep me updated.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: [muffled, radio voice] 1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12
[Griffin laughs]
Travis: [muffled, radio voice] … at lot 5.
Griffin: What do you do? Do you wait patiently for the police to arrive to play the roleplaying game?
Justin: [laughs] No, I just wanted to- I’m trying to do what I would do in the real situation, which I don’t think he’d be like, “All right motherfucker, time to go!”
[Everyone laughs]
Justin: [muffled, radio voice]: … fucking chucks his radio at him.
Griffin: After, um, after the shotgun blasts through the door, you hear a voice from inside go:
Shotgun Person: Aw shit, I’m sorry! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Sorry sorry sorry! Are you okay out there? Did I hit anybody?
Duck: You are, my friend, you are in violation of now several park rules. Number one, obviously, you’ve got a fire situation we need to deal with. Number two, well it’s not ranger season, partner, and these grounds are—
Griffin: [laughing] Partner?
Clint: I like this.
Griffin: Yeah alright, no, I’m into it.
Duck: My name is District Ranger Duck Newton, um [crosstalk]
[Crosstalk, unintelligible]
Griffin: The duck, er the door to the- you’re just having this conversation with the closed door. The door slides open as you start talking.
Justin: I thought he fired the shotgun through the door?
Griffin: It just kind of dented it. But she—
Justin: It’s a bad gun!
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Griffin: Yeah, she uh—
Clint: She must’ve- And they’d had to have been some blow back too.
Griffin: Yeah, she opens the door as you’re talking and sets down her shotgun, and actually like puts her hands up and then realises you’re not a cop and puts her arms down, but then she puts her hands back up again, she’s like, “I don’t? Okay,” and puts her hands back down like, “You’re not a cop, it’s probably okay.” Inside the RV is a young woman, probably about 20 years old. She’s wearing a tank top, she’s got a toboggan on with ear flaps, she uh, drinking a bottle of Yuengling, and when she sees that you’re not a cop but still, like an employee of the park, she kind of tries to scoot it out of your line of sight with her foot, and she is disarmed and has her shotgun down. She says uh:
Shotgun Person: [southern accent] Sorry, uh w-what’s uh, what’s your name?
Duck: My name is Duck Newton.
Griffin: She starts cracking up, laughing, like kind of slapping her leg. She’s still like obviously still kind of nervous but she- this has kind of cut the tension a little.
Shotgun Person: You’re kidding me? Duck?
Duck: [flatly] It’s a nickname.
Griffin: She says
Pigeon: Oh no no, my name is Pigeon! That’s, that’s crazy man. What are the odds?
Duck: Don’t that beat all? Uh, listen, we need to get this fire under control, this- this is a real danger to the, uh, to the park, and this is kind of a little bit of a dry season for us so we’ve got a sort of elevated risk, and we’re gonna need you to bring that down. Obviously, trying to shoot me with a shotgun, was a problem, but I don’t have the ability to arrest you or anything. What was um- what’s going on?
Griffin: She laughed at sort of the incident of both of you kind of having bird names, but she’s starting to look a little bit shaky again and she reaches down and shakily grabs the Yuengling and she’s like:
Pigeon: I know it’s against the rules, but if you had the kind of night I’ve been having, I don’t think you’d do any better.
Griffin: She takes a slug and she says:
Pigeon: I uh, I need to keep that fire going, because, I ran into something out in the woods. Me and my buddy, Pete, we ran out into something in the woods, and he’s still out there, somewhere. We were looking for mushrooms, and we got attacked, by some big motherfucker, some kind of like- it was a bear but I’ve seen bears, and this was like, this was like, several bears sort of all rolled up into one superbear.
Travis: He was wearing blue jeans!
[Clint laughs]
Pigeon: I built that fire to try to keep him away, but I know I was breaking the rules, but I was just kind of waiting for it to go off, before I go out and try to find my buddy again.
Duck: Listen, I like a story as much as anybody. What is- is it Friday night?
Pigeon: Yeah.
Duck: That’s right, right? There’ll be traffic from the high school football game, so I’m assuming [sighs], we got about 20, 30 minutes before the cops get here, honestly, their response time isn’t great. Why don’t you do away with the story, I’ve got a little time to kill. Why don’t you tell me what’s really going on here? Are you hiding from somebody? You messed up, with drugs? What’s the deal?
Griffin: So, uh, this would be a great time for Investigate a Mystery because you have kind of- or she has sort of stepped you into what is the mystery of this arc, and if you want to find out more details of the monster and what’s going on here, then you can sort of interview Pigeon by sort of doing this move.
Justin: Oh, wow, 12.
Griffin: Holy shit twelves are cool-
Travis: Her whole life is laid before you as if reading a book.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: There’s a way to, uh, when you level up you can improve your moves, so that there’s sort of an additional condition, where if you get a 12 you get like a bunch of great stuff, but right now, it’s just a big success. So for Investigate a Mystery, which is different from Read a Bad Situation, you get a three hold- no, you get two holds actually on a 10-plus and you get to ask some questions.
Justin: Okay, this is- this is a point of order here, previously when I was using holds, I was asking you a sort of omnipresent, omniscient narrator-
Griffin: Right.
Justin: Which it says I’m still asking the Keeper in Investigate a Mystery.
Griffin: It’s the same thing.
Justin: If I’m using an investigate a mystery’ am I getting answers through them as a conduit, but confident in this information is legit?
Griffin: It is in both things, Read a Bad Situation and Investigate a Mystery are both contextual. Read a Bad Situation, I will only divulge information based on what you can see, based on what you’re doing to read the situation. When you Investigate a Mystery if you’re talking to her, she’s not gonna be like, “Well the silver swords you need to kill the dragon…” like she’s only gonna tell you what she knows. It’s always conditional.
Justin: Okay, so, uh let’s see-
Griffin: Also- also, like a thing, like an important thing, um, there’s a lot of- there’s what’s called the Keeper Agenda that is sort of a facet of all of the Apocalypse games. And a big one is uh, and this is sort of an umbrella for a lot of this stuff, I uh- I am a fan of yours guys characters which means I’m not going to do anything intentionally to mislead you or put you in a situation where like if you- like if something was left unsaid, I punish you for that? And with that in mind, I will always tell you the truth in these situations, so you can take what you investigate here and the info you glean as gospel. Unless, there are characters who will be like liars, but then we’ll cross the bridge when we come to it. But what she tells you is, you know will be the truth. What you do to kind of rectify that for Duck to make it something he believes is up to you.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: So two hold, two questions.
Duck: So um, what sort of creature is it?
Griffin: She says uh:
Pigeon: I told you, it was some kind of bear? It was so dark and I dropped my flashlight somewhere back there but uh, it has kind of patchy fur like, I don’t know how to describe it, like patchwork fur? Like it almost looked like it, it almost like it had a horn coming out of its body, not out of his head, like a bear unicorn or something, but out of its shoulder? And um, that’s about all I saw. It was big, man, it was about eight- eight feet tall or so? It was a big nasty bastard.
Duck: Did you say a big nasty badger?
Pidgeon: Ba-Bastard. It might have been a big badger, I don’t know. It was dark.
Duck: Yeah, I was gonna say, I mean it’s not impossible. Uh, did you see which way it went?
Griffin: Is this your second question?
Justin: Uh yep, where did it go?
Griffin: She says- she points back into the woods sort of behind Lot 5. Um she says uh:
Pidgeon: It uh, sort of pursued me here to my camp but when it got to me, it sort of turned tail and ran away as soon as it got close to the camp. That’s why I built that fire. Yeah, it just turned tail and ran right back in there.
Griffin: And you can see as she’s describing this, there’s a path of sort of broken branches on the ground and some disrupted like piles of leaves, and in there, you actually also see sort of some droplets of what looks like black blood or some sort of black ooze, that you could follow as a trail because you asked this question and got this information back into the woods. She actually sees you notice some of this blood on the ground and she’s like:
Pigeon: Ah yeah, I did, uh, I did shoot it, which is probably also not okay, but like, my life was in danger, it was self-defense, but I’ll tell you bud, it didn’t seem to do much of anything. So um, I guess it’s not illegal if it doesn’t really hurt the animal.
Duck: Well, it’s obviously still illegal. I think both you and I know that.
Pigeon: Listen… I can’t- I’m kind of nervous about- I heard you call the cops earlier, I know you said they’re on their way. Is there any way you can kind of wave them off? I swear to God, I was attacked and everything I’ve done is sort of in response to that and I’m pretty freaked out right now and I really don’t wanna go to the pokey, which... is not what human beings call it, I’m just really nervous.
[Travis laughs]
Duck: Pigeon, what’s your last name Pigeon?
Griffin: I didn’t give Pigeon a last name.
Travis: Pigeon Pigeonson.
Justin: Well you can pick any fucking last name in the world, Griffin. Start yes-anding please.
Pigeon: Wilson, Pigeon Wilson.
Duck: Wilson. Are you- are you Vicky’s girl?
Pigeon: Yeah, that’s- that’s me. Vicky’s girl.
Duck: Ahh, alright. Listen, I can tell you’re pretty scared and you didn’t mean to uh take a shot at me. Honestly, I mind less about that than the fire. You know, some of these trees- look around you, some of these are 60 years old, can you imagine? Loose match, cigarette, 60 years old, just gone. [crosstalk] That’s what bothers—
Pigeon: Yeah no- That’d be horrible.
Duck: I’ll make you a deal. If you can promise me to never to start an open flame like this again and only occasionally taking shots at rangers with shotguns,[Clint laughs] then I think we can wave them off. They’re probably gonna have quite a few drunks to take care of anyway.
Clint: Friday night!
Duck: Friday night, yep, I hear you.
Griffin: She smiles, big smile. She actually runs up and gives you a big hug, she’s like:
Pigeon: Oh, Duck! Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I-I swear. I’m done with fire, I’m pretty much done with shooting at rangers. I just- I would say I’m relieved, but I’m still pretty worried about Pete. He’s my buddy, he’s still out there somewhere. We got separated while we were running away. Do you think you could try to see where he’s at? Try to find him for me?
Duck: Yeah. I’ll try and go for a look. No promises, it’s a big forest.
Pigeon: Okay. Um, are you uh, are you packin’ heat? ‘Cause I’m real worried now about the bear and you getting hurt by the bear. Are you strapped?
Duck: I’m not strapped, but I’m also not gonna engage. The problem I’m having, Pigeon. Hold on real quick. Come on back, that was a false alarm there I uh-
Police: [muffled, radio voice] There was a false gunshot? What? False gunshot? How does that work?
Duck: You know, I- It was a couple of kids playing with cherry bombs. I just- little over-active imagination.
Police: Those fucking millennials, man, I’m telling you.
Duck: I know, I hear that. I hear that. Alright, so you can wave the boys off, thank you.
Griffin: She-she leans into the RV and she pulls out a hunting rifle that she kind of hands to you and she’s like:
Pigeon: I know you don’t wanna engage but it might wanna engage with you. Are you sure you don’t wanna take…?
Duck: Pigeon, you brought a lot of guns out here, eh? [crosstalk] This a second gun business?
[Clint laughs]
Pigeon: No, this one’s Pete’s. This is his. We each brought one gun.
Duck: Alright well, I’ll hold onto it in case I run into Pete so we can get that back to him.
Travis: So you can kill Pete?
Duck: I’m gonna make a call to make sure that uh, Pete’s got all the proper paperwork for this but uh yeah, I’ll hold onto it for now if that’ll make you feel better. The problem I’m having, Pigeon, is about the biggest animal we have in these parts is the good ol’ ursus americanus, the black bear. That’s our state bear, you know that?
Pigeon: Yeah, everybody knows that, take West Virginia History, but uh-
Duck: Quick, state flower: Go!
Pigeon: The rhododendron. [crosstalk] but I’ll tell you, Duck, you’re wrong about that bud, but you’ve got something way bigger in these woods.
Duck: [enthused] Alright, alright!
{music 28:02-28:08}
Griffin: Aubrey, so the early days of a professional magician’s career are pretty difficult ones. Your gigs are almost inconceivably humble with crowds that don’t really pay attention, and venues that generally just don’t pay, and it’s on one of these days that we find you, Aubrey Little, the Lady Flame, on your grind. You’re doing a show on a small sort of temporary stage in the lobby of a resort in Snowshoe, West Virginia, which is pretty, pretty close by to Kepler. It’s about as prestigious as the last you know, dozen shows you’ve done. There’s a small gathering of guests sort of with nothing better to do, just sort of sitting around the lobby, kind of half watching. There’s a kid’s birthday party in the corner of the room that is just paying you no mind at all. It would almost be too insulting to do if the pay wasn’t decent and you need bus ticket money if you’re gonna line up your next gig. So Audrey Little- Aubrey Little-
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: What does your act look like?
Travis: Um, well Aubrey’s act is very- uh it’s sleight of hand, is what we’re looking at to-
Justin: But with fire.
Travis: Yeah so the flourishes and the misdirects are all centered around fire, but that more kind of the showier tricks. I mean basic stuff is, you know, your card tricks, your rings.
Griffin: Yeah, got it.
Travis: Um, you know, your basic rabbit out of a hat, hence Dr. Harris Bonkers.
Griffin: Like if you’re a fan of old school magic performance, these are the tricks that you’ve learned first, right? It’s not like you’re David Blaine like eating a bunch of snakes or and leeches or whatever and barfing them up and like, “Oh it’s new magic!” This is like, it sounds like you’re talking about that sort of old school shit but with fire.
Travis: Well, here’s the thing. Here’s the thing about magic and magic performances is like you have the basics, right? Where your sleight of hand, you know, “Look over here, here’s the ball, oh where’d the ball go?” is like, that’s the basic. And like it’s how you perform it, it’s your patter, it’s your flourishes. That’s what separates you, because really a lot of the building blocks are the same with every trick.
Griffin: I got you.
Travis: it’s what you add onto it, so Aubrey’s thing is very, um, you know, the flash, the literal flash of the fire, the sparks—
Griffin: Cool.
Travis: —the patter.
Griffin: Then let’s get started. I want Aubrey to- either like a few sections to start off with and I’m gonna fudge the rules a little bit, but I want Aubrey to go ahead and do her first trick of the night.
Travis: Okay.
Aubrey: Alright, now everybody? I want you to listen closely. Three thousand years ago, on the banks of the Nile, the priests used to believe that if someone believed hard enough and pushed their will to the brink they could conjure, from nothing, flame itself. I am that person. With the strength of my will alone, not only can I conjure flame from nothing, but I can manipulate that flame to become whatever I desire.
Travis: And she begins concentrating and has the concentrating face, as her hands move through the air, dancing dancing, the hands dance, and then she ignites a pile of metallic shavings that she has palmed to create a flash in an attempt to manifest a flower that she had up her other sleeve.
Griffin: Um, okay. By the way, what’s the background music, because you sort of painted a picture of her having sort of non-traditional magician aesthetic and I’m sort of wondering if that is also part of the act?
Travis: Yeah, so I would say that she has like a little, like, sound board that she carries with her that she plugs into a mini speaker, if you know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah, what’s it playing?
Travis: I would say it’s kind of like, imagine like a lot of the incidental music from Prince of Egypt.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: But added to it is like-
Griffin: But not like punk-punk-punk rock-
Travis: But added to it is like punk EDM.
Griffin: Okay but, fine, that’s a lot of fucking genres but I’m into it. So-
Travis: Listen, let me tell you, straight up, I would say the music background is the weakest point of her act.
Griffin: Sure. Um, so I’m fudging the rules a little here, because for this part I just want you to do a straight up or down roll, and based on what you decide- so if it’s something that is going to be sort of dextrous, like requires a lot of hand-eye coordination or something like that, I want you to roll plus Cool. But if it’s something where you’re trying to misdirect the audience, I want you to roll plus Charm.
Travis: No it’s misdirect. Um, so with that, I got a 10.
Griffin: Okay, I think with a 10, you crush it. You cause this burst of flames to shoot out of your hand and suddenly there is a flower in your other hand, and with that, and with a performance that steady, I think the audience is now sort of like paying attention. You actually get some scattered applause throughout the audience, which, you have done shows in like resort lobbies like this where you’ve not got any applause at all, so this is- this is awesome. The kids’ birthday party, a couple of the kids actually are sort of - their eye catches the flash of the fire and they start applauding too. And this one kid in the back yells out:
Kid: Hey! Do you do balloon animals?
Aubrey: I do not, but thank you for asking.
Griffin: Before you get to your second trick, you also notice some activity at the front door, as a large woman, like just this imposing figure wearing a tattered brown leather duster is helping out one the staff’s- one of the hotel staff, wheel in this ornately detailed wooden sculpture of an elk, into the lobby, on a- you know, on a pallet. You notice that in the back of the room. What is your second trick?
{{Travis|Aubrey: Now, before I continue, if I’m going to move forward with these amazing feats of will and skill, I’m going to need the help of a wise and venerable assistant.
Griffin: You see a couple of kids start raising their hands, like “Oh oh oh!”
Aubrey: Hold on just one moment, because now I am about to introduce to you the true amazing wonder of my act. Folks, I’m ready to present: Dr. Harris Bonkers! [someone feigns a crowd roar]
Travis: And she taps with her foot and a little puff of smoke from a mini pyrotechnics machine goes on, and with that, the sides of a box fall away, revealing Dr. Harris Bonkers, PhD.
Griffin: Um, I think maybe one of the kids is like:
Kid: A bunny!
Griffin: But everybody else doesn’t really know how to react to this [laughs]. I think that would count as a trick, by the way, so go ahead and roll plus charm on that.
Travis: Okay. Um, it was an eight.
Griffin: Yeah, okay. I think you just get that result. One of the kids is just like, “A bunny!” and the rest of the audience doesn’t really know how to react to that, as Dr. Harris Bonkers makes his appearance. And as this cloud of smoke like rolls up and dissipates you see through it and you see and the resort’s manager has made his way from behind the front desk and he’s like conversing with this like large imposing woman, sort of taking the statue off her hands and handing her an envelope, which she tucks into the pocket of her coat and now she’s just hanging out at the back of the room and sort of watching your act.
Aubrey: To you, he seems like just a bunny, but let me tell you: Dr. Harris Bonkers was once the greatest wizard who ever walked the face of the Earth! Until one day, he touched on something too powerful for him to control, it backfired, cursing him into this poor and lonely shape. But I am able to communicate with Dr. Harris Bonkers, and Dr. Harris Bonkers tells me that there’s someone here in the crowd who I need to bring up on stage. Someone here with something to tell me. You! In the back, in the ragged duster. Would you join us on stage please?
Griffin: This woman at the back of the room, uh sort of- kind of an older woman, you think? Like not older maybe, like mid-fifties or so? She kind of smiles and like shakes her head like, “No I’m good, thank you though.” She gestures over at one of the kids at the party like, “Why don’t you take one of them instead? I feel like they’d get a kick out of it.”
Aubrey: I see. A little trepidatious, afraid of what Dr. Harris Bonkers might know. Very well, if you’re afraid…
Griffin: She gets that you’re trying to goad her and she kind of chuckles again.
Aubrey: Very well. Let’s see, we need a volunteer. Who’s- lets see…
Griffin: There’s a kid in the birthday party who’s like wearing like a paper crown, who you take to be the birthday boy.
Aubrey: You! The little prince. Why don’t you join us here on stage?
Griffin: The kids are kind of like clapping, almost like they’re making fun of this little boy, who kind of like nervously, kind of almost sullenly walks up to the stage and hops up next to you and Dr. Harris Bonkers.
Aubrey: [whispers] Don’t worry kid, it’s gonna be fine. [normal voice] Now, what we are going to do here: he is going to- what’s your name son?
Randy: Randy…
Aubrey: Alright, Randy is going to communicate to Dr. Bonkers and then Dr. Bonkers is going to communicate to me. Are you ready Randy?
Randy: Yeah, I guess so.
Aubrey: Okay.
Travis: And so then she begins some very flourishy, like card shuffles, and offers to Randy.
Aubrey: Now Randy, I want you to pick a card, but don’t show it to me. I want you to show it to Dr. Bonkers.
Griffin: He picks a card, and holds it to his chest, looks at it.
Randy: You want me to show it to your bunny?
Aubrey: To Dr. Harris Bonkers, yes.
Randy: Alright.
Griffin: And he goes and sort of flashes it to Dr. Harris Bonkers. Is Dr. Harris Bonkers a magic rabbit? What would stop this rabbit from just like eating the card? He’s just well-trained?
Travis: He’s a very well-trained rabbit! He’s very smart for a rabbit.
Griffin: Alright, I got you. Alright, continue the trick, the illusion.
Aubrey: Now Randy, I don’t want you to put it back in the deck. That would be too simple. I want you to hold it in front of you. Don’t show it to me, but concentrate on it as hard as you can.
Griffin: He’s concentrating on the card.
Travis: And she puts her finger to the back of it, and snaps and the card ignites in flames.
Griffin: Roll plus Weird.
Travis: Okay, that’s a 10. I rolled an eight plus two.
Griffin: Okay, I’m trying to decide if that’s very good or very bad. I think following the rules of the game, I think it’s good, but it’s also powerful. You touch your finger to the back of the card, and what did you intend for it to happen?
Travis: The card, like flash paper, goes up.
Griffin: It actually, kind of, explodes in a big burst of flame. Okay, with that in mind, I think Randy sees like this fire is actually pretty big and scary, so he kind of drops the card and jumps off the stage, and Dr. Harris Bonkers also jumps out of the way, but this explosion- you’ve done this trick hundreds, thousands of times- this is not intended. The burst of flame is actually enormous and I think the people in the front row also kind of scoot their chairs back instinctively, and the fire doesn’t like stop, it’s not like a blast of fire, it kind of hangs in the air off your hand. And as you turn to look at your hand, like the fire spreads, and now the curtain that’s behind the stage also gets ignited a little bit. There’s some flags, some like little decorative pennants hanging from the ceiling that also catch ablaze, and suddenly the people in the audience are having to pay attention to you, they are kind of yelling and starting to turn and run kind of scared.
Travis: I want you to know, I’m gonna say, this is a professional magician who works with fire, hidden under the table is a fire extinguisher.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: She would not be without a fire extinguisher. She is doing tricks around kids—
Griffin: Yeah sure.
Travis: —with flames. So would that be Act Under Pressure?
Griffin: Uh yeah, I think Act Under Pressure. I think that there’s fire kind of starting to spread around the curtains and pennants and—
Travis: Well, that’s not good.
Griffin: [amused] What’d you get?
Travis: It’s a four plus zero.
Griffin: Oh boy. Well, mark experience.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Griffin: You really set that up for me. ‘Cause I didn’t even think to make you- okay, this is a good game. Uh, so when you act under pressure, and you fail, something goes very, very bad. Uhh, I get to make basically a hard move, and the hard move is that the fire just spreads, pretty quickly. Um, you get the feeling that is not spreading naturally it’s almost spread in response to you and the things that you’re doing, and now the whole back wall of the uh, of this lobby is kind of ablaze with sort of this one long curtain and it is all on fire, and you try to put it out with your fire extinguisher, but it’s just not effective enough. And I think the kids’ birthday party at the back of the room is now just clapping like up and down cheering, this is the best fucking thing they’ve ever seen. [Clint laughs] But some uh, some adults come and grab them and start to usher them out of the room. And you see that big- that imposing woman in the back of the room, kind of look curiously at you and then walk backwards out of the lobby as the fire alarms start blaring. The lobby’s on fire, what do you do?
Travis: Okay, she closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. And then another. And then another.
Griffin: She’s burned to death. No, okay-
Travis: No, she’s not. She’s breathing quietly, calming down, and then she acts.
Griffin: Alright, what are you doing?
Travis: First, I’m gonna scoop up Dr. Harris Bonkers.
Griffin: Yep.
Travis: And then I’m going to uh, you know, get the fuck off the stage.
Griffin: Uh yeah. I think the fire’s mostly behind you at this point so you have a pretty clear line to the exit.
Travis: Well I guess- here’s my question: is this the first time anything like this has ever happened to Aubrey?
Griffin: You tell me, dog.
Travis: I’m going to say no. I’m going to say—
Griffin: I will definitely say- I will definitely say it has never happened this powerfully before if it has happened before.
Travis: Yeah, I’m going to say little things like this happened a lot more when she was a kid. She has probably had like weird manifestations of this, and so if the fire is somehow springing from her and reacting to her, I’m going to see if she can, maybe, without really knowing what she’s doing, in calming down, see if she can get the fire to calm down?
Griffin: I wanna challenge that and say is that something Travis wants to do, or is that something that this actual person would do if they were in the middle of a burning building?
Travis: Well, that’s such a good question, because it really depends on what the history of this with her is, you know? If she has had to deal with little things like this happening before, but never on this scale… I think that if the fire is behind her, I’m gonna try it once. Because maybe she used to play more like a kid lighting matches—
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: With this power when she was a kid, but it hasn’t manifested since then. I’m gonna say she’s been able to turn on and off this fire before—
Griffin: All right.
Travis: So she’s gonna make one attempt at it.
Griffin: Alright, so you’re gonna use magic, which is a Weird roll.
Justin: What’s weird about it?
[someone snorts]
Griffin: I guess this would be “Do one thing that’s beyond human limitations,” is one of the things you can do with magic.
Travis: Yeah well, I also have moves.
Griffin: You have like your fire attack or whatever, but I don’t think-
Travis: Well, no no no, I have moves. So one is called Not My Fault, which plus one to act under pressure when you are dealing with the consequences of your own spellcasting.
Griffin: That’s definitely this.
Travis: Um. Yeah so- but if it’s Weird, I rolled an eight plus two so it’s a 10.
Griffin: Okay. I think with a plus 10, you contain the fire. You see it start to retreat off the edges of the curtain, that sort lines the back of this room, and sort of retreat off the ceiling a little bit where it had started to spread. It’s still definitely burning somewhat, but you get the sense that you have essentially like, saved this building. Um, I will also say that the fire and heat and smoke of this situation is now powerful enough that it’s becoming kind of unbearable to be in this place. But with your control, you controlled the fire, you almost spoke to the fire and made it calm, somewhat. You have saved this building from being completely destroyed, but if you stay here any longer it’s going to be bad for your health.
Aubrey: Lady Flame out!
Griffin: Okay.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: You step outside, and as you do, you see some folks on their cell phones, trying to get reception. Again, you’re in the US National Radio Quiet Zone, and so it’s kind of difficult to get signal here. The kids are still applauding you as you come outside. In the distance, down on the hill that you’re on, you can see the lights of a fire truck kick on and start speeding up the road, and behind them, you see another set of lights kick on, and these are the lights of a police vehicle, sort of following to race up to this scene. And you also see out of the corner of your eye, to your left, you see at the edge of the building, that woman. That woman wearing the leather duster, and she is kind of frantically motioning for you to come over to her as quickly as you can.
Travis: I do that.
Griffin: Okay, you move over to that woman and you turn the corner and you see her big four-wheel truck, that she’s got parked around the corner of the building and as you come around the corner, she has a sawed-off shotgun trained on you and she speaks quickly and she says:
Woman: Alright then, let’s hear it. What are you doing this far from the gate? Didn’t anybody tell you the rules? Just come on now, I know real magic when I see it, fess up. You thought you’d just go around blowing up ski lodges all willy-nilly like that?
Aubrey: I’m flattered. Um, I’m a magician, those were tricks, I wish I could tell you how... I did it, but as you know, magicians’ secrets. [nervous laugh] Um, but-
Woman: Alright, explain the trick how you made the fire retreat. By the way, the cops are gonna be here in a couple minutes. How’d you make that fire just disappear? I’m listening.
Aubrey: Uhh, fireproof curtains. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d be happy to talk to you more, in the truck, away from here, please.
Woman: Alright, well I’m heading to Kepler anyways.
Aubrey: Where?
Woman: Kepler?
Aubrey: Never heard of it.
Woman: Well, I think it’s where you belong. I’m just as confused as you are.
Griffin: She uh holsters her shotgun in a holster she has inside of her duster. She says:
Woman: Alright, hop in the truck. Let’s get the hell out of here.
Aubrey: Hold on, first?
Woman: Yeah?
Aubrey: I need you to apologize to Dr. Harris Bonkers for pointing a gun at him.
Woman: I’m very s- that’s your rabbit?
Aubrey: His name is Dr. Harris Bonkers [crosstalk]
Woman: [crosstalk] Dr. Harris Bonkers, I’m very sorry for pointing a gun at you. Cops are gonna be here in about 30 seconds. Let’s get the hell out of here.
Aubrey: Hold on. Dr. Harris Bonkers, do you forgive her? [pause] Okay, he forgives you, let’s go.
Woman: I know Dr. Harris’ name. What’s yours again?
Aubrey: It’s Aubrey, but you can call me the Lady Flame. Now, if you don’t mind, start the fucking car.
Griffin: She hops in the driver's seat as you hop in the passenger's seat, and turns the ignition. She says:
Woman: Alright Aubrey, it’s nice to meet you.
Griffin: And she extends her big hand and she says:
Mama: I’m Mama.
{Commercial break 48:45-54:41}
{Music plays until 54:46}
Griffin: Ned, the bell over the entrance to the Cryptonomica chimes as Janice, Kepler’s dedicated mail carrier, finishes her route. Uh, the Cryptonomica sits at the very entrance to Kepler, uh, just alongside the Greenbrier River, which is glistening in the mid-morning sun. Uh, and Janice strides towards you, Ned, and begins rummaging around in her bag, but instead, she first delivers a couple of pieces of mail to this room’s other inhabitant, who is Kirby. He’s here often enough that she knows just to bring his mail directly to here at his request.
Kirby’s in his late 20s, kind of sloppily dressed. He’s drinking an RC Cola and, uh, he’s typing feverishly into an old Macbook that he has at a sort of makeshift desk in, like, a corner of the Cryptonomica.
And he has it positioned, his desk, by your modem, which he comes by to sort of plug into, which is kind of the nature of an arrangement that we’ll get into later. And Janice finishes delivering the package and the mail to Kirby and then walks over to you, Ned, and pulls out the last few pieces of mail from her bag. It’s mostly just junk mail, but then she pulls out another piece of mail, in a large envelope, and she kind of reacts with surprise, and she says,
Janice: Oh, this one’s certified, Ned. Looks important, gonna need you to sign for this one.
Ned: Of course, uhh, Janice. Certified… is it sent to me? I mean, in my name?
Janice: [amused] Yeah, dude. Why do you think I’d deliver it to you otherwise?
Ned: Well, no. I mean, if it was sent to the business, you know. Uh, sure. Here, let me, let me sign!
Griffin: ‘Kay. You sign for it.
Ned: Edmund… Chicane!
Griffin: She’s already like—
Ned: —here you go!
Griffin: She tears off the stub off the end of the certified sort of part of the letter, and she hands you the rest of it, and she pops on her headphones, and heads out the door just with a wave. And you have this piece of certified mail.
Justin: Hmm!
Travis: And it’s haauunted!
Griffin: It’s haunted. A big ghost jumps out of it. No, you tear it open, and it’s an eviction notice! You have— it tells you that you are two months late on your rent for the Cryptonomica, and you have seven days to pay the last two months’ rent. And you feel this pang of, sort of like, anger, because this was definitely issued by somebody at City Hall who was, like, gleefully pursuing the opportunity to get rid of your establishment. Like we talked about in the setup episode, there’s this friction between, like, the cryptid industry side of town and the, like, quaint tourism industry side of town. You also kind of saw this letter coming, because visitors at the Cryptonomica have been kind of few and far between, and revenue has dwindled. And before we go any further, I wanna hear from you about what the Cryptonomica looks like. What’s— whatd’ya got in there?
Clint: Cryptonomica is really kinda divided up into two areas. There’s one main area that is open to the public, with a lot of glass cases and a lot of shelves, tables, mostly cases, I’d say it’s dominated by the glass cases. And there’s another room, a back room, that is similar to the front room, but maybe about a third of the size. And it has things in it too, but that’s not open to the general public. There—
Travis: Can I ask you a question, Dad?
Clint: Yeah.
Travis: Is it like a museum, or like a shop?
Clint: [sighs] I think it… I think it’s like… a shop.
Griffin: I mean, every museum has a shop in it.
Travis: Yeah but I mean, is it like a gift shop/touristy thing or is it like, “Look on these wonders!”
Clint: I think Ned portrays it that way, but it’s, you know, every one of these wonders can be bought.
[Justin laughs]
Travis: Ahh, gotcha gotcha gotcha.
Clint: These wonders, one-of-a-kind, amazing artifacts, and mystic tomes, whatever, can all be purchased for a—
Griffin: The right price.
Clint: —ridiculous fee. And there are like um [laughs] spinners with pamphlets in it.
Griffin: I thought you were gonna say fidget spinners.
Travis: Yeah, I thought so too.
Clint: No. No, that’s—
Travis: With like Bigfoot’s face on ‘em.
Clint: And he’s got a lot of um, a lot of books. Uh you know, every cryptid you can imagine: Mothman, and uh the Jersey Devil, and Nessie, and some that are kind of dedicated to uh, to some of the local cryptids that are rumoured to be rumbling about. But Ned is gonna portray them to the public as amazing wonders, one of a lifetime items that can pierce through the veil of ignorance and enlighten everyone!
Griffin: But Ned doesn’t necessarily believe any of that?
Clint: Oh God [chuckles], hell no.
Griffin: Okay, um-
Clint: [laughs] He doesn’t believe in any of it.
Griffin: Also in this room, as I talked about earlier, is a corner where Kirby is working at a desk, and he sees you open this letter, he stands up from the desk, walks over to a vending machine in the corner, and pops in a couple quarters and he grabs a fresh RC Cola and he motions to you Ned like, “You want one?”
Ned: Ah no thank you! Friend Kirby, I’d much rather you get back to finishing whatever you’re doing so you can get the hell out of my shop.
Griffin: He kind of chuckles-
Ned: Museum! My museum!
Griffin: He kind of chuckles and he goes and he sets the can of soda down on his desk and he says um:
Kirby: Well, what’d you get, Ned?
Ned: I received a communiqué from the local bureaucracy, Kirby, and apparently they would like me to vacate the premises or pay them the exorbitant fees that they demand.
Griffin: He kinda like puts his head in his hands and sort of rubs his temples for a second, he’s like:
Kirby: You got an eviction notice, Ned? You gotta fix this, I like working in here, with you, it’s a good arrangement, anything you can do to drum up some-
Ned: Yes let’s talk about that arrangement, Kirby. What exactly do you do around here? What do you contribute to my wellbeing.
Kirby: Well, you know. I’m an income generator, Ned. You- you know how this works.
Griffin: You- I’ll explain cause this is, like, a thing you would know. This is not like- I’m introducing this to the game, but this is something Ned would know. Kirby runs a local cryptid zine, called the Lamplighter, and he writes about stuff, it’s like a one-page weekly, where he writes about cryptid activity in Kepler. And its circulation- I mean he puts it up in, you know, roadside restaurants and gets it out to a couple establishments outside of town to bring in some folks. But your arrangement is such that he writes about cryptids, and then people, if they get interested in it, they come here, to the Cryptonomica. Which is I think something Kirby had to give you the hard sell on, but it has worked in the past. Um-
Clint: Apparently not well enough!
Griffin: Yeah, things are definitely slow. He says:
Kirby: You’re gonna have to drum up some cash, Ned. Can you- Can you just-
Griffin: He starts looking around the Cryptonomica, he’s like:
Kirby: Can’t you just hawk some of this old stuff? I’m bettin’ some [crosstalk] weirdos out there would pay a pretty penny for it.
Ned: [crosstalk] Hmm...
Griffin: And while he’s saying that he’s eyeballing one exhibit you’ve got in particular, it’s like a strange looking weapon mounted in a display case on the wall.
Ned: You know, I bought all this stuff on ebay, so I’m not sure there’s a lot of resale. Perhaps back in my private stock… Yes, I-I think perhaps I may have to part with some of my extremely precious items in the back room.
Griffin: He says-
Ned: I know, I know you’ve never been in it. I know you don’t know what I’m talking about, but um…
Kirby: Oh, I go back there all the time.
[pause]
Ned: Oh… You do?!
Kirby: Yeah man! I mean, I’m a journalist. I gotta know- I gotta know the truth of the matter. I gotta know what’s going on.
Ned: Yeah… I may have to have that key back, um.
Griffin: [laughs] He says:
Kirby: Listen, you- you might not need to sell anything, we could just go do the usual.
Griffin: He says:
Kirby: In fact it seems like you’re hurtin’.
Griffin: He walks over to his desk and says:
Kirby: I think maybe it’s time we pull out the big guns. I- I think it’s time for a new exhibit.
Griffin: And he turns his laptop around, he spins it to face you and you can see what’s on the screen, it’s the front page of the next issue of the Lamplighter. And you see a headline in a staggeringly large font just below the masthead which reads “Bigfoot! Hiding Out in Kepler?”
And Kirby says,
Kirby: I know it’s pretty mainstream, but folks are just crazy about Bigfoot. You could become a destination for Bigfoot activity and put the Cryptonomica on the map!
Ned: Well, um… Kirby, I think the… seven people who’ll actually read that might be extremely interested. Okay, I think I can probably dust off some of the Bigfoot stuff and set it up in a new display.
Griffin: He says,
Kirby: I don’t know about your old Bigfoot stuff though, I’m talking about a new exhibit, Ned. Somethin- Somethin’ that is gonna bring in folks who’ve already been here and make this place the Bigfoot capital of the world!
Ned: Well, that’s-that’s fine, Kirby, but I think you’re forgetting is that we have to have stuff from the real Bigfoot, and since there is no real Bigfoot then there’s no… stuff from the real Bigfoot, so what do you suggest I make a display about?
Griffin: He says,
Kirby: I mean, come on, man! You know-You know the deal! You gotta take matters into your own, perhaps, costume-wearing hands sometimes.
Griffin: And he winks. He’s like,
Kirby: Listen, we both know that Bigfoot is bullshit, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Get out in the woods, take some blurry fuckin’ pictures! I don’t know! Whatever people usually do to make Bigfoot stuff happen. But you do that and this place is gonna pop off, I’m tellin’ you.
Ned: You know… I do have that Wookie costume from last Halloween…
[someone claps]
Ned: And it’s obviously a slight welp of a child like you, but you can take shitty pictures, can’t you?
Griffin: He’s like,
Kirby: I’m on a tight deadline for the next issue, but um… I think that Wookie costume would look great on you! You go out there, time- set a timer, on your phone, I can show you how to do it, I know you have trouble with some of your phone’s more advanced functions, but I think that’s gonna be great. And lemme tell you, Ned, personally speaking, I cannot wait to see these photos. These are going to be some choice images, my man.
Ned: Alright! I’ll do it, will you keep an eye on the shop?
Griffin: He says—
Ned: The museum! The museum.
Griffin: He says,
Kirby: Yeah, I’ll do it, I dunno how late you’re plannin’ on bein’, but I can close up if need be. [sarcastically] Lemme tell ya, I dunno how I’m gonna keep up with this rush of customers, though, oh my god! You gotta remind me of how everything works ‘cause it’s gonna get so frantic in here with all the customers!
Ned: [laughs] Kiss my ass, Kirby.
Griffin: And Kirby laughs as he cracks open his- that RC Cola, and he sits back down at his desk and starts working on the next Lamplighter as Ned, you start planning your next grift! You are going to bring Bigfoot to Kepler!

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone...
Calvin Owens: I saw the pool that I've swum in every day, last night it came alive. Was that real? Do monsters really exist here?
Barclay: It knows where you live now. I gotta close down the hot springs until we slay this thing, and the folks here, they need the springs to live.
Ned: And I want you to enchant this Nerf gun that I acquired. It's a very historical piece, very, very sought after.
Heathcliff: You are full of Sylvain's power.
Aubrey: I had a big meal when I got here.
Heathcliff: No that's— heh. I don't know how you are so infused if you were born on Earth, but that is what I see. I can see it as plain as the stars in the sky.
Barclay: It is of the utmost importance that nobody else gets clued in, okay?
Ned: My friend, Discretion is my middle name.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Griffin: It is finally the following morning. The longest day in literary history has been concluded. We almost lived that one out in fuckin’ real time. [Clint chuckles] But it’s the following morning and the three of you have regrouped at Amnesty Lodge. It is a nice day outside but the scene in here seems kind of, uh, a little bit bleaker than you’re used to seeing here at Amnesty Lodge. Usually this is a warm place of gathering and kindness, but right now there's just a few people in the lobby. You see Jake Coolice and Dani sitting at a table in the dining area, and they're both just kinda sittin’ there, head in hands, looking just kind of— just wiped out. You hear Barclay rustlin’ around in the kitchen but nobody seems to be here. It seems almost like there's a pall cast over the lobby as you enter in. Barclay comes out and hands some tea to Dani and to Jake Coolice, who kinda half heartedly accept it and just sorta set it down on the table without drinking it. So Barclay walks over to the three of you and says:
Barclay: So, uh, how'd it go last night?
Aubrey: Well, um, we went to Sylvain. Did you know that?
Barclay: Yeah, yeah I knew that.
Ned: And all we got were these crummy t-shirts!
Duck: Yeah, we did buy a lot of t-shirts.
Ned: Yeah.
Barclay: Maybe don't let Agent Stern see you wearing t-shirts that say, “Hey, I just visited another world full of monsters and magic.” Maybe take those off before he wakes up. [crosstalk] That's maybe—
Duck: It's not written in— it's not written in Arabic characters, that wouldn't make any sense. [Aubrey: Yeah] [crosstalk] So, I doubt he could read the—
Barclay: That is totally fair. Cool, maybe it's just a neat, y’know, skateboard brand.
Duck: [chuckling] It's just a cool design. They told me it says “courage”.
Clint: [crosstalk] It— do— [chuckles]
Barclay: [crosstalk] Very nice.
Duck: So I just went with it.
Clint: Do we see Agent Double O Downer anywhere? Is he [crosstalk] out here?
Griffin: No, it's fairly early in the morning. You do not see him and assume he is in his quarters right now asleep.
Ned: Why is everybody bummed out, Barclay?
Griffin: He sighs and looks back at Dani and Jake and he turns back to you and he says:
Barclay: I had to shut the pump off that feeds the hot springs yesterday after the attack. We can't have that monster showin’ up here again and so nobody’s been in the hot springs for, y’know, about twelve hours now and folks are starting to get a little bit agitated. It's kind of what happens when you cut off a Sylvan from a life source like that. So I don't where you all are in your investigation, but we need to get this thing down and we need to get it down real fast, cus’ things could get very ugly around here real quick.
Duck: Barclay, in your estimation, how long we got?
Barclay: Another day or so and we're gonna start losing the stuff that we know and love about our friends Dani and Jake and Moira and the whole team here. So, as quick as possible would be better.
Ned: What do you mean “losing stuff”? Are they gonna start dyin’!?
Barclay: [sigh] Eventually, but before that happens they're gonna start going a little bit… well, I guess, feral [pronounced feeral] is the word.
Aubrey: And then, after that, they'll go feral.
Ned: And then they're gonna go ferrel.
Barclay: [sarcastic] Yeah, they're gonna turn into Pharrell and then they're gonna get the big hats. No, this is not a joke, this is really serious stuff.
Travis: I just wanna apologize to everybody listening, because I accidentally just did Magnus’ character voice there.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Oh yeah, I didn't even notice.
Travis: That probably was very confusing for everyone.
Justin: And for pedantry. Y’know, that’s what really hurts. [Clint chuckles] That’s [Travis: Yeah.] intervening for pedantry.
[Clint continues chuckling]
Griffin: Barclay says,
Barclay: So do you all think you have enough on this elemental?
Aubrey: Well, it kind of sounds like it’s past the point of worrying if we have enough, right Barclay? Like, we do or we don't but it's time to fight.
Barclay: We need to get the springs running again, but I don't want you all to run into a battle unprepared. I don't want you all to get hurt or worse.
Ned: You're right, no hurting.
Duck: It sounds like our only option then is to not go into it unprepared, eh? What do we— uh, what do we know?
Barclay: Let’s take this into Mama’s office, I don't want Stern walking in here and, uh—
Ned: Is she not back yet!?
Barclay: There was a part of me that was hoping that she would show up at that last minute. She'd walk through the door right when the hunt was about to begin and help save the day. I can't imagine doin’ this without her, I've never had to try before, but I don't think that's gonna happen. So I think it's just us on this one.
Aubrey: Have we, like, called around to— not that I think this is the case, but, like, local hospitals or police stations or have we checked around on Mama?
Griffin: He sighs again and he says:
Barclay: I can't bring myself to do it, Aubrey. I know that's cowardly of me but I'd rather hold out hope than go lookin’ for bad news.
Aubrey: [dejected] Yeah… I get that.
Barclay: Come on, uh, head into Mama’s office, I’ll bring you all some tea.
Griffin: And he motions towards Mama’s office.
Justin: Okay.
Clint: In we go!
Justin: In we go.
Griffin: And he comes in with tea and he knows your tea preference at this point. He knows you all enough to know how you like it. I can't— I'm not going to make pretend what that is, but just [crosstalk] imagine.
Clint: Arnold Palmer— Arnold Palmer iced tea, that's for me.
Griffin: Okay, he brings you a virgin Arnold?
Clint: Probably.
Justin: It's the only kind there is.
Clint: No, wait, no!
Travis: But an Arnold—
Griffin: It's like fuckin’ seven in the morning.
Travis: An Arnold Palmer is just tea and lemonade, you guys.
Griffin: Oh, I thought—
Clint: Aw, okay. I guess it is a virgin.
Travis: There's no booze in a Arnold Palmer.
Justin: I mean, sometimes there is. Arnold Palmer loves to party.
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Griffin: That's true, yeah.
Justin: [chuckles] Sometimes there is booze in an Arnold.
[Laughter]
Griffin: He walks over to the desk and you all now seated at this large table in the center of the room. He rolls out a big map of Kepler, which I still need to generate. Hey, listeners! If you know of any good software to make a nice lookin’ map of, like—
Travis: It's called a pad of paper, Griffin.
Griffin: Yeah, that's gonna end up lookin’ like reaaaal shit. Um, but he rolls out a map of Kepler and walks over to the desk. And he pops it open and he pulls out Thacker’s very, very old laptop, which he sets up on the desk. And he says:
Barclay: Okay, so… what do we know? Obviously, this thing can control water and kinda take different forms as long as it's in the water. What else?
Aubrey: It seems aggressive, um, at least as far as once it tangles with somebody, it kinda continues to seek them out, right?
Griffin: He types all that in and kinda gets frustrated, but then you hear a MacBook error noise and then he clicks it away and keeps typing. And he says:
Barclay: Yeah, it seems aggressive. I mean, honestly, it sucks for us because we can't run the springs but it's gonna help us get into the final battle with this thing. We're not gonna have to hunt it down, it's hunting us. We can maybe use that as an advantage.
Ned: So we’re the bait?
Aubrey: Seems like.
Duck: Perhaps. It seems like we— it might be to our advantage at this point. I mean, we can pick a spot and at least determine where we wanna fight it, which might be somethin’.
Aubrey: Well, and, going off what we know, if we can get it there and then isolate it from any other source of water, at the very least we might be able to contain it.
Barclay: Yeah, you mentioned that before and I think that's gonna be our best chance. It seems to move through connected water channels and, if we can disconnect it from that after gettin’ it where we want it, we're gonna be able to keep this thing from takin’ off as soon as it feels threatened.
Duck: I've been working on trying to come up with some ideas for where we might be able to make our stand. Uh, but I'm not real happy with the list, so I'd rather just kinda keep it to myself, if that's...
Barclay: Oh, there's no such thing as a bad idea, just bad people.
Aubrey: I don't think that— [Duck: What?] Barclay, I don't think that's the saying.
Ned: He's Sylvan, he doesn't [crosstalk] know.
Barclay: [crosstalk] I'm still figuring out the idioms.
Duck: I've written on this list here, but I'd rather not read them. I'm just gonna keep them to myself, if that's okay.
Aubrey: No, c’mon.
Ned: Kinda slows down the ol’ planning process there, buddy.
Duck: I know, I know, but I've got them here on this list in my hand, and I just don't wanna read— read them. Read the list.
Ned: Well, I’ll read them for you if you want!
[Clint laughs]
Duck: Ah crap!
Ned: Let me have the paper, Duck, and I'll read them so you're not ashamed. [pause] Ah, lets see, first:
[Griffin laughs]
Ned: Is that the fir— this is the first one— this is— are these in priority?
Duck: I don’t— I don't— I just…
Ned: A big desert. That's—
Duck: Yeah, ok, I thought—
Ned: Or is— ah, wait, wait, wait, unless it’s supposed to be dessert? [crosstalk] Is it a big dessert?
Duck: [crosstalk] No, dessert has two— dessert’s super sweet, so it’s got two S’s.
Ned: Ok, so your first idea is a big desert.
Duck: A big desert.
Ned: You have a back up to the big desert plan: a dehumidifier store!
Duck: Ok, listen, I don’t even know if that exists. I was— it was pretty late, when I was cooking these up, ok? And I— I honestly lost the plot pretty quickly after that, I don’t even remember what the third one I wrote was. So please don’t give me any crap about it, all right, guys?
Ned: Uhh, sure! Big lake! Hmm!
Duck: Ok, listen, I was— I wasn’t really thinking at that point, ok? [crosstalk] I was tired, and it came to me—
Ned: [crosstalk] No, no! You went to a lot of trouble, I’m very proud of you.
Duck: All right. That’s the best I’ve got, so— desert, I can rule that one out pretty quickly. We— there’s not one of those for many miles. That would be challenging, I would say, at best. Dehumidifier store is promising—
Barclay: Yeah, it’s got something. You’ve got something.
Duck: Do you guys feel good about— ‘cause you can kinda see how we switch those motherfuckers on, [Barclay: Yeah…] and now it’s time to party.
Ned: That’s really niche-market in there.
Duck: It’s so niche. In this market, especially, I feel like— I don’t think I’ve seen a dehumidifier store.
Barclay: Well, there’s Dave’s Dehumidifier Depot down on Apricot Street.
[Clint laughing]
Duck: Okay, that is—
Aubrey: Yeah, but they don’t open until 11 on weekdays.
Duck: [laughing] Yeah, and those— and Dave’s prices are real jacked up, guys, if we break one of those things, we’re gonna be owing him out the wazoo, and I don’t think we want that.
[laughter]
Ned: There is the big lake, it says big lake.
Duck: [crosstalk] Yeah, lake’s a bad one—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Wait, wait, wait, wait— Duck? Is there anywhere in your forest knowledge, I guess, anywhere where there’s, like, a dammed off section of anything, or anything where, like, a lock or somewhere we could lure and then close, you know— out in the open, away from people?
Duck: There’s the Morgantown Lock and Dam, it’s on the Monongahela up in Morgantown, obviously.
Griffin: Barclay says,
Barclay: A lock might not be a bad idea, but Morgantown’s way outside of the one mile perimeter. Is there anything on the Green Briar that is within the perimeter?
Griffin: I am saying, as the Keeper of this game, one thing that I want to do more of is have you guys flesh out the world of Kepler. I think that that was sort of one of my original goals when we started playing this game that I have not been an especially great steward of. If this is where y’all want this fight to take place, I think it could be fucking killer, and I think it’s something we should do.
Ned: You know, there’s the Kepler [Pay?] Lake. The Kepler [Pay] Lake, right on the outside outskirts of town, where they have a controlled water source where, you know, when they need to increase the water supply, they open it up, and then they close it off when they don’t need it anymore.
Duck: So maybe I’m just dense, guys, but how does this help us?
Aubrey: If we can, one, pinpoint it, and two, close it off from another source, so if we have something where we can have it open to get it there, and then close it off once it’s in, at the very least it won’t be able to spread. We could at least open back up the spring here, even if we’re not able to stop it, we’ll at least trap it.
Barclay: The biggest problem we’ve run into is that this thing turns tail and runs every time y’all get a shot off on it. And we’re not going to be able to take it down that way, and that’s why we’ve got to contain it. I think the [Pay] Lake sounds good, I think the lock and dam sounds good, if there’s one on the Green Briar close enough.
Aubrey: Ooh! Is there a water treatment plant in Kepler?
Barclay: Yeah, of course.
Aubrey: That might be...good.
Duck: Or very bad. That is connected [Aubrey: Yeah.] to all of the water in Kepler.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Admittedly, yeah, yeah, yeah, but—
Duck: I mean, I would love it if we were fighting it and it was all purified, I would love that, if it was drinkable— wait a minute. You think I could drink the whole thing?
Barclay: Aaaahhhh, no.
Aubrey: No.
Barclay: No.
Aubrey: No. But with the— you know the water treatment, it’s got the arms sweeping through it? That might mess its shit up, I don’t know.
Griffin: Barclay says,
Barclay: I think one of these three ideas could work. The Pay Lake, the water treatment plant, they probably have a way to shut down the city water supply, in case, you know, some pizzn gets out. Or—
Duck: [laughing] What did you say?
Barclay: Pizzn? Or— it’s a new sort of dialect that I’ve picked up while living here in Kepler. Or we could do the lock and dam, it’s just— which one of them do you think is going to give us the best shot here?
Aubrey: Well, so here’s my concern: I know we talked about the lake, but that’s so much material [crosstalk] for it to use.
Barclay: It’s a lot of water.
Aubrey: And I feel like a water treatment, if we can get it into one of the big round reservoirs, it’s not as large as a lake, or a lock and a dam, you know what I mean? It feels like the more we are in control of it, the more material there is for us vs. it, so being able to walk on walkways over the water and stuff like that is going to benefit us.
Ned: Did you happen to see— Aubrey, you probably didn’t, because you weren’t here. Duck, maybe you remember this—
Aubrey: I live here now!
Ned: The short promotional video that the Kepler Junior Chamber of Commerce came up with on, you know, all the wonderful things about Kepler, trying to bring tourism in, and how Kepler has the most water slide parks per capita of any town in West Virginia?
Duck: Yeah, I remember they tried to get that motto going, “The Slippery City.” They [crosstalk] tried to get a nickname going—
Ned: [crosstalk] Yeah!
Aubrey: [crosstalk] I actually have heard that!
Ned: Yeah.
Duck: The Slippery City. I still have a magnet somewhere, I think.
Aubrey: Slide On In to Kepler, they said!
Duck: The Slippery City.
Ned: But— most of them have closed, but the one, aahh— and I don’t remember the name— Duck, what was it’s— the, the name of the one that’s still open—
Duck: The Chute and Scoot?
Ned: Chute and Scoot?
Aubrey: Wet Willy’s?
Duck: No, no, no, that’s closed—
Ned: Slurp and Squirt?
Duck: Wet Willy’s closed, the Slurp and Squirt—
Griffin: [pained] The Slurp and Squirt? This is Griffin.
[Justin laughing]
Ned: The Slurp and Squirt was—
Duck: The Slurp and Squirt, they actually boarded that up for some health code violations—
Aubrey: Yeah, I think they blew it up, if I remember, [Griffin laughing] they set charges around it and exploded it.
Ned: And it was a good— and a good choice. A good choice, yeah. [Duck: Yeah.] But I know there’s one that’s still open—
Aubrey: Slides ‘N Stuff?
Ned: Slides and Stuff, there was an ampersand in there somewhere…
Aubrey: No, no, sorry, I didn’t want to confuse you. Not Slides and Stuff, that’s a different park. Slides ‘N Stuff is the one on the west side.
Barclay: [crosstalk] It’s really weird how they—
Ned: [crosstalk] Oh, on the west side. All right.
Duck: What about Kevin Costner Presents: Water World, the Wet Park? I re— that one, is that still open? Is Kevin Costner Presents: Water World, the Wet Park still open?
Aubrey: There’s also WTR [pronounced “Water”], that’s just spelled W-T-R, the really, like, bougie one?
Duck: That was the bougie one, yeah.
Barclay: What are we talking about here, gang?
Duck: I’m trying to remember, we had so many water parks in Kepler—
Ned: Well I’m saying, if we lure one— and we don’t have to do much luring, because they’re— it’s after our ass, [Aubrey: Yeah.] get it there, shut off the water, it can’t get away, and maybe grab a corn dog while we’re there!
Duck: You mean H2-Woah, That Was Fun!
Clint: [clapping] That was it! H2-Woah! That’s the name of it!
Travis: That’s the one.
Aubrey: That’s— oh, that’s the one with the water slide, the downward spiral.
Ned: Yeah!
Duck: Yeah, H2-Woah, That Was Fun! is still open, and it’s mainly targeted at kids, but they do have some slides and stuff there, maybe?
Ned: It’s not very large, [Duck: No.] I mean, it’s got a couple of things, it might be— might be manageable, might be workable.
Griffin: Barclay says,
Barclay: Ok, hold on, let me see if I can even get Google to work on this thing.
Griffin: And he types into the computer and says—
Justin: He has to type http, colon, forward slash, forward slash.
Griffin: He says,
Barclay: Ok, it looks like H2-Woah closes tonight—
Duck: H2-Woah, That Was Fun!
Barclay: H2-Woah, That Was Fun!, the water park, yeah, that’s the full name of it. Are y’all sure about this?
Aubrey: No, but—
Duck: Here’s what I’m thinking. Lots of opportunities for quick egress. ‘Cause you get on some of those slides and you’re just gone, the thing will never catch you. So we got some opportunities there. It’s also isolated. H2-Woah is out there where they were trying to get that whole business park started, do you remember? What was it called—
Griffin: Jesus, is this whole episode going to be naming—
Duck: No, it was like Hyper Ridge, that’s what it was, shit. Hyper Ridge, they were trying to get going, they were going to have, like, a Taco Bell, and a Bob Evans and a bunch of stuff out there—
Ned: Ziplines, there were ziplines—
Duck: Yeah. That’s how a business park works—
Ned: [crosstalk] Skating rinks—
Duck: [crosstalk] Good improvis— yeah. And the only thing they got moving there was H2-Woah, That Was Fun! So I think we’re going to be isolated out there, which is great. I don’t know— here’s my question. Is there maybe a way to shut off access, once it’s in the park itself, that we could shut down the lines to the public? I mean, do any of you guys have connections in Public Works, or anything? Or— I guess—
Aubrey: I mean, you would be the one I would look to—
Duck: I just remembered my many connections in Public Works.
[Clint and Griffin laughing]
Aubrey: Yeah.
Duck: I didn’t know if you guys had any closer ones—
Ned: Was that many connections, or mini connections?
Duck: No, I me— several, several different— I had one guy down there, what was his name? [laughing] Used to always help me out with the—
Aubrey: Wet Willy?
Duck: Wet Willy, or Mr. Slooper— Mr. Slooper, that was the one. He was my third grade teacher. Mr. Slooper, in— and now he works for the Water Department and Sanitation. So I could maybe ask him if there’s some way to shut down access.
Ned: You know, I believe he’s the super. I believe he’s the super down there.
Duck: Mr. Slooper the Super. That is him, yeah, he’s the one.
Aubrey: But don’t let him ask too many questions, ‘cause he’s a real snooper.
Ned: Yeah.
Duck: Yeah. Mr. Slooper, the Snooper Sloo— [laughs]
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: This show has gone wildly off the rails.
Aubrey: And you know his favourite movie, Looper!
Barclay: Yeah, sure.
Duck: His favourite movie is Without a Paddle.
Aubrey: Without a Paddle is his favourite movie.
Duck: Without a Paddle is his favourite movie.
Barclay: All right. It seems like we’ve got a plan coming together. Let me suggest—
Aubrey: [high pitched] Do we?
Ned: Does it really?
Duck: Does it? Does it? Huh.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Barclay is so forgiving.
Duck: You’ve got a real optimistic streak there, Barclay, [crosstalk] I like that about you.
Ned: [crosstalk] Pull it together, Barclay! Pull it together!
Griffin: He says,
Barclay: I think the park looks good. I think we can maybe find a way to shut it down. Duck, why don’t you go talk to your connection down at Public Works, like, now, and see what you can find out about shutting off water to the park—
Aubrey: Maybe butter him up with a blu-ray copy of Without a Paddle.
Barclay: Yeah, whatever it takes. We need somebody to actually go to the park, maybe scout it out, get an idea of where the best place to actually fight this thing inside the park is going to be. One problem I see us running into, though, is, I don’t think it’s a good idea to go around this water park before it’s time for the trap to be sprung. This thing’s following us, it’s smart. And so if we go there, and it sees us getting ready to fight it, then it’s not going to show up tonight. So we need a third person to go somewhere else and distract it while we’re doing the other two things.
Aubrey: You know, we could sweeten the pot even more and see if Calvin’s free, and maybe Ned and Calvin can go around town and stay on the move, and— I mean, I hate to make you moving bait twice in a row here, Ned, but you are the one with the car.
Ned: [strained] Dammit. I knew buying that car was a mistake. All right, yeah, that sounds like a fine plan.
Griffin: Barclay says,
Barclay: Do you think it’s such a good idea to put that kid in danger again? [crosstalk] He’s already been through a lot—
Aubrey: He’s in danger already, Barclay. Wherever he is, he’s in danger.
Duck: At least this way he’ll be with us, some battle-tested monster hunters. [snorts] Sorry, I tried to say that without laughing, I couldn’t quite get through it. It’s better than nothing, right? We’ve got magic weapons and shit.
Barclay: Yeah, I guess it’s better to keep him close, just— he might start asking questions. Ned, are you going to be able to sort of, I guess, lie, when he sees this thing?
Ned: I actually have an idea.
Aubrey: Don’t kill him.
Ned: All right, then I have another idea. I have a different idea. Yes, I think I have an idea that will work, that’ll convince Calvin to come along on this joy ride with me. Trust me.
Griffin: Barclay shuts the laptop and he says,
Barclay: All right. Aubrey, I’ll go with you to scout out the park. Ned, you’re going to pick up Calvin, and good luck sort of talking his parents into that one, and go somewhere with, I guess, lots of water, and get this thing’s attention. And Duck, you go talk to your contacts down in Public Works. How does— I think we— hey, it’s a plan! We did it without Mama! We can do this, we got this! We got this?
Ned: [uncertainty] We got this!
Aubrey: [uncertainty] Sure?
Duck: I guess.
Aubrey: But, ok, we’ve got that, we know where we’re going to lead it— how in the hell are we going to kill this thing?
Barclay: Well, Aubrey, we’re gonna figure that out when we get to the park and scout it out.
Ned: Yeah, Aubrey, we’re like Whose Line Is It Anyway. We’re the king and queen and another king of improv.
{Amnesty Theme begins to play}
Griffin: I think we’ve definitively proven that’s not true in this episode.
[laughter]
{Amnesty Theme fades out}
Griffin: Ned, you pull up in front of the house of Calvin Owens. Uh, he left his contact information with you all when he came to visit Amnesty Lodge to report the attack at the pool a couple of nights ago. You arrive at his house, it's a nice looking place— it's one of the nicer looking houses down on Riverside. It's not quite as fancy as the austentatious ski chalets up on cliff side, but it's a nice little two story house painted blue. And you pull up in your— what's your car again?
Clint: It's a 1958 Lincoln Continental.
Griffin: Lincoln Continental, yes.
Clint: The Mark III. The— the ragtop.
Griffin: I assume you've gotten the headlight repaired from where you smashed it into the gate in the previous adventure at this point. I don't know if it would be street legal, otherwise.
Clint: Ned has to take care of his baby. So…
Griffin: Yeah, sure. You arrive in front of the house and, uh, what's your approach here?
Clint: Is it near the river?
Griffin: Uh, it is— I don't know, it's about a couple blocks away. You got riverview, but you don't got, like, an attached. There's no pier [Clint: Okay.] or anything.
Clint: Alright, what's my approach gonna be?
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: Dishonesty.
Travis: Well, yeah.
Clint: Yeah, the—
Travis: Yeah, Ned. I'm not surprised by that at all. You did say you had a plan, right? [crosstalk] Do you still have that plan?
Clint: I do have a plan. My plan is— I have one phase of the plan to convince his parents and one phase of the plan to convince Calvin to participate.
Griffin: Okay. Then you’re walkin’ up and just knocking?
Clint: That's it.
Griffin: Okay, you knock and a few seconds pass and the front door opens and Sheriff Zeke Owens opens the door. [Clint nervously chuckles] And he says:
Sheriff Owens: Now, what are you doin’ at my house, Ned?
Ned: Hello Sheriff, good to see you! Yes, uh, well, I have a very promising opportunity for your family and your son, Calvin, that I'd like to discuss with you.
Sheriff Owens: You have an opportunity— don't tell me it has something to do with that museum of supernatural [Ned: No.] bullcrap that you’re peddling down—
Ned: That's only one side of Ned Butterfly Chicane, my friend.
Sheriff Owens: I heard you ran into some spot of financial trouble down there at that little tourist trap. [sarcastic] I was real sorry to hear about that, Ned. Would hate for your shop to get crushed under the weight of the free market.
Ned: Well, sure, if it is the shop that has brought quite a nice population back into town. The tourism is back up, a lot of the people coming to see the Cryptonomica, and that's good for business. People coming into the Cryptonomica, staying in the Motel 6, eating at the Taco Bell.
Sheriff Owens: [sarcastic] I mean, we gotta take care of the Taco Bell. I wouldn't exactly call the clientele you bring in the savoriest characters. [Ned: Oh, no.] What do you want, Ned?
Ned: May I come in, Zeke? May I call you Zeke?
Sheriff Owens: I don't think we're there, Sheriff Owens [crosstalk] is fine.
Ned: Sheriff Owens! That's what I meant, Sheriff Owens.
Sheriff Owens: Ned, this isn't a “come inside my house” situation, this is a “tell me what you want so I can shut the door on you if I don't like it” situation. So, go ahead, let ‘er rip.
Ned: Sheriff, I am more than just the operator of a fabulously wonderful curio shop. I don't know if you know this or not, but I am an alumni of the Ohio State University and I have a lot of connections still at the University. Perhaps you did not know this, but Ohio State is one of the top swimming programs in collegiate sports and I have pulled a few strings and I have a couple of friends there at the University who might be interested in offering young Calvin a scholarship to become a Buckeye!
Sheriff Owens: I mean, Calvin’s gonna be a Mountaineer like his daddy and his granddaddy before him.
Ned: [nervous chuckle] I love the blue and the gold [the team’s colors]! But in this case, we may be talking about a full ride from a University— a swimming program that graduates over a 3.15 average. They have finished in the top twenty-five for the last twenty-two years. Uh—
Travis: This episode sponsored by [chuckles] Ohio University.
[Justin chuckles]
Griffin: Alright, so, go ahead and roll Manipulate Someone. M’kay.
Clint: So it’s seven plus one for charm. That's eight.
Griffin: That is an eight. They'll do it, but only if you do something for them right now to show that you mean it. If you ask too much, they'll tell you what, if anything, it would take for them to do it.
Clint: Okay.
Sheriff Owens: Uh, do you have any kind of documentation to back this up, Ned? Do you have some sorta proof of your excellent attendance at—
Ned: Well, as a matter of fact, I do have a picture on my phone of myself and Ohio State swim coach, Bill Watley. [going through his phone] Here you gooo and… there! Now, I'm a little thinner then [chuckle] but here. You can see this picture of me and Bill— Big Bill. I call him Big Bill. And, uh, there you can see us there standing there next to each other. That's Bill Watley, the coach of Ohio State. You notice how he has a camaraderielly arm around my shoulders?
Griffin: Yeah, that was a heck of a word. Two things— one, is this a phone that Ned just kind of keeps on him for music and pics, because there’s definitely no service out here; second question, is this just a picture of you and some random dude?
Clint: Yeah. Oh, yeah! [laughing] Yeah. I don’t know Bill Watley, are you out of your mind?
Griffin: Sure. He says,
Sheriff Owens: All right. I mean—
Ned: Just hear me out! Here’s all I want to do, this is all I want to do— if Calvin would be interested, I would like to shoot a video of Calvin, just like a promotional video to send to Watley and the folks at Ohio State. And I have this really amazing idea, I just want to borrow Calvin for a short period of time, a couple of hours, to shoot a promotional video. I have this idea that I think, if we can do that, like an interview, get to know Calvin, and— and I have a really, I think, a clever way to get into it, of him— I happen to have, in my possession, an item that I think Calvin could display and I think it would really get their attention. Are you familiar with the name Michael Phelps, at all? You know Michael Phelps?
Sheriff Owens: Yeah, of course, everybody knows Michael Phelps.
Ned: I have his first gold medal, from Athens—
Sheriff Owens: Why do you have that? Ned Chicane, what?
Ned: It was loaned to me, to put on display at the Cryptonomica! It was the one he won for the 400 metre medley, uh, in two-thousand—
Sheriff Owens: Yeah, sure.
Ned: And I just thought Calvin would get a kick out of wearing that gold medal, and doing an interview, and— it just would, it would just go worlds towards getting him a scholarship to be an Ohio State Buckeye. [sings] Drive, drive on down the field! Or pool! Or whatever would be!
Justin: I need to— this scene is going great. I need to take a moment just to talk amongst all of ourselves and the listeners, as a family. If Calvin Owens’ dad agrees to send his precious boy [Travis: Mmhmm] with this elderly man [Travis: Uh huh.] with a huge car—
Clint: [crosstalk] Not elderly!
Travis: [crosstalk] Uh huh.
Justin: —who says he’s gonna film a promotional swimming video of him, Calvin Owens’ dad will be taken to parent court and tried [crosstalk] for the highest crimes {{32:00, indecipherable}}
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, I got a solution, I got a fix for this. Okay.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: You see him stand there and kind of think for a minute, like he’s actually trying to think of what the best thing for his kid would be. But he sighs, and he says,
Sheriff Owens: No, Ned, I don’t think that’s gonna happen. He’s grounded anyway, he skipped out on swimming practice this morning. Ned, he— get this, he said he was scared of the water all of a sudden? He said he was afraid there was monsters in the water. Now, hmm. Why would a kid living in Kepler believe such a thing existed, Ned? Maybe because there’s a proprietor of a certain museum going around town peddling those kinds of stories?
Ned: Aahh...you don’t think he really believes in all that hooey, do you, Zeke?
Sheriff Owens: He believes it enough to skip out of practice, something he’s never done before. I’ll tell you what, Ned, it’s gonna be a pass for me, so why don’t you leave now, and stay away from my son, how does that sound?
Griffin: And he slams the door in your face. And as you sort of take a step back from the force of the door slamming, there is a tree to the side of the yard, and you hear some rustling in that tree, and you see Calvin Owens scurry off the roof of the house, out of his bedroom window, and down the tree, and he kind of crouch-runs over to your car, where he kind of hides behind it.
Clint: Ok. Ned walks over to him.
Griffin: You both get into the car. He’s kind of trying to duck down, and he’s like,
Calvin: All right, man, go, go, go, go.
Clint: So we go, man, go! We pull out and I turn to him, and I say,
Ned: Calvin, I only have so much bullshit that I can fling in a certain time period. Would you like to help my friends and I get rid of that thing that scared the living crap out of you?
Calvin: Yeah, man, that would be great. I don’t know if you can smell it on me, I haven’t had a shower in a couple days, and ain’t had no water to drink, I’ve been living on milk and Coke, so I guess my bones are getting something out of this situation. I’m happy to help out, but technically you’re kidnapping right now, so let’s be quick.
Ned: Gotcha. Do you have your driver’s license?
Calvin: No.
Ned: Permit? You’re a high school student, every kid wants to drive.
Calvin: I’m working on it. The test is hard, get off my case.
Ned: All right, look. We’re about three blocks away from your house. I hope you did the old pillows-under-the-sheets routine.
Calvin: Yeah, I Bueller-ed it up in there.
Ned: Listen, the Mark III practically drives itself.
Travis: [sarcastic] You know how easy to drive those 1950s cars made out of steel are.
Ned: Practically— it’s like the Jetson’s car. It’ll drive itself.
Travis: It’s so intuitive! This 8-ton vehicle.
Ned: Let’s get behind— you get behind the wheel, I’ll pop the top, and we’ll get a’ distractin’, how do you feel about that plan?
Calvin: I feel...kind of just okay about it.
Ned: I will take that.
{35:02}
Griffin: Aubrey—
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: You are driving in Mama’s old pickup truck with Barclay at the wheel, as you head out to H2-Whoa. You all have left town—
Travis: I’m sorry, H2-Whoa, That Was Fun.
Griffin: H2-Whoa, That Was Fun. You’re on this pine tree-lined road out of the East side of town, winding around Mount Kepler, heading towards the park. You’ve been living at Amnesty Lodge for a couple months now, what’s your relationship like with Barclay, would you say?
Travis: I would say we get along very well! I— not quite to, like, BFFs or anything, but, you know, like a co-worker that you have a lot of fun with, and often would grab a drink after work? That’s it. So if I’m gonna define it, after-work, grab-a-drink friends, not necessarily “call up on your free day to see what they’re doing” friends.
Griffin: Sure. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Then, I think you’re fairly comfortable in this ride with him. He— you’re getting close, and he kind of breaks the silence of the car, and he says,
Barclay: So...Agent Stern. Have you had much of a chance to talk with our new federal friend?
Aubrey: No, honestly, I’ve been a little bit distracted, Barclay. Lot going on, not just the monster thing, but I’m trying to figure a lot of shit out, and if I’m being honest, and I think maybe you’ll agree with this— I was kinda hoping Mama would just come back and take care of it.
Barclay: Yeah, uh. I think that we can’t count on that anymore. Just— listen, if he comes around asking you questions about Bigfoot, you know not to say anything, right?
Aubrey: Yeah.
Barclay: Yeah, maybe come to me and let me know what he asks you about? Obviously this is gonna complicate my life a little bit.
Aubrey: Barclay, if he comes talk to me, I’ll play up the “I’m a kid, I don’t know!” blah, blah, blah, blah, blah thing. I’ve done that act a thousand times, don’t worry about it.
Griffin: He says,
Barclay: I appreciate that. It may not surprise you to learn, I’ve left a little bit of a— no pun intended, a footprint during my travels, before I met up with Mama, so he probably has a decent amount to go on, unfortunately.
Aubrey: Hey Barclay, can I change the subject a little bit?
Barclay: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] By which I mean, a whole lot. What do you— and it’s fine if the answer is nothing— what do you know about, like, Sylvan magic?
Barclay: Uuhh...Aubrey, I’m real sorry, but I know next to nothing, that’s really not my area of expertise.
Aubrey: But, like, where does it come from? How about— can we start with, is it from the big ol’ crystal thing? Or is it, like, something people are born with? Like, where does it come— just that. Cause you talk about everybody— you have the spring, and you talk about everybody needing magic, right? Like, Sylvan energy. Where does that come from?
Barclay: Well, from what I understand, Aubrey, the— Sylvain is not just a place, it’s a— it’s a being. It’s not just the crystal coming out of the ground out there, it’s the planet itself. It’s the life force of the planet, I guess you could call it. So I guess the springs, you know, the water kind of comes up deep from the Earth, it’s got a little bit of that Earth-force in it, too. There’s— the Sylvans, they need to be sustained by the planet itself. And so whether that’s their planet or ours, it seems like it gets the job done. So you want to know where that magic comes from, it’s from, you know, the planet. Which, I don’t even know if you realise that, every time you go over there, you’re not heading to some, you know, through a magical portal into another dimension and another time, it’s— that’s another place, somewhere out in the sky somewhere.
Aubrey: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Barclay: You’re actually, I guess y’all are astronauts, so, congratulations.
Aubrey: Okay. I’ll process that later. Barclay, if this is weird, if— hmm. [slowly] Is the magic alive?
Barclay: I mean, you’re alive, and you’re using the magic, so I gue— Aubrey, you’ve got to understand, I don’t know the first thing about magic. My whole thing is, you know, big and strong Bigfoot monster, so.
Aubrey: Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you were in Sylvain, could you hear the mag— the crystal ta-lk?
Griffin: He doesn’t really say anything when you ask him that, he kind of like— is just kind of staring straight ahead, he doesn’t even seem to acknowledge you, and he says,
Barclay: Oh, look, looks like we’re here.
Griffin: And you pull up in front of H2-Woah.
Justin: That Was Fun.
Griffin: Uh, this park is actually a lot nicer than I think you may have assumed it was. Uh, a lot of the other water parks fell prey to the natural forces of decay a lot worse than H2-Woah does. It's actually a fairly nice looking place. This entrance into the park leads through what looks like a big beached pirate ship which stands in front of a six-foot tall blue chain link fence that surrounds the perimeter of the park, keeping the surrounding pines at bay. Through that fence, you can tell that the park is mostly deserted as you would expect from a water park on a weekday in October. Hanging in front of the ship at the entrance is a large red sign announcing that their last weekend in operation is coming up before park closes down for the Winter. It's been a unseasonably warm Fall and the park’s been open much later than normal, but it seems like they're done pushing their luck. You can see a man in a ticket taking booth just inside this ship reading a magazine and you also, through that chain link fence, you notice a handful of other employees wearing blue shirts walking around the park just kind of halfheartedly cleaning up, getting the park ready for its final weekend. And Barclay, still sitting in the truck with you, says:
Barclay: Okay, so, what's our approach here?
Aubrey: I— Why don't we just go in?
Barclay: Right through the front door, straightforward?
Aubrey: Oh shit, I've got it Barclay! Here's what we do—
Barclay: Federal pool inspectors.
Aubrey: N-no…
Barclay: Oh sorry, it was stupid.
Aubrey: [comforting] No, it— hey, hey, no idea is bad. It just wasn't good. So, we’ll pay our way in, then, once we're in, find— see if we can find, like, a supply thing. Get some of them shirts and then lay low until after they close and just stay. So park, like, y'know, not in the parking lot so it's not obvious that someone's still here and then we'll just, like, hide in the closet and do some, like, Basil E. Frankweiler stuff [Clint laughs] or whatever it was, and just stay in there.
Barclay: Alright, hold on.
Griffin: And he pulls the truck back out onto the access road leading up to the park and just kinda parks it in the grass off the road. And he gets out and the two of you walk up to the entrance to the park and up to the ticket taking booth inside that ship at the entrance. And, from here, you can get a much better look at the park.
[tinny pirate music starts playing]
Griffin: You also hear this really tinny sounding pirate music playing over the loudspeakers positioned throughout the area. And inside that booth there is a man, you'd estimate about twenty five, a bit older than rest of, basically, the teens who are working in the park that you can see through the fence just cleaning up. He's got sort of a ratty mustache goin’ and he seems to take just a lot of pride in his water park work here. And he says— he's wearing a name tag also that says “Todd” on it. And Todd says:
Todd: ‘Ey, uh, we’re closed. What’ll y'all want, we ain't gonna open until our final weekend here coming up.
Aubrey: [to herself] Well, shit. Uh, Hello, Todd was it?
Todd: Yeah, its Todd Hinderflins.
[Justin and Clint chuckle]
Justin: No it's not.
[Clint chuckles]
Todd: It's Todd Flinderhins. What do you— yeah, what I can I do you for?
Aubrey: We are federal pool inspectors—
[Laughter]
Aubrey: —and my partner and I, Agent Barclay, have heard some rumblings that this whole pool might just be rife with staph infection.
Todd: There ain't any staph infection here, we wouldn't let this place [crosstalk] get filled up with—
Aubrey: Excuse me, Todd, am I supposed to just take your word for it? You think that's what they taught me at federal pool inspector school?
[Clint loses it]
Todd: I mean, we don't wanna get on the wrong side of the FPI, [Clint is still cracking up] but do you have like a badge or something you can show me?
Aubrey: Todd, there's no time for that! [Clint: Hu huh] Do you wanna open up for your last weekend and have people with their skin falling off and getting eaten through, Todd? Listen, you seem like a smart guy. A guy who’s in charge, someone who answers to no one but himself. Todd, you seem like a person I should be talking to about this, am I right?
Todd: Uh, yeah, I mean, this here is my kingdom and we don't normally let strangers into the kingdom during off hours, so, uh—
Aubrey: Let me tell— you seem busy, Todd, so I'll make you a deal. Ten minutes. You let me in, we’re in, we’re out. And I'm sure this is all just a misunderstanding but if I get a report to my higher ups that I came in, I don't want to get in trouble, you know what I mean, and you don't want to get in trouble. So, I'll come in, I'll check real quick, and then we're out.
Griffin: Why don't you roll Manipulate Someone.
Travis: Oop, that's a seven. A six plus one.
Griffin: Uh, you have one charm?
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: Okay, that is a— barely a mixed success. Uh, as was the case last time, they will do it but only if you do something for them right now to show that you mean it. If you ask too much, they'll tell you what, if anything, it would take for them to do it, and I think that's gonna be the case here. He says:
Todd: Um, alright, I can make that work, ten minutes. I think, like, twenty bucks oughta do it.
Aubrey: As long as nobody needs to hear about this, Todd, that's sounds like a deal to me. Barclay— Agent Barclay, pay the man.
Griffin: He takes you to the side and he says:
Barclay: I don't know if I have twenty dolla— I got— hold on.
Griffin: He pulls out his wallet. Um, it's a— like a Velcro— old beaten up Velcro wallet, and he's like:
Barclay: I got eleven, do you have any cash on you?
Aubrey: Um, let me see… yeah, I happen to have nine bucks, right here.
Barclay: Well, that's conv—
Travis: And Griffin can't prove otherwise.
[Laughter]
Griffin: You hand Todd the twenty dollars and he says:
Todd: Alright, I expect y'all to be back out here in ten minutes. Don't make me come looking for you.
Aubrey: You got it. We just need to go to your pump room.
Todd: I mean, y'all are federal pool inspectors, I assume you can find the pump room.
Aubrey: Yeah, don— thank you Todd, we'll be in and out your— uh, listen citizen, we’ll put in a good word for you at FPI. If you're ever looking for a job, you know where to find us. Or maybe you don't, we're a very secretive organization. Don't worry about it, we'll find you.
Griffin: Uh, let's jump to Duck. Duck, you arrive at the Kepler Public Works, a municipal building just adjacent to city hall. Kepler is a fairly small town, so a lot of the departments that you would expect to see in, sort of, a bigger city's public works are handled remotely by different contractors and local engineers around here. There's really three main offices inside the public works of Kepler. As you enter, there's Transportation, Sanitation, and Water. And you make your way into the latter, and there, in the center of the room, you see a reception desk sort of cutting off the public side room from the offices and stuff behind. And, slumped over that desk, you see Gary Sluper, your old third grade teacher now the, uh— I don't know, employee of the Kepler Public Works Water Department. He is slumped down over the reception desk. He appears to be unconscious.
Duck: Psssh, Mr… ‘ey Mr. Sluper?
Mr. Sluper: [groan] Eh?
Griffin: He, uh, he kinda looks like he's, like, talking to you in his sleep.
Duck: Mr. Sluper.
Griffin: He rouses and has a significant sort of drool tether connecting him to the desk, which he kinda swats away at with his hand. And he looks up you with bleary eyes and he says:
Mr. Sluper: Well that's, uh, that's Duck Newton. Am I dead?
Duck: Uh, no sir, you're just at work.
[Clint laughs]
Mr Sluper: That's worse in some ways.
Duck: Heh, I love that kinda humor. That office humor, I love that.
Travis: You don't have to be crazy to work here, y’know what I mean, [crosstalk] but it helps.
Duck: But it helps, yeah, [crosstalk] and all that stuff.
Mr. Sluper: Same— same— same— [Duck: Same shit, different day. I love it.] Same circus, different clowns.
Griffin: He wipes his mouth and he says:
Mr. Sluper: So you been working on your multiplication tables there, Duck? It's important stuff, y’know, I tried to warn ya.
Duck: Quiz me, man.
Mr. Sluper: A hundred times six.
Duck: Six hundred, right there!
[Clint laughs]
Mr. Sluper: Yeah, that wasn’t hard. So—
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Duck: And check this out, watch this: [clears throat] “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. [Mr. Sluper: Yep, you got it. Slow down.] Now we are engaged in a—”
Mr. Sluper: Ah Jesus, okay, yeah, that was real good, Duck. Very proud. Got a bit of a headache here, but what can I do you for?
Duck: Right, so, yes. I need a little favor from you. Uh, I need you to— at a certain point tonight, not right this second, but at a certain point tonight I'm gonna need you to shut off the water supply to H2-Woah, That Was Fun.
Mr. Sluper: The water park?
Duck: Yeah, that's the one. Now, it's gonna be after operating hours so we're not gonna have any issue but we have got— we're running some of the fire fighting drills and you remember last time we just couldn't get the pressure that we needed to really simulate the environment of fighting a real fire. The hoses didn't feel real, none of it felt real, and I wanna give the folks a real sense of what it's like to battle a fire with full pressure. So I'm hoping if we could shut down that— I can't think of anything that's more draining on the system than H2-Woah, That Was Fun. And maybe if we can shut that down then we give, like, that real, y’know, like, “you are there” kinda sense.
Mr. Sluper: That's a doozy there, Duck. I'm guessing you got all the permits you need, Duck. Duck, why do they call you Duck, anyhow?
Duck: It's my nickname. So, do you think you'll be able to help or no, or what?
Mr. Sluper: I tell you what, here's what I'm gonna do for you.
Duck: Yeah.
Mr. Sluper: I'm gonna go to my office over there and I'm gonna go to sleep, but, before I do that, I'm gonna get my best mind on this… whatever it was you just said, alright?
Griffin: And he pushes back from the reception desk and walks over to a door to his office, which he opens up and, right before he closes the door behind him, he yells:
Mr. Sluper: Hey, Pidge! Get on out here. Got an old student of mine that needs assistance.
Griffin: And he shuts the door to his office, and you can see through the frosted glass and he finds a new desk to take a nap on. And from a hallway that turns off behind the reception counter, you see Pigeon Wilson.
Justin: [crosstalk] He—heeeeyyyy!
Travis: [crosstalk] Awwwww…
Griffin: She is wearing a orange vest and her face lights up with delight as she sees you, and she yells:
Pigeon: Ranger Duck! Ranger Duck, it's me Pigeon! From a couple months back with the big bear?
Duck: Pigeon, how the heck are ya?
Pigeon: I'm doing great, man. Just, y’know, same circus, different clowns here down at the public works, so, uh—
[Travis laughs]
Duck: Keeping your nose clean?
Pigeon: Oh man, Ranger Duck, it's real good to see ya. I ain't never got the chance to thank you saving my buddy, Pete’s, bacon.
Duck: Sure, yeah. I'm— you do have a chance to thank me, though. I need a little bit of help with something. I’d love to catch up, but I’m in a little bit of a rush.
Pigeon: You got a nasty— nasty pothole you need filled or something?
Duck: Uh, no. I need you to shut off the water supply to H2-Whoa That Was Fun.
Griffin: She looks kind of surprised when you say that. She says:
Pigeon: Why do you need to take down a water park there, Ranger Duck?
Duck: Why did you need to hide out in the forest and start a bunch of fires there, Pidge?
Griffin: She smiles kind of devilishly as you say that and she walks to the reception desk and opens up a book that’s there, and then she thinks for a second and closes that book and she says:
Pigeon: You like coffee, Ranger Duck?
Duck: Yeah, uh— yeah, I do. I take it black, I bet.
Pigeon: Why don’t we head over to the break room? I got something important I need to talk to you about.
{Amnesty theme plays}
[Money Zone and Jumbotrons, end {59:45}]
{Amnesty theme plays}
Griffin: Let’s jump back to Ned. Ned, what’s your plan here? So we can set up the scene.
Clint: Well, we’re to kind of find the water monster and kind of run it ragged— just kind of drive along, using ourselves as bait, and— uh— I was thinking Route 160/155—
Griffin: Alongside the river?
Clint: Yeah, it has all those scenic overlooks, you know, where people stop to take pictures. So I figure we drive to one, get its attention, try to give everybody else all the time they need.
Griffin: Alright, I like that a lot. So you are on this county road, that runs alongside the Greenbrier River. There’s nobody out right now, the road seems clear as you reach a certain mile marker— no, it wouldn’t be a mile marker, ‘cause you wouldn’t be too far from town, it’s gotta be within the perimeter, but you find a nice stretch of road here in that circle that runs alongside the river. And what do you do to summon the thing? You got Calvin driving the car?
Clint: Yeah, well we’re gonna pull over at the first scenic overlook, and—
Ned: Calvin, come up here, if you— no, put it in park— God, you really don’t know how to drive.
Calvin: Yeah, which one’s the stopping one?
Ned: That’s, uh— yeah, where it’s the “P”. Put it in “P”. Good—
Calvin: No, I meant the pedal. Which one makes the car not go anymore?
Ned: That’s the one that’s across, I think.
Griffin: So you are parked on this scenic overlook. It’s not, I don’t think, up on a cliff. It’s just sort of like, a little— kind of like a picnic area at a rest stop overlooking the river. And Calvin is in the car, back on the road, and he has the engine running as you sort of approach this overlook. What do you do?
Clint: Ned stands right there at the edge overlooking— there’s kind of like a railing, and you can look down at the river— and Ned in his most projecting voice, you know, you gotta bring it from the diaphragm, you gotta project so the back of the house can hear you:
Ned: Ah, yes, look at it, Calvin Owens, swim team captain! Look at this view! This is the land that born ya, lad. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, you, Calvin Owens, the swimming guy, you will look back on these fertile hills, these lush green valleys, and think: this is my home. This is the place that made me, Calvin Owens, the swimmer, from the pool a couple of days ago—
Griffin: Yeah, the water monster gets it.
Travis: I love that, in Ned’s mind, the water monster knows Calvin’s name.
Griffin: No, I think the water monster at the very least hears Ned’s voice. What you see is: there’s some movement sort of naturally on the river, just some ripples as it follows its usual course. Some ripples that have been left, reverberating for a long time, as some barges passed some time ago. But as you start shouting, the water for a moment just stands completely still, completely placid. It is a strange sight to behold. You’ve never seen the Greenbriar stand at silent attention like this.
[Waves On The River starts playing]
Griffin: And then, from down the river back upstream a bit, you see a small wave move, in almost a straight line that spans the entire river, down towards you and past you. And then another wave, larger. And it keeps going like that, larger and larger and larger until there are—
Clint: Does it look like horses?! Does it look like horses made out of water?!
Griffin: No, we’re not doing a Lord of the Rings. It looks like waves on the ocean. Large waves on the ocean that are now starting to reach up above ground level as the water starts to move in waves. And as the larger waves start forming, they start crashing up kind of at your feet, where you are standing at this overlook. What do you do?
Ned: Mission accomplished!
Clint: And he jumps back in the car and says:
Ned: Get the hell out of here. Go, go, go!
Calvin: Which one? The right one? The right pedal?
Ned: The— the one that makes it go! Take it out of “P”! Take it out of— see? Look! See “D”? Put it down in— yeah, good, in “D”. And push the one that goes up and down. Step on the one that goes up and down!
Griffin: He slams on it. As you are sort of teaching him how to drive a car, you notice the waves stop moving sort of directly downstream and almost start turning, as if their angle of approach is moving now diagonally, crashing onto the ground, still out on that scenic overlook, but onto the ground where you were just standing. And the car rears into drive, and you are now peeling down this road as the waves continue turning until now it seems like they are almost coming from the opposite bank and coming in your direction, getting larger and larger as they go.
Ned: Okay, Calvin. I’m going to need you to drive and stay away from the water, so that I don’t get killed by this monster. And here’s the last thing we want to happen: the last thing we want to happen is for anything to happen to me, okay? I am a key cog in this monster-hunting team, and if they don’t have me for inspiration and leadership and guidance, they will fall apart. So don’t get me killed, okay?
Griffin: As you're giving him this monologue, the waves are now moving directly in your direction from the opposite bank. They are splashing further and further up the side of the road that you are driving on and starting to almost reach the road itself. And Calvin says:
Calvin: I just still don't understand why you're not the one driv—
Griffin: And a wave comes up, threatening to splash down onto the car, and he veers into the opposite lane before correcting himself and getting back into the right lane of traffic. What do you do?
Clint: I've got the— uh, I'm gonna use the NERF Blaster. I'm gonna shoot the— I'm gonna take the NERF Blaster [crosstalk] and fire it—
Griffin: NARF! It’s NARF, c’mon!
Clint: [crosstalk] NARF! NARF, sorry.
Griffin: [sarcastic] There are lawyers who are listening to every episode we put out.
Clint: I have a Connecticut accent. [Justin snorts] I'm gonna shoot a dart into the water monster. And I realize it's not gonna do any harm, but I just wanna get its attention and, maybe, [Griffin: Sure.] maybe, maybe, maybe slow it down a little bit. Maybe that'll give it something to think about while we get the hell outta here.
Griffin: Um, let's roll to Kick Some Ass. I think this thing is definitely now in- creating large enough waves that it can reach you to also threaten you, so this would be Kick Some Ass roll.
Clint: That is a seven plus zero.
Griffin: Okay, on a seven plus, you and whatever you're fighting inflict harm on eachother. So, describe what you do with your NARF Blaster.
Clint: Well, the tops down on the Lincoln and so I throw my coat back and I've got the NARF Blaster on a, uh, on a thong? No…
Travis: Yes. Yeah, no, that's right.
Clint: It's strapped on! Yeah, I'm strapped, I'm fully NARF-strapped.
Justin: I wanna stick with thong. [giggles]
Clint: Thong, okay, It's on a thong. [Griffin: Okay.] I mean, that kind of follows the whole swimming thing, right?
Justin: There ya go. Just like Michael Phelps, always wears the thong.
Clint: Michael Phelps, wears that— yeah! And, so—
Griffin: With a NERF gun in it, for aerodynamic sakes.
[Justin chuckles]
Clint: So, just— I mean, is the water in front of us, beside us, behind us?
Griffin: It's rolling off the river to your right and its splashing towards you. It's to your right.
Clint: Okay, I'm just gonna, from the hip, shoot from the hip because it'd be kinda hard to miss a giant wave. Just fire off a dart right into the water to see what happens.
Travis: Uh, just a side note for everyone out there, don't Google “thong weapon”. [Clint laughs] You won't be happy with it.
Griffin: Okay, you've never fired this thing before so you whip it around from this strap and hip fire it up into the air, into the pipeline of this wave as it threatens to crash down on you. And you describe what comes out of this weapon.
Clint: Well, it's a— it kind of has this coruscating blue light that kind of surrounds it. It's vaguely NERF dart-shaped and it leaves a little contrail of after-image, like burns in your eyes when you look at something bright. It just fires straight off that way and shoots straight ahead.
Griffin: Coruscating, by the way, means “flashing or sparkling”. So, uh, that's for our friends at home and for me, ‘cuz I just had to Google it. [Clint: Sorry, I—] I think it's like a—
Clint: Increase your word power kinda thing.
Griffin: Sure, I think it's like a phantom NERF dart. Like a— it's in the shape of one with this sparkling trail that follows behind it, and I think it's considerably sized. I think it's a little bit larger than the average NARF dart that you would expect. It shoots up into the side of the pipeline and splits the wave as it hits it, really hitting it with a lot of power. You do two harm to the wave as it [Clint: Woaaahh!] splashes down on you. [crosstalk] Uh, and—
Clint: That Was Fun!
Griffin: ...it splits. I think the way it deals damage is, as it splits, it doesn't crash down immediately in front of your car, but an enormous amount of water deluge splashes down right in front of the car. And, as it does, it kind of floods the road right in front of you and you start to fishtail, and Calvin, not really knowing what to do, kinda jerks the wheel back and forth. And you, because you're kind of in this position to blast this wave, you were not exactly strapped in very, very safely and you bash your head into the [Clint groans] top of the windshield, as the top was down, and take one harm.
Clint: Yikes!
Griffin: The next wave that comes up, it kinda splashes down a little bit further away than the road and then another further even still. And these waves start to recede as you can tell that the water monster has sensed some sort of threat from you and decided to make its escape, as its custom. Calvin pulls over to the side of the road and is kinda panting, is clearly kinda freaked because of what just happened. And he turns the car off and gets out and is kind of just like pacing at the side of the car.
Ned: I hit my head! Owwww! I really thought the thong would protect me more than that.
Calvin: Yeah, Ned, I'm sorry you hit your head but we also almost just died in a car accident because I don't know what the fuck it is I'm doing. Ned, I need you to get me home. Ned, I gotta get back, I can't do this anymore. It's just me and my brother and my dad at home, anything happens to me like what just almost happened— I can't. I just gotta wait this thing out and hope that y'all can stop it before the meet. Ray Hall High’s team’s been talking a bunch of trash on my Facebook and I gotta put them in their place. I gotta focus on that, kids stuff, y’know?
Ned: So, you're okay now with getting back in the water? I mean, look kid! You've faced this, you faced a giant crashing wave of doom and you're alive, right?! And you saw [chuckle] I pretty much kicked the shit out of it. You saw that, right? So you know we can handle this. So you get back in that water, young man, and you swimmm!
Calvin: I can’t, Ned. I just can't.
Griffin: And he throws you the keys and he starts walking down the road back into town. Jump back to Aubrey: Aubrey, you are now inside H2-Whoa That Was Fun, and you are— you have ten minutes to scout the area out. The way I kind of have this envisioned, there are a few points of interest I can tell you about, and you tell me what you sort of want to check out with your limited time here. There are a few main water slides toward the back of the park. There’s like a long drop one, a twisting tubes one, there’s one of those funnel ones that kind of drops you out into a funnel that you spin around and drop out the bottom. There is a wave pool towards the center of the park, a fairly large wave pool. There is a splash pad towards the front of the park where kids can come and play in this water that shoots up from the ground. There is a small pool with a swim-up bar. There is towards the back corner of the park a gated-off reservoir that you can see with some sort of machinery back there with it. There is a lazy river that surrounds the perimeter of most of the attractions. There is a gift shop and cafeteria. There is a shallow kiddie pool with some mushroom fountains in it. And there is a main office off to the side of the park near the center.
Aubrey: So it seems to me, Barclay, like we want to keep it away from kind of the splash pad, right? Because there’s too many— if we can’t see the water, and if it can come from any different location, we’re kind of putting ourselves at a bit of a disadvantage.
Barclay: Yeah, that’s a good call. I think you might want to figure out which spot in the park is going to be the most advantageous for us to take it on, and then it might be a good idea for us to figure out some other way to control it, some way that we can ensure that we’re going to be here in private, some way to access everything we need to access in the park whenever we want to do this thing.
Aubrey: Oh, shit. I have an idea, Barclay.
Barclay: Okay, let’s hear it.
Aubrey: At first I was going to say the kiddie pool, right? Because it’s nice and shallow. But if we can get it in the wave pool, and turn it on, that’s probably going to like, fuck with it, right?
Barclay: Might throw it off balance. That’s not a bad idea.
Aubrey: It’s gonna be all slippery and hard for it to control.
Barclay: Uh, yeah. You wanna check it out?
Aubrey: You go check it out. I’m gonna see if I can get into the main office. ‘Cause checking it out doesn’t do us any good if we can’t, like, turn everything on, you know?
Barclay: Yeah, okay. I’ll go check out that, you head to the main office, we’ll meet up in ten minutes back at the entrance?
Aubrey: Yeah, and keep an eye open for any like back gates or something we can leave unlocked, to get in later.
Barclay: Okay. I’ll do just that.
Griffin: So you head over to the main office. You walk by a few confused-looking teens working here as you go. Uh, and—
Aubrey: Oh, Todd said it was okay!
Griffin: Oh, they nod. And then one of them says:
Teen 1: He’s kind of a dick, in’t he?
Aubrey: How dare you.
Griffin: A young guy yells:
Teen 2: We hate Todd!
Justin: Whoa. A lot of deep-seated resentment towards Todd here.
Aubrey: We’re gonna have to unpack this later, but I’m on— yeah! Okay!
Teen 3: I like Todd.
Griffin: And the other one goes:
Teen 1: Shut the fuck up! Nobody likes Todd!
Justin: How many of them’s are there?
Griffin: There’s only the three that you just heard.
Justin: Okay, got it.
Griffin: And you approach the main office and find it unlocked and enter. The main office is really just one large, empty room. There is a timeclock and a desk with a bunch of paperwork on it to the side of the room as you enter. In the corner, there is a first aid station set up with various supplies to treat burns and bee stings and other water park injuries. On the back wall of the room there is a row of lockers, a dozen or so, including the locker of Todd, which you recognize in the center.
Justin: [grandly] The Locker of Todd!
Griffin: The Toddlocker!
Justin: Fabled Locker of Todd!
Travis: We found it!
Griffin: Now you can also tell, just being in here, there is no what appears to be, like- security camera setup. So you glean that there are no cameras for you to worry about to whenever you do your Hunt here tonight.
Travis: Excellent. Now is this a control room as well? Or is this just for them to come in and then drop off their stuff and then get to work?
Griffin: Yeah, this seems to be a— “drop stuff off and change into your outfits before you start working”. That’s not to say there isn’t stuff to investigate here, though.
Travis: I want to look in Todd’s locker.
Griffin: It’s locked! Todd’s locker is locked. It’s a locker. It’s locked. Like lockers do. You approach it, you try to open it, but the thing doesn’t work because of the lock.
Justin: It’s defined by its ability to lock.
Travis: Oh, no I— Listen, I'm getting it, I'm all over that. Let me see, is the lock in the locker or is it like a padlock that is—
Griffin: Yeah, it's in the locker, it's like one of the little plastic dials like you would have at a locker at school.
Travis: You know what, I'm so sorry Todd, I'm gonna melt the lock.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: There we go.
Griffin: Uh, roll to— I think this would just be Use Magic.
Travis: Yeah, so that's nine… eleven. Nine plus two.
Griffin: Uh, okay, no glitches. What does this look like? I assume you're using some sort of [crosstalk] heat or fire?
Travis: I'm gonna say, yeah, like, as finesse as possible, just, like, one finger to the lock and maybe, if I can help it, just be pulling on it and heat it just enough to pull it open, y'know what I mean?
Griffin: Sure, yeah, no, you stick your finger into the lock beneath the dial and, as you do so, your finger heats up and, slowly but surely, your finger starts to pierce through the lock until you have poked clean through the locker. And you hear a click and the locker door starts to swing open. Inside, you find some—
Travis: Gold! [does the Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare]
Griffin: Two hundred and fifty gold pieces and a magic sword. You find probably some, y’know, raunchy mags. You find—
Travis: Heh, Todd!
Griffin: You find a Pokémon card collection. You find a ring of keys. Uh, that—
Travis: I take that ring of keys, Griffin.
Griffin: Each key seems to be labeled for each of the different attractions around the park, and then you also find towards the back a notepad. And on that notepad is scribbled out the schedule for each of the employees here. You find the current day and on it you find the four employees who are currently at the park, and you find out that the last to punch out is Todd, who leaves at six, at which point the park will be vacated.
Travis: Okay, I'm going to— is this where I can Investigate a Mystery to ask you, the DM, something?
Griffin: Sure, yeah.
Travis: Okay… meh, that's not good.
Griffin: Whenever you fail a roll, I get to take a hard move.
Travis: Oh no.
Griffin: Yeah, so go ahead and mark experience.
Travis: Yes, but Griffin don't you see? I don't want to have failed. [crosstalk] Did you think about it that way?
Justin: [crosstalk] Mmm, interesting.
Griffin: An interesting concept. Uh, you mark exp. You also hear the door to the main office here open up, and you see Todd with one of his nudie magazines rolled up and he's got it kinda in his armpit as he walks in trying to hide it. And he walks into the room and sees you and the raunchy mag falls to the ground dramatically in slow-motion. And he says:
Todd: What the fuck are you doing!? What happened to my lock— what are you doing to my locker!?
Aubrey: Well, Todd, I have to be honest with you. I'm not really from the FPI. I'm working for Heironymus Horatio Aurelius, the owner of H2-Woah, That Was Fun, [Justin giggles] and he is expecting—
[Justin and Clint laugh]
Griffin: Because this is a hard move, I get to [Travis: Uh huh.] go kind of hard. I think he shakes his head and he says:
Todd: No, you get the fuck out of my park right now.
Griffin: And he walks over to the desk at the corner of the room and picks up a phone and dials 911.
Travis: Okay, is his back to me?
Griffin: [nervously] Uh, it is. I say, terrified.
Travis: I'm going to—
Griffin: Kill Todd with fire!?
Travis: No! No, just send a little fireball to melt the cord on the phone.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I'm just trying to sever the— I just don't want the cops showing up. That would be bad.
Griffin: Alright, cool.
Travis: So, I rolled an eight plus two, so it's a ten.
Griffin: Are you doing this discreetly, I'm assuming?
Travis: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Griffin: Okay, I will say on—
Travis: And I'm trying to aim for the actual panel on the wall, right, so it melts, yeah.
Griffin: Then you just see the cable— I think just a small, very narrow red beam comes out and severes, very quickly, the cable in the blink of an eye and it falls to the ground. And Todd looks kind of confused and walks over to the phone.
Aubrey: You're right, you're right, I'm gonna go. Yep, I'm on my way right out the door.
Travis: And she leaves still carrying the keys.
Griffin: Okay. You meet up with Barclay back outside of the park, and he says:
Barclay: I got a look at the wave pool. There's a booth back behind it above the little alcove where they actually make the waves. It seems like there's some sort of control mechanism in there. I couldn't get inside but the door was locked but—
Aubrey: Good neeeeews!
Barclay: What's that?
Aubrey: I have the keys and it went super smoothly. No problems at all.
Barclay: Alright, well, I guess we’ll come back here tonight at some point. I wish I knew what time they were leaving.
Aubrey: After six!
Barclay: Well damn, this is one of the smoother plans we've ever come up with, it seems like.
Aubrey: Yeah, everything went great!
[Clint chuckles]
Griffin: And Duck, let's jump back to you. You are in the break room of the Public Works building with Pigeon and she's produced a nice- well, you know, as nice as a local government building cup of coffee is gonna be, for you and makes one for herself and sits you down at the table with her. There's nobody else in the room, you have some privacy to talk in here. She says:
Pigeon: So, uh, why is it you want to shut down the water down at H2-Woah, That Was Fun? I love that park, so I'm not eager to do anything damaging to its business.
Duck: It's just temporary, Pigeon, it's not gonna be a whole thing.
Pigeon: Yeah, I—
Duck: That's why the parks closed, so it's not gonna impact you or anything.
Pigeon: Well, I know how to do it, I just wanna know why.
Duck: Perfect. Perfect. Why? It's for firefighter training? Yeah, it's for firefighter training. [Clint chuckles] It's been a little while since I last told someone that, so I had some time to forget it. But it's for firefighting training, cuz we can't get enough water pressure to fight the fires, forest fires.
Pigeon: Out in Monongahela?
Duck: Yeeeeeeep.
Pigeon: Duck, that's on the opposite side of town. I can find other places that I can get you some more water pressure instead of pumping it out of the water park almost a mile away.
Duck: Yeah, but the water park is definitely gonna be closed. If you can tell me somewhere where you can guarantee that they're not gonna need that amount of water that's using that amount, I'd love to hear about it. Cus, off the top of my head, I can't improvise anything.
Pigeon: There's a reservoir right next to Monongahela.
Duck: The reservoir is a source of water but it's not gonna give other— fuck, listen Pigeon, here's the thing. I... love... to… [Clint wheezes in laughter] practice fishing. But... the running water... frightens me, it's called hydrophobia. And I would love to practice my cast in a real water environment where I can get in a large body where I can guarantee that running water won't be a factor. And I would just love to practice my cast in a guaranteed still body. But here's the other thing, sometimes if you do it in a lake, that's what you're thinking, a fish will bite it and normally that's ideal, but I'm just trying to practice casting. It's like, when you don't want to catch, that's when they're biting, y’know what I mean? So I need a still body of water that I can guarantee won't move to practice my fishing casting.
Griffin: I want you to roll Manipulate Someone. I'm tempted to—
Justin: With what, Griffin! With [Griffin: Yeah.] hot butter dice? Like, what would be a dumb enough [Griffin: Yeah, I think—] dice to roll?
Griffin: Well, there is mechanic. I'm gonna make you take a minus one forward on this one, because me, as the Keeper, have decided this is the wor— in the almost four years we've been doing “The Adventure Zone”, [Justin laughs] the worst lie I've ever, ever heard.
Travis: [Laughs] But not only worst, but worst, most elaborate lie.
Justin: I used to do a character who was very good at lying. I wanna do one that's very bad.
Griffin: Sure, yeah. Uh, that's—
Justin: Yeah— aaaaahh, damn it. [Laughs] I rolled a five. Maybe my worst roll in the longest—
Griffin: Plus charm, plus charm.
Justin: Plus charm minus one, so that's a five.
Griffin: Alright. [Justin: Full stop.] Mark experience.
Justin: It's an experience. I'm learning something.
Griffin: I get to take a hard move to complicate your life, and I have just the thing in mind. Pigeon says:
Pigeon: Y’know Duck, I've been thinking a lot about what happened that night, what I saw chasing me through the woods. Pete told me he got a real close look at it, he swears up and down that it weren't no bear and I am inclined to agree. Now Pete says he also seen you fight that thing off, gave him a chance to scurry away. Now, I'm also an avid reader of the local paper and I ain't seen nothing in there about a big beast terrorizing campers out in the woods. That's enough to make me assume that maybe it's not out there anymore. Maybe somebody took it down. So I'll make you a deal there, Ranger Duck. I'll shut down the supply to the water park, Duck, I gotta be on site for it to happen but I can do it, but you gotta satisfy my curiosity a bit.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Pigeon: Because I think you got more going on than just protecting some trees out in the woods, not that that's not noble work or anything, but I think you got something on the side. I think you are doing a bit of monster hunting. And, if that's the case, I gotta a follow-up question for you, I guess... Y’all hiring?"

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone...
Griffin: You just see... water. Then you see your body, and you are face-up. You look unconscious, and you are falling.
Janelle: You will be unable to harness all of the elements until you stop thinking of them as primitive weapons, and instead treat them as they truly are: as blessings from a cosmic force beyond your current comprehension.
Duck: You mean H2-Woah, That Was Fun!
Ned: [clapping] That was it! H2-Woah!
Aubrey: That’s the one!
Ned: Might be manageable, might be workable!
Aubrey: If we can get it in the wave pool, and turn it on, that’s probably going to fuck with it, right?
Pigeon: I’ll shut down the supply to the water park, Duck. I gotta be on site for it to happen, but I can do it, but you gotta satisfy my curiosity a bit. I think you are doing a bit of monster hunting. And if that’s the case, I got a follow-up question for you I guess... Y’all hiring?
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: The last slivers of sunlight cascade down the peak of Mt. Kepler and onto the scene at H2-Woah, That Was Fun!, casting long shadows off the towering water slides at the rear of the park. The last member of the skeleton crew working here to prepare for the park’s closing weekend left around a half hour ago. Now it’s just the three of you with Barclay in tow, standing at the entrance, readying yourselves for the battle to come. And Duck, just on cue, Minerva appears right in front of you. She turns and she looks at your surroundings and she says,
Minerva: It seems to be a work night, Duck Newton.
Travis: Do we see Minerva?
Griffin: No, only Duck can see Minerva.
Duck: Uh, yeah, we’re taking a shot at it. I don’t know how good of a plan we got but we... kinda forced our hand, you know? Gotta try something.
Aubrey: Duck, who are you talking to?
Ned: Yeah, we knew that.
Duck: [exhales] Just psyching myself up, you know? [Ned: Ah!][Aubrey: Okay, Yeah.] You know? Feeling a little nervous, like to talk to myself.
Ned: Go, Duck, go!
Duck: Yeah, thank you, I— that’s very much appreciated, I think we should all go, go go! But, I’ll just— let me step away for a moment, just kinda get myself pumped if that’s all right.
Aubrey: Yeah, totally!
Griffin: You step away, and Minerva follows suit, and she says,
Minerva: Duck, it sounds like your confidence is suffering!
Duck: Uh, well, we’re fighting water, which, I feel like i’ve seen that in, like, Kung Fu movies when they’re trying to illustrate pointlessness, so I— yeah, I’m a little stressed out, honestly.
Minerva: Do you not feel the warrior’s excitement for the battle you are about to face? I don’t understand.
Duck: I mean, I feel a deep and profound desire not to die. Uh, does that count?
Griffin: She laughs and she says,
Minerva: You will not die, Duck Newton! You are filled with a warrior’s instinct, that we share, together, and it will serve you well in combat. Your confidence, Duck Newton, it is not unearned! Your aim will be true! Do you believe me?
Duck: Well, I mean, I want to, but I also had a spooky vision where I... drowned, I think? So I’m— I dunno, I’m kinda fifty-fifty on it. If I’m following the omens to achieve my own personal legend, I’ve got one omen that tells me I’m going to beef it in a big pool, and then I got you telling me it’s going to be okay, so I dunno.
Griffin: When you mention this vision, again, this vision of Minerva that appears in front of you is not very— there aren’t any specific features that you can pick out, but you can tell she kind of takes a step back and looks kind of nervous as you say that. And then sort of realizing that ""Uh-oh, that's probably not good for getting him psyched up,"" she says:
Minerva: Look into my eyes, Duck Newton, or I guess where you would guess my eyes would be.
Duck: Okay.
Griffin: And she says,
Minerva: I will see you tomorrow.
Griffin: And then she disappears. And with that, the light finally fades as the sun finishes creeping back behind Mt. Kepler, and floodlights fastened to tall metal poles all around the park kick on automatically, illuminating the battlefield. Barclay gathers the three of you together and says,
Barclay: Okay, everyone ready?
Aubrey: Um... I mean, I guess?
Ned: Is anybody worried about something bad happening to the car? If somebody needed to stay here and keep an eye on the car... I'd miss the big battle, but...
Aubrey: Ned, I want you to listen to me very closely.
Ned: [Nervous] Mhm.
Aubrey: You are literally the only person here with a weapon that can kill it. So move your ass.
Ned: Well. Okay. Uh, I feel better now, sure. [Deadpan] Fine…
Duck: Hey listen, y'all. Before we head in there, I've got one more thing to say. The one good— I know we're all freaked out right now, but the one good thing about fighting a huge body of water is that nobody will be able to tell when we've pissed our pants.
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Duck: Now let's do it.
Griffin: Barclay says,
Barclay: All right.
Griffin: And he gestures you all toward the wave pool in the center of the park, and he says,
Barclay: Let's get wet n' wild.
Aubrey: No, Wet n' Wild is down the street.
Ned: I thought it was Sploosh n' Goosh, what—
[Justin laughs]
Travis: Okay, well then Aubrey will volunteer as tribute.
Griffin: M’kay.
Travis: I assume this is like a slope into it.
Griffin: Yeah, absolutely yes.
Travis: Kinda gradient thing. So she kicks off her super cool boots that are so so rad you guys. You know, they're leather, don't want to ruin them.
Justin: Wait, are they real leather?
Travis: No, fake leather.
Justin: There we go.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Fake leather. They're fleather.
Justin: [Laughing] As they say.
Clint: That's leather made out of feathers, yeah.
Travis: Yes, fleather.
Justin: I love when Robin Williams invents fleather.
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Justin: The whole basketball team looks great in a very humane way. [crosstalk] Then they win the game because of it.
Travis: [Crosstalk] Yes, it's really wonderful. Everyone is just so awed by their cruelty-free uniforms that they just let them dunk as much as they want.
Justin: ""They've earned this one."" The other team is cows.
[All laugh]
Travis: And she just kind of walks into the water, and then just kind of stands there and tries to think, ""How would bait think?""
Griffin: I don't think you have to think that for very long.
[{7:20} “The Water Confronted” fades in]
Griffin: There are just a few moments of quiet that falls over the park, and then you all hear a deep groaning from the pipes below the park that reverberates up through the ground. And the flood lights shining down on the wavepool, they begin to flicker erratically, and then they turn back on as the pipes fall silent.
And then a small ripple forms in the middle of the pool and lazily rolls outward towards its edges. The ripple bounces off the perimeter of the pool and travels back to the center where it collides into itself, sending a single small droplet of water into the air. It hangs there for several seconds, and then crashes back down into the water with a massive, continuous splash.
From this turbulence an arm, thick as a truck and easily 8 feet long, pulls itself out of the water. And then another follows suit, and then the two arms hoist a massive school-bus-sized watery torso out of the pool. This vaguely humanoid shape pounds its enormous fist into the water, sending water cascading high into the air. And as it falls, the elemental now towering over your party begins lumbering towards you.
Let's start with Aubrey. Aubrey, what do you do?
Aubrey: Barclay!
Travis: And she, you know, hands him the keys.
Aubrey: Go turn on the wave pool. Maximum wave? I don't know what the settings are. But whatever the highest one is... that.
Griffin: You toss him the ring of keys, and he catches it from the side of the pool and then sprints back to the control booth. And you see him quickly make his way into the booth and start fiddling with the panel. He smiles and knocks on the glass and the elemental turns to the sound of knuckles rapping against the glass in the control booth. You see Barclay with this big shit-eating grin on his face and he starts to wave, and he yells,
Barclay: I'm waving! ...Get it?
Griffin: And then he slams his hand down on a button on the control console. The elemental sort of turns away from this distraction and starts floating back in your direction. And then it seems to like, miss a step. And then it tries again and it nearly falls over as another small wave pushes past it across the surface of the pool. And then larger and larger waves still begin to just belt the elemental who pounds its hands into the water just trying to stay stable, affording you all a window to attack. So as long as the elemental is in the wave pool and the waves are active, you all take +1 ongoing for all actions against the water elemental. That just means you get a flat +1 bonus to everything you try to do.
Travis: Sick. So with that going, I guess I'm gonna like, hurl a fireball at it.
Griffin: Yeah, sure. Roll to Kick Some Ass.
Travis: So then that's eight, I rolled an eight, plus two plus one, so 11.
Griffin: Okay. On a 10+, you definitely hit it. You also get to choose one extra effect: you gain the advantage, take +1 forward or give +1 forward to another hunter; you inflict terrible harm, +1 harm; you suffer less harm, -1 harm; or you force them where you want them.
Travis: I'm going to say I'm going to grant +1 forward to Ned. Because I know Ned's got the NARF Blaster, and I'm trying to stand as distraction so he can line up a shot.
Griffin: Okay. What does that look like? What are you like doing to give him the advantage, like in fiction?
Travis: Well, and this is a line I thought of yesterday that I'm very proud of, Aubrey holds a ball of fire as this— you know, in her hand and says:
Aubrey: Hey Aqualung!
Travis: And throws it at his head, and in trying to like ""Look over here, look at me, stupid!""
Griffin: Okay, you're just trying to gain its attention.
Travis: Yes. I feel like you guys don't appreciate the Aqualung thing.
Griffin: I mean, you just said Aqualung—
Justin: The problem was the several minutes of buildup I think.
Travis: Yeah, that's fair, but like how clever are they you know?
[Griffin laughs]
Justin: [Crosstalk] Hey, oh yeah yeah yeah.
Clint: [Crosstalk] Just for an Aqualung? But does that mean—
Justin: It's like in... you know in the— I love the moment in Casablanca where he's like, [imitating Humphrey Bogart] ""Hey I'm about to say some dope shit. Here's lookin' at you, kid."" Like, it's a little bit blunting.
Griffin: Okay—
Justin: ""I just thought of something cool to say before I leave, Scarlet. Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" And then he opens the door back up. ""What did you think?"" It's so—
Travis: ""Did you get it?""
Justin: ""Did you get it?""
Clint: ""I feel like it didn't really land.""
Travis: ""I didn't get as much appreciation from that as I thought. Can I try it again?""
Griffin: What— how much harm do you do on your fireball attack?
Travis: Two harm, and then with fire, another two harm. And because I rolled a 10+ I don't have to worry about the fire spreading in the water.
Griffin: Yeah, that would have been wild for me to try to get that going. But I think just last time, you do hit it, but it does not seem to be quite as damaging as you would have hoped because you are throwing a fireball at a massive creature made out of water. You threw a really good fireball, so it definitely still does some harm and it definitely accomplishes what you were hoping in gaining its attention. In fact, it sort of— it's got its two arms, its two huge arms down in the water just trying to keep itself stable— after you hit it, it kind of rears backwards, and one of those arms flings upward and throws just an enormous ball of water at you with tremendous force that plows into you and knocks you backwards, just out of the water. You were standing kind of in the shallows, and you take two harm. Actually, probably—
Travis: Well, thank goodness because with my armor, I take one harm.
Griffin: Yeah, I think your vest, like, glistens with that shimmering red thread as the water hits you and protects you, and you only take one harm. Let's do Duck next.
Justin: Where's like the ball of light? Can I detect it currently?
Griffin: You cannot. As we've sort of established in the past, if the ball of light is surrounded by too much water, it is sort of invisible to you.
Justin: Okay. I want to go away from Aubrey and away from Ned to like, just distract in yet another direction.
Griffin: Mkay, like to the side of the pool?
Justin: To the side of the pool, exactly.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: That's exactly what I was thinking. So Duck, I think, is gonna like half-climb down the ladder into the pool. I'm imagining it's right— he's right about there.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And just like, take out Beacon and sort of futilely slash at the pool, just like ""Is this anything? Is this doing something? Is this— is this an attack?""
Griffin: If you did that, you could definitely reach like, one of its arms.
Justin: Perfect.
Griffin: Just 'cause this thing is pretty broad and you would definitely be able to reach it hanging off the ladder on the side of the pool.
Justin: Right. Then that— that's what I'm doing. I take out Beacon and slash at one of the arms. While hanging off the ladder.
Griffin: Okay, roll to Kick Some Ass.
Justin: I will roll to kick the proverbial ass.
Clint: Ooh!
Travis: Hell yeah!
Griffin: Holy shit, that is an 11 for the roll, plus tough.
Justin: Plus two tough, so 13.
Griffin: Plus one for the waves. So that's—
Justin: Fourteen! [Crosstalk]
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Your roll...
Travis: You kick its whole ass and its asshole.
Justin: I kick its entire ass.
Clint: And you got a little taint in there too!
Travis: Oh no.
Griffin: Gross. So choose a benefit from the list. You can gain an advantage or grant it to somebody else, do terrible harm, suffer less harm, or force them where you want them.
Justin: I am going to give one forward to Ned.
Griffin: All right, so Ned will have two forward on his attack.
Clint: Woo!
Justin: And that's two harm, right?
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Okay, so you deal two harm. Describe what this like, looks like.
Justin: Duck's kind of hanging off of the side, and he pulls out Beacon, and I think that when he pulls Beacon out it's coiled, and as he's swinging, Beacon unfurls, which catches the monster off guard. You know, they aren't prepared for it. They didn't really think they were gonna be in danger, and then Beacon unfurled at the last moment and just like, slices through the arm.
Griffin: That's sick, yeah, the arm—
Justin: It's cool. The other thing I will say is we gotta start naming these bad boys, or else it's going to a lot of like ""the monster."" They have names. They have hearts and souls, right?
Travis: Aqualung. What about Aqualung?
Justin: Aqualung is what it is called, now. Excellent.
Griffin: Okay, Aqualung swings one of its arms at you as it sees you kind of vulnerable hanging off the side of the pool. And as you unfurl Beacon, it tries to just pound you against the wall, and your sword just vivisects the arm, and the water sort of harmlessly sprays around you off to each side. But it sort of loses its balance and just kind of collides into you, kind of crushing you up against the wall of the pool. You take two harm as you sort of are crushed, and then the continual force of this thing falling into you pushes you backwards out of the pool, which if memory serves is actually zero harm because you're a tough boy.
Justin: Yes, I'm a tough boy.
Griffin: Ned, they have teed you up real nice.
Clint: First of all, Ned runs over to the other side of the pool, opposite from Duck. So we're basically hitting from three different sides.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: And he climbs up on the lifeguard stand so he has an elevation, little bit of an elevation—
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: And he's not in the actual water, which he does not want to be in, takes aim towards the base of Aqualung, where it's flowing up from the actual wave pool. Ned's gonna shoot it with the NARF Blaster, surprise surprise.
Griffin: Okay, go ahead and roll to Kick Some Ass.
Clint: That is a 10.
Justin: [deep] Oh yeahh.
Clint: Plus, nothing for tough, three forwards correct?
Griffin: Yeah, so that's a 13 total.
Clint: So 13, so Ned nimbly climbs up the lifeguard stand.
[Justin giggles]
Travis: Who's Ned Nimbly?
Clint: Ned Nimbly! He's Aqualung's buddy. Ned ""Nimbly"" Chicane climbs up the lifeguard stand, kind of hooks his feet in like, the armrest, cradles the NARF Blaster on his hip and pulls the trigger and yells:
Ned: Say hello to my spongy friend!
Clint: And fires.
Griffin: The glowing dart comes flying out of it and hits it at the base— oh, choose a bonus effect please.
Clint: The extra harm.
Griffin: So that's gonna be three harm. With that, the dart comes flying in and hits the elemental at sort of the base of its trunk where it was connected to the water, and you just cut completely clean through it. This figure, which was still kind of reeling from fucking up the attack against Duck, just sort of collapses down into the water, just losing its form completely. And you probably have a brief moment of relief, thinking ""I just dunked on Aqualung,"" and then... I think in lieu of just doing the harm back to you, I'm going to set up a soft move. All of the water now doesn't have this humanoid form in it anymore, but the water of the pool starts gathering towards the side of the pool that is facing Ned. And it starts raising up out of the water, forming this huge wall of water that threatens to come crashing down to just royally fuck up your whole shop. That is the situation, and we get back to Aubrey. Aubrey, Ned is about to get smooshed. What do you do?
Travis: So Aubrey flings out her hand and says:
Aubrey: Ned, look out!
Travis: And instinctually uses some magic.
Griffin: Okay...
Travis: So that is nine, and Aubrey instinctually bars a— let me see what the actual terminology is, bar a place or pert— portal to a specific person or type of creature.
Griffin: Okay. Let's do this: you reach out your hand and yell to warn Ned, and you feel something stirring inside of you.
[{19:42} Opening from “The Water Confronted” fades in]
Griffin: It feels like when you've, you know, cast your fireballs and lit up fireplaces all cool and done your fiery tricks in the past, but there's something different about this feeling. And time seems to slow down.
[Another World builds and fades out]
Griffin: Aubrey, we see you, and you're back in your childhood home several years ago. As you've kind of talked about before, it was sort of a palatial estate. It was a testament to the comfortable upbringing that you received due to your family's wealth. And yet, despite the luxuries afforded to you in this place, you are leaving it tomorrow. You are going to set out to follow your dream to become a famous stage magician, the Lady Flame. And you are seated at the dinner table with your mother and father. He's prepared you your favorite meal for your last evening at home. What is that? What is Aubrey's favorite meal?
Travis: You know...Like a really good, like, fig and pear and bleu cheese salad. [crosstalk] Something like that.
Griffin: Okay. It's your favorite meal?
Travis: More and more, I was gonna say steak, but we just had that whole fleather conversation, so...
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Sure, this is a very cruelty-free world that we've created here.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: So your favorite meal is here, and you're all enjoying it, but the air around the room is kind of uneasy. And after nearly completing the meal without a single word spoken over the table, your mom says:
Mrs. Little: So you all packed up kiddo?
Aubrey: Yeah.
Griffin: She says,
Mrs. Little: Are you sure you don't want to leave Nougat here with us?
Griffin: And she gestures towards a baby rabbit eating from a small dish at your side. And she says:
Mrs. Little: I don't know if it's such a good idea for him to go, you know, traveling around the country, he's just a baby.
Aubrey: Okay, A) how can I do magic without my assistant? And B) His name is not Nougat. That's— that's what his name was at the store because they did not appreciate the work that he had put into in receiving his doctorate. His name is Dr. Harris Bonkers, Ph.D., thank you very much mother.
Griffin: She smiles and says,
Mrs. Little: Of— of course, I'm so sorry.
Griffin: And then there's another couple minutes of silence as you all finish your meal. And then your father clears his throat, and he says:
Mr. Little: [Clears throat] I'm— I'm sorry, but is there a time limit on this plan of yours?
Aubrey: What— what do you mean?
Mr. Little: Like if you don't... you know, make it? Within a year, do you think you would come back home to us or?
Aubrey: N— no? Why wouldn't I make it? What does ""making it"" mean you know? I— no, no. I'm... if I come back, it'll be to visit, or to— no, I'm leaving.
Griffin: He sighs, and he says,
Mr. Little: I... I've just— we've spent your whole life trying to be as supportive as we could, Aubrey, trying to give you the kind of life we never got. But I don't know how to support you on this, Aubrey, with your grades you could get into any school in the country. Leaving to do magic is such a waste of that, and it's so— it's so dangerous, Aubrey, we're not gonna know where you are most of the time.
Aubrey: Listen, I'm gonna be fine. And the fact of the matter is, I don't want to go to school, and it's just not for me. It's— this is not just what I want. It's what I feel like I'm meant to do. It just feels right, you know? Like when I'm performing, when I'm doing my act, that's me, you know what I mean? Lady Flame is me. Aubrey feels like stage name, and Lady Flame is the only time it feels right.
Griffin: He stands up from the table suddenly, and he looks dejected and he picks up his plate and his silverware and starts to walk into the kitchen and he says,
Mr. Little: I'm sorry.
Griffin: And he leaves to room to start cleaning up. And it's later that evening, and you and Dr. Harris Bonkers are in bed. You had some trouble falling asleep that night, and your door creaks open. And in the moonlight, you see your mother enter the room, and she sits down beside you in the bed and picks up Dr. Harris Bonkers, who she pets affectionately in her lap, and she says,
Mrs. Little: That was a bit cliche, wasn't it?
[Travis laughs softly]
Aubrey: Yeah, little bit.
Griffin: She says:
Mrs. Little: We both love you unconditionally, you know that right?
Aubrey: There is a difference between knowing it and feeling it sometimes? I know it, but I also feel like a disappointment to Dad. I wish— like it would be a lot easier if I wanted to go to school. It would be a lot simpler.
Griffin: She says,
Mrs. Little: I— I get it. There's just... there's an ugly part of parenthood, Aubrey. A selfish part that rears its head sometimes. You convince yourself that you've invested your mind and your body and your soul and heart into your child, you work so hard for them during the part of their lives that they share with you, even before their lives sometimes. We went through a lot just trying to conceive you, which... sorry you probably don't want to hear about that. Sometimes that manifests with a feeling of betrayal for us like it did downstairs. And I'm truly sorry that that happened your last night with us.
Aubrey: It's just— I don't understand why this is the thing, right? Like you guys have always been so supportive of me when I wanted to dye my hair, you know, at thirteen you guys didn't care. And like, dressing however I want you don't care. You don't care, you know, who I choose to date, and that has never been a problem. I thought that this would be exciting, you know? Like, I'm gonna make a name for myself as the Lady Flame, and I just— I don't know why this is the thing that Dad just can't seem to get behind.
Mrs. Little: It's that you'll be gone, Aubrey. But you're— I get it. You're about to go on a grand adventure the likes of which every person during their life should be lucky enough to embark on, and... the thing is, with the exception of our furry friend here, you're gonna go alone. And I understand why it has to be this way, but... Okay, I have something for you, something to keep us, you know, in your heart, even when you're away.
Griffin: And she unclasps the necklace that she's wearing, and a beam of moonlight catches it perfectly refracting red light back up onto your face. And she says,
Mrs. Little: We have lots of jewelry in this house, Aubrey, but no piece is as precious to me as this. My mother gave it to me when I left home, as did her mother before her, and her mother before her for generations. It's kept our family safe through unspeakable hardships. Some of your more imaginative ancestors gave it a name: Flamebright.
Griffin: And she scratches her neck, and she says:
Mrs. Little: I haven't taken this thing off in nearly 25 years, Aubrey. A doctor tried to remove it when I was in labor with you, and I bit him. I bit him good.
[Travis and Clint laugh a little]
Mrs. Little: I was— I was pretty doped up at the time, but I like to think I knew what I was doing. I was keeping it safe because one day I knew I would be giving it to my daughter on a very important night to remind her that she is and always will be loved.
Griffin: And she gives you a tearful hug and slips it on over your neck, and it hangs down nearly to your navel. And your mom smiles and she says:
Mrs. Little: I tell you what, I'll go take some links out and shorten the chain, and maybe we can try this little ceremony again in the morning.
Aubrey: Sounds good, thank... I love you Mom.
Griffin: She says,
Mrs. Little: I love you too.
Griffin: And she walks out of the room. Later we see you asleep in the dead of night, your entire family having retired after an emotional evening.
[Opening of “The Water Confronted” fades in]
Griffin: And then we see a car, an Imperial Crown Coupe, pull up just in front of your house with its lights off, with two figures silhouetted from within.
[Music swells and fades out]
And then we're back in the present, and what do you do?
Travis: So when her hand flings out as this thing is about to crash onto the lifeguard stand, I'm just picturing it kind of like, hitting almost an invisible barrier, like you know a [makes invisible barrier noise?? ""wom wom wom wom wom""] in the air. You know what I mean? Just kind of stopping it from hitting Ned. I would say that it is kind of a, like, blast of wind stopping it from hitting, so like blowing it backwards, you know what I mean? And I think, with it being water, it looks awesome.
Griffin: Yeah, okay so, Ned, you actually feel— you see this wall of water about to come crashing down on you, and then you feel this like gale-force wind at your back that blows forward. And just as this water's about to crash down, this wall of wind curves upward and catches it in the air, and it just starts peeling away at the water, just throwing it effortlessly backwards into the pool, creating almost like a reverse pipeline. And not a single drop gets on you as the wall of water is turned away. And with that, the elemental Aqualung, I guess, splashes back down into the pool and kind of just thrashes there. The water's just thrashing, just furious at its failure. And then Ned, you, from your position, you see that faint yellow light on the surface of the water, still kind of fighting against the waves, and it dives downward into a drain at the bottom of the pool and disappears out of sight, attempting to make its escape.
Ned: Duck! The drain! Your sparkly yellow friend just ducked down into it, ironically enough.
Aubrey: Did you guys see what I did?!
Duck: All right, two things, just taking it in order, uh. Aubrey, that was radical, first off.
Aubrey: Thank you!
Duck: Let me say that.
Justin: I yell out:
Duck: Pigeon, he's making a run for it!
Griffin: In the woods, we see a— a section of chain-link fence boxing in a series of pipes, just sort of like making a U shape in and out of the ground with a large sort of hex bolt valve at the center of them. And there, we see Pigeon, and she has a huge wrench that she kind of nods and yells:
Pigeon: Yup!
Griffin: And throws the wrench onto the hex bolt and turns it. And then is kind of knocked backwards as a force sort of slams against the closed valve, rattling the pipes. And then it tries that a few more times, and you hear Pigeon say:
Pigeon: Yeah that pissed it off pretty good!
Aubrey: Duck, who's that?
Duck: Yeah, that's Pigeon.
Ned: Is everybody in your world named after birds?
Aubrey: This is a very good question. Also, why is Pigeon here?
Duck: Pigeon's helping us out a little bit. Sort of a... contractor.
Aubrey: Okay?
Duck: Hey listen, is personnel sort of the top pri [priority] right now [crosstalk]
Aubrey: [crosstalk] No, you're right, yep yep yep yep.
Duck: Or do we wanna? Okay, good good good good good good good good.
Griffin: The pipes beneath you underground in the park creak again, louder and longer than before. You all actually feel slight tremors beneath your feet, which causes the windows in the main office to just shatter from the vibration. There's a tower of maps next to an info desk that just topples over, and then silence falls over the park once again. And you all hear the sound of water lapping against cement, this time, from the lazy river surrounding the park.
[“The Water, Confronted” fades in]
You all see a mound of water lift off a few feet from the river traversing its path around the park, gaining speed as it moves. And that mound lifts higher and higher from the water, growing slowly as it collects all the water in its path. And then this form splashes downward, and suddenly launches up and out of the river's path with every drop of water from the river following it, forming a massive snakelike form that is barreling towards your party at ramming speed. Duck, what do you do?
Justin: Is it sort of— is it still serpentine? Is it coming sort of straight at us, or?
Griffin: Now it's just charging right at you like a train.
Justin: Alright, Duck extends Beacon in front of him, point first, and just starts sprinting at it.
Griffin: Mmkay.
Justin: Yeah, it's just gonna try to skewer it. I don't have a better plan.
Griffin: I think as you get close, you actually see in the head of this thing the yellow light as you are just sort of several feet away from it, about to collide. I guess roll to Kick Some Ass.
Justin: Yeah, I guess man. I was thinking about chickening out, but I think he's just kind of thinking on instinct at this point. Yeah, that roll to kick the proverbial ass is— do we still have advantage or have we lost that now?
Griffin: You do not, this thing is not in the wave pool anymore.
Justin: All right. Oofa doofa!
Griffin: That's a— that's a double snake eyes I guess for a big nasty four.
Justin: That's a big nasty four! Whew!
Griffin: Plus [crosstalk] for tough?
Travis: [Crosstalk] Well that's an experience.
Justin: Oh, yeah plus two for tough.
Griffin: Still is a six, which is a failure. Go ahead and mark experience.
Justin: I've learned something from this.
[Clint laughs]
Justin: This is a good experience for— you know what, honestly I'd rather have the experience. It's a good experience. Okay, so I guess I'm... sprinting at it, just like ""AAAAH"" with Beacon extended, and I think there's a moment just before we collide where Beacon sort of like, almost half-whispers like,
Beacon: Duck Newton... This is going to go poorly.
[Travis laughs]
Justin: And then they collide.
Griffin: The snake, which is just barreling at you, you are not harmed by it ramming into you with this like tremendous amount of force. It kind of opens up as it is about to collide with you and just kind of like envelops you and catches you in the form of this snake, and Ned and Aubrey, you now see Duck flying backwards back into the rear of this snake shape, just twisting around helplessly in the water. It whips up its tail at the last second and you are launched violently out of the form of this snake. And now Ned and Aubrey, you see Duck just ragdolling through the air just 20 feet high, sailing away and out of sight back towards the corner of the park and down into the reservoir at the back corner of the park. And Duck, you're just barely able to hold on to your senses as your arc turns back toward the ground. You see the reservoir just flying towards you, [“The Water, Confronted” fades in] and you also see the metal bridge spanning the reservoir's circumference which you fly closer and closer to, and then your head collides with its guard rail with a sickening thump.
You remember a night from decades ago. You have woken up with a start in your childhood bedroom, just doused in sweat. You take a moment to collect yourself and your senses one by one sort of flicker back to life, and that is when you smell smoke. It is pouring into your bedroom through the crack under your bedroom door, through which you can see dancing orange light pulsating in from the hallway. You hear a furious crackling noise from beyond that door. You do not, however, hear the smoke alarm. What do you do?
Justin: I— I go to the door. I— I’m trying to remember, like, my—
Griffin: [crosstalk] The Red Cross, like, fire safety—
Justin: Yeah, exactly. I think— Do I have any—
Travis: [crosstalk] You’ve gotta check with the back of your hand.
Justin: Do I have any— yeah, that— right, exactly.
Clint: [crosstalk] Stop, drop, and roll! Don’t forget to stop, drop, and roll!
Justin: I’m not currently on fire. [Clint: Oh.] Am I on ground level, and is there a window?
Griffin: You are on the second story of the house. [Justin: Eugh.] There is a window.
Justin: I kick the door.
Griffin: Ok. The door just, like, easily gives way as you kick it. Actually, you are surprised by how easily it gives way. You are sort of surprised by the strength you muster as you just effortlessly boot the door open. You see the sort of lock mechanism, the actual doorknob interior part of the doorknob, just come completely off the door and come out into the hallway. And a blast of searing hot air hits you in the face, and you see the hallway of your family house just up in flames. The fire is climbing up the walls, engulfing rows of framed photos of your family hung there. A burning beam has fallen through the ceiling, cutting off the rest of the hallway that’s leading to your parents’ bedroom, the door to which is still closed. And you also notice that, on the other end of this hallway, leading downstairs and into the living room, there is no fire. Your path leading out of the house is free and open to you, should you choose to use it.
Justin: What about the door to my little sister’s room?
Griffin: That is across the hallway from your parent’s bedroom. That door, you can also see through the flames, is also closed.
Justin: All right. I grab a blanket off of my bed and I kind of drape it around myself [Griffin: Ok.] and I sprint through the fire towards, uh, Jane’s room.
Griffin: Ok. Roll to Act Under Pressure.
Justin: Isn’t it odd, conceptually, to roll during a flashback? I understand that we are doing this, but it just strikes me as weird.
Travis: ‘Cause, listen, it either happened or it didn’t, you know?
Justin: [crosstalk] It either did— it either happened or it didn’t, but it’s the immutable nature of fate, I suppose. So this would be...I rolled an eight, I have a two to Cool, which would make it a ten.
Griffin: Okay! You set out to do what you want to do. So there’s this burning beam sort of cutting off the rest of the hallway between you and the bedrooms of your sister and your parents. How do you— what does it look like as you get around that?
Justin: I— I think I just jump over it. And maybe I’m, like— that’s instinctual, and I’m kind of surprised, like, oh, shit! Wow, I really cleared that. ‘Cause, like, I wasn’t big into sports or anything. [Griffin: Yeah.] I haven’t really like put my body to the test, or anything.
Griffin: Yeah, you like sort of effortlessly contort your body into this shape as you kind of dive, covered in this blanket, just clean over this beam that has fallen down at a diagonal into the hall, and do a perfect roll as you land and come to your feet just surprised at what a badass you are right now. What do you do?
Justin: I smash open the door to Jane’s room and— I’m screaming, also, to try to wake everybody up, but I smash open the door to Jane’s room to make my way over to grab her.
Griffin: The walls and ceiling of this room are just completely engulfed. Burning embers are raining down from above. One lands on your forearm as you kick this door open and you feel it singe your skin before sort of reflexively shaking it off. And the bed in front of you is occupied by a shape that is completely covered by the blankets, seemingly still unconscious despite the sort of immediate danger posed to them by this blazing bedroom.
Justin: I throw off the blanket and scoop her up. She’s, uh, seven, so it’s not too tough. I scoop her up and gra— take the blankets with me so I can cover both of us on the way out.
Griffin: Ok. As you scoop her up and sort of wrap her in the blanket that was on her bed, another two beams fall through the ceiling inside the room right in front of the door back out into the hallway, cutting off your exit. And with this she kind of comes to, and starts coughing, and she says,
Jane: [weakly] Duck? What’s goin’ on?
Duck: It’s alright, Jane, just close your eyes and try to breathe real shallow, ok?
Jane: O— ok.
Justin: I grab her TV/VCR combo that she has there, little 12-inch job, and I chuck it at the window as hard as I can.
Griffin: It’s like picking up like a, like an empty cardboard box. It is, the weight is nothing to you, as you lift up the TV/VCR combo and throw it through the window. And it smashes apart, and— the heat from this room is incredible, but as you smash open the window, you feel an even more powerful heat coming from outside, and there’s a flash of light and it takes a moment for your eyes to adjust and when it does, you see outside, and there’s the sun.
It’s not hanging in its usual place in the sky {Another World starts}, it looks like it’s just mere miles away from the surface of the earth, just occupying the entirety of the horizon. And in the distance, you see a white beam of light shooting upward from the surface of the earth, traveling all the way up and into this nearby sun. And you see everything around the base of this beam just getting sucked up into it— trees and cars and houses and the earth itself, all travelling up the beam to be destroyed by this massive ball of fire in the sky. And as you gaze up on this scene, the gravitational pull of the beam gets stronger, pulling in more and more of the earth until your house starts coming apart, and you feel yourself flying upward, into this beam, into the sun.
And then you wake up in your bed again. {music fades out} And standing at the foot of your bed, watching over you intently, is a humanoid shape made out of faint translucent light, and a voice comes from it and says,
Minerva: I apologise for the rude awakening, Duck Newton! If you must take a moment to collect yourself before speaking, I completely understand!
Duck: I— what the fuck?
[laughter]
Minerva: My name is Minerva, Duck Newton, and I—
Duck: [screaming] Aaaahhhhhh!!
Justin: I jump through her, throw open the door, do not kick it, I’m not that out of it— I throw open the door to, like, check for fire.
Griffin: Nope, nothing is amiss. You actually see Jane open the door, deeper down the hallway, and she kind of peeks out and rubs her eyes and says,
Jane: Duck, are you ok?
Duck: Go back to bed, goofus, there’s nothing going on. It’s fine.
Griffin: She kind of, like, gives you a— a sneer, like, “Okay, you don’t have to call me goofus,” and dips back into her bedroom, and Minerva, from behind you, says,
Minerva: If you’re quite done, I must tell you that you have been chosen to fulfill a fate of cosmic importance!
Duck: Yeah, but what the fuck? Who are you? What are you doing in my room?
Minerva: My name is Minerva, Duck Newton, and I am here to tell you you’ve been chosen to fulfill a fate of cosmic importance!
Duck: All right, first off, who the hell are you? I know you’re not a friend of my mom, ‘cause you’re calling me Duck, and I know she hates that. So that— that’s— you’re not a friend of my mom. Who are you, who sent you? Is this a— [comprehending] Aahh, ok. This is computers. I’ve been hearing people talk about that, the AV club, they’re saying a lot of stuff about computers and all the stuff they can do. You’re computers, aren’t you?
[Clint laughing]
Travis: This is— by the way, this is tripping me the fuck out, because the voice Justin is doing right now sounds like 15-year-old Justin—
Griffin: It’s very good.
Travis: It’s tripping me out.
Justin: Now am I— now I’m in my head about it.
[laughter]
Griffin: She says,
Minerva: I am not computers, Duck Newton! I come from a faraway place, you’re not ready quite yet to understand that. But you must understand, Duck Newton, and this will be difficult news to hear— your world is imperilled, Duck Newton. It is besieged by a supernatural threat that would spell certain doom for not just your planet, but for two planets that have found themselves linked by destiny itself. Even now, horrific abominations march on your world, threatening to destroy the lives of your neighbours, friends, and loved ones without hesitation or remorse. The forces your world have assembled to defend itself will prove insufficient to see to this threat. You have been called, Duck Newton, to do what they cannot.
Duck: What’s that?
Minerva: To f— to fight. To fight them.
Duck: Yeah.
Minerva: Do not fear fighting them, though, Duck Newton. You will be imbued with the strength of ancients to see to this task. Outfitted with the mightiest armaments in existence, and trained by one of the greatest warriors this universe has ever known, which is me.
{Another World fades in}
Griffin: And this figure extends its hand outward to you.
Duck: Yeah, I got class tomorrow, though.
{music fades out}
Griffin: And then we are back in the present, and we see Duck Newton, unconscious, sinking to the bottom of this deep reservoir as his vision dictates. Next in the order is...Ned!
Ned: Aubrey, listen, I’m the only one that can hurt that thing, I’m the only one that can keep it distracted. You need to go rescue Duck. I’ll shoot it a bunch with the Narf blaster—
Aubrey: Ok!
Travis: And she’s running towards the reservoir.
Ned: [calling after her] And then you’ll come right back and help me, right?
Aubrey: [yelling] What?
Ned: Well, shit.
Griffin: What are you— Ned, this thing kind of— it stopped for a moment, as it did its little maneuver to chuck Duck through the air— oh, that’s fun, “chuck Duck.” But now it turns back towards you as you are yelling to Aubrey to come back when she’s done saving Duck’s life, and it starts moving and picking up speed as it moves towards you. What do you do?
Clint: I’m going to do what Ned does best, and that’s run away. [Griffin: Okay.] But as Ned is running, he’s going to basically, you know, just fire away with the Narf Blaster, just kind of raking along the body of the water snake, just to try to distract it and keep it away from Aubrey and Duck, and at the same time, running away is a big component in this.
Griffin: Okay. Since you are shooting it, I think still Kicking Some Ass is the way to go.
Clint: [laughing] And that’s a 12!
Griffin: That is double sixes, folks.
Clint: I have zero Tough.
Griffin: All right! So pick your bonus effect. I think it sounds like, based on the maneuver that you said, if you want to, like, keep this in the rules of the game, you force them where you want—
Clint: I think that would be, cause I wanted to— I wanted to cha— I wanted to move away from Duck and Aubrey.
Griffin: All right. Describe what this looks like.
Clint: Ned says,
Ned: Shhhhhit!
Clint: And just starts firing away, just shot after shot, while he runs, he’s kind of leaning backwards, shooting at the snake along the length of its watery body, and basically heading towards one of the big water slides, just away from them.
Griffin: Here’s what happens. You do this sick dodge roll out of the way and the snake rolls past you, and now you’re sort of running parallel alongside it as it continues its trajectory past you, just firing bolt after bolt into its side. It takes 2 harm, and one of the bolts, I think, hits it close to its head, and as that happens, you see the snake form, just for a moment, kind of spasm, and a bunch of water sort of shoots out of the side of it, almost like it had this surface tension containing all of it that it just sort of loses at a few points, and water just spills out of it. And you manage to get past it, but it does a quick u-turn, you know, 30 feet behind you, and then starts chasing you towards the water slides.
The water slides at the back of the park, there are three main, large water slides. They are all built into the same tall wooden tower, with staircases leading up it, with a line sort of separated into three parts where people, you know, wait in line and then get to the slide that they want to go on and disembark from there. But it’s all part of this one central structure, and you run towards that direction.
And it is gaining on you and gaining on you, and right as you hit the pool at the base of this water slide structure, it finally catches up to you and collides with you, knocking you forward. The tremendous force, though, of this thing just barrelling to you, hits you and knocks you into the water for 2 harm. And it continues its path and sort of travels over you as you are now in the pool, not unconscious like your friend Duck but sort of dazed from the force of the impact. And as you look upwards, you see the snake start to lift up and away from the surface of the pool, and it begins to climb this wooden tower, this tower of slides.
And then you see the water from the pool that you’re actually in start streaming upwards, like a, like a sink faucet that’s been left on, and it’s pouring water upward and out of the pool. And then you see a few more appear, and then dozens more, until like a hundred streams of water are pouring upward as this snake starts coiling around this wooden tower, just twisting all around it, weaving between the stairwells leading to its peak, and soon the water from the pool floats up and joins it, and now it’s no longer a snake coiled around this wooden tower of slides. Now it is just a mountain of water, just completely engulfing the whole structure.
You can see sort of silhouetted from the floodlights shining into this mountain of water from behind, you see pieces of the slides start to break apart. {50:38 music fades in} You see a set of stairs from this wooden tower get torn off the structure completely, and all this debris is just sort of revolving around inside of this huge mountain of water, like they’re caught in a whirlpool. The water in the pool has drained out from around you, you are now sitting at the bottom of this empty pool at the base of the structure. And a piece of one of the slides, just this gigantic section of black pipe comes flying out of the mountain and it lands with a crash just a few feet in front of you, bouncing a few times before rolling to a stop at your feet. And you can tell that the elemental is panicked and wounded, but now also it is armed. {music fades out}
Aubrey, you are up.
Travis: So, Aubrey’s sprinting over to the reservoir. [Griffin: Ok.] How far is it?
Griffin: It’s not too far, there’s a chainlink fence between you and the water. Although I assume, actually, there is a gate with a padlock on it for easy access to park employees.
Travis: Okay. I’m going to do an— can I do another instinctive magic?
Griffin: Yeah, for sure!
Travis: Ok. So Aubrey is going to climb the fence, is her plan. [Griffin: Okay.] And so, like, she’s kind of running and goes to do like a running jump at the fence. Rolled a ten, plus two, yeah, and I’m going to say that’s like a gust of wind as she goes.
Griffin: Ok, sick, yeah. A— you’re running and you leap, and you feel this emotion of you want to defend your friend, you want to save your friend, and that sort of creates, if you will, a literal wind beneath your wings as you leap, and the wind sort of also catches you as you fall to the ground, and you just sort of keep speed as you hop effortlessly over the fence.
Travis: [crosstalk] And she says out loud,
Aubrey: Thank you magic!
Travis: And just keeps running.
Griffin: Okay. Now what?
Travis: So when I get to the reservoir, what do I see?
Griffin: You can barely see, thanks to a floodlight shining down into the reservoir, you see Duck’s form. He is about twenty feet underwater. This is a deep, deep reservoir with this metal bridge sort of spanning across its center point.
Travis: Okay, well she’s going to jump in and, you know, grab him and pull him out.
Griffin: Okay. I think this would be another Act Under Pressure. Unless you want to use magic to somehow do some cool shit with the water to help you out.
Travis: Yeah, so like she, you know, same deal, takes a big deep breath, let’s say that’s what it is, big deep breath and once again finds that she’s able to stay underwater longer because of that, you know what I mean? Surprised at her ability to hold her breath. And I rolled a six, plus two, so an eight.
Griffin: Okay, it works imperfectly. Choose your effect and a glitch. The keeper will decide what effect the glitch has. So you want to do something beyond human limitations, you are using the wind to I guess fill your lungs? As you want to dive down and reach Duck. You have to choose a glitch from the list. Usually we don’t get these because you got those hot magic rolls, but—
Travis: Yeah. I’m going to say— I’m going to do the one harm, and say that it works, I can hold my breath, but it ends up, like, hurting my chest, you know?
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. You— it— most notably you take one harm, ignore armor. So you take this deep breath, and it’s kind of crazy deep, you take this huge inhale and as you do so, you feel actually a pretty terrible pain from inside your— from inside your chest, and I think you start feeling heart palpitations that kind of stop you in your tracks a little bit. Take one harm. However, you now have just what feels like endless breath as you dive into the water. Describe what happens next.
Travis: So yeah, she’s swimming through the— gotta grab that Duck, and she’s swimming trying to grab him by the back of his shirt, trying to pull him out of the water. So this is probably another Act Under Pressure, right?
Griffin: No, I think you’ve rolled enough on this turn that I would just give it to you. I think, actually, what you can do is, you actually feel the wind inside of your lungs make you buoyant, as you grab onto Duck by the scruff of his collar and pull him upwards, and you kind of just shoot upwards as the wind takes you to the surface of the water. And you pretty easily get Duck out of the reservoir. And with that, Duck, as you feel like the wind on your face, your head is just pounding. Did I make you take harm when you hit the bridge?
Justin: No, but it seems legit.
Griffin: I’m going to say— I mean, you fell two stories and cracked your head on the side of a bridge. I would say that’s pretty extreme damage. I would say that’s four harm, but you will— obviously that will be cushioned a bit by your natural armor. [Justin: Ok.] But as the wind hits your face, as you are pulled out of the pool, you regain consciousness. And there is Aubrey, kneeling over you, looking like she just has really bad gas, I guess?
[Travis laughing]
Justin: All right. The first thing she hears is,
Beacon: Congratulations new owner! My name is Beacon. My former owner has tragically died, but fear not—
Aubrey: Beacon, shut up! Duck, are you okay? Duck!
Duck: [mumbling] I got class tomorrow.
Aubrey: What? Duck!
Travis: And she smacks him.
Duck: Ok, alright, I’m here. What’s up?
Aubrey: A water snake thing flipped you— you hit your head on the reservoir— your— I jumped a fence?? It was sick.
Duck: I’m sorry I missed that.
Aubrey: And— yeah, I— sure I’ll do it again! We have to get back over, ‘cause Ned’s by himself, and that’s probably not going to go well. Are you cool?
Duck: Hey, real quick, though. The monster stuff is real, isn’t it?
Aubrey: Yeah?
Duck: I was kinda hoping it was a dream. Aw, man. Ah, well. I’m pretty banged up, but let’s get back over to Ned. How far away is he?
Griffin: He’s pretty far away. He led— he purposefully led the snake away from you all, so he is—
Clint: What a brave, brave man he is.
Griffin: He’s kind of on the opposite corner. You all are towards the back end of the park, but he’s in the other corner where the water slides are.
Justin: All right, I guess we’ll just start— I won’t say running, but, I mean— I think we have to start moving towards Ned. There’s a fence, right?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: I can probably slash through that with Beacon. [Clint: Ooohh!] I would like to speed things up a bit, cause I’m not jumping any fences right now. In fact, let me just say that.
Griffin: Okay. I don’t even think this would be a Kick Some Ass roll, because that’s for like, if you and the thing are going to do damage to each other—
Justin: Kick some fence’s ass!
Griffin: As funny as it would be, the image of this fence, you slashing it, and then it falling over onto you to deliver the death blow, I think you just slash through the chain link and open up a hole in the fence, and probably supported by Aubrey, the two of you start making your way over towards the slide structure that is engulfed in this mountain of water that Ned, you are currently at the foot of. And Ned, you climb to your feet at the base of this pool right in front of this mountain, and you see towards the peak, just sort of right at the surface of the water at the peak, probably 30 feet up, you see that yellow light, and it is glistening at the peak of this mountain of water above you. What do you do?
Clint: You know what, there comes a time in every coward’s life [Travis: Uh huh.] where you know the only— the only way you’re going to survive is by attacking back. In this case, maybe the best defense is a good offense. So what the shit, just— Ned has a strap that the Narf blaster is on, so he kind of flings it back so it’s hanging off his back, and he goes running— dives into the water, trying to climb up that wood framing.
Griffin: Okay, this is definitely going to be Act Under Pressure. You get inside this mountain of water, and the world around you just goes silent as you dive just straight forward. It’s not like a pool of water, it is a massive tower of water, and you just jump right into the side of it. And it takes a second for your eyes to adjust, but you see just huge pieces of lumber just swirling around, and you see a slide just get easily smashed apart by one of these huge pieces of lumber, and so all this stuff is just swirling around in the water towards you, and as you swim upward toward that light at the peak, you are sort of avoiding it as you go. So roll to Act Under Pressure.
Clint: Ha! Twelve!
Travis: Wow!
Griffin: Another double six??
Clint: And also add one for Cool, so that’s 13!
Justin: That can’t be right [laughing]. There’s no way.
Clint: Sorry, Ned has one Cool! He’s got zero Tough, but he’s got one Cool.
Griffin: All right. The scene is, you are swimming upwards, and easily avoiding these huge chunks of the tower that are flying all around you.
Travis: I’m going to say wherever Duck and Aubrey are, they just like stop and they’re like, “What the fuck?” as Ned’s just like, [makes “whooshing” sound to imitate Ned dodging pieces of timber]
Griffin: There are a series of floodlights shining into this mountain, and so you all can just kind of see the silhouettes of these pieces of tower and slide swirling around Ned’s form as he just doggy paddles upward into the sky, towards the peak of this mountain. I think at one point, a huge chunk of that same slide that landed at your feet earlier coming right towards you, and you just kind of plank your body and go completely through it as it flies in your direction {Another World fades in} and you are swimming and not sure if you’re going to be able to hold your breath long enough, and that light is getting closer and closer, and brighter and brighter.
{music fades out}
And then, Ned, you are standing in a dark room that you are not supposed to be in. It has been a week since the wreck that saw you and your partner in crime separated, which left him to an almost certainly unpleasant fate, and you’ve spent this week putting your distance between yourself and that scene, just as much distance as possible, mostly hitchhiking and walking down highways, probably discreetly trying to catch a bus, probably with a hood pulled up as you go. And you have found yourself in some podunk town where finally you can catch a breath. However, it’s kind of hard to do so when you are as cash strapped as you find yourself at the moment. And so you stop to find a few quick bucks the only way you know how: by taking it from someone else in the dead of night.
And so you went in the first seemingly unoccupied building that you came across in this town, this modest looking shop of some sort down by the river, by the entrance to town. There were no cars parked outside, and the location is far enough away from the rest of town that you figure you’d be in the clear if you wanted to poke around and see what you could burgle. So you jimmied open a window and you crept inside, and the moonlight through the open window highlights a few peculiar things in this room: some weird taxidermied animals that look like they’ve been sort of composited together using parts from multiple animals; there’s a pedestal with a large clay disk on it, which is pressed with what appears to be a large footprint; there is a wire rack tower with a bunch of maps to local tourist attractions; and toward the back of the room there is a desk, sitting on which is an old timey looking cash register. What do you do?
Clint: Well, Ned “Ninja” Chicane very quietly moves towards that cash register and opens it.
Griffin: Okay. I think there’s a lock, which you, you know, certainly have experience popping open, go ahead and roll to Act Under Pressure.
Clint: Seven, plus one, which is for Cool, so that’s eight.
Griffin: The register pops open and you see just an empty drawer inside as it pops out to greet you. And then you hear a shotgun cock from behind you, and hear a voice say,
Shop Owner: Well, all right, now, this is a— this is just a bad beat. He could have broken into any shop in this town and gotten away scot free, but you just had to pick the one place where the owner lives and sleeps on the premises. That’s just plain ol’ bad luck.
Ned: Not to mention the one broke place.
Shop Owner: [chuckles] Yeah. Don’t make any smart moves, by the way, I got you dead to rights, you’re just gonna stand there real still and we’re gonna have ourselves a little conversation, okay?
Ned: I’m a statue, my friend.
Shop Owner: What’s your name?
Ned: My name? Uh, Edward.
Shop Owner: You got a last name, Edward?
Ned: Edward, uh, Bonaventure.
Shop Owner: Okay. Yeah, that’s not real, but— what brings you to Kepler there, Mr. Edward?
Ned: The foul winds of— of fate, my new friend. Little down on my luck, need a grub steak and I was looking for perhaps something I could be— I could borrow, with every intention of paying back, with interest, to whoever was the kind soul who would help me in my dire hour of need.
Griffin: You hear her laugh this just sort of joyous, kind of croaky laugh, and flips on a light switch, and there you see an older woman, you’d guess probably in her 70s. She is wearing some pajamas, she has an eyepatch, and she is holding a shotgun that she has pointed in your direction. And she smiles this big, toothy grin, and says,
Shop Owner: I find that pretty— oh my god, that’s a nasty bruise you got there on your forehead! How’d you get something like that?
Ned: It’s a little foggy, I’m not quite sure. I believe I hit my head on a window casing, but I’m not 100% sure.
Griffin: She says,
Shop Owner: Well, you may want to get that looked at. So—
Ned: Yeah, I don’t really have health insurance, and I’m pretty sure that if I go to a doctor, they’re going to ask me the same intrusive questions that you’re asking, like ‘how did it happen’, and I’m not prepared to go there at this time. And your name is…?
Victoria: My name is Victoria. There, Ned, it’s a pleasure to meet you, sorry it’s not under better circumstances.
Ned: Yes, I’m— I as well.
Victoria: So what made you decide to relieve this little here monster museum of its riches, huh?
Ned: The apparent lack of a security system, which it now appears that I was really off base, since you seem to be the security system.
Victoria: Yeah, it’s just more damn bad luck, I’m afraid there, Edward.
Ned: Well, I have a lot of it.
Griffin: And she says,
Victoria: Also, as you can see, ain’t nothing green been in that register save for a little bit of weed, for the better part of a year now.
Ned: Ooh!
Victoria: It’s medicinal, for my legs.
Ned: [crosstalk] Of course, yes, everything is medicinal.
Victoria: [crosstalk] It’s for my legs.
Ned: What exactly— if you don’t mind me asking, since the only other topic so far has been shooting me— what is this place?
Victoria: Well, this here is a wonderland of supernatural delights, there, Edward. It’s called the Cryptonomica. It’s my little museum, sort of my footprint here in Kepler. Lots of strange stuff happens around here. I’ve seen it, lived here my whole life, and seems that folks around here want to try to ignore it more than celebrate it. So I opened up this shop a few decades back, and—
Ned: Looks like they’re still ignoring it.
Griffin: She smiles, and she says,
Victoria: Yeah, as it turns out, folks here, they don’t want to address the reality of the situation, as I see it.
Ned: Of course.
Victoria: Don’t nobody in this town here like me, Edward, and don’t nobody in this town trust me. In fact, this is the first conversation I’ve had with another living person in weeks, and to be honest, it’s one of the more entertaining conversations I believe I have ever had.
Ned: Well, thank you, I think, Victoria. Would you mind just lowering that shotgun, just so it’s not pointed at the more vital parts of my body? I’m really— I’m really harmless, I’m strictly B&E. I do not do armed stuff, I don’t do anything with violence. I abhor violence. As a matter of fact my middle name is Pacifist. And so if you wouldn’t mind not pointing that at me in such a lethal manner…
Griffin: She says,
Victoria: Nah, I appreciate that you have a non-violent approach, ‘cause if you didn’t, you would be dead. I’ll tell you what, how about this: it’s late, and I’m tired, and you probably are too, guessin’ by that bruise on your head. Cash register is empty, but the fridge ain’t. Got some smoked turkey in there, you’re welcome to, maybe grab some ice for that noggin of yours while you’re at it. And, tell you what, there’s a cot in the supply room, back in the back you can use, you should use it, and then tomorrow morning maybe you can explain what it is you’re doing in this neck of the woods, maybe you can tell me your actual, real name, if the spirit moves you.
Ned: It’s Ned.
Victoria: Ned…?
Ned: Ned Chicane.
Victoria: Still get a feeling like that ain’t your real, Christian name, but—
Ned: That’s probably about the best we’re gonna do on such short notice, Victoria. Are you— let me ask you this. Are you sure you want to do that? I did, I mean, break into your hovel of a business.
Victoria: It ain’t a hovel, it’s a great business. Just cause we don’t get patrons don’t mean it’s not worthwhile.
Ned: It is charming, I must admit I find myself very comfortable here.
Griffin: She says,
Victoria: Yeah, I’m sure of it, Ned. And let me tell you, you ain’t got nothing to worry about, I’m not going to come back into that supply room and murder you in your sleep or nothing.
Ned: Thank God.
Victoria: Yeah, probably sounds spooky, the fact that I even had to say that at all, huh?
Ned: Yeah, a little bit.
Victoria: I guess it is maybe a bit strange for me to decide to open up my home to a burglar, but I got a peculiar set of beliefs.
Ned: Yes, I noticed.
Victoria: I’m letting you into my home, Ned, because {music fades in} you found your way here, and if living in Kepler for 70 years has taught me one thing, it’s that nothing happens in this town without a damn good reason.
{Another World swells, and then fades out}
Griffin: And then we are back in the present, and Ned, you dodge a few more pieces of debris, and now you can actually see the night sky through the surface of the water at its peak, and floating immediately in front of you is that yellow light, {music fades in} that as you approach it, you actually feel it starting to control the water, creating a current that is desperately, desperately trying to pull you back down. What do you do?
Clint: I think he’s gonna— this is the best time to take the shot. I think he’s going to have to take the shot.
Griffin: Roll to Kick Some Ass.
Clint: Ok. That’s a seven.
Griffin: You are point blank with this light. Rather, you were— it is trying to pull you away, and I think it’s sort of gaining some ground, and you desperately try to paddle against the current, and then just grab the Narf blaster [Clint: Yep.] and sort of twirl it around you on its strap, and let a dart fly.
Clint: Opens his mouth and yells out,
Ned: [garbled gurgling sound, like someone yelling underwater]
Griffin: And then, Aubrey and Duck, you see from outside Ned’s silhouette pull out the Narf blaster, and then you see, just for a moment, a sharp light leave Ned’s silhouette and enter the light at the peak of the water mountain.
{music fades out}
And then you see pieces of debris just start falling inside this mountain. Some of it falls out the side and tumbles down into the empty pool below, and then you see the water in this mountain just start to melt away. It just starts lowering down, down to the ground, losing its shape, dispersing back down into the pool, overflowing that pool, since it had some water from the river in it, too. And Ned, you see, right in front of you, the dart still sort of pushing up against the yellow light that was controlling everything, until finally, it pushes its way through and then this, this light, it starts to flash over and over and over again, and as it flashes, it almost looks like it’s growing into a new shape and colour. What you see floating in this water as you are descending down to the ground is what appears to be a humanoid being made out of white light {music fades in} about your size, with two legs and four arms, and a domed head, all made out of this gentle white light. And you actually see two small, black eyes appear on its face, and meet your gaze. And you instantly know that this being, whatever it is, it means you no harm.
And then finally the mountain disintegrates completely, and now you and this figure are just standing on the ground right outside of the pool, and you see this figure sort of look at its arms, one by one, just sort of examining its body, and as it does so, the light from one of its arms starts to break apart, just sort of disintegrating and floating away in the air, and in its last moments, this white humanoid shape, it looks back up in your direction, Ned, and then it slowly and cautiously nods, and then it evaporates completely in a cloud of soft, white particles of light, drifting upward and winking out of view one by one.
{music ends}
{{Ad Break, 1:13:16 - 1:19:05}}
{Amnesty theme}
Griffin: Duck, you have returned home to your apartment building after your successful hunt. It is pretty late, the lights in your neighbours windows are all out, only the flickering street lights outside shed some light onto your approach as you return for the night. And as you crest the top of the stairs to your second story apartment, you see a figure at your door. They are kneeling down, and they appear to be busying themselves with something that you can’t quite ascertain, right in front of the door into your apartment. What do you do?
Justin: I yell,
Duck: Hey, what the fuck?
Travis: Duck’s new catchphrase!
Justin: Duck’s new catchphrase! “Hey, what the fuck?”
Griffin: As you yell that, you startle this figure, who kind of falls down, and you hear like some objects hitting the floor. And as they turn to face you, you see the warm, craggy face of Leo Tarkesian, your next door neighbour and proprietor of the local general store, who you whipped into existence at the beginning of this arc with your beautiful brain. And he is knelt over your doormat, where he has left a couple of paper bags filled with groceries, which he is now trying to refill with some of the objects that he dropped as you yelled and startled him. And he smiles as you catch him in the act, and he says,
Leo: Ah, damn, Duck! I was hoping I could get the drop on you. How’s your night? It looks like it was maybe kind of a tough one.
Duck: Yeah, there was a— a— a black bear got— uh, fell into the river there, a baby, and I had to swim in and rescue it. ‘Cause they’re, you know, they’re keeping count now, trying to monitor the population.
Leo: Damn, Duck, you are a credit to the park service. I don’t know what they’d do without you there, saving bears from rivers, you big hero.
Duck: Yeah, uh. We all gotta do our part, I guess.
Griffin: He says,
Leo: You haven’t stopped by the store in a while, so I figured you might be running low on sundries, so I thought I’d swing by and leave you some supplies, keep you fed, just, you know, try to be a good neighbour over here. You’re out there saving bears, seems like the least I can do.
Duck: Did you, uh— did you get in that new Wild Berry Froot Loops? I’ve been hearing some good things.
Griffin: He pulls out a box of Wild Berry Froot Loops—
[Travis laughs]
Duck: My dude. My dude, thank you.
Leo: I know, I— yeah, I know what you need. How else— how’s the rest of the forest stuff going? I admit I haven’t been out hiking lately, on account of my back. Is it still as, you know, pristine and verdant as ever?
Duck: Yeah, Mr. Tarkesian, I mean the splendor is all still in place. I— it’s a little more demanding lately to keep— keep the peace, as it were.
Leo: Well, you make sure to take care of yourself there, Duck, I can’t have you starving in the cold just cause you got too busy serving the needs of the community to take care of yourself. You need anything— you need anything at all— you just come knock on my door, all right?
Duck: Yeah. Hey, Mr. Tarkesian— I know you always leave your place unlocked. You, uh— start locking up, ok?
Leo: Yeah, I can do that. It’s a little bit— sounds a bit nefarious there, Duck.
Duck: You know, it’s just been some strange, uh. It’s just some strange times.
Griffin: He says,
Leo: All right, I’ll take care of myself if you take care of yourself, Duck. Does that sound like a fair trade?
Duck: Yeah, thanks for the Loops.
Griffin: You and Mr. Tarkesian go to open your doors, and he turns the knob into his apartment and he stops and he turns to you and he says,
Leo: You got good form, by the way. I seen you in the lot back behind the building, practicing with that sword. I figured you were prepping for a Ren Fair, or something like that. You look good, real professional! That kick thing that you’re doing is top-notch.
Duck: Yeah, I’m, uh. This is going to sound stupid, but I’ve been kicking around the idea of finally getting involved with the community theater. You know, the big fight scene in Romeo and Juliet, when all the—
Leo: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, sure.
Duck: [crosstalk] When the two families are going at it—
Leo: Love it, yeah.
Duck: I’m trying to learn some real basic stuff. I don’t know, it’s kind of silly. Thanks for not telling anybody about it, though, I appreciate it. I’m a little— little embarrassed, not even sure I’m going to go through with it.
Griffin: He says,
Leo: Aw no, nothing to be embarrassed about, again, you look great.
Griffin: And he starts to step into the room and he takes one more step back outside, and looks at you and says,
Leo: But you should keep your elbows in. Just, just a little bit tighter.
{Amnesty theme fades in.}
Griffin: And then he walks into his apartment and shuts the door behind him.
Ned, you’ve returned to the Cryptonomica, which you have barely spent any time in the last couple of sort of frantic, monster hunting days. And as the chime above the door rings out, announcing your entrance, two figure in the room turn to face you: Kirby, and Agent Stern. They are both hunched over Kirby’s computer where you can see that they were watching the video captured on Kirby’s camera of your first run-in with Bigfoot.
Now, you have a display set up in the Cryptonomica showing some of this video, namely Bigfoot’s appearance from out of frame, where he engages with this corrupted bobcat. This sequence— this part of the video runs for about 30 seconds or so before the video loops, and it edits out a few things— it edits out your attempt at faking a Bigfoot sighting with a Chewbacca costume, it edits out you beginning to take the camera equipment apart, where you unplug the shotgun microphone out of it, which luckily then muted the video during your conversation with an off-screen Barclay, when he sort of stumbles upon you, and it also edits out the final shot of the footage, of the Bigfoot and bobcat battle being lit up by your headlights as you drive full speed into the scuffle, knocking over the camera and ending the recording before your involvement in Barclay’s rescue sort of is shown. But Agent Stern has just seen this footage, and he says,
Agent Stern: Thank you Kirby, your assistance is most appreciated by myself and my superiors at the FBI. I’d like to have a word with your employer, if you don’t mind.
Griffin: And Kirby, who looks understandably kind of nervous, excuses himself to the back room. And Agent Stern says,
Agent Stern: Ned! Is it raining? Why are you wet?
Ned: I’ve just come from a very strenuous work out, and I have a bit of a perspiration issue. What do you need, Agent Stern? I am so, so very tired.
Agent Stern: You know what I need, there, Ned. I’ve been asking for it for two days now, and yet you’ve continued to turn me away, so I decided to come here myself, and I met your assistant, Kirby, who was more than willing to show me what I needed.
Ned: Yes, and he and I will have a discussion about that after you leave.
Griffin: Agent Stern kind of picks up on your tone, and he says,
Agent Stern: Why were you trying to hide this from me, Mr. Chicane?
Ned: I will be honest with you, Agent Stern. And it’s honesty that is very difficult for me, but since I am so fatigued, and so tired, coming up with a bunch of snappy repartee is just not in the cards tonight. Here’s the thing: why should I fucking help you? You have shown shaky, at best, credentials, I haven’t seen a warrant, why in the world would I be cooperative? All you’ve been is a giant pain in the ass since I encountered you. Now, you tell me, why should I help you out, so-called Agent Stern?
Griffin: He has a briefcase that he walks over to the main desk here in the Cryptonomica, and he pops open, where he pulls out his badge with his name and picture and badge number and identification info on it that he sort of lays out. He reaches in and pulls out a case file that he opens up and inside you see pictures of other Bigfoot sightings, along with missing persons reports, sort of attached to each picture and each sighting at various points across the country. And he pulls out— well, there wouldn’t be a warrant, I don’t think, but he pulls out this documentation to sort of support his case. And he gestures towards it, and he says,
Agent Stern: My bona fides are available for you to see, if you had only asked, Mr. Chicane. I must say, I do not necessarily appreciate your tone. I am here on a job, Mr. Chicane, and I don’t mean to cause you any trouble, I just don’t understand why you are being so evasive about the facts.
Ned: [laughs loudly] Oh, you— you took my little act there as real! No, no, friend Stern, listen— let me get you, what, a latte? Would you like a latte? Sit down, we’ll go through all of this. I’ll tell you whatever you want to know. My goodness, so thin-skinned!
Agent Stern: Ned, I don’t need a latte. I just need information. I have two questions for you, and then I’m out of your hair. Kirby has given me a copy of the video on this flash drive, which I will take with me, but I need to know two things. One, have you had any further contact with the creature that you encountered on that day since the video was first shot?
Ned: Uh, no.
Griffin: He sighs, and he looks kind of disappointed, and he says,
Agent Stern: Okay. Well, it appears at one point in the video you were having a conversation with a subject off screen. Who was that?
Ned: I, uh, I’m having trouble remembering.
Griffin: He pinches the bridge of his nose with his fingers and looks up at you, and he says,
Agent Stern: Okay. All right. Ned, while you were evading me, I decided to look into you a little bit. Ned Chicane. And the funny thing is, I couldn’t find anything under that name before your inheritance of the Cryptonomica here in Kepler, West Virginia. Now, a person in my line of work, they see a capable guy using a fake name, living in a small unquestioning town like Kepler, they start to make certain assumptions as to why that is. Now, I’m not here to cause trouble for you, Mr. Chicane. I’m here to put an end to a threat that few people even within my own department, even believes exists in the first place. {Amnesty Lodge theme fades in} All I ask is that the next time I ring your bell, you come running.
Griffin: Aubrey, you are sitting in the dining room of Amnesty Lodge, and joining you at your table is Dani, who has Dr. Harris Bonkers sitting in her lap, who she’s kind of petting absentmindedly while looking out the window, and just outside that window you see Barclay step out of a small maintenance shed and look over into the hot springs, which begin refilling, much to the delight of the lodge’s Sylvan patrons, who are all standing around the empty pool expectantly sort of ready for a rejuvenating late night dip. And they all cheer at Barclay as he turns the water pump back on from inside the shed, and Barclay looks up and gives a big thumbs up in yours and Dani’s direction, and Dani smiles and says,
Dani: Well, I guess that crisis is taken care of. You all saved everyone’s lives here, so I guess we all kind of owe you one.
Aubrey: Yeah, but, okay. Here’s the thing. I haven’t even gotten to the best part yet.
Dani: Oh right, you were telling me.
Aubrey: Yes, so like, I did some shit that wasn’t just like fire, it was like wind, and I like jumped a fence, and I like made a shield - no idea how! Can’t do it now, I’ve been trying since we got back, I can’t make it happen again, but it was badass.
Griffin: She says,
Dani: So it sounds like you learned a thing or two over when you were down in Sylvain, what—
Aubrey: Nope! Didn’t learn anything. [Dani: Oh.] I have no idea how I did it. I— like, I talked with the Minister of Magic, or whatever, and they were like, you need to think about how you do what you do, and I definitely need to do that, because I have no idea how I did it. It was amazing! Oh, I wish I could do it now!
Dani: I don’t think you should push yourself. I didn’t get a chance to catch up with you after your trip, what did you think of my hometown?
Aubrey: There’s a big giant gem crystal thing, I want to touch it so bad, Dani.
Dani: Okay, but what else? I mean, it— I haven’t been there in quite some time, I guess I’m asking you how everything’s going over there.
Aubrey: It was really cool! There were, you know, people lined up to touch the crystal, and there was a goat man who was pretty nice, actually—
Dani: Oh, Vincent. Yeah, he’s great.
Aubrey: Yeah. Very nice. But he was very strict on his policies of crystal-touching. And, yeah, it was great!
Dani: Yeah, it was a— it was a great place to grow up, I mean, constant threat from humanity and the corruption beyond the city’s borders notwithstanding, it was home. I miss it a lot.
Griffin: And she looks out the window at the springs filling up outside, and she says kind of wistfully,
Dani: My family— my family is still there, Aubrey, my parents and my little brother. I’ll probably never… Sylvain is a beautiful place, but the things its people do to survive are— are unbearable. Do you have any idea what it’s like, knowing you have a home out there, and knowing that you’ll never be able to return to it?
Aubrey: Yeah, actually. I do.
Griffin: She smiles and lifts up her hand from petting Dr. Harris Bonkers and places it on yours on the table. I don’t think she was expecting you to respond in the affirmative when she asked you about your family, and she smiles and she says,
Dani: Sorry, I’m being unnecessarily maudlin. Let’s chalk it up to the old starvation. Which, I believe, you promised me a dip in the hot springs a while ago, and I think it’s time that we—
Griffin: And Dani is interrupted by the slamming of the front door into the lodge’s lobby. Standing just in front of the doorway is an imposing figure who is draped in a ratty, dirt-covered coat, and a cloak partially obscuring a scratched-up, filthy face. And this figure is clearly wounded, using what appears to be a shotgun as a crutch as they stumble into the lobby, and after taking a few steps forward, they say,
Mama: Either of y’all know how to drive?
Aubrey: Uh, yeah?
Griffin: And she throws you the keys to the truck parked outside and says,
Mama: Great. You’re gonna need to get me to a hospital.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Griffin: And she falls to her knees and collapses on the ground in a heap. And without missing a beat, Dani pushes herself back from the table, knocking over her chair as she rushes and throws open the window, and all the Sylvans outside look up as Dani announces the good news:
Dani: Mama’s home!"

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Barclay: This computer used to belong to a dude named Thacker. He was with the Pine Guard from the start too, he kept notes on everything they ever fought. About six years ago Thacker took off in the middle of the night without a word to anyone. There’s a lot of that going around these days.
Griffin: Standing just in front of the doorway is an imposing figure who is draped in a ratty, dirt-covered coat.
Mama: Either o’ y’all know how to drive?
Aubrey: Yeah?
Mama: Great. You’re gonna need to get me to a hospital.
Griffin: And she falls to her knees and collapses on the ground in a heap. And all the Sylvans outside look up as Dani announces the good news:
Dani: Mama’s home!
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays, 0:44 — 1:29]
Griffin: So it’s been two weeks since the Pine Guard defeated the abomination plaguing the waters of Kepler, West Virginia. With Duck’s blade, Aubrey’s magic, and Ned’s surprising aqua-dynamics, and a little help from contractor Pigeon, you all saved the town, except for H2-Woah, That Was Fun, which got pretty— pretty well and Phandalin-ed during the ensuing battle. But that’s ok, you can’t break a few eggs—
Clint: Without eating an omelette.
Griffin: To do— you— you’ll make an omelette if you do that.
Justin: They got a new tagline, it’s H2-Woah, That Was Fun: It’s a Big Pool Now! [Clint laughing] Because it’s just one big pool now.
Travis: I really liked how they had a big PR rebranding where they just capitalized “Was” to really hit, like, H2-Woah, That WAS Fun.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, it’s bolded.
Travis: That was— there was a time when this was fun!
Griffin: We will rebuild it. Aubrey, when you—
Travis: Better! Stronger! Funner!
Justin: [crosstalk] Wetter!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Wetter!
Clint: [crosstalk] Slurpier!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Aubrey— Aubrey, when you returned home, you witnessed the return of Mama, proprietor of Amnesty Lodge, who stumbled in looking pretty worse for wear, and then looking pretty unconscious. And she remained that way as you drove her to the St. Francis Medical Center, where she was stabilized and admitted with haste. Her condition was pretty serious— she had a few bruised ribs, a broken ankle, some internal bleeding, and a head wound that left her just down for the count.
It has been two weeks since Mama’s return. It is early November now, and snow has begun to fall in Kepler, West Virginia. Despite sort of the lovely snowy scenery, Mama’s condition has sort of cast a pall over Amnesty Lodge. And it is for this exact reason that Jake Coolice suggests a day trip to get everybody’s minds off the troublesome status of their leader. Y’all are going skiing.
[Travis gasps]
{Ski Trip fades in}
Travis: Goin’ to Pipestem?
Griffin: Pipestem?
Travis: Yeah! It’s a ski town in— in West Virginia.
Clint: It’s probably where a whole bunch of people go so they don’t go to Kepler.
Justin: Let me, uh, let me get in on this— [somewhat indignant] Fuckin’ Pipestem, dude!
Travis: Yeah, c’mon, dude!
Griffin: No, you are all actually— you three and your sort of entire Sylvan assembly are headed to the ski lodge at the base of Mount Kepler. It’s close, it’s convenient— I guess I said day trip, but it’s more like four minutes walk from Amnesty Lodge. [Travis: I see.] So you all have arrived at the ski lodge at Mount Kepler. Jake is in sort of rare form, very excited, he’s waxing his board, he’s sharing a few pointers with a few of his more concerned colleagues, Moira is attempting to strap on some skis without sort of phasing right through them with her ghost legs, Dani is like bundling up to a near sort of Randy-from-Christmas Story degree, Barclay is trying to find any kind of ski capable of housing his gargantuan feet, and— I don’t really have much prepared for this next part. I’m just curious what Duck, Aubrey and Ned are— hope to achieve from this day at Mount Kepler Ski Trails Park, is what it’s called, I guess.
Travis: Mount Kepler Ski Trails Park.
Griffin: And Reserve.
Travis: And Reserve. And Burger Place.
Griffin: Colon: That Was Also Fun.
[Travis laughing]
Travis: I’m going to say that Aubrey has never skied before in her life, so I’m going to say maybe, maybe she has swallowed her pride, and she has asked Jake Coolice for some, like, bunny slope lessons.
Griffin: For sure. Ned, Duck? What do you think your characters are up to at the ski lodge?
Clint: Two words—
Justin: Yup.
Clint: Hot toddy.
Griffin: Just bevvin’ out in the— the—
Clint: I believe Ned has had a really bad experience trying to ski, where he got to the top of the ski lift, came off, fell forward, and the swing hit him in the back of the head. [Travis: [sympathetically] Ugh!] And that kind of put him off the whole ski thing—
Griffin: Can we— can we play that out, just in foley— this is an audio medium, so maybe [Clint: Yeah.] we could do like a flashback of—
Ned: Uuhh, I’m not sure about this— heh, oh well! So what, do I just plant my feet? Okay. Wait, wait, whoa— BOOM. Shit!
Griffin: {sings Curb Your Enthusiasm theme} Bom bom bom bombombombom bom bom!
Clint: Just hang out at the lodge, drinking hot toddies, and, you know, making conversation with people, anything—
Griffin: Yeah, for sure.
Clint: Anything to keep from being killed on the slopes.
Griffin: Duck, what about yourself?
Justin: I’m going to come find Ned to come eat dinner with me. For a reason.
Griffin: Oh-kaay.
Justin: Yeah, we’re going over to Wolf Ember. It’s— the Wolf Ember Grill. It’s like the nicer restaurant, but it’s not, like— I feel like this probably isn’t one of the super upscale resorts, like I feel like local people could still go there, yeah?
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. It is the—
Justin: There are some places in West Virginia where it’s not like that, where it’s like, oh, boy, this is just people coming in from out of town.
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t— I think this is a very accessible— this is like— that’s kind of why I pinned a park to it, is that, like, this is not a fancy, fancy, super expensive snowshoe, right, where you come and you stay in the nice, nice resorts and you pay like 80 bucks for a ski lift, and then, you know, [Justin: Yeah.] ski around with your—
Travis: This is more like Pipestem in that it’s for everyone.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I guess. You keep fucking saying that, but I don’t know—
Travis: Well, it’s a resort and state park, you know, it’s got fishing, geocaching, camping, boating, biking, golfing, hiking, horseback riding—
Griffin: All right, we can all Google. Ok, let’s start with Aubrey. Aubrey, you and most of the Sylphs that came here to ride the slopes go out and you get onto a ski lift to go to the top of Mount Kepler. You’re probably there with Dani, who looks at you from behind, you know, 18 layers of thick fabric, and says,
Dani: So, how many stunts do you think— like, how many flips and grinds, like, what do you think you’re capable— I know it’s your first day, but [Aubrey: Yeah.] I guess my expectations are pretty high.
Aubrey: I mean, probably, I would say, 16 to 17, like, sick stunts? Maybe like 16-and-a-half, if I had to guess? I can do the thing where I make my skis kind of shaped like a pizza, is that a stunt?
Dani: That qualifies as a stunt, yeah, according to the X-games rules.
Aubrey: Ok, well that’s one stunt. And then I can do the thing where they’re like french fries, side by side, and inch forward. So like, that’s a stunt. And then I can do a thing where I try to stop and kind of fall over, so that’s like three stunts right there. And then I can take my skis off and go home, so that’s four stunts already.
Dani: That’s at least four good stunts, yeah, for sure!
Griffin: And as you reach the top and sort of meet up with the rest of the Sylphs who reached the top of the ski lift, Jake Coolice skis over and says— boards over, I should say, he would not touch a fucking ski. He’s a boarder for life. But he comes over to you and says,
Jake Coolice: Okay, so what are y’all feeling like? Should we just, like, head straight to Bone Mulcher, or do you want to go work our way up to Bone Mulcher, you feeling like a black diamond, blue circle? [Aubrey: [uncertainly] Uuhh…] What are you— what are you feeling like?
Aubrey: Is there like a— like “My First Hill”?
Jake: I mean there’s the bunny slope, but that’s not going to teach you the fundamentals. You gotta be in that real life-or-death, hurtling down—
Aubrey: [crosstalk, high pitched] Do you?
Jake: Yeah, I feel like you kind of— you do, a little bit—
Aubrey: [even higher pitched] Do you?
Griffin: He says,
Jake: I’ll tell you what. We’ll head to a nice little blue circle, we’ll get you started out there. It’s a bit of a longer one, so you’ll be able to get your legs out under you. What’s it— what’s it called, I’m having trouble remembering—
Aubrey: The Slippery-Dippery?
Jake: I think it is the— yeah, here it is on the map, the Slippery-Dippery. The Slippy Dip, as we call it. Or the Slip Dip, sometimes, if you are, you know, going by somebody on your snowboard really fast and you want to be able to yell out the name to them in an efficient way. But yeah, we’ll meet you— maybe the rest of the folks will meet up with us at the top of the Slip Dip and we can just do a few practice runs down that. So you know the pizza, you know the french fries?
Aubrey: Yeah? I know pizza, I know french fries, I know fall over, and I know take skis off and go home.
Jake: A lot of people won’t tell you this, the pro-skiers— pizza and french fries is basically all there is to it.
Aubrey: I— Jake, I can’t believe that’s true. This— I’m on two sticks on ice and snow, it’s really cold, and I hate that, and— it feels like I’m missing something?
Jake: I mean, yeah, I mean you are missing a lot of stuff, like one of these—
Griffin: And he just like, does a flip, standing perfectly still—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] How the fuck did you do that??
Jake: Yeah, you’ll work your way up to it. Think of it as just like super advanced pizza and french fries. All right, let’s go!
Griffin: And he pushes off towards the Slip— Slip Dip. And we hop over to Ned! You are sitting in the lobby of the Mount Kepler Ski Trails Ski Lodge and just— it’s real nice, there’s a nice little hearth going, there’s— there’s not too many people in here, just a few folks sitting around at these various sort of benches, and nice big comfy chairs by the fire—
Clint: He’s wearing one of those big puffy vests, you know, for skiers—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh, for sure—
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clint: You know, in like, red, yellow, and blue, anticipating the new Captain Marvel movie—
Griffin: With— with no plans to actually ski. It’s just a— it’s like a, what are the things they give dogs, a thunder— a thunder shirt—
Travis: Yeah, a thunder jacket.
Clint: [crosstalk] Yep! Yeah.
Griffin: [crosstalk] A thunder jacket, yeah. Just a nice warm vest on—
Clint: Well he’s wearing the vest just in case somebody comes crashing through the window off the hill and slams into him.
Griffin: A real danger at ski resorts, they don’t tell you that.
Clint: [crosstalk] That’s why he’s worried. He really worries.
Griffin: Sure. And there is an attendant here that comes to refresh your— comes to refresh your hot toddy. You’ve had a couple at this point, got that nice—
Travis: You’ve always been here, Mr. Chicane.
Griffin: And he tells you died here in the 60s.
[Justin and Travis laugh]
Clint: And there’s a picture on the wall behind me—
[Justin and Travis mock-screaming in horror]
Griffin: We have several in-fiction ghosts at this point, so I think I maybe should be careful what I make even remotely joke-canon.
Travis: Can I change my scene to happen in the hedge maze out back?
Griffin: Maybe you’ll crash into it.
Travis: Ok.
Griffin: So this attendant comes to refresh your hot toddy, and he looks at sort of your winter wear, and he says,
Attendant: So are you, uh— you planning on heading up the mountain anytime soon, before you lose the daylight and gettin’ a couple runs down?
Ned: Oh yes! That’s why they call me the Black Diamond! Ned “Black Diamond” Chicane! I— I do a lot of sluicing up there on the slopes, zipping on down— you know, ever since winning the World Cup of skiing a few years ago.
Griffin: [laughing incredulously] The World Cup of Skiing?
Ned: Oh yes, yes, you know all the countries send their best skiers, and we ski in different places and it’s— you know, once every four years, it’s pretty interesting.
Attendant: Yeah, I heard about that. I participated in the Superbowl of Snowboarding once and that went well. Won the— won the Snowboarding Stanley Cup for that one.
Ned: Ah, someone is putting his tip in danger!
Attendant: Yep, yeah. Like we say up here on the mountain all the time, I’ve got an endangered tip. But you be careful when you head up there now, all right? It seems like something has it out for Kepler’s outdoor activity centers. You hear about what happened to H2-Woah?
Ned: Oh, that was a shame. I did hear about that. And it was always a great place. But you know, they still have the pool!
Attendant: I guess they got the pool, but they got a lot of debris too. Sounds like what happened, based on what I’ve heard— I got some buddies in the force, they say it seems like something ripped that park apart. Now, innit that curious? What’s got enough power to tear apart a whole water park?
Ned: Uh, wild dogs. They— I’ve heard a lot about wild dogs. We— I mean, large, very large wild dogs. And bigfeet, the bigfeet, you know— if you cross the bigfeet— they hate water recreation.
Attendant: Yeah, I could see the bigfeet and the dogs working together for sure.
Ned: Yeah, and they’re all covered with hair, and you know, they’re like brothers and sisters.
Attendant: For sure, for sure. I got a theory, though. Don’t nobody else want to hear it, I’m wondering if you might want to hear it.
Ned: Oh, of course, yes, I live on theory.
Attendant: [takes a deep breath] Well, ‘s aliens.
Ned: Mmm!
Attendant: Yeah, they’re back here, back in Kepler. I had a little run-in with them myself. It was Tuesday night, November 15th, 1988, I was out walking my dog Braxton, got sucked up in this wormhole dealy. All of these little ephemeral beings started investigatin’ me. I told them, drop me right back down or else I was going to get my 12-gauge, fill their whole ass full of buckshot. And that must have scared them something fierce, cause they complied, drop me right back off, ain’t never seen hide nor hair of them since. Now cause I guess they’re back tearing up our water parks, guess they need a reminder, so you— you keep a lookout, come tell ol’ Eugene if you see anything otherworldly out there.
Ned: Eugene, you know what is amazing to me?
Eugene: What’s that, Ned?
Ned: That a 50-plus year old man can make a living tending bar in a ski resort. How do you do that?
Eugene: That’s for me to know and for you to find out.
Ned: Eehh, and I’m not really that interested, I just was trying to make conversation.
Eugene: All right.
Griffin: And he walks back to the bar of the ski lodge and we hop over—
Ned: Oh, loveable Eugene!
Duck: Now, Eugene— you’re giving him the story— Ned, have you not heard this one before?
Ned: Oh, about the aliens?
Duck: Yeah. I love the part—
Ned: How long have you been standing there, Duck?
Duck: Just walked up. But I— you know, I need about three seconds of that spiel before— I can recite it pretty much word for word at this point.
Eugene: It was Tuesday night, November 15th, 1988—
Duck: [simultaneously] November 15th, 1988. Yeah, we know, Eugene.
Eugene: [crosstalk] Braxton was there—
Duck: [crosstalk] Braxton, precious Braxton—
Eugene: Gone to Jesus, Braxton did.
Ned: Noo!
Duck: I don’t mean to— I don’t mean to take you away from this amazing tale—
Ned: Oh God, please, take me away. Please.
Duck: Your stellar adventure— but I have a very important errand that I need to run over at the Wolf Ember Grill [Ned: Oohh!] so if you want to join me, I’d be happy for your company.
Ned: They have amazing poutine. Amazing poutine there. Yeah, let’s go!
Duck: No, they don’t.
[Griffin and Travis laughing]
Ned: I read it on Yelp!
Justin: No, but— That’s my style. My comedy style is “No, but—”
Duck: Let’s go.
Griffin: Alright, let’s hop back to Aubrey. Aubrey, you’re on the uh, Slippery Dippery um, and uh, why don’t you roll to Act Under Pressure? Let’s see how you’re doing.
Travis: Oh my god. Not great!
Griffin: What’s your Cool?
Clint: But consistent.
Travis: Act Under Pressure? My cool is zero.
Griffin: Uh-oh!
Travis: So that’s a six!
Griffin: You’re doing fucking bad. I guess mark experience?
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: That’s good. Okay, I— Here’s what I’ll say: You’re actually doing— you’re doing alright. It is a blue circle, it is a nice— God, please let me make sure, uh, no it’s green circle, blue square. Holy shit, I’m so glad I caught that. It’s a green circle nice, nice calm sort of trail. Nice and uh, a nice long trail with some cool uh twists, twists and turns through the nice snowy sort of uh, mountainside. It’s a nice, scenic run and you’re doing okay with it and you’re keeping up pace with everybody as they sort of go down, uh with you. You’re sort of side-by-side with Dani and Barclay and Jake as they are uh, going down the hill. Uh, but you kind of break, break away because you’re not so great at controlling your speed.
Aubrey: Whoooa. Whoooaaa!
Travis: There’s a lot of that.
Griffin: You get to like the only kind of steep part of the hill and as you go over the edge of it and start to go downward, you realize that there’s some stuff on the hill? Uh, that maybe looks like it shouldn’t be there? There’s like a, like a plastic ramp that somebody has put there? There’s like a um, there’s like a sawhorse but like, really really long that has been laid out right in front of that ramp almost like a nice grinding rail, like they call them? And, uh, just like some obstacles that are set up that uh, you are just not prepared for. Your ‘pizza’ and ‘french fries’ prove sort of un— they make you incapable of navigating these. And I think you hit that ramp and just come crashing down and break through that sawhorse, for zero harm.
Travis: Oh. Whoops.
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t think it’s a serious enough thing that I would make you take damage for it. It’s a Lunar Interlude episode. We’re just having— trying to have some fun here. Um, but quickly like, the other Sylfs, they pull up beside you and come to a stop. And Dani says:
Dani: Holy shit, okay, that did qualify as a stunt, but are you okay? Is your neck hurt? Are we supposed to— Are we supposed to move her if her neck’s hurt? It’s a no, right? How’s your neck?
Aubrey: Fine? Let me— Yes. Still there.
Griffin: Jake is sort of eyeing over this— these obstacles that somebody has put out on the hill, uh, and you see behind you as you’re kind of craning your neck around, a figure come over that slope and, and come down towards you. He’s a young guy in his early twenties, he’s got a short-cropped like, mohawk. He’s wearing a black windbreaker with an insignia on the breast featuring what looks like a hornet on it, and he’s holding a camcorder. And he kicks up snow in that really cool way that— like bullies do in the movies as he skids to a stop in front of you. And he uh, he says:
Keith: Now that’s the weirdest thing— Y’all are standing on the Slip n’ Dip, which us Hornets are shooting our newest promo video on, but I don’t recognize y’all from the Hornets. Now, I might’ve missed a meeting, or something, and missed some new recruits, but I think y’all might just kind of be in the way, fuckin’ up my shot. Innit that weird?
Aubrey: Hornets?
Keith: Yeah, we’re the… You ain’t heard of The Hornets?
Aubrey: It’s just, if I were going to pick like some kind of like, mascot for like, a snow extreme sport, hornets are not like known for their sick ice tricks.
Keith: Well Hornets aren’t just exclusive to the snow. Listen, you don’t need to know everything there is to know about The Hornets. You just need to know that you don’t want to get on our bad side. So I’m gonna suggest y’all get the fuck out of here, head to a different trail. Bunny Slope might be better, just by the looks of— just sort of your ‘pizza/french fries’ technique. It’s okay, it’s getting there, but it’s not quite super stable, yet. Um, so, get? Sk… Skedaddle?
Aubrey: No?
Clint: Rumble.
Griffin: He uh, hops off his board and starts to take a couple steps toward your party, and then he looks at Jake Coolice and he says:
Keith: Ohohoho! I get it. I don’t know why I assumed y’all might be Hornets if you’re hanging with a scrub like Jake Coolice.
Aubrey: EXCUSE ME?!
Griffin: Uh, let’s hop over to Duck and Ned.
Travis: I might’ve peaked a little bit there.
Griffin: That’s alright. You gotta defend our boy.
Duck: We can just sit over here in the uh, in the corner. This booth’s normally where I, where I post up. You hungry?
Ned: Well I was— Had my heart set on some poutine, but you say there isn’t any.
Duck: No, uh, there’s not. It’s a pretty uh, straight up-and-down place. What they do have, though, and I’ll— I’ll order for the both of us. Specifically… the greatest French Onion soup you’ve ever had in your entire life.
Ned: Now don’t play with me.
Duck: I know, Ned, I know. I know it sounds like a big swinging for the prince— the fences promise, and I know that you’ve traveled all over this, uh, this beautiful country of ours, but I’m telling you: It’s the best French Onion soup I’ve ever had in my entire life. Funny enough, I, I got the recipe once. The chef, uh, Hubert, I gave him a jump when his Camri was dead back in, I guess it was probably ‘06, ‘07. And I traded in the recipe for a jump. Now I would’ve given him the jump anyway, but you know, I decided to make a run for it. Tried to um—
Griffin: Hubert— Hubert eyes you from the kitchen through a small gap in like, a window between the kitchen and the dining room just like, giving you the stink-eye because he knows you know his dark secret.
Duck: The secret is, and this is gonna fuck you up, I took it home and I uh, I tried to make it. The only one part of my plan that kind of broke down is I can’t cook for shit?
Ned: Mhm.
Duck: So I ended up with basically chicken broth and onion rings, which was not the desired effect. The only thing that even seems weird when I google other recipes, they put anise in it? Like, a little bit of anise? You’ve— You’ll taste it when we get it. But, um, it’s honestly, it’s gonna… It’s gonna knock you on your ass. And I, you will never have a better French Onion soup.
Griffin: Hubert walks over to your table— I don’t think he even needs you all to order. I think he knows what you need. I think he knows what you crave.
Duck: There he is.
Griffin: And he places the cup of soup down in front of Ned, and sure enough, this— Oh, Ned. Oh, Ned, the smell. Ned, the smell, Ned.
Ned: Mmm, the cheesiness.
Griffin: It is unfathomable. There is a nice, nice sort of browning of this cheese there—
Ned: Ouugh!
Griffin: —and it’s dripping over the side of this nice sort of terracota like, pot that this fucking soup’s in. It’s so good. And he holds the cup out, and he’s still holding yours, Duck, and he’s just kind of looking at you.
Duck: I, we’re pretty excited about it there, Hubert. Uh, thanks for uh, bringing it uh… by.
Griffin: He kind of grimaces and he leans down. He says:
Hubert: Have you kept— Have you kept its secret?
Duck: Y… eah, Hubert. I mean it’s not— Yeah. I mean, I— I mentioned one of the ingredients to my friend here but you can, you can trust him. I didn’t— I only told him about the one, the one thing. I didn’t mention the uh, the Amish gruyere you use or nothing like that.
Hubert: Oh my god.
Duck: Uh, ah, damn it. I’m sorry, Hubert. Listen, Ned’s not— Ned’s g— Ned, you’re not gonna cook this good soup, are you?
Ned: Mmm— Not uh, not right away, no...
Duck: Ned, please don’t fuck with Hubert, man. He’s dangerous. I’ve seen this guy do some shit.
[Travis laughs]
Duck: Please don’t fuck with Hubert.
Ned: Hubert, you have my word… as an honest gentleman.
Duck: Hubert, I know. This man is genetically incapable of sounding like he’s telling the truth. I don’t know why he says everything like that, Hubert, but please, you have to believe him.
Griffin: He sets the cup of soup down in front of you now, Duck, and he stands up over the table and he looks at both of you sort of unsure if he can trust you. And he just says right before he walks away:
Hubert: I know Krav Maga.
Griffin: And he walks away and leaves.
Duck: He does.
Ned: I—
Duck: What? Hell yeah! Let’s get— No, go on, I wanna, I wanna wait to eat. Cause I wanna see you, I just, I don’t— I know this is weird. I just wanna— I just wanna watch.
Clint: Well to start with, I’m going to reach down and pull up just a little bit of the cheese that has melted over the side and kind of lift that, and it kind of lifts the whole flap of cheese. Just— Just a, a taste. Just a little bit, to let the aroma come out. And it wafts out, I pop it in my mouth, and it practically melts. There’s like, no chewing—
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: —involved.
Duck: Yeah, that’s what you want. Most people just put a slab of cheese on there—
Ned: No.
Duck: But you’ve gotta grate it because it mixes into the soup! Right? That’s what Hubert told me, at least.
Ned: And look at the bread from the bread cube that’s in the middle of— What is that? It looks like, uh, a bagel, almost. The bread from a bagel. Look at the size of—
Duck: Brioche!
Ned: Brioche! Ohoho, so we have brioche and gruyere. Aw, yeah.
Duck: Yeah, it’s not an easy to pronounce soup, but it sure is easy to eat. I’ll tell ya.
Ned: Alright, it’s time for a spoonful.
Griffin: It’s actually pretty gross. Nah, I’m just kidding, it’s fucking great. Uh, in fact, as you two both duck in— tuck into this soup uh, you both get one experience point just from how tasty the soup is.
Justin: Good soup.
Clint: Alright!
Griffin: And I— Saying that, I realize you could just keep coming here and just fucking, farm. ‘What’s up, y’all, this uh—’
Justin: Fuckin’, it’s like the— A sort of [incoherent]
Griffin: It’s uh— These are the Crushbone Belts. This is an any percent run of The Adventure Zone: Amnesty.
[Travis laughs]
Griffin: You wanna skip a lot of the leveling you just go to the… Ember Wolf, or whatever it was.
Clint: Wolf Ember.
Justin: Wolf Ember. Okay, so let’s finish our soup. Here’s twenty minutes of soup-eating noises.
Griffin: No, and I’ve cut it. It’s gone.
Justin: Heh, we did record it, just so you all know.
Duck: So, right? Was I lying?
Ned: Mm-mm. Duck, I, I owe you. That was life-changing. That soup was soup for the soul. Somebody ought to write a book like that: French Onion Soup for the Soul.
Duck: It’s got— I mean, it’s catchy. You— Here’s the wild thing, okay? We got a few more minutes, right? Hold on. So, okay. It was, uh, right around my eighteenth birthday and my, uh, lady friend at the time, Tabitha, brought me up here sort of like a, welcome to adulthood kind of thing. She had a lot of friends that I didn’t really get along with. She was like— She was slummin’ it with Duck. Let’s just put it that way. Her dad, he had a lot of money. And I didn’t really get along with her friends too well. They came up here all the time, but this was my first time… coming up here. And I went out on the slopes, and none of them wanted to do the skiing class, because they’d all been coming up here for however long. So I would’ve been the only one, you know, learning how to ski. So they— I just kind of went out with everybody. And, uh… I basically kind of just fell my way down the hill? Like, some of it was on my ass, and none of it was on my feet. I just kind of like tr— trumbled. That’s not a word, but it fits.
Ned: It is now.
Duck: I trumbled my way down to the bottom of the hill and I— I had never been so cold, and I’d never been so tired— and I right then and there, I took— They were all skiing, having a hell of a time, and I just wandered over here to the Wolf Ember. And uh— I don’t know what prompted me to order French Onion soup? I think they maybe brought it by mistake. But… when I tasted it, I realized I had never eaten French Onion soup. And it was the best thing I’d ever put in my mouth. And I’d spent years, eighteen years, missing out on French Onion soup. Like all the times I could’ve eaten French Onion soup, and I’ve loved the stuff! I had no idea. And that was all I could think about.
And… that night, was the first time I turned down Minerva… Because all I could think about when she was talking about me putting my life out and risking it all… All I could think about… And I know this is stupid, but… All I could think about was all the French Onion soup I’d missed, and if I died, all the French Onion soup that I’d miss out on… in the future. I swear to god, but I turned down saving the world to eat French Onion soup. And when I say it out loud to you, now, in this exact context… I feel like kind of an asshole about it, if I’m being honest.
Ned: I get that.
Duck: … It’s good soup though, right?
Ned: It’s great soup, if you’re going to do it for anybody! Matter of fact, I— I have a special guest here to ask— come in for just a moment, please. We’re talking about French Onion soup. It’s your grandmother, boys, it’s— Nonny is here.
[Griffin laughing]
Travis: Hi Nonny!
Clint: Wait a minute, here, wait a minute— So, tell the boys, what’s the best French Onion Soup you ever had… She’s thinking.
Nonny: French Tavern in Huntington, West Virginia.
Clint: What was so special about it, do you— do you— what made it so delicious? For some reason, French Onion soup is a hot topic on this episode.
Nonny: It just had more body, it was very flavourful, it was— and it had the croutons, it was wonderful.
Travis: There you go.
Clint: There you go!
Griffin: That sounds real good— and that was in Huntington! You can’t that—
Clint: [crosstalk] That was in Huntington!
Griffin: You can’t get that in Cincinnati, not in Lexington, not if you’re living in DC—
Justin: [crosstalk] Not even in Huntington anymore. That place is closed.
Griffin: Oh, ok.
Clint: Thank you, Nonny!
Justin: Thanks Nonny!
Griffin: Bye, Nonny!
Clint: All right, I just thought I’d bring in an expert there, since we’re talking about French Onion soup.
Griffin: Yeah, and now Nonny exists in the fiction of our universe, which is going to take some time to process.
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: Aubrey, we’ll hop back to you. Things have gotten kind of heated on the hill.
Travis: Like hot French Onion soup.
Justin: I love you all dearly, very much, as my family. I would bury a bowie knife in any of your chests to eat French Onion soup this exact second.
[laughing]
Clint: I know!
Justin: Bury it to the hilt!
Clint: Oh, man— I see a merch opportunity for us.
Griffin: We’re going to sell soup?? That doesn’t— that—
Travis: Yes, we’re gonna sell loose soup—
Clint: Have you ever seen soup sold— I mean, like, French Onion soup sold in a store? No!
Travis: [repeating] Have you ever seen French Onion soup sold in a store.
Griffin: That’s a heck of a question.
Justin: [laughing] Let’s go back to the other scene.
Griffin: Okay. Things are— things have started to get kind of heated, and right as it seems like a— perhaps even a brouhaha might break out—
Clint: Ooh!
Travis: Definitely a row of some sort.
Griffin: Yes. You see a dozen figures now come skiing and snowboarding down that hill this guy just came down. And they are all descending in this perfect flying V, and as they stop in perfect formation, the person in the front of this crew pops off of their board and approaches you. And their jacket stands out from the rest of their unit. It’s bright yellow, with black accents with a striped ring around the collar. They’re wearing these slick looking black sunglasses over this neoprene half-face mask, which they pull down off their face as they dismount. And they snap, and Keith stands to attention as do the rest of the Hornets behind them. And they say,
Hornet Leader: That’s enough, Keith. We’ve got enough footage today, I think, anyways. It’s nice to see you, Jake.
Griffin: And Jake looks kind of— in stunned silence as they continue speaking and they say,
Hornet Leader: I hope my overeager lieutenant here didn’t cause you all too much trouble. The Hornets have no qualms with other extreme sports enthusiasts just looking to get a little adrenaline rush. You have my apologies.
Aubrey: And you would be…?
Hollis: My name is Hollis. I’m— I guess you could say I’m sort of in charge of this little outfit, and this is Keith, he’s my lieutenant and he gets a little excited sometimes. I try to keep it down. Sometimes it’s a good quality to have, but not when he’s just making trouble for strangers. We were just shooting a little promo video here today, and I guess you all sort of got in the shot, but I think we got enough other footage, don’t you think, Keith?
Griffin: And Keith kind of grimaces and nods.
Aubrey: Promo video for the Hornets for what?
Hollis: To put on the internet, you know, to raise our profile a little bit, try to get some sponsorships maybe. We’re always scrapping out here, always trying to make a buck. Speaking of which, we should probably get back and start editing. We got a big mountain bike shoot happening tomorrow that we need to get ready for, so— have a good rest of your day on the hill, do some sick stunts!
Aubrey: Okay. Sick jacket!
Griffin: They snap and everybody sort of hops back on their boards, and they turn to you and Hollis says,
Hollis: Hey, cool hair!
Griffin: And just like that, all of the Hornets take off on their boards and skis once more and go flying down the mountain in this formation, except for Keith, who kind of sneers at you all for like another few seconds with disdain before following behind.
Travis: Aubrey uses magic to melt the snow right in front of Keith. Just a little bit.
Griffin: Yeah, roll to use magic, then.
Travis: Ooh.
Clint: Ohh!
Griffin: Oh, that’s the good shit!
Travis: Well—
Clint: A four!
Travis: A four, plus two. Six.
Justin: Dang, how’s your magic?
Travis: Oh no. I killed Keith!
Griffin: Mark experience again— no, here’s what happens—
Travis: Welp, I just levelled up.
Griffin: Yeah, congrats. You melt the snow in front of Keith, and he eats shit. Or rather, snow, I should say. And then he stands up and looks really confused, and really really startled, and then he looks back at you, Aubrey, and is just kind of staring at you, dumbfounded, for a while. And looks back down at the melted snow, and then back up at you, and then kind of looks a little scared.
Aubrey: The ozone layer, huh? That’s weird, huh?
Griffin: And then as you start talking, he like, freaks out, and hops back on his board, and snowboards away... That’s going to be a fun hard move to play with later. [Justin chuckles] And Jake clears his throat and he says,
Jake: Hey, I’m sorry about that everybody. I— I used to roll with them back when they had— they had a different name, we called ourselves the Kepler Stunt Club back then. We were all—
Aubrey: That is a much better name!
Jake: I know! I thought so too. We were just, you know, thrill seekers of different sorts, we were sharing our passion for, you know, mountain biking and skateboarding and snowboarding and—
Clint: And breakdancing—
Jake: Motocross, just, all kinds of stuff that this wonderful sort of state allows us ample access to. And then the Sheriff I guess started cracking down a little bit on us, they were— he was saying we were a bit of a nuisance, and—
Aubrey: Parents just don’t understand, huh?
Jake: Yeah. So I guess some of them decided the best way to push back against the law and keep doing what they wanted to do was to go, you know, a little bit more illegitimate, so started calling themselves the Hornets, and they picked Hollis as their leader, and that wasn’t my scene, so I took off, and they’ve sort of harboured a bit of a beef ever since then.
Griffin: And then Barclay kind of like jumps, and then he reaches to his hip and he pulls out a pager. And he says,
Barclay: Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Uh, so good news, Mama woke up. Bad news, she did flee the hospital, so we need to get back to the lodge like right now.
Aubrey: [sings] I’m already there!
Travis: I just take off running down the— does stunt number four, take off skis, go home.
Clint: And Ned orders two bowls of soup to go so he can get two more experience points and level up.
Travis: Oh yeah, there’s nothing like old room-temperature French Onion soup. Augh, love it.
Griffin: Let’s hop forward. The three of you and Barclay are the first ones to arrive back at the lodge, which looks sort of even more idyllic with this fresh dusting of snow, there’s some icicles hanging from the roof and off the branches of the surrounding trees, and the fallen sort of frozen needles crunch beneath your feet as you step out of the car and walk towards the entrance of the lodge, but as you approach, you notice something unusual. There is a cellar door off by the corner of the front of this building that you have never really noticed before, and it is currently propped open. There’s a chain and an unlocked padlock that are hanging off of its handle.
Justin: Let me ch— see what’s going on in here, with my instincts that I have honed in the— my many years of patrolling the parks.
Griffin: Are you gonna— so that would probably be Read a Bad Situation?
Justin: Yeah, it’s just— You get mad at me when I say that, so I’m trying to put it all fancy.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Justin: And then make you say it. ...that’s a 5. Looks fine to me, boys. Take it— take it from me. Uh, that— what do you add to that—
Travis: Sharp.
Justin: Sharp? Um, yeah, so a six, actually.
Griffin: Jesus Christ.
Justin: [crosstalk] Good rolls, huh?
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s a good thing you all didn’t fuckin— on the last episode, which was the— arguably a more high-stakes episode than this mostly soup-based affair that we’ve had this time, you all were rolling fucking, those double sixes, and I guess it’s a good thing that these episodes weren’t switched, and you weren’t, you know, crushing your soup rolls and getting killed by the big water monster, but— I get to take a hard move.
Justin: Nice.
Griffin: And...I think what that is, is, as you approach, you all sort of hesitate for a bit so Duck can try to sniff out the scene, and as you are hesitating, you see Mama, and she comes out of the cellar and sees the four of you, and then slams the cellar door shut. And she turns back from the cellar door and faces all of you, very quickly, and says,
Mama: Aww, hey. Oh— yeah. How are y’all doing? It’s been a— it’s been a bit, and I’m so glad to see y’all looking well.
Griffin: And she kind of, like, hobbles a little bit closer to you all. You can tell she’s definitely not favouring that— that busted up ankle that has a cast around it. She says,
Mama: How was your— how was October? Did y’all have any fun Halloween plans or anything?
Aubrey: Mama, um, three questions. Where have you been, why did you leave the hospital, and why would you go into the cellar?
Mama: Yeah, I— maybe we can talk about all of this inside, and head to the— the inside of the Amnesty Lodge? I miss it, so bad, and, you know, I left a— I left a bagel in the toaster, and I got real worried about that, so I just want to check on the bagel situation before maybe we unpack all of that.
Travis: Uh, she’s behaving weirdly. I’m going to do… read a bad situation, if I—
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: That’s a 9, plus 1, so a 10?
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: First things first, when I Read a Bad Situation, I can use my magic eye, my third eye—
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t think that’s going to be relevant here. There’s no magic stuff happening—
Travis: So she doesn’t seem, like, enchanted, or possessed, or whatever.
Griffin: Oh, no, no, no, no. Nope! It’s just Mama, and she’s a little, you know, busted up, but she’s not, you know, a skinwalker.
Travis: So… Read a Bad Situation…
Griffin: You have questions. What’s my best way in, what’s my best way out, are there any dangers we haven’t noticed, what’s the biggest threat, what’s most vulnerable—
Travis: I would say, are there any dangers we haven’t noticed? Like, I’m going to say, Aubrey notices she’s acting kind of weird and does, like, quick look around and really takes a hard look at Mama.
Griffin: Yeah. Um, okay, yeah, there’s a low, sort of constant sort of bestial growl coming from the cellar.
Aubrey: Okay, Mama, can’t help but notice that your basement is growling.
Mama: Well, you know, I had some chili earlier—
Aubrey: Mama.
Mama: Hhh… Why did you have to hear the fuckin— Okay. Alright, I guess there’s no point in keeping this all from y’all for much longer.
Griffin: And she opens up the cellar door, and she walks inside, and beckons the four of you to come follow.
Travis: Uh, I follow. And then I’m going to say ‘What’s the biggest threat?’
Aubrey: What’s going on here, Mama? What is this?
Griffin: Um, the rest of you following as well?
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: Ned tosses back the rest of the styrofoam cup of French Onion soup and follows—
Griffin: That he’s been drinking the whole time?
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: Uh, the four of you descend down into the cellar. I will answer your question in just a moment.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: As you walk down into the cellar, the four of you are kind of, or I should just speak for the three of you, are sort of shocked at how spacious it is down here. It’s not just spacious, but it seems also kind of like, lived in? Um, this, this cellar is easily the size of the Lodge’s lobby and it appears to be sort of cut into the— into several different sections all in a considerable state of, of disrepair. Uh, there’s like a rec room-looking space with a big couch in front of like an old CRT TV, hooked up to an old Playstation One. There’s a little library like, reading corner with some bookshelves that are all just completely empty. There’s a section of it that looks like it used to be sort of a functioning gym with a weight bench with uh, no actual dumbell on it and sort of a busted up training dummy. There’s like a workshop with a dingy looking bench and like a barren wall-mounted tool rack.
And then finally there’s like, a little kitchenette in a little alcove of the cellar, and it’s cupboards— and it has like, a small refrigerator. They are all standing open and the contents of all of them are strewn across the ground. There’s cans and wrappers and empty boxes of food. It looks like this chamber was recently cordoned off from the rest of the cellar. There’s what appears to be a large net made of these thick ropes, and as you look at them, these ropes have like this, shimmering thread woven into them, almost like the Sylvan fabric that you all have seen in the past and kind of what your vest is made out of, Aubrey. Uh, and so this net is hanging over the entrance to the kitchenette, and through it you see the big danger, Aubrey. At the center of this kitchenette, there is a man. There is an older man with unkempt wild gray hair and this ratty-looking beard. Um, he’s wearing like a button-down shirt and some khakis, but they’re all just ruined. The are all just dingy and oily and torn. And as you all enter the room, he looks in your direction and he just looks absolutely feral. He sort of bares his filthy teeth at you and emits this, this low growl that you heard outside. That is what is the most dangerous thing in the room.
Clint: Ned has extensive experience with weird shit from the Cryptonomicon, so, uh, I’m assuming—
Griffin: Cryptonomi— Cryptonomica.
Clint: Cryptonomica, right, so I think he’s going to step close to the net and peer through it, and really analyze this guy, and try to figure out what sort of creature he is.
Griffin: Uh, okay, yeah, with a ten you hold two, so you get to ask two questions, and ‘What sort of creature is it?’ was your question, and the answer to that is: It’s a human. It is a human man that just looks like, uh, he has completely lost his senses, and turned into this, this sort of bestial figure that you see crouched on the ground in front of you behind this net.
Clint: Well then, second question is ‘What is being concealed here?’
Griffin: You, uh, take a quick glance around the room, and you notice there is actually one book that is sitting on a table in sort of the reading corner of the room. It’s the only book there. The rest have been cleared out, uh, leaving the room in sort of this state of disrepair. And that book is a journal, and inscribed on the front of the journal, you can see a name. And that name is…
Clint: Th... acker?
Griffin: Thacker. Good— Wow. Hey, good fuckin’—
Justin: Hey!
Travis: Whoa, dad!
Griffin: That’s fucking unbelievable!
Clint: I’m not a complete moron! I re—
Griffin: Really?!
Clint: I’ve been ar— Not complete. [laughs]
Griffin: It is the name of Thacker, who, if you remember, is the owner of the computer and the sort of former record-keeper of the Pine Guard, who I believe Barclay explained went missing a while ago. And as you notice that, Barclay also says:
Barclay: Holy shit, that’s Thacker. Mama, where the fuck did you find Thacker?
Griffin: Mama kind of sighs and then she hobbles over to a load-bearing sort of pillar, in the center of the room there are a few of these sort of strewn about. She leans up against one to take some weight off her ankle, and she says:
Mama: Alright. So, uh… God, where to fuckin’ start? Y’all are a bit new to this so, there’s a bit of context you’re probably missing out on. I’ve been doing this for thirty years, and… you used to be able to set your watch by the abominations. They— They’ve always been dangerous, but they used to be... predictable. But now they’re getting stronger. They’re startin’ to break the rules. Out of curiosity, what was that last abomination like? The one I missed out on?
Duck: It was wet, you know? It was a really watery one.
Aubrey: And it gathered around water and made itself like, bigger and it was like, you know, a watery monster thing.
Griffin: And she kind of chuckles and she says:
Mama: So, let me get this straight: We get a powerful fire-wielding magician that joins our party and the next abomination… is made out of water? Don’t you think that’s a heck of a coincidence?
Aubrey: Oh, wait. Are you— You saying somebody planned it?
Griffin: She says:
Mama: I don’t know, but for whatever reason, recently… the Abominations, they’ve started playing for keeps. So I went out and I tried to find Thacker. He— He left years ago. He head—
Griffin: And when she says his name, he kind of like, lifts his head up and snarls, and then kind of like leans back down to his sort of focused on the floor position. She says:
Mama: He left years ago. He headed out to Sylvain, to see what he could learn about, well, where the abominations come from. He went beyond the walls of the city out there. He went into the corrupted lands that surround Sylvain where those unlucky enough to get trapped end up getting you know, a little nasty. And he studied those folks. He survived out there in the inhospitable wilds all that time looking for the source of the abominations. Now, it took me a long time to find him, and when I did he well he was— He was like this. He spent a bit too much time out in the dark. He lost himself out there. But I managed to get him back here. Wasn’t easy, but I managed to get him back and lock him up down here. Down in— Wow, I haven’t been down here in a bit. This actually used to be the safe-haven for the Pine Guard where we did our work back when there were, you know, enough of us to justify having a safe-haven. Anyway, he’s not especially talkative, as you can see, but, as was his charge here with the Pine Guard, he kept records of his studies in his journals. He didn’t find anything.
Griffin: She, uh, holds up one of his journals and says:
Mama: He found, you know, some feral Sylphs, sure, but nothing like the abominations we’ve faced in the past. No, you know, cracks in the fabric of reality that these things keep slipping through. He looked for years, y’all, and he found just… he found dick.
Duck: [chuckles]
Ned: And who is Dick?
Mama: He found—
Duck: The plot thickens.
Mama: No, he found nothing. He didn’t find anything, and… What y’all gotta understand, something that I’ve been realizing over the last couple years of hunting monsters to protect this town is: We fight the abominations to protect Kepler. Because someone’s gotta do it. But one day we’re gonna face something stronger and craftier than we are. And we’re gonna lose. Or maybe we won’t. Maybe we’re gonna slay every damn thing that comes through that gate. Until we get old, until we lose our edge. Until maybe someone gets wise about the portal who, you know, crosses over and starts a war with Sylvain. Or until the gate shuts down and opens up somewhere else on Earth. Turns into somebody else’s problem. It’s starting to feel a bit like a futile effort so I— I headed out into the wilds of Sylvain to try and find somebody that I’d hoped might have an answer, but once again, we’ve come up empty.
Griffin: She uh, sets the books down and she turns toward you all and she looks, um, she doesn’t look as sprightly as she usually does. She looks pretty tired. She says,
Mama: The Pine Guard’s work is… hard. And it’s necessary. But really it’s just… a stall. U-Unless we can figure out where the Abominations are coming from… one day the monsters are gonna win.
{Ad Break 50:36 to 58:24}
Griffin: So we’re going to get to leveling up now, um— This is a Lunar Interlude, this is when we do this. This’ll also be sort of when we do the Heathcliff stuff in future episodes, but we already kind of did that this arc so, uh, gonna wait on that. But we’re gonna level up. Before we get to that, I have kind of, in fiction, given you all sort of a free bonus. Um, and it’s one, it’s like a level-up perk that belongs to The Expert that I think is really cool but none of you all are playing The Expert and I was worried that we wouldn’t get to that. And also like, I don’t think we— I think we were a little slow on the leveling in the pilot arc, so this is kind of a freebie, and that bonus is a haven. Uh, which is a mechanic in the game. It is a— exactly what it sounds like. It is a headquarters for you all to sort of use at your leisure and how it works is, you sort of design it by choosing the rooms that you want to have in it.
So in fiction, this is the cellar of the Amnesty Lodge. It’s a secure location that each of you are going to get to pick one room or one sort of section of the cellar that will be able to provide you some sort of bonus or some sort of benefit or some sort of like, in-fiction capability. For instance, you could pick the oubliette, which is a prison that you could keep a monster in or some sort of spirit or magic thing that you don’t know anything about. You could pick a workshop, you could pick an armory. You could pick— there’s a whole bunch of options and each of you are gonna get to pick one thing, which you will then kind of rebuild inside of the cellar and then have access to. So I’m gonna drop a list of these into Roll20. But yeah, there is the, uh, lore library, you can hit the books to investigate. Now that means like if, there has to be a reasonable way for there to be a book about what you’re investigating, but if you do do that, and you’re in your lore library, you get a plus one to your Investigate the Mystery roll. There is the mystical library, where you can consult occult tomes, which will grant you plus one forward, uh, next time you use magic, so just the first time you use magic after that you’ll get a plus one on the roll. You can get a protection spell on your haven, which makes it safe from monsters. Monsters cannot enter. You can get an armory, where you have a stockpile of weapons. If you need a special weapon, you can roll plus Weird. On a ten plus you have it, on a seven to nine you have it but only the minimum. I don’t really know what that means. Or on a miss you have the wrong thing. We might use that for, you know, tools and not weapons since we do have kind of another way of getting you all gear in— in—
Justin: Right.
Griffin: There’s an infirmary where you can help heal people, a workshop where you can repair things. There is the oubliette like I mentioned. There is the panic room, which has supplies where you can hide out for a few days, safe from pretty much anything, and a magical laboratory where you can uh, find tools needed for casting spells including ‘big magic’ which is a thing that we haven’t really gone over but um, yeah. So those are your options. I want each of you to pick one room to sort of uh, repair and build in the cellar of Amnesty Lodge.
Travis: I think I’m going to go with magical library ‘cause— laboratory, because it specifically like mentions big magic, which is a thing that I would like to start exploring.
Griffin: Real quick, big magic is something that is bigger than the, um, it’s bigger than like the capabilities of what the magic-using moves are in the game. So think like, for instance, resurrecting a dead party member is a thing you can do with big magic. But the terms and conditions of big magic are entirely up to me. I can make it cost whatever the fuck I want it to cost, I can make it as arduous as I want to make it. I can also just say like, ‘No, you can’t resurrect anybody. You don’t know how, that is just not possible.’ But if you want to accomplish something that is sort of outside the rules of the game, and we sort of agree on the terms of it, then big magic is what you do. So I guess if you had the magical laboratory, you’d have a place to do it and I would probably make it a little easier for you to at least get the shit that you’d need to do it.
Travis: Well let me ask you this: magical laboratory seems like it would make it easier for me to do it—
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: —but mystical library seems like it would be a better excuse for Aubrey to know how to do things that up ‘til now she has not been able to do.
Griffin: Here’s what I’ll say, because I want this to sort of be our ethos in playing this game rather than how we play D&D: don’t min-max this. What’s going to be more interesting for you. For Aubrey to have—
Travis: I think, I think it’s gonna be the library, because that’s the thing, up ‘til now, she’s been really hungry to learn anything about magic, learn how to do other magic, and her mentor person over in Sylvain told her to like try to take some time to study and pay attention, so.
Griffin: So when you use the mystical library, you’ve got like a collection of tomes from Janelle, maybe like a small collection that she allows you to take with you and when you’re working on your magic stuff, you have a place to do it now and also have sort of this kind of small, but it could be useful, mechanical benefit as well. Now, I will say I don’t want you coming back to your magi— Like if you’re out in the middle of a battle, and you’re like, ‘I need to hit it with a really good fireball. I’m just gonna go back to the mystical laboratory real quick and get the buff’ like, I would not do that.
Travis: It’s like a prep thing. I got you.
Griffin: Yeah, uh, okay! Juice, dad?
Clint: In character I think Ned would— would go for a panic room, but I can’t see that being very…
Justin: I was just thinking about that, it’s like, narratively, like where would that—
Clint: Yeah.
Justin: —be interesting for us to hide out.
Griffin: Here’s what I’ll say. If you wanna do a panic room, I’ll find a way to give you a good panic room scenar— like— and I’ll— I’ll say this: if you don’t pick panic room— [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] —whole episode: I can remember all the good times we’ve had together. Let’s just think about a few of them again.
Griffin: I will also say if you don’t pick panic room, I am also going to think of a scenario that is gonna make you say ‘God I wish we’d picked a fucking panic room.’
Travis: Well, and that’s the thing is panic rooms are not just good for you, but if we have another thing like Calvin or something where it’s like this person is in danger?
Clint: Well, yeah. Along the same lines, though, the infirmary— I mean, how many times have we had somebody have to go to the hospital so far?
Travis: Eh.
Clint: Just in, you know, in the arc.
Griffin: Yeah, I— again, do the thing that to you, you think is gonna be the most fictionally interesting.
Clint: Ah, okay, I’m gonna stick with my initial gut instinct and— and I want a panic room.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: But I want a really cool one. With like, dart boards, you know, and you know, air mattresses and not cots.
Griffin: Yeah, I like the idea of it just being like a big sort of cinder block room that is sort of carved out of the ground, like a very very sturdy room with a heavy metal door that you can lock from— lock from inside or outside if you so choose.
Clint: Cans and cans and cans of French Onion soup.
Griffin: Yeah, this is like your bug-out room where if shit gets very, very, very bad, you all have a place to hide, or you have, you know, a safe place to store somebody or a place to put somebody that you don’t want going anywhere for a little while. I really like that pick. I think that’s good. Uh, Juice.
Justin: I am going to do the infirmary, but the only thing that I have is the— we have, sort of like, a wildlife rescue center, you know, for like— especially for animals that are injured or what have you, so the only gear and equipment and meds that I was able to swipe, or, sorry, borrow, were ones designed for animals. So I have— we have an infirmary, all the tools and meds are designed for animals. So using the things there is going to be a bit— a bit more challenging.
Griffin: I like that very much! Okay, so we have a mystical library, a panic room, and an infirmary down here. I’ll give you the rec room for free, you have a nice place to chill out and play Crash Bandicoot—
Justin: Hell yeah!
Griffin: Cool! So you all have a haven, please remember that you have it whenever you need sort of an in-fiction place to do these things, whether it’s treating wounds or learning about magic or you need a place to bug out, that is sort of why this place exists. And now that we’ve done that, we need to answer the questions that we do here on The Adventure Zone. You remember, we’ve done them exactly once before: Did we conclude the current mystery?
Travis: Yes!
Justin: I think yes!
Griffin: The— talking about the French Onion Soup mystery, we concluded the fuck out of it.
Travis: Solved it!
Griffin: Did we save someone from certain death or worse?
Clint: [crosstalk] Gosh, more than once.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeeaahh…
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: Couple of times!
Travis: We did the old people in the pool, we did Calvin—
Griffin: Yes, ok, I’ll do that. Yeah, the old— I don’t know that you necessarily saved Calvin— well, I mean, yeah, sure, I think you saved Calvin—
Clint: We saved Jake! He was gon— he was gonna bite it.
Justin: Yeah, Jake was gonna beef it.
Travis: Yeeahh!
Griffin: Oh, that’s right. Okay, yes, you saved lots of people. Did we learn something about the— did we learn something new and important about the world?
Travis: Yeeaah…
Griffin: I think your visit to Sylvain alone, that episode, you learned quite a bit. [Travis: Yeah.] Did we learn something new and important about one of the hunters?
Travis: I can do different types of magic! Also, Duck fuckin’ loves French Onion Soup!
Griffin: Yeah, we learned a lot about that. Uh, ok, yeah. So if you get three or four questions as yes, you mark two experience points.
Justin: Hell yeah.
Griffin: So with that, we should have— I know all of you at least levelled up once during this arc, in this Lunar Interlude, maybe some of you twice— let’s get to it. Let’s start with— uh, let’s start with Ned. Ned, how are you doing on experience?
Clint: Ned has levelled up exactly once.
Griffin: Cool.
Clint: Yeah, because of his high success rate in rolls.
Griffin: Cool! So you have a— you see the improvements section. [Clint: Right.] You can increase sharp, tough, cool, or charm by 1, unless you’ve— what was your last one, you got an ally, right? You gained a— a crony in Kirby, which you didn’t really use this time. I would encourage you to remember that—
Clint: Well I tried, I tried to, we weren’t around him very much!
Griffin: Yeah, that’s a good point.
Clint: Can you come back to me?
Griffin: Yeah. Duck, let’s start with you. What— what’s— how many— what was your levelling up situation like? You did beef it a few times.
Justin: Mmhmm, yeah. I levelled up, and then I have one extra. [Griffin: Okay.] One extra experience. I think that I am going to… There’s a move here, uh, Devastating— when you inflict harm, you may inflict plus 1 harm. I was thinking about that, but that seems like similar to Tough, like, cause I increased my Ass-Kicking abilities last time. [Griffin: Sure.] And I think that I am gonna go with… take 1 Sharp. I feel like he’s learning, like— he’s never been in situations like this before, but he is learning about them, and he has been through some stuff at this point that has like heightened his senses a little bit. [Griffin: Mmkay.] That’s maybe part of his, like, power set, or whatever, so.
Griffin: Cool! So take plus— what’s that bring your Sharp up to?
Justin: 2.
Griffin: That’s very good. I mean, it can only go up to three, two is a very very good— good bonus.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay. Let’s— Trav, Dad, who’s ready?
Travis: I am ready. So, there is a spellslinger move called Practitioner. Choose two effects available to you under Use Magic and take plus 1 to Use Magic whenever you choose one of those effects. I’m going to say that she has had enough practice with “inflict harm” and “Do one thing that is beyond human limitations” that she is more capable at achieving those on a regular basis. [Griffin: Cool.] So anytime she does “inflict harm” with magic or “do one thing that is beyond human limitations” with magic, she gets plus 1 to that roll.
Griffin: Just to make clear, the “take harm” Use Magic roll is different from your Attack magic, which is the— every time you roll to Kick Some Ass, and you use the spell that you sort of built out of the— what is it, Blast, Fire, Force thing, that’s— that is not Use Magic, that is just your Attack. This would be like, if you, I don’t know, wanted to…
Travis: Well, so that’s the thing, is now she’s getting more access to more stuff, [Griffin: Right.] so like, fire, force, and wind are effects that she can do with her Attack, [Griffin: Right.] but if I wanted to just hurt someone, like a magical punch that wasn’t hurt by something, that would be like Inflict Harm. So Inflict Harm is just like a magical laceration kind of thing.
Griffin: Yes, cool. I just wanted to make— make it clear that you—
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, I know. Yeah, I know.
Griffin: [crosstalk] You don’t get plus 1 every time you Kick Some Ass. Okay, yeah, I like that a lot. I think that totally makes— makes sense. So go ahead and mark that down.
Dad. There’s no— there’s no other people on the podcast, so now you have to go.
Clint: Okay. Ned’s gonna go with a Crew. It’s a team of three or four people who will help you out with pretty much anything— not like Kirby, who’s, you know, an assistant he can call on a regular basis. And what I would— I think— it should have something to do with, you know, the Saturday Night Dead.
Griffin: Okay?
Clint: From the people who love the movie show, they love the TV show.
Travis: Like a fan club.
Clint: Like a fan club, yes.
Griffin: You’re an influencer to fans of Saturday Night Dead, who—
Justin: The Deadites.
Griffin: The Deadites, who we will consider—
Justin: The Dead Heads! [laughs]
Travis: I can’t believe that hasn’t been taken before!
Justin: Yeah, it’s right there!
Griffin: Okay, I like that— I like the idea of you, like, having a fan club who you can talk to by way of the show. Or, like, the fan club message boards, or whatever. Uh, so you have to pick sort of a type, their motivation, and we kind of did this when you picked Kirby to be your subordinate— your subordinate follows your exact instructions, they’re also— that might have to be what this is too, because the other ones are lieutenant, execute the spirit of your instructions; friend, to provide emotional support— probably not? That would be weird scenes to play out.
Clint: No, no.
Griffin: Bodyguard, to intercept danger— that’s also kind of strange—
Justin: [crosstalk] Yesss, so choice.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ned’s in danger, come—
Clint: How about backup? How about backup?
Griffin: That— to stand with you. Um… I mean, that means that you would say on your show, like, “hey, I’m fighting a mummy Friday night at the old tyre lot, be there or be square?” Like—
Clint: Well, but, you know, backup could come in other ways— “Hey, I need somebody who can crack this code,” or “I need somebody who can pick a lock,” or—
Justin: “Knows how to post to Twitter.”
Clint: Somebody who can do repair to— to, you know, my car. I mean, that’s also backup, isn’t it?
Griffin: Uh…
Clint: Service! The service industry!
Griffin: Okay—
Clint: Not— now, I don’t want anybody who’s going to catch a bullet for me or anything, but somebody who, you know, can be a resource.
Griffin: Can I make a suggestion that is in the spirit of this that I think is going to be a much much better fit for the thing you are actually describing? There is a move that you can take from the Flake playbook called Net Friends. You have a— you know a lot of people on the internet. When you contact a Net Friend to help you with a mystery, roll plus Charm. On a 10 plus, they’re available and helpful — they can fix something, break a code, hack a computer, get you special information; on a 7 to 9, they’re prepared to help, but it’s either going to take some time or you’re going to have to do part of it yourself; on a miss, you burn some bridges. I think that— the— and if you disagree and you want to do the Crew, that’s fine also, but like this feels more like the, like, fan club idea that you’re describing, right? And it uses Charm, which is kind of Ned’s thing.
Justin: That’s also like an area that we don’t have much expertise in that could be cool.
Travis: Yeah.
Clint: No, I’m all in favour of it, I love it!
Griffin: So that’s Net Friends on the Flake playlist. You have Net Friends now.
Clint: Can we call it something else?
Travis: Nope!
Griffin: We could call it Web Buddies.
Clint: Net Friends it is!
Griffin: Chat— Chat Room Pals!
Travis: Now, to be fair, Dad, I think you heard “Ned Friends.” It was “Net Friends.”
Justin: [laughing] Is it on the Interned? He’s gonna— that’s the name of the website!
Clint: Oohh! The Interned!
Justin/Travis: [simultaneously] The Interned!
[laughing]
[Amnesty Theme begins to play]
Justin: All the denizens of the Interned!
Clint: We’ll get on the Interned!
Griffin: All right, all right. So that’s— that’s gonna do it for this episode of The Adventure Zone: Amnesty, you’ll be able to catch the next one in two weeks. We’re going to put this one out on the Interned. Um, you’ll be able to catch it on the 26th so just dial in to your favourite Interned browser and we’ll be right there waiting for you.

Griffin: Winter has come to Kepler, West Virginia. It is late December, and the reliable crowd of out-of-state tourists has nestled into Kepler’s hotels and resorts, seeking an authentic snowbound holiday retreat. Twinkling lights cover the town’s buildings and streetlights, and a freshly-cut, garishly decorated tree stands in front of city hall. It’s nighttime, and not a creature stirs in Kepler’s festive streets. But, up the road, to the west, a van speeds down state route 66. The vehicle, emblazoned in the ancient logo of the Monongahela Forest Service, is driven by one Rick Dannon, the agency’s chief arborist. With his working day of tending to the forest’s trees behind him, he has packed up his tools and left the forest to head home. But through his windshield, the winding highway begins to vanish before his eyes as a sudden furious snowstorm materializes in front of him. Thick, white flakes whipped into a frenzy by a powerful wind blanket his vision in seconds. Panicked, he bears down on the brake pedal and wrestles with the steering wheel, attempting to maintain control of the vehicle and pull over to the side of the road.
And then, as quickly as it appeared, the storm passes. The van’s wipers kick on, revealing the road before him. Rick breathes a sigh of relief, then turns the wheel, pulling back onto the highway to continue his commute. The van pulls away down the winding highway. It passes out of view behind the mountainside. Moments later, a crash echoes through the pines.
[Pause, music swells, then fades]
Duck Newton is pulled from his slumber shortly before sunrise by the ringing of a telephone. On the other end is Ranger Juno Divine. She informs him that Rick Dannon died last night [Amnesty theme begins] in a car accident on state route 66. No foul play is suspected. [Amnesty theme continues].
Travis: But I guess any time you call Duck Newton there’s some fowl play.
Griffin: Oh, that’s pretty good.
Clint: Ha ha haaaa!
Justin: Is it— is it the— my time, Griffin?
[Travis laughing]
Griffin: Um…
[Travis and Griffin laughing]
Travis: Is Justin finally coming in to his own?
Griffin: Uh, yeah, Justin, your body’s going through some— you’re going through some wonderful changes.
Justin: [crosstalk] Is this the change? The change in life. Okay, that was not my— that was not my roll, that was my get the— get the command in there. Um, but I need to do my, uh, I need to have a vision.
Griffin: Uh, that is true. Why don’t we, uh, why don’t we roll 2 d6 plus Weird, or I guess in your case minus Weird. I love that you keep taking stat upgrades but you’ve never upgraded your Weird because you’re still so spooked out by all this shit.
Justin: Here’s the thing, the only thing it’s good for is Use Magic and I don’t have magic powers, so what’s the point?
Griffin: Sure, sure.
Justin: [crosstalk] Uh, so I—
Travis: [crosstalk] Not— not yet.
Justin: So in fiction I guess like, [laughs] I woke up, they called me and said “Danimal is dead,” and I said “Aw, shit, I’m going back to sleep. I have to— I have to have a vision about this. [Travis and Griffin laughing] Hold on, let me do a prophecy about it and I will be back with you around 8:30.”
Travis: “You guys, I had the strangest dream that I got a phone call that Danimal is dead!”
Griffin: Uh, go ahead and give me a 2 d6 roll.
Justin: [laughs] Fuck.
Griffin: [simultaneously] Oh my god [laughing] Justin! Oh my god! Starting arc 3 off with a fuckin’ bang.
Clint: It’s a 2, ladies and gentlemen.
Justin: It’s a 2 minus 1.
Griffin: [incredulously] It’s a 1!
Justin: It’s the worst possible vision that I could have. I mean, here’s what I’m gonna say, canonically, Griffin. I feel like with a roll of this calibre Duck will have something bad to him— I feel like he’s also pissed himself. [Travis laughs]. Like, I think if he has a vision that is this bad, he has to have wet the bed during it.
Griffin: Oh my god.
Justin: Canonical.
[crosstalk, indistinguishable]
Travis: Like, maybe in the vision he has a vision about using the bathroom.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And in real life he just lets go.
Griffin: Okay. No. This is gonna be a bad vision. And it also means I get to take a hard move on you in the future. Um, which last time was quite bad, so, yeah. I don’t know exactly when I’m gonna cash in that shit. But here is your… here is your vision.
I think that, I think this is the dream you were having when you were awakened by the phone call from Ranger Juno Divine, and it came to you like sort of all of your visions come to you, there’s— there’s something about it, there’s something about this thing that you can see in your dream that makes it different from, sort of, the other dreams that you— that you have. There’s something very— there’s something very vivid about it, but there’s also something kind of, um, artistic, for lack of a better term, about it. Uh, there is something almost like you’re looking at a painting or something like that, um, and the vision that you see is just stars [music begins playing].
Not necessarily like you are, you know, lying on the ground and looking up and looking at the stars, but it’s just stars and there’s— there’s no moon above, you’re just looking up into the stars almost like you’re in them. And you see this for like, a long time, I think this is a long vision. For— for several minutes you just see these stars and then one of them appears to be getting larger, and it’s kind of at the center of your view and it’s getting larger and larger still, and then you realize that it’s not a star at all. What is approaching you is… a meteor [music changes]. And it is coming at you faster and faster and as it collides with whatever your point of view is, you wake up to the sound of a telephone ringing. [Pause, music quickly fades out].
That’s about as bad as these visions get, I think.
Justin: Yeah, that’s like, not great.
Griffin: So, it is December. We are about to start our third arc, our new hunt, our new monster, and just to like, to set the scene and get some of that good character juice… I’m curious what the holidays are like for each of you. Obviously, Aubrey, this is your first sort of holiday season in Kepler and you’re living in Amnesty Lodge and you’ve been there for now four months or so, so I think you’re pretty well settled in there. But Ned and Duck, you’ve lived in Kepler for some time, and I’m just curious what the holiday season is like for each of you.
Clint: It’s kind of weird for Ned. Growing up, he was always very much “big holiday guy”, loved, you know, family get-togethers and, you know, all of the cousins and uncles and aunts and grandparents getting together and enjoying a meal. But, you know, with the way his life has developed— you know, kind of a life on the shady side— he’s kinda had to give that up. So, holidays are not a big time for Ned. He wishes they were! But, you know, he’s [sic] usually [dejected and depressed] ends up watching the Macy’s parade and eating a cup of gruel—
Griffin: [snorting laughter] Jesus Christ.
Justin: “Cup of gruel”, where does he even find gruel? [crosstalk] By himself, does he make it by himself—
Travis: [crosstalk] It’s an old, sad recipe—
Clint: Hot Pockets Gruel. I don’t know if you’ve seen those or not—
Travis: Ew.
Clint: — They’re really nasty. But he just sits there in the dark with the TV on watching Macy’s, and y’know— hating on that Al Roker guy and—
Griffin: Yeah, good. Um—
Clint: It’s just not a lot of fun—
Travis: Yeah, dig that beef deeper, dad, go for it.
Griffin: Yeah, what about the Cryptonomica? Is it— Do you do anything special for your local business in the holidays?
Clint: Well, you know, a feeble attempt to decorate. Try to have, like, some special events.
Justin: God, it’s even sadder. It’s, like, sadder to put on a few strands of lights.
Clint: Yeah, it does make it even sadder, and y’know nobody comes. Ned’s trying. So most of Ned— he’s decided he’s going to have a Christmas special on “Saturday Night Dead”, and so he’s concentrating his energies there so he doesn’t see how sad his family-less life is on the holidays. So, he’s going to have a special couple of movies on the “Saturday Night Dead”, and, um, just kinda throwing himself into his work—
Travis: Like what movies, dad?
Griffin: Well, there’s that — what’s the one that MST3K did about like the killers—
Justin: Santa Claus vs. the Martians?
Clint: Yeah, Santa Claus vs. the Martians would be a good choice.
Travis: Maybe Jack Frost, but the scary one?
Griffin: The Michael Keaton one I don’t remember being especially scary. I mean, I guess he dies and that is inherently kinda scary but he does come back and learn a very valuable lesson about family and that—
Travis: He’s a ghost that haunts a snowman, Griffin, what’s not scary about that?
Griffin: Yeah, I know it’s spooktacular. Duck, what about you?
Justin: So Duck’s sister, Jane, is not in town. He would usually spend the holidays with her but she’s doing mission work in Honduras, so she is not here currently. So he kinda hung out with friends. He didn’t feel too sad about it, it was never a real big thing for his family. A lot of friends were in from outta town. He spent a lot of time doing bar trivia and karaoke and just kinda hanging out with pals that had come back in to Kepler. People he kind of lost touch with. [stutters] So he didn’t feel too bad for himself, like I said, it’s not normally a big deal, but with Jane not there there wasn’t really a chance to do family stuff. He just kind of palled around with folks. But it was nice, it was good to see some of those folks that he hadn’t seen for so long.
Griffin: Alright. And Aubrey, what about you?
Travis: Well, Aubrey doesn’t really do Christmas [Griffin: Sure.] Aubrey celebrates Yule, or the Winter Solstice. It started when she was kind of a teenager, and it was a rebellion against her parents and, like, leaning into the magic persona. So I would not say that Aubrey identifies as Wiccan, but with time as she grew older she actually did the research into it and found that it seemed to be a purer form of the things that we associate now with Christmas, and so it became more traditional in her mind and a lot more about the spirit of it without all the stuff piled on to it [Griffin: Okay.] That kind of thing and a lot less about, y’know, family. And I think a lot of that now is because she does tend to be on her own a lot more [Griffin: Man, yeah.] so she doesn’t really have a lot of traditions that kinda date back to family times.
Clint: Wow, we are a damaged bunch, aren’t we?
Griffin: Yeah, no kidding.
Travis: Yeah, dude.
Griffin: That’s good stuff though. I think that’s kind of the aesthetic of Amnesty Lodge, just a lot of festive, warm, welcoming sort-of winter time decorations. And in fact, let’s jump to that. So it’s a few days before Christmas, I want to say it’s the 21st or so, and in the afternoon Mama has called you all in to Amnesty Lodge to discuss your next hunt. Duck and Ned, as you arrive, and Aubrey, as you go to greet them, you all enter a very festive scene in the lobby. It’s decorated with garlands and wreaths, and the hearth is roaring in the centre of the room, providing much-needed warmth to combat the very cold weather outside. Jake and Dani are hanging up some more decorations here in the lobby area, and Moira is tinkling away at the piano trying to figure out some holiday standards sorta by ear. They probably don’t have tho— I mean, they definitely don’t have those in Sylvain, so she’s trying to sort of master them on her own. And Mama emerges from her office, and she’s walking with a cane made of this dark gnarled wood, it wouldn’t surprise you if she made this cane herself from some stuff she gathered in the woods around the lodge. She gives you all a faint smile as she sees you all, and she says:
Mama: Well, looks we uh— looks like we got the band back together, how y’all been?
Duck: Good, you know, my sister Jane was doing missionary work in Honduras, and normally I would spend the holidays with her [Griffin laughing] but I had some friends come in from out of town—
Mama: Oh, that sounds nice.
Duck: — And I wanted to communicate this to anybody who might be listening, somehow, and I thought this might be a more organic way of doing it.
Mama: Yeah, sure. That’s a strange way of just sort of conversing with another human being.
[Justin laughing]
Ned: I’m doing well, they have a two-for-one BOGO sale down at the A&P on Gruel Hot Pockets. So—
[Justin laughs]
Mama: Alright.
Ned: — Happy holidays, everybody!
Travis: Aubrey looks up from her book, and says,
Aubrey: I celebrate in like a “not really traditional so much as it’s my tradition!” [sic]
Travis: And back to the book.
Mama: Alright. I feel like I knew all that about all y’all already, somehow. I don’t know if maybe it’s because we knew each other for a while, and I’m just on some sort of psychic link level with y’all, but thanks for coming. We, uh— well, we gotta talk, and I’m thinking we might wanna have a change of venue, thanks to the proximity of our special guest.
Griffin: And she sort of gestures towards the dining area where you all see Agent Stern—
Travis: We haven’t killed him yet?
Griffin: [laughing] No?
Travis: Man, we are slipping!
Griffin: He’s drinking— yeah, it’s a different age from the Balance age where you all— maybe it’s just because you can’t find a good cliff side to huck a body off of discreetly. But he’s drinking some cider, and he’s going over a Lamplighter with like a red sharpie, circling what you assume to be leads for his own monster hunt.
Travis: Oh, not just like corrections?
Griffin: Uh, he’s probably doing a little bit of that, also. It’s sort of a one man operation with Kirby leading up the publication, so, you know, there’s probably not much copy editing going on there. But she leads you all down into the cellar, which looks completely transformed from the first time that you saw it, thanks to sort of your own modifications and Barclay’s general cleanliness. And you catch him down here as you enter, he’s sliding a tray of food under the net that is sort of covering the kitchen area, where you see Thacker, who still looks unkempt and, like, vaguely inhuman. But he appears to be a lot more docile than he was just a— last time month. He doesn’t seem to respond as the tray slides to his feet, he just kinda sits perfectly still in the center of the kitchen, just kinda clutching his knees and looking down. And after you all settle here in the secret HQ of the Pine Guard, Mama says,
Mama: Alright, so, couple updates. First of all, Thacker hasn’t really gotten any more lucid since I brought him back, so no real developments in the, “find what’s bringing monsters to Kepler and stop it” department. I don’t really know if he knows anything that he didn’t write down in his journals, but, until he snaps out of it, we’re just gonna have to remain in the dark on that subject. Have y’all managed to get any leads on seeing where all this stuff’s coming from?
Duck: I should’ve put some time into it, honestly, but I uh… I was real busy with family over the holidays, so I didn’t make much—
Mama: You literally just said you didn’t have any family in town [crosstalk] over the holidays.
Duck: [crosstalk] God dammit. [crosstalk] Dammit!
Mama: [crosstalk] I mean, it’s fine if you couldn’t dig anything up, but you don’t gotta lie to old Mama, you know?
Duck: Dammit! [group laughter] Dammit, Duck!
[Travis laughing]
Mama: You don’t have to beat yourself up about it, Duck, I mean po—
Duck: [distant] Fuck!
Mama: — No, pobody’s nerfect, you gotta calm down, alright?
Duck: God dammit.
[Travis laughing]
Mama: Alright, Duck’s having an episode.
Duck: I tried to lie, and it just don’t— I just don’t flow! I don’t know how y’all do it!
Ned: Oh, it’s easy! [crosstalk] Piece of cake—
Duck: [crosstalk] I mean Ned, [laughing] I was trying to be kind.
Mama: Alright, well it’ll probably be a lot easier to investigate that stuff when we have a monster on our hands. And that kinda brings us to our next subject: it’s three days to the full moon, so we’re in the window now, and I keep my ear to the ground when we’re in the window, you know, looking out for police chatter, freaky shit coming into Saint Francis, social media— I’m all plugged into all my sites—
Aubrey: What’s your follow count? Are you verified?
Mama: I am not, and I got about 31. Is that good or bad?
Aubrey: How many do you follow? That’s really, you have to do kinda— it’s a ratio?
Mama: Yeah, I follow about 300 or so.
Aubrey: Eughhh.
Mama: Aw, yeah, I know, I ain’t gone viral yet. But I ain’t seen nothing on— [crosstalk]
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Well, I— you were really popular on Vine before that shut down, I’m sorry about that Mama. [crosstalk] We’re all still reeling.
Mama: [crosstalk] Yeah, it’s shame. Yeah, they did a lot for the Vine. I haven’t seen or heard nothing especially abominable yet, so, y’all got any ideas on— y’all heard anything that might be kind of out of the ordinary?
Duck: Is it safe to assume that like— well, you know what? It’s probably nothing, I don’t know, it didn’t seem particularly spooky to me when I heard about it, but um… a friend of mine— sort of friend, Rick Dannon, he died last night, and there wasn’t any foul play or anything suspected, which is not that big of a surprise, I know in this region. The thing that kinda tripped me out about it was that Rick— Rick and I used to work together, Rick Dannon, we called him the Danimal. We used to work together, and he’s the one, when I was first coming up, he’s the one who taught me, like, how to handle the vehicles, how to safe in the snow, and always put your chains on and everything— it just… I don’t know. If somebody was gonna have that kind of accident, wasn’t brought on by some drunk driving idiot or something like that, it seems… I don’t know. It’s probably nothing, I’m just kinda talking out my ass, but it’s the only sort of thing that has stood out to me recently as like, I don’t know, a little weird.
Griffin: Mama shrugs, and she says,
Mama: [sighs] I mean, right now I think it’s probably the best lead we got so far, if we got a death that you think is even a little bit suspicious. I think we should probably check it out—
Duck: You know, Mama, honestly, even if isn’t… ghosts and ghouls or whatever, I would like to know what happened. Rick and I had a rough patch there at the end, and uh, I don’t know, I’d just like to know how it all shook out.
Mama: I am sorry about your friend, Duck. And I think that’s a good idea. I think that’s probably our best lead we got right now. So, how ‘bout this: I’ll keep poundin’ the pavement, and keep my ear to the ground, and keep my eye on… uh, you know—
Duck: That’s three metaphors, you got anymore, or?
Mama: I’ll keep, sort of, my head to the grin— my nose to the grindstone—
Ned: Ow!
Aubrey: Maybe head on a swivel?
Mama: I’ll keep my head on a swivel and, you know, keep my ear open for anything else I can hear that might sound kinda freaky, but why don’t the three of y’all go check out the—
Aubrey: Mama?
Mama: Yeah?
Aubrey: Can I go to Sylvain?
Mama: Yeah, I mean, if you want to—
Aubrey: I just, I— in that last thing, I accessed some new stuff, and I’ve been reading these books trying to make sense of it, and I feel like I’m just reading the same sentence over and over again, and there’s the Minister of Magic over there and I have so many questions.
Mama: Yeah, I mean, I think it’ll be a good idea. I mean, you won’t be able to go through the gate until tonight, but I think if you wanna head over to Sylvain, you should. You’re free to come and go as you want now.
Aubrey: I don’t need, like, a permission slip or anything?
Mama: [laughing] No, you just need to get the moonlight on the gate and head on over.
Aubrey: Okay.
Mama: But for now, why don’t the three of y’all and Barclay go check out the scene of the crash and see what you can find out, see what looks particularly monstrous.
Travis: Is it snowing, Griffin, in Kepler?
Griffin: Uh, I don’t think it’s snowing right now but it’s going to be pretty cold outside for a while, and so, all of the snow that has fallen is still kinda on the ground.
Travis: Oh, so there’s snow, that’s what I mean.
Griffin: There is snow, yeah. I think public works does its best to keep it off of the roads and the highways, but I think this is probably an area where snow tires are kind of a necessity. [crosstalk] But yeah, there is snow.
Ned: [crosstalk] Ah ha! I got new chains on the Lincoln, my friends.
Aubrey: Okay, Jacob Marley. Uh, Mama, I have a quick question— or a suggestion, maybe, idea? Barclay’s great, but maybe we should take someone who also knows about like snow, and, you know, kinda winter terrain and… maybe see if Jake’s free?
Mama: I mean, we don’t usually take Jake along on Pine Guard business, but if you think we need a snow expert, I guess so. I wouldn’t send him into the mouth of a dangerous situation. I wouldn’t send him into the lion’s maw, but if y’all are just goin’ to check out, you know, the scene of a crash, I guess you could take ol’ Jake. You okay with that, Barclay?
Griffin: And Barclay, like, nods.
Aubrey: He’s just been a little bit down. We had a run-in with some neighborhood toughs and they kinda gave him a hard time, and I think it really got to him.
Mama: Uh, yeah!
Aubrey: I just want him to feel a little bit more part of our group, you know?
Mama: Yeah, for sure, I think that’s a sweet gesture. Why don’t y’all take Jake Cool-Ice down to the scene of the crash— I think it’ll cheer him up, seeing, you know, a place where a man recently died. [Justin and Travis laugh] I like your instincts there, Aubrey, I think that’ll be real good for him.
Aubrey: Cool.
Mama: It’d just sorta confront, sorta, the terminus of the mortal coil that we’re all standin’ on, he’ll realize— [crosstalk]
Ned: [crosstalk] I mean, look at the way he leads his life, I mean, he’s reckless and he doesn’t care. He needs to have an appreciation of death.
Justin: [laughing] Shake him up. [Travis laughs] “I’m Jake Cool-Ice and I’m now an insurance salesman.” [Clint laughs]
Travis: “You know, death could come at any time.”
Justin: “I had to confront that, thanks to a dear friend that was trying to cheer me up once.” [Griffin and Travis laugh]
Griffin: Alright, so the three of you head back upstairs in Amnesty Lodge. I want this scene, I think Jake Cool-Ice is like, walkin’ to the door. He’s just finished helping Dani decorate, and he’s got his board and, sort of, his gear on and his goggles, his board’s freshly waxed, and he sort of waves and he’s like,
Jake: Oh, hey guys, what’s goin’ on? Y’all look like you’re in a hurry.
Aubrey: Well, Jake, um, we have got a very important mission we’re gonna go investigate, and I don’t think we can do it without a snow expert.
Jake: I mean, I know a lot about snow, but—
Griffin: And he leans in close, because Agent Stern’s still kinda in the adjoining room, and he says,
Jake: Is this, uh, is this Pine Guard business?
Aubrey: Yes it is, Jake. Yes it is.
Duck: You’re getting the call, man.
Griffin: He looks fucking psyched, he’s like,
Jake: Oh man, I fucking— yes! I knew it, I’ve told Mama for such a long time, like, I’ve got what it takes to save the day. What’re we doing, is there like a mummy or something we need to—
Aubrey: Slow down, rook. You’re just getting started, and this is the beginning, but we’ll see, you know. You just keep your head on a swivel, your nose to the grindstone, you keep your ear to the ground.
Duck: Keep reaching for the stars.
Aubrey: You reach for the stars [Clint laughing] and we’ll see how it all plays out.
Griffin: He says,
Jake: Alright, let’s go!
Griffin: And he sets his board down, and the four of you now head outside towards Ned’s Lincoln. Uh, and as you step outside, it is— it’s the weirdest thing, because you just sort of walked in the front door as you came back up from the cellar, and this wasn’t there before, but now it is there. There is, sitting in front of the door, a small card. And as you sort of approach it, you sort of survey the card— it is written on sort of a fancy white stationary, with a lacy red trim pattern around its border. And at the bottom right corner of the card is a stamp in red ink, and that stamp has a design of a paw print inside of a thick red circle. And written on the card are three bullet point items that—
Travis: Oh!
Griffin: Yes, if you remember, that’s sort of how we’re doing the economy in this game.
Travis: It was just such a threatening and scary way for it to pop up. [Travis and Clint laughing]
Griffin: Oh, was it?
Travis: Yes! I thought you were about to introduce a serial killer character to the show.
Clint: The Red Paw!
Griffin: Uh, written on the card are Heathcliff’s bounties, which are: “A lawkeeper’s symbol, [crosstalk] a seer’s spectacles—”
Justin: [crosstalk] Badge. First one’s a badge.
Griffin: “A seer’s [crosstalk] spectacle—”
Travis and Justin: Glasses!
Griffin: “And a victorious seed.”
Travis: Some semen.
Justin: [laughing] From a really good sports guy.
[group laughter]
Griffin: Get huntin’, gumshoes.
Justin: “Go get Michael Jordan’s semen!”
Griffin: Michael’s secret stuff!
Justin: Get Michael’s secret stuff!
Travis: “Hey guys, it’s me, Michael Jordan, I just moved to town!”
[music fades in]
Justin: Dad met Joe Namath at San Diego Comic Con, so we got an in there. If we want his champion seed. [Travis laughing]
[music]
Ad Break {27:35 - 33:17}
[Amnesty Theme plays]
Griffin: So it is around sunset, and the four of you arrive at the scene of the crash on State Route 66, which is just sort of around this sharp hairpin turn around a hillside. And about halfway through the turn, the guardrail has just been demolished, and next to it you see a forest service van that has been hauled out of the woods sort of beyond the guardrail. The front of the car is just crumpled, there’s bits of woodland debris that are sort of stuck to its grill, and sort of in its shattered windshield. There’s no body, that has long since sort of been carted away. Instead there’s just sort of the remainder of this crash. And parked just in front of the van is a Kepler Sheriff’s Department vehicle with its lights flashing. And as you all sort of arrive without any troubles, because of Ned’s expert driving, and good snow tires— I couldn’t think of a great adjective there—
Clint: Chains. Great chains.
Griffin: You all exit the Lincoln and—
Clint: Before we do, [Griffin: Yeah.] I want to prepare Jake just—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay. Yeah, let’s have that.
Ned: Jake, have you— have you had driver’s ed classes at your school?
Jake: I didn’t really go to school, and we don’t really have ca—
Travis: [crosstalk] “I’m 43!”
Jake: Yeah, like— we don’t have cars in Sylvain, so— you recognise what a wild—
Ned: They show these— they show these films—
Jake: Yeah.
Ned: In driver’s ed class that I thought— [Jake: Okay.] That might prepare you for what you’re about to experience, but nevermind. Neeeevermind. It’ll be fine.
Jake: Mmkay. Is there gonna be a monster when we get there, though, or what’s up?
Aubrey: You never know!
Ned: That’s why you gotta keep your head on a swivel, kid!
Griffin: He looks— now you’ve made him worried and he continues to look worried as you arrive and get out of the vehicle. And as you do, the driver of this Sheriff’s department car steps out. Duck, you— and Ned, maybe, depending on— you’ve probably had run-ins, I think we’ve established you’ve had— not necessarily criminal run-ins, but sort of distrust from the Sheriff’s department. You all recognise him as Deputy Dewey, Zeke’s second-in-command. He’s just this, like, tall, awkward, kind of young guy, and he’s not especially well dressed for the cold, I think he’s just like wearing a short-sleeved shirt and he does not look especially comfortable out here. And he approaches you as you all step out of the car, and he says,
Deputy Dewey: [nasally drawl] Folks, I’m gonna need y’all to keep moving down— [Travis bursts out laughing] Oh. Aw, shit. Duck, what’s happening, man?
Duck: Hi, Dewey.
Travis: [imitating Dewey’s voice] “Aw shit, why do I sound like this?”
Duck: Hey, Dewey, what’s going on, man?
Dewey: Aw, you know, just sort of camping out in front of the scene of the— aw, damn! Aw, that’s right, you knew Rick, didn’t you? Aw, sorry— aw man, that’s a bad beat, I’m sorry dude.
Duck: Yeah, it’s all right, Dewey. Are you still doing the— that thing where you pretend, with all your friends, to do like dungeon hunts and stuff like that? You throw tennis balls at each other?
Dewey: Aw, LARPing?
Duck: Yeah, yeah, LARPing! That’s it, shit.
Dewey: Yeah, we do a little, you know, creative anachronism here from time to time. We head down into the park and we do— I do a woodland elf, his name’s Zeph— Zephius. And he— he’s a warlock, so I do a little bit of that on the side. You want to come do that with us sometime?
Duck: Yeah, first, though, I love the sound of this woodland elf character. Can you tell me 70 hours of stories about him and his friends and all their kind of adventures?
Dewey: Um, I mean, maybe, if you wanna, like—
Duck: I’ve got time, it’s fine.
Dewey: Well all right. Well—
Griffin: [laughing] Are you trying to fucking make it so that Balance is a creation of Deputy Dewey’s mindscape?
[Clint and Travis laughing]
Justin: No, I just want to try to please everybody. You know, some people prefer that, so I figure here, you could have a—
Griffin: There is a shocking amount of our listener base that wants there to be ties between all of the different universes we make—
Justin: Yeah, there are.
Griffin: I think— I think if this is the tie between— if Amnesty is just— if Balance is just the fever dream of Amnesty’s new side character Deputy Dewey, that would maybe not be the most satisfying result.
Justin: There are connective ties that— it is one coherent planar-verse—
Griffin: Okay, no. Um—
Justin: It is!
Griffin: Dew— all right.
Clint: The planar-verse! I like planar-verse, though.
Griffin: Dewey— Dewey says,
Dewey: Yeah, I mean, we can talk about that some other time, when I’m off the clock, but I kind of do need y’all to— I mean, this is, like, I don’t know if it’s a crime scene or what, but we gotta investigate, and look into it and wait for the tow truck to come and take the car away, take it to impound so we can take a look at it there. But, yeah, so— it’s nice to see all of y’all. I’m going to head back to my car, because I’m freezing my— my nards off, so. Yeah, do y’all need anything, though? Is there any trouble?
Aubrey: ...Coffee?
Dewey: Are you saying you… want coffee? Cause I’m not a— I’m not equipped to give you coffee.
Aubrey: Okay. I mean, you asked!
Justin: Do— I’m going to— I’m trying to think if there’s anything useful—
Duck: Hey, Dewey—
Justin: Let me just— I’ll just straight up ask you for a ser— 'fore I start spinnin' {{38:56}} dice.
Duck: Dewey, did anything seem, I don’t know, off about this? You've seen some crash sites and stuff like that in your days. Does anything seem weird?
Griffin: I’m trying to decide if— I think that you—
Justin: I could pr—
Griffin: I think that sort of by your conversation, I think Dewey kind of knows you, and he knows that like this is your buddy who died, and so—
Justin: I— let me say this, though, I do think that you could make a rational argument— and I don’t know why I’m trying to make it harder on myself— you could make an argument that— I think you could make the choice that, if maybe you don’t have a lot of authority, you’re a cop in a small town, maybe you don’t have a lot of power, you might tend to get kind of territorial about other [Griffin: Sure.] branches of, you know, officials, or however you want to put it.
Griffin: I think if this was Sheriff Zeke, I think that would be true. I think Deputy Dewey, I don’t think you need to convince him just to talk to him. I think if you want to actually investigate the car and investigate where the car crashed and see what visual clues you can find, you’ll definitely have to. But I think this is just a roll and Investigate a Mystery, talking to Dewey to ask him questions about what he knows, I think he’ll just tell you.
Justin: Okay. I will say, though, a lot of my Investigate a Mystery questions are specific to the creature, which he’s not going to [Griffin: Yep.] have any sort of insight into, yeah?
Clint: Well there is a “What happened here?”, maybe he can interpret the accident?
Justin: Ehh…
Griffin: Yeah, I mean, he will— I’ll tell you this, Dewey may not know much, but he may know one or two things, and if you ask the right questions, you’ll get that information—
Justin: [crosstalk] Ok, yeah, let’s do it.
Griffin: —if you ask the wrong questions, he won’t.
Justin: I’m gonna grill him. Six… plus two. Eight.
Griffin: Okay. That’s a mixed success. On a seven to nine, you hold one, so you get to ask one question. What happened here, what sort of creature is it, what can it do, what can hurt it, where did it go, what was it going to do, what is being concealed here?
Justin: Mmmm…
Griffin: This doesn’t have to be the only Investigate a Mystery thing that you guys do here. In fact, I sort of envision you doing a few, so— yeah, don’t—
Justin: Let me ask the broadest possible, and—
Duck: It seems obvious, but you’ve seen a lot of crash sites and stuff like that. What do you think really happened here?
Dewey: I’ll tell you, just ‘cause, you know, it’s your friend. It might be hard to hear, you sure you want to know about this, Duck?
Duck: Yeah.
Dewey: All right. I mean, we can— I took a look at sort of the tracks in the ground, and obviously we need to get a detective out here or something, at least the Sheriff to come out and give me his opinion, but my opinion, what happened— he drove through the guard rail and went down the hill a bit and went into the trees, and hit the trees at considerable speed. And that— he probably died on impact, so I guess that’s at least the, you know, the one benefit to this, is it didn’t hurt much, I guess.
Duck: Well— ok, but wait. What was the weather like when this happened?
Dewey: It was— it was, you know, there was snow on the ground. The road was relatively clear, there was a little bit of dusting on the ground, but seemed to be no issues with— I mean, it wasn’t snowing in Kepler when it happened, so I don’t think weather had anything to do with it.
Duck: It just doesn’t make sense.
Dewey: It’s the weirdest thing, though, Duck, is, there weren’t any skid marks on the ground. There weren’t any skid marks on the ground, there wasn’t a second set of, you know, of tire tracks, so it’s not like they had to dodge out of the way of something. Wasn’t like they slammed on the brakes to get out of the way of like a deer that was in the road, they just kind of like— they just went. They just went through the guard rail, and that was it. They went through the guard rail real fast, and that was it. So— it’s hard for me to discern a cause, and… yeah, I don’t know.
Duck: The brake fluid intact, and everything?
Dewey: I mean, the car got pretty fucked up—
Duck: Sure, yeah.
Dewey: But, uh, I’ve— it’s hard to tell about the brake fluid.
Travis: Griffin, could I try— so I want to do Read a Bad Situation, not because I want to read a bad situation, but because I want to use my Third Eye. Does that make sense? Cause it’s like tied together—
Griffin: Sure, yeah. I think you could still ask like a question here, off the list, and—
Travis: Ugh. Not great.
Griffin: What did you get?
Travis: Uh, it’s only a five, so I can’t read shit.
Griffin: On a five I make a hard move against you. I would say unless somebody wants to help out, I would only give you a plus one, and would open them up to sort of— another bad thing that could happen. So you don’t really notice anything— you don’t really notice anything bad, Aubrey. You don’t seem to notice anything magical, you get the sense that you didn’t— you weren’t necessarily attuned, but you— you don’t notice anything.
Travis: Hmm. Then instead, I’ll turn to my friend and rookie partner, Jake Coolice.
Jake: So, what’s the plan? You need me to take the Deputy out so you all can get a look at the crash site, or—?
Aubrey: What? No. Not yet. Here’s my question for you, Jake. You know this area, you know the weather, right? You know snow, and the woods, and stuff. Do you notice anything— trees, broken limbs, uh, you know, anything like that?
Jake: There’s something weird.
Aubrey: Okay?
Griffin: And he points to the snow, and he says,
Jake: I know snow. I know what a nice sort of coating of fresh powder looks like, right? It cakes down, and it forms kind of a solid surface.
Griffin: And he points kind of down the— down the hillside, not really where the car crashed but just off to the hillside, and you do see just sort of this carpet of snow, just everywhere. But it’s not like— it’s not flat, it’s not perfectly flat. It almost looks like pockmarked. It almost looks like there’s just kind of— there’s little, very very small divots that you definitely would not have noticed if Jake had not pointed them out to you. But there’s something sort of peculiar, it’s not just this perfect, flat sheet of snow. There’s pockmarks.
Travis: So not, like— not like, footsteps small?
Griffin: No, no, no, like way way way smaller than that.
Travis: Is it in any kind of trail?
Griffin: Nope. Just kind of all over. I think that’s it. Ned, you want to do anything?
Clint: I have questions about the body. I have questions about what killed the Danimal, but I don’t if this is the place or if Dewey would have any insight on—
Justin: That seems to be a stretch for Dewey to reveal the…
Clint: Yeah…
Griffin: Well, Dewey did say he died from impact of the car crash, he did say that to Duck.
Travis: What the fuck does Dewey know?
Griffin: Yeah, I mean he probably saw the body.
Justin: Ned’s a car guy, right? Have we established that?
Clint: Yeah, he is actually.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure!
Duck: Ned, take a look at this van and I know it’s a little bit fucked up but… Do you see any reason that the brakes in this van would not have worked?
Griffin: As you all approach the van, Dewey steps in front of you and he says,
Dewey: Now, hold on guys. We do need to still sort of do—
Aubrey: Dewey, was it?
Dewey: Yeah.
Aubrey: Dewey, do you like magic?
Dewey: [laughing] Hell yeah, I like magic! David Blaine, fuckin, uh—
Aubrey: Yeah!
Dewey: Yeah, he does this thing where he spits up— he barfs up the frog, I’ve seen that— makes me wanna barf!
Aubrey: Yeah, right? And like— would you like to see— I’m… I don’t wanna brag, but—
Justin: Alright, they’re having this conversation, I’m—
Griffin: No, I’m gonna need Aubrey to roll to… probably Manipulate Someone. Uh, and that is the reason that you’re doing— once you’ve given them a reason, the reason is, “Do you wanna see some cool magic?”, and what you want is to distract them, so [crosstalk] that Ned can investigate the car.
Travis: [crosstalk] I rolled an 11 plus 1.
Griffin: Holy shit!
Justin: Hachi machi, that’s some good fuckin’ magic.
Griffin: So, they will do it for the reason that you gave them.
Dewey: Ah, shit yeah!
Griffin: Where are you, like, leading them to?
Travis: I’m basically just like, you know, whatever keeps his back to the car, that’s what we’re doing. I also will say, how distracted is he? Oh, I know what trick I’m gonna do! I’m gonna make his badge disappear! [Justin laughs] Because it’s a law keeper’s symbol.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Ah, shit, I love that. Oh, that’s so good.
Griffin: Alright, let’s play that out.
Aubrey: Okay, now Dewey, I’m gonna need something from you. Something important. What on you right now is something that you would not only hate to lose, but maybe would get in trouble.
Dewey: Oh, my gun?
Aubrey: …Well, maybe not, Dewey. Maybe not a gun.
Dewey: Oh yeah, yeah, no, you’re right, I’m sorry, that was dumb. I can’t give you my gun!
Aubrey: Yeah.
Dewey: I don’t know what kinda David Blaine trick you’re gonna do with my gun, but I got my— I got my wallet, I got my keys, I got my badge, I got my phone.
Aubrey: Let me see the badge, that should be just about the right size.
Griffin: He hands it over, he says,
Dewey: Alright, but be careful— I don’t think I can get a replacement one, and Zeke’ll be pissed as hell if I lose that.
Aubrey: Oh, I totally understand, I’ve never blown this trick before.
Travis: So while this is happening, Ned’s investigating the car, right?
Griffin: Alright, we can jump over to that. Ned and Duck are by the van.
Clint: Alright, so Ned takes off his big, puffy, red-yellow-and-blue vest. [Griffin: Okay.] And does uh, an investigate check under the van.
Griffin: Uhh yeah, go ahead and investigate a mystery, I’m gonna give you plus one forward, because like you have this driver tag that hasn't especially come in handy, ever, but you do have like car auto experience.
Clint: Alright yeah, so I rolled a six, plus the one, would be seven, plus two for sharp, which I get to use here too.
Griffin: Brings you up to nine and uh, Duck, if you want to help him out somehow, we can get that up to a 10. Um, if you wanna roll Help Out and explain how you are helping out— or Aubrey, if you wanna roll Help Out as sort of your distraction. But you all— I don’t think we’ve ever done Help Out, but you can get this from a Mixed Success to a Complete Success if you can tell me how you are helping Ned.
Justin: Um… yeah, lemme try— Do you want me to see if it works first before I waste time telling him? [Clint laughs]
Griffin: No, I mean— here’s the thing, if you decide to help out, and it doesn’t work, then there is still a thing that happens, it’s just probably not gonna be great.
Justin: Um,
Duck: Ned, you should know that Rick was a real safe driver and he would’ve taken really good care of his car. I— [sighs] I’ll tell you what I’m thinking: I just don’t believe that he would’ve done something this reckless. It just doesn’t seem like him.
Griffin: Alright, yeah, telling him a little bit about Rick, I think will help. Um, go ahead and roll [crosstalk] Plus Cool for Help Out.
Justin: [crosstalk] I did. It’s a ten. [Clint: Ooh!]
Griffin: It’s a ten, okay. On a ten, your help grants them plus one to their roll. So that brings you up to a ten on your investigate a mystery [crosstalk] so that allows you to—
Justin: [crosstalk] Plus two, so that’s 12.
Griffin: Oh shit, cool. Uh, so hold two, Ned, and you get to ask two questions off the Investigate a Mystery roll. Keeping in mind that, like, you’re just looking at a car, and so there’s a lot of stuff on here that’s probably not gonna— not gonna be especially relevant.
Clint: Alright, tell me— how do I word this, I’m going to investigate, really check out the brakes. [Griffin: Okay.] Check out the brake line and—
Griffin: The pedal, and just that whole brake system.
Clint: The whole brake thing, yeah.
Griffin: Okay, so that would be—
Travis: God, it’s like listening to Car Talk over here. [Clint and Griffin laughing]
Clint: [nasally voice] “What do we got, the pads? Check the pads! Are the pads alright?”
Travis: [same nasally voice] “I’m gonna look at the brake gum, and the sticky widgets.”
Griffin: Um, I think that would be a What Happened Here, so… yeah, so you check out the brake system. Underneath the car, and under the hood, there is— there’s nothing wrong. The brake system is totally fine. You know, the brake line is working, there’s brake fluid, everything seems very well and just in good operating order. Uh, mechanically speaking. You go and you check out the actual brake pedal, and the brake pedal is also fine. But while you’re down there, sort of looking around— and again, the front of the car is pretty well crumpled up, and I think you have a hard time even getting into the driver’s compartment to look at the pedals, you see something— I think, actually, it’s been moved over to the passenger side— there’s some bottles, like plastic bottles of, like, Gatorade— I think Rick was a big Gatorade fan, and so there’s just a few bottles of Gatorade. And there’s one that looks peculiar, um, that is over in the passenger side floor. And you pick it up, and it’s been kind of crushed— it’s been crushed, like, right in the center of the bottle, in like a very specific way, almost looks like it got stomped on. And as you are sort of looking at it, and you look at the brake pedal, you kind of surmise that the indent of the crush of this bottle is the exact same height of the brake pedal. And so you figure out what happened here is that this bottle got wedged under the brake pedal, and probably kept Rick from being able to brake. And so, just this freak accident kept him from being able to brake the car, and sent him to his demise. [crosstalk] You have one more question—
Clint: [crosstalk] Wow. That’s some Columbo shit, right there.
Griffin: Well, you rolled a ten. You got one more question.
Clint: What about the grill? As long as I’m in full blown Columbo mode, let me check out the grill.
Griffin: Um, okay. I don’t think there’s— yeah, there’s nothing really supernatural about the grill. There’s nothing especially weird, it just kind of looks like— and again, you’re not a forensic analyst, but it just kind of looks like this van hit a tree very hard, and got very messed up because of it. One thing— Duck, you are sort of there talking to Ned— one thing I think you noticed through the window into the van, and I don’t think this is investigate a mystery, because it’s just very, very apparent, it’s not something you would have to dig especially deep to realize: The van is empty. And he was an arborist, meaning he was responsible for if there was something seriously wrong with a tree, or some sort of rot that was plaguing the trees in the Monongahela forest, he would have like a lot of tools that he would use to, you know, safely scale the trees and prune it or help deal with it— there’s nothing in the van. All of these supplies and all of these tools are gone. They are not in the van.
Ned: Duck, my friend, I— I’m afraid that deep down body thirst cost your friend, Danimal, his life. [Griffin laughing] Looks like a bottle of Gatorade went behind the brake pedal and so [Duck sighs] this really does look like an accident. I think it also goes to prove that trying to stay in shape is bad for you, so.
Travis: The sour milk has claimed another victim.
Griffin: The sour sweat potion.
Duck: I, um… Ned, I appreciate it. I really— we do need to talk about your still-held belief that Gatorade is part of a healthy lifestyle, but we’ll get— I think there’s time for that. I, um, I appreciate you checking, anyway. You know, it was just a thought.
Ned: It does look like an accident, though.
Duck: Yep.
Griffin: Aubrey, let’s finish your badge theft, if this is something you wanna go through with. Again, these are side missions that you don’t have to do, it just helps you later on [crosstalk] with your Enchantment roll, but—
Travis: [crosstalk] Griffin, I am a fucking completionist.
Griffin: Yeah, I know, you wanna 100% this. [crosstalk] You wanna get all the towers—
Travis: [crosstalk] You can’t give me side missions. I’m gonna get all the feathers [Griffin: Sure] I’m gonna get all the flags. [Griffin laughing]
Griffin: Alright, um, so, what’s this trick look like? ‘Cause I can’t just let you say, “I do a magic trick, and now I have his badge.” There’s has to be some sort of challenge to it.
Travis: So I would say that there is a lot of like palming, but mostly it’s like, “Oh sorry, I thought it was here— oh, is it there?” You know, like, misdirect, his keys are now where his wallet was, and his wallet is now where that was, and that kind of thing. [Griffin: Okay] And there’s just a lot of patter, and I will say that now that he has introduced that he is a big David Blaine fan, I’m gonna go for kind of a David Blaine feeling reveal.
Griffin: You’re gonna eat the badge?
Travis: …No!
Griffin: I mean, that’s what David would do, but okay.
Travis: I mean, the reveal— well, the lie, is something along the lines of,
Aubrey: Alright, and boom! There you go, Dewey.
Dewey: …There what goes? Where’s my— where is it? You’re supposed to [Aubrey: Yeah] teleport it into an orange or somethin’, I cut into the orange to have myself a little citrus snack and then, damn, there’s my badge.
Aubrey: Dewey, I guarantee you by the end of the day, you— your mind? It’s gonna be blown.
Dewey: What does that mean, though? [crosstalk] ‘Cause I do—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Yeah. David Blaine.
Dewey: No, I’m tantalized, I’m just like [crosstalk] you promi—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] You’ve been Blained. I just freaked your bean.
Dewey: No, totally, but by the end of the day, you’re telling me [Aubrey: Yeah] I’m gonna find my badge again and Sheriff Zeke’s not gonna—
Aubrey: Well… I think you’ll be very surprised. Wink wink.
[Griffin laughing]
Travis: She says, she says wink wink. But she doesn’t wink. [Griffin: Okay]
Dewey: Alright. Well, I—
Aubrey: [magic noises]
Travis: And then maybe like, there’s a little flash. But it’s flash paper, this isn’t real magic. [Griffin: Okay] No, no, no.
Griffin: He says,
Dewey: Alright, well, I’ll keep an eye out. I guess I’ll keep—
Aubrey: [magic noises]
Dewey: Okay, alright, that actually hurts my eyes a little bit when you do it that close.
Aubrey: Yeah. Magic, ooh. Dewey, magic?
Dewey: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Alright, why don’t y’all head back to town, I’m seriously gonna get in my car ‘cause I’m just so fucking cold.
Griffin: Um, and as he sort of turns to walk back to the car, I think Ned and Duck, you all are already on your way back from the van. And he tips his cap and he says,
Dewey: Alright, um, y’all have a good day. Duck, again, I’m real sorry. I hope this doesn’t ruin your holidays, pal.
Duck: Yeah, thanks, I appreciate it.
Griffin: Uh, and he gets in his car.
Aubrey: Psst, Duck. I stole his badge? Am I gonna get in trouble?
Duck: Aw, man, I wish you hadn’t done that.
Aubrey: It’s for the, it’s for— ‘cause on the card?
Duck: I know, Aubrey [crosstalk] I get it.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] You said it was a badge!
Duck: Dewey’s a nice guy, I don’t know.
Aubrey: I’ll make it up to him!
Duck: Alright, but Zeke’s gonna have his ass, I don’t know how you’re gonna fix that, but…
Aubrey: Then I’ll steal Zeke’s badge, and I’ll give Zeke’s badge to Dewey—
Duck: Great. Yes. That’s—
Ned: Oh, this web of lies!
[Justin and Clint laughing]
Griffin: Um… you all drive away from the scene of the crash, and Dewey gets back into his car, and sits there for a while. I think he looks around his car for a while, looking to see if maybe you teleported his badge somewhere in his car, but he doesn’t find it. So he kinda sighs and smiles, like, ‘Oh no, where’s it gonna show up?’ Um, and then we sort of— we see the crash from the woods, up the hill, from above the crash, and there we see a figure on a snowmobile. And this figure is wearing a helmet, and was watching this scene intently, as it played out. Saw everything that happened, saw Ned and Duck investigating this car crash, and they probably should’ve seen— saw Aubrey stealing the badge of a sheriff’s deputy. And as you all drive off in the Lincoln, they turn the snowmobile and drive off back into the woods.
Travis: Is it one of them fucking Hornets?
Griffin: [sing-song] Hard move~! [speaking] So, uh, night starts to sort of descend as you all drive back down state route 66 and into town— you pass the turnoff into the Cryptonomica, and sort of drive into Kepler’s riverside. And those Christmas lights are sort of streaking by as you drive across the main drag toward the ascent back up to Amnesty Lodge on cliffside. And the temperature now that the sun is down has just plummeted, the streets are clear, nobody really wants to be out when it’s this cold. And then a single flake falls on the windshield of your car. And then it is followed by a sudden, frenzied storm, that starts to just completely cover your view. Outside, through the windows and the windshield, you can just barely see this storm being whipped about— these flakes are just being flung almost horizontally in your direction. And through this, you all see a figure, just for a moment, on the side of the road. It is a humanoid figure, wearing a brown robe that covers its entire, imposing frame. And, from a distance, you’d estimate to be easily eight feet tall, with broad shoulders and thick muscular arms. It’s got these two large bags of some sort, slung over its shoulders. And you can’t see its face behind the hood of its robe, but it stops and it turns to face you as you pass, just as the storm outside finally and completely covers your view. And then Ned, the engine of the Lincoln sputters in this storm, and then it backfires a few times, and then it just dies. And your car rolls to a stop. And then, moments later, the storm just completely disappears. What do you do?
Aubrey: Was it the Krampus?
Travis: [whispers] Griffin?
Griffin: I’m not gonna tell you if it’s the Krampus or not. But [mumbling] it’s probably not the Krampus.
Travis: [doubtful] Okay. That’s what the Krampus would say.
Griffin: [laughing] I’m gonna have to tell you if it’s the Krampus or else it’s entrapment.
Travis: Okay, thank you.
Clint: I can tell you who it was… it was Michael Jordan!
[gasps]
Travis: Hurry, masturbate him!
Griffin: Jake Cool-Ice actually says,
Jake: So, uh, you all saw that too, right?
Aubrey: That had the two scary bags? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ned: Did anybody notice if the bags were moving or not? ‘Cause that would be so much more creepy.
Jake: Um, no, I didn’t see anything like that… Ned, is the car done-zo? What—
Ned: I don’t know! You know, a lot of this me knowing cars is such hogwash anyway [Justin laughing] I mean, it looks like it’s full of gas, the radiator thing looks like it’s got radiator juice in it. I— god, where is the hood release? I can never find the hood release.
Travis: Okay, Aubrey gets out.
Griffin: Okay. Um, as you step outside you see that, indeed, there is no storm, there is just— it is just gone completely. Ned’s car has rolled to a stop in the middle of the street, sort of right in the heart of riverside. You just passed city hall and the massive Christmas tree out in front, and the few municipal buildings surrounding it. And on the other side of the main drag you’re on is a handful of the town’s staple businesses. There’s like a winter sports supply store, a Dave’s Dehumidifier Depot is here, Leo Turkesian’s general store is here, the Pizza Hut is here, it’s got this like towering, illuminated sign beckoning in drivers off the highway. And everything is just quiet.
Travis: And so we don’t see the figure now, right?
Griffin: It is gone. But you are fairly close by to where you just saw it.
Travis: Okay, well, I guess we go check out that area.
Griffin: You say ‘we’, is it you and [Aubrey: Well] Duck, are you heading with her?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t even think you need to investigate this, because I don’t think you necessarily need to— again, I think when there are things that are just obvious that you can just see with your eyes, and don’t require any sort of additional investigation, you don’t need to roll. You see tracks in the ground. You see hoofprints [Aubrey gasps] in the ground.
Aubrey: I knew it!
Griffin: And as you’re sort of standing there looking at these hoofprints that just sort of disappear from the place where they were standing, where you saw this figure— there is a payphone not too far away from where you are, about 10 feet away. And it starts to ring.
Travis: I look at Duck.
Duck: Yeah?
Aubrey: You get it.
Duck: You get it!
Aubrey: You—
Ned: [shouting] Somebody get the phone!
Aubrey: Okay. I’ll get it.
Griffin: You pick up the phone Aubrey, and a… sort of pleasant, sort of lilting voice answers, and this voice says,
Unidentified Voice: Hello, Aubrey. Can I speak to Duck Newton, please?
Aubrey: Uh, lemme see if he’s here. [Clint laughs] It’s for you?
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Duck: Uh, go for Duck?
Griffin: You take the phone and the voice says,
Unidentified Voice: Hello, Duck. In three minutes, your friend Leo Tarkesian is going to die. [Travis gasps] He will be crushed to death, as will the two customers currently shopping in his store. You might want to do something about that."

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Griffin: Aubrey we see you and you're back in your childhood home, several years ago. You are leaving it tomorrow. And then we see a car pull up just in front of your house with its lights off, with two figures silhouetted from within.
Duck: A friend of mine. He died last night, and there wasn't any foul play or anything suspected.
Ned: Looks like a bottle of Gatorade went behind the brake pedal and so... this really does look like an accident.
Griffin: You all see a figure on the side of the road wearing a brown robe. It's got these two large bags. There is a payphone, and it starts to ring.
Duck: Go for Duck.
Voice: In three minutes, your friend Leo Tarkesian is going to die. He will be crushed to death, as will the two customers currently shopping in his store. You might want to do something about that.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: The voice on the other end of the phone hangs up, Duck. And a stiff breeze blows down Kepler's main drag sending snow swirling around nearby buildings— the Pizza Hut, Dave's Dehumidifier Depot, and Leo's General Store, where he and his customers will apparently be crushed to death in a little under three minutes. What do you do?
Justin: How far away is it from here to there?
Griffin: So you are speaking, or you are currently holding the receiver of a payphone on the side of the road. You had just sort of passed the stretch with those businesses that I just mentioned, and I would say that you are probably about 100ft away. Not too far.
Duck: Alright, y'all, I need help now. I need— Aubrey, Ned, I need your help.
Aubrey: What? What do you need?
Duck: I need you all to help me clear Mr. Tarkesian's store. I just got a weird call that they're about to get—
Aubrey: Let's go!
Duck: —crushed. Alright. Good good good. Come on.
Ned: Okay.
Griffin: Jake says,
Jake: Do you need me on this too, or what's— what do you need?
Duck: Hell yeah, Jake. Just try to stay out of the way, man.
Travis: So I'm going to have Aubrey do a blast of heat to try to clear the snow. Right. Is there snow? Is it a hazard to run there?
Griffin: No. It may get in the way a little bit, but I don't know that it's bad enough that you need to— You are— I want to paint the scene for you. You're in the middle of the street, and there's maybe not anybody immediately around, but if you're gonna fucking, you know, go heat vision just to clear some snow in front of you... You can do that if you want, but it would be risky.
Travis: Okay then, instead she's gonna say,
Aubrey: Go go magic powers!
Travis: —and start running.
Griffin: Okay.
[Clint laughing]
Travis: So that's “Do one thing that is beyond human limitations.”
Griffin: What are you doing?
Travis: I'm running like the wind, Griffin, using my wind powers to buffer— to push me forward.
Griffin: I'm gonna push back on that 'cause I think that this— we need to maybe narrowly define ""something beyond human limitations"" 'cause if we say, like, you can get super speed whenever you want, that seems like— that seems like a pretty drastic sort of—
Travis: Can I push— push Duck forward?
Griffin: Sure, yeah. If you want to launch Duck forward— the blast of wind. I would allow that.
Travis: Let's go with that.
Griffin: Okay
Justin: So I'm running, I think the visual is, I'm running and he just blasts me from behind [laughing]
Griffin: Yeah, okay.
Justin: Alright, go ahead and do it.
Travis: So I rolled a nine plus two—
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: —so that's 11.
Griffin: So if that was a Use Magic, then you achieve your desired effect. Describe this.
Travis: So, like, as Duck is running I'm going to say, like— imagine, you know, like a strong wind. This is not a light breeze, as you described. This is like whoa, and it's going to propel him forward at a fast rate.
Duck: Guys! Look! I've awakened some sort of latent ability!
Aubrey: Okay just go, Duck!
Duck: Another one of my powers has returned! I never knew, but I'm incredibly fast!
Ned: Think happy thoughts, Duck! Think happy thoughts!
Duck: I'm trying, Ned, I'm trying. I don't know what's making this work, but look at me go! Holy shit, man!
Clint: Ned's going to Read a Bad Situation.
Griffin: Okay. I like that, so— I'm just trying to— because everything is kind of happening in real time and we do have a sort of very specific time table we're working with here, just to paint this scene, Duck is now flying full speed with the wind at his back towards—
Justin: Am I off my feet?
Griffin: I don't know, are you?
Justin: I didn't feel like I was. It felt like I was just running really fast.
Griffin: Yeah, I feel like for you it's like you're running down a hill really fast, and you know how— like that feeling of, like, you're running down a hill and you're like oh shit how do I stop? Like you have a lot of momentum but I don't think you're like Peter Pan flying.
Travis: And I rolled really good. So like [crosstalk] you're cool
Griffin: Yeah you're doing good. So Aubrey is sort of between— Aubrey ran forward to give you this extra push and I think you and Jake Coolice are still back towards the car, and you want to Read a Bad Situation.
Clint: Yeah, and I rolled an eight plus sharp, so that's a 10, and I think Ned is not the fastest of the bunch, but I think we're just kind of charging into this situation, and all Duck knows is “crushed.” I'm gonna look around and see if I can figure out what exactly is coming our way.
Travis: Also if this is a Die Hard 3 scenario, then they might be watching, you know? They might— the person who made the call—
Griffin: Oh, interesting.
Travis: —might be spying on Duck McClane.
Clint: What do I get for a 10?
Travis: You can have anything off this shelf.
[Laughing]
Travis: Anything.
Clint: Oh I want the ball— the ball in the cup game.
Travis: Oh, no I'm sorry, you gotta win twice to get the ball in the cup. You can have anything on this shelf between this one and this one. Anything between these two.
Griffin: Okay, so on a Read a Bad Situation you hold three, actually. You can ask what's my best way in, what's my best way out, are there any dangers we haven't noticed, what's the biggest threat, what's most vulnerable to me, and what's the best way to protect the victims.
Clint: Okay, well I'm gonna get to that one for my third one.
Griffin: [laughing] I figured.
Clint: A) is there— are there any dangers we haven't noticed?
Griffin: Hm. The danger here is— you see Aubrey cast this gust of wind that pushes Duck forward towards Leo's General Store, but you feel a wind too. And you're standing behind Aubrey. You feel this wind that is getting stronger. It's mounting, and— the snow storm that you all just sort of drove through, it's— this isn't that. There's just sort of a powerful gale that is starting to appear around you, and it's getting stronger.
Clint: Alright. What's the biggest threat?
Griffin: This wind is getting sort of stronger, like freakishly fast, and you hear this sort of sickening, loud, metallic groaning noise. And it's coming from the distance sort of right in front of you in the direction of Leo's shop and you see, starting to sway in the wind, in a kind of unnatural way, the gigantic Pizza Hut sign. [Clint gasps] The one that is designed to be seen from the nearby highway as drivers pass Kepler. It is— it's starting to sway in the wind a little bit, like a reed. Like a stalk of wheat, and this sign is enormous and it doesn't look like there's any way it should be doing this. That looks pretty dangerous to you. The big big Pizza Hut sign.
Clint: And what's the best way to protect the victims?
Griffin: You notice that the Pizza Hut sign is starting to bend a little bit towards its base, and the direction in which it's bending is in the direction of Leo's General Store. So the best way to protect the victims is to make them not be there [crosstalk] when this happens.
Clint: [crosstalk] In the store, yeah.
Ned: Folks! The sign. [fumbling] The-the-the-the sign— it's— that's what's going to be the crushing things that's gonna crush the people.
Griffin: Let's get back to Duck. Duck you are— it's been about a minute and you have, eh, maybe a minute and a half. You have made your way to the door of the general store. You side step the crates that he has set up outside that he sort of displays the fresh produce in every morning, and do a hop over this toppled over pile of bags of fertilizer as you make your way into the front door.
Duck: Ah shit. Everybody out! Clear the place. You're about to get squished by a Pizza Hut sign. Nobody wants to go out like that, come on.
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: You barge in the door just already saying this, and you have definitely been in Leo's, like, a ton. I think it is sort of the place that most folks go to get their groceries and sundries. And you would kind of have to be familiar with is to, like, know where to find anything here. It's like, a decent sized store, but its aisles are like cramped and towering, and they are stocked with just like everything you could ever need. What Leo has kind of invested in his inventory though, he has kind of scrimped on maintenance. There's, like— it's got this rustic sort of Alpine charm that a lot of the buildings in Kepler have, but there's like some bending beams sort of supporting the ceiling. There's some rusting metal supports for the air ducts kind of above. And knowing what you know, you just see disaster fucking all over this room. And as you sort of run in, sort of shouting for folks to get out, you see two people. You see Leo behind the counter— behind the register— and he is sort of talking idly with Janice, the town mail carrier. She's got her mail bag, and it's empty. She has finished up her day's route. The call on the line said there were two customers in here. You do not see a second customer. And Leo, as you barge in and start shouting, says,
Leo: Hey, okay hold up. Hold up. Calm down, there, a second Duck. What's—
Duck: There's no time, man. Come on. Get out of here. Trust me.
Leo: Duck, I don't— You gotta tell me what's going on. [crosstalk] You're freaking me out a little bit.
Duck: [crosstalk] I don't have—
Justin: I pull out my badge
[Justin and Clint laughing]
Griffin: Your—
Justin: [laughing] My forest ranger badge.
Griffin: Okay.
Duck: I'm a— I'm an officer of the law, in a sense, and I need you to get out of here now! Everybody! This place is about to get crushed. We can talk about it outside. Let's go.
Griffin: Janice says,
Janice: Oh— Okay Duck. You seem mighty spooked. I'll— I'll follow along.
Griffin: [crosstalk] and she—
Duck: Thank you, Janice.
Griffin: She goes out the door. Leo comes out from behind the counter and says, like
Leo: Okay now you— you're scaring off my customers now [crosstalk] Duck, and I don't know what you're playing at.
Duck: [Crosstalk] Alright Leo. Listen man. Do you want to remain three dimensional?
[laughing]
Leo: That would be ideal, yeah.
Duck: Then get the hell out of your store. It's about to be destroyed, okay. I can't explain how I know, but I know.
Griffin: Let's get back to— Let's go to Aubrey.
Travis: So look— Is this like a single pillar base of the sign?
Griffin: No. It's on one huge pole, and now it is— it looks like it could go at any second.
Travis: Rather than try to stop it, I'm gonna see if I can, like, melt one specific— like so that it timbers in the right direction.
Griffin: Oh interesting.
Travis: Yeah, so like rather than try— is there an area that it could go...
Clint: The street?
Griffin: I mean, you could— Dad was right, like the street direction is definitely— it would be safer. Yeah, I mean you could probably angle it towards Dave's Dehumidifier Depot [Travis gasps], which is kind of on the other side of the Pizza Hut.
Justin: Christ, hit that. I would hit that.
Travis: I would never!
Griffin: You can't guarantee that Dave's not in there, and you can't guarantee that, you know, dehumidifier shoppers— people in desperate need for less, sort of, moisture in the air— aren't in there, and do they deserve to die? More than the people in Leo's general store? I don't know. These are the kinds of hard moral decisions I want to put in front of you.
Travis: What I'm gonna do is just put a little english on it so that it hits, like, the back of the store instead of the middle, right? So there's significantly less damage, so maybe it like clips the back instead of just, like, splitting Leo's in the middle.
Griffin: Okay, I think— I mean I think this would be, like, an attack roll, right? I don't think that this would be— I don't think this fits anything that is in Use Magic. So—
Travis: Yes, I agree.
Griffin: —so this would be a Kick Some Ass.
Clint: Are you attacking the pole itself?
Travis: Yes I am, Father, and I did not do a good job.
Griffin: Yeah, you did a bad job.
Travis: I rolled a three. Plus—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Two is five.
Travis: —two. Five.
Clint: How 'bout if I help out?
Griffin: If you help out you can get it to a six, which is still a hard fail.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: Yeeep.
Griffin: Go ahead and mark experience there, Aubrey.
Travis: [rapidly] Yeeeeep yep yep yep. Yeeeeeeeep yep yep yep.
Griffin: What does it look like as you're trying to, like—
Travis: A ball of— more like a ball of fire. Like, I'm just trying to, like, you know... aim. Byoo, you know? Aahhh!
Griffin: I think you're hyped up in this moment. I think you are— I think your nerves are getting the best of you, and because we've kind of touched on— like that is where your— the power of— the um—
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: —the strength of your magic comes from, I think you are surprised when you cut clean through the pole.
Aubrey: Whoops.
Griffin: And with that, the wind finally catches the Pizza Hut sign like a sail, and it falls over into the store and, Duck, you hear a horrible horrible noise, Duck. And it's coming from directly in front of you. Suddenly, the lights are just gone, and you can sense, I think with whatever— wherever your powers are coming from, Duck, they're telling you, like, “Uh-oh.”, and you know that you need to get the fuck out of the way. What do you do?
Justin: I'm gonna tackle Leo, so like— and knock him to the ground so I'm on top of him.
Griffin: Okay. Roll to Act Under Pressure.
Justin: [Griffin chuckling] Seven plus—
Griffin: That is Cool.
Justin: —Cool. That's a nine.
Griffin: Okay. On a seven to nine I give you a worse outcome, hard choice, or price to pay.
Clint: Could I help him out?
Griffin: You're pretty far away, right?
Clint: I was just gonna yell out—
Justin: Now he— now I could make— you could make a very good argument that Ned is like—
Griffin: Timber.
Justin: Yeah exactly.
Griffin: Okay, yeah I think so. Go ahead and roll to Help Out. This is you sort of shouting to warn Duck and giving him a heads up.
Clint: And that's... a seven plus—
Griffin: Plus cool.
Clint: —plus cool. So that's eight.
Griffin: Okay. Your help grants them plus one to their role, but you also expose yourself to trouble or danger. Okay, I'll have to think of a way that I can do that.
Ned: Look out for the big ass sign!
Griffin: And I think that's what inspires you to leap onto Leo, and you do so, that is now a ten. On a ten you do what you set out to do. Here's what happens:
You hear Ned's voice. You hear the groaning of metal outside, and you leap forward and just tackle Leo. And then the Pizza Hut sign crashes into the room. I think for a second the lights go out as the sign sort of severs whatever electrical hookups they had here in the store, and there's no light in the room, and then there is light in the room. There's like a soft red and a soft white and a soft yellow light. I think you see, like, ‘Pizz’ from the sign. ‘Pizz Hu’ from the sign and a little bit of that red hat. [Justin laughing] and the huge thick wood beams that are in the ceiling of this room, a few of them have just given out completely. Right where it sort of smashed in it has given out completely, but a few of them kept. A few of them stayed strong and caught the sign. But you can— you hear things just falling apart in this room, sort of in a horrible cascade.
A few of the shelves have fallen over. One has fallen over, like, at an angle and landed right above you, showering you with, like, the goods that were on it. You have some cans of soup and some canned vegetables that sort of landed and pelted you as you landed on top of Leo. But it caught itself on another set of shelves and sort of saved you from some of the stuff that was falling from the ceiling, and now here's where you're at— and you get the impression that this— the rest of the building is not going to hold up for very long.
Justin: Okay. I gotta drag him out.
Griffin: Let's jump to— Before we get to that— Aubrey, you have just Pizza Hut-ed this store and seemingly probably killed Duck and—
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: —everybody inside. Just curious what you're doing right now.
Travis: So, I would say— It's like you said. From her point of view, right, like she has just... caused the building to collapse and kill Duck.
Griffin: Right.
Travis: The wind is knocked out of her for a second, and not like in a magical way, but, like, something unlocks? Something she hasn't thought about for a very long time. Something she has pushed away from the front of her mind, and like, I would say she starts crying in that way that if someone pointed it out she probably wouldn't even notice.
Griffin: Mmhmm.
Travis: And just, like— And, uh, collapses.
Griffin: Unconscious?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay. That— Usually I'm the one that knocks you guys unconscious, but you're just making it easier for me.
Travis: I know. I'm gonna say, not like unconscious uncon— but like,
Griffin: Yeah. No, she's in shock. She's—
Travis: Yes. Yes yes.
Griffin: Yeah. Okay. Cool. I guess we'll unpack that... in a bit. And I think let's get back to Duck. I think we have to sort of keep the tension going here. You are under a shelf, covered in cans, on top of Leo. There is— You got Janice out. There's maybe somebody else in here and the building's about to collapse. What do you do?
Justin: So basically, like, the building is— nobody's like—
Griffin: The sign is not done falling. It got caught by a couple beams in the ceiling. It had this— It had these, like, thick beams, and it didn't quite get through all of them, but whatever is holding the sign up is giving way quickly. And it's only a matter of time.
Justin: And it's still partially out of my— it's still partially out of the building? Like the top of the building?
Griffin: Yes.
[Justin sighs]
Duck: Ned! In the trunk!
Ned: What?
Duck: Get the Flymaster!
Ned: The rocket thing?!
Duck: The— yeah. Unless I missed my guess, the tags on that bad boy are 'fragile' [laughing] 'volatile' and 'quick' so I feel like maybe you got one shot to rocketeer that motherfucking sign off my dome, man.
Ned: Awww shit. Are you sure? You don't want me to, like, bring it to you?
Duck: No, I'm not fucking sure, but this is the best shot I got! Come on!
Ned: Alright. How— Okay.
Clint: So he— he throws it on. He buckles it up in the front.
[Griffin laughing].
Travis: Now Ned is good with vehicles— [crosstalk]
Ned: Is there a helmet?
Travis: —Just to establish.
Clint: Oh, that's right. Yeah. Vehicles.
Ned: Alright! How do I turn it on?
Duck: Umm. Shit. That's actually a real good question.
Ned: The dial on the front?
Duck: Is there a dial? Yeah, yeah. Try that.
Ned: Okay.
Clint: And the— and a radio comes on.
Duck: Nah, nah nah. Turn that off that's annoying. No. Ummm [clicks tongue]... Oh! Oh! Reach to the sides! there's like little handles there. See the tubes?
Ned: Oh. Yeah. Oh those are nice.
Duck: [crosstalk] Yeah, that's nice.
Ned: And they're contoured. They fit my hands.
Duck: Come on!
Ned: And there's a red button on the— [Ned screams off into the distance]
[laughing]
Griffin: Describe to me exactly— okay, alright. Ned’s now— okay, great.
Travis: Ned’s dead.
Griffin: Ned has died. So, dad, start working on another character, and Duck, we’ll see if you need to start working on another— no, okay. What are you— what’s the plan here? You are— I need to know how well— I need to know what you’re doing before we can decide how well it goes.
Clint: Alright, uh… well, I mean the only thing that I can see— There’s no way that we can get inside the building, so the only thing I can do is— he said “jetpack into the motherfucking sign,” so I’m gonna jetpack into the motherfucking sign!
Griffin: Alright, you’re just trying to collide with it really hard or are you trying to—
Clint: Well I think that if I move it, if I hit it hard enough, you know… maybe it’ll flatten out and not come through the hole?
Justin: Yeah, or he catches it and pulls it away.
Griffin: Yeah, I mean if you just shoot into it with your human body, you’re gonna get extremely hurt. You know that, right? If you put on— [Justin laughing] I gotta talk to you about it for a second, daddy, that if you launch yourself with a jetpack into a sign and you hit it going really fast that your body dies—
Clint: I have a large, striped—
Griffin: No, no, no—
Clint: I have my parka on!
Travis: Uh huh.
Clint: That’ll cushion it some!
Griffin: Let’s just think with our human— Let’s think about what our human bodies can do and what it can survive—
Justin: To bring everybody inside the bit, I was planning on doing this before Aubrey tried to kill me with a Pizza Hut sign, and I was thinking about how it would work pretty good ‘cause I’m so tough. And I kinda forgot about— when I suggested that Ned use his flesh to—
Clint: Now wait a minute, wait a minute… I’m not— If Ned zooms towards it, we’re talking about a large, roughly rectangular shaped sign, right?
Griffin: Uhh, yeah, I mean it’s in the shape of the Pizza Hut—
Clint: Alright, if we use leverage— if he zooms at it, hits the top part of it, and knocks it back, flattens it out, it’s not gonna come through the roof, ‘cause there’s more area [crosstalk] over the roof.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I’m loving this! Yes! Absolutely!
Griffin: I’m loving this! This is good— this is good science! Alright, go— I guess Act Under Pressure.
Clint: Okay.
Justin: Literal air pressure in this case, eh?
Clint: Act Under Pressure… what do I add to that?
Griffin: Cool.
Clint: Seven plus one, that’s eight.
Travis: Well.
Griffin: Alright. Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna give you a Worse Outcome, Hard Choice, or a Price to Pay.
Clint: Price to Pay.
Travis: You don't get to pick.
[laughing]
Travis: [crosstalk] That's not how life works ever.
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh okay. I thought you were being Monty Hall for a minute.
Travis: But you're not— Like, it doesn't work in life. If you get hit by a car, God's not like ""so what do you want?"" [Travis laughing] ""What way do you want to go with this, Clint?""
Griffin: Yeah, uh, I'm gonna hurt you really bad.
Clint: Okay. I can live with that. Listen, just for the moment of zooming along in a rocket pack is worth any price.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: It's a fun choice of words to say ""I can live with that.""
Griffin: Yeah. That— that remains to be seen. But you— boy. What's this look like? You tell me now. This is your— This is your last act on this earth, and I want you to tell me how it looks.
Clint: The rocket pack fires up when he hits the red button, and while it would be really cool to envision him as, you know, sleek and aerodynamic, I think he's waving his arms and legs like crazy [laughing] and just flailing around for the first couple of seconds, and then maybe stretches his arms out to act like wings, and then stretches his legs out and tries to angle towards the upper part of the sign.
Griffin: Okay. You achieve that. And it is— it is clumsy, It does not look very smooth. It does not look very cool. I think that Janice, the mail carrier, sees you from her spot, she is just taking off running, especially as the sign fell in through the— in through the building. And she just sees this sort of column of smoke do a curly-Q in the air, and I think by the time— when you actually make contact with the sign, I think you flipped around so that the jetpack itself catches the brunt of the damage because you get the sense if your skull had been the recipient of it you would have just— you would die. You would have been dead very very quickly.
Clint: Yeah. [crosstalk]
Travis: But instead you died slowly.
Justin: Yeah instead it's kind of a slow death kind of thing.
Griffin: Well, instead, Duck, from you— you're looking up from your position, and you see just sparks shoot into the air— shoot through the air. And Ned, you just— you are instantly unconscious. You are instantly unconscious from this huge amount of blunt force trauma you experience. Your body sails 20 feet past the sign and rolls to a stop sort of smoking in the snow. And the Flymaster, I think it keeps on going. I think it comes unlatched from you, and it skitters to a stop, like, 50 feet past you. It sort of dances across the snow, sort of flying past your unconscious form. And you take four harm.
Travis: I'm sure we'll find that again later.
Griffin: Ned, I need you to mark Unstable. On your harm tracker.
Clint: Oooooo.
Griffin: If you do not get medical attention now, you are... going to die.
Clint: Alright. Unstable. And then mark four harm?
Griffin: Yes. With that, though, the sign— it teeters on the edge of the building and sort of slides off. You blast into this motherfucker so hard that you completely push it just... off. Off the building. And it slides harmlessly off the back. And with that, Duck you— Leo is— Leo's kind of scr— you know, he was screaming for a second as his store was destroyed, and he's calmed down, and he says,
Leo: Okay, uh, next time I will listen up. [fumbling] Can we— you got— we gotta get out of here. I-I-I— I don't want— I— we— we gotta get Denny from the bathroom. He was— he was in the bathroom. We gotta get him. We gotta get—
Duck: Calm down, alright? Listen. I got a plus two cool. So we're— I'm gonna get you through this. Alright? You get out, I'll get Denny off the can... and— and then we'll— I don't know, we'll call the... the sheriff down here and start the insurance stuff. But get out now. I'll go get Denny. Don't worry.
Griffin: You can already hear sirens in the distance. I think that this is, you know, happening on the main drag, and folks definitely saw a Pizza Hut sign, you know, teeter and fall into a business. I think that you definitely hear sirens on the way. I also don't think, like— I think the danger has passed. The sign is now off the building. It's not going to fall in and collapse, and I think Denny and Leo and you are able to get out of the store without any danger, and you see Aubrey on the ground by the sign where it fell. And I don't know if you see Ned.
Duck: Aubrey! Hey! Hey! Aubrey!
Justin: I rush over to her first, I think. She's right there.
Griffin: Sure.
Duck: Aubrey, did— did you knock over the sign? Aubrey?
Aubrey: [quietly, to herself] I killed Duck...
Duck: No— What?
Aubrey: [quietly] killed Duck.
Duck: Aaahh no. This is a ghost thing, isn't it? Hey Leo! Can you see me?
Leo: [confused] Yeah I can see you. You— you look a little shaken up, and you got some soup on you—
Duck: Alright nevermind that's fine. Hey, Aubrey, I'm not dead. Look.
Aubrey: [quietly] Not again, no. No.
Duck: No no no, Aubrey, look look look. I'm not dead.
Justin: God, hold on. Duck probably travels with a first aid kit of some sort, right? Like, doesn't that— [crosstalk] does that track for you?
Travis: [crosstalk] Like a cool, like, fanny pack.
Justin: Like, as a ranger? It seems like he would have, like, some [crosstalk] bare necessities... first aid stuff
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, in his pack, I think he definitely has— Yeah, I mean this is not your primary job, but I think if you're on the trail doing your sort of forest tending and you come across somebody who's injured themselves, you definitely want to be prepared. So yeah, I think in your sort of all day carry you've got some supplies for first aid.
Justin: Alright. I'll grab that up and get out the space blanket that I keep in there.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And pull out— 'cause I can recognize— I think I probably recognize shock.
Griffin: Alright. Yeah. You get that all wrapped around Aubrey, and I think at this point an ambulance from St. Francis has pulled up, as have a couple of squad cars from the sheriff's station. You see Sheriff Zeke and Deputy Dewey step out of those. And immediately some EMTs rush out of the ambulance and towards the building, looking for anybody who has gotten injured. And they do a— quickly poke their head inside and they kind of get waved off by the sheriff, who doesn't want them to, you know... doesn't want the building to collapse on them. And one of the EMTs points off in the distance, and Duck, you see two EMTs rush over with their supplies and start tending to Ned, who you now see face down in the snow.
Justin: Alright, I would rush over there next.
Griffin: Alright. He looks very bad. Whatever coat he was wearing now just has a big burn mark on the back of it. And you don’t see any- it’s not gruesome; it’s not like there’s bones jutting out of Ned, but he looks bad. The EMTs are working on him, and one of them says:
EMT: Do you know what happened to him?
Duck: Um… oh boy… do you want the truth or a more convincing lie? Um, nah so, okay, right… so the Pizza Hut sign started to fall, ‘cause of the weather, and he ran up there on… a fire escape… and tried to push it? …With a bat? Damn it. Nah, he just pushed it, and it fell, and then he fell ‘cause he got shocked. I bet… I didn’t see. Ah, shit! Alright, hey guys, rewind. I was inside, I didn’t see anything! I don’t know… this man. I do know this man. Fuck!
[Griffin laughs]
Duck: Alright, so this man’s name is Ned, and he’s a friend of mine, and I don’t know what the hell happened to him, but you know this guy. He’s always getting into something. I don’t know, I was in the building, I almost got killed by a Pizza Hut sign. I might be in shock!
Travis: [laughing] This is where we find out that Duck got his nickname because one time, he tried to explain something to someone, and it just kept autocorrecting “fuck” over and over again!
[Commercial break 32:04-37:18]
Griffin: It’s been a few hours since the accident. It was a few very stressful hours, maybe especially for you, Duck, because you were the only one fully cognizant during all of this… you rode in the ambulance with Aubrey and Ned to the hospital. Leo came, too, he just felt bad about abandoning you all after you went to such great lengths to help try and save his store and the people inside of it. And it’s been a few hours, you’re in a recovery room with Aubrey—and I think, Aubrey, at this point, you have recovered from the state that you were in, right in the immediate aftermath of the sign falling over—and Ned is there, also. He is in bed, and he’s hooked up to machines and an IV, and… I think you’re in and out, Ned. I think you’re doing better; they’ve stabilized you, and go ahead and remove 1 Harm, to get yourself back up to 3 Harm.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: That is for Ned, not for Duck.
Justin: Just listening.
[Clint laughs]
Justin: ...Active listener.
Griffin: You all are in the room together, Leo is waiting out in the hallway, and Mama showed up a few minutes ago after she heard what happened. And that is the scene, you—Duck—and Aubrey and Mama are debriefing about what just happened. And Mama’s kind of got her hand on Ned’s knee, and just pats it a couple of times, making sure he knows, like, “hang in there, bud”, and she says:
Mama: Alright, so, walk me through all this again. You all saw some sort of hooded, hooved figure out in the snow, whipped up a snowstorm, y’all couldn’t see, car stalled out, and then… you got a heads-up that the Pizza Hut sign was about to fall on Leo’s general store.
Duck: Yeah, that’s correct.
Mama: And they knew it was you who was gonna answer the phone.
Duck: Right.
Mama: What did they sound like? Did you get any idea of who it might’ve been? Was it somebody you knew, was is a voice you recognized?
Duck: [sarcastic] Uh… it was a few weeks ago, so I’m havin’ trouble remembering if I recognized the voice. Let me think about it, hold on.
[Griffin laughs]
Justin: And I pray.
Griffin: [laughing] Why?
Justin: [laughing] I pray to Griffin to remind me if I recognized the voice or not.
Griffin: You didn’t. You definitely didn’t.
Duck: Nah, Mama, I didn’t recognize the voice at all.
Mama: Well shit, man, I dunno. I guess we can wait and see if they reach out again. Did it seem like they were friend or foe? I mean, obviously, they gave you a heads-up, but who’s to say they weren’t the ones—
Aubrey: Mama, there was magic.
Mama: There was magic?
Aubrey: Yeah, the wind… the wind was not normal.
Duck: Yeah, something strange was goin’ on.
Aubrey: It felt like a lot of stuff, like… it felt like we were jinxed.
Duck: I got a thought: it was a call into a payphone, right? So, maybe we could, like… track it? Like, find out who’s called that payphone or somethin’.
Mama: I mean, if nobody else’s called it or used that payphone since, we could Star 69 it and see—
Duck: Hell yeah! One: that’s hysterical; secondly, that’s a great idea!
Aubrey: I mean, it’s one of two things: either it’s the person who knew the sign was gonna fall down ‘cause they made it happen, or it’s a person who knew somethin’ was gonna happen who might be able to help us in the future.
Mama: Alright, well, we gotta chase any clue we can get! We gotta get to that payphone before someone else can use it or recieve a call.
Griffin: And Jake stands up from the corner of the room, and he says:
Jake: Yeah, this is somethin’ Jake can do.
Griffin: And he pulls out his board and just goes running out of the room.
Duck: Now, Jake, wait! Can you remember the number?
Jake: Yeah, it’s the star-shaped button and then the funny sex joke.
Duck: You got it, Jake! I’m real proud of you, go get ‘em, partner!
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: He gives you a big thumbs-up and a finger gun, and he runs out of the room.
Duck: [yelling] Not 420, Jake!
[Griffin laughs]
Duck: … God damn it, he’s gonna hit—
Clint: [yelling] You’re gonna want to do 420!
Duck: [yelling] You’re gonna wanna do 420, Jake!
Travis: I would say, at this point, Aubrey looks over and, like, Ned’s eyes are closed, and she says:
Aubrey: [sullenly] Hey, Duck, could you go get me a coffee from the vending machine at the end of the room? I don’t care if it’s gross vending machine coffee, I would love it.
Duck: Yeah. Do you want any cream?
Aubrey: No.
Duck: Any sugars?
Aubrey: Nope. Just black, please.
Duck: What if it has, like, a mocha? Do you want a mocha kind of thing?
Aubrey: Duck, just black coffee, please.
Duck: Do you want a small or a medium or a large? You have any size—?
Griffin: There’s tons of options.
Clint: Grande? You could get a grande?
[crosstalk]
Justin: Ned, you’re asleep, hold on…
Duck: [sarcastic, overdramatic] Oh, thank god! Aw, Ned’s okay, y’all! He’s talkin’ normal and he’s all fine! He sounds like Clint McElroy, beloved DJ!
[Clint imitates Ned passing out]
Aubrey: [sarcastic] Aw, he’s back down.
Duck: [sarcastic] He’s back down.
Aubrey: The biggest they got, Duck. Just the biggest, cheapest, blackest coffee they got.
Mama: Make that two, Duck, if you don’t mind.
Duck: Okay, Mama, do you want cream or anything...?
Mama: Nah, I’m good. Just literally the same exact order. Why don’t you git, I think Aubrey’s trying to have a delicate conversation.
Duck: Same size, or…?
Mama: It’s gonna be a delicate conversation, Duck, why don’t you git.
Duck: I just wanna make sure you’re gettin’ taken care of, they got those li’l [unintelligible]
Griffin: Mama walks and opens the door up.
Duck: Aw, I get it. [Mama: Yeah, go git.] Alright, sorry about that—yeah, yeah, I’ll be… yeah. Damn it.
Griffin: Duck is out of the room, and now it is just an unconscious Ned and Mama and you, Aubrey.
Justin: Should I take my headphones off?
Griffin: No, ‘cause we got stuff.
Travis: You can know this shit.
Justin: [defensive] I dunno, it’s kinda fun!
Travis: Because I want you, the player, to know so we can get back to it and work it back into the story—
Griffin: Yeah.
[crosstalk]
Travis: Because we’re all writing it and—
Justin: Got it.
Clint: But would Ned know? ‘Cause he’s kinda semi-conscious…
Travis: Maybe he will and you’ll see if that comes up, maybe that’s why you’re in the fucking room, Clinton!
Griffin: We’re playing this together, it’s all happening in real time! It’s like if we just fuckin’ forgot!
Travis: Will you just fuckin’ write a story—
Clint: I’m really into character!
Travis: Write the fucking story with me! We are New York Times bestselling authors!
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Alright. Mama is here alone with you, Aubrey, she says:
Mama: Aubrey, what’s goin’ on? You seem really shaken up, obviously it was a tough night, but… did somethin’ happen?
Aubrey: Mama, do you remember when we met at the magic show, and you saw me do magic, and I told you it was the first time?
Mama: Yeah? You’re talking about actual magic, right?
Aubrey: Yeah. …I don’t think it was the first time.
Mama: What do you mean? Did you remember somethin’? What… what other time has there been, Aubrey?
Aubrey: When I was 18… the night I was leavin’ home… someone broke into our house, two men, I don’t know… I was runnin’ to see what the sound was and I tripped and hit my head on the banister of the stairs. And when I woke up, the house was on fire. …And I think that was… my fault…
Mama: [sigh] Shit, Aubrey. I mean, do you know that for sure, Aubrey? Or is this just the guilt, maybe?
Aubrey: The fire started on the second floor, where I was, and they were breakin’ in downstairs, and I… never really… thought about that… before now. It’s like I can… almost remember it.
Mama: I mean, that might be relevant. If it’s true, Aubrey, then that means that your magical abilities don’t have anything to do with you bein’ in Kepler or close to the gate or close to Sylvain—a lot of our theories about that are shot, but… I’m sorry about your house burnin’ down, that must’ve been hard.
Aubrey: …My mom died in the fire. Dad got out, but… the part my mom was in collapsed.
Griffin: I don’t think she knows how to respond to that. She just stands there, mouth open, for a bit and… wraps you back up in that blanket, and… I think she doesn’t know what to do, because she brought you here, and then she disappeared for a couple months, and then she showed back up. And I don’t know what your relationship has been like since then? But I think she takes a beat and then she leans down, and she just wraps the blanket around you and gives you a little kiss on the top of the head. And she says:
Mama: I’mma go see what’s taking Duck so long with that coffee.
Griffin: Okay. Before we do anything else, I have a super super super important question for Ned... and that question is going to determine some stuff based on what the answer is, but, how much of that did Ned... actually hear?
Clint: I think he heard... I think he heard all of it. I think he's not exactly in a coma—
Griffin: No.
Clint: —but I think he's out of it enough that he's— he's not feigning unconsciousness, but I think he heard the whole story.
Griffin: Then I think Ned has just had a pretty horrible...
Clint: [chuckling] Extremely horrible.
Griffin: ...realization.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: Then I think, in this sort of, like, in and out of consciousness state that you're in, you hear all of this, and you are taken back to that night. And I think you just see little bits and pieces of it in this state [underscoring starts]. I think you probably bonked your noggin something fierce when you did your jetpack stunt, and so, it's not coming to you in one sort of linear thread, but you remember pulling up to the house... and you remember doing a quick lap around it to find the best entrance, to check for security. You remember going inside. You remember carefully taking things. You remember getting caught. And you remember the car crash with your partner during your speedy escape, as Aubrey speaks from what seems like miles away and you realize... it was her house that you robbed that night. [underscoring ends]
Griffin: Hey, Duck. You're out in the hallway, right? You were getting coffee?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: I think you see Leo out there. Leo looks pretty shaken up as you come back with the two cups of joe. He's sitting there and he's kinda got his head in his hands.
Duck: Uhh... Hey. Leo. How's it going? You alright?
Griffin: He looks up. He kinda wipes his nose. He says,
Leo: Nah Duck, I'm not doing good— very good at all, thanks. Thanks for asking. I know— I'm sorry. I'm— I shouldn't yell. I'm sorry that was mean of me. I just... that was my fucking store, Duck, and it's gone now. I mean there's parts of it still standing and maybe there's a few, you know, boxes of cereal that didn't get smushed. But uh... that was my— that was my life, Duck. When I came to Kepler, I moved down here from New York and I didn't— I didn't— I didn't have anything, and... I'd just gotten out of a sort of long-term gig, and then... I didn't have nothing and that was hard for me and I didn't know what my purpose was and I found that store and that was my purpose and it was a good— it was a good purpose, but... uh... fuck, Duck, man. It's just... It just sucks.
Duck: Yeah. Yeah. There's no arguing about that.
Leo: I guess I'm still around to maybe rebuild, and I guess that's entirely thanks to you, so... I knew the people were gonna be good neighbors here in Kepler, Duck, but I didn't expect that kinda— that kinda treatment, so I don't know what to say, man. I don't know how I can repay you.
Duck: Well, you know, it's the least I could do. I'm sorry, you know, about the store... What about... I see people, like— what about Kickstarting. Is that a thing? Can you Kickstart it?
Leo: Like a motorcycle? What do you— Like—
Duck: Nah, you like— I think... I don't actually know. I've just seen sometimes when there's a fire or whatever, or like... some people Kickstart it. I don't know how you get in on there or if you just ask, or... or what.
Griffin: He says,
Leo: I guess I'll go to the library and see where I can find out. Um... you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get a lawyer, and I don't know nothing about law stuff, but it seems like I might be able to get a little bit of money out of the Pizza Hut, right?
Duck: Yeah, I mean, Pizza Hut's kinda— hey, do you not have insurance?
Leo: I do, yeah, I do, but it's gonna take a little bit for that to come through. In the meantime maybe I can get a few free personal pan 'zas out of it.
Duck: Yeah.
Leo: And that's what I can do for you. I'll split you some of the 'zas.
Duck: Yeah. You're being— I'll be honest, Leo, you're being kinda despondent for a guy who maybe just has to wait a little while and get a check to fix up his store, ya know? You're seeming out in the hallway a little bit like... doom and gloom, when really what you got is kind of an unplanned vacation, you know? You'll get up and runnin' again... just let the gears of... uh... State Farm start turning.
Leo: You got a point there, Duck. It's just... it's been my experience that when you find your calling in this life... it doesn't make any sense to put off doing it. You know what I mean? I'm gonna head out. I'm gonna head back to the shop. I better take stock of what's still standing. But— you... you take care of yourself Duck. I don't know what Kepler'd do without you.
Duck: Alright. Fair enough.
Travis: So now you have a bond with Leo Tarkesian.
Justin: [crosstalk] A life bond. Can't wait to summon him.
Griffin: [laughing] You get his summon crystal. [Justin laughing]. You throw it to the ground and it shatters.
Justin: I take it to the fairy godmother and she— [Justin laughing]
Griffin: Mmhmm. And I think as he walks by, he brushes past Jake, who comes running back in. He's got a lot of snow up on his pants. He's got his board that he's got slung over his back, and he runs up to you Duck, and he says,
Jake: [out of breath through the entire conversation] Oh God.
Duck: You okay?
Jake: Oh my God. Yeah, it's just. I ran really fast and I... I snowboarded— I cross-country snowboarded some of the way. But I got to the payphone.
Duck: Well, what's the number?
Jake: I had the phonebook so I ran the number in there.
Duck: [crosstalk] You— you ran the number in there? What?
Jake: And I found— Yeah. I went through all the numbers one by one and I found the phone number.
[Justin and Travis laughing]
Travis: Wait, what? No wonder he's tired, that would have taken days!
Jake: Is that weird? I just went through it really fast.
Travis: Oh God, he's a Beholder.
Jake: So I just— oh my God. Can I have— ?
Griffin: He takes one of the cups of coffee and just, like, slams it.
Duck: Yes. Go for it man, shit.
Jake: That hurt my mouth really bad... but... the number that called you. It was from the Eastwood Campground, and uh, RV Park. That was the— I'm gonna fuckin' die, man.
Duck: The... where?
Jake: The Eastwood Campground and RV Park. That's what the phone number said.
Travis: Is that where we first met Pigeon?
Griffin: Umm... No. Duck, I think you would know this as more of a sort of long term RV park. Not quite like a— like a trailer park, but for folks who maybe want to like walk part of the trail— like, the Appalachian Trail— and leave their Winnebago or what have you in a secure spot. This is sort of more of a long term rental place.
Justin: Alright.
Griffin: And as he tells you the source of the telephone call, you hear the phone ring inside of Ned's room.
Travis: [hesitantly] Aubrey answers it.
Griffin: Okay.
Aubrey: Yeah— He— Hello?
Griffin: Aubrey, you hear that voice that you heard earlier this evening on the payphone, and this voice says,
Voice: Well done! I have to say, as someone who's tried to defy the whims of fate myself a fair number of times, I— I didn't think you'd actually pull it off.
Aubrey: Listen... Um... Hi. Thank you for your help? Who are you?
Voice: That is a complicated question, Aubrey, one that will make a lot more sense when we meet tomorrow afternoon at my home. Once Ned is back up and on his feet again. My name is Indrid Cold. That was the name I was born with in Sylvain. It's a— it's a nice name… I've always thought. Perhaps a bit on the nose. A bit, you know, supernatural sounding. But there's nothing I can do about that, can I? But I think you're asking a different question.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Voice: I'm known as something different to the folks of this area. It's a nickname I picked up when I was younger and a bit more careless about my public persona. I don't prefer this title, myself, but, well... I'm the Mothman! See you tomorrow!"

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Griffin: I think you are surprised when you cut clean through the pole.
Aubrey: Whoops!
Griffin: And with that, the wind finally catches the Pizza Hut sign like a sail, and it falls over into the store.
Duck: Rocketeer that motherfucking sign off my dome, man!
Ned: Are you sure? You don’t want me to, like, bring it to you?
Duck: No, I’m not fucking sure, but this is the best shot I got! Come on!
Griffin: You are instantly unconscious from this huge amount of blunt force trauma you experience.
Jake: The number that called you. It was from the Eastwood Campground, and uh, RV Park.
Griffin: You hear the phone ring inside of Ned's room.
Voice: My name is Indrid Cold. I’m known as something different to the folks of this area. I don't prefer this title, myself, but, well... I'm the Mothman! See you tomorrow!
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Justin: [singing in a country style] Take me away to adventure— come on, take me to adventure. The zone that you know, that I know, that you took me to once before [Griffin sighs] when I was just a young preacher’s daughter [Griffin: Oh boy!] You showed me the way to the zone, the Adventure Zone. Take me again— only twenty dusty years have passed between then and now, but I still think fondly back to the trip that you took me to the zone, that Adventure Zone. Take me again! To that [warbling] Adventure Zone.
Clint: Bobbie Gentry is back.
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t actually have that much planned for this episode [Clint laughs] so if you could just do that for an hour, that would be actually good. And it would buy me a couple weeks to actually write some shits.
Justin: That’s the new theme song to The Adventure Zone, that I will repeat at any point… and thank you Dad, it is inspired by the work of Bobbie Gentry she’s been out of the picture for, uh, thirty-something odd years, so I’m stepping in to fill the gap.
Travis: Inspired by Cocaine and Rhinestones?
Justin: Yeah, indeed, yeah.
Travis: Mmm. My new favorite podcast. I’m pushing it here.
Griffin: And they’ve done a lot of prep work probably on that show, um [Clint laughs] they’ve done a lot of research for their episode, and maybe they didn’t spend the last, like, ten days on a whistle-stop tour of our country’s beautiful south eastern little panhandle zone. So, um, this is just us, a minisode, telling you go listen to Cocaine and Rhinestones, they’ve done their work.
Justin: You wanna hear my song again?
Griffin: Um, I mean, can you add like eighteen more stanzas onto it? Cause— no, let’s just play.
Travis: So we pick back up in the hospital room, and Aubrey’s still on the phone, and she says,
Aubrey: I’m sorry, did you say Muffin Man?
Griffin: I was actually planning on fast forwarding a little bit.
Travis: Oh, okay.
Justin: Alright, I’ll do, uh… okay—
Travis: Now you do a joke, Justin. No, wait, you did one. Dad, you do a joke.
Clint: Okay… uh, what do you call a mothman without any wings?
Griffin: What?
Clint: … A man?
[sincere laughter]
Griffin: Alright, alright, alright!
Travis: It was the delivery, the delivery got me real good.
Clint: I saved it with my delivery.
Griffin: Um, so I wanna jump forward to the following afternoon after yesterday’s sort of hectic events. And the three of you are at the Eastwood Campground and RV Park, the location that Jake Cool-Ice pulled out of the phone book, using his… just sort of remarkable phone book scanning technology. Ned, you’re feeling better after a night’s sleep—
Clint: Holy crap, really?
Griffin: Well, you woke up and you didn’t suffer severe head trauma as the doctor’s might have feared at first, and they were a bit— they had some reservations about releasing you from the hospital, discharging you. But you have recovered fairly well Go ahead and recover one more Harm.
Clint: Oh, okay! So not dead, not dead?
Griffin: Oh, you were never dead, you were unstable, but then you— you should’ve healed one while you were in the hospital, which would’ve made you stable again, and now you’re at two harm. So you know, you’re pretty bruised up.
So, you are all at the Eastwood Campground and RV Park, where this telephone call— these two telephone calls, rather, seemed to have originated from. Mama and Jake have headed back to the Lodge for the day, getting some work done there. And, yeah, so there is still some snow on the ground, it is the middle of December, after all, and this campground and RV park is fairly empty, as it’s the middle of the winter, there’s not too many campers out. This RV park is kind of a tacky looking place, I think there’s a lot of different camping opportunities in Kepler and the eastern Monongahela Forest area, and this is not one of the, sort of, more natural ones. And, in fact, it is mostly empty, there is just one vehicle parked out here. It’s got its stuff all connected to the different utilities coming out of this box, it’s got some water running into it— it is, in fact, a big, old, boxy, long beast of corrugated metal, just this hideous brown thing with a racing stripe zig zagging across the car, making the tall proud W just outside the driver’s compartment. It is a beautiful Winnebago, and there’s some light flickering sort of gently against the tinted windows, sort of suggesting that there is somebody inside.
Aubrey: Duck, you should… knock?
Duck: Well, now— why me? Why’ve I been, uh, nominated for this illustrious honor?
Aubrey: You’re an authority figure. [crosstalk] You have a hat.
Duck: [sigh] I mean, I watch over trees, I’m basically a wood elf with a flashlight.
Aubrey: Yeah, but I don’t have a flashlight. Ned doesn’t have a flashlight. You have a flashlight, and a hat, and a badge? Do you have a badge?
Justin: I’ll tap on the window.
Travis: Okay.
Duck: Uh, excuse me? Hello?
Justin: What do I see? What do I see inside?
Griffin: It’s pretty well tinted, you actually cannot see inside through the windows. But as you tap, the front door to the Winnebago just opens up. And the man who opens the door is— he is just, he is fascinating to look at. He’s kinda gaunt, he’s kinda withering away, but he looks confident and strong as he answers the door to face you. He looks— he looks young, but also kind of wrinkled? He’s got short, silver hair with hints of black peeking through? He’s wearing a tank top and some jeans, and you feel this burst of hot air as the door swings open, and that’s likely from the fleet of space heaters you can now see inside the Winnebago that is keeping his habitat a suitable temperature. And he’s wearing this pendant of this orange, crystal material, but his most eye-catching feature are his glasses. They are large, and round, and just this impenetrable, reflective red— you all catch your reflection in them as he answers the door, and he says,
Indrid: Okay, go ahead.
Aubrey/Indrid: [simultaneously] Uh, where are your wings?
Indrid: Obviously, you can’t see them right now because I’m wearing my disguise. Would you like to see my wings?
Aubrey/Indrid: Yes.
Indrid: I don’t know you very well, so no, not quite yet.
Aubrey: Then why did you ask?
Duck: Seems, like, kinda crappy, to just offer like that and yank it away.
Ned: Uh, Fitainly would— pardon my rude friends, hello, I’m—
Ned/Indrid: Ned Friendly Chicane.
Indrid: Um, yes, I know who all of you are— conversation is difficult for me because I’m always going to be just a little bit ahead. Um, but if you—
Aubrey/Indrid: What am I gonna say now?
Indrid: Yeah, it’s—
Aubrey/Indrid: Ah, nice, nice.
Indrid: So, um, yeah, come on in, we have important things to discuss, and not much time to discuss them, if my estimations are correct.
Aubrey: Real quick, over here, a little parley over here, if you don’t mind.
Duck: Uh, it seems like a weird time, but sure, what’s up?
Ned: Hm?
Aubrey: [whispering] We need to get his glasses.
Duck: Need to get his glasses? What?
Aubrey: Yeah, the bounty, a seer’s spectacles.
Ned: The Marmaduke thing.
Duck: Ah, damn, alright. Well, that’s something we’re gonna keep in our pocket when it makes the most sense, but you are right, thank you for the reminder. We will steal this man’s— [Justin and Clint laughing] Lemme try to say that again in a cool way. [lowers voice] We will steal this man’s glasses— [regular voice] You know, it’s funny… it feels mean. No matter how many different ways I say it, it does feel like a mean, non-heroic action, if I’m being honest.
Ned: Well, thank god one of us has experience in stealing things that doesn’t belong to him.
Duck: … Yeah, but glasses, man. [Duck laughing] I mean, it just seems kinda fucked up.
Aubrey: Maybe he’s got a spare pair? Like, he’s got like a—
Duck: I’m not gonna steal his glasses, if y’all want to for another, I don’t know, experience point? Zenni? I don’t exactly know what we’re stealing stuff for, but if y’all want to, you go nuts.
Griffin: Uh, he motions you all inside, and you enter his Winnebago. And it is—
Ned: Holy moly, it’s hot in here!
Griffin: — it’s hot as hell, I think you all feel the sort of impulse to remove your winter outerwear, and sort of protect yourself against the searing heat coming off of these four space heaters that are kind of precariously plugged in to one big chunky power strip. It is… not the cleanest in here. It is not the cleanest space you’ve ever been in. It almost kind of reminds you of Mama’s office, pre-Barclay cleaning it up. There is a sort of map of Kepler up on the wall with so many pins in it that you actually kind of have a hard time deciphering, ‘Oh, this is in fact a map of Kepler’. Um, there is just like dirty dishes all over the place. You see, like, an old McDonald’s commemorative set of Batman drinking glasses that have, like, eggnog in them— ancient nog. [Justin: Ugh, gnarly] So he takes you over to— he actually folds down, there’s like a table that he just kind of brushes some junk off of and he fold it into the wall and a sort of couch pops into place, and he offers you all a seat, and he says,
Indrid: Can I get you all anything to drink? Or eat, or—
Ned: Oh, god, no. [laughing]
Duck: Nah, no thanks.
Indrid: I haven’t entertained guests in quite some time, so I apologize that I don’t have more to offer.
Duck: Mr. Mothman—
Indrid: Please… can you call me Indrid? It’s— I don’t prefer Mothman.
Duck: … Alright, Indrid. Um, are you like super into nog? Or what’s the story?
Indrid: Who isn’t?
Griffin: He says, and he takes a belt of some [Justin: Nah, nah, nah] fresh nog from the fridge. He finishes taking a drink, and you all have gotten as comfortable as you’re gonna get in this room. And he walks over to this one wall that is opposite you— it is just next to this big map. And there are, like, eight pencil sketches of just, like, various things, it looks like he just kinda walked around Kepler and just sketched some things. Just some local buildings, and there’s one of the funicular tram that connects the top side and river side, and there’s one of the Cryptonomica, there’s just lots of sketches. And as he’s getting you all comfortable in this room, he sort of perks up and he walks over, and he takes down one of the drawings, and he crumples it up and throws it away. And he says,
Indrid: I know you all have lots of questions, and I actually know what most of those questions are going to be, but in the interest of making this feel like a normal conversation, what is it that you all want to know, before I tell you what I need?
Aubrey: … Can I have your glasses?
[someone snorts]
Indrid: No, I really—
Aubrey: Like, do you have an old pair?
Indrid: Why do you need— you need my glasses for what reason?
Aubrey: A big cat?
Duck: I thought you would know our reason. [Aubrey: Ooh.]
Indrid: I’m not a mindreader, that’s not really how this works, I have no conceivable idea why you need my glasses other than the fact that they’re very stylish.
Duck: Alright, keep your glasses, listen: I— what is going on with the— okay, let me back it up even further. Uh, it seems like snow, or wind, has been acting all… goofy? I don’t know how to put it into technical fantasy terms, but it’s been acting all shitty and weird. Um, do you know what the story is? What’s causing it?
Griffin: He, uh, he says,
Indrid: Hm.
Griffin: And he turns and he crumples up another one of those drawings, and he throws it away. And he says,
Indrid: There are a lot more… powers, that are misbehaving at the moment than just the snow or just the wind. I— okay. So I can see the future—
Duck: Cool.
Aubrey: Mhmm.
Indrid: — in a manner of speaking. And, I’ve gotten pretty good at it. There is something out there that is… changing the future. Or rather, maybe changing the present, to alter the future? This might be kind of complicated. So, I was the court seer when I was still in Sylvane— this was well over a century ago, so it’s been some time. And the power that I developed there, thanks to the powers that I inherited from Sylvane, were the powers of clairvoyancy [sic]. It’s not like seeing what’s going to happen a few minutes from now— I see several hundred futures, that could potentially come to pass. Imagine that you’re sitting in front of a big wall of televisions, hundreds of them, and there are different television shows on those screens all starting at different times. That’s what I see, potential futures. Sometimes I see patterns, I see several nearly identical futures, maybe suggesting a higher likelihood that they’ll come to pass. Sometimes I see futures disappear, when events render them impossible. But, something is making the patterns change more quickly than even I can track. Something— something unnatural.
Griffin: He says, and he crumples up another drawing and throws it away.
Indrid: I don’t know whatever it is, but I’m assuming it has something to do with the abominations, and I figured that I can help you all out. I haven’t really been in the, uh, interference game, ever since… you know, the Silver Bridge, but I figured maybe this would be a pretty good chance to do so.
Aubrey: Silver Bridge?
Duck: Yeah, it was… back quite a while— I’m telling the story as we know it, because I have to imagine that your take on it is probably a little bit, um… different from ours. But, uh, back around Point Pleasant, when a lot of people were sighting… Mr. Cold, and the Mothman quite a bit, there was a disaster— the Silver Bridge there in Point Pleasant collapsed… took a bunch of people with it.
Indrid: Forty six people.
Duck: Yeah.
Aubrey: Oh.
Indrid: Yes, it was certainly my most newsworthy failure.
Griffin: He says, and he crumples up another drawing. And he says,
Indrid: I came to this world, like I said, a little around, about a century ago, and I came here trying to find answers for the difficulties that my world’s experiencing. Instead, I found myself falling in love with your world and wanting to protect its people from harm, but it seems like people weren’t especially interested in listening to me, which I can’t blame them for. I did try to remain sort of mysterious and clandestine about my warnings, that was my undoing, but after the Silver Bridge, I walked away from the soothsaying business. It was too much, too much failure, too much, believe it or not, unpredictability. But whatever is happening now, this is not, these are not natural occurrences. This is something else entirely, and it’s something that needs to be stopped.
Griffin: And he crumples up another drawing.
Aubrey: Wait, hold on. Is this, like, a jinx thing? Like, this is, like, because we saw, y’know, the sign falling, like, that could be, oh, just an accident, and, like, the car accident with the gatorade bottle under the pedal, like, oh, it’s just an accident. But if something is changing fate? Is it, like, a jinx, curse kinda deal?
Indrid: If that were the case, that would mean that this abomination you’re facing off against is stronger than any the Pine Guard has ever faced in its illustrious career. That would be very unfortunate, indeed.
Griffin: And he crumples a few drawings off the wall now, and he closes his eyes, and he pulls the last remaining drawing off the wall. It is the drawing of the funicular train. And he looks at it, and he looks up at you, and he says,
Indrid: Okay. The funicular that connects topside and riverside is about to come crashing down the mountain, slamming into town, and destroying the base station. There are three passengers on it right now. They’ll all be killed, and an engineer at the base station will be injured as well, but he’ll pull through. Good news, though. You have six minutes this time.
Griffin: And he hands you all the drawing.
Aubrey: Go!
Indrid: Yes, go!
Aubrey: I’ll be back for those glasses!
{music 19:04 - 19:17}
Clint: Will the road get us completely there?
Travis: We’re not gonna switch to your Bobcat or whatever, Dad.
Clint: Trax ST1, Travis. 400 horsepowers of snow-cruisin’ speed, man.
Justin: Sorry, Dad just—I have to take a moment. Dad, I think, is the first person in history to ever say the plural horsepowers? Because 400 horse powers is, like, I don’t even know how far I can get. Running very fast, super beauty, flight, that’s the only three horse powers. I can’t even think of 400 altogether.
Clint: Pooping. Pooping, [crosstalk] if you’ve ever been around a horse—
Justin: [crosstalk] Pooping, super pooping.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Eatin’ lotsa oats in one sitting, is very impressive.
Travis: I thought it was supposed to be “horses power.”
Justin: Get it, oats?
Travis: Like attorneys general?
Griffin: Um, you all pull into the topside station for the funicular tram that connects Kepler’s two halves. It took you, let’s say, like, three and a half minutes to get over here, you were pretty close. And as you all approach the station—you all probably know it fairly well, like, this is, like, the main form of public transport in all of Kepler. And it sorta keeps you from having to, like, drive up the sort of winding mountain road that can get kinda treacherous, especially in the winter. And especially during sort of peak tourist season, it can get pretty busy. But as you approach, you all see the station. So, both the train and the station are fairly old. It’s been in operation for well over 30 years at this point. The station has, like, the same alpine cabin aesthetic as other buildings on topside, with just sort of a large open wall at the end of the station where the tram comes in, and a boarding platform where riders can access the arriving tram. This funicular just has a single rail and a single car. It takes about 6 minutes for a full trip between the two stations. There is a small parking lot just outside of the station where commuters can sorta leave their cars as they transfer between the two halves of Kepler. Duck, among the cars parked here, you see a Monongahela Forest Service truck.
Justin: Uh, whose is it? Do I recognize?
Griffin: Um, yeah. There is a name on the door. It is Ranger Juno Devine’s forest service truck.
Justin: Uh, so what do we do?
Travis: I—
Justin: I’m just, I’m just a tough— [laughs] I’m just a tough guy.
Travis: I’m gonna do kind of a scan first, see if the— ‘cause now that we know that possibly someb—something or someone is acting on this, I’m gonna, like, scan and look for anybody or any strange shapes or shadows or anything like that, just anything—
Griffin: Sure, you are outside of the station? Or do you wanna go inside of the station? And I’m not saying there is a wrong or right choice, there is stuff—
Travis: I’m just gonna start, I mean, we pulled up, first things first, just, like…
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Scan and look at…
Griffin: You hop out of Ned’s car and do a pass for Read a Bad Situation, I’m assuming?
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: Yes, okay. Go ahead and roll.
Travis: Ooh, nope! Snake eyes!
Griffin: Oh my god.
Justin: The worst possible read. Like, Aubrey looked around and was like, “I think this is a dream.” Like, “No, it’s all a dream! Trust me, I’ve read the situation.”
Clint: It was a two, folks.
Griffin: Uh, yeah.
Travis: It was a two, snake eyes.
Griffin: Okay, go ahead and mark experience.
Travis: Mm-hm.
Griffin: I get to take a hard move. I’m not gonna take a super hard move since that was sort of a, y’know, a preliminary look-around. Were you using your third eye?
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Now, be honest.
Griffin: Yeah, I mean, that’s, like—
Travis: I mean, I was going to, yes.
Griffin: Yeah, I figured when you said, “scan.” Um, you just get a pretty bad headache. You just get kind of a, uh, you don’t really notice anything, and you sorta kick on your third eye, and it sort of immediately kicks off, and when it does, like, you just feel this really quick sort of stabbing pain. Uh, like in your temples, but then it quickly passes.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Uh, yeah, I’m not even gonna make you mark harm. ‘Cause it just comes and it goes. Anybody else wanna do something?
Justin: I would probably, I mean, are we in shouting distance?
Griffin: Um, n—I mean, it would be, probably not, ‘cause the station’s, like, an indoor building. Um…
Clint: Time to go into the station, then.
Justin: Let’s—I think Duck is going to, and y’all can do what you like, but Duck’s probably gonna rush into the station to see who’s still in there, what the deal is.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Yeah, I think Aubrey’s going to, as well.
Griffin: Ned, you gonna do anything while you’re still outside?
Clint: Uh, no, I’ll...I’ll follow them cautiously.
Griffin: Okay. All right, you all race into the station. And as you enter, there is a desk just in front of the entryway next to a turnstile that grants access to the tram beyond. There is an engineer here, behind the desk, a broad-shouldered dude wearing a Mount Kepler Ski Trails fleece. He’s got a radio clipped to his belt. He also has a space heater back behind his desk keeping him warm, because there is a serious draft coming in through the, you know, open wall of the station. A tram has just arrived and is taking on passengers. There is what looks to be a fairly, like, bougie man and woman canoodling on two open seats inside the tram, just some unsightly PDA happening there.
Justin: Bleh.
Griffin: And there’s a third person who is just about to walk through the automated sliding doors to board the funicular, and it is Ranger Juno Devine.
Duck: Juno, stop.
Griffin: Uh, she does. She stops as she—and she’s kinda just sorta hanging out of the tram door now, she says,
Juno: Oh, hey, Duck. What are you doing here? Are you about to hit the trails?
Travis: I would say that while this is happening, Aubrey just keeps going for the tram, for the door, maybe, like, shoves past Juno into the tram itself. Like, jumps the turnstile, let’s be honest.
Griffin: Jumps—sure, okay, you’re jumping the turnstile?
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: Okay, that engineer at the desk says,
Engineer: Hey, you need to stop! Hey, you need to get pa—
Aubrey: Oh, piss off!
Ned: I’ve got—that’s all right, here, let me take care of it. I’m local businessman Ned Devine. How much is it, five, ten dollars?
Griffin: Wait, what did you say your name was?
Clint: Local businessman Ned Devine? Ned Devine?
Travis: That’s not your name.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: I know!
Griffin: I didn’t know that you and Juno were related, that’s cool.
Justin: Waking Ned Devine is a movie that came out, like, ten years ago.
[laughing]
Clint: I am…
Ned: How much is it, goddammit, how much you need? Here’s 10 bucks, is that all right?
Engineer: Well, I mean, a trail pass is 40 bucks per person for the day.
Ned: 40 bucks per—oh my—
Engineer: I mean, it’s peak season, man, what do you need?
Ned: Would you guys like to work out a co-promotion with a lovely place called the Cryptonomica? You know, they take a ride with you and then for an extra five bucks, they get admission to the Cryptonomica? I can see it tying in very nicely. Let’s talk about it, you and me, let’s talk.
Griffin: I mean, if you’re trying to convince him to, like, let you all through, that would be a Manipulate Someone roll.
Clint: Manipulate Someone, I’m going to manipulate him.
Griffin: ‘Kay.
Clint: All right, 8 plus 1 charm.
Griffin: Okay, so you have a 9. On a 7-9, they’ll do it, but only if you do something for them right now to show that you mean it. If you ask too much, they’ll tell you what, if anything, it would take for them to do it.
Clint: Ned gives him five free passes to the Cryptonomica and says,
Ned: Come and see the place, or have your bosses come and see the place. See what a great tie-in it would be, and we would like to do the same by taking a ride on your tram to kind of see, you know, if it’s worth promoting with you guys as well. See, it’s kind of a, “I scratch your back, you scratch mine.”
Engineer: Uh, Mr. Devine, I’ll make you a deal. These five passes are good—
Ned: Chicane, it’s Chicane.
Engineer: Okay. Mr. Chicane, I’ll tell you something. I’ll tell you, these five passes are nice, it sounds like your museum’s a lot of fun, but, um, I want one other thing, and that’s 40 dollars per person per day for the ski trail passes. It’s just a—it’s 120 bucks, and y’all can go about, y’know, hit the slopes and do whatever you want.
Ned: Well, you can knock some of that off with the passes to the Cryptonomica, right?
Engineer: Okay. Yeah, it’ll j—118 dollars.
Ned: All right, here. Let me write you a check. I have my checkbook right here.
Griffin: Okay, you are writing him probably what is going to be a fake check that is going to super bounce.
Clint: Yes.
Griffin: And while that is happening, we can do Duck talking to Juno. She steps back out of the car and she says, uh, and Aubrey, you said you ran into the car?
Travis: Correct.
Griffin: Okay, we’ll resolve—
Travis: To get the other two.
Griffin: We will resolve that as...we get to it. Um, Juno says,
Juno: Well, what do you need there, Duck? What’s going on?
Duck: Aw, ugh, Juno, this is so embarrassing. Um, last week...uh, my truck got beat up, and I—I had to take it over to Whistles’...and he, while he was fixin’ it up, I had to borrow yours to run out...uh, to do a check on...a...body of water...in...the...tree...zone. Forest. Fuck! It was a body of water in the tree zone?
Griffin: Okay—
Duck: And I had to check on it in your car, and when I—I drove your car without asking, and I think I left...my...pants—no. Wallet? Money. I left my wallet in your truck, and I was wondering if you could go look for it real quick.
Juno: All right, so that was all lies. Duck—
Duck: [yells]
Juno: Yeah, we’ve worked together for quite some time there, buster. I know when you’re pullin’ a fib.
Travis: Literally everyone does.
Duck: Juno, look in my eyes. Do you know when I’m pullin’ a fib?
Juno: Yes, it’s when you start stumbling over your words a whole lot and you say “fuck” a bunch.
Duck: Juno, don’t get in that car.
Griffin: Let’s jump inside the car, Aubrey, what are you doing? This couple is in here, I’m imagining sort of, um… Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the other dude from Christmas Vacation, just, uh…
Travis: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Griffin: Just ski bunnies, [Travis: The worst.] just kinda fawning over each other. And they look up at you, and I think the, uh, the woman whispers something to the man as you come in, that you can’t quite make out.
Aubrey: Hey, folks! You seem like the type that loves—
Woman: Is this a robbery?
Aubrey: No, it’s a magic show! Y’all wanna see some magic?
Travis: And she,
Aubrey: I work with the railway here to just provide a little en route entertainment.
Travis: And so she’s going to do a ma—like a trick, a magic trick.
Woman: Is this what the common folks enjoy, is magic tricks on their public transportation?
Aubrey: Indeed, they do! Allow me to demonstrate.
Travis: And she’s gonna do some of the more, you know, like, flash paper…
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Alight in her hands, but with the intention of doing it and making it seem as though she has messed up the trick, and trying to catch one of their sleeves on fire.
Griffin: Oh, boy.
Justin: Quick update from me to you, the Adventure Zone listener. Uh, these characters, whatever their names are, are now the only ones I like on the whole show, and for—the rest of TAZ is about these two characters for me, thank you very much.
Griffin: Okay, so is this a Use Magic roll, if you’re actually trying to set their, set them on fire, kind of?
Travis: But I’m using trick magic. I wanna make it super clear here, Aubrey is not trying to use real magic.
Griffin: Are you saying that because you rolled a 4?
Travis: No. I’m saying it for reasons that will become clear later.
Griffin: Okay. Um—
Travis: Um, somebody pointed out something I didn’t do last time that we could’ve totally done that I’m gonna do now, and I am going to use luck.
Griffin: Ohh, okay.
Travis: To make it a 12.
Griffin: I was gonna say—
Travis: And burn one of my luck slots.
Griffin: With a 4, I wanted you to do sort of a Gob Bluth, like, spray lighter fluid on them, like, oh, but where did the lighter fluid come from?
Travis: No, I’m using a luck slot here to save two lives.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And when the sleeve—I’m gonna grab ‘em and be like, “oh, you need to get out, oh, we need help,” and shove ‘em out the door, like, “oh, gotta get this taken care of right now, sorry, so sorry,” and shove ‘em outta the door of the tram. [crosstalk] Aubrey’s gonna—
Man: Muffy, Muffy, I’m burning, Muffy!
Travis: Now wait, which one’s Muffy, Griffin?
Griffin: Doesn’t matter, does it?
Travis: Correct.
Justin: Muffy, and what is the man’s name? Can I vote for Winthrop?
Griffin: I’s Muffy and Winthrop, yes. Uh, Justin—
Clint: Yaaay!
Griffin: —knew it.
Travis: Can he go by Winnie? Can it be Muffy and Winnie?
Griffin: Um, no, it’s Winthrop and Muffy, and Winthrop’s sleeve is on fire. He stands up, yes, understandably kind of panicked, and he doesn’t know what to do because he’s never been on fire before.
Aubrey: Oh, quick, we need some help! Oh, look, there’s two rangers, they can help you.
Travis: And shove ‘em out the door.
Griffin: Okay. Uh, yeah. That works. And go ahead and mark off that luck point. This is a very, very valuable resource that you do not get back, so I’m expecting you [Travis: Absolutely.] to really keep track of that stuff. Okay.
Travis: I am, however, Aubrey is going to stay in the car to investigate.
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t know that there’s necessarily anything to investigate right now? This is still, like, this is still a dangerous situation, so I think this would still be Read a Bad Situation. There’s not, like, clues or somebody to talk to, you know what I’m saying?
Travis: Okay, so maybe, like, steps outside the car and, like, looks up and down the track to read a bad situation? Can I see the track?
Griffin: Yes. Yeah, yeah, no, definitely, you can see the track. Um, yeah, the—
Travis: Okay, there we go.
Griffin: The mechanics of the funicular tram are that it’s just one rail with one car on it, and there’s a cable that is tethered to the front of the car that pulls it up the mountain. [Travis: Mm-hm.] It runs through a pulley, and then it connects to this counterweight that kinda slides beneath the tram, so as the tram sort of ascends, the counterweight drops down to the lower station, and as the tram descends, the counterweight rises up to sort of conserve energy, using physics. Um, and there’s, uh, there’s, yeah. That’s sort of how this all works. So you wanna read a bad situation out there?
Travis: Yeah, so the question that I want answered is, “what’s the biggest threat?”, and I’m going to say that I’m looking for, I don’t know, a frayed wire or some kind of damage to the counterweight or something along those lines.
Griffin: M’kay.
Travis: And I will also say that, along with that, she is going to attempt to use her third eye as well.
Griffin: Okay. Does the third eye count as a separate question? Or...it just…
Travis: It says when you re—you can open up your third eye for a moment to take in extra information, take plus 1 hold on any result [Griffin: Sure, okay.] plus you can see invisible things.
Griffin: All right, here’s what happens. You look up and down the track, you take a look at sort of all the mechanisms of the tram, and you don’t necessarily see anything threatening at all. And then, flakes slowly start to appear outside. And with that, your third eye, it just kinda st—it just kinda goes wild. It looks like all of these flakes are kind of glowing, as if it’s all magic. All of this stuff that is falling from the sky is definitely magical in nature. You also get, uh, you sense a presence out, back out the front door of the station that you are in. You can’t, you know, see this presence, you just kind of sense this, uh, magic power, presence outside. And then, you can see through the open wall of the station that the storm outside quickly subsides. And now you can see the threat. There is a brake pad on the pulley that the cable attached to the car runs through. And this brake pad has a bolt on it that is just kind of...corroded through, and you can hear this brake pad, like, vibrating, you can hear it squeaking. There is, the pulley is kind of moving back and forth ever so slightly as it’s vibrating, and with each kind of, like, tug that this pulley tries to make as it tries to, like, release some tension off the cable, that bolt is sliding further and further out of its housing.
Aubrey: Duck! Car’s clear, that bolt, the brakes are about to go! Out, out! There’s something—parking lot, now!
Duck: See? Do you see? That’s what I’m talking about, Juno. It’s dangerous, and you gotta take my work for it, and you gotta help me get these people out. I’ll explain later, I promise.
Travis: Aubrey’s on the move.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure.
Travis: Like, grabs, uh, grabs Muffy, grabs Winthrop.
Ned: C’mon, everybody, uh, I’ll give you a ride back into town! Come on!
Griffin: I think, as you all are heading to the door, the engineer at his desk steps over to the sort of boarding area and looks down and sees that the brakes are about to go, and he says,
Engineer: Aw, shit, I gotta warn Mark!
Griffin: And he pulls up his radio, and he says,
Engineer: Mark, come in, you gotta evacuate the base station, okay, this thing’s about to come down. [pause] Mark?
Griffin: And he slaps his radio, and there is nothing on the other end. And he looks up at the rest of you, and the brake pad just explodes.
Justin: Haha, shit.
{ad break 37:03 - 42:54}
Griffin: Okay. Two bad things are happening basically at the same time. Uh, you all were heading out the door when the brakes went off, and the car has very slowly now, just for a few moments, started to descend down the rail. The pulley is making this horrible, horrible squeaking noise, and you all also have that presence outside that you were heading out to investigate. So, who wants to go first?
Justin: Duck’s going after the presence. I feel like he’s pretty focused on that.
Griffin: Okay. You head outside, back into the parking lot outside the station, and there doesn’t appear to be anything that your non-magic eyes can just see with a quick glance.
Justin: I think he’s got good, from his job, I think he would have good situational awareness. I think it’s like, what is disturbed? Right, [Griffin: Yeah, sure.] ‘cause I’m assuming there’s forest around here, that kind of thing.
Griffin: Yeah, absolutely, right up against the trail, there’s, like, it just backs up into the woods.
Justin: He’s not, like, a game tracker or anything, but I definitely think he would recognize, y’know, a path or footprints or something if he saw it.
Griffin: That is a very good justification. I think that you, I actually don’t think you need to roll anything, I think you see these same hoofprints that you saw out near Leo’s store. And you know what hoofprints in the snow looks like because you fuckin’ see them all the time at work. [Justin: Right.] They are indeed leading back into the woods that are sort of just off to the side of the Mount Kepler Ski Trails that the station is right next to. Are you [Justin: Yeah, I’m—] going to follow them?
Justin: I’m following them.
Griffin: Okay, Aubrey, what are you doing?
Travis: So, what—uh, that question will be answered by this question: what are the NPC’s doing?
Griffin: Um, Muffy is still running around with— or, rather, Winthrop is running around with his arm still a bit on fire. I think he runs out into the parking lot and jumps into the snow, and Muffy is tending to him. Juno is just kind of in shock, because now she is just now kind of realizing that she just almost died, and that Duck, who knew that the car was about to fall, saved her life, which is weird? And the engineer is just frantically trying to get his radio to work, but it is not. They are all outside of the station, and out of harm’s way.
Clint: Could Ned drive down the hill?
Griffin: Ned absolutely could. It would be very— uh, it would be buck— a buckwild thing to do, but he could, for sure.
Aubrey: Ned, do you have a winch?
Griffin: This car is already, like, is going.
Travis: Oh, ok.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: I’m just saying that Ned would jump in the car to try to drive down the hill to warn whoever’s at the other station.
Griffin: Yes, for sure. There is no road, [Travis: Do that.] it is just sort of a snowy— there’s some— some trees that the rail cuts through, but there is no road. You can do it in the Lincoln, but I’m gonna have you— I’m going to have you roll for it.
Clint: He’s an excellent driver.
Griffin: [doubtfully] Okay! He’s driving off a cliff, so we’ll see— he’s going to put that to the fucking test, [crosstalk] yeah!
Travis: [crosstalk] Go for it, [?? 45:55]
Griffin: Uh, ok. You are heading to your car, and— Aubrey, what are you doing?
Travis: I— Aubrey steps up and thinks, like, ok, so I’m going to push the car over, right? So it’s on its side instead of on its wheels, won’t roll down or like try to push it off the track, or something so that it—
Griffin: With magic, right, not just—
Travis: With— yeah, with like a force, like a— yeah, like with a big wind, you know, like she’s used before to push Duck. And she steps up to do it, and finds herself like as she starts to think about it, and like channel, just basically her own voice in her head is like, “Don’t fuck up.” And like, it— she can’t focus, she can’t do it.
Griffin: Ok. Yeah, I think you only have a split second to do this, because, like, the train is now just out of the station, and has started to roll down the hill, and it is picking up speed, and it is well beyond the point now where you could reach it to blast it.
Travis: So she runs back in to where the dude— uh, the engineer is—
Griffin: Right.
Aubrey: Ok. Do— is there— do you have his phone number? Can you call Mark?
Engineer: I mean, there’s not a phone down there, we just use these fuckin’ radios, I—
Aubrey: Any kind of signal? A flare? A flag? Anything?
Engineer: I don’t have a flare! I don’t have a flare gun! We don’t— this doesn’t happen! I could try yellin’?
Griffin: And he just runs down to the open door— I think he just takes off, he’s now running down the rail trying to chase the train, and he’s just screaming,
Engineer: MARK! MARK! HEY, MARK!
Griffin: Uh, let’s get to Duck. Duck, you are running into the woods, and there is like ankle high snow in the ground, so you’re having a little bit of trouble as you are chasing after this thing. And you can’t— you haven’t seen it yet, you’ve just been following the tracks in the ground. And you move through some brush, and you start to see this hooded figure like 30 feet in front of you. And he doesn’t appear to be having any trouble moving through the snow at all, and you’re having a little trouble just sort of keeping pace with him. And then he disappears through like another layer of brush, and as you punch through that, you see this figure waiting for you. Its got its hood up, it is still towering over you, and he’s holding in his hand just an axe, like a wood chopping axe, and you actually recognise that there is a— like a sticker, like a label on the handle, and this axe belongs to the Monongahela National Forest Service. And he is waiting for you, axe in hand, as you come through the brush, and end up about ten feet away from him in a clearing. What do you do?
Duck: Hey, what the fuck?
Griffin: It starts taking a step towards you.
Justin: Is there any handy sticks?
[muffled laughter]
Griffin: Do you not have your sword on you?
Justin: Yeah, I do have my sword. [laughing] I do have my sword on me, it just felt like cheating. I pull out Beacon.
Beacon: Duck Newton, you seem outmatched. Once again, you turn to me, Beacon, to help even the odds, ah?
Duck: [to Beacon] Hey, li— just pipe down for just a second. [to the creature] Hey, I don’t want to hurt you. Maybe I do, because I don’t actually know what or who you are, so there’s a decent chance I want to hurt you, and I know this dude does. But like, what the fuck?
Griffin: It starts to slow down for a second as if it is kind of like second guessing whether or not you’re worth it, and I think it actually even turns back away from you for a second, and then it re-thinks it and it turns back to face you and starts walking towards you, now kind of a little bit faster as it starts to rear up the axe.
Duck: Ah, shit. Um, all right then, fine! This is out of my nature, though, I do want that to be clear, because we don’t know each other so well.
Justin: But I guess I’m going to Kick Its Ass?
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I’m probably going to swing, though, like at the arm with the axe, like— yeah, like—
Griffin: Oh, I see. Okay.
Justin: Yeah, I’m not trying to like kill. I’m not— you know, I’m trying to dis— to diffuse the situation as best I can, but I also know I’m dealing with like some otherworldly shit.
Griffin: Yeah, so why don’t you roll to Kick Some Ass, and we’ll see how well you do at this.
Justin: That is an eight, plus two! Ten.
Griffin: Awesome! So you all will inflict harm on each other. On a ten plus, you can gain the advantage; take plus one forward, or give plus one forward to another hunter; you inflict terrible harm; you suffer less harm; or you force them where you want them.
Justin: I’m gonna force them where I want them.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Which would be on the ground.
Griffin: Okay. What does this look like? Okay, so the robed figure—
Justin: The robed figure, I think, probably comes in for a swing— is that fair? You didn’t say that, but I feel like that’s what we’re moving towards, right?
Griffin: Yeah, for sure.
Justin: In this moment. So in that moment, I think Duck sort of swings up and hits the axe hard with Beacon, and whatever this thing is, I think it makes sense to me at least that it’s not ready for that. That— whether it is physically stunned, or just like, ‘Whoa, what the fuck is that? What the fuck is going on here? This is unexpected.’ It’s sort of like knocked off kilter, and Duck just sort of buries his shoulder into the du— thing’s chest, whatever the thing is, and knocks it to the ground.
Griffin: Okay. So you didn’t actually attack with the sword?
Justin: No, I did, I used the sword to hit the axe, and it’s like—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Justin: [crosstalk] Not— no, yeah, I wasn’t like scaring it. No, I— literally like hit the axe, and I think sort of knocked it off balance, and then fully knocked it off balance.
Griffin: Okay. So I guess the two harm is just from you shoulder— shouldering it very hard?
Justin: It fell on a rock.
Griffin: It fell on a rock, and it hurt its butt. I think as the axe swung away from you, as you disarm it, as you knock this thing to the ground, its free hand, the one that was not holding the axe, kind of swung around very quickly as you knocked it down, and just kind of pounded you in the chest for two harm, but you don’t take any of that. And you knock it to the ground.
Justin: Great.
Griffin: Let’s jump to Ned.
Ned: Aubrey! Grab the radio and come on!
Clint: And Ned jumped behind the steering wheel of the Lincoln and fires it up. He happens to remember that Mark is one of the best customers the Cryptonomica has—
Griffin: [laughs slightly] Okay.
Clint: —and he wants to warn the guy that something bad is coming, so he’s going to try to drive down the hill using his amazing driving skills—
Griffin: Sure.
Clint: And his brand new chains, I wanted to point that out— brand new chains. Said it all along, brand new chains on the Lincoln.
Griffin: Okay, you did, that’s right. God, you remember everything this game!
Clint: It had to happen once.
Griffin: Yeah, sure. You yelled for Aubrey. Aubrey, are you going with?
Travis: Umm, yeah. Let’s do it. [Griffin: Okay.] I run and do kind of a cool Starsky and Hutch thing.
Clint: Cool.
Ned: Buckle in, please.
Aubrey: Go!
Clint: I slam the 8-track— I slam the soundtrack to Live and Let Die into the 8-track and go plunging out of the parking lot, and go driving down the hill, fishtailing back and forth, and trying to dodge trees and, uh, and all kinds of— you know like plunging through snow drifts, trying to keep pace and trying to pass the train.
Griffin: Okay. Go ahead and Act Under Pressure for me.
Clint: Eight, plus one for Cool, that’s a nine.
Travis: Could Aubrey help?
Griffin: If you tell—
Clint: Pointing out trees?
Travis: Like, yeah—
Aubrey: Look out!
Travis: And like jerking— jerking the wheel or something, you know?
Griffin: Yeah, sure, go ahead and roll to help out.
Travis: I have rolled [crosstalk] so bad.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh my god, Trav!
Travis: It’s a five. That don’t help.
Griffin: No, and in fact— yeah, you don’t do anything, you are exposed to the trouble or danger of the roll, and— yeah, okay, so no help there. You have a mixed success here. So— I’m going to get to the price of this mixed success, but for right now, you go off the paved parking lot, and just over the cliff, and I think everybody sees you like, “Oh shit, what? How— oh, God! Why? Huh?” As your Lincoln goes over the hill, and sure enough, you are driving down this very, very steep sort of hillside alongside the rail, and dodging trees and rocks and debris as you go as Aubrey sort of points it out, and you manage to get alongside the train car. Here’s the choice I’m going to give you: you can get past this train and you can get down to that base station before the train does, but you are going to come in very very very hot. You are going to come in, you know, faster than a speeding train, and you have no real guarantees that you are going to be able to stop safely.
Clint: Or would I have time to pull in front of it?
Griffin: Yes, I mean, you could do either thing, but again, the choice I’m giving you here is, like, you’re gonna— the Lincoln is going to get— it’s not going to, uh—
Travis: Survive.
Griffin: No, the Lincoln’ll survive, we’ll— we’ll roll to determine that, but it will take a hit. You’re going to put your car in danger, basically, to fix this situation, because I think getting down the hill before the train safely is now impossible. So you can either drive down and crash into the station, which will probably get the people out of it, or you can try to intercept the train car. So which option are you going with here, Mac?
Clint: I’m going to go with the collide, and [Griffin: Good.] and try to— try to slow it down or stop it. I was thinking that if he can accelerate enough, and jump the Lincoln in front of the train, and then hit the brakes and the emergency brake and everything else, that it might at least slow the train down so it won’t crash into the station as badly.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, I think that’s going to definitely be another Act Under Pressure roll, and this one is going to be, I will say, a lot more high stakes than the last one is, because that’s kind of the position that you now find yourself in.
Clint: Okay. So he hits the gas, he floors it, it goes shooting up, and then he hits the steering wheel to the left and it jumps over the tracks, those chains just dig right in, and he hits the brakes, hits the emergency brake— I rolled a ten.
Griffin: Cool!
Clint: Plus one for Cool, which is eleven.
Griffin: Yeah, you do what you set out to.
Travis: Sick.
Griffin: You get the Lincoln in front of this tram— again, it’s just like a single small single car tram, and it was going very very fast, but you manage to just barely get ahead of it, and as you slam on your brake, you can see it start to slow down and you feel actually some metal in the back of your car crumpling, but it's not going to give way entirely because it’s a Lincoln, it’s a very sturdy beast. And—
Travis: A sturdy American automobile!
Griffin: And you still have some time before you reach the station. However, there is one problem, and that is the counterweight that is now coming up towards you from the bottom of the track from the base station, that is fairly sizeable and is moving at you fairly quickly. The tram is designed to sort of harmlessly go over it, but your car is not— your car does not have the height that the tram has, so that is going to be a situation, unless you can figure out some way out of it.
Travis: How fast are we moving?
Griffin: I would say you’ve got it down to about 40 miles an hour.
Aubrey: Hey, Ned?
Ned: Hmm?
Aubrey: We should jump.
Ned: Oh...I just got it waxed! I just— [groaning] Oh… All right, let’s jump!
Griffin: Okay. I mean I’m not going to make you roll for this, because this is a sacrifice that is considerable—
Clint: Isn’t there a lot of snow?
Griffin: Uh, yeah, sure— no, I’m not talking about your life being sacrificed.
Clint: [dejectedly] I know.
Ned: I love that car.
Aubrey: We’ll get you a new car, Ned.
Griffin: Okay. You all jump out the side, and—
Clint: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I pull the Live and Let Die 8-track out of the 8-track player, because that is irreplaceable.
Griffin: Okay. And with that, you tuck and roll out of the vehicle, and are harmlessly caught by a thick pad of snow, and you roll to a stop and seconds after you do so, you see the counterweight smash into the Lincoln, and the Lincoln now sort of gets tied up between the counterweight and the tram [Clint moaning sadly] and I think with that, the tram also now skips the tracks and now is kind of tumbling down the hill, and now all of it— the counterweight and the tram and your car kind of tied up in this cable, are very very slowly, slowly skidding to a halt just in front of the base station
Ned: [sobbing] Oh, poor Ruby!
Aubrey: I’m proud of you, Ned.
Ned: [sobbing] And the 8-track got smashed! Oh, god! I’ll have to steal another one from McCartney!
Griffin: Let’s get back to Duck. You have knocked this thing down to the ground, and disarmed it. And as you’ve done so, as it kind of rolled on the ground, you see that it's hood has come off of its head. And what you see there poking out of this brown robe, you see a goat’s head. It looks a lot like Vincent, actually. It looks like it could be Vincent’s very very jacked brother. But there is a goat man laying on the ground in front of you. What do you do?
Duck: Vincent?
Griffin: It looks up at you, and it just has these wild eyes and these kind of scared eyes, and it starts bleating at you very very loudly. And it doesn’t seem to recognise you, I don’t know if that’s what you were going for? It is just kind of shouting at you as you’re on top of it.
Justin: Duck has like, realised that he does not have the Greco-Roman training that maintaining the situation is going to require. So I want you to imagine clumsily while holding the goat man’s arm— axe arm down with his left hand— or, sorry with his left foot, he reaches over with his right hand and like punches the goat’s wrist to try to get it to let go of the axe. It is very ungraceful, and probably ineffective.
Griffin: No, yeah, you’ve definitely— definitely disarmed it at this point. And I think he is wrestling to get you off of him, are you trying to maintain this position?
Justin: Yes, I’m trying to maintain the grip so I can— I mean, he’s just bleating at me, remind me— I’m having some trouble remembering, is there any reason why someone from Sylvain wouldn’t necessarily be able to understand me? Like, they can speak our language, right?
Griffin: Yeah!
Justin: I mean, we speak the same language, I guess is what I’m saying?
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. There is no reason why this goat man would not be able to understand you if he’s from Sylvain. [Justin: Okay.] But it’s— this goat man starts just shouting more and more and more and it’s just echoing through the trees. And then it is answered, by another loud bleat nearby in the brush, and then a second, also close by.
Duck: Aw, ffffffff— shit.
Travis: Fuck.
Griffin: And then two more robed goat men step out of the brush flanking their companion. One of them is wielding a shovel and the other one is wielding a large pair of shears. And they see you on top of their goat brother and start charging in your direction.
Justin: By the time they have— I have first seen them and realised what was developing, as soon as they get within eye shot of me, they noticed that maybe even without me sort of necessarily doing it, Beacon has now coiled its way around the goat’s throat.
[Amnesty theme begins to play]
Griffin: The two goat men stop and they look at each other, and you can’t tell if they’re scared or confused as they turn to you with silent attention.
Duck: Hold up, hold up. Y’all don’t know me— listen, I would not just kill your friend lying here unarmed on the ground like this.
Beacon: But I most definitely would.

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Griffin: You hear music coming from Minerva. It’s— it’s like a sad and beautiful, like, acoustic blues tune.
You see a black imperial crown coupe wrapped around a tree. In the driver’s seat is your accomplice—
Clint: And I pack— fill my pockets and then I gotta run into the woods!
Griffin: I think you are surprised when you cut clean through the pole.
Aubrey: Whoops!
Griffin: And it falls over into the store. The counterweight and the tram and— and your car kind of tied up in this cable are very very slowly, slowly skidding to a halt.
Justin: Beacon has now coiled its way around the goat’s throat.
Duck: Y’all don’t know me. Listen, I— I would not just kill your friend lying here unarmed on the ground like this.
Beacon: But I most definitely would.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Griffin: Maybe we should start with like a refresher, ‘cause it’s been— it’s been a Gregorian Calendar year since we’ve played this game. In this one, you hunt big monsters. Or sometimes—
Clint: Ooh, scary!
Griffin: Yeah, sometimes— it is a little scary, I’m going to go ahead and give this one a PG-13.
Travis: Griffin, have we revealed yet that we’re the real monsters? Like—
Griffin: Yeah, I think if you’ve been paying attention to like the subtext of the podcast, we have— the Walking Dead is actually maybe even us? If you can believe it?
Travis: [Comprehending] Ahh!
Clint: Nice! Well I don’t need it because I’ve taken copious notes, but I’m sure that the other two—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay, why don’t you—
Clint: [crosstalk] The other two might need it.
Griffin: Yeah. Why don’t you lead us, then, Dad, in prayer?
Clint: Uhh, dear Lord, please bless us with recognition, with cognitive abilities to remember all of the many wonderful things that have happened, and thank you for the blessings of podcasting—
Justin: [crosstalk] All right, he doesn’t— he’s just making— he doesn’t know shit.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay, he has no idea, yeah.
Justin: Just pulling that out of his old ass.
Clint: Amen.
Griffin: So basically, things have been happening that are bad. Bad things have happened that are bad. Like accidents. You had Danimal’s wreck because of the Gatorade bottle, you had the Pizza Hut sign falling into the building, and now you had the funicular tram— something went wrong with its brake mechanism, and it fell and was only prevented from wrecking the base station and the people inside of it because of Ned and Aubrey and the brave sacrifice of the Lincoln Continental. So that has sort of been the main threat. There— it’s kind of followed a pattern, where there’s been a sudden storm, and as it passes, that is when things start to go wrong.
You have also seen now these hooded figures that now you know to be these goat men that kind of resemble some of the creatures, including Vincent, that you have seen over in Sylvain. And Duck, you were in the middle of sort of stand-off where you had one of them taken captive with Beacon wrapped around its throat, with two more sort of facing you down. What other sort of stuff has been— Aubrey has kind of had some issues with her magic and her not really understanding how to make it work reliably, I guess?
Travis: I would say that she has some reluctance to safety and danger, you know? And concerns.
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: I think it’s great that Travis’s rolls in The Adventure Zone have been such that, should he actually roll unfavourably, he has to create a narrative reason why this is happening. Certainly this is not within the bounds of reality, certainly there’s a narrative reason why my rolls are bad!
Travis: Justin, the dice tell the story, you know, I’m just—
Justin: [Repeats somewhat incredulously] The dice are telling the story.
Travis: I am a humble messenger, the dice truly pin the tail on the donkey.
[Justin laughing]
Griffin: Let’s do— is there any other— we also had Ned’s sort of realizing that it was Aubrey’s house that he robbed, and that was sort of— that was sort of a fateful event in this campaign. It was the last robbery that he and his partner had before they had their wreck that left the partner behind, and Duck, you had, let’s see… a vision, a pretty bad vision of a meteor falling planetside [Justin: Yeah.] back in the first episode. Anything else that we need— you’ve met the Mothman, that was cool.
Travis: Duck has a sister.
Griffin: Duck has a sister, he also saved Juno from the funicular falling. Oh, these goat men have the tools from Danimal’s car, the one that wrecked, so they took what seemed like his arborist tools from the vehicle after it crashed. I think that’s it, I think we might be belaboring now. You all ready to hop back in, now that we’ve done sort of some groundwork?
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Okay.
Griffin: I mean let’s pick things up with— with Duck. That’s sort of the most pressing thing that I’m curious how it is going to resolve. You have this one goat man held captive, you have the sword to its throat — or rather, I guess, around its throat, which is sort of a unique way to put a sword to something’s throat — and you have these two goat men that you are facing off against, one with these long shears and one with a big shovel. And as you and Beacon say this badass shit, the two goat men facing you down don’t really, they really take a beat here. They don’t know how to respond. They don’t look scared, so much as they look, they look confused. They look like the possibility of one of them being in danger actually never even occurred to them. And I think they have a beat here where they are just kind of stopped still in their tracks, and just sort of stare at you waiting for your next move. What do you do?
Justin: I’m gonna try and talk to them—
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And it sounds a little something— that’s a weird intro. I should always do that before I start talking. [crosstalk] And now my character speaks. [laughter]
Griffin: [crosstalk] And now I speak.
[Clint and Griffin laughing]
Duck: [More gravelly than usual] Listen, y’all, I’m gonna be honest with you. He’s got a mind of his own. And I’m not playing “good cop, bad cop,” you better start talking so I can call this whole thing off, because he will decapitate your friend.
Beacon: [Also more gravelly than usual] Duck Newton tells the truth. Nothing would please me more. Please, discussss...
Travis: This is great, because Justin’s been recording the shit out of the Sawbones audiobook, and so Duck Newton’s voice has changed, it’s become a lot deeper.
Justin: Yeah, he’s down— it’s down here, because this is all I have left.
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Griffin: Yeah, the people on the tour we’re about to go on are just gonna get sort of tatters. Tatters of Justin’s soul.
Justin: You know when I get, I got one of those Hollywood doctors to give me the shots of the good stuff. [Clint and Justin laughing] Keep the glitter and glamor from spilling out my pores for the ticket buyers, of course.
Griffin: These two goat men that you’re facing off with, they look at each other, and the one holding the shovel kind of blinks, and then says:
Shovel Goat Man: *bleating noises*
And you immediately realize that they do not speak your common human tongue. They really have no way of speaking to you, you don’t even know if they understood what you just said. They obviously understood that their compatriot here is in danger, but that’s about the long and short of it. I guess my question for you is like, what are you hoping to accomplish with this hostage situation?
Justin: So here is the questions for me as a player. One, I’m obviously outnumbered and in a great deal of danger: can I secure my safety? Second, I don’t necess— I assume because of the structure of the show, that these people have— no, these goats [laugh] have bad intent, but I, it feels, Duck in the world does not know that. So, that is, I’m trying to ascertain, I think that. Is this a situation where these are hostile, or, you know or, what is the deal? Those are the two things I’m trying to achieve.
Griffin: Follow-up question— this goat man that you have held hostage, is you know, has human characteristics and also animal characteristics. Does Duck feel an actual sort of reluctance to commit violence to this thing? Obviously, the big, you know, omni-bear that you guys fought in the woods, and the water ghost that you fought, you didn’t necessarily have that element of, you know, personification, I guess, for lack of a better term.
Justin: Yeah, well, and I think also this is a situation where he has managed to get the upper hand? [Griffin: Okay.] And Duck is not the sort of dude who’s just gonna like… decapitate an unarmed creature [Griffin laughs] that he has pounced upon with nary a word spoken, one way or the other. I mean, he is— like, even if it was just an animal and not a personified animal, like… it didn’t attack him, yet. It may be responsible for some bad stuff but he’s not gonna, like, decapitate the thing [Griffin: Sure. Okay.] just because he has the opportunity to. He may come to regret that, but that is where he is coming from.
Griffin: Let’s do this, then. I think this is probably going to be a Manipulate Someone. I think that’s how we codify this and it’s how we move the plot forward? You want them to do something, you have something that— you have leverage, which is this captive. So, I think just to firm this up and to move forward, you tell them what you want them to do, and you roll plus charm, and you give them a reason. And I think your reason here is just, “Or I’ll kill your friend.” Or not friend, but, you know [crosstalk] fellow goat man.
Justin: [crosstalk] And I am definitely using some, like, hand motions to try to indicate, basically, weapons down. [Griffin: Okay.] Like, calm— you know what I mean? Like calming, like I would probably with an animal [stammering] you know, as effective as that is, I have no idea. Uh, roll 2d6— [goofy voice] Uh— Oh no! [Travis laughs] It’s a four! It’s a four, innit? Oh no.
Griffin: Aw, buddy. Aw, pal.
Justin: Oh no.
Travis: Oh no.
Justin: Bad.
Griffin: Okay, I’m gonna take a hard move here. They… I think they get one over on you. The one with the shovel sort of just starts taking a step back, it’s holding on to its shovel— it actually grips a little bit tighter to its shovel, because it doesn’t want to lose this tool. The one with the shears starts to put it down, and then— I think its legs just sort of compress and then spring forward at you, just so— just so blindingly fast, and closes the gap between the two of you. And I think before you or Beacon have the chance to react, the shears go through the goatman that you are holding hostage— right through its shoulder, and into your shoulder.
Justin: Aw man, that’s my shoulder!
Travis: Oh, no!
Griffin: You take three harm as this shear goes into you. And it pulls it back, and the goatman that you are holding captive falls to the ground and is bleating— and bleeding, hey! Alright.
[Exclamations of delight]
Griffin: — Just bleating up a storm. And at this moment, you are looking at this goatman that you’re holding hostage— or you were, just moments ago, I think at this point Beacon is now off this thing, and the two of you are just kind of on the ground— and, the other two goatmen have been kind of emotionless, kind of, um, robotic, although they are not robots. Almost like, confused by this hostage situation, and the emotions that you are trying to conjure up. The one on the ground is fucking— it’s terrified. It is terrified, and it is exhibiting a lot more emotion than the other two ever did. And the one with the shears gets ready to leverage another strike down at you, and then both of the standing goatmen, their ears perk up and you see them look, into the trees behind you, and you hear a car pulling up. And as it pulls up, these two remaining goat men run away. And you hear snow crunching, and through the brush comes Barclay. He’s holding his car keys, he has a baseball bat in hand, and he surveys the situation, and he says,
Barclay: Uh, okay, so it’s goat men this time?
Duck: Yeah, apparently it’s, uh, goat men.
Griffin: He helps you up to your feet, and
Duck: [Groans in pain]
Griffin: Yeah, he has a jacket on that he takes off and presses to the wound in your shoulder. Obviously, it’s not as bad as it would have been for a normal person, because you absorbed two of the harm with your chosen armor. But he says,
Barclay: Alright, let’s get back to the lodge. Did something happen? Did I miss something? Was there another sort of big accident?
Duck: Yeah, the… what do you call it, gondola? Sky gondola? Had a crash.
Barclay: Yeah we need to get you back to the lodge and sew up that shoulder. Wh—
Duck: I’ll be okay. Listen, can you get in there and check on everybody? I’ll be alright, I’ll wait in the car.
Barclay: I mean I will, but I think we have a bit more of a pressing issue.
Griffin: And he looks down at the ground where there is still the injured goat man just kind of writhing. His bleating is getting a little bit quieter, it seems like his consciousness is starting to wane, and he says,
Barclay: I don’t really know what to do in this situation.
Duck: You don’t speak goat?
Barclay: [Snorting] No I don’t fucking speak goat, why would I speak goat?
Duck: That was racist, wasn’t it? [crosstalk] Shit, I’m sorry.
Barclay: [crosstalk] A little bit, kinda.
Duck: Yeah, I just assumed, he seemed like a Sylvane kinda—
Griffin: Barclay says,
Barclay: Yeah, he does kinda look like a Sylvane thing, but he’s— he’s definitely not.
Duck: Wait, w-wait, seriously?
Barclay: I mean, he would be able to speak if he— I don’t know what this thing is, Duck.
Griffin: And the goat man on the ground is now looking up at the two of you and its breathing is slowing. You actually see, like, tears in its eyes. This being is looking up at you as the two of you are speaking. I think it’s stopped sort of crying out at this point and is just kind of quietly looking up at you.
Duck: Alright, listen, [sigh], we gotta get this thing back to the lodge, or this, person—
Barclay: [crosstalk] [stammering]
Duck: I know, I know, I know, but look at it, man. It’s gonna die if we don’t do something. Hell, we got veterinary equipment down there, we could— somebody will be able to at least take a look, see if we could do something. Can’t just let the poor thing die. For all I know, there’s three of them on Earth. That’s not how I do it.
Griffin: He kinda laughs nervously and he goes,
Barclay: We can’t tell Mama about this, okay?
Duck: Yeah, man, it wasn’t high on my list, bud. I just wanna help the thing if we can. It’s kinda my fault, mainly Beacon’s.
Beacon: Duck Newton, I will persist when you are dust. Do not take a moment to question m— [muffled, unintelligible speaking]
Justin: And I rolled him back up.
[Clint, Griffin and Justin chuckle]
Griffin: Okay, Barclay helps you pick this goat man up. I think, as you get it off the ground, it sort of bleats in protest for a bit. I think its shoulder hurts quite a bit as you lift it up, and the two of you manage to get it— it’s actually a truck that he is driving, it’s Mama’s truck, and Barclay helps you put him in the truck bed and then kinda looks around and realizes, “Oh shit, we don’t want anybody to see this,” and has a tarp back there that he covers the goatman up with, and the three of you head back to the lodge.
Let’s also resolve Aubrey and Ned, you all have just jumped out of a moving vehicle. Ned, you have just seen your automobile be destroyed as it sort of gets tangled up in the cable and counterweight and car. I think all of those things just kind of turned into a big, big ball and stopped just before running into the base station, and you all also came to a stop about 30 feet from the base station. You’re pretty close now, and you can actually see the engineer in there, Mark, I think, is what we named him last time. He is listening to some music on some headphones, and he has his back to this obviously wild, chaotic scene and just has no idea what happened behind him. What do you do?
Clint: We weren’t injured when we jumped out, were we?
Griffin: No, I think that the way we justified it is the sacrifice was the car, and I wasn’t gonna make you all, y’know, break all the bones in your body. You landed in—there was some thick snow here, so you landed in that and were pretty much okay.
Travis: But at this point, like… is the situation done?
Griffin: Yeah. Situation’s done. There is no more threat posed to the base station.
Ned: So the car’s not… salvageable…? Would you say it’s totaled?
Aubrey: Yeah, Ned, I’m gonna say it’s totaled. I hope you have insurance.
Ned: [Sharply inhales] …Yeah!
Aubrey: Oh Ned, oh no.
Ned: Okay, I’ll tell you what. Let me get a few things out of the trunk, and then I guess we have to trudge back up the hill?
Aubrey: I mean, I can call a Lyft. No, wait, there’s no cell service! Fuck!
[Griffin laughs]
Griffin: Got ya again!
Clint: Alright, so Ned goes and gets the Wookie costume out of the trunk. It’s… it’s unharmed.
Griffin: Sure, I love the sort of… unofficial bag of holding that Ned always has on him, where he just always has either one of the objects that we established that Ned had in character creation, or from Heathcliff, or just that you fuckingstole from some celebrity at some point. So I imagine [crosstalk]—
Clint: [crosstalk] My trunk of holding.
Griffin: Your trunk of holding, I imagine that there’s quite a few things. As you’re rooting around in the trunk, which, by the way, is pretty hard to get to, because it’s not much of a trunk anymore as much as it is, like, a can of Dr. Pepper that, y’know, a horse stepped on. [sarcastic] God, that’s a fuckingbeautiful metaphor, Jesus Christ I’m good at this. Holy shit. You guys are so fuckinglucky that you get to play this fucking game with me. [crosstalk, mumbling]
Clint: [crosstalk] You’re like a wordsmith!
Justin: [crosstalk, sarcastic] What a talent. The voice of a fuckinggeneration.
Griffin: Damn. As you’re rooting through, the engineer is alerted to the police sirens that are actually going off as these two sheriff station vehicles pull up in front of the base station, and you see two figures run inside. You see Sheriff Zeke and Deputy Dewey sprint into the station and start checking the area. And I think that they see you, and Zeke looks kinda surprised to see you, especially Ned—he notices you, Aubrey, but when he sees Ned, he’s like:
Sheriff Zeke: Aw, fuck.
Griffin: Uh, and, the engineer walks over to the train-car-cable-counterweight situation, uh, and starts looking around, and says, he says:
Mark: Hey, uh, are you two okay? You weren’t in the train, were you?
Ned: No, no no no. Oh ho, gosh no. We, uh, avoided that. It was a close call, but ah, no, not on the train, not on the train. We were, we were in the car, ummm, uh… it’s terrible, terrible tragedy. Awful. It’s a one-of-a-kind, a collector’s item. If you know anybody who buys scrap metal, I uh, I’m, I’m, they could give me a call.
Griffin: Just, he’s, I think as you are speaking about, uh for some reason, in the moment of him discovering that the train has been destroyed, asking him about secondhand scrap metal retailers, he is now focused entirely on the train, and he says:
Mark: Oh shit.
Griffin: And he runs back to the base station, and you see him pick up his radio, and try to contact the engineer back at the top, um, but then he puts the radio down and kinda looks at it and slaps it against his palm, and his— his radio has stopped working, uh and then he shakes it a little bit, and you see some brown liquid come out of it, and you see him kinda realise that the, uh, coffee that he was drinking earlier spilled onto the radio, uh which, which kept it from working. And he just starts, I think, walking up the hill just to make sure everybody at the top station is okay. And with that, Sheriff Zeke walks over to the two of you and says:
Sheriff Zeke: All right so, so, it seems like it’s starting to become a bit of a, uh... habit with y’all, being right in the middle of the mess of things, lately, huh?
Ned: Total accident, Sheriff. I, uh, was trying to uh, drive down the hill, to warn Mark, because we saw the funiculee-funiculah out of control, and so I was trying to drive down the, uh… new chains [laughs]. So I just thought, yeah we’ll just drive down, warn Mark, he’ll be okay. And... just, uh, the car, weren’t as good of chains as I thought, and uh, just drifted right into the path of the train. Terrible, terrible accident. Thank god no one was hurt, in— in this.
Griffin: Sheriff Zeke looks over at you, Aubrey, and sees you being kinda quiet, he says, uh:
Sheriff Zeke: Are you— are you okay, miss?
Aubrey: Uh yeah, like— like you said, you know, just, right place, right time? Wrong place, wrong time…
Sheriff Zeke: It can’t be both, at— at once.
Aubrey: Well, we did kinda save Mark, but also kind of wreck the car, so, you know. [Clint gives a long sigh] I would call it a win, but… Anywho, we should get going, uh…
Ned: Yes, we’ve got a thing…
Aubrey: Oh, right, yeah that thing, yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Ned: That thing, Aubrey.
Sheriff Zeke: Y’all this— this funicular’s been serving this town for a few decades now, and there’s been an accident, and— and I still don’t know what’s going on at the top station, I don’t know if anybody else has been hurt, and as far as I can see, Ned, your car crashed into a train, and all of it got wrecked, so, I— I… [half-laughs]
[Ned and Aubrey protest]
Aubrey: Well, hold on. Talk to the, the guy at the top of the hill, and he’ll tell you the cable broke long before our car got in the way. We saved Mark— we saved the station! You’re welcome!
Ned: We’re sorta heroes.
Griffin: He looks a bit caught off guard, he says:
Sheriff Zeke: That don’t change the fact that now two days in a row something’s gone wrong in Kepler, and y’all have been at the scene, and—
Aubrey: Yeah, but you’re here too, so, maybe...
Ned: Hmmmm!
Sheriff Zeke: I’m the fucking Sheriff! This is how it works, I’m always there when bad things happen!
[Justin chuckling]
Aubrey: A likely story!
Sheriff Zeke: Listen, I’m not— I’m not, y’all aren’t under arrest or anything, but—
Aubrey: Okay, bye!
Sheriff Zeke: Uh, but, Ned, would you mind just coming down the Sheriff station with me, just— just answer some questions. There’s— I need to know something, okay?
Aubrey: Okay, Ned, seems like you got this?
Ned: Whoa, whoa!
Aubrey: So… [Ned: Uhh] I have to, uh, go… I’ve got that thing, like we said.
Ned: The thing, the thing, yeah. Yeah. I’ll— I’ll go with the sheriff, and, uh, Aubrey, you go do the thing, and make sure that the thing is... okay, with the thing?
Aubrey: Sounds great.
Griffin: Do either of you know what he’s talking about?
Travis: No.
Clint: I don’t even know what I’m talking about.
Griffin: Fantastic.
[Music]
Griffin: Duck, you and Barclay have managed to get this goat man back to the uhhh, base… uh, the base?
Justin: The base? That sounds very militaristic, I love it.
Griffin: Back to Amnesty Lodge, back to the Pine Guard headquarters, underneath in the cellar. Uh, Barclay hops out of the truck as you all get there, and sorta gives you like a “hold on” signal, and then runs inside, and comes out, and says:
Barclay: All right, Mama’s not here, I think she’s out running errands or something, but uh, uh, we’re in the clear.
Griffin: And he helps you get the goat man inside. Uh, and up on the— I don’t actually know what your sort of veterinary-infirmary situation looks like, can you sort of— can you describe, like is this something that Duck knows how to do? Or what— what, what are you sort of envisioning this scene looking like?
Justin: Duck is probably— probably first aid, I would think, as far as like, what he can do. That seems to me to be logical, like he’s not a… serious, you know— he’s not an animal physician, but I think he probably is aware of, um, you know the basics. So what we’re talking about in this area, I think you can imagine a... metal table, in the middle of the room, and then some like, uhhhh, like formica counters sorta surrounding it with wood cabinets above, sort of cheap wood cabinets, that are filled with all manner of, you know, tinctures and medications— tinctures sounds fake. [Laughs] Medications—
Griffin: [Laughing] Salves—
Justin: Salves, and po—
Travis: Yeah, some ointments, linens—
Clint: Unguents? [crosstalk] Some unguents?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Potions, uhh…
Justin: I’m uniquely positioned to keep continuing to crank out synonyms here, after recording the Sawbones audiobook [Clint laughs], so we probably want to stop this game right here. But that is— there is also a scale in the corner of the room. And that is sort of what, uh, we’re looking at here.
Griffin: Okay. Um, so, first off, as you all come in, Thacker, who you’ve seen down here in sort of the little kitchen-dungeon area that Mama set up, every time you all have been down here, Thacker has just sort of been comatose, just sort of lost in whatever state that he is in, seated criss-cross-applesauce, just kind of in the middle of the kitchen there. And as you all come in, and this goat man is starting to shout a little bit more, not— not super loudly, not shout, but sort of starting to make some animalistic noises, Thacker actually looks up, and comes up to his knees, and is just sort of surveying this scene quietly.
You get the goat man laid out the table, and you’ve definitely seen like some cuts and bruises on the trails, and from people sort of hiking Appalachian trail and sort of, getting some grisly wounds along the way. You know that miraculously— or perhaps not miraculously, you don’t really know what the physiology of this thing is— they, they don’t seem to have hit an artery or anything like that.
This thing is obviously very, very injured, with a wound that goes, you know, clean through, but there’s not like a ton of blood. So you get the impression that, you know, maybe you can just seal this thing up and, you know, give it some antibiotics, or something? I don’t wanna sort of tell you how this scene works, but you get the idea that like, you, this is maybe a little bit above your paygrade but you could take a shot at it. Treating this thing. And you have Barclay also helping you out. I think Barclay is actually helping hold this thing down, because every time you get close to this wound, it gets super scared again, it gets very, very scared.
Duck: Okay. So, there’s a wound right here, uhhh, I, what do you think, clean it? Definitely wanna clean it with alcohol first. I remember that, yes. Alcohol, clean with alcohol first.
Justin: So I go and get the bottle of alcohol from the shelf—
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I get a clean rag, and I— you don’t really think of clean rags, do you? [Griffin and Justin laugh] Hand towel, dump some alcohol on it, and I say, uh,
Duck: Sorry?
Justin: And then I pour alcohol on to the wound.
Griffin: I’m tryna think of the best way to do this. I want to you maybe Act Under Pressure and we can let it ride for like this whole process, like this is [laughs] “Duck performing surgery” roll, and we will, we’ll see how it goes. That’s plus cool.
Justin: All right.
Griffin: All right!
Justin: Seven. That’s more like it. Now we’re cooking with dice.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Seven plus—
Justin: [crosstalk] Plus cool—
Travis: [crosstalk; like a TV show host] Cooking with dice!
Justin: [chuckles] Uh, nine.
Griffin: Uh, nine! Okay. On a mixed success, the keeper’s gonna give you a worse outcome, a hard choice, or price to pay. I think the price to pay is… the goat man just screams. Just screams, as soon as the alcohol touches the wound, he screams, and looks terrified, has like, it’s like he’s never felt pain before? And this is a very bad pain? And he screams, and then, I think faints. And is— is now just, uh, completely unconscious. Which is gonna help things, but uh, as he screams, above you, because this is the cellar beneath the Amnesty Lodge, you hear a chair scoot back? You hear like the [chair-across-floor screeching noise] and then you hear footsteps sort of rushing toward the front door. And Barclay looks up at you, and his eyes get wide, and he says:
Barclay: Uh uh I-I-I got this? I guess keep sewing him up?
Griffin: Barclay almost looks like he’s like, uh, you know how like when you get in a really bad situation that you’re completely out of your depth, it can be almost like… funny? [Justin: Yeah.] Like you almost are like “this sucks, so bad?” I think he’s kinda in that state? He’s like, “oh good, somebody’s coming down to check on the monster we kidnapped.” He races up the cellar stairs and shuts the door behind him, and you actually hear him talking to Agent Stern, just outside of the cellar. What else do you do?
Duck: Uh, all right. So we, uh, gotta, uhhh… [thinking noises] Let me get the suture kit, uhhh, out here. I’m really [sigh], oh man…
Travis: Now, I am curious, how much of is this Duck not knowing what to do, and how much is Justin not knowing what to do? [laugh]
Justin: I mean I’m trying, it’s little bit of, you know, I try to bring a little bit of myself to every character I play, Trav. [Travis and Clint laugh] Uhhh, alright.
Griffin: I don’t know— I don’t know why Duck Newton would have more surgical experience than Justin McElroy [Justin: Right.], and so I’m totally fine with how this is playing out.
Duck: I, listen, uh, I’m gonna be, here’s the one thing I will say to you, the one thing I don’t know is, like, anaesthesia, I wouldn’t begin to know how much to dose you for that, so this is gonna hurt a lot, man, I’m really… uh, I’m really sorry. Do you wanna bite down on something, or? All right…
Griffin: Uh, the goat is unconscious.
Duck: It’s unconscious. All right, well, at least there’s that. Uh, all right, so, I neeeeeeed the… needle driver, and uh, the— the forceps, and scissors, needle and thread—
[Griffin laughing]
Travis: Somebody’s googled!
Griffin: [Laughing] A phone with Google on it.
Justin: This is what it says on the inside of the suture kit. I’m reading the inside of the suture kit, okay?
Griffin: [Amused] Okay.
Justin: These are the things that are in there.
Griffin: Sure. Let’s not, for some of our more squeamish listeners, let’s not do an in-depth, you know, nasty suture scene.
Justin: How ‘bout this: I sew him up.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And I, yeah. Duck has probably sewed things before, so he is competent at least at that, and then he knows to like put some like antiseptic on it, cover with clean bandages, et cetera, et cetera.
Griffin: Yeah. Well, let’s hop into like, in the middle of this process, I’m not— we’re gonna let that nine roll, and the price to pay is that Barclay was sort of peeled off. Uh, while you were in the middle of this process, it is uh, it’s starting to get a little bit later in the day. As you are in the middle of sewing, uh, I think you are startled as you hear from behind you:
Minerva: Duck Newton! Are you prepared for t— [pause] Duck Newton? What is the meaning of this?
Griffin: And behind you, uh, appears Minerva.
Duck: Minerva, your timing sucks. Um, I, [sighs]. This goat…person… man, whatever, was— got hurt, and I’m just trying to, uh, keep it together long enough to save its life. You don’t know anything about… sutures, do you? I don’t even know if you have flesh, actually, come to think of it, right? You’re like a ghost.
Minerva: I’m not a ghost, Duck Newton, I have f— is this creature you’re tending to a foe?
Duck: Ah, you know, I don’t know. I think so. My gut tells me that this guy and his buddies are what’ve been responsible for some of the bad stuff that’s been going down lately, I can’t say for sure, but uhhh, yeah, I mean, I… Beacon almost cut his head off, and like, I felt like shit about it honestly, and he was hurt and I was just trying to fix him up. I don’t know, for um, for information, you know? We could grill him, or something.
Griffin: She shakes her head, and she says:
Minerva: Beacon tried to do what Beacon is supposed to do, what you’re supposed to do! It— Duck Newton, dispatch this beast at once. It’s vulnerable to you! Strike true! Drive your beacon into its heart!
Duck: Uhh, listen— I was about to say let’s put it to a vote, but—
Beacon: Yes, let’s see how—
Duck: No, we’re not doing that. I’m not going to kill an unarmed, unconscious creature in cold blood! I’m not gonna do it. Especially when I don’t know what his intent is!
Griffin: She shakes her head and looks down for a minute. And we’ve talked about how you always see her in silhouette so it’s actually kinda hard to read her, but she is, she is furious. You can tell just her like, from her body language. And she says:
Minerva: Your job is not to befriend your foe, Duck Newton, it is to vanquish them. It is to leave them no quarter, no hope to which to cling. Your calling is to paint your besieged homeland in the blood of those who would see your world destroyed! Now strike, Duck Newton!
Duck: You listen to me. I’m gonna save this weird goat, and then I’m gonna try to teach it English or some shit [Clint laughs], and I can figure out what’s going on here. If you continue to push me to kill this thing, I will walk away from all of this. And if you need evidence that I am not kidding with you, look at the past fucking 20 years, Minerva. I’m gonna do this on my own terms. Now, unless you can hold a thread, I would ask that you leave me the fuck alone, and let. Me. Sew.
Griffin: She freezes, and she puts a hand to her forehead, um, and you can see her silhouette starts to tremble a little bit, and she says,
Minerva: I— I…
Griffin: And then she disappears. And you finish your operation. And the goat man stabilizes. He’s still unconscious, he is— and again, this is probably something you’ve seen on the trail, maybe with some of the gnarlier sort of injuries that have come through the ranger station [Justin: Mmhm], he’s in shock. And he is, he is alive, and not bleeding anymore, and you can actually tell you actually did pretty good stitches here.
And umm, he is laid out to rest, and you, I— I— it’s a couple hours later, and you’re keeping an eye on him, and something happens that hasn’t really happened before, which is twice in the same night, Minerva comes back. Usually she just comes at the same appointed time that she always comes back, and now she’s making a second appearance.
And she shows up, as you sort of see her appear, she is standing still, and you hear that blues music that you heard so many months ago, when she tried to appear to you, and you saw her sort of frozen in place. Um, and you can’t hear her, and you get the impression she can’t hear you, and she becomes unfrozen, and sorta holds up a finger, sort of telling you wait, and eventually that music fades, and she speaks, and she says:
Minerva: I owe you an apology, Duck Newton! I was trained in my order’s temple for nearly a century, but it seems that you just— you can’t train temperance, can you.
Duck: Listen, I’m sorry that I kinda snapped at you. I was under a lot of pressure, and I’ve never had to sew a … well, neither a goat nor man, to say nothing of a goat man, so it was pretty intense.
[Clint laughs]
Minerva: Yes, I … I hope you don’t think less of me, Duck Newton. Um, training a champion remotely like this requires— it requires absolute trust, and if that trust was harmed, Duck Newton, it would make me a less effective tutor to you.
Duck: Nah, we’re fine, just try to remember next time. I don’t know a lot about sword fighting, and you know, flips, and kicks, and stuff, but I spent my whole life trying to figure out how I think about stuff, and in the woods you get a lot of time to sorta go back and forth on that sort of thing, and... I know where I stand, Minerva. I know where I stand.
Griffin: She sits down, which you’ve never seen. You see her pull something, actually, she walks away from you, and you see her sort of miming almost, as if she’s pulling a chair over, and she sits down. And she takes her hand, is kinda rubbing it over her bald head, and she looks at you and she says:
Minerva: I think that will serve you better than any training I could ever give you, Duck Newton. Um. My… [sighs] There are things I haven’t told you Duck Newton, because if I told you them, they would damage the trust that we have, that trust that is imperative to this process. My rage towards your world’s assailants, Duck, is born of my own world’s destruction. My— my home, Duck, my planet. Mira-Lavineax Orbital Body Five. Or Five, for short. It’s a bit of a mouthful— it was, it too was connected to another place, far-flung from our own world, and like your world, ours become tethered, and the beings that poured through that fissure, Duck… We lost, and we kept losing. And that is why my passion manifests as fury, Duck. I know your toil, and it makes me tired.
Griffin: She says. And I— I wanna drive home, you have never seen anything like this [Justin: From her, yeah] from Minerva. She is always sort of this larger than life, always bombastic, sort of uh, warrior-champion, um, and, this is not, this is not that.
Duck: I’m, uh… Damn, Minnie. I’m really sorry about your world, and everything. That’s— that’s tough.
Griffin: She puts up a hand, and stands up, and she says,
Minerva: Please, just forget about this conversation, Duck Newton. You need further training, and my lessons will not be as effective without your complete trust.
Griffin: She looks around and she says:
Minerva: My time is almost up. Your visions, Duck, are you still having your visions?
Duck: Yeah, um… they’re kinda back and forth on whether or not they’re helpful or not, but I’m still getting them.
Minerva: And your latest vision?
Duck: Uhh, yeah, it was a real barn burner, [laughs] honestly. A meteor destroying everything. It was pretty intense.
Griffin: She takes a step back and she says,
Minerva: Are you abs—
Griffin: And then she vanishes.
{42:05}
Griffin: Okay, Ned, you are in the sheriff’s office—you’re not in a cell or anything like that, I think you’re just sort of in a holding room. There’s a table and… Deputy Dewey has come in a couple of times just to make sure that, y’know, “Do you need anything, do you need some coffee or a Diet Coke, or…?” Those are really your two options. I guess water, you could also have? Just sort of making sure that you’re taken care of, you are not a prisoner at this time.
Ned: Cronuts…? Any chance that you have cronuts?
Deputy Dewey: I mean, I could whip you up some donuts?
Ned: Uh, cronuts. It’s sort of, like, half-croissant, half donut— and I don’t mean, like, left side is a croissant, other side is donut— it’s sort of like a donut, but with layers and— nevermind. That’s alright. No…
Deputy Dewey: I mean, I’ll get on AltaVista and find a recipe…
Griffin: [Chuckling] And he walks out of the room, off to AltaVista. And a few moments later, Sheriff Zeke walks in, and he sits down across from you and he… doesn’t really know how to treat you. Your last interaction with him was on the front porch of his house as you were trying to get Calvin to come out and help you fight the water monster. And he brushes his hair back and he says:
Sheriff Zeke: I need you to start by telling me why you were at Leo’s place when the Pizza Hut sign fell down.
Ned: Uh… picking up a ‘za! We had ordered— I think it was… they had a buy one get one? They had a bogo? With two toppings? And breadsticks. And… y’know, the weather was so bad, I didn’t want some other poor citizen out driving around in that crap! So, um, I was driving down there to pick it up myself, and… just happened to notice the impending disaster and… well, being the hero that I am, I sprang into action to help Leo and all of his friends.
Sheriff Zeke: And with the funicular, you just happened to be there also when the brakes failed?
Ned: Well, we were going to go do a little snowboarding. My friend, Jake Cool-Ice, had told me that there was some rad— thrashing boarding going on there, man, so we were heading down to, uh, y’know, hit the powder, as they say. Because I was so shook after the Pizza Hut thing, I needed to get my mind off of it, and… it just seemed like a little extreme board action was just what the doctor ordered.
Griffin: He chuckles, and he says:
Sheriff Zeke: Well, I got a theory. You wanna hear it?
Ned: Of course!
Sheriff Zeke: I think, maybe, business has been a bit slower at the Cryptonomica since your big Bigfoot sighting and… I think, maybe, you’re trying to drum up a bit of holiday traffic. Trying to make some supernatural mischief happen all around town. Maybe chalk it up to, I don’t know, man, the Jersey Devil or some sort of alien or something?
Ned: Well, let me ask you a theoretical question: would something like that be, y’know, a misdemeanor, or would that be, like, a felony…? Y’know, just pranking around like that? I mean, I’m not saying I did, but, I mean, if that were something… that would probably be a minor… something you could pay with a small fine, right?
Sheriff Zeke: One: no. Two: that’s not a denial, Ned.
Ned: Well, then I’ll deny it. Categorically deny it. Y’know, I have other ways of promoting—you know, I have a new TV show, it’s the, um… Saturday Night Dead. We’re having a Krampus festival, did you know that? A holiday… Krampus, Krampus 2, Krampus Unleashed—matter of fact, if you would like to be on the show, I would love to have you make a guest appearance!
Griffin: He smiles and he says:
Sheriff Zeke: Yeah, I seen your show, Ned… I like those old movies.
Ned: Thank you.
Griffin: And he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and he says:
Sheriff Zeke: You mind?
Griffin: And he starts to light one up.
Ned: No, certainly not. … Not a lot.
Griffin: [Chuckles] He smiles and he says:
Sheriff Zeke: Ned, I know that you and I, we have our differences in how we think this town should run, but… I know you didn’t have anything to do with the train. It’s a bit curious how your car ended up tangled up, but I guess you stopped it from killing ol’ Mark, so I guess we do owe you, I don’t know, man, a key to the city or somethin’? I’ll talk to the mayor, I dunno.
I know that… Ned, I see every stiff that comes through this place. Do you think I don’t know that something’s wrong with this town? You’re fairly new in town, Ned, you never got to meet Sheriff Nealy, he served before me, taught me everything I know. He died in the woods, back in 1991. Bear attack, they said. So, I took over his office.
It’s been nearly 30 years since then, Ned, people still wish they had him over me, and I don’t blame ‘em, cause there’s plenty of folks in this town who know enough to be afraid. You were at the tram and you were at Leo’s, I bet you had something to do with H2-Woah debacle that happened a few months back, too… all I wanna know is what’s going on in my town, Ned, so I can stop it. If there’s anything you know, anything that can help me out, anything that sounds beyond belief… I’ve tried everything else. I’m all ears, Ned Chicane.
Ned: Sheriff… may I call you Zeke? Good. You know what? I’m just gonna tell you the truth. I’m just gonna spill the beans. Now, that isn’t such a big deal because I’m not really sure what the beans are. But I think we’re on the same side! I think we’re both on the side of the angels, whoever the angels are, and there’s weird shit going on around here, and it sounds like it’s been going on for a long, long while!
And I’m hooked up with a couple of people that are… I’ve come to kind of care about and depend on and… and they’re involved in some wild, crazy shit! And I just kinda go along for the ride. I don’t have any answers, except to tell you: you’re right! There’s something really weird going on, and I would just as soon have you for a friend and an ally as an opponent! So, I’m not sure what I can tell you, because I’m kinda clueless.
Griffin: Let’s firm this up: are you wanting to initiate Sheriff Zeke to the best of your ability? I know that you’re saying that Ned is fairly clueless, and I don’t know how much of that is your understanding of what Ned knows, ‘cause, I mean, Ned went to another planet, right. Ned went to another planet, Ned has killed two Abominations, Ned knows about the Pine Guard— Ned knows quite a bit. Are you letting on a little bit without sort of giving away the whole thing, or what’s… what’re you doing with Ned right now?
Clint: To be honest with you, I think Ned feels a little overwhelmed? And I think, you know, Ned has spent all these stories, basically— I mean, he’s gotten closer to Duck and to Aubrey, uh, but you know, at his very heart Ned’s not a hero, and I think he’s kinda looking for any kind of support he can get. No, I don’t think he wants to tell the Sheriff everything but I think, maybe there are things about himself that maybe it’s time for him to, you know, break down the facade a little bit for somebody who might be able to help him.
Griffin: Uh, okay. He says:
Sheriff Zeke: I need you to understand where I’m coming from, Ned. I’m— I don’t believe in the bullshit that you peddle at the Cryptonomica, let alone the idea that there are actual things that go bump in the night. Are you saying that, there is some sort of supernatural danger here in Kepler?
Ned: Let me put it to you this way Sheriff, because I don’t think I have done anything illegal… lately. There’s something going on here, and I guess the way I would put it to you is: maybe you ought to buy a little bit of the bullshit that is the Cryptonomica. Maybe you should have an open mind and when I can tell you more, I will tell you more.
Griffin: When you say specifically “you should buy some bullshit from the Cryptonomica,” I think he laughs out loud, and lets you sort of finish your thought, and he puts out his cigarette and he says,
Sheriff Zeke: I don’t know why the fuck I’m talking to you about this, Ned Chicane, I don’t why I thought I was gonna be able to get a straight answer outta you. I tell you what, you’re not under arrest or anything, but why don’t you sit in here for a bit, and I gotta file some paperwork, and then I’ll come and, uh, we can get you home. [Forcefully] How’s that sound, Ned?
Ned: [Forceful, insincere] Sounds great, Zeke.
Griffin: And uh, he stands up, and I think he stands up pretty fast, I think his chair actually falls over as he does so. And he’s a bit little pissed off, he thinks you’ve sort of taken him for a ride a little bit, I think he’s mostly angry at himself for like allowing himself to sort of start to buy into it? And I don’t want to sort of take away the fact that you are opening up a bit to him, I think that you have said things to him that are going to sink in, but I think in this very moment I think he’s thinking, “I just wasted my fucking time,” and he storms out of the holding room.
And you’re sitting in this holding for a little bit, and I think just being in a sheriff’s office kind of takes you back, maybe returns your thoughts to all of the other, um, corrective institutions you have, uh, been fortunate enough to visit during your career of burglary? I wanna, we haven’t really talked much about Ned’s history, and so I like wanna get into it a little bit as long as we have this, like, solo scene. And I don’t know how much thought you’ve given to this, but how did Ned get into burglary?
Clint: I think Ned has— he kinda saw himself as like a Robin Hood, you know, almost like a treasure hunter. Ned just had the physical gifts, the mental gifts, for [laughs] for theft! Never anything armed robbery or anything like that, he was more of a cat burglar. [Griffin: Sure.] And usually, tried to steal things that had been stolen, so that he was stealing them from thieves. And that’s where a lot of the—
Griffin: Now, I do wanna address the fact that you have stolen so far, canonically, an Oscar I think from Clooney, you’ve stolen a NERF gun prototype from the inventor of nerfs, I don’t know that necessarily they were thieves.
Clint: Not exclusively… Robin Hood…
Griffin: [Laughs] Okay, maybe once or twice you stole something from thieves and that’s how you sleep at night, but most of the time it is sort of—
Clint: Well, I think he started off as just a flat out burglar who liked to collect weird shit.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: But then I think he kinda saw… There was an incident in his past where he saw that that was not good, and he basically had a life-changing moment. He had an incident where he just decided this was not for him anymore.
Griffin: I do also want to drive home that the final burglary you ever did was Aubrey’s house, which I don’t necessarily know that that was an entirely altruistic heist. And we can get into that, that you know, maybe that one was a bad one [chuckles].
Clint: That was, that was— that’s what I’ve been thinking.
Griffin: Okay, that was like a nice opportunity, and so you kinda broke your own rules a little bit just to get the sweet score. Okay, we also haven’t talked much about your partner. So let’s like— I don’t know if you have any ideas as to like how the two of you met, but I have like kind of a scene I think could be fun? Um, if you’re cool with that?
Clint: Go for it. Go for it.
Griffin: So you are— it’s a long time ago, I don’t think you’re in West Virginia, you are— you tell me, did you have a base of operations for your cat burglary operation, or were you just sort of all over the place?
Clint: … No, nah, he just kinda traveled. He loved traveling by train, by rail. And he never had, like, a locked down base of operations. Or bivouac.
Griffin: Okay. Let’s say you’re in Connecticut somewhere, in a fairly rural part of Connecticut, where the houses are nice and they are secluded. You are in the middle of… not, like, a huge haul, but a safe haul, which, I think, for a career burglar is what you go for. It’s not all about the, like, Ocean’s Eleven million-dollar getaways as much as it is the grind “I can do this and not get caught”.
You are actually in the middle of a house that is being fumigated. So, the family is not present. There are some neighbors nearby, but you are inside this house that is inside a giant tent and you have a uh, a gas mask on that is protecting you from the bug spray that is happening in this house. And I think you can maybe even smell it, a little bit, inside the gas mask, but it is protecting you from harm. And as you are sort of poking around this house and having a leisurely robbery, um, you turn a corner into an office and you see a figure actually also robbing this room of its valuables. And this figure turns towards you, and he’s wearing a gas mask too, and the two of you are just kind of… frozen in place as you run into another burglar in the middle of this scene… of your crime. Uh, what do you do?
Ned: Um, pardon me, sir. Uh, I’m, uh, Larry, I’m with Terminix. You are really not supposed to be in here while we are fumigating… while we are uh, clearing out this residence. So you… you probably need to leave immediately.
Bob: Okay, well I’m um… Bob. From Pest Blasters 5000, and you’re not suppo— [amused] what are we doing?
Ned: What?
Bob: Are— are we both going to pretend then that we are both in the trade of killing bugs or are we going to fess up? This is… I have to admit, I don’t know the protocol here. This is uh, this is unprecedented for me.
Ned: Look, there’s obviously been some kind of advanced scouting mistake, uh… you are obviously well entrenched here. Why don’t I just, why don’t I just leave you to it, and let you get about whatever the hell it is that you’re doing, and I will find another place to, quote unquote, “Get rid of vermin.”
Griffin: He says, uh,
Bob: Alright there, Larry. That works for me. I’ve scouted this place out for quite some time, and uh need, I’m a little cash light right now so I could use the um—
Griffin: And through the tent, you can see through the windows, it’s like this big red and yellow circus tent almost, you see lights flashing against the side of the tent. Blue and red lights. And, uh, you know that there are police officers outside. And Bob says,
Bob: Well, uh, Larry. [Laughing] It seems like we’re… well and proper fucked, huh?
Ned: Yes, but, do you know of uh, any back door to the house, or root cellar, or anything so we can get unfucked by leaving?
Griffin: He just starts moving at this point because you hear officers start approaching the front door and start trying to figure out how to, like, get through this bug tent. And he runs to the back door and tries to open it, and sees that the tent is sort of surrounding it also, and then runs to a basement door, which he tries to open, but finds its securely padlocked and he starts trying to kick it down and its not working.
Ned: Please, allow me. Do you mind?
Griffin: He steps back, and Bob allows you access to the lock.
Clint: I know I can do this.
Griffin: Uh, probably Act Under Pressure.
Clint: Act Under Pressure? Alright, Act Under Pressure. Alright, so…
Griffin: Is this one— let’s establish this, I know— I don’t think you have, like, a skill that’s like, or uh, or you tell me actually. I don’t know:
Clint: Well there’s burglary…
Griffin: Yeah this is your first time actually doing some burglary even though it’s, like, in a flashback. And uh, the Crooked, let’s see… “When you break into a secure location, roll plus sharp. On a plus-10 pick 3, on a 7-9 pick 2: You get in undetected, you get out undetected, you don’t leave a mess, you find what you were after. So let’s do that. We have never done that roll before.
Clint: Alright.
Griffin: And we can say that this break into a secure location is this robbery.
Clint: I rolled a 7 +2 sharp.
Griffin: So that would be nine. Okay so pick two. You get in undetected… let’s take that one off the table. You got in undetected until I guess you ran into another burglar in this place. You get out undetected, you don’t leave a mess, you find what you were after.
Clint: [Amused] We get out undetected!
Griffin: Sure, and you get one more. You don’t leave a mess, you find what you were after.
Clint: Okay, find what you were after.
Griffin: Okay! I think that just means like, you get a sack of loot. [Laughs] You did very well on this robbery. And I think that Bob did too, Bob also has a satchel that he has stuffed full of stuff. And, uh, you manage to get the basement door open and run down the stairs and uh, Bob turns on a flashlight, he actually has a head mounted flashlight, and you see some stairs leading up to a cellar door that is unsecured and unlocked. And Bob pushes it open, and the two of you hop a fence, and make it out okay. I think actually that Bob helps you up over the fence first. It’s a very, very tall fence, and you actually hear police officers coming around the side of this backyard that you are in and start opening up the gate that would allow them access. So he is moving quickly, and actually lets you get up… first? Which is maybe more noble than the average burglar? And he manages to skitter up the fence himself and the two of you manage to get off to safety.
And after you’ve made it a certain distance, you come to a hill by the roadside where these police officers are and the two of you roll down it and are sort of laying with your backs up against it waiting for the police officers to leave and Bob takes off his mask. And uh, what’s— what’s your partner look like? We also don’t know his name; I’m sort of leaving that up to you unless you wanna keep calling him Bob and Larry, which is fun, but it’s also the Veggie Tales.
Clint: Boyd… Mosche… is his name. M-O-S-C-H-E. Boyd Mosche. Um, he’s uhhh, a big guy. Like Michael Phelps, kinda tall, you know, fairly athletic. And just a hard looking guy. He’s— He’s just, he looks, you know what I mean? I mean he looks like a… he looks like a badass.
Griffin: Okay, we can leave it at that, and just sort of leave the rest up to the audience’s imagination. He takes off his mask and you see this, you know, this— this chiseled jaw. This very physical looking dude, who takes the mask off and looks over at you and kinda like gives you a kinda like panicked smile. The two of you kind of lay there… quietly for a bit? Until the cars start to roll away. And he uh, he looks up, and makes sure the coast is clear, and he comes back down to you on the hill and gives you a thumbs up and says uh:
Bob: That was a bit closer than I uh, I like to come to the fuzz. Um, alright, you seem trustworthy… as trustworthy as we come.
Griffin: And he offers you a hand and he says:
Boyd: Boyd Mosche.
Ned: Hello Boyd, nice to meet you. My name is Arturo Copperthwaite.
Griffin: He shakes your hand, and he laughs, and he says,
Boyd: No it isn’t.
[Ad break]
Griffin: Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy, your dungeon master, your best friend, and your… thirsty boy. And I don’t— I don’t mean that in the horny way, I mean I require fluid.
{1:05:19 - 1:10:16}
[music]
Griffin: So, Aubrey, you have headed to Sylvain. Um, I think that— let’s address this. Have you been back to visit Janelle and like do your magic lessons? It’s been a couple of months now since you were sort of first introduced to the world of Sylvain and Janelle sort of told you to come back and she— she wants to study you just as much as you want to learn from her. Is this the first time that that has happened or have you done this a couple of times now?
Travis: I— I would say that, like, it’s probably happened a couple of times um but very, like, cursory check in, no big advancements or anything along those lines. Like, thing as if we are talking in terms of Karate Kid, this is still like the paint the fence, wash the car kind of thing, and not—
Griffin: Yeah. Or to like, put it in the terms that we’ve already established, she has studied you and you have not learned anything from her. Which is probably frustrating. “Do your thing, do your thing, do your thing, I want to test your natural aptitude before we actually get into the…” and maybe you’ve started to think “Maybe she can’t teach me anything…?” Which is probably really frustrating to, like, be able to use magic and not trust this person is gonna be able to help you improve it or make it safer.
So you are in her chambers, in the castle in the center of the city. And this room is incredibly spartan. There is just a single desk in the middle of the room with a single book and a cup of tea on the desk. She keeps things super simple in here so she can focus absolutely on like the text she is studying at any given time. And as you enter, she gestures to sort of a large clearing in the room where there is a big circular rug laid out and she has had you sort of stand in the middle of that each time you’ve come in, and she says:
Janelle: Okay Aubrey, it’s been a couple of weeks now and, let’s see how things are coming along!
Aubrey: [Hesitant] No.
Griffin: I don’t think that she has any patience for this shit whatsoever, she like— she, this is a person that is responsible for discovering the magical cure that will save this world. As soon as you say no she says,
Janelle: Okay!
Griffin: And she stands up [crosstalk] and she walks over to her desk—
Aubrey: No you— no you don’t— you don’t understand. Can I— can we talk for a second?
Griffin: Uh, she sets her book back down on the desk and she sits down in this rotating chair at the desk, which she rotates around to face you as you stand in the middle of this rug and she says,
Janelle: Okay! But I only have a few moments. What would you like to talk about?
Aubrey: Wh— When I use magic, people keep getting hurt? And… I… can you make it… can you please take the magic away, please.
Griffin: [Surprised laugh/hum]
Aubrey: I don’t wanna do it anymore. I can’t control it, and I just end up hurting people that I love and I don’t— I don’t wanna do it anymore. Please.
Griffin: In all of her years of doing this, I don’t actually know how long she’s been the Minister of the Arcane but she’s been like— she has known how magic has worked in this world for a while and has been a tutor to many, many people in its ways, uhh, she is taken back by this question. You get the impression that nobody has ever asked for this before. And um, and, I’m trying to decide out how she takes it, because you’ve actually caught me off guard uh, quite a bit. And she says,
Janelle: Aubrey, I apologize. I have perhaps spent too much of our time together learning from you, without imparting my own wisdom to you. And for that, I believe I have wronged you. I need you to understand though, I cannot take your power away from you, Aubrey, because it doesn’t belong to you. It doesn’t… come from you. Do you want to know where this magic comes from?
Aubrey: Yes.
Janelle: What does it feel like when you conjure the phenomena that you conjure?
Aubrey: I mean it’s hard to describe but you know how when like, you are getting tickled, and you laugh, and you don’t really laugh on purpose. And— but— it feels right and natural to do but you are not really thinking, like, laugh now. You are not reacting to a joke it’s just that— that the outcome— like I can’t think that I would like to make fire now but it’s there… when it’s the right reaction to have…? Does this make any sense?
Griffin: Uh, she stands up from her desk and um walks over to this pot and small ceramic cup and she pours you a cup of tea and walks over to you and hands it to you and this is already way more warmth than Janelle has ever shown you? And she says,
Janelle: It is a reflex.
Aubrey: [Relieved] Yeah, yeah it is like that.
Janelle: That is not how it is for me at all, but that is what is so fascinating about you, Aubrey. And, I know that it must be frustrating, your mistakes that you have made with your magic, but these kinds of mistakes are to be expected! Obviously yours have been maybe a bit more destructive than most, but your magic doesn’t work the same way as everybody else’s.
Griffin: She pulls out a— she can see you getting frustrated and she says,
Janelle: Let’s start with brass tacks.
Griffin: And she walks over to a shelf and pulls out a scroll which she unfurls on her desk. And she kinda beckons you over off of your training rug — which is something I think you use to kennel break dogs so maybe there’s a different word for it — and she gestures to this parchment and you see a map of the planet of Sylvain. And there are these lines that criss-cross the entirety of the map, almost like parallels and meridians on an Earth map, and the all connect in the middle. Not in like the middle of the depicted surface of the planet, but in the center of the planet. And she says
Janelle: I cannot take your power away because it is not yours. It is the planet’s. Every planet, Aubrey, ours, yours, all the planets in the sky are living beings. And I don’t mean that in a new age kind of way, I mean that quite literally; it is a living, sentient, being. We named ours Sylvain, you named yours Earth. They likely have names far more ancient than those but we need to call them something. And like you’ve figured out, magic doesn’t work like it does in your stories. You don’t cast fireball when you want to summon a fireball, when we use magic we aren’t channelling some energy within ourselves, we are beseeching the planet to change itself, to meet our needs. Improving your magic, Aubrey, making your magic safer, is simply a process of learning how to ask for that power more specifically. It’s— it’s to become a better conversationalist.
Aubrey: I’m trying, I— it’s hard for me, I’m not— you know, I’m not a good listener. Are there other types of magic besides just like, the fireballs, you know, I— can you teach me how to heal?
Janelle: There is no healing magic, Aubrey, just as there is no fireball magic, there is no earthquake magic. You ask for healing, and if you ask correctly and your voice is heard, the planet will… heal! You are thinking of this power as something you master, the specific channels of. It is not like that. You can do anything, Aubrey. As long as you ask for it and as long as the planet abides, but, where I struggle to teach you, Aubrey, is that the reflexive magic that you use, it is not like ours.
Our magic is so much more difficult. Which may be frustrating for you to hear, but there are those who train for decades, centuries, even, Aubrey, and can’t produce even more than a candle flame. What you have done so quickly, this magic that comes as second nature to you, it is unique among any creature who has ever walked the— either of our planets before you.
Aubrey: But why? I don’t deserve it, I can’t use it, I hurt people— I don’t want to hurt people anymore.
Janelle: Then… don’t! I don't know how to put it any more clearer than that.
Griffin: She gestures for you to actually sit down on the chair, she sees you, like, getting upset.
Janelle: The reason that you have been hurting people Aubrey, is because you don’t understand what you are capable of. It is a kind of doubt. And I know it doesn’t work like this I don’t have perhaps the best… people skills, I know you can’t just tell a person not to doubt anymore. But that doubt has kept you from knowing your full potential, Aubrey. It has not allowed to learn the difference between burning flame and a healing, warming flame. You have to lean into this power, Aubrey, if anything else, walking away is not going to do you any good. A dull knife is far, far more dangerous than a sharp one. Does any of this make sense?
Aubrey: Yes… but… it doesn’t change the fact that I’m afraid.
Griffin: She smiles, actually, when you say that and she says,
Janelle: [Laughs] Now that is one thing that I do understand.
Griffin: And she walks over to the window of this room and opens it, and opens the curtain in front of it and gestures outside and you see the courtyard outside of the castle, with that big orange crystal and the line of Sylvains waiting to receive their allotment of power from it. And she gestures towards this scene and she says,
Janelle: What do you see, when you look out there?
Aubrey: I— I see a crystal that I’m not allowed to touch.
Griffin: She smiles. She says:
Janelle: That is the last hope of a people that is yet to realize that the land that they walk on is dying. It scares the hell out of me, Aubrey. There are those that believe that the centuries of assaults on ours world from yours has left Sylvain weakened and unable to support the life that clings to her surface. There are those that believe her affliction is terminal, that the planet is dying, that the corruption that lies beyond our city’s gates is just one of the many symptoms that accompany the… sunsetting of our world. Or maybe it’s already dead. Maybe we are just siphoning the last bit of warmth from—
Griffin: And you hear someone clear their throat by the entrance to Janelle’s chambers, and as you look towards it, you see the young girl who greeted you on your first visit to Sylvain. The interpreter, the sort of unofficial ruler of this land, and Janelle bows quickly as you can kinda tell that she’s embarrassed that the interpreter walked in during her talking about the end of the world, and the interpreter says:
The Interpreter: I apologize for my intrusion, Miss Janelle. Woodbridge seeks audience with you in my chambers. He has an adjustment to our rationing that requires approval of the full council.
Griffin: And Janelle turns back to you, Aubrey, and says:
Janelle: Aubrey, I know you are scared. But that fear, that fear is the reason why your powers are as unpredictable as they are. You need to trust yourself, Aubrey.
Griffin: She actually takes your hands, and she says:
Janelle: You are unlike anyone I’ve ever met. Your powers, [laughs] your powers rival my own, Aubrey. And you have been doing this for approximately 15 minutes. If I had what you had, I know I would have fixed this kingdom a long time ago. Your power is rare, and I know it is scary, but it is a beast you must tame, for the sake of both of our worlds.
Aubrey: [Solemnly] I’ll try.
Griffin: She nods, and walks out of the room. And the interpreter turns to face you and gives you a little bow, and she says,
The Interpreter: Again, my sincere apologies—
The Interpreter, in echoed tone: [Angrily] I wish she would stop coming here. It’s her world’s fault that Sylvain is dying in the first place.
Griffin: And the words you just heard did not match up to the mouth movements that she made. You get the impression that she actually asked you a question with the words she was speaking and she was waiting on a response.
Aubrey: I’m sorry?
Interpreter: I said, do you need an escort t—
Echoed Interpreter: She is just as bad as the rest of them. She’s just taking what she wants with no concern for our people.
Aubrey: Uh… uh, escort… back to the— is everything okay?
The Interpreter: Yes, everything’s okay I just—
Echoed Interpreter: God, she can’t even pay attention for a moment! Even in the presence of royalty!
Griffin: And with that she kind of, um, smiles and nods, and you get the impression that she just said bye to you in some way with her mouth words, and she starts to leave.
Aubrey: [Offended] Okay, bye!
Griffin: And… she walks out of the room. I think you find your own way out of the castle and as you sort of walk through the big double doors leading out of the castle, the serenity of this entry hall is shattered by this ringing of alarm bells in the distance off to the west by this huge wall that surrounds this city, protecting it from the darkness beyond. And suddenly, all of the soldiers here in the entry hall rush out, and you see the courtyard evacuated as the guards out there also rush towards the sound of these bells. And the people waiting in line are scared and so frustrated that their wait has been interrupted, they clear out too. And a couple of guards rush past you and they say— they tell you to get to safety, because there is something trying to break through the wall at the edge of the city. And you are in the courtyard alone.
Travis: [Determined] I would like to touch the crystal now, Griffin.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Why don’t you Act Under Pressure for me. Tell me how are you touching the crystal?
Travis: Just like, so lightly, just like, because on one hand, okay, let me explain myself. On the one hand, Aubrey knows that she’s like, not supposed to. And like, after the kindness that Janelle has just shown, doesn’t want to like, ruin anything. But on the other hand, I think she really has it in her head that interacting with the crystal in some way will like recalibrate her, or power, its… something will unlock, or something she’s supposed to do.
Griffin: I love that. I love that not because I’m just saying, “You are correct, you’ve solved my crystal puzzle,” I love the idea that Aubrey is just like, “If I just touch the crystal I’ll be able to do magic again.” Okay.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: So are you just rushing up to it, are you proceeding with caution?
Travis: Yes, definitely caution and like, she’s just gonna like, touch it with one finger, um, and as she does, she says,
Aubrey: I’m sorry.
Travis: And then touches it. So I rolled a 6 and my Act Under Pressure— ooh, I don’t get any plusses. But I’m gonna use luck! Because this is very important—
Griffin: You are burning through that luck, my man.
Travis: I’ve only used 3!
Griffin: Okay, um… so that bumps you up to a 12. Correct, which is you do what you set out to accomplish, which means you touch the crystal unbothered. Okay, um, as you reach towards the crystal, like, just as the skin of your finger makes contact with it,
[reversed, haunting music begins]
It pulls in your whole hand. Your whole hand is in the surface of this crystal. Both of them are pulled in to its surface almost magnetically. You feel, Aubrey, you feel all of the moisture in your body is being pulled out through your palms. You can’t breathe, because you are convinced that in this moment there is nothing to breathe, you feel your consciousness falling away from you, almost like you were pushed down a well, and the world is getting much, much, much farther away.
The prevailing feeling you have right now, in this moment, is one of absolute certainty: that you are dying as you touch this thing. And, eventually, you push backwards off of the crystal. And you fall back, away from it. And as you fall, you haven’t taken any harm from this thing that has just happened as you touch the crystal, which is the good news. As you fall, you land in a flower bed. It is a bed of these beautiful wildflowers, just blooms of reds and whites and yellows and dark purples, all surrounding this crystal, spreading across just a huge swath of the courtyard. And they were not there a moment ago. They look beautiful; it’s kinda hard to appreciate them because you kinda feel like dogshit, a little bit, and as you sit up from these flowers, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the crystal. You are sweating up a storm, you look and feel a little feverish. There is one detail that really stands out. What color are Aubrey’s eyes?
Travis: Uh, they are... Brown. But in a kinda, like just a pretty light… [crosstalk] you know, ahh.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Like a hazel, maybe?
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: Is hazel brown?
Griffin: I— I have no idea. Uh, okay, your left eye is that color. Your right eye is now this dark orange hue, with like a starburst of lighter orange just around the pupil. And you catch a glimpse of your new eye color in just this one large smooth facet of the crystal, and its new tint is nearly fading away in the gemstone’s brilliant orange expanse.
[music]
It is the following morning, and the three of you have regrouped back in the Pine Guard HQ underneath the— underneath the Amnesty Lodge. Duck, what have you done with the goat man? I think the goat man has been— has been stabilized, and you sort of kept vigil throughout the night, and he seems to be okay. He had a little fever, actually, sort of in the early hours of the morning, but it has broken. He is still unconscious, and— do you just have him sort of loose still, sort of just like out on the table?
Justin: He is handcuffed to the table.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Can’t be too careful. The door to the, uh, InFURmary is—
[Travis and Griffin groan]
Griffin: Oh, man!
Travis: Oh, okay! Yeah!
Clint: Wooooo!
Justin: That’s locked—
Travis: Yeah, he did it!
Justin: And there’s a big sign that says, like, “Caution: Bird Flu,” or something. Yeah, it says that. [Griffin laughing] It says that, it says “Caution: Bird Flu.”
Griffin: Okay. So nobody—
Travis: Caution: Bird Flu Inside, and it’s kind of spelled out like the Walking Dead, you know?
{1:31:12}
Griffin: Okay, I like that. Are you trying to keep this thing secret from your— from Ned and Aubrey, or— what’s like your— ‘cause I don’t wanna— I didn’t imagine the Infirmary being its own—
Justin: No, they can know about it. I was trying to keep— I don’t want it to be, like— I don’t want to have to discuss this with everybody at Amnesty.
Griffin: Okay. All right. I mean, let’s have that scene, of you sort of revealing your new friend.
Duck: All right. Y’all come to the Infirmary for the second, I want to show you something.
Aubrey: What, and get bird flu?
Duck: I— yeah, it’s a clever ruse.
Ned: InFURmary! Okay, now I get it! Yeah!
Travis: Griffin, did Aubrey’s eye remain that orange color or is that just a temporary—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Aw yeah, baby. Oh yeah.
Travis: She’s wearing sunglasses, for sure.
Griffin: Okay!
Duck: So, um… you’re gonna feel some impulses so probably… get your dander up when we go in here. I need you just to keep it calm, I spent all fucking night trying to keep this thing alive.
Justin: And then I open the door to it.
Aubrey: Oh.
Duck: Yeah.
Ned: A goat.
Duck: Well, no, it’s, I mean you look at the legs and you can kind of see, [Ned gasps] yeah.
Ned: It’s Pan!
Duck: No—
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, we’re not crossing over.
Justin: [in Duck’s voice] No, it’s not. There’s no crossover here, sir. There’s no sat— there is nothing satirical about this creature.
Clint: I had to go there!
Justin: [in Duck’s voice] Ah, well I’m bringing you right back. Um, yeah.
Aubrey: Um, Duck?
Duck: Yeah?
Aubrey: Who is this?
Duck: I don’t know. It doesn’t speak English, or, like, Human, as near as I can figure. And I— Well, Beacon really, almost cut its head off, and you can see it kind of jacked me up pretty bad—
Aubrey: Uh-huh.
Justin: I think I’m healing okay— One harm, I’m fine—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, you’re totally fine, your one harm you had is gone by this point—
Duck: Yeah so, I was just hoping y’all would have some ideas.
Aubrey: About— Ideas about the goat man?
Duck: Yeah, like how to figure out its… plan? Now that I’m saying it it does sound pretty fucking dumb.
Aubrey: Um, excuse me, mister goat man? Um, could— what— hi!
Duck: Yeah we covered no English or Human tongues as far as I know.
Griffin: Um, are you—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Right right right.
Griffin: Um, the goat man is unconscious at this moment, are you trying to rouse it now to converse with it, Aubrey?
Travis: I mean, that seems like step one.
Griffin: Okay, um, it awakens—
Ned: Aubrey—
Griffin: [crosstalk] It awakens—
Ned: —ask him if his name is Mr. Tumnus.
Aubrey: I won’t be doing that, Ned.
Griffin: It awakens peacefully as you sort of rouse it and it sits up and sees the handcuffs attached to its wrist, I think it tries to pull away just like once and then it looks down and then kind of just stares at the three of you with just sort of obvious curiosity and—
Aubrey: H-Hi!
Griffin: It just looks at you, Aubrey, is staring at you.
Aubrey: My name is Aubrey. Hello. Are you okay?
Griffin: It doesn’t respond.
Ned: Have you tried feeding it?
Duck: Yeah, I mean, it’s had a fever, and I thought you were supposed to feed a cold, starve a fever, I thought that was it but I couldn’t remember—
Aubrey: Can we say them? It’s— like— it feels— [to goat man] I’m so sorry about them. Um, so—
Travis: And Aubrey points to the wound.
Aubrey: Are you feeling better? Does that hurt?
Duck: It doesn’t speak English. I mean, we can like—
Griffin: He points to— puts his hand on his wound and doesn’t really know how to respond or anything like that but he just reaches up and touches it and just puts his hand back down.
Aubrey: Okay, um, I’m gonna try something.
Travis: And Aubrey closes her eyes and says—
Aubrey: I would like to speak to this creature.
Griffin: Uh… okay. This is a— I’m guessing a Use Magic, what would this sort of— what category are you assuming this would fit under?
Travis: Um, so there’s actually part of Use Magic that is Speak To… let me see where it is…
Griffin: [Leaned back from mic] Communicate With Something You Do Not Share a Language With, holy shit!
Travis: [crosstalk] There it is.
Griffin: Fucking holy damn!
Travis: I’ve been waiting to use that shit this whole time, that’s a seven—
Clint: For five seconds.
Travis: No like since I saw that on there. That’s a 7+2, so a 9.
Griffin: Alright. You choose the effect and the glitch, okay, Aubrey? You pick one of the following glitches: the effect is weakened, the effect is of short duration, you take one harm ignore armor, the magic draws immediate unwelcome attention, or it has a problematic side effect.
Travis: Um… Ugh, see, I want to say “the effect is weakened.”
Griffin: Okay. Yeah that’s fine. Here’s what’s happened. You touch the goat man, and—
Justin: “Touch the Goat Man” was the name of my first studio album. [Laughter] It was not well received.
Clint: [Tune of Shock the Monkey] Touch the goat man! [Clint and Justin mimic guitar riff, Travis laughs.]
Griffin: You touch the goat man, Aubrey, and you make some magic. And it actually does feel a little bit different than it has felt in the past. Ned and Duck, you see this faint sort of orange light just sort of pulsate out of where Aubrey touches the goat man. And the goat man sort of— is a little scared of this at first and starts to pull away but then just kind of sits there for a bit and just sort of takes the touch. And Aubrey you pull your hand away and this goat man is now still looking at the three of you.
Aubrey: I’m Aubrey.
Griffin: It sort of— now it’s kind of scared again, because it just heard you say something. The goat man like, yelps a couple of times, just bleating, just—
Goat man: [bleating] Baaa. Baaa!
Griffin: And, uh, looks at you, Duck. I think this— he’s sort of looking at all of you panicked, but when it’s the most scared it looks to you because you are the one who saved its life and it definitely knows that.
Duck: Aubrey, I don’t mean to be judgey but it seems like your spell didn’t quite take hold.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Griffin: And with that the goat man stands up from the table and sort of gets yanked back by the handcuff attached to its wrist and looks at you Duck, and he smiles and he says—
Goat man: [clears throat] Duck!"

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Mama: So I went out and I tried to find Thacker. He left years ago. He kept records of his studies in his journals.
Griffin: The van is empty. All of these supplies and all of these tools are gone. They are not in the van.
Duck: We gotta get this thing back to the lodge. Or this person—
Barclay: [Stammering] Wh—
Duck: I know, I know, I know, but look at it, man. It's gonna die if we don’t do something.
Aubrey: I would like to speak to this creature.
Griffin: You see this faint sort of orange light pulsate out of where Aubrey touches this goat man. And the goat man stands up from the table and sort of gets yanked back by the handcuffs attached to its wrist, and looks at you, Duck, and he smiles. And he says,
Goat man: [clears throat] Duck!
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Travis: So, the goat man just said Duck’s name. Begin.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: Create.
Griffin: Uh, we’ll take it— let's just hop right back in. We're right in that moment where this goatman has just said your name, Duck, while staring at you, uh, with— just right in the peepers. He's got some yellow eyes with vertical slits? Sort of goat— I mean, they're goat eyes. [Travis: They're goat eyes.] He has the peepers of a goat, but a bipedal, sort of humanoid form. Uh, bit taller than you. And he has said,
Goat man: Duck!
Justin: I guess I should check with you, Griffin. This is the first time that any of us ever heard a goat man talk. Are there any sort of erotic awakenings that we need to be aware of? Just wanna check in.
Travis: Good question. Second—
Griffin: Technically, it's the second time, because you all have met Vincent, the goat man in Sylvain. [Travis: Oh, that's fair.] And I guess my follow-up question is, did that have any erotic awakenings? I will admit, I've been pretty unplugged from social media as of late, so I don't know what the erotic fan art of Vincent situation is, but I don't— I don't have my finger on that pulse anymore.
Clint: Pretty hot.
Travis: Well, to be fair, Griffin, Justin, I think, if I may, is both asking about our characters, but also us, the players. Within us, has that caused any awakenings?
Griffin: Sure, let's all roll to Act Under Pressure, I guess?
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: And I—
Travis: This is as Justin, Dad, and Travis.
Griffin: Yeah. If you roll poorly, you're gonna make a… hard move.
[Laughing]
Justin: Love that.
Travis: I got an 8?
Griffin: No, this is nothing.
Clint: Uh, I rolled a 6.
Griffin: Okay, you're into it.
Justin: You rolled a sex.
Griffin: And… and… unpause.
Goat man: Duck!
Aubrey: Holy shit! Duck?
Goat man: Duck!
Duck: Yeah… um… it's me, hey. Hey, little partner, how you feelin'?
Griffin: It sort of looks at the wound in its shoulder and touches it. Have you— I'm guessing you've dressed it, I'm imagining, with bandages, at some point. Or is it sort of just exposed stitches— it's almost certainly bandages, right?
Justin: Yeah, he's done a good job.
Griffin: Yeah, he touches his shoulder and kind of just nods a little bit, and gives what you sort of detect as, like, a faint smile.
Aubrey: Can you understand us? Yeah?
Griffin: It nods and says,
Goat man: Duck!
Aubrey: Cool.
Duck: Um… my name is Duck. I'm Duck. Welcome to English.
Travis: 101.
Justin: [Laughing] Yeah. Me llamo Duck.
Duck: Hey, uh, what are you doing here? Like, broadly speaking.
Griffin: It starts to gesture with both hands, and one of its hands is restrained to the table, still, with the handcuffs, and so it kinda gets pulled back, and it looks down at the handcuffs and tries pulling it a few more times. It looks confused about the concept of handcuffs. And it just kinda looks up at you, confused, and says,
Goat man: Duck.
Ned: We could probably dispense with those, couldn't we, Duck?
Aubrey: Um…
Duck: Ehm… yeah… yeah, let's kinda go ahead and get him untied.
Ned: Just as a gesture of goodwill.
Griffin: Sure. You pop off the handcuffs, and the goat man kinda rubs its wrist, and then gives another smile, this time to all three of you, and then says,
Goat man: Duck.
Duck: I— should I hug him? Like? I don't know what to do here.
Aubrey: Yeah, you know, I think, if I may, just kind of first things first. And this, if I may be a little blunt, new friend: are you all making the bad stuff happen?
Griffin: He looks sort of— he looks nervous. He looks nervous when you ask him this question. He looks, what's the right word, he looks sort of conflicted. And he… and then he looks down at the ground, he looks almost embarrassed now, and he nods his head up and down.
Ned: Are you making the bad stuff happen accidentally?
Griffin: Now he just looks fucking confused, ‘cause that's a very confusing question.
Aubrey: Do you have a good reason?
Griffin: The goat man looks up at you and says,
Goatman: Duck.
Griffin: And then [clears throat] clears his throat a few times and then says,
Goat man: Grow.
Griffin: Uh, he says, “grow” if you don't speak Griffin goat English.
Duck: Grow? What does he mean, grow?
Aubrey: Grow.
Ned: Is that why you took Danimal's tools? To help something grow?
Griffin: He looks excited, and he nods his head up and down, yes yes yes. And he actually kinda grabs you by the arms. Like, I think he's— this is so new to him, being able to converse with human beings, and the fact that he's just had a thought that he tried to get across, and then he succeeded in that, and somebody got it— he's, like, he’s totally stoked.
Aubrey: If you show us what you're growing, will that help us understand why you're doing what you're doing?
Griffin: All of a sudden, he remembers himself, and he lets go of Ned, and he looks sort of defeated. And now he just hops back up on the table and sits down and shakes his head no.
Clint: It's a pot farm. He's growing pot. Goat pot.
Griffin: The strongest pot known to man.
Travis: Goat weed. It's horny goat weed.
Aubrey: I thought we were getting somewhere. Um, Duck? He seems to like you, so…
Duck: Y— hey, partner. Let's clarify something. Do you mean us any harm?
Griffin: He is thinking very, very hard. And then he looks up at you and just kind of very slowly shakes his head no.
Aubrey: Okay…
Duck: All right… you know what? I can believe you, Duck. No, sorry.
Ned: Goat.
Duck: That's not y—
Goat man: Duck.
Duck: That's not your name, is it? That would be weird.
Aubrey: What a coincidence!
Griffin: He kinda tilts his head to the side, like, “Huh?”
Aubrey: Can we call you Jeff?
Griffin: He shrugs his shoulders. If that's really what you— is that sort of first thought, what you wanna name this character? I feel like maybe—
Clint: I think Billy would be our first choice, right?
Justin: Billy is good. Billy's better.
Travis: Billy is good. Yeah, Billy I like. ‘Cause you know what, maybe during those more serious times, he can be William.
Griffin: He nods in approval. “Okay, I am now Billy. I am Billy now.” Uh, you hear the cellar door open, and—
Travis: [Nervous sound]
Clint: Uh-oh.
Travis: Oh, no! Mom's home.
Griffin: Barclay is actually the one who comes down the stairs, and he looks sort of— he looks a little harried, and he—
Travis: Well, yeah, he's a bigfoot.
Griffin: Well, he's not right now. He runs into the room and sees the now-conscious goat man, and he looks kinda nervous, but then sort of surmises that you guys don't seem nervous, that everything's okay, and he says,
Barclay: Oh, okay, so, um… we just, like…we just, like have a goat man now?
Aubrey: Well, we don't have him, Barclay.
Duck: Yeah, we don't own him. He's a dear friend Aubrey: He's here, come on. that doesn't mean us any harm.
Barclay: I meant, like, on the team. Hahahaha.
Aubrey: Oh.
Barclay: Gang, I am… I am not entirely sure this is the best idea? Uh, if you wanna go along with it— what's, like, the plan with our new pal here?
Duck: Yeah, so I— we brought him in for… I'm about to say we brought him in for questioning, and I'm feeling dumb as I'm saying it, but that is about as close to a plan as I got. He got injured, see, and I brought him back here to save his life, and then—
Griffin: Uh, Barclay was there for that.
Duck: Oh, right. So you remember that.
Barclay: Yeah.
Duck: And then Aubrey gave him a magic spell to make him talk. And then—
Barclay: You can— you can do that?
Aubrey: Eh. I mean…
Ned: One word.
Aubrey: Apparently, yeah.
Griffin: And the goat man says,
Goat man: Duck!
Aubrey: Yeah. More, I gave him a spell to help him understand. He can hear, he can understand us now.
Goat man: Grow.
Aubrey: Yeah, we got “Duck” and “grow.”
Ned: Two words, two words.
Duck: “Duck” and “grow” [Aubrey: Duck, grow.] is about as far as we got.
Goat man: Pizza.
[Laughing]
Travis: Okay, hold on. Wait, hold on, the pizza sign. Is that something?
Goat man: Pizza.
Griffin: I didn't even think about that. I was making a joke, but sure, yeah, the pizza sign was there.
Travis: You can't make jokes, Griffin, I take this very seriously.
Griffin: No, yeah, no, you did a good job of connecting it to canon. Barclay says,
Barclay: Uh, how transparent are we gonna be about… our… I guess, not captive, but new pal?
Aubrey: Is there anybody upstairs who is a goat person? In real life? Or…
Griffin: I think you would know. Like, you've lived in Amnesty Lodge for a long time now. You know there is no—
Clint: Wait a minute, wait a minute, what about Vincent? Could we not call him in?
Travis: He can't come over.
Griffin: He can't come over, yeah. And you get the idea that maybe bringing this thing over into Sylvain is also not an awesome idea. Um, you all hear the phone ring upstairs, actually, and you hear Dani answer it. I mean, you hear it, like, through the floor.
Travis: Wawawa? Wawawawa.
Griffin: You hear Dani shout for Duck.
Dani: Duck, phone!
Aubrey: We'll cover the goat man? We'll hang out with the goat man. With Billy.
Griffin: He has a name.
Aubrey: Yes, with Billy.
Clint: I have an idea. Could Ned check out Thacker's archives and see if there's anything in them about goat men?
Griffin: There's really just the one book, but if you wanna do that, you are more than welcome.
Clint: I think I would be interested in doing that, ‘cause I thought maybe I could also do, like, Investigate a Mystery and see if Ned could get a couple questions answered that way, by checking out the archive?
Griffin: Sure, so you're gonna do that. Aubrey, you're just keeping an eye on Billy?
Travis: Yeah, I'm gonna talk— I'm gonna keep up with the gentle interrogation.
Griffin: Okay, Duck, are you going up to the phone?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Mmkay. Uh, okay, let's start with Aubrey. What do you ask Billy?
Aubrey: Huh. So there are three of you, right?
Griffin: He nods his head yes.
Aubrey: And you're from Sylvain?
Griffin: He cocks his head to the side. He looks kind of confused.
Aubrey: You're not from Sylvain.
Billy: Duck.
Aubrey: Is that a yes?
Griffin: He shakes his head no.
Aubrey: Okay?
Justin: [Laughing] So he can shake his head no and say Duck. If only there was another nod that could communicate more information. Any head movement at all.
Clint: This is some real “I am Groot” shit going on here.
Griffin: Very much so. Uh, Ned, the only sort of surviving text, the only one that Mama brought back when she was over, uh, trapped on the dark side in Sylvain, is just a single book. And it was the book that kind of revealed, like, the only information that we knew was in that book is that he couldn't find the source of the abominations while out exploring in Sylvain. But as you flip through it, why don't you Investigate a Mystery and we'll see.
Clint: M'kay.
Griffin: We'll see what we glean.
Clint: Investigate a Mystery. That is a 7, plus 2 for sharp. So that's a 9.
Griffin: Uh, a 9. Okay. So on a 7 to 9, y—
Clint: I get how many?
Griffin: You get one question here: what happened here, what sort of creature is it, what can it do, what can hurt it, where did it go, what was it going to do, what is being concealed here. And keep in mind that it has to be in context with, like, what could be in this book of notes from Thacker.
Clint: Then I think the only one that would be in there would be “what sort of creature is it.”
Griffin: Yeah, I think that's for sure. Uh, there is a— the first, like, third of the book is just sort of drawings and notes on the physiology of certain types of beings over in Sylvain. There are some notes about the spectral beings that are over there, which you know are born when one of the Sylvans dies in the presence of the crystal in the center of town; they get to live on in these sort of spectral forms. There are some notes about what are just called “Sylvans” that are the more vampiric, more humanoid, sort of magically imbued beings over there. Folks like Dani, and like Janelle.
And then there are notes about the beast-folk, and these are creatures that, according to the notes, just used to be animals over on Earth, and then found their way into the various gates that opened up across the world throughout the history of time, and as they spent time in Sylvain, in this alien world, they were slowly— actually, not slowly. Compared to evolution on Earth, actually very, very quickly, transformed into these new forms. The origin of goatmen is like, a goat wandered through a portal one day, and then maybe a couple of generations later is a bipedal, sort of humanoid goat creature.
But it's not just goat creatures. Like, there's entries on bear-folk and fish-folk and bird-folk, and all kinds of beast-folk. And so, like, goat people are definitely a type of being over in Sylvain, and by all measure, this thing looks a lot like it. Not exactly like— you've met Vincent. It's certainly a bit bigger than Vincent, a bit more imposing than Vincent, you would say. There are some subtle differences, but yeah, this thing looks a lot like Vincent.
Uh, Duck, you head upstairs to answer the phone. I think Barclay heads back up to the lobby with you. And as you get to the lobby, you see some of the folks that you know from the lodge. Up there you see Jake Cool-Ice polishing a board. You see Agent Stern reading a Lamplighter. This is sort of, like, something he does every morning, is he cracks open the new Lamplighter and looks for leads. And Dani hands you the phone as you come up, and as you put it to your ear, you hear a voice say,
Indrid: Hello there. Nice work with the train, Duck. Zero fatalities; I think that's pretty laudable.
Duck: Hey, thanks. I appreciate it. We do what we can.
Griffin: You hear Indrid say,
Indrid: I thought you would like to know that all of my visions have changed, Duck. Every single one of them. In the blink of an eye, all of the futures that I saw disappeared and were replaced by others, and as far as I can tell, Duck, this happened when you saved that goatman.
Duck: Oh. My impulse is to say I'm sorry? I don't know if that's… applicable.
Griffin: He laughs on the other end of the phone, and you hear him say,
Indrid: I'm not certain it was all bad. This goatman is going to be in a lot of the futures that I see. He is, as far as I can tell, quite important.
Duck: A beloved character.
Griffin: He says,
Indrid: You are going to need to keep him safe, and you're going to need to keep him undiscovered, and you're going to need my help to do so. Bring him to me.
Duck: Are— are you gonna hurt him? 'Cause I'm kinda put a lotta work into keeping him alive.
Indrid: I have no intent on hurting him. Um, although, he may get hurt… yes. Uh… yyyyyyeah, you're going to go ahead and need to save him and your friends downstairs. Look outside.
Griffin: And through the window next to the table where the phone is, you see these big fat fluffy flakes falling from the sky. And Indrid says,
Indrid: I can't see the exact shape of it, Duck. It's pretty dark, but they are in danger right now.
Griffin: And sure enough, Ned and Aubrey, you hear a sound that sounds like a— well, like a pin drop. Like a small piece of metal falling to the floor. And you all turn towards the sound and see that the net that was hanging up over the kitchen area, where Thacker has been sort of imprisoned, one of the hooks holding it up has just fallen out of the wall, and now a corner of the net is just hanging loose. And in a flash, Thacker, who was just sitting on the floor, looking down at the ground, almost unconscious— he just springs straight upward and scrambles across the ceiling, through that gap in the net. He is crawling above you, towards you, and he cranes his neck almost completely around, and you see his face that was just calm a moment ago. Now it's just, like, slobbering black slime into this long, unkempt beard and grinning this abnormally wide grin. He is crawling across the ceiling towards you. What do you do?
Justin: I'm probably already back down there.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I mean, in the time— as soon as he said that, I would've come down there, I think.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, you are— I'll give you, like, you are on the stairs as you see Thacker on the ceiling. He quickly cranes his almost backwards head toward you, and then looks back down at Ned and Aubrey, and just, like, hisses.
Clint: Ned makes a beeline with the book into the safe room.
Griffin: Okay! All right. I don't even think you need to roll for that, if that's wha— if that's your plan, then go for it. You grab the book, you head to the safe room. Are you shutting the door?
Clint: [stammering] Well. As he's, as Ned's running, um— and him taking the book is not necessarily a conscious move. It's just that he has it with him. He's not doing any of this to protect the book or anything. He's doing it to protect himself. [Griffin: Okay.] But he calls back over his shoulder and says,
Ned: Last one to the safe room is a rotten egg!
Clint: And…
Griffin: Uh, okay! [Clint: Takes off.] You run into the safe room. This is very Ned. This is peak Ned. This is the aesthetic ideal of Ned Chicane, and I'm very, very into it. Aubrey or Duck, what do you do?
Travis: I'm going to say,
Aubrey: Billy, don't hurt him! I think. Right?
Griffin: Billy doesn't even look concerned. Like, Billy doesn't know that's not what a human being is supposed to look like. Uh, or rather that that's not what a human being is supposed to look like. So he just kinda nods and says,
Billy: Pizza.
Aubrey: Okay, cool. Go— follow Ned!
Griffin: He very quickly sort of canters over to the safe room.
Ned: Here, Billy! Here, Billy! Come on, Billy!
Griffin: He has some trouble fitting into the— well, fitting in, you know, in general. He's a big goatman, but he also has trouble fitting into the safe room.
Travis: Oh, but not just, like, socially.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Clint: Well, his language skills kinda hold him back a little bit.
Griffin: Sure. Uh, Duck, what do you do?
Justin: Um… I'm probably gonna tackle Thacker and try to bring him down.
Griffin: He is up on the ceiling.
Justin: Yeah, I'm gonna, like—
Griffin: Which, like, it's a cellar, so it's totally, like, not a very high ceiling.
Justin: Right.
Griffin: But “tackle” might not be the right verb, because you'd have—
Justin: Not tackle. Y'know, not punch him in the face, but try to like, get 'im on down.
Griffin: Tear him— ge'em down.
Travis: As one might do when trying to catch a bat flying around the room.
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: Get on down from there.
Griffin: There's a move, actually, in the playbook called “Ge'em On Down,” and it's G-E, apostrophe, E-M, on down.
Justin: Ge'em on down from there.
Travis: Ge'em on down.
Griffin: So this would probably— are you trying to, like, do harm?
Justin: It's probably Kick Some Ass?
Griffin: Yeah, that's what I'm—
Justin: I'm not trying to do harm, I guess, though. It's more like— it may be closer to Act Under Pressure, 'cause I'm just trying to get him and restrain him. I'm not trying to beat him up.
Griffin: I think it's definitely Act Under Pressure. I definitely— if you're not trying to hurt him, then it's not Kick Some Ass, right? [Justin: Right.] When you get in— Kick Some Ass literally says, “When you get into a fight and kick some ass, roll plus tough.” You're not getting into a fight, although it definitely— you can sense ill intent.
Justin: It could become a fight.
Griffin: It could definitely become a fight very quickly. You sense that this thing wants to hurt everybody in the room very, very badly. [crosstalk] Um, but it's not right now.
Justin: I'm currently doing, like, friend grabbing his drunk friend and trying to pull him off before an actual fight can occur. That is my to-be verb, currently.
Griffin: Okay. What do you, uh… so you're just running and ge'em on down, trying to just grab him off the ceiling. Go ahead and roll plus cool for Act Under Pressure. How cool is Duck?
Justin: So cool. [pause] Oh, you're wanting me to numerically quantify. It's a 2. Plus.
Griffin: That is cool.
Justin: Oh, an unrecognized command. What'd I do wrong? Oh. “Roll… roll two d…” Uh, 6 plus 2, it's 8.
Griffin: Okay. On a 7 to 9, the Keeper is going to give you a worse outcome, hard choice, or price to pay. Um, hm. I think I might just do price to pay. You grab him, you just sorta wrap your arms around his waist as he is hanging off the ceiling, and pull him down. And as he does, uh, his fingernails have grown sort of long and gruesome. They have this same kind of black plaque that is on various parts of his body, just this sort of tar-like substance that is all over him and dripping from his mouth right now. He scratches you pretty hard across the neck. And that scratch feels like, it feels awful. It feels very, very bad. Not in a, like, you've been gored kind of way, but in an unnatural, like, it's— it burns. So take one harm, ignore armor, from this scratch.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Ned, Aubrey?
Travis: I'm gonna look in my laboratory. So one of the parts of Big Magic is to require ingredients.
Griffin: Yeah…
Travis: I'm gonna look for, like, a potion in the laboratory, so I think it would be probably an Act Under Pressure… and then also maybe a Use Magic roll. I want him to go to sleep.
Griffin: Okay, yeah, I think this would be— we can say that this conflict is happening, like, he jumped down on you inside the laboratory, so this is you literally, like, you're back up against a cabinet, reaching for whatever the fuck you can get your hands on to throw at this thing.
Travis: He's, like, on Duck.
Griffin: He's, like, on Duck right now.
Travis: And so, like, I throw the— so I think it would be, maybe it's an Act Under Pressure to find the right bottle, and then an Act Under Pressure to aim and not hit Duck.
Griffin: I don't like the idea of doing two rolls in a row. I wanna definitely just do it with one. [Travis: Okay.] Is the— I mean, let's, uh… let's make this fair. Is that, uh, is this reasonable? Is this logical? Like, is your magical labr— have you been doing fuckin' Snape's potion class homework in your laboratory, making—
Travis: For, like, tranquilizers.
Griffin: Yeah, is that really what you've been doing in here? Or…
Travis: I would say that I can make a strong argument for the fact that, with all of the abominations and stuff, one of the first things we'd be working on is, like, tranqs. Right? Like, that, to me, seems—
Griffin: Yeah, but then I would have to give you that, right? And then you could use tranqs on any— you know what I mean? That's just sort of adding an arrow in your quiver.
Justin: I think that that at least gives you the possibility of the action. Whether or not he is successful in that… [Griffin: That's it!] is a different question. But you do have the narrative framing for, logistically, why he wouldn't just be randomly grabbing bottles.
Griffin: What I love this way, the roll is not for you to throw a bottle at this guy; you're right up against him, you can do it. It is whatever the contents of the bottle are gonna be. Maybe you have been trying to alchemize some sort of potion or toxin or something that can help you in your hunts. It is not final. You have not, you know—
Travis: Has not been tested.
Griffin: Has not been beta tested. So you can roll Act Under Pressure, and that is going to determine what this thing does.
Travis: Let's do it.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Okay, Ned is gonna do Help Out.
Travis: Ooh…
Griffin: You are in the safe room.
Clint: Door's open.
Travis: Okay, I rolled a 7.
Griffin: Plus?
Travis: And I don't have any plus. So, mixed success.
Griffin: Help Out would not help out 'cause that only adds one to the roll, which would get them to 8. Mixed success is fine. Um… okay, here is the— now I'm trying to figure out, like— I don't think I can offer you a hard choice on what the contents of the potion is. I think you already kind of rolled the hard 6 on this, and it's kinda up to me to decide what happens. Uh, he— what's the potion look like? You actually describe the action to me.
Travis: I'm going to say, like, grabs the— starts to reach for the purple vial, but then reaches for the more purple vial, and can't remember— ""Shit!"" And grabs the more purple vial and kinda flings it at their feet, and it spreads into a gas.
Griffin: Okay. It gets scared, actually, Thacker gets scared as you throw this bottle, and he recoils. And he recoils right into the gas. And the gas very, very quickly dissipates, and for, like, a second, he looks like he's getting kind of sleepy. But he also looks like he is, uh, in an effort to try to stay conscious, getting angrier. Now his eyes are completely pitch black, like he's wearing those cool pitch black eye contacts that, like, you know, bassists wore in the early aughts for all their cool music videos. And he looks like he is actually whipped into a frenzy. So, the mixed success there is—
Travis: Aubrey real quick just grabs a clipboard where she's been keeping notes and writes “C-”.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: “Less purple.”
Travis: “Close.”
Griffin: Duck, I think you are up. This thing is off you now, but looks super pissed off. I keep saying this thing, it is—
Travis: So I did succeed in getting it off of Duck, like, so now it's just, like…
Griffin: You succeeded in that Thacker has been tranquilized, right? Thacker may go down very, very soon, but before he does, he's gonna fuckin' rage.
Travis: He will not go quietly.
Griffin: He will not go quietly into that good night. Duck, what do you do?
Justin: Um,
Duck: Hey, man, I'm real sorry about this.
Justin: And I punch him in the face.
Griffin: Okay. Now this is gonna be a Kick Some Ass.
Justin: Yes, it is. It is, Griffin, it is going to be that. But I also, I'm trying to knock him out. So…
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Give him a little brain duster.
Griffin: [laughs] All right, go ahead and roll that beautiful bean footage.
Justin: I got a…
Griffin: There we go!
Justin: Ooh, there it is! It's a 9 plus… uh, tough. That's 11.
Griffin: All right! On a 10+, you deal harm, and they deal harm to you. You choose an extra effect: you gain the advantage, gain plus one forward or plus one to another hunter, you inflict terrible harm, you suffer less harm, you force them where you want them.
Justin: Heh. I'm gonna toss him into the safe room.
Clint: Yikes!
Griffin: With Ned and the goatman?
Justin: Yeah. And I'm gonna yell,
Duck: Y'all get outta there!
Griffin: I'm trying to think of— I'm trying to figure out what's gonna be best here. You definitely punch him, and he is [Travis: Dazed.] loopy, but I don't know that you can just, like… chuck him, like a ball. But you can definitely toss him in the direction of the safe room, and then I guess it's up to Ned and, uh, Billy to get outta there. To ge'on outta there.
Clint: Ge'on out?
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Ge'em down, ge'on out.
Griffin: You just, like, I guess grab him by the scruff of the sort of tattered garments he's wearing, and push him towards the safe room. Ned, what do you— what's your plan?
Clint: Okay. Um, we gotta get past him. He's sort of in the safe room with us, right?
Griffin: Uh, yeah, he is definitely between you and the exit to the safe room.
Clint: Okay. I put an arm around Billy and kinda pull him in to my side. And then I fan open Thacker's archive.
Griffin: Okay…
Clint: And hold it in front of Billy.
Griffin: Okay…
Clint: And I tell Thacker,
Ned: Stand down…
Clint: And we're slowly backing out, as I'm saying this.
Griffin: Okay.
Ned: Or I'm gonna have the goat eat your book.
Clint: And just sloooowly back— using the book as a hostage [Griffin: Okay.] back out of the safe room. Hopefully that Thacker, on some level, will recognize [Griffin: Sure.] his book and not want harm to come to it, whether he understands my threat to have Billy eat it…
Griffin: Absolutely. No, I like this. So the— I mean, you're going to roll here, and the roll is not to, like— it's gonna be Manipulate Someone, right? But it's not going to be, like, how good an offer is this to Thacker. It is how much of Thacker can you pull to the surface [Clint: Right.] of this, like, feral beast. Go ahead and roll Manipulate Someone, plus charm.
Clint: 10, plus 1, which is 11. Whoo!
Griffin: Bazinga.
Justin: Wow.
Griffin: Something interesting—
Justin: Bazinga, indeed.
Griffin: Something cool happens. You pull this gambit, and put your back up against one of the side walls, trying to sidestep past Thacker. And for, like, a split second, Thacker stands upright. And it is not like, “The curse has been lifted, hooray!” but for, like, a second, definitely that black sheen that was across his eyes is just gone, and he has stopped just wildly slobbering, and is now just kind of breathing deeply, and puts his back against the wall, and you very— you're very close to him, right? Like, as you sidestep out of the room, you are [Clint: Yeah.] really, really close to him, but he doesn't attack. He keeps his distance. And as you step out of the room, what do you do?
Travis: And Aubrey slams the door.
Griffin: Okay! Right as Ned and Billy clear the door, you slam it. And as soon as the door slams, this spell that was cast over Thacker fades, and he just charges the door. I'm envisioning kind of a little circular glass, like, brain duster. window— or maybe not. I don't know. Duck, you envisioned this room. Is there a window on the door inside?
Travis: This is Ned's room.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Is it?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Oh, yeah, that's right, you had the in-fur-mary. Ned, is there a window?
Clint: There's a TV monitor.
Griffin: Okay. Oh, I like that. It's very— very high-tech, I like that.
Clint: You can look in there and see him break all Ned's Hummel figurines, or whatever he's got still in there.
[laughing]
Travis: All of his bobbleheads.
Clint: All of his—
Griffin: Yeah, he is—
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: He slams against the door. He just charges and throws his whole body at the door a few times, and nothing happens, and then he just does the same thing that you've seen from Thacker this whole time. He just sits down on the floor and starts staring at the ground.
Clint: Saving the bobbleheads.
Travis: Well, your snowglobes made it.
Clint: Aww!
Travis: The bobbleheads may never bobble again.
Clint: As long as he didn't get the PlayStation.
Travis: Bad news, Dad.
Clint: Aww.
Justin: Aw, your PlayStation 2. Shattered.
Travis: PlayStation 2. You'll never be able to play, I don't know, Crash Bandicoot? Was that on PlayStation 2?
Justin: You'll never finish Blasto. On your PlayStation 2.
Griffin: That's a very good pull. God, can our next campaign be Blasto-inspired?
Justin: Yes.
{ad break 34:39 - 39:59}
Griffin: We're getting Dad into Destiny.
Justin: Yes.
Griffin: It's gonna go great.
Travis: Speaking of, Ditto, how come you're never on when I'm on? When do you play?
Griffin: I play late at night.
Justin: Like a creepy creep.
[laughing]
Justin: [singing, sort of] When you look in the shadows, there I'll be, playing a little bit of Destiny. I got all of the coins, I got all of the jewels, but you'll never see me, you pesky fools. I'm hiding out, don't you scream and shout. I hold my controller, look, here comes a roller. That's what I call the bad guys in this game, and if you see me, it'll be a shame!
Griffin: All right, so we're back, we're in act 2 of this episode. That was definitely how we started it. You heard us talk about Destiny for a while, which is regrettable, but then you got to hear Justin's great song, so I think it's all sort of a neutral, net sum game.
Travis: And just like that, we're taking the show in a different direction. It's gonna be much more about freestyle.
Griffin: First half is all storytelling. The second half is all freestyle singing game reviews. We've just missed being in the games industry so much. Okay, we're back at it. Um, let's— if it's cool with you all, unless you had business you wanted to do at Amnesty Lodge, I wanted to hop forward to your encounter at Indrid's. He has requested that you bring the goatman to him so he can help you keep him safe.
Travis: I wanna assume, just to say it, that we have, like, had Barclay, like, “Hey, go tell Mama,” [Griffin: Well, how muh—] like, that he broke out, we trapped him in the safe room, but he needs to be moved back into there… and he should be tranq’d at this point, right, once he's calmed down.
Clint: You're talking about Thacker.
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: Yeah, Mama definitely was not home during all of this encounter. Um, and Barclay, I mean, before we hop forward, I guess, we're still in that first scene. Barclay says, like,
Barclay: Are we gonna tell Mama about… about old Billy?
Travis: See, here's the thing. This is a fun moment, people at home listening, because me, Travis, hates when people in any kind of media just don't tell the people on their team the truth, 'cause it always is more trouble than it's worth. [Justin: Yes.] But I also know that in this position, I definitely wouldn't tell an authority figure what was happening.
Griffin: Sure. Like, just to sort of set the stakes of this decision up, I don't think any of you necessarily know how Mama would react to this news. You do know that Mama has been hunting monsters like Billy, or rather, beings like Billy, I guess, for 30 years now, and has lost a lot of friends to them, and lost her adult life doing anything else but hunting them. So, like, she might not be stoked about the fact that you let one into her, her home. That's your gut feeling, and I'm not saying that you absolutely shouldn't I'm just saying that that's sort of the weight of this decision.
Justin: Hmm.
Travis: Were we all just simultaneously waiting for the other ones to make a decision?
Ned: I say we don't tell her.
Aubrey: Yeah, I'm gonna go with that, too. At least not… yet.
Duck: I hate that, but I think y’all are right.
Ned: I do, too.
Aubrey: I mean, yeah, I hate it too, but…
Ned: They do it on Arrow all the time. All the time.
Duck: That's true, they do do it on Arrow all the time.
Aubrey: They do, yeah. They do do it on Arrow, you're right, Ned.
Travis: How come we haven't all talked about our Arrow fandom yet? Like…
Griffin: Yeah, in the fiction of this show, Arrow is the biggest, most popular show in the whole world.
Travis: And I assume every… Thursday? I don't know when it airs. Ned and—
Justin: [dramatic voice] In a dystopian future, Arrow has become something of a religion.
Griffin: Arrow is truth. Freedom is Arrow.
Justin: Kill The Flash!
Travis: We are Arrow.
Griffin: Two plus two equals arrow.
Justin: The afterlife is divided into heaven and the speed force.
[laughing]
Griffin: Okay, Barclay kinda, like, shuffles his feet and looks down for a second. He says,
Barclay: She has been more… mm, driven than usual since she got back from her time in Sylvain. I think that's the right call. Um, I'll do my best. I don't really know how long we'll be able to hide him down here, though, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, I guess.
Ned: Well, we're taking him with us, so… so that's off the plate. You don't have to worry about him being here. And as someone who's always honest with everyone in his life, I think it makes me uncomfortable.
Barclay: Where are you taking him?
Aubrey: We're gonna go patrol and see if we can get some more answers out of him by showing him around, right, Ned?
Ned: Abso-fucking-lutely.
Griffin: [laughs] Okay. And then just jump cut to you all standing in front of Indrid's Winnebago.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: In the Eastwood RV Park.
Justin: On your second listen to this program, just imagine Duck standing completely motionless and silent throughout all of that lying. Just, like, it was like, “Duck, are you… is there something wrong with the lamp? 'Cause you're just staring at that lamp and not doing anything else. Like, are you okay?”
Griffin: Um, so it's mid-afternoon. The RV park is still, like, completely abandoned except for Indrid's Winnebago at the backlot of the park. It's getting, like, I think mid to late December at this point, and it's getting very cold outside, like, painfully cold. It's still not snowing, at least not naturally snowing, but it's, y'know, in the 20's, and you feel it on your face. It is very, very cold. And Indrid opens the door to his trailer, and you feel that blast of heat from inside, from the several, uh… um… oh, shit, what are those things called? Hot…
Travis: Space heaters?
Griffin: Hot makers.
Clint: Space heaters.
Travis: Space heaters, Griffin.
Griffin: Space heaters, yes. And the goat— Billy kind of recoils at the blast of heat, kinda catches him by surprise, and Indrid says—
Travis: Also, just to fill out the world here a little bit [Griffin: Please.] to help get Billy around the world, I think that we've maybe gotten a big, like, vampire cape from Ned's, from the Cryptonomica, as part of the Halloween movie show that he does. And so we put this, like, vampire, hooded cloak on him, and maybe some kind of mask? Maybe, like, y'know, I don't know, what— maybe, like—
Griffin: The mask is a Krampus mask, so it's kind of just, like—
Travis: Yeah.
Clint: 'Cause we're promoting the upcoming Krampus festival on Saturday Night Dead.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I like that, okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] Right, right, right.
Griffin: Then, in Barclay's truck— or rather, Mama's truck— you definitely pass a car with Billy in the backseat, and they see Billy dressed up as the Krampus, and they look really scared for a second, and then they remember, “Oh, right, this is Ned's show,” and they wave at you, Ned. Uh, and now we're back.
Travis: And Billy waves back.
Griffin: And now we're back in the RV park.
Travis: I think, as time has gone on, we have made Billy more and more like Harry from Harry and the Hendersons.
Griffin: Yeah, I figured that would take maybe a quarter of an episode, and I was right. Um, he, Indrid motions you all inside, and he says,
Indrid: Hurry inside. You won't be able to prevent the deaths of the innocent masses if you all catch a cold.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Okay, well, pressure.
Griffin: [crosstalk] And he motions you into his Winnie.
Aubrey: Billy, Indrid. Indrid, Billy.
Griffin: He smiles, and he says,
Indrid: I know about Billy. I know about pretty much everything as soon as it happens, Aubrey.
Griffin: And he says,
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Okay, but that doesn't mean—
Indrid: [crosstalk] Sorry, no, that sounded douchey. I'm really sorry. I forget [Aubrey: Yeah.] sometimes that that can come off that way.
Aubrey: Come on, man, manners. You know?
Indrid: Sure.
Aubrey: Like… it's the only thing that separates us from the beasts. No offense, Billy.
Griffin: He lets you all inside, and as you all sort of shed your heavy winter wear in this very, very sort of sticky, hot environment, he goes to the fridge, and he says,
Indrid: Could I warm you up with a cup of hot nog?
Aubrey: Pretty hot already. Um, fairly warm. I think we're good.
Griffin: He offers hot nog to you, Ned and Duck.
Indrid: Any takers?
Duck: Do you think—
Ned: Mm…
Duck: Do I want nog? [pause] I mean—
Indrid: I don't know— what?
Duck: You should know if I'm gonna have nog or not.
Indrid: Okay, fine. Hold on, wait. Yeah, no nog. No nogs all around.
Duck: Wrong, I love nog.
Indrid: Oh, you've changed the timeline.
Duck: Aw, no, I destroyed Earth!
Griffin: He pours you a nog and hands it to you, and he says,
Indrid: It's funny, Duck, that is actually a great example of what's been going on lately. Before we get to business—
Ned: Yes, I'll have a nog.
Indrid: Oh. Okay.
Griffin: Uh, he pours you a nog.
Indrid: Aubrey, it seems like everyone's having— everyone's [Aubrey: No!] nogging out, are you— okay.
Aubrey: No, thank you.
Griffin: He puts the— he offers Billy a nog, and Billy definitely takes the nog. But Billy doesn't know what to do with it. Billy, I think try— pours it on his hands and starts washing his hands in the sink with the nog.
Travis: Hold on. Billy's definitely consumed a beverage before, right, Griffin? Like…
Clint: He could lap at it. Y'know, like a cat?
Griffin: I mean, hey, it doesn't seem like it. It certainly doesn't seem like it.
Clint: A clue…
Travis: So Billy just sprung fully formed onto this Earth this morning?
Griffin: I mean, you tell me. You don't know— there are still many things you don't know about Billy. But he's poured nog on his hands, and he's washing his hands with it. And watching this with just immeasurable amusement, Indrid says,
Indrid: There are new futures. Aubrey and Ned, I've already told Duck about this, but there are new futures that were all born the moment that you saved this fascinating creature. I see him present in several timelines, absent in some others, but it seems like you will all need to keep him close until his true purpose is divined. But obviously you can't have a large goatman wandering around with you, despite how clever a costume you've whipped up for him, Ned. I was spooked. I have not personally met the Krampus myself, but I thought maybe he had come to visit me with his wintertime malice.
Aubrey: Can I just say… listen, you've been, uh, helpful and all, but… can we, like, cut through some mystery bullshit [Duck: Thank you.] and could you just, like, answer this question directly. [Duck: Just one question.] Snow falls, right, and bad shit happens. But, like, Billy's not— it doesn't seem like Billy's making bad fates happen. What the fuck is going on?
Griffin: Hmm. I'm trying to decide what he would be able to tell you about this, but you've basically asked me, Griffin, the Keeper, to solve the entire mystery of this arc for you in one question, which definitely isn't going to happen.
Travis: But there has to be something he can tell us beyond vague, like, “There's things in the future, and if you—” Like, okay, cool. So, like…
Griffin: That's fair. He'll definitely firm things up. Okay. He sets down his nog, and the amusement that was on his face as he watched Billy fuck up is kind of gone now.
Travis: Which also, can I just say, is very, like… he knew Billy was gonna pour it on his hands and wash his hands with it. Indrid. You jerk.
Griffin: Indrid, just to clear things up, like, as he explained in the last episode, it's not like he is living constantly 15 seconds ahead of you. He sees lots of different possible futures. Not all of them, but lots of possible ones, so, like [Travis: Uh-huh.] the way he described it, it's like watching, what, like 120 television shows all at the same time and trying to keep track of what's— it's hard to do that, so I think he boasts, but I don't think he knows everything. Um, so he looks serious for a moment, and he says,
Indrid: I think it's probably time that we took stock of what we know about the thing that's changing the future.
Griffin: He says,
Indrid: While I'm doing that…
Griffin: And he walks over to this small wooden chest at the foot of his bed, and he opens it. And inside are a bunch of garments, like, loose articles of clothing, a lot of accessories, like watches and bracelets, and you also see just some junk in there, just a random assortment of items. And he says,
Indrid: Billy, why don't you root through here and find something that speaks to you, and I'll whip you up a charm that will give you a human-like disguise that you can use to navigate the world.
Griffin: And he gestures Billy over to this chest, and he starts rooting around. And he says,
Indrid: That was the main purpose of this visit. Hopefully, with that, you all will be able to walk around with Billy in public without him having to dress up as the Krampus. I imagine after Christmas, that disguise isn't going to make much sense anymore. You can't have an April Krampus. April Krampus brings May schrampus.
Ned: You know what really might lend itself to that, um, would be… we can disguise a lot of him. We can disguise his body and put a hat on him, but it's those goat eyes. The goat— would you happen to have a spare pair of your spectacles, your sunglasses that you wear, those tinted glasses? Would you have an extra pair of those that perhaps Billy could wear that would obviously disguise his goat-ish eyes?
Travis: Aubrey mentally high-fives Ned.
Indrid: Um, I mean, if that's what Billy picks. If that's what Billy thinks fits his persona…
Ned: Billy pretty much listens to me, uh, we're [laughs] we're pretty much… maybe he could just, y'know, try it out and see if it works.
Aubrey: Can we get back to the part where you were gonna answer me?
Indrid: Yes, of course, sorry. Um, so. Something is changing events at specific places, to specific people, and placing them on disastrous paths. The fact that you were all just targeted, just now, moments ago, is, in a way, a boon. It means that these accidents aren't random. They are happening with intent. You were getting closer in your investigation to what is causing these accidents. You turned one of the enemy to your side. You had to be stopped. You were targeted.
Duck: Mm-hm.
Indrid: That means that there is a motive behind these attacks. If we can learn what the motive is, we can learn about who is perpetrating them.
Aubrey: Wait, hold on. So Billy and his two friends, they're not actually doing this, right? Like, they're not the ones changing the timeline?
Indrid: You have spent more time with your new friend than I have. Does he seem capable of changing… time?
Duck: Honestly, he just seems like a real smart goat.
Aubrey: Wait, wait, wait. What if the— what if Billy and the other two, they're just, like, the footsoldiers. I don't… maybe they work for whatever is changing the timeline?
Indrid: That could be possible. Let's break things down. Let's go event by event. The first accident, um, your friend… uh… Dan… ? Rick… Rick Dannon.
Ned: Danimal.
Duck: The Danimal. [crosstalk] The Danimal.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Danimal.
Indrid: The… the Danimal. Yes, I, um…
Duck: You say it in a way that makes me so angry.
Aubrey: You say it like it's a joke.
Duck: You say it like it's spoiled in your mouth and turned to ash. Just call him Rick Dannon then, if you're gonna be like that. Shit.
Indrid: No—
Aubrey: Or just, like Richard.
Duck: Richard is fine. [crosstalk] Mr. Dannon.
Indrid: [crosstalk] No, I can hang— I can hang. Danimal.
Duck: That's better, honestly. I will give it up to you for trying. Thank you for that.
Indrid: Objects were taken from… Danimal's truck, [Aubrey: Yes.] the tools of his trade. Leo's General Store, the Pizza Hut sign fell into it. What could be the cause of that? Why was the funicular attacked? We know why you were attacked, because you're getting close to solving the mystery. Something happened at the general store that furthered their purpose. Something happened at the funicular that furthered their purpose.
Aubrey: Here's what I don't understand, because it’s— like, I almost wanna connect it, that the Danimal was an employee of the park service, and then at the funicular, your friend was there, and she's an employee of the park service, but what does that have to do with the general store?
Duck: There was somebody else at the general store who we didn't identify, I remember that.
Griffin: He was nobody! I'm sorry I included an NPC that I didn't even come up with a fucking name for! He is not the secret Voldemort of this campaign! He die— I'm erasing, no, I'm Thanos-ing him from the timeline. There was nobody in the bathroom. Shazam!
Clint: Snap your fingers.
Duck: There's a voice in my head that says that guy wasn't important.
Aubrey: Yeah, I feel that too.
Duck: You feel that too, but then there's this other voice in my head that's like, it all turns on that guy.
Aubrey: Yeah, we can't trust that person.
Duck: Or gal or nonbinary individual, I don't know. There are so many unanswered questions about this person.
Aubrey: We should spend three episodes investigating this person.
Duck: That's it. Miniseries, I love it.
Indrid: Was anything taken from the general store?
Duck: That's a good question. I'm gonna go back there and look.
Ned: We didn't ask.
Justin: And then several hours later…
Travis: Yeah, jump cut!
Justin: Jump cut, and we're back. I looked, and then I came back. With editing.
Griffin: Okay. No. Uh, he says,
Indrid: There are some mysteries, but has your new friend told you anything?
Aubrey: He said, “grow”? They're growing something?
Duck: Yeah, you know what, one thing that was missing was some tools, some gardening tools. They stole some of those from the Danimal.
Ned: Yeah, and he said that they— he told us in his own weird way that they took those tools to help something grow.
Indrid: Then it seems like that might be the culprit for what is changing the future.
Griffin: And I think you all are sort of caught up in trying to summarize this mystery, that you don't see Billy sort of standing now, sort of filling up the entire frame, the entire door frame into Indrid's bedroom, where he has gone and he has pulled out a… watch, a nice, big, sort of metal band watch with a metal face on it. It is not operating. It is not ticking, but he has it, and maybe he just picked it because it was shiny and nice, but he bleats a few times and hands it to Indrid. And Indrid says,
Indrid: Oh, thank you, friend.
Griffin: And he places it on a table. He, like, swipes some hot pocket wrappers off the table, and starts sort of tinkering with it. And you see, like, little flashes of light as he tinkers with it. And he says,
Indrid: So… I will be honest with you, I am not much help right now. There are so many different ways that this can end up. Some are disastrous. Some are triumphant. And I don't know which way it's going to go, but… what do you all think the next step is?
Aubrey: That's gonna be up to Billy here. 'Cause if he's been making something grow, I wonder if he'd take us— Billy, will you take us to what you've been growing?
Griffin: Billy looks kind of… nervous. Um, and I don't know, I think you will have to roll a Manipulate Someone if you want him to do it, which means you'll have to give him a reason, a reason to do it. But right now, he just shakes his head. He shakes his head no, without any kind of effort. He just shakes his head no. He is, like, adamant, no way.
Duck: Hey, Billy. Lemme try. It's me, your pal Duck. Remember how you almost beefed it, and then I was like, “not on my watch,” and I threw you over my shoulder, and I spent several hours bringing you back from the brink of death? Just say “Duck” if you remember.
Billy: Duck.
Duck: Thank you. Well, listen. I didn't ask anything in return. In fact, you kinda tried to kill me. Which is fine, I get it. But I'm asking you for this. You do this, and we're square. You no longer have, I don't know if your people have any sort of life debt you have to pledge me until the debts are paid or anything, but you do this, you help me out, we're square.
Griffin: Uh, he sort of nervously nods, and he just kind of stands there. He looks very, like, again, he looks super conflicted. You get the sense that he is sort of weighing his loyalties right now and trying to figure out where exactly they land. And you hear, you see one last sort of bright flash as Indrid waves his hands over this watch on the table, and he walks over and hands it to Billy. And he says,
Indrid: I hope you like what I whipped up for you.
Griffin: And Billy takes the watch, and he puts it in his mouth. 'Cause he's a goat.
Aubrey: Billy…
Griffin: And he says,
Billy: Pizza?
Aubrey: [patronizing] No, Billy, not pizza!
Duck: It's a watch, Billy!
Aubrey: Put it on your wrist!
Griffin: He spits it out, and it lands in his hand, and he says,
Billy: Duck?
Griffin: And he kinda, like, holds it, he offers it to you, Duck, like he's giving it to you.
Duck: No, listen, I don't need that. I appreciate it. Here, let me help.
Justin: I take it out of his mouth, and I slip it onto his wrist. Or his, like— not wrist… fore—
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Forehand? [laughing] His wrist, okay.
Clint: Wouldn't he have hooves instead of hands?
Travis: No, he's got hooves on the bottom. [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay, I slip it on his beautiful—
Griffin: Party up top.
Clint: Fetlock.
Griffin: I've just googled goat anatomy. [pause] Oh, no!
Justin: You'll never recover from this!
Griffin: Oh, no!
Justin: Delete your computer!
Griffin: Um, he transforms. Like, instantly. You've seen this when, like— I think you've mostly seen this from Barclay when he has taken the bracelet that he wears off and turned into Bigfoot, and then tossed it back on. And he transforms into a human man. He, uh, I can leave this up to Juice. Like, you basically are the one who brought this character into the campaign. Do you wanna decide what he looks like?
Justin: Uh… yeah. He looks exactly like Ryan Gosling.
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Um…okay, so much so that people are gonna see him on the street and be like, “Ryan Gosling?” and then he'll be like, “Pizza,” [laughing] and they'll be like, “Oh, probably not Ryan Gosling.”
Justin: Hey, Griffin, at what point in that sentence did you realize that it's fucking great? [Griffin laughing] Was it four words in, five words in? Give us the exact word at which my brilliance dawned on you.
Travis: And maybe, Griffin, in this universe, there hasn't been a Ryan Gosling 'til now [Justin: Yes.] and moving forward, Billy will become what we know as Ryan Gosling.
Clint: Half goat—
Travis: And in The Notebook, it'll be like like, “What do you want?” “Pizza.”
Clint: Half goat, half goose. Half goat, half goose.
Griffin: Uh, okay, I'm into it. Uh, sure, he looks…he looks pretty much exactly like Ryan Gosling, there it is. He is a very hand— like, Indrid actually takes a step back, and he's like,
Indrid: Whoa, damn! I guess I… I guess I had your Earth's Ryan Gosling on the old brain when I was whipping that up. Sorry about that. That might end up being a little confusing.
Travis: I love when we just go ahead and cast the Adventure Zone movie for the directors. Like, don't even worry about it. Get me Ryan Gosling, it's canon.
Griffin: Uh, and Ryan Gosling Billy, like, looks at his now-flesh hands, and looks at the nice button-down that he is wearing under a denim jacket, and he's looking at his body, and he just says, um,
Billy: [normal voice] Pizza.
Griffin: No, I think he definitely still sounds like a goat.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: He definitely— says,
Billy: Duck? Duck? Duck?
Travis: Duck, Duck, Gosling, is what we'll call this arc.
Griffin: Yowzers.
Justin: Baa-Baa Land.
[laughing]
Travis: The Goatbook.
Griffin: [laughing] Oh, man, there's so many!
Justin: There's so many excellent things!
Clint: First Goat on the Moon.
Griffin: Uh—
Travis: First Goatman, Dad, sorry.
Justin: First Goatman.
Griffin: Uh, goat—
Travis: Or First Pan. We also would've accepted the First Pan.
Justin: We would've also accepted the First Pan.
Griffin: Goat Drive. Goat— hey, everybody, Goat Drive.
Justin: You're just putting up a bunch of—
Griffin: Only Goat Forgives.
Justin: Blade Eater 2049. Like grass? Like blades of grass?
Travis: I got it!
Justin: Goatster Squad.
Travis: You're s—
Justin: The Big Goat!
[laughing]
Griffin: You're looking at his IMDB page now.
Travis: The Knockaround Goats.
Justin: Knockaround Goats is excellent. That's really excellent.
Griffin: The comedy rule of 39's has now applied, and we are—
Justin: Lars and the Real Goat.
Griffin: Okay.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Justin: [laughing] I'm done.
Travis: It's just that they're all so good.
Griffin: Yeah, I know, but we usually end these episodes on a cliffhanger, but, like—
Justin: Just fade out.
Griffin: Well, we need, like, a last thing to say after it goes like “bong,” so Justin, why don't you just say one last really good one.
Justin: [beat] Crazy Stupid Goat! [laughs]"

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Griffin: You melt the snow in front of Keith and he eats shit. And then he stands up, looks back at you, Aubrey, and is just kind of staring at you dumbfounded.
Duck: We gotta get this thing back to the lodge. I know, I know, I know— but look at it, man, it’s gonna die if we don’t do something. Hell, we got veterinary equipment down there.
Indrid: You were targeted. That means there was a motive behind these attacks.
Aubrey: What if Billy and the other two, they’re just the foot soldiers?
Indrid: Why was the funicular attacked?
Aubrey: Your friend was there and she’s an employee of the park service, what does that have to do with the general store?
Justin: I take it out of his mouth and I slip it onto his wrist.
Griffin: He transforms. Do you wanna decide what he looks like?
Justin: Uhh, yeah, he looks exactly like Ryan Gosling.
Travis: Duck, duck, Gosling is what we’ll call this arc.
Griffin: Yowzers.
Justin: Baaa baaa land.
[laughing]
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Travis: Hey, so everyone at home listening, so Griffin did a shit ton of work in Roll 20, [Griffin: I did.] and input like— it’s gonna change the literal game. But one of the things that he done did was compile all of the things that we should’ve known and written down that we didn’t, maybe Dad did, I don’t know, he’s a nerd, [Clint: I did.] and that’s how— all of these clues in there— and I’ve done figured this whole thing out! I can see it—
Griffin: Oh, did I make it…
Travis: No, I—
Griffin: Did I make it too easy?
Travis: I see it all now, wheels within wheels, I know exactly what’s going on. Also, another behind the scenes that really helped— went back and listened to the last episode.
Griffin: How novel.
Travis: I know! And uh, I’m ready— I’m ready to solve the puzzle, Alex.
Justin: Hey listener, can I— can I suggest that you do that too, if you haven’t been doing that? Go back and and listen to the last— especially when we take a— [Griffin: A calendar month?] a calendar month between releases… go back and make sure you download it separately and please up your donation to reflect that you’re listening multiple times. [Travis: Yeah.]
Griffin: Otherwise it’s thievery and theft.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Justin: [crosstalk] It’s stealing, yeah.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Federal— federal crime.
Travis: I also wanna say, I just said, “I’m ready to solve the puzzle, Alex.” I should’ve said Pat, and I’m really mad at myself.
Justin: No one says that. [laughing]
Travis: They don’t say that?
Justin: No one says— I don’t think it’s a— I don’t think “I’m ready to solve the puzzle, Pat.” I don’t think you may address Pat Sajak by his name anymore, [Griffin: That’s true.] I think he would think that’s threatening.
Travis: Do they just say “Mr. Sajak?”
Clint: “Mr. Sajak,” yeah.
Griffin: No, they just go whole episodes without even acknowledging that he’s fuckin’ there. [Justin laughing] They’re just— they care about the board, they care about their letters and their precious fuckin’ wheel, but Pat Sajak doesn’t get the time of day.
Justin: They say pardon me, wheel lord… [crosstalk, Clint laughing] I’m ready to solve— to solve your riddle [Travis: Now if—] and save my family from the dungeon that you’ve imprisoned them in.
Travis: Is Pat Sajak the wheel lord or is he just like the mouthpiece for the wheel lord?
Justin: Pat Sajak is the lord of the wheel, he imprisons all the contestants’ families before every episode and makes them play to free them.
Travis: But only one person wins, Justin.
Justin: The one thing about it is that— the— the right— there’s two correct answers to every puzzle. It’s what the letters spell and also his true name. [Travis: Ohh.] So if you ever answer his true name—
Griffin: Buuut, you have to get him to say it.
Travis: Hmmmm.
Griffin: It’s tough. It’s a tough game, Wheel of Fortune.
Justin: People have only found so far three of the letters: [“kkkk” static sound], [“ssss” hissing sound], and [“chhk” sound].
[laughing]
Griffin: [laughing] They’re more runes than anything.
Justin: [laughing] They’re sort of— runes.
Travis: And that’s why he’s aged over the time— cause you know, he’s immortable— once you find those letters, it takes about, I don’t know, three years—
Griffin: Did you say “immortable?”
Travis: No—
Clint: He’s immortable, that’s a portable immortal. [Griffin: Ohhkay.] That’s someone who can— can go somewhere and live forever.
Griffin: Alright, we— that’s good, cause we actually got all of our sort of diversions and, like, drifting from the story out of the way like at the top of the show, which is super convenient. Now we can just like, plot plot plot plot plot, bullshit bullshit bullshit.
Travis: So here’s the thing I figured out that I wanna— because I know that this is something we were trying to figure out last episode— Griffin, tell me if I’m right, because you have to— the reason that the general store was attacked was to steal fertilizer.
Griffin: That’s correct.
Travis: Yeeeah.
Clint: Whoooooa, Nelly!
Griffin: I don’t know why I’m just like telling you that, but like, it seems like a— such a—
Travis: Well because we’ve been in this arc for like twenty seven episodes.
Griffin: Well, the bigger thing is that it would’ve been a big clue back— back then, when you, like, first saw it, if you had like investigated that? There’ve been lots of times where, like, you all investigated one thing instead of another thing, so there’s information you didn’t have— but at this point, like, I think that that is largely, uh, you know, what you could probably— I think you probably just figured that out through context clues. I didn’t write down he stole fertilizer, Travis just sort of sussed that out.
Justin: Who stole fertilizer?
Griffin: The— the goatman.
Justin: Why? [Griffin: Yeah—]
Travis: Cause they’re trying to grow something, Justin.
Griffin: So, let’s—
Justin: I know, and I solved that one.
Griffin: This is turning into a The The Adventure Zone Zone, so let’s play the game Monster of the Week. Let’s pick up right after the, uh, great events of the last episode. You have now a Ryan Gosling on your team in the form of Billy, and you are still in Indrid’s Winnebago.
Aubrey: Hey, I think that they were stealing fertilizer from the general store!
Griffin: Indrid looks shocked, because you sort of just said this, like, out of nowhere? It was almost like you were having a conversation with nobody?
Travis: Well, you know, here’s the thing— at this point I think this will surprise no one, but Aubrey has, um, ADD, much like myself.
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: So oftentimes I will have whole conversations in my head that I don’t share with anybody and then just say the conclusion out loud?
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: So I’m gonna say that is what has happened here.
Griffin: Alright, for sure. Uhhh, Indrid says:
Indrid: Well, that would explain why the— Leo’s store was targeted. We still don’t really know why Juno was targeted. But anyways, now that you can sort of take your turncoat friend here about town without fear of looky-loos— I mean, he does look like Ryan Gosling, [Clint: Yeah.] which is going to attract quite a few look-i-looks, but anyway, I’d recommend that you’d get out there.
Aubrey: But why would Ryan Gosling be— I think people will see it and be like no, there’s no way.
Indrid: I mean, maybe he’s doing, umm, sort of, method research for the Land Beyond the Pines 2 I think it was called or whatever.
Ned: And remember, you did agree, Indrid, to let us borrow your special glasses as kind of a disguise for young Billy. I don’t know if you remember a month ago, but you agreed to do that.
Griffin: He kind of smirks and says, uh,
Indrid: So you, um, you wanna borrow my glasses…?
Aubrey: Can I be straight— here’s the deal, Indrid. There’s this big old cat in Sylvain that said he’ll make special stuff for us if we bring him certain things, and one of them was a seer’s spectacles or whatever. That’s you, give us some glasses, I’m done dancing around. We got a whole town to save, give us your fuckin’ specs.
Ned: Please.
Aubrey: Please.
Griffin: He says,
Indrid: Well, because you asked so nicely—
Griffin: And he slips off his spectacles, and instantly he transforms. And you all behold the Mothman. And he is terrifying to look at. I think there is a reason why local mythos around the Mothman sort of depicted him as something to be feared? It is because his— his form is— is sort of traditionally terrifying. He has these, uh, huge eyes, huge wings, a— just sort of an exposed thorax and mandibles?
Clint: Oh, god.
Griffin: And he is— he is pretty uh, upsetting to look at.
Ned: [crosstalk] Give him the damn glasses back—
Duck: [crosstalk] Yeah, put em back on—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Yeah, you can wear the glasses… do you have, like, a pair of reading glasses or sunglasses [Ned: Yeah!] you’re not using—
Duck: Yeah, any cool Ray-Bans that we could just have? That might count…
Griffin: He slips the glasses back on and he says,
Indrid: I’ll see what I can find.
Griffin: Uh, and— from outside—
Duck: Hey, wait, hold on, let me look in your— your cupboards. Oh hey look, found two glasses.
Travis: Perfect.
Griffin: From outside, as he slips his spectacles back on, you all hear the sound of, just, clanging and clattering? It sounds like trash cans are being knocked down outside. And you hear something fall to the ground. And like, as he slips his glasses back on, Indrid like looks to the windows and towards the door. And Indrid, to this point, has been this sort of like, uh, ethereal, stone-cold sort of figure, like Stone Cold Steve Austin, just like not super emotional, but now, like, he looks kind of worried because he was just the Mothman and something was there outside.
Travis: Aubrey’s on the move!
Griffin: Okay, you bound outside. Ned and Duck, are you heading out there too?
Clint: Ned doesn’t really bound, but yeah, he’ll kind of trail along behind.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay, as you all make it outside, you catch a figure, a person riding a dirt bike. They are wearing a sort of puffy winter jacket, and they have on a helmet that is covering their whole head, and they are on this dirt bike riding into the woods, sort of just— just beyond the Eastwood RV park that you all are at. You all can sort of just see them starting to take off.
Travis: Griffin, is there anything on the back of the jacket?
Griffin: There is, uh— you can just sort of make out a, uhh, sort of home-made— I think it’s a home-made patch— that sure enough looks like a hornet flying in mid-sting.
Travis: Mmmmm. My old nemesis. That person from a bunch of episodes ago.
[laughing]
Griffin: That would be Keith. The, uh—
Travis: Keith! Of course.
Griffin: Keith, the lieutenant of the, uh…
Travis: KEITH.
Ned: I’d— I’d say we go where the action is, man.
Duck: Yeah, absolutely.
Travis: Is Keith where the action is?
Clint: [crosstalk] Keith is the action.
Travis: Keith: it’s where the action is. [Clint laughing]
Griffin: Yeah, I mean sure—
Travis: Hi, I’m Keith—
Griffin: Keith is the only action that appears to be present here, uhh, I mean, as you all are heading outside, you hear the Mothman just kind of grumbling. He immediately— he, like, instantly starts, just like, packing things up inside of his Winnebago.
Travis: Oh no…
Clint: Did we get the spare glasses?
Griffin: Uh, yes. He managed to hand you a pair of spare reading glasses. Congratulations, you got those, was it worth it?
Travis: Yes.
Clint: We don’t know yet.
Griffin: Fair enough. Okay, so you all are trying to pursue Keith. I think uh, Aubrey, you’re sort of the first one to—
Travis: And I’m running.
Griffin: —to call this. Go ahead and yeah, act under pressure as you are, I mean, you’re trying to catch up with a dirt bike? Which is probably gonna be a tough putt, but, let’s— let’s see how you do. Oh my god.
Travis: How did I do… oh, not great. Uhh, rolled a 3.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Aubrey got a 3… all told. That’s quite bad. Okay. Ummm…
Travis: But, you know, Griffin, I learned something from my mistakes, and I’m gonna pick up an experience point.
Griffin: You do pick up an experience point, congratulations. Okay, you all run—run into the woods. I’m gonna take a hard move here, I’m trying to figure out what that looks like… Okay, you all hear the sound of the dirt bike sort of like, cruising deeper into the woods as you run out of the Eastwood RV Park chasing Keith. And then, you hear the, sort of tell-tale sound of a crash in the distance. And you hear, like, a scream shortly after this crash, and it seems to be like a— it is a long, pained, howl. And then you hear another sound, you hear a clang, like the sound of metal hitting something, and the scream stops.
Clint: I say we oughta run in the direction of the screaming that stopped.
Justin: Yes, I love it.
Travis: I agree.
Griffin: Okay, you all—
Ned: TO ACTION!
Griffin: You all find the dirt bike, it is like sort of crumpled into a fallen tree? And it’s still sort of like, faintly sputtering and dying. And then you see a clearing just beyond that log and see Keith, and he is on the ground. His helmet is off, you can clearly see his face, you see this lieutenant of the Hornets, which if you remember during the Lunar Interlude was very antagonistic towards you, and then Aubrey used magic and he kind of, uh, noticed that? [laughs] Because of a bad roll. And he is, he is in a bad way. One of his legs is like very clearly pretty fucked up, and he is unconscious, and is just, like, bleeding from the head. And the reason for that, you realized very quickly, is the goatman, standing over him. The goatman that is wielding—
Travis: A goatman, Griffin.
Griffin: A goatman, that is holding a shovel. And you put together that this goatman just knocked Keith right the fuck out.
Travis: Problem solved!
Griffin: You thank the goatman, and head back into the city, where you complete your quest to receive 50 gold coins.
[laughter]
Clint: Is Billy with us?
Griffin: Umm—
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, you guys have to like, tell me stuff like that.
Clint: Well, I assume wherever we go, he go.
Griffin: I mean— if you— if you bring him with you.
Clint: Yeah, I think we brought him with us.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: [crosstalk] We’re— we’re in charge of him— we need to to keep an eye on him.
Griffin: Okay, then if you brought Billy with you, the goatman turns and looks towards you, holding this sort of grizzly shovel as he stands over this human being that he just sort of destroyed, and looks at this, like, new person that is with you? And sort of cocks his head, sort of curious, and Billy starts to like, take slow steps toward the goatman kind of with his hands up trying to keep him calm.
Clint: I say Ned takes the watch off of Billy’s wrist.
Griffin: You just, like, pull it off?
Clint: Yeah, just stop him and, kind of pulls the watch off.
Griffin: Okay. As you do so, he transforms back into his goatman form. And now that you all have gotten to know Billy, you can kind of recognize some of the physiological differences between these two— like Billy is a smaller form than this goatman with the shovel is, and as you take off the watch and Billy turns back into a goatman, the other goatman looks confused at first and then he looks angry, and he starts charging at Billy with the shovel up.
Justin: Alright, well, I’m gonna have to tackle the angry goat. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: Okay, roll to Kick Some Ass.
Justin: [sighs] Wasn’t trying to kick this poor goat’s ass—
Clint: Isn’t angry goat an herbal thing?
Justin: No, Dad’s right, I’m gonna kick this poor goat’s ass.
Griffin: I just don’t know what else it could be—there is a thing in kick some ass about, like, put them where you want them, which I think for a tackle, it’d be like on the ground.
Justin: Yeah, but I guess I’m still risking the getting hurt. Anyway, umm, here it come.
Griffin: There it is.
Justin: That’s a, uhhh, 10.
Griffin: On a 10, you and the goatman deal harm to one another. Umm, I think with your tackle, you’re probably just dealing one harm right, cause you’re coming at him un— unequipped? And as you do so, I think he just headbutts you as you collide, and he’s got, you know, some horns, and that feels pretty awful. You take two harm, which I’m pretty sure is just negated by your natural armor? And you get to choose one: you gain the advantage— take plus one forward— you inflict terrible harm, you suffer less harm, or you force them where you want them.
Justin: I’m gonna force them where I want them, onto the ground.
Griffin: Okay. You do so.
Travis: Aubrey then takes that opportunity to move over to Keith.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And kind of holds her hands over him and says out loud,
Aubrey: I would like the bleeding to stop.
Griffin: Can you do that?
Travis: Umm, there is healing in use magic.
Griffin: Heal one harm from an injury or cure a disease or neutralize a person— a poison?
Travis: Yes.
Justin: [laughing] Poi-son! (like “person” with a strong accent)
Griffin: [laughing] A poi-son!
Justin: [crosstalk] Look at this guy—
Travis: [crosstalk] I wanna heal a poi-son!
Justin: [imitating Curly] Look at this schmuck, I wanna neutralize him!
Griffin: Uhh, okay, so go ahead and rooooll… your ball…?
Travis: Uhh, a 7.
Griffin: Okay, uhh, that is just barely a mixed success. On a mixed success, your spell works imperfectly— choose your effect and a glitch, your effect is that you are healing one harm from an injury, uhh, the Keeper will decide what effect the glitch has. So, the glitches are: the effect is weakened, the effect is of short duration, you take one harm ignore armor, the magic draws immediate unwelcome attention, it has a problematic side effect.
Travis: Umm, I’m going to say…
Griffin: Some of these are, not, like applicable, right? Like why would you take one harm from this— [Travis: Yeah.] how could this be a short duration—
Travis: Let’s go with draw unwanted attention?
Griffin: I love you, Travis. You’re such a good— you’re such a kind and giving brother. Okay, you do this and the— I mean, the broken leg is like broken, and there’s— that magic is not just going to— this isn’t Harry Potter with, fuckin’, a potion that makes bones like, fix? But the head wound, it just kind of— it doesn’t like, seal up as much as it sort of instantly, like coagulates and stops bleeding. The side effect of this is, while you’re in the middle of doing this, Keith opens his eyes and just like— sees you point blank doing magic on him. And I think he’s too sort of like, stupefied, to like, do anything about it, but he— he— he sees you doing magic.
Aubrey: Yeah, dude, I’m doing magic, saving your life, stay the fuck down.
Griffin: He just closes his eyes and he goes back out. You’ve— you’ve stabilized Keith, you have a goatman pinned to the ground. Let me do something, actually, because we sort of have something established about these creatures in an earlier episode that it wouldn’t make sense for them to not do here— the goatman that you have pinned to the ground does that, like, loud, shrieking bleat.
Umm, and you heard that once before, Duck, when you sort of fought the one goatman in the woods that made the other two appear. And as he does this, Billy for a second like turns towards you all like he is losing whatever sort of peaceful part of himself he— he realized when you showed him kindness, Duck, but he like shakes his head and turns back towards the goatman and he looks very worried as this thing sort of screams, and sure enough the third goatman, the one holding the shears, comes charging out of the woods towards your party. Uhh, now, Ned, I believe it’s your turn in the action, what do you want to do?
Travis: Did we— or how far— and I know I’m not Ned, I recognize that, I know that about myself— how far are from Barclay’s truck which we used to get to the trailer park?
Griffin: I mean, you’re uh, you know, maybe a couple hundred feet or so, I mean you ran out of— you ran away from the trailer park and chased a dirt bike down, so you got pretty far from the trailer park. Uh, Ned.
Clint: [chuckles] I think Ned is going to try to scare off the goatman with the scythe? Did you say it was scythe?
Griffin: …Scythe?
Travis: Shears.
Clint: Shears!
Griffin: Oh, shears. Yeah. I thought you were saying that Ned now had a— [laughing] Ned now had a scythe.
Travis: He reaches into his pocket, it’s a collapsible scythe.
Griffin: I stole this from the Grim Reaper! Okay, how are you doing that?
Clint: Just kind of running at him, and just waving my arms, and trying to—
Travis: [crosstalk] You make yourself big to scare an animal.
Clint: It’s a goat! I’m making myself big, he’s a goat, for god’s sake, he’s not gonna be that sophisticated a combatant, and—
[laughter from Justin and Travis]
Clint: He’s gonna be confused because he sees one buddy down on the ground, he sees another buddy who seems to be with these other people— [Griffin: Okay…] he’s gonna be in a vulnerable spot!
Griffin: Sure, yeah. You can tell there’s definitely a sort of vulnerability there in this charging monster goat’s eyes.
Clint: Would that be act under pressure or manipulate someone?
Griffin: I think it’s definitely manipulate someone, right? You’re giving them a reason, which is like, hey, this is a [laughing] confusing time for you and I’m a big man who’s like waving his arms around.
[laughter]
Travis: You’re going through a lot of changes right now.
Griffin: Don’t you wanna run away?
Clint: Yeah, so Ned just, does just that, and he just happens to— he has a big coat on, and he just goes running in making this “WAAHHOOAAOOO” noise.
Griffin: Oookay, let’s roll plus charm…
Clint: It’s an 8.
Travis: [laughing] Mixed success…
Griffin: Okay, so this is great. On a mixed success they’ll do it, but only if you do something for them right now to show that you mean it. If you ask too much, they’ll tell you what, if anything, it would take for them to do it.
Travis: Hmmmm…
[laughter]
Justin: Alright, stop— [laughing] roleplay this conversation. I want— I think the problem with this breakdown is that we said someone, and it’s like a goat person. So I don’t know how they can sign or signal to Dad with body language—
Griffin: You know what, that’s fair— there’s actually a rule in the book that you explicitly can’t do this with monsters unless you have like a special monster skill that lets you talk with monsters. Justin is right, I fucked that up, because it says “for a normal person”— these are, these are, you know, these are monsters. I think it would be act under pressure. So we’ll keep that— we’ll keep that roll— on a seven to nine the keeper is going to give you a worse outcome, hard choice, or price to pay. Uhh, the price to pay is… uhh… he’s going to run into you, right? He’s charging at you at speed? You’re gonna take some harm, but the bigger thing that’s gonna happen is you’re standing right next to Duck, he is going to sort of get knocked over, and they will go away, but both of them will go away. You will sort of lose your captivity on the one goat. So you can either let both goats go away, or this isn’t going to work.
Clint: Hmm… alright, it doesn’t work.
Griffin: Oh? It’s going to be quite bad for you then.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: [laughs] Okay. He just charges you with the shears. Uhh, and—
Clint: And it really and truly doesn’t phase him at all? Okay…
Griffin: I mean, you didn’t really think that one— I mean—
Clint: [crosstalk] No, I didn’t really think that one through.
Griffin: You can admit that’s not your best plan [Clint: No.] that you’ve ever sort of done.
Clint: Well, no, no, it wasn’t… well, maybe—
Travis: [crosstalk] Can I— can I help out?
Clint: [crosstalk] Maybe the sight of blood will scare him off. Mine.
Travis: Can I help out, not like— I’m still, after all this time, not a hundred percent sure how help out works.
Griffin: Right, so basically if somebody’s on the cusp— right— if somebody rolls a 6 or a 9, and you want to get them up to the 7 mixed success range or the 10 full success range, then you can drive roll and give them a plus 1.
Travis: But that wouldn’t really help if he has an 8 or whatever he got.
Griffin: That is correct. Umm…
Travis: Well, then could I use magic to at least try to like, divert the shears?
Griffin: No, I’m— I— no. [Travis: Okay.] This is the way the game works, Dad [Travis: Okay.] you know, made the roll he made and I gave him a choice and he chose not to do it. Uhh, this thing just sort of— it doesn’t impale you with these shears. I think he just— actually— he doesn’t, he wants to get you the hell out of the way because you can tell this thing is charging at Billy.
And the one that is on the ground, Duck, that you are holding down— like, you kind of did a similar thing to Billy, this thing is acting way different. It is like, screaming and wrestling against you, and like its eyes are rolling back, it is like— it is furious at sort of Billy’s, sort of, existence right now and the other one is doing the same thing. So as it’s charging you, it doesn’t impale you, it just sort of like holds the shears by one handle and slashes at you, and the force of the slash like knocks you out of the way and you are also hit for 2 harm as it sort of just slashes you across the chest. And I think there’s like a puff of down that comes out of your coat as this thing, uh, sort of cuts it open.
Clint: Okay. So do I add that to the other 2 harm I already had?
Griffin: Uh, you should’ve been back at 0 I think, right, it’s been—
Clint: [crosstalk] Good, okay. 2 harm.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, we had some time.
Griffin: Yeah. Okay. Aubrey, now I think it’s—
Ned: OWWW! GOSH! Aw, SHIT, damn. That thing did not work. That did not work.
Griffin: Yeah, this thing just bushido blades Ned to the ground.
Ned: [moaning in pain in the back]
Travis: So the situation as I understand it is right now I’m over Keith, [Griffin: Yep.] Keith is at least— [Griffin: Unconscious.] a little stabilized, and unconscious.
Griffin: Yeah, Keith is fine. I’ll give you— like you used your action to get Keith to be fine, I’m not gonna like cheat you out of that. He’s injured and he’s in a bad place, but he’s not gonna die.
Travis: Okay, I am going to use magic. [Griffin: Okay.] Um and I’m going to use force or wind, um, to— at the goatman’s legs.
Griffin: So this is your— this is your magical attack, right?
Travis: Correct.
Griffin: Then you just roll to Kick Some Ass, um, so you roll plus weird and then we’ll resolve it from there. Wow, damn! Good rolls…
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah so that’s…
Griffin: [crosstalk] Aubrey got a 10 on that roll.
Travis: I got a 10!
Griffin: Okay! Uh, you blast this thing, uh, how much— how much harm do you do?
Travis: Um with the—
Griffin: Give me your tags, like you got blast… You have not used a magical attack in a while.
Travis: Yeah, plus 1 magical harm forceful to a base and my base is 2 harm.
Griffin: Okay. Alright, so this is 3 harm right?
Travis: Yup.
Griffin: Okay, you get an extra effect right? Because you rolled— uh, you got a 10. So you can gain the advantage, take plus one forward, give one to another hunter, you inflict terrible harm plus one harm, you suffer less harm, or you force them where you want them.
Travis: I’m gonna say I force them where I want them, ‘cause I wanna knock them down.
Griffin: Yeah I mean, you’re gonna do that. Um, you step in the way of this goatman and he tries to do the same thing to you that he did with Ned, but like, right as the shears sort of slash against you for 2 harm, which I think you block some of right? Because your magic— magic vest…
Travis: [crosstalk] Yes, correct, so I take one harm.
Griffin: You sort of hold out your hands and like just as he comes in contact with you— I actually like the image of you like holding out your hands and as he’s like charging you, he like finds himself slowed by the wind that is like coming out of your hands and just as you like lay hands on him, he goes— goes flying. Is that kind of what you’re wanting to do? Just like knock him away? [Travis: Yeah!] Uh, you knock him away and he just— he— he fucking goes dude. He goes— he goes flying into the distance and you actually— he is like flying horizontal he collides with a tree sort of backwards and bends kind of around the tree a bit, uh, and you hear sort of a crack as he does so and then he falls to the ground.
Travis: Oh goodness.
Griffin: Uh, and—
Travis: [crosstalk] For three harm?
Griffin: Yep.
Aubrey: Oh…. Golly!
Griffin: This thing is a— this thing is a minion so they are not going to be the hardiest of fighters.
Travis: … Okay.
Aubrey: Billy, I hope that’s okay— can you help me with Keith, please?
Griffin: Billy looks kind of stunned, for a second? And starts to walk towards his felled— uh, former companion. And then he’s kind of like, shaken out of whatever primal instinct he seems to have, uh, and he starts to walk over to where Keith is lying on the ground. Duck, we gotta like, resolve this ‘cause you are still on top of this thing— and now that it just saw one of its companions go down, it is freaking out. It is starting to… it is starting to fight against you for real— for real.
Justin: Um. I’m gonna try to— punch it… in the— head, so it goes unconscious.
Griffin: [laughs] Okay.
Justin: No sword yet. I mean, I’m not— Beacon's staying sheathed. He would love to get up in this, I’m sure, but I am just gonna— I’m just trying to knock this thing out.
Griffin: Uh… I mean, this has to be a Kick Some Ass, right? And it— I think if you do enough unarmed harm to it, you can, y’know, elect to make it unconscious rather than… just kill it.
Justin: Uh, I… I feel like I should have some sort of advantage. I feel like if you’re laying on top of something…
Griffin: Yeah, I’ll give you— I’ll give you +1 for— [Justin: Kicking its ass—] I think you set that up with your— well, no, ‘cause you didn't really choose that with your former… right? If you had chosen “You gain the advantage and take +1 Forward”, I’d give it to you, but you didn't—
Justin: [crosstalk] That's fair… yeah, that’s—
Travis: [crosstalk] “So fuck off.”
Griffin: This thing's— this thing’s bigger and stronger than you, so it can— it is not unreasonable that it can just like, kick you off and… run away.
Justin: Okay… well.
Griffin: Holy shit, it's not gonna do that! So, these fuckin’ rolls, that’s a 12!
Justin: A 12 on that one.
Griffin: Alright. Uh.
Travis: I’d like that you say “these rolls”, but I'm looking at this line, Griffin. Yeah, there’s a 10 and a 10 and a 12, but there’s also a 7, an 8, and a 3.
Griffin: Yeah, 3 is… 3 was rough. Okay, um. Yeah. You do deal harm to each other, uh, I think—
Travis: [crosstalk] [laughs] I picture them headbutting each other.
Griffin: No, I think what it is, is— this thing does get the upper-hand for a second, and kind of rolls on top of you, and punches you. Uh, and you take some harm, that is just— negated by your armor, because you're awesome. And then you roll back on top of it, and— uh, clobber it. What's your extra effect here?
Justin: I’m gonna— um… “Take one forward.”
Griffin: … or “Give plus one forward to another hunter”?
Justin: Sure. That’s— that’s the one.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Alright. Uh, this thing is looking pretty— pretty beat-up, at this point. But, it is not, uh… quite unconscious yet.
Justin: I'm really strugglin’, because I feel like interactions with Billy— I’ve humanized these things a lot more, and I’m really struggling with this fight, because I feel like… if they were just monstrosities, I would have already gotten… y’know—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, for sure.
Justin: [crosstalk] Maybe get on a little bit of the snicker-snack. (This is a reference to The Jabberwocky)
Griffin: I mean, I— I don’t hate that, right? Like, these things have been uh, sort of vilified since the— the 80s when they first started showing up in Kepler, and they have been sort of dealt with with extreme prejudice, and for the first time, you all kind of like… turned one? So like, uh… This— this being doesn’t seem to be as amenable to peaceful talks— [Justin: Probably can’t hang.] as Billy was, uh—
Justin: Uh, this one can’t chill— probably has zero chill [Griffin: Yeah.] on this one.
Griffin: Okay. uh—
Justin: We should have a chill rating for these monsters.
Griffin: Okay, this one is— zero. Billy is chill as hell, um… chill AF, this one is— is not.
Justin: Now Griffin, are you sure you wanna use zero chill…
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: [laughing] …already? Seems like we're gonna be—
Travis: [crosstalk] Like this as low as the chill gets, Griffin?
Griffin: Yeah, okay, the—
Justin: [crosstalk] Seems like—
Griffin: The beast monster that absorbed forest animals and tried to murder you as like a— in the form of an 8-foot bear, that one had no fucking chill whatsoever.
Travis: [crosstalk] Okay— so this is like a 4?
Justin: It's like a 4!
Griffin: [crosstalk] It's like a 2 “chill”.
Justin: Okay.
Travis: This is like a 2— okay. Wow, it’s a big scale!
Griffin: Yeah. Um… Ned, I think it’s you, ‘cause all you’ve done so far is get stabbed.
Clint: So—
[laughter]
Justin: Drag him.
Clint: So, other than— other than bleeding in somebody’s face— Okay, so… Is Duck still… holding down… the goatman?
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: Okay, so then Ned— he’s going to use the… [drawn out] Chicane Cane… And— and whack the goatman in the head.
Griffin: Golf swing? Okay.
Clint: Yeah, it’s gonna be— it looks like it’s about a par three…
Griffin: [crosstalk] Sure. Okay,
Clint: So he’s just going to rear back and I mean— for one thing, Ned’s a little mad because he’s— he’s wounded. [crosstalk] Besides—
Travis: [crosstalk] And his good coat was ruined.
Clint: And it’s not like it’s— y’know, a really brave move ‘cause he’s— being held down. [Griffin: Yeah, okay—] He’s basically attacking a— y’know, a helpless creature.
Griffin: Roll to uh, Kick Some Ass— plus tough.
Clint: “Kick Some Ass”… plus tough, which is zero… And that would be… [pause] Shit.
Griffin: Oh, 7’s a mixed success. You’re fine.
Clint: [sarcastically] Oh, great! Oh, great, more mixed success!
Griffin: Uh… On a 7+, you all inflict harm on each other— um… I don’t— I don’t— this is not applicable; Duck is holding him down, you do a golf swing with your club before he can inflict any harm on you. [crosstalk] I mean—
Clint: [crosstalk] Well I mean, he could pull a hammy or somethin’!
Griffin: [crosstalk] He’s teetering on the edge. Uh, he—
Travis: Or, the cane could break.
Griffin: Uh, no— this isn’t like a...“I can do something bad”, this is just like— how this normally works is you guys deal harm to each other. Um… [stammering] You swing this club down, and— knock him out.
Clint: Okay? And what happens to Ned?
Travis: He slips as he’s doing it—
[laughter]
Griffin: Yeah, you—
Clint: [yelling] My back!
Griffin: You twist your shoulder good. Um— no, I don’t think— I’m not gonna deal any harm to you here. Uh— okay! That’s it, I mean— you have one goat-man unconscious, one… seemingly dead, and Aubrey and Billy are dragging Keith back to the truck— uh, I’m guessing to get him to St. Francis Medical Center?
Travis: Uh, no. We’re taking him to the infirmary in the— in… I almost said “Great Wolf Lodge”— but, Keith— he knows far too much.
Griffin: Okay. Uh…
Clint: Isn’t that more of a pet hospital, though?
Griffin: [strained] It is, so—
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: You’ll have to deal with that— um… Oh, what else— what are the other two of you doing? Just taking off? Going with?
Justin: Uh— yeah well, we should stick together, I think.
Griffin: Okay.
Aubrey: What about— what about the unconscious goatman?
Clint: Bring him.
Justin: [sarcastic] Yeah, we’ll just keep building our menagerie—
Travis: Goodness gracious.
Justin: Um— seems unnecessary…
Clint: [goading] Yeah, c’mon!
Duck: Uh, [crosstalk] no—
Travis: [crosstalk] We’re gonna have to build a second basement.
Duck: We shou— uh… Ah man, I hate this. I don’t know— um…
Aubrey: Are there any chains in the truck from like— snow tires or whatever? We can chain him to a tree, come back—
Duck: Oh that’s a good— that’s a good idea, yeah! Yeah, I’ll use the chains from—
Ned: [sarcastic] That’s nice and humane!
Duck: Well I mean it’s—
Aubrey: [sarcastic] Or we could kill him, Ned!
Duck: Or I mean, we could bury— bury him alive… somewhere— what’re we doing? Like—
[Griffin laughs]
Duck: I— this is fine! We’ll put him in jail, he’s in jail!
Griffin: …What?
Travis: He’s in woods jail!
Justin: He was in woods jail! We— Let’s chain him up!
Travis: We’re not gonna leave him here. We’ll come back, but like— I don’t want him to wake up in the back of the truck.
Griffin: [crosstalk] … Alright.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Alright. Yeah you chain him up. Uhhh as you are—
Justin: I have a great idea. I have a great idea.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay. Okay.
Justin: I wanna put him in the truck and then I’m going to take him to Indrid. Let the two of them kick it.
Travis: [laughter]
Justin: See if he could get anything out of him.
Griffin: Indrid…
Travis: [crosstalk] So like chain him up, but be like, “Hey here’s the goat, he’s all chained up.”
Justin: [crosstalk] “You’re gonna stay at my friends Indrid’s house.” [laughs]
Griffin: You chain him up and— I’m assuming you and Ned— like this is a big thing probably need help, uh, dragging his weight back to the RV park. Uh, you drag him back and as you are all sort of like getting loaded up, when you look inside the Winnebago, it is actually— it has been all cleaned up. Uh, and, uh Indrid is like unplugging the RV from the utilities hook up at the at the RV park. And he says:
Indrid: Well it’s uh— unfortunately, my time here has come to an end.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Wait, wha— where? Why?
Ned: [crosstalk] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Whoa.
Indrid: I’ve— I… You all don’t understand how people in this world feel about… me. And I— I— I— you all seem more reasonable than most folk when it comes to the beings from Sylvain, but that is unfortunately not true for the vast majority of you. Uh, I have been discovered before and only narrowly escaped my fate so…
Aubrey: Do you mean this dude? Has this dude saw—
Travis: And I point to broken leg-unconscious guy.
Indrid: I can appreciate that you have apprehended him, are you going to— are you going to kill him?
Aubrey: Well, let me put it this way Indrid, he also knows that I do magic and that there are goatmen running around. So like, we’re kind of all in the same shitty boat, you and I, and all of us. So, like I don’t see us, like, just letting him go, scott free go tell everybody, you know what I mean? So… I don’t think you need to move just yet.
Justin: Are you talking about Keith? Are you saying we’re gonna kill Keith?
Travis: I’m not saying we’re gonna kill Keith! But—
Griffin: [crosstalk] This is— This is the conversation right? Like, Indrid says:
Indrid: I— Aubrey, you’re… new at this. I have been in this game for a long time and unless you’re willing to put an end to this human’s life, eventually the word is going to get out, and I am not going to be here when it does.
Duck: Nah, that’s fair, that’s fair. Hey listen, I got a question for you though; are you done with your ‘bago? Are you gonna leave that there? What’s the story with that?
Indrid: I’m going to take it with me, on— on the road. It’s my vehicle.
Duck: Okay well listen, can you— can we ask one thing of you, then? Can you take this goatman with ya and then just like, take him far away from here, and leave him somewhere where he’s not gonna do anymore harm. I feel li—
Travis: [crosstalk] And maybe you all like have advanta— adventures out there on the road, maybe.
Duck: [crosstalk] If we could separate him from whatever it is that’s running the show for a little while, might just give us room to breathe. I don’t wanna kill the thing, but uh, maybe— maybe separating it is, is a, is— is a solution.
Griffin: Um…
Duck: I’m not saying you gotta do like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with the thing. Just take it a hundred fucking miles out of town [Clint laughs] and then let— let it go bud, it’s not a big ask.
Griffin: I think you would realize that that wouldn’t work just because these, uh, abominations can’t… be outside of the one mile perimeter of the— of the archway. So like if he did this, I don’t even know what would happen, as he passes through the archway, like [chuckles], would the goatman just like turn to ash in his car? That might be an upsetting experience for Indrid.
I— I— wanna actually wanna back up, because I th— it felt like Aubrey was trying to convince him to stay, which would probably be a manipulate someone roll. I don’t wanna just like, you know, force him out of the story if you can make a case for why he should stick around and it— [Travis: Yeah!] sounds like that’s what you’re trying to do so I wanna, like, give you the agency to do that.
Justin: I’m not gonna back Aubrey’s play though if her action— her “To-Be” verb is “will kill Keith to keep moth friend.” I cannot…
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m not saying I’ll kill Keith. Listen, I’m telling you right now, like, there’s a lot on the line here and frankly, we’ve already got like— we’ve got Billy that we’re covering for and gonna have to take care of, we’ve got what’s-his-face in the basement, like, we’re covering up a lot of shit here at this point. I don’t think ‘to murder’ [Griffin: Okay.] has to be the only solution we’ve got. [Griffin: Yeah.] And like…
Griffin: Ye— y— you’re— you’re good. I think roll to manipulate someone, the, sort of, stakes being like, “I will take care of this. I will—”
Travis: 11!
Griffin: Holy shit! Alright, uh, on a 10+, uh, they’ll do it for the reason you gave ‘em. He nervously, like, tosses his keys up in the air, like, and catches them over and over again and he says:
Indrid: Okay. Fine. I— I don’t— I don’t see any futures where I’m being drawn and quartered quite yet, so I suppose I can take your word for it Aubrey.
Aubrey: Absolutely, and— and I’ll make you a deal even, like, 48 hours. You know what I mean? And if you haven’t— if we haven’t figured it out in 48 hours and you wanna skedaddle, absolutely, I totally get it.
Indrid: Okay… I’ll leave you all to it.
Griffin: And he heads back inside the Winnebago. Uh…
Aubrey: Now that you are staying though…
Griffin: [quickly] He pokes his head back out—
Indrid: Yes?
Aubrey: Um, to Duck’s point, could you… maybe… babysit?
Indrid: Your goatman?
Aubrey: Well one of them.
Duck: [crosstalk] Just one— [Indrid: Um-] not the chill one, the one that was [Aubrey: Not the chill one.] zero chill.
Griffin: He says,
Indrid: Sure, I— I uh, I get bored. [Duck: Great.] Let’s— let’s— let’s have him.
Griffin: Uh and he—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] We’re gonna call this one… Jonathan. Jonathan Gruff.
[snickering in background]
Indrid: That’s fun.
Aubrey: Yeah. So you take care of Jonathan Gruff—
Clint: [laughs] You’ve thought about that for a month haven’t ya?
Travis: No, [Clint laughs] it just occurred to me.
Justin: Oh! Jona— Jonathan Gru— Gruf— okay. Very goo—
Griffin: And then the scene suddenly ends. [laughter]
{Ad break from 42:28 - 48:15}
Griffin: Uh, you three? Four? Five? [Travis: Yeah five…] If Keith counts ‘cause he’s—
Travis: And I think Barclay is probably there too at this point. He’s been…
Griffin: Six? And, um…
Travis: Thacker’s there too, but I don’t know if you count him.
Griffin: Seven? Yeah, the— the— all of you are, uh, back in the Pine Guard headquarters under Amnesty Lodge. And you have brought Keith to the infirmary— I’m just gonna like… I want to support you, Travis, as a player and as my brother. I don’t know— [chuckles] stitching up, like uh, a stab wound I can— I think is within the realm of possibilities, setting a broken leg is maybe not? But, uh—
Travis: Well I assume we’ve got some painkillers or something right? Some kind of, [Griffin: Okay.] like I actually— I don’t think my goal right now is to fix him.
Griffin: Jesus Christ! Okay… This is going to—
Travis: You gotta let me play it out.
Griffin: —Yeah for sure, for sure. Ok I think that. I— I wanna give you all a sort of investigation time during this part so umm, if you wanna like set that up, then I think this is the time to do it. But you all are sort of here and uhh the situation is fairly calm, I mean Thacker is still in the panic room and you all are going to eventually need to feed him or whatever the fuck. But uhh I guess you’ll cross that bridge when you come to it.
Travis: Uhh so Keith is still unconscious so we’re all just kinda standing around looking at him I guess like—
Griffin: You’re all sort of [Duck: Alright.] praying— you’re praying over Keith in this moment.
Duck: Alright. Amen. Listen guys. First off, great prayer. Uhhh [Aubrey: Yeah.] I could really—
Aubrey: Another good one.
Duck: — I could really feel the lord working in this uh converted veterinarian's office tonight.
Clint: [laughing]
Duck: Uhhh, secondly, here’s what we got. I think things that are still lingering. One: we know that Juno is involved somehow. I gotta figure out what Juno is up to. Or— or— or how Juno is tied in, uh to this whole thing. Billy I need you— [Justin: And I’m pointing at him] — I need you to take Ned into the forest and show him what you’re growing. And I’ll give you… you know some oats or whatever.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Scooby snacks.
Duck: Scooby snacks. Yeah that, I love that—
Billy: [bleating] Pizza!
Justin: —this is my, this is my— [Clint: Pizza!] — gritty Scooby Doo reboot 2018, Ned is Shaggy, Billy is Scooby uhhh— [Griffin: This is— this is— ] [Travis: I— I call—]
Clint: [crosstalk] [imitating Shaggy] Goshh, c’mon Billy.
Justin: Let’s get that— let’s get that art— [laughs] Twitter get that art into my box, post haste. Julia!! I need fanart of my Dad as Shaggy, and this goat man as Scooby.
Clint: [laughing]
Justin: Uhh— [Griffin: Uhh] — and then we uhh— and then—
Griffin: Aubrey needs to murder this boy.
Duck: I think, Aubrey, you’re going to kill this boy named Keith.
Aubrey: I’m not— I’m not going to kill anybody.
Duck: So you’re going to kill Keith [Aubrey: I’m not going to kill Keith!] I’ll— I’ll take, I’ll, uhh, I’ll go talk to Juno and then Ned, do you and Billy wanna check out the plant...or whatever it is they’re growing? [Ned: Yeah, yeah] My note is beanstock, by the way. If we're— if we're— [Aubrey: Uuh!] putting in uh… [Ned: Ooh! That would be awesome.] Yeah. I wanna make cool, lovely—
Clint: Or a great, big Audrey. ""Feed me, Seymour!""
Justin: Wait, that doesn't make any sense what you just said. [Clint: I know it doesn't.] Audrey is—
Clint: Audrey was the plant.
Justin: Yeah, but—
Clint: [crosstalk] Audrey II was—
Justin: [crosstalk] We already—
Travis: [crosstalk] Audrey II—
Justin: We already have an Audrey. On our team.
Travis: I'm Aubrey.
Justin: Aub— drey.
Clint: Oh, that would be confusing.
Justin: No, but it's just what I'm saying. It'd be confusing.
Ned: Okay, yeah, I'll take Billy into the woods because that seems like the safest thing to do— to go into the night's (nice?) dark woods. And it'll give me some, you know, some opportunities to sing some songs from Into the Woods you know, because that's kinda my thing. I would suggest, uh, Aubrey that as you deal with Keith, you bring in Jake Cool-Ice. 'Cause it seems like they have beef and it might make the murdering go a little bit easier. [crosstalk]
Aubrey: [crosstalk] I'm not gonna murder him!
Ned: You know just— at least just— at least be open to the idea. Just think about it.
Griffin: All right. I believe that's— And then the scene suddenly ends. [laughing] That's such a powerful card, why have I never played that one before? It could have gotten me out of so many scrapes these past few years. Uhm, no, I mean, I think what happens is Ned and Duck leave to go— and Billy leave to do their respective things. And why don't we just stick with the scene of Aubrey now, uh, over Keith, who is starting to sort of be— be— be— what's the verb I'm looking for? [incomprehensible] [Travis: Rousing.] Be— be rousing back to consciousness.
Travis: I'm going to say that in the meantime I have somehow strapped down Keith's legs so that in his like waking up he won't like thrash around and—
Justin: [crosstalk] You want it to be quick and painless.
Travis: I’m not gonna kill Keith!
Griffin: Okay, all right, Dexter. Uh. He wakes up—
Clint: [crosstalk] Put plastic down!
Justin: Yeah, don’t make a mess.
Griffin: He looks kinda groggy. [Travis: Hello, Keith.] He says,
Keith: Hey… What the— What the hell did you do to me? What’s going on?
Aubrey: I know— I— I didn’t do anything. How are you doing?
Keith: …Bad. I w— uh.
Aubrey: Yeah, you were attacked by a goatman, right?
Keith: Is that… Was that real?
Aubrey: Yep. Uh, yeah, unfortunately that was.
Keith: Are— [sigh] Where’s my bike?
Aubrey: Your bike was trashed, Keith, I’m sorry. Goatman tore it up pretty good.
Griffin: He tries to get up and…
Aubrey: Uh, I wouldn’t— I wouldn’t.
Griffin: I mean he immediately like winces and says,
Keith: Where— Where are— where are we? Is this a hospital?
Aubrey: Well, we’re somewhere safe, Keith. But before… [With a West Virginian accent] before we get y’all fixed up, I need to talk to you. And I don’t know why I’m falling into a West Virginian accent. Except that, you’re doing it and now I’m mirroring it.
Keith: It’s intoxicating. [Aubrey: It really is.] Listen, I don’t know what the fuck you think you’re doing. You need to get me to a hospit— you need to— [shouting] Help!
Aubrey: Well, Keith.
Griffin: He— he—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] I would say at this point I don’t need to do anything. At this point, you are the one who needs to listen. Do you understand?
Griffin: I think you need to do something here because he is like, he has started to… for sure yell for help. He realizes he’s been kidnapped and of course that’s like first thing—
Travis: I’m gonna do something I’ve always wanted to do in real life.
Griffin: Okay!
Travis: Aubrey snaps her fingers and her right hand ignites in flame.
Griffin: Uh… Okay. [Travis giggles] You’re trying to like intimidate him. I don’t think this is a roll. This would be intimidating for anyone. [Travis: Yep!] Uh— He— he— he stops his shouting and looks at your hand and he says,
Keith: I fucking knew it. I fucking knew that you were doing something weird back at the ski slopes. [Aubrey: Okay.] Wha— What is this?
Aubrey: Well, that is a big question, Keith. And what it is, is none of your goddamn business.
Griffin: He like smiles and like immediately winces again and like reaches for his leg, and he says,
Keith: Listen there, Harry Potter, like I— I—
Travis: Aubrey starts lowering her hand towards his face.
Keith: Okay… Okay.
Aubrey: You’re gonna stop talking and you’re gonna listen. [Griffin: He does.] Now, I’m here to do good. I’m helping. Because imagine that if I weren’t helping, you wouldn’t have woken up. Do you understand me, Keith?
Griffin: He nods.
Aubrey: And now, if you agree, I’m gonna get a doctor. And we’re gonna say that you were in an accident, riding your bike down the hill. You broke your leg and hit your head on a tree in the fall. And we can get you all fixed up. Right? But I want you to understand something, Keith. If you breathe a word… of anything that you’ve seen… I will burn you from the inside out. Do you understand me?
Griffin: This is a Manipulate Someone. And it’s a— it— I think this is like a pretty big one. [Clint: A damn good one.] Right? This is— this is— this is— uh… determining whether or not he’s gonna keep this secret or not. And the thing you’re giving him is not being burned alive. From the inside out.
Travis: Correct… No.
Griffin: Yeah, oh…
Travis: Uh… How much luck do I have left?
Griffin: I mean you still have… luck.
Travis: Yeah, I’m gonna use a luck, this is very important.
Griffin: I would say this is. If not now— [Travis: Right.] If not now, then when?
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m gonna burn my luck, yeah.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I could take a hard move that could be pretty fucking hard. [Travis: Yeah.] Okay, go ahead and mark it in the character sheet.
Travis: I did.
Griffin: All right. You’re over halfway through your luck. And again—
Travis: Does that also give me experience if you use luck? Or is that like “you use luck and it’s an automatic success”?
Griffin: It doesn’t, it doesn’t. You don’t get experience.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: It’s a success. Uhm… He… He takes a beat and he… and I think his— his p— pride is like more than his pain. Like, keeping him from making this decision. He does not like somebody sort of lording power over him. But he says,
Keith: All right, all right. You gotta tell me— You g— You gotta tell me one thing. I won’t tell anybody, I don’t wanna get killed. I just… I just wanna get back home and go to bed. Probably should get to the hospital and get my leg fixed up first. But you gotta tell me one thing, Aubrey. [pause] Was that the fucking Mothman?
Aubrey: Don’t be ridiculous, Keith.
Griffin: He… I think slumps back down to the table, and…
Travis: And when he slumps back down, like the fire immediately goes out of Aubrey’s hand and she just starts shaking. Like you know that like— brave face— ‘Cause like, I’d picture myself in this scenario of like. She was bluffing. I mean, I— I— I think that using her magic to hurt someone…
Griffin: Yeah, for sure.
Travis: And so I think that this adrenaline then of like “thank god it fucking worked”. You know? Like shaking and she slumps, too. You know [Griffin: Yeah.] and like, pretty exhausted.
Travis: [crosstalk] I just wanna establish like—
Griffin: [crosstalk] For sure, like— like and it definitely does work. Like you— you— I think the next things that happen and they don’t have to happen on-screen. You get him to the hospital and he does as you say and does not put everybody on blast.
Uhm… Let’s do Duck next. Duck, when you go looking for Juno you realize she’s on service in the Monongahela Forest, tonight. And when you get to the ranger station that you all sort of operate out of, one of the walkie-talkies has— is like— she— she’s not there. And one of the walkie-talkies has been pulled out of the charging cradle where all the walkie-talkies are. And so you call out to her in order to find her. Unless you all share some sort of telepathic link, I think this like the most narratively logical way for you to find her. And she tells you where she is.
She is… she is in like this grove of trees just off one of the main paths through the forest. It’s actually fairly close to the ranger station where you’re at. Uh… It’s sort of late evening as you get into the grove where she is. And… There is a, you know, bright moonlight overhead and you both are— She’s carrying a lantern, you’ve got a flashlight and you see her as you walk into this grove. She sounded kind of upset on the radio and as you arrive you see… you see why.
All around this grove are signs of just petty vandalism. There’s uh… you know graffiti that’s gone up on some of the trees surrounding you. There are chunks that have been crudely chopped out of a handful of pine trees all around this grove. And you find Juno bent over a stump and she’s laboring with something. She’s using a claw hammer to try and pry these long copper nails, almost like these long copper spikes, that someone has pounded into a stump. And she looks up at you as you enter the grove and she says,
Juno: Seems like we… we missed quite the party here, Duck.
Duck: Yeah. Yeah. I uh… I hate to see this sorta thing. It always bums me out.
Griffin: She wipes her nose like on her jacket sleeve. And gets to work trying to like pry these copper nails out of the stump again. She says,
Juno: Prolly those Hornets getting up to no good.
Duck: Yeah, yeah. Uh. You know, about that. Here, let me help you with those— Let me give it a shot.
Griffin: Okay!
Justin: And uh… I wanna try to pull one out, I guess. I’m not saying that like she can’t just— there’s probably other things. [crosstalk] For her to do so...
Griffin: Yeah, I mean there’s lots to do around here. So uh… Fine. Yeah, you— I mean you very uh… I mean it takes a bit, right? There’s like a dozen of these like long, thick, copper nails. Not like railroad spikes, more like sort of like crochet needles that have been pounded into this stump. And you are able to sort of pull them out with this claw hammer fairly easily. And she starts walking around picking up trash and throwing it into a bag. She says,
Juno: I just— I don’t— I don’t… I don’t get it, Duck. A bunch of kids going around, coming into our forest and try to— try to kill bunch of trees what’s older than they are. And f— for what? [crosstalk] T— to—
Duck: [crosstalk] Now, now, Juno. As I— I— I keep telling everybody it’s not our forest, it’s their forest. We just… keep it, you know, safe so… it’ll still be there when they’re grown up and not a bunch of little idiots.
Juno: But if they keep doing shit like this, Duck, it ain’t gon’ be here. I’d— I’d just— It boggles the mind. I don’t— I don’t remember getting into anything like this back in my, you know, teen years. Do you?
Duck: Well, yeah. No, but I mean… Not in the forest. Nah, there’s plenty of closed down places we used to go into uh— I remember we used to go into {{1:02:26 Altizer’s?}} and uh… Remember that old department— there’s like furniture store. We used to go in there and ‘cause they kept saying they were gonna reopen. But it had been like ten years. We used to go in there and… and get high and…
Griffin: [laughing]
Travis: WHAT!?
Duck: Play uh....Roller h— Roller derby. We would like [Clint giggles] roller hockey. Remember? We’d put on skates—
Travis: You know how kids always get high and [laughing] play roller hockey.
Justin: [crosstalk] There’s a fucking teenager, what do you want?
Griffin: She laughs and she says,
Juno: I— I haven’t thought about that in… damn, Duck. I can’t remember how long—
Duck: I’m just saying, that we had a different— [Juno: They’re so- it’s different—] we had a different setting. We had a different setting, but we were still… pretty stupid. [laughing]
Juno: I know, but this ain’t just stupid, Duck. This is— This is mean. And it just feels like folks are… gettin’… meaner, generally speaking. I moved down here from Morgantown, I thought I’d get… you know, a cushion from all that. I didn’t think stuff like that happened at a town like this. I guess… I guess I was wrong.
Griffin: Uh And she like, walks around and uh… uh… sort of surveys the damage to one tree that’s kinda had some, some bark stripped off of it. Umm, she says,
Juno: I’m probably just— I’m sorry for being so… you know, nihilistic. It’s just I’m probably still shaken up from what happened back at the train. I would’ve— Duck, Duck what’s been going on with you?
Duck: Gosh, Juno. I… think… this is going to be hard for you to hear, but… other than just vandalism and what all. I think the Hornets are growing pot. I think they’ve gotten an illegal grow operation going. And I’ve been trying to keep it quiet because if they knew we were onto them, they would burn the whole thing to the ground. Uh… and other than getting some sparrows pretty heinously baked, it would also lose us a big lead and give us a chance to put some of them in jail for a real long time. So I’ve been trying to keep it quiet.
Griffin: She… this is— [laughs] [Travis: I— I— just want to say—] —this is one of Duck’s better lies, [Travis: Yeah.] I mean, I’m impressed. Um she says,
Juno: Well, I mean my next question is uh… are you sort of revisiting your stoner days? ‘Cause I— I gotta tell you Duck, and I hesitated to tell you this but I saw you, I walked into the ranger station one night and I don’t think you saw me but you were having an animated conversation with somebody who I don’t think was there. Was that you, did you stumble across some of their stash and maybe dip into it or…?
Duck: Honestly… uh if I gotta tell you the truth, Juno, I’m— I was trying to get into character. I’ve been— [Juno: You’re going undercover with these teens?] —I’m going undercover. I got a undercover teenage identity.
Travis: [laughing]
Duck: It’s— it’s Frick Richums and when I assume the identity of Frick Richums, I’m trying to get undercover, with the Hornets [hisses] so I can find their [Griffin: She—] illegal grow thing. [grunts]
Griffin: She— she reaches into her jacket like, just like staring at you like, takes out like a piece of gum. Pops it into her mouth. And she says,
Juno: You are a truly miserable liar, Duck Newton.
Duck: [shouting] Goddamnit! [Griffin: She lau—] [Travis laughing] I put on such a good— damnit!
Griffin: She laughs and like finishes picking up the detritus all around. And she says,
Juno: Hey, when you’re finished with the… with those, those nails. Would you mind taking them back to the station? I need to sort of keep going around the perimeter see if I can find something to, you know, maybe help with your investigation to take down those— those drug kingpins, the Hornets.
Duck: Yeah, Juno, about that. I— I was kidding about that, of course. [Clint laughs] I was just having some fun. But I did… I did hear some of them talking on Facebook about you and how they were gonna target you. Like they need to get you out of the way. And it kinda freaked me out a little bit. Can you think of any reason anybody would wanna get you… outta the way? Or— or be targeting you? Like… for this?
Griffin: I almost think this is “Investigate a Mystery”, right? Like—
Justin: It is. In the clumsiest way possible.
Griffin: Yeah. Go ahead and roll Investigate a Mystery.
Justin: Uh sorry, what skill does that go up against?
Griffin: Sharp… Good god a 13. These— 13, 10, 10, 12, 11, 13.
Travis: [crosstalking] Well, here’s the deal, Duck.
Griffin: Yes, you’re [stuttering] you do the, like, universe mind meme and know everything. Well, you get to ask questions, right? So let’s see. You, on a 10+ hold two. So “What happened here?”, “What kind of creature is it?”, “What can it do?”, What can hurt it?”, “Where did it go?”, “What’s being concealed here?”, “What was it going to do?”
Justin: “What’s being concealed here?”, I think is the way I wanna go.
Griffin: Okay. Uhm… Hm. I can tell you, and this is, I think this is you acting on like what you know about sort of protecting the forest. The copper spikes that you’re holding and the hammer that you’re holding, it’s like— it’s almost apocryphal, it’s almost like a myth. But there is, you know, mythos about pounding a copper nail into a tree is enough to kill it. And so like, the thing—
Justin: Kill what?
Griffin: A tree.
Justin: Okay, oh. Right.
Griffin: So the thing that you’re holding in your hand, like you remember that. That just sort of jumps to mind from your memory as a ranger. I think the other thing that you know is not being concealed is anything about Juno. She’s not a secret crime fighter. She’s not a, you know, weapon of destiny. She’s just your friend and coworker at the ranger service.
Travis: Oh, so that’s like the weakness. Is the copper, ‘cause we’re fighting the big plant thing, probably.
Griffin: Just put it up on the table there.
Justin: So, why would they target Juno? To keep me from figuring this out? Okay. Okay.
Travis: It has future-seeing powers too, got it. Okay.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: You do still have one more question. But I also— I mean, I almost think one of these questions was also kind of just answered.
Justin: Uh… I’m gonna use one more question.
Griffin: Okay.
Duck: Can I have all these nails?
Juno: I mean sure. You’re like, you got a project? You buildin’ a deck? On— Oh, you’re living in an apartment, are you even allowed to build a deck?
Duck: I can’t ask you another question. It’s the rules.
Juno: [laughing] Yeah, you can have the nails, Duck, I guess. I mean it’s, I guess it’s sort of pilfering from the evidence.
Justin: [crosstalk] Can I be honest? [Griffin: Yeah] I kinda thought the virtual camera would pan away after I said “can I have all these nails”.
Griffin: [laughing] Okay, yes it does.
Justin: I didn’t think we needed me to continue to talk about the context in which...
Griffin: Yeah, sure. Okay. Let’s jump to Ned to wrap things up. You are wandering through the woods at night with Billy, your trusty goat friend and companion. What’s this look like?
Clint: Uhm… I was thinking that maybe we were driving?
Griffin: In what?
Clint: In Ned’s Sno-Cat.
Griffin: Okay, I like that.
Clint: It’s the Sno-Cat Tucker-Terra 1643RE. 173 horsepower, got a 67” insulated 8 person cab.
Griffin: That seems like a lot.
Clint: Heated exterior rearview mirror.
Griffin: This is like the fucking truck from The Thing.
Clint: That’s right! But it exists, and it’s mine.
Griffin: Okay, but I’m saying, like, I don’t know that you could drive what it is [Clint: Sure!] through the woods. Okay.
Clint: Sure, you don’t have to follow roads with the sno-cat.
Griffin: All right, that’s fine. You’re driving—
Clint: So we’re driving in— an— you know, Billy periodically will point in some direction and say “Pizza”. And that’s how Ned knows where to go.
Griffin: “Pizza” means east, “Duck” means north. I feel you. All right. Yeah, I think that uh… you all already did the convincing. I’m not gonna make you keep doing that, you already kind of convinced Billy to reveal a little bit about what it is that they are growing.
Clint: And I gave him back his watch. So he looks like Ryan Gosling again.
Griffin: Okay, cool. Ryan Gosling grabs your arm as you are driving and says uh…
Travis: “I love you, Clint. And I’ve always loved you.”
Griffin: “I’ve always loved you.”
Travis: “Kiss me!”
Griffin: He says,
Billy: Duck, Duck, Duck!
Griffin: And like holds up a hand like “stop”.
Clint: Okay, so I bring that big behemoth to a stop.
Griffin: Okay, and the lights are still like on and shining down on the ground. And Billy hops out of the cab. What is Billy like… What is Billy wearing? Did somebody give Billy clothes? We—
Clint: Yes, I’ve got him wearing the Chewbacca outfit.
Griffin: We maybe haven’t answered this yet, and Ned doesn’t necessarily have to be the answerer of it. This is more a group question. But where does...where’s Billy gonna live? You know what, no. I like that scene too much. We’re not gonna just do that out of character. We’ll answer that eventually. I want the “Who gets to put up Billy” scene.
He hops out. And he’s wearing, I guess, the Wookie costume which is nice and warm [Clint: Yeah!] and also probably a little bit wet. And he is just kind of trudging through the snow that’s still on the ground. And every few feet or so you see him stop and brush snow away, looking for the forest floor. And he like beckons you to hop out and look with him.
Clint: So Ned hops out, a little gingerly because he’s still recovering from the horrible stab wound that he suffered—
Griffin: It was more of a slash wound, and go ahead and heal one harm from that because time has passed and I think— it was not a very serious wound—
Clint: Well maybe not to you!
Griffin: —you probably got fixed up in the infirmary also, so go ahead and get rid of one of those harms.
Clint: Okay. And, you know, is kind of following along in the snow behind Billy, kind of looking around— is this— I know Ned would be investigating a mystery, [Griffin: For sure.] I know that’s gotta be what he’s here to do—
Griffin: And because you have, like, a guide, I would definitely give you plus one forward on that roll.
Clint: Okay. But does he want to use it now, or just continue to follow Billy—?
Griffin: Yeah, we can use it to inform this entire scene. Like, that’s how this game works is like, you do this roll and it sort of figures out what the scene’s gonna look like. So I definitely think that rolling it now is the way to go.
Clint: Okay. So we’re gonna Investigate a Mystery—
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: — And… Oh, please, let me have a decent roll.
Travis: You can do it, Dad.
Clint: Thirteen!
Griffin: Good lord, okay.
Clint: Now, that is with— that is with my sharp and with the one point advantage you gave me.
Griffin: Uh, yes.
Travis: So Dad sees everything.
Griffin: I don’t know if we’ve talked about this— I fixed Roll 20 and now it’s working for us in amazing, incredible ways. So that’s a dope roll, so now you get to ask two questions: “What happened here,” “What sort of creature is it,” “What can it do,” “What can hurt it,” “Where did it go,” “What was it gonna do,” “What is being concealed here.” I will tell you that pretty much all of these are on the table because you’re— you are in an important investigation right now.
Clint: I think, um… We have to have something to investigate, right?
Griffin: Uh, yeah, I mean you— you will— the investigation is you going around the woods with Billy and him showing you around. [crosstalk]
Clint: Then I think that the first question would be, “What is being concealed here?”
Griffin: Uh, okay. Yeah, I have an answer to that. You and Billy sort of go around this clearing that you’ve stopped in and you’re just sort of trying to follow his lead, and just brushing dirt out of— or, brushing snow out of the way and looking for something and after a few minutes you do find something. You— your hand hits something solid as you are brushing and it is— it is thick and as you sort of excavate it from the snow— what you see is a root that is just kind of— just barely sort of sticking out of the ground. It almost, like it sort of reached up from underground and then poked back down below. It is— I mean it’s super thick, like you cannot wrap your hand around it. It just looks like sort of a tree root at the base of a tree but it’s like in the middle of nowhere. This tree, like the bark on it, is like bright white. Not like a, uh, not like a white— what is it, like a cedar tree? What— there’s types of trees, that like—
Travis: Birch?
Griffin: A birch? Yes. I don’t know shit about trees, I don’t know why I did this fucking arc, but—
Travis: No, no way!
Griffin: But, yeah, it’s not like that, it is, like, bright white. And you find one of those and Billy like— Billy bleats and calls you over and he found another one. And then you all look around more and you find another one still and what is peculiar is all three of them seem to be pointing in the same direction, almost like you can triangulate if you, like, follow where they are pointing, you can kind of follow the trail of roots that these things have. That is what is being literally concealed here by the snow.
Clint: Can Ned save his next question? Can he follow— can they follow the roots and then ask the question when they arrive wherever they’re gonna arrive?
Griffin: Yes, for sure. Billy starts walking on foot— I think the thicket here is getting a lot thicker, so much so that your Sno-Cat could not necessarily roar over it. Not only that, like it would be tough to follow this path of roots—
Travis: Well Griffin, a thicket’s no trick. The trick is to pick it apart with a stick.
[Clint snorts, giggles]
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: See? I knew that somebody would do Into the Woods.
Griffin: Yes, for sure.
Travis: Yeah, you’re welcome, you’re welcome everyone.
Clint: So Ned activates the security system on the Sno-Cat.
Sno-Cat: Goodnight Ned. Would you like a fresh cup of tea when you return?
[Laughter]
Ned: No— No Michael, no Michael. No— [inaudible]
Sno-Cat: Powering down. Mmmm.
Clint: So Ned’s whacking through the thicket with his sticket and following Billy, who I guess isn’t having quite as much trouble getting through the brush, right?
Griffin: Uh, no. Billy knows the way now. He is taking you through the thicket and you two are just kind of, with some effort, working your way through it and pushing past bushes and brush and squeezing between pine trees and it’s becoming, like, so thick that you can’t— you can barely see the sky through the canopy above. And after a few minutes of working your way through like this, Billy holds out an arm and stops you, and puts a finger up to his mouth and then points just forward, just past the thicket. You are sort of hidden from it but you can see through the brush into the other side. And what you see is another clearing.
[music]
Griffin: Right away you see one of the goatmen holding the shears, the one that you originally had assumed to be dead. He is— he looks awful, he is sort of slumped over this massive tree in the center of this clearing. And sure enough you see, like, all of these white roots leading up to the tree, and they are sort of twisted and gnarled and form this dome at its base, reaching up. And this thing is, like, redwood huge. And it’s not a pine tree, which is bizarre. You can tell this is a cottonwood tree. It is bright white all over. Its bark is bright white. Its leaves are dark black.
Another thing that is sort of strange about this tree is its sort of, like, composition of its branches. There is something sort of symmetrical about the way that they split off. It looks more like a— like a map of a nervous system more than it looks like a cottonwood tree. And this injured goatman is there and is pouring some bags of fertilizer on its roots and trying to tend to it as much as it can, but it looks like it is sort of having a rough time. That is what you see. You still have one question.
Clint: What can it do?
Griffin: Yep. The tree shudders. And as it does so, the goatman and Billy both kind of, like, snap to attention and you start to hear this sickening cracking sound. And as you look up towards the boughs of the tree you see one— still like particularly large bough that hasn’t like split off into this very, very intricate pattern of symmetrical branches. This bough starts to split in half long-wise. It is like it is tearing itself in half. Uh, and as it does so, it releases these spores— what appear to be spores, and as they start falling down on you, you actually realize that they are cottonwood seeds. And you also realize that this entire time, whenever these things have happened, it hasn’t been snow that’s been falling on you, it has been the seeds of this massive tree.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: And as this bough splits and forms another sort of intricate pattern of these symmetrical branches, you hear a cracking sound immediately over your head. You see that an old, dead pine tree has snapped— [beat] and is falling right towards you."

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Griffin: The vision that you see is… a meteor. And it is coming at you faster, and faster.
Minerva: My planet… It, too, was connected to another place. Far flung from our own world. Like your world, ours became… Tethered.
Griffin: And the Interpreter turns back to face you, and gives you a, a little bow, and she says:
Interpreter: Again, my sincere apologies— [echoing] I wish she’d stop coming here. It’s her world’s fault that Sylvain’s dying in the first place.
Griffin: And the words you just heard did not match up to the mouth movements that she made.
This man laughs. And he points at Ned on a television screen, and he says:
Boyd: I know that bloke.
Indrid: Unfortunately, my time here has come to an end.
Aubrey: Wha—
Duck: Can you take this goatman with ya? Take him far away from here and leave him somewhere where he's not gonna do anymore harm.
Griffin: You can tell this is a cottonwood tree.
Ned: What can it do?
Griffin: This bough starts to split in half longwise. It is like it is tearing itself in half. It releases these spores. You hear a cracking sound. An old dead pine tree has snapped and is falling right towards you.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: So I know we had a bit of a cliffhanger ending in the last episode, what with a tree falling over on Ned and Billy. But with your permission, Dad, I wanna jump in sort of in media res? To kind of that parlor room scene? You had a very successful roll and so it felt weird to be like “Yeah that's right, you investigated so good! Here's a fucking tree.”
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Um, so we'll say there was— You and Billy saved each other. You both pushed each other out of the way, it was very very heroic. Um—
[Crosstalk]
Clint: What can we—
Travis: Now save e— wait. Saved each other like spiritually, Griffin? Do you think like they found each other, and like they made each other whole again?
Griffin: Yeah they knocked each other out of the way, and then as they were laying in the snow they were like “Do you… d’you take the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ into your—""
Clint: We have to act it out, we don't want one of those cheap cliffhanger resolutions.
Griffin: Alright. Let’s act it out.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: [Doing sound effects of the tree falling] Crack, eerrrr…
Ned: [dramatically] Look out, Billy!!
Billy: [bleating] Pizza!
Ned: Yikes!
Justin: Can I say, that was thrilling. I actually, I'm—
Griffin: I’m glad that we did that.
Clint: Yeah.
Travis: Put some foley in there and some…
Clint: Trust my dramatic senses.
Griffin: For sure. So the three of y—
Justin: Scott Foley in there.
[Laughter]
Griffin: Yeah. The three of you are sitting in the Pine Guard HQ with Barclay and Mama, all around a table in the center of your space down there. There are some maps and books sort of spread out across the table that Barclay has brought down from Mama’s office. And you are all reconvening after your investigation and, uh… Ned, you're probably still a little out of breath from escaping the forest, so I think this, like, just happened. And I wanna do like the— The Parlor Room scene of you all summarizing what you've learned and coming up with the plan of attack.
One order of business though, before we do that. Ned, after you escaped the woods and everybody got back together to sort of come up with a plan. What— Where’s Billy? What did you do with Billy?
Clint: Uhm, Billy is going to stay at the Cryptonomica.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: It just felt right, I’ve given him like a little jumper. A custodian’s coveralls thing. And it’s got his name on it.
Griffin: Okay.
Aubrey: How did you do that so quickly?
Ned: Ah, it was used. I got it at the Goodwill.
Griffin: Kirby was likely—
Aubrey: So you found— wait hold on. You found an embroidered jumpsuit, from someone named Billy that had put their jumpsuit…
Griffin: Yeah, it's a pretty common name.
Justin: It’s a pretty common name, to be fair, Trav.
Travis: I mean, I guess.
Griffin: I imagine Kirby was very confused when you dropped off this Ryan Gosling at the store?
Clint: Yeah, but he's a huge Gosling fan, so it really worked out. I mean he—
Justin: It's as close as he's gonna get.
Travis: “Kirby, Ryan Gosling got hit on the head really hard and can only say “Pizza"" and “Duck"".”
[Griffin laughs]
Travis: “You're gonna need to take care of him. We're in a full blown Overboard situation.”
Griffin: Okay, uh, that’s fine. So, Mama is standing over the table, she’s still on crutches sort of recovering from the injuries sustained while she was exploring Sylvain, last arc. She’s also got a cold, it seems like? She’s doing a lot of hackin’ and sneezin’. But she’s trying to keep it together as you all sort of wrap up this hunt!
Griffin: And Mama says,
Mama: A’right, I admit I've been a little out of the loop on this one. So we got somethin’s causin’ deadly accidents all around Kepler. What do we know?
Aubrey: It has to do with, like, not just accidents but, like, changing the future? I don’t know how much you know about the multiverse, Mama, but uh—
Mama: I know more than you would believe.
Duck: Somebody get a whiteboard in here.
Aubrey: Okay, so every decision we make. Spiderweb, spiderweb, spiderweb, explanation, explanation, explanation. And that's what’s going on.
Duck: Hey, everybody. Lets just sit down, everybody sit down and watch this DVD of The Butterfly Effect.
[Clint and Griffin laugh]
Griffin: It’s Ashton Kutcher's magnum opus.
Duck: Now, are we doin’ that?
Griffin: Yeah, you take a break to watch the whole movie, The Butterfly Effect. It is not as good as you remember, and you don’t remember it being great.
Duck: Alright everybody, now listen. This isn’t important, but if y’all do want to follow it up with Butterfly Effect 2, or B 2, as we in the… call it…
Griffin: You just leave the “Effects” letter off of it? [laughs]
Duck: What? No, bee-ee makes “be” [Griffin: Oh, I got you.] so it’s “Be.” — bee-ee 2— “Be 2.” [Griffin: Gotcha.] So Be 2, none of the returning, uh, sort of performers, [laughs] are in this one, but, uh, it is better—
Aubrey: Oh, they couldn’t even get Ethan Suplee? He’s so good!
Duck: Here’s the great thing, here’s the best thing about Butterfly Effect 2, it is better than Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations, so you can, uh—
Mama: There’s a third one. Damn!
Duck: That is a high— high praise, high praise.
Mama: Okay, but, do we know what this thing is?
Aubrey: The movie?
Mama: The thing that’s changing— that’s causing— I need everybody to sort of focus up, we are talking about a thing that has killed people.
Ned: There is a very large tree and as it grows, it changes the future— Every time a branch shoots off from this tree, it’s a different timeline, and I think it’s using that to create all these new… timelines.
Aubrey: You know, when we say it out loud, like, we fought a giant thing that had incorporated a bunch of different animals into it and like, a water spirit that could be anywhere there was water, and this is a tree.
Mama: Yeah, I mean, it’s just a tree, let’s— why don’t you all go nip this in the— I mean we do know, do we know where it is?
Aubrey: Nip it in the bud. Finish the sentence Mama.
Mama: Nip it in the… I saw where it was going and I didn’t wanna— I wanna kill this thing and I knew if I went down that road it would be another fifteen minutes of tree jokes.
Duck: [crosstalk] It happened organically, you shouldn’t feel ashamed of that.
Mama: Alright, well, do we know where it is though?
Ned: Yes. I have the location courtesy of my friend Billy. And I’m sure if he— if we just follow the tracks of the Sno-Cat, we’d be able to get back to it.
Mama: Now wait a minute. Who’s Billy? Did you tell somebody else about what we do here? Ned?
Duck: Ah, shit. [Ned: Shit, dammit.] Goddammit Ned! [Ned: Sorry.] Goddammit. Alright, listen, well this one’s my fuckup, so I— I guess I’ll just— let me own this one so Ned doesn’t get us in deeper. Um… So, I rescued… [clicks tongue] the plant has some goats that work for it, real— like, professional goats—
Aubrey: Business goats.
Duck: Business goats, and I saved one of their lives, um… and, then it became very sort of spiritually indebted to me, and then Aubrey made it talk.
Aubrey: Yeah, that, that one’s on me.
Duck: That one’s on Aubrey for sure. She made it talk sort of, but it’s like, it’s not a monster— it’s chill, I guess is what I’m trying to get at.
Aubrey: Yeah, on a scale of 1 to 10, I think we’ve established it’s like an 8.
Duck: Yeah, it’s just like, it’s really chill.
Griffin: Um, this whole time— this whole time you’re saying this, Barclay is like standing behind Mama and making just a grim face and like shaking his head “no” like—
Barclay: [muffled] No, what are you doing.
Griffin: And sure enough, Mama is sort of stunned, like literally mouth agape listening to what you’re saying, she says—
Mama: You saved one of these things? You brought one of these things back to Amnesty Lodge?
Duck: I knew you wouldn’t understand, um…
Mama: No, I, I understand real good, Duck, I understand what you’ve, [laughs in disbelief] what you’ve done, you have violated the safety of this place that I’ve worked so hard to protect. You have befriended an abomination, Duck?
Aubrey: No, Mama, if I may, I know how it sounds all kind of laid out like this, but it happened, like, in sequence. It was the kind of thing like the thing was injured, Duck brought it back here to question it to find out what was going on, [Duck: Yeah.] like had it chained down, we couldn’t talk to it ‘cause it didn’t understand English, so that’s why I made it talk, and then—
Mama: And now you’re best buddies, gonna come to your Christmas party, is that what you’re telling me?
Aubrey: Well he’s helped! We wouldn’t have found the tree without him, we wouldn’t, [Duck: Yep.] he helped us fight off other bad creatures, so like—
Ned: And you know what, bad creatures, you know, Mama, you basically run a hostel for sasquatches and vampires.
Aubrey: No offense, Barclay.
Griffin: Oh she is not, she is not having any of of— She pounds her fucking fist on the table and she says:
Mama: Ned, they are, the abominations aren’t— they are different from the people who have found their way over here from Sylvain. Do you get that? These— the abominations, I’ve been fighting them a lot longer than y’all. They don’t just deal in claws and fangs and knives. They can get in your head. This thing is trying to worm its way into your inner circle so that when you’re most vulnerable he can— he can take you out! I— this thing, they are capable of playing mental games, too. And you all are just playing it fast and loose with it!
Aubrey: He mostly just says “Pizza”, I’m not really worried—
Duck: [crosstalk] Yeah, he only says “Pizza” and “Duck”.
Ned: And he has helped us quite a bit.
Aubrey: I’m not super worried about his mental acuity.
Duck: Do you wanna— hey Mama, do you wanna talk to him?
Mama: [laughing] Uh, yeah, why don’t you bring him around and I’ll have myself a nice chat with your friend.
Duck: Now, I under— that— listen, I’m no dunce, that, that’s, you’re gonna kill him, I don’t, I… nice try. Listen, he’s safe… -ly stored somewhere. Can we focus on this mean tree? And then move on from there?
Griffin: She says, um…
Mama: We are going to need to deal—
Griffin: And as she’s talking there’s a knock at the cellar door and you hear Jake Coolice shouting from outside and he says—
Jake: Hey, uh, Mama? Everyone? You’re… you’re gonna wanna come see this.
Griffin: And, uh, he opens up the door and Mama kinda, like, sighs, and looks down for a bit and then follows Barclay up and up the stairs and out of the Pine Guard Haven. Do you all follow or…? I assume so. [Travis: Yeah.] This is my least favorite part of playing roleplaying games. Um, you—
Travis: No, you know what, we stay in the basement [Griffin: Yeah, exactly.] and let the action unfold outside.
Griffin: Um, you all emerge from the cellar and you see just an assembly of Amnesty Lodge residents standing on the porch. There’s Dani and Moira and Agent Stern. They are all just sort of observing the scene outside. The cottonwood snow that you sort of discovered, Ned, that has sort of fallen every time that there’s been one of these accidents, it is falling in sheets, and it is not just localized in your immediate vicinity either as it kinda has been whenever these accidents have happened. Through the trees lining the access road out to, like, the main drag of cliffside and then, you know, looking over the precipice of the cliff down into the heart of Kepler, this false snow is just everywhere. It is all over Kepler. And Mama says,
Mama: If… if this is following the pattern that means something big is about to happen and we have no idea what it’s gonna be.
Duck: Well, listen, let’s get in the fucking truck and let’s go kill this tree [Aubrey: Yup.] before it’s got a chance to do anything.
Aubrey: I’m fully on board with that.
Duck: I have a suspicion I would say from talking to Juno. I think that— you ever heard that like copper in a tree can kill it? Like even like a single copper nail in a tree can kill it?
Mama: I didn’t think that was actually true.
Duck: Well, I didn’t think Bigfoot existed, but here we all are, huh? [Clint laughs] It doesn’t, like… in our sort of understanding of things, like, in the, I mean… I’m a forest ranger, right? It doesn’t. It doesn’t. It’s a legend, like—
Aubrey: You are?
Duck: Yeah, okay. The legends… I mean, there’s a lot of legends we found out in the past few months been true. So I think that this thing might abide by those rules. They had to come from somewhere, right? And if it didn’t come from reality, where might it have come from?
Aubrey: So, just to, if I may, extrapolate here, what you’re saying, Duck, is that we need to take a hammer and a nail and just walk up to the tree and hammer a nail into it.
Duck: Uh… Yeah. I, now that you say it, kinda with that, a little bit of that tone, it does, it’s a little… Yeah, I understand what you’re saying, but um, I—
Aubrey: Then again, I guess, you know, now that I say it, what are we worried about? The tree running away while we try to do it? Like, okay? Maybe?
Duck: I mean I guess we try that and, I mean, I wish I had a bigger copper somethin. That’s my dream, is like a copper nail gun, or um—
Ned: [drawn out] Iiiiiiii… You know I’ve got nail guns at the Cryptonomica from where we’ve been building all the sets for, you know, Saturday Night Dead.
Duck: Okay…
Griffin: That is, um, that’s a very handy— I would say you have nail gun at the Cryptonomica. I don’t know that you have five nail guns for, uh…
Ned: Well, that’ll cover me. [Griffin: Yeah] Good.
Duck: And when I say nail gun, I don’t actually— the problem with nail guns y’all, is that it’s not like— it’s not like Home Alone taught us. Nail guns don’t really like pull the trigger and they fire a nail across the room, right?
Aubrey: Well, hold on. Actually, you know, I did some high school theater, that should be surprising to no one. And um, there’s some… there’s some workarounds for that that you can do.
Duck: Some mods.
Aubrey: Yeah, it’s not great, but you know, as far as like danger goes, but you can, you can, uh, trick those safeties.
Ned: Yeah. And, not only that but I can— this one does do that because Kirby has, well, a rather unusual buttcheek wound that would probably come from us horsing around with the nail gun.
Griffin: [Incredulously/Appalled] Having a nail fight? With your employee Kirby?
Travis: To pull back the curtain for everyone at home, I just gave an explanation of how we could rig it, but Dad was insistent that he wanted to give Kirby a butt wound.
Griffin: Yeah, with a nail fight he did. Okay.
Duck: Alright, here’s the plan. I picked up a bunch of nails from when I went to visit Juno. We’ll go grab the nail gun from Ned’s place. We’ll try the nail gun. I’m having a hard time imagining it working but let’s give it a shot. Backup plan, I have a sword that I think would love to do a little Paul Bunyan action so we could give that a try if all else fails. And then Aubrey’s got magic, so.
Ned: She’s got the fire, she’s got the fire.
Duck: Well, we’re not gonna be using any fire, thanks very much—
Ned: Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, don’t tie her hands—
Aubrey: I can control it!
Duck: I’m— I’ll tie her hands, we’re not gonna be tossing around a bunch of fireballs in a fucking forest, guys, sorry, they do revoke your license for that [Clint laughs] as a forest ranger if you bring a magic person to light trees on fire, guys.
Ned: Well, the—
Aubrey: Okay.
Ned: Last resort.
Duck: No! God, no! Listen, that’s no resort. Not applicable. I have to go to work tomorrow, alright? [Griffin laughs] No way.
Aubrey: Okay, we’ll call it plan Z.
Duck: There’s plan, no! That’s it, no!
Ned: Z two.
Duck: This has— There’s other things that kills trees, alright? It doesn’t has to be the one thing that also sets other cool ass trees on fire.
Aubrey: Got it. [Griffin: Alright.] Got it. I won’t unless I absolutely have to.
Duck: I’m done. I’m done. I’m out.
Griffin: Alright, regulators mount up. You swing by the Cryptonomica, you grab the nail gun, do you also grab Billy while you are there or are you leaving him in the safety of the Cryptonomica? Up to you.
Aubrey: On the one hand, I would appreciate the help, but on the other hand, this tree seems to have some kind of sway over the goat people, and I don’t want to have to fight Billy.
Duck: Yeah, mmm...yeah, I don’t want to bring Billy.
Griffin: Okay, you all leave Billy behind. He looks at you actually as you swing by and [Clint: Aww.] kind of cocks his head as he sees you leaving without him and he goes—
Billy: Duck?
Duck: Uh, pizza. We’ll pizza right back.
Griffin: He nods solemnly in complete understanding.
Travis: Of course. I leave him a twenty in case he wants to order some pizza.
Justin: Can you even imagine that conversation? “Uh, hello, this is Dominos.” “Pizza!” “Okay, good. What kind of—” “Duck!” “You want duck pizza? That’s foul, no way, we don’t sell that.” “Pizza!”
Travis: That’s fowl! That’s fowl, he says.
Justin: Okay, great, good. [crosstalk]
Ned: Kirby, show him a movie. Show him, um—
Aubrey: The Notebook.
Ned: —Show him one of his own movies.
Duck: We got BE 2 all loaded up in there, all ready [crosstalk]
Griffin: Kirby says,
Kirby: Oh fuck yeah! BE 2, that’s my favorite, it’s way better than BE 3.
{Music from 19:26-19:42}
Griffin: We’ve done a couple hunts now, and this is sort of a different approach, right? Because you all— this thing is not moving, it is a tree, you know where it is. It is not like you are trying to lure it somewhere and then get the drop on it so it can’t escape. It’s not going to escape, it’s a fucking tree. So I guess this is like a different kind of advantage for you all, like what is your approach as you all make your way into the forest? Ned, you have no problem following the tracks of the Sno-cat. What’s like your— what’s your strategy as you make your way into this sort of encounter?
Ned: We need to come from upwind because they can smell fear.
Justin: Um, I think we’re taking it real careful. We know where it is, and I’m not saying we’re, like, crawling, but we’re not taking a lot of unnecessary risks getting to it.
Griffin: Uh, do you want to— why don’t you Read a Bad Situation, right? Like, that sounds like what you are describing here.
Justin: Okay, that’s fair. Uh, and that is a roll of… what rolls against Read a Bad Situation?
Griffin: Uh, Sharp?
Clint: Sharp.
Griffin: Nice, Jesus!
Travis: Damn.
Griffin: That is a twelve. You all are on a hot streak. I hope that it does not end when you are crossing swords with this big tree. Oh no, I spoiled the fact that they have so many swords. Okay, so on a ten-plus you hold three, holy shit. You get to ask three questions and every time you act on the answers you get plus one ongoing while in information is relevant. “What’s my best way in,” “What’s my best way out,” “Are there dangers we haven’t noticed,” “What’s the biggest threat,” “What’s most vulnerable to me,” and “What’s the best way to protect the victims.”
Justin: Well, let’s see which ones I can answer before— our in and out, I don’t know, dangers we haven’t noticed, I don’t know, biggest threat, the tree, I guess? What’s most vulnerable to me, the tree. What’s the best way to protect the victims? I don’t think there are victims. So I would say, what’s the best way in?
Griffin: As you approach the tree, you do sort of get a lay of the land. You see— first you see the injured goat man, the one that Aubrey sort of flung into a tree and just really messed him up, he is— and Ned, you saw this goat man sort of crawling around when you first found the tree. Right now he is laying among the roots of the tree. The tree is sort of growing out of this gnarled dome of roots. It seems like it is, like, semi-absorbed into the roots. Like, he has just been sort of sucked into them and he is not moving.
Justin: Who?
Travis: The goat person?
Griffin: The goat person, yes.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: You also see— you would just see this, I don’t necessarily think that you need a question for this. You see another goat man. He is holding on with both hands to a chain and dragging something through the snow, and you see that what he is dragging through the snow is Indrid Cold. [Travis gasps] Uh, who is bound up in this chain, and the goat—
Travis: The Mothman!
Griffin: The mothman. And this goat man, shovel goat man, brings Indrid over, also to the root of the tree, sort of ties the chain around one of the roots and secures him. Indrid has got a black eye, his hair is matted a bit, you can see a little bit of blood there, but otherwise he is just kind of staring calmly into the middle distance. As you sort of get the lay of the land, right, you see these two other goat men— Duck, I think you get the line you can come at this clearing from where they’re not necessarily going to see you as you make your first approach. So that’s what I will give you for best way in.
Clint: Has Indrid got his glasses on?
Griffin: Uh, yes Indrid has his glasses on.
Clint: Well, I’m asking because I was wondering if he was in Mothman form.
Griffin: If he wasn’t he would be in Mothman— yeah he’s not, he’s got his glasses on.
Justin: Okay, um…
Ned: We have to save the Mothman.
Aubrey: Yes.
Duck: Yeah, that’s a whole tourism industry right there for Point Pleasant—
Ned: Yeah.
Duck: —That I won’t let go down the tubes.
Justin: My next question is—
Travis: We don’t want it to become Point So-So, you know what I mean?
Justin: Yeah, yeah. How do I help the victims?
Griffin: You realize that the chain is not padlocked or anything like that. The best way for you to protect the victim would simply be to put yourself between him and the goat man. Both of the goat men’s instruments, the shovel and the shears, are still there. The best way to protect these— to protect Indrid is to, you know, release him and keep the attention off of him so that the goat men don’t go after him.
Justin: Okay. Lastly… What’s the biggest threat?
Griffin: This is a tough one.
Justin: That’s what I figured.
Griffin: Um, there— so this thing splits off its branches and every time it does so it shoots out these spores, and— again, it splits off in these symmetrical patterns and right now, you see— you see trees— you know— Duck knows a tree.
Justin: Thank you.
Griffin: This one—
Travis: Duck knows trees.
Griffin: There’s a lot of unusual things about this tree but like, by far the strangest thing about it is it has started to almost split in half entirely. It’s a very tall tree so there’s a good ten feet of trunk and then above that it seems like the rest of the trunk has started to just like peel away. Its two halves have just peeled away from each other, and in that gap just spores are shooting up like crazy. It looks like a snow machine. And as it has done so, the rest of the branches have fanned out completely, and it’s almost like it is forming like a perfect circle of branches and black leaves all around the tree. That is by far— you, Ned— I think you, Duck, in particular, you see that and know that it is extremely bad.
Duck: Ah, shit. Alright. Listen. Guys. I’ve had a lot of insights in the past no seconds and, uh, I’m, um, I’m well prepared to dole out a plan. Here’s what I’m thinking. Ned, you take care of the tree. Get the nail gun, blast it. Blaze it with the nails, okay?
Ned: Okay?
Duck: Open fire.
Ned: Good. From the cover of the brush, probably, I think, yeah.
Duck: Uh, I mean, if you think you’re a good enough shot there.
Ned: I think it’s worth the risk, yeah.
Duck: Alright. Aubrey, I want you to take care of the spores, okay? Does that make sense? Do you think you can handle that? It seems like that would be a good thin— something you would be good at disrupting.
Aubrey: Sure? Yeah. Okay?
Duck: Alright. I’m gonna— I’m gonna rescue the Mothman.
Griffin: Okay. That’s—
Duck: And maybe they’ll rename Point Pleasant after me. In answer of my—
Griffin: Point Ducktown.
Duck: Point Duck—
Aubrey: Pleasant— it’s Pleasant Duck—
Duck: Probably Duckburg, thank you.
[Laughter]
Griffin: Fair. Okay, who’s— are you doing these things simultaneously, or are you trying to get— what’s, what’s—
Duck: Now we’re gonna do them as soon as I say go.
Griffin: Okay.
[Silence]
Duck: Go.
Griffin: [Laughing] Alright.
Duck: And be quiet! So we can get a stealthy approach if possible.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. I think you can all get a stealthy approach. Ned, are you really hiding in the brush, and gonna try and take pot-shots at this thing with your copper nails, or was that a goof about how cowardly you are?
Clint: It is kinda how cowardly, but he realizes at some point he’s gonna have to emerge into the open and start shooting away at it.
Griffin: I like that. Ned, okay, you are— how close are you getting to this thing? Are you taking the stealth approach through this route that Duck discovered?
Clint: Well it’s not like it has eyes, right? So, assuming it can’t see me is not a good idea. I’m gonna—
Griffin: There are two goat men that could ostensibly see you.
Clint: Oh, right. Oh, what the hell. I’m gonna get within about ten feet of the trunk of the big trunk.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah. Then, Act Under Pressure.
Clint: Act Under Pressure, that would be Cool. And…
Justin: [crosstalk] It would be.
Travis: [crosstalk] That would be cool.
Justin: That would be cool.
Griffin: It would be cool if you got a good roll here.
Justin: It would be cool if you did it with a lot of— add a lot of preamble.
Griffin: Yowza.
Justin: Woah, hocha pocha!
Griffin: Ned got a six, however because you were on— you know, following this sneaky path that Duck pulled out for you and you have not been, sort of, discovered, you get a plus one on that, which brings it up to a seven.
Travis: So it is a mixed success!
Griffin: It is a mixed success. Uh, I will give you a… um… Price to Pay. You walk towards this thing and you start— you said you’re peppering it, you’re just, like, rapid firing some nails into the side of it?
Clint: Let’s see what one nail does— because Duck did say that one nail would do it— so let’s see what one nail does before I start just holding the trigger down.
Griffin: Okay. you fire a nail off and you are definitely close enough that it does not have a problem connecting with the tree. It— you see it sort of jam into the tree. The whole scene is sort of covered in moonlight, right? It’s always close to full moon whenever you guys are doing it. And you see the nail go into the tree. And as the nail sticks into the tree, you see it just instantly, sort of reflexively start shuddering. And—
Ned: It worked! I’ll be damned.
Griffin: And as it does so, you hear this really loud and very unsettling rattling noise coming from the tree, uh, and—
Duck: Hell yeah, Ned, you nailed it!
Ned: Ah!
Duck: Nailed it man, we win!
Griffin: And you see the bark on the trunk sort of around where the nail went in, it just like starts to crack, and—
Duck: Aw, nice, dude!
Griffin: —and fall apart and this huge chunk of bark just sort of sloughs off the side of the tree. And a fairly small branch just, like, snaps in half and as you pull the trigger this time, the nail gun is jammed.
Ned: What?!
Duck: God! [laughs]
Aubrey: Dip.
Griffin: And now I think everybody kind of— the scene knows that you all are there, however you all established that these things are trying to kind of happen simultaneously, so. Aubrey or Duck, who wants to go next?
Aubrey: Well Duck has said that I’m not allowed to use fire…
Duck: Mh-hm.
Travis: I am going to… Use Magic!
Griffin: Okay. To accomplish what?
Travis: Don’t know yet. I mean, I have a thing that’s “Trap a specific person, minion, or monster...”
Griffin: I would give you that.
Travis: Yeah?
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. I mean, this is part of the monster's effect.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: This is like, it’s a tree, so it’s pretty fucking trapped already, so like, this is how it is affecting the world. I think that that would totally apply here.
Travis: Okay, Aubrey whispers—
Aubrey: I would like to contain the spores?
Travis: And like, casts.
Griffin: [Laughs] You hear a voice say, “That’s a weird one man, okay.”
Aubrey: I know! Listen, I know.
Griffin: Uh… you don’t actually hear that. Okay, so—
Travis: Aw.
Griffin: I guess, roll plus— are you doing this— you have to tell me, like, what that actually looks like before we try to roll, and— like how are you trying to contain the spores?
Travis: Like, I’ve done wind before, and so I think I’m trying to like, create some kind of like, the wind is blowing them back to the tree?
Griffin: Uh… yeah, okay. You can— sort of creating a whirlwind that traps them around the tree—
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: So it can’t escape?
Travis: Yeah—
Griffin: Okay, that’s cool.
Travis: —a swirl rather than it blowing out into the world.
Griffin: For sure, I like that. Okay.
Travis: And do I get one forward because of our sneaky plan?
Griffin: No, you get one forward because of Duck identifying that the spores are super dangerous.
Travis: Okay, great, well I’m just putting that into the roll, so I just want to be sure.
Griffin: Alright, that’s a nine. A nine is a mixed success, so it’s going to have a Glitch. Uh, “The effect is weakened,” “It’s of short duration,” “You take one harm ignore armor,” “It draws immediate unwelcome attention,” or “It has an problematic side effect.
Travis: Let’s go with problematic side effect.
Griffin: Um, okay. You create this whirlwind and the spores that were shooting out of the huge rift in the middle of the tree - and also the spores that have started to just sort of emanate out of it, as Ned shoots the nail into it - they do start to swirl around the tree. It’s like it’s creating a localized snow globe effect, right where you are. As a side effect, the tree is now going to be harder to attack at range. Just because it is, like, it is sort of shrouded in this seed-storm. Uh, which brings us to Duck.
Duck: Hey. Indrid, are you with us?
Griffin: Uh, there is a goat man, like, right there with Indrid? I think that before you can—
Justin: Is he looking at Indrid, or what’s the deal?
Griffin: Yeah, he definitely has his back to you.
Justin: I am going to… pull out Beacon and attack the chain that’s binding Indrid.
Griffin: Uh, okay. And there is a goat man who is, like, right there, so if you do this, and don’t do anything with the goat man, the goat man is gonna- is gonna getcha.
Justin: Yeah, that’s fine.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I need one action’s worth of things to do.
Griffin: I feel you. Then this is going to be an Act Under Pressure, because there is pressure in the form of this uh, enemy goat.
Justin: Mmkay. So that is Cool. And am I act— ah, I’m gonna give myself plus one on this—
Griffin: Yes, because you identified how to save—
Justin: Because I’m acting on the information—
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Oh God. It’s still just an eight.
Griffin: Uh, okay. This is a Hard Choice I’m gonna give you.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: You get the drop on the goat man and as he’s watching over Indrid after having just sort of tied him up to the roots. All the goat man sees is your shadow as you lift Beacon up over your head. And as you are sort of frozen in this moment, you recall a memory.
{Music 34:04- 34:11}
Griffin: Duck, you are eighteen again. It’s been several months since Minerva first appeared to you that night, awakening you with this vision of a house fire and this apocalyptic firestorm outside. And since then you have rebuffed her offers of power and a heroic destiny. And in this memory it’s nighttime and you are in the abandoned closed down clothing retailer Altizer’s. Your friends have cleared the floor in the main showroom and set up an audience of beat up mannequins as you and your friends play field hockey in the store. Juno Devine, your current co-worker, is there, and she is playing goalie, defending a goal that’s sort of posted up in the Men’s Casual Wear department. And— is it like a fairly big group of friends? You described this scene in the last episode and I’m wondering how rowdy it got.
Justin: I mean we have close friends, but it’s more of like a hangout where a lot of people sort know that it’s there, you know what I mean?
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: It’s sort of like a defacto hang.
Griffin: A little Road House situation, [Justin: Thank you, yes.] but with drugs and hockey?
Justin: Yeah, exactly.
Griffin: Alright, I like that.
Justin: And by the way, Road House did have plenty of drugs and hockey, it was just behind the scenes.
Griffin: [laughs] That’s fair. Uh, okay, you are breaking away towards Juno and she is trying to defend your shot and she says—
Juno: Well shit, Duck, you ever gonna use that stick to take a shot or are you just planning on doing the foxtrot with it all night?
Duck: Well, Juno, I was planning on shoving it up your ass, but I guess if I have to make a choice—
Justin: And I slap the ball into the net. And it’s the most amazing shot.
[Travis and Griffin laugh]
Griffin: The mannequins come to life and applaud—
Travis: And one of those mannequins goes on to write Mighty Ducks and includes the slap shot in it based on what they saw that night.
Griffin: They’re all Kim Cattrall. Um, okay! Juno looks sort of disappointed, and then, like, takes her gloves off and pulls a cigarette out from behind her ear and lights it up because you’re all a bunch of, ya know, rowdy bad kids. [Justin: Yeah.] As you turn around to sort of like accept your accolades from the other players, Minerva is just like, right in your face. Just inches in front of you and—
Duck: Jesus!
Griffin: Juno just sort of exhales and says:
Juno: You— You alright there, Duck?
Duck: Yeah, I was just thinking about how much I love The Offspring. And I got really excited.
[Griffin laughs loudly]
Griffin: Minerva says,
Minerva: Duck Newton! Participating in a bit of competitive recreation, I see. This could serve you well, it could develop your agility, as you square off against your foe in a may-lay!
Justin: [laughs] Uh… and I just nod.
[laughter]
Griffin: She says,
Minerva: Duck Newton, please do not ignore me! Tonight is an auspicious occasion! I require your undivided attention.
Duck: Ay, I’m gonna go take a leak y’all, be right back.
Clint: [laughs]
Justin: And I’ll go, I’ll go into the, where we always, where everybody takes a leak, and that’s in the former housewares department. And like, everybody takes leaks here.
[laughter]
Griffin: Jesus!
Justin: As I’m saying it— I realize as I’m saying it, it’s the worst!
Griffin: It’s the most horrible thing—
Justin: You know what, actually, there are probably bathrooms! [breaks out into laughter]
Travis: Yeah!
Griffin: No we can’t retcon it, you are just taking a leak, [crosstalk] on the floor.
Justin: [crosstalk] It’s a department store Griffin! Of course there are bathrooms!
Travis: Does the housewares department have like, display toilets for sale?
Justin: That’s the joke, but there probably are bathrooms there.
Griffin: You are bad kids, you are peeing on the floor like a bunch of dogs. You are doing that and Minerva says:
Minerva: Oh, I…I will give you some privacy.
Griffin: As you just sort of are pissing on the floor like a house cat—
Justin: No I don’t need to actually piss! I was just trying to get away from them.
Travis: It was subterfuge!
Justin: Yeah, thank you!
Griffin: Ok, you are not pissing, but it’s everywhere, and Minerva says:
Minerva: I’m sorry to interrupt, it seemed like you were having a jovial time!
Duck: Yeah, I’m just trying to like, fucking chill! What’s up?
Minerva: Uh…
Duck: I told you I’m not interested, move on!
Griffin: She says,
Minerva: I understand that, but I have one last offer for you.
Griffin: And outside of the store, I think everybody inside the shop freezes as headlights creep across the drawn blinds of the store, and you hear a vehicle come to a stop just outside of where you are. And you hear Juno shout from the other room, she’s like,
Juno: Aw shit, it’s the cops! Everybody get down!
Griffin: And you hear a car door open and you hear footsteps coming out of the vehicle. And you hear this faint sort of like metallic crunching noise? And then you hear someone sort of exhale a deep sigh, and Minerva says:
Minerva: Duck Newton! It would behoove you to go outside before any of your friends are able to see what’s happening out there.
Duck: Why, what’s happening?
Minerva: [smug] You’ll see!
Griffin: She’s like, so pumped. She’s like, so excited.
Duck: God dammit, alright! Fine, fine.
Griffin: As you step outside, you just see this car pull away. It’s a cab that is pulling off into the distance, it’s sort of getting off the main drag and onto the highway out of town.
Clint: Kepler’s one cab!
Griffin: [laughs] One cab. And several feet from the entrance to the store, there’s like this grassy little cut-out in the sidewalk where a tree is growing in the middle of the town, there’s a few of them sort of peppered across the main drag, sort of giving the downtown area of Kepler a bit of greenery. But in this little small patch of grass, you see a shape glistening in the moonlight. It is a sword. It is a long, straight, thin blade with a leatherbound hilt, and this intricately forged guard that appears to be in the shape of a mouth. And Minerva suddenly disappears and reappears right behind the blade and gestures towards it. And she says:
Minerva: I know your hesitance, Duck Newton! You have voiced it clearly, and I would not deign to ignore it. But you have been chosen, Duck, and that is a decision that cannot be reversed. I would ask of you this, take up your blade, take up your fated instrument. And if you do not feel the call to pursue your destiny, I shall take my leave until you have grown to accept the tasks appointed to you.
Duck: Well, I am of course honored, uh, [laughs] I mean I’ll keep the sword! That seems pretty kickass, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to— you want me to go kill the rest of the MacLeod clan? Then, I’ll be the only one? Remember the— there can only be one of us? Have you seen that movie? There can be only one?
Minerva: I mean, I have not seen any of your Earth—
Duck: I haven’t seen it either. It’s like a sword guy, I don’t know! It seems kind of dumb to me but I’ll keep the sword, hell yeah.
Justin: I pick it up.
Duck: [imitates the sound of a sword being slashed around] Look at me! [continues making sword slashing sounds]
Minerva: How— how does it feel?
Duck: Uh, pretty kickass, yeah! I mean I’m not gonna go like, stab Dracula or whatever the fuck, but it’s alright.
Minerva: But you could! You have the power to stab, you said Dracula?
Beacon: Mineeeervaaa, instruct this beef boy to unhand me, please.
Griffin: How does Duck feel about that?
Justin: He’s shocked, he drops it on the ground, like, what the fuck.
Beacon: Oh, excellent! Another skilled combatant.
{Music: 41:30-41:48}
Griffin: This is the offer I have for you. You are going to be able to swing down with enough force to cut the chain and free Indrid, and you are going to be able to do it because you got the drop on this goatman, your movement is so swift you’re going to be able to do it. The price to pay is... Beacon will be damaged.
Justin: Um…
Griffin: Not broken! I won’t take that from you. But there will be some damage to the blade. You are swinging metal down onto hard metal. You can get through it, but the durability of Beacon will be worn down, a little bit.
Justin: Is this a choice I’m having to make? [Griffin: Yep!] Are you making me make this choice?
Griffin: I am making you make this choice.
Justin: I think it’s what I would have done. Yeah. That’s what I would do.
Griffin: You swing the blade down, and there is certainly some resistance as you chop the chain sort of against these hard roots, but you get through it. And the goatman sort of looks up at you in surprise, and you’re definitely going to have to deal with that soon. Indrid sort of-
Travis: (mimicking goat voice) Pizza?
Griffin: This one does not talk and say pizza. Indrid sort of instinctively tries to roll out of the way.
Justin: Okay, in that moment, I need one mo— I get one more acksh— I want-
Griffin: [laughs] Okay!
Justin: When the goatman turns around and looks at me, I rear back my fist, [Griffin: Mhmm.] and I punch Indrid in the face.
Griffin: Okay...? Yeah, I’m not going to make you roll for that—
Justin: To knock his glasses off.
Griffin: Oh, okay! You punch Indrid in the face and he says:
Indrid: [alarmed] Duck, what are you—
Griffin: And then, he becomes the mothman. And I think, seeing this- A lot of things just happen in front of this goatman very quickly, and he starts to crab walk backwards away, just for a moment, until he sort of composes himself. So now you have put some distance between you and the goatman.
Duck: Fly, Indrid, fly!
Griffin: Indrid gets to his feet and he grabs you by the shoulders and he says:
Indrid: Duck, Duck I— my visions— there’s a hole… in the ground. There’s a— a large hole in the ground in the middle of Kepler and… buildings have fallen into it. I see cars, I see twisted wreckage and bodies—
Duck: No, listen, listen, we don’t have a lot of time. I’ve, I’ve seen it too, I know, it fucking sucks! I saw it in a dream, and I thought it was just that: anxiety dreams or whatever, but I— now I— apparently it was a prophecy. I get it. This one I’ve seen too, and I swear to God, Indrid, we’re not gonna let it happen.
Griffin: He nods, and flies away.
Aubrey: Also, I took care of Keith, and you don’t need to worry about it— I’ll call you!
Clint: [laughs]
Griffin: He gives a thumbs up.
Indrid: [in goofy voice] Goodbye! I’m— [Justin: The Mothman got thumbs?] I’m free!
Travis: [laughs]
Griffin: As he flies away, you pull Beacon out of the roots where he’s kind of been embedded, and as you do so, you realize that where the chain sort of connected with the blade, there is a— a pretty good… there’s a pretty good like, divet in the side of the blade. It has been sort of dented inward and uh, looks kinda rough around that spot.
Beacon: That’s just wonderful, Duck. What a wonderful battlescar this is. And using me to my true purpose! Beacon, breaker of chains! Beacon, the emancipator, as I have always been known! [angrily] Wonderful, this is exactly how I would want to go, Duck! You know me so well!
Griffin: Uh, Ned.
Clint: Ned is gonna to do something which will seem a little weird in the context, but I just think it’s information we need. Ned’s gonna Investigate a Mystery.
Griffin: Ok.
Clint: And…
Griffin: Roll plus Sharp. [Clint rolls] That’s very bad.
Clint: [quietly] Shit.
Travis: You did a bad job, Dad.
Griffin: Ned rolled a five. There is no recovering from that. I’m going to take a hard move here, the hard move is that the goatman that is embedded in the roots of the tree— I will call him “shears goatman”— starts to move. And he sort of wrestles with these roots that are all over him, and he pulls himself out of the roots and tree. As he emerges from the tree, you realize that he has merged with this white bark. It is growing out of him, now. It is forming around his spine like a brace. You get the impression that this thing probably broke its back when Aubrey flung him against a tree and now the tree has healed him in a way by giving him this external chitin made of this white bark, but it has like corrupted him in a way, it’s sticking out in this huge gnarled lump that extends just over his head, and his eyes are clear white. And he picks up his shears, and starts walking towards you, Ned. Uhhh… Aubrey!
Travis: Well, I’m going to… So we’ve got a goatman on Duck, a goatman on Ned, the—
Griffin: You’re easy, breezy, beautiful! You’ve got nothing!
Travis: Yeah, I’m feeling great. The nailgun is—
Griffin: Jammed.
Travis: Jammed.
Griffin: Yeah, this easy fight is going extremely good, it seems like.
Travis: Yeah. Has Ned dropped the nailgun? Ned, do you still have the nailgun?
Clint: [crosstalk] I still have the nailgun.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah he still has it.
Travis: I’m going to… combat magic, blast, force… [Griffin: Okay!] the goatman approaching Ned.
Griffin: Okay. The uh, the half-wood...
Travis: Duck can take care of himself.
Griffin: Okay, cool! Yeah, Ned can-
Travis: You know what? I fucked up that goat before with this, and I’m gonna do it again!
Griffin: Alright, roll to Kick Some Ass. [Travis rolls] That is a ten. [Travis: Ten.] That is a big ten. On a ten plus, you get to choose an extra effect, you both deal damage to each other but you can also: gain the advantage, take plus one forward or give plus one forward to another hunter, inflict terrible harm, plus one harm, you suffer less harm, minus one harm, or you force them where you want them.
Travis: I’m going to force them where I want ‘em.
Griffin: ‘Kay.
Travis: Knock ‘em backwards. [Griffin: Okay.] And that is three harm total.
Griffin: Okay! You knock them backwards and this hard shell around its back sort of collides with the tree again, only this time he does not, you know, crumple instantly. He is definitely damaged, and you actually see just a split in his skin and this white sap just starts pouring out of him? And actually, as he hits the tree, you see more bark, and not just bark, but actual chunks of wood from the trunk start falling off around where the nail hit the tree. And as it does so, I think it loses a lot of branches. A lot of the branches where this nail went in just sort of fall to the ground harmlessly. And then he stands up, and he takes the shears and he snaps them in half. And now just has sort of two blades, and he flings one at you, Aubrey. [Travis: Okay] And you take… you take two harm as this thing cuts into you.
Travis: Well I ignore one, thanks to my cool vest.
Griffin: Yeah, it does not cut into you, the vest definitely protects you a bit, as it makes its way harmlessly over your shoulder, it sort of cuts across your neck a little bit, and you get a superficial one harm. Mark that.
Travis: And once he’s knocked out of the way, Aubrey says to Ned,
Aubrey: Get the nailgun working!
Griffin: Uhhh, Duck!
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: What do ya do?
Justin: Uh…
Griffin: You are definitely still engaged with shovel goatman, he, seeing that the mothman flew off, has picked up his shovel and is a… he is a threat. There is still the half-wood goatman, who definitely looks like, bigger and nastier than shovel goatman does, he has just been knocked into the tree. Then you have the tree itself, which has continued to rot around where this nail has stabbed into it. And then you have this like flurry of like… spores, that are sort of swirling around the tree that Aubrey made.
Duck: Hey listen partner. I have this sword, his name is Beacon, and I could use him to chop your head off, but I would really rather not do that, cause one of y’all is a pal of mine, and I’m having a hard time just sort of like… ending you? So it’d be great if you would just put down your shovel and go live a new life somewhere and get a job— as I’m saying it I know it sounds ridiculous, I’m probably going to need to punch you in the face. Okay. You know what? It…uh… yeah, let me just punch you in the face.
Griffin: [laughs] Okay! Go ahead to roll and kick some ass.
Justin: Am I acting… on my Read a Bad Situation?
Griffin: I don’t think so. Not for this action, right?
Justin: Doesn’t seem like it.
Griffin: That is a fucking eleven. And you were just punching him with your fist?
Justin: Um, yeah, I really… oh man! I’d love to just use Beacon on these guys, I’m having a really hard time of it! I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem right to me that one of them would be chill… [Griffin: Sure.] and I’d be friends with, and the other one I’d bisect, like, it just feels weird.
Travis: I saw someone point out on Twitter, and like I love this, that basically the difference between the Pine Guard and the Bureau of Balance, is that when we were the Bureau of Balance it’s like, “We’ll murder everyone!” And this time it’s like, “Well this person is actively attacking us, but I don’t know…”
Griffin: I think it’s just one harm that you do, but you get to choose an extra effect, which is gain—
Clint: Doesn’t Beacon have a flat? Isn’t there a flat to the blade?
Griffin: I mean, there is now that he fucked it up on the chains. You get to gain the advantage, plus one forward, give one to another hunter, terrible harm, less harm, or force them where you want them.
Justin: Uh, I’m gonna force them where I want them. I would like to use that advantage to, and tell me if this jives with your sort of… to disarm him.
Griffin: Um, I don’t think so, man. I feel like you are sort of… it feels like a lot to accomplish just with one thing, right, to just completely neutralize him just by punching him. Like you can—
Justin: I’ll just like knock him to the ground, and hopefully I can like knock him out on a tree stump or something.
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t know that that happens. What happens first is, because he sort of has range on you, if you are coming in with a fist and he’s got a shovel, um, this thing is done fucking around.
Justin: I’ve brought a fist to a shovel fight.
Griffin: You’ve brought a fist to a shovel fight.
Clint: [laughs]
Griffin: This thing is done messing around. It is, you know, big and very strong. It rears this shovel up and brings it right down on your skull, and you take three harm as this thing tries to just bash your fucking head in. And you sort of—
Travis: You ignore two.
Griffin: You— yes you do ignore two—
Justin: Still, it’s not none. [laughs]
Griffin: You sort of shake it off though, and punch him, and as you punch him, he does fall backwards and lands on the roots at the base of the tree. Uh, Ned!
Clint: Ned is going to Act Under Pressure to unjam the nail gun.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: With his nail gun repairing experience.
Griffin: Yeah, I mean it is pressure… there is pressure here. You’ve got a big tree, you got two nasty goatmen, and you’re trying to do this in kind of a fake snow storm. Go ahead and roll plus Cool. [Clint rolls] Oh my god. That is— that’s a five.
Travis: Have you leveled up recently, Dad? Cause you just rolled a five.
Griffin: Yeah, mark experience for all of your failed rolls here.
Clint: I just— I just— wait a minute. I have something I wanna try.
Griffin and Justin: Okay.
Justin: Rerolling. Editing.
Travis: Is it going back in time?
[laughter]
Clint: No, Ned has a thing called “artifact”, where he quote unquote found a magical artifact, [Griffin: Oh, yeah.] and it’s a lucky charm for him… I want to use Luck.
Griffin: [surprised] Oh! Okay!
Justin: Fair.
Griffin: Okay, I know what happens here. This is great. You are picking nervously at the nailgun, just tinkering with it, your hands are shaking, they are cold, you are trying to make out the mechanisms of this nail gun in the middle of this maelstrom of the spores coming out of the tree. And through those spores, you look up as you hear the crunching of snow moving closer and closer to you. And you see a figure charging at you through the storm. And you look back down at the nail gun trying to fidget with it and then back up to the figure as it gets closer and closer...
Ned, you flash back to a pretty innocuous day several years ago, we haven’t really established what the timeline is, but it is after the day of the crash and sort of your escape, your whistle stop tour of east coast destinations moving southbound until you arrived in Kepler and met Victoria, the proprietor of the Cryptonomica, who basically gave you a job and gave you room and board. And you’ve been there for several months, and we haven’t really explored too much this time of your life, but how has life living in Cryptonomica and getting your feet below you in Kepler— what has that looked like? How have you been helping Victoria out around the museum?
Clint: Well, for Ned it’s been kind of… boring? Um… he’s kind of had this sedentary life, you know, doing little things around— as little as possible, to be honest with you. Dusting, you know, and he’s not really into this shit, it’s just not that interesting to him. [Griffin: Yeah.] He’s just kind of hiding out and he misses the thrills— not really realizing that by, you know, adapting to this life is what’s gonna keep him from ever getting back to that life, um…
Griffin: Can we explore— you mentioned that it is kind of boring here, and you have been living out of the Cryptonomica and working there. And it’s got to be different from the Cryptonomica as it is under the Ned Chicane brand, right? [Clint: Oh yeah!] It is definitely more sensational now than it was back then. Back then it was a fairly, you know, ‘authentic’ monster museum.
Clint: Well, and not even— so much of a monster museum as it was really— it was almost like a… very scientific approach, you know? It didn’t really claim that things were real, you know what I mean? It just was like more of an investigative— it was much more… believable. I mean, it was much more realistic, and it was “Here are the stories from this area.” Almost like a story telling— it wasn’t really so much of a sensational—
Griffin: But it was also, like, dead. Like, I think back then, because it was very straightforward, like, nobody was coming to it. And so what I really like is like, the nature of your relationship with Victoria— who just likes your company, she was super lonely, and she’s kind of outcast in this town so she just likes having a friend, likes having someone be around. I think there’s like this push and pull with you during the months that you lived there where you, maybe because of your, you know, inherent showmanship, tried to add a little bit—
Clint: Oh, comes up with ideas—
Griffin: Add some spice to it.
Ned: You oughta really— yeah, how about— you need displays! How about...things that look like a sasquatch or, you know, models! All you’ve got are printouts of stories, and yeah, the Bigfoot picture’s good, but how cool would it be if you got an artist to draw, like, a fully blown, fine portrait of Bigfoot. And just things like that, take some of this junk and jazz it up, make it look like it’s real stuff. Like maybe that really is a scale from the loch ness monster, and it could be just a big salmon scale or something, but that’s what you need. You gotta get traffic, you gotta get people in the door!
Griffin: That is what the scene is then, for sure. You and Victoria are in the Cryptonomica. You have hired somebody to paint this big portrait of Bigfoot. And he comes in the door, you hear the bell above the door ring, and it’s a kid named Kirby who comes in and sets his paints down in front of this big canvas that you have set up for him and walks over to the RC Cola vending machine, gets one out, cracks it open, starts drinking and starts painting as you and Victoria kind of just clean up around the store. I may have called her Mama earlier, which may have been a slip of the tongue, but— you all are just kind of cleaning up the store and watching Kirby do his work as she looks over sort of your projects and looks at the store and kind of takes stock of how much it’s changed, and she says,
Victoria: Uh, hey there Ned, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Ned: Uh, certainly, Victoria! Certainly, certainly. Carry on, young man, with your artistic endeavors.
Kirby: Well thanks, sir, I’ll try not to let you down.
Griffin: And he keeps at his work, and you all—
Ned: And how ‘bout a coaster, under that RC?
Griffin: And he says,
Kirby: Oh my God, I’m so sorry.
Griffin: And he reaches into his bag and pulls out a CD jewel case and sets his drink down on top of it. Uh, you go outside with Victoria. It’s like a nice fall day. The leaves have just started to change and are falling in droves which makes you realize you’re gonna have to rake very soon, but you try to put that unpleasant thought out of your mind as you and Victoria talk, and she says,
Victoria: Ned, I gotta say I know I was hesitant at first about some of the changes you suggested, but… I think you’ve brought life into this store in a way I was never able to. I just— I just wanted to say thank you.
Ned: Oh, no! Vicky, I owe you this! You took me in, you gave me a place to live, and you gave me your friendship, and— no, I— the ledger is very much still in your favor. I owe you. And, I mean, yeah, it’s been...boring as shit, but, you know, I’ve, you know, I have appreciated your kindness. It came at a time when I really needed a friend, and I’m glad it was you.
Griffin: She says,
Victoria: Yeah, I know life in Kepler ain’t the most glamorous lifestyle to live. It’s probably certainly not as exciting as some of your earlier days, uh—
Ned: It makes Hooterville look like Paris, to be honest with you.
Victoria: Yeah.
Griffin: She laughs, and she says,
Victoria: But I gotta say, like, you know, I enjoy your company, as insincere as your company seems sometimes, but—
Ned: Thank you.
Victoria: Listen, what I wanted to talk to you about, what we haven’t really talked about much, is— you know, what the Cryptonomica is all about. I’m just, I’m curious and I want the truth for once from you, Ned. Are you— are you a believer?
Ned: Uh… no. No, not really, Victoria. I— I think it’s interesting and everything, but I— I am not a man of faith. I don’t really believe in too much, except for myself. I— you know, I find it interesting, I think it’s fun to contemplate, it’s fun to think about, but… I’m not convinced.
Victoria: Well, you put on a good act.
Griffin: And you can tell she looks kind of disappointed. She says,
Victoria: I don’t— I don’t blame you though, you know, most—
Ned: Well don’t—don’t get me wrong. I believe in the Cryptonomica. I believe that it serves a purpose. I think it’s fun, I think it’s expansive to make people think outside, you know, the world that they know. I believe in the Cryptonomica. I just don’t believe in all the crap we’ve got in it.
Griffin: She says,
Victoria: I guess that’s something. It does serve a purpose, Ned, I’m glad you get that. It’s a serious world we live in, Ned, full of serious problems— real problems, and, you know, folks are just engineered to fight for solutions to those problems. And it’s a fight worth fighting, I don’t mean to minimize that, but, it’s just— this world is so much bigger and so much more mystifying than most folks are willing to give it credit for.
And that’s why we have trouble growing our business here, Ned, that’s why folks in Kepler don’t really… like the Cryptonomica. It’s why city hall would be happy to shut us down, you know, we’re a thorn in their philosophical side. This place voices the inconvenient position that there’s more to this life than the troubles we conjure up for each other and… that’s why this place is important. That’s why I think it’s important, and I’m glad it sounds like we’re on the same page about that.
Ned: Well, don’t take my demeaning manner as any implication that I don’t believe it’s important. I do believe it’s important, and I think it’s a wonderful place, and I think it does something good. But, Victoria, you don’t really believe in eight-foot hairy bigfeet and men looking like moths and— you really, I mean, you don’t really [laughing] believe in that stuff, do you?
Griffin: She leans against the railing of the porch out in front of the Cryptonomica and just sort of looks out at the leaves as they’re changing and dancing around in the wind, and she says—
Victoria: I believe in strange things, Ned. [Coughs]
Griffin: And she starts coughing…really hard. And you’ve seen these fits a lot in the months that you’ve been living with Victoria and they are getting worse very quickly. This one’s a particularly difficult one and she kind of like, stumbles backwards and sits in a rocking chair out in front of the porch and tries to collect herself.
Ned: Did you ever go see Doctor Ninny about that cough?
Griffin: She smiles and she says,
Victoria: Ned, I’ve been seeing doctors about this cough for longer than I’ve… let on.
Griffin: She says,
Victoria: A wanted criminal breaks into a dying woman’s home. And she gives him room and board, and hopes against hope that he’ll turn out better than he was when he slipped in through the window. And she’s the only one in town who’d give him that chance. And it just so happened that hers was the place that he burgled. I don’t know how you don’t believe in the strangeness of things knowing that.
Ned: Victoria… I believe that there’s things that happen in the world. I don’t— I don’t know if it’s luck or fortune or whatever. But I do believe that there was something involved in bringing me to you! And bringing me to this place. I have no idea what that force is, or why that happened, but… I’ll give you that much. I believe that there is such a thing as… good fortune, because I am fortunate enough to… be your friend.
Griffin: She looks up at you and smiles. And you can tell that she has tears welling in her eyes that she quickly tries to fight off. And she says,
Victoria: I think you were brought here for a reason too, Ned, and that is why I am gonna leave the Cryptonomica to you when I am gone. Um, I already made up my mind about that, nothing you can do to change it, and… I won’t be here, you can do with it what you like, but I would hope— I would ask, that you just… keep Kepler as curious as you can.
{Music 1:07:19- 1:07:25}
Griffin: And then something super lucky happens. You hear something moving around in the brush, and you hear this noise like shhh[?] and it’s getting louder and louder and right when this goatman is about to collide with you, you see… the jetpack. You see the Flymaster that has been sort of blasting around Kepler for the last two days since you lost it following your stunt. It flies into the clearing and just collides with the goat man, knocking him off of his feet and out of this path of collision towards you, and finally gives up the ghost and just kind of lands at your feet, finally dormant as you get that nail slid out of the gun and get it functioning again.
Duck: I’m proud of you, son!
Ned: [laughing] Good… [crosstalk] boy!
Duck: [crosstalk] Sorry. That’s my good son!
Clint: Ned looks over at Aubrey and tosses the gun in her direction.
Aubrey: Yes. Gun. Give.
Ned: And listen, Aubrey. Copper conducts heat!
Aubrey: I’m— no, I promised Duck, and he—
Ned: Not fire, I’m not saying fire! Heat!
Aubrey: No, he’s looking! I can’t do it now, Ned!
Duck: I’m right here guys, come on.
Griffin: Okay. Aubrey, you have the gun.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Again, there is this storm all around the tree that is whipping up a frenzy that makes it kind of hard to shoot at it at range. You can still do it, but you will be at a disadvantage.
Travis: I’m gonna get up close to it then.
Griffin: Like right up ons?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And— so you said the tree was kind of splitting, right? [crosstalk] To spray up the things?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Uh, yeah, for sure.
Travis: She’s gonna shoot a line of nails following that line all the way down to the base of the tree.
Griffin: Uh, okay, I like that. If you’re doing that and you’re trying to do this sort of precise motion in the middle of the storm, I’m not gonna make you roll to kick some ass, because the tree has no direct way of hurting you-
Justin: The tree has no ass.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Griffin: But it is— tree doesn’t have ass also, thank you, Justin, so go ahead and Act Under Pressure.
Travis: Is that Cool?
Justin: See, I’m using Duck’s experience as a forest ranger there—
Griffin: [laughing] Yeah, sure.
Justin: — to tell you trees don’t have ass.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: Fuck!
Griffin: Aubrey got a six on your roll. You could— if somebody could help you out to give you a plus one to bring you up to a mixed success, or you could drop a Luck point to pull this off for sure.
Clint: Could you not say that Ned tossing her the gun was Helping Out?
Griffin: Yeah, I think you could say that. You do still need to roll for it, right?
Justin: We apparently burned all our good rolls on like, getting Ryan Gosling movies to appear on Netflix or whatever the fuck we were doing.
[laughter]
Griffin: Uh, yeah. Ned, roll to—
Travis: So we’ll say, like, Ned tosses the thing and then turns up the pressure on the compressor, and that’s Ned—
Griffin: Well, he does need to still roll, so it’s a possibility that he didn’t turn up the pressure, he turned it way down, and the nails just fall out impotently from the end of the gun which I love that visual, it’s not really gonna move the chains though.
[Travis makes a baby noise? “Bwee, bwee, bwee, bwee”]
Griffin: Uh, okay. Ned, roll to Help Out. That is plus Cool. This may be our first Help Out roll, which is very exciting. [Clint rolls] That’s an eight!
Clint: Eight!
Griffin: On a seven to nine your help grants them plus one to their roll, but you also expose yourself to trouble or danger. Okay. So, this brings it up to a seven for you, Aubrey, which makes it a mixed success. Describe this scene of you approaching the storm and trying to just empty a clip into this tree with almost zero visibility.
Travis: So I’m gonna say she gets real close, like, right up on it, you know? And then basically draws a line straight down, like Pat! Pat! Pat! Pat! Pat!
Griffin: Okay, I like the visual of you taking a deep breath and trying to really nail this one, no— [laughter] God, we gotta stop fucking saying that. You take a deep breath and try to center yourself and gain your composure in the middle of this just, like furious storm and you raise the gun, and…
{Music 1:11:05-1:11:11}
Griffin: Aubrey, you have this moment where you remember a very powerful memory, and it was the moment that you sort of first realized that you wanted to be a magician. And we haven’t really talked about that, and I’m curious, like, what inspired that to set up whatever this scene is going to be. I don’t really know what it’s going to be. What was sort of Aubrey’s inspiration for wanting to get into magic? Was there a certain magician that she idolized? Was there a show that she saw that changed the course of her life?
Travis: So, I mean, I guess it probably would mirror my own, but we’re not really the same age, so like… Timeline wise, this wouldn’t be the same thing. But there was a magic special that I remember watching as a kid that was filmed at the Magic Castle. And it had, like, Lance Burton and a bunch of people in it. But one of the scenes, it was… and I wish I could remember the name of the performer, but she is doing this magic act where she’s like dancing with a mannequin? And she is manipulating the mannequin’s arms and stuff to do tricks. And it’s both really fun and very impressive. And I think that that kind of, like, more of like a performance art, like character building kind of thing really appealed, you know, Aubrey is a theater kid—
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: —and I think more than just the, like, sleight of hand, “Watch me do a magic trick,” more of like, “I’m gonna build the scene and make the show the show and the magic facilitates that.” Very— I’m also gonna say, because this is true of me as well— Houdini is a big inspiration for that. It’s not just the trick, the trick isn’t the thing, the thing is the show.
Griffin: Okay. Then why don’t we do this? You saw that special, it really spoke to you as like this really cool new mode of performance, and so, you know, the usual stuff maybe, you buy the books, you watch— you get the special VHS videos that teach the tips of the masters and sort of start practicing your magic. Maybe the scene is just like you performing for your parents, like doing your first private magic show to show off what you have learned from these, like, books that they have bought you and given you as gifts and stuff like that. Is that cool with you?
Travis: Definitely.
Griffin: Okay, what’s this look like? You are performing for your parents. What kind of tricks are you, uh— what kind of basic stuff were you—
Travis: I’m probably, like ten years old.
Griffin: ’Kay
Travis: You know? Like the cup and ball, maybe, like, the big finale is like a, you know, a handcuff escape? Um, probably doing, you know, the like, “Oh, roll up some newspaper and I pour the water in, ooh, where’d the water go?” That kind of thing?
Griffin: Okay, um—
Travis: Not necessarily easy stuff, but like pretty basic magic, but she’s trying to do a lot of, like, stage craft with it too, so it’s like—
Griffin: Yeah, that’s always been her jam.
Aubrey: This newspaper I’ve saved for 50 years, this was the newspaper that came out [Travis: And remember, she’s 10,] when Kennedy was shot!
[Griffin laughs]
Travis: And that wasn’t 50 years ago, you know, she just doesn’t— she doesn’t know dates.
Griffin: Okay!
Travis: And like, she’s doing a lot of that like, [Aubrey: Oh these cups were salvaged from King Tut’s tomb,] and you know, [Aubrey: This pitcher of water once belonged to Julius Caesar!], and a lot of that like—
Griffin: — ”belonged to Julia Roberts.” Why don’t you—
Aubrey: Julia Roberts! Over fifty years ago!
Griffin: Because this is not like, magic magic, why don’t you roll to Act Under Pressure as you are— that’s right, I’m going to make you— you are pressured as your parents are watching you, scoring you, judging you.
Travis: Listen, we’ve all been there, God knows.
Clint: Hey!
Travis: When dad watches me do a podcast, [Griffin: Sure.] it’s terrifying.
Travis: I got an eight.
Griffin: Alright! Mixed success. We’ll say that you are— give me one of the tricks that you are doing.
Travis: May I make a suggestion?
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: I think that Mom is impressed, and Dad is not.
Griffin: I think so too but what is— Actually no, that seems mean, I don’t wanna characterize your— the dad like that. Obviously you guys had, like, beef in that one scene you were doing but it’s still like, a loving, supporting environment.
Travis: I think the mixed success is everything goes well but I can’t get the handcuff trick to work well.
Griffin: So the handcuff trick is like the big finale, and everything else has been going fairly well and—
Travis: And I have branded it as like, “These handcuffs belonged to Houdini himself!” even though they bought it for me at the store.
Griffin: Sure, and as you do the things that you have practiced so many times, like you were very excited to finally show of your skills, you pull your wrists apart, and they are still securely fastened inside the handcuffs. And you try and try again, but you are just trapped in them in the middle of your show.
Aubrey: Ah… hold on, give me a second. Oh okay… Ah… and then do… Okay! And um, that is all— all part of the show! Oh how will I… uhm… hold— hold on. Dammit!
Aubrey’s Mom: Do you need help? And don’t cuss.
Aubrey: No, I can— I can do— I’ve done— I know what I’m doing!
Griffin: They sit there patiently but you can tell they are worried about you. And finally your dad comes over and is like,
Aubrey’s Dad: Alright, let me just see what happened here, I don’t want you to hurt yourself.
Griffin: And he starts sort of tinkering with the handcuffs and gets them off of you. And your mom can kind of tell that you are disappointed, and she says,
Aubrey’s Mom: Aubrey, the show was wonderful! You’ll get the handcuff trick down, don’t be upset.
Aubrey: [upset] …It— It didn’t work.
Aubrey’s Mom: I know, but you haven’t been doing this for very long, baby. It’s— listen, you don’t need to be perfect at this— people are going to love you!
Aubrey: Yeah, but Houdini was performing when he was like, a little kid! And he was—
Aubrey’s Mom: People still had to practice, Houdini still had to practice, Aubrey. Listen, people are going to love you when you are doing these shows no matter what you are going to do! Magicians are responsible for delighting and surprising people and you delight and surprise us every day. Nobody expects you to be perfect at this, right from the start! You have time to learn!
Griffin: And then suddenly, like, the memory… shifts. And it’s not your mom in front of you anymore telling you these things— it’s Janelle. And you are in sort of Janelle’s office in Sylvain and she’s poured you and herself a cup of strong, hot tea. And she’s seated at a table with you, sipping a tea with you. And she’s more formally dressed than you’ve ever seen her, and she’s dressed in this black, nice ensemble, and she’s not wearing her usual colorful scarves. In fact she has one draped around your shoulders, something she put there to sort of warm you up and bring you comfort. And she says,
Janelle: You have time to learn. I know this is difficult to believe, but you do! The surviving remnants of this world have unreasonable expectations for you, true. Sylvain will express her needs when she is ready and I trust you to listen intently for her. You have time to learn to listen, but you do not need to bear that weight today.
Aubrey: But you don’t know that, you don’t know how much time I have. No one does. I have to go out there and fight monsters, and scary things! And not just that, there’s real danger in the world, There’s accidents, and plane crashes, and house fires!
Griffin: She talks like right over you, like she can’t hear the words you’re saying. And she places a hand on your cheek, and you realize that you’ve been sobbing as she’s been talking to you, and she says,
Janelle: Today, it is okay to take care of yourself and to allow others to take care of you and to mourn.
Griffin: And that’s when you realize she is dressed the way that she is dressed because you just came from your father’s funeral, and then you realize, this is not your memory at all. This is the memory of Alexandra, the newly christened audience to divinity and interpreter of Sylvain.
Travis: Oh shit.
[Music plays]
Griffin: And sure enough, you launch a line of nails following sort of the path of the main split in the center of the tree. And, as you do so, sure enough, the bark and wood all around all around this line, it just sort of, it doesn’t fall off like it did for Ned’s one nail, it just sort of explodes. And as it does so, the tree just completely splits in half. The two halfs just bend away from each other. As they do so, the force of this explosion and the chunks of wood coming off the tree, they launch into you, Aubrey, for two harm. Ned, one of the bows of the tree just falls and conks you on the head for two harm.
[Clint whistles like birds.]
Griffin: Oh one of the halves of the tree, as it falls, falls right on top of the goatman that Duck knocked to the roots, and just crushes it into the roots. And he lets out one last loud bleat, and gives up the ghost.
As the dust settles from this big explosion that happens, you all see something in the center of these two halves. Just still sticking out of the trunk, and it is tethered to the two halves of the tree that have been split apart. It is connected to it by these long strands of white sap. You see this humanoid form that appears to just be made out of this white sap. It is reaching upward, and it is holding on to these long strands and is trying to pull the tree back together, and doesn’t seem to be paying much mind to you all, it is just trying to sort of put together what you all have destroyed. Duck, you are up.
Duck: Yeah. Hey, I— y’all, I know it ain’t copper but I’m gonna give it a shot.
Justin: —and I’m gonna Kick Some Ass. Just, Kick— I— Now can I kick ass?
Griffin: [laughing] Yeah.
Travis: Now does this thing have an ass?
Griffin: Yeah. This thing for sure has an ass.
Justin: It has manifested an ass. I’m gonna kick that ass with Beacon.
Griffin: Alright.
Clint: Kick that sap ass!
Beacon: Yes, this is more like it. Excellent. Let’s go!
Justin: Nine.
Clint: Aaand we’re back!
Griffin: That is a nine. Okay, you and the tree are going to deal harm to each other. Um, what that means for the tree, I’m going to leave a little bit abstract. What do you do to the tree with Beacon? How are you sort of dispatching it?
Justin: I— How big of a trunk are we talking?
Griffin: I mean the trunk has been split down to the ground. The humanoid creatures sticking out of it are about your size.
Justin: Okay so here’s what I do. So I’m worried about the edge of Beacon, being damaged, so I uncoil Beacon and I—
[music begins to play]
[metallic clang]
Justin: Oh— it just hit my mic— my mic stand.
Travis: Oh, I thought that was foley!
Clint: So cool!
Griffin: That was fucking awesome, dude!
Clint: Wow!
Justin: Alright, leave that in and pretend I did it on purpose. So I uncoil Beacon, and I whip it around the thing, and yank as hard as I can. Just trying to saw it— saw it in half.
Clint: [laughing] Oh god!
Griffin: It grabs onto your wrist as you wrap Beacon around it, and like, leans in close to you like, bringing its face right to yours. As you rip Beacon outwards and cut this thing in half at the torso, and its upper half just goes flying through the air and lands on the ground and disintegrates. And behind the form that you just cut in half, you see that half-wood goat charging at you, and right as you dispatch the sap being at the center of this tree, the whites of its eyes just go dark, and the sap that was pouring out of it just instantly comes to a stop and the goat just dies while running— it dies on its feet— and it falls over.
With that, there is just one sort of exhalation of spores, and they all fall down right on top of all of you as Aubrey’s whirlwind finally dies down. And the stump at your feet starts to rot in fast motion, leaking out sap that’s just evaporating right before your eyes. And as the stump disappears, there’s an object left sitting on the ground. It’s a seed, a large, opalescent pod with tufts of soft fibers reaching upward from its crown. And there’s a quiet for a moment as the wind dies down and the spores stop shooting out of this tree, and in that moment— this time you all see it, you all see these humanoid figures of white light, these four-armed beings that are just about your size.
One of them climbs out of the trunk of the tree as if he was just hiding in there the whole time, and another one climbs out of the half-wood goat’s corpse, and the other one sort of pries itself out from under the fallen tree from the corpse of the goat that has been crushed there. And as they all sort of stand up and look at each other, all three of those things, the trunk and the two goat men just start disintegrating into these black flakes that float up and into the air like embers from a campfire. And one by one these three humanoid beings made out of this light just look at all of you and just solemnly bow and very quickly after that they all disintegrate into just these little beads of white light that float up and off into the distance.
[Music 1:25:26]
{Ad break 1:25:42-1:31:52}
Griffin: Aubrey, you all have made your way out of the woods and you are looking over the cliffside outside of Amnesty Lodge with sort of the assembled Lodge crew. And from your position, you can see something strange. It’s what you all are kind of gawking at. Just below you— you have a great vantage point on it, looking down on Riverside from atop the cliff— there is a massive sinkhole just off Main Street. You can see it so well, it has consumed what looks like a parking garage, one that was— it appears empty, you don’t see any cars in it, it was, you know late when this happened. Just at a cursory glance it doesn’t seem like anything too horrible happened.
But, this sinkhole, it seemed like it was expanding and just kind of stopped a dozen or so feet away from St. Francis Medical Center. If it had continued to grow it would have been, you know, disastrous for the dozens of people inside that building at the time. And there are, you know, emergency response vehicles, you see, you know, flashing lights all around the sink hole as they— as rescue teams go through and just make sure everything is okay, but the scene seems pretty calm, so you assume things are okay. But, you see Agent Stern come running down the path from Amnesty Lodge. He has changed out of his pajamas and back into his suit and long peacoat and he’s still fastening his watch around his wrist as he approaches and he clears his throat and says,
Agent Stern: I’m going to head down and see if there’s anything that I can do to help. I’ll be back late if you wouldn’t mind leaving the lobby unlocked for me.
Griffin: Uh, and he—
Aubrey: We’ll leave a light on for you.
Griffin: He nods and bolts down the access road towards town. Um, and you all are just sort of standing there looking at this sinkhole out of town. I imagine you’ve already sort of debriefed with Mama and given her the good news. But everybody’s here, everybody’s looking down on this thing that has happened, and Dani, standing right next to you— she’s got Doctor Harris Bonkers sort of positioned on her shoulder parrot style— she looks at you and she says,
Dani: The, um… The abominations, they’re… they’re getting stronger, aren’t they?
Aubrey: Yeah, this one was— this one was different.
Griffin: She looks— I mean, she looks scared, and she—
Aubrey: Hey, but— but I mean, look at it this way. We’re getting stronger too. I mean, like, I’m getting better at magic, and like, Duck actually chose to kill something, um… And like, Ned is at least 5% less of a coward, so like… eh?
Griffin: She gives like a faint smile but you can tell she— she’s— it did not bring her much relief, and she reaches over as you two are looking down over the devastation below and takes hold of you hand. And as she does so, Doctor Harris Bonkers kind of rouses and clambors over to your shoulder, kind of, you know, clumsily, and nuzzles into your hair, um—
Aubrey: Hey, buddy.
Griffin: And just then, flakes start falling from the sky. And I think you have, like a moment— I think everybody has a moment of panic, but then as one lands on your nose you realize with relief it’s real snow. This gentle, quiet, windless snow has begun to fall in Kepler. This nice peaceful moment is interrupted as Mama joins the party overlooking the chaos below and she puts a hand on your not-rabbit occupied shoulder and she says,
Mama: Can I, uh… Can I have a word with you?
Aubrey: Yeah— yeah.
Griffin: And you walk with her back towards Amnesty Lodge and towards the cellar door. She says,
Mama: We still need to have a talk about the abomination that you all have adopted and its whereabouts, but before all that, you wanna tell me what Thacker’s doing locked in the panic room?
Aubrey: Oh God, it’s a whole thing, Mama. Like, you know the tree makes bad things happen, released, made a pin drop, the net dropped or whatever, he got out and we tricked him into the panic room. We have a lot to talk about.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: Yeah, I was— I admit I was not the most plugged in this hunt, but listen. Tomorrow, you and the gang are gonna need to try and get him sealed up in the kitchen again. He needs— He needs to eat, Aubrey. He’s still a person under all that stuff.
Aubrey: Well, speaking of, I’ve been doing a lot of research, studying and doing the books and everything and talking with Janelle, and… I’d like to try to help him.
Mama: How do you mean?
Aubrey: Well, I’ve— I wouldn’t say I’m mastering it, but I’m getting a better grip on magic, and I think if we can figure out, like, the right way to ask and like, I don’t know, this might be bigger than the kind of thing I’ve done before, but… I was able to, like, heal Keith. That’s a whole thing I’ll tell you about too. If we can do some kind of, like, big psychological healing, maybe? Maybe we can bring him back.
Griffin: She smiles, like the thought of her friend being, you know, exorcised in this way has never really crossed her mind as a possibility, and she smiles, and— it’s the first time you’ve seen her smile since you told her that you all brought an abomination into her home, and she says,
Mama: I— I would be thrilled to help you out with that in any way I can. For right now, though,
Griffin: And she reaches up to the railing of the porch and pulls down a plate that she had set up there with some food, and she says,
Mama: If you could get this to him somehow, maybe just open up the door, slide it in there real quick and get out— if he sees me, he’s gonna freak out, and I just wanna make sure he doesn’t, you know, starve to death before we can, apparently, rescue him.
Aubrey: Yeah, you— sure, why not. And Mama, when that’s done,
Travis: And Aubrey kind of touches her sunglasses,
Aubrey: There’s something else I need to talk to you about, okay?
Griffin: She nods, and opens up the cellar door for you. And you approach the panic room. I think, as we set up before, there’s not like a window inside, there’s just like a monitor? And as you step into the room, Thacker is not, like, in the position that you’ve kind of seen him, this kind of meditative, sitting on the floor, just kind of like staring intently down at the ground. He is standing up, and he is looking directly up and into the camera, and you see him on the monitor just like staring, just like he’s looking right at you from behind the door. What do you do?
Travis: Is there any way to talk, like, into the room? Is there like a coms system?
Griffin: Yeah I think so. There’s a— we’ll say there’s like a speaker on the door, like a two way speaker.
Travis: So—
Clint: There is.
Travis: She pushes the button and she’s like,
Aubrey: Heeey. I’ve got some food here, but you need to be chill. Like, a nine. On a scale of one to ten of chill. And then you can have some food, and then I’m gonna close the door back, and it would be super cool if you didn’t, like, jump at me, or anything like that.
Griffin: You release the button after saying this and he doesn’t move. You see him still standing staring into the camera. And then you hear a voice. And it doesn’t seem like it’s coming from the speaker. You just hear it. And this voice says,
Thacker[?]: [several voices talking at once] Why am I kept here?
Aubrey: UHm!??
Thacker[?]: Why am I being kept here?
Aubrey: Thacker??
Thacker[?]: Thacker… is...the name of this one? He is an unintentional [glitching] host.
Aubrey: Who— who are you, then?
Thacker[?]: [glitching throughout] At this moment, we seem to be… Thacker. But that is not who we are supposed to be. What have we done wrong?
Aubrey: Oh man, where to start. Um… Are you from Sylvain?
Thacker[?]: [glitching continues] Sylvain can no longer… sustain the life that [unintelligible glitching; possibly 'treads'] her surface. We are the counter weight that aims to bring the planet back into balance. Will you release us?
Aubrey: Hoo boy. You know, I think that that— I don’t have clearance to make that decision, you know?
[Clint laughs]
Aubrey: I’m just gonna put this sandwich in there real quick, and then I’m gonna get to work on your request. Um, you help me help you, and please don’t attack me when I open this door?
Griffin: Are you opening the door?
Travis: You know what, no. I’m not.
Griffin: [laughing] Okay. Alright.
Travis: I’m gonna go fucking get Mama.
Griffin: Okay. You turn to walk away and you hear this voice say,
Thacker[?]: Please release us. Sylvain has become hollow. Those living on her surface would seek to shatter her body entirely in pursuit of their own survival. Please release us, by impeding us you hasten the arrival of Sylvain’s end.
Aubrey: Wait… Sylvain’s end? Does this have to do with the crystal and the magic and stuff?
Griffin: With that, I think realizing that you’re just not gonna release it, you see Thacker on the camera take a big step backwards and sit down on the ground and slowly angle his head back downwards to stare at the floor.
Ned, you have had an eventful few days, I think. I think the hunt has been particularly taxing for you, yes?
Clint: Three harm…
Griffin: Yeah, you lost your car, you ended up in the hospital at one point, you unintentionally antagonized the sheriff, things were challenging, your adrenaline was going, but now things have like, slowed down. I have one question: How does Ned feel about what he realized about what he realized about Aubrey? That is was her home that he robbed that night— the night of the crash.
Clint: I think from the moment that he was in the unconscious state and heard what Aubrey had to say, and kind of figure out what was going on, I think he has felt very uncomfortable around Aubrey. [Griffin: Okay.] I think he has- there was a lot of guilt involved with that night anyway, [Griffin: Sure.] but Ned, whether he’s fooling himself or not, puts a lot of the blame on Boyd Mosch— his partner— that night. [Griffin: Sure.] In his long career, Ned never hurt anybody in the jobs he’d pulled— not physically harmed anybody—
Griffin: Yeah, I’ll buy that.
Clint: He took a lot of pride in that. And I think he fancied himself as a… almost like a Robin Hood— that’s how he saw himself. And I think the violence that came about that night, and the unfortunate things- the death, and the fire, and everything else— I think he really lays at Boyd’s feet. But the guilt has really come crashing back at him quite a bit.
Griffin: I’m just curious about how you feel about doing anything about this guilt or sort of you know, and maybe this is appropriate for your character— this is not a slam— but this is how he’s been developed, like, is Ned just not going to confront it?
Clint: No, I think he— I think he has to. I think if everytime he and Duck and Aubrey go out, I think they have become closer, I think they have become closer, they have become more of a unit. I think he realizes that in order for that to continue, he’s gotta open up, he’s gotta tell her about it. [Griffin: Okay.] And I think he decided that his life is better cooperating with and working with Aubrey— and Duck— [Griffin: Sure.] than a life on his own. And I think that was one of the things that Victoria brought to him too, not just the Cryptonomica, but to show that he could have people in his life that he could count on.
Griffin: Then… here’s the scene. You are returning to the Cryptonomica, you are in the Sno-Cat. You pull it into the fairly small, humble parking lot of the Cryptonomica, and as you do so, you actually see that the wreckage of your Lincoln Continental has finally been separated from the funicular and towed back in front of your place of business. You see it illuminated by the headlights of your Sno-Cat. The store is, you know, dark, it has closed up shop hours ago. And you get out, and approach the museum, and go to open the door. And as you place your hand on the handle and start to put the keys inside, I think you, because of who you are and the past that you have, you notice something off. The doorframe around the deadbolt is cracked and splintered. And through the gap that has been made there, you can see that the deadbolt is already unlocked. What do you do?
Clint: Very cautiously, I think he calls upon his burglar instincts, his sneaky instincts, and opens the door just wide enough to slip through.
Griffin: Okay!
Clint: Because there are no lights outside, ‘cause he turned the headlights off, so it’s not like he would be illuminated in the door, and he steps into the Cryptonomica, very surreptitiously, and really strains his ears to try to hear and try to look. There’s a small— a little bit of light from some of the, you know, displays and stuff but not very much.
Griffin: Okay, you slip into the main room of the Cryptonomica, and you find… that it looks fine! It looks, you know, exactly how Kirby usually leaves it when he wraps up one of his night shifts. It looks nice and dusted and mopped and cleaned. You actually see behind the front counter of the museum, you see Billy back there, and he is sleeping in a cot, almost like Kirby tucked him in back there, [Clint: Aww.] and he is fast asleep and just ripping the gnarliest snores you’ve ever heard, because he is still a goat. And, yeah, everything looks fine, except on the counter, towards the back of the room, where there are sort of displays full of pamphlets. Sitting on that counter are three padlocks that are all popped open. And as you get closer to them and carefully creep over and look at them, you can tell that they are the locks that were threaded through the latches onto the door of the inner sanctum.
Clint: He goes sprinting back to the inner sanctum.
Griffin: You open up the door, and, it… was a clean job, Ned. By which I mean like, the room itself, is clean. It looks like it did probably the day it was built. There are no signs of intrusion, no debris scattered all across the ground. The room has just simply been emptied. Everything in here, your trophies of your burglaries, your passports and documents, the small safe containing Aubrey's necklace, among other things, it is all just gone.
Clint: Clooney’s Oscar?
Griffin: All gone.
Clint: Ahh! Fuck me runnin’.
Griffin: And there is a light bulb hanging overhead that is illuminating this room and it is shining down on the only item still remaining in this room. It is a note, written on the back of a Cryptonomica postcard, that is sort of folded up and laying on the floor. And as this light is swinging over it, you see that it reads:
“For my cut, plus interest, not quite even yet. I’ll be in touch. B.”
[Music 1:47:40- 1:48:33]
Griffin: Duck, you’re back in your apartment, and you had just sort of started to peel off your thick layers of winter wear, and sheathe Beacon wherever you keep him, sort of now having time to survey the damage done to him, and you’re sort of decompressing like that when Minerva appears in front of you. And she says,
Minerva: Another successful hunt, I take it? Congratulations!
Duck: Ah, thanks, Minnie, I appreciate it.
Minerva: I don’t love that name, but you have…you have exceeded my lofty expectations for you.
Duck: Yeah, I did— [sighs] I fucked up, kinda, I fucked up Beacon a lil’ bit. I feel kinda lousy about it.
Minerva: May I see?
Duck: Ah, yeah, sure.
Justin: I go to the underwear drawer and get Beacon out.
Griffin: Uh, she surveys the damage to the blade and she sighs and says,
Minerva: Well, I— I suppose it can’t be helped. I’m sure he will still serve you well, it seems like he still has uh… some lethal capabilities. Um, Duck Newton, I know you are tired, but I have something I— need to say to you, and it cannot wait a moment longer.
Duck: Alright.
Griffin: She gestures towards like one of the chairs in your living room.
Justin: I take a seat.
Griffin: She says,
Minerva: Duck Newton… I am a m-murderer.
Griffin: And as she says that you see her silhouette kind of like deflate a bit, almost as if she’s like… relieved? From finally saying what she said. And she says,
Minerva: I told you earlier that my world, like yours, was tethered to an alien planet besieged by abominations from the other side.
Duck: Mhm?
Minerva: This was only… part of the truth. I was the war councilor for my people. I-I pushed us into a conflict with that alien world. Our steel and fighting prowess crashed against their insectoid chitin and hivemind coordination, and there were losses, incalculable losses, on both sides, but ultimately our world lost the war. They left us with just a handful of survivors. And so I forced the last great minds of our civilization to create a weapon that could defeat our foe for good, a disease. Lethal to our enemy, innocuous to ourselves— I delivered the payload myself, Duck Newton, I watched as— every living being on that planet— [pause] I am the only survivor of both worlds now, and so I sought out the reason for our shared fate, and in doing so found Earth and Sylvain, and you, like other Chosen before you were selected to keep your people safe. That is just part of your destiny, Duck. Your true destiny is to not follow in my footsteps.
[a pause]
Duck: Damn, Minerva, that’s a lot to… dump on a guy, I’ve had kinda a full day already, without… startin’ to process your… genocide. Um…
Minerva: There’s… more I have to tell you, unfortunately—
Duck: Damn, more than genocide, Minerva!? Shit!
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: She says,
Minerva: I told you this now because my concerns about losing your trust, of damaging our… relationship— in a few moments, it’s not going to matter anymore. Your power, Duck Newton, it stems from your connection with me and my world, that includes… your power of foresight. Surely you saw it, Duck, you saw in your vision, the meteor.
Duck: Yeah, yeah.
Minerva: …It was never coming to Earth. It was coming for me. [a pause, Minerva’s music begins to play] My world was prepared once for this contingency, I will go to ground and try as I always have to survive, but the mechanism through which I am able to speak with you, it will be annihilated.
Duck: [softly] What?
Minerva: This will be our last conversation, Duck Newton, I-I beg of you, remember my world—
Duck: Nah, nah, hold on, there’s gotta be somethin’, uh…
Minerva: Keep your world safe, keep Sylvain safe, continue your training. It will be… harder after our link is severed, but you mustn’t lose faith.
Duck: Minerva, why now? Like, wh-why would I finally decide to do something about this destiny and powers and all this garbage— Now? Now I’m gonna lose it all? Now I’m just gonna be some dipshit? With a sword? A br— a fucked-up sword?
Griffin: She looks to the side and like cranes her neck upward like she’s looking out a window, and she says,
Minerva: I’m sorry, Duck Newton, I kn—
Duck: God, n— you know, fuck me. I’m sorry, I’m bein’ really self-interested right now, you got a meteor headed towards your house, let’s just get safe and take care of yourself and— and try to be okay, alright, I’ll be fine here, I’ll buy a gun or somethin’, Jesus.
Griffin: She crosses one of her arms across her chest and gives you a bow, a deep bow, and then she stands up and takes one last look at you and pivots to the side one more time and says,
Minerva: It’s time to stop hiding. You need to finish what I started. Go to him.
Duck: …Go to who?
Griffin: And she turns back to you and she says,
Minerva: Duck Newton. My pupil, my friend. I was not talking to you.
Griffin: And she disappears. [a pause as Minerva’s music fades out] And then there’s a knock at the door to your apartment.
Justin: I… go to the door and open it.
Griffin: You see framed in the snow that is blanketing Kepler as twilight approaches, a figure standing at your doorstep. You see that he’s wearing a peacoat and some beat up, fingerless, wool gloves, one of which is wrapped around the hilt of a long broadsword that he’s leaning against as you open up the door. And your eyes adjust to the light more, and you see the face of the person holding this blade: Leo Tarkesian, your neighbor and friendly local grocer clears his throat and says,
[a beat]
Leo: So, uh… we should probably talk.

Griffin: Previously, on The Adventure Zone…
Griffin: Duck you see, a vision. You see a stone archway.
Pidgeon: I ran into somethin’, out in the woods. My buddy Pete, we ran out into somethin’ out in the woods and he’s still out there.
Duck: ‘Bout the biggest animal we get in these parts is the good ol’, Black Bear.
Pidgeon: You got somethin’ waaay bigger in these woods.
Griffin: You touch your finger to the back of the card, it actually kind of, explodes.
Mama: C’mon now, I know real magic when I see it, fess up! You thought you’d just go blowin’ up ski lodges all willy-nilly like that?
Aubrey: I’d be happy to talk to you more, in the truck, away from here, please.
Mama: Alright Aubrey, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Mama.
Griffin: Uh, you tear it open, and it’s an eviction notice!
Kirby: Desperate times call for desperate measures, get out in the woods and take some blurry fuckin’ pictures, I don’t know! Whatever people usually do to make Bigfoot stuff happen!
Griffin: Ned, you start planning your next grift. You are going to bring Bigfoot to Kepler!

{1:42}
Griffin: So, we have more scenes this week, and I promise you guys are gonna meet up and the mystery’s gonna start to… unravel itself? But before we get to that, just a couple more sorta setup scenes and our first one is with Duck, again. Hi, Duck! I’m now talking to a fictional character, so I’m not really sure how that works.
Justin: It’s actually pretty weird, I’ll just address you as Justin. Hello, Griffin.
Griffin: So, Duck, you’ve been following the trail of this… thing, whatever it is, for an hour and a half now. You’ve mostly been pursuing the sort of drops of black ooze that, as they reach deeper into the forest, they glint off of your flashlight’s light, making it surprisingly easy to follow. And it’s at this point in the forest where you’ve been walking about an hour and a half, you’re well away from the trails and the lights of the town, that you actually see another light, shining in your direction from deeper within. And it’s low to the ground, it’s beaming in your direction, cutting through the trees, and this light is not moving. What do you do?
Justin: I guess I approach it.
Griffin: Okay! You… approach the light, and as you do so, your eyes kind of adjust to it, and this scene reveals itself to you. The light you spotted earlier is actually a flashlight that is laying on the forest floor, it’s like half-submerged in a little muddy patch. And it was left on and dropped. But what’s more notable in this area is the forest floor itself. There’s large patches of the ground where the grass is just blackened in this strange pattern, almost like it was burnt. There’s big splotches here and there of burnt, you think, grass, and each of those splotches has a few smaller lengths of burnt grass extending off of them. And, there’s another sort of strange thing here, too, and that’s: there’s just, like… no sound. The sort of ambient sound of crickets and frogs and the occasional hoot from an owl, there’s none of that there. The night has become just completely still in this place. Which is why it freaks you out all the more when you hear a voice… that you haven’t heard in many, many years, say:
Presence: Duck Newton! The moment of your destiny has arrived!
Griffin: And there, standing before you, is... a presence, and it’s a presence you first saw… some number of years ago, and that’s something we’re gonna have to figure out together. She, like you saw so many years ago, she has no real features that you can make out, she’s just sort of this outline of a person made of this faint blue light? She’s roughly about six feet tall, with a long neck ending in a large, seemingly bald head, and that’s all that you’re really able to make out, looking at her. And I guess it’s kind of time that we talk about Duck’s… visions that he gets as part of The Chosen, which you and I kinda briefly talked about, and you gave the okay on sort of being represented by this person that would visit Duck from time to time. Let’s take this moment actually to sort of talk about Duck’s destiny… which sounds a lot like Duck Dynasty.
Travis: Yeah! Eugh!
Griffin: Yikes! When did Duck sort of first become aware of his role as The Chosen? When was, like, the last time you saw this vision, ‘cause it’s been a while.
Justin: On his… 18th birthday.
Griffin: Okay. And when—
Justin: And it happened for a while after that, I mean, a few weeks. And then maybe occasionally after, y’know, once or twice a month, but, I think- I feel like they became… the way I’m seeing is, is they were very— it was, like, very clear at the beginning, and then the longer it sort of went on, more sort of ephemeral and maybe almost dreamlike—
Clint: Were they dreams? Were they comin’ to him in dreams, or actively just…
Justin: No, no, I think maybe that is what he has convinced himself? But I think it’s closer to what Griffin describes, it was a presence that visited him and said these things and then… y’know, I think that eventually over time, you can convince yourself of a lot of stuff. He convinced himself that it was just that, just dreams.
Griffin: I love that idea, of it being dreamlike, and that this happened so long ago— ‘cause we should also talk about- you talked about Duck being, like, not, like, a kid? Like, older than 20s?
Justin: Yeah, he’s mid-40s now.
Griffin: Mid-forties, and so it’s probably been long enough now that you’ve kind of convinced yourself it was just a dream, or something. But that probably makes it even all the more alarming that here she is again, and she says:
Presence: There is no more time to delay, Duck Newton. Events have been put into motion that require your immediate action.
Duck: All right.
Justin: And I turn heel and start walking away.
Presence: Duck Newton, wait! I must know if you’ve been training your body to achieve and maintain peak physical capabilities, Duck Newton!
Duck: Well, I...you know what I did try that, uh...crossfit. Darren opened up one of them crossfit places, they do BAIT during the day and then during the evenings they got CrossFit.
Clint: [laughs] BAIT and CrossFit!
Duck: And I tried it, I’ll be honest that was a little... (trails off)
Presence: And did you master this martial art of crossed fit, Duck Newton?
Duck: Well, the first class was free, but honestly the way my schedule is sometimes, I didn’t think I’d be able to dedicate as much time as it required to really make the membership pay off. You know how it goes.
Griffin: This vision sort of disappears and reappears like, right next to you, and now she’s like looking you over. And she says:
Presence: Where is your Chosen weapon, Duck Newton? Where is the instrument of your destiny?
Duck: I, uh, [clicks tongue] you know what, honestly, it kinda creeped me out, so I uh, I had a friend hold on to it. It was kind of just, I’ll be honest, it kinda wigged me out, you know. I mean, I don’t know, I’m not even gonna say I have a design aesthetic, but uh, weird bendy sword doesn’t exactly fit whatever it is that I’m trying to achieve. You know how it goes.
Griffin: She says:
Presence: Duck Newton, I know well of your hesitance. But you must know that I have waited long enough. It is now the time—
Griffin: And you hear a sound in the woods, just like several dozen feet away. You hear the snapping of a big branch. And then you hear this deep, monstrous sigh. And then another, and another, like, steady breathing now and it’s moving closer to you. And this vision says:
Presence: Duck Newton, are you in dange—?
Griffin: And then the vision disappears. What do you do?
Justin: I feel like there’s a lot of this stuff that is… I feel like whatever quote unquote abilities Duck had have become rather rusty. But I still feel like his, maybe, stuff is better than it would be for a regular person. So I feel like he has an ability to sort of like, sense danger.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Or sense enemies coming that’d go beyond what regular people could do. So I think he kind of is able to train in on whatever is coming after him and try to read the situation.
Griffin: You think this is a Read a Bad Situation then?
Justin: I do. It seems like a bad situation to me.
[crosstalk]
Griffin: [amused] Yeah, I would definitely say it’s a bad situation.
Justin: And one in dire need of being read.
Griffin: Yeah, go ahead and do it.
[Justin rolls]
Justin: Five, three, plus Sharp. It’s a nine.
Griffin: Okay, mixed result. Hold one. You get to ask me one question: What’s the best way in? What’s the best way out? Are there any dangers you haven’t noticed? What’s the biggest threat? What’s most vulnerable to me? And what’s the best way to protect the victims?
Justin: I would probably ask what’s the biggest threat?
Griffin: It is… I will give you two things with that. The first thing you notice as you kind of turn your light towards the sound, is you get a clear picture of this pattern of burnt grass on the ground, which you couldn’t really see until you’re, at your current position, shining your light over the whole of it. And it’s not just like random splotches of burnt grass, it almost looks like the shadows of animals. You can see kinda clearly like, they’re all kinda jumbled up but you can kinda see like a deer? Like a shape of a deer on the ground. A couple of them actually. And you see the shape of either a dog or a wolf kinda like sticking out of the mass of the pile. And the other thing you notice, that is sort of more relevant to you, is that you faintly see the shape that Pigeon described to you. You see a hulking, eight-foot shape that is moving towards you, and as you shine the light in its direction, you catch eyes with the light. I think actually you get two eyes, sort of where you expect eyes on this thing to be, and very very faintly you also catch a couple of other eyes in places that maybe eyes shouldn’t be. And as you flash it, you hear this shape roar, and now it’s moving towards you very quickly.
Justin: Alright, I raise the hunting rifle in my hands, and I chuck it at its head as hard as I can before I sprint away.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Um, yeah, so there is a Fight thing. This is absolutely not that. Not kicking some ass.
[crosstalk]
Justin: No, this is Act Under Pressure, I feel like.
Griffin: Yeah, go ahead and roll plus Cool.
[Justin rolls]
Justin: Five.
Griffin: Wuh-oh.
Travis: How cool is Duck?
Griffin: Mark experience.
[laughter]
Justin: You guys try fucking acting under pressure when a multi-eyed demon is coming at you. I don’t blame him.
Griffin: So I get to make a hard move, ‘cause you fucked up. Mark experience, which is good. Every time you fail, you mark experience.
Justin: Hey, experience.
Travis: That’s a hearty balm.
[crosstalk]
Justin: [to Clint] Papa, can you get that orange pencil out of that highlighter mug for me, thank you.
Clint: [in a Yoda impression] Learn from failure, we do.
Justin: One big experience.
[Travis and Griffin laugh]
Justin: Goes down smooth, boys, let me tell ya.
Griffin: Alright, here’s what I’m gonna do to you. You throw the hunting rifle, so that’s gone now, you just lose that. And you try to turn tail and run. And you are just not fast enough. This thing that is marching out of the woods collides with you with, I think, just a big ol’ paw, just swipes you and knocks you to the ground. And you roll about 10 feet away. As you roll a couple of your things also come off. This is a price you are paying for fucking up this bad. First off, take two harm, as you are swatted by this big big monster.
Justin: Okay, so no harm. I’m Invincible.
Griffin: What?
Justin: I’m Invincible. I always count as having two armor.
Griffin: Ohhhh. That’s a Chosen thing?
Justin: Yeah, it’s my big Chosen ability.
Griffin: I think, so like, in fiction—
[crosstalk]
Travis: Sick!
Griffin: What is that? Do you just have like a magic sort of warding presence? Is this just representative of Duck being like—
Justin: I’m just tough. I don’t get hurt.
Travis: Like Buffy. You know Buffy can take a lot of—
Justin: It’s nothing like Buffy, this is a new IP [laughter] and I’m not gonna write any fucking checks. He just is—
[crosstalk]
Griffin: Alright, you—
Justin: Why does it have to be Buffy? Lots of people are difficult to damage.
Travis: Yeah.
Clint: He could just be buff.
Justin: No, he’s no… there’s no buff sounds. There’s not even a B. It’s just Duck Newton, guy who’s hard to kill.
Griffin: Alright, yeah, you’re hard to kill. You get swatted away and you don’t take any damage. But there is still a cost, and that is as you roll, you lose your flashlight and your radio.
Justin: Man, I already lost a gun, that seems excessive. But alright.
Griffin: It’s a hard move, I can base… you are at my whims at that point, and—
Justin: Alright. I’m a fan… who am I? [mocking/quoting Griffin] I’m a fan of your character.
Griffin: Yeah, alright.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: But this big monster is kind of a little unsteady as it charges into you and does this attack. It, like, keeps going for a little bit. And your, I’ll say this, your flashlight as it lands, kind of close to the other flashlight that was already on the ground, it is shining into this big, sort of, bramble patch. And inside you see a scared face of a young man wearing some coke-bottle glasses, and a blue sweater, and he’s hiding out in this bramble patch as the monster sort of charges. And the monsters has its back to you for just a brief moment. What do you do?
Justin: [laughs] I have nothing, right?
Griffin: You are essentially now unequipped.
Justin: [whispers] God.
Griffin: What I love about this game is that there are, it gives me so many more options of putting you guys in legitimate danger. And this is definitely one of those situations.
Justin: I’m gonna [laughs] I’m trying to think what he would do in this situation, and the answer is he would not kick some ass, but kick its ass. Kick its literal ass. Kick its ass.
Griffin: With—
Justin: I’m gonna kick- I’m gonna kick it in the ass.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Uh, okay, you kick it in its ass.
Justin: Normally this is not what Duck would be doing, by the way, but there, this is somebody who is visiting the park, and they are in danger, and he’s not gonna just, like, leave ‘em. So he’s gonna kick this thing in the ass.
Griffin: You kick it in its ass, and it very, I mean, you just do it. I don’t think this is a Kick Some Ass roll, because it sort of has its back to you, and it like, doesn’t even register it, really, as hurting. But it turns around quickly and now is facing you, and now you have its attention with this sort of scared guest at the park hiding nearby. What do you do?
Justin: Are any of the items that I have misplaced, are any of them like within arms reach theoretic— like where I could get to them before this thing could get to me, theoretically.
Griffin: I think if you were about to, like, turn tail and run this thing away from this victim, I think you could take a beat to pick up one of them. Either the rifle or the radio or the flashlight. But I would need you to roll Cool. I would need you to roll to Act Under Pressure.
Justin: [makes exasperated sound] All right.
Griffin: You don’t have to. You don’t have to.
Justin: No, I’m just- no, I’m thinking. I’m just trying to think what would be—
Griffin: Let me also give you this. The monster doesn’t seem to see this other person as they are hidden right now. Right now. That could change, but this person’s hiding.
Justin: Okay, I’ll grab the radio.
Griffin: Okay, I need you to Act Under Pressure.
[Justin rolls]
Justin: Okay, there we go. Finally a decent one. I got an eight.
Griffin: I’m going to offer you a hard choice.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: On a mixed- which is something I can do on a mixed success. You can get it, this thing’s gonna hit you again.
Justin: Uh, yeah, I’ll do that. Sure.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: He’s tough!
Griffin: You sort of roll out of the way of one of this things swipes, and as you roll you grab the radio and then you feel something at your back as the monster hits you with another swipe, this time for two damage. And this time you go flying about 20 feet, so you are not damaged, but you are now in the woods as this thing knocks you away. And you scramble to your feet, and now this thing is starting to pursue you away from this scene. What do you do?
Justin: I turn up the volume on the receiver as loud as it’ll go.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: As I’m running away I start yelling.
Duck: Come in, we got an emergent situation, I have a… God, alright, unknown assailant and—
Griffin: Are you saying this as you’re sprinting away from this—
Justin: Yes.
Griffin: Okay.
Duck: I’m just north of the Cranberry River, and uh, I need immediate- I guess, air support. I know it’s gonna be too long for y’all to get out here but I’m sorta making an immediate egress away to the south. South, yeah, south. I’m headed towards the river. So just follow the river and you’ll see me. Please confirm very loudly that you heard.
Griffin: [laughs] You are getting some static on the radio.
Justin: Alright, I adjust the squelch knob so I can try to limit that and get the signal clear.
Griffin: You’re doing a lot of this in… I’m trying to figure out a way to make this fair, cuz you’re doing a lot of this in the dark while running away from a big bear monster.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: So I think this is just another Act Under Pressure as you are trying to like tune on this thing as you are running through the woods.
Justin: Uh, seven.
Griffin: Seven, mixed success. Okay, you hear a voice say.
Ranger: [extremely muffled] I can’t hear you. Duck? Duck, come in.
Duck: Yeah, I’m here!
Griffin: And now that static is getting kind of louder now, and it’s not like this is another national quiet zone thing where you do have trouble sometimes picking up signals. This ain’t that. Like, something weird is almost jamming the signal and you hear someone saying:
Ranger: [muffled] Alright, we’re gonna send out someone to try and find you, Duck. Where… Duck? I can’t hear you, Duck.
Griffin: And the price to pay for your mixed success is after getting confirmation on this, you trip over a branch, and now the radio’s just gone. You have no idea where it went. And this thing is still pursuing you. And I think you’re just running now in the dark for a while. And running away from this monster in the dark and there’s— you can hear it close behind you and some branches are whipping up against your invincible face as you are running and running and eventually the sound of that monster gets quieter and quieter and now it’s just gone. And you are sort of safe, you feel safe, and you don’t have a flashlight anymore, but you’re in a clearing. And the moonlight overhead is brilliant and shining straight down like a spotlight on the center of this clearing, where you see that big stone gate.
{music 21:41-21:55}
Griffin: And we’re gonna move on to Aubrey.
Travis: Hell yeah!
Griffin: Aubrey, Mama is driving you down a scenic stretch of highway, on the road out of Snowshoe, and dusk is falling and the leaves in the woods sort of lining the road that you’re on have just begun to fall. It’s the end of summer and they’ve sort of begun their natural patterns. And you are relieved to hear that no police sirens are following you down this road. [Travis: Sweet.] And Mama notices you nervously looking behind you and she says:
Mama: Now, you don’t worry too much about the fuzz, okay? I’ve got some pull with the owners of that hotel, that gaudy shithole.
Aubrey: Oh, okay, great.
Mama: They ain’t gonna bother you none.
Aubrey: Well, that leads me to my next question then, I guess. So, are you gonna kill me or what?
Mama: No-
Aubrey: Is this like, “You’re driving me somewhere and you’re gonna murder me” kinda thing? What… who the fuck are you, I guess, is now my immediate concern.
Griffin: She says:
Mama: I’m not planning on murderin’ you, that’s sorta not my MO.
Aubrey: That would be exactly what someone who was planning to murder me would say.
Griffin: She kinda smiles as you say that, and she actually reaches one of her huge hands into her duster’s breast pocket. And I think you get nervous just because of the context of the situation. But what she pulls out is actually a small ziploc bag that she sort of rips open with her teeth.
Travis: Weed!
Griffin: And she reaches inside and uncurls her fist towards you to reveal a baby carrot. And she says:
Mama: Doc says I gotta eat these for my ticker, I figured your little buddy might be hungry.
Aubrey: Um, I’m sorry? My little buddy?
Mama: Your magic rabbit. Dr. Bonkers.
Aubrey: Thank you. Thank you for using his name and title. He worked hard to get that PhD.
Griffin: And I think Dr. Bonkers like, I don’t know where he is, where you’ve got him, but he kinda springs forward and is kinda resting on your arm, and takes this baby carrot and starts nibbling on it. And she says:
Mama: This is gonna be kind of a strange question maybe, but, you really are human, aren’t you?
Aubrey: [hesitantly] Yes?
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: She says:
Mama: I did warn you it was gonna be a strange question.
Aubrey: Fair. Yeah. Alright, yeah. Human on my mother and father’s side. Is that an… is that an option?
Griffin: She laughs and she says:
Mama: Yeah, and you’re gonna learn a lot of stuff tonight I think, and one of ‘em is that it is definitely, definitely an option. What I don’t understand is how you’re able to use magic if you don’t know the truth of the matter.
Aubrey: Oh, um, well, it’s a lot of flash paper and these gloves have strikers in ‘em.
Mama: Yeah, that’s all great, but- we can’t keep doin’ this, it’s gonna make sense here in a little bit. And you’ve really never been to Kepler before?
Aubrey: Not that I know of.
Griffin: She says:
Mama: Well, that’s a shame. ‘Cause… it’s the best town on Earth.
Griffin: And as she says that your truck passes through one last stretch of woods, and then the trees disappear, and there’s Kepler. And you’re on the riverside of town now, named for the lower part of the town’s proximity to the Greenbrier River that cuts across its southern border. And the highway you’re on turns into the town’s main road and suddenly you’re passing through this quaint little town’s center. You pass a building called The Cryptonomica, you pass a local grocer, an arcade, a winter sports supply store, a Pizza Hut, a much smaller neighboring independent pizza restaurant. A library, city hall and a bunch of other buildings that you can’t really identify. And then you—
Travis: Is it fair to assume that the smaller restaurant is a Giovanni’s? Or—
Griffin: Yeah, we can say it’s a Gino’s, or a Giovanni’s. And then you’re driving through a few residential— by the way, that’s some hyper-local Huntington, West Virginia callbacks but… [Clint laughs] then you’re driving through a few residential blocks before the road turns back into the highway at the town’s edge. But Mama takes a hairpin left turn and now you’re driving up this winding road that climbs the face of the mountain sort of to the town’s north. You drive under an overpass and you see the town’s funicular train with a couple of passengers riding from riverside up to topside, which the road that you’re on turns into as you reach sort of the end of the winding road’s end, and now you’re passing by some other buildings. There’s the Kepler ski trails landing, a few ritzy-looking chalets on the cliff’s edge and some alpine inspired resorts. And then Mama reaches the end of the road, and she turns one last time onto a small, dirt path, leading into a forest of pine trees. And you drive through this secluded stretch for a half-minute or so, and then—
Aubrey: Okay, so just real quick I wanna circle back on the “Not going to murder me” thing, right? We could have stopped at Giovanni’s back there. That would have been fine.
Griffin: She says:
Mama: Oh, are you hungry? You want some carrots?
Aubrey: No.
Mama: I can getcha a hot meal here in a little bit, but… oh! Not in a little bit.
Griffin: And she rolls the truck to a stop and she turns off the engine and she says:
Mama: We’re here.
Griffin: And where “here” is, where this truck has parked, is in front of a large building at the end of this dirt road, with a wooden sign hanging over the entrance that reads Amnesty Lodge. [music starts playing] There’s a wooden plank path cutting through a charming, well-tended garden, and up to this geodesic wooden dome that serves as the lodge’s central lobby. And branching off either side of that central hub are the lodge’s two guest wings, which have sort of a natural log-cabin aesthetic, with these lamplit verandas peeking out of each room. And Mama leads you into that lobby, where a few guests are seated in handcrafted wooden chairs, one is reading a newspaper. A couple are laughing over a game of chess. One is dusting the surface of a piano.
In the rear of this lobby is a large open space with windows looking outward into the woods with dining tables scattered about, with chairs sort of stacked upside down on top of them as dinner service isn’t really running right now. There’s a cut-out window in this dining space into a small kitchen, there’s this kind of faint smell of sulfur in the air, and you notice that there’s a small sign hanging in the entrance to one of those guest wings directing guests to a hot spring behind the building. And there’s a large hearth in the middle of this room, and it’s unlit, but just being in this building, just being in the Amnesty Lodge, you feel warm. And a young blond man dressed in snowboarder’s gear comes running out of the wings towards the entrance. Mama intercepts him and says:
Mama: Well don’t go out tonight, Jake, I need you to make up a room for our new guest.
Travis: Jake Coolice? [pronounced “cool ice”] Or whatever his name is?
Griffin: Yeah, it is Jake Coolice.
Clint: Jaaake!
Griffin: And he flashes a hang-ten, and he says:
Jake Coolice: No problem, Mama.
Griffin: And he retreats back into that guest wing.
Aubrey: Oh, I hate him. Who was that?
[Clint laughs]
Mama: You hate— nobody hates Jake Coolice.
Aubrey: I hate him.
Griffin: [crosstalk] When you say that, everybody, all the guests like look to you with a start. “Did she just say she hates Jake Coolice?”
Aubrey: I was just kidding, it’s… woah, [brightly] hey! This is Dr. Harris Bonkers.
Clint: [laughs] Who can defuse any situation.
Travis: Yeah, Dr. Harris Bonkers is kind of Aubrey’s, like, go-to, “Did you see this rabbit?”
Griffin: Yeah. Mama says:
Mama: So, uh...are you hungry? I can see if Barclay’s around to whip you up some food.
Aubrey: Um, you know, let’s talk about my hierarchy of needs. Right now, I just kinda wanna know what’s going on. Um, then burger.
Griffin: She says:
Mama: Yeah, that’s probably a good order of operations there. Alright, well, first things first, hey—
Aubrey: Oh actually, I need a bathroom first. You know, long car trip. First thing I do when I get to a hotel…
Griffin: She says:
Mama: Yeah, alright, you can use the one in the lobby.
Griffin: She gestures over to a bathroom door with a toilet sign hanging on it. She says:
Mama: Go for it, but then I promise I’m gonna explain everything that’s goin’ on.
Travis: Aubrey goes to the bathroom and comes back. Just, no one ever goes to the bathroom and stuff, and so, I just—
[clapping]
Griffin: [amused] I thought you were setting up some sort of—
Travis: No. I just—
Griffin: Aubrey makes a bomb out of the bathroom supplies, just in case.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: No, Aubrey comes to the bathroom and comes back.
Griffin: Alright.
Travis: It’s an actual human function.
Griffin: Mama says:
Mama: How’d it go in there?
Aubrey: It was great. Thank you for asking. Now... what the fuck?
Griffin: She says:
Mama: Alright, now first things first, hey Dani, I need you to see somethin’.
Griffin: And the guest reading the newspaper puts it down and you see sort of a young, earthy looking woman, kinda crunchy-looking woman with long blonde hair, and she’s looking up from the newspaper and she’s staring at you, Aubrey. And Mama walks over to the hearth in the center of the room and she pulls away this grate surrounding it. She says:
Mama: Alright, Aubrey. Show us what you can do. And I mean the real stuff, not the flash paper stuff.
Travis: This is very important, and I know you’re gonna try to dismiss it at first. Is Dani cute?
Griffin: Uh, yeah? Yeah, I think, I mean does Aubrey find her cute? I feel like that would be, I don’t know what—
Travis: Yes, she does, that’s why I asked. ‘Cause I want to know if Aubrey’s nervous or not performing in front of Dani.
Griffin: Okay, then yes, absolutely.
Travis: Okay, because I kind of think like, in a very traditional...so basing this off of… I’m very inspired by Harry Dresden for this, a lot of, like, the Dresden kind of magic, and magic in general is like inspired by emotion and channelling will and emotion, that kinda thing. And so one of the reasons I think it sparks for Aubrey while she’s performing is, you know, that rush of endorphins of like, in front of a crowd and the nervousness—
Griffin: [crosstalk] I think that’s really rad. I also think if we make that canon that your emotional state sort of affects your magic, you can use that in some cool ways, and I’m also gonna use that in some cool, maybe bad for you, ways. Okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, absolutely. That’s why I picked Fire and Blast and all of that, cuz I think Aubrey is very emotional, very reactive, and I want that to be part of it, you know what I mean? ‘Cuz I also think, as you said, it can be both beneficial and detrimental.
Griffin: The term “very emotional” feels kind of weighted. I—
Travis: Not “very emotional,” that’s not what I mean. She is heart-on-her-sleeve, open, you know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Whereas, I think, like Nadiya that I played is like very introspective.
Griffin: Yeah, sure I got ya.
Travis: That ain’t Aubrey.
Griffin: So if you’re using just your basic fire magic I think this would just be your move, right? Your Spell-Slinger thing.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: We should make it clear, just for the future, that The Spell-Slinger has, essentially, instead of like a main attack, they have a magical attack, but that is different from Use Magic, which is a sort of contextual… there’s a bunch of different effects. But if you’re trying to set something on fire, I feel like it would be The Spell-Slinger’s fire attack, which is what you’ve got.
Travis: Mmhm. Am I doing my plus Weird roll, then?
Griffin: It’s definitely gonna be a plus Weird roll. I guess the question is, is this an attack on the fireplace, or is this a magical effect?
Travis: Well, okay, I think, first time out, Aubrey would cheat and use her, like, magician shit.
Griffin: Alright, well then you don’t roll plus Weird. You just do it.
[Travis rolls]
Travis: Uh, it’s a six. Oh, okay.
Griffin: No, I’m saying you don’t have to… if you’re not using your actual magic, if you are using flash p- and this is also something we should set in stone, if you’re just using your, if you’re doing a trick, I don’t think it’s a magic roll.
Travis: Oh, okay.
Griffin: I think it’s just you do it.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: So you produce a bit of flash paper with your spark gloves, which is, like, the way that you are accustomed to doing this. And just a little flash of a flame appears and hits the logs in the center of the hearth and it doesn’t really ignite. And Mama kinda sighs and she says:
Mama: No... Aubrey?
Aubrey: Yes?
Mama: Not- not the David Copperfield shit. I’m talkin’ about the—
Aubrey: Ew, gross!
Mama: Okay, not the—
Aubrey: You go to Copperfield?!
Mama: No, it’s just that it was the first thing that popped in mind, I’m talkin’… Aubrey? The real stuff.
Aubrey: Okay, um… real... magic? Okay.
Travis: So I guess Aubrey, like, stares at the fire and, like, starts, you know, doing the deep breathing stuff..
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Um… [rolls] oh, okay, that’s fairly good. That’s a nine plus two. Eleven.
Griffin: Okay, then I think, I love this picture of Aubrey, just like with her hands extended, this is not, she’s not doing sleight of hand right now, so she doesn’t know how to cast actual magic spells, so she doesn’t really know how to produce it. It’s like that scene in Spiderman, where he’s like “Go web, go!” It’s like that, where you don’t really exactly know what to do.
Travis: [crosstalk] But I will say, following her moves, just from habit she’s still moving her hands the same way she would conjure fake—
Griffin: Okay. What I think—
Travis: Because she has to use gestures, foci, consumables, to use spells.
Griffin: What I think the great resolution to this is: you catch Dani out of the corner of your eye, and you get a little nervous for a second, and then a big blast of fire appears in your hands.
Travis: Yes. Very much so.
Griffin: And with that, I think the fire is perfectly contained, almost like it’s a blast of fire that sort of occupies just the space of this hearth. And suddenly the hearth is ablaze, and Dani kinda sits up in her chair when she sees this, and Mama says:
Mama: So, so Dani what do you think, is this gonna--
Aubrey: Holy shit!
Mama: Yeah.
Griffin: She says:
Mama: Dani, is this what I think it is?
Aubrey: Did you do that?
Mama: No, Aubrey, you did that.
Aubrey: Holy shit!
Griffin: So she says:
Mama: Dani, what do you think? Is this what I think it is?
Griffin: And Dani says:
Aubrey: Did you see that?!
Mama: Yeah.
[laughter]
Aubrey: Holy shit!
Griffin: Dani says:
Dani: Yeah it, uh, it sure seems that way.
Griffin: And Mama nods, and she swiftly walks to the front door of the Amnesty Lodge and she bolts it. And she turns back toward you. And now everybody in the lobby has sort of stopped doing what they’re doing and they’re looking at you, and Mama says:
Mama: Alright, Aubrey Little, what do you wanna know?
{music 36:47-37:04}
{commercial break 37:04-40:05}
{music 40:05-40:12}
Griffin: Ned. It is nearing dusk, and you’re out in the Monongahela National Forest, and you brought your big boat of a car. What is it, a Lincoln Continental Mark III? Is that what it is?
Clint: It is a Lincoln Continental Mark III, 1958 biggest trunk space of any American-made car.
Griffin: Yeah, you bring that big car to a halt in these woods and you kinda survey the scene, there’s nobody around, you’ve probably driven off the trail a little bit, to get somewhere where you will not be really interrupted while you do your work. And speaking of that big trunk, what’s in it? Cuz I wanna know, what are you doing to stage this Bigfoot thing?
Travis: What kinda junk do you have in your trunk?
Griffin: Well I wanna know specifically, like, what are you doing to create this Bigfoot exhibit? Cuz I don’t wanna paint you into a corner if you wanna, like, cast some big footprints, or you wanna take a fake picture. I love the Wookiee costume idea and we did set that up in episode one, but I know you’ve had a little bit more time to think about it what are you doin’ to get this Bigfoot exhibit?
Clint: Um, well obviously I’m going to try to fake a little bit of footage, I’ve got these very very heavy boots and it’s an old, they were originally just great big snowshoes.
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: But he has attached to them this kinda mold, so it’ll look like a great big paw print, but it’s gonna be huge.
Griffin: So you’re wearing magic shoes.
Justin: Sorry, and the Wookiee costume?
Clint: I’ve got those on, I’ve got the Wookiee costume on, I’m sorry purists, but I did not bring the bandolier, I thought that might throw some people off.
Justin: I love this.
Griffin: Alright, yeah, that’s too much.
Clint: I strap these great big boots, like snowshoes with the handles cut off, and these big latex things to look like giant footprints, but I mean they’re like y’know… [pauses] 20 inches, so I’m not gonna be able to move real fast. And I’ve got a camera.
Griffin: Yeah, I think it’s probably Kirby’s camera that he uses for the paper that he loaned out to you.
Clint: Right, and I’ve got it on a tripod, and I’ve also brought along, I had, don’t ask me how, but I had this big vat that I went and got right directly out of the cesspool in the backyard, and it’s just filled with this nasty sewage schmeggy stuff and it’s—
Travis: Why?
Clint: Well, just bear with me, and I’ve got it in this great big, like gallon—
Travis: He’s making Bigfoot dookie.
Clint: Jug. I’m making Bigfoot scent. The spoor, the spoor is gonna be on the wind tonight.
Travis: Jesus Christ.
Justin: [crosstalk] This should be pretty good.
Clint: So let’s see the marketers create something outta that.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Anything else in the trunk?
Clint: Well, my walking stick, but I don’t think that’d be a very good idea for me to carry my walking stick.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Alright, sure. Well, let’s say you’re setting up the camera and you get it sort of angled toward a thick patch of these pine trees.
Clint: Right.
Griffin: That are just, they’re just everywhere, they’re just sort of the defining arboreal characteristic of Kepler are these tall pines. And you get a good sorta angle where you could be hidden, a little bit, ‘cause you still want that air of mystery. If the footage is, like, Bigfoot right up against you then it’s pretty easy to be like, “Oh, well that’s bullshit.” So you set up that camera and, I don’t even think we have to roll for it I do just wanna play it out, though. So what do you do?
Clint: So I set up the camera, and I can’t make the buttons work while I got the gloves on, so I take the gloves off. It’s really hard ‘cuz it’s a really complicated camera, so there’s a lot of [yells] “Damn it!” So finally I get the camera, I’ve got it on a video setting.
Griffin: Alright.
Clint: And I pull the gloves back on, and I walk, and I set it at a stationary point. I’ve already, you know, sprinkled probably half of the cesspool, the Bigfoot spoor, musk, whatever I’m gonna pretend it is, in various locations around there. And so I step out of frame, and I’m getting myself psyched up. I’m thinking back on my dramatic training, you know, and I’m kinda singing to myself, to get my, y’know—
Griffin: Yeah. Sure.
Clint: [sings Into the Woods] The way is clear, the light is good. I’m getting all pumped up, and then I roll my shoulders up and I kinda hunch up, and I start to lumber, you know, I lumber into the shot, and I walk around and I’m making an effort to keep my face kind of away from the—
Griffin: Are you wearing a mask?
Clint: Oh I got my Wookiee head, my Wookiee head’s on.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I got the Wookiee head on. I used a little bit of makeup to, like, put weird markings on it. I’ve streaked the wookie fur. I mean, you know, it’s not gonna be so obvious to be like, Peter Mayhew.
Griffin: Sure.
Clint: And I’m lumbering, and I’m making a [growls].
Griffin: Do you get the… I feel like we got the scene. Do you get it in one take? Or, whats… do you get it in one? Are you one-take Ned?
Clint: Well, I take a one, but then I didn’t like my motivation, and I really didn’t like the voice, so I’m setting up and I blur it up a little bit. It was a little bit too in-focus, you know.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: So I take a little bit out of focus, and I’m lumbering, and here I got again, and I’m set, ready, and go. And I lumber a little bit more threatening, now I look a little bit more, you know, bestial.
Griffin: Got it.
Clint: And I’m making a different noise, I’m trying out [makes more high-pitched animal noise]
Griffin: Let’s say that’s the magic take, you get the—
Clint: [crosstalk] That’s good, that’s a ten.
Griffin: The light is, it’s the golden hour, the light is perfect.
Clint: I step out of the frame and I say:
Ned: And scene.
Griffin: And that’s where we are, I think you pop your mask off, and you’re looking at the footage on the LCD display on the back of the camera, and you’re looking at the footage, and you’re feeling pretty good about it. It looks like you did a great job of sort of making it visible, but not like, too clear. And you got your mask off and you’re looking at this footage, and it is while you are looking at this footage that you see a figure emerge from the woods. You see a guy pop out from behind… not pop out to like surprise you, he’s just walking, but you see him.
Clint: Do I notice him, could I notice him in the playback first?
Griffin: No, I don’t think he was that close to you.
Clint: Oh, okay.
Griffin: I think you got good, clean, fake Bigfoot footage. But you see this man walk out of the woods, and he’s tall and kinda burly, he’s wearing a flannel shirt. He’s got a scruffy beard, he’s walking kinda slowly, with intent, and he’s got his arms stuck out. And you can see, dangling from his closed fist, there’s this chain with a faintly glowing orange crystal at the end of it. And he’s paying rapt attention to this pendant that he’s holding until he spots you. And he clumsily tries to, sorta, nonchalantly pull it back up into his hand to hide it, and this man says:
Man: Oh, hey. Hi. Hello, other— other person. You’re… here. And that’s great. Hi.
Ned: Hail, friend. W-w-what are you doing?
Man: What are you— What’s, why are you dressed up like Chewbacca, it looks like, maybe, a little bit.
Ned: Um, I’m getting in on this fan-film thing, you know how fans make, uh… films, to try and get noticed by film studios.
Man: Cool, I love Star Wars, yeah.
Ned: Yeah, and so I thought, “Hey, make a Chewbacca, you know, fan film, and maybe—” [laughs]
Man: So you’re by yourself in the woods out here in the middle of the night?
Ned: Yes, well, you know, keep it streamlined, you know, keep it small. Cut out the middleman, make yourself a ton of money. At the very least they may pay you a bunch of money, you know, to not put out the product, so.
Man: Cool.
Ned: Just a little Youtube, fol-de-rol. [Laughs]
Griffin: This man looks kind of nervous. Just as you kind of didn’t anticipate seeing anybody out in the woods tonight, you get the sense that he also did not anticipate seeing anybody else out in the woods tonight. And he says:
Man: So you, uh planning on sticking around for much longer?
Ned: [laughs] No, no, no, deadlines and commitments, you know? I’ve gotta get back on my computer and look at variety.com and of course we’ve got editing and post-production and everything else so no, I’m just gonna put this equipment right here in my big old trunk and get the hell outta here.
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: Well, alright, it was nice to meet ya, my name’s Barclay, by the way. What’s yours?
Ned: Barclay, hey, Barclay. Oh! The cook from the lodge, correct?
Griffin: He flashes a smile and he’s like:
Barclay: I don’t remember seeing you at the lodge, I dunno. Yeah I mean, that’s my job. What’s your name?
Ned: You fixed me a Monte Cristo there once. Absolutely delicious. And Ned. Ned Chicane.
Barclay: Oh, Ned. Yes, yes.
Ned: I own the Cryptonomica.
Barclay: Oh yeah, that’s why I recognize you. Alright, well it’s nice to, I guess, formally meet you. Now you’re gonna... you were just leaving, you were saying?
Griffin: And as he says that, from out in the woods, almost actually directly behind where you were filming your footage, you see a figure kind of skulking toward you. And as it does, you actually see that crystal that Barclay’s trying to hide in his fist, you see it kind of shining through the cracks in his fingers. And there’s something wrong with this figure that’s skulking out of the woods. It’s moving kind of unnaturally, it’s neck is, like, cocked to the side. It has this trail of black ooze kind of streaming out of its mouth, and though it’s moving, its face looks kind of lifeless. But all that aside, you recognize this figure because you’ve lived in the mountains of West Virginia long enough. It’s a bobcat.
{51:05}
Griffin: Duck, you have walked these woods more days than nearly every other living human being. You’ve been doing this long enough that you’ve traversed all over, but for reasons beyond your understanding, you’ve never stood at this spot and seen this stone archway. It’s a humble thing, it’s just two slabs of solid stone with a third perched on top between them— kind of like the gates of Stonehenge— and the moonlight is shining down on it as the moon reaches its zenith overhead, nearly full. And the air is still again, save for the sounds of that enormous being that just attacked you, in the distance, that’s still sort of rooting through the woods. But it’s pretty far off, that noise. And as you’re looking at this stone gateway shining in the moonlight, that vision appears to you once again, and she’s several feet away from you, and she’s investigating this archway kind of curiously. And she says:
Presence: So this is your connection? Fascinating!
Duck: Sorry, I don’t— I don’t, uh, understand.
Griffin: I think, when you say that, you hear that monster, and now it’s just a little bit louder. Just a little bit closer to you, and this vision in front of you says:
Presence: You are not ready to face your destiny, Duck Newton, and yet you must. The people in the world beyond this gate will be your friends, regardless of what the people of your world try to tell you!
Duck: Um. See, right now I’m in a bit of a pickle. I got a, appears to be some sort of monster, believe it or not, kind of bearin’ down—
Clint: [amused] Bearin’ down!
Duck: —if you will. So I should just head on th…? Will the monster follow me through the gate? It just looks—
Griffin: Uh, no. It wouldn’t. And you just know that, just because it’s not big enough.
Justin: All right. Well, that seems a good a [sic] option as any.
Duck: Um, do you have a permit for this, by the way, or—?
Griffin: I think she just disregards your question. She takes a moment, almost like, uh, like she’s trying to process what you’ve just asked, but doesn’t even understand how to begin answering that, and she says:
Presence: Enter the gateway, Duck Newton! You will be brave, Duck Newton! That is why you—
Griffin: And then she’s gone again, and it’s just you, and the gate, and the monster in the woods behind you.
Justin: All right. I mean, I guess I run through the gate.
Griffin: You hear the sound of the monster getting louder and louder, and you run towards this empty gate. As you do, the moon overhead reaches its absolute zenith, and where you could once see sort of the forest beyond the archway, now you just see this solid plane of dazzling white light. And it rattles you for just a moment, as do the sharp winds that are blowing away from the gate in every direction. But you continue your approach, with your hand nervously outstretched, and your fingers graze the light.
And then we see the woods from above, and we see this circle of light retreat inward almost as quickly as it appeared, until it is no more. And then we see that clearing again, and the air is still, and the evening is quiet, and the archway is empty.
{55:06}
Griffin: Aubrey: what kind of questions do you have for Mama?
Aubrey: [stuttering, a lot] Um. So. I-I-I can magic? Magic is real?
Griffin: She says:
Mama: Yeah, Aubrey, what you did up there tonight was real, actual magic. So I guess that’s the first big thing: magic is real. Because there’s a place that magic comes from. There’s— I’m gonna try to take this slow so that your mind doesn’t literally dissolve, but—there’s another world, one that is connected to our own. And that connection, it’s popped up in so many places around the world throughout time, and right now it’s here in Kepler. And this other world, Aubrey, it’s an incredible place and a dangerous place, and us humans have been crossin’ over into it for, well, as long as we’ve been around, I guess, and we’ve been bringin’ back stories and folktales, which, surprise! They’re mostly true. But—but that connection, Aubrey, it ain’t a one-way thing. They’ve been crossin’ over too.
Griffin: And Mama looks at the guests in this lobby and she nods. And they look kinda nervous for a second, but then one by one they stand up, and they start undoing different accessories: some bracelets, necklaces, a couple of them slip off rings that they’re wearing, and one by one they transform. The two guests seated at the chessboard grow in stature, and grow these thick layers of fur surrounding them, and suddenly they’re just werewolves. The guest that was dusting the piano turns transparent and spectral. And Dani’s skin starts glowing slightly, and her eyes turn this dark orange, and her teeth become long and pointed, and you are suddenly standing in this lobby with a bunch of monsters.
Aubrey: Oh, okay.
Griffin: Mama says:
Mama: You okay? You all right? I know this is a lot.
Aubrey: Yeah, no, I’ve watched movies and TV shows before, so this actually isn’t as surprising as you might think.
Griffin: She kinda laughs and says:
Mama: Most people don’t take this as well, so I’m glad that you are, listen—
Aubrey: Well, it’s one of those things where I’ve always, you know, no matter how skeptical you are about, like, sci-fi and fantasy stuff. There’s also always a part of your mind that’s like “but maaaybe,” and so, this is one of those things where it’s like yeah, okay. Yeah, sure. Sure sure sure.
Griffin: She says:
Mama: So, that’s the truth of the matter. Monsters are real. But as is the case with so many of life’s profound curiosities, well, there’s a lot more to it than just that.
{music}
Griffin: Barclay kinda has his arm at his side. And his hand, the one that wasn’t holding the crystal, his fingers are kind of stretched out, almost like he’s sorta giving you a “Stay back,” and he says out of the side of his mouth, he says:
Barclay: Walk slowly to the car, and go.
Ned: Um, I ordinarily would—
Barclay: Ssshhh.
Ned: [quietly] All right. But you need to come with me, and get in the car. The trunk is already open, all right? Just jump in the trunk and I’ll get behind the steering wheel, and we’ll get out of here.
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: [also speaking softly] Okay, I’m going to start walking backwards slowly, and you do that also.
Griffin: And the two of you start walking backwards slowly, and Barclay steps on a twig that snaps. And as that happens, the bobcat starts charging toward you. And it’s coming at you fast, and Barclay looks at you, and he says:
Barclay: God, I hope you can keep a secret.
[Amnesty theme starts playing]
Griffin: And he starts running towards the bobcat, and he pulls up his shirtsleeve, and you see him untie a hempen bracelet. And in the blink of an eye, this gentle, bearded man you were just talking to disappears, and in his place is Bigfoot.

________________________
Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Griffin: And as you come to, you see a black Imperial Crown Coupe, wrapped around a tree.
Ned: Well, sorry, old friend...
Clint: I gotta run into the woods!
Griffin: It is a note, uh, written on the back of a Cryptonomica postcard?
Boyd: For my cut, not quite even yet. I'll be in touch.
Griffin: As you reach toward the crystal, the prevailing feeling that you have right now, in this moment, is one of absolute certainty that you are dying.
Griffin: Uh, as you fall, you are in a flower bed. Your right eye is now this...dark orange hue?
Minerva: Surely you saw it, Duck. In your vision. The meteor.
Duck: Yeah.
Minerva: It was coming for me.
Minerva: You need to finish what I started. Go to him.
Griffin: You see the face of the person holding this blade.
Griffin: Leo Tarkesian, neighbour and friendly local grocer, clears his throat and says,
Leo: We should probably talk.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: Welcome back to The Adventure Zone: Amnesty, 2019 edition! It has been seven - years since we have recorded an episode...[Justin laughs] Is this the one where we talk about medical history?
[Crosstalk]
Travis: Yes.
Justin: No.
Clint: This is the etiquette one. Right?
Griffin: Yeah, you wouldn't know, because we're four rude mother- motherfudgers.
Travis: [disapprovingly] Griffin!
Justin: [Laughs] Love it. Yes sir!
Travis: Griffin, we've talked about your blue comedy before!
Griffin: Welcome to the blue-collar comedy tour of the podcast. We're four young yokels, Griffin Justin, Travis and...Bob the cable man, and we're so excited to bring to you the Adventure Zone, and...we're gonna play Monster of the Week.
Justin: In this arc. In this arc, four rough and rowdy comedians have been sucked through a portal and are charged with doing uh… battle with the forces of evil. I, of course, play Ron “Tater Salad” White [laughing] And uhm… I’m really excited about this role—
Griffin: [crosstalk] He’s a paladin. [Justin: Paladin.] It’s great.
Travis: I play Jeff Foxworthy, who is in this universe an actual fox. An anthropomorphic fox-man.
Griffin: And Ron White should be known in his paladin name is Ron the White.
Justin: Ron the White, [Griffin: Yeah.] Tater Salad.
Clint: So you’re leaving Larry the Cable Guy for me?
Travis: You could do the guy with the signs.
Clint: Bill Engvall! No, I’ll be Engvall. I’ll be Bill Engvall.
Travis: Yeah, Engvall with his signs would probably some kind of divination class.
Justin: Divination—
Clint: [crosstalk] Here’s your omen. [Griffin laughing] Here’s your omen.
Griffin: Larry the Cable Guy could be like a tinker class [Travis: Yeah, uh.] Or perhaps like a thief or something that can work with traps. Like a trapper of some sort.
Justin: Or, here’s what I— Here’s what I—
Travis: [crosstalk] What about a bard named Larry the Fable Guy.
Griffin: Ooh, that’s quite great.
Justin: That’s very good.
Griffin: Well, okay. So.
Justin: Since we’re jumping through time and portals and stuff, maybe it could be Cable the Cable Guy.
Travis: Uuuhh. [Griffin: Oooh.] I like that!
Justin: From Marvel.
Griffin: Okay. Uh, Ned—
Clint: [crosstalk] Why are we not recording this? This is good stuff.
Griffin: Yeah, real—
Justin: Real good.
Griffin: Real quick: Ned, Aubrey and Duck killed the last big monster and the world is safe. Thanks for listening to TAZ: Amnesty. Now it’s time to move on to this great season of podcasting that we have just devised of the last three minutes.
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: I would kill for this—
Justin: Hey, let’s pick a name for it, so people can get on our nerves about it.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Yes, it’d be F— I mean, The Adventure Zone: Funny. Just to keep it sort of the convention. Uhm, no. We’re gonna do a Lunar Interlude for our current arc. Just to like— We haven’t done a The The Adventure Zone Zone about Amnesty since we’ve been in it, sort of, by my guess I think, we’re probably like halfway through it. I wanna say. This is gonna be a shorter one than TAZ: Balance. And uh… I also feel like it’s getting a lot more freeform than TAZ: Balance was towards the end. I think we all tried to make this beginning of Amnesty kind of more structured and uh… I don’t know, narrative heavy like the end of Balance was. And I think that the way the game has sort of moved, it’s been a lot more freeform. So when I say it’s like halfway through, I’ve no fucking idea. But it feels like we’re about there. And we’re gonna do like level up stuff and Heathcliff stuff.
Yeah, you wanted to do the Lunar Interlude this time like based on what kind of progression you wanted. Based on what thing you chose as your level up ability [Justin: Right.] Rather than me doing like “Hey, you’re going on a ski trip and then for no reason at all, you know, Duck eats some good soup and his sharp skill increases. Instead of doing that, like having some sort of narrative justification for it. So, that’s what we did this time—
Travis: It also— There are also have been scenes like that… I’ve wanted to— You know, a scene— Specifically one that we’re doing today. That I’ve wanted to do but it feels weird to stop in the middle of hunting a monster to be like “And now let’s do this!”
Griffin: Yeah, for sure.
Travis: This worked out well.
Griffin: Yeah, I’m really enjoying the game. I agree that the constant kind of tension of “There’s a monster on the loose that could kill somebody” does kind of lend itself to railroading a bit. Like Travis said, it’s tough to be like “Okay and then you go take a pottery class while, you know, the Bandersnatch gets the— eats up the kids”. I didn’t watch that Black Mirror episode but I think that’s what it’s about. So, who wants to start? I’ll leave it up to you guys. Who is the most randy for RPG.
Justin: Let Ned go ‘cause there’s somebody at my door.
Griffin: Okay, [Clint: Okay, great!] we’re gonna let Ned go first. Uhm, Ned.
Clint: Yes!
Griffin: You’ve told me what you want your progression thing to be and what the scene is going to be, so. Let’s hop right into it. Ned, you— This, by the way, takes place in like the couple of months between the December hunt and I guess next one will be the February hunt. So this is sometime in that stretch of time. We don’t have to all take place at the same time. But it’s in there. Ned, you find yourself at Whistles’ auto shop and trusted used car dealership. It is the automotive hotspot for all of Pocahontas County and you are standing there as a tow truck sort of loudly deposits the still mangled wreckage of your Lincoln Continental in the lot, where the shop’s proprietor, Whistles, eyes it over with concern.
Griffin: Ooh! That’s quite good
Travis: Now Griffin, I’m sorry. Is he whistling as he eyes it over or is his name Whistles?
Griffin: His name is Whistles and this is a name that Justin said off-handedly during some Duck lie and now he breathed life into this great character Whistles, the auto dealer.
Travis: Okay, and one additional question: On this auto dealership, has anyone ever been frozen in a block of ice as a publicity stunt?
Griffin: Uh, yes. Clint McElroy, [Clint gasps] who is sort of a plane-walker [Clint wheezes] between our worlds.
Clint: We have esta— That is canon, right? We’ve established I am able to move from plane to plane.
Travis: That is true, yes. ‘Cause he does appear also in Adventure Zone: Balance.
Clint: And I was frozen in a giant block of ice in a used car dealership once.
Griffin: That is true.
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s the reference I was making!
Clint: I know! I know!
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: So Whistles looks at like the mangled corpse of your Lincoln Continental and says,
Whistles: Well, Ned, ya really don’ it this time.
Ned: How old are you, Whistles? You sound like Gabby Hayes from the old western movies.
Whistles: That’s a pretty whack way to meet somebody, to say hi to ‘em.
[Travis laughing]
Whistles: But uh… I’m 51 years old.
Ned: Wow.
Whistles: Yeah, no. It’s a hard livin’.
[hysterical laughing]
Ned: Hard living here in Kepler!
Whistles: So uh, what the hell did ya do to his car, Ned? It looks like it got run over by a train.
Ned: Close! Close. It was the… tram thing, over the ski… hill. The—
Travis: Nailed it, got it in one.
Ned: The uh… I know the name of it. It’s the funiculi. Funiculi! Ran into my car. It’s— I’m sitting there, minding my own business, and this jumps out and attacks my car. But it’s salvageable, right?
Whistles: Oh, Ned, no. I mean, it’s a lil bit cost prohibitive to fix this. Ned, this thing’s beyond the point of no return. This car’s up in heaven now, Ned. This is Jesus’ car.
Ned: Oh…
Whistles: This is not somethin’ I can fix, or any human being can fix. So uh, sorry to tell ya, but no. There’s some good parts in there maybe. Maybe there’s some good parts in there. There’s, you know, still some demand for these antique car components. I might be able to find a trade for you somewhere in the lot.
Ned: There’s an 8-track player, a great 8-track player, I’d really love to hang on.
Whistles: I can get that one out for you. There’s still chance to sell it on a flea market or something like that.
Ned: And I’ve still got a bunch of shit in the trunk. So I need to get that out too, right?
Whistles: I mean, yes Ned. Why do you even need to ask me that? That’s weird.
Ned: Well, I didn’t know it was gonna be totalled. I really thought you’d be able to work that Whistle-magic and fix her right up.
Whistles: Uh, magic’s not real, Ned.
[Travis and Justin laughing]
Whistles:I’m a mechanic, I use tools and stuff. I’ll tell you though, I don’t wanna leave you hangin’ out to dry. I’ll do a trade for ya. Obviously it ain’t gonna be another classic Continental, but uh. We’ll find something on the lot worth at least the parts I’ll be able to strip out of this thing.
Clint: Okay, so. Just to kinda… This is how long after the last hunt?
Griffin: I don’t know, you tell me.
Clint: You said a couple of months, right?
Griffin: Somewhere in between like the late December hunt and the February, which will be the next arc.
Clint: Okay! Well, here’s the thing. Obviously, with the end of the last episode he’s kinda feels some guilt that he hasn’t been a more active team member.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: He has an idea of what he wants to get and he’s wandering around this lot, is Whistles doing that whole “used car salesman hanging all over, hovering—”
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh yeah. I think, yeah you and Whistles hop in a few different cars, like there’s an Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera that’s kinda beat up, there’s an old manual Yugo, there’s a—
Travis: Maybe an old, kind of rusty yellow VW Bug but it has a spark of life in it.
Griffin: Oooh.
Travis: It’s Bumblebee.
Griffin: An AllSpark of life. Yeah, there’s probably Lincoln Town Car, just like trying some stuff out.
Justin: Griffin, you really put Transformers in this thing? What’s up?
Griffin: Uhm. I mean.
Justin: Hey, I hear you guys talking about Transformers like, are you going to put Transformers in this motherfucker?
Griffin: Don’t spoil the surprise ending.
Travis: Oh, is that our next? We gotta hunt a Transformer?
Griffin: Well, the next one is gonna be the blue collar comedy tour, boys. And Transformers—
Clint: [crosstalk] And then hunt the Transformer.
Justin: Transformers Generation—
Travis: [crosstalk] Thus Adventure Zone: Gasoline.
[Clint laughing]
Clint: Okay, so Ned. All right. Ned spots something, [Travis gasps] there on the lot. And he remembers what Victoria was telling him about fate and luck and destiny. And it’s this humongous food truck. A gigantic food— the biggest food truck Ned has ever seen. And painted at the side of it, it says “Crêpes by Monica” [pronounced like “craps”, close to the French pronunciation]. There was a lady called Monica in Kepler, who is— who tried to make a go of it with the food truck business. Selling crêpes. But this is, you know, this is—
Griffin: Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. You call ‘em “craps”?
Justin: Did you just say “craps”, dad? How much—
Travis: Is it “craps”?
Clint: It’s crêpes [pronounced like “craps”].
Travis: Crêpes! [pronounced like “crayps”, the American pronunciation] It’s “crayps”!
Clint: [crosstalk] It’s not “crayps”—
Griffin: [crosstalk] It is for sure— It is for sure “crayps”!
Travis: [crosstalk] It is!
Clint: Do you say “crayp-paper”?
Travis: Yes!
Justin: You’re perfect, don’t—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Don’t change a thing.
Justin: —change nothing. They’re now “craps”.
Clint: Okay, so. So, this is obviously—
Travis: “Monica’s Creeps”.
Clint: A fried—
Justin: [singing] Doomsday crêpers!
Clint: A fried baloney sandwich market. Creeps— Crêpes [“Crayps”] are not gonna be very popular. So Ned looks at this and has this epiphany that with just a little bit of paint he could change “Crêpes by Monica” into “Cryptonomica”.
Griffin: Ooh! That’s quite good.
Travis: Oh, I see!
Justin: Okay, yeah!
Travis: Oh, I see!
Justin: Okay, yeah!
Clint: And it could be a rolling headquarters for whatever the hell the three of them are called. And with surveillance equipment inside, some weapons and he can roll around [Justin: Damn, I can tell you’re a writer.] like a mobile headquarters. But at the same time, you’re hiding right under their noses because it’s gonna look like a rolling billboard for Cryptonomica, but it’s really their mobile base.
Griffin: And are you gonna get of the “Crêpes by Monica” sort of paint job and write “Cryptonomica” [Clint: Yeah!] Or is it—
Clint: Yeah, it won’t take very much at all. Just a little bit of paint to change [Griffin: Okay.] “Crêpes by Monica” into “Cryptonomica”.
Griffin: Uh, I mean. Let’s resolve this. You’re talking about borrowing a move from the Professional playbook. The mobility—
Clint: [crosstalk] Yes, the mobility. Yup.
Griffin: Yeah. So, for that you have a truck, van or car built for monster hunting or crêpery. Choose two good things and one bad thing about it, and then there’s some tags: Roomy; surveillance gear; fast; stealthy; intimidating; classic; medical kit; sleeping space; toolkit; concealed weapons; anonymous; armoured; tough; monster cage. So two of those.
Clint: I’m gonna go with surveillance gear and concealed weapons. Like night vision, stuff like that.
Travis: Flashlights.
Clint: Flashlights.
Griffin: I’m into that. Like radio scan— Like you guys don’t have a lot of ways to [Clint: A police scanner.] scan the town. Yeah. I think that’s a very logical choice. And then for concealed weapons is it like stuff inside like Men in Black style, you like press on a panel and some guns come out? Or is it on the outside?
Clint: I don’t know how we would justify that.
Griffin: The outside one, I think, would be much harder— Like if a chaingun comes out of the top. In the shape of a crêpe, like that is way harder to justify than you have secret, hidden weapons inside the panels of the truck.
Travis: But I think you could say in a food truck, there are probably lots of cabinets and stuff. [Griffin: Oh for sure!] Like where you could definitely store weapons. So that if we were ever like stopped by cops or whatever—
Griffin: [crosstalk] And had to fight them!?
Travis: No! [Griffin: Oh, yes.] But they wouldn’t be like [Justin: Woah, twist!] why are you travelling with like eight shotguns.
Griffin: All right. Is that what you want? [Clint sighs] If you want a different tag—
Clint: You know what, I’ll tell you what. It might make more sense for it to be something like a tool thing. You know, I don’t want Ned all of the sudden to become the Terminator and have all this firepower.
Travis: Well now, hold on. What if he does, though?
Griffin: [laughing] Yeah, toolkit is one of the things. So, that can be the tag if you want.
Clint: I don’t know.
Travis: No, that does fit! Because like that was pretty well established with Ned that the trunk was full of stuff that he needed.
Griffin: Oh yeah. Yeah, that’s it! This is your bag of holding [Clint: There you go.], right?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah, the toolkit— the toolkit is a way to finally sort of have a mechanical like justification for the fact that Ned can have whatever the fuck he wants whenever he wants it.
Clint: All right.
Griffin: Okay, so toolkit and surveillance gear and then bad things: loud; obvious; temperamental; beaten-up; gas-guzzler; uncomfortable; slow or old. You have to pick one of those.
Clint: I think “obvious” because it got “Cryptonomica” written at the side of it.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. Okay, that’s great. Write that down somewhere if you do not mind.
Clint: I just did! [laughing] [smug] ‘Cause I know how to play this game.
Griffin: Okay, so you’re in the driver seat there with Whistles and— his name is plural, right? Yes, okay. And he says,
Whistles: All right, well this one’s a interesting choice, Ned. Gotta warn you, brakes don’t work super good, you’re gonna need to start pressin’ that pedal pretty far in advance to where you actually wanna stop. No—
Ned: Good to know.
Whistles: No AC, so if you wanna get this thing, you know, sellin’ enchiladas or whatever have you, it’s gonna get a little hot back in the kitchen.
Ned: Well, we only have— We only have, you know, adventures in like the fall and the winter. So I don’t think it’ll be that big of a problem.
Whistles: It’s good to hear about your enchilada adventures. [Travis and Justin laughing] Excited for that to come up. So I’m gonna head inside and start drawing up the paperwork. You go ahead and get familiar with your new ride.
Ned: Thank you. Thank you so much.
Griffin: And he hops out of the car and you are sort of poking around the front panel—
Travis: Enjoy your whip!
Griffin: “Crêpes by Monica”. And you know, looking around in the compartment up in the sunvisor, see if there’s any, you know, if anybody left any money in here, I guess. And the passenger door opens and someone hops quickly into the front seat.
Ned: Look, I said I’d take it. Quit with the high-pressure stuff.
Griffin: And uh, he says,
Boyd: Doin’ a bit of ca’ shopping—
Griffin: I don’t— I don’t want to do a British accent anymore. This is the second time I’ve bailed from doing a British accent on this show. Hm. He says, because he was in prison and his voice changed while he was in prison.
Clint: Yeah, that happens.
Griffin: It happens.
Boyd: [rough] Hey there, Ned. It’s been a bit, hasn’t it?
Griffin: And it’s Boyd Mosche.
Ned: Mosche… Oh… I’ve wondered when—
Griffin: I don’t think— Have you? You’ve described Boyd before, right? Like he’s big, he’s like built. He’s like a strong dude. Is like— Have you like… laid out any other sort of visual—
Travis: Looks badass, I believe is what was said.
Griffin: He looks badass is yeah, so I guess he is like a fucking— he's wearing a Punisher t-shirt. Although I don't know what that means.
Clint: I don’t— I think he’s uh… I think he’s a good looking guy. I mean, I think he’s, you know, can be very persuasive. Nice looking fella.
Griffin: Sure.
Clint: I think everything about Boyd Mosche is colored in Ned’s mind because he, you know, he sees Boyd as being the root of all of his problems.
Travis: I’ve always pictured him as kind of like Jason Statham.
Griffin: Huh, okay. Uh… Well then I have to make him British again.
Clint: Then you gotta go back to the British accent.
Travis: You can do it, Griffin.
Justin: Why does Travis get to pick what dad’s imaginary friend looks like?
[Clint laughing]
Travis: ‘Cause I’m dad’s imaginary friend.
Griffin: He says,
Boyd: [British accent] Hello there, Ned. It's been a bit, hasn't it?
Ned: Oh… Mosche… Wondered when you were gonna pop up. Where's my stuff?
Griffin: He’s also kinda looking around the car like you were, uh, just moments ago before he hopped in. And he says—
Boyd: Well that's, uh, that's quite a way to greet an old friend there, Ned. You’ll—
Ned: If you were an old friend, I’d greet you as an old friend, but actually you're a dick who ruined my life, so let's get on with the conversation, okay?
Griffin: He looks at you, and he's kinda like agog for a second, and then he starts laughing and he's like,
Boyd: Uh, I’m sorry I got things confused. Last time we spoke, we were in a car, bit smaller than this one, and it was wrapped around a tree— I’m fine by the way— and then you left me for dead, as you ran off into the woods with our loot. So, you're saying that I ruined your life. That's one way to sort of frame this situation.
Ned: We wouldn't have been there in the first place if it hadn't been for you. We wouldn't have been on the road, driving like crazy people, if it hadn't been for what you did at the house. And you were the one behind the wheel! So don't blame me for your shitty driving.
Griffin: He sighs, and he just starts looking around the car and he says,
Boyd: Wait a minute, are you trading in your Continental?
[Ned sighs]
Boyd:I've got to say, I'm surprised. This one doesn't seem to have that Ned Chicane flair that I've come to expect from you.
Ned: Remember the car you wrecked before? Now imagine the Continental wrecked in the exact same way. So you're not the only one having bad vehicular issues.
Griffin: [chuckles] He laughs and he says,
Ned: [crosstalk] Yeah, I was gonna say, did that happen before or after you stole all my stuff?
Boyd: Well, some of that, I think to be fair, and I think you would admit this as well, was also mine. But I wouldn’t consider that a crime. Listen, I’ll give you your things back, I promise. I don’t need— I have no need for your trophies. I just need something from you first.
Ned: Okay. What?
Griffin: He’s got a little messenger bag he starts rooting around in as he talks. And he says,
Boyd: Well, I’ve got no prospects in this country, Ned. I wanna go home. But I need a little nest egg to help me get started before I go and you’re just the man to get it for me. I would do it myself but I’m on parole, Ned, I have to be a good boy.
Ned: Hm. Of course.
Griffin: He says,
Boyd: I know you’re not much for art, Ned, but have you ever heard of a sculptor named Madelyn Cobb?
Ned: Uhm… Madelyn Cobb, Madelyn Cobb… No… Not familiar.
Boyd: Oh, she’s brilliant. She’s very reclusive and her works are worth quite a bit of money. Particularly this one, it’s called Shade Tree.
Griffin: And he hands you a small printout of this wooden sculpture. Looks like it’s about two feet tall and it’s intricately carved out of this bright, lustrous wood. It depicts this rhododendron tree, carved in breathtaking detail and beneath it is a figure sort of lying and looking upward into the trees branches. It is a lovely sculpture. Boyd says,
Boyd: Shade Tree is valued at a high six figures. I’ve got a fence lined up who will get me just that if I can bring it to him. Which will be enough to get me a new life back across the pond. You steal Shade Tree for me and I’m out of your hair for good.
Ned: Look, I’ve gone straight, too. I— I— uh, I’m a very reputable dealer of antiquities, uh, I run my own high quality museum. I am beloved in the community.
Justin: If you— If you listen closely you can hear dad’s buttcheeks flex as he attempts violently not to imitate Griffin’s accent. [Travis and Griffin laughing] He keeps wanting to veer wildly into it, but he’s gripping on for dear life.
Clint: It’s tough, it’s really tough.
Justin: [laughing] It’s difficult—
Clint: Blimey, it’s hard.
Justin: Pr— pr— Cor blimey, I’m very proud of you.
[Travis and Griffin laughing]
Griffin: He says—
Clint: Squire!
Griffin: He says,
Boyd: Well, I appreciate that you’ve managed to turn your life around while I did our sentence in the clink, Ned, but I’m only asking you for one job. And frankly it’s a cakewalk. You don’t even have to go that far, Ned, I’ve done a bit of scouting since I’ve been in town and I found where Madelyn lives. Get this,
[music begins]
Boyd: She runs an inn right here in Kepler.
Griffin: And he hands you a small stack of photographs taken surreptitiously from behind some branches of the woods. And they’re photographs of Amnesty Lodge.
[music fades out]
Griffin: So, Travis, you wanted to do a scene with Janelle, where you sort of are talking to her about the—
Travis: Yes, my magical guide, Janelle Monáe.
Griffin: Yeah, I’m okay with that headcanon. [Travis: Yep.] And you sort of talk about the nature of your magic stuff, which has, I think, developed over the last arc or so.
Travis: Yeah, I've really gotten good at this whole magic thing!
Griffin: Sometimes. Sometimes you drop a [crosstalk] Pizza Hut sign on all your friends.
Travis: [crosstalk] I can do it all!
Griffin: Uh, that is true. So, I think your training with Janelle— I like the idea of you all sparring. I think your training sessions have gotten a lot less, you know, you… levitating rocks on Dagobah, and more like, you know, full blown wizard duels as you sort of work on your magic together. And, so you're in this large banquet hall in the castle in Sylvain. It gives you a lot more space to spar. And Janelle pulls up a pant leg and stomps on the ground and this huge chunk of stone cracks out of the floor and starts flying at you. What do you do?
Travis: Uh, dive out of the way, and it's magically inspired, like a wind blows the stone one way as it blows me the other.
Griffin: Okay, I like that. How do you retaliate?
Travis: I would say… big fireball sent towards her head.
Griffin: Classic. Roll… I see you in roll20 here, why don't you roll plus weird. And if you really hard fail this one, this may be the end of Janelle, which would be a tragedy.
Travis: It was 8. Well, plus weird that's a 10. '''
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, out of 10 you, uh, throw a fireball at her and she tries to do like, the same maneuver you just did. She tries to raise up this wall of water to actually just, like, sizzle out the fireball effortlessly but it actually, like, the force of your fireball knocks her backwards. And she falls to the ground, and she looks at you. And she looks very impressed, and your duel comes to an—
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, out of 10 you, uh, throw a fireball at her and she tries to do like, the same maneuver you just did. She tries to raise up this wall of water to actually just, like, sizzle out the fireball effortlessly but it actually, like, the force of your fireball knocks her backwards. And she falls to the ground, and she looks at you. And she looks very impressed, and your duel comes to an—
Aubrey: Oh shit, are you okay?
Griffin: She laughs and she says,
Janelle: You will need to try a little bit harder if you wanted to really hurt me, Aubrey, but yes, I’m more than okay. I am proud. You have come so far since we first met. It is fascinating to me, both from, you know, an arcane studies perspective and now as also, you know, a friend. I’m excited for you, Aubrey.
Aubrey: And we are friends, aren't we, Janelle? I do— That's nice to hear. And friends, friends talk about things, don't they? They share things, they don't judge each other.
Janelle: Is this like a relationship thing, because I would not be
Aubrey: No.
Janelle:---great at— Okay.
Aubrey: I’m fine with that. Um, I need— [hums nervously] I need to talk to you, and— Hmm. You're gonna be mad.
Janelle: Okay.
Griffin: She pulls up a chair. She casts a spell and, like, fixes the table and the banquet hall, which almost certainly got exploded during your duel, and pulls up one of the chairs as it sort of reforms beneath her, and she sits down and says,
Janelle: I’m listening.
Aubrey:Okay, if I tell you this, I need you to promise that you're not gonna, like… Don't react—
Janelle:Aubrey, this is not a great way to tell somebody something. What happened?
Aubrey:I know that, but I don't want you to like get really mad and yell or anything.
Janelle: You have my word.
Aubrey:Hmm. How about I step backwards into this and ask this question. Has anyone from my side of the gate ever touched that crystal out there? Hypothetically.
Janelle:Uh, that is hard to say, Aubrey. Obviously we were under centuries of assault from—
Travis: And Aubrey takes off her sunglasses.
Griffin: I don't think she knows what that means. I get the gesture here, but I definitely— I don't think she's seen like the multicolored eyes. And she's just like talking and not paying attention. She's like,
Janelle: Uh, the crystal was shattered and Sylvain left us, in some capacity [crosstalk] when the crystal was shattered.
Travis: [crosstalk] And Aubrey just kinda starts pointing to her orange eyeball.
Griffin: And she looks up at you and says,
Janelle: Oh, goodness, Aubrey.
Aubrey: Yeah. So, I touched it… That's one, I guess, that's bullet point one.
Griffin: She doesn't look, like, angry or disappointed. She looks like she's— like instantly, like her instant reflexive reaction is like, it looks like she's trying to solve a math problem in her head, like she is trying to work something out, as you fess up.
Aubrey: And when I touched it, did you— I don't know if you noticed the little kind of impromptu garden that sprung up around the crystal. Did you maybe notice that in the last, like, month?
Griffin: She stops her, like, calculation and looks up at you and just wordlessly nods.
Aubrey: So like, bullet point two, I touched it. I felt like I was dying, like it was Flowbee-ing all of the power out of me. “Oh, I pull hand off. Woah!” And then there's flowers, orange eyeball, and I— Yeah, so is that what you all feel when you touch the crystal?
Griffin: She has like long since gone back to her calculation, and then she like suddenly stands up with a start and she like looks around the room to make sure that it's just the two of you in there, and she says,
Janelle: You need to come with me right now, Aubrey.
Aubrey: Aww, am I in trouble?
Griffin: She is already like walking away, towards the door.
Aubrey: Okay!
Griffin: And she leads you out of the banquet hall, and down this long hallway, past a couple detachments of guards. And she takes you into this large chamber that, looking at the opposite wall from the one you entered from, you can tell is actually behind the royal hall from where you first met the ministers of this world during your first trip to this place. You see the three columns that they climb up on to hold court. And in the center of this room, there is, you know, there's marble floor. Right in the center of it is a crest depicting this large, orange crystal in front of the castle. And as you and Janelle step on it, she waves her hand and this circular crest lights up and then starts descending into the ground, and then you're just riding this platform downward. And very quickly, you enter into this massive, massive chamber. It honestly looks like where Heathcliff lives, like you cannot even perceive the true scope of this chamber, it is so massive.
[music fades in]
Janelle: So… This is Sylvain. This is what it really looks like.
Aubrey: Uh-huh.
Janelle: As far as I know you're the first human to ever see this.
Aubrey: Well, thank you? So am I in trouble? Like let's get back to this in trouble thing.
Janelle: It’s hard to say, Aubrey. You're not in trouble with me, but you are very much in danger.
Aubrey: Well that's not better!
Janelle: I’m not gonna sugarcoat it, Aubrey. There are things you need to understand before you can understand the shape of that danger. This is Sylvain, this is the heart of her. This is the thing that sustains all life on this planet. It is the source of all magic that we know of. It was the source of those things I should say. Sylvain, the entity inside of it; the entity that sustained this world is gone now. And as a result, this planet cannot sustain us. The corruption beyond our city's walls, the same corruption that inhabits your Pine Guard chronicler, it is a reaction to Sylvain's disappearance. We call it the quell. It is not a malevolent force, Aubrey. It is doing what it thinks it needs to do to salvage the planet. It is killing us before we can kill it.
Aubrey: Where did Sylvain go?
Janelle: Nobody's quite sure. She disappeared when we were attacked some centuries ago by humans from your world who found a portal and crossed over and shattered the crystal on the surface. They took shards of it home as souvenirs, Aubrey. I am still quite sore about it. But. Some people think that Sylvain is dead. Some people think that she is just weakened because of the damage done to her heart. Nobody is quite sure, Aubrey. But as a result the planet is weakened. And yet you're telling me that it seemed to respond to your human touch.
Aubrey: Yes. I would say respond might be downplaying it since I almost died from being I dunno attached to it or whatever. It felt like dying. That's hard to say 'cause that's like saying you know I had a panic attack and I almost died. It felt like it, but I have no i— yes. Okay, so yes I touched it, it responded. Short answer: Yes.
Janelle: And you breathed life into the ground beneath your feet. Okay. Our world has not long to live, Aubrey. A year maybe more before the—
Aubrey: Aw dip!
Janelle: Yeah. Before the quell overwhelms us, before Sylvain's light fades for good. And there are those among us who would absolutely destroy your world if it meant saving our own. There are those among your people who would try to destroy our world if they recognized that threat. Don’t you see, Aubrey? The tether that connects our worlds… it is built to lead to the death and destruction of both of our people if things escalate beyond our control. If people here, in Sylvain, Aubrey, find out that humans who touch the crystal will have their life drained from them to bring our planet back to life? That is not a secret that I would prefer to get out there, Aubrey. You can’t say anything like that out-loud here ever again. Do you understand me?
Aubrey: Uh— Yes. But also, maybe we can work out like an exchange. Where like the humans, we come over, we touch it for three or five seconds and your people touch it for five seconds. And we find a balance. Like a blood bank! You know? We come, we donate. Then you all could take what you need.
Janelle: You know your people better than I do, but does that sound realistically like something they would agree to? En masse?
Aubrey: Nnnno. No. On - en masse? No.
Janelle: Aubrey, I will teach you what I can about your powers. What I understand of them. But your meddling in our world’s affairs [music fades in] may very well be the catalyst for all out war between our realms.
Aubrey: Ahh.
Janelle: You are a brave woman, Aubrey, I’ve become very fond of you these past months. But this is not your world to save.
{Ad break: 38:35 - 43:09}
Griffin: Duck—
Travis: Uh, I should say. I took +1 weird.
Griffin: Uh, yeah—
Travis: I should mention, that’s my—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yes that is a good way of finishing that.
Travis: I got strong, I got better at magic through training. +1 weird.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. All right, Duck.
Justin: Yep.
Griffin: You messaged me like 45 minutes ago, or 45 minutes before we started recording.
Justin: There’s no need to make this seem like a spur-of-the-moment decision.
Griffin: You said “I can’t wait to level up my wizard” and I had to be like “Aw, dog.”
Travis: Oh no!
Griffin: Oh no!
Justin: No.
Griffin: You wanted to do a scene with Leo, which of course is kind of the scene we have to do. ‘Cause it’ll be wild if he was like “By the way I’ve got powers, too” and then you’re like mini-golfing with your friend Jeff.
Justin: I do, though, it feels weird for it to be the same timelapse as like you talked about with dad.
Griffin: No, no, it can be that night. Like if—
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay, yeah.
Griffin: I’m saying anywhere in that two months.
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay, that’s the scene that you need to see.
Griffin: Yeah. Where is it happening?
Justin: [crosstalk] So that’s the scene I wanna do.
Griffin: Yeah, he’s standing at your doorstep when he had the sword and you realised that Minerva was apparently speaking to him. And uh… Where do you wanna do this scene? Are we picking up literally right then? Or are you in one of your places?
Justin: Uh, we cut to… inside the apartment.
Griffin: Yours or his? ‘Cause you’re neighbours.
Justin: My apartment.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And I’m lying on the floor of the bathroom.
Griffin: [laughing] Okay.
Justin: Just like… yes. All right, and that is where the scene is happening.
Griffin: And he’s sitting on the toilet, I guess? On top of the lid?
Justin: No, he’s standing in the doorway.
Griffin: Okay [Justin: All right.], he’s standing in the doorway to the bathroom. Not sitting on the toilet. [Justin: No.] Thank you, Justin, that would have been a weird sort of feeling. [Travis laughing] For this scene.
Justin: Yeah, it woulda been a weird sort of feel.
Griffin: He says,
Leo: Do you got any like Pepto-Bismol or something? Do you need like a ginger ale?
Duck: No, just… All right. All right. I know, you’ve done it three times. Just one more time for me, ‘cause I’m gonna get it this time. Start at the beginning.
Leo: Okay, Duck. Uh… I was also chosen there for a bit, until you were chosen. Before the gate opened up in the woods, here in Kepler, there was one up in Manhattan, old 91st street station’s been shut down for like half a century or something. Gate opened there, monster started to come out, Minerva showed up in my dreams, like I’m sure she did for you. Popped up in that weird spectral form. [Duck mumbling] I thought she was like a Slimer or something.
Duck: Yeah.
Leo: Did you— was that your first inclina— I never had anybody to talk to about this, but I thought it was a Slimer.
Duck: I thought I was high. Because I was in high school and I had… Yeah. I thought I was high.
Leo: Well, anyway, she taught me the ropes, she gave me the powers and I protected New York City from otherworldly threats there for like 19 years or something. And you know, got older. My body stopped being quite as sprightly. Then my gate disappeared. Next thing I know, Minerva told me that she’s chosen someone new and my shift was over. So I had to get to Kepler where the gate was now and deliver the new chosen one a blade. Keeping, you know, keep watch over him as he learns the craft. So that’s what I’ve been doing.
Duck: So why didn’t you… do that.
Leo: What do you mean?
Duck: I mean, I’ve been figuring this stuff out by myself. Like if you were supposed to come here and watch over me and help me and be all… you know, Mr. Miyagi and shit. Where have you been?
Leo: I just had to watch ya, Duck. And make sure that nothin’, you know, seriously bad happened to you. Minerva was explicitly clear that I wasn’t supposed to spill the beans. I think she— Frankly, Duck? I don’t think she wanted you to know there were other chosen people out there. I can understand her concern. You know, not feelin’ special and what-have-you and also understanding that this job, it doesn’t just end. It ends when you end, most of the time. It’s complicated, Duck, but she had a plan. And I was there every step of the way, making sure you never got snuffed out.
Duck: Can you… Has there been any specific times you could point to, where my bacon was preserved by you? Or is it just been kind of an overall guiding lights sort of deal.
Leo: Sorta like, yeah, a guiding light. I’m not a helicopter parent or anything like that. Yeah, you’ve been doing great. So anyway… Yeah. I didn’t think we would ever get to have this conversation until a few minutes ago, when she… I guesses… I guess she’s just gone now, Duck.
Duck: Ye-
Leo: I understand that this is quite a shock to you but I need you to understand this was my friend for 30 some-odd years or something. So I’m also kinda trying to process some stuff right now.
Griffin: And I think now he does go sit down on the toilet. Fuck you guys. And he’s buckling u— he’s sitting on the john.
Duck: Uhm, so do you have like powers, too?
Leo: Uh, I mean. Not as strong as it used to be. I haven’t been doin’ much monster huntin’ these days. Let me see.
Griffin: And he tries to rip the toilet up out of the ground. And he’s like,
Leo: Wait a minute, I shouldn’t be doin’ this in the first place. I don’t know, Duck. I think I’ve still got powers but honestly, since Minerva disappeared…
Justin: I pick up a roll of toilet paper and I chuck it at his head.
Griffin: It hits him. Like it just absolutely hits him in the head.
Duck: Yeah. Yeah, man. Hey… yeah. Me too.
Leo: Wait uh… Hold on. You tellin’ me that… your powers are—
Duck: Punch me in the stomach.
Griffin: He stands you up and he’s like,
Leo: Are you sure there, Duck?
Duck: Punch me in the stomach, c'mon!
Griffin: Do you want me to roll for this? Or just— then I just gonna get ‘cha. I think if you want the punch he’s gonna punch ya.
Justin: Yeah, just punch me. You don’t need to roll for it.
Griffin: He is, you know, the humble, friendly, local grocer who’s… I forget what age range I put him in, but he’s up there. And you don’t expect a lot but he punches you with surprising force right in the gut.
Justin: I vomit into the tub.
Duck: See?
[Travis laughing]
Clint: You see?
Duck: Do you see? It’s gone, man. That’s the game.
Leo: Can we go in the kitchen and finish this conversation or somethin’? It’s yucky in here.
Duck: [laughing] Yeah. That’s fine—
Griffin: Jumpcut to the kitchen.
Duck: That’s fine, I could use some granola or something.
Griffin: He says,
Leo: All right, listen up, panic er nothin’. I mean this makes sense. All the powers that we had, technically we were just borrowin’ from Minerva after all. Her people, I don’t know how much she told her people, they got some sort of psychic thing where they can share their combat prowess with whomever they choose as long as they get a line of communication open with ‘em. And uh… I guess it’s gone now. For you and me, Duck. That line of communication, and this next part is gonna sound a lot scarier than it actually is, so you know batten down the hatches. Minerva was talking to us through a wormhole, Duck, that we… A little, barely there even little wormhole that was sorta inside our brains?
Duck: Mhm.
Leo: I guess now that she’s gone, the phoneline’s been disconnected, please try later, you know.
Duck: Uh… Llllleo, I mean this is a lot to take in. I mean, holistically speaking, a lot. I mean— Finding out that you were chosen… I mean overall it makes you feel less special, honestly.
Leo: [crosstalk] You see, that’s exactly why, yeah.
Duck: If a bunch of people are being chosen it’s like… it’s less chosen and more like, I don’t know, pressured into it. [snorts]
Leo: Well this— this thing, Duck, this tether between our world and the other one,
Duck: Yeah.
Leo: the one that the monsters keep comin’ through. That ain’t somethin’ new. That’s been happening on earth for, I dunno man, centuries, millenia? It’s been here a while and there been people protectin’ it for quite some time. You know that Minerva’s planet had the same deal, right? Same sorta connection with another planet.
Duck: Yeah.
Leo: And they killed each other off.
Duck: Yeah.
Leo: Minerva was the only survivor. She told you that bit?
Duck: Yeah. Yeah, she told me the part where she was the one who did the killing, too.
Leo: Yeah, she did. And I think that she found us because she wanted to redeem herself in some way. To make sure that some other planet havin’ the same sort of situation didn’t settle things the same way. I think she was trying to make things right. And now I guess it’s just up to us now, Duck. I guess it’s just on you and me. I got a couple decades on you, so when I’m gone it’s just gonna be you. You’re gonna be the last one to ever be chosen. And no pressure buddy, but if you can’t find a way to stop those monsters from terrorizing our planet, ain’t nobody gonna stop it.
Duck: Yeah, well. Let’s— Here are some of the skills that I’m bringing to the table currently: Made of flesh, very vulnerable to bullets and knives and fangs and acid and poison. So those are pretty much my only weaknesses. I don’t know if I mentioned fire and blunt trauma and drowning… and bullets. But those are my weaknesses. Strengths include: Uh… large reservoir of botanical information [Clint snorts], pretty good at Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 [Griffin laughing], less good at 3, I dropped off at 3
[Clint laughing]. That is… it. I— I played the trombone for two years. I don’t know if that’s even gonna be… helpful or not. But that’s what I got, Leo. I mean that’s what I’m bringing to the table, currently.
Griffin: He says,
Leo: Well, I mean I know that ya… ya superhuman reflexes, some of ya powers are gone, Duck. But I wouldn’t say that ‘cha completely powerless.
Griffin: And he really quickly reaches over and he grabs Beacon, who kinda responds to his touch and uncoils. And he throws Beacon over towards you. I think Act Under Pressure? With your new stats, which we’ll talk about here in a second.
Justin: Hm… Okay.
Griffin: I can roll it for you if you don’t have—
Justin: Yeah, if you don’t mind. I wasn’t logged into the…
Griffin: Oh, that’s a ten!
Justin: Hey, great.
Griffin: Plus uh… what’s your cool?
Justin: One. [Laughing]
Griffin: Okay, so it’s 11. Yeah, you catch it. Like you catch the sword. I— I like the idea of Leo just coming at you with his broadsword. Just to like kinda shock you into heroism. He starts running in your direction with the broadsword sort of plunging towards you. What do you do?
Justin: Uh… I [wheezing] I throw Beacon back at him, still coiled, and go into a fetal position.
Griffin: [Laughing] Okay, you grab Beacon and it immediately coils up in your hand and you drop to the floor and Leo stabs through the rear wall of your apartment. It just goes— his broadsword cuts through the like uh…
Travis: Plaster?
Justin: The— [laughing]
Griffin: He like, it like stops—
Travis: [crosstalk] Drywall?
Griffin: Yeah, it stabs through the drywall and you can actually see it through the kitchen window now, [music fades in] just like peeking out of the side of your house. And he looks down at you and he says,
Leo: Okay, we're fucked.
Griffin: Why don’t we talk real quick, Justin, because yours is probably the most drastic thing we’ve ever done mechanics wise. In the game. [music fades out] ‘Cause you messaged me and had an idea for like a power you wanted to take and then I suggested something a little more dramatic.
Justin: Yeah, so I am no longer the Chosen. I am now Duck the Mundane.
Griffin: Yes, new playbook: the Mundane. And the powers here are so, so, so— Can you like read out some of the moves? That give it some of that good Mundane flavor? Good powerless—
Justin: [crosstalk] I’ll give— I’ll give you the ones that I have chosen. ‘Cause these are the ones that are—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay, yeah, you get to pick three.
Justin: And I’ve added one because I went ahead and took my upgrade levels. ‘Cause I didn’t feel like—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, go ahead and take like three levels up. Yeah.
Justin: Yeah. So I have “Always The Victim.” When another hunter uses protect someone to protect you, they mark experience. Whenever a monster captures me, I mark experience.
Griffin: It’s so good. It’s like a way of rewarding you for playing the powerless best friend archetype.
Justin: “Power Of Heart.” When fighting a monster, if I help someone, YOU don’t roll plus cool. You automatically help as though you rolled a 10.
Griffin: That is an incredibly powerful thing.
Justin: “Trust Me.” When you tell a normal person the truth in order to protect them from danger, roll plus charm. On a 10+ they'll do what you say they should, no questions asked. On a 7-9 they do it, but the Keeper chooses: They ask you a hard question first, stall and dither a while or have a “better” idea. Quote “better idea”. And on a—
Griffin: On a miss I get to screw you over, obviously.
Justin: Yeah. The last one I’ve chosen is “Don't Worry, I'll Check It Out.” Whenever you go off by yourself to check out somewhere scary, mark experience.
[Griffin and Travis laughing]
Griffin: So this class is all about putting yourself in danger and having to be rescued. I also really like that Power Of Heart move, because you are now, you know, the most human one of the group. And so you’re able to talk to people. And, you know, commiserate.
Justin: [crosstalk] My stats are worse.
Griffin: Yes, of course.
Justin: [crosstalk] Obviously. I have readjusted Beacon’s stats. The Mundane can get a golf club, baseball bat, cricket bat, or hockey stick. So I readjusted Beacon’s stats to be in line with those.
Griffin: I don’t— I don’t hate you still having the same— Like I don’t think Beacon would get weaker with you. I don’t actually like that.
Justin: Well, Beacon is also been damaged. [Griffin: Oh, that’s right!] So I figured that the two of us are— are— you know. We’re both damaged goods at this point.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Shiiit. Yeah. Okay.
Justin: So, he’s 2-harm— 2-harm, innocuous and messy. Are the current tags on that. And also the one upgrade is that I have a means of transport.
Griffin: Yes, now how do we?
Justin: So I can no longer run everywhere without getting tired. [Griffin laughing] Upon realising this, Duck dug back into his closet and dug out his skateboard.
Travis: YES! Yes, please!
Griffin: Yes. So you’ve got a busted sword, you’ve got a skateboard and you still do have a jetpack. So that can be a fun—
Justin: I— I’m pretty sure it… bro—
Griffin: It came back to you! It came back to you at the end of the last arc.
Justin: Okay.
Clint: Remember? It saved Ned.
Justin: Yeah, that’s true.
Griffin: It came back and— came back and saved Ned’s life. Okay, that’s fantastic. I’m very excited to—
Justin: So anyway, I’m just a regular person now. It’s not like a secret—
Travis: With a skateboard!
Justin: With a skateboard.
Clint: And a jetpack!
Justin: Yeah, I— yeah… Here’s a spoiler alert for you guys like: I no longer have the ability to shrug off all damage. If I’m gonna use a jetpack, I’m gonna be in the next state. I’m gonna have to like [Griffin laughing] activate that shit via wifi. No way!
Griffin: Uh, that’s great. Okay, so, the last thing we need to do is the Heathcliff stuff, where you all managed to get all three of the items on his list!
Travis: Which were, remind us again?
Griffin: A Seer’s Spectacles, a Lawkeeper Badge (or something like that), and the Victorious Seed which you got from defeating the big tree at the end of the last arc. So, you got all three! Well done! Y’all are— the three of you are now together in the chasm beneath Sylvain. You are in the Realm of the Enchanter. Uh, and that is still the most D&D ass- that’s more D&D ass shit than I did when we were playing D&D! You’re in the Enchanted Realm of the Enchanter, Heathcliff the big cat, and—
Clint: And there’s enchantment in the air!
Griffin: There is! You can feel it! And—
Travis: And everyone’s chanting!
Griffin: And there’s Heathcliff suddenly. Jumpcut! Heathcliff is there! We’re starting in media res. You’ve been there, and now there’s Heathcliff.
[Heathcliff’s theme song starts]
Griffin: And he says,
Heathcliff: I can sense the presence of a few valuables! A few precious items that I requested! Um… Yum yum gimme some!
Griffin: And he extends his huge paw down to the platform where you are standing in front of him.
Travis: I put the items on his very large toe beans—
Griffin: Awww!
Travis: Yeah…
Griffin: And he retrieves them and he says— he actually just like outstretches his toe beans and lets them fall down into the chasm below to land in… I don’t know, some sort of mysterious pot? Who knows what he’s got goin’ on in there!
Travis: Who could even say?
Clint: It’s a big Scrooge McDuck swimming pool full of artifacts.
Griffin: That’s probably what it is. And Heathcliff says,
Heathcliff: Okay, a deal’s a deal! What’s it gonna be? An enchantment? Summoning a new item? You all, uh— you all know the score. You might not; it’s been like nine months since we’ve spoken.
Travis: Yeah! I definitely remember, but maybe the folks at home don’t, Griffin.
Justin: Yeah! Let’s recap for their benefit.
Clint: Because we know! We remember.
Justin: For sure…
Griffin: Absolutely. This is a mechanic that I sort of hacked into the game to keep some of that D&D-magic-item feel going, called Acquisition, where you roll 2d6 plus the number of items you recovered for Heathcliff and you can either enchant an item you have now and try to get another tag added to it or summon a new item altogether. So, for example, in the last time you guys did this Aubrey enchanted her vest to get 1-armor, the 1-armor tag added to it and rolled successfully, so that was successfully added to the armor. Duck summoned a jetpack. That’s how he used his roll, so really really really open-ended system. It is fully up to you guys. I will now drop— oh— I will drop the gear tags into Slack. There’s the list of tags; it is quite long. Some of them are good, some of them are bad. Okay, Aubrey you rolled a…?
Travis: 20! Well, no… Basically, nat-20.
Griffin: You rolled a— holy shit you did roll 6-6. You rolled a nat-12 plus 3 so a 15!
Travis: I got a 15! I want… I’m looking for what would justify this… I want a knife that I can control.
Griffin: You want a magic fuckin’ The Phantom Knife?
Travis: Yes. The Shadow. Sorry Griffin.
Griffin: Was it The Shadow? Damn it, you’re right. Hmm…
Travis: Or maybe a throwing knife? I want— I want some kind of weapon [Griffin: Yeah?] that I can use. ‘Cause right now I’ve got the magic, and that’s great. Magic, don’t get me wrong, super great.
Justin: We need to make sure dad hasn’t been kicked off the call because Travis mentioned The Shadow and Dad didn’t smash into the conversation Kool-Aid Man style.
Clint: Who knows what evil? Who lurks?
Travis: See there it is, alright it must have cut out.
Justin: [crosstalk] There was like a five-minute delay, apparently, on the call.
Griffin: Yeah, Trav, I think we can— I mean, we can do whatever the fuck. I’m just trying to figure out a way to make it work. Uh, you get a… Oh, that’s right, you’ll get a positive and a negative tag for it. So I think the idea of you having a knife that you are, like, bonded with… I don’t necessarily know that this is like your “magic” magic. I think the knife is magic, but all of your magic so far has been very elemental. So unless you’re using the wind to blow this knife around—
Travis: No, no, no. I want it to be like a magic Sylvain knife. You know? I do want it to be something that I have to, like, guide, that I am responsible for.
Griffin: Uh, Heathcliff says,
Heathcliff: Oh, that’s a breeze! Are you kiddin’? Magic knife?
Griffin: He yawns.
Heathcliff: Oh, no I don’t think I can do a magic knife. Pbsbsshhhh…
Griffin: And he ducks down into the chasm and you hear a loud sound and a flash of light and a “woosh!” as he rises back up and extends his cat paw towards you and hands you the magic knife. What’s it look like? Before we figure out its tags.
Travis: I’m going to say it’s very much like a Scottish dirk, like a small one. So there’s not like— it doesn’t have like a big cross… Oh, I’m so mad at myself that I can’t remember what that is…
Griffin: A— a guard?
Travis: Yeah, it doesn’t have a big guard or anything. It’s just like straight blade-to-handle—
Griffin: Oh, I see, I see, I see. There’s basically no guard at all, it’s just like a— [Travis: Yes.] it’s just like a handle and then a blade coming out of it. Okay, I’m into that!
Travis: And it does have, not a scabbard but a sheath that one might keep perhaps on a belt or in a boot. It’s basically like a throwing knife, you know?
Griffin: Yeah, I feel it! That’s good! Yeah, that comes out of it and it— I think it flies towards you like it knows what’s up and sort of stops as it gets close to you and rotates itself to put its handle in your direction.
Travis: And I grab it!
Griffin: Nothing else happens.
Travis: And maybe squeal a little bit, ‘cause it’s super cool!
Griffin: Okay, so I think it’s gonna have the far tag. Fart! [Everyone laughs] And I’m trying to decide if that’s like the positive tag here or if that’s kind of like a freebie that determines— I think that’s a freebie that determines its range. So what’s the other— what’s the other gear tag that’s good here? And then I’ll decide—
Travis: I mean, magic…
Griffin: Yeah, sure, magic! So it can affect certain creatures and armors that are proof against normal weapons. Yep, that’s good. The negative here will be… I mean, it’s a knife that flies around through the air, that you do not really understand how it does that. So, because you don’t really understand that, I think there’s like not a 100% guarantee that it’s going to do what you want all the time. It is a magic flying knife. I think volatile, this weapon is dangerous and unstable, is a pretty good one.
Travis: Yep, concur!
Griffin: Alright, Ned, Duck, what are you feeling? What do you want? [Unintelligible chatter, including Travis saying “What do you want?” in a weird voice]
Justin: I’ll let Ned go first.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: What are you sellin’?
Clint: Six plus three!
Griffin: Six plus three is a nine. Okay, are you trying to summon something or enchant something?
Clint: I think Ned wants to enchant the Narf Blaster 3000? Or 5000?
Travis: Well, how much are you enchanting it?
Griffin: Yeah, we can add power to it.
Travis: It’s 5000! Is that right?
Clint: I like the idea of it being even more powerful, but I also like the idea of enchanting it with life drain which transfers life energy. The wielder is healed for as many points of harm as were inflicted.
Griffin: Uh, okay?
Clint: Which sounds, you know, egotistical enough to still qualify as being Ned. And yet, you know, kind of kicks up his attack power.
Griffin: Yeah, I like that! I think— I like that a lot. I want this to happen very badly. The rule I wrote in, like, when I was writing this is that each piece of gear can only be enchanted one time. So, I think the enchantment you got last time was magic so you could shoot a ghost with it, essentially. I think you can definitely do this but maybe it replaces magic. Which like… magic only lets you hit ghosts, basically; magic is the tag that lets you kill things. So, like, swapping out magic for life drain.
Clint: Okay, yeah! So, yeah, I wanna— I hold out— Ned holds out the Narf Blaster, let’s say 5000, the Narf Blaster 5000 and tells him,
Ned: I would like this to not only hurt other people, but help me! What’ve you got, big cat?
Heathcliff: Hmm...
Griffin: He takes a look at it and he says,
Heathcliff: Didn't I already do this one?
Ned: Yeah, yeah. What, d'you got rules?
Heathcliff: I think I know what you're getting at. Hold on one second.
Griffin: And he dives down into the abyss, and this time he’s holding like this yellow orb as well as your Blaster, and now the yellow orb starts like floating in the air, and he waves his hand over the Narf Blaster, and you see this like purple light come out of it, which he then sort of forms into a ball and drops down into the abyss, and he grabs the yellow ball out of the air and pushes it into the Blaster, and then he hands it back down to you and he says,
Heathcliff: Why don’t you um… Why don’t you give that baby a blast? Just, point it at the wall for Christ’s sake, but uh, why don’t you give that a shot?
Ned: Alright-y… Oh, I don’t have to pump it or anything! I just point it here and pull the trigger!
Griffin: Uh, a— I think the way that it does the life drain— I think it’s a beam now. I think it’s a full-blown, like, Ghostbusters Proton Pack that like whips across the wall leaving a scorch mark as it goes.
Clint: And I feel awesome!
Griffin: Okay, and Duck!
Justin: Yes!
Griffin: Have you waited until last because you don’t know what you want and we’re going to get you another jetpack?
Justin: No!
Griffin: Okay, what d’you got?
Duck: Uh, Garfield?
Heathcliff: Umm… I don’t know who that is, and I wish—
Justin: Damn, fuck! Fuck me!
Clint: Good try.
Justin: I was getting convinced— confused. So I roll first and then I decide what I want to do with it? That seems wild.
Griffin: Yeah, that hasn’t been the rules but it’s what Travis and dad did, so I think if you-
Justin: Yeah, that’s like a weird thing to do. I’m not gonna do that.
Duck: I… Need… A helmet. I need a helmet.
Heathcliff: Like a foot— a football helmet? Or like a medieval—?
Duck: I— listen— like a good— like a str— like, you know how sometimes you put helmets on people who are going into dangerous situations because they’re just regular-ass people, and not like, superheroes? I need a helmet!
Heathcliff: Umm...
Duck: I need a helmet!
Heathcliff: Okay, uh… Just a regular old helmet or do you want—?
Duck: Like a good helmet you dumb cat! A helmet!
[Everyone laughs]
Griffin: He looks kind of—
Duck: Don’t fuck around with me! I’m not stoked to be asking! I need a helmet! Alright? I need a helmet.
Heathcliff:
Griffin: He looks pissed off and he’s like
Heathcliff:
Duck: Shut up! Hey! You two! Pipe down, alright? Yuck it up! I’m glad you all are still fuckin’ X-Men! I’m just a regular dipshit and I need a fuckin’ helmet!
Griffin: He says, uh—
Duck: Sorry, cat, I need a helmet.
Heathcliff: Yeah, um, I get that. Any sort of—
Duck: Pssbsbssbfffffff!
Heathcliff: —design considerations or…?
Duck: I might be wastin’ this not gettin’ a tombstone now that I think about it [everyone laughing] ‘cause them shits is expensive. I— can you give me a hologram tombstone? Nah, alright. You know what? That’s stinkin’ thinkin’. I’ll start with a helmet.
Griffin: He dives down—
Travis: And Aubrey yells,
Aubrey: Viking!
Griffin: He dives down and—
Duck: No, like cool!
Griffin: He dives down into the abyss and, uh… takes a while down there and you see like a few flashes of light and he comes back up and I think he’s got like five or six different helmet designs and he’s like,
Heathcliff: Um, you seem like you’re having maybe a bit of a— bit of a week so I thought maybe you could pick your favorite. Maybe you could have some fun with that?
Griffin: There’s like a— you know like a motorcycle helmet. There’s a viking helmet for sure. There’s a knight’s full helm with like the guard in front of it. There’s like a— sort of a modern combat helmet with some, you know, like the netting wrapped around it. I think he offers you a few different helmet designs.
Duck: Uhhh...
Aubrey (whispering): Viking! Viking!
Duck: Gimme the one that looks like a skateboard helmet. [Clint laughing]
God, at least I can wear that to work. ‘Cause I’m skateboarding to work, by the way!
Ned: So you can’t run without getting tired anymore?
Duck: I can’t run like eight miles without getting tired anymore—
Ned: What happened?
Aubrey: To be fair Ned, you can’t do that either!
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Duck: Ned— Ned— Yeah Ned you can’t run eight blocks! Shut up!
Aubrey: Got him!
Ned (mumbling): Fine. Okay. Be that way.
Griffin: I don’t want to leave it ‘til the next adventure with that negative— with that poop—
Clint: Nah, it’s ok!
Griffin: With that poo-poo argument! No I don’t want this beef lingering in the air. [beat] Uhp, well maybe it’s going to! See you next time folks!

Griffin: A clear and starry sky shines over the salt scattered parking lot outside of the Little Dipper, Kepler’s requisite dive bar and late night grill. This establishment once catered to the scientists of the Green Bank Telescope, who sought leisure after a long shift of watching the heavens. Today, it plays home to a far seedier clientele, a group that favors its own name for the bar: the Hornet’s Nest.
A trio bearing the Hornet insignia stands watch over the entrance to the bar. Harshly critiquing one anothers’ motorbikes while catching a smoke in the chill February air. One Hornet, the largest among them, tells a joke too foul and convoluted to repeat. His smaller subordinate bellows out a hearty laugh. The third, though, is distracted by a figure approaching them from across the parking lot. This Hornet boss, known as Hollis, is transfixed as the figure enters the bar, their footsteps crunching through the half-melted slurry that forms a moat around the front door.
It is 1:17 a.m., their associates’ uproarious laughter fades into the background. A silence floods Hollis’s mind. Their face goes hot and numb. Their heartbeat loud and erratic. They’re not startled by the screams coming from within the bar. In some way, they expected them. A bloody body smashes through the window beside them, toppling over the parked bikes outside. Hollis charges against the tide of fleeing patrons, their lieutenant, Keith, lay unconscious and trampled on the floor. Above him, the figure stands victoriously on a shuffleboard table. Viscera pours through its gnashed, smiling teeth. In its hand, its claw maybe, the figure holds a Hornet, too mangled to recognize. Hollis reaches above the bar and grabs a baseball bat.
It is 1:20 a.m., Hollis’s bike weaves through the trees of the Monongahela Forest in pursuit of the figure. Even on foot, this being outpaces them. The bike skids to a halt as Hollis reaches a clearing in the woods, a large circular gap among the blanket of pines. They scan the perimeter, [theme music fading in] they catch their breath, they turn on a dime and depart in the other direction. Fast away from an invisible doorway to a far flung world.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Griffin: Hello everybody, welcome back to the Adventure Zone: Amnesty, your number one source for news about… Amnesty. The whole idea of it. People are forgivin’ a lot of people, all over the world these days.
Travis: Are they?
Griffin: Not especially super very much.
Justin: [Crosstalk] Are they? Doesn’t seem to be the case.
Travis: Griffin, I have a big, important announcement.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I’ve been thinking about it for almost two weeks now. And I’ve picked a name for the flying dagger that I got in the last episode.
Griffin: Oh yeah, the trades, Trav, have been sort of buzzin’ about your dagger.
Travis: I know, I know. Listen, and I’m ready. Big reveal. I’ve nicknamed it Snitch.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: [Deep] Snitch.
Justin: I don’t—
Travis: ‘Cause it zooms around like a golden Snitch. I should say, that’s not a name Travis would pick for it. That’s the name Aubrey would pick for it.
Justin: Gotcha.
Griffin: I expect more from her than I do from Travis.
Travis: It’s not spelled like that. It’s spelled differently.
Justin: Four N’s.
Travis: Yeah.
[Griffin laughs]
Clint: [Drawn out] Sn~n~n~n~itch.
Travis: Snyatch!
Justin: There’s an Y and an A in there.
Clint: I have an announcement as well. I think in the interest of us working together and just having a good family relationship and a show. We put the whole “creps”/“crepes” controversy behind us.
Justin: Thank god, yes.
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Yeah, the trades have been buzzin’ about this one, too.
Clint: I was extremely right and you guys were harsh and mean.
[Justin sighs]
Griffin: Oh, I see.
Clint: And I think we need to put that all behind us, and not even mention it again.
Griffin: See, I saw one trade and the headline was “Clint McElroy: Old brain?” And I thought that that was mean. I think— So we know what Aubrey has kind of been doing since the Lunar Interlude. I don’t want us to, like, do a whole lot of individual scenes. ‘Cause that’s basically what the Lunar Interlude is for. But like, I think there’s some things that we need to firm up before we go into the next hunt. For instance, I wanna know what Billy’s living situation has been. I know he was sort of rooming at the Cryptonomica. I didn’t know if that was a permanent solution, I don’t know if Duck or Ned gets custody of Billy, [Justin: Not it.] your goatfriend. Okay.
Justin: Not it.
Clint: I think he’s made a home. I think… he kind of fits in, I mean in his Ryan Gosling face. Because, you know, Neil Armstrong, did we go to the moon? No, not really. The whole astronaut outer space kind of thing.
Griffin: What the—? What does that— What are you talking—? What—
Travis: [Crosstalk] Wait, hold on. Is this dad talking or like conspiracy theorist Ned Chicane talking?
Griffin: What is going on?
Travis: Because I hope this isn’t the big reveal that our dad, Clint McElroy, who we’ve known for many years, doesn’t believe in the—
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Is a fucking flat earther.
Clint: I actually am the only one of us who watched it on television, and it was very bad special effects. I mean, it did not look real.
Griffin: [Scoffs] My god.
Travis: Oh my god, I don’t know about all this, Dad.
Griffin: Okay, so—
Travis: We’re gonna get some letters.
Griffin: Dad’s a flat earther. What the fuck is Billy up to, though? The OG question.
[Travis laughs]
Clint: I think he’s just wandering around the Cryptonomica, and every so often somebody’ll come in and he’ll offer them pizza.
Justin: Okay, I have a question for you. Does he eat trash?
Travis: I mean, pizza is not good for you, Justin. Is that what you mean?
Justin: You know that’s not what it was.
Clint: [Crosstalk] Are we leaning into the cliche or are we—
Justin: Cliche of a goatman that looks like Ryan Gosling and eats trash?
Clint: I guess that’s not very cliche at all, is it? [Laughing]
Justin: No, this is a vibrant, rich world.
Griffin: He eats food adjacent trash. I don’t think he’s eaten any RC cola cans. But banana peel? Yeah, I’ll fuck with that. Some shoe laces? That’s basically cloth spaghetti.
Clint: Has he learned any more language, do you think?
Griffin: Absolutely not. I feel like I can put my foot down on that one.
Travis: It’s not about learn— I magically gave him the ability to say like six words.
Griffin: But only kind of good, yes. Aubrey, what is life at Amnesty Lodge been like? Any updates? I feel like in the last arc especially we didn’t spend a whole lot of time there. We spent a lot of time in the basement, sorta talking to spooky Thacker, but not—
Travis: I would say it’s the kind of thing where like everybody is, both because it’s the post-holidays, you know, still very gray and cold, but there’s not like a big celebration-y thing to look forward to.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Plus like how much shit has been going on, and just also kind of a vibe. I think everybody’s on edge. Everybody’s a little tense. But if you ask them “What’s wrong?” they couldn’t exactly put their finger on it. There’s just kind of a negative hum in the air. You know?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: I would say, everybody’s just on edge.
Griffin: I think a lot of that probably comes from Mama and Barclay, who— the more you all spend time with them, the more you sort of pick up on the fact that the way that the abominations are sort of changing and giving the sort of mo— the last one could change time. The more things they learn and the more direct their influence on you is, rather than just being like some mindless monster wandering the woods, like— the more they are hunting you, the more concerned they are getting, because it’s breaking this decades-long pattern.
Travis: W— and not only that, I also think between— ‘cause Aubrey, I think, has since told Mama about touching the crystal, we kind of hit— did kind of hinted at that at the end of the last arc. [Griffin: Yeah.] And then I also think on top of that, Duck bringing Billy in, and like them having— do they know that we talked with the Mothman? Did we cover that, effectively?
Griffin: I think so. I think you did drop that bomb.
Travis: So I just think that, like, also instead of things becoming more cohesive, it’s starting to feel a little more chaotic. [Griffin: Okay.] You know what I mean? Like, in— I would imagine that in the past, when they’ve recruited new members, it has made things easier? Like, smoother [Griffin: Right.] as they’ve brought in more help and we have not necessarily done that.
Griffin: I like that a lot. Ned, have you done any scouting? You— I know that you, Clint McElroy, have been doing some soul-searching about your position on this sort of ethical dilemma you find yours— it’s not much of a dilemma. Your former con-man, you know, burglar partner, your co-burglar, has asked you to do a burgle. That’s not so much of a dilemma as a bad time opportunity.
Clint: Yeah, it’s a— it’s obvious that the person he wants Ned to burgle is Mama.
Griffin: Right, right.
Clint: And I don’t think Ned is comfortable with that. I think he’s really been giving it a lot of thought… maybe was casing the joint just a little, just—
Griffin: Sure. Old habits, and whatnot.
Clint: Old habits, yeah. Using the Crêpes by Monica food truck, you know, kind of spying, seeing the possible, you know, entry points, and—
Griffin: [Laughing] What you have to understand— that would be like— that would be like, in Home Alone, when they first are driving around the neighborhood, scouting out all of the houses, if they were driving around in a van that said “The Wet Bandits: House— Christmastime House Robbers of Vacant Homes.”
Clint: Well yeah, but— see here’s the thing, Crêpes by Monica— that was a thing that was in town for a while, and so—
Justin: Alright, you need to decide right now, Mac. You said in the last episode you were going to repaint it to say Cryptonomica. So you need to decide if that fucker says Crêpes by Monica or Cryptonomica, and it can’t be like a velcro thing [Griffin: Yeah.] that you tear on and tear off.
Griffin: [Crosstalk] There will be narrative—
Justin: [Crosstalk] What does it say?
Griffin: [Crosstalk] There will be narrative and mechanical repercussions for your decision.
Justin: Also, speaking of casing joints, the one negative tag you picked for this vehicle was “obvious.” You’ve literally picked the one activity you cannot do in this vehicle!
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: You would be better to just crash it through the wall and pretend it was an accident.
Justin?: “Hey, got any valuables?”
Clint: Okay. Alright, alright. Since— Rodney? R— uh—
Griffin: Uh oh.
Clint: The— the cat that does— his assistant! Um—
Travis: Randy!
Griffin: Oh, Kirby.
Clint: Kirby! Yeah. Good God. Since Kirby is—
Griffin: Yeah, you didn’t see much of him last arc, either.
Clint: Kirby is artistic, so I say he had Kirby [slightly reluctantly] change Crêpes by Monica into Cryptonomica.
Griffin: Okay, the pact is sealed.
Travis: And that was the last time they said the C-word.
Griffin: And we can move on forever. Duck—
Travis: C-word being “crêpes”.
Griffin: Right. I mean, we shouldn’t say any iteration of the C-word, I think, on the podcast. And Duck, what’s—
Justin: No more C-words!
Griffin: Is— what’s been going on with you and Leo? Obviously your powers have diminished, and there’s some concern there. But like— you two are the, you know, only surviving members of this ancient order of chosen champions, and what’s— I imagine that’s changed the dynamic a bit?
Justin: Yeah, it was a little bit hard, I feel like, in the beginning. I have to imagine that it was a bit like having the flu. Like, comparatively, you know, to how Duck has always sort of felt. So I think that that was hard to sort of get past. I think he has found his equilibrium again, and he has… I feel like he would have been training some still, with Leo, but I definitely feel like his heart is not really in it. There is a sort of frustration, I think, because he finally decided to like actually do something with these abilities, and he lost them, and all the work that he’s putting in, all he could think is like, “God this would be easier if I still had those powers.”
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: So it’s like, it is not with a joyful heart, but he just basically has no idea what else to do.
Griffin: Mmkay. I want to pick things up in Amnesty Lodge and get the hunt going without much more delay, but before then— the previous night, last night, before sort of this hunt kicks off, you did have a dream, Duck. Obviously your powers have sort of left you, but you have a dream that feels very sort of familiar. So why don’t you go ahead and roll weird, and go on a Vision Quest.
Justin: Alright. Let me recheck my—
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Yeah, what is your plus weird now? Now that you’re a normie.
Justin: [Laughing] It’s negative one.
Griffin: Yeah. Well, that’s par for the course, I feel like.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Alright, let’s see if you can get a good, good— oh my GOD, you will never have a good vision!
Justin: Now this is a— I rolled a 5, and you subtract one from that, that’s going to give you a four right there, just right off the top.
Griffin: That’s going to be one of those fours. [Crosstalk] Have you— seriously, have you—
Justin: [Crosstalk] That one’s a four.
Griffin: The— you had the one vision of you drowning. You had the one vision of a meteor. I don’t—
Travis: Wait, so, Griffin, are you saying if he had rolled, like, a 12, he would have a vision of like sitting in an inner tube on the lazy river?
Griffin: If he had— if you roll— first of all, when you make a hard move, I get to do something bad. So it’s not just like him seeing a vision of the future, it’s me changing— it’s me making something bad happen in the future and him seeing it. And also, if he rolls really good, he can get super helpful information. He can know where to go in a pinch.
Travis: Like get in an inner tube on the lazy river.
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Yeah.
Justin: [Crosstalk] It just doesn’t happen. My dice just doesn’t— do not work that way. These visions are bad. The nice thing is, I will be able to write this one off as a nightmare until it’s too late, obviously, but it’s not going to like ruin my day. Because I don’t think I—
Travis: Oh, good!
Justin: I don’t think I have powers anymore. So I’m like, well, that was nothing. Boy, all my teeth fell out, but that was just a dream, so whatevs.
[Music fades in]
Griffin: You are hunched over Leo’s body. You’re outside. You are on concrete, in front of a big metal door going into some sort of complex that you can’t quite discern, because you’re just— you’re seeing it so close up. You are hunched over Leo, who is not breathing. And I think the vision, is not clear enough for you to see exactly why that is. And then your vision kind of pans out a little bit and zooms out, and you can see what you are sort of sitting in front of. You are sitting in front of the Green Bank Telescope. You are dwarfed in scale by this gigantic telescope, I don’t know if you’ve ever been there— probably like on a field trip or something when you were younger, Kepler is very close to Green Bank which we established in the set up episode. And the telescope— the radio telescope is pointed straight up, and as you are like, you know, trying to rouse Leo back to life, a beam of light shoots out of the tip of the antenna that makes up the radio telescope, and it shoots up into the sky, and as it does so, you wake up.
[Music swells, and fades out]
Griffin: Alright, so it’s— let’s get going. You all are at Amnesty Lodge, and I think the thing that brought you there is this, you know, massacre happened at the Little Dipper last night, and if you’re looking for things that happen every two months that seem like, “hey a monster is here!” Like, Ned, for sure the Cryptonomica wagon, your scanner technology that you have built into it— by which I mean I guess just a police scanner? I don't need to make it sound like some sci-fi shit— definitely picked up on this. So maybe it was you who rallied the troops. But you all are together at Amnesty Lodge to start doing— I feel like maybe it’s familiar for you all now, like maybe it’s old hat. Every two months it’s like, “Okay, let’s get together, let’s get the ball rolling.”
Travis: How is— who was the goober who saw me and Mothman?
Griffin: Keith.
Travis: Is Keith ok? Did Keith get killed? Keith has seen some shit, you guys.
Griffin: We did not see Keith get killed in the intro scene.
Travis: Oh, so this is like one of those, is he dead? Is he not dead? [Deeply] Well we didn’t see it happen on camera….
Griffin: No, he’s not dead.
Travis: Oh, okay.
Justin: I just remembered, you never saw me die!
[Laughter]
Travis: [Crosstalk] You never saw—!
Griffin: [Crosstalk] We can’t—
Justin: [Crosstalk] We never saw Keith die!
Griffin: We can’t, we can’t, we can’t, we can’t. We absolutely can’t. Fuckin’ complete [weird beard?]. So Barclay—
Justin: [Laughing] We never saw Griffin—
Griffin: It’s a nice casual scene at Amnesty Lodge, despite the discomfort sort of floating in the air. Barclay has made pancakes for everyone that folks are enjoying. Agent Stern has been gone all day, he’s been sort of back on the beat, patrolling the woods for any sign of Bigfoot now that most of the snow has cleared. He’s trying to find Bigfoot, who is in the other room making pancakes—
Travis: How is he still getting funding for this mission?
Griffin: Yeah, you assume that maybe that it’s a self— maybe he’s got some crowdfunding going on, for his investigation of Bigfoot. He has been out here for, what, like six months or so now? I forget how long we’ve been going. I think you started in the summertime, so maybe it’s been closer to eight months or so. It’s February now, by the way—
Justin: Has he maybe been filming the entire thing? He’s got a Patreon going?
Griffin: That’s what it is. He’s making an indie flick. And you all are sort of going over what you have heard about what happened at the Hornet’s Nest. I think Mama looks kind of concerned, anytime somebody just from the jump gets killed by one of these things, there’s obviously— that’s obviously very bad, and they— a dereliction of duty, to some extent. There is— as you all are sort of getting ready to head out the door and start your business, there is a knock at the door, and Mama opens it, and there is Deputy Dewey. And actually, just behind him in the parking lot, you see Sheriff Owens standing outside of the squad car. He’s talking on a radio, and you all head over to the door as Deputy Dewey addresses you all, and he says,
Deputy Dewey: Oh, sorry, I probably should have just come in, I know this is a hotel, I just didn’t want to be rude. How y’all doing?
Aubrey: Are you ok, Dewey?
Deputy Dewey: What d’you mean?
Ned: So let’s talk about the 718 last night at the Little Dipper bar. My long range scanners—
Duck: Whoa!
Ned: Indicate—
Aubrey: Whoa, Ned!
Deputy Dewey: Your what?
Ned: My—
Deputy Dewey: [mumbling] I know you g— you got a long range— you got a scanner?
Aubrey: No— what did you say? No, you mentioned the long range scanner— what’s up, Dewey?
Deputy Dewey: You got a license for a long range scanner? I don’t know if you need one—
Ned: Yes.
Deputy Dewey: Okay.
Ned: I got it on the internet. There was a 246-2, I understand. Just wanted to find out how you were dealing with these things.
Deputy Dewey: I always get my codes confused, I just call ‘em all 911s. But, um—
Duck: Well they are usually, I mean—
Deputy Dewey: Yeah, I just— I do have a couple questions about what happened down at the Dipper. Y’all— obviously I guess y’all heard about it, Hornets got attacked, someone came in the bar, just made a mess of things. We got two in the morgue, and a few more down at St. Francis, just hanging on— I don’t know why I’m telling you all this. Anyway, Hornets— they says they followed whoever did this up into your neck of the woods. Your— like, your actual neck of the woods? The woods here. And I was just wondering if any of y’all saw something last night.
Aubrey: Uh— no? I know that sounded suspicious, the way I said it, but the answer is [with confidence] no.
Deputy Dewey: Um, well, I guess— what were y’all doing last night? Who was actually— who was here? Are y’all actually residents, or—
Aubrey: I help out around the place. I’m, uh, you know, I’m the super. Well, hotels don’t have supers, do they?
Deputy Dewey: No, not— not especially.
Aubrey: I’m assistant manager?
Griffin: Is that a role that Aubrey has more or less filled since living here? I don’t know how you’re planning your [indistinguishable crosstalk 21:30]
Travis: I don’t know, maybe. I’m just trying to think of a way— instead of saying “I live in a hotel like the Suite Life of Zack and Cody” [indistinguishable] want to say—
[Griffin and Clint laughing]
Deputy Dewey: What about— Duck, Ned? Y’all got alibis?
Ned: We had a tech rehearsal last night for Saturday Night Dead.
Deputy Dewey: I love that one!
Ned: We’re showing Terror of Mecha-Godzilla this weekend, so we’ve got some elaborate, you know, Mecha-Godzilla puppets and stuff, so we were running through those, my staff and I.
Travis: Now I don’t know what this says about how successful Dad’s performance is, but is that true?
Clint: What, the Terror of Mecha-Godzilla?
Travis: No, like, are you guys doing that? Do you have puppets? Were you doing a tech rehearsal?
Clint: Yes! Oh, yeah!
Travis: Okay! I just— I don’t know, we just started the episode, Papa!
Griffin: Listen, Ned’s got a lot of complicated shit sort of floating around in his life, but he still makes time to put on his late night horror puppet show.
Travis: I’m just saying maybe these are the seeds that we plant where the puppets of Mecha-Godzilla might come in handy later.
Griffin: Right, yeah.
Duck: [Tense] Me— Me— Me too.
Deputy Dewey: You too what? You were—
Duck: Yup.
Deputy Dewey: Alright…
Duck: Me too. I was— Yup, I— Yup, me too, for both. Yup, me too. Mmm…
Aubrey: Duck, are you okay? You look like you need to use the bathroom.
Duck: Nope. Yeah, I do. Yup. Uh, [groans] Burritos, alright… Bye.
[Everyone laughs]
Griffin: Did Duck—
Travis: That’s what Aubrey’s gonna do from now on, whenever she can tell Duck has to lie, just prompt him to find a bathroom and hide in it.
Griffin: Yeah… It sounds like Duck’s powers actually afforded him some ability— some deception ability. Now that that’s gone, he’s at negative ten.
Justin: That’s my weird! That’s the ability to lie and that’s at negative one.
Griffin: Yeah, okay. So he says,
Deputy Dewey: Alright i mean, y’all aren’t suspects I don’t know why I’m trying to come up with alibis. Guess I'm not— I’m still gettin’ my head around this
Duck: Who uh, who beefed it?
Deputy Dewey: I shouldn’t say that. Couple of Hornets.
Travis: [Laughs] I shouldn’t say, but…
Deputy Dewey: I mean— It’s honestly, I don’t wanna be yucky, it’s kinda hard to identify them but we’ll y’know look it up in the funny papers as they would say.
Duck: I went to high school with a couple of those guys, I’m just curious.
Deputy Dewey: Did you know one that was like kinda lanky and… that’s all about all I can— brown hair maybe.
Justin: Exploded.
[Laughter]
Travis: Smushy face.
Justin: Did you go to high school with a guy who’s thorax was just smushed?
Travis: His thorax was all smushed in.
Justin: Aw Smushy Jones, yes. [Crosstalk] Love that dude, so funny!
Clint: [Crosstalk] Lanky McGee!
Travis: Love that guy.
Griffin: At this point, Sheriff Owens has like come up to join Dewey on the porch and Dewey says,
Deputy Dewey: Well you mind if I just poke our heads around? Maybe take a look around— I mean, we don’t have much to go on except for we have spotted— we have placed the attacker somewhere up here late last night.
Duck: Dewey, you and I both know the law and you know that you can’t go poking around here with our blessing. We’re not owners of this property.
Deputy Dewey: Um yeah, I don’t actually know. Hold on. Hey, Sheriff Owens, are you allowed to just go in and poke around if it’s like a business?
Griffin: And Sheriff Owens, who has my brain inside of him, shrugs because he doesn’t know.
[Laughter]
Travis: Yeah, uhm—
Justin: You can’t just go searching on properties of a— like— I don’t think you can.
Griffin: Mama actually says,
Mama: Yeah, I’ll tell you what. If you wanna poke around, we’ll go around with you. Just make sure that you get to see everything you need to see. Alright?
Griffin: And she kinda gives the three of you a look. As if to say—
Justin: I feel like Mama is able to get— I was deferring because I feel like Mama is able to give a tour [Griffin: Yes.] at this point, that looks completely legitimate.
Griffin: For sure.
Justin: And doesn’t like accidentally open the door to a room with pentagrams all over it.
[Laughter]
Griffin: Yes, yes.
Travis: And maybe doesn’t—
Griffin: [Crosstalk] If this gets you off the case then yeah, for sure. Okay.
Justin: Yeah, like Harry of Harry and the Hendersons fame isn’t taking a jacuzzi.
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: The wolfman.
Griffin: So Mama and Barclay start walking Sheriff Owens around and Deputy Dewey is kind of just hanging out with you and the guests here in the lobby.
Aubrey: Hey, Dewey, I got a quick question.
Deputy Dewey: I got one, too. Y’all making pancakes? Damn.
Aubrey: Okay… That sounds like a weird kind of flirt, but here’s my question: You said that it came up to our neck of the woods, any idea what we should keep an eye out for? Any description? Anything like that?
Deputy Dewey: It was a… y’know, a person. Hard to discern much else. It was real dark and they were wearing lots of… I guess concealing garments. Pretty big, from what they said. Probably got a decent amount of blood on ‘em. So I would hope that if you saw a big, blood soaked person in the woods somewhere, you’d know to call us ahead of time anyway. Oh, those hot springs back there look nice. Imma have to come bring the misses up here for a little R&R.
Aubrey: Gross. Do you want some pancakes?
Deputy Dewey: Not if you gonna say that the idea of me having a romantic relationship is gross, I don’t… [Justin laughing] I don’t like that.
Griffin: And he looks at the front door. He’s just kinda poking his head around, and he says,
Deputy Dewey: Oh, looks like you got a cellar over there, too. We should probably make sure it’s clean.
Aubrey: [Crosstalk] You gotta stay out. Green mold.
Deputy Dewey: Gree— Uh. Now wait a minute.
Aubrey: We— we have a team coming in to clean it up tomorrow. But for now— I mean it’s not as serious as black mold. Puh.
Deputy Dewey: Yeah.
Aubrey: Thank goodness, but we’ve been talking with the hotel… administration… administration. The HHA… and uh. Yeah, we just gotta stay out of there, Dewey, for our own health. You know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah, let’s roll plus charm on that one for a Manipulate Someone.
Travis: Ookay.
Justin: [Sing-song] Doo doo doo.
Griffin: Deputy is just trying to do his job. If you wanna keep him from doing his job, you gonna have to—
Justin: [Crosstalk] Oh, shit.
Griffin: Oh, no.
Travis: That was a 6. Hey, Ned, you wanna help?
Clint: Yes, I will.
Ned: Dewey, do you know about green mold?
Deputy Dewey: No, what’s it do to your body?
Ned: Well, let’s just say it focuses on the area below the waist and above the knees. So… as a married man—
Deputy Dewey: [Crosstalk] Wait! Wait a minute! [Laughing] If I walk into your cellar, that has green mold in it, it’s gonna mess up my weiner?
Aubrey: It’ll target your genitals. Ned’s right.
Ned: It goes right for them. It’s bad news and you know… as a married man, you’ve gotta give that some thought, my friend.
Deputy Dewey: I don’t see why my marital status would have any effect on my sort of, you know, my sexual congress habits. But…
Griffin: Go ahead and roll Help Out, Ned. This is a— We’re starting this hunt off with a bang.
Travis: C’mon, Ned.
Griffin: Let’s get the triple-5, okay.
Clint: Argh, 8.
Griffin: That’s an 8. Okay.
Travis: Hmm.
Griffin: On a 7 or 9 your help grants them +1 to your roll, but you expose yourself to trouble or danger. Which brings Aubrey up to a 7, a mixed success on a Manipulate Someone. They’ll do it, only if you do something right to show them that you mean it. I think the compromise here is, he says,
Deputy Dewey: Alright, just like open the door and I’ll like, just look down in it and just make sure.
Griffin: And with that, I don’t think he gets the ang— Like he can’t see Thacker or anything like that from the ground level. He says,
Deputy Dewey: You sure, that just looks like a basement.
Aubrey: Don’t breathe! Just don’t breathe, whatever you do.
Deputy Dewey: Okay.
Griffin: And covers his mouth.
Deputy Dewey: [Muffled] Is that a PlayStation down there?
Aubrey: Yeah, but it’s just a PlayStation 2.
Deputy Dewey: [Muffled] Oh. Y’all got Tomba.
[Justin laughing]
Aubrey: No…
Justin: What is the point of any of this?
[Laughter]
Justin: I don’t under— Can please make the show start. What is happening?
Griffin: And then a wolfman jumps in and eats his whole body.
[Travis laughing]
Griffin: He bows.
[Laughter]
Justin: Why?
Griffin: He says,
Deputy Dewey: Alright.
Griffin: They sort of regroup on the front porch, and Sheriff Owens says,
Sheriff Owens: Alright, if y’all hear anything, obviously you let us know. This is— We haven’t had a murder like this in Kepler in some time. So I guess, just keep your ear to the ground, y’all always seem to be there whenever this bad stuff happens. You let us know.
Griffin: And the two officers take off. And Mama says,
Mama: That was weird, wasn’t it?
[Ned chuckles]
Aubrey: Yeah, I guess. Do we, I don’t know, do we investigate?
Mama: Yeah.
Aubrey: [Crosstalk] Yep, that seems like a thing we do, right?
Mama: Yeah, that’s what we usually do around here. I guess yeah, it’s time for us to start hittin’ the pavement. I guess what we know is a person… but it doesn’t seem like it was a p— I mean, I’m guessing it’s not just coincidentally somebody and did some murders on the day when we’re expecting an abomination to show up. I’m thinking this sounds like abomination M-O.
Duck: Right.
Mama: Little concerning that it dragged someone back to— back up into the woods up here, ‘cause we don’t know what they’ve seen.
Aubrey: Well, it seems to me like the smartest bet would be, the three of us go investigate the scene of the crime as it were. And then maybe… Jake Cool-Ice could go see if any of the Hornets will talk to him and give him any details or anything?
Griffin: Jake Cool-Ice, who has been sort of like sitting— kind of like staring into the middle distance in the lobby, because he used to be one of these— part of this crew, says,
Jake: If you don’t mind, I’d, uh, I’d like to maybe sit this one out.
Griffin: He looks super upset. He looks bummed out.
Aubrey: Hey, you got it, buddy!
Ned: Jake, how come? Why… These guys were pretty shitty to you, last time if I remember right. Why are you upset?
Jake: I mean, we would do like picnics together, and fundraisers, and you know, we’d do stunts. We would do these late night stunt shoots, where we’d hang out and have pizza and beer afterwards. And I guess some of them got… uhm… murdered. Last night. So I don’t really want— I’m not really in the mood to [Duck grimly exhales] go out and play detective.
Duck: You—
Aubrey: [Crosstalk] And maybe, if the spirit moves you, go check on the ones in the hospital?
Jake: Yeah, that seems doable.
Duck: You need a little time, I understand. Take a break, enjoy yourself, relax, put your feet up. Us three superpowered beings [Griffin laughs] all of whom have superpowers will risk our-our hides so you can, you know, make peace with the grieving of these guys you don’t like.
Jake: Thanks. I think you were trying to be sarcastic, but I appreciate it.
Duck: I can’t— I brought it back around to sincerity. [Clint laughing] I didn’t mean to, but I could hear it happen in my voice, I decided to roll with it.
{Ad break: 32:54 - 37:43}
Griffin: You all are standing in front of the Little Dipper, which is a— I would say a sort of dive bar of somewhat ill repute, down by riverside, some ways down from where the Cryptonomica is. I think it’s close to like the east side of town, the shady side of town.
Travis: You mean there’s a lot of trees?
Griffin: Yeah. No, I mean there’s literal shade everywhere. It’s a pretty small place, I imagine like cinder block kinda build, down sort of a path. And it’s a bit removed from the main drag of Kepler. There is… The scene is kind of a mess. There’s crime tape… crime tape? I think it’s called crime tape.
Justin: [Drawn out, crosstalk] Crime tape.
Travis: [Crosstalk] Crime tape.
Justin: Yes, crime tape.
Travis: Let me check my resource guide here. Yes, crime tape.
Griffin: It’s cordoning off the building. And there are still a lot of bikes parked in front of the establishment, that are all sort off— they’ve all been toppled over. In fact, you can see some blood on some of them.
Travis: [Crosstalk] Pee-wee Herman was here.
Griffin: He did it. Yeah, there’s no bodies lying around, but you can’t get close enough to get inside the building. What with the crime tape. There are a few squad cars from the sheriff’s department here and there are a couple officers who you don’t recognize and who I’m not gonna give a name to. And yeah, I think that’s… you’re standing in a parking lot and so there’s still trace amounts of snow, that has been melted with salt, around. And you can see lots of footprints sort of going in the direction away from the building. And you also see a pretty good amount of just red snow in a splatter coming out of the building. And… yeah. Standing sort of, close to your position, sort of off the road as you come in, and outside of the perimeter of the crime tape you see two Hornets, two guys. One is a much bigger fella than the other one, both wearing sort of the jackets with the Hornets insignia on the back of it. The littler one of the two of them is sort of nervously smoking as you all approach. And that is the scene. Begin investigation.
Travis: Griffin, kinda the first thing, I think, if I were Aubrey. That Aubrey would wanna do. Look around, do I see any CCTV cameras?
Griffin: Oh interesting. I mean, definitely not. This is not that place.
Travis: Hmm.
Griffin: I do not think. Maybe it should be that place because of the type of patron that comes here. But no I don’t think, necessarily, they’re gonna have that.
Justin: What about… I wanna look behind the bar. Is there any… is there a…? I would imagine that a place like this prolly has a weapon there. I’m curious if it was drawn or if things happened too quickly.
Travis: Oh, I see.
Griffin: Oh, you actually wanna like get in the building and look behind the bar?
Justin: Yeah, I think I’m just gonna go in there. Flash my badge to the dipshit at the door.
Clint: [Crosstalk] Yeah, he’s the only one with a badge.
Griffin: Oh, okay. I like that justification, I think the sheriff’s, deputies who… because they’re nameless, maybe there’s so many people working on the sheriff’s department that they don’t know that you aren’t one of them. They just see the badge and like “yeah, headon through.”
Travis: Aubrey stays out to talk to the two Hornets.
Griffin: Okay, and Ned? What are you doing?
Clint: I’m going to look around the grounds.
Griffin: Okay, just sort of in general see what you can see?
Clint: Well, I want it— I wanna look for drag marks. I wanna look for any sign of the body being dragged away from the bar.
Griffin: Okay. Duck, why don’t we start with you? Because you’re gonna get a lot of sort of info just walking into the bar. Not that it’s gonna be especially useful info. It looks like a bomb went off in here. There are broken chairs all over, there are some broken tables. There’s a big mirror sort of behind the bar, and that’s just been shattered. There’s a big window leading out to the front of the bar, that’s been shattered. And in fact, as you get closer to these bikes, you can tell that the glass went outwards and somebody was probably thrown through it, old school saloon style. And just landed flat on those bikes. There’s just a lot of blood. There’s a shuffleboard table that is just caked in it. This is— I mean, y’all been huntin’ monsters for a while, this is definitely the grizzliest thing you have seen since being in this business.
Justin: And this is like— Would you say that this is a scary situation? Like, I don’t necessarily 100% know that I’m safe in here?
Griffin: Uhm, I don’t— I mean, since the sheriff’s been here for a while and the perimeter has been setup here for a while, and the blood’s all like super dry. You assume there’s nothing— whatever did this is not here right now.
Justin: Alright.
Griffin: I don’t think you feeling in a lot of danger.
Justin: Just trying to milk an experience point outta you but that’s fair.
Griffin: [Laughs] Oh, I mean what’s the question? Because you— I mean, Justin—
Justin: It’s literally, if I go off by myself to check out somewhere or something scary mark experience. I wouldn’t necessary—
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Go ahead and mark experience. Justin, if you walked into a fucking bar that people got killed in last night, I think you’d be [Justin: Scary.] fucking scared, yeah. And right now you, Justin, are as powerful, if not more powerful than your character Duck Newton.
Justin: Yeah, ‘cause I got a blue belt.
Griffin: Yeah, you do have a blue belt. You could kick this— this thing. Yeah, go ahead and mark experience. And also, if you want to do this investigation you were talking about, go ahead and roll Investigate a Mystery for me.
Justin: Oookay.
Griffin: This stuff I just said, you got just from walking in and you could see.
Justin: Son of a—
Griffin: Holy shit, Justin. That’s a 4.
Justin: 4!
Griffin: Big 4. Plus—
Justin: Why do my rolls have to be mundane.
Travis: [Crosstalk] Pull a Luck, my dude.
Justin: Like why do my rolls have to be mundane?
Griffin: Yeah, you could drop a Luck point. What’s your sharp now that you’re mundane?
Justin: One.
Griffin: Yeah, I mean, a Luck is the only way you’re gonna turn this into a victory. But I don’t know if you wanna…
Justin: [Sighs] It’s just to like investigate, right?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: This seems like very important, though. I’d hate to like…
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: I’ve never use Luck, and I could get those back somehow?
Griffin: No, your Luck is an expendable resource. But I’m saying, we’re more than halfway through this campaign. You haven’t used any Luck. Like you’re sitting on—
Justin: [Crosstalk] Yeah, you know what? Just this one time. I worked very hard to get in here. I had to rationalize a lot of stuff.
Griffin: Okay, that bumps—
Justin: [Crosstalk] I spend a Luck point.
Griffin: Cool, you get a complete success. You hold two and you get to ask one of these questions: “What happened here? What sort of creature is it? What can it do? What can hurt it? Where did it go? What was it going to do? What is being concealed here?”
Justin: Uhm.
Griffin: I love that there’s advanced moves which I don’t think any of you guys have taken. I think you have to level up five times before you can take them, which you all probably are close to now. And the advanced move for Investigate a Mystery is that you can ask a question— you can ask any question you want about the mystery, not just the listed ones. Which seems a little OP. Who did it? What is it? How do I kill?
Justin: What sort of creature is it?
Griffin: Uhm, okay… A woman walks up to you, wearing the sheriff’s department uniform. And she’s taking some pictures of the scene as you walk in, and she says,
Woman: Hey, I don’t recognize you. Are you—? Hey, who are you? What are you doing here?
Duck: My name is Duck Newton and I am looking for… information about what occurred here.
Woman: You a journalist?
Duck: I am a… badged professional.
[Clint laughing in the background]
Woman: That’s good enough for me.
[Travis laughing]
Woman: Yeah, it’s a gnarly sight, huh? Been working at the sheriff’s department for a few years now, I ain’t never seen nothing like this. I didn’t think stuff like this happen’ in Kepler.
Duck: What was your name?
Woman: My name… My name is Megan.
Griffin: There’s probably a listener of our show named Megan, it’s you. I didn’t know that this character was going to exist, an hour ago.
Justin: ‘Cause Duck’s a rude piece of shit.
Griffin: Yeah.
Megan: I’m Detective Megan… Lastname and I’m here— You ever seen anything like this?
Duck: Yeah, I mean a little bit. Not exactly to this extend of brutality, but I’ve got a little more experience than I like with sort of unexplained situations.
Megan: Tell me about unexplained. I was down at the morgue, I helped get the bodies down there, and it’s one thing to like, you know, murder someone. One of these Hornets had a big chunk missing out of his neck. And there’s teeth marks on it? [Duck gasps] It looked like somebody just chunked right down on him. Had himself a lil dude snack. And what kinda stuff do you gotta be on to do something heinous like that? I swear, I thought Kepler was different, safe from stuff like this. But I’m gonna move back to Chicago, you know? I’m gonna move back to— That’s not where I’m from, but you know what I mean? It’s a figure of speech.
Duck: Yeah, back to Chicago, like they say.
[Laughter]
Griffin: I think that’s as much as you’re gonna get in here for “What sort of creature is it,” since the creature is not here.
Justin: So you have “chomped down on the neck?” Is that what we have established?
Griffin: Yes, you have one more question.
Justin: Is there any reality in which “What can hurt it?”— I mean, that’s one of my questions, but there’s just no… Like, it doesn’t make sense, right? Like no reality would make me have [wheezing] access to that information.
Griffin: I mean…
Justin: I can ask a different one that feels more narratively sound.
Griffin: Yeah.
Duck: So… Megan, what— Detective Megan, excuse me, what happened here? As near as you can tell. I mean, did this thing just take these guys just straight to Chicago, or?
[Laughter]
Duck: How did all shake out?
Megan: Well, we’ve talked to a few people, who were in here when the person came in…
Duck: And it was a person?
Megan: Yeah, it— What else would it been?
Duck: I mean, wild animals? You know, this part of town. It’s a possibility.
Megan: I mean, what I understand is, the person acted like a wild animal what with the dude snack. Just came in through the door, didn’t seem to be provoked, nobody here seemed to know who they were. They came in and they just started killing, and clawing, and people said that— picked up a table like it weren’t nothing. Threw somebody all the way across the room, like 20 feet. Moving around and just chucking people like they were Superman or something like this. But if Superman you know, bit people.
Duck: [Quietly] Bit people.
Megan: Just came in here and did its killing. And then once everybody taken off, they took flight—
Duck: [Crosstalk] Right back to Chicago!
Megan: Right on back. [Justin giggling] Yeah.
Duck: Well, I appreciate you talk with me, Detective Megan. Imma let you right back to Chicago and Imma go talk to my guys over there in Chicago, and we’re gonna get right back to Chicago.
Megan: Yep, that was all correct usage of idiom, so well done.
Justin: [Giggling] “Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.”
Griffin: Aubrey, you are back out in the parking lot and you— we’re going to speak to the two Hornets that you saw. The big one and the little one.
Travis: Do I recognize either of them?
Griffin: You probably saw them during the ski trip confrontation. They were definitely there, helping make the stunt video up on Mt. Kepler. But you’re not like super fam— You know, it’s not Hollis, it’s not Keith.
Travis: Gotcha.
Aubrey: Hey… Hey there, fellas. How are you holding up?
Bigger Hornet: Uhm… Y’know, I’ve been better. Are you like grief counselor?
Littler Hornet: Yeah, you grief counselor?
Aubrey: I do have some counselling experience, but right now, think of me more as your friend.
Bigger Hornet: I could really use a grief counselor more than friend, at the moment. I got—
Aubrey: Okay, then I’m a grief counselor. Yes.
[Clint laughing]
Littler Hornet: I’m just saying, we’ve got friends.
Aubrey: Okay. No, I follow— Okay.
Bigger Hornet: [Crosstalk] Yeah, through all of this, we’ve got each other. And I’m thanking the lord for that.
Aubrey: That’s absolutely beautiful. I am a grief counselor. What are your names?
Justin: Be careful, Trav. He doesn’t always have names. Sometimes he’ll make you feel like a heathen for asking names.
[Clint laughing]
Bigger Hornet: My name’s Beven.
Littler Hornet: And my name’s Tim.
Aubrey: Okay, Tim, Beven… You know, I find that with traumatic experiences like this, sometimes it helps to talk about what happened. Because often times we’ll close ourselves off to it, not really let ourselves live through the experience. And that’s where we get haunted by the past. But as we let ourselves discuss it, we can oftentimes break through that wall and make it something in the past rather than something we’re still living in, in the present.
Beven: Are we gonna get to talk to each other through dolls at some point? I heard that’s sorta the main thing that you do.
Aubrey: We’ll get to that, but you have to earn that. Okay, Beven? Gotta earn that. With my trust. So how about… first start by just telling me what happened.
Griffin: Let’s roll Investigate a Mystery. Is your magic— I’ve mention your magic eye power, that’s for… what is it? The other one…
Travis: Read a Bad Situation?
Griffin: Read a Bad Situation, right.
Travis: Investigate a Mystery, that’s plus sharp… an 8. So I get to hold one.
Aubrey: So how about you tell me what you’ve closed off. What haven’t you told the police? What’s that thing, where you’re like “They would never believe this?” You can open up to me. I’m here to believe you.
Travis: And that question is, “What’s being concealed here?”
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, I got a good one for that. Beven looks around and says,
Beven: You’re gonna think I’m telling tales outta school or, y’know just making up— just poppycock.
Tim: Yeah, it’s gonna sound like poppycock.
Aubrey: Beven, I would never— Tim, don’t use that kind of language. Beven, I would never.
Beven: So we were standing out front of the bar, just sort of catching a lungful of that good smoke from a cigarette. I smoke a lot, I look cool when I do it. But anyway, we’re out there in front with Hollis. We watched the person walk in. And I wasn’t paying a lot of attention to when they walked in. But I notice some— And they came into the parking lot, and it was— It looked like a kind of, I mean, I wanna say small. But like, everyone’s kinda small to me, ‘cause I’m a pretty big man.
Tim: The biggest man!
Aubrey: Okay.
Beven: Thanks, Tim, that’s sweet. It’s like this blonde lady. She had her hood pulled up, but I could see some of her hair. And she was just about Tim-sized, I would say.
Aubrey: [Quiet] Blonde lady?
Beven: Yeah. She was the one that came in—
Justin: Tim-sized blonde lady.
Beven: And she came in, to the bar. I didn’t see, payin’ no mind. Hollis seemed kinda spooked for whatever reason. And then… you know. The stuff happened. And I was on my way out and I doubled back, ‘cause I was like “my bike, my bike!” And I was like, I don’t wanna get torn apart like everybody else but I do need to get my bike. So I started to head back and saw her again, but this time like… she was way different. She was— She was— Now she wasn’t Tim-sized, you’re not gonna believe this, now she was Beven-sized. She was huge and she was different. She still had her hood up, so I couldn’t make out her face a whole lot. But obviously it was sort of a— what’s the word? Like a grim mask of death. It’s like she’s— You ever seen Transformers?
Aubrey: Yeah.
Beven: It’s like one of those.
Clint: [Whispering] Another Transformers reference.
Justin: That’s two in two episodes. Transformers are coming to this arc, I can feel it.
Clint: You did, they are so coming.
Aubrey: Did— Hey, Beven?
Beven: Yeah.
Aubrey: Did you see her teeth?
Beven: No, I was too far away for that. I mean, her face, what I could see, was covered in a lot of blood. So there’s that. But yeah. That’s all I got. So, I gotta say, I’m not feeling less grievous. I guess.
[Justin giggling]
Aubrey: No, you’ve made a great start. Uhm. Drink lots of water.
Beven: Great.
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: Ned, why don’t you— You’re walking around the grounds. You’re just trying to like see what you can see, right?
Clint: Yeah, Ned walks around the— like, behind the bar. Around the edge of the wooded area, and it suddenly occurs to Ned that he’s [clicking] not fucking Bindi Irwin and doesn’t know a damn thing about looking for tracks in the woods, [Griffin: Yeah.] and the ground. So, he doesn’t wanna go back so quick ‘cause they’ll know that he was a big failure. So he kinda leans up against the dumpster and starts munching on some Slim Jims that he had in his pocket.
Travis: What is going on?
Clint: And he’s just—
Travis: [Crosstalk] Ned’s just taking a break from the game real quick.
Clint: And he’s just looking around. [Travis laughing] He knows, he was kinda bein’ all “[Ned voice] I’ll look for clues” and you know, trying to impress his buddies. And now he realizes, he doesn’t know anything about this shit. He’s just gonna sit there with this Slim Jim and after a few minutes go back. And that’s how he’s gonna Investigate a Mystery.
Griffin: [Amused] Well, then go ahead and roll Investigate a Mystery.
Clint: Alright… 3!
Griffin: Oh. My. God!
Clint: Plus—
Travis: [Crosstalk] That totally fits the narrative you just set up.
Clint: Plus 2 for sharp.
Griffin: It’s a 5.
Travis: So now instead of being a huge failure, it’s just a huge failure.
Griffin: This is a big failure, instead of a huge one. Uhm… man. Okay, I’m gonna do a hard move, and this is the move. And I will also give you a little something. You were standing here idly watching… nothing, I guess. Eating your Slim Jims, your dumpster Slim Jim break, Ned, you absolute raccoon.
Clint: It’s one of the like 3 foot ones, that you pick up—
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Yeah, sure. [Music fades in] You are sitting there, just idly looking around. And you see what looks like this string of light, that is just kind of hovering in the air. And it’s super faint, you probably wouldn’t have noticed it, if you hadn’t been standing here for a while and seen the light change, the clouds move overhead, and notice this thing. I think you only see it for a little bit, this like little rift floating in the air. And as you start to approach it, something happens. You see this rift like [stuttering] o-open up? Just like slightly, just like a half inch. And behind it you see an eyeball looking at you. And just as quickly as you’ve noticed it, it disappears.
You all are back at Amnesty Lodge [music fades out] to regroup with Mama and Barclay. Jake Cool-Ice also went to the hospital and is there, as you all are sort of gathering up all of information. And I think he opens up, and you can tell he’s had a long, difficult day. And he says,
Jake: So, uh… Yeah. Apparently only a couple people got killed, but those that made it out didn’t— I can’t say they’re doing super great. A couple of ‘em got… got bit. And a couple just got, you know, beat up, and thrown around, and got some fractured collar bones and arms. And whatever did this, it did it with… intent. So, that’s all I could get. Now I’m going to go and take a dip in the springs, and just listen to some smooth jazz or something. ‘Cause I need something to take the edge off.
Griffin: And Mama says,
Mama: Alright, we got somebody bitin’ people, we got super strength, and they turned big and scary, anything else?
Travis: I just FYI, I think Aubrey has specifically left out the blonde hair detail.
Griffin: Okay.
Ned: There was an eyeball. An eyeball looking at me through a rift.
Mama: Well, that’s peculiar, Ned. You sh— and you didn’t open up with the eyeball rift?
Ned: I was looking for the opportunity! I didn’t want to just leap into it. I wanted to work it into a narrative flow. Build to it and then say something like [dramatic] “And a rift! I saw a rift!”
Duck: Yeah.
Mama: [Sighs] Duck, you got anything to contribute here?
Duck: Uhh, I mean it’s sorta been covered, it— I mean with the chomping. Got that.
Mama: Yeah.
Duck: Uh, it was a— on my report here that I took from A— was listenin’ in with Aubrey. And it says, “one Tim-sized blonde lady”. So that is the closest to a description.
[Clint wheezes]
Travis: Didn’t say blonde. Kept that to myself.
Griffin: Yeah, definitely didn’t say that.
Justin: Okay.
Duck: “One Tim-sized lady”, and no descriptions on the vics, except that they got messed up pretty bad. Also there was no provocation, I should mention also, that it seems like… just came in and started attacking people.
Aubrey: But does seem like intent— It like walked right into this place.
Duck: [Crosstalk] Right, yeah, it seemed intentional. Doesn’t seem like somebody picked a fight.
Griffin: Obviously like, the reason you’re keeping the description sort of concealed, Aubrey, is obvious. But I think, Barclay is, even without the hair color, right there with you. He looks super nervous and says,
Barclay: Uh-huh, okay. If it’s… Are we talking about an old school vampire, because that could be kind of problematic.
Griffin: And I think he’s just looking at Dani while he’s talking about this, and says,
Barclay: I don’t— She seems fine and I don’t think she’s been skipping on trips—
Aubrey: [Crosstalk] It’s not Dani.
Barclay: I know it’s not Dani, but like… if the wind moves in that dire— if people start following clues like, she’s kind of a—
Aubrey: Hey, Barclay, we don’t need to jump to Chicago, okay?
Barclay: Okay.
Aubrey: We’ve got still tons of information we don’t have.
Griffin: As you all are sort of talking about this, you are… I imagine you’re down in the basement, the cellar, so that nobody— you don’t drop any big clues in front of Stern. And the ceiling starts to rumble. You hear the sounds of motors outside. Up above you, outside of the cellar, in the front yard of the parking lot of Amnesty Lodge.
Aubrey: Oh, thank god. The Fast and the Furious crew are here, now we’re safe.
Griffin: And like really quickly Mama and Barclay look at each other kind of like weirded out and start heading out to the surface. And as they open the door and you all kind of poke your head out of the cellar, you are temporarily blinded by this row of bright headlights shining in your direction. They all flick off one by one and you see what was hiding behind them. Parked in formation in front of Amnesty Lodge is a fleet of 20 motorbikes ridden by Hornets with Hollis at the lead. They take off their helmet and approach the lot of you as you all step out of the cellar. You see Keith just sort of, just behind them. And Keith, as he takes off his helmet, looks genuinely— locks eyes with you, Aubrey, and then looks very scared. And Hollis approaches you all as you come out of the cellar and says,
Hollis: So you all heard what happened at our place last night, right?
Aubrey: Yeah.
Duck: [Drawn out] Yep. Real sorry about it.
Hollis: Yeah, it’s awful. So Keith told me everything about the monsters. Told me that you all work to fight them and keep it a big secret.
[Clint snorting]
Duck: Uhm.
Aubrey: Huh. Hey, Keith? Hollis? Can we talk to you over here just for a mo?
Griffin: Hollis says,
Hollis: I’m good. I’m new with this obviously, but is the plan that you usually keep us, you know the rest of the town, in the dark and then after someone gets slaughtered then you step in to clean up the mess? Is that how—
Ned: [Crosstalk] That’s been working so far for us.
Aubrey: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Hollis: Okay. Well, good news. You don’t need to know what I’m talking about anymore. You all are relieved of duty, [beat] we’ll take it from here.

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Deputy Dewey: Y’all— obviously I guess y’all heard about it, Hornets got attacked, someone came in the bar, just made a mess of things. We got two in the morgue… they says, they followed whoever did this up into your neck of the woods.
Megan: One of these Hornets had a big chunk missing out of his neck.
Bevin: It’s like this blonde lady. I saw her again, but this time like… she was way different.
Griffin: Parked in formation in front of Amnesty Lodge is a fleet of 20 motorbikes ridden by Hornets with Hollis at the lead.
Hollis: So Keith told me everything about the monsters. Told me that you all work to fight them and keep it a big secret?
[Clint snorting]
Duck: Uhm.
Aubrey: Huh.
Hollis: Good news. You don’t need to know what I’m talking about anymore. You all are relieved of duty, we’ll take it from here.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
{1:42}
Griffin: Should we just pick it up right where we left off? ‘Cause it was kind of a, kind of a hot scene if you…
Clint: [Crosstalk] Chyeah!
Justin: I don’t know why we always have to talk a bunch of garbage.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: You know what I mean? Like—
Travis: [Crosstalk] That— It’s called a podcast, Justin.
Griffin: No, yeah, you’re right, let’s get it wet. Uh—
Justin: I just, like— Let’s get it wet.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure.
Justin: [Crosstalk] You know? Thank you.
Travis: Let’s get wet and wild.
Griffin: You all are standing in front of Amnesty Lodge where you have just sort of come out of your secret cellar headquarters alongside Mama and Barclay. And standing in front of you… well, actually, kind of leaning against a cool motorbike is Hollis, who is the leader of the Hornets, the local stunt crew turned kinda bike squad who are sort of in the process of confronting you. There’s a little over a dozen of them here parked out in front of Amnesty Lodge. And now that you understand their intention, you’re kind of able to look them over a little bit better. They are wielding baseball bats and makeshift sort of rebar clubs and all sorts of weaponry.
Travis: So, a mob?
Griffin: Kind of a mob, yeah. A monster-hunting mob. And standing in front of you is Hollis, along with Lieutenant Keith, and they have said that they are going to take over monster hunting from this point forward because you all are not getting it done. That’s where we’re at. And time: UNFREEZE! Zowie!
Travis: I’ve been thinking about this because we have the benefit of not being in real time.
Griffin: Well, time: freeze. Hold on. Okay, time: freeze.
Travis: Yeah, time: freeze.
Griffin: Zap, zop.
Travis: Now time: unfreeze.
Griffin: Okay.
[Pause]
Travis: Unfreeze it!
Griffin: Okay, it’s unfreezed, I’m sorry.
Travis: Aubrey just kind of laughs, like,
Aubrey: Ha ha. Monsters! Are you kidding me?! Ugh. I told Keith. He— Listen. He got a bonk on the head when he crashed off his bike. We found him like that. He was in a daze. I think he might have a concussion. You know how that is; you do stunts, right? Concussions have to be a major worry for you guys. He kept going on and on about monsters and stuff. And, I don’t know. Ha ha! Monsters!
Griffin: I think Hollis just kinda stares you down and doesn’t really say anything. Doesn’t seem to be moved by your speech. And then they turn towards Duck, and then they say,
Hollis: I wanna hear it from him.
Duck: [Gulps] What exactly do you wanna hear me say?
Hollis: Well, you’re carrying a sword, I’m—
Griffin: Are you carrying a sword‽ I don’t know if that’s something that Duck just kinda rolls around with.
Justin: I always assumed that it looked like a belt, when he wasn’t wearing it.
Griffin: [Laughing] I love that, we’ve never talked about that before. Your belt sword.
Justin: I just always assumed that he looked like a belt.
Griffin: Okay, yeah that works. Okay.
Justin: And it’s a little bit Hot Topic— [laughing]
Griffin: I think it’s exceedingly Hot Topic, it’s a belt with the— I guess the buckle is a mouth. That’s horny, kind of.
Travis: [Laughs] It is a little horny!
Justin: And it’s metal. It was either that, or as a wallet chain… sword.
Griffin: Hollis says,
[Clint laughing]
Hollis: Well, according to what Keith told me, all of you were there when the, I guess, goatmen attacked.
[Aubrey gives a short laugh]
Hollis: Which I’m assuming is one of the kind of monsters that seem to besiege our hometown on a daily basis…? So, I was just wondering if you were going to outright lie about it, like Aubrey here.
Duck: Uhm… I’m not a monster-hunter with any special abilities or anything. I have no physical advantage over anybody else that would be trying to hunt monsters. Look at me for a second. Honestly. If I could… y’know, do that sort of thing, wouldn’t that be… something a little more intense than a forest ranger?
Hollis: Yeah, that’s actually the first believable thing that any of you have said since I showed up here. Ned? You seem to know a lot about monsters, it’s kind of your business. It seems like maybe business is a lot better than anybody even expected, huh?
Ned: Well, here’s what I’m thinking, friend Hollis, that perhaps there’s a lot of confusion out there [chuckles]. As you know, I have an extremely successful television show called Saturday Night Dead, and—
Hollis: Yeah, you reference that every episode.
Ned: Yes. And as you know, what we do is, we not only show great movies— By the way, you may be especially interested, this weekend we have a double feature Werewolves on Wheels from 1971 with Severn Darden, and 1989s Chopper Chicks in Zombietown [Justin laughing] with Billy Bob Thornton.
Hollis: You’re not gonna win me over by—
Ned: No, no, no, no! I’m just saying—
Griffin: While Hollis is saying that, they have their phone out and are definitely adding this to their Gcal.
Ned: I would love you’d all to come and sit in the studio audience. But be that as it may, we also do a lot of crazy video features, a lot of filmed features that we insert in the show. We’ve been doing a lot of shootings. We have a young man, looks exactly like Ryan Gosling, with higher aspirations [Aubrey: Spitting image.] Spitting image. And sometimes we make him up in goat… makeup to shoot wild and crazy skits.
Aubrey: Yeah, that was for the— we were doing the Krampus thing, right?
Duck: [Mumbling] Skits. Yes.
Aubrey: We were doing like a Krampus thing with like goat legs.
Ned: [Crosstalk] Krampus thing… And it’s possible that Keith saw that.
Duck: [Tense] We do zany— They’re right, we do zany skits. They call us… the Zoo Team, and we’re always doing wild stuff.
Ned: [Hastily] Yeah, why don’t you let me take this, Duck? And so anyway—
[Justin snorts]
Hollis: Two of my guys were torn to shreds last night, [Ned: Yes, right.] and I saw that thing that did it. And it wasn’t your handsome friend all dressed up like a goat.
Duck: What did you— Hey, what did you see, Keith?
Griffin: This is Hollis talking.
Duck: What did you see, Hollis?
Griffin: I think if you actually want something from Hollis, who’s like
Justin: [Crosstalk] I’m sorry, it’s so hard. With Hollis’s deep multi-textured character voice it’s hard to tell— [laughing] tell the two of ‘em apart.
Griffin: Listen, I think anybody who doesn’t have a rich Appalachian accent is kind of an outlier in this universe that we’re crafting.
Justin: Fair enough.
Travis: Fair!
Griffin: I think Hollis is coming at you all kind of like hot and bothered— Well, not hot and bothered, that sounds weird.
Travis: Ooh. [Laughs]
Griffin: Kinda angry, so if you want something from Hollis, Duck, you’re gonna have to roll Investigate a Mystery.
Justin: [Sighs] You know I am gonna do that.
Griffin: ‘Kay.
Justin: I’m gonna do exactly the thing that you just said.
Griffin: You don’t have to.
Justin: No no no!
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Hollis can just say “Fuck off!” and then you don’t have to.
Justin: Hey listen, we do not have a lot in the way of leads, and two of the leads that we did have got eaten. So, I don’t love our chances right now, so I’m gonna take every opportunity that I can get and I’m gonna roll 2d6. God almighty. Hachi machi.
Travis: [Mocking] How did you do, Justin?
Justin: Well, I got a 4 on that one, Trav.
Travis: Wheew.
Justin: We call in the biz, we call that bad. Less than ideal. [Mumbling] Experience…
Griffin: I think this just ends the— Yeah, mark experience, well done. I think this just ends the conversation, I think that Hollis says,
Hollis: [Laughs] You think I’m gonna help you? I told you, the era of you all keeping the town in the dark, while you sneak around and fail to stop these things from killing people, that era is over.
[Duck sighs]
Hollis: Yeah, I’ve got a question actually for you, and I’m only gonna ask it once politely. Where are these things coming from?
Griffin: And it’s right then that the front door to Amnesty Lodge swings open and out walks Agent Stern, who is dressed in full proper FBI agent regalia. He actually got his hands on his hips pulling his jacket back, so everyone can see his badge. He says,
Agent Stern: Everything going okay out here?
Ned: Oh, yes! Agent Stern, our friends here were just leaving, they were just setting out. They’re on a mission from God. And we say to them, and I mean this most sincerely, Hollis, go for it. Knock yourselves out, go on your little mission, and godspeed.
Griffin: With that, I think Keith is now nervous that, y’know, a badged official is here, and sort of tugs at Hollis’s sleeve. Who nods and they put their helmet back on, and everybody else in the Hornets sort of follow suit.
Aubrey: Real quick, Keith, before you go. Let’s hang out sometime, you and I. We’ve got some catching up to do.
Griffin: Keith lifts his visor up and he walks over and he says,
Keith: Everyone saw it. I know what we talked about, Aubrey, everyone saw it. And you can threaten to kill me all you want, but apparently there’s other stuff out there that’s actually doing it.
Ned: [Laughing, crosstalk] Kill you. He’s kidding, Stern, he’s kidding.
Duck: Hollis and Keith, let me talk to you guys real quick before you head off.
Hollis: Okay.
Griffin: Yeah, Hollis comes over and joins with you.
Justin: I walk out with them. They’re leaving, I walk out.
Duck: So here’s the thing. This thing is messed up, I mean whatever it is, it’s brutal. And you saw that, and we did too. I don’t know if I should be telling you this or not, but we’ve… dealt with some stuff like this already. And I’m here to tell you that we’ve barely made it out alive. And if you go looking for this thing, it is going to kill you.
Justin: So this is a move called Trust Me [Griffin: Oh, shit!] the Mundane can do. And if I tell a normal person the truth in order to protect them from danger, I roll plus charm. On a 10+ they’ll do what I say, no questions asked. 7 to 9 they’ll do it but the Keeper choses one from a list which includes, they ask me a hard question, they stall and dither a while, they have a better idea. On a miss, they’re gonna think I’m crazy and maybe dangerous, too.
Griffin: Oh, this is such a fucking cool move. And it’s also something I didn’t know was in the game. It could totally… rewrite shit. Alright, let’s see it.
Travis: Yeaaah! We’re doing it, classic McElroy!
Griffin: Yeah, let’s see what you got. Another big 4—? Okay!
Justin: That’s a 7 plus 2 charm is a 9. Which you get one of those, you can stall and dither, have a, quote, “better idea,” or ask me a hard question first. So I think that’s probably open to interpretation, how you wanna interpret this. I definitely had some effect, I think, but I can see where—
Clint: [Crosstalk] Could Ned help out and add a point?
Justin: I think a mixed success is probably more interesting for Griffin [Clint: Okay.], in the sense that like it gives Griffin more—
Travis: [Crosstalk] That works, I think it makes sense for this scenario, too.
Justin: Especially after that hard… like after I had that hard failure, it seems like a mixed success seems alright.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure, I like this. Okay so, I’m gonna go with “Ask you a hard question” first, and it’s gonna be in this form. It’s going to be… Hollis lifts up their visor and they stare you down, Duck, and they say,
Hollis: I don’t think you’re lying about that either, Duck, but if you really want us not help protect the town like you’ve been doing for god knows how long, then we need to know the truth. And we need to know all of it. When you’re ready to do that, just flag down a Hornet, we’re gonna be all over town on patrol, so… I’ll see ya hopefully when I see ya.
Griffin: And they lower their visor down and the Hornets depart. Basically saying like, if you tell them literally everything that you know about the Pine Guard, and no like clever ruses, like actually what is going on here, everything you know. Then they will disband their monster-hunting force as it is now. That’s the tradeoff.
Justin: Okay, so I probably go— I go back inside and I flag down Aubrey and Ned, and I sort of update them on the scenario. So there’s—
Duck: So that’s basically it. They’ll [sighs] keep their heads out of it, if we tell them everything.
Aubrey: Well, I have to say… I mean, there’s a part in me that doesn’t mind the idea of this like “neighbourhood watch beefin’ up our numbers” kinda deal, like, eyes on the street. But at the same time, I don’t know their methods, and they seemed pretty hell bent for leather as far as violence goes. We got a lot of not bad monster types, you know what I mean?
Duck: Mhmm.
Ned: I have an idea that might lend itself to that situation. Kirby! Kirby, come here for a moment.
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Wait, why is Kirby—? [Amused] I guess you did take a move where he’s your constant companion. A fucking closet in the cellar of the—
Travis: There’s a poof of smoke and Kirby appears.
Griffin: A closet door in the cellar under Amnesty Lodge swings open and Kirby comes out.
Justin: [Laughing] It like bursts open.
Clint: Alright, I will do it that way— Back up, let me try it a different way.
Ned: I have an idea, why don’t I send Kirby out in the Cryptonomica van, with the camera drones from episode hm… six? [Griffin bursts out laughing] to keep an eye on our friends the Bumblebees, and he can report back to us and see what they do.
Griffin: There’s so much wrong stuff in that sentence.
Duck: There’s a few wrong things. Let me see, let me try and go in order. First one is, your man Kirby might just have to watch gang member get eaten alive. ‘Cause I don’t think this thing is like… like luring friends back to its place and stealing their identity and then over several months— It’s just eatin’ people.
Aubrey: Can we agree that identity thieves are the real monsters?
Duck: Yeah, I mean, I’m no great fan of identity thieves, but like—
Ned: You said you wanted to know about their methods, you said—
Duck: I don’t know, I didn’t say anything of the sort! What I said was, we need to decide if we want to tell them everything or if we wanna let them take their chances.
Ned: I’m already in enough deep shit with Mama and, and, and… Squatchboy about runnin’ my mouth. So I vote we don’t tell ‘em shit. [Duck sighs] We keep an eye on ‘em and if they get in trouble we go help ‘em.
Duck: Yeah, there’s a part in me that feels like… If we— We can tell ‘em now, you know, tell them everything, we can keep them out of this specific thing, but it’s like the genie’s out of the proverbial bottle. Fuck, there might be genies, what do I know?
Aubrey: There probably are genies—
Duck: There probably are genies, now that I think about it.
Aubrey: But here’s my thing, is I also know that— Man, how many times do you watch a movie or TV show or something and just scream like “just tell them!” like listen, here in Kepler people are in danger all the time. And I’m starting to wonder if maybe we’re doing a disservice by not telling them what’s out there.
Ned: Start telling them stuff, then where do you stop?
Duck: Yeah.
Aubrey: Yeah!
Ned: Would you tell them about Sylvain? Would you tell them about—
Aubrey: [Crosstalk] Yeah, I know! Ned, I agree.
Griffin: Is Barclay and Mama down in the cellar with you all? They were definitely down there—
Travis: They hop down now and we catch them all up.
Griffin: I mean, they were definitely at the scene while you guys were having sort of this confrontation with the Hornets.
Justin: Yeah, I think it would be easier because I would like to ask Mama how she has…
Duck: Yeah, how have you dealt with stuff like this in the past, Mama?
Griffin: I think Mama has been pretty… just like shocked into silence since hearing that this large squadron of armed bikers knows that there’s monsters in Kepler, and seeks to do something about it. And she says,
[Pause]
Mama: Y’all there ain’t never been— there ain’t never been a situation like this before. And for once, Ned, it seems like I can’t blame this one on you. It…
Duck: Gotta be some way to blame it on Ned. Don’t give up, Mama.
[Snorting]
Griffin: She says,
Mama: I… We’ve been trying to keep the peace discreetly for decades now, and it’s been workin. Listen, I’m about to get forced into retirement, and I’ve made peace with that, but I can’t feel comfortable about the idea of looven’ just like a handful of y’all to, y’know, fight against deadly supernatural threats every two months or so. And if they have the opportunity to add some more muscle behind your efforts, I don’t see why n—
Griffin: And while she’s saying that, I think this is when Barclay just reaches up and takes off his bracelet and sets it down on the table, 12 Angry Men style. And Barclay says,
Barclay: In case you all forgot, I’m Bigfoot. So if these guys—
Travis: Oh, way to namedrop.
[Justin wheezes]
Griffin: [Chuckles] “I’m friends with Dracula.”
Travis: [Laughs] “I’m kind of a big deal, I’m in Hotel Transylvania.”
Griffin: It’s not— Yeah, don’t worry about it. He says,
Barclay: This is an armed gang of passionate monster-slayers. What do you think happens if they come up into Amnesty Lodge and figures out our whole situation here. Do you think that they’re gonna be as patient as you guys are?
Aubrey: But that’s my point! Is if we can edu— If we have a chance to say “this is what’s up” before that happens… I mean, what do you think is the better option? We don’t tell them and one of them accidentally catches sight of somebody changing, y’know, their watch and turns into another goatman or whatever. And they get attacked while they’re just getting ready for a swim. Is that really better than us telling them ahead like “some people are good, and some people are bad just like on earth. With humans.”
Duck: I feel like I know some of these rowdy boys their entire lives, and I— we can tell them it’s too dangerous, but if we let them know that there are literally monsters in the town, there’s nothing that’s gonna dissuade them from, y’know, continuing to search them out and probably getting themselves killed, honestly. I mean, they say that they’ll— I think what we’re really talking about here, y’all, is, do we save them from this one or do we save them from all the future ones. ‘Cause I feel like if we can stave them out of this one, but they’re gonna be back in full force next time.
Mama: I don’t see why we need to keep debating, if they find out about the gate to Sylvain that’s it. That’s war. That’s the war.
Aubrey: We have a resource here that we’re not using.
Mama: Which is?
Aubrey: Jake Cool-Ice, he knows them. He was with them. He can give us insight… I think we need to bring him into this discussion, because for all we know, forgivin’ that scene, which we have to remember [Duck sighs] it wasn’t too long ago that two of their friends got mangled by a monster while they all watched. I think it’s understandable that they’re a little on edge. We might be able to get some insight from Jake about this whole scenario.
Mama: Alright, listen, listen, listen. We burned plenty of daylight debating this. I’ll talk to Jake and see if I can get him to try and make peace, I guess, with the Hornets. Try and impress upon them the reality of this situation without sort of clueing ‘em into everything, Barclay. But we need to get out there, because whatever is out there killin’ folks right now ain’t gonna wait for us to have a summit with the local biker… tuffs. So, I think let’s get out there right now, before nighttime rolls up and see what we can find out.
Aubrey: I think at this point, if I may, Duck and Ned, it kinda feels like we have… let me check my notes.
Travis: And she mimes opening up a notebook.
Aubrey: Ah yeah, we don’t know anything. So maybe we should split up and just kinda see what we can find out by asking around?
Duck: Well, let’s not split up. But let’s do ask around. I like the part where we ask around, for sure.
Ned: Yeah, and I miss you, guys.
Duck: Yeah, I miss you when we’re not together. And honestly? Can I be straight with you guys? Uhm… I’m just a dude.
Aubrey: Oh, that’s right. Okay.
Duck: [Crosstalk] I would rather stay with the people with superpowers. If that’s like all okay by y’all.
Mama: Well, that’s just— Yours talkin’ about Aubrey, she’s the only one— I guess Barclay.
Duck: Okay, you know, I didn’t wanna be shitty.
Aubrey: [Crosstalk] Ned has a gun.
Duck: [Laughing] He has a cool gun and a lot of lying power.
Aubrey: Yeah and a car! Which—
Duck: He used to have a car. [Laughing]
Aubrey: He could get another car.
Duck: He got a crêpe-wagon. [Pronounced: Crayp]
Aubrey: He did get a crêpe-wagon. [Pronounced: Crayp]
Ned: [Simultaneously] I got a crêpe-wagon. Crêpe-wagon [pronounced: crap], crêpe-wagon.
Aubrey: Crap-wagon! Crrrap-wagon.
Duck: [Mumbling] Still not— I’m not doing it again.
Ned: Crap-wagon [with a harsh “cr”]
Aubrey: Crap-wagon [with a harsh “cr”]. Okay. Well, before we go out and look, I need to go use the restroom, ‘cause I haven’t in like 45 episodes.
[Laughter]
Justin: And all of us just realized they haven’t shit in a year. They all go to shit.
{Ad break 23:21 - 28:39}
Travis: We hear a flush and a handwash, and like footsteps coming back down the stairs. [Imitating sound of walking downstairs] Dup dup dup dup.
Griffin: Okay. Sure.
Aubrey: Okay, I’m ready to go!
Griffin: Fantastic. I don’t really-- So, it’s kinda up to y’all how you wanna do this investigation. I think that this is more how Monster of the Week is designed to be played? Which is maybe not the most sort of show-friendly process? But I think it would be interesting to just let y’all loose in Kepler, which is a lot easier now, because we have this map in Roll20, and we have an ongoing list of leads and stuff like that. So it’s up to y’all. We can just do scenes as you wanna do ‘em, and you tell me what you wanna look into. Because as you've said, you don’t know jack about this thing.
Travis: Well, it seems to me like even if we don’t know anything. Over the last couple episodes we have made some contacts. I mean like, there’s Indrid. [Justin: Indrid’s gone.] I will say from Aubrey’s point of view, the things that she learned from investigating the scene makes her wanna talk to Dani. But I don’t know that that’s something she’d wanna do in front of everyone.
Griffin: Well, you can do, you just go talk to Dani alone. I know we wanted to do scenes together, but if that's how you want to talk to Dani, that's how you want to talk to Dani. On the subject of Indrid, we might want to clear this up. Last time you guys saw Indrid, Duck punched Indrid in the face, and knocked his glasses off, and then Indrid flew away as the Mothman. And you actually haven't seen Indrid since. That was a couple months ago, during the last hunt. So Indrid is not super available as a resource right now.
Clint: I think we need to investigate why this happened. I think we need to investigate, I mean, we're not getting anywhere necessarily with the creature, but I think we need to figure out why. Why that particular place, why the Hornet's Nest, what led to that... I think that's the angle we need to pursue. Because there's obviously the, we said it ourselves, this was a targeted attack that happened at the Hornet's Nest. I assume there's still some injured Hornets in like, the hospital and stuff? [crosstalk] Would there not be?
Griffin: Um... I don't know about that. There's definitely some in the morgue still, like...
Clint: Let's get it clarified, are there... were there survivors?
Griffin: There were. I think that they have mostly been discharged at this point.
Clint: It'd be nice and creepy. [Travis: It would be! Yeah!] We haven't been to a morgue. We haven't been to a morgue since... [Justin: Yeah, let's...] two arcs ago...
Justin: Let's go to the morgue. I'd love to see how we're going to get into the morgue.
Travis: Let's go to the morgue-y zone.
Griffin: So wait, do we want to do, uh, Aubrey, you go talk to Dani, and... Ned and Duck to the morgue?
Clint: If I may have a vote, I say let him go talk to Dani, we'll take care of something else, and then I think we all ought to go to the morgue. Is that all right with you, Juice?
Justin: Yup.
Griffin: Okay, let's do this conversation with Dani. When... you're trying to find like a time to talk to her where she is not, sort of, around anybody else, and you get a great opportunity to do so because I think it can be just like later that day that the Hornets showed up, you find Dani and she is just kind of walking around in the clearing in the woods, where the archway is. And she's just, she's actually like got a hand up on it, and she is just kind of like, standing there with her eyes closed, and in fact I don't think she notices when you sort of walk up.
Travis: And of course Aubrey's out taking Dr. Bonkers out for a walk.
Griffin: Okay. That's the first time I've ever heard you leave off one of his names.
Travis: Oh, sorry! Dr. Harris Bonkers. Thank you. Thank you, Griffin.
Griffin: PhD? It's been so long.
Travis: Yeah, Dr. Harris Bonkers, PhD.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: You know, how you take rabbits for walks?
Griffin: Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
Travis: Or for... hops? And, and she...
Aubrey: Hey, Dani! Ahem! Ah-heh-hem!
Griffin: Dani is not startled, I think, by your approach. And she turns around and looks at you, and she looks... she does not look, sort of, the usual sort of chill... you're not getting those usual chill vibes that you get from Dani when she's just kind of kicking it around Amnesty Lodge. She is definitely upset about something. And she says,
Dani: Hey, Aubrey. Sorry. I... sorry. What's up?
Aubrey: Well... I need to talk to you, but first, is everything okay?
Dani: Not really? I mean, the, the-- I was, I guess I'm homesick, a little bit, I, uh... I've still got, I've still got family over in Sylvain that, you know, I'm not allowed to go over and see, and it's... you know, I'm grateful for Mama putting us up and giving us a safe place to stay, but it's, it's, you know, it's hard... I'm... I miss them a lot.
Aubrey: I totally understand, and... we can talk... let's make plans to hang out later and unpack that, and I want to be here for you, but... I need to talk to you, and it's incredibly urgent. Um...
Griffin: She is, she's actually distracted as you're saying this, like, she's... she actually kind of turns away from you and is looking back at the gate, and I don't even think she responds to what you're saying. She is very, very sort of engrossed.
Aubrey: Dani, you might be in some serious shit very shortly. There was an attack at the Hornet's Nest, where that biker gang hangs out, and the attacker-- the description is very much like you, um, and I know it's not you, because you wouldn't do it, and I'm not saying it was you. I'm saying, I need you to tell me where you were, and if you know-- are there any other, you know, Sylvainians around like you, blond women...?
Griffin: This is definitely Investigate.
Travis: Okay. All right.
Griffin: Let's keep the streak alive. Those big-boy rolls. What's your Sharp though? Travis has rolled a 6. What's the Sharp--
Travis: Plus one. That does give a mixed success.
Griffin: All right, on a mixed success for Investigate, you hold one. So you get to ask one question. You're asking where she was-- you're trying to get an alibi, right? So it's not...
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: I guess this could be Investigate A Mystery if you were trying to weed out that she is not the monster, right? So I guess we could, I guess the rules still apply here. I'm willing to let just, you know, 'Where were you last night?' be the question here. [crosstalk] If that makes--
Travis: Okay, cool, then let's go with that.
Griffin: She says,
Dani: I don't remember, Aubrey. I cannot remember where I was last night, because I wasn't, sort of, aware of it. I, I--
Griffin: And now that her breath is, like, quickening, you can tell she's getting kind of scared? She says,
Dani: I was taking a walk down toward Mt. Kepler, next thing I know, it's, it's morning, and I wake up here, in front of the arch, and I was... I was holding this?
Griffin: And she's got this little satchel with her, and she opens it up and reaches inside and she pulls out this sort of dark blue book that is, the cover of which is sort of heavily damaged, and the-- it's this hard leatherbound cover that is etched with these arcane symbols that, like, I think you know enough about magic and stuff from your lessons to know that they are magic symbols but you definitely, you can't really tell what it says. She says,
Dani: So, um, that was my morning. How was yours?
Aubrey: Well, we got threatened by a biker gang, and I got outed as using magic and fighting monsters. So also not great. Now that you mention it, cool. So... I, on my end, am going to figure out what happened, and make sure you don't get in trouble, and do everything in my power-- which is a lot, 'cause I can do magic and throw fire and stuff-- to make everything okay. Um, I need you to just kind of lay low and, uh, for fuck's sake, if you see a biker, run.
Griffin: Dani smiles when you say that, I think she appreciates the concern, and she says,
Dani: I'm not scared of them, Aubrey. I'm not-- I'm not afraid of what they'll do to me. I'm scared of what they might find out. I'm scared of war between our worlds. And frankly, I'm scared of this.
Griffin: And she points at the book. She says,
Dani: I'm going to hide out, of course, I'm going to lay low, but I need you to get out there and find out what this is.
Travis: Griffin, real quick. I'd like to Read A Bad Situation.
Griffin: Oh, okay.
Travis: In regards to the book.
Griffin: All right.
Travis: Let me... okay, cool, a 10.
Griffin: All right.
Travis: So, one, I want to ask, are there any dangers we haven't noticed, and I want to couple that with my Third Eye. The Third Eye that lets me, you know, kind of examine magical shit. [Griffin: Yeah. Okay.] Look for magic. I want to kind of do those simultaneously with the book.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, I mean, it pops off. As you sort of--
Travis: 'Cause I'm expecting some, like, Tom Riddle shit.
Griffin: Oh, no, nothing quite that, sort of, inherently obviously evil. You open up the book and just kind of like thumb through it quickly, and you know, clap on your Third Eye, which also reads, and it makes like a gross noise as it moves back and forth to read. Is it a physical eye? Have we...
Travis: No. No! It's not a physical eye!
Griffin: Anything's possible!
Travis: I mean, that's true, Duck is wearing a sword belt, so...
Griffin: It is, I think the, in terms of it being a danger, I think the thing that you, I think the thing that you pick up on is, there are incredibly powerful magic spells in this book. It is a guidebook for how to cast extremely advanced, extremely potent magic. And I think that that's how you could interpret it as a danger. I think with your Third Eye, like, you're able to tell that there's like, one passage here that is sort of the most complicated and most powerful spell of them all, and again, you can't make out what the symbols say, just because like, you're not that advanced in it yet, but there is sort of an image, and the image you can clearly tell is sort of a crude drawing of a mountain and there appears to be-- there's something coming out of the mountain, there's like... smoke, or fog, or something coming out of the mountain. Not necessarily like a volcano, but just like it's emitting this smoke in all directions. That is what you pick up on.
Travis: And I want to use one more of the Hold Three, and that's just, while I still have that ol' Third Eye open: what's the best way to protect the victims? I want to just kind of like, look over Dani, and see if there's any, like, weird aura, or weird energy, or any kind of thing like that. Am I seeing around her, any kind-- I'm worried that she was like possessed, or something?
Griffin: Oh, I see, I see, I see. There is, you can, you're picking up on traces of some sort of energy thing. Like, that's about as specific as you can pick up on.
Travis: So there definitely was something there, but it doesn't appear to still be present?
Griffin: I don't know if you can tell the latter thing, but there definitely was something there.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: And let's call the scene there, and get to the morgue.
Travis: And just real quick, I did tell Duck and Ned about the book, but I said I found it by the gate whilst taking Dr. Harris Bonkers PhD on a walk.
Griffin: Love it, love it, lovin' it. Okay, so the, the morgue, huh? The morgue is sort of in a building adjacent to the sheriff's department, not so, like, close to the front door that like you're going to walk in front of Sheriff Owens directly as you try to get into the morgue, which, I think you were right in your assumption that it may be kind of tricky to get in there. This is obviously not a super big town, so the morgue is a fairly small and humble building, there is a sort of entry chamber as you walk inside with a big heavy door towards the back that is where, sort of, the morgue business is taken care of. And then there's a small, just like, Ikea desk in front of it, with some notes and stuff on it. And as you walk in, there is a man sitting at that desk, and he is wearing a white lab coat, and he is just sort of reading some stuff on his desk. He actually has a brochure out for the Green Bank Telescope, and he is reading it, sort of, with, I mean he just doesn't even notice that you guys come in as he is reading this brochure. And you all are in the morgue.
Travis: We walk past him? [Griffin: (laughs) Uh...] That's what I thought you were implying! ""You're in!""
Griffin: No, the door is big, and-- the door into the morgue is big, and it has actually, you see a keycard lock next to it.
Clint: I got us this far.
Travis: What did you do?!
Clint: Well, I had the idea, Travis! I said, go to-- I did drive us, by the way, we stopped at Cryptonomica so I could get the Cryptonomica van, and pick up something else.
Griffin: Okay, that's ominous, I'm very scared of what that could be. At this point, now that you all have walked into the morgue and remained silent for eight straight minutes, the morgue technician looks up at you, and he says,
Morgue Technician: Can I help y'all with something?
Duck: Well, we would like to see the bodies of--
Aubrey: My brother!
Duck: My dad.
Ned: My son.
Duck: His brother. Her-- His-- His son, her brother, my dad.
Aubrey: Not related. There's two of 'em.
Ned: But you have to figure out which two.
Duck: We need to see a body for a dare. I'm sorry about all the lies from before but we need to see a body for a dare.
Aubrey: I was dared to look at the body of my brother.
Ned: And my son.
Aubrey: I was dared to look at the body of his son. Who is also my brother. [Justin: Everybody can't be--!] Because he is my father.
Justin: Everybody's bit can't be that they're bad at lying! I put my, like, I staked my claim in that, you fuckin' stooges! [crosstalk]
Travis: I thought mine was a good lie, of like, I'm here to identify my brother, I'm here with an officer of some kind, and this is my elderly caretaker who watches over me because our parents are deceased. It was going to be a good lie, and then Ned had to throw in, and you, my father, or son or whatever--
Clint: Griffin, what is-- I assume he has a nametag on, right? An official nametag?
Griffin: He does. It says--
Justin: Careful. Don't force Griffin to create a character if he's not ready to do it. He'll get very snippy.
Clint: Just a name! Just a name!
Griffin: Greg-- Gregor.
Justin: See?
Clint: Gregor?
Griffin: Gregor.
Clint: Greg-or. Very distinctive name.
Griffin: No, Gregor! (Pronounced more like ""Gregger"") Gregor, Gregor.
Ned: Okay, I remember on the InterNed, there's a-- there is a-- one of the handles is Gregor Mortis. You-- aren't you a fan of Saturday Night Dead?
Travis: God damn, Dad, Gregor Mortis is a great username.
Justin: It's such a good pull, Dad. What-- what is the move, Griffin, where you're-- not just trying to investigate someone or manipulate them, but try to-- impose a reality--
Griffin: No, this is fucking great! Let's do it! Shape this shit, man, I love it, you're on some-- it's some Infinity War shit, you just snapped and Gregor existed. So this is-- ""net friends"" is your role here--
Clint: Eleven! [Various: Wow!]
Griffin: That's an eleven plus charm.
Clint: Plus charm, which is plus one, so that's 12.
Griffin: Okay. Gregor, Gregor Mortis looks up at you and I think it actually takes them a second to actually kind of figure out what you're talking about, and then Gregor says,
Gregor: Oh! Oh man, oh my God, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that it was-- that it was you, Ned! So wait, you need to get in there and-- and see bodies?
Ned: Well, we're doing a little research for an upcoming episode, the uh, the Night of the Living Dead, and we wanted to look at a not-living dead person. Um, so-- if could spare us just a few moments in there while we do a little research for Saturday Night Dead, Gregor--
Aubrey: I'm supposed to build some, like, you know, mannequin bodies for the set, and so I just need reference just to see... I've never seen a dead body before, you know?
Duck: (quiet) And none of us have the internet.
Aubrey: I don't want that on my search history, are you kidding me? Oh, what if my parents saw! [Justin: Thank you. That's good.]
Gregor: Yeah, I can, um-- I can let you in. I really don't want Sheriff Owens to find out about this--
Ned: No, no no no no no, believe me.
Aubrey: We don't either!
Ned: He's not a friend of the show.
Gregor: No, I-- listen, there's not a back door out of there for y'all to sneak through, it's really just this one. So be quick, I guess, and-- yeah, this-- this is a weird request, Ned, but... anything for the webmaster.
Ned: And here, wait wait, I have one of these enamel pins...
Travis: Where are you pulling it from?!
Ned: My face... um... and, uh...
Travis: No no no, it's of your face, you were pulling it from--
Griffin: You didn't just rip it--
Ned: True, yes, an enamel pin of my face.
Travis: I misunderstood.
Ned: But in this, this, my friend Gregor, is for you.
Travis: Now who would be so vain as to make an enamel pin of their own face?
Griffin: Yeah. Unbelievable. Gregor lights up and pushes it through his badge, which takes some effort, but with his super strength he does it--
Travis: Whoa!
Griffin: He walks over and swipes his badge across the keypad, and he says,
Gregor: Seriously, like maybe five minutes? And then let's get you out of here?
Aubrey: You've got it.
Griffin: Okay. You all walk into the morgue room, and in an effort to kind of keep you concealed, he shuts the door behind you. So there are two bodies covered in sheets on, sort of, two metal racks, one of which has been clearly sort of worked on recently. There are a few-- what are those things that like, you can slide bodies in and out of in morgues in TV shows and movies?
Clint: Slabs!
Griffin: The slabs. Yeah. That's probably the best name for it. There's definitely a few of those in the room. Also, like, just like Gregor explained, there's no other sort of entry or exit from the room. And that's where you are.
Travis: Aubrey spooks Duck.
Aubrey: Boo! Did it work? Did I get him?
Duck: This is all profoundly disturbing. Let's just try to keep some sense of decorum in here, eh?
Justin: Okay, I'm going to pull back one of the sheets, at random.
Griffin: Okay, you pull back one of the sheets, and underneath it is a dead guy. [Justin laughs loudly] And I think just like you were told by Detective Megan back at the Hornet's Nest, it's a sort of, it's a grisly thing that's happened to them. There are bite marks, but not really bite marks, right, it's-- it doesn't appear to be like in a vampire movie where there's two sort of cute little discreet fang marks, like, it's a bite mark like a, more akin to like, a small shark got in there, and yeah, I think that's all. That's what is obviously apparent about this thing... this thing, this former-- this former human Kepler, Keplerian, without rolling.
Aubrey: So should we... say a few words?
Duck: I mean, I don't think people who sneak into morgue have been called on to-- I don't think so!
Aubrey: It feels like-- I don't want to just start-- [crosstalk]
Ned: Here are a few words: gross. Gnarly.
Duck: Yeah.
Aubrey: Yeah, but it's still a person!
Ned: Look at the stitchwork on the-- oh, God, why do they open them up like that?
Duck: This poor bastard's been taken back to Chicago something fierce. [crosstalk]
Aubrey: He's bought an apartment there, like, long lease... hey, Ned, are you grossed out like, by the wounds, or by the shoddy work of the undertaker or whatever the fuck?
Justin: Whatever you're trying to establish.
Ned: Well, no, but look how-- No, I'm sorry, as an artist, I find this very disturbing.
Aubrey: Okay, you sound like a serial killer.
Travis: Griffin, I would like to look at the wounds, I guess?
Griffin: Okay, I mean, this is just Investigate a Mystery, I think, if you're wanting to--
Travis: Plus Sharp? [Griffin: Yes.] So it's a 7. It was a 6 plus 1.
Griffin: Okay, so you get to ask one question from the list, looking...
Travis: What happened here?!
Griffin: I'm trying to think of how to give you sort of more details than what you got just from eyewitnesses. Looking at this thing-- how about this, there's definitely like, on this, on this rack, there is a clipboard hanging from it, with a coroner's report. And I think between just sort of looking at the victim and looking at the coroner's report, you can tell that they did die from blood loss. But there's nothing mentioned in the report about, like-- there's no blood. There's no-- [crosstalk]
Travis: There's nothing like 'drained' like one might be afraid of with a 'vampyr.'
Griffin: Yeah. They weren't made into a Capri Sun. They were just kind of... they were just kind of-- they were just maimed, in sort of the gnarliest way possible, it seems like.
Aubrey: Doesn't it-- let me ask you fellas a question. Doesn't this seem almost calculated to be scary? Like, you'd think if it was a monster trying to feed, right, that they had time to attack multiple, like more than just two, and then walk away-- like, this is a lot of attack. Like, one of these wounds would probably have killed this guy.
Duck: Yeah. It seems like overkill.
Aubrey: It doesn't just seem like a rampage because they stopped and left.
Ned: There's got to be a reason why this attack happened.
Aubrey: You know, in the past when we've seen like these attacks, it seemed almost like, you know, if you let a bear loose somewhere, you know what I mean? But this isn't like the kind of attacks we saw with like, the water thing, or the, like, abomination thing...
Ned: All right, hear-- hear me out. I have a wild and crazy idea. You know the item I stopped at Cryptonomica and picked up?
Griffin: This is going to be so good.
Ned: Okay, you, Duck, are basically wearing a-- a magic belt, a magic weapon belt.
Duck: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.
Ned: Aubrey is seething with magic correct? Aubrey, seething?
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Ew? Gross? But yes.
Ned: And in, under my jacket, I've got a gun with a fucking magic crystal in it, right?
Duck: Sure, magic artifacts. Magic is real.
Ned: So we got magic all over the place.
Duck: Ooh, magic for days.
Ned: I picked up an item at the Cryptonomica that I stole from Theresa Caputo's house. That I think--
Travis?: Who?
Ned: Theresa Caputo. She's the Long Island Medium.
Aubrey and Duck: Okay...?
Ned: With all of this magic and all of this power--
Clint: And I pull out an Ouija board.
Duck: Okay...
Ned: Why don't we ask the dead guys?
Justin: I just...
Griffin: I tell you what would be fun. I tell you what would be fun, is if I make Ned do a Use Magic roll. If I make Ned do a Use Magic roll to do this thing that he has suggested. And that's not to say that if you roll a fucking 14 like you do sometimes, Clint McElroy, that I will then make one of the bodies sit up and start tap dancing. But if you want anything to come out of this, I feel like you're going to have to roll to use magic.
Clint: Okay. I'm willing to try it.
Griffin: I'm willing to try it too. Because we're having fun here.
Travis: I'm definitely willing to watch him try it.
Justin: Yeah, I'm willing to stand ten feet away and...
Clint: Now remember how a Ouija board works, no no no no no, everybody has to put their fingers on the-- the plinth (sic; it's actually called a planchette) [crosstalk] and it spells stuff out. Nobody's going to sit up, there's--
Griffin: And there's not a table to-- there's not like a service-- [crosstalk]
Clint: Just set it on top of the guy! Set it on top of the guy!
Griffin: Yeah, you just put it on the other guy who's still covered up.
Clint: Yeah!
Justin: Okay. So wait. I just want to clarify the sequence of events. We came to the morgue to look for clues--
Griffin: [laughing] On a field trip-- on a dare--
Justin: We pulled back the sheet of one person, looked at it, and it was like: well, confirmed, folks, the facts are here, this body's done been fucked up. And then my dad pretends-- my pretend dad in the game-- pulls out a Ouija board and is like, I'll contact 'em! And now I'm like, but there's a whole other body, you don't want to look real quick? ""Hey, I said I brought a Ouija board!"" [crosstalk]
Travis: ""What part of 'I brought a Ouija board' don't you understand?""
Justin: But does it-- do we have to be in close proximity to the-- ""I've got a magic gun!"" I know!
Travis: I've got a magnifying glass and I've got a microscope and I've got a Ouija board!
Justin: I think we should put this to a vote. For all the listeners. They get to say if what they-- [heavy crosstalk and laughing] [Travis: The first ever call-in poll.] It should be one of those, like, two different 800 numbers. Except make 'em 900 numbers so we profit, something.
Travis: All right, so Dad, roll... [Justin: laughs loudly] ...a 6. Now...
Griffin: What's your-- now, Dad rolled a 6, plus Weird.
Clint: Plus Weird. Which is a zero.
Griffin: So that's a failure on Use Magic, which means I--
Clint: 6? 6 is a failure?
Travis: Yeah! We've been playing for months! [crosstalk]
Griffin: We've playing this game for a long time, yeah. Here is what happens. You all are doing this... this, uh, pseudo-seance on top of this, the other body that is--
Ned: OH SPIRITS IN ATTENDANCE, THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE CROSSED OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE, SPEAK! SPEAK TO YOUR HUMBLE SERVANTS! PLEASE! I BEG OF THEE!
Griffin: As you are doing that, I think you are sort of getting a little bit too into it, and you push down too hard on the board trying to get some sort of response, and it just sort of falls and clatters to the ground. And as it does so, you now can see under where the board was, there is some blood sort of soaking into the sheet.
Travis: We... pull the sheet back...?
Griffin: As you pull the sheet back, you can now see the individual underneath it. It is a man who is sort of similarly torn up in the way that the other body was, however, this is a-- a fresh one. And you can tell just, you know, by visually comparing the two. And I think you're so, sort of, struck by the, again, like, grievousness of these wounds, that you-- it actually takes you a little bit longer to look at the face of this person, and when you do, you see the face of Gregor, the technician you were talking to outside. And as you notice that, the door into the morgue starts to swing open.

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Sheriff Owens: If there’s anything you know, anything that sounds beyond belief, I am all ears, Ned Chicane.
Ned: Sheriff, I’m not sure what I can tell you, because I’m kinda clueless.
Beven: It’s like this blonde lady, about Tim-sized, I would say. I saw her again, but this time, like… she was way different.
Griffin: Gregor Mortis looks up at you, you all walk into the morgue room… there are bite marks, more akin to, like, a small shark got in there.
Aubrey: Doesn’t this seem almost calculated to be scary?
Duck: It seems like overkill.
Ned: There’s got to be a reason why this attack happened.
Griffin: As you pull the sheet back, you can now see the face of Gregor, the technician you were talking to outside. As you notice that, the door into the morgue starts to swing open.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Justin: ...And the door was opening… and a lot of spooky business was afoot!
Griffin: Errrr! That’s the sound of the door.
Travis: Welcome to our Halloween episode!
Griffin: Yeah, what if we just did all sound effects for this one? So it goes like this: Errrrr! [Travis gasps dramatically] Hmmmmm.
Justin: I’m taking off my headphones, I don’t want to hear this.
Clint: Aaaaaaah!
Griffin: Get outta there! [explosion sounds]
[laughter]
Justin: Wait, stop, Griffin. Not a sound effect.
[Griffin continues to make explosion sounds]
Travis: No, Justin, that was the sound of a radio playing and somebody on the radio was saying “Get outta there!”
[Griffin makes a ka-chunk sound repeatedly]
Clint: Splurt!
Griffin: Ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunk. I’m a bunch of bones!
Justin: Y’know, it’s good because you do the Previously On, and that ramps the tension back up, [Griffin: Yeah.] and then it’s like, “Hold on. Let’s deflate that real quick.”
Griffin: Well, this is like we’re DJs giving ‘em a taste before the drop, and here comes the drop: [dramatically] a monster comes through.
Travis: Oh no—wait. A bad monster?
Griffin: Yes. You are all more or less trapped in this room, as the one and only entrance into the morgue proper here slowly swings open from the front office, and a figure passes through that door. And there is something kind of familiar about the figure that comes through the door… it is a humanoid shape. It is a humanoid shape, albeit with four arms, and this shape is just made out of this tangible, brilliant light. Its head, or what you’re assuming its head is based on where heads traditionally live, sort of cranes around to take you all in and ascertain the situation. And you’re having some trouble actually, like, seeing what this light-person is doing because the other thing that actually makes them different from the other beings like this you’ve seen before, is this one has this swirling cloud of particles going all around them. I say particles—they are visible to the naked eye. They are just these small orbs of different—
Travis: Like a nebula?
Griffin: Uhh, kinda? You could describe it like that. There are different orbs of different shapes and sizes, behaving in different ways; some are, like, gelling together and shooting new particles off, and some are just neatly orbiting around each other, and some are just ping-ponging around in this cloud—
Travis: Oh, like a lava lamp.
Griffin: Some of it is lava lamp-esque, but some of it is also just, like, maraca beans? And you don’t usually see them, but what they would be doing. It is chaotic and it is this cloud that’s just surrounding them and kind of mimicking its movements as this light figure moves, just cascading all around them almost like armor or something like that. And this figure walks into the room and then reaches its arm backward with, like, shocking force, with shocking speed, and slams the door of the morgue shut. And with that, I’m gonna ask you: who wants to go first?
Clint: Ned!
Griffin: Alright, Ned.
Clint: Ned grabs a scalpel off of one of the nearby examining trays.
Griffin: Okay?
Clint: ...And holds it to the throat of the corpse of Gregor Mortis and says to the creature:
Ned: Stand down or I’ll kill your twin brother!
Travis: Nice.
Justin: Nice.
Griffin: Okay, that’s one way to-- [crosstalk]
Justin: I’m saying hey-- I’m saying nice in the world of the Adventure Zone. As Duck Newton. [Griffin laughs] It’s hard to get the accent across [Griffin: Yeah, sure.] with just one word. But all he’s saying is: Nice.
Travis: Nice.
Griffin: Um, I guess-- okay so this seems like a move...[crosstalk] This seems like a...
Justin: Like a bad idea? [Travis laughs]
Griffin: A “Manipulate Someone”.
Clint: Yeah! Manipulate.
Griffin: I’m trying to remember, monsters-- [Clint bursts out laughing.]
Justin: Fuck off. [Clint continues cackling.]
Justin: Dad rolled a twelve.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Twelve and I also add one, so that’s a hard thirteen. [emphasizes] Thirteen. [continues laughing]
Griffin: Okay. The rules state that monsters and minions cannot normally be manipulated. But I think “normally” is the word I’m going to use as flexible-- a launch pad for this great improv that you’re doing here.
Clint: Well then allow me to point out that, according to those same rules, for “manipulate someone” on a 12+, you absolutely convince them. [smug]
Griffin: So… okay here’s how I’m going to sort of-- [crosstalk]
Clint: That surprised you; that really surprised you, didn’t it? That I knew the rules.
Griffin: No, I think-- [crosstalk]
Clint: [proudly] I looked at the rules!
Griffin: I’m very proud of you. I think the way that this thing responds to it, and maybe this will, like, give you information, because-- well here’s one thing that you learn: it’s not this thing’s twin and this is not a gambit that is, like-- means anything to this being. At all. But, when you mention it being its twin, you see the cloud take shape. And it, like, these particles wrap themselves around the light arms of this being -- it sort of folds two of them back into a torso that’s started to form, like a fleshy torso. And then two other arms spring out, and now, you know, it just looks like a guy. The particles continue and it goes up and it forms a skull and a system of musculature and skin and hair and clothes, and now, the thing standing before you is Gregor. Again. He holds up his hand and you see some of his, like, skin move off of his forearm. Not like it’s peeling off, but just like it’s sliding down-- it’s redistributing itself. And this stick made of just dude particles that he is now holding, and then with a flash, they turn into metal and now he’s the one holding the scalpel. [pause] You are still holding your scalpel, but he has...mimicked it, and created a mimic scalpel that he, uh, is armed.
Griffin: So that’s a lot of intel. That’s what you get for that roll I think.
Justin: You manipulated them successfully into thinking -- you absolutely convinced him that you think it was his twin brother. [laughs] He was completely convinced of your belief-- [crosstalk]
Travis: He believes that you believe-- [crosstalk]
Clint: Yeah! Take that.
Travis: He is impressed by your level of commitment to the bit.
Griffin: Sure…
[laughter]
Griffin: I think with that, this new Gregor has begun to walk towards you, Ned, because you are the one who was sort of initiating the confrontation with him.
Justin (as Duck?): Gregor, thank god you’re here. I have terrible news. Your twin brother has been killed. [everyone laughs] Hey, you may want to set the scalpel down, pal. This is some tough news you’re dealing with.
Travis: Aubrey is going to try something new here.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: It’s an aspect of “Use Magic” that is to… ‘bar a place or portal to a specific person or type of creature’.
Griffin: Okaaaay…
Travis: So as its walking towards Ned, Aubrey says,
Aubrey: “I would like it to stop, please.”
Travis: And calls to magic to kinda stop it from getting to Ned.
Griffin: Hmm, okay.
Travis: And roll is a nine plus [Griffin: Plus weird.] three. Twelve.
Griffin: Okay. With that, that counts as a success; it pops off without issues. You choose your effect. I’m going to… we’re gonna have to decide what the effect is together because you can’t just be like “he’s imprisoned in an impervious crystal”, you know. I don’t think that that is something that Aubrey has proven that she can do, but also like, it’s sort of God-mode, which I don’t know--
Travis: I would say the effect I will use, ‘cuz I’ve used it before, is like force or wind.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: So more of like, I would say that… as it moves forward, the ‘equal and opposite reaction’ thing kicks in. And the wind is pushing it away from Ned.
Griffin: Okay, I think also it pushes Ned backwards as well, not in any sort of harmful way, [Travis: Yeah.] but just sort of towards the back corner of the room, sort of putting these things in two opposite sides of the ring.
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: I’m sorry, I’m getting some sort of like, pop-up constantly asking me to look for a mp3 file and I don’t know what it is. [clicking noises] Okay.
Travis: [in robotic monotone] Griffin, would you like to look for ‘Space Jam soundtrack’?
Griffin: [chuckles] Yeah I dunno. Duck, what are you doing? It sounded like you were just gonna do what Ned did.
Justin: Uhhhh…
Griffin: Unless that was one of your classic jokes.
Justin: No, I-- when you help someone out, is that something you do on your turn? Or, how does that work? Is it something you do in the moment then forgo your turn in doing so?
Griffin: Usually Help Out is a reactionary thing, but it can also be a setup. For sure, like it’s-- if you tell me what you’re thinking about doing…
Justin: I don’t really have anything to help. My plan was to try to help if anyone had a good thing that needed some help. But like, that situation has not transpired as of yet.
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: But I don’t have a lot that I can do. In this situation, I’d probably be like, hiding... [laughs]
Griffin: Okay, yeah that’s totally an option-- [crosstalk]
Justin: Or, kinda staying to the periphery…
Griffin: Yeah, I mean, another thing you can do, you are face-to-face with the monster and obviously that’s a dangerous place to be, but also an informative place to be, and that’s the name of the game. You guys have to know shit about this monster to be able to eventually kill it. So like, you could do something like that, or if you just wanna hide, that’s absolutely up to you.
Justin: I tell you what, I’ll-- I’m gonna hide under the-- while the attention is drawn to my compatriots, I want to hide under the table, like the operating table-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] And tie his shoelaces together.
Justin: [mimicking springing sound] boiiiing!
Griffin: Love it. [laughter]
Justin: The prank man strikes again. [Clint laughs.] No, uh, I’m gonna do that and just kinda observe. I have, you know, some zoological training; I have stuff like that. What can I pick up about it, I guess is what I want to find out.
Travis: Is that ‘Read a Bad Situation’? [crosstalk]
Justin: It’s either that or-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: So yeah-- [crosstalk]
Justin: It’s ‘Read a Bad Situation’, right? I mean, technically?
Griffin: I mean, here’s what I’ll give you. You’re trying to do two things, right? The ‘hide’ is a move, and the ‘figure shit out about it’ is a move, so I feel like this is, if anything, it’s an ‘Act Under Pressure’ and then if you pull it off, not only will you have hidden, I’ll give you one question. [Justin: Seems fair.] Just sort of meld the two together. And that also give me more to do if you fail because ‘Act Under Pressure’ mixed success has some great shit in it.
Justin: [rolling] And that would be... [Griffin: Cool?] one, so a seven.
Griffin: Alright, that gets you up to a mixed success. You are going to get under this table, right? I have to give you a worse outcome, hard choice or price to pay. The hard choice is, there’s two tables, right? There were two operating tables there. You can either jump under the one that is closer to the corner that he was just knocked into and have a less stealthy place, like a not great, perfect hiding place. Or you can jump under the one that is further from where he is, but you won’t be able to get as much hard info on it. So that’s your hard choice. Two tables. It’s about as good a world binary as we can get.
Justin: I’m gonna get close. I’m okay with that.
Griffin: Okay. Alright, ask your question then.
Travis: What does it sound like when doves cry? [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] It’s ‘Read a Bad Situation’, so…
Griffin: I think it could be either, so you tell me. Are you trying to figure out how to get out of this morgue without dying? Or are you trying to figure out like what this thing’s weakness is?
Justin: Nah, I’m not gonna leave. How ‘bout this? ‘What kind of creature is it?’ That’s what I’ll go with.
Griffin: Okay. I think that you are close enough to see, like, the exact-- like the incredible detail of this figure, right? You can see the shoelaces on this thing’s-- [crosstalk]
Travis: You can tie them together. [chuckles]
Griffin: You can tie ‘em together if you really want to. You can tell-- you can see the weight of a wallet in its back pocket, right? This thing just formed itself out of this cloud, which is gone now. The cloud has become the suit that this thing is inside. And when you have that thought, I think it clicks for you that this light creature, that I think you all have seen at various points whenever you defeat the abominations, has turned this cloud of particles into a suit, that they can, you know, you know that they can turn it into Gregor. What else can they turn into?
Travis: Like a Gregor suit?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: So you said wallet, is it basically mimicking-- does Gregor look like somebody who just came into work? Are they looking like Gregor would have looked-- [Griffin: Yes.] while working at the morgue? Basically?
Griffin: Mmhmm, yes.
Justin: So it’s working off something it has seen.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Aubrey, I think-- or Ned, actually I think Ned is up. You’re on the opposite corner of this thing. Duck has just jumped and hidden under a table. This thing-- [crosstalk]
Clint: Is it not-- has it taken a turn?
Griffin: Um, that’s not really how this works. I respond to what you guys do. I mean, if you guys go a long time without getting out of the room or fighting this thing, or whatever, like, yeah, he’s gonna start taking swings. But really, my role as Keeper is to respond to the decisions that you all make and give you hard choices. For instance, Duck is now, like, Duck is not very well hidden from this thing, and he’s very close to it. And this thing is standing in front of the only door out of here, which is shut behind it.
Clint: But it hasn’t done anything aggressive yet, right?
Griffin: It was approaching you with a scalpel, which its still holding.
Clint: Well, I’m holding a scalpel too. [Justin scoffs.]
Griffin: Well, we can have ourselves a good old-fashioned scalpel fight…
[Travis laughs]
Clint: Okay, I’ll tell you what.
Travis: [sarcastically] No, not again!
Clint: Here’s what Ned does. He extends his arm, and drops the scalpel.
Griffin: Okay. What are you trying to do with that?
Clint: Well I wanna see how closely its mimicking everything we do.
Travis: Maybe it’s responding to the body language, like threatening body language of Ned?
Clint: I mean, well-- [crosstalk]
Justin: Hey listen, he dropped the scalpel, Griffin. What happened next? [laughter] What happened next in the story? Ned dropped a scalpel-- [crosstalk]
Travis: He doesn’t have to tell you what he’s trying to do; you just have to tell us what you’re gonna do.
Justin: Yeah, what happened?
Griffin: Um, yeah let’s make it interesting. This thing-- [crosstalk]
Justin: Well there’s a first! [laughs]
Griffin: Well I was trying to think if we should try to make it into a roll. But okay fine, the being reaches out its arm and lets go of its scalpel, which falls to the floor. As it does, you can actually see, Duck, from your position, as it hits the floor, it just effortlessly turns into these silvery spheres that sort of float around for a minute before getting sucked up and reconstituted into the fake Gregor’s form. And as he does that, I think he starts approaching just with his hands outstretched, and now he is coming for you Ned, and he’s coming to hurt you.
Aubrey: Hey, could you not hurt Ned? Maybe? Like maybe we could talk? It seems like maybe you want… something?
Griffin: Okay, its arms transform as they reach out towards you, and it is a kind of-- it’s a disgusting transformation, [Travis: Got it.] because all of this organic matter making this thing up just shifts around in ways that human bodies shouldn’t be able to shift. Their upper arm grows twice in length and their hands bloom outward and reform into these long bestial clawed hands, and he nearly doubles in height, and now, standing before you is this hideous, tall, hairy creature, that is just like covered in sores and just has this ghoulish, dripping, animal smile and its feet are enormous and I think like your brain tries to like, quickly say ‘Okay, what is this thing, Ned? What is this thing?’ It is- what you maybe would have considered before you met the real deal, is, it’s bigfoot.
Travis: It’s a sasquatch? A woodland ape?
Griffin: And, yes, and uh, it grabs you, Ned, and chucks ya. It throws you against... just backwards, into one of the operating tables and you and the - not the one that Duck is hiding under - but you and the body go, sort of, tumbling over and you take one harm.
Travis: Okay, Aubrey throws Snitch at it.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Is that Act Under, or, Kick Some Ass?
Griffin: That's definitely Kick Some Ass.
Travis: Okay, it's gonna end up being a seven.
Griffin: Oh, you have a minus one Tough.
Travis: Yes I do.
Griffin: Okay, I mean that's still a mixed success, so where are you trying to like, hit it. What are you trying to, uh-
Travis: Well, I figured just, I'm going for like, back, between the shoulder blades, you know?
Griffin: Okay, yeah, it had its back turned to you as it picked up your friend and chucked him. Okay, what was the damage on that?
Travis: That’s a good question, Griffin. So, in gear options for spellslinger there is a one harm knife.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And I figure I don’t have any pluses to the damage, it’s the magic flying part that is the bonus, right?
Griffin: [surprised] Oh, it’s a magic weapon.
Travis: Yeah, Snitch.
Griffin: Oh, okay, okay, here’s what happens. I think one arm is- this is great. You throw your magic knife and this bigfoot creature screams. And not like in a bestial way, it’s not like you just stabbed it into a bear, the scream is much smaller than that. It’s much, actually, higher pitch than that and honestly, it sounds almost vocoder-y? Like it sounds… Not Hatsune Miku, but you know, sort of along those lines. It is not the sound that you expected to come out of this thing. And you don’t get like, blood out of this creature, you just see the particles where the knife was just sort of, burst outwards and it gives the bigfoot now time to reach back and pull the knife out of its back and drop it to the ground.
Travis: And I-
Aubrey: Snitch, back!
Travis: Cause it's a magic flying knife.
Griffin: It zips back into your hand!
Aubrey: Thank you Snitch, you're great.
Griffin: It, in exchange, Aubrey, turns around with one of its massive clawed arms and just grabs you by the face and just slams you backwards into the wall of racks, and you take two harm.
Travis: Well, I’ve got a vest, so I only take one harm.
Griffin: Yeah, the vest is thick enough. [crosstalk]
Justin: Yeah the back wall of racks is coated in roast beef grease and…
Travis: Curly fry sauce.
[laughter]
Justin: Gross… Is that- that’s probably a re- [Clint: Can’t believe they have-] that’s probably a regional thing, huh? Okay- [Griffin: Really narrowcasting] Google Rax Roast Beef sandwich restaurant, only one exists.
Travis: Really good chocolate shake with bits in it.
Justin: Great chocolate shake!
Travis: Oh, and it had the chocolate, actual like, chunks in it, so it would stop up the straw? Ugh!
Griffin: Yeah, it was really gross. [singsong voice] Duuck!
Travis: Now-
Justin: Yeah, I got this.
Travis: Just to clarify, because one of the tags on Snitch is Volatile. Aubrey is very complimentary and thankful to Snitch so that it doesn’t get upset. That’s what I’ve determined ‘Volatile’ means in regards to the magic flying knife.
Griffin: Oh, no, I think what it means is as it’s flying backwards it does a weird curveball arc back in your direction and when you catch it, like you’re-- every time, I want it to be every time Aubrey catches this thing she’s scared shitless, because [Travis: Yeah.] it’s a knife flying at her in a fun, new pattern. It’s a new way every time.
Griffin: Duck. What’s up? You gonna just keep chilling?
Justin: Here’s what I’m gonna do. I’m going to-- it’s right by me, yay?
Griffin: It’s right by you, yeah, and its attention is definitely at your back, it just slammed Aubrey up against the wall, [Justin: Perfect.] and threw Duck into a ta-- er, threw Ned into a table.
Justin: I'm gonna, uh, I wanna pull out Beacon.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And I'm gonna extend Beacon and whip it around its legs.
Griffin: Okay…
Justin: I’m perfectly angled to do that.
Travis: Now, Justin, I have a question, based on something we learned last episode. Every time Duck draws Beacon, is he at risk of his pants falling down?
Justin: Uh, no, Duck also always has suspenders.
Travis: [chuckles] Oh, okay!
[Clint laughs]
Justin: Think about this, Travis. Think about what you’re saying. Really.
Clint: That’s canon!
Justin: Forest suspenders! He’s worn them since he was a teenager. [crosstalk]
Griffin: I almost think this would be an Act Under Pressure, right? I don’t think-- there’s something like this in ‘Kick Some Ass’, but you’re clearly not trying to attack this thing, and from your position I don’t know that it would attack you either, so I think it’s just an ‘Act Under Pressure’ roll to try and bind this thing’s feet so that you all can have some time to do whatever, so [Justin: Alright!] roll ‘Act Under Pressure’.
Justin: Let’s do it! [rolls] Fuck
Griffin: Plus Cool!
Justin: Plus Cool, which is… one. That’s a six. Which is a failure.
Griffin: That’s a six, which is not good. Okay, so what happens--
Justin: I’m gonna burn a Luck!
Griffin: Are you?
Clint: Oooh!
Justin: I am! I wanna burn a point of luck, cause I really need this to work, ‘cuz I want to get the fuck out of here.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Okay! Uh, then yes, go ahead and mark that Luck point off and you succeed in binding this thing’s feet. And instantly-- at this point I think Duck [crosstalk]
Justin: Wait, that was dumb, it’s made of light! Aw, fuck!
Griffin: [chuckles] Instantly Duck and Aubrey, you all are back on your feet you all have recovered cause you don't wanna be lying on the ground while this thing's on the loose, and you see Duck pull this gambit. It's not-- I mean it's not made of light in the sense that you're thinking, Duck, but you can tell that like, it tries to take a step forward and stumbles and falls to the remaining upright operating table. I think it's just the one that you are under and--
Duck: Sorry I guess that was a little bit trippy.
Griffin: Alright!
Travis: Aaa!
Griffin: And you see it's sort of, flesh start to shift around the blade, trying to figure out a way to get out of this thing. And yeah, I think, Ned, you’re up.
Justin: I’m very clearly-- I yell to them, like:
Duck: Let’s get the hell out of here!
Justin: Like, I think we go. I don’t think we know enough to fight this thing. I feel like we've picked up some info, I'm good to go.
Ned: Okay!
Clint: And Ned runs for the door!
Griffin: It is locked by the same keypad, uh, swipe-pad lock that you saw outside that I guess you have now realized fake Gregor used to let you into. The bigfoot that is still trying to get out of this blade binding. You actually can see that coming out of its flesh toward the back of its body is that key card that he used to let you inside. Almost as if this thing had it in its possession and when it reformed it just kinda got caught up-- caught up in the bod. So you see the key card out of here and it’s coming from inside the back of the creature.
Travis: Grab it.
Clint: Okay, Ned, being an accomplished thief, reaches towards this scary horrible monster’s big hairy ass and grabs the key card, and swipes it!
Travis: Out of its ass.
Justin: Eugh!
Clint: I know, I know, I know!
Aubrey: It’s in its ass, Ned, get it!
Ned: [shudders] Um, okay.
Clint: And-
Aubrey: Reach in that ass, Ned!
Griffin: Just so-- just so we’re clear, this thing is bent over an operating table, so we could not sort of put together a better proctological exam tableaux.
Aubrey: Reach into its ass, Ned, hurry!
Ned: Uum--
Duck: Get in there, bud.
Ned: Alright.
Aubrey: Get in that ass!
Ned: Cough, monster, cough!
Clint: And--
Aubrey: Get that ass, Ned!
Clint: Grab that a-- grab that key card-- ass-- key card and… and holds it gingerly with a thumb and a finger with a horrible expression on his face.
Griffin: Okay, roll to ‘Act Under Pressure’.
Justin: [snorts] The greatest roll--
Travis: Roll to get in that ass!
Justin: Roll to get in the ass. Roll to get a slice of that monster butt.
Travis: [laughs] Come on!
Justin: Come on…
Clint: Ssseven! Plus… one, which is Cool, and that’s eight.
Justin: It’s very cool! Very cool.
[laughter]
Travis: That’s a mixed ass success.
Justin: Climbing into a monster’s ass to get the card to get back into the place we’re escaping from, I think it’s super cool.
Clint: This is gonna be an R episode, isn’t it. This one’s rated R.
Griffin: I’m going to give you a hard choice, Ned.
Justin: Didn’t he just make a hard choice? [Griffin laughs] A pretty hard choice!
Griffin: I don’t think that-- No, I think that was undeniable. You can get the card out, Ned, and get it to your accomplices, but the monster is going to get a chance to do something to you before-- after, I guess, that happens. That’s the hard choice: there will be payback for this.
Clint: Okay. Ned, after he grabs the key card, looks at Aubrey and just is full of guilt over what he knows he did in the past, so Ned will take that. He’ll take that choice to let the-- Aubrey and Duck get away and take whatever happens to him, happens to him.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Just to paint the other side of it, like: Ned looks with whatever facial expression is full of guilt and Aubrey’s just like, uuum, okay?
Aubrey: Ned, are you-- oh! Thanks for the key card!
Griffin: Yeah, you throw the key card across the room to Aubrey and just as you do so, this thing just sort of melts around Beacon. Its feet, where its feet were, just turn instantly into this cloud of particles and you see the light form sort of effortlessly step out of the binding, and then the particles move back forward and their feet reform, and it happens so quickly that this thing just reflexively kicks backwards which sort of moves the operating table that Duck is under and sends it sliding towards the exit to the room, and it also propels it forward into you, Ned, as it turns on its heels and just charges right into you. Aubrey and Duck, what you see, as this thing pushes into Ned, it almost looks like they were fighting in front of a backdrop for a play, like a paper backdrop, that had been painted in the shape of this morgue, because they just puncture through your vision. They just puncture through whatever you can see and a tear forms in, just-- reality, in front of you. And through it, behind it, whatever’s beyond it, it seems like a very dark sort of space, but you only get a flash of a second to look at it, because as soon as that happens this thing pushes Ned through the rift and follows behind and then the rift disappears.
Aubrey: Well… Shit!
{Ad break 29:46-33:55}
Griffin: Aubrey and Duck, you have just watched your third get pushed through a rift in space-time by a shapeshifting monster. You are in the morgue by yourselves now but you have the key needed to get out of it.
Justin: My sword is on the ground?
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Alright, I pick that up.
Griffin: Good.
Justin: That’s great.
Griffin: That was a trick that I was gonna do on you, if you’d left it there. I was looking forward to making you not have a sword anymore.
Justin: Nice try, Gamemaster. Or should I say, fart-lord.
[laughter]
Duck: Well, uh, that didn’t go, I mean that didn’t go exactly as I expected, eh?
Aubrey: Yeah… yeah.
Travis: Aubrey’s like, you know, feeling the wall, like they do in movies when somebody gets pulled through a wall.
Griffin: Yeah it wasn’t even in the wall. It was just like, the center of the room. It wasn’t like he smashed through the wall Kool-Aid Man style. He smashed through, like… light. Kool-Aid Man style.
Justin: [laughing] You know, how Kool-Aid Man does.
Travis: [laughing] Yeah. Imagine if Kool-Aid Man were a being of pure light, you know like Crystal Light.
[Clint laughs in the background.]
Travis: Thank you dad.
Griffin: That’s a good joke. That’s, that’s just good joke right there.
Travis: Thank you!
Clint: Good jokery.
Justin: That’s a good joke.
Duck: So uh… what do you think we should do now? I mean, we gotta get Ned back, eventually.
Aubrey: Uh-huh.
Clint: [chuckles] Eventually.
Duck: There’s no question-- hey you’re not here.
Clint: Oh right, sorry.
Duck: There’s no question about that. [pause] There aren’t many questions about the fact that we have to eventually, uh, secure Ned. But what the fuck was that thing?
Aubrey: Well, mimic?
Duck: [contemplatively] Mimic. Maybe. Yeah, it seemed like it could copy people-- hey, right now, quick. Listen, I seen a lot of TV and movies. Tell me something that only you know, but that you would tell me and that I would know. Or like, a secret code word maybe? Something like, so we can’t get mimicked. You know what I mean? People never think about that shit.
Aubrey: People never think about getting mimicked?
Duck: Naw but just like, in a movie where there’s mimics, people never think about like, we need a secret mimic catchphrase or codeword or something to defend against the possibility of mimic attacks. [Aubrey: Well, um.] So like, what’s gonna be our secret mimic thing?
Aubrey: Last week you were telling me about that time that you shit your pants when you were in high school, that you never told anyone about?
Duck: Fuck it, listen Aubrey, I told everybody that story. Honestly, I have shit my pants pretty regularly. And honestly, if you look at me, just sorta how I carry myself as a person, that would be a good educated guess. I think anybody could crack that.
Aubrey: You told me about the time you shit yourself at the DMV?
Duck: That’s true…
Griffin: As you’re having this conversation, you all hear a beep from the door lock on the other side of the wall and hear a shifting of the lock in the door, which--
Travis: Aubrey jumps to one side of the door, with her back against the wall.
Griffin: Yeah, it swings open and in enters Sheriff Owens with his service revolver drawn and out.
Duck: I’ve never shit my pants anywhere, Sheriff! [laughter]
Griffin: He turns his gun towards you and like, freaks out. He notices you too, Aubrey, and he says,
Sheriff Owens: Both you, don’t move, don’t go anywhere. What the fuck are you doing in here?
Griffin: You also see like, through the door out into the head office-- you see Deputy Dewey, and he’s watching the front door of the entire building. Just sorta getting that down on lock. And Sheriff Owens is interviewing the two of you at gunpoint.
Duck: Uh, hey Sheriff, put that away. I’m an officer as well. We’re brothers in-- behind the badge. Badge bros.
Sheriff Owens: [exasperated] That doesn’t-- Look around-- What did you fucking do in here?
Griffin: The morgue is, by the way, a mess. Imagine you are the chief operator of the Sheriff’s department that this morgue is responsible for. You walk in and there’s bodies on the floor, and just a big messy fight obviously happened in here.
Aubrey: Listen, Sheriff. It’s time I came clean with you, and told you the truth. [dramatic pause] I’m a federal agent. [Griffin: Aw man.] I’m here investigating, well, I can’t tell you. My partner, Agent Stern, and I have been working together up at Amnesty Lodge-- that’s where we’ve been holed up. Doing some research, and there’s been some strange disappearances around town over the last couple years. People have come through from out of state, and because they cross state lines, it makes it a federal case. So we’ve been working together to try to clear that up, and we heard there were some mysterious deaths down at the Hornet’s Nest, so I came down here with the help of local forest ranger Duck Newton [Duck: Oh thank Christ] to help me investigate into the situation.
Duck: Yep. [Griffin laughs hysterically]
Griffin: Did you say “oh thank Christ” because you were worried you were gonna have to come up with your own cover story?
Duck: I’m local forest ranger Duck Newton, and that’s it. [laughs]
Aubrey: He knows nothing-- he’s just been helping me. This is the first he’s been hearing about this. [crosstalk]
Duck: Hey listen-- The literal first I’m hearing of this. I’ve never heard any of this before. At all. This is the first I’ve heard of it, Sheriff. Damn.
Griffin: Yeah. ‘Manipulate Someone’ I think here, Aub.
Travis: [groans slightly] It’s an eight. Seven plus one, an eight.
Griffin: Yeah there’s not gonna be any salvaging that. They’re going to do it, but they need you to do something right now to show them that you mean it.
Aubrey: Let me call my partner. Let me get to that phone there on the desk and I’ll let you talk to Agent Stern.
Sheriff Owens: Alright, just hold on.
Griffin: He pulls out his flashlight, that he’s now kinda holding under his revolver, and he shines it around the room. And he sees the body of Gregor on the floor, that is like, obviously not a body that was in here before. He has just realized that Gregor has been killed. He says:
Sheriff Owens: [sternly] You all are gonna wait, behind the desk, in that office there. [calls loudly] Dewey?
Griffin: Dewey turns around. He says:
Sheriff Owens: Dewey, keep an eye on them. Either of them makes a sideways move-- well, don’t shoot at ‘em, unless you think they’re gonna get you, in which case you’re gonna need to do it. But just yell my name if a sideways move happens.
Deputy Dewey: You got it.
Griffin: He’s still sorta standing in the doorway to this building, but he’s got his back to the street, and he is now looking at the two of you all behind the desk as Sheriff Owens moves into the back of the morgue to get some context for what happened back there.
Travis: So Griffin, are we gonna have to kill Dewey?
Griffin: [deadpan] You’re gonna have to kill Dewey. No, I think he just wants you all to-- I think the calling Agent Stern thing is sort of what he is moving you toward. You’re gonna have to actually do something if you want to get out of consequences for this, but in the meantime he has, you know, he’s not pointing his gun at you anymore. That’s kind of a success.
Duck: Dewey?
Deputy Dewey: Yeah?
1
Duck: Listen, that thing that was here? It could come back at any second. And we don’t know what caused all this mess, but it wasn’t us, and whatever it was, it’s the same thing that wrecked shop over at the Hornet’s place. We have got to get out of here now. All of us, ‘cuz we don’t know when it could come back, or what’s gonna happen next. Whoever those were that caused all this.
Aubrey: What Duck is saying is absolutely correct. We came down here, no one was at the desk, we heard a noise in the morgue, we went to look and the door slammed behind us.
Deputy Dewey: Now you two listen to me. I know you all think, just ‘dumb ol’ Deputy Dewey, you can get him to do anything’. You know, ‘Dewey’ll eat it’. You can tell me to do anything and I’m just a fool. But I went to school just like anybody else-- to deputy school to get this position and I’m way sharper than y’all give me credit for. Y’all are always there when this shit happens--
Duck: What’s your Sharp?
Deputy Dewey: It’s a three. [laughter]
Duck: Damn. Shit.
Deputy Dewey: That’s more than enough to know that y’all are full of shit right now. So y’all are gonna stand there right now and if you keep acting up, I’m gonna read you your rights, ‘cuz I got them memorized too.
Griffin: As he’s talking, you see a rift open up 20 feet behind him in the parking lot. You see the shadow of the bigfoot form of this monster start walking, just like, emotionless, Terminator style, walking towards Dewey from behind. He does not see it.
Duck: Dewey. Give me your gun. Now.
Deputy Dewey: What the fuck are you talking about?
Duck: Dewey, we got one chance bud, give me your gun.
Griffin: Is this one of your normie moves?
Justin: This is “Trust Me”. When you tell a normal person the truth in order to protect them from danger, roll plus charm.
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: And I already told him the truth, that we needed to leave because the thing could come back.
Griffin: Yeah sure.
[laughter, pained noises]
Justin: That’s a three. So three plus two. That’s a big um… that’s a five.
Clint: [Crosstalk] Twelve!
Travis: And I can’t help him enough, right? I can only-- [crosstalk]
Justin: Nobody can help me enough.
Griffin: Yep. He has his gun out towards the two of you, and he says,
Deputy Dewey: Now listen here, step number one in the deputy playbook is to not give your--
Griffin: And then he is… grabbed, by this figure, and pulled backwards. You hear this pained squeak come out of Dewey as this thing grabs him around the neck and carries him out of your line of sight. I think definitely, the Sheriff heard that and he starts to-- [crosstalk]
Travis: This is going to be hard to explain.
Griffin: He starts to run outside and you hear him scream. He is out of sight too; you two are now alone in this morgue.
Travis: Aubrey follows. Aubrey rushes in.
Griffin: [chuckles] Duck?
Justin: I’ll give chase, with Aubrey.
Griffin: You all, see something that I think, it’s gotta be terrifying, not in the usual way, not like in a ‘mortal fear’ way, but in a ‘the cork has just come out of the bottle’ and that’s gonna be tough because you see Sheriff Owens trembling, but holding his service revolver, trying to maintain some semblance of bravery as he points his gun at this bigfoot, who grabs Dewey around the torso, and just spins him and flings him through the large glass windows leading into the Sheriff’s department. Everybody inside there-- there’s a couple other officers, there’s a receptionist-- everybody in there sees Dewey get flung into the room, badly bloodied at this point. They also see the bigfoot standing in their parking lot. Immediately, Sheriff Owens opens fire, and wings the bigfoot a couple times. It just gets down on all fours, like a jungle cat, and rushes away, onto the main street and starts running east out of town. Immediately, just like without even-- I think he’s now stuck his courage to the sticking point-- and Sheriff Owens runs and jumps in a squad car, kicks the siren on, and takes off in hot pursuit.
Travis: So he’s got that covered. Aubrey goes to check on Dewey.
Justin: I’m gonna grab onto the back of the Sheriff’s car.
Griffin: Oh fuck.
Justin: On my skateboard-- I’m skitching.
Griffin: [excitedly] Oh yes! Yes! Yes! Okay, yeah, okay. I’m gonna give you advantage on this roll, which we’ve never done before.
Justin: [grumbles] I don’t need to fucking roll, I’m just skitching. Human skitching.
Griffin: Well it’s for sure an ‘Act Under Pressure’, but because you’re using an object that is perfectly made for this, and because God has smiled down on our session and allowed this moment to happen, roll 3d6 and we’ll take the higher two.
[rolls, Clint cheers]
Griffin: Yep, a four and six is ten, that’ll get you there. [Clint cackles.] You do this thing perfectly. How long has it been since you skitched?
Justin: Three weeks.
[Everyone laughs.]
Justin: Duck’s a complicated man. There’s lots of times, when we’re not hunting monsters, and sometimes he’ll just get a good fucking skitch going.
Clint: Now I know what it is, but for other people who may not know what skitching is-- [crosstalk]
Travis: It’s skateboard hitching dude, haven’t you seen Back to the Future?
Justin: Yeah, I actually think that maybe he has practiced-- this it’s s gonna sound stupid, but I feel like he might have practiced this move with Leo. Like maybe part of his training to get his balance back and stuff like that.
Griffin: [amused] I love it. It’s so fucking good. Okay, and Aubrey, you’re just running in to help Dewey, is that what you were doing?
Travis: Yeah, so she’s used healing before on Keith, [Griffin: Right.] so first I think she’s just checking to make sure he’s alive.
Griffin: Okay so we’ll do that scene in a second. I want to jump cut to Ned real quick.
Ned, you are having trouble telling if you’re conscious or not? You can’t really tell if you are dreaming or not? You’re trending towards the latter because for one thing you can’t feel your body right now and you are standing in a clearly, like, virtual space. You are in just this huge empty void with this like, this grid of circuitry covering the floor and every few seconds there’s this circle of light that just sort of pings off of where you’re standing and it spreads and at certain points where it intersects the grid your circles of light that are coming out, you see your memories. You see really-- you see familiar things. You see a vision of your third grade teacher dismissing a class to recess, you see-- [crosstalk]
Clint: Mrs. DiAngelo?! Oooh.
Griffin: Mrs. DiAngelo’s class, you see the layout of like, your parents’ bedroom and the house you grew up in and it’s various things that, you know, almost all of them are inconsequential, and then you start seeing these little bits of data that are actually way more sensitive? And I think one of those, like the one that sort of, takes your breath away a little bit is the night of the robbery. And as you see it and are confronted with it, it does what all the other memories are doing; it kinda flashes and turns into these streaks of light that shoot upward and out to somewhere you cannot see. And so you’re standing there, watching, unable to move as these memories get more and more personal. You see the basement of Amnesty Lodge, you see its inhabitants both in their disguise and true forms and you feel your pulse quickening which is like the only thing that you can feel right now. And then something appears that looks like, different from how these memories are represented. You see a panel, like this blue square, this illuminated panel that pops up immediately in front of you and there’s a flashing white vertical bar on it and you realize that it’s a text cursor, and then slowly it types out a word. It types out: “Pizza.” Then, “Duck.” And then, “Run.” And as that happens you feel this electric shock at your neck and as soon as that happens the virtual space is just gone, it was being projected on this just like, this dome of light that as you regain your senses you realize was coming out of this thing that you had wrapped around your neck that has been short-circuited or something has sort of released you from that, whatever that virtual state is. And now you are just sort of standing in a room that is completely pitch black and you don’t really know where you are. What do you do?
Clint: Summon up a light cycle.
Griffin: Well- you’re not in the v-space anymore.
[Justin laughing]
Clint: Okay, I thought we were in full Tron mode there. Um, okay. Would Ned have a cell phone?
Griffin: I mean you’d have to give me some reason for a person to own a cell phone without being able to use cell service--
Travis: Maybe it’s an iPod touch.
Griffin: I’ll give you an iPod, I think an iPod makes sense.
Clint: Wait, wait! Or a Zune?
Justin: A Zune, a Zune.
Griffin: It’s a Zune, thank you, thank you.
Travis: Does a Zune have a flashlight on it?
Clint: No but it has an illuminated screen. [crosstalk]
Griffin: No but it’s got an illuminated screen, yeah, sure. Okay, what is the background? What’s your Zune background looking like?
Clint: It’s an aquarium thing. It’s like, you know, little seahorses.
Griffin: [Laughing] Is it stock? Is it stock that it came with?
Clint: Yeah, oh yeah.
Griffin: [amused] Love it, love it.
Clint: Ned can’t afford that.
Griffin: Yeah you can tell you’re just like in some sort of a small supply closet. There’s some cleaning supplies, there’s cobwebs like all over and you can also tell, like, looking at the ceiling that you’re under a set of stairs, it’s like a Harry Potter bedroom closet and that is where you are, and there is a door out of here that is closed.
Clint: I would say Ned would probably open the door.
Griffin: Okay, yeah! It opens just fine, it was not locked.
Clint: And doesn’t step through. Opens the door…
Griffin: You’re slicing the pie.
Clint: And just kinda peers around the corner.
Justin: [crosstalk] That’s a pie slice folks.
Travis: Slicing pie.
Griffin: Let’s start out by Reading A Bad Situation.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: Because that’s what you’re doing, right? You’re looking out the door trying to get some info.
Clint: Right. Okay, that’s a fi-- a four. Plus…
Travis: You can’t see shit.
Justin: The rolls today...
Clint: Plus two, which is a six, which is still a failure.
Justin: Yowza, yowza, yowza.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Mark an experience.
Travis: You see your own death.
Griffin: [chuckling] You see-- yeah. Okay, failed roll, I get to make a hard move. Here’s what you get for free, you can see--
Clint: Well I mark an experience point first, right?
Griffin: You do mark experience, well done. I’ll tell you what you see, right? You’re not gonna get anything more sort of insightful than that but I’ll tell you what you see. So, you are in, um, the door of this closet opens up into what appears to be the decrepit lobby of some sort of hotel or something. It is very, very dark all over here. The windows, the door, the exit up from this building have all been like, completely boarded up, so any light you’re getting is coming from the gaps in the panels, but you can see a few details: immediately in front of you is a reception desk and you can see a back door leading to some sort of office there, and then in the lobby there’s a handful of toppled-over cobweb-covered pieces of furniture. There is like a long dormant fireplace there, there are stairs immediately above you, the stairs that were on top of this closet leading to the second floor and then to your left there is a hallway at the end of which you can see is a conference room.
That is what you see. And the hard move is, there is a flash of light in the conference room and then you hear a humming. And you remember, it’s the same humming that you heard back in the morgue when the creature entered the room. It’s almost like a junction box on a summer day, how you can kinda hear the electrical wires you can hear this thing and you know that there is something in the conference room. So, what does Ned do? You have this hum that you know is the monster and it is in the conference room down the hallway, and there’s a few other areas that you could go, you know, check out or hide in or try to find an exit in. The world’s your oyster in this building that you can’t quite tell what it is.
Clint: I think Ned’s-- Ned’s natural stealth would give him the confidence to try to observe this conference room. I mean, Ned’s not sure anything on the second floor is gonna be any safer, and usually exits are on the first floor. I think Ned would sneak towards the conference room and maybe peek around the corner or try to find some way to sneak into the conference room and try to observe and find out more about this creature and where the hell he is.
Griffin: Okay, roll to ‘Investigate A Mystery’. Roll plus Sharp. You are-- I’m telling you now, you’re putting yourself in danger to do this.
Clint: I know.
Griffin: But if this is what Ned wants to do, this is what Ned wants to do.
Clint: It’s a nine, plus two, Sharp.
Griffin: An eleven. Okay so you get to ask two questions.
Clint: Alright. Um, what happened here?
Griffin: What happened here is the being has just stepped through the rift, or some being has stepped through the rift and now it is back in that light four-armed form with that cloud of particles following behind it. It has stepped through one of several rifts that are in this room. And when I say rifts, I don’t mean like, big open tunnels, you know, big open portals? Most of them are just sort of these crumpled up fissures in space time. Through a couple of them you can see certain scenes, I think you can definitely see one into the morgue which is where you just came out of, And, yeah, you see a few things. Also it’s worth pointing out, like, you have no idea how much time has passed since you were in that virtual space. I don’t want people thinking this action is necessarily happening at the same time. You see several rifts leading to different places. That is your first question; what’s your second?
Clint: What can hurt it?
Griffin: Okay, you see this thing, it doesn’t see you, and it is walking and it floats, I think, up on top of the table, just like, effortlessly. It’s not like, stuntin’, it’s just like, you know, the vertical axis has like, no bearing on this thing. And it is moving around and just kinda like, peeking through these rifts and trying to get some intel on what’s going on, and then it reaches backwards and touches its back and you see it jump with a start almost like it has touched something very very tender. And you remember that is where Aubrey stabbed it with her magical knife.
And with that, after it yelps it kind of like, shakes its head, and as it does it sees a small, small aquarium scene with very small digital seahorses swimming around in it and also sees your big bearded face and it perches itself on the edge of the table and then dives, claws first, in your direction.

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Griffin: And now standing before you is this, this hideous, tall, hairy creature. It is, what you maybe would have considered before you met the real deal, it’s Bigfoot. This thing pushes Ned through the rift and follows behind and the rift disappears. Everybody in there sees Dewey get flung into the room, badly bloodied at this point, and Sheriff Owens runs and jumps in a squad car and takes off in hot pursuit.
Justin: I’m gonna grab on the back of the sheriff’s car.
Griffin: Also you are standing in a virtual space. You feel this electric shock at your neck. You are in what appears to be in the decrepit lobby of some sort of hotel. The being has just stepped through the rift. It perches itself on the edge of the table and then dives claws first in your direction.
[The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy plays]
Justin: Damn. Glad I got that fuckin’ chunky roll outta the way.
Griffin: Yeah, get those 3’s out. Trav, you wanna get a -- Dad got his 4 out, Juice got his 3 out, do you wanna get a nasty one out?
Clint: [laughing]
Justin: Get a clunker out, Trav.
Griffin: Get a clunker out, it feels good.
Justin: Squeeze out a clunker on Roll20.
Griffin: Just cleanse the [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Oh, there is an 8!
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s not bad.
Griffin: [crosstalk] That’s pretty good, dang it. Hey, welcome to the Max Fun Drive episode!
Travis: And then a 9?
Griffin: Aw, Travis is blowing his load and we’re here to tell you about the Max Fun Drive, we’re so -- speaking of…
Justin: Blowin’ loads!
Griffin: Yeah, we’re talking about the Max Fun Drive this week! We’re so excited to be here with you joining in this wonderful communion we call podcasts --
Justin: We may sound like we’re about to finish, but we are just getting started talking about this great drive. Folks, Maximum Fun, if you don’t know, is our podcast network; it’d be weird if you didn’t know that because we talk about it a lot. Maximum Fun is our podcast network and once a year we come to you, hat in hand, and say, ‘Hey, if you could spare a few bucks a month to help keep the network going, help keep our show… s, shows plural, going, we would sure appreciate it.’ So what does that mean to you, the viewer? The listener? Uh, it means that you need to head over to maximumfun.org/donate and choose what donation level you can get on board with, be it $5, $10, uh, $25, all the way up to $200, if you’re a stone cold... superfan, I guess.
[All laughing]
Justin: Everything else I could think of was pejorative and I don’t want to say anything pejorative because, like, if you wanna do that, oh yeah!
Griffin: If you’re the CEO of Stone Cold Creamery, which is not what it’s called --
Travis: [crosstalk] But oh, if only it was!
Griffin: If you’re Stone Cold Steve Austin and you wanna support us at 200 bucks a month, go nuts! If you do support us you will first of all get the knowledge that you are helping us grow --
Justin: Directly by the way.
Griffin: Directly!
Justin: You’ll put in the shows that you listen to when you register your donation and those are the shows that get your cash.
Griffin: And it’s because of that support that we've been able to turn this into our career! It’s why we've been able to take these shows so seriously and devote so much time to them and grow in the ways that we've grown and -- not only that, you also get some pretty slick gifts as well that -- um, let’s talk about those maybe during the break in the middle -- [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Well, can I just say my favorite one that everyone gets at every level -- all kinds of bonus content -- not just the new bonus content from this year, but all bonus content going back through the Max Fun Drives and this year the bonus episode for The Adventure Zone, you'll be able to hear us play Honey Heist which is a one play -- one page RPG in which I will DM and Griffin, Dad, and Justin play bears trying to steal honey from HoneyCon.
Griffin: Very excited to record that one. Very excited to get out on that one. So we’re gonna talk more about the Max Fun Drive, right now if you feel the spirit move you its maximumfun.org/donate, and uh, let’s do the show.
Travis: You’re in a dungeon.
Griffin: You're in a big dungeon, and there's, uh, a big goblin! [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh no!
Griffin: And he has, he has a crown. You take the crown and win!
Travis: Oh okay.
Griffin: So Maximum Fun, we need the money to keep this motherfucker afloat.
Travis: Maximum Fun pays Griffin by the word.
Griffin: Uh, yes. I wanna, um, I wanna pick it up with Ned because that was sort of the thing we did not resolve at the -- well, actually there was a lot of cliffhanger-ing happening at the end of the last episode.
Justin: And some car hangering.
Griffin: And some car hangering, yes. But let’s start with Ned, um, Ned, to remind you, and I’m talking to Dad now, not Ned, uh, you are in --
Justin: [in a spooky voice] Is Ned there? [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] [spooky voice] Ned?
Justin: [crosstalk] Ned? Can we speak with Ned?
Griffin: Can we channel him?
Clint: [making a awoo-woo noise like a ghost]
Justin: [normal voice] God, what’s worse than when James Lipton does that, uh --
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: You ever see that one where-- The Simpsons-- where he’s talking to Yeardley Smith and he’s like, ‘Can we speak with Bart Simpson?’
[crosstalk, them exclaiming and laughing]
Travis: Oh, that one with The Simpsons where they're all there and I’m pretty sure it just goes one by one, like, ‘Now do Mo!’ and [crosstalk] it’s weird.
Justin: I’m sorry, I said Yeardley Smith, who’s Lisa, I meant Nancy Cartwright. I’m very sorry.
Griffin: Ned is in, uh, some sort of building. It’s kind of dark and you haven't really had time to get your surroundings. You get the impression that it’s some sort of hotel or something along those lines, just based on the fact that you kind of woke up in this place, well, you woke up in some sort of weird VR zone and then got broken out of that and now are in this, uh, sort of dilapidated hotel, you think. You stepped out into the main lobby and you heard this humming coming from down the hobby towards this conference room and you walked toward the humming and got some details on the the Abomination you all have hunting this time around, but then the Abomination saw you and is starting to come in your direction.
Clint: Well, I think Ned’s instincts would be to flee… ?
Travis: Mm-hhmm… ?
Griffin: Yes?
Clint: To run away?
Travis: That tracks, yes.
Clint: Are-- Is-- Is he anywhere near any of those-- you said there were rifts all around the room, is he near any of them?
Griffin: Right, so, you are-- you definitely have this monster between you and these-- and these rifts. There is-- there is just-- there is just no way that you would be, like, you’re in this hallway that he has moved into, there's no way you get past him without getting, getting mauled by this big, big, nasty sort of monstrous Bigfoot creature. So you get the impression that, like, if you wanna get in that room you're either gonna have to overpower this thing or, you know, lose it somehow in this building.
Clint: Uh, Ned would-- he’s not going to initiate a confrontation. I mean, Ned hasn’t become that brave.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I think he runs away; I think he runs up one of those staircases.
Griffin: Okay, yeah we can kind of Zork this out if you wanna. I have sort of a layout of this place in my mind, the-- the staircase’s back in the lobby and the kind of exits from here are the main exit of the building, which is just completely boarded up. There is a back office behind the reception desk and then there is the staircase leading upstairs. Are you just trying to run away from this thing so you could, like, break line of sight and-- ?
Clint: Yeah! I think Ned’s-- it’s just-- his flight instincts have kicked in and he’s just going to run as fast as his, his little behind can carry him.
Griffin: Why don’t you Act Under Pressure--
Travis: Wait, are you running on your butt?
[crosstalk]
Travis: Are you using your butt to run?
Clint: That’s a good point, that would not be successful. Uh, all right, let’s see. And that would be a six! Plus...
Justin: Plus… cool?
Clint: Well, it’s cool, which is one, that's a seven.
Griffin: Okay, on a seven you get a mixed success. I give you a Worst Outcome, Hard Choice, or Price to Pay. I think on this one it would be a… Price to Pay? You are able to like, slide to a halt and get up on the first landing of the stairs, but this thing is bigger than you and faster than you and it charges into you and tries to grab onto you. You do feel it get like a hand on you, but you kind of peel off as you sprint up the stairs and it continues on and like crashes into the wall, and you lose it as you run up the stairs, but as you reach the second story, you reach down and realise that you dropped the gun, the Narf Blaster.
Clint: You didn't, you didn’t do that to me! Aw...
Griffin: It’s not gone forever but it is down in the lobby somewhere. But you have gotten away from this thing and you are on the second floor. You are standing in just like this one long single hallway, and there are 5 doors sort of branching off into other rooms. Through one, you see kind of a like decrepit looking bathroom, through one you see a, like, a bedroom suite and the floor in that room is just, like, almost entirely gone. It has just been smashed through; it’s just a big hole for the most part. Through that hole, actually, you can kind of see that rear office that the door was leading into down in the lobby and the other 2, like, bedrooms on the sides of this hallway; they're in sort of similar states of disrepair, and then at the end of this hallway you can see, just from your perspective, you see this one really large bedroom suite and there is there is some sort of light shining from beyond your field of view. The monster cannot see you right now; it’s at the base of the stairs. What do you do?
Clint: I don't know if Ned would leave without the gun.
Griffin: Uh, yep, I mean…
Clint: Okay, um, Ned-- he doesn't have a choice; I gotta play true to the character. He tears ass down the hallway towards the big room with the light.
Griffin: Okay, you race forward into the largest bedroom up on this floor. Are you shutting the door behind you, is this, like, are you-- ?
Clint: Yup.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I’m shutting the door and diving under the bed.
Griffin: Okay, I like it. You shut the door and as you do so you hear the bigfoot monster reach the top of the stairs. You hear like planks of wood, like, groaning under its weight and you enter the room and you slide under the bed. You can kind of see really quickly that this room is actually very well illuminated, it's the brightest room you've been in in this dark building so far, and just like from looking around this master suite, you can tell, like, this is definitely a hotel. I think in the closet actually, you can see some, like, old slippers and bathrobes and, I mean, just the layout of this building, you are now for sure, like, this is a hotel. So at the edge of this room, the big double bed that you slid under, you see a figure lying in this bed. It is a humanoid shape that has been sort of incapacitated in a similar manner as what you were in just minutes ago, this like weird sort of virtual space, only it seems like a bit more attention and care went into their imprisonment. It’s not just like their head that is encased in light, like, their entire body is just in this cocoon of light. On the abdomen of this weird cocoon, you see some sort of like interface with moving lines and figures in some sort of language that you have never seen before in your life, and as you sort of like slide under the bed to hide, the monster’s getting closer and closer and it makes its way into the room that you're in and starts looking around. I think the roll plays here, I don't think you're-- unless you have something else you wanna do, if you're just hiding-- trying to wait this thing out--
Clint: Yeah, I think hiding is a wonderful choice; this is the Ned choice to make.
Justin: Is there a Hide Under Pressure?
[laughing]
Travis: Hide Under Bed?
Griffin: The roll that you did continues to play here; I’m not going to make you roll to hide again.
Clint: God, there's dust bunnies, ugh.
[crosstalk]
Travis: Literal, they're literal monster dust bunnies.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: Yes. You, from your perspective, I mean, obviously you can see the big, nasty-- big feet of the Bigfoot. You see this thing just sort of walking around the room, and then it stops to sort of check up on this figure that is lying on the bed immediately above you, and then it walks over to the corner of this room and you see it--
Travis: Urinate.
Griffin: [deadpan] You see it-- urinate and it’s-- cool. So funny.
[laughing]
Griffin: Justin, you still got that soundboard hooked up? ‘Cause you gotta be on the quick draw with stuff like that, where Travis brings out the heat.
Justin: I’ll be ready next time.
Griffin: Ok, you see it sort of fiddling with another piece of--
Travis: [crosstalk] Itself.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Technology-- Travis, here it comes! [rimshot sound effect] Yeah, thank you. It’s messing with some sort of, like, another piece of technology that is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It looks like these, like, glass bubbles of all these different kind of shapes and sizes, over a hundred of them, you'd estimate, and they are all attached to what looks like this, like, big bag or something? You're having a hard time telling what it is from your perspective under the bed, with the monster here in it, but he's doing something with it... Yeah, I think after a while he turns and leaves the room and you can hear him walk down the hallway looking for you in some other spot. He's gone; what do you do?
Clint: Okay, I’m gonna investigate the figure in the bed.
Griffin: Okay, this would be ...
Clint: That's a mystery, isn’t it, Investigate a Mystery?
Griffin: Oh, I think, tell me what the action is and then we’ll figure out if it’s actually a roll cause if you’re just lookin’ at this thing, then…
Clint: Yeah, I’m just gonna-- I’m gonna look at the, the weird inscription or the weird words on its abdomen. Are the words on an actual item?
Griffin: It’s, like, on this, like, uh-- imagine, like, your skin is just, like, covered in light, like, it is in the shape of a humanoid person, and the readout is in the light on the abdomen. It is, uh, a weird thing. I think Investigate a Mystery right? You do not know what this thing is, so anything you can get from this is gonna be through inference and I think that's worth rolling for.
Clint: Okay, so… Investigate a Mystery, that’s a 9 plus… Sharp… which is 2… that's an 11.
Griffin: Cool! So you can hold 2 questions, and I think this is appropriate because this is like wrapped into the mystery of what this thing is. ‘What happened here’, ‘what sort of creature is it’, ‘what can it do’, ‘what can hurt it’, ‘where did it go’, ‘what is it going to do’, ‘what is being concealed here’?
Clint: Let’s start with, ‘what is being concealed here?’
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Since there's obviously something inside this light shape.
Griffin: Okay, sure, with ‘what is being concealed here’-- I mean, the identity of this person? Or whoever it is, is being concealed. You can see on this cocoon of light, there's something being projected on the other side of it, like, the inside of it, that you can only kind of tell-- it’s almost like the same scene you saw, like your memories flashing, you see what look like little video files playing out or something like that on the other side of the screen, so you can’t, like, make out what it is, but they are flashing. Somebody is in there, and they are being sort of-- they are having their sort of memories collected? In the same way that yours were just moments ago. That is, that is what you can tell.
Clint: Okay, can I use my other question to investigate something else-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Sure!
Clint: Or does it have to be that. Okay, then I’m going to walk over to the bag with all the balls on it.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: The ball bag!
Clint: The ball bag.
[rimshot sound effect]
Clint: And what are the questions?
Griffin: Uh, ‘what happened here’, ‘what sort of creature is it’-- [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] [exaggerated voice] And what’s the deal with the ball bag?!
Griffin: What's the deal with the ball bag?
[Seinfeld bass line sound effect]
[all laughing]
Griffin: This is the worst. ‘What can hurt it’ ‘where did it go’, ‘what was it gonna do’, ‘what’s being concealed here?’
Clint: What can it do? That's the question I’m asking, what can it do?
Griffin: Um, so, this, this machine, now that you're closer to it, you kinda get a better perspective on it. The bag almost looks like a large textile… sack, like a really, really big one, almost, like, a more of a, kind of like a body bag, but with the proportions of a tent or something like that. It is, it is a big bag. And fastened to it, are these orbs. I think with this roll since you're investigating it, you can count the orbs, and there's exactly 118 of them. Inside of them are different kind of... free-floating, like, particles and these particles floating around in these orbs, they have, like, different behaviors: some sort of, like, conglomerate around each other in these perfect orbits, some meld together and split apart, some bounce around, like, sort of quickly and erratically, and that is what the machine looks like. As far as ‘what can it do?’, there's another sort of readout, similar to the one-- using, like, the similar arcane language that you saw on the person over on the bed, and you can’t read that language, but there are sort of crude images also, like, accompanying that language and right now the shape that is on it is in the shape of a human body. That is what you can tell this thing, this thing does.
Clint: You said the orbs were attached to it, right?
Griffin: Yeah, it’s almost like they are feeding into the bag, as if they are some sort of energy source or something like that, that feeds into this big bag.
Clint: Being a thief, Ned’s really gonna want to try to take one of those orbs.
Griffin: Uh, okay… Yeah. I think-- yeah, you can just do it. Tell me-- tell me what the orb looks like, that you pull off. What is the stuff, the, like, particles sort of stuff bouncing around in it look like? And you can tell me literally anything right now.
Clint: It looks like… a sea serpent.
Griffin: Okay. I mean, it's not sentient like that it, is just some sort of particles but this orb, it just like pops out fairly easily from the bag, and as it does so you actually see the readout kind of like turn red and start blinking, and it starts making actually kind of a quiet beeping noise. And you don't hear, like, the monster nearby immediately, but you get the sense this is not a great thing right now, and you could potentially be caught here if ya hang around. But you have successfully retrieved one of these orbs.
Clint: Then I think he’s gonna get the hell outta there.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: And run back-- and I say run back to the rift room. I have this image of him running out and jumping on the banister of the stairs and sliding down the banister.
Griffin: Uh, okay.
Clint: ‘Cause that would be quieter than running down the stairs.
Griffin: I get you. I’m gonna make you roll again because this is sort of a different motion, I guess. We’re kinda like playing Calvinball a little bit but--
Clint: So is this Act Under Pressure?
Griffin: This would be Act Under Pressure, you trying to scamper--
[all groaning and exclaiming]
Griffin: That is not great, that is a critical failure, what is it called? That's just a failure.
Justin: Just a loss. Get your point of experience, first off--
Griffin: Get your mark, yeah, yeah, that's a-- Uh, Dad rolled a 4 plus cool which is not gonna get him there.
Justin: We gotta start saying the number first.
Griffin: You set foot outta that big bedroom into the hallway and walk down towards the stairs and as you do just like the top stair goes [loud, long groaning noise] Grooooaaaan!
[Travis laughing]
Griffin: And just like instantly the Bigfoot is there at the base of the stairs. You also see, like, a few feet behind him sitting in the middle of the lobby is your gun. It is past him. Again, you have more exits to other rooms behind you. The monster is now standing between you and the bottom of the stairs. What do you do? [music starts playing]
Clint: [sighing] Jump.
[music transition and fade out] {21:16}
Griffin: Duck.
Duck: What’s goin’ on.
Griffin: So you’re doing some tricks. We could play this-- We could just do an audiobook version of Tony Hawk Pro Skater, if you want to tell me all the tricks that you do and we can assign point values to them. I didn’t envision there being half-pipes on the road in Kepler but maybe we can--
Justin: There’s probably like-- I probably get 50 points for avoiding Mountain Dew bottles that have been [Clint laughs] cast on the road.
Travis: Would there be just one paragraph that’s just griiiiiiind?
Griffin: Yes, Duck griiiiinds. And it’s so cool, he collects all the letters in SKATE, [Travis laughs] and he slaps the sticker up on [crosstalk] Bam Margera’s dad’s butt. [Travis laughs]
Travis: [crosstalk] He gets the band tapes.
Justin: Considering Duck’s age is, I think, just a couple years older than me, his main trick right now is not dying, [crosstalk] like don’t die.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Sure.
Griffin: We need to clear something up because we actually didn’t do it in the last Acquisition thing, you have this helmet. And it’s your skateboard helmet that gives you +1 armor. I don’t know that we’ve dealt any harm to Duck but do not forget about that, because something tells me you’re gonna need it on this one! [crosstalk] Because you are skitching on the back of the--
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Griffin: Man, fucking Scrivener changed the word ‘skitching’, it autocorrected it to ‘switching’, what a narc! [Travis laughs]
Justin: Scrivener is a narc. And I do want to make sure-- I was thinking about what would make sense for Duck to do, ‘cause Duck’s been very aware of his mortality ever since he lost his abilities. I think, when he did this, he literally forgot that he was not [crosstalk] indestructible anymore.
Clint: [crosstalk] [laughs] Indestructible?
Justin: He literally [Griffin laughs] didn’t remember. I think that it was about 90 seconds into this skitching where he remembered like, “Oh fuck, like God dammit, that’s right… shit! Fuck!”
Griffin: Okay, it is right around that moment while you are zooming around behind the sheriff’s car... Are you trying to hide, are you trying to stay out of sight?
Justin: I mean, I’m holding on to the rear bumper so I feel like my default would be-- Yeah, [laughs] you’re gonna stop, right? I mean, if you see a human skitching, you will stop.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: For prolonged periods of time.
Clint: He’s in pursuit of somebody.
[crosstalk]
Griffin: Yeah, he is chasing the Bigfoot monster.
Justin: I guess, I don’t want to have to roll to see if he notices me. I think he’s just staying down...
Griffin: Okay! You’re staying down. And... what’s the plan here? Why did you decide to do this? What was the logic, before you forgot you’re invincible?
Justin: You’re asking me why I skitched somebody? Now who’s the fucking narc.
Griffin: Okay. [Clint laughs]
Justin: Yeah, the sheriff can move faster than I can and I’m following the bigfoot. [crosstalk] With the sheriff.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay. Gotcha.
Griffin: So it’s right around when you have this realization of you’re not invincible anymore, that the sheriff whips his car around the hairpin turn where the road splits off and starts heading up to topside.
Travis: And then the sheriff pops out of the car and starts ghostriding the whip? What?
Griffin: Everybody’s stunting, it’s so hot right now. Before you hit that turn, you can actually catch a glimpse of the bigfoot, who just made the turn before the sheriff’s car and is still charging on all fours up the mountainside road. You also get the feeling that he caught a glimpse of you as well and the chase continues. The sheriff tries to keep the patrol car steady just like gunning the engines. And then you pass under the underpass, beneath the funicular tram as the road continues on. It’s dark for just a second, and then when you come out the other side, you feel the sheriff tap the brakes and slow down, hesitating for a moment. You hear him curse and then you see the bigfoot suddenly appear ten feet behind you, charging in your direction. What do you do?
Justin: Yeah, hold on a second, let me do a little physics calculation on my end here. [laughs] I’m gonna scramble up on top of the car and smack it, and tell him to drive.
[laughter]
Griffin: Uh...yeah.
Justin: And we’ll say--
Duck: Ey, ey man, fucking bigfoot’s behind you, dude, drive! Jesus Christ! Hey, I’ve been skitching this whole time, brother, I’m really sorry but you gotta fucking drive right now, dude, come on! I’m vulnerable as hell! Come on! Don’t make me fight bigfoot, I wasn’t thinking through this shit! Go! I’m not gonna fuckin’ fight bigfoot!
[lots of laughter]
Griffin: Uh, Act Under Pressure for sure. I was going to make you Manipulate the sheriff but I think the tensions are quite high right now. So Act Under Pressure.
Justin: You know what, I’m actually gonna do Trust Me: when you tell a normal person the truth in order to protect them from danger, roll plus Charm.
Griffin: Ooh okay! I like that even better.
Clint: Yup.
Justin: It’s 8 plus 2, that’s a 10.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: I love it! Your Charm increased when you became a normie, right?
Justin: It didn’t increase, I re…. I just chose a-- Charm is actually +2 for all the different ratings you could pick for the Mundane, [crosstalk] it’s always +2 Charm.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I love that, that’s so cool. Yeah, then, then, I think the sheriff taps on the brakes again. And you really have to work to keep your footing on the car. And then he sees the bigfoot about to just smash into you, and he guns it. As he does so, the bigfoot starts to lose ground on you and then he just stops, and you see him back off through another one of those rifts. And then the sheriff yells--
Sheriff Owens: What the fuck are you doing on my car Duck Newton?
Duck: Yeah I was trying-- You’re gonna ask me why I skitch? Now who’s the narc!
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: He starts to yell something else, that the wind whipping past you is so loud you have a hard time making it out. Then he slams on the gas again and you can tell, as you swing around, that the bigfoot has appeared back in front of your car. The sheriff is now chasing after it. You’re definitely up on topside now, you’re zooming past Resort Row, where all these old dilapidated resorts that shut down a while ago, when the town’s economy dried up, are. You pass the ski lodge and then just past the turnoff down towards Amnesty Lodge, the Bigfoot disappears past the treeline, and the sheriff slams on the brakes. And you definitely-- you definitely get knocked off the car at that point.
Justin: Probably at that point, yeah.
Griffin: I think your helmet protects you. You see the sheriff hastily park the car, jump out, and draw his service revolver. And he says:
Sheriff Owens: Duck Newton, I don’t know what you’re doing here-- I don’t know what-- I’m-- I’m dragooning you, Duck Newton. We’re not gonna let this thing escape. This is the closest I’ve ever been to finding out what’s going on in Kepler, and you’re gonna help me. You understand me?
Duck: [pained] Oh man… can you just give me like a second? Jesus Christ.
Griffin: He grabs you by, like, the scruff of your collar and starts picking you up.
Duck: Alright, alright, calm down, fuck. I just fell off a car, jesus.
[Clint laughs]
Duck: Let me get a pull off this asthma inhaler real quick. [takes a deep breath] Alright, alright, hold on. Nope, need another pull. [another deep breath, speaks like he’s holding his breath] Yeah, alright, so Bigfoot’s real.
[Everyone laughs]
Duck: Boy, I can’t imagine how it must be to find out this way, but Bigfoot’s real.
Griffin: He shakes his head and dips back into the car. When he comes out, he is holding this black canister, and he throws it to you. And he says:
Sheriff Owens: Now listen, my service revolver is the only weapon I got on me right now, but that there’s some industrial strength pepper spray, so uh, I don’t know if this thing’s got eyes or whatever, but we need to go now; we are losing it.
transition music begins
Griffin: And he takes off into the woods.
Duck: [deadpan] Yeah, let’s go. Fuck it man, alright. Sure, why not. [Travis laughs] If you’ve got the guts, I guess I do too. Let’s go. Let’s go fucking kill Bigfoot there.
transition music
Griffin: Aubrey, when we left you off, you were racing over towards the sheriff’s department where Deputy Dewey was just flung through the front windows of the building by the bigfoot monster. There were, just like moments ago, a few people standing in the front lobby, and now like, fearing a continued assault from this monster they just saw, all but one of them have fled. As you approach the building, you see Detective Meagan, and she is hunched over the bloodied form of Deputy Dewey. She is applying pressure to his wounds. He’s got just these great big, sort of, slashes across his torso, and she stands up and darts over behind, ah, the receptionist desk here in the sheriff’s department building, and she starts dialing for an ambulance. As she sees you come close, she yells:
Detective Meagan: Hey, hey! You! You wanna be a hero? Put some pressure on that guy’s wounds or else he’s gonna bleed out!
Aubrey: Do you wanna be a hero? Then come over here and help me.
Detective Meagan: [frustrated] I’m calling an ambulance, put some-- are you kidding me?
Travis: I’m gonna Read a Bad Situation.
Griffin: Okay. That’s the move, tell me what Aubrey is doing.
Travis: So basically I’m checking on Deputy Dewey, trying to figure out if he even has time before an ambulance would get there. How bad he looks… if he’s in danger, basically.
Griffin: Okay. There are questions that deal with that. You rolled a 9 plus sharp. What’s your sharp?
Travis: Plus sharp is plus 1 so that’s a 10.
Griffin: A 10, cool. You get to hold 3: ‘what’s my best way in’, ‘what’s my best way out’, are there any dangers we haven’t noticed’, what’s the biggest threat’, ‘what’s most vulnerable to me’, ‘what’s the best way to protect the victims’? I don’t know that you have-- Ah, you have 3 to spend here, I don’t know that you’re gonna-- I don’t know that 3 of these are relevant to you, but…
Travis: Yeah, I’m gonna go with, uh, what’s the best way to protect the victim?
Griffin: Yeah I think that’s the obvious one here. Um, an ambulance ain’t gonna make it. Dewey does not have 10 minutes to spare, like Dewey does not-- Dewey does not have time for that. He is on death’s door, at this very moment.
Travis: So he’s looking worse than Keith did when Aubrey healed him?
Griffin: Yes, this is, this is-- to use game terminology, many harm. He is past the ‘dying’ checkmark on your health bar there. He is unstable, and uh, he is looking bad.
Travis: Okay, I’m gonna do some Big Magic--
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ooh! Okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] To try and do a big ol’ heal on Dewey here
Griffin: Okay, we’ve never done this before. Let’s talk about Big Magic. ‘The Keeper may require’-- what do you, what do you want to do? You just want to heal him?
Travis: Yeah, so I’m trying to do a big heal, like instead of just healing for 1, healing for like 2 or 3.
Griffin: Um, I mean let’s not gamify that, right? Let’s not say I’m trying to heal him with my-- [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, I’m trying to stabilize him.
Griffin: Yeah okay, I like that. So, ‘the Keeper may require that you spend a lot of time researching the magic ritual’. Nah. ‘That you experiment with the spell; there will be lots of failures before you get it right’. We don’t have time for that either. You could need rear-- er, rare-- this is not fun to listen to.
Travis: The three that I think would make the most sense is either: ‘it needs multiple people’, so Meagan and Aubrey, ‘you need to use magic as part of the ritual’, so I’d have to use magic multiple times, or ‘it will have a specific side effect or danger’.
Griffin: Okay, I know what the side effect or danger is going to be, but I’m not going to tell you that. That’s one of the requirements. [Travis: Right.] I agree with you; I think you’re gonna have to use magic multiple times, and you’re gonna, like, have to tell me what that looks like. For the 2 people to help; you don’t need 2 people to help you do the ritual, cuz Detective Meagan does not know magic, but you will need her cooperation in some other form. So, that’s, that’s-- those are the terms of Big Magic--
Travis: Got it.
Griffin: And you’re gonna have to roll to do it like usual, but let’s move on with the scene. So what do you, what do you do?
Aubrey: Okay, so listen. Meagan, right?
Detective Meagan: Yeah?
Aubrey: An ambulance ain’t gonna make it. So call an ambulance if you want to, and watch our friend Dewey here bleed out while we wait. Now you come here, put pressure on this, and... I’m gonna try something a little extreme, but I’ve studied Reiki and I’m gonna heal him by manipulating energy, but I need your help to put pressure here [Griffin laughs] to give me time to use it. So you help me with the energy, okay?
Griffin: This is gonna be a big Manipulate Someone-- this is a wild, wild thing for you to trick someone into doing. [Travis: You don’t know that]
Travis: You don’t know that. [Clint laughs] It’s a seven plus one, it’s eight.
Griffin: They’ll do it, but only if you do something for them right now to show that you mean it.
Travis: I’m gonna make my hands glow.
Griffin: Yeaaah, okay. Are you gonna make them glow like-- on him?
Travis: No, just catch on fire like ‘I have power’.
Griffin: I don’t think that this would work. Like I’m trying to justify it, but I think you setting your hands on fire is not going to calm this person down. I think that you setting your hands on fire is going to-- [crosstalk]
Travis: Well I wasn’t-- I was doing it to show like, I’m not lying about having power of some sort to heal him, control over energy. This is more of like, shocking into convincing.
Justin: [sarcastic] That’s how my brain would work, I think, if someone had fire hands.
Travis: Because basically right now, we are in a power struggle where she feels-- Meagan is gonna feel like an authority figure, and I look like just some kid in a leather vest, or denim vest, or whatever. And I need to make some kind of power move that’s like “you should listen to me”.
Justin: [laughs] Beautiful tapestry you’ve painted there, Travis.
Travis: Thank you.
Justin: I dunno. A muumuu, or bike shorts, or, I don’t know somethin’. Clothes, you know?
Travis: Whatever the fuck. You know, big hair. It’s fine.
Griffin: Here’s what I will give you: she sees you set your hands on fire, and like, that’s enough weird stuff for her today, and she just faints. She just like, collapses. And you get the impression that she could have interfered with whatever you wanted to do here, but now she is more or less neutralized. That is the amount of cooperation-- [crosstalk]
Travis: I’ll take a neutral party, that’s fine, okay.
Griffin: So, yeah, now it’s just you and a, a, nearly dead Dewey.
Justin: That’s a sequel to Drop Dead Fred, Nearly Dead Dewey.
Aubrey: Alright magic, this is a big one. Uh… you and me, we’re gonna save Dewey’s life. So I need you… to help me heal him.
Griffin: What’s the physical move look like here? What are you doing?
Travis: So I would say like, with the wounds and everything, trying to close those up so there’s like a… Almost like a stitching, but with magic? To close up the wounds? And like, whatever the magical form of like, you know, a blood transfusion would be.
Griffin: [chuckles] Okay.
Travis: Gotta get some blood back into this man. So maybe the blood that spilled on the floor pulling back in.
Griffin: Shit, that’s gross. Um yeah, I mean you’ve never done anything like this before. This is so far outside your comfort zone. Ah, so go ahead and Use Magic. And this is the roll. [rolls] Oh my god.
Travis: Well, not great. It’s a 3, but I’m just gonna go ahead and do luck, ‘cuz I wanna save Dewey’s life.
Griffin: Um, I mean, I still get to add in the side effect or danger.
Travis: Absolutely, positively.
Griffin: So, how much luck do you have left? You have used a l--
Travis: Yeah, this’ll be my fourth of eight.
Justin: Dang, dude.
Travis: I’m halfway out, but listen, I know that if it was me and I had the choice, I would use one point of whatever to save somebody’s life. This is a pretty big one, so.
Griffin: Yeah. You put your hands on Dewey, and you-- it’s definitely harder than it was when-- this is probably the most exertion any spell you’ve ever cast has done.
Travis: I’m picturing like the orange in the eye kind of sparkling a little bit-- you know, like, I don’t know if that’s actually connected to magic, but in my mind it is.
Griffin: Yeah for sure.
Justin: I’m not sure Trav, how’s real magic work again?
Travis: Yeah no absolutely, and maybe the red hair dye in Aubrey’s hair gets a little brighter…
Justin: How’s the lighting? [giggles]
Travis: Really good. Really good lighting, but suddenly everything becomes a little bit like a blacklight poster.
Griffin: Actually it goes completely dark.
Travis: Oh.
Griffin: It is almost like, a trapdoor just opened on a stage beneath you and Deputy Dewey, and you are both just falling. And, your falling starts to slow down, and then you’re not moving anymore, you’re just kind of like, weightless in this void.
Template:Ad break: 39:27-43:30
Clint: You said there was a reception desk.
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: All right, so he wouldn’t be jumping all the way to the floor. He’d be jumping to the reception desk, which would be a little bit of a smaller drop.
Griffin: Uh, okay. I mean, it’s still gonna be, definitely, an Act Under Pressure. This is a big boy sort of gymnastic movement that I’m excited to see play out.
Clint: And that would be... [crosstalk] an 11!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ah, there we go! A big 11. Yeah, okay—
Clint: —plus cool, that’s a 12.
Griffin: Uh, yes! Well done. Okay yeah, you jump, sort of, over the side of the stairs as this thing is charging up towards you, and you land on the reception desk. And, I think you got enough distance from the monster that you could make a move here without being necessarily threatened. You’ve got your gun a few feet ahead of you down on the floor of the lobby. You’ve got the exit into the office immediately behind you, and you have the hallway leading down to the, um, the conference room with the rifts in it.
Clint: I picture him landing on the reception desk like Neo landing from flying. You know, with his coat all, you know, all in the air. [makes whooshing noises]
Griffin: Yeah, sunglasses just form on your face, and Laurence Fishburne gives you a big smile.
Clint: I say he makes a run for the rift room, scooping up the, the gun as he pelts past it.
Griffin: Uh, okay. I think it’s gonna be a little bit rowdier in the rift room if you try and do both of those things, but I’m not gonna make you roll again for it. Ah, yeah, you do that. You are able to sort of make an arc through the lobby and swoop down and grab your gun—
Clint: The monster’s running up the stairs, right?
Griffin: The monster has now like, pivoted and is coming back down at you. And in the time it takes you to swoop and grab your gun, I think it makes it down the stairs, but you still have a, uh, an advantage over him; you are still in front of him, and you are able to run into the conference room with it at your tail. Um. And now you’re in the conference room, you can kind of see— you see, like, half a dozen rifts, right? And you, Ned, in particular, have seen these all over, for whatever reason, like, you have been more perceptive when you’ve-- when you’ve seen them.
Through one of them you see the front office of the morgue, where— you, you know, where you just were before you were pulled out. And it is empty, you can tell. You can see a handful of oblivious sheriff's department employees just kind of poking around the morgue, like cleaning up or searching for clues or whatever. Through another rift, you see the Hornet’s Nest from like, behind a patch of trees, and you can tell this is the one that you saw when you were investigating down at the Hornet’s Nest. Um, there are a couple other ones that are kind of tightly closed, that you can’t really see where they’re pointing. One of them, through one of them, you can tell, you see a tall, barbed wire-covered fence. What the fence is protecting, you can’t really tell. And... then there is a final one that opens up into the clearing behind Amnesty Lodge, through which you can see, ah, the-- the archway. There’s also one more rift in this room that is almost completely shut, and it is like glowing the brightest of all of these. Again, you kind of only have— you see this in the flash of a second because this thing is so hot on your tail.
Clint: Does-- does Ned have access to all of them?
Griffin: Yeah, they’re sort of all around the room. You would be able to make it into any of them. I mean, the ones that are— you’ve never, like... knowingly traveled— like, this thing pulled you through a rift, so you’re not exactly sure how— you’re just kind of, I guess, hoping that it’s like a door you can run through. But yes, it appears that you would be able to get to any of them.
Clint: Okay, then I say Ned makes a run, and jumps towards the one where he can see the barbed wire, because he doesn’t want to go to the Hornet’s Nest because the Hornets are there. He doesn’t want to go to the morgue because the sheriff’s office’s there. The other one’s too bright; that’s too scary. Why not go for the one that looks the most innocuous? And he does this thing where he turns in mid-air and shoots the Narf Blaster back [crosstalk] at the monster and goes flying backwards through the rift.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Fuck yeah. Why don’t you Kick Some Ass, and we’ll see how this slo-mo John Woo dive plays out.
[audio sample played in the background]: Yuh-oh!
Griffin: Shit.
Clint: Three. It’s a three. [crosstalk] I rolled a three.
Griffin: That’s a three.
Travis: Now, how lucky do you feel, Ned?
Griffin: Are you feeling lucky, punk?
Clint: Yeah, I gotta use a Luck here. [crosstalk] I’ve got to.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay, mark experience and burn a point of Luck here—
Travis: No, you don’t get experience if you do Luck.
Griffin: Oh, you don’t? Okay, nevermind.
Travis: I don’t think so.
Griffin: Okay, yeah. Ned, describe one more time— I think this thing is on the opposite end of the room— this rift is on the opposite end of this like, conference table. So, describe the scene as you—
Clint: I say— okay, so Ned’s flying as fast as he can. I say the monster even gets close enough to grab the tail end of his scarf... and pull it off of him, and that kind of—
Travis: Aww, now it has a lovely momento.
Griffin: [chuckling] Okay.
Clint: And that, and that kind of turns Ned, so as he turns, he’s now facing the monster. He already had the Narf Blaster in his hands, so he didn’t have to draw it. He shoots it-- He shoots it with the Narf Blaster and goes flying backwards into the rift.
Griffin: What’s the damage here, on the Narf Blaster?
Clint: Two harm. Yes.
Griffin: Two harm. Yeah, you see it rip some of its, like, meat off and as it— like, you’ve got this badass beam gun now, right? Like, that was the modification you did to it? It, like, just rips off part of its just like, body, and you see it just disintegrate into these particles that go flying behind it. And it seems to, like, howl, but it’s not actually quite as bad as when Aubrey stabbed it with her flying knife. But you did some damage to it. It also, uhhh because— you get to pick one extra effect here for Kick Some Ass, so: gain the advantage, take one forward, inflict terrible harm, you suffer less harm, or you force them where you want them.
Clint: I say force them where I want them, because I don’t want them to come through the rift.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, then the beam of light pushes them backward and gives them a little bit of space. They get a claw, they claw, your like-- the back of your calf for one Harm, but that’s all that they get before you turn and blast them with this laser beam that knocks them backwards. And then you are through the rift, and, uh, they think about chasing you through it, but they seem like they stop, and then just the rift disappears. Um, and now you’re standing behind this barbed wire fence— rather, you’re probably lying prone by this barbed wire fence. And as you ah, correct yourself and look up, you realize you are inside the perimeter surrounding the Green Bank telescope.

Griffin: Duck, you and Sheriff Zeke are now, like, walking through the woods, and he’s trying to track, ah, the Bigfoot, and—
Justin: I imagine it stinks like fucking shit, right?
Griffin: I don’t think it smells very good.
Travis: Oh, you’re talking about Bigfoot and not the sheriff, right?
Justin: Nah, the sheriff’s fine. I imagine Bigfoot stinks all to hell.
Travis: What do you think the sheriff smells like?
Justin: Like a...man? [laughs] Sandalwood and old leather?
Griffin: You actually get— it smells— when you were close to it in the morgue, obviously there was a chemical smell from morgue chemicals, but it stank like sulfur. It smelled like rotten eggs. It smelled real-- You were right, it smelled real, real bad. I think you’re mostly tracking it through, you know, it’s giant footprints in the snow all around you. And perplexingly, they will go for a distance and then just stop and then reappear a dozen yards away, um, and, so trying to track it is kinda tough. And you get the sense that it could be anywhere, so you and the sheriff are watching each other’s back as you go through the woods. And he says,
Sheriff Owens: So y-you fought this thing back in the morgue? What do I need to know?
Duck: Um, it’s...I don’t understand it any better than you do, man. Um, it is, uh, dangerous. It is...uh, big— you saw that, saw it’s big. We shouldn’t be fighting it. There’s one, there’s a good one for you. This is a mistake. If you wanna bounce, like, I’m-- I am with you. Me and you taking this thing on together? Not smart. Not smart at all. I’m on the record for that.
Griffin: Are you trying to convince him to leave, or is this Duck being kind of scared?
Justin: Duck has lived a life not worrying about physical danger, right?
Griffin: Right.
Justin: I mean, he’s lived a life not worrying about that, so I think having to process that is— like, imagine that, if you lived for four decades being invulnerable, and suddenly you were. And you didn’t know what was— Like, you were thinking about things as what is dangerous and what is not for the first time in your entire life. Like I think he is processing it, but I think he still knows that it’s dangerous and this is his job, and this is the best hope they have, but [clears throat] I don’t think he’s crazy about it, let me say that.
Griffin: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. He hesitates for a second, and you see him lower his, his revolver, and he says,
Sheriff Owens: I mean— ah, god. You might-- You’re probably—
Griffin: And then you hear a sound in the distance, this loud roaring. It is getting louder and closer, super fast, and Sheriff Owens turns to face it, and then you see Hollis pull up on top of their motorbike, and they make a running stop. They are running off the bike and letting it slide and- and fall over. And they run up towards you. They’ve got this long rebar club that’s got this handle of just like wrapped leather around the bottom of it. And they are wielding it, and they move closer to you, and they say,
Hollis: It’s close, right?
Duck: What?
Hollis: The f— the monster, come on, Duck! Are you really gonna keep pretending?
Duck: Nah, honestly, I’m happy you’re here. Three of us means we’re um— well, we’re still probably gonna die, but it’s, like, better odds for sure. Um. So you wanna help us fight Bigfoot? ‘Cause Bigfoot’s real. Let me catch you up: Bigfoot’s real, and I feel comfortable telling you about that because I feel like there’s an 80% chance you, me, and Dupree over here are going to fuckin’ beef town. [Griffin, Travis, and Clint laugh] You know, we don’t have much of a choice here, folks, but let’s keep rolling. Anyway, Bigfoot’s real, now you’re caught up, let’s go kill it.
Griffin: Both of them are just staring at you with blank, shocked expressions, and then there is another sound. There is this heavy breathing, like screeching, almost like taunting noise that is pingpong-ing all, all around you in the woods, almost like it’s toying with you, trying to scare the three of you. Um. And then suddenly, Duck, you notice a shadow above falling on the three of you, and you see Bigfoot pouncing downward toward your party. What do you do?
Justin: He’s flying through the air down at me?
Griffin: He has, like, jumped down off of the boughs of a tree and is coming down towards the three of you.
Justin: All right, I am going to— I mean, I don’t even think about it, really. I-- I probably should, but I don’t think about it. I-- I just swing— I pull Beacon out in one motion and take a swing at him.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: I-- I-- I swing at him. That is a 9 plus 2, is 11, so I pull Beacon out with one movement, just slice right across the middle, and then I was like,
Duck: Oh, guys, one more thing! My belt’s a sword! Anyway... [laughter] Shit. Now you’re caught up.
Griffin: You get to—
Beacon: —and I can talk!
Duck: Yeah. Oh yeah! Shit! My belt’s a sword, I just stabbed Bigfoot.
Beacon: I can talk.
Duck: And those are the three things. Now you are indeed caught up. Let’s go.
Griffin: You get to pick one extra effect here. Uhhh, you gain the advantage, take one forward, you inflict terrible harm, you suffer less harm, or you force them where you want them.
Justin: I am probably gonna, um— you know, I’m not gonna take this thing on my own, I feel pretty confident about that. Um.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: I’m gonna force them where I want them. I’m gonna try to knock him down on the ground and maybe give us time to escape.
Griffin: Uhh, okay. You don’t know that the other two people here want to escape, but—
Justin: —I’m pretty sure they don’t.
Griffin: Okay. The three of you were kind of clustered together, kinda back to back to back, watching the perimeter, and the Bigfoot dove down towards your group, and with like the power of your slash— which has to have taken you by surprise, right? You’re not Superman anymore, but you just did a badass attack and cut this thing for 2 Harm, right?
Justin: Yeah. I think that one of the important things to realize is that Beacon is also a sentient sword, so I kind of feel like even though I’m Mundane, it’s probably better than just some asshole with a metal belt, [crosstalk] right?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Justin: He does have something of a mind of his own.
Griffin: And as the whip sword just caught Bigfoot perfectly with the tip, it sort of disrupted, uh, his dive, so you are the only one that catches the brunt of the harm that he dishes out. He, I mean, he just smashes, tackles you with tremendous force, and you take 2 Harm, which your helmet cushions the blow of a little bit. And he rolls to the ground. And with that, like, now Hollis, they just run up with this big rebar club and take a golf swing and smashes this, this Bigfoot across the face. And like without hesitating, Sheriff Owens spins on his heels and empties his revolver in the direction of the Bigfoot and, and catches him with a few of the bullets. And with that, the Bigfoot falls dramatically and then tries to right itself, and ah, just like limps off deeper into the woods. And Hollis and Sheriff Owens are like, already giving chase.
Duck: Good work! I did think we were gonna die there, but we can go die deeper in the woods. That’s fine. Let’s go, come on!
Griffin: [laughing] As you, as you—
Duck: —Make it real hard. You know what? Get a few more miles up there, this is gonna be true crime podcast material. You know, I’d love to be able to create that. That’s a system of perpetual giving right there. Come on! Let’s go.
Griffin: You are pursuing them pursuing the Bigfoot. You’re nearing a, like, treeline, and when you see it, you realize where you are. You realize what you’re close to. You realize where this thing is leading you all. And you break through the treeline alongside Hollis and Sheriff Owens, and you are standing in the clearing with the archway. And the Bigfoot is nowhere to be seen, it is quiet now. It has led you all here, and Hollis says,
Hollis: This is exactly where I lost sight of it last time.
Griffin: And Owens nods in acknowledgement, and both of them start sweeping the perimeter. And that’s when you remember, they can’t see the gate because they don’t know it’s there. But they are looking around trying to catch the trail of this monster again. What do you do?
Justin: Is it going back through the— it escaping through the archway would be bad? Good? Neutral? Like how would I, in my role, how would I feel about that.
Griffin: It would be peculiar, I feel like. It is, it is-- You have not seen a monster go through the archway. You have never seen a monster actually cross through the archway, so you don’t know. It’s also been using these rifts, so you’re not entirely sure. It could be either of those things.
One important thing is that it’s still, ah— it is not the middle of the night. There’s no moonlight shining down, so the archway is not, like, active. So you can see that it’s dormant... its dormant state. But the two of them are wandering around this clearing, looking for any sign of this monster that they can. They have not collided with this thing? You remember Duck didn’t know it was there— or, Ned didn’t know it was there but he crashed his car into it. So they are sweeping the field here, trying to find the Bigfoot.
Justin: Either Investigate A Mystery or Read A Bad Situation, would one of those—
Griffin: Yeah!
Justin: —hold, be useful here? Which one would be more—
Griffin: Probably Read A Bad Situation.
Justin: Okay. Let me do that.
Griffin: Ooh, that’s a good roll!
Justin: Of course. Yeah, it’s an 11.
Griffin: Plus Sharp?
Justin: Plus Sharp, which is 1, so it’s a 12.
Griffin: Nice.
Justin: Read A Bad Situation. I’m gonna say... I can hold three of these. What’s the best way to protect the victims? Griffin: Um... hm.
Justin: I, in this case, would describe as the other two cats.
Griffin: Uh, yeah, I mean, you might also be on— you realize, you could [crosstalk] potentially be on the list, right.
Justin: [crosstalk] And me, but that’s like, weird.
Griffin: The best way to actively save the three of you right now is like— your instincts were right earlier. You are no match for this thing. I think, actually, here’s what you get from that. When it fell down earlier, when you all lit it up, you can tell that it was faking. You can tell that like-- it wanted you to think that it was weakened, and so the best way to protect the victims, which is the three of you, potentially, is to… is to get them the fuck out of there.
Justin: All right.
Griffin: You have two more.
Justin: Okay, what’s my best way out?
Griffin: I think it’s-- With that, I think you definitely know you can get them to Amnesty Lodge from here. You’ve walked that path so many times, that if you all really need to get the fuck out of there, you can get them to, to Amnesty Lodge really quickly and not have to worry about this thing ah, slaughtering you in the woods.
Justin: All right. What is… Are there any dangers we haven’t noticed?
Griffin: With that one, you can see— the other two are poking around the other side of the clearing, and behind them, behind another treeline, you can see the Bigfoot. And its face is like-- not this monstrous mask of death anymore, like it is more... It is calm and pensive. It’s like you just went backstage and you saw the actors just hanging out and not being these— you know, putting on this-- the pageantry of the play, and you can read the emotion on this Bigfoot’s face, and it is frustrated, and it is confused, and it is looking at the two people that it led here, um. And then it looks over, and it sees you, and it smiles. And then it steps backward and disappears.
transition music
Griffin: So, Aubrey, you're not in the sheriff's department anymore, you're somewhere very strange. You look around and you've got the ah, the form of Deputy Dewey in front of you, but both of you are just inside of this massive hollow sphere? And all around you everywhere are-- are visions that are so far away you can barely make out, like, what they are. It's like you are surrounded by like a sky box in a video game? Just this huge static image that surrounds you on all sides. And you see like root systems growing downward through lush green fields, ah, and rivers of magma, and ah, waves on the ocean, and it looks like you're looking up at all this stuff from like below a big glass table. You see these, like, little pinpricks of light everywhere, just like concentrated heavily around certain parts of this sphere you're inside and sparse in others, and some of them are moving and some are flickering and reappearing somewhere else.
You are in the middle of just like this massive eco-ball, and Dewey's form is floating in front of you and he is motionless but his wounds are gone. And then floating on the other side of Dewey, a figure appears, and it has a hand extended and pressed gently on Dewey's chest. And this figure is a woman, and, and you get this like feeling when you look at her and it's the kind of feeling you get when you swear you've met someone before but like a thousand times stronger than that. This presence feels like it could be family, like it could be your sister if you, if you had one. And you feel this warmth and familiarity with this, this figure, this person, who so closely like... resembles you, in a way. And they actually look like a little surprised to see you, and she does a little wave. What do you do?
Aubrey: Magic? Are you magic?
Griffin: She like cocks her head to the side and smiles and does not take her hand off of Dewey. And she kind of like gestures down towards him.
Aubrey: Are you... You're helping me do... magic, right, to help Dewey?
Griffin: She looks up at you and smiles and nods.
Aubrey: Awesome. Hey. Thanks. I sure do-- appreciate it?
[Justin and Clint laugh]
Griffin: She takes her other hand now and places it, uh— She actually, no, what she does is she reaches out with her other hand and she grabs you by the wrist. It feels like you've just grabbed a, like a live wire, but not painful? You just feel this rush of euphoria and energy as she touches you, and she places your hand on Dewey and then she nods.
Aubrey: Okay, let's... let's do this! Should we chant, like ""heal heal hea—"" or is, what..?
Griffin: She is so focused on Dewey right now that she does not— She actually closes her eyes, and, uh, now you can feel that energy again, almost like it is sort of being pushed through Dewey, like you've formed like a conduit with this, this, this placing— laying on hands that the two of you are doing. And Dewey starts to glow? Just this beautiful light. and then—
Travis: He's pregnant!
Griffin: He is pregnant, he's a wonderful pregnant, uh, deputy. And then this figure looks up at you and she opens her eyes and she just has these bright orange glowing eyes. [Travis gasps] And then you wake up, and you are locked in a cell! Uh, you—
Travis: Super cool.
Griffin: You can see from where you are that, that Detective Megan has left the building. She apparently awoke at some point and dragged you in here and dipped? There's nobody in here as far as you can tell. Dewey you can see is laying on the floor and he is... he is not breathing. Detective Megan has actually covered him up with uhh, with a cloth, but you can see Dewey's form under there.
Travis: Uh...
Aubrey: Dewey, wake up! Dewey. I command you!
Griffin: Dewey... [laughs]
Aubrey: Rise! Dewey!
Justin: Dewey, come forth.
Aubrey: Dewey!
Clint: Dewey!
Travis/Aubrey: Rise, Dewey! My children of the night!
[Several laugh]
Griffin: Um, Dewey does not rise.
Aubrey: Rise! Rise!
Griffin: But what you do see is from behind the desk in the reception hall, in the lobby there, you see a ring of keys? And you see them just kind of, like, shake a little bit, and then they lift up and they slide across the um— they slide across the desk and then they come into the room that you're in with the cells, and you can kind of see some sort of like... They are floating around on this fog, and it's taking shape, this fog is, as the keys get closer, and they go into the gate of the cell that you're in and you hear the lock click and the gate swings open and this fog has fully taken form. It's Deputy Dewey and... he's a ghost.
Justin: Aw shit.
Travis/Aubrey: Aw dang, Dewey.

Griffin: Previously, on The Adventure Zone…
Presence: There is no more time to delay, Duck Newton! Events have been put into motion that require your immediate action.
Justin: I mean, I guess I run through the gate.
Griffin: You hear the sound of the monster getting louder and louder and… you run toward this empty gate, and then we see that clearing again, and the archway, within which Duck Newton was just standing, is empty.
Griffin: You catch Dani out of the corner of your eye, and you get a little nervous for a second, and then a big blast of fire appears in your hands.
Travis: Yes.
Mama: There’s another world connected to our own.
Griffin: And one by one, they transform.
Mama: So, that’s the truth of the matter. Monsters are… real!
Griffin: The bobcat starts charging toward you, and Barclay looks at you, and he says:
Barclay: God, I hope you can keep a secret!
Griffin: And in the blink of an eye, this gentle, bearded man you were just talking to disappears, and in his place… is Bigfoot!
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
{1:42}
Griffin: Ned… there’s Bigfoot, Ned! He is standing about seven… seven and a half feet tall?
Travis: How many hands, Griffin? How many hands tall?
Griffin: Uh, like, twelve Bigfoot hands.
Travis: Whoa!
Griffin: Yeah, and those are big hands.
Clint: That’s a big Bigfoot.
Griffin: He is covered in fur that makes your current sort of Wookiee outfit, which you’re definitely still wearing, which is such a charming little scene? It makes your Wookiee outfit look positively inauthentic. And he’s racing toward this lifeless but animated bobcat, and the two of them crash together a couple dozen yards in front of you. Your car is a couple dozen yards behind you. What do you do?
Clint: Oh, I run for the car! Ned runs for the car.
Griffin: Okay. And—
Travis: And you’re still wearing the Bigfoot snowshoes
Clint: No, I kicked off the snowshoes, I’m sorry.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I kicked off the snowshoes and the gloves.
Griffin: You just left those behind?
Clint: Hell yeah! I gotta get in the car!
Justin: All right.
Clint: Ned’s gotta get in the car, man.
Travis: Now, I do wanna remind- a bobcat is not, like, a mountain lion, right? A bobcat is, like—
Griffin: I’m envisioning, like, about that size. Big ol’ cat. So you’re—
Travis: That’s a biiiiig bobcat.
Griffin: You’re just gonna take off?
Clint: Oh, I’m gonna jump behind the wheel of the car— let me explain somethin’ a li’l about Ned’s mindset.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Ned is not ordinarily somebody that jumps into the fire. Ned is not somebody who likes to fight. If Ned can avoid a conflict, he will. But in this case, Ned, having just seen a man transform into a Bigfoot and see a ghoulish bobcat, is absolutely, one hundred percent convinced this is a dream.
Griffin: Okay—
Clint: So Ned is going to live it as if it’s a dream.
Griffin: Alright, it’s about dusk, so you hop behind the wheel of the car and sort of, fumbling, maybe a little nervous, start the ignition, and as you do, the headlights kick on, and now you can see this fight scene happening in front of you much clearer, [Clint: Oh, yeah.] and you see that this bobcat has Barclay pinned down. [Clint: Yep!] And Barclay’s kind of in trouble, it’s sorta slashin’ at him and tearing at him, and it looks like this thing’s got the upper hand on Barclay.
Clint: Oh, yeah, well I throw the Lincoln into drive and gun it, because it’s a dream, man! Let’s enjoy it, let’s have some adventure, he’s been stuck in this crummy museum, so he’s gonna floor it and drive it right at them.
Griffin: O...kay. Um… are you trying to hit both of them?
Clint: I am going to drive straight for them and hope that the Bigfoot, that Barclay is able to either roll away, or—
Justin: Lot easier to hit the Bigfoot than the bobcat, batch.
Griffin: [laughing] No, no, no, it’s… yeah.
Clint: It’s a dream! If I get ‘em both, it’s two monsters, what’s the big deal?
Travis: “So, did you listen to that new Adventure Zone?” “Yeah, I really liked it, then Dad killed Bigfoot?”
Clint: Yeah…
Griffin: “Who was, like, a dude? And then...”
Clint: I am—
Travis: “Who he spoke to, and was already a fan-favorite, but now he’s dead, I guess!”
Clint: Ned is a terrific driver, remember, that’s one of his things.
Griffin: [sarcastically] I didn’t know he could lift a car up in the air while he was driving it to specific—!
[Travis laughs]
Clint: He is going to do some amazing Joie Chitwood stunt driving shit—
Justin: No-scope car skills.
Griffin: You’re gonna have to roll to Act Under Pressure [Travis: Real good.], and I will remind you the way that rolls in this game work: if you don’t do amazing, things can happen.
Travis: And I wanna remind everybody, ‘cause we didn’t do this at all in the last two episodes, you have the Luck option… that you can exercise at any time—
Griffin: Yeah, so we have not talked about Luck. Luck is a fascinating thing in this game, and it kinda makes up for the fact that there’s not, like, a ton of healing, or whatever? You have a meter, and I think it has, like, seven marks in it. And this is for your character’s whole career, you never refill this, you never really get this back, where, if you want to, at any time, you can change a roll to a 12 or avoid all harm from an injury, and you mark one luck. Now, once you’ve gotten rid of all your luck, really bad things can start happening to you. I basically get to go as hard on you as I possibly wanna go, because you are what the game calls Doomed, at that point, so… but, yeah, let’s do this thing!
Clint: All right, so, I can invoke- do I do it before I roll?
Travis: No, I think you do it post.
Griffin: Yes, it is reactionary.
Clint: Okay.
Justin: And it should be a pretty desperate thing, right, ‘cause you’ve only got seven—
Griffin: It is worst-case scenario things. Like, for instance, if you’re gonna kill Bigfoot with your car, you may wanna use a li’l bit of luck on it.
Justin: All right, Clint, just- well, ‘kay, that’s legit.
Clint: Eleven.
Griffin: All right!
Justin: Dad has his—
Clint: And I add a plus one for driving. I get plus one to any rating…
Griffin: Wait, what is it?
Clint: Plus one ongoing while driving.
Griffin: Yeah, this would definitely count for that, so that’s a 12.
Travis: Sick, bro.
Griffin: Yeah, with that, Barclay is fighting this bobcat and is kind of underneath it, and then sees the headlights, like, soaring towards him, and he puts a foot on the bobcat’s chest as it’s sort of on top of him, and flings it backwards, and then quickly rolls out of the way, and the Bigfoot— the bobcat sort of slams right into the hood of the Continental as you are going. And it’s a big, sturdy boat, so a mountain cat slamming into [Clint: Detroit, man!] it doesn’t do a whole lotta damage to the car. It does plenty of damage to the bobcat, who just rolls over the car, and then I imagine you bring it to a halt, after that, as you see in your rearview mirror…
Clint: I do one of those sweet moves where I change the gear shift, slam on the brakes, it does a little curve and [Travis: Oh E-brake.] pulls up right next to Barclay.
Griffin: Ah, alright yeah you look in your rearview mirror the bobcat is not moving. And then from your rearview mirror you see the bobcat defeated on the ground, although it looks just as lifeless now as it did during its attack, and sort of right as it lands that black fluid that was dripping out of its mouth, it like spastically shoots out of its body in these thick rivulets which kind of tangle together on the ground before slithering, like with a will of its own, quickly back into the forest. Like within a few seconds that black fluid is out of sight.
Ned: Hahaha! How hideously obnoxious! [chuckles] I love this dream!
Travis: You’re going a little bit Odin there. Was that what you were going for?
Justin: “Tiny man”!
Clint: Ned’s having fun, man. He doesn’t think any of this is real.
Griffin: Let’s jump over to Duck. Duck, you stepped through the gate, and for a moment…
Travis: Can I just say I’ve been kicking myself since we recorded because none of us made an “Exit, Pursued by Bear” comment.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: And it was right like there, you guys.
Clint: Sorry.
Griffin: Yeah, we could have done that, and then we could have done some quick improv games, like maybe some Freeze, and then we’d talk about like, what song from Jesus Christ Superstar’s our favorite.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Duck, you step through the gate, and you’re in this bright place for just a moment, Duck, and the wind that you felt whipping at you from the stone archway is still blowing through you while you’re in this space. But you’re quickly out of it and the light fades, and you know you’re somewhere else. But your vision is somehow… off. Almost like you’re seeing this place with, like, a watercolor filter. Everything is kind of shifting wildly. Almost like the A-ha video.
[Clint starts riffing Take On Me]
Griffin: Yeah. And you also feel somewhat sick, and kind of like, angry? It is disorienting, to say the least. And behind you, pretty close to you, you can see it despite your sort of disorientation, there’s another stone gate in this place identical to the one you entered. And from the hard stone floor that you’re laying on you can tell that whatever, wherever this gate is, it is enclosed inside of another, sort of large stone structure. There are these massive pillars propping up the ceiling overhead. And through the pillars you can see the world outside. Only your vision is so, sort of, impaired that you can only faintly make out, like, there are some bright colorful shapes in the distance, some round buildings. There’s a massive castle beyond them, with a large orange shape jutting out of the ground just in front of that castle. And you feel that anger inside of you just kind of building, almost unnaturally, and it’s alarming, but not quite as alarming as these two figures who are standing in front of a pillar, a pair of columns in front of you, who respond to your presence with surprise, and in an instant they are on you, jabbing you with these rods, and you feel this shock, and you’re unconscious.
And when you awaken, you are in a dark, small room, and your arms are bound to a wooden chair positioned in front of a big, sturdy wooden table. And you feel something soft and light draped around your neck, and as you kind of look down you realized you’re wearing some sort of scarf that your captors placed on you. It’s made of some sort of incredibly soft fabric that you can’t quite deduce. And for whatever reason that anger and disorientation you felt when you entered this place is just gone. You’re Duck again. And seated across from you is a person, you can’t really tell too much about them other than that, thanks to the large set of chainmail armor they’re wearing, covered by a tabard featuring an orange crystal radiating light in every direction. You can faintly see these two black, beady eyes through a slit in the helmet this person’s wearing, which is adorned with two goat’s horns on top. And as you regain consciousness, strapped to this chair and front of this table in this dark room, this person immediately addresses you, and they say:
Person: You’re in a lot of trouble right now, but I want you to know that I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. Because based on your outfit, I’m guessing you’re part of some sort of local woodland army, or forest militia, or something like that.
Duck: Yeah, that’ll do.
Griffin: He says:
Person: We’re both men of the law, and so I’m hoping we can come to an understanding here. I’m thinking maybe you just stumbled into the gate accidentally. Maybe you didn’t come here with any ill intent. Am I on the right track?
Travis: [same accent] “Now I’m just a small kingdom lawyer”
[Clint laughs]
Duck: Yeah, I mean, that pretty much sums it up.
Person: What’s your name, pal?
Duck: It’s Duck. Duck Newton.
Vincent: Excellent name, powerful name. I’m Vincent.
[Laughter]
Duck: It’s a nickname.
Vincent: I’m Vincent, and uh, well, before we go any further I gotta know, and this is real important that you tell the truth now, all right? I need to know how you knew that the gate was there in the first place. Did the human called “Mama” tell you?
Duck: Mama... No, I don’t know… I mean, I know my mama, but I don’t know a Mama. To be honest, uh, it was just sort of there, man. I don’t know. It just sort of appeared. I was being pursued by a large, I would say non-Earth bear, maybe. [Griffin laughs] I dunno, I ain’t never seen its like. And I just kinda ran for the gate, man, I’ll be honest I don’t really have a great explanation for you. I’ll say this, you know, I’m not freaking out right now, I’ve seen some weird shit in the past and narrowly avoided being sorta looped up in it, seems that ship has sailed [laughs], but I’m, you know, all non-malicious on my part. Just trying to “Exit, pursued by bear.”
[Everyone laughs, Travis cheers]
Griffin: He takes out a little notebook from a fold in his tabard, and he’s writing down some of the stuff that you say almost like he’s taking a statement. And he takes his pencil and he taps at a point of his notes and he says:
Vincent: A big, non-Earth bear, huh?
Griffin: He says:
Vincent: Well it sounds like Mama’s maybe not keepin’ up her end of the bargain, but I guess we’ll circle back on that later.
Duck: I mean I’m not saying, I don’t know if you wanna write this down, I’m not saying that it was a space bear. I just, you know, not sorta a regular bear, you know?
Griffin: He says:
Vincent: Believe me, I know better than you might think. But I still don’t understand how you found the gate. It is unfortunate that you don’t know how ‘cause, buddy, I can’t let you leave here until I figure out where the hole in our security protocols lies.
Griffin: And with that, this figure takes off their helmet, and as they do so you notice those two goat horns on top of the helmet actually slide through holes on the top of the helmet as it’s removed. And they place their helmet gently on the table, and as they do, you see the face of the person sitting across from you. It’s the face of a goat.
{16:05}
Aubrey, you are walking in the woods behind Amnesty Lodge with Mama, who is carrying an oil lantern in one hand as she leads you swiftly through the pines. And you’ve just left the Amnesty Lodge after, sort of, the big reveal from the last episode, and she says:
Mama: Now there’s somethin’ I need to show you, but before we do anything else Aubrey I need you to swear on your life that you’re not gonna tell another soul about what you learned tonight. Can you do that? I’m not, I don’t want you to take this lightly, this is like end of the world-level secret. I need your absolute discretion on this.
Aubrey: Mama, not only do I swear on my life, I swear on the life of Dr. Harris Bonkers, PhD.
Clint: Woah.
Griffin: Is Dr. Harris Bonkers with you? Is Dr. Harris Bonkers always with you?
Travis: Do you mean like, spiritually?
Griffin: And physically.
Travis: Oh, um, yeah. You know the term I’ve been thinking about a lot, and I think Aubrey has, now that she has done real magic, is “Familiar.”
Griffin: Yes yes yes yes yes yes.
Travis: Okay. But I think maybe for this, I think just because it’s dangerous maybe she left Dr. Harris Bonkers with Dani.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, I think Dani was happy to play with Dr. Harris Bonkers.
Travis: Does Dani have kind of a Laura Dern vibe?
Griffin: I don’t, we’ll figure out Dani’s relation to Laura Dern, I think, as we play. It’s one of those things you’re supposed to leave empty spaces in the world and fill it out as you go.
Travis: Yeah, I understand.
Clint: Last Jedi Laura Dern? Jurassic Park Laura Dern?
Travis: Jurassic Park Laura Dern was where I was—
Clint: Jurassic Park Laura Dern, okay.
Griffin: Peak Dern.
Travis: Peak Dern. We’re talkin’ about top Dern here.
Griffin: Mama says:
Mama: I don’t mean to scare you, Aubrey. It’s just, can you imagine what would happen if the wrong people learned about a place full of magic and monsters? And everything? What they might do to take advantage of that kinda power, to own it? I have to—
Aubrey: Mama, let me reassure you right now. I can make fire with my mind? I’m not really scared of anything. So…
Griffin: She says:
Mama: I know that, but it’s important you understand the gravity of the situation. ‘Cause I’ve dedicated my entire adult life to keepin’ that stuff out of the public eye. It is the most important thing we do around these parts.
Aubrey: Uh-huh.
Griffin: And you’re walking a bit further into the woods and she starts to explain, she says:
Mama: Okay, so, this other world, it’s called Sylvane.
Griffin: Which by the way I picked that name out like a year ago, then when dad had a character called Sylvane in TAZ: Commitment I was like “Oh, interesting.” It’s a good—
Travis: Wheels within wheels, my friends.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: Well, you actually returned the favor because I got Silvane from an actor that I worked with, Remy Silvane.
Griffin: Woah.
Clint: And then you turned around in the same episode and named your character Remy.
Griffin: Yeah, it was a—
Travis: Sympatico. I also want everyone to picture that during this whole walk, and like, as Mama’s talking she is just, Aubrey is like snapping her fingers and making, like lighting a lighter, like lighting a Zippo.
Griffin: Absolutely. I love it.
Clint: Always good to do in a forest, yeah.
Travis: Well she’s snapping her fingers, and like her thumb catches on fire, then she’s snapping it out, and just kinda doing that [makes snapping sound] on and off.
Griffin: I love this, we got some of that in Commitment, the few minutes after you discover you have superpowers. Okay, anyway, Mama says:
Mama: Sylvane, Aubrey, it’s an incredible place, it is a living world. And I mean that literally. Whole place is alive, sustaining its inhabitants with this magic power and that’s a thing that those inhabitants are understandably pretty protective of.
Aubrey: Uh-huh.
Mama: But problem is, throughout history, those gates on our side have been poppin’ up all over the place, and humans have been crossing over into Sylvane and making a mess of things. Made some bad blood between us and the Sylvs. It’s hard to blame either side, really, ‘cuz where these gates appear on earth so do the, well, we call ‘em Abominations. But don’t you worry none ‘bout that though, that’s mine and Barclay’s cross to bear, not yours. But the worse that things got in Sylvane, because of the humans, the stricter their laws got. And today they got some pretty Draconian laws in effect governing who can and can’t live there. And the outcasts, well they don’t really got anywhere to go. Hence, the Amnesty Lodge. I give those Sylvs a safe place to sleep at night, and that seems about the least that I can do for ‘em. And Aubrey, I don’t know nothin’ about your life and what you want from it, but you could be safe there too, I think. Somehow, you fit into this picture, I know it.
Aubrey: Okay!
{21:16}
Griffin: Let’s jump back to Ned. You see Barclay kinda wounded. He’s got some big scratches down his neck, and his torso, and he’s kinda shambling away from the car towards the bobcat, and he hunches down and looks at the bobcat kind of rolls it over, eyeballs it, sees it’s thoroughly dead, and he walks a little bit closer to—
Travis: [in singsong voice] Not merely dead, but really most sincerely dead.
Justin: [crosstalk] So let’s get back to the showtunes.
Griffin: [crosstalk] How many more musical theatre references can we make in this show? [laughter] And then he walks a little bit closer to the car and he hunches down and he picks up that hempen bracelet up off the ground. And he wraps it back around his wrist and instantly, he’s Barclay again.
Travis: Is he still injured in this form, Ditto?
Griffin: Yeah, in this human form, Ned, you can actually see those scratches are still there. He’s breathing sort of heavily. He’s not like, horribly injured, but he’s definitely sort of battle damaged nonetheless. And he walks over to you, Ned, and opens up the passenger-side door and gets inside. And he puts on his seatbelt, I think, ‘cause he’s a very safe boy. And he says:
Barclay: You said you’ve been to Amnesty Lodge before, right, Ned?
Ned: Yeah, I uh, obtained one of your delicious Monte Cristos.
Barclay: Yeah, the sandwich was great.
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: I need you to get me there—
Ned: And I think there was a junior Chamber of Commerce meeting there, I believe.
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: I need you to get me there right away, Ned. I can explain everything when we get there.
Ned: Are you sure you wouldn’t rather go to a vet?
Griffin: He kinda chuckles, and then as he laughs he’s kinda like, hurting a little bit, and so he kinda catches himself, and he says:
Barclay: No, we gotta get to the lodge. I can’t, for obvious reasons, I kinda can’t go to any sort of medical practitioner back in Kepler.
Ned: Of course, of course.
Griffin: As he’s saying that, you see a couple more shapes stalk out of the woods, I think it’s just two more bobcats, and they’re sort of prowling like jungle cat style out of the woods towards your car, and he says:
Barclay: I know this is a lot to take in right now, I know you probably think you’re in some sort of weird dream, I assure you—
Ned: Oh yes, I certainly do.
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: I assure you, it is not, things are pretty bad right now and if you wanna keep Kepler safe I need you to get me to the lodge, all right?
Ned: Oh good, that’s good, I like that. You’ve kind of heightened the danger. Of course, my friend! Let’s go to the lodge, you must do me one favor. Try not to bleed on the fine corinthian leather, all right?
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: I’ll do my best?
Ned: Onward!
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: Take the woods, Ned, time’s of the essence, I can get us through it, but I need you to cut as straight a path as you can, all right?
Ned: [laughs] You got it.
Clint: I throw it into drive, I press the pedal and yell:
Ned: Yoinks! And away!
Griffin: Do you aim for either of the bobcats as you’re driving forward?
Clint: Ah hell no, I’ll throw it in reverse.
Griffin: All right.
Clint: And yell “Yoinks and away!”
Griffin: All right, you take off into the woods towards the Amnesty Lodge. And we’re moving at a nice clip right now, boys. I’m gonna jump back to Duck.
Duck: All right, listen, I got some questions for you. What’s the name of this place? What are the laws that dictate who can and can’t cross over? [Griffin laughs] On the other side, what are those, where do the people who get caught from the other side stay? I need these questions answered in excruciating, lengthy detail. I am not aware—
Clint: Between you and Vincent, you’re playing bad ranger, good ranger.
Duck: I am not aware of any of the answers to these questions. Please begin and include them—
Griffin: I think— You guys are all about to meet up, so I think there will be some sharing of notes once that happens so that we don’t create a, uh, a hole in the fuckin’ narrative universe I’m trying to piece together.
{25:25}
Travis: [crosstalk] No, this is where the propeller spins, the goat man answers all of the questions, and then Duck’s like, “Oh, okay! That all totally makes sense.”
Griffin: Vincent, the Goatman, which is not pejorative, there’s a real cryptid named that, says—
Justin: [laughing] Vincent the Goat Man? That’s very familiar.
Clint: [singing] Vincent the Goat Man!
Griffin: Well, just the Goatman. He looks at you, and maybe you are a little bit uneasy, ‘cause it’s now this sort of humanoid goat talking to you. He says:
Vincent: So— our two worlds, Duck, they have something of an uneasy truce, and it’s based around your side keeping the existence of our side under wraps. So when strangers just stumble into our world, you can understand how that’s a problem for me. I’m kind of in charge of homeland security around here. So I need you to tell me— and really think about it— how did you first find out about the gate?
Duck: Well, first off, I wouldn’t say I stumbled. I did move with sort of a dignified gait into the gate; it was very purposeful, let me start there. Secondly, um… so I’ve got this… aeeehhhh... I guess you’d call it, like, a weird… spirit, kind of thing, that’s been tryin’ to get me— used to try really hard, um, and then kind of let up, uh, to sort of… I guess, fight evil? I know that sounds ridiculous, but, uh, sort of fight evil. And they popped back up— I kind of thought it was a dream for a long time, but seein’ it just recently sorta dispelled that notion. So I think maybe, maybe they showed it to me? I’m honestly grasping at straws here, man, I’m a little bit out of my depth.
Griffin: He is writing all this down in his notebook, and he kinda chews on the end of his pencil. And he catches himself chewing on it a little bit too much, and then he like pulls it out of his mouth, and he looks a little bit sheepish. Or goatish.
[Clint laughs]
Justin: Goatish, thank you.
Griffin: Then he says, um:
Vincent: Well, Duck, I wish I could say something to help, but that doesn’t really ring a bell for me. What you gotta understand about Sylvane— that’s what this place is called, by the way—
Justin: Thank you.
Vincent: This really ain’t a place that builds up, you know, prophecies, and heroes of legend to fight evil, and stuff like that. We’re a bit more humble than that. It kinda goes against our whole ethos, you see.
Duck: See, that’s what I’m talking about! I think I could hang here, honestly. Like, that sounds pretty good to me.
Vincent: Um, I wish I could help you out, but that’s not really possible. Resources are— well, they’re pretty scarce around here, it’s a really—
Duck: No, you’re— you’re— listen, I’m havin’ a bit of fun, man. I got a job I gotta get back to and stuff, and there’s apparently some sort of space bear in my forest, so I do need to rectify that pretty quickly, but, uh—
Griffin: He says:
Vincent: Yeah, I’ll have to talk about that with Mama next time I see her, but— um, listen, uh… I’m just as eager to avoid a war between our worlds as the next Sylv, {{28:53}} so how about this? Why don’t we let—
Griffin: I’m trying to avoid giving him an Appalachian accent. It’s hard to switch that switch back off. He says:
Vincent: So, how about this? Why don’t we let bygones be bygones, and I will let you go back through the gate unhindered, but you gotta promise me, Duck, you gotta forget this night ever happened. You walk through that gate and never come back. And you don’t tell anybody about the gate, or Sylvane... or the cool Goatman you talked to, and we won’t have a problem.
Duck: Okay, listen, partner. Right underneath preservation of forest and the wildlife within, my number two skill is forgettin’ ‘bout weird shit, [Clint laughs] so you have come to the right department, here. That is no issue. Can I ask, as long as you know that your buddy Duck can keep a secret, what’s with the fancy, uh, the neckwear here?
Vincent: Oh, that. The scarf is, um, well, it’s mine, actually. It’s Sylvan wool. It’s one of the curious parts about our arrangement of our two worlds and their connection. If a human steps foot into Silvane without wearin’ a garment from this world, they… they just absolutely lose it. Most of the assaults on this world—they happened long before my time, but from what I heard, those unadorned humans who crossed over went into somethin’ of a rage and tore the place apart without a second thought. Broke Sylvane’s heart right in two. You take that scarf off, and I imagine you’d get pretty hostile too.
Travis: Humans are the worst.
Griffin: He says:
Vincent: I will take that back, but only once we get you to the gate ready to cross back over. Listen—
Duck: So technically I guess it’d be mohair, right? I mean, if you made it yourself. Is this your own—?
Vincent: No, God, it’s not from my— Jesus. It’s not from my—
Clint: [laughing] That’s what I thought too!
Vincent: That would be pretty gross. No, it’s mine. I wear it to keep warm. It’s not from my fur, Duck.
Travis: “It’s Burberry!”
Griffin: He says:
Vincent: Listen, Duck, I’m— I’m trying to be a good guy right now, Duck, which is tough for somebody in my position, so I gotta warn you: I’m not the type to really forgive someone who backs out on a deal. So keep up your end of the bargain, and please do not make me regret this night, all right?
Duck: Listen, I’d ask you to shake on it, but I have a feeling that could break weird pretty quick.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: He puts up a hand. You notice, actually, that his bottom half, his, like, hindquarters, is straight up goat legs, but then he has these long, furry fingers on his hands that he holds up. He actually takes off, like, a gauntlet that he’s wearing and holds it over the table.
Clint: [breathlessly] Oh my god, it’s Pan. It’s Pan!
Duck: I’ll be dipped in shit and rolled in breadcrumbs, [Clint: Call me Dan!] look at you, you got— you got hands and everything. All right! Uh, well, let’s shake on it, then.
Griffin: All right, you shake on it.
{32:05}
Let’s jump back to Aubrey. Aubrey, you’ve been hiking through the woods with Mama for about 20 minutes now, and—
Aubrey: Are we there yet? I mean, I don’t want to be that person, but, like… I’m wearing combat boots?
Griffin: She says:
Mama: Well, Aubrey, believe me when I tell you, you’re gonna know when we’re there.
Aubrey: And I don’t, oh, I so don’t want to complain, but I’m just— it’s late, and it’s— I set fire to a hotel, and then I saw a werewolf, and I’m—
Mama: No, you’re having a pretty big night. I can get that.
Aubrey: Yeah, and I can do magic! It’s just been a big day, you know?
Mama: We got a room ready for you back at the lodge, and it’s— I don’t mean to brag, but it’s a pretty nice little setup we got there, so—
Aubrey: Do you guys do in-room dining, or—?
Mama: We can? I mean, Barclay can bring food to your room. It’s, like, you know, 30 feet away, but—
Griffin: You’re walking through the woods with Mama, sort of having this conversation, and her oil lantern and the moon overhead are the only light on your journey. And now you see—
Travis: Oh, is it? [makes fire noises]
Griffin: And the flames you’re producing with your hand.
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: And now you see the moonlight shining down on a clearing just in front of you, and there’s a carpet of pine needles on the forest floor, but they are distributed in a kind of peculiar pattern. They’re giving a wide berth to the clearing’s most eye-catching feature. There is a stone archway standing before you in the center of the clearing. It’s a humble structure, just two large slabs of stone with a third perched on top of it. And Mama clears her throat and she says:
Mama: Okay, this is gonna sound pretty strange, I reckon, but there’s somethin’ here that you cannot see right now. So don’t go runnin’ forward, cause I don’t want you to bash your face right into it, all right? And it’s gonna look like I’m just sort of speakin’ it into existence, but that’s not really—
Aubrey: The Stonehenge thing?
Mama: [long pause] You… you can already see it?
Aubrey: “In ancient times, hundreds of years before the dawn of history”… have you not seen Spinal Tap?
Griffin: She puts a hand on your shoulder, and she says:
Mama: Aubrey, I—that doesn’t make any sense. There’s—
Aubrey: It’s three rocks. Can you see it?
Griffin: She puts her hands in her temples, which is sort of the go-to move for any Adventure Zone NPC, and she says:
Mama: It is not supposed to work like this, Aubrey! There is— there’s supposed to be an enchantment on it that makes it so you can’t see it unless you know it’s there.
Aubrey: “Hewn into the living rock, of Stonehenge!” No? Nothing?
Griffin: You see her not responding to your—
Aubrey: ‘‘’Tis a magic place!”
Griffin: —to your japes. She’s pondering. Her face is, like, toward the ground. And then there’s a third light source shining into this scene from close by in the woods, and you hear a loud sound getting louder, moving quickly in your direction.
And Ned, Barclay’s in the front seat, and he’s surveying his wounds in the mirror, in the sun visor. And he does that for a few minutes, and then, as like, the Continental is rumbling over the occasional sort of root as it maneuvers through the woods, and then he flips the visor back up, and he slams a fist down on the dashboard, and he points forward with his other hand, and he yells:
Barclay: Look out!
Griffin: What do you do?
Clint: Well, obviously, I- I- do I need to do, like, an investigation, or an observation, thing?
Griffin: Um, not really. I mean, I can tell you, you don’t— you’re going through the pines, and so your vision is kind of occluded a bit, but you do not see anything in front of you.
Clint: Well, then, I slam on the brakes.
Griffin: I think this would— this would probably be a good Act Under Pressure roll.
Justin: To push— to press the brake pedal? How’s he gonna wang that?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Well, to slam on it with the proper, sort of, reaction time.
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh no, you hit the gas!
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: You do have a plus one, ‘cause you’re— it is a driving thing.
Clint: ‘Kay. Sev— eight!
Griffin: Eight. Uh, mixed success.
Justin: So he presses the brake pedal down halfway, and, like—
Griffin: You slam on it, uh—
Justin: And a Taco Bell cup gets stuck underneath and he careens into a tree. [Griffin laughing]
Griffin: Uh, I don’t know if there’s a Taco Bell in— in— yeah, there’s probably a Taco Bell.
Travis: It’s a combination Taco Bell-Pizza Hut-KFC.
Griffin: Thank you, thank you, thank you. There is a canon Pizza Hut.
Justin: Gas station.
Travis: Oh, yes.
Griffin: You slam on your brakes with pretty good reaction time, and as you do so, you enter this clearing, and you see a young woman with a sort of hip haircut, and a sort of larger, older woman wearing a big long duster, holding an oil lantern. And that’s all ya see! And you slam on the brakes, and the car starts to careen to a halt as you drive into this clearing, and you are moving pretty slowly when the car runs into something. And it’s weird, ‘cause there’s nothing there. It’s not a tremendous amount of damage to the car, the fender’s probably pretty busted up, but the car sputters to a halt as it collides with some sort of invisible shape. And Barclay looks at the two other people in this clearing, and he hops out of the car and his eyes lock with Mama. And Mama says:
Mama: Well… evenin’, Barclay.
Travis: And I want you to picture Aubrey waving, but her hand is on fire.
Griffin: Yeah.
Aubrey: Hi!
Griffin: Barclay says:
Barclay: Hi Mama, hi…
Aubrey: Aubrey!
Barclay: It’s, uh— hi, Aubrey?
Griffin: He looks, like, just as uncomfortable as he did when you first ran into him in the woods when you weren’t supposed to, Ned. And Mama says:
Mama: So, uh, what brings you out into the woods in the middle of the night with Ned fuckin’ Chicane, Barclay?
Ned: How did you know my middle name?
[Justin and Travis laugh]
Griffin: And Barclay says:
Barclay: He’s, uh, he’s seen a lot tonight, Mama. I think we’ve gotta tell—wait, wait, what are you doing in the woods with her?
Aubrey: Aubrey!
Barclay: Yeah!
Griffin: And Mama at this point looks like she’s about to, like, lose it. She is— things are going very, very— things are getting out of hand. And that’s, in fact she says, like:
Mama: All right, look. Things are getting a little bit outta hand tonight. We’ve kept this gate a secret for—
Griffin: And Ned, you can see the gate.
Ned: What gate—? Oh.
Griffin: Yeah, she says that and it just appears right in front of you, and you can see it sort of pressed into the fender of your Continental. It is—
Ned: Oh, shit. This is going to end up on a Farmers Insurance commercial, isn’t it?
Griffin: She notices you, like, now you can see the gate ‘cause she said that, and she didn’t even think about it, but now she knows that she’s sort of let this slip again, and she says:
Mama: Shit! All right, okay—that’s it, though! Ned, there’s powerful cosmic forces at work here, stuff that’s gotta stay out of the public eye! I don’t know if we can trust you, Ned fuckin’ Chicane, but I need you to trust me when I say that there’d be dire consequences if anyone else in Kepler found out about this gate in the woods. Do you understand me?
Griffin: [audibly grinning] And it’s at that point that the gate is, just for a moment, filled with light, and out steps Duck Newton. Duck, you are back in the woods, and here’s four people who are all kind of looking at you with shock. Especially Mama and Barclay. They look kind of dumbfounded and kind of horrified as you step foot back into Kepler.
Duck: Uh, I’m District Ranger Duck Newton, it’s a nickname, and, uh, ma’am, I’m going to need you to extinguish that flame, please.
Aubrey: Oh, yeah! [makes ‘pschoo’ noise]
Duck: Thank you very much.
Travis: And I also want to say, uh, Aubrey makes that sound when she does it. [makes ‘pschoo’ noise again]
Griffin: Mama looks at you, Duck, for a few seconds, just— her mouth agape in sort of disbelief at how quickly this situation has spiraled, and she says:
Mama: Duck. Newton. What the hell have you done?
Duck: I have absolutely no idea.
Griffin: [laughing] She says:
Mama: How did you see the— why did you go through the gate, Duck?
Duck: Well, I was bein’ chased by a spooky bear.
Clint: [Yogi Bear accent] “Hey there, it’s Spooky Bear!”
Griffin: She says:
Mama: A big, spooky bear, huh?
Griffin: And Barclay says:
Barclay: He’s, um, he’s not lyin’, Mama. Ned and I, we had a run in with… well, with part of the Abomination, I- I think. It’s complicated. We— we really should get hunting tonight.
Griffin: And Mama kind of sighs, and rubs her head, and she says:
Mama: But how did he find out about—[sigh] All right. Okay. Here’s the plan, everybody. Me and Barclay, we gotta pop through that gate for just a couple minutes, find out how much diplomatic damage Duck just wreaked over there, try to smooth it over. You three are gonna stay put right here. Don’t move a muscle, and when we get out, I can explain how much trouble the five of us are in back at the lodge.
Aubrey: Okay!
Griffin: And with that, Mama reaches into the interior pocket of her duster, and she pulls out this small compact mirror. She opens it up and she catches some of the moonlight above in it, and it reflects back onto the gate, which hums quietly. And Duck, you see that wind whipping off of the gate again, just before the span of the archway is filled with this white light. And Barclay steps through and disappears. And Mama turns to you, Aubrey, and she says:
Mama: I need you to have my back on this, all right? I need you to make sure these two chuckleheads don’t run off. We gotta keep this secret, remember?
Aubrey: Yeah! If they try to run off, I’ll… burn ‘em to the ground?
Mama: Well, don’t, no, don’t— come on.
Aubrey: Okay, no. I— even as I was saying it, I knew that it was too much.
Mama: Yeah, you realised it was bad.
{{42:41}}
Griffin: And Mama turns and steps through the gate, and the wind stops, and the light inside the archway disappears. And now it’s just the three of you standing in the middle of this clearing, in the middle of the woods, in the middle of the night.
{Ad break 43:09-48:20}
Ned: Welcome to my fucking awesome dream, Duck.
Duck: Well, I hate to break it to ya, I don’t think you are technically dreaming, Ned.
Ned: Huh? What?
Duck: Well unless it’s — unless it’s one of those shared dreams. I saw on Dr. Oz some people… anyways.
Ned: Oh I saw that one!
Duck: Yeah, shared dreams.
Ned: So you’re trying to tell me this is real?
Duck: Yeah it’s real as uh, I mean as far as I know it’s as real as anything.
Ned: Holy shit!
Aubrey: I mean “real” is really a relative term if you think about it.
Duck: Aw hey! I recognize you!
Aubrey: Yeah hi, Ranger Rick.
Duck: Well, it’s Duck…
Aubrey: Okay.
Ned: Hello!
Duck: I remember you you’re that um… ah, where was it? Over near Laurel Fork, right? I busted you for…
Aubrey: Sure.
Duck: What was it? Torch- Torch Girl? Was that it? I’m tryin’ to remember.
Aubrey: No it’s… The Lady Flame.
Duck: Lady Flame! That’s right.
Aubrey: I had the rabbit?
Duck: You uh… your hands were on fire, huh?
Aubrey: Yeah! Yeah, apparently I can do magic. Right?
Duck: Huh, sounds like a big night.
Aubrey: Yeah! I mean— yeah, right?
Duck: Can I ask, Ned? And I do expect some sort of recognition for waiting this long to sort of inquire, why is that you are dressed like a, the Chewbacca?
Aubrey: Oh yeah! That was the— I was trying to— I couldn’t put my finger on it.
Ned: Well I have some friends we get together and go see Star Wars but no— I was goofing around, I was trying to do a whole… Bigfoot thing and it’s hotter than shit. I’m going to take it off.
Duck: Dressed like a… like a yahoo?
Ned: Uh, yeah. I was dressed like a yahoo for a big old yahoo.
Duck: Haha, I get it. I get it.
Ned: Well I mean up until tonight I thought all this was horseshit.
Duck: Torch Girl you probably don’t know this but uh…
Aubrey: Lady Flame.
Duck: Sorry! Darnit.
Aubrey: You can just call me Aubrey if that’s easier?
Duck: You know what? I get confused between “Aubrey” and “Audrey” so much I’m gonna stick with Lady Flame, I think.
Aubrey: Okay.
Duck: But ‘round these parts we have a— the old timers call it “Yahoo Holler” ‘cause of the— they call ‘em— most people call ‘em “Bigfoots” but they call ‘em “Yahoos” ‘cause that’s…
Aubrey: Aah, the Sas-quatch!
Duck: Sasquatch, yeah.
Aubrey: The woodland ape!
Duck: Yeah, Sasquatch I guess.
Griffin: While this conversation’s happening, I like the scene of Ned sort of in the background trying to unzip the Wookiee costume and is like—
Ned: Little help please! Little help!
Griffin: —In the middle of stepping out of it, and suddenly there is a deep guttural sigh from the edge of the clearing, and the three of you turn to face it. And with the moon’s light above and the light from the oil lantern, which Mama set down right in front of the gate before she stepped through, there is no obscurity about the beast the three of you are facing just, like, 10 yards away. It is a horrible sight: eight feet tall and nearly as wide. And a roar comes from this beast, projected from the agonized face of a massive black bear. And Ned? You see that same sort of lifeless expression you that recognized in the bobcat earlier. [music fades in] Horrifyingly, you also see it on several other faces that are jutting out of this beast. A wolf’s face sits motionless on the neck of this creature. From its shoulder a stag’s head is, like, half submerged in its form and its antler is protruding sharply from the mass. A half dozen forest creatures are embedded in this thing. And not just their faces, this whole being is covered in their pelts, forming a thick patchwork hide all around it. The three of you survey this nightmare in an instant as it makes its presence known, and then it charges.
...What do you do?
This is our first sort of group combat thing and I want to make it clear that in this game there is no initiative. I don’t really roll, I can set up soft moves to set up, like, elements of danger for you all to respond to, but I don’t really get a turn to attack. My actions are all in response to you. And because there is no initiative the three of you kind of have to play fair and play collaboratively. If one of you takes a turn I kind of won’t let you go again until the other two also take an action— but in terms of, y’know, who goes first and who does what and in what order? It’s up to you guys to decide and you kind of need to keep in mind what is going to be the most narratively interesting and set each other up and help each other out. It’s pretty loosey-goosey. So with that in mind, what do you do?
Travis: How far away is the bear?
Griffin: It was 10 yards away. Getting closer.
Clint: Ned reaches into the trunk of the Lincoln and pulls out the big heavy walking stick. It’s got a huge— it almost looks like a drum major’s baton from marching band.
Griffin: It’s got a thing at the end?
Clint: Yeah, great big heavy metal brass knob at the end of it and he says:
Ned: Duck!
Clint: Which he realizes now, if he does, everybody’s gonna duck.
Justin: And they do.
Clint: Says it anyways and so he throws it and it goes sailing over Duck’s head ‘cause he ducked.
Justin: No, I caught it.
Clint: It lands— no.
Justin: I caught it. I’m used to it.
Griffin: Yeah, I won’t make you roll for that. I think you toss Duck the weapon. Do you do anything else? Sort of with your action here?
Clint: I start rummaging through the trunk ‘cause I got another idea. But as long as I’m at the trunk I think that enabling— enabling Duck will accomplish what I wanna do. You want me to roll?
Griffin: No! No, I think we can figure out— you have gear that is like on your starting character sheet, and if you’re looking for something else that’s cool and we will get to that here in a little bit.
Clint: He starts rummaging through the trunk.
Griffin: Alright, Duck, you catch the walking stick. We’ll go to you next before we get to Aubrey. What do you do?
Justin: Can you lay out the scene for me? Like, positioning-wise, what's going on?
Griffin: Yeah, I mean, the three of you are pretty close. You got your back basically to this arch, with the oil lantern laying on the ground and the Continental kind of busted up a little bit in the side of the arch. Which, by the way, I should mention the archway was not even remotely damaged, or seemingly affected at all, by your car crashing into it. The beast is now, like, five yards away from you guys and is sort of charging right— right at you, towards you and the archway, and you're holding the walking stick.
Justin: Alright. Duck scoops up the lantern and then runs around to the other side of the gate and starts yelling at the monsters.
Duck: Woo-hoo! Come here! Come on, dum-dums! Right over here!
Justin: Making a lot of noise and trying to get them to charge straight at him.
Griffin: I love it! I think this would be an Act Under Pressure roll. Like you're trying to do someth— fuck it, you’re under pressure and you’re acting. Like this is explicitly that. So…
Justin: Let's see… eight!
Griffin: Eight! A mixed success, okay, alright. I think that the trade off here is— with a mixed success you do what you're trying to do, and I know what you're trying to do, but there is a slight cost to it. So you are taunting this creature to run right at you and it does and it slams right into the gate which it does not see. And as it does so, it sort of— you hear it sort of whine in pain as it does. But that— the antlers in its shoulder kind of goes through the gate and you were just a little bit closer, you did not expect it to have that much reach, and those antlers just get you for— I mean they jab right into you, for three harm.
Justin: Eugh, one harm…
Clint: What happened to Invincible? Oh right, two…
Griffin: Yeah he has two armor which like negates some of it. And the beast, I think, takes— takes two harm. Well, it would take two harm but for whatever reason this plan went, y'know, perfectly how you kind of envisioned it. It was a very good Punk’d you did to this big beast. But it didn't do quite as much damage as you were expecting, almost as if like this thing is also pretty tough right now. And it kind of wedges itself out backward from the gate, and we will jump to Aubrey.
Travis: Aubrey grabs the lantern from Duck and throws it at the creature's face.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: It is still lit, correct?
Griffin: Oh, it’s lit as hell.
Travis: Excellent.
Griffin: I don’t think you’d need to roll for this. This is not, you know— If you’re throwing a lantern at it, maybe you just Act Under Pressure, but I think you just do it.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: I’m trying to follow the rules here and I feel like this is not a traditional… it’s not Kick Some Ass, right? You were throwing a lantern at the thing. If anything it’s Act Under Pressure.
Travis: And it’s very close, right, at this point.
Griffin: It’s real close and it’s huge. I think you can pretty confidently throw this oil lantern at the thing. All right, you chuck the oil lantern at its face. You don’t have to roll, this is not a fight thing. This is just you doing something very clever. The oil lantern shatters as it hits the beast’s face, and the oil sort of covers it like at least the top portion of it, and the fire quickly spreads and that pelt, that patchwork pelt which you can kind of see, like, that black slime that you saw earlier, Ned, is kind of like holding it together a little bit like glue. This pelt is now just ablaze. It’s ablaze because it’s now covered in burning oil but it also just seems like it is just very flammable, almost, ‘cuz this thing just goes up and it is on fire and it takes three harm as this fire is spreading all around it, and it looks pretty enraged. And I think with that, Aubrey, it is going to look at you and kind of roar, because it knows that you just set it on fire.
Travis: Shit!
Griffin: And now it is charging at you. This is a soft move. It’s not me saying I’m gonna do some damage, but now there is some danger going on.
Clint: Ned has found what he’s looking for in the trunk.
Griffin: All right.
Clint: It’s that great big jug, and when she yelled “shit” just a minute ago, that reminded him. It’s that great big jug that he filled from the septic tank, with all that nasty shit.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: And animal droppings and everything else.
Griffin: I did not know that that fluid was as gross as you’re describing.
Clint: Aw, it’s really gross.
Travis: So wait, in the septic tank, animals have been using your toilet too?
Clint: Well everything says, it’s not a very effective septic tank…
Griffin: It’s a service the Cryptonomica provides, where animals can come and use their toilet.
Clint: And also I’ve been dumping all this shit in there— I’m not a very good homeowner.
Griffin: You’re a real fuckin’ cousin Randy from Christmas Vacation.
Justin: Eddie, Eddie.
Griffin: Cousin Eddie, thank you.
Clint: Yeah, well, he’s got a lip fungus we ain’t identified yet. Ned grabs this jug, runs over and throws it in the air. It’s arcing towards the path in front of the beast, and it hits the ground and shatters and this horrible stench, this horrible stink and all of this stuff splatters all over the place, and Ned says:
Ned: Huh. No methane. Well, it was a great idea.
Griffin: I think this thing— you were trying to create some sort of literal stink bomb, which I appreciate.
Clint: I think, yeah, a little napalm.
Griffin: But I think that something kinda curious happens. This thing was about to come down on Aubrey, but as this jug of, you said there was like animal droppings and stuff in it?
Clint: Oh yeah.
Griffin: As this thing smells, like, picks up the scent of a bunch of different animals, even though it is on fire and even though it is about to attack this thing that is endangering it, it’s almost like this more primary instinct kicks in. And you see it whip its head around and look toward the direction of the jug, and now it’s sniffing around almost like a hunter who has just like picked up the trail of its prey. And you have definitely definitely, accidentally it sounds like, sort of distracted it away from its attack. What do you all do?
Travis: Aubrey’s gonna do some magic.
Griffin: All right. This is your magic attack or do you just do magic?
Travis: Well, one of the things that I can do, of one of the effects I can do is Enchant a Weapon, and it gets plus one harm and plus magic, so I am going to… this is my logic. The fire hurt the thing. Duck is standing there holding a weapon. I’m going to enchant it, set it on fire.
Griffin: All right.
[Clint laughs, Travis rolls]
Travis: That’s a seven plus two, so nine.
Griffin: Yep, that’s a mixed success.
Justin: She sets it on fire, but then it burns Duck’s hands and he drops it.
Griffin: Okay, the walking stick is on fire. It is also made out of wood. So it is on fire and it is enchanted, and what does that do, it gives it plus one magic attack?
Travis: It’s plus one harm and says plus magic, which I don’t…
Griffin: Yeah. So there’s a system of tags that comes on every single item in this game, and it just sort of informs the fiction. So if there’s a monster that could only be hurt by magic, so for instance, like a ghost or something who couldn’t be hit by a physical weapon, but a magical weapon could actually harm it. Then, if something has the magic tag, then you’re good to go. So you have set this walking stick on fire, but it is also made out of wood, so if it stays like this for a long time it’s going to be gone. But Duck, you can safely hold it.
Justin: Well, I guess I’m gonna kick some ass.
Griffin: Hell yeah.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: Roll 2d6.
Justin: I’m gonna slam the, I’m aiming to just slam the, uh, thing right down on its noggin.
[Justin rolls]
Justin: Oh shit! That is a 13!
Griffin: Jesus Christ, these rolls.
Justin: I rolled 2d6— two sixes.
Clint: Yeah, sure did. Plus since the gear had a one harm hand.
Griffin: It actually has two harm ‘cuz it was enchanted.
Clint: Cool.
Griffin: And it was enchanted with fire, so on a 10-plus, choose one effect. You gain the advantage, take plus one forward, or give plus one forward to another hunter. You inflict terrible harm, plus one harm. You suffer less harm, minus one harm. Or you force them where you want them. So you get to pick one effect in addition to the two sort of fiery magical damage that you are also dealing.
Justin: Okay, I guess I’m just gonna inflict an additional harm then.
Griffin: All right.
Justin: I was trying to preserve it somehow, ‘cuz I feel like that would be Duck’s instinct. Be he also, he’s not a doofus, like this is obviously—
Clint: Yeah, preserve us first.
Justin: An imminent danger to these other people.
Griffin: So on a kick-ass, on a Kick Some Ass the way this works is both of you deal damage. So describe what you do again.
Justin: I’m just… the lantern, the oil is on his head as well right?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Like that’s where I would be aiming for. One of the heads? Are there multiple heads?
Griffin: The way this thing is, it’s got this main bear head. It kind of almost has the body of bear, sort of, but a huge one, with all these other animals kind of absorbed into it.
Clint: Like their faces?
Griffin: Like all their bodies and stuff.
Justin: Alright yeah, so I’m aiming for the bear head.
Griffin: Alright you clobber this, you bring the flaming brass tip of this walking stick down on top of the bear’s skull. And you hear this, sort of, if you’ll pardon the pun, grisly crack as you do so, and this thing takes three harm as you bash into it, thanks to all of your different bonuses. And it sort of whips around as you do that, and it catches you with the horns again, and this time it kind of like picks you up and knocks you back a few feet. You keep your footing, but it sort of hits you real hard with these antlers for another three harm.
Justin: Damn.
Griffin: So, by my calculations…
Justin: Fuck, that hurts.
Griffin: You’ve taken two harm at this point.
Justin: Correct.
Griffin: And once you get to four, things start getting very very serious, but you’re not quite there yet. All right, here’s what happens next.
The three of you at this point have sort of independently experienced something profound in this moment. You have been confronted with death itself. With a monstrosity that defies every known natural order of this world. And yet your instinct was not that of absolute fear, as it would be for any other human who encountered this beast, you stood your ground and you fought. And maybe you knew why you’re fighting and maybe you didn’t, but regardless you all have this remarkable feeling, a kind of inexplicable assurance, that you can do this.
And then Ned, you feel something fall and tap on your shoulder, and Aubrey you feel it too, in your hair, kind of dripping cold down the back of your neck. And Duck, you see the trees start to sway, in a manner you’ve seen countless times during your patrols of these woods. And there’s a peal of thunder overhead, and then the skies open up.
And this sudden storm is bashing against the roof of the Continental, and it douses the flames that were spreading across the beast, which looks up at the sky and then, with otherworldly malice, back down at the three of you.

Griffin: Previously, on The Adventure Zone…
Mama: Where these gates appear on Earth so do the, we call ‘em, Abominations.
Vincent: I’m just as eager to avoid a war between our worlds as the next Sylph, so you gotta promise me Duck, you gotta forget this night ever happened.
Mama: We’ve kept this gate a secret for—
Griffin: And Ned, you can see the gate right in front of you, and you can see it sort of pressed into the fender of your Continental.
Ned: Shit.
Griffin: The three of you survey this nightmare in an instant, and then it charges.
Travis: Aubrey grabs the lantern from Duck and throws it at the creature's face.
Griffin: As this thing picks up the scent of a bunch of different animals, you see it whip its head around and look toward the direction of the jug, and there's a peal of thunder overhead, and then the skies open up and it douses the flames that were spreading across the beast, which looks up at the sky and then back down at the three of you.

{01:48}
[Faint rain ambiance]
Griffin: So the rain is coming down in sheets, nearly to the point where the three of you are having trouble seeing this beast that is right in front of you. You see a faint plume of steam rising off of it where that fire that was spreading across its patchwork pelt was doused, and through that steam, the three of you faintly see another shape behind the monster, and actually, as you look around, you notice that these shapes are surrounding you at the edge of the clearing. It's more woodland creatures, all seemingly possessed in the same way that you saw, Ned, in that bobcat. You count eight animals in total surrounding—
Travis: [imitating The Count] “Eight! Eight animals!”
Justin: That's a classic bit of course, long time listeners know any time there's a number on the show, we kind of do that bit.
Griffin: Which makes it tricky everytime we roll dice, or like every other sentence. There's like a smaller black bear prowling towards you, there's a couple other bobcats, there's a deer, and just a handful of other animals all slowly walking in your direction beckoned by the pained roars of that beast that you were just fighting, and as they're approaching, a light flashes from the archway, and suddenly, there's Barclay and Mama, and without a second of hesitation, Mama retrieves her sawed off shotgun from her duster and shoots two shells into the side of the big beast, who surprisingly doesn't look terribly damaged by the gunfire, but kind of roars reflexively and turns toward Mama. But then there's another light, this time in the distance deeper in the woods. There's another vehicle hastening towards your location, and sensing danger, the beast roars again, and those animals that were surrounding you spring toward it, and in kind of grisly display, they seem to leap into the beast, who absorbs them into its form before leering one last time in your party's direction and then dashes away into the woods. And just mere seconds after the monster disappears, that vehicle that you heard rolls to a stop at the edge of the clearing and Duck, you recognise it as a response vehicle from the Monongahela National Forest Service, and real quickly like before anything else happens, Mama says under her breath:
Mama: Nobody say a word about this stuff. Please, I’m begging you.
Griffin: And from out of the forest wagon, steps Ranger Juno Devine, your coworker, Duck.
Travis: And owner of the coolest name in town.
Griffin: She deploys an umbrella and jogs toward you, and she shouts:
Juno: Ranger Newton, what the heck's going on, buddy? Why'd you call me in?
Travis: Now Griffin, is it a magical umbrella?
Griffin: [amused] No, it's just a reg— I mean all umbrellas are magical if you think about the sort of incredible purpose they serve. I want to be clear that this is a result of you calling in somebody on your radio as you were running through the woods. This is sort of a reaction to the action that you took.
Duck: Well hey Juno, thanks for coming out so quick. You know, honestly, stories don't come much sillier than this, but we had a sorta, I guess you could say, bear attack, and you know me, gets late at night, I get a little jumpy, and I thought it was something a little bit worse than that. I was honestly as fearful for the animal itself as my own sort of safety, you know, animal— dealing with animals is always a tricky business, so I called you in, but I guess, you know, in hindsight, maybe I overreacted a little bit.
Juno: Well, you're pursued by a black bear? That doesn't sound really like their MO.
Duck: Juno, that's what spooked me about the whole thing, it was very aggressive, I mean you do not see that in the species, especially around these parts, because there’s so many people, you know, they tend to get, uh, almost a little too comfortable with humans. So I just wasn't used to the behavior, and I think that's kind of what got me a little jumpy if I'm being honest.
Griffin: She turns sorta towards everybody else, and she's like:
Juno: So what are y'all doing here? Did you antagonise this bear or somethin’? Did y’all— Were y'all tryin’ to do a fun Winnie the Pooh joke that turned horrible? What-what's the story, what are y'all doin out here?
Aubrey: We were just practicing, um, community theater. Do you know A Midsummer Night's Dream?
Juno: Yeah, I'm familiar with the works of Bill.
Aubrey: Yeah, we were just working to get into the character of the mechanicals, out in the woods practicing, you know, basic stuff.
Juno: So that's great if it weren't raining cats and dogs right now, I might ask if I could sit in and watch, that's one of my favorites, I like—
Aubrey: Well, you know, it started raining and we were about to head in, and that's when Ranger—Newton, was it?—came through, and I think the bear saw all the people here and got a little spooked and ran right back into the woods.
Duck: Yeah, that's literally the only time anyone's ever been helped by community theater. [Griffin laughs] It was a miracle, honestly, and I was so relieved that I could be here for this momentous occasion.
Ned: Of course that's why that fursuit over there hanging out of the back of the trunk of my car, because I'm a character actor, and I believe in, you know, embracing all aspects of it.
Griffin: She notices the car, but obviously does not see the archway, and I think the damage to the car is like surface level enough that it doesn't even register that it ran into, something, and Juno says:
Juno: Yeah, you know, I might have to write you up for this, you're really supposed to stick to the roads and the trails. You shouldn't really be driving your car through the woods, especially not in like a four-wheel drive vehicle, like… what is that, a Continental?
Ned: Lincoln Continental, yes, Lincoln Continental Mark 3, I hope you like it.
Juno: Yeah it's great. Well Ranger Newton, we should probably head back and write this up. Any y'all want a ride back to Kepler? Are y'all all right?
Ned: Um, I can drive, my car's okay. I think it's drivable and I'll be very careful, I'll just retrace my path so that I don't tear up any more of the woodland beauty.
Travis: Aubrey looks to Mama for kind of a lead here.
Griffin: Yeah, Mama says:
Mama: You know, I think we're probably just gonna walk back to the lodge, it's pretty close. I need to work on my lines for the, um, part, the part I'm playing in the play.
Aubrey: She's Peter Quince in the play.
Mama: Yes, that's me, we're having a lot of fun with it, so I'll head back. Aubrey we still have a room ready for you if you want to come with me.
Aubrey: Sounds great.
Griffin: And you all start to walk off in the other direction. Duck are you going with Juno back to the station, or what's your plan?
Justin: Yeah, you know what, I can't think of a good reason why I would go with Ned, as much as that probably seems like it would advance the story [Justin and Griffin laugh] a little better than me—
Clint: We're friends!
Justin: —departing from the three of them.
Griffin: Alright, you all start to— Juno goes back in her car, and you see her turn on the light inside her car and start writing some stuff down in a notepad, taking some notes about this bear attack, there's some paperwork to do. And as everybody else starts walking towards the edge of the clearing, and Ned you get in your car and it starts, and Mama turns towards everybody and she says:
Mama: If y'all wouldn't mind, could you swing by the lodge tomorrow around noon? Barclay'll cook you up some lunch. I got something I need to pitch you all.
Duck: Yeah, that's fine.
Aubrey: I'll be there anyways, so like, yeah?
Mama: Ok, I was mostly talking to the other two, [Aubrey: Oh!] but…
Griffin: And with that, you all start making your way back through the forest towards town, and the storm kind of dissipates just as quickly as it appears, and you all sort of make your way back through the forest with the strange events of this evening sort of rattling around your heads. And, we'll jump forward now, and Aubrey, you've settled into your room in Amnesty Lodge for the evening, and just as Mama promised, the accommodations are pretty nice. There's a soft queen sized bed, and next to it, there's a small round cushion where Dr. Bonkers is already fast asleep, and he's got a little bowl of diced carrots right in front of him, which we assume—
Travis: Now here’s the thing, Griffin, I wanna say, I've spoken with some people recently, carrots are a good treat for rabbits, like cake, [Griffin: Ohh!] but not a meal, you wouldn't feed— there's a lot of sugar in carrots.
Griffin: Interesting, so what's the rabbit eats?
Travis: That I don't know, maybe pellet [Clint laughs] let's assume that there's like rabbit food that Aubrey has.
Griffin: Yeah, all right, there's some rabbit food dished out in the bowl.
Travis: I didn't research that far, just enough to say like, ""Don't just straight up [crosstalk] feed them carrots all the time.”
Griffin: [crosstalk] Give them carrots all the time. Yeah, also turns orange, but the eyesight gets almost too good actually.
Travis: So terrifyingly good.
Griffin: So you assume that Dani did a pretty great job rabbit-sitting here. And so you're in this room, and you've kicked off your boots, and you're preparing to settle in, and there's a soft knock at the door, and Mama pokes her head in, and she says:
Mama: Hey, sorry to bother you, I just— I need to ask you something. Can you think of anything, anything at all from your past that seems strange, like the way the things you saw tonight were strange? Like some sort of weird portal in your basement? [crosstalk] Or a visit from a sorcerer or somethin?
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah, now that you mention it, there was that time when Hell poured into my b— what the fuck are you [slightly laughing] talking about? No!
Mama: No, I know, listen, I know this is— what is happening here is uncommon, but you have some sort of connection to all of this already, and I'm just tryin to figure out what that is, Aubrey. So any weird runes etched in stone in your backyard in the house you grew up in? Any— just do me a favor and think about it, and if there's nothing, that's fine, I'm trying to make everything make sense.
Aubrey: Hm, no, I-I, um, n— I mean listen, my family, it's about as boring as can be, I mean it's one of those “keep this between us, okay?” Old money, but the money's not there anymore, but the name, old money history, that kind of thing. But it's about as bland as bland can be— I mean that's on my mom's side, but I mean my dad— my dad is not that, and so when he and my mom married, we kind of fell out of touch with the family, and then I fell out of touch with my parents, and so like not that I remember, but I don't really know that much about my family past my mom and dad.
Mama: There's gotta be a source for this stuff, I just, I'm sorry for grillin' you, I'm just trying to figure out what it is.
Aubrey: [amused] Grillin'? Ah-ah, like fire?
Mama: I mean, there's probably gonna be a lot of that from now on, huh?
Aubrey: Yeah! A lot of me acknowledging that it might be a pun.
Mama: I guess— I guess if you can't think of anything, that's fine, it's just that, I want you to rack your brain, if there's something in your past, something you ever came in contact with that had something that you couldn't quite explain.
Aubrey: Well, um, there was, well, there was the necklace.
Mama: Alright, you had a cool necklace? What was— what was that about?
Aubrey: Um, I mean, it's just kind of the one thing my mom took with her when she fell out with the family, the Flamebright Pendant, and—
Mama: Now Aubrey, it's called the Flamebright Pendant, and you didn't think that that was germane?
Aubrey: Well I- right now, right now, in this se— it's something, you know, I heard so much in my— but I don't have it, I’m not wearing it, it's gone.
Mama: Where'd it go?
Aubrey: Stolen.
Mama: Well ain't that just peachy.
Aubrey: Yeah, yeah, that was the shit, so like I didn't think about it, it's not like I'm wearing it, it's not like it's warm against my skin as I cast my bewitching magicks.
Mama: Yeah, that's fine and everything. All right. I'll try to find out what I can about it, you get some sleep. I got a project I'm gonna need some help with tomorrow.
Aubrey: Like crafting?
Mama: Somethin’ like that.
Griffin: And she slips back out the door. Ned, you pull your car, just a little bit worse for wear, in front of the Cryptonomica, and you see a light inside still on, and as you head in, you see Kirby,
Justin: [singing] There's a light on, over at the—
Griffin: You see Kirby with a mop and a bucket cleaning up a puddle on the floor near one of the displays, and as the bell above the doors rings as you enter, he looks up at you, and then back down at his work and he says:
Kirby: Roof's leaking again. How'd it go out there?
Ned: Um, not entirely as expected, but I would have to say the views of monsters was, um, the best, ever. [Justin snorts] I hope I actually got some— some good footage.
Kirby: It's late, we don't have to worry about that tonight.
Griffin: And he puts the mop in the bucket and starts to wheel it away, and just as he does so, another trickle of water drips down at a different spot in the room, and Kirby kind of sighs, and he walks over to it and he puts the bucket underneath it to catch the water, and he says:
Kirby: Ned, I don't wanna sound ungrateful, but I gotta ask, why on God's green earth did you decide to open this tourist trap here in the middle of nowhere?
Ned: Um, well, I didn't really open it, Kirby, I— I kind of, um, found it? [sighs] You see, I was, I got in a little bit of trouble in my not-so-shiny past, and made a friend. And that friend said perhaps I would want to avoid my trouble by coming here to this lovely community, and kind of- taking a prolonged vacation from my trouble, and this was actually her establishment. I, of course, I contributed some, I jazzed it up some, brought a little joie de vivre to it, a little flair so to speak—
Kirby: As you bring to everything.
Griffin: He kind of chuckles.
Ned: And so um, she— she went away, and now I'm stuck with it, and stuck with the mortgage, and apparently stuck with an eviction notice, and stuck, just stuck.
Griffin: He kind of sighs, and sets the mop down in the corner with the bucket still catching water in the middle of the room and he says:
Kirby: Yeah, I know that feeling.
Griffin: And he collects the like dozen or so empty cans of RC Cola up off his desks and he drops them in a recycling bin and he picks up his old Macbook and he walks towards the door and he says:
Kirby: I'll see you tomorrow, Ned.
Ned: See you too, Kirby. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll uh— we've got what, like 30 days left before we're evicted?
Griffin: I think you have one week is what we established, six days.
Ned: Well, I'll tell you what, in that six days, I'll contact the landlord and tell him he can fix the damn roof, and at least maybe we won't get rained on in seven days. So wait a minute, I'm writing a note to myself on a post-it. [to himself] Call Mr. Garfield-
Griffin: No, come on, you don't get the— you don't get to wield the power of the Garfield insert. [Clint laughs] He says:
Kirby: I'm not worried about it, Ned, you've always been pretty resourceful.
Griffin: And with the ring of the bell, Kirby walks out the door. Duck, you are, uh, you’ve finished your work for the evening, your shift is over, and you’re back at your, your place in Kepler. What— what’s your place, where do you live in Kepler?
Justin: I have a—
Travis: Bungalow.
Justin: Apartment. Yeah. But it’s a nice apartment.
Griffin: Ok. One bedroom? Studio?
Justin: It’s like— Uh, two bedrooms. One is sort of—
Griffin: Whoa!
Justin: I know! One’s a bedroom, and then I have an office where I, uh, mainly do my, uh, ship building, my model ships—
Griffin: Hell yeah!
Justin: And, uh, that’s kind of all that happens in the office, really. It’s kind of where I go to like unwind, um, but— and then I’ve got a bunch of, you know, exotic animal heads from all my big game hunting—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Jesus, no. No, no.
Justin: [crosstalk] That’s right, twist! What a twist! [Clint laughing] No one saw this coming!
Griffin: Veto, blackball.
Justin: No, I have a lot of paintings of wildlife put up around the— the house, some commendations from the park service for distinguished service, that kind of thing. And— you know, it’s a nice place. It’s not— it’s not sad, it’s nice.
Griffin: Good. Okay, so you’re in your bathroom brushing your teeth and you finish up and take a look—
Justin: If someone has to say their apartment is not sad, it probably is, right?
[Travis and Clint laughing]
Griffin: Uh, you finish up brushing and you take a look in the bathroom mirror and— and you turn, and you shut out the light, and you close the bathroom door behind you, and as you enter your bedroom, there she is again. That vision, that faint blue silhouette of the woman who talked to you in the woods earlier tonight. And she’s— she’s standing still between you and the bed, and she’s not really moving.
Justin: [sighs] Ditto, would I know this thing’s name from, like, previous encounters, or whatever?
Griffin: Yeah, I think we should set that up, just because it’s getting to the point where just referring to it as “the vision” is kind of strange, also a little confusing because people might think I’m talking about the comic book hero—
Travis: And you are, that’s the thing!
Griffin: And you are, that’s the twist. No, it’s, uh, I think you used to have a lot more contact with her when you were younger, and so just to, like, be cordial in the way that Duck is cordial, you wanted to know her name, and back then, she introduced herself as Minerva.
Justin: Minerva. Okay.
Griffin: Um, but she’s just kind of standing in front of you, not really moving, and doesn’t really seem to acknowledge you as you enter the room.
Clint: Who you gonna call?
Griffin: Well don’t bust— don’t bust Minerva, that’s—
Justin: No, I’m not gonna do that.
Duck: Well… god. Hey, Minerva.
Justin: And I walk through her towards bed.
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: Um, you do that and you just phase right through her and head to bed. And as you do, she doesn’t respond. Um, she doesn’t respond with speech, and she doesn’t seem to be, like, moving. She looks actually like, frozen in place. Uh, she has like one of her arms, like, half-raised, the other one’s kind of at her side and she’s just frozen and static. And as you sort of, like, realise that she’s not, uh, responding at all, you maybe get a little bit confused. And as you look at her standing perfectly still in the center of your room, you do start to hear something. [music (All Night Long by Lobo Loco) begins playing] You hear music coming from Minerva. Old, like, kind of tinny, distorted music coming from her form, and it’s like a sad and beautiful acoustic blues tune? One that you don’t really recognise, but the music is moving and for a minute or so, it’s all you hear, just reverberating around your bedroom, before, in the blink of an eye, Minerva fades away.
{23:37}
[guitar fades out, new song fades in]
{23:47}
Griffin: So it’s tomorrow at noon, and the three of you, at Mama’s behest, have gathered in the lobby of the Amnesty Lodge. Aubrey, you stayed the night here and Ned, you said you’ve been here before, but Duck, the scene here is so unbelievably quaint as you enter. The windows are all— uh, around the lobby are all half open, letting in a nice breeze, and you see Barclay through the kitchen window working over a large pot with a hairnet on, and the smell coming from the kitchen is incredible. Um, there’s a few guests in the lobby just enjoying the day. Jake Cool-Ice is sitting with his snowboard on a table, just meticulously waxing it—
Travis: Have we established what kind of creature Jake Cool-Ice is when he’s at home?
Griffin: Uh, no, but we’ll get to it. They—
Travis: Oh, I can’t wait to find out.
Griffin: They’re all— they’re also in human form right now. There is a young woman sitting at a piano just jotting down something on some sheet music. Dani is in the corner with a large sketchpad in her lap, doing some kind of charcoal drawing. And everybody here just seems so at ease. And Mama comes into the lobby and greets the three of you and says:
Mama: Uh, Duck, Ned, thank you for coming, and Aubrey, I guess, thanks for staying. I— I have something grave I need to discuss with you in my office, and— oh, right, I promised you some food. D’jy’all eat yet?
Aubrey: No?
Travis: Griffin, have we eaten yet? Should we roll to see if we ate?
Griffin: Yeah, roll the hunger dice, that’s a special dice that I mailed each of you. It’s a two-sided dice.
Travis: I got a 9?
Duck: I’m starvin’, thank you.
Ned: Me too.
Griffin: Ok. And Barclay kinda hears you say that you’re starving and he nods from the kitchen, and Mama smiles and leads the three of you into her office, down one of those hallways off the lobby. And her office is a mess. There’s like— there’s like five bookcases, all hand-crafted, of different shapes and materials, all loaded with these big, like, historical tomes and books on folklore for various regions. There’s a couch against one wall that is just covered with maps, mostly of the Monongahela Forest. Her desk is similarly covered with books and maps, and a ledger filled with paperwork for the lodge that’s just sort of sandwiched between the pages of the ledger, and her desk also has a few empty mugs on it. And at the center of her office is a large round table, also hand-crafted by the look of it, with several chairs around it. And as you all walk into the room, Mama enters behind you and she locks the door behind her and she says:
Mama: So, how was everyone’s night?
Aubrey: It was fine.
Duck: Uh, a little shitty, if I’m being honest.
Ned: I realised this is not a nightmare when I woke up again, so... I had a fitful night’s sleep.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: Yeah, it’s not a nightmare. There’s, um, there’s a lot going on we should probably sort of—
Aubrey: I slept great!
Mama: Well that’s— yeah, I was hoping you would.
Aubrey: Full six hours.
Mama: That’s, uh, I mean. People say they recommend eight, but I get by on, like, four, but you know I’m spinning a lot of plates. Um, let’s—
Ned: Mama— Mama, what’s your secret? What is your secret, Mama?
Justin: Let’s take a deep dive into your sleep patterns.
Ned: What is your secret, Mama?
Mama: I just drink a lot of water during the day, and it gets—
Ned: No, I mean, here we are, let’s face it, Kepler, not exactly the, uh, you know, the gay Paris (said with the French pronunciation, Pah-ree) of the ski set, and I haven’t seen three customers in three months, and yet your lobby out there is packed! You’ve got people all over the place, they’re writing music and they’re waxing their skateboards, and everything else [Travis: With their hula hoops and their rock music!] What is your secret? Are you online, [others laugh] do you have some kind of deal with Yelp? What is the— what is your secret?
Griffin: She says, um,
Mama: Yeah, I opened up a— I got someone to open up a Yelp page for me a couple years back, [Ned: Ah, I knew it] but that’s, um, that’s not really where most of my… industry lies. We should, um—
Duck: More TripAdvisor? [Ned: Oohh.] Yeah, I heard they’re coming up in the ranks.
Ned: Retirees? Are they bus people?
Griffin: She says,
Mama: Why don’t you— why don’t y’all pull up a seat, and I can kinda get y’all on the same page.
Griffin: So you all sit around this, this table in the center of Mama’s office, and she catches everyone up on what she told Aubrey during the last evening about Sylvane, and the Sylphs and the Lodge, and the— the arch in the woods that these abominations cross over from into our world. Duck, do you tell everybody about sort of your experience in Sylvane that night?
Justin: No.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I promised I wouldn’t.
Griffin: Okay, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Travis: Duck knows how to keep his lips shut.
Griffin: Cool. Um, so Mama says,
Mama: All right. And so— so these Abominations, the— what you’ve got to understand is that the Sylphs—
Aubrey: Seems mean.
Mama: Well—
Duck: It is a little judgey.
Mama: I’m not talking about— I’m not talking about everybody that comes over from—
Aubrey: No, I know, but I mean… you know, like, I don’t know, it just seems mean. “Abomination?” Ugh.
Mama: I mean, they— that was their term for them, not ours, but I mean, in their defense, they do pretty abominable shit. Um—
Aubrey: Yeah, but I mean, what is— what is social, you know—
Mama: Ok. What would you prefer to call these [crosstalk] big, deadly monsters?
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Nom-noms.
Mama: No, we’re not gonna call them nom-noms.
Ned: Bom-boms!
Aubrey: Bom-boms?
Duck: Goombas?
Ned: Goombas!
Duck: No, Abomination fits, I got my butt kicked by one last night, [crosstalk] it’s on the level.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Ok, but in my head, I’m gonna say bom-boms.
Duck: Ok, just so long as you don’t vocalize it—
Aubrey: I can’t promise that.
Griffin: Uh, she says,
Mama: What you’ve gotta understand about these— about the “bom-boms” is that the Syl—
Aubrey: Thank you!
Duck: No, now, don’t—
Mama: Ok, the Abominations—
Duck: I can’t push back by myself.
Mama: What you’ve gotta understand about these… things, is that the Sylphs— they don’t claim credit for them, they swear up and down they don’t know where they’re coming from. They— they don’t originate in their world, despite the fact that they come through the gate into ours. But wherever they come from, the fact remains that they show up at our door, and they try to make a mess of things. And obviously that’s not gonna happen.
Aubrey: Can I ask you a question, Mama? In your experience with the— things?
Mama: Yes.
Aubrey: Is it just, like, they come in and they are chaotic, or are— are they trying— do they want something?
Mama: I mean, that’s what makes it a li’l bit tricky, is that they— they have sort of different impulses. They got different, um, different instincts. And figuring those out is sort of part of the process, but it’s an important thing to do, cause we can’t let the folks of this fine town live in fear of some big monsters lookin’ to do them harm, and Sylvane doesn’t want that either — some monster comes over here and makes headlines, and some far less understanding, far less patient folks are gonna make a beeline to Sylvane and rain hellfire down on ‘em in return, and that’s a war that neither of our worlds can afford. So— so by our estimate, gate showed up in Kepler back in ‘88, and quickly— some of us realised what the deal was, what we were up against, why we had to keep it a secret, and I was one of those folks what had that realization, and I’ve been fighting them ever since.
Now these days it’s just me and Barclay doing the fight, and some of the guests here, they have— they got some idea of the score, but our numbers have dwindled and for obvious reasons, it’s a tough gig to hire for. The repercussions of bringing someone on with loose lips would be… and I’m not being hyperbolic here, it would be apocalyptic. But y’all know the truth now, and by my counting you’ve kept it to yourself for like 12 hours, and that ain’t nothing, so. Yeah, I’m asking for your help to defend this town and this world and Sylvane.
Griffin: And she goes to her desk and opens up a drawer and she pulls something out and walks over to the three of you and places this object that she retrieved down in front of you, and you see, sitting on this hand crafted table, is a circular patch, a sew-in patch, crafted with shimmering Sylvan wool, depicting a tall, green pine tree standing in front of a sunset-hued gradient, with a sort of decidedly retro, like, ’70s, ’80s graphic design aesthetic. And when you look back up at Mama, she pulls back the lapel of her duster, and you see that same patch sewn into the inside of her duster. [music fades in] And she says,
Mama: I’m asking you three to join the Pine Guard.
{33:28}
[Commercial Break]
{38:23}
Mama: I’m asking you three to join the Pine Guard. [Justin snorts] ...I know it kinda sounds like a brand of cleaning product.
Aubrey: Pine-Sol!
Mama: Yeah, it’s a different— it’s a different thing. I mean, we’re not too worried about copyright infringement, because, um, you know, this is not something that we’re going to go around talking about. There’s not going to be, like, t-shirts and merch for the Pine Guard.
Griffin: There will definitely, definitely be merch for the t-shirts and the badges of the Pine Guard, [Clint: Oh, okay.] you can find it on our online store.
Aubrey: Is the badge scratch and sniff?
Mama: Um, I mean, it can be if you spray it with some sort of thing or rub it up against [Aubrey: Excellent.] a car air freshener or something. Listen, I know— I know this is heavy, but y’all don’t need to decide right now, but I think—
Aubrey: I’m in!
Mama: Just like that?
Aubrey: Yep!
Ned: Is there health insurance?
Griffin: She says,
Mama: There’s the opposite of health insurance. There’s health endangerment, if anything [someone snorts], but, listen, we’ve reached a point now where it’s— it’s all hands on deck. I’ve been doing this for 30 years, and I’ve never seen anything like that beast in the woods. These—
Aubrey: You’ve been doing this since you were 5?
Mama: What?
Aubrey: ‘Cause— it’s, like, complime— you look so young!
Mama: Oh, my gosh. Okay, Aubrey. Thank you.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: These— these things in the— in the woods, they’re getting stronger for whatever reason. And y’all got ambushed last night, and you held your ground. And so I truly believe with a bit more prep work, you’re gonna tear that thing down.
Griffin: And with that, Barclay enters the room and he’s got a tray with, um, some bowls of radish stew, which he places in front of each of you and then, um, you see him take out that paper that Dani was sketching on out in the lobby, which he places on the center of the table, and you see a detailed drawing of that beast in the woods. And Mama says,
Mama: This office is the ready room for the Pine Guard now. We figure out what the— what the beast is capable— what the Abomination’s capable of, what it’s weak against, what kind of upper hand we can hope to gain on it before we go hunting, and gang, we gotta go tonight. These things, they— they show up every couple months, like, about three nights before the full moon, and then we got one advantage— just one advantage— for the next week, they gotta stay within a mile or so radius around the gate. But we lose that window, we lose that week, and they can go wherever they want, and if that happens, well, word and, you know, death and destruction starts to get around. So the window’s almost closed, so it’s— it’s best we get started right now, so—
Travis: Aubrey looks over at the map.
Aubrey: How big is the mon— Monan— Monangaliah— For—
Mama: Monongahela.
Aubrey: What is it?
Mama: It’s trick— Monongahela. I know, it’s tricky.
Aubrey: Ok. How big is that compared to where the gate is, and where Kepler is? Is that mile— do we need to worry about Kepler?
Mama: I mean, yeah, Kepler’s in the radius. I’ve had to very discreetly dispatch some stuff here in Kepler. Lot of the woods is in it, the mountain, Mount Kepler’s obviously in it, there’s a lot of places that we can go hunting. It’s not a, you know, it’s not a small area.
Duck: If you’re asking how big the forest, that’s 1,433— 39 square miles.
Mama: Yeah, it’s a big-ass forest.
Duck: It’s a big forest.
Mama: It’s a good forest. It’s got Kepler in it, it’s got a bunch of stuff in it. It’s not a small space to hunt them down, and that’s why— that is what we do. We hunt. It’s not like these things are gonna wait for us, we gotta figure out what they want, how we can find ‘em, and once we do find ‘em, what we can do to take ‘em out.
Ned: I need something clarified for me. So you’re telling me that all of these bom-boms [Aubrey: Thank you.] that have been wandering through these woods [Duck: I quit.] for decades have not really been the Goat-boys and the Moth-dudes and the Bigfeets, and the Yahoos, but have been these creatures that came from the other place? [crosstalk] Is that what you’re telling me?
Mama: [crosstalk] Yeah, I mean— Well, I mean, the Sylphs who come from Sylvane, they’re good folks. This is— that’s not who I’m talking about, and I want to make that entirely clear. Fuck, Barclay’s Bigfoot, you ain’t never seen him going around, you know, trashing a, trashing a parking lot—
Aubrey: Barclay’s Bigfoot?!
Griffin: Barclay kind of sighs, and says,
Barclay: Yeah, I’m, uh, I am… Mr. Bigfoot.
Aubrey: Hell yeah, dude! You’re famous as shit!
Barclay: Yeah, it’s regrettable. I’ve been irresponsible, I guess, in the past, but—
Ned: And you’ve traveled a lot! Washington—
Barclay: Yeah, I get around.
Griffin: Um, Mama says,
Mama: That’s— that’s not what we’re facing here. These things, they ain’t Sylphs, whatever they are.
Ned: I wanna know how many of them are— are we talking about here?
Mama: I mean, if we do our job right, there’s only one at a time, it shows up every couple months. Now, I know you—
Ned: I saw nine or ten!
Mama: Yeah, and here’s the thing: I think that’s all part of the same Abomination.
Ned: The same booger.
Mama: What else do we know about this thing?
Griffin: I want to set up that this is, like, the part where we are going to, like, discuss around the table, like, what you know about the monster. This is the part of the— and this is kind of unique to this game, is that, like, a lot of the time, I’m not going to set up the final battle, you all are? Using what you have learned about this monster. So this is the part of the game where you all are going to kind of, like, formulate the battle plan and figure out, like, what this last scene is going to look like, and what you’re gonna do. And this part of the game, I want to be clear, is incredibly vital, because the monsters that I am able to create in this game are so dangerous, and if you are not, like, as tactical and thoughtful about it as is possible, things can go, like, very very bad. So that’s— that’s kind of what we’re doing here.
Justin: Well, before we— before we get into that, Duck, uh, sort of almost— I think mid-sentence, not one of his, somebody else’s, stands up from the table and says,
Duck: Listen. This has been… well, I was going to say “fun,” but that would be inaccurate, obviously. But, uh, I— I can’t do this with y’all. I think it’s real neat what you all are doing, it seems like good work, but, uh, you’re gonna have to count me out of this. Just stay out of the way of the Forest Service and I’ll try to keep things clear for y’all as best I can, but you just— continue on with your exposition there, because I’m— I gotta be getting back to work.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: Well, what is your work, Duck Newton?
Duck: Well, I patrol my sector of the Monongahela National Forest and keep the wildlife and the plantlife safe, and I— I watch over it and I learn and, you know, do some research from time to time to— it’s kind of an even split.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: Protectin’ the wildlife, huh? How many animals do you think this thing’s killed, sucked up into its body? Just a rough estimate, do you reckon? H-how many?
Duck: How many fish do you think the black bear kills on a given day? I mean, that’s nature, right?
Griffin: And she points down to the drawing of the monster on the table. She says,
Mama: This ain’t fuckin’ nature, Duck. This is something from somewhere else that came into our world to destroy it, to destroy the forest and kill everything inside of it. That sounds like it fits your job duties one hundred percent.
Duck: And I am a guy! I’m just Duck! I— I looked at that thing last night, you— you don’t understand, you’ve been dealing with this a long time. I looked at that thing— it wanted to kill me. It could’ve killed me! If I’d given it half a chance! And maybe you all are itchin’ to throw yourselves into the— into the fire from the proverbial frying pan, but I’m not! I want to keep living, hell, I got a boat to finish, I got a cat to feed, I— this isn’t me!
Griffin: She says,
Mama: I think you’re selling yourself short there, Duck. I think— I mean, hell, do you think most folks could have faced off against this thing last night and lived to tell the tale about it?
Duck: I mean, I’m not— I’ll admit that I’m— I mean, I’m tougher than your average— I was gonna say bear, but I mean, that’s technically, I guess, still accurate, but I mean, really think about this for a second. I mean, walk through with me. We could sit here and make all the plans we want, and then we go out into the forest, right, and we find it, and then it sees me and I see it, and then I rear back and— what the fuck finishes that sentence? Seriously! What do I do, do I run up and punch it in its stomach? Am I gonna spin kick it? What— what is my— what exactly is the plan here that your buddy— I sure am— I’m kinda hard to kill, but, you know, I— I’m not exactly, you know, packin’ heavy artillery over here!
Aubrey: Duck? I— I think you’re scared. And I think that’s okay. I mean, this— that thing, that Abomination, was scary, but there’s lots and lots of people in that town, and lots and lots of people everywhere that don’t know about it, and can’t do anything about it. And we can! We can help! We can keep them from being scared! So our little bit of being scared is still way less than all of theirs added together. We— we can help! We can do something! And I don’t know what it is yet, you don’t know what it is yet, and maybe even Mama doesn’t know what it is yet, but we can do it, at least something. Something’s better than nothing, right?
Duck: Lady Flame, I— I appreciate it. I honestly do, those are kind words. And they also came from the mouth of someone that can shoot fire out of their hands. I mean, you— you understand why you might be a little better equipped to take on something like this, yeah?
Ned: Duck?
Duck: Ned.
Ned: I just remembered something. What about your special item in the Chicanerie?
Duck: Aw, god, Ned! Ned, I told you to throw that thing away!
Ned: I don’t throw anything away! I’m a big hairy hoarder! I’ve got it in my— in the Chicanerie, in the inner, inner sanctum at the Cryptonomica!
Duck: God dammit, Ned, one thing, man! Fuck! I ask one thing— I mean, shame on me, I guess, I should’ve seen this coming, seems pretty blindingly obvious in hindsight.
Ned: Well, it’s even worse, I tried to Ebay it about two years ago—
Duck: Okay, good.
Ned: Nothing happened.
Duck: From the start of that word, I thought you were about to say you tried to eat it.
Aubrey: Yeah, I actually did think that too.
Duck: I thought you were going to say that—
Griffin: Mama says,
Mama: Look, I know it seems impossible, Duck, I get that, but let’s just talk it over. We’ll talk over the plan. If we get to the end of the plan, and you still feel like you go out there you’re gonna meet your maker, I don’t blame you for walking away. But let’s— just sit down, and eat your stew, and we’ll just talk it over.
Duck: [softly] ...Fine.
Griffin: And with that, you all start formulating the plan. So, I have, like, a few questions here that I want you all to kind of answer, and it can be sort of in fiction, if you want, as you sort of devise this plan, but they are sort of the things you need to know, and they are things that you already do know, if you can— if you were paying attention and remember sort of the things that have happened so far in order to make this plan happen. So Mama says,
Mama: All right. So this thing’s obviously some kind of animal in nature, whatever it is underneath, it has sort of animal instincts. What kind of— what kind of behaviours y’all pick up on?
Ned: Well, there’s the black snot. [Aubrey: Yep.] That— that seemed to almost be like alive? On its own?
Duck: Yeah, that’s how it seemed to me, and it seemed to be able to absorb other animals into itself? I couldn’t tell if it was just dead or alive animals, but it— it seemed to be able to absorb them, for lack of a better word.
Aubrey: Well, and there was the moment where it was going to attack me, and then, uh, you threw some shit, Ned, and that—
Ned: [amused] I do throw a lot of shit.
Aubrey: You threw some shit, and that distracted it.
Mama: Animal shit? Human shit? What was it?
Aubrey: I didn’t stop to look.
Ned: Kind of a— kind of a goulash—
Mama: Oh god, stop, stop. You’re eating stew as you’re saying this, you ghoul.
Griffin: She takes out a little felt tip marker and starts writing on the drawing some of these notes— that it’s like patched together with this living black slime, and that uh, it was attracted to animals, that it seems to want to hunt animals, and so this powerful sort of stew of animal scents attracted it. Writes all that down. Barclay chimes in and says,
Barclay: And don’t forget that it seems to be able to have other animals out there looking around for it, other animals that are sort of possessed by that slime, so we should keep an eye out for that, also.
Griffin: And he takes a note on that. And she says,
Mama: All right. So, we don’t want to get caught surprised when we’re fighting this thing, so what— what’s its abilities, what’s it capable of while we’re—
Aubrey: Big.
Mama: Big.
Griffin: [amused] She writes down “big” [crosstalk] in big letters.
Duck: [crosstalk] Yeah, write down big. Angry, put down that.
Aubrey: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Duck: Yeah, it was— it seemed real, uh, hmm— impulsive. You know, a lot of animals are pretty easily spooked if you make enough noise or enough light, but I— I, you know, tried to provoke it and it made a run at me right away, which is pretty unusual for the wildlife you find around here.
Aubrey: Well, and that happened too ‘cause when the vehicle— when the thing drove up, it ran.
Griffin: She writes all that down. “Impulsive, acts on instinct, prone to run away.” She says,
Mama: Sounds like we’re gonna have to keep this thing contained if we wanna have a chance at taking it down for good, just so it doesn’t run off again and we lose our window.
Ned: And you two did hurt it— the walking stick, the fiery walking stick, did hurt it. And the fire seemed to hurt it. Not a lot—
Aubrey: I mean, to be fair, fire hurts most things.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: Now hold on, hold on. This is important, because in my experience every one of these things has something that it is susceptible to. Are you telling me that fire seemed to do some damage to this thing?
Aubrey: Yeah?
Griffin: She looks over at you, Aubrey, and says,
Mama: Well ain’t that a coinky-dink.
Griffin: And writes down in huge letters, “weakness: fire.”
Aubrey: Now, okay, but to be fair, I want to point to the biggest— to “big,” remember? Big? I can make fi— some fire, but, like, we’re going to need— we hit it with the oil lantern, and that helped. I think we’re going to need more oil, or something.
Griffin: She is grinning ear to ear as you say that. She says,
Mama: All right then. Got everything we know about this monster. What’s the plan?
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t have an idea for like where this fight’s gonna take place, or how it’s going to play out— this is now your guys’ turn to give me an idea. Where do you want this thing to take place and what are you going to do to make it your, sort of, most ideal situation?
Travis: Okay, so just to cover our bases, right? Here’s what we’ve just discussed: we need somewhere where we can corner it, or at the very least, like, contain it a little bit for the fight. Um, we’re going to need to draw it there, we’re going to need to then set up some kind of oil propellant and flame trap.
Griffin: By the way, Travis and I talked about this before we started recording, we’ve all been playing a lot of Monster Hunter lately, and it’s so choice the way that this is kind of in-line with that, I fuckin love this game so very very much. Um, but yeah, that’s— I mean, that sounds solid to me. I want to make it clear that I don’t have, like, a map of Kepler, where you guys are going to pick a location, there’s a whole concept in all the Apocalypse world games of— of leave empty spaces on maps for you guys to fill in, so you can will places into existence— not that I’m saying, like, “Oh, the old fiery tar pit [crosstalk] that is covered in spikes—”
Travis: [crosstalk] Wait, can we have that? That would be great.
Griffin: No, but like, something within reason, where you can, you know, set this thing up to fight it is what I’m— what i’m hoping for.
Aubrey: Duck? Is there any kind of, like, ca— maybe not cave, but like, ravine, or…
Duck: Here’s something else, man, I’m not going to have a big goddamn fire in the middle of my forest. So we’re gonna need to be pretty smart about where exactly the— this takes place. Now, now caves… That’s an interesting idea. The— the caves are actually… huh. They’re closed right now, but closed to the public, ‘cause of White Nose Syndrome, it killed a bunch of bats in the winter 2006, so we closed down the cave systems. So they wouldn't be actually open to the public, so maybe the— maybe the caves? ‘Least there the fire would be contained.
Griffin: Mama goes over to the couch with all the maps on it and grabs one of the Monongahela Forest and spreads it out, and she says,
Mama: Duck, you know this forest better than anyone else on earth. Can you, uh, can you pick a place?
Duck: Yeah, I got the spot.
Griffin: And she hands you the marker.
Duck: Right here. Crooked Bend.
Mama: Crooked Bend Cave?
Duck: Crooked Bend Cave. We all make fun of the name, ‘cause honestly, Crooked Bend is like— yeah, what other kind of bend is there? But who knows.
Ned: Oh, I always thought it was Crooked Ben!
Duck: No, no, no. A lot of people think it was Crooked Ben.
Ned: I thought that was old Ben Whoopsie!
Duck: Well they made the sign they painted over it, and we just haven’t had the budget [Ned: Aahh.] to fix it up yet, honestly. But yeah, Crooked Bend Cave.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: All right, we’re gonna attract this thing to the cave using… what? And then what are we gonna do once we get it in there?
Ned: Oh, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this… What about [sighs] the Wookiee costume? Doused in all of the animal shit. I’ll pop the top on the Lincoln and drive around until I get the big booger’s attention, and lure him to the cave.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: Yeah, that’s— that seems a bit dangerous for you, Ned, but if you think it’ll work, I think it’s worth a shot.
Ned: Well, Danger is my middle name. Oh, I’m sorry— Fuckin’ is my middle name [others laugh]. Danger’s the other middle name.
Mama: All right, we get this— we get this thing to the cave, and then what?
Aubrey: Do you have a generator?
Mama: Uh, yeah, sure. I mean, I would prefer not to destroy my generator—
Aubrey: Is it diesel?
Mama: Um, I mean, yeah, we got lots of gas around here.
Aubrey: Ok. So, we get that to the cave, we get the thing to the cave, and we get me to the cave, and I think we’re pretty much gonna be set.
Duck: Yeah, we’re also gonna need to finish it, though, I mean that’ll start things off, but it— it won’t be enough to put an end to it.
Griffin: She says,
Mama: Yeah, let’s, um, let’s talk weapons. What can y’all get your hands on before nightfall? I got plenty of stuff, I’ve been doing this a long time, I’ve got sort of my own routine I like to follow. I think it’d probably be best if me and Barclay handle the reinforcements that are probably goin’ to show up once this thing starts howling. We’ll leave the, uh— the beast to you guys.
Aubrey: I have a knife.
Mama: I think, uh, I think you’re probably goin’ to be set, your hands are kind of your weapons there, Aubrey, what with the mystical flames and all.
Aubrey: Oh, yeah.
Mama: Duck, Ned, what about you two? You mentioned something about something you had back at the Cryptonomica?
Ned: Yeah, we did, didn’t we, Duck?
Mama: Ned, what about you? What are you packing, bud?
Ned: I, actually have something of my own back at the Cryptonomica, a trophy from my past, it’s called a .357 Magnum, the most powerful handgun made and can take your head clean off.
Mama: Well, it might be able to take my head clean off— I hope it wouldn’t, please be careful with that thing while you’re out there, but, uh, did— do you think that’ll actually be able to take a piece out of this thing?
Ned: Yeah, it might get its attention. [chuckling]
Griffin: She says,
Mama: All right, sounds like— sounds like we got a plan.
Griffin: She looks at the newspaper on her desk. She says,
Mama: All right. Sunset’s at 5:50 tonight. We’ll meet at Crooked Bend at 6. Ned, bring your car; and everybody else, bring your— your weapons.
Griffin: And Mama stands up from the table and she says,
Mama: I feel like— look, it’s just been me and Barclay doing this for a while, so I’m a little out of practice with my motivational speeches. Just— just watch each other’s backs, and play it smart, and I guarantee you we’re gonna take the night. [Amnesty theme begins to play] I don’t know why these things show up in our woods, but I think they’re here to scare us. We’re gonna show ‘em that the fine folks o’ Kepler, West Virginia ain’t so easily shook.
Justin: Duck stands up and he starts walking out of the room.
Aubrey: Duck? Where you goin’?
Duck: [sighs] I’m going to take back what’s mine.

Griffin: Previously, on The Adventure Zone…
Aubrey: It’s just kinda the one thing my mom took with her when- when she fell out with the family, the Flamebright Pendant.
Mama: It’s called the Flamebright Pendant, and you didn’t think that that was germane?
Minerva: Where is your chosen weapon, Duck Newton?
Duck: Y’know what, honestly, it kinda creeped me out, so I, uh, I had a friend hold onto it.
Ned: I got into a little bit of trouble in my- my not-so-shiny past. [chuckles nervously]
Mama: We can’t let the folks of this fine town live in fear of some… big monsters lookin’ to do ‘em harm.
Travis: We are going to need to then set up some kind of oil and flame trap.
Ned: I’ll pop the top on the Lincoln and drive around until I lure him to the cave!
Mama: Just watch each other’s backs, play it smart, and I guarantee you we’re gonna take the night!
Aubrey: Duck, where you- where you goin’?
Duck: I’m goin’ to take back what’s mine.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
{1:42}
Griffin: All right, we’re gonna— we’re gonna do this damn thing. We should mention that Dad, for the first time ever, is recording at his own setup at home, so if he comes in sounding like some sort of shrieking demon [Clint laughs] or horrible gargoyle…
Travis: Yeah, I do like that after four years we were like “Y’know, we’re gonna wait for the finale episode of this arc to have Dad do it on his own.”
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: I was listening to an episode of— the first live episode of Hello From the Magic Tavern, and at the beginning of it, they had a witch come on and curse them with technical difficulties—
[Griffin and Clint laugh]
Justin: And I thought “Fuck that’s good, I wish I could steal that!”
Griffin: Wish we could. If Dad is—
Justin: An in-fiction antagonist of audio difficulties? It’s amazing!
Griffin: If Dad sounds bone-out, it’s because there’s… interference coming from the— the gate in the middle of the woods.
Clint: Oh, good, good, good.
Griffin: There we go, that’s set up, and let’s— we’ve put this off long enough, let’s get busy.
[ambient forest sounds fade in]
Griffin: Ned, you are sitting in the driver’s seat of the Continental in the middle of the Monongahela National Forest in a small clearing, just a couple hundred yards away from the arch where you encountered the beast the previous evening. You’re parked just off the access road, a quarter mile up from which is Crooked Bend Cave, where your accomplices lie in wait. And you’ve been here for nearly an hour, just sorta camped out, keys in the ignition, but the car and the headlights turned off. You’re sitting in your musked-up Wookiee costume, which I can’t imagine is terribly comfortable. How’ve you been sort of spending your time, just sort of hanging out here in your car in the woods in the middle of the night?
Clint: Wishing I wasn’t there, was one. And saying:
Ned: I wish I wasn’t fuckin’ doin’ this, I wish I wasn’t fuckin’ doin’ this, I wish I wasn’t fuckin’ doin’ this…
Clint: And listening to Broadway showtunes.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I’m listenin’ to Come from Away right now.
Griffin: Alright, I like that. I think you’re in the middle of saying, “I wish I wasn’t fuckin’ doin’ this, I wish I wasn’t fuckin’ doin’ this,” when, all of a sudden, just like last night, the ambient sounds of the forest grow quieter and quieter still, the hum of crickets and frogs and owls fades out, as if switched by a dimmer, until there’s no sound at all. And then, immediately in front of you, you hear the sound of multiple mouths’ pained breathing, and see the moonlight glint off of a shape ten yards in front of you. What do you do?
Clint: I say, one last time:
Ned: I wish I wasn’t fuckin’ doin’ this.
Clint: And then rear up in the seat, so that his head’s pokin’ up out of the top, hits the lights, lays on the horn, and says:
Ned: Here I am, ya big goof! Come out and get my ass!
Griffin: I think the headlights flash on as the engine starts with a roar, and a dozen pupils narrow as the beast is illuminated right in front of you. And, for a moment, it just… stares at you. And it sniffs the air, catching your scent, and for a few beats, it just stops and stands there, surveying the car, almost like it’s trying to make up its mind. And then, it takes a step forward. And then another, deliberately. Slowly at first, and then a third, faster, before it breaks out into a full-on charge in your direction with an echoing scream. What do you do?
Clint: Well, I pull a sick drivin’ move. [Travis chuckles] I throw it into reverse, and then I slam my foot down on the accelerator…
Griffin: Yeah, a Tokyo Drift.
Clint: I Tokyo Drift, so I have— the trunk is facing them, and… I lay on the horn and gun the shit outta that car.
Griffin: It comes pretty close to your car as you turn around and gun it, and just as you gun it, I think a claw narrowly misses the trunk. The car sort of lurches as you hit the access road and get on and start driving towards the cave.
Clint: And I’m singin’ at the top of my lungs.
Ned: [singing loudly] Born free, as free as the wind blows!
Griffin: Are you— as you’re driving, are you keeping an eye on the beast somehow?
Clint: Well, the rear-view mirror.
Griffin: Okay. I think you are driving, now, and singing into the wind, and occasionally just peeking up into the rear-view mirror, and you see the beast behind you, and then you look back at the road, and then you look back at the rear-view mirror, and… you don’t see the beast tailing you, anymore. One minute it was there, and the next it was just gone. And… you kind of turn back to look behind you to see where it is and you don’t see it. And it’s as you’re turning back towards the front of the car to look at where you’re driving, you do a double-take, and you look with horror out your passenger-side window. And just behind the pine trees lining the road, you see the beast barrelling at speed with your car, and it’s frenzied; black slime is just spewing from its mouth, streaming behind it as it runs, and its eyes, its many eyes are pulsating with bright red light. And before you have a chance to do anything else, it takes one last long step, and jumps in the direction of your car.
Ned: [singing to the tune of Born Free] Oh shit!
Clint: I believe the smart thing to do would be to veer to the right? [chuckles]
Griffin: You jerk the wheel to the right just as you see this frenzied beast leaping in your direction, and… it just narrowly misses you, and sort of tumbles behind you and rolls and then gets right back to that full gallop, now a bit further behind you. And as you veer to the right, you’re on this narrow access road, and your wheels skip off the side of the road a little bit, and your headlights illuminate a pine tree right in front of you, and your car is flying with deadly speed toward it, and it’s getting closer and closer—
Ned, you’re lying on the ground several years earlier. And—
Travis: How hard did he hit that tree?!
Griffin: [chuckles] And as you come to, you see a black Imperial Crown Coupe wrapped around a tree. Its engine is sputtering pathetically as smoke is pouring out from behind its crumpled hood, and in this moment, in the past— you forget where you are, it’s night— you remember that you just completed the biggest job of your career, and the trunk of the Imperial is loaded with your haul, though you assume some of it was probably damaged in the crash. And in the driver’s seat of this Imperial Crown Coupe, is your accomplice, who you can see is breathing, but lying unconscious, splayed out on the air bag that now lies deflated on the dashboard. And you’re on a country road somewhere, not too dissimilar from the one you’re driving on in present day, and further down this crooked country road, you hear police sirens speeding in your direction. What did you do?
Clint: [sighs] I’m… I’m gonna try to wake up the accomplice.
Griffin: Okay. The door on the driver’s side is kind of crumpled in and you can’t seem to— you couldn’t seem to get it open, the latch mechanism is just completely busted.
Ned: Well, sorry, old friend.
Clint: I’m gonna run back to the trunk and just stuff my pockets with as much of the stuff as I can, there’s… jewelry, there’s… bric a brac, there’s some Hummel figurines, which is kind of a sweet touch—
Travis: The Hummel figurines are probably broken.
Clint: No, no! I know how to pack stolen goods!
Griffin: They’re surprisingly sturdy, okay.
Clint: And I fill my pockets and then… I gotta run into the woods!
Griffin: All right. That’s what we see, we see… Ned go to the window and try to get the door open, is unable to do so, and apologizes to his accomplice before running to the back of the car, grabbin’ everything he can as these sirens are getting closer and closer and closer, and then he dashes off into the woods with one last look over his shoulder before disappearing into the night. Act Under Pressure.
Clint: ‘Kay. … 10!
Griffin: Great!
Clint: And I think I add one for Cool, don’t I?
Griffin: Uh, yeah, when you’re driving, also, you get plus one, so that’s a 12, I guess.
Travis: Super cool!
Griffin: You see that tree flying toward you, and you jerk the wheel to the left and get back on the road and avoid it by inches. And, with the beast in hot pursuit, you tear down the road in your busted-up Continental— I think after your first crash into the arch a couple episodes ago, you’ve probably just got the one headlight functioning? And—
Clint: And the other one’s just, like, danglin’ by a couple of wires! [laughs]
Griffin: Yeah! And as you are driving, speeding down this access road, your one headlight catches Mama and Barclay hiding out in a bush in the distance, right next to a sign hanging over a craggy hole in the rockface by the river, a sign for Crooked Bend Cave.
Aubrey.
Travis: Yes?
Griffin: Aubrey, you’re in Crooked Bend Cave, where the trap is set, the oil is spread along the floor in the cave’s entrance chamber. It’s a huge space that’s, right now, lit by floodlights that Duck borrowed from the ranger station, and these floodlights are shining along the smooth tan walls of this cave, bouncing off several stalactites hanging from the ceiling of this area. What have you been doing, as you’ve kinda just been waiting in this space for the better part of an hour?
Travis: Well, I want to, you know… I don’t know if everybody did this when they were a little kid playing hide and seek, but like, when you bounce kinda from hiding spot to hiding spot because you keep thinking of a better one?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Like that’s what Aubrey’s been doing, waiting like, “Oh no, wait,” and like moving to go behind a different—
Griffin: Where did you land, where are you hiding right now, in this moment?
Travis: I think, right now, she might be between spots? Y’know, like, she hasn’t stopped switching spots and I think it’s a result of nerves… but I don’t think she knows that, but she’s headed towards— she sees a rock that’s kind of like— it’s two rocks side-by-side— where there would be a good view between them [Griffin: Okay.] of the entrance, she’s headed for that.
Griffin: I like this, okay, so you’re sort of scampering from one spot to another as you’ve been waiting here for such a long time, and while you’re doing so, the stillness of this cave is broken as you hear footsteps racing down the slope, into this main chamber, and a few seconds later, you see Ned, still in the Wookiee costume, singing at the top of his lungs, running into this cave.
Aubrey: Hi, Ned!
Ned: Uh, hello Aubrey! How’s your evening?
[Griffin chuckles]
Aubrey: Going well!
Griffin: Ned, I imagine you take your position, as you enter the cave. And just a few moments later, the beast makes its entrance, it slides down the slope into the cave and skids to a halt in the center of this chamber, and I think it kind of hits the oil patch and sends up a big splash that kinda covers its fur a little bit, and it also kind of drifts a little as it hits the ground? And because you were sort of out in the open as you were changing positions, you’re both just fully exposed to each other, and now you can tell how different the beast looks from what you saw last night, it looks furious, its eyes are glowing red, the animals absorbed across its pelt are all twisting and sort of beating against its body as it looks in your direction and howls. What do you do?
Travis: I think Aubrey says:
Aubrey: Sorry about this.
Travis: And... shoots some flame.
Griffin: We see Aubrey— you raise your hand and a spark ignites on your glove, which manifests into a small flame, which you clench in your fist and you take a deep breath, and you close your eyes…
And now we see you in that chamber, earlier this afternoon. You’re holding a flashlight, and you’re surveying this big chamber, and Barclay steps into your flashlight’s beam and he puts his hand to the ground as he kneels down, and he says:
Barclay: Yeah, I think this is the place. So… what did you— what did you have in mind?
Aubrey: Well, I was thinking, like, oil? On the ground. And then… fire. Um…
Barclay: I don’t wanna fill this cave up with oil and then have you all get in it, and then you set it on fire and you die. I wanna try to, like, control it—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] No, that’s fair.
Barclay: Some strategic oil- oil placement. So, any guidance you can give me for some, like, specific oil placement would be ideal.
Aubrey: Okay, here’s what I want. Give me a big patch right in the middle, and then a second ring around it. So, kind of a target shape, so that way if we get him in the middle, we can then keep him from fleeing with a second barrier? Does that make sense?
Barclay: Yeah, I’ll make that second ring a, uh, [chuckles] a burning ring of fire?
Aubrey: [gets the pun] Eh?
Barclay: I’ll make it nice and big so you guys have some space to work. That’s a good plan, I think we’re gonna get him in that.
Aubrey: Thank you.
Griffin: And then I think the two of you— I think he hands you a couple of canisters of oil that they use for the lanterns back in the lodge, and the two of you take a few minutes to set up this trap: a big patch right in the middle, and a big ring that it is sort of— you have, like, one stream of oil connected to, so you can light the whole thing up in one go. And it’s quick work; you just spread this oil out on the ground, you take a few minutes to, like, survey the scene, find some good places to hide… and Barclay, after finishing up helpin’ you out, put this oil down, he says:
Barclay: Aubrey, I gotta ask, why are you doin’ this? Like, don’t get me wrong, I’m extremely grateful for the help, I’ve been tryin’ to get Mama to expand the Pine Guard’s ranks for… months? I guess she’s been... burned before, and she hasn’t had the folks that she felt like she could trust enough with her secret, but you, like… what’re you doin’ here?
Aubrey: Well, y’know, I… honestly, I don’t know! It’s one of those things… I’m sure you, as a Bigfoot, can relate to this, but it’s just a feeling of— I feel like I’m supposed- like I belong? Like I’m supposed to do it?
Griffin: He smiles, and he’s like:
Barclay: Yeah, I know that feeling. I had a lot of dark days before I knew that feeling, it makes me… it fills me with joy that you, uh… you feel that way, Aubrey.
Aubrey: Well, I’m not one for impulse control? And… so, if my gut is like “Yeah!”, then I’m like “Yeah!” and I’m— why question it if I feel like I’m supposed to be doing it and I can help… yeah!
Barclay: Agreein’ to do this thing’s one thing, tonight, you’re gonna be— you’re gonna be facin’ down death. And… I’ve been at this a little while, and so, like, my only advice— well, it’s— ah, Jesus, it’s tough, Aubrey, ‘cause if you were anyone else, I’d advise you to just lean into the fear you’re gonna feel when you look in that thing’s eyes when it’s on you, ‘cause fear’s good for most folks, Aubrey, it keeps ‘em ready. But you… I’ve known you a day, Aubrey, and I can tell you’re powerful in a way that I’ve never really seen before, and that power…
Griffin: And he stands up from his kneeling position and he faces you, and he says:
Barclay: We got a sayin’, back in Sylvane… “Wild winds don’t turn the mill.” That power you’ve got— if you don’t keep it under control, it can be turned against you in an instant, it can be turned against the people you love in an instant. Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I’m sayin’?
Aubrey: Yeah, but frankly, Barclay, the same could be said about a sword, or a gun, or a car, or anything.
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: Or a Bigfoot. I— look… I don’t mean to tell your business, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to preach, I know that you can handle yourself, it’s just, I am— I’m speakin’ from experience, Aubrey. It takes one misstep, it takes one moment, and you can find yourself usin’ that power in a way that you will regret for the rest of your life.
Griffin: Roll plus Weird for Use Magic.
Travis: [rolls dice] It is, well, it’s an eight, frankly.
Griffin: Okay. That’s good. Pick a glitch for me!
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: From the list of Use Magic glitches. And this is a very fun thing about Spellslinger, and I— when you’re picking these, I would, again, lit- get down on my knees and beg you not to pick the thing that is gonna be most, like, help you win the game, but instead the thing that is gonna be the most [Clint laughs] narratively interesting?
Travis: No, I think I’m gonna have to go with “The magic draws immediate unwelcome attention.”
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Yeah, ‘cause I think the plan had been “from a hiding place, ignite the fire and then Ned and Aubrey would skirt the ring and get outside the cave.”
Griffin: Yeah, but because of this unwanted attention, that escape plan is no longer on the table. I— yeah, that is taken off the table. We see the fire erupt from your open palm in slow motion and spread across the surface of the oil patch, and we see the beast’s heads turn in unison towards the heat and the light as the oil below it and covering its fur ignites, setting the beast ablaze for six Harm. And the ground [Justin: Whoooa.] shakes as its screams reverberate through the cavern, and you see its eyes actually tear open further, revealing some more of that red light, and you also see holes burning in its patchwork pelt, and it’s revealing this black slime carapace within. But the beast, it, like, instinctively from that spot in the middle of the floor, turns towards you, Aubrey, and takes a swing, and I think you have to roll, and as you do, you land inside of the ring of fire, and now all three of you are trapped in this fight, sort of engaging with this beast.
And, Duck.
Justin: Hey! [announcer voice] Welcome to the podcast, Justin Tyler McElroy.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: [announcer voice] Special guest!
Griffin: Duck, from your position in the cave, which— where is that?
Justin: From what I heard, I was in the ring of fire, correct?
Griffin: Yeah, you are all in the ring of fire now.
Justin: Well, then, it seems like that’s my locale!
[Travis chuckles]
Griffin: Well, it’s a big ring of fire, I’m imagining— were you hiding out, waiting for the trap to be sprung? What were you doin’?
Justin: Uh, yeah, I think that would make the most sense.
Griffin: Okay. I think the ring of fire is, like, the whole circumference of this chamber.
Justin: Okay, yeah.
Griffin: It’s more to contain him than—
Justin: I would say towards the back, then. Like, towards the back, away from the entrance.
Griffin: Are you hidin’ behind somethin’?
Justin: Uh… nope!
Griffin: You— I guess you’re just sort of back towards the entrance and you saw the beast, like, run in past you, didn’t really pay you any mind, and then you saw Aubrey set the fuckin’ room on fire. And you see this explosion just tear through the beast, and you watch as it rears up and see its patchwork pelt tearing and burning in the flames. What do you do?
Justin: I rush it, with my weapon.
Griffin: We see you reach over your shoulder and you grab the hilt of your weapon, this instrument of destiny that you still don’t quite understand, and I think we see you from behind, actually, just your silhouette, as you rush towards this beast in the pyre, and you race towards it, ready to strike toward the flames…
And then we see you just a few hours ago, as the bell above the door of the Cryptonomica chimes, as Ned and Duck walk into the museum, while you go and take back what’s yours. And at this point, you and Dad go for it and describe how this hand-off happens!
Duck: [exasperated] Well… where is it?
Ned: In the Chicanerie! I keep only the most secret things back there, so… [Duck: Yeah.] nosy Kirby doesn’t get it. C’mon!
Justin: I follow him to the back.
Clint: And we go back, and come finally to a door— a quadruple-locked door. Ned puts his click-reader glasses on and goes through a set of keys, and unlocks it and leads Duck back into the Chicanerie.
Griffin: So you take him back into the inner sanctum, as it were.
Clint: The inner [crosstalk] inner sanctum.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Inner sanctum, yeah, this is the room you talked about earlier that Kirby’s not really allowed into. Is Duck, like, the first person who’s ever been in here that isn’t you?
Clint: Yes. Oh, nobody’s allowed back in the Chicanerie.
Griffin: All right.
Clint: It is the inner-est sanctum. [in Ned’s voice] And there are— now a character voice I can’t get out of— there are display cases, all kinds of display cases and shelves—
Travis: And empty Coke Zero cans everywhere.
Clint: Oh no, the new Diet Coke, Feisty Cherry! Mm.
Travis: [sarcastic] Still lookin’ for sponsors, by the way, if you’re listening, Diet Coke.
Griffin: [sarcastic] Yeah, Diet Coke’s a big one for podcasts, if you can lock down Diet Coke for your podcast, you’re set for life.
Clint: Listen, I love this new Feisty Cherry because not only does it have that cherry flavor but it also has that little bit of kick of heat in it.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: But all these locked display cases— one of ‘em has an Oscar in it…
[Griffin laughs]
Clint: And, uh…
Griffin: [laughing] Ned stole a fucking Oscar!
Clint: When you look at it—
Griffin: No, we gotta dial in on this, who did you steal an Oscar from and what’s the Oscar?
Clint: It’s, uh, Clooney’s Oscar for Sicario. [Griffin: That’s mean!] He won an Oscar for Sicario—
Griffin: I know, he went through so much to make that movie! Why would you steal his fucking Oscar for it?
Clint: No, no, no, well, there’s a story behind it, but just to say that he thought it’d be kinda cool to steal somethin’ from Danny Ocean!
Griffin: Yeah, sure, okay.
Clint: And there’s other things, there’s… a briefcase with Mal Evans’ name on it, but we finally end up at a case in the back—
Justin: Syriana? Did you mean Syriana?
Clint: Yeah, what’d I say?
Justin: I wanna keep you from gettin’ a bunch of tweets, Syriana.
Griffin: You said Sicario, it’s a different flick.
Justin: Sicario.
Clint: Oh, different movie, yeah, Syriana. No tweets, please.
Griffin: Yeah, I think you walk by all these cases… there’s a box that you actually got out earlier in the day, in which you keep some of your most prized possessions, it’s where you keep your Magnum? And the ammo for it, you came back here and got strapped, as it were, when you left your meeting with Mama in the lodge, and there’s a few other things in there, too, there’s probably a couple passports and driver’s licenses with different names but Ned’s picture on it? Some watches, a set of pearl earrings, a few rings, and beneath it all, I think we, the audience, just, like, catch a glint of it for, like, a second as the two of you walk by, there’s a pendant on a silver chain, set with a large, bright red stone. And you walk past that as you arrive at the case with the weapon of destiny in it.
Clint: So, it’s the only item in the case… it’s dark. Each one of the cases has its own light switch, so that a little spotlight kinda, y’know, highlight it, y’know, like you do. And I flip the switch on and it illuminates… the weapon!
Duck: [groans] I really— I’m havin’ kinda second thoughts.
Ned: About?
Duck: At this point… oh, god, man, once… once I open that case, I mean, this is real, this is happening. And it’s… it’s so annoying.
Ned: An— annoying? What do you mean, annoying?
Duck: The sword, man. It’s so annoying.
Ned: Does it talk in a funny voice, I mean…?
Duck: Just open the fucking case, before I change my mind.
Ned: Alright. [clears throat] Back on with the clicks, key, open it up… there it is!
Griffin: I want this moment of the case open and, Duck, you are standing in front of it, and on this cushion, you… see the weapon, and are just kinda confronted with your past, all of the moments that your destiny has called out to you and you have turned away from it, and, for the first time, you’re actually considering doing the opposite.
Justin: What I see in front of me is a coil. It’s a coil of a… it looks like a sword that’s been coiled, basically. There’s a hilt… not terribly wide, but there’s a hilt there. And then the sword is kind of rolled, almost like a whip, I guess.
Griffin: And we should mention, this is, like, a Chosen thing. You built this weapon using a series of tags, can you tell me what those are, just so I know for the fight?
Justin: The Form is Handle.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: Artifact, Blade, and Chain.
Griffin: Chain being, like, it’s…
Justin: Well, y’know what? It— actually, for what it is, it would probably be…
Griffin: It’d probably be Long.
Justin: Long would probably be… yeah.
Griffin: I like the idea of a chain sword, but that’s, I think [Justin: That’s another thing.] this is much better, yeah. Long, yeah. And that’s cool- all of those inform the things that, like, narratively, this weapon can do. Okay.
Justin: And I reach in… really slow. [chuckles] And I take the handle. That’s what it’s called? There’s another word for—
Griffin: Hilt.
Justin: Hilt? Yeah, there’s a crossguard, that’s what I meant to say. Crossguard. So I grab the hilt, and when I do, it starts to unfurl. And I hold it up, it unfurls into a blade. And Ned and I hear:
Sword: [voiced by Justin] Well… look what the cat dragged in.
[Clint chuckles]
Duck: Hey, Beacon. Ah, Christ.
Beacon: [bitterly] Well, Duck Newton, I never thought this day would come. Have you had a fun 20 years, Duck? I could sum up my—
[Griffin quietly chokes with laughter]
Duck: I know, man. I know that you’ve been lo—
Beacon: I could sum up my time, if you like. Let me summarize: a man comes into the room. He lays some trash on the ground. He leaves. That happened a thousand times, Duck.
Duck: Yeah, I know. I know it’s been—
Beacon: Who’s your friend, Duck?
Griffin: Can Ned hear this voice?
Justin: Yup! ‘Cause there’s a mouth.
Griffin: [laughing] Oh, god!
Ned: I am totally blown away. You’re a ventriloquist, Duck! I did not know that!
Beacon: This is no parlor trick, beast.
[Griffin chuckles]
Beacon: Imagine my surprise, I almost didn’t recognize you without a can of soda and a magazine. My name is Beacon. I am the light that stands at the edge of the darkness, I am the tower above the fog, I am the most beautiful, terrible weapon ever crafted, and I have spent the last 20 years in a flea market! And hhhow are you?
Ned: You’re also a bit of a prick.
Beacon: Well, I’m a sword! Get it?
[Ned laughs]
[Travis laughs]
Beacon: Do you see, for 20 years, I have wasted my rapier wit.
Griffin: [trying not to laugh, distant from the mic] Jesus Christ!
Beacon: That’s two in one!
Ned: That’s a very cutting comment, my friend.
Beacon: Well, look at you attempting a turn of phrase, that must’ve been exhausting.
[Clint chuckles]
Duck: Do you see what I mean, now? I mean, can you— I got about five minutes of that, and I mean, I was already really, really not sure about this, and he started chatterin’ away, and I was like “Okay. This is not for me.” He was kinda the frosting on the cake, not the whole reason I bailed, obviously.
Griffin: How does it feel, Duck, to hold this weapon— obviously, there’s a slight annoyance that comes alongside it— but the sword is not lying. This is a powerful thing, and you know it is a powerful thing, and you probably haven’t touched it in two decades. How does it feel to be holding it again?
Justin: It’s heavier than I remember, but it— there’s something about it that feels… right. It’s like— y’know what it’s like? It’s like when you leave your backpack somewhere, and even though you’re not carrying the weight of it as you leave, you realize that something is missing? And even though it’s a weight, it is something you have lost, have misplaced, and getting it back, even though it’s a weight, feels… right. And I think that that is the closest approximation to what Duck is feeling at the moment.
Griffin: So we’re back in the present, and we see Duck charging and he has his hand on the hilt, and as he withdraws the blade and it extends to its full length, he strikes towards the beast. Roll to Kick Some Ass!
Justin: Hell yeah. Aw, choice! That is a… 12!
Griffin: Holy shit!
Justin: Yeah, I rolled an 11, I got a plus one on it, that’s a 12!
Griffin: Duck’s rolls are on point. Okay, pick an extra effect.
Justin: I’m going to— and the monster’s currently— is where?
Griffin: It’s in the fire patch, but because of the length of your weapon, I think you’re able to stab and slash at it without gettin’ in the fire.
Justin: It’s in the middle, though, right? It’s where we want it. Okay, I’m going to Inflict Terrible Harm!
Griffin: So that’s 1 extra?
Justin: So three Harm altogether.
Griffin: Okay!
Justin: I think I rush it and bury it into the monster’s— as close as I can get to, like, center mass?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: And I bury it into its gut and I hear:
Beacon: Oh, yes, this is much more like it, see? I love being put to work, Duck, we could’ve been doing this for 20—
Travis: Gross.
Justin: And then he jerks it out so he doesn’t have to hear the sword anymore.
Griffin: I think as you sort of rip the blade out of the beast, you kind of, like, whip it backwards. I imagine you’re still a little unsure of this, you’re not a swordfighter, right, but instinct kinda [Justin: Right.] took over. And as you rip the blade out, kind of up and back over your shoulder, you cut a huge gash through the top of this beast as you do so, and a torrent of this black slime sprays through the air, and finally, as you sort of slice through it, its patchwork pelt just falls away. It is cast off into the fire below, and in this moment, you see the beast’s true form emerging from its chrysalis.
It’s now [Justin: Fuck.] standing six feet tall, six feet wide; it had a bit of padding from the beasts it had absorbed into it. It’s a figure roughly lizard-like in shape, comprised entirely of that black slime material. A tail unfurls at the back of it, it extends about three more feet and that tail ends in a razor-sharp point, just dripping with that slime. And its face is, like, decomposed, with these thin strands of slime connecting its top and bottom jaws, and its hollow eye sockets are filled with that furious red light. And this creature, now exposed, emits a shrill howl, and as that howl subsides, you can hear more sounds, now, coming from the mouth of the cave past the fire: you hear a shotgun discharge twice, you hear a tree crack in half, you hear a mountain lion snarling in defeat, and you can tell that reinforcements are here, and that Mama and Barclay are keeping them out, just as they promised.
And with a mighty leap, this beast hurls itself out of the flames in the center of the room, and it scrambles to its feet right in front of you, Ned. Ned, what do you do?
Clint: Ssshit my pants!
Griffin: [sarcastic] Alright, so that’s Ned’s action.
Clint: I think Ned’s gonna use the Magnum, I don’t— he’s not much of a runner! No, I’m gonna pull the Magnum out of its shoulder-holster— I got one of those cool under-arm holsters— and… shoot the fucker in its head!
Griffin: [chuckles] Okay. Is Ned a confident user of this firearm? I imagine this is kind of a relic of his past, not that you were going around breaking into George Clooney’s house and then shooting a bunch of people on the way out.
Clint: No, I don’t think he’s very competent with it at all, because he wasn’t a strongarm guy, [Griffin: Yeah.] he was just— he was a burglar, he was a sneak thief, he would steal but he would not rob. So no, he’s not, but with a .357 Magnum, especially that close, you don’t really have to be a marksman.
Griffin: True, and I think you are close, so I think this would be a Kick Some Ass and not just free damage, ‘cause this thing is gonna be able to get at you, too. By the way, I should’ve mentioned this, I think as you stabbed the sword in the beast, Duck, you were far enough away to stay out of the fire, but as it sort of emerges from its cocoon, I think it whips around, and that tail— that razor-sharp tail slashes across you for 3 Harm.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Which I guess would just be 1 Harm, because you are tough.
Justin: Did I— real quick, point of order, how does recovering Harm work?
Griffin: You were at zero Harm. The injuries—
Justin: I had two that held over, but is it, like, per engagement, sort of?
Griffin: Really, it’s per injury. So, if you have, like, these minor injuries, which the fight that you had with the beast last time, the injuries you sustained were minor injuries? Those you treat overnight or whatever. Bigger hits, if Ned or Aubrey take that three-Harm hit, they’re gonna need to do something about it, or else things can get bad. A three-Harm hit is, like, a real bad, like, bruised rib or something. Anything past four Harm, you need to go to the hospital, because you are then Unstable.
Justin: Four or more, not past four. Four or more.
Griffin: Right, right, right.
Justin: Right. But, like, I recover the injuries [Griffin: Yeah—] as long as they’re below [Griffin: Yeah, yeah.] three— below four, I recover overnight or whatever.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Yeah, I think you just like, go back and, y’know, put on a band-aid and you’re more or less good to go. So, Ned, roll to Kick Some Ass.
Clint: Kick Some Ass, all right… [rolls dice] it is an eight, and I have zero Tough, so… eight! So I pull it out of the holster, I point it at his head, and I say:
Ned: You feelin’ lucky, punk?
Justin: Fun.
Griffin: And I imagine you then pull the trigger? That’s when you do it?
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, you shoot this thing right in the face! What’s the Harm on your revolver?
Clint: The revolver is two Harm!
Griffin: Yeah, you point this gun at its face and pull the trigger, and there is another spray of black slime, and I think all three of you are, for a moment, like, temporarily kind of deafened, as the sound of this gunshot just, like, explodes in this cavern. It is indescribably loud, and the beast rears back, and takes this shot head-on, no pun intended, and as it comes back down from rearing back, I think it hits you with one of its claws— it has this, like, lizard-like form, but its two front arms end in these deadly claws, that I think it just, like, jabs into you, which knocks you backwards, but it also hits you for two Harm.
Ned: Ow! Oh, oh, oh, ow, ow!
Griffin: You are knocked away from the fire in the center of the room, and we jump to Aubrey. Aubrey, the fire in this room is now burning I think a lot hotter than you originally anticipated? This cavern is actually starting to get a bit sweltering? And smoke is accumulating in the top of the chamber as the beast reels back from Ned, and it kinda comes down a few feet closer to this blaze. It’s nothing that is, like, posing any threat to you right now, though. What do you do?
Travis: Is there any system, like, bloodied or anything in this game to know, like, “Now is the time for finishing moves!”?
Griffin: How close it is? No, not really, everything like that— and this covers a lot of stuff like this in this game, is all narrative. This thing— you can tell— you have burned away its armor. That gunshot would not have done as much damage if it still had that patchwork pelt, but because of the trap you guys laid and the stuff that you did, it now no longer has that armor. So it is exposed, and you know what it’s weak against, and you’ve dealt a shit-ton of damage to it so far.
Travis: Okay, um… I’m just gonna shoot fire at it again, I guess!
Griffin: So this is your first time using your magic as a Kick Some Ass attack. [Travis: Yeah…] I wanna make it clear: Spellcaster has Use Magic, which you can do to sort of create these different effects that you pick from a list. If you want to use your magic attack that you created when you made your character, your fire blast, all those tags you chose, it is a Kick Some Ass roll, but you just do something completely different than the other characters.
Travis: Yes. You are correct. Well, she looks this thing in the eye, and she says:
Aubrey: Three thousand years ago, on the banks of the Nile, the Egyptian priests believed that if a person were to—
Griffin: It just screams at you.
Aubrey: I am that person. That’s what I was getting— anyways, fire!
Travis: And then… [rolls dice] Okay! So that’s a 10…
Justin: Nice!
Travis: Well, it’s eight plus two, for Weird, 10. On a 10 or above, the fire doesn’t spread, which is super cool, and she does, like, the same, y’know, snap to create the thing, fire, hands, misdirection, all that same shit that she does in her act to shoot a blast of flame at this motherfucker. And so the Base is Blast, so it’s two Harm, and Effect is Fire, which adds two Harm fire to it, so four Harm.
Griffin: Okay. And what’s your bonus effect, ‘cause this is also a Kick Some Ass roll, so you get somethin’ special for what you rolled. ‘Cause this thing’s gonna hit you back, so the effects are: you gain the advantage, take plus one Forward or give plus one Forward to another player, you inflict terrible Harm, you suffer less Harm, or you force them where you want them.
Travis: Y’know, I’m gonna go with terrible Harm.
Griffin: All right. A popular choice for everyone.
Travis: Well, it’s— this is final battle shit, y’know?
Griffin: Yeah, sure. Okay, that is five Harm total. Because you have Blast, which has the tags Obvious, Loud, I think it’s even louder than the gunshot that just went off. I think— again, all of your senses are now kind of reeling—
Travis: I also want you to just picture that when that goes off, the first time it being Aubrey’s doing it, like, in anger and then she’s just laughing hysterically after it happens, [Griffin: Okay.] like “Did you see that?! What was that?!”
Griffin: Alright, it— you’re cackling laughing as this explosion goes off in the center of the room, and this thing takes five huge Harm. And it takes this damage and reels backwards, and you can actually see inside of its, like, black carapace? You actually see, like, this faint orange light for just a second? Which kind of fades away as it comes back down to the ground. And as it comes back down to the ground, Aubrey, it doesn’t slash at you with its claws, I think it just, like, headbutts you? And you go flying backwards, and as you sort of smash against the cave wall, several feet away from where you were just standing, you kinda bust your head against the wall and land down on the ground, and take two Harm for that.
Aubrey: Ow…
Griffin: Duck, you see your new friend Aubrey, Torch Girl, as you call her, get tossed backwards— ragdolled by this thing after she explodes it again. You are holding the blade in your hand, and what do you do?
Justin: What’s my sort of— which way is the beast facing? Which way…?
Griffin: Not towards you, I think the beast is still facing toward Aubrey, you’re standing kind of off to the side, just a few feet away, this is kinda tight quarters, so you’re not too super far away from this thing.
Justin: Okay, I will… I guess I’m gonna try to tackle it. Yeah, I think that’s what I’m gonna try to do. I’m gonna take a run at it from the side, with Beacon and try to knock it off balance.
Griffin: In any particular direction?
Justin: To its side. I’m basically just tryin’ to get its attention with stabbing.
Griffin: So what we could do here is we can do an assist roll, right? Instead of you traditionally trying to Kick Some Ass, if you wanna try to find a way to help out the other players by hindering the monster, you could do Help Out, where you can grant them advantages if you succeed. Which I think is narratively more interesting than you just continuing to slash and slash and slash at it.
Justin: Yeah. Here’s what I’m gonna do, okay. I am going to tackle the beast and try to occupy it so I can give Ned a real clean shot at it.
Griffin: Okay. Uh, cool. Go ahead and roll to Help Out, this is plus Cool.
Justin: [rolls dice] Seven and then Duck’s Cool is… two.
Griffin: Okay, so that’s a nine—
Travis: Man, Duck’s really Cool!
Griffin: Yeah, on a mixed success, your help grants whoever you try to help out plus one to their roll, but you expose yourself to trouble or danger, which is fucking fantastic.
Justin: Great.
Griffin: And so you have— I mean, to continue the thread of Monster Hunter talk on this program, have you mounted the monster? Explain to me, like, where you—
Justin: Yes, I’ve mounted the monster, I should also mention that I put on my Bandit Cloak before I did this so I can carve off some trade-in materials.
Griffin: Yeah, sure, so you can get lots of sick drops.
Travis: Yeah.
Clint: [confused] What the hell are you talkin’ about?
Travis: Oh, we gotta get you on Monster Hunter, Dad.
Griffin: Yeah, don’t worry about it. Alright, Ned, you see Duck run and tackle into the monster and it sort of lurches to the side a bit as Duck collides with it, and you see Duck is now on top of this big, slimy beast, granting you a pretty nice opening for whatever you decide to do next. And you will have plus one on whatever this roll is, as long as you are sort of using this window that Duck has opened up for you.
Duck: Hey, uh, Ned, if you have any options other than shooting it, I would just endorse those so fully, man— like, you have no idea how little I want you to shoot this fuckin’ thing!
Ned: [exaggerated] Oh, I get you, friend!
Duck: No, I- this is not sarcasm, please, Ned, for the love of Christ—
Ned: You- you don’t—?
Duck: Hey, listen, if you wanna say I didn’t think through this, that’s completely fair, we can totally, uh, sorta debrief afterwards, but please, somethin’ other than shooting!
Ned: So you do want me to shoot it.
Duck: Oh my god. Aw, Chr— well that’s it, this is where I wrap up, huh? Alright, well… them’s the breaks, I guess.
Griffin: Ned, what do you do?
Clint: [exasperated] Oh, god! Um… alright, so, if Ned can’t shoot it because Duck told him not to… okay, I know, the big heavy walkin’ stick! I’m gonna jam it right down this thing’s throat, just ram it right down whatever it has left of a mouth and a throat. This heavy wood walking stick. Just like a giant tongue depressor! Just ram it right down its throat!
Griffin: Cool, roll to Kick Some Ass and you will get plus one on this roll because of what Duck set up there. Plus your normal Tough roll.
Clint: [rolls dice] Okay, well my Tough is zero, my roll is 11, plus one makes a 12!
Griffin: Jesus, these fuckin’ rolls!
Clint: Swear to god! I love these new die!
Griffin: Pick an extra effect from the list for Kicking Some Ass so very good.
Clint: I think… no, I’m gonna pass it forward. I’m gonna pay it forward. Pay it forward to Aubrey.
Griffin: Okay, you grant Aubrey plus one Forward on her next roll, as you jam this thing down the monster’s throat. And as you do so, I think it rears its head to the side and kind of, like, yelps? As much as it can yelp with a giant walking stick down its throat? In pain, and then when it brings its head back around, it just smashes into you, and I think it probably just does one Harm as you are knocked backward. And as it does that, Duck, you’re also kinda tossed from its back and you land several feet away, and as you hit the cave floor, you also take one Harm.
Clint: How many Harmses do I get?
Griffin: Seven. But once you’ve taken four, it’s serious damage.
Justin: And Griff, please, if a Harm is below two, please don’t bother me with it.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: [chuckles] Okay. And now this thing is looking super not good.
Travis: I know what I wanna do, I know what I wanna do! I want to Enchant A Weapon and set that walking stick on fire!
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Yeah. Okay. Roll to Use Magic.
Travis: [rolls dice] Well that didn’t work, but I’m gonna use my Luck here, ‘cause I really wanna do this.
Griffin: ...Okay! You’re spending a point of Luck to bump it up to 12.
Travis: Yeah, I think this is a big finishing move…
Griffin: Yeah, I love it. Mark Luck, and you have spent one Luck.
Travis: Hey, and I wanna do a cool line.
Griffin: Yeah, yeah, do a cool line.
Aubrey: Fuego, ya bastard!
Griffin: The monster lands on the floor with this walking stick in its throat, just kind of barely emerging from its mouth, and Aubrey, you’re laying on the floor right in front of it, and you just sit up and you grab the walking stick with your hand and we see it glow, and as it glows a bright orange, I think the chamber goes silent as we watch the inside of this monster glow; softly at first, and then brighter and bright orange, and then, in a spray of black mist, the beast explodes.
And as it explodes, I think all three of you are flung backwards, away from the beast as this wave of force shoots out at you, and Aubrey, because you were right up against the wall, I think you smash up against the wall again, and you bang your head again, and as you land on the floor, you roll a couple feet as you bounce off of it. The scene around you just kind of starts coming to you in flashes. You see Duck and Ned struggle to climb to a kneeling position, you see the smoke that was filling this chamber is spreading much faster now, this fire has grown wild, and the smoke is filling your lungs, and now you’re kind of unable to catch your breath, and in another flash, you look toward the mouth of the cave, and you see that wall of fire still roaring high, and as your vision finally fades, you see a figure appear in the fire. You see a large woman wrapped in her duster leaping through the flames in your direction, and then you lose consciousness.
{Ad break 53:52 to 61:13}
Griffin: Aubrey, the next day comes to you in waves. You find consciousness in these brief flashes again. A nurse comes in to check your charts. Ned and Duck swing by for a visit. A different nurse changes your IV, and in one of these flashes of consciousness, there’s Mama. And she’s in the hospital bed next to yours and her hair is a bit singed, and she’s wearing an oxygen mask, but she’s otherwise no worse for wear. And she’s holding your hand, and she’s smiling behind her mask. And then in another flash, it’s morning, and Mama’s bed is empty.
And Barclay’s sitting in the corner, and he’s reading a Lamplighter. And as you start to stir, as you finally wake up, you see him peek over the paper, and he looks a bit startled, and he says:
Barclay: Welcome back!
Aubrey: Where’s Mama?
Barclay: Oh, she’s— she’s fine. She ran off last night, asked me to come in and stand vigil.
Aubrey: And Dr. Harris Bonkers, how’s Dr. Harris Bonkers?
Barclay: Dr. Harris Bonkers is back at the lodge. Dani’s watching him.
Aubrey: [relieved] Okay.
Barclay: Mama said she had to run an errand. She, um, she actually left you something.
Griffin: And he reaches into a jacket he’s wearing, a big peacoat, and he pulls out a piece of paper. You can actually tell that it’s a medical chart that has been, like, folded up and written on. Your name is written on the outside of this letter. He hands it over to you, and he says:
Barclay: I’ll go tell the nurse that you’re up. Any luck, uh—
Aubrey: Get me some Jello.
Barclay: Yeah, I’ll make sure to score you some Jello, don’t worry about that.
Aubrey: Lime! Make sure it’s lime, please. This is important!
Griffin: He laughs. He says:
Barclay: I talked to ‘em. They said any luck, I can take you back to the lodge tonight to recuperate. Aubrey, you did… unbelievably well last night.
Aubrey: Then get me two Jellos!
[Laughter]
Griffin: He laughs, and he walks out of the room. And you open Mama’s letter. And it reads:
Mama: You and I don’t know each other very well yet, Aubrey Little, so you’ll have to take my word for it that I’m not the kind of person who finds themselves satisfied or impressed by the exploits of other folks very easily. I’m quick to shut folks out, and I know that. This life I live requires it. But Aubrey, I am proud beyond belief to know you. You did something last night that few folks can do. And I’m not talking about shooting fireballs outta your hands or slaying a monster the size of a Volvo, either. I’m talking about the moment that you decided to step foot into that cave.
You did something hard last night, something scary, and necessary, and you did it without hesitating. Not for a second. And that courage, Aubrey… I’d say you remind me of myself when I was younger if I didn’t think it made me sound like a self-flattering old fart, but yeah, you know. Life is tough for everyone who lives it. Not just this glamorous life of monster hunting, Aubrey. All of it. Everyone’s. Most folks just stumble through it feeling lost and directionless, no sense of purpose. I know that feeling all too well, before I started doing this work. Before the lodge.
We don’t know each other very well, Aubrey, but I know a calling when I see one. You belong here, at the lodge. You belong in the Pine Guard, protecting this world alongside me and Barclay. And Ned, and Duck too; I’m pretty sure those two wouldn’t last a second in these woods without you. I’m hoping this letter finds you in the same enthusiastic mood I saw when I first met you, Aubrey, ‘cause I got kinda a big ask.
Stay here. Help us fight back against the dark. You keep at it, I promise I will help you find out where your powers come from, just as soon as I get back. Oh, right. I gotta leave. Just for… just for a bit. Barclay will get you set up while I’m gone. I got some unfinished business needs taking care of, and that’s all I can say about that right now. I’ll catch you up next time I see you.
I’m reading this letter back right now, and I realize it’s all sounding a bit melodramatic, so you’ll have to forgive me for that. I don’t wanna scare you away with a bunch of talk about saving the world. See, in my experience, that’s a bit too intangible a goal for someone to fight for anyway. That’s the advice I’m gonna leave you with, Aubrey. When you’re out there toe to toe with some demon and you find yourself asking what you’re doing it all for, just do what I do. I don’t think about the world, Aubrey. I think about Amnesty Lodge.
[music begins playing]
I think about it on a nice day. Dani’s out in the garden outside, and it’s in full bloom. There’s a breeze off the river pouring in through the windows, carrying the song that Moira’s playing at the piano through the whole building. Jake and Barclay are back in the springs, and Jake’s howling about the X Games or some shit. And all these folks, folks who thought their lives were finished once… they’re together. They’re happy. They’re safe.
I don’t know about you, Aubrey, but to me? That sounds like a place worth fighting for.
Griffin: And as you lower the letter, you see your jacket slung over the chair in the corner of your hospital room. And it’s a bit roughed up after your eventful evening, but it’s held together. And through the arms of the chair, you can see inside the lapel, and you see, sewn into the fabric, the Pine Guard patch.
Duck, you’re home the night after the hunt, how’re you doin’?
Justin: Pretty shaken up, I think. I think that Duck maybe doesn’t… I’m not gonna say “wasn’t in control,” but he was more capable than he sorta thought he would be, and I think it’s left him a little unnerved.
Griffin: My next question is very important for me to know because I’m very excited to hear the answer. Where do you even put a talking sword in your apartment?
Justin: Where do I put the talking sword in my apartment? Well…
Griffin: Do you stuff it in a box in the closet despite its protests, or do you sort of give it a nice little habitat?
Justin: No, I— [chuckles] I put it up with the coffee mugs. It’s kinda stuffed up there above the coffee mugs.
Griffin: [chuckles] Okay. In a cabinet you can shut?
Justin: Yeah, but I leave it open, ‘cause I feel like I probably— I probably owe Beacon that, at least.
Griffin: Yeah, I think Beacon’s very grateful when you put him up there and give him a little sunlight—
Justin: [chuckling] Oh, no, he’s still being really shitty about it, [Griffin: Oh, okay, great.] but he does appreciate that, at least, I can tell.
Griffin: I think we see you there, in the kitchen, just doin’ some chores the night after the hunt, and you walk out back into the living room and, in a flash, there’s Minerva, still a blue, glowing silhouette standing in your living room. And she’s got her back turned to you as you enter but she quickly reorients herself and faces you, and she takes a beat and she says:
Minerva: [thrilled] Duck Newton!
Duck: Oh, god.
Minerva: You’re different! You’ve embraced your destiny, haven’t you?
Duck: Yeah, I guess.
Griffin: She gives this big, hearty laugh, and she says:
Minerva: Are you still afraid, Duck Newton?
Duck: Y’know… I think I’m more afraid.
Minerva: More afraid? Even with the weapon of destiny clutched in your hand?
Duck: Yeah. I mean, in the moment, it’s more kind of an annoyance, but now that it’s sorta… I feel like I opened a door that I don’t know how to shut. And, for a long time, havin’ a closed door was enough. But I don’t know how to walk this back, and I’m not crazy about that feeling.
Griffin: She looks contemplative, for maybe the first time you’ve ever seen from Minerva? And she says:
Minerva: I can understand that, but be not afraid, Duck Newton. You possess a weapon far greater than those wielded by your foes! You have me in your corner!
Duck: And what does that get me, exactly?
Minerva: A friendship you will learn to treasure, Duck Newton.
Griffin: She gives a big, bellowing laugh again, and she says:
Minerva: Duck Newton, your destiny is larger than you can possibly comprehend, my friend. With your bravery and my expert tutelage, you will find the strength you require to save—
Griffin: And just like that, Minerva disappears.
[guitar music plays]
And, somewhere far, far away, we see Minerva. We actually see her, not just her shadow. She’s about six feet tall, head shaved and decorated with paint in an intricate pattern down to her forehead, she’s wearing a blue tunic over some bulky armor, and she’s standing on this glowing circle in a dark chamber, and she’s speaking to a silhouette in the rough shape of Duck Newton! And, in a flash, Duck’s shadow disappears as Minerva was mid-sentence, and now she’s alone in this place as the circle below her grows dim. And she closes her eyes and she sighs and she stays like that, almost meditative, for several seconds. And then she opens her eyes and smiles at the progress her counterpart has made. And, with several large strides, she walks toward the wall of this chamber, and she slides open a window, and we see her there, smiling as the faint orange light from outside beams down on her face as she’s filled, for the first time in a long time, with hope.
[guitar continues for a few seconds, then fades out]
Ned, you have returned after taking a well-earned day off from the Cryptonomica. You arrive with a chime from the bell above the door, and we see your museum, and it’s as clean as the day you bought it. You see Kirby walking around with a rag, just sort of finishing up getting everything polished up right before you open the store up to the general public, and he sees you enter, and he says:
Kirby: Hey boss, you feelin’ better?
Ned: I feel… pretty good. Y’know, thankfully the— my Chewbacca suit took a brunt of the blow, but I’m— I’m feeling good! Feelin’ fine, like cherry wine.
Griffin: He says:
Kirby: You told me yesterday that you were takin’ a sick day, why were you wearin’ your Chewbacca suit?
Ned: Uh, y’know what, [chuckling] I’ve kinda gotten to the point where I like it!
[Griffin chuckles]
Ned: I just, uh, y’know, it’s, uh, tapered, y’know, it’s not like your standard Chewbacca suit. It’s, like, one of those, uh, one of those form-fitting ones, and I think it kinda accents my— I have some pretty big shoulders, so, uh…
Griffin: He chuckles, and he says:
Kirby: Well, I kept the shop up and runnin’ yesterday, got the place cleaned up, lookin— sorry, museum, got the museum up and lookin’ good, did a bit of deep cleaning, uh, you should really consider dusting this place a little more often than you do? Which is, I’m assuming, literally never?
Ned: Nnnnever. Never. It adds to the ambiance; the dust, the cobwebs. C’mon, do you know nothing of showmanship?
Griffin: And the two of you are having a bit of debate about cleanliness, as the bell above the door rings again. And, a young woman enters the room, she’s got a camera strapped around her neck and she’s got a hiking pack and she says:
Tourist: Is this the Cryptonomica?
Ned: [dramatic] Welcome to the stygian darkness that is the Cryptonomica! As you enter, you will be faced with mind-boggling sights, things that threaten your very sanity! Welcome, welcome.
Griffin: I think you’re giving this spiel as a second person walks in. An older man, also carrying a hiking pack, and he walks in and I think he just starts looking around at the exhibits. And you have never seen, I think, two customers in this store at the same time, and Kirby smiles and he says:
Kirby: I think our financial troubles are behind us.
Griffin: And he kinda waves you to come over to his desk. And you approach, and he opens up his computer. And you see the computer is open to his web page, thelamplighter.org, and he gives the page a quick refresh, and I think you’re both startled by the number that you see on the screen: 186,000 views.
[Amnesty Theme fades in]
Kirby was impressed with the footage that you shot with this camera: you and your Bigfoot costume, fighting a bobcat? But, still, he never expected it to actually go viral. And now you see the description to this footage: “For the full video, visit the Cryptonomica. 43 Bedlam Lane, “Kepler, West Virginia.”

[The Water, Arrival by Griffin McElroy plays]
Griffin: Moonlight pours through the broad skylights above the Kepler High School pool, and onto the back of Calvin Owens, captain of the Kepler High swim team. He cuts quiet laps through the water, training vigorously for the Pocahontas County swim meet, just four days away. A window over the stacked-up bleachers is propped open by a duffel bag containing a change of clothes, evidence of Calvin’s trespassing in pursuit of a few dozen more practice laps. He breaches the surface and clings to the edge of the pool, panting. He reaches up with trembling, tired fingers, and peels off his goggles and cap, then lays his head down on crossed arms, attempting to catch his breath before pushing his luck for one last set. And for a moment, he is surrounded with silence. Floating in the waters that would be his proving grounds in just a few short days, he pushes his nerves aside, and granting himself a moment of weightless serenity, Calvin Owens exhales a long, contented sigh.
And then he is pulled violently below the surface of the water.
And now the silence of the gym is nearly absolute; there’s just the soft rustling of the pine trees outside and the small ripples that remain on the surface of the pool, which lap lazily against its edges. And then a splash as Calvin resurfaces, gulping air into his burning lungs as he lunges toward the ladder out of the pool. He leaps onto the edge and scrambles up the side of the bleachers, his body aching with exhaustion, and yanks his bag out of the propped-open window, swinging his leg over its sill. But before he makes his escape, his curiosity consumes him. He pauses, and surveys the waters below. His mind cannot comprehend what it sees.
The surface of the water grows convex, lurching upward from the center of the pool and pulling away from its perimeter. It grows slowly like this until it forms a mound that reaches ten feet above its former surface, and then, without warning, this shape begins moving in Calvin’s direction.
The window slams shut, as Calvin springs outside. He hits the ground running, and vanishes into the trees that surround his school.
The nearly-full moon over Kepler, West Virginia illuminates this scene from its ambivalent place in the twilit sky.

{3:21}
Justin: Woah, I’m being sucked into a portal! I’m going all the way from West Virginia to— Oh.
Clint: West Virginia, yeah.
Travis: Aw, man, I’m being sucked, too! I’m going to West Virginia too!
Justin: We’re both being sucked! Dad, are you being sucked too?
Travis: [crosstalk] We’re being sucked!
Clint: No! And I wouldn’t admit it if I was!
Griffin: And I’m the portal— the portal master, who made the suck.
Justin: Griffin, why did you transport me to the state I’m already in?
Griffin: Well, technically you’re 45 minutes east or so… of where you are. So that’s exotic.
Clint: There’s all those warrants too, Juice. You can’t really cross state lines.
Griffin: Yeah, and now you’re in pepperoni roll country, ba-by.
Justin: Now listen— This is pepperoni roll country right here. I’m here. I’m living in it.
Clint: [crosstalk] It's the official snack!
Griffin: So it’s MaxFun Drive, and it’s our first episode kind of back in Amnesty— what we officially know now as season two, and— Hey, who here remembers what Amnesty was all about? Because it’s been… three months?
Travis: I think it was all about a young woman named Aubrey Little-
Griffin: And her journey and two, sort of side characters, sort of ancillary characters, supporting her quest.
Travis: Yes. They’re there to make her look good.
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: Also, here’s a really fun thing, ‘cause you often see this when you go from pilot to season: I can’t remember what Aubrey’s voice sounded like, so it’s going to be completely different now, probably.
Griffin: Also because you’re sick. Now Travis has the Episode 1 Sickness. Would you all like a quick refresher on what this is all about and then we can talk about what the MaxFun Drive is and then start doing the episode?
Justin: Yes.
Clint: I agree.
Griffin: You all are in Kepler, West Virginia, that’s the setting for this story, where all of you have kind of been collected. Ned, you lived in town already, you run a kind of cryptid museum called the Cryptonomica. And Duck, you’ve lived here— Has Duck lived here his whole life?
Clint: So far.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: So Ned works at the Cryptonomica, Duck works at the Monongahela National Forest as a park ranger—
Clint: [over Griffin] And we’re buddies! We’re friends.
Griffin: You’re buddies? Well you’re all friends now, I think. Or at least casual acquaintances.
Clint: Well, apparently I’m a sidekick to Aubrey.
Travis: That’s correct.
Griffin: I was goofing. Come on, you’re all important in God’s eyes. And Aubrey, you are a travelling sort of— sort of magician starting her career who was brought to Kepler when she developed actual magic powers.
Travis: That’s a twist, right? Because before now, she was doing stage magic, but then what’s that? Actual magic? No one’s ever done that before in a story, ya welcome.
Griffin: Actual, practical magic. [Travis: Yeah.] So you all were— You all sort of came to know Mama, who is the proprietor of the Amnesty Lodge— It’s actually just “Amnesty Lodge”, I need to stop saying “the Amnesty Lodge”. That’s like calling it “the Motel 6”. That’s weird, right?
Travis: Wait, is Amnesty Lodge a chain? Are there other Amnesty Lodges around?
Griffin: No, there’s just this one, and it is— it plays home to a number of… well, monsters, who hail from a world called Sylvane, which is accessible—
Travis: We still need to come up with a better word than like “abominations” and “monsters”. “Alternative beings”?
Griffin: Alternative—
Clint: I thought we had “bom-boms”.
Travis: “Bom-boms” got voted down.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, it’s all terrible. Which, Sylvane is accessible through a stone archway which is in the middle of the woods. And every two months or so, when the full moon— around the time of the full moon, these big, nasty abominations come through. And it’s up to the Pine Guard to defeat them quietly, because nobody else can know about Sylvane’s existence. Because what would happen if you found out there was a world full of monsters that was connected to our own? There would be chaos.
Travis: I would feel very satisfied— very vindicated.
Griffin: Sure, there would certainly be people like that. But the reason for the secrecy that the Pine Guard operates under is because they are worried about, you know… war. And so y’all slayed a monster, slayed an abomination and won the day. And Mama sort of disappeared on some sort of secret mission. Duck has sort of had a conversation with Minerva, who is his invisible friend? It’s visible to him— she’s visible to him, but to nobody else. And we learned that she’s somewhere? She— exists somewhere? And in the last scene, Ned, you found out that Kirby posted the video of the real Bigfoot, Barclay, fighting a bobcat. Which is a small cat, and I’M VERY SORRY! I didn’t know! I confused bobcat and mountain lion! It happens to the best of us.
Travis: Oh shit. I knew that the whole time and I thought you were doing that on purpose, like it was a monster version of a bobcat.
Clint: Yeah, I thought it was an oversized—
Griffin: [crosstalk] OK, yeah, there we go. There we go.
Clint: As a matter of fact, I think you would even call it a robert cat.
Griffin: A robert cat. The monster fluid got in the bobcat, turned it into a monster. Okay— um, any questions before we hop in?
Travis: How long has it been since the—
Griffin: It’s been two months. We’re kind of getting to the next monster cycle, which comes every two months or so. So we’re gonna do like, a quick catch-up scene with all of you and then— not go five episodes before getting you all together. I’m going to do that after we do, like, a little catch-up, because I want to know what your characters have been doing in this place for the last two months.
Clint: So what time of year is it?
Griffin: It’s October.
Travis: Ooh, it’s spooooky.
Griffin: Yeah, it’s the spookiest month, historically. Uh, let’s talk about the MaxFun Drive though, before we do the story. {{8:58 - 9:51}}
Griffin: Uh, let’s start with Aubrey. Aubrey, when last we saw you, you were kind of banged up from the monster encounter. It’s been two months, I imagine you have recovered since then. And it’s October now, and in the last two months, Mama has not returned yet from— whatever mission she embarked on. But with her sort of, last letter she implored you to stay at Amnesty Lodge and help them in their plight while you sort of discover the truth of your magic powers. So I’m curious to hear what Aubrey’s been doing for the last two months, and in there maybe we can find a scene that we can do.
Travis: [sarcastic] She’s been binging Netflix. Just really takin’ some her-time, not doin’ much.
Griffin: Watching Stranger Things for, like, strategic tips and stuff?
Travis: No, mostly just, like, cooking shows and documentaries- no, she has been practicing—
Griffin: Zumbo’s Just Desserts. I’m pretty sure Zumbo is a cryptid, ‘cause no human can make cakes like that.
Travis: I picture, like, with Barclay’s help, setting up kinda strawmen, y’know, and doing some target practice, y’know, flingin’ spells and trying to really control it, and being able to do it without having, like, the spreading danger and really trying to find where the line is of the power and, like, how much she can rely on it.
Griffin: Okay. So just practicing your magic abilities— is it going well?
Travis: I would say it is… passably well. Here’s another thing I wanna— just like last time, I wanted the characters to use the restroom, I also don’t want this to be like in Doctor Strange where it’s like “Oh now I get it, and now I’m super awesome at magic!”
Griffin: No, yeah, I think that’s very— I think that’s probably how it would work, right? [Travis: Yeah.] Like, it’s not something you just “Oh, now I’m a master magician.”
Travis: I would also say that maybe in there, she’s been, like, learning about Sylvane and and she’s been learning about the alternative… people, the alternative beings, in the Lodge, and so she’s been maybe cozying up to Dani a little bit, as a bit of, like, “Now tell me about them, what’s going on here?”
Griffin: Alright, we can do that scene. Like, I think that would be good, I think you doing target practice would be cool too, but you just, like, having a conversation about Sylvane and stuff might be good. So how about this:
You’re… you and Dani are in the woods, not too far from the Lodge, I think it’s probably in sight, there’s a creek that runs along behind the Amnesty Lodge—[correcting himself] behind Amnesty Lodge, dammit—and the two of you are out there, just sort of hikin’ around, I think Dani’s sort of been helping you get acclimated to Kepler first and foremost. Like, this is a town that you have not lived in and so you’re sort of still trying to wrap your head around the landscape and what the town’s all about. And the two of you are looking for… ramps? Do ramps exist in October- I think it’s a springtime food. But because of the magic from the gateway—
Travis: Oh, I thought you meant, like, sick bicycle ramps. “We’re gonna skateboard off some ramps.”.
Griffin: No, like the tasty onions.
Travis: I don’t know what that is.
Griffin: Uh, it’s like an Appalachian delicacy.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Okay, anyway—
Clint: There’s a ramp festival every year.
Griffin: There’s a ramp festival, but I think it’s in spring, but because of the magical stone gate, they also grow in October.
Travis: Could we be also looking for sick skateboarding ramps?
Griffin: Yeah, I think you’re looking for both…
Clint: Only if you have Jake Coolice with you.
Griffin: I think Jake Coolice heard you were going out looking for ramps, and he showed up with his shorts and his cool board…
Clint: [endeared] Oh, Jake.
Griffin: … And his knee pads and helmet, ‘cause he’s safe, and then Dani was like “No, they’re onions, Barclay wanted ‘em for cooking.” and he was like “Aw, well I can’t grind on those!” and he went back inside. And he cried in his room!
Travis: Oh no!
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Oh no, you hate to hear that.
Griffin: So the two of you are out in the woods looking for these stinky onions, and you are talking to her about Sylvane.
Travis: Also, just to picture— I’ve been imagining this kind of, like, training exercise that’s also become a nervous fidget for her, where it’s like a little flame on the tip of her index finger that she passes back and forth between index fingers.
Griffin: Alright, I dig that.
Travis: Yeah, so kind of controlling—
Griffin: Are you doing that right now?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay. So what do you wanna know from Dani about Sylvane?
Aubrey: Okay, so, one more time, tell me again, you are a…?
Dani: Well, I’m… I guess I’m Sylvan, like, 100%, there’s sort of different types of beings over there—
Aubrey: Yeah yeah yeah, yeah, but, like, a werewolf? Vampire?
Dani: Okay, yeah, I know, I get what you’re— see, those are your terms, and it’s weird, because—
Aubrey: Oh.
Dani: —you kinda have those terms because we came over, and you made them up, but I guess, um… I mean, I guess a lot of us would be vampires. Not in the way that— not like, the, you know, Dracula type?
Aubrey: Uh huh?
Dani: I can’t turn into bats. I can do some cool stuff, but like… yeah. Vampire. Sharp teeth, when I need them—
Griffin: And she… what’s she have? I think she has a ring. And she takes that off, and you see her Sylvan form, where she has those sharp teeth, and kind of orange eyes. Not exactly like the two-fanged vamp that, uh, we kind of know about, but she transforms in front of your eyes. She’s like:
Dani: Yeah, so, vampire.
Aubrey: Sick!
Dani: Yeah, it’s, uh, it’s pretty cool.
Aubrey: Okay, so this is a weird question, but is there any way… is there any way to recognise— like, without someone taking off their accessory, say, like, oh yeah, that’s a Bigfoot, that’s a vampire, that’s a…
Dani: No. I mean, that’s why they exist, they help us live here. I mean, don’t—you don’t need, like a Voigt-Kampff test on this, it’s pretty much just the folks livin’ in Amnesty Lodge. I feel like a lot of people saw Men in Black, and then just assumed that there were, like, aliens and monsters walking— no. It’s pretty much just us. It would be tough— it’s tough to survive in this world without a little bit of help, and Amnesty Lodge sorta provides that to us. Specifically, so… I think the most important thing you need to know— and I know you’re curious about how Sylvans work— we can’t really live without some sort of sustaining life force. And over in—
Aubrey: Like food?
Dani: It could be food. There’s traces of that stuff in there, but in Sylvane, we all sort of subsist on, well, Sylvane itself. On the planet. And—
Aubrey: You eat the dirt????
Dani: No, we don’t eat the dirt. We just sort of absorb its energy.
Aubrey: Like photosynthesis.
Dani: [laughs] Yeah, I guess if you want to frame it like that, it’s a little bit like photosynthesis. And obviously, over here we don’t get that, and so I think that’s why you get a lot of the, you know, vampire biting, feeding, that stuff that has happened sometimes, and has been kind of unfortunate and has painted a pretty bad picture of me and how I sort of live. Um… But—
Aubrey: So do you have to bounce over from time to time and, like, recharge and come back?
Griffin: She, uh, she looks a little sad when you say that. She’s like
Dani: I… I can’t go back, Aubrey. I'm an exile. We’re… [Aubrey: Oh…] we’re forbidden. Yeah. Um…
Aubrey: I’m sorry. I— I… yeah.
Dani: Once you— once you leave Sylvane, you’re not really allowed to cross back over. Um… But anyway, no. I— You know the springs behind Amnesty Lodge? The— [Aubrey: Yes.] the hot springs? Yeah, those— those have enough juice I think for a lot of us to keep going. So, quick soak in there and I’m good to go. So…
Aubrey: [hesitantly] Do you… Would you… Wanna go… take a soak? In the springs? I mean, we don't, if you don't, I know we have to get the ramps, so if you don’t… You know what, never mind. Forget it. Um…
Griffin: She reaches down and grabs, like, uh, like, there’s two really close together, which is… I don't know how ramps work, but I’m gonna say it's an uncommon occurrence. She pulls ‘em up, and I think y'all have a healthy bounty. And she’s like
Dani: No, that sounds great. Let's get these over to Barclay, get him working on that… whatever he’s gonna make. These things stink like hell [Aubrey laughs] but I’m sure he’s gonna make ‘em taste very good. And yeah, let’s go for a dip.
Aubrey: Sick.
{18:13}
Griffin: Um… Duck!
Justin: Yep.
Griffin: Duck, it’s been two months [Justin: It has.] since— since the events, since the last time. What have you been up to? I think Minerva’s still showing up on a fairly regular basis. I thought it might be interesting if… um… through like, I don't know, through the two of you just like figuring it out, um, if she managed to find a way to show up at like a regular time. Like, you know, 6:14 PM, sometime in the evening, and I can leave it to you to decide, but just like, that's— that— now it's consistent. Now Minerva shows up and you know what time she's gonna show up. It is not like this random visit thing, she now has a scheduled time. [crosstalk] She’s like—
Travis: [crosstalk] She shows up in time to watch Wheel with you.
Griffin: Yeah, she’s dialed it in, she catches the back half of Wheel. And it's probably not for a super long time, but like, how do you feel about that?
Justin: Yeah, that makes sense to me. Probably in the evening. I feel like— you said 6:14 kind of randomly, but I think that that… that feels right. 6:14. 6:14 every night.
Griffin: Alright. I think Minerva shows up at 6:14 every night, checks in. I think you… I mean, you still got Beacon, and that's… that's what it is.
Justin: And I think Duck has been like, in… he’s still doing his day to day. I think he probably jogs places more often than he used to stroll. Like… trying to sort of casually… get a little bit more physically, uh, fit. I think maybe in the woods once in a great while, he'll sort of like, practice with Beacon. You know, when he's sure no one’s around to look. To sort of, you know, get… knock the dust off a little bit, but it’s not like his prime focus. [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Hey, he’s got— he’s got a fuckin’ job.
Justin: He’s got a nine to five. Yeah.
Griffin: Has that been complicated by the fact that you… uh… also kind of have started to embrace your destiny a little bit?
Justin: Um… I think that he maybe has a sense of… wanting to have things in order. You know, just in case. In case he would have to abandon his post for some reason, or, God forbid, something were to happen to him. I think that he… um… maybe appreciates it more. ‘Cause it is also, like, a sort of bedrock of normalcy… um… in a world kinda gone crazy.
Griffin: How’s your training— how is your training going? I think it would be cool if, like, you… Minerva I think would be eager to train you. I think obviously— I think she only shows up for like three minutes. It is very… it is a short window that she appears to you. But it’s every— every day 6:14 to 6:17, she shows up and I think wants to— wants to sort of show you the ropes a little bit.
Justin: Yeah, and I think I see Minerva as like his personal trainer, who he’s kind of, like… blowing off. Like, the reason he does the stuff is so he can tell Minerva like “oh yeah, I’ve been practicing, like, running and… swords and stuff.”
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: It’s not… you know, it’s sort of like, Minerva’s there like, you know, “Have you been training?” and he’s like “oh yeah, yeah, yeah,” totally… [laughs] totally training really, yeah, for sure. Like, really grinding… grinding it out.
Griffin: Alright.
Travis: [crosstalk] Turning in all kinds of Crushbone Belts. You know.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: God, how often can we reference Crushbone Belts? [crosstalk] From EverQuest?
Travis: [crosstalk] As often as I want, dude.
Griffin: Okay. Um… I think I’d like the scene, if you’re cool with it, to be at some point within this two month span she stops taking the excuse of “yep, training, great” and actually wants to like, uh, like, spar with you… somewhere… for her three minute window.
Justin: Yeah, and I feel like she like, kicks his ass, like every time. And [clears throat] probably through that, towards the end of this… this period that we’re talking about, like, he gets tired of getting his ass kicked. Which is sort of the prompting for him doing the other stuff. Like for actually trying to get himself in slightly better shape and practice with Beacon or whatever. He’s tired of getting knocked around.
Griffin: Well, she’s a specter. She’s like a vision. I don’t think she has a physical form.
Justin: Yeah, but he knows when he’s beat.
Griffin: Yeah, okay. I think, uh, alright, let’s do one of these scenes that’s probably close to the end of this two month window. ‘Cause you’ve been— you’ve been training [Justin: Yes.] for a while. Where— where are you at?
Justin: And also don’t forget I need to do my, um… [clears throat] Destiny’s Plaything roll at some point.
Griffin: Oh, yeah, go ahead— go ahead and do that. That’s a good setup too. Um… ‘cause we’re, especially— [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Are you sure? ‘Cause if we’re flashing back it… okay.
Griffin: Um… yeah. I think, yeah. Go ahead— go ahead and do it. And then… we can—
Justin: Okay. For those of you… Destiny’s Play— At the beginning of every sort of like, thing I have to, uh… roll to see sort of what destiny is gonna tell me about—
Griffin: It is a super cool mechanic. So we’re using roll20 not for, sort of, visual things. We’re not gonna put up, like, things that you won’t be able to see. We’re mainly just doing it so we can see each other’s rolls. And I can see that Justin has rolled a 7. Plus… what is it, Weird?
Justin: Yeah, +Weird. Which is actually -1.
Griffin: Oh!
Justin: So… for— for Duck. So… [crosstalk] it’s a 6.
Griffin: [crosstalk] What do you— what do get on a failure for…
Justin: “Something bad is going to happen to you.”
Griffin: [laughing, high pitched] Oh no!
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: We just started!
Justin: Here we go. Here’s a little present for you, Griffin. I’ve— I’ve wrapped it and everything.
Griffin: Okay. That’s extremely good. Well, mark Experience.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Every time you fail a roll in Monster of the Week, which is the game we are playing [Justin: Crushing it already.] you mark Experience. Out of curiosity, did anybody rack up 5 XP? [crosstalk] You need to level up.
Travis: [crosstalk] No. [disappointed] I just got 1 last time.
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: That’s my second.
Griffin: Dad, where are you at, XP-wise?
Clint: [hesitant] You know… you know, I got a— I got a… I got a couple…
Justin: [pause] This is a much simpler system.
Griffin: [crosstalk] This is such a simpler system.
Travis: [crosstalk] Look at your character sheet.
Griffin: You gotta just do the shit.
Clint: I’m lookin’— I’m lookin’ at all my notes! I’m lookin’ at all my notes. I think I—
Justin: Look at your character sheet.
Clint: 2. 2.
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: I’ll do your vision after this scene. We’ll do the flashback and then we’ll do your vision.
Justin: ‘Kay.
Griffin: So, it’s- where you at when you’re doing this training?
Justin: Uh, out back.
Griffin: The Outback Steakhouse? Like, the parking lot, or, like, the kitchen?
Justin: [sarcastic] There’s a parking lot behind the Outback- no, I go out back of my house.
Griffin: Okay. Uh, your apartment?
Justin: Uh, yes. Yes, my apartment. There’s a sorta common area… but there’s only, like, three other apartments in the building, and I know when Mrs. Pearson usually packs it in at about- earlier in the evening…
Travis: [goofing] Now, what’s your relationship with Mrs. Pearson?
Griffin: [goofing] Yeah, let’s dial into that.
Justin: She is a sweet older lady, former police officer, actually, so she’s got a lotta great stories. Kepler’s first female police officer, actually. And so she’s got a lot of great stories about her time on the force, which Duck likes to hear. She likes to think she’s checkin’ up on him, to make sure he’s doin’ okay, because she still hasn’t lost the sort of protective nature that she developed over forty years on the force, but I think they kinda look out for each other.
Griffin: Damn, dude, we were just goofing, but that’s good shit.
Clint: That is real good shit!
Griffin: Okay! So you’re behind—
Travis: [goofing] Wait, hold on, slow-slow. Who else is in the building?
[Clint laughs]
Justin: I can tell you if ya want—
Clint: It’s Mr. Furley, Mr. Furley’s there.
Justin: No, Mr. Tarkesian, who runs the general store in town. Uh, and he—
Griffin: Justin, I have a fucking character list here in Scrivener and I’m having to update it- Mr. … Tarkesian?
Justin: Yeah, Mr. Tarkesian.
Griffin: [to himself] Alright, runs the grocery store.
Travis: General store.
Justin: Yeah, I mean, it’s a grocery store, general store, whatever. It says “Kepler General Store”, but that’s sort of, like, a nod to nostalgia. Y’know, it’s a grocery store. A small one-- you find those in small West Virginia towns, where the big chains have not come in, still, like, if you go to a place like McDowell county, you’ll find these, like, gas stations that are kinda like markets, combination gas stations-markets.
Clint: And combination bait shop. Lotta those.
Justin: Yeah, and a bait shop, for sure.
Griffin: There is a Pizza Hut in town, that is, I think, one of the few chains.
Clint: That’s canon.
Justin: Yeah. Pizza Hut is not necessarily a grocery store, but I can see [Griffin: Sure.] how, if your only groceries were pizza…
[Griffin and Clint chuckle]
Travis: “Can you give me all the ingredients but not cooked, please?”
Griffin: Alright, is there anybody else in your apartment building?
Justin: No, the other two—the other—the fourth apartment is unoccupied.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Currently. Y’know, that’s the problem with an area like this, somebody moves out, it’s not like we have an influx of people, y’know.
Griffin: Sure. Okay. Alright, so it’s somewhere close to the end of the two-month span, very close, I think, like, a week before the events of this arc, and you’re behind the apartment building, it’s 6:13, sure enough, nobody’s out there.
Justin: And Mr. Tarkesian is still working.
Griffin: Mr. Tarkesian’s still at work, Mrs. Pearson’s holed up for the evening…
Travis: Watchin’ Wheel.
Justin: She watches the news, 6:00-6:30 she’s watchin’ the news.
Griffin: ...Watchin’ the news, so you know you’re clear, and your watch rolls over to 6:14 and then, like, without a sound- there’s no “BSSSHH!”, like, there’s Minerva, and she’s standing in front of you, and she says:
Minerva: Duck Newton, let’s be swift, eh? Only a few moments, are you ready to begin your training?
Duck: Alright, here’s the first thing I wanted to show you, check this out.
Justin: And he jumps in the air and kicks. And he says:
Duck: ...Is that anything? ‘Cause I—
[Griffin and Clint laugh]
Duck: I did it and it felt- I did it and it felt like it was somethin’, but I don’t know if that’s anything.
Minerva: Well, why don’t you try to do—
Duck: It’s kind of like a half-kick…
Minerva: Yes.
Duck: I kinda jump up and do, like, a half-kick.
Minerva: It looked rad and might scare your opponent into maybe wavering for a moment, giving you an opportunity to strike them with your blade. But you’ve just taken up, like, one of our three minutes with it, so I think keep practicing and, um, let’s see how it goes.
Duck: Alright.
Griffin: Let’s- why don’t you roll to Kick Some Ass? I think that’d be a cool way to, like, see how well you do with this training session.
Justin: It is really ha- like, I have my dice in my hand, it’s very hard to break that habit, but I will use your digital- your rigged game.
Griffin: …Oh, you were saying?
Justin: Oh, I kicked- 11 points to kick this ghost’s ass. [chuckles] And, uh…
Griffin: Actually, you added your… what is it, Body? … Tough.
Justin: Yeah, add Tough, which he has 1, so that’s a 12!
Griffin: Alright, I think this is great because, like, after a few weeks of her- and I think the training is, like, you take turns, you swinging your blade at her, just trying to hit her while she kinda dodges outta the way, then she- she has a blade of her own, wherever she is, that you can sorta see in the projection that she swings at you, and she—
Justin: I feel like because of the magical nature of my blade, like, we could, like, fight that way. Like, I feel like I could have a real- even though she’s spectral, right, like—
Griffin: So here’s the thing: you are right, your blade is magic, but, like, you have hit her before, it just passes right through her. Because—
Justin: I meant the sword herself- like, I don’t think it hurts her, but I feel like her sword maybe could bounce off—
Griffin: Here’s how we rectify it: I think it’s- you feel something when it hits her, but it’s not, like, in your hand, right, it’s like your brain telling you, like, “that’s a hit”, but it’s not like the blade is stopped in the air. But, that has been sort of rare, for you to actually get a hit off on her. I think this time, you stab at her and she dodges out of the way, and you quickly swing the blade upwards, and you get a hit on her, and even though, like, again, she’s not tangible, I think she falls down. And this is, like, quick, this happens in the span of a second, and she’s laughing as she goes. And she says:
Minerva: Oh, Duck Newton, you have been practicing! I see you’re really giving in to the instincts!
Duck: Yeah, I’ve been feeling like I’ve been getting a little bit better, y’know, I’m trying to put in my time and polish up a little bit.
Griffin: She says:
Minerva: Your skills are impressive, Duck Newton, more impressive than I expected them to get, there is a certain amount of… let’s call it “help” that you receive just for being the Chosen One, but it seems like you’ve supplemented that yourself with doing a little… what did you call it, “CrossFit”?
Duck: Yeah, I’m still doing CrossFit, I went back and, uh… y’know, I’m not gettin’ there every week, but I feel like, because of… magic, that’s probably fine. And destiny, y’know?
Griffin: She says:
Minerva: No, you’re- again, the instinct that you received upon becoming the Chosen One will do you well, there’s no need to overexert yourself. Duck, we only have a few moments, how is it going with Beacon, are you two getting along?
Duck: [sighs] …It’s fine.
[Clint snorts]
Duck: It’s fine. You don’t—just so I’m clear—you don’t have any other, like, magical weapons stashed somewhere or anything, do ya? I mean, it’s goin’... fine, but, you don’t—like, I’m pretty locked-in, I assume.
Griffin: She laughs and says:
Minerva: Duck, there’s no way for me to get you another weapon, that’s the only one of its kind on—
Griffin: And then she’s gone. And I think that night, you’re in bed and probably feeling pretty good about yourself, you got some good hits off… why don’t you mark experience? That’s not typically how this works, but I think you did a great job training your bod and your skills, and so I think this would reflect that.
Justin: We have to assume— we could say that that’s probably an assumption of, like, since we had a lapse of time, there’s probably a lot of failures in that time period.
Griffin: [chuckling] Yes, exactly. [jokingly] Mark 84 experience.
Justin: So we’re not playing complete Calvinball, [Griffin: Yeah, sure.] we’re making up for lost fails.
Griffin: Also because y’all just didn’t get that much experience that first arc, I mean, you probably failed a lot and didn’t tell me, but…
Justin: Didn’t roll a lot.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: We’re gonna roll more, I feel like.
Griffin: Yeah, sure, definitely. I think that night, you’re in bed, and you are asleep, and- this has happened to you before, like, you feel it coming on even though you’re unconscious, and- what does it look like? What do your visions look like?
Justin: This is gonna sound like a weird touchstone, but, you ever see, like, rotoscoping? It’s where they animate [Griffin: Yeah, sure.] over real people. It’s like that, but, like, a little more monochromatic, a lot of hues of, like, sapphire and green [Griffin: I like that a lot.] and stuff like that. But that’s what they look like.
Griffin: I think you just see water. And I think you see—you don’t really see any shapes in the water, I think your vision is a little too primitive for that— but you see this water, and it’s dark, wherever this water is, and then you see your body- it’s kind of, like, superimposed in this scene, in that style, and you are face-up, and you are sort of- you look unconscious, and you are falling in this water.
Justin: Hmm.
Griffin: Ned!
Clint: Hm?!
Griffin: Ned, whatcha been up to? I think just to set it up, because of the events of the end of the first arc, and I’m not sure if it was clear, what happened there, but the video that Kirby posted was not your Wookie costume, you, like, wandering through the woods, it was the camera still rolling, recording actually Barclay, actually Bigfoot, actually fighting a big monster bobcat that was infected with the monster fluid that made it real big.
Clint: But because of Ned’s crummy camerawork, there’s still some doubt.
Griffin: Yeah, it is still one of the most convincing pieces of Bigfoot footage that exists out there, and that is why the Cryptonomica has been doing pretty well lately. You have not str—you paid back the missing payments for your lease or mortgage or whatever, and you’re doin’ alright. Not, like, rich rich rich, but, like, you are finally making enough to get by, which is- it’s probably been a long time since the Cryptonomica’s been like that. So, what’ve the last two months looked like for you?
Clint: They’ve been pretty good! …For Ned. He took all that extra money and bought some drones, and, uh…
[Griffin laughs]
Justin: [laughing] Sure!
Travis: [laughing] What?
Clint: Yeah, he bought [Justin: Yeah, why not!] some drones, and he’s been cookin’ up a Mothman scam with Kirby. [Griffin: Okay.] They had so much success with the Bigfoot video that he bought a couple of drones. And that’s kinda been percolatin’ on the back…
Griffin: Is the Mothman thing you’re doing—just to figure it out—like, you have some sort of paper cutout of a Moth man, that you attach to the drone and just fly it around the town, or…
Clint: Oh, it’s so much more elaborate than that, it’s using a series of lights and phosphorescence and [Griffin: Okay.] lasers, there’s some lasers involved. We haven’t really put that into effect, that’s been on the back burner—
[Griffin laughs quietly while Travis talks]
Travis: Just to clarify, Ned was super behind on his rent, about to lose the shop, and he gets all this money and he’s like “Cool, finally, drones!”
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: Bought drones, yeah. Well, paid off the rent [Travis: Oh, okay.], y’know… money means nothing to Ned, he has no concept of it.
Griffin: How’s it different now, doing the Cryptonomica stuff while you actually have, like, a pretty frequent stream of visitors? I think it’s mostly, like, hikers who are maybe, like, doing the trail or…
Clint: Lotta folks doin’ the trail, a lot of folks have been coming into town, it’s- actually, the success of the video has been kinda decent for the town in general. [Griffin: ‘Kay.] Y’know, because people have been staying at local hotels and eating in the Pizza Hut, so it’s been kind of a boon for Kepler, it’s still not up there with places like Canaan Valley and stuff like that, [Griffin: Sure.] but, you know, it’s helped out.
Griffin: Has there been any friction with you and the—specifically Barclay, I guess, at Amnesty Lodge, for the fact that you put them on blast, kind of?
Clint: Yeah. And not only that, but I don’t think they’re too happy about it, I think there’s some problems.
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m gonna say maybe Aubrey has done a little bit of damage control for Ned, to be like “he’s old, he didn’t know! He didn’t know, it was an accident!”
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t think it was, like, a huge blow-up. But I think Barclay was, like, what the fuck, dude, this is like specifically not what we’re going for here. So I wanna do a scene with you, Ned, and I want it to be, like, now; I would like your catch up scene to be kind of now, right as we’re getting into the start of the arc. But, what could we do?
Clint: Well, I have an idea. One of the projects that Kirby and I have been workin’ on is trying to get the local TV station—see, because we’re in the National Radio Quiet Zone, you know there’s no satellite TV, no cable [Griffin: Yeah.] But we do have a local TV station that basically is all you have in Kepler: WKWV. And they have agreed to let me do a late-night monster movie show, like the old Chiller Theatre. [Justin laughing] Right there at the Cryptonomica, we’re gonna shoot it right there. And Kirby’s gone out and gotten these cameras, and so we’re putting it on Saturday nights. We’re gonna call it Saturday Night Dead, up against Saturday Night Live. And we’re just gonna show scary monster movies, like Roger Corman and all those old great drive-in movies, every Saturday night. And we’re gettin’ ready for the first broadcast, we’re getting ready for the first one.
Griffin: Okay. Um, let’s do this at the Cryptonomica. It’s, like, the morning before your first broadcast and you’re talking with Kirby about what you’re gonna do that night.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: Can we—just to get a little bit more interplay, can we also say, like, ‘cause I think this would be an idea that Aubrey would be—the showmanship, and the thing—she’s not in the scene, but maybe she’s, like, in the background setting stuff up, you know, she’s also there?
Griffin: Um. Yeah, I mean, this is also—is it shot at the Cryptonomica, or is it shot at the TV station?
Clint: Yeah—no, no, shot at the Cryptonomica.
Griffin: All right. I think there’s probably some production people there settin’ up some stuff, settin’ up some lights. I think they’re sort of having to move around—there’s probably, like, four or five people there checking out the Cryptonomica, just checking out the exhibits. They wanna see the Bigfoot video—you have a display with the extended cut of the Bigfoot video going, which I think Barclay was kind of uncomfortable about, but it’s bringin’ in the big bucks—and you’re getting set up. And Kirby looks really nervous, he’s like:
Kirby: Ned, I know this thing’s happenin’ tonight, I don’t know, uh—I’m not much for, like, public speaking, or being in front of the camera, so, like—
Ned: Oh, no, no, no! Worry not, friend Kirby, because you’re not going to be on camera. [Kirby: Oh, thank God.] This is Ned’s time! This is all about me! [Aubrey: Ned!] I am the host—
Aubrey: Ned!
Ned: —well— [shouting] What?
Aubrey: Where do you want the candelabras?
Ned: The magic candelabras or the regular candelabras? [Griffin snorting]
Aubrey: The—I don’t know what you mean, they’re all regular candelabras!
Ned: Well, yeah, but I mean I thought we talked about the gag where you’re going to shoot fire out of your fingers—
Aubrey: O-kay, I’ll just put ‘em somewhere.
Kirby: Shoot fire out of her fingers? What are you talking about?
Ned: Uh, stage magician. She’s a stage magician.
Kirby: Oh, yeah, that’s right.
Ned: I thought it would add to the pizzazz of the show.
Kirby: Yeah, for sure.
Justin: What you just saw there was some really dope, like, ‘hey, Dad fucked up and now I’m gonna burn him’—that was Griffin—and then Griffin was like ‘here’s a burn’ and then Dad was like, ‘actually, twist, I got a answer ready for you’, and Griffin was like ‘aw shit, I’ve been reverse burned!’
Griffin: Yep. And the burner become the burnee. Kirby says, um:
Kirby: So, uh, what flick you got on the docket for tonight?
Ned: Ah, great one to start with. It’s called Beast with a Million Eyes. Roger Corman directed it, 1955, oh-ho! Starring the brilliant Paul Birch—and, of course, the second Darren from Bewitched, Dick Sargent. So it’s got an all-star cast. It’s about this family, and they’re on a date farm, and aliens show up. It’s really a piece of shit, people are gonna love it. People are absolutely gonna love it.
Kirby: Yeah, it sounds like. I think it’s a good idea, I think it’s gonna bring in business. But I gotta tell you, Ned, I’m a little bit worried, ‘cause we’ve been doing pretty well here for a bit, but the thing about Bigfoot? Folks get kinda tired of these sightings after a little bit. You gotta keep it fresh. So I don’t know if we need to move forward with Operation Mothman or somethin’, but—I’m tellin’ ya ‘cause I see this with the Lamplighter all the time when we get a big scoop on a cryptid in town, and people pay attention, but just for a little bit. So we need to do something if we’re gonna keep this momentum going.
Ned: Oh, listen, the Mothman plan- we’ll definitely do this, this is just publicity, friend Kirby. This is just getting our brand, getting our name out there. I figured whatever we do with the Mothman, we kind of start unveiling it on the show.
Kirby: [crosstalk] I like that.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Ned!
Ned: Ah, we have exclusive—yes, Aubrey dear?
Aubrey: Do you have more cobwebs?
Ned: Yes. Look over there behind the vat that has the giant floating brain in it? The fake brain?
Aubrey: Got it, thank you!
Griffin: I think in the middle of this sort of chaotic scene, the bell above the door rings and in walks a young man- you’ve lived here for awhile, you probably- it’s not a huge town, you recognize him as Calvin Owens, the captain of the local high school swim team, and he looks actually pretty shaken up? He sort of stops when he sees the lights being put up and the decorations being put up, but he kind of shakes his head and he walks towards you and he says:
Calvin: Hey, are you, um… you run this place, right? It’s, like, this monster museum?
Ned: Absolutely, welcome to the Cryptonomica! When you stepped through that door, you stepped through the arch of doom! Here there be monsters, my friend! And what’s your name?
Griffin: I think whenever you deliver this spiel to people, they usually look kind of delighted? He looks, like, scared. Do you know Calvin or not? I don’t know, like, how deep Ned’s roots in this town—
Clint: Not by name. I mean, he’s a pretty big jock around town.
Griffin: Yeah, sure. He says:
Calvin: My name’s Calvin, I been in town for awhile, I’ve never been in here, though, but I know that y’all… [sighs] know stuff about monsters? And, what do you call ‘em, cryptids? Here in town.
Ned: Cryptids, yes, yes.
Calvin: So, like, what do you- what do you do?
Ned: Uh, well, we investigate… there’re a lot of monsters- a lot of cryptids, we call them “bom-boms”, we have a lot of bom-boms [Aubrey: Ned!] running through the woods here in Kepler. Yes, Aubrey?
Aubrey: Is “bom-boms” catching on?
Ned: Only with me!
Aubrey: Okay!
Ned: I’m the only one, apparently!
Griffin: Calvin kinda puts his- he does the Adventure Zone NPC symbol where he, like, pinches the bridge of his nose, kinda closes his eyes, and he looks up at you and he says:
Calvin: Um… this is the only place I could think to come to, ‘cause… y’all know about monsters and stuff, and so, well, uh… I got a new one for ya.
{Commercial break 45:13-51:01}
Griffin: So the three of you have reconvened at Amnesty Lodge with Calvin in tow. The lobby here is fairly quiet, there’s just a few guests loitering about—not guests, but residents, I guess—loitering about, they’re all in their human disguise, sort of given their uncertainty about the outsider that has come in with you? And Calvin still seems pretty shaky as Barclay enters from the kitchen and hands the four of you each a cup of some strong-smelling cinnamon tea. And after taking a sip of his tea, Calvin says:
Calvin: So, uh… I don’t really know what y’alls’ story is, but… look, I’m not a big believer in all the monster stuff that some of the folks in this town are always talkin’ about—sorry, Ned—but I know what I saw last night.
Aubrey: What did you see...?
Calvin: ...I saw the pool that I’ve swum in every day— “swum”?
Aubrey: Swam. Have swam in.
Ned: Sssswimmed?
Aubrey: Have swam in.
Calvin: I mean, I’m the captain of the pool team, you’d think I would know the past tense—
Ned: Say “did laps”!
Calvin: The pool I did laps in last night, it came- it came alive? [stammers] I don’t know how to describe it, ‘cause it’s water and I’ve never seen water do that, but… I gotta know… was that real? Do monsters really exist here?
Griffin: And when he says that, I think Barclay, like, kind of locks eyes with… probably with Ned, ‘cause he knows that Ned is the biggest sort of loudmouth in this department, and is making a face at you like [through his teeth] “Don’t! Don’t do it!”
Aubrey: Y’know, um… Calvin, was it?
Calvin: Yeah.
Aubrey: No, listen, power of suggestion is very strong, but there’s no such things as monsters. You don’t have to worry about it.
Griffin: Why don’t you roll to Investigate A Mystery? That is +Sharp.
Travis: So that’s a 7.
Griffin: Okay! On a 7-9, Hold 1. You get to ask one of the following questions: What happened here?, What sort of creature is it?, What can it do?, What can hurt it?, Where did it go?, What was it going to do?, and What is being concealed here?.
Travis: Did he see where it went?
Griffin: Probably not. I think- so here’s how this is gonna work, because you’re just having a conversation and this is for, like, hard details, I think he’s gonna tell you, like, what he saw, but if you want actual- and remember, if this is maybe the first episode of Amnesty you’re listening to, the big thing for this game is gathering, like, hard intel on the monster that you are hunting, that you are going to have to use in battle because the odds are usually stacked pretty heavily in favor of the monsters; the only way to get an upper hand is to gather intel and act on it. So I think he’s gonna tell you what he saw [Travis: Okay.], but if you want something useful here, it’s gonna be the result of one of these questions.
Travis: So I’ll hold onto the question and ask it when I need it. Also, because I’m a Spellslinger, I have Forensic Divination, so when I successfully Investigate A Mystery, I also get to ask the question “What magic was done here?” as a free extra question, that might be better directed towards someone like Barclay?
Griffin: Hm… yeah, I mean, so the other thing about this is that the information can only come in the context of like, what you’re getting it from or who you’re asking. [Travis: Yeah.] And so like, Calvin’s not a fuckin’ wizard… um… or is he?
Travis: [Gasps]
Griffin: No, he’s not.
Justin: Twist.
Griffin: So I don't know how much, so, I, yeah, I think that’s a good impulse. He’ll sorta tell you what happened and then you can ask one of these questions for some hard intel, keeping in mind that like, he only knows what he saw. So, he says
Calvin: Alright, last night I snuck into the Kepler High pool, and I was doing some laps. We’ve got the big meet coming up pretty soon, I was trying to get—
Aubrey: Big meat. [chuckles]
[long pause]
Calvin: Alright. I was trying to get, you know… tore— ripped, all tore up, um, in my, you know, swimming muscles. And, uh… I don't know, it was late, it was real dark. And, I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty fuckin’ good swimmer, but I… something grabbed me, pulled me under. And I was under for… a while. I was struggling under there for a bit. And I managed to break free of whatever had me, and… you know, I had my eyes open down there. I didn't see nothin’ grabbing me, but I managed to get away. I swam, ran, got up— got up towards the window I snuck in through. I was just about to hop out when I looked behind me and— God, I swear to God, the water of the pool, started to lift up. Like, make a hill in the middle of the pool. And, uh, when I sorta locked eyes with it — it didn't have eyes — when I looked over at it, it started to move over towards me. And then I made my— made my flight. And [crosstalk] got out.
Ned: [crosstalk] The mound of water… you’re saying the mound of water rose up and actually moved.
Calvin: That’s what I saw.
Aubrey: And Calvin, just— what did it seem like it was going to do? I mean, it pulled you under the water, but it seemed like it was intent on… on hurting you. Yeah?
Griffin: Is this your question? “What was it going to do?”
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Um… he says, um…
Calvin: I— [nervous chuckle] I don't know, but it was moving towards me there at the end, and it tried to drown me. I think it was gonna try and… kill me. I— [stutters] I didn't, you know, talk to it.
Aubrey: Calvin, can you excuse me for just one second?
Calvin: Uh, yeah.
Travis: And I cross over to Barclay.
Aubrey: Hey, um… I don't know how this usually works, but does this sound like… anything you recognize? And kind of… I don't know, creature or… spell? Is that a thing?
Griffin: He, uh, he kinda walks you over to, like, away from the place, a little bit. I think he’s a little nervous about having this conversation anywhere near Calvin. And he says—
Justin: I'm gonna… we can wait till afterwards, but upon seeing this, like, I start talking to Calvin as well. I have some stuff I wanna say to Calvin. So—
Griffin: Okay. We’ll—
Justin: That is happening concurrently to alleviate any, uh, concern of Calvin overhearing— overhearing what they're talking about.
Griffin: Okay. Barclay says:
Barclay: I mean… some sort of, like, [sighs] unnatural thing tryin’ to kill somebody, it’s— it's definitely an abomination. Just, like… it’s, like, a couple days early, Aubrey. It shouldn't— it shouldn't be here yet. We— we still have a couple days before it was supposed to show up. They— [sighs] they've been acting a little more erratic and… unpredictable over the last year or so. They— they've abided by certain rules for decades but now they're starting to bend ‘em. But yeah, I'm pretty sure this is… that's our mark.
Duck: Calvin, uh, let me bend your ear for a second.
Calvin: Yeah.
Duck: You know me. You know, uh, we’ve known each other a long time. I went to school with uh… with your dad, actually. So, we— we— you know that we're not, sorta crime fighters or police officers or anything. I know the uniform can be a bit misleading, but what we do do, is, you know, you asked about us. We’re kind of… enthusiasts… uh, into this sorta… cryptozoological world. You know that weird stuff happens here in Kepler. And, uh— ‘Cause Ned’s got his sort of interests, and Audrey’s got hers, and I— I’m— I’m interested in like, creatures and stuff, and Audrey’s interested in magic, and Ned likes to keep track of like, the… how people make up monsters and stuff. They call ‘em cryptids, but—
Calvin: I’m not making this up. [nervous laugh] Oh, God.
Duck: Oh, no, I know, I know, I know, I know, no no no, I understand. What I'm tellin’ you is… we have… weird stuff happens in Kepler, right? Like, that won't come as a surprise to you. We all know it. And uh, but— but sometimes people who have ill intentions like to use that to try and cover up… whatever, you know, dark stuff they wanna get up to. So— ‘cause we know about… the sorta… cryptozoological stuff. We're interested in it. Sometimes we’ll just like to help out, poke around, poke a few holes, and make it a little bit easier for the real heroes, you know, to kinda do their— do their job. And, ‘cause usually you— you know, you start to see it unravel pretty quickly once we start pokin’ around. You know, somebody’s using a ShopVac, you know, to make stuff move or whatever. People got all kinds of tricks. [crosstalk] But, uh—
Griffin: [crosstalk] So I think— So I think what would be cool here is if we did a roll. There's Manipulate Someone, and I think we can do this— uh, once you've given them a reason, tell them what you want them to do and roll +Charm. I think what you're doing is trying to like, assuage his fears so he’s not gonna like poke— poke into, like, what you all are doing.
Justin: Yes. Exactly.
Griffin: And the— the reason you're giving them is that, you know, “it’s all good here, there’s no— there's no monsters [crosstalk] “we— we’re a team that sort of investigates…”
Justin: [crosstalk] I’m also trying to like, lay down a cover [Griffin: Yeah, for sure.] that he can— he can tell other people in case, you know… he needs to.
Griffin: Um… so I think roll +Charm, and I think the stakes here are Calvin’s sort of… continued interference into this thing.
Justin: Okay. Roll +Charm. [pause] Aha, 9+1, that's a 10.
Griffin: Ah okay, then they do it—
Justin: Consider yourself manipulated, Calvin.
Griffin: They do it for the reason you give them. Uh… I think he— I think he just looks relieved. And he's like
Calvin: Alright. Yeah. I was starting to think it was a little silly. I— I— [sighs] I dunno, maybe the jets kicked on too hard and there were… It would make me feel a lot better if y’all would go— go, you know, look— look around, but I don't know, you seem like you’re not full of shit on this, so I’ll— I guess I’ll drop it.
Griffin: And he looks— I think he looks, for the first time since, like, you all have been talking to him, he looks like he’s calmed down.
Duck: And— and listen, you don't need to go, don't— we’ll pass this all along to the— the— Zeke and the boys over at the… sheriff’s office. [Griffin: Fuckin’...] Just let us poke around into it—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Fucking character list is getting…
Duck: [crosstalk] And we’ll, uh, and we’ll just poke some holes in this whole… you know, water thing and find out what’s really goin’ on here. And, you know how those guys don't like to lift a finger, so we’ll kinda wrap it up in a nice little bow for ‘em… And drop it off at their office. My metaphor’s gotten away from me.
Calvin: Yeah, a little bit.
Duck: You know what I’m saying.
Clint: Mr. Keeper? Are any of the accumulated, uh, residents of Sylvane there have a medical background?
Griffin: Uh, no, I don't think so. I mean, there's werewolves, and vampires, and a ghost… um, and so they have magical backgrounds, but no medical ones.
Clint: Well I just wondered if it would behoove us to take a look at Calvin’s ankle where he was grabbed.
Justin: Hmm!
Griffin: Interesting… Um—
Clint: Well I mean it was the only physical contact that [crosstalk] he had.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, and obviously none of us are going to have the expertise to derive anything from it.
Clint: Bar— Barclay [pronounced “Bar-clee”] might. [confused] Bar-clee might?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Bar-clay. It’s not— it's not Charles Barkley. He shows up in Arc Four.
[Justin laughs]
Clint: Oh, I was thinking Barkley from the, uh, from Sesame Street.
Griffin: Why don't we, uh, why don't you roll to Investigate— like, you can just do it, right? And that way we all sorta get a hand on the— on the ball in this scene.
Clint: Okay. Um… eight plus what?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Sharp. Yeah.
Clint: [crosstalk] Sharp? Then that's a ten.
Griffin: That’s a— you have +2 Sharp. Wow.
Clint: Yep.
Griffin: Uh, okay, on a 10, Hold 2. You get to ask two questions. And I think we, sort of resolve this thing here with maybe… um… “What can it do?” Or…
Travis: “What happened here?”
Griffin: “What happened here?” Something like that.
Ned: Listen, Calvin, I know it sounds a little weird, but, uh… I am quite an aquatic… fan.
Travis: Like a swim— like a Swimfan, you might say.
Ned: I’m a swim fan— wait no.
Griffin: [laughing] I’m going to— I’m gonna murder you!
Ned: I have a Michael Phelps poster in the Cryptonomica in the back back back back back back back back room, but uh… could I maybe take a peek at, um, at your— your ankles? You know, a lot of power [crosstalk] derives from the kicking…
Travis: [crosstalk] Hey, Dad, I just wanna say, thank you for making this as creepy as you possibly could in like [Griffin: Yeah, sure.] thirty seconds. I really appreciate it.
Griffin: I think you've been— I think you've seen him sort of walk favoring one of his legs. Um, and… sort of put it together like that. And he says
Calvin: [hesitant] Um… yyyes?
Griffin: And he, uh, he rolls up his— his pant leg and props it up on the table. And you look at his ankle and there is like a mark there. It's not like a handprint or anything like that. Um… it's just kind of— it's just kind of… sort of a red, uh, area, I guess, is the only way to describe it, that wraps around his— his whole ankle. And I think what you sort of glean from that is like, he was not necessarily grabbed by a… by a hand, necessarily.
Ned: My second question… You said you opened your eyes and you looked when you were under the water. Now I realize… you probably didn't see much but did you see anything at all. I know, chlorine, I know, kills me too, but did you see anything in the water at all?
Griffin: Is this “What sort of creature is it?”
Clint: Okay… I guess it's “What happened here?” I wanna know what he saw… if he saw anything.
Griffin: Yeah, I think it's one of those two. This is your— this is the second question, so I guess it's six of one half dozen of the other. He says, uh
Calvin: I, uh… I didn't have my goggles on, unfortunately. I was taking a little breather when it grabbed me. But um… I don't know, Ned, it was pretty dark and it was underwater, I didn't have my goggles on and… I'll tell you what though… there was some moonlight comin’ in, the moon was real bright that night, and— and so like, that was sorta what I was swimming by. But when I was under there, I feel like I saw, like… a different light. Not moonlight, it was kinda… [sighs] I saw it for like, a half— a millisecond, but, so this ain't gospel, but it was like, yellow light, under there? [crosstalk] Um… I thought maybe they had changed—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Like… like bioluminescence? Phosphorescence?
Calvin: No… No, just like a, not like a… you know, I wasn't grabbed by an electric eel or anything like that. It was just— I thought somebody had changed the pool lights out, put in some different bulbs or something. But the bulbs— the lights were out. There was some sort of yellow light under there. I don't know. That's— thats what I saw.
Clint: Damn you Sinestro!
Travis: [crosstalk] That is such a dorky joke.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I don't know what you're—
Travis: [crosstalk] I love it!
Clint: [crosstalk] I know.
Griffin: And I think with that… uh, I think… Calvin, uh, says
Calvin: Uh, [sighs] so y’all are going to look into this… right? I'd feel a lot better just knowing that something— the meet’s coming up in four days. I don't want folks… you know, gettin’— gettin’ pulled under or killed by some sort of living pool or something while— while the competition’s taking place. So if y'all would look into it, it would really help me sleep a bit better tonight.
Ned: Yeah, absolutely. The Chicaners will be on the case!
Duck: Now, I'm still not sure about that one. Um… the Chicaners. Nah, it's just us three people, gonna go check it out.
Ned: We’re the Chicaners!
Duck: We don't even really have a team name, Calvin.
Ned: But Chicaners would be cool.
Duck: Well… [smiling] the Chicaners… or just three… [crosstalk] people.
Ned: [crosstalk] Get it on a jacket— get ‘em on a jacket.
Duck: Well, I already have—
Ned: The Three Chicaners! The Three Chicaners?
Duck: I already have a jacket, [Ned continuously trying to interrupt] and we may add other people or one of us might beef it, so we don't wanna hang our hat on the number of people and also we [crosstalk] are just three regular people, [muttering] with similar interests.
Ned: [crosstalk] Yeah, but for spring, you know, something lighter, like a windbreaker kinda thing.
Duck: I got— got that too.
Ned: [disappointed] Oh…
Duck: The forestry department issues that to me, so I'm kinda covered on the jacket front. Pretty much any thickness or lining. [Ned: Hoodies? Hoodies? Maybe hoodies?] I’m pretty well covered— hoodies I'm not a fan of. ‘Cause of that hat, you see.
Ned: Ah, right.
Duck: So maybe for right now we’re just gonna go with three [Ned: Three people.] people. Who are lookin’ into it, Calvin. Thanks so much. I’m assuming you’ve left.
[laughter]
Justin: The room at this point.
Griffin: Uh, real quick, you mentioned jackets and, uh, I think you all have received a Pine Guard patch—
Justin: [growling] You will not make the jackets canonical.
Griffin: No, I know, but the jackets. You all have a Pine Guard patch at this point that you, uh, you were supposed to sort of, uh, fasten to the inside of your jacket.
Clint: Does it have to be inside?
Griffin: Yes. It’s like a secret thing. You don't wanna go around saying “I'm- I’m part of a team of monster hunters.” I think maybe if you put it on the outside, the first time Barclay saw, you he was like, “What are you— no, inside. It goes inside. For secrets.”
Justin: Duck’s— Duck’s is in his wallet, ‘cause he doesn't know how to sew.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And I will say [Justin: But he’s—] Aubrey’s just like safety pinned hers in to the inside of her jacket— uh, her vest.
Griffin: Love it.
Clint: I’ve, uh, got mine in a, um— I'm gonna get a tattoo of it.
Travis: That’s—
[Justin snorts]
Griffin: Okay. Do you have it on your person also? In addition to your tattoo? And also you don't have it yet, but you're gonna get around to it?
Clint: Yeah, I've got it, but— he's been really busy [Griffin: Yeah, sure.] with the Cryptonomica.
Griffin: Um, okay. Yeah, I think Calvin… uh, after this great dialogue stands up and he says
Calvin: Alright, I gotta head out, actually. It's my brother’s birthday, and I’m— I actually snuck outta the house to come here as is, but maybe we can circle back [crosstalk] sometime before the—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Tell us about your brother.
Calvin: He’s a— he’s a doofus. But, um, maybe we can circle back before the swim meet and I can find out what y'all found out?
Clint: Tell me Calvin’s last name is Hobbes.
Griffin: Uh, it’s Owens.
Clint: Crap.
Justin: Owens…
Griffin: Named after listener Calvin Owens. Thank you for Tweeting about the show. He asked if you can circle back up before the meet.
[pause]
Aubrey: Yes.
Justin: Uh, it's a problem when we— any one of the three of us can answer [Griffin: Mhmm.] you just kinda— there's this weird like, “well, I know if I say it now…” It’s like this math you do where, like, with each second that passes the likelihood of someone else answering becomes higher. [Clint laughs] So you don't wanna like, step on anybody, so we just like, fall into a circle of— of not being able to answer.
Duck: Yes. We will. No problem.
Griffin: Uh, and Calvin… stands up and leaves the… leaves Amnesty Lodge. Um, and with that I think Barclay walks over to the seat he was sitting in and sits down and he says
Barclay: [sighs] Alright. I guess it's, uh… I guess it’s a workday. We, um… should probably start our investigation. If this thing showed up, we can assume the clocks starts then. We got… you know, we got— we got about a week before it's able to leave Kepler, so we need to find out what it is and take it down before it does. So… I gotta, I gotta stay here, ‘cause I—
Aubrey: Could you make us some lunches?
Barclay: Yeah, of course I can make you some lunches. That’s my— [Aubrey: Sick.] that's my jam. But, you know, Mama ain't back yet, so I gotta, you know, hold down the fort here. Are you three good to—? I know you— I don't know how well you been keepin’ up with your practice and stuff. Aubrey, I know you've been going out back and we've been shooting some fire at some shit, but y’all— y'all feel alright about tackling this one on your own?
Aubrey: Sure!
Ned: Go to a swimming pool? Yeah.
Duck: I just got one question. Um… one of my partners has a real heavy stick that he clobbers stuff with, I got a sword, and my other partner shoots fire out of her hands. How the hell do we fight water?
Barclay: Duck, I… I don’t know. That's the— that's the job. One of the— one of the tricky things about this gig is we don't get repeats. There's not a lot of, uh, sort of institutional knowledge that comes into play here. I've never seen a water monster come through. So you're gonna have to figure that out on your own. But I think a good place to start is maybe heading to the scene of the attack last night and seeing what you can find out there. Obviously be careful, you don't wanna fight until we know how to kill it. And for God’s sake, whatever you do, don't— don't get in the water. Um… but I think if you head to the pool and— and see what you can see, it might be a, sorta, good place to— good launch pad.
Duck: Alright.
Griffin: Um… and he— he stands up and I think he picks up the empty cups of tea and puts them on a tray, and he says
Barclay: And listen, I— I appreciate you not telling Calvin the truth of the matter and… you gotta keep this stuff secret, Ned. You gotta— it’s— it is so important, I mean to all of you, but I'm talking to Ned specifically here because he can't seem to, um, you know… shut up about it. It’s… humans have a long history of freakin’ the hell out when the find out about Sylvane. And that usually ends with them coming over and causing a ruckus. The night that you three found out… that was an anomaly. It is of the utmost importance that no one else gets clued in. Okay?
Ned: My friend… Discretion is my middle name.
Barclay: I thought your middle name was Fuckin’?
Ned: Ned Fuckin’ Discretion Chicane!
[laughter]
Ned: That’s me! Junior!
Griffin: And I think with that the door to Amnesty Lodge… uh, opens and shuts and a… uh, a man walks in, a tall, sort of handsome, very neatly dressed man walks in. He's wearing a suit. Um, and kind of eyes the place over and sort of nods at one of the guests with kind of a friendly demeanor. And he walks over to the four of you and he introduces himself. He says
Man: I’m looking for Ned Chicane. Proprietor of the Cryptonomica? I was told by his associate Kirby I could find him here.
Ned: Hm! What, uh, what do you need jolly old Ned for?
Griffin: Uh, he, I think he sees you, Ned, and just like, deduces “oh, that's Ned.”
Ned: Damn.
Man: Mr. Chicane, my name is Agent Stern, FBI. At your earliest convenience, sir, I would just love to see your Bigfoot video.

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone...
Calvin: This is the only place I could think to come to, ‘cause… y’all know about monsters and stuff and so, well, I got a new one for ya. Somethin’ grabbed me, pulled me under. Y’all I swear to God, the water of the pool started to lift up.
Barclay: A good place to start is maybe heading to the scene of the attack last night and seeing what you can find out there. Obviously be careful, you don’t wanna fight it until we know how to kill it. And for God’s sake, whatever you do, don’t— don’t get in the water.
Agent: I’m looking for Ned Chicane. Proprietor of the Cryptonomica? I was told by his associate Kirby I could find him here.
Ned: Hm! What, uh, what do you need jolly old Ned for?
Agent Stern: Mr. Chicane, my name is Agent Stern, FBI. At your earliest convenience, sir, I would just love to see your Bigfoot video.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
{1:36}
Griffin: We fucked up— well, I fucked up. I goofed—?
Travis: Listen, Griffin. When one of us fucks up, we all fuck up.
Clint: Ehh, I dunno about that.
Travis: Depending on how bad the fuck-up was.
Griffin: I did a goofy bad job, and maybe we should start by sort of acknowledging that.
Justin: ‘Kay.
Griffin: [joking] The game’s actually called Monster of the… Geek.
Travis: What?
Griffin: [joking] Yeah, I’ve been saying the name wrong this whole time, and—
Travis: I don’t think that’s it, Griffin.
Griffin: No, okay, so there was a thing we shoulda done after the first arc that we didn’t do, and really it’s not my fault for fuckin’ up because we, like, didn’t know that we were coming back to this at that point, and so anybody could’ve made this mistake, [sarcastic] so really I’m not in the wrong at all, if you think about it, but you all—
Justin: If you think about it.
Griffin: You all should have more experience than you should have— than you do have now. And before we get back into the action and the big climactic stuff that’s happening, maybe we could resolve that first. We should also maybe talk about the fact that Travis and I are recording in the same room [crosstalk] ‘cause he’s in Austin and I fuckin’ hate it.
Travis: [crosstalk] It’s weird. I don’t care for this at all.
Griffin: ‘Cause he sort of embodies— he does a thing with his back where he kinda arches it as he records, and he makes, like, a fantasy face, that’s the only way I could describe it.
[Justin laughs]
Travis: I’m a fantasy kitty!
Griffin: He does, like, that, he says “I’m a fantasy kitty” a lot. Okay, so—
[Travis meows]
Griffin: “At the end of each session, the Keeper will ask the following questions: Did we conclude the current mystery? Did we save someone from certain death, or worse? Did we learn something new and important about the world? Did we learn something new and important about one of the hunters?”
We’re supposed to do this after every time we play—
Travis: Yes, yes, yes, and yes!
Griffin: Yeah, we’re supposed to do this after every time we play so the answers won’t always be “yes,” but I think it would be, for the purpose of our podcast, a bit redundant if we did that after every time we played, so I think it makes more sense if we do it after every arc. So, did we conclude the current mystery?
Travis: Yes.
Clint: Yes.
Griffin: Did we save someone from certain death?
Travis: Yes.
Clint: Yeah.
Justin: Yes.
Clint: A bunch of people!
Griffin: Pete’s not dead, folks ask about Pete, we just didn’t get back to Pete, but Duck—
Travis: Pete was in the bushes?
Griffin: Yeah, Duck definitely saved Pete with his actions, so that’s a “yes.” Did we learn something new and important about the world?
Travis: Yes!
Clint: Oh, yeah!
Griffin: Unequivocally, yes. And did we learn something new and important about one of the hunters?
Travis: Yes.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: “If you get one or two ‘yes’ answers, each hunter marks 1 Experience, if you get three or four, each hunter marks 2.” So, everybody mark two experience, does that bring anybody up to five?
Travis: No. I think it brings me close.
Justin: Yeah, wait, it does. It does bring me to five.
Griffin: Awesome. So, when you hit five experience, you get an Improvement. And you get a list here you can pick from, and once you have leveled up five times, you can start picking up Advanced Improvements, which let you sort of take your character in even more directions. I think— so, just a general housekeeping announcement, I think we’re gonna start doing more of a, like, Lunar Interlude-style between-episode between-arcs to handle this stuff, because this is a really weird energy to start out this episode.
Justin: [chuckling] Indeed!
Griffin: Dad, did you level up, or are you at four now?
Clint: What if I’m right at five experience?
Griffin: Yeah, that means you’ve done it, you’ve leveled up. When you mark the fifth experience box in your playbook, you level up. You—
Clint: Yeah, but how could I level up and not Trav?
Griffin: You fucked up more than him, he rolls super good.
Clint: Oh, yeah! Well then yeah, I hit five, yeah.
Griffin: Then both of you—
Travis: Can we get rid of the mythos that I roll super good? I just only do things my character is good at.
Griffin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We’re doing roll20 now, so that’s gonna get rid of the mythos one way or the other.
Improvements, so, you get to choose from this list:
Get plus one to a rating, max plus three, so if you wanna increase one of your stats, you can do that. You can take another move from your playbook, whenever you made your character, you had to pick specific moves to choose from. You can take a move from another playbook, and that one’s kind of a discussion between you and me, trying to find something that’ll make sense, so that you don’t, like, make an OP, like, “I can do magic and, y’know, transform into a… big monster,” which is one of the— one of the archetypes. You can gain an ally or gain a team. This is, like, a mechanical thing where you get an ally or a team who will then sort of be in your service, and you pick a different, like, type for them, are they a subordinate that will follow your instructions? Are they a friend? Are they a bodyguard? Are they a confidant? And you just have them. You can gain a haven, which is actually something the archetype the Expert has, and that gives you sort of different abilities when you are back in your headquarters, and then you can upgrade your haven if you already have one.
You have different things— okay, so for Crooked, recover a big stash of money, so that’d be one for Ned, other… oh, Spell-Slinger, you can take another combat magic pick, so maybe you’ll wanna do that when you level up. So those are the things you can do. What’re you guys feeling like, Ned and Duck?
Clint: I really thought about “gain an ally,” but I think I’ve already got that in Kirby, and I think it might be a little redundant?
Griffin: So what we could do is just make that official. Because, like, before, Kirby was just an NPC in this world and if you wanted to convince him to do something, you had to convince him to do something. If you choose “gain an ally/gain a team” and you pick, like, what kind of ally you want him to be, then that’s mechanical at that point, you don’t have to, like, roll to convince him to do stuff, he will do stuff for you. So I don’t think it’s redundant, I think it is—
Travis: It codifies— [crosstalk] yeah, yeah, the mechanics…
Griffin: [crosstalk] It codifies what is already there.
Clint: That’s what I’d like to do. I would like to have somebody on this podcast do what I tell ‘em to do. So, yeah! Let’s go with him!
Griffin: So you get to pick: subordinate, lieutenant, friend, bodyguard, confidant, or backup. And those sort of add some flavor to, like, what Kirby’s actually gonna do for you. Also, keep in mind that, like, Kirby at this point doesn’t know about the Pine Guard, doesn’t know about the things you do, and so if you—
Travis: And we have been sworn to secrecy...!
Griffin: Yeah, so if you do this, that’s fine, but you’ll have to find some way to, like, rectify that, whether that’s letting Kirby in, that is one thing you could do, or, y’know, whatever.
Clint: No, I think subordinate.
Griffin: Okay, yeah [crosstalk] I think that probably—
Clint: I’m just gonna really lean into the me telling him what to do.
Griffin: Okay, and so— so mechanically now if you need Kirby to do something, instead of having to, like, convince him to do it, he’s just your— your guy.
Clint: [unholy accent] I’ve got mah claws in Kirby!
Griffin: Okay, [crosstalk] that’s very good.
Travis: [crosstalk] Ew, gross.
Griffin: Uh, Duck, what about you?
Justin: Uh, yeah, I’m picking up an additional point in tough. I know that’s not very dramatic, but I feel like it is representative of the sort of off-time that we’ve had that it makes— that makes sense to me.
Griffin: Okay, um, so that’ll bring you up to plus three tough, so that just means [crosstalk] you will—
Justin: [crosstalk] No sir, plus two tough.
Griffin: Oh, okay, that—
Travis: And you know, Justin, if you wanna make it more dramatic, people can picture like a Rocky-style montage where he’s, like, [Justin: Sure.] listing— lifting ice blocks and, like, punching stone or whatever— I’ve never seen Rocky but I assume he punches stone a lot?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: I— I know the idea of, like—
Clint: Meat, he punches meat, sides of beef.
Travis: Well, maybe he punches both, Dad, you can punch more than one thing!
Griffin: I know the idea of, like, the training montage is maybe a little bit rote for the purposes of our podcast, but what I really like about in the turn— in context of Duck is this idea of, like, Duck’s abilities were maybe not his own for a bit? He just had these supernatural reflexes and could take a hit and— and stuff? And the training in his last episode was him actually trying to take some of the responsibility of that on himself, and I think that this is a smart choice for, like, making that mechanical. Okay! That is how improvements work, we’re gonna start doing these in Lunar Interlude-style episodes, but for now let’s get back into the action.
Griffin: So at the end of the previous episode, Agent Stern from the FBI came into, uh, Amnesty Lodge and introduced himself, asking to see the Bigfoot video [crosstalk] from…
Travis: Daniel Stern and his partner, Agent Pesci.
Griffin: And I think with that the door to Amnesty Lodge… uh, opens and shuts and a… uh, a man walks in, a tall, sort of handsome, very neatly dressed man walks in. He's wearing a suit. Um, and kind of eyes the place over and sort of nods at one of the guests with kind of a friendly demeanor. And he walks over to the four of you and he introduces himself. He says
Man: I’m looking for Ned Chicane. Proprietor of the Cryptonomica? I was told by his associate Kirby I could find him here.
Ned: Hm! What, uh, what do you need jolly old Ned for?
Griffin: Uh, he, I think he sees you, Ned, and just like, deduces “oh, that's Ned.”
Ned: Damn.
Man: Mr. Chicane, my name is Agent Stern, FBI. At your earliest convenience, sir, I would just love to see your Bigfoot video.
Griffin: So that is where we find… you. That’s where us finds… us. Um. The last line there:
Agent Stern: My name is, uh, Agent Stern, FBI. At your earliest convenience Mr. Chicane, I would just love to see the Bigfoot video.
Ned: All you have to do is go to the Cryptonomicon with me and you can watch the video there.
Griffin: Is it “Cryptonomicon” or “Cryptonomica”?
Clint: [defeated] I don’t know.
[Justin and Travis laugh]
Clint: Cryptonomica!
Travis: [crosstalk] [sarcastically] What a great start!
Justin: [crosstalk] [sarcastically] Let’s look at what our merch says.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: We got merch?
Griffin: He says:
Agent Stern: Oh, no, I— I know, I stopped by. Your associate Kirby suggested that there might be more of the video than what you’re actually showing at the— on the floor in your establishment. Also I’d like to [Ned laughs] sort of talk to you about the details of how you acquired such a— a remarkable video.
Ned: Ah! Well, of course you would, uh, it’s pretty breathtaking, isn’t it.
Aubrey: Uh, one second, Ned. [to Agent Stern] Um, could you show us any kind of ID, or anything to back up this whole “I’m an agent” thing?
Ned: I have my driver’s license…
Aubrey: No, Ed— Ned—
Travis: What was it?
[Justin laughs]
Aubrey: Not you.
Ned: Oh! Sorry.
Griffin: Uh, Agent Stern looks kind of sheepish for a second and he’s like,
Agent Stern: Oh, God, of course, I— I’m sorry, what am I thinking.
Griffin: And he reaches into his jacket and—
Aubrey: Slow!
Griffin: What are you— “Slow?”
Travis: Aubrey has had minor, like, juvie run-ins with law enforcement in the past. She is distrusting.
Griffin: He, uh, he reaches into his breast pocket and he pulls out a badge and, like, one of those little nice leather badge holders, whatever they call them. Uh, and opens it up to reveal a authentic-looking ID badge that lists his name—
Travis: Should I roll to check for psychic paper?
Griffin: It’s… I guess if you want to? I—
Travis: Well, what would a roll be where I could, like, determine [crosstalk] if it’s—
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s not psychic paper. I’m not— I don’t want you to—
Travis: No, but if it seems legit or not. Maybe “Read A Bad Situation?” Uh yeah. I’m just gonna roll and we’ll see how it goes. Ah, super good! I rolled a 10.
Griffin: [laughing] Okay, it’s not psychic paper.
Travis: I know it’s not psychic paper, but does it seem legit?
Griffin: Yeah, it looks very legit. It— I mean, I don’t know if you’ve ever seen an FBI badge before, but it definitely— you know for sure that this, this guy is on the level. His badge says he works for the FBI, there’s the cool FBI seal there.
Travis: Aubrey has watched a lot of X-Files [Griffin: Yes.] so most of her FBI knowledge is from that.
Griffin: The badge actually says… the words underneath his sort of FBI designation, it says “Unexplained Phenomena.” He says,
Agent Stern: It’s, uh, it’s all right there. It’s actually expiring soon, my birthday’s coming up so I need to get this re-authorized, but, um, yeah. I— I am a federal agent. I’m actually— so, I work for a team called, a small task force called “UP” — Unexplained Phenomena. Myself, I have been researching, well, for some time now, several disappearances that have been attributed to— and this is gonna sound silly, and I understand you wanting to check my credentials because it probably sounds kind of, kind of goofy but they are attributed to… the Sasquatch?
Griffin: And when he says that, Barclay who is sort of standing in this scene with his— he’s collecting the cups of tea that you all were drinking on a tray, he like tips the tray over and they all smash down to the ground and he quickly cleans it up and leaves the room, and he says,
Agent Stern: The video that you, uh, put up online, Ned, it looks remarkably similar to other video sightings that I’ve been researching for some time, associated with these disappearances and so I know it’s kind of a long shot, but I’d just want to hear more about it. We don’t have to talk today, I— I know you seem to be in the middle of a conversation here so maybe we could circle back tomorrow, back at your shop or sometime later this week, whatever works for you?
Ned: Well, of course, Friend Stern!
Griffin: He smiles—
Travis: I do like how, over time, Ned’s character voice is kinda evolving into, like, Robin Hood, a little bit? [crosstalk] [imitating Robin Hood] “Yes, Prince—”!
Clint: [crosstalk] [imitating Robin Hood] Yoinks and away, Friend Stern!
Griffin: He smiles when you agree to that and puts his badge away and he takes a look around Amnesty Lodge, the lobby that you all are standing in, again, and he says,
Agent Stern: Say, um, I actually just arrived in Kepler, it’s a beautiful town, the pines are— are gorgeous this time of year. Um, I’m new to the area, I don’t—
Duck: They’re— they’re Evergreen, they’re gorgeous pretty much all year.
Agent Stern: Ah, I see. Well, I’m new in town and I don’t actually have a place to stay yet, this establishment seems very nice, I was wondering if there was [crosstalk] a room available—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Oh, no, you don’t— no, you don’t wanna stay here, [whispers loudly] bedbugs.
Agent Stern: You have…?
Aubrey: [pauses] I don’t— I don’t, I… Listen, if I could afford a better place than this, I would, this is a real fleabag, you don’t…
Griffin: Uh, this is gonna be a roll ‘cause this is a nice place that doesn’t have bedbugs. I think this is gonna be a [Travis: [laughing] Oh, nope.] manipulate someone? “When you have given them a reason, tell them what you want them to do and roll plus charm.” The reason is “bedbugs” and what you want them to do is not stay here.
Travis: I got a five plus one, it’s a six.
Griffin: Mark experience. Hey, you leveled up!
Travis: Yay, I leveled up!
Griffin: Maybe decide which improvement you want on your— on your own time and let me know what it is.
Travis: [muttering] I see, everyone else gets to talk about theirs.
Griffin: I mean, you can do it while we’re playing here. So, on a miss, I get to make a hard move. And the hard move, I say, is:
Agent Stern: Oh, a few bedbugs don’t scare me, I, uh, I actually— I’ve come prepared, I have my own sort of travel kit. I packed a lot of, y’know, tick and bug spray, I knew I was coming to a more rural area and I’m always sorta prepared, so. If, if there is a room available, I would, I would love to have it.
Griffin: And I think Barclay’s back and doesn’t really know what to say and he says,
Barclay: Yeah, uh, o-okay. We’ll getcha checked in and, uh, get you a nice room, I guess.
Griffin: And he smiles and, uh, says,
Agent Stern: I’m going to continue sort of my search around the general area, sort of familiarize myself with the town, but I will be back this evening and we can set up the room, thank you so much! Ned, tomorrow, just let me know what time works for you.
Ned: Um, yeah, right, got it, mm-hm.
Travis: Real quick, I have picked Third Eye [Griffin: Ooh, what’s that—] because Third Eye, “When you read a bad situation you can open your third eye for a moment to take in extra information. Take plus one Hold on any result of seven or more, plus you can see invisible things. [Griffin: Ohh...] On a miss, you still get one hold but you’re exposed to supernatural danger. Unfiltered reality is tough on the mind.”
Griffin: I love that. That’s very cool.
Travis: So, I feel like it fits in, like, of her learning about magic and getting in touch with her own, like kind of [Griffin: Yeah, I like that.] like, magic powers.
Griffin: That’s a— That’s a cool development. Okay, go ahead and mark that down. And everybody should be at zero experience at this point. Okay, and so Agent Stern turns on his heels and walks out the door, and Barclay puts his head in his hands and says:
Barclay: Oh shit. Oh shit, this is gonna make things real hard y’all.
Duck: Well, certainly people have come looking for you before, right? I have to assume, right?
Barclay: It’s not just me, this place is full of werewolves and vampires and… ghouls and stuff. It’s gonna be tough to keep that under wraps with the feds literally [Duck: Yeah...] under our noses.
Duck: It sounds like he’s pretty ‘squatch focused, wouldn’t ya say?
Griffin: He says
Barclay: Yeah, I guess as long as I keep this on.
Griffin: And he motions to the bracelet and says
Barclay: I guess I can keep it on until he takes off. It gets a little stinky inside the—
Aubrey: Listen, Barclay, here’s what you do. Um, we’ll take care of this. If he starts asking questions about, y’know, sightings or anything like that, just have everyone at the lodge laugh it off. Right, really play up the, like, “This is a tourist trap” thing and “We staged it, this is Kepler’s whole thing.” Y’know, make jokes about the Loch Ness Monster, that kind of thing. Really, like, make it seem as absurd as possible. Don’t let anyone answer seriously.
Barclay: Okay, yeah, that’s— that’s good advice. I’ll make sure to get the word out, and make sure that everybody keeps their [deep sigh] their illusions up. And again—
Aubrey: Side note. Loch Ness Monster, is that anything? Do you guys know anything about that?
Barclay: I mean, I’ve never seen ‘em. It doesn’t mean that they’re not [Aubrey: Okay, just—] here. And again, just one more time Ned, [sarcastic] thank you for posting that very cool video on the internet. Um, I sure do appreciate all the cool stuff that’s happened because of that, of me fighting the bobcat. It was really, like a, really, really, really cool thing to have happened.
Ned: Well I— I remember that— that was the time I saved your damn life, right? When I pulled up and knocked the monster off of you and [Barclay: Yes.] let you have a ride back to the lodge. Hmmm, remember that part of it, Barclay?
Barclay: …Okay, square-square. All right, we gotta moving. I don’t— I don’t know when this— this water monster showed up and I don’t know how long they’re gonna stick around. So, time’s of the essence, but, y’know, now were on double super-spy level of discretion, so head to the pool—
Aubrey: To the pool!
Barclay: ...Yeah, to the pool. Just, uh—
Aubrey: Oh, I thought that would be, like, where the scene ended.
Barclay: No, not quite yet.
Aubrey: [less excited] To the pool!
Barclay: Okay.
Griffin: [chuckling] And you go to the pool!
Travis: Maybe there’s some kind if transition here… [imitates sped-up transition music]
Griffin: Yeah, you take Ned’s car…
Travis: With, like, a spinning Pine Guard patch, y’know… [continues to imitate transition music]
Griffin: Maybe it’s the hubcap of the Continental.
Travis: Oh, yeah— well, it’s of a spinning Pine Guard patch, and then it fades into the wheel.
Griffin: Oh, that’s fucking great, Travis.
Travis: This is why we should always record in the same room.
Griffin: I know, this energy is electrifying!
Travis: I can feel it.
[Justin laughs]
Griffin: So the three of you arrive at Kepler High, and I think it’s— I forget if we established this in the first episode of this arc, but I think it’s, like, Saturday, so the whole front parking lot is as empty as you would expect it to be.
Travis: Except for a couple cars, for some kids that were in detention, and maybe they learned a little bit about each other, y’know?
Griffin: And themselves.
Travis: One kid’s kind of, like, a punk, and one kid’s kind of a nerd, and one kid’s kind of a jock…
Griffin: One of the cars has a bumper sticker on the back that said “I duct-taped a kid’s buttcheeks together.”
Travis: Uh-huh.
Griffin: That’s still the most buckwild thing, right?
Travis: And I think it’s superglue, actually. Is it superglue?
Griffin: I don’t know. Anyway…
Travis: He adhered a kid’s buttcheeks together, somehow.
Griffin: Yes, through some means, magical or otherwise. So this school, Kepler High, it’s a pretty humble building, its student body is around, like, 800— Duck, did you go here?
Justin: Yeah. Absolutely.
Griffin: Okay, so you have a little bit of familiarity with the building. Is it weird seeing the school in the same way that, like, it’s always weird to go back to a school you went to when you’re a big grown-up?
Justin: Yeah, I don’t think Duck has really had much reason to… come back here, y’know? It’s not like— patrolling this is part of his route, that really wouldn’t really make much sense, I don’t think he’s been back for a good long time.
Travis: Sure. What kind of social group did he fall into?
Griffin: Yeah, what were you— were you an Estevez? Were you a Hirsch? [Justin laughs] Were you a Ringwald?
Travis: Were you a Sheedy?
Justin: [contemplative] Oh God, what kind of high school kid was Duck?
Travis: Were you a greaser?
Griffin: A wastoid?
Clint: Were you a T-Bird? Maybe you were a T-Bird.
Travis: A real Bueller?
Justin: No, he was a… he was a… a bad boy.
Travis: Like a Bueller bad boy or a Hirsch bad boy?
Justin: No, like a— he was kind of a burnout.
Griffin: All right.
Justin: Yeah, that feels right to me.
Travis: You know, I think we keep saying Judd Hirsch, I think it’s Judd Nelson, isn’t it?
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Oh yeah, Judd Hirsch would be [crosstalk] a wild casting choice.
Travis: [crosstalk] I love Judd Hirsch in The Breakfast Club!
Griffin: Okay, so you were kind of a wastoid and then you discovered the beauty of the pines.
Justin: Well, no, he just wanted to— he hid in the pines. I mean, like, I think it feeds into, like— He wasn’t somebody with an abiding love of the world. He wasn’t somebody with a call to duty. He wasn’t somebody who thought he was headed for big things, I think he would just like—
Griffin: Smoke cigarettes in the woods?
Justin: Smoke cigarettes and fuckin’— not in the woods. He wouldn’t have gone in the woods. He’d just kind of want to play Tony Hawk and hang out.
Griffin: Cool, I dig it.
Travis: Now he just vapes 24/7.
Griffin: Now he just vapes constantly.
Travis: This is a— [crosstalk] which of our characters vape, we haven’t really covered that.
Justin: [crosstalk] This is not canonical.
Griffin: [crosstalk] {21:38} He’s got a magic vape that can talk to him also. It’s separate from Beacon.
Griffin: So as the three of you work your way behind the building to the sort of standalone pool building behind the school— Duck, you’re sort of reminiscing about all the good times here. But the three of you are a bit shaken as you turn the corner and you see the standalone pool facility, which has its own parking lot, attached to an access road that winds around the campus. And in that lot are two vehicles. There’s a fairly beaten up old Jeep, and then a silver midsized bus parked immediately adjacent to it. And there’s some belongings that are sort of scattered inside the bus you can see through the windows. And from within the double doors leading into the pool building you can hear a woman shouting. What do you do?
Travis: Aubrey takes off running. For the building.
Justin: Can I do that as I Read A Bad Situation?
Griffin: Yeah, I think that would be good.
[Justin rolls dice]
Justin: Oh, wait, [crosstalk] we’re all on the…
Griffin: [crosstalk] roll20, baby!
Justin: Plus one [Clint: Woo!] is 11.
Griffin: So, Duck, Hold 3 and you get to ask something from the list of questions here. If you act on the answers, you get +1 ongoing while the information is relevant. I’m trying to decide now if it makes more sense for you to do this, like, “the doors burst open and you can see inside,” ‘cause then you’ll be able to tell a lot more about this situation than you can—
Justin: I think that’d be a lot more logical, right? Like, [Griffin: Yeah.] the door opens and…
Griffin: Then let me describe what happens next, and then we will resolve the questions that you do here. And so the three of you burst into the pool, and it is not empty, as Calvin mentioned it probably would be. As you enter, you see a woman outside of the pool, she’s wearing, like, a pair of shorts over a swimsuit and she’s got a whistle around her neck, and she is sort of yelling orders toward the pool, where a dozen or so older folks are treading water with these small floats that they are holding onto. And the door to the pool slams shut behind you, and the sound booms through the chamber, and it brings these proceedings to an immediate halt and, in unison, the whole assembly, instructor and class alike, they turn to face you. Because while swim practice might not be scheduled for today, water aerobics for the Majestic Pines Senior Living Center is.
{24:15-30:30 ad break}
Griffin: This instructor turns to face you all, and I think all of the folks exercising in the pool also kind of rotate to face you all and the instructor says,
Instructor: Uh, pool’s closed, folks, we… we just got started here, we got it booked for a couple hours. Do you need something?
Griffin: And this might be a good time, Duck, for you to read the situation now that you’re inside, so you have 3 Hold if you wanna ask these questions.
Justin: Okay, how about this: what’s the biggest threat?
Griffin: So what you— I think the biggest threat is an assumption that you are making, and you know that this is the pool where Calvin was attacked last night, and you have no reason to believe that whatever was in here got away. And based on what she told you, they just got into the pool, so nothing has popped off yet, but the biggest threat is the fact that there are a dozen people sort of helplessly swimming in this water that came alive last night and tried to kill a young man.
Justin: Okay, what is the best way to protect the victims?
Griffin: The best way to protect everybody in this room is to get them out of the pool and, ideally, out of the building? So that they don’t, y’know, see a big water monster, assuming it rears its head. There’s a lot of things about this situation that could break very bad for them, and there’s a lot of ways it could also sort of break very bad for the secrecy of the Pine Guard’s mission.
Justin: Okay. Are there any dangers we haven’t noticed?
Griffin: Hmm. Duck, you are— I think you’re a bit startled as you come in and see that there are— “Oh shit, there’s people in here,” but you catch out of the corner of your eye, in the center of the pool, right above the drain where nobody’s really swimming and exercising— they’re all kind of against the wall where the instructor is standing— you see a single large bubble come up from the drain and hit the surface of the pool and pop.
Travis: Nothing goes [spooky underwater bubble noises]?
Griffin: It goes “[same noise Travis made] I’m a spooky bubble!” Uh, [Justin: Okay.] that is what you notice. So, if you act on the answers you get +1 ongoing while the information is relevant.
Clint: I have an idea.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Ned’s gonna go over and speak to the instructor.
Griffin: Okay, I mean, you’re all standing right— like, you are all sort of engaged in conversation with her.
Ned: How do you do, my name is Ned Chicane. You may have known me from, uh, my local establishment The Cryptonomica. And your name is…?
Hannah: Uh, my name is Hannah?
Ned: Hannah!
Griffin: Named after Hannah Cirson, on Twitter, thank you.
Ned: My mother’s name was Hannah Cirson, that is such a coincidence! Perhaps you didn’t know this, but, uh, I work with the local television station and I was watching my compatriots on “Good Morning Kepler!” and they had a public service announcement about your class here. And, since I am so closely tied with the chamber of commerce, I was thinking, “This is wonderful therapy! The exercise, the swimming, the muscle toning, and all that!” But, have you heard about the hot springs out in back of Amnesty Lodge? I would have to think that would be much more healthy, much more therapeutic and good for your fine swimmers here than just swimming around in a [chuckles] chlorinated pool?
Griffin: She looks at you and says:
Hannah: Y’know, I do remember hearing about the hot springs. I didn’t think they would be quite large enough for the sort of water aerobics [Ned: Oh!] that I do.
Ned: It is! Well, no, but think about it. It’s like those little pools that they show in the TV infomercials where you swim against the water.
Hannah: It has an infinity jet in it? It’s a hot spring, right?
Ned: It’s a hot spring and the water is flowing, and, y’know, that— I would have to think that would be much better for your constituents here rather than flopping around in the water. Having that water pushing against them and the warmth and the natural minerals, it’s very soothing I don’t know if you’ve been there, but for someone like me, in his mid to [hesitant] ...late 30s, it’s very relaxing.
Griffin: She laughs. She laughs and laughs and laughs. She laughs, she has a good good belly laugh.
Ned: But, having close relations with the lodge, I’m sure they would love to have you try out that facility. A matter of fact, we just came from there and it’s, uh, empty, it’s unoccupied, even as we speak.
Hannah: Uh, yeah, that sounds very promising. I’ll tell you what, after this session, I will head straight there and see what I can find out.
Travis: Aubrey would like to cast a spell.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: She would like to make a chill breeze to blow over as Ned is talking about how warm…
Griffin: Is this, like, a subtle thing, like “Oh, a hot spring sounds v—” it’s not like you’re trying to, like, knock these people over—
Travis: No, yeah, I’m just—
Griffin: You’re just subtly trying to influence the conversation with a cold wind.
Travis: Correct.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: That was a 12.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: [half-laughing, sarcastic] Jesus, get that pull right when you need it!
Travis: Yup.
Griffin: What does that mean?
Travis: I can… inflict harm?
Griffin: Yeah, I think that maybe this is Use Magic and not an attack.
Travis: So that’s what I’m saying, like, so I’m looking at it and I think it’s just kind of… inflict harm, but I’m trying to inflict very impermanent it is cold Harm?
Justin: So this— can I just… [laughing] I just wanna drill down for a sec! This is the moment in the episode and in this arc where Travis is making a combat roll against some elderly, wet senior citizens!
Travis: Yeah!
Justin: I just need to clarify that’s exactly what’s happening currently.
Travis: I rolled a 12! I have cracked this—
Justin: [laughing] Yeah, no, you’re gonna fucking demolish them, no question, Trav, you’re absolutely gonna wreck these old people’s shit!
Griffin: No, I think it’s not a combat roll. It’s Use Magic, and when you Use Magic instead of just, like, attacking them, you get to choose an effect, and one of them is “Do one thing that is beyond human limitations,” which is kind of a bucket thing. I think with a 12, because you’re not trying to hurt them, you don’t hurt them, right? A 12 is an unconditional success, you do what you were trying to do.
Travis: Trying to not hurt these folks.
Griffin: So I think, yeah, I think a couple of the windows were open over the bleachers, and I think from outside, a kind of chilly breeze comes in- is this weird, by the way? ‘Cause I sort of wanted to make more of a moment out of this, of Aubrey doing something that’s not just explicitly, like, fire fire fire. This is not a fire thing, this is…
Travis: She’s been training.
Griffin: Unless…
Travis & Clint: Unless…
Justin: Unless…
Griffin: It is kind of a heat thing?
Travis: I mean, yeah, ‘cause the other option is to draw the heat out of the water.
Griffin: Right.
Travis: It was one of those— those were the two things I was going back and forth of, like, chill breeze versus make the water colder. Doing Use Magic instead of combat, maybe she just kind of, like, pulls heat out of the water.
Griffin: Okay, yeah. The water starts to get ver— not very cold, but—
Travis: Colder.
Griffin: Unpleasantly cold?
Travis: And this is a thing I know from Teresa working at a pool, that like, people who are in the pool a lot and swim laps can like tell the difference when you drop it like a degree or two.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. Ok, I think as you are describing this hot spring, Ned, one of the swimmers says:
Swimmer: Yeah, um, that actually sounds real nice about now. This— this pool is uh, it’s getting kinda chilly and I’d like to heat up my bones, and I don’t see how we can’t do our lifts and stuff in a warmer clime, if they’ve got room for us.
Griffin: And, the rest of the people in the pool agree, and I think Hannah’s kinda like, pushing back against this, but she’s like:
Hannah: Okay, okay, fine. Everybody get your stuff, and I guess we’ll head up to Amnesty Lodge. It’s up Cliffside right?
Swimmer: Sure!
Ned: Duck, Duck, what would be the best way for them to get there?
Griffin: Duck, you see those bubbles, not it’s not just one, there’s a lot of bubbles starting to appear in the middle of the pool.
Duck: Uh, you know what? Why don’t I call in a transport. We got a lot of vans that we usually use to haul shrubbery and brush that we’ve collected, and I’ll have them send a van down here.
Hannah: Well we have— we have a van. It’s not—
Duck: Well that should’ve come up earlier, don’t you think, that you had a van on hand. Here I am, falling over myself offering y’all vans. What a goose. All right, well why don’t—
Swimmer: I thought your name was Duck.
Duck: Yeah, it’s a nickname. Listen, y’all got a van handy, why don’t you hop in and get on trucking. Don’t forget to— don’t worry ‘bout your clothes. We’ll drive them up seperate.
Swimmer: Why can’t we take our clothes?
Duck: [freezing up] You need to— you need— uh. Here, I’ll get them.
[Laughter]
Justin: [half-laughing] Duck runs to pick up their clothe—
Duck: Y’all start loading in the van and I’ll bring your clothes out to ya’s. Just another one of the many services we offer from the Forestry Service.
Swimmer: Is clothes— Oh! Okay, I’m going, I’m going, I’m going!
Duck: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Griffin: I think because of — I know this seems a bit silly, but all of you have rolled very well here — I think they all sort of start climbing out of the pool and, in this single file line, they hurry out the door as Duck is picking up their clothes off the bleachers and just throwing them out the open doors. And soon, uh, all of them—
Justin: [defensive] Nah, he takes them to the van! The van’s right there—
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: He throws them in the van.
Griffin: As he’s doing this transport, everybody’s outside, you and Ned see the bubbles getting faster and faster, and then they stop. And Duck, you finish taking all of their stuff out to the car and you hear the engines kick on and drive off. And the doors close behind you, and now you are all together and the water is motionless, just for a moment. [The Water, Revealed by Griffin McElroy starts playing]
And then a ripple extends from the center of the pool, and as it reaches the perimeter, the water around the edges of the pool starts to recede, as if called back by a tidal pull. The water collects at the center, forming a small mound, and then the water splashes upward from the center of the pool and the mound explodes. A primitive hand reaches upward several feet, grasping at nothing, before collapsing back into the pool. Three identical, cylindrical pillars of water lift from the surface and then recede just as quickly. Two waves form at either end of the pool and splash together, hanging there for just a moment, before dropping. The water takes several shapes quickly before settling on one. A tendril reaches upward from the center of the pool, writhing about and throwing water all around the room, before standing perfectly straight up 10 feet into the air.
Aubrey: Well, dunk.
Travis: Um, Read a Bad Situation, please.
Griffin: Okay, I think this is probably a more reasonable time for you to—
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: To do that.
Travis: Uh, I will—
Justin: I draw— I go ahead and draw Beacon, by the way.
Travis: Yeah, I rolled a nine plus one. Ten.
Griffin: Okay. Go ahead and ask your questions.
Travis: This is the thing, ‘cause a lot of these are very straightforward. Like what’s the biggest threat? Probably that big ol’ water tendril. I’m going to say what’s more vulnerable to me?
Griffin: I think with that I can tell you: Do not get in the water. You know what is vulnerable to you is like your breath. And you—
Travis: No, I mean, I think what that means is what’s vulnerable to me to attack.
Griffin: Oh. To attack. Yeah…. yeah, that’s tough, that’s tough for me to describe to you. I think that you logically know that like the water in the tendril is the thinnest, you can’t like shoot something into the pool, right?
Travis: Let me, lemme start with my magic eye!
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Which is actually Third Eye. Magic Eye is the posters.
Griffin: Yeah you blur your eyes and get it real close to the water and sort of the shapes starts to take… What does that look like to you? Describe what the Third Eye—
Travis: Well, I would say— envision it— so there is the thing in the Dresden Files were they talk about Wizard Sight, and I always imagined it kinda like if you switched over to the negative, you know like in a photo, except in the negative I could see the things...
Griffin: I like that. So like inverse color [Travis: Yes.] sort of thing. Okay, yeah that’s neat. You see... I think even with your Third Eye you see faintly, not in the tendril but actually in the water under the tendril several feet deep in the water, you see that yellow light that Calvin described yesterday and you are the only one that can see it. Ned and Duck, you just see the pool and you just see the tendril. But with your magic sight you see this shape in the water and then, if you are asking what is most vulnerable to you, it’s whatever that thing is.
Travis: Okay, so next question. What’s the best way out?
Griffin: Either the door or the, uh, the windows over the bleachers.
Aubrey: Okay, let’s—
Griffin: You have one more, I think, if you wanted to—
Aubrey: —start backing towards the doors.
Travis: Uh, what’s the best way to protect the victims? Which [Griffin: If—] I guess are us.
Griffin: The three of you. I mean the best way to protect the victims is to not get in the water and get as far away from this thing as is possible. But I mean you also know that, like, you’re gonna have to fight this thing eventually, and so whatever you can learn...
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: So, Aubrey, after sort of reading it, that tendril, which was sort of poking straight up before, it kind of bends and crooks towards the middle and sort of, almost like it looks in your direction like it is eyeing the three of you. Still in the middle of the pool, still like, a little bit of aways away from you, but it seems to have noticed you. Ned, what are you up to?
Clint: Uh, Ned climbs the high dive. Starts up the ladder, climbs up the high dive. I mean—
Travis: [crosstalk] Okay?
Griffin: [crosstalk] How about— I mean, I don’t—
Justin: [crosstalk] Gonna hit him with a— gonna hit him with a ‘phoon!
Clint: Ostensibly to get away from whatever’s going on, but I think he’s also going up there to get a higher perspective. That maybe looking down on it, visually, that’ll tell him more about the situation than being on eye level with it.
Griffin: Okay, I don’t think it’s like a super high dive, because that, to me, seems like weird pacing, like, “Oh no, let me climb this ladder for 30 seconds!” But I think it definitely puts you at eye level and you are on this high dive and it sounds like Investigate a Mystery, right? Which is less — I know it seems like that’s all you guys are doing right now, but that’s kind of—
Travis: We know nothing.
Griffin: Right, this is sort of a research gathering mission, and Investigate a Mystery is more about what the monster is and not what immediate danger you all are in.
Clint: So, I rolled a nine plus two for [crosstalk] Sharp.
Griffin: [crosstalk] These fucking rolls! You guys are killing it! Hopefully, when you actually fight this thing, you guys will fuck up a bunch. That’s my [crosstalk] dream.
Clint: [crosstalk] What sort of creature is it?
Griffin: Here’s what I— Here— This is one of those situations where, like, the answer is so obvious that I won’t charge you one of the hold two, because I think, you can’t see what Aubrey sees, what sort of creature it is is shapeshifting water, and it’s taking a different shape than the one that Calvin described yesterday, so you assume it’s got a few tricks up its sleeve. But what sort of creature it is is a big shapeshifting water monster, but I won’t charge you a hold for that because that’s sort of obvious.
Clint: Alright, then what can it do?
Griffin: Okay, I think the way that we resolve this is the tendril notices you climb the high dive and get on eye level with you, and the tendril starts to move in your direction. Like, not just the tip of the tendril, but the shape itself. The base of it moves across the surface of the water. So it seems to be able to move around to do whatever it wants to.}}
Travis: I’ve got it, you guys. Old people in a pool? Energy in the pool— This is a Cocoon situation!
Justin: Cocoon. We’ve got a Cocoon situation [crosstalk] on our hands.
Travis: [crosstalk] We have got a full-blown Cocoon.
Griffin: You have one more question, Ned.
Clint: Well if it’s zooming at me, I’m gonna wanna know what can hurt it?
Griffin: You get the impression, getting an eyeful of this tendril right now, you still don’t know what this monster is, right? But you know that if you can sever this tendril, if you can sever this water, this aquatic tentacle, it will go away. That doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve killed the beast or whatever, but you get the idea that, you know, the water is thinner here on the tendril than it is at the base of the pool, so if you sever it, it will resolve this situation. And with your questions asked, this thing is now moving towards you— now the tip of it is moving towards you at speed. Looking like it— it actually kind of goes around the side of you, almost like it wants to grab you. That is a soft move of me setting up future danger. What do you do?
Clint: Um, so it’s moving at me at speed? [chuckles] I wanna take Justin’s suggestion from earlier and do a ‘phoon!
[Clint laughs]
Justin: Oh no, the ‘phoon! The dreaded ‘phoon!
Clint: I wanna ‘phoon into the pool. I’m not gonna have time to get down the ladder, probably.
Justin: So many childhood summer days have been wrecked by the power of the ‘phoon. My worry has now pivoted, I am no longer concerned for my dad’s imaginary character. I am now concerned for this poor tendril getting ready to get his shop wrecked!
Griffin: Can you explain what a ‘phoon is [crosstalk] to our audience?
Clint: [crosstalk] A ‘phoon is—
Justin: The power of the ‘phoon.
Clint: A ‘phoon is a dive invented by my cousin Tom Neill that— imagine a jack-knife but you do the jackknife and you don’t unfold, so you get all the worst elements of a belly-flop, but even more because it impacts all of your body.
Justin: [crosstalk] So it is short for typhoon, correct?
Travis: [crosstalk] So it is both punishment for other people in the pool, but mostly a way that one might, I don’t know, give penance for something terrible they’ve done.
Justin: The least pleasing way of entering a body of water.
Clint: It is! And it might disrupt the surface tension a bit.
Griffin: Okay, I like this, so go ahead and Act Under Pressure, it sounds like. You roll plus Cool, ‘cause you are in a pressured situation. I like the instinct of, like, “Oh shit, I can’t get back down that ladder fast enough, this thing’s gonna get me. May as well charge right into it!” as you do a cool dive.
[Clint laughs triumphantly]
Griffin: You are kidding me!
Clint: Twelve plus one Cool!
Justin: ‘Phoon!
Clint: Thirteen!
Justin: The ‘phoooooon!
Clint: That’s not just a ‘phoon, that’s a [deep breath] ‘PHOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNN!!!
Travis: So this kills the creature?
Griffin: [sarcastic] Uh yeah, they die. Okay, here’s what happens. You realized you’re not gonna make it down that ladder and you turn and do a ‘phoon off the edge of the diving board. A full-spring, the diving board makes that satisfying, like, [diving board sound] [crosstalk] noise.
Clint: [crosstalk] [diving board sound, but better]
Griffin: Uh, and Aubrey and Duck, from the ground level, you see Ned’s imposing form launch off the end of the diving board, and, as you are going down, the path of your ‘phoon actually cuts through the tendril. And the force, the pure, like, inertia of your maneuver here, it cuts through the tendril, and severs it from the pool itself. And as it does, the water that was forming this tendril loses its shape and sort of just falls harmlessly down onto the floor. And Aubrey and Duck, you probably get splashed a little bit by this as the water falls and hits the water. Ned, you killed the tendril but you are now inside the water. You splash down into the pool and, as you do, uh, and you are now submerged a few feet under the water, your face is illuminated by this yellow light as you are now just right up against it. Now that you are, like, right up against it, you can see it, and that is what has happened. And then, I think you also, like, you were [crosstalk] prepared for the—
Clint: [crosstalk] Full disclosure, there’s gotta be some damage done. I’m tellin’ [Griffin: Uhh...] ya, a good ‘phoon hurts.
Griffin: I think it hurts, but you rolled a 12, so I’ll, like, I’m powerless to sort of do a bad thing to you here. You did something— the most rad ‘phoon anyone’s ever done. The bad thing [crosstalk] that has happened—
Travis: [crosstalk] As Aubrey and Duck stand at the side:
Aubrey: [awed] The perfect ‘phoon…
Duck: I’ve always heard tale of it, but I never thought—
Aubrey: He did it…
Duck: I’d see it with my own eyes.
Griffin: So something bad did happen.
Aubrey: This is exactly how he would want to die.
Griffin: Um—
[Justin laughs]
Ned: What!?
Griffin: Something bad did happen, though. I think because you, uh, you were so smooth in this maneuver you, like, got a nice, deep breath as you were heading down. So you are not sort of being actively damaged or whatever, but you feel that same tug that Calvin felt. Actually far more powerful. Ned [sic] and Aubrey, from above the pool, you see Ned being kind of yanked around the deep end of the pool. Like, by his feet. You see him just sort of zooming around the water as Ned, you are being pulled all around the water. You had a nice deep breath, so you are not being damaged by this, but this thing’s got a hold on you now. And is— you are its plaything now inside the pool. Duck, what do you do?
Justin: So… I… I’ll tell you what Duck does. Duck has his sword out and he… just stands there. He doesn’t have any idea what to do. He knows that he— his friend is in danger, he knows that there’s a monster in the thing… And he’s got nothing. For Duck, this is like… it’s 100 percent the situation that he kind of feared would happen. He doesn’t know how to do this. He doesn’t know what to do. And I don’t think he does… anything.
Griffin: [amused] That’s very good. Okay, Aubrey, you see Duck pull out his sword and then just kind of freeze up.
Aubrey: Duck!
Duck: [dazed] Y— yeah.
Aubrey: Grab the skimmer!
Duck: The… skimmer?
Aubrey: Pool skimmer!
Duck: All— all right. Yeah, yeah yeah, yes. Skimmer skimmer skimmer.
Justin: So he runs over to grab the skimmer and… is gonna try to, I guess… catch... him?
Travis: Okay, going one step further than what Aubrey did earlier. She’s gonna try to lower the pool temperature even more.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: So that the water gets sluggish and slower. [Griffin: Hm…] To kinda help Duck.
Griffin: I will say, totally? You have no idea if that works, right?
Travis: [crosstalk] No, no, listen.
Griffin: [crosstalk] You have no idea if that’s what this thing… Okay.
Travis: We don't know anything.
Aubrey: Here goes nothing.
Justin: Oh no…
Griffin: Oh, shit.
Justin: Oh no…
Travis: Oh no.
Justin: He rolled a five.
Travis: Is that plus Weird? So that’s a seven. It’s not a total miss.
Griffin: Yeah. That is a— a seven. So, I’m so glad this happened because Use Magic has one of the coolest effects on a mixed success. On a seven to nine, it works imperfectly. Choose your effect and a glitch. The Keeper will decide what effect the glitch has. So you get to choose whatever effect you were trying to do. Which I think was “Do one thing which is beyond human limitations.” [Travis: Uh-huh.] Which was soaking up the heat of the pool. And then you choose a glitch: the effect is weakened, the effect is of short duration, you take one harm ignore armor, the magic draws immediate unwelcome attention, or it has a problematic side effect.
Travis: Um… I’m going to say for this [laughs] because I think it’ll be the most interesting.
Griffin: Yes yes yes.
Travis: The magic draws immediate unwelcome attention?
Griffin: Yeah. So here’s what happens: the water gets cold. And Ned, you feel it now. And it’s— now it’s uncomfortably cold. It’s not like freezing, but it’s like, you know, probably around 50 degrees or so, which is very very cold for— for water. You don’t want to be in water that cold for that long. But as it cools down Ned you do feel this thing stop pulling you. And you— you are now sort of under the water. And I think that now you see the skimmer in the water that Duck has put down there for you. You’re probably pretty disoriented at this point because you’ve just been dragged around the water for a while. And so I think it’s probably pretty easy for you to grab onto that, if you want to.
However, the unwanted attention… the water— you see it start to pull away from the deep end of the pool where Ned was just at. And now it forms a huge wave on the more shallow end of the pool that was closer to where Aubrey is. And now it is— it comes down on you, and splashes over you and as it does, it just kind of actually… stays there. The water is now no longer contained in the pool, it’s not pulling you into the pool, it has come to you and it is all around you. And you are— you are submerged. And I think it caught you by surprise, so you are out of breath. Ned, what do you do? [pause] Uh, I think let’s resolve first, did you— did you get pulled up through this— with the skimmer? Are you back out of the water or are you still in the water?
Clint: Yeah, Duck— I grabbed the skimmer and Duck pulled me up.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: And I— I took a breath and now I’m back at it. I’m gonna help out.
Travis: Oh, good! [laughs]
Clint: Ned goes running towards Aubrey and takes his… Thudomatic walking stick and just sweeps it right through the stream of water to try and break the contact between the globe of water and the water in the pool. And that’s a seven, and there’s— he has no tough. So he’s kicking some water ass, sort of.
Griffin: Okay. On a seven, you and whatever you’re fighting inflict harm on each other. You charge towards it, and you bring up your— your cane in and upward sweeping strike. And you— you splash some of the sort of narrow connection of water between this frozen wave and the pool. And as you do, a tendril peels off the wave and just smashes you from above. It clubs right into you and hits you for one harm.
Clint: Mm!
Griffin: But I think you are sort of unfazed in that, and you continue sort of your strike against this— this connective tissue and you finally, with one more sweep, you do sever it. And as that happens, Aubrey, the water falls away from you. And you—
[Travis gasps]
Griffin: You fall to the ground and take a nice deep breath.
[Travis gasps more]
Griffin: Which probably sounds very good in the audio. Duck, you are up, and both of your compatriots at this moment are sort of free.
Justin: And what was— what did you see the effect of the— of the walking stick was?
Griffin: It separated— it basically killed the wave.
Justin: Cool.
Griffin: So the shapes that this water is making are Minions, which is another mechanic in this game. It’s not the— it’s not the boss itself, but it is things that are serving the boss. And that’s kind of how I am… making— making sense of how this monster operates. You see the water start to move around. I think there’s a few of the exercise floats that a few of the— the exercisers were using earlier. And you see them start to rotate clockwise, sort of around the center of the pool. But no shapes have formed right now. What do you do?
Duck: Listen, y’all, I— I think we need to get outta here, uh, posthaste. I— I know we haven’t learned much from this, but I’d say that we’ve learned that it’s… a living pool. And, uh… it can send as much ater out as it wants and not get tired and not get hurt. Um… and I think if we play that game long enough, we’re gonna end up… underground. So I’m kinda feeling like we should maybe get the hell outta here.
Griffin: I think as you say that, the water, uh, the water starts to pick up its sort of spiral. And now a full-blown whirlpool is forming in the center of the pool.
Aubrey: Yeah, you know what… [nervous chuckle]
Duck: Sounds— Yep.
Aubrey: Yep.
Duck: Yep yep yep yep.
Ned: Yep. Yep yep.
Griffin: So what do you all do?
Clint: Run away!
Justin: Yeah, we run. We’re gone.
Griffin: Okay. You all run towards the door. And right as you reach it, you hear a sickening kind of gurgling noise as that whirlpool, uh, closes up. And as it does, the pool stands completely still. And Aubrey, I think with your— with your Third Eye magic, still sort of, traces of it still functioning, you can tell that this light that was in the water is now just gone.
Aubrey: Huh… Well, I’ve got good news, and… uh, potentially bad news.
Duck: Well, why don’t you hit me with the good news first.
Aubrey: Y— okay. Um… good news is… I think we’re safe for the time being, ‘cause whatever was in that pool seems to be gone.
Duck: All right, mission accomplished.
Aubrey: Well…
Duck: Good work Pine Guard, huh?
Aubrey: Then we’ve got the bad news.
Ned: Which is?
Aubrey: The bad news is… I think maybe it went into, you know, all the water? Like in town? I think it’s not just confined to the pool.
Duck: Well… Fuck.

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Vincent: You gotta forget this night ever happened. You walk through that gate and never come back.
Duck: Right underneath, uh, preservation of forest, my number two skill is forgetting about weird shit. [Clint laughs] So you have come to the right department, here…
Dani: We can’t really live without some… sustaining… life? force? You know the springs? Behind Amnesty Lodge? Those have enough juice, I think, for a lot of us to keep going.
Griffin: Uh, you can tell that this light that was in the water is now… just gone.
Aubrey: Good news is, I think we’re safe for the time being, ’cause whatever was in that pool seems to be gone.
Duck: All right, mission accomplished.
Aubrey: Well…
Duck: Good work Pine Guard, huh?
Aubrey: Then we’ve got the bad news.

Duck: Well… Fuck.

{1:41}
Griffin: Y’all know Anthony Bourdain came to West Virginia? [Travis: Yeah.] For an episode of his show Anthony Bourdain Taste the World?
Clint: Yeah, where did he go?
Travis: Was he very— was he complimentary?
Griffin: He was. You know he did all the stuff that we love. Um… eating— he probably, like, ate a rattlesnake at one point and was like, “Mm, now this is real country,” and y’know, probably played ping pong at a church or something like that, but I’m trying to figure out how to, like, [making a list] is he gonna show up in the middle of a monster hunt, or is he gonna—
Travis: Ooh, okay.
Clint: That would be like—
Travis: Maybe he’s the monster!
Griffin: [continuing list] Maybe he’s the monster…
Clint: That would be, like, our third Bourdain reference in the whole series! That’d be very cool.
Travis: That would free us from the podcast, y’know.
Griffin: Yeah, okay. [Justin laughs] So, the three of you arrive back at Amnesty Lodge, and it’s nearing sunset, and as you enter the lobby, you realize it’s a bit emptier than usually? As you—
Aubrey: Huh, it’s a bit emptier than usual!
Griffin: Yeah, and then Aubrey says that. And then you see Barclay through the kitchen window, he’s doing some dishes. Dani is sitting in a recliner by the front window, and she’s reading a Lamplighter. And both of them seem slightly on edge, and it only takes a few moments to figure out why, as Agent Stern enters the lobby from the doors leading out to the hot springs behind the lodge. And he’s wearing slippers, and a robe, and it’s— [Clint laughs] He looks so refreshed, and just happy as a clam, and he says,
Agent Stern: Ned, Aubrey, Duck— I can’t thank you enough for helping me find this place! I didn’t really know what to expect during my stay here in Kepler, but these accommodations are fantastic! And I must have lucked out, too, because my room doesn’t appear to have any bedbugs at all.
Duck: Well, they can be, uh… small. [pause] They’re real small… around these parts.
Agent Stern: So you think they could— I guess I’ll do an extra sweep, thanks for the heads up. I didn’t know you grew bedbugs extra small here in Kepler.
Duck: It’s for your convenience.
[Clint laughs]
Agent Stern: I actually just got out of the hot springs, where I had the most lovely conversation with a man named Jake Coolice? He is a delight!
Aubrey: Yeah, he’s all right.
Duck: Coolice in the hot springs, huh? Love it. That’s a day, right there. Now that’s a day.
Agent Stern: Yeah, it’s quite a name… Ned, uh, I was hoping to come by in the morning to see the full Bigfoot video, would that work for you?
Ned: Ooh, I’m speaking to the Junior Chamber of Commerce at their breakfast meeting tomorrow… Maybe later in the day, perhaps?
[stifled laughter]
Agent Stern: Uh… I’ll find you, we’ll figure something out. You all have a—
Ned: [laughing nervously] Sure!
Agent Stern: You all have a great evening.
Griffin: He says, and he goes to retire to his room. And Barclay enters the lobby from the kitchen, and he’s drying his hands with a rag, and he says:
Barclay: Okay, so, how did the investigation go?
Aubrey: [nervous noise] Hold on!
Travis: And Aubrey, like, makes sure that the agent is gone.
Aubrey: Yeah?
Griffin: He’s gone.
Aubrey: Well, to answer that question, “Barkly”—
Barclay: Barclay? How are you— you’ve been here a couple of months, it’s weird that you—
Travis: No, that’s my nickname for Barkly. [crosstalk] Barclay, Barkly.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh, cute!
Travis: ’Cause he’s… Ahh, I got nothing.
Aubrey: Barclay… Not great, honestly. [stammers]
Ned: We won… right?
Aubrey: [high-pitched] Well…
Griffin: I think, in the effort of making this not a, like, extended in-fiction repeat of what happened in the last episode, I thought it would be a good time to talk about what you all actually learned about the monster during the— about the abomination during your encounter with it.
Travis: It’s Alex Mack, one.
Griffin: It’s not that.
Travis: It is Alex Mack! It’s a puddle—
Griffin: [crosstalk] I mean, it’s a shapeshifting…
Travis: [crosstalk] A living puddle?
Griffin: …Yes.
Travis: That’s Alex Mack, dude.
Justin: It has the ability to just like, self-replicate, I guess you could say? Or like, change its mass. But it does seem to be vulnerable to weapon attacks, right? Like we did seem to damage it with— by attacking it, right?
Travis: This is the thing that I’m trying to figure out: is the creature the water, or is the creature using the water?
{5:49}
Griffin: There was the light in the water, that Aubrey, you could see, and Ned could see when he got very, very close to it. When viewed from outside, the light in the water is invisible, and seemed to only be controlling the water that it was connected to.
Travis: So to Justin’s question, are we hurting it with weapons attacks, or are we just separating it from the water it’s controlling with weapon attacks?
Griffin: I think you lay all that out to Barclay, and he, especially when you mention the light, he kind of perks up, and he says:
Barclay: Okay, actually, I know what I said, but that kind of rings a bell. Let’s retire to the privacy of Mama’s office, I think I might have something.
Griffin: And he walks you into Mama’s office. And her office has changed in her absence. It’s much, much neater and more orderly than the last time you were in here. The maps and books that were once scattered all around the table and her desk have been organized into neat piles, there’s no dishes laying all about. You get the distinct impression that Barclay has been wanting to clean this room for a very long time, and finally got the opportunity to do so. And he walks over to a chest in front of Mama’s desk and reaches in, and he withdraws an old Macintosh PowerBook. And he kind of sighs as he pulls it out, and tries to get it to boot up.
Aubrey: What’s that, Barclay?
Griffin: He says, as he’s like, waiting for this thing to turn on, he says,
Barclay: Okay, so—
Aubrey: Now, let me be clear, this isn’t one of those like, “Kids React” videos, like I know that’s a computer. [laughs] I assure—
Clint: [exaggerated] What’s a computer?
Aubrey: Alright.
Justin: [imitating this GI Joe parody] What’s a compoo-tuh?
Griffin: He says,
Barclay: All right, so The Pine Guard was established after the abominations first started appearing in Kepler back in 1988, and some concerned citizens around town found out about the monsters, and about Sylvain, and they took it upon themselves to start fighting back in secret. And their ranks have fluctuated since those days. Folks… y’know, died, fighting the abominations, some packed up and left town.
Mama’s been with ’em from the start, but she was trying to fight ‘em alone for such a long time before she found me, a few years ago. This computer used to belong to a dude named Thacker. He was with The Pine Guard from the start, too. He kept notes on everything they ever fought, in this… [frustrated] the oldest functioning computer on this fucking planet.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: And he like, kind of slaps his palm against it, waiting for it to start. And he says,
Barclay: About six years ago, Thacker took off in the middle of the night without a word to anyone.
Griffin: And he kind of sighs, and he looks around the office, and he says:
Barclay: There’s a lot of that going around these days.
Griffin: And then the computer plays its startup noise, and a few moments later, Barclay says,
Barclay: Okay, okay. Back in ’97, The Pine Guard went toe-to-toe with… well, they called it an Elemental. It lived in fire and smoke— it could control it, it could move through it, and it took them… Holy shit, it took ‘em burning a whole mine out just to take it down. It kind of sounds like what we’re dealing with today, right?
Ned: Except it’s water, and not fire.
Barclay: Sure, but the concept of, you know, light inside of elements controlling it and using it as form, and as a weapon… it sounds like kind of what we’re dealing with.
Ned: Was there any mention of a bright yellow bug light involved?
Griffin: He taps around, and he says,
Barclay: Yeah… obviously it’s hard to see that in the fire, but they could see the light in smoke moving around.
Duck: And it only controlled fire, is that correct?
Barclay: Uh, yeah, that’s what it says.
Aubrey: It didn’t move to like, “earth,” or “heart?”
Barclay: [laughing] No, it didn’t move to “heart.” That would be a wild monster, though, somebody who could get inside of love.
Aubrey: I just want to make sure we don’t have to fight— I don’t want to fight Captain Planet. And I just want to make sure…
Duck: If we ever fight a monster that could control the power of heart, we’re all fucked, because that is the most powerful element imaginable.
Aubrey: Obviously. That was the only one that had an animal friend. Wait, did water—
Duck: I mean, I’ll fucking stab love, I don’t care, I’ll try, I’m just saying I don’t think it’s going to be that effective.
Aubrey: Yeah, that’s fair.
Griffin: Barclay puts on some glasses— actually, some reading glasses that were already on Mama’s desk, and he says:
Barclay: So it says here that magic and magically imbued weapons could hurt it, but not kill it. To kill something intangible, you need… an intangible weapon? It doesn’t say what they ended up using, though.
Aubrey: Well, hold on. So if it moves through the element, could we starve it? If we could separate it from a source of water, and then chop away… we could severely weaken it, and at the very least, maybe shrink it to a manageable mass?
Duck: I mean, it’s a really nice thought, but you’re dealing with— I mean, you’ve still got a question of humidity in the air, I don’t think that we would be able to remove water— moisture from the air, at its sort of molecular level. Right? There’s no reason to think it would need a full body of water if it could work with the humidity in the air.
Aubrey: Hmm.
Griffin: Barclay says,
Barclay: It’s an idea, though!
Griffin: And he opens up a new, like, document on this very, very old computer, which probably takes like, 45 seconds just to do, and he starts taking notes on the water elemental, and says:
Barclay: We could maybe use that for the hunt.
Griffin: And then he clicks back to the fire elemental, and he says,
Barclay: Says here that it was a pretty tough target to take down. Not only did it possess incredible strength in the right environment, it also… “marked and pursued those it viewed as a threat to its existence.”
Ned: Yeah…
Aubrey: Shit!
Barclay: Yeah. It says here… man, they lost someone on this hunt, a guy named Mike. It followed him into his car, got in the fuel line.
Aubrey: Not Mike!
Ned: Aw, I love his hard lemonade!
[Justin laughs]
Barclay: [crosstalk] I don’t know if he was the lemonade—
Aubrey: [crosstalk] I enjoyed his run on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
Barclay: [sighs] Anyone else have any famous Mikes that they wanna…? Duck, you got one?
Duck: I mean, they did two, I figure…
Barclay: Yeah, we’re probably okay.
Aubrey: Yeah, who needs a third to be funny!
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: If y’all went toe-to-toe with this thing in the water, you’ve… we should probably keep in mind the possibility you’ve been marked too. You might want to stay out of bodies of water ’til we wrap this one up.
Aubrey: Should we send someone to check on swimmer dude?
Ned: Yeah, what did he do that “harmed” the water?
Barclay: I think it sounds like he was just there when this thing showed up.
Ned: Or, he peed in it.
Barclay: Another possibility.
Griffin: There’s a flash that sways back and forth across the ceiling, a reflection of light against water from outside the window immediately behind Barclay. And he says:
Barclay: Okay, so no baths obviously, not in the hot springs or your tub, or whatever, if you had any plans on wading in the—
Duck: Wait, what the hell was that?
Barclay: What was what?
Duck: Just now, right behind you.
Griffin: That light on the ceiling now, it’s swaying even faster now, like a bright light reflecting against the surface of water, shining in from the outside.
Duck: Hold on, just— hold on a second, Barclay, we gotta figure this out.
Aubrey: [nervously] You might want to step, like, over here, Barclay maybe, away from the window a little bit?
[The Water, Arrival fades in] {13:15}
Griffin: He stands up and faces the window, and through it, you can see down to the tall wooden fence surrounding the hot springs behind the lodge. And while normally this angle wouldn’t allow you to see the waters, you can see them quite clearly now: they are floating in a perfect 8-foot-wide sphere, hovering above the fence’s perimeter. And trapped inside, thrashing ineffectively… is Jake Coolice.
Aubrey: No!
Justin: Uh, when I said “We gotta figure this out,” that was me leading into attempting to Read A Bad Situation, [crosstalk] so I would like to do that now.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay! Yeah, please.
Justin: And I got a seven, plus one… Eight.
Griffin: Okay. You…
Justin: Let’s see… that gives me one question. Um… “What’s the best way to protect the victims?”
Griffin: You need to get Jake Coolice out of this floating sphere of water. You can tell that the fact that he’s thrashing and stuff means that he’s not like, unconscious or dead, but you do not know how long he has been in that water, and you assume that he will be one of those two things if you do not get the fuck down there and get him out.
Travis: Let’s do that.
Griffin: One thing that we need to keep in mind with Read A Bad Situation is while acting on the answers, you get plus one ongoing while the information is relevant. So if you do anything to get Jake Coolice out of the water, Duck, now you have a plus one to do so.
Justin: Okay. Just so I— I’m trying to clarify the situation for myself. It’s outside, right?
Griffin: Yeah, yeah.
Justin: Out like, above the Jacuzzi, and we’re inside, right?
Griffin: [amused] It is not a Jacuzzi, it is like, a hot spring. [Clint laughs] This is not like, a Motel 6.
Justin: It’s God’s Jacuzzi, Griffin.
Griffin: It’s God’s, it’s the Mountain’s Jacuzzi, yes.
Justin: Uh, I’m going to run outside.
Griffin: Okay. Aubrey and Ned?
Clint: Oh, yeah.
Justin: Is Jake Coolice, um…
Clint: Important?
Justin: From Sylvain?
Clint: Oh.
Justin: Sorry! [laughing] Is he essential personnel? No—
Travis: ’Cause we were kind of getting into a groove, just discussing what was going on, and I’d hate to lose that.
Griffin: Yes, Jake Coolice is from Sylvain. The three of you, and Barclay, go running out of the office towards the door that leads out to the hot springs behind the building. I think Agent Stern actually like, pokes his head out his bedroom door as he sees you all running, and he’s like,
Agent Stern: Is everything okay…?
Ned: Coyotes! Coyotes.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Yo!
Duck: [crosstalk] Yeah, coyote. Got coyotes. Let’s stay in your room, stay in your room, partner, we got a coyote situation.
Ned: [crosstalk] Yes, please stay in your room.
Aubrey: But it’s a protected— it’s a protected coyote that we have to just kind of herd.
Griffin: Barclay’s just like, gone, while you all are… he does not want his precious boy Jake Coolice to die.
Aubrey: Okay, sleep good, bye!
Justin: I’m saying this is as we’re, like, running past him, like—
Clint: Yeah, like. [imitates voice trailing off into distance] “Coyotes…!”
Duck: It’s a forestry situation, I’ll take care of it, don’t worry, everything’s fine, partner. Just stay in your room, because they can get a little vicious.
Griffin: He nods and shuts the door, and the three of you follow Barclay down into the— through the door that sort of branches off the lobby down to the hot springs. You pass by a dressing room as you run down a set of wooden stairs and exit out into the hot springs. It has sort of a stone perimeter around the actual— well, where the water used to be, with like, a wooden base actually inside of the pool. And it’s surrounded by this tall fence, which is kind of lined with stacks of towels, and some buckets, and you are now face-to-face with the water sphere that Jake Coolice is trapped inside.
Clint: I need to investigate— I want to know something really important that maybe we can see by just observing, but is the water— is the sphere of water just free-floating, or is it connected?
Griffin: It is free-floating, off the ground.
Clint: It hasn’t done that before! It had— I mean, before, at the pool, it was connected to the water, whatever shapes it made— this is not connected in any way.
Justin: Yeah, do we see the sphere of light in the sphere?
Griffin: I think, yeah— I think this— that’s a good point, I think this water is disconnected enough, and not, y’know, deep enough, that you do see this light, and it is almost like, swirling around Jake Coolice’s form in the water.
Aubrey: Barclay, what— what is Jake?
Barclay: [panicked] Does— Does it matter?
Griffin: He’s like, looking around.
Aubrey: It might!
Griffin: He picks up a bucket and like, throws it at the water, and it just like, gets sucked up into the form, and he like shrugs, like, “I don’t know, I threw a bucket, what do you do?”
Aubrey: Here’s the thing: I could maybe try to like, blast him out of the water? But I’m not going to be able to do that without hurting him, I don’t think.
Griffin: Jake is now clutching at his throat.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Ah shit!
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay, that’s it! I’m going to— I pull out Beacon.
Beacon: [drawls] Yes, Duck Newton. This is… well, I don’t really know what we’re supposed to do with this one, eh, Duck? It’s a… quite a challenge.
Duck: Okay, Beacon. All right. Thank you for your input, that’s great.
Justin: And I extend him from his coiled position, and I tell Beacon:
Duck: Hey, hold on tight, partner.
Justin: [laughs] And I chuck him at the yellow light.
Griffin: Uh… Okay. I think this is going to be a Kick Some Ass roll.
Justin: My main goal is to protect someone. I’m trying to distract, basically. I don’t intend on like, trying to damage the thing.
Griffin: Hm, okay.
Justin: But I’m trying to protect Jake Coolice with this move. So like, even if it’s not a direct hit or whatever, I’m trying to draw the heat, basically.
Griffin: Okay, how about this, then it would be a Protect Someone roll, right?
Justin: [crosstalk] Right, that’s what I was thinking.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Since you are not intending to actually hurt it. So go ahead and roll plus Tough.
Justin: Okay, that is seven, plus… two. So nine on that.
Griffin: Okay—
Justin: Plus one, because I am acting…
Griffin: Acting Under Pressure! Good.
Justin: Acting Under Pressure, yes.
Griffin: Okay, so. You protect them okay—
Justin: No, not Acting Under Pressure, acting on my Read A Bad Situation roll.
Griffin: Right, right, right. So, on your Protect Someone, on a 10-plus, you protect them okay, but you suffer some or all of the harm you were going to get. So on a 10-plus, you get to choose an extra effect: you either suffer a little harm, minus one harm; all impending danger is now focused on you; you inflict harm on the enemy; or you hold the enemy back.
Justin: On your read of it, would “you hold the enemy back” pull him off of Jake, like in this particular situation?
Griffin: Yeah, I think— I think here’s how we could— ’cause I don’t know how to do it like, you free him by just like, hitting him with a sword and you knock Jake Coolice out of the water as you launch a sword in his direction. Here’s what I think happens: I think the water fluctuates as this magically-imbued sword, like, jabs into it, and you get this thing pretty close to the yellow light, close enough that you don’t actually hit Jake Coolice with your very good roll. And I think, as a result, Jake Coolice kind of like, unnaturally just like, falls out of the water, and lands on the wooden floor of the hot spring. And the water, like, shifts in the air, and it moves around you and then closes and sucks you into the center of it now, and now you are floating inside of this 8-foot sphere. [crosstalk] And Jake Coolice—
Travis: [crosstalk] So Duck is extra tough, right?
Griffin: Uh, so he has armor, and what you have to keep in mind about armor in this game is it works in fiction like everything else. So like, if he gets pounded by a big bear, his armor is going to help him out there. If he starts drowning, or is crushed by, y’know, a supernatural weight of water, or is burned by a magic fire spell, or something like that…
Travis: Uh-huh, uh-huh. [laughs] Go on.
Griffin: Armor won’t help him.
Travis: Ohh.
Clint: Okay, Ned, while Duck was doing that, Ned has been knotting towels together, and he has tied one end of it to one of the deck chairs sitting around the hot spring area.
Griffin: [laughs] Okay.
Clint: I’m going to take one of these chairs with the towels tied to it, and throw the chair as hard as I can towards Duck.
Griffin: Uh, yeah, I don’t even think you need to roll for that, and I think because you saw Barclay throw a bucket into the water, and saw it just got absorbed, that you know that that is exactly what happens here. And that is what happens; the deck chair goes into the water, and gets sucked into its form, and is now floating next to Duck. Now, if you want to try to use this to retrieve Duck from the water, I think you’ll have to roll Act Under Pressure or something like that.
Clint: Yep, that’s what I’m going to do.
Griffin: Okay, why don’t you go ahead and roll Act Under Pressure, then.
Clint: Uh, seven plus one, for cool, so that’s an eight.
Griffin: Okay, as you do this, the deck chair goes into the water and you see Duck kind of recognize what you’re doing. As you are trying to achieve this, and you are, you know, gripping on tight to the towels, you see a few almost like, wire-like tendrils, these like, gnarly-looking tendrils, like six of them, reach out of the water in your direction, and if you, y’know, hold put and try to pull Duck out of the water, these things are going to whip at you. Do you move, and compromise your rescue mission, or do you take the hit?
Clint: Ooh. Uh, well that… That changes things. Um… [Griffin laughs] Yeah, I’m not sure Ned is as dedicated to, uh… to old Duck as he is to, you know, not getting pierced by water-needles. So…
Travis: That’s the thing, man, reflexes! Reflexes are hard to shake!
Justin: [laughing] Yeah, in the moment, you want to do the right thing, but in the heat— to save your old buddy Duck— the heat of the moment…
Ned: Yeah… You’re a good man, Duck, I know you can figure this out!
Clint: And then Ned gets out of the way.
Griffin: All right, I like that. I think your fight-or-flight response kicks in and you roll out of the way as these six tendrils like, stab— you described them as “water needles” and I like that, they just like, stab in your direction, and you roll out of the way and avoid the damage, but as you do, you let go of the towel-chain that you built, and now, Duck, you were holding onto this patio chair inside of the water, and the towels connected to it are just kind of like, hanging down from the sphere, and Ned, you are safe from this danger. [crosstalk] Aubrey, what do you do?
Ned: [crosstalk] Whoo! Close call. [laughs nervously]
Travis: Aubrey is going to hope, and pray, that Duck’s toughness wins out as she blasts the sphere with some fire.
Griffin: Interesting, okay.
Travis: Well, so I’m trying to be really controlled. I looked this up— water turns to steam at 212 degrees, and so I’m hoping, since it was a hot springs to begin with, it’s not going to take much. So I’m not like, aiming at Duck.
Griffin: I get what you’re doing. So go ahead and— this would be a Kick Some Ass roll.
Travis: So I rolled a 10, minus one for Tough— Aubrey, the physical is—
Griffin: No no no, you roll with Weird for your Kick Some Ass-es.
Travis: Oh! Then it’s an 11— then it’s a 12, it’s a 10 plus two then, for Weird, for magic.
Griffin: Okay! On that, you and the water deal damage to each other, but with its—
Travis: On a 12!? Oh.
Griffin: Yeah, on any Kick Some Ass, you and your enemy deal damage to one another. On a 10-plus, though, you pick an extra effect: you gain the advantage, take plus one forward; give plus one forward to another hunter; you inflict terrible harm, plus one harm; you suffer less harm, minus one harm; or you force them where you want them.
Travis: I would like— can I force them where I want them and push them off—
Griffin: Uh, I don’t think that’s how that would work, right? I get that—
Travis: Okay, then I want to grant one forward to Duck.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Yeah?
Griffin: Yeah, I like that.
Travis: So like, use it to create an opportunity for Duck.
Griffin: Sure, for him to escape. Right, okay. So you blast this thing, and— how much harm does your fire spell do?
Travis: Two harm, plus two harm fire. And if you get a 10+ on a combat magic roll, the fire won’t spread. So, four harm.
Griffin: That’s fine, I don’t know how it would have spread, you’re… you’re blasting water. It’s like, essentially, it is dousing your flames as you put them out— as you launch them. You actually get the feeling that you are not doing as much damage to this water with your fire magic than you should be. You are creating a significant amount of steam, which looks fucking rad, like it— it hits the surface of this water sphere, and you know, as the fire contacts it, like, there’s a ripple that travels through the sphere. But it does not seem super effective to combat this thing with fire in the way that you are used to. And I think those needles that were going after Ned like, whip around, and instead of piercing you, they just whip towards you and lash across you, and you take two harm.
Travis: [sucks air through teeth] All right.
Griffin: Duck, you are up. Now, this thing, because it like, turned its attention to Aubrey, some of the water— it’s not like a perfect sphere any more, it’s a bit misshapen, and you get the impression that, if you did want to escape, you would have an opening to do so, [crosstalk] if you can figure out a way to.
Travis: [crosstalk] Did I steam some off, too? Like, did the surface…?
Griffin: Yeah, I think you definitely steamed some of it off. It’s hard to tell, right, you can’t like, identify how much volume of water is floating in the air—
Travis: But I can tell that Duck’s uniform— no wrinkles.
Griffin: No wrinkles. Perfect, perfectly pressed.
Justin: Where am I in relation to Beacon right now?
Griffin: You see Beacon, you’re right next to him.
Justin: And is he within the light? Is he near the light?
Griffin: Yeah. You’re both pretty close to the light.
Justin: Okay. I’m going to grab Beacon and try to stab it into the light.
Griffin: [crosstalk] That’s… radical.
Travis: [crosstalk] What’s that plus one forward do?
Griffin: It just gives him plus one on his next roll, [crosstalk] whatever it is.
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, excellent.
Griffin: You would not get your Read A Bad Situation bonus because you are no longer saving Jake Coolice. Jake Coolice right now is like, climbing out of the empty hot spring, and he’s like, coughing up some water as he does so, but he is safe.
Justin: Okay. A non-great roll, I rolled a six. Which isn’t—
Griffin: Plus tough, plus one.
Justin: Plus tough, so plus two. So, an eight.
Griffin: Plus one, for—
Travis: Plus one.
Justin: Oh. So nine.
Griffin: Okay! What does this look like?
Justin: I reach out and basically grab Beacon’s hilt with my fingertips, I think it’s just in reach, and I sort of— it’s tough, I can sort of make out where the light is, and I can’t really build up much speed at all, I’m still kind of underwater. But as much as I can, I kind of grab both hands on the hilt and just kind of jam it in the direction of the light, hoping that I can get a piece of it.
Griffin: How much damage does your weapon do?
Justin: So that’s one harm for the handle, and then one harm for the blade, so I guess… two?
Griffin: And your weapon has the “Magic” tag, so it does magic damage.
Justin: Yes.
Griffin: So, you—
Justin: And it’s a Area tag, so I don’t know if that assists me in this case, but—
Griffin: That’s for if you’re fighting like, multiple things.
Justin: Right, okay.
Griffin: You stab this thing forward into the light, and as you do so, the light like— you’re right up against it, so you can see it pretty clearly. It like, spasms, in a strange way— I think actually the whole— oh, this is great. Ned and Aubrey, you actually see all the water kind of like, spasm outward, and the sphere actually goes up in the air another few feet, and it forms this weird, abstract shape in the air, almost like this thing is, like, losing control a little bit. And then it all in the blink of an eye, like, sucks back in. And Duck, as it sort of reforms, the pressure inside this water gets like, so intense, it is crushing you like you are, y’know, very very deep in the ocean without a suit. And it actually also gets kind of hot, and you take two harm, ignoring armor as it kind of like, crushes you. But after it does so, Ned and Aubrey, you see the sphere of water now just sort of succumb to gravity, and fall and splash back down into the pool. And it obviously splashes up quite a ways as it does so, and Duck, you see the light quickly zip away and into a vent in the pool, and disappear.
Justin: Perfect!
Clint: [dubious] So the hot springs is connected to the water supply?
Travis: Listen, okay, we could… [stammers] How they eat and breathe, it’s just a show, just relax. [laughs]
Griffin: Technically, the waste water systems and the regular water systems of a city are not connected, and so like, there’s a lot of ways to figure it out. But yeah, maybe you get the idea that this thing doesn’t— it can j— it… is weird, man. [Justin laughs]
[Theme music fades in]
{30:27-40:40 ad break}
Justin: Duck pokes his head out of the water, and he kind of like, puts two fists sort of limply up in the air, and says,
Duck: [unenthusiastically sings Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare]
[Travis and Clint laugh]
Duck: Well… we did it.
Griffin: Jake Coolice laughs, and he’s like,
Jake Coolice: Haha, that was—
Griffin: And he throws up some water, and he goes,
Jake Coolice: Ugh… that was… so… not tubular. [Clint laughs]
Beacon: [drawls] It is a shame, though. While floating in the water, I was so assured of Duck Newton’s destruction, I had begun fantasizing about my next owner. Would they be exciting, willing to take adventures? [Clint laughs] So many possibilities awaited me while I had a pleasant daydream in the water. But I was very… [drawn out] happy to see you survive, Duck Newton.
Clint: Duck’s hat is floating on the water [Justin laughs] and Ned sheepishly picks it up and hands it to Duck.
Duck: Thanks, man. Listen, I get it. [laughs] I do. I mean, I get it. And I guess… it was, let me say this— you had a good idea.
Ned: If it makes you feel any better, I wanted to save you! So my heart was in the right place, but… my nerves, apparently, were not.
Duck: You know what? It doesn’t make me feel better, I’d say zero sum sort of thing. It doesn’t make me feel worse, but that’s— it’s allright, though. So the important thing is that that thing is gone, and Jake Coolice lives to—
Ned: In my defense, I really overestimated the absorbency of the towels. I thought that was gonna really do something.
Duck: You thought— just so I’m clear— you thought you were going to maybe soak the monster up? [laughs] Like the Brawny paper towel man?
Ned: Yeah, I… That was kind of on the peripheral of my idea.
Travis: To be fair, though, Brawny paper towels does advertise that like, Niagara Falls, it sucks it right up.
Ned: Yeah, see! So I’m a victim of advertising.
Duck: It— Ned, in hindsight, I’d like to withdraw me saying that you had a good idea.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: While this is happening, Aubrey is just like, staring at her hands, and she says,
Aubrey: I… I hit it as hard as I could.
Duck: Yeah, me too.
Aubrey: I didn’t do… hardly anything to it.
Duck: I’ll be honest with you all, I kind of imagined “Duck buries his magic sword in the light” was something of an endgame. [chuckles] I didn’t actually, uh, I don’t actually have a Plan B beyond that.
Griffin: Barclay hands all of you some towels and says—
Justin: Dry ones, I hope?
Griffin: Yeah.
Ned: Don’t worry, they’re not very absorbent. [laughs]
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: It seems like we have a lot of stuff to figure out. Let’s head back inside and figure out what comes next, but—
Aubrey: Yeah, so far, listen. I have like, one box to check, and if it’s not fire…
Duck: Right.
Aubrey: Question mark?
Griffin: He says:
Barclay: Yeah, we can figure that out, too, but y’all… it knows where you live now. I gotta… I gotta close down the hot springs until we slay this thing, and the folks here… they need the springs, like, to live.
Aubrey: Yeah.
Barclay: And so not that this wasn’t true before, but time is of the essence.
Griffin: It’s a few moments later now, you’re back in the office drying off with these towels, making sure not to track water in to the very clean lobby of Amnesty Lodge. And Barclay enters after the rest of you, and he is joined by a woman you’ve seen in the lobby several times now. She is always dressed very proper, almost always sitting at the piano. And as the two of them enter and shut the door behind them, she pulls a hairpin out of her hair, and as she does, she takes on a ghostly, translucent form, and she says— What does she sound like? Should I do British on this one?
Travis: Yeah! Do it!
Justin: Sure.
Clint: Oh, yeah.
Griffin: She says, uh…
Woman: [in imperceptibly different accent] Oh my goodness, what a relief!
Travis: That’s British?
Woman: [as Michael Caine] Oh my goodness, what a relief. [Travis laughs] That federal agent has been breathing down my neck all evening.
Griffin: Should I go full cockney?
Woman: [in exaggerated East London accent] Oh my goodness, what a relief!
Travis: It just seems like when you went “British,” you just kind of got very airy.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Wait, yeah, I think British people just speak very airy.
Travis: [crosstalk] You went more like, Downton.
Clint: Yeah, go Eliza Doolittle, Eliza Doolittle.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’m not gonna—
Travis: [crosstalk] [extremely breathy] Oh, my.
Griffin: I’m not going to maintain British, I’m just going to do airy.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: And Barclay says:
Barclay: Moira, we need to get ourselves— our hands on a magical, intangible weapon, and I don’t know what that is, so I’m thinking it’s time our friends here met the Enchanter.
Griffin: And Moira laughs, and she says,
Moira: Yes, I suppose it was only a matter of time. Well, then we should hurry. The moon is large and lovely right now, we should be able to get you all to Sylvain without much trouble.
Aubrey: Sick.
Duck: Okay.
Ned: Groovy.
Travis: Is Moira a ghost?
Griffin: Yeah, it certainly seems that way. [pause] Uh, yeah, she’s a ghost, I don’t know why I’m being cagey about it.
Travis: Yeah, I do want you to picture like, Aubrey running her hand through Moira just— at least once, ’cause that’s what I would do.
Griffin: She says,
Moira: Okay, everybody gets one. Ned and Duck, do you want to get yours out of the way, or—?
Ned: No, I’m going to save mine for later.
Duck: Aubrey can have mine.
[Aubrey gasps]
Moira: Okay Aubrey, you can—
Travis: And I do it again.
Moira: Okay, that’s it.
Aubrey: Can you feel it?
Moira: The idea of feeling is kind of weird for me—
Aubrey: Close your eyes and tell me if I’m doing it.
Moira: Well you already did— okay.
Aubrey: Okay, close your eyes. [pause] Did I do it?
Moira: [tired] Yeah, you did it.
Aubrey: [cheeky] Ahh! I didn’t.
Moira: [trying not to laugh] Okay, this is not a fun game for me.
[Clint and Justin laugh]
Justin: [laughing] Stupid, stupid.
Clint: [laughing] Ah, I love this show.
Griffin: She puts her hand through you.
Moira: [annoyed] Can you feel that?
Aubrey: [enthused] No!
Moira: Yes you can, don’t— Okay.
Aubrey: Do it again, but do it like I’m a mech, you know what I mean? Where— okay, so like—
Moira: You don’t want me to ghost into you. It’s a—
Aubrey: Oh no, wait! Do it, and then Duck, pretend to like, open-palm hit me, right, and then Moira, you go flying backwards out the back.
Moira: We’re not going to do Doctor Strange fanfiction, we got things to do.
Aubrey: C’mon!
[Justin and Clint laugh]
Griffin: The four of you are walking through the forest, toward the gate, and it is indeed lovely tonight; the sky is clear, allowing the moon to pierce the canopy of the pine trees overhead, illuminating your passage through the woods with ease. The remnants of the summer cicadas are singing a quiet song from deeper in the forest, backed by the sound of the fallen pine needles that crunch beneath your feet with each step. And Moira explains,
Moira: So, the Enchanter is a mysterious being. It has taken many shapes and names for as long as I’ve known it. It resides in the catacombs beneath the city, where it does its work, tinkering with imbuing the light of Sylvain into various trinkets and odds and ends that it collects. If you want it to cooperate, though, you’re going to have to deliver it an item of value from this world. Collecting Earth artifacts is one of its favorite pastimes.
Griffin: She reaches into a handbag she’s carrying. She is in her human form, she reaches into a handbag she’s carrying and she retrieves a set of pearl earrings, which she hands to Ned. And she says,
Moira: I think these should suffice for what you all require. It is a crafty one, The Enchanter, but it remains straightforward in its business dealings.
Griffin: She says:
Moira: I would take you directly to it if I could, but… once exiled from Sylvain, we are never allowed to return. Just find your way into the catacombs and follow the sound of the wind, you’ll get there.
[Clint mimics wind blowing]
Aubrey: Do you eat?
Moira: Um, I do not require physical sustenance, just a dip in the hot springs every now and then to sort of refill my… I don’t know, “life force” or whatever you want to call it? We used to—
Aubrey: Mmhm, mmhm. But could you eat? And if you did, would it fall straight through?
Moira: It would be weird, I honestly haven’t tried since I took on this spectral form, but you seem intent to do some sort of—
Aubrey: Were you born a ghost?
Moira: No… When a citizen of Sylvain perishes in the presence of Sylvain’s light, they don’t die, in the traditional sense. They’re given a reprieve, in these ghostly forms, until they’ve decided that they’ve found the peace that they require before passing on for good. That’s actually what makes living on this side such a distasteful prospect for those living in Sylvain— if we die over here, we are not granted that reprieve.
Ned: And what kind of being were you before?
Moira: I was a Sylph! Much like Dani, I suppose. I know of your knowledge of our—
Aubrey: A vampire.
Moira: If that’s the way that you want to classify it, sure, a vampire.
Aubrey: [awed] Okay.
Ned: But we don’t deal with labels, so much.
Moira: I would prefer not to.
Griffin: The four of you arrive at the clearing, and you find a familiar scene. Amidst a blanket of pine needles stands the archway, lit from above by the dazzling moonlight overhead. And Moira reaches into her handbag, and retrieves a small compact mirror, which she catches the moonlight in and directs it towards the gate. And as she does so, the span of the archway is filled with white light, and she says,
Moira: A moment, if you will, Aubrey.
Aubrey: Yeah?
Moira: I know you’re searching for answers about the origins of the magic that dwells within you. If you have the time, you may find it prudent to inquire about your abilities while in Sylvain. It is a land rife with arcane energies; it is likely that someone over there might have some answers to your questions.
Ned: Point of order, Duck: Didn’t the goat-head fellow tell you that you could never set foot in Sylvain again?
Duck: Ah shit, that’s true. Moira, why do you think that would’ve been?
Moira: Ah, obviously, we— I shouldn’t say “we” anymore… The citizens of Sylvain have many reasons not to trust humankind. But if you all are members of The Pine Guard, the arrangement, I believe you’ll find, has changed significantly. You all should be free to walk around there, as long as you have your patches. You all have your patches, right?
Aubrey: Yep!
Duck: Yeah.
Ned: [hesitantly] Yes.
Moira: Ned, you sounded like you maybe don’t have your patch?
Ned: Well, I was wondering if I had had time to get my tattoo yet, but no… No, I’ve got my patch.
Moira: A tattoo is a novel idea, but the patch itself is crafted from Sylvan wool. There’s a curse bestowed upon Earthlings who enter our world, and having a garment crafted from any sort of Sylman— Sylvan fabric will protect you from it, so it’s important you keep the patch on you as well.
Ned: I do, I’ve got in on a s— a scarf.
Travis: Aubrey is just like bouncing to go through the big, glowing doorway.
Griffin: Sure.
Duck: Hey, listen, just a warning y’all. Um… It’s weird over there. [stammers] You know—
Aubrey: Okay bye!
Travis: [giggling] She runs through.
Clint: Aubrey rushes in.
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: [laughs] Yeah. Yeah, I follow behind.
Ned: Oh, shit. [resigned] Alright.
Griffin: The three of you step through the gate. Ned, you last, and I think you see Moira giving you like, a kind of condescending thumbs up, and that’s the last thing you see as you step through. And for a moment, the three of you are all weightless in this bright, white expanse. You feel wind whipping through you, almost as if you’re falling through a long tunnel, and these rings of light are pulsating around you as you fly. And then the three of you step out of an identical gate and into another world: into Sylvain.
[Elegant, mystical piano music starts] {52:46}
Griffin: You’re standing in a large, circular pavilion, surrounded by large stones columns holding up a solid stone roof 20 feet overhead, and through the columns directly in front of you, you can see the city. And, as you might expect, you’ve never really seen anything quite like it before.
There’s a long, dust-covered road that extends outward from this pavilion and serves as a main drag through the town, and it’s lined with shops and restaurants, with outdoor seating, all occupied by diners of shapes and sizes that you can’t quite discern from a distance. And off the road, to the east, the town scales up the side of a steep hill, where these small, colorful cottages are piled on top of one another, leading up to the peak, where a quaint-looking park sits. To the west, a series of several large buildings are arranged.
Just off the main drag, you see what looks like a school, a large library, what appears to be this world’s version of a hospital, more functional buildings, as opposed to the residential district built onto the side of the hill. And though you find something kind of relatable about the layout of the city, there’s something decidedly alien about the architecture. To put it succinctly, where most of our world’s architecture is based around like, clean angles, and rectangular geometry, buildings in Sylvain are more round. Not Seussian, but like… with far more curves, and far less uniformity than any city you’ve ever seen before.
And so the main drag, it cuts across a bridge spanning a small river that cuts the town in half, and beyond it, you see something more surprising still— a castle of gray cobblestone. It’s the largest building in sight, with these huge gardens that extend from its walls, reaching nearly all the way down to the river. And immediately in front of this castle is a large courtyard, which hosts the most eye-catching feature of the entire city: a crystal [Travis gasps softly] jutting up through the ground, standing 15 feet high. There’s a bright orange light pulsating from within this shape. It is an impressive thing, even though the side of it appears to have a large chunk missing, almost as if it’s been cleaved off completely.
And as you all enter through the gate, two guards approach you from the columns in front of you, and they’re both holding spears. One of them has sharp fangs that they’re baring, and bright orange eyes, not unlike the features you’ve seen on Dani in her undisguised form. And the other guard simply has a squirrel head for a head.
Aubrey: [gasps] Duck, get my picture with it!
Ned: Ooh!
Griffin: The squirrel hears you say this, and says,
Squirrel: [booming voice] Do not move, Earthlings. Explain yourselves immediately or face your doom.
Aubrey: I can do self-emote, I don’t have to move.
Griffin: [laughs] The other guard kind of sighs as the other guard says this very dramatic thing, but raises their spear towards you nonetheless.
Aubrey: [dramatically] We are Pine Guard!
Duck: Yeah.
Griffin: They look at each other, and then look back at you, with their spears still raised.
Duck: Uh…
Aubrey: Oh.
Duck: We kind of thought… I’ll, um.
Justin: I dig out my wallet and take the patch out.
Duck: Uh, yeah, we’re trying— We’re from The Pine Guard? Do you all… Does that not mean anything to y’all? We were under the impression that it would be…
Aubrey: I thought that would work.
Duck: Yeah.
Ned: Is that not a thing?
Aubrey: “Pine Guard?”
Duck: Is that not a thing?
Aubrey: Pine Guard? We protect… Earth, and… Mama? [stammers] Do you know Mama?
Duck: Yeah… Moira? She’s a ghost?
Aubrey: Uh, Barclay?
Duck: Barclay? Coolice, Jake Coolice? Any of that ringing a bell?
Aubrey: Mama?
Ned: Dani…? Dani?
Aubrey: Dani? Any of this?
Duck: Dani…? Y’all know Dani?
Aubrey: And we’re Pine Guard, and we—
Ned: Enchanter! Enchanter! Use the— say the Enchanter name. [dramatically] Enchanter!
Aubrey: Why would that be? Okay.
Ned: I don’t know?
Aubrey: Yeah…? Pine Guard? [changes intonation] Pine Guard.
Ned: [warbling voice] Pine Guard!
Griffin: The squirrel turns to the other guard, and like, kind of chitters in its ear, and they like, shake their head, like, “I don’t… I don’t… I don’t know?” But their conversation is broken up as a familiar face climbs the stairs to this pavilion. And you hear a voice say,
Vincent: I thought we had an arrangement, Duck Newton. You care to explain why you’ve returned, despite your promise?
Griffin: And it is Vincent, the goat man.
Duck: [sighs] Hey, Vince. Yeah, I was trying to be… [sighs] We’re in the Pine Guard? I kind of thought that would be all that y’all would need to hear, that’s what Moira said. But you know what, I did— I maybe should’ve put her through due diligence now that I think about it, I did just kind of accept that as gospel, but— we’re looking for an Enchanter, ’cause we got a lot of your people over on the other side that are gonna be in a pretty bad way if we don’t get our hot spring fixed up. There’s some sort of elemental creature, of some sort, that’s making it pretty inhospitable at the moment.
Griffin: He listens to you. As soon as you said you were in the Pine Guard, you see a big smile across his face, and he says:
Vincent: Yes, I figured it was only a matter of time. We only met for a brief while, but I figured that this was probably in the cards. I apologize for the inconvenience, but could you provide some proof of your testimony?
Duck: Yeah, I mean I got… I got it right here.
Justin: I’ve still got the patch in my hand, so I show it to him.
Griffin: He nods, and he says,
Vincent: So you’ve come to see the Enchanter. I assume you need some help hunting down one of the abominations?
Aubrey: We’ve found it a couple times now, and I think it’s going to come for us. We more need help in the killing part of it.
Vincent: And— sorry, what was your friends’ names, Duck?
Duck: Uh, this is Aubrey and Ned.
Ned: Yo!
Aubrey: Hi!
Griffin: He smiles and he says,
Vincent: My name is Vincent. I am the Minister of Defense here in Sylvain. I understand you need to see the Enchanter. I can take you to him—
Duck: Cool, all right, let’s go.
Aubrey: Um…
Vincent: I must insist I accompany you as long as you are in our world, and I must also insist that you make your introductions to the Interpreter, as is custom for those who serve to protect Sylvain from the world beyond.
Aubrey: The Interpret—
Ned: And who is that?
Vincent: My, you seem to not know much about our world at all. I suppose that makes sense.
Aubrey: It’s our first day here!
Duck: Yeah. Like, let me ask you about the… fucking cast of Friends, like what—
Vincent: You’re talking about Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry, and—
Duck: [crosstalk] Ah, fuck. God, son of a— he’s good.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Damn!
Duck: He’s real good.
Griffin: He says:
Vincent: The Interpreter does just that, interprets the will of Sylvain, which helps to form the laws that govern our world. I suppose you could think of them as a kind of ruler, here— unelected, obviously, and with checks and balances represented by their ministers. It is custom for those who serve in the Pine Guard to at least make introductions to the Interpreter. But that can wait, she is resting now as is. We can go see the Enchanter, and then just swing by for a quick pit stop later.
Aubrey: Um, quick question, and forgive me, ’cause I’ll probably end up just like, asking everybody we run into— Do you have like, magic tutors, or a book I could read about— Let me start here: I do magic. Um, both stage and real.
Griffin: He looks surprised when you say that.
Aubrey: Watch!
Travis: Snaps fingers, thumb lights on fire. Boom, there.
Aubrey: See?
Griffin: He gets very close as you do this, and you see like, the light of the fire like, flashing across his face, and his eyes get wide [crosstalk] as he sees that—
Travis: [crosstalk] In his weird, goat eyes.
Griffin: His eyes— his goat eyes are beautiful. He says,
Vincent: This is no parlor trick, correct? This is real magic?
Aubrey: No, do you want to see that though?
Travis: And then, like… card trick.
Griffin: Okay, you do a quick card trick. He says—
Aubrey: I can do both!
Griffin: He says,
Vincent: I… this is quite curious. I suppose I can introduce you to the Minister of the Arcane, in our world, they might be able to help you out with—
Aubrey: Hell yeah!
Vincent: Aubrey—
Duck: Is it… Is it Cornelius Fudge? [snickers]
Vincent: From the Harry Potter books?
Aubrey: God!
Duck: Damn, you’re good, man!
Ned: Jiminy Christmas!
Duck: I cannot get one past you.
Griffin: He smiles, and he says,
Vincent: Aubrey, I must ask… you are not Sylvan, are you?
Aubrey: Hoo-man as they come.
Vincent: I see.
Aubrey: I think?
Vincent: That is quite curious. I think it would serve all of us very well to know where your powers come from. I will make an introduction to the Minister of the Arcane when we stop by the castle. But for now, let’s carry out your errand.
Griffin: And he nods, and the other two guards like, lower their spears, and step back.
Aubrey: Question, do we need to pretend to not be here? Is it going to be weird that we’re here? [drops voice] Are people going to look at us weird?
Vincent: Oh, people are definitely going to look at you weird, but there is an arrangement that has existed between our people and the Pine Guard for some time now, so you will find some amount of understanding from the citizens here.
Aubrey: Okay.
Griffin: And Vincent starts walking you down that main drag, toward the hill, the residential district on the east side of town. And you pass by several blocks of these colorful, round buildings, and as you do, you get a clearer picture of the folks who reside here. A lot of them are like Dani and the guard by the entrance, similar to what our world would consider vampires, with these fangs and bright eyes — some of them have that kind of ghostly form that Moira showed you all, but they seem to just be like, conducting their business in the same way as everybody else here. You see a ghost float out of a bakery, carrying a box of freshly-made pastries—
Travis: [singing Belle from Disney’s Beauty and the Beast] “There goes the baker with his tray, like always…”
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: And this ghost is chatting happily with the shop’s corporeal owner. But you also see a lot of beings with various Earth animal characteristics. You see people with the fur and fangs of wolves, you see more squirrel-like people, you see some bipedal bird people. There’s a lizard person busking on the streets, playing a beautiful song on a harp.
Aubrey: Vincent, can I ask you a quick question?
Vincent: Yes, go ahead.
Aubrey: How long have people been crossing over to our world? Because this would explain a lot of stories and folktales, and stuff.
Vincent: I would not venture to say that we are responsible for all of your world’s lore, that would be— that would be irresponsible of me. But, you could probably trace some of the stories of your world to Sylvans who crossed over and, for whatever reason, made themselves known to the human population. Our worlds have been connected for centuries and centuries, so I would imagine that perhaps some of the stories of your world could be attributed to our people crossing over. But your people have been crossing over into our world for centuries too, and not just humans— animals, too, have wandered through the gates. That’s where I come from; as time passed, the light of Sylvain gave the animals who wandered into our world new forms and gave us a place in our society, which was a rocky transition at first, but now we’re just as much valued citizens of this place as those who originated here.
Griffin: And as he says that, he like, nods to just a… a dog person. A person with the head of—
Travis: I’m a dog person!
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: This is a literal, literal dog person. And finally you reach the foot of the residential district, where Vincent directs you towards a large stone circular door built into the hill which he slides open, and then lights a torch mounted by the door, and leads you down several flights of stairs into the catacombs under the city. And you walk for several minutes through stone-carved tunnels, and the sound of the street and music from the city above fade behind you, until you can only hear wind that is growing louder as you navigate the twists and turns of the catacombs. And finally, you turn a corner, and you see no tunnels in front of you at all; just a platform overlooking a large chasm that swallows the light of Vincent’s torch, expanding into what seems like infinite darkness. And he motions you forward, and he says,
Vincent: Watch your step.
Griffin: And he kind of smiles.
Ned: Hmm. [crosstalk] Is there… is there a safety rail or…?
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Okay!
Vincent: No… I can talk to public works to try to get one installed, I suppose, if that’s a concern of yours?
Ned: No, no, I worry about my... friends. You know, falling off the edge.
Duck: Yeah, I already got two points of armor, man, I’m fine.
Ned: Oof… okay. Um… Uh, yeah, let’s step… very, very, very carefully onto the platform, as close to jumping back as I can.
Aubrey: [pretending to lose balance] Woah, wooahh! Ned, woahh!
Ned: [crosstalk] [wailing] Vertigo! Ohh god!
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Woah, Ned! It’s so—
Travis: And Aubrey’s just fucking with Ned. [laughs]
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Aubrey: Woah, pretty far down, huh, Ned? Woah…! Ned, come look, come look!
Ned: [whimpers] No, I’m good right here. This way I can keep an eye on the—
Aubrey: Ohh, it’s so far… Oh, whoo!
Ned: I want to keep an eye out with my peripheral vision, just, you know… in case of danger.
Griffin: As you all step out onto this platform overlooking the chasm, it is silent for a moment, and then… I think your footsteps like, kick off some dust that you hear fall down the chasm. And then you hear really loud breathing coming from below. Loud, rhythmic breathing, almost like the purring of like, a gigantic cat.
[Clint bursts into laughter]
Griffin: And you hear a voice say,
Voice: [drawn-out, enunciated] What business do you have with me, Earthlings?
[Clint chortles]
Griffin: And this voice just echoes through the whole chamber.
Duck: We require a, uh, a weapon that can defeat… I guess a sort of elemental?
Aubrey: Like water?
Duck: Like a weapon that can kill water? That sounds stupid when I say it.
Ned: Really super-absorbent towels, maybe? More absorbent towels?
Duck: Like magically absorbent, yeah.
Ned: Yeah!
Aubrey: Like a Sham… Like a ShamWow?
Duck: Like a ShamWow…
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Ned: [crosstalk] Oh, yeah. Mmhm.
Griffin: The wind picks up from below you as you speak, almost knocking you off your feet, which is probably pretty scary, given your position, as a massive shape lifts up from the darkness below you. And suddenly, the light from Vincent’s torch illuminates two great yellow eyes with narrow slits for pupils, [Clint chuckles] which eye you over quickly before the figure fully emerges. It is a cat. An unthinkably gigantic gray anthropomorphic cat, and it says:
[Theme music starts] {1:07:38}
Cat: Well, that sounds like quite a challenge! I suppose introductions are in order. The people of this world know me as the Enchanter, master artisan of the arcane— you may call me by my name.
I… am Heathcliff.

Griffin: Previously, on the Adventure Zone…
Barclay: Moira, we need to get ourselves a magical, intangible weapon. I’m thinking it’s time our friends here met the Enchanter.
Moira: I know you’re searching for answers about the origins of the magic that dwells within you. If you have the time you may find it prudent to inquire about your abilities while in Sylvane.
Vincent: I understand, you need to see the Enchanter. And I must also insist that you make your introductions to the Interpreter as is custom for those who serve to protect Sylvane from the world beyond.
Griffin: A massive shape lifts up from the darkness below you. It is an unthinkably gigantic gray anthropomorphic cat, and it says,
Cat: The people of this world know me as the Enchanter. You may call me by my name. I… am Heathcliff.
[others laugh]
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
{1:45}
[Heathcliff by Griffin McElroy begins]
Griffin: So the three of you are standing in front of a chasm underneath this city. The air is still, there’s just this sound of water dripping from the catacombs behind you and the purring of this enormous gray cat with a white patch of fur on its gargantuan belly in front of you. And Heathcliff says,
Heathcliff: I prefer to keep my dealings clean and concise, but I can assume that with your current knowledge of Sylvane being what it is, that would be quite impossible, so, I have what you need and you have what I want, and I do not want this interaction to be interrupted by your ceaseless questions—
Aubrey: Fluffy!
Heathcliff: Yes, much like that, so maybe we could get through this quickly—
Aubrey: Fluffyyy!
Heathcliff: Before we move on: yes, I’m a gigantic cat. No, you may not pet me. You may not pet me.
Aubrey: Who’s a good kitty?
Heathcliff: No, you may not pet me. I just met you. Any other questions before we start?
Duck: I have one sort of query that ends in an interrobang: A talking cat?!
Heathcliff: Yeah. Get used to it, mister, I’m breaking all the rules over here— I talk, yes; I’m the size of a moderately-sized building, yes, that too— I defy expectations in so many ways, but you’ve decided to settle on my power of speech, so that’s sort of your bag.
Duck: So, what’re you doing down here?
Heathcliff: Well, I’m a little too big to fit anywhere topside, aren’t I?
Duck: Well, that’s a fun kind of way of dodging my question. What do you do?
Heathcliff: I find myself surrounded down here by the light of Sylvane in its purest, rawest, most potent form, and so I spend most of my time down here tinkering around with that power. That’s why they call me the enchanter, you see, and that is what has brought you to me today. I assume you seek my services to empower one of your pieces of equipment or perhaps generate a new one for you, as the case may be. I’m assuming that the three of you are human, based on the fact that you do not have fur or fangs or— you are not spectral or see-through in any way and thus therefore are hunting monsters on the other side. I know a little bit about the way of world, so I assume that’s the situation. I assume you seek the same arrangement that I have maintained with the other members of the Pine Guard.
Travis: Griffin, I don’t mean to give you notes, but is it too late to make Heathcliff speak in rhyme?
Griffin: Hmm.
Clint: Hmm.
Travis: ‘Cause it really feels like…
[Clint chuckles]
Griffin: Mmm…
Travis: It really feels like it would take it over the top for me…
Heathcliff: I will do you something magic, in a way that—
Griffin: No, I’m not gonna do that, it’s—
Travis: Okay, but if you see the opportunity for it, will you take it?
Griffin: I will take it, I promise.
Justin: Yeah, like, more rhymes than the average person.
Travis: Yes, yes, yes!
Griffin: [high-pitched voice] What about a riddle?
Travis: Ooh! I’ll take a riddle!
Heathcliff: Any other questions before we move on? Again, I do not wanna be interrupted.
Aubrey: So…
Travis: I have to remember, it’s been so long…
Griffin: It’s been a month.
Aubrey: So, do we just, like, ask you for stuff? And you, like, give it to us?
Heathcliff: I mean, I’m not a mindreader, I’m a cat!
Aubrey: Yeah, we’ll say it out loud, like, I would say “I would like a magic wand!” and you would be like “Yeah!” and hand me one?
Heathcliff: I wouldn’t hand you one, I’d generate you one from the Ether, summoning it from the blackest depths of Sylvane, but yeah, that could be how the arrangement works. You ask, and I shall provide.
Duck: Yeah, I got a request. Do you do exchanges?
[Clint laughs]
Heathcliff: I’m curious to hear what you think would satisfy my mysterious needs.
Duck: Trade ‘em ups? I got this sword, and I would love to trade it for… anything? A nice whip? And when I say a nice whip, I mean a good quality one, but also one that is of a gentle, caring spirit. Y’know, just a nice, kind whip—
Travis: “Supportive…”
Duck: Supportive… won’t be, like, sort of picking at me… constantly. If you have anything, I would love to trade you, and I can kick in… um…
[paper rustling]
Duck: $17.
Heathcliff: I have no need for—
Duck: Hey, that’s Earth money, cousin! All right?
Heathcliff: I’m not familiar with what the exchange rate stands at right now, [Duck: It’s good.] but I won’t be needing that. I am curious about the sword, though.
Griffin: And he extends his gigantic furry paw, and places it on the ledge that the three of you are standing on and says—
Duck: Ah, shit!
Heathcliff: Oh, I’m not— don’t worry, I’m… declawed. Do you mind if I examine your blade?
Beacon: Oh, Duck Newton, this is adorable. A lover’s quarrel, eh, Duck?
Duck: Shut up, Beacon. Jesus Christ. Here, this is the sword, please, anything you got! Here!
Griffin: You hand the sword over to Heathcliff, who raises his paw up to his face and examines it for a moment. He actually takes out a little eyeglass, like a little jeweler’s eyeglass, and examines it very very closely. And he smiles and hands it back to you and he says,
Heathcliff: This weapon is quite curious! Sorry, what was your name?
Duck: Yeah, I’m Duck Newton, it’s a nickname. I’m on the Forestry Service for the Monongahela State Forest, and also, I guess… the Pine Guard.
Travis: Have we ever learned Duck’s real name?
Griffin: I don’t think so. That’s finale material.
Travis: Okay, ‘cause I would like to pitch Ruchard?
Griffin: Ruchard is— Justin, simmer on that, okay?
Travis: ‘Cause, it’s like how Dick is short for Richard, and Duck is short for Ruchard.
Griffin: Oh, that’s quite good, yeah.
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: He says:
Heathcliff: This weapon is indeed, uh… it is imbued with magic, but it is not our magic. This is a curious artifact, Earthling. I would be happy to take it off your hands, provided your ask is fair.
Duck: Whaddaya mean?
Heathcliff: What would you require from me for— in exchange? Other than— would a really good whip really do it?
Duck: Like a NI— I mean it would have to be a choice— aw man. Yeah. I’m losing my nerve… ‘cause Minerva— Oooh! [Clint: Oooh!] Unintentional, but um. Minerva gave it to me and I figure she probably had her reasons. I was acting impulsively, [Travis laughs] Heathcliff, I apologize.
Heathcliff: Hmm. Okay.
Ned: And all you need is Minerva to come here, see it hanging on the wall, all of a sudden there’s bad juju with you guys— Yeah, you don’t want that.
Duck: Right. “Hey, Duck, I’d love to see your great sword. Can you show it to me real quick.” And I do a thing where I’m like “Yeah, it’s in the bathroom, hold on let me go get it.” And then she would go to the bathroom and the window’d be open and I’d be trucking it down the street. Oh call me [inaudible] slamming door farce, we used to call me in college. So, anyway, I’m sorry. I’ve wasted a lot of your time, giant cat, and I’m real sorry about it.
Heathcliff: It’s quite all right. I’m deeply curious about your blade, maybe someday we can find an arrangement—
Duck: I would think you’d be extra careful with being curious there, I’d imagine that goes triple for a kitty of your size, eh?
Heathcliff: Yeah, that is a good point. I do not have many opportunities to be curious down here in the—
Duck: Probably safer.
Heathcliff: Yes, quite. So, you mentioned an elemental you seek to slay and I do not know of this elemental of which you speak but if you need to destroy something intangible, it would make sense that you require a weapon that can attack intangibly. This is kitten’s play. You there, the old one. [Ned: Hmm?] I see there you have a primitive Earth revolver, it is a thing of complete ugliness, but I can give it an arcane makeover the likes of which you’ve never seen if you wish.
Ned: Well, first of all, let me explain. This gun was once owned by Eliot Ness, the famous G-Man and I borrowed it from, uh, a museum. But this is quite a collector’s piece, so what are you suggesting?
Heathcliff: I magic it up, my man. I do some magic on it. Unless you have something else you’d like me to enchant?
Ned: [nervous hum] Now, what’s all this going to cost us?
Heathcliff: I sense upon you an item I have desired for quite some time. The earrings once belonging to Moira. I have admired these pendulous beauties for many years before her exile from this place, a subject I am not at liberty to go on about.
Ned: I’m not exactly sure I know what you’re talking about.
Duck: We’ll trade you the earrings. That’s fine.
Ned: Well, Duck! I don’t— Duck! Duck! [crosstalk]
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Hold on! We’ll trade you one earring for that.
Heathcliff: I’ll make you a deal: You hand me over Moira’s earrings, which I have not seen since she was exiled and I could not possibly— Dish the goss [gossip] on this one, do not press me on it. I hate the goss, and I think it is disgusting—
Aubrey: Can I stop you right there? [Heathcliff: Yes] It kind of sounds like you want to dish the goss.
Heathcliff: I would never dish the goss. [crosstalk] I would never dish the goss.
Aubrey: Ohhh, Heathcliff.
Heathcliff: Tell you what, you hand me over both earrings, I will count them as two gifts to me and therefore will increase the potency of the magicks I imbue your tools with.
Ned: What do you guys think?
Aubrey: Does Ned get one, and I get one, and Duck gets one, or what’s the deal here?
Heathcliff: Oh, there’s no need for me to be that prudent, I’m just chock-a-block full of magic so each of you will receive a gift.
Duck: Oh, hell yeah. Do it, give him the earrings. What do we care? We didn’t even know about him forty-five minutes ago.
Ned: All right, how about—
Aubrey: He makes an excellent point.
Ned: All right! Here, here, earrings! Here there are! They are really lustrous, so try not to schmooze them up with your cat fur.
Heathcliff: No need to be mean.
Griffin: So I have devised a sort of new way of doing the Fantasy Costco item acquisition stuff for Monster of the Week. Which I kinda had to do because it is not nearly an item-rich game as D&D was, right? And D&D could just be like “Oh, you found a more powerful sword and you found a ring that can freeze time or, y’know, whatever.” And that’s not really how Monster of the Week operates so instead, [Roll20 image send sound] I came up with a new rule. Oh Jesus Christ, this is [Clint: Hmm...] this did not come out—
Travis: Well, hold on, can you share it as a doc with us, perhaps?
Griffin: Yeah. How this is going to work. In the future, at the beginning of each new sort of arc here in Amnesty, the three of you will receive a letter from Heathcliff. And that letter will contain a hit-list of three Earth items that he wants. And all three of them will be available at some point during your hunt, but it will often require you to put yourself in harm’s way or a risky situation or something to acquire them.
These will be kind of like sidequests, so I’m not intending you to just be like “Okay, well I’m going to the— Y’know, I’m gonna rob a bank or something so I can get the magic diamond that he needs.” They will be sort of organically in— I will find a way to work these organically into the hunt, it’s just up to you whether or not you want to like take the risk to get them.
So that adds sort of a natural complication to things. Every item that you bring back to him, you will gain +1 on a roll that you do when you visit Heathcliff. So, for instance, if you recover all three items you would roll 2d6+3 when doing this Acquisition roll.
And then, from there, you can either enchant a piece of gear that you already have and make it better. Or you can summon a new piece of gear which won’t be as dope as the pre-existing piece of gear that you already had, that you enchanted, but it will still be a new thing that you can use. And that works with Gear Tags which is a mechanic in Monster of the Week, which your gear already has, like: one harm, two harm, area. I think Beacon attacks in an area, that’s a tag, fire is a tag.
All the tags are sort of— they inform the narrative, they inform what these pieces of gear can do. So on a really good roll you tell Heathcliff, “Oh, I want my sword to have fire on it,” and then you roll and if you roll well then it has it, if you roll a seven to nine you get that tag but you also get a “bad tag” that will complicate that weapon.
If you fail, it gives me narrative tools to use against you. And then if you fail completely, rather than just doing the normal, “You fail and you get one XP,” because this is sort of a high-stakes roll, if you fail this one you actually get two XP, so you still, like, get a nice little boost even if you fuck up. But basically, the more items you recover off Heathcliff’s hit-list, the better chance you have to get a better item. Does that make sense?
Clint: Yeah!
Justin: Yep!
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: So, those are the rules, Ned, do you want to start?
Ned: Absolutely! I believe I would like you to enchant something I already have.
Heathcliff: Okay, let’s have it then.
Aubrey: His butt!
Ned: Well—
Heathcliff: You want an ench— I think it's already quite enchanting!
Ned: Than— [Aubrey: Awwww…] Well, thanks? Um, when we discovered we were dealing with something mostly made of water I thought of this item, which I obtained a number of years ago from a man named Reyn Guyer. He's the man who invented—
Clint: And I open up my coat.
Ned: —the NERF gun. And I want you to enchant this NERF gun that I acquired. It's a very historical piece, very, very sought after. And I thought, perhaps, you could enchant this NERF because, hey, what better against something that's made of water than NERF darts.
Heathcliff: [sarcastic] Yeah, can’t fault your logic there. Uh, that completely [Duck: I can.] holds up to— no, it holds up completely to any level of scrutiny or logic. You want me to enchant your NERF gun, and not your gun gun?
Ned: Yeah! The gun gun doesn't do shit against water things.
Heathcliff: [sarcastic] No, it needs NERF, no, definitely [crosstalk] the power of NERF.
Ned: [crosstalk] And it has to have NERF. So, maybe—
Aubrey: Well, if it ain't NERF…
Ned: It's nothin’!
Aubrey: Exactly!
Ned: Maybe it could shoot harder, maybe? Uhh, maybe—
Duck: Like a really hard-hitting NERF [Ned: Yeah!] Blaster.
Ned: Yeah.
Aubrey: Or you could just put a push-pin in it— In the darts. That really hurts, y’know what I mean?
Heathcliff: Yeah. You were a nasty kid, huh?
Aubrey: [proudly] Yep!
Heathcliff: Okay, I love this. I've enchanted so many things, nobody has thought to bring me a NERF gun, [Ned: Thank you.] um, for obvious reasons. I could give it a magical enchantment that could turn it into the weapon that you desire. Um—
Ned: Awesome!
Heathcliff: Hand it right over.
Griffin: And he extends his paw.
Ned: Here ya go!
Griffin: What's it look like? What kind of— Cause there's lots of different types of NERF guns, and I don't think we have to be historically accurate (crosstalk) here but...
Clint: (crosstalk) It’s the NERF— It’s the NERF Blaster. It kind of looks a little bit like a shotgun, almost.
Griffin: Okay, cool. Um, what’s it—
Justin: I just feel like we're not being cognizant enough of our merchandising opportunities.
Griffin: No, this is amazing—
Justin: You said it looks like a NERF Blaster [Griffin chuckles] then that’s on sale [crosstalk, unintelligible]
Clint: [crosstalk] But it’s not gonna look it after he's done enchanting it, though. Then it’ll [crosstalk] look like—
Griffin: [crosstalk] It's not?
Travis: [crosstalk] Woah…
Clint: —whatever we can manufacture on the cheap and sell.
Travis: A NARF Blaster!
Griffin: It’s BERF! [Travis laughs] Um..
Clint: NERPH. N-E-R-P-H. [Laughs]
Justin: “It’s BERF or Bothin’!”
[laughter]
Griffin: All right, let’s enchant this thing. So, because you [Justin laughs] handed over what counted as two individual earrings, it'll be plus two on this Acquisition roll.
Justin: [gasp] The enchantment, it's changing the branding! [Clint laughs] It’s unlicensed! It's ready for sale! “It’s BERF or Bothin’”!
Griffin: Go ahead and roll 2d6, mac.
Clint: Ooohh…
Griffin: Holy shit. So that is a nine plus two, eleven!
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Okay, I think the tag that works here is “magic” if you want this thing to hurt this water monster. Okay, so he takes your NERF Blaster, your BAR— your BERF [Clint: BERF.] Blaster, and descends— I think I like NARF way better, actually. He takes your NARF Blaster and descends down into the depths, and he’s down there for a few moments and there is a gust of wind and a blast of light from down in the depths that shoots forward to the ceiling of this chamber. And you hear this loud screeching meow from down there and then Heathcliff comes back up and he hands you back your enchanted NARF Blaster.
Uh, the barrel where the shotgun, I guess, balls were previously stored is now this cylinder of what looks like blue stone that is, like, crackling with energy, and it's vaguely in the shape of the chamber that was in there but now it is this sort of magical power device, uh, in the center of your NARF Blaster. And, uh, now it possesses the tag “magic”. Go ahead and— what is your— I think your revolver does two harm. I think this, just to keep it consistent, is a two harm magic [Clint: Umm...] NARF Blaster.
Clint: Is it “close”? ‘Cus “close” is another tag on the .38, but—
Griffin: No, I think this would be whatever the next one is up from “close”, I think—
Travis: Medium.
Griffin: Medium, yeah. I’ll figure out the exact word later.
Clint: Okay, cool.
Ned: I love it!
Griffin: He says,
Heathcliff: Okay, that one was tricky because it was a toy for a baby, but, um—
Aubrey: [offended] Woah! NARF is for big kids!
Heathcliff: You're right, sorry, it's a big kid toy. Um, do either of you— the rest of you have something you would like?
Aubrey: Yes, Mr. Heathcliff.
Travis: And, i’m gonna be honest with y’all, I just raised my hand sitting here. Me, Travis. [Clint laughs] What’s the matter with me? Yeah, I don’t— okay.
Aubrey: I have kept running into a problem with this elemental. I can do fire magic really good and fire magic doesn't seem to be hurting this water thing. I would like to do ice, please.
Heathcliff: Now, wait just a moment. You're an earthling, right?
Aubrey: Yeah.
Heathcliff: Why can you do fire magic?
Aubrey: Don't know.
Justin: A NERFling?
Aubrey: I’m a NERFling!
[Justin chuckles]
Griffin: He eyes you over. He actually lowers his huge face right next to you, and I think you get a better sense of his scale at this point, because his head alone is, like, three times your height. And he leans back and he says,
Heathcliff: [puzzled] You are full of Sylvane’s power.
Aubrey: I had a big meal when I got here?
Heathcliff: No, that’s— I don’t know how you were so infused if you were born on Earth, but that… that is what I see, I can see it as plain as the stars in the sky. Well, if we were above ground, I mean. [Aubrey: Uh-huh.] I can see it as plain as that guy’s hat. I see, though, you want ice magic. Hm. I’m afraid my mastery of the elements is somewhat limited; ironically, I, too, can work in fire. Ice is a little bit above my pay grade. I apologize for the shortcoming, if you have another idea in mind, I can see what I can do.
Aubrey: Okay. I draw a lot of attention with my magic? Anything that would, like, protect me would be great? For when things inevitably get pissed.
Heathcliff: Hmm. I tell you what I can do. I can provide you a limited amount of stealth if you so desire, to one of your garments.
Aubrey: Eh, I don’t really sneak, but if you could just, like, make my jacket magic, that would be great! Something that makes my jacket protect me or something?
Heathcliff: I can make that happen. Lemme see what I can do.
Griffin: And he sticks his paw out.
Travis: And Aubrey hands over her sick ass leather jacket. It’s sleeveless. In case anyone was wondering, it is sleeveless, it’s really badass.
Griffin: That’s a vest!
Justin: That’s a vest.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: Well, it was a jacket at one point in its life, y’know what I mean?
Griffin: Okay. Go ahead and roll Acquisition for me.
Travis: What was it, I can’t see it. Well, that’s not great.
Griffin: It is a seven, plus two is a nine.
Travis: Or is it a 10?
Griffin: No, it’s a 9. You can’t roll twice, my friend. So, with a mixed success on an Enchantment roll, your chosen tag, which would be 1 Armor, does get applied, but I get to pick a negative tag that I can put on it. [amused] I’ve got a good one. He rises back from the depths after the same sort of flash and meow, the whole production, and he hands you your sleeveless jacket. And as he opens up his palm, you see that— what is it made out of? Denim, I think you said earlier?
Travis: Leather. I said leather earlier, but whatever. Denim, sure, let’s go with denim. [Griffin: No, which is it?] That one makes more sense.
Justin: Denim didn’t require any sweet, sweet cows to die.
Travis: Yeah, so we’re gonna go with denim.
Griffin: Okay. Sweet moo cows, we don’t want them hurtin’. Denim, though, comes from the denim… horse, and lots of them got got.
[Laughter]
Justin: [imitating a horse] I’m supple!
Travis: Denim horses are assholes.
Griffin: This is denim flayed from Ted Nugent, so that’s great, actually. He hands you back your denim jacket, and there are threads of just sort of bright red shimmering… well, thread, now coursing through this jacket as he hands it to you, and he says,
Heathcliff: Well, um, it is going to afford you some protection. I'm not entirely sure it'll be the most discreet garment around, but, uh, here ya have it!
Griffin: And he hands you back the jacket.
Travis: How sooo?
Griffin: I've given it the negative tag, “loud”. Loud enough that it draws attention. This is a— [Travis: Oh, cool.] this is a loud garment. It is loud, sort of, visually speaking, and I think it was probably there before, what with all of its patches and buttons and stuff, but [Travis: Yeah...] now it has the tag “loud.”
Heathcliff: And Duck, anything you require my friend?
Duck: [blows air] You do jet packs?
Heathcliff: [shocked] A jet pack, huhhhhh... huuuh… a jet pack?
Duck: Mm-hmm.
Heathcliff: I'm looking—
Duck: You do jet packs?
Heathcliff: Yeah, I mean, I'm think— I’m thinking.
Duck: Just asking. I get to ask for anything, and I just— I always kinda wanted a jet pack, so I thought I'd ask.
Heathcliff: I could— I could give you a jet pack. I make no guarantees as to whether or not it would let you fly around or not or if it would explode. I've never made a jet pack before, you gotta understand.
Duck: Not a very— very good jet pack, really.
Heathcliff: Alright, I’ll make you a fucking— I'll make you a fucking jet pack, my friend.
Duck: No, but I mean if you can't promise me that it's gonna let me, like, fly and be alive then I [crosstalk] would say it sounds like—
Heathcliff: [shouting] No, let's make a jet pack, because now I'm feeling attacked! Let's make a fucking jet pack!
Duck: Can I actually say, I feel like I don't actually— I'm not sure I want the pressure of having [crosstalk] a jet pack.
Heathcliff: [shouting] No, one jet pack coming right up!
Duck: People expect big things from a man with a jetpack. That is kind of my— one of my concerns.
Griffin: He very slowly starts descending into the depths, like:
Heathcliff: Here I goooo! [crosstalk] Jet pack—
Duck: You gotta produce if you got a jet pack, y’know?
Heathcliff: Jet pack time!
Duck: I mean, if you could make a good one. [Clint laughs] You kind of spooked me— you spooked me with a little bit of the jet pack— he's gone. He's just gone down in his hole.
Griffin: If you— actually, as you peer over the edge of the chasm, you see him looking up, still, like, very slowly descending into the chasm, [Justin laughs] like,
Heathcliff: Okay, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna make a jet pack!
Duck: If you could make a cool jet pack then I'll want a jet pack, but, like, you said we could ask for anything. You didn't really put any boundaries and, like, that's the thing that I would like is a jet pack, and I feel like I could make use of it. I thought about enchanting Beacon, but he probably wouldn't even let me.
Beacon: [long pause] Yesss…
Justin: I was waiting for Beacon to respond.
[laughter]
Travis: God, we’re all on a certain meta-level today! Hands raised. Waiting for our own character to respond to us.
Justin: [imitating a therapist] Is Beacon there, Justin?
[Travis laughs]
Justin: [imitating a therapist] Can I talk with Beacon?
[Clint and Justin laugh]
Duck: Do you have a really— do you have any really quiet sheaths? Just some really, really quiet sheaths?
Griffin: He pops back up–
Heathcliff: You don't want to make the— make a jet pack? What do you want, a sheath or a jet pack? So you don't want the jet pack? Aww, I was so excited to make a jet pack. I can find a way to make you a jetpack.
Duck: It would output a lot of fire and I don't— that would be a forest risk. It wouldn't even be a most convenient way of getting around the forest, which is kinda the main thing I was hoping for. Yeah, so— I— yeah, jetpack. But, [Clint laughs] like, a magic one and not, like, a fire one. Can you do that?
Heathcliff: [chuckles] You're really tying my paws here. You want a jetpack but a magic one, not a fire one?
Duck: Yeah.
Heathcliff: You have to understand, when I create an item like this, I summon it from the ether. I have to have a crystal clear picture of it in my mind, and what you've just described is an object that doesn't exist. And yet, I just enchanted a old, old NARF gun and so I'm feeling a little feisty. I'm feeling like I'm on a hot roll right now, as nobody says. So yeah, one magic jetpack coming right up!?
Griffin: And he descends down into the chasm. Go ahead and roll Acquisition.
Justin: You watch, it's gonna be, like, a three. C’mon, big money, big money, big money! [disappointed sigh]
Griffin: That a six plus two, that's an eight.
Justin: [dejected] All right…
Griffin: He— so, uh, what Ned and Aubrey did is enchanting, uh, what you did is summoning [crosstalk] which is sort of—
Travis: [crosstalk] Thank you!
Griffin: ...different rules. [Justin chuckles] Uh, on a seven and nine, the summoning works but the item suffers during its creation. It has a positive and negative tag chosen by the Keeper and it also has “fragile” as a tag. Uh, which is just sort of a narratively focused tag that, if things go very, very wrong, it can break. Uh, but he comes up from the depths and he has kind of a confused look on his face and he's like:
Heathcliff: I made it as good as I can. I'll say this, this is the best magic jetpack in existence.
Duck: Thanks.
Heathcliff: So you can feel confident about that, but, uh, here ya go!
Griffin: And he extends his paw and opens it up and you see a magic jetpack. Um, I kinda like the visual of it being like two criss cross belts that go around your chest with an apparatus on the back that does the propulsion. Because you invented this from your mind's eye, maybe you could tell me what it looks like.
Justin: Well, I'm trying to think if Duck’s— with Duck’s age, I think it is pretty close to The Rocketeer. Sort of that, like, art— a little bit of, like, Art Deco, that vibe. I don't know anything about architecture design or anything, but— yeah, that sort of, like, retro— Retro-futurism. That's the word I was looking for, thank you. Uh, that [crosstalk] sort of—
Travis: You're welcome.
Justin: That sort of vibe. Silver, two canisters that reach two points, and I feel like, from the bottom of them, there's just sort of like a blue-purple constant thrumming that just, like, makes them seem very scary. Like, ready to blow at any second.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, I like that a lot. The tags—
Justin: I feel like Duc— it has an appearance that— as Duck sees it he makes the instant decision that it will be behind glass, “Use in case of emergencies only.”
Griffin: That is a good idea. This thing has the “fragile” tag as a result of your roll. It also has a positive and negative tag at my discretion. I'm going to give it the positive tag “quick,” which is normally reserv—
Justin: [Through laughter, sarcastic] So much better than slow jet packs.
Travis: Yeah, right.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: “Do you wanna take the jetpack?” “No, let's just walk. Are you kidding me?”
Griffin: It also has the negative tag “volatile” of course. This weapon is dangerous and unstable, or, rather, this jetpack is dangerous and unstable. So, it'll get you there and you can do some cool aerial stunts with it, but you better roll so good when you use it. So go ahead and add “magic jetpack” to your inventory there, Duck.
Justin: Alright, got it baby!
Griffin: And mark down those tags.
Justin: It’s called the “Fly Master” by the way.
Griffin: Sure, of course it is.
Justin: That's what it says on there.
Griffin: Because it has to rhyme—
Clint: -with NARF Blaster.
Griffin: Yes, all the items rhyme today. Heathcliff smiles and he takes those two earrings and he says:
Heathcliff: Well, it seems like that's a good day of doing biz. I will see you all next time you've run into a quandary that need my magical services to assist you in.
[Heathcliff fades in]
Griffin: And he takes those two earrings and he closes his giant paw around them and gives you a little wink and then descends down into the depths with a whoosh. A magic whoosh.
{31:55-39:24 ad break}
Griffin: So Vincent has led you all back through the catacombs and onto the surface of Sylvain, back through the avenue of shops and restaurants, and across the bridge spanning the river at the center of town, right to the entrance of the castle that you spotted during your arrival. It's time to make yourselves known to the Interpreter as you sort of promised when you showed up here.
And he takes you across that bridge and you are now in the courtyard in front of this castle. It is a courtyard leading up towards a large staircase into the castle’s imposing front door. And as you walk through this courtyard you see that big orange crystal that you saw earlier up close. And, Aubrey, whatever attunement you have to magic stuff, you can feel the power radiating out of this thing. You feel a warmth coming from it. You almost feel like a sad longing emanating from it, too.
Travis: Ooh…
Griffin: All you, though, see something even more concerning at its base. There's a fleet of city guards standing in a perimeter around the crystal and they are shepherding a line of residents of Sylvain in a queue toward it. And, one by one, these residents, they reach the front of the line and they produce a slip of paper to the guards and they proceed to touch the crystal, just for several seconds, before another guard steps in to quickly usher them away. And Vincent says:
Vincent: Uh, I would appreciate it if you would all give that crystal a wide berth.
Aubrey: What is that?
Vincent: Well, that's the Heart of Sylvain. It's what sustains all of us over here.
Aubrey: What's everybody doing?
Vincent: They're getting their allotment of life for the day. They're filling up the old tank.
Travis: Aubrey looks at Duck and Ned, like:
Aubrey: So, what should we do, y'all feel that?
Duck: Yeah, I don't feel anything.
Ned: No, huh-uh.
Aubrey: Vincent, um, I can feeeeeel the crystal. Is that normal?
Vincent: What do you feel, Aubrey?
Aubrey: Uh, like it wants a hug. Like, I wanna touch it.
Vincent: You absolutely can't touch it, Aubrey.
Aubrey: I wanna touch it, though. Like, really bad, I wanna touch it.
Griffin: Vincent has been, like, very, very affable for all of your interactions that you've had with him so far. But, when you sort of reinforce that, his demeanor changes, and he says:
Vincent: Aubrey, you absolutely cannot touch it. I forbid it.
Aubrey: What would happen?
Vincent: I don't know what would happen, but—
Duck: Seems like she can touch it then, right?
Aubrey: If the— like, the crystal wants me to touch it, it feels sad.
Griffin: He gestures to the crowd of people waiting to touch the crystal and he says:
Vincent: Wouldn't you be sad, seeing this?
Griffin: He says:
Vincent: You can't touch the crystal. Earthlings are forbidden to— the crystal was damaged by, as you can see.
Griffin: And he gestures up and, sure enough, there is a huge chunk just, sort of, carved off the side of it. He says:
Vincent: It was damaged long ago by an attack from your world against ours. That was led by humans, Aubrey. Humans are forbidden to even usually be this close to the crystal. Its power has faded since that attack. There's not enough light to go around. It is a sad state of affairs in Sylvain and it's solely because of your people, so, no, you cannot touch it. C’mon, let's go they're [crosstalk] expecting us.
Aubrey: Aren't you curious though, like, why I can feel it?
Griffin: He sighs and he says:
Vincent: I am, but not enough to allow something so risky, so profane. C’mon.
Griffin: And he leads you into the castle. You head into this large entrance hall, where there is a long blue carpet leading up between about a dozen pillars of carved marble lining the other side of the carpet. Each one has an armed guard stationed in front of it. And you walk down this carpet to the end of the hall where there is a large, wooden door. And he stops and he says:
Vincent: So, I've gotta go in first. A guard will tell you when you're allowed to enter. You all seem quite pleasant, your obsession with touching the forbidden crystal aside, and I would prefer to continue working with you as the Pine Guard if possible. You would not believe some of the humans I've had to interact with over the past few decades.
Aubrey: Ooh, dish!
Vincent: I'm not going to dish the goss.
Aubrey: Dish the goss!
Vincent: I am not like that big cat downstairs.
Aubrey: Oh, are you gossiping about the big cat?
Vincent: Oh, you've caught me in a trap! Anyway, I like the three of you, so please be on your best behavior in there. I know how vital the work you do on Earth is for our peace to stay intact, but the rest can't be said for all Sylvan kind. Just keep a level head, you're gonna do great.
Griffin: And he gives you a big, furry thumbs up and he slips through the door and closes it behind him.
Ned: I know one thing about Sylvain, the military has gotta be the number one employer. There's guards every whipstitch!
Aubrey and Duck: Whipstitch?
Ned: It’s a colloquialism.
Aubrey: [crosstalk] Okay...
Duck: [crosstalk] Alright.
Aubrey: I know what Ned’s gonna say… Duck!
Duck: Yeah?
Aubrey: I want to touch.
Duck: Yeah, you've made that pretty clear.
Aubrey: Yeah, I wasn't secretive, but, maybe not right now—
Duck: Right?
Aubrey: —but, like, at some point you gonna help me out with that?
Duck: Why do you need to touch it?
Aubrey: I don't know, Duck! It's just— okay, imagine walking by, say, a tree and suddenly that tree made you, like, buzz and, like, you could feel the presence of that tree, and I mean really feel that tree. Do you think you would just be like, “Hm, cool,” and keep walking by it?
Duck: Yeah, it doesn't exactly work like that, but I see where you're coming from.
Aubrey: Right!
Duck: But, um, I don't necessarily wanna get on the bad side of these fellas and ladies. It seems like kind of a dangerous thing to try. I mean, they say you shouldn't touch the crystal.
Aubrey: I'm not gonna touch it now, and I will continue to work through the proper means to convince them to allow me to touch it.
Duck: Yeah, I mean, if you file all the required permits--
Aubrey: But at some point!
Ned: No, no, that's not the way to go. Ya gotta bend the rules a little bit!
Aubrey: No. Thank you, Granddad Devil. I knooow, at some point... [quickly] I might have to break the rules to touch that stone. And Duck, I'm gonna need you to be okay with that. I'll give you a heads up before it happens.
Duck: Maybe the opposite. Maybe even the opposite. Maybe you just don't tell me that it's happening and maybe [Aubrey: Okay.] I'm not around. How's that sound?
Aubrey: We'll figure it out.
Duck: Okay, well, tell you what, maybe we shou— I've had a hell of a good time shopping and not touching crystals today. We do have the one water monster that has marked us for death [Ned: Mm-hm.] that we may wanna go ahead and [Ned: There's that.] see if we can rectify that situation. Then we'll get back to all the great shopping and crystal talk that this podcast [through laughter] is known for.
Griffin: [Giggles] You hear the sound of a spear’s butt hitting the ground and the door in front of you opens and you enter into the castle’s royal hall.
[Sylvain fades in]
Griffin: It is a cold room almost entirely carved from the same marble as the columns outside with a ceiling that stretches into the heavens, painted with an intricate mural of dozens of Sylvans of all shapes and sizes, all just touching the crystal. Almost as if to taunt you, Aubrey.
And surrounding you are rows of benches that climb the walls of the rooms, designated for observers to come and watch the proceedings that take place here. They are all completely empty. In front of you are three tall pedestals adorned with crests noting various royal titles. And seated on top of them are three individuals who, based on the crests beneath them, you assume serve important roles in this city.
There is the Minister of the Arcane, a short Sylvan woman dressed in a thick coat with several thick scarves draped around her neck. She's reading a large tome atop her pedestal and does not appear to acknowledge your presence as you enter.
In the center pedestal is the Minister of Preservation, an older, large spectral man, who looks down from his pedestal at your entry, intensely eyeing you with disdain.
And atop the final pedestal is the Minister of Defense. It's Vincent, who gives you a wink and a quick okay gesture with his hand as you step inside. And the door shuts behind you and the sound echoes through the chamber. The three ministers are sitting atop their pedestals, silently. They say nothing as you enter.
Aubrey: Should we kneel?
Duck: Yep, maybe.
Minister of Preservation: [shouting] Silence!
Duck: O-okay…
Griffin: The spectral man shouts,
Minister of Preservation: You will not speak until the Interpreter has arrived. Do you understand me?!
Duck: ..Yea-
Minister of Preservation: [shouting] Silence! Silence, god!
Travis: In the meantime, Aubrey, almost offhandedly because she's been doing it so much, kinda starts nervously doing her little fire jumping from finger to finger.
Griffin: The spectral man sees you and says,
Minister of Preservation: What are you doin— don't make a fire! Just wait silently for [crosstalk] the Inter—
Aubrey: No, I was just practicing [crosstalk] I didn't even—
Minister of Preservation: Silence, c’mon! We had a whole thing about silence!
Aubrey: I didn't even notice I was doing it, sorry.
Ned: You people are so rule-oriented. [crosstalk] Just relax!
Minister of Preservation: Oh my god, the non-silence is almost unbelievable at this point. It’s— oh, oh, oh!
Griffin: And he hushes up as the sound of a loud creak fills the chamber and you see a door behind the three pedestals open and a Sylvan girl, no older than 13 you would estimate, steps through the door and onto a platform that is raised behind the three pedestals. She looks tired, partially because she's wearing what appears to be a long nightgown that reaches her feet. And there is a humble throne on this platform which she approaches and puts a hand on but doesn't sit down in. And she peers over the railing of this platform and looks at the three of you one at a time and then gives a faint smile and says:
The Interpreter: Nice to meet you.
Griffin: And then she turns and shuffles back through the door and out of the royal hall. And the Minister of Preservation, atop of his pedestal, says,
Minister of Preservation: Yes, well… another inspiring declaration. So then, humans, go ahead, introduce yourselves.
Aubrey: Okay?
Duck: I'm Duck Newton, it's a nickname. I'm from the forestry service, the Monongahela State Forest and the Pine Guard, apparently.
Minister of Preservation: You smell of, uh, earthen mulch. It's not entirely unpleasant. Usually your kind have a certain stink about you. Yours is above average.
Duck: Yeah, I'm not sure where you'd be getting the mulch from. That's a—
Minister of Preservation: Just dirt. Dirt has— like, fresh, [crosstalk] nice, good forest dirt.
Duck: Dirt… uh... oh, dirt! Sure, yeah, yeah. Dirt, woods.
Aubrey: Uh, my name is Aubrey Little. You can call me The Lady Flame, if you’re a fan, and, um, I'm kind of from all over. Human, Pine Guard, and I am dying to know what I smell like.
Minister of Preservation: Mm, yours is... unremarkable. You smell of denim. You smell of crisp denim.
Travis: [imitating the Minister of Preservation] Fresh from the horse.
[laughter]
Ned: And I am Ned Aloysius Chicane, master of all I survey!
Aubrey: What?
Duck: Hmm.
Ned: [talking with a full mouth] Toastmaster!
Aubrey: Okay.
Minister of Preservation: Are you eating something right now?
Justin: Do you have something in your mouth?
Minister of Preservation: Do you have some— do you have a jawbreaker [crosstalk] in your mouth?
Justin: Dad, do you have a jawbreaker in your fucking mouth? You legally have to tell me if [crosstalk] you have a jawbreaker in your mouth.
Clint: No! I don't do [crosstalk] jawbreakers.
Justin: We made podcast history—
Clint: [defensive] I don't do jawbreakers anymore! I have—
Justin: Are you eating during the show? Is it ice? You have to tell me legally.
Clint: If that's the truth, look on the camera.
Justin: Everybody rewind your audio.
[crosstalk]
Griffin: We all heard it.
Justin: Second-guess my dad. You heard it.
Travis: Is this like, now you're saying you're not eating now. Were you eating 30 seconds ago when we started asking about it?
Clint: I did have a bite.
Justin: Ah okay! ‘Kay hungry boy, what is so important that you had to eat it during this great podcast?
Travis: Which, I will let everyone know, is at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, not a traditional meal time.
Clint: I have blood sugar issues, you guys.
Justin: Here we go.
Travis: [disbelieving] Uhh-huhhh.
Justin: Here we go. [crosstalk] Here we go.
Clint: [defensive] Maybe you don't know that, but I do have these issues I have to deal with.
Griffin: He says,
Minister of Preservation: Uh, I see, I see, I see. Have the three of you any confirmed kills of the Abominations on the other side? Do you have anything to prove your mettle?
Aubrey: Yeah, actually we put one down.
Minister of Preservation: I see, I, uh, I suppose you will do, not that we have any choice in the matter. So, my name is Woodbridge, Minister of Preservation. I ensure the—
Aubrey: Hi!
Woodbridge: Hi, yes. I ensure the survival of our kind in the wake of your world’s countless ruthless assaults.
Aubrey: Yeah, we can be real assholes.
Griffin: And he points to the woman dressed in all of the thick clothing to his side and says:
Woodbridge: This taciturn individual to my right is the Minister of the Arcane, Janelle, who spends her days in unending study of Sylvain’s deepest mysteries. And to my left is Vincent, Minister of Defense, whom I assume, based on the fact that he winked at you as you entered, that you've already befriended. I encourage you to take that endorsement with a large grain of salt, he has never met an earthling whom he was not instantly fond of.
Aubrey: Um, Miss Janelle, was it?
Griffin: Uh, she does not acknowledge you. She is nose-deep in this book that she’s reading.
Aubrey: I'm a human that can do magic.
Griffin: That does it. [chuckles] She looks up, just a second, and kind of eyes you over.
Aubrey: Watch! [makes fire noise, like bszzhhh]
Griffin: What is the [bszzhhh]? You can't just say [bszzhhh].
Travis: It's like a fire in my hands, like I'm holding a flame.
Griffin: Sure, since you're trying to do it to accomplish something, right, you're trying to do it to impress this person and I think you should probably roll Use Magic.
[Roll20.net sound]
Travis: Ohh, not great. Uh, it's a— ohh, a six.
Griffin: Yeah, go ahead and mark experience there, Aubrey, and there is a glitch. Oh, it's not a glitch, on a miss— [chuckle] okay, this is what it says for Use Magic. “On a miss, you lose control of the magic. This never ends well.” So, you do whip up a zesty fireball, but, instead of staying put in your hand, it launches forward, as if with a mind of its own, toward the pedestal of the Minister of the Arcane, who reflexively ducks down beneath her pedestal as the fire ball collides with it, setting it ablaze and—
Aubrey: Tha— that was an accident!
Griffin: And—
Aubrey: That was an accident!
Griffin: And engulfing the book that was sitting on top of it. And after that impact, you see her reappear and wave her hand. And, as she does so, the fire swirls and then dies down and she sits back down at her pedestal and looks at the now charred and destroyed book in front of her. She kind of sighs, closes the book, and peers at you.
Aubrey: I cannot stress enough how much of an accident that was, and also, if you think about it, a clear indication that I might need your help.
Griffin: Uh, Woodbridge, the Minister of Preservation, looks horrified that you just seemingly attacked one of the ministers, but Janelle says:
Janelle: It's fine, Woodbridge, its fine. I mean, this book was rumored to contain the secrets of a spell that, if prepared properly, could cure any known disease, and I had just gotten to the good part, but oh well. Spilled milk and all that. So, what can I do for you?
Aubrey: I... am good... at fire, sort of. All evidence to the contrary. Um, but that's all I can do and I need more control and I need more versatility and I need to be able to do things other than just set stuff on fire, please. If you could just— I will read a book about it if that's easier, or if you wanna, like, tap me on the forehead and I fall asleep for a minute and I come back and I know a bunch of stuff, that would be great. Or if there's, like, a magic pie I could eat, that would be cool. Whatever you've got, I need it.
Janelle: [sarcastic?] Unfortunately, I am fresh out of magic pie, so we may have to do things the old fashioned way. I need you to understand though, Aubrey, I live a life that necessitates unwavering focus on my studies to unlock Sylvain’s secrets so that our people might live a better life. And yet, your presence here is a puzzle I will no doubt be consumed by until it is solved, which is deeply, profoundly inconvenient. That being said, I have set aside a few brief moments of each day from my studies to fulfill my biological requirements and breathe a few breaths of the sweet night air. I suppose I can grant you some of this time, Aubrey Little. I will learn how you came across your fledgling power and you will learn from me how to hone it. All that I would ask is that, when you do visit me for these lessons, you will wait for me to be ready. Tell me, is patience one of your more valued virtu—
Aubrey: Yes!
[Justin laughs]
Griffin: [Giggles] She smiles.
[Clint and Justin laugh]
Travis: Thank you everybody, I'll be here all day!
Griffin: She says:
Janelle: No, I detect an unrelenting impatience that dwells within you. It makes sense now that fire is the element that has answered your call. Fire is foolhardy, it is impulsive, it is a force of blind destruction. You treat it as a weapon and it behaves as such. Consider this until next we meet, Aubrey Little, you cannot speak to the other elements because you do not know their language. You will be unable to harness all of the elements until you stop thinking of them as primitive weapons and instead treat them as they truly are, as blessings from a cosmic force beyond your current comprehension. I look forward to our first lesson.
Griffin: And then she reaches into her pocket and she pulls out what appears to be a small pocket watch, which she looks over, and says:
Janelle: Three minutes and 51 seconds. I'll have to make this up tonight.
Griffin: And then she reaches under her pedestal and retrieves another gigantic book, which she cracks open and dives right back into.
Aubrey: O-Okay…?
Griffin: Woodbridge says, uh:
Woodbridge: Do you have anything else? We already sort of did the big meeting with the Interpreter, so… if you—
Aubrey: Who is that, by the way?
Woodbridge: The Interpreter is, um, something of a leader of our community. She literally interprets the will of Sylvain by speaking to it and understanding its—
Aubrey: Like the stone?
Woodbridge: The stone is but a part of Sylvain. Sylvain is the planet upon which we all stand.
Aubrey: But she can speak to the stone?
Woodbridge: She can speak to the planet!
Duck: She seemed kinda disinterested. Is that fair to say?
Woodbridge: I do not think it's appropriate to comment on her demeanor. Her job here is impossible for any other person alive to do, so I would not hold her exhaustion against her, Duck.
Aubrey: Is she actually a teenager, or is this one of those Narnia things?
Woodbridge: She is young, yes, she is fairly new to the role that has been placed upon her shoulders. It is not one of these Narnia things.
Duck: [scoff] Can we go back yet?
Woodbridge: Yeah, I wish you would, it would be great!
Duck: Excellent, ‘cause I feel like we're about as well-equipped to do what we need to do.
Woodbridge: Yeah, is that a jet pack? What's going on there?
Duck: Please be careful with it. It honestly scares the shit out of me. I don't even really like carrying it, I'm really getting pretty stoked about taking it home. I'm half-tempted to leave it on the ground as we go back to our world, but I figure I'll hold on to it. If nothing else, I can chuck it at something and try to blow it up. [crosstalk] It’s called the Fly Master.
Woodbridge: [crosstalk] Um— uh, rad name. Please do go, though. That would be fantastic for me, and for— you know, everyone.
Aubrey: Yeah, I guess we’ll go, and I’ll think about my magic as a gift from the cosmos...
Griffin: The guards by the door pound their spears down again and it opens, and the three of you head back out to the entrance hall, and moments later you are met by Vincent who seems winded after running all the way down here to meet you. And he walks with you back through the city to the archway, back to Kepler, and he nods to the squirrel-headed guard, who catches the moonlight on their shield, and shines it on the gate, which fills with light, and Vincent says:
Vincent: Uh, you all did fairl— you know what? It actually didn’t go the best, because you did almost explode one of the ministers, which I— to be fair to you, I didn’t say you shouldn’t do, but I thought it maybe would have been assumed that you shouldn’t try to blow up? One of the people you are meeting with? But it seemed like she was okay with it, so, I would say five outta ten.
Aubrey: I’ll take it!
Ned: Yeah, that’s not bad for us!
Griffin: He says:
Vincent: Um, one thing before you go. Have any of you seen any good movies lately? [Aubrey: Hmm?] [Duck: Sorry?] I know it’s not really part of the gig, I just, I’m fascinated by your world’s pop culture, it’s— it’s not important, I just thought if you had any recommendations, or reviews, or— Mama used to smuggle me in some DVDs from time to time.
Aubrey: Have you seen Black Panther yet?
Vincent: I have not, it is— is that one out on one of your DVDs?
Aubrey: Not yet, but when it is? I’ll get ya a copy, it’s— oh.
Ned: Does the name Tommy Wiseau mean anything to you?
Vincent: He’s from our world.
[Laughter]
Justin: There it is. [crosstalk, not sure about this bit] That’s not— at all—
Vincent: [crosstalk] Yes, I hear that’s something of a mystery in your world, uh, where he originates from, and I can go ahead and put that to bed, he is a mummy man. So, yes, I’m very familiar with him, quite a scoundrel, that one.
Duck: Listen, this is— at what point I—
Vincent: You’re right, the mons— the monster, it’s so much more important than, like, my hobby or whatever, so…
Ned: Well we can bring you, we’ll bring ya something, we’ll hit Redbox, and make you a bunch.
Vincent: Ok, that sounds perfect. Ok, good luck!
Aubrey: Ok bye!
Griffin: And the three of you step through the archway.
[Sylvain fades in]
Griffin: Ned, it is Saturday night— late Saturday night, and that means it's time for your big television debut for “Saturday Night Dead,” the television show that you do because you said you did it, like, three episodes ago. You're back at the Cryptonomica, it is after everything else that transpired today. By the way, this whole arc so far has just been one very wild day that you all have had, and now you're coming down off the end of it. And you're back at the Cryptonomica about to do a quick television show. Can you give a little bit of flavor for “Saturday Night Dead”? What's the vibe you're going for here?
Clint: Well, uh, I don't wanna go full on old-school horror movie night. We're using cameras in the Cryptonomica and, because of that, it's kind of a natural setting, but it'll be sorta like a, uh, Night Gallery feel. Maybe I'm standing in front of the case with, uh, George Washington's upper plate or, y'know, I'm standing in front of the case with Blackbeard’s treasure or something, so it's always visually very different, very atmospheric.
Griffin: Are you dressed up like the Cryptkeeper or is it just sorta [crosstalk] Ned giving you full Ned.
Clint: No! No, I don't want it to be quite that hokey, but Ned is a very stylish dresser, y’know. He's got the long scarf and he's got the clicks and the weskit. Y’know, he's dressed for it. I mean, he wants to put on a good show.
Griffin: Alright, I think there's a couple folks from the TV station, which is only one of, like, a very small handful that services, like, a pretty large area, since you all are in the Radio Quiet Zone. They're just sort of operating the lights. There's probably a camera person there. And then you have Kirby with a headset on, I think, helping out with just, sort of, some stage management— [matter-of-factly] uh, that's what they call it for television shows. [Travis: Yep.] And he slides the headset off and walks over to you and he's like:
Kirby: Ned, man, I gotta tell you, I'm pretty nervous. This is— um, I feel like we didn't rehearse this at all. In fact, I kinda thought we had a dress rehearsal scheduled for earlier in the day, but then you weren't here at all today and so I just think that maybe this has a good chance at being a big disaster.
Ned: I missed that, I'm sorry. I should have checked my Google calendar, but it'll be fine! Listen, this is all about energy, Kirby. This is all about bringing a spontaneity and a excitement to a— it's a live show, a live program beaming into literally tens of people's homes! Let's use that nervousness, use that fear, that energy to create something amazing!
Kirby: Yeah, I mean, that's all gonna be on you. I think it's gonna go quite bad, but, um, good luck. We're on in five! Four! I'm doing the thing with my hand! Thr— two! I can't tal— [quietly] one! Go.
[spooky music plays]
Ned: Welcome my friends! This is Saturday Night Deeead! Live, or, I should say, dead [maniacal laugh] from the Cryptonomica! I am your host, Ned Superstar Chicane, and I welcome you to this palace of the bizarre, this home for humbuggery. This is the place where you can surrender yourself for the next two hours to enjoy one of the finest science fiction-horror movies ever made, set here in the fabulous Cryptonomica. Our movie tonight is Beast with a Thousand Eyes, so tonight we are going to take you through this movie and also let you come to know some of the amazing things we have here at the Cryptonomica, located just off Route 61155, all you have to do is come down and see us. We're open eight hours a day, five days a week, three hundred and forty-two days a year. And we're there to serve all of your bizarre, weird needs when it comes to the macabre. So, shall we begin!
Kirby: Ye— yes!
Duck: Yeah.
Aubrey: Yeahhh?
Kirby: I don't know if we're supposed to talk. Yeah, go for it.
Ned: I am so excited to have with me here joining me on stage, on scene. I would like my two friends, Duck Newton, to come out, also the magical, mystical Lady Flame. Come out here and take a bow you two!
Aubrey: Okay!
Ned: Duck. C’mon, Duck. [Duck: Yeah…] C'mon, just for a minute. Just c'mon.
Duck: [Unenthusiastic] Hey everybody.
Ned: This is the amazing Lady Flame. Do a trick!
Aubrey: Oh! Um…
Ned: Do some of- don't burn anything down but do a little magic~, why don't you?
Travis: Okay, it’s going to be a really, like, fairly cool sleight of hand, especially with a camera, “Is this your card?” kind of thing. Oh, but at first it's one of those tricks where it's like, “Oh, it seems like she got it wrong,” right, and she's like, “Oh, yeah you’re right,” and then she opens up her jacket and there's a patch of, like, y'know, the three of clubs sewn into the inside. And she's like:
Aubrey: Oh, was this it?
[Gasps]
Ned: Ohohohoho, amazing! Magic like that is a common occurrence here at the Cryptonomica, State Route 16055. Come down and see us. Now, Duck, show them your talking sword trick.
Duck: I don't know what you're talking about, you asked me to come out here and give an announcement about forest safety and I am happy to remind everybody that, after you finish having fun out in the forest, it's great to dump water on your fire. Everybody knows that one, but do give it a good stir around once you dump the water on because sometimes there can be small embers that won't be extinguished, so it is important that you sorta create a dirt slurry. Anyway, yep. So, stay safe out there.
Ned: ..Thank- thank you, Duck. And now you know. And knowing is half the battle! Now you've meet some of the folks here responsible for our fabulous show. Let's get right to some of the thrills and chills. Starring Paul Birch, Lorna Thayer, and Dona Cole, this is The Beast with a Thousand Eyes…
Kirby: A Mil- A Million Eyes!
Ned: What?
Kirby: It’s a Million Eyes.
Ned: That's what I said. Beast with a Million Eyes!
Kirby: You said a thousand- it’s fine. [Shouting] Start the movie!
[Spooky music fades out]
Griffin: We see a prison two counties away. We see a common area. We see a pair of guards watching a small assembly of prisoners who are all seated in front of a small television. And one of the prisoners is holding the remote and flipping through the channels trying to find something for the group to watch. And they flip through some home shopping stuff, they flip through a couple infomercials, Adult Swim, probably. They flip through Saturday Night Live, just scoot right on past that. They flip past Saturday Night Dead, leaving it- lingering on the channel for just a few moments before changing it to another home shopping network special. And a prisoner seated a couple rows back walks up and puts his hand on the prisoner holding the remote. And this prisoner says:
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Prisoner: [Cockney accent] Would you do me a favor and flip back the channel for me?
Griffin: And the other prisoner does and this man laughs and he points at Ned on the television screen and he says:
Prisoner: Heh… I know that bloke."
