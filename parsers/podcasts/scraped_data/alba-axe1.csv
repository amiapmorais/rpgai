"E1: Last Call","INTRODUCTION (ELI)
Oh yes, oh yes, it’s time. Welcome to The Axe & Crown. I’m Eli, creator of Alba Salix, Royal Physician.
If you subscribed a while back, you might be wondering, what is this new show that’s in my Alba Salix podcast feed? Well, this is a new spinoff set in the same world as Alba—actually, just across the river in a slightly more run-down part of town. We’re calling this a mini-series, so it’s six episodes, each about ten, fifteen minutes, rolling out every week from now until early May.
While that’s going on, we’re also working hard on Season Two of Alba, and that, Dear Listener, is why we are asking for your help. As I speak, we’ve just launched an Indiegogo campaign to bring you another season of adventures in fairy-tale medicine with Alba and Magnus and Holly and the gang. The money goes to paying and feeding our actors, plus studio time, production tools, that sort of thing. It’s a lot of work making this show, so please do consider donating a shilling or two and helping spread the word. You can read all about the campaign, watch the video, and see the perks at albasalix.com/season2—link in the show notes.
In the meantime, pull up a bar stool, and enjoy Episode One of The Axe & Crown.
INT. BAR, NIGHE:
A small, hushed crowd of regulars listens to Gubbin deliver a solemn inspirational speech. It soon becomes plain that he is completely sauced, as is his audience.
GUBBIN:
Men… Ladies… strange thing in the corner.
MUSIC: STIRRING WAR-MOVIE SPEECHIFYING STUFF.
GUBBIN:
Tomorrow, we go into battle, side by side, as brothers and sisters. Humans and trolls alike. Some might say we’re just a bunch of sorry-ass losers defending one humble little shack by the river, but it’s more than that. This tavern is home.
ZANE:
Yeah!
GUBBIN:
Tomorrow morning, they’re gonna be at the front door with their swords and their halberds and truncheons. But I’ll tell you this: They can bring the City Guard with them; they can bring every last stinking lawyer from here to hell—they will never, never take the Axe and Crown!
A sustained roar of approval from the crowd. “Gubbin! Gubbin! Gubbin!”
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
And I just want to say—no, no, shut up, you guys. I just want to say… what was I gonna say?
ZANE:
Have another drink, Gubbin!
GUBBIN:
Nah, that wasn’t it. But it’s a damn good idea.
Gubbin fills a tankard from a tap as he continues.
ROSINE:
Yeah, I’ll have one too!
GUBBIN:
Now I remember. I wanted to thank all of you for sticking by me in these difficult times. Serving all of you has been a salve for my wounded heart.
Everybody goes “Aww…”
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
When I started coming here, way back when it was Old Noreena’s place… I was not at my best. And Noreena, she offered me… what’s that thing? That warm, fuzzy kinda emotiony thing—kindness. It’s not something us trolls are too good at accepting. But she wouldn’t say no.
At first it was a place to stay and a bite to eat. Somewhere to have a pint or two with my buddies from the reg. A while later, it was a job pouring the drinks.
ROSINE:
Speaking of drinks—
GUBBIN:
And since she died, great Yulipaa rest her soul, I’ve done my best to carry on her good work, providing rest for the wicked—
The regulars laugh. “Try again, Gubbin!” “Other way around!”
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
…the weary… rest for the weariked… Rest for the wicked and beer for the… thirsty.
ROSINE:
I’m thirsty!
GUBBIN:
Nah, you’re one of the wicked. No beer for you.
Laughter.
ROSINE:
I’m both! Gimme a drink.
Gubbin relents and fills a tankard for her.
GUBBIN:
All right, all right. You’re all friends. And friends stand together. Unlike certain unfaithful, two-timing kitchen staff who shall remain nameless.
Boos from the crowd.
ZANE:
Forget him, Gubbin!
ROSINE:
Cheating bastard!
GUBBIN:
But us… We stand together! Our enemies would tear down this lovely, homely tavern to build their shiny new block of flats and offices for all the better, finer people of this city. All thanks to our landlord.
ROSINE:
Kill all the landlords!
The crowd roars.
GUBBIN:
Carlton Gerrard Esquire, that eminent profiteering devil-humper—sorry, that’s “property developer”. Heh heh. So ladies, gents, thing in the corner, join me in raising one final toast to Mister Carlton Gerrard, may he die of the purple cramps and his teeth be used to scrape poop off the floor of a barn.
They all cheer. Tankards clink. Gubbin drains half his beer.
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
Ahh. And with that profound senter—that profound sentiment—I bid you… a fond goodnight.
He falls over and his tankard goes rolling. The crowd cheers louder.
MUSIC: OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode One: Last Call.
INT. BAR, MORNINE:
Snoring from several people, including Gubbin. There’s a knock at the heavy wooden door.
GUBBIN:
(half asleep)
Who’s walkin’ over my bridge…
The knocking comes louder.
STAN:
(from outside)
Hello? Anybody home?
Another knock.
GUBBIN:
(suddenly alert, hisses)
What’s that?
ZANE:
There’s a guy outside with some papers. That him?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. It’s him. They’re here. Everybody! On your feet!
The regulars rise. Hungover groans.
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
C’mon. Swords out!
ROSINE:
Too bad we don’t have any boiling oil.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, well.
ROSINE:
I tell ya, Gubbin, if you’d just let us in the kitchen—
GUBBIN:
Nobody goes in the kitchen.
ROSINE:
I know, I know. Just saying.
ZANE:
It’s true, though. Woulda been nice to have a hot meal here and there while we’re on lockdown.
GUBBIN:
Will you guys shut it?
Stan taps at the window.
STAN:
Anybody there? Your front door seems to be stuck.
Gubbin opens the window.
GUBBIN:
Carlton Gerrard.
STAN:
Hey, good morning! Are you Mister, uh, Gubbin?
GUBBIN:
Carlton Gerrard, prepare to meet thy doom.
STAN:
No, no, no! I’m not Carlton Gerrard. I’m his son.
GUBBIN:
Aha!
STAN:
My name’s Stan. Stanway Gerrard. Nice to meet you.
(beat)
Can I come in?
GUBBIN:
Nice try. Tell all your men to stand down.
STAN:
Sorry… my men?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Where are they hiding?
STAN:
I don’t have any men.
GUBBIN:
Yeah! That’s weird. Where is everybody?
ROSINE:
(whispering)
They gotta be hidden somewhere.
STAN:
So, uh… what do you say?
GUBBIN:
No. You run along home and tell your daddy he can go find some other place to knock down.
STAN:
Yeah, you know, that’s very funny.
GUBBIN:
Tell him the Axe and Crown is staying right where it is!
The regulars cheer, then quickly realize how hungover they are and trail off in a chorus of “Ow!” and “Shhh!”
STAN:
My father is dead.
GUBBIN:
He’s what?
STAN:
He died. A week ago.
Whispers: “What did he say?” “Who’s dead?”
GUBBIN:
Says who?
STAN:
It was in all the papers… How did you not hear about it?
GUBBIN:
We’re on lockdown. Nobody gets in or out.
STAN:
Oh. Is that why all these newspapers are piled up on your doorstep?
He bends over and looks through the pile.
GUBBIN:
Don’t try anything funny.
STAN:
Look. It’s right here.
GUBBIN:
(squinting, reads)
“Building Boom: Real Estate Magnate… Explodes”?
STAN:
Yeah. Some kind of magical accident, apparently. He bought some bogus crystal and tried to cast a spell with it.
GUBBIN:
“Royal Doc Chalks Up Pox To Magic Rocks.” Huh. Well. That’s too bad.
STAN:
I know he wasn’t the most popular person around here…
GUBBIN:
Nah, we’re big fans.
STAN:
Anyway, long story short, I kinda own your building now!
GUBBIN:
Is that so.
STAN:
So, do you want to maybe let me in, and we can talk about our plans for this place?
GUBBIN:
What is he up to?
ROSINE:
It’s gotta be some kind of trick. Street looks clear, though. I don’t see anyone on the rooftops.
GUBBIN:
(calls)
Anyone out back?
ZANE:
Negative.
GUBBIN:
Hmm.
STAN:
Hello?
GUBBIN:
All right. Let’s open ‘er up.
They shove the furniture aside, then unbolt and open the front door. Stan strolls in.
STAN:
Hey everybody! Geez, pretty big crowd for nine in the morning.
The door slams shut behind him.
GUBBIN:
Stan, right?
STAN:
That’s me.
GUBBIN:
Stan, I’d like you to meet my loyal patrons and tenants. Everybody, this is the Axe and Crown’s new landlord, Stan.
Blades are drawn. Sinister chuckles.
STAN:
Hi there!
ROSINE:
Kill all the landlords!
The rest give a lusty shout, followed by more shushing and groaning.
GUBBIN:
So let’s hear all about these plans of yours.
STAN:
Well. As you probably know, my father’s plan was to evict everyone and knock down the building.
Hisses and boos.
STAN (CONT’D)
But! But I’m not going to do that.
GUBBIN:
Oh no?
Stan unfurls a set of blueprints.
STAN:
Yeah, look! I had my guy do up new plans. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you… the Prospect Hotel!
This does not get the expected rousing cheer.
GUBBIN:
What the hell is this?
STAN:
See, we keep the original building and extend it. Three more storeys on top, with a swimming pool, one of those cool terraces right here…
GUBBIN:
And you think this is gonna stay standing.
STAN:
How do you mean?
GUBBIN:
That much weight on the foundation? It’s gonna be another Leaning Tavern of Paramecia.
STAN:
Another what?
GUBBIN:
Some duke decided he was gonna build the biggest, most amazing hotel in the world. Eight storeys, terraces everywhere, cute little mini palm trees on the roof. Won all kinds of architecture awards before it was even built. But he put it right on the riverbank, on crappy soil.
STAN:
And it started leaning?
GUBBIN:
Yup, then it leaned some more. And then, opening night, it tilted right over and fell in the river.
STAN:
Oh.
GUBBIN:
Which is exactly what you’ll get if you build this.
STAN:
Couldn’t we just shore it up? With shoring? Or, like, you know… buttresses?
GUBBIN:
Who did these plans?
STAN:
Buddy of mine. He’s really good. Studying to be an architect.
GUBBIN:
Oh, of course. Frickin’ architects. No, you can’t “just shore it up”.
STAN:
Could we maybe lose some of the additional stories?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Try all of them.
STAN:
Really? Well… I guess we can keep the luxury suites on the existing floors.
GUBBIN:
And where would my tenants go?
STAN:
They would, uh, find temporary lodgings somewhere else and then move back in.
GUBBIN:
Same rent as before?
STAN:
Well, you know, it might go up somewhat.
The crowd is restless. “Somewhat!”
GUBBIN:
Why here? Why don’t you build your fancy hotel downtown, where people can afford it?
STAN:
Look, downtown Grandville’s getting expensive these days. People are starting to look at places further out. Like Mud Street here! What a great street!
GUBBIN:
Uh huh? So why don’t you tell me what’s so great about Mud Street?
STAN:
It’s honest. Down to earth. You know. It’s a place for all the little people.
GUBBIN:
Little people. So what are we, pixies now?
STAN:
No, no, I don’t mean you’re actually little. Heh, certainly not you, you big ol’ troll, you.
GUBBIN:
So just small in the metaphorical sense. Petty, unimportant.
STAN:
Uh…
GUBBIN:
Never mind. You were talking about Mud Street.
STAN:
Mud Street! Is a street that’s muddy, because it’s by the river… and it’s of the river… Heh, when it rains I bet it pretty much is the river
(laughs nervously)
This falls flat too.
GUBBIN:
Uh huh.
STAN:
And like a river, it bends and flows, and it’s full of life, like the way a river is alive with fish and crawdads and bugs…
GUBBIN:
Ah, I get it. So we’re not just little, we’re actually bugs.
STAN:
Yeah. No! That’s not what I—
Rosina and the others start to pull out knives and swords.
ROSINE:
You want me to cut him down the middle, boss?
STAN:
Whoa! Hey! No cutting! No cutting! Look, you guys… this place is what it is because of you! Good, hard-workin’ honest townsfolk. Folks with heart, and soul, and… big pointy knives.
GUBBIN:
Okay, let me ask you again. Isn’t there some other neighbourhood you can think of to inflict your hotel on? Somewhere with solid ground? Somewhere that’s not here?
STAN:
I would, but, well… this is the only property I got.
GUBBIN:
Give me a break. Your daddy owned half the buildings downtown.
STAN:
Those went to other members of the family.
GUBBIN:
Ahhh. I get it. Poor little Stan, not exactly the favourite son, huh?
The crowd joins him in a sarcastic “Awww.”
STAN:
Hey now. That’s not fair.
GUBBIN:
Well, Stan, let me introduce you to some of my good, hard-working, honest regulars. This is Zane. He spent seven years in prison for robbery and assault.
ZANE:
How ya doin’.
STAN:
Fine?
Everyone leans in. A soft but growing murmur of sadistic chuckles.
GUBBIN:
Doctor Hankenberg there, he’s what you might call a poison specialist. And I don’t mean antidotes. Rosina, well, they got her for conspiracy to murder. Woulda hanged her but she escaped. After she slit her executioner’s throat.
STAN:
Oh! Well. Wow. Still! That doesn’t mean you’re not all good people, you know, like, deep down…
GUBBIN:
Eh. I bet the town guard would beg to differ.
STAN:
Is everybody here a criminal or a murderer?
A tense silence—then Gubbin and everyone else bursts into mocking laughter.
GUBBIN:
Naw. I’m just messin’ with you, kid.
STAN:
What! Really? Aw, you guys! You had me going there.
GUBBIN:
Rosina’s a baker. Hank works down at the docks. Zane’s got a little flower stall. He sells pansies
(laughs)
STAN:
That’s nice!
GUBBIN:
(suddenly close)
But I wouldn’t get them mad, if I was you.
STAN:
No, sir.
GUBBIN:
Some of them live here, some of them just come by for a pint and a bit of company. I just wanted you to see their faces. Realize these are real people you’re kicking out.
STAN:
I’m not kicking anybody out!
A few skeptical snorts.
GUBBIN:
You think these folks can afford your rent hike?
A moment passes.
STAN:
No, I’m not hiking the rent either.
You’re right, I was never my parents’ favourite. I was no good at business, I was no good at selling things, or bargaining. That’s why they left everything to my sister.
So you guys… you should count yourselves lucky. You’re standing up for each other. You’re more of a family to each other than I had growing up.
I think you are good people. With a hilarious sense of humour! I can’t just go and kick you guys out.
So… the heck with these plans! The redevelopment is hereby cancelled.
Stan tears the blueprints in half. Gasps. The crowd is finally warming to him.
GUBBIN:
We got your word on that?
STAN:
Absolutely. The Prospect Hotel is dead. Long live the Axe and Crown!
A cheer goes up. This time, no one groans.
GUBBIN:
All right. Good man.
STAN:
Yeah! Put ‘er there.
They shake hands.
STAN (CONT’D)
Oooh. Ow. That’s a firm handshake.
GUBBIN:
These people are trusting in you, pal. You go back on your word and all these good, honest townsfolk will tear your face off.
STAN:
You really mean it?
GUBBIN:
Course I mean it.
STAN:
Woo hoo! We’re pals now!
GUBBIN:
Wha? No, I meant—
STAN:
This is gonna be amazing. I always wanted to run a bar!
GUBBIN:
Now wait a second. I run the bar.
STAN:
Best inheritance ever! Look at this place! Think of the possibilities
(backtracking)
…for small and tasteful changes! Eh, pal?
GUBBIN:
Crap on a stick.
STAN:
What do you say, folks? First round’s on me!
The patrons cheer.

"E2: Small Change","INTRODUCTION (ELI)
Hi everyone. Eli here. Just a reminder that our fundraiser for Alba Salix Season Two is still on. You can donate at albasalix.com.
This week’s episode is dedicated to the memory of Mr Bill Hollweg. I’ll be back after the show to tell you more about him.
MUSIC—OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Two: Small Change.
INT. BAR, MORNINE:
The bar is empty except for Gubbin and Stan.
STAN:
Psst! Hey Gubbin! You awake there? You look like you had a rough night.
GUBBIN:
Is it morning?
STAN:
Bright and not-so-early. Did you actually fall asleep at the bar?
GUBBIN:
Who are you again?
STAN:
I’m Stan
Your new landlord?
GUBBIN:
Oh no.
STAN:
Yeah! Remember yesterday? With the swords and everything? You guys really had me going there. And then after that—oh man, what a party. All those drinking games, and Pin the Tail on the Landlord! That was a riot. Slightly painful, still a riot.
GUBBIN:
Mmnh.
STAN:
Your patrons, Gubbin, they just kill me.
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Tell ’em to hurry up with that, okay?
STAN:
So anyways, listen. I got one word for you.
GUBBIN:
Yeah. What.
STAN:
Patio.
GUBBIN:
Huh?
STAN:
Pa-ti‑o.
GUBBIN:
That’s three.
STAN:
Three what?
GUBBIN:
Three words.
STAN:
No, one word. Three syllables.
GUBBIN:
Make sense, man.
STAN:
Syllables. They’re like words, only shorter.
GUBBIN:
Right. Okay. Good idea. Stick with those.
STAN:
So yeah. Patio! We should have one!
GUBBIN:
We who?
STAN:
Whee hoo!
GUBBIN:
Stop that. Who’s “we?”
STAN:
Us! Partners, remember?
GUBBIN:
I do not.
STAN:
You run the bar, I own the building, that kinda makes us partners, yeah?
GUBBIN:
That makes you the landlord, and me the guy that runs the bar.
STAN:
This is so cool! I have always wanted to have a tavern. A beacon for the weary traveler. A place where friends meet and greet. Where good times are had and spirits run high. A place with a patio!
GUBBIN:
There’s that word again.
STAN:
Yeah. They got one at this swanky coffee shop on the other side of the big bridge. It’s on the the edge of the market square, so you can have some lemon seed cake and espresso while you watch the world go by…
GUBBIN:
So let’s put in a patio here, so everyone can, what, gaze at the beautiful cracks and stains on the wall across the street?
STAN:
You could probably put up plants and things, some nice flowers. I don’t think the lemon seed cake is a must, but man, the espresso…
GUBBIN:
Stan.
STAN:
Gubbin!
GUBBIN:
Do you know where the name Mud Street comes from?
STAN:
Totally. Yes, I do. It’s ’cause of the mud, right? Or is there some secret meaning? Does it stand for… Magnificent Urban Destination?
GUBBIN:
It’s because of the mud.
STAN:
I knew it!
GUBBIN:
How would you describe the smell of the mud in Mud Street?
STAN:
Oh, okay. Uh, it’s kind of an earthy… it’s a rich, intricate aroma, it’s dark, with a strong note of…
GUBBIN:
Poop.
STAN:
Yeah, poop.
GUBBIN:
That go well with lemon seed cake?
STAN:
Okay, thinking, no, not exactly. Okay, I’m hearing you, no patio, I get that. Heck with the patio. Here’s one for ya, you ready? Theme nights.
GUBBIN:
Don’t you have a job or something? Somewhere you have to be?
STAN:
Lemme see, next on the list…
GUBBIN:
What’s this list?
STAN:
Of improvements. To the Axe and Crown. Ready?
GUBBIN:
Why does the Axe and Crown need improving?
STAN:
Number one: the beds. Gotta say, I crashed in a vacant room last night and when I woke up, man, I hurt all over.
GUBBIN:
That’s what you get for playing Pin The Tail On The Landlord. Boy, did you squeal!
STAN:
Well, that might be a factor, I get it. But we really do need new bedding.
GUBBIN:
The bedding is new.
STAN:
It’s like straw.
GUBBIN:
It is straw. It’s new straw.
STAN:
We could switch to down, or wool or something.
GUBBIN:
Sure. Let’s do that for all our luxury suites.
STAN:
Hold on! Which ones are the luxury suites?
GUBBIN:
None of them. None of them are luxury suites.
STAN:
Wouldn’t that be a great idea though? You’d get premium rents… I have to add that to the list.
He scribbles on his paper.
GUBBIN:
Once again, I think you’re forgetting what neighbourhood you’re in.
STAN:
Okay. Here’s another idea—small effort, big impact. Clean the windows!
GUBBIN:
Why?
STAN:
It’s so dark in here.
GUBBIN:
That’s the idea. It’s a tavern. It’s dark. How else am I supposed to sleep?
STAN:
We’ll put up curtains.
GUBBIN:
Curtains get dusty.
STAN:
And windows get dirty. We can hire someone to clean them both.
GUBBIN:
You said you liked the Axe and Crown for its authenticity.
STAN:
Absolutely!
GUBBIN:
How’s that fit with changing everything in it?
STAN:
Seriously? Curtains are gonna ruin the authenticity?
GUBBIN:
Next you’re gonna say change the name.
STAN:
Well…
GUBBIN:
(sighs)
STAN:
It’s just… you know, a little militaristic.
GUBBIN:
What was your first clue? The fact our sign is a shield with a weapon painted on it?
STAN:
Yeah, but… “The Axe and Crown”. Not really very comfy or welcoming.
GUBBIN:
As opposed to what?
STAN:
I dunno, the Rover’s Roost. Or The Ship and the Anchor.
GUBBIN:
You gotta be kidding.
STAN:
Well, no that’s got some seafaring kinda deal to it… “arrrr!” Wait! How about this: “The Troll’s Den”.
GUBBIN:
I’m a troll! I’m not a bear!
STAN:
“The Troll’s Treasure”.
GUBBIN:
Trolls don’t do treasure. That’s leprechauns.
STAN:
Right! Hold on! The treasure… is your tavern. Your patrons!
GUBBIN:
Why do you want to change the name?
STAN:
Well, the sign’s falling to bits… it seems, you know, like a good moment to start fresh. I know a couple of sign painters who used to work for my father. I’ll bet they could do an awesome new sign for you. What do you think?
GUBBIN:
You know where the name “Axe and Crown” comes from?
STAN:
No! Enlighten me.
GUBBIN:
It’s from the arms of our regiment. Second Royal Engineering Battalion.
STAN:
You were in the army? Like, our army? I didn’t think they had any trolls.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, a few. Mostly doing the dangerous stuff. You wanted something built or blown up or booby trapped, the Second, we were your go-to team.
STAN:
Wait, the Second? The Battle of Whipsaw Gap? That was you guys?
GUBBIN:
You’ve heard of it.
STAN:
Yeah, I mean I was just little when it happened, but… oh man. You guys are kinda like heroes.
GUBBIN:
Eh. Well. We got sent in to do a job. We did it.
STAN:
Still.
GUBBIN:
Anyway, look. Old Noreena ran this place before me. Her brother was in the Second with us. After the war, the old gang used to come around here, have a pint, help her out. She’s the one called it the Axe and Crown.
STAN:
Ah. Okay. Gotcha.
GUBBIN:
So the name stays.
STAN:
Oh no, yes, definitely. Axe and Crown all the way.
GUBBIN:
Mm hmm.
An awkward pause. Stan looks around for something else to talk about.
STAN:
So! Uh, so this, this over here must be the bar.
GUBBIN:
No, it’s a wall that’s lying down on the job. Don’t touch those.
STAN:
I always thought I’d make a great bartender. “Here you go, my friend. That’ll be three shillings and sixpence.”
GUBBIN:
Three and six! What kind of place do you think I’m running?
Stan wanders around the room and tries the kitchen door. It’s locked.
STAN:
Ahh, I love it! What’s in here? The kitchen?
GUBBIN:
(sharply)
Don’t. Kitchen’s off limits.
STAN:
Why, what’s in there?
GUBBIN:
It’s been condemned. We had a fire.
STAN:
Oh no! How bad is it?
GUBBIN:
You don’t want to know.
STAN:
Well, we need to fix it up right away! Start serving food again.
GUBBIN:
I’m running the bar. I don’t have time to cook.
STAN:
Okay, so we get a cook.
GUBBIN:
I had one.
STAN:
And?
GUBBIN:
He… left.
STAN:
So we get another!
GUBBIN:
I’m not paying more damn people.
STAN:
Hey! We could have some kind of signature dish. Whaddya think? Something unique that says “Axe and Crown”.
GUBBIN:
What, like field rations?
STAN:
Yeah! Now you’re talking. Are those good?
Stan ducks through another doorway.
STAN (CONT’D)
Aw, Gubbin, I love this back room! You know what it needs? A stage along the far wall…
GUBBIN:
Stage!
STAN:
Yeah! This place would make a great music venue.
GUBBIN:
No. No musicians. Not since that guy with the whistle.
Stan returns to the bar.
STAN:
What guy? Guy with a whistle?
GUBBIN:
Some guy said he could charm all the cockroaches in the building and lead ’em away. Played this whistle was supposed to sound exactly like a cockroach mating call.
STAN:
But it didn’t?
GUBBIN:
Oh, it did. He had the mating call down to a T. Then he joined a poker game, got caught cheating and ran off before he could get to the “leading them away” part. So what do you think we ended up with?
STAN:
More cockroaches?
GUBBIN:
Ten times more cockroaches. And an earache.
STAN:
Never mind that. Listen, some buddies of mine are in a band. They play jigs and country dances, really great tunes.
GUBBIN:
Spare me. I can’t stand all that fol-de-doy hiddledy-day stuff.
STAN:
That’s the best part!
GUBBIN:
Those aren’t words. That’s just making sounds.
STAN:
Yeah, sounds have no place in music.
GUBBIN:
Who wants to listen to music when they’re trying to have a beer?
STAN:
The Broken Bell, up by the College, they’ve got music every night. People love it. The bartenders there are busy from sundown till last call!
GUBBIN:
I got enough things to take care of without having to serve a hundred beers in a night.
STAN:
You won’t need to! If we start bringing in those kind of crowds, we can afford to hire more staff.
GUBBIN:
(muttering)
Musicians, man…
STAN:
We can start doing shows one or two nights a week…
GUBBIN:
NO MUSIC.
STAN:
Poetry? Maybe? The Broken Bell—
GUBBIN:
The Broken Bell can keep all their damn music and poetry. It ain’t coming in here!
STAN:
No romantic spirit, that’s your problem!
GUBBIN:
None whatsoever.
STAN:
Gubbin, there must be something you want to do with this place. If you could change just one thing about this bar, what would it be?
GUBBIN:
Just one thing?
STAN:
Yeah!
GUBBIN:
Let me think. Wait, I got it.
STAN:
Yeah? What?
Gubbin rises and grabs Stan by the collar.
STAN (CONT’D)
Hey, hey! This is my good coat.
GUBBIN:
Oh! You are a little fella.
Gubbin force-marches Stan to the door.
STAN:
Listen, what about upstairs? You could renovate the rooms, make ’em nice and—aaack!
Gubbin tosses Stan out and slams the door behind him.
GUBBIN:
(sighs)
Yeah. Much better.
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR, EVENINE:
Moderate crowd.
GUBBIN:
You want a refill there, Rosina?
ROSINE:
Sure. I like the new curtains, by the way.
GUBBIN:
Really?
He pours her a beer.
ROSINE:
Yeah, they give this room a cozy kinda feeling. It’s nice.
GUBBIN:
If you say so. There you are.
ROSINE:
Thanks, Gubbin.
Rosina heads back to the far corner.
STAN:
See? Everyone likes the curtains.
GUBBIN:
Three people doesn’t equal “everyone”.
STAN:
Hey. Have you heard anyone say they don’t like them?
GUBBIN:
Fine. Your curtains can stay.
STAN:
Woo hoo!
GUBBIN:
Stop that. Especially since the windows are all clear now.
STAN:
Heaven forbid. You might actually be able to see what’s outside.
ROSINE:
(from afar)
Hey Stan! Tommy doesn’t believe you can fit a hundred and forty peanuts in your mouth.
GUBBIN:
Sounds like your services are required, Stan.
ROSINE:
Hey Stan!
STAN:
Be right there!
(to Gubbin)
You like the curtains, just wait till you see the new sign.
GUBBIN:
Hang on. What new sign?
STAN:
It’s already up!
GUBBIN:
There better not be a ship on it!
STAN:
Okay, guys. I’m ready!
He heads off. Excited shouts from Rosina and company. They start counting: “One! Two! Three!” and continue throughout.
Gubbin pulls the curtain.
GUBBIN:
(under his breath)
I don’t believe it. Stan, you little bastard.
The outside door opens and several musicians enter.
LUCKE:
…yeah, everybody said it was a dump, but Rosie told me they finally started fixing the place up a bit. Hey! You Gubbin?
GUBBIN:
That’s me.
LUCKE:
Nice to meet ya. I’m Lucky. That a new sign out front? Looks good.
GUBBIN:
Yeah. It’s not bad. Hell… it’s kinda beautiful.
LUCKE:
“The Axe and Crown”. That got anything to do with the old Second Engineers?
GUBBIN:
Yeah, sure does.
LUCKE:
Heroes, man. I grew up in Little Moose Valley. Mom and Dad always said those guys literally saved our town.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, they did okay. So. What can I get you folks?
LUCKE:
Ale for me. You guys?
His bandmates agree. “Absolutely.” “Ale for me too.”
LUCKY (CONT’D)
Four ales, if you please!
Gubbin starts pouring.
GUBBIN:
Comin’ up. You from out of town?
LUCKE:
Hmm? Oh, the cases? Nah, these are our instruments. We’re the band!
Gubbin stops pouring.
GUBBIN:
The band…
LUCKE:
Yeah, didn’t your guy Stan tell you? We’re playing tonight. We’re called the Retching Rogues.
GUBBIN:
You’re musicians.
LUCKE:
That’s right!
They retch.
GUBBIN:
STAN!
The crowd stops counting; sounds of disappointment. A hush falls.
STAN:
(approaching, mouth full)
Yes, Gubbin?
GUBBIN:
(beat)
Show these rogues to the back room and help ’em set up.
STAN:
You got it, boss.

Hi, it’s Eli, writer and co-producer here.
This week, we had some sad news in the little community of indie audio drama. Bill Hollweg, who must have worked on about a million productions for Darker Projects and Broken Sea Audio, has died, and far too soon. He was a real pioneer in online audio drama, and someone with boundless enthusiasm, always a kind word and encouragement for others. I never met the man in person, but I’m really grateful for all he did for us. So here’s to you, Bill. Godspeed."
"E3: Trølsig for Beginners","INTRODUCTION (SEAN)
Hi, Sean here, co-producer of Alba Salix and The Axe & Crown, and we’re bringing you Episode 3 of The Axe & Crown right now. But stick around after, because I have a really special announcement.
MUSIC—OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Three: Trølsig for Beginners.
INT. BAR, NIGHE:
STAN:
Hey Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
Yeah.
STAN:
Teach me how to say something in troll.
GUBBIN:
In “troll”.
STAN:
Yeah.
GUBBIN:
I assume you mean Trølsig.
STAN:
Yeah, that’s what I said. You’re a troll, right?
GUBBIN:
You trying to be funny?
STAN:
C’mon. Teach me something in “Trollsig”. How do you say “hello”?
GUBBIN:
You don’t.
STAN:
Aw, c’mon, Gub.
GUBBIN:
There’s no such word in high Trølsig.
STAN:
There’s gotta be.
GUBBIN:
Doesn’t exist.
STAN:
Well, what do you say, then?
GUBBIN:
Nothing. You just talk. ‘S how trolls are.
STAN:
No hello, you just start talking?
GUBBIN:
Or not. You got nothing to say, you say nothing. It’s better that way. Why the sudden interest?
STAN:
Just curious.
GUBBIN:
Uh huh?
STAN:
Y’know, like… Well, say I was to meet, I dunno, like a lady troll.
GUBBIN:
So that’s what this is about.
STAN:
No, no, not like that. Okay, like that.
GUBBIN:
You could not handle a troll.
STAN:
Gubbin, you underestimate me. Sure, I’m not exactly a side o’ beef…
GUBBIN:
You’d snap like a twig!
STAN:
It’s just, I gotta tell you…
GUBBIN:
You and a troll!
STAN:
I know. Here’s the thing. Things are a little… quiet on the romantic side…
GUBBIN:
So you scared off the entire human population?
STAN:
I’m just thinking, you know, maybe I should cast the net a little wider.
GUBBIN:
Trolls, though?
STAN:
Yeah!
GUBBIN:
Start small. Like, a pixie, man!
STAN:
Look. Troll women are solid, and forthright, and hard-working. They’re not flimsy and flighty like human girls.
GUBBIN:
You ever actually met a troll woman?
STAN:
Oh yeah, I mean, yes! I’ve totally… seen… one.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, see, Farloria’s not exactly a hot destination for trolls.
STAN:
Yeah, why is that, anyway?
GUBBIN:
Dunno. Could be folks down around here don’t seem to like us very much.
STAN:
I like trolls.
GUBBIN:
Well, unfortunately for you, there is no eligible troll woman in this town.
STAN:
Unfortunately for me! What about you?
GUBBIN:
I deal.
STAN:
What if one did come to town?
GUBBIN:
Come to this town, she’d have to be dumb as a plank.
STAN:
I dunno, you might change your tune if you met her…
GUBBIN:
Met who?
STAN:
No one. Just a hypothetical troll lady.
GUBBIN:
Well, maybe if you close your eyes and pray real hard to Hönsflär.
STAN:
Pray to who?
GUBBIN:
Hönsflär Nüuki, the love goddess.
STAN:
Would that work?
GUBBIN:
You can try.
STAN:
Okay. So say I did that, and I happened to meet a troll of the female persuasion. What would I say to her?
GUBBIN:
What would you say? Mm, probably “Oh, hi there, pretty lady! No, put me down! Help! Gaaagk!”
(he mimics squishing noises)
STAN:
Hilarious.
GUBBIN:
That’s you getting squished like a little bug in the ground.
STAN:
Yeah, I got that part. That is hilarious.
GUBBIN:
By a pretty troll lady.
STAN:
Clever. Yeah.
GUBBIN:
Oops! Gonna need a mop now.
STAN:
Why you so down on troll-human romance, Gub?
GUBBIN:
Dunno. Maybe I’m just skeptical of humans that think that they’re into trolls.
STAN:
Well, ouch. Waaait. Something happened, didn’t it? You had your heart broken!
(beat)
Yeah, see? Your stony silence speaks volumes.
GUBBIN:
If I say nothing, it’s ’cause I got nothing to say.
STAN:
You were in love with a human lady.
GUBBIN:
I was not, actually.
STAN:
Yes, you were. Look at you. So, was she pretty? Was she? What was her name?
GUBBIN:
Give it up, Stan.
STAN:
What was her name?
GUBBIN:
(snaps)
Johann.
STAN:
Yeah, very funny.
(beat)
Wait, what? Really?
GUBBIN:
I’m about done talking.
STAN:
I was right though, wasn’t I? Did he break your heart?
GUBBIN:
Eh.
STAN:
Wow. You and a human dude.
GUBBIN:
You done?
STAN:
I’m just trying to picture it.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, well, look. You keep picturing out loud, I might have to put your head through the top of this bar. So I suggest you change the subject.
STAN:
Okay. How about just teaching me some troll? Sig? Trollsig?
GUBBIN:
Fine. Stan, if you ever meet a troll woman, and she doesn’t beat you into porridge, I’ll teach you some Trølsig.
STAN:
Really?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Sure.
STAN:
Aw. You’re a pal.
GUBBIN:
I am not your pal.
STAN:
You’re my pal, Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
No.
STAN:
You are, and you’re gonna teach me high Trollski. ‘Cause I just met one.
GUBBIN:
What!
STAN:
Yeah, on the way here tonight! She was getting off a ship down at the quay.
GUBBIN:
A troll, here in town?
STAN:
Yeah.
GUBBIN:
What did she look like?
STAN:
Uh, tall. Wide. Broad. Wait, is broad this way or this way?
GUBBIN:
Blue or grey?
STAN:
Sort of a bluey grey? Well, same colour as you, pretty much.
GUBBIN:
Northerner, then.
STAN:
Someone you know?
GUBBIN:
Hard to say. Did you get her name?
STAN:
No, I don’t speak troll! But here’s the thing: I overheard her asking for directions to the Lower Bank. She could be coming here!
GUBBIN:
Thought you didn’t speak troll.
STAN:
Well, no, she was speaking… I guess I could have asked her name, eh.
GUBBIN:
Ah, well, light goes on finally, huh?
The outside door opens.
STAN:
By all the gods.
GUBBIN:
Oh no. This is your mystery troll woman?
STAN:
Yes!
(whispers)
Thank you, Hensflar Nuxie!
GUBBIN:
What the hell is she doing here?
Betula shuts the door and hauls her trunk over.
STAN:
Quick, Gubbin, how do I say, uh… “You are a queen among women”?
GUBBIN:
Oh, kid, you don’t know what you’re getting into.
STAN:
(clears his throat)
Welcome, madame, to the Axe and Crown! My name’s Stan, and may I introduce my friend Gubbin, the proprietor…
BETULE:
I know who he is. Vell, Onkel? Seyen summat. (“Well, Uncle? Say something.”)
STAN:
Sorry—Uncle?
GUBBIN:
Anna Betula. Vat in alfa hels yu is du heer? (“What the hell are you doing here?”)
BETULE:
Guten seen yu also. (“Oh, nice to see you too.”)
STAN:
Wait! Is this Trollsig? What does it mean?
BETULE:
Thess vierd vee mannen, hu is? (“Who’s this weird little man?”)
GUBBIN:
Don’t ask.
STAN:
Hi! My name’s Stan. I own the building.
BETULE:
Ah. Nice to meet you. I’m Betula.
STAN:
Betula! So what brings you to town?
BETULE:
I was just passing through and thought I’d say hello.
STAN:
Aha! I knew it.
BETULE:
What?
STAN:
Gubbin…
GUBBIN:
What?
STAN:
Trolls do so say hello.
GUBBIN:
(sighs)
BETULE:
Yeah. Just heading up along the coast, and thought I’d stop by and see my good old uncle…
GUBBIN:
Ha. That’s nice. Well, been good seeing you.
BETULE:
Oh, come on. I thought I’d stay the night at least.
GUBBIN:
There’s a couple places a bit further down the riverside that might have rooms for cheap.
BETULE:
What about here? You don’t have a room for your favourite niece?
STAN:
Yeah, Gubbin. Don’t you have a—
GUBBIN:
No vacancies.
BETULE:
Come on. What’s the problem? Is this because of that whole thing between you and Mama?
GUBBIN:
Nah, what are you talking about? We’re just full up.
STAN:
We’ve got loads of vacancies, Gubbin. You want your favourite niece to have to sleep under a bridge or something?
GUBBIN:
Oh, you didn’t go there.
STAN:
Oh, sorry, I totally didn’t mean… ’cause you’re a troll and… bridges… oh man.
BETULE:
It’s fine. Really. It’s okay. Uncle, do you have a room for me or not?
GUBBIN:
(considers)
Cash up front.
STAN:
Gubbin…
BETULE:
No, it’s fine. Here.
She slides a coin across the bar.
GUBBIN:
That’s Mellurian money.
BETULE:
I know.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, well, dunno if you noticed, but this ain’t Melluria.
BETULE:
I just got off a boat. I haven’t had time to change my money.
STAN:
I will take care of it! I can change it when I’m at the bank tomorrow.
BETULE:
Yeah, see?
GUBBIN:
Fine. Here.
He gives Stan the coin and turns away to fetch a key.
STAN:
If you like, I can take the rest of your cash too.
BETULE:
No! No, that’s fine.
STAN:
You sure? I’m a customer there. I get a preferred rate…
BETULE:
I can do it myself.
STAN:
Okay. But for sure don’t take it to those jerks by the market. They’ll totally rip you off. Always go to the bank.
BETULE:
Sure…
GUBBIN:
Here’s your key. Top floor, first door on the right.
STAN:
Top floor? Why don’t we give her one of the renovated rooms?
(to Betula)
I finally talked Gubbin into fixing up some of the rooms here. Most of them didn’t even have beds!
GUBBIN:
Fine. Here. Second floor at the end.
He hands her a different key.
BETULE:
Tanke heeps, Onkel.
GUBBIN:
Ya, vatevs.
She hefts her trunk and makes for the stairs.
STAN:
Oh, let me help you with your trunk, too! Just gimme a second.
(softly)
Hey, Gubbin…!
GUBBIN:
What.
STAN:
You promised… Teach me a couple words in troll. C’mon. Just a couple.
GUBBIN:
Uh. Vel tyervet.
STAN:
Vel… what?
GUBBIN:
“Vel tyervet.” Means welcome.
STAN:
Nice!
(he saunters over)
Hey, Betula! I just wanted to say… vel chervit!
BETULE:
Oh! Uh, tanke müklet. You speak Trølsig?
STAN:
Not really. But I’m learning!
BETULE:
(amused)
That’s very… strange of you.
STAN:
Oh, it’s nothing.
BETULE:
And your accent is terrible.
STAN:
I know, right? Maybe you can help me!
BETULE:
Right. Okay. Sure.
STAN:
And hey, if you want, I can show you around Grandville! ‘Cause not only am I the owner here, I’m also the Axe and Crown’s official tour guide.
GUBBIN:
(aside)
No. No.
BETULE:
Really.
STAN:
Yup! There’s lots to see here. Great markets, classic Farlorian architecture… oh, and there’s a brand new art gallery too! Do you like art?
BETULE:
(suddenly icy)
Why do you ask?
STAN:
I dunno, I thought you might be interested in doing something cultural—
His words are choked off as Betula grabs him.
BETULE:
Who sent you?
STAN:
(strangled)
Sent me…?
BETULE:
Was it Arvando? What do you know about art?
STAN:
I don’t know much about art. Do you not like art?
BETULE:
You’re not with the Bassis?
STAN:
What’s a Bassi? May I please be allowed to breathe? Please and thank you?
Betula lets go. Stan wheezes.
BETULE:
You don’t know Arvando Bassi?
STAN:
No… Should I?
BETULE:
Never mind.
STAN:
Okay. So no gallery then, that’s cool. Uhh… do you like music?
BETULE:
Sorry about that. I thought you were someone else.
STAN:
Nope, just me. Hi!
BETULE:
Good. That’s very good. Hi.
(beat)
I’m gonna take my trunk upstairs now.
Betula hefts her trunk again. Her heavy footsteps ascend the creaky stairs.
STAN:
Sure! Can I help you with that…? Uh… no, I guess you’ve got that. Wow. Okay.
BETULE:
Good night, Stan.
STAN:
Good night, Betula!
GUBBIN:
(cackling)
Smooth move, Stan.
STAN:
What?
GUBBIN:
Did I call it or did I call it?
STAN:
Call what?
GUBBIN:
She just about snapped your neck there.
STAN:
Aw, no, she just mistook me for somebody else.
(beat)
How do you say “I love you” in troll?
GUBBIN:
You don’t.
STAN:
Maybe you don’t. But there’s gotta be a word for it.
GUBBIN:
Good night, Stan.
STAN:
Wha? Oh, night, Gubbin.

Thank you! Now, on with the show.
MUSIC—OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Four: The Artful Dodger.
INT. BAR, MORNINE:
The opening theme is rudely interrupted by the sound of twanging ropes, grinding wooden gears, and Betula’s holler of surprise as she’s caught in a booby trap and hauled off her feet.
BETULE:
(winded, swearing)
Kakuten vilimat kruufen giss!
Ropes creak as she struggles, dangling upside down. Nothing.
BETULA (CONT’D)
Great. Dammit, Uncle…
Stan enters from the street.
STAN:
Good morning! Oh my gosh, Betula! Are you okay?
BETULE:
I’m fine.
STAN:
That doesn’t look very comfy.
BETULE:
I’m fine.
STAN:
Hanging upside down like that?
BETULE:
It’s fine. I was just looking around for something to eat and suddenly this rope thing went off.
STAN:
That’s Gubbin for you. He’s got traps everywhere and never thinks to warn anyone.
BETULE:
I should have known. The kitchen door, though?
STAN:
Yeah. The kitchen is “off limits”, apparently. Don’t feel bad. I got caught in that one myself.
BETULE:
That’s nice.
(straining)
I can’t reach my knife. Could you just…?
But Stan has started hunting around under the bar.
STAN:
Oh no, no, you shouldn’t need to cut anything. When I set that one off, Gubbin had, like a release button for it. I think it was somewhere down here…
BETULE:
No, Stan, please. Just give me my knife. It’s right here, you can see the sheath. Look. Look where I’m pointing. Stan. Here, Stan. Look.
STAN:
No, I remember he reached under the bar… he must have flipped a lever or something…
There’s a thunk as a second trap springs, catching Stan’s arm.
STAN (CONT’D)
Ow!
BETULE:
Oh gods.
STAN:
Okay, so he’s got another trap under the bar. I was not expecting that. Wow. Okay. My arm is totally stuck now. How crazy is that?
BETULE:
Great.
STAN:
That Gubbin. What a smart guy!
BETULE:
Yeah, what a guy.
STAN:
(raises his voice)
Hey Gubbin! Are you up yet?
BETULE:
Oh yes, let’s get Uncle in here so he can gloat. That’s a great idea.
The two keep twisting and straining throughout the following:
STAN:
So. Is this your first time in Farloria?
BETULE:
What? Yeah. First time.
STAN:
Nice. Nice. How are you enjoying it so far?
BETULE:
So far, let’s see… I had to drag my trunk all over town looking for this place, and now I’m hanging from the ceiling in one of my uncle’s stupid booby traps.
STAN:
Right. Yeah. That’s a lousy start. Hey, if you’re free today, I can give you that guided tour of Grandville. Let you see the city properly.
BETULE:
That’s nice of you, but I’ve gotta be on my way today.
STAN:
Awww, no, really? Where you headed?
BETULE:
Away. East.
STAN:
Like, toward Mediocria? That’s a… nice part of the country.
BETULE:
So I hear.
STAN:
So you don’t even have time for a little sightseeing?
BETULE:
Sorry, no.
STAN:
Aw. Oh, by the way… you still gotta change your money, right?
BETULE:
Right…
STAN:
Well… I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you know that Mellurian coin you gave us last night?
BETULE:
What about it?
As he speaks, Stan fishes in his pockets with his wrong hand, and finally comes up with the coin.
STAN:
I took it to the bank this morning, and they showed me this really cool thing. See, here’s your coin. And if I weigh it… well, I don’t think we have a balance here, but apparently this coin weighs the same as two hundred and fourteen grains of barley.
BETULE:
That’s fascinating.
She strains harder at the ropes.
STAN:
But then, get this, you stick it in water, and then I think it’s the amount that spills out divided by the number of grains, something like that? Anyway. I didn’t want to tell Gubbin, since he would blow it out of proportion, but… the point is, it’s not real.
BETULE:
What’s not?
STAN:
This coin. I think someone back in Melluria gave you some fake currency—
BETULE:
What do you mean, not real?
At that moment, Gubbin trudges in.
GUBBIN:
What’s not real?
STAN AND BETULE:
Nothing!
GUBBIN:
Huh. Someone been trying to jimmy the lock on the kitchen door?
BETULE:
I was hungry. I thought you might have some food around.
GUBBIN:
Kitchen’s off limits.
BETULE:
Apparently.
GUBBIN:
Let’s see that coin, Stan.
STAN:
I do not know what coin you are currently referring to—
(as Gubbin prises open his fingers)
Ow, ow, ow. Okay. Right. Yes. This coin right here.
GUBBIN:
Huh. “Regna da Melluria—5 royales”. That look real to you?
(he taps it on the bar)
Looks like gold, doesn’t it?
BETULE:
It is gold.
GUBBIN:
Well, let’s just see here…
STAN:
No, don’t! Aw, Gubbin…
Gubbin bites the coin in half and spits out the pieces.
GUBBIN:
Well, would ya look at that. Solid lead! With a layer of brass, and just the tiniest little bit of gold leaf around it. Probably worth, what, about sixpence?
STAN:
I heard lead isn’t very good for you.
GUBBIN:
This ain’t legal tender. There or here.
BETULE:
Well, how was I supposed to know? I’m not an alchemist.
(beat)
Can you let me out of this net?
STAN:
Oh, while you’re at it, I’m kinda stuck too.
GUBBIN:
This all the money you got?
BETULE:
Yeah. I mean, I got more money, but it’s just more of these.
GUBBIN:
Where’d you get ’em?
BETULE:
In Melluria. (pronounced “Meyuria”) Uncle, let me out of this stupid trap.
GUBBIN:
Where in Melluria?
BETULE:
It’s “Meyuria”.
GUBBIN:
Where in “Meyuria”.
BETULE:
A guy.
GUBBIN:
What guy.
BETULE:
Just a guy. An artist.
GUBBIN:
Oh, here we go.
STAN:
What, is there something wrong with artists?
GUBBIN:
What was his name?
BETULE:
(reluctant)
Arvando Bassi.
GUBBIN:
Bassi!
BETULE:
Yes.
STAN:
Why do I know that name?
GUBBIN:
What hell were you doing taking money from a Mellurian artist? One of the Bassis, no less?
BETULE:
Let me down and I’ll tell you.
GUBBIN:
(considers)
Fine.
He presses a hidden button and the trap dumps Betula out on the floor.
BETULE:
Ow.
STAN:
Betula! You okay?
BETULE:
A bit of warning would have been nice.
GUBBIN:
How did you get mixed up with the Bassis?
STAN:
Also, who are they? Also, can you let me out next?
GUBBIN:
The Bassis are the most notorious art cabal in Melluria.
STAN:
Notorious how?
BETULE:
Turns out they’re into art theft, forging sculptures and paintings, ancient relics… and I guess forging money, too.
GUBBIN:
Won’t find a more subversive, transgressive band of hoodlums this side of the Pointy Lands.
BETULE:
But I didn’t know any of that when I met Arvando.
GUBBIN:
So what were you doing in Melluria?
BETULE:
I was going to school there, working odd jobs to get by, and then one day this guy approached me, said he was a painter and a sculptor and wanted to hire me as his model.
STAN:
You worked as a model?
BETULE:
So I said okay. And so Arvando did a couple of paintings of me. But soon he had me helping him out with frescoes and installations, carrying his supplies, setting up scaffolding… and sometimes I’d just stand outside while he was chatting with someone, and make sure they saw me. The way he talked, I figured it was just because he wanted to show me off.
GUBBIN:
Uh huh.
BETULE:
Which was a little weird, but whatever. What can I say? He could talk anyone into anything.
GUBBIN:
Especially with a seven-foot-high troll standing next to him. Can’t believe you were working for Arvando Bassi.
BETULE:
I just thought he was a solid guy, okay? He paid me good money.
GUBBIN:
Good fake money.
BETULE:
Yes. Anyway. We spend weeks preparing for his next big show. Lots of pictures of the rich and famous, trying to win over new patrons. So this hall’s full of dukes and bishops and bankers, and when it comes time for opening night… this rival group called the Magical Demolitionists have vandalized every piece in the hall.
STAN:
Oh no! Like, they smashed everything?
BETULE:
Worse. They changed things. They took the heads off his sculptures and switched them. They cut up his paintings and rearranged them. And in doing so they recontextualized them in a manner that forced one to confront the paradoxical and hypocritical nature of power and legitimacy in modern society.
GUBBIN:
(beat)
Frickin’ artists.
STAN:
I don’t get it.
BETULE:
Don’t you see? He invited all these nobles so he could flatter them, and instead, all they saw were paintings full of symbolism about how they were lying, and sleeping with each other, and stealing from everyone in the kingdom.
GUBBIN:
Which was all lies, I’m sure.
BETULE:
Oh, it was all true. But you still shouldn’t put it in a painting. They would have killed him for treason if his parents hadn’t stepped in.
But all of a sudden, every two-bit fresco painter decided they wanted a piece. All the movements and factions piled on, trying to get the upper hand. One day, all six members of the Maniacal Five had their heads mysteriously bashed in by gargoyles falling off buildings.
STAN:
Whoa.
BETULE:
That was the Demos, of course. The Demolitionists. Before long they had control of the trade in watercolours and miniatures. Then they got together with the East Side Post-Reasonablists to take on the Bassis head-to-head.
GUBBIN:
Huh. And the Bassis?
BETULE:
Arvando was laying low after the big fiasco. But that was before the whole Azandia thing.
GUBBIN:
What’s an Azandia?
BETULE:
His racehorse. She was a gift from his parents, I think.
STAN:
Uh oh…
BETULE:
Arvando loved that horse. Fed her on wine and pastries. He got me to install a toiletti for her in the stable.
GUBBIN:
A what?
BETULE:
A water closet. It’s like a chamber pot, but it’s got running water.
GUBBIN:
What the hell for?
BETULE:
For flushing it. It’s the latest thing in Melluria. Very expensive.
GUBBIN:
He had you install a “toiletti” for his horse?
BETULE:
I told you, Azandia was his little princess! Literally, he made her a silver tiara. But anyway, a couple weeks after the Demolitionists make their move, Arvando’s got an unveiling. Great big statue of the Duke, in the main square.
I’m working security, in case anybody tries anything creative. I catch a couple of Demos trying to sneak in with brushes and glue, so I knock some sense into them. And… that’s it. The unveiling goes off without a hitch. All his patrons are overjoyed…
GUBBIN:
But…?
BETULE:
But that night, Arvando comes home from the big party, goes up to his chambers…
STAN:
Oh no. I don’t like this story.
BETULE:
And finds the bedclothes all stained, and sitting right in the middle of the bed…
STAN:
No, stop, seriously…
BETULE:
Is Azandia the horse’s brand new toiletti.
STAN:
Wait, what?
BETULE:
And in front of it, there’s a little plaque, like in a museum. Says, “The Complete Works of Arvando Bassi”.
STAN:
Wow. That’s… I guess that’s… terrible?
BETULE:
Yeah, that was just way too on-the-nose. Arvando basically snapped. Started a new series of allegorical portraits of his enemies.
STAN:
Portraits? Could have been worse! At least he wasn’t—
BETULE:
Using their own blood.
STAN:
O‑kay.
BETULE:
I kept thinking, these paintings smell weird. But I didn’t clue in until the night he had me line the floor and walls with canvases, gave me this big knife and asked me to help him “bring someone in”. So at that point I figured it was time for me to make an exit.
GUBBIN:
You stole his money and ran.
BETULE:
What else was I gonna do?
STAN:
At least it wasn’t real money.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, at least it was counterfeit that you stole. From a gangster. And paid your uncle with.
BETULE:
Look, I’m sorry about the coins. I honestly didn’t know.
GUBBIN:
You think he knows where you went?
BETULE:
I covered my tracks pretty well. I mean, it’s always kinda hard being discreet in human country.
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Well. I can’t guarantee you’ll be safe here, but if you need a place to stay…
BETULE:
I don’t want to bring anything bad down on you guys.
GUBBIN:
We’ll deal. Anyone shows up in town and starts asking about trolls, I’ll hear about it. Your artist friends come for you, they’ll have to come through me.
BETULE:
Thanks, Uncle.
STAN:
And me.
BETULE:
…Sure.
GUBBIN:
So? Anna Betula. You gonna be sensible about this?
BETULE:
Yeah. I’ll stay.
STAN:
Woo hoo!
BETULE:
Thanks, Uncle.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, you’re welcome. It’s two crowns a night. No meals.
STAN:
Gubbin.
BETULE:
No, it’s fine. I just need to find a place to change these coins…
GUBBIN:
Stan tried to change one at the bank. Word’s gonna get out. No one’s gonna take those anywhere in town.
STAN:
I can help you out with rent.
BETULE:
No. I can pay my own way. I’ll find work and I’ll pay you back properly, Uncle.
Betula heads for the stairs while Gubbin goes outside.
GUBBIN:
See to it. You got one week.
BETULE:
Thanks.
Gubbin shuts the door behind him.
STAN:
Yay! It all worked out.
He wrestles with the trap mechanism.
STAN (CONT’D)
My arm is still stuck. Hello? Guys? I’m still—guys? Can you come back? ‘Cause I’m still… in the trap…

MUSIC: OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Five: The Job Hunt.
INT. BAR, MORNINE:
The outside door opens and Stan enters.
STAN:
Morning, Gubbin!
GUBBIN:
Ugh. Don’t remind me.
STAN:
Happens every day, you better get used to it!
GUBBIN:
You here to see Betula?
STAN:
Who? Oh, your niece, right.
GUBBIN:
“Oh, your niece.” Bit late to play it casual, kid.
STAN:
Well, sure, she’s nice and all…
GUBBIN:
Says the guy with a bouquet of flowers.
STAN:
They’re for the bar!
GUBBIN:
Yeah, why didn’t I think of that? Roses on the tables, that’s just what the place needs. Roses on the vomit-stained tables, maybe some nice doilies to go under the pastries.
STAN:
When have you ever served pastries?
GUBBIN:
(a sore point)
We used to.
STAN:
Well, if we just fix up the kitchen and hire a cook…
GUBBIN:
Eh. Too much hassle.
STAN:
Do you think she likes flowers?
GUBBIN:
Who, my niece?
STAN:
Yeah, your niece. What does she like? Flowers? Marzipan? Walks on the beach?
GUBBIN:
The hell should I know? Ask her yourself!
STAN:
I can’t just come out and ask her… that’s like cheating.
GUBBIN:
What is it with you humans? You can’t learn to say what you mean?
STAN:
It’s just not… the way we do things.
GUBBIN:
All this “hello” and “nice to see you” and “oh, no, that’s fine.” It’s like there’s a layer of gunk between you and the real world. It’s like… eating with a fork.
STAN:
What are you saying, exactly?
GUBBIN:
Say what you mean, is what I’m saying.
STAN:
You don’t always say what you mean. “Roses on the tables, that’s what this place needs!”
GUBBIN:
That’s called irony.
Betula comes down the stairs, sleepy and cross.
STAN:
Hi, Miss Betula!
BETULE:
Oh, good morning, Stan.
STAN:
Would you care for a flower?
BETULE:
Sure. I’m starving.
She eats the flower.
STAN:
Ah. Oh. Oh, no, okay. You might want to be careful of those thorns…
(too late)
Oh. Yeah, okay. So. Did you sleep well?
BETULE:
No, not at all. The bed is so soft and cozy.
STAN:
Isn’t that a good thing?
BETULE:
I think my spine actually oozed out of shape in the night. Uncle, didn’t you say you just renovated?
STAN:
Yeah, we did.
GUBBIN:
(happily)
Slipped my mind.
BETULE:
You gave me the squishy bed on purpose.
STAN:
I’m so sorry! I didn’t know. Why don’t we move you to a room with a, uh… a classic mattress?
BETULE:
That would be nice. See, Uncle? That’s how to run a tavern.
GUBBIN:
You complaining about the free room I’m giving you?
BETULE:
Look, I’ll pay you, Uncle. I just need to find work.
GUBBIN:
Well, you got six days left. Time’s a‑wasting.
STAN:
Yes! Speaking of work… Let’s find you a job.
He unfolds a newspaper.
BETULE:
Well, today I was just gonna see if anyone down at the docks needs day labourers.
GUBBIN:
(scoffs)
Kinda late in the morning for that. They all start work at dawn. Hell, I run a bar and I was up before you.
BETULE:
Well, strangely enough, I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night.
Stan flourishes his paper.
STAN:
I got the classified ads from the Grandville Gazette right here. That’s where I’d start if I was looking.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, say, why don’t we find you both a job?
STAN:
Not me! I got the old Axe and Crown to keep me busy.
GUBBIN:
No, seriously.
STAN:
Can’t talk, reading. “Accountants Wanted…”
BETULE:
I’m not an accountant.
STAN:
“Actors for a new production of The Ghastly Murder of Count Bozannio.”
BETULE:
Do they have any roles for trolls?
STAN:
Hey, you never know!
GUBBIN:
Yeah, maybe the Count gets murdered by a seven-foot-tall strongwoman.
Stan circles the ad with a pen.
STAN:
True. True. I’ll put that down as a “maybe”. Hmm. “Architect-slash-baker sought for Gingerbread Construction, Limited.” Um… “Chimney Sweeps…”
BETULE:
I don’t think we’re going to find anything in the paper.
STAN:
No, you gotta dream big! I mean… what did you always want to be when you grew up?
BETULE:
Uh… Champion smashball player?
Stan leafs through the pages.
STAN:
Okay, cool…
BETULE:
Or a carpenter. Or gryphon trainer.
STAN:
Hmm. I don’t see any openings. This week, anyway.
GUBBIN:
No, because Farlorians don’t play smashball, they don’t keep gryphons as pets, and you can’t be a carpenter if you’re not in the Guild.
STAN:
Well then, isn’t it lucky I’ve got contacts in half the construction guilds in the city.
GUBBIN:
(laughing)
Yeah, I’m sure your name carries a lot of weight.
STAN:
It does, actually. They all did work for my father’s old company.
(to Betula)
He was a real estate developer. He left me this place when he died.
BETULE:
Really? So you run his company now?
STAN:
Well, no… my sister inherited the company.
GUBBIN:
Oh yeah, right. I heard about that. Your big sister got everything, right?
STAN:
I mean, she’s actually younger than me, but basically—
GUBBIN:
Oh, yeah, that’s right. So, how old’s your sister, Stan?
STAN:
Oh. Well, uh… she…
GUBBIN:
Yeah, go on.
STAN:
…is… twelve.
BETULE:
Wow. And your father left the family business to her?
GUBBIN:
While Stan got this fine establishment.
STAN:
Betula, if you want a construction job, I will get you a list of places. Guild pay is a heck of a lot better than day labour!
BETULE:
Thanks, Stan.
GUBBIN:
You really think they’re gonna hire her?
STAN:
They must be smart enough to see what a strong, able-bodied troll woman could do for them.
BETULE:
You make it sound like they got something against trolls here. They don’t have something against trolls, do they?
GUBBIN:
Eh, no more than most humans.
STAN:
I like trolls.
GUBBIN:
Well. We got that going for us.
STAN:
Ignore him, Betula. We’re gonna find you a job!
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR, AFTERNOON:
Betula trudges in.
STAN:
Betula! How did it go? Any takers?
BETULE:
No, it’s funny, no one’s hiring.
GUBBIN:
Hunh.
STAN:
You’re kidding! I was down in Guildhall Row last week and there were Help Wanted signs everywhere.
BETULE:
Yeah. Every guild hall I go in, it turns out they’ve just finished hiring, and they forgot to take the sign down. Or buddy who does the applications just happens to be off on vacation.
STAN:
Really? Gosh, that’s rotten luck.
BETULE:
Or no one wants to hire a troll.
GUBBIN:
Did I or did I not say this was going to happen?
BETULE:
Or a woman, probably.
STAN:
Aw, c’mon. Did you say I sent you?
BETULE:
When I managed to. At the one place that didn’t turn me away immediately.
STAN:
And that didn’t help?
BETULE:
The secretary just laughed. And laughed.
STAN:
Oh. Well, I’m a funny guy.
BETULE:
And laughed. Until she finally passed out. I filled out an application, but I’m not expecting much.
STAN:
You can’t let that stop you!
GUBBIN:
Yeah, he’s right. Keep trying, it’ll be hilarious.
BETULE:
You’re such a help, Uncle.
STAN:
Hey. Whoa. Brain explosion! Hold on. Why don’t we hire Betula?
GUBBIN:
What do you mean, “we”?
BETULE:
You could definitely use a maid.
STAN:
See, Gubbin? You’re always complaining about how much work it is running this place…
GUBBIN:
Not much cleaning to do here.
BETULE:
Well, by your standards, no.
STAN:
Hey, what about the kitchen?
GUBBIN:
What about it? It burned down.
BETULE:
(skeptical)
It did what?
GUBBIN:
There was a big fire. It’s too dangerous to go in there.
BETULE:
Really!
STAN:
So it’s a good thing Betula is an expert carpenter.
BETULE:
I said I wanted to be a carpenter.
STAN:
I will pay for the materials… We can rebuild the kitchen! Better than before!
GUBBIN:
No. It’s a safety hazard.
BETULE:
This whole tavern is a safety hazard.
STAN:
Well, let us help you clean it up. How bad can it be?
BETULE:
Yeah, Uncle.
GUBBIN:
Never mind the kitchen.
Betula has moved over to the kitchen door.
BETULE:
Hmm. It’s almost like you don’t want people to go in here.
GUBBIN:
Don’t touch that door.
STAN:
Careful—booby trapped, remember?
BETULE:
It is? Gosh, I better be careful.
She unlocks the door. The net trap trips harmlessly, with a little twang.
GUBBIN:
Hey! How did you disarm that? Stop! I told you, it’s dangerous…
But she’s already through the door.
CROSSFADE TO:
INT. KITCHEN, CONTINUOUE:
Betula strolls in. Stan follows cautiously.
STAN:
Wait. Gubbin, I thought you said there was a fire in here. There’s not even soot on the walls.
BETULE:
I know, right?
STAN:
All the pots and things are just sitting here…
BETULE:
Like someone just stopped in the middle of cooking, and ran off.
STAN:
Gubbin? You okay there, buddy?
BETULE:
Uncle?
STAN:
What happened in here?
GUBBIN:
(heavily)
He left.
BETULE:
Who left?
GUBBIN:
Johann. My… the cook.
STAN:
Your ex.
BETULE:
Wait. Wait.
GUBBIN:
He was the cook, way back when I first started working here. He helped me get over a lot of things. Helped me feel normal again, you know, after the war.
STAN:
He must have been some cook.
GUBBIN:
You have no idea. He even learned to make a few troll specialties, just for me. Only human I ever met who could make a proper domplinka.
BETULE:
Awww.
GUBBIN:
After Noreena died, he stuck around and we ran the place together for a few years. It was… nice. Easy, you know? I was out there, and he was back here, taking care of everything.
And then one night, I came back here and there’s him with this strapping young delivery guy from the greengrocer’s up the hill, having some kind of private tasting.
STAN:
Oh. Oh man. Did you guys fight?
GUBBIN:
Eh. Words were exchanged. He ran off after his delivery boy or whatever, and I just…
BETULE:
Locked the door and never went back in the kitchen again?
GUBBIN:
Haven’t had a decent meal since.
STAN:
I’m sorry, Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
Eh. Trolls and humans. It was always gonna happen.
STAN:
Well… why don’t we renovate? Reorganize, clean the place up, scrub away all those bad memories.
GUBBIN:
Who needs a kitchen?
BETULE:
Uncle, you’ve got the only tavern in town that doesn’t have food. Even the raccoon hotel down the street brings in fresh garbage for their guests.
STAN:
Yeah! C’mon, Gub. You could have pastries again…
GUBBIN:
(grunts)
STAN:
Or… what was it? Dumplinkies?
GUBBIN:
(suddenly dreamy)
Domplinka…
STAN:
(at Betula)
Yeah. Say, do we know anyone else who might know how to make domplinka?
BETULE:
What… me?
STAN:
Can you?
BETULE:
Sure, I used to make them all the time back home.
GUBBIN:
Ohhh. It’s been a long time…
STAN:
Gubbin, I think we might have found our new cook.
BETULE:
And byglintur. And kling klangs.
GUBBIN:
Keep talking.
STAN:
This is perfect! We get a cook, you get a job, everybody wins! What do you say, Gubbin?
GUBBIN:
(considers)
All right. You’re hired.
BETULE:
Thanks, you guys.
STAN:
We’ll show that Johann. Big two-timing jerk! We’re gonna turn this place around…
(sings)
Turn this place around! The best food in town! We’re gonna—
GUBBIN:
Stop. Stop. STOP THAT DANCING.
STAN:
You can cook human food too, right?
BETULE:
Right. Human food. Of course.
STAN:
Amazing.
GUBBIN:
Question is, where the hell are we gonna get groceries now?
STAN:
There’s more than one greengrocer in town. Hey, maybe you can find your own delivery guy. Eh?
GUBBIN:
Why do I even tell you things.
STAN:
“Special delivery. Special delivery for Gubbin. Hello. Where’s the handsome troll in the back?”
GUBBIN:
Stan, are you done?
STAN:
“I’d like to find you. I have a delivery just for you…”

Hi everyone. Eli here, your writer and co-producer. So. We’ve got some good news and some bad news. The bad news is: this is the last Axe & Crown episode… for a little while.

The Axe and Crown. Episode Six: What’s Cooking.
INT. BAR—NIGHE:
A nasty squelch and the clatter of a spoon in a bowl of something slimy. The bar is full of disgruntled customers.
CUSTOMEE:
I ain’t eating that.
STAN:
Sir, I’m really sorry if it’s not up to your… see, we’re currently working on perfecting our menu.
CUSTOMEE:
You call this chicken feet soup? What’s this green stuff?
STAN:
Well, I know what it looks like, but it’s actually a garnish—
CUSTOMEE:
It’s mold. That’s what it “actually” is. Also, it’s disgusting.
STAN:
I’m sorry about that, sir. We’ll get you another one right away.
CUSTOMEE:
It’s disgusting.
Stan takes the bowl and retreats to the safety of the bar.
GUBBIN:
Another one, huh?
STAN:
Yeah. That’s six meals sent back in one night. I thought you said your customers weren’t discerning.
GUBBIN:
They aren’t. If they were, they’d be burning this place down.
STAN:
(whines)
GUBBIN:
What’s the matter? All your dreams of fame and fortune in the restaurant biz going up the creek?
STAN:
What are we gonna do, Gubbin?
GUBBIN:
I dunno. Maybe… fire the cook?
STAN:
We can’t do that!
GUBBIN:
‘Cause you’ll be taking away the only job Betula’s ever gonna land in this town? Or because you’re sweet on her?
STAN:
Also she is bigger than me and can mash me into pulp.
GUBBIN:
She can’t cook.
STAN:
She can! She’s still just getting used to cooking for humans.
GUBBIN:
Hah. Still getting used to cooking, period.
STAN:
What about all those special troll dishes that she cooks for you?
GUBBIN:
Tell ya a secret. The kid’s pretty bad at those too.
STAN:
Oh.
GUBBIN:
Time for you to get in there and get firing.
STAN:
Wait—me?
GUBBIN:
I’m running the bar.
STAN:
She’s your niece.
GUBBIN:
You’re the one that hired her.
STAN:
You run the place.
GUBBIN:
And you own the place, so I think there is no higher authority on this matter, Mister Gerrard, sir!
STAN:
Look, I’m not that kind of manager! See, I’m a “carrot” person more than a “stick” person.
Gubbin shoves a rejected plate into Stan’s hands, and starts steering him toward the door.
GUBBIN:
Well, Mister Carrot, time for you to learn some new tricks. Good luck!
STAN:
No, no! She’ll wring my neck! Gubbin!
GUBBIN:
Yes, she will!
STAN:
No no no!
Gubbin pushes Stan into the kitchen, and slams the door behind him.
CROSSFADE TO:
INT. KITCHEN—CONTINUOUE:
Food is frying in the background. Betula is busy chopping something with a massive cleaver.
STAN:
Hey, Betula!
BETULE:
What do you want, Stan?
STAN:
Just… checking in and seeing how you’re doing back here.
BETULE:
Fine. I’m absolutely fine.
Something boils over and catches on fire. Betula beats down the flames and goes back to her work.
STAN:
Oh, that’s… Whoa!
BETULE:
Everything is fine.
STAN:
Oh, okay. Good. So. Anyway. There’s something I have to tell you.
BETULE:
Yeah. Okay. What?
STAN:
I have to tell you… You… uh, we…
BETULE:
Yes? Get to the point, Stan. Come on.
STAN:
I’m afraid a couple of dishes got sent back.
Betula stops in her chopping.
BETULE:
Sent back why?
STAN:
Various reasons.
BETULE:
Like?
STAN:
Ehh… that’s just it. I guess they didn’t like.
BETULE:
Why the hell not?
STAN:
Well, the pancreas poppers had some burnt bits in them…
BETULE:
What is the problem with burnt bits?
(she eats one)
Look. Nothing wrong with that. Delicious.
STAN:
There was mold on the soup.
BETULE:
Yeah, and? Mold is one of the five basic flavours.
STAN:
I tried to tell them. Oh, also this, uh… steak.
He picks up the steak and lets it fall back onto the plate with a clunk.
STAN (CONT’D)
They ordered rare.
BETULE:
You said rare means burnt.
STAN:
Other way round.
BETULE:
What?! Okay, fine. So well done is burnt—
STAN:
Not quite burnt.
BETULE:
—not quite burnt, and rare means raw.
STAN:
Not quite raw.
BETULE:
You humans are so picky.
STAN:
I know. I know. It’s terrible. We’re terrible. But it’s like Gubbin says: the customer is always right.
BETULE:
My uncle said that?
STAN:
Yeah, okay, it was someone else. But listen, I… have some difficult news.
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR—LATER THAT NIGHE:
The bar has quieted down.
ZANE:
Night, Gubbin!
GUBBIN:
Night, Zane.
Zane exits, gagging, as Stan emerges from the kitchen.
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
Hey, Carrot Boy. You’re alive.
STAN:
Yeah. No thanks to you.
GUBBIN:
You were in there a long time. How’d she take the news?
STAN:
Uh, surprisingly well, actually.
GUBBIN:
You actually fired her.
STAN:
We… came to kind of a mutual agreement.
GUBBIN:
Yeah?
STAN:
So. Betula gets a second chance, and an opportunity to develop new dishes that are more in keeping with her established style.
GUBBIN:
Her what?
Stan slaps a sheet of paper down on the bar.
STAN:
Behold our new menu! Farlorian favourites and home-cooked troll food! Eh? Eh?
GUBBIN:
I should save our patrons the trouble and burn the place down myself.
STAN:
No, it just makes sense, you know what I mean? You’ll be serving the native cuisine of your homeland… We’ll be famous! We’ll make our culinary mark on this city.
GUBBIN:
Listen, I’ve been running this place eight years. You think maybe I know a thing or two about what people wanna eat?
Betula comes out of the kitchen with a plate.
BETULE:
All right, boys. Check this out. Kling klangs.
STAN:
Awww yeah. What are these, like cookies?
GUBBIN:
Yeah, like cookies.
They each bite into one. Stan’s teeth stick instantly.
STAN:
(unable to chew)
Mmm! That is really, really interesting.
BETULE:
You like ’em?
GUBBIN:
Eh. I’ve had worse.
STAN:
(teeth still stuck)
I wasn’t expecting them to be so sour. Um, is there a trick to chewing these things?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Have troll teeth.
BETULE:
So? Have you looked at the menu?
GUBBIN:
Yeah.
BETULE:
And?
GUBBIN:
Where are you gonna find any of this stuff in town?
BETULE:
I know some guys with a boat.
STAN:
See? Betula’s got it all worked out. Look at these appetizers!
GUBBIN:
Zenyarfüsk? Really?
STAN:
What’s zen-yar-fusk?
BETULE:
It’s a fish—I think you call it pike?
STAN:
Pike! Sure.
GUBBIN:
It’s not really pike.
BETULE:
Which you bury in the ground for ten years.
STAN:
Okay, why?
BETULE:
In a special kind of dirt. That preserves it and infuses it with a certain…
STAN:
Flavour?
GUBBIN:
Texture.
BETULE:
Little mineral crystals that make it crunchy.
STAN:
Well, that sounds…
BETULE:
It’s the best. Right, uncle?
GUBBIN:
Sure, it’s good. But you do realize no human is going to eat it.
STAN:
I’ll eat it!
GUBBIN:
(thinks)
All right, keep it on the menu. I want to see that.
STAN:
Um, does this say “vulture”?
BETULE:
Yep. Vulture pie.
GUBBIN:
Vulture!
STAN:
I’ll bet no one else in town has that.
GUBBIN:
We are not serving vulture pie.
BETULE:
Why not? What’s wrong with vulture?
GUBBIN:
Nothing. But pigeons are free.
BETULE:
So? Stan, how much would you pay for a nice vulture pie?
STAN:
I… I don’t know if I could eat a vulture. They’re kind of…
BETULE:
Big?
STAN:
Gross.
BETULE:
Oh, for heaven’s sake. At least we don’t eat them raw.
GUBBIN:
Welcome to the wonderful world of human cuisine.
BETULE:
What about gatsenpfeffer?
GUBBIN:
They don’t eat cats either.
BETULE:
Yes, they do!
GUBBIN:
Okay, in Melluria they eat cats. But Farlorians don’t.
BETULE:
That makes no sense.
STAN:
Cats are so cute. And they hunt mice too.
BETULE:
So do ferrets!
GUBBIN:
Not a lot of ferrets in human cooking either. Just saying.
BETULE:
What? But they have that musk! You mix that with something lighter like fennel, and it’s just… no?
STAN:
Um…
GUBBIN:
Farlorians eat mostly anything apart from cats, horses and dogs. Except for the Orthodox Dufferites. They eat horses but they don’t eat pigs.
BETULE:
So much for my famous One Of Everything Stew.
GUBBIN:
And the Church of the Redeemed Bachelor folks won’t eat anything that has the letter A in the name.
STAN:
Including meals and snacks.
BETULE:
I give up. No one gets any more food. From now on, everyone gets beans. Cold beans.
GUBBIN:
Or you could just cook the food on the menu we already have.
BETULE:
Nope. Forget it. I’m done.
STAN:
Wait… what do you mean, done?
BETULE:
Seems like none of my ideas are good enough. Oh well. Bye, guys. Have fun serving your boring human food to your boring human customers.
STAN:
No! Wait! I thought they sounded great!
BETULE:
Except for gatsenpfeffer and vulture pie. And obviously you didn’t like the kling klangs.
STAN:
No, no, they’re good!
BETULE:
You don’t have to pretend, Stan.
STAN:
No, really! I want to make this work! Gubbin’s the one that wanted me to fire you.
BETULE:
Fire me?
GUBBIN:
Well, we can only kill so many customers before people get suspicious.
BETULE:
You want me gone, huh? Well, surprise, surprise.
GUBBIN:
You don’t seem happy here.
BETULE:
Sure, I’m happy.
STAN:
That’s why he sent me in. He wanted me to be the one to fire you.
BETULE:
But you didn’t.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, like that was ever gonna happen.
STAN:
Wait… You sent me in to not fire Betula?
GUBBIN:
Call it a social experiment.
BETULE:
So, what… you wanted me to stay all along? You just wanted me to take an interest in my work so I’d do a better job?
GUBBIN:
Well, if you’re not gonna beat Stan into the ground and quit in a huff, I guess I’ll take it.
BETULE:
Uncle. Stop playing games.
GUBBIN:
Games? Who’s playing games?
BETULE:
Do you want me to stay or leave? Tell me.
GUBBIN:
What? So you can do the opposite?
BETULE:
No!
GUBBIN:
You just want to do the exact opposite of what I want.
BETULE:
Tell me what you want and we’ll find out.
GUBBIN:
Oh, I know. Why don’t you follow your heart?
BETULE:
Why don’t you fire me?
GUBBIN:
Why don’t you act like a grown troll for once? Damn stupid kid.
BETULE:
Why don’t you—why don’t you go stick your face in a fjord?
Betula pitches the plate of kling klangs full force into Gubbin’s head, smashing it to bits.
GUBBIN:
Ow!
STAN:
Betula!
BETULE:
“Social experiment.” You just love jerking people around.
She hits him with another plate.
GUBBIN:
Nah, I just think you should—Ow! Dammit. Stop breaking my things.
STAN:
Please, Betula. Your uncle’s just being a jerk because… I don’t know why! Just ignore him.
BETULE:
Yeah, I’m gonna. Even better, I’m gonna ignore him from someplace far away.
She storms upstairs.
GUBBIN:
Aw, you going to go pack your twunky-wunky and leavey-weavey?
STAN:
Betula, wait!
Stan moves to follow her, but Gubbin puts a hand on his shoulder.
GUBBIN:
Oh, I wouldn’t.
STAN:
Let go.
GUBBIN:
You got little thin human bones, and she’s in a mood.
STAN:
Yeah, she is. I wonder why.
GUBBIN:
What? You want to experience troll culture? Well, here ya go. This is a typical night with a typical troll family.
STAN:
Where you insult each other and throw things.
Gubbin dusts himself off.
GUBBIN:
It’s how we show love. Ugh, good aim, that girl.
STAN:
Serves you right. Here she comes. You need to apologize to her right now.
Betula reappears, dragging her trunk down the stairs—wham! wham! wham! and then heads out the door.
GUBBIN:
Yes, you’re right, Stan. I’ve been a fool and I should apologize.
(to Betula)
Hey! You owe me a week’s rent and two new plates!
BETULE:
Go to hell!
GUBBIN:
And stop scuffing my floor!
STAN:
Wait! Betula!
She slams the door behind her.
GUBBIN:
Thank the gods that’s over. Hey kid, pass me the broom.
STAN:
Uh-uh. I quit too.
GUBBIN:
You can’t quit. You own the place.
STAN:
I quit!
He follows Betula into the street. The door swings shut.
GUBBIN:
Finally, some peace and quiet.
(beat)
Yeah.
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR—LATER STILE:
Tools rattle in the front door lock. After a couple of tries, Betula manages to open the door. A cold wind whistles outside as she sneaks in and sets Stan on the floor.
BETULE:
(whispers)
All right, we’re here.
STAN:
(shivering and barely conscious)
Yaaay. Wait, isn’t this the Axe and Crown?
BETULE:
Yeah.
STAN:
But… I thought we were running away.
BETULE:
I’m running away. You’ve got a life here, helping Uncle run this place.
STAN:
Your uncle is a stupid stupid head.
BETULE:
Whoa, whoa. Careful! You almost set off the booby trap.
STAN:
What booby trap? Whoa!
Betula carefully trips a tripwire. There’s a clunk, a twang, and an arrow thunks into the door.
She sets him down in the kitchen.
BETULE:
Just lie down here by the stove and warm up. You’re freezing.
STAN:
Why can’t I come with you, Betula?
BETULE:
Because you’re fragile. Like a baby bunny. You won’t be able to keep up.
STAN:
I can so. How many miles did we just walk?
BETULE:
Lots. Look, Stan, I’ve gotta get going before Uncle hears us and comes down.
STAN:
I can’t come with you?
BETULE:
No. Take care, Stan.
STAN:
No, I’m good, just let me rest for a minute and I’ll… be…
Stan trails off as he falls asleep.
BETULE:
(sighs)
Sleep tight, little bunny. I’ll miss you.
GUBBIN:
“Bunny”?
Betula whirls around.
BETULE:
Wha! Uncle!
GUBBIN:
Did you just call him “little bunny”?
BETULE:
“Buddy”. I said “buddy”.
GUBBIN:
Sure you did.
BETULE:
I did.
GUBBIN:
Why’d you have to go and bring him back?
BETULE:
He belongs here. This is his place.
GUBBIN:
Eh, technically. What about you?
BETULE:
I don’t have a place.
GUBBIN:
(grunts)
Your room’s still vacant, if you need it.
BETULE:
No. I’m going.
GUBBIN:
Suit yourself.
Betuula opens the front door.
BETULE:
You take care of him, you hear?
GUBBIN:
Sure.
BETULE:
Bye, Uncle.
GUBBIN:
Night.
She heads out into the windy night.
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
Stupid kid.

MUSIC—OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Seven: Under Construction.
INT. BAR—AFTERNOON:
The outside door opens. Stan hums as he wheels in a barrel of ale on a creaking cart.
STAN:
Hey, Gubbin. Look what I got.
GUBBIN:
Kid, where the hell you been all afternoon?
STAN:
Just at the brewery, picking up a new cask of Pete’s Blue Rabbit Ale!
GUBBIN:
Oh no. Stan, what have I told you about sullying my tavern with that stuff? It’s so bad, even my regulars won’t touch it.
STAN:
People love Pete’s!
GUBBIN:
Your poetry-reading loser friends love it. More to the point, it’s what your new crush always orders.
STAN:
Hey, hey. She’s not my crush.
GUBBIN:
“Oh, she’s so dark and mysterious, like the night!”
STAN:
Also Pete’s is cheap. Which equals bigger margins, which equals more money!
GUBBIN:
Yeah, yeah. Grab an apron. It’s about to get busy in here.
STAN:
Sure is! Did you see how many people are working that new construction site? And they’re gonna be good and thirsty coming off their shift.
GUBBIN:
Not thirsty enough to drink Pete’s Blue Rabbit.
STAN:
Oh yeah? I’ll bet I can sell half this cask before we close tonight.
GUBBIN:
You’re on. Oh, here they come.
The door swings open. A handful of workers enter, talking loudly, and sit around the tables.
STAN:
Good afternoon, folks! Can I get you a beer? We’ve got a special tonight. Half a crown for a pitcher of Pete’s Blue—
(he realizes who it is)
GUBBIN:
Oh no.
BETULE:
(loudly, for Gubbin’s benefit)
What? We’re coming here for drinks? To this dump? Oh, hey.
STAN:
Betula.
BETULE:
Stan. Hi!
GUBBIN:
Uh… I’ll be over here.
He retreats to the other end of the bar while Stan and Betula talk.
CUSTOMEE:
Hey, can we get a couple of beers?
STAN:
So you’re back.
BETULE:
Yeah. Turns out I’m working just across the street now. Crazy, right?
STAN:
Yeah. Crazy.
CUSTOMEE:
Hello?
STAN:
So you’re on the construction site?
BETULE:
Yup. Meet the newest member of the Builders and Bricklayers’ Guild.
STAN:
Really? You got into the Guild? Hey, congrats.
BETULE:
Yeah, thanks. Lots of new building starting up lately, so they’ve been hiring like crazy. I just started my apprenticeship there this week.
STAN:
I always knew you could do it.
BETULE:
Thanks Stan.
CUSTOMEE:
Can we get a couple of beers over here?
BETULE:
Things going well here?
STAN:
Oh yeah, yeah. It’s good, it’s good. We’re getting more bands in on Fridays and Saturdays. Oh, and I started taking a correspondence course in business management.
BETULE:
Oh hey, good for you.
STAN:
And Gubbin’s… you know. He’s himself.
BETULE:
I know.
STAN:
You want a drink?
BETULE:
Yeah, actually.
STAN:
We’ve got a special on Pete’s Blue Rabbit.
BETULE:
Oh… no thanks.
(to Gubbin)
Oh, barkeep…!
GUBBIN:
Yeah?
CUSTOMEE:
Uh, hello, we were next.
GUBBIN:
What are you doing here?
BETULE:
Just stopping in at the local for a beer with my friends from work.
GUBBIN:
Uh huh? You gonna pay for that beer?
BETULE:
Yes.
GUBBIN:
With real money?
BETULE:
Yep. I got a steady job now, see.
GUBBIN:
Aren’t we special.
BETULE:
Yeah, we are. See? Genuine Farlorian.
Betula slaps a coin on the bar.
GUBBIN:
Sure.
BETULE:
I’ll have a pint of your finest dishwater, please.
GUBBIN:
You watch your language, young lady.
Gubbin starts pouring a beer.
BETULE:
Ooh, wait. Can you make it a Golden Goose instead? You know, with the little umbrella and everything?
GUBBIN:
In your dreams.
BETULE:
I’ll give you a good tip!
GUBBIN:
Here’s your beer. Get your own damn umbrella.
BETULE:
Got anything to eat?
GUBBIN:
You know we don’t.
STAN:
The kitchen’s back to being closed again.
BETULE:
I figured.
GUBBIN:
So. What’s this thing they got you guys building across the street?
BETULE:
We’re converting the old warehouse. Marco the foreman said it was gonna be some kind of pub.
GUBBIN:
A pub.
STAN:
Ooh, competition. Exciting!
BETULE:
Yeah. It’s supposed to be called the Badger and Bucket.
STAN:
Really!
GUBBIN:
Tell me you didn’t just say “Bucket”.
BETULE:
Yeah, why?
Gubbin goes to the window and yanks the curtain open.
CUSTOMEE:
Come on! What do we gotta do to get some service?
GUBBIN:
“Future home of the Badger and—” Oh, great. First the mob, now you’re working for a Bucket Pub.
STAN:
What’s wrong with Bucket Pubs?
BETULE:
Yeah. It’s just a pub, isn’t it?
GUBBIN:
Damn things are everywhere now. The Horse and Bucket, the Walrus and Bucket, Ye Olde Bucket O’ Hooch…
BETULE:
All owned by the same people?
GUBBIN:
Nah. They do this weird fealty thing.
STAN:
It’s pretty neat, actually. We’re doing a module on it later in my course.
GUBBIN:
A “module”?
STAN:
See, anyone can open a Bucket Pub, as long as they swear allegiance to the Bucket Lords and do everything by the book… They’re not actual lords, by the way. That’s just the name of their company.
BETULE:
Ah.
GUBBIN:
So they all got the same menu, the same decorations, the same signs with those stupid pictures…
STAN:
Hey, I love their sign! Heh. It’s funny because the badger looks like he’s throwing up in the bucket, do you see that?
GUBBIN:
Oughta be a law against those places.
BETULE:
Why?
GUBBIN:
They’re fake. They’re supposed to look like a real dive, the kind of place your average well-to-do lady or gentleman would be afraid to set foot in. But inside they’re all nice and clean, not a spot on the silverware…
BETULE:
Gosh, that sounds just terrible.
STAN:
I know, right? Clean, and friendly, and you know you’re gonna get what you expect.
GUBBIN:
You should hate them! You with all your authentic real-life Mud Street crap.
STAN:
It’s a smart business model. But I mean, yeah, I think people will see the difference and come to a place that has real heart, real soul…
BETULE:
Real dirty tankards.
GUBBIN:
Say, why don’t you go party with your new “colleagues” over there?
BETULE:
Fine.
Betula picks up her beer and moves off.
CUSTOMEE:
Hello! Barkeep!
GUBBIN:
So. We got competition.
STAN:
Yeah. I guess we’re going to have to start improving this place. Keeping up with the Bucket Lords, right?
GUBBIN:
Right. I know what we can do.
STAN:
That’s the spirit, Gubbin. Competition fosters innovation and creativity.
GUBBIN:
True enough. True enough. Stan, you know those buddies of yours painted our sign?
STAN:
Yeah, sure, why?
GUBBIN:
Got a little project for them.
STAN:
Okay, I’ll let them know.
(beat)
Gubbin?
GUBBIN:
Yeah, Stan.
STAN:
I guess I really don’t know much about trolls.
GUBBIN:
What do you want, a book?
STAN:
Do you think Betula likes me?
GUBBIN:
She hasn’t killed you yet.
STAN:
Yeah, okay, I know, but seriously.
GUBBIN:
Oh, you mean, does she like you in that way.
STAN:
Yes.
GUBBIN:
That flowers and candy kind of way.
STAN:
Yes.
GUBBIN:
That romantic, boy-meets-girl, kissy-kissy kind of… ugh, never mind.
STAN:
Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
Look, you wanna know what she’s feeling deep down, you gotta ask her.
STAN:
You’re a troll, she’s a troll, I thought you might—
GUBBIN:
She’s a troll woman. Not really my field of expertise.
STAN:
Well, okay, but…
GUBBIN:
Ask her. That’s how troll courtship starts. One person or the other comes up and says, “I want to court you.”
STAN:
Really? That’s it?
GUBBIN:
Yeah.
STAN:
And if she says no?
GUBBIN:
Then she says no. That’s it. Easy.
STAN:
Easy!
GUBBIN:
Now, if she says yes… then it gets complicated.
STAN:
How so?
GUBBIN:
There’s tests and trials… It’s probably gonna end in tears or major injury, but whatever. You go for it.
STAN:
Just ask.
GUBBIN:
Yup.
STAN:
All right! Thanks Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
Uh huh.
(under his breath)
Help! Help! I’m a tender little flower! Don’t hurt me!
(makes squishing noises)
STAN:
You missed her too, didn’t you.
GUBBIN:
Eh.
CUSTOMEE:
Excuse me! Can we get two beers?!
GUBBIN:
Shut your goddamn pie hole, I’m coming.
STAN:
“Hi Betula! I want to court you.” “Hi, Betula—” I’ll work on it.
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR—LATEE:
BETULE:
Hey Stan. What do I owe?
STAN:
Oh, it’s on the house.
BETULE:
No.
STAN:
Yes! Welcome back.
BETULE:
Aww, you’re the best.
STAN:
Hey, listen, I… want to ask you. Did you… did you go anywhere interesting?
BETULE:
Interesting?
STAN:
Yeah. After you ran away. Did you head east, like you were planning to?
BETULE:
Mostly I’ve just been here in Grandville.
STAN:
You were here? All this time?
BETULE:
Yeah.
STAN:
You didn’t come back to visit?
BETULE:
Well, after that little argument with Uncle…
STAN:
Right. No. Right. Say no more.
(beat)
It’s just that, well, you know. Maybe it’s just me, but I thought that maybe there might be a chance of you and me being, like, a thing.
BETULE:
A “thing”.
STAN:
Yeah.
BETULE:
Uh… what kind of thing?
STAN:
It’s an expression, you know, I want to… uh…
BETULE:
You want to be a thing.
STAN:
Yes. Yes.
BETULE:
You mean, turning into a thing? That sounds more like a curse.
STAN:
No, not like that. Ha ha, I mean, hopefully not! I just want to—
BETULE:
I’m just confused. So we’re trying not to turn into things?
STAN:
No, no. A thing.
BETULE:
Both of us… turning into one thing. Like, merging?
STAN:
I mean… yeah. Poetically, that’s nice. Kind of. Sort of, yeah.
BETULE:
No, no. That sounds frightening.
STAN:
Yeah. No. But that kind of thing. Both of us, together. In a romantic way.
BETULE:
Oh, okay. Romantic… as in marriage.
STAN:
Well, not right away! But, you know…
BETULE:
Oh.
STAN:
In the sense of a chain of events that might one day culminate in…
BETULE:
Oh. You and me.
STAN:
Sure.
BETULE:
Marriage.
STAN:
Well.
Betula starts laughing. Stan laughs along with her, until she eventually stops herself.
BETULE:
Sorry, sorry. It’s just—you thought we were a “thing”?
STAN:
No! No! I thought that maybe you thought that.
BETULE:
Oh! Really? Did I say something?
STAN:
I dunno, it was more just a feeling. I mean, trolls and humans, there’s bound to be some…
BETULE:
Misunderstandings.
STAN:
Yes. Exactly.
BETULE:
Well, for the record, if I wanted to court, I’d have said so.
STAN:
Okay, that’s good. That’s very, very clear.
BETULE:
‘Cause you and me, we’re friends.
STAN:
Right. Yes. Thank you.
BETULE:
You’re my little human buddy. You’re all cute and squishy, you’re always super nice and help me out with everything.
STAN:
Yeah, that’s—exactly. I mean, I try.
BETULE:
Gods, I hope you weren’t pining for me all this time.
STAN:
Me? Naw. I’m good. I totally have a girlfriend and everything…
BETULE:
You do? Oh, I’m glad! What’s she like?
STAN:
Oh, she’s a poet, you know… very dark and brooding.
BETULE:
That sounds like quite a match.
STAN:
Yeah.
BETULE:
Well, tell her she’d better not let you down. Eh?
STAN:
Okay.
BETULE:
No one hurts my little buddy.
STAN:
Thanks.
BETULE:
Well, I should, uh… I should get going. Gotta be back across the street in the morning. Thanks for the beer, huh? I’ll see you tomorrow.
STAN:
Yeah, you’re welcome. I’ll see you tomorrow.
Betula heads out with some of her co-workers.
GUBBIN:
You all right, kid?
STAN:
Permission to go and die in a corner, sir?
GUBBIN:
Well, like I say, it’s probably better than if she said yes.
STAN:
Better how?
GUBBIN:
Troll courtship gets complicated. The lady’s supposed to name a big test or trial for her suitor before he can win her hand.
STAN:
What kind of trials?
GUBBIN:
Could be a quest, could be a riddle, could be “build a house”. Depends oh what she’s after.
STAN:
So is it different for guys? Did you make Johann do a big test?
GUBBIN:
Nah.
STAN:
No, wait. Which one of you was, you know, the lady?
GUBBIN:
None of us was the lady. Though I guess I did kind of challenge him to learn to cook troll food…
STAN:
Ah! So you were the lady.
GUBBIN:
Eh, fair enough.
STAN:
Awww, that’s sweet.
GUBBIN:
No it’s not. Night, Stan.
STAN:
Good night, Gubbin.

MUSIC—OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Eight: Cracking Up.
INT. BAR—MORNINE:
Betula and her crew burst in.
BETULE:
Good morning! Ahoy! Barkeep!
GUBBIN:
You again.
BETULE:
Damn right. Let’s get some beers going here!
GUBBIN:
It’s ten in the morning. Shouldn’t you all be, I dunno, working?
BETULE:
Nope. The crew just found some big cracks in the foundation this morning, so we had to clear the site. No one goes in until they can get a town building inspector in there.
GUBBIN:
Really. Sorry to hear it.
BETULE:
But… since it’s circumstances out of our control, we’re still on the clock. Right, boss?
MARCE:
That’s right. Guild rules.
Betula slaps a coin down.
BETULE:
I’ll get the first round.
A cheer goes up at this.
GUBBIN:
Sure thing.
Gubbin starts filling a tankard.
BETULE:
Thanks, Uncle.
MARCE:
Oh yeah. You two are related, huh?
BETULE:
Yup. This is my uncle Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
(grunts)
MARCE:
Marco. Nice to meet you. So, does that mean you get a family discount here, Betula?
GUBBIN AND BETULE:
Nope.
GUBBIN:
She’s lucky I’m not throwing her out on her pointy ear. You the foreman over there?
MARCE:
Yeah. I’m Betula’s boss.
GUBBIN:
You poor bastard. Sure you don’t want something stronger?
MARCE:
So, it must come from the other side of the family, huh? The size?
GUBBIN:
Nah, troll women are just bigger.
Gubbin passes him a tankard of beer.
MARCE:
Ah, I gotcha. Well, we’re glad to have her. Though she better be careful she doesn’t work too hard, and make us little guys look bad.
GUBBIN:
Aah, I wouldn’t be too worried.
BETULE:
Watch it, Uncle.
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR—LATEE:
MARCE:
And the priest says, “Well, see if I buy an altar from those guys again!”
Laughter. Stan enters.
STAN:
Morning, Gubbin!
GUBBIN:
Hey, bunny boy! Stan!
STAN:
Hey, what’s everyone doing over here? It’s not even lunchtime.
GUBBIN:
They’re having some safety concerns over at the construction site.
STAN:
Whoa, really?
MARCE:
Yeah. Cracks in the foundation. We’re waiting for it to be inspected.
STAN:
Aw, man. I guess construction’s gonna be delayed, huh?
MARCE:
Yeah, couple days, at least.
STAN:
Aw, geez. I guess you can’t be too careful.
MARCE:
I know. Might have to file a grievance about this inspector, too. He gave the all clear for this project a month ago, and then we suddenly discover cracks?
GUBBIN:
Well, can’t say I blame him too much for not looking closer. There were squatters living in there for years.
MARCE:
Yeah, we know.
GUBBIN:
Did a whooole lot of squatting, if you know what I mean.
MARCE:
Yeah. We know.
GUBBIN:
But you know the real problem, it’s the river. The street floods every spring.
STAN:
That’s why they call it Mud Street!
GUBBIN:
It’s always washing away the ground from under you, and you better have good footings under your building, or one day—down it goes, like a drunken centaur. Whump! Ever seen a centaur go down? Oh, man! It ain’t pretty.
The door opens, and Dorothea enters. A hush falls.
MARCE:
Oh no.
STAN:
What’s going on? Who’s this?
MARCE:
That’s the big boss. Dorothea Dannery.
STAN:
Oh! The Badger and Bucket lady?
MARCE:
Yeah, her.
DOROTHEE:
Mister Krabchov.
MARCE:
Mrs Dannery.
DOROTHEE:
I see your crew are enjoying their down time.
MARCE:
Guild rules. We can’t go back to work, and the town inspector’s probably gonna be a couple of days—
DOROTHEE:
Oh, the inspector just stopped by!
MARCE:
What?
GUBBIN:
How the hell did you manage that?
DOROTHEE:
Well, it helps to be nice to the good folks at the town hall, and get all your papers in on time.
GUBBIN:
You mean those funny little papers with pictures of the king on ’em?
DOROTHEE:
Anyway, the inspector has declared our building perfectly sound.
MARCE:
But… the foundation…
DOROTHEE:
It turns out those weren’t actually cracks. No. Someone painted them on the walls.
GUBBIN:
Painted! You sure?
DOROTHEE:
Oh yes. It was still wet in places, even. Now, who would do such a thing? Hm?
GUBBIN:
Could have been anyone.
STAN:
Wait a minute…
DOROTHEE:
Mister Gurvasson, isn’t it? Lovely tavern, by the way. Very rustic, very down-to-earth.
GUBBIN:
Uh huh.
DOROTHEE:
Any idea who might want to delay our construction, Mister Gurvasson?
GUBBIN:
We at the Axe and Crown welcome new businesses to the neighbourhood. Competition fosters innovation and creativity.
DOROTHEE:
Oh, well said, Mister Gurvasson. It sounds like we have much in common.
GUBBIN:
Sure.
DOROTHEE:
All right, everyone. Unfortunately, we’re on a schedule and it seems you’re all in no state to return to work.
MARCE:
We didn’t figure the inspector would be out the same day.
DOROTHEE:
And unless I’m seriously misreading our contract with the Builders and Bricklayers’ Guild… I’m afraid that means you’re all docked a full day’s pay.
Muttering and grumbling. A couple of shouts of “What!”
DOROTHEA (CONT’D)
And, well, I’m not pointing any fingers, but if it turned out that someone on this crew had painted those cracks, I hope the Guild would take appropriate steps.
MARCE:
Nobody on my crew would ever do such a thing.
Consternation amongst the crew. “What about the troll?” “Yeah!”
BETULE:
What about “the troll”? You think I had something to do with this?
The crew retreat. “Nothing’s wrong with trolls, really…” “My dentist is a troll.”
DOROTHEE:
My, look at you. What’s your name, dear?
BETULE:
Betula. Anna Betula Erfydsdottir.
DOROTHEE:
Any relation to Mister Gurvasson?
BETULE:
What, just because we’re both trolls, you think we’re related?
MARCE:
She’s his niece.
BETULE:
Oh, thanks.
DOROTHEE:
I see. And how long have you been with the Guild?
BETULE:
Two days.
DOROTHEE:
Really! How interesting.
MARCE:
She’s just apprenticing. This is her first job with the Guild.
DOROTHEE:
You didn’t look into her background?
BETULE:
What background?
MARCE:
She had a letter of reference from Stanway Gerrard—that’s Carlton Gerrard’s kid. Doesn’t get much bigger than that in this business.
DOROTHEE:
You know that the young Mister Gerrard was all but disowned by his father.
MARCE:
Uh…
DOROTHEE:
Yes, the only thing he inherited was this tavern.
MARCE:
You’re kidding. This place?
DOROTHEE:
Yes. In fact… that’s him right there.
STAN:
Uh, hi!
MARCE:
What? That’s Stanway Gerrard?
DOROTHEE:
Well, I’d say it’s fairly obvious how this all played out. Mister Krabchov, it sounds like your Guild has been duped by a scheming landlord and tavernkeeper into hiring a saboteur.
STAN:
Scheming—wait, you mean me? Why would I want to sabotage…
BETULE:
I had nothing to do with this! You can’t just assume because we’re related…
DOROTHEE:
I’d say the evidence is quite conclusive.
BETULE:
I’d say my fist punching your face through the back of your head will be “quite conclusive”.
STAN:
Whoa, whoa! Betula!
DOROTHEE:
Mister Krabchov?
MARCE:
Yeah, we, uh… the Grandville Guild of Builders and Bricklayers extends its sincere apologies for this incident, and wishes it known that Miss Betula Erfydsdottir is no longer in our employ.
BETULE:
Marco. You know I didn’t do it.
MARCE:
You just threatened to punch our client!
BETULE:
She deserved it!
DOROTHEE:
Well, now! As lovely as this has been, I’d best get back to the office. Oh, silly me. I almost forgot! This fellow asked me to deliver this.
She unfolds a piece of paper.
GUBBIN:
What fellow?
DOROTHEE:
“Bulletin from the Royal Building Inspector, County Grandville… all buildings between Harbour Street and the river’s edge require immediate inspection to ensure the soundness of their foundations, and must be closed to the public effective immediately.”
GUBBIN:
What?! Where’s this Inspector?
DOROTHEE:
Oh, now I’m afraid he’s long gone. He’s such a busy fellow, you know. You’ll have to go to the town hall. Let’s see here… “Request for inspection may be filed, dah dah dah… inspection will take place four to six weeks after booking.”
STAN:
Four to six weeks?!
DOROTHEE:
I know. The bureaucracy in this town is simply unbearable. I’m so glad our building’s already been declared sound. Yes, twice over, now! I suppose this emergency inspection today was something of a blessing in disguise, wasn’t it?
(to the workers)
I’m so sorry, everyone. You’re going to have to evacuate this tavern.
STAN:
Wait!
GUBBIN:
Gods dammit.
The grumbling workers head for the door.
DOROTHEE:
In the meantime, I have some vouchers! Yes, they’re good for fifteen percent off drinks and lodging at the Flounder and Bucket…
GUBBIN:
Oh, don’t you dare.
DOROTHEE:
Or the Buck and Bucket on Saddlehorn Lane.
BETULE:
Go on, get out of here, you phoney cow.
DOROTHEE:
But do drink responsibly! We need you all back on site and ready to work at eight-thirty tomorrow morning. Right, Mister Krabchov?
MARCE:
Yes, Ma’am.
DOROTHEE:
Have a lovely day. Ta ta!
Dorothea leaves. The workers all start to shuffle out.
GUBBIN:
All right. Now it’s war.
MARCE:
Well, so long, Betula. Gubbin. Thanks for nothin’.
He leaves too. The door slams.
STAN:
I can’t believe it.
GUBBIN:
What? Don’t look at me.
BETULE:
You lost me my job. You and your “war.”
GUBBIN:
It’s her! It’s that woman, Dorothea. Trying to open up a Bucket pub on our street!
BETULE:
Yeah, across from a tavern run by a lunatic.
GUBBIN:
We’re gonna show her.
BETULE:
So. When you reopen…
STAN:
If we ever reopen.
BETULE:
Yeah. Think you’ll need a cook?
GUBBIN:
(beat)
Yeah, you know any?

"E9: Selected Shades of Pink","MUSIC—OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Nine: Selected Shades of Pink.
INT. BAR—MORNINE:
Stan leafs through the newspaper.
STAN:
Uh… “Nannies wanted.”
BETULE:
Maybe if I knew the first thing about human babies.
STAN:
Oh, hey, “Mysticorp Energy—now hiring workers for new headquarters.” Oh wait, sorry, that one’s construction too.
BETULE:
Yeah, and I’m blacklisted from every guild in town.
STAN:
Right. Well, maybe next week.
BETULE:
I can’t believe Uncle lost me my job.
STAN:
Really?
BETULE:
I can totally believe Uncle lost me my job.
STAN:
That’s more like it. Well, you can help me clean up around here. Pass me that tankard.
She does. He starts washing up.
BETULE:
(sighs, then)
So. How’s things with your girlfriend?
STAN:
Well… she’s not exactly—she’s—I mean—we’re not… Girlfriend, that’s such a social construct, you know? Is she a girl who is also a friend? Is she a friend who is a girl? Shut up, Stan. Right? I’m shutting up now. That’s what I’m doing.
BETULE:
Does this vixen who stole your sanity have a name?
STAN:
Aura. Her name is Aura.
BETULE:
Uh huh. Is she cute?
STAN:
Yeah. Aw shucks. She has this way of pouting when she’s angry. These little dimples just form right here. It sort of actually makes me want to upset her. Is that wrong?
BETULE:
Sounds like she’s got you right where she wants you.
STAN:
Oh yeah. Totally. And you should see her hair—- redder than an ogre’s cheeks. And she has these gossamer wings that you wouldn’t think would hold her up, at least I didn’t think so. And then she dresses in all black. Very mysterious. And, you know, her choice in makeup is a little unusual, but it’s cool. You know? She’s cool.
BETULE:
Wings, huh?
STAN:
Yeah. I know, right? And a tattoo!
BETULE:
You don’t say.
STAN:
Right on her…
(whispers)
That place where her pixie wings meet her lower back.
BETULE:
You’re dating a pixie?
STAN:
I mean, I haven’t actually, you know, asked her out yet. But aside from that small, insignificant technicality…
BETULE:
Still. I’m happy for you, Stan.
STAN:
Thanks. Me too.
Stan goes on washing the tankards.
STAN (CONT’D)
You know, I was sort of upset when you didn’t come back.
BETULE:
Yeah. I know. I’m sorry.
STAN:
I really like you, Betula. And…
BETULE:
I like you too, Stan. Just not as a boyfriend.
STAN:
No, I know. I get it. But you know, maybe I could be just your friend, who happens to be a boy. Or the other way around. That works too.
BETULE:
Yeah. I’d like that. Friends.
STAN:
Woo hoo! And we can totally help each other out with advice on girls. And guys! I do know a thing or two about guys, you know.
BETULE:
I’ll take your word for it.
STAN:
Oh! Oh! We can go shopping together! I am the best at picking out tunic embroidery patterns.
BETULE:
How about just trading advice for now?
STAN:
Right. Good idea. Like—hey! Brain explosion! How do I ask out Aura? Do you know much about pixies?
BETULE:
Well… don’t tell Gubbin, but I may have dated one.
STAN:
What! How perfect is this? See, we’re sharing! Best friends ever! What was his name?
BETULE:
She. Her name was Luciola.
STAN:
Her… what?
BETULE:
It was back in college. I’d never been outside Trølsund, so I’d never met pixies before. Whew… she was a firecracker.
STAN:
Say! Look at how dirty these tankards are.
BETULE:
You don’t want to hear about it? Oh. Is this one of those human double vision things?
STAN:
What? Oh, you mean double standard. No, no, it’s not one of those.
BETULE:
Uh huh.
STAN:
No, no. It’s totally cool. So cool that I can’t even tell you how cool, because the telling you of the coolness would not itself be cool.
BETULE:
Right.
He returns to washing.
STAN:
How would you even kiss? Wait… did she fly? Or would you have to crouch down? How… Oh, hey Gubbin!
Gubbin enters the bar.
GUBBIN:
Stan. Betula.
BETULE:
What’s in the bag?
GUBBIN:
Huh? This? Nothing. Just mind your own business. Aren’t there dishes to do or something?
STAN:
All done! Betula helped! What have you been up to?
GUBBIN:
Oh. Nothing, just out and about.
BETULE:
You don’t do “out”. Or “about”.
STAN:
Yeah… What were you doing outside?
GUBBIN:
What is this, the Mellurian inquisition?
STAN:
Just asking. Oh! Did you see the big hoarding they put up last night across the street last night?
GUBBIN:
Hard to miss.
STAN:
Betula and I were trying to figure out what they were working on. I think it’s a third storey!
GUBBIN:
Don’t know, don’t care. I want that woman and her make-believe bar off my street.
STAN:
What, you mean Dorothea? She’s actually really nice once you get to know her.
GUBBIN:
Oh, so you’re buddies now? Surprise, surprise.
STAN:
Dorothea’s got big plans. Even beyond the Badger and Bucket. Did you know she’s forming an alliance of all the businesses along this side of the river? I told her we’d join. We just have to clean up a few things.
GUBBIN:
I knew it. She’s taking over.
STAN:
No. It’s to build community, improve the neighbourhood… That’s what the the ELBO District Coalition is all about.
BETULE:
Elbow District?
STAN:
That’s the name of this neighbourhood.
GUBBIN:
Thought it was called “Mud Street”.
STAN:
It stands for East of the Lookout Bridge Overpass.
BETULE:
And the W stands for…?
STAN:
There’s no W. It’s just E‑L-B‑O.
GUBBIN:
See, they can’t even spell.
STAN:
You guys are missing the point. ELBO is about renewal. Breathing new life into a beloved old neighbourhood.
GUBBIN:
Ooo, look at the developer talk. I see why you like her.
STAN:
Look, we just want to make the neighbourhood nicer.
GUBBIN:
See, that’s the problem. You make a place “nice” and suddenly people want to live here…
STAN:
Oh. Goodness. People. Gosh. Don’t want any of those living here.
GUBBIN:
And the nicer it gets, the more they want to come here. And they start trying to outbid each other. Until only the rich people can afford to live in the nice place and everyone else gets sent packing. That is what’s wrong with “nice”.
BETULE:
What do they mean by renewal? What do they actually do?
STAN:
Well, one, they’re lobbying the mayor for more town guards in the area to crack down on illegal activities.
GUBBIN:
Illegal activities? Right here in the “ELBO”? Surely you jest.
STAN:
No, it’s rife with crime! There’s muggings, there’s graffiti… yesterday some guy tried to sell me spiked gingerbread. And “crennies”, I think? I have no idea what those even are.
BETULE:
They’re crenulated spirits. They’re this alchemical thing. Back in school, people used to take ’em when they were studying for exams.
STAN:
Oh yeah, those! You literally like, speed up, right?
BETULE:
Right. Well, I don’t.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, sure, you’d never partake.
BETULE:
I’m too big. The smaller you are, the more it speeds you up. Heh… when Luciola took them she was pretty much in three places at once and…
STAN:
Well! Anyway. That’s one thing we won’t have to worry about if Dorothea gets her way.
GUBBIN:
Every mayor that comes in says they’re gonna clean up the streets.
STAN:
Yeah, but the ELBO District Coalition is serious. And get this—they’re going to offer money to places that want to renovate…
GUBBIN:
And they’ll be charging how many hundred percent in interest?
STAN:
Their rates aren’t that bad. But they do have to raise money to pay for all the improvements. As Dorothea says, “Membership has its privileges. And its dues.” Here.
Stan produces a flyer.
GUBBIN:
Is this for real?
STAN:
See, members get discounts from local suppliers. Look at this—half price on pink paint from Squigley’s Pigments!
GUBBIN:
Just what we need.
BETULE:
Yeah, that sounds very you, Uncle. Why only pink paint?
STAN:
Well, there was this decree for the Queen’s big birthday celebration. Every building within sight of the Palace had to be painted in royally approved shades of pink.
GUBBIN:
That was months ago.
STAN:
Right, but it’s still in force. A direct decree from the Palace, and you do not want to mess with the Bailiff’s Office. The fine for having an off-colour building is still four hundred crowns.
BETULE:
Four hundred?
GUBBIN:
It was a pretty expensive birthday party.
BETULE:
(scoffs)
Queens.
STAN:
But with the discount, the paint should only run us about seventy-five.
(he turns over the flyer)
I’m thinking maybe the Salmon Sunrise would look good. Or Flustered Flamingo.
BETULE:
Ooh. I kind of like Iced Raspberry.
STAN:
That might clash with our sign. What about the Presumptuous Coral?
GUBBIN:
Uh. No. No painting. We’re not within sight. You can’t even see the Palace until you’re halfway down River Street.
STAN:
But the discount!
GUBBIN:
No painting. No pink!
From outside comes the sound of wood splintering and giving way with a massive crash. Betula and Stan rush to the window.
STAN:
Whoa!
BETULE:
Kriispar flekkin! What was that?
GUBBIN:
Uh. No idea.
BETULE:
The new hoarding across the street just fell down.
STAN:
Oh my gosh! Is anyone hurt?
GUBBIN:
‘Course no one’s hurt. It’s Sunday. No one on site.
BETULE:
What about the security guard?
GUBBIN:
He’s probably around the other side of the building.
BETULE:
Probably!
STAN:
I’m gonna go check.
He rushes out.
BETULE:
What did you do, Uncle?
GUBBIN:
Nothing! I did nothing to that hoarding.
BETULE:
To the hoarding.
GUBBIN:
But on my way past, I did notice they got a big pitchwood beetle infestation. Serves them right for using cheap imported lumber.
BETULE:
You wouldn’t have anything to do with the sudden appearance of these beetles.
GUBBIN:
They’re there naturally! Pretty much any piece of pitchwood in the world is full of ’em. There’s just no way you can stop them, just slow them down.
BETULE:
Or speed them up.
GUBBIN:
Now why would someone want to do that?
Stan returns.
STAN:
It’s okay, no one’s hurt. But the hoarding all fell down… and you guys are not gonna believe what was behind it.
BETULE:
Try us.
They all peer out the window.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, let’s see. Wait, they took all the walls off.
STAN:
Exactly! The Badger and Bucket is the first of a new concept in patio pubs! The entire bar is a patio! It’s like having a pie without the crust! And then icing on top of where the crust would be! And ice cream put on top of the icing—
GUBBIN:
A patio. That’s it?
STAN:
This was totally my idea. But so much cooler!
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Great minds think alike.
STAN:
But who would build the hoarding so rickety that it would just come crashing down like that? Someone could have been killed!
BETULE:
Yeah, Uncle. Who indeed?
GUBBIN:
I dunno. And in my neighbourhood, too. Stan, you better alert the Armpit Coalition.
STAN:
ELBO.
GUBBIN:
Shameful.
BETULE:
I’ll say. Causing damage, giving illicit potions to the pitchwood beetles…
STAN:
Giving the what to the what?
GUBBIN:
I have no idea what she’s on about.
BETULE:
Every board in that hoarding is full of beetles, apparently. So what would happen if you, I don’t know, let’s say, fed those beetles crenulated spirits?
GUBBIN:
Preposterous.
STAN:
They’d probably go nuts and eat everything. Wait. You think that’s what happened?
BETULE:
I have my suspicions.
STAN:
But who would do a thing like that?
BETULE:
(clears her throat)
STAN:
Gubbin! No. You didn’t. You didn’t. Did you? You didn’t!
GUBBIN:
I can neither confirm nor deny any involvement in such things…
STAN:
Oh… geez! What if they finish eating all the hoarding, and they’re still hungry? Did you think of that? What if they come over here looking for more?
GUBBIN:
Nah. These are oak beams. They wouldn’t touch ’em! And pitchwood beetles like it dry. They’re not gonna cross all that mud.
BETULE:
See? Nothing to worry about. Uncle’s got it all worked out.
There’s another huge crash from across the street.
BETULA (CONT’D)
Yup.
GUBBIN:
Now what?
STAN:
Oh my gosh.
BETULE:
That was the old shack next to the Badger and Bucket.
STAN:
I’ll be right back.
He heads out again.
BETULE:
So. Do you figure it was made of pitchwood too?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Probably.
BETULE:
You don’t sound so sure this time.
GUBBIN:
Uh, I’m just hoping no one got injured.
BETULE:
Well, why don’t you go out and help Stan check?
GUBBIN:
I think maybe I’ll get a pail and go wet down the mud in front of our place, just to be on the safe side, you know?
As he does, Stan returns.
STAN:
So, good news… Looks like no one was in there. And it’s vacant too. The bad news is, the beetles are still on the move.
BETULE:
Nice one, Uncle.
STAN:
But the other good news is, between the two, we’ve got an amazing view!
GUBBIN:
Oh! Whoa!
STAN:
Look, you can see the north shore, and then all the way up to the palace.
Pause.
GUBBIN:
Ohhh, dammit.
BETULE:
The palace, huh?
STAN:
So the other other good news…
GUBBIN:
Uh, fifty percent off pink paint?
STAN:
If we join.
GUBBIN:
Ugh.
BETULE:
So. Salmon, or Flustered Flamingo?

The Axe and Crown. Episode Ten: Grand Opening.
INT. BAR—DAE:
Stan comes in from the street. Gubbin is pushing a wheelbarrow through from the basement stairs to the back door, and actually humming to himself.
STAN:
Hey Betula!
BETULE:
Hi Stan.
STAN:
Hey Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
Hey.
STAN:
Wow, you should see what they’ve done across the street.
GUBBIN:
What, at the Badger and Bucket? Somehow I doubt they’re letting trolls in the front door.
BETULE:
They aren’t.
STAN:
I know, I know. But I wish you guys could see it. They really went all out for their grand opening.
GUBBIN:
Eh. Good for them.
STAN:
The decor—brilliant. All the furniture’s got that rough wood panel kind of a look, to go with the “bucket” idea…
GUBBIN:
Yeah, yeah. I’ve seen Bucket pubs before. They’re all the same.
Gubbin heads out the back door.
STAN:
(calling after him)
But the Badger and Bucket’s got the patio!
(back to Betula)
Plus the furniture’s all wood reclaimed from an old ship. Dorothea gave me a grand tour!
BETULE:
Are you still all chummy with her?
STAN:
Yeah! But only to observe and figure out their weaknesses.
BETULE:
And…? What are their weaknesses?
STAN:
Right. Right. I will get back to you on that. Such a sweet building though. I love those big tall warehouse ceilings.
Gubbin reappears.
STAN (CONT’D)
Hey Gubbin, do you think we could raise the ceilings in here somehow?
GUBBIN:
Raise them?
STAN:
Yeah. I mean, since we’re doing so much work on the building…
GUBBIN:
Short of taking out the floor above us… no.
STAN:
Oh. What if we take out that floor… and put it on top of the building?
GUBBIN:
Thank the gods you were never an engineer.
STAN:
You know, I kinda wish I was now! The bathrooms at the Badger and Bucket are so amazing. With the running water and everything… Gubbin, you remember toilettis?
Gubbin stops in his tracks.
GUBBIN:
Remember what?
STAN:
Those fancy Mellurian style toilets that Betula was telling us about? They’ve got ’em at the Badger and Bucket. A whole room of them!
GUBBIN:
Yup.
STAN:
You pull this lever thing and it’s like, whoosh! It cleans itself.
GUBBIN:
Yeah. That’s why they had to tear up the street last week, so they could hook up their stupid pipes.
STAN:
Hey, it’s not like we were open for business anyway.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, it was sure nice of Dorothea to hold off on her digging until after she had closed us down.
He heads downstairs.
STAN:
Why is Gubbin still working on the basement?
BETULE:
It’s the foundation, he says.
STAN:
But he said it was perfectly sound, like, a week ago. What’s left to do to it?
BETULE:
I guess he’s just extra paranoid. Oh, did he tell you? The town building inspector’s finally coming today.
STAN:
Whaaaat! No, that’s awesome. We can finally get the Axe and Crown un-condemned and back in business!
BETULE:
Well, if we’re lucky.
STAN:
I can’t wait. I have got so many ideas. Did you know the Badger and Bucket has a dozen kinds of beer?
BETULE:
Yeah. I saw all the barrels coming in yesterday.
STAN:
More than a dozen!
BETULE:
Why so many?
STAN:
There’s all different flavours. There’s Balgomarian ale with cinnamon and prunes… pine-infused cheesecake lager.
BETULE:
Yum.
STAN:
And the food, oh man!
BETULE:
(alarmed)
You ate the food?
STAN:
Yeah! Dorothea was handing out free samples.
BETULE:
I told you not to!
STAN:
What, were you worried she was going to try to poison me?
BETULE:
Or something like that.
STAN:
Nah, there was nothing wrong with it. She was eating all the same food herself!
BETULE:
(not relieved)
Oh… well. That’s a relief. You sure you’re feeling all right?
STAN:
Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. Just a little full. Gosh, the desserts. I was thinking we should have a dessert menu…
Gubbin re-emerges from the basement.
GUBBIN:
Menu?
STAN:
Oh, uh, well…
GUBBIN:
No. Stan. No.
STAN:
Maybe just a couple of additions? The Badger and Bucket have these awesome puff pastry things with jam in them…
GUBBIN:
It took our “cook” a month to learn not to burn steak to a crisp. How well do you think she’s gonna do at doing a croquembouche? Huh?
BETULE:
Gee, thanks, Uncle.
STAN:
Or they have these special fried turnip things called “frites”.
GUBBIN:
Just admit it. You’re still all goo-goo for that Dorothea.
STAN:
Her? No way! She got us shut down and forced us to repaint!
GUBBIN:
Uh huh. You’re always over there talking to her.
He heads out the back door.
STAN:
Yeah, that’s because we have a professional rivalry. We can totally steal all her good ideas.
(burps)
Oof. Excuse me. Geez! I really ate too much over there.
BETULE:
Stan.
STAN:
I know, I know, you told me not to. So? I’m a little bloated!
BETULE:
And soon you’re going to be nauseous, and then you’re going to be… emptying out.
STAN:
What makes you say that?
BETULE:
Have you noticed the people leaving the Badger and Bucket?
Stan peers out the window.
STAN:
What about them? Oh yeah, they don’t look too happy! Hey, I wonder why…
BETULE:
Because they ate something bad.
STAN:
Well, they don’t look sick.
(with feigned innocence)
I wonder if something went wrong with the toilettis…
BETULE:
Well… what about that guy?
STAN:
Okay, maybe that guy looks sick. Ooo, and she’s kinda doubled over. Aw man, maybe something is wrong with the food!
BETULE:
Little bit. Little bit.
STAN:
Oh gods. Do you think I should go see a doctor?
BETULE:
It shouldn’t be that bad.
Stan makes for the front door as Gubbin comes back in.
STAN:
You never know with these things. I think I’m feeling faint.
GUBBIN:
What’s the matter, kid? Competition stressing you out?
STAN:
We think some of the food today was off.
GUBBIN:
Serves you right for eating there.
STAN:
I should probably go to the House of Healing before this gets worse.
BETULE:
I don’t know if you have to go that far. It should pass pretty quickly.
STAN:
You said “emptying out”! That sounds serious to me.
BETULE:
It’s because of the kombonchi.
STAN:
The what?
BETULE:
In all the Bucket pubs, they use this goo made from seaweed to enhance the flavour in everything. So they can use cheapass ingredients, and then just add kombonchi to make it taste good.
STAN:
Uh oh. Do we use it?
BETULE:
Nah, Uncle won’t let me.
GUBBIN:
Johann would never touch the stuff.
BETULE:
Yeah, well, I’m not a fancy chef like Johann.
STAN:
So how do the Bucket pubs get away with using ko-badgey if it makes people sick?
BETULE:
Oh, it’s usually fine… unless you happen to get a bad batch.
STAN:
Betula! Did you…?
BETULE:
I may have.
GUBBIN:
May have poisoned a whole pub full of people?
BETULE:
Not poisoned! Just gave them a bit of gastric distress.
GUBBIN:
(laughs)
All right! That’s my niece! Nice going, kid.
STAN:
I don’t think any of this is funny!
GUBBIN:
How’d you manage it?
BETULE:
I know some people in the food supply business. I’m surprised you didn’t try to pull a stunt like that for their grand opening.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, I say, let them have their moment.
BETULE:
Come on. What have you really been doing this week? You’re up to something too.
GUBBIN:
Just a little below-ground infrastructure project.
BETULE:
On the foundation… Wait. No. You’re digging a tunnel.
GUBBIN:
A ventilation shaft.
BETULE:
Ha! Does this ventilation shaft happen to run directly across the street to the Badger and Bucket?
GUBBIN:
It may have an exit in that general direction.
STAN:
Gubbin! Aren’t they going to notice a hole in their basement?
GUBBIN:
Nah. It runs most of the way under the street, and then for the last five feet it’s just a tiny little tube. Angles up, then connects to their drain. They’ll never suspect that’s where the cockroaches are getting in.
BETULE:
You put cockroaches in their basement?
GUBBIN:
No. Not yet. I’ll wait until we get the Axe and Crown open again so their disgruntled patrons can come over here.
STAN:
Ughhh…
BETULE:
Stan, you’re not looking too good.
STAN:
Too much kobatchney.
BETULE:
I’m sorry, Stan. I tried to warn you.
STAN:
That’s okay…
GUBBIN:
Why don’t you use their fancy bathroom across the street? It was their food you ate.
STAN:
No, I can’t do that. The toilettis are all blocked up.
BETULE:
Oh yeah! Everyone must be lining up to use them.
STAN:
Well, also… the pipes are frozen.
GUBBIN:
Oh yeah?
BETULE:
Frozen?
STAN:
Yeah. See, at the bar, they were using these little alchemical gizmos to make ice. You just drop one in water, and a few minutes later you’ve got a solid block. So I thought, I wonder what would happen if you flushed a couple of these?
BETULE:
Stan!
GUBBIN:
You froze the pipes.
STAN:
Yup.
GUBBIN:
The pipes that carry sewage down to the sewer.
STAN:
Yup.
GUBBIN:
Causing them to back up hilariously into the Badger and Bucket.
STAN:
Yup.
BETULE:
Which is now connected to our basement.
GUBBIN:
Oh crap.
Gubbin rushes downstairs.
STAN:
Pretty good, eh? Excuse me.
GUBBIN:
(from below)
Augh! Dammit! Stan! Betula! Get down here!
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR—LATEE:
STAN:
Well. This has been a learning experience.
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Not words I would use, but yeah, it has, hasn’t it? Let’s see. What exactly have we learned?
STAN:
Well, on the plus side, there is a big untapped market for pubs in this area.
BETULE:
And we learned that ice expands when it freezes.
STAN:
Also, toilettis use a lot of water.
GUBBIN:
Uh huh.
BETULE:
Also, it’s hard to hide an illegal “ventilation shaft” that’s leaking sewage into your basement.
STAN:
Yeah. At least the inspector gave us a firm date for a return visit.
BETULE:
Assuming Dorothea doesn’t manage to get that delayed somehow.
STAN:
But at least that’ll give us some time for the smell to go down!
GUBBIN:
Yeah, yeah. Most importantly, though, what?
STAN:
Most importantly, we learned… the value of friendship! Bring it in. Bring it in.
BETULE:
Believing in yourself!
STAN:
That the things we have in common are more important than the things that set us apart!
GUBBIN:
No, what we learned is, in future, if either of you two want to pull a prank on the neighbours, you ask me first!
BETULE:
Right.
STAN:
That sounds good. Right. Yes.
Silence.
BETULE:
It was pretty good though, wasn’t it?
STAN:
I mean, the Bucket had to close down for almost as long as we did!
GUBBIN:
Yeah, it could have gone worse!
STAN:
Go team Axe and Crown!
They all cheer.
STAN (CONT’D)
(burps)
Oh. Excuse me.
GUBBIN:
Ugh. Take that outside.

MUSIC—OPENING THEME:
ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Eleven: Bowled Over.
INT. BAR—AFTERNOON:
Gubbin is stacking bricks at one end of the room. Betula enters from the street.
BETULE:
Hey, Uncle. What’s with all the bricks? Did Stan finally talk you into putting up a fifth storey?
GUBBIN:
It’s for siege bowling. Didn’t you see the posters?
BETULE:
Oh yeah, something about a tournament?
GUBBIN:
Hundred-crown prize.
BETULE:
Never heard of siege bowling.
GUBBIN:
It’s a big pub sport here in town. Back in the army my buddies and me used to play it on our off hours.
BETULE:
It’s bowling? Like, with a ball?
GUBBIN:
Yeah… So. Listen. You used to play smashball, right?
BETULE:
Oh yeah. Left striker.
GUBBIN:
You any good?
BETULE:
We were three-time All-Trølsund champions.
GUBBIN:
Hmm.
BETULE:
Any particular reason you ask?
GUBBIN:
Well… we’re down a guy from last year, so it’s just Hank and me. We need a third bowler.
BETULE:
What’s in it for me?
GUBBIN:
Glory, achievement…
BETULE:
A share of the prize money?
GUBBIN:
Commensurate with experience.
BETULE:
Pfff. Equal share or I’m out.
GUBBIN:
We’ll see.
BETULE:
How’s the game work?
GUBBIN:
It’s head to head. Each team builds a wall out of bricks. That’s your castle.
BETULE:
And then the other team has to knock it down?
Gubbin goes back to setting up bricks and pegs as he talks.
GUBBIN:
Little more complicated. Basic idea is, your king is being held prisoner in the other team’s castle. Each bowler gets one throw, and between you, trying to knock down these five pegs. Those are the guards. Your opponents set those up, along with the wall, plus this coin here…
He sets down a big coin.
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
That’s your king. You knock that down, you score zero for that castle.
BETULE:
Got it. Sounds pretty straightforward so far.
GUBBIN:
That’s the basics. You throw from the line back here. So with this layout I’d go for the two guards on the left—
Betula has already thrown. The ball rumbles across the floor and smashes into the bricks.
BETULE:
You were saying?
GUBBIN:
Well. Okay. First time lucky.
BETULE:
So… equal shares.
GUBBIN:
Hang on. We’ve only covered the official rules.
BETULE:
There are unofficial rules?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. One: cheat like hell. Two: don’t get caught.
BETULE:
Okay, now this is sounding like your kind of game.
Stan enters from the street.
STAN:
Hey guys! Are you joining the siege bowling team, Betula?
BETULE:
Thinking about it.
STAN:
Oh, you gotta be on it! You’ll be awesome.
BETULE:
Are you playing too?
STAN:
Gubbin says I’m banned from the team for life.
GUBBIN:
Damn straight.
BETULE:
That have anything to do with the hole in the wall by the stairs?
STAN:
It may perhaps.
GUBBIN:
There’s also the matter of Stan being terrible at lying.
STAN:
Yeah, either that—or the best liar ever.
GUBBIN:
Oho. So who told the building inspector about our basement tunnel?
STAN:
Well, he couldn’t figure out where the smell was coming from and he just looked so bothered about it.
GUBBIN:
And where were you just now, Stan?
STAN:
I was… not across the street.
GUBBIN:
So, not at the Badger and Bucket.
STAN:
Yes. I was so not at the Badger and Bucket.
BETULE:
I believe you.
STAN:
See, Betula believes me.
GUBBIN:
Once again, across the street and in bed with the enemy.
STAN:
In bed! Whatever! I was there to gain intelligence. Is that so hard to believe?
GUBBIN:
Well, I doubt you could lose any.
STAN:
Hey, which reminds me… They’re fielding a team in the tournament.
GUBBIN:
They’re what?
STAN:
The siege bowling. They’re gonna compete!
GUBBIN:
The Badger and Bucket are?
STAN:
Yeah. I told them they’re gonna be toast! I bet Dorothea a hundred crowns we would win.
GUBBIN:
Whoa. You got a hundred crowns just lying around?
STAN:
I mean, not exactly… But we are gonna win, right?
GUBBIN:
Sure. Well. This ought to be interesting.
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR—NIGHE:
A raucous crowd awaits the next game.
STAN:
Is everybody having fun?
The crowd cheers.
STAN (CONT’D)
I can’t hear you. I said, is everybody having fun?!
The crowd cheers louder.
STAN (CONT’D)
It’s time for Game Two of the quarter-final round, my friends. From the Tower District, put your hands together for last year’s fifth-place team from Ye Olde Pointed Hat!
Applause.
STAN (CONT’D)
Bowling first, it’s Vanevender Piffling! Bowling second: Maisie Wulfenschnaut. Am I saying that right? Okay, cool. Bowling third: Tempesma Chang!
BETULE:
Are they actual wizards?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. They got no chance. Wizards are crap at siege bowling.
BETULE:
You’d figure they’d be great at cheating.
GUBBIN:
You can always tell. They’re worse liars than Stan and they can’t hold their beer.
STAN:
And squaring off against them, a brand new team on the scene—nice place but you wouldn’t want to drink there… it’s the Badger and Bucket! BOOOO.
Mingled boos and applause.
GUBBIN:
All right. Let’s see what kind of team these clowns can field.
STAN:
Bowling first, from Fair-Upon-Middling in Mediocria, it’s Zenda Bland! Oh yeah, actually, she tends bar! She’s really nice.
Bowling second, hometown boy Spike Macduff!
And bowling third, team captain and former bowler for the Axe and Crown…?
He trails off. A hush falls. Astonished gasps.
GUBBIN:
Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me.
STAN:
Johann… Yeoman?
GUBBIN:
Son of a…!
BETULE:
Uncle… is that your Johann?
GUBBIN:
He’s not “my” anything. Those bastards.
STAN:
Now, hang on. Judges? Correct me if I’m wrong, but shouldn’t this man be disqualified? For… cheating?
GUBBIN:
Okay, Stan.
STAN:
As in, cheating on another player in this tournament.
GUBBIN:
Stan.
STAN:
Specifically, cheating on his former teammate for the Axe and Crown, Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
You made your point.
An awkward silence.
JOHANN:
I’m just here to play, guys.
STAN:
Okay. Uh… great! So. Let’s get this game underway. Team captains, to the bar for the toss, please.
(whispers)
Guys! They stole our chef! And Gubbin’s ex!
GUBBIN:
I noticed.
The teams flip a coin.
STAN:
And it is The Badger and Bucket to bowl first. Pointed Hat, please proceed to your battlefield and assemble your wall!
BETULE:
How much does Johann know about our… setup?
GUBBIN:
He knows the bendy floorboard, and the wind vent. And he’s the one who invented the “hollow brick full of sand” trick.
BETULE:
Well, maybe you can spot some of his tricks, at least.
GUBBIN:
If it comes to that. Let’s hope the wizards can take ’em down before they get into the final.
MUSIC STINE:
A ball takes out several more bricks. A peg tumbles to the floor. The crowd is not pleased.
STAN:
And down goes the third guard! The Badger and Bucket are the winners, with seventy-six points to forty.
GUBBIN:
Frickin’ wizards!
MUSIC STINE:
The crowd chants “Axe and Crown! Axe and Crown!” Gubbin throws and bricks and pegs tumble. The crowd cheers.
GUBBIN:
Yes!
STAN:
That’s the last two guards down. Oh, what a beautiful shot! That brings it to sixty-five points for the Axe and Crown, who advance to the semi-finals versus the Parson’s Trousers—
BOWLEE:
Wait! Wait. Time out! I saw some kinda string attached to the guard on the left, there!
Disgruntled noises.
GUBBIN:
A string? Why would you attach a string to your own wall?
BOWLEE:
We didn’t! It was you guys! You… cheating people.
GUBBIN:
We were right over here. Did we move? Did any of you see us move past the line? No.
MUSIC STINE:
The ball connects, knocking down bricks, pegs and coin. Groans.
STAN:
Augh! Down goes the crown. Zero points. A heartbreaker for the Hippopotamus and Castle. Don’t feel bad, guys. I have no idea how, but the Badger and Bucket were totally cheating, I know it.
MUSIC STINE:
The audience are hopping mad.
BETULE:
You heard the judges. They didn’t see any glue on the bricks. It was just a fluke, plain and simple.
STAN:
The judges are shrugging. They’ve reached a decision and… yes! The Axe and Crown take it, to advance to the finals! Yeah!
Cheering.
MUSIC STINE:
The crowd is hushed.
STAN:
It all comes down to this one, ladies and gentlemen. The final game of this year’s Grandville Pub League Siege Bowling Championship pits our upstart challengers, the Badger and Bucket, against reigning champions for four years running—The Axe and Crown!
Cheers.
STAN (CONT’D)
Team captains, please come to the bar for the toss. Gubbin, would you be so kind?
JOHANN:
It’s good to see you, Gubbin.
The coin flies across the room. Laughter.
GUBBIN:
Dammit.
STAN:
Uh… let’s try that again.
JOHANN:
Take your time.
GUBBIN:
Jackass.
He flips the coin again, and catches it this time.
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
Call it.
JOHANN:
(suggestively)
Hmm… Tails.
A long pause.
STAN:
Gubbin?
GUBBIN:
(snapping out of his reverie)
Uh… right. Heads.
STAN:
So it’s the Axe and Crown to bowl first. Badger and Bucket, to the battlefield please! Stack ’em up! Stack ’em up, like groceries. Yeah! See what I did there?
MUSIC STINE:
Betula throws. Bricks smash, and a coin rolls across the floor. Great consternation among the audience.
BETULE:
Dammit!
STAN:
Oh no! The king is down on the first throw. That’s zero points for this round.
GUBBIN:
Come on! The middle brick went down before the ball even hit. You all saw it!
MUSIC STINE:
STAN:
All right. No score yet. The Axe and Crown are ready with their first castle. Let’s see if Johann’s team can deliver.
The Badger and Bucket make their first throw. Bricks and pegs fly. The crowd groans and Gubbin sputters incoherently.
MUSIC STINE:
The spectators are tense.
STAN:
Thirty-eight to thirty-five going into the last round! I don’t remember ever seeing a game this intense. And by the way, there totally were magnets in that top row last round.
Arguments break out in the crowd.
GUBBIN:
Okay, bring it in. This last one looks like a Blaflarney Castle formation. Aim for the second row, one in from the left.
BETULE:
You sure? Not the one beside?
GUBBIN:
No. That reddish one right above it, that’s not one of our bricks.
BETULE:
How do you know?
GUBBIN:
I’ve memorized every brick in the pile, okay? It’s gotta be one of Johann’s.
BETULE:
Okay. Second row, second from the left.
The Axe and Crown’s fans are chanting “Go Betula go! Go go go!” She winds up and throws. Bricks tumble, and a peg clinks to the floor. The crowd cheers.
STAN:
Guard number three is down! But that still leaves a nasty split. This could be tricky… Let’s see if Gubbin can take out those last two, and yes, by the way, he totally can.
GUBBIN:
All right, Bucket-heads.
JOHANN:
No pressure, Gubbin.
GUBBIN:
Can it.
Gubbin winds up. There’s a clunk and a splatter of beer from Johann’s side of the room.
JOHANN:
Oops! I seem to have dropped my tankard. How clumsy of me. Let me just get that.
He bends over, to whistles and catcalls.
GUBBIN:
Nice try, Johann.
STAN:
Oh, now look, that’s just playing dirty. Gubbin, don’t look. Don’t look, Gubbin. Yeah, we’re all onto you, Johann. You and all your sexy moves.
JOHANN:
And oh dear, the beer spilled all over my shirt.
GUBBIN:
(agitated)
All right, all right, all right. Time out. Time out!
JOHANN:
I’ll just take that off.
STAN:
The judges are signalling—oh no, that’s right, the Axe and Crown have used up their timeouts. Oh geez.
JOHANN:
You like?
STAN:
The clock is ticking… and… Johann has clearly been working out. Wow.
GUBBIN:
Put your damn shirt back on.
STAN:
Yeah, give it up, Johann. Shake those hips all you want.
The crowd claps in rhythm as Gubbin tries to get back on track.
JOHANN:
There’s more where that came from… if you make this shot.
GUBBIN:
(groans)
STAN:
Five seconds, Gubbin!
Gubbin throws. His shot connects, and cheering erupts.
GUBBIN:
Yeah!

Oh, my head.

The hell am I doing upstairs?
(then)
Oh.
The door opens.
JOHANN:
Room service!
GUBBIN:
What is all this?
JOHANN:
Breakfast in bed, silly. For the champion. I know, domplinka’s not really a breakfast food, but whatever.
GUBBIN:
You bastard.
JOHANN:
Yep. Here… hot off the grill.
He feeds Gubbin a bite.
GUBBIN:
Ohh. Damn. I will say, I’ve been missing these.
JOHANN:
Doesn’t your niece cook?
GUBBIN:
In the sense that she puts food on the stove and then puts the remains on a plate… yeah, she cooks.
JOHANN:
(laughs)
You poor baby.
GUBBIN:
The kid could really use some help.
JOHANN:
Maybe I can give her some pointers.
GUBBIN:
She’d probably appreciate it.
JOHANN:
Mm hmm. Coffee?
GUBBIN:
Oh yeah. Yeah.
He pours.
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
You know, sometimes it’s easy to take a good thing for granted.
JOHANN:
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Gubbin takes a sip.
GUBBIN:
This doesn’t mean you’re forgiven or anything.
JOHANN:
Didn’t cross my mind.
He pours himself a coffee too.
GUBBIN:
So. Working at the Badger and Bucket now?
JOHANN:
Well, for now. Assuming Dorothea doesn’t fire my ass for losing the tournament.
GUBBIN:
What, she hired you just to beat us at siege bowling?
JOHANN:
You think Bucket pubs hire cooks for their skill?
GUBBIN:
Eh, good point. Well, if she does fire you, you know…
JOHANN:
Yeah?
GUBBIN:
It’ll serve you right.
JOHANN:
(laughs)
Probably.
GUBBIN:
All right.
He takes another domplinka.
GUBBIN (CONT’D)
Did you lose that game on purpose?
JOHANN:
Of course not. The better man won.
GUBBIN:
You got that right.
JOHANN:
I mean, you always play fair, right, Gubbin?
GUBBIN:
Always.
JOHANN:
(laughs)
They clink their mugs.

ANNOUNCEE:
The Axe and Crown. Episode Twelve: The Art of War.
INT. BAR—NIGHE:
The bar is almost empty. Betula is putting the chairs up. Stan picks one up too.
STAN:
Hey Betula. I can help you with those.
BETULE:
No, Stan, let me do it. I’m stronger.
STAN:
I can lift a chair, geez. What’s the matter?
BETULE:
Nothing’s the matter.
(she lowers her voice)
That guy’s creeping me out.
STAN:
Which guy?
BETULE:
In the far corner? Watching everybody? No, don’t stare.
STAN:
Oh, with the little hat! He seemed nice.
BETULE:
Stan, you think I’m nice. You think my uncle is nice.
STAN:
Yeah! Well, you know, deep down…
BETULE:
Guy looks Meyurian. Did he have any kind of accent?
STAN:
I dunno. All he said was “A beer.”
BETULE:
Has he moved at all since he came in?
STAN:
Nah, he’s just been reading his book.
BETULE:
Pretty thin book.
STAN:
I guess he’s savouring it?
BETULE:
And he hasn’t touched his drink.
STAN:
He’s savouring that too?
BETULE:
It’s still full to the brim.
STAN:
Maybe he doesn’t drink?
BETULE:
Well, then, why order one?
STAN:
To support our business?
BETULE:
Right, because he’s nice.
STAN:
Yeah!
BETULE:
Or he doesn’t want to take his eyes off us to go for a pee. Quit looking at him.
STAN:
Well, we are talking behind his back.
BETULE:
Crap, he’s seen us.
STAN:
Oh yeah, geez, whoops.
(calls)
Hey there, stranger!
BETULE:
Stan, shut up!
STAN:
Well, it is closing time.
(calls)
Sorry, friend, bar’s closing. We’re gonna have to give you the old boot.
MAN:
(ominous)
Good night.
The stranger drops some coins on the table, then departs. The door closes behind him.
Stan goes over to the table.
STAN:
See, he said good night.
BETULE:
I know. So nice.
STAN:
Left a good tip, too. Oh, and look! There’s a little carved figurine. Isn’t that cute?
He picks up the figurine and trots it across the tabletop.
BETULE:
What did you say?
STAN:
What is this thing? Is it a dog?
BETULE:
It’s a message.
STAN:
It is? Like, in code or something? What does it mean?
BETULE:
It’s from Arvando Bassi.
STAN:
Bassi… Like, your old boss, that Bassi boss Bassi? The art mobster guy Bassi?
BETULE:
Yes, that Bassi! That guy was one of his, no question. Leaving figurines carved from bone is one of Arvando’s signatures. That’s how you know he’s marked you.
STAN:
Oh. Oh geez.
BETULE:
This is bad. Krispaar nukin, this is bad. I didn’t think he’d follow me all the way here.
Gubbin enters from the back.
GUBBIN:
Eh, what are you guys up to?
STAN:
Betula just got a message from her old boss.
BETULE:
I’m gonna have to leave town.
STAN:
Wait, what? No! Leave? Again?
BETULE:
If I don’t, you’re all in danger.
GUBBIN:
From your wacky little artist friend?
BETULE:
He’s serious. He’s coming to deconstruct this place. He even left a bone figurine.
GUBBIN:
Wow. That’s terrifying.
BETULE:
That’s what he does when he’s marked you for death.
GUBBIN:
Yeah, what else does he do? Draw a little frowny face on your door?
STAN:
What do you think, Gubbin? Is it supposed to be a dog, or a horse, or—
GUBBIN:
It’s a goat. A goat. DAMN that little bastard.
He smashes it to pieces with his fist.
STAN:
Whoa, whoa, Gubbin! What’s wrong?
GUBBIN:
How did he know?
BETULE:
Uncle?
GUBBIN:
Betula? Did you tell him? How did he know?
BETULE:
Know what?
GUBBIN:
About… goats.
BETULE:
Do humans not know about goats? Stan?
STAN:
I have seen goats.
GUBBIN:
No. This was something from back during the war. That bastard. How did he know?
STAN:
(lightly)
What, did you get attacked by goats?
(then)
Wait. You got attacked by goats?
GUBBIN:
Yeah. Commandos. Three of them. Tore our unit to shreds. We lost a lot of good people that day.
STAN:
Oh. I’m sorry, Gubbin.
BETULE:
That’s Arvando Bassi. Always with the symbolism.
STAN:
Is he sending commando goats?
GUBBIN:
Ha! Let him try. Let him try sending the gruff little bastards with their pointy beards. Let him send dragons, tornadoes, let him unleash hell for all I care! No one’s losing anybody here. We’re gonna teach these Mellurian hacks a thing or two!
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR—DAE:
High noon. Tense whispers as the regulars nail up boards and rearrange furniture to form a barricade, as they did in Episode 1. This time, however, everyone is stone cold sober.
GUBBIN:
All right, everyone. This might be it. This time we’re not dealing with some two-bit property developer.
STAN:
Okay, ouch.
GUBBIN:
This time our enemy is a truly deadly one. This is a man who’s murdered dozens of his foes and painted the walls with their blood.
BETULE:
Canvases, actually. He had a fit if any blood got on the actual walls—
GUBBIN:
The point is, he is a ruthless, scheming killer with delusions of artistic merit. But we will not let him win!
A cheer goes up.
STAN:
Guys. Hostiles sighted!
The regulars go quiet again.
GUBBIN:
How many?
STAN:
I count five coming this way.
GUBBIN:
What are they armed with?
STAN:
I see swords. And everyone’s got… it looks like slings.
GUBBIN:
It could be some kind of incendiary.
BETULE:
Nah, that’s something the Magical Demolitionists would do. He’d die before he copied them. Those slings are full of paint.
GUBBIN:
Are you sure?
BETULE:
Gold paint. It’s his favourite. He always said it went so well with the blood of his enemies.
GUBBIN:
Well, I’m sure his blood looks just as nice.
STAN:
Who does he think he is, redecorating without asking us?
GUBBIN:
You’re one to talk.
STAN:
Okay, now it looks like a battering ram.
GUBBIN:
Ooh, now we’re getting serious.
BETULE:
Looks like they’re stopping there.
GUBBIN:
Just five steps closer…
STAN:
I think they figured it out.
GUBBIN:
C’mon, I dug a tunnel all the way across the street and got it flooded with sewage. Don’t let it be for nothing.
They open the window.
BASSE:
Hello! People of the Axe and Crown. I bid you a good afternoon.
GUBBIN:
I know one way you could make it a better afternoon!
BASSE:
Mister Gubbin, is it not? What a lovely place you have here.
GUBBIN:
Aw, save your breath.
BASSE:
I must say, however, that the colour does not please the eye. Salmon Sunrise is the colour of the weak and stupid.
GUBBIN:
Take it up with the queen!
BASSE:
I should like to repaint your tavern in gold and red.
BETULE:
There it is.
GUBBIN:
Get to the point, Bassi.
BASSE:
If you insist. I believe you know the whereabouts of an acquaintance of mine. Miss Anna Betula?
GUBBIN:
Doesn’t ring a bell.
BASSE:
No? About this tall? Greyish blue? Tendency to steal and cheat?
GUBBIN:
Sorry, I can’t hear you too well. Can you come a little closer?
BASSE:
A little closer? So that we spring your inevitable booby trap?
GUBBIN:
(under his breath)
Dammit.
(to Bassi)
What booby trap?
From around the corner comes the squeaking and rumbling of big wooden wheels.
BASSE:
Luckily, I have no need to come closer. We brought this, you see…
STAN:
What the heck is that?
GUBBIN:
It’s a trebuchet.
BETULE:
Also loaded with paint. It’s what he did when he laid siege to the Indecisionists’ headquarters.
GUBBIN:
Close the shutters!
The regulars do, muffling the sounds from outside.
BASSE:
Prenda viso! Tira! (“Take aim! Fire!”)
A distant thump and whistle, then a huge splat of paint against the wall. The regulars gasp.
STAN:
Oh man, what did they hit?
GUBBIN:
Who cares? At least it’s just a bag of paint and not a rock.
STAN:
Aw man, we’re gonna have to redo the facade… again. Oh, and that sale on the pink paint, it’s totally over.
GUBBIN:
You don’t have a coupon or something?
STAN:
Nothing.
A series of smaller paint bombs smack against the shutters.
GUBBIN:
That would be the slings, I’m guessing.
STAN:
Why can’t people just make nice art?
Bassi’s crew ready another shot.
BASSE:
Tira!
The trebuchet creaks and another blast of paint hits the wall. The sign outside clatters to the pavement. Groans from the regulars.
GUBBIN:
That sounded like the sign.
STAN:
They didn’t!
He yanks the shutter open.
STAN (CONT’D)
(leaning out the window)
Now see here, you… you big jerks!
BASSE:
A vast improvement. No more of these sad old colours.
STAN:
Do you know what this sign means?!
BETULE:
Stan, quit leaning out the window!
STAN:
It’s not just a tavern, you know. That is the arms of the Second Royal Engineering Battalion—
A volley of paint bombs catch Stan square in the face. He falls out the window with a scream.
BETULE:
Stan!
EXT. STREET—CONTINUOUE:
Stan lands in the mud and lies groaning while Bassi’s crew laugh.
STAN:
Ugh…
BASSE:
Well, hello. A hostage? For me? Betula, you shouldn’t have.
BETULE:
(from the window above)
Don’t you touch him!
BASSE:
And who might you be?
STAN:
(panting)
I am Stanway Gerrard. I own the building.
BASSE:
Ahhh, of course.
STAN:
And you are an evil stupid head.
BASSE:
You fell out of a window. Who is the stupid one?
STAN:
‘Kay, that would probably be me. Although, I gotta say, it was a pretty good distraction, wasn’t it?
BASSE:
Distraction…
A squad from the town guard has snuck up behind Bassi’s crew. They draw swords.
SERGEANE:
Town guard! Freeze!
GUARE:
Hands up! You’re under arrest.
Chaos reigns for a moment. The guards roughly subdue the goons.
STAN:
The ELBO District Coalition is pretty uptight about vandalism and graffiti.
GUARE:
Hey, watch the face. I’ve got a date tonight.
SERGEANE:
All right, big guy. You’re coming with us.
Bassi draws a knife and grabs Stan.
BASSE:
Oh, I think not!
SERGEANE:
Whoa, okay!
STAN:
Whoa, whoa! Listen, listen! We can work this out!
BASSE:
Everybody, stay right where you are.
Silence falls.
BASSI (CONT’D)
(raises his voice)
Except for you, Betula. Where are you, troll?
The front door creaks open, and Betula emerges.
BETULE:
Right here.
BASSE:
Ah. How lovely to see you again.
BETULE:
How have you been, Arvando? Sold any good paintings lately?
BASSE:
You stole from me, Anna Betula Erfydsdottir. You stole something precious and irreplaceable.
BETULE:
I stole some cash. It wasn’t even real cash.
BASSE:
You know what I refer to.
BETULE:
Uhhh. Your dignity? Your trust in your fellow people?
BASSE:
My horse, you vile creature.
He tightens his grip on Stan.
STAN:
Ooo, knife, sharp, knife.
BETULE:
Your… wait, your horse?
BASSE:
Do not pretend innocence. You stole Azandia when you ran away.
BETULE:
No, I didn’t. Why would I do that?
BASSE:
To make your escape. She was the fastest racehorse in the kingdom.
BETULE:
(scoffs)
She wouldn’t be too fast with a troll riding her.
BASSE:
Well, what did you do with her? By the gods—you didn’t… eat her?
BETULE:
No, I didn’t eat her! Arvando—you really don’t know what happened to Azandia?
BASSE:
What did happen?
BETULE:
With this gang war going on, your family’s this close to broke. Your father sold her to some duke from Vaniacco. I dunno—I guess he didn’t want to admit it to you, so he blamed it on me?
BASSE:
You lie!
He grips Stan even more tightly.
STAN:
Ack!
BETULE:
Seriously? No one told you?
BASSE:
(breathes)
No.
BETULE:
C’mon guys, back me up. Miguel, you used to take care of Azandia. Did I steal her or did Pops sell her?
MIGUEE:
I—I am not supposed to say.
BASSE:
Miguel!
BETULE:
I’ll tell you, she’s probably safer in Vaniacco.
STAN:
She’s got a point. Can we all be friends now? Please?
BASSE:
You’re telling me my father lied to me. He betrayed me.
STAN:
Friendly friends?
BETULE:
Yup. I just borrowed a bit of cash.
BASSE:
And abandoned me! When I needed you most!
BETULE:
When you “needed” me to help you knock off one of your rivals.
BASSE:
Who then made his escape! It would have been… a masterpiece.
BETULE:
Oh well. There’s always the next idea. Can you let go of my friend now?
STAN:
Yes please! Good idea.
BASSE:
No… I still have a thirst.
STAN:
Well, why don’t you come in? You could have a nice pint of—
BASSE:
A thirst for art. And blood.
STAN:
Right. Okay. We don’t have those in stock…
BASSE:
You, Mister Stan. I shall paint your portrait and hang it in a special place of—
BETULE:
Ugh, are you still on that blood portraits thing? Gods, get a new gimmick.
BASSE:
It is not a gimmick!
STAN:
Gack!
BETULE:
It’s not even original. Sanguino da Laroncie did blood portraits. Hell, Claudia the Second was doing it a hundred years ago.
BASSE:
Yes, well, my work is in dialogue with the art of past eras…
BETULE:
Your work is a direct copy. Right down to those big splatters. Here we are in a different country and you can’t even come up with any new ideas? Come on!
BASSE:
Don’t rush me!
STAN:
Nghh!
BETULE:
(realizing it’s backfired)
No, wait, wait!
STAN:
Betulaaa! I don’t want to be art.
BASSE:
Oh, trust me, you will be glorious.
(growls)
As soon as I figure out what to do with you.
BETULE:
Arvando, look at me…
BASSE:
Something new. I can do something new! I shall act on pure instinct!
BETULE:
Arvando! It’s me you had a problem with, not Stan. Where’s the satisfaction painting with his blood?
STAN:
Yeah, listen… Mister Bassi? I may not be an artist, but I have tons of friends who are artists.
BASSE:
And?
STAN:
(rapid fire)
And… I think you just have to give yourself a break. They do that all the time. They give breaks. You don’t always have to be creating.
BASSE:
Yes, I do!
STAN:
Exact… no! You could treat this trip abroad like a vacation. That’s what you need. You need a vacation. Or a, a, a spiritual journey. If you take a spiritual journey, and go to different places, in your spirit on a journey type even, you could take in the sights. You could meet new people. You could enjoy scenic Mud Street right here! That’s where we are. This is Mud Street. You could go to the cape. You could watch the dragons frolicking in the waves just like that… huh?
BASSE:
Hmm. Go on.
STAN:
Okay. So. I mean, for example, we’re here right now. Look at the sky. You see the sky right over there? You see?
BASSE:
What about it?
STAN:
Okay. So. Just really really really look at it…
BASSE:
I am looking. What is—oof!
Betula downs him with one punch. He drops his blade and grunts as he slumps to the ground.
STAN:
Nice one, Betula!
BETULE:
Thanks. You okay?
STAN:
Yeah! Whew. That was very educational. And very strenuous. I think I’m going to just have a little lie down too.
BETULE:
Okay. Watch your step. No, watch your step!
STAN:
I’m okay! I’m just a little tired—augh!
BETULE:
Stan!
The ground gives way and he falls into a trough of muck.
STAN:
Oh, geez. Again?
MUSIC STINE:
INT. BAR—NIGHE:
The regulars are in a jubilant mood. Gubbin and Stan are pouring drinks.
GUBBIN:
Oh, you should have seen it. It was a glorious moment, man! Right in the sewage!
(cackles drunkenly)
All that digging wasn’t for nothing after all!
STAN:
(laughs along)
Heh, that’s a great story.
GUBBIN:
It was so funny. You were so funny.
The crowd laughs.
STAN:
Gubbin, listen. Listen, listen. All kidding aside. We, um, we all chipped in and we made you a little something.
GUBBIN:
Made me what?
STAN:
Just a present. From all of us.
GUBBIN:
Oh… oh. What is it?
STAN:
All right! Close your eyes.
GUBBIN:
Why.
STAN:
Because. It’s a surprise.
GUBBIN:
I hate surprises.
BETULE:
(serious)
C’mon, Uncle. Stan worked hard on this. Don’t spoil the moment.
The crowd quiets down.
STAN:
I thought we should give you something to show our appreciation of you as an awesome bartender, tavern-keeper and our friend.
GUBBIN:
(actually touched)
Yeah, yeah.
STAN:
Isn’t that right, everybody!
GUBBIN:
Okay, get on with it. I ain’t closing my eyes.
STAN:
It’s okay. You don’t have to. It’s in the kitchen!
GUBBIN:
Betula, you didn’t cook anything?
BETULE:
I’m telling you nothing.
GUBBIN:
All right, all right.
He steps toward the door.
STAN:
Betula and me and all your friends, we decided to give you… the night off!
Silence.
GUBBIN:
That’s it?
STAN:
Uh… wait, no, no, no, something should have happened…
GUBBIN:
What?
STAN:
Hold on. We moved the trigger under one of these floorboards…
GUBBIN:
The trigger… oh no!
STAN:
Whoaaa!
The kitchen booby trap springs and hauls Gubbin and Stan into the air. Ropes creak. The crowd roars with laughter.
STAN:
Okay, that wasn’t quite how it was supposed to happen, but… okay, the booby trap worked, so… yay?
GUBBIN:
Stan, was this your idea?
STAN:
Heh. You know, one day we’re gonna look back at this and laugh…
GUBBIN:
And in the meantime…
He strains at the ropes.
BETULE:
To Gubbin and Stan!
The crowd roars.
GUBBIN:
You’re all going to regret this!
BETULE:
All right, everybody. Drinks are on the house!
GUBBIN:
I swear! Every single last one of you!

STAN:
I never knew you had a tattoo.
