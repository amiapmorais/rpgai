[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Dust Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: Walk us in, Trav.
Justin: Take us out, cap.
Clint: Let’s go!
Travis: Roll for initiative.
Griffin: Roll that beautiful bean footage.
Travis: Roll your balls!
[laughter]
That’s a reference that only people who I think went to the Pub and Family Fun Center in Huntington, West Virginia would get.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Hi, welcome to the first episode of the Adventure Zone: Dust.
Griffin: Mmm, I can taste it, I can taste the dust in my mouth.
Travis: Dust.
Justin: Egh, eh, ugh, god.
Travis: It’s a double entendre, because one, it’s taking place in the dusty old west. But two, in the context of like ashes to ashes and dust to dust, it begins with a murder.
Clint: Dun-dun-dun.
Justin: I love this part of any fiction. My favorite part is the first paragraph of The Stand, where Stephen King is like, “This book is called the Stand, because later in the book some good people will take a stand against bad people.”
Travis: Get it?
Justin: Get it? Anyway, on with the story. [laughs]
Travis: This is how the prologue of any good story begins. Let me tell you why I picked this title. Hi, I’m Travis. So this is…
Justin: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, there were two cities, and this is the story of them and how they did their thing. [laughter]
Clint: This is their tale.
Travis: Alright, if we’re done with all the fun and games, let’s play some games.
[crosstalk]
Justin: There’s a little orphan later in the story, he shows up soon. His name is Oliver Twist, and this book is about him, or…
Griffin: You’re going to love him.
Justin: You’re going to love his whole thing.
Travis: He’s a real rascal.
Justin: He’s a rascal.
Clint: And he doesn’t believe in Christmas.
Travis: Wait, Oliver Twist doesn’t believe in Christmas?
[laughter]
Griffin: Yeah, it’s all part of the same universe.
Justin: What?
[Clint laughs]
Travis: So Oliver Twist grows up to be Ebenezer Scrooge?
Griffin: Yes. Absolutely. Travis, will you please tell us about the adventure.
Travis: Yes, so, to start off with, a little more background. So originally I talked about creating my own game system for this. And then what I learned was that’s really fucking hard. [laughter] There are people who work for years and years and years and they only do the one thing, and still then they play test that for years and years after that, so…
Griffin: I wanted to believe in you and nurture that flame, but there was an element of hubris to you saying, “Yeah I’ll just make my own.” It’s like, but this a hard— it’s an extremely hard thing.
Travis: Well ‘cause then I started to think, like, well what if they want to do this? And I was like man I don’t know. So then instead I set out to look for it a game system preexisting, and I really really liked the Powered by the Apocalypse: Monster of the Week that we’d been doing for Amnesty. So at first I started off thinking about that, but then the problem was Monster of the Week, as the name implies, builds to like fighting a big monster in each arc. And that’s not really what I had in mind for this, and so I started looking for other versions of Powered by the Apocalypse. And what I found is a game system called Urban Shadows.
Griffin: We should really drive home, 'cause I feel like on paper it may sound like this going to be kind of a similar thing, because Urban Shadows has a lot of, like, monster-centric stuff in it, but really a cursory look at the two systems, and their genre, and the rules, and the focuses of the different game— the foci— they could not be more different.
Travis: Yeah, you’ll hear some of the same terms, like the same of if you roll, you know, as 2 to 6, or a 7 to 9, or a 10 to 12, that kind of thing. And like adding one to roll, you’ll hear a lot of the same terminology. But Urban Shadows really, so, originally the one thing I knew right off the top of my head when thinking about an arc is I wanted it to be based around the interactions of vampires, werewolves, and humans, not as, you know, monsters versus hunters. But more as like people who didn’t see eye-to-eye and get along. And that there was tension between them, not like one hunts the other, but just like as they passed each other in the street there was tension. So what’s great about Urban Shadows is, that’s what it is. So Urban Shadows, the driving kind of mechanic is Factions. And the other driving force in Urban Shadows is Debt. So the way it works is if you do something for someone and both players, or the MC and the player, agree that that is worthy of a Debt, that person then owes you something that you can call in, and they either have to do it or risk taking a penalty if they refuse to honor the debt. And so…
Griffin: And all that stuff is tangible game mechanics.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Like these are numerical values that you add to, like, critical rolls.
Travis: So it’s so much more about the interpersonal interactions and connections than it is about fighting. And on top of that, what I really love is that unlike D&D, and I would also say, Fate and Monster of the Week, this is really kind of ready for player vs. player disagreements and conflict. So, like, you don’t have to get along. And in fact, the start of every session begins with the MC asking each player, “Which character does your character distrust the most.” So it’s all about, like, not necessarily getting along, you can still all be working towards the same goal, and still work together. But the idea that you’re just, like, inherently friends because you work together is just not really the way it always works.
And so I just love, I think, the interactions, the mechanics, but also the characters and the setup feels very different to me than any of the arcs we’ve played so far. So I’m really looking forward to that. Here’s what I want. This is not, as Griffin pointed out the other day, my goal here is not to be grimdark. It’s not like everybody’s so super broody and nasty to each other and filled with hate. It’s just more tense, you know? Like, for example: a lot of times in Balance we would, you know, kind of goof with like, the player characters would make a joke to an NPC that if you said to someone in real life would offend them, or like make the conversation go pretty south pretty quickly, but we rolled with because we were joking, right? And I think that that’s gonna be a little different in this, because it’s so about interpersonal interactions that if you’re trying to get information from someone and you make a joke about their, you know, the way they’re dressed or something.
Griffin: Their voice, or their shiny bowtie.
Travis: Right.
Griffin: Or how they waste spell slots.
Travis: That’s gonna be, they are then going to be less willing to give you the information.
Justin: What if it’s a very funny joke?
Travis: Well that’s the thing, I’m not saying you can’t joke. I just think, use it as a resource, you know what I mean? Where…
Justin: Aren’t you penalizing me for trying to make our comedy podcast funnier, then?
Travis: Yes. That’s what this…
Justin: ‘Kay, good. Folks, these arcs are limited, I just wanna remind you. Just a few episodes of the [incoherent] that’s intentionally not funny.
Travis: Well you know, humor’s different for different people, Justin. [Justin laughs] Maybe some people will find it funny that I penalized you for making a joke. That would be funny to me, I will enjoy that moment. So that’s the thing, I don’t want it to sound like, “I’m gonna make this dark and no one’s gonna have fun.” But it’s more, like, it’s just a little grittier. It’s a little more western-y, you know? I don’t want it to be as lighthearted but I’m also not trying to depress everyone with this. I’m just trying to be a little bit more realistic in the interactions that y’all have with each other and with the players, with the non-playable characters. So Griffin you’ve done this more times than me, what else do I need to tell people about this?
Griffin: Well, I mean, as long as we’re talking about tone we should address kind of the elephant in the room of interpreting and incorporating like real-world wild west sort of... social issues? Which is something that I think you’ve been very thoughtful of while sort of... crafting this.
Travis: Yeah, so in preparation for this arc, you know, I thought a lot about the wild west and, historically, what life would be like as far as like the social issues and incredible, massive amounts of racism and misogyny that would be present. And, you know, I saw a lot of people when I talked about doing the old west kinda arc and they were made uncomfortable by that concept, and you know what? So am I. And I don’t mean uncomfortable like I didn’t wanna discuss it, or that I wanna pretend like it didn’t happen, but more so is that I’ve seen from a lot of people that this show is an escape for them, and we—
Griffin: We try our best to make worlds that are inclusive and not filled with rampant racism and misogyny, even though that was sort of the case back in the wild west. Like, rubber hits the road, I don’t want to be interacting with racist and misogynist NPCs and I don’t think that the listeners necessarily want that either.
Travis: Yeah, so this is going to be a world inspired by, designed after, but not actually... the old west. So, it’s not set in our world? And I think that that also tracks because our world doesn’t have vampires and werewolves and demons and ghosts, that we know—
Griffin: That we know of! Haha, okay—
Travis: I’m glad we went to the same place, alright!
Griffin: Another thing that we talked about is not — ‘cause this is another sort of problematic trope that pops up whenever you do supernatural drama stuff like this — is treating relations between different supernatural things like vampires and werewolves as an allegory or a parallel to racism, which is I think pretty dismissive of very serious and very real problems that people deal with day to day, and that is also not what we’re doing. The way I’ve heard you describe it is like, this is about sort of families—
Travis: Yeah, cause this is way more Hatfield and McCoy. This is like the Blackwells run the copper mine, the Mathises run the silver mine, so they’re competing business interests, they both have pretty equal areas of the town they run, and it’s really, and I’ll get into this when I intro it, but it’s really this town is on the decline. And so there’s all this tension that just comes from that?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: So it all comes down to like, the families don’t like each other and because these families don’t like each other, the factions have naturally split into the people who side with each family. So it’s not necessarily, like, the entire race of werewolves in this world we’ve created and the entire race of vampires don’t like each other, it is specifically these two families, y’know? And how they interact? Cause that’s the thing, and what I love about Urban Shadows is that it gets down to, like, how individuals interact with each other.
Clint: And as the only one of us who was alive back during the wild west, [someone snorts] I think it’s a good choice, a good choice.
Travis: So! Let’s talk a little bit more about the world both of Urban Shadows and specifically the town of Dry River, which is where we’ll be playing, so Dry River—
Griffin: Now how’s a river get dry?
Travis: Well, we’ll talk about that in the course of the show. And so, Dry River is in the Crescent Territory — originally the Crescent River, now the Crescent Ravine — it’s this kind of unincorporated territory. And so one of the things about Urban Shadows is you’re dealing with kind of power struggles and it’s kind of originally, Urban Shadows is kind of built to be in like a big city, and in fact the book encourages you, like, you can use real cities if you want or create your own! So you can set it in like Chicago or you can create your own world.
Griffin: I mean it’s called “Urban Shadows,” it’s not called “Rural Old-Timey Shadows.”
Travis: Right. And so rather than just have kind of this individual town of like a thousand people, I’ve created a territory — think more of like a state — so all of them are very connected, so there’s like mining interests and criminal organizations that kind of thrive in this unincorporated territory. So rather than thinking like “city,” I’m thinking of it more as like a territory. And I worked with Brendan from Magpie Games who makes Urban Shadows to kind of make sure I wasn’t breaking the system at all with this, and so like we talked about connecting these and making sure there were still these power systems of, like, the workers versus the mining owners, the criminal organizations versus some kind of law-keeping body, and so making sure that there was still something to push against for all of these different people and factions and that kind of thing. Because otherwise it’s just chaos, and that’s not as interesting.
So yeah let’s talk a little bit about characters and what they mean. So a lot of the archetypes you’ll see is the same in, like, listen as I flip through my giant RPG binder, you’ll see a lot of the same kind of archetypes as there are in D&D, and Monster of the Week, and even some similar ones in Fate. Do you boys want to tell me about your characters? Or do you want me to go through some of the basic archetypes?
Griffin: It’s worth mentioning that the archetypes are divided into the four factions which are, what is it? Mortal, uh…
Travis: Yeah, so it’s Mortality, Night, Power and Wild. And so Mortality is like you’re human hunters, or you’re aware. So aware is like they know something’s going on, but they don’t have any inherent skills. So they’re like, they keep their eyes open, they can tell you about stuff they saw, they’re well researched but without any, like, inherent fighting abilities. So you have, like, your aware hunter veteran mortals, right? And then your Night, that’s where you get your vampires, your werewolves. And then in your Power that is someone who has taken on power. So like an oracle or a wizard. And then in Wild that’s where you get, like, your tainted, who are in league with demons. Or fae, who are like these, you know, these fairy creatures. And so if you’re in those factions you inherently get along better.
So another interesting thing about Urban Shadows that makes it really great for storytelling is it gives you a lot of the big points? You know, like, this is a vampire, this is what they can do. This is a werewolf, this is what they can do. This is someone who’s tainted with demon, this is what they can do. But as far as the, like, supernatural lore, it leaves a lot of room to fill in, right, so for our story vampirism and lycanthropy are hereditary. And so there are vampire families and werewolf families, and it’s not about being turned, it is genetic. So, like, if you have a werewolf parent and a human parent, they are codominant genes, so it’s fifty fifty chance the child will be a werewolf. If you…
Griffin: Can you— in this world— Can you still turn somebody? Or is that just, like, not how it works?
Travis: I think that it’s not how it works unless, you know what I mean? ‘cause when we’re talking about there are wizards, there are fae creatures, there are demons, I don’t want to rule anything out.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Because depending on the person…
[crosstalk]
Griffin: Most of them were born into it, is what you’re saying.
Travis: Yeah, but that genetic mutation had to start somewhere.
Griffin: Okay, excellent.
Travis: You know what I mean?
Griffin: Dracula. It started with Dracula.
Travis: It had to start with Dracula. So yeah, so and a lot of that also, that’s about the only decision I’ve made. And then past that when we’re creating characters I’m probably going to ask you questions. Like, “So how does it work as far as this?” and you will help fill in— as the creator of these characters— help fill in the supernatural lore as we go.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: So I think we danced around it long enough. Why don’t we start. Uh, Justin, do you want to tell me about your character?
Justin: Sure, I’d love to, Trav.
Travis: Then please do!
Justin: Well then I will. Here it comes.
Travis: Okay. Fine. Do it. Coward.
Clint: Okay, Justin, your turn.
Griffin: What’s wrong, baby? You scared like a baby?
Justin: My turn is starting now. I am playing, which it seems predetermined considering our lives at this point, I am playing a ghost [Clint laughs], whose name is Augustus Parsons. Now, did I realize when I picked the name Augustus that it sounds like “a ghost”? I did not. [laughter]
Travis: Okay, I did not put that together. Thank you so much.
Clint: “A Ghost Us.” That’ll be the name of your clothing line.
Justin: That is what, that is where we find ourselves. He is the, was the boss, chief executive officer, of the Augustus Parsons Cashew Company. And he was an industrial magnate who died through mysterious circumstances. And he is trapped here on Earth, and he was a very, he was not a good person. He was a bad person, as many wealthy industrialists are, I guess. Just like all of us, there are good and bad. But he is trapped here on earth, and the way Travis and I kind of talked about it is... that this sort of agency or what have you that we are a part of, he is bound into service to them to make up for the wickedness that he did during his life.
Travis: Now as far as that goes, J-man, is it like once he’s ticked enough boxes? Or is it just, like, there is no predetermined…
Griffin: What’s that fucking show you guys reference all the time that nobody’s ever watched? The 99 deeds of... what’s-his-face?
Clint: Oh yeah, where he had to save a hundred souls, or 99 souls?
Justin: The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage, my friends. The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage, was a hit.
Travis: You could also relate it to Cupid with Peremy Jivens, where Peremy Jivens had to get a hundred couples together.
Griffin: Let’s not— let’s not make that the anchor.
Travis: Okay, we’ll stick with 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage.
Justin: So anyway…
Griffin: Yeah, it’s much more relatable.
Justin: It’s nothing finite, because I don’t think, I think that that would imply that if he could somehow balance what he did in his mortal life, I think that the deal is much more ephemeral than that. He assumes that he will be released at some point, but he doesn’t have, like, a meter.
Griffin: I can’t wait to hear—
Justin: Salvation meter.
Griffin: I can’t wait to hear what kind of sins that really hard-nosed cashew business requires for folks to get ahead.
Travis: You wouldn’t believe it, it’s nuts.
Griffin: Ah Jesus... God…
Travis: See, there’s still jokes!
Griffin: Yeah, there’s still gonna be jokes and it’s all gonna be sort of nut/cashew-based humor.
Justin: The main reason that he— when you create a character, a Spectre, there’s questions you need to answer. Who are you? Check. Who do you still love? I still love my cashew company. And that is something that I’m still very preoccupied with. I’m thinking a lot about how the business is being run, and I’m like trying to keep an eye on the business while I also slam evil as a phantom once instructed us to—
Clint: Aw man, it’s like Undercover Boss!
Travis: Sure?
Griffin: It’s a lot like Undercover Boss.
[crosstalk]
Travis: Is the cover he’s under a bedsheet with the eye holes cut out?
Justin: Yeah, invisible boss. He also has a daughter that he was not a, this will come as a shock, he was not a great father in his life. His daughter’s name is Anna Cardiem Parsons, and she is in the care of — Travis, sorry, you texted me the — the Church, sorry, in the care of the Church. So he can’t necessarily— I think that like, it is unpleasant for him to sort of check up on her, that being a church and it being a lot of— it’s sort of like a weird vibe for a ghost I think to hang out in? So—
Clint: Except for the Holy Ghost.
Justin: Yes, okay, the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ of course are permitted within the church.
Travis: The Church is like the church body, y’know what I mean, so it’s not like a specific building, but more of like the governing church body in this unincorporated territory is the Church. Right? So, someone works for the Church, you know what I mean? Think that kind of thing rather than “Oh I’m gonna go to the church!” It’s “ah, he works for The Church.” Right?
Justin: Uh, and— yes, and also because they are providing for the welfare of his daughter, he owes them two Debts. So I don’t know Trav if you want to think of that as like a certain person in the church that he owes two debts to or just the entity itself, I don’t know what makes the best fit.
Travis: I would say that for the purposes of this territory spread out, that it is the entity of the Church, you owe two Debts, you know what I mean?
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: That it’s like the church can call in and maybe they call in— so the organization that you all three are agents of, I’m calling it the Grayson agency, and it’s very much like the Pinkertons if anyone’s familiar with that, where they are kind of detectives/arbiters/muscle for hire. They are not necessarily a law-keeping — they are NOT, not even necessarily — they are not a law-keeping organization, it is bodyguards, for whatever you need. And so you are all agents of that, so maybe it’s like, the Church could call in the debt with the Grayson agency to have you investigate something or a member of a representative of the Church could specifically call in that favor from you. And I have named some organizations of people after listeners: the Grayson agency is named after Grayson Berg. Not any— because some people, I wanted to leave the option that maybe they are bad villain-type people, and I didn’t wanna name—
Griffin: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Travis: —bad villain-type people after our nice listeners.
Griffin: You referenced the Pinkertons, and we should probably clear up that we’re not gonna be doing any union-busting in this game.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: I think that also goes against the ethos of what we’re going for.
Travis: No, no, no. No union-breaking. Cool! So, Justin, couple other questions that go along with the character creation. How long have you been in the territory and with the Graysons?
Justin: Five years I’ve been— I mean, the cashew company is in the territory, so I’ve been in the territory my whole life, it’s old money. But I have been dead, I think five years?
Travis: Okay.
Justin: Sounds about right, so I’ve been with the Graysons five years.
Travis: So then how old is Anna?
Justin: She is… 12. He’s a bad father, yeah, and that doesn’t magically [Justin laughs] get fixed, ‘cause he’s a ghost.
Clint: Well let’s face it, cashews are easy to love.
Travis: Cashews are easy to love, so delicious.
Justin: What’s the— is there a movie about a ghost that’s trying to be a good dad— Ghost Dad. So he’s not a ghost dad, he’s—
Griffin: Jack Frost, Jack Frost.
Justin: [laughing] Jack Frost, thank you, that’s the—
Travis: There might be a lot of movies about it.
Griffin: And actually-
Clint: The Shining, The Shining.
Travis: Well…
Griffin: —In both those examples, except for The Shining, it does magically turn you into a good dad. [chuckling]
Justin: [laughing] Okay, so this isn’t a Ghost Dad scenario.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: In many senses of the word.
Travis: Who is your closest confidant in the territory?
Justin: So I don’t really— oh man, I haven’t really thought that way ‘cause I’ve kinda seen him as somebody who’s kind of apart from it.
Travis: Well can I make a suggestion, just from—
Justin: Yeah, please.
Travis: —like what you’ve put me so far, is: who took over the cashew company that Augustus is maybe most in contact with as far as like— so confidant, I think for Augustus, maybe doesn’t mean “tells their deepest darkest secrets” but maybe the person that they still feel most connected to and that they interact with the most, so was there somebody who took over the cashew company when A-ghost-us passed?
Justin: Yes. Garrett Althiser. And he hates his guts. He thinks he’s an absolute nincompoop. If he had known he was gonna die, he would have created some sort of succession plan for some of the more competent people, but Garrett Althiser is the one who’s sort of like, ascended to running it, and he is the main person that he is haunting to try to make him do a better job.
Travis: Was Garrett kind of like a yes-man that Augustus kept around?
Justin: Yes.
Travis: Yeah, okay.
Justin: Yes. Exactly. Garrett is sort of not unlike a Smithers-type, except that Smithers, I think, would do a very competent job. And maybe Garrett Althiser is doing a competent job, but in the views of Augustus he is incompetent.
Travis: Last question, then we’ll talk about, like, the moves that Augustus gets, but, last question, what—
Justin: Ah yeah, he’s got lots of cool moves.
Travis: What do you desperately need?
Justin: What I desperately need is to return to my corporeal form and take control of my cashew company. Barring that, I guess, release from my spectral prison so at least I don’t have to see Althiser run my precious jewel of a company into the ground.
Travis: So, who wants to go next?
[crosstalk]
Griffin: You don’t want to talk about his powers?
Travis: Oh right, let’s talk about your sick moves.
Justin: Yeah, I’ll blow through it real quick, cause it’s kind of pretty ghost-like.
Travis: And maybe tell us a little bit about your Demeanor and Looks as well.
Justin: So, in the character creation process, it gives you options on your Look and your Demeanor for you to pick from, so I chose male and Caucasian. And that’s kind of boring because that’s what I am, so that’s how I kinda roll. But I thought, since he’s not a great dad, it seemed kind of yucky [Griffin: Sure.] to pick a different race to depict him. Also, he’s an evil industrialist which, like, that’s probably a white guy, right? I mean?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Probably, I would guess, so that’s what we’re going with. The demeanor here is antiquated, I think that’s probably the best, at least, socially speaking, a gentleman, as those things go, that’s sort of his thing. I think of him as like, he was definitely in his late 60s with a… think like a frock coat, like really dressed to the nines. He was somebody who was very put together and very focused on his appearance. Craggy, angular, sort-of dude. So that’s how I’ve sort of envisioned him. His cool powers are, one, he can Manifest. So, he can choose to be two of these: heard, seen, or can touch or be touched. I have to choose two. If I want to choose one or three, I have to take a corruption point.
Travis: Now, that’s at a time, as I understand it. So this isn’t something you have to predetermine now.
Justin: No, in each situation I have to choose which of those two I can take.
Griffin: That is such a fuckin’ cool way to do ghosts in a game.
Justin: It’s really cool. The other abilities I’ve chosen are— one is called Ghost Town. That means I can go hang out with ghosts to try to find more information. And I feel like he finds them contemptible, but, y’know, they’re a useful resource from time to time. The other one is “Wall? What Wall?” He always has the option to escape.
Travis: Great, then the—
Justin: [interrupting] I can choose an additional option off the list to bring somebody with me for that, but I think it’s mainly just him being able to leave.
Travis: You also— so, another cool thing about Urban Shadows is you have your basic moves, but then yo—
Justin: [interrupting] Oh, oh, by the way, one last thing. If I fail that escape roll it attracts the attention of dangerous spirits and ghosts in the area. [laughs]
[crosstalk]
Travis: Yep.
Griffin: Fuck yeah.
Travis: So, you also have drama moves. So, there’s a— [Justin: Johnny Drama moves.] Johnny Drama moves. There’s a concept in Urban Shadows called corruption, and so, basically, corruption is any time you let your character slip closer to the darker inner parts of their nature, they get a little bit more corrupted. And if they get fully corrupted, they retire from your control to my control as a danger to the city.
Griffin: So good.
Travis: And so, if you give in to the darker part of your nature and allow corruption to happen, then I get to keep you.
Griffin: What’s awesome is that, before you get to that point where your character becomes an NPC threat, you actually get more powerful. [Travis: Yep.] You get other— [Justin: Right.] you get new powers, because that’s— that’s— this is something that video games fuck up so much. Of, like, the good and evil slider where it’s just, like, “Oh yeah, you can— are you gonna rob this person or are you gonna, y’know, help them out? Either way, you’re gonna get this cool sword.” And it’s like, well then it doesn’t fuckin’— it doesn’t matter as much. Like, BioShock did this a lot, right, where it’s like, “Do you wanna harvest the— the— the little girl for her magic energy, or do you want to save her?” No matter what, you’re gonna end up getting, like, cool— cool powers and stuff like that, when really, like, if you do the evil thing there’s a reason behind it, and it’s because your pursuing some sort of power in some way. And this game is like, “Yeah, you get more powerful and more powerful and more powerful and then you become an enemy,” and that’s really cool!
Justin: Yeah, his— he gets, like, the ability to possess people and stuff like that the more corrupt— I’m gonna be— he’s gonna get pretty corrupt pretty quick. [Travis: Yeah.] That’s kind of my plan.
Travis: And so, what— what do you— what happens— what is the corruption move of a Spectre?
Justin: The Spectre corruption drama move is: When I see someone being victimized and I do nothing, I mark corruption.
Travis: So good. There’s also, along with corruption moves, there are also intimacy moves. Where, if you have a moment of intimacy, and maybe that’s romantic or maybe it’s just a close conversation or whatever— whatever we determine in play as an intimacy moment, then each different archetype gets a different intimacy move that they can then use.
Justin: Um, my intimacy move is— uh, it’s really cool actually, when I have a moment of intimacy with someone, I hold one. And whenever they get into trouble, I can spend my hold to instantly go to where they are.
Travis: It’s like Al from— from Quantum—
[crosstalk]
Justin: [interrupting] Exactly.
Griffin: It’s very—
Justin: It’s my— it’s my Ziggy move.
Travis: And then we also have, y’know, a bunch of standard stuff— and we’ll talk more about advances and everything when we get to it, but—
Griffin: [interrupting] This is a— this is a little bit crunchier of a game than Monster of the Week was, so I don’t think we need to go into, like, every detail.
Travis: We’ll [Griffin: —every detail.] get to ‘em when we get to ‘em.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: [muttering] Okay so who wants to go next?
Griffin: Dad, do you want to go? You want to do it?
Clint: Sure, yeah.
Travis: Who are you?
Griffin: Oh oh oh, what Faction is the Spectre?
Travis: Oh.
Justin: I mean it’s not really a certain Faction, if we’re talking about Faction alignments.
Griffin: No, but it says a member of blank.
Justin: Well he would technically be Night.
Griffin: Okay. Alright, sorry Dad.
Clint: No, that’s alright. My character’s called Gandy Dancer.
Griffin: I did not know this was a thing until you explained it.
Clint: Yeah. I did my research, man.
Travis: Yeah, you’re a real nerd.
Clint: Her parents were workers on the ocean-to-ocean railroad.
Travis: The old OTO.
Clint: The old OTO.
Travis: The Oh-Toh.
Clint: And there was an accident in which they were killed, but in very heroic fashion they saved about a dozen of their coworkers, and they both died.
Griffin: Yes, that’s typically what happens when people are killed.
Clint: And so…
Travis: Well to be fair this is a world with like spectres and stuff, so…
Griffin: That is a fair point, Travis, I did not consider ghosts.
Clint: And you know what, put an asterisk next to that, [laughter] maybe that’s something we want to go back to.
Travis: The option’s always there, you know what I mean?
Clint: So Emil Moche, who was the head of the OTO, the multi…
Griffin: Did you name this person after your own middle name?
Clint: I actually named this person after my own great grandfather, whose name was Emil Moche.
Travis: Okay, well, no I do want to point out I specifically made the choice not to name characters that might end up being jerks after our listeners, but you just went ahead and did it for your grandfather.
Clint: Well I don’t know if he was a jerk or not. I don’t think he was.
Travis: But he could be!
Griffin: He could be.
Travis: You don’t know if your own grandfather was a jerk or not.
Griffin: Okay, that’s fair.
Clint: Great grandfather. My grandfather was great. Anyway Moche partly maybe for PR, partly to be a sound business decision, Moche has sort of... taken her under his wing, and has agreed to like pay for anything for her life to…
Travis: Now let’s clarify that, though.
Clint: Yeah.
Travis: ‘Cause you say taken, is that like he’s had direct influence?
Clint: No.
Travis: Or he just like, with money, he’s created a bankroll for her.
Clint: He’s buying off…
Griffin: It’s a legal settlement.
Clint: Yeah, it’s a legal settlement. It’s a PR move, it’s just good business, and I don’t want to completely make Emil sound like a complete doofus, I mean I think there was actually some gratitude on his part for their heroics. But for the most part it’s like a settlement. It’s to get good publicity and at the same time take care of this child. She’s a wizard, so I guess that puts her in the…
Griffin: Power?
Clint: Power. [Travis: She’s in Power, yeah.] Right. And she has traveled the world studying everything she could about magic. She’s obsessed with the arcane, she’s collected books and artifacts, learning every… possible thing that she could. They call her Gandy Dancer because when her parents were killed, the other workers didn’t really know her name, they named her Gandy Dancer. For one thing a Gandy Dancer was somebody who worked on the railroads. So now she has come back and the railroads — she loves the railroads — so she came back, she worked for a while as an agent on the railroads and she got this job.
Travis: How long have you been in the territory and with the Graysons?
Clint: I think she’s been with the Graysons for a couple of years. Are the Graysons based in… Dry River? Is that what you said?
Travis: They are based in the Crescent Territory, yes.
Clint: I would say that she’s been working in the Territory for maybe a year, so does she have to be familiar with the actual town?
Travis: No.
Clint: No, I think she’s really new to the town, she’s on an assignment.
Travis: Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha.
Griffin: I think it’s fascinating having somebody who’s like, a world traveler who is here, who probably just sees it as just another stop, like another pin in the map.
Clint: Yeah, it’s kind of a gig to her, I mean because her job is really not her primary drive, I mean.
Travis: It’s just a means to an end.
Clint: Right.
Travis: So what keeps you up at night?
Clint: She’s absolutely terrified of death.
Travis: Relatable.
Justin: Too real, too real.
Clint: She is obsessed with it, I mean, because she saw her parents, whether it was heroic or not…
Travis: Even as an infant it stuck with her?
Clint: Oh I think something like that stuck with her, yeah.
Justin: Is she trying to beat it?
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: I like that.
Justin: Cool.
Travis: Let’s go ahead and jump to what you desperately need, then. So what, is that her main drive and ambition?
Clint: She wants to beat death. She wants to, that’s— she’s studied magic, she wants to be immortal. She is, that’s why she is so obsessed with magic, that’s why she’s so obsessed with the arcane. She is going to beat it. She’s going to live forever. Fame! She’s going to live forever.
Travis: Is there anyone that Gandy is close to?
Clint: Well one of the things about wizards is they have what’s called a Sanctum Sanctorum.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Clint: And I decided to make hers kind of mobile. There’s no rail service, I guess to Dry River.
Travis: No.
Clint: So she has this Black Maria, which was a police vehicle, a great big rolling…
Griffin: A paddywagon.
Clint: A paddywagon, yeah. And so she’s converted this paddywagon…
Travis: But like in carriage form, yeah.
Clint: Right. And this paddywagon is her Sanctum Sanctorum. It’s loaded up with all of her arcane artifacts and everything else. And it’s horse-drawn, and the Sanctum Sanctorum allows you to have a very knowledgeable assistant, so she has this… [laughs] her assistant is a haunted doll.
Griffin: Fantastic.
Clint: A homunculus, they call them, and his name is Michael, [laughter] and Michael is her coachman too. He drives the horses. But he’s like this repository of arcane knowledge, dresses in robes from the Italian Renaissance.
Travis: Well so let me ask you this, then keeping in mind that... these are real things in this world. Is it a ghost of a person that is inhabiting this doll? Or is it a demonic spirit?
Clint: I don’t know. I don’t know.
Travis: Does Gandy know?
Clint: Oh yeah, Gandy knows.
Travis: Okay, well you created Gandy, so… [laughter]
Clint: I would say probably.
Justin: Dad, you’re out there what she doesn’t know.
Clint: Demon, demon. I’d say it’s possessed by a demon.
Travis: Okay, excellent.
Griffin: I’m curious to hear the moves, ‘cause this is like the third magic user that we’ve had across the different campaigns, and I’m wondering how…
Clint: Yeah and, well I’ve never really used a magic user. I don’t count— I don’t count Merle. [laughter]
Travis: Excellent, okay.
Clint: And so…
Travis: It’s just nice to hear you say it.
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: A wizard gets spells they can use, so the wizard moves are basically Channeling, which is kind of you collecting your magic, gathering your magic, and the Sanctum Sanctorum, using the Sanctum Sanctorum is also a move. And then you get to choose three spells, and I tried to, I picked three that I thought— I like balanced characters. So Gandy is going to be able to summon Elementalism, which is like the only offensive thing she has. And Shielding, which I thought it might be nice to have somebody who could do some protecting. But also Tracking, I thought that would be really important to what we were trying to do, and so you can track somebody to learn their location magically.
Travis: And Dad and I talked about it in creating his character, where I think what we came to is in this supernatural context, like because power specifically is different for Mortal, right? So this is not a Mortal human being who can do magic, this is someone who has taken on power and become different. And so what it is is Gandy has magic, and then carries Foci that allow her to use that magic in specific ways.
Clint: Right. I didn’t want her to be an all-powerful spellslinger or anything that she wanted to come up with she could, she basically has these three spells and they work through artifacts that she carries.
Travis: Tell us, Dad, a little bit about the wizard-specific Corruption move.
Clint: Oh yeah, Drama moves. The wizard Corruption move is if you strike a deal with somebody dark and powerful, you’ve got to mark Corruption.
Travis: Yes.
Clint: So I’m thinking that maybe, well for instance if she uses Michael, if that’s a demon would that not make her take on…
Travis: But it depends. You can use them, but then if there’s some kind of deal like, “Well I could tell you that…” which also is I think another good balance where Michael doesn’t just give you all the information you need.
Clint: Right.
Travis: He gives you, maybe you’ve already struck a deal for certain levels of information and certain levels of power, and you have to make a decision of how much do you, how much deeper do you go?
Justin: Kind of like Bob.
Travis: Yeah, like Bob, right. That’s another Dresden Files, not just a weird my friend Bob. You know, my friend Bob? Don’t make deals with Bob. [laughter] What is the look? So you said Gandy is female.
Clint: Right. She’s female, she is Asian.
Griffin: Specifically East Asian, right?
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s how you described her to us earlier, it’s weird that’s like not in the list for character creation in this game, but I think it would behoove us to be a little bit more specific.
Clint: And you know I think she has really embraced the investigator, the you know, I think she would dress in dark colors, I think you know in variations of standard Western wear, like maybe in…
Travis: So in the options are archaic clothing, comfortable clothing, dark clothing, fancy clothing.
Clint: I’d go dark, but at the same time I think she would dress, you know with pants and a cool vest. Maybe a duster, although we just used the duster…
Travis: I will write down “cool vest,” but you’re going to have to prove to me that such a thing exists.
[Griffin laughs]
Clint: Uh Mr. James West on The Wild Wild West…
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m just kidding, if you’re about to jump on Twitter to tell you about how cool your vest is, that was a joke. I own vests too.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Vests are great. Just a little friendly ribbing betwixt my dad and I.
Griffin: Can I talk about mine now?
Travis: Real quick, ‘cause it just occurred to me that I haven’t mentioned this yet, so in Monster of the Week, to compare it, you level up your character when you fail a bunch, right? So if you fail enough, you get to level up. One of the things that they do in Urban Shadows to encourage you to deal with other factions outside of your own and make Faction moves, is anytime you interact with a faction you get to mark that faction, and when you fill up all four of them, that’s how you more or less level up your character. And so it really drives you to play more with the interactions with the other groups and interpersonal interactions. Anyways, I just thought that was a cool thing that we hadn’t touched on yet. Okay, Griffin, tell me about your character.
Griffin: So Travis, in us creating our characters, Travis…
Travis: I thought you were gonna name your character Travis.
[crosstalk]
Griffin: So Travis…
Justin: What an honor that would be.
Griffin: Travis kind of encouraged us to try to have characters that are in these different groups, specifically werewolves and vampires, and I made my character last ‘cause I was working on finishing up Amnesty, and we didn’t have one of those either, either one of those, so I was trying to figure out a way to a werewolf or a vampire that would be, like, interesting to me, because I’m not super interested in doing something that kind of already exists in the world. Like, following the strict vampire or werewolf rules, even though we get to tailor what those are, I didn’t think would be, like, particularly satisfying, and so what I landed on is I’m making a werewolf, the class is called the Wolf, it’s a member of Night. And he’s a hunky teen named Jacob. No. I could.
Justin: I got so excited for a second.
Travis: I know, I was like, “Ah yeah, now we’re rocking it to that next level.”
Griffin: No, what made it click was Travis mentioning…
Justin: How to make this podcast commercial.
Griffin: Travis mentioned that this was a game kind of about politics, and that kind of resonated with me. The idea of a werewolf pack being a political thing inherently, right? Like they have territory that they control and there are hierarchies of power inside of a werewolf pack, and all that stuff I thought was interesting, and so I kind of blended that with my idea which is a werewolf former politician. Somebody who, I think, used to live in like a larger city than Dry River, and was a local politician. I’ve done some research, and it’s actually kind of tough to find. There was not a lot of, like, codified political structures in small cities, especially unincorporated territories like Dry River, and so I think he was, like, something akin to a city council member, or an alderman. Somebody who had a very hyper-localized sort of area of influence.
Travis also encouraged us not to make all, like, purely good characters, but I liked the idea of somebody who once was a very idealistic politician, a Mr. Smith Goes to Washington kind of type, but also somebody who was very ambitious. Like, I think my character wanted to be president one day, but his sort of werewolf transformation and powers started to manifest, and then that sort of became kind of a nonstarter. His name is Errol Ryehouse, and so when these powers started to manifest, his wolf nature started to manifest, I think he wanted to stop it. I think he wanted a way out because he wanted to be president, and we can make this world what you want it, but I still think he was worried about trying to be a werewolf president, right?
[laughter]
Travis: Though to be fair, coming this summer:
All: Werewolf President.
Griffin: So he tried to find a way out of it, and that is where I found what I think is interesting about this character, and it was something I kind of had to work with Travis on to make it work for the game. He sought out a magical means of reversing his lycanthropy, and it went wrong, and now he is permanently half transformed between human and werewolf. He is permanently, imagine in Teen Wolf or, I mean any werewolf movie, but for me Teen Wolf was the anchor here. That where he’s starting to get a little hairy, starting to transform a little bit, and then you know like, “Uh-oh, it’s about to go down,” except for him it’s just always about to go down, he is constantly mid-transformation. And that required kind of some tailoring of this class and how it operates, specifically the Wolf has a whole section about the transformation where you have these latent things you get as a benefit. You get Natural Weaponry for plus two Harm, and one Armor, Armor is a thing in this game, it functions basically the same way as it did in Monster of the Week.
So he has that stuff but then you get to pick these other powers where you pick two powers and two weaknesses, and because he’s just always half transformed, I think he only gets one power and one weakness, and that is that he has even more Armor on top of that, he has two Armor naturally. His weakness was tough for me, because a lot of these were sort of geared around, like, there’s one that’s you can’t resist the change when it comes. So the thing that I thought would be more interesting for Travis is to just lean into one sort of established piece of werewolf lore which is that silver weapons ignore my Armor.
Travis: Excellent.
Griffin: So he is, he’s an Armored character, right? And that’s like his big benefit, is that he is tough, ‘cause he is always in half transformation, unless somebody knows his weakness, which is silver.
Travis: That’s cool.
Griffin: And as cliche as that it, like, I think it lets you do some really interesting stuff.
Travis: Just to establish that piece of supernatural lore too, in the world, why that’s such a great pick, is one of the hereditary traits of werewolves in this world I’ve created is an allergy to silver. And so for most, you know it manifests in different forms, just as people have different reactions to different allergies. And I love that for Errol it’s, like, poison, you know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: It’s not just like it causes a little bit of discomfort and itching, it’s like no no no no no, no no no, this is severe.
Griffin: Well, and everyone who has, like, superpowers also needs a weakness.
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: And as literal as this is, I think it could be really interesting. So what’s cool about the Wolf class, and the reason why I thought a werewolf politician would be so interesting, is you have a mechanic called your Territory, and I’m using some of the same vernacular that Travis is using, my Territory is not Dry River, it is an area inside of Dry River, and I think the fiction there is that he once was a local politician in his hometown, and I think despite the fact that that part of his life is kind of over, he still wants to fight for a neighborhood, and that’s what his Territory is, is a neighborhood.
And in sort of the game’s language, it is like a werewolf territory, it is a hunting grounds and while you are in there you have certain benefits and there are certain things you kind of have to watch out for while you defend that territory, but for him it is literal political territory. It is his neighborhood. So my Territory, I get to choose some stuff. It spans several city blocks, the people here work hard to keep the streets safe from crime? basically? So it’s like a nice part of town because of his guardianship, his stewardship. But there is some sort of presence more powerful than me that the people in the Territory swear fealty to.
That is probably the actual, you know, mayor or sheriff or this town, like the people are grateful for Errol’s support, but like they still have to do the regular town shit. I left a lot of blanks ‘cause I didn’t know that much about what Dry River was, and I thought that Travis could help me fill in the gaps a little bit more. And also mortals in the area are actively trying to revitalize local businesses and architecture. Kind of like a Goonies-esque vibe? Where I think this is like just a residential area in the town that he tries to keep safe despite this, like, quiet war that is happening in Dry River, for control. But on top of that, also it’s a town that is maybe changing a little bit, and he is trying to, like, resist that change because I think the more it changes the less power and less control he has in the Territory.
And all of his moves stem from that, so like I am really good at hunting people down in my Territory. I’m really good at persuading people in my Territory. I actually roll, there’s different stats in the game, and Heart is what you usually roll with when you have to persuade somebody, it’s like your Charisma, but there’s also a stat called Blood that is like the raw power in your blood, which werewolves are, like, all about, and in your Territory you actually roll with that to persuade people. And so there’s different…
Travis: That is so good, Ditto.
Griffin: Thanks, man. Yeah, so there’s different, like, benefits that he gets from being a werewolf politician when he is specifically in his neighborhood. And it’s such a different way of doing business than he used to do it, right? He’s not getting out there pressing the flesh and kissing babies, I don’t think anybody would, you know, let him get that close to their baby at this point, but it is a way of interpreting these two things in a way that I think is gonna be really really cool. So that is…
Justin: How do the people in his Territory feel about him now that he’s half-wolf?
Griffin: Yeah, well I think they’ve only known him as half werewolf.
Justin: Oh.
Griffin: ‘Cause he came to Dry River, I think he came to Dry River as, like, I think that Dry River’s a place where you can be as a werewolf or as a vampire, right?
Travis: Just to jump in real quick, just to give you and listeners kind of the way I’m envisioning the territory as a whole, and how Dry River fits in there. So I think about it a lot like Los Angeles, right? Where Los Angeles is this gigantic city and within it you have, like, the Valley and West Hollywood, and Venice Beach, and you have all of these individual neighborhoods that have, within themselves, like, their own local governments and their own kind of, you know, like the mayor of Hollywood and that kind of thing. And so Dry River would be like Culver City, you know what I mean? Where it is the thing, and the Crescent Territory’s like Los Angeles as a whole.
Griffin: Right.
Travis: So when you talk about your territory yes, absolutely. You all do not live in Dry River, but Dry River exists within a territory and within a section of Crescent Territory that I definitely think you have influence over.
Griffin: And his Territory I still have, I have not, like, nailed it down. But I think it’s just the place where people live. I don’t think it’s like the business district, I don’t think it’s like the main, you know, political hub of the city, I think that he is not, I think he is— so just like looking at his Faction stats, it’s basically across the board like, okay, I think he doesn’t, I don’t think he’s necessarily ingratiated with the werewolf community, because he’s half werewolf.
I don’t think he’s necessarily beloved by the human community outside of his Territory, because he’s half-human, like I think he’s kind of in between somewhere. And like, that’s the kind of stuff that I want to explore with him, this idea of yeah, werewolves are political and he is just now trying to learn what that means as a former politician, because he has these skills, and he’s still a very idealistic very good person, it’s just there’s, he’s had to change the way he thinks about politics and interpersonal relationships, and how he is able to help the city in which he lives.
Clint: And they will love him as long as the garbage gets picked up on time and the potholes get fixed.
Justin: That’s right. [incoherent]
Griffin: I think that’s how he joins up with…
Clint: No, I’m serious.
Griffin: Yeah, I think he joins up with the Graysons for this reason, ‘cause he just sees the Graysons as like, “Well, they’re trying to help, and so that’s why I’m here.” This job got maybe a little bit too big just for him to do alone, but the Graysons seem to have their shit in order and can, are doing some good. Or if not good, are helping to balance the city out and, the territory out…
Travis: Some kind of order.
Griffin: Establish some kind of order, yeah.
Travis: So, Ditto, run me through just one the basic levels like, look, Demeanor, that kind of stuff and then we’ll do the intro questions and figure out your Debts. And dad I also realized we did not nail down your Debts, we’ll get back to that in a second.
Griffin: Yeah, so I went with male, and then I want him to be a Latinx dude, which is again, I want to like drive this home, like I do not want to, it would be kind of problematic if it was like he is Latinx and also a big monstrous beast. That is like, absolutely not what I am going for for this character, ‘cause I think that’d be very bad.
But just when I thought about this character being this sort of, you know, community leader and idealistic politician and sort of everything else about him I sort of just envisioned him as Latinx, and then for clothing I had baggy clothing, concealing clothing, dark clothing, dirty clothing. I went with concealing clothing, I’m imagining like a coat with a, some sort of hooded garment underneath it. Which I don’t, I’m not thinking of it as concealing as in like he is embarrassed of being half-transformed all the time, but rather like it helps him in certain situations where there may be, people might have questions about, “Hey, like, why are you half-werewolf, half-human?” where I don’t think he minds answering those questions, but it might be a little bit more convenient when he’s on, like, an investigation.
Like there may be times where it is beneficial just kind of get in, get out unnoticed sometimes. Not that he’s a particularly stealthy character, but I think he likes having the option. And then for demeanor there was; Aggressive—no. Feral—no. Violent—no. And then, excitable? Okay. Okay, if it’s not going to be the other three, sure, let’s— I think he is probably a pretty excitable dude.
Travis: And just, what I also really like about excitable compared to the other three, is like excitable can apply in so many different ways. 'Cause it can be like he’s passionate about his community, and he gets excited at the idea of like, you know, improving something. Or it can be like he’s just enthusiastic about what they’re doing.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: Whatever.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: It’s a good kind of descriptor of someone who maybe reacts to a lot of things in a lot of positive, excitable ways.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Okay, so let me ask you some of the intro questions, right. How long have you been in this Territory and with the Graysons? It sounds like kind of a lifelong territory thing.
Griffin: No, no, ‘cause remember he like moved…
Travis: Oh right, right.
Griffin: He moved here, after his sort of, botched, attempt to shed his lycanthropy. I think he’s only been in Dry River for like eight months or so feels right to me, like I think he’s probably one of the…
Travis: Been in the Territory. Just to keep nailing down the…
Griffin: Yes, yes, sorry. Sorry and in that time he has sort of started to work for the community and learned— or at least started to learn, like, how he can continue to be this like community leader and you know community supporter with his sort of new half-werewolf sort of thing that he’s got going.
Travis: Yeah, so keeping that in mind, one of the questions is what’s the best thing about the change? But I think I’m going to change that a little bit to ask what’s the best thing that came out of the trying to shed the curse? Trying to shed the genetic… part of it?
Griffin: I mean I like the what’s the best thing of the change? Because if I’m talking mechanically, he’s got minus one Heart, and that’s like your Charisma stat. So he maybe wasn’t the best poli— like he wasn’t the most charismatic politician, right? But now he has like a new way of doing things. And that new way actually works for him a lot better than the old way did. So I think in a lot of ways like he has learned a lot more about community and all that since he became a werewolf. So I think that’s why he’s kind of leaned into it, and that’s why he’s not embarrassed of the change and not like anything like that. It is just a different way of being a community leader that is actually kind of better.
Travis: And who’s the most important person in the Territory to you?
Griffin: I kind of left that question up to to you, ‘cause I don’t know about the politics of this town, but I still think he thinks of like the mayor or the governor of the Territory, or whoever’s in charge here as the most important person. And he probably disagrees with a lot of their decisions, he’s probably very opinionated about that stuff, but that’s probably the answer to that.
Travis: Oh I like that, because I like that as a general answer that then we can figure out more specifically as we play, of just like he likes people who bring order to the Territory, and people who are not necessarily in control, because there will be criminal organizations, and you know, business interests, but this idea of like social control order, structure.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah? Okay. What do you desperately need?
Griffin: I think, so again like I wanted to push away from like, he wanted to— also because after talking about our characters, I don’t want it to be the same as Justin’s thing, like he’s not looking for a way to fix this. ‘Cause I don’t think he sees it as something that’s broken. I think for him, like his main drive is keeping his territory safe, which I think can be really interesting ‘cause there’s a lot of stuff in the game about your territory changing and coming under these threats that you’ve established. So I…
Justin: Griff, do you think it’s fair to say then that he, ‘cause obviously he did at some point want to change it, is it fair to say that he sort of like learned a lesson from that? Like, about accepting who he is rather than trying to like, what, is the botched transformation something that changed his mind about that?
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. For sure.
Justin: Like forced him to sort of accept who he was?
Griffin: Yeah, I think absolutely.
Justin: Not to put words in your mouth, but I’m curious what…
Griffin: No, I think that’s a good way of putting it, because I think he now kind of recognizes like, “Oh if I was just still a werewolf that transformed the usual way that werewolves transformed, I would kind of slot more neatly into these like categories that would make it, politically speaking, probably easier to do what I want to do. But now that I’m here, like this is what the situation is and I have had to become comfortable with that too.” But to me that’s like kind of separate from this thing which is like his main motivating drive is his Territory and keeping it safe ‘cause he wants to, he wants to do what he can. Not just to like protect the people who live in his Territory from whatever sort of struggles that are happening in this city between the different factions, but also like the usual city stuff.
Like Dad mentioned the trash being taken out on time, like I think he does think about that stuff, and he wants to make sure that the Territory and Dry River are doing well and that his Territory is benefitting from that. I also want to mention he has, he’s good at like hunting and stuff ‘cause he does have these wolf powers, and that’s his Drama move. Whenever I begin a hunt for someone I mark Corruption. Basically any time that I like lean into my like powers or whatever, it does sort of, it taps into this thing that is kind of against his nature a little bit. That’s not so much necessarily talking about like the political side of things, it’s like his main jam. But anytime he does sort of need to push the limits a little bit of his wolf powers it sort of goes against his nature and he marks Corruption.
Travis: Okay. So Justin, with Augustus we established that there was a Debt to the Church. Two Debts to the Church. And then I assume also a Debt to, you said you were haunting Althiser.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: So there’s probably a Debt there, and then there’s one more, let me find it.
Clint: Can you add Debts as the story goes along?
Travis: Oh yes.
Griffin: Debts are changing constantly.
Travis: That’s what it is, and then those are two of your three, and then the other one is someone or someone’s progenitor was involved in your death, they owe you a Debt. You have, is there anything along the lines of Augustus’s death that is blamed on someone else?
Justin: Yeah, one of the mining companies, we were sort of squabbling over territory, and my belief is, I don’t have concrete proof of this, but my belief is that he had me killed.
Travis: Okay, so maybe to like, keep you quiet about it. They haven’t admitted fault.
Justin: The finest cashew farming land in the area is also very rich in mineral deposits.
Travis: Excellent.
Justin: And he wanted the land for himself, and he couldn’t buy me out because I’m a bitter old man.
Travis: Excellent, excellent. So there’s was a…
Justin: His name is Flint Chittles. [All laugh]
Travis: Wait, that’s the name of the…
Justin: Flint Chittles, you owe me big!
Travis: Flint. Chittles. Perfect. Dad, tell me…
Justin: Do you want to know something weird, Travis?
Travis: Uh-huh.
Justin: I just came up with that name.
Travis: [sarcastically] Nooooo.
Griffin: Can we do that? I owe a Debt to Boop Strongly.
Travis: Yeah. Hold on, let me write it down.
Justin: You guys probably thought I came up with that for a long time, but I just did it just now. Flint Chittles.
Travis: No, yeah that’s amazing, so…
Clint: If it means anything, I believe you, Justin.
Justin: Thank you dad, thank you for believing in me.
Travis: In wizard your Debts, your starting Debts are someone is helping you keep the demons at bay, you owe them a Debt. Someone is your go-to when you get in trouble, you owe them two Debts. And you are helping someone keep a dangerous secret, they owe you a Debt.
Clint: Alright, the go-to when I get into trouble is Chint Flittles.
Justin: Come on.
Travis: Is it Flint Chittles?
Clint: No…
Justin: Stay in your lane. Flint Chittles is…
Clint: Chint Flittles is now…
Justin: Flint Chittles is mine, you can’t also, you can’t steal, you can’t make a parody of mine. It’s not even on Tumblr yet, mack.
Clint: Alright, yeah yeah yeah, okay. I’ll do the parody later. I think it would be more interesting if Michael…
Justin: Now I can’t remember which one is mine, Flint Chittles or Chint Flittles. Thanks, Dad.
Clint: Flint Chittles. I wrote it down.
Travis: So Michael, your homunculus.
Clint: Yeah, my haunted doll. I think that Michael is the go-to when she gets in trouble.
Travis: Excellent.
Clint: And she owes, she owes him two Debt.
Travis: And I think we’ve already kind of touched on that, to say like Michael is your source of information, and so has already, like you’ve already made this promise twice, you know? So like there’s then the opportunity for more Debts to be offered, but we’ve already established that that is why he’s so free with information to you, because you owe two Debts already. So he is…
Clint: And I was thinking, I don’t know who the other two, but I was thinking what if one of either Augustus or Errol has a Debt. Can I have a Debt with one of them?
Travis: Yes. Absolutely.
Clint: Well what I’m saying is she maybe…
Justin: What, hey Dad do you know the job that brought you to town? Just a thought, what if I hired Gandy?
Clint: To help, I was thinking to help Augustus…
Justin: No, to investigate Flint Chittles.
Clint: Oh, okay.
Justin: So I can try to prove that he was the one who killed me. That’s kind of, is that kind of fun, isn’t it?
Travis: Great.
Clint: Yeah, I would love that. So that would be…
Travis: We’ll put that in the first one, so you owe Augustus a Debt. And then, are you keeping someone’s terrible sEcReT? Or if you want to just say someone owes you a Debt for some reason.
Griffin: I can answer that maybe with my Debts. Maybe we can make this the same thing, ‘cause I…
Travis: Yeah, so you go ahead.
Griffin: Yeah, I have someone is hiding you from someone or something powerful, you owe them a Debt. And I thought it would be cool to use that with Gandy, through some sort of magical means because she has shielding magic, she is keeping my presence sort of off the books from somebody back in the old family, maybe back in the town where I’m from, where I started out that I kind of ran away from after things went south. And so for that reason I actually owe…
Travis: Okay so let me help out with this, then.
Griffin: Please do.
Travis: So let’s say because I have in my fiction, there is a kind of head of a criminal, magical criminal organization known only as the Banshee, and you know nothing else about them. They are very, very, secret. No one’s ever met them and lived, but let’s say that in trying to reverse the curse, as it were, Errol made a deal with the Banshee’s organization.
Griffin: Yes, good.
Travis: And then didn’t deliver, and that’s why the halfway transformation has the curse…
Griffin: Yes good. Good and yes. Because one of my Debts is someone is living in your Territory benefitting from your protection, they owe you a Debt, and I think this would be, the woman, a wizard, another wizard who tried this transformation, tried to cast this spell that went wrong, was probably a member of Banshee’s former sort of clique, and was excommunicated.
Travis: Perfect.
Griffin: And so I am trying to keep her hidden in my neighborhood. Her name is Boop Strongly.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Griffin: No, her name is, let me look at a random name generator.
Travis: I liked Boop Strongly, but…
Griffin: How about Dariah? Dariah Cross.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Dariah Cross is her name. She was the one who tried to transform me and it didn’t work out. But there’s no bad blood. And so she owes me a Debt because I am sort of, as Gandy is keeping me sort of hidden from the Banshee, Dariah is also, you know, here. Is that too snake-eating-its-own-tail?
Travis: No no no no, I love this, ‘cause I was going to suggest the second one here is someone hired you for a job, and you fucked it up.
Griffin: I think that’s Augustus, I think I was also hired by Augustus to investigate this, and maybe that— ‘cause you want this team to exist before we get into this story.
Travis: Oh yes.
Griffin: Maybe that’s what first brought us together, and the reason that Augustus doesn’t know whether or not this, whether or not Flint was his killer or not is because I did something during the investigation that fucking ruined the whole thing.
Travis: Okay, we can play with that more because I would love to explore later if you did that on purpose to save Flint Chittles’s life, like you knew that if Augustus could prove it, then the same might be dealt upon Flint Chittles.
Griffin: Yes. So I owe Gandy one Debt, I owe Augustus two Debts, and Dariah owes me one Debt.
Travis: Great.
Clint: So you see this being a 40 episode arc, I’m going to say. [laughter]
{1:12:40}
[Ad Break]
{1:17:33}
Travis: Okay, so I think all of that is a really great start.
Griffin: Well I feel like, can you give a two-minute long sort of overview of the rules? ‘Cause we didn’t even talk about of the fact that there are basic moves that sort of cover all the actions. If you listen to Amnesty all that stuff is virtually the same.
Travis: Yeah so there are basic moves, there are also specific Faction moves you use in investigation or talking to people, and you know I think all of that will become clear when we play. I would rather use it in context ‘cause right now it would just be a lot of words, a lot of hollow, empty words. But I want to read the, I’ve written a thing that’s like the lead up to and go with the action, so we can wrap up here.
Griffin: Okay, I’ll start playing the theme music that I haven’t written yet right now.
[Theme plays.]
Travis: [as narrator] Welcome to Dry River. Back before the drought, we used to call it Twin River. The town was settled on a big spit of land nestled between where the river split and then flowed back in itself. Of course that was back when the river flowed. All that’s left now is the dry bed, just a ravine really. North and south bridge used to be bustling with folks traveling west, who would stop and spend some time in our thriving little town.
Now, folks give Dry River a wide pass. They’ve heard stories. When the water flowed, people came, business thrived, and the Fleshes, the Fangs, and Furs all lived peaceful. Now, every day gets a little worse.
The Fangs and the Furs snarl at each other, waiting for the other to make the first move. The Fleshes just keep their eyes low and hope to stay out of it all. The peace, if you can call it that, was barely holding.
Then tonight, we found Jeremiah Blackwell dead in the street. Jeremiah was the eldest of Joseph Blackwell. Blackwell Senior is just about the most respected Fang in town, not to mention the richest, thanks to the copper mine up north. All the other Fangs seem to look to him when it comes to matters. As if his eldest dying suddenly weren’t trouble enough, it has every sign of an attack of one of the Furs, Dylan Mathis.
Now nobody seems to have seen the murder, but Nick Winstead was leaving the Sterling late last night and found Dylan hunched over Blackwell’s body, Dylan’s clothes soaked through with blood.
The three of you work for the Grayson agency. Grayson agents are detectives, bodyguards, arbiters, enforcers, whatever the client needs. What they ain’t, is lawmen. Abigail Mathis, Dylan’s mother and owner of the silver mine south of town had hired Graysons as arbiters, but didn’t state in the telegram what it is you’d be handling.
You had only just dropped your bags in your rooms above the Sterling when Deputy Rosa showed up to bring you to Sherriff Connors. When Connors first brought Dylan in he wouldn’t shut up about his innocence. Now he’s keeping quiet. Wary. Abigail and Connors have agreed to bring y’all in on this to try to sort it out. It’s midnight now. At 8 a.m. the whole town is going to be awake. Once they find out what’s happening, all hell is going to break loose.
You have eight hours. Good luck.

Travis: Previously, on The Adventure Zone:
Justin: I’m playing a ghost. His name is Augustus Parsons.
Clint: My character’s called Gandy Dancer. She’s a wizard.
Griffin: His name is Errol Ryehouse. He is permanently half-transformed between human and werewolf.
Narrator: We found Jeremiah Blackwell dead in the street. It has every sign of an attack by one of the Furs, Dylan Mathis. The three of you work for the Grayson Agency. Abigail Mathis, Dylan’s mother and owner of the silver mines south of town, had hired Graysons as arbiters, but didn’t state in the telegram what it is you’d be handling. When Connors first brought Dylan in, he wouldn’t shut up about his innocence. Now he’s keeping quiet. Abigail and Connors have agreed to bring y’all in on this to try to sort it out. It’s midnight now. At 8 a.m. the whole town is gonna be awake. And once they find out what’s happening, all hell’s gonna break loose. You have eight hours. Good luck.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Dust Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Travis: Here we are. Episode 1, offish. Um.
Justin: [crosstalk] Wait, gonna roll a—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Wait, the arc is called “Fish” now?
Travis: “Offish,” like “official.”
Griffin: Welcome to The Adventure Zone: Fish. What’s going on under-?
Travis: Fish. No that’ll be the sixth one if I know my alphabet correctly.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: We are doing that, right?
Travis: The next one is “Extravagance.” Um, so, I was just gonna jump straight into the story but last night, as I was figuring stuff out, I came up with a mechanic that I really, really like that I’m gonna share with y’all. Because I set a kind of time limit on the story, I was trying to figure out a good way to like, work that in to the game. So what it’s gonna be is, I have mapped out a certain number of beats in each hour so you can go to different locations. You know, so for example, during the hour of midnight you could go to two or three locations.
Griffin: I love that.
Travis: Then the time will move forward. Now the reason—
Justin: That’s cool!
Travis: Now the reason the two or three is— The other part of the mechanic is you have the option to either completely separate or go to places together. If you go to places together, you only have time to do two. But if you separate, you have time to do three beats. And the problem is if you are by yourself, you are without the faction help and the skills of the other people, but you have time to do more investigating.
Clint: And I’ll miss you.
Griffin: It’s funny that you came up with that independently, because there’s a— I think a Sherlock Holmes Powered By the Apocalypse game. I’ve heard it a couple times on the “Friends at the Table” podcast that has basically this exact mechanic in it. And I always thought it was really neat.
Travis: Excellent. Well, I’m a genius. And to put a little-
Griffin: Or a thief. Or an idea thief. Copyright thief.
Justin: [underneath Griffin] Or a thief. A thief.
Travis: One of those two. No, I definitely did not steal the idea. Came to me last night, in a dream. Um, also—
Justin: While he was listening to his favorite sleeping podcast, “Friends at the Table.”
Travis: To add a little bit more, kind of pressure to this kind of old West, police procedural I’ve written, certain characters will be unavailable during certain times. Either they’ve, you know, gone to sleep, or they are at work or whatever. And certain locations will be unavailable during certain times. So like, if you don’t go talk to somebody in say, midnight or 1:00 to 3:00, you won’t get a chance to talk to them after that.
Griffin: Killer.
Justin: Cool.
Travis: So…
Justin: Everybody’s asleep, also, because it’s midnight to 8.
Griffin: It’s midnight, what are y’all doing?
Justin: That’ll do it, folks.
Travis: So, we’re gonna start in the sheriff’s office and this does not count towards your time. Um, we are probably only gonna get to the midnight beats, I think, in this first episode, because there’ll be a lot more to talk about here.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: So, also! I should also say that in Urban Shadows, usually at the beginning of a session, the players will go around and say who they distrust, what other player character they distrust the least, and there’s a whole thing about setting up, but the Master of Ceremonies has the option to skip that if you’re starting in the middle of a chaotic situation where there’s already a lot of information revealed. So-
Griffin: [interrupting] Let’s do that.
Travis: I’m gonna invoke that just because we already have a lot to figure out. I don’t want to add more stuff to that and complicate it.
Griffin: I'm going to say I don’t like Jeremy, the silent fifth member of the Adventure Zone podcast, who is playing the character of Pervis.
Travis: Take that, Pervis.
Griffin: No, take that, Jeremy, you big donker.
Travis: So, scene: smash cut. So you’re in Sheriff Connors’ office, it doubles as the jailhouse. There are three cells across the backside of the building. In cell number one, which is on the far left as you’re looking at them, you can see a shape that you know is Dylan Mathis curled up on a cot. Dylan is facing away from you, so it’s hard for you to tell if he is sleeping or simply trying to stay as still and silent as possible. Trying to keep himself out of the world. I should also say that you have been briefed by your agency before you came here, so there will be certain things that you already know about the inhabitants and the town, and there will be other things that you will have to search out and find out on your own.
Griffin: I assume you’re gonna tell us the first things when they are relevant.
Travis: Absolutely. And those will be the things that you know from, like, putting a name to a face or that kind of stuff. I can tell you, like, who has the business interests and where things are in the town, but as far as the interpersonal connections and who distrusts who and all the gossip? That stuff you’re gonna have to figure out on your own.
Griffin: Broad strokes, because it’s been about three weeks since we recorded the setup episode, remind me [hesitantly] the Mathises...run the...copper mine?
Travis: Yes, the Mathises are the lead Fur family in town. They run the silver mine. The Blackwells are Fang leaders in town, and they run the copper mine. Sheriff Connors is… the sheriff. His deputy is Rosa, and they kind of constitute the leadership of the Fleshes. But the Fleshes aren’t as— If you think about the nature of a pack or a family, the Fleshes aren’t as tightly knit as either the Fangs or the Furs. So when we start the scene, we kind of start in medias res, as they say, and Connors has been explaining to you that they found Jeremiah Blackwell’s body in the center of town at the intersection that’s kind of like, the main part of town and over him, covered in blood, was Dylan Mathis. So they took Dylan in under the cover of night, there was only a few witnesses and… that Connors was able— Connors and Rosa were able to talk to people and kind of keep it quiet, but they know that once the sun comes up and everyone’s up and getting ready to go to work, they’re not gonna be able to keep this quiet and it’s gonna be out of their hands. So they’ve been able to brief you a little bit about who was there, and we can get into that when you’re exploring your options of where to go next. But when the scene starts, Rosa is kind of nervously looking out the front windows.
Connors: Rosa, come— come away from there. You’re making me jumpy.
Rosa: I-I know, I know, Sheriff, it’s just I’m— I got a bad feelin’.
Connors: Well, yeah. Yeah. Of course you got a damn bad feelin’, there… there’s a murder. Now come away ’fore someone sees you. Alright now, you three. What do you need to know? I want to keep this quiet, and I want to get it done. What do you need to know from me?
Errol: Well first of all, hi. I don’t think we have to be, you know cut— Cut out the pleasantries.
Gandy: Well, I would—after we talk to whoever we’re talking to—I’d like to inspect the body.
Errol: Yeah, I was gonna say looking at the body would be pretty choice.
Connors: Alright, well, we already sent that headed to The Church—well, specifically, graveyard. We don’t really have, you know, a coroner. Michael kind of serves as undertaker and gravedigger and kind of, I guess groundskeeper at the graveyard. But he’s there around the clock, so anytime you want to go talk to him, Michael’s gonna be there.
Gandy: My Michael or your Michael? Oh, you have a Michael too?
Connors: My— my Mich— why would your Michael be there?
Gandy: Well he’s named Michael, so you confused me with your rhetoric—
Connors: [Crosstalk] Okay but like, context clues.
Errol: [crosstalk] There’s lots of Michaels, it’s a pretty common name.
Connors: Yeah, like, we didn’t— okay, people named Connor, I don’t know about Gandy, you might be the only one of them, but anyhoo, while you’re at the church you might also talk to Father Dante. He’s been at The Church all night as far as I know, so he ain’t like, a witness or nothing, but he might be able to give you some kind of information. Uh… Oh, so as far as witnesses go, we know— so it happened like right in front of the Sterling and, by definition there, because of how space works, right in front of the Wild— the Full Moon Saloon, so you might talk to Wilder there. Or uh… you could check in with Isabella at the Sterling. Oh, uh, I— I think you might check and see if Mr. Silver was working late. That’s… he usually does that, that’s right there in the square too…
Errol: Sorry, I haven’t— I haven’t been here that long, um… there’s a dude named Mr. Silver here in the town where he mines silver with werewolves who are allergic to silver?
Connors: Well, to be fair, I don’t know if that’s his real name. His shop is called Silver’s Linings, he’s the tailor in town.
Gandy: Is his first name Hiho?
Connors: …No.
Gandy: That would be funny, though.
Griffin: Gandy owes me a Debt for having to listen to that joke.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: That’s fair.
Augustus: Ah, pardon me, as much as it… mortifies me to interrupt a genuine lawman such as yourself, I do have one query. If we’re…
Connors: Uh-huh.
Augustus: …So hot to find out who killed Mr. Blackwell, then why do I not just ask his ghost, which is standing directly behind you?
[Clint makes spooky laugh noise]
Connors: Uhh…
Augustus: Nah, that’s just a little ghost humor. Hi, it’s a pleasure to meet you. I try to keep things light.
[Clint laughs]
Augustus: One of my classic ghost bits, it’s a pleasure. Augustus Parsons.
Travis: I’m going to take a quick second here to tell you what you know about Sheriff Connors–
Griffin: He loves ghost jokes.
Travis: It will explain to you why that didn’t maybe have the impact you were hoping for.
Clint: Why it didn’t land.
Travis: Yes. Sheriff Connors belongs to a group called the Law. And the Law exists in these unincorporated territories where there is no kind of government established. And the Law is more of like a… a powerful sect, if you will. They are all tainted, but not in the way that you think. They are connected to a demon, but it is a demon whose specialty is justice. But kind of justice in the terms of like, Judge Dredd justice? This is not about right and wrong or morality, this is about the letter of the law, and so with that, he has been granted certain perception abilities. Certain abilities to be able to discern whether someone is lying, [Griffin: Fuck!] it’s not so much a, uh, you know the ability to say, “Ah, the truth is blank,” but more of like, “I get the feeling you’re not telling me something,” which—
Griffin: Can I… can I change characters and play as Sheriff Connors? ’Cause he sounds rad.
Travis: Yeah, it’s pretty rad. And as such, that is why, and because you have to imagine people who come through any kind of sheriff’s office door will say “I’m innocent, I’m innocent,” but there was something about Dylan saying “I didn’t do it” that kind of rang true to Connors’ ears. The only reason— [Griffin: We’re here] he’s giving this the benefit of the doubt.
Griffin: Alright.
Errol: Sheriff Connors, tell me, you got, uh, you got a time pencilled in to hang ol’ Dylan Mathis by the neck until dead?
Connors: Listen, this— it ain’t up to me. I want you to understand that. But there will come a time— there is such a, like, tenuous peace here in town. That, like, there will come a demand and if I don’t, it’s gonna, it’s gonna be bad. For everybody. And it’s— listen. One way or the other, it’s gonna be bad.
Errol: Yeah.
Connors: Either I’m gonna piss off the Fangs, I’m gonna piss of the Furs, or I’m gonna piss off both. And I wanna avoid that at all costs, that’s why I need you. I’m gonna try to keep this quiet, I’m go— but if I’m out there, you know, pounding the pavement, I’m— I’m… I’m gonna draw too much attention to this. I need you all as strangers out there asking questions, but for god’s sake. Keep it. The fuck. Quiet.
Errol: Well why don’t we start off talking to Dylan? ’Cause if he was there, and covered in… some blood, we don’t know whose, probably his, you know, we’re not detectives. Uh, but let’s talk to him and see what uh, see what he’s got to say.
Connors: You can try.
Errol: I mean, you know. Fur to Fur, I feel like we can find some common ground.
Travis: Cool! So you want to go talk to Dylan.
Errol: Wake up, Dylan! Dylan, wake up!
Travis: Dylan doesn’t move. You can see that Dylan is still breathing. So, he’s definitely alive, and that’s about all you can tell from him lying there.
Clint: Is he wearing the same clothes he had on when he was incarcerated?
Travis: Well, he’s kinda taken off his overshirt that was the most soaked in blood, he’s down to like, kind of a… underclothes as far as his top goes, but you can still see that there are some blood stains on it. This was a loooot of blood. I mean, yeah, he was incarcerated about 20 minutes ago. So it’s still pretty fresh.
Justin: I don’t think that— this may not come up, but just for the record, I can be heard and seen now but can’t currently touch or be touched by anything.
Griffin: Fantastic.
Travis: Got it.
Griffin: And he’s not responding as I yell, “Wake up Dylan, Dylan wake up”?
Travis: No. You might have to… let’s say this would be like a hit the streets kind of faction move if you were trying to leverage your Fur… Night faction with his Fur and Night faction.
Griffin: Sure. Is he— is he, I should ask ’cause we don’t really know how werewolves work in this world and it’s midnight, I don’t know if it’s a full moon, I don’t know if he’s in full fur form.
Travis: It is not a full moon, so basically— well, lemme ask you.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: How do you think werewolves work in this environment?
Griffin: I think it’s probably around the full moon. I think it’s like, couple days, and maybe at the full moon it’s like, at its strongest. But I don’t think one night a month they take this form. I think it’s like a couple days before, a couple days after, which is kinda bullshit ’cause that’s kind of the Amnesty rules, but um… I think that makes the most sense to me.
Justin: [crosstalk] We can have coherent multiverse werewolf rules.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, sure. It doesn’t affect Errol, ’cause Errol’s always half transformed, but I think that’s how it works.
Clint: Could it maybe wax and wane with the moon? Like the full moon, they’re full-blown wolf?
Griffin: Yeah, that’s what I’m saying.
Clint: Yeah.
Travis: And I was also thinking, and tell me if this jives with that, Ditto, like that at the peak of the full moon it is a compulsion. You know, that it cannot be avoided, but on the days before and after it’s more of like, “Just be careful, don’t get too worked up.”
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: You know, like that kind of thing of it’s a risk but it’s definitely controllable, especially for elders, you know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah yeah yeah.
Travis: They’re a little bit— but when you’re looking at like, young people, with all their hormones and hula-hoops, it’s a lot harder for them to control.
Griffin: Yeah. Their yo-yos and their Pepsi Colas. Lemme hit the streets to try to wake this lil’ dude up.
Travis: Cool, gimme a roll.
Griffin: That is a six plus one, a seven.
Travis: Great. So… that’s a mixed success, so you hear:
Dylan: [quiet, moody] What do you want?
Errol: Um, I wanna keep you from gettin’, you know, massacred in the middle of town when everybody wakes up. How’s that for an answer there, Dyl?
Dylan: I can’t… I can’t.
Errol: “Can’t”— “can’t’s” just a… “won’t” with a pretty face on it.
Clint: With a C-A.
Errol: No, listen, that’s nothin’. Dylan, you–you… I don’t care how you feel about it, you’re actually the only one who can in this situation, so… Um… I need you to get up and just come talk to us, I’m not gonna force [Dylan: She wouldn’t…] you to do nothing you don’t— What?
Dylan: She wouldn’t want me to. I promised.
Errol: Who’s? I don’t know who you’re talking ’about Dylan, you can’t sorta start a conversation in the middle of a sentence, bud.
Dylan: I’m just so tired…
Errol: Yeah I mean it’s midnight, we’re all pretty tired, but um… there was a murder?
Augustus: I’m not! I don’t sleep.
Errol: Yeah…
Augustus: I’m a ghost.
Errol: Yeah, fantastic.
Augustus: Specificity in all things, young man, specificity.
Errol: Dylan, listen.
Dylan: Leave… me… alone.
Errol: Well no, I’m not gon— I’m not gonna do that. You’re like, in a little cage, and so I can just stand here and talk all night if you want. My buddy here apparently doesn’t sleep, so he— he could— he could keep that going for… god, I don’t know, eternity, Gus?
Augustus: Yeah. It’s uh… It’s Augustus. And also, yes. I could also—Look, I’m in your cage now. This could get very annoying for you very quickly.
[Clint laughs]
Dylan: I’m not saying anything to you.
Errol: To which one?
Dylan: Any of you.
Errol: Oh.
Dylan: Leave… me… alone.
Travis: So the mixed success here, just to be clear, is you did find out something, right?
Griffin: “She” wouldn’t want this.
Travis: Right. But he’s not gonna give you much more than that. You can try to persuade at this point, but it’s gonna be a pretty high roll…
Griffin: Yeah, can I try something else?
Travis: Sure.
Griffin: So I have a thing called Bloodhound. When you hunt someone, roll with Blood, on a hit you know exactly where to find them and follow their scent until you do.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Griffin: Can I use that to, in full-blown sort of werewolf, wolf instinct-style, sort of get the scent of the blood on his shirt and, if it leads me to him I know it’s his. And if it leads me to The Church I know it’s Jeremiah.
Travis: You got it.
Griffin: ’Kay. That is a seven plus two Blood, nine.
Travis: Okay, so it definitely doesn’t lead you to him.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: It leads in the direction of The Church. But—
Griffin: Okay, shit.
Travis: But it’s hard to track kinda that far out? Church is outside of town, but you can just— it is definitely leading away from him.
Griffin: Okay, so— but I could follow the scent and figure out where it goes and find out whose blood it is, so at least we’ve got that—
Travis: You would, but I mean, that would be you know, a beat, you know what I mean?
Griffin: Right, sure sure sure, sure sure. I’m just saying now we have two pieces of information.
Errol: Alright, anybody else want—
Travis: You have a piece, and let me say, and I don’t think this has been a thing that we have pushed in any of our arcs up ’til now, you probably wanna take notes.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: There’s going to be a lot of information.
Griffin: Also, a wolf Corruption move: When you start a hunt for someone, mark Corruption, so I think that I just did that.
Justin: Hey, first corruption!
Travis: Yeah! Hey!
Griffin: I thought for sure Augustus was gonna be… alright. I have one Corruption.
Travis: And you can spend that at our store right outside the gates. This is the information you have, right? I’m gonna fast-forward a little bit and just kinda collect. So here at the start, your options are, this is what sheriff tells you, right? The Sterling is an opportunity, you know that that is the vampire kind of hangout tavern in town, it is also the casino. Then there is the, and this is another thing you know from your briefing, Isabella Slate is now the proprietor of the Sterling, she took it over from a man named Marcus two years ago. Marcus disappeared mysteriously, and basically Isabella kinda turned power back over to the people working there. Marcus was not a good person. So the Sterling is a possible beginning location, the Full Moon Saloon, which is the werewolf hangout tavern. You could also head to The Church and the graveyard, The Mathis home, and Silver’s Linings, to talk to Mr. Silver.
Griffin: We were brought— we were brought on by the Mathis matriarch, right? It was her—
Travis: Correct, Abigail Mathis hired you.
Griffin: ’Cause that— that’s the only she I could think of that would be the obvious sort of answer here.
Justin: Well, let’s give it a shot.
Clint: Gandy really wants to take a look at the body.
Griffin: Nasty.
Clint: Since her… you know, her skillset is in the analytical, magic kinda thing. I really think she is— feels a compulsion to go look at the body.
Griffin: Yeah, let’s get— that’s— police work 101, get the clues before you…
Justin: Get the clues.
Griffin: Before you start talking—
Travis: You gotta talk to the coroner, find out about the autopsy.
Clint: Gotta slide over the hood of a car.
Griffin: Yeah, let’s head to The Church.
Errol: Alright, we’re gonna go to church, do some Hail Marys and crack the case.
Connors: Alright, um… we’re gonna be here. So feel free to stop back by here anytime if you need to bounce anything off of us or need any guidance or anything, we’re gonna be here, we’ll see what we can get outta the boy. And if you need us, just let us know.
Errol: Yeah that sounds— Oh shoot. Hey, Augustus, are you even gonna be able to go in The Church? I don’t know if there’s some sorta like, holy warding or something that keeps you outta there.
Augustus: I can, I just don’t enjoy it. But to be fair, that is no change from my life.
Errol: Alright. We’re going to church.
Travis: So as you make your way through town… the town doesn’t feel right. It feels tense in that way that it— it might just be completely placebo, but in that way that buildings and wood seems to absorb the negative emotions of the people within it and kind of bleeds through like a whiskey as it picks up the flavoring of the barrel. And so as you move through town—
Justin: Hell yeah, that’s evocative as fuck!
Travis: Thank you. You have a hard time not looking over your shoulder. You have a hard time not keeping your eyes on the windows to make sure nobody’s watching you. And as you leave town and make your way toward The Church about 50 yards outside of the— the last houses, it eases a little bit. You can see all around you the ravine of the Dry River. In the distance you can see the mountains. You can see the stars and the sky and it starts to loosen up, but still at your backs you can feel the tension. And you’re just breathing a little easier out here, and then as you approach The Church, you see above the door the symbol of The Church, capital “T” capital “C.” That’s all we got out here in the Crescent Territory is The Church. It isn’t exactly a specific religion or denomination, it’s just a group trying to spread some sort of morality. And then you have two options as you approach The Church: you can either head into The Church and talk with Father Dante, or you can head into the graveyard and look for Michael.
Errol: Graveyard, right Gandy?
Gandy: Absolutely, let’s go and see what’s shaking baby.
Augustus: Now that— these are my people.
[Laughs]
Travis: So as you head into the graveyard, it’s silent as… the grave.
Griffin: Hmm!
Travis: But you can see in the middle of the graveyard—
Justin: Less evocative.
[Griffin laughs]
Travis: Yeah, you can see in the middle of the graveyard a small house with the lights on inside. The lights are flickering, it’s very clearly either some kind of lantern or candles. I assume you want to approach?
Griffin: Yeah, imagine me kind of uh… I wanna keep following this— following the wafting scent of the pie through the air as I follow the scent. Is it heading towards that house, or?
Travis: Indeed it is.
Griffin: Alright, let’s keep following the stink lines.
Travis: As you approach the door and raise your hand to knock, the door opens before you can make contact.
Michael: Ah, Gandy, Gus, Errol, was it? Come in.
Errol: Uh… Y-yeah. It’s E-R-R-O-L, I know a lot of people on [Griffin chuckles] Twitter have trouble with that. Yeah, thank you.
Michael: Absolutely. Come in, come in.
Travis: And you see before you a very broad and frankly beautiful man. He has a warm smile and kind eyes, and immediately like, gives you a feeling of peace? That’s only slightly thrown off by his blood-stained apron and gloves.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s one of my main turn offs, is if they’re covered in blood.
Travis: When you enter, you can see laid out on a slab is— is Jeremiah Blackwell. You can tell that Michael has been in the process of cleaning the body and preparing it for funeral rites.
Augustus: Sorry to bother you sir, could we take a look at the steak? We’re conducting an investigation.
Michael: Oh, no bother at all, I expected you. Of course, of course. But… [laughs] it wasn’t a stake, that’s archaic. It was claws.
Errol: No, I think he meant like, S-T-E-A-K, like the meat.
Augustus: Yes, this has all made me very hungry, this appetizing environment.
Michael: Of course.
Augustus: No, I meant the— so— see, here I thought, serves me right for believing all those fantasy novels, I thought they could only be killed with a stake through the heart. Bear in mind, I’ve never attempted it.
Michael: Um, I mean they can pretty much be killed same as you or me— well… same as a regular person I should say.
Augustus: F— no, well, that’s very kind of you, sir, thank you. So few people take into account my phantasmagoric nature.
Michael: I make the same mistake about myself all the time. It’s so easy to forget.
Augustus: Indeed.
Gandy: Can we— can we pick this up, please? I am very, very uncomfortable in this setting?
Michael: Of course… [crosstalk]
Gandy: [crosstalk] With all this uh…
Michael: After your parents’ death, this was probably very unsettling for you.
Errol: Okay, uh, I gotta st— I gotta stop you right there, bud. Are you like, some sort of psychic, what’s the— what’s the— what’s your whole deal? We are very very short on time, and I love sort of the spooky thing you got going on, but we need to get to the bottom of it as fast as possible.
Gandy: Well, let me help, let me help. I would like to Figure Someone Out.
Travis: Okay.
Clint: I would like to Figure Michael Out. I roll with Mind?
Travis: Go for it.
Clint: Alright, I’m rolling with Mind… and it is—
Justin: A zero! [laughs]
Clint: A nine plus two for Mind. So it’s an 11.
Travis: So… Michael is giving you incredibly strong immortal vibes. Now this is an option for NPCs only, so this is an old one, an angel, a god, something along those lines. But Michael is most definitely and has never been, not like, not human, has never been human, isn’t fey, isn’t Power, isn’t Night, isn’t anything.
Griffin: Something else. Well, he also, I have to ask—
Justin: He’s his own thing.
Griffin: He has to ask two questions as part of Figure Someone Out, right?
Travis: So let’s say that’s one answer. Give me another question.
Clint: Okay.
Gandy: What do you, Michael, what are you afraid might happen from this situation?
Michael: I worry about the people in town. It’s not their time.
Errol: What’s their time? Michael, I just wanna cut to the quick here. What’s the— what’s your— what’s your deal? You some— you uh… you some sort of… eldritch sort of deity? What— what’s— what are you?
Michael: No, no, nothing… Nothing quite so… unseemly. I make sure that they move from one side to the other seamlessly when it is their time.
Clint: Oh shhhhhhit.
Griffin: [laughs]
Clint: Gandy is not digging this guy at all. He’s Death! He’s like the boatman, the— aw, f—
Griffin: Shit.
Clint: Oh fuck a duck! No!
Travis: Now, those at home who may have studied theology will know that Michael is the name of the angel of death!
Clint: The archangel of death.
Griffin: Yes, so that works.
Clint: Yeah, oh, wait a minute. Gandy goes in the corner of The Church and barfs.
Gandy: Oh, god. Ohh god.
Michael: I’ll… clean that up later I guess?
Gandy: [groans]
Michael: Gandy, it’s not your time.
Augustus: You vomited through me.
Michael: You have nothing to fear from me.
Gandy: [tense] Mmhmm… I— I— listen, my friend, it has nothing to do with fear. I hate you. Sorry, it’s just— I can’t— it— compulsion—
Michael: Absolutely, I understand.
Augustus: Maybe, perhaps Gandy, you should begin your investigation on the body, see what you can derive.
Gandy: Ugh, f— fine. Fine, yes, okay… Um… Yeah, I’ll go over and… check out the deaaad body. This is not my wheel—
Travis: You wanted to come here, Clinton!
Gandy: This is not my wheelhouse! This is not—
Travis: You said you were anxious to get here!
Griffin: You were so— you were dying to get here.
Gandy: [not really in character voice?] I was, I was, but I didn’t know Death was gonna be hanging out!
Travis: You knew there’d be a dead body, you can’t be like, “Eww, gross!“
Gandy: Well a dead body’s already dead. Ugh…
Justin: While— before this, or during this, or whenever, I’m not picky. I uh.. I would like to commune with some ghosts…
Travis: Okay.
Justin: I’m gonna Hit the Streets with the ghosts that might be inhabiting this graveyard.
Travis: Mmkay.
Justin: Seems even money that there’d be some hanging around.
Griffin: I like this. Can we all take one action, right? If we’re like, exploring this place.
Travis: Yeah!
Griffin: I wanna talk to Michael whenever it’s… whenever the other two boys are done.
Travis: You got it.
Griffin: Okay. Who wants—
Justin: Alright, I’m gonna do mine first, so… Hit the Streets I roll against, what was it?
Travis: So you would be rolling—
Justin: Okay, so I’m rolling Night.
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: That’s ghosts, right?
Travis and Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Oh, cool, I got a nine plus… two, so 11.
Travis: Okay. Let’s see.
Justin: To be more specific, I don’t know what ghosts are here, but I’m— I’m kinda wanting to go out into the graveyard, look up some ghosts, see who I can scare up—
Travis: [Acknowledging pun] Ahh.
Justin: See if they saw anything.
Travis: Okay, so as you kind of, I assume, well you describe. What do you do to commune with ghosts?
Justin: I float out into the graveyard and I extend my hands up into the air and say
Augustus: Are there any ghosts here?
Griffin: If so, I want to do them!
Travis: And you feel a tap on your shoulder.
Justin: Mm, no I don’t—
Travis: You do.
Justin: I can only be seen and heard.
Travis: But another ghost could tap you right on that there shoulder.
Justin: You are fucking playing Calvinball with ghosts rules, my man, but I’m into it, that’s fine. You can put a little English on this ball if you like.
Travis: Well, so I mean—
Justin: Yes, I am tapped on the shoulder by a ghost—
Travis: My assumption was when you’re talking about seen, heard or felt that that was to the corporeal world. But does that apply to—
Justin: Yeah, but why— that would imply that the spectral plane has physics of its own.
Griffin: I love it, dude, that’s that Soul Reaver shit.
Justin: I’ll grant it yes. Okay yes, I am tapped on the shoulder by a ghost.
Ghost: Hi! You—
Justin: If only so someday I might be able to fight a ghost.
Ghost: Yeah so—
Clint: Oh yeah!
Ghost: Do you need a— do you need some help there, fella?
Augustus: Uh yes, what’s your name? I’m Augustus Parsons, pleasure, from the Parsons Cashew Company.
Ghost: Jonathan, pleas—
Augustus: Sorry? Jonathan, pleasure.
Travis: And you turn and you see a man, a little bit grizzled, but with a twinkle in his dead, dead eyes. Um, a warm smile, but an eyepatch across one of said dead, dead eyes. And y— other than that, pretty nondescript as things go. Five-foot-eight. Um, y’know? Fairly regular looking person.
Jonathan: Um, is there something I can help you with?
Augustus: So I’m investigating a murd— were you alive during a, uh, the— the uh— to encounter any of the Blackwell family?
Jonathan: Uh yeah, I’m um, very familiar with the Blackwell family. But I— I have to tell you, if you’re looking for information, I’m— I’ve been here about 10 years… So I— I don’t know how much help I can be.
Augustus: Well, I understand that, but one of the Blackwells, Jeremiah, was uh, took a little poorly tonight, by which I mean he was murdered. And uh, we— there was a blood trail leading this way to The Church. I was just curious if you had seen anything… unusual tonight.
Jonathan: Well, I mean, honestly, that does explain a few things…
Augustus: Go on, I’m all ears.
Jonathan: Well I— I, I didn’t know who it was— I— it was just in passing. Um, you know, I— after you’ve been here awhile, you get kinda attuned to things? I felt—
Augustus: Sure.
Jonathan: I did feel, you know, a ki— a— a spirit move from here to there if you know what I mean. And— and the— mm, the overwhelming feeling was [sighs]
Travis: And you can see him kind of squirm, like he’s trying to… pin down that feeling in his body.
Jonathan: I— I’m— I’m sorry, it’s been a long time since I, you know, felt in the human way, you know what I mean, so I’m trying to—
Augustus: Of course.
Jonathan: I was— confusion? Betrayal? … It wasn’t— you’d expect a murdered pers— you’d expect anger, sadness, but this was just… confusion.
Augustus: So, you’re thinking maybe the… they weren’t prepared for the attack. Sort of came out of nowhere perhaps? Were they confused by the assailant?
Jonathan: I mean, hard to pin down. Might be both? Uh… you know I didn’t— I didn’t talk to the boy, I just felt. Uh— and all I—
Augustus: And you didn’t see anything, perchance?
Jonathan: No, unfo— I mean just, not from here [chuckles]. Just— just felt the spirit go.
Augustus: All right. Alright, well, Johnathan, I will let you return to your eternal slumber, I’m sorry to have uh, disturbed you.
Jonathan: Well it’s been a pleasure. It’s rare I get to talk to anybody, so…
Augustus: Well I gotta go, thank you so much!
[Griffin laughs]
Travis: Alright, so let’s cut back in to… Who wants to go next? Errol or Gandy?
Griffin: Gandy, why don’t you go?
Clint: Well, give me some advice here. I’m— I— if I’m investigating a body… if I’m checking out the body, I’m not sure which of the moves applies to that.
Travis: Well, so this is—
Clint: There’s an Investigate a Place of Power…
Travis: No, I can tell you what this is. So, in Powered by the Apocalypse and— and specifically, I don’t know if it applies to Monster of the Week as well, there are certain things that like, you can do. Like, I know that Gandy has studied this, she is very learned, so this is not so much a move so much as just a things she’s doing. So I can give you information, I don’t think that this is a challenge you have to overcome so much as just— this is like, if you wanted to sit down and eat a sandwich, I wouldn’t make you roll for that.
Griffin: Yeah, but if you have any kind of like, magical abilities that you could— would wanna enhance this investigation, that would be [Travis: Yes.] probably a— a move.
Clint: Yeah, I want Gandy to look at the body and investigate the wounds—
Travis: Okay.
Clint: But I don’t— but you gotta tell me what I see, Trav!
Travis: I will tell you what you see, for I am the Master of Ceremonies! Um, so, what you see is you see um, two like, kind of cross-sections, and because I can’t think of a better way to describe it, like Wolverine’s claws? Have been pulled across his gut.
Justin: I’ve solved it.
Griffin: Okay, hold on—
[laughter]
Travis: And those wounds, though fairly razor sharp, very clearly went deep. And he bled out his— his uh— Michael has packed his internal organs back into the wounds, but he [Griffin: Yuck.] was eviscerated.
Errol: Yeah, okay, that kinda does look like werewolf stuff, if I’m being honest. And that’s… not great for us, I don’t think.
Travis: Um, so. Do just a straight up and down investigation— what’s your Mind, Clint?
Clint: Plus two.
Travis: Okay, so do an investigation roll plus Mind for me.
Clint: ’Kay… That would be eight plus two, 10.
Travis: Great. So… what you can see, as you investigate past just kind of surface level, is along, um, kinda the edges of the— the wounds there’s some trace of like, metal dust? Some kind of powder. And it’s— um, ok— it looks to be a mixture of silver and copper. It’s hard to tell exactly which of the two it is, I mean there’s dirt in the wounds too, but there’s definitely a glint to it.
Gandy: I would like to take a sample of this— these scabs or whatever they are, back to my Sanctum Sanctorum to do a little bit of… checking maybe? Maybe getting to the bottom a little bit? I have uh— [clears throat] an assistant there who might be able to tell me a little more.
Travis: Okay, so that’s, um, just so you know, if you go back to your Sanctum, that’s gonna be like, your beat for the next one, you know?
Clint: I’m cool with that.
Travis: Great. Um—
Justin: Hey can we— for the— for the, um… essence of like, for efficiency of storytelling, can we just assume that if we derive information from any of these sort of little beats, that we have passed that information along to our cohorts, to save us [crosstalk] from like, reiterating everything?
Travis: [crosstalk] Yes. Absolutely, yes, yes. Um, and then uh, so we go to Errol.
Griffin: Yeah, um, I wanna talk to Michael.
Travis: Absolutely.
Errol: So uh, you… you deal with the dead here, in uh… in the Dry River, right?
Michael: Yes, um, by definition that is correct.
[Gandy makes grossed out noises]
Errol: I don’t really know how it works. I don’t know if you got some… big hourglass or something counting everyone down. I haven’t been at this very long, but I kinda understand this is uh… well it’s wet work that we’re doing here. And before we go any further with this investigation, I think it’d be helpful to know… You, uh… you got any idea of whose time’s gonna run out tonight?
Michael: It’s… not quite that easy. I see… stretched before me… three different possibilities. And the problem is… if I were to give you any information… about those three… I would affect… which three came to pass. And I am not permitted to do so. I can only… discuss the present and the past with you. I’m sorry, Errol, I want to help. I want to give you the information that I can. It saddens me to see Jeremiah here.
Errol: Yeah, it’s a bummer. Um…
Griffin: I want to try to persuade just to ask one specific thing.
Travis: Go for it.
Justin: Yeah, persuade an angel. [laughs]
Clint: [sarcastic] Should be easy.
Justin: [sarcastic] Should be easy! No— should be— should be no problem.
Griffin: That’s— okay, are we, uh, so, I have a territory that I have named Carrion Street, which is kind of like the residential area of, of Dry River, and that’s where I have my cool bonuses and stuff. [Travis: Uh-huh.] I ass— I assume we are not in Carrion Street.
Travis: We are not.
Griffin: That is a seven minus one. That’s gon— that’s gonna be a six. But I still wanna ask the question and he can tell me to fuck off.
Travis: Okay!
Errol: Can you at least tell me, Michael, in how many of those three possibilities… how many of ’em does Dylan Mathis live through the night?
Michael: I can’t tell you that. But what I can tell you… is in all three of them, you succeed.
Errol: Well that’s fucking great news! All right! Well, um—
Michael: Success as you may well know, Errol, isn’t always the outcome you expect.
Errol: Well don’t take the wind outta my sails, you just gave me a nice little confidence boost there, Mike.
[Laughter]
Michael: I will… give you one more piece of information. But in exchange I will need help from you in the future.
Griffin: He wants a Debt.
Errol: Yeah, uh… I’m uh, you know I’m the helpful sort. What do you— what do you got for me?
Michael: When I… was cleaning the body… I couldn’t find any trace of fur… on him.
Errol: Hmm… Maybe one of those nude werewolves. Um, okay, uh… that’s— that’s, well that’s great news and it’s also kinda confusing news. But uh, I appreciate the help there. [Music fades in] Keep uh, keep a eye out for a— s— say a little prayer I guess? That might be—
Michael: Of course.
Errol: That might be weird, you are an angel, you’d be praying to yourself or somethin’.
Michael: That’s… not how prayer works, but I’ll get right on it.
{45:21-50:18 ad break}
Travis: So you now have one more beat in midnight. Now, here you can separate into a group of two and one, or all stay together.
Justin: Well we’ll need to do two and one for Gandy to go back and do her research, yeah?
Travis: Yes.
Clint: And Gandy wants to take the body with her—
Travis: Nope!
Clint: Is that possible? Okay, then…
Travis: I should say— [Clint: Tell mee-] in character, Michael would not allow that.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s wild.
Travis: Yeah. Not— that’s not just me being like, “I— uh— no.” It’s— that is the only duty Michael has is to shepherd… uh, people as they cross, and like, that would go against everything.
Clint: All right, then I have— I have something I wanna do. I think it would be, actually, a— um, a magic spell. I don’t— it’s not necessarily—
Travis: Ooh, a magic spell! Go on.
Clint: Wizard spells. Yeah. Not Zone of Truth! [Justin snorting] Not gonna go there.
Griffin: I mean, that’s barely a spell.
Clint: [Sheepish, small voice] Could I— could I do Zone of Truth…?
Travis: No.
Clint: No, okay.
Justin: [Copying small voice] Is— a thing don’t rush to judge from here {???}
Clint: No I— What I want to do is I wanna take as much information to… my, uh, my assistant. My… homunculus. Um, I had this idea of maybe Gandy would have these— what are they— how do you pronounce it? Pince nez? The little— glasses that— that you know, go on your nose. [Justin: Mmhm!] You know what I’m talking about?
Travis: Yes.
Justin: Mmhmm.
Griffin: I have never heard this word in my life.
Travis: It— [crosstalk] you need to read Poirot, Griffin.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, I know exactly what you’re talking about.
Clint: Pince-nez, which is… pinch nose. Uh, that are— are actually an artifact that when she puts them on, they kind of take in data about what she’s looking at, and she can take that back to, uh, her assistant and have him analyze stuff and— and give her some ideas. Is that workable?
Travis: Dad, here’s what I will give you because that was not [Clint: Okay.] one of the artifacts you wanted [Clint: Right.] but just to uh, kinda make… transferring information a little easier, we’re gonna say that those are Michael’s pin— Pince nez, that you can then [Clint: Mmkay.] put back on him when you return and it just transfers everything you saw to him.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: And that will save us on exposition.
Griffin: It’s a homunculus flash drive!
Clint: Cool.
Travis: Yeah! I was thinking more of like, a homunculus GoPro, but.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Clint: Well then, I’ll take that— I’ll take that and some of the scabs from the wounds.
Travis: Perfect.
Griffin: Yuck.
Travis: You take a few scrapings and— and do a good sweep of the area. So Gandy’s gonna head back to her— her Tower of Power. What’s it called?
Clint: It— Sanctum Sanctorum.
Travis: And what’s—
Clint: The Black Mariah, the Black Mariah.
Travis: The Black Mariah, and what’re Errol and Augustus going to do?
Justin: What do you think, Griff?
Errol: We could go talk to the Mathis matriarch, but um… seems like we should have our ducks in a row before we sorta confront her about her son’s potential murder.
Augustus: That makes sense. Makes sense to me.
Errol: He was killed outside the Sterling, right? Maybe somebody there saw something that could help us out?
Augustus: Well… that’s possible. I— I would worry, though, that Sterling, being a house of ill repute, might be more inclined to… discretion than uh… than the patrons of the saloon.
Errol: Yeah, I mean, Full Moon Saloon, those’re— those— that’s my folks there, so we might have a better chance of getting some actionable info there, so.
Augustus: Indeed.
Errol: Alright. Also, I’m— I’m thirsty as heck, and they got a root beer there that’ll knock your socks off. It would probably fall right through you, which is a dang shame…
Augustus: Mmhmm, ah, speaking of. Give me a moment.
Justin: Augustus is going to be— heard and felt, but not seen.
Travis: Creepy.
Justin: Hey, I gotta pick two, baby!
Errol: Yeah, Gus, you gotta warn me when you do stuff like that pal, it is disconcerting to have somebody just vanish right in front of my eyes.
Justin: Augustus is silent.
[Laughter]
Errol: Excellent.
Augustus: I’m still here!
Travis: Oh, god. Let’s resolve Gandy’s first. So, describe to me, and our listeners, the inside of your Sanctum Sanctorum.
Clint: It’s a Black Mariah, is what it was called, it’s a very large. In this case, a very large one that police used to use to collect prisoners.
Travis: Yes, but what does the inside look like? I want to know, is it like, you know, like, Tesla coils and Frankenstein, you know machines or is it like, potions?
Griffin: Do you have a Fronken— do you have a Fronkensteen?
Clint: Um, she calls it a— her Labrary. It’s part lab, [snorting laughs] part library. Um, there are a lot of books… there are a lot of… of artifacts laying around. It’s… there’s a— almost— it’s almost divided in two. There’s like a main part full of books and, and artifacts, and then there’s the— a— a secondary part that is… laid out with like a, a table for doing work and for alchemy and for analysis and stuff. And there’s a chute at the very front with some steps that the homunculus, who is also… who is also the carriage driver, can clamber up and down and still have access to all of this. I’m thinking very much like the— the train car that James West used in the TV show The Wild Wild West.
Travis: The only canonical Wild Wild West.
Clint: Ah--In my book, yes. And— her, she has this assistant, I mentioned before the homunculus, but now since I have to change his name…
Travis: You don’t have to change his name!
Clint: We’re not gonna have two Michaels in the show!
Travis: In the real world people have the same name.
Clint: That— that’s true, but this is not the real world!
Travis: People go to the bathroom, they have the same name…
Clint: I have a nickname—
Justin: This just happened on, uh, Terrace House: Boys X Girls Next Door, where another Te-chan [sp???] showed up at the house, there was already a Te-chan, so they called him, uh, Oji.
Clint: Well that’s—
Griffin: Which means prince, which is the most wild. “I’m gonna call you prince now.”
Justin: And he actually says like, “I would prefer you not call me prince.” And then literally next scene everyone is calling him prince.
Clint: Well Terrace House was my inspiration for this.
Griffin: Good, good.
Clint: Um, actually—
Justin: The illegal fan du— subbed Terrace House: Boys and Girls Next Door was Dad’s inspiration.
Clint: She has this homunculus that is— basically is a homunculus is a doll or an artificial construction, sometimes possessed by something else. So she calls him Uncle Oni, he’s about two feet tall, he’s a bunraku puppet. And bunraku puppets are these elaborate, beautiful puppets that have been an art-form in Japan for, for centuries and centuries. And this is possessed by a demon, and Uncle Oni is very powerful, and we already know that she has a Debt to Uncle Oni. And that’s who she goes to when she needs advice.
Griffin: Is this something— y— you said in the setup episode that Gandy was like a world traveler, is this— is this something that she picked up while like traveling in Japan, or?
Clint: Yes, absolutely, yeah. She has artifacts from all over that she’s found as she is— and it was particularly interesting to her the fact that basically a demon is alive after death, and so this is kind of one of the ways, here you have a disembodied spirit placed back into a form, that was very interesting to her.
Griffin: Yeah, I think that’d be interesting to pretty much anyone.
Clint: Yeah, that’d be interesting.
Griffin: I would be fascinated by that.
Travis: Okay, cool, so I’m going to say… You can ask three questions of Michael a day. Right? So you can’t just keep coming back here. This is what your Debt to him— this is the arrangement that you made. Or, to Uncle Oni, ’scuse me.
Clint: Uncle Oni.
Travis: So you can come ask three questions, but once you’ve used those three questions, you’re done for the day. And I think that those questions Uncle Oni is going to have final say as to how much information your Debt has earned you? And I’m also going to put the limit on them that they’re going to be who, what, where, when and why questions.
Clint: So Gandy walks into the Black Mariah, there are like wards and, and things that would keep people out. She goes into the— the back part and calls out.
Gandy: Uncle Oni! Uncle Oni!
Uncle Oni: Yes?
Gandy: Hello—
Clint: And Uncle Oni visually has this sweet cherubic li’l fat li’l face, but when Uncle Oni—
[Griffin groans in apprehension]
Clint: When Uncle Oni is in kill mode—
Griffin: Yeah—
Clint: It switches to this really awesome mask.
Griffin: I was really—
Justin: This is a— this is a hostile action on your part, Dad. The—
Griffin: Yeah I was really—
Justin: A hostile action you’re— you’ve taken against me.
Griffin: Uh… I’ve seen— I’ve seen some pictures of some pretty scary looking puppets like this…
Clint: Yeah.
Uncle Oni: Do you have a question for me, Gandy?
Griffin: Travis, what is this voice?
[Clint laughs]
Travis: You know how sometimes you open your mouth and like, a voice comes out? I think that’s the voice of the little, like, forest wizard character from, uh, I’ve only seen on Mystery Science Theater 3000 of like, Jack Frost? And there’s the character and he turns the character into a bear? ’Cause he, like, doesn’t carry him. I can’t remember, but that voice has always stuck with me.
Clint: I thought it was reminiscent of Coily from MST3K.
Travis: [High-pitched, energetic] No springs!
Clint: No springs.
Griffin: Yeah, let’s lean into Coily, I like that.
Travis: Okay!
Uncle Oni: What can I do for you, Gandy?
Gandy: Uncle Oni, I’ve brought some scabs for you—
Uncle Oni: Disgusting!
Gandy: Uhh, these are from a wound—
Uncle Oni: [quizzical] MMmmm…
Gandy: And I want to, I want to ask one of— one question, my— today’s question. What is this substance in the wound? What is this powdery substance?
Uncle Oni: Well, give me my glasses and let me look.
Clint: I hand Uncle Oni his Pince nez, and they look really cute on his li’l face, and pops ’em on and is looking through them like they’re some kind of VR kinda thing.
Uncle Oni: Mmm…
Clint: And I also put the— the scabs down on one of the— the tables.
Travis: Now, I, listen, I’ve watched enough police procedurals, I do need to correct you here. You wouldn’t get scabs on a dead body. You’d get dried blood, and you would get powder, I just don’t want anyone tweeting at you…
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: Okay, William Petersen, here you go, here’s your dried blood.
Travis: I’m just saying… dead bodies don’t coagulate.
Griffin: I need to know if Uncle Oni ever says “enhance”—
Uncle Oni: Enhance!
Griffin: While looking at the blood.
Uncle Oni: Ah, what is this? Mmm, let me see. [Thoughtful clicking noises] Yes, ah… This is refined, processed silver. It has been mined from the local mine— this is local silverdust.
Gandy: From the area?
Uncle Oni: Yes.
Justin: So it’s both local and from the area…
Travis as Uncle Oni: Yes.
[Clint laughs]
Justin: That narrows it down.
Uncle Oni: Gandy, do you have any other questions?
Justin: Hi, I’m another puppet in your paddywagon that’s just there to get on your nuts about stuff.
Clint: It’s a ventriloquist dummy that just sits there. Okay.
Gandy: No, Uncle Oni, I’m going to save my other questions. You can dig right into the dried blood if you want.
Uncle Oni: If you’d like, I could just tell you who did it,
Gandy: No. No, that takes all the fun out of it. You know me, I’m all about gathering information.
Uncle Oni: Okay, just know I’ll be here if you want to exchange me… any more of your soul.
Gandy: I know…
Uncle Oni: I can just tell you.
Gandy: Uh, no, I’ll hold off. Getting rid of my soul, I’m not quite prepared for that… and I’m getting a little nauseous just thinking about it. But, I need— may I wear your Pince nez again.
Uncle Oni: Of course! Do come back and see me.
Gandy: And let me tell you one thing: This situation is extremely dangerous, and I know we’ve been through some dangerous times before, for those of you who don’t remember the prequel, Gandy Dancer and Uncle Oni in the— the Pits of Despair. So be prepared, be ready, um, this is a very hostile situation, I would hate to see anything happen to my Sanctum Sanctorum.
Uncle Oni: Oh, I will protect it, and what will you give me?
Gandy: Well, I actually was concerned about you, so that’s the only reason I suggested…
Uncle Oni: If I lose this form, I just find another.
Gandy: Not without my help, you don’t.
Uncle Oni: Oh, the hubris. I will look forward to being free from this body.
Gandy: Go ahead. Hope springs eternal.
Uncle Oni: We shall see…
Griffin: [smiling] Can we do another scene or are you guys gonna just keep dropping one-liners on each other?
[Laughter]
Travis: So, let’s move on to Errol and Augustus. You are heading to the Full Moon Saloon, is that what you’ve said?
Griffin: Right.
Travis: When you arrive at the Full Moon Saloon, it is now… let’s say about 12:30? And it’s a school night, so there’s not a lot of people there. You see the bartender Wilder: an older fur, he’s gone gray, he has a gray beard, um, long but well-kept. The bar is clean, he is well-dressed; aged, but still clearly— he could kick your ass if he needed to. At least you, Errol, maybe not Augustus. Are you corporeal at this second, are you touchable?
Justin: We’ve covered this.
Travis: Okay.
Justin: I’m corporeal, but I’m invisible, basically.
Travis: Got it. So until you speak, and let’s make sure we keep this in mind, until you speak, it’s possible that no one knows you’re there.
Griffin and Justin: That’s the idea.
Travis: That’s the idea. Um, and also sitting at this bar there are two women. They are not sitting together, they are fairly far apart, it’s clear that they are not with each other. But one you recognize as your employer Abigail Mathis.
Griffin: Shit! Okay. Uh—
Justin: I’m gonna float over to Abigail Mathis, not float, I guess slowly walk. How— it— within earshot.
Travis: Mmkay.
Griffin: Yeah, are they having a conversation when we walk in? Or is she just drowning her sorrows right now?
Travis: Well, she is both drinking but also waiting. I think she kind of expected you sooner.
Griffin: Uh, I walk up to the bar and sit down at the stool next to her, and I say:
Errol: Lemme get uh, two root beers— I— lemme get one root beer, please. Uh, and you can put it on the Grayson’s tab.
Abigail: About. Goddamn. Time.
Errol: …No need to take the Lord’s name in vain, Abigail. We’re out here you know, busting our humps trying to find out what we can find out.
Abigail: It— [sighs pointedly] My son has been locked in that cage for almost an hour. You better be close to solving this goddamn thing.
Errol: Wheels of justice turn pretty slow and that root beer is… Listen Abigail, here’s what we know: your son’s covered in blood, and we found out that it is Jeremiah’s blood. And he’s got claw marks across his gut, and we can’t just release your son, he’s the most likely suspect still, so I know you’re frustrated and everything, but—
Abigail: My son would not do this. He is a good boy, he would not have done this.
Errol: He’s a good boy, but he’s a shit suspect. He wouldn’t really tell us much when we were in there talking to him.
Abigail: He— he always has been quiet.
Errol: Yeah, that’s agai— and not super helpful and again that root beer though? Is it…? What are you do— you brewing the sarsaparilla back there? What’s the—
Travis: Wilder just kinda glares at you and continues polishing cups.
Errol: What’s— you— you got beef, bud?
Justin: Wilder watches one of the mugs floats over to the root beer and begins to fill itself.
Errol: I’m doing that with my mind.
Justin: It is placed in front of— in front of Errol.
Travis: Wilder reaches underneath the counter and pulls out a club with a silver tip, and you can see engraved upon it is the symbol of The Church, and he points it—
Justin: You see the mug start to float back over and upend itself, and the— then it goes over to the sink and is washed and is placed back in its place.
[Clint laughs]
Wilder: Show yourself, ghost.
Augustus: First off, I have a name.
Justin: And I materialize in front of him.
Griffin: What two?
Justin: So I— what? I can be… seen and heard, but not felt.
Griffin: That’s a good call in this situation.
Augustus: We didn’t come for any trouble, my good man. We are here to investigate a terrible crime and to free one of your lupine brethren from the shackles of injustice. We just need a moment of your time, and we’ll be on our way.
Travis: In fact, I’m gonna say he sounds like this:
Wilder: Get behind my bar again and you won’t be walking out. Or—
Augustus: Well…
Wilder: Should I say floating out?
Travis: And he kinda like, give you a bit of a smile-glare. He smiles, but not with his eyes!
Griffin: Ahh, there he is! There he is! He’s smizing.
Augustus: I appreciate the concessions made to my phantasmagoric nature. Not the threat, but I do appreciate that you recognize that I am a ghost.
Errol: Alright I’m gonna give up on Operation Root Beer. Abigail, listen, when we were talking to Dylan—
Augustus: Now I’ve almost got it cracked, give me a second.
[Laughter]
Errol: When we were talking to Dylan, he’s— mentioned something about “her”… not wanting— not wanting him to talk. Just curious if you ah, you know who that might be.
Abigail: I can tell you there’s only one “her” Dylan cares about, and it’s his sister.
Errol: Lemme add that to the old clue book. What’s ah— what’s the deal there, are they close?
Abigail: They are twins from the same litter…
Augustus: What’s her name?
Abigail: Ann.
Errol: Where might we find Ann here at this late hour?
Abigail: Probably still asleep back at my house.
Errol: Well I may need you to go wake her up and get her— get her here in town, ’cause we got— we gotta ask her some questions.
Abigail: Do it yourself.
Travis: And she slides you the key.
Abigail: I need to be here, center of town in case something happens. I’m not leaving my boy.
Errol: Abigail, I feel like maybe you don’t really understand the situation that we find ourselves in.
Travis: You see the back of Abigail’s arms start to get a little hairier, her nails start to grow, and she turns and glares at you and says:
Abigail: No, I don’t think you understand, Errol. I am not leaving my boy. He is next in line to take over my place. I am not. Leaving him. Alone. Do you understand me, Errol?
Errol: Yeah, I understand, you don’t wanna lose your boy… But things go south here, you’re gonna lose a lot more than that. The gravity of the situation is this, and I’m surprised, ’cause I would think [music fades in] somebody who’s been living around the mines for as long as you have would know a powder keg when you saw one. This town’s about to blow up. And… we’re trying to stop it. We’re— we’re on the same side here, we’re just asking for a little bit of help.
Abigail: You stop it. I’m Plan B.

Travis: Previously on The Adventure Zone:
Connors: We found Jeremiah Blackwell dead in the street. It has every sign of an attack by one of the Furs: Dylan Mathis.
Jonathan: You would expect a murdered person to— you would expect anger, or sadness, but this was just confusion.
Travis: Like Wolverine’s claws have been pulled across his gut.
Augustus: I’ve solved it!
Griffin: Okay, hold on.
Travis: There’s some trace of, like, dust. Some kind of— it looks to be a mixture of silver and copper.
Mrs. Mathis: There’s only one “her” Dylan cares about and it’s his sister.
Augustus: What’s her name?
Mrs. Mathis: Ann.
Errol: Er, where might we find Ann, here at this late hour?
Mrs. Mathis: Probably still asleep back at my house.
Errol: I’m surprised, because I would think that someone who’s been living around the mines for as long as you have would know a powder keg when they saw one. This town’s about to blow up and we’re trying to stop it.
Mrs. Mathis: You stop it. I’m Plan B.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Dust Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Mrs. Mathis: Listen, Errol, when I brought you here, it was because I needed your help dealing with— There’s a deal in the works between me, the Blackwells, and the workers, to try to get an arrangement — an agreement — on paper that’s beneficial for everybody, and we are so close to nailing it down. It’s the only way we’re gonna be able to save our collective businesses. And this could ruin it. This could tear it apart. There’s a lot on the line here, Errol.
Errol: Yeah, I know all about deals. There’s got to be somebody who’s getting maybe a slightly shorter, less delicious part of the stick. Uh— that was a bad analogy, and I’m not saying that sticks are delicious but— who do you think might be— this thing that’s happening. It sucks? And it sounds like whoever did this wants this deal to come crashing down around all of y’all, so, you got any idea who that might be?
Mrs. Mathis: The three main players in this are me, Joseph Blackwell, and Liam, but I trust Liam. He’s kind of the unofficial— official spokesman for the workers, but he’s also a Fur. I trust him.
Errol: [sarcastic] Yeah, I mean Furs definitely can’t do bad things to other Furs. That’s in the Bible.
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Errol: Okay, here’s what I’m gonna do. We’re gonna keep doing our investigation, we’re gonna keep poking around, we still got some time till—
Griffin: I check my watch. Is it one?
Travis: It’s getting close. This is like the end of this first beat.
Errol: It’s almost one, we still got some time. We’re gonna keep digging our nose and you know… following our nose, following the clues, and see what we can dig up, but— Where am I gonna be able to find you, you gonna be here all night?
Mrs. Mathis: I’ll be here or I’ll be at the jailhouse.
Errol: All right. Uh.
Mrs. Mathis: Talk to Ann, I think she’ll be able to help. Liam’s there too, he said he’d keep an eye on the place and make sure nothing went wrong while I was down here.
Errol: Yeah we’ll go— we’ll go sniffing around, see what we can find. Ahem. I’m sorry I’m sick, that’s why I sound like this. I don’t normally sound like this. I don’t normally sound so gruff, I have a chest cold. That’s a little werewolf joke.
Travis: She just stares at you.
Errol: All right, well. Hmm. Mighty thirsty, but I guess nothing can be done about that, so. You about ready to go, Gus? Oh sorry, do you want to go clue hunting? You’ve just kind of been doing some root beer pranks.
Augustus: I think you’ve done a marvelous job. I wouldn’t dare to impinge upon this fantastic investigation that I’m getting to witness secondhand. What a thrill. You know us elderly people love to watch procedurals—
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Augustus: So it is uh, it is quite a thrill for me.
Travis: I will remind you, there is another person here, another woman at the bar.
Errol: Why don’t you hit them up, Gus, see what they got?
Augustus: Pardon me, other woman at the bar. Pleased to make your acquaintance, I am—
Travis: You do have a faction move called Name to a Face, that maybe you might want to use instead of addressing them as “other woman at the bar.”
Justin: Okay, I’ll roll against— wow, what a weird move, okay yes. But yes, why not? I love a good faction move.
Griffin: This is how we level up, too, with these faction moves.
Justin: How do I level up with a faction move?
Griffin: When you take four faction moves with each of the four factions you level up.
Justin: Oh, okay, cool. Uh, what’s their—
Travis: She is Night. Night, specifically Fur, but because— because Gus is neither Fur nor Fang it’s just Night for him.
Justin: Uh, well, I’ve already done a faction move with a Night. Uh, anywho. I rolled a [laughs] I rolled a five and I have plus two with Night— uh no, sorry— yeah, plus two with Night, so it’s a seven.
Travis: Okay, uh, it’s Marie Jacobs. You know that she is is a Fur, you know that she runs the depot, which is, you know, the shop in town, you know that she stays pretty neutral as far as things go because she trying to do business with everybody, and that’s about all you know about her.
Augustus: Pardon me Ms. Jacobs, if I could steal a moment of your time. I am the spectral form of the man who was Augustus Parsons of the Augustus Parsons Cashew Company. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Ms. Jacobs: Uh yeah, charmed.
Augustus: Glad to see manners have not been completely extinguished here in this... dusty wasteland. I was inquiring into the murder of a young vampire this evening and I was wondering if you might have seen anything out of sorts.
Ms. Jacobs: I mean, uh. Listen, uh, I’d kind of prefer to stay out of it, you know. I’m doing my best to just make a living, and I need business from the Fangs and the Furs and the Fleshes and everybody.
Augustus: Well, ma’am, I do understand the impulse but you see that this matter of the highest import for both your people and the vampires. Plus, I can assure you that any information you give me will stay within my confidence. I will, if you permit… stay as quiet as the grave.
Ms. Jacobs: Well, uh, that’s not very evocative, but I—
Griffin: How come we gotta give evocation reviews to every spoken word in this—
Justin: I thought that was fairly evocative.
Griffin: That was fucking evocative as hell!
Travis: But when I said “silent as the grave” last week, Justin gave me a hard time!
Justin: Yeah, but like...I’m a ghost, so it’s like—
Clint: [laughs] It resonates!
Justin: So it’s hysterical.
Griffin: Those were his words.
Travis: J-man, give me a persuasion roll or something along those lines. Something you want to do.
Clint: Mm, persuasion rolls. Mmm…
Justin: Do we have persuasion rolls?
Griffin: Yeah, to persuade an NPC you roll with heart. On a hit they do what you ask, on a seven to nine, they modify the terms and/or demand a debt.
Justin: That is a— oh shit, a 10! Oh hell yeah! Nice.
Travis: Sick.
Griffin: Plus heart?
Justin: Zero. Heart zero.
Clint: He’s a ghost, he doesn’t have a heart, he’s dead.
Travis: Oh no, you gotta go talk to The Wizard.
[Clint giggles]
Ms. Jacobs: All right, listen. Here’s what I know, all right? One: Dylan’s a good boy. I watched him grow up, and I can’t believe he would do this to Jeremiah. They always seemed to get along so well. The three of them— them and Ann— they were thick as thieves. They grew up together, they never had any problems. I can’t— I can’t believe Dylan would do this. He was here, shortly before— I mean, minutes before. Suddenly he perked up, ran out the door. That’s all I know.
Augustus: What was he doing before he ran out the door? Was he alone, was he speaking with anybody?
Ms. Jacobs: No, he was just here doing the same thing we’re all doing, just drinking.
Augustus: Yeah.
Mrs. Jacobs: Just sitting quietly and trying to find a second’s peace.
Errol: Some of us aren’t able to drink because of reasons beyond their, sort of, understanding.
Ms. Jacobs: Do you mean because he’s a ghost?
Errol: No because they won’t give me one, a root beer, it’s all I need in the world.
Ms. Jacobs: Wilder, give him a dang root beer. Grow up.
Griffin: Mission accomplished! Goodbye guys! I’ve finished.
Clint: Ladies and Gentlemen, this has been Dust!
Griffin: Errol Ryehouse’s weeks-long quest.
Travis: Now Griffin, Wilder slides it down the bar, I’m going to need to you to roll to see if you catch it.
Griffin: That’s a… four? That’s a four.
Travis: You catch it but all the root beer sloshes out of the glass.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: No! God! Please!
Justin: The show continues.
Griffin: I kind of embarrassed, like, mime drinking the root beer out of the empty cup. Okay.
Travis: And Wilder just kind of, you know, massages the bridge of his nose.
Augustus: Can you think of anybody who would’ve had it in for Jeremiah?
Ms. Jacobs: Honestly no. It was a good crop of kids, you know what I mean? I can’t— I mean, lots of people have things against the Blackwells, but nobody seemed to have anything against Jeremiah specific.
Augustus: Tell me about Ann a little bit. We have not met her as of yet.
Ms. Jacobs: Ah, smart girl. Probably the smartest one of the bunch. She’s, you know, kind and… she’s a Mathis, but she ain’t a Fur. She’s Flesh… You wouldn’t know it, the way they take to her. I mean, she’s family of course, so.
Augustus: Sure, yeah.
Ms. Jacobs: She spends a lot of time hanging out with Jeremiah, and Dylan of course. They grew up together. She’s about as good as they come.
Augustus: You seem like a sort of woman who keeps her ear to the ground, who knows things, who sees things. Give me something I can work with, please.
Ms. Jacobs: If somebody’s trying to tell you that this was done in anger, that Dylan attacked Jeremiah out of hate or whatever, there ain’t no way that’s true. There wasn’t bad blood between the two of them. And if this was done in anger, it was anger towards the Blackwells, or anger towards the copper mine owners, this wasn’t because of Jeremiah, there’s no way.
Augustus: All right, well… Ms. Jacobs I will leave you to your brew, and I thank you for your time.
Ms. Jacobs: Pleasure.
Griffin: Do we hear a clock bell— clock tower bell or something?
Travis: BONG.
Griffin: I don’t know if they do that at night, that would be very annoying I feel like.
Travis: They don’t, that is not how that works, but let’s say Augustus has a spectral timepiece.
Griffin: A Yo-Kai Watch, if you will.
Travis: [beat] Sure.
Griffin: God, that was a good joke that was wasted on you fucking plebs.
[Justin & Clint laugh]
Travis: All right, so that brings us to 1-3 [a.m.]
Griffin: Wait, we’re doing two hours in this one?
Travis: Yeah, so you’re gonna get to pick more beats— two to three— same amount of beats, really.
Griffin: We— yeah, we trust you. Can you— can we take a second, because we kind of jumped into the episode, run through the clues real quick for the folks at home? I have ’em all written down here [crosstalk] just sort of the salient stuff.
Travis: [crosstalk] Sure! Go for it.
Griffin: Some “her” didn’t want Dylan to talk, we’re assuming it’s Ann, his twin sister who is not a Fur.
Travis: Yes, they are fraternal twins, and a reminder, genetics-wise they’re codominant genes, so she just isn’t [a Fur]— I actually did research to make sure fraternal twins did not share DNA.
Griffin: Fantastic.
Clint: And that’s Ann?
Travis: That is Ann.
Griffin: Yes. The blood on Dylan’s clothes was Jeremiah’s, led to The Church. According to the ghost in the graveyard, Jeremiah was confused and betrayed when he was killed. He had claw marks across his gut that had silver dust from the local silver mine around it. We’re going to succeed in some way in this thing, that’s less a clue and more just sort of a little reminder, a little “Hang in There” kitty poster I have up on the wall. There’s a deal that was— okay, the rest of this stuff was from five minutes ago, so you don’t need to hear that again. Can you give us a list of where we can go now? ‘Cause we have the option, right, of sticking together or splitting up again I imagine.
Travis: Yes, so there is the Mathis home, where Ann and Liam are. There is the Sterling, which was the last place that Jeremiah was seen. You could head over to Silver’s Linings. You always have the option to head back to the sheriff’s station to check in with Connors and Rosa. The Church with Father Dante, but you were just there, so I mean, do you really wanna walk all the way back there? No, I think for now those are the kind of ones you’ve been pointed at.
Griffin: Mmkay.
Travis: There’s other areas, but you don’t have any, to use a technical term, leads that would point you towards them, so unless you just pick one—
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: So where’s—
Travis: Hm?
Justin: Where’s Ann?
Travis: Ann is at the Mathis home, Ann and Liam.
Griffin: In the Mathis house, which we have— which we have a key to. I—
Justin: I feel like—
Griffin: I was of a mind that we should wait until we had more clues before we went there, but I think we have enough time that we could maybe take two trips, and it seems like—
Justin: Well, that was when you thought that Abigail was gonna be there. You wanted to—
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: But we sort of ran into her organically.
Griffin: Good point.
Justin: So maybe we should just go.
Griffin: We should head up there. I also think maybe we should split up, ‘cause I think the Sterling last known location is something we should also pursue.
Clint: At this point Gandy has rejoined the party, right? We’re all together making this decision?
Travis: Yes. In this— you remember, this is the center of town, right? So I assume, ’cause you’re staying at the Sterling, you’re working— so the Black Mariah is probably parked right there. I mean, you’re all within 10 yards of each other.
Griffin: I would like to go to the Mathis household just because I am a werewolf kind of, and I— I don’t know, there might be something that I can use there to find something out. That’s kind of, my inclination.
Justin: I was thinking I’d like to go to the Sterling, which is the last sort of place that Jeremiah was seen.
Clint: That’s where Gandy— Gandy would like to go there, too.
Travis: If you split up in any way, one and two or one and one and one, you only get two beats. So you do get the added bonus, Gandy, of being there and contributing, but if you want to cover more ground in the 1-3 range, you might want to completely split up, but it’s completely up to you. I am just reminding you how the mechanic works.
Clint: I mean, Gandy just had a scene by herself and I—
Travis: Super cool, absolutely.
Clint: I’d like her to interact with one of her partners—
Travis: You don’t have to explain yourself to me, you’re doing great. Who wants to go first? Errol, or Gandy and Gus?
Griffin: How about Gandy and Gus, since Gandy hasn’t done anything this episode yet.
Justin: Sure.
Travis: Excellent.
Justin: I’m gonna go invisible again.
Travis: When you walk into the Sterling, it has a completely different feel from the Full Moon Saloon. Where the Full Moon Saloon was, to use a modern terminology, more of a, you know, well-polished and very clean dive bar, the Sterling is sparkling. There’s metal accents everywhere, the gambling tables are clean and well-kept. And it has the smell, and if you’ve never been to a casino it’s hard to describe, but the smell of a well-oiled and clean table and clean machines and just smells like money. And you can tell that the focus, whereas in the Full Moon Saloon the focus was “have a drink and forget,” here it’s “take a risk,” you know, “feel alive.” And so when you enter, a couple of things immediately draw your attention.
One, is the woman who isn’t really working the bar so much as she’s just at the bar, on the customer’s side, but clearly in control of the whole building. And you know from your intel that that is Isabella Slate, the owner of the Sterling. She has owned it for the last two years after the previous owner, Marcus, mysteriously disappeared. And when Isabella took over, she turned the whole thing around, it didn’t used to be this house of chance and, you know, risk. It used to be incredibly poorly run, I would say, and bad. Nobody went there, but now the Sterling is the destination in Dry River.
The other thing you notice is there’s only, with it being such a late hour, there’s only one kind of table that’s actively being used. And there’s two people that, you know, just regular humans, but the one that draws your attention is the spectral gambler, who you know to be Em. She has quite a reputation in the area as being a card shark. And her stack is about five times the size of anyone else’s at the table, so you can tell she’s kind of been running the table all night.
Griffin: Please interact with the ghost gambler.
Augustus: No.
[Griffin laughs]
Augustus: I’ve already done a Faction move with her Faction twice. I’m not— no longer interested.
Gandy: [whispers] Augustus, Augustus. Augustus...
Augustus: Yes, Gandy.
Gandy: Look around. Look… very… carefully. Is this place not the bomb? Is this not the coolest thing you’ve ever seen!?
Travis: Why would Gandy say “the bomb”?
Augustus: Why would you say “the bomb”?
Gandy: Because it’s—
Griffin: She can say it’s dynamite.
Gandy: It’s— it’s dynamite, look at this! [Gasps] And there’s a ghost! A ghost gambler! I’ve gotta talk to her. I’ve got to. I’ve got to talk to her.
Augustus: You’re impressed—
Justin: Hey, I did want to clarify something. To what extent are people of this world hip to ghosts? Something I should have clarified before I tried my Ghost Dad stunt in the last one. People like— I’m not gonna be able to run many ghost scams on people of this world, yeah? Like they kind of know what’s up?
Travis: Well, yeah, I don’t think you’re gonna surpri— like it’s not gonna be like, “What?! A ghost?!” But I think that not everybody can perceive you. Had you not moved the mug, then they probably wouldn’t have put two and two together. Um… yeah.
Justin: Okay, that’s all I needed to know, thank you.
Augustus: Well yeah, Gandy, see what information you can obtain. I actually… You know, I’ll watch.
Gandy: Okay, great! [clears throat]
Clint: So she walks over to the table— what game is being played at the table?
Travis: It’s poker.
Justin: How… crazy would you say this particular game of poker is?
Travis: Thank you for asking, Justin. I would say that it didn’t begin as crazy but it has become a crazy game of poker.
Justin: Now if you could repeat that for about eight minutes.
Travis: Well right now it is a crazy game of poker but when we talk about it later we’ll say it was a crazy game of poker. We’ll get there, you know.
Clint: So many references. Okay!
Griffin: Sorry, should we talk about Steely Dan— is there a Steely Dan poker song?
Clint: I’m sure there is… Um, actually there is.
Griffin: Okay, okay, okay, I didn’t mean to send you down a fucking rabbit hole.
Justin: We’re going blackjack, do it again…
Griffin: Okay, fine. Fair.
Clint: Okay, so Gandy sits down at the table, and, um—
Gandy: Can I get some chips please?
Travis: Em points over to Isabella and says:
Em: She’ll give you the chips, go talk to her, don’t talk to me.
Gandy: Oh, um, I’ll be right back.
Clint: She runs over and gets a bunch of chips.
Griffin: I love the idea— the visual of Gandy being very very rich and so she doesn’t know how much is a good amount of chips and so she gets way too many chips.
Gandy: Pardon me, I would like to purchase a … hundred? dollars worth of ghost chips?
Travis: Isabella smiles.
Isabella: Yeah, that sounds great. That sounds just… right. Here you go.
Travis: And slides 100 dollars in chips over to her and takes her money.
Griffin: Is this a lot of chips? This seems like a lot of chips.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yes it is. Yes. For this time period, 100 dollars? Yes. That’s quite good.
Clint: Well, Gandy has a great per diem, so it’s all right.
Travis: When you sit— when you sit back down at the table, Em’s spectral eyes just light up! She sees in you... quite the mark, and she turns to the two people playing with her, and says:
Em: Uh, yes, excuse me, could you two just give us a second I think I need to have a talk with this young woman now. Um, we’ll get back to the game, don’t you worry.
Travis: And they kind of grumble and stand up and they go get a drink at the bar.
Em: Young lady, is there something I can do for you?
Gandy: Well, I was just interested in participating in this game, and I’m just— I’m very excited. I love games. And I thought I’d take a crack at this one and see what I can do.
Em: Well I’ll tell you what. How ’bout, we’ll increase the excitement. You put— We’ll go —it’s called in the business— “all in.”
Gandy: “All in?” Okay.
Em: Yes. You put that stack up, and I will, uh, what do you want from me? That’s what I want from you, what do you want from me?
Gandy: Oh! Well, um, I just would like to get to know you. I’d like to maybe, uh, learn a little bit about what’s going on in here. That’s my secondary goal, my secondary goal is to kind of find out about what’s going on in town here, but my primary goal is to play this game. These, uh, tiny little pictures with the people with crowns on them, is there a significance to the crowns?
Travis: She smiles even bigger.
Em: Here, I’ll tell you what. How about we make this deal. If you win— well, if I win, that stack will become mine. But if you win, I will answer, mm, I’ll answer three questions.
Gandy: That sounds great! Let’s play. How do we start?
Travis: [In Em’s voice] Well, Clinton, you’re going to do a straight up-and-down roll with no bonuses. [Normally] No, she doesn’t say that. I’ll say that.
Clint: I was going to say, that was a little meta there for me.
Justin: Here’s the thing, though, I was going to help him cheat.
Griffin: Ooh.
Justin: Because I can see the cards, so I was going to poke Gandy with some hints. So, if you’re going to do a straight up-and-down roll, I’d like to be able to lend advantage somehow.
Travis: Okay, we’ll do a plus two. Well, okay, here’s what we’re going to do. So, Justin, you roll first, and your roll will determine how much you’re able to help.
Justin: Uh, I got a nine.
Travis: Okay cool, so let’s say you add a plus one to whatever Dad rolls.
Clint: And I rolled a 14 and a nine, so that’s 23.
Griffin: What?
Justin: [simultaneously] Whoa.
Travis: Two d6s, and you got a 14 and a 9?
Clint: D6s.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Come on.
Clint: It was a joke! It was a hilarious joke! Good God.
Travis: I wish I could believe that was true, but…
Griffin: I don’t know what to believe anymore.
Clint: All right, here we go! All right, she’s rolling. It’s a four and a four, so straight up roll that’s an eight, and then plus one with what Augustus added to it.
Travis: So I’m gonna say, you push. You tie, basically. So you don’t lose your money… you’re going to go double or nothing.
Gandy: Double or nothing! I need more chips.
Em: Okay, well, I’m sure—
Gandy: Does that mean I have—
Em: I’m sure you’re good for it. And if you win this one, we’ll do… five questions?
Gandy: Okay, great.
Griffin: That’s so many questions.
Augustus: That almost sounds like too many questions.
Em: And you won’t have to use them all at once.
Travis: Uh, Justin, do you want to cheat again?
Justin: Yeah! And that’s an eight, this time.
Travis: Okay so once again we’ll say plus one.
Clint: ’Kay. It is a six and a four, 10.
Travis: Great! So that puts you at 11. So, you win! Uh, Royal Flush, I dunno, fuck it.
Clint: So they all have crowns. Look, they all have crowns and they’re all the same color. That is…
Griffin: Well, the 10 wouldn’t have crowns but it’s good.
Clint: Oh, that’s good. Okay, got you.
Em: Well shit.
Gandy: Aw.
Em: All… all right. No, good play. Listen, I love the game, you know? Don’t hate the player, that’s what I always say. Um.
Gandy: One more! One more time, please! Please please!
Griffin: For ten questions! [cracks up]
Gandy: Just one more hand! One more hand! Please!
Travis: No, I think—
Gandy: I’ll put up 500 dollars in ghost dollars. 500 dollars in ghost dollars!
Travis: Gus, do you want to say anything here?
Justin: I, uh, I mean, I don’t want to blow up my spot. All right. Okay, I’ll, I’ll, yeah, I’ll manifest.
Augustus: Aw, darn, and I was hoping my ghost friend would win. Hello. My name is Augustus Parsons, I am the spectral form of the man who was once known as Augustus Parsons of the Augustus Parsons Cashew Company. It’s a pleasure to make your uhh… phantasmagoric acquaintance.
Em: Yes, hello, my name is Em. I am the ghost of Em, the gambler.
Augustus: Fantastic. Not to disagree with my compatriot here, and Gandy I hope you don’t mind me stepping in. I do think that five questions is probably quite enough.
Em: Well, let’s get to it, I’ve got more games to play. What are said questions?
Augustus: Well, I’ll let Gandy explain. You and she seem to have built up quite the rapport.
Gandy: Well, what I was curious about… This big deal that everyone’s talking about, is there anybody who’s maybe not happy about it, who doesn’t want to see it all come together, I mean… I know that it’s probably good for the Furs, and it’s probably good for the Fangs, but what about everybody else in town?
Em: Aw, child, don’t you know anything about compromise and gambling? At the end of the day, if you’ve done it right, nobody’s happy. If people walk away from a table happy, it means that somebody’s losing. So you gotta make it so everybody walks away feelin like they got something, so they come back to the table, but they can’t really win, or else they feel like they’re done. Do you understand?
Gandy: Yes.
Clint: She adjusts her pince nez [pronounced ponce nay]— By the way, that’s how you pronounce it, because she looked it up in the book of faces. It’s an information outlet—
Travis: Ah. I assume it’s a book made out of face skin.
Clint: Yes, and everyone has a little picture of their face, it’s very—
Griffin: So many questions.
Gandy: Tell me somebody who doesn’t want this deal to happen.
Em: I don’t know off the top of my head, to be honest.
Gandy: And I can see the top of your head! That’s really interesting, how I can do that.
Augustus: Yes, I was curious. Have you, uh, did you see, uh, Jeremiah Blackwell in this establishment this evening?
Em: Yes, he was here. He was in good spirits— heh heh— get it? And, you know—
Augustus: Thank you, I do appreciate that very much. Thank you very much. I did not respond as quickly as I should have. That was excellent, thank you.
Em: Thank you. Uh… Everything seemed fine, he, you know, said he was celebrating, didn’t say what. Um, everybody seemed in good cheer, nothing seemed amiss. He walked out of here alone. He’s here pretty much, you know, five or six nights of the week, honest, and mostly doesn’t drink as much as he did tonight, mostly it’s just kind of a nightcap, as they say, but tonight he seemed to be, uh, tying one on a little bit, and walked out of here alone about 11… I don’t know, late, close to midnight, a few minutes before. Nothing seemed amiss at the time. And then all of a sudden, around about… shortly after, few minutes later, we could hear Dylan screaming, crying out, um, went to the door, and there he was, over— over Jeremiah, covered in blood.
Gandy: When he was in here drinking, was he by himself?
Em: Um, yeah, he— I mean as by himself as you are surrounded by people, but he didn’t come in with anybody, didn’t spend time with anybody in particular.
Gandy: Was he celebrating, or commiserating?
Em: Celebrating. Now that is five questions, so thank you very much—
Griffin: [disappointed] Oh my god, you guys.
Em: Have a good night.
Augustus: I only did one, so I can’t really be blamed.
Travis: She turns back to her game, the two gamblers— she sort of motions back and the game begins. Now, Gandy, you feel a tap on your shoulder. You turn around to see the redhead sitting at the bar that you know is Isabella Slate.
Isabella: Um, I couldn’t help but notice that you were talking about the murder of Jeremiah Blackwell. I’d love to help if you’d welcome it.
Gandy: Well, of course. Do I need to cash in these chips? ‘Cause I have a shitload of them.
Isabella: Well, I’ll tell you what. How about you just hold onto them, and you can use them in the future, we’re not going anywhere. Well, I have some information that I think might help you, but you need to come next door with me to my house. Both of you.
Gandy: Can I— Can I get a to-go cup? I’m a little dry.
Isabella: A traveler? Yes, of course.
Augustus: Always take a traveler.
Isabella: Always take a traveler.
Gandy: Oh, good, good. I’d like a traveler, please.
Travis: You get it. She gives you a sippy-cup of whisky or whatever.
Gandy: Tequila! Tequila please.
Travis: And you go next door— Gus, if you agree, we’re going to go next door. And it’s not going to count as another beat, this is all going to be tied into the same beat, but first! Let’s go check in with Errol.
Griffin: Can I establish something? This is a house that people live in, and we’ve talked about Carrion Street as being like, the residential neighborhood? Is it possible that this is in— I really haven’t done anything with the neighborhood stuff, and so I’m wondering if—
Travis: This is the Fur neighborhood, and we’ll say that they live on Carrion.
Griffin: That’s Carrion like C-A-R-R-I-O-N. Which is not like—
Travis: Yeah, it’s not like “carrying,” yes, I got that.
Griffin: Which is not like, it’s not like, I don’t think it’s a bad place, as much as the name suggests, I think it was called that before Errol got here and tried to turn things around.
Travis: Yeah, so the way I’m kind of envisioning Errol’s territory, and tell me if I’m off-base here, is like within the Crescent Territory in each town there is a Fur territory, and that then kind of fits into Errol’s purview, so here—
Griffin: See, I almost like it better if it’s almost not exclusively one— one— And it’s your game, your world, but like, I almost like it better if just like, if it’s actually some folks crossing the— crossing the boundaries a little bit? Maybe it’s primarily a Fur territory, or maybe that’s how it started out. But like, I like the idea that this is a nice neighborhood because of Errol’s, like, stewardship, and so maybe—
Travis: Absolutely.
Griffin: Maybe that makes it so it’s not exclusively one type of people living here.
Travis: And I should say, it didn’t come up in the conversation but, in my kind of head-fiction, Abigail specifically requested Errol’s team because she knows the work Errol has done for kind of like Furs and the neighborhoods. And so like, your reputation kind of precedes yourself a bit.
Griffin: Yeah, like, I like the— like, my vision board for Errol is that he has a house on Carrion Street that is a, you know, cute little house, and I think he’s like, turned his front yard into a community garden where like folks come and sort of- folks of all sorts come and you know.
Travis: Improved for the people who are already living there.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: Um, great, so you head to the Mathis home. On the way you are stopped by Deputy Rosa.
Errol: Uh, hey there, Deputy Rosa. Investigation’s going great. Hundred of clues if not thousands.
Deputy Rosa: Good, good, good. Uh, I did want to talk to you real quick. Sheriff Connors sent me. I’m glad I could catch you. We felt you should know, [sighs] and listen, we’re not proud of this, but the Blackwells don’t know about this yet.
Errol: Shiit. Aw, that sucks.
Deputy Rosa: Yeah, uh. We kinda, we… and you know, maybe we’ll feel different about this in the morning but, we kinda felt best to keep them out of it until we knew what was going on. But if, uh, just— wanted to let you know that so that if you ran into them, you might have to… I mean they should be asleep now, frankly, so I don’t think it’ll come up, but, unless you decide otherwise we don’t see the need to get them involved until we know a little more about what’s going on.
Errol: Yeah, I mean, good news, bad news. Good news, lean into that instinct, it’s the right one. We don’t need that complicating matters. Bad news, if your boy didn’t come home and it was 1 a.m., I don’t think you’d be getting a lot of sleep, so.
Clint: These are vampires, right? Wouldn’t they be— they wouldn’t sleep at night, would they?
Travis: These are not vampires in the Bram Stoker kind of thing.
Griffin: Yeah sure.
Travis: These are real vampires, Dad.
Clint: Okay, okay all right.
Justin: Ah, real vampires.
Errol: Well, I’ve got to go, I’ve got a hot lead. This didn’t count as a beat.
Travis: It did not.
{35:57-42:05} [advertisements and announcements]
Travis: Um, so Errol heads over to the Mathis home. When he gets there… um, what do you do?
Griffin: I mean, I have a key, but that seems wild, right? Like, I’m not just going— if I’m doing an investigation I need to talk to people— I think breaking and entering is not the—
Travis: Well, it’s not really breaking if you have a key, but I understand what you’re saying.
Griffin: Sure. I’m gonna knock on the door. Can I like… What’s this house look like? I imagine it’s one of the bigger houses in the territory.
Travis: Well no, actually, it’s— it’s fairly regular sized. The thing about the Mathises and kind of the way about this family is, this is another thing you know from your intel, is that what they have is kind of a cluster of houses. So you’ve got uh, Abigail’s house, where Ann still lives with her, because she’s fairly young. And then next door is Dylan’s house. And then on the other side of Abigail’s house is her brother Julian’s house. And you know, they kind of spread out as they grow? So they don’t all live in a house together. It’s more kind of a-
Clint: It’s like a compound! It’s more of a compound.
Griffin: Okay. I knock on the door.
Travis: You hear kind of a snuffle-snoring kind of reaction but nothing immediately happens.
Griffin: All right. I put the key in the lock and I very slightly open the door and say,
Errol: Hey, uh, Hey this is Errol, uh, Ryehouse. I’m not—
Travis: Immediately there is a figure in the door. He is a barrel-chested, kind of scruffy-looking fella who you assume to be Liam. Um, he… he’s has sleepy eyes but he is up and ready for whatever’s happening.
Errol: Not a burglar. Not a— not— Not a burglar.
Liam: What— who are you?
Errol: Yeah, uh, my name’s Errol Ryehouse, I uh.
Liam: Errol Ryehouse?
Errol: Yeah, I uh, you know, I live just a couple houses down. Uh, just like a, like a good neighbor, Errol is here because— doing a, just sort of talking to some folks in the neighborhood, I apologize.
Liam: What do you want?
Errol: Yeah, well, what I want to do is apologize for visiting at such a late hour, I recognize that some folks like to sleep when it is 1 a.m., and for interrupting that I am truly and deeply sorry.
Liam: Who sent you here?
Errol: Uh, well, I was just talking to Abigail down at the Full Moon. She gave me the key.
Griffin: And I show the key just to prove that like I am not lying?
Errol: And, uh, suggested that I swing by and talk to— talk to—
Liam: Do you want to come in?
Errol: Yeah, if that’s all right.
Liam: Yeah, yeah… yeah, come in.
Griffin: I come in.
Travis: He opens the door and he, you know, lights a lantern or two. You can see a blanket and pillow on the couch. He was clearly sleeping there, keeping, you know, keeping watch, as it were.
Liam: What do you, what do you need?
Errol: Well, I came here to talk to Ann. Is she uh, conscious right now, is she?
Liam: You leave Ann alone.
Errol: Okay, I’m not gonna, like, attack her or anything like that, I just gotta ask her a couple questions. I’m uh, doing some work for the Graysons, trying to do my part here.
Liam: You got a badge?
Griffin: Do I have a badge?
Travis: Yes you do.
Errol: Fuck yeah, I got a—
Travis: It’s simple. It’s a circle with just “Graysons” across it.
Griffin: Okay.
Errol: Yeah, here it is, we just got ‘em put together, so this is sort of first, like, rough draft of the badge design if you know anyone with sort of a graphic mind that might— y’know, send ‘em our way.
Liam: What do you— what do you want to talk to Ann about?
Errol: Boy, this is tricky. You know anything about what happened tonight?
Liam: Wha– What?
Errol: Yeah, see, I can’t really tell you. It’s privileged information. Um. But uh, you’re Liam, right? I’m assuming.
Liam: Yeah.
Errol: All right, um. I’m doing an investigation with the Graysons. Abigail brought me on for it, and that’s all I can really say about that, but… let’s just say that deal you’re working on, with the Blackwells and the Mathises and the workers in town, it’s uh, it’s in trouble, and uh, I’m here to help sorta keep it from falling apart. So if you could just help me talk to Ann real quick, go get her up, get her a cup of, you know, instant cuppa, and maybe we’ll like like, uh, you know, wake her up a bit, I should would appreciate it, Liam.
Liam: And Abigail sent you?
Errol: Yeah. Sent me right on down.
Liam: Oh, okay. Sit— sit down and I’ll go see if Ann will talk to you.
Errol: Okay.
Travis: So Liam head upstairs. When you sit down at the table and he sets down one of the lanterns on the table with you, you see a pair of gloves on the table. They’re very large, so they’re clearly not Ann’s, so you can figure that they’re Liam’s. They’re workman’s gloves, um, and at the tips of the fingers, they’re kind of claws. Very razor sharp at the ends of the fingers. And the gloves are covered in dirt and what appears to be silver dust.
Griffin: Uh, is it— it is silver dust, then?
Travis: Yep. Liam heads upstairs.
Griffin: Is there any blood, is there any blood on the gloves?
Travis: No.
Griffin: Hm.
Travis: You hear some knocking, kind of quiet, mumbled conversation, and Liam returns with Ann in tow, and she looks, sort of to be the spitting image of her mom but younger, you know. Kind eyes, sleepy. Sleepy.
Ann: Did you— You needed to talk to me?
Errol: Yeah, sure.
Ann: Sorry, where are my manners? Hi, I’m Ann.
Errol: Hi, Ann, I’m Errol Ryehouse, I live just a couple of houses down running the community garden.
Ann: Yeah, of course.
Errol: Yeah, maybe you’ve seen our night blooming jasmine, we’re doing some good work down there. Hey, Liam, cream no sugar, though.
Travis: He just looks at you.
Errol: For the coffee.
Liam: Oh, yeah, uh, coffee.
Ann: Liam, I don’t— I don’t need coffee. Could you give us a minute please?
Liam: Yeah, uh.
Travis: And he just keeps standing there.
Errol: Yeah, don’t go too far, I do want to ask you about these weird gloves.
Liam: Oh, those are my diggers. I work in the mine.
Errol: You just punch through the wall like a fucking echidna? What’s your deal?
Liam: No, I- I can’t handle the silver ’cause I’m allergic? You know. Not bad, I mean, not so bad I can’t work, but I- I use those to, you know, take samples and dig out things I find, to find the right place to kind of focus our efforts.
Errol: Yeah
Liam: If I touched it, I’d probably, I don’t know, break out, you know, rash or whatever.
Griffin: I reach down and just like gently graze one of the claws and—
Liam: Oh, be careful—
Griffin: And there’s a slight sizzle and I’m like:
Errol: Yeah, trust me pal, I get it. Tell me, are these a common thing down there? Lots of people got these gloves?
Liam: I mean, as far as I know I’m the only Fur that works in the silver mines. I’ve— I’ve never seen anything like them.
Justin: Okay, And then Augustus bursts through the doors like:
Augustus: Aw, shit we got you! We’ve got him! Lock him up!
Clint: J’accuse!
Augustus: J’accuse! We got him!
Errol: Liam, I know this is a weird question, um, and you’ve probably got a shift in the morning so I can make sure to get ’em back to you, but you mind if I take these back to the ol’ lab?
Liam: Yeah? And I’ll get ’em back?
Errol: Oh yeah, I’ll have ’em back before sunrise, pal, don’t worry about that.
Liam: Okay.
Griffin: I gently place them in an evidence bag? No, I probably just have a, uh—
Travis: Like a messenger bag or something.
Griffin: I probably just have like a messenger bag, I tuck them in kind of—
Clint: Saddle bag! A saddle bag.
Griffin: For what? Okay, yes.
Liam: Abigail if you- if you need me I’ll go sit on the porch. I’ll be real close by. If you- if you need me, you just shout, okay?
Ann: Oh, okay. Thank you, Liam.
Travis: And he steps out of the door.
Justin: Wait, did he just say “Abigail?”
Travis: Oh, sorry. I meant— I meant Ann.
Justin: Ann. Okay.
Travis: Why did I make— I made all these names that started with J’s and A’s! I don’t know what I was thinking.
Griffin: Yeah, it’s tough.
Travis: And everybody has the same voice, and this is real tough! Anyways.
Errol: Ann, uh, tell me, you been, uh, been asleep all night? Wait, that’s a weird way to phrase that. What time did you go to bed tonight?
Ann: You’re asking about Dylan, aren’t you?
Errol: Yeah, I’m asking about Dylan. You know something?
Ann: I… Mom told me what happened.
Errol: Okay, see I had to tiptoe around Liam. It was real uncomfortable. Um, so you know about Jeremiah then too, right?
Ann: [very softly] Yeah.
Errol: I’m real sorry, I know y’all were close and I know this must be real difficult for ya what with your brother being in the slammer and your pal being dead in the street.
Ann: Dylan wouldn’t— didn’t do it. He couldn’t have.
Errol: Yeah, I mean that— that assumption is kinda why I’m here. It’s why your mama hired us so… I got a couple questions if you could help me out as much as you can. I think you’ll actually be real important in helping me crack this one.
Ann: Of course. Anything for Dylan and Jeremiah. [sniffs]
Errol: We talked to Dylan, tried to get him to be as helpful as you’re hopefully gonna be here tonight.
Travis: Her brows suddenly kind of furrow.
Ann: What did he… what did he say?
Errol: Well, he gave us a little bit. Enough I think for us to make some real progress here on the case, but seemed tight-lipped, Ann and I’ll tell you what worries me. He said that “she” wouldn’t want him to say much, and we talked to your mama and she seemed to think that the only “she” in Dylan’s life that would be able to have that sort of influence on him would be, actually, you. And so I’m wondering what all that’s about. I don’t know much about y’all’s relationship, but hopefully you can shed some light here.
Ann: That damn fool.
Travis: She kind of smiles.
Ann: He made me a promise, Mr. Ryehouse, and he’s so... dang loyal. If I tell you something, will you keep it to yourself?
Clint: [Imitating Errol] No.
Errol: Uh, yeah, I mean, as long as it’s— Yeah, I can keep a secret.
Ann: And you’ll use this to help Dylan, right?
Errol: Yeah, that’s why I’m here.
Ann: A few days ago… me and Jeremiah got married.
Errol: Well shit Ann, I’m real sorry about… everything then.
Ann: I mean, listen, when you live out here…it ain’t like death is a distant thought, you know? And frankly, if I’m being honest, I don’t even know if I’m dealing with it yet, but Dylan was there—he was the witness and he fully supported it. He wouldn’t…he wouldn’t have done it, Jeremiah was like a brother to him. I mean, almost literal. Dylan wouldn’t have done it.
Errol: I want you to know something Ann. I don’t think your brother did it, and that’s not just like werewolves watching out for werewolves stuff, that’s just the facts. I think whatever’s going on here is about — and this maybe be hard to hear, that your betrothed was just murdered for such a crass reason— but I think it’s just business. And I don’t know how plugged in you are to the big dealings that’s going on between the mines and between your family and the Blackwells and the workers in town, but that’s kind of where our investigation’s looking right now. Is there anything you can tell me about that? About the deal, about your big buddy Liam there with his murder weapon?
Ann: No, Liam’s a big old sweetie, he wouldn’t— No, he’s always been so kind to me and my family, he wouldn’t. No, you’re barking up the wrong tree there, but here’s what I know about the deal. Listen, Mr. Ryehouse, as you well know, Dry River ain’t been doing so well over the last couple of years. And I think the only thing, you know, Mr. Blackwell and Mom think is gonna help is getting incorporated. And that ain’t helping unless we have a little more order around here, so I think they’re just trying to get affairs in order so that maybe we can get a little support from, you know, the higher-ups.
Errol: Then who would wanna stop that, Ann? Is that— somebody’s not happy about this deal, and until we find out who that is, we’re just gonna be running in circles.
Ann: I don’t know… I would think everybody would wanna help the town, I don’t know why anybody would be against that.
Griffin: I’m trying to figure out where the moment is where Errol kind of— and I don’t know if this is— I don’t know if Errol even knows that they’re in this territory, but there is one person that Errol probably knows about that would be a sort of fan of chaos? And be really against incorporation—
Travis: We’re gonna get to that in a second, but first! Let’s cut back to Isabella Slate’s house. She leads you in— so, a little intel, here’s what you know about Slate. She is a Fang, but she is not from Dry River. She showed up here about two years ago, and on that night Marcus was not seen again after that, and suddenly Isabella Slate had a signed deed and contract to own the Sterling. She leads you into her home.
Isabella: Now, listen. As I’m sure you know, I’m not from here. I didn’t see anything, and I can’t give you much background, but I think I might know somebody who could answer some questions for you. If you’ll follow me.
Travis: And she leads you down into her cellar. And you find a cage, a prison cell, containing Marcus!
Griffin: The previous owner of the Sterling?
Travis: Correct!
Isabella: Marcus, wake up sweetie, there’s some people who want to talk to you.
Marcus: Hello? Who’s there?
Gandy: Um… hello Marcus. My name is Gandy.
Marcus: Gandy, he— hello.
Augustus: And I am the spectral form of Augustus Parsons, formerly the human Augustus Parsons of the Augustus Parsons Cashew Company, it’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Clint: [laughing] The late Augustus Parsons.
Marcus: Yeah… uh-huh.
Gandy: Why is… why is he caged?
Isabella: Well, Marcus is not a good person, and trust me, this is about as good as he deserved. Anyone with less of a heart would have killed him by now.
Marcus: Don’t listen to her, she— every night she comes down, feeds a little and then leaves me here in the dark. If you all would do me the kindness of, you know, just killing her and getting me out of here, sure would appreciate it.
Isabella: Yeah… I wouldn’t try that, and I wouldn’t listen to him. Now Marcus, these people have some questions about Jeremiah Blackwell and Dylan Mathis. Can you help them out?
Marcus: I don’t… I don’t see what’s in it for me.
Clint: Okay, wait, wait, hold on one second. I realize that we’re not lawmen in the Grayson agency, but this is obviously—
Griffin: It’s not great.
Clint: It’s an unlawful imprisoning. Are we just gonna blow right past that and just question this poor schmoe?
Travis: [cheerfully] That’s up to you! This is a moral quandary you’ve found yourselves in!
Augustus: Isabella, how is this useful to our investigation?
Isabella: Well, Marcus here had his, how do you say, his eye and ear on all of the seedy underbelly. Before me, he ran a fairly underbelly-type sort of establishment, and if you’re looking for any kind of rumors or dirt or any kind of knowledge that maybe you wouldn’t be able to find as agents, I think Marcus would be able to give you the scoop, as they say.
Augustus: Marcus, I have one question for you, to see if you can help and we’ll move on from there.
Marcus: Uh-huh.
Augustus: If a partnership was brewing between the Fangs and the Furs, specifically their mining interests, who would benefit from that partnership collapsing?
Marcus: I’ll make you a deal.
Augustus: Here we go.
Travis: And he looks at Gandy.
Marcus: You take my place in the feeding tonight, and I can tell you who would be against it.
Gandy: To be specific, the feeding would entail… getting bitten somewhere? And certain… certain bodily fluids being placed in another location?
Augustus: We accept. You drive a hard bargain—
Gandy: W— WAIT. WAIT. [nervous laughter] May I speak to my colleague for a moment?
Augustus: Absolutely, Gandy.
Gandy: This is— that could kill me!
Augustus: What a grand experiment, though. Think of all that you would learn from being fed on by a member of the vampyr. I am, if I may be honest, a bit jealous that I no longer have the corporeal wherewithal to take your place in this transaction.
Gandy: Gus, Gus, listen.
Augustus: It’s Augustus.
Gandy: I’m— I— yes, I know. I love the pursuit of knowledge and I’m all in favor of that, I want to learn. But I don’t want to die.
Augustus: Well, worst case scenario, well not worst case. There is a scenario in which maybe perhaps you will turn, and you will beat that old reaper carrion bad fella once and for all.
Travis: Now Justin, I do want you to know, Gus, that this I think is going to fall under “witness a scene of victimization and do nothing,” mark corruption.
Augustus: [OOC] Hell yeah, that’s closer to leveling up. That is a bonus for me, I’ve been looking for some scenes of victimization that I could witness and not do anything about. I actually counted me cheating at poker as one of those. ‘Cause I— she was victimized and I did do nothing about it, in fact quite the opposite. But Gan—
Gandy: All right. If you make me a promise.
Justin: Also I would push back against that.
[Travis laughs]
Justin: For what it’s worth, as much as I would love that big big juicy corruption point, I don’t necessarily think that Gandy submitting to this would be a victimization.
Griffin: No, he’s talking about the guy in the cell.
Justin: Oh, dunk, yeah cool. All right, I’ll witness that, I’m doing fuck all about it, I am defo getting that point for sure. Lemme just mark that, lest I forget.
Isabella: If I can jump in real quick. It would only take a second, and it’s like I’m not going to drain you, don’t be gauche.
Gandy: I don’t know who you are, I don’t know how delicious I might be—
Isabella: I haven’t killed him in two years, why would I kill you tonight?
Gandy: Maybe I’m just extra scrumptious and you won’t be able to control yourself?
Griffin: Once you pop Gandy, the feeding won’t stop.
Augustus: Ah, I— if it seems--
Gandy: I am the Pringles of blood, maybe.
Augustus: If it’s— I will make you this promise, Gandy. If it seems like our host is becoming a bit overzealous with her consumption, I will manifest and I will sort things out.
Gandy: You swear on your soul?
Augustus: What little I have left.
Gandy: All right. Bite away.
Travis: So before that happens, he— Marcus says:
Marcus: Listen, here’s what you need to know. Don’t look in the town for outsi— for people trying to stop it. You gotta look outside, there’s tons and tons of people making money off of the mines here. Specifically because it’s unincorporated, that money’s untaxed, that money is not regulated, so it’s just going to them without— You gotta look beyond. Not only that, you got groups like The Church, the Law and other groups like that that if this town were to become incorporated, they would lose a pretty big handhold in the Crescent Territory. It sounds like the deal, as you described it, is beneficial for the people making it. You gotta look bigger.
Gandy: Marcus, if I’m going to- to do this, I’m going to use my experience from when I won the Constantinople Poker Championship two years ago, I’m gonna up the ante. Me getting bitten and- and bled, I need more than that. I have one very specific question that I’m going to ask you afterwards, and I want an honest answer.
Marcus: Deal.
[Music fades in]
Gandy: I’m going to want to know who the Banshee is.
Travis: And then we cut to Errol Ryehouse walking back from the Mathis home, when he’s confronted by two… uh, I was gonna say thugs, but they’re too well-dressed for that. They smile, and it’s actually a fairly warm smile.
Gangster: Mr. Ryehouse, sorry to interrupt your stroll, do you have a minute?
Errol: Uh, time’s actually kinda of the essence there gentlemen.
Gangster: I think this is very important. It’s gonna be in your interest to say yes.
Errol: It’s been my experience that when people say that it rarely is, but uh, it sounds like y’all aren’t giving me a whole heck of a lot of choice, so uh I’m…
Gangster: No no no, please. Feel free to say no, but our employer would be very disappointed. The Banshee’s really looking forward to talking to you.

Travis: Previously on The Adventure Zone:
Travis: You see a pair of gloves on the table, they are workman’s gloves. At the tips of the fingers there are kind of… claws.
Ann: If I tell you something, will you keep it to yourself? Me and Jeremiah got married.
Marcus: It sounds like the deal is beneficial for the people making it. You’ve gotta look… bigger. I’ll make you a deal. [Augustus: Here we go.] You take my place in the feeding tonight, and I can tell you who would be against it.
Gandy: I have one very specific question I’m going to ask you. I’m going to want to know who the Banshee is.
Errol: Sounds like y’all aren’t giving me a whole heck of a lot of choice, so, uh…
Ellis: Oh, no no no, please, feel free to say no, but our employer will be very disappointed. The Banshee’s really looking forward to talking to you.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Dust Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Griffin: Should we go over clues first, or do you want to just hop right into this shit?
Justin: I think it’s very useful to do the clue recap. Dad, what clues do you have, Dad? I want to start with Dad. Give me a clue.
Clint: The first clue uh the, uh, is the uh…
Griffin: Real quick question: are all the clues going to take this long?
Clint: Silver dust! On the twin scars across the abdomen, refined silver dust, which we have to assume is coming from the silver mine.
Griffin: And the gloves, the gloves I found.
Clint: Yes, the gloves with the two blades.
Justin: I prefer order and method.
Travis: Use your little gray cells!
Justin: Use your little gray cells. The first clue: Jeremiah was confused and felt betrayed when he died. Ann didn’t want Dylan to talk. Silver dust on Jeremiah’s clothes. Ann grew up with Dylan and Jeremiah. Jeremiah’s blood was on Dylan. Jeremiah was celebrating, he was drinking a lot. He was—
Griffin: [crosstalk] He was married to Ann.
Justin: He was celebrating his marriage to Ann. I did these chronologically, so that’s kinda— you kinda gave away, yeah. Liam has claw gloves with silver dust on them.
Griffin: Uhh, yes. All good.
Justin: He was the murderer.
Griffin: Yeah, so Liam was the murderer, I kinda beefed it there. Cause I could’ve just like, werewolf attacked him. Case closed. End of arc, two episodes in, but I forgot I guess. And that’s just bad detective work, but I’ve got a lot going on right now, so… Um…
Clint: This Ann is not Anna, Augustus’s daughter, right?
Travis: No.
Griffin: No.
Justin: No.
Griffin: That would be fucking wild.
Travis: Why would that?
Griffin: Another thing, I got sort of accosted by two toughs—
Travis: Approached. I would say approached.
Griffin: Well, they were nice about it, but I was accosted by two toughs working for the Banshee, local sort of criminal ringleader in town, and Gandy got… feasted upon.
Travis: Got— got fed on. Feasted makes it sound like, “Oh let’s go crazy.""
Griffin: Travis— you wanted a fucking hard arc, bro. You wanted a fucking dark tone I’m trying to give it.
Travis: Yes, but I also want appropriate word choice.
[Someone snickers]
Griffin: Okay, that’s fine.
Travis: Words mean things, Griffin.
Griffin: And so that’s where we left off.
Travis: I’m also— I have two names for said toughs. Ellis and Blackwood, named for listeners Lucy Ellis and Ethan Blackwood.
Griffin: See? Keep on tweeting folks, keep the dream alive.
Justin: Ann— Anna’s full name is Anna Cardium Cash— sorry, not cashew that’s wild.
Clint: Cashews!
[Everyone laughs]
Justin: Anna Cardium Parsons.
Griffin: All right, where are we picking up Travy?
Travis: When last we left, we’ll say that the feeding has just completed.
Gandy: Ow.
Travis: It was minor.
Justin: Skipping the whole feeding?
Travis: It’s just like eating a sandwich, you know what I mean? This is straight to business. People always want to romanticize vampire feeding, but this is just like, “I’m hungry, I made a sandwich, gobble gobble.”
Clint: Yeah, but it’s not that much fun for the sandwich.
Travis: Well…
Griffin: Maybe.
Travis: You know, maybe? You don’t know? Maybe the sandwich is like, “Yay, my purpose!”
Justin: “I did it. I reached the culmination of all my dreams.”
Travis: “I’ve done it, I’m a sandwich.”
Justin: If you’re a sandwich and you have dreams other than getting eaten, I bet your parents are like, “Oh Jeffrey…”
Travis: “Stick to what you know.”
Justin: “What a wonderful world that would be. I would love for you to be a district attorney also.""
Clint: “We should have never given you those participation medals.”
Travis: “Oh, we encouraged you too much Jeremy the Sandwich.” And also Errol has been approached by Ellis and Blackwood. I would like to resolve that first.
Griffin: Yeah sure, are they carrying heat? Are they packing heat?
Travis: Let’s say probably? They’re not like pointing guns at you or anything. They have so far been incredibly civil. They seem reasonable.
Griffin: It’s kind of important, I feel like, for Errol in this situation to know if they’re packing heat. I don’t know if there’s a roll I can make.
Travis: Do you have like a perception roll you could do to see if maybe you like smell gunpowder?
Griffin: There’s Figure Someone Out.
Travis: Okay, yeah, go for that.
Griffin: This is embarrassing, I’ve been packing and I packed my dice up.
Travis: Oh, I thought you were gonna say like Errol’s been packing heat.
Clint: He’s packing.
Griffin: I mean, he is. That is a… six plus mind I believe? Yes. And my mind is zero. I failed.
Travis: Okay. You suspect that they are since they work for a crime boss, but you cannot pinpoint where that would be or if they are for sure.
Griffin: I say:
Errol: All right fellas, I can tell that you mean business. I’ve been meaning to have a— I mean I don’t want to sort of make myself sound like a big brave boy, I have been hiding out from the Banshee for a while now, so I’m a bit confused as to how the two of you found me. But gonna have to have a talk with my wizard companion about sort of the services she’s been providing. Look, I don’t want any trouble, and I know what the Banshee’s capable of, so I’ll come with. I wanna warn you, I have a weapon, I’m gonna take it out and just put thumb and forefinger all right? On the hilt, and I’m just gonna sort of toss it away, is that okay? Don’t—
Ellis: You can keep your weapon.
Errol: No, I know but I don’t wanna roll up to the ringleader’s house with a gun? That’s my house right there—
Ellis: You are jumpy, Errol. Is everything okay? What’s—
Errol: I’d like to—
Ellis: Errol, what’s stressing you out?
Errol: Uhh…
Clint: [laughing] “What’s going on with Errol?""
Errol: I’m just trying to— I’m not jumpy I’m just pragmatic, so I’m just gonna take my weapon here and toss it away.
Ellis: Okay…
Griffin: And I reach down and—
Travis: Uh, I should also clarify. Ellis is doing all the talking, Blackwood seems actually fairly uninterested in you and is just kind of looking up and down the street. You know, keeping an eye around.
Griffin: Sure. Oh it— good. I reach down, thumb and forefinger like I promised, and grab the hilt of my— what’s it called on a gun? Not a hilt. But like—
Clint: Grip.
Justin: A handle?
Clint: Grip.
Justin: Grip. Grip, grip grip grip grip.
Griffin: Grip, yeah, and I pull it out of my holster, and I fling it to the side of the street and into the community watch alarm bell.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: And I think when that happens, and this is not me just sort of retroactively trying to screw you over, there is a thing on my character sheet about my neighborhood, my territory, that says “People here work hard to keep the streets safe.” And so this is sort of how I’m envisioning that being realized in the world.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: And I think when the bell rings as my revolver collides with it, I think just, even though it’s a late hour, I think porch doors— or front doors open up and porch lights come on. And then there’s, you know, five or six people now probably weapons in hand, looking at this scene.
Ellis: Errol, if you didn’t want to go with us, you could have just said. I gave you the option. I don’t understand— where is this? Where— Have we offended you in some way?
Errol: Uh, offended’s not the right word. I— strong armed, might be maybe a little bit more accurate.
[Ellis gasps]
Travis: He looks offended.
Ellis: I— Oh, you know what? I can see… that we are bothering you, I apologize for that.
Travis: He offers you a business card.
Ellis: If you change your mind and you would like to speak with the Banshee, the Banshee has lots of answers. I was just looking to help. You can find us at this address, there’s instructions on the back. And we will… [laughs politely] get out of your fur. Blackwood, come along.
Travis: And they head off.
Errol: Bullshit, but cool. I guess false alarm everybody, you can go back to the house, I know that I did the big sort of meeting last week about not, you know, ringing the alarm bell for funsies. And maybe I did—
[Justin laughs]
Travis Neighbor 1: [Silly strained deep voice] Those guys seemed awful nice. They didn’t seem like they were threatening you at all.
Errol: They had a threatening aura…
Travis Neighbor 2: Really? ’Cause I— I came out here and they were just talking to you, I don’t—
Clint Neighbor 1: Are we still having the potluck dinner?
Justin: Are you as sure you’re as well-liked as you think you are here?
Young Neighbor: [High-pitched voice] Errol was there some kind of issue that we weren’t aware of? ’Cause it seemed like it was just a pleasant conversation.
Errol: No, listen, I used sort of my keen wolf senses and detected that they might probably could have possibly had guns.
Justin Neighbor 1: I think he was just trying to get out of an awkward conversation.
Travis Neighbor 2: Errol, do you not like small talk?
Justin Neighbor 1: I wish I could use the bell to bounce on talks I don’t wanna have with my mother-in-law.
Mother-in-law: [Shrilly gruff?] What’d you say?!
Justin Neighbor 1: Apparently we’re all just ringing the bell higgledy-piggledy when we don’t wanna talk to somebody. When someone asks us to go to a movie we’ve already seen, apparently we’re just throwing guns at bells.
Travis Neighbor 3: Oh, was that it Errol? Were they asking you if you would, like, house sit for ’em or something and you didn’t want to?
Clint Neighbor 1 (Clementius): You know, Errol, it is kind of funny if you think about it. You are now being accused as the boy that cried wolf.
[Chorus of werewolf neighbor laughs]
Justin Neighbor 2: Oh Clementius, another great joke from you—
Clementius: Thank you, thank you.
Justin Neighbor 2: You still doing stand-up at the Knuckle Hut?
Clementius: I been—
Errol: All right, all right—
Clementius: It’s open mic night down at the saloon.
Justin Neighbor 2: We gotta go there.
Errol: This is great, uh, listen— Dad’s busy, so I gotta get back to work, I’m sorry for ringing the old bell.
Griffin: I go pick up my revolver, kind of sheepishly.
Errol: And yeah, potluck is on for Thursday, remember, somebody’s gonna need to bring some sort of gluten-free offering for Derek, so…
{11:32}
Young neighbor: Is ambrosia gluten free?
Errol: Uh, maybe. So we’ll— just do your research on that and go back to bed.
Justin Neighbor 3 (Derek): Hey it’s uh, me, Derek. Listen, I— if people forget to bring me gluten-free options is that like a bell-ringing-worthy situation? [crosstalk] Should I go ahead and ring the alarm bell?
Errol: [crosstalk] No, don’t ring the bell for that Derek—
Derek: If there’s no gluten-free options?
Errol: Yeah, I’ve set a real bad example here. All right, go back to bed, bye.
Griffin: And I holster my weapon—
Derek: I’m actually up for the night, mate, you wanna do something? Let’s do our own thing. Come with you, right?
Griffin: I would love to regroup real quick, just so I can— I have the, what I believe, what Errol believes I should say, is the murder weapon. I would love to get that to my companions. I know we talked about how that process was kind of automatic, the info-sharing process, but I think it’s weird that there wasn’t any blood on it and so I’m wondering if there’s something that—
Travis: That’s great, ’cause I conto— concocted in my mind this whole system of like psychic paper—
Griffin: …No.
Travis: Where you can write down notes and they would get it on their notepad, but this is way better. You guys go talk to each other, let’s say.
Griffin: I don’t want to strong arm Gandy into like spending a beat investigating these gloves or whatever, but like these are razor-sharp gloves with silver dust on them. It feels pretty, I don’t know, it would be good at least to rule out Liam.
Travis: You are a werewolf with certain senses, I mean, blood—
Griffin: That is true, I guess I could just—
Travis: —is probably something you could detect.
Griffin: Yeah, but you told me that I didn’t detect any blood on it though, is that just by looking at it?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: If I went a little bit deeper. Mmkay. I guess I could roll Bloodhound on it.
Travis: I mean, even if you just wanted to go like, basic level investigate and check it out and look at it and just straight-up roll if you don’t want to do a corruption point. I mean you could— you’re not inept, you could do just kind of basic investigation.
Griffin: Bloodhound doesn’t give me a corruption.
Travis: Oh, excellent.
Griffin: I’ll just go ahead and do that, ’cause I don’t think that would take an hour.
Clint: Well Gandy has Tracking. She has a spell called Tracking.
Griffin: Yeah, that would be good if I think we need to figure out— Let me Bloodhound it and see if there’s actually blood on it.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: ’Cause if there’s not, like, that would be wild. So I’ll roll Bloodhound. That is a… six? And a four, that’s a 10, plus blood is a 12.
Travis: Great, so here’s what you can tell from it. There is no blood on it, but it was recently cleaned and oiled. And you know it’s been thoroughly scrubbed, and it’s fairly recent. Now whether that is because it had blood on it or because you know, Liam just takes care of his tools is unclear, but it does seem like it has been scrubbed clean in the recent past.
Griffin: All right, I— what this power says is I pick up a scent from whatever I do, and I can follow that scent to the person who has them. And I’m assuming I’m just kind of doing this in the street after putting Carrion Street back to bed, all embarrassed-like. Is this sit—
Travis: And just so you know, Derek is still watching you sniff some gloves.
Griffin: Great, great.
Travis: So just like know that.
Griffin: No, I’m being— yeah. I’m very aware of that. Is that scent— are those stink lines just leading me right back to Liam on the porch of the—
Travis: Yes. I mean, these are Liam’s gloves. You have no reason, especially since the stink lines, you have no reason to think that anyone else has interacted with these.
Griffin: All right. Let’s— I think let’s regroup now.
{15:21}
Travis: Okay, so Errol heads to the town square. Now Gandy and Gus, you do not know of Errol’s regrouping plan, so I’ll turn to you. The feeding has completed, it was brief. And what you found Gandy, is as it happened — and whether this was something on your end on or something that happened during the feeding — it kind of just blanked out that time period as it happened. You try to recall the feeding, and it just fuzzes out whenever you get close to it in your memories. Now Gus, you were there to witness, you kept an eye, you made sure it didn’t get out of hand, but it was brief. It just seemed like Slate took just enough to feed and move on.
Griffin: Are they still there?
Travis: Yeah, so that’s wrapping up and they got the first information about who would be interested, and the question was asked “Who is the Banshee?” And now! [dramatic gasp] I shall answer that question from Marcus.
Gandy: We had an arrangement, we had a deal.
Marcus: Yeah, so here’s what I know about the Banshee. The Banshee is, well, I— listen. If I had met the Banshee, I wouldn’t tell you the Banshee’s true identity, but here’s what I can tell you. The Banshee has thrived in this unincorporated territory. Business has been good for the Banshee. And I don’t— I can’t imagine the Banshee would want that to change. Now that said… times are changing, and that affects everyone, so it’s quite possible that this has been… the work of the Banshee, but it sure don’t seem like it. Seems awful sloppy and awful loud for someone like the Banshee to have done.
Gandy: Oh great, I gave up what, three pints for that?
Travis: What, you want me to just be like, “Oh yeah, it was Steve. Steve did it! Go get him.” Like Marcus is in a cage downstairs, he doesn’t know shit about shit!
Gandy: Okay…
Travis: What did you want to know?
Clint: I wanted to know if it was Steve!
Travis: It wa— Listen, I can tell you right now: It was Steve.
Griffin: Let’s get him!
Clint: Aha!
Travis: Go get Steve. But you’ll never find— Steve is a ghost!
Griffin: I ring the bell again.
Errol: It was Steve!
Travis: Steve is Keyser Söze. So what are you two gonna do now? If you want to just say like as you’re heading out of Slate’s home, you see Errol in the street. Save a little bit of trying to figure out why you would go looking for Errol, but I don’t know, unless you guys want to do that.
Griffin: Yeah, let’s have 10 minutes where we just wander down the streets of Dry River just like:
Errol: Gandy?
Gandy: Augustus! Oh, no I know… Augustus do you have any cashews? I’m feeling really drained.
Travis: He’s a ghost!
Augustus: Well, no, I have ghost cashews. I actually don’t know what would happen if you attempted to eat them. I will make them manifest, though.
Gandy: I will— I’ll take the chance, I’m starved.
Augustus: All right. Here’s a— here you go. Ooh, one packet of the finest spectral cashews this side of the Mississippi—
Gandy: Ooh, ah! Salt and pepper, oh I love these.
Augustus: Yes, it’s a new flavor what you’re—
Travis: I’m gonna say that you are having an intimacy moment right now.
[Griffin laughs]
Travis: So I would like you both to do what that— what happens when you have an intimacy moment.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: So for the Spectre, when you share a moment of intimacy, physical or emotional, with another person, you hold one. Whenever they get into trouble, you can spend your hold to be there.
Justin: Cool.
Clint: With the Wizard, when you share a moment of intimacy, physical or emotional, with another person, decide whether you care about them or not. If you don’t, they go about their business as normal. If you do, they take negative one ongoing to escape until they get some intimacy somewhere else.
Travis: So do you care about Gus?
Griffin: This is a big decision to be made after the ghost cashews thing.
Travis: Hey listen, you can’t introduce the idea of ghost cashews and just like, and I, the GM, am like, “Meh, I don’t care about ghost cashews.” Of course I care about ghost cashews! We’re making a moment here. And you know I think that that happens whenever someone has a delicious Parsons cashew. A moment is made.
Griffin: Of ghostly cashews that were murdered in a terrible passion.
Gandy: Augustus, you—
Augustus: Yes?
Gandy: You didn’t have to keep an eye on me during the feeding, and I really appreciate the fact that you— you were there just in case something had gone wrong. And mostly because you knew how afraid I was of death and also because I think you got a little bit of a kick out of it. But you know what?
Augustus: It was both, you’re correct.
Gandy: Augustus Parsons—
Augustus: Fire and ice. That’s Augustus Parsons.
Gandy: I care about you.
Augustus: Well thank you.
Gandy: I care about you.
Augustus: I suddenly feel like my ability to escape has become diminished somehow.
Gandy: That’s love. That— that is—
Augustus: Indeed.
Gandy: That is love in all of its forms and definitions.
Augustus: And you Gandy, you have my marker. If ever you should need me, I can assure you I will be there.
Gandy: Well the cashews go a long way towards taking care of that. But I just want you to know I—
Augustus: Do you want to see something really cool? The really neat part?
Justin: And he digs in his pocket.
Gandy: Yes! Yes.
Augustus: More! See there are more, I just—
Gandy: Oh!
Augustus: They’re spectral cashews, so you will not receive any nutrition from them, but it is a repeatable trick of mine.
Gandy: Amazing!
Griffin: So let’s go over clues.
Travis: We did that already, so if we want to do like the propeller spin. And that’s where we’re at—
[Clint makes cartoony spin transition noise]
Justin: What was— can we actually go over the earlier clues? My clues were just from the last episode. So if we have any, like, earlier stuff that we think might be germane.
Griffin: I think we got everything actually.
Travis: Yeah, the silver dust and Dylan’s thing, “she” wouldn’t want him to talk. That’s— well I have actually also been keeping track of what I know versus what you find out.
Justin: Would it be worth, like, should we try to… Let me ask you this, Travis, are we at a point now where we can have a conversation and try to piece together…?
Travis: Absolutely.
Justin: Okay. I think—
Travis: I think that would make for good radio.
Griffin: Let’s have that scene. Yeah. Okay so let’s regroup now that everybody’s all cashewed up.
Clint: Mm!
Travis: Is that how Errol sounds?
Griffin: Uh, no that’s how Griffin sounds.
Travis: Okay.
Justin: So who’s cashew— so Griffin McElroy, Griffin Andrew McElroy, Andy to his friends, is saying to me, Justin, that I’m cashewed up.
Clint: Tyler to his friends.
Justin: Yes. Ty-ty Baby.
Griffin: Um… yeah. So I imagine we’re like around the Black Maria at this point, sort of in the town square.
Augustus: So who— After reviewing all this information, who are our possible suspects? I think Liam is an obvious choice.
Errol: Uh, yeah I mean these are Liam’s gloves, and I don’t know, they seem to fit the ah— seem to fit the murder weapon description as we know it, with the razor-sharp claws and the dust from the local silver mine. Seems likely. I haven’t really pressed— put the irons to Liam yet for finding out whether or not he done it, but might be worth circling back there. Ann swears up and down that he’s a good dude, but I don’t know. She might be a little too close to make a judgement call.
Augustus: Good dudes do terrible things all the time.
Errol: That’s fair.
Gandy: I think we need to figure out motive. It seems like every time we start to establish a motive, it gets turned around. I mean, we had this idea about the deal coming together, and how everybody will benefit from it. But we have yet to find somebody who wouldn’t benefit from it. I— I think motive is very important. We need to figure out what the motive would be for someone to kill him.
Augustus: Obviously there’s unrest. And keeping those mines separate is a huge one. There could also be jealousy of this new betrothal. I’m not sure who that would necessarily point the finger towards, I don’t have a good suggestion there.
Gandy: Could it be that— so that would be concern of the heart, right?
Augustus: Perhaps, yes.
Errol: Here’s what I’m stumped about. I think we can rule out the fact that Dylan just killed Jeremiah because he didn’t like him. I think what we know now, Dylan probably didn’t do it. At least not for the reasons that we assumed at first glance. Problem is, if this was a business thing, someone needed to know where Dylan was gonna be and where Jeremiah would be in order to stage this thing the way they wanted it to.
Augustus: Indeed.
Errol: I don’t see how this was done by anybody but somebody who was familiar with them. Somebody who would know how to set this framing up the way that it turned out. So… that’s what I’m torn between. I think the business problem is probably— the business thing is probably the most likely answer for this, but it would need to be somebody who also knew the two of them pretty well.
Gandy: And speaking of business, our job here is to… find out and then to prove that Dylan didn’t do it. The only way we’re gonna do that is to find out who did it. We have no evidence to submit at all to get Dylan off the hook. And that’s what we were hired to do.
Errol: Yeah, we ain’t close. I think at this point, two things probably worth doing. I think it’s probably worth talking to the Banshee, and speaking of…
Griffin: And I unclasp a pendant that I have around my neck and hand it to Gandy, and I say:
Errol: This didn’t work, uh, didn’t really keep me hid from the Banshee in the way that you said it would, so that is as you might imagine, pretty disappointing to me. But um…
Gandy: Well, if— if you remember the warranty… You know, it’s— it wasn’t a hundred percent.
Travis: And if I may, Griffin, so that it doesn’t seem like Gandy is a shitty wizard, just because you couldn’t be located magically doesn’t mean that there isn’t other, like— that’s a thing that people often take for granted in this world with magic and wizards and location spells [Griffin: That’s fair.] and everything is like, private eyes can just find you.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s fair. I still give it back to her and say like:
Errol: So uh, I think we’re probably square on that sort of— that sort of facet of our arrangement.
Gandy: I’m sorry it didn’t help…
Errol: Aw it’s fine, it’s fine, it’s not your fault.
Gandy: I’ll give it to Uncle Oni, he can run through the specs and see— What about this glove thing? Would it be worth our time to have Uncle Oni take a look at it? I still have a couple of more questions I can ask him.
Errol: I mean, I snorted up its stink pretty good, and there’s nothing on it. No blood or nothing. It’s been cleaned, but the only traces I’m picking up on it is Liam. I don’t know if your magic doll can figure out if it was used for a murder recently, but I think—
Augustus: I don’t know how they could clean the blood and not the silver dust.
Errol: Yeah, it’s a bit confusing, but let’s not dive too deep into that. It might upset the apple cart. I think it’s worth talking to the Banshee, and now that we do know Jeremiah and Ann were hitched, probably worth going to talk to Dylan again, don’t you think?
Augustus: Yes, I think that that might be worth pursuing.
Errol: Y’all want to split up?
Augustus: I suppose.
[Gandy sighs]
Errol: I mean, I miss y’all, I feel like we haven’t had our “us” time.
Gandy: I’m not in favor of splitting up.
Errol: All right. Yeah— here’s the thing. I certainly don’t want to go up against the Banshee without our full sort of capabilities as a [Gandy: Of course.] crime fighting unit, as it were. So why don’t we go talk to Dylan, let him know what we know, and then head on up to Banshee HQ. I got a business card here, I guess it’s got an address on it.
Travis: Just to clarify, when you— the instructions on the back of the card do explicitly say to come alone.
Griffin: Yeah fuck off, no way. [Theme music fades in] I mean, cool, thank you business card, but eat my shorts.
Errol: Let’s go talk to old Dylan first and see what we can get out of him and then go figure out a plan to take on the Banshee.
{28:20-33:26} AD BREAK
Travis: So you head into the sheriff’s office. Connors is there, of course, at his desk. He’s got his feet up on the desk but still very much awake, just kind of keeping an eye on everything. Do you want to check in with him or just head on over to Dylan?
Justin: I feel like it might be worth— If we have time, like, is it worth seeing if he’s discovered anything? Because they were working on it too, weren’t they?
Griffin: Yeah, we catch the sheriff up on everything we’ve learned so far. [Travis: Yeah, yeah, yeah] Do we want to tell him about the marriage? I don’t see any reason to keep that a secret.
Clint: I think the more that we can use him, with his prescient powers to know if people are lying or not—
Justin: To what extent did they— I mean, he’s dead, right? I mean, what does it— I think it’s okay to— How much did he— did she want you to keep it a secret?
Griffin: Uh, she didn’t seem eager to tell me, but she didn’t tell me explicitly not to tell anybody. I think it’ll— [Justin: I think it’s fine] Oh no, she DID. She said to keep it a secret. Oh, well.
Justin: She said to keep it a secret? Okay, then don’t mention it. I mean, it’s your information to do with what you want. I wouldn’t, but it’s up to you.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, Okay, alright, then we don’t tell him about that part. We tell him about everything else.
Connors: Well, you know it— I didn’t think— If I’m being honest, I didn’t think it was Dylan. Didn’t seem like him, didn’t seem like he’d do it. You got any leads on who you think might’ve done it?
Errol: Well, we’re gonna go talk to the Banshee, and that’s gonna go probably about as well as you’d expect.
Connors: Jesus.
Errol: Yeah, no, yeah, this one got a little buckwild.
Connors: The Banshee’s here?
Errol: Uhh, apparently, yep.
Connors: I don’t know if I’d do that, but it’s your job, you do what you want. We ain’t been able to uncover much more than you. We talked with Silver, he said that, you know, he couldn’t be sure, but when he walked up, Dylan didn’t— You know, he saw Dylan from a distance and couldn’t tell if he had any blood on him or not. That just goes to support the theory that it weren’t Dylan. And then, you know, he saw Dylan over the body, kinda pick it up. And as he got closer, Dylan definitely had blood on him at that point. Once again, can’t be sure, he’d been drinking. And so it’s not a super reliable witness, but it do— It goes into the column of support for “Dylan didn’t do it”, so that’s good. But unless— here’s the thing: people in town here, if we don’t have somebody to give ‘em that did do it, the word of Silver ain’t gonna cover it, you know what I mean? It’s a good— I don’t mean to knock it, it’s a good start, you’re doing good work. If there’s anything I can do to help you, let me know.
Errol: Thanks, Dad. Yeah, we’re gonna keep pounding the pavement on this. You know, I feel like it’s close. Ohh, do I feel like it’s real close.
Augustus: It’s right there on the tip. Okay, who are possible suspects? Who do we have? Who do we know? Liam.
Gandy: Liam.
Augustus: Any other names? Any— okay, let’s rule out by class. Any Fangs?
Errol: I mean…
Augustus: That might be able to benefit?
Connors: The only Fang would be Nox right? He’s the Blackwell’s kind of second, but he’s the most loyal— I don’t even think it’s worth looking into. But he’s the only, like, other powerful respected Fang, but not— trust me. Wouldn’t hurt Jere— he’s Jeremiah’s godfather. Wouldn’t have—
Errol: Sheriff I got a— Yeah, I gotta tell you, pretty much everybody in this town has somebody who’s gonna vouch for ’em and talk about what a righteous dude they are, so—
Augustus: Right.
Errol: We can’t really take that into account. ’Cause somebody in this town is not a righteous person, so—
Augustus: I’m sorry, I’m taking out my spectral notebook, and I’m putting a little star next to Tommy Nox. And I’m sorry, do not take this personally against your word, sir…
Connors: Listen, fine. We just got limited time here, but it’s up to you.
Augustus: Alright, first—
Griffin: What time is it?
Travis: I think at this point you’re in like the 3 to 5 [a.m.] period.
Augustus: First…
Connors: Well you got— we can’t… can’t take Dylan off the table.
Errol: Yeah, I mean…
Gandy: We can take Johnny Mathis off the list, ’cause he’s deceased.
Augustus: Indeed, he’s deceased. Any other Furs that might have something to gain here?
Travis: And just to clarify, ’cause that was our first mission, Johnny Mathis was Abigail’s husband previously. I don’t think we had said it out loud on the show yet. I’ll let everyone know at home: we’ve already met Jonathan… the ghost!
Clint: [Imitating dramatic music] Bum bum bumm!
Griffin: Really?
Travis: Yeah. That was the ghost that—
Griffin: That was who that—?
Travis: Yup.
Griffin: He seemed awfully cavalier about his son being framed for murder.
Travis: He didn’t know anything about it, remember? He said he didn’t know— all he knew was that the spirit had come through and had felt surprised and hurt.
Griffin: Interesting, okay. I completely missed that.
Errol: All right, we could sit here and list names for, you know, until the sun comes up, and then we have failed, so let’s just get back to it.
Gandy: We do have an eyewitness that we really haven’t gotten anything out of? Dylan?
Augustus: Yes, I believe it’s time to question young Mathis again.
Travis: Okay, so you head over to the cell where he is still faced away from the cell. What do you do?
Griffin: First off, I say:
Errol: Sheriff, I know this is a bit strange, but would you mind giving us some privacy? I don’t think he’s gonna wanna talk if you’re looming over him.
Connors: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it. I’ll be out on the porch, you just come get me when you’re done. And don’t— Don’t do anything I’d have to come and shoot you for or arrest you for or nothing like that, okay? I don’t want you trying to break him out or any of that shit.
Errol: No, like— Yeah. For sure.
Gandy: [laughs uncomfortably] Yeah, we never even, [whispers] damn it.
Travis: He leaves.
Gandy: Dylan, we know about—
Dylan: Leave me alone.
Gandy: Ann told us about the wedding.
Dylan: Tell me what she told you.
Errol: That she married Jeremiah in secret. That you were there and the three of you have been friends since you were just pups, so—
Gandy: Said you were best wolf at the wedding.
Dylan: I... Yeah.
Errol: I can understand why you’d want to keep that a secret. I can appreciate you not wanting to talk to us earlier. But you gotta… I’m starting to see slivers of sunrise outside. You have not much time on this earth, my friend. And you gotta tell us something, you gotta give us something, Dylan. You were there. And we don’t think you did it, I swear to god. We just want need to know who did if we’re gonna save your skin.
Dylan: I loved... Jeremiah Blackwell. And… he loved Ann. And when they got married… Do you… Mr. Ryehouse, do you know— Have you ever, in a moment, been the most happy and saddest you’ve ever been in your whole life?
Errol: No, Dylan, I can’t say I’ve had something as horrible as that happen to me. I’m sorry that you did.
Dylan: I… I was— I was at the bar drinking, and Jeremiah had said he wanted to celebrate, and I told him I couldn’t. I just needed to be by myself for a while. And if I’d been with him… Maybe I could’ve saved him. Maybe… It’s… I could’ve saved him, and he’d still be alive, and I deserve to be in here, Mr. Ryehouse.
Errol: Aw, bud, listen: Whoever wanted to kill Jeremiah Blackwell was gonna find a way to do it, no matter what. I know that’s tough to hear, but there’s folks in this town who are exceptionally good at doing the kind of stuff what happened to Jeremiah. So you can’t take that one on the chin. You were with him at the bar? They kill both of you.
Dylan: Then I’d be dead too and I wouldn’t have to feel like this anymore, Mr. Ryehouse. It’s hard. This is the worst—
Augustus: Do you know what makes us laugh? There isn’t a lot; once you come over to my side, we don’t have a lot of jocularity over here. Probably won’t come as much of a surprise. The thing that we find funny over here— one of the things, we have some prop comedy and what have you— one of the main things that we find funny over here is when human beings on the mortal coil believe they have the time to punish themselves for things that are not their fault. And you don’t. Trust me, I’ve been over here a while and I’ve seen enough of the mortal world and the spectral world to know that your time is fleeting. Your time, in fact, may be more fleeting than most. You do not have the moments to continue to flagellate yourself for this crime that you are not the perpetrator of. Now, what is the antidote to despair? Well, my friend, it is action. And that is what we are trying to take on your behalf. And the behalf of those you care about. So. We’ll ask you one last time, Dylan: who killed Jeremiah Blackwell?
Griffin: That was fucking great.
Clint: That was.
Dylan: If he knew about the marriage, Liam— He loved my sister, and he hated Jeremiah.
Errol: We can go talk to Liam. We can sniff him out. I gotta ask; you think this was because of the marriage? Because this whole time, we’ve been assuming it has something to do with the business arrangement that your folks and the Blackwells folks are trying to whip up.
Dylan: I don’t know. It’s hard for me to think of it as being about anything but the marriage, you know what I mean? I guess it could be about the business, but I don’t know who would have issue with that—
Augustus: Would Liam benefit— Would Liam stand to benefit from a fusion of the Fangs and the Furs and their mining interests?
Dylan: Of course, he’s the head of the workers. He’s been negotiating on behalf of them, and because he’s both a worker and one of us, he’s kind of had an in there that’s made it a little bit easier to work with and… Yeah, I mean, I don’t see why he’d be against, you know, better conditions for the workers and better pay. Everything that’s been negotiated—
Gandy: So Dylan, does this— Dylan, help me figure out the timetable. So you didn’t see it happen, but you found him, you saw him in this terrible condition, correct?
Dylan: I… I found him bleeding out… And I held him as he died.
Errol: [quietly] Jesus.
Augustus: All right, I think we have everything that we’re going to be able to withdraw here from this scenario Mr. uh, Mathis. Thank you for sharing that with us.
Errol: Yeah, we’re gonna go… we’re gonna go finish putting this thing together, but [nervous laughing] I just decided while we were talking to you that no matter what happens, you ain’t gonna die tomorrow. So I don’t know what that means yet, I guess we’ll have to figure it out when the sun comes up, but you get some rest.
Augustus: Let’s just hope there’s a bell nearby wherever the—
Errol: Oh, come on.
Augustus: —the hanging is going to happen, and then you’ll be able to—
Gandy: And it’s gotta be within arm’s reach of him have him throwing the gun.
Augustus: Within fling’s reach.
Gandy: Yeah, fling’s reach.
Errol: It’s an inside joke, Dylan, we will catch you up tomorrow—
Gandy: Not really, that inside, that inside, really, Dylan if you were down on Carrion Str—
Errol: When you are a free man. Okay, let’s gooo.
Travis: Okay, so what’s the plan re: the Banshee?
Justin: The Banshee, right?
Griffin: Yeah, I think that going to the Banshee is the next thing, right? Because after we go to the Banshee, I feel like we’re gonna know, if not everything, enough to know who to go for.
Travis: Cool.
Griffin: And so we can go talk to Liam now, but like, why not go rule out this other thing first, and then we can make a call?
Justin: I’m gonna be seen and heard, but not felt. I was going to do the invis thing, but with a name like “the Banshee,” I’m pretty sure he’s gonna be able to know sort of my whole thing. Sort of, you know, my… bag o’ tricks.
Griffin: You’re… what you do. Um, I mean, he told me to come solo, so I think the best thing is for me to appear to come solo and have the two of them in sort of… ready to launch a fucking rescue mission, as will probably be required. Gandy, I don’t know what you are capable of in that department. I don’t know if you have, like, stealth capabilities.
Clint: I have a— she has a spell called Veil where you can spend one hold to make yourself invisible from sight, but it’s just for a few moments, so I don’t know if that’s gonna be so great—
Travis: I mean, that could give you the advantage if you want to come in and kind of scope out before revealing thyself.
Clint: Well, like everything else, it’s tied to one of her artifacts, so, I would love to try to do that [Travis: Yes!] and work undercover.
Griffin: Yeah, let’s do that. Um—
Travis: Okay, so, as you head out the door towards— you pass Connors on the porch.
Connors: Hey, were you able to get much out of him? Did he say more to you than he would say to me?
Errol: Uh, we got— Yeah, we got a lot. Listen, you’re not gonna hang him in the morning. I know you’ve got responsibilities and stuff but—
Connors: It ain’t me! How many times do I have to tell you?
Errol: No no no no, I’m not saying— I ain’t putting the blame on you, I know you’ve got a job to do and I know this town’s got needs. I’m just saying… that it can’t happen. So.
Connors: I’ll keep him safe.
Gandy: Sheriff, we’re— we are not of the law like you are. We’re just kind of hired guns, we come in and we do our job, but you are responsible for justice. And if that young man dies, that’s not justice at all. So keep him safe.
Connors: I will.
Griffin: And we head to the Banshee!
Travis: So you approach a house, I assume you follow the instructions, the— it’s in what appears to be an abandoned home, all boarded up, the roof is caved in. And the instructions lead you around the back of the home to the storm cellar door.
Griffin: Fuck.
Travis: The lock is rusted, but when you try the door you find that the actual arm that the lock is on isn’t attached to the door, it opens cleanly. And as you head down you find a well-lit kind of foyer? Where Ellis and Blackwood are waiting for you, and I assume, tell me the prep.
Clint: Well, I sh— I need to. I’ve got to channel to do the spell, so that is a nine plus two for mind, that’s 11.
Travis: You’re totes veilèd.
Griffin: What’s that give you?
Clint: Okay, all right, all right, Veil. “Spend one hold to make yourself invisible from sight for a few moments.”
Travis: Okay, you’ve done that.
Clint: And so when I channel, if I roll 10-plus, I get three holds.
Justin: There we go.
Travis: Okay.
Clint: Okay. All right.
Travis: So you are veiled.
Griffin: Yeah, so you could just keep veiling yourself.
Clint: Okay. And is Augustus, are you invisible?
Justin: Uh, you know I wasn’t gonna be, but if you’re gonna be it seems weird for me to not be.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: I fucking love that scene of the two of you just like poof! “What’s up?”
Justin: Alright, yeah.
Griffin: I make as much noise coming down the stairs as I possibly can to hide the fact that my two companions who definitely can still be heard creaking the floorboards are coming down also. So I’m coming down like:
Errol: Hey it’s me Errol! I'm coming down, don’t shoot okay? I’m just coming down the stairs right now, this is a pretty nice little setup you got here, and I’m excited—
Griffin: And I reach the bottom of the staircase and everybody else does too—
Ellis: Mr. Ryehouse!
Errol: Looks great. Yep.
Ellis: I’m so glad you decided to come. Also, before I lead you in to meet the Banshee, I just want to say no hard feelings. I forgive you for not trusting me. It’s something that I have been working on, I’ve been talking with Blackwood about it. I was very upset at first, but I know how we can come across. And I just want to say—
Travis: And Blackwood kind of lays a hand on Ellis’s shoulder.
Ellis: Thank you. I forgive you. I forgive you.
Errol: Yeah, thanks, I was really concerned… about that. So uh… yep, I’m just— I’m here to talk to the Banshee, and—
Ellis: Of course, of course. Right this way.
Travis: And he pulls back a curtain, and you enter a room. And there is a well-polished table, richly decorated room. It smells nice, you know, a little floral but not sickly sweet. Just enough that you can tell someone took the care, you know, to kind of spruce up the place a little bit. And sitting at the table is a little old woman, about 65 I would say? And she gestures for you to sit at the opposite end of the table.
Griffin: Uh… I do? Ensuring that I make a lot of noise as I like scoot the chair back— I’m very concerned that somebody’s gonna hear my friends, so it’s just like [slow chair scooting noise] as I scoot it back, and I sit down and uh—
Banshee: Mr. Ryehouse. Ho! I am so glad to finally meet you.
Errol: Yeah, I bet. So uh, yeah, nice to meet you too, uh Banshee?
Banshee: Yeah. That— I mean, listen. I’m excited to meet— I’m not going to give you my name. Listen, at this point I identify as Banshee more than my birth name anyway, so it’s— this is fine. Would you prefer Errol or Mr. Ryehouse or what should I call you?
Errol: I mean, you can call me Dave if you can help me figure out— on the case I’m working on right now.
Banshee: [Laughs] Dave! That is funny! Fun-ny.
Errol: Hey, you like that one.
Griffin: Before we go any further, can I actually roll Face to a Name to see?
Travis: Absolutely.
Griffin: That is a one, uh-oh! And a six. So that’s a seven, and I add my— what faction are they?
Travis: Uh, well.
Clint: Spectre, right?
Griffin: Well, we don’t know that. Doesn’t seem like it.
Travis: They are Night.
Griffin: Night. Okay. Uhh… okay. So that is a… that’s not good.
Travis: You rolled a one and a six, so that would be a seven.
Griffin: Yeah, so it’s a seven, plus one is an eight.
Travis: Okay, so here’s what you know about the Banshee.
Griffin: Daria Cross was the wizard who tried to transform me, and she was a part of the Banshee’s like, team, or whatever and was kind of excommunicated after doing this spell to try to, uh, try to revert me back to a human— permanent human state. And because of that, I have been hiding Daria in Carrion Street [Travis: Yes.] and that is why— that is what I remember to be sort of our main point of contention.
Travis: Now, here’s—
Griffin: But I don’t know anything about, like, their operation here.
Travis: Right, so the Banshee is kind of a fingers-in-a-lot-of-pies criminal boss. And I will say that the reason — to flesh out the backstory between you and the Banshee with what you’ve just given me — I will say that maybe the Banshee was trying to leverage the fact that they knew you were a werewolf and wanted to be a politician, to maybe try to get you in their pocket a little bit. And that’s why [Griffin: Love that.] when this spell happened to cure you of that and kind of rob them—
Griffin: Oh, that's good, Travis!
Travis: Hey, thank you very much.
Griffin: So it’s not a like, they were upset that one of their team members did a job outside of the purview of the Banshee, but rather that because of what Daria did, they lost a foothold. That’s fucking great, yeah.
Travis: Hey, thank you very much! And so the thing about the Banshee is nobody knows much about them. And everybody knows of the Banshee, everybody knows the kind of crime ex— you know, network and web, but as far as personal information goes, nobody seems to know anything about the Banshee as an individual. But yeah, other than that you don't know much about the Banshee.
Griffin: No, but I imagine that like, criminal ringleader complicating things in town, not my fucking favorite person here. Like, I wanna explain because they have been so congenial towards me, but like, I fucking know what they do here. I know what they— I know what their stuff is.
Banshee: Well, Mr. Ryehouse, I know that you are a busy man, and I don’t want to keep your time— Is it safe to assume that Augustus is somewhere nearby, maybe in the room if we’re being honest?
Errol: … No. You told me to come alone—
Banshee: Errolll…
Errol: What?
Banshee: Errollll.
Errol: I’m not— I ain’t lying.
Griffin: I am lying. I’d like to roll to deceive. There’s a move called Mislead, Distract, or Trick.
Clint: And your rolls have been shitty lately, too.
Griffin: Yeah… That is a five and a two, another seven. I have zero mind. “On a seven to nine, pick two. You create an opportunity, you expose a weakness or flaw, you confuse them for some time, or you avoid further engagement.” Um… I want to say maybe create an opportunity and confuse them for some time maybe?
Travis: Okay. What opportunity would you like to create?
Griffin: Is the opportunity for my friends to remain concealed on the table?
Travis: Sure, yeah, we’ll go with that for some time.
Errol: Yeah, I uh, listen, we’re in the middle of kind of a big job right now, and we’re kind of—
Banshee: Oh, I know! Yes! I know.
Errol: So we’re trying to split up, cover more ground… you probably know.
Banshee: Yes, makes sense.
Errol: You probably know what it’s like on the other side. We’re trying to do is solve this crime, so— I think they’re over at Silver’s place right now? So I’m here to talk to you alone, I figure whatever you got I can probably handle.
Banshee: Okay. Well, listen. Let’s get down to business. I want to help you in this. I want to help you solve this. I want the deal between the Furs and the Fangs and the workers, I want it to go through.
Errol: Now… okay. Is this like a “big fish in a small pond looking for the pond to get bigger” kind of thing?
Banshee: No, well… that might be part of it, but here’s the thing. I welcome structure, Mr. Ryehouse. Chaos thrives against structure. Do you understand? If everything is chaos, no one seeks me out, no one needs vice if everything’s chaos, they seek structure. That’s why in times of upset and fraught tension, that’s why people turn to The Church and turn to leadership and seek out structure. But when everything is rigid, that’s when people seek out vice. That’s when my business thrives! I want this to go— I want the territory to be incorporated, then I‘ll have more opportunity for vice. Do you understand?
Errol: I know the way of things probably better than you assume that I do. We… we create worlds and then folks like you find opportunities inside of ‘em, and then it’s back up to folks like us to try to squash you before you can do any real irreparable harm. I—
[Banshee laughs]
Errol: Oh, it’s funny?
Banshee: No, sorry. Go on.
Errol: I assume that something like this wasn’t really your MO, slicing a guy down in the middle of the streets.
Banshee: I would never! So…ugh, obvious.
Errol: I mean you would, let’s— you definitely would, but you would do a better job of it.
Banshee: Yes, thank you, I do take some pride in my work.
Errol: Yeah, this— you’ve gotta understand, this situation’s mighty uncomfortable for me. I'm not a fan of the stuff you do here.
Banshee: I— listen, I understand. I— this is— what we have here is kind of a mutual opportunity. This is— I— listen. You are an agent of order and law and blehh. I don’t agree with your methods, we don’t see eye-to-eye on that, I understand, but this is mutually beneficial for us. I will give you information to help your investigation, and in turn I— the structure will continue to grow in this area and so my chaos will thrive.
Griffin: The hairs on Errol’s neck this whole time are fucking standing on end. Like, I— this— I want to sort of wave away any sort of narrative dissonance here because Errol’s whole shit is like trying to stop folks like this from hurting the people who they kind of prey upon. But at this point, like, he’s so desperate to keep Dylan alive that I think he’s probably willing to like bend the rules a little bit.
Travis: Well let me make it a little easier for you!
Banshee: You know what? Mr. Ryehouse, this is important to me, so I’ll sweeten the pot. You agree to accept my help, and in return I will owe you a small favor. Small. Do you understand? It will be up to me to determine that favor if you ever request it. But I will be in…your debt.
Errol: We’re trying to solve one murder. And we’re doing it to try to clear the name of a good guy who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. It occurs to me now, sitting here across from you, that you have done many murders, not you yourself. I get that it’s not your style, heck I don’t know if you’ve ever actually killed anybody before, yourself. But what I’m doing now is trying to weigh sort of the… cost-benefit sort of analysis of what dealing with you loses me.
Banshee: Mr. Ryehouse, I can tell you’re a little hesitant. So let me— I will make you an offer. We will work together on this for but a moment, I will give you the information you need and then we needn't talk again. Or. I could, mmm…let’s see…I know that there’s the Black Mariah sitting in town square unguarded currently, if I’m not mistaken. I could maybe buy up all of Carrion Street and foreclose it. Or I could take ownership of that little cashew company your friend owns and close its doors. So those are your options: 1. We help each other, 2. I destroy the things you and your friends care about.
Justin: I think as Errol continues to struggle with this decision, Augustus materializes.
Banshee: Oh!
Griffin: Uh-oh!
Banshee: Mr. Parsons! Pleasure to meet you as well.
Errol: I was goofing earlier, sorry.
Banshee: I— listen. If I’m being honest, I’m not surprised.
Gandy: Well how does this surprise you?
Clint: Gandy visualizes— materializes on the other side.
Banshee: Miss Dancer! What a twist, huh? All three of you here, how could I ever have antici— anyways, what were you saying?
Augustus: Well, I— you of course know the fortunes of the Augustus Parsons Cashew Company have gone south under the leadership of Mr. Garrett Althiser, who has compromised the company. I… understand you're threatening to buy the company, and I— at that point if you were to do that, I would have no chance of reassuming control, which I am still fully capable of doing even in my spectral form, of the company. And I would love to take you up on your offer. Let us be partners in this. You seem a decent businessperson, much as myself, and I would be honored to work with someone of your caliber and gravitas.
Banshee: Excellent!
Errol: Not the other st— she’s not gonna buy Carrion Street, that ain't happening—
Banshee: No, listen! I just wanted someone to say yes.
Travis: And she slides an envelope across to you. And it soon as it reaches the front of you, the spirit that has been occupying the body in front of you leaves it.
Griffin: Oh, fuck.
Travis: Leaving behind the corpse of the old woman it was using to speak with you. And the Banshee is gone from the room.
Clint: Nice disguise!
Griffin: I— I say:
Errol: Shit. I’m sorry guys, I blew that one. That was— I knew we came here for information, that was the closest I ever got to closing a chapter on my life that I— I let it get to me, and I’m— I’m sorr—
Griffin: Are the other two folks still there?
Travis: I mean, you can look.
Griffin: I look, are they still there?
Travis: They’re gone.
Errol: Uh, I let it get to me, and I let it distract me and I screwed the pooch on that one.
Gandy: Errol, Errol, we were all— I was pissed. She threatened my Black Maria, she threatened Uncle Oni. No, that will not stand!
Errol: All right, I guess let’s see what we got out of this.
Griffin: And I open up the envelope.
Travis: So you open the envelope. A key falls out, a house key [theme music fades in]. You pull out the piece of paper that’s in there, and on one side is written an address. A local address, you can tell it’s here in Dry River, not far from where you are now. And when you turn it over, it simply says, “Don’t trust Connors.”

Travis: Previously on The Adventure Zone:
Marcus: You’ve got groups like the Church, the Law, that if this town were to become incorporated, they would lose a pretty big handhold in the Crescent Territory.
Dylan: I loved Jeremiah Blackwell, and he loved Ann.
Augustus: What is the antidote to despair? Well, my friend, it is action.
Errol: Nice to meet you too, uh, Banshee. Yeah?
Banshee: Yeah. Let’s get down to business. I want to help you in this.
Travis: The spirit that has been occupying the body in front of you leaves it and the Banshee is gone from the room. So you open the envelope, a key falls out, uh, a house key. You pull out the piece of paper that’s in there, you turn it over. It simply says, “Don’t trust Connors.”
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Dust Theme by Griffin McElroy) plays]
Travis: So you guys wanna know who did it?
Clint: I already know. I’ve already figured it out. I just didn’t want to reveal it in Episode 2.
Travis: Now this is a thing you used to do when we played Clue or you watched mo- Where you go like “Oh,” and we’d be like “What?” and you’d be like “Mmm, you’ll figure it out.” [crosstalk] You never knew.
Clint: [crosstalk] And I was always- I was always right.
Travis: No, there is no way—
Justin: I did once see Dad solve a Clue game after two rounds of clues, it was amazing.
Travis: I have to think he cheated, I still can’t believe—
Griffin: [crosstalk] He, in some way, cheated.
Justin: Don’t— don’t reopen this wound Travis. Please.
Travis: Okay.
[Clint laughs in the background]
Travis: So, we just put out Episode 3, so it’s fairly recent, so I don’t think we have to go over all the clues again, but so— can you guys give me a quick, like, where you’re at now, what your plan is, I will say I want—
Justin: Can I say something? Let’s go over the clues again!
Griffin: Yeah, I think we at least have an idea now of what is relevant? It’s—
Justin: Here’s the thing I’m starting with: Unless it is Liam, I don’t have a good— I don’t have any other good suspects.
Griffin: Well I think if you want to look at motive, I kind of suspected the sheriff before we got the grim omen from the Banshee because if the town gets incorporated, the Law, I think, loses a foothold in town, right? [Justin: Right.] If they bring in more proper infrastructure and you know, sort of codify the lower case L “law” in town, I think the sheriff loses something and so that might be a reason why they would commit a murder. The thing is—
Justin: Now who was the sheriff vouching for so hard last time?
Griffin: Uh, Tommy Nox.
Justin: Tommy Nox, yeah.
Griffin: So maybe there’s a collaboration that was happening there. The thing- the thing that makes this case so curious is the— [Travis: Benjamin Button] Is how it actually happened. Is the— is that they— somebody knew where Jeremiah and where Dylan was gonna be. Somebody killed Jeremiah in the street, I’m assuming with these gloves, although that could just be a big red herring from Travis, and then somehow got them cleaned and back to the house where Liam was staying before we took notice? There’s a lot— there’s just so many question marks still out there.
Clint: I think we need to lock in some things. I think the gloves is a good example. We have had nothing else that has even come close to being a murder weapon. I think every indicator points to the gloves— I say we lock in the glove as the murder weapons.
Griffin: Unless that’s exactly what fucking Travis wants! Well, maybe we’ll find something in Sheriff Connors’ house. We’re about to go get a big clue, I feel like. So instead—
Justin: Let’s go kick open Sheriff Connors’ doors.
Travis: Wait, was I supposed to be writing this down? Like, am I supposed to know what we’re doing? Oh, no. I’m making this up as we go along, babyyy. Alright—
Justin: Aw yeah, baby.
Travis: Aw yeah, baby.
Griffin: What time is it as we make our way to the address listed on the card?
Travis: I will say it’s about 6 o’clock. [Griffin: Fuuuck.] I mean, you’ve still got some time, but it’s getting there, you know?
Griffin: Okay. I mean, best case scenario for me is we don’t solve it in time and then we have some, like, big hero moment at the sheriff’s station where we like, fend off the whole town gunslinger-style. Just—
Travis: A whole Tombstone moment.
Griffin: Right. This is our justice, et cetera.
Travis: Every town has a story, Dry River has a legend.
Clint: We deal in lead, friend.
Justin: Speaking as someone whose greatest combat ability is um, not getting hurt by things, that sounds a little bit underwhelming to me. I’d like to crack the case, if we could.
Griffin: Alright.
Travis: Alright, so you’re heading to the address on the card with the house key given to you by the Banshee. When you approach the home it is, in fact, to confirm Griffin’s suspicions, it is Sheriff Connors’ home. A couple doors down— about three doors down from the jail house.
Griffin: How many doors down?
Travis: Three doors.
Griffin: [muttering] If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman? [normal voice] Y’all remember that jam? So if it’s near the jail, then it’s not on Carrion Street then, right?
Travis: Correct.
Griffin: Farts. Okay. I was just saying like, there’s no bells here, I’m fucking useless.
Travis: No, but the streets are clear, the windows are dark, you know that the sheriff is still at— You left him at the jail. He said he would keep an eye and protect Dylan, so you’re fairly confident the house is empty. You know from your intel that Connors lives alone. So you can feel pretty confident about using the key and whatnot without having to worry about repercussions.
Griffin: Well, I— still, we should be cautious, I feel like.
Travis: Well, yeah. You’re sneaking into somebody’s house. I was just giving you like, if this was like— if this was a Quest for Glory game, here’s what you know. This is a low stealth check, you know what I mean?
Griffin: So there’s this thing called Let it Out where you extend your senses, supernatural or otherwise to like, just like do like— I’m trying to figure out a way to use my keen wolf senses to like, see if there’s anyone inside the house or any sort of dangers we should be aware of.
Travis: Do it, babyy. I’ve been listening to too much Magic Tavern, I can’t stop.
Griffin: Okay, that’s a six, which is not great, but plus one for Spirit, so that’s a seven. So it’s a hit. So, I do mark corruption…
Travis: Uh-huh.
Griffin: Racking that shit up! Oh, no, I’m just at two, it’s fine. And yeah, I just sorta, like, take a beat, stop my companions and, like, take a deep sniff, a hard sniff.
Travis: So I will say that you do sense some light magical warding on the door, just kinda think, like, security system, you know, like… but not— since you used your supernatural tec— it doesn’t seem to connect anywhere, more of, like, this way, someone would know if someone had gone in, but it wouldn’t necessarily raise an alarm or anything like that. It’s fairly common, this idea of, like, “There was someone in my house,” but it doesn’t connect to a more intricate system.
Griffin: They got that on the window?
Travis: Window and door.
Griffin: So there’s no way of going inside this house without somebody knowing about it.
Travis: Well—
Griffin: Well…
Errol: Hey, Gandy, there’s a little bit of magic something-or-other on the doors and windows here, into the house. You—
Gandy: I have a couple of options. I have a teleport spell.
Errol: Okay?
Gandy: Where I can teleport someone a short distance… it seems to me that would get you past any kind of wards to keep you out.
Errol: I mean, you can bamf one of us, right, but then the other two are still gonna be—
Justin: Augustus floats through the wall.
Errol: Oh, yeah, I forgot, okay, so—
[Travis laughs]
Justin: And he looks at everybody from inside, through the window.
Augustus: Hello!
Errol: … Hi, Augustus, that’s a neat trick, I forgot that that’s why, uh, why you earn the big bucks. Gandy, why don’t you just ‘port on in there and I’ll keep an eye out out here?
Gandy: Very well!
Clint: So… she— oh, nice. In channeling, she’s channeling, that’s a 10…
Griffin: Do you have to ch— sorry, do you have to— I don’t know how the channeling works, but you did it last time and you got three Hold, do you not just continue to spend that Hold, or is there, like, a certain amount of time that you have to go between channelings?
Clint: I dunno, Trav? Trav, is it—?
Travis: Yeah, sure.
Griffin: “When you channel and collect your magics, roll wi-” Yeah, I guess- oh, you can’t channel again this scene. That’s what it is. So it’s, like, scene by scene. So, I guess this is a new scene and you can do it again.
Clint: Okay. I rolled a 10, so that’s…
Travis: Hold three.
Clint: That’s pretty much a Hold three, so a really cool Star Trek kind of effect, twinkle twinkle twinkle, and then I’m inside the room with Augustus.
Griffin: Mmkay. And I’m gonna, like, walk down the stairs off the porch a bit so as not to arouse suspicion, and just sorta keep an eye out down the street.
Travis: [joking] Okay, well, I could follow Gandy and Gus here, but instead, they’ll do whatever, and I think I’m just gonna spend the next hour with Errol on the street. Errol, what’re you doing? You know, just looking around, kicking some dirt, whistling— oh, no, don’t whistle, it’ll draw— oh, what am I going to— [serious] okay, so I go with Gus and Gandy.
[Clint chuckles]
Travis: So, you enter the house, it’s, you know, it’s dark, there’s no candles lit or lanterns, the only thing you get is kinda the ambient— I was gonna say “moonlight,” but here we are, we’re near 6 o’clock, so the moon is real low, so you’re just getting a little bit of ambient light. Gus, I’m gonna say that that’s probably not so much of a problem for you. Gandy, do you have anything that would help you here, I mean, it doesn’t even have to be magical! You could always just, like, light a candle or something.
Griffin: Knowing Gandy, if there is an opportunity for something— for a magical answer to an everyday dilemma, I feel like you have some sort of, y’know, enchanted mag-light.
Clint: And so you are correct, sir!
Travis: Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent.
Clint: She has what’s called the V-Torc. It’s a gold torc she wears around her neck. It’s an artifact, and it has a natural, ambient light that she can use. And it just kind of suffuses the general area around her and Augustus with a warm golden glow.
Justin: Mmm.
Clint: Which goes right through Augustus and…
Justin: It’s very nice.
Travis: Excellent. So, as you enter the room, here in the— you know, his kind of living quarters what you see is on the wall newspaper clippings about his time in kind of more established cities back east, the incorporated territories, where you see a much younger but still clearly Sheriff Connors as a young beat cop, in these more established- in this more established city, which I have not picked a name for but I’m just gonna call it right now the Big City, the BC.
Clint: That’s “Bigg” with two G’s.
Travis: Yeah, B-I-G-G, Bigg the Cat.
Griffin: And “Cityy” with two Y’s.
Travis: Cityy with two Y’s. In Bigg Cityy. And you find newspaper clippings about this young fresh-faced cop who it seems like was very successful. And then they just kind of stop, you know. And the last you see a young man about 25, and then suddenly there’s no more newspaper clippings. And that’s about all you see here in kind of the— I don’t want to say “living room” ‘cause it’s not really that so much as just like, a chair, you know, a table. It doesn’t look super lived in. You kind of get the impression that Sheriff Connors spends most of his time at the sheriff’s office. He only pretty much only comes back here to eat and sleep.
Clint: Is there any more detail in the last newspaper clipping that we found. Anything at all that would indicate what happened?
Griffin: And then he turned evil! “Beat cop goes bad!”
Clint: Well, if something bad happened, he messed up or something, that would kind of explain why he has been, you know, exiled to this place.
Travis: The last story— the last story you can see— is about Connors making the arrest of a low-level enforcer for a crime family in the Bigg Cityy.
Justin: What’s the enforcer’s name?
Travis: The enforcer’s name is…
Clint: Flint Chittles.
Travis: Flint Chittles.
[Griffin laughter]
Justin: Woah, okay, that’s amazing, ‘cause I didn’t think—
Clint: It all comes back!
Travis: [crosstalk] It all ties back.
Justin: [crosstalk] It all ties together.
[Clint laughter]
Travis: Let me see, I’ll give you that name in a moment. Once I look at Twitter.
Clint: So it’s not Flint Chittles.
Travis and Justin in unison: It’s not Flint Chittles.
Clint: That was some good storytelling on my part.
Justin: Who I— I don’t recall who—
Travis: It’s actually just some amazing memory on Dad’s part.
Justin: I just don’t recall who Flint Chittles was.
Griffin: He runs one of the mining companies— or I guess is the manager at the…
Clint: No, it had something to do with— I thought it had something to do with the Augustus Parsons Cashew Company.
Griffin: Yeah, they own the mining company and secured the land from Augustus Parsons—
Clint: Ah, right.
Travis: The name is Bishop, named after listener Holly Bishop on Twitter, thank you for tweeting about the show. Bishop, he was a low-level enforcer for a crime family in the Bigg Cityy. It doesn’t mention what crime family. It’s not even a big article, it seems to be kind of a two-paragraph, maybe buried on like, you know page five of the newspaper kind of deal.
Clint: So a dead end.
Justin: I’m going to extend my senses. I too can Let it Out with my ghostly powers. So I’m going to—
Travis: I keep wanting to sing Let It Go and I want you all to appreciate that I haven’t yet.
Griffin: Thank you Travis.
Justin: Well, considering that it’s Let it Out, that is admirable restraint.
Clint: [To the tune of Let It Go] Let it out, let it out!
Justin: No— well, okay. Well.
Travis: [crosstalk] Done it. You are my puppet, Father!
Justin: [crosstalk] I’m gonna roll… that’s a… what is that, eight? Plus Spirit, which, I’m a ghost, so that’s two. So it’s a 10.
Griffin: So you can choose two effects or take one and no corruption. And I bet I know which one you’re gonna do.
Justin: I’m gonna ignore the corruption and—
Griffin: Woah, nevermind, I was wrong.
Justin: Just kidding, ha ha.
[Travis laughter]
Justin: I’m gonna extend my senses, supernatural or otherwise and I’m going to take one forward on my next roll.
Travis: Okay, you feel two powerful sources. Both of them coming from the direction upstairs. One about, I would say at least twice if not more powerful than the other. But both seem to be going away from kind of his living area and kitchenette and heading upstairs.
Justin: Okay, I’m gonna float upstairs then.
Griffin: Hey, what’s going on outside?
Travis: Well it’s a good question. What does Errol see? First of all, I will say that maybe Errol can see a little bit of that golden glow. Just a little bit, but enough that, you know it ain’t something you’re crazy about seeing there in the window, it ain’t exactly low profile, but the street is still fairly empty. You hear rustling, you can see some lights in windows further down the street, but there’s no one out at this time.
Griffin: If I see lights in windows, am I assuming that people are starting to wake up?
Travis: Oh yeah.
Griffin: Farts.
Travis: Far down the street you can see the worker housing. It’s starting to light up. You know you still have a while. The shift doesn’t start at the mine for while.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: But it’s getting there. Um. Tell me, how’s Errol feeling?
Justin: I was going upstairs to look at the super magic clues and we’re really getting B-roll right now? Like this is what we’re doing?
Griffin: I’ll be quick: I’m feeling nervous.
[Travis laughs]
Travis: Okay, so as you float upstairs you reach what is clearly Connors’ bedroom, and you see in a corner something that you are not surprised to see, and that is a shrine to… one moment, I’ve lost my notes.
Justin: Jesus?
Travis: A shrine to Jesus.
Griffin: “Dear Jesus, give me the power I need to do all the good crime busting today.”
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: “Help me get all the good clues, Jeezy, and, uh—”
Travis: You see a shrine to Limdafel (sp?), who you know is the, kind of demonic presence that The Law — capital T, capital L — was founded by the worshippers of Limdafel. It’s the order— what you know from just general intel, is the followers of Limdafel, The Law, believe in power through order. Now what you weren’t expecting to see is the whole shrine seems to be covered in like a fairly fine but clear layer of dust. There is, as with most shrines you’ve seen, a book laid open. This is how the followers tend to communicate with the people they worship and follow, but the book is burned out through the center. And on investigation, it is clear that the fire kind of— it’s seems that the fire— whatever burned it out was from the middle of the book, and not from outside-in. [Others “hmm”ing] And that is the less powerful supernatural presence or power you are feeling. There is a closet, and that’s where you feel the more powerful supernatural power.
Augustus: Now, Gandy, my impulse is to see what is inside the closet. Would you like to open the door to the closet or would you like me to just sort of duck in there?
Gandy: I have a very strange feeling, but I’m afraid… that if—
Augustus: I understand.
Gandy: —that if it’s magical in origin it might even harm you. How about if I cast Shielding…
Augustus: Yes, I believe a—
Gandy: …to protect us both before we open the closet?
Augustus: Yes, I believe a bit of Prestidigitation is indeed called for.
Clint: Okay so she casts Shielding, which comes off another one of her artifacts. She’s got this jet carved bracelet around her… her…
Griffin: Wrist?
Clint: …wrist! Which would be a good place for a bracelet.
Travis: Yes.
Clint: Do I need to roll anything?
Travis: No, so you still have your— you still have two holds left.
Clint: I still have two holds— one hold left.
Travis: No—
Clint: I used one.
Travis: You have two—
Clint: Oh no, I rolled up again. Okay, so I have two holds left, so I’m gonna use this shielding and…
Travis: Now, if you want to shield everybody in a small area that’s your last two holds, just so you know.
Clint: Right, that’s right. I use two holds to provide plus one armor to everybody in a small area, and that includes me and Augustus, right?
Travis: Correct.
Griffin: Yep.
Clint: Okay, so I cast this Shielding and then I… she reaches out and opens the closet door.
Travis: It’s a good thing you cast that shielding because what is released from the closet is a blast of wild magic. And what you see inside is a second shrine, this one very clearly actively being used. And let’s, um… let’s do Face to a Name. Or Name to a Face.
Justin: Wait, did Dad protect us with a shielding spell?
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: Dad!
Clint: What?
Travis: That was effective magic!
Justin: Dad, you used magic effectively!
Clint: And now I have learned the true lesson.
Justin: Woah, Dad is glowing, and he’s floating into the sky!
Travis: Woah!
Justin: Goodbye, Dad! You did it!
Clint: I will look down upon you from the heavens!
[Griffin laughs]
Justin: Goodbye, our dad!
Clint: Goodbye!
Justin: [crosstalk] This is all Dad was waiting for.
Travis: [crosstalk] We released him from his curse!
Clint: Goodbye, Dolly!
Travis: [crosstalk] I’ll miss him. Goodbye, Dad! I love you!
Justin: [crosstalk] Thank you for listening to the last episode of The Adventure Zone.
[Clint and Travis laugh]
Griffin: Did I hear that from the street?
Travis: I would say maybe like the second floor windows kinda rattled a little bit.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Definitely not, like, crazy, but like, you look up and you see a little kinda maybe swell in the glow you could’ve already seen up there, and the windows rattle a little bit. Yeah, so Gandy and Gus, maybe give me a Name to a Face kinda roll here. Maybe that that will… I’m trying to think of a way that you would identify the shrine. And I think that that’s what would make sense.
Clint: Is that one of Gandy’s moves? I don’t see it on this—
Griffin: It’s a faction move. So you just roll two d6.
Clint: Okay. Five and three. Do I add anything to it?
Travis: So it’s an eight.
Griffin: You roll with Faction, and right now I don’t think we know what the faction’s like— If it’s a god—
Travis: [crosstalk] Okay, so, Power.
Griffin: —it may… Power. Okay.
Travis: Oh no, sorry, it is Wild.
Justin: You know what, I got a plus one to Wild and I rolled a nine, so I got a 10.
Clint: Eight, and then my Power faction is two.
Griffin: It’s Wild.
Travis: That’s okay ‘cause Gus knows this, through all of your ghostly learnings. You recognize this as a shrine to Amdafel (sp?), who is Limdafel’s brother. Amdafel, you know, is the demonic presence whose worshippers believe in power through chaos. Amdafel is the far wilder, less predictable, far more dark sibling of Limdafel. And sitting on that shrine is a similar book to the one that you saw on Limdafel’s shrine, but this one is not burned out, it’s just sitting there waiting for you to open it.
Augustus: No thank you.
Gandy: I… I’ve gotta read it.
Clint: Gandy has to look at it. That’s her whole driving thing!
Justin: Out of the corner of her eye, Gandy notices that Gus is floating down through the floor.
Augustus: Oh no, it’s happening again! I am--
[Griffin laughter]
Augustus: Oh, this is embarrassing, I’ve…oh no.
Justin: And then he’s gone.
Travis: So, Gandy, you’re going to open the book, yes?
Clint: Oh yeah, yeah!
Travis: So when you touch the cover of the book, it springs open, but that’s — here’s the thing — normal for this kind of shrine communication. And what you see is the last communication that happened between Connors and Amdafel, and on the left-hand page is written in fairly normal handwriting, “What are your orders?” And on the right-hand page, in a far more scrawly, jerky handwriting is, “Stop the deal no matter what.”
Griffin: I think it might be a clue, guys.
Justin: It does feel that way to me.
Griffin: My gut is telling me we’re in clue town.
Justin: Alright, Gus floats back up.
Augustus: Well, what did you find?
Gandy: Um, I think it’s a clue.
Augustus: Very good.
Gandy: I think that the note about the sheriff--not trusting the sheriff was really on the nosey.
Augustus: Alright, well it seems that the sheriff is attempting to sow unrest by killing young Blackwell.
Gandy: Then I think you better go bust his ass, Augustus.
Griffin: Well, we could all do it, yeah.
Augustus: Yes, you’re a wizard with apparently infinity— you’re just like—
Gandy: [crosstalk] It does seem that way, doesn’t it— whoo!
Augustus: —Dollar store of like magical trinkets just jingling off your— here’s a list of my super powers: am a ghost, have ghost cashews. Those are my two big things.
Gandy: We need to go tell Errol and we need to go finish this.
Augustus: Yes, let’s report back to Errol. Gandy, are you going to take the book with you?
Gandy: [giddily] Oh absolutely! Do you have any idea what it would be like to communicate with this entity on a regular basis, answer the questions of life and death and maybe even get some penmanship tips because this is really bad cursive here.
Augustus: Being able to communicate with a demonic presence every moment of every day, yes, Gandy, I too have Twitter.
[laughter]
Travis: Topical! Um, so—
Augustus: Topical humor.
Travis: To cut back—
Augustus: And what is Twitter, you might be asking, well… [Clint giggles] … in this world… [sighs] just pretend.
Griffin: Just pretend that he had a good answer there.
Clint: Fantasy Twitter!
Justin: Fantasy Twitter— [indistinguishable]
Griffin: It’s a big bag of 140 birds that everybody carries—
Justin: 280 birds now.
Travis: That’s too many birds!
Griffin: It’s double the amount of birds, it’s a great weight.
Justin: To each bird, a character.
Travis: Um, so back out on the street, Errol you hear the shuffling of footsteps behind you.
Griffin: Behind me towards the house or behind me down the street?
Travis: Down the street. You turn, and there’s Sheriff Connors. And Sheriff Connors sees Gus and Gandy, I assume, coming out of the house.
Gandy: [yells] We got your boooook!
Travis: And he sees the book and says:
Connors: Well, shit. So it looks like maybe an explanation’s in order. Why don’t y’all come back to the jail with me, I can explain everything.
Errol: We could also just sort of do this right here, I would also be curious to hear what’s in that there book.
Connors: Well if y’all will just trust me for a second I’d rather not draw attention to us here on the street, if you know people are starting to wake up, and if you want to keep Dylan safe, I think we need to head back to the jailhouse.
Griffin: I mean, thinking about it, us killing the sheriff of this town in the middle of the street, even if he’s a bad guy, is probably optics-wise not great, so maybe we should try to do this in private. No matter what this confrontation looks like, it’d probably be better to do it without onlookers.
Clint: Yeah, if we get the Grayson internal affairs people involved, that’s gonna be forever.
Griffin: Oh, there’s so much paperwork.
Clint: All the reports, sheesh!
Travis: So! You follow him back to the jailhouse, he walks in, and the first thing he does is he takes out his gun and lays it on his desk and he takes from his calf, strapped to his calf, a long dagger. It looks to be kind of a repurposed bayonet: very long, very thin. He lays that on his desk as well. Kind of a, like, “No threat going on here” kind of deal, you know what I mean, “I’m taking my weapons out.” And let’s say, Gandy, with your experience with magical artifacts, with both gun and dagger, the gun is very polished silver with a black onyx handle, um, and the — it’s not actually silver, you wouldn’t make a gun out of silver, but it’s polished — you know what I mean.
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: Highly polished metal. The dagger, on the other hand, does have running through the center of it from the crossguard to almost the point, a thin line of silver. Both of them share similar sigils that Gandy you know are— magically imbue these weapons so that they are effective against all manner of beings, be they corporeal or incorporeal, fae, or Power, or human, or Night, or whatever. And these are very common artifacts used by the Law that allows them to effectively enforce the law without having to worry about facing creatures more powerful than themselves.
Griffin: Dagger OP? Dagger OP, please nerf.
Clint: I think that Gandy also flicks her wrists and the two matching derringers of hers come out of her sleeves—
Griffin: Whoa. Whoa!
Justin: Whoa.
Clint: —that she’s had — that she established in the first episode! — takes them and puts them on the table right next to the sheriff’s weapons.
Griffin: I’m gonna keep my revolver, I’m great with that.
Justin: Augustus reaches into his pocket and takes out his spectral cashews and puts them on the table.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: Alright.
Clint: And they go right through it! [continues laughing]
Justin: Yeah.
Augustus: It’s prop comedy, I told you.
Griffin: And he says, “Aw nuts.”
Augustus: Aw, nuts.
Clint: Cashews just go right through me.
Augustus: Getting nuts!
Connors: So it seems like maybe we need to have a conversation, huh? Don’t worry about the boy, he’s asleep, no reason to wake him for this. So this looks bad, huh?
Errol: It doesn't look good!
Connors: Let me tell y’all a story. A story about a young man who believed in right and wrong. Who believed in justice. Thought he could make a difference. That young man…
Augustus: Was it you?
Connors: I mean yes, but that’s—
[Laughter]
Connors: A less interesting way but alright, it was me. When I started—
Augustus: I thought it might have been you.
Connors: When I started as a cop, I thought I could change but there’s so much— not just red tape, but corruption. People for whom money was more important than right and wrong and justice, and... I was just beginning to make a difference: shutting down families that were hurting people, that were doing wrong. And then my commanding officer told me to drop it, to let it go, to be satisfied with what I’d done and move on to other things. And I did a little digging and it turned out that my CO was getting paid off by the family, and when I tried to confront it, they tried to transfer me and I walked away.
And I came out here. Came out here to where I could make a difference without having to answer to anybody but myself. And I’ve worked--I’ve worked hard--for the last thirty years to try to change things here, and I’ve… [sighs] You can’t imagine what this town was like when I got here. It was constant bloodshed, and over the last couple years I’ve seen this town heading that way again. And I’m not gonna let bureaucracy come in here, I’m not gonna let red tape come in here, I’m not gonna let corruption come in here and stop me from making this place better. And so… yes, I realize that order wasn’t what the Crescent Territory needed anymore. And things had to be done. And listen, I— I’m not proud of the decisions that I’ve made. But it’s what had to be done to keep people safe, do you understand that?
[pause]
Augustus: Sheriff, did you kill Jeremiah Blackwell?
Connors: …Yes.
Augustus: Well, we can sit here and swap sentences and pontificate on the relative morality of that decision, but I do need to know: are you going to let this boy go?
Connors: Absolu— listen, I can’t— [sighs] This wasn’t supposed to go down like this.
Travis: And he reaches into his desk and he pulls out another set of diggers. Another set of gloves.
Connors: I took these off Liam a while back.
Travis: And they’re coated in blood.
Connors: This is what I used. My plan was to track all this back to Liam, I didn’t— Dylan wasn’t supposed to be there, and so, listen— you have to believe me. No matter what, even if y’all hadn’t shown up tonight, this was never gonna track back to Dylan. Liam’s the head of the workers. I pin this on him, now the Fangs and the Furs don’t trust the workers. A Fur killed a Fang, now the Fangs don’t trust the Furs, the Furs don’t trust the Fangs. We create chaos, law steps in, I calm everything down. Right? We work again to rebuild, we make this town strong— we don’t need— listen, there is money here in this town, from the copper, and from the silver, and Mr. Parsons, you should know better than anybody, when the government steps in and you have to pay taxes and you have to pay politicians and suddenly your money isnt your own anymore, that’s not what this town needs.
Errol: I’ve got a question for you, sheriff. Why did you bring us on? You had to know if we investigated this case, we could’ve figured out what you did.
Connors: Well, I could tell you that I was hoping you’d pin it on Liam, and I could tell you that I was hoping you would side with me at the end but… if I’m being honest, when I planned this, I thought you were coming tomorrow.
[Clint laughs]
Gandy: Then that would’ve cost two innocent people their lives, correct? Jeremiah and Liam.
Connors: Better than a whole town— don’t you understand? This town is dying, and incorporating is its death knell. If you want to save a body, sometimes you have to amputate. You can’t— you can’t save everyone.
Gandy: I know all about death. I’ve learned so much about death, and I know that you placing such lack of emphasis on the deaths of two young men, that’s not your decision to make!
Connors: So whose is it? Who’s in charge here, ‘cause from my standpoint, it’s me. I’ve been saving this town for 30 years, are you really gonna step in here and tell me you would know better, or that anyone would know better? You aren’t here. You don’t know.
Augustus: You’re… You are entitled to whatever feelings that you wish to have. My feeling currently is this: I do not wish Mr. Mathis to spend any more time in his cell, and I hope before we continue our conversation you can release him. If you wish to place yourself in the cell, that is your decision of course, but otherwise I trust that you will stay here.
Connors: Well, as I see it. We got two options.
Augustus: Well let’s hear them, but do make it quick. I’ve made my preferences known.
Connors: Option 1: Dylan goes free of course. We pin this on Liam, we both, you know, step forward, you present your evidence against Liam, I present the gloves. And everything moves forward as planned. The town survives. Option 2: Dylan goes free. You take me into custody. And this town falls into the hands of corruption and bureaucracy, and they don’t trust law anymore. They don’t know right from wrong anymore. And there’s no one left to guide them.
Griffin: I was hoping one of the options would be like a cool gunfight with the sheriff.
Augustus: Yes.
Gandy: Knife fight, even a knife fight.
Griffin: That would have been even cool, too, I think.
Gandy: You have to understand something, sheriff. Our primary goal is to accomplish this job. We were hired to come in here and prove Dylan Mathis’s innocence and to free him from the cell. I can’t speak for the other two, but I personally don’t care about all the rest. And if Dylan is not out of that cell, then we haven’t accomplished our mission.
Connors: Either way, boy goes free. Don’t— you don’t have to worry about Dylan.
Errol: Sheriff, you may find this hard to believe, but we’re speaking the same language here. Last thing I want is for outside interests to come in and force themselves on Carrion Street, change their way of life. We like the way we live on Carrion Street. But if that means living with your justice, if that means locking up innocent folks, if that means killing boys in the street, why are we having this fucking conversation? You killed a boy in the street.
Griffin: And I draw on him and say:
Errol: Sheriff Connors, you’re under arrest for the murder of Jeremiah Blackwell. Can we do thi—
Griffin: I turn to the—
Errol: Can we do this? Are we allowed to, like, arrest folks?
Gandy: Hell yeah!
Augustus: There’s no, I mean there’s no sheriff anymore, so I guess…
[Clint laughs]
Connors: Well, I sure was hoping this would go different.
[Theme music fades in]
Travis: And smoke starts curling from his nostrils. And his eyes start to go yellow, his skin goes purple and chitinous. And he grows about eight inches, and he reaches around and grabs his gun and knife.
{40:16-49:15 ad break}
Errol: Now, hold up a minute there Sparky.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: He cocks his gun. He points the gun at Gandy.
Justin: I’m going to roll to Mislead, Distract or Trick. Mainly, I’m gonna try to distract the— sorry, Connors, so he’ll look behind himself. And that’s— oh shit, nice! I rolled a nine, so I have zero in mind. So nine, and I can pick two: create an opportunity and confuse them for some time.
Travis: So describe to me what you are doing to do this. How are you distracting him?
Justin: I turn invisible, and I chuck something behind his head, so he looks behind himself just for a moment.
Travis: Okay.
Justin: Okay. And that— and when he turns— maybe I throw something off the desk, like the spectral cashews or something because they were material for a moment because I was material for a moment because I became invisible so they became physical and invisible.
Griffin: Now the ramifications of that are wild. That you ca— energy cannot be created or destroyed, and yet somehow Augustus Parsons can generate cashews from the ether.
Justin: Right.
Griffin: Like, we could use this to solve, like, the—
Clint: World hunger!
Griffin: The energy crisis, global hunger, it’s everything—
Justin: Yeah, it’s amazing. These amazing ghostly cashews. So while he’s distracted, and I’m now invisible, what you all see is Gandy’s glasses float off of her face and out the door.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Okay?
Travis: And Connors turns back, points his knife at you, Errol, the gun at Gandy, and I’m gonna say he fires at Gandy.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: Can I take a bullet? Is that too— is that too much?
Travis: You can do whatever the fuck you want, son.
Griffin: Yeah, I definitely jump in the way of the bullet. Should I roll to like, actually attempt this feat, or?
Travis: Yeah, so give me a roll… what would it be? How would you define it?
Griffin: I mean I think probably, so there’s like an assistance move, a Lend a Hand, but that’s like to give them a bonus on a roll. There’s one called Keep Your Cool, which is just like doing something in a tense situation. I think it’s probably that.
Travis: Yeah, roll for that one.
Griffin: That is another six. vPlus one, seven. So “On a seven to nine— on a 10-plus, all’s well, on a seven to nine the MC will tell you what it’s going to cost you.”
Travis: Okay cool, so we’re gonna say that your move was trying to knock Gandy out of the way, and what you end up doing [Griffin: Okay.] is taking the bullet. So the gun is naturally two harm, and in demon form, Connors inflicts plus one harm, so it’d be three harm.
Griffin: Oh Jesus! Okay. I have two natural armor because I’m a— I’m a cool wolf, half-wolf man. So would that just be faint harm then? Mark that?
Travis: Yeah, you’re gonna have one harm, so yes. Light harm.
Griffin: Okay. But a hole in my cool jacket, and that is—
Travis: Hole in your cool jacket, and I will say you also, ‘cause you did like that sweet diving move, you are also like on the ground, you know?
Griffin: Sure, yeah.
Clint: Okay Gandy, she grabs up the derringers from the table, almost instinctually and fires. Now the derringers do one harm each, so two harm. Sev- eight.
Travis: Okay, and also in demon mode, Connors gets a plus one armor, so it’s going to be one harm for that. And because you have to get to the desk to grab the derringers, I’m gonna say that you are in range, so he takes a swipe at you with that dagger, and that would be two harm. Do you have any armor?
Clint: Uh… [nervous laughter] Well, would the shield still be in effect? Is this the same scene as before?
Travis: No, this is a different scene.
Clint: No, no armor.
Travis: Okay, then I’m gonna say you take a healthy cut across your bicep. It begins bleeding, and you kind of feel your arm getting cold and you find it kind of hard to work your right hand.
Griffin: So how do these boxes harm — this is the first like fight we’ve had in this arc — so if she takes two harm, that’s the faint box marked and then one of the grievous, which is like the next level of harm up, or two of the grievous.
Travis: Yes, I believe it’s one faint and one grievous.
Clint: So I’m halfway through grievous.
Travis: You’re halfway through General Grievous, yes.
Griffin: Can I do something real quick?
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: I roll onto my back from the, ‘cause I’m sort of laying on the floor after taking that bullet, and I lean upwards and I shoot the lock off of Dylan’s cage.
Travis: Okay. So, here’s the thing about werewolves. The closer you get to the full moon, the more powerful they are. And the higher moon is in the sky, the more powerful they are and the more— the easier it is for them to transform and to harness that power. So on the days before and after the full moon, it’s harder for them to channel it. And as especially closer to sunset or sunrise, the harder it is for them to channel it. The amount of energy, the amount of emotion that it takes to harness that full power at those times, it’s almost unheard of. So when the now hulking figure of Dylan Mathis cannonballs through his cell door, you get the impression he’s pretty goddamn pissed.
He charges at Connors, Connors goes to turn the gun on him, but before he can, Dylan grabs his hand and you hear a crunch. And you’re not sure if that’s Connors’ bones or the gun or what, but the two of them are kind of locked together there, and Dylan drives him up against the wall with his hand on Connors’ throat.
Connors buries that dagger into Dylan’s ribs, but whether through adrenaline or just sheer force of will, doesn’t seem to have much effect on Dylan. There’s a slight grimace, but he doesn’t let go of Connors’ throat. And he just stares Connors in his yellow eyes and says:
Dylan: You hurt Jeremiah!
Travis: And Connors is gasping.
Dylan: You took Jeremiah from me! You took Jeremiah from Ann!
Travis: And Connors, gasping, says:
Connors: Mercy, please!
Travis: And Dylan looks him square in the eye and says:
Dylan: No.
Travis: And with that, Dylan reaches down and pulls that dagger from his own ribs and buries in the heart of Sheriff Connors. So deep, in fact, that it digs into the wall behind him, pinning his lifeless body there.
Griffin: How does— how does Dylan look right now?
Travis: So as — now that his task is complete, the adrenaline is wearing off, he begins to revert back to human form — as though it is just now hitting him, his hand goes to his ribs and comes away coated in blood, and he stumbles back and falls to his knees. He’s in a bad way, but it’s not an immediate killing blow.
Griffin: Okay. As he’s transforming, I think like, wolf to wolf, I say:
Errol: No, Dylan, stay angry. You’re a lot— you’re gonna be able to survive that thing if you stay in your wolf form. If you transform back to human— Dylan—
[Dylan grunts]
Griffin: I kind of like, slap him and my claws kind of scratch him across the face a little bit. I’m trying to keep Dylan like fucking pissed off until we can like get him to a surgeon or whatever.
[Intermittent Dylan angry noises]
Errol: Yup, yup bud, that’s good. Think about— think about what you lost. Yup, you got your vengeance but there’s still lots of reasons to be pissed off in this world. Yup. Yuup. YUUUP.
Griffin: And I say:
Errol: Gandy, I’m gonna get him to a surgeon, I guess keep watch here and.. not clean up, because the sheriff is pinned to the wall and that’s a mess that’s probably more than one person's capable of handling. But I gotta save this boy.
Travis: And when you open the door, Errol, the— let’s say the noise has drawn attention. Light is breaking over the tops of the buildings, and you’ve garnered a bit of a crowd. Coming down the street is Deputy Rosa, who you see with a couple, who you assume from the way that they’re dressed and the fact that they are with her, are the Blackwells. And Deputy Rosa — when she sees Dylan covered in blood, Errol who has been shot, and hearing the noise and not seeing Connors — her pace quickens. And she runs into the sheriff’s office, and you hear a scream from inside, and she comes back out, gun drawn.
Rosa: What happened?! What is going on, what the fuck?!
Augustus: I believe I might be able to shed some light on that.
Travis: She turns, pointing her gun at you, Augustus, the new sound and appearance.
Augustus: That will do you no good. I am— first, allow me to reintroduce myself, just so you know, I am the spectral form of Augustus Parsons—
Errol: He is bleeding out, Augustus, if you could skip the intro this time!
Augustus: Fair enough. This is my associate’s associate, friend of a friend, associate of associate, Uncle Oni. And I believe Uncle Oni, I gave you the spectacles, could you inform Deputy Rosa of the situation we find ourselves in?
Uncle Oni: I— certainly can. Gandy? Would you like me to?
Gandy: Please do so Uncle Oni, I love it when you get a chance to show off! I love it!
Uncle Oni: Oh I’m so glad I could help, just the agreement from you?
Gandy: The second, yes. It’s the second one, yes.
Uncle Oni: No, this goes beyond question, it seems you very much need this. Are we in agreement?
Gandy: …Yes, Uncle Oni. Especially since I have something that you’re absolutely going to love.
Travis: Okay, but you are going to take a corruption point there, Gandy.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: And with that, Uncle Oni places the spectacles on his nose and closes his eyes and projected, we’ll say is a sheen, a circle of magic whereon projects the whole scene.
Griffin: Onto like, onto the side of the sheriff’s station?
Travis: Yeah.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: This is— sorry, the symbolism of that is fucking tasty as hell.
Travis: And you hear Joseph Blackwell say:
Joseph: God bless it! This is, as you might imagine, a lot to process. The boy! Tommy!
Travis: And a man wearing similar Pince-nez, or however we agreed to pronounce it. But—
Clint: “Ponce-nay.”
Travis: “Ponce-nays,” tinted black with— he looks far too young to have hair a gray as he does, but he steps up.
Tommy: Yes?
Joseph: See to the boy, help— get him to the doc.
Travis: And I assume Errol, you go with? Or let’s say Abigail steps up and kind of ducks under the arm you’re kind of holding up—
Griffin: Yeah, I think I just give her a nod and hand her her son.
Travis: And Abigail and Tommy take him to the doctor. And Michael, seemingly out of nowhere, steps up to Errol, looks you in the eye and says:
Michael: The boy will live. Yes. You’ve done a good job, Mr. Ryehouse. I think that there’s a scene inside the office I should see to?
Errol: To be honest, I don’t care if his spirit goes into a fucking toilet, bud, but you do your job.
Michael: Yes, probably best if this one ends in cremation, don’t you think?
Errol: Yeah, burn it.
Travis: And Blackwell steps up:
Joseph: What?— You have to forgive me, it’s… quite a bit of information to process all at once. What the fuck is going on?
Travis: And Ann steps up.
Ann: I think I can clear a lot of this up, Mr. Blackwell. Jeremiah was killed tonight.
Travis: And you see Mrs. Blackwell just put her hand to her mouth, and suddenly Joseph can look nowhere other than the face of Ann Mathis.
Joseph: Ann, what happened?
Ann: Well, as I think you saw, Mr. Blackwell, he was the victim of… of a much larger conspiracy. You should also know Jeremiah and I were married. A few days ago…
Travis: Joseph looks her in the eye and asks one question.
Joseph: When… when my son died… was he happy?
Travis: And Ann smiles and says:
Ann: I... I think so.
Travis: And they hug.
Clint: Gandy walks over and sidles up next to Uncle Oni, and leans down and looks him in the eyes. She has a grin on her face, and she holds out the book of Amdefell and says:
Gandy: [Whispering] Uncle Oni! Look! A book that lets us directly talk to chaos demons! We are gonna get into some shit! [Giggles]
Uncle Oni: Oh yes!
Griffin: I go inside, and as Michael is preparing the body and preparing to take it away, I take the badge off his corpse and walk back outside. And say:
Errol: This is something that folks in this world rarely get a chance to actually say, but—
Griffin: And I flick it to Deputy Rosa, and I say:
Errol: There actually is a new sheriff in town.
Travis: And she just stares at it. It’s not a happy moment, and she seems in shock, but she doesn’t put it down. And let’s fast-forward just a few moments. Things have calmed down, Abigail has come back. Dylan’s on the mend, this isn’t the first time the doc has seen silver poisoning, and because of your quick thinking Errol in keeping that adrenaline flowing, it’s gonna be alright. And Abigail has told you that she’s wired the Grayson Agency, let ‘em know a job well done. Payment has been issued to the agency as well, plus a hefty bonus. And Joseph Blackwell approaches you.
Joseph: Um, I can’t— I can’t begin to thank you for a job well done. But I must commission a new job from you.
Errol: I mean, I’ll talk to my associates, are you all free? What’s the timetable looking like? We all got any big plans coming up?
Gandy: Are you sure he’s talking to all three of us?
Joseph: I think it will take all three of you. With my son, an heir, gone, I must ask you to journey to Crescent City and convince my daughter to come home.
[Theme music starts]
Travis: So far away, but not nearly as far as you might think, in the underbelly of Crescent City, we see a dark doorway. We see a figure, shrouded, step through that doorway and walk down a dark hallway. They enter a room, and that room appears to be empty. A table. A chair. A lantern. Lit, but revealing nothing. The figure draws back its shroud, and we recognize Isabella Slate. Isabella Slate says:
Isabella: You wanted to see me?
Travis: And a voice, seemingly from nowhere, familiar but not coming from a body we’ve heard, says:
Voice: Yes. Tell me what you were able to pull from the female wizard.
Travis: And unseen by human eyes, the Banshee smiles.
[Theme music (The Adventure Zone: Dust Theme by Griffin McElroy) picks up]"
