"TRANSCRIPT - PRIMER","(Transcribed by Molly Hirsch)
Lucifer: Hello, everyone. Lucifer here. It’s that time of year again where everyone’s busy, so we’re taking a week off from chronicling our adventures to make proper introductions for the characters and the world they inhabit.
It’s frosty out there, but take off that jacket. No need for that. It’s never a cold day down here.
[Blossoms Will Sprout from the Carcass – Skagos]
Lilith: Hello everyone, welcome to Ghostpuncher Corps. If you’re listening to this episode before you check out the rest of them, good job, you are in the right place.
If you’ve already been listening to Ghostpuncher Corps for the past nine episodes and were hoping for a new episode in the isawthearizonalights arc, sorry! We’re recording a different thing. It’s like an introductory show for people who are new to Ghostpuncher, actual play podcasts, or Dungeons and Dragons in general.
So we’re doing this because it’s fucking December 21st. Our normal podcast recording would take place next week, and we’re all going to be fucked up on cookies and merriment by then.
I mean, some of us are already kind of pregaming on the cookies and merriment pretty hard.
Fuck, I—!
Amanda: You alright?
Lilith: They make red velvet Oreos. I’m gonna die.
Amanda: Oh God. That’s not good.
You know, I don’t like anything that can be eaten in sleeve quantity, because I feel like that’s a challenge to me. It’s like Tetris, you know what I mean? I just have to have it reach the bottom every time. It’s not great.
Lilith: Mm-hmm.
Amanda: I’ve eaten a whole row of Oreos. It’s not great.
Lilith: So … we’re recording this podcast for my mother, who’s gonna love listening to an explanation of what the hell this show is, and what any of the shit that she’s going to be listening to means. She’ll love it as soon as she figures out how to download podcasts.
[Syd and Amanda laugh]
Cassidy: I don’t know if that’s a joke or if your mom is— you’ve actually been trying to get your mom to listen to this podcast, but please don’t.
Lilith: She’s tried three times, and I’ve told my sister that her Christmas present to me is to teach my mom how to download podcasts.
Syd: Goodness.
Lilith: Sorry. I know you said please don’t show this podast to my mother. I’m going to.
Cassidy: I just feel like this not the kind of thing your mom would enjoy.
I mean, I don’t know your mom very well, so maybe I’m wrong.
Lilith: I know my mom plenty well, and I think she’d love it. I think a lot of people love it. So many people! Oh it’s so wonderful!
Anyway—
Amanda: At least four!
Syd: So many people already. Already love it.
Lilith: At least four, yeah!
Amanda: At least four people love it.
Lilith: Tens of people are clamoring for this podcast.
This actual play podcast, meaning that we’re roleplaying scenarios set up by me, the Dungeon Master, while my cadre of beautiful friends and my wife play each of their characters solving puzzles and mysteries in this world I’ve set up. It’s like collaborative storytelling with rules and dice, using the framework of Dungeons and Dragons.
Basically, I say like, “Hey, you’re in a fucking room,” and then one of y’all says like, “Ah I wanna punch the wall,” and I say, “Roll the dice.”
Cassidy: How big is the room? What’s in the room?
Lilith: It’s a 9x9x9 room and there is 18 dildos, just in a pile.
Amanda: So a Yayoi Kusama exhibition, basically.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Exactly.
Okay, and then one of you tries to punch the dildos, I make you roll a dice. I’ll say a d20 or something like that. That just means a twenty sided die. And whatever the roll is on that means you succeed or you don’t succeed.
There’s a lot of different things that the characters can do, but it really all just comes down to, “Oh, hey, you roll a dice. You did good at that,” or, “You did bad at that.” That’s really all you need to know about the rules part of Dungeons and Dragons, ‘cuz really we’re just kinda hanging out on a call and telling a weird story together.
So Ghostpuncher started out as a webcomic by me and my friend Ina. You can go to ghostpuncher.net to read it. It’s about a supernatural not-really-crimefighter, more of a—
Cassidy: Investigator?
Lilith: —keeping the peace. Investigator. Among the living and the dead, the demons, denizens of Hell, undead humans, etc. and so on. Either in Hell or here on the mortal plane.
Like I said, you can read that at ghostpuncher.net, it’s been going for a couple years. This summer we kind of split off Ghostpuncher into Ghostpuncher Corps, this podcast. The characters on Ghostpuncher Corps — Petua, Elektra, and Mikey, with possibly more to come! [ghost noises]
[Amanda and Syd also make ghost noises]
Amanda: And they’re all ghosts, I guess, ‘cuz we just—
Lilith: Yes!
Amanda: —spoke that into existence.
Lilith: The characters on Ghostpuncher Corps are other paranormal investigators working for Lucifer, who is sort of a lord of the lands of the living and the dead. She tasks y’all with looking into various assignments. The three of you — Amanda, Cassidy, and Elektra — play Petua, Mikey, and—
Amanda: Amanda, Cassidy, and Elektra?
Lilith [passionately]: Fuck!
Syd: That’s my real name.
Lilith: Yeah. Okay. Dammit.
Amanda: So fuckin’ method.
Lilith: Amanda, Cassidy, and Syd play Petua, Mikey, and Elektra respectively.
Let’s hear a little bit about Petua. Give us just kind of a … what’s Petua’s deal? Obviously I don’t want you to go into spoiler territories ‘cuz everybody has these complex backstories that will be revealed over time.
Amanda: Wait, we do?
Cassidy: Does everybody have those?
Amanda: Oh, I didn’t write one. Oops, sorry.
Lilith: Oh, oh God.
[Amanda and Syd laugh]
Lilith: Yea, every—
Amanda: I didn’t do my podcast homework, I’m sorry, guys.
Lilith: Yeah, Petua just kind of sprang into existence 15 minutes before this podcast started. Everybody else has has a elaborate backstory. But, yeah, tell us about Petua.
Amanda: Alright, so Petua Jones is the character that I, Amanda, play on Ghostpuncher Corps. Kind of like the rest of the cast, I would say … the podcast, if you’re about to listen to it, or if you have listened to it, it starts kind of in medias res, and she, like the rest of the gang, is kind of thrust into this situation with Lucifer, being asked to investigate things that she doesn’t really feel qualified to investigate.
She’s kind of a little bit nerdy, probably a little bit more outspoken than a warlock should be, which is what she is, technically, if we’re navigating D&D terminology. I’m pretty sure I throw that warlock word around a couple times in the podcast.
Lilith: Oh yeah.
Amanda: But it means basically that she’s a spellcaster who draws her power from a source that is not necessarily the usual arcane energy that normal wizards or spellcasters do. And you’ll see that there are a lot of different ways to access magical or arcane power in the Ghostpuncher world, and Petua’s — I’m just gonna say that she’s an art historian at heart, and fundamentally that’s kind of how she ticks, and cultural materials mean a lot to her in a lot of different ways.
She kind of finds herself in this group, and navigating different relationships and trying to sometimes take the lead, sometimes shut herself up a little bit. Much like me, usually.
[Lilith laughs]
Amanda: That’s kind of who she is, I could go into more of it, but basically she is a spellcaster. She kind of comes from mysterious origins, she definitely has lived in the real world for a very long time. That’s another thing about the Ghostpuncher universe, it is set technically in what we would hesitantly call modern day, right?
Lilith: Yep.
Amanda: Just a modern day that’s a little bit scarier than ours in a lot of ways.
Lilith: Mm-hmm.
Amanda: But also a little bit more chill. I mean, if I could cast spells now I’d probably feel better about myself. But yeah, that’s—
Lilith: I’d definitely feel better about myself.
Amanda: Yeah, wouldn’t that be nice just to kind of get it out? I agree.
Lilith: Yeah.
Syd: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. I wanna do some dumb shit with magic.
[Passepied – Gerluz]
[flashback montage starts]
Petua: I mean, look. I’m … just an art historian, and that’s really all you need to know.
Amanda: Then I’m gonna swing my hammer and I’m gonna hit him in the head.
Lilith: His fuckin’ skull caves in. Like, you obliterated this dude.
Amanda: Do I get any on my sunglasses?
Would you believe me if I told you that the troubling aesthetics of braining somebody with a hammer are actually not as upsetting as the troubling aesthetics that Petua has to access whenever she casts a spell?
Uncle Stickey: The challenge that you must endure is a team building exercise, but I prefer to think of it as the ecstatic annihilation of the barriers between you and your teammates.
Petua: I’m gonna go wait in the car.
Uncle Stickey: Prepare yourselves for the pipe organ of doom!
Petua: I really don’t want to see your pipe organ. I’m fine, I think.
Petua: This is gonna sound maybe a little bit presumptuous, but have you ever been in a fight?
Alex: I’ve gotten my ass kicked a few times.
Petua: Alright. There might be a fight, and if that happens, I just want you to try very hard to not die. Because I would feel bad.
Alex: Oh.
Amanda: Alright, so here’s what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna grab the gun, and shoot the guy.
[Syd laughs]
Lilith: Hell yeah.
Amanda: Without taking off my sunglasses.
Lilith: Okay. Does Petua have a history with firearms? Does Petua have experience?
Amanda: [Lilith]. Please.
Lilith: It’s a genuine question.
Amanda: I know.
Petua: Oh you’re the Feds. Alright, buddy, tell us what you know.
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr.: No.
Amanda: I kick him.
[Cassidy laughs]
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr. [confused and indignant]: No!
Amanda: I kick him again.
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr.: Look, I—
Petua: You do wanna.
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr.: I don’t—
Petua: You do wanna.
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr.: I’m—
Petua: You wanna.
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr.: I haven’t—
Petua: ‘Cause here’s the thing—
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr.: I don’t know anything I’ve seen—
Petua: Have you seen The Raptor?
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr.: What? No— uhhh…
Petua: Oh, yeah. So the rabbits report to a guy— you’re gonna love this— eats people.
Jammery/Chris Burden Jr.: Huh.
Petua: So if you had anything to share, now might be a good time.
Lilith: A woman in a beautiful white turtleneck walks out— yeah, I knew that would be all Petua’s jam.
Petua: Um … uh … well … we are, um … Mikey, what do you think about all this?
Mikey: I don’t think she likes you very much.
Petua: Yeah.
Mikey: She seems to like me.
Petua: Yeah, she does. We all like you.
Elektra [whispering]: Lazarus.
Lilith: And she’s looking at Petua particularly interestedly.
Anya: And what’s your name?
Petua: Hi, I … um … my name is Petua. That was really great, what you just did back there! That was really really good. Um … yeah, no, very impressed. I did the other stuff that you saw earlier. That was me. Um …
Anya: Well I wasn’t watching, but okay.
Petua: Oh. It was really good, trust me. It was so good.
Anya: My name is Anya St. John.
Petua: [inaudible] Anya, really nice to meet you.
Anya: Petua—
Lilith: She pulls out a little business card, and it says on it, “Lazarus Foundation, Anya St. John, Head of Security.”
Anya: Petua, let me know … just let me know.
Petua: Look, look, wait, hey!
Amanda: I think Petua, incidentally, when Anya handed her her card, I think I was like halfway into my wallet to give her mine and then I thought better of it.
[Lilith laughs]
Amanda: But I definitely run up to her and, kind of nervously bobbing around whatever the two people are doing, I’m like,
Petua: I don’t think you can do that. I think that’s ours. Right? That should be ours.
Anya: Oh, I absolutely can. That is an interesting misconception, Ms. Petua, but no.
Petua: Well, look, if you’re not going to tell us anything, at least take us with you.
Anya: Okay, Petua. As tempting of an offer that is, I am going to have to decline. You are … hmm, how do I— You don’t have jurisdiction here. Tell Luci I said, “Buzz off.”
Amanda: Can we just have a two-hour interlude where Petua makes everybody watch The Talented Mr. Ripley, please?
[laughter]
Lilith: God.
[Amanda laughs]
Amanda: Oh, I’m a warlock, motherfucker.
Amanda: I kind of get the vibe, and maybe you will too, that Petua does not usually road trip across the United States with strangers, so this is new territory for her.
[flasback montage ends]
Lilith: We are taking that journey in a Winnebago that was procured, I guess, by—
Cassidy: Procured, she says.
[Amanda laughs]
Lilith: Yes, yes. Procured by Mikey.
Cassidy: I mean it is procured, because Mikey actually has no concept of stealing or personal or private property.
I play Mikey, who … it’s not really spoilers, because it doesn’t necessarily mean anything specific, but Mikey’s full name in the Discord that we run this in is Mikey the Sasquatch Boy. Essentially, Mikey is an IRL cryptid. He is a human being who has spent his entire life in isolation in the forest. Petua and Elektra are some of the first people he’s ever known by name.
[cat meows]
Yeah, basically just what if man as animal, entirely driven by his own instrutible thoughts and morality that he has developed from living in total isolation. Also, he’s psychic, and can turn into a giant spider. That’s a thing people like to focus on, too. But it’s not something that Mikey thinks about as being that important to who he is.
Mechanically speaking, Mikey is a druid. I picked Circle of the Moon, just to have my wild shape become a lot more extravagant, because Mikey is less about spellcasting and more about manipulating his physcial form to achieve certain effects.
I don’t know what all is known about Mikey to the other two players at this point. From their perspective, he just showed up to help them wiht a Winnebago, but neither of them have asked him where it came from.
Essentially just imagine a naked 30-year-old man emerging from the woods one day and stealing a camping family’s motor home and running off with it, ’cause that’s literally what happened in universe.
[Kira May – Weedeater]
[flashback montage starts]
Lilith: A Winnebago pulls up in front of you, and I’m gonna let the driver of that Winnebago take over for a second.
Cassidy: So when she says a Winnebago pulls up, what she actually means is a Winnebago screeches to a halt five feet in front of you in a cloud of gravel. If you can just imagine a very heavily bearded, long-haired kind of … just like a hobo-looking motherfucker.
Cassidy: Okay, well Mikey is gonna push that button literally unless somebody stops him.
Amanda: Yeah, I could have called that. I think that we all saw that coming.
Elektra: I don’t know if that’s a good idea.
Cassidy: Like I’m walking towards the button right now.
Kevin: I’m fine with this.
Elektra: I don’t know that we should … press that.
Cassidy: He’s at the button, he’s about to push it. I mean, unless somebody physically stops him or tells him not to.
Cassidy: Oh wait, is it dark?
Lilith: It’s very dark, yes.
Cassidy: Okay, I’ll cast Produce Flame. You all look away for a second, before you know it, Mikey’s hand’s on fire.
Cassidy: I guess it’s just time to do what Mikey does best.
Something happens which is deeply disturbing. From a mechanical aspect, this is Mikey’s first use of the Wild Shape ability. Some Altered States evolutionary regression kind of stuff. Just sort of like a fucked up gorilla-esque human ancestor.
Cassidy: Mikey is just gonna sort of explode, not out of his shirt, because thankfully the pug face t-shirt is a XXXL. His skin starts to sort of harden and split in places, especially at the joints and his abdomen, and then another pair of limbs bursts from his ribcage. I’ve Wild Shaped into a giant spider.
Syd: Oh lord.
Cassidy: He’s like the second-to-last photo from the cover of an Animorphs.
Cassidy: I’ll go back to my regular shape, which is just as gross of a process as turning into the giant spider, let’s be clear. There’s a lot of crunching and popping noises that accompanies any of Mikey’s Wild Shapes.
Amanda: Mm-hmm.
The Raptor: Nature of being forthcoming, I am a cannibal, so…
Mikey: What’s a cannibal?
The Raptor: I won’t eat you three.
Mikey: You mean he eats people?
The Raptor: I do eat other people.
Mikey: You eat people?
The Raptor: You guys seem a lot more interested in being judgy and weird about stuff that—
Mikey [emphatically]: You eat people.
The Raptor: That’s true. That’s—
Peregrine Asterley: Mikey—
Lilith: And he sort of pats Mikey on the shoulder.
Cassidy: Mikey visibly recoils from his touch.
Lilith: You can definitely feel that he is wiping his hand off on Petua’s sleeve.
Petua: My God, he’s not a pet. It’s fine.
Mikey: What’s a pet?
Petua: Not you, no matter what he says.
[crunching noises]
[flashback montage ends]
Syd: So, Elektra, okay. At her core she’s an electronics hobbyist, SoundCloud musician, so she has a passion for most things electric. That is her genre.
She comes from vaguely around the Puget Sound area. Not necessarily a standard home, just kind of crashing in a lot of places or I guess a vehicle she may have had at some point. She’s a bard, as mentioned, a musician. Not really a whole lot I have to deviate from.
Lilith: She’s got a lot of really cool gear though, for a bard.
Amanda: Yeah.
Syd: Yeah, so she does stuff herself. She’s very into DIY, and like I said an electronics hobbyist.
Cassidy: I mean let’s be clear, Mikey has the best piece of equipment in this entire party. And that is of course the pug t-shirt.
Amanda: The pug shirt? Yeah, I was gonna say.
Syd: Yes, of course, of course.
Lilith: Yeah yeah yeah.
Amanda: Vital.
[Muroc Air Field – Georges Rodi]
[flashback montage starts]
Syd: So being a magical bard, she’s also passionate about the arcane arts that eventually led her to figuring out things about the magical world that she ties into her musical abilites with her bitchin’ gear.
Elektra’s like 5’7″, medium built. 25. She’s got one of those emo-goth haircuts everyone’s all about these days, a little side cut swooping purple … few piercings. Sega Mega Drive chip hanging from one ear. Just kind of a all-around cyberpunk babe.
Syd: Elektra, during our conversation was a little bit distracted, not paying attention. She was setting down her gear and taking the sleeves off of her jacket.
Cassidy: Is that like a zip or like a button kind of thing?
Syd: It’s a zip.
Amanda: Or just rip it— oh, I thought you were just ripping them off.
Syd: Her sleeves zip off.
Cassidy: Because I feel like Elektra is so advanced in this cyberpunk fashion game, those sleeves might even be magnetic.
Syd: Ooh, yeah.
Lilith: You also see a woman who is, you’re sure, like seven feet tall at the very least, and she is built.
Elektra: Hi.
Uncle Stickey: As I said before, Bernice will take all of your items away if you do not pass these challenges.
Amanda: Oh, I forgot about Bernice. Alright, well fuck it.
Syd: What’s Bernice up to?
Bernice: Got my eye on you.
Lilith: And she points two fingers at her eyes and then two fingers at Elektra.
Syd: Elektra giggles.
Bernice: I know your type.
[Syd laughs]
Petua: I think you are her type.
Lilith: The door opens quite quickly, and you see a woman in a button-down top.
Syd: Where is this look, between school marm and sexy librarian?
Amanda: ‘Cause I’ve already got both locked down at once.
Lilith: Halfway between school marm and sexy librarian and then like branch off into plucky bisexual. Is that?
Syd: Oh!
Elektra: Well, hello.
Celeste Price: Howdy.
Celeste Price: What’d you expect me to be doin’? Backflips?
Petua: Well, I— I mean— [laughs uncomfortably] I mean you certainly look like you’re capable of that, but really I was more wondering—
Celeste: I am pretty flexible.
Elektra: Hmm.
Amanda: Petua just kind of looks at Elektra like, gotta chill, girl. You gotta chill.
[laughter]
[flashback montage ends]
Syd: How else to describe her? I mean, she’s like a nerdy goth chick, I guess.
Lilith: Yeah. That’s exactly— nerdy goth chick, but I feel like she’s also the high fashion icon of the party, ’cause she’s—
Syd: Yeah. Very stylish, very … a lot of very specific stylings that aesthetics also play into a lot.
Lilith: A lot of cyberpunk stuff, lot of—
Syd: Yeah.
Lilith: Gadgets and gizmos.
Syd: A lot of it is relative to the types of thing that she works with. Arcane symbols and electronic paraphernalia.
Lilith: But she also has a fucking bat, doesn’t she?
Amanda: Oh yes.
Syd: Well, yeah, so I was gonna get into that.
Lilith: Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Syd: I’m gonna into it. So I was gonna talk about, as a hobbyist she liked helping others with their hobbies, and so her abilities have been kind of fixated towards support, but she also likes fucking shit up! Vis a vis with her bat, named Wendy Carlos, which, you know, one of her heroes.
Wendy Carlos, she’s a electronic artist stemming back to the 60s and 70s. She was a major pioneer, and she’s also a trans woman. She has lots of cats.
Cassidy: She also did all of the good Kubrick soundtracks.
Lilith: She was a massively influential— she did the Tron soundtracks, the Switched on Bach albums.
Cassidy: You could argue that she was the first person to truly make music that is purely electronic.
Lilith: All y’all motherfuckin’ frat boys owe your wub wubs to your local trans woman. Go fuckin’ find one and PayPal them $20 right now, okay?
Amanda: Or just fuckin’ donate to this podcast, honestly.
Lilith: Yeah! That’s not a bad idea.
Amanda: ‘Cause Syd does do electronic music for this podcast, which is also super cool.
Syd: Yes, that’s the other thing, I was getting there. Sorry, I’m not a very well-spoken person.
Lilith: That’s alright, you’re good.
Syd: I also myself do electronic music, so I supply all of the beeps and boops that are attributed to Elektra. She’s got a temper, especially if you fuck with her gear. Don’t do it.
Lilith: Don’t do it.
Syd: Just don’t.
Amanda: Don’t do it.
Lilith: So that’s actually— that kind of segues into something else I wanted to talk about. There’s a lot of music that gets used in this show. I pull a lot from musicians who put their work in the creative commons. [whispers] I also occasionally use tracks that aren’t in the creative commons, please don’t tell on me.
Amanda: It’s appropriation, alright? It’s bricolage, it’s fine.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah! Whatever. It’s transformative or something.
You can always find the links to the music that is used in the show beneath any of the episodes. You’ve already heard it once in this podcast, one of the most important songs to Ghostpuncher Corps, Blossoms Will Sprout from the Carcass is our intro and outro song, it’s by this band called Skagos. They are a atmospheric Black Metal band, kind of post-Black Metal band from I believe Victoria, British Columbia.
Amanda: Shut up! Oh my God, not you guys. I’m sorry. It’s the cat.
Lilith: You’re good.
Cassidy: We can hear the cat, it’s okay.
Syd: Everyone shut up, we need to listen to the cat.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah, no. Audrey needs to speak. Give her the floor! Stop silencing her!
Amanda: You’re so valid, honey, I’m so sorry. You’re so fat and buttery smooth and valid.
[Syd and Lilith laugh]
Lilith: Let her speak!
[Amanda laughs]
Amanda: I hate this.
Syd:I love you guys.
Amanda: I’m actually holding my cat up to the microphone like a little cornucopia of tabby fur, and she just is givin’ me the bitchiest, brattiest look, like, “Bitch, what the fuck do you think I’m doing? I’m not a trained monkey. I’m not gonna shout unless it’s to get your attention.”
[Syd meows]
Amanda: Foley work! We got it!
[Clap, laughter]
Cassidy: That was really good.
Lilith: Alright, y’all.
Amanda: It’s really realistic.
Syd: Oh, fuck.
Amanda: We all have like, 20 cats, also I think between us, right? How many cats?
Syd and Lilith: Yeah
Lilith: I think, actually, there’s one cat per person on the podcast, if I’m not mistaken.
Amanda: We should just do an episode where our cats play as us instead.
[Lilith laughs]
Syd: Piplup will just end up eating my notebook.
Lilith: Yeah, Necrobutcher would be a terrible DM. Total party death, no matter what.
Last thing I wanted to cover, this show is supported by the Ghostpuncher Patreon. That kind of feeds into both Ghostpuncher the podcast, Ghostpuncher the show.
There’s actually a lot of people working on both of those, and the Ghostpuncher Patreon is really the only way that we get any compensation for all of the work and all of the investment that we put into it, so if you like the show and you feel like kicking us even as much as a dollar a month, you actually will be getting— whenever I finish the episodes, if it’s before the usual Thursday posting time, I will usually throw them up on the Patreon, so that any of our Patreon donors from $1 up can access the episode early, for free.
Enjoy the podcast? I don’t know. I don’t know how to end this episode.
Amanda: Alright, wait, we should all ask you a question now that you’ve grilled us.
Lilith: Yes! Ask me questions!
Syd [in realization]: Oh!
Amanda: I think we should all ask our DM a question.
Lilith: Yes.
Syd: The turns have tabled.
Amanda: Oh, the tables have turned.
Cassidy: This is actually something I’ve been wondering. To what degree does the Ghostpuncher world diverge from ours? Beyond, “There are supernatural things running around.” In terms of its history.
Lilith: It’s very comic book-y, in that it mirrors actual events, but for anything that dips into storyline, which I kind of leave that open ended.
There may or may not be correlating events, depending on … say, for example if some orange motherfucker were to show up in an episode of a podcast and something real, real bad happened, or he was put somewhere where he can’t hurt anybody. I wouldn’t name that person anything. There’s just this orange thumb, and, again, we put him in a box where he can’t hurt anybody. He’s safe and warm and he has I guess enough food, but he can’t hurt anyone.
Cassidy: I don’t know if that answered my question or not.
Lilith: It did not answer your question.
Amanda: No. You just really wanted to talk about trapping [redacted] in an invisible box, I guess.
Syd: Woah, woah, woah.
Lilith [mock aghast]: No I didn’t! No!
Syd: Woah.
Lilith [still mock aghast]: What are you talking about? I have no idea-
Syd: Nobody named any names.
Amanda: No.
Lilith: No, let me take another stab at answering your question. It is basically the real world. There are a couple actual historical figures that have roles in events of the Ghostpuncher universe. If we go back-
Cassidy: Broadly speaking, its own history mirrors our own.
Lilith: Yes.
Cassidy: Okay. That’s what I was trying to establish.
Amanda: I think for the number of cultural references that get dropped in every episode, that tracks.
I will say that I do think that it’s pretty apparent, if one is to listen to Ghostpuncher, that the source material is a comic, because, to me, the comic book-ification of a world is pretty much this in that it has a stylistic overlay onto the real world, and it doesn’t necessarily mean that the history is different, it just means that the vibe that people give off is a little different than a realistic fiction would be, because the world that it’s commenting on isn’t necessarily our world, it’s its own world if that makes any sense.
You know what I mean? Everybody’s a reflection of the own mythos of that world. Not to get all emotional about Ghostpuncher or whatever, but…
Cassidy: I definitely think we’re on the same wavelength, especially about interpreting comic book worlds that way.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah.
Amanda: That leads me to my question, which is: what was it, and I kind of know this already, but specifically especially because of the way— ‘Cause I’ve looked through Ghostpuncher and I’m a fan of Ghostpuncher and I— In terms of the mechanics that operate in this game, and specifically using D&D and also just doing a podcast, what made you specifically want to kind of assemble this team and actually make a podcast out of it?
‘Cause it’s not— I think that they speak to each other as two separate works of fiction, but what was your inspiration for getting into this whole game?
Lilith: There’s lot of— ‘Cause there’s a lot of answers to that. I definitely wanted to expand the world of Ghostpuncher. Comic books are very— especially a webcomic, it’s kind of a slow medium, even if we were keeping a regular update pace, which we’re not always able to.
This is something where I can tell stories, tell stories, tell stories about this universe that I’ve been … I have been building and tinkering Ghostpuncher for I have lost count of how many years. Ghostpuncher started out as a feature film script, then turned into a comic. I have something like probably 10 years of Ghostpuncher comic material written out.
Syd: Excellent
Amanda: So good.
Lilith: Yeah, so I had been breathing this world for so long, and I was just like, “I wanna do more with it.” So I got three— actually we started out four of my favorite people in the whole wide world, and—
Amanda and Syd: Awww
Lilith: —made them play D&D. If we can be honest, the success of a lot of other actual play podcasts also inspired me to— this is definitely a very appropriate medium for me to use to explore this world.
Amanda: Do y’all ever think about the fact, not to geek out here, I’m sorry, I’ve had some wine. I was thinking about the fact that D&D having a resurgence in this particular moment, as opposed to the early 2000s— maybe there was one, I don’t know. I always feel like now it’s getting bigger again. I always wonder.
Cassidy: I definitely feel like there was a resurgence around when 4th edition D&D came out.
Amanda: I was just curious about when it—
Cassidy: Towards like 2007, 2009-ish. To me that’s like the second wave of it.
Amanda: I’d believe that. I was always curious about whether that was a cultural thing or if it was just like the game getting good again. I don’t know. Sorry. You can cut that out, [Lilith]. I was just curious about that.
Lilith: No, no, no. I mean that’s one thing that’s worth mentioning. We are playing Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, which came out just a few years ago, and it is a system—
Syd: It’s very good.
Lilith: —that I have taken to a lot. It’s a system a couple other actual play podcasts … maybe some of you out there have heard of The Adventure Zone. It’s that wildly popular podcast that literally everybody listens to.
Cassidy: I don’t listen to it.
Lilith: And if you don’t listen to it, the people around you won’t shut up about it.
Cassidy: That is true. I have noticed that.
[laughter]
Amanda: It’s just homestuck with dice at this point. It’s fine.
[Lilith laughs]
Syd: That’s … Jesus.
Cassidy: That makes me so good about my decision not to listen to it.
Amanda: Just in terms of the obnoxiousness of the people who like it, I’m not talking— Well, actually. No.
Syd: I mean fandoms are just…
Amanda: We’re not talkin’ about that.
Lilith: No, no, no, no.
Syd: Anyway.
Lilith: Fandoms are wonderful! We love fandoms. We love our fans. We love anybody who like our stuff.
Cassidy: If you make fanart of Mikey, and I think that it’s bad, I will tell you that it’s bad on the internet. That is a thing I am going to do.
Lilith: Cassidy, be nice.
Cassidy: Full stop.
Amanda: Nonononono, this is the spice. This is important. This is adding appeal. This is not ass kissing, this is real and gritty and raw. It’s important.
Lilith: Mm-hmm (affirmative)
[crosstalk 0:36:28.7]
Lilith: Then it’s important to, on the podcast, ’cause I think with Elektra and Petua we have kind of left it open-ended, but Mikey has a very specific—
Cassidy: I mean he doesn’t really. I just feel like people’s interpretations of Mikey— I’m curious to see those. But I’m definitely not gonna not tell people that their interpretation of a character is wrong. There are ways you could interpret Mikey that are just straight up wrong.
Amanda: I actually will say, I do like that. Not gonna lie, I think that not enough people take a stand about the creative material that they put out into the world and take ownership of it.
Cassidy: First and foremost, Mikey is my character. I decide who he is and what he is like. I’m not opposed to people having their headcanons or whatever about him, but if your headcanon for Mikey is that he’s seven feet tall, that’s wrong. ‘Cause he’s not.
That’s a very simple example, but…
Amanda: It’s true.
Lilith: One thing I did kind of want to mention: eventually, these characters will have, no matter how open we leave it on the podcast, there will be a quote-unquote “canon” appearance, because they are eventually— This podcast has— It’s very far in the future, but it has an end point, and at that end point, these characters actually join up with the comic. That’s about all I can say at this point. But that is something that will happen eventually.
Cassidy: I just can’t wait to see what Ina does as far as drawing Mikey’s Wild Shape.
Amanda: Oh my God. I’ve thought about this couple times, and I’m so excited to see … it had always been a pipe dream because I honestly, until this moment, did not know if there was a plan to incorporate the gang into the comic. I’m so excited to potentially see that.
Cassidy: I don’t want what I said earlier to discourage people from making fanart, ’cause I would be absolutely fucking stoked if anybody draws fanart for this show. That would be cool as fuck, and a couple people—
Amanda: People have, and it’s been dope.
Cassidy: Yeah, a couple people have already.
Lilith: It has been amazing, oh my God.
Cassidy: And I legitimately did like that other piece of fanart that somebody posted on Tumblr, even though I reblogged it saying that Mikey is in fact not tall.
Syd: Oh yeah, that was awesome.
Cassidy: But that the art was cool.
Lilith: The art has all been great so far. Keep it coming, tag us in it. I’ll always be reblogging or retweeting or whatever that shit onto the official Ghostpuncher channels, and we always really appreciate that. We really appreciate people posting about the show.
Cassidy: We also appreciate donations to the Patreon. We probably appreciate that more than anything else.
Amanda: Yeah, we kind of do.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah.
Cassidy: Or at least [Lilith] does.
Syd: Also, what will become painfully clear throughout the podcast is Elektra is definitely gay.
Cassidy: Oh yeah, that’s I think already.
Syd: Don’t get it twisted. I don’t want any straight fancanons out there.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah, no. Trying to ship Elektra with a man is…
Cassidy: Don’t ship Mikey with anyone, please.
Amanda: Yeah, please.
Cassidy: Just leave him alone.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah. I don’t think that’s something that is even … yeah. Just don’t. Just don’t do it. Like, friendships and stuff.
Amanda: You can do whatever the fuck you want to Petua. Fandom bicycle Petua Jones, I’m ready for it. I’m ready to accept it.
[Syd laughs]
Lilith: I figure that’s…
Cassidy: Petua Jones x Uncle Stickey?
[laughter]
Syd: Oh Jesus.
Amanda: I mean…
Syd: Blocked.
Amanda: No. I mean, Petua’s … if you get it, you get it. And if not, you can spend whatever time you want, doing whatever you want, but it means you don’t get it. So that’s okay. That’s all I’m gonna say about Petua, but please just exert all of your weird sexual—
[laughter]
Amanda: I’m a veteran of this shit, I can do it. I can handle it. Please.
Cassidy: If you draw erotic fanart of Mikey the Sasquatch Boy I will come to your house and beat you up. I swear to God that is a promise.
Syd: I will help.
Lilith: I believe her. I won’t help ’cause I don’t like getting my hands dirty, but I do love watching my wife beat up people. So.
Cassidy: You’ve never even seen that.
Lilith: I know. I want to so bad.
Amanda: She specifically made this podcast just on the off chance that she could finally see it.
Lilith: Syd, I don’t think I ever got a question from you. Did you have a question for me?
Syd: I’m so bad at this. I was gonna end up defaulting to … are you having fun? How are we doing?
Amanda: Yeah, are you having fun?
Lilith: I am having so much fuckin’ fun with this podcast. This is—
Syd: Fuck yeah.
Lilith: This has been one of the most— I have been … I’m gonna wax poetic about creativity for a second here.
Cassidy: Oh, please.
Lilith: From high school through my whole career in college, I was a writer and I mostly wrote screenplays for student films. Usually those would … I would say maybe 10% of my screenplays got turned into finished things, and I always had to write them under, “Oh we can only film this for $5 and we’ve got three people and none of them know how to act.” Always working under huge limitations.
So actually Ghostpuncher started out as, the minute I graduated college, I was so exhausted by that kind of limitation, that I sat down and I wrote a feature film script called Ghostpuncher, and I said, “Okay, the goal here is to write something that would take us $300 million to film and that three people would want to see.”
That original script, I think is definitely— There’s a lot of really crazy shit in there, and like I said, but it morphed into the Ghostpuncher that we have today.
But kind of the whole thing is it is an exercise in the uninhibited excess. Ghostpuncher is kind of all the crazy shit that I’ve always wanted to do in fiction and everything like that, and in the past I’ve had to kind of choose what I want to do based on the limitations of my medium, but comic books, podcasting— Doesn’t cost any money to say, “Oh and then everything explodes,” because it’s all theater of the mind shit.
So yeah, I think we’ll close the podast out on … everybody imagine a giant mech, and a lobster that’s 400 feet tall. The mech has a giant hammer and sickle spray painted on the side of it — you’ll learn why — and the—
Syd: Sure.
Cassidy: I already know why.
Syd: Can imagine.
[laughter]
Lilith: And so this mech and this—
Cassidy: I actually do, I know a lot secret Ghostpuncher lore that nobody else does because [Lilith] makes me read her scripts.
Lilith: That’s…
Amanda: Fullest lore.
Lilith: That’s true, that’s true. So this communist mech and this lobster—
Cassidy: It’s like being Gene Roddenberry’s wife.
[Lilith and Syd laugh]
Lilith: It’s not comparable to that, at all.
Cassidy: It’s not comparable to that at all.
Lilith: Oh, God.
Syd: I hope we get an equivalent of Lwaxana Troi in this podcast.
Cassidy: God I hope so.
Lilith: Oh, it turns out that Uncle Stickey’s just like 40 tribbles in a trenchcoat. Anyway—
Amanda: Are you kidding me, I would die.
I feel like Mikey would love tribbles, and so would Petua. Well, no, Mikey—
Lilith: God, am I gonna have to include tribbles in the podcast, now?
Cassidy: You don’t have to include any of the dumb shit we mention. You do sometimes and I’m not sure why, but godspeed.
[Syd and Lilith laugh]
Amanda: You’ve really fucked up your lobster mech Pacific Rim sequel, whatever the fuck that was.
Lilith: Oh, God, that was gonna be my dismount.
Amanda: Listen, listen. It’s either Pacific Rim, or the best Broadway production of The Little Mermaid you’ve ever seen, and we’re just gonna leave it at that.
[Lilith laughs]
Syd: God.

Lucifer: Hi, Luci again. Just a quick request for you. If you have any friends who are into D&D, the supernatural, cryptozoology, or lesbianism, maybe shoot them a link to this episode of the podcast.
Word of mouth always helps us grow, and this episode in particular is a great introduction, especially for people who might not be familiar with this kind of show. Now, go forth, do my dark biddings my darlings."
"TRANSCRIPT - EPISODE 1
""Ah, Nuts"" vol I","(Transcribed by Lilith)
Lilith: Hello everyone, My name is Lucifer, and welcome to Ghostpuncher Corps.
[Music fades in: Skagos – Blossoms Will Sprout From the Carcass]
This is the story of a group of adventurers working under my employ to investigate, track and retrieve souls who have escaped my domain.
It’s not pretty, it’s not glamorous, but it’s incredibly necessary. We can’t have ghouls, spectres and zombies running amok on the land of the living.
This week, we meet our heroes for the first time, and our heroes meet me. We have a quick chat about the details of the job and they take their first assignment, investigating a series of deaths in Poulton, TX.
See, an employee of a car shop called Jackie’s custom’s died in a manner most foul as a result of negligent management.
Since then, folks connected to the shop have been turning up dead, seemingly killed by an unseen force inside rooms that no one should have been able to get into.
Our adventurers will have to investigate, and figure out a way to take down whatever hellish spectre is haunting Poulton. Let’s see how they do, in this, the very first adventure of the Ghostpuncher Corps.
[Musical interlude]
Lyrics: We walk upon the soaked carcasses of those who once gave us life
Lilith: We’ve got, um. Petua. Played by, um, Amanda. Elektra, played by Syd. And, um, I’m sorry, forgive me Robyn what’s your character’s name again?
Robyn: Kevin
Lilith: Kevin! Right. So the three of you have been summoned. You’re in this kind of dark room, the walls are, like, carved obsidian. There’s a desk at the center of the room and there is a woman with bright red skin, uhm, wearing a–I cannot tell you guys how impeccably tailored this pantsuit is. It looks fucking bangin on her.
[Music fades in: Gimme a Break by netra]
Cassidy: What’s the shoulder pad situation?
Lilith: Ah, it’s not ostentatious, but it’s there.
Cassidy: But it’s definitely there.
Lilith: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Cassidy: This is a woman with like, like. You would describe, the suit is maybe not a power suit, but there’s power in there.
Lilith: Oh yeah. There’s a little bit of power in there. And, uhm, you see a pair of cute little horns poking out from underneath a, uhm, a quite conservative haircut. And in front of her, in front of her desk are three chairs and she’s kinda gesturing for you to sit at them.
Syd: Um… I just kinda look at the other two and then I, uh shrug and sit down.
Amanda: I also sit down.
Robyn: I think I’m gonna sit down.
Lilith: Okay! Alright! Well, welcome welcome welcome. I suppose you all uhh, you all know me. I’m Lucifer, you can call me Luci. This is just kind of a little meet and greet before I give you guys your first assignment, just wanted to put faces to names, make sure all of you can log in to the HR portal, all that kind of good stuff. Ummm… Let’s see, it looks like we have, uh, Petua here? Is that right?
Amanda: Uhh I kind of look up as if I wasn’t expecting my name to be called and I go, uh. “Yeah, yeah, definitely here”
Lilith: Okay. Alright. And, uh, Elektra?
Syd: Present.
Lilith: Fantastic. Uh, and, and Kevin.
Robyn: Yeah. Um um, I’m slouched in my chair. I got my arms crossed and I just go “Yeah, that’s me.”
Cassidy: Can we have like a brief physical description of uh, Kevin, Elektra, and Petua?
Lilith: I would love that, yeah.
Robyn: That’s great
Amanda: Sure. Uhh, so Petua is about 5″ 6′, I would say and kind of, like, if you were to try to place her age, maybe you would say like late 30’s, early 40’s. She’s got a long, dark crop of hair that’s kind of braided back and she wears glasses. And I’ve kind of got a shrewis—euugh—shrewish sort of face I guess you would say? Maybe somebody you wouldn’t want to get into an argument with, that’s kind of the vibe.
Cassidy: So, the librarian but not, like, hot librarian.
Amanda: No, definitely, like yeah, like will school you on, like, library sciences and actually knows the Dewey Decimal system kind of librarian.
Lilith: Hell yeah.
Robyn: Kevin’s kind of, just, oh man how did I–He’s very just a waspy, just bland-ass dude, not much to him, just pretty messy brown hair. Uhh. The way I described him on my character sheet–kinda like one of the uglier guys in nirvana?
[Everyone laughs]
Robyn: You know, before they all got hot? Just a real, like, boring, wiry lookin guy, who cares?
Amanda: So like kind of a douchebag is what you’re saying?
Robyn: Yeah! Exactly!
Lilith: Little bit of a douchebag, okay!
Amanda: Alright
Robyn: A little bit of a douchebag.
Lilith: I’m into that, I’m into that. Elektra?
Syd: So Elektra’s like 5″ 7′, medium build, 25. She’s got one of those, one of those emo-goth haircuts everyone’s all about these days, little side-cut swooping purple.
Lilith: Yeah
Syd: A few piercings. Sega MegaDrive chip hanging from one ear. She’s kind of a all around cyberpunk babe.
Lilith: This is… A fantastic look. Um I don’t know–um, uh–where do we get fan artists Um?
Cassidy: I think we actually have to have fans first.
Lilith: Right!
Amanda: Yes! And we actually have to have a show before either of those things happen.
Lilith: Okay! Okay! Putting the cart before the horse, but like, I mean…
Amanda: Lil bit.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah.
Syd: She’s kind of like Sombra, but a different kind of hacker.
Lilith: I love it, I love it.
Amanda: She’s hacked her way into our hearts.
Lilith: I–certainly she’s hacked her way into mine.
Lucifer kind of, uh, she gets up. Just uh, really quick, here’s the job: I’ll give you what intel I have on some kind of undead entitity that’s causing a disturbance in the land of the living. Go there, do your thing, make sure whatever it is knocks it off or fucks off back to hell. Simple enough, right? Any questions.
Amanda: I…. I have a few questions. Um… Do we know anything–You’re going to tell us about the undead entity and what happens to them after we, “fuck them back into hell” as you said?
Lilith: Well, either they, like, go willingly or you, uh, kill them. Any other questions?
Robyn: Sounds chill. I’m, I’m cool with all this. This is all something I’m comfortable with. No questions.
Syd: Sounds dope.
Lilith: Alright. Petua, did you have anything else?
Amanda: No. No, I–I think I’ll just learn by doing at this point.
Lilith: Okay! Okay fantastic. So I’ll send you–send you guys back land of the living-side. Um, I do have [pause] a contact for you. Umm, he’s a bit eccentric, but he’s gonna be…. Well, I’d say he’s gonna be your wheelman, but I’m pretty sure he doesn’t actually know how to drive, but he has a car! Name’s Mikey uhhh, and I’ll kinda just let ya’ll, uh, figure–figure out the rest of it. You’ll be meeting him outside of the town of your first mission, which is going to take place in, uh, in a little city called Poulton, Texas.
Something’s going on in Poulton, Texas. Somebody–Somebody died under mysterious circumstances and ever since then we have–I’ve been seeing a lot of people die, very specifically, in very, in very mysterious ways. So it’s been… a little fucked up. Yeah. Y’all go and figure it out.
And she kinda, shh, shooes you away.
The three of you, you’re hanging out at a rest stop in west Texas. A Winnebago pulls up in front of you, and, uh, I’m gonna let the driver of that Winnebago take over for a second.
Cassidy: So, when she says a Winnebago pulls up, what she actually means is a Winnebago screeches to a halt [brakes screeching sound] 5 feet in front of you in a cloud of gravel. The passenger side door opens and probably one of the strangest people you’ve ever seen gets out of it. Not strange so much in appearance, his actual appearance is fairly mundane, you can just imagine a very heavily bearded, long haired, kind of. Just like a hobo lookin’ motherfucker, to be honest. Oh, what’s the, is this podcast going to be rated PG? Can I swear? Do I have to worry about that?
Lilith: Oh, this podcast is rated like, R. R. NC-17, like
Cassidy: OK, ’cause like.
Lilith: There’s like–
Cassidy: Like I swear a lot, and I make a lot of jokes about sucking dick and like stuff like that.
Lilith: There’s actual dicks in Ghostpuncher, like already.
Cassidy: Well I know that.
Lilith: There’s like full frontal male demonic nudity, so like.
Cassidy: So this person, this weird hobo looking motherfucker. Very obviously wearing clothes that aren’t his. He’s got kind of a plaid button down shirt, untucked but with the sleeves rolled up probably 8 or 9 times. Also wearing khakis, no shoes, also rolled up very heavily. Clearly the clothes are intended for a much larger person, and this guy’s maybe 5″ 9′ at best. He’s sort of walks up to you. His body language is the biggest thing that you notice about him, it’s very furtive, almost animal-like. He kinda looks you over, then just kinda grunts, motions towards the RV, and then walks back into it.
Syd: Twisted.
Amanda: I think [pause] this might be our ride.
Robyn: I like it. I like this whole situation.
Amanda: Really? This really doing it for you? This is your thing?
Robyn: Oh, this is very cool.
Amanda: Alright. What about you? I nod to Elektra.
Syd: Elektra’s already boarded.
Robyn: Oh! Well
[Lilith laughs]
Amanda: Well
Robyn: And see that was very quick. Like a shadow.
Syd: Yeah.
Amanda: Darting to the Winnebago. Alright, Petua kind of just, I guess, hops on in the winnebago as well, Why not?
Robyn: I follow.
Lilith: Alright
Robyn: Kevin follows, not me.
Cassidy: So you find, you find Mikey, just kind of sitting, or–who you presume Mikey to be, kinda just sitting in the driver’s seat of the Winnebago, hands on the wheel, 2 and 10, staring straight off ahead into space.
Amanda: I tap him on the shoulder
Cassidy: He turns and looks at you and just says “I don’t know where we’re supposed to be going. So. If you do know. Maybe you should drive.”
Lilith: Lucifer gave you three spots that you can visit in Poulton that she knew of would be possible points of interest. One is a custom car shop where that mysterious death happened, that you don’t really know much else about. One is the house of one of the late victims, his wife lives there, her name is Samantha Timmons. And the other one is the Poulton Independence Garrison Police Department.
Amanda: Fuck cops, alright, not doing that.
Robyn: Yeah, fuck cops.
Syd: Fuck cops
Robyn: I think we should go to the.. Oop?
Amanda: Alright, well, first of all, our drive ju–our driver just told us that he can’t drive, so I think we sh–
Cassidy: I didn’t say I can’t drive, I just don’t know where we’re going.
Amanda: Ah right
Robyn: Wow that’s a really rude assumption to make.
Amanda: I’m sorry. I just, I interpret these things. I think petua pulls out like a black moleskine notebook that has written down the names of the various locations. How does everybody feel about the house situation? I’m really not feeling the police station.
Syd: Is that where someon–
Cassidy: I don’t know what you’re talking about. Mikey just is staring at you blankly.
Robyn: Hey, hey Mikey whassup? There’s these three places we can go to I guess? And that’s uh, a house, the cops, we can go the cops, or we can go to a car shop, which I personally like ’cause I know about those.
Mikey: I don’t know what any of those things are.
Robyn: Oh.
Amanda: Interesting. I think somebody… So you definitely can drive–
Cassidy: Oh yeah! I’ve been doing this for a little while now, I think I’ve gotten the hang of it. I’ve had this thing for a couple weeks.
Amanda: Alright.
Robyn: That’s how long it took me to learn how to drive, so. I’m, I’m comfortable with this.
Amanda: I mean the way today’s going? Why not? Alright, I think the car shop sounds just fine.
Syd: Elektra during this conversation was a little bit distracted, not paying attention. She was like, setting down her gear and taking the sleeves off of her jacket.
Cassidy: Is that like a zip or like a button kind of thing?
Syd: It’s a zip.
Amanda: Or just rip–oh I just thought you were ripping them off, okay.
Syd: It’s like a jacket and the sleeves zip off.
Cassidy: Because I feel like Elektra is so advanced in the cyberpunk fashion game that those sleeves might even be magnetic.
Syd: Oooh, yeah.
Lilith: Okay! So you pull up to this um, car shop. You see Jackie’s Customs in a big red sign outside. It’s in kind of a warehouse kinda looking building. Umm, and there is a double doors in the front
Amanda: Now this is making the assumption that we got here in one piece.
Lilith: Yeah!
Cassidy: Well Mikey’s driving style is very much all gas and all brakes.
[Syd laughs]
Robyn: At some point I told Mikey that he should only be using one foot.
[Laughing]
Cassidy: I mean, yeah. There’s two pedals. Just makes sense that you’d use two feet.
Robyn: It does!
Amanda: It does. And now that we’ve decided that I think we should check out the car shop, so I suppose that we pile out, maybe a little worse for wear but umm. Look. Mikey.
Cassidy: Yes?
Amanda: We’re going to go in there for. For a while.
Cassidy: Ok.
Amanda: And, um, you should stay in the car.
Robyn: I like that idea.
Amanda: But the car should not be moving.
Cassidy: Okay. I might not be in here, I don’t like being in here. I might be on top of it.
Amanda: Alright. That is perfectly fine. Somewhere adjacent to the car.
Cassidy: As soon as you’re done saying that, Mikey literally climbs out the open window like up on to the roof of the cab.
Amanda: Right. Well.
Robyn: Alright
Syd: Elektra’s just shaking her head, says wow. Nodding her head, not shaking her head. It’s more of an approval “wow”.
Also I gather up my gear and sling it over my back. Which, by the way. I haven’t really described that. It’s like a moderately sized portable amp. It’s definitely like something kinda hold up like it was mounted on my arm, but it’s like, think like the keyboard that I have, that you’ve seen in pictures, and then like imagine if synths were just embedded in that top portion.
Cassidy: Mmkay.
Lilith: I like it. Cool.
Amanda: The best part about this is that you’re not even, like, bringing a knife to a gun fight, you’re bringing a synth to a demon fight. So.
Syd: Well, I also have a bat.
Amanda: Oh, good. Alright.
Syd: Yeah. If I need to.
Amanda: Alright.
Robyn: I have a sword that I bought at the mall.
[Laughing]
Robyn: And I have a, I also have like a brown messenger bag, the contents of which I will not share with anybody.
Amanda: I mean, according to my character sheet I have a rapier and crossbow but I’m realizing that that is probably kind of goofy given my character, but we’ll roll with it for now. So we’re kinda armed to the teeth here, I guess we should go into the car shop.
Lilith: Okay! You walk in. You see just kind of a, it’s kind of a lobby sales area. There are people in really ugly polo shirts talking to customers and there is a, kind of a desk at the end of the room. Behind which you can see a couple people who are just kinda chatting. Behind the desk there is a door and to the right of the desk there is a set of double glass doors.
Amanda: I look at the, uh, my two new friends and I kind of talk out of the corner– Should we go up? Should we go talk to them?
Syd: I raise my eyebrows and shrug and say “Sure?”
Robyn: Yeah, um, I know how to talk to these guys.
Amanda: Oh, good. Thank god. Alright, you do it, please. For the love of god.
Robyn: Oh, so what are we trying to find out again?
Amanda: Anything?
Robyn: About the, the, was it a murder for sure or was it a disappearance?
Lilith: There was a mysterious death here.
Robyn: Okay. Here. Okay, cool. Yeah, I got this. I got this.
Amanda: Just make sure that you use good, uh, bedside manner, or whatever? I mean it might still be a sensitive topic.
Robyn: Oh yeah! Of course.
Lilith: Uhhh, hey, hey what’s up uh welcome to Jackie’s Customs. We can help you out, what are you lookin for? I saw you pulled up in a sick Winnebago.
Robyn: Oh, thanks. It’s a pretty sick Winnebago. I was just wondering, I heard someone died here?
Lilith: Uhhhh yeah uhhhhhhh and he’s just like
Robyn: Hey it’s chill, I’m a mechanic, too.
Lilith: Uhhh and the guy who he was talking to, who looks quite a bit older walks up and he’s “Uhh hey, do you need something? Did you want to purchase something?”
Robyn: Yeah, I’ve been looking for… um… Oh man, this, I just realized I don’t actually know about… My character knows about cars, so he says like a legit car thing.
[Laughing]
Robyn: He says like a real car thing
Cassidy: This is great, ’cause this is like the exact group of people who cannot even help you in this situation.
Amanda: We don’t know anything about cars.
Cassidy: It’s not like I can bail you out and be like, “Oh, you’re looking for” yeah, I dunno.
Robyn: He’s like, I need, uh, he’s like, Yeah well I’ve been shoppin around for, uh, some wires.” But like he knows what kind of wires he’s looking for
[laughing]
Cassidy: Cars have wires in them, right?
Robyn: Yeah, they totally do, I’ve seen them.
Lilith: Okay! Yeah man, we’ve got a little bit of wiring in the, uh, in our audio department. We’ve got some stuff going on.
Robyn: Oh yeah
Lilith: Uhh, we’re mostly kind of a superficial mods. We don’t get under the hood a whole lot. Kinda just the fun stuff.
Robyn: Oh! Yeah. Okay. I make a note in my mind that that is suspicious.
Cassidy: Body shops are suspicious?
Robyn: Yes.
Cassidy: Fair. Fair.
Amanda: Even in 2015’s economy spending money on your car is definitely suspicious.
Robyn: Seems like a front to me.
Amanda: i would say so.
Robyn: I might be wrong, but to Kevin it seems like a front.
Amanda: Alright.
Robyn: But, um, I follow him to look at the stereo equipment.
Lilith: Uhh, you follow him through those double glass doors into a room.
Robyn: Double glass doors.
Lilith: Yeah. Into a room that is lined with 200, if any of you are really fast at counting, speakers just kinda lining the room.
[Styleize by Stab Something fades in]
Sydney: I am really into it. I am, in my mind I am wondering how easily I could just plug my shit into whatever PA system and just..
Lilith: it actually kinda seems like a lost of them are set up to like different like recievers? And just every- like there’s people just kind of milling around.
Sydney: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
Lilith: Turning on and playing with the radios and switching everything around. It sounds like–it sounds like a horrible horrible nightmare Best Buy.
Sydney: Yeah.
Robyn: So like a normal Best Buy.
Lilith: Yeah
Amanda: Yeah, yeah.
Lilith: Yeah.
Robyn: Okay.
Lilith: There goes that sponsorship! Thank you Robyn.
Robyn: Aw! I’m sorry.
Lilith: Gah!
Robyn: Famous podcast sponsor, Best Buy. Can’t to a listen to an episode of Serial without a Best Buy ad.
[laughter]
Robyn: Um. Oh man, so.
Lilith: The clerk’s just like, so yeah we got wires, we got stereos.
Robyn: Yeah, yeah. So i’m like. I’m pretending to be interested in the uh, the steroes and pretending I’m shopping. And is this the same guy I talked to earlier, Im, I’m sorry for getting this confused. Is this the guy I brought the murder up to or is this his, um, superior?
Lilith: This is just, this is just the clerk. The superior stayed, stayed back, but he seems to be keeping an eye on you through the glass doors.
Robyn: I can see how he would do that.
Amanda: Can I– Go ahead
Robyn: Oh, no. You go ahead. ‘Cause I have nothing.
Amanda: Can I roll an investigation check? To see if there’s anything suspicious about the way that he’s acting?
Lilith: Absolutely you can.
Amanda: Hey guys! It’s the first, it’s the first roll of the game!
Sydney: Woo! Bwaaaah!
Robyn: Woo.
Amanda: Let’s make it a good one!
Cassidy: Is this the role in role playing?
Sydney: I think so.
Lilith: Yes
Amanda: No, that’s actually, we’re going to bake some delicious brioche buns and that’s the rolls in our role playing.
Robyn: Oh, good.
Amanda: And it’s a, oh, oh, great. It’s a four. Um.
Cassidy: Seems legit.
Lilith: I mean–
Amanda: Nowhere to go but up.
Lilith: So, so he, uh, he seems like he’s on the level. Uh, just completely not suspicious whatsoever. Doesn’t seem like evasive about anything at all, or like nervous about some of the questions that Kevin was, was asking about.
Amanda: I– [laughter]
Cassidy: See this is where you get one of those classic pitfalls of D&D is that you know that you did a bad job, but your character doesn’t necessarily know that you did a bad job.
Amanda: Well I also think it’s hilarious that instead of just saying that I don’t notice anything about him that we went all the way circumspect and said that he’s just a great fucking dude. Which is technically also noticing something, so I guess four gets you a good way in this world. So I kinda nod at him through the glass, maybe a little awkwardly, give him a little wave ’cause he’s, he’s my new friend. So uh that’s something. Alright, anyone else wanna try some shit?
Robyn: Umm. Can I..? Again, yeah, first time playing D&D. Is there some kind of role I can do for like charisma, like a conversation roll?
Lilith: Oh! Yeah, I mean you can maybe like, ummm. Just, like, I want you to kinda, y’know, improv through the conversation and like tell me–
Robyn: Yeah, improv through it
Lilith: Yeah, yeah.
Robyn: Cool cool. So I uhh. We’ve been talking about speakers for about 5 minutes, I feel like, y’know he’s pretty, he thinks I’m just a speakers-looking person at this point. And then I say, Yeah! So I heard some weird stuff, I heard some weird stuff’s been going on, do you know anything about that, dude?
Lilith: Can you–can you roll me a persuasion check.
Robyn: Yeah!
Lilith: So just roll d20, add your persuasion modifier?
Robyn: D20. Uh, that is a solid 9.
Lilith: Uhh, I probably shouldn’t be telling you this, man, but uh yeah like one of my coworkers, couple weeks ago, umm like, something messed up happened to him back in the stock room. Umm, really shouldn’t, shouldn’t be talking about it but yeah, there was something going on.
Amanda: Alright. I walk up to him.
Lilith: Ohh, hey what’s up.
Amanda: Hi, look, I’m…. Um… I promise we won’t get you into any trouble here, completely confidential–
Lilith: Yall need some weed?
Amanda: Um… Listen I–. If, if, you–
Lilith: I’ve got weed!
Amanda: Petua just… Im… I’m sure that you do. And that is wonderful. But we can really only enjoy it after, after we understand what’s going on. There’s no way that we could possibly relax until we get this information so if you could please, I mean really. Trust me. We are as they say “on the level”. Completely.
Lilith: Okay, I want you to roll another persuasion check.
Amanda: Oh good, I was hoping you would ask me to do that ’cause I have proficiency. OHH! Alright, so that’s sixteen plus, so I add my modifier and my proficiency bonus, that’s sixteen plus five, that’s twenty-one.
Lilith: Alright! Okay, okay. Just, you gotta be super chill about this, and about the weed. Um, but like, this dude. It’s actually kinda funny, I was here on the… He got crushed by a shipment of truck nuts.
Amanda: Of…
Robyn: Oh.
Amanda: Wait, so you mean the screws that connect car parts together?
Lilith: No, you know like the little rubber, like, the things you hang off of the–we sell them, I could actually just uh… I could go grab a pair.
Cassidy: See, at this point I need to correct [Lilith] ’cause Truck Nut brand Truck Nutz are actually not rubber, they’re actually made of metal. I know this because I’m from Alberta. Just, like, I need to correct the inaccuracies in this universe.
Lilith: There are definitely rubber truck nuts, I…
Cassidy: Not truck nut brand truck nuts.
Lilith: Okay, well they have not, they haven’t paid for any product placement on the show so fuck ’em.
Sydney: Truck. It’s… It’s truck nadz.
Amanda: At this point Petua thinks that they’re screws so let’s move this along ’cause I wanna see what happens.
Lilith: Okay. Uh, so. So you really, okay. Uh. He, he like pops over–there’s a door that says employees only. He uh pushes it open, disappears for a few seconds and comes back with uhh, a, a… lovely, I’m sure, they’re definitely uneven the way all of them are, umm. But just a pair, a pair of rubber testicles for your truck. And he’s just kinda holdin’ em up.
Amanda: Petua kindof. Yes. I see.
Sydney: So, during most of the conversation Elektra’s just kindof like hovering over by audio equipment, kinda like lookin it over. She gets really aloof at times. Umm, she wanders back to the party just as this is occurring and then turns back around and goes back.
[Laughter]
Amanda: Great, great. Um. Those are definitely truck nuts. There was a whole box of them and it was on the–on site in the back room you say?
Lilith: It was on the shelf, he was trying to get it down. We were stockin’ the nuts, you know? And uhh, somethin’ just slipped and uh, yeah. He was. Eugh. It was pretty brutal, actually when the whole thing went down.
Amanda: Well I’m sure it is, but that doesn’t seem like something that you should be concealing. Wasn’t there an investigation after it happened?
Lilith: Well, yeah, like there was like, y’know, police and all that kindof stuff but uhh we’re really uhh my boss has said we’re not s’posed to talk about it. And, uh, the, the superior, the guy uhmmm, the guy in the other room. He, he’s kinda, he sees that uhm that his employee is holding a pair of nuts in his hand and he’s uhh. He opened up the, the, those double glass doors and he’s walkin’ over towards y’all.
Uhh, hey, hey! You, uh, you guys interested in buying uhh, buying some speakers, buying some, some.. um… novelty accessories?
Amanda: We were actually just marvelling at the novelty of this accessory. It really is something else, and this young man, uh.. What was your name again?
Lilith: Uhh, I’m uh, I’m Clark.
Amanda: Clark, of course, how could I forget? Clark was, uh, just really–if there’s a survey that we can fill out when we leave, his customer service. Absolutely fantastic. Really could not speak highly enough. I probably will buy a lot them.
Lilith: A lot of…
Robyn: He really. The truck nuts. He really sold us on these truck nuts.
Lilith: Okay, well fantastic. Uhm. Clark, you know to do the bulk order forms, right? And Clark says, Yeah, yeah man. I got it, I got it. I’ll take care of it, uhh thanks though. And the manager walks back to his station.
Robyn: I whisper–Do we have enough money for an entire bulk order of truck nuts?
Amanda: I mean, if–if–if, if a bulk order of truck nuts is a murder weapon it might be useful to have them.
Robyn: Okay? I yield to you on this.
Lilith: I just wanna be real clear we don’t have the nuts that he died from, we just–Oh my god, what? Do you want those nuts? I–uhh, I’m pretty sure–
Amanda: Yes.
Robyn: Was I whispering that loud?
Lilith: Uhh, they’re–
Amanda: I do want those nuts.
[laughter]
Lilith: Uhh, I think the police have that, yeah. ‘Cause it’s like, evidence? Of like, like a murder? Or, not a murder, a death?
Amanda: Yes. You said murder though, was that like a freudian slip? Like do you think that there was something suspicious?
Lilith: Well they were obviously investigating it, but uh no they never found anything. ‘Cept just a whole lotta nuts.
Amanda: Yes. I–Okay. I think that me and my associates should confer over there about the nuts. So if you’ll excuse us.
Robyn: We’re gonna figure out if we want that many nuts.
Lilith: Alright, sounds good. Uhm, I’ll, uh. Honestly? You know what? I don’t actually know how to do the bulk orders so I’m just gonna, uh, pull that system up on my computer and I’ll, uh, I’ll be right back. He, he wanders over back to his desk.
Sydney: [whispering] Why are we buying a bulk order of truck nuts?
Amanda: Well, if you had been over here helping with your speaker knowledge maybe we wouldn’t have to buy a bulk order of truck nuts.
Robyn: Well we haven’t bought them yet, we can just leave if we want to. I don’t know–
Sydney: Yeah, is there any other information we need ’cause we could totally just leave.
Robyn: I think we should just leave.
Amanda: Well, wait a minute, wait a minute. What about this, this. I mean, he said the box killed him, I guess that’s probably standard protocol. Do you think that we should poke around? I don’t know. I don’t even know what you two do can you smell whatever’s going on here? I’m not sure.
Sydney: Mmm.. Nn… No.
Robyn: Umm.. Maybe? I may be able– So I just realized, hey hey, first time D&D player here?
Lilith: Yeah.
Robyn: Just realized I, when I made my character sheet, I forgot to like assign, um, skills, and I just did that.
Lilith: Oh! That’s like super important ’cause you’re a rogue.
Robyn: Yeah! Yeah it’s super important. Uhm… Let’s see if we can’t, um… Go sneak through that other door we saw.
Lilith: Okay, so you’re gonna, you’re gonna try to go through the door that says employees only?
Robyn: Yeah!
[I’ll Handle It – combatplayer fades in]
Lilith: Alright! Then Robyn, I’m gonna need you to roll two checks for me, one stealth check to make sure you don’t get caught doing this, and one thieves tools check
Robyn: Okay. Are those both, uh, 20 sided?
Lilith: Yeah, yeah.
Robyn: Cool. Uhh, I got an 18 for the stealth check.
Lilith: Alright
Amanda: Oh shit!
Robyn: And a 14 for the Thieves Tools.
Lilith: Okay. Oh! So, you were not able to get through that door.
[Music cuts]
Robyn: Oh no!
Lilith: Yeah.
Robyn: Well, no one saw me do it, right?
Lilith: Yeah, no one saw you do it! So.
Robyn: So I just whistle, and I walk back to the group. Hey guys, I couldn’t get in. Sorry. I’m usually better at this stuff.
Sydney: What happened to the shipment that fell on him? I’m guessing the police took it?
Robyn: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah, he said that the police took it. Well, we could always talk to the manager again and maybe find out, not necessarily maybe about the person who died? I mean it seems like this was an accidental death and usually if an accidental death happens it’s the person who was killed, they’re trying to disguise the fact that they wanted to be, y’know, wanted to get them killed. So maybe we should see who the person was that got killed. Find out maybe more about them.
Lilith: Real quick, just one other thing, there is a–there’s three doors going out from the room that you’re currently in. One of them says employees only, the other one is the uh double doors back to the uh the sales area, and another one is a door that just says customs on it.
Amanda: Alright, let’s just go through the other door, fuck this.
Sydney: Yeah I wanna check out that customs.
Amanda: Yeah let’s go through there.
Lilith: You go through the door, there’s a bunch of, y’know, salesmen, customers, just kinda sales people running around, umm but this room is just lined with like, fuckin neon lights and like spinning rims and just like all the cool shit that you can put on a car. Body kits.
Amanda: Cool shit.
Lilith: Paint
Sydney: Truck nuts
Lilith: I mean, they keep those in the back, but yeah.
Amanda: Alright
Cassidy: You don’t wanna keep a hot ticket item like that out where people can steal it easily.
Amanda: No
Robyn: It’s like in a video store where there’s a curtain and it says adults only.
Cassidy: No no no, I think it’s–I think it’s like a glass display case sort of affair. Like if you wanna see it you have to hand over your ID.
Amanda: Oh my god. Can I roll a perception check?
Lilith: Yeah, yeah roll a perception check for me.
Amanda: And that was an… 20.
Lilith: 20! The one thing you definitely notice, and you’re not sure if this is just like maybe like there’s maybe like a draft in the room or something like that, the spinning rims seem to be turning a lot more than say they normally would since they’re just mounted stationary on the wall.
Amanda: Alright… That’s weird enough that I would also like to make an arcana check.
Lilith: Okay! Yeah, go ahead.
Amanda: Alright! I’m going to check out all of that. Ooh, well that’s not quite as good, let’s see… Uhh, 14?
Lilith: You’re definitely feeling some energy from those rims. There’s–there’s something, there’s somethin’ weird going on there but you don’t know what.
Amanda: Alright. I kick Kevin in the shin and I say hey. You know about cars, are those supposed to be doing that?
Robyn: Iuuhhh, My guess would be that they got robot, it’s like a, it’s like a–what an animatronic they got ’em spinnin. But you said there’s magic?
Amanda: I mean, I’m definitely, I don’t really–magic is not my favorite word. I really think that there’s–there must be something um… otherworldly about them.
Sydney: I just wanna say that Elektra definitely came over to them when she saw Petua kick Kevin.
[laughter]
Robyn: I was, it turns out I’m very dumb and I zoned out. What–so, I just, I don’t know nothing ’bout magic cars. I know about regular cars.
Sydney: I could take a closer look
Amanda: yeah, Elektra, why don’t you check it out?
Sydney: Electronics and magic, that’s my thing! And then I crack my knuckles and I go check it out, uh… I’m gonna do an investigation or arcana–
Lilith: Uhh, roll me an arcana check.
Sydney: That is an 18.
Lilith: An 18? Uhmmm.
Sydney: Yeah
Lilith: Just ’cause you got a little bit closer you don’t necessarily notice anything umm, further but you can feel like almost feels like uhh uhh, some sort of aural heat coming off of these spinning rims.
Sydney: An aural heat?
Lilith: Yeah, like it’s, you just feel vibes emanating.
Cassidy: That’s like aural as in aura, not like oral as in sound.
Lilith: Yeah, they aren’t like blowing hot wind at you, um. That’s definitely the wrong image.
Sydney: Can I tell if there’s any kind of motor there?
Lilith: You definitely don’t hear any kind of motor, any kind of anything like that.
Sydney: Sss…. I’m definitely feeling somthing weird over here y’all. I’m not sure.
Lilith: As y’all start to kinda, you’re talking out loud about the rims you’re noticing that they’re kind of slowing down and that aura seems to be fading a little bit.
Amanda: Whatever it is I think it knows that we’re here.
Sydney: Can I feel a direct–can I feel like one side felt less quicker than the other, like it went left or it went right or something like that?
Lilith: Mmm, no, no it just kind of receded.
Sydney: Wait, it’s gone?
Lilith: It’s, it’s receding. It’s not entirely gone.
Sydney: I felt something, but it’s…. Cooler now? Not necessarily less warm but there was something.
Robyn: You think it can hear us talking about it?
Lilith: In this room there’s the door you just came through, there is another door marked employees only, and then there’s another door marked self defense.
Amanda: Oh, well fuck this. We should definitely go check that out.
Robyn: Self defense? What? Car places aren’t supposed to have self defense rooms. I know that much.
Sydney: Huh. Um… Shall we?
Robyn: Let’s do it.
Amanda: I think we shall. We go to the self defense room.
Lilith: Okay, and in the–The self defense room is a lot smaller than the customs room and the audio room, umm but you, you see umm, a number of–some of them are just like, y’know uh fancy car alarms, lo-jacks, things like that. Uhm, motion activated shotguns, uhm
Amanda: I forgot we were in texas.
Lilith: Spiked tires. There’s actually just a wall of guns. Uhm, all of which are secured down with locks. Uhm, there’s a cannon in the room and you don’t know why.
Robyn: Like a pirate cannon?
[laughter]
Sydney: Yeah.
Robyn: But like.. I’m picturing like a pirate, like a flat out cannon.
Lilith: Uhh, I was gonna go more civil war era, but yeah, you got the idea.
Robyn: Okay, okay. Cool.
Sydney: Sorry, the wall where the rims were, is that adjacent to this room?
Lilith: ah, no. That wall was actually facing towards the employees only room, it seems like that, the stock room.
Sydney: Yeah, I just kinda get my bearings and realize where we are in relation, and I say: This is interesting, but I think we should try to check out that stock room.
Amanda: Yeah. I think–
Robyn: I agree.
Amanda: Alright, um, can we just uh really quick talk about the fact that they needed to get a guy to show us truck nuts but there’s nobody in the room that is full of weapons.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah, you’re actually, there’s a number of customers in this room but you seem to be completely unsupervised by any personell who works here.
Robyn: Do we want to take anything? Or is that too risky.
Cassidy: I feel like stealing guns and then dying in a police shootout is gonna make this campaign really short. So.
Amanda: Yeah, I was about to say.
Sydney: But bad ass.
Amanda: Whatever. Yeah, alright. Let’s go, here’s the thing. I think that we should talk to the manager, unless you wanna try to break into the employees only–does anybody have a way to pick a lock?
Robyn: I, um, yeah I’m a rogue. But I failed that check earlier.
Amanda: Well here’s the thing; it’s a different door this time.
Robyn: That’s true.
Amanda: Alright, do your–Kevin, do your thing.
Robyn: Gonna do my thing.
Amanda: We’ll cover you
Robyn: Cool.
Lilith: Alright, roll me another thieves tool check on this door.
Robyn: Will do. Is, are there any modifiers that I apply?
Lilith: Yeah, yeah. I think it’s a dexterity and I’d imagine as a rogue you should have, like, proficiency in thieves tools.
Robyn: Yeah. Like I said, I live my life on the seat of my pants, I saw a bunch of words and numbers, I got panicked and I treated it like an essay, or something that I had to write and I waited till the last day.
Lilith: That’s totally chill, I think everyone except for Syd actually got their character sheets in the last like, 24 hours, so that’s like.
Cassidy: I did mine yesterday.
Lilith: Cassidy, bullshit, I had to wake you up today to do yours.
Cassidy: Did I? I thought I did mine last night, no you’re right I did do it this morning. You’re right.
Robyn: Okay, okay. I figured it out. So I rolled a 19 then plus one so that’s–
Lilith: Okay! So the door, uh, pops open and it opens up and it’s actually. You actually opened up the one, the door that goes to the garages. You see like lifters for cars, lotta, just some dudes like walking around, working on stuff. They don’t really seem to pay you much mind. Um. ‘Cause you look like a mechanic.
Robyn: Yeah.
Lilith: Uh, But yeah. You’re just in a busy garage right now.
Robyn: Cool, cool. I don’t know nothin’ about this magic I’m lookin’ for. Uh huh. But I could do–should I invite people who know about magic in here?
Amanda: Who wants me to roll an arcana check? ‘Cause I really want to.
Lilith: Oh, go ahead. Roll that arcana check.
Robyn: I would love that.
Lilith: I assume you’ve, you’re kinda peering through the doorway.
Cassidy: And through the veils.
Amanda: Yeah, I’m acting super natural. As if was born to hear, yeah. Ooh! Well, alright. Plus…. Hold on…. Oh wait, it’s actually plus 4 so 15.
Lilith: Fifteen? Okay, I’m just gonna tell you you did pass that check, but uh there’s… There’s… jack di–I mean, look, there’s Credence on the radio. And that’s like, you’re feeling a little bit of magic.
[Cross talk]
Lilith: But uh, other than that just completely devoid of magic.
Cassidy: Is there a bad moon rising though? What do I roll to find that out?
[Fortunate Son by Credence Clearwater Revival MIDI VERSION fades in]
Lilith: Well it’s like three in the afternoon, so, uh, no.
Cassidy: That was a really stupid joke that no one laughed at.
[laughter]
Robyn: I was genuinely curious, maybe there was a bad moon rising.
Amanda: Nice. Alright, I guess I look at Kevin and I say, “I think this might be normal for–Elektra, you said you thought it went in here?”
Sydney: I couldn’t be certain, it receded or moved away or something. But this is an–
Lilith: From what y’all can see like the garage seems to end before, like, where the sound room was. Yeah. Yeah there’s another door at the end of the garage that just, it says stock room on it.
Robyn: Let’s check out that stock room!
Amanda: I think so too.
Sydney: Let’s sneak into that stock room.
Lilith: Yeah I’m gonna need–I’m gonna need three stealth checks.
Sydney: Okay.
Amanda: Oh that’s not bad.
Sydney: That is a seven.
Amanda: It’s a fifteen.
Lilith: Okay.
Robyn: Uhh, a twenty.
Lilith: Okay, so uh. I–here’s the thing. I know most of y’all did perfectly well but Elektra sticks out like a sore thumb. And
[Music cuts out with static]
[laughter]
Robyn: That’s true. That’s very true.
Sydney: I walked into the wrong room. Whoopsie-doodle.
Lilith: Everyone’s just kinda looking, now at the three of you because y’know, Elektra kinda called over attention. Hey! Hey what are ya’ll, uh, what are y’all doing here? And, um, just then the, the manager from before, uh, walks right through that door that y’all just came through and he sees you three and, ah, he knew y’all were up to no good from the very moment he saw you. “Ahh, I think it’s time for you three to go. Uhm, I mean, you can, you can process a bulk order of truck nuts online, Jackiescustoms.com if you want to. But uh, I think your, uh, I think your visit to our store today has, uh, has come to an end. How ’bout that?”
Amanda: Well, I mean, here’s the thing. If you wanna put yourself out of business, uh, that’s fine. But if you go in there you’re gonna find something you don’t like and we were just trying to, y’know, clear it out for you because trust me, we’ve heard some shit–
Lilith: Uhh, the police have already cleared out any kind of questions about that, uhm.
Amanda: Oh! Not about–oh, about what? What do you mean? I wasn’t talking about whatever you’re talking about.
Sydney: Nice save.
Robyn: I have a very high–that was a great save–I have a very high deception skill.
Lilith: Okay!
Robyn: Uhh, if we want me to try to lie to this guy.
Lilith: I mean, here’s the thing. I’m gonna let you do that but you have to tell me what you’re telling to this guy.
Robyn: I ha–I know. Um…. Yeah, I know, I’m trying to think of the perfect lie for this. [laughs] Hey, hey dude. So here’s the thing. These are my friends, uh, they look, I know they dress weird, it’s whatever. Uhm. I’m, I’m from I’m from ke–I’m Kevin. I’m, I’m from Kevin’s garage?
Liith: Oh! Oh yeah kevin’s garage, I know kevin’s garage.
Robyn: Ke–Yeah, I’m from kevin’s garage. I’m not the Kevin. It’s just a coincidence. But i–
Lilith: No, yeah, I know Kevin, I know you’re not that Kevin. We’re good.
Robyn: Yeah, uhm. Someone, uhm, not you, I don’t think, I think it was someone beneath you but they called me in for backup, I heard you guys had some rats in the stockroom. And instead of calling an exterminator.
[laughter]
Amanda: Keep it in the family.
Robyn: They want to keep it in the family, my specialty is kinda, y’know, rat-stomping, so I’m just here to stomp the rats in the stock room.
Lilith: Okay, roll that deception check for me.
[laughter]
Robyn: Absolutely. Uhh, that’s, that’s a seventeen.
Lilith: Ohh my god. Yeah, okay, thank god you’re here. Uh, those rats are uh they, they’re getting into all of our, uhm, we got some, uh, some some uh… edible ball bearings? Uhh, what do you call, you put em on cakes?
Amanda: Pop rocks?
Robyn: Oh, I know exactly what you’re talking about. Uhm, they’re called, they have like a, it’s like a french name–
Lilith: Dragée, I believe it’s dragées. Anyway, we had a shipment of those because we thought we could put them into wheels and they would make them go faster, uhm, but they just got really sticky and uhh attracted some rats.
Robyn: I’ve tried that.
Lilith: So, um. You go ahead and stomp some rats. Rats. Uhm. What are your friends doing here?
[laughter]
Robyn: Ah, they’re so good at rat stomping.
Amanda: We are so good. At it.
Lilith: Alright!
Robyn: The best, yeah.
Sydney:I lure them out with a song.
Lilith: Thats really interesting.
Sydney: Like the pied piper.
Robyn: Y’know about the pied piper from the story?
Amanda: You don’t want PETA on your ass, basically is what we’re saying. So we will just, it will be very humane stomping. With songs involved.
Robyn: Yeah. All the exterminators in the, in the area they have to report to PETA and they always get mad, I don’t know the rule’s like that. But we don’t do that.
Lilith: Yeah, I mean. Look, ah. Ever since those, those crazy environmentalists took over the city council ahh, I this whole town’s gone to shit. I get it. Ahhm. You guys uhm, you guys go stomp some rats and and uh, and godspeed. Uhh, godspeed. And he walks away.
Amanda: Oh. Sheezus. So glad that the three of us versus door really went successfully after like an hour and a half.
Robyn: Fucking killed that door.
Lilith: Oh and he, he, he, he actually walks over and he unlocks that, uh, that door that says employees only. Uhm. You, you uh, just uh just let us know when you’re done with the rats.
Amanda: Oh we will.
Robyn: Will do.
Sydney: Thank you.
Robyn: So I get, uh, I’m gonna go in there. What I”m gonna do.
Sydney: Me too.
Lilith: Alright, you pop in the stock room and, uhhh, and you see just kinda shelves uhh, there’s like four lines of shelves ahh just with various boxes and uhh and all that kinda shit around. Uhm and you see there’s a, there’s a corner over in the other side of the room that ahh, just kinda seems to be taped off with some uh yellow caution tape.
Amanda: Well let’s check that shit out. Right? The caution tape?
Robyn: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah, alright, let me roll an investigation check–
Lilith: Please do
Amanda: On that area.
[Dice roll sound]
Amanda: Haha! Ha. Ha. Five.
Sydney: Oh!
Lilith: Ahh, the tape is definitely yellow. And it says do not cross.
Amanda: I’m glad that I can read. Good to know. Adding that to my character sheet.
Sydney: I’m trying to, I’m tryna pick back up on any, uh, vibes.
Lilith: Any vibes, alright. Roll me an arcana check.
[Dice roll]
Sydney: That is fifteen.
Lilith: Okay! Uhm, you, you definitely uhm, there’s, there’s… something fucked up happened beyond that caution tape but the, the energy you felt before, it actually, it kind of feels like it’s, like it’s uhm… Like maybe it’s it’s underground at this point.
Sydney: Hmm.
Amanda: If only somebody had detect magic. Probably should’ve thought about that before we went into this… That’s OK.
Sydney: Can I… Try to like, pinpoint, follow it around the room and see if there’s a central point where it feels strongest.
Lilith: I mean, it’s definitely right above, right beyond the caution tape. Uhhm. It seems like it’s, it’s kind of around there.
Sydney: Uhm. I walk over to the caution tape
Lilith: And a rat skitters over your foot.
Sydney: Oh friend.
[laughter]
Sydney: I turn on my amp, greeted a slight buzz. It sounds like a, it’s like a main’s hum, yet it’s not, not plugged in to the wall. Uhm. Turn on my, my synths, which adds a little bit to the hum. Just, just in preparation for anything.
[Amp hum noise, slowly joined by a low rumbling synthesizer]
Lilith: Okay.
Sydney: And notify the others that um, I’m gettin’ some real bad vibes from here man.
Lilith: That kinda, that seems to be all you’re getting is vibes. Uhhhm. Nothing seems to be like comin’ out at you or anything like that.
Sydney: Sure.
Amanda: Uhm.
Sydney: Um. I could do an investigation check. Well. I’d like to investigate further
Lilith: Okay.
Sydney: The, the corner.
[Dice roll]
Sydney: A ten.
Lilith: Okay. You, you, the one, the one extra thing that you definitely see, uhm, is you see a, it looks like definitely somebody tried to wash it but there’s a dark red stain in the, uh, concrete on the ground and–there’s definitely like parts of it you can tell that the blood was pooling around, uhm… N-n-nuts. Like a lotta nuts.
Sydney: Looks like the nuts busted him.
[laughter]
Robyn: Oh god.
Amanda: How long were you sitting on that!?

(untranscribed lyrics)
It’s the fury of the storm
It’s the endless falling rain
It’s the growing of the dark
It’s the thrive of decay
It’s the voice of woe
It’s the call of the moon
It’s the cold retribution

"TRANSCRIPT - EPISODE 2
""Ah, Nuts"" vol II","(Transcription by Micha Cavaseno, contact for transcription work here)
[Music Fades In: Skagos – Blossoms Will Sprout From the Carcass]
Lilith: Hello everyone, Lucifer again. You can call me Luci. Sharp-eared listeners listeners may have noticed that Episode One is about an hour shorter than it was originally. This is the second half of that episode, now being referred to as Episode Two. The numbering of the rest of Ghostpuncher Corps will be shifted in order to accommodate this new episode, and we hope you understand.
Last time we met our three adventurers: the bookish Petua Jones, the cybergoth bard Electra, the ‘oaf’ Kevin along with their mysterious new guide Mikey. In their investigations they left their new friend in the car (which I think was extremely unfair to him), almost bought some bulk order truck nuts, got caught snooping around in Jackie’s Customs, somehow got hired to exterminate some rats and they just didn’t fucking exterminate any of the rats. At all.
Let’s see how things go this time!
[Musical interlude]
Lyrics: We walk upon the soaked carcasses of those who once gave us life.
Amanda: That is not… what a box… does to someone.
Robyn: Well I mean… We don’t know exactly how many truck nuts there were.
Amanda: It’s not-… o-okay, even then. When was the last time you were hit by a blunt object and bled to death?
Robyn: I-i… n-never.
Amanda: Yeah, exactly! I think we should look at I dunno, a coroner’s report or something? There must have been something suspicious about the way that this went down.
Syd: Well you know where we’ll get that…
Amanda: Fuck! Cops! No! Ugh, alright…
Robyn: Well we don’t have to talk to ‘em, we can sneak in.
Amanda: That’s true.
Lilith: Another rat just like, like… crawls across Kevin’s feet. Or Kevin’s shoes.
Robyn: I’m not gonna stop it, cause if we have to come back, I want there to be a reason. I don’t wanna get rid of our lie.
Amanda: Don’t you think that we should kill just like, one rat, so we can show them?
Robyn: Uh, I don’t wanna do it.
Syd: What’s the shelf situation? What do the shelves look like above us?
Lilith: Uh – The shelves? Well actually…
Syd: Where it would’ve fallen from.
Lilith: They’ve all been cleared out. But there is definitely a little sticker there, and it just says ‘nuts, truck’.
Amanda: The name is Nuts. Truck Nuts. Alright, I think we might have exhausted our-
Syd: Sorry.
Amanda: Oh it’s ok… I say in character. To the mic noise that your character just made, I mean you do have a synth so it’s not too far away… I think we should go back to our van friend and let him take us to a second location. I think we’ve exhausted our investigation here until we can find something more about how this went down. What do you think?
Syd: There’s something definitely here though.
Amanda: No I agree, I’m just not sure — Does anybody have any idea of what we could do?
Robyn: I don’t know what we could do —
Syd: Perhaps just the spirit… ?
Robyn: That’s what I was thinking! I’m thinking it might be a poltergeist.
Syd: But I mean of the person that died, maybe.
Robyn: Oh! I don’t know about that stuff.
Amanda: I mean… Let me think. I start pacing a little bit.
Lilith: You hear a voice on the wind, it kinda sounds like Luci, kind of: “Maybe you’ll want to go back here at night or something like that….”
[Dice Roll Noises]
Amanda: Maybe we might wanna come back here at night… or something like that.
Syd: I check the time on my Pebble 2.
Lilith: Oh my god, uhm…
Amanda: Jesus, alright…
Syd: It’s 3 O’Clock right?
Lilith: Yeah it’s around 3.
Amanda: Alright, I think we should go back to our driver and see… Maybe tell them what we saw! Maybe he’ll know something. He seems to know more than either of us know about any kind of weird shit in general.
Robyn: Wait, did you say our driver seems to know more than us?
Amanda: About weird shit? Absolutely.
Robyn: Okay, well, he just seems like some weird shit.
Amanda: … Yeah, you got me there.
Robyn: But yeah, let’s check it out.
Amanda: Alright, let’s go there and at least go to the police station and see what we can do.
Cassidy: Ok so, are y’all leaving the place?
Robyn: Yeah.
Cassidy: Ok so, you find Mikey, sitting on top of the winnebago.
Syd: I give my best fake Texas accent and say “Howdy!”
Cassidy: Like to Mikey?
Syd: Yes.
Cassidy: He just sort of turns and stares at you wordlessly. You notice that he has a tendency to keep his eyes all the way open.
Syd: I nod and I guess I start to start boarding.
Cassidy: Did you find what you’re looking for?
Amanda: We found some rats…
Cassidy: Some ‘what’?
Amanda: Some rats!
Robyn: Rats.
Cassidy: Oh. Did you keep any?
Amanda: No I- Is that your thing?
Cassidy: Oh no I was just a little bit hungry, I was wondering…
Robyn: I could go get one.
Cassidy: No no it’s ok, I can catch my own.
Amanda: Yeah, yeah we’ll keep that in mind. So uh, Mikey–
Cassidy: So what is it y’all were doing here anyway? Like who are you guys?
Amanda: We got, uhm…
Robyn: We know as much as you do.
Cassidy: Oh I don’t know anything, I just got a feeling that I was supposed to show up here at this time. Then I met you guys and you told me to come here.
Amanda: Oh… right. Alright! Mikey! Mikey, ok, we are in communication with something we can’t explain. We can’t see it, but we can feel it.
Cassidy: Ooookay.
Amanda: Did you feel anything? Did you feel anything when you were out here?
Cassidy: Like… I felt a bunch of stuff. Like the wind, and the sunshine. And I heard some birds… and some squirrels.
Syd: What about… [whispered] ghosts?
Cassidy: What? Ghosts? No I didn’t hear any ghosts.
Robyn: Yeah we’re looking for like, ghosts.
Amanda: Essentially.
Robyn: More or Less.
Syd: Maaaaybe.
Cassidy: Oh yeah, I don’t know much about that. I only ever met one ghost. It was weird.
Amanda: Oh!
Robyn: Well oh, hey wait, that’s more… That’s a lot of ghosts, relatively.
Cassidy: Oh I mean like, it was a brief thing. Like it was just the one time.
Robyn: Was it, around here?
Cassidy: Oh nonono. This was like, I dunno, ways ways… that way. He just kind of points vaguely in a direction.
Amanda: Gotcha.
Syd: [unclear inquiry about outside]
Cassidy: Yeah I think we’re just still sitting outside around the winnebago.
Amanda: Yeah, or possibly looking up at him as he sits on the winnebago.
Cassidy: I mean, he’s made no move. You haven’t told him to move or do anything.
Amanda: Right, ok. Mikey, I think we need to go somewhere else now, could you take us there?
Cassidy: Yeah ok, if you tell me where to go.
Amanda: Yeah, cool.
Cassidy: He climbs down from the roof of the roof of the cabin back into the truck. Just kind of like a fluid motion, swinging through the window type thing.
Amanda: Nice.
Syd: So… I’m no fan of cops either but, perhaps if we can convince someone we’re next of kin we can get some information.
Amanda: That sounds like a really good idea.
Robyn: I take my phone out, and use my GPS, and just tell Mikey where to turn and we get there.
Amanda: Good, good.
Lilith: Hell Yeah, Hell Yeah
Cassidy: You notice that as he’s driving he’s constantly glancing over at your phone, kind of confused and non-comprehending. But you get there.
Robyn: Well this is the 7, the iPhone 7, if you had a 6 you might not recognize it.
Cassidy: Hmm, 7. I see. So what was it you were doing anyway?
Amanda: We’re gonna try to to go down to the police station and maybe try and get a report on how the death went down? Because there was way more blood-
Cassidy: What’s a ‘Police Station’?
Amanda: … Oh I thought you were asking out of character, I’m sorry.
Cassidy: Nono, in character.
Amanda: Uhm, we are going to a place, um, where they’re reporting on the death of someone that we are trying to figure out how they died.
Cassidy: Oh. Ok. Did you see their body? That’s the easiest way to see how something’s died. Usually I just look at the body.
Amanda: I know and they took the body away, but there was a lot of blood.
Cassidy: Mmm.
Syd: Well, remnants of blood.
Cassidy: Did he get eaten by a bear? That usually causes a lot of blood.
Amanda: [Nervous chuckle]
Robyn: I mean we can’t rule that out.
Amanda: True!
Cassidy: Remember that ghost I was talking about? He got eaten by a bear. There was a lot of blood.
Amanda: Oh.
Robyn: Did the ghost come out of his body right after? Was it like, in cartoons?
Cassidy: Oh I don’t know, I got there like… days afterwards.
Robyn: Ahhh.
Amanda: Hm.
Robyn: Glad you know what a cartoon is though.
Cassidy: Oh yeah I remember cartoons. I like cartoons. Or, I think I like cartoons. I haven’t seen ‘em in a while.
Amanda: Interesting. But-
Lilith: Okay so
Cassidy: I remember Ninja Turtles. Are there still Ninja Turtles?
Amanda: Alright, this is-
Robyn: Uh, yeah there are.
Lilith: You pull up to the Poulton Independence Garrison Police Department. And you see on the side of all of the patrol cars “P.I.G.P.D”
All: [Laughter]
Lilith: Yeah yeah, thought that’d be good. And yeah, it’s a small little building, double-doors in front. Ample parking. Like that guy said, those environmentalists took over city council and there’s fuckin, there’s like electric car plug-ins…
Amanda: Alright, let’s- Go ahead.
Syd: Oh I break them. Like vandalize them.
Amanda: [Snickers] Alright!
Cassidy: Vandalize how?
Amanda: Do you tie them together?
Syd: Uh… Disable them. If I can. Like just… I don’t know, I don’t know how I’d do that.
Lilith: Uhm, I’m just gonna say you start jamming paper clips into like, electrical like, like…
Syd: Yeah…
Lilith: Yeah, you’re just looking to short something. Uhm, and it seems to be going really well. There’s a really loud pop and hiss and- Actually just, roll me a real quick intelligence check?
Syd: [Rolls]… That’s a five.
Lilith: Oooh! Okay… Well, uhm… Now I want you to roll me a dexterity saving throw.
Amanda: Uh-Oh!
Syd: [Rolls]… Okay… Well, that is, a uh… That is a critical failure.
Amanda: Oh no!
Lilith: Ah jeez.
Cassidy: I don’t think there are critical failures in this game.
Lilith: Yes there are! Yes there are.
Cassidy: Oh.
Amanda: There are… Oh god.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah…
Amanda: You flew too close to the sun.
Lilith: You just–
Syd: I just get–
Lilith: You hear like a Pop! Uhhh, there’s sparks and uhm, you, you just took six electricity damage.
Syd: Ooof. Ooofa-Doofa.
Lilith: Yeah… Yeah you really bonered it on this one, sorry. Uhhh…. Oooh boy.
Amanda: Oh my god.
Lilith: Yeah. Yeah… But it definitely seems to be broken!
Cassidy: Uh, Mikey notices you get electrocuted and runs over to you, Hey are you ok? That looked painful.
Syd: How much was that six… ?
Lilith: Six.
Syd: Y-yeah ah…mmm….
Cassidy: D-don’t get up, don’t get up. I’ll handle it, uhm… Mikey looks at you a second and, just staring at you sort of intently, you know, in a weird way? And for half a second his eyes flash coal black and you gain one D8 hit points, cause I just casted ‘Cure Wounds’.
???: Fuck yeah.
Syd: Ah… Thank you!
Cassidy: Let me actually do the damage roll because I forgot to bring dice. [A Beat] You gained 6 health points back.
Amanda: Oh Nice!
Robyn: Wow. Well that was a fun adventure.
Syd: Thanks, uhm–
Cassidy: Yep, welcome.
Syd: I guess that was… a little unwise of me I guess but you know? Sometimes you…
Cassidy: Oh that’s fine, I remember the first time I got electrocuted it was… yeah. [Indecipherable]
Syd: I mean it felt great, don’t get me wrong… But, ah, thanks!
Amanda: M-… H-How did you do that?
Cassidy: Do what?
Amanda: Well you, you healed her!
Cassidy: Oh yeah, I just like… Y’know? I just, like, fixed… her. With my brain! Y’know, like you do!… Can y’all not do that?
Robyn: That might be a Mickey thing… Mikey thing.
Amanda: That might be a ‘You’ thing.
Cassidy: Oh. Ok cool, I guess that, yeah, that makes sense. I forget sometimes what people can and can’t do.
Syd: Yeah I didn’t even question it because A) still pretty delirious and B) it’s not a far stretch from anything else that I’ve experienced for the past…
Cassidy: While you’re discussing this you notice Mikey messing around with the electrical port that you jammed a paper clip into and electrocuted yourself with.
Lilith: O-Kay, Cassidy, I need you to roll an intelligence check for me.
Amanda: [Laughs]
Cassidy: Nonono, I’m just casting ‘Mending’ on it.
Lilith: OH! Ok. Ok good.
Cassidy: The cantrip. There, now no-one else can get electrocuted. Being electrocuted is awful, I don’t want anyone else to get electrocuted.
Robyn: Well, the people who are here could maybe… use a little bit of electrocuting.
Cassidy: … Oh, ok!
Syd: Let’s stick to the…
Amanda: Yeah yeah, let’s stick to our thing!
Robyn: Ok, fine, fine, we’re already…
Amanda: Alright, before-
Robyn: I’m glad you’re here to- I just, I, it would be cool if we could fuck this shit up. But I understand.
Amanda: Maybe, maybe AFTER we get what we want? How’s that?
Robyn: Ok.
Amanda: But before we do that though, gameplan?
Cassidy: Does anyone hear anything? Mikey’s just kinda looking around.
Amanda: We’re trying to find… Well we’re going to go in there, and try and pretend that we’re uh… We’re gonna try to lie our way in, to getting what we want, basically. It’s about the person who was killed. Uhm, I dunno, do you have any experience with that?
Cassidy: Hmmm. Ok. So you think their body is in there.
Amanda: Well we think pictures of their body might be in there, I don’t know is the morgue in there? I don’t know anything about this actually.
Robyn: I don’t know how police work.
Amanda: It depends on how long ago it happened. No it’s- they probably don’t still have it there, I think. Probably he’s… buried??? I think?
Robyn: We can find out.
Amanda: We can find out! Um, Alright, but, what are we I mean–
Cassidy: Sooo you need to find out then where those pictures are.
Amanda: Yeah… and just anything that’s weird basically so if you get a feeling, let us know.
Cassidy: Ok… Oh do you want me to come in with you, or do you want me to stay out here again?
Amanda: I mean, the way that this day has been going, I think you should come with us.
Cassidy: Oh, ok I can do that.
Amanda: Ok. Oh, are you guys cool with that?
Robyn: Yeah.
Syd: Whatever.
Amanda: Alright, look. We have to have our story straight otherwise we could really fuck this up. Uhm… We could be… journalists? Or…
Robyn: I don’t like that.
Amanda: No…
Robyn: I don’t think they’re gonna be receptive to journalists.
Amanda: Yeah… nobody is. I uh
Cassidy: What’s a journalist?
Robyn: [mumbles]… What is a journalist?
Syd: Depends on who you ask.
Amanda: It depends on who you ask! They ah, they report the news, basically.
Cassidy: They what?
Amanda: They tell people what’s been going on in the world and then they write about it. And people buy it, or listen to it or download it or whatever.
Cassidy: Like write like… You just used a whole bunch of words I don’t know but ok.
Amanda: That’s ok! They tell people what’s up!
Cassidy: I feel like this is one of those questions that’s gonna require a lot more questions.
Amanda: Hm. Well, we can chat about it. I’ll just throw you a newspaper and maybe you can break it down from there. At some point!
Cassidy: Oh oh yeah, Ok, I remember, I know newspapers.
Amanda: Yes.
Robyn: They write the newspapers.
Amanda: They make those.
Robyn: Yeah. Newspap-
Cassidy: What do you mean… they make the newspaper?
Robyn: …er. So there’s this thing called uh, it’s called a ‘printing press’.
Cassidy: Okay.
Robyn: It was invented–
Amanda: Alright we are regressing way back, way back! We cannot get pre-Gutenberg here.
Syd: Steve Guttenberg.
Amanda: No we can’t we can’t. It’s not Steve Guttenberg it super isn’t. Trust me. Trust me. It is not Steve Guttenberg.
Syd: Whatever. Speaking of newspapers, this is character, by the way, in character voice; I’m trying to scrape any like local news outlets that may have reported on this incident to try and find a name.
Lilith: You, okay so there’s-… A name was never reported to the press, but–
Syd: Ok.
Lilith: You actually, you do find… There’s a lot of theories out there. Some people have it right! There’s a couple sites that uhm, that are in a very clickbait-y fashion… “MAN CRUSHED UNDER DILDOS IN POULTON TEXAS”… and a few of the more tasteful outlets who just kind of leave that part of the information out.
Amanda: Yeah, alright, look… There’s not a name. I think estranged family members, if we can really bullshit our way in… uhm, I think that we could do it. What do you think? I think that’s the best bet, right? Next of kin?
Robyn: Yeah that does seem to be the best bet.
Syd: This is strange…–
Amanda: Oh! Oh! Wait! I’ve got it! I’ve got it. What if we’re the coroners, and the family is there and they want to see… what their child looked like when he died? No that’s actually really fucked up, nevermind. I take that back, nobody wants to do that. [laughs] Nobody wants that, nevermind! Uh… fuck, alright, I think estranged family is what we’ve got to go with, right? Alright.
Robyn: That sounds good, yeah.
Amanda: Alright. Let’s go then.
Lilith: Ok, you walk in and there uh… You do see there is a gentleman standing behind a counter in uniform. Around him a few desks, he’s got some files on his desk. There’s y’know, all of the assorted chatter that happens in police station scenes in Law & Order. You get it.
Cassidy: Is there one of those little gate things that’s only waist-high?
Lilith: Yes. Absolutely.
Cassidy: Ok.
Amanda: … Are there donuts?
Lilith: You… Actually, I’m going to need you to roll a perception check.
Amanda: Roll for donuts? [Rolls]
Lilith: Yes
Amanda: Ah fuck! I critical failed.
Lilith: You critical failed!?
Amanda: [Laughing] Yeah!
Lilith: Yeah, you, you, uhm… Whatever you had for lunch? You are overwhelmingly smelling that and you can’t seem to discern anything else. Uh, yeah.
Syd: You see some rice balls and you call them donuts.
[Assorted Laughter]
Lilith: OK. That was good, that was… fuck.
Amanda: Oh shit…. Unless anybody else wants to do this, I’m gonna walk up to the guy at the front desk.
Lilith: Uh, h-hello, hello.
Cassidy: Mikey just sort of walks up with you, ‘cause that’s-
Amanda: Yeah.
Robyn: And I follow so I can hear.
Cassidy: He’s full on rubbernecking while looking around though.
Lilith: Uh, first and last name and what happened to you?
Amanda: [Haughtily] What happened to me?!? Let me tell you what happened to me. Jones, Petua Jones. Listen… He fucking won’t let me see what happened. I know something happened to someone in the family, I found out about it on Facebook I just need to find out what the fuck happened. They said that he died, it could’ve been Jamie, it could have been somebody else. [emphasizing with pounding on surface with each beat] One of my cousins, is dead, and my ex-husband will not tell me [voice constricting further as pounding grows in volume and emphasis] and I need to know, Now.
Lilith: Ok, I need you to roll a uh, I need you to roll a deception check.
Amanda: [Laughing] Alright. Uh… Oh shit! Alright, well uhm… 15, it’s a 20.
Lilith: It’s a 20? Okay, OK.
Amanda: It’s a 20.
Lilith: Well uh let me uh… I got a, I got a form! Uh, that I’m supposed to be… Oh boy… So he just kneels down and he’s like, looking through some stacks of paper, trying to figure out Something.
[Cat Mewls in the background]
Amanda: Cat, you go away!
Cassidy: What’s like, laid out on this desk, like forms and like stationary?
Lilith: Yeah, there’s a, well there’s a couple forms, couple stationary, and there’s a stack of files.
Cassidy: I pick up the top file, absent-mindedly. And just start like, leafing through it.
Amanda: I uh, just kind of continue crying.
Lilith: Oh, You’re looking through the file about like a stolen bicycle like… a photo of it. There’s a really nice photo of a stolen bicycle and there’s like, lines between like the bicycle and a picture of a Really disgruntled looking gentleman and like question marks all around it. Yeah, yeah.
Cassidy: I pick up the question mark photo. Is this the guy you’re looking for? Is this the guy who died?… I mean this guy looks alive. Yeah this can’t be it.
Amanda: Uh… he’s… definitely alive. [transitioning into sobs] But you know what, it just reminds me all the more [begins pounding again] of the fact that there is someone dead, and I don’t know who it is! I mean, I really hurry up down there. I mean I, I can sue this department for emotional damages if you withhold this information.
Robyn: [cackles]
Lilith: Okay-… He-… Uhh, uhh, ok, look, look, look. Here, let me just… Let me just uh, when? When did he die? When did the person die?
Amanda: W-within this week. I-it was only a few days ago and I just, it’s been covered up and I just need t-to know.
Lilith: Okay, Okay, uh let me just… uhm, I’m gonna look under ‘M’ for m-m-murder? Or Death? Or D- for death?
Amanda: No! Death. It was an accident they say [Sniffle] God knows. They say it was an accidental death, I don’t know. It was at that… It was in this town somewhere, h-he was hit, that’s all I know.
Lilith: D- You know where- You don’t know where it happened, like, in the town?
Amanda: Well obviously if I knew where it happened I would know WHO he was, because I’m related to him! So obviously that’s not on the table.
Robyn: Uh, I-I heard that a box fell on him.
Lilith: Wh-… Okay! Okay. Uh, Box, I’ll look under ‘B’ for Boxes. Uh, Anybody else…? Any, uh, actually, let me just look under B for Boxes. Uh, and he-
Amanda: [slamming her hand down] Just look for ‘B’ under the banality of evil and hurry up! I want my information!
[Assorted laughter in response]
Lilith: He kneels down and he’s looking under ‘B’ for Boxes and he’s like: Ohhh, ooooh, uhhh… Oh I think, I think I know the one you’re… Ohhh, uhhh… Is he, was that, Jeremy? Jeremy the uh, uh, the kid from down at Jackie’s?
Amanda: [Sobbing] Jeremy, Jeremy, and his last name because of course since he was recently was also divorced so tell me his last na-…
Lilith: Jones! Jones.
Amanda: Jeremy Jones! What a wonderful coincidence, of course I’m related to him! It’s just so sad!
Syd: I’m already wikipedia-ing… or not wikipedia-ing, googling Jeremy Jones.
Amanda: Jeremy Jones
Lilith: You’re getting the same like, results… You actually, there’s a couple of sites that managed to get … its like Drudge Report and that kind of shit, right? Like really… Yeah somebody really did some digging and found the name and…
Syd: Ok… yeah.
Robyn: Those globalist truck nuts…
Lilith: Yeah yeah. There’s some shit about ‘globalist truck nuts’. Its fucking… Yeah its wild! But uh, yeah, he’s got the file in his hand, he’s just: Uhhhh yeah I got it right here, Jeremy Jones. Uhm… yeah.
Amanda: Right… and of course you’re going to need to hand that to me because I really need to double check of course. It is in protocol, it’s your protocol, I have to identify the body! So please, hand it over!
Lilith: Oh we, we DEFINITELY already had the body identified by like people who like, knew him obviously a lot better than you.
Amanda: Do you want to get into trouble!?
Lilith: Uhhh…I-
Amanda: Do you want to get into trouble?!?
Lilith: I don’t think I get in trouble, I think you do. Uh, but let me just… here. I gotta, I gotta do something real quick. Uhm, and he puts the file down on his desk, and turns around, and he uh… he walks away.
Amanda: … Well we’re gonna steal it naturally, right?
Cassidy: I’ve already picked it up. Mikey has already picked up the file. Is this the one? He said this is it, right? I start flipping through it. I find uh… where are the photos.
Lilith: Uh, well… here’s the thing… The pages are stuck together with jelly donut filling. I’m sorry.
Amanda: FUCK!
Robyn: God dangit.
Lilith: You try to peel ’em apart, and actually just roll me a Dexterity check?
Cassidy: [chuckling] Ok… oh wait which one of us.
Lilith: Mikey.
Cassidy: 18.
Lilith: 18? Yeah, so you can kinda see a couple pictures and it certainly looks like someone who was crushed, possibly with truck nuts but… Yeah it’s all torn up because there’s moisture and things just got stuck together. It’s just all bad.
Amanda: [deep sigh]… Well, alright… Is there any other- or does the file, I should probably ask Mikey, does the file have a front page or let me see that.
Cassidy: Yeah, ok! I hand it over.
Amanda: Does the file have like, have any additional information about Jeremy Jones?
Lilith: It doesn’t have a whole lot of information about Jeremy Jones. You see a short listing of: he was 26 years old, worked at Jackie’s Customs, childless, lived by himself.
Amanda: Uh, next of kin?
Lilith: Uhm… There’s kind of big red question marks, there.
Amanda: There’s, wow, alright. I put down the file, or I guess [indecipherable]
Cassidy: Big red question marks as in ‘the police didn’t know’ or big red question marks as in ‘that part is underneath jam and we can’t read it’?
[Laughter]
Lilith: Well, yeah it’s actually just a little bit of both. There’s like, jam stains…. You can tell that somebody wrote something next to the red question marks after crossing out the red question marks but yeah, you can’t tell what they wrote.
Amanda: Love it… Well, I guess… Mikey, you can hold onto that or put it down or whatever. Hey… There’s nothing we’re gonna get from this.
Cassidy: Mikey is smelling the file.
Lilith: It smells…
Cassidy: Mikey is now licking the jam.
Lilith: Yeah it tastes… It tastes pretty good! It’s raspberry.
Cassidy: Hm! Raspberry. [Audible lip smackings]
Amanda: Hm. Uh, Kevin, Electra… Any ideas?
Robyn: Do uh… Do we wanna sneak around? It seems like a risky… Even I can tell that would not be smart.
Amanda: Yeah… These guys seem like total dumbasses. I think that we probably don’t have anything else to do here unless… I mean, we know his name I guess, and…
Robyn: We’ve still got that house to go to.
Amanda: Yeah I say we go there.
Cassidy: Mmm, this is good you want some?
Lilith: [Laughter]
Robyn: I-I yyy-I do. I take one of the pages that hasn’t been touched by Mikey and I start licking it.
Amanda: I’m on a low-fibre diet, it just goes right through me…. Y’know when you get to my age….
Cassidy: Mmm. He nods sagely.
Amanda: Alright, I guess, you and your snack and everybody else. We should probably head out. Because I feel like, maybe if he comes back, it won’t go great…
Lilith: Alright. Y’all head out and…
Amanda: Pffft. Just taking a confidential police document…. Fuckin’ love it.
Lilith: Oh absolutely. Nobody sees a goddamned thing, I’m not even gonna have you roll any checks for that, yeah, yeah. No, no…
Robyn: Oh good.
Lilith: You leave the Poulton Independence Garrison Police Department behind and it sounds like y’all wanted to go to Samantha Timmons house!
Robyn: Yeah right? Hey Mikey, let’s head on over to that house in our car.
Cassidy: Do I have to drive somewhere?
Amanda: Yeah.
Cassidy: OK.
Amanda: GPS that shit again Kevin?
Robyn: You know it.
Lilith: You make it to this gaudy as all fuck McMansion. And…
Cassidy: Like a white people gaudy or… ?
Amanda: [indecipherable] hates that shit.
Lilith: Oh very white people gaudy. Yeah, yeah. And you see a sensible sedan parked out in front of it. There’s a three-car garage and front doorway.
Cassidy: So what is this place?
Amanda: This is a house where somebody died. His wife lives here now, and we think it’s connected to the other guy in the delicious snack you enjoyed earlier, his death. Yes.
Cassidy: Oh… Oh! So these two guys got killed and you think it might be the same thing.
Amanda: Or they might be related to one another, we’re not really sure.
Cassidy: Oh ok, like, yeah ok.
Amanda: So again, if you feel anything, let us know.
Cassidy: Well like, do you want me to look for something?
Amanda: I’m not really sure what we’re looking for, that’s the problem. It would probably be a lot easier if we did, but until we do, everybody just keep their eyes open I guess… Uh, story… Any ideas Electra, Kevin, about how we do this?
Syd: No.
Cassidy: I mean, if you want I could, like… LOOK for something.
Robyn: That sounds, that sounds great.
Cassidy: Oh ok, I can do that. Just let me know when you want me to start.
Syd: I mean I can definitely be on the lookout for any… strange vibes or uh, things like that. Um… I’m not… I don’t really know how to talk to people. I mean, not in this situation.
Amanda: Well… Gotcha. I mean, look, we read plenty of articles about Jeremy Jones’ death. Everybody’s reporting on it; maybe we’re journalists this time. Maybe this time it’ll work.
Robyn: Yeah, let’s try that journalism angle out.
Amanda: Alright uhm… alright. Well, we’ve got two people with high charisma modifiers let’s just go for this thing. I guess we go up and knock on the door, yeah. Alright.
Robyn: Let’s do it. I, Kevin, at least approaches the door, and… ?
Amanda: Yeah, I think we walk up.
Robyn: And knocks.
Cassidy: So we’re all just walking up as a group?
Amanda: Yeah we’re all walking up and checking out that door.
Cassidy: Ok. Just let me know when you guys want me to look.
Lilith: The door opens and there is a middle-aged woman, she’s wearing all white. And she looks at the four of you and ‘Oh, h-hello, how are all you?’
Cassidy: I’m Mikey.
Lilith: Hello Mikey. Uh… That’s a mighty fine shirt you got there Mikey.
Cassidy: Thanks.
Lilith: Uh, how can I help all of y’all?
Robyn: Hey, we’re from uh… We’re from…
Amanda: This is…
Cassidy: We heard there’s a guy who lived here that died, and we think it might be connected to another guy who died.
Amanda: T-… well yes.
Lilith: Oh. Yeah you heard about Victor, ok. Well I mean, I’ve been… uh uh are you… Well, there’s four of you so, what are you… are you doing something here? I mean that is my late husband.
Cassidy: I’m supposed to be hunting evil but, I mostly these days just walk around going where I think I’m supposed to go. Sometimes I get feelings.
Amanda: Wh-what he’s saying is that we are, um, from the Spiritual Star Times trying to uncover the evils of the world and head the press in the right direction. And we just want to make sure that your late husband’s story is uh… represented to the fullest extent that it possibly could be. Y’know these local newspapers, the national news, they really just sling a lot of mud. And we want to make sure that your story is well represented.
Lilith: Oh I know all about the lamestream media, you don’t gotta tell me.
Amanda: [sighs]
Lilith: I didn’t know that journalists worked in packs of four but, that tracks.
Amanda: That’s what we call ‘accountability’.
Lilith: Oh, oh, okay that’s… that sounds fair. Y’all… Y’all come in.
[Live at KBOO for the Noontime Jamboree – Miller and Sasser]
Lilith: So you walk into this woman’s house and you can see she has very nice leather furniture, you hear soft country music over the radio. And she sits down, she’s got a glass of wine next to her. So what can I help you fine journalists with? I am a supporter of, y’know, the truth and Victor, he’d want his story told right.
Amanda: I’m-I’m so glad to hear that you are vested in this. I pull out my little moleskine notebook again I guess and I start taking notes as if y’know I guess we’re sitting down and interviewing her now.
Cassidy: Mikey is just kinda pacing the room, bare feet slapping on the floor, looking at stuff.
Amanda: [Snickers] Sounds about right.
Lilith: She is watching Mikey just like… specifically his feet just making contact with the floor.
Cassidy: They make nice little plap plap noises, he has very flat feet.
Robyn: Yeah, we’re uh… we’re from Vice Magazine so.. We’re kinda out there.
[Laughter]
Syd: Oh god.
Amanda: Oh my god…
Syd: We’re gonna get kicked out.
Robyn: Sorry if that’s-
Amanda: I JUST introduced us as a different newspaper, you realize that right?
Robyn: Oh shit I-… Well that didn’t… I didn’t say that then.
Syd: We’re a coalition of journalists.
Amanda: It’s actually just a offshoot of Vice, one of Vice’s many media empires. The Christian Spiritual Times.
Syd: Yeah, it’s spelled W-E-I-S.
Lilith: [Laughs]
Amanda: Weis? Okay… Good, good, um. My associate is, um, y’know obviously he takes these jobs very seriously. He’s a little bit… unsettled. Just tell us: how did your husband die
Lilith: [gasps] Well, we were… I was here, he was out in the garage, working on his truck. And y’know we keep things very well locked up here, I’ve got a pretty good security system and y’know I… One moment I was giving him updates on when dinner was gonna be ready and then, I walk in the next moment and he’s- he’s dead! And I uh, they said he was strangled to death and but they couldn’t find any reason to find that I was the person, god forbid, that I was the person who strangled him. And they couldn’t find any way anyone would’ve gotten in or out of the garage.
Syd: … I have a question.
Lilith: Well, ask away!
Syd: Was your husband a fan of the novelty vehicle customization item known as ‘Truck Nuts’.
Lilith: Oh…. Yeah, yeah, well… that’s why I keep the truck in the garage. Yeah he had a pair of those, on the ugh… ugh…
Syd: Did he buy it from Ricky’s?
Lilith: From Ricky’s? Uh…
Robyn: Jackie’s.
[Snickering]
Syd: Jackie’s.
Lilith: Uh, y’know what? He might’ve… I don’t know when he bought those, we-… well, this might get a little personal but we ARE Amazon Prime members and we uh-
[Laughter]
Syd: Hey, Two-Day Free Shipping.
Lilith: He might’ve gotten them on Amazon Prime or he may have stopped over at Jackie’s. I don’t know.
Robyn: Um, now you said, I wanna get this straight, you said the police couldn’t figure out how anyone would get into the garage right?
Lilith: Yeah or really any part of the house, we were, I keep-… I’ve had troubles with so-some people and so we keep things pretty, pretty locked up here.
Robyn: So the door from the garage to the house was also locked.
Lilith: That was unlocked but…
Robyn: Ahh!
Lilith: The house was secure.
Robyn: I see.
Amanda: Alright, so…You said you’ve had ‘troubles’ with- I mean, you seem like an upstanding pillar of your community… what kind of troubles with folks have you had around here?
Lilith: Well… I’m not sure if I should say. I mean, this isn’t really related to the story of my husband. Uh… I want you to roll a persuasion check.
Amanda: Feel like we’re ‘bout to hear some racist shit [rolls dice] Uh….
Cassidy: Hey, it’s equally likely it could be homopho- well it’s more likely to be racist shit this is Texas.
Amanda: It’s 15 plus… Oh nice, 20.
Lilith: I… Look, I am a mommy blogger and I refuse to back down from my beliefs. I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman I believe that vaccines… they’re no good. Transgenders? Not a fan um… And I, just really like confederate monuments. Like a lot.
Syd: Wait ok, outside of character what instigated this?
Robyn: Yeah what question is she answering?
Amanda: I asked her, literally I asked her what kind of troubles she’s had and her victim complex just absolutely kicks the fuck in I guess. ‘Cause that’s what old southern ladies in McMansions do.
Cassidy: I mean, so far this is the most realistic character of this game.
Lilith: [laughs]
Robyn & Amanda: Yeah.
Lilith: I again, I refuse to back down from my beliefs. I’m a mommy blogger and I do blog about the other things that I have just mentioned. And I-… sometimes people don’t like it when a strong [sotto voce] white woman stands up for herself!
Amanda: So what you’re saying is you’re being attacked from all sides by the liberal media.
Lilith: Absolutely, absolutely! This is why I wanted to talk to y’all. This is why I wanted to get the story… I mean I really wanted to get the story of my husband …
Amanda: Yes, well… Look, I mean, just… let me, let me make sure. So the garage we just mentioned, Jackie’s; that was the garage that he usually went to?
Lilith: Ah, yeah he went there to pick up parts sometimes.
Amanda: And… I mean, was your husband like you, was he a good man.
Syd: … I look at you confused.
Amanda: I’m just really really good at lying.
Syd: Yeah, it’s still, like…
Cassidy: I mean your lies at the police station were less than stellar. If we’re being real.
Amanda: It’s true.
Lilith: Well he was… He was a strong and upstanding man, stood up for his beliefs. He specifically seemed to believe mostly in his right to display certain obscenities on vehicles or…
Amanda: Alright, well, I mean… Last question: Do you think it would be too much to ask to see the garage where your husband tragically passed away.
Lilith: I… I think that’d be alright. I think that’d be alright. Did y’all wanna take pictures, do you have a photographer?
Amanda: We uh…
Robyn: I’m a photographer.
Amanda: Yes he is.
Lilith: OK I’m gonna need you to roll a deception check on that one.
Robyn: Will do. Will do. [Rolling Dice] It’s gonna be a 16, so… 20!
Lilith: Well, y’know I… You just have your cellphone or something? I guess anybody can be a photographer these days.
Robyn: Technically anyone can be a photographer but the tech you get when you’re a journalist just really optimizes the phone cam. You couldn’t even tell that it was a phone cam.
Lilith: O-oh Ok. Alright. She brings you over to a door kind of going off of the living room. Well, here’s the garage, the truck’s in there. Y’know, the police got a real good look at it when it actually happened but I guess if you wanna take a look. Try not to y’know, mess with anything.
Robyn: Of course. Am I the only one she’s like- Am I the only one going in?
Amanda: I think we all go in.
Lilith: When you go in you see… I don’t remember where the F-200 or F-250 series is at, but this is a F-540 or some shit like that, just a big ass truck. There’s some tools on the wall, and you can definitely see just, dangling off the trailer hitch, just a glistening beautiful pale flesh-colored truck nuts.
Cassidy: Woah that truck has balls. You guys seen this, right? That truck has balls.
Robyn: It’s pretty normal here.
Syd: Yeah… I would like to investigate the truck.
Cassidy: Did you want me to look now?
Amanda: Yes, Mikey, you look too. But Electra, do your thing.
Lilith: Yeah, both of y’all roll investigation checks for me.
Cassidy: Oh I’m not casting, I’m not making any investigation checks yet.
Lilith: Ok.
Cassidy: Mikey just sort of starts rocking in place, like onto the balls and the heels of his feet and then slaps the front of his feet onto the ground. He does that a couple times with his eyes closed? Then he opens them and you notice his eyes are pitch fucking black, again. And I’m casting Detect Magic.
Lilith: Holy shit, okay, nice! How do-…
Cassidy: Casting time is one action, but it’s channeled for up to ten minutes… For the duration you sense the presence of magic up to 30 feet of you, if you sense magic in this way you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature in or object in the area that is magical… Oh and you will learn its school of magic, if any.
Lilith: Ok, you… Those… Mikey sees those nuts are just glowing like red. There’s something fucking dark and evil about those truck nuts.
Cassidy: I wouldn’t touch those balls if I were you. There’s something… wrong with them. What’s the type of magic that’s around them?
Lilith: Um… OK. You actually do get a vague, necromantic whiff from these balls.
Cassidy: Right.
Amanda: Great… Undead balls. Mikey, what have you found?
Cassidy: Those balls, there’s something wrong with them. Like wrong, like shouldn’t be here… wrong.
Syd: Tell me about they shouldn’t be here.
Amanda: [Laughs]
Cassidy: Like, more wrong than a truck with balls, obviously.
Amanda: Right… Well?
Robyn: This is… This might sound crazy but, do you think the balls strangled him?
Cassidy: I dunno!…
Amanda: I think… I think that they certainly-
Cassidy: I don’t really want to touch them or get any closer than I am right now.
Amanda: I think that somebody should do the opposite though, shouldn’t we… touch, like, see if something happens? I mean, God, it’s not like we haven’t had any leads, why don’t we check ‘em out? I mean… does anyone wanna go touch the balls?
Robyn: Yeah I’ll touch ‘em.
Amanda: Alright, good. Better you than me.
Syd: My gear’s already turned on.
Robyn: Oh, you got gear? OK Yeah! I think the gear’s probably better, I was gonna poke ‘em!
Lilith: [Laughter]
Syd: I… I’d hit ‘em with my bat(??), I guess.
[Laughter]
Syd: Which is attached to my hip by a magnet.
Lilith: Ok, ok.
Syd: So I kind of just… nudge at ‘em. Yeah.
Lilith: Ok, so… Here’s what you see. You see, the nuts, they sway slightly. And then they just… it kinda looks like they melt….
Syd: That’s fucked up.
Lilith: It looks like it got a lot hotter in this room. And they just sag all the way to the floor until you see them just kind of break away from the Truck. Just like a viscous silicone tan liquid just kinda snakes across the floor and down a uh, little drain.
Syd: That’s not normal… That can’t be good.
Amanda: Noooo….
Cassidy: I think we should probably follow those balls.
Robyn: [sighs] … Yeah.
Amanda: We’re going to have to go find sewer balls?
Cassidy: Uh, so how possessed? I’m still channeling detect magic so how do I see this?
Lilith: You do see the uh, very, very… these haunted ass balls. They melt away into the floor and after pretty quickly you no longer can see that glowing aura. It seemed to go not that too far underground but it seemed to move away from the garage, back towards the street.
Cassidy: They went that way. And I just point to whatever direction they would have gone to underground.
Amanda: Well I think we should make a speedy exit and follow those balls!
Syd: Yeah.
Cassidy: OK I don’t know how much longer I can keep looking though.
Robyn: Um, ugh, yeah…
Amanda: Alright.
Robyn: I don’t think- Is the grate like, large enough that we could all fit if we removed it somehow?
Lilith: No, it’s like a foot by six inches.
Robyn: Ok cool. I mean, yeah, let’s follow, our only option is to follow those balls.
Amanda: Alright! Well, uh… Samantha, it was a lovely pleasure, I mean, we really… We’re overwhelmed with the story. It will be up, tweeted it, everything, we will get it.
Lilith: OK, alright, sounds good, do y’all need like a… an e-mail or something?
Amanda: We, we found you here, didn’t we!? So we know! We know you’re on the freedom list, we will find you.
Lilith: OH! Okay, yeah! Y’know I’m uh… I’m on a number of mailing lists. Well, God bless America. Y’all have a nice night. And she closes the door, behind y’all.
[Skagos – Blossoms Will Sprout From The Carcass fades in]
Lilith: So y’all leave the poor bereaved Mrs. Timmons house and pile back into the winnebago. Mikey takes the wheel, his eyes still black, and follows the faint glow through the streets of Poulton. Winding and curving through the streets, and eventually you all find yourselves back at Jackie’s Customs and looks like whatever that thing was, it just went inside.

It’s the voice of woe
It’s the call of the moon
It’s the cold retribution

"TRANSCRIPT - EPISODE 3
""Ah, Nuts"" vol III","(Transcription by Micha Cavaseno, contact for transcription work here)
[Music Fades In: Skagos – Blossoms Will Sprout From the Carcass]
Lilith: Hello everyone my name is Lucifer. Welcome to this the third edition of Ghostpuncher Corps. This week the gang are closing in on the testicular spectre haunting Poulton, Texas. They have finally learned to start leaning on their new friend Mikey and his peculiar skills.
Cassidy: I only ever met one ghost. It was weird.
Amanda: Oh!
Robyn: Well oh, hey wait, that’s more… That’s a lot of ghosts, relatively.
Cassidy: I just, like, fixed… her. With my brain!… Can y’all not do that?
Amanda: That might be a ‘You’ thing.
Cassidy: Mikey just sort of starts rocking in place… Then he opens them and you notice his eyes are pitch fucking black…. Those balls there’s something wrong with them.
Lilith: That’s good, it really bothered me that they left him in the winnebago. It’s just… rude.
As they close in on their first mark as hunters under my employ, we’ll see how the gang do in closing the deal. Hopefully they don’t make too much noise. Wouldn’t want to attract any unwanted attention.
[Musical interlude]
Lilith: Alright y’all. When we last left off, you were outside Jackie’s Customs. You were… Mikey was behind the van. Mikey just watched as the glowing object that he saw under the street just scurried into the building and out of sight.
Cassidy: By object you mean the shapeshifting truck nuts.
Lilith: Yeah, the shapeshifting truck nuts-
Cassidy: The haunted shapeshifting truck nuts.
Lilith: The Haunted shapeshifting truck nuts, thank you for clarifying.
Cassidy: The killer haunted shapeshifting truck nuts.
Amanda: [Laughter]
Lilith: You don’t know that yet!
Amanda: I mean, probable cause, right?
Lilith: Probable ca-? Oh my god.
Cassidy: At very least, the truck nuts were a witness.
Syd: I think we spent too much time in that police department.
Lilith: God… Alright. So… so you see the haunted truck nuts go in. It’s about 11 o’clock so the custom shop is closed up for the evening. All the lights are off…
Cassidy: Oh uh, what time is it? Like, you say evening.
Lilith: Eleven.
Cassidy: Oh, so like night.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah. Like super night.
Cassidy: Like full on, like it’s dark outside, ok.
Lilith: Yeah. It’s dark outside, it is closed.
Amanda: Well, I think that we should break in! Unless it’s not locked in which case, that wouldn’t be necessary.
Syd: I’d like to check for traps AKA Alarm systems.
Amanda: [building laughter]
Lilith: W-Wait. Hey, y’all are still in the car!
Syd: Ok
Amanda: Oh oh, alright, I’d like to- I’d like to retcon all that then.
[Assorted Laughter]
Robyn: Let’s get out of the car.
Amanda: I’d like to check for car alarms… OK, let’s get out of the car.
Lilith: OK, everyone’s out of the car. Good job.
Amanda: [stammering] So, about how far from the location are we?
Lilith: Hey, you’re right in front of the door. We’re moving this along. We did it.
Amanda: Great… Ah, fantastic.
Syd: [whoops]
Amanda: I guess we should probably make a perception check just to see if there are any obvious cameras, security alarms, that kind of shit, right?
Lilith: Go ahead.
Amanda: Yeah, that’s a… 7. [groans]
Lilith: Seven? You do not see any kind of cameras or anything like that.
Cassidy: I mean, do I have to roll perception to notice a sign for an alarm company in the window?
Syd: Well…
Lilith: I mean… I guess you don’t since you specifically asked about it? There is not a sign for an alarm company in the window. However, I’m really interested to hear why Mikey would be thinking about that.
Cassidy: I mean, that was kind of out of character. It was just…
Lilith: Yeah, yeah.
Amanda: Our helpful game wizard to the side, Mikey’s twin… alter-ego or something, fuck.
Lilith: [chuckles]
Cassidy: Sometimes Mikey gets divine psychic inspiration. The uh, the sasquatch hive mind.
Lilith: That… is…
Cassidy: In the form of me meta-gaming.
[Assorted Laughter]
Lilith: Ok, well, fuckin’ cataclysmic extraplanar event that none of you can see cuts of Mikey’s immediate connection to the sasquatch hive-mind that helps him cheat so, Electra! Gimme a perception check.
Syd: Oh, perception check… I’ll just accept-
Lilith: Or whatever check you want to give me.
Syd: I mean, it doesn’t matter. I mean, I rolled the die… It’s perception at 16, investigation at 17.
Lilith: OK, fantastic. You’re investigating the shit out of all this stuff. You super don’t see any cameras.
Syd: Ok.
Amanda: Alright.
Lilith: You guys, there aren’t cameras.
Amanda: Great, great. I feel like even if there were by the time that we get in here and start wrasslin’ with whatever this thing is, it won’t matter if there were cops also, so… Shall we break into this building?
Syd: Are we around the back, or do we come up to the front?
Lilith: I mean, I-
Syd: It’s probably best that we’re not facing the street.
Lilith: Actually, the front door, it kinda has like a weird… it’s one of those things where you come off into the driveway and the door is still facing away from the street? Uh, it’s actually not visible at all from the road.
Syd: [mutters] Ok.
Cassidy: So all the lights are off inside the body shop?
Lilith: Yeah, all the lights inside are off.
Cassidy: Does it look like anyone’s around?
Lilith: Does not.
Cassidy: Well what about outside, on the street?
Lilith: Outside on the street? People are driving by… It’s late at night so the roads are pretty clear.
Cassidy: I’ll just try the door, to see if it’s unlocked, y’know? Stranger things have happened.
Lilith: It is locked.
Cassidy: Ok.
Amanda: Alright.
Robyn: I’ll pick the door.
Lilith: Hell yeah, yeah, roll me a lock pick check.
Robyn: Ah… That’s a, oooh boy, that’s a 20 without a modifier.
Lilith: OK! You… Yeah, yeah it is. That lock, like… it is unmade. No, the door opens up and you see inside. It is the same sales floor area that you saw before. Very dimly lit, doesn’t seem to be anybody inside. And yeah, there are two doors; one of them behind the counter that you saw before? And the other one, the double glass doors leading to the sound room that you were in before.
Amanda: I think that it probably will gravitate towards that room where the murder happened? That was kind of the vibe that we- That was where we landed on that right? That room was definitely the most weird and probable for y’know, supernatural occurrences or whatever?
Robyn: Yeah.
Cassidy: I mean that does… that seems to reason.
Amanda: Alright. I mean I think that we should just head right there. Everybody, y’know, ready yourselves or whatever but that’s probably where we should go.
Syd: I turn on my gear.
Lilith: Hell yeah.
Cassidy: What’s the timeframe between us, like… we basically just ran right over from that woman’s house.
Lilith: Yep!
Cassidy: Oh, ok, so yeah there was no rest time or anything?
Lilith: No, no. Two doors; one of ‘em glass, one of them is just a regular door leading to the back. It does say “Employees Only”.
Amanda: That was the same “Employees Only” room that we tried to get into last time. Because I remember that there were two right? There was one inside the spinning rims room and then there’s the other one? But I’m pretty sure-
Lilith: There’s a lot of doors that say “Employees Only”. This one’s out on the sales floor, which is kind of separated away from any doors that you have tried or succeeded to get through.
Amanda: Gotcha. And, the other one, I remember now, so it was through… We were in the room with all the speakers and the “Employees Only” room in there was… where the truck nuts were.
Lilith: Yep… Yes.
Amanda: So, does everyone want to head through the glass doors, and into that room?
Cassidy: I mean Mikey’s just kinda waiting for someone else to take the lead. He’s not an investigator.
Amanda: Alright. Ok yeah… So I walk over to the glass doors and… push on them? Are they automatic?
Lilith: They’re push doors. They do have a ‘swoosh’ thing, but that’s been turned off.
Amanda: Mkay. I push on them.
Lilith: Ok. You open up those doors and you walk in the room. The room is again it’s very very dimly lit, just enough where you can safely find your way around. But you do see a button that says ‘Demo’ in the center of the room. It’s kind of on a pedestal.
Amanda: That wasn’t there the last time we were here, was it?
Syd: [hesitantly] It’s just a… just a lone pedestal?… Alone in the middle of the room?
Lilith: Yeah it’s a lone pedestal. This place has a flair for the dramatic.
Syd: OK.
Cassidy: OK well Mikey is gonna push that button unless somebody stops him… Like I’m walking towards the button right now.
Amanda: I could’ve called that.
Robyn: I’m fine with this.
Syd: I don’t know if we should… press that. We should maybe-
Cassidy: K, well he’s at the button. He’s about to push it.
Syd: … Oh no.
Cassidy: I mean, unless somebody physically stops him. Or tells him not to.
Amanda: [in the background] I think this is gonna happen.
Lilith: Ok, Mikey has pressed the button. I’m just calling it.
Cassidy: There was enough time for somebody to say that.
[Music starts to fade in]
Lilith: You all it’s… it’s like a crushing wave of sound goes over all of you. You hear this horrible horrible racket penetrating your skull. And actually each of you hear kind of distinct… there’s a lot of different things playing like radio broadcasts, songs you never heard before… Kevin, you hear, what was that um… the band that you have a tattoo of their logo? What was that band?
Robyn: Oh uh, I don’t know, I made it up.
Lilith: Oh you made it up? Come up with a name.
Robyn: Come up with a name now? Ah shit, uh… ah… “Evil Circus”.
Lilith: “Evil Circus”, that’s… That’s perfect. And would you be able to come up with one of Evil Circus’ hit jams?
Syd: Oh my god…
Robyn: Uhm… “Dad Slayer”!
Lilith: “Dad Slayer”! Hell yeah, ok, so! You specifically hear in this horrible cacophony… Coldplay’s cover of “Dad Slayer” that they did for the Vampire Diaries soundtrack? It’s like your least favorite song in the entire world. Mikey? You hear Raffi played at half-speed, and it’s one of the most scary things that you’ve ever heard of. Electra, you hear a track from your Myspace page circa 2007, that you have tried to bury. And Petua, you hear both Norah Jones and Babylonian ritual chants that have never been recorded before? And I need you all to make Constitution saving throws.
Syd: The fuck…
Amanda: [rolling dice] Ah fuck, um… I critical failed.
Lilith: Alright. Let’s hear how everybody else did!
Syd: A 5…?
Cassidy: Oh, I got a 15.
Robyn: I got a 9.
Lilith: OK, everyone except for, ooh… That’ll be interesting. Except for Mikey, you now have Disadvantage on all skill checks you can make while you hear this horrible, horrible noise. Mikey? It’s loud and it’s weird and disturbing but you’re good.
Cassidy: I’m good.
Amanda: Do I get anything for critical failing?
Lilith: God I forg-… Yeah, yeah. I mean, what do I- Oh, you know what? That’s easy. You take 3 damage.
Amanda: THREE!? Okay…. Damn, sorry, that was melodramatic.
Lilith: [laughs]
Cassidy: I mean, I’m going to guess that you have like, 8 hit points total.
Amanda: Yeah, I’ve got 19 typically but…
Cassidy: Wait, nineteen?
Amanda: Wait no, that doesn’t sound right. No, 9, sorry.
Cassidy: Nine, ok, I’m like “How do you have more health than I do?”
Amanda: There’s not supposed to be a one there, sorry. Yeah, great, lovely, 6 hit points going on here. Sorry about that. Electra, you were going to dive for this button.
Syd: I’m going to dive to press the button and hopefully stop this racket…. And this god awful Fruity Loops song that I made 10 years ago.
[Music stops before slowly fading back in]
Lilith: You kinda hear like… You hear everything just kind of start over.
Syd: Oh no…
Lilith: Everyone except for Kevin, you see a little cable running underneath… It kind of goes from the wall to underneath one of the housing sections for the speakers? And yeah, the sound is continuing. And it’s horrible.
Syd: I want to… destroy… I have a knife in my boot. So when I grab that cable? And take out my knife and just fucking, cut that fucker in half.
Lilith: You just cut the cable in half?
Syd: Yeah, just pull the cable and run the knife under it and just yank…. I’m just desperate to get rid of this…
Lilith: Hmm, ok!… Ok.
Amanda: That doesn’t seem like a good idea.
Syd: The knife is insulated, it’s fine.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah good thing that that knife’s insulated so… You see there’s like a spark and everything like that. And as you pull back on it, you see a little, black, like a box that this cable was connected to? And on it in big white letters is “SAFETY INHIBITOR” and now I’m going to need all of you to run another Constitution saving throw.
Amanda: Oh fuck.
Syd: What the… ?
Amanda: Oh, phew, 18.
Lilith: Eighteen.
Syd: 7.
Robyn: 11.
Cassidy: 10?
Lilith: OK. So…
[Music shifts to an abrasive breakcore track]
Lilith: Petua and Kevin… You guys together are alright. Everybody else just took 2 damage as you just kinda feel, it just digs deeper in your ears. It is just like, pulse pounding, like loud, loud, loud. And you see the speakers and they are just like, shaking.
Syd: Is like a… switch anywhere, a power… something… anywhere?
Lilith: You do see a switch on the Safety Inhibitor that reads “ON” that goes from off to on, it was in the off position.
Cassidy: I’m just gonna run to the closest speaker to me? And just straight up, put my fist through it.
Lilith: Actually just roll me a d10?… No modifier.
Cassidy: OK [rolls dice] No modifier? Then I got a 6.
Lilith: OK so you like… smash your hand through this speaker and you actually see 6 other ones kind of short out and they stop working and the audio is marginally less terrifying.
Amanda: I think that I should do something about this, so… I would like to cast a spell. I would like to attack the speakers as well, this time.
Lilith: Hell Yeah.
Amanda: I’m going to cast “Eldritch Blast”, it is a cantrip, can I do that?… Alright, great
Lilith: Yeah!… Cool, roll me a d10.
Amanda: [Rolls Die] Oh nice… It is. An evocation cantrip…. It’s an 8.
Cassidy: Is that a cantrip for you?… Wow.
Lilith: It is… It’s an eight? Perfect. 8 speakers just fucking explode, it’s getting quieter.
Amanda: Oh, well I also think that… Can I put a little bit of spice on this since it’s the first time my character has cast a spell?
Lilith: Yes.
Amanda: OK…. So Petua is still being assailed by this wave of sound, right? And I think that she closes her eyes and focuses on how disgusting it is to hear Norah Jones and these Babylonian chants and this ridiculous pop music altogether… And her eyes just kind of roll over, and she closes them and listens for a second and then summons this… very, very intense wave of eldritch energy.
Lilith: Hell Yes. Hell. Yes. 8 speakers, ka-blam. They are no longer doing it. Anybody else wanna take a swing?
Syd: I’ve got my bat out and I’m just fucking…. Going wild.
Lilith: Swingin’? Alright. Yeah. Just roll me a Damage roll for that.
Syd: [Rolls dice] 4.
Lilith: Four? Alright. Four more speakers explode and you actually start to see a few other ones are just kind of shorting out. And let’s just say, hey, Kevin, do you want to take a swing?
Robyn: Yeah… Actually I was gonna ask about electricity concerns? Because I got a metal sword-
Lilith: That is true.
Robyn: But I don’t think Kevin would… I don’t think he would be smart enough to wonder that, so I’m not gonna…
Amanda: [laughs] Also if you bought it at the mall, it’s…Yeah.
Cassidy: I feel like Kevin would just get caught up in smashing.
Robyn: Yeah, he’s just gotta smash… What am I rolling again?
Lilith: Hell Yeah. Uh… You’re just rolling the Damage roll for your sword which, I think I have that written down there as a one d6 +4 or something? I don’t…
Robyn: That’s a 3.
Lilith: Three? Ok, cool. So, three more speakers explode. You feel just a slight jolt of electricity, it doesn’t do any damage, but you definitely… It just makes your arm feel all weird? So just write that down on your character sheet, arm feels all weird.
Robyn: Ok.
[Assorted Laughter]
Lilith: And the speakers, they all just like in a giant crackle of static and sparks they all just stop. And the room is once again quiet.
Syd: I’m still smashing.
Lilith: [bursts into laughter]
Syd: I’m just very upset.
Amanda: [In a concerned tone] Uh, Electra, Electra? I think y-… You probably don’t have to do that anymore. I think you did it…
Syd: Yeah… Still feels good…. We should probably get into the garage. Whatever.
Amanda: I know… Uh, the room, right?
Syd: Yeah.
Lilith: So… There are three doors going from this room there is, or actually I should say there are four. There is the set of glass doors you came through, there is one to your left marked “EMPLOYEES ONLY”, one in front of you also marked “EMPLOYEES ONLY”. That’s the one that you’ve put together is the stock room. And then one to your right that says “CUSTOMS” which, you’ve went through before.
Syd: Did anyone else hear… particularly strange things?
Amanda: I mean, from the music? It wasn’t great, I’ll give it that but…
Syd: Anything out of the ordinary.
Amanda: I definitely heard something that was so ancient that even I haven’t heard it so, I’m not really sure what that was up with, but it was-
Cassidy: It was like a song that you used to know… ? But like you’re hearing it in a dream. But it doesn’t sound right.
Amanda: Right, like you can’t put the song to what the song is, almost.
Syd: Right.
Robyn: [affects twang] I knew what I was hearing. It was from that Vampire Diaries movie, I hated it.
[Assorted stifled laughter]
Amanda: Is that a new accent, Kevin?
Robyn: Hm?
Lilith: I love it! I love it.
Amanda: Did you, did Kevin get electrocuted so hard that now he sounds like–
Robyn: [twang maintains] I… This has been my voice this whole time!
Lilith: [Laughs]
Amanda: Right, no, of course! It must have been me, we were hearing so much awful shit that we just don’t remember what anything sounds like anymore. Great.
Syd: … Is the door… open?
Lilith: It is still locked, but I will let Kevin take another crack at a lock-picking check.
Robyn: A 20.
Lilith: Hell yeah. OK. That door just pops right open.
Syd: [whispered] Yes.
Amanda: OK. I think that I would like to make an Investigation check…? Into like, the room specifically. I want to kind of look into the room, I think I have Dark Vision but I want to look into the room and check out that spot. If I can see it from the threshold of the door without going in yet. Like kind of peer over there…
Lilith: Ok, Ok. Yeah go ahead.
Amanda: [Rolls Dice] Nice… Hmm, Perception… 14?
Lilith: Fourteen?
Amanda: No wait, with Investigation is… is 15, sorry.
Lilith: Fifteen, perfect. You see just sort of a dimly-lit room. You’re kind of starting to feel those same kind of vibes you were feeling before. But it’s just kind of a dark stock room.
Cassidy: How about how big is it?
Lilith: It’s… I would say maybe 300 feet wide? 100 feet back?
Cassidy: Ok.
Amanda: I turn to, I guess to Mikey… Do you feel anything in this room? Oh wait, is Mikey’s Detect Magic still going? Probably not, right?
Cassidy: No, it’s long expired.
Lilith: Yeah.
Amanda: Damn, ok…
Cassidy: It only lasts 10 minutes.
Amanda: I mean, it’s still polite to ask. Mikey, what do you think?
Cassidy: What do I think about what?
Amanda: Should we go in, do you feel anything? I-I’m getting some serious vibes from that corner of the room where the blood was?
Cassidy: Oh, I dunno, it looks spooky though.
Amanda: Yeah… I mean, I think that we should go in. What do you guys think?
Syd: Absolutely… I’m ready.
Amanda: Alright…. Okay, I guess we’re all as ready as we’ll ever be. I walk into the room.
Cassidy: Oh wait, is it dark?
Lilith: It’s very dark, yes.
Cassidy: Like… Ok, I’ll cast Produce Flame. You all look away for a second and before you know it Mikey’s hand’s on fire.
Amanda: [laughter]
Syd: [concerned murmuring]
Cassidy: He doesn’t look very perturbed by it.
Amanda: Uh… does that happen often?
Cassidy: … Does what happen? Oh, this! Nono, this is just something I can do. Don’t worry about it, I just figured so we could see better.
Syd: … Can we see better?
Lilith: Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
Syd: OK.
Lilith: What do you see, what do you feel, all of these very important questions… The first thing that you see, reflected with the fire in their eyes, you see just rats. Rats eyes lining the shelves, and they are watching you.
Syd: Just some friends.
Amanda: Can anyone, and this is not something that I would normally ask on a regular day, but this is not a regular day… Can anyone talk to animals?
Cassidy: I’m gonna just assume that everyone turns and looks at Mikey?
Robyn: Yeah.
Amanda: [Chuckling] I think so.
Lilith: [Laughing]
Syd: Yeah, that’s a pretty good assumption.
Cassidy: What’re you guys looking at me for?
Robyn: Can you talk to animals?
Cassidy: No! Of course not. Animals can’t talk!
Amanda: Well, you can set your hand on fire, so y’know, we thought we would just check. Um, alright, I-
Cassidy: I guess I see the logic in that.
Amanda: I address the rats in… the common tongue, I suppose.
Lilith: [cackles]
Amanda: WHAT!?
Syd: The rats?
Lilith: I mean, in English, yeah… Yeah, yeah that’s fine.
Amanda: I dunno, I was looking at the list of languages that I speak and… I-, Okay, Okay. Alright-
Robyn: Galactic basic.
Amanda: Well, I don’t know if there’s like some Dr. Who shit going on where we can just speak whatever the language everybody else is speaking here. Like if we were in France we’d just be chillin’ too, but like alright. I am going to address the rats. In English.
Lilith: Ok. [snorts]
Amanda: [Bursting into laughter] I forgot what I was going to say, ok, great. Now that we know what language I’m speaking… What do you want?
Lilith: They just, they kind of skitter around.
Amanda: Fucking of course they do.
Robyn: Ah, the ‘normal’ rats.
Amanda: They skitter around? They were sitting still a little bit, before.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah, one of them kind of just goes over to a thing of cheese and … There’s cheese!
Amanda: [snickers]
Syd: Wait.
Cassidy: There’s just some cheese lying on the floor?… No wonder they have rats. Jesus!
Amanda: Rats love cheese.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah! There’s car cheese and the dragees so these rats are eating like- You notice, they’re a little bit bigger!
Cassidy: Oh, I forgot about dragees.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah. They’re a little bit bigger than your average rat.
[various murmurs]
Cassidy: Well, a diet of dragees will do that.
Amanda: Would you go so far as to say that they’re rodents of an unusual size.
Lilith: [Laughter] I- I wouldn’t, but I would say-
Syd: I get that reference
Lilith: Let’s all stop beating around the bush, they lunge at you and let’s roll for Initiative…! Yaaaay.
Amanda: Oh god. Jesus. Thank you. [Groans and Rolls Dice] I got 14.
Syd: I got a 20. Ok.
Cassidy: I got a 12 for my Initiative.
Amanda: Yeah I got fourteen.
Lilith: Electra was a twenty…
Syd: Yep… “Natty Twen”
Lilith: I like your… Are we gonna be starting some new tabletop lexicon like, are we coming up with some words? Hell Yeah.
Syd: Yeah, that’s… That’s my original. Y’all can use it.
Amanda: Get some knuckle tats that say “Natty Twen” on ‘em… It’s gonna go down real well.
Lilith: [Laughs] Uh, Robyn, did you get an Initiative roll?
Robyn: Oh, yeah, 12.
Lilith: Twelve, cool, alright. So there are three rats, and they’re all kind of poised on the shelves.
Cassidy: Like regular sized rats?
Lilith: Yeah, I mean they’re a little bit bigger.
Cassidy: But it’s not unusual.
Lilith: I mean, it’s slightly unusual.
Amanda: They’re showing a level of tactical organization that is unusual for rats, I’m assuming, yeah…? Gotcha
Lilith: Yeah yeah, I mean, they’re coming for you but Electra you’re going first.
Syd: Where, which shelf?
Lilith: It’s like, eye-level?
Syd: Ok. I’m just gonna swing at ‘em. I still have my bat after that last incident.
Lilith: Holy Shit, yes, absolutely. Swing at ‘em, roll to hit.
Syd: Just take a wack at ‘em, with the ol’ trusty Wendy.
Amanda: Oh god.
Syd: So that’s a… Is Electra a lefty? Probably. Sure. Why not?
Amanda: Aren’t we all lefties out here, really, deep down?
Syd: Yeah. Left Path, etc.
Lilith: Yeah.
Syd: Just swing from the left, so I guess the left rat’s gonna get it.
Lilith: Ok.
Syd: [Dice Roll] That’s a 23.
Lilith: That’s a-… Jesus, yeah, that hits. Uhm, yeah, roll for damage.
Syd: [Dice Roll] That’s a 6.
Lilith: That’s a six? Ok. You just like… that was, oh my god. That was Babe Ruth in the final inning. Like, you just launched that fucking rat. And it is G-O-N-E gone! Petua… [restraining giggling]
Amanda: Well I’m so glad that my thing won’t seem like overkill now. I cast Chill Touch [Laughter].
Lilith: [Laughing] Oh god, you cast Chill T- Okay. Is that a Saving Throw?
Amanda: It’s a Cantrip. No, I think-
Lilith: Yeah.
Syd: Oh, Chill Touch? That’s a good one.
Amanda: Yeah Chill Touch it’s a… It’s a good ‘un. Uh, I don’t think so, I just have to see if it’s a hit or not. So I’m going to see if it’s a hit!
Lilith: Ok.
Amanda: [Rolls Dice] And that is a… It’s a 16!
Lilith: Sixteen? That is a hit.
Amanda: Well, uh, a hit. Target takes 1d Necrotic damage and uh, can’t regen any hit points starting the next turn and- There’s an undead hand clinging to this rat, is what I’m saying.
Lilith: Well you that, I’m glad you did that. Because these rats are renowned for their healing arts. So that was gonna be a real problem!
Amanda: [Rolls Dice] I meaaaan uh… I do 4 damage.
Lilith: OK. That rat just kinda keels over. Like you overfed it, just… and it… There’s One Rat Left. Kevin! It’s your turn.
Robyn: I-I just, I hit it with my sword!
Lilith: Ok! Roll me an Attack Roll.
Robyn: OK cool that’s a 14?
Lilith: Fourteen? Awesome. That hits, and now you roll that d6.
Robyn: Now the d6. And that is 6 damage!
Lilith: Six damage, ok, that rat, that rat has been cleft in twain. Um, yeah, yeah. It’s gross, honestly! And so yeah, now y’all have three dead rats. [Breaks into the Final Fantasy battle victory theme]
Amanda: And where are the Other rats doing?
Lilith: No that was, there were three rats.
Amanda: Wait, you said that there were LOTS of rats, in there.
Lilith: I mean three is a lot of rats!
Amanda: That’s a very normal amount of rats! I thought, I was expecting, I was thinking like we just entered the Bat Cave and they’re just like LINING THE WALLS. The Rats. Really!
Cassidy: Yeah I was like-…
Lilith: [Laughs] I’ve seen Three Rats in my whole life, three rats is a lot!
Amanda: [Laughs] This is a fantasy role-playing game!
Cassidy: I think I’ve got three rats in my bedroom, right now.
Amanda: Yeah, same!
Lilith: Ok, fine! I-
Robyn: I imagined like…
Lilith: Yeah yeah, y’all like fighting rats so fucking much!
Amanda: Oh my god…
Lilith: You’ve got more rats! Mikey, it’s your turn there’s 3 more rats.
Cassidy: Whose turn is it?
Lilith: It’s Mikey’s turn.
Cassidy: Oh ok, where are, what are the rats doing?
Lilith: They just climbed up on that same shelf and they’re just sitting there looking menacingly. ‘Cause you just killed three of their brethren.
Cassidy: Ok. [Rolls Dice] So they’re just sitting there then?
Lilith: I mean, yeah, ‘cause it’s not their turn yet.
[Assorted Snickering]
Cassidy: Oh, OK. Well I just like, I don’t know, Three Rats is like, not a combat encounter… I dunno I guess I’ll attack one of the rats. I mean, I don’t have a weapon or anything so I’m just gonna… swing at it?
Lilith: Like, punch a rat.
Amanda: [chortling] Punch a rat.
Cassidy: I mean, I don’t even think Mikey would necessarily strike with like, closed fist? I’m sort of just imagining like a… Like a spastic kind of palm strike?
Amanda: S-So what you’re saying is, we should change the name of this podcast to “Rat Slapper”.
Lilith: Yeah! Yeah.
Cassidy: I mean, I’m not saying that but… I’m saying that’s definitely more what Mikey’s doing than like-
Robyn: My tattoo is actually for a band called Rat Slapper.
[Assorted Laughter]
Lilith: That’s, I-… I want the magic element of Kevin’s tattoo to be that this band keeps changing their name, and it just keeps changing with it.
Amanda: Oh God! That’s very good.
Robyn: Definitely… Every time he thinks of a cool phrase it changes.
[More Laughter]
Syd: It’s honestly a pretty sick power.
Amanda: I know…
Lilith: Yeah, right? So, Cassidy, what’s the Attack Roll for-
Cassidy: I got a 15 on my Attack Roll.
Lilith: OK, you slap the shit out of that rat. What is the damage on an unarmed strike? I think it’s just a d4?
Cassidy: I got… Well, plus my strength modifier?
Lilith: Yeah, yeah!
Cassidy: Uh, then I got 6 damage.
Lilith: Six damage, OK. Mikey, the rat just like… Kinda goes, flying. I dunno, what, was Mikey going for more of a ‘squash’ or more of an ‘away’?
Cassidy: Nonono it’s more of just like a swat. Like it just, y’know, sent it sailing straight across the room.
Lilith: OK.
Cassidy: It’s probably even fine, realistically? It just probably doesn’t want to play anymore.
Lilith: There’s two rats left and it is now their turn. One of them bites Mikey on the hand and… Oh! It just rolled a 20. This rat’s really good at biting. It just did 3 damage to Mikey.
Cassidy: Damn.
Lilith: Yeah! I mean it did roll a Crit so like… Good job, rat. And the other one like, jumps at Kevin? Tries to bite him, and it misses! Yeah, it just kinda, faceplants on the ground. But then it kinda skitters back up to its feet and runs away. We’re back to the top of the order, Electra there is one rat that ran away and there is one rat that just bit Mikey on the hand.
Syd: Is that rat attached to Mikey’s hand?
Lilith: No, the rat did not try to latch on.
Syd: Then I will swing… yeah, then I will swing at that rat. [Rolls Dice] 23.
Lilith: OK, the rat’s dead like-
Amanda: [Laughter]
Syd: That’s awful man.
Lilith: [Laughs] OK, all of the rats are dead. We’re past the rats. You solved my rat puzzle, congratulations.
Amanda: Oh my god…
Syd: We should investigate that corner, again… I’d rather not this time.
Lilith: So… Ok. Yeah you look back at that corner, the caution tape is still up. And you look at it and actually getting the same, like… Before the vibes, I know I keep using that word, but the vibes were concentrated over there, but they don’t really seem to be over there right now.
Syd: Where are they then?
Lilith: Well, you’ll have to find out, won’t you?
[Dice Rolls]
Amanda: Mikey- Oh, sorry… Electra, you were rolling an Arcana Check or something? Investigation?
Syd: I was making an assumption of what I have to roll…. So
Amanda: Oh.
Lilith: I mean, you can roll an Arcana Check here, yeah.
Syd: So that was a 13.
Lilith: Thirteen? You feel…. It’s nothing directional, but you do feel a prickle on the back of your neck
Syd: There’s definitely something still here. It’s just not, quite… there. Where it was before.
Amanda: I, okay. Mikey?
Cassidy: Yep?
Amanda: I think that you should look again. I think this will go faster if we have you looking for whatever is out there. Do you think-
Cassidy: Oh I don’t think I can do that again. No.
Amanda: You don’t think you can do that again?
Cassidy: No, I’m way too tired. I can only do that like, y’know, maybe a couple times a day.
Amanda: No, alright. Hm. Well-
Cassidy: And after healing Electra too like I just… don’t got it in me.
Amanda: No, no, that’s ok, I understand. Alright. I guess, should we…. Does anybody else have anything that would help us search for whatever this thing is? Or should we just go back out and look around?
[Faint Feedback starts, soon developing into Creedence Clearwater Revival played from another room]
Lilith: You hear the crackle of a radio turning on. And you hear from well behind you, it looks like it’s coming from the area where the garage is, you hear the fabled words of John Fogerty ringing out. He seems to hear that a bad moon is rising.
Amanda: God….
Lilith: Yeah.
Syd: Oh boy.
Amanda: Well, I guess, going towards that. Anybody else want to do anything else besides go towards that… music?
Syd: Trouble’s on the way….
Robyn: [With a nervous chuckle] Seems hard to do anything else, in this situation. I’m pretty curious.
Amanda: Alright. I think that we all run out, I mean, I dunno, I’m speaking for myself. I think I run out towards the garage, does anybody else want to come with me?
Cassidy: Mikey advances tentatively, staying behind at least one or two other people.
Amanda: Alright, yeah, no, I’m just gonna go into the shit, I guess. I’m probably in the front of the group.
Lilith: Ok, Ok. So you walk in, you burst into this fucking room and… You just see the radio, it’s an empty garage. Both the garage doors are closed… And yeah, you are… Whatever fucking vibe, you were feeling? It’s just like going absolutely like, you feel-
Syd: Bonkers.
Lilith: Yeah, it’s going bonkers, exactly. But you don’t see anything! Other than this radio.
Amanda: Alright.
Syd: That’s what I say, Electra just says ‘Bonkers’ as I enter the room.
Amanda: Um, hear me out… if they can hear me over. This is the radio, hopefully. I turn to the other three, I say: I think, I’m not sure if the rats were involved in this, but I think the radios were. And I think every time that we destroy something that has this in it, it moves. So… Maybe we should proceed with caution and not smash it immediately if we can avoid doing that, yeah?
Syd: Sounds like a plan.
Cassidy: Ok!
Amanda: Right.
Robyn: Fair enough.
Amanda: I guess, can I roll an Arcana Check?
Lilith: Yeah, sure, go ahead.
Amanda: And that’s a… ooh! 17.
[Radio Music Cuts Softly After Roll]
Lilith: Seventeen? Ok… Yeah you feel… There’s something underneath you, you feel some deep like, Necromantic shit going on… It seems like it’s coming from underneath one of the lifters?
Amanda: Alright… I look around. I think it’s coming from underneath one of the lifters!
Lilith: [Laughs]
Robyn: I’m assuming Kevin knows how a lifter works.
Lilith: Yes, absolutely he does. There’s a lever that makes it go up, and makes it go down.
Syd: Nice.
Robyn: Let’s make it go up.
[Dark Ambient Music slowly enters the mix]
Lilith: Ok, ok. You make it go up and this lever, this lifter, you see it kinda looks like in a cartoon, the way that cheese sticks to the roof of a pizza box? You know what I’m talking about?
Amanda: Wait, in what cartoon does cheese stick to the lid of a pizza box?
Robyn: It was in A Goofy Movie, right?
Lilith: Yeah, it probably- Yeah! Yeahyeahyeah
Cassidy: Didn’t Ninja Turtles have that effect?… You’re just talking about like, really gooey cartoon pizza.
Amanda: Ohhh Ok.
[Music Builds into Tense Metal]
Lilith: Yeah, really really gooey cartoon pizza, but it got stuck to the top? And it’s just like, you just see… that, but a lot pinker than cheese. You just see a kinda goop rising up, and suddenly you just see like, it almost looks like an arm reaching out from the goop and it lunges at Kevin. It tries to hit him in the face and is not successful. But now we’re rolling Initiative again!
Syd: What. The Fuck.
Lilith: Electra you’re at the top of the order. What’re you gonna do?
Syd: Oof. This is the big moment. Gonna bust out Dissonant Whisper.
Lilith: Hell Yeah.
Syd: Yeah there is no Attack Roll. It’s just a Wisdom Save.
Lilith: Oh it’s just a Wisdom Save? Ok, ok.
Syd: Yeah.
Lilith: Uh… OK so then it does not successfully save.
[Sound Effects]
Lilith: Hell yeah, what do these beautiful tones do?
Syd: Target must make a Wisdom Saving throw, on a failed save it takes 3 d6 Psychic Damage and must immediately use his reaction… if available.
Lilith: Fuck Off! Damn Ok… !
Syd: … use his reaction, if available, to move as far away it’s Speed allows, away from you.
Amanda: Goddamn.
Syd: It doesn’t move to obviously dangerous ground. Uhm, yeah.
Lilith: OK, Ok. R-Roll that… [Dice Rolls] Wait, you have a level one Bard Spell that does like 3 d6 damage?
Robyn: Ouch.
Amanda: Yeah, shit.
Syd: Yeah Dissonant Whispers is dope. [Dice Rolls] So that’s a 6… 8… 9. That’s about 9 Damage. So not a whole lot but, it has to fuckin’ flee.
Lilith: OK…. Yeah, yeah, it super does have-… So it kinda recoils away from you. It takes all that damage and then it just kinda like slides beneath the lifter and just kind of, you just kind of see it flow across the ground away from you? And it’s about 30 feet away… Kinda coiled up in a corner. And it is Petua’s turn!
Amanda: Alright, I think that I’m going to cast Eldritch Blast again.
Lilith: Hell Yeah.
Amanda: Love it! Alright, I… [Rolls Dice] Oh! That um… plus 5, so 16!
Lilith: Sixteen hits!
Amanda: Alright, I roll that one d10 force damage [Rolls Dice] Oh! Nice, 7.
Lilith: Seven, ok… Alright, another just, chunk is taken off of this blob which, you actually see it’s starting to kind of reform itself? It looks like sort of… just an incomplete pastiche of a human, like someone tried to put together… A very unskilled sculptor made this little pile of flesh. And Kevin! It is your turn.
Robyn: K, I’m scared of running up to it? And I don’t have any spells or nothin’. I think in this situation Kevin’s gonna just guard himself… Is that a thing I can do?
Lilith: OK!… Yeah.
Amanda: You don’t wanna attack it?
Robyn: I only have a sword! I don’t know, I’m scared if I…
Amanda: You should try and cult it in half!
Robyn: Just try to cut it in half? OK. Screw it, let’s cut it in half.
Amanda: Yeah!
Lilith: OK! You run up to it and you try to cut it in half. Roll that d20 to attack.
Robyn: That’s an 11.
Lilith: Eleven? That just hits. And so you roll the damage die.
Robyn: And that’s 1 Damage.
Lilith: One Damage. Ok. You just, like, take a little sliver off. Just about enough to make a Starburst.
Robyn: Alright…
Amanda: Tasty…
Lilith: And now it is Mikey’s turn.
Cassidy: So it’s just like… basically pressed up against a wall in fear?
Lilith: Mm-Hm!
Cassidy: OK, I do nothing then.
Lilith: Oh! Alright. Um…
Syd: So it’s just a blob with arms?
Lilith: Yeah.
Cassidy: I mean it’s not obviously trying to attack us anymore. If, even if, it was necessarily trying to attack us to begin with.
Lilith: Ok!
Syd: Hmm.
Amanda: It definitely tried to hit Kevin, but yes.
Robyn: It tried to, tried to, yeah.
Lilith: And it tries to do that one more time. It is successful, uh Robyn, what’s your character’s A.C.?
Robyn: 13.
Lilith: Thirteen, ok yeah, it is successful and it does… uh 4 Damage.
Robyn: Oh.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah. It just like, smacks like a weird… It definitely feels kind of rubbery as it touches you. But just like an uppercut into Kevin’s chin. And we are back to the top of the order. Electra!
Syd: Ok. I’m using Vicious Mockery.
Lilith: OK.
Syd: There’s no music, it’s just the power imbued within me…. Since it is a Cantra, so….
Lilith: OK. I am feeling that power. I do, since it is Vicious Mockery, I do want you to specifically say what it is you mock.
[Music Fades Softly]
Syd: Yes, right… You’re an abomination, and not even in a cool way!
Lilith: You see just like, an exaggerated cartoon frown just stretch across its face. And that does damage right?
[Assorted giggling]
Syd: Yeah if… if it fails, a Wisdom Saving Throw.
Lilith: OK… Actually looks like, what’s the D.C. on that?
Syd: Oh right… 12?
Lilith: Twelve? Ok. It does pass that.
Amanda: So you’re just very mean to it?
Syd: Yes.
[Music slowly fades back in]
Lilith: So the frown turns upside down. Again it just kinda weirdly, like…. Like somebody’s pushing it around with their fingers? It’s just like-
Syd: Wow.
Lilith: Yeah, yeah. It’s truly upsetting. Petua, it’s your turn.
Amanda: Alright, before I do anything else, I want to address it in the Demon Tongue. And I ask it-
Lilith: OK!
Amanda: Yeah. I ask it, “What are you, who sent you here?”…. Does it respond?
Lilith: Um, you just kinda hear… *growling noises*
Amanda: [Laughs]
Lilith: Which is not in Demon Tongue, by the way!
Amanda: No, but it definitely responded to me. Hmmmm. And I don’t understand the language, obviously.
Lilith: Yeah.
Amanda: I’m just going to yell at it one more time, though…. “Can you understand us?!?”
Lilith: They just, it just, you just kinda see… That hand that clocked Kevin in the jaw? You just kinda see it extend forth? In kind of a, it’s sort of like a Stretch Armstrong thing, where it’s kind of stretching across the room? And then you see, you don’t see ‘fingers’, you see one finger and it’s in the middle. And it just kind of raises up. Right in your face.
Amanda: Alright, if you’re gonna be like that. Great, great, Uh, hey! Other question! Really quick, can I assume this is the same entity that did damage to me through the speakers earlier? Or is that not the thing.
Lilith: I-it, yeah it is.
Amanda: Alright! In that case, I’m going to cast Hellish Rebuke.
Lilith: [Laughs]
Syd: Oooh shit. Nice. Hell Yeah.
Robyn: Fun name.
Lilith: It is a fun name. It’s a very fun spell.
Amanda: Yeah, alright. Here! I look at it, say “You know what? That is really unnecessary and I can point fingers too.” And I point my finger, and I- Oh god, let’s see if it hits otherwise that would really be all talk and no…. HA! Alright sorry that was great. It’s a 20, not a natural twenty, but with my stuff it’s a twenty.
Lilith: OK, ok, it definitely hits.
Amanda: Alright, I point my finger, and it is surrounded by flames and it takes 2 d10 Fire Damage.
Cassidy: So wait… You have shit talk so powerful that you can make things catch fire?
Amanda: Oh no, the shit talk was entirely additional, it was not necessary. Although, I do- Look, I will say that I, Petua, doesn’t look like she was- I think she was kind of talking herself into doing the spell as much as she was trying to shit talk this creature.
Lilith: [Laughter]
Amanda: If that makes any sense. Yeah, so, it’s surrounded by hellish flame… And that’s oooh! That’s 10…. And 13 Damage!
[Music Fades]
Lilith: Thirteen damage, ok! You see, just that arm that was like, reaching out to you? It just melts away like a fucking candle. And you see this thing, it’s just kind of on the ground, now kind of looking quite a bit more pitiful and less disgusting? But still very disgusting than when you started and suddenly you hear this rattling as both of the garage doors begin to open.
[Guitar Doors Whirr]
Syd: God.
Lilith: And all you can see behind them is bright white light.
Syd: Hmmm.
Amanda: That’s not supposed to happen at night.
Lilith: You see two green darts. One of them actually misses, the first one, but the second lands right in the neck region of the weird blob that you were fighting? And it kind of freezes.
Robyn: … Thanks!
Cassidy: Like freezes as in stops moving or freezes as is-
Lilith: It just stops moving!
Cassidy: OK.
Syd: … uh, can we see where it came from? Or at least track-
Lilith: It seemed to come from outside!
Syd: Hmm.
Amanda: Thanks for the assistance, but who the hell are you I guess?!? Should we ask?
[music starts]
Lilith: So, a woman in a beautiful white turtleneck-
Amanda: Nice.
Lilith: … walks out, yeah I knew that’d be all Petua’s jam.
Amanda: It’s SO her jam.
Lilith: Walks out from the light, she’s holding a gun in one hand. It kind of looks like a dart gun. And she is looking at the four of you, she’s not pointing the gun at you. And she says “… Hello? Who are you?”
[Various murmurs]
Cassidy: Hi I’m Mikey.
Lilith: Hi Mikey!
Robyn: I’m Kevin.
Lilith: Kevin.
Syd: Electra… and same question.
Lilith: Okay… Um, hold on. OK; Electra, Mikey, Kevin, fantastic. You! And she’s looking at Petua particularly interestedly, what’s your name?
Amanda: [audibly flustered] Um… H-hi. Um… M-my name is Petua. That was really great, what you just did there, that was really really good it was-
Lilith: Thanks!
Amanda: I did the, the earlier, yeah-
Lilith: Glad you were impressed.
Amanda: Yeah, no, very impressed. I did the other stuff that you saw earlier, that was me.
Lilith: Well, I wasn’t watching so….
Amanda: Oh… it was really good, trust me, so good…. Uhm, what’s your name.
Lilith: I believe you! I believe you. She offers out a hand to Petua specifically and she says My Name is Anja St. John. And her hand’s kind of held out there.
Amanda: I shake it enthusiastically. Anja! Very nice to meet you. Nice to meet someone who is alright with killing blobs, I guess.
Lilith: Well he’s not, that’s not… That’s not important. What are you doing here, again?
Mikey: We were following the truck balls.
[snorts]
Lilith: Ok, so we’re here for the same rea- Did somebody tell you to go after the truck balls?
Mikey: I mean, they all told me. I just kinda had a feeling that this was what I’m supposed to be doing.
Lilith: That…. I admire your sense of purpose in life Mikey. That’s really… admirable.
Mikey: Thank you! Mikey looks like he actually is taking this compliment very seriously.
Lilith: So everybody else, especially Petua, what… who… why are you here?
Amanda: Well, uh, well, we are… investigating a-
Lilith: You’re with Luci, aren’t you?
[Music promptly stops]
Amanda: [relieved sigh] Oh, thank christ, yes, we are definitely with Luci. Yes, that’s definitely who we’re with.
Lilith: OK… Ok… Hmm. That’s interesting. Didn’t know that her goons would be out here.
Amanda: Oh.
Lilith: Back up, back up, just… chill. You must be new, I haven’t seen y’all before. Again, Anja St. John, I’m with the Lazarus Foundation? If you don’t know who we are, that’s actually… quite probable. We spend a lot of money to make sure you DON’T know who we are, but… um, but anyway–
Cassidy: Well why did you tell us then?
Lilith: That’s a good question Mikey.
Amanda: [Laughs]
Lilith: Keep that- keep that mentality about you, it’s going to get you far in life. And she like–
Cassidy: Ok.
Lilith: [snorts] I really, I really like this kid Mikey. Uh, Petua? She actually pulls out a little business card, and it says on it “Lazarus Foundation, Anja St. John, Head of Security” and it has an email-address and a phone number. Petua, let me know um…. Just let me know, and she just hands you the business card. Then she just kind of turns and calls back, but she calls back to the lights… Alright, bag him, tag him, let’s do this bullshit. And two guys in HAZMAT suits come in, and they like trying to figure out how to get the kind of liquidy body into a bag. It’s very… there’s lots of pratfalls and really good physical humor that nobody can see right now.
Cassidy: I feel like a snow shovel is the right answer there.
Lilith: Anja is like, Mikey you’re so full of good ideas. Really, wow. OK, Mikey? Here’s another card. Here you go. Kevin, Electra?
Mikey: OK.
Lilith: You can get my contact information from those two I guess if you need to…
Syd: I don’t.
Robyn: I get it, Ok.
Amanda: Um, look, look, wait, hey. I think Petua incidentally, when Anja handed her the card I think I was like halfway into my wallet to give her mine and then I think better of it. But uh, I definitely went up to her and kind of nervously bobbing around whatever the two people are doing. I-I I don’t think can do that, I think that’s ours, right? That should be ours, you can’t just take it away!
Lilith: Oh, I absolutely can. That is an interesting misconception, Miss Petua, but no, no. Absolutely can’t do that.
Syd: How did you know about what was transpiring here?
Lilith: Mmmm. Hmmm. Good question, Electra. She’s now kinda helping shovel, into the bag.
Amanda: [sighs] Well, well look, if you’re not going to tell us anything at least take us with you!
Lilith: OK, Petua, as tempting of an offer that is, I am going to have to decline. You are… Hm, how do I… ? Hm… I guess it kind of depends on whose laws you’re following here, but you don’t have jurisdiction here.
Amanda: I-
Lilith: Tell Luci I said buzz off? Um… Aaaand, yeah. And she’s now gathered up all the things, all the blob parts into the bag and she’s carting it back outside.
Amanda: I kinda look back at Electra and Kevin like, Are you cool with this?
Syd: No.
Robyn: No, but I’m not sure if we have much recourse here?
Amanda: [sighs] I… I…
Syd: Jurisdiction? Since when?
Amanda: I mean…
Syd: What does that even mean?
Amanda: I, I, y- [huffs] Mikey what do you think of all this?
Cassidy: I don’t think she likes you very much!
Syd: Well I don’t like her.
Amanda: Yeah…
Cassidy: She seems to like me.
Amanda: Yeah, she does. Well we all like you.
Syd: [muttering to herself] Lazarus… Lazarus…
Cassidy: Thanks!
Lilith: Mikey you’re doing a great job! That was just Anja just yelling out.
Amanda: [laughs]
Syd: Lazarus…
Cassidy: Thank you!
Amanda: I mean, look… If we fucked this up, I mean what if Lucifer never contacts us again? What if this was our last chance to, I don’t know, do right by this world, what we’re supposed to be doing? I don’t want to just let this go. What do you think we should do, should we run after her?
Syd: I think she’ll understa- well… She’ll probably be upset. But this is probably something that happens. I’m not happy about it. It’s very… unnerving.
[Soft music fades in]
Lilith: The lights all shut off, those lights that were outside, the floodlights? And you just see there is a nondescript 18-wheeler outside and Anja is in the passenger side seat. And she’s just waving through the glass as the 18 wheeler–
Cassidy: Mikey waves back.
Lilith: [Laughs]
Amanda: Petua kind of, I kinda wave back like, really weakly, as if I didn’t have any idea what my hand was doing like, bye….
Cassidy: Mikey’s on full-on like kindergartner meeting his mom on the first day of school kind of wave. It’s a whole body movement.
Amanda: [under her breath] God.
Lilith: The 18-wheeler pulls away and drives off into that warm Texas night.
[Skagos – Blossoms Will Sprout From The Carcass fades in]

(untranscribed lyrics)
It’s the fury of the storm
It’s the endless falling rain
It’s the growing of the dark
It’s the thrive of decay
It’s the voice of woe
It’s the call of the moon
It’s the cold retribution

"TRANSCRIPT - EPISODE 4
Uncle Stickey's House of Humours - vol I","(Transcription by Micha Cavaseno, contact for transcription work here)
[Music Fades In: Skagos – Blossoms Will Sprout From the Carcass]
Lilith: Previously, on Ghostpuncher Corps. Torment! Ear-splitting, mind-shattering torment.
Cassidy: OK well Mikey’s gonna push that button unless somebody stops him.
Amanda: Yeah… Coulda called that.
Cassidy: Like I’m walking towards the button right now.
Robyn: I’m fine with this.
Syd: I don’t… know that… we should touch that.
Lilith: It’s like a crushing wave of sound. Penetrating your skull-
Lilith: Ghosts were punched!
Amanda: Her eyes just kind of roll over and she closes them and listens for a second and then she summons this very very intense wave of Eldritch energy.
Syd: I’ve got my bat out, and I’m just
Lilith: Mystery abound!
Lilith: So a woman in a fucking beautiful white turtleneck walks out, yeah I knew that’d be all Petua’s jam.
My name is Anya St. John, I’m with the Lazarus foundation?
Lilith : So light your torches, ready your blades, and keep an eye out for peril. As we join the adventures of the Ghostpuncher Corps.
[Musical interlude]
Amanda: I slump down to the nearest sittable surface, looking kind of defeated…. Well?
Syd: I’m guessing this is some kind of opposition company. Which, given context is a very strange formatting but….
Amanda: Yeah… No, no shit.
Syd: Seems how this is.
Amanda: [sighs] Well?
Lilith: The uh, that radio crackles once more and you hear Luci’s voice on the other end…
“Uh… Hey guys, how’s it going?”
Syd: [sighs]…. Great.
Cassidy: Hm?
Amanda: Oh now she asks…
Robyn: Uh, the trucknuts aren’t a problem anymore if that’s…
Lilith: “That’s good!”
Robyn: Yeah.
Syd: However, Lazarus-
Lilith: “La-Lazarus! Oh, goddamnit. OK. Uhm… Ok, so. Hm. See that’s, I was tr-, honestly? OK. Hmmm. I guess I should let you in on a couple things. Kind of seems like you guys are pretty confused at this point. Um…”
Cassidy: I’m very confused.
Amanda: Yeah [indecipherable]
Syd: To say the least.
Lilith: “Mikey, that just seems kinda like a state of being for you and I- By the way, Hi Mikey. I’m Luci.”
Cassidy: Hi. I’m Mikey.
Lilith: “Hi Mikey. Um…”
Cassidy: Hi.
Lilith: Hi, uhhhh….
[slight tittering]
Cassidy: Hi.
Lilith: “OK, Ok, alright. Uh, so this is kind of why I- why I brought you in all uh…. I know it’s quite mysterious, maybe a little disorienting. You didn’t really know what was going on, but I mean, I had-…. I’ve had a number of teams out hunting for the same things that y’all have been hunting for. The uh, kinds of things. Aaaand, I’ve been having some problems with, um, I guess ‘Data Security’ is what we’d call it here. These goddamn motherfucking Lazarus pricks keep… doing exactly what I imagine they just did. They kinda did the whole contagion routine? Showed up, pew pew pew, and take the guy away, is that right?”
Syd: Yeah.
Cassidy: Oh yeah they took that bubblegum guy away, yeah.
Lilith: “Yes…”
Amanda: Yes, they… yes.
Lilith: “OK. Well… Hm. I’d say ‘don’t let them do that in the future’, but I know that’s kind of a big ask considering there’s four of you and it’s like, they’re a multinational corporation. Uh, hmm, OK. I’ll get back to you on what I want you to do the next time Lazarus shows up? But um-”
Amanda: [urgently] Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold on.
Lilith: “Yeah?”
Amanda: They’re a multinational corporation. We’re supposed to not let them- I-it seems like you two, pardon me, but it seems like you are, you have the same goal if our job-
Lilith: “Oh Absolutely Not!”
Amanda: So, what are they doing that we wouldn’t have done.
Lilith: “Hmm! Hmm. Hmm… I don’t know exactly what they’re doing? But uh, no multinational corporations have Very different interests and I uh, really don’t fucking trust them.”
Amanda: I, alright, I mean… So you don’t know what it is that they’re doing but you don’t trust them, but they’re killing the same things as you, is that about…?
Lilith: “That… That thing’s not dead.”
Amanda: Ah.
Lilith: “But now that everything’s kind of settled down with Lazarus, or uh with- with the blob, I’m just gonna let y’all mark one in the win column, for this? Nothing you can do about Lazarus, at least, nothing we can do right now. Um, soooo… Why don’t y’all, it’s the middle of the night! Have a nice little look around the uh, the shop that you’re in and I dunno, if you can steal something! I dunno. Anyway, peace!”
And then the radio crackles and turns off.
Syd: [whispered] Lazarus… who’s up top?
Amanda: Up top? You mean the CEO of Lazarus?
Syd: Yeah… How did they get this information? How did they get ANY of this information? About anything that they intercept.
Amanda: Well, I would really like to know that too, because if they’ve harnessed whatever it is that’s out there… I don’t know. And I think that Petua sticks the business card deep into her pocket and just kind of goes quiet.
Lilith: You look through Jackie’s Customs and you found a number of modifications for the winnebago that Kevin, you work through the night to attach to the winnebago. Does anyone wanna give me a summary, where did y’all land on what those modifications were gonna be?
Amanda: Alright. So, well, we chose updating our winnebago to go with Improved Tires which is a +2 to Vehicle Handling checks, a bagel-maker called the Winne-Bagel which produces 4 Bagels at the beginning of each day, each Bagel can be used each day to recover 1 d4 HP. The Fuzzy Dice, which is also a style play but it does 2 per day add 1 d6 per handling check. And then we’re also going with, because Elektra is very into it, the Exterior Mounted Subwoofer which allows bards to cast from within the winnebago at a x2 range. So we’re getting onto our Mad Max shit, basically.
Lilith: Yeah. Awesome.
Amanda: Yeah… it’s literally her jam.
Syd: That’s my jam.
Lilith: Now, while you were going around Jackie’s Customs, Kevin you did spot a corporate purchasing credit card just kinda sitting out on the desk.
Robyn: … Oh!
Amanda: [laughs]
Lilith: Did you do anything about that?
Robyn: Yeah. Yeah I [stammers] I put it in my pocket.
Lilith: Hell yeah you did, perfect. You’ve got that credit card.
Robyn: Nice.
Lilith: You can write that down… That may come up in the future! Um, so… You’re all set up. You all pile into the Winnebago with all of it’s new fancy modifications and you peel away from Jackie’s Customs; well in time to get away before they come back and realize that a bunch of their shit has been stolen and there was also apparently some weird play-doh fight in the garage last night. Let’s see! Who takes the wheel? I feel like Mikey keeps doing that but uh… yeah I don’t know!
Syd: There is the Jesus option.
Lilith: Um! [raps on wood] Jesus is actually, Jesus only gets included in the DLC so I’m actually gonna need like, 4.99 from y’all, if you want Jesus to take the wheel.
Syd: Gotcha.
Amanda: Oh god…. Did she tell us to come back? Did we like, were we ordered to report back or what?
Lilith: No, no, she actually said… I was actually asking about who took the wheel because, once you got in the car, once you started driving, the radio actually crackled on to life and she just kind of “Oh hey, just, real quick. I don’t have all the details for your next job quite nailed down yet, but just start heading to Arizona… K?”
Amanda: I mean it’s pretty big, is there a part of it you wanted us to aim for?
Lilith: “Well I mean you’re in Texas so-”
Cassidy: What’s an Arizona
Lilith: “Start… start driving left.”
[Radio Crackle]
Amanda: All right.
Syd: Did you say ‘What IS Arizona’ or ‘What’s IN Arizona’?
Cassidy: What’s Arizona.
Syd: Ok.
Amanda: It’s a kind of arid zone.
Cassidy: That makes sense.
Syd: … Holy shit. You just blew Elektra’s mind.
Amanda: [Laughs] Wordplay! Yeah, I think whoever’s least tired should take the wheel, we’ve all just had a big day. If anyone wants to drive, I don’t know, Mikey it seems your purview but if you want a break we can definitely chill out on that.
Cassidy: Mikey’s ok to drive.
Amanda: Alright Mikey. Then I guess Mikey’s driving to Arizona.
Lilith: OK. So, you’re driving to Arizona-
Cassidy: What does the Arizona look like? I’m imagining like a really big lizard.
Amanda: I mean, y’know, that’s not totally inaccurate.
Syd: Well….
Amanda: Well… it’s rectangular. And, I mean, on the map it’s usually kind of red, but I’m not really sure. Actually I haven’t ever been to Arizona so, I just kind of know what I’ve seen from y’know, images and stuff. I think you’ll-
Cassidy: Mikey is imagining a giant, fearsome red cube. This is the idea you’ve put into his head.
Amanda: [Snickers] Good.
Syd: It’s more trapezoidal.
Lilith: Is it?
Amanda: It’s sort of a general amorphous polygon. Yeah…
Lilith: Yeah… Ok, well, anyway-
Cassidy: Mikey doesn’t know what the words ‘amorphous polygon’ mean but they scared him.
[Assorted Laughter]
Amanda: I think that’s kind of a summary of the relationship between Mikey and Petua so far is that I just keep saying shit, and the fantasy just starts to unfold. All these terrifying words, alright.
Lilith: So you’re driving down the highway, and I need uh, all around the party I need Constitution saving throws.
[Assorted groans and dice rolls]
Amanda: [Nervous Laughter]
Syd: Nice, Nice. That is a… 19.
Lilith: OK.
Amanda: That would be a 5.
Lilith: OK.
Cassidy: Uh, 15.
Lilith: OK.
Robyn: And a 16.
Lilith: Sixteen, ok. Not to get too crass, or anything like that, but Mikey and Petua, you need to pee.
Robyn: Um…
[Assorted Snickers]
Lilith: And Mikey you spot on the side of the road, at the next exit, a big colorful sign for a “Uncle Stickey’s House of Humors”
Cassidy: I mean, as soon as Mikey realized he had to pee he slammed on the breaks.
[Assorted Laughter]
Lilith: Wait, just wait… Stopped in the middle of the highway!?!?
Cassidy: [nonchalantly] Yeah.
Lilith: OK!
Cassidy: From the perspective of everybody else, suddenly Mikey slammed on the breaks. Everything shifted, stuff fell over, the winnebago screeched to a halt. He opened the door and Mikey walked off the road, squatted for a minute, and then came back. And kept driving.
[Continued Laughter]
Lilith: [Chuckling] Okay!
Syd: Tha-that tracks.
Lilith: Yeaaaah… You know what that does….
Amanda: Yeah, that does track… I mean… I won’t be doing that.
Syd: Uhm, when you say ‘House of Humours’, is that spelled with a ‘u’?
Lilith: It IS spelled with a ‘u’!
Syd: So like, ‘the four humors’ as in.
Lilith: I mean-
Cassidy: No, that’s just how you spell humour.
Syd: Oh well there’s a- Ok. Wait is there a… Is both of them spelled that way?
Cassidy: They are here.
Amanda: Nah, I think there is ‘h-u-m-o-u-r’ right?
Lilith: Yeah, yeah.
Syd: Yeah, as The Four Humors.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Lilith: Which is also I believe just the… it’s–
Amanda: The British way of spelling it?
Lilith: Right, right, it’s one of those.
Cassidy: No it’s the correct way to spell it.
[Assorted Laughter]
Robyn: [Re-Affects the Twang] But we’re in Arizona.
Lilith: … What?
Amanada: I mean, are we? I don’t think we’re there yet.
Lilith: No, no, you’re still- You’re actually in New Mexico at this point.
Robyn: Ohhh.
Lilith: You’re, you’re poppin’ down–
Cassidy: Where’s the Old Mexico?
Syd: It’s down south.
Cassidy: Oh. That makes sense.
Lilith: So, I guess Mikey didn’t need to pull over to pee but uh, Mikey does take notice of this sign for Uncle Stickey’s–
Cassidy: What’s on the sign?
Lilith: Its… lot of bright colors?
Cassidy: Oooh!
Lilith: And it says “Uncle Stickey’s House of Humours” and
Cassidy: Mikey can’t read. Like, what’s on the sign, are there pictures?
Lilith: There’s smiley faces… And a seal with a little hat!
Cassidy: Cool.
Amanda: Oh that’s very good.
Cassidy: OK, Mikey excitedly points at the sign to everybody and asks y’all what it says.
Amanda: Ah, well, I guess it’s Uncle Stickey’s House of Humours, but I wonder if they have a bathroom, because I really have to stop.
Cassidy: I just stopped back there! Why didn’t you go?
Amanda: Uh, well, I mean. I probably could have but it’s not really my jam. There’s not enough, y’know, not enough vegetation around here to squat in for my personal needs. So I think the House of Humors is probably the best bet. Is there any way you could pull over Mikey?
Cassidy: Ok.
Amanda: Thank you.
Lilith: So you screech to a hall in the parking lot of Uncle– And I want to mention It’s spelled Stickey: ‘S-T-I-C-K-E-Y’…? Like the name not the adjective.
Syd: Yeah, it’s a surname… His Christian name.
Lilith: Yeah! Yeah it… Exactly. And it is a gas station/convenience store on one end and then there is just this, it’s built into the same building, but it’s this kind of nondescript- well…. I say nondescript but it is not especially stylized, but it’s very brightly colored in like, red and green and blue and all of those other colors too. It’s just fuckin… it’s just like, screaming with pigment at you. Uh, yeah!
Cassidy: Is that the Arizona?
Amanda: No, that is not the Arizona. If that was where we were supposed to hang out I don’t think I could handle it.
Lilith: Oh, and there is a sign outside that building that says “Uncle Stickey’s House of Humours”.
Amanda: Good.
Lilith: And there’s actually a restroom at the gas station side.
Amanda: Oh good, ok. Petua runs in there for sure… I mean, if that’s allowed. [Chuckle]
Lilith: Oh, absolutely. No first you need to get a key from the attendant–
Amanda: I mean do I need to make a piss check or what?!
Lilith: [laughs]
Amanda: Can I just go?
Lilith: No, you’re good, you’re ‘gone’.
Amanda: Good!
Lilith: I don’t wanna get TOO bogged down in that, I just wanted to get y’all off the highway.
Amanda: Ok, good.
Syd: This isn’t GURPS
Lilith: You’re outside Uncle Stickey’s. What do you do while Petua’s in the restroom?
Cassidy: Mikey just kind of gets out to wander around and have a look.
Lilith: Right on. Which, I mean, there’s just kinda… I don’t know if you’ve ever, well I actually know that you haven’t been in, just like, kinda middle of nowhere New Mexico but there’s just kind of dirt and bushes in most directions and um…
Cassidy: I’m from Alberta, I’m familiar with dirt and bushes in every direction
Lilith: They’re very, they’re a lot drier dirt and bushes. So….
Amanda: Delicious!
Syd: Oh dear…
Amanda: Ok, wait, hold on really quickly? This conversation made me have to pee, so I’ll be right back.
Lilith: Oh god, OK.
[Musical Fanfare]
Robyn: It’s literally just us right now? Yeah.
Amanda: Oh, dope, what happened?
Robyn: Uh, everybody else decided that now would be a good time to pee.
Amanda: Oh god, this is bad! We can’t have any more pee related plotlines in our podcast! Because otherwise, this could- This rich piss tapestry that Lilith’s going to be weaving for us is going to be making us go to the bathroom.
Robyn: Oh man.
Lilith: I came back to rich piss tapestry, that…
Amanda: [Laughs]
Robyn: That’s what your weaving for us!
Amanda: Its, you’re weaving a rich piss tapestry as I was saying…
Lilith: [laughs]
Amanda: I was saying if you’re going to continue weaving this rich piss tapestry for us, A: I really am happy ‘cause it means that I can keep saying that and it just rolls off the tongue but also there’s just gonna be a lot of Pavlovian responses here?
Lilith: I’ll just cut back in here? Uh, I talked about the characters having to pee and uh, about 2 minutes later we all needed to pee. Sooo uhm…
Amanda: Soo….
Lilith: Yeah.
Robyn: I did some fun stuff with my alone time. You might wanna leave it in, I dunno.
Lilith: OH–
Amanda: I don’t wanna, No. We don’t wanna know.
Robyn: I’m lying, I’m lying.
Lilith: [Laughs]
Amanda: OK Good. Whatever piss related stuff you did that didn’t involve going to the bathroom, we don’t wanna know.
Robyn: You’re right.
Cassidy: I came into this conversation at a weird point.
Amanda: [Laughs]
Lilith: I mean… There haven’t been a lot of great points to jump into this one to be perfectly honest.
Robyn: Oh boy. This has just been a weird conversation.
Amanda: Ohhhh…
Syd: Alright I’m back.
Lilith: Oh cool! Cool, cool, everyone’s back now. Awesome. Soo… Elektra, Kevin and Mikey. The three of you are outside um, Uncle Stickey’s. Yeah, whaddya do?
Cassidy: What’s the brightest, shiniest thing around?
Lilith: Uhm… There’s like, hm. You know what? Honestly, just because it’s the thing that gets a lot of use, there’s a doorbell? That’s the brightest shiniest thing.
Cassidy: I’ll go press the doorbell.
[doorbell rings]
Lilith: Ok, great. Great. And you hear from inside, kind of a ding-dong and…
Cassidy: I press the doorbell again.
[Doorbell rings]
Lilith: Oh and there’s another one!
Cassidy: Again.
[doorbell rings]
Amanda: [laughs]
Lilith: Oh, and there’s another one and–
Cassidy: Again.
[Doorbell Rings]
Lilith: Ok, a man comes out of the front door to Uncle Stickey’s and he’s: Oh. Y’know, I kind of expected someone younger! To be perfectly honest.
Cassidy: I press the button again.
[Doorbell Rings]
Lilith: Yeah, yeah, that’s the doorbell. Boy, what’s your name?
Cassidy: I’m Mikey.
Lilith: Hello Mikey, could you please stop doing that.
Cassidy: Oh ok.
Lilith: Wonderful! Wonderful, OK. Um, was there something you needed?
Cassidy: … No.
Lilith: Oh, ok. Um, do you want to come inside and have a look around?
Cassidy: Sure!
Lilith: OK! And he opens the door, gesturing for all of you to come inside. I’m gonna say, Petua, this is about when you-
Amanda: Yeah I was about to say, this is when Petua comes back around the corner, much relieved.
Lilith: You come in, and you find it… Have you ever been in a gift shop before? It’s one of those.
Amanda: Oh yeah… oh dear.
Lilith: The Same 18 shirts. Yeah, yeah. There’s a teddy bear hugging an American flag. Snow globes… Lotta, lotta r–
Cassidy: Mikey is fascinated with the snow globes.
Lilith: There’s one that has uh, the city of Albuquerque in it.
Amanda: Wait, the- Oh the- I forgot that were talking about snow globes, and so I was like ‘Wait, what?’
Lilith: [laughs]
Amanda: Is there that same rack that sells the same brand of incense that every single gift shop ever… ? Because that’s a thing, I don’t know if you know that that’s a thing… Yeah.
Lilith: Absolutely… Yeah, yeah there is.
Cassidy: I’ve never seen that in gift shops.
Amanda: Oh my god, every gift shop of every state park has the same brand of incense and it’s like a thing. Anyways…
Cassidy: Why incense, that’s so strange.
Amanda: Yeah, I’m not really sure. I mean, I think it might be a recent development but like, it’s become this kind of running joke with my friends that we buy this one specific thing of incense whenever we go hiking, I don’t know. I don’t know with incense after you’re sweaty and just have some snot-nosed kids you just took to like, a picnic. But I guess that’s the time for it, anyways.
Lilith: Yeah! Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lilith: So you look around, you see all these things. You also see a woman who is, you’re sure like… I don’t know how good everybody is at estimating heights but you’re like, ok, 7 feet tall at the very least. And she is built, and she is like–
Syd: … hhhi.
Lilith: …moving boxes and just kind of wearing like a sleeveless shirt. And the man who greeted you before who you notice he looks to be about in his 60s, he’s… he looks old, but kind of intense in a really weird way? His eyes almost appear dead at first glance but when you look into them, you realize that this man can peer into your soul with a fleeting glance.
Amanda: Do all of us just go up and look at him in the eyes and make that conclusion independently of each other or something…? Right, right.
Lilith: No no, it just kind of occurs to you… Yeah, yeah.
Cassidy: I think that’s a way, way bigger thought than Mikey is capable of having about another person.
Lilith: So, Ok, specifically for Mikey. Mikey, you, he, it literally reminds him of the man with the snow shovel from the first Home Alone movie.
Cassidy: Wait, what year did that come out? I don’t know if that’s within Mikey’s range of stuff that he’s experienced.
Lilith: Shit!
Syd: Was it like, ‘93?
Cassidy: Oh yeah, then it totally wouldn’t have.
Lilith: Oh goddamnit! OK–
Syd: 1990.
Cassidy: Mikey has been with the Sasquatches since 1990… yep.
Lilith: Since 1990. Ok, ok. Damn, OK. Well…
Cassidy: He was born in 1985 if anyone cares.
Lilith: I was born in ‘91 babe, I gotta pull these references uh… What is the 5 years earlier version of the guy with the snow shovel from the first Home Alone movie?
Cassidy: It’s– it doesn’t matter, let’s move on.
Lilith: Ok. Anywho, he stands behind the counter of the cash register and you see on the cash register a little like taped on, printed out sign that says “ASK ME ABOUT UNCLE STICKEY’S SECRET TEAMWORK TREASURE CLUB CHALLENGE”. Wow, I wrote that one and it took a grip to get it out. OK.
Syd: Wow.
Lilith: Yeah. Uncle Stickey’s Secret Teamwork Treasure Club Challenge, there we go!
Syd: Uh, Elektra’s interested in that… tall woman? Just as a, as a…
Cassidy: Interested in what way?
Syd: Well like, about what age would you say is…
Lilith: Uh, she looks to be, about I would say like… 30?
Syd: Ok. Physically attracted sort of way.
Cassidy: Mikey’s still looking at snow globes.
[Music starts to fade in]
Lilith: Welcome, welcome! Welcome to my House of Humours.
Amanda: Oh god…
Lilith: He’s kind of waving his arms around.
Amanda: The guy who let us in?
Lilith: Yeah the guy who let you in.
Amanda: Ah, a ‘house of humours’. Is that supposed to be about, are those things funny or what?
Lilith: Well, I mean, some of those postcards… they got, pretty good little ribs on ‘em.
Amanda: … do they?
Lilith: I- I assure you, they do!
Amanda: Petua walks over and picks up a postcard. Just doesn’t really break eye-contact.
Lilith: [Laughs]
Cassidy: Mikey’s looking at the postcards now too.
Lilith: Uh… Shit, now I have to come up with a postcard on the fly! Ah, fuck!
Cassidy: Mikey picks up one with a er… Bikini-Lady on it, which says ‘Wish you were her!’.
[Assorted Snorts]
Lilith: Thank y- Yes…
Cassidy: What’s this say? Is this funny?
Amanda: Petua looks at it. Uh… I mean it depends on what your definition of funny is but I’m gonna say no…. I mean, it’s just a postcard. Unfortunately.
Cassidy: Oh.
Petua: I kinda look back up at the guy. So, you sell… what here? I mean, is this place a destination around here, are there tourists around here? Or is this just a rest shop?
Lilith: Well it’s a, it’s a rest shop, a gift shop and well, it could be a whole lot more!
Robyn: So, is this like a Eyes Wide Shut thing, or… Scientology… ?
Lilith: Oh, uh… we don’t get HBO around here.
Amanda: Oh God.
Lilith: It’s just a little rest shop! We do have, we do have ‘Uncle Stickey’s Secret Teamwork Treasure Club Challenge’! And of course, ‘Uncle Stickey’s Secret Teamwork Treasure Club’, which you get entrance to as part of the challenge. The aforementioned challenge. Which I’m not gonna say it yet.
Amanda: Right. Is there an acronym you can start adopting or something? Anyways…
Lilith: [Laughs]
Cassidy: Woah, what’s an acronym? That sounds dangerous.
Syd: They can be.
Amanda: Oh. Yeah, sometimes they can be.
Lilith: It’s a way of shortening your speech and I love the sound of my own voice so, fuck that.
Amanda: Alright, well, it sounds like you- Wait a minute. I kinda look back at everybody, and then I look back at the guy. What is the nature of this club challenge?
Lilith: Ah yes, my humble treasure club, I’m so glad you asked.
Amanda: Well, you kind of led me into it, so.
Lilith: I-I feel that was very organic, actually! I feel there was–
Amanda: [Laughs]
Cassidy: No, you mentioned it like, four times.
Lilith: Alright, well! Uhm. [clears throat] At the beginning all participants are allowed and encouraged to purchase items from Uncle Stickey’s Treasure Chest. In order to join Uncle Stickey’s Treasure Club, you must pass Uncle Sticky’s Treasure Club Initiation Challenge, administered by yours truly and my darling niece Bernice. He points to the–
Cassidy: Are you Uncle Stickey?
Lilith: I am Uncle Stickey, that is. Yes…. Hello Mikey.
Cassidy: Oh, that makes sense…. I’m Mikey.
Syd: The tall lady, Bernice,.
Cassidy: Hello.
Lilith: Yes, yes. The tall lady–
Cassidy: Hello Bernice. Mikey waves at Bernice.
Robyn: H-Hey, what’s up.
Cassidy: I’m Mikey.
Syd: Elektra also waves at Bernice…. Hi.
Lilith: H-Hey.
Amanda: Well, alright. So we have a treasure chest…
Lilith: Yes. And the challenge–
Cassidy: Like a Pirate?
Lilith: Yes, very similar to a pirate. Except–
Cassidy: Mikey’s eyes light up.
Lilith: Yes. The challenge that you must endure as a team-building exercise, but I prefer to think of it as the ecstatic annihilation of the barriers between you and your teammates!
Amanda: …. I’m gonna go wait in the car.
[Assorted Laughter]
Lilith: If you pass, you keep your items, and you now have lifetime membership to Uncle Stickey’s Treasure Club where you will be able to purchase items from any one of my fantastic roadside attractions that pepper this damned nation.
Amanda: Ahhhh. OK. I think I see where this is going, alright. So y–
Lilith: And if you fail, you will be forced to surrender all of your purchases, by way of Bernice. I’ve taken a snap bracelet from a crying toddler, I don’t give a shit, try me.
Amanda: … That’s…
Syd: Elektra blushes.
Amanda: Yeah, nothing like manhandling children to really get it goin’! Uh, oh god, well, alright. I kind of shrug; I mean, we don’t have- I look back at y’know, Kevin, Elektra and Mikey. We don’t really have any supplies, I mean, and if we could avoid perpetrating credit fraud for as long as possible it might be worthwhile to see what this could, y’know, do for us? What do you guys think?
Robyn: We get 4 bagels a day right?
Cassidy: I wanna find the treasure.
Amanda: Yeah, man cannot live on bagels alone so, and I think Mikey’s into it. We should throw him a bone, he’s been really good about driving us this whole time so…
Syd: Treasure Hunts do sound good but… Yeah.
Cassidy: [Hyperactively] Like pirates! Like a parrot on your shoulder, or your hook hand!
Amanda: Oh yeah, definitely.
Syd: What was that movie, with Cyndi Lauper…
Amanda: Oh god. I definitely don’t know…
Syd: [sotto voce] I’m talking about Goonies but…
Amanda: Oh, OHHH. WAIT. HOLD ON, THE MOVIE–
Cassidy: Cyndi Lauper is in The Goonies?
Syd: She does a couple of the songs.
Cassidy: I did not know that.
Amanda: How is Cyndi Lauper your touchstone into The Goonies? That’s a deep dive.
Lilith: I mean I feel that that would be Elektra
Syd: Cause that’s Elektra…. Yeah.
Amanda: Oh it’s Elektra, alright, alright. That’s actually excellent alright. I’m sorry for ruining your character moment with my incredulity about Cyndi Lauper. Yeah. I mean, I- Yeah. I’d love to go, just like in that movie as well, to hunt for the treasure. If that’s ok with everybody.
Syd: If it doesn’t take too long I guess, we were kind of… on the way to… something.
Amanda: An indeterminate direction? Yeah, no, I think we’re good. I didn’t really sense urgency… Yeah.
Syd: Alright.
Lilith: OK… Well, so first I will allow you and I heard you mention Miss… What was your name again, Petua?
Amanda: Yes, Petua.
Lilith: Uhm, I heard you mention something about credit fraud. I hope–
[Nervous stammers]
Lilith: I hope things were okay.
Amanda: [Loudly] Oh that was actually a joke! No that was a joke.
Lilith: Oh… Got it.
Amanda: You should put it on a postcard, it’s very funny if you think about it for a very long time.
Syd: Ah! Metaphorical.
Lilith: And he just like moves over and he’s just writing into, he’s got like a word document that just says ‘Postcard Ideas’ and he just jots that down real quick: credit card fraud. I will find the joke later. As I was saying, in the beginning you are allowed to purchase items from Uncle Stickey’s Treasure Chest. You will still have to purchase them but you will have them available for use during your first challenge, and if you win, forevermore. And he hands you this laminated sheet of paper that has…
Syd: Ooh, laminated.
Lilith: Yeah. It has this list of gear and… Yeah, it’s got prices listed on there and you have your pick. I’ll let y’all peruse for a second.
Amanda: Oooh, I know what I want.
Lilith: Yeah, is there anything jumping out at you?
Amanda: Yeah I want those shades. Absolutely I want those shades. I mean they’re black, right?
Lilith: Yeah, they’re black.
Amanda: Yeah I want the shades.
Syd: Well then that confirms it for me, because that was my secondary pick! Can anyone guess what my primary pick is?
Amanda: Hmmm. Maybe the Compressor?
Syd: Yeah.
Lilith: Right on… Right on.
Amanda: Shocker.
Robyn: Kevin really wants the 4Loko.
Amanda: This is such- This is so good.
Syd: Oh sh- That Password Cracker though… Shit.
Cassidy: Is this just like a list of stuff?
Lilith: Yeah this is a list of stuff.
Cassidy: OK I–
Amanda: Petua goes over and reads it to, I go over and talk to Mikey. Hey Mikey, we’ve got some stuff here, the treasure that’s gonna be in the chest.
Cassidy: OK.
Amanda: I don’t know if I should do this out loud, over the podcast but I think Petua reads Mikey–
Cassidy: No I want you to, I want to hear what you’re telling Mikey. Like I want to know how Petua is phrasing each of these things.
Amanda: Alright. We’re doing this then.
Cassidy: ‘Cause, A lot of these words on these page, he’s not gonna understand.
Amanda: Alright. Well all of these items, in the pirate chest, right? Well they do different things. They can help us while we go around. So it looks like, there’s a collar. Have you ever seen a collar before Mikey?
Cassidy: Yeah. Yeah, like a dog wears.
Amanda: Yeah it helps you when you’re-… It stops things from hurting you.
Cassidy: Oh, OK!
Amanda: And um, if you eat a berry that hurts your stomach, it’ll help you out with that.
Cassidy: I don’t eat those berries, I know how to avoid them.
Amanda: Yeah. No definitely, uh, alright. And then there’s this electronic thing, I think Elektra’s probably going to want that, but it helps, it’ll help her to play her music a little bit better. Compressor, and it’s a steel battery powered effects pedal, and allows a bard to reroll on any one spellcasting roll. So there are some Night-Vision Goggles. Have you ever, I don’t know, when the sun goes down Mikey, if you can see still?
Cassidy: Oh yeah, I can see.
Amanda: Ok, so you probably won’t need those, but it’ll help you out if anybody who does. The other thing is though, if somebody tries to attack your eyes it’ll help you out there. So maybe that will be good ‘cause y’know, being able to see, that’s pretty good.
Cassidy: OK.
Amanda: Yeah. Then there’s oh let’s see, there’s a bandana, it’s a piece of fabric, it’s called the Real Tree Bandana. And it’ll be tied over, oh it’ll, well… OK. If you’re outside, right?
Cassidy: Uh-huh?
Amanda: And you have to sneak around, it might help you be a little more quiet.
Cassidy: Oh I’m really good at being quiet.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, and then there’s a drink! It’s called 4Loko, it’s the banned formula. There used to be a drink that–
Lilith: Hell yeah! [Chuckles]
Amanda: Yeah! And it’ll help you wake up if you pass out.
Cassidy: OK.
Amanda: Yeah and y’know there’s some other things that’ll happen but that’ll be the gist of it. And oooh! I think, Petua looks at the laser pointer, there’s a Laser Pointer!
Cassidy: What’s a Laser Pointer.
Amanda: Well it’s a dot. Um, Y’know, it’s a very very small light? And you can point it anywhere you want.
Cassidy: Mikey just looks at you totally blankly.
Syd: You can shoot it up into the sky and make airplane pilots crash!
Amanda: I think pulls out her, she has a wristwatch and she kind of lets it catch the sun? And the reflection just kind of darts around the ceiling of this place. Like that Mikey but smaller and red.
Cassidy: Oh OK.
Amanda: Yeah… And then there’s a pair of sunglasses, which I think I’m gonna get, and they uh, you see through illusions or anything that’s not real. Well, not really I guess but they’re gonna help me figure out if there’s anything that’s not right?
Cassidy: OK.
Amanda: And then there’s the uh, password cracker. Which, oooh, that could be interesting. So, this might not be your jam either Mikey but do you remember when we were at the police station and they had that computer there…? Yeah so this will help us if we ever need to break into any of those.
Cassidy: I mean, that thing didn’t look very strong. I bet I could break into it.
Lilith: [Laughs]
Amanda: Yeah, no that wasn’t one of the good ones.
Cassidy: Ohhh, OK. Like there’s bigger ones.
Amanda: Bigger… Well sometimes the better ones are actually smaller, which is pretty crazy, but yes. And then there’s some Body Oil which will help, uh, that might be good too. It’ll help you move quicker I guess, and uh you can’t, if you wash it off it doesn’t work anymore but yeah it’ll help you move more freely. And then, hmmm. There’s a… Pierre Pinkenelly’s Hammer. Petua kind of frowns at this one. It’s a hammer that is a, mm, I’m sorry. It, uh, it helps you… attack I guess. And I kind of look up from the list. Is that, sorry could you… ? I go over to the guy who was talking to us and I uh…
Lilith: Yes! Yes, was there something you needed?
Amanda: Uh, t-this hammer… that’s not really, what can you–
Lilith: Everything on the list is 100% guaranteed to be just as listed and 125% listed at manufacturer retail price!
Amanda: …. Really?
Lilith: Yes! These are the privileges you get when you join Uncle Stickey’s Treasure Club or whatever it was.
Amanda: So, so you’re telling me- Alright, wait.
Cassidy: I like to imagine that he just ended the sentence that way. Like, he just can’t even remember what he makes his own thing called.
Amanda: Oh god… So, Petua looks deeply disturbed by the fact that Pierre Pinkenelly’s Hammer is on sale for 249.99. And the list, I just have the list crumpled up in my hand and I say Um… While I definitely am in, do you guys, here… And I just hand the list to everyone and go quiet. Um, yeah. So that’s my jam right now.
Lilith: You can buy as many things as you want, there’s no limit… ! I mean, I suppose there’s a limit on your credit card but…
Syd: Oh, right… It is definitely not fraudulent.
Amanda: No. No!
Lilith: Yes. Your completely above board credit card!
Amanda: I, I think…. Yes. I might try and buy this one with cash actually. Paper trails… not really my thing for something this important. I want the hammer! And I also definitely want the shades, but the hammer… I just want to see it, do you have it here with you!?
Lilith: He brings the hammer out and he sets it down on the counter. Yeah, you can take a swing with it and you can do whatever you like. But y’know, gotta pay for it.
Amanda: Yeah. Petua just holds the hammer. Well! If you guys want to buy anything… go hog-wild.
Syd: Yeah I’m definitely into the Compressor and the Password Cracker.
Lilith: OK… Um, Mikey anything catch your fancy?
Cassidy: Mikey doesn’t really know what, despite having these things described, doesn’t have any real sense of what’s going to be useful, so… He’s just going to pass that decision on to other people.
Lilith: Mkay. And did anything pique Kevin’s interest?
Robyn: Oh I mean, he’s all over that 4Loko.
Lilith: Ok. Yeah, yeah. Um…
Amanda: Uh, I think that Petua gets him the Laser Pointer just so he can know what it is.
Cassidy: Can we- Can I ask why this laser pointer is SIXTY DOLLARS?!?
Lilith: [Laughs]
Syd: Very Powerful.
Amanda: It’s very good.
Cassidy: Is it like one of those extreme lasers, burns through paper, those kind of things?
Syd: It’s like 1, 1 watt.
Lilith: It’s, it is… it’s pretty good? But it’s very overpriced. So I’ve totalled up your total and looks like we’re going to be… It’s about uh, $769. Is that going to be cash or credit?
Syd: Nice.
Amanda: Credit.
Robyn: Credit.
Lilith: OK, OK. And he, I assume you pull out the store purchasing card?
Robyn: Of course.
Amanda: Uh, yeah but wait a second? I do definitely buy Mikey a snow globe also.
Lilith: Awwwww!
Cassidy: Mikey wants the one that has the most trees in it.
Amanda: Yeah.
Syd: Awwww!
Lilith: There’s one, this is just me editorializing here, but there’s a beautiful one with I don’t know if you’ve ever been in the forests outside of Santa Fe, just gorgeous. And yeah, there’s a snow globe, despite the fact that it doesn’t really snow a lot up there but, whatever.
Cassidy: I mean it doesn’t really snow up in Albuquerque either, but that was still the first one you mentioned.
Amanda: [Laughs]
Robyn: Kevin also buys a hand-picked stack of postcards.
Lilith: Hell yes, ok, cool.
Syd: Uh, what kind of pickled goods we got here?
Cassidy: Can I have this too? You turn around and Mikey’s got a novelty T-shirt which is just… a pug’s face, but over the entire shirt.
Lilith: [Chuckling] God…
Syd: Are there any of those rusty metal rifle that says “We Don’t Call The Cops”?
Amanda: Jesus.
Lilith: Oh, Jesus… So, yes to the pug shirt. Yes to the weird cut-out rifle because I know what you’re fucking talking about and those things terrify me. And…
Syd: They’re awful.
Lilith: Ok, OK, he’s totalled it all up its 869 dollars, it always just keeps ending in sixty-nine!
Syd: Nice.
Lilith: And so he says Could I have that credit card please?
Robyn: Yyyyep.
Lilith: Ok, so he takes the card and I… um… Kevin I need you to just roll me a d20.
Robyn: Ok…. That is a 5….
Amanda: Uh-oh..
Lilith: [wincing] Oooh…
Robyn: Hmmm. How am I gonna do this.
Amanda: Well, wait a minute, hold on one second!
Lilith: Yes.
Amanda: I have a very difficult time believing that between the four of us, none of us have any money, right? I mean, we must have something. We probably rolled for, I don’t know some sort of PP for dollar conversion rate? Is
Lilith: Yeah I don’t know, I don’t know…. It’s kinda, I mean, I would imagine….
Cassidy: I have this. Mikey reaches into his back pocket and just pulls out a leather wallet and hands it to you.
Lilith: Honestly? Ok. So I’m going through the party right now? And we’ve got ‘mechanic’, ‘raised by sasquatches’, and ‘Soundcloud musician’ so yeah, I would say that Petua is probably the only one who is Not flat broke.|
Amanda: Actually wait–
Cassidy: Well Mikey has all the stuff that was in the winnebago.
Lilith: That’s true.
Amanda: Oh, OK. I take the wallet from Mikey, and open it.
Cassidy: It’s clearly not Mikey’s wallet.
Amanda: Yeah, Um… What, ok, could I, could I play some… Yeah.
Lilith: Go ahead. Nonono, there’s a couple credit cards, couple… there’s a few 20s in there.
Amanda: Mhmm. Well, alright. I pull out one of the credit cards and hand it to uh, Uncle Stickey.
Lilith: Oh good, you have another card, because there was a problem with that. Here, Kevin, was it?
Amanda: Oh yeah. Yes.
Lilith: Here you go. You might want to call your bank about that one.
Amanda: Mm-Hmm. See that’s why we joke about credit fraud, because it’s happened to us, and we’re just trying to cope. Um, anyways….
Lilith: Oh, that’s very, very understandable.
Syd: Ohhhhh yes…. Yes.
Lilith: Oh jeez. Oh god. Ok just… Again, for the people at home, Cassidy just threw an image into the discord of a…
Cassidy: If any of you are familiar with themountain.com? That’s where you need to go for all your t-shirt needs.
Lilith: I will include a link in the description of the podcast where you can purchase that for 22 American Dollars.
Cassidy: That’s a fucking steal, and you know it.
Lilith: I mean….
Cassidy: That’s a lot of pug face for twenty-two bucks.
Lilith: It’s, it’s…
Syd: It’s a whole body!
Cassidy: That’s at least 50 dollars of pug face.
Amanda: It’s a very good pug face.
Lilith: I mean, if, if we’re just going pound for pound on pug face then yes, it’s a great deal. Amanda, I do need you to roll a d20.
Amanda: OK. Don’t fail me now dice-a-roni. [rolling dice] Ohhh! Do I add anything to it?
Lilith: Not that you know of.
Amanda: It’s an 18!
Lilith: OK! Ok. Oh, it looks like that transaction went through. Congratulations, here are your items. And he kinda distributes them out among you.
Amanda: I give the laser pointer to Mikey and tell him Don’t shine it in your eyes.
Cassidy: Ok!
Amanda: Continue.
Lilith: Now! In order to retain these prizes you must pass this Gauntlet of Challenges which I have for you are you ready for the Gauntlet of Challenges?
Syd: Wait… If the whole point is to retain our treasures, why did we have to pay for them?
Lilith: Yes. Yes.
Amanda: That was gonna be my question too, but I do think that, for some of these there’s a significant mark down to their actual value. Although value is kind of fake, but yeah that’s a good question.
Lilith: Well, I mean, they’re nice things they’re not… I can’t just give them out to anybody who passes the challenges, still have to buy them. You just, when you join Uncle Stickey’s Treasure thing you are… marking yourself as a higher status. Higher, uh, class of adventurer. And uh, so you get cool stuff. You get to buy cool stuff! Some people don’t even get to buy this cool stuff! I’ve had to take it away from people…
Amanda: Right. I mean I think we just DID buy it. I think we just did buy it is the thing, and you just handed it to us.
Lilith: Yes. Yes, that is correct. But as I said–
Amanda: That’s not a great… [snort]
Lilith: As I said before; Bernice WILL take all of your items away… if you do not pass these challenges.
Amanda: Ooooh I forgot about Bernice. Well, fine.
Syd: What’s Bernice up to?
Lilith: Hey!… Motherfuckers better not run. Got my eye on you. And she points two fingers at her eyes and then two fingers at Elektra.
Syd: Elektra giggles.
Lilith: I know your type.
Syd: [snorts and laughs]
Amanda: I think you ARE her type. Anyways… That’s what this podcast needed: dyke drama. Alright. I….
Cassidy: I mean I figured it was probably an eventuality.
Amanda: It’s inevitable, I mean you saw, I couldn’t use any words, I went full Agent Cody Banks when we met turtleneck woman last time. I hold my hammer and I put my… Actually, you know what? Fuck it. I put my sunglasses on, indoors, and I look at the guy and I say I’m ready. So let’s do it.
Lilith: This is a-, I wanna just really quickly, because it was never mentioned. Those sunglasses, again, when you put them on your whole world goes black and white. They are referred to as ‘Roddy’s Shades’.
Amanda: Mmm.
Lilith: And I…
Syd: Oh. Oh! Oh my god.
Lilith: Thank you. It’s a They Live–
Amanda: OH MY GOD! JESUS CHRIST. IT’S A THEY LIVE THING.
Syd: She got it…
Cassidy: Did y’all really not get that till now?
Amanda: No! ‘Cause I- Ohhhh, my goooood…
Cassidy: What else would that, like what other Roddy would that be?
Lilith: I mean… Not everybody thinks about They Live as the Roddy Roddy Piper movie, babe.
Amanda: I, well– I haven’t seen They Live!
Syd: Yeah, I didn’t… I just piece it together that name until just now.
Cassidy: I mean, I didn’t either, but…
Amanda: Ugh… yeah. Me neither. Jesus. Alright… Ohmigod so no, can we just break this down for just one hot delicious second?!?
Lilith: Yes.
Amanda: I’m wearing the sunglasses from They Live and holding onto Pierre Pinoncelli’s hammer that he broke, I mean- I don’t even know if I want to go into the quibbles of delicious that–
Syd: Oh! I just looked it up and I get it.
Amanda: Okay, cool. So that’s what we’ve got. Yeah.
Lilith: Ok, so, for the folks at home, like–
Cassidy: I don’t get that.
Lilith: Yeah, let’s, let’s all remember that this is a podcast that’s being recorded for human beings.
Syd: Yeah yeah.
Amanda: Yeah, alright– Well OK! Pierre Pinoncelli is a performance artist, conceptual artist… And the thing he’s most famous for is… You’ve all heard of the guy going up and punching a Monet but Pierre Pinoncelli did it first and for art reasons. And he took a hammer to Duchamp’s “Fountain” so- which is the urinal speaking of piss-related things. He did a lot of other stuff but y’know, the conceptual destruction of art pieces for art’s sake is his deal.
Cassidy: Yeah I just googled the name, he has a really really short wikipedia…
Amanda: Yeah.
Lilith: Yeah!
Cassidy: … but like so short that it’s actually intriguing.
Amanda: Yeah no I mean, in terms of like… I don’t know, like, clout in the art world? I’m not really sure. I don’t hear about him a lot, but… He’s out there! And he did try and bust up a Duchamp so that’s his game.
Lilith: OK, well, now that we’ve talked about the history of your items was there anything else that you wanted to discuss before we begin the challenge?
Cassidy: You got pants?
Lilith: Do I…
Cassidy: These ones don’t fit.
Lilith: I mean, I’m wearing pants. OH! Yes.
[Assorted Laughter]
Cassidy: While you were all talking, by the way? Mikey changed out of his oversized ‘dad’ button down and into the, although better fitting, still quite large pug t-shirt.
Lilith: We’ve got swim trunks. They come in two colors, both of them are horrible but we do have something in your size Mikey. And he hands you, just like… it’s… it’s a little too neon to be Pepto Bismol pink? But it’s just like that, but turned up a little bit. And then yellow.
Cassidy: What is it? Like a pair of swim trunks?
Lilith: Swim trunks. And yeah they’re pink and yellow.
Cassidy: Ok. Mikey starts unbuttoning his pants.
Amanda: Ohhhh alright.
Syd: Wait–
Lilith: Oh, oh. This is…
Cassidy: He’s taking them off.
Amanda: I do not have a safe–
Lilith: Stickey’s After Dark!
[Assorted Laughter]
Cassidy: Pants are down.
Amanda: Now we know why it’s called Uncle Stickey’s. Alright…
Syd: Oh lord.
Amanda: And I just, for the kids at home, I really feel it’s not in Mikey’s character to wear underwear but I could be wrong about that.
Cassidy: It’s totally not.
Amanda: Yeaaah.
Syd: Oh noooo.
Cassidy: Mikey doesn’t even know that underwear are a thing that exists.
Amanda: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright, Petua looks in the other direction.
Cassidy: Ok, the swim trunks are on.
Lilith: Oh, mmmm…
Syd: Sir, I apologize.
Lilith: We do have a bathroom. I just… wow.
Syd: Yeah…
Cassidy: I don’t like these. He’s kind of tugging at his crotch weirdly.
[Assorted Laughter]
Amanda: Oh my god…
Cassidy: He starts taking them off.
Lilith: [chortling]
Amanda: Oh god… Ahkay… Jesus Christ.
Syd: Do you have a bigger size?
Lilith: [Stammering]
Cassidy: The pants are back on now.
Lilith: Ok, Ok.
Amanda: Good.
Cassidy: No thanks.
Amanda: [Hurriedly] OK, I turn to Uncle Stickey. Please, for the love of God let’s start before anything else happens… like that.
Lilith: Mmm. Yes, that’s probably for the best. And he leads you to a door that goes down… You notice, it’s a stairwell going down, underground. It looks kind of dark down there. Can’t really see what’s down there but he gestures for you to walk ahead of him, down the staircase.
Syd: This is not suspicious… or weird. Not at all.
Lilith: No I wouldn’t say it’s suspicious or weird at all! Me and Bernice we run a… a tight ship here, don’t we?… Yeah, alright Uncle Stickey.
Amanda: Oh is Bernice following behind us I’m assuming?
Lilith: Yeah yeah, part of the challenge. Don’t worry about it.
Amanda: Yeah it’s… great.
Syd: Oh, ok.
Lilith: You go into this, and you actually had to go down quite a bit of ways. Welcome to the challenge course everybody! You’ll see we have here our first challenge, which should be The Great Wall of Friendship! And you see a 25 foot high wooden wall. And he says Well, so as with most walls your challenge here is to get up and over that wall but uh, there’s a little twist! My darling, darling niece, Bernice, will be standing at the top of the wall. And she will try to punch you in the mouth if you come to the top of the wall…. So, figure that out.
Amanda: Wait, h- could you run that down, I’m so sorry, one more time for me?
Lilith: There’s a wall. There’s a Bernice on top of the wall. She will punch you if you get on top of the wall, you need to get over the wall.
Amanda: … Right. And just to make sure, I mean, what are the, uh, rules here? Are we functioning as normal law-abiding citizens? I mean, I don’t really want to hurt your niece but like, how tough–
Lilith: You can try, jeez, oh my god. Look, take your swings, I’ll be fine… Uh, I assure you, Bernice is uh, quite, quite weathered. She can handle whatever you throw at her.
Amanda: [Resignedly] Alright. I mean, I’m down for that. Alright…
Robyn: Is it at all possible to walk around the wall?
Amanda: [laughs]
Lilith: Well, that… It is possible, you don’t–
Cassidy: I think he said we have to go over it. I don’t think that counts.
Robyn: [sighs]
Lilith: You have to go over it! It’s a rule of the challenge.
Robyn: [blows a raspberry]
Amanda: Alright. Well… I guess, I guess we’re gonna go up the wall then. Um, hold on one second, sorry….
Lilith: Bernice is now seated at the top of the wall, and she is just kinda looking down at all of you.
Amanda: [Rustling Papers] Does anybody have a Grappling Hook? And by that I mean, does anybody have an Adventurer’s Kit which would have a Grappling Hook in it?
Syd: Uhhh…..
Cassidy: What kind of wall, is this just like a wood wall, with no hand-holds or anything…?
Lilith: No handles, no.
Amanda: And approximately how tall is it?
Lilith: Twenty feet.
Cassidy: Do we have to ALL get over it?
Lilith: Yes.
Cassidy: OK!
Lilith: Yes it’s teamwork! You ALL have to get over the wall!
Robyn: I have rope, but not a grappling hook.
Amanda: Alright, well that’s something at least. Um… Okay. Hold on one second. I mean, does anybody have any ideas?
Cassidy: I mean I could carry you.
Syd: Well that was nice of you.
Amanda: Well… That’s a good idea Mikey, but could you climb up the wall?
Cassidy: Oh yeah. Maybe not like this. Or, not like this and carry you at the same time.
Amanda: Right. Well, Mikey, I mean you don’t have to carry us if you could get over the wall, uh, you could take the rope with you and hang it over the wall. Then the rest of us could come up.
Cassidy: … Oh, ok! I can do that.
Amanda: Alright!
Robyn: I also have, I just googled this because I didn’t know what it meant previously, I have a piton as well, I got a piton.
Syd: Piton?
Cassidy: Pitons. They’re like, climbing.
Robyn: Yeah.
Lilith: I think Mikey is the man of the hour. Let’s hear what he’s gonna do!
Cassidy: Ok, so you pass Mikey the rope.
Amanda: Mm-hmm?
Cassidy: And then… Something happens which is deeply disturbing. From a mechanical aspect, this is Mikey’s first use of the Wild Shape ability to turn into a gorilla.
Syd: Oh!
Amanda: Ahhh! I love it, love the concept!
Cassidy: But, that’s not really what it looks like as far as this world goes? This is more like some Altered States evolutionary regression kind of stuff?
Syd: [Less Appreciably] Oh… Ohhh Jesus.
Cassidy: So… Just some sort of fucked-up Gorilla-esque human ancestor is what you’re seeing? But wearing Mikey’s pug t-shirt.
Amanda: Do the swim trunks rip off, Incredible Hulk style?
Cassidy: Well he’s not wearing the swim trunks anymore.
Amanda: Oh right right, he’s wearing the– Ahhh…
Cassidy: They bunched and, it was the netting. It just wasn’t…
Amanda: Yeah, that’s not good. Alright.
Cassidy: But anyway that gives me a Climb speed of 30 feet a round? So I feel that’s enough to get over this pretty easily.
Lilith: Ok! Ok.
Amanda: Holy shit.
Lilith: That is… fucking amazing. I just [clears throat] On an unrelated note, this is just what Mikey’s doing. I just wanted to state on the podcast: I LOVE MY WIFE. Um, anyway!
[Assorted Chuckling]
Lilith: Mikey, you, in this horrifying gorilla-human… Uh…
Cassidy: I’m sort of imagining it to be like an orangutan but without the hair?
[Various Noises of Horror and Disgust]
Cassidy: Like something distinctly inhuman and apelike? But doesn’t cleanly correspond to any ape you’ve ever seen in your life.
Amanda: So kind of like if you look at those charts of which prehistoric creatures got left behind by the path of evolution and don’t exist anymore? Yeah.
Cassidy: Yeah.
Amanda: Alright.
Syd: [shudders]
Lilith: Ok, Ok, there’s some fucking missing link shit going on here.
Amanda: Mm-hmmm!
Lilith: And so this, this thing jumps up. Climbs up the wall and Bernice is a little-bit taken aback. But uh, as you climb up she does take a swing at Gorilla… fucking Gorilla-Mikey. Uh, let’s see, that one…
Cassidy: You know what’s funny is… Turning into a gorilla, or an ape rather because there’s no specific gorilla, actually reduces how many hit points I have.
Lilith: Hmm! What does it make your–
Cassidy: Like it doesn’t actual–
Lilith: What’s your AC?
Cassidy: Oh, it’s actually the same. Well, it’s 12.
Lilith: Twelve? Ok.
Cassidy: Mikey’s AC is twelve and so is the ape’s, so…
Lilith: OK. So, she tries, she takes a swing and she misses. Ah, aw drats! Ah beans.
Amanda: I cast a spell at Bernice, as much as we love Bernice, I feel like it’s the only way we can get her off that wall so Mikey can… Is Mikey on top of the wall now?
Lilith: Yeah, Mikey’s on top of the wall, Mikey has the rope.
Amanda: Alright. Well I think, I mean, I guess… [More Hesitantly] Should we yell over at Mikey to let down the rope?
Cassidy: Oh I imagined he was holding one end of it and y’all were holding the other.
Amanda: Ahhhh, ok. Alright, um…. Well shit! I guess we’ve got a way up now! I go over to the rope and start climbing the wall.
Lilith: Ok, ok.
Amanda: Hammer in hand.
Lilith: Yeah, uh, make me an Athletics check.
Amanda: … mmm that’s not bad. Yeah athletics, definitely not… I got a 14 on my check.
Lilith: Fourteen? Ok, Ok, great, fantastic. You are able to make it up the wall. You are, you’re at the top and Bernice kinda doesn’t know which one of you to go at but she kind of kicks at Petua… Oooh, I know that hits. Yeah, she just connects boot to face on Petua, and I need you to make me a Dexterity saving throw.
Amanda: Mkay… [Rolls Dice, Cries Out] It’s a nat. 20!
Lilith: OK! You’re able to hold onto that rope and you’re able to make it up to the top. By the way, you did take two damage, just, yeah…
Amanda: Even though it was a- oh, guess it did it.
Lilith: You did save on the Dex throw to not fall off the wall, so…
Amanda: Right, right right, do I get to attack back or no?
Lilith: You can if you want.
Amanda: Well, Jesus, yeah, I’m definitely about to do that shit. I wipe my probably bruised and bleeding nose, if she kicked me in the face, and I look at my hammer and I say “Uh, I guess this is worth a shot” and I swing it at her knees.
Lilith: [Chortles]
Syd: Oh god…. Jesus
Lilith: Roll to hit.
Amanda: I mean not, not like hard. Just enough in the knees. [Rolls Dice] With a hammer.
Syd: Just enough to get a message across.
Amanda: Wait, hold on sorry, that was a… What do I add to an attack roll? Just nothing, just to see if it hit right? Sorry. It’s been a while.
Lilith: Uhmmm, yeah for you, for a physical attack- Well, the hammer is, I think it has a +1 or something to it.
Amanda: Yeah, it’s a simple-… yeah for Warlock spellcasting but not for this. I got a 17 anyways, so.
Lilith: OK, ok. So you manage to hit Bernice right in the fucking knees. And she is, she takes the hit, how much damage does that do?
Amanda: It does 1 d6+2? Um, but, oh god I feel so bad. That’s 7 damage.
Lilith: Ah don’t worry about it, Bernice is ok. She’s on one knee, yeah, Mikey has the rope. Petua is safely at the top of the tower. Bernice, she kinda seems like she… Petua and Mikey might be lost causes. She’s looking at the remainder of the party. Gonna see if she can try to prevent one of y’all from getting up.
Syd: All right.
Lilith: Yeah, go for it Elektra.
Syd: I’ll go. I wanna try to put her to sleep.
Lilith: Oh fuck.
Amanda: [Laugh] All Right.
Syd: So I’m gonna y’know, direct the speaker in her direction and do some soft soft synths–
Lilith: Some chillwave.
Syd: … to put this large woman to sleep.
Lilith: OK. I assume there’s like a save I have to do now right?
Syd: Uhm, let me see… [murmurs] … No.
Lilith: Wait, you can’t just put people to sleep without
Syd: Alright, hold on. OK: Spell sends creatures into a magical slumber, roll 5 d8. The total is how many Hit Points of creatures this spell could effect. Creatures within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points. Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by the spell falls unconscious until the spell ends. Sleeper takes damage when someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.
Lilith: OK. OK.
Syd: So really it has to do if I match her hit points.
Lilith: Yes, roll those die for me.
[Lullaby-like Ambient Synths are punched in]
Lilith: I’m feeling sleepy already. Um… Yeah, roll those die.
Amanda: [croons the ‘Lullaby & Good Night’ melody]
Syd: That’s that, and now… [Rolls Dice] That’s 8… 13… 15… 23… 28.
Lilith: Twenty-Eight? She uh, kinda blinks a little bit. But then she just kind of shakes her head, and then she Huh. Got some sick tunes kid. Come on, get it. She’s on her feet.
Syd: Um, as my bonus?
Lilith: Mm-hmm?
Syd: I will… cast Bardic Inspiration on… Kevin hasn’t gone up yet, right?
Robyn: Nah.
Syd: I will use that on you then.
[Synth Horn Fanfare]
Syd: It gives you a Bardic Inspiration die, a d6, which within the next 10 minutes the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one Ability Check, Attack Roll or Saving Throw.
Lilith: Ok!
Syd: Creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but MUST decide before the DM decides whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once it’s rolled it’s lost.
Lilith: Ok. Cool, cool. Alright.
Syd: And then I’m gonna try to scale the wall with… Can I do that at the same time with movement? OK.
Lilith: Yeah, sure! Go ahead, go ahead, roll me an athletic check.
Syd: [rolls dice and sputters] That’s, that’s a, that is a 1.
Lilith: It’s a one? OK.
Syd: That is a one.
Lilith: Oh, just flashbacks of gym class.
Syd: Guh.
Lilith: Elektra just gets on the rope and… I don’t know. Maybe it’s just sweaty palms ‘cause Bernice is just staring Elektra down just as soon as she gets on the rope? And you’re just not able to get up. The rope. At all! And uh, Kevin!
Robyn: Yes.
Lilith: What are you gonna try?
Robyn: Well, as a rogue… I don’t, I feel like I don’t have too many options in this situation. I’m gonna try to point and go “Hey look at that!” and then try to sneak up the rope really quick.
Lilith: [Laughs] Are you gonna like throw something, or… ?
Amanda: Uhhh…
Lilith: You’re gonna try to distract uh, Bernice….
Robyn: Yeah I’m just gonna be like ‘hey, hey look over there!’
Amanda: Hey! Uhm… sorry. I didn’t wanna interrupt.
Robyn: No please do.
Amanda: But uh Kevin, and everyone… Our goal is to get over the wall right?
Robyn: Yeah.
Amanda: And we have to be over the wall. What if… I’m just throwing this out here, cause it’s obviously just gonna be more and more difficult when there are more of us on the wall and Bernice keeps trying to kick us down. What if Mikey grabbed her and went down the wall, and like, crawled down it; because he’s still a gorilla right? And then I hold the rope?
Robyn: That’s fun. I like that.
Amanda: I mean if it’s difficult if we don’t have any spells to cast or something but also if Kevin if you wanted to try something I’m also down for that. I don’t wanna…
Robyn: I don’t have any spells, so…
Amanda: Alright… yeah… I feel like that’s a thing that can happen right? I think that Mikey can successfully rappel down the wall holding somebody or at least–
Cassidy: Mikey is shaking, or, he’s uh nodding vigorously.
Amanda: Alright, Mikey? D’you wanna do that?
Cassidy: Nodding more vigorously.
Amanda: Alright! I kinda just step aside and hold the rope! And I look over at Bernice and I say Hey, shouldn’t have kicked me in the face!
Cassidy: I make a grapple attempt then.
Lilith: Ok. Roll me that strength check, I’m contesting it.
Cassidy: I got a 19. Or sorry, a 20.
Lilith: You got a 20, ok. You–
Cassidy: Not like a natural 20 just 17+3.
Lilith: You are able to successfully grapple Bernice. She’s just kind of struggling against you though.
Cassidy: OK as part of, so… When I shapeshifted I adopt a stat line of the animal in question, including its actions. So being an ape means I automatically get multi-attack? Because I get two fists.
Amanda: [Chortles] Right… !
Cassidy: So the grapple counts as one of those attacks, I’m just going to use the other attack to just straight up, swing on her. Like if you could imagine this ape, this fucked-up ape creature having her in a headlock, just like, yeah. That’s what I’m doing.
Lilith: Ok
Cassidy: Mikey’s a little heated from that kicking Petua in the face…. Uh, do I… ? I just want to look… Do you know the grappling rules that well? I’ve got them in front of me here. I just want to know if there’s if having… If attacking a grappled creature, there’s any penalty to their AC or anything?
Lilith: Um, I’ll give you advantage.
Cassidy: It’s just like, I’m probably going to do this a lot, so I just want to know how this actually works? I have played many grapple-fighters in my life, because I am that person.
Lilith: Shocking! Shocking! I would’ve never guessed.
Cassidy: Actually I’ve only played two. But both of them were really successful… OK I got a 15.
Lilith: Fifteen? Ok, you connect with that swing. Um?
Cassidy: I got an 8.
Lilith: Yeah. Her nose is very bloody. Sorry, what was… go ahead Amanda?
Amanda: Oh yeah no, I was just wondering if Mikey was planning on jumping off down the wall now that he’s got Bernice held back. Because I’m just wondering if having somebody physically restraining Bernice is like, possible? Since that seems to be the obstacle? That was what I was wondering about. But if that’s not a thing–
Cassidy: Oh I just figured that would be probably a two-turn kind of operation.
Amanda: Ohhhh.
Lilith: Yeah, sure. She’s restrained but now she’s going to attack with Disadvantage. She rolled a… 13!
Cassidy: So just against my AC?
Lilith: Yeah.
Cassidy: Normally that’d be a hit.
Lilith: That’d be… OK.
Cassidy: Yeah I don’t know what, again I don’t know what the grappling rules are but we’ll just call it a hit for now I guess.
Lilith: Well, yeah. I gave her Disadvantage based on the grappling.
Cassidy: Ok yeah, that’s enough for me.
Lilith: And ok, so she manages to punch Mikey in the face for 3 damage.
Cassidy: OK
Lilith: And, uh, yeah! Again once… now the field’s open. Anyone who wants to just try something can go for it.
Robyn: I’m just gonna try to climb the darn rope.
Lilith: OK. Yeah, make me an Athletics check.
Robyn: Whuh that is a… That is a 6.
Cassidy: I like that this is a party of people that just didn’t go to or failed gym class.
[Assorted Laughter]
Amanda: It’s very true.
Cassidy: The best part is I said that referring to the characters, but that’s probably true of the players as well.
Robyn: They don’t make, they didn’t make us try to climb ropes. I was good at– Yeah, that never happened.
Amanda: Wow… what!?
Cassidy: Well I just meant that, but did you fail gym class?
Robyn: No!
Cassidy: Oh well, you’re a square then.
Amanda: I did…
Robyn: I wouldn’t have been able to do the rope thing, but they never had us do it! So I passed.
Amanda: [sotto voce] There we go.
Lilith: We’re all very successful and that’s why we’re making a Role-Playing podcast for the internet. That’s very clear.
Amanda: Yeah… Mhmm
Lilith: So… Robyn what was that Athletics check again?
Robyn: It was a six.
Lilith: It was a six? Ok. So once again, yeah, Kevin just kind of flails… Just trying to get up that rope, is not able to do it.
Syd: Lemme give it a try.
Lilith: Ok.
Syd: Athletics check… [rolls dice] Goddamnit! That’s a 5.
Lilith: HA!
Amanda: Woooow….
Lilith: [Chuckling] Just everybody… I- I dunno guys, it might be time to start thinking about a change in strategy.
Amanda: Yeah, climbing up that rope, huh? Uh…
Lilith: Petua, is there something you wanna try?
Amanda: Yeah, um, alright. The only thing that I could think of to do besides to get everybody up and over the wall is to topple the wall, and I feel like that won’t work, right?
Lilith: I’m not gonna tell you if that will work.
Cassidy: I mean I feel like it’ll work if we’re given enough time.
Amanda: Yeah. But how solid is this wall?
Lilith: It’s uh, it does not… Plywood and 2x4s and it’s a lot heavier on the plywood side than the 2x4s.
Amanda: Alright. I think I would like to try and, I guess, grab the rope? And, well, hmm. What’s the best side to do this on? ‘Cause Mikey’s still fighting Bernice.
Lilith: Correct.
Amanda: Alright I think I’m gonna let Mikey finish fighting Bernice and see how that pans out before I do anything.
Lilith: OK, Mikey, what’re you gonna do?
Cassidy: I just wanna like… I guess this would fall under the ‘shove’ action? But I just wanna, like, throw the top of the wall.
Amanda: [Giggles] Good shit. Good shit.
Lilith: Okay.
Cassidy: Like on the far side, not where Electra and Kevin are?
Lilith: Yeah, yeah.
Cassidy: ‘cause I just think that’s another opposed strength test… Well it says I can either… Like drag her off the wall, because I’ve got her grappled? Orrr just shove.
Amanda: I think it would be good if you were on the other side of the wall with her, actually. So that might be a thing worth doing.
Cassidy: OK then I don’t have to roll for that I just can move her–
Lilith: Okay.
Cassidy: … and drag her, but I can only move at half my speed.
Amanda: ‘Drag ha’.
Cassidy: But I kind of just, ‘backpack’ her and fall from the wall.
Lilith: [Laughs]
Amanda: Yes. I love this.
Lilith: Holy shit. OK… Now hold on. You just said you fall off of the 20 foot wall?
Amanda: Mikey did get UP the wall without a 20 foot rope!
Cassidy: Yeah… ?
Amanda: So like, I feel like going down is just as easy.
Cassidy: I’m gonna make sure she’s on the bottom when we land, but…
Amanda: [gleefully] Yeaaaaaah.
Lilith: [Laughs] So you just, you just like–
Cassidy: Mikey is not especially worried about hurting himself in this scenario.
Lilith: I didn’t think so… ! Um, so Mikey took 3 points of damage from that fall. And Bernice, she seemed to take that fall a lot harder, obviously. But she is just flat-out, on the ground, groaning. I’m gonna say that you lost grapple control of her when you landed.
Cassidy: Ok.
Lilith: Uh, Electra and Kevin?
Amanda: Alright.
[Synth Music Cues Up, Specifically an 8-Bit rendition of a Vangelis standard]
Syd: Then yeah I guess, gotta just go.
Amanda: I’m holding the rope.
Lilith: Just do it again. You’ve got fucking, Chariots of Fire music playing while you’re rolling this dice roll. Let’s do it.
Syd: I love… was that Vangelis, I think?
Lilith: That was.
Syd: [Rolls Dice, then in disbelief] It’s… and 11.
Lilith: It’s an eleven! Oh my god! She stuggled, but Elektra makes it to the top of the wall! It is…
Amanda: [Hums the “Chariots of Fire” theme]
Lilith: Yeah, it’s a little embarrassing how much you struggle? Especially with the other ones, but hey! You’re the bard, whatever! Kevin!
Syd: I’m not used to climbing stuff with my gear on, y’know?
Robyn: Um, how long does Bardic Inspiration last again?
Syd: Um…
Lilith: It’s kinda just ‘till you use it, right?
Robyn: Oh I thought there was a time limit on there. Alright, cool.
Lilith: You lose it eventually, but like…
Robyn: Yeah…. OK cool.
Syd: Like, when you sleep or something, I think…
Robyn: Cool so I’m also gonna try to just climb that rope again.
Lilith: OK.
Robyn: Eh…. Alright, got a 14.
Lilith: Fourteen, OK!
Syd: Nice!
Lilith: Kevin is able to make it up the wall and all three of you are, you’re on top of the wall… I gotta tell you, with Bernice incapacitated on the other side of the wall I think the uh, the descent is going to be a lot less exciting. I’m just going to… You all three make it down from the wall. Congratulations. Uh, good job. Streamers, come out of the base of the wall.
Cassidy: Where was Uncle Stickey this whole time?
Amanda: Yeah.
Lilith: Uncle Stickey was watching.
Cassidy: So he’s just chill with us beating up his niece
Amanda: Beating up his niece, yeah.
Lilith: Oh yeah. Like he said, Bernice can take it. Bernice is gonna be fine, don’t worry. So, so–
[Soft synths creep in]
Cassidy: I mean I think we proved Bernice can’t take Mikey.
Amanda: This is true.
Lilith: I mean… yeah, but she’s alive! Bernice kinda gets up and dusts herself off. There’s lots of streamers and confetti. Good job! You’ve passed the first challenge! This is but one of three, but you’re doing great so far. Congratulations, Mikey! Uh, do we still call you Mikey?
Cassidy: Mikey nods.

Lilith: Hey everyone, Lilith here with a quick reminder. Just a couple things, couple programming notes. 1: We’re on iTunes now so you can subscribe to us, review us, that really helps us out quite a bit. Also we have a Patreon now! If you go to patreon.com/ghostpuncher and you can kick in a little bit if you’ve been enjoying the show, if you want to help support it that’d be very, very great. As of right now I’m running the whole show out of my own pocket, hosting fees, recording equipment, everything like that. Which I’ve always been happy to do because I love this show. But if you want to help out, make things a little bit easier for me, I’m not exactly rolling in cast. Once again that’s patreon.com/ghostpuncher. Thanks!"
"TRANSCRIPT - EPISODE 5
Uncle Stickey's House of Humours - vol II","(Transcription by Micha Cavaseno, contact for transcription work here)
[Music Fades In: Skagos – Blossoms Will Sprout From the Carcass]
Lilith: Previously on Ghostpuncher Corps!
Lilith: You’re outside Uncle Stickey’s
Welcome to my House of Humors!
Amanda: Oh god.
Robyn: So is this like a weird ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ thing or… ?
Amanda: What is the nature of this… club challenge?
Lilith: Ah yes, my humble treasure club! I’m so glad you asked!… If you pass, you can keep your items and you now have lifetime membership to Uncle Stickey’s Treasure Club! And if you fail, you will be forced to surrender all of your purchases by Bernice
I’ve taken a slot bracelet from a crying toddler, I don’t give a shit, try me!
Syd: Elektra giggles.
Lilith: I know your type!
Amanda: I think you are her type!
Cassidy: Something happens which is deeply disturbing. Some Altered States evolutionary regression kinda stuff. A fucked up gorilla-esque human ancestor.
Lilith: So light your torches, ready your blades, and keep an eye out for peril. As we join the adventures of the Ghostpuncher Corps.
[Musical interlude]
Lilith: First off, honestly we’ve got a couple housekeeping things…
Syd: Yeah.
Amanda: Mmmhm.
Lilith: One, um, hey we’re on iTunes! That’s cool!
Syd: Yeah!
Amanda: That is cool!
Lilith: Yeah! 2, Robyn has left the podcast. At least for now…
Syd: [mimics a sad slide-trombone]
Lilith: Yeah, it’s not awesome, obviously I’m not thrilled about it. But, like…
Cassidy: Shit happens.
Lilith: Shit happens, and also like Robyn’s really busy down in Austin it sounds like. I’m friends with them on Facebook and they’ve got shows going on all the time which, by the way, if you’re in Austin, Texas; keep an eye out for Robyn Reynolds’ shows and stuff. They do a lot of improv comedy around town, and they’re really funny! You can check out the first three episodes of this podcast for proof!
[A Karaoke version of Korn’s “Freak On A Leash” suddenly blares into the mix]
Lilith: One thing we need to discuss is how we’re going to resolve this from a story perspective. Kevin…. Kevin left, Kevin got food poisoning, Kevin got pinched for credit card fraud, I don’t know.
Cassidy: I mean, I feel like Kevin, it seems… is probably the most likely person to just get really freaked out by this whole assignment and just be like “Nope! I’m out.”
Amanda: I was just going to say… Yeah.
Syd: What was Kevin’s class? Was he a rogue?
Lilith: He was a rogue, he was a rogue. And I just, really quickly, me and Robyn had talked about it… Kevin was going to level into Arcane Trickster and I had a really fun moment planned out for Kevin where Kevin’s tattoo was going to start talking to him.
Syd: Oh my god… Oh my god…!
Amanda: That’s…
Lilith: And do a sick vape trick that would show him secrets of the invisible Mage Hand that arcane tricksters get at level three.
Syd: Holy shit.
Lilith: That was gonna happen this session and honestly, it was such a good moment I just wanted to like, just toss it out there because I’m never going to be able to do that….
Amanda: Hey, excuse me, you don’t know about Petua’s tramp stamp so just keep on hoping.
[Music Cuts]
Lilith: So yeah, Kevin has left. Whatever it is the fiction ends up being, the three of you are now, you’re at the base of the Great Wall of Friendship.
Syd: On the other side.
Lilith: Yes you surmounted a beaten and bloody Bernice. And Uncle Stickey, who just looks thrilled to see that you have succeeded.
Amanda: [hoarsely] And kicking his niece’s ass which still, that still fucks with me. Also, podcast listeners, I do apologize if I sound all fucked up. Petua smoked a ton of weed before getting on this podcast. She just smoked so much weed, you guys, it was such bad, intense, sticky hot weed and now I have a throat thing, so….
Lilith: [laughs] Petua has a throat thing today.
Amanda: I, actually, Kevin is in my throat. He lives in my throat now.
Lilith: Oh, wow, that’s–
Amanda: That’s some Shining shit, right?
Lilith: Yeah that’s kinda, that’s crazy. Um, I’m into it. Uhm… And actually, there’s–
Syd: Listen… There’s enough vore podcasts out there.
Amanda: Noooo!! You didn’t have to take it there… !
Cassidy: If this becomes a vore podcast I quit…
Amanda: The Shining is not about a ‘vore’, so this doesn’t have to be a vore.
Cassidy: There’s a lot of things I’m willing to roleplay, that’s one one of them.
Amanda: Yeah, nah.
Lilith: Ooookay! I just, let me just tear a few sheets out of the notebook real quick.
Cassidy: I’m sorry, me and you have already had this conversation.
Amanda: Which notebook, the one for your podcast or the one for your marriage?
Lilith: [laughs]
Cassidy: Both.
Lilith: Yeah yeah yeah, first one and then the other. But anyway…
Amanda: Ok, Ok. Reeling it back in.
Lilith: [chuckling] OK so, Uncle Stickey’s in front of you and he’s… Well, congratulations, it’s time for you to head on to your next challenge which is right through that door over there! And there’s a door at the other end of the room.
Prepare yourselves for the Pipe Organ of Doom!
Amanda: I really don’t wanna see your pipe organ. I’m fine I think.
Lilith: [brief stammer] Are you familiar with the, you ever been to church ma’am?
Amanda: I, I was making a joke I don’t know how terrible I sound. Yeah, yeah.
Syd: Elektra laughs.
Cassidy: What’s a pipe organ?
Amanda: It’s a very large piano. Kind of.
Cassidy: What’s a piano?
Amanda: The thing with all the keys? It’s black and white… ?
Syd: I like motion at my arms and
Amanda: Oh yeah.
Cassidy: Ohhhh yeah.
Syd: But bigger! And it uses wind.
Cassidy: Where are the keys though?
Syd: …. Let’s go see!
Lilith: Yeah, I assure you there’s one in the next room! As I just said. Uh, just really quick, there’s, in that room, there’s a key to get to the next room where you will face your final challenge. Uhm, and, yeah. Gotta find the key! Anyway! And he just bounces.
Syd: When you say ‘key’… ?
Cassidy: When you say ‘bounces’…. ?
[Assorted Laughter]
Amanda: He does seem like the kind of gentleman who would bounce, literally.
Lilith: Yeah, no, he kinda skips away in a very jovial fashion.
Cassidy: Okay.
Syd: So Elektra is very intrigued by y’know, any kind of keyboard.
Cassidy: I mean there were a lot of music puns in there. T-B-H.
Lilith: So you go in the next room, you see it’s kind of a quiet looking ‘study’ space. You see, there is to the right a pipe organ on the wall. You kinda see there’s a few things carved into it, you see just some kind of vague shapes. Not very bright in this room, it’s lit by candle; a few candles stacked on top of tables and shit like that. There’s a few bookcases, dusty old tomes and yeah, there’s a door on the other end of the room.
Syd: So we’re looking for a key. Um… I want to investigate the pipe organ, but what do I want to investigate about the pipe organ?
Lilith: I don’t know, what DO you want to investigate?
Syd: I kinda want to just look it over a little bit more closely while the other two do whatever they do.
Lilith: OK! Roll me I guess an investigation check.
Syd: [Rolls Dice] That… Is a 15.
Lilith: Fifteen? Ok. So you see, those carvings that I was referring to? It’s like the, a lot of the wood is like carved into subtle shapes of demons and devils and acts of unholy sorcery. And you see–
Syd: Bitchin’! Elektra says.
Lilith: Yeah! You see words carved into the wood above the keys!
Syd: How many keys are there?
Lilith: Uh, 49. I don’t know what’s the standard number of keys?
Amanda: The ordinary amount of keys?
Syd: OK. That’s a pretty… Fourty-Nine’s a pretty, pretty standard.
Lilith: Yeah, so the words you see carved above the keyboard.
Syd: [reading the encarved words] ”FOSSAS EFFODIUNT/ MALEFICIS INCENDERENT /HEROS, A TERGO”
Amanda: Hey now, not a… and some names scratched out?
Lilith: Yeah.
Syd: Hey, Petua. You seem to be knowledgeable on language stuff, what’s… ?
Amanda: It says “Dig trenches, burn sorcerers and strike from behind” and then there’s something I can’t quite make out that’s been scratched out.
Syd: Is there a ‘D’ in that? Can you possibly make out a ‘D’ or is it completely scratched out.
Amanda: A ‘D’? ‘D’ ‘F’ ‘M’… Oh, what do you mean? A ‘D’ ‘F’ ‘M’ ‘I’ ‘H’.
Syd: What’s Latin for ‘Dragula’?
Cassidy: … That was a dumb joke. It took me a minute.
Lilith: [Laughs] You still haven’t solved the puzzle so… No.
Cassidy: The answer is not ‘Dragula’?
Amanda: I’m so confused by what…
Lilith: [Laughs]
Syd: OK… Um.
Cassidy: Mikey is just gonna wander around the room, looking at random books, pulling them off the shelves. Just looking for a physical key.
Syd: Dig ditches, born sorcerers… what was the last bit?
Lilith & Amanda: [in unison] Strike from behind.
Syd: Strike from behind….
Cassidy: Strike from behind what?
Amanda: Oh, I see, the thing that we’re striking from behind has been scratched out. Not some other thing.
Syd: Is it like a word or a whole line that got scratched out?
Lilith: It looks like it was just about seven or eight characters worth of space. But somebody just really scratched it out.
Amanda: Ok. Hmm… Well, is there anything else in this room…? Besides the books and the organ?
Lilith: Books, candles, that’s about it!
Amanda: Alright. Well, here’s a thought. Why don’t we ignore this riddle for now and Elektra, why don’t you just try playing this organ?
Cassidy: Can I just roll a search to like, root through the room or is there any point to even doing that?
Lilith: I mean… You don’t find… You find books that Mikey doesn’t know how to read.
Cassidy: OK… Mikey’s looking for physical keys.
Lilith: Aaaaand… you find… Physical keys?
Cassidy: Yes. Like he was told there was a key in this room and he’s gonna find it.
Lilith: Well he’s not. He can’t find it just looking around the room right now.
Cassidy: Do you think the key might be magic?
Syd: Is the organ running right now? Can I tell if it’s a mechanical organ or an electrical organ?
Lilith: It is a mechanical organ, it does seem to be running.
Syd: I would like to just press a key on it.
Lilith: OK.
Syd: Let’s say like a ‘D’ somewhere in the middle of the keyboard. [Note is struck] So I kinda like, look around, to see if I notice anything happen when I press a key on the organ.
Lilith: I mean, it just makes the note.
Syd: And that’s it, ok. Are there any additional, like, stops on the organ?
Lilith: No.
Syd: Is it just the keyboard and the whole… ‘interface’? Just, panel, wood…
Lilith: Yeah yeah. Yeah, your standard organ with a bunch of demonic shit carved into it.
Syd: Yeah.
Cassidy: Wait how many… We came through a door to get into this room, how many doors are there?
Lilith: There’s one other door.
Cassidy: One other door. What does the door look like?
Lilith: It looks like a plain wooden door?
Cassidy: Is there a handle?
Lilith: Yeah, there’s a handle on it.
Cassidy: OK I’m gonna try opening the door!
Lilith: OK it’s locked.
Cassidy: Is there a keyhole?
Lilith: There’s a keyhole.
Cassidy: OK.
Amanda: If only we had somebody who could pick locks here.
Lilith: Yeaaah.
Amanda: Darn. Wouldn’t that be great? Anyways I’m just pondering, alright. Just getting real philosophical this evening. Mikey.
Cassidy: Yep!
Amanda: Do you remember when we were in that lady’s house and you looked for, I guess then it was the truck nuts.
Cassidy: Oh yeah!
Amanda: Do you want to try doing that again?
Cassidy: Yeah I can do that again.
Amanda: Alright.
Cassidy: So, Mikey kinda stops and closes his eyes and rocks back on his heels a couple times. Opens them again, pitch black eyes and I cast Detect Magic.
Lilith: OK! Uhhh… you do see the organ does seem to be enchanted.
Cassidy: OK. So do I discern anything else about the nature of this enchantment?
Lilith: It’s Enchantment magic, that’s…
Cassidy: OK. So no is the answer.
Lilith: Well, Enchantment is a school of magic. Like, I don’t…
Cassidy: No, that’s fair. I guess you’re right. Mikey will relay the information that there’s something up with the organ. That it’s unusual or magic.
Syd: Interesting… Well, the key…
Amanda: Wait, can I… ?
Cassidy: D’ya think maybe the key is inside the organ? Can we take it apart? I can break it.
Syd: Well, he might’ve been referring to a musical key, which is a collection of notes that… it makes a specific…
Cassidy: Mikey is hanging on your every word and understanding none of it.
Syd: [Laughs]
Amanda: I mean could these be references to songs?
Syd: I’m saying… Yes, that’s what I’m thinking. Maybe we have to play the organ in a special way and that’s the key to open the door, seeing as it’s enchanted.
Cassidy: Maybe you have to play it with your feet! That would be really hard.
Syd: Not if we have foot pedals. Are there any foot pedals on this organ?
Lilith: I mean, there are because there usually are on an organ.
Syd: It’s an organ! Yeah… I wanna sit at the organ and just… start playing the hit song [Regresses into giggles] song by Rob Zom…
Amanda: Song’s called ‘Dracula’?
Cassidy: Rob Zombie, “Dragula”.
Lilith: OK, you, I want you to roll me, what is it a Performance check? Roll me a performance check. ‘Cause you’re playing “Dragula” by ear, the opening synth riff of “Dragula” by ear.
Syd: Yes [Rolls Dice] That is a… 13.
Lilith: [Organs Cue] Ok! You hear those spooky chords come out, and as soon as you hit that third note and release… A little drawer opens up beneath the keys–
Syd: Oh shit!
Lilith: And inside is a tiny metal key.
Amanda: Oh wow! Good call!
Syd: Noice.
Amanda: What song was that, I’ve never heard it before.
Syd: It’s “Dragula” by Rob Zombie.
Amanda: Fascinating.
Syd: Hey Petua, would it be… ‘Dragula’ is not Latin, what’s Latin for ‘chariot’?
Amanda: Uh, pause! Pause the game! [Laughs]
Cassidy: What’s a chariot?
Syd: It’s like a… a bucket that a person can stand in, and it’s got wheels on the side of it.
Cassidy: Oh.
Amanda: The expression is ‘sinum currus’.
Cassidy: What’s Latin?
Syd: Hmmm. A dead language.
Amanda: Oh Latin’s a very old language.
Cassidy: Oh ok.
Amanda: It’s good though!
Syd: So I take the key and I walk towards the door with it, and put the key in the key slot. Unless something else happens.
Lilith: No keep going.
Amanda: I don’t think that’s how D&D works also, like I think you just gotta commit to the bit.
Syd: I turn the key in the, does it go into the–
Lilith: Yeah the key goes into the door!
Syd: Does it unlock it?
Lilith: Yeah! The door unlocks and the door swings open.
Syd: What is in the next room.
Lilith: So you see in the next room, it’s kind of a performance area? There’s kind of lines of benches on each side of the area and kind of a very short wooden stage. And Bernice is sitting on the stage. She’s got an Icee in her hand, just kinda slurping away at it. And she sees the three of you!
Syd: Oh. H-Hi… Elektra waves a little bit.
Lilith: Hey.
Cassidy: Hey Bernice.
Lilith: Hey Mikey.
Amanda: Oh, hello again.
Lilith: Wow y’all got through that.
Cassidy: Sorry I punched you in the face…. Aw, okay.
Lilith: Nah it’s… That’s chill. That’s chill. All part of the game, y’know?
Cassidy: I didn’t want to but you hit Petua.
Lilith: Hey. Like I said, all part of the game, all’s fair. Petua, I hope there’s no hard feelings.
Amanda: Um, well, your fist was pretty hard, and my face is full of feelings so yes.
Lilith: She rattles the slurpee in her hand in that way to kinda loosen it up a little bit and kinda points it towards you. You want a sip?
Amanda: I really don’t. I’ve kinda got a throat thing happening, I don’t think you want my….
Lilith: Oh yeah right. I hear that, I hear that.
Amanda: Yeah it happened in like, five minutes, it wasn’t great! No, no I’m good. Unless that has any kind of healing or restorative properties in which case I will definitely take a hit of that.
Lilith: I mean, I could put some Day-Quil in it if you want me to!
Amanda: [Wearily] Is that what you folks do out here?
Lilith: She pulls out a bottle… [Bursts into laughter]
Amanda: Oh shit.
Lilith: …shakes it again, and hands it over to you.
Amanda: I make eye-contact with her and take a long sip.
Lilith: That restores you for 2 points of damage.
Syd: [Laughs]
Amanda: Oh, shit! Alright!
Cassidy: Ok, so I gotta-, is this magic Day-Quil or…
[Assorted Chuckles]
Cassidy: Are we just accepting that Day-Quil gives you hit points.
Lilith: Day-Quil gives you back hit points.
Cassidy: OK.
Lilith: Folks, today we’re sponsored by Day-Quil apparently. Just put it in your Icee, it’ll make it better…
Cassidy: No I just hope that, I just want to know if that’s a true fact in this universe. Because, if there ever is a chance now that I’m low on health, that I need to not be low on health, I want to break into a fucking pharmacy to get super fucked up. And then get a bunch of health back!
Syd: Robo-Trippin’.
Lilith: The only… The reason the Day-Quil worked for Petua is because she has the throat-thing.
Cassidy: OK.
Amanda: [Chuckles}
Lilith: It’s all conditional, you gotta justify it to me in narrative.
Amanda: Alright.
Syd: That makes sense.
Cassidy: So being robo-trippin’ doesn’t make you invincible.
Lilith: No it does not.
Cassidy: OK.
Lilith: God.
Amanda: God…
Syd: Elektra timidly asks Bernice: So… what’s next?
Lilith: Oh. Y’all got done with all that stuff a little bit faster than we expected.
Syd: Have a knack.
Lilith: Uncle Stickey’s uh, getting ready. That was pretty cool what you did! Yeah.
Syd: Elektra blushes.
Lilith: Most of the six-year olds, even if they can stand getting punched in the face by me, they can’t get past the, y’know, the Rob Zombie trap as I like to call it.
Syd: It is a good one.
Amanda: Well, it is a good one. I’m not familiar with his work but that’s why we have Petua around… I mean, Petua, fuck. What was in that? It wasn’t Day-Quil. Elektra around.
[Syd & Amanda Chuckle]
Lilith: Yeah, yeah, uh, I think he’s gonna be out in a little bit, sorry. He’s… It’s like a costume change thing.
Amanda: Oh god, isn’t this a lot….? Right.
Lilith: Well he doesn’t get to this part a lot… Like I said, most of the kids that try this, I mean, doesn’t go as well.
Amanda: Children do this?
Lilith: Yeah, yeah! No, I mean… It’s kind of a thing FOR KIDS like… It’s like a tourist trap. You thought a secret treasure club was for adults?
Amanda: I mean…
Syd: Well, never change the song ‘cause… you find a kid who can do it, you got yourself a cool kid.
Cassidy: I didn’t know what to think frankly.
Lilith: Well, I mean, Mikey, you’re kind of, you’re like in a super position of like… 5 and thirty-somethin’? Right? So that’s–
Cassidy: What’s a super position?
Lilith: It’s like a really good position.
Cassidy: Cool.
Lilith: Yeah… Uh, and then, she hears, there’s a knock behind the stage. Well, looks like he’s ready. She jumps off the stage, not much of a jump, more like a hop. She just kind of walks out of the area that you’re in, and then Uncle Stickey comes out, onto the stage and then he’s actually… At first glance it actually seems like he’s wearing the same clothes he was wearing? But they all seem to be fitting him-
Cassidy: What clothes was he wearing before?
Lilith: It was just like… It’s a tan vest, striped button-down shirt and khaki pants. But it all just seems to be sitting on him a lot weirder now.
Syd: Huh.
Lilith: And he looks at all of you and he says Oh wonderful! You’ve passed your second challenge! Now, your final challenge. Now, let me know, are you ready?
Amanda: … As ready as I’ll ever be I guess.
Cassidy: Ready for what?
Syd: Sure, I guess.
[Stickey’s voice distorts and an Electric Wizard’s “Barbarian” kicks in]
Lilith: Ready to face The Wizard! And he tears away his clothes, it’s breakaway clothing, and underneath he’s wearing a cloak and a hood, the hood is obviously down and tights. And he kind of gestures his hands up in the air and waggles his fingers at you and it’s time to roll for initiative.
Amanda: Can I just say that this is a lot.
Lilith: [Laughs]
[Song Fades Out]
Cassidy: Can I just ask one simple question, and if you don’t have an answer that’s fine.
Lilith: Yes, OK.
Cassidy: It’s like, meta-gaming to know this, you don’t have to tell me.
[Dice Rolls in Background]
Cassidy: … but the clothes that he tore off, were those actually the same clothes he was wearing before, and does that mean Uncle Stickey just tear-away clothes all the time?
Amanda: [Laughing] That was my other question.
Cassidy: Or does he have, like a seperate set of tear-away clothes that look like his regular clothes. And if so, which one of those is stranger? Because I can’t decide! [Ends in Laughter]
Amanda: Me neither.
Lilith: [Laughs] Duplicate clothes with breakaways. He was wearing the genuine article before.
Cassidy: OK.
Lilith: Yeah.
Amanda: So does that mean he wakes up every morning and decides how weird he wants to get? Like, at the beginning of the day? Like do I wanna be able to tear away all my clothes?
Lilith: I mean–
Cassidy: I mean, what it does mean is this guy took off his clothes, put on a hood and robe and tights, and put on a seperate set of clothes over top of that, to look like the clothes he just took off, but aren’t. K.
Lilith: Yep! Yep. That is what he did.
Amanda: All right…
Syd: [sighs] Good grief.
Lilith: That is what he does, every day. Anyway, yeah. Throw that initiative in there.
Syd: 18!
Amanda: Ah, that’s a 20.
Lilith: Cool.
Cassidy: I rolled a 5.
Lilith: OK, Petua! You go first! It’s time for you to defeat the wizard!
Amanda: I sure will do that. Um, hm…. See, ‘cause I’ve got this awesome hammer now, that I really want to use, but I know that’s not the best thing to use right now? Maybe as a final blow kind of thing. I will however cast Chill Touch on him.
Lilith: Okay.
Amanda: Ghostly skeletal hand to a creature in range. The target takes 1d Necrotic damage on hit.
Lilith: Ok.
Amanda: So, gonna roll… And that’s a 16. Ok, so that’s sixteen plus 3 which is, 19.
Lilith: OK, that hits.
Amanda: Alright. Get ready for 1d Necrotic damage I guess… And uh, Petua, ok, can I add a little bit of story flavor here?
Lilith: Yeah, nononono absolutely.
Amanda: ‘cause I… so I know that this hammer is not necessarily a spellcasting Focus? But can I swing it as I cast the spell anyways?
Lilith: Oh, I mean, it’s a spellcasting focus.
Amanda: Oh, shit, it is. OK.
Lilith: Yeah! Yeah, it’s a +1 Warlock spellcasting focus.
Amanda: Oh, it is! How did I miss that, I wrote it down right on my sheet. Fuck of all this. Alright, I swing my hammer, and point it at him and say: Let’s see what this baby can do. And enjoy [Rolls Dice]… Whoop, that was a d10. Don’t enjoy that… Enjoy [Rolls Dice Again] 6 points of damage.
Lilith: Fuck, all right!
Amanda: And also the hand is clinging to him and he can’t regain hit points until the start of my next turn.
Syd: [Dryly] No Day-Quil.
Lilith: Uuuugh! Uuuugh Gross! He’s like, shaking… Where did you, where did you aim it at? Like what part of him is it stuck to?
Amanda: Throat.
Lilith: Throat! He is like, grasping at it and just kind of like waaaah! This is super gross and weird!
Syd: [Laughs]
Amanda: And just to make sure, Uncle Stickey not an undead target is he?
Lilith: Yeah, Uncle Stickey’s like, a person.
Amanda: Ok, so he’s not undead.
Lilith: He is not undead.
Amanda: Just checking, alright. I’ve got my hands on him though! He’s literally caught these hands. Alright.
Syd: [Chortles]
Lilith: Elektra, it’s your turn!
Syd: I’m, gonna take it from the situation that he’s not a real wizard [Snickers]
Lilith: Well?
Syd: I guess we’ll find out. Gonna do Vicious Mockery and, um… Yeah it’s just a Wisdom saving throw.
Lilith: OK.
Syd: So I will say my mockery. [Warped Sounding] You look shitty and ridiculous.
Amanda: How did that get so loud? I mean, goodness.
Cassidy: Harsh.
Syd: He must succeed on a wisdom saving throw for… 12. Or take one d4 in Psychic damage.
Lilith: Okay. Well he just rolled a 17 so he says I LOOK FANTASTIC! And you know what, I think this hand is… pretty befitting of me as well so nyeh! And so he actually raises up his hands and he points at Elektra’s amp! And then it turns off!
Amanda: Oh.
Syd: No. Don’t do that.
Lilith: ‘cause he just cast the spell On/Off.
Syd: Don’t do that!
Lilith: Yeah! [Scoffs] Not a real wizard…
[Assorted Laughter]
Lilith: Um, let’s see. And that he was actually able to cast as a bonus action so he then turns to Petua and, I need Petua to make a Wisdom saving throw.
Amanda: Ooookay. Let’s see [Rolls Dice] That’s a 13 plus 1, so a 14.
Lilith: Damn, you just saved yourself from Crown of Madness. OK, Mikey, it’s your turn.
Amanda: Awwww….
Cassidy: Ok, so… How big is this room?
Lilith: Uh it is about 50 feet across, 50 feet long. It is a very small performance space.
Cassidy: Ok. Aaaaand….
Lilith: Like for puppet shows, or that kind.
Cassidy: So you said it’s like 15×15?
Lilith: No, 50×50.
Cassidy: 50 by 50 OK. How spread out is everybody right now. Basically who is within 15 feet of me?
Lilith: Um, I think y’all would’ve been in the same kind of clump. Uncle Stickey is up on the stage he’s about 30 feet away.
Cassidy: I’m gonna use my second Wild Shape for the day and Mikey is just going to sort of explode… not out of his shirt, because thankfully the pug face t-shirt is a Triple XL. But out of his pants certainly.
Syd: [laughter then groans]
Amanda: Oh that’s very bad.
Cassidy: So when Mikey shape-shifts, it’s not really like him turning into an animal, it’s more him like, turning into the closest human ancestor to that animal is? So the Grizzly I imagine to.. A giant fucked up, giganthropithicus-looking thing with this statline of–
Amanda: That’s a great word… Yeah.
Cassidy: What, giganthropithicus? It is a great word. So yeah I turn into that, and I just charge and attack him.
Lilith: That’s awesome. Ok, yeah, is that just like a Scratch attack or…?
Cassidy: Oh, hold on I’m pulling it’s text up. OK, so it does give me Multi-Attack because pretty much all animals it seems have that?
Lilith: Mmmhmmm.
Cassidy: One Bite and one Claw attack.
Lilith: Okay!
Cassidy: OK, so I got a 13 on my Claw attack?
Lilith: Ok, that hits.
Cassidy: Ok so… Oh wow, being a bear rules. OK so he takes 2 d6 worth of damage.
Lilith: [sotto voce] Fuckin’ A.
Syd: Goddang.
Cassidy: Which is, 8 plus my strength modifier, he takes 12 points of damage.
Lilith: OK!
Amanda: Damn.
Lilith: And you said you had Multi-Attack, right?
Cassidy: Yeah, and then I also have a Bite attack. I rolled a 16 for that… Also hit?
Lilith: Fuckin’ A! Alright. Yep.
Cassidy: And that does… Another 10 damage. I’m sorry, 9 damage. I rolled a 5. It’s one d8 and I got 4 Strength modifier.
Lilith: Alright, alright. OK. He’s looking real bad, like… He’s now being mauled by a bear. And kinda looks like a person who’s being mauled by a bear.
Cassidy: Can I specify that it’s not a bear, it’s a large vaguely human-like creature with Mikey’s face and a pug t-shirt.
Amanda: God…
Lilith: Yeah.
Cassidy: What I really want is I just want to get this podcast to the point that people are making fan-art of what Mikey’s Wild Shapes look like, because I think that’s gonna be the best thing.
Lilith: That’s gonna be like, so… Oh god. We’re gonna get the most upsetting images. Send those all to my wife! Don’t fucking send them to me, I don’t need those nightmares.
[Assorted Nervous Laughter]
Cassidy: If there’s gonna be fan art of Mikey I want it, I want to see it. I will print it out, I will put it on the refrigerator. I swear to God.
Lilith: Let’s see, okay. So Mikey did all that damage… Is horrifying prehistoric Mikey-beast going to do anything after biting and slashing at this–
Cassidy: That’s pretty much all I can do.
Lilith: This man who, he looks to be about I would say about… I think I said mid-60s? Last time… ?
Cassidy: Hey! He started a fight. Mikey brought the fight.
Amanda: Mikey did bring the fight.
Lilith: Mikey fucking brings the fight, God. Alright. Petua, it is your turn.
Amanda: Wow, good job Mikey. I’m really impressed by this bear. I’m going to cast… You know what? I say just have that Chill Touch hand just tighten its grip around his throat, I wanna cast it again.
Lilith: Okay. Do you roll… A save, no, was that a save? Sorry.
Amanda: No it’s just to see if it’ll hit again.
Lilith: Oh, ok. Go ahead.
Amanda: Alright. [Rolls Dice] Hooooo. That was a 2.
Lilith: Ohhhh, ok. The hand around his neck breaks it’s grasp but, y’know, he doesn’t seem all that happy about it because y’know, there’s still a bear, still a prehistoric bear-thing on top of him? Um, Elektra, it is your turn, and your amp is off.
Syd: Can I, Can I turn it back on?
Lilith: That’s gonna be your action for the turn, it’s gonna take a sec.
Syd: Oh nooooo.
Amanda: Do you have any pointy objects?
Syd: I’ve got a bat… I mean I have a knife, combat knife….
Amanda: I say you whack him in the head.
Syd: Yeah that was my thought….
Amanda: Yeah, just go bowling with this motherfucker, isn’t he prone?
Lilith: Yeah, he is!
Amanda: [Whispering] Whack him with the bat.
Syd: Um, yeah. Get my bat, say No-one fucks with my gear asshole! And come at him with my bat.
Lilith: Okay, Okay. Yeah, roll to hit!
Syd: [Rolls Dice] Nooo it fell.
Amanda: Oooh, it’s bad luck.
Syd: Let’s see… [Rolls Again] It’s an 18.
Lilith: Eighteen hits!
Syd: [Rolls Again] T-Two. 2 damage.
Lilith: Two damage. I mean, he takes it, but obviously he’s a lot more worried about the bear. And, uh–
Syd: Sure.
[Assorted Laughter]
Lilith: The horrifying prehistoric bear-thing. And he–
Cassidy: I’m sort of imagining it as like, the point where apes diverged from giant sloths? I know that’s not a real point in evolution…
Amanda: Oh my god.
Syd: Oh my god….
Cassidy: But, that’s what I’m imagining.
Lilith: He casts Max’s Earthen Grasp. And I need Mikey to make an Intelligence saving throw.
Cassidy: OK.
Lilith: Oh, I’m sorry. A Strength saving throw.
Cassidy: Oh well that’s way better. I’m a fucking Bear! Like literally.
Lilith: [Softly] That’s true, you are a bear…
Cassidy: Uh, I got a… 16.
Lilith: Sixteen? OK. He’s not… [chortles]
[Assorted Snorts & Giggles]
Lilith: Sorry y’all, there’s a very good picture of a… It looks like a fucked up diorama prehistoric ape thing.
Syd: The ‘Kentish Ape Man’.
Cassidy: Yes. Exactly that. That’s exactly what is beating the crap out of Uncle Stickey right now. Except with Mikey’s beard and t-shirt.
[Assorted noises of horror and disgust]
Syd: Uh, god, I’m gonna go to GIMP later.
Lilith: Ugh, oh, you just… Okay, alright. Well! This, this fucked up terrifying creature, it manages to escape Max’s, and thus in by proxy, Uncle Stickey’s Earthen Grasp. And it is Mikey’s turn.
Cassidy: OK, soooo… How fucked up is Uncle Stickey right now, because Mikey’s not really trying to kill him or anything.
Lilith: He… He does look like he is… Um! He looks bad, like his nose is bleeding. You can tell there’s a little bit of blood dribbling out of his mouth.
Cassidy: OK.
Lilith: He, yeah. He looks bad!
Cassidy: OK, so I’m gonna drop my Wild Shape. Suddenly Mikey kind of deflates from this horrible ape-creature down to regular Mikey but wearing shreds of pants instead of pants. Uhhh, and I’ll cast Entangle.
Lilith: Ok.
Amanda: Nice.
Cassidy: He has to take a save, I think it’s a Reflex save. But it might be strength I’m just checking… Uhhh, creature under spell must succeed on Strength saving throw or be restrained.
Lilith: Okay. What’s the DC on that?
Cassidy: Oh it’s my spell-save DC which I guess is my, spell-modifier I think… ? Or my Efficiency bonus and my Wisdom modifier?
Lilith: It’s uh… OK, your saving throw DC is 8 plus your… Whatever your modifier is for your spellcasting? Plus your efficiency bonus.
Cassidy: OK. Thennn, you said eight, plus that?
Lilith: Eight, plus yeah.
Cassidy: Ok so… That mean the Spell DC is 13.
Lilith: Thirteen? He rolled a 12.
Cassidy: Ok. So Uncle Stickey is restrained.
Lilith: Uncle Stickey is restrained. Uh, by what?
Cassidy: Oh, just roots that burst up out of the ground.
Lilith: Ok, ok!
Amanda: Alright.
Cassidy: Yeah, just some classic Nature magic shit.
Lilith: [Grunts] You’ve absolutely ruined my stage! Unhand me!
Cassidy: Well… You said we had to fight you, and you can’t fight anymore. So I think that means we win?
Lilith: Well, it would seem that you have bested The Wizard. And therefore you get to keep your items. Good job everyone.
Cassidy: Thank you! K I’ll dismiss the spell.
Lilith: You can tell he’s clearly not used to losing. This is….
Syd: Elektra still wants to come at him with her bat. But stops herself at the last moment. She’s still very pissed off about him fucking with her gear.
Amanda: [Giggles]
Lilith: He flinches. Y-you can turn it back on dear it was just a spell…
Syd: It’s the principle.
Lilith: Apologies. You did hit me in the face already so….
Amanda: Yeah I only got to hit him like, once!
Cassidy: I only hit him twice, but it counted.
Amanda: Yeah…
Lilith: Y-Yeah it really counts a lot when you hit, it counts A Lot Mikey. That was pretty fucked up, it was viscerally terrifying. Well, anyway….
Cassidy: I’m sorry.
Amanda: [chuckles]
Lilith: I guess you are now uh…
Amanda: Did you just call him Mickey?
Cassidy: My name’s Mikey.
Lilith: Did I, Mikey, did I say Mickey?
Cassidy: With an ‘e’.
Lilith: Got it, got It. Won’t happen again.
Amanda: Yeah, better not.
Lilith: Hm. Seems… Okay, there’s a weird energy building in this room.
Amanda: [Giggles]
Syd: Yeah Elektra’s, she’s put away her bat, but….
Lilith: I really don’t know what you all are complaining about, you uh, left my niece quite battered and bruised and–
Amanda: Have you thought about that maybe we’re not into this kind of sadistic activity just to join a discount club, or whatever the fuck you’re offering? Like…
Syd: I didn’t lay a hand on Bernice!
Lilith: It’s a treasure club, and you did this out of your own free will!
Syd: That’s true.…
Amanda: I mean, you did kind of hold us financially captive, so…. Like I can’t not keep this hammer.
Lilith: W-well the purchases, I mean…
Syd: Yeah we don’t get that money back.
Lilith: That’s the rules of the Treasure Club! I explained it before you bought anything, I was very clear about it.
Amanda: You’re acting as-… Yes ok, I’m not gonna fight this guy. I, look…
Cassidy: I mean we already did fight him and he lost.
Lilith: We’re up to code, we’ve got-… You want to contact the bet, b-[stammers]
Amanda: Try again! Take a second one?
Lilith: [Chuckles]
Cassidy: What’s a ‘Better Business Bureau’?
Amanda: It’s a very, very deep hole where we put all the capitalists.
[Assorted giggling]
Cassidy: Oh! What’s a capitalist?
Amanda: You don’t wanna know. Continue, Dr. Stickey, for the love of god, please.
Lilith: [Laughs] Well, um, I guess you’re all free to go, any time you–
Cassidy: Did you just call him DOCTOR Stickey?!?
Lilith: S-She did.
[More Laughter]
Cassidy: OK. Just checking.
Lilith: I was gonna let it go but uh, I kind of enjoyed being called that.
Amanda: Just really, throwing around surnames… No, no. I’m not going to call you that.
Lilith: [Laughs] Well, um–
Amanda: And for the record, we should have been ALWAYS free to go, because you shouldn’t have been holding us captive against our will!
Lilith: You can put down your items at any time, but in order to keep the items- I really don’t see what’s unclear about that. ANYWAY!
Cassidy: So did we win or not?
Amanda: We did.
Lilith: You won! Jeez!
Cassidy: What did we win…? Oh…
Lilith: You won the things you already got! I know it’s a difficult system to wrap your head around but–
Cassidy: I thought there was a prize at the end….
Amanda: But I think we also get to shop at his spots and buy cool other magic shit, is that correct?
Lilith: Yes! Any time you see another Uncle Stickey’s franchise in your travels across this nation you can stop in, have a chat with us, we’re always happy to say hello! Even to you. And you can purchase from Uncle Stickey’s Treasure Club?
Syd: Do we get a special… card to identify that?
Lilith: No, I’ll remember you. There’s not a whole lot of people at Uncle Stickey’s Treasure Club, I am Uncle Stickey.
Syd: How are you… You made it sound like….
Amanda: So wait, so this is basically a club full of people who have kicked personally your ass?
Lilith: Y’know, I usually don’t think about it that way, but uh, I guess that’s right.
Syd: You made it sound like there’s multiple ones, across….
Lilith: Yeah there is! Like I said, lot of franchises.
Syd: But if you’re not there….
Lilith: No I will. I will be.
Amanda & Syd: [Chuckling]
Amanda: Oh this is one of THOSE things isn’t it? Just one of those things.
Lilith: I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.
Amanda: Well it’s just been a long week, I’m just going to put it that way.
Lilith: OK, alright, alright, well… Did you want to maybe get the fuck out of my place of business?!?
Cassidy: Yeah, ok.
Amanda: Jesus. We’re paying customers.
Lilith: Yes, well you’re paying in punching customers.
Syd: We do have to…
Cassidy: He started it.
Syd: Things to do…
Lilith: That’s fair. That’s fair. You can–
Amanda: We do have a few things to do.
Lilith: There’s a door over there that goes up a staircase that Bernice, she’ll show you out.
Syd: B-Ber-[Stammers] I was about to say, is Bernice still in the room.
Lilith: Bernice left before the fight.
Syd: [softly] Ahkay… Well, I guess we’ll start heading out… Smell ya later, gramps!
Lilith: Oh that, I feel like that negativity was uncalled for!
Cassidy: I’m sorry I punched you in the face. And bit you.
Lilith: I–
Amanda: I’m not.
Cassidy: Well I am.
Lilith: [Snickers] I’m sorry I cast all those spells at you guys.
Cassidy: That’s ok.
Lilith: Sorry none of them worked… He seems really down.
Amanda: Yeah!
Cassidy: I use my last spell slot to cast Cure Light Wounds on Uncle Stickey.
Everyone: Awwww.
Cassidy: There you go! Hope you feel better.
Lilith: Oh, th-thanks! Thanks Mikey.
Cassidy: You’re welcome!
Lilith: He’s kinda, he’s now crying, softly.
Amanda: Oh dear. This is just extremely uncomfortable for me as a person. Petua walks out.
Lilith: Ok you pass Bernice who does not seem to be paying much attention at all and you go back out into the parking lot. Your winnebago is parked where it was before. Um… Yeah!
Cassidy: Soooo nobody’s going to comment on Mikey still not wearing pants?
Lilith: I was…
Syd: Oh.
Amanda: It’s a very big pug t-shirt isn’t it?
Cassidy: Yeah it’s like… I imagine it’s at least to his knees.
Amanda: His ass isn’t out that’s all that matters.
Cassidy: No, no.
Syd: We… should get you more pants though. Do you have any more pants in your winnebago?
Cassidy: I dunno. Probably.
Amanda: Let’s check it out. Let’s look for pants. Oh look! It’s as if we had another member of the party who left and left his pants as well.
Cassidy: I mean I think we should probably just explore the contents of what’s IN the winnebago just because Mikey’s never actually looked.
Amanda: [Rolls Dice] I got an 11.
Cassidy: [Snickers] Roll for ‘Detect Pants’ or… what?
Amanda: Yeah.
Lilith: You definitely find some pants. Congratulations you found the pants.
Amanda: Nice.
Cassidy: Ok. Do they clash with the pug T-Shirt?
Syd: Ooooh.
Amanda: I could honestly see Mikey wearing some loose-fitting yoga pants. Under the–
Cassidy: Wearing what?
Amanda: Like a nice comfortable pants that aren’t slacks? I feel like Mikey isn’t a slacks kinda guy.
Cassidy: Yeah, I feel like–
Syd: Did you say yoga pants?
Amanda: Not Yoga Pants but like… I’m so sorry you guys.
Lilith: Okay…
Amanda: Forget I said this, I didn’t mean to start pants discourse, I’m sorry.
Lilith: No it’s good.
Syd: Elektra immediately goes to just like, sit’s down and just like, wiring the compressor into her amp.
Lilith: Cool.
Amanda: Nice. Petua sits down and chomps on a bagel, even though she doesn’t need to but, I’m hungry so… Has a glass of water.
Syd: Hey, we’ve got a limit per day of those.
Cassidy: Can I have one of those?
Amanda: Alright can I eat a non-magical bagel?
Syd: [Softly Chuckles]
Lilith: I mean, yeah sure. You find some tortillas that the family that Mikey stole the winnebago from.
Amanda: Oh, hello…. Noooo.
Lilith: Yeah, there you go. And there’s a bag of cheddar cheese; that’s what white people camp with.
Amanda: I am not putting that into my body because it’s been in a car for a very long time. I throw the cheese out the window, it’s desert cheese now.
Lilith: [in mock incredulity] What? That’s a waste! I mean, if it wasn’t moldy.
Cassidy: I was eating that!
Lilith: Yeah, if it wasn’t moldy.
Amanda: It was, right?
Cassidy: Oh yeah, it was moldy.
Lilith: Oh. Well…
Cassidy: So where to now?
Amanda: Yeah, where to now?
Syd: I guess keep driving to Arizona?
Lilith: Uh, so, the radio turns on once more.
Amanda: Of course it does.
Lilith: [voice caked in radio distortion] Yeah, and… Hey Guys! It’s Luci, I’m really–
Cassidy: Hey Luci.
Lilith: Hey, Mikey. How are you?
Cassidy: Good.
Syd: Luci?
Cassidy: I ripped my pants…. But I got this cool t-shirt!
Lilith: Oh, well that’s. you get him other pants?
Amanda: We have pants.
Lilith: Ok good.
Cassidy: [stumbling over words in excitement] I got this T-shirt, it’s a really, it’s a really good t-shirt. It’s a really good shirt. It’s got like, a dog’s face? But it’s like, the whole shirt.
Lilith: That’s….
Syd: It’s a sick ass shirt.
Cassidy: It’s really good I wish that you could see it.
Lilith: I’m… I hope I see that next time I see y’all. That’s really great. I know, kinda got complaints with the last… the last assignment was kinda vague instructions right? Well–
Amanda: Yeah, everything is kinda been pretty vague.
Lilith: Everything’s been vague, I know. I’ve got a lot more, well… I hear, so there’s these things called websites. And uh, I don’t know if you’ve heard of them?
Cassidy: What’s a website?
Amanda: [icily] We’re familiar.
Cassidy: I’m not!
Lilith: I’ve heard a little bit about them from the world of the living. I, I’ll tell ya Mikey, I’m not really the best person to explain it. Maybe Elektra or Petua could give you a rundown on what a ‘web site’ is. But I’ve got one for y’all that, it’s gonna be all you’re gonna need for your next journey… Yeah.
Amanda: Well shit, alright. Can we have it now?
Lilith: Yeah yeah yeah, if you got like a web browser open, you can, here I’ve got the address in front of me right here.
Syd: Elektra’s looking at her phone.
Lilith: It’s H, T, T, P, colon–
Syd: You can skip that.
Lilith: Forward slash! Forward slash!
Syd: Y-you can…
Lilith: I, S-A-W, T-H-E, A-R-I-Z-O-N-A, L-I-G-H-T-S, Dot T K.
Amanda: Could you repeat that… ?
Lilith: It’s “isawthearizonalights.tk”.
Syd: … Oh shit.
Lilith: Yeah, and if y’all at home want to pull that up on your browser…
Amanda: Oh shit!
Lilith: The radio shuts off.
Syd: [mutters various phrases under her breath such as ‘State’s Witness’, ‘Conspiracy’, ‘Bent Fork’ and others as she reads]
Cassidy: What’s a website?
Amanda: Well Mikey, there’s a lot of information out in the uh, the internet. Oh god, this is not…
Cassidy: What’s the internet?
Amanda: It’s like a connected network. Kind of like, um… Trying to think of a nature metaphor that works.
Cassidy: Like TV?
Amanda: Yeah, like imagine if every TV could talk to every other TV.
Cassidy: Oh ok. Like kinda like a phone.
Syd: [murmuring] That’s not good….
Amanda: Yeah, it’s like a phone and a TV. And also a library. And um… a couple of other things. We’ll show it to you some time, there’s some cool stuff there! Elektra, what are you up to.
Syd: [murmurs then clears her throat] There’s some strange shit! Let’s see… Personal web domain of Alex Andre Curtis
Lilith: It’s Alexandra.
Syd: Ahhh, Alexandra Curtis. State’s witness against the deep state conspiracy to suppress the truth around the secret bomb tests that took place outside Bent Fork, Arizona 1947. “Codename BBQ, now that’s cute. Is the only known Nuclear Test on human subjects, that’s not cute, within the borders of the united states. I have lived in the Big Fork area for 14 years. I frequently see strange lights coming from the area that the tests took place. And there’s some pictures… Oh wait, it’s still scrolling, it’s still scrolling… Fine me. Huh.

It’s the fury of the storm

It’s the growing of the dark
It’s the thrive of decay
It’s the voice of woe
It’s the call of the moon
