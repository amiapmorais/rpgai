"Soft Cheese: The Quest For Fikarra (Pt. 2)","Soft Cheese: The Quest For Fikarra (Pt. 2)
Inside the high-class party of Darius Vain, the unlikely trio of Parax, Lorzatch, and Dizzy are thoroughly out of place. As they try to acclimate to their surroundings, and search for the hidden vault containing the secret to Fikarra’s restoration, one thought stays in the back of their mind: before the night is over, someone has to die.

As a hidden threat looms over Ravnica, the party learns there may be hope in restoring their friend, Fikarra. Parax and Lorzatch set out in search of an artifact collector whose lavish parties hold the key to life and death. Intrigue, deception, breaking and entering; all it takes is a touch of class.

Brian 0:25
Last time on Encounter Party! Escaping the quarantine, our players continue on the trail of clues left by Malfus Reid. Thanks to Zenia's questionable brilliance, our players discover a lost Izzet research tower teleporting out of control. Having navigated its homemade traps, the crew is now face-to-face with its Goblin inhabitant. Will madness prevail? Find out this week on Encounter Party!
Brian 1:08
Hello everyone and welcome to the Encounter Party. My name is Brian David Judkins. I am your Dungeon Master. With me this week are Andrew Krug, Eddie Cooper Ned Donovan, Sarah Band Landree Fleming.
Right. so the mighty Minotaur Fikkara kicks down the door and inside, exposed, you can see that the top of the tower is actually an Izzet laboratory. And this place is in shambles, complete disrepair. There's lab equipment everywhere, piles of paper and research notes are scattered all over the floor, empty food bins and coffee or tea cups kind of littered everywhere. But there is still this sort of pungent smell of pure Izzet brilliance hanging in the air. On the back wall, you can see movement stirring amongst piles of notes and papers. Huddled on the back wall is a small, frail, bookish looking Goblin who has what is clearly some sort of pistol-like device pointed at you guys and it's just 'click click click click' as it is either misfiring or not working but whatever he's pointing at you is not happening. And he sort of panics and tries to get up and run away but he kind of slips on the papers and falls back in before realizing that there's no way out just squeals at you with this panicked, 'What do you want? Who are you? You are not me! Why are you here?!'
Landree 2:33
'Please. we're not. we're not here to attack you or do anything to your inventions-'
Sarah 2:40
'She's not here to attack you. I might do something to you.'
Ned 2:43
'Oh!'
Landree 2:43
'We're simply here looking for information. There's a great deal of disaster happening in Ravnica. Um, we're worried about a contamination. And so we're just here looking for answers.'
Brian 2:55
'You're not here to harm me?'
Landree 2:57
'No.'
Brian 2:57
'Well, that's a relief. I was trying to defend myself. I thought this was some sort of Death Ray but now I believe it to be a tea infusion device. Um. Oh, you're big.'
Sarah 3:11
'Yeah.'
Brian 3:11
'I'm sorry. How can I help you?
Landree 3:14
'Well, we're here on a fact finding mission truly. So basically, Malfus Reid, the Master Researcher.'
Brian 3:23
'Oh!'
Landree 3:23
'Yes.'
Brian 3:24
There's a great deal of recognition in this Goblin's 'guh!'
Sarah 3:29
David West.
Ned 3:30
Goblin throws in 'oh!' in the middle.
Brian 3:33
There's this great deal of recognition at the name Malfus Reid.
Landree 3:37
'Yes, you're familiar. Um, has been essentially teleporting a great deal of energy,um, and we were seeking out the location of said energy and it brought us here.'
Brian 3:49
'Oh, well naturally! He is not teleporting. I am teleporting it. It is powering my tower!'
Andrew 3:55
'And what does the tower do?'
Brian 3:57
'I, um, I don't really remember.'
Sarah 4:01
'It teleports...'
Brian 4:02
'It teleports!'
Landree 4:04
'That's excellent. It does it very well.'
Brian 4:06
'I'm actually quite impressed myself. Thank you very much.'
Ned 4:09
'What are you doing now?'
Landree 4:10
'What? What am I doing now? Um, research?'
Ned 4:15
'On?'
Sarah 4:16
'Teleporting.'
Brian 4:17
'Am I? Apparently I'm doing research on teleporting?'
Ned 4:21
'Do you have a name, Goblin?'
Brian 4:22
'Yes, I do. Somewhere. Perhaps there was a piece of paper who can enlighten us on that bit of information.' Please make an Perception or Investigation to sort through the paper. Zenia, you can make it with advantage.
Eddie 4:38
'I do not find it.'
Ned 4:41
'Guys, I'm really nervous for next combat. That's a double nat 20 on my- '(laughter)'
Landree 4:46
Oh my God.
Sarah 4:48
Okay.
Brian 4:49
Oh, you wasted it!
Ned 4:50
On the most useless of checks!
Brian 4:51
To find a name.
Landree 4:55
Yeah, I mean, I had 18, but you had a double nat so- '(laughter)'
Sarah 4:59
It's all right, I got a five.
Ned 5:01
Okay.
Brian 5:03
You find some like letters and correspondence with a name that looks Goblin-esque and you just sort of like- It looks strange. And you really hope this isn't his name. But Izzet his name?
Landree 5:16
Ha!
Ned 5:18
The double finger guns do not impress me, Brian. Thank you.
Brian 5:22
So you bring this piece of paper over to this like smarmy Goblin who kind of looks at it and goes, 'Oh, hmmm. Oh, yes, I remember now. I am the immeasurable, the incomparable, the- I suspect currently unemployed Dr. Fizzlegig Whirlygear!'
Eddie 5:39
'(shrieking laughter)'
Ned 5:41
Absofuckinglutely not! Oh, okay.
Eddie 5:46
Lennox goes, 'HA!'
Sarah 5:49
Dr. Fizzygig?
Ned 5:50
Whirlygear?
Brian 5:50
Fizzlegig Whirlygear.
Sarah 5:51
Whirlygear.
Ned 5:53
Yo, I bought that toy as a kid.
Landree 5:55
What a fantastically descriptive name.
Brian 5:59
Whirlygear has kind of regained his confidence as he, sort of like, stands up and seems to kind of like remember that this might be his place. Doesn't really remember what he was doing and where he was, and just sort of sifting through stuff sort of trying to reestablish himself and he acknowledges you but also doesn't really acknowledge you when you get the frightening realization that this man is a little bit more despondent and random than Zenia herself.
Landree 6:22
'(chuckles)'
Ned 6:23
As a researcher, can I attempt to help him learn what he is trying to put back together?
Brian 6:28
I'm going to say no, because you are a Simic. And not an Izzet. And also there doesn't necessarily to be any amount of organization between what he's doing.
Landree 6:38
In that case since I am Izzet, am I able to maybe get him to focus in such a way or show me around his. his lab in such a way that I can kind of gather where he's at?
Brian 6:50
Yeah, I think you're able to sort of match the sort of manic energy that goes with most Izzet. In your- you're trying to help him sort of rediscover what's going on. And he kind of travels to each particular station just goes, 'Oh, what do I have here? Oh yes, these are solutions and lubrication. Teleportation will be very dangerous situation.' And he kind of rolls over here and just goes, 'These beakers are- Oh, this is just beverages. I make tea in here. Always tea. never coffee. Gives me the shakes! And then kind of like keeps moving around and sort of thing and putting on little bits here and there of sort of vials and papers and researches and some sort of Tesla coil type devices here and electricity and a cage of possibly what contained a rodent of some time once and he goes, 'Oh yes. Kept escaping so I thought. Turns out it was teleporting itself. Discovered it before I did, the little rascal!' And then kind of like keeps like, sort of lingering around. It's just sort of like bits and pieces of research that very clearly he is involved in the School of Spatial Recombination or teleportation.
Landree 7:54
'Um, so you of course know who Malfus Reid is.'
Brian 7:57
'Yes, I do.'
Landree 7:58
'Yes. Have you had- Have you worked with him at all?
Brian 8:01
'Yes, we were research partners.'
Landree 8:03
'Were you specifically research partners on teleportation?'
Brian 8:06
'Yes, we were.'
Landree 8:07
'Okay. Did he ever mention anything about an orb?'
Brian 8:10
'Yes. Oh, well, that's what we were working on.'
Landree 8:14
'Can you explain a little bit more? What were you working on with the orb?'
Brian 8:18
'Um, I don't exactly remember. Master Researcher Reid brought me on to do some research on an object he found and somehow it dealt with teleportation. And, well, you know how these sort of research things go and then next thing you know you're vaporizing friends and taking people's cats and sending them into the stratosphere and it's all a bit of a jumblelation. I'm sure the notes around here somewhere.'
Ned 8:39
In Vidalken, can I ask Zenia to ask him the last time he saw Malfus Reid?
Landree 8:43
'When was the last time you saw Malfus Reid?""
Brian 8:46
'Oh, our research ended, um...What year is it?'
You guys, you guys happen to, like, clarify what the year is.
'It's been, um, about three four years I imagine. Ooh, the time does fly.'
Ned 9:02
'And how long did they say that Malfus Reid was the head of the Izzet research facility? When did he get appointed?'
Sarah 9:08
'About three years ago?'
Ned 9:09
'Is it possible that he lost this little Goblin and was trying to find it?'
Landree 9:15
'It's possible.'
Ned 9:16
'He was staring at the power grid for hours on end.'
Sarah 9:19
'Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.'
Landree 9:21
'That's true.'
Sarah 9:21
'Because all of his research is probably on there.'
Landree 9:24
'So the research about the orbits probably here.'
Ned 9:26
'Yes.'
Landree 9:26
'Yes. Um, would you mind terribly if I sorted through all of your things?'
Brian 9:36
Whirlygig might be crazy, but he kind of like, takes back- he kinda like takes a bit back and says, 'I'm sorry, are you an assistant?'
Landree 9:43
'In a matter of speaking, yes.'
Brian 9:45
Roll a Persuasion check.
Sarah 9:47
Do you want help with that?
Landree 9:48
Yeah, please.
Sarah 9:49
I will help-
Brian 9:49
That is not a possibility because she's trying to convince an old man that she is his researcher.
Sarah 9:54
Nevermind!
Landree 10:04
Nat 20 plus five, so 25.
Brian 10:07
This old spatial Goblin who was clearly working on something probably horribly dangerous. He's just completely convinced that he forgot you were his researcher.
'Oh, I am so sorry. I'm so embarrassed. What is your name again, my dear?'
Landree 10:26
'Zenia, and it's totally fine. I've missed you. It's been a minute.'
Brian 10:29
'Oh, Zenia. I'm sorry. I keep forgetting my researchers all the time. Where is my tea?'
Ned 10:35
Point to the beakers.
Landree 10:38
'Yes, in those beakers.'
Brian 10:39
'Oh, thank you. Do please bring me a cup. Now if I remember. you were discussing something about an orb. Oh, yes. The orb! Ooh, the orb...'
And he kind of gets like very quiet and kind of just freezes there for a second as he at least has enough awareness and clarity at the subject of the orb to realize the four of you are not not Izzet guild members and are definitely not anyone that he knows.
Ned 11:04
I would pass in Elvish to the Golgari that we might want to produce the orb.
Andrew 11:10
And Lorzatch reluctantly pulls the box from his backpack, opens it to reveal the orb.
Brian 11:18
'Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where did you get this.'
Ned 11:24
'Zenia?'
Landree 11:24
'Good gracious. Well, it has made quite a long journey. But it first appeared in the Simicand then was given to a Mr. Alfonso, which was then stolen.'
Brian 11:36
'Uh, the Simic? How? Where?!' He's growing like increasingly, like, frightened by everyone.
Ned 11:41
'It was found at the bottom of the Simic well below Zonnet Four.'
Brian 11:45
'Oh no.'
Andrew 11:45
'Inside the belly of an adaptive black krasis that resembled some sort of sentient goo.'
Brian 11:51
'Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.!' And he just starts like pacing around the, frightening, 'Don't- Oh, no. Oh, this is horrible. This is horrible. Don't you know what this means? No. Of course you don't. That's why they're here.'
Sarah 12:05
'Yeah.'
Brian 12:05
'It means there's more than one.'
Ned 12:07
'What?'
Brian 12:08
'They are more than one of these. This cannot be the one that we were studying. It was abandoned in the facility.'
Ned 12:15
'What facility?'
Brian 12:16
'Oh, a research lab. Malfus and I had our own private research lab. We were conducting this research privately in secret.'
Landree 12:23
'In the Izzet compound?'
Brian 12:24
'Oh, no, no, a private facility. Far too obvious! My dear, you must be new.'
Ned 12:32
'And you don't think that it's possible that the orb you were working on that Malfus Reid seems to have lost or you seem to have lost could have ended up at the bottom of the Simic well?'
Brian 12:40
'Oh, you Simic and your simple ideas. I guarantee you-' and he gets a little sinister here, 'I promise on the scales of the Firemind: There is no one except for Mizzet himself who would be able to find that. No, no, no, we are all in a great deal of trouble because that to my knowledge is orb number two.'
Landree 13:08
'How many orbs are there?'
Brian 13:10
'My dear? As I have just said, that would be orb number two.'
Ned 13:17
'Of two?'
Brian 13:18
'Two. I am just now aware that there are more than one orb.'
Eddie 13:26
'What does this orb do?'
Brian 13:30
'May I see it?'
Andrew 13:31
'I don't advise touching it with your bare hands.'
Brian 13:33
'Yes, I know.' He kind of like shores the sleeves of his of. his robe kind of down and takes the orb from you. And this orb is kind of like about the size of his head as he sort of holds it up in front of him like a little butler just sort of waddling over to sort of this big glass orb contraption thing in the middle of his room.
He says, 'Now, I'm not exactly sure how to explain this so do your best to follow along.'
Sarah 13:59
'Oh God.'
Brian 14:00
'This isn't.'
Ned 14:03
'You're going to need to explain more than that.'
Brian 14:06
'Yes, I'm sorry. I will try this again. This orb is not.'
Ned 14:13
'What?'
Andrew 14:13
'It does not exist.'
Brian 14:16
'Exactly. Yes. Well, at least not here. I mean, it is. It exists. It is here correct. But it does not exist here. It is not from Ravnica. It is from somewhere else..'
Landree 14:28
'Where else?'
Brian 14:29
'I don't know.'
Landree 14:29
'You don't know.'
Brian 14:32
'Perhaps a demonstration.' And he's kind of hustling back over to the side of the room where this contraption is and he just sort of or- opens one of the portholes to this sort of bubbling goo. And he just, very gently, just sort of places the orb inside and closes it.
And he says, 'Now, suspended in this solution. Um, I am going to reduce the pressure on the orb and, um, we will see what happens. I mean, I already know what happens, butI'm going to show it for you. So he kind of go to this contraption. There's this big wheel. Steam wheel and you hear the '(mechnical groaning sounds)' as he's like slowly turning this thing.
And you see the solution in which this orbit suspended starting to bubble. And he gets very, very excited.
'Do you see?'
Andrew 15:23
'It's boiling?'
Brian 15:27
'Yes.'
Sarah 15:27
'Wow.'
Brian 15:27
'Oh. Do you understand what this means?'
Eddie 15:30
'Explain this to me as if you are talking to a child.'
Brian 15:34
'Yes. It is cold to the touch. And yet we reduce the pressure and the water boils. That means?'
Sarah 15:42
'The pressure where it is existing is different from ours?'
Brian 15:47
'It means it's hot.'
'It's hot. Whatever this is, it is hot, it is radiating heat. Have you noticed it hasn't frozen anything around it? Coldto the touch, yes, but only relative to the atmosphere of Ravnica. Wherever this thing is from is much colder than here. So much so that the temperature it is radiating is actually hot in relative to wherever this comes from. But more importantly, it is radiating energy. Heat is energy, but it is siphoning. This object came here for whatever reason and now there are more than one which means that there's not just a singular device. It is a deliberate plant. Something or someone has placed these orbs within Ravnica with the intent desire to radiate energy, heat, but we are already hot here. We are much warmer than the energy this is radiating out into us. So with a great deal of time, Malfus and I concluded that it is not trying to pump energy into us so much as it is trying to vent heat from wherever it comes from.'
Sarah 15:50
'Well yeah.'
Ned 17:00
'Where did you find the first orb?'
Brian 17:02
'I did not.
Ned 17:03
'Who did?'
Brian 17:04
'From my understanding Mr. Malfus Reid got his hand on it.'
Ned 17:06
'Did he tell you where he found it?'
Brian 17:09
'It never mattered.'
Landree 17:11
'When you mentioned the Firemind earlier, were you implying that he has the other orb?'
Brian 17:18
'No, my dear. We had a research facility in a hidden location where we could study such a dangerous and mind boggling device on our own. Clearly, the Firemind probably had an inclination as to what we were studying. But as far as sharing our research, I was under the role of Second Researcher to Malfus Reid. I was really quite admiring the man and really quite honored that he asked me to join him on the first place. But that facility lost its research, we had no more funding, and it was not the type of situation we sort of call out into the verse and say, ""Hey, we certainly could use some money to study what we think is an interdimensional object."" So we just sort of ceased. But as far as we got in our research to begin with, it is from somewhere not from Ravnica, and it is intentionally venting heat into our plane in order to remove it from wherever it's from.'
Andrew 18:12
'And the other would still be at that facility?'
Brian 18:16
'Yes.'
Ned 18:16
'And where is that facility?'
Brian 18:18
'Oh. That is a very good question.'
Ned 18:19
'Can you control the teleportation of this tower?'
Brian 18:23
'No, I have not left in four years.'
Ned 18:25
'Did you design the tower to move like this? Or is there a problem?'
Brian 18:28
'Knowing the results of my past work, I imagined I screwed something up somewhere.'
Ned 18:33
'Would you have your old notes from your old facility?'
Brian 18:36
'All of the notes were maintained in the facility. Less likely if somebody tried to steal them that way.'
Ned 18:40
'So you have no notes that would help us find that first facility.'
Brian 18:44
'I imagine there's something somewhere.'
Landree 18:45
'Which leads me back to my original question of sorting through your things as your assistant.'
Brian 18:52
'Mmm. Good luck.'
So as as the worry sets in with the party, Doctor Fizzlegig Whirlygear kind of looks around and realizes that perhaps he needs to be of assistance in some way.
'It appears that we need to find a way to get you to the old research center. And how we are going to do that I'm not entirely sure. But I imagine with some help from my, I think I remember very helpful assistant? I'm sure between the two of us, we can figure out how to do this. So make yourselves as comfortable as I think you can and it's bound to be a long night.'
AD BREAK
Brian 20:07
Seemingly trapped inside of a rapid teleporting tower, the party searches through the remains of the research lab that is the very eccentric Goblin Doctor Fizzlegig Whirlygear, trying to find a way to simultaneously get out of this tower but also teleporting directly to an Izzet research facility completely off the map. As the party discovers that the orbs placement within Ravnica is purposeful and numerous, the question now becomes 'why was Malfus Reid attempting to collect them?' You guys will experience the benefit of a long rest as you will be hanging out in this tower for a little while. You are all now also level four so congratulations. Please level up your characters.
Eddie 20:57
Power!
Brian 20:58
Power. While you guys are doing that and you're hanging out and you're resting, thankfully you have your Izzet companion Zenia with you. And one of the things that's great is Zenia is from- which level of- what area of study are you from?
Landree 21:13
Storms and Electricity.
Brian 21:14
Storms and Electricity. So power conversion is part of her college within the Izzet which happens to be incredibly convenient from the point of a DM/storywriter because she kind of has all the skills necessary to help Dr. Fizzlegig Whirlygear figure out exactly what he's missing as far as converting the power within his tower into a teleportation necessary to bring you guys directly to this secret lab that you're trying to find where he and Malfus Reid were studying one of these orbs. Landree, as Zenia, would you please give me an Intelligence check? With advantage.
Landree 21:48
Thank you.
Eddie 21:55
From a 2 to a 20.
Brian 21:58
A natural 20. That is going to cut- no this is great because I just rolled the D 12. You guys have cut 10 hours off of the time required for you to kind of figure this out. So that natural 20 is amazing because that really kind of cues in in this sort of like super focus of, 'look, old Goblin dude who's been alone in this place for several years, your shit is a mess.' And using her powers of, you know, basic research, just basics, just basics. Sometimes she gets so smart, you get so creative studying things from other dimensions that you just forget that A plus B equals C. And she just very quickly kind of cleans everything up while you guys are resting.
So by the time you guys are finished leveling yourselves up. By the time you finish the long rest, only about six to eight hours later, you guys have watched them clean up a bunch of papers, do a little bit of speed reading, do a little playing with some beakers, unplugging some vents, replugging into other events, and in a seemingly inexhaustable amount of energy, the two of them finish with a sort of arms crossed back to back, 'Yeah., we did it!' As they proudly show to you everything they did, which to your eyes doesn't really look like they did very much anything. But Whirlygear is assured that he can now take you directly to that secret lab.
'I would get into the specifics of what we are doing. But I imagine that you are going to be boggled by the mind.' '(ahas)'
Landree 23:42
'(ahas larger)'
Brian 23:42
'(ahas even larger)'
Sarah 23:43
'(uncontrollable laughter)'
Ned 23:44
Is that our first snort of the podcast? There it is. Not our first snort of the podcast? Thank you, Will!
Andrew 23:56
Maniacal laughter break.
Brian 23:59
I'm so glad that made it in.
Andrew 24:00
Pretty good.
Brian 24:02
So- sorry, I need a second that was so good.
'So if you all would please get your things and meet me downstairs and, um, I will point out some of my traps, please do mind them.'
Ned 24:14
'Uh, will we be able to get- will this continue bouncing around the landscape randomly? Like will we be able to get back to you once we leave?'
Brian 24:22
'Oh, I'm sorry, my boy, I am not exactly sure that I know how to stop that at the moment. Now that I'm actually sure that I want to. I kind of enjoy the solitarity these days. However, you will have a brief window with which you may exit to the exact location of the lab. Say, approximately, 2.87 seconds.'
Ned 24:39
It seems like this would be a good place hypothetically to leave the orb if we could find it again.
Brian 24:43
It seems like you will not be back here.
Ned 24:46
Great. No home base that you- no one can find. Dammit.
Brian 24:50
It is going to be a sort of a- another frightening ordeal as you will have a brief window to actually pop into the exact place you want to be and get off this crazy thing.
Ned 25:03
Without any confirmation.
Brian 25:04
Before it, before it zips off to this continual sort of pocket that it keeps sort of bouncing around every few seconds in some sort of weird teleportation catastrophe that Whirlygear now seems perfectly content with.
Andrew 25:19
Lorzatch has packed away the orb in his backpack, finishes polishing his blade, sheaths it, and heads downstairs.
Landree 25:27
'Master Whirlygear, it has been an absolute pleasure assisting you once again, like I definitely did before for quite some time.'
Brian 25:35
'Oh, I will be so sorry to see you go. It's been great these past many years having you around to do whatever it is that you've been doing.'
Landree 25:43
'So many things.'
Brian 25:44
'If you ever need a letter of recommendation for any of your future colleges, just feel free to ring me up sometime.'
'Thank you so much.'
Ned 25:52
Is that a thing?
Brian 25:52
Yeah, but I mean, he's not gonna be around to like-
Landree 25:57
No.
Brian 25:57
That is a thing, but you're not gonna be able to get ahold of him.
Ned 25:59
This is my point. It's like, can we get a hold of him?
Brian 26:01
It is a sincere promise that he cannot deliver on because he forgets.
Landree 26:05
'Yes, I anticipate never seeing you again. Thank you so much.'
Brian 26:08
'Oh, but that is the way of things. Perhaps if one of those nut jobs over at the Temporal College figure out time travel without any sort of major complication, we might have a chance to see each other at a younger day. Oh! We don't have much time. Pleaes, hurry downstairs!'
Ned 26:26
Downstairs?
Sarah 26:26
There we go.
Brian 26:28
You guys head downstairs towards one of the doors. Which one of the doors did we like not break?
Sarah 26:35
We didn't break any doors!
Ned 26:36
My door got opened.
Eddie 26:38
I opened mine.
Brian 26:38
Ned, your door was the ice trap.
Ned 26:40
Ice trap!
Brian 26:40
But the actual door was trapped.
Ned 26:43
No, yeah, the door wasn't trapped. The floor in front of the door was trapped.
Brian 26:45
Great. So they're going to leave through that door.
'Mind the ice.' And, uh, you guys, you guys kinda walk out onto the floor. And there is this sort of like railing catwalk that just sort of extends around the base of the tower. And it is incredibly disorienting as the landscape that you're looking at shifts every couple of seconds. Whirlygear sort of reaches under his big oversized robe and pulls out a clock that is quite literally the size of his face. It's confusing how he could've had something, this large statue underneath his robe without you seeing. And it kind of takes him both hands to hold it up. And he's not making any sounds or talking to anybody. He's just sort of looking at this clock with more hands than you think the clock needs, just sort of '(clock ticking sounds)' Into a kind of an indi-indiscernible amount of time. And then all of a sudden, without warning, without even any prep at all, he just goes, 'We're here!' And it's just like 'voom!' Everybody please make a Dexterity check right now. And don't fail.
Ned 26:46
Great.
Sarah 27:53
H-Hey Brian...
Brian 27:53
A natural 20 again?
Landree 27:55
Yeah.
Brian 27:55
Oh my God!
Ned 27:57
A natural one.
Brian 27:58
A natural one.
Eddie 28:00
Yeah, 5 for me.
Brian 28:01
Oh, ho, ho.
Unknown Speaker 28:03
Eight.
Brian 28:04
An eight. Okay, so Fikkara, Lennox and Parax kind of stumble out in a rather unfortunate way.
Sarah 28:12
Oh.
Brian 28:13
You will each take three points of bludgeoning damage as you fall on your face jumping about 10 feet down and not landing. Parax, the unfortunate thing is you rolled a one to which I think we need to be punished in some way. So I am going to say-
Ned 28:29
Okay, but like, no. We could not.
Brian 28:30
Yes, except this is an adventure and we're going to make an interesting- so I am going to say that your essentials, which would be your spell book and your focuses around your neck. So you probably had your spell book and your focus- your spellbook wrapped in your arms was the priority to reach but a natural one makes you hesitate just long enough that the back half of you disappears behind you.
Ned 28:31
Leaving only my spell book and my focus.
Brian 28:39
Right so whatever you had gear-wise: a backpack, items, gold, anything like that.
Ned 28:51
Give me a second to erase about 20 items.
Brian 28:53
Yeah, you didn't make it. You had a full two and a half seconds and you hesitated.
Ned 29:08
Okay, I lost my small knife.
Brian 29:10
I would say Ned, this thing where you let everyone else go first is starting to work against you.
Ned 29:15
Yeah, I noticed. So much for being friendly.
Brian 29:19
I appreciate the self-I appreciate the self sacrifice but you are getting punished.
Ned 29:23
Yes.
Landree 29:24
'Nice guys finish last, bitch.'
Ned 29:30
Meanwhile-
Landree 29:31
I love you.
Ned 29:31
'This means war, Izzet.'
Brian 29:35
Meanwhile, Zenia with a natural 20 seems to have this, like, teleportation thing down at this point. I unfortunately, I can't really reward you for sort of like a critical awesomeness. But we'll just say you look very impressively pretty while you're doing
Landree 29:51
Oh my goodness. Thank you so much.
Brian 29:55
Just sort of 'oof' on your face. Lorzatch is deft enough to just sort of jump down with somebody ability. Ned nearly gets his butt sliced off and-
Sarah 30:03
She does like a triple salchow.
Brian 30:05
And Zenia just sort of leaps down and goes, 'Oh, that was fun.' You find yourself in a side alley and in unknown part of Ravnica.
Ned 30:18
I have no gold anymore.
Brian 30:19
Yes, everything is gone.
Ned 30:20
Okay.
Andrew 30:21
Can we roll Survival to orient ourselves?
Brian 30:24
You can roll Survival to orient yourself. I will say with a disadvantage because you are in an alley, not even on a street. One of the difficult things is that you realize that the tower probably swapped spaces with a building somewhere just for a brief second and then swapped back.
Andrew 30:40
17
Brian 30:41
17, alright.
Sarah 30:42
15.
Landree 30:42
6.
Ned 30:43
15.
Landree 30:44
Geez, you guys are good.
Ned 30:45
I just rolled a one!
Brian 30:45
Um, I would say- I would say that based on the time of day, and based on the general positioning of certain sky landmarks, perhaps a floating island or here; you can ascertain that you are at least to the north of Zonnet Four. Exactly how far I don't know. And you are Northeast of where you had intended to meet up with Whirlygear's tower. So you are in the Northwest of Ravnica, near the edge of the city which is known as the Red Wastes. Still in the Third District. You're in a side alley, a boring alley, no discernible features. Exactly the type of place that somebody might hide something. There's no trash collection here. There's just a faint stream of wet running down the middle of this alley. There's no cats. There's no hobos, there's just nothing. It's like a place that just nobody would bother come to. Accessible, but just sort of out of sight for so many reasons.
Andrew 31:43
Roll Investigation to find what I imagine to be a hidden door.
Brian 31:46
Yes, please.
Ned 31:48
I'm joining him in that regard. With a natural one! I'm switching dice, everybody,
Landree 31:54
I got 23.
Brian 31:56
You're doing great. Zenia, rolling over 20. You're certainly crushing this episode. As everyone is sort of searching for things that they might interpret as a hidden entrance, you know that the Izzet are much more clever in hiding what they need to hide with codes and secrets and ciphers because the threat of having your research stolen, that is your life. That is your source to quality of life. So it's not just as simple as, 'Oh, this wall is actually a door.' There is going to be a little more complicated matter to that. You do see what happens to be a bit of a crevice that looks like it could be opened outward. Because you see what you suspect might be recesses for hinges.
Landree 32:42
'You can all stop wasting your time. I think I found it.'
Sarah 32:45
'Oh. Good.'
Landree 32:47
And I approach said crevice. And I, and I put my spindly little fingers in between and I try and pull it out.
Brian 32:54
Right so you can give me a Strength check if you would like.
Eddie 32:57
I say, 'Waitwaitwaitwhoawhoa. Hold up. Maybe we should investigate for traps.'
Brian 33:09
Maybe we should remember who our DM is and not die.
Landree 33:11
So far to fall. 'Yes, let's investigate.'
Zenia got far too cocky with how well this has been going.
Brian 33:18
I rolled a 20, a 20, and a 19 today. I'm unstoppable!
Ned 33:25
I'm running things!
Eddie 33:25
'I will assist you.'
Landree 33:29
'Thank you.' I got a 16 and, let's see, oh and a 21.
Brian 33:35
You can immediately ascertain that it's not just your lack of strength. But this is not simply a thing that you just kind of reach in and pull over. This needs to be open in a separate way.
Ned 33:47
So I'm going to begin investigating the surrounding area for a panel or a switch or lever something that would pop this door.
Eddie 33:53
I will assist.
Ned 33:55
This die is doing much better. That's a 22.
Brian 33:58
Great. You don't find anything.
Ned 34:00
Great.
I will guard the alley.
Brian 34:01
You are going to guard the alley. Please, guard the alley.
Andrew 34:03
We're looking for a key of some sort?
Brian 34:05
Nope, it just looks to be like a part of the wall that Zenia recognized is going to open outward like a window. It won't be pulled, it's clearly locked in some way. You cannot access the hinges from where you are. There is no suggestion of a panel that opens it on your side. There is no access to a keyhole. It is simply just the folded area of a flat.
Andrew 34:25
How
Eddie 34:25
What is it made out of?
Brian 34:27
It is part of the wall. So it would be a brick face.
Andrew 34:30
How, uh...how wide is this crevice?
Brian 34:34
I would say it's about the size of, like, a ticket window.
Andrew 34:37
And the seam between these two parts that would appear to open out, how much space is in that crevice?
Brian 34:44
Not, um...Go ahead. I know you're, I know you're trying to do. Please go ahead.
Andrew 34:52
Lorzatch will examine the door momentarily. And the muscles sort of seize in his neck and the air around him becomes suddenly agitated as the spores increase in volume and intensity and you watch as his armor and robes sort of sag around him as he shrinks and shrivels and where there once was an elf there is now a giant centipede that slithers its way in between the crevice of the door.
Brian 35:20
Gross.
You. you can feel immediately behind the door that there is sort of a recess that is, like, the size of a ticket booth. And there are some, some latches and some, um, you know, levers and gears. Please roll an Investigation to see whether or not you can kind of ascertain how you might be able to click this open.
Andrew 35:43
18.
Brian 35:43
Yeah, that's really good. So because you're a centipede and because you have sort of all these things reached out on different areas, you can go. 'Oh, okay, I can feel this is really just a panel opening. It's just meant to be opened by the inside.' But there is no physical latch, it's opened automatically. So you kind of stretch out here, reach here and click a leg there and poke something here and you can, you can feel something click and you feel some wheels start to turn and thankfully you're not immediately splattered from the inside of the door. You can very quickly sort of go, 'Oh!' and wiggle your way back out. Transforming I'm assuming back into your natural elven form.
And the panels to this door open. And as the panels to the door open, you hear a music track sort of whirl itself up to speed and the sort of bright blue, red, and yellow sort of festive opening like a carnival barker just sort of sits there and the thing. And a sort of obtuse, horrible construct of a robot shaped in the fashion of Izzet 'how do you do?' just sort of, 'Welcome boys and girls to the Izzet lab facility! How is everybody doing today? And how may I be of service to you?'
Andrew 36:19
Yeah.
Brian 36:55
And above him, you just see, like, in flashing neon, it just says: 'The Magic Word.'
Sarah 37:01
Oh, okay, so it doesn't look like it's gonna explode?
Brian 37:04
'Oh, I see Mr. Whirleygear and Mr. Reid are not here today. Are you new to the facility?'
Landree 37:13
'No.'
Brian 37:13
'Well, then, please give me the entrance word.' You can kind of look down and you realize that the bottom half of this is just like a mechanical piston. It's just like, the top half of this sort of wooden robot on gears, dead lifeless eyes, an unnecessarily large moustache for what this thing's purpose is, and just the festive sort of, you know, poofy clothing of the Izzet that they like to wear sometimes.
Sarah 37:37
'Zenia, can I just punch it?'
Landree 37:39
'I don't think I'd recommend doing that.'
Sarah 37:42
'Okay.'
Andrew 37:43
'Please.'
Brian 37:43
'Please, what?'
Andrew 37:48
'May we enter the facility?'
Brian 37:50
'Yes. As soon as you-,' and he kind of like just a sarcastic robot finger again, sort of traces. It says: 'The Magic Word.'
Eddie 37:59
'Abracadabra.'
Brian 38:00
'I'm sorry, I don't speak that language. Please respond in Human, Elf, or Vedalken.'
Sarah 38:10
'What if we are new?'
Eddie 38:12
I say 'abracadabra' in Vedalken.
Brian 38:16
Do you speak Vedalken?
Eddie 38:17
I do speak Vedalken!
Ned 38:18
I didn't know you speak Vedalken!
Brian 38:23
Alright, so you say abracadabra in Vedalken. And it just sort of like in a you know, jerky robot fashion just sort of turns and looks at you with this, like, I don't understand this. 'I don't understand that word!'
Andrew 38:35
Can we have, uh-
Brian 38:36
Again, he kind of puts a hand over and just traces it over the top.
Eddie 38:40
I say 'Magic Word' in Vedalken.
Ned 38:43
Is there any kind of punctuation on the sign? Is there anything that would discern a way of discovering the magic word based on the words 'The Magic Word?'
Brian 38:53
Nope, it just says 'The Magic Word' lit up and he just goes. 'This must be spoken.'
Eddie 38:57
I say 'The Magic Word' in Vedalken.
Brian 39:01
He says, 'Well, you can read very well.'
Sarah 39:05
'Zenia, was there anything in the notes or anything that you saw that might suggest what the word would be?'
Landree 39:11
'Orb?'
Brian 39:11
'This must be spoken and only I hold the key.'
Landree 39:17
'Will you please say ""The Magic Word?""'
Brian 39:20
'""The Magic Word!""' And then 'click!' 'Please welcome inside!' as he kind of like shifts to the side and the panel kind of opens in and so you guys kind of open inside and there is just a smithy. Like a stone statue of a smithy and he goes, 'Please, enjoy your lab.' He just '(mechnical sounds)' The walls kind of close behind you. And you guys enter a smithy, like a straight up smithy. And there is a statue of a human smith standing over an anvil. And as the last doors kind of click short together, you hear the robot other one last phrase: 'And only he holds the key.' There's just a smithy and an anvile and a door and a keyhole. And that's all you see at the moment.
Ned 40:07
You first.
Landree 40:08
I'd love to Investigate if anybody wants to assist me.
Eddie 40:12
I will assist you.
Landree 40:20
13
Brian 40:20
13. It's pretty simple. You walk around the room you see some smithing equipment. You see some scrap metal. You don't see any tools, but you do see some scrap metal and a bucket. And as you kind of peel around the side of the statue, you see a piece of white chalk.
Ned 40:38
Does the statue appear to be an automaton of any kind that moves or a hardened statue?
Brian 40:43
It is a hard stone statue.
Ned 40:46
Thank you.
Brian 40:46
You have some pieces of scrap metal, an empty bucket, and a piece of chalk.
Landree 40:50
Uh, do I recognize the scrap metal as, you know.
Brian 40:54
Yeah, it's a simple iron.
Landree 40:56
Ok.
Brian 40:56
Scrap iron. Yes.
Sarah 40:57
I would like to put the iron on the anvil.
Brian 41:00
You place a rod of iron on the anvil.
Sarah 41:03
That's as far as I've gotten good.
Ned 41:07
The chalk we have to write something, we have to draw something.
Andrew 41:10
Can we draw a key on the iron?
Ned 41:13
Oh, that's interesting. I love that idea. Go for it, Lorzatch.
Andrew 41:17
Cool. Lorzatch draws a key on the rod of iron that is on the anvil.
Brian 41:23
The stone statue begins to move as you say, 'Maybe I should stand the fuck back.' And with a couple of stone 'ding ding ding' hammers, the iron kind of breaks away what is in sort of under the oak of the hammer and you see an iron key sitting on top of the anvil.
Ned 41:38
Take the key, try it in the door.
Brian 41:39
The door unlocks.
Ned 41:40
Open- I investigate the door for traps.
Eddie 41:45
I will assist you.
Ned 41:46
Thanks, brother. That is a 15.
Brian 41:52
There are no traps that you see. I also enjoy the fact that Eddie is assisting everyone in their roles as the Azorius as he's just like, 'Look harder. Don't get me stabbed.'
Ned 42:05
I open the door.
Brian 42:06
The door locks. You open the door.
Ned 42:08
I would also like to investigate the floor for traps because that's how you tried to get me last time. That is a 13.
Brian 42:17
There is a trip wire.
Ned 42:19
I would like to, uh, does anyone- I'm actually not, how's my Dex? My Dex is- who is proficiency in Dex, like Dexterity for the sake of dismantling a trap? Because I'm not.
Sarah 42:29
I mean, so yeah, I mean, whatever.
Andrew 42:31
Lorzatch will take the lead on this. If someone wants to assist?
Sarah 42:34
I can assist.
Andrew 42:34
Great.
Eddie 42:36
I will stand back and watch.
Brian 42:37
Careful.
Andrew 42:38
Sleight of hand?
Sarah 42:40
'Little to your left, a little to your left. Don't fuck it up.'
Brian 42:43
Careful!
Andrew 42:43
And with...so the first role was a 12, which makes this a 17 to disarm the trap.
Brian 42:49
A 17. You- how are you going to actually disassemble this trip wire?
Andrew 42:53
Uh, take a look at what mechanism it seems to connect with to, find its anchor point, and remove it.
Brian 43:04
So, as you immediately look through the doorway of what you see here, there is- there's sort of like a, you know, a metal floor, there are tubes and electric pipes everywhere, it almost looks like the inside of a factory rather than some sort of cozy workplace station. So the trip wire actually runs across the floor and then sort of torques up the side of the doorframe, up overhead into the pipe work somewhere. But it is clearly suspending something. Probs meant to drop on them.
Ned 43:37
And you can't see what's up there?
Brian 43:38
You can't see what's up there. So that's what you immediately see. As of right now it doesn't look like anything is going to come in the direction of directly onto you, but you can't exactly see what it is. But you very carefully keep your distance, sever the line, let everything go, and you just hear this loud, like, crash, banging of metal, of pipes as something heavy just sort of 'bing!' '(crashing sounds)' Sort of like falls and breaks and destroys something off in the background somewhere. And you're not even entirely sure that that trap even works anymore for how long it was up there. Something heavy fell and broke something out of your range. But as far as you can tell from now on, it's pretty safe to step inside.
So it seems safe to enter. Right now it's dark. But you can see into the facility that there are some massive pieces of lab equipment set up, pipes kind of everywhere. That sort of living breathing that steel makes when there's a lot of it in the room. But that's as far as you can see from the door.
Ned 44:39
So it's dark?
Brian 44:41
It is dark.
Ned 44:41
Does Darkvision help in any way?
Brian 44:43
Yeah, you can see in and it's just more of that the father in.
Ned 44:47
Ok.
Brian 44:47
There is a, there is a- it seems to be a doorframe directly to your left.
Ned 44:50
Can we look- I would like to investigate for- well, I'm not up front. But I think it'd be great to look for a light source.
Eddie 44:55
I cast Light on my shield.
Brian 44:57
You cast Light on your shield.
Landree 44:58
I cast Frank.
Brian 44:59
You cast Frank.
Ned 45:01
We created a marching order that we didn't approve with you, Zenia.
Landree 45:04
Oh, I'm perfectly comfortable with that as long as I'm not blinding anybody.
Ned 45:09
I mean, that's going to happen no matter what.
Landree 45:11
Okay, yeah, that's great.
Brian 45:12
Do we dare enter?
Ned 45:14
No, not anymore.
Brian 45:18
Welcome to the laboratory of your doom.
Ned 45:22
So-
Brian 45:23
'(evil laughter)'
Ned 45:24
I mean, men up front.
Brian 45:26
This is great. This is a secret Izzet lab and you're all like, 'I don't want to be first.'
Landree 45:33
I mean, should I go first?
Ned 45:36
I mean, like, how easily do you die?
Landree 45:41
Incredibly easily.
Brian 45:43
Are we ready to enter?
Ned 45:45
No, no, I'm sorry.
Brian 45:47
At some point the adventure needs to continue. I don't think the instant death trap is on the first space.
Ned 45:55
I do!
Andrew 45:56
Lorzatch will investigate this door on the immediate left.
Brian 46:00
There is a simple latch from the outside. It's just sort of like a double door with a lever that, a latch that sort of swings over the top. Everything is made out of metal here.
Eddie 46:10
Can we just, for the sake of time-
Brian 46:12
Yeah.
Eddie 46:12
Assume every time anyone is investigating anything, I'm assisting them. So they will get an assist.
Brian 46:19
Can you roleplay for me exactly what this sort of consistent authority is going to be? Like it's it-
Eddie 46:24
'I will stand next to whoever is investigating anything and assist them in their endeavor.'
Brian 46:30
'Do this. Do it.' I'm going to look at this door. 'Yeah, do that.'
Eddie 46:34
'Do that better.'
Brian 46:35
'Do that.' Azorius.
Sarah 46:38
'You know, the Azorius do it this way.'
Andrew 46:41
So Lorzatch rolls a 20 to Investigate this door.
Brian 46:44
You can just open it.
Andrew 46:45
And he does.
Brian 46:46
There's nothing, there's nothing with traps.
Andrew 46:47
And he does.
Brian 46:47
So you open the door. Inside that small little side room there are stacks of cages and straw and little dishes and stuff that suggest it was a small room to hold animals, creatures, rodent. Um, given the nature of where you are, probably research specimens.
Andrew 47:08
Test subjects.
Brian 47:08
Test subjects. There are a few half skeletons kicking around in there.
Ned 47:14
Which half?
Brian 47:15
Various halves. There are, no longer as corpses, but there are some sort of rotted away skeleton parts, but only for the skeletons that are in there. They are only half of their skeletons.
Andrew 47:28
Oh.
Landree 47:28
Ok.
Sarah 47:29
So...
Ned 47:31
I would push on to at least be near Lorzatch to look at this contraption that seems to be right at the beginning.
Brian 47:38
So there is, uh, you can see something big.
Ned 47:41
And we don't have it from Lennox's shield? Like some-
Brian 47:44
W-you, it's, it's far too big right now and complicated. Like you'd need to kind of take in the full size of it to understand what it is. But there is a, there is a, like a steam controlled electrical panel right in front of you.
Ned 47:58
And does that, uh, I guess this is investigation question. But I would like to know if that panel seems to do something to the thing. Or what I'd really like to know is if there's a light source that happens in the thing,
Brian 48:07
You're welcome to-
Ned 48:08
'Zenia, I'm looking for a light source.'
Brian 48:09
You're allowed to tinker with whatever you want as a Simic Biomancer.
Ned 48:13
'Zenia, I'm looking for a light source for the room.'
Landree 48:16
'Hm. That's fair.' So she also looks at this panel-
Brian 48:21
This doesn't look like a frog organ.
Ned 48:23
Yeah, no, I deal with frogs.
Brian 48:25
Yeah.
Landree 48:26
Zenia goes up to the panel and Investigates.
Brian 48:29
With advantage, please.
Landree 48:31
22.
Brian 48:32
It seems to be sort of a general power coupling. It's going to feed power to whatever this is in the middle. But you kind of discern some of the writings in the coding and there is sort of a big lever on the side that is going to instigate power into whatever is in this first floor area. Simple flip of the switch. Nothing looks trapped, nothing looks, you know, hazardous in any way, it just simply is the first console you will encounter on your way in. The last one you'll see your way out. So it's probably the main switch.
Landree 49:01
Okay, and do I see a light switch anwhere?
Brian 49:04
If you if you just sort of pump this big lever on the side, it looks like it's going to power up.
Landree 49:10
Okay, um, without any hesitation, she just pushes up the lever.
Brian 49:14
Yeah, you just hear a 'tick, tick, tick, tick', and then a fuse running across the- no. So you sees Zenia give a little bit of effort as she '(groaning sound)' this lever and that immediately is followed by some loud machinery sounds and some whirling of power sounds as this '(sounds of machinery charging up)' generative power starts kicking up.
Andrew 49:42
The audience is now listening.
Brian 49:46
What you see in the center is a massive metal cylinder. And in fact, that contraption that you see is actually two stories tall. There are pipes and tubes leading to several large glass orbs surrounding this sort of massive tank in the middle. Something like a like a propane tank that's about the size of a longhouse. Those orbs light up and immediately enlight the entire lab, and you just see the walls themselves aren't even really walls. They're just sort of mass contortions of tubing, and power lines, and installation, as if the entire facility itself is you sort of like inside a massive machine. And as you look up, you can see that this thing stretches beyond the ceiling, and there is a second floor directly above you, that sort of partition by a catwalk that leads around near the top of this sort of massive power structure in the middle, so that it can be observed and calibrated and manipulated from the second floor as well. And you can also see sort of farther back into the facility that there is ways to get up to the second floor. And that it is about twice as deep as perhaps you once thought it was
Landree 50:59
Zenia is utterly delighted there. She has no fear right now, even though she probably should, she's just so excited.
Brian 51:06
There is so much electricity and power running through whatever this thing is right in front of you that you're immediately thinking of like all the crazy experiments you could do with access to this type of facility. It is top of the line. When you hear stories about what you get access to if you finally get your research money, like you couldn't even imagine access to this kind of place. It is magnanimous.
Ned 51:27
So, I would begin investigating the first floor looking for anything that might look like clues to the whole area, or I'm looking for notes, or I'd be looking for something that would be able to tell us where the orb might be within the place.
Brian 51:41
So, you see two doors about halfway through. I'm sorry, you see one door on the far wall. It's a small door. And then on the side that you're on, if you travel far enough, yes. So we'll say that Parax is kind of wandered around to the right. You see a small door on the side there and we'll start there as to whether or not you want to investigate that door.
Ned 51:59
Yeah, of course, I would love to investigate that door.
Eddie 52:01
'Do that better.'
Ned 52:04
'Thank you.' That is a 14.
Brian 52:07
A 14. The door does not appear to be trapped.
Ned 52:10
And the floor?
Brian 52:11
There are no traps.
Ned 52:12
Great.
Brian 52:14
It's not even locked.
Ned 52:14
Well then, on inI go.
Brian 52:16
You find a simple storage closet holding excess amounts of beakers, bottles, vials full of stuff you don't know, probably powders in some tin containers, a broom, light bulbs.
Ned 52:28
So what would appear to potentially be a storage closet.
Brian 52:31
A storage closet.
Ned 52:32
Yeah. But I would look around to see if there were any, like, because I probably don't know what a storage closet looks like in an Izzetfacility, I'd probably look around to see if there are any notes or like a, like things in the room that would clue me in. Not knowing I'm looking in vain.
Brian 52:44
No, in that particular area, there's not.
Ned 52:46
Yep.
Brian 52:48
But if you look down onto your left, there is at least one staircase you can see that bends. It's a, to a broken staircase. So it goes up halfway and then comes back up the other way to get up to the top.
Ned 52:59
So I would call out, 'Guys, I found stairs going up.'
Andrew 53:02
Lorzatch will continue down the left side of the hallway and inspect this other antechamber to the left.
Brian 53:11
So as you look to your left, Yes, go ahead Fikkara.
Sarah 53:14
I'll just say, 'I'll-I'll follow him,' cause I'm not going to get left alone.
Brian 53:17
Great.
Andrew 53:17
Please do.
Brian 53:18
So as you guys sort of walk down the left hand side of the lab, you see a little recessed antechamber as you look inside. There is a massive tank that stretches all the way up to the second floor. It is very, very large. It seems to be filled with sort of a, not really glowing, but somewhere in between not glowing and glowing, you know, just like a barely pulsating, yellowish goo. There is something inside of it.
Andrew 53:46
It's a transparent tank?
Brian 53:47
The tank itself is transparent. The stuff inside of it is so cloudy and murky that you can see that there is something in there being suspended. It's difficult to kind of discern like what it is, you know, is it gestating? I don't know. Is it cultivating? I don't know, is it just sort of a holding cell for something fragile and why it's suspended in gel? I don't know. Like, there are many different things that you could imagine it could be
Sarah 54:12
I'd like to knock on the glass and see if anything responds. You're welcome.
Brian 54:16
Please make a stupidity check.
Sarah 54:18
Gotcha.
Brian 54:20
Nothing happens it doesn't stir, it doesn't gel, it just- something is in there and has been preserved since nobody was in here.
Sarah 54:26
Okay.
Landree 54:27
Um, I am continuing if this is fruitful at all, and Zenia would know not me. But I think I'd like to just continue working my way around that specific mechanism itself.
Brian 54:37
Mmhmm.
Landree 54:38
And I think I'll go, I'll go this a-ways cause that looks like there's something going on there.
Brian 54:43
So most of the control panels that you can see manage the flow of solution in between those massive glass orbs. And the more that you're looking at it, the more that you can kind of see that this is very similar to whatever contraption was in the center of the top room of the tower in Whirlygear's facility, that this was a much larger version of that and perhaps given the fact that he worked here before his tower he may have been trying to replicate that on a micro level.
Landree 55:12
And that was the contraption in his tower that helped the-
Brian 55:16
Yeah, he opened up one of those containers and used it to kind of demonstrate the orb and you can see with your own scientific mind that you can see that the solution that might be inside some of these orbs is very similar, if not the exact copy of the stuff that he had in there.
Andrew 55:31
Is this a window into the primary tank?
Brian 55:34
It is an access port and so it is not, it is not glass. You probably immediately get the idea that whatever it is in here probably doesn't want to have any structural weakness on this massive tank considering that the tank itself is like the size of one of those train cars that you guys encountered earlier. But that is clearly some sort of riveted access port so that if it was ever drained or anyone ever needed to get inside for any reason they would have access to the inside. Otherwise it would just be a solid metal tube.
Landree 56:03
And this particular liquid that we're looking at, I mean is it simply, is it simply water? Or that we also saw Whirleygear's or is it a different liquid?
Brian 56:11
It is clear. I mean there is, there is no color to it, but it is a little bit murky and just a little bit to it in the way- it has a bit of a sheen to it. Like in the way that if you were to swirl around water in a glass jar or you were to swirl around, like, vodka in a glass jar. Because one of them is an alcohol, it has just a little bit of a cling to it, a little bit of a sheen. So it's not pure water. It is some sort of synthetic solution. What exactly it is, there's no way of knowing without actually consulting who it is but it's probably synthetic to begin with and based on your experience in Whirleygear's tower, it is possibly designed specifically for containing and examining the orb since that was studied here.
Ned 56:55
I would continue on forward and I would be going up the stairs to see what I see.
Brian 56:58
Great. As you approach the stairs, you hear like a bubbling on the move.
Ned 57:05
A bubbling on the move?
Brian 57:06
Yeah, so sort of right at the- back a little bit more. Right as he approaches that sort of hexagon area? You're going to hear what sounds like a large bubbling, like a pot of bubbling water?
Ned 57:15
Okay.
Brian 57:16
Like a very large pot of boiling water. Like a bathtub of bubbling water but it's on the move.
Ned 57:21
Okay.
Brian 57:22
It is moving towards you.
Ned 57:23
Can it- it's coming at me from directly in front of me? And can I see it?
Brian 57:26
From the stairs and yes, you can.
Descending the stairs from the back of the laboratory are two boiling and bubbling elemental souls that are dripping magma from underneath this, like, strange aqua exterior. Zenia, you would know that these are Blistercoil Weirds, okay? And the these Weirds are the byproduct of laboratory accidents that have formed into these programmable elementals. These two appear to be the fusion between magma and water. And for any of you who speak Draconic, you can hear that they've come for a fight.
On the next Encounter Party! Though the secret base of Malfus Reid has been abandoned, security seems very much online. Can our players navigate the dangers of a master laboratory? Is Whirleygear telling the truth? And can they find the second orb? Find out next week on Encounter Party!

Brian 0:28
Last time on Encounter Party! Deep underground, our players burrow through the Undercity on the hunt for clues left by Malfus Reid. Despite the presence of Lorzatch, tragedy strikes as they are attacked by the Golgari, mistaking the party for a Simic assault. With Golgari blood on their hands, will our players be able to pass safely through the Undercity? Find out this week on Encounter Party!
So our party, trapped in the Undercity. The players awake after a short rest to find themselves surrounded by the dead Kraul warriors they have just killed. The air is stifling, wet and cold. The light from Lennox's is shield and the light from Frank, a spiritual apparition of light, is all that comforts the players in the dark tunnel that leads to seemingly nowhere. What come next is up to them.
Ned 1:37
'So we have to continue along the path. But Golgari, can you discern where our next steps might be to?""
Andrew 1:43
Lorzatch knelt quietly by the corpse of the Kraul Death Priestess and has been in silent prayer for the last several hours and it is the first time the party has seen him in any way regard the dead other something that can be used.
Brian 1:59
Please take a point of inspiration.
Eddie 2:00
Lennox rifles through the dead corpse of the dead priestess.
Andrew 2:06
And Lorzatch won't stop and because the dead can be used.
Brian 2:11
The- I mean what you will find on them is very simple. They don't really manage any possessions. They have Kraul bows that look like they take more than two arms to use. They have Kraul spears that look like they take more than two arms to use. The Death Priestess has a very large sort of unwieldy staff but it's most likely just a magical focus and is pretty useless on your own. Any sort of bark or makeshift armor that they're wearing is useless to humanoids. Everything is catered to them they are a very minimalist race when it comes to at least war.
Sarah 2:47
I just like to go up to Laura's and be like, 'Lorzatch, It's never good day when we have to find our own kind. I'm sorry for your loss.'
Andrew 2:55
'They aren't lost.'
Sarah 2:56
'Well, uh, uh, uh, alright.'
Eddie 3:01
'Onwards.'
Andrew 3:01
'Okay.'
Brian 3:04
Ah, well, the time for sorrow was lost and the Azorius Arrester among you has decided that bravery is needed and Justice waits for no man. As Lennox summons you all up from the ground and marches you farther in to the dark, would you please establish a marching order?
Andrew 3:24
Lorzatch will again be at the front as he is most familiar with the terrain and the people that they are likely to encounter.
Eddie 3:30
I will be directly behind Lorzatch.
Ned 3:32
I will be as far back as possible because they do not like the Simic. Probably not in the back. If so, I gotta fine armor class. So actually, I can be in the back if you want to be a little closer ip.
Sarah 3:40
I mean, it's up to you. I have no problem.
Ned 3:43
Great.
Sarah 3:43
Back.
Ned 3:44
This seems great.
Brian 3:44
Okay.
Sarah 3:45
I'm okay with this.
Landree 3:46
I'm gonna actually be behind Parax, so I don't hurt his eyeballs too much with Frank.
Ned 3:51
Thanks.
Landree 3:52
Mhm.
Brian 3:52
So Frank is marching-
Ned 3:54
I'm now between the two light sources.
Brian 3:59
So Frank is marching side by side with you, Zenia?
Landree 4:01
Yeah.
Sarah 4:03
Oh.
Brian 4:04
I love how it's a humanoid male. Who's just like, 'This is Frank. we're together.'
Sarah 4:11
'My parents were a little weirded out when we first met Frank, but you know ,we're in love.'
Brian 4:14
'When I first made my boyfriend, my parents were a little alarmed, but they think I've done good work'.
So you guys continue to march through this unsettlingly quiet area, this tunnel that curves deeper and deeper, twists in undiscernable directions. Does anyone have the ability to determine direction or time of day and random areas?
Ned 4:35
Fortunately, the feat I might take will, but we're not at fourth level yet.
Brian 4:38
We're not at fourth level.
Sarah 4:41
I'm a Minotaur.
Ned 4:42
Keen Mind feels useful, but I don't have it yet.
Brian 4:46
Lorzatch why don't you give me a Survival check as this is home turf.
Andrew 4:52
Nine.
Brian 4:54
Regardless of where you think you might be, the best thing in everyone's mind is perhaps to just keep following this tunnel. About another 20 to 30 minutes of travel, which maybe isn't very far distance wise, as you feel your way through, you start to hear the crunch under your feet before you see even more dead Kraul warriors farther into the tongue. Doubling in number from what you actually fought towards the front.
Ned 5:22
Can we do a quick investigation to see the cause?
Brian 5:25
Please do an Investigation check.
Ned 5:31
Nat 20 plus three.
Brian 5:33
Okay.
Sarah 5:34
I rolled a six.
Brian 5:36
Andrew, what did you roll?
Andrew 5:37
It was a 13.
Brian 5:38
A 13.
One of the things that you immediately find besides just the Kraul warriors are dead, Merfolk and other Simic hybrid. There has clearly been clashes in this tunnel between the two guilds. Neither have seemed to bother removing the dead, possibly out of danger. Parax with your roll, you actually do hear something stirring within sort of one cluster of bodies, as it seems like one of the Kraul warriors may actually still be alive.
Ned 6:07
So I would alert the Golgari to that.
Brian 6:10
Okay,
Ned 6:10
Any, any Merfolk kicking around? That's who I would go talk to if they existed, but if they all dead, then I would probably try and- we don't care much for life or death in that regard. It's kind of is what it is. But I think I would look to see if there was anyone I recognized or if there was anyone who looks to be of a- would have been carrying something we could use.
Brian 6:30
Everyone is just carrying basic martial weapons.
Ned 6:32
Great.
Brian 6:33
You are of the medical facility? Whatever these soldiers would be are not inherently part of the Zonot. They would have been continually imported to help stem this tide.
Ned 6:42
Understood.
Brian 6:43
So this is a purely military unit not- there's probably some War Mages among them and stuff like that. But as far as personal recognition, no, you wouldn't see anyone.
Ned 6:53
Great, thank you.
Andrew 6:54
The movement is a wounded Kraul?
Brian 6:57
Yes.
Andrew 6:58
Lorzatch will approach and speak to it in Kraul.
Brian 7:01
It hears you. And you can see that part of its wound is it has sort of a smashed cranium, and that it is blind, and its wings are crushed, and three of its upper arms are also broken, two of which have been torn off. And it's holding its spear with just one of its remaining arms, knowing that that alone is not strength enough to use it. And it's not that the Kraul is necessarily been hiding, but it has positioned itself in the best position to be able to consume and eat the things around it in order to sustain itself. And it is doing the best it can to keep whatever pride it might be able to find in the wake of being discovered in such a state but it is very happy- you know, it, there is that initial like defensive shutter until it realizes that there is a Devkarin elf speaking to it. As it can tell, even though you are speaking Kraul, that you come from an Elvish mouth. Please roll a Medicine check.
Andrew 8:00
19.
Brian 8:00
This Kraul has been down here for, I would say, in excess of five days and probably either not discovered or left here by the patrol that attacked you guys. It's difficult to tell with Kraul culture as to whether or not one is preserved. He may have been beyond saving. But there is this sort of reawakened unity between you that perhaps speaking to a Devkarin is a little bit better than disappointing its own swarm, and you feel this sort of wheeze like '(wheezing breath)'
'Hello, brother. I am still here. I can still fight.'
Eddie 8:45
'Let's put this thing out of its misery.'
Andrew 8:47
To which Lorzatch will spin with blade drawn and say, 'Absolutely not.' '
Eddie 8:53
'Look at it.'
Andrew 8:54
And will-
Brian 8:54
It's important to know that these are Kraul and they're speaking and insect language made of clicks and wing, wings rubbing together. So it's a very chirpy, very clicky language. So as far as you know, having never encountered Kraul in the first place, it may be a surprise to you that these things are even sentient and you definitely can understand the communication because you hear Lorzatch making a bunch of weird sort of trills and, and whistles and-
Andrew 9:18
Buzzing noises.
Brian 9:19
Buzzing noises, yeah.
Andrew 9:21
And Lorzatch will ask, 'Where can we take you that you might be safe?'
Brian 9:25
'I do not know if I can move. I am pinned down.' And you kind of peel a thing away and realize that there is a Simic spear sort of pinning him down into the dirt.
Andrew 9:44
Do we need another Medicine roll to-
Brian 9:47
It is of the situation that with the right medical care he could be preserved, but it is one of those horrible situations that if you remove the spear he dies. Unless you have the correct medical professions to do something that you know Kraul themselves won't be able to do which might be the reason they left him in the first place.
Andrew 10:08
Lorzatch is doing what he can to treat the immediate wounds and will cast Cure Wounds-
Brian 10:14
Great.
Andrew 10:15
-to heal the Kraul.
Brian 10:16
Which is how much?
Andrew 10:18
One d8 plus 3.
Brian 10:19
One d8 plus 3.. So the Kraul warrior regained seven hit points and it kind of feels an ability to kind of stand up and it feels like, heck, it might actually be able to make its way out of here but still acknowledging the fact that '(wheezing noise)'
'I cannot see, brother. I am blinded by the fish folk.'
Andrew 10:40
In putting his arm around the Kraul, uh-
Brian 10:44
'I heard fighting by others who survived?'
Andrew 10:52
'Not of the swarm. We are five've come upon you. We will take you where you a be safe.'
Brian 11:06
'We are-we are thankful. We have been fighting for many days. Orders that the Kraul must fight, as they always order us to fight.'
Andrew 11:27
'Who orders?'
Brian 11:31
'You orders. Always the Elfkind. Never our choice.'
Andrew 11:38
Lorzatch collects his thoughts momentarily, guiding the crawl around mounds of dead bodies and scattered weapons. 'Dimir endanger the surface. Their predations move underground.'
Brian 11:56
'The leaders you must. I am but a member of the swarm. I know nothing, but I can direct you.'
Andrew 12:08
And Lorzatch will guide the wounded Kraul where the Kraul directs them to go.
Brian 12:12
Okay.
Andrew 12:13
And will relay what he can in Common to the rest of the party.
Brian 12:17
So with an indiscernible amount of time, as from where you orient and where you are not, your teammate Lorzatch has kind of turned to you after speaking to this insectile creature and seems to suggest some sort of passivity and offers a plan for you guys to continue without the danger of being attacked again.
And as of right now your guide, although blind, has no way of knowing that there are Simic among you. So with your acceptance, the travel becomes slow. Again. As you crawl through the dark and even though you have light to see those around you the path is long and eventually you start hearing buzzing and trilling and the collective sound as a glowing comes from around on the corner turn the tunnel. And everything seems to get very lucid green is the flickering and buzzing of a great deal of swarm of Kraul come into focus as you open into sort of a larger chamber where there are many Golgari into what is a war camp.
At the center of this troop, in the middle between all of the barricades and the weapon racks and the spindles of web here in the sacs there there is a large looking troll with a tall, spiked Mohawk of hair. Orange straps of fungus growing over his shoulders in all places. Thick bark and reptilian scales cover him and this sort of unsettling permanent grin on his face.
Ned 13:48
You know, it'd be a great time if I decided to learn Adapt self.
Andrew 13:55
Is this someone Lorzatch recognizes?
Brian 13:58
Not likely. Is Lorzatch a member of the military vanguard?
Andrew 14:02
No.
Brian 14:03
Right. So this is clearly a troll with confidence. That is somebody who is like, 'hey, go fight that thing.' But this troll looks like he's kind of in command of what's going on. And this, this injured Kraul tells you to seek the troll. The troll is the one kind of in charge here.
Andrew 14:21
And there's a infirmary setup or some equivalent?
Brian 14:25
Well, yes. So you're talking about Kraul magic and Death Priests. So what the hope here is that- roll an Intelligence check to see whether or not you wish to continue with what you may know is about to happen.
Andrew 14:38
19.
Brian 14:39
So what you know is going to happen, if you decide to turn him in the way that is going to happen, is the minute he is taken into the quote unquote, infirmary, he is going to be killed and resurrected.
Andrew 14:50
Yeah.
Brian 14:51
Which if that's natural for you, then that's what you do.
Andrew 14:54
It is the best way forward.
Brian 14:56
Right. So as you guys are sort of walking your way through here, you've been given kind of safe passage. The people at the command posts in the center of this clearing who are kind of hanging out with this troll have kind of acknowledged that you're coming through. All of these insect warriors kind of turn to you guys, and they're flittering and buzzing all around you, they're not really sure what to make of you.
You can understand what they're saying. So it's a lot of angry trills and clicking and a lot of sort of spear jabbing and fingers pointing at Parax in the back.
Andrew 15:24
Lorzatch can.
Brian 15:25
Well, maybe we shouldn't repeat those slurs on this podcast because it's pretty offensive. But as you watch Lorzatch as sort of hand this Kraul off to some of the infirmary, you can see in very rapid procession that he sort of just gets led over to this area of the clearing, laid down on a table, and then several Kraul just ram ppears through him, and kill him immediately. And anyone with a magical sense can then see another one of those Death Priests who starts weaving magic above them. And you Lennox, being a cleric ,immediately noticed that there's a significant portion of these creatures around you that are just undead. You reah- you, you reach the middle of the clearing, the sort of more authoritative Kraul sort of step back and that troll sort of welcomes you forward with that sort of grin that you notice isn't necessarily a permanent smile but partially unavoidable as half of his face is sort of scarred back from a battlefield.
And he kind of, he kind of snarls at you and he just goes. 'Well, hello...and you are a far way from home, Elfkind.'
Andrew 16:34
'And for entirely too long. I quite agree.'
Brian 16:40
'This is quite a catch you have brought. Spoils of war?'
Andrew 16:44
'Something of that nature. I've come with an offering from the Master Biomancer.'
Brian 16:49
'I bet the large one is delicious.'
Sarah 16:57
Is he speaking Common?
Brian 16:58
He's probably speaking Elven.
Sarah 17:00
Okay.
Brian 17:00
Yes
Ned 17:01
So I can hear this.
Brian 17:02
Yes.
Ned 17:03
I'm not gonna say shit.
Brian 17:04
Nope.
Ned 17:05
But I can hear it.
Brian 17:05
Because he's talking about the cow.
Ned 17:07
Yeah, no, I understand that.
Andrew 17:10
'And then with rather a lot of gristle on it. And either way not for eating at this time.'
Brian 17:16
'Pity. Snacks when they come with their own toothpicks.'
Andrew 17:20
'The Dimir above have decimated the Simic.'
'I expect the attacks to cease and I believe the time has come to sue for peace and we will continue to build through.'
Brian 17:25
'Good.'
'Peace. '(laughs)' Peace is not an option in this particular fight..'
Andrew 17:39
'What don't I know?'
Brian 17:41
'You have been gone for too long. We have allied ourselves with the mages from upstairs. The Izzet lightning power? We assault the Zonnot for their means and we get access to build our line through the Undercity.'
Andrew 18:03
'Do these not compete? If the Izzet complete their rail line can we not complete ours?'
Brian 18:07
'There is more I do not know but I know that primary concern is the Simic are in control of the power station. The Izzet want control of that power station and they will offer us free rein to build our line underneath while quartering out the Boros as well. For whatever reason the powers that be seemed to favor the inorganic magic.'
Andrew 18:40
'For now at least.'
Brian 18:43
'All I know is I have been given reserve to fight. '(laughs and snorts)'
Andrew 18:54
And Lorzatch will ask where these Izzet representatives are in the Undercity.
Brian 18:59
'This is above my station. Orders came from Central Hold then to the 10th Precinct. I've traveled a long way for this position and I am enjoying myself.'
Ned 19:15
So in Vedalken, I'm going to pass to Zenia-
Brian 19:19
Okay.
Ned 19:20
That appears that the is it have declared war on Zonnot Four and she has much to answer for it to me later.
Andrew 19:25
To be clear, these orders came from Korosda?
Brian 19:27
Yes.
Andrew 19:28
This is impressive. Lorzatch looks impressed.
Brian 19:31
'For now, the Golgari have agreed to do the bidding of the Izzet for future investments.'
Andrew 19:42
'And have they shared these investments with you?'
Brian 19:45
'Again, I am not Devkarin, nor am I Gorgon. We are told what to do and yet I've been given leave to fight and to eat. Do you join us?'
Andrew 20:04
So to consider our options at this point: we know that there are Izzet representatives somewhere in the Undercity. We don't know how to get to them. And the only person who was in-
Brian 20:14
It's not necessarily Izzet representatives in the Undercity. It's just coming from high command that for some reason, the yoke already have temporarily allied themselves with the Izzet.
Ned 20:24
And they're assaulting Zonnot Four on behalf of the Izzet?
Brian 20:27
Yes.
Andrew 20:28
Um.
Brian 20:28
'The guild's of Ravnica.'
Ned 20:31
So what is it you're trying to figure out? Andrew?
Andrew 20:35
How to get more details. The troll doesn't know very much. And the high command would be all the way in the 10th District and Korozda, which is a far way to go and-
Brian 20:44
It's a far way- it is a far way to go. And do not forget that your immediate mission-
Ned 20:50
Involves Zenia.
Andrew 20:51
Involves, yeah. Good point. 'For the time being, we have to trace energy spikes leaving the power station that could endanger the mission.'
Brian 21:02
'What do you need of me?'
Andrew 21:04
'Safe passage through the camp and your word that no others will eat those in my company for now.'
Brian 21:10
'Does this involve the Izzet alliance?'
Andrew 21:14
'And potentially the Dimir that seek to undermine it.'
Brian 21:17
'So you must get to the surface.'
Andrew 21:20
'In time. Yes..'
Brian 21:22
'That is faster than you think. I will give you a guide. One question: might I eat one of them?'
Andrew 21:32
'If one displeases me, I'll make sure you eat your fill.'
Brian 21:38
'Excellent. This way.' And you are given some more Kraul warriors to- you guys are given a Kraul escort to lead you out of here as it is clear you guys need to make it to the surface.
AD BREAK
Brian 22:34
I need everyone to give me a Survival check to check for exhaustion.
Ned 22:39
Does a rest clear my previous level of exhaustion?
Brian 22:41
Only at a long rest.
Ned 22:43
Copy
Andrew 22:43
11.
Brian 22:44
11.
Eddie 22:45
20.
Brian 22:46
20. We're looking for above a 10.
Landree 22:48
Oh, 13.
Ned 22:48
We're good here.
Sarah 22:49
Three.
Brian 22:50
Three, you have a level of an exhaustion. So you have disadvantage on skill checks.
Sarah 22:55
Gotcha.
Brian 22:55
And ability checks.
After, again, an indiscernible amount of time because none of you have any abilities, you are eventually led back up through the surface into a chunk of ground that is some sort of abandoned demolition site. Some pockets of earth hastily scurried away that have been put in protections so nobody stumbled upon a hive hole. Because you don't know how long you have been down there, and because you don't know how long it has been since you have traversed in the first place, or of what distance you've traveled, I need some sort of communal work between the five of you to figure out where you are, what time it is to give Zenia what she needs to sort of re-associate where you guys are supposed to end up.
Andrew 23:40
If someone wants to assist me with Survival.
Ned 23:43
If someone wants to assist me with Nature.
Eddie 23:45
I will assist.
Brian 23:45
You can just assist. You don't have to have proficiency in ability you just have to-
Ned 23:49
I'm a very high Nature count. So if someone wants to assist my way through that.
Andrew 23:53
So, Lorzatch rolled a 23.
Brian 23:55
Great. Making a Nature roll?
Ned 23:58
Assist gives me a what?
Andrew 23:59
Just advantage.
Brian 23:59
But you had a disadvantage from exhaustion.
Ned 24:01
Right So it gave me nothing.
Brian 24:02
So it washes out.
Ned 24:04
It washes out the disadvantage and I got an 11.
Brian 24:05
An 11. Okay, an 11 is not so good. But the Survive ability check, I think puts you in a good enough spot and maybe just simply asking the Kraul warrior that helped you out where this puts out, is you are about 20 kilometers north of the compound. Definitely within the area that you, Zenia, were hoping to be in because the largest cluster of probability was in that area. So with a little bit of assertion asking around a couple of people you kind of get a sense of where you are. Could you please give me an Intelligence check with advantage.
Landree 24:40
Fantastic. That is a 20.
Brian 24:44
Okay.
Landree 24:44
Unnatural.
Brian 24:45
Great.
Landree 24:46
'Okay, this is going to be super fun. So, we're going to go to this location-ish, and something is probably going to happen. And we'll have about 10 seconds! During which I don't know when it will happen and we just have to be ready.'
Andrew 25:01
'To do what?'
'I'm not sure.'
Ned 25:04
'And will it affect us or are we doing things?'
Landree 25:08
'I don't know. I do know it probably deals with electricity, so.'
Ned 25:13
'That seems likely from a power plant.'
Landree 25:15
'That's all I've got.'
Brian 25:16
So somewhere in the near future, in this location she has taken you to, which is this seemingly innocuous cluster of apartment buildings, at some point within the next five minutes to five hours there is going to be a 10 second interval of something happening with which you guys are allowed to react to. Let's say that you are on a city block. How would you like to position yourselves?
Ned 25:41
Like a like an all compass points open city block?
Brian 25:44
Yeah, we'll say we're at the intersection compass points of a city block.
Ned 25:48
Well.
Andrew 25:49
My recommend- one and or near each corner of the city block and one near the center of the city block.
Ned 25:57
Can anyone be in the air?
Sarah 25:59
'Zenia. Do we want catch this lightning?'
Landree 26:02
'I don't know.'
Sarah 26:03
'Oh, so-'
Andrew 26:05
I think that spreading out and gives us a chance to cover the entire ground and we're all within a pretty close proximity to each other if something happens and we need some teamwork.
Ned 26:18
Sure. I'll buy it.
Brian 26:21
This is great.
Sarah 26:22
'You know, I've had more- I've had directions that are vaguer from the Boros so okay.'
Landree 26:26
'I think it's important to also request no matter how long we are here that no one blink.'
Ned 26:31
'No one blinks for ten seconds?'
Eddie 26:33
'Excuse me.'
Ned 26:35
'Might I suggest, Zenia, you take the center as the one who is most likely to understand anything about this.'
Landree 26:40
'Okay.'
Brian 26:42
This is fantastic. Okay, so you guys line up one on each corner. Zenia just stationary right in the middle.
Ned 26:49
Not blinking.
Brian 26:49
Not blinking.
Landree 26:50
Not blinking.
Brian 26:50
No one is blinking. You guys wait. I need a Wisdom saving throw from everyone, please.
Sarah 26:58
Aw, fuck.
Landree 27:05
Nat 20!
Brian 27:05
This is gr-this is great. Zenia, you're ready. You, you are not, you are not dismarred, exhausted. You are just fully alert in the middle of this intersection just wide-eyed, ready for whatever is about to happen. Who got below a 10?
Ned 27:22
I have a real good wisdom too.
Brian 27:24
Did you roll?
Sarah 27:25
I rolled a 13!
Brian 27:27
You, are you exhausted?
Sarah 27:29
Oh.
Ned 27:29
Oh yeah. It could get worse. It did get worse.
Brian 27:35
Was it below a 10?
Ned 27:36
It got much worse.
Sarah 27:37
Four.
Brian 27:38
Okay, so you rolled a four.
Ned 27:39
I went from a three to a natural one so I have a five.
Brian 27:42
Great. So, well you have to take the lower.
Ned 27:44
Yeah, because I have a plus four-
Brian 27:45
So five and a four.
Ned 27:46
Yeah.
Brian 27:47
Okay. I will make-
Sarah 27:48
I don't like this game anymore.
Brian 27:49
I will make a note, I will make a note of this. But this- you guys are already exhausted so the idea of strenuating your eyes and focus seeing on everything and nothing as you look for that leaf blowing across, 'does that what I have to, Oh, what was that sound. was that a bird? Who is that guy? What is going on?' Every little ounce of sensory input. You are not sure if what, or where, or why, what until suddenly the entire area in front of you, you- something solid just sort of flickers in your entire view and then suddenly a tower just displaces into the spot. Just '(sound)' There is a tower in the intersection.
Ned 28:38
Did Zenia just get-
Brian 28:39
Zenia is gone.
Landree 28:40
'(deep laugh)'
Brian 28:42
So where she was is now a tower.
Eddie 28:46
Do I see an entrance?
Ned 28:47
Yeah.
Eddie 28:48
You each see a possible entrance in front of you. More importantly, there was a railing and a cat walk around. You all must make your choice of Athletics, Acrobatic.
Sarah 29:03
No.
Ned 29:05
Okay.
Sarah 29:09
Dear dice-
Eddie 29:11
Nat 20.
Sarah 29:12
Please don't fuck me. Ooh yeah! That's a fucking, like, 22.
Brian 29:18
With disadvantage?
Sarah 29:19
Yeah!
Brian 29:20
Great.
Sarah 29:20
I rolled a 19 and a 16. And I'm a ninja mount cow.
Ned 29:23
Well, the second one was good. I have a nine.
Brian 29:26
You have a nine.
Andrew 29:26
I rolled a 15.
Brian 29:28
A 15.
Andrew 29:29
On acrobatics.
Brian 29:30
Ned, you manage to kind of flop over.
Ned 29:32
I am a fish. After all.
Brian 29:34
What you're doing. You take seven points of damage.
Ned 29:38
Fucking shit.
Andrew 29:39
Fish man.
Brian 29:40
And-
Ned 29:41
Riding in the fish van.
Brian 29:42
Everybody gets a chance to sort of enter these, like, little areas. Now what you're, you've, so you've entered these little alcoves. You haven't actually accessed your respective doors, but what you suddenly see as you kind of turn around and look behind you is the world outside you is like changing location with half a snap of a finger just- '(electric sounds)' You're here. You're there. Then you're somewhere else, then you're back to where something that looks like, like if you were to step off of wherever you are, who knows where you would end up because this tower is literally shifting physical locations on a micro second time slot. Before you are each a door.
Ned 30:28
There's a catwalk that goes all the way around?
Brian 30:30
There is a catwalk that goes all the way around.
Ned 30:32
So hypothetically we could all go in the same door or we can each take our own door.
Brian 30:36
Yeah.
Andrew 30:36
Within the next 10 seconds.
Brian 30:38
No, you are on building.
Ned 30:39
We are on the thing now.
Andrew 30:40
Got it.
Brian 30:41
You are now being displaced with the tower.
Ned 30:43
I got a window, a porthole?
Brian 30:45
Nope.
Ned 30:45
Okay.
Sarah 30:45
Did you guys know the cows can scream? Because cows can scream.
Eddie 30:56
I open my door in front of me.
Brian 30:58
Would you please make a Dexterity saving throw? A natural 20.
Eddie 31:06
Nat 20.
Ned 31:06
Two in a row?
Brian 31:08
As you- uh, okay what is everyone else doing?
Sarah 31:11
I'm-
Brian 31:12
I'm not going to announce what happens because it make other people affect what they do. It's gonna, it's gonna make, it's gonna make the rest of you question what you do. Yeah.
Ned 31:20
That's exactly what the Simic Hybrid would do.
Brian 31:22
Yeah.
Ned 31:22
Simic Hybrid would be like, 'Someone open their door and I'll make a decision.'
Brian 31:26
Nope. what are other people doing?
Andrew 31:27
Lorzatch is going to open it.
Brian 31:29
Okay, um, not a Dexterity saving throw if you would please. A Constitution saving throw.
Andrew 31:34
A Constitution saving throw. Eight.
Brian 31:38
Okay, making a note, making a note. What are you doing, Fikkara?
Sarah 31:43
Oh God, do I want to just keep screaming like an idiot or I want to open the door.
Brian 31:48
Well, one of them progresses the campaign and one of them doesn't.
Sarah 31:50
Right. Right. So I think I'll open the door.
Brian 31:53
Okay. Would you please make a Wisdom saving throw?
Andrew 31:57
With exhaustion?
Brian 31:58
With exhaustion. Oh, yeah, you're, you're at disadvantage for all ability and skill checks.
Sarah 32:03
I am.
Eddie 32:04
You're the kid that would be like, 'Teacher you forgot to give me homework.'
Sarah 32:10
Oh, goody. Five.
Brian 32:13
Yep. Okay, making a note. Parax.
Ned 32:15
Oh, but I can't see what ha -I honestly wouldn't open the door.
Brian 32:19
You have no idea where anyone else is.
Ned 32:21
Because they're around the side of the thing?
Brian 32:23
Yeah.
Ned 32:23
And I hear a screaming cow?
Brian 32:25
No, because you would not be able to hear Fikkara scream because the soundwave she emitted? By the time they leave her mouth, are possibly 400 kilometers away as you're building gets displaced.
Ned 32:40
Well, then what I would do is investigate the door, like, to see if there are any magic traps.
Brian 32:45
Investigate the door.
Ned 32:46
Great. 17.
Brian 32:47
As far as you can tell, you are at a disadvantage for all skill checks. Because you're exhausted.
Ned 32:53
That one was better. That was a 19.
Brian 32:54
Great. So you're like, 'Look, I know I'm really tired, but maybe I should focus.' There are no magical traps on the door.
Ned 33:00
Then I would open the door.
Brian 33:01
Okay, would you please make a Dexterity saving three?
Ned 33:03
Yeah, for sure.
Sarah 33:04
But wait, don't you have to take the lower one if it's disadvantaged?
Brian 33:06
His lower one was a 17.
Ned 33:07
They were both good.
Sarah 33:08
Oh.
Ned 33:09
It was a 17 or a 19.
Brian 33:09
Would you please make a Dexterity saving throw?
Ned 33:12
That is a 18.
Brian 33:14
Great.
Ned 33:14
I rolled a 17 and a 16.
Brian 33:15
You rolled a 17 and 16. Good. There was no magical trap on the door. But there was an ice trap on the floor in front of your door, which you narrowly just sort of use your and amphibian capabilities just be like '(squishy sound)', 'Oh, nice try door.'
Ned 33:31
I'd actually be really fascinated by that trap. That's exciting.
Brian 33:33
Yes. Lennox, on your door as you go to reach for the knob. Very similar thing happens as you hear just a split second click and then '(metallic sound)' as a spike trap kind of pops up before the door and you narrowly get to pull your hand away before you get stabbed. As for you, Lorzatch, as you reach for your handle, you find that the handle is fucking hot. Burning. And you will receive four points of burning damage. And Fikkara as you fail your Wisdom saving throw. As you reach for your handle, there is some passive electric shock and you- but you will only take one point of shock damage.
Sarah 34:13
Okay, hey, that's not the worst.
Eddie 34:15
Was I able to open the door?
Brian 34:17
Your doors are now harmless enough that you can kind of pop open on the inside.
Eddie 34:22
So I go inside the tower.
Brian 34:25
So you all open your doors and you see that the tower itself is sort of bifurcated in a way so that Lorzatch and Lennox's doorways sort of converge together into a stairway that leads upstairs and Fikkara and Parax. Your doorways converge and head upstairs so you can see only the pair that you are with.
Ned 34:42
okay
Sarah 34:43
All right.
Brian 34:43
What would you like to do? You and Parax can now eye each other. There is a staircase before you that leads up towards the center of the tower. Similar situation for you guys. You can see each other with the staircase at least up to the top
Eddie 34:54
'Onwards.'
Andrew 34:55
'And upwards.'
Ned 34:55
Man, what I would do normally because Simic Hybrids do not rush into things. So I would sit down and I would cast a ritual of Detect Poison Disease to give me poison disease detection for a little bit.
Brian 35:09
That's fine.
Ned 35:09
Great.
Brian 35:10
It'll take you 10 minutes if you are okay doing it.
Sarah 35:12
I'm fine. I'm terrified.
Brian 35:15
You detect no poison or disease.
Ned 35:17
Right but now it's on me for the next 10 minutes of game.
Brian 35:20
Great.
Ned 35:20
Great.
Brian 35:21
Good to know. You do not detect any poison or disease.
Ned 35:23
As I go up the stairs.
Brian 35:24
What is the range on it?
Ned 35:25
30 feet.
Brian 35:26
30 feet. Okay.
Ned 35:26
And it goes through any barrier: a foot of stone, an inch of metal, three feet of wood.
Brian 35:31
I'm assuming a 30 foot sphere around you.
Ned 35:33
Yeah.
Brian 35:33
Okay, thank you good to know. At the moment you detect no poison.
Ned 35:37
Great. Then I would be going up the stairs.
Brian 35:38
Or poison or-
Ned 35:40
Disease.
Brian 35:40
Disease. You guys head up the stairs.
Ned 35:43
Great.
Brian 35:44
Would both of you please make Wisdom saving throws? Would the two of you please make Dexterity saving throws?
Ned 35:51
Love the two people with disadvantage are in a room together.
Andrew 35:53
Yeah.
Sarah 35:54
Yeah.
Eddie 35:55
Yup. That wasn't good.
Ned 36:00
I'm doing okay.
Eddie 36:01
Five.
Brian 36:02
Five isn't good.
Andrew 36:03
19.
Brian 36:04
A 19.
Sarah 36:05
I rolled a negative one!
Brian 36:07
You're rolling this high on your disadvantage? I'm proud of you.
Ned 36:09
I'm not. I'm mad because it's gonna be real bad when we get to combat.
Sarah 36:14
I'm going to die on a staircase.
Brian 36:18
So, several things happen as Lennox and Lorzatch begin to- ascending their staircase. Very quickly you hear that same distinctive click but don't manage to get out of the way this particular time. Lorzatch, you're like, 'whoa, something's on the floor,' and you pop out of the way. You Lennox, a spike trap comes up from the stairs. You receive four points of piercing damage.
Eddie 36:40
Ah.
Brian 36:41
As for the exhausted twins.
Ned 36:43
With stairs, you rude bitch.
Brian 36:46
With stairs. You saved your wisdom throw.
Ned 36:52
Yes.
Brian 36:53
Fikkara, you-
Sarah 36:54
Die of dumb.
Brian 36:56
Almost. You, you encounter a grease trap, slip, fall down the stairs.
Sarah 37:04
Okay.
Brian 37:05
You are now covered in grease.
Sarah 37:06
Oh, gross.
Brian 37:07
And you take four points of bludgeoning damage as you fall down the stairs.
Ned 37:12
I call back down the stairs, 'Don't you have that potion?'
Sarah 37:15
'I'm good. I'm good.'
Brian 37:17
And just, just as you land down the stairs-
Sarah 37:20
No.
Brian 37:21
A small-
Sarah 37:24
No!
Brian 37:24
-tube. A small cylinder to opens up and just a stream of feathers just '(small plosive sound)' all over you.
Sarah 37:35
What?! I'm a chicken!
Brian 37:41
Just sort of this like bludgeoning 'ow, ow, ow' and then this weird comical finish.
Ned 37:46
This episode is now called, 'I'm a Chicken-Cow.'
Brian 37:51
Or 'Cow and chicken.'
Landree 37:53
Oh yeah.
Ned 37:54
We might get sued.
Brian 37:54
Cow and chicken or two things that exists in the same facility. You're also prone.
Sarah 38:00
Oh, God.
Ned 38:02
Just kick her while she's down.
Brian 38:03
And you can-
Sarah 38:04
How much damage did I take again?
Ned 38:05
Four.
Brian 38:06
Four.
Sarah 38:06
Oh God.
Brian 38:07
You must succeed Dexterity saving throw to make it back up the stairs. But you can be assisted by-
Ned 38:14
Yeah. I will assist from upstairs. I'll just give you some-
Landree 38:17
I thought it was going to be fire, so-
Brian 38:22
No! This is gonna be great. It's gonna be great.
Ned 38:27
So I'm assisting you. So you're not a disadvantage but you are at normal.
Sarah 38:32
Yes, that's a fucking 17.
Brian 38:33
Great. You manage, you manage to like '(coughs and moo)' your way up the stairs. And as you guys sort of approach the top of the stairs, you realize that both of your staircases sort of apex together at the top. You see Lennox and Lorzatch,. one of them sort of limping You see the two of them, Fikkara now covered in grease and feathers, and sort of standing rather quiantly at the top of the staircase completely fine is just Zenia who finds herself in the exact spot she appeared in.
Ned 39:12
I, uh, I am taking notes the whole time because a cow-chicken hybrid is a very interesting experience.
Brian 39:20
Please take a point of inspiration for the cleverness.
Ned 39:22
Thanks.
Brian 39:23
That was great.
Sarah 39:24
I don't like this place. Can we go home?
Eddie 39:27
No.
Brian 39:29
You see as these two, as these two staircases apex there is a another larger staircase that begins spiraling its way up the inside of the tower. As you finally get a chance to sort of clear some of these traps and look at where you are. There is a twisting wretched mess of pipes and steam and it is very clearly the inside of some horribly homemade Izzet tower. Gone are the right angles and the sort of chaotic focus that comes from an Izzet facility. This is more either a very youthful Izzet person who has no idea what the heck they're doing or somebody who cared only about putting this together and if it blows up, really isn't that concerned or even aware.
Sarah 40:19
I'm going to take a health potion before I go up the next pair of stairs.
Brian 40:22
Okay.
Sarah 40:24
Cool.
Ned 40:24
That's a much better roll than before.
Sarah 40:25
Four plus- what was it plus?
Brian 40:27
2d4 plus two.
Sarah 40:29
Alright, so that's four, six. Alright, yay.
Eddie 40:32
Um, does anyone have any skills in checking for traps?
Ned 40:37
I mean I'm a good investigator and I have a really good Perception, but no I don't have, like, Detect Trap.
Landree 40:43
I'm a good investigator too.
Andrew 40:45
Would we be rolling Perception or Investigation to check traps on a spiral staircase?
Brian 40:49
I mean, you can, you can Investigate for any abnormalities.
Eddie 40:54
I- I assist him.
Andrew 40:56
That's better. 17.
Brian 40:57
No.
Landree 41:01
Nat 20.
Brian 41:02
No, you don't spot anything on the staircase.
Ned 41:04
Well, that's good cause I got a seven.
Brian 41:06
Great. Your group, momentarily displaced, is now assembled yet again. What would you like to do?
Eddie 41:13
I start walking up the staircase
Brian 41:15
Please make a Dexterity saving throw.
Ned 41:20
Alright.
Eddie 41:21
17.
Brian 41:21
Would the rest of you please now make a dexterity saving throw?
Ned 41:25
Yeah, sure, Brian. Why not?!
Andrew 41:31
22
Brian 41:33
22.
Sarah 41:34
It's a 16.
Brian 41:35
Great.
Landree 41:35
12.
Brian 41:36
A 12.
Landree 41:36
13.
Brian 41:37
A 13
Unknown Speaker 41:38
Oh wait! Dexterity. That makes me a ninja. A
Andrew 41:40
21 great.
Brian 41:42
So Xenia rolled the lowest.
So as you begin to ascend up this staircase, just a piece of equipment on a piece of rope just comes swinging down from on high the minute you turn around. Lennox, always the keen eye, immediately just, 'whoa', dodges out of the way as everyone else proceeds to just look out of the way and this piece of equipment on a rope will smack Zenia directly in the face. For one point of bludgeoning damage.
Ned 42:12
Turns out that this is from an Izzet named Kevin McCallister.
Sarah 42:18
'Gnome Alone.'
Brian 42:20
Would you please- Would you please make a marching order up the stairs.
Eddie 42:23
I'll go first.
Ned 42:24
I will happily go in the middle.
Andrew 42:27
Lorzatch will be second.
Sarah 42:29
Can I just watch the bottom of the stairs?
Ned 42:31
I feel the Izzet should be towards the front.
Landree 42:34
Yeah, I can lead.
Brian 42:34
Okay, who is in front? That is your marching order? Great. Zenia, would you please make a Dexterity saving throw?
Landree 42:41
Yeah. Oh, six!
Brian 42:45
Oh, a second pail comes raining down from the sky and hits you in the face. You should have seen this coming. For two bludgeoning damage.
Landree 42:54
She- She looks a little cross eyed but she's still in a great mood. She's having a great time.
As you begin ascending up the staircase, would everyone for a third time please make a Dexterity saving throw?
Ned 43:05
Yeah, Brian, why not?
Eddie 43:09
17.
Brian 43:10
Good.
Ned 43:10
Five.
Brian 43:11
Five.
Landree 43:12
Also 5.
Brian 43:12
A 14. Okay, anyone with a 13 or under: this time from the side, a large piece of pipe on a rope, the exact length of your adventuring party, comes swinging down from on high. Anyone who rolled below a 13 will take two points of bludgeoning damage.
Sarah 43:13
14.
Ned 43:30
Sure. Cuz why not?
Brian 43:33
You guys then begin your long ascent of the step.
Ned 43:37
Arduous journey.
Brian 43:38
There are 144 steps, each of which will-
Landree 43:41
'(noise)'
Brian 43:41
nah, I'm joking.
Andrew 43:43
Oh my God.
Landree 43:44
This is how we all die.
Brian 43:45
But it doesn't take it, doesn't take very long for you, Parax, to sense poison from the top of the staircase.
Ned 43:54
So I would alert the group to this immediately.
Brian 43:56
Yes. Oh ,you know, you-
Ned 43:57
I get to know what kind of poison and it's exact location.
Brian 44:00
At the very top of the staircase you can sense spider poison.
Ned 44:03
Is there a spider or is it spider poison? Because it's- I can do poisonous creatures or kind of poison.
Brian 44:08
There is a poisonous spider at the top of the staircase
Ned 44:10
'Guys, there's a poisonous spider at the top of the stairs.'
Brian 44:15
What would you guys like to do it? Yes, Zenia?
Landree 44:17
Can I- can I cast false life on myself?
Brian 44:20
Yes.
Landree 44:20
Okay. Okay, great. So I heal seven points.
Brian 44:24
Okay. Within 30 feet you are about to encounter-
Ned 44:29
Is there one spider just a singular?
Brian 44:31
There's just a singular spider and it is big.
Ned 44:33
Okay, big poisonous spider.
Sarah 44:35
Okay.
Ned 44:35
I can walk up with Burning Hands and I do pretty good with poison damage, but I don't have a great armor class. So that's a hit or miss here.
Eddie 44:43
I walk up.
Ned 44:44
Great.
Eddie 44:45
I cast Shield of Faith on myself and I walk up the stairs.
Brian 44:47
Okay. You can see at the top that there is a large door that looks to lead whatever to the room is at the top of the staircase. As you approach you hear this sort of stuff steam grinding of mechanical gears and hissing and clanking. And this sort of mechanical steampunk spider just sort of drops down onto the staircase with the sort of '( mechanical sounds)' 'click click click click click' of its mandibles. We're going to take initiative based on marching order. So Lennox please What would you like to do?
Eddie 45:24
I smack it with my mace.
Brian 45:26
Please make an attack roll.
Eddie 45:28
I don't smack it with my mace.
Brian 45:30
You miss with your mace. Who is next? Zenia.
Landree 45:32
I cast Chill Touch for 11.
Brian 45:37
11 hits.
Landree 45:38
Oh, great.
Brian 45:40
It's very big. It's hard to miss.
Eddie 45:41
Well, wait. Wait. Maybe, I do, I do hit it then.
Brian 45:43
What'd you roll?
Eddie 45:45
So I actually thought this was a one.
Brian 45:48
Yes.
Andrew 45:48
It's a seven.
Eddie 45:49
It looks like a one to me.
Brian 45:50
Seven plus five. So I will allow both of you to attack simultaneously so, so, so we don't ruin the credit from somebody.
Landree 45:59
So I've got five and you got eight.
Eddie 46:01
Die a lie, I don't roll a die 8.
Ned 46:03
What do you roll here? What's happening?
Brian 46:04
D six?
Eddie 46:05
Yeah. Four points of damage.
Brian 46:08
Great. So Lennox raises his mace.
Eddie 46:10
'Begone creature.'
Brian 46:12
At the same time that Zenia kind of casts some magic in on the thing. And they smash both at the same time and this big, threatening mechanical spider, without any effort at all, immediately '(shorting out machinery sounds)' just and then just sort of falls and tumbles down the cavity where the staircase is posing like, posing like zero threat at all. Leaving just this, just this doorway at the top. And if you have been following along it is the 'Home Alone house trap sequence.
Ned 46:43
Yeah, ah, yes. Yeah.
Eddie 46:45
I walk up to the door to, uh, I Investigate. Will someone assist me?
Landree 46:50
I'll assist.
Brian 46:51
It doesn't take really an investigation. Oh, if you want to see if there's traps or something like that?
Eddie 46:55
Yeah
Brian 46:55
Please go ahead.
Eddie 46:57
It's just an 11. I know my Investigation is not very good.
Brian 47:00
There doesn't seem to be any trap associated with the door.
Eddie 47:03
I open the door.
Brian 47:03
It's locked. It is locked, though it will take some sort of concerted effort to open it.
Sarah 47:09
It's a 17 for taking down the door.
Brian 47:11
Yeah, so with a mighty Minotaur hoof you '(moo)' just kick down the door.
As you guys sort of tumble into this sort of apex- what looks to be actually an observatory, everyone's hair sort of staticly starts kind of lifting away from their bodies except for Parax and Zenia who are Veldaken in original nature and don't have any hair. But for the rest of the three of you, you do hear this sort of static electric 'pling.' For a Minotaur this is probably most unsettling.
Andrew 47:42
A large beetle crawls out of Lorzatch's hair.
Brian 47:45
As your entire body is just sort of '(unpleasant sounds(' almost feels like you're lifting.
Sarah 47:51
With the feathers it, oh God...
Brian 47:53
Yeah, those of you wearing armor though, there seems to be this sort of like metallic ting going on around your armor. There's just an incredible amount of static electricity emanating within this room. Zenia, you're probably just taking a bath at this point.
Landree 48:07
I was just gonna say, Zenia is so excited, but also so jealous of their hair. So she just keeps playing, playing with static electricity on you guys.
Brian 48:16
So what you see is the room itself is a large circular laboratory. And now taking up the majority of the center of this room is a large glass vessel filled with a boiling, clear, colorless liquid. And shooting off of this vessel is a network of glass tubes entering progressively smaller glass orbs, each of them partially filled with whatever this liquid is. Now the laboratory itself is an absolute mess. Everywhere there are piles of tubes, beakers, there's like papers strewn everywhere, half eaten food, half drunken cups of whatever.
Now on the far wall, you will see a small,aged Goblin draped in clothes that are far too big for him and he is cowering amongst a pile of papers. But what you see in his hand is a rather dangerous looking pistol that he's pointing at you.
On the next Encounter Party! Trapped in a tower teleporting out of control, our players confront a Goblin who knows more than he can remember. Zenia's chaotic mind takes to the field to unravel a forgotten secret. Is the Goblin friend or foe? The mystery of the orb and much more finally revealed next time on Encounter Party!

Last time on, Encounter Party! Thanks to Zenia's guild connections, our players discover that Malfus Reid was using the Izzet powerplant as a staging ground for his master plans. Hot on the trail of mysterious power surges, our players must exit the quarantine to continue their investigation. However their only way out is through Golgari incursion tunnels swarming with raiding parties. Will Lorzatch be able to broker safe passage? Find out this week on Encounter Party!
Back once again in Zonot Four, you have done your best to convince to Master Biomancer Vezara to lift the quarantine so you may investigate outside the compound. She has refused in order to not only protect her own career, but because the quarantine itself has not yet been cleared. However, the Golgari have been attempting to burrow into the bottom of the Zonot and you may be able to use their tunnels to reach outside. Parax, I believe, has mutations allowing him to travel underwater and he will be able to use them to aid you down below the well.
Sarah 1:23
We're going to go through the water to get there?
Brian 1:25
Um, kinda. I mean you can't breathe underwater, so you'll be in like some sort of balloon.
Sarah 1:33
Ooh.
Brian 1:34
So with the plan's approval, you are led all the way down to the bottom of the Zonot. Down to where you fought that terrible mutating Krasis. And also where you lost your companion Brevan.
You went to what is clearly a diving chamber, um, and there is a gelatinous bubble resting in the center of the room on a raised platform. Parax will wait patiently on the floor, while the remaining four of you are sort of led through this sticky, gooey membrane into the inside of the bubble.
There is nowhere to sit inside this thing so you all have to huddle awkwardly together as all the Simic members who cannot breathe underwater will exit the room. The chamber itself will slowly fill with water. As Parax and Vezara begin releasing the bubble from its restrainment clamps. Vezara will give a very professional dismissal and Parax swims above the bubble, and then begins gently pushing you down through a cavity that is open at the bottom of the chamber. And with Parax at the helm, you descend into the depths of the well with only the light of his amulet to guide you.
Parax, would you please give me an Athletics check?
Ned 2:52
Oh, that is the worst check.
That would be a zero.
Brian 2:59
A zero?
Ned 3:00
Yeah, that would be a natural one with a minus one.
Brian 3:03
Ah great. That sucks for you.
Sarah 3:07
And that's how we died.
Okay, the major thing that you notice is that when the, the four of these guys that purged the bottom levels of the Zonot? The explosions that separated the building from the wall left untold damage upon the rock face, making it very confusing for you to navigate this waterway. Now that the well has been damaged, any Golgari tunnels that were attempting to breach the side of the Zonot that are all probably caved in. And so you will need to hunt for a long time, much longer than you have the energy for.
Parax, you will suffer one level of Exhaustion before you finally discover a portal up and under a rocky crevasse. There is a pocket where the waterline rests as it connects to a chamber of air. So you rise out of the water into a cave with a single long tunnel that stretches out into the dark. Now, whether or not this is what you were searching for, that's difficult to tell with such a poor roll. Parax cannot drag a bubble with four people inside of it. So as you breach the water, the bubble will dissipate. stranding your party underground in a pitch black cave.
Eddie 4:19
I cast light on my shield.
Brian 4:20
You cast light on your shield.
Andrew 4:22
Lorzatch winces.
Ned 4:23
Ah, me too as a dark vision user.
Brian 4:25
As a dark vision user.
Ned 4:27
I would love to step a little forward so I'm maybe not in the sphere.
Brian 4:29
Ok. What you can see is a long, stretching tunnel wide enough for several people to pass through together and it has been dug out. This is not naturally occurring. It has been dug out in some fashion and you can only see for some distance before there is a sharp bend in the tunnel preventing you from seeing any further. So a very limited field of view right now and the only way forward is through the hole.
'(deep chuckle)'
Sarah 4:57
'When we go back can we not go back that way?'
Ned 4:59
Great work Flemming. Really fantastic work there.
Eddie 5:07
'Onwards.' I start walking down the-
Andrew 5:09
Lorzatch is going to be at the front of the party.
Ned 5:12
I would always like to be at the front of the party for the sake of eyeballs not in light.
Sarah 5:15
'When we go back can we not go back that way?'
Brian 5:18
Can we please establish a marching order?
Which is DM speak for '(evil laughter)'
Eddie 5:20
I'll stay closest to-
Ned 5:28
No, you have the damn shield.
Brian 5:30
Choose the order in which you die.
Ned 5:32
I can see 60 feet you can see 30, but I can't see 60 when I'm in your damn light.
Eddie 5:37
'(unintelligeble)'
Ned 5:37
No! Cause I have Darkvision so if you make a bright light I resume normal light
Andrew 5:44
A hundred and 20 feet Superior Darkvision.
Landree 5:47
Bitch
Sarah 5:47
I'll bring up the rear.
Landree 5:48
I also cast Frank-
Ned 5:51
Aw, dammit.
Brian 5:52
Their light sources are mobile beyond the range of your Darkvision.
Ned 5:55
Right.
Brian 5:55
So while you're grumbling that it is suddenly light. Perhaps your teammates are a little bit happier.
Ned 6:02
Yeah.
Eddie 6:02
Yeah, well, cuz like I can't see without it so deal with it.
Landree 6:06
Right.
Brian 6:07
So Frank is, so, you've coalesced all four lights into Frank-
Landree 6:11
Into Frank.
Brian 6:11
And is Frank sort of walking out in front of you or is he sort of walking beside you?
Landree 6:16
Frank is actually behind me because I can sense Fikkara is a little nervous. So he's casting a little bit of light in front of me but also walking next to her because Zenia is misguided in thinking that Frank is comforting whatsoever. So.
Brian 6:29
Okay, great.
As you proceed down the tunnel, before you actually reach this first bend to the right, would everyone please make a Perception check? Lorzatch, you may make yours with advantage.
Andrew 6:46
9
Eddie 6:46
12
Ned 6:47
13
Sarah 6:48
One.
Brian 6:50
Wow, you guys really don't hear anything.
There is this sort of unsettling deadness to the air as, as every step you take and even your own breath, just sort of echoes and ripples down off the cavern walls. Um, even though there is this sort of audible solitude, you can feel the presence of something else. And it only takes about 30 to 40 more paces before you can hear the, the sound of fluttering wings from around the bend.
As you make your way about another 30 to 40 feet, the unmistakable flittering of wings becomes very apparent to those of you in the front.
Eddie 7:34
'Brace yourselves for battle.'
Brian 7:36
And that's exactly what's about to happen.
So as you approach the bend you immediately notice what can only be described as a swarm of Kraul Warriors. Now the Kraul are an insectile race that inhabit the Undercity. They are part of the Golgari Guild. Um, and they are large, multi-limbed insectile beings kind of like mantises, and they do have the power of flight. And they, they operate large spears and bows that use four arms apiece to wield. And two of them break off from the swarm and approach your group demanding that you halt as they address Lorzatch in the front.
'(insect snarling)' 'Now.'
Andrew 8:22
Lorzatch replies in Kraul.
Brian 8:24
You speak Kraul? Yes. What would you like to say to them?
Andrew 8:27
'They pose no danger. They are with me.'
Brian 8:31
'But you bring outsiders.'
Andrew 8:34
'The Dimir threaten the city. They join me in battle against the Dimir.'
Brian 8:40
'But you bring light. You bring terrible light.'
Andrew 8:44
To which Lorzatch looks back at Lennox. 'Snuff out the shield, please.'
Eddie 8:49
'I can't see without it.'
Andrew 8:51
'I will see for you. Now.'
Eddie 8:55
I turn it off.
Landree 8:56
Oh, Frank. I'll see you in a bit.
Brian 8:59
Immediately after you extinguish your light, you can hear more Kraul wings flittering as they approach, safe now that there isn't so much light in the tunnel. And you hear this strange alien clicking and wing flittering language traveling back and forth down the line of Kraul in this tunnel. And the thing that concerns you, Lorzatch, is the moment you realize that they recognize that there is a Simic guild member down here. And the threat sort of passes down the line if perhaps more than you were expecting to be down the tunnel of:
'The Simic. They bring that Simic down here.'
Would everyone please roll initiative?
Let's roll initiative!
Landree 9:42
Not rolling good today.
Andrew 9:48
15.
Eddie 9:49
Nine.
Landree 9:50
Five.
Sarah 9:51
There may also be a whining from the back of the tilt line.
Brian 9:56
'Guys I don't want to mooooooove.""
Sarah 10:04
'Moooooove.'
Brian 10:04
'(cow noises)'
So now that your lights are extinguished, you hear all of this skittering as many. many Kraul warriors begin to descend upon you. And not just laterally to the left and the right, but also above you. And those of you in the back can hear these insectile warriors crawling on the ceiling above you as as these things just sort of swarm upon you. And those of you at the front, being Parax and Lorzatch, with your Darkvision you can see down the tunnel. There is a much larger Kraul warrior carrying a big staff and draped in, like, moss robes with this horrific white skull painted on its carapace face and they are clearly directing all of the Kraul warriors with what's about to happen. First up is Parax.
Ned 10:57
Parax immediately grabs his crystal which grows, which glows purple. The purple essence moves to his hand and he points at the wall grabbing in large boulder from it and hurling it at the front- What are we fighting?
Andrew 11:07
Kraul.
Brian 11:07
They're Kraul. warriors .The i- the bug guys.
Ned 11:10
Hurling it at the front bug guy. Ah, that is a Dex save 14 for you.
Brian 11:16
For the first guy?
Ned 11:17
Yeah.
Brian 11:17
I'm going to suspect these things have crap all Cons- Oh, Dexterity? Well, that's a natural one so he just is not prepared for whatever is about to happen.
Ned 11:24
Okay great.
Brian 11:25
Fairly dexterous. Pretty shit with Charisma.
Ned 11:28
12-21 points of bludgeoning damage.
Brian 11:30
21 points of bludgeoning damage?
Ned 11:33
48.
Brian 11:34
Whoa. Yeah, I mean, you hear this, like, rock that you've kind of summoned and chucked right at this insect. Rocks and insects don't really marry very well together. And you just hear this sort of sickening crunch and sort of a squeal like, '(squeal)' as like several things broke.
Ned 11:54
Cool.
Brian 11:54
And you can see in your Darkvision, it kind of like looks like it's trying to, like, get itself back up off the ground, but like a wing is broken and probably its thorax is splintered. And goo is pouring out a little bit, like, that was a massive swing
Ned 12:07
And then I'm going to pull back so that I'm in the direct center of the group.
Brian 12:09
Okay.
Ned 12:10
I just want to have as much people for protection as possible. I die quick.
'Sup Minotaur?'
Brian 12:16
Fikkara.
Ned 12:16
'(chuckle)' 'Lennox.'
Sarah 12:18
Uh, I am going to- who is next for-
Brian 12:21
You can hear that there are things next to you. You do not have Darkvision and you are currently in the dark.
Sarah 12:26
Okay, um, I hear something behind me though, right?
Brian 12:29
You hear things all around you.
Sarah 12:30
Okay, I'll can concentrate and stuff behind me first.
Brian 12:34
You can try and make a wild swing, you just attack with a disadvantage.
Oh, no, I wasn't gonna take wild swing. I was gonna do Earth Tremor. Which I'm sure is a great idea to do under the ground.
Ned 12:42
Oh.
Brian 12:42
Oh.
Sarah 12:43
Yeah.
Brian 12:43
Okay.
Sarah 12:44
So, um, we're gonna turn around.
Brian 12:46
Oh, this is that part where DMs go, 'Oh...' That's a really good idea that I have to prepare for.
Ned 12:53
Please.
Eddie 12:54
What is that? I don't even know.
Brian 12:56
Well, I'm sure she's about to tell you.
Sarah 12:58
Right. Um, okay. So-
Brian 12:59
You're gonna use Earth Tremor.
Sarah 13:00
Yes.
Brian 13:01
So everyone within five feet of you makes a Dexterity saving throw.
Sarah 13:06
Yes.
Ned 13:06
That includes us.
Brian 13:07
Each creature, so including-
Sarah 13:09
Sorry, guys
Brian 13:10
Zenia and Parax.
Ned 13:11
It's okay.
Sarah 13:13
Target's 13.
Ned 13:14
I didn't get there.
Landree 13:15
I also did not
Brian 13:18
Two of them do, one of them does not. The one behind your right shoulder failed.
Sarah 13:23
Okay, so anybody who fails is one D6 bludgeoning and are knocked prone. 'The ground in the area is loose earth or stone. It becomes difficult terrain until cleared. With each five foot diameter portion requiring at least one minute to clear by hand.' And they're going to take two damage.
Ned 13:42
K.
Brian 13:43
Okay, so that one is knocked prone. Also, players are knocked prone and within 10 feet around Fikkara is difficult terrain so it's half movement to move through.
Ned 13:53
Copy. So if we stand up in it, that's it. Because that's half movement to get up.
Brian 13:57
Yes.
Sarah 13:57
Yeah. And then I'll do Bardic Inspiration for Lennox. 'Lennox, um, you have Light. You can do this. I believe in you!'
Eddie 14:05
'Much appreciated.'
Ned 14:06
Rock on.
Brian 14:07
Okay. Lorzatch, could you please remind me what sort of Elven immunities you have?
Ned 14:11
That's a terrifying sentence.
Brian 14:13
Well, the Kraul would know this because he's Devkarin.
Andrew 14:16
Advantage against being Charmed and magic can't put you to sleep.
Landree 14:20
Nice.
Brian 14:20
Okay, but you can be Enfeebled.
Ned 14:24
This is true.
Sarah 14:25
That's an awful word.
Landree 14:25
'(chuckle)'
Andrew 14:26
Okay.
Brian 14:27
Crawling down the tunnel, sort of half on the ground, half on the wall, you recognize this larger Kraul is a Death Priest. And it spots you and recognizes you Devkarin. And maybe there is some deep seated racial tension between you or perhaps it thinks that you are working with the Simic in some capacity, but you just see this long insecttile finger reach out in front of it and point at you. And this hiss of hatred emits from the priest as a thin, barely glowing black laser shoots out of its finger toward you. Um, and it will roll a 14 to hit you.
It does not hit you. So, you immediately recognize that whatever comes out of the finger of a Death Priest is definitely not something you want to get hit by. So in that split second, when you can recognize an attack is coming, you shift yourself sideways trying to narrow the target as much as you can, as this black laser sort of comes humming by your chest.
Andrew 15:11
It does not.
Brian 15:33
It is now actually your turn. So this, this sort of dodge that you make also preps your next action and you can ready yourself for what you're going to do.
Andrew 15:45
Lorzatch hates everything that is happening in this tunnel and bows his head, his face blushing red, like a leaf that's fallen from a bough of a tree. As he awakens all the spores that are coming out of the vents that are in his armor. Cups one hand over the other, draws it out in a straight line, and a flaming scimitar appears in his hand. And he sets his gaze on the Death Priest at the far end of the tunnel. End of turn.
You can now see with light is shed by the blade in a 10 foot radius.
Brian 16:15
So Fikkara, as somebody standing outside of the 10 foot radius, you can see what is inside the 10 foot radius and between it, but you don't have any vision for what is still around you.
Sarah 16:26
Right.
Brian 16:28
So that light: while it is helping your teammates see, has also just painted a direct target as to where a couple of archers in the back here are going to fire upon you. So they are going to shoot once at Lorzatch and twice at whatever this being in shining white armor is. So the first attack against Lorzatch will miss and then for you Lennox, here comes a 15 and a 16.
Your Armor Class is what? 18?
Eddie 16:58
18 player.
Brian 17:00
So you feel a couple of small, really kind of poorly made arrows, just sort of hailing out of the dark. Lennox, you are now up.
Eddie 17:09
Lennox casts Light on his shield and then cast Shield of Faith on himself.
Brian 17:17
Okay.
Eddie 17:18
And those are his actions.
Brian 17:19
Right. So, Fikkara.
Sarah 17:22
Yeah?
Brian 17:22
Sitting in the back, out of the light, you know that there are things around you.
Sarah 17:27
Yeah.
Brian 17:27
How many you do not know, but you're starting to notice that your Earth Tremor was a fairly successful attack and something dropped to the ground behind you. But that thing now gets up and, more importantly, they're not just behind you. They're above you. And you feel a flurry of spears come poking down at you from the ceiling, perhaps in an area your armor is not meant to defend.
Sarah 17:50
I'm not okay with this.
Brian 17:50
They are frighteningly coordinated. So the first attack is going to be a 21. The second one will be a six, which I I'm assuming will miss. And the third one is a 16.
Sarah 18:04
So the, the 21 and the 16'll hit.
Brian 18:06
Yes. The 16 will hit. Okay, yeah so you get two attacks
Sarah 18:09
Yeah.
Brian 18:09
So the first one will deal-
Sarah 18:12
Roll a one, roll a one.
Brian 18:13
-five piercing damage and the second one will deal eight piercing damage.
Sarah 18:17
Ow. That's unpleasant.
Eddie 18:20
We got to get your Armor Class up, girl.
Brian 18:23
Zenia. 16 is pretty good.
Sarah 18:24
Yeah.
Brian 18:25
16's pretty good.
Sarah 18:25
It's not awful.
Brian 18:26
She's not- it'd be 18 if she was wielding a shield, but she's not.
Eddie 18:29
Not as cute as my 20, but like whatever.
Landree 18:31
Oh shit.
Brian 18:32
Excuse me, temporary 20. Come back to me in an hour and we'll see how we're talking. Zenia. First thing you need to do is stand up. Although you don't actually need to but-
Ned 18:49
Yeah, probably not gonna.
Landree 18:50
I don't need to to cast a spell or anything?
Brian 18:52
Right, but I would suggest that you do stand up before any sort of-
Landree 18:55
Fair enough.
Brian 18:55
-inadvertent disadvantage role.
Landree 18:57
And now let me double, let me double check as well.
Brian 19:00
Yes.
Landree 19:00
I can see 10 feet, a 10 foot radius here?
Brian 19:04
You can see everything except for what is attacking Fikkara and what is around the corner.
Landree 19:10
Oh, ok. Ok. Ok.
Brian 19:11
So you are aware of where all of your teammates are.
Landree 19:14
Great. Okay, so Zenia heaves a great sigh cuz she just did not want to deal with this. And she brushes off her clothes. She hates the texture of dirt. And she rubs her hands together and she casts Chill Touch on that motherfucker in the front row.
Brian 19:35
You do not have line of sight to that motherfucker in the front.
Landree 19:37
Oh, I dont?
Ned 19:37
Wall in the way.
Landree 19:38
Do I have here?
Brian 19:39
Yes you do.
Landree 19:39
Oh, okay.
Brian 19:40
You can mother fuck that fucker mother.
Landree 19:42
I'm going to- I'm going to mother fuck a particularly different motherfucker. Also in the front row. It is 20.
Brian 19:56
Non-natural?
Landree 19:57
No, non-natural.
Brian 19:58
Okay, please roll some damage.
Landree 20:03
For one feisty, really trying point of necrotic damage.
Brian 20:10
So that is the same Kraul warrior that took a boulder to the face. And is seemingly just kind of getting himself centered after being kind of proud that he actually got an arrow off in response to that attack. And suddenly he gets a bit of a flick with magical power like, like 'really?!' Like it's more of an annoyance at this point. But it's enough to kind of get him to kind of refocus as to what's going on here.
Landree 20:33
You see it just a little dead looking hand flicking in-between his eyes.
Brian 20:41
Back to the top. Parax. Round two
Ned 20:44
Round two. So I stand up.
Brian 20:46
Yes.
Ned 20:46
Which is my full movement possibility, correct? I guess I could move seven more feet mathematically. But anyway, it's not a good option. Uh, so, man there is a Minotaur in the way of what I want to do and I will kill her if I do it. So!
Sarah 21:00
Are you sure?
Ned 21:01
I won't do it! Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Sarah 21:02
Positive?
Ned 21:03
It's-
Sarah 21:03
Cuz I'm pretty cool.
Ned 21:04
4d6.
Landree 21:05
Oof.
Sarah 21:06
I can do it.
Brian 21:07
They are on the walls and the ceiling.
Ned 21:09
Can I fire up?
Brian 21:10
You can fi-
Ned 21:11
15 foot cone?
Brian 21:11
Yes, but as a 15 foot cone.
Ned 21:14
Right.
Brian 21:14
So it also goes 15 feet up. So if you're shooting a cone you will hit her.
Ned 21:18
Right. This is the problem.
Brian 21:19
Yes.
Ned 21:20
This is why I will not do this.
Brian 21:21
Yes. On a map we look at it as sort of a triangle, 'oh', but it is a 15 foot diameter cone. Yes.
Ned 21:28
And if I shoot it straight up that's bad for everybody.
So I'm not gonna do it.
Brian 21:30
Right .
Yes, it cones out until it reaches a diameter of 15 feet.
Ned 21:34
What is my line of sight? Oh, none of this is good. Here we go. I grab the crystal in the crystal glows a light blue and I reach out and I touch Fikkara casting Enhance Ability. And I'm giving Fikkara the Bull's Strength for advantage on all Strength checks.
Brian 21:52
Great. So Fikkara, momentarily, the hair on your arms and shoulders stick up a little stiffer. You horns seem a little bit heavier, a little bit sharper and grow just a little bit bigger. And the bull side of your race takes over just a little bit as whatever the bovine equivalent of feral seems to take you just a little bit more.
'Mm. Grass. More grass.'
Not he direction I was expecting.
Uh, the Death Priest saunters forward a little bit more, trying to get a better picture of what it is facing. And seeing now the light coming out of the shield of the Azorius, the Kraul priest pulls it staff to the side and lifts up one of the second arms on the right side of its body and points a different ray at you.
Eddie 22:50
No sir, I don't like it.
Brian 22:51
Please make a Constitution saving throw, Lennox.
Eddie 22:55
It's a natural one.
Brian 22:58
A natural one. It is going to make attack on you. It is going to be a 19.
Eddie 23:02
Damage?
Brian 23:03
No, a 19 to hit.
Eddie 23:04
Oh, that misses.
Brian 23:06
Your armor class is a 20- I'm so sorry. It is a plus five to hit. It is a 20 exactly. I will show you the role. 15 plus five is a 20.
So, you are going to- no, cuz the people-no, the people on the people on the audio are gonna be like 'oh, he cheated.' It's like 'No, no, no, make sure we see the role.' 15 plus five is 20. Um, you are going to take 11 poison damage. And you are also poisoned with the failed Constitution saving throw. So you have disadvantage on attacks and ability checks until the end of your next turn.
Eddie 23:16
I believe you. '(laughs)'
AD BREAK
Brian 24:15
Fikkara.
Sarah 24:16
Yes.
Brian 24:17
You are up. Everything around you is in range.
Sarah 24:20
Okay. Right, right. It's just a matter of- I can't see them. Correct?
Brian 24:24
You can't see them, but you can attack them. So the light emanating from your shield is just forward. So you are not currently in like-
Eddie 24:31
I mean, the whole shield. I mean, like if my shield is out like this, it would, it's the whole object.
Brian 24:36
What is the, what is the radius on the light? Does it give you a radius or?
Eddie 24:41
Yes it does.
Brian 24:42
Well, I would say, I would say I suppose if you were casting on anything that wasn't sort of a directional shield, then it would radiate light. So it's what? 10 feet?
Eddie 24:50
No, it's more than that. But I think it's like, only 20
Brian 24:52
At least 20?
Eddie 24:53
Yes.
Brian 24:54
Yeah, I would say you can see them. You can make attack rolls normally now.
Sarah 24:57
Okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Sounds good. Cause...
Brian 25:01
Cuz technically that light is obstructed normally, but if he cast it on anything that wasn't like a plate, it would be radiating light. So let's just assume it's radiating.
Sarah 25:09
Okay, cool. Then I-
Brian 25:10
You now look around and you see three large-
Eddie 25:13
It's actually 40 feet, it's- I'm sorry, it's 20 feet of bright light. Another 20 feet of dim light.
Brian 25:18
Of dim light. Thank you very much for the clarification.
Sarah 25:21
Thanks.
Brian 25:21
So as soon as your teammate has cast this light, sort of illuminated the pocket of where you guys are, you can see, like, on the walls above you are three massive insectile warriors with very long spears as they're trying to skewer you from above.
Sarah 25:37
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and attack the one that's over my right shoulder.
Brian 25:42
Okay.
Sarah 25:43
And I'm just gonna scream, 'Come down and fight me bitches!' And 'boom, boom!' with both maces.
Brian 25:48
Make some attack rolls, please.
Andrew 25:50
Which you have advantage on.
Sarah 25:51
So that'll be for one attack which will be a 11.
Brian 25:56
11 will not hit.
Sarah 25:57
Okay. And the other one is going to be a 21.
Brian 26:03
A 21 will hit.
Sarah 26:04
Alright, cool. Yay. And that will be 10 damage.
Brian 26:08
10 damage.
Ned 26:09
Great work, Fikkara.
Brian 26:10
You give it a pretty good crack. You hear some exoskeleton crunch. It skitters slightly down the wall but it's nothing really to disrupt it much but it perhaps wants to find a different purchase. Maybe the next mace won't hurt it quite so badly.
Lorzatch.
Andrew 26:25
Lorzatch runs forward to the cadre of Kraul and the Death Priest in their midst and strikes the wounded one with a flaming scimitar and will an 18 hit?
Brian 26:37
An 18 just hits. Take note.
Andrew 26:40
And will a 15 hit?
Brian 26:43
18 is the target number.
Andrew 26:44
Forget it. And-
Brian 26:46
They have insectile armor and probably other pits of dried bark and leather.
Andrew 26:53
So that was 16 damage, four of which is poison.
Brian 26:57
How does it happen?
Andrew 26:58
As the Kraul warrior raises one of its arms to defend itself, the flaming blade catches it between it's chitinous plate, severing one arm as the dagger plunges into its compound eye.
Brian 27:08
You just hear this horrible squeal that is a half vocal squeal but also half sort of like gas escaping a valve. It's this sort of '(squeal)' as this thing just sort of crumbles into a hideous mess and part of its limbs just sort of '(crunching sounds)' curl up in on itself.
Andrew 27:30
'Your foolishness as accelerated your cycle.'
Brian 27:34
Oh, I'm going to make Constitution saving throws on the minor ones around you. Yeah, they hear your language and even though they were attempted to be Frightened, they think your dialect is a bit silly and you mispronounced a word or two.
Andrew 27:51
He doesn't have wings it's fine.
Brian 27:54
So the warriors who were, yes, so that one Kraul warrior's dead that you just stabbed. The other one around you- so there's the Death Priests there and then there are the two other archers with you. One of them pulls back its bow and shoots at you again. The one behind the Death Priest. That roll's a 12.
Andrew 28:12
It does not hit.
Brian 28:13
A 12 does not hit. And the other one drops its bow as you are now within range for its spear.
Andrew 28:19
They didn't make a Constitution saving throw?
Brian 28:21
Now it will make a Constitution saving throw. It rolled a six.
Andrew 28:27
It takes six necrotic damage.
Brian 28:29
It takes six necrotic damage. And it will attack you again, surprisingly coordinated with this spear strike. And it will roll a 14.
Andrew 28:40
It misses.
Brian 28:41
A 14 misses. As Andrew throws some very silent middle fingers toward the DM. Lennox, you are up.
Eddie 28:48
Lennox heals himself. For max healing.
Brian 28:52
You guys roll max-
Ned 28:54
YEAH!
Brian 28:54
-healing. You've done it for the entire campaign. I'm not kidding. You have rolled max healing die on everything that you're doing.
Sarah 29:02
He got powers.
Eddie 29:02
He is now fully healed.
Brian 29:03
Crap.
Eddie 29:05
And he summons the power of his Spiritual Weapon. '(Eddie sound effect)' It makes that sound. The Spiritual Weapon appears out of thin air, floating. It is a spectral weapon.
Brian 29:23
What does it look like?
Eddie 29:23
A glimmering blue mace.
Brian 29:26
Okay.
Eddie 29:27
Come on, death mace.
Landree 29:28
Oh, yeah.
Eddie 29:29
And it smacks at-
Brian 29:31
Does the, uh, does the Spiritual Weapon have hit points? Can I destroy the Spiritual Weapon? Or do I just have to like, take it.
Eddie 29:37
Doesn't say anything about hit points or anything like that.
Brian 29:40
How long, how long is the-
Eddie 29:41
A minute.
Brian 29:42
Okay. So it lasts for a minute and then it goes away.
Eddie 29:44
And then '(sound effect)' Do I have advantage on this attack from my, from the Bardic Inspiration?
Ned 29:49
It's a d6.
Sarah 29:49
It's only six.
Brian 29:50
No, an additional D6-
Eddie 29:51
Oh, it's a d6. I'm sorry.
Brian 29:51
So you make your role and then add a d6 and I believe you can choose until after the roll to decide whether or not to use.
Eddie 29:57
Great. Um, I'll use the d6.
Ned 30:00
Hello, Bardic Inspiration!
Sarah 30:01
Hooray!
Ned 30:02
Yeah.
Eddie 30:03
Hit.
Sarah 30:03
Hooray!
Ned 30:05
What number'd ya hit, Eddie?
An 18.
Brian 30:06
An 18?
Eddie 30:06
Yup.
Brian 30:07
An 18 just hits. Please do some damage.
Sarah 30:10
I'm a helper.
Eddie 30:12
Seven points of damage.
Brian 30:14
Seven points of damage to the face.
Ned 30:16
Yeah! Bam, bam, BAM!
Sarah 30:17
In your bug face.
Brian 30:18
So the, uh, Death Priest as it's concentrating on kind of dealing with this Golgatri traitor, out of nowhere this big blue mace just sort of appears in front of his face and sort of cartoonishly just 'dong!' kind of smacks it right in its face plate. Now it is time for the creatures that are still behind Fikkara. As they sort of shimmer and skitter and sort of readjust their form, they come back at you as a triangle once again.
Sarah 30:43
Ahhh.
Brian 30:45
The first attack will miss with a seven.
Sarah 30:48
Yay.
Brian 30:48
The second attack will connect with a 17.
Sarah 30:52
Okay.
Brian 30:52
And the third attack will connect with a 19.
Sarah 30:55
Okay.
Brian 30:57
You will take a total of 13 piercing damage.
Sarah 31:00
Okay.
Brian 31:00
From two separate attacks.
Ned 31:02
Brutal.
Brian 31:03
So they skitter and shift and you can feel that the three of them are working together to kind of feint and to get you to commit to different sides to create, create openings as the sort of jagged bone spears keep piercing down from the ceiling, stabbing you in the clavicle. Zenia.
Landree 31:20
Zenia, as infatuated as this Vedalken can ever really can be with someone so in tune with the Earth and worms completely enchanted by Lorzatch's phenomenal murder of this creature, gives him with her googly violet eyes: her Inspiration. She then moves-
Brian 31:48
So Andrew, you now have a point of Inspiration you can use at your discretion.
Landree 31:52
Not incredibly nimble, Zenia sidles up next to Lennox and she rubs her hands together and she rubs them on her pants and she holds her fingers slightly apart and forms a fireball and casts it at the Death Priest. And-
Brian 32:09
Did you just cast Fireball or are you-
Landree 32:12
Firebolt.
Brian 32:12
Firebolt. Okay.
Ned 32:14
Firebolt. Oh shit!
Brian 32:15
Because, because everyone around you-
Ned 32:18
Everyone would've died!
Brian 32:19
No, it's not it's not that much damage but it is a radial attack. So you cast Firebolt. Thank you very much.
Landree 32:25
Terrible diction. I apologize to everyone. She, Zenia casts Firebolt-
Brian 32:33
Thank you.
Landree 32:34
At the Death Priest andthis little ball of static electricity fire just fizzles out.
Brian 32:40
Oh, with a miss.
Landree 32:41
With a miss.
Brian 32:42
Rough. Okay, back to the top. Ooh. You're dead.
Andrew 32:47
A watery grave yet again.
Ned 32:52
Yay Parax.
Brian 32:52
Um, okay for those of you at home I just dropped Ned's-
Ned 32:56
Place marker?
Brian 32:56
- initiative slot into my coffee. So Ned Donovan has received yet another watery grave in this game. But-
Ned 33:04
Well, fuckyour game.
Brian 33:05
Top of the order. Top of the order. Yes and you failed Athletic checks for swimming underwater-
Ned 33:09
That's true.
Brian 33:10
-so that counterbalance work. It's top of the order. It is your turn to attack again.
Ned 33:15
So, I am also not the most nimble and I am horrified of whatever is attacking Fikarra.
Brian 33:20
And not only that, but this swarm seems to be rather coordinated and you guys seem to be struggling slightly.
Ned 33:25
Yeah. So Parax stands up and immediately moves past Zenia to the space just beyond her, which I believe is my max move given my current situation.
Brian 33:34
You will receive an attack of opportunity-
Ned 33:36
I'm aware.
Brian 33:37
-from the creature above you.
Ned 33:38
Yeah.
Brian 33:38
It also will have, uhh, actually it is not next to another Kraul so it will not receive advantage on that attack. It will roll a six.
Ned 33:47
Great.
Sarah 33:49
That's awesome.
Brian 33:50
So, as, as this Kraul is sort of focused on Fikkara and it, it sees kind of out of the corner of one of its, I don't know how many, eyes that there's a shift and it kind of quickly just tries to pop you with the backend of it spear but you move safely out of distance
Ned 34:04
Okay and then, ah, the crystal in my hand grows that same deep purple from the last encounter and a bolt fills in my hand and fires straight at the Death Priest for Witchbolt.
Brian 34:15
Okay.
Ned 34:18
Tell me a natural 20 plus five hits.
Brian 34:20
Well, I'm gonna say yeah. I'm gonna say yeah.
Ned 34:24
What happens for damage in this edition?
Brian 34:26
You get an additional damage dice.
Andrew 34:27
So you roll one d12-
Brian 34:28
Die, excuse me. Die is the singular.
Ned 34:30
Yes.
Brian 34:31
Dice is the plural.
Ned 34:35
That would be 21 points of damage.
Brian 34:38
21 points of damage.
Ned 34:40
Which is not great on a 3d 12.
Brian 34:42
Well, it's a severe smash. Well yeah, anything above an 18 is good. Described this spell to me a little bit more clearly so I can see what's going on.
Ned 34:50
So Witchbolt is a, is a lancing arc of energy that comes straight out of my hand and fires into the heart of the Death Priest which causes this same person purple aura to appear around it but only to me as I am now tethered into its very core.
Brian 34:58
Whoa. Freaky. A severe amount of damage, but the Death Priest seems to stare at you with this sort of blank insectile face with sort of Voodoo skull painted on it and it knows exactly what it is you just did and seems very perturbed. In fact on its turn, the first thing that it does is shifts slightly around the base.
Andrew 35:30
Or does it take a Constitution saving throw?
Brian 35:39
What type, what type of damage is it?
Andrew 35:41
Necrotic.
Brian 35:42
Necrotic. So it will roll a 16-
Andrew 35:47
It saves.
Brian 35:48
-for saving throw and we'll say that's all that happens as far as that. It will shift five feet to the right as it sort of dances around trying to keep at least a single line with that Spiritual Weapon and Lorzatch, seeing if there's a way that it can sort of protect itself around. What you see is one of its many arms reach down to the dead corpse of the insect warrior that you defeated earlier.
Ned 36:11
Not gonna be great.
Brian 36:12
And it simply just picks it up and just, while it's focusing a separate spell, just, just starts gnawing on it and consuming some of this dead warrior.
Sarah 36:23
Ew.
Ned 36:23
That's horrifying.
Eddie 36:25
Probably healing itself.
Ned 36:26
I don't need you to say that out loud.
Landree 36:27
Reduce.
Ned 36:29
I don't need that kind of fear in my life.
Landree 36:31
Reduce, recycle, reuse.
Andrew 36:35
That's, that is what the guild is all about.
Sarah 36:38
Earth friendly.
Ned 36:39
You guys also run the Appalachian Trail.
Brian 36:42
Oh.
Ned 36:43
Sorry.
Brian 36:44
So after picking up this body and gnawing on it, it seems like it's focusing a spell and just skitters forward scarily towards Lorzatch and reaches out this hand towards you. One of its four hands. And it will roll double 17 on advantage so a 21 to hit.
Andrew 37:02
It hits.
Brian 37:02
You feel this horrific pull of your soul out of your body and immediately know that you are being drained and you will take eight points of necrotic damage. And by the consumption and this vampiric touch, this Death Priest that has just received some of your damage seems to stand back up a little taller with a bit of audacity.
Ned 37:27
Motherfuck.
Brian 37:28
Fikkara.
Sarah 37:28
Was incredibly unpleasant. I'm going to cast Second Wind.
Brian 37:34
Okay.
Sarah 37:34
So that will be...where did the thing that I-
Brian 37:37
Idon't know. Max.
Sarah 37:38
Hopefully, that would be lovely. All right, not bad.
Brian 37:41
Not max.
Sarah 37:42
Not max, but not bad.
Brian 37:45
Fist bump for the DM.
Sarah 37:46
Whoo!
Brian 37:51
Up until that roll, I'm not kidding, I've been telling for the entire campaign: every time you guys have rolled healing dice to regain hit points, you have rolled the max number on the die.
Sarah 38:00
It's cuz we're kind of awesome.
Brian 38:02
Until now.
Sarah 38:03
Right. You're welcome everybody. So then I will go ahead and mace the one that I have already maced. I will go ahead and strike him again be like, 'Get over here.' Smash the bug. See if that works. It's going to be an 11 which is sad.
Brian 38:20
An 11 will not hit.
Sarah 38:22
Okay.
Brian 38:22
They're just dodging too much. It's too-
Sarah 38:24
Right.
Brian 38:25
-coordinated. It's too much shifting. It's too much skittering. It's really hard to to sort of land one solid slack.
Sarah 38:31
Right, right. And I will also do Action Surge to hit again.
Brian 38:36
Okay.
Sarah 38:37
With a 23.
Brian 38:39
A 23 will hit.
Sarah 38:40
Right. Okay, come on. Let's finish this bastard off with a six.
Brian 38:45
Six damage.
Sarah 38:47
Or seven, I'm sorry, seven.
Brian 38:48
Seven damage. It looks really worn out, like, 'why am I the only one out of the three of us that is continuing to get attacked by this lady? Ow.' And it's skittering just a little bit less easily and a little bit less coordinated.
Sarah 39:03
Okay.
Brian 39:03
Lorzatch, you are up.
Andrew 39:04
Lorzatch holds aloft the flaming scimitar and brings it crashing down upon the form of the Kraul Death Priest. Does a 24 hit?
Brian 39:15
A 24 does hit.
Andrew 39:17
And a 16 does not?
Brian 39:18
A 16 does not hit. Mother. Pause while Lorzatch counts the, like, 12 dice of damage that he rolled.
Andrew 39:29
22 damage.
Brian 39:30
22 damage.
Landree 39:31
Yes.
Brian 39:31
Now make no mistake: this is a very large Kraul. And though you chip away at it and chunk away at it, there is visible damage as your scimitar slices and the fire burns. Neither of these things do insects like, but this is a Death Priest and you know from experience that these things don't drop easily and when they go down they go down vengefully.
It is now the creatures around the Death Priest turn to chip in. One of them is going to, again, fire an arrow at you Lorzatch.
Andrew 40:02
Which one?
Brian 40:03
The one in the back that it- one of them is next to you that is now switched to a spear. The other one that has been firing arrows continuously is going to shoot another arrow at you. Does a 22 hit?
Andrew 40:12
It does.
Brian 40:13
You will take four piercing damage. And then the one next to the Death Priest seems a little bit more invigorated that its leader is rocking next to it, but I guess it's going to make a Constitution saving throw. Does a 13 work?
Andrew 40:28
It meets the save.
Brian 40:29
It meets the save.
Andrew 40:30
Does that go to the-
Ned 40:31
Yes.
Andrew 40:31
Great.
Brian 40:32
Tie goes to the roller. However it is going to attack you with its spear. Does a 17 hit?
Andrew 40:37
It does.
A 17 hits. You will take another five piercing damage. So the fact that this Death Priest has been taking this damage and surviving and nobody seems concerned with the fact that it's now eating some of its members and it's touching the opponents; the Kraul feel like they're winning and feel a little bit more invigored to fight back just that little bit extra. Lennox.
Eddie 40:58
Lennox's Spiritual Weapon attacks the Death Priest. Rolling a 14 plus 5. 19.
Brian 41:05
A 19 will hit. Roll damage please.
Ned 41:09
Yes, Lennox!
Eddie 41:11
Agh, that's eight points of damage.
Brian 41:12
Eight points of damage. Out of curiosity, what kind of damage is this weapon throwing-
Eddie 41:16
Force damage.
Brian 41:17
Force damage.Okay.
Eddie 41:18
Uh. That was his bonus action.
Brian 41:21
Okay.
Eddie 41:21
Then he steps up and touches his spore-wielding friend and grants him Heroeism, Heroism Heroeism, whatever. Now you have Bravery: you cannot be Frightened and you have plus five temporary points and you get to attack.
Andrew 41:40
Immediately?
Eddie 41:41
Immediately.
Brian 41:42
You get to free attack action right now.
Ned 41:43
Love that.
Brian 41:44
You see the-
Ned 41:45
I love that you looked at your damage and were like, 'he hits harder.' I love that.
Brian 41:48
So Lennox, you run up and you give this heroic inspiration to your spore-wielding friend. And Lorzatch sort of re-cocks his sword behind his shoulder and you see the Death Priest, sort of, very confusedly go, 'Oh, what the frickin Hell is about to happen?'
Andrew 42:05
And Lorzatch will use his inspiration.
Brian 42:08
Oh no.
Andrew 42:09
And will miss if a 14 does not hit.
Brian 42:15
The disappointment as you hear this insectile '(chittering laugh)'
Andrew 42:22
Damn, that's disappointing.
Brian 42:23
Fikkara.
Sarah 42:23
Yes.
Brian 42:24
You are still being assaulted by these three warriors since your friends have abandon you to go deal with the rather cool looking miniature on the table. Is that, 'who are those Kraul warriors in the back on the ceiling? Forget that.' So you are being attacked again in the same manner. They are just dead set that if the three of them work together eventually they can bring down the cow.
Sarah 42:46
Right.
Brian 42:47
The first attack is a 17. The second attack is also a 17. And the third attack is also a 17. 3 14s.
Ned 42:58
Feels bad.
Sarah 42:58
You're not my favorite right now.
Brian 43:00
Well, I'm not really anybody's favorite because I'm the Dungeon Master.
Sarah 43:02
I know.
Brian 43:03
You are going to take, it will be 12-
Sarah 43:06
I'm down.
Brian 43:06
-piercing damage.
Ned 43:07
Oh that is bad.
Brian 43:08
So you guys feel the terror as suddenly this radiant rage of a bull behind you suddenly just dissipates and by turning around you see Fikkara down on the tunnel floor.
Ned 43:20
Fuck. Okay.
Brian 43:22
Zenia. It is now your turn.
Landree 43:23
Zenia incredibly frustrated by her spellcasting ability decides to go hard or go home and she cast Chaos Bolt at the Death Priest.
Ned 43:33
For those at home, she blew on the die.
Landree 43:36
And she uses Tides of Chaos and tries to get a better roll.
Brian 43:41
Oh, you are going to need to roll twice. So you have missed your attack. But you did use Tides so I need you to roll it d 100 please, as Wild Magic pours out from you.
Ned 43:53
Ah.
Eddie 43:53
Two.
Sarah 43:54
I believe in you.
Brian 43:55
No, no, she just-yeah, yeah.
Landree 43:57
30. Oh right again. 30.
Brian 44:01
30.
Sarah 44:01
Please be cool. Please be cool. Instant death to all enemies.
Ned 44:05
Chickens. Please be chickens.
Landree 44:06
Zenia is as overwhelmed as she possibly can be with as much emotion as she possibly can be. 'Chickens, chickens, chickens.'
Brian 44:17
You feel a great deal of embarrassment having missed and you feel completely useless like you've disappointed and abandoned your friends. And out of fear out of that overwhelming emotion that you just want to run and hide that you feel right now, you inadvertently teleport 60 feet away from your current position to an unoccupied space you can see. Exactly 60 feet away.
Ned 44:42
You gotta go backwards, I guess.
Cause you can't see around the corner.
Sarah 44:44
Back in the water.
Brian 44:45
Yeah, she can.
Sarah 44:47
She can't see 60 feet.
Landree 44:48
Well, and would I get a full 60 feet? I'm not encumbered of course by the terrain.
Brian 44:52
No, you, you teleport exactly 60 feet somewhere.
Landree 44:56
Thank you.
Andrew 44:58
That kinda works for you right now.
Brian 45:01
That's the thing about Wild Magic. Sometimes it's, people go, 'Oh, something horrible is going to happen', and yes, sometimes it does sometimes really helpful things happen. Sometimes, like, nothing happens.
Ned 45:09
She has teleported behind the bad guy.
Brian 45:12
Yes, so you have teleported yourself farther down into the tunnel but you are now in total darkness. And you can see and hear the battle raging back down the tunnel that you were but for the moment, I, for once again, Zenia has just sort of sauntered off during the combat.
Landree 45:30
She's so easily distracted.
Brian 45:32
Top of the order. Parax.
Ned 45:33
Okay, well I stare at the Death Priest but it seems like there are plenty of people dealing with the Death Priest so I break the Witchbolt and I turn around and run back to Fikarra.
Brian 45:43
Okay.
Ned 45:44
I am then going to, at these three Kraul attackers-
Brian 45:48
Yes.
Ned 45:48
My crystal will glow a light red as my hands begin to boil and I will push that boiling energy directly at all three of them in a 15 foot cone.
Brian 46:02
They all make a save?
Ned 46:03
It is a Dex save of 13.
Sarah 46:06
Can't kill me. Already down.
Eddie 46:08
Well, yeah, he can. But you're down.
Brian 46:10
The two to your left fail, the one to your right does with a 21.
Ned 46:15
Okay, so let's take some, some damage, huh? They are going to receive, what's that math? 16 points of burning damage.
Brian 46:26
Yeah, so that one that Fikkara has been swinging around with wildly has finally taken too much.
Ned 46:32
It's Fire damage technically.
Brian 46:33
Fire is even worse for bugs. With a hideous squeal it just '(bug squeal)' It just sort of plummets down to the earth between you and then does that sort of hideous curling of appendages that happens when an insect dies. The other one next to you has certainly taken the first real major damage and the other two haven't been touched before this particular attack.
So next, the Death Priest. Back again. As it begins its turn within 10 feet of Lorzatch, it will make a Constitution saving throw. It it will have a 21.
Andrew 47:03
Saves.
Brian 47:03
It saves.
Ned 47:06
Save early, save often.
Brian 47:07
Save early, save often. So, it is now becoming increasingly annoyed and you can tell from its mandibles and from its legs that it is sort of skittering back and forth in place in a very irritated fashion. As it transfers it's staff down to its bottom two arms and it's top two arms sort of spread out and throw right at you, Lorzatch, you can see a bunch of Poisonous Spray that comes out of its hands. Please make a Constitution saving throw.
Andrew 47:34
18.
Brian 47:35
An 18 will save yourself. You immediately notice that this is some sort of Poison Spray coming out and you sort of laugh as the Devkarin inside of you is like, 'please,' as you just, your spores just sort of dissipate the mist into a harmless spray. Fikkara, please make a Death saving throw.
Sarah 47:51
Hooray. I got a five.
Brian 47:54
You have one failed save. Lorzatch.
Andrew 47:57
Clutching a flaming blade and a dagger, Lorzatch strikes at the Kraul Death Priest. And does not do well, folks.
Brian 48:07
No, that floating mace in front of your eyes is making it difficult to strike home. It is now the companions of the Death Priest's turn to attack you once again. As the spear coordinates with its master to strike. Does a 12 hit? I suppose not at you, Lorzatch? A 12?
Andrew 48:25
And it does what?
Brian 48:26
Does a 12 hit?
Andrew 48:27
It does not.
Brian 48:28
It does not hit you.
Andrew 48:29
But what else does he need to do?
Brian 48:31
Just say it out loud. It rolls an 11.
Andrew 48:38
And takes four Necrotic damage.
Brian 48:39
Oh, it takes some Necrotic damage. It is looking super poorly. Like super poorly.
Eddie 48:45
The Death Priest?
Brian 48:46
No. So the, the, the Kraul that is next to the Death Priest is sort of coordinating. You notice that these Kraul seem to work together to attack to their advantage. And it sort of sidesteps your mace to throw a spear at Lorzatch,but Lorzatch's spores have finally affected it enough that it kind of throws a cough and it tilts the spear off balance enough that it can't land home with a strike. However, the Kraul that is still in the back fires an arrow. Does a 17 hit?
Andrew 49:12
It does.
Brian 49:14
You will take six piercing damage from its arrow.
Ned 49:17
How you doing Lorzatch?
Andrew 49:18
For the first time, you see what Devkarin blood looks like.
Ned 49:23
Oh, man.
Brian 49:23
Lennox.
Eddie 49:24
Okay. Gotta save the cow.
Ned 49:27
I got her, man. Unless you can do something from there.
Eddie 49:30
I can.
Ned 49:31
Okay, great. That would be very useful to me.
Sarah 49:39
I feel like someone cow tips me every time I go out.
Eddie 49:43
Lennox summons his healing power and utters a Healing Word and throws the energy towards his bovine companion.
Sarah 49:53
Did you really have to use the word utter?
Brian 50:03
Please make your roll.
Ned 50:04
Oh, that's amazing.
Eddie 50:08
Yes. Eight points.
Sarah 50:13
Yay!
Brian 50:14
Max healing is no longer effective.
Eddie 50:17
You broke it.
Brian 50:18
The run is over.
Ned 50:20
Take your own potion. I don't want to pour it down your throat for an action.
Eddie 50:25
Was that not enough to get her up?
Sarah 50:26
Yeah, I'm up, yeah. Thank you so much.
Brian 50:28
Well, you're currently lying on the ground which is good because it is those skittering things around you turn and they think they've already killed you, so, Parax you're about to get two attacks.
Eddie 50:37
Oh, now it's my- Hello, I'm not done yet I'm sorry.
Brian 50:39
Oh, well, pardon me.
Eddie 50:41
I acted like I was like completely done but I was not.
Ned 50:43
You did sit back with your arms folded.
Sarah 50:45
Yeah.
Brian 50:46
You still have a Spectral Weapon.
Eddie 50:48
I was so pleased with myself.
Andrew 50:49
Oh yes.
Brian 50:49
You still have a Spectral Weapon. Please roll attack.
Eddie 50:51
My Spectral Weapon attacks.
Brian 50:54
Target is an 18.
Eddie 50:55
It misses.
Brian 50:55
And it misses. Now, if I may, Parax.
Ned 51:01
I am, uh, yes, go ahead.
Brian 51:03
Yes, receive the tag-team spear action of two insect warriors. The first attack is a 21.
Ned 51:09
Sure.
Brian 51:10
The second attack is a 17.
Ned 51:13
So I-
Brian 51:13
No, I'm sorry. 16.
Ned 51:14
I'm going to cast Shield.
Brian 51:16
As a reaction?
Ned 51:17
As a reaction.
Brian 51:18
Yes.
Ned 51:18
To the 16 because I can't block the 21 no matter what, but I can block this.
Brian 51:20
So you block the second one?
Ned 51:22
Yes.
Brian 51:22
Okay, so you will take four piercing damage from one of the two.
Ned 51:26
Taken.
Brian 51:27
As, as they sort of dance together again up on the walls, one of them feints to the left, throwing your Shield reaction in that direction while another spear kind of catches you in the shoulder.
Ned 51:36
Ah, yes. Ok.
Brian 51:37
Zenia.
Landree 51:38
Zenia. Just feeling so upset and just so embarrassed at how she continues to fail the team reaches deep inside herself and attempts to cast Shatter on this square right here-
Brian 51:55
Got it.
Landree 51:55
-in order to hit home free.
Ned 51:57
Get it, girl.
Brian 51:58
What is the saving throw needed?
Landree 52:00
13.
Brian 52:01
A 13. Charisma?
Landree 52:03
Yes.
Brian 52:04
Well, here's the thing: insect bugs aren't very charismatic. So the two Kraul warriors- one of them actually will save. So the archer will save with a 14. The other one will fail with a nine and then the Death Priest will also fail with an eight. So what did, what happens?
Landree 52:25
I'd like to spend one Sorcery point to roll additional damage on the Death Priest, but each creature takes three points of, or 3d8s of damage. That's 17 points of damage on the Death Priest so far.
Brian 52:41
So the Death Priest and the one who failed will take 17?
Landree 52:44
Both of them, yes. Okay.
Brian 52:45
And then the one who saved takes half.
Landree 52:49
Mhm.
Brian 52:49
So it will take 12?
Ned 52:52
Doesn't it round, does it round up or down?
Brian 52:54
I think it runs down but there's also the initial damage of sha-
Andrew 52:56
So-
Brian 52:56
-the initial damage of Shatter, which it takes. So it's Shatter plus the 3d8-
Ned 53:00
Got it.
Brian 53:01
-rounded down is half- is a 13, then to 12.
Andrew 53:04
Yeah.
Brian 53:05
Wow. OK, so the Kraul warrior that is up at the front. None of them are even aware that you are behind it and suddenly it can just feel its whole exoskeleton structure just shatter.
Ned 53:17
Oh.
Brian 53:17
And it's back sort of arcs in this horrible crack as it just sort of crumbles in an unnatural shape to the ground. The archer Kraul that is still in front of you is now angrily aware that you are behind it and the Death Priest, again, sort of twists herself in a slight manner as now she's aware that the attacks are coming from multiple directions.
Landree 53:38
And Zenia, feeling finally empowered by this action and being able to help her friends, releases the rest of this thunderous rage at the Death Priest for an additional 17 points of damage.
Brian 53:53
Oh, and this is what?
Landree 53:55
This was my Empowered spell.
Brian 53:56
Oh, wow. Okay, yes. Ooh.
Ned 53:59
I like to imagine that's what the Death Priest said.
Brian 54:02
Oh.
Andrew 54:06
Oh! My phalanges!
Brian 54:10
My thorax!
So yeah, so somehow, somehow Zenia's shame has turned into a flank and just unleashed this super power of damage out from down the tunnel. You guys hear this crack and this rip of power and where you had assumed that Zenia had just sort of abandoned you once again you now realize, no, she is leading the charge. Top of the order: Parax.
Ned 54:35
Oh, hey. So, uh, of these two guys around me; which are damaged?
Brian 54:40
So the one- I know you're kind of facing the opposite way, but you as a character-
Ned 54:45
Yeah, yeah, looking at my mini-
Brian 54:46
Looking at your mini to the left, that one has been damaged and looks bloody. The one to the right has not been touched.
Ned 54:51
Great. So I'm pointing at the bloodied and damaged one.
Brian 54:54
Okay.
Ned 54:54
And the crystal suddenly glows black and the room seems to darken just a little bit as this ominous, barely audible bell tolls through the room and I Toll the Dead on that motherfucker.
Brian 55:09
Oh shit.
Ned 55:09
It needs a Wisdom saving throw of 13
Brian 55:12
A three.
Ned 55:14
Great talk, everybody.
Eddie 55:15
Come on, cantrips.
Ned 55:16
It's gon' take, straight up- What's the math here? Is there extra math? Oh, there is no extra math. I'm so sorry. It's a seven.
Brian 55:24
It's a seven.
Ned 55:24
Seven points of Necrotic damage.
Brian 55:26
Seven points of Necrotic damage. It drops from the ceiling. It is not dead, no, I apologize. Yes, it is. Seven. It just drops dead. No pomp, no ceremony, no fun articulation. It just Toll of the Dead here one minute, gone with the snap of a finger.
Ned 55:43
I gotta move to cantrips because I need that Shield spellslot.
Brian 55:46
The, the Death Priest, seeing the danger that it's in as its warriors are dropping one by one. She wants again reaches down and grabs the dead Kraul warrior next to her and begins chewing on it, revitalizing herself. Take it max heal damage, player.
Landree 56:05
Yes.
Brian 56:10
And then-
Eddie 56:11
I rebuke that in the name of Jesus.
Brian 56:12
She starts to break out her more desperate attacks. Lorzatch. Would you please make a Constitution saving throw as a literal blight emanates from her mouth.
Andrew 56:23
'(deep sigh)' 19.
Brian 56:27
A 19 is good, because those of you who don't know what blight does-
Ned 56:31
It's not great.
Brian 56:32
It does 8d8 damage. Half on a saved throw. So, that is 10, 16- I'm just doing math out loud. That's another 16 and another 13. So, 32 and so...47 divided by two rounded down is 23 Necrotic damage. So this anger, insult, pain, and just absolute disgust as this '(whooshing sound)' just pours out of the Death Priest's mouth and hugs the floor before rising up into your lungs. And Lorzatch, you see him just sort of cringe up his eyes up into his head in this tightness and then just drop to the ground.
Ned 57:19
Did we just double damage your character?
Brian 57:21
No.
Andrew 57:21
No.
Ned 57:21
Oh, God. I was like, 'oh shit!'
Brian 57:23
No.
Andrew 57:23
But he is not great.
Brian 57:25
No. But that would have been 47 points of damage if he'd failed the Constitution saving throw.
Ned 57:31
Would've one dropped you?
Andrew 57:32
It would have been very close to dropping me. Yeah.
Brian 57:36
But for now he is not dead. Fikkara.
Ned 57:39
Neither is Fikkara!
Sarah 57:41
Yay! Not dead. Can I reach the-
Brian 57:45
Well, number one you're on the ground.
Sarah 57:46
Right, I was just gonna ask you if-
Brian 57:48
Can you reach the ceiling from laying down on the ground? No.
Eddie 57:50
'Fikkara. We need some healing potion.'
Sarah 57:52
'That was the thing so,' and I can bonus action to take a healing potion?
Brian 57:56
You can manipulate an object. Yes.
Sarah 57:58
Okay. Then I will take a healing potion.
Brian 58:00
So you can manipulate for free. So pop it, drink as a bonus action, receive the healing that the healing potion will give you.
Ned 58:07
Does the healing potion give you?
Brian 58:08
A potion gives you 2d4 plus two.
Sarah 58:10
Okay. Cool.
Ned 58:11
Great.
Sarah 58:12
That's not bad. That's pretty good.
Brian 58:13
For the for the general portion of healing.
Ned 58:15
Cool.
Sarah 58:16
Right? That's not, that's not bad. Oh, where did the other go? Oh, there it went.
Brian 58:21
So one and one and two.
Andrew 58:23
Yeah.
Brian 58:23
So four.
Ned 58:24
Four points.
Sarah 58:25
Four.
Brian 58:25
The lowest possible amount you can get.
Ned 58:27
We've, we've pendulumed pretty badly.
Brian 58:29
I have stolen your luck and have max healed my monster.
Sarah 58:33
Okay, so I'm up. Took a bonus action.
Brian 58:36
Yes.
Sarah 58:36
I am just like, you didn't know that Minotaurs could growl but it's like this '(mooing growl)' And just rage out and hit as hard as I can, like dangle a little adorable Minotaur leap to hit the Kraul that's like on the ceiling.
Brian 58:55
Yeah.
Ned 58:55
I like to imagine you just served it like a tennis ball.
Sarah 58:58
That's exactly what I was thinking of! And that is-
Ned 59:03
Yasss!
Sarah 59:03
Yeah.
Andrew 59:03
Oh my God.
Sarah 59:04
That's gonna be a 24
Brian 59:05
Oh yes.
Landree 59:06
Yes.
Brian 59:07
Oh, yes. Now this Kraul has not taken any damage but it is now realizing that it has no companions to help it.
Sarah 59:14
Yeah, and it's going to take eight damage please.
Brian 59:16
It's going to take eight damage.
Sarah 59:18
Yes.
Brian 59:18
Roger. Okay, Lorzatch, would you please make a death saving throw? You have one fail.
The one Kraul warrior that now sees that you are behind it, Zenia, turns around very rapidly and tries to launch an arrow in your direction out of desperation. Does a 15 connect?
Landree 59:36
Yes.
Brian 59:36
Yes it does. I know we're making a sad face but I'm questioning whether or not you've actually ever taken damage so far in this campaign. Have you actually been damaged yet? We have a first-
Landree 59:46
No.
Brian 59:47
We have a first this week, ladies and gentlemen.
Ned 59:50
I don't know the math yet but it's around the two and a half-
Brian 59:52
You know what? For the first time in the campaign, I'm breaking out the 'fuck you' d6.
Landree 59:57
Oh no!
Brian 59:59
You are going to take six points of piercing damage.
Landree 1:00:01
That's fair.
Ned 1:00:03
You have, like, a dead character, a bovine who drops-
Brian 1:00:06
Two people have dropped in, somebody died, Zenia takes her first six points. I've been deserving this for awhile.
Ned 1:00:13
I accept my punishment.
Brian 1:00:17
Lennox, you're up my man.
Eddie 1:00:18
My spiritual mace attacks.
Unknown Speaker 1:00:22
Yeah, spiritual man, that's not what I saw.
Eddie 1:00:24
Does not hit.
Brian 1:00:24
No.
Eddie 1:00:25
And I cure my fallen companion of his wounds for-
Sarah 1:00:30
No whammy, no whammy.
Brian 1:00:33
Crap. Which is?
Eddie 1:00:37
11 points.
Brian 1:00:38
As the cleric, as the cleric steals the power back from the Dungeon Master and rises Lorzatch from the floor. 'Welcome to the party, pal.' That one Kraul warrior that is stuck back with now Parax and Fikkara is going, 'Wait, this was a three-on-one that's now a one-on-two. I'm really not happy with the situation.' So he is going to make a desperate attacked back at Fikkara.
Sarah 1:01:02
Oh, I'm like, 'tell me he's gonna run.
Brian 1:01:05
That's gonna be a 14.
Sarah 1:01:06
Suck it. No.
Brian 1:01:07
What is your armor class?
Sarah 1:01:09
16.
Brian 1:01:09
Right, so 14 does not hit.
Andrew 1:01:11
It doesn't-
Sarah 1:01:12
That's why I said 'suck it.'
Brian 1:01:16
People get mad at DMs for various reasons.
Sarah 1:01:19
True.
Brian 1:01:19
It's difficult when, when ,when curses are thrown our way, we're just trying to establish what exactly we're cursing about. It then is, rather boldly and desperately, going to move away from you and I'm not realizing I could have just taken a disengage action and run away but I didn't. So it is coming to flail and then back up providing an opportunity of attack for both of you.
That would be one of those but since you wrote a one or a two I'm going to assume that you just-
Sarah 1:01:53
I miss.
Andrew 1:01:53
She still has advantage.
Sarah 1:01:54
Yeah, that's why-
Brian 1:01:55
Oh.
Andrew 1:01:55
Bull strength.
Brian 1:01:57
Thank you for clarifying for the audience. Would you like to use the one or the two?
Sarah 1:02:02
I'll use the two please.
Brian 1:02:04
A two misses.
Ned 1:02:06
I'm assuming a nine misses.
Brian 1:02:07
You're assuming a nine misses. You are correct. A nine misses. But what it will do is it will skitter all the way around the wall til it is in a space next to its Death Priest but still far enough away that it won't need to make a Constitution saving throw from the spores and if that means moving past the priest it will move past the priest.
Ned 1:02:28
Does it have that kind of range?
Brian 1:02:30
No, around the wall, just around to the back side of her. It can climb over on the wall. Keep going around, keep going around the area.There you go.
Andrew 1:02:36
Ok. I'm gonna let this slide but it's like definitely crosses within a radius of 10 feet but-
Eddie 1:02:42
But it has to start the-
Ned 1:02:43
It's also 10 or 11 squares. Does it have a movement of that much?
Brian 1:02:46
Oh yeah.
Sarah 1:02:46
Yeah.
Ned 1:02:47
Okay.
Sarah 1:02:48
Oh.
Brian 1:02:50
No, we can do it. We- make it- that's okay, we can clarify this. If it enters your space, it takes it as well? Or if it moves through?
Andrew 1:02:55
If it enters that space and yeah.
Brian 1:02:57
Okay, that's fine. We'll have it make it. That's fine. A seven.
Andrew 1:03:02
Takes four Necrotic damage.
Brian 1:03:04
Well, I'm gonna pay for being considerate about that, aren't I? Yeah, so it takes, it takes some more Necrotic damage. It seems to have very desperately allowed itself to have three sources of damage coming at it as it as a sort of panicky skitters back to the safety of the Death Priest. Zenia.
Landree 1:03:22
Zenia, feeling so tickled that something is finally working, goes back to Shatter and casts it again, right in the center of these three guys.
Brian 1:03:31
Okay, and the DC saving throw is what?
Landree 1:03:33
13.
Brian 1:03:34
So, the archer fails. The spearman scores a 12.
Landree 1:03:39
Yeah.
Brian 1:03:39
So the 12 fails.
Landree 1:03:40
It fails.
Brian 1:03:40
And the priestess also fails with a five.
Landree 1:03:43
Fantastic. 14. Total.
Brian 1:03:49
You just roll ones for?
Landree 1:03:51
I'm going to do it- I'm going to spend the Sorcery.
Brian 1:03:52
And the Sorcery point. Sure.
Landree 1:03:55
And this is for the Death Priest. Another 10.
Brian 1:04:00
Okay, so would you please describe how in a single spell you obliterate all of the remaining warriors? As as this one Kraul warrior made such a desperate act to find its way back to its master either to defend or die as a snack, fueling the Kraul machine and instead just becomes a conduit for a massive spell shattering.
Landree 1:04:30
So Zenia reaches deep within, deep within herself, and she plants this ringing in the center of each one of these creatures. This thunderous rain that starts as this little pulse and grows and grows and grows into this giant thunderclap. And all of their ears bleed and they dropp to the ground, and she laughs maniacally.
Eddie 1:05:03
Huzzah!
Brian 1:05:04
So, as the battle fury subsides, and the cold darkness of the Undercity envelops you once again, the danger of the Golgari becomes an unsettling reality. Though vision is limited, you can definitely feel the pain coursing through Lorzatch as he lingers among the dead, perhaps feeling the same pain that Parax felt deep within the Zonot. As the tragedies mount, there is still but one direction and so you trudge off farther into darkness.
On the next Encounter Party! Lorzatch faces a harsh reality as the manipulations of Malfus Reid stretch beyond what anyone could have imagined. As Zenia's plan takes its turn, our players face a danger they could have been never planned for. Where has the power been running to? Snd will they finally identify this mysterious orb? Find out next time on Encounter Party!

Last time on Encounter Party! A fight breaks out in the penthouse of Mr. Alfonso the Third as our players rush to save him from the diabolical Dimir Guild. As the machinations of House Dimir begin to unravel, the mystery of Malfus Reid grows ever deeper. Was he another pawn of the Guild of Secrets? Or has he been using them for his own nefarious ends? What secret project was Malfus Reid working on? And can our players escape the quarantine to investigate? Find out this week on Encounter Party!
Alrighty, nothing makes more work for a Dungeon Master than splitting the party. So, thank you very much for that.
The carnage from last night has revealed a few unsettling things. The elf concierges from downstairs were corrupted in the same manner as Mr. Alfonso's security team was. Also, the other two Dimir agents have a strange physiology that at least four of you have never seen before.
Parax and Lorzatch have agreed to transport the bodies back to Zonet 4, hoping that the Simic doctors there might be able to discern the difference between these elves and the orb's corruption because they are two different things now.
As for the rest of you, you have an appointment to keep with Malfus Reid's second researcher. So Zenia, Fikkara, and Lennox, you guys will make your way over to the Izzet Research Laboratory.
As you enter the front hallway, you see the same elderly, disgruntled goblin who's working behind the counter. She confirms your appointment with a bit of a huff and admits you inside.
Now if you thought the pump station was loud, you are not prepared for the inner workings of an Izzet Research Laboratory. Your body is literally pulled in different directions because there is like a static electricity generator on your left. And then like belching valves of hot and cold steam on your right, that are just sort of warbling away. An administrator will come down and greet you on the lower catwalk and she will lead you through this maze of piping and steam and glass tubes and heat and cold and shock and sound and just vibration with every step.
It's like all known areas of physics are just swirling around inside of this building. Without any sort of choreography. For example: you pass by a human male on your right who seems to be calibrating some kind of small gauge on one of the pipes. And as you pass by him, he will take notice of you. But when he turns you can see that, like half of his face is just severely scarred from some type of burning accident, perhaps from steam itself.
Further down, as you guys are traversing inside the lab, you will hear this very loud pop. And then a weird flash of light will arc from around the corner. And after a moment, you see this grizzled, raggedy man just come rushing towards you and basically tackling this administrator, just like pelting her with questions with this, 'What year is it? What year is it?!' And after after she just kind of very politely tells him what year it is he starts to lose his mind even more with just, 'No!. Too far back! I've come to fall back! You have to warn everyone in 300 years for bees! THE BEES!' And then he just he just goes rushing off down the corridor.
And then like 20 paces later, you hear the same pop. And you see the same flash of light. And then the same guy comes running around the quarter in front of you. He looks similar but somehow different. And again just rushes up to you with, 'Have you seen anyone around here who looks like me? Yes, I know. I know. But I have to warn him. It's not the bees. It's the flowers! Oh God, the flowers were behind everything!' And then he just goes rushing off down the corridor. And this kind of thing just sort of passes for normal around here.
Ned 4:43
I'd like to investigate the bees, fuck whatever story we're in.
Eddie 4:47
I've had enough of this tomfoolery.
Brian 4:49
It's 300 years in the future. Doesn't matter.
So eventually, after about a 10 minute walk you are led to the top floor of this complex. Now, folks at the top floor of an Izzet lab or not very nice people. Their time is invaluable to them so nobody's even going to give you a first look.
You are led into an important looking office that is cleverly bathed in blue and red light bulbs for whatever reason. There are comfortable places for you to sit down and wait. One of the cool things about Izzet design is this sort of Renaissance chic. It's like, like a mix between steampunk and Art Nouveau that kind of inspires their fabrics. So there's just, you know, the room is just blue and red and occasionally some yellow.
You don't have to wait long for whoever you're supposed to meet to come back. She, she kind of just walks in without even acknowledging you. She has a clipboard in her hand and she's awkwardly shifting back and forth between the light from these bulbs and Zeni- Zenia you can pretty quickly ascertain that whatever it is she's, she's reading the text would be revealed by different colors of lights. So she has this sort of awkward waltz and she's trying to finish reading what's in front of her before she actually takes a seat at her desk.
She doesn't look up at you. She just kind of raises one eyebrow and asks what could possibly be so important that she needs to waste her time for it?
Eddie 6:17
'Are you Malfus Reid's assistant?'
Brian 6:20
She looks, she finally kind of looks up to you and she says, 'I am the second researcher.' She is a woman of dark skin.
Eddie 6:27
Oh, she black? I say, 'What's up, sister?'
Brian 6:27
But wait, what you can see over the top of her skin is actually even darker, almost scorch marks, sort of like a Looney Tunes explosion that kind of hits her face, but perhaps it's happened so many times that every exposed piece of her skin just sort of has these weird like residual blast marks. Her fro is thrown back in a way that isn't necessarily stylized. Perhaps just the front of it has been burned off so many times it doesn't really grow anymore. She has the attitude of a woman who is much smarter than you would ever know or even admit and the fact that you threw the word 'assistant' at her does not start off your meeting in a good light.
She says, 'My name is Lufola Senn. I am the second researcher here. I am no one's ""assistant.""'
Eddie 7:19
'My apologies, madam Senn. Please forgive my ignorance. We are here to ask you questions about your colleague.'
Brian 7:26
'Yes. Somebody said that I had to pay attention to Malfus Reid for the fourth time today.'
Eddie 7:32
'Malfus Reid is dead.'
Brian 7:33
She takes a second to kind of read your faces, not even wondering if you're lying. And then she just kind of laughs. 'Please, oh, how did it happen?'
Eddie 7:46
'He was dismembered.'
Sarah 7:48
'Murder Circus.'
Brian 7:49
'A Rakdos Murder Circus.'
'Oh, I hope it hurt.'
Eddie 7:57
'I'm sure it did.'
Brian 7:58
Now one of the things that you, Zenia, would know is that there's not a lot of love lost between people in the Izzet. A lot of people stand in a lot of people's ways. And it's very clear that the way that she interpreted the term 'assistant' and kind of bitterly says 'second researcher' that she really is not a really big fan. And she goes, 'So, Malfus Reid is dead. Oh, this is the best news I've heard in a long time. So now, what do you want me to do about it?'
Eddie 8:25
'He stole an object. We were wondering if you could shed any light on why?'
Brian 8:31
She says, 'Well, if you're talking about stealing, this is that Izzet.' And she kind of looks at you, Zenia, and she says, 'Nobody steals. People just discover.'
Eddie 8:41
'I'm going to have to disagree with you on that.'
Brian 8:44
She kind of, um-
Eddie 8:46
'That's not how the Law works.'
Brian 8:48
Yeah, she, she kind of, um, she suddenly starts to get maybe a little bit serious at you, Eddie. And she kind of says, 'Is this? Is this an official investigation?'
Eddie 8:57
'Yes.' I show her my badge.
Brian 8:59
Yeah. And she kind of looks at you Zenia and says, 'Is she in your custody?'
Landree 9:04
'Oh, no. No, I'm just alone.'
Eddie 9:07
'These are my companions. They are here on official business with me.'
Brian 9:10
So, she kind of, like, puts down this clipboard that she's been looking at in between conversations and now decides that whatever this is, perhaps, uh, this needs to be her primary focus. And she isn't necessarily nervous. She's just calculating and you can see her eyes kind of continually looking for more data and more information.
'I hope by you being here that you understand I had nothing to do with this. I have not seen Malfus Reid for days.'
Eddie 9:35
'You are not a suspect as of yet.'
'So if the Rakdos killed him in some sort of crazy festival, A: What a moron. I don't know what he's wasting his time there for in the second place. And B: you already know who murdered him. So what is the problem?'
'We are not here to find out who murdered him. We are here to find out what this item is that he stole, and why. We believe that this orb is connected to a series of incidents where people were transformed into ravenous beasts committing atrocities. We also believe it is linked to a hideous monster that has unspeakable power and we want to know why he was involved.'
Brian 10:24
'Whatever Malfus Reid was involved in has nothing to do with me and I don't know. He didn't even want this job to begin with. All I know is Malfus Reid, before he came to this compound, was working on some big project with massive funding that was approved years ago by the Firemind. That research was halted for whatever reason and I know he was mad about it because he'd grumble about it into his brew every day. And when the former master researcher of this particular plant retired, it was expected that I would have the job. But out of nowhere this asshole Malfus Reid marches in here, the Firemind hand gave him this job by one request, and he doesn't even do what he's supposed to be doing. I have been running this facility for three years. Malfus Reid has not done a damn thing. 'Master researcher' my ass! The only thing that I see he does is he disappears every once in a while down to the power grid and just sits there staring at it like some sort of catatonic imp. And now, apparently, he disappeared, snuck out of the research facility for God knows what, but then got his body ripped up by a Rakdos circus freak.'
Sarah 11:38
'That was more very clean slices. But yes.'
Brian 11:41
'Oh, well, that's a pity because I was kind of hoping it would hurt.'
Sarah 11:45
'Oh, I'm sure it was not pleasant. He was alive when it happened.'
Brian 11:48
'Great. My job has not changed. My responsibilities have not changed. I just think it would be appropriate if I would be given the title that I actually hold here.'
Sarah 11:58
'Well, Madam Researcher, Meta-Master Mistress Researcher?'
Brian 12:02
She kind of looks to the Azorius and then looks to the Izzet as this sort of like, ""Oh Christ, a Boros goon.' She goes, 'If you want to take some time to formulate the words that you should have known since kindergarten, I certainly have all the time in the world to wait for you.'
Landree 12:19
Burn.
Sarah 12:19
'Do you have access to his office?'
Brian 12:22
'No.'
Sarah 12:22
'Safe access?'
Brian 12:24
'He did not hold an office. This is the Master Researcher's office. And as you can see, I am here and my stuff is here. And I run the show. I'm telling you, for whatever reason Malfus Reid asked the Firemind directly to be given this post and then didn't do the job.'
Eddie 12:45
'What was he doing?'
Brian 12:47
'I don't know. He wasn't doing anything. The only thing that I know that he was doing was that he would constantly go down for hours at a time and just sit in front the power display array.'
Landree 13:02
'Can you tell us a little more about the power display array?'
Brian 13:04
She says, 'Yeah, we can go take a look if you want to take a look.'
Landree 13:08
'That will be fantastic. Thank you.'
Brian 13:11
'Okay.' So, she is going to lead you guys down to some sort of display array to look at some particular things.
Meanwhile, over at Zonet Number Four. Meanwhile, at the Zonet 4 the Super Friends gather.
Everyone 13:24
'(mimicking Super Friends transition sound)'
Brian 13:27
Lorzatch, Parax carrying these two grotesque bodies of the former Elven twins. Four bodies?
Andrew 13:34
Four bodies.
Brian 13:34
Oh.
Andrew 13:35
Two operatives and two Elves.
Brian 13:36
Take two: Lorzatch and Parax carrying four bodies apiece. I need Strength checks.
Ned 13:41
I was gonna say, could we have gotten help?
Andrew 13:44
I figured we would have fashioned a slip.
Ned 13:46
I was gonna say, can we get help or a cart?
Brian 13:49
So you guys, you guys are just dragging these bodies through the streets, covered.
Ned 13:55
Are they-? They're on a thing and we are taking them.
Brian 13:58
You know I would say-
Ned 13:59
This is also by the way a guild function, so it's not out of the ordinary to see a Golgari dragging bodies.
Yeah, I feel like- and I feel like if a Simic is carrying anything that's humanoid, they're like, ' Yeah, that make sense.'
Brian 14:09
Yeah, I'm gonna say given the state that we are in a Simic slash Izzet research facility nobody's really- this is probably far from the weirdest thing that they've seen.
Ned 14:18
Sure, there was a guy yelling about bees.
Brian 14:22
This morning. So you guys manage- I do need to see some sort of Strength check just for the sake of time.
10?
Andrew 14:32
Five.
Brian 14:33
Oh, okay. It takes you guys a lot longer than you were hoping. You waste, you waste most of the morning going, 'Hey, let's go, let's go 20 yards and stop. Let's take a deep breath, go 20 yards, and stop.' It takes like- part of you are going, 'Man, I really wish we had just brought the Minotaur with us. Why did- when we, when we said, oh let's take four bodies to the Zonnet this morning, did we not go, maybe we should grab the Minotaur.'
Andrew 15:03
'At least one of these is hollow. How could they possibly weigh this much?'
Sarah 15:07
Yeah, who are you missing now mother fuckers?
Brian 15:11
But eventually you do get there. And as you kind of approach within eyesight of the zonnet, there are several sentries out there. They're members of the Simic who can come and assist you. As long as you're willing to let them touch these things.
Andrew 15:23
And Lorzatch which will warn them immediately that one should be basically taken into protective custody before being examined.
Brian 15:31
Ok.
Andrew 15:31
And he'll indicate-
Brian 15:32
Ok.
Ned 15:32
Or restraint of some kind.
Andrew 15:34
Exactly.
Ned 15:34
Yeah.
Andrew 15:34
That there should be a protective security detail surrounding this one because it might just be inert and not deceased.
Brian 15:41
And this is the Dimir agent who still has the plug inside him?
Ned 15:45
Yeah, face smashed in, but has the plug.
Brian 15:46
But has the plug. Okay. So, um, you guys get it in and- and they're still recovering from you know, it's going to be a while before things kind of get back to normal after the, the events in the Zonnet underground, underwater. But you are approached by a couple of people that you remember seeing familiar faces of some doctors and some sentries. Parax, you know these people and you kind of give them information of what's going to happen.
At this point, you guys have developed a certain rapport with the Zonnet that they kind of trust that you know more about what's going on in any particular situation than they do. Zavi approaches and you know, kind of questions what you guys are doing, what they can do for you. You say maybe it's best that you speak to Vezara and Vezara comes in to talk to you guys once again it just says, 'I see we have brought more toys for me to look at. What is it now?'
Andrew 16:38
'Incontrovertible proof of Dimir involvement.'
Brian 16:41
'Oh, there is a fifth. And what have you brought me?' She's not really mad or agitated with you. She's just really tired that yesterday, you know, several days ago, she was probably examining lichin and now she's having to save lives and ruin others.
Ned 16:57
Could we move to a secure room something that can be locked down if needed?
Brian 17:01
With the one you're trying to detain or with all of these or?
Ned 17:04
I would like to not separate anything we're taking.
Brian 17:06
Okay.
Ned 17:07
Like this conversation. I would love everything to be in the custody of these things.
Brian 17:11
She asks what the nature of the visit is, is this like security? Is it medical? Is it-
Ned 17:16
All of the above.
Brian 17:17
All of the above.
Ned 17:17
We have about two different problems. Both of which we need to Simic scientists to look at. But we need to do it in a facility where should there be a contaminant it can be contained. And should our suspicions about one of the bodies be true, we can capture it.
Brian 17:33
Okay, so you, you see her, um. She asks you, Parax, to just quickly assemble a couple sentries that you trust.
Ned 17:41
Great.
Brian 17:41
Or those that you know or think are capable. It's not really a loyalty issue.
Ned 17:44
Are my merfolk back to health? That was fine with it.
Brian 17:46
No, but there are other merfolk around there.
Ned 17:48
Right.
Brian 17:48
I mean, you yourself are not merfolk, but there are people. Just, could you please go grab a couple guards to come help us.
Ned 17:54
For sure.
Brian 17:54
And then she says, 'I am going to grab Dr. Mer, who is going to assist us in this examination.'
Ned 18:00
Is that like 'horse' or 'mayor?'
Brian 18:01
Uh, M E R.
Ned 18:03
Thank you.
Brian 18:03
But she pronounces it ""mare.""And she's going to just sort of go grab a Simic Elven doctor who is an older, by elf standards, so a man of wizened years, but you can see that he has sort of a bunch of sort of metal apparati on him to probably kind of help his body function in the way that he wants to. Some support struts, kind of a collar around his neck so that he can probably still maintain an upright position for the long hours of medical work that he needs in surgery.
So the cluster of you are brought downstairs to one of the lower floors. Things power wise seem to be kind of operating again. And you get taken into a larger operating room where has enough space for the bodies to lie down and everybody to stand. And Vizara kind of, like- Vezara lead Dr. Mere take over.
And he just kind of looks to all you and he's, 'Yes and what are we looking at here?'
Andrew 18:57
'You have the unique opportunity to examine the organic and biomechanical modifications of Dimir operatives of two varieties. One of which we have previously observed on the Boros line leading back to the 34th Precinct or the Boros Legion.'
Brian 19:14
'I see.'
Andrew 19:14
'The other seems to be entirely novel, at least to me.'
Brian 19:18
So the first thing he does is he kind of walks over to the two Elven twins.
Ned 19:23
The Feral?
Brian 19:23
Yes, the Feral Twins. The former concierge, Elven twins from down in the lobby who are now turned to some sort of feral creature. It takes him all of about five seconds. He kind of looks over, looks into the eyes, examines the claws kind of turns to you.
'Yes, pretty standard. vampiric corruption. Uncommon but pretty obvious. You can see by the dilation of the eyes and this sort of spontaneous claw formation of the nails. Some poor unfortunate weak minded fools came in contact with the vampire. They often populate the Dimir guild and, um, they get turned into this. They lose their minds ,develop a ravenous- not quite the zombies that you in the Undercity tend to construct yourselves. But along the same lines.'
Ned 20:10
'How long does it take to turn something into this?'
Brian 20:12
'Oh, it's almost instantaneous. It just takes a bit of a wave of the hand, a bit of mind magic that they are known for. Again, it's more weak minded individuals. I can't imagine that I would ever be fooled by such a trick.'
Andrew 20:26
'Then at least one vampire was present at the train.'
Ned 20:29
'Yes.'
Andrew 20:29
'Which means that Mr. Alfonso has been followed for quite some time.'
'Yes, it's all very academic and a bit disappointing. I was expecting something unique.'
Ned 20:38
'The second are two bodies, both in different states but with the same condition. Besides the obvious physical maladies, we found that there was a plug and still is in one of the bodies containing what our colleague describes as a 'smoke.' Upon releasing that plug we found inside,' and I produce the Dimir patch.
Brian 20:58
Ah. He goes, 'Interesting. Very generous of you to bring them into different states so I might compare.'
And again, he kind of has some tools that are partly attached to his apparati. Some he's just kind of holding in his hands and his long spindly Elven fingers. And he kind of leans down and begins sort of examining the cavity of the woman who is unplugged. And, without much consideration or ethical determination, just sort of starts sticking long metal things inside of there and switching around and a little bit of salve here, and a little bit of examination there, and a little bit of data coming through and he goes, 'Oh, yes, very interesting. No internal organs, no circulatory system. Nothing that normally is needed to keep a human alive. And you said she was more vital automated?'
Ned 21:45
'She was charming our comrades to sleep and was actively engaged in combat with us.'
Brian 21:51
'Oh, so she was commanding her own magical spells. Not puppet to the vampire's activities. She was making her own autonomous decision.'
Ned 22:01
In fact, when the vampire was killed by our other colleague, she proceeded to run.'
Brian 22:07
'And did not simply cease moving?'
Ned 22:10
'No.'
Brian 22:10
'Interesting.'
Andrew 22:11
'And when this one's self-terminated, the smoke that exited this one aperture seemed to be a substance that was, perhaps, piloting the body to begin with.'
Brian 22:22
'Self termination device. Yes. How very Dimir you would expect. They are guild of secrets, first and foremost are they not? Better to die than give up any information. And this, this young man here still has his plug intact?'
Andrew 22:36
'He does. If it can be properly described as a he.'
Brian 22:41
Dr. Mer asks some of the other medical staff on hand to sort of bring over some device and they sort of open a couple of crevices in the wall and is clear, that is some sort of vacuum that they are going to create. And they sort of bring this sort of spongy old tube that sort of looks like a, like a flower puckering its lips kind of down over the facility. It's all very strange here in the Simic Combine.
And they they sort of wheel this, this cart that has the young Dimir male on it over to the thing. And he with really no concern for his own safety, but at least a momentary concern for yours Dr. Mer kind of steps over with his long, spindly fingers and says, 'Mr. Biomancer, if you would do me the kindness of just standing back for a moment.'
And then he loops a finger underneath one of the plug in with a little more effort than is needed from an older Elven male, he just sort of pops it. And much as you seen inside of the apartment, a black sort of smoke and dust escapes and just sort of leaks out of this man. You can see his chest cavity sort of decompress slightly as, as the plug wound just sort of exhales like a long exhausted breath. And just '(exhalation)'
This sort of ash dissipates out from into him and is immediately vacuumed up into whatever this apparatus is that they have hanging from the ceiling. And you can see this sort of, you know, it's not glass, but it's sort of a clear filament bauble, inflate with whatever this gas is. And then the doctor seems very excited about everything and examines it.
For a brief moment before the excitement, very quickly, kind of leaving his face as he thought he might have actually seen something really interesting today and really didn't see anything quite at all, as you kind of watch the smoke just sort of dissipate within the orb itself and disappear. And he just kind of looks at all of you and goes, 'Hm. Well, that was a bit disappointing, to be honest with you. It's nothing more than an essence. It is not itself a pilot. It is intended to, simply, dissipate upon death, um, perhaps carrying a bit of memory with it in the hopes that wherever that gas ended up, it might relay a message whatsoever. But as you can see now it's dead and its message is gone and I'm sorry to say but you have two unfortunate vampire lackeys, who before you.'
Ned 25:07
'Is the Dimir patch inside the other cavity as well?'
Brian 25:10
'Oh, let me take a look.' And he kind of fidgets in there with some things and pulls out a very similar leather patch.
Ned 25:17
So I immediately take it in my hand and Ritual Identify.
Brian 25:20
Mhm.
Ned 25:20
Just to make the symbol appear.
Brian 25:23
Yeah, it's the same thing that you saw before. You kinds rub it with your fingers and you realize that it's just sort of like this thin ash filament and you work it for a couple minutes until eventually the, um, the scarab blue and black House Dimir clan symbol is visible.
Ned 25:40
'Is there any way to tell what it's a memory of? Is it of the original body that they are taking over? Is it the vampire that turned to them? What are they? What were they emulating?'
'Oh, these things are really not very complicated to be honest with you. Simply, probably, 'Here's where we were, here's who we were fighting, please don't send help because my life is meaningless.'
'And with the message be something...I mean we've lost it now, but would the message have been something that could have been important to someone receiving it?'
Brian 26:04
'Oh, no, I think you're putting too much weight on these sort of things. I have experienced Dimir magic in a rather unsettling way. Um, messages that need to be sent of great importance? There's many other spells. I've seen instances where people have recovered items for us to examine and they are literal thoughts that are just hanging out in the streets like a discarded piece of trash. This is simply the essence and the personality of whoever was inside of this. And now it's gone because these are the Dimir agents and life is worth much less than information. Much the way that we consider it, honestly.'
Ned 26:40
'Is there anything we can gain from these bodies to track it back to a source?'
Brian 26:44
'Well, I think the greatest of importance that I've been able to help you with is that you have vampire activity. You said you have experienced these instances before, my Elven friend?
Andrew 26:53
'Once before it was the former security personnel of one, Mr. Alfonso, and a swarm of them erupted from the train and fled into the city. We can only assume that a vampire attack took out the security personnel in the first place. The few individuals stayed behind to combat us were put down in short order.'
Brian 27:13
'Oh, and you experienced this within Mr. Alfonso's apartment?'
Ned 27:16
'Yes.'
Brian 27:18
'Oh, well, terrible tragedy, I suppose, in his eyes. It seems like he's been having some site of vampire interferences and is probably very grateful you happen to be on hand. Shame about his former security team, though. I hear they were quite effective.'
Ned 27:29
'Not effective enough.'
Brian 27:31
'Is there anything more that I can offer you gentlemen?'
Ned 27:33
'Doesn't feel like.'
Andrew 27:34
We have, we have all we-
Ned 27:36
We have all we came to find out.
Andrew 27:37
Came for really, but-
Ned 27:38
I guess, I suppose we could ask Vezara if there's been any new uncovering involving what was jettisoned to the bottom of the floor.
Brian 27:44
There have not.
Ned 27:45
Great.
Andrew 27:45
Well, there- it is, it is, it is worth asking, and I don't know if there's an expedient way to do this, how to lift the lock down short of killing whatever it is.
Ned 27:55
For sure. If we can't lift the lock down til the thing is dead, then we need to talk about how the hell we get to fight-
Andrew 27:59
How we do that.
Brian 28:00
Great. While you guys consider that, we will jump back to the Izzet research facility.
AD BREAK
So. the three of you are wandering back through this Izzet research facility, encountering all manner of people who are crazy and crazies who are probably intelligently smart. Before you sort of culminate into what is the center of the facility where they are monitoring and distributing all of the power that this hydro electric power plant is generating.
And there seems to be people on hand, not just of the Izzet, but there also seems to be some people on hand of some merchants, some lobbyists, some regulators. This is sort of a, 'Hey, we have a bunch of power, where is it going' type facility.
And as you guys are walking through, you can hear Lufola continuing to grumble about Malfus Reid in this, sort of, exacerbated dump of all of her thoughts about the man and there's a lot of words I'm not going to say on this podcast because they're just vulgar. But you do get to hear the majority of the theme of her rage is that the fact that she was expecting to take the role of Master Researcher. And she was in this position expecting to have it because the man she was working for, who was the head, was intending to retire. And then out of nowhere after that goes, the position was not offered to her.
The minute it was vacated word came down that Master Researcher Malfus Reid. a man who was kind of well known within the Izzet within certain circles, was just gifted this position after he just asked the Firemind. And there's a great deal of jealousy in there. Is, uh, 'Man, if I knew the Firemind and I was friends with the Firemind I bet I could get whatever I asked for too and he doesn't even care about hydro electric power. What does he even doing? Malfus Reid was a Master Researcher with the College of Spatial Recombination and Teleportation. What the hell does he care about hydro electric power? And he doesn't care about hydro electric power. He just marches his fat ass down here because his research funding gets cut and he just wants another cushy position. And this one was vacated, so no sorry Lufola for 11 years of dedication and research. Sorry for being a master of hydro electric power. Let's just offer this position to our buddy Malfus Reid because ""hey, I have tea with the Firemind."" And nobody talks to the Firemind so people pretend they know the Firemind. ""Oh, yeah, I know the Firemind."" You don't know the Firemind. Nobody knows the Firemind except for like three people. And it's all just bullshit. And we're here.'
Eddie 30:37
'Well, thank you for that.'
Sarah 30:39
'My mom gave my brother extra cookies once.'
Brian 30:41
'Look, I'm sorry, Boros soldier. But this is probably way over your head. And I really have no interest in entertaining your elementary discoveries. As for you, Azorius, whatever you need, please ask of me. I am willing to comply and I do not want it interpreted in any way that we are not going to work with the Azorius. Because I will not have a criminal investigation over my head to give somebody an excuse not to give me Master Researcher as a title.'
Eddie 31:10
'Please explain to me what I'm looking at.'
Brian 31:12
Oh, so you just see this massive like 20 by 20 foot display. And what you see is actually a major chunk of Ravnica. It is not just the compound that you guys are in.
So you see basically a city grid of the parts of Ravnica that this power plant happens to funnel out into. Part of the Izzet guild's responsibility is public works. So the maintenance of sewer lines, while the water is actually the responsibility of the Simic. Electrical power, utilities, that sort of thing. And this grid obviously is sort of like where all that power is going.
Then you can kind of hear the chitter and chatter of people around who are sort of- it's almost, strangely like a stock exchange. Is there are people from different guilds and non-guild aligned. They're sort of chatting with different people, lobbying, paying bills, trying to negotiate different power to be converted to different places here or saying that we kind of need more here. 'What does it take for us to get priority and a power outage?' It's all just sort of a massive Stock Exchange mess, but it makes sense to like everyone.
Zenia, would you please give me an Intelligence role with advantage?
Eddie 32:24
'It's interesting that he was fixated on this particular equipment, because the item in question was found at the bottom of the Simic well.'
Brian 32:34
So, Landree.
Landree 32:35
Yes.
Brian 32:36
With your Intelligence roll, there's something kind of peculiar about this light up display that you are taking a minute to kind of sink in. There's something strange about this and you need a second to find it.
Eddie, as you're kind of conversing with Lufola here, she exposits a little bit more about what the issue was with Malfus Reid. And, you know, she explains that he used to just come down here and just stare at this thing all the time. And she's spoken to all the people who work here and aggravatingly, he had no idea how this worked. The man was not prepared for his job whatsoever, was only Master Researcher. I mean, he is a master Researcher level, but he held this position in title only. But no matter how many times he came down here and talked with them and had them explain it to him, he never seemed to learn. So it was very confusing why he would keep coming down and ask them things like, 'Oh, can you show me what that thing does again? Or what if you press that thing over there.' And they kept asking him to manipulate the thing, but it was just sort of a weird waste of questions. He really had no respect within the facility.
Eddie 33:47
'Was there any aspect of this machinery that he was most interested in?'
Brian 33:51
'Well, the grid only does one thing. It just displays where our power is going and assigns where that power is going. But from my understanding, he never touched it himself. He kept asking other people to do it for him, because he claimed ignorance on how it works.'
Eddie 34:07
'Fascinating.'
Landree 34:08
'Is there any way, um, is there anything on the grid that indicates more power going in one particular direction?'
Brian 34:15
Yes. So strangely, what you are seeing, and because your college is what? You are Electricity and Storms?
Landree 34:24
Yes.
Brian 34:24
So that's your focus. So it's probably because of that science, that you happen to see something going on that people from Hydro Electric Power Distribution aren't. And that is: there are very minute, momentary blips of power channels going to various places, but they are random. So it's almost like, like, when you see some of those electrical toys that crack where, it's just like '(electrical noises)' Like little pieces of electricity, but it's there's no way to predict it because it's parking in particular areas.
So as you you look on a map, you might see that from the power plant to, like, 40 miles away, there's a strange arc for, like, anywhere from half a second to three seconds. And because the map is so big, and it's not sort of a dedicated channel where these massive power conduits are going. It's just like a tiny arc over here, and then another random tiny arc over there, and then a third random, tiny arc over there. And it's very consistent. It is like a crackling of micron thin power arcs happening all over the city that nobody monitoring this for any type of consistency would even notice.
Landree 35:35
Would I know if there's any connection between that kind of power arcing and potentially teleportation?
Brian 35:46
Well, there are people here to talk with. There are fellow scientists in the room, fellow people to discuss with. As of right now, it is very clear to you that you are the only person who sees this.
Landree 35:59
Oh, okay.
Brian 35:59
So it's, like, there is no way anybody in this facility have ever pieced together what is happening. So are there, there are people here to discuss and people here to talk to about it. It's just a question of how you want to go about that, what information you want, and what information you don't want to let know that you found, if any, if any.
Landree 36:20
Oh, okay.
'Um, Lufola. I'm curious. Um, I know that you're incredibly busy, obviously, but with very important things. But I don't know if you have noticed these concentrations. These pinpoints of electricity jumping. These blips jumping randomly over the map. It doesn't seem like any workers here are paying much attention to it.
Brian 36:41
So, as you say that she kind of starts looking and because it's so random, because you're like, 'Do you happen to notice that? I mean, that part will like not that part. But now it's over here.' Like how do you how do you make somebody's attention focused, but there is sort of a small Goblin monitoring the things and focusing the curls and just goes, 'Oh, Second Researcher, take a step back, take a step back, just, just take it in as a whole and, oh! She's right. Look at this here and look at this there and look at this here!'
And Lufola's eyes kind of roll around in separate directions inside of her head as she's going, 'Where is that coming from? What is the leak? What is all that? What it, what is that?'
And with a little bit of assessing, everybody kind of monitors the, the grid and looks in and says, 'Well, it's not, it's not really a massive output, it's really only enough to power like a small building. It's not enough to like do anything. I don't know that it would really constitute as a leak, it just seems to be arcing to random intervals into this chunk of the city.'
Landree 37:35
And it's all over the map? It's not in like a sort of concentrated area?
Brian 37:40
So it is all located within the reach of this particular power grid.
Landree 37:45
Ah.
Brian 37:47
Give me an, ah, give me an Investigation check with advantage.
Landree 37:52
Ok.
15
Brian 37:56
A 15.
You think whatever this is, it isn't credibly complicated because you're now realizing that you're attempting to ascertain random placement. Which, for an Izzet, is probably super exciting. But at the same time, you're like, 'I have to predict randomness, which is a complete betrayal of that concept.' But with some time, you might be able to narrow down some chunks. And perhaps with a little bit of information, a little bit of help, you might be able to find some sort of predictable randomness to what is going on. It's just going to take you a little bit of time and focus.
Landree 38:31
Yeah, because quite honestly, it seems as though this could be what Malfus Reid hims- if he wasn't, if he didn't have a hand in making these blips occur. Maybe him staring at this particular power display was him tracking it as well.
Brian 38:46
Possibly.
Landree 38:46
I would love to take some time to stare at it. That sounds something very fun to me.
Brian 38:51
Okay, so for the other two of you, as far as what needs to be done in this facility, Zenia is asking for a little bit of time to kind of be left in here to examine this and study what is going on here because she thinks she might be able to find out a pretty big missing piece as to Malfus Reid's movements and, and his, uh, his focus. So for now the appropriate thing for you guys to do would be to head back over to the Zonnet and try and sync up with the people there and learn what you could have about that crazy vampire that you dropped like a bad habit.
So after another brief period of time, let's say it'll take you somewhere after lunchtime for you guys to kind of sync up. The people at the Zonnet it will provide everyone with food as you guys get there and the four of you who are not Zenia get a chance to kind of link up together and share some information that you've learned
Eddie 39:48
Fabulous.
Andrew 39:49
'Malfus Reid was an expert in teleportation.'
Sarah 39:52
'Yes.'
Andrew 39:53
'And one half of Mr. Alfonso's train ended up where?'
Ned 39:56
'Different line.'
Sarah 39:58
'As if it had been teleported.'
Andrew 40:00
'I'm going to hazard a guess and say that's not an-' I'm gonna really blank on whatever that word is so take two.
Brian 40:05
Natural occurence?
Ned 40:05
Coincidence?
Andrew 40:06
Thank you.
'Going to hazard a guess and say that is not a coincidence.'
Ned 40:13
'I would also hazard a guess as someone who does not spend any time in the technological arts, but I would hazard a guess that teleportation requires a great deal of power. And I would guess that this facility generates most of the power in the city.'
Andrew 40:29
'So we have to ask ourselves one question: how long has Malfus Reid been working for the Dimir and in what capacity?'
Ned 40:34
'Or how long has Malfus Reid been controlled by the Dimir?'
Andrew 40:37
'Or how long has someone been assuming the identity of one-'
Ned 40:41
'Malfus Reid.'
Sarah 40:42
'Aw, you took my question.'
Andrew 40:44
'Sorry.'
Sarah 40:44
'That's okay.'
Brian 40:45
Master Biomancer Vezara saunters in and joins your conversation halfway through and says, 'Or how long has Malfus Reid been employing the Dimir? We are talking about a Master Researcher here. He would have been in possession of a quite brilliant mind.'
Ned 41:03
'Not to put too fine a point on it, but could you contact the Dimir? As someone at Master Reid's level?'
Brian 41:08
'Given the state of the quarantine, I don't think that's possible. And from a professional standpoint, I'm sorry to say that I refuse. What that would do to a merwomen in my position professionally would be irreparable even in the face of the ensuing catastrophe.'
Ned 41:26
'Could you point us in the direction to contact them ourselves?'
Brian 41:30
She rather sarcastically kind of just points a finger everywhere.
'The House Dimir had been a secret for over 10,000 years by their own device. They're not very easy to contact.'
Ned 41:43
'How do we lift the quarantine?'
Brian 41:45
'For what purpose?'
Ned 41:47
'To resume natural city. To bring us back to a sense of normalcy. What would it take to reset both the Izzet hydro power, and the pumps sending out to the rest of the city, and to get this city off of lockdown? I mean the Zonnet.'
Brian 42:02
'The current issue at hand is the water contamination. It will take several days of testing to determine whether or not the people of Ravnica do, in fact, have safe water to drink. My number one priority is making sure that crisis you sent to the bottom of the well is no longer a threat. However, if it is such an emergency that you leave this quarantine, I do have one idea. It may be possible but it comes with a great deal of risk and my professional career must be staked on more than simply wanting to have a chat with the spy guild.
Andrew 42:37
'Stopping the Golgari incursions, an offer I've made previously.'
Brian 42:40
'Yes, escaping through the Golgari invasion tunnels may be the only true way out. Where is your fifth?'
Sarah 42:48
'She's currently taking a look at the, the power grid within the Izzet facility to see what Master Researcher Reid may have been investigating. It seems his expertise was in teleportation. So it's very possible whatever he was researching was responsible for the division of Mr. Alphonso's train.'
Brian 43:09
'I see.'
Andrew 43:10
'And given his repeated contact with the Dimir, it seems possible that the Dimir have used his expertise to deploy agents where they might need them.'
Brian 43:18
'My concern now turns to those leasing land from me. Are the Izzet something I need to be concerned about? I have heard the name Malfus Reid although I do not believe I've met him personally. The only contact at the Izzet I know is a Lufola Senn.
Sarah 43:33
'She seems entirely dedicated to the Izzet and her research and while not very understanding of people from other backgrounds, doesn't seem to be much of a threat.'
Brian 43:45
'I would say for now, if you could find the credible reason for investigating this Malfus Reid, I would be willing to risk the Golgari tunnels. My advice for you is to reconnect with your fifth companion, formulate a plan, and then report back here. It seems, Devkarin, the time has come already for me to call upon that favor you owe me.'
Andrew 44:08
'Let me know precisely what you need.'
Sarah 44:10
'Are you going to give us the ability to breathe underwater?'
Brian 44:14
No.
Everyone 44:14
'(belly laughter)'
Brian 44:18
So, um, Landree needed some time to kind of investigate what they're doing. You guys now seem to have a game plan, there seems to be at least some arrows that are all starting to converge in the same direction. Right now, you guys need to know where to go for the information you are seeking.
The four of you march your way back to the Izzet facility. Since the very large and very authoritative people have already seemed to have cleared their way past that disgruntled old Goblin who works at the front desk. It takes zero effort for you guys to get led back into the research facility where you do find Landree scurrying away with notes and calculations and talking to four different goblins simutaneously-
Andrew 45:00
That thread between a few pins.
Brian 45:02
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Andrew 45:02
And rats, question mark?
Brian 45:02
And just going, and she's got, she's got her tie loosened and her hair's unfurled. And she's smoking her fifth cigarette into her seventh cup of coffee. And she's like, 'I know there's a connection here somewhere.'
Sarah 45:16
'Why do we name, why do you have a name tag that says Charlie Day?'
Brian 45:20
'You see, it's Izzet. That's Tizzi backwards.'
And it's just, you are getting, you are getting the full show of what actual Izzet research looks like. That stereotypical psychotic contemplation is on full on display.
Landree 45:39
Zenia is muttering to herself and she, out of the corner of her eye, sees the four of you approaches and she's talking to you but not really interested. 'Hey, guys, how's it going? What did you learn? What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm looking at the thing right now what's going on?'
Ned 45:52
'We didn't learn much.'
Brian 45:53
Oh, and please take some inspiration for that because that's awesome to me.
Landree 45:56
Thank you, thank you.
Ned 46:00
'We did not learn much. We learned that the Dimir are capturing their lackeys using vampiric corruption. We have been given an option to get out of the quarantine zone in order to investigate this further. But we need to be able to give the Zara a ironclad reason as to why and we are hoping you might have discovered one.'
Landree 46:22
'Why, why why why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why.' She just keeps repeating that to herself. Do I- have I found anything out?
Brian 46:30
Give me another Intelligence roll with advantage, please.
Landree 46:34
Oh, well, a 14.
Brian 46:36
A 14. I would say that after enough time, a 14 is good enough that you have developed a hazy idea of a predictable pattern. So what you have discovered that if you had access to -there are a couple of locations out there that have a higher probability of arcing. So where the exact pinpoint location maybe not quite so easy. You imagine that if you guys got together, and if you took a bit of a gamble, and you march to an area on the map, based on your calculations that you think might pan out, that you may be able to locate where this arc of energy is landing for the brief moment that it is.
Landree 47:19
'So here's a really fun game that we can play. If we find potentially this location, we search for this one, we might be in the possible location that it will occur. We wait for who knows how long? Because I don't know. Who knows? How do we know?! And we stand there for a really long time, it might just possibly happen.'
Sarah 47:42
'What?'
Ned 47:42
'Is there any form of consistency or structure to these aberrations?'
Landree 47:49
'There, there's certainly enough that I sense that if we try and maybe guess that we could potentially be in the right place.'
Ned 47:55
'Great.'
Sarah 47:55
'What'
Ned 47:57
'Is there a cause that you can ascertain?'
Brian 47:59
No, all you know is that this is, this is a hydroelectric power plant. And as psychotic as the Izzetcan be sometime, everything does have sort of a dedicated channel. It's just what happens at the end of that channel might lead into exactly what you predicted or an explosion. But the, the setup is always incredibly organized.
Ned 48:19
Mhm.
Brian 48:20
And what you have with the power plant is you have power on a grid.
Ned 48:23
Right.
Brian 48:24
That is traveling to intended locations through controlled intervals on pathways and infrastructure.
Ned 48:31
For sure.
Brian 48:31
And what she is seeing is random arcs of energy that are not traveling through a grid. They're not passing through an infrastructural situation. It's just= imagine if from the power plant to a tree in the park, there was some sort of arc of power for half a second to 10 seconds.
Ned 48:52
Right. No, I-
Brian 48:53
Right.
Ned 48:53
- understand that. My question is: that would imply that something in this facility is causing that.
Brian 48:58
Correct. But because everything is being output through the grid, there is no way for anyone to determine what could be leaking that energy because there's only one way out.
Ned 49:10
And could we, by any way, ascertain that these random aberrations have anything to do with a, well, I don't know, electrical line of railroads that are being built through Ravnica?
Sarah 49:20
Logic.
Brian 49:21
So Luf- Lufola, like turns to you with just that slow turn of disdain that just says without saying it, 'look, Fishman don't- you guys are ""scientists.""' Air quotes, she doesn't say it out loud.
Ned 49:36
I'm sorry, I was asking Zenia.
Brian 49:37
You guys are 'scientists.' But you dissect frogs like in grade school. We're dealing with actual physics here. That's just kind of the I underes you thing. And she says, 'The rail line is one dedicated path. I think I'd know if there was energy traveling down that path, because there's a line that signifies this path. And it looks like, according to me, I don't know to your fish eyes. But to me, that's a pretty consistent stream of power. The only way that power could arc off a grid from here to there is if somebody is literally like teleporting power from one place to another.'
Sarah 49:41
'I told you she wasn't pleasant.'
Ned 50:19
'Just a quick point: you did not discover this problem. It took our friends. So I would remind you that your science is severely lacking.'
Eddie 50:29
'I don't do science.'
Ned 50:34
Is thereanother thing there?
Eddie 50:36
Nope.
Sarah 50:36
He does Justice.
Brian 50:38
I just- 'I don't do science.'
Landree 50:41
'Quite honestly, I've been doing a lot of what you guys wanted to do without any hint of an explosion potential. So I would really love to go see what could possibly happen to us.'
Ned 50:50
'Well, that's horrifying. And the best idea I've heard all day.'
Brian 50:52
So the plan is you guys need to get outside the compound and blindly follow Zenia to a random location of her determination. And to the five of you, this makes the most logical sense?
And with great reservation, the remaining four of you realize that as crazy as she might be, somehow this might make sense to her, and it will never make sense to you. So the best option as of right now is to return to Vizara and see if she can offer you a way out of the quarantine.
Andrew 51:28
And what are the closest coordinates for any one of these power spikes?
Brian 51:33
You won't know till you get outside.
As the secrets behind Malfus Reid and the orb continue to unravel, you formulate the best plan you possibly can, making your way back to Zonnet Four for one final time. Your only compass in this maze of mystery is one half crazed scientist and her unpredictable intuition.
On the next Encounter Party! Our players are hot on the trail of Malfus Reid, unlocking the reason behind his tenure at Zonot Four. Their ace in the hole is their companion Zenia, trusting that she may have the possibility to blindly select a random location which may hold a clue to some unknown thing! Will Ravnica fall to the roll of a die? Find out next time on Encounter Party!

This week on Encounter Party! Trapped within a quarantine, our players discover that the villainous Malfus Reid was in fact a member of the Izzit guild. However, his plans are still unknown as our players turn their focus to the enigmatic Mr. Alfonso the Third. Strapped for cash, they enter his tenuous employment, but will it turn out to be more pain than profit? Find out this week on Encounter Party!
The night is dark and the hour is late. You are roused from your beds by a very paranoid Lennox Brightburn. Lorzatch, as you have snuck out into the main living room, you see that Mr. Alfonso's bedroom door, one you explicitly heard him lock, is now wide open. Floating above him is a tall vampiric creature siphoning the poor man's mind.
Sarah 1:10
Fuck is that?
Brian 1:11
Well, you don't see this.
Sarah 1:12
I know, but I just out of the description, like that's just-
Andrew 1:15
And now he's going to very quietly signal that everyone close on his position as fast as they can.
Ned 1:23
Loudly or quietly?
Andrew 1:24
Quietly.
Sarah 1:25
Should we sneak?
Andrew 1:26
Do they need to roll for stealth?
Eddie 1:29
I'm not good at sneaking.
Brian 1:30
Yes.
Sarah 1:31
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Andrew 1:32
Everybody do it.
Brian 1:32
What'd everybody roll?
Eddie 1:33
18
Brian 1:34
18.
Sarah 1:34
17
Ned 1:35
4!
Landree 1:35
I guess 4 with my-
Ned 1:36
Yeah!
Landree 1:37
With my, uh, modifier.
Brian 1:38
I believe technically it is a group majority and therefore because Lorzatch also passed on his sneak roll I will say you successfully-
Ned 1:46
Ooh!
Brian 1:46
- you guys sort of Marx Brothers just boop boop boop like -
Eddie 1:49
and I, is that -and I say 'Unhand him!'
Brian 1:51
Alright.
Eddie 1:51
-and I take out my mace.
Brian 1:53
Alright, roll initiative. Let's roll initiative
Ned 1:57
Whoo!
Brian 2:03
This floating thing, humanoid person: as soon as Lennox utters his boastful claim of 'get away from her, you bitch,'-
Eddie 2:12
Yesss.
Brian 2:12
-it turns to the door and faces you and just gives a loud <hiss> and will be surprised up until its turn. Zenia. Please go first.
Landree 2:20
Uh, I cast firebolt. <dice roll> <laughter> 7.
Brian 2:26
You do have options.
Landree 2:28
Oh, oh, uh, the-
Brian 2:29
To roll with advantage.
Landree 2:31
Now? Okay, sure.
Brian 2:32
Well, I'm just saying you will.
Landree 2:34
<laughter>
Brian 2:35
You will immediately roll on wild magic. I'm just- I'm just the devil in your ears
Ned 2:41
Just be worried there's a dude we'd like to not die. Directly underneath!
Eddie 2:45
We gotta go all out.
Ned 2:46
I just want to be clear there's a guy we're 'sposed to save. If he dies this'll be done.
Landree 2:52
Ok, yeah, let's do it!
Brian 2:53
Please roll another D 20 and let's see if you actually get this attack off.
Ned 2:56
Fuck my soul, Herc was on a roll.
Sarah 2:59
It's a 3.
Brian 3:00
It's another 3, oh no! You put just a little bit of extra effort into it. What I need you to do is, I need you to roll a D 100.
Sarah 3:12
Why are you making that face?
Brian 3:14
Oh, Zenia.
Yes.
Please roll a D 10.
Landree 3:17
Okay. 1?
Brian 3:21
Very disappointingly and kind of ineffectually, for whatever reason, you feel yourself one year younger.
Landree and Sarah 3:33
<deep laughter>
Landree 3:33
This is- She doesn't comment on it, but she's so upset because she just reached adulthood.
Brian 3:40
Right, right. And not only that, but just a little bit of experience is gone and you just feel like '<sigh> An older me would have landed that.'
Eddie 3:56
How old are you?
Landree 3:57
She was 41, now she's 40.
Eddie 3:58
Oh, ok.
Sarah 3:59
Now she's 12.
Brian 4:00
Which for, which for Vidalken-
Landree 4:02
Is very young.
Brian 4:03
Is very young.
Sarah 4:04
Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and charge at the vampire, hit it with my maces, hopefully. And that is going to be an 11 and an 18.
Brian 4:18
The 18 is a definite yes, the 11 is not.
Sarah 4:21
Okay, alright so...
Brian 4:22
So swing away.
Sarah 4:24
That is going to be a 10 damage
Eddie 4:26
Maximum damage.
Brian 4:28
Wow. 10 damage?
Sarah 4:29
Correct.
Brian 4:29
It seems, like, super motherfucking perturbed. It's like, 'Who are you, where the fuck did you come from, I thought you were all asleep, and ow.' Parax.
Ned 4:40
So, uh, around my neck on this seaweed and kelp rope is this crystal and I take it in my hand and through the translucence of my skin you can see it start to glow this light blue which permeates throughout my body and I latch my eyes right onto the vampiric creature and I cast Witch Bolt directly at it. Witch bolt is hitting at a 24
Brian 5:01
You son of a bitch.
Landree 5:03
Yes.
Brian 5:04
Yeah, it hit, yeah it hits.
Ned 5:06
Okay so it is a- 17 points of damage.
Brian 5:10
Yeah, it's like 'ow.' Jesus, you guys hit hard now. So you are connected. Now, this thing makes an immediate, sort of, scowl of rage at you with this ""(snarl)"" and then spins around with its cloak and seemingly disappears. However, you immediately know where it is cause you're still tethered to it and it has appeared behind all of you into the large communal room.
Ned 5:35
Everyone around and help cause I'm in the back.
Brian 5:38
What does happen, surprisingly, is the front door to the penthouse suddenly bursts open and when I mean 'burst open' I mean breaks off of its hinges and there at the entrance, for those of you who are not inside the private quarters, ie everyone but Fikkara, you can see the two Elvish twin concierges from down except for the fact that they now look exactly like what happens to Rufir's former security team and they are feral black clawed, black eyed, and are moving to attack. They have an incredible far movement. So the sort of telling thing about this, Parax, is they immediately bust in the door and immediately lock eyes on you and immediately fly over the railing, specifically trying to maul you and only you.
Ned 6:28
Yeah.
Brian 6:29
They are both going to attack you.
Ned 6:30
Yeah.
Sarah 6:32
Only you.
Brian 6:34
Uh, one is a 10, one is a 16.
Ned 6:36
So then, oof, I don't have a l- I have some hit points and there's no way for me to tell how hard they hit? Cause I can break this Witch Bolt and I can take Shield and I will be fine, but then we will not know where the invisible thing is.
Brian 6:46
If you ,y- oh no, he's appeared
Ned 6:49
Oh, okay.
Brian 6:49
I don't think it breaks your concentration. I think it just happens automatically.
Ned 6:54
Oh dope, well then I'm casting the outta Shield. So with shield they do not hit.
Brian 6:58
OK.
Ned 6:59
I take up my other arm and a round disk of outwardly invisible light comes up and I block whatever's coming my way.
Brian 7:05
Great. And you have now spent your reaction for the round but they very clearly-
Ned 7:11
But shield is active till the next time I play.
Brian 7:13
Correct.
Ned 7:13
Yes.
Brian 7:13
Correct. Correct. Correct. But it is telling that both of these things came out of nowhere. They weren't looking like this when you were downstairs a little while ago and now, Ned, they only seem to be focused on you.
Ned 7:25
Great.
Brian 7:27
Eddie, you're up.
Eddie 7:28
My turn?
Brian 7:28
Yes sir.
Ned 7:29
Yeah!
Brian 7:29
So as you quickly turn around, you see that those two twin elf concierges from downstairs are now feral humanoids sometime between the time you got up here and went to bed and they are defending that large vampiric creature.
Eddie 7:44
I cast Shield of Faith and attack the elf next to me with my mace.
Sarah 7:48
Well, you gotta have faith.
Brian 7:57
Roll some damage, please.
Everyone 8:01
Ohh.
Ned 8:03
What up, Lennox?
Brian 8:03
Plus, plus what?
Eddie 8:05
Three.
Brian 8:06
Plus three.
Andrew 8:07
14
Landree 8:07
Tasty.
Brian 8:09
So you dome this thing pretty good.
Ned 8:12
Which thing did you hit?
Eddie 8:13
The one right in front of you.
Ned 8:13
Thanks, man.
Eddie 8:15
No problem.
Ned 8:15
Really appreciate.
Brian 8:17
Lorzatch, welcome to the party.
Andrew 8:19
All right. As an action, Lorzatch is going to awaken the spores in his body. As a bonus action, he holds up two empty hands, cups one over the other, and spreads it out in a straight line and a scimitar of flame appears in his empty hand. He draws his dagger and he walks up to the two ghouls that are attacking his Simic compatriot.
Landree 8:43
Yes.
Andrew 8:43
End of turn.
Brian 8:43
Fikarra.
Sarah 8:44
Yes.
Brian 8:45
How many points do you have?
Sarah 8:46
27.
Landree 8:47
Whoa.
Sarah 8:47
Minotaur and I rolled sick.
Brian 8:49
27?
Sarah 8:50
Yes.
Brian 8:51
Great. Appearing directly in front of you, out of thin air, appears a small dark skinned woman in a full black hooded cloak and she just looks at you and goes 'Sleep.'
Eddie 9:04
Oh.
Brian 9:06
And you fall asleep.
Sarah 9:07
You bitch.
Andrew 9:08
Can't talk you're asleep.
Ned 9:09
And you can't defend Sleep.
Eddie 9:10
What?!
Brian 9:10
Sleep spell.
Eddie 9:10
Really?
Brian 9:12
So as long, as long as it rolls enough points, it spends a point per hit point and if it has enough points to buy your hit points you just fall asleep.
Ned 9:20
Someone has to wake you up. I almost took that spell. Didn't do it.
Eddie 9:24
Yeah, Sleep's a deadly spell.
So she's asleep in the room behind you and, and you guys are focused where you're focused. Although Zenia probably would have seen her drop cause she was so focused.
Ned 9:31
Yeah, I didn't see that they're Elves, yo.
Brian 9:32
No, Zenia is the only one who possibly would have seen this.
Sarah 9:35
That was a bitch move, Brian.
Brian 9:37
'(satisfied smirk)' Yes. Zenia, would you please make a- Would you please make a Charisma saving throw?
Landree 9:42
Yeah. 10.
Brian 9:45
You hear a voice pop up in your ear and it just says 'Leave,' and you now feel like the best thing for you to do is just walk out the room.
Andrew 9:55
What originates this attack?
Brian 9:57
You cannot hear it.
Andrew 9:58
Is it physically the room?
Brian 10:00
Is it physically in the room? Maybe. For what you know, because it is now Zenia's turn. You may still act, but your move must be- seems like a pretty good idea no matter what happens between now and there, 'I should walk out of the room.""
Landree 10:14
Ah.
Brian 10:14
You have a long way to go though.
Landree 10:16
I do, I do.
Brian 10:16
Sort of a big round about action.
Landree 10:18
Is it this way?
Brian 10:18
Yep.
Landree 10:19
Fantastic.
Brian 10:19
So you move your max speed in the shortest way towards the door, which would be around that table around the backside. You may still take actions.
Landree 10:26
Okay.
But all of you kind of see Zenia just sort of tip toe around and it's clear, like, she's making her way towards the door.
'Um. It's been lovely meeting you all, uh, but I do have places to go. But on my way, I would love to send a little help.' I'd like to cast, um, shatter, but I'd like to cast it as a careful spell because some of you I like. So I spend one sorcery point and I'm going to protect you three in the same room with me.
Ned 10:58
Come on girl!
Sarah 11:00
You can do it!
Landree 11:02
Yes! Finally a 20. Unnatural.
Brian 11:04
I think that's good enough to not need a Wild Magic try.
Ned 11:07
What does that do for us?
Landree 11:08
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of my choice within range. This beauty right here. She takes three d 8, but everyone in that 10 radius sphere needs to make a Constitution saving throw, but I can protect you guys from the spell's full force
Andrew 11:27
What's the rating?
Ned 11:28
We still have to do it though?
Eddie 11:29
It's 10 feet radius, you s-, 10 foot radius you said?
Landree 11:32
10 foot radius.
Eddie 11:34
Oh, I'm good.
Landree 11:34
Yeah, so I think you guys are actually.
Ned 11:35
Yeah, we'd be good in that scenario.
Landree 11:37
Well, are you in a 10 foot radius from it?
Ned 11:37
I might not be.
Andrew 11:37
You're not.
Brian 11:38
Ned, you are not. You are within.
Ned 11:40
So you said it's a Constitution save?
Landree 11:41
Yes.
Ned 11:43
Motherfucker.
Andrew 11:43
I'm fine, but this guy.
Landree 11:43
This guy's not.
Andrew 11:44
Has to make a Constitution saving throw as well.
Brian 11:46
Correct.
Landree 11:46
So that, yeah, that's gonna get a Constitution saving throw.
Ned 11:48
What do I have to beat for the Con?
Landree 11:51
13.
Ned 11:52
Did not.
Brian 11:53
He gets a 13 exactly.
Landree 11:55
Okay, so they each get seven damage.
Brian 11:57
Ok.
Ned 11:57
That includes me since I did not save?
Landree 11:59
Uh, no, cuz I used my Careful spell.
Ned 12:01
Okay.
Brian 12:02
So you take no damage or half damage?
Landree 12:04
You succeed on your saving throw against the spell.
Ned 12:06
Great.
Landree 12:06
Yeah.
Brian 12:06
Oh.
Ned 12:07
Dope talk.
Brian 12:07
Okey dokey. Seven damage
Landree 12:09
Um, Zenia gets very, very small inside her giant six foot frame and starts focusing intently and she starts shaking and shaking and she sends her hands out and thunder erupts from the center of the vampire, also striking this motherfucker right here.
And not you! Cause she likes you and then she's, she, then she sets her side on the door.
Brian 12:41
Parax.
Ned 12:42
Okay, so given the situation I'm in right now-
Brian 12:46
Yes.
Ned 12:46
I believe it is in my best interest to let Witch Bolt go.
Brian 12:48
Okay.
Ned 12:48
I say this because I can hit all three of them for a good amount of damage if I let this go.
Brian 12:53
Fine.
Ned 12:53
So Witch Bolt is released.
Brian 12:55
Okay.
Ned 12:55
The color of my skin seems to change from an emanating blue to emanating green and my hands starts to boil. I mean just, just heat emanates from my hands as I throw boiling water using Burning Hands directly at all three of them. Which is a 15 foot cone, but I'm aiming it so that the edge of the cone is not Zenia.
Brian 13:17
Okay.
Landree 13:18
Gracias.
Ned 13:18
Yeah, no, no worries. So you- oh wait I don't cast anything.
Brian 13:22
No.
Ned 13:22
It's a save.
Brian 13:22
We make saves and we take full or half damage.
Ned 13:24
Yes.
Brian 13:25
Okay. What is our target number?
Ned 13:26
13.
Brian 13:27
So the vampire does not save and the two elves. One of them does. So the one that is in the middle?
Ned 13:37
Okay.
Brian 13:38
The elf twin that is in the middle of the pack does save. The other twin and the vampire do not say.
Ned 13:43
Okay, and you are taking 14 points of damage. Each. Or seven for the non-save.
Brian 13:48
Mother effer.
Sarah 13:51
Did you say mother heifer?
Ned 13:53
Nope.
Brian 13:53
No.
Ned 13:54
But that's great. I love that.
Landree 13:58
She's sensitive.
The vampire, now sprayed with acid, is immediately regretting whether or not this was a good idea in the first place. One of the two feral elf twins has finally reached its limit and falls down dead to the floor. The other twin, conscious enough to realize what has happened, seems to get a little angrier. The vampire who was very keen on doing a lot of very terrible mental tricks to you decides that 'I think it's time to leave,' moves towards the window, flaps its cape, and smashes open the window with just enough room left in his movement to float outside. The remaining feral elf that is alive, Parax, has grown even more enraged at your audacity and makes a daring strike against you.
Andrew 14:45
It also makes a Constitution saving throw.
Brian 14:46
It makes a Constitution saving throw.
Landree 14:47
Yeah. All that. That is wild.
Brian 14:53
A 15.
Andrew 14:54
Yeah, it saves.
Landree 14:54
Oh, damn. Still though.
Brian 14:58
But it will strike twice at Ned. Both are a seven .
Ned 15:04
Great, I do not cast Shield.
Brian 15:08
So it misses. Lennox. You are up.
Eddie 15:10
I'm tired of these motherfucking vampires...
Ned 15:12
In this motherfucking penthouse?
Unknown Speaker 15:14
In this motherfucking penthouse. 'You will not escape justice.' And I reached out my hand and cast Hold Person on the vampire.
Brian 15:23
And what is the saving throw?
Eddie 15:24
13.
Brian 15:26
That would be an 11.
Eddie 15:29
'(triumphant laughter)'
Brian 15:29
So paralysis. It's paralyzed, right?
Eddie 15:32
Yes.
Brian 15:33
Shit. So, uh, paralysis sets in on this vampire floating outside the window who is like, 'this sucks, I'm out of here.' Suddenly, its whole body stiffens, it loses its ability of flight, and you just see this pale blue figure plummet out of your sight. And after a brief four seconds you do hear very faint splat.
Eddie 15:57
'There is no escaping Justice.'
Landree 15:59
Yes.
Brian 16:04
Oh, great. Lorzatch, you are up.
Andrew 16:08
Lorzatch approaches the elf ghoul and strikes with his flaming sword. And will hit with a 23.
Brian 16:20
Oh, how does this happen?
Andrew 16:22
Lorzatch twists his flaming sword and shoves it into the chest cavity of the elf and pulls up, bisecting it from his sternum through its cranium and flicks flaming viscera off of his blade and watches a vampire plummet to the ground outside the window.
Brian 16:42
Okay, so several dispatched.
Ned 16:44
But none of us know that the one in the room.
Brian 16:46
So.
Eddie 16:47
Where's the cow?
Brian 16:48
Well, what is happening is she's getting stabbedy stab stabbed as she is prone on the ground. Whatever that black cloaked figure was, that you can't even see because you are asleep, you are-
Sarah 17:00
Does this count as a short rest?
Brian 17:04
It's a very short rest. You do wake up as you feel two daggers just sort of stab into the holes in your armor.
Sarah 17:14
Rude.
Brian 17:15
Each attack gets advantage. That's a 18 and a 17. They both hit?
Sarah 17:21
Yeah.
Brian 17:22
Okay, so you will take four and then another four piercing damage.
Sarah 17:27
Okey dokey.
Brian 17:27
Lennox, how many points do you possess?
Eddie 17:30
24.
Brian 17:30
You possess 24 hit points which is less than Fikkara's. You hear a sound as a cloaked figure appears in front of you and just, 'Sleep.' And you just very quietly drift to sleep.
Andrew 17:43
It appears in front of him?
Brian 17:45
As another creature appears.
Landree 17:48
Dang.
Ned 17:48
Motherfucker.
Eddie 17:50
'<groan>'
Brian 17:50
So you guys see a cloaked, small-ish figure with daggers hunched, over very spy-like, who has just put one of your members to sleep.
Eddie 17:58
I call shenanigans.
Sarah 18:00
And you also do not know where 'the cow' is.
Andrew 18:02
I have this one.
Sarah 18:03
I'm a Minotaur!
I say, 'Where's the cow...'
Brian 18:05
Oh well, actually no, you probably would have screamed out in pain. So by now you have heard that something is going on in the other room. Zenia.
Landree 18:12
So Zenia still feels the desire to leave so she goes, 'peace out, buddies,' and she starts making her way to the door again humming to herself. '<humming>' And on the way she casts Dancing Lights and creates it as a humanoid figure. So, Frank appears next to her and she's just kind of dancing along she makes her way out the room.
Brian 18:37
Fikkara, you are prone.
Sarah 18:39
Yes.
Brian 18:39
Underneath this cloaked figure that is on top of you, stabbing you repeatedly with two very small knives.
Sarah 18:44
Okay, I'm awake now. Right? Cause stabbing hurts.
Brian 18:48
Yes.
Sarah 18:48
Ok!
Brian 18:48
You're very much awakened to the fact of knives stabbing you in the armpits.
Sorry, I'm just so used to being unconscious during combat now.
Landree 18:56
In the armpits?!
Brian 18:56
Well, that's where you go in armor because that's one of the weak spots.
Landree 18:59
Right. Oh, man that hurts.
Brian 18:59
There's nothing protecting.
Sarah 19:01
Yeah.
Brian 19:01
There's no armor in the armpits.
Ned 19:01
Generally hurts everywhere.
Sarah 19:03
Yeah.
Landree 19:04
True, but that's a sensitive place.
Sarah 19:05
Yeah, it is. And I'm not very happy about it. I am going to Vicious Mockery and just be like, 'You call those knives?'
Brian 19:14
'That's not a knife.'
Sarah 19:14
And it's a wisdom save 13.
Brian 19:19
Yes. Wisdom save of 13.
Ned 19:19
Oh, Fikkara.
Brian 19:22
They only roll an eight Ooh.
Sarah 19:23
Cool.
Brian 19:24
Don't touch my dice anymore, Landree.
Sarah 19:28
Oh, no, that wasn't her fault. I used them.
Landree 19:31
Oh.
Brian 19:33
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, we have the-
Eddie 19:35
Melt it.
Brian 19:37
Yes. We bid a fond farewell to this useless piece of plastic.
Sarah 19:41
Okay, they will take two and I believe that's psychic? Yeah two psychic damage. And then I will reach around and whack them with my mace and al-
Brian 19:54
Sound stick.
Sarah 19:55
My boomstick. It is a boomstick! I hit them with my boomstick. And that will be a 13?
Brian 20:01
A 13 will hit.
Sarah 20:02
Fantastic.
Ned 20:03
Yeah.
Sarah 20:03
And then, they will take a total of six damage.
Landree 20:08
Nice.
Brian 20:08
They take six damage.
Sarah 20:10
Yes. And can I get up as a bonus action?
Andrew 20:13
That was your bonus action.
Brian 20:14
That was your bonus action.
Sarah 20:15
Alright.
Brian 20:17
You used your bonus action to Vicious Mockery.
Sarah 20:19
Okay.
Brian 20:19
So you are still remaining on the ground.
Sarah 20:20
Gotcha.
Brian 20:22
Parax.
Ned 20:23
I am-
Brian 20:24
A new challenger approaches.
Ned 20:25
Yes. So I'm going to turn around and the, the glow within the crystal goes back from its previous screen back to blue. And I extend my hand and a bolt flies out as Witch Bolt flies at the new challenger.
Brian 20:37
Okay, the saving throw is what?
Ned 20:39
It's not a saving throw.
Brian 20:39
Oh, it is not a saving throw. It's an attack roll.
Ned 20:41
19
Brian 20:41
A 19 will hit.
Ned 20:43
Okay. Where's my damage dice?
Brian 20:44
Whenever these things take damage, it's almost sort of pathetically human.
Ned 20:49
That is 15 points of damage.
Brian 20:51
Oh, mothershumala.
Ned 20:52
Oh wait, I'm so sorry. It's not. It was a level one in cast. Not a two. So it did six points.
Brian 20:56
Thank you.
Ned 20:57
Yeah, gotcha.
Brian 21:00
Like 'Whoa.'
Ned 21:00
If I got the second die, it was 15, but I didn't get the second die.
Andrew 21:01
No, no no no.
Brian 21:02
Okay, well, both of those things are dead. So Lennox. You are up.
Eddie 21:07
I am snoring.
Brian 21:08
Yes.
Ned 21:09
Very asleep.
Eddie 21:09
You are snoring. You see your friend snoring. Lorzatch.
Sarah 21:13
Wait, both of what? Oh, nevermind.
Andrew 21:15
Lorzatch will approach the vampiric thrall, question mark? And will strike with a flaming blade.
Brian 21:23
Oh yeah, whatever that high one is? Yes. I'm seeing numbers that are higher than its armor class before you've even done stuff.
Oh, mother.
Landree 21:34
Oh!
Brian 21:35
Oh no.
Landree 21:37
Yes.
Eddie 21:37
Lorzatch is a badass.
Landree 21:39
Yeah.
Andrew 21:39
23 damage.
Landree 21:40
Yes.
Brian 21:40
20- oh my god. So, as this thing appears out of nowhere and just sort of discerns that perhaps the law mage that just killed this vampire outside is the primary target. And no sooner does it get to just, 'Sleep,' when Lorzatch sort of leaps across the room with this weapon and just nearly eviscerates whoever this smaller human is. Just absolutely wrecking his night. Holy cow. That is a lot of damage. Still alive.
Andrew 22:08
Does a 20 hit?
Brian 22:09
Yes.
Andrew 22:09
Then there's also...
Brian 22:10
Oh no. There's more?
Andrew 22:14
Four damage.
Brian 22:14
Oh no.
Landree 22:15
Yes.
Brian 22:16
Is it a particular type of damage?
Andrew 22:17
Uh, slashing and poison.
Brian 22:18
Slashing and poison. Okay. Oh my God. Okay, it'll be a quick night tonight folks. Um, still alive, however it will begin its turn within your spore range, correct?
Andrew 22:28
And it will make a Constitution saving throw.
Brian 22:31
And it will.
Ned 22:31
We're making a sound bite for it, I just want to be clear.
Brian 22:34
It's just gonna be me going '(deep sigh)'.
That would be a natural one. How much more damage does he take?
Sarah 22:44
Fuck your couch.
Brian 22:45
That's another one under there.
Andrew 22:47
Two necrotic damage.
Landree 22:49
Ok.
Sarah 22:49
Better than none.
Landree 22:50
Yeah.
Brian 22:51
So just for clarification within one person's action, it has taken 29 damage. She's still alive.
Landree 23:00
Lorzatch.
Brian 23:01
But mother heifer. So after 29 points of damage, as you've backed it into a corner, absolutely lit up it's night. Um, this small human that you can see as a male kind of looks up to you frighteningly, sticks his hands up, and asks you very politely to make a Constitution saving throw.
Andrew 23:19
Six?
Brian 23:20
It looks to you and it says, 'Please stop, I'm not here to hurt you ,I'm here to help you!' And it is very clear that this is evident to it. So for your, all your in- as far as you can tell, this thing has only put your friend to sleep and it is not here to hurt you. It is your friend. Top of the order: Zenia.
Landree 23:39
So, well I'm '(humming)'
Sarah 23:47
For the audience, Zenia is just calmly walking out of the apartment.
Brian 23:53
As soon as you leave- as soon as you, as soon as you step outside the door, you're like, 'why did I come out here? There's a fight going on in there! Here.' So that will be your turn, but you just kind of exit the front door like, 'what am I doing out here?'
Andrew 24:10
Did I leave the stove on?
Brian 24:12
And your suggestion is no longer present. So the other humanoid is going to attack Fikkara. As you are still on the ground: a 20. A non-natural 20 and an eight, which I'm assuming does not hit.
Sarah 24:27
Yeah, the 20'll hit though.
Brian 24:29
Yes. And you will take three points of piercing damage.
Sarah 24:33
Okay. I mean not 'okay,' but-
Brian 24:35
And. And suddenly, this thing that was on top of you-
Sarah 24:38
Yeah.
Brian 24:38
After getting rocked in the face by a mace.
Sarah 24:40
Right.
Brian 24:41
And kind of doing minimal amount of stabby damage to which it was kind of mocked for.
Sarah 24:46
Yeah.
Brian 24:46
It's cloak kind of swirls around it into a little pocket and it disappears.
Sarah 24:50
No!
Brian 24:50
Those of you outside the room suddenly see another one of these figures appear and looks like they're trying to make towards the door. Zenia, having completely ignored the person who just popped up behind you, exits through the doorframe, and immediately turns around to question why you even walked out here in the first place. And then your Suggestion. Fikarra.
Sarah 25:10
Alright, so it just disappeared in front of me. I'm going to get out and...
Brian 25:15
You're going to stand up.
Sarah 25:16
Stand up. Yes.
Eddie 25:17
'(snores)'
Sarah 25:18
And then, walk out the door.
Brian 25:21
Okay.
Sarah 25:21
And...
Brian 25:22
You see Lennox asleep on the ground.
Sarah 25:25
So I...
Eddie 25:27
'(snore)'
Sarah 25:28
Slap the shit out of Lennox to wake him up.
Brian 25:33
Make an attack roll? Uh, barehanded. Barehanded.
Ned 25:38
It's an Unarmed Strike.
Brian 25:39
Unarmed Strike.
Sarah 25:39
Yeah, I still have a fucking wicked Unarmed Strike.
Brian 25:41
I know but let's not brain him. Well, you are careful enough to not piss him off.
Sarah 25:47
Yeah, I rolled- I mean so that would make it like a five.
Brian 25:49
Last thing you know there was something tiny in front of you, you blinked, and now there's a massive cow right in your face.
Eddie 25:58
'(yelp)'
Brian 25:58
Parax.
Ned 25:59
So while still holding Witch Bolt-
Brian 26:01
Yes.
Ned 26:01
I extend my hand right at it and the tether strengthens to deliver another 12 points of damage.
Brian 26:07
You are fucking kidding me.
Ned 26:09
God bless the D 12.
Brian 26:11
Wow. Okay, so, oh, son of a bitch. So, you just see this massive amount of energy again just drop this guy to his knees. Lorzatch, this person that you have just met is clearly not meant there to hurt you but the people there seem intent on killing it. Um. This person that probably shouldn't be killed and he looks like he is about to die. Lennox, you are up.
Eddie 26:34
I kill it.
Brian 26:38
So bonus action, stand up, move over and swing. Make an attack roll please.
Eddie 26:50
I cast Ensnaring Strike and I swing. That's a 14.
Brian 26:58
That's a 14. A 14 does hit.
Eddie 27:01
So with that, I strike the beast and blue tendrils-
Brian 27:04
It's a person. It's like a little person.
Eddie 27:06
I strike this cute little, sad looking person who, with fear and its eyes, with my mace in its face. And as I hit it, blue tendrils of magic wrap around its body. These tendrils of magic also have spikes on them. And it takes one die six damage. Six damage.
Brian 27:25
So as the tendrils wrap around it and you basically dome this small man in a cloak. You can see that it was making a grab for its chest before the tendrils managed to ensnare it and then your mace just 'splat' into his face, into a now unrecognizable mashed potato.
Eddie 27:47
'The hammer of Justice.'
Brian 27:49
Lorzatch. Watching this person die in front of you, you are immediately aware that it was confusing you with magic to feel pity for it and now you are even more the angrier that it dared try to meddle with your mind and while that one is dead, there is another one to exact your revenge upon.
Andrew 28:10
It is Lorzatch's turn?
Brian 28:11
Yes.
Andrew 28:12
'Only one left.' Lorzatch turns and runs headlong towards the other and swings with a flaming sword. And it kinda whiffs with maybe a 10!
Brian 28:25
A 10 won't hit. It is very agile. It sees the flame coming from half a room away. Swing and a miss. So this small-ish woman in a cloak who is now completely outnumbered, completely found out, and unable to escape, leaps the banister and runs up the staircase to try and get away. Upon throwing open the door is Zenia, just standing there. Hi. And what what you see is this woman, this small, dark-skinned woman. Her cloak kind of falls back enough for you to see that she is just a young human and then in a great deal of panic, she looks at you and then she kind of furrows her eyes, closes her eyes, reaches under her cloak, and you see her pulls some sort of pin out from her chest and smoke just sort of dissipates into the air. And the rest of you don't necessarily see what she did. But she just falls down dead.
Landree 29:29
That lady does?
Brian 29:30
Yes.
Landree 29:30
Zenia's so taken aback and so, now she's just humming to comfort herself. '(humming)' As she slowly makes her way back up to where everybody else is.
Andrew 29:47
Lorzatch immediately runs into the master bedroom to check on Alfonso.
Brian 29:52
Alfonso is still laying in his be, but sort of writhing and in pain in the way one might be with a migraine. He doesn't really want to open his eyes. Thankfully, the lights are still down. He doesn't want to really lift his head up off the pillow. He doesn't even really want to hear anyone talk. He seems to be in a great deal of mental pain. But he is curious as to what happened with this just sort of, 'Oh my.' Somehow persisting his politeness with every whimper. 'Oh my, is everyone alright?'
Andrew 30:25
'We are now.'
Sarah 30:26
'Mostly.'
Brian 30:26
'Is anyone like to explain to me what happens in the least amount of words possible?'
Andrew 30:32
'Your penthouse was set upon by vampires sent by the Dimir.'
Brian 30:35
'Oh well, that answer a great questions now, doesn't it?'
Sarah 30:39
'It does?""
Brian 30:40
'Oh no, I suppose it just asks a great deal more questions, doesn't it? You see, this is the problem with the Dimir: the more you learn, the more you wish you didn't know.'
Ned 30:48
'Does seem to be the way doesn't it?'
Brian 30:51
'Yes, quite.'
AD BREAK
Brian 31:30
'That cabinet over there. I have something expensive that isn't very good for my liver. Would you please fetch it for me?'
Andrew 31:38
Lorzatch does.
Brian 31:39
Yeah, it's just some sort of dark liquor that he sort of takes and takes the time to request a glass and pour a proportion measure and then take a very dainty sip and that's about all he needs. And just kinda shivers with a little, 'Ooh, yes, has the medicine, don't you know? Yes, is everyone all right? M window.' He kind of looks at the window and he goes, 'Oh, the Elves downstairs and not going to be very happy about that. Oh, the Elves downstairs!' and just sort of looks to the floor and just asks for a very brief explanation as to like what in the fuck just happened?
Landree 32:18
We killed them.
Brian 32:19
'I can see that.'
Landree 32:20
Vampires.
Sarah 32:21
Vampires.
Brian 32:21
'Vampires! And where are the vampires?'
Sarah 32:23
'Out the window'
Ned 32:24
'On the ground floor.'
Brian 32:25
And he kind of leans out the window and, like, looks down. There is a corpse down there.
Eddie 32:30
I want to go down and check that body.
Ned 32:32
For sure.
Brian 32:32
Go down and check that body?
Eddie 32:36
Mhm.
Brian 32:36
So, um, where's everyone-
Ned 32:37
He's got that kind of energy.
Brian 32:38
Where is everyone going to be? Where's An-?
Ned 32:41
He's just like really into it?
Andrew 32:43
So, Lor-
Brian 32:43
Where's everybody- going to check body, going to check a body!
Andrew 32:48
Lorzatch, will-
Brian 32:49
Yes.
Andrew 32:49
Once he's satisfied that Alfonso was not hurt, check this body crumbled in the corner.
Ned 32:55
I- so I would probably want to look at a vampire. But I'm also really curious about this, I'm also really curious about this-
Eddie 33:00
I go downstairs and look at the vampire.
Andrew 33:02
'You guys won't see it dead body?'
Brian 33:04
So, Lorzatch, you are examining what? The human that dared try and suggest you were friends?
Andrew 33:10
Yes.
Brian 33:11
Um, human with quotation marks. Lennox. You're gonna go downstairs and look at a vampire?
Eddie 33:16
Yeah, I am.
Andrew 33:17
Parax, you are going to examine these feral creatures?
Ned 33:19
I'm going to cast, uh, I'm going to start a ritual of Detect Poison and Disease.
Brian 33:23
Freaka, where are you going? Fikkara, were are you going? Sorry.
Sarah 33:25
I'm going, I'm going to do my damn job and make sure that Mr. Alfonso's okay and stay in the same room with him.
Brian 33:30
Sounds great and Zenia?
Landree 33:32
I think I go back to where the woman disappeared into a puff of smoke.
Brian 33:36
Yes. Her body is still there.
Landree 33:38
Fantastic. So I'm going to go back. Um, I'd love to cast Detect Magic if I can.
Brian 33:43
Okay, so let's, let's just go in initiative order just for the sake.
Because everybody's gonna do individual stuff.
Ned 33:47
Great.
Sarah 33:48
Sure.
Ned 33:48
Yeah.
Brian 33:48
This is great. So please.
Landree 33:50
So I cast Detect Magic on her body.
Brian 33:52
Yes.
Landree 33:53
Um, and I don't need to go for it.
Brian 33:54
Um, there are a great deal of magical things going on here. Without sort of identifying exactly what they are, you can pinpoint a couple of things.
Landree 34:05
Okay.
Brian 34:06
There is or was some sort of magical enchantment on the cloak.
Landree 34:12
Okay.
Brian 34:12
Also there is magic residue on the small cavity that is now inside her chest of whatever that plug was. A lot of this is residual, but there is a small, black leather square that is tucked inside the cavity that you can see if you wish to pull it out.
Landree 34:34
Yeah, I take it.
Brian 34:35
It's a small, blank, black leather patch but it does have magical qualities to it.
Landree 34:41
I take it out of her chest cavity and I sniff it. Um, does anything happened to me? Am I safe?
Brian 34:47
You're- yup.
Landree 34:48
Fantastic.
Brian 34:49
It is magical
Landree 34:50
It is magical. That's what I know. And so I go back up to the room with everyone else if I've discovered everything that I-
Brian 34:57
Mhm.
Landree 34:57
Fantastic
Brian 34:59
I mean as far items, she has two daggers.
Landree 35:02
I'm good with daggers. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you
Brian 35:05
Fikarra, you are maintaining.
Sarah 35:07
Yes and I will actually take a hit die to regain hit points.
Brian 35:11
Great. Parax.
Ned 35:13
I'm going to begin the ritual of Detect Poison and Disease, which gives me a 30 foot radius of all poisons, diseases, poisonous creatures, and what they are. Cuz I'm actually kind of curious if Alfonso's got some hiding in here.
Brian 35:25
It's a 30 foot radius?
Ned 35:26
30 foot radius.
Brian 35:27
From where you are?
Ned 35:28
30 feet from me.
Brian 35:29
You can detect some poisons.
Ned 35:31
Great.
Brian 35:32
Does it specify if you can detect where?
Ned 35:33
I can detect the kind of poison, the poisonous creature or disease, and where it is within 30 feet of me.
Brian 35:39
Interesting. Okay, there are three.
Andrew 35:39
He's got poison too.
Ned 35:39
Okay. And they are where?
Brian 35:39
One of the poisons.
Ned 35:39
Or diseases.
Brian 35:39
Or diseases.
Ned 35:39
Okay.
Brian 35:39
There are no diseases.
Ned 35:39
Okay.
Brian 35:39
There are two instances of the same poison that seem to be identified on the two cloaked bodies that you see.
Ned 35:39
The cloaked bodies.
Brian 35:39
The cloaked figures.
Ned 35:59
So the human ones?
Brian 35:59
The human on the staircase at the entrance and the human one in the corner by Lorzatch.
Ned 36:04
Okay, and do I know what it is?
Brian 36:05
Um, it is a basic poison that you would use to, like, coat weapons and things like that.
Ned 36:12
Ok.
Brian 36:12
Nobody seems to have been attacked by poison, but the option was there. There is also a- inside his room, at least as far as you can detect, there's a cabinet there by the entrance, which happens to be the same cabinet that the liquor was pulled from. There are two small vials of poison. One of them is a scorpion poison and the other one is in an identifiable poison of concerning potency.
Ned 36:38
Dope. Okay.
Brian 36:40
It is a potent poison.
Ned 36:42
And the third?
Brian 36:43
Those are the three.
Ned 36:44
Oh, okay, great. And I don't sense that on the ferals? In any way?
Brian 36:46
There is no poison on the ferals.
Ned 36:48
Or disease?
Brian 36:49
No disease.
Ned 36:49
Well, that's a horse of a not expected color.
Brian 36:53
Well, you've never seen these before.
Ned 36:55
Sure.
Brian 36:55
Right? Yeah. So your 'whatever this is' wasn't where you thought it might have been.
Ned 37:00
Right.
Brian 37:01
Yes.
Ned 37:01
The ferals were not caused by disease as I understand it due to the ritual.
Brian 37:06
Correct.
Ned 37:06
Right.
Brian 37:07
Lennox.
Eddie 37:08
Mmm.
Brian 37:08
You make it down.
Eddie 37:09
Yes.
Brian 37:09
As you pass through the lobby, one thing that you notice is the concierges are nowhere to be found. Suddenly the lobby is just a lot less friendly and the a lot less polite. As you sort of step out into the night air quietly, with nothing to accompany you except for the nauseating continual rush of the waterfall probably a mere 200 yards away from where you are. At the bottom is this body. Humanoid. Vampiric. Pale, blue skin. And as you approach, it is already starting to turn to dust. Within a mere 30 minutes, the wind will probably take it away. It wears a dark cloak.
Eddie 37:46
I take the cloak.
Brian 37:47
You take the cloak. You now have a dirty, dark cloak. It is-
Eddie 37:52
I search the body and I take anything that I think, I think, I take everything.
Brian 37:57
Sure. So what this thing is wearing is kind of gross. Perhaps it is that undead creatures have no need- as a cleric you can tell this is undead. Probably have no need of cleanliness. It looks like it's kind of been dragged through the Undercity. The only other discernible thing it has on its person was it was wearing a ring that has a black gem.
Landree 38:24
Ooh.
Eddie 38:24
I take it.
Landree 38:25
Yes.
Brian 38:27
You now have a mood ring.
No, but you do have you do have a a nice looking ring with a black gem on it. Lorzatch.
Andrew 38:36
Lorzatch will examine the body of the humanoid that was casting various Confusion and Charm related spells. Roll a perception? Medicine?
Brian 38:48
It depends on what you're trying to examine. If you're trying to search its body, if you're trying to discern medical things.
Andrew 38:54
I will-
Brian 38:55
Maybe consider the steps in which you're going to do that.
Andrew 38:58
Search for possessions, but one of his major points of interest is whatever it is that he was reaching for in and around his chest. Cause there doesn't seem to be a pocket there.
Brian 39:11
Right.
Andrew 39:11
Right?
Brian 39:11
Correct.
Andrew 39:12
He will search.
And if we're talking about Medicine, it is a 20.
Brian 39:19
So what this person is wearing is clearly meant for stealth. It's all black. A black hood. He himself is dark-skinned, as if they were looking for whoever had the best chance of shadowing away in the night. But there also is this sort of almost pathetic youth to this character so that maybe if they were ever discovered, they would be perceived as non threatening. He possesses two daggers, which are probably his primary mode of attack, and there is small cavities of poison on the belt that would just simply require him to, in one motion, be able to drag the dagger across, sever the pouch, coat the blade, and continue his attack. It's all very efficient and tight and tactical. Whatever he was reaching for is just under the shirt. So all it would take was a little bit under, just to dip a finger under the collar to be able to grab the loop, but not something that could accidentally be snagged by an outside force. It is a plug. And then there is a small metal ring that differentiates the cavity between the plug.
Andrew 40:29
And this is something that inserts through pectorial muscle and bone into the chest cavity?
Brian 40:35
As far as you can tell right now, you would just see a plug at the top of his- if you try, if you try and just sort of manipulate it a little bit without pulling it? From what you can see there is a plug that goes at least under his skin.
Andrew 40:49
Lorzatch will take the poison applicators.
Brian 40:51
Okay, so these are part of the belt.
Andrew 40:54
Mm.
Brian 40:56
So what there are is you can take the belt as a whole.
Andrew 40:59
Mm.
Brian 40:59
And it has two of these pockets, one on each side. So once they are, once they are severed they are used. So it's not like a continual application. There's sort of, like, one time use patches on the belt. But could you give me an herbalism check, please?
Andrew 41:14
20.
Brian 41:15
Great. You easily identify this as some sort of manufactured poison through poisonous plants. And it's easy for you to just- you would be able to, on s one time use, puncture those pockets to put poison on your blades. And then continuous strike, adding a one time use of one D six poison damage in addition to whatever else your weapon will be doing.
Andrew 41:38
Got it.
Landree 41:39
I'd also like to take this opportunity while Mr. Alfonso is having a headache and, and otherwise distracted to just go through stuff in his room.
Brian 41:51
Ah.
Ned 41:52
I'm simply going to go in and let him know that I found the poison and next time he should keep it more readily available to use.
Brian 41:58
He's going to go 'Oh, my dear boy, there are more dangerous things in this room than vampires. Oh, I could have destroyed him in one shot if I'd been awake.'
Sarah 42:08
I take one step back from Mr. Alfonso.
Andrew 42:13
He, he heavily suggested that a number of things in the room are booby trapped or possibly keyed to his personal loan.
Sarah 42:20
Yeah, so probably not a bad idea.
Andrew 42:23
It's, I think, okay to look but not touch.
Landree 42:26
Okay.
Andrew 42:26
Maybe?
Landree 42:26
Is that a warning that you maybe? I think I also hear him say that.
Brian 42:30
Give me- please make an Investigation check.
Landree 42:34
Oh, that's good. 23
Brian 42:36
Ooh, excellent. Could you do me a favor?
Landree 42:39
Yes.
Brian 42:39
So a couple of the things that you see. Would you please roll a D 100?
Landree 42:45
Sure.
Brian 42:45
And I will determine how many things you can see.
Landree 42:49
90.
Ned 42:49
That's a D 10. You have to roll it again.
Landree 42:49
Oh, sorry.
Eddie 42:49
You have to roll both of them.
Landree 42:51
Oh, shoot. Sorry.
Ned 42:51
Well, just roll a second one you got a 90 and now you're rolling the one spot.
Sarah 42:55
99.
Ned 42:55
99.
Brian 42:56
A 99. In a small display case on one of the banisters, you see what looks to be an amulet shaped like an artistic interpretation of what might be the Azorious signet.
Landree 43:08
I cast Detect Magic.
Brian 43:10
It is magic.
Landree 43:11
Okay. Do I sense anything further? Can I tell what kind of magic or?
Brian 43:15
Well, you're not sure if it is magical or if the case is magical, but there is magic.
Landree 43:20
I see. Okay. Okay.
Brian 43:22
Would you please roll another D 100?
Landree 43:24
18.
Brian 43:27
You see some randomly scattered cooking equipment in not a kitchen area and in a place where he doesn't make his own food.
Landree 43:34
Ok.
Brian 43:34
It's just sort of stacked there. Politely. pPlease roll another D 100.
Landree 43:38
87.
Brian 43:38
87. You happen to see, uh, tucked next to one of his foot lockers kind of under one of the dressers is a coil of rope that has blue threads to it.
Landree 43:54
Ooh.
Brian 43:54
Roll another D 100 please. You have two more of these.
Landree 43:57
Oh. A 22.
Brian 44:00
There is a lovely bottle of perfume.
Landree 44:03
Okay.
Brian 44:03
And one more if you would please.
Landree 44:06
85.
Brian 44:07
Something that sort of strangely strikes your eye is he has kept some sort of carving. Somebody took a stick and carved it into the shape of a fish.
Sarah 44:19
Aw.
Ned 44:20
Billy Bass makes an appearance.
Brian 44:22
Get out of my head!
There's also, there's also a great deal other things. Some potteries, some pieces of pottery, some stones with some carvings on it, several things of the like.
Landree 44:34
Alright. This was all, truly, curiosity based so I don't touch any of it.
Brian 44:39
Okay.
Andrew 44:40
Are we all sharing our findings about what's on-
Ned 44:43
Yes.
Andrew 44:43
Great. Lorzatch is going to compare the two humans that remain on this floor and then is going to take time to go downstairs.
Brian 44:52
You will find a similar belt on the other human.
Andrew 44:55
Four pockets.
Brian 44:57
Yes, but they must be adorned two per belt.
Andrew 45:00
Double belt.
Brian 45:01
Double belt, you prick.
Andrew 45:04
No, but-
Brian 45:05
Wow, got around that puzzle real quick, didn't he?
Andrew 45:09
Will, uh, does Lorzatch need to roll Medicine to check the plug that is in the other body that's out in the hallway?
Brian 45:17
Yes, because it is different. Not different in size but it is in a different state.
Andrew 45:22
20
Brian 45:23
Great. So what you can see without really sacrificing too much of your safety is- you see in her right hand on the floor is the ring from the plug is still wrapped around her middle finger and you can just sort of feel, spatially, that inside the cavity is completely hollow. In fact, her whole body chest cavity is sunk just a little bit more than you would expect from a dead person. As if there is literally nothing left on the inside. And unfortunately of your position you didn't see exactly what happened but they are in two completely different states.
Andrew 46:02
Mm.
Landree 46:03
Oh, and to be clear, I do show the black leather magic thing that I found in the one body as well.
Brian 46:09
Ok.
Landree 46:09
A little square.
Andrew 46:10
What did- what did you find?
Ned 46:11
Did Detect Magic say anything on that?
Brian 46:13
It is magic.
Ned 46:14
Oh, it is magic.
Landree 46:14
Yeah, it is magic.
Ned 46:14
But Detect Magic doesn't tell you what kind of magic?
Brian 46:16
No.
Ned 46:17
Okay.
Landree 46:17
'It's a small black leather patch that I found inside her chest cavity.'
Ned 46:21
'Can I please see that?'
Landree 46:22
'Yes.'
Ned 46:23
So I take it in my hand.
Brian 46:23
You don't have to look to me, you can just give it to him.
Ned 46:26
So I take it in my head and I can Identify.
Brian 46:28
Okay.
Landree 46:28
I know I didn't know if I trusted him in that moment for some reason.
Brian 46:30
Rituals just-
Ned 46:33
Do not count for slots?
Brian 46:34
No, but they take 10 minutes to do it.
Ned 46:36
Right.
Brian 46:36
You can cast it without spending a slot but it takes you 10 minutes to do it.
Ned 46:40
Time. For sure.
Eddie 46:41
Can you identify more than one thing at once?
Ned 46:43
I detected poisons and then that ritual has happened so I guess we're saying-
Eddie 46:48
No, I'm asking can you, can you identify more than-
Ned 46:50
Oh, I have to- it's whatever I'm touching so I guess I could touch two things and cast Identify.
Brian 46:53
Yeah, if he's going to identify several things he can do it, it just takes him 10 minutes per item.
Ned 46:57
Takes like an hour.
Eddie 46:57
Great.
Ned 47:00
So I could check out that the amulet thing.
Eddie 47:02
I put the ring and the cloak. I don't know if either of these even have any magical properties.
Ned 47:06
Let's Kumbaya circle the shit out of this.
Brian 47:08
Sure. So, the pouch.
Ned 47:11
Yeah.
Brian 47:12
After some time, you try and focus on what this possibly could be because to you it- it almost feels like it has texture. But as you look at it, it's smooth. But as you spend time with the ritual focusing on it, kind of stroking it, massaging it, seeing exactly what it could possibly be, slowly but surely you seem to rub away this sort of magical dust that seems to be covering the item to reveal a blue and black scarab crest of the house Dimir.
Ned 47:46
And was there anything magical about it, like, the specific magic from the Identify?
Brian 47:50
It is magically enchanted in a way that it is only visible. Clearly there is some way that you were able to see it. You using Detect Magic and Identify was able to break that in a particular way.
Ned 48:02
And then the question: can I use it? Cause that's like, one of the things. Like, I would learn how to use it if it's usable by me.
Brian 48:10
It is a Dimir house...
Ned 48:12
Signet .
Brian 48:12
Signet.
Ned 48:13
And the magic is just to reveal the signet?
Brian 48:15
It is magically hidden so that if anyone was to find it-
Ned 48:18
Oh, I'm back to understanding.
Brian 48:19
-just. Yes, it is just a blank patch of leath.
Ned 48:22
Copy, copy. Copy, copy, copy. Thank you.
Brian 48:24
Right, so, unlike many other guilds signets, yours is on your body somewhere, grafted. Many other people carry them.
Ned 48:32
Right.
Brian 48:32
So that you can produce them to affirm you're part of the guild. Rhe house Dimir seem to be taking a great deal of effort to not only hide what they are but where they are.
Ned 48:41
Okay.
Brian 48:42
In fact, it's a little unsettling the fact the only way to identify that this woman was a member of the House Dimir was to pull this plug which killed her.
Ned 48:52
Right.
Brian 48:53
As for the cloak: it is a dirty old cloak.
Eddie 48:58
I throw it out the window.
Brian 48:59
As for the ring...
Ned 49:00
Yep.
Brian 49:02
Roll a D four please.
Ned 49:06
One.
Brian 49:07
What this ring is is- it is a Ring of Charm Person. It is a magic focus that is going to allow vampiric creatures to have an easier time with their mind magic. So once a day, it recharges at the new day, you can cast charm person. Whoever wields the ring.
Ned 49:24
Right.
Andrew 49:25
By the time Lorzatch finishes comparing the two and makes his way downstairs, has the vampire's body completely decayed?
Brian 49:34
Yes. I would say that there is still ash there, but it is a quick acting dissolvent. It's probably just a natural state of undead creatures that there really isn't any moisture here to sustain. You can still make out the frame. There is- it is still there, but at this point it is sort of a shape of dust and it has no clothing because your arrestor or has taken it.
Sarah 49:57
Yeah.
Brian 49:57
So you just see a naked dusty thing.
Ned 50:00
And the arrestor is keeping the ring for your knowledge.
Brian 50:02
Okay.
Andrew 50:02
Lorzatch will take a sample and then rejoin the party upstairs.
Brian 50:06
Sure. In your herbalism kit?
Andrew 50:08
Yup.
Brian 50:08
Great. So you guys make your way back upstairs, look to each other, and sigh as you've had one hell of a night. The house Dimir has shown its face. In what context we don't know. But for now it seems like they were after something that Rufir Alfonso the Third had. A couple of magic items that are available. Couple of new pieces reveal themselves. What would you guys like to do?
Landree 50:32
'Um, Mr. Alfonso, do you have any idea what the House of Dimir would be searching for in your home?'
Brian 50:39
'What wouldn't they be searching for inside of my home? You do see everything that I have here. I happen to have a great deal of money and I happen to have a very nice place that I live in and I happen to have a very nice collection. However, I think the issue at hand here is: what has recently come to my penthouse?'
Landree 51:00
'The fish?'
Brian 51:06
'Oh, my dear. Actually, that is a new piece of a collection, but I'm referring to that orb!'
Andrew 51:13
'I'm afraid we know exactly what the Dimir were after. The vampire poised over your sleeping body was plumbing your mind, hence the headache I imagine you're experiencing now.'
Brian 51:24
'I hope he didn't get any of my safe combination numbers.'
Ned 51:27
'Well, he's dead.' '
Brian 51:28
'Oh, well that's good.'
Andrew 51:29
'It may have been searching for the orb. It may be searching your memories for other actionable intelligence that it might use. For what advantage we can't say.'
Sarah 51:36
'It might just want to know your favorite color, right?'
Brian 51:39
'It's grey, rather morbidly.'
Sarah 51:41
'Really?'
Brian 51:41
'Yes.'
Sarah 51:41
'Mine's red!'
Brian 51:41
'I'm not proud of it at all.'
Sarah 51:44
'Oh.'
Brian 51:45
'I'm sorry. We were trying to have a serious conversation here.'
Andrew 51:48
'We have two bodies, well, four to be precise. With your permission I would keep them-'
Brian 51:53
'Who else is dead?
Andrew 51:54
'Well-'
Brian 51:55
He, like, has not actually left his room yet and he's like, 'What? Oh, the elves! Oh. This has been a night.'
Andrew 52:01
'And with your permission, sir, I would keep these overnight so that we may transport them to the Simic tomorrow to be studied. For, I'm afraid that one of these may still be alive, in a matter of speaking.'
Brian 52:14
'Oh!' You are referring to the?
Andrew 52:16
The one whose plug has not been pulled.
Ned 52:19
Has not been pulled.
Andrew 52:19
'I think it best if we all get some rest before the dawn rises. I will keep watch over these bodies and we will make sure they, uh, see the light of day as it were.'
Brian 52:28
Okay. You guys, after another brief period of time, manage to finally go to sleep. This time out of exhaustion rather than mental turmoil. In the morning, it is still as solemn as it was the night before. You wake up to find Lorzatch sitting quietly over the dead bodies you have managed to make the night before. You get ready to enjoy a breakfast until you realize that the concierges of this establishment lie dead in your room and breakfast is not likely to come. And then on top of that, you remember you have an obligation as you very determinedly booked an appointment with a researcher at the Izzit facility. Where will we go?
This feels like we could potentially kill three birds with one stone if we let the Izzit work on them, but I personally have no interest in the Izzit having a hand in what would be searching a humanoid. So I would suggest we split up.
As a Simic, you know full well that the Izzit will have no interest in dealing with corpses and people.
Ned 53:33
Even if they're House Dimir?
Brian 53:34
Even if they're House Dimir.
Ned 53:36
Oh, okay, great.
Brian 53:36
They work in the physic sciences whereas your guild would be incredibly interested.
Ned 53:41
Then I would suggest we split up.
Brian 53:42
Also you know full well that if you gave them the opportunity, they'd just bumble it up anyway.
Ned 53:48
So yeah, I would suggest we split up.
Brian 53:49
Okay. Interesting.
Ned 53:51
Some to Simic, some to Izzit. We've got an appointment to keep and we shouldn't delay the other one.
Brian 53:54
So very clearly our Simic and Izzit members should pilot the parties. Where would people like to go?
Andrew 54:00
Lorzatch will accompany Parax and deliver the bodies to the Simic Combine.
Brian 54:04
Okay, Fikkara, where would you like to go?
Sarah 54:07
Whoever wants to take me?
Landree 54:11
Yeah. I'd love a little muscle. Please. Thank you.
Sarah 54:13
Okay, sure. Most definitely.
Brian 54:14
And Lennox. Where do you think the Azorius authority would best be suited?
Eddie 54:19
Hmm. Why are we splitting up?
Ned 54:21
Because we have two things we have to do in two different buildings.
Sarah 54:24
We'll cover more ground.
Ned 54:25
Every horror movie ever means that this is aterrible idea, but here we are.
Eddie 54:28
'I'll go wherever I'm needed.'
Brian 54:30
'Well, in my personal opinion, it seems that relations with the Simic are at a pretty good place as of right now. The Izzit have a tendency not to obey the laws of Ravnica if not made to so perhaps these two..' And he kind of, he gestures suggestively to the two...The Izzit and the Boros who maybe shouldn't be left alone.
Landree 55:02
Yes, Zenia 100% staring off into a corner.
Brian 55:05
Yes.
Landree 55:06
She's stopped listening.
Brian 55:07
Yes.
Sarah 55:07
And I'm still trying to get the blood stains out of my tabard.
Brian 55:09
Yes, and the Private First Class seems so instituted in following orders that creating them may not be the best stance for her to take in the party. 'So perhaps for my own comfort, um, you could take charge of this particular situation.'
Eddie 55:25
'Agreed.'
Brian 55:26
'Excellent. Well, then, um, I'm going to stay here and drink as much tea as my body can sustain before being waterlogged. I do wish you the best. And I guess you're off.'
Sarah 55:38
'Are we welcome back?'
Brian 55:39
'Yes, you do work for me, my dear. Let's not forget that.'
Sarah 55:43
'I'm just making sure. There's been a couple times they've told us not to come back.'
Brian 55:47
'Right, well we are anticipating-'
Ned 55:50
'(guffaws)'
Brian 55:50
'I see. I am considering the matter, but for now do what needs to be done and we will consider this protection from a more aggressive stance.'
And so the party does decides to split, heading off into different directions within the compound. The Simic Hybrid Parax, accompanied by the Golgari Lorzatch, decide to carry the bodies of their newly defeated foes back to Zonet 4, hoping that the medical facilities can discern some more clues and provide more answers as to what everyone's role seems to be in the pursuit of this orb. On the other front, Zenia the Izzit scientist is going to take our Boros and Azorius authorities to their designated appointment and inform some very unfortunate second-in-command that their master researcher Malfus Reid is, in fact, several days dead. Until next time, space cowboy.
Next time on Encounter Party! As the danger of Malfus Reid looms overhead, our players scramble to find new allies. With guild war on the horizon, it's time to find out which of their guilds can be trusted. Who or what is hunting this orb? And what of the underground Golgari incursions?

Brian 0:02
Last time, on Encounter Party! Our players managed to escape the death trap of Zonot 4 only to realize they released the terror into the water supply. With the entire compound now on lockdown, our players are trapped deep within Simic territory. As they hunt for clues about the orb, the name of Malphus Reed once again rears its decapitated head. As the clues mount, the question remains: who is a pawn and who is a player? Find out this week, on Encounter Party! Mr. Rufir Alfonso the Third, artificer extraordinaire, purveyor of the ancient and the unknown, stands quaking before you on the remaining half of his train. He is far from the maniacal genius you may have pictured in your mind. In fact, he seems quite frightened because his politeness has been met with extreme aggression. You have managed to find the back half of the rail engine that you guys discovered on the Boros line outside of the Simic compound. The interior is just as empty, except for the fact that it is not trashed to bits. It seems to have been emptied deliberately by this one singular man, Mr. Rufir Alfonso the Third. He's a little bit intimidated, considering the fact that he feels like he was trying to extend some sort of courtesy and have a civil conversation, and the five of you have literally kicked in his door and are demanding information.
Sarah 1:42
What? Why are you looking at me?
Landree 1:44
To be fair, I complimented his mustache.
Brian 1:47
Despite your demeanor, Mr. Alfonso does continue to exhibit this politeness and invites you onto the train. There are some places to sit down. Inside, it's very luxurious. It's akin to what you found on the front half of the train over on the other end of the compound. Except this one hasn't been ransacked. It looks like it was designed to be a mobile showcase, okay, there are display cases in wall mounts. Although at this point, everything has been emptied and you caught Mr. Alfonso in the process of cleaning everything out from a now-derelict train.
Sarah 2:20
I'll stand.
Andrew 2:21
Lorzatch will take a seat and is looking through his backpack.
Landree 2:26
Zenia just starts going through his boxes.
Brian 2:27
Your backpack, or...?
Andrew 2:28
His own backpack.
Brian 2:29
Your own backpack.
Andrew 2:30
And is pulling out the mess kit which contains a thing.
Brian 2:32
Okay.
Landree 2:33
Zenia starts going through Mr. Alfonso, Alfonso's boxes without asking for permission.
Brian 2:38
He sees you but makes no attempt to stop you. Inside you find a lot of old artifacts, archaeological finds. You do happen to see one spot that has like a categorical note attached to it suggesting that it is from before the days of the Guildpact even existing. So that would be like over 10,000 years old. What is everybody else doing?
Ned 3:01
I'm standing at the back. I am-- this is not my conversation.
Brian 3:03
I will say that, Lennox, your presence seems to be the most uneasing to him because you are clearly displaying the authority of the Azorius. And while he is not guild aligned, that does put him sort of in the direct-- even though he is not guild aligned, that means that his direct legal authority would be the Azorius guild itself and he does the best he can to break the tension with nervous energy. And he's, 'Ah--'
Eddie 3:29
'Tell us what you know about the orb that you sent your goons to retrieve.'
Brian 3:33
'The orb, yes. What do you know about that orb?'
Eddie 3:37
'I'm asking you what you know about it.'
Brian 3:39
'Have you seen it?'
Andrew 3:40
'We have,' and Lorzatch will open the mess kit which contains it.
Brian 3:44
'Oh, well, that's a bit of relief, I suppose.'
Sarah 3:48
I suppose.
Andrew 3:48
'This was stolen from you, correct?'
Brian 3:50
'Yes.'
Andrew 3:51
'And it was Mr. Gato and a number of associates who were sent to retrieve it?'
Brian 3:56
'Yes, that's quite right, Mr. Gato is under my employment. Wow, you do seem to have a great deal more information than I do. May I make a request? Before we begin to ask me questions I may not be able to answer without physical harm, could you tell me how you possibly came into possession of that, which is technically owned by me?'
Andrew 4:14
'Our understanding is that this was unearthed by a Simic excavation party.'
Brian 4:20
'Yes.'
Andrew 4:20
'Sold to you.'
Brian 4:21
'Oh no, they gave it.'
Andrew 4:23
'I see. After it came into your possession, a person stole it from you where they absconded to the 34th Precinct of the Boros Legion, entered a tavern known as the Leg End, tried to pawn it off to the barkeep, was intercepted by one Mr. Gato and associates sent by you to recover the artifact, where they embroiled us in an armed conflict. The artifact went from our possession to one Lavinia or someone posing as her, who is, according to the Master Biomancer of the Simic, a Dimir operative merely assuming her identity.'
Brian 5:00
'Oh my.'
Andrew 5:01
'This orb was then placed in the comatose body of one Elazia, no surname, who, brought into the medical facility run by the Simic Combine, may or may not have proven to be a catalyst for a pervasive infection in the form of an adaptive krasis resembling the same black goo that was found at the original excavation site.'
Brian 5:24
'Fascinating. And you were a part of all of this?'
Sarah 5:27
'Yes.'
Brian 5:28
'I'm very impressed. This is great story.'
Sarah 5:31
'We lost one of our own.'
Brian 5:32
'Oh.'
Sarah 5:33
'Many Simic have died.'
Andrew 5:35
'The question--'
Brian 5:35
'Oh.'
'What a tragedy.'
Andrew 5:36
'that I pose to you.'
Brian 5:37
'Yes.'
Andrew 5:38
'Firstly, do you know what this artifact is? And what it is capable of doing?'
Brian 5:45
'Oh, yes, I have done a great deal of research and study on it. And I can say with extreme confidence that I have absolutely no idea what it is. I'm sorry, that's not very helpful is it? When I was summoned here by the Master Biomancer of Zonot 4, they released this item into my care having no idea what it was. And unfortunately, none of my research or reference gave any clues to what this object possibly could be. I was simply going to make something up for the showcase. Perhaps it was the result of an experiment gone wrong or, or perhaps it contained to the soul of an ancient demon or-- I'm sorry, I'm getting a bit carried away. As far as its disappearance, it became quite clear that one of Mr. Gato's security detail possibly could have taken it and so he was dispatched to locate this individual and retrieve the orb, but I haven't seen him since. So I do thank you a great deal for bringing it back to my possession. Sorry to disappoint. It doesn't seem to be anything quite extraordinary.'
Andrew 6:43
'May I ask what happened to your train?'
Brian 6:44
'That is a very peculiar question. I do not stay here. I have quite a nice room that I am renting from the Izzet residential areas. My train was put here permanently, it was a bit of an exchange. And one morning, this half was simply gone. In the equation, I'm trapped here. One night, went to bed, left my belongings, woke up the next day, messenger came and told me that half my train was gone.'
Andrew 7:12
'We found it, incidentally.'
Brian 7:14
'Yes, I'd heard that there is evidence of its retrieval. Might I ask where it is?'
Andrew 7:19
'The Boros line on the way back to the precinct.'
'We happened to encounter Mr. Gato and a number of personnel who I believe comprised your security team.'
Brian 7:23
'Oh!'
'I take it he has not yet recovered the orb, then.'
Sarah 7:32
'I don't think he'll be doing any sort of recovering anytime soon.'
Ned 7:35
'Quick reminder: the orb is here in this room.'
Brian 7:39
'Yes, I understand that. I was questioning why it came back with you and not the men who are under my employ for not a small amount of money.'
Andrew 7:48
'There was a rather aggressive infection that seems to have swept through a number of your... we'll say ""former"" personnel.'
Brian 7:55
He takes like a very cautious step back at the word of infection and you get the sense that there's a bit of... 'ew.' Like, in his manner.
Eddie 8:03
I cast insight. I mean, not cast. I'm gonna roll for Insight.
Brian 8:07
Yes, please.
Eddie 8:08
Because I want to know if I, I feel like he's telling the truth.
Brian 8:11
Sure.
Sarah 8:11
Nobody was that kind of voice can be lying. Nobody with that voice can be lying.
Brian 8:16
Based on what you rolled, nobody would that voice could be lying. As far as you can tell, he's telling you the truth.
Eddie 8:20
I'm going to go ahead and cast Zone of Truth.
Brian 8:24
Would you please elaborate as to what that spell is going to do for those...
Eddie 8:28
Because I'm casting spells and shit.
Well, he's going to go ahead and roll a Charisma saving throw.
Brian 8:37
Okay, and if he fails?
Eddie 8:38
He's going to tell us anything we ask him.
Brian 8:41
Now, Zone of Truth, does it create a--
Eddie 8:43
It's a 15-foot radius.
Brian 8:45
Okay.
Eddie 8:46
Um...
Brian 8:46
The train itself is 10 feet wide, the car.
Eddie 8:49
Yeah, so I mean, just like anything with it, it doesn't. I don't think--
Brian 8:52
A zone large enough that if he starts perhaps making an exit from that area, you're going to know like, hey.
Ned 8:59
Does it affect us?
Eddie 8:59
Yeah.
Brian 9:01
Is he aware of-- Oh, yeah, that's the other question.
Ned 9:04
Is it all creatures or is it creatures of your choice? Because I am standing behind you.
Eddie 9:09
Creatures my choice.
Brian 9:10
Okay.
Eddie 9:10
So okay, until the spell ends, the creature enters the spell's... (reading through rapidly) On a failed save, the creature can't speak a deliberate lie within the radius.
Brian 9:18
He rolled a 10.
Eddie 9:20
He's going to tell us what the fuck we want to know.
Brian 9:22
Surprisingly, he actually like immediately knows what's going on. And he goes, 'Ah, well done. Yes, sorry to disappoint you, though. But I have no cause to lie here. I am, as calm as I may appear, quite afraid of that large horned woman over there at the entrance.'
Eddie 9:40
'As well you should be.'
'She likes to stick people with them.'
Sarah 9:41
'Thank you.'
Brian 9:44
'Yes. I don't doubt that. I am telling you the truth. And as you can tell, my security team seems to no longer be under my employment.'
Sarah 9:54
'Or anyone's. I mean, they are under something.'
Brian 9:58
'Ground.'
Sarah 9:59
'Yes.'
Brian 9:59
'Yes. Oh.'
Andrew 10:01
'And you were not present when they absconded or were displaced with the other half of your train?'
Brian 10:07
'They had already left.'
Andrew 10:08
'So we do not know the origin of the infection that seems to have taken them.'
Brian 10:12
'No, my train had disappeared I believe during the time of the festival if I can pinpoint it.'
Eddie 10:17
'Who are the other people--'
Brian 10:19
'I suppose I just assumed it was some sort of revelry prank. The Izzet are capable of more than they appear,' and he kind of gestures to Zenia, like...
Sarah 10:27
Winky winky.
Brian 10:28
Those... scientists.
Eddie 10:30
'You mentioned other people were showing interest in this orb. Who are they?'
Brian 10:33
'Well, as I perhaps insinuated a little less bluntly than intended, directly after receiving this orb-- Oh my, oh, perhaps this is more dangerous than I thought. After the Simic had presented me with this orb and given me the opportunity to study it as I do, purveyor of the ancient and unknown, artifacts, magical items and the such--'
Ned 10:53
We get it.
Brian 10:54
'Yes, sorry, carrying on. An Izzet man came to me within two days of me acquiring the item, offering me a great deal of money. He must have had some connection with the Simic to even know that it came to me, but he seemed quite insistent that I presented it to him.'
Eddie 11:09
'Did he identify himself?'
Brian 11:11
'There was no mistaking who this man was. It was the head researcher, Malphus Reed. It seemed very peculiar to me. I'm not entirely a big fan of the Izzet. Sorry, my dear. But their science is a bit reckless and damaging.'
Landree 11:25
'Compliment taken, thank you.'
Brian 11:27
'Yes, quite. I found it necessary to hire a security team, of which I employed Mr. Gato, a well known private security enterprise, and everything seemed to be working out in protection. And it wasn't until that one member of their team decided that perhaps it was just more profitable for him to take this item that I had made very clear I do not know what it is-- pardon the cuss, but that buffoon has taken a great deal of money from me.'
Andrew 11:52
'Mr. Gato did retrieve the thief in question, did he bring him back into your presence?'
Brian 11:58
'I have not seen Mr. Gatp since I sent him to retrieve the orb.'
Andrew 12:01
'It would seem to follow that if they regrouped at the train, the thief is still very much on the loose and may or may not have been the catalyst responsible for that particular infection.'
Brian 12:13
'I don't know about the rest of you, but it is approaching the mid day. I myself am quite hungry, perhaps we could come to some sort of an arrangement to prevent myself from getting hoofed or horned.'
Sarah 12:24
'Oh, I, you're good.'
Brian 12:25
'Okay, I am now very concerned that the people who may have been after this orb are taking bolder and bolder measures to get it. I am glad that I have it. And there is a part of me that believes that it should remain in my possession. More importantly, now I'm concerned that the wrong people may get their hands on it. But as you can see, I no longer have a security team. So perhaps, as we search for particular answers and defend against whoever intends to misuse this item, someone out there seems to know what it is. And unfortunately, that person is not me. We are stuck here for the moment. And perhaps with a bit of coinage, I might convince you to play on my side for a bit.'
Eddie 13:03
'What is it you are asking of us?'
Brian 13:05
'Purely for a security detail. I happen to have a rather nice place to stay. Say, 200 zinos a week?'
Eddie 13:11
'Let's say 250.'
Sarah 13:13
'Mr. Alfonso--'
Brian 13:14
'Did not expect the authorities to be such hard bargainers. If you would please do me the kindness of making a Persuasion roll to see whether or not I accept such an egregiously over-generous offer...'
Eddie 13:26
16.
Brian 13:27
I think a 16 is good enough. He says, 'Yes, quite. Well then, let's say you better be worth the extra 50.' (laughter)
Sarah 13:35
(laughter) I do laugh.
Brian 13:40
'Yes. Um, well, if you would do me the kindness of carrying a couple of these boxes and I can take us somewhere where we can relax?'
Sarah 13:49
'Certainly, sir.'
Brian 13:50
So he kind of hands you guys a couple of boxes, perhaps maybe more than you intended to carry. They're just small things, who knows what's in them, but you manage to escort to him in a sense and... I don't think it matters. You follow Mr. Alfonso up into what may be considered the residential area of the compound. Mostly apartments, very few what you would consider permanent residences. It is sort of a workplace extension. There are a few restaurants, there may be a few eateries or bars, no real shops, no real commerce. It is a place you go when you're done working. At the very forefront of this part of the compound, however, there is a very tall and very pristine building run by a pair of elf concierges. Mr. Alfonso proudly gestures that he happens to be staying at the top of that building and ushers you into what is a well to do lobby, well above the pay grade that you could ever hope to experience on your current career paths. You are all shuffled into the elevator as the concierges give a nice tip of the hat to Mr. Alfonso. 'Ah, Mr. Alfonso, hello.' 'Oh, hello, hello, good to see you. Lovely day.' And in a very short, quiet and awkward elevator ride up, the doors open into what is a very large and very gorgeous penthouse suite. Rufir turns to all of you as if you've been longtime friends and says, 'Welcome! This is where I'm staying during our current, from what I hear, quarantine. So please make your selves at home. There's a great deal of beds over there in that room that I'm currently not using. And when you're ready, I will call for some food. And perhaps you can tell me exactly why you happen to be quite so upset with me.'
Ned 15:34
We took our long rest, right? We aren't in need of any rest.
Brian 15:37
You're not in need of any rest. But if you, if you look off to the right there, there is a room with several beds that you guys can kind of place your... you guys can place your things in. In the center room leading in, there's a staircase that leads sort of down into the room that you can see there that-- it's a big, wide open area. The whole front of this penthouse is windows that sort of shows out on to the, the entirety of the compound. You are, aside from parts of the Izzet Research Center, the power plant, you are the tallest part in the compound right now. And not only can you see sweepingly across just about everywhere, but you also get kind of a decent half look down in the well.
Andrew 16:21
Is this the master bedroom over here?
Brian 16:23
That is his facility that at the current moment is locked, like, there is a closed door there that he disappears into briefly and then comes back out and says he made a quick call downstairs for some food and sits at that large communal table there in the center of the room. As you kind of get yourself settled and get your things, claim certain beds, take a moment to talk, you know, negotiate sleeping space, and then during that time period, some food will come up. A nice, pretty decent spread. For some of you, perhaps in the Boros Legion, may be nicer than you've ever seen. Lorzatch, depending on your particular diet, you may not find anything here that you like, but there are, you know, we are in a Simic facility. So there's going to be, you know, algae, seaweed, kelp, that sort of thing. Some fish, no beef, but there's probably stuff that you can eat if you have an adventurous enough appetite. As for the rest of you, it's quite good. Mr. Alfonso himself makes several pots of tea, leaves them out for you to partake at your own choice, does take a cup himself.
Sarah 17:29
Is it lovely tea?
Brian 17:31
I mean, he's enjoying it. It's good.
Sarah 17:32
This is lovely tea, Mr. Alfonso.
Brian 17:34
'Oh, thank you very much. Glad you're enjoying it. Perhaps you could all try and relax as much as I am trying to right now.'
Andrew 17:41
'How did one Mr. Gato come into your employ, Mr. Alfonso?'
Brian 17:45
'Oh, he's not quite as obscure as you would think. He's quite good. There are several private security enterprises here in the city of Ravnica and not everyone chooses to deal in the guild business. Bit nasty if you ask me. I have relationships with the Izzet and I have relationships with the Simic, purely on a research basis. I actually prefer to spend a great deal of my time in the Selesnyan conclaves. They're really nice people and share an interest in ancient history the way that I do, but getting your hands on a security team is simply based on reputation. I know people who have known people who have used him. Mr. Gato was never the problem. It's just whoever this miscreant was that decided he wanted to steal my item.'
Andrew 18:31
'And was this an independent contractor or did he come with Mr. Gato's company?'
Brian 18:36
'He was one of Mr. Gato's men, from what I understand.'
Andrew 18:38
'I see.' Lorzatch does pour himself a cup of tea.
Brian 18:42
'I do specifically remember that this man told me he was going to take a day or two off, that he was sick. From the way that he said it, Mr. Gato... and it just seemed normal. People get sick. People take days off. Didn't seem a problem.'
Landree 18:57
'When you were studying the orb for two months. How did you handle it?'
Brian 19:03
'Well, I did find very quickly, as you might have well known by carrying in that box, that is a bit painful to the touch. Step number one, don't touch it with your bare hands. But the curious thing about the orb from my instance is that I found no records or information in any of my studies that could possibly have suggested what it is, or more importantly, what it does. There are no markings, no carvings, no tool marks, no evidence as to how it was made. It is almost a pure creation of metal. Am I making myself clear? It seems the only way to achieve such perfection as if it created itself.'
Andrew 19:47
'Are you aware of any kind of phenomena that would have separated one half of your train from the other?'
Brian 19:52
'No, I'm trying to decide how concerned about that idea I should be. I do not really interact with the Izzet since Mr. Malphus Reed came so urgently to try and acquire that orb from me. I really have no idea what he possibly could have wanted it for, or what he thought it could have been for. Perhaps he thought it might have been some iteration of that mizzium they're always messing with but, when a man of the level of Malphus Reed comes knocking at your door and wants something from you-- particularly wants something from Mr. Rufir Alfonso the Third-- my immediate concern is that he's going to blow himself or someone else up. This is all a bit disappointing, I understand, since I am a foremost authority on the ancient and the unknown. (satisfied chuckle) Quite.
'The more confusing thing is not only not knowing what a new thing is, is how we all start. But having no reference with which to gauge it against is quite another thing. We are talking about a physically perfect piece of indiscernible metal. I have run many tests on it. I have not been able to mar it. I've not been able to break it. I've not been able to dent it. I've not been able to melt it. It is very cold to the touch. And yet it doesn't freeze the air around it. It is, in itself, a near perfect homeostasis of metal.'
Eddie 21:21
'Well, it seems it has something to do with these corrupted people.'
Brian 21:25
'Yes, you did bring that up before. You know, there was a bit of information that slipped when I was talking to the biomancer. When she initially called me in to address this, Vizarra did sort of let slip that it was not the only thing found, that this orb was found along with something else. I never inquired. I don't think she meant to hide it. But she certainly didn't make any indication of volunteering any information as to what it was found with, but I do know that whatever it was found with, was of the interest to the Simic.'
Eddie 21:58
'It was found with a tentacle of some kind.'
Brian 22:01
'Oh, please do go on.'
Sarah 22:04
'Black viscous organic matter. That's really all we know about it.'
Andrew 22:07
'The kind that later consumed the device in question and began wreaking havoc throughout the facility.'
Brian 22:13
'And this somehow was the cause of all that catastrophe that just happened?'
Andrew 22:20
'Very much so.'
Brian 22:21
'Strange. So this orb was located down into the depths of the well, in the underground ocean, along with a piece of a tentacle, perhaps a part of something that once was alive.'
Eddie 22:34
'Or perhaps still is.'
Brian 22:36
'Oh, what a frightening thought. Exciting. Well, my fair fine travelers, it seems that you are currently under employment for the near future, at least. What resources or help might I provide?'
Eddie 22:48
'We came up against a foe that bested us. If there was any equipment that we could perhaps use?'
Brian 22:58
'Ah, yes. I was expecting the conversation to go that way very shortly. I do have in my possession a great many of items. As of right now, I think considering that we've negotiated an extra 50 zinos a week, that we are adequately compensated for the time being. But should the situation arise, where you need to be outfitted more responsibly, we can have that conversation then. And I do warn you: I would not attempt to go snooping around this facility. Because there are a great many things I carry here that are dangerous and reactive.' And he kind of looks at you, Zenia, and is like 'you might like your body parts where they are.' So let's see if you can rein in your curiosity for the sake of self preservation.
Landree 23:46
Alright...
Brian 23:47
So you guys have a temporary base of operations, a safe place to hang out. You seem to have a great resource in Rufir. And it seems that there has been some sort of connection with this Malphus Reed.
Andrew 24:03
So it seems to me that even if we were able to lift the quarantine on Zonot 4 and all the adjoining settlements, that it poses a major risk of letting this adaptive black substance back into the water supply and endanger the rest of Ravnica. So it seems to me that we are going to be drawn into conflict with this thing and make sure that it's put down for good before we can, with any kind of good conscience, lift the quarantine and get the pump station running again.
Ned 24:41
'Izzet, can you get us into Malphus Reed's labs?'
Landree 24:44
'Not that I care that much, but I do have a name. So if you want something from me, you can always ask a little more politely.'
Ned 24:50
What's your name?
'It's Zenia.'
'Zenia, can you get us into Malphus Reed's labs?'
Landree 24:54
'I can certainly try.'
Sarah 24:56
'Zenia, would there be anybody besides Malphus Reed who might know what he's doing? Like, does he have an assistant or anything similar to that?'
Landree 25:04
'I'm certain that he would, of course, there's certainly, I mean, anyone that high up in the Izzet has plenty of assistants.'
Andrew 25:11
'The director of the pump station was reporting directly to Malphus Reed. It is possible that she would have more information.'
Landree 25:18
Vizarra?
Andrew 25:19
'Not the biomancer, the director of the pump station.'
Landree 25:22
'Yes, yes, maybe we should return to her.'
Sarah 25:24
'And then afterwards, we could talk to Vizarra and see what kind of precautionary measures they have available to us in order to destroy the monster for good.'
Landree 25:36
'Well, I think we need to figure out what we're working with and I think we need to murder it. I don't think there's any-- I completely agree-- there's no leaving or lifting the quarantine.'
Andrew 25:44
There is a research facility, which Alfonso seems convinced that they don't have any kind of useful information to offer about the nature of the orb. I still think it could be worth checking. But we do have at least one authority figure at the pump station who might be able to point us in the direction of something that Malphus Reed knew before he died.
Sarah 26:07
Right.
Landree 26:08
And I also agree that, that there would be worth in going to the research center also because, like, what kind of authority or expertise does he actually have other than...?
Andrew 26:18
Alfonso?
Landree 26:18
Yeah.
Andrew 26:19
Apparently none.
Landree 26:19
A wealthy man, exactly, who collects shiny things. I don't really take him at, you know...
Brian 26:24
So where would we like to head? Keep in mind, it's after lunchtime.
Sarah 26:28
Um, I agree with seeing Izzet, 'cuz--
Brian 26:30
So going back to the pump station?
Andrew 26:33
The pump station.
Ned 26:33
The pump station feels like the way to go.
Andrew 26:34
Because we have a person that we know we can talk to that might be of greater use than just flying blindly into somewhere else.
Landree 26:41
Agreed.
AD BREAK
Brian 27:18
So you guys march yourselves back down to the pump station. What was that horribly noisy, bombastic facility is now stupidly quiet. And you can feel the anxious energy of a crowd full of Izzet employees who have nothing to do. The potential energy inside of this place is a bomb waiting to go off, as the fidgety Izzet goblins just sort of sit around waiting for 'what are we supposed to do with ourselves?' They check the gauges for the fortieth time in the last three minutes. They check the pipelines, they're checking seals, they're checking with each other to see whether or not this quarantine is over, and during all of this they spot you five coming back through again and, seeing how angrily the Azorius arrester and the Boros legionnaire marched their way through there last time, they are keen to give you the space you desire. You march yourself right, straight back to where you did the first time, where you see that Vedalken angrily telling off another goblin: 'I have no idea what's going on. I'm just as mad as you are.' And then she spots you coming in and, like so many other people currently in the city of Ravnica, she rolls her eyes.
'You are back. Can I turn the pumps back on now please?'
Landree 28:43
'No. Not unless you'd like to potentially murder the rest of the city.'
Brian 28:47
'Oh yes, it is very scary. I heard you tell me this before. Now what do you want?'
Landree 28:52
'First of all, I'd love to know your name. So I know that who I'm speaking to.'
Brian 28:56
'I am supervisor Yadira. I am the head of this pump station. And who are you, low-level researcher?'
Landree 29:03
'You are correct. I am low-level research. My name is Zenia, I work in the storms and electricity lab. We are--'
Brian 29:09
'You are a far place from home.'
Landree 29:11
'This is true. I did not intend to come out this far. But here I am.'
Brian 29:15
The Izzet guild is a very cliquey, very cutthroat guild within each other because there is limited money, and different laboratories and different scientific focuses compete with each other for the focus of the Firemind to care.
Landree 29:31
'We are looking for a little bit more information. Malphus Reed-- '
Brian 29:35
'Yes.'
Landree 29:36
'--Master Researcher-- was searching for this particular orb that has come into our possession.'
Brian 29:42
'I know nothing about this.'
Landree 29:43
'Do you have any contact with an assistant of his that we might be able to speak with?'
Brian 29:48
'Master Researcher Malphus Reed is the head of this division of hydroelectric power for the Izzet guild. He is not here. Yes, apparently he's dead now. So, sorry for him. People die in the Izzet guild all the time. This is not a new thing. He probably blew himself up because he didn't set his safety protocol.'
Sarah 30:08
'Actually, he was cut into pieces by a murder circus.'
Brian 30:12
'Oh, that is a bit worse of a way to go.'
Sarah 30:14
'Yes.'
Andrew 30:15
'Does he have an office on the premises?'
Brian 30:18
'Yes, he has an office. It is that giant building up there.'
Sarah 30:21
'Do we have your permission to enter it? Please?'
Brian 30:23
'You-- I cannot give you permission to enter it. I do not belong to the research facility. I am the supervisor of the pump station.'
Sarah 30:31
'Can you lead us to someone who would be able to give us permission?'
Brian 30:35
'I am not a concierge! I am the supervisor of the pump station! My job is here, waiting for you to end this quarantine so we can get back to work! Do you see these goblins--'
Sarah 30:46
'I am asking nicely!'
Brian 30:48
Oh, Intimidation check. Love it. With advantage. That was awesome.
Sarah 30:56
'I'm trying to be nice!'
Gonna be like a 23.
Brian 31:04
She just like loses all sass, right? She's just like, the idea now of her getting, like, torn limb from limb in the way that Malphus might have gone has kinda like shut her up. And she's like, 'Even your little Izzet researcher should know that you have to go to the office. You have to file a claim. You have to book an appointment. We are very busy.'
Sarah 31:25
'I understand and that's why we're trying to get out of your way.'
Brian 31:28
'This is the pump station. We are not part of the research facility. That is Malphus Reed's own building. He is in charge there. He is not in charge here. He is just in charge of me.'
Eddie 31:41
'We appreciate your help.'
'Thank you very much.'
Sarah 31:42
'Thank you, Yadira.'
Brian 31:43
You can see her just kind of like twitching with, like, 'I have nothing to fucking do but get yelled at.'
Sarah 31:49
'I think that pipe might be leaking.'
Brian 31:51
'Oh no!' And she, like, like, calls two goblins to like run up the thing and check. Yeah, she's completely like (gasp of panic).
Sarah 32:10
I found a new game.
Oh.
Andrew 32:12
So then we journey on towards the research facility?
Eddie 32:14
Yes.
Brian 32:15
Yes. So the research facility is rather intimidating. One of the frightening things about Izzet guild structures is that no one ever seemed to bother calling any sort of safety commission or zoning board. These buildings just kind of look like while they were going up, they got another idea.
Like, we're gonna put a door here, but before we do that, how about a pipe?
It looks like everything is in its place and they know exactly what goes where and what does what. But that's only knowledge available to whoever put it there. Everything kind of steams, everything kind of creaks, it seems like the building itself is like: 'What did you do? Why is this here? What am I supposed to do with this part of me?' And there is so much energy, it's exhausting just being around an Izzet facility. People don't move at anything less than basically a half run, but there is what looks to be a check-in area, some sort of counter, behind which sits a very, very busy-looking goblin in a very, very big hat that has a very large and unnecessary number of lenses attached to it, as she is rifling through a ton of papers behind a very deliberately placed iron grate.
Sarah 33:47
Is there sides to this grate, or just the grate in front?
Brian 33:51
No, it's just like a counter with a window.
Sarah 33:53
Oh, okay, I just pictured just the grate in front of her on a desk without anything else.
Brian 33:58
No, she's behind a grate. As in you can't just grab her and reach her.
Sarah 34:03
Oh, what...
Brian 34:04
Which is probably what happens all the time. Otherwise, people would be like, 'listen here, you.'
Sarah 34:10
That wasn't my plan.
Brian 34:11
Head down, her Jamiroquai hat kind of bobbles back and forth as she looks like she's rifling through some stuff.
Landree 34:18
Zenia feels very comfortable and very energized by everything going on. This is definitely comforting to her and she approaches this woman and she says, 'I'm so sorry to bother you. I know that you're incredibly busy.'
Brian 34:32
'Hmm? Yes? What?'
Landree 34:33
'We are looking for an assistant of Malphus Reed.'
Brian 34:37
'Oh, are you now? Well, let me just stop exactly what it is I'm doing and help you.'
Landree 34:41
'I'd like it if you did that. Thank you.'
Brian 34:44
She, like, looks up over the thing and rolls her eyes at you like, like, like, that the charm and the deftness of that was so smooth, that she's just sort of, like, put off and now has no choice but to engage with you. And she's like, 'Who are you?'
Landree 35:01
'I'm Zenia. We have been sent. We're a team from the 34th District.'
Brian 35:05
'And?'
Landree 35:05
'And we are looking for-- we are looking for someone who can help us. We have in our possession a very, very dangerous item that Malphus Reed was searching for himself.'
Brian 35:18
'Ooh. Might I take a look at it please?'
Sarah 35:20
'No.'
Brian 35:22
'Forget you then, bovine.'
Sarah 35:23
(indignant gasp)
Brian 35:25
'So I'm sorry. Backtrack here. Now that I remember what my job is. Oh, yes. I don't know you. You're not from this facility. You wear our guild insignia, yes?'
Landree 35:35
'Yes.' And I display it.
Brian 35:37
'Yes. Thank you. Do speed up. I am dying by the minute.'
Landree 35:41
'I know, I've been with these people for so long. I have been going at half pace for a while. I apologize.'
'He's dead.'
Brian 35:45
'Thank you very much for the proper respect. So now, you hold something in your possession that is dangerous. Oh, I'm quite scared now. And you want me to just-- ""Oh, let me just call upstairs and summon Master Researcher Malphus Reed to come down and bestow upon you his very precious time.""'
She's just kind of like, just kind of like stops in her, stops in her ramble. Like, it's, it seems like we're getting in a rhythm of how to make Izzet people just shut the hell up. She just, kind of, 'What what what?'
Landree 36:18
'Yes, he's dead. He's a torso now. So we need to speak with someone associated with him.'
Brian 36:23
'Wh-- what? How? What?'
Sarah 36:25
'Rakdos.'
Brian 36:26
'Oh. Oh. Ew.'
Sarah 36:28
'Yeah.'
Brian 36:28
'Oh, this is terrible. This is very, very bad news.'
Sarah 36:31
'We're investigating his death.'
Brian 36:33
Oh, um, I suppose we better book an appointment with, ah... Researcher Sen then. When would be an appropriate time?'
Landree 36:39
'Now.'
Brian 36:39
'Um, yes, well.'
Sarah 36:42
'Please.'
Brian 36:42
'Now is not really something that we cater to--'
Ned 36:45
I cast Mage Hand through the grate and just have it tap its fingers right in front of her.
Brian 36:49
'Yes. Lovely trick.' She picks up a folder just goes (sound of a folder slapping the ghostly hand) and just, like, whacks it, like (more slapping)
'Ah, yes. Unless that's holding a sprocket, I'm not really turned on. The unfortunate thing here is there is no possible way that I could possibly get you into see Researcher Sen at this exact moment because she's not exactly on site. However, if Malphus Reed is, in fact, dead, well, that is something that needs to be addressed immediately. Um, how can we contact you?'
Landree 37:22
'Well, we're staying with Mr. Alfonso currently in his penthouse.'
Brian 37:29
'Ew.'
Landree 37:30
'Agreed.'
Brian 37:30
And she kind of turns her lip up, like, 'ehh.'
Landree 37:34
'Yes.'
Brian 37:34
'What a boring man.'
Landree 37:35
'Agreed.'
Brian 37:36
'Okay, what is your name?'
Landree 37:39
'Zenia.'
Brian 37:39
'Zenia, do you have your credentials on you, please?'
Landree 37:42
'Of course.'
Brian 37:42
You would, you would always be able to. It's sort of like a hand resume that-- so you present your resume.
Landree 37:47
Absolutely.
Brian 37:49
'Okay, please understand that this is something I'm going to take very, very seriously. For now. I will leave this message and hopefully tomorrow morning, Second Researcher Sen will be able to come and then we can have this very serious conversation. As for right now, well, we need to confirm.'
Andrew 38:07
Is there any chance of searching his office?
Landree 38:10
Meaning like, getting into it or asking her?
Andrew 38:12
Yeah, it's not like we need an appointment.
Brian 38:12
You would know that trying to break into an Izzet facility...
Andrew 38:18
I mean, they can open a door.
Landree 38:20
Right.
Andrew 38:21
And it's not like we're disturbing any of the work that's happening.
Landree 38:23
That's true.
Brian 38:24
Rifling through another researcher's things is so in the wrong that it's like begging for death. It's not that people don't do it. But if you get caught doing it. Another person's lab is a minefield, you don't know what they're working on. You don't know what they have. You don't know how dangerous it is. It's always going to be dangerous. You don't know what codes they have in place. You don't know if they've coded their research. There are just a thousand things that people have to do to protect themselves because somebody discovering your work or stealing your work is literally a matter of life or death with the Izzet. It's not like, 'Oh, hey, let me copy your notes.' It's like, 'Oh, shit, you've made that breakthrough. Well, now I've made that breakthrough. I've curried favor with the dragon and you're exploded. Or disintegrated.'
Sarah 39:13
That's how you--
Brian 39:13
Or frozen. Or burnt. Or shocked to death.
Sarah 39:16
Okay.
Brian 39:17
Or dismembered.
Sarah 39:18
Alright, dismemberment is the Rakdos. We've already covered that.
Brian 39:22
Depends on what you're building.
Sarah 39:23
Point.
Landree 39:24
I, the, I-- this is not said in front of her. But I'm perfectly comfortable at least sneaking around. I know that there would be danger involved. But no, I don't think they would let us...
Brian 39:34
Give me a Perception check.
Landree 39:36
Maybe it would help. It's 5.
Brian 39:38
It doesn't take much to realize that the only way into this facility is one of two massively locked doors to either side of this woman. This is not a facility that you storm. This is a facility that sounds like tomorrow, you might get an audience with somebody pretty important. And trying to mess with an Izzet facility is like begging for a missing hand.
Sarah 39:58
But we can still talk to Vizarra, the master biomancer, if she's available, to see what kind of weaponry or et cetera that we need to defeat the monster because I can't imagine they'd have an experiment that they couldn't destroy permanently.
Landree 39:58
Okay.
But there's value, there's value in speaking with whoever is creating these hybrids as well. I mean, this seems like, this seems like a potential creation of theirs. And at the very least, we might be able to find out some more information about what they're doing that they, that either left their mind, they didn't think to share with us.
Andrew 40:29
So then it's worth going back to the Simic and seeing what they have to say.
Landree 40:34
I think so.
Brian 40:35
But also your current new addition to your party has a great deal of basic knowledge. He is involved in the zonot.
Landree 40:42
Oh, sure.
Sarah 40:43
Oh, yeah, that's right. You're not Brevin.
Landree 40:45
Brevin died.
Sarah 40:46
Yeah, I know.
Landree 40:46
Yeah. 'What do you know about any of this? Do you know anything about the orb? Do you have any experience with these, these creatures that are this black ichor-like substance?'
Brian 40:58
You would know some basic things about the zonot. Experiments. What that creature was down at the bottom that they fought was simply labeled as Experiment 27. It was a krasis mutation, where this is one of the things that the Simic does, especially those who are adaptionists, like the Zonot 4 are, you were basically developing a new organism and testing abilities to give it and, you know, considering what these adaptations are useful for. Some of these experiments are used nowadays to kind of help guinea-pig some useful skills or grafts that you intend to add to your soldiers. The fact that-- the way that they describe this, the fact that it somehow became corrupted or fused with whatever this black thing is, is not what was intended for that experiment.
Landree 41:48
It fused with the black.
Brian 41:50
You are, you know that these things exist. But the, the thing that was such a concern is that anyone in the science community knew that that black tendril was found with the orb. And it's all known pretty easily, unless you're sort of like within the guard, that hey, we found this cool shit. We gave this orb to Rufir Alfonso, because he's a historian, and you guys don't give a shit about metal. But the tentacle you have was kind of in stasis, people were examining it. Nobody was doing experiments on the tentacle, they were simply observing it. The tentacle itself and Experiment 27 were two completely separate things. Nobody was trying to...
Andrew 42:31
Which means that the orb is the catalyst in awakening whatever static substance was left over in the facility and letting it multiply into the thing that ended up killing Brevin.
Ned 42:43
Of the things that we know now. Yeah.
Brian 42:45
And the curiosity that still plays at hand is, to your knowledge, especially in the moment, there was no discernation as to why some of your guild mates became corrupted, and why some of you did not.
Landree 42:59
Is there value or someone who would know, like, speaking on these adaptations, et cetera? Like, what were, what kind of adaptations were you trying to develop or create? In this particular...
Ned 43:11
Carefully, what kind of adaptations or mutations were we not trying to create is a better question.
Landree 43:17
Is there an answer to that one as well?
Ned 43:20
Got a big book. It's a pretty small list.
Landree 43:22
Well, I mean, resistance to... really, resistance to disease, uh, evolution... I mean, uh, the ability to transfer from water to land, like, I mean, what kind of adaptations are you guys--
Eddie 43:36
Immortality.
Landree 43:36
Immortality.
Ned 43:37
'We believe in adaptation and mutation and change as a way to cause the next evolution of the world. Whether or not we are aiming for anything, a change will cause a catalyst, we aim to be the harbinger of the catalyst. See, I myself, yes, focus on this.' I put my hand on one of the metal walls and I leave it there and it turns very quickly into stone. 'Transmutation is my world.'
Sarah 44:02
So he just melted metal in front of me?
Ned 44:04
'Didn't melt, just changed.' It changes back pretty quickly.
Sarah 44:07
Still take a nice step away. Because I like my armor.
Landree 44:14
It just seems as though, if it affects certain people, and does it affect other people, there has to be a biological quality. I mean, Mr. Alfonso was tinkering with this, whatever, this orb for months, we've had it, we haven't been corrupted.
Andrew 44:30
So it seems like the next step would be to circle back with the Simic facility, see if the master biomancer and any of the medical staff have done anything on the deceased to kind of trace back what the initial infectant was, whether this stuff remains inert after the host is dead, and if that matches in any way, the sample that they had from the original excavation, because that confirms what we already suspect.
Landree 44:58
Yes.
Sarah 44:58
I'm going to assume that minotaurs are completely immune to this because I was not infected when there was blood all over me.
Ned 45:05
'Did the people you came across earlier have black tendrils?'
Sarah 45:09
No.
Eddie 45:09
No.
Ned 45:10
'I think it is safe to assume that they are not the same.'
Andrew 45:13
Yeah, two separate infections.
Brian 45:16
The feral creatures you found on the train, who were the remnants of Mr. Alfonso's security team--
Sarah 45:22
Right.
Brian 45:23
Did not have black tendrils.
Sarah 45:24
Okay.
Ned 45:25
But I do agree the zonot is the next step.
Brian 45:27
You take a brief trip back to the zonot to check in some of the autopsies that may be coming. Much of the information is the same. The only new piece of information that you have acquired that is quite curious is that the black veins of the corrupted have disappeared quite shortly after they have deceased.
Ned 45:45
Are we able to see any of the bodies?
Brian 45:47
Sure.
Ned 45:48
I would like to Detect Poison and Disease.
Brian 45:49
There is no poison or disease that you can detect.
Ned 45:53
Great.
Brian 45:53
Whatever was afflicting them seems to have left or dissipated after death.
Sarah 45:58
Do they, now that the tendrils have dissipated, did they look like the things that we encountered with Mr. Gato?
Brian 46:06
On the train? No, no, they have just reverted back to their original form.
Andrew 46:10
It's a good question though.
Sarah 46:12
I'm a smart cow.
Brian 46:12
So as of right now, what you know is there is some black vein corruption that is infecting people discriminately, and you did encounter some sort of transformation from a security team that left in pursuit of something but did not necessarily finish their jobs, we now know. And a large chunk of a train was suddenly transported over to another place.
Andrew 46:35
No one knows how.
Brian 46:36
And no one knows how.
Landree 46:37
But it also seems that this black substance, or whatever it is, needs a living host, potentially. If it's leaving--
Andrew 46:44
Yeah, it's not, it's not possessing dead bodies.
Landree 46:46
No.
Andrew 46:46
So the new hypothesis, if we're going to get scientific on this shit, is that the corruption has something to do with proximity to the substance.
Ned 46:58
But not entirely, because I was in a room full of people, only about 48% of whom changed.
Andrew 47:04
And again, it only affects hosts in a discriminate manner. It can only take on a certain volume or percentage, maybe?
Ned 47:11
Or there's a common factor between them.
Andrew 47:14
And it seems to have some relation to the orb. Whether or not the orb can create some kind of catalyst that induces infection remains unclear.
Ned 47:22
I also hate to say this as a scientist, but as of now the only hypothesis we can hold is that the black tendrils only affect the Simic hybrids.
Sarah 47:31
Is that--
Ned 47:31
I have not seen the bodies.
Eddie 47:33
'The first person I saw was not a Simic hybrid. He was infected. He was a human.'
Ned 47:40
'Well, that is relieving and terrifying.'
Brian 47:43
So as you guys step away from the zonot for the fourth time now, it is approaching dinnertime, possibly the moment to find yourself some grub. As you guys take a moment to mull over everything you've begun to piece together that whatever this orb is, it seems to be corrupting discriminately.
Andrew 48:02
'From the time it was unearthed at the excavation site, and after the Simic separated the substance from its inorganic component, they immediately pawn it off on one Alfonso the Third and then he in turn is immediately contacted by Master Researcher Malphus Reed. He does not sell the orb, which he claims to have been offered an exorbitant price for, but instead hires a security team and it is coincidentally immediately stolen. The thief absconds with the orb and goes to the Leg End in the 34th Precinct of the Boros Legion to contact the buyer, none other than one Malphus Reed. If he can't buy it, he'll steal it. Reed then is dismembered by a harlequin in the murder circus. The woman in his room, Elazia, reportedly a precognitive mage-- a cover that I can no longer trust-- the orb comes into our possession, is handed over to either the maze runnner Lavinia, or-- as seems more likely, at this point-- a Dimir operative that has assumed her identity. It is then planted on the comatose body of Elazia, who may or may not have been a precognitive mage. The orb is then smuggled back into a Simic medical facility where a pervasive corruption takes root within the staff.'
Landree 49:15
And Lavinia sent us back there. It seemed as if there was a purpose, that potentially the Dimir wanted this orb to be back in this Simic facility.
'Yes.'
Andrew 49:24
'Precisely.'
'So that they might decimate their numbers.'
Landree 49:27
Yes.
Ned 49:28
Thus far, the Dimir have been very quiet. They supposedly have not taken a side in the railway wars.
Andrew 49:34
'Or they're already operating under the guise of an unaffiliated railway.'
Ned 49:39
Has anyone asked if Mr. Alfonso has a guild affiliation?
Andrew 49:43
'We know that he does not.'
Landree 49:44
He says that he does not.
Andrew 49:46
'And he has not lying to us so far.'
Landree 49:47
That's true. That's true.
Ned 49:48
Have we asked him to his face? Or has people told us?
Sarah 49:52
He's told us.
Ned 49:53
He told us he's not part of a guild?
Sarah 49:55
Maybe?
Landree 49:56
No, Vizarra told us that he was not part of a guild.
Eddie 49:59
No, he did tell us that he was not part of a guild. And I believe he told us that while he was under my spell
Ned 50:05
I don't think he...
Eddie 50:06
My Zone of Truth.
Ned 50:07
Did...
Brian 50:08
Not while you were on the train.
Eddie 50:09
Not while we were on the train.
Brian 50:11
Not while you were on the train.
Eddie 50:12
Okay.
Brian 50:13
The only conversation you had on the train, was he told you the timeline of when it was stolen and agreed to pay you 250 zinos a week.
Sarah 50:21
Have we gotten that money?
Ned 50:22
It hasn't been a week.
Brian 50:23
It hasn't been a week.
Sarah 50:24
It's so long to wait.
Ned 50:25
It's been like half a day.
Brian 50:28
And you did not negotiate anything up front. It is supper time. Perhaps we have a conversation necessary with the man who will be serving you dinner.
Landree 50:35
Yes.
Brian 50:36
You guys return to the penthouse and, as you approach, the two twin elves down at the concierge greet you in tandem, 'Welcome back. Welcome back.' With a cheery smile that is equally pleasant and a little more creepy the second time that you see it. A sort of forced pleasantry. You head back up on the elevator and by the time you enter, there is a full spread waiting for you. Mr. Alfonso comes out of his private room with a bit of a cheery, 'Oh, hello, did we find the answers we were looking for?'
Ned 51:05
'More questions, it seems.'
Brian 51:06
'Oh, isn't that always the way of it, my boy?'
Ned 51:09
'Mr. Alfonso.'
Brian 51:10
'Yes.'
Ned 51:10
'Do you have anything to do with a fourth rail line?'
Brian 51:13
'Oh, the unaffiliated rail line. Yes, I bought my train from them.'
Ned 51:17
'And do you yourself hold any guild affiliation?'
Brian 51:21
'No, I do not.'
Eddie 51:22
Insight check.
Brian 51:23
Yes, please.
Eddie 51:24
Nevermind.
Ned 51:27
I am also a nevermind.
Brian 51:29
Nevermind.
Eddie 51:29
Zone of Truth! (elaborate casting noise)
Brian 51:32
Do it.
Eddie 51:33
I do it.
Brian 51:34
Oh, what, and he needs to roll... ? What, at least a 13?
Ned 51:37
13. Right?
Brian 51:38
Nope. Zone of Truth. He goes, 'Ah yes, the Zone of Truth again. Yes. I'm very sorry that you keep receiving answers that you're not intending to receive. But I'm not affiliated with any guild, otherwise, Azorius arrester, a great deal of my tri-- transactions then become quite illegal.'
Ned 51:56
'What do you know about the Dimir?'
Brian 51:58
'I did-- Oh. I will say this about the Dimir. Everything you learn about that atrocious guild is another thing you wish you didn't know about that atrocious guild. I can say this for certain. As far as the Dimir guild, I know more than most. I do know that they have their fronts and they keep their secrets. And they're quite good at keeping their secrets from folks like you and they may pose as messengers and probably assassinations, you have heard, it is always a great deal darker than that sort of thing: manipulations, political enterprises, anything you fear they might have the power to do, I would probably bet half of my train that they're able to do it. Is there a reason I need to be concerned about the Dimir?'
Ned 52:44
'Yes. Many, many reasons.'
Brian 52:47
'Has anybody told the lot of you on a regular occasion that you seem to bring an awful lot of bad news?'
Sarah 52:53
'Yes.'
Brian 52:53
'Oh, well, I've suddenly lost my appetite. What exactly great deal more trouble am I in now?'
Sarah 53:01
'A lot.'
Ned 53:02
'Do you know how to contact the Dimir?'
Brian 53:03
'Do I know how to contact the Dimir? I do not know how to contact the Dimir, which is why I am on this side of a jail cell.'
Eddie 53:12
'Are you involved in any illegal activities?'
Brian 53:15
'I am not involved in any illegal activities. All of my finances are reported.'
Andrew 53:22
'We should warn you that the artifact that you were previously in possession of was able to infect the former security member that stole it from you. When returned to the Simic facility, it seems that the orb was the catalyst for an infection outbreak that claimed a great many lives.'
Brian 53:41
'It never infected me.'
Andrew 53:43
'For which, I should think you were quite fortunate.'
Brian 53:46
'Oh.' And he kind of looks over the group of you, like, one of my security team went bonkers infection on me before. And now he's like, 'Um, well then. I thank you for your information. Please do help yourself to some food. I'm feeling a bit unsettled now. And I think I'm going to retire a bit early.' And he sort of makes to maybe lock himself inside his room.
Sarah 54:08
'Have a good evening!'
Brian 54:10
And he kind of steps inside his private room and you just hear kind of a click.
Sarah 54:17
Oh, man.
Ned 54:18
So group. Did we discern anything there that we didn't already know?
Eddie 54:21
No.
Ned 54:22
No.
Andrew 54:23
Well, we have an audience in the morning.
Eddie 54:25
I say we take a rest and go back.
Brian 54:28
Get our Zone of Truth re-slotted.
Eddie 54:32
Among other things.
Brian 54:33
Yeah. So you guys decided to retire for the night, confused, bewildered, and yet somehow more enlightened on whatever massive plot seems to be developing behind the curtain. As you drift off to sleep perhaps slightly later than intended, as the thoughts continue to burrow deep inside your brain, I would like anyone of desire to make a Perception check please. Andrew, would you do it with advantage?
Eddie 55:03
Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.
Andrew 55:05
23.
Landree 55:05
11.
Sarah 55:07
I got a 15.
Brian 55:08
Great.
Ned 55:08
I'm not helpful here. I got a 6.
Brian 55:10
Great.
Eddie 55:10
21.
Brian 55:11
Anyone who rolled above 20. You guys awake. Enough that you kind of look to each other and both realize that you're probably both awake for the exact same reason. Something don't feel right.
Eddie 55:29
'Everyone get up right now!'
Andrew 55:32
Lorzatch moves outside the room.
Brian 55:34
Okay, as you move outside the room, Lorzatch, you are the first person to notice that the door to Rufir's room is open and there is a very faint blue light.
Ned 55:46
Maybe should have posted guards. Let's do this. Bad at the job.
Brian 55:51
What would you like to do?
Andrew 55:52
Lorzatch is going to...
Brian 55:54
Make a sneak check?
Andrew 55:55
Yes.
Brian 55:59
That is an amazing sneak check. As you creep quietly towards his room, you can see this pale blue light emanating from out the door. Inside, however, you find Mr. Alfonso asleep quietly on his back. Floating above Mr. Alfonso, however, you find a very tall, gangly, pale blue humanoid creature enshrouded in a long black cloak like smoke. He has this pale blue skin and a long black-nailed claw is outstretched over the top of Mr. Alfonso's face and he is sucking some sort of blue light, absorbing it from Mr. Alfonso's mind into his hand. And even though, with such an amazing Stealth roll, you know you can't be seen, you see the creature give just a slight crick of its neck towards your direction.

Brian 0:19
Last time, on Encounter Party! A bio-contamination threw Zonot 4 into lockdown, isolating our players from the outside world. While trying to find the source, our players made a horrifying discovery. The missing orb had returned, embedded in a laboratory monster. Try as they might, our players could not defeat the beast and met with an impossible choice: save the life of Brevin, or recover the orb. With one fighter dead and the other unconscious, the three remaining heroes are trapped underwater at the bottom of Zonot 4. Will they make it out alive? Find out this week on Encounter Party!
So last week, we met with tragedy as we lost Brevin the fighter who was played by Ned Donovan. As for the rest of you, the bottom of Zonot 4 might as well be a tomb. All of the lights are out and only a few remaining systems even have power. You do have air to breathe, but the only sound you can hear in the dark is the trickling of water you can begin to hear seeping through the walls. Remember that Vizarra mentioned no one had reported from below so you are very much alone. And, don't forget, zonots are basically underwater skyscrapers. So you have a great deal of distance to crawl out of and you have an unconscious minotaur to haul with you. What would you like to do?
Eddie 1:55
I use Cure Wounds on her.
Brian 1:57
Okay.
Landree 1:59
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Brian 2:01
Have you guys rolled max hit points on the last three rolls?
Sarah 2:05
Yes.
Brian 2:06
Oh, well.
Eddie 2:06
That is 11 points.
Brian 2:07
Holy cow.
Sarah 2:08
Thank you.
Brian 2:08
Great.
Eddie 2:10
'Wake up!' (slapping noise)
Sarah 2:14
Motherfucker.
Brian 2:15
Welcome, welcome back. You... at this point, she doesn't know. You look around and you see, not much because you're still in the dark.
Sarah 2:26
Right.
Brian 2:27
And you can quickly count 'one, two, three, four,' which is the exact amount of fingers you have on a minotaur hand.
Sarah 2:33
'One, two, three...' Sound off?
Landree 2:35
'Oh, Brevin is dead.'
Sarah 2:38
'What.'
Landree 2:39
'Yes, he died.'
Sarah 2:41
'How?'
Landree 2:42
'Well, we had to flood the bottom two levels and he was still down there. He was unconscious. So he's dead now.'
Eddie 2:49
'He saved all of our lives.'
Sarah 2:51
'You left him to die?'
Eddie 2:54
'It was the only option.'
Sarah 2:56
'Bull shit, it was the only option, you do not leave another soldier behind.'
Eddie 3:02
'You were too busy being passed out on the floor to understand what was going on. But it was the only option. He saved all of our lives. He knew what he was doing.'
Sarah 3:12
'That-- no, that is unacceptable.'
Andrew 3:15
'To retrieve him would have meant passing back through its warpath, endangering our lives and yours and potentially sacrificing us all to retrieve one dying man.'
Ned 3:28
'You don't leave a comrade behind.'
Andrew 3:31
'You're welcome. By the way.'
Ned 3:32
'I shouldn't have to thank you for something that is understood.'
Landree 3:38
'I'd like to point out that also because you were passed out, you also left Brevin behind. So sometimes we need to turn this a little inward.'
Sarah 3:48
'Don't you need to go blow yourself up somewhere?'
Landree 3:50
'Not yet.'
Brian 3:51
Can I get a Perception check from everybody?
Andrew 3:54
10.
Brian 3:55
Yes.
Sarah 3:56
I rolled a 5.
Brian 3:57
Great. That new die ain't working out quite so much. So you are up the last flight of stairs that you've seen. The bottom has stabled-- Yes, please.
Andrew 4:08
We went up.
Brian 4:09
You went up. Yes, you have that... Lorzatch, immediately after you kind of went up and activated the purging mechanism that dropped the last two floors down into the well, that is all part of the protocol and sealed off. So you guys are safe, but you are still in like ankle deep water, there is a bit of an unsettling amount of water around. Power seems to be down for the most part. But it does not mean that the area is intraversible, non-traversible? One of the two, either or. But the rest of the area that you're in looks very similar to the floor that you were below. Small chambers, you are in dim light because they're still on some of these tanks with some of this strange glowing fluid, fish and other weird bio-organisms just sort of tolling around, either experiments, or purposeful, you know, workings of the zonot itself. At the moment, you are stable, but you can see the more manual escape options as far as what could be the long trek back up to the surface.
Eddie 5:17
'I believe we need to try and get back up to the surface to tell everyone what has happened down here.'
Andrew 5:23
'If we can access one of the pneumatic tubes that brought us down here to begin with, we might be able to return in one piece.'
Sarah 5:30
There's no way we can retrieve Brevin's body?
Andrew 5:33
'Would you like to go for a swim?'
Brian 5:35
You can, you can actually see out of, there's a couple of portholes, and also the staircase that's like right next to you.
Sarah 5:44
Yeah.
Brian 5:44
There is like a, like a film over it. And you can see down that whole area that you were battling in is just gone.
Sarah 5:53
Okay.
Brian 5:53
It had been like purged off of the zonot, not just like flushed out. But like, the whole part of that structure was cut away from the wall and is now way down into the depths.
Sarah 6:03
Okay.
Brian 6:04
So that's what you see. The, the actual, retrieving him is not an option. Retrieving anything is not an option. You are right now as far down as you can be without drowning.
Sarah 6:13
All right, we go up then, somehow.
Brian 6:16
So you begin the long trek upward, mostly by feel as it is still very dark. You will encounter many wrong turns and most of the doors have to be opened manually by brute force and all of this through ankle-deep water. And it's slow going, but--
Eddie 6:33
I cast Light on my shield so we can see.
Brian 6:35
Great, so you have even better light.
Landree 6:36
And Frank, my dancing lights.
Brian 6:38
Frank returns. So it's this winding, twisting, Giger-esque pathway as there are seemingly no straight lines in this facility and you start to become disoriented and lose track of time. Unless, does anybody have any Ranger abilities to determine, you know, like direction, time of day? No? Okay. So you start to lose track of time as each floor is like its own mini-dungeon as you guys have to hunt in the dark for the stairwell that will lead up to the next floor. And eventually, after about 15 floors, you come upon this very large door that looks like it leads into some sort of very large chamber. But there is no power to the door and it will take some sort of physical effort to open manually.
Andrew 7:21
Lorzatch will look for another console.
Brian 7:24
Give me Investigation.
Eddie 7:25
While he does that, let's try and open this door together.
Brian 7:29
You do, great, I'm gonna hold that for a second. I'm just gonna tell him what he sees. And then we'll let you guys go.
Andrew 7:33
17.
Brian 7:34
You do find another console. But unlike the other one that you see, this one seems to be-- you are elvish. So you can you can see that the message on this particular console suggests that there is a lockdown on this particular area. But it is not accessible from this console, whatever access to these and controls to this particular room is prioritized by whatever is inside of that room. So you're getting the sense that that room is designed to be able to lock itself down from the inside. So this is some sort of smaller quarantine section, you guys would like to try and force open the door?
Sarah 8:13
Yes.
Brian 8:14
So designate somebody to make a Strength check with advantage.
Sarah 8:17
With advantage, you said? That is a 23.
Brian 8:21
Great. So the two of you kind of put your effort into it and you find a way to dig your minotaur hands deep into whatever goo makes up these doors in this place. And you pull and you tear. And there's a great deal of force but not in a physical resistance as in like a vacuum resistance. And it doesn't take very much effort for you to kind of just shove this door open before a massive torrent of water just pours out of this place. I need everybody to make a Strength saving throw, please.
Landree 8:58
Does me being aquatic help, help me at all in this respect?
Brian 9:02
Not from being bludgeoned by a wave of water.
Landree 9:04
Yeah you right, you right.
Andrew 9:05
17.
Brian 9:06
Great.
Eddie 9:06
6.
Landree 9:07
An unnatural 1.
Brian 9:09
12. Great. Eddie and Landree. So Zenia and Lennox, you will both take 6 points of bludgeoning damage and get knocked on your butts. The rest of you seem to be okay at the moment either because you're just right in front or you might be slightly far enough down that you don't get flushed. But there's an insane amount of water that pours out of this room. And if the floor you were on weren't as wide enough, and you hadn't kind of opened the doors that you did on your way up to let this water sort of passed down through the stairwells, you might have inadvertently just flooded yourselves and died by drowning. It's like that much water. As you get a chance to kind of step in the natural light that you guys have made with your shield and with Frank expose an absolute horror scene. There are Simic dead everywhere, some drowned, some dead by combat. And way on the far end of this massive, what looks like an operating room, you can hear the faint calling of three figures on the far wall who are still alive. You see two people who look like sentries and then one Simic member who seems to be some sort of medical professional. Ned Donovan, welcome back, would you please describe the character that they are meeting.
Sarah 9:09
12.
Ned 10:33
Across the room, you see a six-foot-tall Vedalken hybrid. The hybrid has, rather than the normal blue skin, a translucent blue hue that you can almost see through but not quite. He looks at you, one arm outstretched, and a green sort of glow moving around his hand pointed straight in your direction. He stands tall and direct and immediately says, 'Identify yourself or die.'
Brian 11:01
The two merfolk sentries that seem to be with him kind of look up to him at his attitude and now realize we might have to round two with some more fighting and they kind of slowly peel themselves up off the floor, shoulder their spears and look like they're--
Eddie 11:17
'Vizarra, your biomancer, sent us down here to help.'
Andrew 11:21
'We put down the krasis on the levels below.'
Ned 11:24
'Fikarra Ordruun, First Class, Boros Legion, 34th District.'
Landree 11:29
'I'm Zenia.'
Ned 11:30
'And what is a group of ragtag fighters doing at the bottom of my zonot without a single Simic guide?'
Andrew 11:38
'Because they were all murdered by the krasis that you created.'
Ned 11:43
'I will be very careful with you.'
Andrew 11:44
'Please do.'
Ned 11:45
'If you look around, every single one of these bodies is one of my people that I have spent years with, and most of them were killed by me. So I want you to be very careful when I ask you this question: are any of you corrupted?'
Sarah 12:02
'Not to my knowledge.'
Andrew 12:03
'Describe this corruption.'
Brian 12:06
What you see before you very distinctly between some of these bodies, is that a portion, say about 40% of the Simic Combine members that are littering the room, are infected or covered in those black veins that sort of pustule out from some of the people that we've seen before. It's the same black veins that sort of crawled up into that krasis as it began evolving into a more sort of black amorphous creature. It's also the same black veins, Lennox, that you would have saw from that vagabond way back at the Leg End.
Andrew 12:42
And that are etched into the orb that Lorzatch has.
Brian 12:46
No the orb is, is and always has been, just a perfect pristine metal sphere.
Andrew 12:53
Got it.
Brian 12:54
No blemishes, it doesn't even tarnish, doesn't even leave any oil on it. It is just perfect. Also, Lorzatch, would you please give me a Medicine check?
Andrew 13:03
Yes. 17.
Brian 13:06
Great. So you can also identify that several of these people are dead from drowning. A quick look at the three survivors. One very distinct aspect of them is two of them are merfolk and-- are they showing? Your, your Simic medical officer, who seems to be very aggressive to you right now, has gills. So several of these people died simply by drowning. A great portion of them have died from martial wounds, there was some sort of battle that happened in here. And the way that the bodies lie, it's very clear that there was a fight between the corrupted, as he describes them, and the non-corrupted. You also find buried beneath some of the pile of corpses is the now very distinctly dead body of Elazia.
Andrew 13:50
And does Elazia's body bear any of the same marks as the other corrupted?
Brian 13:55
It does not.
Landree 13:56
I'd like to go over to Elazia's body and search it again.
Brian 14:01
Sure.
Landree 14:04
Cool. Only a 5.
Brian 14:06
There's just a lot of, it's kind of waterlogged. What you do see is that whatever sort of, like, whatever she had kind of been wrapped in for care for part of the trip that it kind of kept her in stasis, that is no longer on her. You can find it, it was clearly cut deliberately, probably by the medical staff. But as far as anything else there's really just sort of the chaos of, it would be hard to even determine what was on her person and not part of somebody else's person.
Ned 14:32
'Are the bodies contagious at this point?'
'I have absolutely no idea.'
I start moving the...
Brian 14:40
Somebody can perform a Medicine check to answer that question. Either--
Ned 14:44
I can do it.
Brian 14:44
Yep. Either you or Lorzatch.
Andrew 14:46
Lorzatch will assist.
Brian 14:47
Yeah, so roll with advantage.
Ned 14:50
Advantage was useful. It's a 23.
Brian 14:52
There has been a lot of contact. I mean, it was a full out brawl. But as far as you can tell, Simic stranger, there has been no cross contamination, that getting into a fistfight with somebody who was corrupted has not transferred the infection or whatever it is, is not transferred from person to person. By your account of what happened before the brawl, several people turned and it was not really a very discernible understanding of who did and who did not and why they did and why they did not.
Ned 15:26
I put my hand down. 'I have no option right now but to trust you. But one wrong move and my sentries will kill you without any remorse or second guessing.'
Andrew 15:36
'How can we return to the surface?'
Ned 15:38
'Power is out. And until we can restore the power we have to go by foot, level by level, floor by floor.'
I'd like to just be moving the bodies and kind of separating, like, basically lining them up in a mildly respectful manner and just separating them.
Brian 15:53
Yeah, please take a point of Inspiration.
Sarah 15:55
Oh, thank you.
Andrew 15:56
'This woman, Elazia. Were you here examining her?'
Ned 15:59
'Yes.'
Andrew 15:59
'What happened?'
Ned 16:02
'Someone arrived here needing medical attention. They were sent down to the bottom of the zonot where we could be protected against problems, as it appears you found out. Early on, there was a warning. I was called in because something about the woman you see here was imbued with a magic energy that no one had seen before or understood.'
Sarah 16:23
'But the Simic know about that stuff.'
Ned 16:26
'No. We know about many things. But I was, I don't get called in for routine medicine moments. I came down. What we discovered, well, an alarm was hit. Very quickly, a bio-contaminant went off. Soon after, many of my colleagues here on the floor began to turn, change, adjust, adapt, and immediately attack.'
Andrew 16:51
'Was she the originator?'
Ned 16:52
'Unclear. It did not come from her. Whether or not she was the catalyst is something I am very, very curious about. As we fought, one of our doctors, Lorin, she hit the lockdown button, knowing that this could not get out of these floors. At that point, everything shut down, communications cut off, doorways were sealed. As we battled, we began to lose badly. And I made the only choice I knew how to do. I hit the floor purge, I let in the water, drowning everyone who was corrupted, along with the rest of my team.'
Andrew 17:26
'It was at this point that we were sent down to take care of the krasis on the lowest levels.'
Ned 17:32
'And what did you find?'
Andrew 17:33
'An adaptive krasis that was able to regenerate upon death, increasing its lethality with each new incarnation. Embedded inside of its flesh was one very, very unique artifact, a perfectly round sphere, the nature of which we do not yet understand.'
Ned 17:53
'Do you have the sphere in your possession?'
Andrew 17:55
'I have it in mine.'
Ned 17:56
'Is it safe?'
'Okay, we need to get to the surface immediately.'
Andrew 17:58
'No.'
'Agreed.'
Ned 18:03
'By the way, my name is Parax.'
Brian 18:04
So with Parax in lead, you guys again, claw your way up to the top, over and over flight. As you go through dark, wet, disturbingly quiet sections of this underground facility. The two sentries that were with Parax are in a lot worse condition than they bluffed during the encounter. And they need your help carrying them, shoulder to shoulder, on the way back up to the surface. I need everyone to give me a Survival check, please.
Andrew 18:39
16.
Ned 18:40
19.
Landree 18:41
Unnatural 20.
Sarah 18:42
15.
Eddie 18:43
19.
Ned 18:44
It's good to have your rolls, Sarah.
Brian 18:45
Surprisingly, even in the wake of everything that's happened, you find the energy to avoid levels of exhaustion. Perhaps it's the light at the end of the tunnel. Perhaps the higher you climb, the closer you are to getting out of this hell. As you continue to climb, you begin to see more Simic guild members on the upper floors. Many admin people are racing about trying to regain any sense of order among the disarray. You climb and climb and eventually you can feel the sunlight peeking through the windows, signaling that you've reached the floors that sit above the waterfall. When you eventually reach the lobby you find a collection of high-level guild members gathered around a makeshift command center hastily assembled in the middle of the lobby. There are papers, pieces of kelp and all manner of equipment strewn about the floor connected to aqua-power generators. Everyone is shouting at each other with that strange Simic manner where they are forceful but polite at the same time, all without really showing any emotion at all. Standing at the center of the group, taller than any other, is Master Biomancer Vizarra. She spots you from across the lobby. And once she recognizes you, Parax, she hustles over to you.
Ned 19:55
I immediately take a hand and I put it on Zenia's head. And I say, 'Vizarra, can you confirm their story? Or do we need to take them down?'
Brian 20:03
'Is this all that's left?'
Ned 20:05
'What do you mean?'
Brian 20:06
'Are there any others with you?'
Ned 20:08
'No.'
Brian 20:08
'You are the first and the only to make it up. Come with me please.' And she very politely, much more so than anyone else you've discussed in this entire adventure, begs you to join her in that antechamber that she talked to you before. As soon as you guys make it in, you finally get a chance to decompress just for a moment and rest, the two sentries who were with you are taken away for medical care. And in that moment of privacy, Vizarra herself finally let's go for a moment, her pristine merfolk frills wilt, her body crumples over, and the weight of what's going on for just the moment gets to her. And she just looks up at you, Parax and is like, 'What happened?'
Ned 20:57
'We contained the problem. We lost many people.'
Brian 21:01
'I saw the reports that the bottom floor had been purged. Is this true?'
Ned 21:06
'You can talk to these people about that.'
Brian 21:10
'Who authorized the purge of the bottom well?'
Sarah 21:12
'We did.'
Andrew 21:13
'I was the one that activated the purge.'
Brian 21:16
'Did something get out?'
Andrew 21:17
'Well, it died. Of that much we can be certain.'
Eddie 21:20
'Well, we hope so. It was a very powerful beast. We purged it into the abyss.'
Brian 21:28
'Let's see, the bottom floor would be Experiment 57. That is not a violent creation. What has happened?'
Eddie 21:36
'It was violent when we arrived.'
Andrew 21:38
'Are you aware that there was an artifact embedded inside of its flesh?'
Brian 21:41
She kind of looks at you strangely, too tired to be confused, but she has no idea what you're talking about.
'Yes, I see.' And she straightens up and recollects herself sort of resuming the, the power of her office, remembering that she is a master biomancer and she, she takes the authority back and says, 'Now, tell me what happened. What of the patient? What of that Dimir spy they brought to my laboratory?'
Ned 21:49
'Be careful.'
'Gone. We took care of everyone except the three that came out with these people.'
Brian 22:19
'Dead or gone?'
Ned 22:22
'Both.'
Brian 22:22
'And what of the krasis?'
Andrew 22:24
'Jettisoned from the bottom levels.'
Brian 22:26
'I need a full account of what happened. Was anyone alive? What of the caretakers? The scientists?'
Sarah 22:32
'There were no caretakers on the second level, at the very bottom level-- levels.
Andrew 22:32
'No.'
'There were no personnel of any kind to be seen, merely the adaptive krasis.'
Brian 22:37
'And you've killed it.'
Andrew 22:42
'We purged the bottom levels. If its final form could survive the crushing depths of the abyss...'
Brian 22:48
'It evolved?'
Andrew 22:49
'Many times and seemed capable of evolving further.'
Brian 22:53
'How? Describe it please, this is important.'
Andrew 22:57
'It started as an amphibious creature, one blazing yellow eye...'
Landree 23:03
'Four legs.'
Andrew 23:04
'And an outer epidermis seemingly capable of bending light to its will and thus appearing invisible to the mortal eye.'
Brian 23:12
'That was our intended development, but all of our evolutions are manually instigated. Our experiments are not allowed to spontaneously mutate. It's a safety precaution to keep us in control.'
Andrew 23:25
'The following form was a hybrid shape composed of parts equally arthropodal and, I suppose, shark and--'
Brian 23:33
She seems to just be like 'okay, yeah, this is all normal.'
Andrew 23:36
'And from this--'
Brian 23:38
I guess shark-crabs. Normal.
Andrew 23:40
'It rapidly decomposed into a protoplasmic black slime that then adhered into what I can only describe as a colossal salamander.'
Brian 23:52
'Tendrils?'
Andrew 23:53
'Many.'
Brian 23:54
She gets incredibly frightened and looks to you, Parax.
Ned 23:59
'Fifty percent. Fifty percent of our team.'
Brian 24:02
'Oh no.'
Andrew 24:03
'Are they related?'
Ned 24:04
'Those black tendrils...'
Brian 24:06
'I'm afraid they are.'
Ned 24:07
'Yes.'
Brian 24:08
'You've purged it but you did not kill it. And now it has descended deep into the water.' And she suddenly becomes very afraid and her eyes shoot open wide. 'You have to get to the pump station. You have to shut down the water! Parax, it's going to be in the water!' And she commands you all to fly as fast as you can to the pump station. Now, Zenia, you would know that the pump station is run by the Izzet, so you need to drop everything that you're doing and rush to the pump station ASAP to convince the Izzet to shut down the water. Parax, you see Vizarra pull a small toad from her hip and she whispers a couple of things to it before handing it to you. And she says, 'You must hurry. Take this in case there's a problem but I beg of you please go now.'
Sarah 24:56
'Yes, ma'am.'
AD BREAK
Brian 25:36
You guys are off, racing your way. Yes.
Landree 25:39
Zenia just charges and expects everyone else to...
Brian 25:42
Great. It is a hustle. Can I please get another Survival check from you guys as you storm through the streets of the compound.
Natural 20 looks pretty awesome to me, that rainbow-colored died looks awesome.
Andrew 25:56
10.
Sarah 25:57
14.
Eddie 25:57
11.
Brian 25:58
An 11.
Ned 25:59
17.
Brian 25:59
And a 17. Just barely for some of you, the imperative-ness of the situation is just... you've got to go, the adrenaline is pumping, the urgency of what possibly could happen, the severity of this seems way outside your realm of reasoning but enough to know that shit is going to happen if you do not rush. You make your way--yes.
Sarah 26:19
To help with the pace, I'll drum.
Brian 26:21
Great. Great. Great. I love it. I would say that if anybody had failed their Survival check at that point that we could make that go keep tempo. In fact, I will allow your party to have advantage on their first skill check when they get to the... collectively, whoever decides to roll it, you may have advantage to your first skill check when you reach the pump station. It's a bit of a slog. It's like a good 20-minute dead run hustle to try and get there. If you guys look at the map that you can see, the noise is louder and louder and louder as you reach a water pump station. It's a weird building that is full of everything you would expect from the Izzet: tubes and cylinders that come from who knows where and lead to who knows what, the sound is unbearable. The conditions alone make you wonder why anyone other than a Rakdos cultist would even want to hang out in this place. But for you, Zenia, it finally feels like home. You guys barge your way through. Can I have somebody give some sort of Intimidation or Persuasion check to make your way into an authority where you can find whoever's in charge of the pump station.
Eddie 27:34
We can both do it.
Sarah 27:35
Okay.
Eddie 27:36
We can, I can, who has the higher one? We can, we can...
Sarah 27:39
I've got a plus--
Brian 27:40
You can assist and save your advantage.
Eddie 27:43
You should assist me.
Sarah 27:44
Oh, actually, plus... plus five.
Eddie 27:46
Then I should assist you.
Brian 27:47
And then save your, save your drum Inspiration for a different roll.
Sarah 27:53
And that's 24.
Brian 27:54
Great. You guys come in like a fury. You have no idea what's going on, but these are Izzet workers, they're busy pulling levers and looking over their glasses to make notes on a clipboard and you guys are just-- here comes a minotaur busting through like 'don't have time--'
Sarah 28:11
'Make a hole!'
Brian 28:12
'Make a hole, people!' (drumming noise) 'I don't have time for this.' Zenia, with a little bit of help from you, you guys managed to, like, I'm pretty sure I know who would be in charge and where to find them. And you guys burst your way into the command center of who is a very startled female Vedalken, whose day has just been completely uppended by, 'What? Who are you? What are you doing here?'
Landree 28:12
'You need to shut down the pump, the water pump.'
Brian 28:39
'I'm sorry, can we begin from the beginning where I should care about whatever this is?'
Sarah 28:43
'Now!'
Ned 28:44
I just hold up the toad.
Brian 28:45
Oh, great. You hold out the toad and the toad opens its mouth. And from the mouth of the toad comes the recorded message of the master biomancer. And she just says, 'This is Master Biomancer Vizarra of Zonot #4, there is a contaminant in the water system. You are hereby ordered based on our lease agreement to shut down the water pumps now.' And with that message, the frog just kind of turns into goo.
Ned 29:12
The goo is absorbed by my hand.
Brian 29:14
Great.
Sarah 29:15
Ugh.
Brian 29:15
Awesome. It's just a one time recorded message.
You knew that if this was to ever go wrong in the other way, a little fun note, that frog has also one charge of a plaxcaster in it. Which means that if somebody was really just like, 'I don't want to listen to this message,' it just goes 'firing my laser' (laser noise).
Sarah 29:20
Right.
Brian 29:40
If you hadn't rolled your Intimidation check correctly that's what would have happened, is this frog would have just cleared a hole for you. So this Vedalken is kind of looking at you and, and she's kind of looking at you and she's like, 'Is this real?'
Ned 29:51
'Yes.'
Brian 29:52
'I cannot shut this down.'
Andrew 29:53
'What do you mean you cannot shut it down?'
Sarah 29:54
'We're not asking.'
Brian 29:56
'I have direct orders from Master Researcher Malphus Reed that under no circumstances am I to shut this pump station down.'
Ned 30:05
'Please remind me, where is this pump station located?'
Andrew 30:07
Don't we know Malphus Reed?
Ned 30:09
Yeah.
Brian 30:09
Yes, Malphus Reed is the name of--
Sarah 30:11
'Wait. What? Malphus Reed?'
Brian 30:14
'Yes.'
Sarah 30:15
'Malphus Reed is dead.'
Brian 30:17
Malphus Reed is the dismembered man who was murdered in the Leg End tavern for those of you at home following along.
Andrew 30:24
Thank you.
Brian 30:24
She goes, 'What?'
Sarah 30:26
'I saw his limbs. Turn off the pump now.'
Brian 30:29
So--
Ned 30:30
'You don't have a choice here. To be clear.'
Brian 30:32
That is evident. She, she protests a great deal as she's going over. She says, 'Yes, Vizarra has control and ultimate authority. But I am in a great deal of trouble here. Master Researcher Malphus Reed came to me personally and gave me direct instructions that under no circumstances-- he said that this pump station was vital for the research that he is doing and there is going to be a major shit storm between the biomancers and the Izzet compound.'
Andrew 30:58
'I'm sorry, is an adaptive krasis in your water supply turning your people into slavering mutants also beneficial for Izzet research?'
Eddie 31:06
I use Channel Divinity and I order her to turn it off.
Brian 31:06
'I do not know! This is why you Simic are always digging into the wrong things, playing with life, playing with creatures instead of studying science in its natural form!'
Oh, what is the DC on that?
Eddie 31:21
13.
Brian 31:23
Oh, yeah, she's like, okay, she's like, fine, she goes 'fine.' So she, she calls down to a bunch of people. There's some goblins working there. She said, 'Turn it off! Turn off the pumps!' And they're like, 'Are you serious?' 'I am not fucking around, turn off the pumps now! There is a contamination!' And they're like, 'Oh, shit.' And then the goblins all kind of scurry. And you hear a great deal of loud machinery as the entire pump station comes to a screeching, grinding halt. And suddenly, the whole compound is just sort of filled with this echo of metallic pain that takes just a time to just sort of dissipate. And she turns to the rest of them. She says, 'I hope you are happy. Now the entire compound is under lockdown. We are stuck here until this message is fixed.' She kind of is, like, done with you.
Ned 32:14
'Do not worry, Izzet, we will get it back on in short order.'
Brian 32:16
Now what you would know, Parax, is that by shutting down a major utility like this is, it's grounds for the entire compound to be locked down. So that entire area on the map that is surrounded by the wall is now completely quarantined.
Sarah 32:33
Guess we're Simic now.
Andrew 32:35
So is there any part--
Brian 32:37
Get out the green and blue, ladies and gentlemen, because we're fish people from here on out.
Sarah 32:41
Look at me, I can swim!
Andrew 32:45
Is there any part of this facility that would be open to the water supply? Is there a place for this krasis to emerge?
Brian 32:53
Yeah, that massive water well that is in the middle of the map, where it is currently, but it's way down. So all of the Simic facilities, especially the zonots, connect to the underground oceans. So the very, very underneath of Ravnica is actually a massive waterway ocean. We're talking below the undercity where the Golgari are. And that's why, that's where the merfolk had been for millennia. And they only appeared after the catastrophe that was the breaking of the Guildpact about 75 years ago. So wherever that is, it's down and it's deep, and it's under the undercity. So wherever it goes, it may not end up anywhere, but it's way, way, way way down. Perhaps forever.
Ned 33:35
Now does the quarantine block off being able to potentially send a runner back to Vizarra?
Brian 33:40
Oh, no, you guys can still, as you can see in the map, everything in that area is still open.
Ned 33:46
Got it.
Brian 33:46
You just cannot leave the compound. So that massive walled-in area. So you can still, the Izzet research center, the pump station, the civilian area, the zonot: those are all still in the area, but you are restricted to the overall Simic controlled area. You are in Simic turf for the moment, permanently.
Andrew 34:04
And we are not likely to get this quarantine lifted until we can be sure that it won't seep into the water supply and endanger the entire city.
Brian 34:13
As of right now, the ultimate authority within this area is Vizarra. So the only person who can lift this quarantine at the moment would be her or whoever replaces her in authority. The Izzet, you guys have not actually kind of learned what they're doing here. Or why they're technically set up shop on Simic property. Yes. So as you, as you kind of leave the pump station and take a second to consider what you're going to do, maybe head back and, back to the zonot and have a conversation with some of the Simic...
Ned 34:49
That's what I want to do...
Brian 34:50
You get a chance to kind of look up at the sky and get your bearings for the first time and realize that it is morning, which means that you have been down under the water for the entirety of yesterday all through the night battling that monstrosity, saving the few Simic that you managed to find and climbing your way all the way back up to the surface. What would you like to do?
Andrew 35:13
For the first time in 16 hours? There isn't an immediate crisis requiring our attention.
Eddie 35:19
I think we should get some rest.
Landree 35:21
I agree.
Ned 35:21
I'd like to do that but return to the zonot.
Andrew 35:23
That makes sense.
Ned 35:24
I do not want to be anywhere near this Izzet establishment.
Eddie 35:27
Let's return.
Brian 35:28
Okay. So you head back to Zonot 4. I don't think anybody's going to impede your entrance at this point, I think partly because you have Parax with you. And also because your presence isn't quite so strange anymore. But inside the lobby is still an absolute madhouse. Everybody's running around. They're trying to get a hold of the situation. So it's difficult to find any place to sort of sit and rest without being in somebody's way. But I will say that the young Xavi I think approaches you as she sees you coming in the front door and says, 'Hi, would you like a place to sit down?' And leads you back into that antechamber which has kind of become your, like, remote personal space inside the zonot. You guys can take a short rest while you're in there.
Sarah 36:12
Okay.
Landree 36:12
Yes please. Thank you.
Eddie 36:13
How about a long rest?
Brian 36:14
A long rest requires like six to eight hours and you're not going to get that much time because Vizarra would like to speak to you again.
Eddie 36:21
Damn Vizarra. Come on. I'm sleepy.
Brian 36:25
She liked to, she'd like to check in on you at least.
Eddie 36:29
Damn girl.
Landree 36:30
Did we ever get the Vedalken female's name who was running the pump station?
Brian 36:34
No.
Landree 36:35
Okay, okay.
Andrew 36:36
We can head back later.
Sarah 36:37
I would like to ask Ned's character, Ned's character--
Brian 36:40
Yeah.
Sarah 36:40
What his name is.
Ned 36:41
'I am Parax.'
Sarah 36:42
'Fikarra. Good to meet you.'
Andrew 36:43
'Sorry, ""parrots?""'
Ned 36:45
'Parax. With an X.'
Brian 36:47
Xavi does come back and bring you guys some food, something to drink. She makes a joke: 'Don't worry, it's not corrupted.' And then immediately realized that that's in horrible taste and very embarrassingly retreats back out to go help whoever she has to help.
Landree 37:02
'I'd actually like to know for certain where this actually came from. How do you know it's not contaminated?'
Brian 37:07
'Because it came from the cafeteria.'
Sarah 37:09
'Thank you, Xavi.'
Brian 37:10
You guys get a bit of time to converse with yourself before Vizarra will pay you a third visit.
Sarah 37:16
I assume we have, like, drinks, or whatever. Can we--
Brian 37:19
Nothing alcoholic, just nourishment.
Sarah 37:21
Right, like water. Whatever.
Brian 37:23
The Simic are probably not imbibing as you, if you remember from that one woman in the Leg End who was feeding her alcohol to her toad, and not to herself.
Sarah 37:33
Probably at a moment when everybody's kind of a little quiet, Fikarra's just going to be like, 'Can we take a moment and toast to Brevin for all that he gave us and all that he helped us with?'
Ned 37:43
'Who?'
Sarah 37:44
'He was our man that we lost. And to all of the Simic who gave their lives.'
Landree 37:48
'And to Elazia.'
Ned 37:49
'Who's Elazia?'
Sarah 37:51
'Elazia was--'
Andrew 37:52
'The woman in your clinic.'
Sarah 37:54
Gulp.
Ned 37:55
'I will not drink to her.'
Andrew 37:57
'And the dead don't care either way.'
Landree 38:00
'And cheers to that.'
Brian 38:01
So after a brief moment, you guys get a chance to eat, get a little short rest in, decompress, and perhaps let the weight of the situation fall off your shoulders for a time. Vizarra manages to bring herself back into your presence. She has regained her poise, she has resumed her station. Right now, what the situation needs is her leadership and her intelligence. And she's still kind of curious about what happened. But she seems to be more curious about what seems to have been the trigger for the lockdown, which was whoever was in that Medical Center in the middle of the zonot, since they were the ones who activated it. And that activation you very quickly has to come from somebody high up and she starts discussing with Parax about the operation, you learn that there was a very high-level doctor, probably second or third in command at the zonot, who is in command of the operation, you learn that the setup was that Elazia was brought in and she was sent down with this medical team, and that, from your understanding, it was treated seriously that they had every intent to preserve this woman. And they understood the seriousness of the idea of precognition, and they were trying to do their best to bring her back so that information could be utilized. And you very quickly, you very quickly get a sense that their intention of doing so was maybe not as kind as they thought. But they thought that they could use this information to parlay assistance from the Azorius to deal with these three other guilds that are trying to vie for permission to build their, their rail lines through their system. So that you understand was the initial setup, but where everything went wrong, she kind of talks to Parax and says, 'Now, were you there at the moment of intubation?'
Ned 39:50
'I was.'
Brian 39:51
'And what happened? Was she the cause of the outbreak?'
Ned 39:54
'Unclear. It did not appear to emanate from her or the object.'
Brian 39:59
'What object?'
Ned 40:01
'Your sphere is back.'
Brian 40:03
'You must be joking.'
Ned 40:04
'Golgari, please produce the sphere.'
Andrew 40:07
And he pulls out what used to be a simple mess kit. And inside that container is the sphere.
Landree 40:13
'Did you say ""your"" sphere?'
Brian 40:15
She's incredibly perplexed. And the conversation kind of continues a little bit without acknowledging that you guys really don't have any idea what's going on. She kind of sees the orb. And again, she's not really acknowledging that you guys don't know what's going on here. 'She had it on her person.'
Ned 40:33
'It was inside the wrapping, inside her hands.'
Brian 40:38
'Why? We dismissed that object to Mr. Alfonso months ago.'
Andrew 40:43
'We recovered it from inside the krasis.'
Brian 40:46
'I'm so sorry. You must be very confused.'
Andrew 40:49
'How could it have leapt from her possession into it?'
Brian 40:52
'It is not ours, before you begin to suspect our involvement. We found it, but it is not ours. We were doing some routine excavation at the bottom of the well. When we found this strange metallic orb in the clutches of a piece of organism. Wrapped around it was a severed black tentacle, ink like you described and yet rigid and more corporeal. We at the Simic have no desire to study the inorganic. We were far more concerned with whatever organism this tentacle had come from. I called Mr. Alfonso because, well, that's what one does when you have an artifact you cannot identify. We dismissed the orb into his collection months ago. I'm very concerned it somehow found its way from his possession into the hands of the Dimir with the intent of bringing it back here.'
Landree 41:44
What's curious to me though, as well as that, if this was where it was originally discovered, and there wasn't an issue of outbreak before...
Andrew 41:51
'It seems he had some kind of trouble upon acquiring his train. We've discovered half of it on the tracks leading away back towards the Boros precinct, where there was, it appeared, a outbreak of a different kind.'
Brian 41:51
'We did not keep it here for very long. I studied it for maybe about five minutes. It seemed nothing more than a metal orb. I called Mr. Alfonso just out of courtesy. He spent a great deal of money purchasing a train and bribing the Izzet to let him use their rail line to get down here, solely so he could have a research facility on site.'
'The captain of our sentries did make a comment that he had made quite a fuss, something about part of his train simply disappearing. You'll have to excuse me, these things don't seem to matter in the moment. But now that I'm putting pieces together, I'm quite confused.'
Andrew 42:41
'If we could speak with Mr. Alfonso, if you have the power to summon him to us.'
Brian 42:47
'I imagine with only half a train, he's trapped in the lockdown like the rest of us. I know Xavi spends a great deal of time with him. Perhaps she can locate him for you. Parax, would you please do me the courtesy of supervising this situation? Just in case there's more to Mr. Alfonso then we thought.'
Ned 43:05
Sure.
Andrew 43:05
'And at this point, I would say it's rather likely.'
Brian 43:08
'Please rest up. I must return to my duties and salvage what I can of my research station.'
Andrew 43:09
'When you have a moment...'
Brian 43:16
'Yes?'
Andrew 43:16
'I would appreciate a private audience, if you've the time.'
Brian 43:20
'I have one now if it is truly important. As for the rest of you, please take all the time that you need.' You all may finally take a long rest and, congratulations, you have leveled up to level three!
Lorzatch, there is obviously the second room to that antechamber and she simply leads you around to her left and gives you a private area. As soon as you get inside, she makes it clear, like, our facility is made out of gooey mucus, sound isn't going anywhere. 'Now what is it you'd like to discuss?'
Andrew 43:54
'I cannot claim to speak for all the members of my swarm and so I cannot apologize their behavior. But I certainly hope that you can and will allow me the chance to broker a peace between the reclamation parties that are building through your territory and with the zonot which you command.'
Brian 44:12
'I appreciate your compassion. It is troubling that your guild, being what it is and having the history that it has, should be so willing to be first in line to break the Guildpact. Again. One positive note of the lockdown is that it seems unlikely the Golgari will be able to remount any of their aggressive efforts. Make no mistake, I hold all three of your opposing guilds in equal severity. The Boros are trying to flex their military muscle, pretending that they have the authority of the Azorius. The Izzet are trying very hard to broker a deal using their power plant. The Golgari, however, seem to be taking the low road. As cultured as your guild claims to be, they have a tendency to lead towards the sword more than anything else. Since you are unaware of the actions of your guild, I will enlighten you: the Golgari are trying to breach us from underground through the walls of the well. I can only assume they're attempting to cut us off from our underground waterways. What they are doing is more dangerous than they know, for they are now between us and the krasis. With the lockdown, it seems unlikely that we will be able to communicate with them. But make no mistake, the minute the quarantine is over, I will expect you to make contact. For now I will consider you an ally. But do not think that I won't hesitate to use you against your own guild.'
Andrew 45:41
'Everything I've come to expect. Tragedy, really. I've always thought that we've had more to gain by working together than against each other. Ours is a more circular path. I like to think that we walk the same one.' And Lorzatch leaves.
Brian 45:53
'It is unfortunate that the elven cultures have taken such... conscientious splits in evolution.'
Andrew 46:01
'But isn't divergence always the way?'
Brian 46:05
'Quite right. Rest up. If you need anything else, please consult my assistants. Thank you, under-citizen.' So I would imagine, after what has happened, that you are going to take the remainder of the day to rest. By the time you end a long rest, it will be time to retire for the day anyway, so getting a full day's rest and, as Andrew had mentioned before, kind of being out of the fire for a day to just sort of loaf and recover might be very healthy. You do have a situation of a less egregious kind to deal with at the moment. You are quarantined within this Simic compound. What would you like to do?
Eddie 46:45
I think we should go talk to Mr. Alfonso.
Sarah 46:47
Oh, yeah, let's... let's go beat that fucker up.
Brian 46:51
Oh, okay.
Sarah 46:52
I mean, talk to that guy.
Brian 46:53
It's a very aggressive opinion.
Andrew 46:56
He's here. We should do that while he's here.
Landree 46:58
Yes.
Andrew 46:59
Okay.
Sarah 46:59
In theory, he's here.
Ned 47:01
Can't get out now.
Andrew 47:02
Yeah, it's locked down.
Brian 47:03
All it takes is a simple summoning of--
Landree 47:05
Xavi?
Brian 47:06
Xavi. She goes, 'Yes, I remember you saying that Mr. Alfonso might be in danger. I do happen to know where his train is located. If you'd like me to send you there...?'
Sarah 47:18
'Please, that would be lovely.'
Brian 47:19
She gives you some directions. Parax, his train is located at the very end of the Izzet line on the far end of the compound, which does in fact end inside the compound, because their Izzet line connects directly to their research station so you can get to it from inside the walls of the lockdown. So it takes you about half the morning to kind of huff your way over there. One of the big distinguished differences is that the Izzet have managed to build into the compound so they still have the ability to ship in and out. At the moment, no, because the quarantine is down, but whatever debate has happened, they were clearly here far before the Boros even tried to queue in and make this power play. At the very end of the line, where there is no more construction, is the back half of a train that looks like the missing piece of the one that you found on a completely different rail line. You happen to see some remnants of scribbling yellow calligraphy as you approach that will be the back half that says 'Of Wonder!'
Andrew 48:22
What did we find in the first place? M-U-E-R?
Brian 48:26
E-R, ER was on the opposite side. So this is the same side that you had found M-U, a bunch of scored in the middle... 'of wonder.'
Sarah 48:35
Muse of wonder?
Andrew 48:36
Museum.
Sarah 48:37
Oh, you're good at letter stuff.
Brian 48:40
Everybody, give me a Perception check.
Sarah 48:44
Holy fuck.
Brian 48:45
Did we buy some new dice that work?
Sarah 48:47
Yeah.
Andrew 48:49
You're, you're going over here, man.
Eddie 48:51
6.
Brian 48:52
Oh, no.
Landree 48:52
7.
Ned 48:53
8.
Sarah 48:54
I got a 17!
Brian 48:55
I don't know if your horns, like, have, like, sound amplification. But you can we hear somebody sort of, kind of muttering to themselves and moving around inside the train.
Sarah 49:05
'He's in there. Oh, he's in there.'
Brian 49:08
What would you like to do?
Sarah 49:09
Can I kick in the door?
Brian 49:10
Yeah.
Eddie 49:11
Wavin the 44
Brian 49:13
You kick in the door and, very startled, you see this kind of spindly, medium-built older human male.
Andrew 49:22
The same one we passed by.
Brian 49:23
The same one you passed by on the way into the compound exclaiming something to the sentry. He is frail. I think a good sneeze would break him in half. He has a peculiar facial hair situation in which it looked like he tried to grow his mustache all the way around his face, but realized that it had to stop at one point. So he has this nice, beautiful, illustrious barbershop mustache that's stark white that kind of branches out. But then he's decided to kind of curtail his sideburns down up underneath. So not quite the Munchausen but getting there by some weird design.
Andrew 50:05
Ships passing in the night.
Brian 50:06
Yes, it's just, yeah, it kind of gives the pause that says, why didn't you just grow the beard directly into the mustache? But he wanted the definitive mustache and he did have a monocle that just fell and whatever box he was carrying, he just completely dropped to the floor.
Sarah 50:24
Does it explode?
Brian 50:25
No.
Sarah 50:25
Okay.
Brian 50:26
It just, kind of, whatever was in there was glass and is now broken. And he just, 'Oh my! Oh! Who are you? What?'
Sarah 50:32
'Mr. Alfonso?'
Brian 50:33
'Oh, yes, of course. Who are you? You are big.'
Sarah 50:36
'Yeah, I'm a minotaur.'
Brian 50:37
'Yes, I can see that, my dear.'
Sarah 50:39
'Fikarra.'
Brian 50:40
'Hello Fikarra. My I ask what you were doing damaging my train further than it already is?'
Sarah 50:45
'Can you tell me why half of your train was on the Boros line?'
Andrew 50:49
'And why a large number of your former personnel were turned into slavering mutants?'
Sarah 50:54
'Who then attacked people in their homes.'
Brian 50:57
Okay. He, like, kind of now addresses the fact that there's like a crowd of people outside his train yelling for him. And he's like, 'Pardon me, might I...? Yes, I'll come right out. Yes.' And he kind of like asks you to just sort of like, give him some space so he can come out and address you all. And he says, 'Oh, my. There are a lot of you.'
Sarah 51:17
'Yeah.'
Brian 51:18
'Yes, colorful people. Hello.'
Landree 51:22
'I like your facial hair.
Brian 51:23
Oh, thank you, my dear. My name is Rufir Alfonso the Third, artificer extraordinaire, purveyor of the ancient and the unknown. And I welcome you to my Museum of Wonder. Except for that last bit. Sorry, bit of a practiced routine, you know. You seem quite cross.'
Sarah 51:44
'Yep.'
Andrew 51:45
'It's been a rather trying several days. Delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Alfonso the Third. We have a number of questions regarding a certain artifact that I understand was in your possession, for a time at least.'
Brian 51:59
'I see.'
Andrew 52:00
'And a bit of business to do with the second half of your train and the personnel-- former, I suppose-- who we discovered had been transformed into slavering mutants and had a rather spot of bother with them on our way here.'
Sarah 52:15
'That's a polite way to put it.'
Brian 52:15
'Oh.'
'You have information about my missing engine.'
Andrew 52:20
'And one Mr. Gato. If the name rings any bells.'
Brian 52:24
'Well, perhaps we could have some tea. And if I could convince you to just carry a couple of these heavy things toward me, we can find a way to go back to where I'm staying and have a nice conversation.'
Sarah 52:36
Seriously?
Brian 52:36
Yes.
Eddie 52:37
'Let's have a conversation right here.'
Brian 52:39
'Oh, my word. Well, I suppose we're going to talk here then.'

Last time on Encounter Party: through trial and terror, our players have made it to Zonot 4 with the unconscious body of Elasia. There, they discovered their lost Izzet companion otherwise oblivious to the tragedy on the train. Things went from bad to worse as the biomancer Vizarra revealed a startling truth: our players are unknowingly agents of the House Dimir, guild of shadows. With a contaminant on the loose, our players now face the wrath of biomancer Vizarra and the Simic might of Zonot 4, this week on Encounter Party!
Alarm bells are ringing, players, as you begin to connect the pieces that whatever is going on here has something to do with the body of Elasia. Bioluminescent warning lights are flashing everywhere and the shouts of civic guild members are blending into the security alarms that are rippling throughout the zonot. Blocking your exit is master biomancer Vizarra, a mer-woman of science who is currently broken under the fact that for once, she has zero knowledge, and she stares at you with a crippling, flustered, exasperation and says, ""What have you done? What have you brought here?""
Sarah 1:34
""I told you she was a weapon! See? Now we know!""
Landree 1:39
""I don't think we know much of anything since she didn't really fully explain what she was just talking about.""
Brian 1:44
""The entire base of the zonot is under assault by something. It is on lockdown. I cannot get any communication from my scientists that are down there. What in heaven's name did you bring here?""
Sarah 1:57
Was it the woman that did this? Or is the attack from outside?
Brian 2:01
""Can you fight?""
Eddie 2:02
""Yes.""
Brian 2:03
""Then come with me now.""
Sarah 2:05
""Yes, ma'am.""
Brian 2:05
She marches you kind of through this facility and you realize that those sentries that were outside your door a moment ago are not there. There seems to be a complete lack of personnel everywhere.
Ned 2:19
Is there any way that--
Brian 2:20
Yes.
Ned 2:20
Let's say, hypothetically, we'd had a, a premonition that maybe Lavinia was not who we thought back in the day, could we have rolled to catch that? And if so, can I do that now?
Brian 2:23
Wait, what?
Ned 2:33
I don't trust that this is the real person at this point.
Brian 2:36
That who is, who is who?
Ned 2:37
That this master?
Andrew 2:38
Biomancer.
Ned 2:39
Is actually Vizarra.
Brian 2:40
Oh, yeah, dude, Insight, go.
Ned 2:42
Great.
Sarah 2:43
Oh my gosh.
Landree 2:43
That's smart.
Ned 2:45
That is a 14.
Brian 2:46
As far as you can tell, it is who she is.
Ned 2:48
Okay.
Brian 2:48
And she forces you over to this large tomb structure that houses, like, containment pods. And they all look like if a seashell was blowing a bubble. And she's clearly panicking. ""I've lost all communication to the lower levels. Something has happened with that Elasia woman and everyone I've sent down to investigate hasn't reported back. What you are hearing is a bio-contamination alert. This entire zonot is on lockdown for the protection of Ravnica, nothing in, nothing out. I have no one left. If you do not go down there and sort this out, this zonot will be our tomb.""
Sarah 3:29
Yes ma'am.
Ned 3:29
Can we communicate back up once we're down there? Do you have any kind of... two-way radio?
Brian 3:34
She says, she says, ""Yes, there are nodes when you get down there. There are nodules that you can communicate into the wall, you will be able to hear them because they're basically giant eardrums.""
Sarah 3:43
""Yes, ma'am.""
Brian 3:45
""You must get down there and stabilize the situation. I have no idea what's happening. But we must contain it. Purge the damn thing if you have to. If we cannot break the lock down, then we are all going to die.""
Ned 3:59
Is there anything down there we have to be worried about and is there anyone we have to make sure we protect?
Brian 4:03
""My scientists.""
Ned 4:04
Okay.
Sarah 4:05
Yes, ma'am.
Ned 4:05
Which answer was that? To which question?
Sarah 4:08
Yes.
Brian 4:09
Both. So she kind of leads you guys into this sort of like tube that can only be kind of described as sort of like the inside of a shell. You are shoved into this capsule. And before you can offer any more protest, it closes around you. And you hear this sort of gross [slurp] as you plunge down into the darkness. And you descend for a solid 20 seconds of creepy silence as your capsule plunges down into the bottom of the zonot to wherever Vizarra had sent you to go. And as you reach that floor, there's no welcome sound. There's no welcome commotion. The capsule just opens into this freaky quiet blackness. Although if you have darkvision, you're fine.
Ned 5:00
I do not.
Brian 5:02
This is one of those moments where Andrew is just like, 'I have everything needed to survive here.'
Ned 5:07
I have nothing.
Eddie 5:08
I cast Light on my shield.
Brian 5:10
Great.
Andrew 5:10
Agh.
Landree 5:10
And I cast Dancing Lights.
Andrew 5:12
Agh.
Brian 5:15
Yes, and the, and the undercity elf goes, 'Agh. Ow.'
You exit now, you have just cast Light on your shield, which would exact, how much feet does that get you?
Eddie 5:27
I believe it's 20 feet. But let me check, oh, 20 foot, bright light for 20 feet and then dim light for another 20 feet.
Brian 5:33
Okay, so as part of the rules of light, there are certain obstructions to it. And that is a fantastic spell that is going to give you guys vision. But as you can see from the map, this place is not only cavernous, but at the same time it's very isolating.
Ned 5:45
Right.
Brian 5:45
You pop in and out into a room that is not very much larger than the five of you kind of put together, there seems to be a great number of safety protocols put in place with a certain number of barriers, you do see a particular portal that leads out into the water, you are now deep enough underwater that the light isn't going to help you. And there is sort of a different color film over this window, than, than this sort of orifice that you may have seen in other places, either because you're darker down in the water or there is some sort of security filament over the side of it. But as of right now you are in a very claustrophobic, very dark, very quiet part of the deep. The only salvation you have at this moment is Lennox's shield.
Landree 6:34
I also cast Dancing Lights, just so we have a few more.
Ned 6:38
Can those go at range?
Landree 6:39
Yes.
Ned 6:40
Oh.
Brian 6:40
Yes, those can be moved around. You get four?
Landree 6:42
I do get four.
Ned 6:43
I really appreciate the two of you right now.
Landree 6:45
I can also turn it into a humanoid shape.
Ned 6:48
That's horrifying. Awesome.
Brian 6:51
Great.
Eddie 6:52
What is the duration of that spell?
Landree 6:54
Up to a minute, but it's a cantrip, so...
Brian 6:57
So she can continually cast it.
Ned 6:58
I feel like Lennox should be taking the lead so that no one's blocking said light.
Andrew 7:02
Agreed.
Eddie 7:03
So I walk up to the entrance of this room or the exit of this room. Is it a door?
Brian 7:10
Yeah.
Eddie 7:10
I open it.
Brian 7:11
You know, the whole thing is sort of like an underground mushroom in shape. And everything sort of bulges out into the water for structural purposes because you want that sort of concave dome to protect against the water pressure. You open the door, it's even quieter on the other side. But you are beginning to hear the faint drips of water, perhaps a bit of a faucet of water. There is just sort of the unsettling presence of water everywhere. I walk into the room. As you walk into the room, can I please have a Perception check?
Ned 7:46
I was gonna say, we gonna need some Perception on this one.
Sarah 7:49
Yeah.
Eddie 7:50
[dice roll, helpless laughter]
Ned 7:51
Oof. I got a passive that could be helpful someday.
Eddie 7:56
It's not so good.
Brian 8:00
'I rolled a six.'
Eddie 8:01
Well I, it's six with my, six, the number is six.
Brian 8:04
You really can't see anything. But you can feel that there might be a drop off in front of you.
Eddie 8:11
With my light, I can't see anything?
Brian 8:13
The fact that you rolled a six is actually more descriptive than you think. Because your light sort of extends out. And you don't see a wall in front of you. Your light just sort of extends out to its range. And then just finishes...
Eddie 8:27
In just like a void.
Brian 8:28
In the dark.
Eddie 8:29
Okay.
Brian 8:29
It could very well be just a straight-up void in front of you, as far as you can see.
Eddie 8:33
But, beneath me? There's floor?
Brian 8:38
Directly under your feet, yes, there is floor.
Ned 8:40
There's no drop-off.
Brian 8:41
But I would say about 20 feet in front of you, it looks like that floor ends and in front of you there is no wall where that floor ends.
Eddie 8:48
Got it got it.
Brian 8:48
Yeah, as you, as you walk a little bit more and your light sort of adjusts with the frame of reference here, where are we going, you can now see that sort of the edge of where you are there is a railing. And the lip that peers down some distance and that there is sort of a, you're on a bit of an overlook. What is down there, I don't know that you can tell. But there is some sort of cavernous place within the structure you are in that extends out and down from you.
Eddie 9:17
""Could you send those lights of yours down there so we can see what's going on?""
Landree 9:24
""Absolutely. Their name is Frank.""
Ned 9:25
'Sup Frank.
Brian 9:26
All four of them?
Ned 9:28
They are collectively Frank?
Brian 9:29
As a collective, they are Frank.
Ned 9:30
Frank one through four, or is each one also equivocally Frank?
Landree 9:35
They, they are Frank.
Yes.
Ned 9:36
Copy.
Brian 9:37
Is there a Frank Prime out of the four?
Landree 9:39
I don't play favorites.
Brian 9:43
I love it. So could everybody please at least sort of form of marching order or position yourselves as to where you would be in the room?
Eddie 9:51
So where, is this where this drop off is?
Brian 9:55
Yes.
Eddie 9:56
So I guess I was standing right here.
Brian 9:57
Yes.
Sarah 9:58
I'm kind of okay with holding up the back and kind of making sure there's nothing coming behind us.
Brian 10:02
You also can... Well, that is one of the things that you observe about where you are, is that the only way into the room you have just come from are those tubes, those tubes that are now very obviously inaccessible because of a lack of power here, this second room that you've gone into, there is no way out of that room either. The only way, the only place that this room kind of ends is an overlook into this area. As Zenia kind of sends Frank out into the area, you can see that about 15 feet below you is what looks to be like a tank, almost like a it's a pool of water. And there is in fact a ladder that goes down. But there, as far as you can see, you're kind of stuck in an area with elevators you can't return from and this sort of overlook into this sort of pool area.
Ned 10:58
Can we tell how deep it looks?
Brian 10:59
How deep the pool looks? You cannot tell that. But it is only, the pool is only a section of that descent. There is clearly some sort of, there's medical equipment down there. There's observation areas, the pool.
Eddie 11:13
I begin to climb down the ladder.
Brian 11:15
Okay, you climb down the ladder.
Ned 11:16
I'ma take out my crossbow, just in case something happens
Brian 11:18
You're going to take out your crossbow.
Ned 11:19
While you're doing the thing.
Brian 11:20
What is everybody else doing?
Landree 11:21
Zenia follows Lennox.
Brian 11:23
Okay, could you please position yourself where you are, you guys could go position yourself down on the map.
Ned 11:28
Crossbowing at the top.
Brian 11:29
As you guys touch down, you can hear your feet and feel your feet touch water. There is sort of an ankle-deep pool of water over the top of this pool. And you can hear sort of the cavernous drips of water but you also hear streams of water that make you kind of nervous about what is possibly pressuring water into this area. And as you pause to try and hunt with your ears as to what sort of aqua-danger you might be, you hear a sound [quiet hissing]
You can freeze and then at a slightly different part of the room you just hear [quiet hissing]
Eddie 12:20
I point my light in the direction of the sound.
Brian 12:22
Great.
Landree 12:23
I send Frank in the direction of the other sound.
Andrew 12:27
Lorzatch begins climbing down.
Ned 12:29
What's, what's the distance probably from the top of the ladder to the bottom of the ladder?
Brian 12:32
15 feet.
Ned 12:32
Thank you.
Brian 12:33
And you guys standing up will not have heard this. It is, it is only audible to the people who are down there. Could you please give me a little bit of a clear description of what you're doing with your shield?
Eddie 12:43
My shield is out in front of me and I swing it around.
Brian 12:46
Great.
Eddie 12:46
Directly into the direction of where I heard this ominous sound.
Brian 12:50
I need you to make a Wisdom saving throw please.
Eddie 12:54
22.
Brian 12:54
A 22.
Landree 12:56
15.
Brian 12:57
So as you kind of turn your shield around, right when you can kind of hit your shield around at the apex, you just see a massive yellow amphibian eye that just seems to kind of come out of nowhere and it blinks at you and tries to hit you with some sort of paralyzing stare but perhaps your shield or perhaps the light is just too much for it to get focused. And it immediately sort of like hides away and disappears--
Ned 13:23
Can we see this?
Brian 13:23
With some sort of prismatic thing. No, but everybody can please roll Initiative. Let's roll Initiative!
Ned 13:31
I was like, how do I have Armor Class 20?
Brian 13:33
You guys are now being pursued by something, you are welcome to act, audibly, before, if anybody wants to do anything.
Eddie 13:39
I, yeah, I'll get down here and I walk up to that creature that tried to do something nasty to me and I smack it with my mace.
Brian 13:46
You can on your turn. Lorzatch, you're up first.
Andrew 13:51
All right. Lorzatch, Lorzatch has climbed down the ladder. Is there anything visible?
Brian 13:55
So I would say climbing down the ladder would have to be your action to get down there because the events that happened when they came down at the bottom were quickly with them making an Investigation check, so I would say you wouldn't have been on this encounter, but climbing is half speed so you could easily make it down the ladder in, in one movement.
Andrew 14:13
He climbs.
Brian 14:13
You climb down, you're at the bottom. That's just your movement, so you can still...
Andrew 14:17
Lorzatch will--
Brian 14:18
As of right now you cannot see it.
Andrew 14:21
Lorzatch will, as an action, awaken spores.
Eddie 14:24
Where is--
Brian 14:26
Fikarra, it is your turn.
Sarah 14:27
I'm going to jump down out of the way.
Brian 14:30
Oh.
Ned 14:30
We'll have to look up the falling damage rules.
Brian 14:32
You can just climb down for free. Look, I appreciate your desire to try and do something cool but your rules are going to not make that cool.
Ned 14:40
Superhero entrance! Superhero entrance!
Brian 14:42
Like, like, like mister, like Mr. I'm-Going-to-Leap-this-Table-to-Stab-this-Dude.
Ned 14:44
It worked!
Brian 14:48
No, you missed him.
Ned 14:49
Yeah, but I leaped the table.
Landree 14:50
You did leap the table.
Brian 14:51
So.
Sarah 14:52
Okay, I'll just go down.
Brian 14:54
Okay.
Sarah 14:55
So that's just my full turn then, or?
Brian 14:58
Your full movement.
Sarah 14:59
Okay.
Brian 14:59
Would be climbing down.
Sarah 15:00
Oh, okay, movement then. Alright. So I'll just be like, 'Hey guys, what's up?'
Brian 15:03
Something is down there.
Sarah 15:05
Okay.
Brian 15:05
You heard your companion say something, you heard some sort of splashing around.
Sarah 15:11
Yeah, I can't Vicious Mockery him if I can't see it, right?
Brian 15:14
No, I think you can. I think you can throw... I think you can throw something at them, but they have to have a certain Intelligence level to understand the mockery, I think.
Eddie 15:25
If you're down here, can they now see it because I've shone, shined my light on it?
Brian 15:28
None of you can see it.
Eddie 15:29
Oh, I thought--
Ned 15:29
It disappeared.
Brian 15:30
It disappeared.
Eddie 15:30
Oh it disappeared.
Brian 15:31
Yeah.
Eddie 15:32
Thank you. I'm sorry. I didn't understand.
Brian 15:33
Yes, just, you just saw an eye.
Landree 15:35
And Frank didn't illuminate anything?
Brian 15:38
Frank, you, I would say Frank is equally dispersed around the room. You have your shield. At the moment it is not visible.
Ned 15:45
And the room is--
Eddie 15:46
And the room is fully illuminated.
Ned 15:48
Fully illuminated.
Eddie 15:48
We can see everything in the room.
Brian 15:49
Yes, and you can, you can still hear the [quiet hissing] But it's difficult to place at the moment.
Sarah 15:56
You know what, I'll do Vicious Mockery and like, 'Where are you, you little monsters, just climbing around and being a big cowardy monster thing. We're really awesome. And we're going to beat you up and you should probably just show yourself right now.'
Ned 16:11
From the top of the ladder. ""Yeah!""
Andrew 16:14
Got 'em.
Brian 16:15
What is the saving throw on this?
Sarah 16:16
The saving throw on that is CON 13.
Andrew 16:21
It's not coming back from that.
Brian 16:22
You hear some puttering around.
Andrew 16:25
It's cancelled.
Brian 16:26
Make me a Perception check please.
Sarah 16:28
Oh, no. Oh, okay. It's a 10.
Brian 16:31
You, you can see some pattering. It's about 20 feet away from you.
Sarah 16:36
""Guys. Guys. Guys, guys. 20 feet right ahead of me. 12 o'clock. It's getting around. It's real shook up. Oh, man. It's real shook up.""
Eddie 16:45
Do I, do we see the water being disturbed?
Brian 16:56
You're about to see the water be disturbed as you kind of hear and see a little splash splash and then off to everyone's right, almost to the wall, you see this big eyeball about twice the size of a basketball just sort of come out of the ether and just flash yellow. Would everybody please make a Wisdom saving throw?
Ned 17:13
Including me if I'm up above?
Brian 17:15
If you're up above, no.
Ned 17:16
Okay.
Eddie 17:16
Ooh, that's not good for good old Lennox.
Landree 17:21
If I have advantage, can I roll twice and take the...
Brian 17:25
Yeah.
Landree 17:25
Yes, great. That's what I thought. Fantastic.
Brian 17:28
Great. Did anybody not hit a 12?
Eddie 17:31
Yeah, I rolled a one.
Brian 17:34
Yeah.
Sarah 17:35
I have a zero.
Brian 17:36
Okay, this paralyzing stare hits you full on in the face. You are now stunned. You can't move, you can only speak falteringly. You will fail any Strength or Dexterity saving throws and attacks against you have advantage.
Sarah 17:52
Well, balls.
Brian 17:54
Yes.
Andrew 17:54
Will the monster in question take a Constitution saving throw?
Brian 17:57
The monster in question will make a Constitution saving throw. A 7.
Andrew 18:02
The monster takes 4 necrotic damage.
Brian 18:05
Oh-ho, the spores. With that, how, describe to me in some detail how this spore is going to affect that creature so that we can see whether or not you see it. I would say that you, Lorzatch, alone can at least immediately sense it and if you probably have spores inside of it, now you're going to be able to track it. The question is whether or not that ability communicates anything to anyone else.
Andrew 18:31
The spores seek to find purchase inside the body and start propagating and taking root in the flesh and extending cilia and filaments inside to where things start getting interesting and nourishing.
Brian 18:45
From inside the creature?
Andrew 18:46
Yep.
Brian 18:46
Okay, at the moment you can track it, but whatever you are doing internally to it does not seem to affect the outside.
Andrew 18:53
Being stunned, Lorzatch says nothing.
Brian 18:55
True.
Ned 18:57
That's so upsetting.
Brian 18:58
Lennox, you are also stunned.
Eddie 19:00
Is it my turn?
Brian 19:01
Yes.
Eddie 19:02
I'm going to try to be un-stunned.
Brian 19:04
Okay.
Eddie 19:06
I rolled not enough.
Andrew 19:10
What is the target for Wisdom saving throw?
Brian 19:12
A 12.
Andrew 19:13
12.
Eddie 19:13
I rolled a 9.
Brian 19:13
So, Zenia, you have a general idea of where an eyeball just was. Two of your companions seem dumbstruck by whatever just happened. And you can kind of see them both out of the cover their eyes, they're sort of [disoriented moaning] they've got the, like the chicks swirling around their head. You are free to make an action please.
Landree 19:34
Fantastic, um, I cast Chill Touch and--
Brian 19:37
If you are going to make an attack roll, you have it at disadvantage.
Landree 19:42
Oh my god. Okay.
Brian 19:43
Chill Touch does not, I keep, there's like so many things with touch, but you don't actually have to touch.
Andrew 19:46
No, this is 120 feet.
Landree 19:48
Yeah.
Brian 19:48
Please go, but with disadvantage,
Eddie 19:50
Very misleading. I don't know why they would call it that.
Landree 19:53
17.
Brian 19:54
You hit.
Landree 19:55
Nice. For three points of necrotic damage.
Brian 19:59
You hear a squeal like [squeal] and you can see footprints pitter-pattering around.
Landree 20:05
Can I ask, since I do have experience underwater, like is this at all familiar to me? Is this creature anything I could potentially recognize by the eyeball?
Brian 20:13
Oh no, you're in the middle of a Simic compound. Whatever this is, it doesn't even have a name. But you do very clearly see the pitter-patter and the running feet of whatever this is. There are four feet and while it does still have some sort of invisibility cloaking thing going on to it, you can see enough of it that you can make an attack roll, you're just at a disadvantage as of right now when you make attack rolls.
Landree 20:37
Okay.
Brian 20:37
Whose turn is it? Uh, Brevin, you're up.
Ned 20:39
So I am immediately launching a crossbow bolt right at wherever I last saw the pitter-patter.
Brian 20:44
Please do.
Ned 20:46
It's not wonderful. 13.
Brian 20:50
A 13 will not hit.
Ned 20:51
Okay, I'm not coming down there.
Brian 20:53
Okay, Lorzatch, you're up.
Andrew 20:56
Lorzatch will roll to stop being stunned. And Lorzatch rolls a 16.
Brian 21:03
You are no longer stunned.
Landree 21:05
Nice.
Andrew 21:05
Is that the--
Brian 21:06
You are also immune to being stunned for the next 24 hours. That's a common way those things operate, Eddie, for being frustrated, but stunned and unable to say anything.
Andrew 21:16
Is that the full action or can you take an action after rolling for this?
Brian 21:20
At the end of your turn, it, you can usually make those throws at the end of your turn.
Ned 21:25
So you took a turn of stun and now you're un-stunned.
Brian 21:27
Yes.
Andrew 21:27
Got it. Great. Then that is the turn.
Brian 21:29
Great. Fikarra, you are back up.
Sarah 21:31
Let's try to make a Wisdom--
Ned 21:33
Believe in you, girl.
Sarah 21:34
Saving, right?
Brian 21:35
Are you also stunned?
Sarah 21:36
Yeah, I rolled a 0.
Brian 21:38
Oh. You're still exhausted.
Sarah 21:40
No, we had a rest.
Brian 21:41
You had a long rest in the train.
Sarah 21:43
So we're good.
Brian 21:44
Oh, so you just rolled poorly.
Ned 21:45
Yeah.
Brian 21:46
Great.
Sarah 21:46
I rolled a 0.
Ned 21:47
She's got a negative modifier.
Brian 21:47
Please continue.
Sarah 21:48
Yeah.
Ned 21:49
It's not ideal.
Sarah 21:49
No, not the best.
Ned 21:52
How we living?
Sarah 21:53
Oh, 7.
Brian 21:53
Not enough.
Sarah 21:54
No.
Brian 21:54
You need to roll a 12. It is the creature's turn.
Sarah 21:56
It's feeling very insulted though.
Brian 21:57
Eddie, you're just looking stunned so you can, in your stun-state, you can just see the splash splash splash splash as the thing comes reaching for you-- son of a bitch.
Andrew 22:07
Will it please--
Brian 22:08
It will make a Constitution saving throw.
Ranged creatures from now on, ladies and gentlemen. It rolled a 16.
Andrew 22:17
It saves.
Brian 22:19
Okay. And eventually I think the monsters are just going to be tough enough that they're like 'Constitution?'
Andrew 22:24
'28.'
'Ooh.'
'Nerd.'
Brian 22:28
Lennox, although you can't see it, you can feel this large like massive dog-size thing coming at you through the dark and it is going to attack you even though you can't see it. The first roll is a 1 so that's not going to do anything but the second one is a 16.
Eddie 22:45
I mean, I, my Armor Class is usually 18. I don't know what it is now, being stunned.
Brian 22:50
It does not, unless the shield is disarming, there is no indication that a status effect removes the shield from you unless it is particular things. Because even if say you were to fall prone there's nothing that says you don't fall down with your shield over the top of you. If you are disarmed, no, so your Armor Class is...
Eddie 23:07
18.
Brian 23:09
18. So you can, you can feel what is clearly a claw and then some sort of mouth that finds purchase but your armor is a bit too tough for it at this particular state. It is now your turn to go, Lennox.
Eddie 23:22
Yes! I am no longer stunned. It's 12, right?
Brian 23:26
12.
Eddie 23:26
Yes.
Brian 23:27
Congratulations.
Eddie 23:27
We're at 14.
Brian 23:28
Great. You are no longer stunned. Zenia.
Landree 23:30
Okay, um, I'd like to, for my bonus action, I'd like to merge Frank into a humanoid figure.
Brian 23:39
Okay.
Landree 23:39
And have him kind of be around where the pattering is.
Brian 23:43
Yes. So he is only about 12 to 15 feet in front of you.
Landree 23:47
No problem.
Brian 23:48
And he is, he is helping sort of illuminate even more clearly where this pattering is, it's just difficult to discern the actual shape of this thing which still keeps you at a disadvantage unfortunately.
Landree 24:01
I'd like to, I'd like to cast kill, Chill Touch again.
Brian 24:05
I thought you just said 'Kill Touch.'
Ned 24:06
Yeah.
Brian 24:06
And I was like, that seems really unfair at Level 2.
Landree 24:10
I'd like to cast Kill Touch. Chill Touch. Oh god damn it. 9.
Brian 24:15
A 9 will not hit.
Landree 24:17
Yeah.
Brian 24:18
Brevin, you're up.
Ned 24:19
So I don't like invisible monsters. They don't make sense to me. So I'm going to take with the Ready Action and just have the bow ready to fire the moment either of those eyes opens.
Brian 24:27
Okay, top of the order. Lorzatch.
Andrew 24:28
Lorzatch will...
Brian 24:30
It is however far away it needs to be to not need to make a Constitution saving throw the beginning of its turn, which is, which is 15 feet I'm assuming it needs to be. If it's, if it's within 10.
Ned 24:42
It's within 10, yeah.
Brian 24:43
Yeah. So it's intelligent enough to kind of keep its distance at least for the moment as it seems to be learning.
Andrew 24:49
Lorzatch closes distance.
Brian 24:51
Son of a bitch.
Andrew 24:52
To what he, to what he thinks might be the location of this semi-visible creature.
Brian 24:58
Yes.
Andrew 24:58
And swings with both a scimitar and a dagger.
Brian 25:03
Yes. Not likely.
Andrew 25:06
A 13.
Brian 25:07
No.
Andrew 25:08
And 14 to hit.
Brian 25:10
No.
Andrew 25:10
That's a whiff.
Brian 25:11
Barely. Yeah, so you confidently strut out into the ankle-deep water, pretty certain you knew where this thing was, and with a quick swipe, swipe, you just hear 'patter-patter-patter.'
AD BREAK
Brian 25:59
Fikarra.
Sarah 26:00
I would like to roll see if I'm un-stunned.
Brian 26:03
Yes please.
Sarah 26:05
7.
Brian 26:06
No. You need new dice. Here.
Ned 26:08
I have two more sets if we need to swap out.
Brian 26:10
I believe it is within your space. So once again my Dungeon Master creation will make a Constitution saving throw. It makes a 22.
Andrew 26:21
It saves.
Brian 26:23
That was a pretty high roll. Lorzatch, it will attack you directly.
Ned 26:27
Does this attack cause it to become visible in any way?
Brian 26:30
No.
Ned 26:31
Okay.
Brian 26:31
But I don't think it will hit you. I have a 14 and a 6.
Andrew 26:37
No.
Ned 26:38
No.
Andrew 26:38
They do not hit.
Brian 26:39
Okay. Continuing on. Eddie.
Eddie 26:43
Lennox joins the fray and swings his mace.
Brian 26:46
Yes. At a disadvantage please. It is invisible.
Eddie 26:50
At a disadvantage.
Brian 26:52
Or cloaked.
Eddie 26:53
Yeah, I believe that is a no-go.
Brian 26:55
It is a no-go. You're up, Zenia.
Landree 27:00
I am not leaving Chill Touch. This is my jam today. Okay. So it would be 16.
Brian 27:08
Yes, you hit.
Landree 27:10
One point of necrotic damage.
Brian 27:11
One point of necrotic damage is enough. What you see is this large aquatic dog-sized creature start blinking in and out of visibility and it has this massive yellow eyeball on the front of it darting all around trying to find some way to escape this situation. But of course there's nowhere for it to go and whatever invisibility, cloaking-type skin that it has, that's beginning to fail as it dies as, again, it just starts blinking here and there. It has these large pink frills on the side of the eyeball that are flittering in panic in and out, in and out, as the whole thing staggers around and splashes before sort of pathetically crumpling down into the pool of water below it, and there it lies, seemingly dead-- until it begins to boil. As the underneath the skin starts sputtering and spewing this black ooze and the whole creature sort of blossoms into this sickening tar flower and it goes completely John Carpenter: long crab crustacean legs start pouring out of this thing and grabbing purchase onto the ground. And as it seemingly turns itself inside out, you can see two arms and a torso and a head in this grotesque crab centaur-like creature as it clearly attempts to morph into what ever just killed it, into this grotesque mimicry of you guys as humanoids. Ned, would you now please make your readied attack roll.
Ned 28:50
Nat 20.
Brian 28:53
Well, well there you go.
Landree 28:55
Yes.
Eddie 28:55
C'mon now. Yeah.
Brian 28:56
Please do some damage.
Ned 28:58
You double damage, right?
Brian 28:59
You get an extra damage die.
Ned 29:02
Right, okay. 8.
Landree 29:04
Sweet.
Brian 29:05
It is an eight in damage. Great.
Ned 29:08
Could've been better. I rolled d8s.
Brian 29:09
You, you attacked it with your crossbow?
Ned 29:12
Yeah.
Brian 29:12
As you shoot it, you hear as, as the bolt punctures it in the chesticle area.
You very audibly in this sort of aqua- echo chamber hear a metallic 'ting' as if it punctured flesh but hit something metal.
Landree 29:34
Oh no.
Ned 29:34
Dope. And by 'dope' I mean 'terrible.' I'm launching crossbow after crossbow, I'm not coming down there. Screw you guys.
Brian 29:39
Please do.
Ned 29:41
That is a 19.
Brian 29:42
19 does damage.
Ned 29:43
Okay it does 2 points of damage which is not that cool, but I'm gonna take Action Surge and fire again.
Brian 29:49
Okay.
Ned 29:53
Natural one, so could have gone better.
Brian 29:58
A bit... A bit over-zealous.
Landree 30:00
I like how you phrased that though.
Brian 30:02
Top of the order. Lorzatch.
Andrew 30:04
Lorzatch swings with a scimitar and a dagger.
Eddie 30:07
I love Lorzatch.
Ned 30:08
Yeah.
Landree 30:08
I do too.
Andrew 30:12
Does an 11 hit?
Brian 30:14
No.
Andrew 30:14
How about an 18?
Brian 30:15
An 18 does hit.
Landree 30:16
Yes.
Andrew 30:16
Great. Great. 10 damage.
Brian 30:22
10 damage.
Andrew 30:22
Including 5 poison damage.
Brian 30:25
An additional five? So 15 total?
Or five of that damage is poison?
Andrew 30:27
No, no, no.
Five of that damage.
Brian 30:29
Five of that damage.
Andrew 30:30
Is poison.
Brian 30:31
Is poison.
Landree 30:31
That's nice.
Brian 30:32
You're making some serious attacks. This thing is taller than you and sort of aggravatingly just sort of like not even aware that it's being struck. It just seems mad. Fikarra, you are up.
Sarah 30:43
Am I still stunned? Okay.
Brian 30:45
Do it.
Sarah 30:46
I'ma be not stunned. It's gonna happen.
Brian 30:48
You have teammates that can help you.
Sarah 30:50
I rolled a 3.
Brian 30:51
You are still stunned.
Eddie 30:53
But we can assist her?
Brian 30:55
There are people who have abilities and Inspiration that can be shared.
Ned 30:58
I can't.
Sarah 30:59
Oh wait, the Inspiration, right. Yeah, I'd like to be un-stunned, because that would be cool.
Eddie 31:07
Aw.
Sarah 31:07
I'm gonna go crawl into a little... somewhere.
I rolled a 7.
Brian 31:08
Oh no. It's far too frightening for the Boros minotaur, who's underwater and just, 'oh god what's going on? I can't handle, I don't want my fur to get wet!'
So now it is going to swing at Lennox and Lorzatch. It sort of rises almost another half its own body in height and comes down really, really hard, trying to bite Lennox while at the same time trying to swipe at Lorzatch. So Lennox-- yes, yes, it began its turn...
Within your spores. It rolled a 10.
Andrew 31:44
[laughing]
And it takes 7 necrotic damage.
Brian 31:51
7 necrotic damage. I will attempt to resume my turn. The bite attack against Lennox is an 18.
Eddie 32:01
Curses.
Brian 32:02
And the claw attack, Lorzatch, does a 12 hit?
Andrew 32:05
It does not.
Brian 32:07
Eddie. You get a big old chunk bitten out of you.
Eddie 32:12
""Agh!""
Brian 32:13
And you take 10 piercing damage.
Eddie 32:17
""Foul beast!""
Brian 32:18
Lennox, you are up, my friend.
Eddie 32:20
Lennox casts, casts Shield of Faith on himself.
Brian 32:25
Okay.
Eddie 32:26
Which is a bonus action. And then he swings his mace.
Brian 32:31
Okay.
Eddie 32:33
So I rolled a 16.
Brian 32:35
A 16 will hit.
Eddie 32:37
Fabulous.
Landree 32:38
Nice.
Brian 32:39
Please roll damage.
Eddie 32:41
7 points of damage.
Brian 32:42
7 points of damage. Great deal of damage. You notice that, as you whack into it, though, that there is something coating its skin and it splashes back.
Eddie 32:50
Of course it does.
Brian 32:52
And you take 1 point of acid damage. Why wouldn't it?
Eddie 32:59
I'm hurting. If it gets another one of those good bites on me, I'm down.
Brian 33:04
Zenia, you are up.
Landree 33:06
Okay, I am going to cast Chaos Bolt.
Brian 33:12
This is my favorite part.
Landree 33:15
14?
Brian 33:17
To hit?
Landree 33:17
Yeah.
Brian 33:18
A 14 will not hit.
Landree 33:19
Damn it.
Ned 33:20
I saw the one on there...
Brian 33:21
I know, Ned's reaction...
Ned 33:21
And then the other number...
Brian 33:25
But...
Landree 33:25
I love that both of you were there. Yes.
Brian 33:27
But you did cast Chaos Bolt, regardless, I will make you roll a d20.
Landree 33:27
Okay. 5.
Brian 33:33
You're fine.
Landree 33:34
Okay.
Brian 33:34
You are still in control of your powers.
Landree 33:36
Okay.
Brian 33:37
Brevin, you're up.
Ned 33:39
We just crossbow-ing for days, man.
Landree 33:40
Yeah.
Ned 33:41
It's not great. We can move on. It's an 8?
Eddie 33:44
Brevin, get down here.
Ned 33:45
No!
Eddie 33:46
You're our Fighter!
Ned 33:47
You have acid!
Brian 33:49
An 8 will not hit. Lorzatch, back, top of the order.
Landree 33:56
[whispering]
Brian 33:56
You can say this stuff out loud.
Ned 33:57
You can talk.
Landree 33:57
Fantastic. I know he's taking damage, but I also know that like, okay, so there's metal, etc. Like, do we know...
Eddie 34:02
Think he probably has some sort of damage reduction.
Landree 34:05
Okay.
Eddie 34:06
It seems like. Maybe.
Ned 34:06
We know nothing.
Landree 34:07
So we don't know what didn't, what actually is the most effective.
Eddie 34:11
We don't. We don't know. Next I'm going to try some radiant damage.
Landree 34:14
Okay.
Andrew 34:15
Random conjecture.
Landree 34:16
Yes.
Andrew 34:17
There is an artifact inside of this thing.
Landree 34:20
Okay.
Andrew 34:20
That is sort of creating these spontaneous adaptations. So we can chip away at its forms. We don't know that this is going to disable whatever is inside-- again, baseless conjecture.
Ned 34:34
Purely from knowing Brian, does that conjecture come out.
Andrew 34:36
I hear something bouncing off of metal... We'll keep an eye out, folks.
Brian 34:42
Metal inside.
Andrew 34:43
Inside of it. Inside of it.
Brian 34:45
Inside of the tissue.
Andrew 34:47
Lorzatch is going to strike with his scimitar. And roll a 22 to hit.
Brian 34:55
Yes, that absolutely hits. Please roll damage.
Eddie 34:59
Oh, max damage.
Andrew 35:02
16 damage.
Brian 35:04
Great. 16 damage.
Andrew 35:06
So, it is...
Ned 35:06
The scimitar gets 2d6?
Andrew 35:08
No, the poison damage.
Brian 35:09
The poison damage.
Andrew 35:10
From his awakened spores.
Ned 35:11
Oh, I was like, 'what the hell?'
Eddie 35:12
That's dope, dude.
Brian 35:13
So you are going to take 1 splash-back damage. 1 acid damage splash-back.
Andrew 35:18
Great. As a bonus action...
Brian 35:20
This die is being retired.
Andrew 35:22
As a bonus action.
Brian 35:23
Yes.
Andrew 35:24
Lorzatch is going to cast Healing Word on Lennox.
Eddie 35:29
Thanks, dude.
Brian 35:30
Great.
Andrew 35:30
And Lennox is going to heal 6 hit points.
Eddie 35:34
Fuck yeah.
Brian 35:35
So your blades cut through in this deep arcing strike. And as you make your way through the second time you hear that distinct metal-on-metal 'clink' as your blade connects with something deep inside this creature and you can feel it dislodge and as soon as it does, your strike finishes and the whole being folds back and sort of buckles down, collapsing onto the ground in this pool of black tar and through this goo you can see laying in the middle of this now-deceased organism is a small, shiny metal orb.
Sarah 36:15
Lasers. Eyes.
Brian 36:17
Also, as you now get a chance to finally look at it, those of you who were at the bar in the Leg End, way back in Episode 1 who got a look at the face of the man who wandered in, the same telltale black vein infection is running through this thing.
Sarah 36:37
Cool. I'm not stunned anymore, right?
Brian 36:40
You are no longer stunned.
Sarah 36:41
Thank you.
Andrew 36:42
I'm checking--
Brian 36:43
At least a minute will pass. It's been less than that. It's like 30 seconds.
Andrew 36:47
So I believe that, based on what's in a poisoner's kit, that Lorzatch has forceps to grab this thing and remove it. From the corpse.
Brian 36:57
Either you do or the, or Zenia does. The scientist.
Andrew 37:01
Great.
Brian 37:01
Either of you have the necessary materials to.
Andrew 37:04
He does not want to touch this with his bare hands.
Brian 37:06
Okay. Would anybody like to move or change their position while they are in there?
Ned 37:10
Yeah, I'll come down now.
Sarah 37:12
It's so nice to, just, I just want to be not stunned and moved around.
Brian 37:18
If we can make sure that Brevin gets to where he intends to be.
Andrew 37:22
And Lorzatch will contain this.
Eddie 37:25
After he takes the thing out.
Brian 37:27
Yes.
Eddie 37:27
I send a blast of... I summon the power of sacred flame just to make sure that it's dead.
Ned 37:36
Just sacred-flame a corpse? I love that.
Eddie 37:41
I want to make sure.
Brian 37:42
You sacred-flame the corpse?
Eddie 37:44
Yes.
Brian 37:45
Roll damage.
Eddie 37:48
1 point of damage.
Landree 37:49
Yeah!
Brian 37:50
It starts to bubble.
Andrew 37:53
Lorzatch is going to contain the orb within this tin box that he keeps.
Brian 37:58
Okay. We're going to assume your box and the orb are of relative size.
Andrew 38:02
We hope.
Brian 38:03
Yeah.
Ned 38:04
You try to close it...
Brian 38:05
I will make an official ruling: yes.
Sarah 38:08
I'm going to just kind of patrol the room like over here.
Brian 38:11
Okay.
Sarah 38:12
I will not be stunned again.
Brian 38:13
Okay.
Ned 38:14
That is...
Landree 38:14
Hopefully we're keeping the initiative though, right?
Brian 38:16
We're maintaining initiative order for the moment, which means that you guys get to make decisions but in the order of initiative.
Landree 38:21
Fantastic. So after he cast sacred fire flame...
Eddie 38:24
Sacred Flame of Anor.
Landree 38:26
Sacred Flame. I cast Detect Magic.
Brian 38:31
Okay.
Landree 38:34
On the orb, on the sphere.
Brian 38:36
There is no magic spell or ward or enchantment on the orb that you can detect.
Landree 38:45
Okay. I'd like to... Well, I think I'll pause there.
Brian 38:50
Okay, Brevin, would you like to do anything?
Ned 38:52
Nah bro.
Brian 38:54
So this mass of goo that you've now squashed twice begins to bubble again. It starts getting violent. And while there is nothing to produce a sound, what you see is bubbles and spurts of what is now this black ichor starts throwing itself violently around--
Ned 39:13
Shield.
Brian 39:13
And black tendrils begin sort of whipping as this thing molds again, evolving into take an even more horrifying shape. You have a reaction to move.
Andrew 39:28
Is there any other way out of this room other than the way we came in?
Brian 39:32
Yes, there is a another ladder mirroring the one that you entered in that's on the far side.
Eddie 39:37
So I start climbing up that ladder.
Brian 39:40
As you make distance from this pool of ichor, the whole pile of tar starts to bubble more violently and dozens of tendrils of black goo start whipping wildly within the air as this whole thing tries to pull itself out of itself. And from inside this pool of goo you can see a massive claw and then another massive claw start morphing and crawling its way out as if the pool itself is almost a portal to its true form. And then comes a massive dragon-like head and yet the whole thing is still covered in this black ichor as wisps and strands of this goo flail all around like a warning sign and out of the pool in another transformation crawls this giant massive black salamander dripping in tar and it is now a huge creature barely able to fit inside of this small claustrophobic chamber. So it is a 3x3-foot space.
Landree 40:51
Easier to hit.
Sarah 40:52
So it probably can't get through the space that's above the ladder.
Brian 40:57
I'm not sure. It hasn't made its way there yet.
Andrew 40:59
Whose turn is it?
Brian 41:01
Who killed-- oh, you killed it. Fikarra, it's your turn.
Sarah 41:04
""Don't worry, everyone, I've got this!"" This is the worst idea I've ever had in my entire life. Okay. Yeah. I just rush through them and [miming mace swings] bang them both.
Brian 41:18
You're going to attack it with your maces?
Sarah 41:20
Yes.
Brian 41:21
You run forward with the fervor--
Sarah 41:23
Of a very angry minotaur.
Brian 41:25
That is expected if the Boros Legion. Screaming, you raise your mace drumsticks high, ready to splatter-punk this sucker all over the floor.
Sarah 41:35
""I'm not stunned anymore, you abomination of stuff!""
Brian 41:40
This is a big setup here.
Sarah 41:45
I'm done. I'm leaving.
Brian 41:47
Oh no!
Landree 41:48
Yeah, it was pretty sad.
Ned 41:50
That's a four and a four?
Brian 41:51
Oh no.
Ned 41:52
A three and a four?
Landree 41:53
A three and a four. Yeah, you gave her a little too much credit.
Eddie 41:55
[commiserating laughter]
Brian 42:01
So you, you, you do, you do kind of connect but it's just like hitting a pail of water it's just [splatter noise].
Sarah 42:11
Sometimes my dice try to kill me.
Andrew 42:13
Just battering molasses.
Brian 42:14
Well that's not, that's not what's going to try and kill you. But this will. It is going to...
Landree 42:21
Oh shit.
Sarah 42:22
Should I start rolling a new character?
Ned 42:23
Protection. Disadvantage, please.
Brian 42:25
You have it. So it kind of looks at you angrily for a moment and brings back one massive claw and tries to attack you. It has an 18 with disadvantage. Yes?
Sarah 42:40
It hits.
Brian 42:40
It hits you.
Ned 42:41
I tried.
Brian 42:43
You take... I don't have enough dice.
Eddie 42:47
Oh...
Landree 42:50
Oh no.
Ned 42:50
Fuck that sentence.
Sarah 42:51
I don't like this game anymore.
Landree 42:51
No...
Ned 42:56
That's the worst sentence I've ever heard from a fucking Dungeon Master.
Landree 43:02
Truly.
Brian 43:04
You take 26--
Ned 43:06
Ah god.
Sarah 43:09
I'm down.
Ned 43:10
Who's holding that stabilization scroll?
Brian 43:11
You have a party member who's down.
Ned 43:13
Oh you're holding the scroll?
Brian 43:14
It's on her. As are the potions.
Ned 43:16
Someone grab that scroll.
Landree 43:17
What's on you?
Ned 43:18
She's-- oh we forgot to tell you, there are two health potions and a stabilization scroll in her pockets.
Brian 43:21
Lennox, it is now your turn.
Eddie 43:24
Uh...
Sarah 43:29
I will understand if you guys just run.
Brian 43:31
You have all the healing things on you.
Sarah 43:34
Steal my stuff and run.
Brian 43:35
This thing just dropped your teammate in a swipe.
Eddie 43:38
Do we stand and fight?
Ned 43:39
I mean we got to get her.
Sarah 43:40
In theory.
Eddie 43:41
Have fun with that.
Brian 43:45
You can pick her up you just move half speed and then half of that as you go up the ladder.
Eddie 43:49
Yeah, and get an opportunity as I'm trying to walk away from the thing.
Brian 43:52
No, because you're not within its reach you can pull her from where you are.
Eddie 43:57
Oh can I?
Brian 43:58
Yeah.
Eddie 43:58
I do that.
Brian 43:59
You can be, so you can be 10 feet away from it and pick her up and pull her. You can interact with an adjacent space.
Eddie 44:06
So I grab her.
Brian 44:07
Okay.
Eddie 44:07
Fling her over my shoulder and start up the ladder.
Brian 44:11
Great.
Eddie 44:11
If I can do all that of my turn.
Ned 44:13
I don't think you can make it that far, can you?
That gets you to the ladder.
Andrew 44:14
15 feet? You're at the base of the ladder.
Eddie 44:17
I'm going to allow him to answer that question.
Brian 44:18
It will make an attack of opportunity on her body.
Eddie 44:22
Ooh...
Ned 44:23
Protection.
Brian 44:24
No, you only have one reaction a round.
Ned 44:29
That's true.
Brian 44:30
It rolls a 20.
Eddie 44:33
I pull back a leg.
Brian 44:35
What are your, what is your max hit point total?
Sarah 44:38
18.
Brian 44:39
18 is your max hit point total?
Sarah 44:40
Yes.
Brian 44:40
Okay, you're currently at zero?
Sarah 44:42
Yeah.
Brian 44:46
Okay, I'm not going to lie, I'm going to be 100% honest with what I roll. 16.
Sarah 44:52
Okay, so you what this will do is it will automatically remove one of your credit fail saves your death saving throws Okay, so you have one automatic failure okay and the rule of death is if you ever take damage that is equal to your max total at once when you're at zero if you if you're ever dropped in one attack below zero to your max total it's an instant death right? So you narrowly avoided death because I rolled two ones Yeah, so fortunate slightly on your side you have one failed a test yes throw Okay, Linux has now picture up and you can now move read half speed up the ladder so you have to be next to her so you are 15 feet from the ladders get you to make it to go to the ladder you have her and you are now to the letter A and can I cast spare the dying on her? Is it a bonus know it's a full action nevermind okay keep in mind you guys can acquire items that are on people's or someone can use the thing that she can't be stopped. She can't stop you from doing Xenia Europe.
Brian 44:54
So you what this will do is it will automatically remove one of your crit fail saves, your death saving throws.
Sarah 45:00
Okay.
Brian 45:01
So you have one automatic failure.
Sarah 45:02
Okay.
Brian 45:03
And the rule with death is if you ever take damage that is equal to your max total at once when you're at zero, if you, if you're ever dropped in one attack below zero to your max total it's an instant death.
Sarah 45:15
Right.
Brian 45:15
So you narrowly avoided death because I rolled two ones.
Sarah 45:18
Yeah.
Brian 45:19
So fortune is slightly on your side. You have one failed death throw.
Sarah 45:23
Okay.
Brian 45:24
Lennox has now picked her up and you can now move, but you're at half speed.
Eddie 45:29
Up the ladder.
Brian 45:30
So you have to be next to her, so you are 15 feet from the ladder so you can make it to the ladder.
You have her and you are now to the ladder.
Eddie 45:38
So go to the ladder.
Can I cast Spare the Dying on her?
Brian 45:44
Is it a bonus?
Eddie 45:45
No, it's a full action, nevermind.
Brian 45:46
Okay. Keep in mind you guys can acquire items that are on people's persons.
Ned 45:50
Someone can use the thing that she, she's holding.
Brian 45:51
She can't stopped, she can't stop you from doing it. Zenia, you're up.
Landree 45:55
You guys have, we, just now you told me about these healing potions. But do I, does Zenia know about these potions?
Eddie 46:02
No.
Landree 46:03
Okay.
Brian 46:04
You can yell.
Ned 46:05
""Someone grab the stabilization potion that's in her pocket!""
Brian 46:07
You can yell up to one sentence as long as it takes you no more than six sen--
Eddie 46:12
My next turn I can stabilize her.
Brian 46:14
Every round, your actions within a round, is six seconds. So you can announce anything for free as long as it is within one sentence.
Landree 46:23
I totally understand that. I just don't think she would magically come up with the, just like randomly be like, 'oh does somebody have a potion?' right away. Do you know what I mean?
Brian 46:30
For sure.
Landree 46:31
Okay, so he, Lennox is at the ladder. I believe I am too. Can I start climbing?
Brian 46:37
Yes.
Landree 46:37
Great. I'm going to climb up the ladder. How many feet is it?
Brian 46:41
15 feet.
Landree 46:41
Fantastic. So I climb up the ladder.
Brian 46:43
You climb up the ladder. That is your movement.
Landree 46:45
Yeah. And I'd like to cast... let's start with Chill Touch.
Brian 46:50
Okay.
Ned 46:51
Chill Touch is on boss this round.
Landree 46:52
Uh, well he's big so fingers crossed.
Brian 46:56
You no longer have disadvantage by the way.
Landree 46:58
Great. 14.
Brian 46:59
A 14 will not hit though.
Landree 47:01
Damn it.
Brian 47:01
It is a huge creature.
Landree 47:02
Wait, oh yeah. 14. And it won't hit?
Brian 47:08
No. He's bigger than big, he's huge.
Landree 47:09
Should be easy to hit.
Brian 47:09
Brevin. You're up.
Ned 47:10
I'm not moving into range of that for an attack of opportunity. I'm going to keep at the front of the group for the sake of Protection when it moves but I'm going to fire a crossbow bolt at it.
Brian 47:19
Okay, please do.
Ned 47:21
How does an 18 do?
Brian 47:23
An 18 will hit it.
Ned 47:24
That's 7 damage.
Brian 47:25
Okay, 7 damage. Top of the order, Lorzatch.
Ned 47:28
I'm not moving until everyone else has started to.
Brian 47:30
Okay. Top of the order. You still have this massive black ichor salamander that's trying to terrorize you guys, barely able to even fit in the room that you guys are. Power to drop one of your party members with a single strike. Lorzatch, what do you do?
Andrew 47:44
Lorzatch moves towards the back ladder and climbs as quickly as he can, which would put him probably...
Brian 47:51
Halfway up the ladder.
Andrew 47:52
Halfway up at the end of his movement.
Brian 47:54
You are halfway up the ladder. Fikarra. Would you please make a death saving throw?
You now have...
Sarah 48:03
I rolled a three.
Brian 48:04
Two fails. On a third fail, you will die.
Sarah 48:07
Thank you, Brian.
Brian 48:08
Unless somebody does something to help you.
Sarah 48:10
Thank you.
Brian 48:11
It is now the organism's turn.
Eddie 48:13
Not the organism.
Brian 48:15
Ned.
Ned 48:15
Yeah.
Brian 48:16
You are being attacked.
Ned 48:17
Yeah, I figured.
Brian 48:19
It is going to move to you.
Ned 48:20
Okay. Someone move the big massive scary thing into my face.
Brian 48:25
And it is just going to straight-up try and bite you. It is going to roll a 30.
Ned 48:32
Yeah, I mean, that'll hit. That'll hit.
Brian 48:37
A 30.
Landree 48:38
I mean, not for me.
Ned 48:39
Generally speaking, uh, fuck. How we living? I'll be good. I'll be up.
I mean, you are.
Sarah 48:46
I'm not.
Barely.
Ned 48:49
We're working on it.
Landree 48:50
Hanging on.
Brian 48:51
You take 26 piercing damage.
Ned 48:54
I am down.
Brian 48:56
In addition to 7 acid splash damage.
Ned 48:59
No, I mean I was down at the first part.
Brian 49:02
Yes, but if you...
Ned 49:03
Nowhere near.
Brian 49:04
Total, you're... okay. You're at zero.
Ned 49:07
I am at zero.
Brian 49:08
Okay. Lennox.
Eddie 49:10
I cast Spare the Dying on Fikarra and climb up the ladder.
Brian 49:16
Okay.
Eddie 49:16
You no longer have to roll saving throws for death, you are stabilized.
Sarah 49:21
Okay, I'm just zero.
Ned 49:22
Yes, you are, you are at zero hit points.
Brian 49:25
Zero and unconscious.
Andrew 49:26
Can I ask, do you have Spare the Dying as one of your own spells or as a result of the scroll that she has on her purse?
Eddie 49:33
It's a cantrip. I have it as well.
Ned 49:35
The scroll is still in play.
Eddie 49:37
The scroll is still in play.
Brian 49:37
So you now make it up the ladder.
Ned 49:40
The whole way or halfway? Because he's carrying her, right?
Brian 49:42
Yes, I need a Strength check.
Ned 49:46
Cool.
Brian 49:47
That's what you need.
Eddie 49:48
A 20.
Brian 49:48
A straight-up 20? Yeah, you manage to get her up there and I will say with enough to kind of move your speed without hindrance. So you can be at the top of that ladder. So everybody seems above the platform except for your one companion who was dropped directly in front of that monster.
Ned 50:03
'Sup y'all? How you living?
Brian 50:05
Better than you.
Ned 50:07
Barely?
Landree 50:08
Okay, um, okay.
Ned 50:11
You got a stun thing?
Landree 50:14
I cast Chaos Bolt.
Ned 50:16
This would be a really bad time for Wild Magic come into play. Sorry, my thoughts are out loud.
Landree 50:20
I know but it's just so powerful.
Sarah 50:22
I think it'd be a great idea.
Brian 50:23
It is quite some powerful, but this is a massive creature. Please roll.
Ned 50:28
Oh no.
Brian 50:29
That's a 2. Would you please roll that d20 one more time. It's a bit of a chaotic situation.
Landree 50:38
I made a choice.
Brian 50:45
You are still seemingly, unbelievably in control.
But you are not very much help to anyone right now. Brevin, would you please make a death saving throw?
Ned 50:57
Yeah for fucking sure.
Brian 50:58
You're going to nat 20 this right now and I'm going to hate you forever.
Ned 51:01
I'm rolling the fuck-or-yeah die. It's 14.
Brian 51:05
Okay, you have one save.
Ned 51:07
I have one successful save.
Brian 51:08
Okay.
Sarah 51:09
You would have rolled a nat 20, I would have jumped over this table.
Ned 51:12
We're sitting next to each other.
Sarah 51:13
I would have still...
Landree 51:14
'I would have jumped over the table and then walked around, back to my seat...'
Sarah 51:19
So I could jump over the table again. And then there would be some serious finger-wagging and scowling.
Brian 51:27
Top of the order, Lorzatch.
Ned 51:31
Hey man. Don't shake your head sadly at my death.
Andrew 51:36
Lorzatch does not have a spell or the strength to extract Brevin without endangering himself and others and he is going to move towards the door that leads out of this room and see if there is anything that they might use to flush this chamber out. So, the other halfway up the ladder, and then the remainder of his movement to make it to the door which is...
About 20 feet so he'd be at the door, maybe.
Brian 52:05
Twenty...
He'd be at the door, able to check the door. The door can be forced open manually.
Andrew 52:12
Which he does, check the door.
Brian 52:14
Give me as Strength, he does check the door. Yeah, you can still make a Strength check to see if he can force it open.
A 6 is not going to be quite enough. You might need a little help. Okay. Fikarra is unconscious.
Andrew 52:20
It's a 6.
Sarah 52:26
Yeah.
Ned 52:26
She's stable but she unconscious.
Brian 52:28
It's the creature's turn. So having struck Brevin down with a single blow, it doesn't even bother with him anymore and just crawls over his body. Now the frightening thing about this creature is even though it is huge and this chamber is far too small for it, you discover to a certain extent that it's amorphous and that it can change and shift its body to squeeze through sections it's far too large for. And it's huge, so it's very easily able to crawl up that 15-foot landing that you guys are trying to escape from, so right now it's like a dog sort of paws-up on that landing with its claws able to reach you from off the back side.
Landree 53:07
What the fuck?
Eddie 53:07
Lennox goes and kicks the door open.
Brian 53:07
Lennox.
Give me Strength check, please. You are still carrying the unconscious Fikarra.
Eddie 53:13
I'm trying to decide if I am still carrying...
Brian 53:15
Oh...
Ned 53:19
Man, when the chips are down, your fucking true colors show, bitches.
Eddie 53:24
Yes, he's still carrying Fikarra. And he fumbles.
Brian 53:28
And he fumbles.
Ned 53:30
Fikarra or the door?
Eddie 53:31
The door, oh, I don't know, was it a Strength check for--
Brian 53:33
I don't know either, what did you roll for? If you're, if you're going to you, made a debate as to whether or not you are going to drop her.
Eddie 53:40
Yeah, no, I'm not going to drop her.
Brian 53:41
You don't have to roll to see whether or not you maintain her, you can just dump her.
Eddie 53:44
No, no.
Brian 53:45
So that roll was to see if you could force, force open the door?
Eddie 53:47
Yes.
Brian 53:47
You have not been able to force open the door. Zenia.
Eddie 53:51
Oh oh oh, wait.
Brian 53:52
You are now-- yes please, backtrack.
Eddie 53:53
Was that an action? Like, what, can I still do... Can I still?
Brian 53:57
You can still perform an action.
Eddie 53:58
Can I see the monster?
Brian 53:59
Oh, you can see its face.
Eddie 54:01
I shoot it with my power. I do not believe my power is strong enough.
Brian 54:10
Not enough. We're back. Zenia. How quickly that turn spins right around. You are, this thing is in your face. It sees you, it smells you, and it does not like you.
Ned 54:22
Does it have a thing? Don't you have one of those things where when you touch, you do horrible damage?I just made that up, but I hoped...
Landree 54:27
I'm, well, wait, until, if I move it all, is, does that provoke an attack of opportunity?
Brian 54:33
At this exact moment it cannot reach you because the only thing it can attack you with is its face or its hands, both of which are kind of occupied.
Landree 54:40
Okay, cool. So I am going to move away.
Brian 54:44
Everyone is kind of trapped at this door they can't open.
Landree 54:46
Sure and I'm gonna cast Chill Touch.
Brian 54:49
Chill Touch.
Landree 54:51
That's my fallback. Okay. 23.
Brian 54:55
Great. Would you also please roll a d20? It's a very tenuous situation.
Landree 55:00
12.
Brian 55:01
You're fine. Roll damage for your spell.
Landree 55:03
A 5.
Of necrotic damage.
Brian 55:04
5 necrotic damage. Thank you so very very much. Brevin, would you please make another save throw?
5 damage.
Ned 55:10
Yeah for sure.
Landree 55:12
I love your positive attitude.
Ned 55:13
Yeah, well it's okay.
Brian 55:15
You have one fail and one success.
Ned 55:17
Yeah, I know.
Brian 55:18
Top of the order, Lorzatch. What are you doing?
Andrew 55:20
Lorzatch is going to open the door out of the room.
Brian 55:22
Open the door out of the room. You are now into an antechamber. A quick look to your left is a staircase. A quick look to your right seems to be some sort of lit console.
Andrew 55:33
Lorzatch is going to move to his right and examine the console.
Brian 55:37
Okay, give me an Investigation check.
That is a natural 20.
Great. So here's what you see. You have this half-moon console in front of you and everything is written in Elvish, which luckily for you, you can decipher even though it's sort of a technical medical lingo and what you can surmise here is that this is some sort of command nodule that controls the general area of the zonot that you are in, or at least is one that can do that. And as you're sort of reading the maps that are displayed on here and there are red flashing lights warning about the lockdown, you notice that where you guys came down in the elevator and the, the rooms that you are in and more importantly, that tank that you guys are escaping from is all considered one section of the zonot. And while this console does not give you complete control over the building as a whole, it does allow you certain permissions within this area. And you notice that you are at the very bottom of Zonot 4 which means below you is nothing but an indecipherable depth of water. But it does look like this area can be purged.
Landree 55:45
Yes.
Ned 56:51
Let's just remember I'm on the floor.
Andrew 56:53
But the room that we are currently in.
Brian 56:55
The room that you are in and the tank where this bio-mutation originated--
Andrew 57:00
Is all one area.
Brian 57:00
It's all one area. You are at the very bottom of the zonot.
Andrew 57:06
Lorzatch is going to direct the people behind him to examine the staircase to the left.
Brian 57:13
Okay.
Andrew 57:14
And I believe that is his entire turn.
Brian 57:16
Okay. Fikarra, you're still unconscious. The beast has now finished its movement to get on top of the platform. Lennox.
Eddie 57:26
Lennox goes through the door.
Brian 57:28
As you see through, you see exactly what Lorzatch was talking to you about. To the left is a staircase that looks like it leads out of this area.
Eddie 57:35
I carry her up the stairs.
Brian 57:36
Okay, you may now exit the map. Zenia.
Landree 57:39
Okay. Um, I'd like to go up the ladder if I can.
Brian 57:43
Okay you can staircase, you make it halfway up. Brevin. Left behind. Still at the bottom of this tank.
Ned 57:50
Still going to make my damn saving throw.
Brian 57:51
Could you please make a saving throw?
Ned 57:53
Yeah, for sure, I'ma wake up and kill this fucker. 11.
Brian 57:57
You have two saves.
Ned 57:59
Two saves, one fail.
Brian 58:01
Excellent. Top of the order, Lorzatch. You now see what can be done.
Andrew 58:08
Lorzatch is going to insist that Zenia leave the area, and then he's going to activate the control that purges this chamber.
Brian 58:17
Would you like to use your movement to leave?
Andrew 58:19
Absolutely.
Brian 58:22
As Zenia rushes up the stairwell, you take but a moment to steady your hand. The decision must be made and you know that Lorzatch is the only one among you stalwart enough to do so. The orb must be recovered. And as you punch the console, you'll have just enough time to race up the stairs to the next floor. A mucous membrane seals off the stairwell and a few bright pops of light detonate around the walls below you. You all crowd around this film, staring down as the bottom two floors of the zonot break off from the cavern wall and plunge into the depths below, taking the unconscious Brevin to his grave.
Now, you are three, with the unconscious Fikarra and the dangerous orb, trapped at the bottom of Zonot 4.
Next week on Encounter Party! Doom in the dark as the remaining party members fight for survival at the bottom of Zonot 4. What has happened to all the Simic doctors? Can anyone save them from sharing Brevin's fate? A mysterious merman, the betrayal of Elasia, all this and more next time on Encounter Party!

Brian 0:01
This week on Encounter Party: catastrophe on the horizon as our players rush to uncover the dastardly plot of Malphus Reed. While transporting the unconscious Elasia, our players once again run afoul of Mr. Alfonso's men. However, something had transformed the goons into monstrous creatures! Bunkered down in a broken train, our players plan their next move, this week, on Encounter Party!
After a grueling battle, we rejoin the four of you hiding inside of a ruined rail car. You can hear the screams of Ravnican citizens that are being torn from their homes. The train might be used as a means of escape if you could figure out how to operate it or if it was wasn't pointing in the wrong direction.
Sarah 1:01
Well, since it's a train engine, we can make it go backwards, right? In theory? If we're in Ravnica, not real world.
Ned 1:09
Do you know how to drive a train? Is that, like, a skill for anyone?
Eddie 1:13
It can't be that hard, let's try and figure it out!
Brian 1:15
Oh please, let's. So it's clear to everyone that this engine is made out of a metal called mizzium. Now mizzium was discovered by the leader of the Izzet League, who is the dragon known as the Firemind. The Firemind's real name is Niv-Mizzet and so he names everything after himself. So, the Izzet league, mizzium as the metal. Now mizzium is an amorphous metal, which means that by applying certain stimuli or implementing certain aspects to it, you can convince it to change shape without having to smelt it.
Eddie 1:45
T-1000.
Brian 1:48
Yeah, but sort of T-1000 in the form of silly putty.
Eddie 1:52
Yes!
Brian 1:52
But it is metal, and the Izzet are the only ones who really know how to manipulate it. So as you look at what you're as assuming is some sort of control module for this engine, it's not really laid out in a manner that would be accessible. There are nubs that could be levers, there are wheels that might actually just be plates, like, it's all strangely, there are no...
Ned 2:19
'Wheels that could be plates' is such a good description!
Brian 2:26
There are, there are gears that look like they turn but they're actually connected, like it is all incredibly confusing to you and it would be great if your Izzet companion was not shipped away.
Ned 2:38
To what we think is the destination of this train, right? Do we know this? Do we know where she went? I assumed that she got sent along on another mission.
Brian 2:45
Lavinia told you that she was detained.
Ned 2:48
Detained. Are we able to, would the train cars feel secure enough that we could rest within them to get some stuff back and also prep for next day, since it's nighttime?
Brian 2:58
I mean, the doors are open.
Ned 3:00
But are they closeable?
Eddie 3:01
Do you think like we can prop them closed? Are there locks on them, from inside?
Sarah 3:05
Or we could post watches?
Ned 3:07
True.
Brian 3:08
You can also post watches. I imagine that you could secure yourself in one of these, it is clear that these cars are designed for people to exit in and out from various different entrances. There's two at the front, two at the back of each car. But I think with the, none of the doors are blown off of them. The doors extend outward so they were kind of ripped open when these things came out. But nothing is, is destroyed structurally on the interior. So if you did want to, there's also turned over showcases and bookcases and a lot of material inside that could be stacked and barricaded.
Eddie 3:49
So yeah, I think we should try and fortify the entrances.
Ned 3:52
Give ourselves the ability for a long rest.
Eddie 3:53
The best that we can and get ready for a long rest. I think we should still take watch.
Ned 3:58
Yeah.
Sarah 3:58
I can lift things!
Eddie 3:59
Have turns taking watch.
Brian 4:00
Yes.
Sarah 4:01
I can.
Brian 4:02
Yes you can.
Ned 4:03
What's-his-butt doesn't sleep.
Brian 4:04
So I would say that it takes you guys no discernible time at all to do this because of you.
Sarah 4:11
I can lift things.
Brian 4:12
Because of the, because of the minotauran assistance. So you guys manage to barricade yourselves safely. Again, there are no windows on these cars. So you just have to manage yourself to the entrances however you wish to do. Who's going to take first watch?
Andrew 4:26
That'd be Lorzatch.
Brian 4:28
Okay.
Ned 4:28
I'll replace.
Brian 4:29
Who's going to, give me a, give me a watch order please.
Ned 4:31
Watch 2.
Brian 4:32
Okay, so Brevin number two.
Sarah 4:34
I'll go watch 3.
Okay, Fikarra number three. Last watch. Great. Andrew, could you please roll me a d20?
Andrew 4:40
13.
Brian 4:41
Okay, who's second?
Ned 4:43
Me.
Brian 4:43
Would you please roll me at d20? A 5? Okay, thank you very much. Who's third?
Sarah 4:48
I am. 16.
Brian 4:51
Okay, and last.
Eddie 4:53
15.
Brian 4:54
Great. Ned, you're dead.
You die in the night.
Ned 5:00
You wake up and you are now a marionette.
Brian 5:05
Dawn arrives after a long rest as you four sit huddled inside the ransacked train car. Sleep was not so peaceful amidst the broken glass and shattered display cases. Even though the danger has passed, you swear you can still hear the screams of horror echoing in your ears. The only way is forward, however your train is currently pointed backwards. It is now morning. You are in a part of the city you are unfamiliar with. You are still on the rail line but you do have an engine you can't run.
Ned 5:37
Can't run the engine and we have a passed-out, wrapped-up Elasia. Right?
Brian 5:42
Yes, Elasia.
Ned 5:43
Elasia. And we have no more Boros guards helping.
Brian 5:46
And you have no more Boros sentry.
Ned 5:48
So two of us have to carry Elasia for a walk.
Brian 5:50
Correct.
Ned 5:50
Yeah.
Eddie 5:51
I come help.
Sarah 5:52
I was going to say, like, can I carry her by myself?
Brian 5:54
Yeah.
Sarah 5:55
Okay. I mean, just like--
Ned 5:56
I mean, this is the question.
Eddie 5:57
Throw her over your shoulder?
Ned 5:57
We need to continue onwards to get to the Simic.
Brian 6:00
She is in some sort of induced stasis.
Ned 6:03
Like she's not waking up.
Brian 6:04
Coma-esque. She is being preserved until you guys reach the compound to give her the medical attention she needs.
Ned 6:11
Do we have any idea how far away from the compound we are?
Brian 6:12
You were intended to make it late into the night the night before.
Ned 6:17
And we got ambushed in the evening right before night.
Eddie 6:20
So we're close then.
Ned 6:22
Great, well, I think we carry and go to the Simic compound.
Brian 6:25
Okay. You trudge along the rail line for, we'll say about another hour or so, but it doesn't take long before this massive wall comes into view that bisects the city. Hanging from the wall are the serene blue and green banners of the Simic Combine. Now the Simic is a guild that specializes in medicine and water treatment for the city of Ravnica. They are notorious biologists in sort of a Frankenstein-type sense and you can often see their creations roaming the, the streets and skies of Ravnica. The rail line itself ends abruptly a short distance from the wall. The area is littered with stacked timber and I-beams and other sort of building supplies that suggests that construction is not ended, it's just stalled. Yes?
Andrew 7:18
At any point in the distance we've covered, would we have noticed a feature in the tracks to allow a turn or a repositioning of the tracks?
Brian 7:29
No, it is a straight line.
Andrew 7:30
It is a straight line.
Brian 7:32
Correct.
Ned 7:33
No switches, no turns.
Brian 7:34
A line you have now reached the end of. And it does not enter into the compound. So there is a towering gate in front of a gorgeous motif of shell spirals and driftwood, this sort of beautiful curvature. Astride the gate are two reliefs of merfolk, each that are pouring water out of jugs. They are actually fountains and they're pouring thin streams of water down into two foot pools on either side of the gate. So there's a lot of merfolk motifs. The, the Simic Combine is mostly made up of merfolk. In Ravnica they're a little bit different, so they, they have legs in Ravnica. The merfolk in Ravnica are more like fish people rather than what you think of as like mermaids, but the Simic are very aquatic-based guild. The walls themselves are covered in algae and lichens that are feeding off of the damp air. It's all a very Neptunian experience as you approach and behind the wall you can definitely hear the drowning roar of a very, very large waterfall.
Andrew 7:34
Are there any sentries posted?
Brian 8:44
There are none on the outside of the gate.
Ned 8:48
So there's no one that greets us in any way.
Brian 8:50
Not, not in front of the gate.
Ned 8:52
So then I think we knock on the door, we're here to see this Combine. We knock on the gate.
Brian 8:56
You knock on the gate and on the door, the design were there looks to be like a pearl is actually a portal and it opens up and this big fish eye just sort of leers out at you guys, waiting for you to initiate.
Ned 9:09
Hey, Lennox, as the Azorius, you want to take this one?
Eddie 9:11
I will show him my credentials.
Brian 9:14
Ah yes.
Eddie 9:16
""We are here to seek medical help for this woman. We have been sent.""
Brian 9:20
""And what is wrong with her?"" You can hear the distinct sort of gurgle resonating below the vocal cords of this man.
Sarah 9:29
""We're not entirely sure, sir. But we unfortunately need to find a way to wake her, for she might have information that we need.""
Brian 9:37
""Where did you come from?""
Sarah 9:39
""34th District, sir.""
Brian 9:41
""Of the Boros Legion?""
Ned 9:42
And we were sent by Lavinia. This is a Azorius, Azorius member who might have information they need but unfortunately she has been taken badly and they have her in an induced state until we could get here to get her some help.
Brian 9:56
He very rudely stops paying attention to you about halfway through that explanation and focuses directly and only at Lennox in this very 'you're going to flash a badge of authority, but do you come to a Simic stronghold.'
Eddie 10:11
""Sir, Lavinia has sent us here to get medical attention for this woman.""
Brian 10:15
""And Lavinia is who?""
Eddie 10:17
""She is the boss."" Of the Azorius.
Ned 10:22
Maze Runner.
Eddie 10:24
She's our Maze Runner.
Brian 10:26
""Oh."" Now the maze runners are essentially celebrities at this point. Everybody paid attention to this, they know who this is. So the Azorius Maze Runner.
Sarah 10:36
""We're not here on behalf of any specific guild. A Miss Lavinia is convinced that the woman who is currently comatose has information that could be detrimental to all of Ravnica if not discovered.""
Brian 10:48
""And how did you get here?""
Eddie 10:50
""We traveled here along the rails. We were set upon on the way here.""
Ned 10:54
Seven of our comrades are down.
Eddie 10:55
""We survived but several of our comrades...""
Brian 10:57
""I was going to ask why you didn't have a Legion escort.""
Sarah 11:00
""We did have one.""
Eddie 11:02
""They were all killed unfortunately.""
Ned 11:04
Or taken.
Brian 11:04
""What do I need to be worried about before I consider letting you in here?""
Eddie 11:08
""Absolutely nothing, sir.""
Sarah 11:10
I assume I'm still like covered in blood. Maybe? No?
Brian 11:14
Yes, you were. Well, it depends on if you cleaned yourself up, but in the middle of that rail car, maybe not an option.
Sarah 11:20
Right. ""Can you, oh dear, I'm not, oh, god. Am I contagious?""
Ned 11:27
I mean, there are--
Sarah 11:28
""Am I contagious?""
Ned 11:29
""We were beset upon--""
Andrew 11:30
""No.""
Ned 11:30
""By creatures we had met previously who were now seemingly controlled by a force we don't understand. To say that we aren't necessarily being followed by something dangerous would be a lie.""
Andrew 11:41
""Sudden dental and ossific hypertrophy accompanied by a discoloration of the skin.""
Brian 11:47
Andrew, this fishman looks at you with absolute hatred and out of nowhere just says, ""You have a great deal of gall coming to us like this, under-citizen.""
Sarah 11:59
""Sir, we mean no respect.""
Brian 12:02
""I am not talking to you, legionnaire.""
Sarah 12:03
""Yes sir.""
Brian 12:04
""I'm talking to the one whose people continue to assault us on nearly a nightly basis.""
Eddie 12:09
""Might I say that he has proven, proven himself an ally to our cause.""
Brian 12:14
""Is he in your custody or is he on his own guild's accord?""
Eddie 12:18
""Right now, he is under my custody.""
Brian 12:21
""What am I not being told here? You march up to our gate with someone I do not know, warning us of an enemy I do not know, flashing a badge that has no authority here. This is not Simic business. Why are you wasting our time?""
Sarah 12:37
""Sir, I don't think his badge of authority was necessarily meant to be meaning of authority over you. I think it was more of an identification for him. And possibly habit.""
Eddie 12:48
""I'm a man of the law.""
Brian 12:50
Yes.
Eddie 12:51
""All we seek is help reviving this woman.""
Brian 12:54
""And what happened to your Legion escort?""
Ned 12:59
""I'm, I'm sorry. Was I not talking? They were beset upon by an enemy I have now warned you by and either killed or taken away.""
Eddie 13:04
""We found a train car several miles back. But something happened to it. Everyone on the train car was somehow transformed into ravenous beasts. They attacked us, killed our Legion--""
Brian 13:19
""And this train looked... how?""
Ned 13:22
Not good.
Brian 13:24
""Mizzium engine, writing on the side?""
Sarah 13:26
""Correct.""
Ned 13:26
""Yeah.""
Brian 13:27
""Wait here,"" and the portal just slams shut. And he just disappears. And it's like a solid 10 minutes of you guys sitting around waiting; whether or not you've just been abandoned outside this gate, if anybody's coming back. But eventually you do hear a bit of a commotion from behind the gate. There are some mechanisms and some large pieces shifting from inside the gate. And then with a heavy groan, this massive portal into Zonot #4 just groans open and, and the minute that the doors kind of separate you, this, the sound of this massive waterfall just rushes out to meet you guys. And there are a pair of merfolk sentries who come rushing forward on these weird grotesque biology experiments. And they are mostly crabs. They're like these very, very large crabs, but they have shark heads and they're being ridden, they're kind of snapping at you. [clacking noise]
Eddie 13:27
""Correct.""
Brian 14:25
And if their claws aren't keeping you at bay, the, the merfolk that are riding them have these really, really long coral spears and you guys are kind of herded inside the zonot. And one of the things you notice quite immediately as everything opens up in front of you is this isn't just a singular facility. It's not just the zonot alone. There's actually a sizable chunk of Ravnica that's walled off and within Simic guild control. There, there are neighborhoods, there are large factory complexes, this is, this is like a sizable guild territory. And you are shoved down this, this sort of entry promenade on your way to the zonot as the crab-sharks are sort of poking and prodding you guys down the lane and you look to your right and you see the large fish-eyed merman who greeted you at the gate is currently embroiled with another Ravnican citizen who seems to be taking all of his attention. This Ravnican is an older male, probably mid-60s, very frail of frame and face, but he's very sharply dressed in sort of a casual way. Very nice slacks and shoes. He has a nice vest, a pocket watch. He himself is wearing a nice pair of glasses. He has white hair, like gray hair, and a rather illustrious mustache that, that sweeps around his face and then back up to his ears. But he as, as sort of frail and clean and pristine as he is, he seems about as flabbergasted is a man of his stature could possibly be and he's all but shouting at the merman, just this, ""My engine? Oh, good heavens, what has happened to my engine? What is everything going on? Why is no one talking to me?"" And you can hear that sort of nonsensical rambling as you guys are herded back down the pathway. Let me provide you with a map.
Ned 16:13
Yay! Map!
Sarah 16:14
I love maps.
Brian 16:15
So you guys will enter here on the south end where you see that the Boros line has ended. And this is the gate where you just came in. And so you guys are down here. And the major feature here is obviously this massive hole in the middle of Ravnica, this is a sinkhole, and you can hear and now see this massive waterfall, which is actually an underground river that has broken over the sinkhole and is now pouring down into that hole. Down there is where the zonot will be. So a Simic zonot is basically an upside-down skyscraper that is going down into the water. So a large portion of it is underwater. And because it is marine, it is organic, so it sort of grows down into the water rather than is constructed. But that's not the only thing that you see here. As you look to the northeast sort of above the waterfall you can see a neighborhood, there's residential buildings there, perhaps a few shops, clearly where people within the compound can reside and make this a permanent place of residence. On top of the waterfall you can see structures and engineering mechanisms that suggests that the Izzet have in fact built a hydroelectric power plant here and then a little ways down you can see a pump station and then on the far end of the compound again that's probably a good mile and a half outside your view is this massive towering structure and even though it is a little bit of, little bit away you can very clearly see the banners and sigils of the Izzet League proudly displayed.
Ned 17:55
Didn't Captain Farland tell us or tell me that the power plant was leased by the Izzet?
Brian 18:01
Yes.
Ned 18:02
Great. So it's an Izzet power plant that is being leased into the Simic area?
Brian 18:07
The reverse. The Simic are--
Ned 18:10
Leasing land to the Izzet.
Brian 18:12
Yes.
Ned 18:12
Yeah. Okay. Great.
Brian 18:13
Yes, the waterway systems are controlled by the Simic.
Ned 18:15
Copy. Thank you.
Brian 18:17
Because inside a well of water is uninhabitable to anybody but them and so they have claimed it.
Ned 18:21
Right.
Brian 18:21
So the four of you are led through this compound with Elasia in tow and it's still the early morning hours. So there is a great deal of hustle and bustle as everybody's getting started for their day. There are Simic guild members everywhere. And you can, you notice that there are some racial distinctions within the Simic guild. You see pretty exclusively that there are obviously a lot of merfolk, vedalken, and elves. But, Andrew, these are not Devkarin elves, okay, these are not undercity-dwelling elves. These are some other distinction. And then there's a fourth group that looks really strange because they look like they used to be elvish or they used to be vedalken. But they have like weird growths on them, or some of them have gills, or some of them have like extra arms. Some of their arms are like crab arms. And you're starting to notice that the rumors are true that the Simic do actually experiment on living biological creatures in an effort to sort of artificially evolve them. And your led along this sinkhole, which you're now noticing is a good mile in diameter. And as you look down, you can see the zonot growing downward into the water, like big, gigantic pieces of kelp. And you're shuffled inside the zonot. And again, this is a Simic facility. So it's all very marine in design. And there are no straight lines anywhere, every room, every facility, every compartment looks almost like a bubbling, like a boiling bubble was frozen right before it was about to pop. And there seems to be tanks of liquid everywhere. But it is a medical facility. So everything is very clean. Everything is full of protocol. There's a great deal of pomp and circumstance as, as you guys are kind of led through the lobby down into a particular area of the zonot and you're coerced, if not shoved into this side waiting room. And as the door opens, which is sort of more like a, like a wet iris, it just sort of slips open. And you can see in this rather comfortable, very hospitable waiting room is your vedalken companion Zenia of the Izzet League just sitting there hanging out. And behind her through the window, you notice that you are already underwater.
AD BREAK
Ned 21:09
Well, hello.
Landree 21:11
""Oh, hello.""
Ned 21:11
Where have you been?
Landree 21:14
""Just been hanging out.""
Ned 21:15
Here?
Landree 21:16
""Yeah, where have you all been?""
Ned 21:18
Nearly dying.
Landree 21:19
""Why are you so bloody?""
Sarah 21:20
""I killed something. With my mace.""
Brian 21:24
As you guys kind of get shuffled in, you see a medical professional who comes in behind you and says, ""I've been told that someone here needs medical attention. Is this correct?""
Sarah 21:33
""Please, yes, sir.""
Brian 21:34
""And what is wrong with this woman?""
Sarah 21:36
""We're not entirely sure.""
Brian 21:38
""I see.""
Landree 21:39
""She does have horns, though. But I think that they're, you know, particular to her breed of...""
Ned 21:45
Oh, hey, not, not her.
Brian 21:46
""I think we're referencing the woman who is unconscious in her arms.""
Landree 21:50
""Oh, I see.""
Andrew 21:51
""Afflicted by something that's rendered her unconscious and uncommunicative.""
Eddie 21:56
""She seems to be in a deep state of shock.""
Brian 21:59
For whatever really offensive reason, you are getting straight up ghosted by these people, Lorzatch, they can't even fathom acknowledging your presence here. Like it is disgusting that they even have to listen to the sound of your voice.
Andrew 22:15
Are there other sentries in the room?
Brian 22:18
So there are two sentries, the one on the left barely turns his head, not even the full way around to look at you and just gives you this icy stare that suggests the next time you dare ask a question, their response is going to be physical.
Andrew 22:32
Lorzatch will wait until the medical professional has what he needs and then talk to one or both of the sentries.
Brian 22:39
Okay, let me give a second for the medical professional to ask a couple more questions. ""Is she stable?""
Eddie 22:45
""Yes.""
Brian 22:45
""Is she alive?""
Eddie 22:48
""She is alive.""
Ned 22:49
""She has information about a case that is being tried by the Azorius that they fear threatens the fate of Ravnica as a whole. And she's the only one with the information.""
Sarah 22:59
""Yes, sir.""
Brian 23:00
""I see. Please release her to me, I will go consult the master biomancer. And I'm sure she will want to speak with you immediately.""
Sarah 23:09
""Um, may I please come with her as--""
Brian 23:13
""Absolutely not."" It is so, it is so almost annoyingly academic that the way that they just kind of addressed everything, as if life is nothing more than a beaker, like they just, social contact between them is just not something that they're picking up on. He absolutely will not let any of you out of this room for the moment. He says, ""I cannot let you leave until the master biomancer speaks with you.""
Ned 23:36
""Can you send a message back to District 34?""
Brian 23:39
""And what would you like me to tell them?""
Ned 23:41
""Tell Lavinia of the Azorius that we made it, that we're here, and that are patient is under your care now.""
Brian 23:47
""This is to the barracks at the 34th?""
Ned 23:49
This would be to the Maze Runner of the Azorius.
Brian 23:51
""The Azorius compound is all the way in the 10th District at the Promenade. It's very far away.""
Sarah 23:58
""She's currently at the 34th District building.""
Brian 24:00
""Oh, I see. Yes, I will send a messenger right away.""
Sarah 24:04
Can I roll a Persuasion to be like, 'are you sure you won't let me stay with her?'
Brian 24:09
Yes, please do.
Sarah 24:10
Okay. That would be a lot.
Brian 24:13
Great.
Sarah 24:13
Yeah, that's like a 22... 24.
Brian 24:18
24. That's amazing. He looks at you so sorrowfully. And you finally see an actual bit of connection between him for the first time and he says, ""Oh, you actually care about this woman."" He says, ""I will do the best I can. But at the moment, I cannot have you and your fur...""
Sarah 24:35
Oh.
Brian 24:36
""Inside a facility that I will be taking for her but I promise--what is your name?""
Sarah 24:40
""Fikarra, sir.""
Brian 24:42
""Fikarra, I will find the biomancer and tell her specifically that it may be in her best chance for recovery if she has someone she knows near. I cannot make that decision for her. I will tell her immediately.""
Sarah 24:53
""Thank you.""
Brian 24:54
""As for the rest of you, please remain comfortable. I'm sure the master biomancer would like to speak with you."" You get to little bit of space. You wanted to pick a fight, or not necessarily. But yes.
Andrew 25:06
Lorzatch will ask one of the attending sentries.
Brian 25:09
Yes.
Andrew 25:10
""What is the nature of these nightly incursions?""
Brian 25:13
I need you to roll either a Persuasion or Intimidation check just to be able to get them to engage with you.
Andrew 25:20
11.
Brian 25:20
An 11. I think 11 is enough for them to kind of look at you and like acknowledge your presence and give you this like really sassy like, it's not a verbal command. But it's a look that is like, 'what are you even trying to do right now?'
Andrew 25:37
Continually stonewalled, Lorzatch walks back inside of the room and takes a seat.
Eddie 25:43
""Lorzatch. I noticed you've been frustrated by the way they're treating you. And I apologize that you are going through this, but I will ask you, let me speak. Because I don't think your presence here is very welcome.""
Andrew 25:57
Lorzatch--
Sarah 25:57
""I don't know if they like you very much either.""
Andrew 25:59
Gestures broadly, the men may try his best.
Brian 26:04
You guys do get a brief amount of time here, the equivalent of what would be like a short rest. If anybody needs to have dialogue, catch up with each other before you can expect some sort of official audience.
Ned 26:15
""So, Zenia, I'm still confused why you're here, specifically in this room that we were just heralded into?""
Landree 26:21
""Well, I think because it's, there's so many nice things to look at for me.""
Ned 26:25
What.
Eddie 26:25
""How did you get here?""
Landree 26:29
""Oh, they just brought me here.""
Ned 26:30
""Well, why?""
Landree 26:31
""I couldn't quite tell you.""
""Where you questioned?""
""I wasn't. I was, I was asked a couple questions about Elasia.""
Andrew 26:39
""And the Boros brought you here?""
Landree 26:42
""Yes.""
Ned 26:42
""And you haven't done anything since you left our our company at the, at the murder circus?""
Landree 26:49
""Oh, well, I thought quite a lot.""
Sarah 26:51
Fought or thought?
Landree 26:52
Thought.
Ned 26:53
Oh, not fought.
Landree 26:54
""No, no, no, not, not fought. I've been thinking quite a lot. I've had a nice beautiful full day. Thank you so much for asking.""
Ned 27:01
I'm going to remain confused.
Sarah 27:03
""You didn't run into anything bad on the way here?""
Landree 27:06
""No, it's been perfectly pleasant.""
Ned 27:07
""Good to see you. Welcome back.""
Landree 27:08
""It's nice to see all of you as well. I haven't spoken for quite some time.""
Brian 27:12
She may believe, she probably took an indrik, which is like a two-story-tall llama that is used for transportation.
Sarah 27:19
I want a two-story...
Ned 27:20
Backing up.
Brian 27:21
Yeah, they're great.
Ned 27:26
Okay, Boros are jerks. No offense.
Sarah 27:28
No no, they are. It's all good.
Ned 27:30
Cool.
Eddie 27:30
""Agreed.""
Sarah 27:31
""Well, I mean, maybe it was a test to, um...""
Ned 27:36
""You're the only one who works for them. What are they testing me on?""
Sarah 27:39
""Listen... his boss was the one that showed up and told us we had to do this!""
Ned 27:43
""That's fair. I blame both of you.""
Andrew 27:44
""Oh, and then did us the wonderful favor of binding our fates with one spell that threatens to kill all of us.""
Ned 27:51
Oh yeah, if ever we need to lie, uh, Zenia, you may have to be the one or else we are in trouble.
Landree 27:56
""Oh, I need to lie for us?""
Ned 27:57
""If there's a lie that's needed, it might have to be you.""
Sarah 28:01
Well, no, we just can't lie to each other.
Brian 28:03
Are you guys to, yes, are you going to explain-- just to really the rules of your spiritual bonds, you cannot lie to each other and you are also like held accountable to each other.
Ned 28:13
To each other, for sure.
Brian 28:14
For crimes, which was Lavinia's sort of--
Ned 28:17
Sword thing that went through my arm.
Brian 28:19
It was, it was a goading force to make sure that you all show up together.
Ned 28:24
In a really quick nutshell, we met the Maze Runner of the Azorius, they told us we had to go on a secret mission with seven Boros legionnaires to bring that unconscious Elasia here. We then found a train, that train was full of what could be classified as zombies in other situations. They murdered seven people.
Andrew 28:41
""Please refrain from calling them 'zombies.' They don't resemble the word.""
Ned 28:46
They resemble something that is horrifying and involves maybe weird life caricature-ness and now we're here.
Landree 28:52
""I'm curious to know: why are you so bloody?""
Sarah 28:55
""Well, there was a head that kind of exploded from a mace, so it just kind of got blood everywhere. That's kinda what happens.""
Landree 29:03
""Should we be concerned about any kind of infection now that she's obviously been exposed?""
Andrew 29:09
""Oh no, I wouldn't think so. Not unless you consumed any of it?""
Brian 29:14
What exactly is going on is not necessarily prevalent but you probably have observed her enough to know that there hasn't been any changes to suggest anything fast-acting.
Andrew 29:23
""Did they mention, by any chance, that the deceased in question include among their number one Mr. Gato, AKA the Mustache Man?""
Landree 29:33
""There was no mention of Gato.""
Andrew 29:37
""Well, he's quite deceased now.""
Brian 29:40
Okay, so as you guys are catching each other up and possibly confusing each other even more, you hear the iris to the holding room open up and standing there is a very tall, very pristine, almost angelic merwoman who glides into the room as if she swims even on land and she's, she stands well above all of you, even you, Fikarra, and she takes a moment to kind of address all of you and when she speaks, she has this melodic siren voice that, that suggests she's never in a hurry for anything but she's very deliberate about everything. So she takes you all in and then addresses you, ""I am Vizarra, master biomancer of Zonot 4. When this Izzet League member came into my facility, I suspected it was an internal matter, but now that I see the Boros and the Golgari, I'm growing quite concerned. If it wasn't for the Azorius and Selesnyan enclave, I would suspect something truly underhanded was afoot. I will give you the courtesy if beginning this conversation.""
Eddie 30:47
""Madam, we are here to seek medical help for this woman. And we're here because this woman was abducted by Rakdos cultists. We were able to save her but she is in catatonic state and we believe that she has information that could help us save Ravnica from possible dire harm.""
Brian 31:08
""And you are acting on your own?""
Eddie 31:10
""We are acting--""
Brian 31:10
""Members of opposing guilds?""
Eddie 31:12
""We're acting under the order of Lavinia.""
Andrew 31:15
""The Maze Runner.""
Brian 31:16
""Yes, I believe she's one of the Arbiters. You are acting under her authority?""
Eddie 31:22
""Yes, madam.""
Brian 31:24
""Unlikely. In fact, I know you're lying."" And with a long spindly arm, Eddie, she just reaches out toward your wrist and grabs that invisible chain that Lavinia had strung between the four of you and she just delicately pulls it away as if it were a spider web and you hear this inaudible 'tink' as all the links just sort of fracture and dissipate into the air and she kind of rubs her fingers together like there's something sticky on it and goes, ""Dimir magic. Disgusting.""
Sarah 31:59
Wait, wait?
Andrew 32:00
""The shadow guild.""
Sarah 32:01
But she was, it was--
Andrew 32:03
""To have infiltrated the Azorius--""
Brian 32:05
""You have been given a tongue. Feel free to use it.""
""Does anyone else here have a better understanding of how their voice works?""
Sarah 32:08
""My apologies, ma'am. We were, she came under the guise, or he, it, we were under the belief it was the Azorius. We were sent on, to give equal representation through all the guilds as to not seem threatening so we could get help for this woman.""
Andrew 32:29
""How did you recognize the illusion?""
Brian 32:30
""Ah, there is no illusion. It is simply truth magic. Dimir spies use it all the time. They think they can infiltrate us so cleverly. You've had microbes on you since the moment you walked in here. Our research is quite safe. For, you see, all magic has a smell. And a taste. Azorius is quite bland. Izzet magic is quite sour. But Dimir magic is simply revolting.""
Andrew 33:01
""Have you examined the woman that we placed under your care?""
Brian 33:04
""She is being examined now. We will take our time and be thorough. Still, the question remains. Three of your guilds have a great deal of investment on my property. So I will ask you again: why are you here?""
Ned 33:18
""I'm getting real tired of people assuming I'm lying to them. So I'm going to say this one time, regardless of your stature. We were sent here on authority and we are not here to lie or cheat and I take grave offense to the idea that that would be anything to do with my care.""
Andrew 33:38
""I don't. I quite understand your suspicion because the authority we were sent under appears to have been a false one, one perpetrated by a Dimir operative. She has every right to be most suspicious of us.""
Brian 33:51
""Which could be why the Selesnya were so easily manipulated into rupturing your own guildhall and severing the Guildpact in the first place. So from my standing, I have five different members of five different guilds who walk in here on the leash of a sixth. You're all very concerned with my zonot, with your rail lines, and your wars. The time for being coy is now over.""
Ned 33:51
""An Azorius agent brought the one, why wouldn't an Azorius agent not send the other? A whole lot of people are getting tricked if this is Dimir magic, or the Azorius are working with the Dimir, which is a question for my justicar here.""
Eddie 34:32
""I've told you what I believe to be true.""
Andrew 34:34
""What we all until quite recently believed to be true.""
Landree 34:38
""And quite honestly I'm just curious to know how she is.""
Sarah 34:42
""I am very concerned about their safety as well.""
Andrew 34:46
""I'm most concerned about your guild, Devkarin. It's a surprise to see you above ground.""
""It's a surprise to hear of nightly incursions. I'm afraid this is rather the first I've heard of it. And I would ask humbly--""
Brian 35:00
Make a Wisdom saving throw, please.
Andrew 35:02
Nope.
Brian 35:05
Make a Persuasion or Intimidation check.
Andrew 35:08
7.
Brian 35:11
Yes. ""Has this one been with you for long?""
Ned 35:14
""About as long as all of us have been together.""
Brian 35:16
""Which has been how long?""
Ned 35:17
Two days? Three days?
Brian 35:19
""I see. So you would not have been with the last attack. Are you truly so oblivious to the actions of your guild members below?""
Andrew 35:27
""We cover rather a lot of ground.""
Brian 35:30
""The Golgari Swarm are formulating actual raids. They're trying to bore into the base of our zonot from under the earth. We knew the Boros and Izzet were having their rail disputes. Imagine our surprise to find a third guild involved, unwilling to handle things diplomatically. We've had to defend ourselves several times a week.""
Andrew 35:52
""I will say that that seems rather unusual of us. How would you characterize these reclamation parties?""
Brian 36:00
""Violent.""
Andrew 36:01
""Devkarin? Trolls? Gorgons?""
Brian 36:04
""I believe trolls are the main perpetrators.""
Andrew 36:05
""I see.""
Brian 36:06
""Although they do carry a number of that insectile race, the kraul? Yes, your fungal and undead approaches are not quite to our taste. Impressive, but life-threatening. You tread dangerously close to Guildpact violation.""
Sarah 36:23
""Wait if you, your guild is trying to make a rail car, why wouldn't they just go around the Izzet lands or further below them?""
Brian 36:35
This particular spot was... Ned, do you remember before I exchange about why this spot is so important?
Ned 36:42
It is the the culmination of where the Izzet line would cross, the Boros line would cross, and potentially the Golgari and whoever gets it means the other one would not be able to cross effectively blocking them from their goal.
Brian 36:54
It's a major strategic blocking point where you can advance your goals while at the same time completely cutting off your opponent.
Sarah 37:01
Ah, okay. So I'd probably know that.
Brian 37:04
And it would go through a third party guild's property, which means that they would be completely protected because you wouldn't be able to assault, say, the Boros or the Izzet directly, you would have to pick a war with the Simic. So you end up picking a war with two guilds over as much land as you see on that map. And now it seems like, according to her line, that the Golgari are trying to get in on this major block as well. ""I will afford to you this. Please remain here and make yourselves comfortable. I will inform you when our examination of this Elasia is completed.""
Sarah 37:39
""Thank you.""
Brian 37:41
""I will have food brought and you will be taken care of. Please do not consider this a prison. But for the time being, and for the sake of our patient, please remain out of the way.""
Sarah 37:53
""Yes, ma'am.""
Eddie 37:54
""We appreciate it. Thank you, madam.""
Brian 37:55
""You are as welcome as I can make you. Is there any other information you require before I leave?""
Sarah 37:56
""I realize this may be a question that seems a bit silly because you're so good at what you do. Is there any way we may be of help?""
Brian 38:10
""I really don't suppose a Boros legionnaire has a background in science nor do the rest of you. As for your Izzet companion, we tend not to commingle with their kind. They study the inorganic while we study life. That matters.""
Sarah 38:25
""Well, if there is anything that our group may be more attuned to, please let us know if we can assist.""
Brian 38:32
""You can remain here. Thank you.""
Sarah 38:34
""Yes, ma'am.""
Andrew 38:35
Is the master biomancer the foremost authority in Zonot 4?
Brian 38:40
In Zonot 4, yes, she is the foremost authority. So each guild has its own hierarchy, right. So like we met Lavinia and she's pretty high up in her guild so in the science-based guilds, which are the Simic and the Izzet, their higher up ranking, one of the ranks is the master, so for the Simic you have master biomancers and then for the Izzet you would have master researchers within their given colleges.
Sarah 39:06
""Thank you very much for your time, master biomancer.""
Brian 39:08
Yeah, she doesn't really acknowledge you but she gives a polite bow to the room and then just glides out with that awkward motion that land based mammals can't really seem to reproduce.
Landree 39:18
""That was fine.""
Andrew 39:19
Lorzatch is obviously displeased, and his face is changing a number of different colors as he tries to get comfortable in one of these strange biomechanical chairs.
Brian 39:29
Without much effort that you notice that her assistant has stayed. She's just sort of hovering around the area for anything that you guys might need.
Landree 39:38
Her assistant is also a mer-person?
Brian 39:41
All of the people that you have seen in this particular zonot are either merfolk, or they are some sort of biologically altered elven race.
Ned 39:51
Did we get the name of the assistant?
Sarah 39:53
I was just gonna, unless you want to.
Ned 39:55
""Hello, if we're going to be in a room together for a while, it'd be nice to have names. Who are you?""
Brian 40:00
Her name is Zavi.
Ned 40:02
""Zavi. Hello.""
Brian 40:03
She seems very young and eager to please, perhaps maybe a bit embarrassed by the coldness of her master biomancer. The Simic are very cold and in an, not inattentive way, but they are just sort of aloof, but she's at least pleasant. Not dismissive.
Ned 40:18
Zavi, is there anything you can tell us about what, what in god's name is going on right now?
Brian 40:22
""In regards to what?""
Ned 40:23
""Pretty much anything, it's been a whirlwind couple of days and it feels like the only people who seem to have any idea of what is happening isn't the five of us.""
Brian 40:31
""Well, the compound is spend under a great deal of pressure recently. What can I say? The rail wars just sort of taking a chunk out of everyone in Ravnica.""
Ned 40:41
""Did they tell you why we're here?""
Brian 40:43
""I am the biomancer's assistant, my job is to do as she bids. She asked me to stay here and look after you.""
Landree 40:49
Have I interacted with her during my day?
Brian 40:52
Yeah.
Landree 40:52
Okay, I'm familiar with her. Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Brian 40:55
Probably. She's, she's probably been just pleasant.
Landree 40:58
Yeah.
Brian 40:58
You two are probably friendly to each other at this point. She doesn't seem to, she doesn't seem to be bothered that you're from the Izzet. But she does sort of reiterate things that you've already heard that she says, ""Well, many of your guilds are trying to gain access to our land to continue rails and I've heard the biomancer speak all the time that the Simic just aren't really a part of this problem. We already have access to the waterways and the oceans. We have no need of public transport. We have our own.""
Eddie 41:27
""Out of curiosity, does the name Mr. Alfonso mean anything to you?""
Brian 41:31
""Oh, yes.""
""Yeah.""
Eddie 41:32
""Really?""
""What can you tell me about him?""
Brian 41:35
""Mr. Alfonso is a wonderful man. I spoke to him yesterday.""
Andrew 41:38
""Has he by any chance been asking about his engine?""
Brian 41:40
""Yes.""
Andrew 41:42
""We passed him on the way in.""
Brian 41:44
""Would you believe he had a train and half of it went missing?""
Sarah 41:48
""Only half?""
Brian 41:50
""Can you believe it?""
Eddie 41:50
""What does he look like?""
Brian 41:52
""Oh, well. He's human, unmodified,"" which you get the sense is more of a derogatory statement, than sort of an acknowledgement. ""An older man, I suspect for human age.""
Ned 42:06
""Any guild alignment that you know of?""
Brian 42:08
""Oh, no, no.""
Andrew 42:10
""I don't suppose there'd be any chance of you summoning him here, would there?""
Brian 42:14
""From my understanding the biomancer's business with Mr. Alfonso is over.""
Andrew 42:19
""I see.""
Brian 42:19
""I mean, he hangs out every once in a while, but he really has no need to call on the Combine anymore.""
Ned 42:25
Is he here now?
Brian 42:26
""He's still within the zonot. Yes.""
Eddie 42:28
""Would there be any way we could have a parley with him?""
Andrew 42:31
""Because we happen to--""
""We did find half of his train. It happened to be full of what used to be his former people. I don't suppose you're aware of any mutagenic serum that would induce such features as claws and fangs?""
Brian 42:32
""If I see him again, I will certainly announce you, but for now, I'm under the interpretation that you were meant to wait here for Master Vizarra.""
""If you're asking about this facility, we do not deal with humanoids. We're specifically an aquatic creature research facility. And we lease the land of the waterfall to the Izzet for the hydroelectric power. If you're asking if we modify people, that's not our facility."" She's not really even offended by the question. She's just sort of offended that they could possibly be wasting their time doing something other than what they do here.
Landree 43:18
Can I ask as, as far as like the doors out of this room?
Brian 43:22
Yes.
Landree 43:23
There's two. Yes?
Brian 43:24
Yes. So you are currently in the room to the right, sorry, those are not rooms. Those are tanks filled with fluid. There are two doors that lead out that sort of, you know, arc that you see.
There, there are two doors that lead into that little foyer and that is the entrance out.
Landree 43:35
Yeah.
Ned 43:40
And there are two separate little rooms here.
Brian 43:42
Yes.
Ned 43:42
Yeah.
Landree 43:43
Are we locked inside?
Ned 43:45
We haven't really tested to find out.
Brian 43:47
Well, I mean, at the moment, you're all in the room on the right. Zavi's there sort of in the doorway, that door is open, the door behind her is closed. And you did see as the biomancer entered and exited that there are sentries outside that door.
Landree 44:03
Okay.
Brian 44:03
You're being protected. ""Do you know Mr. Alfonso?""
Ned 44:08
""Never met him. Ran into his goons, though, twice now.""
Brian 44:11
""Oh, he's a great guy.""
Ned 44:12
""His goons are less great.""
Brian 44:14
""Goons?""
Ned 44:14
""The men he sends to kidnap people and then try to kill us with.""
Brian 44:19
""I think you have the wrong man that you're talking about. Mr. Alfonso is a very nice man and a scholar.""
Ned 44:24
""We would love to talk to him to clear up this misunderstanding.""
Brian 44:28
""Well, if I see him again, I'll certainly know that you--""
Ned 44:31
""Could we send a sentry to get him?""
Brian 44:32
""I don't think the biomancer would like that very much, but I could carry a message with me if it was ever to see him again.""
""Is Mr. Alfonso in some sort of trouble?""
Ned 44:38
""Could we make sure that you were to see him again? Could we send you with a message? We're not looking to wander the zonot. We understand our rules. But we would like to talk to Mr. Alfonso, and we do find it pressing that we get to him immediately.""
""No, in fact, we're worried that we are and we want to clear the air.""
Brian 44:57
""I see."" Give me some sort of Persuasion check please.
Ned 45:02
That is a natural 20. So a 22.
Brian 45:07
Yeah, she's actually now incredibly concerned. She seems like she knows him on a personal basis. And is, ""Yes, I, I will make an actual effort to see if I can find Mr. Alfonso and communicate that he might be in an incredible amount of danger. I also will speak to the biomancer and allow her to understand that perhaps there is more at stake here than she's willing to take on in this particular compound. Again, please make yourselves as comfortable as you can. And we will fetch for you when we are ready."" And she kind of flitters out into the room. She just kind of scurries out in a bit of a hurried manner. Atypical to what you've seen so far about the Simic guild members. You are now alone in a room. It's quite comfortable. There's some kelp you can eat, some water. Looks very clean.
Ned 45:54
I have a question. Now that we're alone. And I'm sorry, Zenia, you were not there. Did she just say that we got Dimir magicked?
Andrew 46:01
""Oh, the question now is not if we've been deceived, but for how long?""
Ned 46:07
And by who? And how many people were deceived? We know that Lavinia was either a fake Lavinia or a deceived Lavinia and I'm not sure which is more terrifying.
Eddie 46:16
I'm deeply concerned that I handed her that orb.
Ned 46:20
You gave her the sphere.
Andrew 46:22
""Well, we do know who can tell us at least something about what that might be.""
Ned 46:26
Who's that?
Andrew 46:27
""Mr. Alfonso.""
Ned 46:28
Second question: is Mr. Alfonso Dimir? And is this fourth train a Dimir train? Is it rich people or is it horrible, awful, sub... What's the word I'm looking for?
Brian 46:40
-versive?
Ned 46:41
Yeah, subversive people.
Brian 46:43
That's why I'm at the head of the table.
Ned 46:44
Thanks. I'm also at the head of the table just--
Brian 46:46
No, you are at the foot of the table.
Andrew 46:49
""I'm sorry. Did you want an answer to this? Because these all seem wildly rhetorical to me at this point.""
Ned 46:53
Great. Does anyone have any idea what's going on? We have four trains and we thought it was rich people but now we have a rich dude sending not-zombies after us. And--
Andrew 47:02
Thank you.
Ned 47:02
You're so welcome. And I'm a little worried that we just got Dimir'd and we might have been being Dimir'd.
Sarah 47:09
""What if my entire life has been a lie? What if, what if the Dimir are actually controlling the Boros? And it's actually the Dimir Legion and the captain isn't really the captain--""
Ned 47:19
This is a good question: who, what happened to the Boros dudes, they got led on by this too.
Sarah 47:26
""Oh my god, I'm a traitor to my legion.""
Andrew 47:29
""Several of them were killed by mutants, if that's any consolation.""
Ned 47:34
It's not.
Sarah 47:34
No. It's not. At all.
Landree 47:37
""I'm curious to know. I was also brought here by a woman named Lavinia.""
Ned 47:40
""You were brought here?""
Eddie 47:41
""What?""
Landree 47:42
""Yes, correct.""
Andrew 47:43
""This would have been yesterday?""
Landree 47:46
""Yes.""
Andrew 47:46
""What time of day? Yesterday?""
Brian 47:49
It would have been slightly more before. You would have been, you would have been--
Ned 47:55
So Zenia left us before we went to bed that night.
Brian 47:58
Yes. So Zenia never made it back to the compound with you. She was detained somewhere else. And then on the same day that you left, she was brought here. So she has been here about a full day, whereas you guys just arrived this morning.
Ned 48:14
So, uh, did she walk you in here?
Brian 48:17
No, she would have delivered her to the front.
Ned 48:20
So they saw Lavinia deliver her here.
Brian 48:23
Possibly.
Ned 48:24
That's a question. Didn't tell them we were coming, one, two, they haven't mentioned the fact that we've brought her up like 30 billion times.
Andrew 48:33
""This is a separate concern entirely but we need to be prepared for the fact, the possibility, that the woman we delivered in a catatonic state--""
Ned 48:42
Some kind of subversive plot?
Andrew 48:43
""Could be a ticking time bomb.""
Ned 48:45
Yeah.
Sarah 48:45
She's the weapon.
Ned 48:46
Yeah.
Sarah 48:47
Oh, no.
Andrew 48:48
""She could be the catastrophe.""
Sarah 48:49
Oh, no.
Landree 48:50
""She is not, I don't think she's the weapon.""
Andrew 48:53
""And why don't you think that?""
Landree 48:56
""Just from, from reasoning, from my experience with her, she doesn't seem as though she is being utilized in that way.""
Ned 49:03
She's currently comatose and has been put in that way medically by the person we all know as Lavinia.
Andrew 49:09
""A pre-cognitive mage who had no firm memory--""
Ned 49:12
But we only she's a pre-cognitive mage because of the deceptor.
Andrew 49:15
""True. We can trust that either.""
Sarah 49:17
Bet you she didn't see that one coming.
Andrew 49:36
""I give the minotaur Inspiration.""
Brian 49:41
And on that note, all of the lights go down and alarms start ringing throughout the zonot.
Sarah 49:49
Oh hell.
Ned 49:51
I would like to knock on the door and open it up for the, see what the sentries are doing.
Brian 49:55
So there is a great deal of noise happening on the other side of this mucous membrane that is your door and through all the shouting and the order-giving and the alarms you can barely make out one of the sentries as he kind of shouts through the door to you, ""Please stay where you are!"" And the chaos is starting to really get to you guys as the alarms sound and it's not like sirens, it's whatever aquamarine life would consider to be an alarm so there are like streaks of bioluminescent lights flashing everywhere and it's really an assault on the senses.
Sarah 50:27
So it's basically an underwater rave right now.
Brian 50:30
It, yes, except not one you're enjoying
It takes a little bit of time for you guys to kind of just sit in there and wonder and question what in the living hell could possibly be going on.
Ned 50:45
Did we lose our weaponry when we...
Brian 50:46
No, you still have all of your gear, that was never taken from you. As you guys begin to sense the panic of the entire zonot you do take a moment to go through all of your things and make sure you're prepared for whatever is about to come through that door. And through the door it comes and the mucous membrane opens up and there standing alone is master biomancer Vizarra who has lost all sense of composure and everything just hangs on her a lot heavier than you saw before. And she just glares at each of you with this horrific panic and says, ""What have you done? What have you brought here?""
On the next Encounter Party! Something unspeakable has come to Zonot 4! It's so horrific, we won't speak about it! See you next week, on Encounter Party!

Last time on Encounter Party: to solve the murders, our heroes became unwilling players in a murderous circus act. However, the identity of the murdered man is still a mystery. The festival may be over, but it seems Azorius arresters are coming to call. Who is this Maze Runner and what do they want with our players? Find out this week on Encounter Party!
Hello, ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to the Encounter Party. My name is Brian David Judkins and I am your Dungeon Master. With me this week are Andrew Krug, Eddie Cooper, Ned Donovan and Sarah Babe. Let's get this party started. The Guildpact, that magical peace treaty that binds the guilds of Ravnica, has not always existed. 75 years ago, the Guildpact was shattered in a devious plot by the House Dimir, guild of secrets. For most of our players' lives, the Guildpact was a history lesson. Four years ago, the Izzet guild leader, a powerful dragon nicknamed the Firemind, proposed a competition to end the power struggle for good. Ten champions were chosen, one for each guild, to run a maze throughout Ravnica activating ancient magical pathways. Whoever won would win the hidden power of Ravnica for their guild. In truth, something very different happened, something known only to the very elite of each guild, but at the end of said events, the Guildpact was reinstated. Each Maze Runner has received celebrity status and are well known, especially within their guilds. For the Azorius, that would be a woman named Lavinia, one of the trio that are second in command to their guild leader. Captain Farland points past the group to the door and says, ""You might be in a great deal more trouble than I thought. That is the Azorius maze runner."" And, Lennox, as you turn, you can see Lavinia walking in the door.
Eddie 2:04
I bow to her.
Brian 2:05
You can hear her voice as she kind of comes in and she says, ""Not just a Maze Runner. I am Arbiter of the Lyev Column and I will be shown the respect of my office, is that clear, captain?"" The four of you turn around to see the room part for this stern woman who looks like justice herself. She's wearing full armor, the blue and white of the arresters, she has a blue half-cowl stretched over her head, and all about her belt and bandolier she has an arsenal of spell scrolls, but by the look of her, she probably doesn't need them to deal with you. She has this incredible,
regal poise about her and she announces herself to the four of you. ""I am Lavinia, second hand of Isperia. I take it these are they?"" Captain Farland, who is the captain of an entire battalion, looks very dwarfed in the presence of this woman and just sort of nods his head and, ""Yes, ma'am, these are they."" And she says, ""Good. As for you, Captain,"" and from her bandolier she pulls out one of these scrolls and unfurls it in the air and she waves her hand across it and
blue tendrils of script start pouring out of it and they snake their way across the room and wrap themselves around Captain Farland's head and mouth. And she says, ""You and your men are under a decree of silence over this matter. As for the four of you, come with me."" And you feel compelled to follow her as if it's not entirely your choice. And she leads you through the barracks to some back rooms that are used for interrogation and you're all sort of forcibly sat around this large table and Lavinia positions herself between you and the door to block you guys in and she puts her hand up as soon as you enter and with a small conjuration, this blue sort of blanket of light envelops the room in the doorway. Lennox, you would know this as some sort of privacy spell. People outside won't be able to hear, they may not even be able to see you depending on the strength of the purpose of the spell. ""Now we won't be disturbed but before we begin, let's get rid of these pathetic things, shall we?"" She reaches out to each of your chests and just tugs away that Boros insignia that Captain Farland had placed there and they just dissipate into the air like smoke. And then Lavinia loses all sense of regalness. In fact, this sort of scary animosity builds behind her eyes and she slams both hands down on the table and gets right in your grill. Can everybody please make a Charisma saving throw?
Andrew 4:25
7.
Brian 4:26
Low.
Sarah 4:28
8.
Ned 4:28
18.
Brian 4:29
Okay.
Eddie 4:30
Six.
Brian 4:31
So, I would say that all of you are pretty PO'd except for the Selesnyan, who probably has enough respect and care to know that she's on the side of good so he's not--
Ned 4:45
She's not in a bad, like a jerk?
Brian 4:47
No, Lavinia is just being very intense about this. Something is clearly disturbing her about events that happened. For the rest of you, this is so high up the chain of command, it's alarming. It'd be like if the chief of police showed up at your front door to investigate your stolen car and she doubles in on this intensity and just says, ""Now, what exactly did you learn about Malphus Reed?""
Sarah 5:14
""Malphus Reed?""
Ned 5:15
I think you'll take by our silence that we did not learn about Malphus Reed.
Brian 5:18
""Do not make me force your confession or I will stuff you into a detainment sphere the size of a handbag.""
Ned 5:27
Well, it is quite possible that we did learn about Malphus Reed but who is Malphus Reed? Because we didn't really get names.
Brian 5:32
""The man who was murdered. You were there.""
Ned 5:36
Oh, in the tavern.
Andrew 5:37
""The woman in question who was with him the night of his murder did not get his name and thus neither did we.""
""Elasia is one of mine.""
Eddie 5:47
""Yours?""
Andrew 5:48
""An Azorius agent?""
Brian 5:50
""She's a precognitive mage. Elasia had a vision that Malphus Reed was up to something dangerous--in her words, 'catastrophic.'""
Andrew 6:01
""May I ask how a precognitive mage could find herself in such a position?""
Brian 6:07
You may ask.
Andrew 6:08
Will I get an answer?
Brian 6:10
""I do not answer questions from the undercity, especially the Golgari. Let us not forget what it is that you did.""
Andrew 6:19
""And what you did.""
Brian 6:20
""Yes. And as Maze Runner, I personally helped reverse your treachery. I'm not here for this discussion, under-citizen.""
Eddie 6:30
We discovered his animated corpse at a murder circus.
Andrew 6:35
""The, ah, limbs and head anyway.""
Sarah 6:37
Yes.
Brian 6:38
""And where is the body now?""
Andrew 6:39
""The torso was taken by the Boros, as I suspect were the limbs and the head after they claimed the scene for theirs.""
Brian 6:47
""And what happened to Elasia?""
Ned 6:48
We weren't part of the investigation once we call in the Boros.
Sarah 6:51
I would imagine she's being detained here? Or protected?
Brian 6:56
She was kidnapped by the Rakdos?
Sarah 6:58
Yes.
Brian 6:59
""Well now, the Rakdos certainly do have a way of mucking things up. Unfortunately, it seems Malphus Reed was nothing more than a random victim of Rakdos festivities. As much as I appreciate his death, we still don't know what he's up to. More importantly, how much danger we're in if his plans are still in motion. I need to know what Elasia knows. Because as of right now, she is unresponsive.""
Ned 7:28
She refused to tell us anything. We came in and we, she claimed that whoever dismembered, who she could not identify, came in the door, persuaded her through suggestion to go into the corner, at which point she screamed. And then the culprit broke the window and left.
Andrew 7:49
""With the severed limbs and head of one Malphus Reed.""
Brian 7:53
Can everybody please make a Wisdom saving throw?
Andrew 7:59
19.
Ned 7:59
18.
Sarah 8:00
Two.
Brian 8:01
Great.
Eddie 8:02
23.
Brian 8:03
A 23 is quite good, however, you are Azorius so it's unlikely that you're going to resist this. So what she asks of the four of you, what she demands from the four of you, is that you all put your arm out with your wrists up.
Eddie 8:19
I do it.
Sarah 8:20
Done.
Ned 8:20
Yeah sure.
Brian 8:21
She then very quickly draws the sword from her hip and slashes as if she's going to lop all of your hands off. It does not. The sword passes spectrally through all of them. But as you look down, what you immediately find is that there is like a spiritual shackle that now ties all of you together in sort of a spell like fashion. It doesn't have any physical restraint, but you do feel a tug on your inner self.
Sarah 8:47
Oh, this is unpleasant.
Brian 8:49
This is the type of spell that locks people into fate. You have never seen this before. But it is possible that you've heard of something this high-level. And she looks at all of you and she says, ""Now that I know all of you were there, none of you may lie to each other on this subject. If any one of you tries to sell out the other members of this party, I don't think you want to know what this will do. Now I ask you again. What did Elasia reveal?""
Sarah 9:17
""I was watching the door to the tavern, ma'am.""
Ned 9:20
Quite amazingly. I didn't lie in the first place.
Eddie 9:22
""That's, that's all that I know of Elasia. But there is this,"" and I take out the sphere.
Brian 9:28
Oh.
Eddie 9:29
Wrapped in my cloak.
Brian 9:29
Her eyes get very big.
Sarah 9:32
Oh, that's not good.
Brian 9:33
She doesn't even ask what it is. She just says, ""Arrester. I think perhaps it's best if you leave that in my care.""
Eddie 9:41
I place it on the table.
Ned 9:42
Don't touch it barehanded.
Brian 9:44
She puts on one of her gloves and tucks the orb away behind her cloak and says, ""We need to know what Elasia knows and for that she will need medical attention. The kind she won't find here in this barracks. The Simic guild has a medical facility not too far off from here and we need to get her there. However, the ongoing rail dispute is going to make that a bit of a problem."" Would everyone please make an Intelligence check.
Andrew 10:12
20.
Eddie 10:12
7.
Brian 10:13
Great.
Sarah 10:14
Two.
Brian 10:15
Two.
Ned 10:16
11.
Brian 10:16
Wow, you have a very sheltered life in the barracks.
Sarah 10:21
All I've known is the Boros.
Brian 10:23
'I play the drums on the drummin' the face.'
Sarah 10:28
Boom Boom to the face.
Brian 10:30
So based on your rolls, you all probably have different levels of understanding about a current situation at hand. Although, baseline, you all would know that recently within Ravnica, there have been rail lines being constructed in an attempt to create some sort of mass transportation system. Lavinia breaks it down a little bit more and says, ""The Guildpact has many different purposes. Sure, it protects Ravnica from all-out guild war, but one of its purposes is to protect the guilds from interfering into each others' businesses. The Rakdos are not going to create a court system anytime soon. The Golgari are not likely to suddenly enter into banks and loans. However, there is no transportation market at the moment. Which means the first guild to complete its trans-Ravnican system will immediately monopolize the market under the protection of the Guildpact. There are four lines up for contention at the moment. The Boros Legion is building one for military transport. We at the Azorius Senate have cast our lot in with them. The Izzet League are certainly not wasting an opportunity to invent something. Although what the Firemind's intentions are, we do not know, which is why your little vedalken friend is currently under detainment. Now the Golgari Swarm apparently is building one underground, and they seem to be making a great deal more progress than the other three. I certainly look forward to having a conversation about that, under-citizen. As for the fourth, it is not guild-affiliated. A couple of wealthy private citizens are doing their damnedest to keep the transportation market out of guild control. I am not concerned about that one. It is the other three that are causing a problem. You see, the three guild lines have converged on a piece of Simic property where our research facility happens to lie. Zonot #4 is a medical station built in an underwater sinkhole. But the Simic Combine is not involved in the rail war, nor do they intend to. If we do not play this carefully, they will reject anything we propose, assuming that we are part of some sort of rail war plot. But we need to get Elasia to that research facility. This is where you come in. If my justicar was to bring a member of each of the contending guilds, along with the Selesnyan emissary, we might be able to convince them that our goal has nothing to do with the rail conflict. And we can get exactly what is inside of Elasia's head. You will take her to Zonot #4, you will retrieve what is inside her head or I promise you catastrophe is on the horizon.""
""Yes, ma'am.""
Eddie 13:10
""Yes, madam.""
Andrew 13:11
""What catastrophe?""
Brian 13:13
""I don't know. But she might.""
Eddie 13:16
I tell her about Mr. Alfonso and the abduction of, with Gato.
Brian 13:22
""I do not know who these men are. Must I worry about them?""
Eddie 13:25
""They were after the orb.""
Ned 13:27
Mr. Alfonso is a man of great wealth, who holds great status in the non-affiliated ranks of Ravnica. His underling, Mr. Gato, came and attacked a man at the bar we were all having a quiet drink at, who held the sphere you now have in your possession. What Mr. Alfonso meant to do with it? We don't even know what it is, however, he abducted a man in broad daylight, attacking within a public space.""
Andrew 13:52
""And thus why we are all here in front of you now.""
Eddie 13:55
""And that man held that sphere in his bare hands.""
Andrew 13:57
""Which you seem to recognize is an object of some power.""
Brian 14:01
""That does not concern me.""
Ned 14:03
Great.
Brian 14:03
""Do not worry about this orb. I will take care of this. I'm more concerned about the knowledge Elasia has inside of her head, and I want to find it now.""
Eddie 14:13
""We will take her where she needs to go, madam.""
Brian 14:15
""I will commission Captain Farland to release a unit of soldiers to escort you there. However, therein lies another problem. Our Boros line is currently dead.""
Ned 14:25
Dead like someone died, or dead like there's no power?
Brian 14:29
""As in, I cannot summon a rail car to transport you. Because all of ours have disappeared.""
Ned 14:35
Man, we could really use that Izzet right now.
Andrew 14:37
And seeing--
Brian 14:38
They may be very well the part of the problem.
Ned 14:41
Well, that's reassuring.
Brian 14:45
She says, ""Prepare yourselves. In the morning you will be escorted to the Simic zonot where you will give her medical care and you will remain there until you have found out what you have found out and you will remain as emissaries of peace and protection.""
Andrew 14:59
What time is it now?
Brian 15:00
I would say dinnertime, the Festival of the Guildpact is winding down. It's getting close to pack away time.
Ned 15:09
So we return to the Leg End to rest before a big day. Are we moving at night?
Brian 15:13
No. You will, you will leave on the morrow.
Ned 15:15
Great.
Andrew 15:16
""And what would you have us do between now and then?""
Brian 15:19
""Prepare yourselves for going away for a couple days. Have I made myself clear?""
Eddie 15:25
Yes.
Brian 15:26
""Good. Dismissed.""
Andrew 15:28
Lorzatch goes to enjoy the festival.
Brian 15:33
Also make sure you subtract money necessary, at least 200 zibs for staying
Andrew 15:39
For another night.
Brian 15:39
Another night.
Andrew 15:40
Yeah.
Eddie 15:43
About that?
Brian 15:43
Yes.
Eddie 15:45
I have no money.
Ned 15:46
I already covered you. I told you.
Eddie 15:47
Oh, thank you.
Ned 15:48
Yeah.
Brian 15:49
You guys have an evening of downtime to engage in any activities that you wish to do.
Andrew 15:56
Lorzatch will see what is available within the vicinity that they seem to be stuck in for the moment.
Brian 16:03
There is, there are still some food vendors on the street trying to get rid of the last that they have. Actually a lot of things are probably on discount at this point. Some of the more consistent wares, well some of the consistent wares you know, they're going to be peddled somewhere else at their stores or something like that. So many of the things of quality are probably already packed up at this point, the music has all been gone by now. You're kind of on the back end scraps if you'd like to take, but financially affordable.
Sarah 16:30
I'd like to kind of scout out the most likely path we're going to travel, to see what potential dangers we might encounter.
Brian 16:39
So you are going, there is a rail line that runs, it's on the, it's on the ground
Sarah 16:46
Okay.
Brian 16:46
Sort of like a tramway system, but higher power. And it connects very close to the 34th Precinct so that they have access to troops, but it clearly runs farther back into the city and then extends you now know it's next sort of stop would be this Simic research compound, which is a little ways off. So you guys will be following that rail line, as it is the least obstructive route to get to where you're going.
Ned 17:18
Okay, as a person who researches and who likes to have knowledge, this is a moment where I would probably try and go learn a bunch about the rail lines.
Brian 17:26
What is your background?
Ned 17:27
Sage. Researcher.
Brian 17:28
Cool.
Ned 17:29
So I would, I would say like using the researcher background?
Brian 17:32
Yes.
Ned 17:32
I would say like, is there anyone in my educational sphere that I could go to, a book, a thing, a person that I could go learn more about the war that we're up against?
Brian 17:41
Well, the line that is immediately in front of you is the Boros line.
Ned 17:45
Right.
Brian 17:45
So chatting with people in the barracks would be the best thing.
Ned 17:49
That's exactly what I would--
Brian 17:50
You can get an audience with Captain Farland. He's probably the man you would like to talk to.
Andrew 17:54
Is the rail line above or below ground?
Brian 17:56
It is on the ground.
Andrew 17:57
It is on the ground.
Brian 17:58
Yes.
Ned 17:59
So that's what I would like to do: gain some knowledge about the the war. I mean, I guess specifically, we'd be looking at the Boros and I'd probably be trying to discern, based on the conversation with Captain Farland, if I can discern any reason that the Boros line would be down.
Brian 18:11
Sure.
Ned 18:11
But it's more about the research, less about the investigation.
Brian 18:13
Sure. So everyone is so exhausted, you can hear the drunk people that are detained in just about every corner of the barracks at this point, people have been working triple shifts, Captain Farland himself is so unfathomably tired, that he doesn't really provide much authoritative resistance, right? You manage to walk your way in. Thankfully, the Selesnya and the Boros have a rather respectable relationship to each other because they kind of both consider themselves good guys. But the Selesnya are very... The Boros feel that the Selesnya are a bit too goody-two-shoes, and they're not really willing to kind of put force in where it's needed.
Ned 18:53
For sure.
Brian 18:54
And you don't really need to try and get along with people. Sometimes you just need to put them in their place. But as of right now, he doesn't really have the energy to do that. So he's willing to connect to you a little bit more on your level, but he is not exactly happy that you are still around.
Ned 19:08
We're going home soon. And I can't tell you where we're headed. Due to the conversation we had that was not for your ears. But I would like to say that we're here to help. And I have some questions about the rail line.
Brian 19:19
""Oh yes, I'm sorry. Perhaps in this entire weekend I failed to introduce myself. I am the captain of the 34th Precinct. I know exactly where you are going. I am giving you the troops to get there.""
Ned 19:32
Oh, well, that's good.
Brian 19:33
""As for why, I do not care. Once you are done with my soldiers, you are to send them immediately home. Although I do hear you are taking Private Fikarra Ordruun with you. I, for one, could not be happier.""
Sarah 19:48
[sad noise]
Ned 19:48
We hear from outside the door.
Sarah 19:52
Sad cow noise.
Andrew 19:53
So no, no longer hazda then but restored to the rank of private?
Brian 19:57
Yes, yes, it was only until the end of the weekend. Or as tomorrow morning, you will be restored to your position. ""Now what more could you possibly want with me?""
Ned 20:08
I would like to know about the Boros rail line.
Brian 20:10
""What in particular?""
Ned 20:11
I'd like to know the route you've decided to take and what resources you are dedicating to building it.
Brian 20:17
""We got word that the Izzet were creating some sort of transportation device by laying metal rails along the streets of Ravnica. Thankfully the Azorius pre-cogs were paying attention. And they quickly sussed out what this loophole meant in terms of the Guildpact. So we entered a treaty. Perhaps the best thing for Ravnica is if the military and the court systems were in control of this monopoly, instead of some of the more selfish-minded guilds. We got contracts with the Rakdos for metal and smelting as well as cheap labor. But the Izzet continue to pull resources out of their asses. The real competition, however, is underground with the Golgari Swarm. Whatever tunneling mushrooms or whatever there is they're using are making more progress than the rest of the three of us combined. The real problem here, however, is that all of us have met some sort of stop-gap here with the Simic Combine. You see, it's not just about creating the rail line, we've gotten Gruul demolition teams to help us condemn some slums. We've acquired some property with eminent domain and we've actually received a great deal of consultation on how to build our line in the most efficient manner. However, it is a chess game: you must build yours for the maximum reach while also doing your best to cut off your adversaries. That's why this zonot is such an important piece of property. Whichever one of us can get the treaty contract to build our rail line across the Simic zonot will eventually cut off their opponents from possibly completing their rail lines altogether. It's a very tenuous situation, except those damn fish people aren't really willing to work with either of us because they have no stake in the matter whatsoever.""
Ned 21:55
And what seems to have caused the Boros line to have stopped?
Brian 21:59
""We're not entirely sure. You see, about two weeks ago, we sent out a rail engine to try another bid with the Simic before the festival. It never came back. We're not going to send another one out without finding out what happened, but the Simic won't talk to us. You see, Zonot #4 is a direct extension of the Simic guild hall, which means anything within that compound is protected by Guildpact. More strange still, the waterfall attached to that sinkhole is currently being leased out to the Izzet League. They've built a hydro electric power plant there that they're using to power the entire district. What we can't understand is why the Simic, with their relationship, have not already given the Izzet construction rights for their rail line. In fact, they seem to be holding all three of us at bay, but it is a losing battle. If we didn't already have a centaur in the race, I would have bet money on the Izzet a long time ago.""
Ned 22:50
Thank you for your time.
Brian 22:51
""Oh yes, by all means come back any time and waste my day.""
Ned 22:55
You're welcome.
Brian 22:56
""How quickly are you leaving?""
Ned 22:57
About as fast as we solved your murders.
Brian 23:00
""Half a day. Great. Bye."" And he kind of aggravatingly just sort of shoves you out of the office.
Ned 23:07
Great.
Brian 23:08
Whatever gets you out, however nice he has to be. But this man is pretty much done with this weekend. As you kind of walk around, Fikarra, as you kind of walk around the rail line, it seems pretty empty. I mean, it's just, it's just a track of metal that has been laid out and run through the city. I mean, it is Ravnica. Everything is built on top of things that are built on top of other things. And it seems like the safest thing for them to have done is to just build this one on the ground, most likely actually because there are probably war engines and other massive equipment that the Boros would want to load onto their trains. Instead of just making them some sort of commuter line or anything such as. It's very easy to tell that there have been buildings that have been demolished by the Gruul clans, by contract, to kind of create this lane, probably not in a respectful manner. And it, and it appears like anyone who has kind of been left with a window now facing a train line does not necessarily have the greatest property value anymore.
Andrew 24:12
Would anyone at the market be selling herbs that could potentially empower Lorzatch's herbalism kit?
Brian 24:20
Ah, yes.
Andrew 24:22
And also, he would be on the lookout for certain reagents such as wychwood and sumac, or whatever equivalent of sumac exists on Ravnica.
Brian 24:32
Um, give me an Investigation.
Andrew 24:36
21.
Brian 24:36
Great. There is one vendor still kicking around. There's a nice young woman, human, who seems to be trying her darnedest to see if she can get some of this stuff sold and then is kind of regretting being in the location of the Rakdos and the Orzhov because probably not a crowd of people in Theater Row. It very quickly looks like she misread where she was going to set up her stand and she's pretty bummed.
Andrew 25:05
""Happy New Year.""
Brian 25:08
She looks at you and she goes, ""Oh, yes,"" she goes, ""Everything I have is from the undercity."" She says, ""I buy all of my herbs from a really nice Golgari farmer. She says, ""Please, please, look, look, look, look, look, look.""
Andrew 25:22
Lorzatch makes small talk. ""Would you happen to know their name?""
Ned 25:27
Lorzatch small talk is something I am horrified by.
Brian 25:30
Yes. She says, ""Yes. I work with a lovely older woman named Lavanna who is a Devkarin farmer in the undercity. She finds a great deal of market up here but she's not really a fan of coming above ground.""
Andrew 25:43
""I can't imagine why."" And Lorzatch--
Brian 25:44
""I can."" She kind of, she kind of, she kind of gestures around, she's like, ""It's not really my favorite part of the city to be.""
Andrew 25:52
And Lorzatch will ask for any wychwood, sumac, and other miscellaneous medicinal herb that she might have available.
Brian 26:01
I would say anything common. The first two is available. Anything you're looking for that's a bit more on the magic item stance is not really in her...
Andrew 26:12
So he will instead ask the price for the common reagents, the wychwood and the sumac.
Brian 26:19
Are you trying to acquire enough to use later or do you need them for spell components?
Andrew 26:23
Several uses for material components of a few spells.
Brian 26:28
I would say probably two silver worth for plants if you need them. She, she herself may not even know what they're used for. But what you hear from her is clearly you're looking for something very specific. She has it, so she says it would be two silver for what you asked for.
Andrew 26:45
Lorzatch will try to haggle.
Brian 26:48
Okay.
Andrew 26:49
And he fails. He hems and haws and is a little put out by the fact that he could pick this any place that he walked in the undercity but here we are and...
Brian 27:02
At the festival, where everything is probably marked up anyway.
Andrew 27:05
They crave money, these folks. He will spend two silver and purchase the wychwood and the sumac that he has asked for on the off chance that his totem is stolen.
Brian 27:16
Nice.
Andrew 27:17
Lorzatch will head back to the inn and do some repairs on his armor.
Ned 27:21
Yeah, back to the inn.
AD BREAK
Brian 27:22
So you now have a long rest. You can refill and recharge. The morning is considerably cruddy compared to the sunny festival weekend and you rise rather sluggishly, pack your things, put on your armor and head downstairs. On the first floor you can find Dodgy, who has not yet been to bed, still cleaning up from the celebration weekend. He gives you a sarcastic wave as he says goodbye to you hopefully for the last time. Immediately outside waiting for you is a group of six Boros legionnaires in full armor. Between them they have a stretcher where you can see a body lying on that stretcher. That is Elasia, who is under some sort of protective wrapping and she is currently comatose in a preservation spell to get her ready to go to the zonot.
There is the seventh member of the Boros. There is a young man who comes running up to you in perfect, pristine, all-white armor. He has a shield that is basically the size of him. But this young warrior himself is significantly shorter than anyone in the party and he just kind of runs up to you guys. ""Hi. Hi Fikarra.""
Sarah 28:31
""Hi.""
Brian 28:32
""Hi.""
Sarah 28:32
Who is this?
Brian 28:33
You don't know. But it is, but he seems to know you. This is a frontline medic. This is a, this is a soldier medic. He goes, ""Great."" He says, ""Have you guys been outfitted?""
Sarah 28:44
With?
Brian 28:44
""Oh,"" he goes, ""Glad I caught you."" He's surprisingly cheery for what you guys are going to do and he kind of pulls out his shield. And you can see behind his shield he has a bunch of collection of potions, scrolls, various things. He pulls out two common healing potions, hands them both to you and says, ""Standard issue. Here you go."" And he says, ""And also, here is one of these."" And he hands you a scroll. And from his back he pulls out a coil of rope. He says, ""As the captain always says, 'always carry rope.'"" And he hands you a coil of 50-foot rope. And he goes, ""We are ready to go when you guys are.""
Ned 29:24
'You and your fucking rope.'
Brian 29:27
We're ready when you are.
Sarah 29:28
Okay. And you said it was two common potions?
Brian 29:30
Yep.
Ned 29:31
And what was the scroll?
Brian 29:33
He goes, ""Oh, it's a scroll of stabilizing.""
Sarah 29:39
She just kind of pretends she knows what he's talking about.
Brian 29:43
Whatever sort of admiration he may have had for you from hearing the rumors of this weekend, you're kind of losing it by the moment as he's wondering if you were really a bad ass this weekend from the stories, or maybe you just kind of lucked into not dying. And he kind of looks you and he's like, ""It's a stabilizing scroll.""
Sarah 30:00
""Oh, right. Right.""
Andrew 30:02
""It's, ah, happens to be quite useful.""
Brian 30:04
""Wow.""
Andrew 30:04
""Thank you.""
Brian 30:07
""Yeah, again, we are ready to go when you guys are.""
Andrew 30:11
""Let's do be off.""
Sarah 30:12
""And, I'm sorry, what was your name?""
Brian 30:14
""Oh, you can call me Medic, because that's what you're going to be screaming when you need me. So...""
Sarah 30:19
But--
Brian 30:19
""Let's go!""
Ned 30:20
Well we do have to walk with you for a bit.
Brian 30:23
""Just call me Medic.""
Ned 30:24
Okay.
Sarah 30:25
Okay.
Eddie 30:27
""Onwards!""
Brian 30:28
Here we go.
Ned 30:28
Medic.
Brian 30:30
Sarah, would you please give me a Performance check on your drums to keep time and see how quickly you guys managed to get where you're supposed to go.
Sarah 30:38
You know, I'm not using this die anymore, though. I think you're retired for the moment. 13.
Brian 30:44
Okay. Nothing particularly stellar. But it gets you where you're going to go. The trip is long. It takes you most of the day and you left first thing in the morning. The thing to remember is, while it is the city of Ravnica, it is an entire realm of existence that is one city. You spend the day walking through many blocks, many streets, a couple of short alleyways, some tramways, some promenades, through a couple of gardens, as this sort of seemingly endless jungle of construction lays before you. Does anyone have any abilities that allow them to determine position or any sort of, like Ranger-esque survivability? Anybody who wishes to make a Survival check?
Andrew 31:30
Yeah. 9.
Brian 31:33
This is all very strange to you. It's above the ground. These are not tunnels. These are not turnways. Nothing really smells here. It's really just sort of this seemingly empty cavern of buildings. There's not very many people, almost as if people are very dedicatedly trying to stay away from the rail line as it's not really good for anything except the Boros. Everyone do please give me a Survival check for exhaustion.
Ned 32:03
14.
Andrew 32:05
24.
Sarah 32:08
1.
Eddie 32:08
15.
Brian 32:09
Everyone besides our Boros minotaur drummer. You have been drumming the entire day and your fellow soldiers don't really want to talk to you and Medic, who was pretty excited to see you in the morning among the rumors of you taking down a Rakdos circus, is even a little bit like, 'ah man, maybe this is not as awesome as I think it is.' You have acquired one level of exhaustion.
Sarah 32:35
Okay.
Brian 32:35
So with first level of exhaustion, you have disadvantage on ability checks.
Sarah 32:39
Okay.
Brian 32:40
Until you take a long rest and can recover a point.
Sarah 32:44
And you said long rest.
Brian 32:45
Yeah. Also, Fikarra's continued exhaustion slows you guys down just a little bit. The sun has begun to set below the skyline. The temperature change has shifted enough that a thick heavy fog has kind of rolled in, creeping from in between the buildings.
Andrew 33:03
Lorzatch is obviously more comfortable.
Brian 33:06
Great. The marching begins to fall out of time, the weariness of the day sets in, and though you haven't needed to help carry Elasia, you are still in full armor, you are still carrying all of your gear and the boredom of the day starts to plague your mind. And just when you think you can't stare at another facade, the streets of Ravnica open up into a very large plaza. Now the fog here is very thick within this plaza, so much so that you can't see the far end. But just as the sun begins to dip below the skyline, the fog parts just enough so that you can see sitting squarely in the middle of this plaza is a chunk of rail engine.
Ned 33:43
A chunk?
Brian 33:44
Yes, it is the engine itself and two rail cars attached to it, behind, and it is facing the direction where you came from.
Ned 33:53
It's not on the line?
Brian 33:55
It is on the line. You are following the line to the compound.
Eddie 33:58
Is it the missing Azorius engine?
Brian 34:02
Okay, please give me Investigation checks. You guys are just coming in in a straight line.
Eddie 34:06
15.
Andrew 34:08
8.
Brian 34:08
You're having a rough weekend, Boros.
Ned 34:11
Remind me how--
Sarah 34:12
Negative one.
Negative one.
Ned 34:14
Remind me how nat ones work here. I still get to add my bonus here? So I have a four.
Brian 34:18
You have a four. You know what, the fog is super thick. You guys can make out that this part of this engine line here. Perhaps you can even see the back of it. It could extend completely. Did anybody roll anything significant?
Eddie 34:31
I rolled a 15.
Brian 34:32
You rolled a 15. Great. And you're in front. So this works. So Lennox. You see this engine doesn't look to be a military vehicle. In fact, you can discern that because there is some sort of fancy calligraphy advertisement on the side of the front car. Now the cars themselves are pretty chewed up and scorched as if this engine has gone through a lot of damage. There are no windows that you can see of, but there are entrances that would suggest passengers getting on and off. Nothing would suggest any sort of military equipment, cable cars, anything designed to haul anything military. What you can make out on the very left side of the very front car is the remnants of whatever was written on there. And in bright yellow calligraphy you can see a capital M and a capital U. Everything beyond it is kind of scratched off or disrupted by fog.
Eddie 35:34
I walk up to the train.
Brian 35:35
Okay, what is everybody else doing?
Ned 35:37
Well, I think we're sort of feeling like the day is coming to an end. At some point we're gonna have to find lodging. If we're going to find lodging in a establishment of lodging, we should do that. If we're going to take cover somewhere, an empty train doesn't feel like a bad spot.
Andrew 35:53
Same.
Brian 35:53
Okay.
Ned 35:53
So I would head to the train to check the cars that could potentially house us for the night.
Andrew 35:59
Yeah, Lorzatch is going to follow Lennox.
Eddie 36:01
I enter the train.
Brian 36:02
You are approaching the train. Would you please make a Dexterity saving throw?
Eddie 36:06
Yes, sir.
Ned 36:08
That looks pretty great.
Eddie 36:10
19.
Brian 36:10
Great. You happen to reach the door at that exact moment when the sun finally dips completely below the skyline. And as you reach for the door, in that brief moment between when the plaza goes completely dark right before all the nighttime lamps alight, the door to the train car suddenly bursts open and a horde of feral humanoids start pouring out of this thing. And they aren't just pouring out into the plaza. They are crawling all over the train. And you see them start climbing up the walls of the city of Ravnica and into the windows. And suddenly the nighttime air is filled with the scream of citizens that are being set upon by these feral creatures. Now you manage to dodge the initial bursting open up this door. But it is fight time. So would everyone please roll initiative. Let's roll initiative!
Ned 37:02
Do we get the six Boros guys, are they fighting on our behalf here?
Andrew 37:09
21.
Eddie 37:10
10.
Ned 37:11
11.
Sarah 37:12
8.
Brian 37:12
8. It's not horrible.
Sarah 37:14
I know.
Brian 37:15
It's just low. But thank you, Sarah. So what you see are a couple of things. So these feral creatures pour out of this train and immediately set upon you and your companions, the Boros legionnaires and Medic are immediately tossed into the fray. But as these things swarm all over you, you start to notice a couple of actually really disturbing characteristics. For example, one of them has this horrid mark on its face that looks like a handprint that was burned into his face as if by acid and another one happens to have a much smaller mark on his nose as if a bit of acid dropped onto his nose and you start to realize based on their outfits that these are the group of men who came into the Leg End to capture that mongrel from the very beginning.
Ned 38:02
Oh, not the Skyx crew.
Brian 38:04
No. And right behind them, coming out of the train, lastly, probably because of his size, is the towering frame of Gato, except he is turned by something--razor sharp teeth, blank eyes as he comes sauntering out with a feral animosity. And behind him he's dragging that big metal arm of his, unable to sort of coordinate it with the strength the had back at the Leg End.
Andrew 38:34
Would Lorzatch recognize this behavior as any kind of naturally occurring rabies or the result of any kind of infection?
Brian 38:42
Give me an Insight check. Or Nature.
Andrew 38:45
8.
Brian 38:46
No. But you are up first so what would you like to do?
Andrew 38:52
Lorzatch is going to awaken the spores in his body.
Brian 38:55
Awaken the spores in his body.
Ned 38:58
Who's up next?
Brian 38:58
They are up next. So, Lorzatch?
Andrew 39:01
Yep.
Brian 39:02
And Lennox, would you please make a Constitution saving throw?
Andrew 39:07
This is coming from which character?
Brian 39:09
All of them.
Eddie 39:10
17.
Brian 39:11
You are within range of something. It is, it is a saving throw. 17.
Andrew 39:16
Constitution? 17 also.
Brian 39:17
Great. So you both are safe, but you can see this sort of horrid gas emanating out from these creatures as if their insides are dissipating into smoke and it is noxious. Now there are two of them near to you, Lennox, the one behind you can see your vulnerability and it's going to come at you. And then the other one, seeing that you are now entangled, is going to bee-line for Brevin in the back line.
Ned 39:43
Great.
Brian 39:46
And they are going to make an attack, so, Ned, you are being attacked.
Natural 20.
Ned 39:59
Yeah, that'll hit.
Brian 39:59
I need you to make a Constitution saving throw.
Ned 40:02
Constitution saving throw.
Brian 40:03
Please. And it is a critical hit.
Ned 40:06
24.
Brian 40:07
Oh that's actually really good. That's really good. But you are going to take 19 slashing damage.
Eddie 40:15
Ooh.
Ned 40:15
Sure.
Brian 40:16
Are we still up?
Ned 40:17
I'm still up.
Brian 40:18
Still up.
Andrew 40:18
Hot damn.
Ned 40:19
I mean, it's not a great thing but I'm still up.
Brian 40:21
Lennox, you are also being attacked as it takes a swipe at you. It rolls a 22.
Eddie 40:31
""Agh!""
Brian 40:34
Is that code for 'yes I've been hit?'
Eddie 40:35
Yes.
Brian 40:38
You are going to take 8 slashing damage and would you please make a Constitution saving throw?
Eddie 40:45
That is an eight.
Brian 40:46
You find yourself instantly paralyzed.
Eddie 40:50
Oh fuck.
Brian 40:52
At the end of your turns you may attempt another saving throw to remove this effect, but as of right now you are full on paralysis.
Eddie 41:00
And that was 8 damage?
Brian 41:02
8 slashing damage, yes. So, about paralysis, keep in mind you automatically fail Strength and Dex saves, attack rolls against you have advantage, and if you are within five feet of the attack, it's an automatic crit. For those of you at home to remember. Brevin, your turn is up.
Ned 41:19
Okay. So just a quick order of operations rule.
Brian 41:22
Yes.
Ned 41:23
I can do my things and then move, right?
Brian 41:25
You can split your move between any which way you want.
Ned 41:28
Copy. If I can pass this guy
Brian 41:30
You can take an action, move
Ned 41:31
I'm gonna get an opportunity but I can do it.
Brian 41:33
You can. So you can move, take an action, move, bonus action, move as long as you keep within your 30.
Ned 41:39
Right, yeah, and Fikarra?
Sarah 41:41
Yeah?
Ned 41:42
What is your total health? If I leave you alone with this guy are you going to be in trouble?
Sarah 41:45
I'm at 18.
Ned 41:46
Great. So then first thing I'm going to do is actually take my bonus action and do, act, Second Wind to get some health back.
Brian 41:53
Great.
Ned 41:53
I'm coming to you. Feels like you're more likely to get fucked up by this guy than she is by the other guy. As the one with no armor class. No?
Andrew 42:00
Nah.
Ned 42:01
Okay, well then maybe I'll change that plan.
Brian 42:03
There's a great deal of mystery surrounding Lorzatch right now.
Ned 42:07
Yeah for sure. I'm trying to figure out who I should be protecting.
Brian 42:10
There's a very strange undercity Devkarin elf that's just sort of wandering around upstairs.
Eddie 42:13
I'm paralyzed right now.
Ned 42:14
You're kind of a lost cause. I cannot get to you.
Brian 42:20
No, that is, that is troubling.
Ned 42:22
I would protect you if I could, but I can't so I have to protect someone else. So I guess I'll protect her if I don't have to protect Lorzatch.
Sarah 42:28
At the same time, last combat, I did cast Thunderwave.
Andrew 42:32
I won't say no to your help.
Ned 42:34
So first I'm going to take Second Wind and let's see how that goes. That would be 12 full points of health back.
Brian 42:43
Great.
Ned 42:44
Which is useful. And then I'm going to disengage.
Brian 42:46
I usually roll a one, so that's great.
Ned 42:48
Yeah, that's about right. I'm going to disengage to get out of this asshole's face and I'm going to take my full move to Lorzatch.
Brian 42:57
Okay, so you are now face to face with--
Ned 43:00
With Gato.
Brian 43:01
Whatever used to be Gato.
Ned 43:03
Right. And I'm going to attack.
Brian 43:04
Great.
Ned 43:05
Longsword.
Brian 43:05
Please do.
Ned 43:06
Great. With Action Surge for those listening at home.
Brian 43:09
Yes.
Ned 43:10
It is a 20, non-natural.
Brian 43:12
A 20 will hit. Please roll damage.
Ned 43:14
Yep. Six.
Brian 43:16
Great. Good to know. Thank you very much.
Ned 43:17
Yep.
Brian 43:18
Okay. It is now his turn.
Andrew 43:21
He may make a Constitution saving throw.
Brian 43:23
He may make a Constitution saving throw. He will. He rolls an 8.
Andrew 43:28
He takes 3 necrotic damage.
Brian 43:30
He takes 3 necrotic damage. You very quickly probably notice know necrotic damage doesn't affect them quite as much as you're hoping it would affect them. He is going to make... So how does this work? Describe how this necrotic damage...
Andrew 43:44
The air surrounding--
Brian 43:46
Is it your spores?
Andrew 43:47
It's the spores.
Brian 43:48
Okay, so please continue because I'm trying to decide how he's going to react to this.
Andrew 43:52
Yeah, the awakened spores drift slowly towards what used to be Gato, and crawl into his nostrils.
Brian 43:59
So he would know that this definitely came from you when he stares back at you with this feral animosity and this deep growl of this [deep growl]
So he's going to make a multi-attack. He's going to swing his big arm in kind of a weird figure-eight to try and hit you and also hit Ned.
Ned 44:19
I'm using Protection, so disadvantage on him.
Brian 44:21
Great. This is so easy to do with dice. I got this. Okay, so the first attack will be on Lorzatch and he will roll a 8.
Andrew 44:30
Fails.
Brian 44:31
Which is probably way under, and then Ned, he is going to attack you and is going to roll an 11.
Ned 44:37
Fails.
Brian 44:38
Okay, so there is clearly no sense of consciousness or clarity here, okay? Gato is just swinging this arm around from the shoulder with no understanding of how it even functions. He's not even trying to use like the grappling mechanism of any of that he's just [deep growl] Just trying to whack on whatever's in range. Lennox, you are currently paralyzed.
Eddie 45:00
I'm going to try to fix that by rolling this d20.
Brian 45:03
Constitution saving throw please.
Ned 45:04
I believe in you.
Brian 45:07
Congratulations, you are not paralyzed. Fikarra.
Sarah 45:11
Yes.
Brian 45:13
Do your thing.
Sarah 45:14
Okay, your, who's first on the list thing? Was it Lorzatch, or was it...?
Ned 45:18
Lorzatch is first.
Andrew 45:19
At the top of the initiative, yeah, that's me.
Sarah 45:20
Okay. Um, because I'm bottom of the order. So I'll give you the Bardic Inspiration.
Ned 45:25
So it's immediately useful. Yeah.
Sarah 45:27
Right. Bardic Inspiration for you. And then I'm going to do Thunderwave on the dude in front of me. So that's going to be a Constitution saving throw for them.
Brian 45:37
Great. So Lorzatch, you are inspired.
Andrew 45:40
Thanks.
Sarah 45:41
You're welcome.
Brian 45:42
All right. What is the target number for Thunderwave?
Sarah 45:45
That is going to be...
Brian 45:48
8 plus your... whatever your spell casting modifier is.
Sarah 45:51
Right, so 13.
Brian 45:52
13. He rolls a three with a thud if you heard that on the microphone. It just kind of went [thump]. So it gets pushed back 10 feet.
Ned 46:02
By us now.
Sarah 46:03
Yeah, and then takes 2d8 of thunder.
Brian 46:06
Go and roll.
Andrew 46:07
Sorry, where? Where does he move?
Ned 46:09
Straight backwards.
Andrew 46:10
Guess what he needs to do, right now?
Brian 46:12
Is it a 10 foot range? When he enters your space or begins to the turn in your space?
Andrew 46:16
Yep.
Brian 46:17
Alright.
Ned 46:17
Does it affect me?
Andrew 46:17
No.
Brian 46:18
Do it.
Ned 46:18
That's useful.
Sarah 46:22
And he takes 10 damage.
Brian 46:23
He takes 10 damage. Thank you so very much.
Sarah 46:25
Now he's away from me and I can charge him if I need to.
Brian 46:28
And he takes?
Andrew 46:28
6 necrotic damage.
Brian 46:29
6 necrotic damage. Again, not quite as potent as you normally see it. Great. So, back, top of the order, don't die, Lorzatch, you are now up.
Ned 46:40
Get them baby.
Brian 46:41
Do you have a whirlwind attack?
Ned 46:42
Yes it's called spores and a 10-foot radius.
Brian 46:47
So you have the big guy in front of you, but then you can also feel that your spores did something behind you as the danger slowly closes in.
Andrew 46:54
And Lorzatch will approach what used to be Mr. Gato AKA the Mustache Man and attack in the following manner.
Brian 47:04
That looks like, that looks like a big whiff.
Andrew 47:06
They are both quite bad.
Brian 47:11
Are these your daggers?
Andrew 47:12
And a scimitar, yes.
Brian 47:13
Yes, so with with a bit of an overconfident swing, we misjudge the distance in the dark and [swish swish] failed to connect into the dark. It is now the two smaller feral creatures' turn. Eddie, the one next to you is going to attack you again.
It is going to roll a 6 to hit you, which I imagine won't do anything.
Eddie 47:38
Bounces off my shield.
Brian 47:40
The one that got pushed away by Fikarra is actually going to run back to her.
Ned 47:45
Going to Fikarra?
Brian 47:46
And attack her.
Andrew 47:47
But it starts its turn there?
Brian 47:48
It starts to turn in your thing, so do your spores.
Andrew 47:51
Please make a Constitution saving throw.
Brian 47:54
It rolls a, an 8.
Andrew 47:57
It takes 4 necrotic damage.
Brian 48:00
Okay, so this creature, after taking a bit of a stun from the spores, kind of realizes that you did something it doesn't enjoy and comes raging at you, flailing its claws around violently with no real strategy, it just looks dead set on trying to tear you apart with its hands. And it will make an attack roll and it rolled a 13.
Sarah 48:24
No.
Brian 48:24
13 does not hit. You guys are all like wearing armor, aren't you? Great.
Sarah 48:28
Yeah.
Brian 48:30
Making a note for further encounters, audience.
Ned 48:32
Armor and shield.
Brian 48:33
Great.
Sarah 48:34
And that's how we had a TPK.
Brian 48:36
Yes, falling rocks, everybody. Okay. Ned. Brevin is up.
Ned 48:41
Okay, so, Brevin's very simply going to, you know, he's been protecting with his shield, he's making sure Lorzatch is okay, now he's going to rear back, take this sword and attempt to come down on the neck of what used to be Mr. Gato.
Brian 48:53
Great. I mean not great. I hope it doesn't work.
Ned 48:56
A 12?
Brian 48:56
12 does not hit.
Ned 48:57
Okay.
Brian 48:57
Very resilient monster of man. And it is now his turn and he will attempt to return in kind.
Andrew 49:04
And he will take a Constitution saving throw.
Brian 49:06
And he will make a Constitution saving throw.
Ned 49:09
For those listening at home, I really like Lorzatch.
Brian 49:10
A 19.
Andrew 49:11
He saves.
Brian 49:15
He is quite large and has a great deal of Constitution. But the way I'm rolling is making this battle slightly easier than--
Sarah 49:21
Oh, the way you're rolling?
Brian 49:23
You're exhausted.
Sarah 49:24
Let's have a talk about this.
Brian 49:26
So, Ned, he is going to swing at you with a 20.
Ned 49:29
Yeah.
Brian 49:30
Great. So he is still kind of flailing around but he manages to kind of zone in on you for a brief moment and brings his big arm down in an arc over the top of your shield.
Andrew 49:42
Like a windmill in a mosh pit.
Sarah 49:44
I'm picturing him as Mongo.
Andrew 49:45
These are the days of our lives.
Brian 49:46
Yes, you are going to take 9 bludgeoning damage.
Ned 49:49
Copy.
Brian 49:50
Lennox.
Ned 49:50
I am down to six.
Brian 49:52
Great.
Ned 49:52
For the table's knowledge.
Brian 49:54
Lennox, you are now back in the fray.
Ned 49:58
I'm so glad to have you.
Eddie 49:59
Here's what I'm going to do.
Ned 50:01
I like to imagine that Lennox says this as he goes.
Eddie 50:04
With my bonus action.
Brian 50:06
Yes.
Eddie 50:07
I will cast Shield of Faith on my companion. I will use my voice of authority, granting him an extra attack.
Brian 50:15
Great.
Ned 50:15
Oh sexy.
Brian 50:16
At this exact moment?
Eddie 50:17
At this exact moment.
Brian 50:18
Make an attack roll.
Andrew 50:19
Yeah.
Brian 50:19
Just a basic attack roll.
Ned 50:21
It's not great. It's an 8.
Brian 50:22
An 8 will not work. You have wasted your opportunity.
Eddie 50:25
I need help from both ends here. Okay?
Ned 50:30
That's what she said.
Eddie 50:31
And now I will attack.
Brian 50:32
Yes please.
Eddie 50:33
The creature in front of me. With my mace.
Brian 50:36
Yes, that is enough. That's, that's a natural 19. Yeah, you're good. Natural 19. Please roll damage.
Eddie 50:44
So that is six points of damage.
Brian 50:46
What type of damage?
Eddie 50:48
It's bludgeon, bludgeoning.
Brian 50:49
Bludgeoning damage.
Eddie 50:50
It's a mace.
Brian 50:50
Okay.
Eddie 50:51
Question also.
Brian 50:52
Yes.
Eddie 50:52
Can I tell if rather or not these are undead creatures?
Brian 50:57
Make an Insight check please.
Eddie 51:00
That is 20.
Brian 51:01
They are alive.
Eddie 51:03
Okay.
Brian 51:04
We'll say they are not undead.
Eddie 51:06
Thank you.
Brian 51:06
You are welcome. Fikarra. End of round two. You're up once again.
Sarah 51:12
Hooray! Anybody want the Bardic Inspiration?
Andrew 51:15
I still have mine. I haven't used it.
Sarah 51:16
Okay, cool. So that means I can't cast it again? No. I can. Yeah.
Brian 51:20
You can.
Sarah 51:21
Right. Okay.
Ned 51:21
I will happily take it.
Sarah 51:22
Yeah, I'll do, I'll Bardic Inspiration on Ned.
Brian 51:26
Great.
Sarah 51:26
And then just go straight for the face with the mace to the guy in front of you, like that is going to be a 23.
Brian 51:34
Yes. Do it. A 23 is pretty good to hit.
Ned 51:39
I like when, I like when Brian gets excited about things. 'Yes. Do it.'
Eddie 51:43
You have +2 to your Armor Class now.
Sarah 51:45
That is going to be a seven.
Eddie 51:46
Yeah.
Ned 51:47
Copy.
Eddie 51:47
From my Shield of Faith.
Brian 51:48
A seven?
Sarah 51:48
Yes.
Brian 51:49
Great. Seven damage. Can we, yes, we already talked about this. It is stackable effect on you, Ned.
Ned 51:56
Okay.
Brian 51:56
Okay, top of the order.
Ned 51:57
I figured out how to do it. You click armor. Okay. Lorzatch.
Brian 52:01
Again, using the skills of D&D Beyond, we're looking for a sponsor.
Ned 52:04
Yeah. Wizards of the Coast, what up?
Andrew 52:06
Lorzatch will swing and he will hit with, maybe, with 22.
Brian 52:13
22 will hit.
Andrew 52:15
And he will...
Brian 52:16
What are you doing?
Andrew 52:17
A slash with his scimitar.
Brian 52:19
A slash with his scimitar.
Andrew 52:22
Using Bardic Inspiration for damage...
Brian 52:25
Oh, hello.
Andrew 52:27
And 13 damage.
Brian 52:29
Yes.
Andrew 52:30
Six of that is poison.
Brian 52:32
Strange thing about poison: doesn't seem to affect him at all. Hello everyone, your Dungeon Master here. I realized in the heat of combat that I have missed Andrew using Bardic Inspiration for his damage dice, a rehash of the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. The bardic spell Bardic Inspiration cannot be used for damage dice. Thank you. You kind of spin wildly with the knife, don't manage to connect, but the feint allows you the opening for the scimitar to come in and make a devastating slash across his stomach. Physically, it's taking a great deal of damage but mentally these things are gone. And no matter how much you attack them, they seem dead set to just come at you with every sense of aggression they possibly can muster. They are nothing like the weaklings you met three days ago.
Andrew 53:19
And as a bonus action I'm going to cast Healing Word on Brevin.
Ned 53:23
Appreciate you.
Andrew 53:24
And Brevin will gain 6 hit points.
Ned 53:26
Thanks.
Brian 53:27
Awesome. The two raging humanoids are going to continue attacking Fikarra and Lennox. [snarling]
Fikarra, you have received a natural 20, so at 24, and Eddie, you have received a 7.
Sarah 53:45
I roll to disbelieve.
Brian 53:48
Well, I can show it, I can show it to you.
Sarah 53:51
I am pouting.
Brian 53:53
Yes. So Fikarra, I need you to make a Constitution saving throw.
Sarah 53:57
Okay.
Brian 53:58
And you are going to take 17 slashing damage. And would you please make a Constitution saving throw?
Sarah 54:06
I got a 12.
Brian 54:09
A 12. You are currently safe from paralysis. But you did take a healthy bit of slashing.
Ned 54:13
A healthy chunk of crap.
Brian 54:15
Yes.
Sarah 54:16
Okay.
Brian 54:16
These are rather dangerous. They look kind of mindless but there is a wild abandon to them, much different than the sort of poise and easy knock back from when you first saw them. Something has clearly happened in the last two days to these people. Brevin, you are up.
Ned 54:32
So I am going to utilize my Bardic Inspiration on an attack.
Brian 54:37
Yes.
Ned 54:38
On Mr. Mustachio, the Gato, for everyone back home.
Brian 54:42
Yes.
Ned 54:42
And I will be using--
Brian 54:43
The large, metal-armed, mustachioed man.
Ned 54:45
Yes.
Brian 54:46
That's alliteration.
Ned 54:47
I am going to use my long sword in an attempt to... I would like to stab straight through the throat to see if that has effect on these creatures that are living but not.
Brian 54:57
Sure.
Ned 54:58
Oh, hey, that--
Brian 55:00
Called shots aren't thing.
Ned 55:02
That's true, was my attempt. I'm attacking the head. It's a 14.
Brian 55:06
It's a 14. A 14 does not connect.
Ned 55:08
Can I add Bardic Inspiration to an attack roll?
Andrew 55:10
Yes.
Brian 55:10
Yes.
Ned 55:11
Great. Then that's exactly what I'm going to do.
Brian 55:13
Go ahead.
Ned 55:13
It's a 15.
Brian 55:15
A 15 does not--
Ned 55:16
Damn it!
Brian 55:17
So you come straight at him with a piercing motion with the sword and in all his flailing, he really just kind of seems to be able to step back slightly enough to just have the strike miss home. It is his turn though. And he will use that momentum to-- yes?
Andrew 55:31
Take a Constitution saving throw.
Brian 55:32
He begins his turn affected by some spores. He gets a 17.
Andrew 55:37
He saves.
Brian 55:38
He takes a step back to kind of use that momentum but windmills his arm again to try and come down on top of you. And will roll a 19.
Ned 55:47
No.
Brian 55:48
No?
Ned 55:49
I'm being healed by that, I'm at--
Brian 55:50
Bugger.
Ned 55:51
I'm at a 20 Armor Class.
Brian 55:52
Good. Good to know. Shit.
Eddie 55:55
Take a step back.
Brian 55:56
Yes. So, Lennox, you are up.
Eddie 55:58
I'm going to try and crush this creature's skull with my mace.
Brian 56:02
Soulless machine.
Andrew 56:08
That's a critical hit.
Brian 56:09
That is a critical hit.
Eddie 56:11
8 points of damage.
Brian 56:12
8 points of damage. Yeah, you smash them up pretty good. Your mace strikes true.
Eddie 56:19
""Haha!""
Brian 56:19
Fikarra, please go.
Sarah 56:20
So I, can I touch myself and cast Healing Wounds?
Brian 56:24
Phrasing.
Sarah 56:24
Yep.
Brian 56:26
You may. Any creature you can touch. You may.
Sarah 56:29
Okay.
Brian 56:30
It's un-intuitive, but you can Cure Wounds on yourself.
Sarah 56:32
Alright. So Fikarra is just going to take a knee for a second because she is beat the fuck up right now.
Brian 56:38
What is the duration of the spell?
Sarah 56:40
The duration of the spell?
Brian 56:41
Yes.
Sarah 56:42
It's instantaneous.
Brian 56:43
Great.
Sarah 56:44
So I will kind of take a knee like, 'all right, that's how we're gonna play this game. I'ma, give me a second.' So I'll heal wounds on myself. So that's three, or 1d8+3.
Brian 56:55
1d8 plus your modifier.
Sarah 56:57
Oh, yay. So that's 11.
Brian 57:00
Are you guys having like perfect healing rolls today?
Sarah 57:02
Yeah, I rolled an 8.
Brian 57:03
I'm gonna try harder to kill you for the sake of our audience's entertainment. Listeners at home: I promise this is going to get a lot more dangerous.
Sarah 57:11
And then I'll just, who, you haven't had Bardic Inspiration yet, right?
Ned 57:15
Lennox's turn.
Sarah 57:16
Lennox.
Brian 57:16
Everybody has also already used theirs. So you can...
Ned 57:18
That's true.
Sarah 57:19
Have they?
Ned 57:19
You can hit anybody now.
Brian 57:20
Yes, you can give it back to anyone.
Sarah 57:21
Oh right.
Brian 57:22
Yep. Last round both Ned and Andrew used theirs.
Sarah 57:24
Okay. I love your face. But they're in front of the big guy with the hand.
Eddie 57:28
They have the big scary guy.
Ned 57:30
He goes first.
Sarah 57:30
I'm going to give you Bardic Inspiration again, Lorzatch.
Andrew 57:33
Copy.
Sarah 57:33
Yeah, that's my turn.
Brian 57:34
Great. Top of the order. Lorzatch.
Andrew 57:36
Feeling that hot rhythm, Lorzatch is inspired. And moves forward to slash what used to be Mr. Gato.
Sarah 57:46
Oh yeah.
Andrew 57:46
With both his dagger and his scimitar. A 21.
Brian 57:52
For which?
Andrew 57:53
For the scimitar.
Brian 57:54
For this scimitar.
Andrew 57:56
And an 11 for the dagger.
Brian 57:58
So the scimitar, yes, the dagger, no.
Andrew 58:03
That was Bardic Inspiration and it did nothing.
Brian 58:05
Great.
Sarah 58:06
I'm a helper.
Andrew 58:12
And he will take 8 damage, 1 poison damage.
Brian 58:15
8 damage and an additional poison damage?
Andrew 58:18
Correct.
Brian 58:19
Again, a massive strike that you're kind of surprised didn't end it right there. But it might be the fact that the poison just isn't effective enough. It is now the two minor ones' turns. They are going to attack, again, both Fikarra and Lennox, who they're trying desperately to destroy. Lennox is a absolute fail and Fikarra will be a 14.
Sarah 58:44
No.
Brian 58:45
So we're getting a little bit better at avoiding this sort of wild danger. Brevin, you're up.
Ned 58:50
I'm going to continue with my same action of just trying to fell this massive mustachioed man.
Brian 58:55
It looks like it might not take very much left.
Ned 58:57
Great. How does an 11 do?
Brian 59:00
An 11 will not connect.
Ned 59:02
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Brian 59:03
He will do the same thing. He's sort of rope-a-doping with you.
Andrew 59:06
And...
Brian 59:06
But you are the one in his face and he is starting his turn there and will take possibly some spore damage. He rolls a 12.
Andrew 59:13
And he will take two necrotic damage.
Brian 59:17
So you just keep bringing the punishment, right, you're just swinging these swords, slashing, slashing, trying to take down this massive feral Gato. And his wild abandon is allowing him to kind of dodge these attacks and, and take them in a non-lethal manner as he's just sort of bobbing and swinging back and forth. And you reach a point where you kind of slash open and realize, 'holy crap, I've just left myself open.' And you can see Gato windmill back to bring this metal arm on top of you. And as you can visualize yourself about to get domed in the head, suddenly he takes this big intake of breath and the spores creep inside of him and before he gets a chance to swing that metal arm, he chokes with this [groaning, wheezing] as he just collapses down to the ground in front of you. Lennox. You still have two have these things on you. By now you have also heard the screams and the horror as people are being dragged out from their windows by these things and sort of disappearing into the night.
Ned 1:00:23
How's our Boros team doing?
Brian 1:00:24
Your Boros team is being completely overwhelmed.
Ned 1:00:28
'Kay.
Brian 1:00:28
In a horrifying way.
Ned 1:00:29
So we should get to them very fast.
Brian 1:00:30
You are unfortunately too engage with what you have now to be able to reach them.
Eddie 1:00:34
I try to dispatch this monstrosity in front of me.
Brian 1:00:37
Do it.
Eddie 1:00:38
19.
Brian 1:00:38
A 19 definitely hits. Still a mace swing?
Eddie 1:00:42
Yes. 8 points of damage.
Brian 1:00:44
Ah, exactly what you needed. So how does this happen?
Eddie 1:00:48
I turn its head into powder with my mace.
Brian 1:00:52
Yes, so, with a mighty swing of your mace--
Eddie 1:00:54
Into mush.
Brian 1:00:55
Into mush. You dome this thing in the face.
Eddie 1:00:58
Yes.
Brian 1:00:59
Turning whatever used to be human into putty. Fikarra, one left.
Sarah 1:01:03
'Boom boom motherfucker,' and just--boom!--both sides with both maces, just smoosh.
Brian 1:01:13
'Boom boom motherfucker.'
Ned 1:01:15
The title of this episode.
Sarah 1:01:18
Like a 20-something.
Brian 1:01:19
Yes.
Sarah 1:01:20
And then a... 11.
Brian 1:01:23
No.
Sarah 1:01:23
Okay, to hit. Alright, so just one of them.
Brian 1:01:26
Yes.
Ned 1:01:27
It's just 'boom, motherfucker.'
Sarah 1:01:28
Yeah.
Brian 1:01:28
Just a singular boom.
Sarah 1:01:30
That is going to be 7 damage.
Brian 1:01:32
How does it happen?
Sarah 1:01:33
I kind of don't really hit with one of them more than kind of control the splatter that happens when the the left one comes up and the right one's just kind of like, 'nope, not there, that way. Okay, good. Bam!' And it just like explodes this guy's head in a manner that would make Tarantino quite impressed.
Brian 1:01:52
Good. You're now covered in blood. As the, as the screams continue to echo off into the night as whatever was in this rail car has now fled, taking victims this way and that, you manage to finally collect yourselves in a minute to turn around and realize that your escort of Boros soldiers are either dead or missing. The young man in white armor is missing his throat.
Sarah 1:02:21
Oh.
Brian 1:02:21
Lying on the ground. His once-pristine white armor of the medic is now covered in splatter red.
Ned 1:02:28
'Medic!'
Brian 1:02:30
He told you that's what you would be screaming.
Eddie 1:02:33
Is he's he's he's he's mega dead, huh?
Brian 1:02:36
He's very, very dead. However--
Ned 1:02:38
That stabilization scroll couldn't... save him?
Brian 1:02:41
However. However, Elasia is completely untouched and still wrapped in her protective case.
Sarah 1:02:50
Okay, um, as a sign of respect to the medic, I'm going to just kind of, you know, close his eyes, fold his hands over his chest to kind of give at least a little bit of, you know, comfort to the dead before I double check to see if there's anything behind his shield that we can take.
Brian 1:03:07
Roll an Investigation, please.
Sarah 1:03:08
Oh, anybody else want to look? Because...
Eddie 1:03:10
Sure, I'll search his body.
Sarah 1:03:12
Yeah, I will suggest it to everyone else because I'm bad at looking. And I can't, I just can't.
Eddie 1:03:16
17.
Brian 1:03:17
17.
Ned 1:03:18
8.
Brian 1:03:19
8.
Andrew 1:03:20
Investigation?
Brian 1:03:21
Yeah.
Andrew 1:03:22
14.
Brian 1:03:22
Okay, Eddie, you probably know enough about some of these things to kind of pick maybe what's useful and what's not. Most of the vials are shattered, and almost all of the scrolls are just sort of torn. But you do manage to find a small vial of a stark white potion. Could you please give me an Arcana check or, anyone, give me an Arcana check?
Eddie 1:03:45
Someone else should probably do the honors.
Brian 1:03:47
If you choose to reveal that you have found it?
Eddie 1:03:49
Oh, yes, I reveal.
Brian 1:03:50
Yeah.
Ned 1:03:50
17.
Brian 1:03:51
17. It is some sort of defensive boosting potion. You will receive +2 to your AC for an hour after consuming.
Andrew 1:04:01
Lorzatch is going to examine the bodies of the afflicted beings they just dispatched.
Brian 1:04:09
So you notice that these people, who are still people, have somehow, their teeth have sort of grown wilder and their hands have developed claws and they have some sort of extra musculature that seems to have just sort of spread from anywhere, but there's a severe lack of consciousness in their eyes. It was some sort of strange, pure feral transformation, not one that you would expect to be done willingly, considering the nature of what it does to you. Their skin has turned a little bit more gray. Their veins are just a little bit more prominent, almost rabid but clearly not rabies.
Eddie 1:04:47
I, you know, just because, I check all of the other people to make sure they're dead. All of our--
Brian 1:04:54
They are all dead or they are gone.
Andrew 1:04:57
Lorzatch will examine the train.
Ned 1:04:59
Yeah.
Andrew 1:04:59
Especially whatever is scrawled on the side of the train. We got M and U before the door burst open.
Brian 1:05:06
Yes.
Andrew 1:05:07
Is there any other writing we can perceive?
Brian 1:05:09
There is. As you circle the engine and it's cars, you realize that the other side of the train, which you never really managed to get to in combat, looks very much like the left side that you approach. There is some sort of massive scorching from the back end of the car that mirrors what you saw on the other side, but given the writing of left to right you do make out the end of some of the calligraphy at the far right of the first car on the other side, and you manage to make out, in gorgeous yellow calligraphy, what looks to be the end of a word, the letters E and R.
Ned 1:05:45
So we have M, U, something, E, R.
Brian 1:05:47
Inside the cars is absolutely destroyed. But what you see is something that was luxurious, there are carpets on the floor. There are also display cases, everywhere. All of the display cases are shattered, everything that was once hanging up on the walls has been torn out of their frames, smashed glasses everywhere, bookcases, which could have hold any sort of things, are tumbled over. It looks completely ransacked of anything that have cost, possibly could have been in here.
Andrew 1:06:21
Are there any guild insignias on display? Is there anything to suggest that this was a military transport?
Brian 1:06:28
There is no insignia whatsoever. It looks like some sort of showcase.
Sarah 1:06:34
Would I have known what this last transport was called, or anything about it?
Brian 1:06:39
The, the Boros lines were strictly military vehicle.
Sarah 1:06:44
Oh.
Ned 1:06:44
So this feels not Boros-y.
Brian 1:06:45
They would be, they would be designed purely for transporting soldiers and military equipment. Like a military caravan.
Ned 1:06:53
This would feel like a train that's not military, on a military line.
Brian 1:06:57
Correct.
Andrew 1:06:58
And given--
Brian 1:06:58
Pointed away from where you are going.
Andrew 1:07:01
Given who spilled out of the train, is there a chance that this is the personal transport of one Mr. Alfonso?
Ned 1:07:08
I was thinking something very similar.
Brian 1:07:10
Anything else you guys would like to investigate about the engine?
Andrew 1:07:12
What happened to the, the main engine?
Ned 1:07:15
What caused the scorching and the...?
Brian 1:07:18
Does anybody have any sort of scientific background?
Ned 1:07:22
No.
Andrew 1:07:22
Sort of.
Brian 1:07:23
You can try. As far as the scorching, there is no structural damage to the train car. Okay, so whatever has marred the surface suggests that something happened around the train, not necessarily to the train or inside the train itself. However, as you circle around back you noticed that the small bits at the base of the cable cars that would connect it to the car behind them has been, it looks sort of like it was shaved off. Right, like it was installed there to begin with. But somebody kind of very cleanly came by and just clipped it off. So perhaps this isn't the back end of the train. But for whatever reason the back end of the train was removed. But the day is long, and the night has set in. And after an exhausting fight, you've lost several of your Boros escorts. The young medic lies dead at your feet. And you still have not made your way to the Simic zonot. In fact, you are left with nothing more than the comatose body of Elasia, and you find perhaps the best thing to do to battle your ensuing exhaustion is to bunker inside of this destroyed train for the night. And as the darkness creeps in, and the silence takes hold as the sound of screaming civilians dissipates out into the foggy night, you wonder what exactly is coming up ahead with this Simic Combine. But, for now, you have a train.
On the next Encounter Party! The mystery of Malphus Reed looms overhead as our players make peace with the Simic Combine. Can they discover what Elasia has learned? What perils await them in the Simic compound? And whatever happened to their companion Zenia? Find out on the next Encounter Party!

Last time on Encounter Party, what began as a mutual punishment turn to terror as a grizzly murder sours the Guildpact festival. Left unsolved, this heinous crime could ruin our players' agreement with the Boros captain. Can they stop the culprit in time? Or will they celebrate the new year in jail? Find out this week on Encounter Party!
As you wearily climb out of bed, you rise to the stirring of the city. Golden sunlight bathes the city in warmth, all none the wiser that such a horrific crime occurred mere hours ago. The new year brings a freshness to the air, one you all would enjoy if not for the sour aftertaste in your mouths. As you don your garments and armor, the Boros sigil flare like manacles over your heart, tethering you once again to the task at hand. Day two brings even more fervor as you notice the more impressive attractions were saved for the back half of the festival. As you shuffle out into the street, would someone please roll me a D6. Ah, you roll a four. Okay, so the first thing you notice as you step out is there's a parade. Early in the morning several guilds have gotten together to celebrate the Third District part of Ravnica. What you see in the front, leading the charge, are a couple of Rakdos performers like some fire dancers, some knife jugglers, some people doing some acrobatics, sort of clearing the crowd, making sure that the procession can move down smoothly. There is a Boros military drumline as part of the parade, one that Fikarra, you're now realizing you've been left out of. There are some Izzet League members who are shooting off some sort of exciting pyrotechnic displays like homemade fireworks and stuff like that. In a little ways down towards the middle of the procession is a large alms-beast, which is an Orzhov beast of burden. It's difficult to kind of explain Orzhov creatures because they have very, sort of, the almost decayed look, gray skin, like they could be dead, or maybe they were dead and they were resurrected.
Andrew 2:14
Ah. Thrulls.
Brian 2:17
But in beast form. It's like a kind of grotesque dinosaur homonculus, if that imagery makes any sense. So atop this thing are seats and purchases where several members of the Orzhov Syndicate are seated and they're waving to the crowd. Now the Orzhov are a wealthy guild, okay. So when they get gussied up for an event, they go all out. Now, technically, the Orzhov guild colors are black and white, but I would say that their language is gold, right? There's so much gold decorating this small cluster that it's like a direct challenge to the sun as to who can be shinier. And crawling all over these guys are their thrulls, which are these, like, purple grayish little pygmies and they all wear golden masks or half masks and they're squealing with such a sickening delight that it's hard to imagine why the Orzhov keep these things as pets. And they are just showering coins into the crowd by handfuls, just dumping gold coins into the crowd. Now the crowd, excited by money, they all rush forward, swarming the parade. It spooks an Izzet pyrocaster, whose firework goes off prematurely, spooking the alms-beast and it just begins rampaging through the crowd.
Landree 3:37
Oh, no.
Ned 3:38
I would not like to put myself directly and its line of path but I would like to make sure that there's nothing, no one in its line of path.
Brian 3:44
Okay.
Ned 3:45
Clearing a path out in front of it.
Brian 3:46
Give me some sort of Intimidation, probably or Persuasion.
Andrew 3:51
Man, if you'd asked me at any higher level...
Ned 3:56
Non-natural 20.
Brian 3:57
A non-natural 20. I don't think it takes much convincing for the people to go, 'maybe we should GTFO?' This thing is... So the crowd is very sufficiently dissipated. But the people on top of the beast are still in danger. And this thing is crashing into stuff.
Eddie 4:13
So is it, it's like, is it like off running through the...
Andrew 4:13
If anyone--
Brian 4:18
[Alms-beast noises]
Eddie 4:18
Or is it more like, throwing a tantrum in place?
Brian 4:21
It's spooked, it's scared, its tail takes out that old lady, her stand from the other day, the woman who was exonerated from causing problems. She gets punished.
Eddie 4:32
I walk up to it.
Brian 4:33
For being right.
Eddie 4:34
And I say ""Calm!""
Brian 4:37
Oh. Nice. Please, what does it need to roll? What is your saving throw?
Eddie 4:44
13.
Brian 4:44
13. Command?
Eddie 4:46
Yes.
Brian 4:46
Oh, it just like, [alms-beast noise of attention]. And it just kind of stops and stares at you. Like whatever this is, it's more dangerous than whatever I'm afraid of.
Eddie 4:55
""Good boy.""
Brian 4:55
The beast is sufficiently calm. Several Orzhov Syndicate members hop down from their perch and rush over to and, ""Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Well done. I appreciate it. Please, take some coinage for your trouble."" And press into your hands a single Orzhov gold piece.
Eddie 5:17
""Thank you.""
Brian 5:18
Yes. Which you know is bullshit because Orzhov coin is only redeemable at Orzhov facilities. And would somebody please roll another D6 as you continue patrolling the festival?
Sarah 5:32
Five.
Brian 5:33
A five. Ah.
Sarah 5:35
Oh.
Brian 5:36
Everyone, please roll a Perception check.
Eddie 5:38
Oh, by the way.
Brian 5:39
Yes.
Eddie 5:39
I'm holding my bag real tight.
Brian 5:41
Great.
One. That one Orzhov coin. I really want to role play as the next cutpurse is like, 'ha ha, eh, aw...' It's just like one Orzhov coin in there.
Andrew 5:55
15.
Brian 5:55
A 15.
Ned 5:56
23.
Eddie 5:57
What am I rolling?
Brian 5:58
Perception.
Eddie 5:59
Okay. It is...
Sarah 6:00
Zero.
Eddie 6:01
15.
Brian 6:03
You have a negative Perception modifier? You're just like: [noises of aimless wonder].
Ned 6:10
'There are trees.'
Sarah 6:11
I rolled a 2.
Brian 6:12
You are aware of yourself. Barely.
Sarah 6:14
'Like oh my god, I have hooves. I am a lady minotaur.'
Landree 6:18
13.
Brian 6:21
13. Okay, so I'm sorry, Eddie, what did you roll?
Eddie 6:25
15.
Brian 6:26
And you rolled a 15 as well. Okay, as you guys kind of are looking around the crowd, this issue just happened. You kind of catch something from an alleyway that sort of, if you go straight back into an alley and then that alley bends, you can kind of see something just hanging out from around there on the floor. Ned, what did you roll again?
Ned 6:48
23.
Brian 6:48
A 23 is good enough to notice that whatever it is, it's lying in blood and it is red.
Ned 6:55
The blood?
Brian 6:57
The object.
Ned 6:58
Okay.
Brian 6:59
The object itself is different red than the blood is what I meant to say.
Ned 7:03
Copy. Yeah, got it. I was like, when... Is there non-red blood? Is that a thing I need to start looking for?
Brian 7:10
Sorry, the blood itself is not red. The body is red.
Ned 7:16
Copy. Thanks. I'mma head down the alley.
Brian 7:21
Yes.
Ned 7:22
Maybe not at a full speed in case there's something down there that might attack me.
Brian 7:26
Your Perception is high enough that there is...
Ned 7:29
Great.
Brian 7:29
Eerily quiet.
Ned 7:30
So that's when the Perception would be needed. So anyway, I'm going to go down and I would like to quick, investigate, just like quick passive perception, investigate the body. What do I see? Do I recognize--
Brian 7:42
It's a torso.
Ned 7:43
It is a torso, armless, legless, headless?
Brian 7:45
Armless, legless, headless.
Ned 7:47
With not-red blood?
Brian 7:49
In a pool of darkened blood. That's just about black.
Andrew 7:53
And the torso is red?
Brian 7:55
The torso is red.
Ned 7:56
Like clothed in red, or is red?
Brian 7:58
It is a goblin torso.
Ned 8:00
Yeah.
Brian 8:01
You see a goblin torso.
Ned 8:03
I would like to investigate the torso without disturbing too much of the crime scene.
Brian 8:07
Give me an Investigation or Medicine.
Andrew 8:11
Lorzatch will assist.
Ned 8:11
21 on Investigation.
Brian 8:13
Were you at the site to assist Skyx when he was being strung up?
Ned 8:19
No, I was there but I wasn't one of the people.
Brian 8:22
But you were present.
Ned 8:23
I was present.
Brian 8:23
You have seen him.
Ned 8:23
Yes, I was there with Skyx.
Brian 8:25
This is the dismembered body of Skyx lying in an alley.
Ned 8:27
Skyx! Insert cue sad music.
Andrew 8:30
Yeah.
Sarah 8:30
You killed Skyx?
Landree 8:30
No!
Brian 8:35
You rolled on the D6.
Sarah 8:36
Don't you put this on me.
Ned 8:36
How dare you Sarah?
Landree 8:45
You murdered Skyx!
Sarah 8:46
[unintelligible]
Landree 8:49
Sarah murdered Skyx!
Ned 8:51
So, beyond noticing it's the dismembered body of Skyx...
Brian 8:55
Yes.
Ned 8:55
Weeping.
Brian 8:56
Yes.
Ned 8:56
Very loudly.
Brian 8:57
Yes.
Ned 8:59
Is there anything that would suggest a culprit like again, a footprint, anything like that? Or is it again, surgical, clinical, clean?
Brian 9:07
Surgical, clinical cleanliness.
Ned 9:09
Copy. And how wide a radius does the crime scene seem to cover?
Brian 9:15
It seems to, it covers just enough as the blood could possibly leak out.
Ned 9:21
Got it. But there's not like a spray?
Brian 9:23
Nope, it's just oozing like somebody turned on a faucet.
Andrew 9:27
23 for Investigation, we got anything else in this alleyway? As far as clues, material evidence, aside from the obvious dismembered torso of Skyx, and an alley full of goblin blood.
Brian 9:27
And it just dripped out of the body.
Ned 9:27
Copy.
Brian 9:46
Again, eerily clean, somebody who very clearly was probably fast enough to not leave any evidence. But this is the second person you have found like this.
Andrew 10:00
""We have to consider the possibility that this is a demon.""
Sarah 10:05
That's bad.
Andrew 10:05
""What we know from the enchantments in place at the Leg End is that whatever or whoever did this has structures that can lacerate and remove the parts of a humanoid body, almost instantaneously, integrated enough to not trigger the enchantments at Leg End.""
Ned 10:24
But we saw that with the biomechanical arm thing. We don't know that it's a demon as much as it could be another construct-style appendage.
Andrew 10:32
Yeah, that could be.
Sarah 10:34
The theater! The theater that he works at! We need to go to that theater! Skyx works at the theater, we could, took him to the theater, the theater where to go, and the Rakdos goes, they perform--ears. We need to go to the theater.
Andrew 10:46
But what connection exists between that theater, a murder at a tavern, and now this dead body?
Eddie 10:53
The theater is the only thing we know about this goblin.
Ned 10:56
That's true. We know more about Skyx than we knew about the other guy.
Sarah 10:58
The other guy could have been there.
Investigating Skyx could help us learn about the other guy.
Andrew 11:02
That's really the only lead we have.
Ned 11:05
Quite literally.
Brian 11:06
Are you heading into the theater row?
Eddie 11:08
Yes.
Brian 11:09
Okay, so the adventurers, very confusedly, stumble down the Theatre Row, not sure what they're looking for. But you do manage to find the theater that you dropped Skyx at. As you march down towards that theater, you happen to notice that the theater across the street has a very vibrant and very exciting-looking advertisement that says 'Fire Circus' with a pattern that may be similar to the one that you are holding.
Sarah 11:42
We need to check the theater across the street.
Brian 11:44
There looks like there is a bit of a tear on the banner.
Andrew 11:47
Did the banner dismember a person at the tavern?
Sarah 11:50
I think what it is, is, and this might be a little far-fetched, but what could, it could be is the gentleman torso who was killed could have been at the theater that Skyx was at and saw the advertisement across the street and it was more interested in going to that one than the theater that Skyx was at. And Skyx was thinking about going to that theater because that theater is going to have more business. And it's the owner of the theater that Skyx was working at!
Ned 11:50
The banner did it!
Brian 12:26
What's your intelligence modifier?
Sarah 12:28
Zero.
Eddie 12:29
Me too. ""Good idea!""
Brian 12:35
There is, there is a Rakdos performance banner that says 'Fire Circus.' And there looks like there is a tear in a part of the banner.
Ned 12:45
Does the piece of cloth fit the banner?
Brian 12:48
Would you like to check?
Ned 12:49
Yeah, for sure.
Brian 12:50
So, Brevin, as you produce the piece of black and red checkered cloth, and you approach this Rakdos banner, you grab hold of the banner, as if to try and match the pieces to see whether or not it came from this, and it does. But in doing so, the banner sort of unfurls a little bit more, and you realize that what you thought said 'Fire,' based on the crimpling of the banner, there's actually more to it. And as the banner sort of droops down and unfurls to its full length, it very clearly says 'Murder Circus.'
Ned 13:25
'Murder Circus.'
Brian 13:32
It says 'Murder Circus.'
Ned 13:35
I'm just going to put this out there.
Sarah 13:37
Oh this is not good.
Ned 13:38
This is the kind of thing that should be banned in Ravnica.
Brian 13:41
That is the opinion of a Selesnyan.
Ned 13:43
Yes!
Andrew 13:45
Guildpact.
Brian 13:46
Guildpact.
For those of you whose characters are old enough to remember...
One of you. In history, you would have heard the tale, very recently, within the last 70 years of when the demon Rakdos reawoke and saved the city from like a massive kaiju attack. The Cult of Rakdos is mostly in control of mining and smelting within the world of Ravnica. They also manage a great deal of day labor and cheap labor. On top of also controlling a good portion of the entertainment areas of Ravnica that is sort of balanced with the Orzhov who controls some of the more seedy aspects, prostitution and the like. The Rakdos are given free rein to have these performances based on the rules of not only the Guildpact, but also because attendance is voluntary, although it is not unheard of to hear people being kidnapped and forced into these performance. A common trope within the Rakdos is, 'it's not fun and games until someone loses an eye.' And now just a quick word from one of our sponsors.
Andrew 13:52
Probably.
AD BREAK
Eddie 15:25
I say we check out this murder circus.
Ned 15:28
I think that's the most metal thing I've ever heard.
Sarah 15:32
Like, while it's going or like before it happens?
Ned 15:35
I mean, like two people have been murdered, so...
Eddie 15:37
We need to see what's going on.
Landree 15:38
I think the circus is happening.
Ned 15:40
Yeah, there's been some murder.
Landree 15:41
Yeah.
Sarah 15:42
Maybe by healing the banner we've made it all stop.
Brian 15:47
The banner's not healed. They just don't--
Ned 15:48
Yeah.
Brian 15:49
Would we like to proceed inside to the Murder Circus?
Ned 15:53
Generally speaking, no, but...
Andrew 15:54
Maybe not before we report what we've found.
Ned 15:57
Yeah, no, I agree.
Brian 15:59
Okay.
Ned 15:59
Let's not what into a murder circus before telling the authorities.
Andrew 16:02
Because here's the other thing: this is protected by the Guildpact.
Ned 16:06
By the murder of other guilds?
Andrew 16:08
If it is true that a Rakdos cultist broke in and murdered someone, not as part of a performance, this could be prosecuted.
Brian 16:20
Justicar, would you please make an Intelligence check with advantage?
Eddie 16:26
18.
Brian 16:29
Within the boundaries of law, if they did commit a murder outside of their leased property, that is straight up murder. They are not protected by the Guildpact simply because they're a cult that enjoys murder.
Eddie 16:41
""I will not sit idly by while these cultists commit murders around my city. Justice will be done.""
Andrew 16:50
""Nor am I asking you to. The only thing we need to consider is if storming a protected bastion of the Rakdos Guild is a stark violation of the Guildpact and puts us in even deeper--
Eddie 17:05
We are not storming.
Sarah 17:08
I knock on the door.
Brian 17:09
It's not a door. It's a cavity, like it's opening into the theater. There's not a, there's just, there's just an open entry way that you can go in, and inside you can hear...
Sarah 17:20
Murder.
Ned 17:20
Murder.
Brian 17:22
Give me a Perception check.
Landree 17:24
Oh, one.
Sarah 17:26
I rolled an 18.
Brian 17:27
Hooray!
Ned 17:28
Nailed it. Wait--
Brian 17:29
Great.
An 18 with your minus two?
Sarah 17:31
Yeah!
Ned 17:35
You nat-20'd?
Sarah 17:35
Yeah!
Brian 17:36
You nat-20'd? Great. So it's not very difficult to hear that there is activity going on inside but it is not a performance. There does not seem to be people in there, any sort of practicing going on. There's a couple of people laughing and joking. There's the sound of some metal maybe a little bit here and there. But there is, there is no evident performance going on. Right now.
Sarah 17:58
If we go in and ask that maybe, a, if they're missing any of their performers? Might that be a good idea?
Ned 18:07
I can't see why not. I mean, I can see why not. But I'm here.
Brian 18:11
Then you hear a very loud scream.
Ned 18:16
God damn it.
Andrew 18:17
And in we go.
Brian 18:20
It is the same scream that you heard in the tavern.
Ned 18:24
She back? Let's go.
Eddie 18:26
I run to it.
Brian 18:26
As you guys rush in to the circus of murder to try and understand who or what could possibly be repeating this scream, you enter to see a circus ring. There's sand on the floor. There are two red and black spiraled struts that shoot straight up towards the ceiling, over which a tight rope is stretched. Sitting and working in the middle of this ring are a couple of Rakdos performers, each specializing in different details. One of them is breathing fire. One of them is juggling knives. The other one is doing some sort of chain escape trick. A quick glance around after being immediately surprised by this Rakdos setting, you can see what looks to be the tied-up form of Elazia dangling from some sort of contraption over a massive vat that is at least glowing enough to make her frightened to be hanging there. Above her is a platform of which stands a Harlequin in Rakdos colors with his hands outstretched with two wooden crosses that you would carry in as marionettes. And he kind of sees you and goes, ""Ooh, welcome to this show, boys and girls! Please meet today's prize performers!"" And sort of magically, seemingly out of behind him, these two marionettes sort of dance out in front of them. These marionettes are all limbs and no torso. They are one male, one goblin; just dangling limbs in the rough shapes of these humans, as he sort of can magically manipulate them outward, away from his body.
Ned 20:15
Skyx, no!
Brian 20:16
Let's roll Initiative!
As you guys saddle up for this fight that is about to begin, anyone within earshot can clearly hear this sort of very strange, loud, mechanical click, and you see Elazia drop just a little bit of space. And the marionette is like: [maniacal laughter]
There are three circus performers in front of you. One is juggling knives, one is holding a torch, and one is now spinning chains.
Ned 20:49
Was it clear with a click came from?
Brian 20:51
Behind, so, outside the ring is still kind of in dark. It's, it's sort of overlit, like: [sound of high-power lights igniting] 'Welcome to the show.'
Ned 20:58
Right.
Brian 20:59
So wherever that mechanism is, it is behind that platform and that vat.
Ned 21:04
Got it, thanks.
Brian 21:05
We ready?
Sarah 21:06
I'm ready.
Brian 21:06
First up: Zenia.
Landree 21:08
Um, okay...
Brian 21:09
I will say that the, the...
Ned 21:11
Is it clear how far she fell? Like, does it feel like there's a time limit we can easily discern? Like, 10 clicks 'til she's in the vat? Is there, like, any kind of... Know what I mean?
Brian 21:19
Based on the judgment that you have seen her fall? I would say that she fell about 25% of the distance she was in between here and there.
Ned 21:27
So like a potential four clicks if it were to go all the way.
Landree 21:30
I cast Chill Touch at the Harlequin guy.
Brian 21:34
Now, do you need to be in range?
Landree 21:36
It's 120 feet.
Brian 21:37
Oh, okay.
Landree 21:38
Yeah. 15.
Brian 21:40
Okay, a 15 does hit.
Landree 21:43
Okay. For six points of necrotic damage.
Brian 21:45
For six points of necrotic damage. You are throwing this spell?
Landree 21:49
Yeah.
Brian 21:49
You can see that, as you throw the spell, the way that his marionettes seem to be sort of dancing is one of the marionettes almost just sort of like voluntarily, like, 'ooh!' kind of throws itself in the way and takes the spell full-on.
Landree 22:04
Damn it.
Brian 22:05
And the marrio-- the, the Harlequin is very quickly like, ""Oh, oh."" Like, 'oh shit,' like, 'this was going to be sweet. I was just going to sacrifice this but, oh, if they keep throwing spells like this, I'm not very happy about that.'
Landree 22:18
Okay.
Brian 22:18
Fikarra.
Sarah 22:21
So... Yeah, I guess I'll just straight up tackle the person in front of me, who was, I think, the fire guy?
Brian 22:27
It is the fire guy.
Sarah 22:29
Okay. That is a 25.
Brian 22:31
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Sarah 22:34
Okay. That's eight.
Brian 22:35
You stab him with the horns for eight damage. Okay, he's been non-sussed. But he's laughing. Full on stabbing with your horns and he seems to think of it as a joke.
Sarah 22:46
Okay.
Brian 22:49
Brevin, you are up.
Ned 22:51
Okay, well, I am going to run actually to the exact same attacker.
Brian 22:57
Okay.
Ned 22:58
I am then going to, yeah, right. Just attacking that same attacker. I'm going to long sword attack on that same person.
Brian 23:07
Yes, please. He looks at you. ""Oh, you as well.""
Ned 23:10
23.
Brian 23:11
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Ned 23:13
And three.
Brian 23:13
Three damage.
Ned 23:14
I'm then going to Action Surge. And I'm going to... I can take one additional action, right?
Brian 23:21
Yes.
Ned 23:21
So then I would like to Dash to the platform.
Brian 23:25
Okay. You will receive an attack of opportunity.
Ned 23:27
I know. Okay.
Brian 23:28
Yes. So you will get attacked by this gentleman here. 15?
Ned 23:34
18's the Armor Class.
Brian 23:35
18 is the Armor Class, so he misses. He kind of has like a weird trumpet horn thing anyway, so he's like [noise].
Ned 23:43
I want that face enshrined.
Andrew 23:46
Gets poked in the teeth with the mouthpiece.
Brian 23:48
""Glad to see you're getting into it."" They're up. So...
Andrew 23:52
He's at the platform?
Ned 23:53
I'm now on the platform.
Brian 23:53
Well, he's, yeah, he's at the stairs in front of the marionettes. So the first thing that lines up is this trumpeter, this fire breather that you have kind of ignored, kind of turns to you and is like, 'great,' almost as if he doesn't need to deal with you, and then turns directly to you and says, ""How about a hot kiss?"" And just--whoosh--blows through this horn and just bro-- just fire, everywhere.
Sarah 24:15
No barbecue joke? I'm disappointed.
Brian 24:25
It is actually a 30-foot cone. So it will hit everyone, I believe.
Ned 24:31
Does that mean--
Brian 24:32
Everybody within the cone, make a DC 13 Dexterity throw.
Eddie 24:35
I made it.
Andrew 24:37
22.
Landree 24:38
19.
Sarah 24:38
Ooh, 22! Nat 20.
Brian 24:43
So you all made it?
Andrew 24:44
Yes.
Brian 24:44
Good. Then you get half damage. You each take three points of fire damage.
Sarah 24:50
Eh. Rude.
Eddie 24:50
[Growls]
Brian 24:54
The knife thrower looks at you three in the back and decides, maybe you need to come in and be a part of the show. So, they are, the knife thrower has three daggers, which he's going to throw, one at each of you.
Ned 25:05
Did it come back to him, or is it, at least he's not disarmed.
Brian 25:08
He's got like a ton of them on his body.
Ned 25:10
Bolero of daggers.
Brian 25:12
Yes. So...
Ned 25:15
Bandolier was the word I wanted.
Brian 25:16
Andrew, with Lorzatch, is a 19?
Andrew 25:18
Yeah, that hits.
Brian 25:18
Zenia, is a 14.
Landree 25:20
Damn it. Yep.
Brian 25:23
And Lennox, Eddie, is a three.
Eddie 25:25
18.
Brian 25:26
Is a three. So, for those of you who took damage, let's see here. Andrew will take four piercing damage and, Zenia, you will take two piercing damage.
Landree 25:38
Oh, great. Okay.
Brian 25:39
And then the third performer, who's been juggling his chains, kind of stares you down, Fikarra, and goes ""I want to keep you for myself,"" and just whips both of these chains at to you. He has a multi-attack, which he will attack you twice.
Sarah 25:53
Okay.
Brian 25:55
And, sorry, he is going to move one space forward but no more because he has a reach of 10 feet. And then he is going to, as these chains sort of come towards you, you notice that, oh, there's like razor blades on these chains, like they're actually chain-link razor blades.
Ned 26:10
Barbed wire?
Brian 26:12
Not barbed wire, like linked together razor blades.
Ned 26:14
Oh shit.
Brian 26:14
Yes. The first one is a ten, the second one is an eight. He's probably the least skilled of the people in the room now. Lorzatch, you're up, my friend.
Andrew 26:23
Lorzatch is going to move up to these other folks. He's going to activate his spores and, as a bonus action, is going to cast Healing Word on Fikarra. And Fikarra is going to heal seven hit points.
Brian 26:42
Okay, so. The Harlequin dances his two marionettes and they sort of dance at you, Brevin.
Ned 26:49
Yep.
Brian 26:50
The marionettes sort of dance at you and cackle as through Skyx's mouth, the Harlequin's voice comes out and just sort of giggles in that very pathetic goblin voice that you heard him have and just says, ""You're never going to save her in time!"" Please make a Wisdom saving throw.
Ned 27:11
That's not great for me.
Brian 27:12
As you have been mocked viciously.
Ned 27:14
Fucking asshole. Oh, we're doing fine here. It's a 21.
Brian 27:18
Yes. Okay, so you are completely fine by that. But what you do see, also, after that spell cast is a another marionette surprisingly appears directly to his right that looks to be the limbs of what possibly could be some sort of Orzhov Syndicate member.
Ned 27:37
Ah, quick Perception check: is that being controlled by someone other than the Harlequin?
Brian 27:43
You can make an Investigation check on your turn. Lennox, you are up.
Eddie 27:44
Lennox steps into the room and casts Guiding Bolt.
Brian 27:49
Guiding Bolt!
Eddie 27:51
At asshole controlling the marionette.
Brian 27:53
Okay.
Eddie 27:55
Fumble!
Brian 27:56
Uh oh! He kind of giggles.
Eddie 27:58
Wasted spell slot.
Brian 28:00
""Someone needs a little bit of practice!"" So after you have missed your Guiding Bolt and the Harlequin is mocking you sarcastically, you see Elazia click--
Ned 28:11
Another 25%?
Brian 28:11
She has dropped about a third of the distance that she was from there to the vat. Top of the order. Zenia.
Landree 28:18
I cast False Life on myself.
Brian 28:20
Okay.
Landree 28:20
For an additional eight temporary hit points.
Brian 28:23
And that gets you temporary hit points.
Landree 28:26
I'm up to 13.
Brian 28:26
Great. You are up to 13. Would you like to move for any reason?
Landree 28:30
No.
Brian 28:30
Okay. Fikarra, you are up.
Sarah 28:33
I'm going to attack.
Brian 28:34
Yes.
Sarah 28:35
And Bardic Inspiration, giving it to Brevin.
Brian 28:37
Okay.
Sarah 28:38
Rolled an 18. So that's like a 24.
Brian 28:40
Your attack lands.
Sarah 28:41
Yeah.
Brian 28:41
Please roll damage with your mace.
Sarah 28:43
Going to, yes.
Ned 28:46
Yes!
Sarah 28:46
Going to be nine.
Brian 28:47
Great.
Landree 28:48
Nice.
Sarah 28:48
And then Bardic Inspiration to Brevin.
Brian 28:51
Nine damage. Looks like it's just about to put this guy down. Like he's, like, again, you keep making these attacks that you're surprised, like, don't immediately kill this person. And maybe with just a touch more experience under your belt, you might be able to close this a turn early.
Brevin, you are sufficiently inspired. What would you like to do?
Ned 29:13
I am going to... This is what my turn is going to be, in all.
Brian 29:17
Okay.
Ned 29:17
Going to rush past the marionettes.
Brian 29:18
Okay.
Ned 29:18
Going to use the long sword to go after one of the hands holding a cross.
Brian 29:23
Okay, based on the narrowness of the stairs, only one of them will get an attack on you.
Ned 29:28
Okay.
Brian 29:28
Which will be the Skyx --
Ned 29:29
Sure.
Brian 29:30
--marionette. So if you would like to move past them into the space where you can attack the Harlequin--
Ned 29:35
Yes, that's exactly what I would like to do.
Brian 29:37
Skyx will make an attack on you.
Ned 29:38
Great.
Brian 29:39
A 15.
Ned 29:40
18 is my armor.
Brian 29:41
18 is too high for that tiny little dismembered goblin. So you move past him up the stairs. You now find yourself face to face with the Harlequin.
Ned 29:51
And rather than going directly for the Harlequin, I want to go for the marionette thing.
Brian 29:54
In his hand?
Ned 29:55
Yeah, the thing controlling the, the creations.
Brian 29:59
Are in his hand.
Ned 30:00
Yes, I would like to use my sword to try and take that hand off.
Brian 30:03
Okay, so you have two options. The marionettes are clearly determined by side.
Ned 30:09
Right.
Brian 30:10
So as you're facing him, his right hand, to your left, would be controlling the goblin Skyx, and then his opposite hand will be controlling the man who you know nothing about.
Ned 30:19
The man seems, would suggest to me to be a stronger, so I would go for the man.
Brian 30:23
Okay, please make a Strength roll.
Ned 30:25
With Bardic Inspiration.
Brian 30:27
With Bardic Inspiration.
Ned 30:28
So that is a 26.
Brian 30:29
Oh for the love of-- Oh... Good. You manage to sort of dodge in, give a flick of your wrist with the sword, you whack his hand and he kind of loses the cross immediately. As it leaves his hand, the marionette of the man, who you do not know, just great crumples into the sand.
Ned 30:50
Great.
Brian 30:50
It is now the cultists' turns.
Andrew 30:53
Which ones?
Brian 30:54
Ah. They're all going to act, which, does it matter?
Andrew 30:57
The flame thrower and the chain man.
Brian 31:00
Yes.
Andrew 31:01
Both get to make Constitution saving throws.
Brian 31:03
Okay, we can start with them. That's fine. The chain guy is a nine and the fire guy is a four.
You'd think Rakdos cult members would have higher Constitution. Are you giggling?
Ned 31:18
Yes.
Brian 31:18
Into the mic while I'm complaining?
Ned 31:20
He is giggling into the mic. Yes. That's exactly what is happening.
Andrew 31:23
Both take six necrotic damage.
Brian 31:25
Oh, for real? Well, that fire breather is dead. He is just dead.
Landree 31:31
Duh dead duh dead.
Brian 31:33
The...
Ned 31:33
Does the crowd go wild?
Brian 31:36
The chain wielder, who is a little upset, so...
Andrew 31:40
""Are you under the weather?""
Brian 31:40
What is this ability that we're using with? What is it?
Andrew 31:44
Halo of Spores.
Brian 31:45
Halo of Spores. So they kind of get geared up, ready to do another strike and just a cloud kind of waves over them, and you see them kind of [sniffing] kind of breathe in and get kind of dizzy like a murdered cave troll, and the fire guy takes a big breath as if to try and breathe some more fire at you guys, but it's just not going to come out and as this breath just sort of chokes inside his cavity, he just [gasp] and then just falls down to the floor as little wisps of pollen leak from his orifice.
Sarah 32:16
Does that affect me too?
Andrew 32:17
No.
Brian 32:18
The, the blade wielder or the, the chain wielder is clearly put off by whatever this is and goes, ""Oh, I'll show you now with my whips!"" and then kind of whips them around very violently. He seems less confident than before because that first attack-- everyone in the circus is doing so well. But he kind of came up short. So he's going to swing both of his whips at you, Andrew, the first one is going to be a 11 and the next one is going to be a five. This dude sucks so much and he does like the most damage. He just, he's just-- [angry flailing]
Ned 32:57
Love you boo boo.
Brian 32:59
""Oh, I've failed my teachers.""
Andrew 33:00
""I'm sorry. Are you feeling woozy?""
Brian 33:07
Now I'm creeped out. Okay. The, the knife wielder though is pretty upset at the three of you up there in the front. So one attack is going to go to Fikarra, which is an eight, and then two other blades are going to come at you, Lorzatch, this one is a two and a four. Great. Challenging combat, everybody. Please, please continue. Lorzatch, it is actually your turn. So.
Andrew 33:38
Lorzatch takes both blades to the flailing knifeman. I'm sorry, chainman. Does a 20 hit?
Brian 33:48
Yeah.
Eddie 33:52
He says, exasperated.
Brian 33:55
This guy, like, the Rakdos don't wear armor.
Ned 33:58
They want to die.
Brian 33:59
Yeah, no, they're like giggling every time they get hit. Although spores are not funny to them. Getting stabbed and cut and stuff is fine. But the spores are not enjoyable.
Andrew 34:08
19 damage.
Brian 34:10
For the love of everything. All right, how does it happen?
Andrew 34:13
He catches a chain link with his dagger, flips it around so that the razor blade wraps around his head. You get to watch the filaments start growing in between and spreading out of the lacerations in his skull before he pulls and splits his cranium in two.
Landree 34:32
Yes!
Eddie 34:32
[grim laughter]
Brian 34:32
Oh my god.
Landree 34:32
That is pretty.
Brian 34:36
Awesome. Okay, so--
Ned 34:38
Landree, I learn more about you every day.
Charisma save.
Brian 34:39
The Harlequin, he's now looking directly at you and is, Brevin, and is starting to lose enjoyment in this performer, and he's like, ""No, no, no, you're not playing correctly! Be gone, back to the seats!"" and he kind of puts a hand up and gives a big flash of, sort of red light that emanates from his hand. Please give me a Charisma saving throw.
Eddie 34:59
Everyone?
Brian 35:07
Just Ned.
Ned 35:08
What is my Charisma?
Brian 35:10
You're okay.
Ned 35:12
18.
Brian 35:13
An 18. Man, you're rolling like crazy. Whatever he tried to do, you are a man on a mission. And he says-- crap.
Landree 35:24
And he says, 'crap.'
Brian 35:27
""No no, why won't you listen? You're just ruining the fun!"" Lennox, you are up.
Eddie 35:34
I run up to this abomination and I bring down my mace.
Ned 35:40
On?
Eddie 35:41
On its head.
Brian 35:42
On Skyx the marionette?
Eddie 35:44
Yes.
Ned 35:45
Oh no.
Eddie 35:46
That's plus... [strange noise while Eddie does math]
Brian 35:52
This is a really, this was a really aggressive play they got less confident as the dice hit.
Eddie 35:59
Plus five.
Brian 35:59
Plus five.
Eddie 36:00
Yeah.
Brian 36:01
Well it's plus five. I don't know what the actual number is. You rolled a seven. A 12 hits.
Landree 36:06
Nice!
Eddie 36:09
[satisfied chuckle]
Brian 36:09
Barely hits.
Eddie 36:11
Four points of damage.
Brian 36:12
Well, it is sort of just a collection of limbs.
So as you kind of bring your, even though the determination is there, even though you're like, 'I'm going to free you from this horrible fate, my little goblin,' you kind of come down and swing but it's just kind of limbs that just sort of part ways and just sort of flop around.
Ned 36:15
Right.
Sarah 36:29
You get a little less confident when Skyx looks you directly in the eye and one little tear just comes out of his little dismembered goblin face.
Landree 36:40
I thought he doesn't have a head?
Brian 36:41
No, the head is there, but he is dead.
Landree 36:43
Oh, the head is there.
Brian 36:45
He's dead. There is no, there is no emotion. As you see this-- yes, sir.
Eddie 36:50
Are they undead?
Brian 36:50
Are they undead? No, they are--
Ned 36:52
Are they constructs?
Brian 36:53
They are animated limbs. They are the limbs of these people that are now being flopped around like marionettes. After your less than effective swing of your mace, you see Elazia tick down a mere half the distance from where she was to this vat and you're quite confident, if something isn't done immediately...
Eddie 37:17
I look around--
Brian 37:18
There's not going to be anything to retrieve.
Eddie 37:20
--the room for like a lever or...
Brian 37:21
The contraption is attached to the top of the platform. There is, there is a chain suspending her that goes up somewhere towards the roof of the theater--
Eddie 37:30
Like where he's standing?
Brian 37:31
It goes up towards where the roof of the theater is and winches back down to a contraption directly behind her up on the platform, that is now sort of being straddled by that Orzhov marionette.
Landree 37:43
Like right here?
Brian 37:44
Yes. Top of the order. Zenia.
Landree 37:48
I cast Chaos Bolt, aiming for the, his hand, the motherfucker's hand.
Brian 37:55
Yes.
Landree 37:55
Okay. Please, please, please, please, please. So that is 19.
Brian 38:03
Yes. Please roll a D20.
Landree 38:05
Well I already rolled. That was my D20.
Brian 38:07
I know. Please roll another D20.
Landree 38:08
Another? Oh! That would be an 18.
Brian 38:13
Okay, you are well in control of your magic for this round.
Landree 38:17
Fantastic. So, uh, so I'm aiming for that, I did it. So I get 2D8. So my first one was--
Brian 38:25
So, so just to be clear,
Landree 38:27
Yes.
Brian 38:27
Targeting an attack with a spell is not possible.
Landree 38:31
Oh, okay.
Brian 38:31
So if you grapple a character or making like a weapon strike, you must have an opposing Strength check.
Landree 38:39
Yeah.
Brian 38:39
In order to disarm, so whatever you're doing must, must be a Strength-based action.
Landree 38:44
Oh, I can't aim a spell.
Brian 38:46
No, but you can just like light him up.
Landree 38:48
I can? Okay, then I'll just light him up, please.
Brian 38:51
Like, it's not... you can just kill him. As an option.
Landree 38:55
I would like to light him up. So my first number, it's only two points of damage, but it's fire.
Brian 39:00
That's fine. So you--
Andrew 39:02
No, it's, sorry, that's 13 points of damage.
Landree 39:04
Is it?
Andrew 39:05
Yeah, 2D8 plus one D6? You rolled 13 points of damage.
Landree 39:09
I thought the D8 was just me getting to pick.
Andrew 39:12
No, that's damage.
Landree 39:13
Oh.
Brian 39:14
No, you just choose.
Landree 39:15
Oh, fantastic.
Andrew 39:16
It is...
Brian 39:17
So she rolls...
Andrew 39:17
... quite good.
Landree 39:18
Yeah! That's gorgeous! Okay. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So 13. Thanks everyone for your patience.
Brian 39:18
Yeah, so that's a lot different. Thank you for the clarification.
Landree 39:25
Yes. Thank you.
Brian 39:26
So you light him up with a great deal of fire and he starts immolating, kind of, there's rules about catching fire, but he certainly takes a big wave of fire. And he seems to shower in it. He's like, ""Yes! Finally, someone is enjoying this show!"" It is clearly damaging to him but he doesn't... They're crazy. He seems to be enjoying it.
Landree 39:54
And much as Landree was confused about the damage, Zenia was a little bit like, 'Great! Look at what I did.'
Brian 40:04
Fikarra.
Sarah 40:05
Okay, I'm going up to the, so, walking up to the bat and, you know, I'm just going to Thunderclap. Sorry guys.
Ned 40:12
Let's do it.
Brian 40:13
Interesting.
Sarah 40:14
Because--
Brian 40:14
And if they fail, they get pushed, right?
Sarah 40:16
Yep, they fail, they get pushed.
Brian 40:17
They take damage either way, but if they faill, they get pushed 10 feet?
Sarah 40:20
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's Thunderwave, not thunderclap. So, wave of thunder's force...
Brian 40:25
I'm sorry, I'm assuming you meant Thunderwave.
Sarah 40:27
Yes.
Brian 40:28
You want to attack them.
Sarah 40:29
Correct.
Brian 40:29
And if they failed their rolls, they get pushed.
Sarah 40:31
Correct.
Brian 40:32
Away.
Sarah 40:32
Correct.
Brian 40:33
Love it.
Sarah 40:34
All right. It's a Constitution saving throw.
Ned 40:36
On me too?
Sarah 40:37
On everybody.
Brian 40:37
Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from you.
Ned 40:42
I'm definitely in there.
Brian 40:43
Well...
Andrew 40:44
Yeah, everybody except Lennox over here.
Brian 40:46
What's the, what's the number?
Sarah 40:49
The CON save's 13.
Brian 41:02
So you unleash this wave of thunder in desperation, gotta save this woman, and the thunder reaches out and slams into the Harlequin. But it also catches your companion Brevin full on in the side. The two of them get thrown off the back of the platform. And you hear them land with a thud but they're both behind there somewhere. You see the dangling marionette of Skyx, damaged slightly, but it's still kind of dangling there. But it doesn't look like it's physically intruce, intruding anything. The marionettes of the Orzhov Syndicate member who is currently sort of like at the contraption has not moved, reacted at all. It's still just, still just wiggling and jiggling.
Sarah 41:41
Sorry Brevin.
Brian 41:42
Brevin, you're prone.
Ned 41:44
Yeah, I'm definitely prone. So I was going to try and do something to help what's-her-name, but I am no longer in a capacity to do so. So I am going to do the old action movie roll-and-stab. We're both on the ground behind the platform. I'm going immediately for the jugular.
Brian 42:00
You are just right on him.
Ned 42:02
Yeah. So I am, straight attack while he's--
Brian 42:06
With advantage.
Ned 42:06
--prone. On him.
Brian 42:08
Yep.
Ned 42:10
It was a 21 and a 18, so 21.
Brian 42:12
Both are good. Choose the one you like.
Ned 42:14
I like a 21. Feels nice to say. It is a 9.
Brian 42:18
A 9?
Ned 42:19
Yeah.
Brian 42:20
So please describe this horrible mangled grapple as this guy goes down.
Ned 42:24
So we get blown off the back of a stage and it doesn't feel great. We land in the sand and we're both sort of like, like recovering and I realize that my sword is right at my hand and I grab it and I roll over and I put one arm at his chest and I shove the entire thing through his head, digging into the sand on the far side.
Brian 42:43
So as you kind of shove the knife into you, he, he, into him, he's still looking at you and laughing and giggling as it goes in and just goes [sinister laughter] ""What a finale."" [death rattle] And then just sort of like dies in your hand. You guys at the front of the platform do not see what's going on but you do suddenly see the marionette of Skyx just sort of fall to the floor and the marionette of the Orzhov Syndicate member just sort of dissipates into nothing. It was simply an illusion. There is the dagger thrower who is still at the end of it. He goes, ""Fat lady hasn't sung yet, folks,"" and kind of [sound of drawing knives] brings out some daggers. He is going to throw them at Fikarra.
One, two, three. [sound of flying daggers]
Sarah 43:33
Hold on a second let me get my surprised cow face.
Brian 43:37
I have an 18, a 19, and a 21.
Sarah 43:43
Well gee. I think all of those are gonna hit.
Brian 43:46
All of those hit?
Sarah 43:47
Yeah.
Brian 43:47
Let's get ready.
Sarah 43:49
Gosh dag nabbit all to heck.
Brian 43:51
Yeah, he really was like, 'oh, now that you're not paying attention.'
Landree 43:54
Oh god.
Brian 43:56
So, you will take a total of 9 piercing damage.
Landree 44:01
Could have been worse.
Brian 44:04
Daggers, or, throwing knives, aren't...
Andrew 44:06
How you doing?
Brian 44:06
...super dangerous.
Sarah 44:08
I'm at half. So.
Landree 44:09
Oh. That's not so bad.
Brian 44:10
Not bad.
Sarah 44:10
Yeah. No, we're good.
Brian 44:12
Okay, Lorzatch, you have a turn.
Andrew 44:16
And Lorzatch moves 25 feet to stop the contraption in its tracks and do his best to fish...
Brian 44:24
Please make an Intelligence check or a save, or, Strength check, whichever one you would prefer to do.
Andrew 44:30
That'll be an Intelligence check, folks. In which I am proficient. Hell yeah, buddy. 10.
Brian 44:37
A 10. You can clearly identify that this is a simple lever. It is not hard. The, the Rakdos. The Rakdos, I would say a 10 or above you're pretty okay. Like they're not known for being clever. It is really just a simple winch.
Andrew 44:56
Cease it from cranking down any further.
Brian 44:58
Great. As you grab it, you do manage to activate the winch. But you do take seven piercing damage from razor blades that were hidden in the handle. It would have been great if somebody was close to zero hit points. As kind of a last giggle. So the winch has stopped. Elazia is dangling, still screaming at you.
Ned 45:21
Kind of surprised the dagger throat didn't try and take down that rope.
Brian 45:23
You guys can see Brevin sort of getting up from the back, and can kind of ascertain with some of the blood on his face that...
Sarah 45:31
It's real gross.
Brian 45:32
'I got him.'
Andrew 45:35
Is it possible to take a bonus action to reach out?
Ned 45:40
And touch faith.
Brian 45:42
Yes. The, as you guys clearly kind of managed to salvage the situation, the final Rakdos performer has somehow managed to dissipate into the shadows. And you can hear a giggling that just sort of persists.
Eddie 46:01
Son of a bitch.
Brian 46:02
He's not a major threat. He's clearly, simply just a performer. The Harlequin was obviously the person orchestrating this, but you have managed to save Elazia from a bubbly watery death. As you bring her down, you guys get a chance to collect yourselves, except it isn't long, once again, until the Boros legionnaires show up to investigate.
Wojek officers storm the theater. They all have their swords drawn and you guys are held at bladepoint as they start demanding explanations for whatever the hell just happened here. You see the two wojek officers from last night's murder scene are among them and you hear that all-too-familiar sigh of disappointment that is starting to follow you guys wherever you go this weekend. There is nothing like the professional courtesy that Jeau gave you after your tavern brawl. In fact, the wojek are a rather mean-spirited bunch. Zenia, the wojek officer, the female from last night who was talking to Elazia with you, sees you right away, and the moment she spots, you she storms over to you, grabs you, puts you in manacles and you are led away from the rest of the group. For reasons I'm sure you understand based on the note I gave you. As for the rest of you, you see your Izzet companion just sort of taken away, zero explanation, and you are practically pushed all the way back to the barracks to be confronted once again by Captain Farland. Captain Farland is even more distressed then you saw two days ago as the final hours of the festival draw to a close. He is just leering at you from under his brow and takes every other breath to try and figure out whether or not he should just string you up from the palisades. ""I cannot believe how stupid of an idea of this was. I have several dead Rakdos. I have an Izzet mage in custody. I have this Elazia woman who has been kidnapped, and now I have two disfigured and dismembered corpses. Why exactly should I be happy about this?""
Ned 48:08
Because there aren't four?
Brian 48:11
He, he gives you a really dirty look. ""I was not aware the Selesnya had such a smart mouth.""
Ned 48:20
They don't like me much for that.
Brian 48:21
""Would someone, by the angels' grace, explain to me why you marched into a Rakdos circus and murdered the lot of them?""
Eddie 48:31
""We discovered a dead body outside and heard a loud scream coming from inside.""
Brian 48:31
""And what about the man from the tavern?""
Eddie 48:40
""We found the rest of his parts inside the circus.""
Ned 48:43
And the person who screamed was the same woman who screamed when the first torso was discovered.
Brian 48:51
""I see. Well, this is a complicated matter. Still, it seems as if you did spend a great deal of effort trying to do what it is we agreed on. I, however, am in a difficult position. I'm embarrassed to say I am unable to keep up my end of the bargain. You see, the Azorius are on their way here. They caught word that one of their own is involved in this mess. I suspect they mean you, justicar. They will have authority once they arrive here and I will not be able to protect you from what is about to happen."" And his sentence kind of cuts off halfway through as he stares past you deep into the barracks and you hear a little bit of a commotion happening towards the door, and you see far Farland's eyes widen just a second before resetting into a stern gaze. And he speaks to you but not at you as he says, ""In fact, it looks like it's too late for you even now, because that is the Azorius maze runner.""
On the next Encounter Party! The Azorius authorities have entered the ring, taking an interest in the recent murders. Is Lennox Brightburne to blame? Will the courts be easier to manage than the military? And who is this mysterious Maze Runner? Find out on the next Encounter Party!

Last time on Encounter Party: Ravnica, the City of Guilds, prepares for the massive end of the year festival. The fates of five strangers are thrust together in the wake of a mysterious artifact, forced into a fight they did not provoke our players find themselves on the strange side of the law. The Boros Legion, a dangerous orb, all that and more this week on Encounter Party.
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to the Encounter Party. My name is Brian David Judkins. I am your Dungeon Master with me again are Andrew Krug, Eddie Cooper, Ned Donovan, Sarah Babe and Landree Fleming. Let's get started.
The barracks of the 34th Precinct is in stark contrast to the rest of the third district. Red and white banners of the Boros Legion hang off every tower and palisade. It looms over the district like a stern parent shaming the debauchery of the Theatre Row. There is no place for fun in the Boros Legion, an attitude made clear as you are all escorted inside.
Now you say that you have brought or at least recommended that your prisoner come with you.
Eddie 1:30
Absolutely.
Brian 1:31
You're confident he's somewhere within the barracks, but he's no longer within your custody. Well because you are currently under somebody else's custody. So this would be the workplace of your minotaur companion Fikarra Ordruun. The barracks itself is abuzz like a swarm of angry bees. There are dozens and dozens of legionnaires in every corner of the barracks. People are getting marshaled over in that corner, other people are managing documents over here; it is the, the hurried energy of a group of people getting ready for the busy festival weekend. You are herded through this crowd of legionnaires into a back office. In that office is an older man sitting behind a desk. He has a face like rough leather. He has the stubble of someone who just doesn't really bother shaving anymore. And Fikarra, you know, this is Captain Farland, who's the commanding officer of the 34th Precinct. Captain Farland is currently losing a staring contest with a piece of paper. And as the five of you are marshaled inside one of your escorts steps behind the desk to whisper something in his ear. With an absolutely defeated and deflating sigh Captain Farland looks up and addresses the five of you: ""Oh great. This is exactly what I need. Let me guess, did someone spill your drink? Or perhaps they said something nasty about your mother?""
Andrew 2:49
""They actually kidnapped a local who had brought in a cursed enchanted item but, please, by all means, denigrate us some more.""
Brian 3:00
""Yes, sit in the middle of a barracks and tell me exactly how my attitude should be. And you, Private Fikarra, what do you have to say on this matter?""
Sarah 3:09
""Sir? In order to protect property damage and to de-escalate the situation, we decided
Ned 3:15
Escalated the situation
Sarah 3:16
""to attack the person that was there and the rest of people left, they mentioned Mr. Alfonso--""
Brian 3:21
""I don't have time for this!""
""I have the festival starting tomorrow and I'm certainly not keen on feeling my jail cells before the day even begins. Now, what am I to do with you?""
Sarah 3:23
""Yes sir.""
Ned 3:32
""I don't know. Probably your job.""
Brian 3:34
""Well, smartasses all around.""
Landree 3:37
Well, no, actually, ""Quite honestly, sir, I'd just like to go home if I could.""
Brian 3:42
""Mm-hmm. Well the problem here is that we have: public intoxication, a bar fight, assault, and you, justicar, should be extra ashamed of yourselves. Now--""
Eddie 3:53
""Ashamed? I tried to stop someone from being kidnapped, and you stand here mocking me.""
Brian 4:00
""I am trying to be as civil with this I possibly can. But I have every right to throw you in a jail cell until I find the time to bother coming to speak with you again.""
Ned 4:12
Typical Boros, just focusing on the wrong thing.
Sarah 4:15
""Sir. Yes, sir.""
Brian 4:16
Would everyone please make Charisma saving throws please4.?
Andrew 4:22
4.
Eddie 4:24
18.
Ned 4:24
A 19.
Landree 4:25
18.
Sarah 4:25
21.
Brian 4:26
Okay, well, you are probably fine. You're probably fine because this is your boss. Regardless, I would say this, Andrew: whatever is about to go down, might be better to just hope it ends quickly. And then, unless this involves actual physical confrontation or jail time, maybe just let this man stew out.
He has not managed to intimidate all of you physically. But it is very clear that you're going to have to wait for him to decide when this is over. However, your unfazed attitude does convince him that perhaps this isn't the best way to go about it. And as he kind of eyes the crowd, he starts again. ""Well, then, maybe this just happens to be your lucky day. I will offer you a deal. You can either work or you can rot. What will it be?""
Ned 5:18
Work what?
Brian 5:19
""The Festival of the Guildpact starts tomorrow. And as you can guess by my demeanor, it is my favorite time of year, when my entire battalion is garrisoned along the streets of the festival, having to protect the fair people of Ravnica from their drunken selves. The thing is that the bureaucrats of this city tend to forget that criminals tend not to commit crimes directly in the faces of legionnaires. A couple of plainclothes officers might do me a bit of good this weekend. So I offer you this. You work for me and keep the riffraff out of my hair for the next two days and I will commute your sentences. Otherwise, your payment is staying out of a jail cell. I have no problem keeping you on hold until the justicars come down and deal with this themselves.""
Andrew 6:06
The moodmark enchantments on Lorzatch's face flit into a reluctant configuration as his face blushes an autumnal yellow.
Brian 6:18
""This is not a very difficult thing to work out. You either putter around the festival for two days, get a little tough with the riffraff and the street punks, or you can spend the weekend in jail.
Eddie 6:30
Getting tough with the riffraff and street punks is my job.
Brian 6:34
""Glad to hear it. And you, Private Fikarra, don't really have a choice.""
Sarah 6:39
""No sir. Yes sir. Sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. Sir.""
Brian 6:43
""Good Christ.""
I would like a verbal confirmation from each of you now. Please.
Eddie 6:53
""Done.""
Landree 6:53
""What?""
Ned 6:53
""Yeah, sure.""
Andrew 6:55
""Of course.""
Ned 6:56
It's nice shade of yellow, yo.
Brian 6:58
""I'm not expecting an Izzet scientist to follow along anyway. So just line up with the rest of these clowns.""
Landree 7:04
""Okay.""
Brian 7:05
""And do puff your chests out like you're proud of yourself."" And as you guys line up in order perhaps--
Sarah 7:11
Oh, I do.
Brian 7:11
Taking example from Fikarra, a Boros mage happens to walk in front of you and at each of your chests, he just kind of shoves a fist into your chest and it is hot, like red hot. And as he pulls it away, you see a small Boros sigil, a glyph that just sort of like flickers and flames above your chest. It is the red sunlit fist of the Boros Legion. And he says, as he's kind of talking about it, it slowly flickers away just as much as he says, ""If you get into trouble, tap your breast and the sigil will alight. You now work for the Boros this weekend. I don't care what your guilds are. I don't care what your past is. And I don't care where your allegiances lie. Your job this weekend is to keep the nonsense out of my hair, and I will keep the nonsense out of yours. Is that understood?""
Sarah 8:03
""Sir, yes, sir.""
Ned 8:04
""Yeah!""
Brian 8:04
""Private Fikarra.""
Sarah 8:05
""Yes, sir.""
Brian 8:06
""You are hereby demoted to Hazda for the entirety of the festival. You will not enjoy the privileges or the help of your fellow legionnaires. Your job is to marshal this civilian militia. And do not disappoint me.""
Sarah 8:22
""Sir. Yes, sir.""
Brian 8:24
""Now get out of my office."" And you guys kind of get forcibly shoved out onto the streets.
Landree 8:32
""Alright, okay, I'm going.""
Andrew 8:33
Lorzatch's face blushes a deep indigo into purple, into cyan, and then fades back to its jaundiced yellow.
Sarah 8:42
""Why are you changing colors?""
Andrew 8:43
""It's a condition.""
Sarah 8:45
""Like a good condition?""
Andrew 8:47
""Sure.""
Ned 8:48
""Does it, does it mean anything? Can you do it by choice?""
Andrew 8:50
""Yes.""
Sarah 8:50
""Can you do patterns?""
Brian 8:52
Is this part, is this part of your personal character? Or is this a Devkarin trait?
Andrew 8:57
This is personal.
Brian 8:59
It's a personal thing.
Landree 9:00
""I'd just like to say that I second your face colors.""
Ned 9:05
What is happening?
Sarah 9:07
""Well, I got demoted because of you people.""
Brian 9:11
Temporarily.
Ned 9:12
""I got a really interesting story because of you people. Really in here.""
Andrew 9:12
Lorzatch, as soon as he is outside of the barracks, covers the Boros insignia with a ragged stole scarf thing that he's thrown across his neck.
Brian 9:26
As you kind of start rubbing it over yourself and inadvertently touching the area at the same time, you realize that the glyph is actually up off of your chest in a hovering way, so no matter how much you try and cover it, it still kind of glows over in the front and after a moment it sort of dissipates again.
Sarah 9:43
""It won't be covered up.""
Eddie 9:45
""I don't know about all of you. But I'm planning on getting to the bottom of what this is."" I'm not holding it barehanded.
Brian 9:51
Not holding it barehanded.
Eddie 9:56
I wrap it--
Brian 9:56
I would love to continually make you take chill damage.
Every time you're like, 'where's the thing, it's right here, oh no!'
Eddie 10:04
'Ah shit!'
Brian 10:06
'Fooled again!'
Landree 10:07
Zenia is smitten by the orb, so as soon as he brings it out, her eyes just go straight, she is, she's with you.
Eddie 10:14
""I can see you're intrigued, sorcerer.""
Landree 10:17
""Yes.""
Eddie 10:20
""Then join me.""
Landree 10:21
""Okay.""
Sarah 10:22
Well, we can still patrol everything. I mean, we need to patrol everything or they're going to put us back into the barracks.
Brian 10:28
As of tomorrow morning you are on duty.
Sarah 10:30
Tomorrow morning.
Brian 10:31
Tomorrow morning. It is now evening.
Sarah 10:33
Oh.
Brian 10:34
Supper time.
Sarah 10:35
So we've got, like, a little bit of time.
Brian 10:37
A little bit of time.
So you find your way back to the Leg End, the only place this still has open rooms this close to the festival's day. Dodgy looks very nonplussed to see you. But he offers you rooms to stay for the night, at the cost of 200 zibs per night. You have the breadth of rooms available to you, every one of them is open except for the one all the way down the line. You can partner up as you wish, if you wish to stay together for any reason, but there are five of you. And there are only three rooms available. So please divvy yourselves out as you wish.
Landree 11:14
""I'd like to stay with the orb. Please.""
Eddie 11:16
""I'll allow it.""
Sarah 11:17
""So, three of us, right?"" In the second room?""
Landree 11:17
""Thank you.""
Andrew 11:21
""Fine.""
Ned 11:22
""Yeah, alright.""
Sarah 11:22
All right.
Brian 11:24
So please, please make a note as to where your gear would be located for the following day. And then everybody gets a nice long rest.
The following morning. Eventually you're all rousted by the sounds of an excited city. It's the last day of the year and the first day of the Festival of the Guildpact. Each of your sigils are agitated at some point during your dressing, reminding you of your misfortune. But you do muster yourselves eventually and head out into the row. What you're met with is an overwhelming assault on each and every one of your senses. Sights, smells and sounds collapse on you from all sides. Every possible square inch is crammed full of concessions and trade booths. Three separate songs are playing at the same time, condensing into something that sounds more like a dying alms beast than anything else. Confetti chokes the air like ash and colors you didn't even know existed reflect the sunlight into every nook and cranny of the street.
Anywhere there is to stand, there is some goblin, human, Vedalken, or Loxodon expunging a year's worth of stress into one sporadic celebration. As you guys begin your patrol, would one of you please roll a D6?
Andrew 12:48
I will. Three.
Brian 12:51
Ah. A three. Give me a Perception check please.
Sarah 12:56
Everybody, or
Brian 12:57
No, just, just Lennox.
Eddie 13:01
I did not do well.
Brian 13:03
You did not do well.
Eddie 13:05
I rolled a three.
Brian 13:09
Would somebody else please roll another D6?
Ned 13:11
Yeah.
Eddie 13:11
So I keep walking down the street.
Brian 13:13
You keep walking down the street.
Okay, so you hear this really horrible aggravated argument happening between two people off to the side. On the side of the street. There are two people who have stands at the festival, side by side. One of them is this sort of craggly old lady who has a booth full of, like, kitschy items for sale. And then next to her is this sort of, like, horrid wrinkly old guy who is selling street food. He is vending street food. But upon closer inspection, it doesn't look very appetizing. Like he's not actually particularly good at making whatever it is that he's selling and they are in it, after each other. The old guys accusing her, ""You ruined my food! You ruined my food. This--""
And she's like, ""I didn't do nothing, you don't blah blah blah, get your face, get your ugly face out of my face.""
Ned 14:03
Hello!
Brian 14:05
They both turn to you at the same time. ""What?""
Ned 14:07
So look, this here is a festival, and we have been deputized to deal with problems such as yourselves.
Sarah 14:16
I totally tap my Legion.
Ned 14:17
I don't really want to do this. I'd rather watch you duke it out and then tell you you were dumb for fighting in the first place, because it feels like you'd be taught an important lesson, but apparently I have responsibilities. So could you please stop.""
Brian 14:31
The kind of craggly man looks at you. He says, ""She released critters into my food!"" And she's like, ""I did no such thing! This man is a liar!""
Eddie 14:38
""Is there any proof that she unleashed critters in to your food?""
""It looks like your food has gone rancid.""
Brian 14:41
Oh, he like holds up some shit. And there's like bugs.
Andrew 14:46
I examine the bugs.
Brian 14:49
Please do, Devkarin.
Andrew 14:49
24.
Brian 14:50
Yes. Oh, I mean, yes, well, the Golgari would definitely know what the bugs are. You immediately recognize what these are. So they're called sugar beetles. In the undercity, the Devkarin elves probably have a different word for them. But up here, they're nicknamed sugar beetles and they set in right at the point where food starts to ferment or goes rancid. In the undercity, sugar beetles are used as an indicator on when it's time to give up on a crop. If sugar beetles set in, then the the crop as a whole is pretty much gone and needs to be completely uptoiled and, and sort of started again. So this is an indication that this food is not good.
Andrew 15:35
And it would be naturally occurring as opposed to introduced by a third party.
Brian 15:41
It would be naturally occurring.
Andrew 15:42
Lorzatch shares this information with the party.
Eddie 15:46
""Sir, your food has simply gone bad. You cannot blame this woman.""
Brian 15:51
So he just kind of, he just kind of scowls, and she feels incredibly victorious about the situation. She just goes, ""Ha, I know it! I told you! It's got nothing to do with me!""
Eddie 16:00
""Madam. Disperse now please.""
Brian 16:02
Well, she has a stand, she's not going to disperse. You can, she can sell the thing.
But we will, we will call this situation readily quarreled.
Eddie 16:06
""Go back to your stand.""
AD BREAK
Brian 16:47
One more D6 if you please.
Three. Please give me another Perception check. For Lennox.
Sarah 16:50
Three.
Landree 16:54
No whammies.
Eddie 16:55
Four.
Landree 17:00
Aw, you got a little bit of a whammy.
Ned 17:01
Do you not have any bonus on your Perception somewhere? Is it like a six at least?
Eddie 17:06
No, it's
Ned 17:07
Oh shit.
Brian 17:07
As you guys kind of continue, you do hear another ruckus. As you kind of look to your left, you can see down an alleyway that there is a small crowd of people who look like they're shoving somebody up against a wall.
Sarah 17:24
I'll go up and I kind of
Brian 17:26
There is a gang
Sarah 17:27
Okay
Brian 17:27
Of six young humans
Sarah 17:30
Okay
Brian 17:30
Who have a small goblin literally up off the ground pressed into the wall.
Sarah 17:37
""Drop the goblin! Now!""
Brian 17:39
They kind of look over at you pretty pissed off. ""Who the fuck are you?""
Sarah 17:43
I--
Brian 17:43
""Back off, bovine!""
Sarah 17:45
""Excuse me?""
Brian 17:47
""What, are your horns deaf?""
Andrew 17:48
They've done did it now.
Brian 17:50
They kind of like fan out, they kind of drop the goblin to the floor and they kind of fan out. There's like six of them. They're like
Sarah 17:56
""Excuse me, friends.""
Brian 17:57
They look like they get in fights, like they're not
Sarah 17:59
""Excuse me, friends, would you like to join me in...""
Eddie 18:01
So I walk up.
Sarah 18:01
""Beating the living hell out of these people?""
Brian 18:01
""Oh do we have, we have a Mad Cow?""
Sarah 18:07
Boom! I just charge directly for him.
Brian 18:12
Give me an attack roll.
Landree 18:13
Can we also get the age of these children, just so I know?
Brian 18:17
Street toughs. Old enough to know better.
Landree 18:21
There you go.
Sarah 18:22
That is going to be a 15.
Brian 18:23
A 15 will do it. Roll me some damage.
Sarah 18:25
Gladly.
Landree 18:26
If you murder a child...
Sarah 18:29
Five.
Brian 18:30
Okay, so please describe to me exactly what's happening here.
Sarah 18:33
I just go for this guy.
Brian 18:34
Headbutt? Punch?
Sarah 18:35
Probably a headbutt.
Brian 18:36
Probably a headbutt. So you just walk up to this punk, who is, like, up to your chin.
Sarah 18:42
Right.
Brian 18:42
And you just full-on headbutt him in the face.
Sarah 18:45
Yeah.
Brian 18:46
And he goes down, and they're like, ""Hey man, we didn't mean it! Uh, I'm sorry, man, ma'am, man-ma'am. I'm sorry."" And they kind of like collectively pick themselves up and just freakin book, like this is not, they they stepped, and got put in their place and they are out. And now you have this goblin.
Eddie 19:04
I walk up to the goblin. ""Are you all right?""
Brian 19:07
He goes, ""Oh, yes. Oh, thank you. Oh Skyx is so thankful for you. They were very mean. They were very mean to Skyx.""
Eddie 19:14
""Why were they attacking you?""
Brian 19:16
""Oh, because Skyx is a goblin. They're not very nice to goblin, no one's nice to goblins.""
Sarah 19:21
""Can we escort you someplace, sir?""
Brian 19:24
He says, ""Yes, I clean up one of the theaters in the area. I am just a push-broom.""
Sarah 19:30
""We'll come. We'll take you and make sure you get to your next place safely.""
Andrew 19:35
Lorzatch rolls a 15 for Insight against the goblin.
Ned 19:39
Yeah, yeah, I was about to ask the same damn thing.
Brian 19:41
You can also make an Insight check, that's fine. Um, he is not. He looks incredibly frightened. You get no sense that he's lying. He is some poor young goblin who has a menial job and these guys were pricks and probably were beating him up because he's an easy target.
Andrew 19:59
Lorzatch is satisfied and chooses to escort the goblin back to his place of business.
Brian 20:03
So you escort the young goblin back to his place of work in Theatre Row. It's a nice theater. It's one of the larger ones. Definitely sort of patroned by the Orzhov banks. It's a nice place. And Skyx very apologetically, ""Oh thank you. Thank you again, thank you so much,"" as he shuffles his way into the front entrance, unlikely to come back out during the remainder of the festival. Probably had enough fun. The rest of your afternoon is pretty event-free and mundane. There is a Selesnyan lyre trio that performs a concert out on the street and that kind of keeps everyone's attention for a while. Even though people don't really likes Selesnyan music out here, they're, they're booed pretty viciously. This is a, sort of a Rakdos part of town, but at least it keeps everyone in one place and kind of keeps their attention to prevent any more major mishaps for you. So as the afternoon comes to an end and supper time begins to set in. And as the festival sort of makes its way off the streets indoors for the night, you guys probably find that it's safe enough for you to return to the Leg End if you so desire.
Sarah 21:06
""Thank you for all of your help, friends.""
Ned 21:08
Is there any reason why we would not head back to the Leg End? I mean, I'd love to know what's going on with this sphere. Is the sphere in your possession or is this the sphere back at the Leg End?
Eddie 21:15
The sphere is in my possession.
Ned 21:17
Cool.
Brian 21:17
Please reach for your sphere.
Sarah 21:20
Oh no, oh no.
Eddie 21:22
With my cape.
Brian 21:24
Yes.
Eddie 21:26
I reach for my sphere.
Brian 21:28
As you go to grab your cape, you realize that there is like a slit in your cape. Now thankfully the orb is still there. But your coin course is gone.
Eddie 21:42
Curses!
Brian 21:43
Yeah.
Ned 21:44
Bad luck bro.
Brian 21:45
Very clearly a cutpurse has snuck by and snipped your purse.
Eddie 21:50
Stupid failed Perception check.
Brian 21:52
Yes. In fact, in fact, based on the rolls, a second one came by to steal it again, but it was already gone the first time, so he was just kind of disappointed. 'Aw, somebody got here before me.' 'Rats! Aw shucks!'
Ned 22:11
I'd love to go back to the Leg End, have some food, and maybe put this sphere on the table and just like try and make some decisions about it.
Brian 22:16
You guys heading back to the
Eddie 22:17
My coin purse has been stolen, I have no zips.
Ned 22:22
I got zibs, I'll help you out.
Brian 22:23
Where are we going? Are we heading back to the tavern?
Andrew 22:26
As long as we're all satisfied that this satisfies what the captain has asked of us and that we're not likely to incur any
Landree 22:37
Yeah, yeah, what time of day is it? Now.
Brian 22:40
It's towards the night. The festivals are kicking in. So it is New Year's night, so there is going to be New Year's activity but there also is nothing preventing any of that guard duty from happening at a bar.
Ned 22:54
Look we don't got anywhere else to go. I'm a big fan of the Leg End. Dodgy's cool. Let's go to the Leg End.
Eddie 22:58
Yes. Let's head back.
Brian 23:00
So you guys had back to the Leg End. You find yourself a table, we'll say out of privacy, if you would prefer to take the one in the back corner, you may.
Sarah 23:08
Yes.
Ned 23:10
I love that you have a favorite table.
Brian 23:13
Well this is, this is Fikarra's watering hole.
Sarah 23:16
I'm all about it.
Brian 23:17
This is a great place because the, I think the Boros enjoy drinking here because of the magic barriers. They don't have to deal with shit. So when shit happens, they're like, come on Fikarra, don't ruin the one place we can go to. There's a couple of interesting people that you notice inside the tavern. There is a Simic guild member sitting up at the table, Zenia, that you were sitting in just yesterday. She is funneling alcohol into a cytoplast-covered toad.
And taking a seemingly large amount of very strange notes as this toad begins to swell and swell and swell with all the fluid that she's pouring into it. The gang of punks that you saved Skyx from this afternoon are also inside the tavern. Looks like they found some place to celebrate the rest of their evening. They are drinking very heavily and being pretty belligerent about it. There is also a shrouded man sitting at the bar that everyone seems to be giving a lot of space to. He's trying not to make a scene but he continues to slam his face on the, uh, continues to slam his fist on the bar--
In between gulps. Yes. That is different. Very different. And then you also, yeah. And they're sort of right as you pass in that table, right in front of the door, there is a couple who looks like they're out having a great time until they start breaking out into a quarrel. The woman suddenly brandishes her steak knife as a weapon and it immediately flies out of her hand to the no-weapons-allowed wall. Unfortunately it does take the man's ear on the way.
Ned 24:29
Different.
I was gonna ask this question!
Brian 25:04
You see him scream in pain and hold his ears as you continue past. Maybe not worth your time.
Landree 25:12
Yeah, Zenia sees it and she giggles a little bit.
Brian 25:14
Yes.
Landree 25:14
And just keeps walking.
Andrew 25:16
Lorzatch will get involved and will roll Medicine to try and treat this man's ear.
Eddie 25:22
I will, I, yeah.
Andrew 25:23
24.
Brian 25:25
Yeah.
Ned 25:25
Jesus.
Brian 25:26
How would you like to help?
Andrew 25:27
Lorzatch will peel the severed ear from the wall and do his best to reattach it, applying Chill Touch selectively and using a fungal epoxy to sort of lacquer it back on.
Brian 25:44
Great.
Andrew 25:45
And as the filaments take root inside the man skin, it'll stitch back the tissues together and hopefully not grow gangrenous.
Brian 25:54
You do this very well. In fact, they're both really appreciative and even the, the woman is pretty mortified. And is like, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. I love you."" ""Oh, I love you too."" And it quickly becomes sickening to the point that you may have regretted helping in the first place.
Eddie 26:10
I consider arresting her for assault. But then I don't.
Brian 26:14
She didn't.
Andrew 26:15
Lorzatch will sidle up and point out to either the justicar or the Selesnyan that a shrouded man is sitting at the bar, and there was a particular shrouded the man who had been kidnapped quite forcefully sometime earlier, but having not seen his face, Lorzatch can't identify him and would instead suggest that one or both of them check that shit out.
Brian 26:40
Okay.
Ned 26:41
This is a very good point. I was distracted by the filling of a toad with alcohol. I think that's an important
Andrew 26:47
Ah, excuse me.
Landree 26:49
As do I, Brevin, thank you.
Ned 26:51
But I agree with you, I should stop looking at the toad.
Andrew 26:53
As people of science, we are of course obligated to follow up.
Landree 26:57
Obviously, yes.
Ned 26:57
You check out the toad, I'll check out the shrouded figure.
Andrew 27:00
Agreed.
Ned 27:01
Report back.
Brian 27:02
Okay.
Ned 27:02
I need to know.
Brian 27:03
You approach the shrouded figure.
Ned 27:06
The shrouded figure. I'm not going to the shrouded figure, I'm going to try and get a vantage point that I can see the shadow figure, so I'm looking at this bar, I'm, is, I'm going to the other corner from where the shrouded figure is to try and see across the bar and see if I can gather any information.
Brian 27:20
As you approach the shrouded figure, he seems to have calmed down a great deal. In fact, he's actually perfectly still now. As you're kind of looking in, you see Dodgy just sort of lightly saunter down the bar and just gently remove the guy's mug from in front of him with zero effort whatsoever. That action alone is enough to tilt this guy off the back end of his barstool and he lands on his back with a thud, still perfectly in shape like a dead beetle in sitting position. His cloak falls back from his face and his clothing a little bit, you can see he's actually an Orzhov guild member who's wearing some really nice kind of expensive clothes underneath, probably covering himself up because this place is probably well below his station, so what he's doing in here, I don't know, why he's drinking in such a low brow place, I don't know, but for right now he is stone cold out.
Ned 28:16
Drunk? From drink?
Brian 28:17
Yeah.
Ned 28:18
Okay.
Brian 28:18
Yeah.
Ned 28:18
We're not saying like, dude got poisoned.
Brian 28:20
Dodgy kind of looked at him and goes, ""I told him not to try this. This celebration special. It gets the weak ones every time.""
Ned 28:27
""Hey Dodgy, one celebration special please.""
Brian 28:31
""You got it. 20 zibs, my friend.""
Ned 28:33
Abso-damn-lutely.
Brian 28:35
Give me a Constitution check, please.
Ned 28:38
17.
Brian 28:39
It's delicious.
Ned 28:40
Yeah!
Brian 28:41
As for the Simic with the toad,
Landree 28:43
Yes.
Brian 28:44
Yes, she is Vedalken. Looks pretty uppity. Just sort of sitting there as she kind of pours a little bit into this toad. He sits with his mouth open and then she kind of pours a little bit and then writes down some notes and kind of stares again and pours a little bit into it.
Landree 28:59
""I hate to interrupt any kind of scientific endeavor, uh, but at this point, miss, it looks like you're torturing the toad.""
Andrew 29:09
I was simply going to ask what variable it is that you're testing.
Landree 29:13
""Ah, good question.""
Brian 29:15
She says, ""Ah, well, it is not torture yet until the point of explosion, at which point I would imagine would take about another two ounces, I would step back if I were you, briefly."" And she pours the remaining liquid of whatever this is that she's been feeding this toad. And this amphibian who was enjoying a brief moment of unexpected intoxication very quickly hits a moment where his eyes bulge and he realizes, 'Oh, perhaps this is a bit too much fluid,' and he just sort of bursts all over the table. The Vedalken gets a bunch of sort of frog juice on her notepad, of which she doesn't seem to be bothered by it and just to herself, ""Hmm. Not as much as you would expect."" And kinda continues just to going back and writing her notes. While you were all engaging who you are engaging with, there is a blood-curdling horrific scream that comes from upstairs that could have come from any of your rooms.
Eddie 30:14
I run upstairs.
Brian 30:15
You run upstairs.
Andrew 30:16
Lorzatch is not far behind.
Brian 30:17
Not far behind.
Sarah 30:19
I'm going too.
Brian 30:21
Okay.
Landree 30:21
Zenia didn't notice the scream, but she does see him, Lorzatch, run away, so she follows him.
Ned 30:27
I'm gonna make sure that
Brian 30:28
You are probably the closest to the stairs. If you're at the bar, you were the closest to the stairs.
Ned 30:33
Well then I should go up first. If I'm not the first one up, then yeah, I run up.
No, because I'm not gonna let people go by. If they went up first, I'd like hang out and make sure we were good down here.
Brian 30:37
You don't have to, you can wait.
Andrew 30:42
Yeah, I mean, do I get free refills?
Brian 30:46
No. It is enough that the whole bar is kind of stopped. It's that loud.
Ned 30:50
My instinct would be that, like, the last person up should hang out at the bottom of stairs and make sure nothing happens down here, given that there's a scream, but I would run up.
Sarah 30:56
I would actually like to go to the door.
Brian 30:58
To the, to the front door.
Sarah 30:59
Yeah, to kind of, like, lock down the place.
Brian 31:01
Sure.
Sarah 31:02
And see if that, make sure nobody can leave.
Brian 31:03
Sure. Give me some type of Intimidation or Persuasion check.
Sarah 31:09
Intimidation or Persuasion, you say.
Brian 31:11
Oh yes, the Boros minotaur, proficient maybe?
Sarah 31:15
That's going to be a 19.
Brian 31:17
Great. You get to the door and are like, 'Don't.'
'Any of you thinking about getting out of here, don't.' And everybody just kind of sits still and it's like, 'oh this night just got really bad didn't it?' Those of you who run upstairs, you realize that the scream, as you kind of very quickly hunt door, door, door, you realize the scream came from the very, very end of the hall, that one room that was already occupied by the time that you goes in there. As you open the door. Ned, you are first in line?
Ned 31:48
Yeah.
Brian 31:48
Please give me a Constitution saving check.
Ned 31:52
19.
Brian 31:53
Great. For whatever reason, you are not horrified by what it is that you see inside.
Ned 31:58
Which is?
Brian 31:58
There is, for the those of you running up to the door, there is a woman on the ground screaming, continuously screaming, staring at the bed. On the bed is a torso and nothing else except for some blood on the floor. No arms, no legs, no head.
Sarah 32:17
Just ''tis a flesh wound.'
Eddie 32:18
Male or female?
Brian 32:20
Male.
Andrew 32:20
Lorzatch rolls a 15 to examine the torso.
Brian 32:25
Okay, you examine the torso. There is a woman screaming. I will, I will say you're going to need to make a disadvantage check while this woman is screaming.
Andrew 32:36
Still a 15.
Brian 32:37
Still a 15. Okay, what you notice is that all five limbs have been cut off cleanly, to such an extent that perhaps it's curious how someone was even able to dismantle five limbs quite so efficiently.
Andrew 32:50
And is there any sign of decay setting in?
Brian 32:54
There is no sign of decay.
Andrew 32:56
It's very fresh, including the blood.
Brian 32:58
This man was just murdered.
Andrew 33:00
Just murdered and...
Ned 33:02
By the woman?
Andrew 33:03
All limbs...
Eddie 33:04
Are the windows open?
Andrew 33:05
Removed. Decapitated, likely post-mortem, given how cleanly the cuts were made. And there is no sign of any of the limbs nor the head in this room.
Eddie 33:15
I go to the woman.
Brian 33:16
Yes.
Eddie 33:17
""Madam, what did you see? What's happened here?""
Brian 33:18
She is so completely horrified. She's very unresponsive. [stammering]
Damn it. No. Okay. Okay, so you slap her but it doesn't like, it just--
Eddie 33:31
[slapping noise]
Landree 33:36
That is Lennox's fault.
Andrew 33:37
We're, we're going with that? We're going with that? It's not, like, an Airplane reference. We're just gonna full-on do this.
Ned 33:43
No, we are leaning in to it.
Andrew 33:43
Alright. This is the podcast, folks, strap in.
Brian 33:49
'I had to stop her from screaming.'
Right, now it doesn't really quell her it just kind of make sure at least acknowledge that you are there.
Eddie 34:03
Uh huh.
Brian 34:03
And she kind of converts her hysteria from like just the nether into like you, and she's kind of grabbing at you like: [stammering]
Landree 34:12
While, while he's talk, trying to talk to her, Zenia just kind of creeps up and she's trying to, she's like, humming to herself under her breath trying to match the pitch the scream.
And while she's doing this, she's kind of looking all over this woman, like, clothes, maybe, like, picking up a pocket. This woman doesn't seem to be paying attention and Zenia is not polite. So she's going to
Brian 34:39
She's completely uninjured.
Landree 34:44
Okay. Okay.
Brian 34:44
There is not a speck of blood on her. As far as her things, give me a Sleight of Hand check, please.
Landree 34:54
Aha, lucky for me...
Brian 34:56
Oh no. That's one thing DMs don't want to hear, 'Oh, lucky for me, which means unlucky for you...'
Landree 35:04
Well, I mean, I got a little too cocky. But I got a 13.
Brian 35:10
I think, I think a 13 is enough to do it. But I think at the point where she now kind of acknowledges you doing a thing. And she's now kind of grabbed both of your clothing. And he's just sort of shaking and stammering and screaming.
Landree 35:26
But did I find anything?
Brian 35:28
You did not have the opportunity to remove anything because she immediately is like, she doesn't seem mad at you that you were rifling through her things. But she at least knows that you're there and is now trying to engage with you.
Andrew 35:38
Lorzatch rolls either--
Brian 35:40
Yes.
Andrew 35:41
A 19 for herbalism.
Brian 35:44
Okay.
Andrew 35:45
Or a 22 for Medicine to try and treat this woman's...
Ned 35:50
Hysteria?
Andrew 35:51
Condition, please.
Sarah 35:55
Outward anxiety.
Andrew 35:56
Shock, alarm.
Brian 35:58
Shock and alarm.
Andrew 35:59
Trauma. It's legitimate.
Landree 36:02
That's considerate.
Ned 36:02
I would feel like those have synonymous...
Brian 36:04
Yeah, so herbalism. Do you have any medicinal herbs on you?
Andrew 36:11
Well, he has an herbalism kit.
Brian 36:13
Right.
Andrew 36:14
Which suggests that...
Brian 36:15
Which is more of a...
Andrew 36:17
Different than having medicinal herbs.
Brian 36:18
It's different than, sort of, like...
Ned 36:19
It's the means to use herbs.
Eddie 36:19
It's like a mortar and pestle and stuff.
Brian 36:23
Herbalism kits are great for like Survival checks, things out in the wilderness, providing food and things like that. But as far as a direct medical connotation without something sort of established...
Andrew 36:32
I, I roll a 19 to smoke this lady down. No. Uh...
22 with Medicine to try and calm her, if Medicine could apply.
Brian 36:45
I'm going to struggle here to figure out a way that you could do this. Let's say that you at least find a way to prevent her hyperventilation.
Eddie 36:54
I gently stroke her back.
Brian 36:55
But it is very clear that whatever is affecting her is mental trauma. She is not physically hurt at all.
Eddie 37:04
I gently stroke her hair.
Brian 37:06
Yes.
Eddie 37:07
And I whisper in her ear. ""You're safe. We are here to help. What have you seen in this room?""
Brian 37:13
Give me Persuasion.
Eddie 37:16
'Lucky for me...'
Brian 37:19
Oh no.
Eddie 37:20
12.
Brian 37:21
I think you guys have managed to get this woman to a point where she is not going to be a danger to herself. But as far as whatever has afflicted her mentally, it's really beyond anything outside of some sort of medical profession or magical stopping.
Landree 37:37
Is she still holding on to me?
Brian 37:39
She is still pretty much grasped to you as if in a way that she does not want to be left alone.
Landree 37:44
Oh, okay. I was going to tickle her. But if it's comforting to her to be there, then sure.
No, no, Landree wouldn't, but Zenia would. Zenia still tickles her to try and get her to let go.
Brian 37:53
Oh god, it's, I don't think she's ticklish right now. I think she's too, I think she kind of looks at you like 'something serious has happened, woman!'
Eddie 38:00
I cast Heroism.
Brian 38:03
Ah, and what will hear Heroism do in this particular situation, please.
Eddie 38:07
A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the spell ends the creature is immune to being frightened.
Landree 38:14
Nice!
Eddie 38:14
And gains temporary hit points equal to my spell casting ability modifier.
Brian 38:18
Great. So you manage to calm her down to the point. She is brave. But it is not sort of just a magical like, 'oh, haha, this does not bother me anymore.' She is really messed up. But she at least has the wherewithal to at least converse with you.
Eddie 38:35
""Madam. Again. What have you seen in this room?""
Brian 38:43
""There was, there was, it was a man. And somebody came and, and cut him. And, and they threw me in the corner and they told me not to move. And I covered my eyes and I couldn't see and I heard a horrible noise.""
Eddie 38:59
""I need you to try and remember what this man looked like.""
Brian 39:03
She said, ""It was dark. And he was laughing. And he came at me so fast. I don't remember it very much. I just remember he was laughing. This was very funny to him. And the minute he shoved me into the corner, I didn't know what was going to happen. I looked away and I didn't open my eyes until I heard the window break.""
Ned 39:23
""What were you doing in the room?""
Brian 39:27
She seems unwilling to discuss that.
Eddie 39:30
""Who is this man? Who was he? Did you know him?""
Brian 39:32
She says, she says, ""I don't know.""
Eddie 39:34
""Where did you meet him?""
Brian 39:35
I'm sorry. You rifled through her clothing?
Landree 39:38
I did.
Brian 39:40
We have our first private note of the session.
Landree 39:43
Yes!
Brian 39:47
You did actually, you were not able to retrieve it from her body. But you did spot what I have just handed on to that piece of paper. For those of you listening at home, Landree has found two very important indicating items. One, the woman in question has an Azorius guild signet on her person, and two, she has some sort of plug attached to her chest. So she claims that she has just met this man, she does not know his name, and that somebody attacked them. And she says, 'I don't know who he was. He shoved me in the corner and I didn't open my eyes again until I heard the window break.'
Andrew 40:25
Lorzatch moves to the window.
Brian 40:27
There is a broken window.
Ned 40:28
Can I examine to see, examine to see if the window was broken by, like, an object or if they jumped through the window and it's like a stereotypical, like they're busting through with their shoulder. Right. I want to know, like roughly the size of the human we're dealing with.
Andrew 40:41
Lorzatch rolls at 20.
Lorzatch rolls a natural 20 so...
Ned 40:47
Great talk.
Brian 40:47
Certain things you find about the room: number one, there is a broken window. Notably, all of the glass is outside the window, suggesting that it was broken from the inside. Attached to the window, stuck on one of the pieces of broken glass is a piece of fabric. The fabric looks like it could be a part of a black and red checkered pattern. Onto the body, all of the cuts were made with extreme precision, okay, very clean, very knowledgeable, like quartering a chicken.
Not necessarily one stroke, but whoever or whatever did this knows how to disassemble a body in the quickest and most efficient way possible. This is a practiced maneuver. While those of you upstairs are investigating this murder scene, Fikarra, down at the front door you see two people stand up from a table over in the opposite end of the tavern where you guys were sitting. They are in full Boros uniform, there are two of them, one male, one female, they have dark skin, white hair, and they are dressed in a wojek uniform. Now, the wojek are the Boros detectives, they're the investigators. They're the people who would be called anyway to deal with a murder scene. And it looks like they kind of sigh to each other, having resolved that there's no real way that they're going to avoid being a part of this situation. They look to you Fikarra at the door with this just extreme disappointment and make their way upstairs. So those of you who are upstairs quickly can see two wojek officers approach and ask what's going on.
Andrew 41:18
One stroke.
Eddie 42:23
I say, 'Please tell these men, or these people, what you've seen.'
Brian 42:27
And she does. She recounts the situation. And they're like, ""This is... okay. All right."" And the, the woman looks at the man and says, 'shoot you for who has to go,"" and he goes, 'ugh,' and they kind of throw a rock-paper-scissors, he loses, says, ""Fine, I'll go get a team,"" and then he starts heading his way out, asks you to let him out, and it's very clear that the Boros are going to go do their duty because this falls within their line. The, the woman on the floor does start talking to the wojek officer. For whatever reason, she seems much more comfortable talking to her. Perhaps you're not necessarily carrying the air of a justicar today. But the wojek does manage to get out of her that her name is Elazia and she simply recounts what's going on. And the, the wojek looks at you, Fikarra, and says, ""I heard we've got a new Hazda soldier kicking around the barracks. I'm not technically on duty today. But you are, and as far as I'm concerned, this is your mess. So, uh, until Studi gets back, I don't really want to be bothered by this. But as soon as the med team arrives, I have work to do on my hand. So..."" And she just kind of leans back against the railing, kind of folds her arms.
Andrew 43:50
""This is your district?""
Brian 43:51
""It's all our district. Oh, right. Undercity. Up here, we have laws and rules in areas where we patrol and protects them so that lawless craziness just doesn't run around wherever we feel like.""
Ned 44:08
""Yet still there is a disembodied torso.""
Andrew 44:10
""What Rak, what Rakdos performers do you know in the area?"" He holds up the red and black checkered cloth.
Brian 44:18
She looks and she's like, 'you're kidding, right?' ""Sorry. Undercity. This is Theatre Row. 90% of what you see is Rakdos.""
Andrew 44:26
""Any of them moonlight as butchers?""
Brian 44:29
""Are you serious? The Cult of Rakdos, a cult that warships a demon named Rakdos, who somehow was allowed to be a guild leader? They're masochists, who worship a nihilist, in the theater district!""
Landree 44:45
While everyone else is distracted, I'd like to quietly go up to the woman and just say, ""I feel like you're not telling me the full story.""
Brian 44:54
Persuasion check please.
Landree 44:56
15.
Brian 44:58
She kind of looks at you and says, ""What makes you say that?""
Landree 45:02
""Between you and I? I just want you to know, while you were very distracted, I did a quick search. So.""
Brian 45:10
""So? Did you see the torso lying on the bed?""
Landree 45:12
""I did see the--""
Brian 45:13
""You see this blood that we're sitting in?""
Landree 45:16
""Yes, I did see those things. There is a lot of blood. You're absolutely correct. And I'd love to look at it some more, a little bit later. But I found something on your person that you failed to mention to the group and I'm giving you the opportunity to talk with me about it right now.""
Brian 45:33
She's a little standoffish as in, like, ""What are you talking about? Don't you see what has happened to me?""
Landree 45:41
I just reach my hand and I touch where I found the object.
Brian 45:50
Okay, so she just kind of looks at you and just very gently...
Landree 45:56
Okay, so she shakes her head at me.
Brian 46:00
Yes.
Landree 46:00
And I, obviously I pick up on this and, and as Zenia very quickly goes, ""Blood!"" And she walks over to the torso.
Brian 46:09
Okay, you guys have a very brief period of time before a Boros medical team comes to start, you know, ascertaining if this guy's dead or not.
Eddie 46:17
Are there signs of a struggle in the room?
Brian 46:19
No. Again, it is sort of frightening how clean this was. In fact, the only thing dirty about it is the fact that somebody left through a window.
Ned 46:28
Is it clear how they got in? Did they come in through the door?
Brian 46:30
Great question. It's not clear. The important thing to note is the window is locked. But it is broken. It was an exit.
Ned 46:39
I would love to take a take a brief hiatus back downstairs and ask Dodgy who was in the room? Who signed it out? Do we have a ledger?
Brian 46:46
Yeah.
Andrew 46:46
That's pretty good.
Brian 46:47
Yeah. Okay, so you go down and you talk to Dodgy.
And Dodgy's like, ""What is going on? And why is it every time you're in my bar, something's going wrong?""
Ned 46:51
Yup.
""To be clear, we protected you last time so...""
Brian 46:59
""Fair enough.""
Ned 47:00
It's like a, we're at like a one-and-one here.
Brian 47:03
""Do I want to go up there?""
Ned 47:04
""No.""
Brian 47:06
""Bugger.""
Ned 47:07
""You should wait for the Boros team. Now--""
Brian 47:11
""I hate the festival.""
Ned 47:12
""Up there is a situation involving one of your tenants.""
""Who has the room at the end of the hall?""
Brian 47:17
""Okay.""
""He's the man at the end of the hall.""
Ned 47:22
""Do you not keep a ledger?""
Brian 47:23
""I do keep a ledger. Why?""
Ned 47:25
""Because I would like to know who is in the room at the end of the hall.""
Brian 47:26
""Why? What has happened to the man at the end of the hall?""
Ned 47:30
""Do you want to create a scene downstairs?""
Brian 47:32
""What has happened to the man?""
Ned 47:34
""So there's a situation upstairs.""
Brian 47:35
""Yes, you've already said that.""
Ned 47:37
""Yes. There's a lot of blood.""
Brian 47:39
""Oh.""
Ned 47:40
""The, the man of the end of the hall is unrecognizable or identifiable.""
Brian 47:43
""Ugh.""
Ned 47:44
""And we very kindly need you to do either of those things for us.""
Brian 47:49
""I'm not going up there. I've got a crowd full of people down here who are really upset.""
Ned 47:54
""I just told you that you didn't have to go up there. I just need you--""
""The name in the ledger!""
Brian 47:56
""What do you want from me then?""
So you kind of, he kind of takes a second. People are clearly in the room like, 'What's going on? What's going on?' ""Shut it!"" He kind of goes down, he looks at his ledger like, ""A man came in. A Mr. Caleb. Rented the room for the weekend.""
Ned 48:13
""First name or last name?""
Brian 48:14
""That's it. It's just a Mr. Caleb.""
Ned 48:16
""You have a terrible ledger.""
Eddie 48:18
I'd like to ask--
Brian 48:18
""How many names does a man need?""
Ned 48:20
That's fair.
Brian 48:21
Yes.
Eddie 48:21
""The charm on your establishment for weapons?""
Brian 48:24
""Yes.""
Eddie 48:24
""Is it your entire establishment or just down here?""
Brian 48:29
""Yes, it's everywhere.""
Eddie 48:30
""In the rooms as well?""
Brian 48:31
""You're not allowed to use martial weapons in here. Otherwise things like this happen.""
Eddie 48:35
Well, that's interesting because there's a body with no arms and no legs and--
Ned 48:39
I was really trying to hold that information in.
Brian 48:47
He goes, ""Oh, Christ. Oh god. I hate the festival so much."" Yes?
Landree 48:53
I'd like to cast Detect Magic. I got an 18.
Brian 48:56
You got an 18 on Detect Magic. There is magic localized within the room.
Landree 49:03
Okay.
Brian 49:04
Of what it is...
Landree 49:06
I don't know.
Brian 49:06
Yeah.
Landree 49:07
Okay.
Brian 49:07
But there is something localized within the room. But whatever it is, you've never really smelled it before.
Landree 49:13
Okay.
Ned 49:14
If I go back upstairs and rejoin everyone in the room could I perform an Arcana check based on knowledge of lore to see if that's something I would be able to recognize?
Brian 49:22
Yes, please.
Ned 49:22
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo 17.
Brian 49:26
Whatever this was, in your experience, was not done magically. This was precision dismemberment. Somebody very easily got in here, subdued someone, cut up one of the two people in here, and then left through the window.
Ned 49:42
Can I ask Elazia how long in your memory was it from the time that the, that the person entered the room to the time that they left by the window?
Brian 49:53
She says, ""I screamed as soon as he shoved me in the corner.""
Andrew 49:57
So this happened, if that's true, within less than five seconds.
If this is true.
Ned 50:02
Yeah, talking a 10-seconds surgical dismemberment.
If that's true.
Brian 50:06
This woman's story, which she ascertains is true, is that somebody came into the room. She does not know how they came into the room. She doesn't necessarily confirm or deny that the door was locked. It's not her room. Entered the room. In the moment when her and the other man realized that person was there. She was put into the corner and told to stay there. She closed her eyes, screamed, heard the person leave through the window, and then when she woke up--
Ned 50:34
So the scream was not related to the torso and the blood. The screen was from a push to the corner.
Brian 50:38
The scream was when he put her in the corner and it is very unlikely anyone heard the breaking of the window because she screamed. By this point the Boros team has arrived and the wojek officers officially take over the crime scene for the time being. The five of you are ushered back to your rooms for the night. And you get to think about how horrible of a day this has been. Lennox, for a second night in a row you find it difficult to fall asleep as you have this dangerous orb pressed against your side. Zenia, you mull over the items that you found on Elazia's person and wonder what that could possibly signify. And above all, the five of you lay awake in your beds commiserating over the fact that this was only day one of your sentence and how much worse it could possibly get tomorrow.
Next time on Encounter Party! Day two of the festival brings even more terror as the murder investigation takes a horrible turn. Will the players solve it in time or will Captain Farlan revoke his agreement? Find out on the next Encounter Party!

Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first episode of Encounter Party, an audio adventure governed by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. My name is Brian David Judkins and I will be your Dungeon Master for this story. With me are five professional actors and comedians from across the country who will help me spin this tale. But before we get to any introductions, first, I would like to welcome you to the world of Ravnica. Originally conceived by the card game Magic: the Gathering, Ravnica is a realm made up entirely of one massive sprawling cityscape. Vying for power are 10 unique guilds, each who control vital aspects of Ravnican life. Thankfully, their feuds are kept in check by an enchantment known as the Guildpact: a magical treaty that protects the city from all-out guild war. The end of every Ravnican year is punctuated by a two-day festival known as the Celebration of the Guildpact, where the fair people of Ravnica give thanks for their continued peacetime. Our story
takes place the day before the festival in the Third District of Ravnica, 34th Precinct, Theaters Row. Day workers labor non-stop to prepare the streets for the festival, as every part of this city becomes decorated from roof to gully in streamers, flags, tents and canopies. While every guild is represented, Theatre Row leans mostly towards the Orzhov banks and the nihilistic Rakdos cult. The cult's prominent red and black decoration barely covers the char of whatever recent deadly Rakdos performance the Orzhov banks have yet to replace. And although another year is ending in Ravnica, our story's just beginning. As I welcome the players to the table, ladies and gentlemen, let's get this party started.
Welcome, everybody. Let's get started. So, by tradition, you all meet at a tavern. But not just any tavern. This is a massive two-story ale house that is located on one of the prominent corners of Theatre Row. It is known to everyone as The Legend. Or at least it was, until a giant hit his head on the sign, splitting it in two. Now simply known as the Leg End, it has become a favorite watering hole for the Boros Legion, which is the military guild of Ravnica. The owner of the Leg End is a gruff, pot-bellied man everyone calls Dodgy on account of a bum leg that prevented him from enlisting in the Boros. However, his favor with that guild makes this a pretty hassle-free area for the military to hang out. The Leg End is a no-weapons-allowed establishment as notated by a large red sign above the door that says 'No Weapons Allowed.'
In fact, you can see on that wall that all of your martial weapons are actually sort of magnetized, attached to the wall. Dodgy explains to you if you are entering the joint for the first time that there is a magical barrier over the Leg End in which all martial weapons are seized by the front wall. And in fact, any objects or items whatsoever that a person attempts to use to physically harm another living creature while inside the Leg End will magically sort of zip out from their possession and fly and get stuck onto the wall. As Dodgy busies himself cleaning a few glasses he looks out over his tavern to see that there are a handful of people here for what we can call 'Happy Hour.'
Okay, so now let's meet the players. Let's go around the room ,describe our characters, give the audience a chance to meet you. Up first from the Golgari Swarm, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Andrew Krug who will be playing our elf druid.
Andrew 3:57
Sitting as a table against the wall, watching
the front door is Lorzatch Rot-Speaker, a Devkarin elf of the Golgari Swarm with the pale coloration and rough complexion of a people long used to laboring underground. His dark brown hair is matted, coiled into thick natural locks pull back from his face and tied with leather cord strung with beads of bone and scavenged glass, framed and pinned by a lattice work of bones. He wears robes of scavenged hide, an elaborate mantle of specially cultivated fungus forming a scalloped crust across his neck and shoulders. Beneath this coat of office he wears armor crafted from the cast-off moltings of goliaths and kraul. His alabaster visage is colored by discrete pockets of chromatophores, their otherworldly colors complementing and marring alike the shifting moodmark enchantments that frame his likeness. His eyes have a constant look of appraisal; cautious, appreciative and often amused.
Brian 4:58
From the Azorius Senate, Mr. Eddie Cooper, who will be playing our human cleric.
Eddie 5:06
Lennox Brightburne the Azorius human cleric stands tall at six foot three. He has dark black skin and long pristine dreadlocks, some of which are adorned with copper rings and blue and white beads. His
most recognizable feature is the lack of pigment going down the side of his left face, starting at his hairline, and ending just past his cheek. He wears heavy armor, painted blue and white and wields a shield and a mace. In the center of his shield is the symbol of his guild.
Brian 5:43
From the Selesnya Conclave, Mr. Ned Donovan who will be playing a human fighter.
Ned 5:50
At the bar, hunched over his Brevin Ravle, a Selesnyan fighter of some renown, who stands apart from a crowd. His tanned skin is covered completely with vine tattoos of a green so vivid you would call it luminescent if it actually glowed. As the vines creep around, up and over his neck and his skull, they come down his face and to his eyes where you find two unnatural green of the exact same hue. Wearing chain mail armor designed more for mobility than it is for defense, he sits with his drink peering around the bar, taking in everything, saying nothing, judging all.
Brian 6:34
Now from the Boros Legion herself, please let me introduce Sarah Babe, who will be playing our war drummer.
Sarah 6:42
In the corner of the tavern, sitting at a table, looking like she's been there many times before is Fikarra Ordruun. Fikarra is a minotaur of the Boros Legion. She wears her legionnaire armor with pride over her chestnut-colored skin. Her light blonde hair is styled in an impressive mohawk. Her maces and drum hang from her hips and only add to the pristine look of her armor. She has that certain shine to her eyes that lets you know she hasn't been in the Boros Legion for very long.
Brian 7:14
And lastly from the Izzet League, Landree Fleming, who will be playing a sorcerer of one of Ravnica's new races known as the Vedalken.
Landree 7:25
Alone at a table near the Leg End's door, chosen for no particular reason, you see Zenia the Vedalken of the Izzet Guild. Six foot tall, lean and lithe, young for a Vedalken at 41, with azure skin and violet eyes. She'd cut an imposing figure if she wasn't repeatedly rubbing her palms on her pants, attempting to generate static electricity. Absentmindedly she sips a glass of tepid water and if one passed closely enough to her table, one might overhear her muttering incoherently about conductive metals and the next predicted storm.
Brian 8:00
So as you are all sitting there, nursing your drinks, privately enjoying your happy hour, the front door to the tavern suddenly bursts open. And there's a man who stands in the doorway, pausing slightly as he was not expecting this many eyes to be looking upon him as he opened what he was hoping was probably an empty bar. What you can make out under his ragged robe is that he is a disheveled man; very unclean, unshaven, very nervous as he sort of classes around at all of you while trying not to make eye contact, and he sort of scrounges up to the bar like a mangy dog. He's going to squeeze his way into the bar between Lennox and Brevin. Fikarra, from your corner you would be able to see but you're not going to be able to hear too clearly. As for the other two of you, unfortunately his back is to you. Everyone can hear he's having a conversation with Dodgy and you can very easily hear Dodgy's half of the conversation but whatever the guy is speaking, he is trying to keep it quiet. Dodgy approaches the man with a casual annoyance: ""Oi, what'll you have?"" The man speaks tiredly: ""Something to drink. I'll take the whole bottle. Food if you have it."" ""You're too early for supper, all I got now is beer and a bit of bread."" The man says: ""That's fine. Anything."" And you see Dodgy zip to the back of the bar, pour a mug of ale, bring it back and a stale crust of bread. ""It's twenty zibs for the brew and the day-old's on me."" Those of you at the bar see this mongrel reach underneath his ragged cloak and pull out with a bare hand this perfect steel orb. Let's, all right, let's roll perception everybody to see kind of what we say about him. What do we get?

Great, I would say, Andrew, that you can see that he clearly has produced something from under his cloak. For the three of you except for Landree, unfortunately is hanging way back in the bar rubbing her legs for static electricity. He pulls out something shiny, the type of shine that he's actually trying to hide underneath the cloak so it doesn't immediately radiate out into the thing. But he presents it to the barkeep, he says, ""What is this?"" He says, ""It's valuable. Just take it."" ""Oi oi oi, I only deal in zibs and zinos, you pay coin or you don't drink."" He says, ""This thing's worth this whole entire place combined. It's fine. Just take it.""
Eddie 10:25
I take out coin and I throw a coin on the table. I say, ""I'll take that off your hands for you.""
Brian 10:32
He looks at you kind of over the cloak and one of the things that you can see is the reason why he may be hiding his face is he has like black vein tendrils, like some sort of infection that seem to be crawling up his neck. And he looks at you very angrily and very dirtily and says, ""This is not for you.""
Andrew 10:53
Can Lorzatch see any of that from where he is?
Brian 10:55
No, what you sense is a barkeep who is not happy with a patron that has sort of disturbed the peace of the tavern. And as you saw the man kind of walk in you wouldn't be able to see any of that vein, the veinage, veiniture, the veins.
But you would at least have the uneasy sense as everyone kind of walked in that this is a man who has been on the road. This, this is not a man of pristine character who just kind of walked in, he sort of like stumbled in and demanded some food.
Ned 11:26
I would like to know
Brian 11:27
You want to know whether or not you know what it is. At this point, based on your position, you would not be able to see his face, but you would be able to see, like, he clearly went in, they're having some sort of conversation, Dodgy is very easy to hear. He is not because he's talking very quietly.
Eddie 11:42
And what exactly is it, friend?
Brian 11:43
He says, ""It's none of your business.""
Ned 11:46
I believe you made it the business when you brought into the bar.
Brian 11:49
Make a Constitution saving throw, please.
Eddie 11:53
Oh, come on Constitution. 8.
Brian 11:57
An eight. You are severely intimidated. Whatever this is, this is not a casual conversation of like, 'Hey, you look like you're in trouble.' Whatever this is, is like, above your pay grade. This is not interesting. Ned, you did choose to engage briefly.
Ned 12:12
Yeah.
Brian 12:12
Please go.
Ned 12:13
'I believe you made it our business when you brought it to the bar. Now we're here trying to have a great drink and you're bringing your foully dark mood into this space and making us all exceedingly nervous. So I'm going to need you to get a drink, get some bread, drop a couple zibs, and stop talking about the creepy orb or talk exclusively about the creepy orb.'
Brian 12:33
So he turns to you.
Ned 12:34
Yeah.
Brian 12:35
With dagger eyes. He's even less pleased with you then he was with Eddie. Please give me a Constitution saving throw.
Ned 12:42
Nat 20.
Brian 12:45
Nat 20. Okay, you're not intimidated by whatever. This is a mangy dog. This is upsetting your day. The next two days of the festival you're either getting ready for it or trying to get your last day of safety in before the festival. And this just ain't happening. Before this man gets a chance to bark back at you, the front door pushes open violently and in walks a crowd of street tough looking guys at the head of them is a very, very large man, in just about every dimension you can imagine that word. On his face, he wears a massive grin. And he has a mustache that stretches out way past his cheeks in an absolute straight line. He also has goggles on his face, and he is wearing a half cloak. The other guys look to be not necessarily in uniform, but at least some sort of choreographed dress as if to make sure that they're all known to be a group traveling together.
Sarah 13:39
So like a boy band?
Brian 13:43
We'll say all black with maybe a red stripe somewhere.
Eddie 13:46
It's the theater district.
Brian 13:48
The theater district. It is the theater district.
Sarah 13:51
Oh boy.
Brian 13:51
So they turn to address the vagabond up at the bar. And the big guy in front is clearly the guy in charge. And he just sort of looks up and says, ""That is the face of a man who thought he had gotten away from us. We were just waiting to see where you were going. But this. This is just disappointing. Now, where is it?"" You see the mongrel sort of flusteredly, ""I don't have it."" And the large man sort of leans in with this, ""Oh yes you do. Mr. Alfonso is not going to be very happy about this."" Now as they kind of take a step in, all of their weapons, obviously, the the swords, the short swords, and the daggers that the guys are carrying all fly from their belts and stick to the wall. And the man kind of looks around and goes, ""Ah, magic barrier. That must be very expensive. But do not worry, barkeep, this is not a weapon."" And he pulls off his half cloak. And he has this massive mechanical arm, like about the size of a person and he simply pushes it out and launches it and it reaches out and grabs the vagabond like a vise grip and starts dragging it back towards him.
Sarah 15:11
Is it still attached to him?
Brian 15:13
Oh, yeah, it's like a grapple arm.
Sarah 15:14
Oh, so it's like arm, chain
Brian 15:17
Arm, cable.
Sarah 15:19
Oh, cable.
Brian 15:19
Body, claw. That is so big that it can wrap completely around the guys torso. Can I get Perception checks from the two of you at the bar.
Ned 15:31
Passive Perception or our actual perception?
Brian 15:32
Passive.
Eddie 15:34
Do I recognize that name?
Brian 15:36
Give me an Intelligence check.
Eddie 15:39
18
Brian 15:40
Yes, you know that Mr. Alfonso is a man of incredible wealth, but he is a very studious man who deals in objects. To your knowledge, he has no bad relationship with the law. He's not like a criminal in any regard. But he is a man who deals in things of a scholarly nature and is incredibly wealthy.
Ned 16:08
My passive Perception's 14.
Brian 16:10
Your passive Perception's a 14.
Eddie 16:11
13
Brian 16:13
At the moment, you are completely distracted by this man.
Eddie 16:18
So I stand up. And turn around and say, ""I'm sure Mr. Alfonso would not be so pleased with you coming in here and causing such a ruckus in his name.""
Ned 16:29
'And I believe that that was really aggressive, but this is not a place you fight. \
Eddie 16:37
And I show him my badge.
Brian 16:38
He kind of looks at you and he goes, ""Oh no, Azorius law dogs.""
Ned 16:44
I am no Azorius.
Brian 16:44
""Boys, why don't we help these fine folk forget we were even here.""
Let's roll Initiative.
Landree 16:57
Oh no.
Brian 16:57
Alright, so you've got some goons who look like they're rustled up for a bar fight. They are five in number, one per player. Conveniently. Lorzatch, as you are close to the door, there is one pretty close to you who looks like he's ready to try and come clobber you while you're still seated at the table.
Lorzatch takes one last sip of his wine and sets it back down on the table, flexing his open hand as his skin seems to grow thick, calloused, and leathery as these growths emerge from his knuckles over his fingers and turn into wicked sharp claws
Gross.
Andrew 17:33
As he approaches the nearest goon.
Brian 17:35
Okay.
That says natural 20
Andrew 17:43
And Lorzatch will roll
19 acid damage
Brian 17:49
Oh my god
Oh my god
Sarah 17:54
I'm just gonna walk out the back door, 'cause this guy's got it.
Brian 17:57
These guys were just looking to rough you up a little bit too keep you from mentioning about the events that happened here, but out of nowhere this undercity-dwelling Devkarin elf just sort of stands up from the bar with a lethal acidic hand and you just sear the face off of this guy who was completely unprepared. One of these goons just like drops down dead like in front of everybody. And there's this weird, like, 'did somebody just get murdered in the tavern, like, what happened?'
And so he is dead. Lennox, my Azorius police officer, you have just heard a nasty scream and watched a man get killed at the front door.
Eddie 18:36
So Lennox looks at the elf and says, ""I appreciate your intent. But please do not kill people in the tavern."" And he walks over
Brian 18:44
So cordial. 'Please don't murder.'
Eddie 18:48
And he casts Spare the Dying on the goon on the floor.
Brian 18:51
So the goon is no longer murdered, he is alive but he is unconscious and will be out of the fight. For those of you listening at home, there is no such thing as an official goon in the D&D Monster Manual. We're just using it as a derogatory term. We are in fact just using Bandit stats. But for the sake of the gameplay, we are calling them goons.
Eddie 19:14
If Lennox says you're a goon, you're a goon.
Brian 19:17
The law says you are a goon!
Andrew 19:21
Fikarra Ordruun.
Sarah 19:23
Okay.
Brian 19:24
Some people are messing up your favorite watering hole.
Sarah 19:28
Not in my tavern. Well Dodgy's. Not here. And just run at the nearest, the nearest goon.
Brian 19:38
Yeah.
Sarah 19:39
And I'm going to go with my horns right into them.
Brian 19:41
Oh, can you remind me how this works? So you like dash?
Sarah 19:44
Yeah.
Brian 19:45
At the end of a dash you can put down your horns and ran them with your horns because you're a minotaur. Love the new class.
Sarah 19:50
Yeah. I know, right? It's great.
Brian 19:51
Please go right ahead. This is fantastic.
Sarah 19:52
I'm super excited. Hopefully,
Brian 19:54
I have no attachment to these creatures I've made so please kill them, but don't kill them, no
It's our first natural one of the campaign. Would you please make a Constitution saving throw? Because I don't think you're looking at the line of sight of that tavern.
Sarah 20:14
You know, I may have had a few drinks. So it's very possible that is a, Constitution, you said? 13.
A 13.
Brian 20:23
Okay, I think a 13 is okay enough. But as you put your horn down and you start running, you're like, 'Oh, I think the beer's taken over and you sort of, waddle waddle waddle waddle waddle waddle and just run straight on, horns-first into that big wooden pillar support beam.
Ned 20:40
Sarah, I really hope this isn't foreshadowing.
Sarah 20:42
Oh no, no, we're done, we'll be fine.
Brian 20:44
You're like, 'I got him!'
Sarah 20:45
Right.
Brian 20:46
'He's made of wood.'
Sarah 20:47
'Hold on, what. When did that get there Dodgy?'
Brian 20:50
Hey Zenia. So you look up from your mutterings and realize that there's stuff going on. It's a little bit more exciting than it was 20 seconds ago.
Landree 20:59
Zenia sets down her glass of tepid water. She really does not want to get involved. And she looks around the tavern and spies the closest goon to her.
Brian 21:08
Oh, there's one like coming up to you at the table who says, 'Oh, look at this frail Vedalken. I'm going to wail on her.'
Landree 21:14
Cool.
Brian 21:15
Oh, I just got the worst side eye from her. You guys didn't see that.
Landree 21:21
Since you reflect Zenia's chilly mood, she's going to cast Chill Touch at this son of a bitch.
Brian 21:29
Oh.
Landree 21:31
For 11.
Brian 21:33
11 will not hit unfortunately.
Landree 21:35
Zenia sees, Zenia sees that this, this undead hand just kind of flops to the center of the table and she tries to cower behind one of her chairs.
Brian 21:47
She's like, 'Ooh.' Brevin.
Ned 21:52
Okay. So. All right. Question.
Brian 21:56
Okay.
Ned 21:56
It's when an object becomes a weapon that it flies to the wall, correct?
Brian 22:01
The minute that something not, that is not part of your person.
Ned 22:05
Okay.
Brian 22:06
That you make the conscious decision to use as a martial or an improvised weapon.
Ned 22:11
Yeah.
Brian 22:11
The magic barrier on Dodgy's tavern immediately sucks that up and sort of magnetizes it to the wall. So people can't stab and dome each other while they're drinking.
Ned 22:21
And as a first time attendee of the Leg End, would I know that?
Brian 22:25
Yes.
Ned 22:25
Would I know that?
Brian 22:25
Um, well
Ned 22:27
I know the weapons went, but would I know that like, that's, you know what I'm saying?
Brian 22:31
Uh, here's what I'm going to say. I'm going to make that a character choice as your first time here. I mean, it's pretty clear that if you pull out a dagger and try and use it that it's going to happen, but as far as like a loaf of bread, you might not know what's going to happen.
Ned 22:45
So here's what's going to happen. Brevin turns, looking at this room, having just seen someone die, having just seen like a hand come out, having seen a minotaur run into a pillar.
Sarah 22:54
Can we not talk about that?
Ned 22:57
Try and look straight at the nearest goon on the far side of that table and hurl his mug of beer as hard as he can at the, at the offender.
Brian 23:05
So as you like crank back to launch this tankard at this guy, you feel an incredible amount of resistance. And you realize, 'Oh, just the thought of me using this as a weapon to hurt somebody is enough to trigger the magic barrier,' and the mug just sort of flies out of your hand and zips up to the no-weapons-allowed wall and you realize, 'Oh, this is sort of a loose interpretation of what we're utilizing here.' But you haven't actually used your action yet. So you can still do stuff.
Ned 23:33
So then I say, 'no matter,' and I run right over, jumping off that bench and clearing the table to tackle the goon on the far side.
Brian 23:41
Oh, let's make an Acrobatics check here for that.
Ned 23:46
Great great great great great great great
Sarah 23:47
But that's the guy I was gonna attack.
Brian 23:49
Well, you're currently occupied by the pillar.
Ned 23:52
A 19.
Brian 23:53
A 19. Very good. Yeah, easily. It's a bench and a table. Step step. Let's make an attack roll.
Ned 23:59
Oh, I have to attack. That's. That's correct.
A three?
Brian 24:07
I was gonna assume by your pause that it did not end well.
Yeah, I'm gonna say you look a bit of a dick as you're like, you kind of lose this tankard and then you gear up for like a Randy Savage move off the table and he just stops and then just a swift kick that just doesn't go anywhere. So it is now the, the goon's move. We'll go in order. Well, Lorzatch, yours is currently on the ground I don't think you're
Andrew 24:38
Narrowly not deceased.
Brian 24:39
I think you're not getting attacked. I think the one that was sort of targeting Lennox Brightburne might have the compassion to at least say, 'Wow, you healed somebody. I'm not going to attack you.' But as for the undercity dweller, we're going to come in and and and throw some fists. Does an 18 hit?
Andrew 24:58
An 18 will hit.
Brian 25:00
It's unarmed, you will take two bludgeoning damage.
Andrew 25:04
Got it.
Brian 25:04
And you clearly get this these guys are not intending to kill you, they're just trying to beat you up to the point that you go, 'I don't know who you are. I didn't see you.' Fikarra, you're currently stabbing a pillar.
Sarah 25:19
I was looking at me funny.
Brian 25:20
As one, as one, as the one, there's sort of two by you and by Ned so one is going to swing at you. Does a 15 hit?
Sarah 25:31
It does not.
Brian 25:32
A 15 does not hit. And as for you, Ned, one's going to try and uppercut you in the split divide as you're standing above him on the table.
Sarah 25:41
In his bit of a dick area.
Brian 25:42
Does a 17 hit?
Ned 25:43
It doesn't.
Brian 25:44
A 17 does not hit you?
Ned 25:45
I have an 18 Armor Class.
Brian 25:49
Do you have a shield?
Ned 25:49
I do.
Brian 25:50
Oh, okay. Well, okay, thanks.
Thank you for, I was like, what, you're level two, what do you have? Oh, a shield. So he tries to throw a rather dirty uppercut and your shield just sort of points it down and he punches your shield instead.
Ned 26:06
Ow, that's pretty painful.
Brian 26:09
Zenia. A 7?
Landree 26:12
Nope.
Brian 26:14
So you're, she's sort of like dancing around the table like 'hee hee hee,' and this goon is trying to like get you, like 'get over here.'
Landree 26:22
Yeah, at this point, it has now become a kind of game for her.
Brian 26:27
Top of the order. Lorzatch. There are four remaining.
Andrew 26:31
Lorzatch will approach the nearest goon and will strike with his Primal Savagery. Those same gross crusty fungal growths coming out of his fingertips. And will a 15 hit?
Brian 26:47
Yeah.
Andrew 26:48
Okay.
Brian 26:48
Yeah, they're not wearing anything.
Andrew 26:51
For one point of acid damage.
Brian 26:53
Okay, so you, like
Andrew 26:56
Lightning does not strike twice.
Brian 27:00
You like melted this dude's face and I can see you just sort of turning to him with this devilish grin and just being like, 'yeah, it's the same thing.' And the guy's like, 'oh god oh god no.' And for whatever, you just reach out a single finger and just ssss on his nose.
Ned 27:17
Did you just nose boop him?
Brian 27:18
Yeah, just sort of boop him on the nose, little acid. Lennox. There are two in front of you. One is smoking a little bit off the nose.
Eddie 27:30
Lenox looks over and sees that the seemingly helpless sorceress is being attacked and decides to help her.
Brian 27:37
Yep.
Eddie 27:38
Summoning
Brian 27:39
Your Speed's 30?
Eddie 27:40
He doesn't need to.
Brian 27:42
Oh.
Eddie 27:42
He summons the sacred flame.
Brian 27:44
Oh. This got very real.
Ned 27:48
Didn't you, didn't you just say don't kill people?
Eddie 27:51
It's, it's, it's like not much more powerful than, it's not gonna kill him.
Ned 27:55
Oh, great. I just imagine, just like flame appearing in the midst
Brian 27:57
It's a cantrip.
Ned 27:57
Okay, great.
Eddie 27:57
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's gonna make him go, 'Oh.'
Sarah 27:57
Well gosh golly, maybe I shouldn't have done that.
Brian 27:57
What have I done with my life, why have you become?
Eddie 27:57
He has to make a saving throw.
Brian 28:15
Oh, what's the target number?
Eddie 28:16
14. It's a Dex 14.
Brian 28:18
So Dexterity?
Eddie 28:18
Yes.
Brian 28:19
Okay. That's a six. That's a seven. Like that matters. Like that difference matters. That's a six. No wait. It's a different number that also fails.
Sarah 28:30
You know, sometimes it matters.
Brian 28:32
It does. Well, sometimes.
Eddie 28:33
Three points of radiant damage.
Brian 28:36
So how does the sacred flame work? Is it just like a shining light? Or is it like, is it like a column of
Eddie 28:41
Flame-like radiance descends from the heavens enveloping my foe.
Brian 28:47
Oh.
Eddie 28:48
Causing radiant damage.
Brian 28:51
So just this arc of light just comes through wherever and just like strikes this dude in the face at the exact moment that he sort of arcs the edge of the table nearest to you. And it's just this pinpoint precision shot is he's just sort of like, 'Ugh!'
Eddie 29:05
And I say, 'Cease and desist!'
Brian 29:07
And he does. He just kind of like sits. He doesn't even make the chair. He just sits like right down on the ground. And you kind of catch a glimpse of Dodgy like, 'Where did that come from?' Just sort of like looking around. Did you put a hole in his tavern?
Landree 29:20
Zenia thanks Lennox and then takes her glass of tepid water and throws it on the goon.
Brian 29:30
Make an attack roll.
Landree 29:33
She was trying to be compassionate, but sure.
It would be a 10.
Brian 29:41
Yeah. So you just kind of miss with the water and it just sort of lands on his lap. Now he looks like he wet himself. As the cop was like, 'stop it.' And he's like, 'yeah,' and anyone else who doesn't really understand the exchange thinks he pissed him.
So we are going to, I guess shift the Initiative around a little bit in that particular. Fikarra, as you kind of pull yourself out from the pillar and just
Sarah 30:12
Alright, one more time. Not here. Let's go. And I'll ram.
Brian 30:19
Yes, so you're sort of doing a dance here with Ned's character Brevin over there.
Sarah 30:24
We're dancing. We're friends.
Ned 30:26
We're really cute.
Sarah 30:26
Yeah. We're adorable. That's a, that's a roll. It's an 11.
Brian 30:32
An 11 hits.
Sarah 30:33
Yeah! Hooray! I'm not gonna suck at rolling for this whole thing. That's going to be a seven.
Brian 30:42
Okay. So you just like pull your horns out and look at this dude and with a big old minotaur fist just be like 'boosh!' Right across the face. Brevin.
Ned 30:52
So this guy who I whiffed on earlier, feeling a little awkward about it now. For the flavor and the role play and the bar fight.
Brian 30:59
Yes.
Ned 30:59
I'm going to do jump off the table and attempt to grapple him by taking hold of the front of his cloak.
Brian 31:04
First, can I get an Acrobatics check?
Ned 31:05
Yeah, sure. 17.
Brian 31:09
Great. This is gonna be a long campaign. You successfully jump off the table. You're in midair. Please. And then you're going to try and grapple him?
Ned 31:18
And grab him by the front of the shirt.
Brian 31:21
Okay, it's going to be an opposing strength check.
Ned 31:23
Okay. 22.
Brian 31:26
14. Great. So, you have leapt off the table and you've grabbed him.
Ned 31:31
I am then going to Action Surge to headbutt him in the face. It's a 17.
Brian 31:36
Yeah.
Ned 31:37
So it just takes four points of damage.
Brian 31:38
Okay. So it is now their turn.
Ned 31:40
Okay.
Brian 31:41
They immediately realized that this was a stupid idea. And whoever told them to do this is not their friend anymore. And they begin to collect themselves and try and start making their way toward the door. At this point, as they kind of scurry their way out the tavern entrance you are left with one of them in the hands of Brevin.
Landree 32:02
'Dodgy, is all this about that, that weird guy with the cloak thing? What's going on?'
Brian 32:07
So Dodgy actually looks to you guys and is like, ""I don't want anything to do with this! I don't even know what this thing is."" And he pulls out the orb from behind the bar that had been shoved behind it when the fight started and he's holding it in his bare hand but he immediately drops it on the counter like in pain and is like, ""Bloody hell! That's cold!"" as if it's too cold to hold in someone's bare hand.
Landree 32:30
Ooh, shiny.
Brian 32:32
It is very shiny. It is perfect. In every application. It is a perfect metal orb.
Ned 32:41
Given the Sage background, is this something that I would know from, like, is this like an object of lore?
Brian 32:46
No.
Ned 32:46
Okay.
Brian 32:47
You have never seen anything like this before.
Ned 32:50
Copy.
Eddie 32:51
So...
Brian 32:52
It is so unsettlingly perfect, I would say.
Ned 32:55
Anyone
Eddie 32:55
I have restraints?
Brian 32:57
Do you have restraints?
Eddie 32:58
Yeah.
Brian 32:59
Yes. We have rope.
Eddie 33:00
So I restrain him.
Brian 33:01
Right. You would have a simple detainment spell.
Eddie 33:04
Yeah.
Brian 33:06
So you, you would conjure like a ribbon of runes that glows in blue and white.
Eddie 33:11
Uh huh.
Brian 33:12
And you, you are able to restrain him in whatever way you wish.
Eddie 33:15
And do I think that I need to use Spare the Dying on him, is he like bleeding out or anything?
Brian 33:19
No, it's non-lethal. He's just knocked out because he got a couple of fists and heads to the fists and head.
Eddie 33:27
So I try slapping him awake.
Brian 33:28
Okay. That's, give me a Medicine check.
Eddie 33:35
Wake up.
Ned 33:38
It's pretty good.
Eddie 33:39
Plus 5. 18.
Brian 33:41
Yeah, I would say that you managed to get him conscious. Did you want to do something?
Andrew 33:45
Just examine the orb with whatever skills
Brian 33:48
So the orb
Ned 33:49
Can you put the spores away, though?
Andrew 33:52
Oh they've, they've long since dispersed.
Brian 33:54
The orb is
Ned 33:57
For those at home Andrew just shook his head, horrifyingly.
Brian 34:01
The, the orb is currently sitting on the bar in front of Dodgy and he seems very unwilling to touch it again.
Landree 34:08
Zenia is entranced. She, she loves the shiny shiny, so she is just slowly walking towards it and I'd love to cast Detect Magic
Brian 34:16
Um, go ahead.
Sarah 34:19
Okay. Well, it's only 8.
Brian 34:21
The only magic that you know for certain is in this bar is the spell over the doorway that currently holds all of your martial weapons. Yes, sir.
Andrew 34:30
Lorzatch rolls an 18 for Arcana.
Brian 34:33
For Arcana. You have no knowledge of this. It is, it seems so strange to have been manufactured in the way that it is. Again, it is so unsettlingly perfect that the question first above everything is who would even have the capacity to make this. It does have mystical properties to it, but you're probably reading that towards its actual make.
Ned 35:03
So look, gang, I don't know about you all, but this is kind of exciting. And I don't have much else to do today. So I think we should see this through. Now, what the hell is that? What do we do?
Brian 35:14
Well, the one goon that has been subdued is now semi-conscious at least to talk.
Eddie 35:21
I pick him up.
Brian 35:22
Yes, he is very lucid.
Eddie 35:23
And I throw them on this table right here.
Ned 35:25
Sorry, Dodgy.
Eddie 35:26
Clunk! ""Why were you sent to acquire this item and what is it?""
Brian 35:32
So one of the immediate things you notice about this guy is there's ample opportunity for him to swear and cuss all the way up and down this wall. But he seems to be incredibly polite even during all this. ""Oh, geez. Oh man. This is really, oh sugar biscuits I'm really in it now.""
""Oh, that guy, I don't know. Like, look, man, we just do what Gato tells us man we're just the underlings oh geez please no not in the face not the, not the acid tell that acid freak to get away from me please.""
Ned 36:05
""I'm going to bring the acid freak even closer if you don't tell me who Gato is.""
Brian 36:09
""Look, man, we're just a security detail. We just work for some wealthy guy and Mr. Gato says we gotta go capture some dude who's a thief and that's it.""
Andrew 36:18
""Might that be one Mr. Alfonso?""
Brian 36:20
""Oh yeah, man. It's just Mr. Alfonso. It's just Mr. Alfonso, man, geez, aw criminies.""
Ned 36:26
""Who is Mr. Gato?""
Brian 36:28
""Mr. Gato is the boss man, man. He's the big man, man. The Man, man.""
Ned 36:34
""Like the guy with the mustache?""
Brian 36:34
""Yeah man! Open your eyes.""
Ned 36:36
I slap him across the face to calm him down.
Brian 36:38
""Aw gee willikers it hurts, mister!""
Landree 36:41
Zenia from the corner, she casts Minor Illusion on the guy. Ooh, it's a nat 20. And she takes on the voice of like, a more mature woman kinda kind of trying to sound like his mother.
Brian 36:57
Okay.
Landree 36:58
And is like, ""Look you just tell these people any information you know,"" and it's just whispering in his ears.
Brian 37:04
Okay, so let's pause and talk about Minor Illusion for a second. So you are creating an illusion to try and convince him.
Landree 37:12
Yeah, like I want it to be like the voice of his mother that's, like, you know what? Because he's close to death. He's had a hard day, she's
Brian 37:20
What is, what is your, what is your, what is your magic modifier to use, Wisdom?
Landree 37:24
No, Charisma.
Brian 37:26
Charisma. All right, let's see how he handles this. Oh, he starts weeping. He starts weeping like a baby. You have broken him. Like there is clearly some deep-seated fear. ""Oh I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I knew you wanted me to be better but I couldn't make it in the academy and I'm doing my best,"" and he's just, like, he's just like gone.
Ned 37:54
What is happening?
Brian 37:56
""I'm sorry."" So during, during these events, the Boros Legion shows up. So they, there is clearly a ruckus that has been happening, it took them a hot minute to come in. But several Boros legionnaires come into the door. And they immediately kind of look around and they immediately go over and one of them starts talking to Dodgy.
Sarah 38:17
""Sir!""
Brian 38:18
Yeah, Fikarra, they kind of look at you. And they're just like, 'oh no, what's happened?' So these are, these are probably not your superiors. They're probably just fellow people. You probably know them. They definitely know you.
Sarah 38:32
Okay.
Brian 38:32
Yeah.
Sarah 38:33
All right. So it's like Joe.
Brian 38:34
Yeah, Jeau.
Sarah 38:36
Joe.
Brian 38:37
J-E-A-U. Jeau.
Sarah 38:39
Jeau.
Ned 38:40
I hate Dungeons and Dragons.
Brian 38:44
So there's a couple of them and we'll say Jeau, Jeau comes over to you. Jeau is a, he's a tall human, probably sacrificed some brains for size at one point in his youth. Not quite as large as you, but
Sarah 38:57
Well, right. I mean.
Brian 38:57
A tough guy.
Sarah 38:58
""Hey, Jeau. How's it going?""
Brian 39:00
""You tell me.""
Sarah 39:00
""Oh, it's going really well.""
Brian 39:02
""Yeah?""
Sarah 39:02
""Just a...""
Brian 39:02
""It's a bar brawl?""
Sarah 39:02
""Little bit.""
Brian 39:02
""Yeah?""
Sarah 39:02
""No, I mean, not a lot, not a bad one. You know, no tables were broken.""
Brian 39:02
""Is this a civilian in custody?""
Sarah 39:02
""Of the justicars, yes.""
""Okay. What do I need to be worried about here, Fikarra?""
Brian 39:11
""Gato and Mr. Alfonso?""
""Oh boy."" Whatever is this presentation is in, the Boros have stepped in it and they're very clearly like, this has become a paperwork incident, like, they're like, 'oh, come on.'
Sarah 39:34
I will
Eddie 39:34
I walk up back to the bar.
Brian 39:36
Yes.
Eddie 39:37
And I pick up the orb.
Brian 39:39
You touch the orb.
You take eight points of chill damage.
Eddie 39:50
I say ""Agh, accursed item!""
Brian 39:53
Here is the very difficult thing to understand is, you saw the vagabond who had this produce it barehandedly.
Ned 40:01
Dodgy touched it, did he get hurt?
Brian 40:03
And now Dodgy and you touched it and it hurt to touch it. Just skin, skin contact it hurts to touch it.
Eddie 40:09
I take my cloak.
Brian 40:10
Yes.
Ned 40:11
Yeah.
Brian 40:12
Great.
Eddie 40:12
And I wrap it around it.
Brian 40:13
You now, in your inventory, possess a perfect steel orb. The one at the bar, who you do not know personally, but you do know is of a higher ranking officer, is a sergeant of some kind, but perhaps one that has kept his distance from you. And he kind of turns around and he goes, ""Jeau, wrap them all up. We're going."" ""If you would all please follow me.""
Sarah 40:39
""It's all right. You'll get your weapons back.""
Brian 40:41
Yeah, so your weapons and items have been collected off the magical wall. They will be redistributed to you so you have all your stuff back. But it comes with the understanding of like, look, we're not going to put you in manacles. We are willing to listen to your side of things. Don't give a reason to ignore that before you get a chance to state your case. So you are placed in the center of, you are surrounded by a squad of legionnaires, you will be escorted that way. Dodgy gives a wave on the way out to the remaining Boros legionnaires who are still cool with him. And you guys are exited out onto Theatre Row and as the day grows long and supper time sets in, you are marched down through the row. Amidst all the final preparations for tomorrow's festival of the Guildpact. The city is ready for excitement. Energy is primed into every decoration around you. Except you five are not destined for a party. You're destined for possible punishment as you make your way down toward the barracks of the 34th Boros precinct.
Sarah 41:45
This is gonna suck.
Brian 41:55
On the next Encounter Party! Our story has barely begun and our heroes already find themselves in hot water. A run-in with the law brings newfound debts and the festival turns from humor to horror. And just what is that mysterious orb? Find out on the next Encounter Party!
