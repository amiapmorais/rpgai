"Alba Salix 201: By The Book","INTRODUCTIO:
EL:
Welcome back to the land of Farloria! It’s time at last for Alba Salix, Volume Two. I’m Eli, co-writer and co-producer of this here show. This is the first of six episodes, coming at you weekly from now through the beginning of December.
This episode is sponsored by Join the Party, a Dungeons & Dragons real play podcast that’s exciting, inclusive, character-driven and completely hilarious.
Johnny’s a warlock on a mission to bring the Light to everyone in the land, and make sure they party responsibly. Inara is a super cool queer skater teen out to become an assassin and impress the ladies, not necessarily in that order. And Tracy—that’s Designation TR8C—is an adorable, excitable robot with a few rage issues. Together, they’re saving princes, running errands for gods, and surviving madcap reality show tournaments.
It’s the podcast that got me hooked on real play podcasts. And don’t worry: you don’t need to know the rules to enjoy it. It’s just good fun.
That is Join the Party. You can find out all about it at jointhepartypod.com.
And now, it’s time for Alba Salix, Volume Two, Episode One.
MUSIC STIN:
EXT. PALACE COURTYARD—DA:
Ominous music.
EMPEROR ROCKHAR:
People of Farloria! This day, your tiny kingdom joins the mighty Empire of Balgomar. Our Empire—your Empire—shall be immeasurably enriched by your people, your culture, and your precious, precious minerals. The magical energy that runs through your land shall fuel Balgomar for years to come!
A crowd cheers.
ROCKHART (CONT’D)
And to rule your small, quaint little province, I, Emperor Rockhart, give you your King and Queen-to-be: Prince Bulwark and Princess Minsey!
MINSE:
(giggles)
That’s us, darling!
BULWAR:
Yes! A kingdom of our very own!
MINSE:
You know, I’ve always liked this palace far more than that icky little pile of old rocks in Fair-Upon-Middling.
BULWAR:
Yes, truly this is a place fit for your beauteous self.
MINSE:
Oh, darling. My sweet little Bully Wully is going to be king!
BULWAR:
That’s me! Kingy Wingy!
They giggle.
MINSE:
You silly, silly boy.
ROCKHAR:
(clears his throat)
Your Majesties.
BULWAR:
Yes, Father? Oh, I suppose we should say something to our new subjects, shouldn’t we? Um, hello!
MINSE:
Hello!
The crowd gives a shout.
ROCKHAR:
A bright new future lies ahead for Farloria. But first, we must sweep aside the past. Bring forth the prisoners!
Heavy chains rattle. The dramatic music returns.
PARABEL
Let go of me! Murderers! Usurpers!
GUNTHE:
I say, there’s no need for all this unpleasantness.
PARABEL
You may take our lives, but the spirit of Farloria shall never be defeated.
MINSE:
Oh, be quiet, Auntie Parabel.
GUNTHE:
Minsey! How could you do this to us?
MINSE:
I’m so sorry, Uncle Gunther. But Daddy-in-law is right.
ROCKHAR:
Well said, my girl.
PARABEL
I knew it would come to this!
GUNTHE:
Minsey, please.
MINSE:
No! No, the line of succession is clear: so as long as you and your son are alive, our flimsy, foreign-sponsored claim to the throne is invalid, and therefore the only proper thing to do now is… off with their heads!
A roar from the crowd. Minsey and Bulwark’s giggling turns evil, then begins to echo unnaturally as the crowd chants, “Off with their heads!”
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. PALACE BEDCHAMBER—NIGH:
PARABEL
Nooo!
She sits up violently in bed, startling Gunther awake.
GUNTHE:
Darling! Parabel! What on earth is the matter?
PARABEL
Those little fiends! They won’t take my son!
GUNTHE:
Who won’t? What son?
PARABEL
Oh. Goodness, you’re right. I just dreamt I had a son…
GUNTHE:
Perhaps it’s a good omen, then.
PARABEL
No! No, Gunther, it was a nightmare!
GUNTHE:
Deep breaths, my treasure. Let’s get you some quell-flower tea.
He rings the servants’ bell.
PARABEL
(breathes deeply)
Yes. Yes, thank you, dear.
GUNTHE:
That’s the third night this week. Perhaps you ought to see your sister about this? She’s coming to the Palace in the morning.
PARABEL
Hmm. Perhaps I should.
GUNTHE:
She and that fairy of hers can probably come up with something stronger than tea.
PARABEL
Yes. We’ll need something much, much stronger.
OPENING THEM:
HERAL:
By Appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician—Volume Two! Episode the First: By The Book.
INT. EXAM ROOM—MORNIN:
ALB:
So what seems to be the problem, Mister, uh…?
Sir Galitus’s voice is slightly muffled. He still has his helmet on, and his armour jingles as he speaks.
GALITU:
Galitus. Sir Galitus Lightwind the Pure, slayer of foul monsters, bringer of peace and justice.
ALB:
And have you had any—
GALITU:
’Twas I who forded the Great Raging River and pulled the Mighty Mace of Maxilarth from the Heaving Swamp.
ALB:
Congratulations. What brings you to the House of Healing?
GALITU:
Madam Salix, the matter is slightly embarrassing.
ALB:
Believe me, we’ve seen everything here.
GALITU:
Um… I appear to have a rash upon my face.
ALB:
That’s all?
GALITU:
To be the noblest of knights, one needs the noblest face, to stir the hearts of the good folk of the kingdom. But now I must keep my helmet on so that none will see my great disfigurement.
ALB:
I’m sure it’s fine. Come on, helmet off.
GALITU:
Do I have to?
ALB:
I pulled a spoon out of a toddler’s nose this morning. I’m not worried about your little rash.
GALITU:
Yes. Very well.
Galitus takes off his helmet with a clank.
ALB:
Oh dear, this is a bad one.
GALITU:
Indeed. Methinks it came about when I slew the fearsome Manticore of the Northern Wastes.
ALB:
How do you figure?
GALITU:
It didst smite me with its venom, such that my legs grew weak. But I held my ground and laid low the beast that had terrorized—
ALB:
Did it smite you in the face?
GALITU:
No, no, it was my shin.
ALB:
I don’t think the manticore caused your rash.
GALITU:
I think you’ll find it did.
ALB:
Let me see that helmet. You’ve been wearing this a lot, haven’t you?
GALITU:
Well, yes. This helm was crafted by the dwarven smiths of Logath-Blaggit.
ALB:
I think your skin is having a reaction to the metal.
GALITU:
’Twas forged and shaped precisely to fit me! Surely it is hypoallergenic.
ALB:
We’re going to have to run some tests.
(calls)
Magnus!
Magnus enters. Galitus hurriedly puts the helmet back on.
MAGNU:
Yo, what’s up, boss?
GALITU:
Don’t bring in more people!
ALB:
This is my apprentice, Magnus. Magnus, I think Sir Galitus here is having an issue with his helmet. Sir Galitus, if you would?
GALITU:
Well… fine.
He takes the helmet off.
MAGNU:
Oh, that’s brutal. Sweet helmet, though. Dwarves make this?
GALITU:
Aye.
MAGNU:
Badass. What’s this writing around the inside?
GALITU:
Those be the magic runes of the dwarves of the East-Northeast. I bested their champion in a duel for their vast mountain kingdom, but great-hearted as I am, I asked only for a fine helm from their legendary forge.
MAGNU:
So what does it say?
GALITU:
It reads, “To he who cheats death.”
ALB:
Of course! That’s what it is.
GALITU:
What what is?
ALB:
The mark on your forehead. Three crossed lines. It’s a rune too. In olden days, the dwarves used to brand their criminals with that very symbol.
GALITU:
Criminals?!
ALB:
And this doesn’t say “To he who cheats death.”
GALITU:
It does so!
Alba taps the inside of the helmet.
ALB:
It starts here. “Death to he who cheats.”
GALITU:
I would never cheat!
ALB:
Tell me, this duel that you won…
GALITU:
I did not switch our swords! It’s a filthy lie!
ALB:
Uh huh.
MAGNU:
What do you think, Alba? Orb of Hydrogenes?
ALB:
If you would.
Magnus fetches the Orb and waves it. It makes a magical shimmer which suddenly perks up as he gets close to the helmet.
MAGNU:
Oh yeah. This is one cursed-ass helmet.
ALB:
And you see, right across the forehead, there’s where they inscribed your magic rune. Precisely the same shape and location as your rash.
GALITU:
They marked me! Those little mongrels! With their filthy magic and their… their wordplay.
ALB:
Well, not to worry. We can fix this. Holly!
Holly enters. Galitus puts his helmet back on.
GALITU:
What…? No, not more people!
HOLL:
Hi Alba! Hi Mister Knight!
GALITU:
(petulant)
I’m not a “mister”.
ALB:
Sir Galitus, this is our resident herbalist, Holly. And the sooner you take the helmet back off, the sooner we can fix your rash.
Galitus sighs and complies.
HOLL:
Oh gosh. Mister… Sir, your forehead!
GALITU:
This is humiliating.
HOLL:
Did you cheat a clan of dwarves?
MAGNU:
He so did.
GALITU:
I resent these accusations.
ALB:
It looks like a simple spectral concentrator. Holly, do you have anything that will reverse it?
HOLL:
A solution of Penroth’s Blue Chickweed and some Revolting Violet should clear it up in a day or two.
ALB:
See to it, please.
HOLL:
You got it.
She heads for the pantry.
GALITU:
(quietly)
Will this prevent the… death part?
ALB:
Death part?
GALITU:
If the runes say “death to he who cheats…” does that mean I am to die?
ALB:
I don’t think so. But you might want to go back and ask them. Very nicely.
GALITU:
Yes, Madam Salix.
ALB:
Now, if you’d like to have a seat outside, Holly will be right out to bring you your prescription.
Galitus dons his helmet once again.
GALITU:
Yes, Madam Salix.
He leaves the room.
ALB:
Good work.
MAGNU:
You know it. So? What do you say to teaching me some more magic?
ALB:
Have all those bile samples been tested?
MAGNU:
Oh. Yeah. I’m almost done. Partly done. Somewhat.
I’ll start on it today.
ALB:
Yes, please. I’m off to the Palace in a minute. We’ll talk when I get back.
MAGNU:
Yeah we will!
Alba shuts the door.
MUSIC STIN:
INT. THRONE ROOM—LATER THAT MORNIN:
Alba rummages in her bag.
ALB:
Here. A tonic of reverium sap and truncheon berry. One mouthful just before bedtime should bring on a good night’s sleep, and pleasant dreams.
Parabel uncorks the small bottle and sniffs it.
PARABEL
Ugh! It’s revolting.
ALB:
Well, it’s tonic or nightmares. Take your pick.
PARABEL
I can’t drink this.
GUNTHE:
Really? It smells delightful to me.
PARABEL
Some of us have more delicate senses.
ALB:
Well, I’ll leave it here, in case you change your mind.
GUNTHE:
If that’s all settled, Alba, we’d like you to join us for lunch.
ALB:
Oh. Yes. Lovely. Hopefully not a long lunch.
GUNTHE:
Come along. It should be waiting for us.
They walk out together into the corridor.
ALB:
What’s the occasion?
GUNTHE:
I’m sure you’ve been wondering what’s going to become of the Office of the Sorceror General, now that our Sorceror General has, um…
ALB:
Been arrested for plotting to murder your niece, and fled the kingdom?
PARABEL
He acted alone, I understand!
GUNTHE:
Yes. Rather. Well, considering that little incident, we’ve consulted with the Mages’ Guild and decided to reorganize the OSG under non-wizardly oversight.
ALB:
Oh? It’s about time. Who’s leading it?
Gunther opens a door and ushers Alba and Parabel into a reception room. As they enter, a calm, measured woman in her 30s stands up from the table: Antalia Pearcey.
GUNTHE:
I’m glad you asked. Here she is. Good morning!
PEARCE:
Your Majesties.
PARABEL
Hello, Minister.
GUNTHE:
Alba, may I present Antalia Pearcey, late of the Ministry of Transportation. Ms. Pearcey, this is Alba Salix, our Royal Physician.
ALB:
Nice to meet you.
PEARCE:
And you. I’ve heard so many good things.
GUNTHE:
Ms. Pearcey will bring her administrative talents to bear, overseeing an all-new department known as the Ministry of Magical Affairs and Health.
ALB:
Well, I think that will be a great step—wait, health?
GUNTHE:
Yes! Since so much of your practice is mucking about with magical… things, we thought it would fit like a proverbial glove.
ALB:
Well sure, I use magic, but… Ms. Pearcey, I thought you were going to be taking over the Office of Planning?
PEARCE:
That was the original idea. But His Majesty has taken such a keen interest in the kingdom’s architecture…
ALB:
Gunther? You’re going to head the Planning Office?
GUNTHE:
Yes, it turns out I have a talent for it! It came as quite a surprise.
PEARCE:
Yes, quite a surprise.
GUNTHE:
I’ve been overseeing a new project there this week. They’re designing a public square in front of the new Mysticorp headquarters. Look at this!
He pulls out a sheet of paper.
ALB:
Is that supposed to be a pair of dragons?
GUNTHE:
Yes, that was my idea. It’s a fountain!
ALB:
Oh, I see. So that’s water that they’re… vomiting.
GUNTHE:
Spouting.
ALB:
Spouting. Sorry.
GUNTHE:
There’ll be lights too. All magically powered. It’s most exciting.
ALB:
As long as His Majesty refrains from having my garden torn out.
PARABEL
Oh, your garden again. One little decree and I never hear the end of it.
A servant enters with a tray.
GUNTHE:
Oh look. Here comes our lunch!
PARABEL
What is this? I specifically said, no cucumber!
SERVAN:
But Your Majesty—
PARABEL
Loathsome. Take it away!
GUNTHE:
I’ll gladly have yours. What would you rather, my dear?
PARABEL
(fumes, then:)
Are there any anchovies in the kitchen? And pickled plums?
SERVAN:
I will fetch some right away, Majesty.
The servant hurries off.
GUNTHE:
Good heavens.
PARABEL
I just felt like having something salty.
ALB:
Curse those delicate senses of yours.
PARABEL
(huffs)
I’ll be in the kitchen.
She exits as well.
GUNTHE:
Parabel!
(back to Alba and Pearcey)
Ah, well. Where was I?
ALB:
So Your Majesty will be in charge of planning.
Uh, Ms. Pearcey…
PEARCE:
Yes?
ALB:
Do you have any experience overseeing magic? Or health?
PEARCE:
Our roads and ports are used by many magical vehicles.
ALB:
So… no.
GUNTHE:
But Farlorian roads and ports are now among the finest on the continent!
ALB:
Aside from that little incident where we tried to run dragon boats and swan boats along the same stretch of canal.
PEARCE:
(haunted)
That was not my idea.
ALB:
So what is your plan for this new Ministry?
PEARCE:
In a word: standardization.
ALB:
And in more words?
PEARCE:
We want to replicate your success with the House of Healing. Expand it.
GUNTHE:
Alba, you’ve been arguing for months that we should better serve our more remote regions.
ALB:
Well, yes. Think of the Pointy Lands. We’ve got a whole province going to see one overworked witch in a candy cottage that’s been chewed to pieces by the local kids.
PEARCE:
Exactly. So we need to develop a blueprint for service delivery.
GUNTHE:
(eager)
A blueprint. Yes, yes.
PEARCE:
We are going to systematize the way you run the House of Healing. Examine what you do to create a manual of best practices. Everything down to the last pill, potion and procedure.
ALB:
(scoffs)
Everything? In one manual?
PEARCE:
I believe that’s what I said.
ALB:
I mean, we’re good at what we do, but every case is different. Every patient, every complaint…
PEARCE:
But it’s the delivery that stays the same.
(heading off Alba)
Which is why we’re going to proceed with implementing the EIIRP‑9 standard across all our facilities.
ALB:
Are you.
PEARCE:
Yes. We are. And that “we” includes you. And everyone at the House of Healing.
ALB:
Lucky “us”.
GUNTHE:
Very sensible indeed. Er… what is an E double‑I…?
PEARCE:
…RP. Everything In Its Right Place, Level 9. The same standard I implemented at the Ministry of Transportation. Outlining our desired outcomes, processes and decision-making approach.
GUNTHE:
Well, that sounds terribly worthwhile. I should be getting along now—got to be at the mint to approve my portrait for next year’s coins.
PEARCE:
Ms. Salix, I’d love to dive right in and pay a visit to your clinic. How does this afternoon sound?
ALB:
Why, that should be no problem at all.
GUNTHE:
I do love it when my staff gets along.
MUSIC STIN:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING—RECEPTIO:
Alba has just arrived back at the HH in a flurry.
HOLL:
What are you worried about, Alba? I love organizing!
ALB:
The new Minister is revamping everything. New procedures, new rules…
MAGNU:
I always said what we need here is more rules.
ALB:
Well, you’ve got ’em.
She dumps an armload of books on the counter.
MAGNU:
Whoa. That’s… some books.
HOLL:
Yay for books!
ALB:
Those are just the index. The Minister’s on her way here now, and I saw one of her assistants loading a wheelbarrow.
HOLL:
Gosh. These are all books on how to do our jobs?
ALB:
Nope. They’re books on how to decide how to do our jobs.
MAGNU:
We get to decide?
ALB:
Minister Pearcey gets to decide.
(sighs)
We’re probably going to have to change everything. Just when we were starting to find our rhythm.
MAGNU:
So pull rank, then! You could be all like, “My sister is the Queen, so there! Off with your head, sucker!”
ALB:
I would appreciate it if you didn’t say things like that in front of the Minister. And can we please clean up here? What are these vials doing all over the reception desk?
MAGNU:
They’re the bile samples you asked me to analyze. Look. Results right here.
He waves a thick folder.
HOLL:
Wow, that’s a whole pile of bile vial trial files!
MAGNU:
Right?
HOLL:
See, that rhymed!
ALB:
Yes, thank you. Magnus, if you have laboratory work to do, you do it in the laboratory.
MAGNU:
Well, today the lab smells like dead, burnt fish.
HOLL:
It’s not fish, it’s seaweed.
MAGNU:
Oh sure, sorry, that’s perfectly fine, then.
HOLL:
It’s a remedy for milkmaid’s knee. Or it will be. I’m this close to nailing the formula. This close!
MAGNU:
Have you tried not setting fire to it?
ALB:
Both of you, get all these vials put away in the lab.
MAGNU:
Boy, somebody’s stressed out.
ALB:
Now.
HOLL:
Okay!
Magnus and Holly gather up the vials and open the door to the lab. Alba gasps at the smell.
ALB:
Holly, I think we should discuss letting you work from home.
HOLL:
But I like it here! Isn’t it nice to have company while you work?
ALB:
Company, yes. Toxic fumes, no.
MAGNU:
See? Could you work under these conditions?
ALB:
That’s enough, Magnus.
The door opens and Pearcey enters.
PEARCE:
Good afternoon—
(suddenly gagging)
What is that smell?
Magnus returns and shuts the door.
MAGNU:
Oh, nothing, just violating our own health and safety rules.
ALB:
Holly, Magnus, this is Antalia Pearcey, the new Minister of Magical Affairs… and Health.
PEARCE:
Hello, team.
ALB:
Ms. Pearcey, this is Holly, our herbalist and potions specialist.
HOLL:
Hi there!
ALB:
And my apprentice Magnus.
MAGNU:
Apprentice surgeon.
HOLL:
Would you like a cup of tea?
MAGNU:
(whispers)
Say no.
PEARCE:
(stiffly)
It’s good to meet you all. You might be wondering why I’m here today.
MAGNU:
Are you taking over the kingdom?
ALB:
Magnus.
PEARCE:
Am I what?
MAGNU:
I mean, you’re the new Sorceror General, right?
PEARCE:
In a sense. But there is no longer a Sorceror General.
MAGNU:
The old guy was all bent on taking over. I thought it was like a wizard thing.
PEARCE:
I’m not a wizard. That’s the whole point. We’re getting off topic here.
(clears her throat)
As Farloria grows, the demands on the House of Healing will become greater. There’ll be more patients to treat. You’ll need to expand. Bring on more staff. And I know that you can all rise to meet these new challenges with talent and enthusiasm.
HOLL:
Yay!
MAGNU:
Yay.
HOLL:
I don’t know what you were complaining about, Alba. This is going to be great!
PEARCE:
Is there an issue, Ms. Salix?
ALB:
I thought my staff might have some concerns.
HOLL:
Nope!
PEARCE:
Change is always hard. And there are definitely changes ahead. Normalizing procedures. Staff training. Labour standards.
MAGNU:
(mock incredulity)
Standards? For labour?
PEARCE:
That’s right.
MAGNU:
Would that mean, for instance, that I’d get to sleep indoors?
ALB:
The toolshed is indoors.
MAGNU:
Well, maybe according to the letter of the law…
PEARCE:
That’s definitely something we’d address when we do our assessment of working conditions in Stage Two.
MAGNU:
I got an assessment for you.
ALB:
Stage Two, Magnus. We have to do these things in the proper order.
HOLL:
What’s Stage One?
PEARCE:
Stage One is what we call a “user needs assessment”. We discover who is visiting the House of Healing…
ALB:
That would be “everyone in the city”.
PEARCE:
…what services they require, and what you require to deliver those services. Stage Two is about your experience here to date. The working conditions, but also your opinions. Your feelings.
HOLL:
Our feelings? Aww! You’re the best, Ms. Pearcey.
PEARCE:
That’s… uh, thank you?
HOLL:
The way Alba was talking, I thought this was going to be nothing but paperwork.
PEARCE:
No, no. Most of it is about listening. Just as an example… I’d like to get from each of you a couple of words that you think describe the House of Healing.
HOLL:
Ooh! Ooh! Today I’m feeling pride. Because we helped eight patients today, including a knight with a really rare curse, and a sweet old couple with toad pox! That’s such a tricky one to diagnose, but we did it! Because we’re the team that heals! Together!
PEARCE:
So. Pride—that’s a good one. Any others? Magnus?
MAGNU:
Let’s see…
HOLL:
Satisfaction! Last week, I just finished relabeling every last bottle, box, pouch and canister in the pantry. See? They all have their name and catalogue number here. I love decorating the labels.
She picks up a bottle.
PEARCE:
Yes, very thorough. Er, does this say “Sockweed”? No… “Storkwort”?
ALB:
It’s “Goblin grass”.
PEARCE:
That’s a “G”?
ALB:
You get the hang of Holly’s handwriting after a few months.
MAGNU:
Speak for yourself.
HOLL:
Organized!
PEARCE:
I beg your pardon?
HOLL:
When I first started here, I owed Alba many, many good deeds, and it always felt like I could never catch up. Now I finally feel like I’m on top of everything and I know where everything is!
PEARCE:
Well. That will certainly come in very useful soon as we implement the new cataloguing system.
HOLL:
New… cataloguing system?
PEARCE:
Oh yes. When we’re finished, we’ll have a searchable inventory of all the assets at the House of Healing. Have a look through the manual if you want to read ahead.
Pearcey sets another heavy tome on the counter.
HOLL:
“Everything In Its Right Place.” That sounds… sensible.
MAGNU:
Ha ha! Now you’re going to have to redo everything.
ALB:
Magnus.
HOLL:
It’s okay. If it’s that important to you, Ms. Pearcey, we can do it!
PEARCE:
I appreciate it. So. Magnus? What words would you use to describe your workplace experience?
MAGNU:
Gruelling. Boring. Uh… endless.
PEARCE:
Really! Perhaps you could expand on those.
MAGNU:
Intensely gruelling. Mind-numbingly boring. Endlessly… bad.
ALB:
Ms. Pearcey, I should apologize for my apprentice.
PEARCE:
No, it’s quite all right. I want our employees to feel free to speak their minds.
MAGNU:
Alba’s just mad because she won’t be able to hit me any more.
PEARCE:
She hits you?
ALB:
I…! I’ve never hit him that hard. And never when he didn’t deserve it.
PEARCE:
Physical correction is explicitly forbidden under the Ministry Code of Conduct.
MAGNU:
This one time, I broke a jar, and she hauled me out to the garden and made me eat brimstone peppers!
ALB:
No one made you eat them.
MAGNU:
She totally tricked me into it! She’s like, “Here, you have to learn to identify plants by taste. Eat this.”
ALB:
Well, can you pick out a brimstone pepper by taste now?
PEARCE:
Clearly, we also need to establish a standard course of study for House of Healing employees.
ALB:
Well. Strictly speaking, Magnus isn’t an employee.
PEARCE:
Oh? Are you a volunteer?
ALB:
Magnus is doing community service here on the orders of His Majesty. Serving three consecutive sentences for various crimes.
MAGNU:
“Crimes”. I knocked over a tent.
ALB:
Very nearly killing dozens.
PEARCE:
This is clearly a big topic! Let’s talk about this when we get to the Stage Two evaluation.
MAGNU:
Bring it on.
Holly is still reading the index. She turns a page.
HOLL:
Wait. There’s a filing system for baked goods?
PEARCE:
And Ms. Salix? How would you describe the House of Healing?
ALB:
It’s a house where we heal people.
PEARCE:
I like that. Straight to the point. It’s a good reminder to stick to our core mission.
ALB:
Yes. So what’s your mission here today?
PEARCE:
This is just a get-to-know-you session. Tomorrow’s when we really start in earnest. I’d like to shadow you throughout a regular day to see how things work around here.
ALB:
Great.
HOLL:
(weakly)
Yay!
INT. EXAM ROOM—NEXT MORNIN:
Alba is seeing T’Horxa, a weedy would-be adventurer wearing a helmet. In the background, a pen can be heard scratching away at high speed.
ALB:
And what seems to be the problem, Mister… T’Horxa?
T’HORX:
T’Horxa the Invincible! Defeater of evil, bringer of harmony and niceness.
ALB:
Yes. I’m sure your exploits are many and legendary.
T’HORX:
So legendary. Just, um… quick question. Who’s this?
ALB:
This is Ms. Pearcey—
The writing stops. It’s Pearcey.
PEARCE:
Please, just pretend I’m not here. I’m monitoring the treatment to help the House of Healing team improve the patient experience.
T’HORX:
So… you’re not a doctor?
PEARCE:
Don’t worry. All of this is completely confidential. Nothing in these notes will personally identify you.
ALB:
As I was saying, what can we help you with today?
T’HORX:
I’m… uh… T’Horxa is embarrassed to say.
ALB:
Something to do with your helmet, perhaps?
T’HORX:
My helmet? No. I mean… nay. I am here because of a blight upon my face.
ALB:
Caused by your helmet.
PEARCE:
That seems like a rather hasty conclusion at this stage, don’t you think?
ALB:
I thought you weren’t here.
T’HORX:
What’s wrong with my helmet?
ALB:
Let’s see. Did you happen to buy it for an unbelievable price some time yesterday?
T’HORX:
(he so did)
Uh… this helm was forged by the dwarves of… Laggity-Blaggity.
ALB:
And you acquired it from a bold knight with a name like… Galitus?
T’HORX:
Nay…
PEARCE:
Ms. Salix, we’re really diverging from our client intake protocol.
ALB:
Yes we are, because I’ve seen this exact helmet before. Mister T’Horxa, can you take it off, please?
T’HORX:
Does she really have to be here? Writing down everything?
ALB:
Apparently.
PEARCE:
These are simply notes on how our staff perform.
T’HORX:
(reluctant)
T’Horxa consents.
He takes off the helmet.
ALB:
As I thought. You’ve been cursed, I’m afraid.
PEARCE:
Cursed?
T’HORX:
Cursed?
ALB:
A spectral concentrator, to be precise.
PEARCE:
You’re not going to run any tests?
ALB:
We saw a patient yesterday who got himself into trouble with a clan of dwarves, and they gave him this very helmet. It seems to have made its way to Mister T’Horxa here, and affected him in exactly the same way.
PEARCE:
I would have thought you’d test for sensitivity to metal, for changes in diet…
ALB:
Look, I’ll show you. Magnus!
(to T’Horxa)
No, leave the bloody helmet off.
Magnus enters.
MAGNU:
Sup, witches? Oh, look, it’s a knight with a helmet. And a rash.
ALB:
Orb of Hydrogenes?
MAGNU:
Why, I just so happen to have it right here.
PEARCE:
That’s convenient.
MAGNU:
You don’t forget a helmet like that.
T’HORX:
Uh… thanks?
Magnus waves the Orb. It shimmers in much the same way as before.
MAGNU:
Yup, still cursed.
ALB:
Who’d have thunk. Holly!
PEARCE:
Ms. Salix, I don’t believe Magnus is certified to operate magical equipment.
MAGNU:
What? I do it all the time.
T’HORX:
Not certified?
PEARCE:
All Ministry personnel who use magical items or spells must undergo a one-day safety training, unless they’ve graduated from an approved school of magic.
MAGNU:
Really? If I take the training, does that mean I can use any magical equipment here?
ALB:
No.
PEARCE:
No. Basic gear only.
MAGNU:
Dangit.
ALB:
Would you go and find Holly, please?
MAGNU:
Fine.
He leaves.
T’HORX:
So… he’s not supposed to use that glowy thing?
ALB:
The Orb is just a diagnostic tool. Hell, it’s safer than most of the surgical gear we use.
PEARCE:
Yes. Thank you for reminding me—that will be a separate training course.
She makes a note. Holly bustles in.
HOLL:
Hi everybody! What’s up, Alba?
ALB:
The cursed helmet has struck again.
HOLL:
I heard! Lucky I made too much of that salve yesterday.
PEARCE:
What salve would this be?
HOLL:
Penroth’s Chickweed and Revolting Violet. I came up with it myself!
PEARCE:
So this wasn’t a previously documented remedy.
HOLL:
Nope. The violet cancels out residual energy from the curse, see, and—
PEARCE:
Has it been through clinical trials?
HOLL:
Of course! I always taste as I go. Plus we gave it to Sir Galitus yesterday.
PEARCE:
And you’ve booked a follow-up appointment with him to evaluate the results?
ALB:
I don’t expect he’ll be back this way any time soon.
PEARCE:
(sighs)
So you have an effective sample size of one. Ms. Salix, this isn’t good.
HOLL:
I’m telling you, it’s perfectly safe.
T’HORX:
Uh, perhaps T’Horxa should go.
ALB:
Sit. Down.
T’HORX:
Okay.
PEARCE:
How was this solution stored?
HOLL:
In a bowl. Don’t worry! It’s still good! Here, do you want me to test it now? Let’s test it!
She dabs some salve on herself.
ALBA AND PEARCE:
Holly!
HOLL:
It’s all good. See? Ooh, tingly. That’s how you know it’s working. Now, Mister T’Horxa, just hold still and close your eyes.
T’HORX:
T’Horxa is not on board with this!
All hell breaks loose. Everyone is speaking at once:
HOLL:
No, no, it’s safe! Watch, Ms. Pearcey! You’ll see! Stop moving, I don’t want to get it in your eyes!
ALB:
Holly, stop it. Put the salve down! I’m sorry about this, Mister T’Horxa. Holly!
PEARCE:
Holly, that solution is not approved. Everyone, calm down. Ms. Salix, get her to stop.
T’HORX:
No! No! I don’t want tingly stuff on my face! Help! Aaa! It burns! Aaaa!
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING OFFIC:
Tense silence.
PEARCE:
(sighs)
Well. I must say—
HOLL:
I’m so sorry, Ms. Pearcey. It’s all my fault.
ALB:
It’s fine, Holly.
PEARCE:
No, it is not. It is not “fine”. Ms. Salix, in the space of a single morning, you and your team have operated magical items without proper training; leapt to fanciful conclusions without any sort of standard diagnostic questionnaire; used an untested, improperly stored remedy against the stated wishes of the patient which caused a significant skin reaction…
MAGNU:
(snickers)
PEARCE:
…due to a hazardous ingredient mixed in by a staff member as a prank.
MAGNU:
Hey, I didn’t think Holly was going to use that stuff on any more patients. But sometimes she drinks the leftovers—see?
HOLL:
Magnus!
MAGNU:
I was trying to teach her a lesson about safe disposal of medicines. I am helping to improve our team’s compliance. Boom.
PEARCE:
Stop digging, young man. You’re already in over your head.
ALB:
All right. Thank you, Minister. Are we done here?
PEARCE:
I am recommending to His Majesty that you, Ms. Salix, attend a six-week course in standard Ministry protocol and procedure…
ALB:
For heaven’s sake.
PEARCE:
…and that your two assistants be let go, effective immediately.
HOLL:
What?!
MAGNU:
Ohhh, you’re kidding. Sweet freedom!
ALB:
You’ll be going back to jail.
MAGNU:
After working here I should get off with time served.
ALB:
Take it up with the King.
HOLL:
We can do better, Ms. Pearcey! I promise we can! Upon my honour—
PEARCE:
Enough! All of you.
ALB:
No.
PEARCE:
Excuse me?
ALB:
No. This is my team. They may not live up to your vision of a perfect, efficient department—
PEARCE:
They don’t live up to my vision of a stampede in a barnyard.
ALB:
Too bad. When they don’t have a… well-meaning bureaucrat second-guessing their every move, they do just fine.
I will take full responsibility for what happened to Mister T’Horxa. You’re right—we rushed the diagnosis because I wanted to get this exercise over with. And maybe look a little bit impressive.
Yes. We’re here to heal people, not because we want to show off or look good.
MAGNU:
Well—
ALB:
Shut it, Magnus. We will begin implementing the new Ministry guidelines. But let’s get one thing straight. This is still my House of Healing. Barnyard or not, I will run it as I see fit.
PEARCE:
Very well. Let me be clear. You’re part of my ministry now. And I expect your House of Healing and all your staff to meet or exceed our standard. You have a week to produce an action plan. We’ll reassess then.
ALB:
Yes. Thank you, Minister.
PEARCE:
(under her breath)
The wizards were bad enough.
Pearcey strides out. The door slams behind her.
HOLL:
Wow, Alba!
MAGNU:
That was so good. You totally should have said “Off with her head!”
HOLL:
You did it! We’re still a team!
ALB:
A team with twenty-one volumes of guidelines to read.
HOLL:
We can do this. Let’s show Ms. Pearcey how good we really are!
ALB:
Please don’t say that.

Hey, hallo, bonjour! It’s Eli, your co-writer and co-producer. We wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who’s been sharing the show out there on social media, playing it for a friend, all that stuff. We’re so glad to know you’re enjoying the show. It really does make our day.
This episode is brought to you by The Amelia Project. It is a witty and delightful audio drama podcast about an exclusive agency whose job it is to help their clients fake their deaths and start a new life somewhere else. Cult leaders, criminals, TV stars—every episode, there’s a new client planning their escape, and every client is weirder and funnier than the last.
And if that’s not enough for you, they just released a special episode that crosses over with four other shows, and one of those shows might just be Alba Salix, Royal Physician, just saying. As for the other three shows, I’m not going to spoil anything, except to say that we love them all very much and that the crossovers are hilarious and so, so perfect.

MUSIC STIN:
INT. MINISTRY OFFIC:
A clock ticks steadily in the background. A big wooden door opens, and Loria Berenice enters the room.
LORI:
(warmly)
Good morning, Madam Minister.
PEARCE:
(stern)
Good morning, Ms Berenice.
Do you have our presentation to the Chancellor ready for this afternoon?
LORI:
Good to go. No preamble, like you said—we’ll just bury him in numbers until he begs for mercy.
PEARCE:
And gives us our budget, I hope.
And remind me, what’s this morning?
Loria searches through a messy pile of papers and books.
LORI:
Uh… This morning… is… inspection at the House of Healing.
PEARCE:
Ah yes. The jewel in the crown of this department.
LORI:
And they should be getting their new secure storage unit installed today too.
PEARCE:
What time?
LORI:
The best I could get out of Magic Support was “some time between ten A.M. and six P.M.”
PEARCE:
(sighs)
As always. All right. I’m off to the House of Healing.
She rises and begins putting on her coat.
LORI:
Shall I bring you the whip, Minister?
PEARCE:
Hmm. No, make it a cudgel. Something that lands on a skull with a nice solid thunk.
LORI:
Of course. Who knows? Maybe they’ll actually be ready for you this time.
PEARCE:
They’d better be.
OPENING THEM:
HERAL:
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician, Volume Two! Episode the Second: Tried and Tested.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING RECEPTIO:
HOLL:
(singing)
The laundry’s done and the beds are made!
ALB:
Thank you, Holly.
(calls)
Magnus? How’s the lab coming?
MAGNU:
(from the back hallway)
Just putting away the glassware now. Whoops!
He drops a beaker, which smashes.
ALBA AND HOLL:
Magnus!
Magnus starts sweeping up.
MAGNU:
It’s okay, it’s okay—that was a bad beaker. Very unfit for inspection. It had like, stains… and totally would not pass muster with Minister Fearsome.
ALB:
If you call her that to her face I will hit you—
MAGNU:
Uh-uh! No physical assault on colleagues, remember?
ALB:
Damn these new rules.
Magnus enters the reception area, dusting off his hands.
MAGNU:
All right. Lab’s all done.
ALB:
And the back hallway?
MAGNU:
And the back hallway. Oh. Also, nobody open the right-hand supply cupboard.
HOLL:
My right or your right?
MAGNU:
Holly, don’t open any of the supply cupboards.
HOLL:
Check.
The front door opens.
PEARCE:
Good morning, everyone.
ALBA MAGNUS AND HOLL:
Good morning, Ms Pearcey.
MAGNU:
So, are we all fired yet?
PEARCE:
No. No one’s being fired, oddly enough. Thank you for your efforts in adhering to the new Ministry guidelines. I know this can’t be easy.
ALB:
And the action plan?
PEARCE:
Yes! Very impressive! Very… thorough.
ALB:
You sound surprised.
PEARCE:
You were here when I visited last week, weren’t you?
ALB:
I suppose that’s fair.
PEARCE:
No, compared to the Sorceror General’s staff, the House of Healing runs like gnomish clockwork.
HOLL:
Aw, thank you, Ms Pearcey!
ALB:
Would you like a tour? You can see which items we’ve gotten done so far.
PEARCE:
Gotten done? You’ve actually done things? My word. You’re leaving those wizards in the dust.
ALB:
Holly?
HOLL:
You got it! So this is the reception area…
PEARCE:
I’m familiar, yes.
HOLL:
We’ve cleaned up and moved the desk so it’s easier to get past…
PEARCE:
I saw the new ramp at the front doorstep too, very good.
Holly leads everyone through from room to room.
HOLL:
Through here, the exam room has new easy-to-clean curtains. The lab’s been tidied, cabinets labeled…
MAGNU:
(under his breath)
No, not, not that cupboard…
HOLL:
Glassware and instruments cleaned.
PEARCE:
Good work.
MAGNU:
You bet.
ALB:
Everything’s a bit crowded in here today, unfortunately, but that’s because…
They continue on. The pantry is empty and echoey.
ALB:
The pantry’s been cleared out to make room for the new storage unit.
PEARCE:
They should be delivering it today, in fact.
HOLL:
(sighs)
I’ll miss you, pantry.
ALB:
I know you will. But it’s for safety.
HOLL:
I know.
PEARCE:
How is the one in your office working out?
ALB:
Oh, the cabinet is great. It’s such a relief, finally having all the dangerous magical items protected from unauthorized access.
MAGNU:
Why is everyone looking at me?
ALB:
No reason.
HOLL:
I know why we’re doing it. But I’ll miss all my bottles and jars. I won’t get to write out all the names by hand.
A moment. Alba and Pearcey at a loss.
HOLL:
And… I guess I’m still sad about the garden.
ALB:
I know.
PEARCE:
The garden?
ALB:
A couple of days ago, something came and ate nearly every flower in the herb garden. So we’ve got some replanting to do. And when we bottle the new plants, you can decorate the labels.
HOLL:
Really? Can I? Is that all right, Ms Pearcey?
PEARCE:
(reluctant)
Yes. Fine.
HOLL:
Yay! Thank you!
(pulling up short)
Right, sorry, no hugs.
They continue across the hallway.
PEARCE:
Hmm. Not so good. The hallway is still impassable.
HOLL:
This is just temporary. This will all go into the new unit.
PEARCE:
All right.
MAGNU:
At least the rakes and buckets are gone.
HOLL:
In here, the ward has been swept, scrubbed, smudged and sanitized. We’ve ordered new linens for both beds.
PEARCE:
Very good.
HOLL:
And I think that’s all for inside.
MAGNU:
Yeah, that’s it for inside…
They all return to the exam room.
PEARCE:
Yes. Magnus, you raised the issue of living conditions, and we agree, it would be better to house you somewhere other than…
MAGNU:
A freezing, moldy toolshed?
ALB:
There isn’t any mold.
PEARCE:
We will begin looking for a suitable room within walking distance.
MAGNU:
Define “walking distance”.
PEARCE:
Point seven five miles, or the distance walkable by the average adult in fifteen minutes.
MAGNU:
So… if I find something cheaper further out, can I take a carriage to work?
PEARCE:
Moving right along.
MAGNU:
I mean, you get a carriage.
PEARCE:
Defining roles. We need to assess each of your strengths, and determine where we have gaps to fill.
HOLL:
(hand up)
Ooh. Ooh.
PEARCE:
Yes, Holly.
HOLL:
I’ve been reading about the Persimmon Personality Index!
PEARCE:
I haven’t heard of that one.
HOLL:
At the market the other day, there was a booth for Persimmon Personnel. They do hiring for all those big new companies in town.
PEARCE:
Oh, one of those.
HOLL:
And they created this test, so we can find out what kind of personality and working habits we all have!
ALB:
I don’t think we need a test to tell us that.
Holly has pulled out a cloth bag from under the counter.
HOLL:
They gave me the whole package. Look!
“Know Thyself—Know Thy Employees.” There’s a gem… and a deck of cards… and they’re all different personality archetypes! Don’t you want to know if you’re the Queen of Rubies or the Fire-Eater?
PEARCE:
I’m quite sure this isn’t on the list of approved evaluation tools.
HOLL:
C’mon, it’ll be so perfect. We can discover our unique strengths—in a fun way! Find out what part of our bodies our brains are in!
MAGNU:
Uh…
PEARCE:
Then by all means, try it and see what results you get. On your own time, please.
HOLL:
You have to do it too! Fair’s fair! We want to know your personality, so we know how you like to work and how best to set you up for success in this important transition. What do you think, Alba?
ALB:
I think it’s up to Ms Pearcey.
HOLL:
Please, Ms Pearcey?
PEARCE:
Holly—
HOLL:
Pleeeease?
MAGNU:
I find it’s best just to go with it? Otherwise we’ll be here all day.
PEARCE:
I’m going to regret this. All right, let’s see what we get.
HOLL:
(a delighted squeak)
MUSIC STIN:
INT. OFFICE—MONTAG:
HOLL:
Alba, I want you to look into this sapphire.
ALB:
Really?
HOLL:
It helps to focus your mental waveform.
ALB:
As if there were any such thing.
HOLL:
Just enjoy how pretty and shiny it is. Admire it. Let your conscious mind drift peacefully as you gaze… into the soothing blue depths of… the sapphire…
She falls silent.
ALB:
And at some point I suppose you ask some questions? Holly? Holly.
HOLL:
Right! Questions.
MUSIC STIN:
HOLL:
On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being “completely answer A” and ten being “completely answer B”… Would you say that you are more like a pond or a brick wall?
PEARCE:
What does that even mean?
HOLL:
Just pick one! Go with your instinct.
PEARCE:
My instinct is no. Neither.
HOLL:
All right! I’ll say that’s a five.
PEARCE:
How many questions are there?
MUSIC STIN:
HOLL:
The key is not to overthink your answer. Just say the first thing that comes into your head.
MAGNU:
This is so boring.
HOLL:
Magnus!
MAGNU:
That was the first thing that came into my head.
HOLL:
Magnus. On a scale of zero to ten…
MAGNU:
Seven?
HOLL:
Let me ask the question first!
MAGNU:
…point nine.
HOLL:
Question one.
MAGNU:
Can I say seven point eight three? I’m feeling precise today.
HOLL:
Rrrgh!
MUSIC STIN:
HOLL:
Would you describe yourself as a catalyst or an observer?
PEARCE:
(utterly checked out)
Five.
Holly writes this down.
HOLL:
Do you prefer to set your own hours, or to think about things that could have been?
PEARCE:
Five.
HOLL:
Do you prefer going to a party or falling from a great height?
PEARCE:
Five. No, ten.
HOLL:
Which of these two circles makes you feel more envious?
MUSIC STIN:
MAGNU:
I’m not sure I can even put that in a number.
HOLL:
Just say your first response.
MAGNU:
Hmm. Blue.
HOLL:
As a number.
MAGNU:
Maybe bluey-green. With little swirls of white.
HOLL:
Magnus, stop touching the Sapphire of Assessment.
MAGNU:
I’m not touching it! I’m just putting my hand near it as I focus my brainial waveforms on it.
HOLL:
Stop it!
MAGNU:
Look! I’m not even touching it! I’m not! Look!
HOLL:
Magnus!
MUSIC STIN:
HOLL:
Don’t forget, Alba! Keep looking into the Sapphire.
ALB:
It doesn’t matter where I look.
HOLL:
But it helps to focus the mind.
ALB:
Yes, yes, you’re right.
(under her breath)
I suppose it does keep the violent urges at bay.
HOLL:
Pardon?
ALB:
Nothing, nothing. Three.
MUSIC STIN:
HOLL:
Question thirty-three. Would you rather try new flavours of pie or climb to the top of the tallest mountain?
Well, pie, obviously.
I’ll put that down as a ten! Question thirty-four. Do you prefer being physically active, or making yourself useful?
Can’t I be both?
Five, then? How about five? Hello?
So shiny…
Holly, please pay attention!
Sorry!
She laughs and laughs.
CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING RECEPTION—CONTINUOU:
Holly is still laughing in the background.
MAGNU:
Welp. This is fun.
PEARCE:
I knew it was a bad idea.
ALB:
It’s all part of a learning process.
PEARCE:
How much longer do you think she’s going to be? Perhaps we can get on with some actual business.
The front door opens, and the bell rings. Travin, an awkward 20-something wizard, enters, wheeling a cart.
TRAVI:
Hey. So. I’m looking for Alba?
ALB:
Yes?
TRAVI:
I’m Travin? I’m from Magic Support. I got your new Secure Storage Unit here.
ALB:
Oh good. Thank you.
MAGNU:
That little thing? How is that gonna hold everything in the pantry?
TRAVI:
Oh, the DragonHoard 3C comes compressed. I’m gonna take it out of the packaging, and it’s gonna expand to fill basically the whole room.
MAGNU:
What! That’s so cool.
TRAVI:
Pantry’s back here?
ALB:
Down the hall on your right. You’ll see it.
MAGNU:
Can I watch?
TRAVI:
Sure.
CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING PANTRY—CONTINUOU:
Magnus and Travin wheel the cart down the hall to the pantry and unload a big box.
TRAVI:
Watch out, it’s heavy.
MAGNU:
You’re not kidding!
TRAVI:
So, we just gotta line it up in the very center of the room, so it doesn’t go crooked and damage any walls.
MAGNU:
Right. Makes sense.
TRAVI:
Then just cut this open, slide this off…
He cuts a couple of straps, then pulls away a wooden cover. A soft crackle and hiss, like an air mattress.
MAGNU:
And there it is. How awesome is that?
TRAVI:
Yeah. And now we wait.
MAGNU:
Is it doing anything?
TRAVI:
Takes a while for it to expand to full size.
MAGNU:
Right.
So is this your job, installing these things?
TRAVI:
Any kind of magic fixtures. We got a big project coming up for the Transmutation lab—
Down the hall, the exam room door opens, and Holly emerges. Her voice carries down the hall.
HOLL:
All right, team! Time for our results!
ALB:
Magnus!
MAGNU:
We’re busy!
ALB:
No you’re not. Get in here and get your damn results.
MAGNU:
(sighs)
Fine.
TRAVI:
Trust me, you’re not missing out on anything.
Magnus trudges back to reception.
MAGNU:
(under his breath)
I should have been a wizard. I could totally go to wizard school.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING RECEPTIO:
ALB:
All right, let’s get this over with.
PEARCE:
Yes. I’m due at the Chancellor’s office soon.
MAGNU:
Hey, don’t touch the Sapphire of Assessment, Holly.
HOLL:
I’m the one administering the test. I have to hold the Sapphire to my head like this while I choose the cards. It helps amplify my mental vibrations.
MAGNU:
(snickers)
HOLL:
Who wants to go first?
Silence.
MAGNU:
Fine, I’ll go. This better be good, Holly.
HOLL:
It’s not good or bad. There’s no judgement. It’s a reflection of your true inner self.
MAGNU:
So, like, the King of Hellfire.
Holly turns up a card.
HOLL:
The Princeling of Waters.
MAGNU:
“Princeling”? Seriously?
HOLL:
He’s got a nice hat!
MAGNU:
Aw, man… Even the picture makes him look like a dork. I pronounce your test officially lame.
HOLL:
(reads)
Um… “This card signifies a rebellious spirit who questions authority at every turn.”
ALB:
Well.
MAGNU:
(suddenly liking this)
Tell me more of this fascinating result.
HOLL:
“They struggle against the system and are often resourceful and inventive, even though…”
MAGNU:
…their genius goes unappreciated?
HOLL:
“…they may appear opportunistic and lazy.”
MAGNU:
To the uneducated layperson. Go back to the part about fighting the system?
PEARCE:
I’d hoped the point of this test was to find ways to channel your strengths into positive results for the team.
HOLL:
That’s right.
MAGNU:
No way, baby. I’m sticking it to the man!
ALB:
Yes, you’re quite the rebel.
MAGNU:
You know it.
HOLL:
Okay! Let’s do yours, Alba.
ALB:
All right.
Holly shuffles and deals.
MAGNU:
My money’s on The Old Maid. Of Broomsticks. Or the Tyrant. Is there a Tyrant?
HOLL:
No, it looks like—oh my gosh! The Princeling of Waters.
ALB:
Really.
MAGNU:
What? That’s my card! She can’t have mine!
PEARCE:
That is an amusing coincidence.
HOLL:
Oh, it’s not a coincidence!
MAGNU:
Clearly your cards are stuck or something.
ALB:
I suspect improper shuffling.
PEARCE:
Perhaps the two of you have more in common than you think.
MAGNU:
Like heck.
ALB:
Gods help me.
HOLL:
That’s so interesting…
PEARCE:
Alba, you were a little bit of a terror in your school days, I hear.
ALB:
People say the damnedest things, don’t they?
HOLL:
It’s true, though! Alba, you are resourceful and inventive, and you don’t listen to authority much.
PEARCE:
This will be interesting when we talk about work habits and interpersonal strategies.
ALB:
I’m curious to see what card you get, Ms Pearcey.
PEARCE:
Yes, all right.
MAGNU:
Nobody else better get Princeling of Waters.
Holly deals out another card.
HOLL:
No! It’s The Scribe. “A figure who maintains rational order and values competence, honesty and reliability.” Right? That’s so you!
PEARCE:
(warming to it)
I suppose that’s not a bad description.
HOLL:
“A keeper of knowledge…”
PEARCE:
Hmm! Fair enough.
HOLL:
“…and a keeper of secrets.”
ALB:
Secrets?
HOLL:
Ooh, that sounds mysterious.
PEARCE:
(hastily)
It just means that I’m trustworthy, obviously, and am often privy to official secrets by virtue of my position.
HOLL:
(lightly)
You don’t have any deep, dark secrets, Ms Pearcey?
ALB:
Yes, do tell.
PEARCE:
Well!
Holly, let’s find out what personality type you are.
HOLL:
Okay!
MAGNU:
Can you trust this test if you ran it on yourself?
ALB:
It’s probably just as useful as everyone else’s results.
Holly turns over a card.
MAGNU:
“The Queen of the Wind”?
HOLL:
Aw, that does sound like me!
She flutters her wings.
MAGNU:
Careful with those wings, O Queen.
HOLL:
Sorry, I just got excited! Let’s see. Oooh! “A spirit with a deep connection to the primal forces of nature.”
ALB:
That’s one way of putting it.
HOLL:
“A dynamic personality…”
(her excitement drains away)
“…who is fated to bring doom and destruction.”
Beat.
MAGNU:
Ha ha!
ALB:
That sounds about right, actually.
HOLL:
No, it can’t be. I’m a good fairy and I help people!
MAGNU:
(mocking laughter)
Bringer of doom!
HOLL:
Magnus, this is me we’re talking about! I’d never bring doom!
MAGNU:
Who almost got us eaten by bears?
HOLL:
That wasn’t my fault! I was starving and they had porridge!
PEARCE:
Bears?
ALB:
I seem to remember a fair number of lab explosions.
HOLL:
Magnus brings on way more doom than I do.
MAGNU:
(scoffs)
PEARCE:
All right. We can’t take this test too seriously. This is simply a mildly entertaining game to spark conversation.
HOLL:
But… I looked into the Sapphire. Do you think it sensed a mental vibration from deep in my spirit that I’ve been hiding from all this time?
ALB:
I think it tells us a lot of random traits that could match anyone.
HOLL:
I’m scared, Ms Pearcey.
MAGNU:
Yeah, I dunno… maybe you should take the rest of the day off. You know, just in case.
HOLL:
In case what?
MAGNU:
In case you have a mental vibration.
HOLL:
You’re a mental vibration.
There’s a crackle, then a huge BLAM! from the pantry.
ALB:
What the hell was that?
HOLL:
Oh no!
Travin appears in the doorway.
TRAVI:
(coughing)
So… slight problem with the install.
ALB:
What happened?
HOLL:
Oh my gosh. It’s happening already.
TRAVI:
I think we might have mis-measured the amount of free space.
PEARCE:
What?! Is anything damaged?
TRAVI:
I mean… little bit. Just might need to get someone in to look at the walls, and make sure they’re still sound.
PEARCE:
This is unacceptable. Show me.
TRAVI:
Well, you know, sometimes these old buildings, they expand and contract with the cold…
Pearcey, Travin and Magnus follow him to the back hallway.
HOLL:
(whispers)
It’s all my fault.
ALB:
Holly…
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING HALLWA:
Dust and debris settle.
PEARCE:
Did you double-check the measurements before you opened the package?
TRAVI:
(guilty)
Yeah!
PEARCE:
Did you?
TRAVI:
I… I mean…
MAGNU:
Yeah, he totally did. I saw him.
PEARCE:
I see.
MAGNU:
Can’t you just shrink it?
PEARCE:
No, he can’t. Once installed, it’s proof against most types of magic. And even if we did shrink it, I don’t trust this building to stay standing now.
TRAVI:
It’s really not that bad.
PEARCE:
I’m going to talk to the head of your department, young man. And they need to get the emergency team down here on the double. Come on, let’s clear the building.
(calls)
Everyone out! Holly? Ms Salix? Hello?
MUSIC STIN:
EXT. FOREST—DA:
Holly is crouched under a tree. Alba approaches softly.
HOLL:
I’m a monster. I bring doom and destruction everywhere I go.
ALB:
I thought I might find you here.
HOLL:
Alba, no. You can’t be around me. It’s not safe.
ALB:
Holly, you pulled a random card out of a deck.
HOLL:
And then the whole House of Healing nearly fell down!
ALB:
It didn’t. And it certainly wasn’t your fault.
HOLL:
I brought this on us, Alba.
ALB:
You did no such bloody thing. It was that so-called wizard from the Ministry. He didn’t measure properly. He didn’t even install the unit with the door facing out.
You are a good fairy and you help people.
HOLL:
That’s just a thing I say to make myself feel better.
ALB:
It’s true. You are good. You’re good because you care. That’s who you are. That’s something to be proud of.
So take it easy today. Pearcey’s not letting us back in the building anyway. Go get some rest.
HOLL:
Thanks, Alba.
ALB:
See you in the morning.
MUSIC STIN:
EXT. HOUSE OF HEALING GARDEN—DA:
Magnus and Travin survey the damage.
TRAVI:
They’re being so stupid. The building’s gonna be fine. It’s just a little plaster off the walls.
MAGNU:
I know, right? That Pearcey is such a tightass.
TRAVI:
Yeah. Oh, hey, thanks for covering for me in there.
MAGNU:
You got it, dude. Oh, shoot, that reminds me.
TRAVI:
What’s up?
MAGNU:
While you’re here, Alba wanted me to ask you about a problem with the cabinet in her office.
TRAVI:
That’s the DragonHoard 11S?
MAGNU:
Yeah, the big new shiny red one?
TRAVI:
(sighs)
What’s wrong with it?
MAGNU:
It’s kinda dumb. We forgot the password. You know, we’re supposed to choose one that’s hard to guess, and Pearcey’s all like, “No, you can’t write it down!”
TRAVI:
Well, I mean, that’s good practice, but yeah.
MAGNU:
I wanna say it was something like “double, double, toil and trouble” but it’s not working. Any way you can tell what Alb… what we set it to?
TRAVI:
No, there’s no way to find out. But… if you want, I can reset the password, and you can just choose a new one.
MAGNU:
Really? That would be amazing.
TRAVI:
Oh yeah, it’s no problem.
MAGNU:
You’re saving my life, man. Seriously.
MUSIC STIN:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING OFFIC:
Magnus hunts through the cabinet.
MAGNU:
Oo, nice wand.
Amulet… boring.
Teapot… lame.
Heyyy, now this looks demonic.
He flips through a book.
MAGNU:
Dammit, I gotta learn me some languages.
Whoa, that’s… graphic. Ugh.
Magnus shuts the book quickly.
He pulls out a big knife and unsheaths it.
MAGNU:
Oh ho ho. You beautiful, beautiful thing.
He swishes it through the air a few times.
MAGNU:
Ohh, that is so cool. Yeah. You probably got a name, like Blade of the Night… Sky Talon… Drinker of Souls.
The blade emits scorching, crackling flames.
MAGNU:
No way! Alba, where did you get this awesome knife?
He swings it around some more, causing great whooshes of flame.
MAGNU:
Aw yeah.
Aw yeah.
And inevitably, sets some of the nearby papers on fire.
MAGNU:
Oh crap. Oh crap crap crap.
He runs around trying to beat out the flames.
MAGNU:
Okay. Okay. Everything’s gonna be fine. It wasn’t even me! I wasn’t even here. Oh gods I’m so dead.
From the next room comes the sound of the front door bell.
MAGNU:
Aaa!
HOLL:
(calls)
Hello? Who’s here?
She runs in just as Magnus puts out the last of the fire.
HOLL:
Magnus! What are you doing in here?
MAGNU:
Me? I’m… Nothing! What are you doing in here?
HOLL:
I saw lights inside and—oh my gosh! What did you do?
MAGNU:
Nothing!
HOLL:
Yeah, right. I knew you’d be up to something.
MAGNU:
What do you mean? I saw the fire too and I came in to fight it.
HOLL:
Why is the red cabinet open?
MAGNU:
Uh… because of the fire, it popped open. Like popcorn.
HOLL:
Uh huh? Who’s causing doom and destruction now?
MAGNU:
The fire’s out! There was hardly any destruction.
HOLL:
Except for Alba’s papers.
MAGNU:
I know. Oh geez. You gotta help me hide them.
HOLL:
No! We have to get out of here! The building’s not safe.
MAGNU:
Travin says the building is totally fine.
HOLL:
Like he’d know.
MAGNU:
He’s a wizard. He knows stuff.
HOLL:
Magnus, just close the cabinet and let’s go.
There’s a faint tapping sound.
MAGNU:
Wait. What’s that noise?
HOLL:
Magnus, leave it!
MAGNU:
It’s coming from inside this bag.
He picks up a heavy cloth bag and opens it. The tapping turns into fluttering: something small battering its wings against the inside of a glass jar.
HOLL:
Stop touching things! Do you want to bring doom and—aww, it’s a little butterfly!
MAGNU:
Holly…
HOLL:
Oh no, he’s stuck. Well, thank goodness we got that fire put out. He could have been killed!
MAGNU:
Holly, why does Alba have a butterfly in a jar? In a bag? In the back of a magic-proof locked cabinet?
HOLL:
Exactly. I’m going to have a word with her when she comes back. Look at his tiny face! He’s so sad.
MAGNU:
But don’t you think he might be dangerous too? Or is Alba secretly evil?
HOLL:
He’s just a butterfly. Just hang on, little guy.
MAGNU:
How do you even know it’s a he?
HOLL:
My people train butterflies.
MAGNU:
To do what? Harvest nectar? Carry flower petals?
HOLL:
On Midsummer’s Day they dance! You should see it—fairies and butterflies turning the sky into fountains of colour!
MAGNU:
…Right.
HOLL:
Here you go, buddy. You’re free!
She opens the lid. A tiny patter of feet on the glass.
MAGNU:
You gonna dance for us, Mister Butterfly?
BUTTERFL:
(a tiny, growling voice)
No.
Shocked silence.
MAGNU:
You talk?
HOLL:
Oh my gosh, you do talk. Hello! My name’s Holly.
BUTTERFL:
I will not dance for you, Holly.
HOLL:
That’s okay! You don’t have to.
BUTTERFL:
The two of you are going to dance for me.
MAGNU:
Shyeah right. Last animal who told me to dance, I got out a shovel and I—
He’s cut short by a blast of lighting.
MAGNU:
OW! Holy dangit it to heck in a—ow!
Tiny fluttering wings. Another blast.
BUTTERFL:
Dance, human! Come on! Ha ha ha ha!
MAGNU:
Aaa! Stop that! Holly!
HOLL:
It’s okay, Mister Butterfly!
MAGNU:
Get this thing away from me!
HOLL:
Magnus, be nice! He’s not a “thing”.
MAGNU:
He shoots lightning!
HOLL:
He’s just disoriented.
MAGNU:
Lightning, Holly!
BUTTERFL:
Did I hear right, fairy? You enslave my people?
HOLL:
What? We don’t enslave! It’s artistic collaboration!
BUTTERFL:
Lies!
Another crackle of lightning.
HOLL:
Aaa! That’s not nice. I just rescued you!
MAGNU:
Yeah, what were you doing in that jar, anyway?
BUTTERFL:
She imprisoned me. The human hag. Said she didn’t want me in her garden. She would have me go hungry, she would!
HOLL:
What? No! We have plenty of nice flowers you can drink from. Or… we did until yesterday, anyway.
BUTTERFL:
Drink from the flowers? Oh no. Nectar is sweet. But now I feed on something far sweeter—pure beauty!
MAGNU:
What does that mean?
HOLL:
It was you that ate all the flowers?
BUTTERFL:
(chuckles)
Oh, they were delicious. And all the lovely shiny beetles and ladybugs…
HOLL:
(gasps)
MAGNU:
Since when do butterflies eat ladybugs?
BUTTERFL:
I would have had that pretty little bunny rabbit, too, if that evil witch hadn’t caught me.
MAGNU:
You? Eat a bunny rabbit? I’d like to see that.
The butterfly gives a monstrous screech.
HOLL:
Eeek!
MAGNUS (SIMULTANEOUS)
Whoa! Whoa, teeth!
BUTTERFL:
That could be arranged.
MAGNU:
Nope! Nope, don’t need to see that!
HOLL:
You ate Alba’s flowers and herbs and all the little bugs, and she’s the evil one? I don’t think so!
The butterfly flaps about, gnashing his sharp teeth.
BUTTERFL:
Soon I shall feast upon her bones. But first, I shall feast upon yours, fairy!
A flash of lighting.
MAGNU:
Whoa! Help! Fire!
BUTTERFL:
I shall drink your tears.
HOLL:
Stop it!
BUTTERFL:
Fear me! I am Pelipaghh the Devourer!
HOLL:
Yeah, well, I’m… I’m Holly, the Queen of the Wind!
Holly’s voice grows low and fierce as she takes to the air too. Wind howls around her, and lightning scorches the room.
BUTTERFL:
I do not fear the little minions of the witch.
HOLL:
We’re not minions! We’re staff!
BUTTERFL:
You serve her whims.
HOLL:
Come here, you!
Another bolt of lightning.
BUTTERFL:
Ha ha ha!
HOLL:
Get back in your jar!
The wind grows louder.
MAGNU:
Holly! What the heck? Are you doing that?
The butterfly screams in terror as he is swept into the middle of a whirlwind.
BUTTERFL:
Aaaaa! No! Let me go!
HOLL:
(low and terrifying)
I am Queen of the Wind. I bring doom and destruction! Starting with you!
BUTTERFL:
Noooo!
MAGNU:
Holly!
HOLL:
Magnus, get the jar.
MAGNU:
Right. Right.
BUTTERFL:
Aaaaaa!
The whirlwind deposits the frantic butterfly in the jar, which Magnus quickly corks.
MAGNU:
Got him. Thank the gods. Here. One evil butterfly.
HOLL:
Say you’re sorry!
BUTTERFL:
(panting, defeated)
I will not! Filthy fairy!
HOLL:
Say it!
BUTTERFL:
No! You can imprison me but you can never—aaaaaa!
Holly shakes the jar, rattling the butterfly around inside. She laughs madly.
BUTTERFL:
Okay, okay! I’m sorry! Aaa!
MAGNU:
Whoa, whoa, let’s all calm down. Queen of the Wind, I got it.
HOLL:
What’s that? I can’t hear you!
BUTTERFL:
I’m sorry! Uncle!
MAGNU:
Holly, why don’t we, uh, just put him back in the cabinet?
BUTTERFL:
Yeah. Yeah. I’ll go back in the cabinet. It’s good. I’ll be good.
Still breathing hard from the fight, Holly and Magnus stuff the jar back into the bag and shut it back in the cabinet.
MAGNU:
That was amazing, Holly. I didn’t know you could do that.
HOLL:
(softly)
Neither did I. Gosh.
MAGNU:
Totally badass.
HOLL:
Thanks.

Wow.
Something tinkles to the floor.

So dead.

She pulls out a heavy book and flips through it as Holly bursts in.
HOLL:
Hey Alba! We’ve been summoned to the Palace.
ALB:
Is it Her Majesty again?
HOLL:
Yup! Time to check on the royal baby.
ALB:
Which sadly means we have to check on the royal mother-to-be. And I was so looking forward to curling up with these interior signage regulations. All right.
Alba tosses the book down.

She pushes her chair back and stands.

Yes, your Loudness. What is it.

Why are you under the desk?

It’s not my fault. It was those damn fairies… and all their prancing…

I need you to cover reception, Magnus.
MAGNU:
Can’t we just close for the day?
ALB:
No, we can’t. What’s wrong with you now?
Holly comes back in with a bag.

Oh, look, there he is.
Magnus came with me to the fairy circle celebration last night!
ALB:
Magnus did?
HOLL:
Yes! He ate all the fairy cakes…
MAGNU:
Well, you guys should have stopped me.
HOLL:

And then he made fun of everyone, knocked over one of the stones and threw up on my friend Starlight.
MAGNU:
Ughhh. My head hurts.
HOLL:
It serves you right!
ALB:
Magnus, pull yourself together. Holly and I are off to the Palace.
MAGNU:
All right, all right, all right. I got it. I’ll hold down the fort.

Thank you.

Parabel’s footsteps.
ALB:
I can’t examine you if you keep pacing like that.
PARABEL
I think better when I am pacing.
ALB:
Well, if you pace less, you might think less, and it might spare us from any more decrees about pink buildings. Sit. Holly?
HOLL:
Pink is nice!
ALB:
I meant, bring me the Sceptre of Sanela.
HOLL:
Oh right. You got it.
PARABEL
Your snide remarks aside… it’s good you are here. I’ve been thinking about how to serve those in need. How the few must sacrifice so that the many might flourish.
ALB:
(under her breath)
Artena, grant me strength.
PARABEL
How the poor, grubby masses rely on us for their guidance and safety.
ALB:
Mm hmmm.
HOLL:
Here you go, Alba.
PARABEL
How one Queen must rise above her people.
ALB:
Well, you’ve got that part down.
Sound of magic building.
PARABEL
Yes. I have risen to what my station demands of me. With this crown comes great responsibili—ouch!
The magic cuts off with a crackle.
ALB:
Hold still!
PARABEL
I’ve been holding still for you all morning! I need an answer.
ALB:
We’re not calling a coin toss here. It’s complicated at the best of times. And the earlier we do it, the less reliable the scrying.
PARABEL
The scry-ing or the scry-er?
ALB:
(mutters)
Well, Your Majesty’s temperament is completely normal.
PARABEL
What was that?
ALB:
Your humours are as well balanced as ever, your Majesty.
PARABEL
I should hire a proper physician.
I need to know if my child is a boy or a girl.
ALB:
All the readings so far are somewhere in the middle. It could be either. Or neither. Which is why we need to recalibrate the Sceptre. It’s a very sensitive piece of—
Another rush of magic. Part of the sceptre falls off and clatters on the floor.
HOLL:
I’m sorry, Alba! It’s like it jumped out of my hand.
ALB:
It’s fine. Just bring me the backup calibrator from the bag.
PARABEL
I’ll cancel my next appointment, shall I?
HOLL:
Here you go, Alba.
Magic builds and then dies with a clunk.
ALB:
Oh, now what?
PARABEL
Well?
A clicking sound.
HOLL:
I just charged it!
PARABEL
(stands)
Enough. I need to know the sex of this child, Alba.
ALB:
Yes, yes. There’s so much planning to do for the baby shower.
PARABEL
(paces to the window)
You don’t know the half of it.
ALB:
Holly, hold the sceptre. I’m going to replace the power stone.
HOLL:
Holding on!
PARABEL
(alone, gripping the windowsill)
I see it coming. A darkness that consumes everything it touches. Kingdom by kingdom it stalks us. Until only we remain, blissfully ignorant as the mouse before the cobra strikes. Their puppet prince hungry to rule and no legitimate heir in sight…
A snap and a shower of sparks.
ALB:
Dammit!
HOLL:
Oh my gosh.
All our equipment is failing. It’s like the baby doesn’t want us to know.
ALB:
It’s an embryo, Holly, not a sorcerer.
All right, let’s do this the old-fashioned way.
HOLL:
A resonating salve?
ALB:
Yes.
Parabel, the salve we’re going to use tests the physical signs only, so it’s not always reliable at this stage—and you’re not even listening.
PARABEL
Can you see them, sister? My subjects. How they scurry to attend to their duty, ignorant of the predator watching from the shadows. Such mindless little things, grovelling before their queen like… like ants, with those horrid little antenna things.
ALB:
I thought we were mice.
PARABEL
Ugh!
HOLL:
(whispers)
Alba, human babies don’t have antennae, do they?
ALB:
Not typically.
HOLL:
Oh. Phew! I thought I’d missed something.
ALB:
Lie back, please, Your Majesty. And hold the royal garments up over your belly, thank you.
Holly opens a bottle.
HOLL:
Sorry, Your Majesty. I didn’t have time to warm the salve up.
PARABEL
It’s no matter.
(a sharp breath in)
A shimmer of magic, more subtle and stable.
HOLL:
Oh, wow. It’s starting to glow already!
ALB:
So it is.
Well, Your Majesty, you can break out the fireworks and the good napkins.
PARABEL
It’s… good news?
HOLL:
Hooray!
ALB:
It’s a boy.
PARABEL
What?!
ALB:
As I said, it’s not one hundred percent reliable at this stage, but it appears your baby is male in body, with all the dangling bits required by ancient custom to profess your child an heir to the throne.
PARABEL
No. No!
HOLL:
Your Majesty!
PARABEL
Get away from me.
HOLL:
I’m so sorry! Do you want a towel for the salve?
Parabel snatches the towel from Holly.
PARABEL
Alba. Listen to me. You must help me to hide this and speak of this to no one.
ALB:
I know you had your heart set on having a third daughter of a third daughter of a third daughter. But for heaven’s sake—
PARABEL
For once in your misspent life, listen to me! Our kingdom hangs by a thread! We must hide the sex of this child from everyone, forever!
ALB:
What kind of life is that going to be? Parabel, come on. Sit down. Would you like a sedative? Holly, get a sedative.
PARABEL
Ha! I’m just hysterical, is that it, sister?
ALB:
Parabel, what’s gotten into you?
PARABEL
Only concern for my child and my people.
Scurry elsewhere. You are dismissed!
Parabel flows out of the room.
ALB:
(sighs)
As usual.

PEARCE:
Oh no, what time is it?
LORI:
(yawns)
We should probably get up.
Pearcey is already up. She runs around the room getting dressed.
PEARCE:
We’ve overslept.
LORI:
You needed your rest! You were up all night working.
PEARCE:
When is my first appointment?
LORI:
Your morning is open.
Tally-cakes. Relax. You’ve got to treat yourself better than this. Slow down. You’ve got your shirt on inside out.
PEARCE:
Oh… hells.
LORI:
Or you could leave it off.
PEARCE:
(laughs)
Be good. We have work to do.
LORI:
We tamed a fleet of dragons. Wizards should be easy.
Pearcey pours water into a basin to wash her face.
PEARCE:
Ugh. It’s all the bowing that gets me.
“Ah, Minister, you enlighten us SO with your interesting suggestions.” “Ah Minister, you see with such brilliance and clarity, for a commoner.”
LORI:
Commoner? Did they say that?
PEARCE:
Oh yes. Just yesterday.
They’re all waiting it out, praying that I’m just going to disappear in a puff of smoke. And then they can get back to their incestuous, nepotistic old-wizard-club ways.
LORI:
You do like a good challenge…
PEARCE:
I suppose I do.
Who is today’s first audience?
LORI:
Oh… Let me think.
PEARCE:
Or perhaps we should get our little bottom out of bed and check the diary?
LORI:
Well, that’s no fun!
PEARCE:
Exactly. There will be no fun in my department!
She tickles Loria, who springs out of bed.
LORI:
Eek! Help!
(laughing)
No fun! I promise!
Screaming and laughter as Pearcey chases Loria around the room.
LORI:
Okay, okay! I have the diary! Stop!
PEARCE:
And our first audience…?
LORI:
Is… the Office of Dissipation, Viticulture and Profligate Expenditures.
PEARCE:
Well. This has all the tell-tale signs of a truly stupendous day.
LORI:
(in her snooty, professional voice)
Shall I fetch your robes of office?
PEARCEY.
(snooty too)
Yes. And my reading lenses.
And a ledger, doesn’t matter which. I want them to think I’m reviewing their spending.
LORI:
At once, Minister. You enlighten us SO with your wisdom…
PEARCE:
Ms Berenice. Are you making fun?
LORI:
Nope! No fun.
PEARCE:
Oh, and has King Gunther sent word about my request?
LORI:
Which request?
PEARCE:
To hire an additional staff member? You did send it.
LORI:
I think… Oh wait. Yeah, I did!
PEARCE:
Loria.
LORI:
I don’t memorize every note that lands on my desk. If you’re going to be grumpy, you can write your own requests.
She stalks off.
PEARCE:
(takes a deep breath)
I’m sorry, I’m just overwhelmed lately. The King expects me to overhaul a department I know next to nothing about and refuses to send me any assistance.
LORI:
(clears her throat)
PEARCE:
My little L‑Bear, your assistance goes above and beyond the call of duty.
I speak of a need for one with less fire and duller claws.
LORI:
(purrs)
Meow!
PEARCE:
And less temptation! Now get dressed!
A knock at the door.
PEARCE:
Now what?
We follow Pearcey to the front hall. She opens the door.
TRAVI:
Hey…
PEARCE:
Yes? Oh, it’s… Travin, isn’t it?
TRAVI:
Yeah. Hey. Package for you from Magic Support.
PEARCE:
(with withering sarcasm)
Oh good. What new wonder do you have for me today?
TRAVI:
It’s this…
PEARCE:
A rock.
TRAVI:
Plus a note from the king.
PEARCE:
The king? What’s the note?
TRAVI:
Let’s see…
(clears throat)
He unfolds a letter. Crossfade to Gunther as he writes the message at his desk.
TRAVIN AND GUNTHE:
“His Majesty King Gunther the Third hereby acknowledges on the 23rd day of this month of the Rooster, that he has received your—”
PEARCE:
Is there any way you might be able to get to the actual message in this message?
TRAVI:
Yeah, sorry.
GUNTHE:
Most rude. Where was I? Oh yes.
The Office of Appropriations has come up with a firecracker of an idea: out-sourcing! I believe I have that right. We get the people we need but only pay a fraction of the normal costs. This is a great boon, as now we should be able to afford that state banquet next week. And those dancers from Vanyaco I’ve been so looking forward to.
(clears throat, gets back on track)
With that in mind, please accept this new Spectral Assistant, which I trust will serve you well.
His Royal Majesty, Gunther the Third, King of Farloria and benevolent protector of—
PEARCE:
Yes. Got it. Much obliged. Is he sending someone or not?
TRAVI:
Yeah. That’s what this is.
PEARCE:
This is a rock.
TRAVI:
Yeah, so that’s your Spectral Assistant. The rock is just the hardware. Like, the physical thing it’s bound to.
Silence.
PEARCE:
No. No, we’re done. You and your rock are dismissed.
She starts to shut the door.
TRAVI:
Oh no, c’mon, wait. I’m supposed to deliver this to you. If I don’t, my manager is gonna be on my case.
PEARCE:
Fine. Give it here. Just tell me it’s not going to go haywire and knock down the building.
TRAVI:
Uh… it shouldn’t.
PEARCE:
Good. Thank you.
TRAVI:
You’re welcome, Madam—
Pearcey shuts the door in his face.
LORI:
What is that?
PEARCEY.
Don’t ask.
The calm, even voice of Leon Stamatis (of the podcast Greater Boston) emerges from the rock.
LEO:
Ah, good day.
PEARCE:
(screams and drops the rock)
LEO:
My name is Leon, and I have been assigned to you by the Incorporeal Workers’ Union as part of my afterlife release program.
LORI:
A talking rock?
PEARCE:
Childish. Do I have Travin to thank for this hilarious joke? Or some other short-sighted, pointy-hatted imbecile?
LEO:
I assure you that this is no prank, Minister.
LORI:
You did say you wanted someone solid…
PEARCE:
Don’t you start too. I need dependable assistance, not a rock.
LEO:
There is nothing more solid and dependable than a rock. Rocks have stood the test of time, witnessing the rise and fall of countless civilizations. They are the very definition of dependable.
LORI:
Right. So how do you assist?
LEO:
This piece of obsidian has been tuned and updated to run Igneous 4.2.1. It acts as an anchor for my Prescient Outsourced Presence.
PEARCE:
No. I don’t have time for this.
LEO:
You are correct. I have taken the liberty of updating your schedule accordingly.
PEARCE:
You what?
LEO:
Today, 8 to 8:30am.
Finish getting dressed. Smart and formal attire. Consider wearing that new jacket, but settle instead on the robes of office.
9 to 9:45am.
Answer summons from Queen Parabel about state of the kingdom (anticipated).
PEARCE:
The Queen?
LORI:
What?
PEARCE:
“No morning appointments” indeed.
LORI:
You don’t have an appointment with the Queen. I swear!
LEO:
11 to 11:15am.
Stop for food in the kitchens on the way to the Wizard’s Council. Council won’t start on time because wizards.
2 to 4pm.
Summon Alba Salix. Skip small talk. Address her team’s failure to meet each and every touchstone. Be firm but understanding. Guide her to an action plan that doesn’t involve murdering members of her staff.
6:30 to 9pm.
Dinner with Loria. Fettucine Portayo and braised Brassica sprouts. Dancing to follow.
LORI:
Hmm!
LEO:
9 to 10pm.
Sex with Loria (anticipated). Suggest a “spontaneous” role-play scenario: naughty riding instructor…
LORI:
(bursts out laughing)
PEARCE:
All right! That’s quite enough.
LORI:
Oh, I like this rock.
PEARCE:
Very well. Mister…?
LEO:
Leon. Just Leon.
PEARCE:
Mister Leon, I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but I’m going to try you out.
(lifts the rock)
Oof. I don’t suppose they make any spectral assistant pebbles?
> MUSIC STIN:
EXT. ROAD FROM THE PALACE, DA:
Sounds of the town fade into the distance as Alba and Holly walk.
ALB:
We’ll have to replace that sceptre too. Hopefully it’s still under warranty.
HOLL:
Alba… do you think the Queen will be okay?
ALB:
She’ll be fine. It’s the baby I feel sorry for. If anything could mess a kid up more than being raised by Parabel…
HOLL:
Humans get awfully wound up about who’s a girl and who’s a boy.
ALB:
It’s true. She flew completely off the handle when little Coralyn decided she wanted to wear trousers.
HOLL:
Is she right about the Balgomarians, though? If it is a boy, is the baby going to be in danger?
ALB:
Who knows? I doubt it. Her Majesty is always being overdramatic. The Theatre Guild should give her a lifetime achievement award.
HOLL:
(suddenly gasps)
Oh no! Something’s on fire!
ALB:
Exactly. Or “Oh no! Which of my hundred dresses shall I wear?”
HOLL:
No, the House of Healing! I think it’s on fire!
Holly flies off as Alba breaks into a run.
ALB:
What?! Oh gods. What’s that idiot boy done now?
CUT TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
A raging fire. The sound of rushing water and bandits yelling and pounding on the far side of an interior door.
BANDIT:
Boss! What do we do? Help!
MAGNU:
It’s working. Ha ha, listen to them!
JEROM:
I don’t know, Magnus…
MAGNU:
No, no! Jerome, do not get up! We have to keep the door shut!
The pounding grows weaker and stops as the water on the far side of the door rises.
JEROM:
We’re not… killing them, are we?
MAGNU:
It’s just a little water. They’re bandits! Brigands! They can swim!
BANDIT 1
(from inside)
Help! I can’t swim!
MAGNU:
Or I guess that’s pirates. Pirates can probably swim.
Alba throws open the front door.
ALB:
(gasps)
What is going on in here!?
JEROME AND MAGNU:
Alba!
ALB:
What’s burning?
HOLL:
The appointment book! Why it is on fire?!
ALB:
Does it matter why? Put it out!
MAGNU:
It’s okay, boss! Everything is under control!
Holly puts out the fire.
HOLL:
Agh! There we go.
ALB:
Get out of my way, Jerome.
MAGNU:
No no, he’s holding the door closed!
ALB:
Why? What’s going on in the back?
HOLL:
And why is the door bulging like that?
A dangerous creaking. A hinge flies off with a bang.
JEROM:
The hinges are giving out! Save yourselves!
He leaps up and runs for safety outside. The door to the operating room bursts open, sending cubic tons of water flooding outwards.
EXT. GARDEN—CONTINUOU:
Alba, Magnus, Holly and Jerome all scream as they are carried out into the garden. All of them cough and sputter.
MAGNU:
Did we get ’em?
Ahoy! Bandits! Show yourselves!
He runs back in the front door, footsteps sloshing.
HOLL:
Oh, my wings! Alba? Alba, where are you?
JEROM:
She’s up in the tree. Alba! Are you okay?
HOLL:
Just hang on! I’ll come and get you!
ALB:
(shouts down)
I’ll be right down. After I finish counting to a hundred.
Magnus emerges from the building again.
MAGNU:
Where the heck did they go? Jerome, did you see any of them?
JEROM:
Uh… no, there’s nobody here.
HOLL:
See who? Magnus, were there patients inside?!
MAGNU:
No, they weren’t patients. They were brigands!
JEROM:
I guess they got out?
MAGNU:
But how? The window in the lab is tiny!
ALB:
Oh, Magnus… can I have a word with you?
MAGNU:
Oh man. Alba. You wouldn’t believe what happened, but lucky for you, Magnus was here to save the day—
ALB:
Potes volare!
Sound of magic lifting Magnus into the air.
MAGNU:
Whoa! Hey! Put me down!
Listen, it was Guy van Fleet!
ALB:
Guy van Fleet, the highwayman.
MAGNU:
No, Guy van Fleet the undertaker! Yes, of course it was—
ALB:
Guy van Fleet came here.
MAGNU:
Yes! He attacked the House of Healing! It’s true!
ALB:
Magnus, I am done with your lies, your disobedience, your attitude, your disregard for safety and constantly having to—
HOLL:
Alba… there is a sword here. No… two swords.
MAGNU:
See, I told you! Guy was here with fifty men! Jerome, back me up here.
JEROM:
Well, I don’t think it was fifty…
MAGNU:
Exactly, it was more like a hundred! It was a siege.
ALB:
Enough.
A whistle of magic as Magnus is carried away, his yelling diminishing into the distance.
MAGNU:
Listen, I’m the victim here! Albaaa!
HOLL:
Alba, what if Magnus is telling the truth?
ALB:
Well, then, he can have a nice, refreshing dip in the leech pond.
In the distance, Magnus yelps as he tumbles into the water.
> MUSIC STIN:
INT. LABORATOR:
Water drips in the background.
ALB:
Look at this mess. We were gone for less than an hour!
JEROM:
Oh boy. I’m sorry, Alba. Can I help sweep up?
ALB:
I expect something like this from Magnus. But you, Jerome?
JEROM:
I just stopped by to get a refill of that potion you gave me for my insomnia—
ALB:
Save it. I’m done. Finis. Factum. No more nice witch. Clear the lab bench, Holly.
HOLL:
Okay. Do you want me to put all these bottles in the back room, or—
ALB:
Never mind.
She sweeps all the items off the table.
HOLL:
Alba! Are you okay?
Alba begins gathering ingredients.
ALB:
Oh yes. I’m beyond okay, Holly. I’m done being trifled with, dismissed and ignored. Lock your doors and hide your children! The witch is back.
HOLL:
Alba?
ALB:
Holly, go fetch Magnus out of the pond. We’re off to visit Minister Pearcey.
> MUSIC STIN:
INT. MINISTRY OFFIC:
A clock ticks.
PEARCE:
Shall we begin?
ALB:
Yes, let’s. I brought a little something along to aid our investigation.
She places a bottle on the table.
PEARCE:
And this is?
ALB:
A truth potion.
MAGNU:
Why do you not trust me?
I mean, sure, maybe I… stretched the truth on previous occasions. But this is serious! This all really happened!
ALB:
Well then, you won’t mind giving your evidence under the influence of a truth serum.
MAGNU:
If that’s what it is.
ALB:
Minister?
PEARCE:
I’ll permit it.
ALB:
Go ahead, Magnus.
MAGNU:
Yeah? How do I know it’s not, like, fireweed extract?
PEARCE:
Magnus, please do as you’re asked.
MAGNU:
This stuff could be hemlock, for all you know.
JEROM:
Alba wouldn’t do that!
MAGNU:
Pfft. Well, you drink it, then!
JEROM:
Okay!
ALB:
Jerome, no, don’t—!
Too late. He uncorks the bottle and downs it.
JEROM:
Mmm! That’s nice.
ALB:
Jerome, I swear to all the gods…
JEROM:
It tastes like that Frinozipax stuff you were prescribing last year.
PEARCE:
What’s Frinozipax?
JEROM:
Why, it’s an all-natural herbal potion made from—
ALB:
(sharply)
Let’s begin our questioning.
JEROM:
(feeling the effects and totally enamoured with Alba)
Yes! I’m ready to be interrogated, Alba.
PEARCE:
It’s not an interrogation. It’s an interview.
MAGNU:
Pfff. Yeah, you leave the room and see how fast this turns into an interrogation.
PEARCE:
Come to think of it, I could use a coffee. Alba?
ALB:
Yes please. Interviewing does work up quite a thirst.
Pearcey heads for the door.
PEARCE:
Two sugars?
MAGNU:
No! You can’t leave me alone with her. Look, we’re talking! We have nothing to hide!
She sits back down.
PEARCE:
Good. Then why don’t we begin at the beginning. You say several bandits broke into the House of Healing?
MAGNU:
Yes, I say that, because they did.
ALB:
Why did they have to break in? We were supposed to be open for business.
MAGNU:
Well… okay, maybe they didn’t break in. But they took me by surprise!
ALB:
Were you perhaps asleep at reception?
MAGNU:
I object! That’s not germane to this investigation!
ALB:
(clears her throat)
MAGNU:
Okay! Okay! Yes, I was at the desk. And I may have closed my eyes, just for a second. The next thing I knew, I was surrounded by all these bandits…
CROSSFADE TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
Footsteps. Several swords are drawn.
GU:
Don’t make me tell you again.
BANDIT 3
Yeah, don’t make the boss tell you again. Drop the letter opener.
Magnus drops it.
MAGNU:
Heh. Okay. Look, let’s just talk this over like good, decent fellow outlaws. You know I’m totally your guy, Guy!
GU:
Bind him and secure the rest of the building.
Guy heads down the back hallway as the bandits tie Magnus up..
BANDIT 4
Hold still, kid.
MAGNU:
Owwww! Really?
BANDIT 4
Settle down or it’s gonna hurt a lot more.
MAGNU:
(shouts after Guy)
A surgeon is always a good thing to have around, right Guy?
What if you get hurt in a daring duel with the King’s guard? Or you have to make a spectacular leap from a tower and break a leg?
GU:
Indeed. Now, tell me… things seem to have been rearranged since I was last here. Where do you keep the most dangerous poisons?
MAGNU:
Poisons? Well, I don’t know if you noticed the sign, but this is a House of Healing, and we don’t—grrk!
He gasps as Guy draws his sword and presses the blade to his throat.
GU:
Such lovely and smooth skin you surgeons have. It cries out to be split open. I am not going to ask you again.
MAGNU:
Okay! Okay! Look, everything’s in the new secure storage. The big metal door off the back hallway.
GU:
That wasn’t so hard, was it?
MAGNU:
Yeah, but I don’t know the password. And without that, it’s pretty much impenetrable.
GU:
Ha!
MAGNU:
Hey, I should know. I’ve tried everything.
GU:
They have yet to make a safe that can keep out Guy van Fleet, the purple thief of Kings, the hinderer of royalty, the people’s most feared champion.
MAGNU:
You can crack safes too?
GU:
Watch and learn, young Magnus.
MAGNU:
So awesome.
INT. MINISTRY OFFIC:
PEARCE:
Awesome?
MAGNU:
Yeah. I was buttering him up. Distracting him. He was so busy going on about how great he was that he forgot all about the letter opener. All part of my ingenious plan…
ALB:
Enough. Jerome?
JEROM:
(enraptured)
Yes, Alba?
ALB:
How did you get wrapped up in all this?
MAGNU:
You mean, how did he help me save the day!
ALB:
Speak again, Magnus. Go ahead. Just one more word.
Jerome?
JEROM:
Your eyes are so beautiful when you’re angry.
ALB:
(groans)
Yes, thank you, Jerome. Why were you at at the House of Healing?
JEROM:
To refill my prescription.
ALB:
The one I gave you yesterday?
JEROM:
Well… Yeah. I kinda drank it all in one go so I’d have an excuse to see you again. Because, you know, you’re just so smart and amazing and perfect and… did I say amazing?
ALB:
We definitely gave the potion to the wrong idiot.
PEARCE:
Jerome. Jerome.
(taps sharply on the desk)
Over here. Yes. Can you tell us what you saw when you came into the House of Healing?
JEROM:
Oh yeah. Magnus was there. But Alba wasn’t! I didn’t see her anywhere. She’s great, isn’t she?
PEARCE:
Focus, Jerome. What did you see?
JEROM:
Well, let’s see. I walked in and there he was, tied to his chair…
CROSSFADE TO:
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
The front door opens.
JEROM:
Hello! Alba?
MAGNU:
Shhh!
JEROM:
Huh? Who’s there?
MAGNU:
Jerome, be quiet! Get over here and help me.
JEROM:
Magnus? Why are you tied up?
MAGNU:
Because I wanted to try out a new magic trick.
JEROM:
Oh. Are you practicing escapes now? How’s it work?
MAGNU:
It doesn’t. Never mind! We’re being robbed!
JEROM:
Oh no! We are?
MAGNU:
Come on, get me out of these ropes. There’s a letter opener on the desk.
JEROM:
Okay. Who’s robbing us?
Jerome sets to work sawing at the ropes.
MAGNU:
Guy van Fleet! And his bandits!
JEROM:
(gasps)
They don’t have Alba, do they? We have to save her!
He stands up.
MAGNU:
No, no, stop! She’s not here. There’s like five brigands in there. Now hurry up and cut me loose!
JEROM:
Gotcha.
He saws at the ropes, which give way.
MAGNU:
That’s better. All right, let’s go!
JEROM:
Okay!
Jerome makes for the door.
MAGNU:
No, no—Jerome, where are you going?
JEROM:
To the gatehouse to alert the palace guards?
MAGNU:
No, if we go and get the guards, Guy and his guys are gonna get away!
Come on, no one is going to rob the House of Healing on my watch! That’s MY job!
JEROM:
So what do we do?
MAGNU:
I’ve been thinking this through. First priority, we need to jam the back door shut—and that job falls to you, my faithful sidekick.
JEROM:
Who, me?
MAGNU:
Now, they’re probably gonna have someone watching the back door, so… toss me that umbrella by the coatrack.
JEROM:
Okay…?
Jerome tosses the umbrella.
MAGNU:
In the meantime, I will provide a distraction. Go!
He throws open the door to the back hallway and brandishes the umbrella.
MAGNU:
Ha ha!
BANDIT 1
Whoa! The kid got loose.
The bandits draw their weapons.
GU:
Oho! Perhaps I underestimated you, little man.
MAGNU:
Oho! Perhaps you did!
A bandit runs in from the back.
BANDIT 2
What’s happening?
GU:
Nothing to worry about. You should be watching the back door!
BANDIT 2
Right. Sorry, boss.
MAGNU:
Hah!
Take this! and that!
GU:
With an umbrella?
MAGNU:
Spinning death blow!
The umbrella opens with a pop.
BANDIT 3
Get him!
The bandits draw their swords.
GU:
Impressive. No, my friends, stand back.
BANDIT 1
You don’t want us to thump him, boss?
GU:
No. I have him. I am going to enjoy this. Toss me your sword.
MAGNU:
Oh. You need two swords, do you?
GU:
It is not for me. I prefer not to strike down unarmed children. Catch!
He tosses the sword to Magnus.
MAGNU:
Your last mistake! Vortex Blade!
A whirlwind of blades. Guy defends with little effort.
GU:
I see you have not improved at all since our last encounter.
MAGNU:
Tiger Claw! HA!
GU:
There is no need for you to call your strikes, boy. Especially when your strikes are as pitiful as that!
BANDIT 2
Yeah!
MAGNU:
Hey! That was an awesome Tiger Claw!
GU:
Aha!
His blade zings out.
MAGNU:
(gasps)
Ah! A lucky strike! But you only just nicked me.
GU:
Death by a thousand cuts. A horrible way to go.
MAGNU:
Not today!
BANDIT 2
Boss, I think someone jammed the back door.
GU:
What? You imbecile!
Jerome looks in from reception.
JEROM:
Magnus! I jammed the back door. Now what?
MAGNU:
Fall back to the waiting room!
GU:
Oh no you don’t!
MAGNU:
Hell yeah we do!
Magnus slams the door. The bandits beat on it from the other side.
MAGNU:
Enjoy your stay!
(winces in pain)
JEROM:
That looks bad, Magnus!
MAGNU:
It feels worse! Oh gods.
BANDIT 1
Hey! Open this door!
They pound at the door.
MAGNU:
Quick! Grab that chair and push it under the door handle.
JEROM:
That door’s not gonna hold them, Magnus! We gotta get out of here!
MAGNU:
No, no, sit, Jerome. Sit in the chair. Good boy.
Now, where does Alba keep the matches?
JEROM:
Uh… are you sure about this?
Magnus rummages, tossing things out from drawers, as the pounding on the door grows.
MAGNU:
Aha! Now to start a fun little fire…
He strikes a match.
JEROM:
Hey! Isn’t that the appointment book? Alba’s not gonna be happy.
A growing crackle of flame.
MAGNU:
Man, my arm hurts! Dammit, all the bandages are in the other room, too.
JEROM:
So… now do we run?
MAGNU:
Nope. This is the good bit—see there’s a new fire suppression system in here.
JEROM:
A what?
MAGNU:
There’s half a dozen water sprites living in the attic. If they smell smoke from down here…
The sprites burst out singing a shrill alarm as waterfall sounds emerge from the back room.
MAGNU:
They do that.
Supposed to keep the patients and all of our flammable supplies safe or something.
A raging fire now. The sound of several bandits yelling and pounding on the other side of an interior door.
BANDIT:
Boss! What do we do? Help!
MAGNU:
It’s working. Ha ha, listen to them!
JEROM:
I dunno, Magnus…
MAGNU:
No, no! Jerome, do not get up! We have to keep the door shut!
The pounding grows weaker and stops as the water on the far side of the door rises.
JEROM:
We’re not… killing them, are we?
MAGNU:
It’s just a little water. They’re bandits! Brigands! They can swim!
BANDIT 1
(from inside)
Help! I can’t swim!
MAGNU:
Or I guess that’s pirates. Pirates can probably swim.
INT. MINISTRY OFFIC:
PEARCE:
So tell us, if there was a band of highwaymen trapped in the back room… where did they go?
JEROM:
I dunno! They were there, and then they were gone.
ALB:
Magnus?
MAGNU:
Well… I mean, yeah! Exactly!
We locked the doors. All the windows were still shut. And the water was all the way to the ceiling!
PEARCE:
Hmm. Perhaps we should take another look at the scene of the incident.
ALB:
I suppose we should.
PEARCE:
Jerome, you are free to go.
JEROM:
Thanks!
MAGNU:
And me? Am I free to go?
Alba, Pearcey and Jerome file out of the room.
JEROM:
Can I come along with you, Alba?
ALB:
No. Go home.
JEROM:
Awww.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING—CABINE:
A tiny, enclosed metal space.
BANDIT 3
Ow! Move your elbow!
BANDIT 2
Move your face!
The bandits struggle and grumble at one another.
GU:
All of you shush!
They all fall silent.
GU:
Okay. I think the coast is clear. On the count of three, everyone push. One. Two. Three.
Groans and shouts as they force the filing cabinet drawer open.
GU:
Okay. One a time. Stop pushing!
The bandits struggle to pull themselves from the filing cabinet.
BANDIT 1
That was a brilliant plan, boss! Hiding with all the files!
BANDIT 2
Yeah! Heh heh. I think I got a paper cut.
GU:
I am not so happy right now.
BANDIT:

This is not over. The little surgeon will pay dearly for this.

EL:
Howdy, shwmae, konnichiwa! It’s Eli here with Episode 4 of Alba Salix, Season Two.
I just wanted to take a moment to tell you that Sean and I will be in Seattle for PodCon 2 in January. It’s a weekend of live shows, panels and performances for people who love and/or make podcasts. We went to the first one last year, and let me tell you, it was an amazing time getting to meet the people who write and produce and act in our favourite shows. There’s a big audio drama and RPG presence there, and this time around we’re going to have a booth. Come and say hello, get some cool swag, meet fellow fans—it’s going to be an excellent time.
PodCon happens this January 19 and 20 in Seattle, Washington. We hope you can join us. For all the details check out podcon.com.
And now it is time for Alba Salix, Royal Physician Volume Two, Episode Four. Enjoy.

INT. PALACE CHAMBERS—NIGH:
Gunther shuffles past.
GUNTHE:
Oh! Parabel, you’re still up.
PARABEL
Mm hmm.
GUNTHE:
What are you reading, dear?
PARABEL
Oh… just a few books on pre-natal care.
GUNTHE:
Superfoods For Your Unborn Baby. My… Raising the Magical Child.
(chuckles)
Are we having “the magical child”?
PARABEL
Oh, they’re all magical, aren’t they?
I just want to give the baby a good head start in life.
GUNTHE:
I don’t think we can afford to bring in musicians to play for you around the clock again.
PARABEL
Oh no, nothing like that this time.
(mutters)
Not after little Willemina decided to smash her violin. On her violin teacher.
GUNTHE:
101 Spells For Mothers-To-Be. Isn’t it a bit risky to do magic while you’re expecting?
PARABEL
Oh, no, these are all minor charms. Completely harmless.
GUNTHE:
Ah, I see.
PARABEL
(mutters)
And completely useless.
GUNTHE:
Well, good night, dearest. Don’t stay up too late.
PARABEL
I won’t! Night, darling.
They make kissy-kissy sounds at one another.
As Gunther shuffles to the bedroom, Parabel tosses her book aside.
PARABEL
(sighs)
Useless.
To the Library it is.
OPENING THEM:
HERAL:
By Appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician—Volume Two! Episode the Fourth: Harvest Moon.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING OFFICE—DA:
PEARCE:
For the last time, Magnus, you may not play with knives at the reception desk.
MAGNU:
I wasn’t playing with it! I was showing it to our patients. They were totally interested!
ALB:
They were being polite to the person with the knife.
PEARCE:
I think the safety risk is quite evident.
MAGNU:
What about my safety? We got held up by bandits last week!
PEARCE:
What if you turn your back and a child takes it?
MAGNU:
(scoffs)
I know three easy ways to disarm an opponent with a knife.
(beat)
Two of them are non-lethal?
ALB:
No knives, Magnus.
Holly skips in, and begins handing out flowers.
HOLL:
Happy Harvest Moon, everyone!
PEARCE:
What are these?
HOLL:
Flower garlands! To wear to the Harvest Moon Faire tonight! You’re all going, right?
Silence.
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Aw, come on! There’s going to be drinking and dancing and music and pretty lanterns.
MAGNU:
So… can I have my knife back?
ALBA AND PEARCE:
No.
HOLL:
And costumes and cotton candy, and jugglers and plays…
PEARCE:
I’ll have to check my calendar.
ALB:
I’ve got another round of resumes to look through for the new hospital we’re setting up in Paradox.
HOLL:
Aww. You should give yourselves at least one night off! Balancing life and work is important. Right, Ms Pearcey?
PEARCE:
A night off is fine, of course. Whether or not you spend it at the Faire is up to you.
HOLL:
Alba’s going to go. Right, Alba?
ALB:
I thought you’d have some special fairy ritual to enact for the full moon.
HOLL:
That’s not happening this year. I’ve been kind of uninvited. But that means I can spend more time with all of you! What do you say?
ALB:
Oh… fine.
MAGNU:
Yeah, I guess.
HOLL:
Ms Pearcey? C’mon, it’s a perfect chance for us to bond as a team!
PEARCE:
Yes… bonding as a… team.
HOLL:
Yay! This is going to be the best Harvest Moon ever!
MUSIC STIN:
INT. PALACE LIBRAR:
The sound of a heavy page turning.
JULI:
Ooo, jackpot.
AMAND:
So, Julia. When you have a moment…
JULI:
(still writing)
Uh huh?
AMAND:
Perhaps all these lovely, priceless tomes could find a better place to live than the checkout desk?
JULI:
In a minute. Hey Amanda. I found a chapter in Sarvik’s Historias about Balgomarian Yeti. Check this out.
Julia turns a page.
AMAND:
They’re green?
JULI:
And only three feet high.
AMAND:
Aww!
JULI:
It sounds like they’re a matriarchal society.
AMAND:
Small green ladies in charge. I’m a fan.
JULI:
The best part: The Yetani, as they call themselves, are famous for their gin, made from a rare juniper bush which only grows in the ice caves of the Frozen Sea.
AMAND:
I already want some.
JULI:
And they mix it with ice wine, birch syrup and vodka to make something called a Green Flame.
AMAND:
Wait, Green Flame—does that mean you light it on fire?
JULI:
You totally light it on fire.
AMAND:
Yes! Do you think the palace kitchens have Yetani gin?
JULI:
Not any more!
I may have already stopped by the kitchens on my way into work.
Julia pulls out a big bottle and sets it on the desk, followed by a pair of cocktail glasses.
AMAND:
Yes! I want mine with extra flame!
Julia sets to work as Parabel enters.
PARABEL
You there. Librarians.
AMAND:
Oh! Your Majesty. Hi!
JULI:
Royal Librarians at your service.
She shakes a cocktail shaker.
PARABEL
Are you drinking? On the job?!
AMAND:
Uh. Nope! Not yet.
JULI:
We are compiling the first comprehensive ethnographic study of the drinking cultures of Farloria and the neighbouring—
PARABEL
I don’t know why I asked.
I sent a page down yesterday to retrieve a book.
Amanda starts digging through papers.
AMAND:
Yes, sorry, your Majesty. So you were after… The Six Books De Rerum Spiritus of Sundvik, Tome 2?
PARABEL
That is the one.
JULI:
I think that one’s in our Rare Documents collection.
She begins hunting through drawers of index cards.
AMAND:
So. Can I get your Majesty a drink? Of water, I mean? Or coffee?
PARABEL
I am fine.
AMAND:
Cool. Cool cool.
JULI:
Okay, I show three copies. One’s at our sister branch in Fair-Upon-Middling. The second one… Does your Majesty read Vayaxan?
PARABEL
Excuse me?
JULI:
It’s the original edition, written in demonic script.
PARABEL
Hmph. And the third copy?
JULI:
Yeah, the third one’s a more recent translation. But it’s out on loan since… oh, wow.
AMAND:
Who loaned out a book from Rare Documents?
JULI:
It says it was checked out by Mr. Krankel.
PARABEL
Doctor Krankel.
JULI:
That’s the one.
PARABEL
He’s been banished from the kingdom.
AMAND:
Someone’s going to be owing a lot of late fees!
PARABEL
(clears her throat)
I require a copy of this book.
JULI:
Uh… Demonic script?
PARABEL
That I can read.
Jula returns to the counter.
JULI:
I’ll put in a request, but it’s going to be about a week and a half.
AMAND:
What about secondary sources, Julia?
PARABEL
Secondary sources?
Amanda and Julia begin leafing through other big books.
JULI:
Yeah, there may be some useful references to it in other books. Try Benneghi’s Compendium?
AMAND:
Yup, on it.
JULI:
I didn’t realize you were so interested in ancient magic, Your Majesty!
PARABEL
Just… curious.
AMAND:
Okay, I think I found a reference. It’s by Fractazius?
JULI:
Oh, right! Good old Fractazius the Dark.
Julia vanishes into the stacks to search.
AMAND:
See, Fractazius apparently wrote a play based on The Books De Rerum Spiritus.
PARABEL
A play? What use is that?
JULI:
The Ambassador of Doom. It’s said to actually contain key passages from the Books.
PARABEL
I see…
AMAND:
Ooo, it looks like it was even banned once, back in King Lothar’s time.
Julia returns, flipping through a small book.
JULI:
I’m guessing that was after the disaster at the Grandville Opry.
AMAND:
Oh, when it burned down?
JULI:
Well, supposedly the fire was just a cover-up for what really happened.
AMAND:
Uh-oh!
JULI:
On opening night, the lead actress suddenly transformed into a demonic beast of unparalleled power that killed dozens before being subdued by the town guard!
AMAND:
Whoa.
PARABEL
Unparalleled power, you say?
JULI:
She leapt into the front row and devoured the patrons’ faces.
AMAND:
Nooo!
PARABEL
I will have this play.
AMAND:
See, this is why no one likes audience participation.
JULI:
I know, right? Hmm. There’s no publishing date, but I think this might be the first printing?
PARABEL
Yes. I will have it now, please.
JULI:
Oh. Sure. Was there anything else, your Majesty…?
Parabel is already striding out in a huff.
PARABEL
Unbelievable.
AMAND:
Cranky.
JULI:
I wonder why she wanted that book, anyway?
AMAND:
Eh, royalty. Who knows why they do anything?
JULI:
So, drinks?
AMAND:
Hell yes!
Julia pours out the drinks and strikes a match. There’s a little whoomph of flame.
JULI:
Ohh, even the flames are green.
AMAND:
Nice!
They clink glasses.
AMANDA AND JULI:
Cheers!

Someone’s all gwumpy pants.
PEARCE:
I am not grumpy.
LORI:
No, you’re gwumpy pants. That’s worse.
PEARCE:
We could just stay in… Have a nice dinner and a relaxing bath?
LORI:
We can do that any old night. It’s our anniversary!
PEARCE:
Which anniversary?
LORI:
Of the night we first met!
PEARCE:
We met at an office party the night of the Harvest Moon Faire.
LORI:
Exactly!
PEARCE:
The Harvest Moon is on a different date every year.
LORI:
It’s not the date. It’s the occasion, silly. Let’s go dance and watch fireworks and eat fried pumpkin on a stick. C’mon, gwumpy pants.
PEARCE:
I am not gwumpy pants.
LORI:
Can you say that again with a little bit more of a pout?
PEARCE:
I just… What if one of those miserable wizards from the OSG sees us together?
LORI:
Tally. Who cares what they think?
PEARCE:
We’re fighting to get them to abide by proper workplace guidelines… and here I am, seeing you.
LORI:
And?
PEARCE:
I’m your superior.
LORI:
(snickers)
Debatable.
PEARCE:
Rude. You know what I mean. I don’t want to set a bad example.
LORI:
You do realize this is the one night of the year you don’t have to worry about being recognized.
PEARCE:
What do you mean?
Loria opens her purse.
LORI:
There’s this little thing called a masquerade.
PEARCE:
That’s true. But where are we going to get…
She comes to a halt as Loria holds up a pair of masks.
LORI:
(proudly)
Ah?
PEARCE:
…masks. Why do you have all these masquerade masks?
LORI:
“Thank you, Loria! They’re so beautiful! You’re a genius.”
PEARCE:
They are… quite pretty.
LORI:
Yeah, they are. Here, I picked this one for you.
Pearcey tries it on.
PEARCE:
I’ve never worn one of these before.
LORI:
Oh, that looks super adorable! Yes, a thousand times yes.
PEARCE:
All right. What about you?
LORI:
Well… I like this lacey blue one but there’s also this silvery one with the little ears… What do you think?
PEARCE:
(entranced)
That one.
LORI:
The blue?
PEARCE:
I think you should definitely wear that one.
LORI:
Done.
(beat)
What?
PEARCE:
(coy)
Do we really have to go out tonight?
LORI:
Come on, you, let’s get dressed.
MUSIC STIN:
EXT. FAIRGROUND STALL, EARLY EVENIN:
A bustling crowd in high spirits. Drummers perform nearby.
WITHRO:
Duviar nectar! Fresh-squeezed duviar nectar!
FAIRE-GOE:
(quite drunk)
Say, I’ll have one of those!
Withrow pours a cupful of juice from a keg.
WITHRO:
You betcha. That’ll be sixpence.
FAIRE-GOE:
Okay. Whoa, that’s a lot.
WITHRO:
Fresh duviar fruit’s hard to come by in these parts, but it’s the most healthful drink you’ll drink all night, my friend.
FAIRE-GOE:
(chuckles)
Well, you’re not wrong about that.
Coins jingle.
WITHRO:
Have a great Faire!
(to the next customer)
Good evening, friend. Can I get you a nice cup of duviar nectar?
MAGNU:
(disguising his voice)
What’s in it?
Withrow starts pouring another cup.
WITHRO:
Only one hundred percent fresh-squeezed duviar fruit, direct from the Pointy Lands. An excellent source of duviatic acid, which has been shown to aid in pancreatic function. And a happy pancreas makes for a happy stomach. That’ll be sixpence, my friend.
Magnus pulls back his hood.
MAGNU:
(back to his normal voice)
Oh no. You’re busted, sucker!
WITHRO:
Busted—what? Why?
MAGNU:
House of Healing Hygiene Enforcement Squad! Withrow Lee, you are charged with selling drinks without a license.
WITHRO:
Uh, it’s right here. Say, aren’t you that kid that works for Alba? Mathias…
MAGNU:
Magnus. And I’m eighteen, by the way, and certified by the Ministry of Magical Affairs and Health, by the way.
WITHRO:
Certified to do what?
MAGNU:
Certified to take you downtown, buddy.
All right, fine, your so-called license looks legit. But what about this health drink of yours?
WITHRO:
Duviatic acid’s a real thing. Ask Alba! There’s even evidence it may boost the immune system, but I don’t tell my customers that because there’s only been the one study so far.
MAGNU:
Well, aren’t you a paragon of scientific rigour.
WITHRO:
Darn tootin’. If I lie, Alba will wire my mouth shut.
MAGNU:
Hmph. Do you reuse these cups?
WITHRO:
Sterilized after every use with a Purissimus spell.
MAGNU:
Dangit.
Fine. But how do we know this fruit isn’t contaminated with deadly… fig fungus?
WITHRO:
(dubious)
Fig fungus?
MAGNU:
It’s spreading all over the Pointy Lands. One little spore can paralyze you from head to toe.
WITHRO:
Look, can I get on with selling my wares now?
MAGNU:
Go ahead. But I’ll be watching you, buddy.
WITHRO:
Knock yourself out.
(raises his voice again)
Duviar nectar! Sixpence a glass!

EXT. MARKET SQUARE STAG:
A boisterous crowd watches a player on a stage.
PLAYE:
And these two souls once so in love
Do murder one another for the sake
Of money, greed and power, you shall see
Next Friday ‘pon this stage, at half past eight!
A smattering of applause. Holly flutters through the crowd.
HOLL:
Alba!
ALB:
Down here.
FAIRE-GOE:
Hey, watch the wings!
HOLL:
Sorry!
(to Alba)
Did I miss the previews?
ALB:
Yes, he just finished. Why do they always have to give away the entire story?
PLAYE:
And now, my friends, be much afeared! Our main event at last is here:
The Tragic History of Baron Bolgu… brought to you by the Guild of Knife Sharpeners.
Applause. Two more actors take the stage: the gruff Cook and the young Master Martin.
COO:
Ho there, good Master Martin!
MARTI:
Ho there, cook! Have you the evening repast prepared?
COO:
‘Tis under way, ’tis under way.
MARTI:
You must work fast! The repast is well past time.
COO:
I blame these blasted blades.
MARTI:
Ay, these are in a truly ‘trocious state, good cook. No good to chop a chop, these.
COO:
Such a dull tool could scarce split the wind from an old nun’s backside. Speaking of dull tools, how fares our lord the Count?
Laughter. The play continues under Alba and Holly’s dialogue.
ALB:
Looks like there’s going to be a murder.
HOLL:
Oh no! How can you tell?
ALB:
They’re doing an ad for the Knife-Sharpeners’ Guild. They always sponsor the true crime ones.
HOLL:
Oh, you’re right! I’d never noticed that.
ALB:
At least it’s better than the love stories, where they’re all ads for mattresses.
HOLL:
I don’t know if I want to see a murdery play.
MARTI:
The Count is in a rare mood.
COO:
How rare? Bloody?
MARTI:
A bloody rare mood indeed! He rants on his hunger and he rails on his thirst.
JEROM:
Oh! Hey! Alba, is that you?
ALB:
Dammit.
HOLL:
Hello, Jerome!
JEROM:
Holly! Nice to see you too. Mind if I sit here?
ALB:
(under her breath)
Well, so much for enjoying the show.
COO:
The Count did dine but an hour ago. Let him rant and rail and perhaps he shall shout himself hoarse.
MARTI:
Or myself deaf.
COO:
And bring you peace, either way.
MARTI:
I sooner would keep my ears. The Count must have food!
COO:
Then quick, hie you to the sharpener’s shop, and he’ll shortly shave and shape these shivs sharp as shark’s teeth.
MARTI:
I surely shall!
COO:
Mind you, good Master Martin, forget not your purse, lest you return transfixed with our best blade ‘twixt your ribs, for ’tis never sharp to short the sharpener.
Laughter and applause. In the background, another actor takes the stage: the Baron, giving his opening soliloquy.
JEROM:
Did I miss anything?
HOLL:
Alba says there’s going to be a murder.
JEROM:
Really? How can you tell?
ALB:
Oh, I just have this feeling.
JEROM:
That reminds me. I’ve been having a feeling too, kind of an itching. I tried that salve you ladies gave me the other week, but it’s been getting worse all day.
ALB:
How about we watch the first act?
JEROM:
Okay, I can wait!
HOLL:
(whispers)
Alba…!
ALB:
(whispers)
What?
HOLL:
It’s going to be dark soon. Don’t you think we should, you know, get Jerome to somewhere safer?
ALB:
We just got here.
HOLL:
The moon’s going to rise, and then… you know.
ALB:
I know.
HOLL:
Maybe we should tell him that he’s a—
ALB:
He does not need another excuse to pester me for more cures. Besides, he’s perfectly nice when he’s… affected.
HOLL:
You mean when he’s a werewolf.
ALB:
Not so loud! Just the first act, that’s all I ask. We can go at intermission.
HOLL:
But—
ALB:
Intermission. Now hush.
BARO:
Ho, who’s there? My ears yet ring.
Methought I heard a voice from in the hearth.
DEMO:
(hisses)
Hail and well met!
BARO:
What! Who art thou, fiend?
JEROM:
Oh, look! Isn’t that the guy who played Count Bozannio last spring?
HOLL:
I missed that show. Ooo, I love his outfit!
ALB:
Can you both be quiet for one single minute?
MUSIC STIN:
EXT. FAIRGROUNDS—DUS:
Loria and Pearcey approach a lively crowd of revelers dancing to a band of musicians.
LORI:
What about the Gryphon and Bucket?
PEARCE:
That wasn’t our first date. You tricked me.
LORI:
It still counts.
PEARCE:
You said it was a departmental planning session.
LORI:
It worked. I seem to remember it worked about five more times after that?
PEARCE:
(laughs)
Maybe.
But no. Our first official, mutually-agreed-upon date was May 12.
LORI:
Remind me?
PEARCE:
7pm. Closer to 7:15.
LORI:
I believe you. What happened?
PEARCE:
Dinner. Dancing. Ice cream.
LORI:
(mischievous)
Ohh, the ice cream, yes…
Wow. So that’s your idea of a first date?
PEARCE:
Well…!
LORI:
Damn, you’re pretty forward, aren’t you?
PEARCE:
Minx.
LORI:
Hussy.
They laugh. Holly flutters past overhead.
HOLL:
Oh, hi! Loria, is that you?
LORI:
Yes?
PEARCE:
(under her breath)
Oh, no.
HOLL:
Hi! It’s me! Holly? From the House of Healing?
LORI:
Of course! How are you?
HOLL:
I’m good! Gosh, what a pretty mask! I almost didn’t recognize you. Who’s your friend?
PEARCE:
(disguising her voice)
Uh… I’m Tally.
HOLL:
Hi Tally! You both look super cute.
PEARCE:
Thanks.
LORI:
So. You having a good Faire?
HOLL:
It’s so neat! All the candy and ribbons… Oh, but I almost forgot. Have you seen a dog running around?
LORI:
What kind of dog?
HOLL:
About this big, kind of unusual-looking? He’s got a short muzzle, strangely wide at the shoulders… His name’s Toby.
LORI:
I haven’t seen anything bigger than a beagle.
PEARCE:
Yeah, me neither.
LORI:
Sorry, Holly. We’ll keep an eye out!
HOLL:
Thanks! Nice seeing you!
She takes off again.
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Toby! C’mere buddy! Toby!
PEARCE:
That was a close one. Do you think she suspected?
LORI:
Oh, for heaven’s sake.
PEARCE:
I’m serious.
LORI:
Are you going to let that ruin your night? You are, aren’t you.
PEARCE:
I knew this was a bad idea.
LORI:
Look. If it’s going to be like this every time we go out together… I think you’d better let me go.
PEARCE:
Let you…?
LORI:
You’ve basically replaced me with that talking rock.
PEARCE:
Leon isn’t a replacement. A rock can’t do filing or run errands.
LORI:
Well, I’m glad I can provide such valuable assistance.
PEARCE:
That’s not what I mean.
LORI:
This secret office romance bit has been exciting and everything, but I think we’d better call it off.
PEARCE:
(devastated)
Loria…
A moment.
LORI:
(realizes)
The office part, you goof, not the romance.
PEARCE:
Oh, thank the gods.
LORI:
I bet I can get a transfer to the Planning Office. I’d be two floors up. Keep an eye on His Majesty’s latest crazy ideas.
Tally, I’m not leaving you.
PEARCE:
Just your job?
LORI:
Just my job. Why do you think I took it in the first place?
PEARCE:
What, to be near me?
(laughs)
LORI:
What can I say? I’m very goal-driven in my career.
Come here.
They kiss.
PEARCE:
So if we’re not working together, what are we going to do for excitement?
LORI:
Mmm. We’ll have to think of something.
PEARCE:
Well… come dance with me. Let’s see if it sparks any ideas.
EXT. FAIRGROUND STALL
It’s quieter here, though the crowd is still lively. Crickets can be heard further off.
Withrow counts out some coins for a customer.
WITHRO:
And that’s seven, eight, nine is one shilling, plus five more is your change.
CUSTOME:
Thank you!
WITHRO:
You have yourself a great evening, my friend.
MAGNU:
You keep giving them the right change.
WITHRO:
I keep telling you, there is no scam.
MAGNU:
Yeah, right.
WITHRO:
Duviar nectar! Fresh from the Pointy Lands!
MAGNU:
The way Alba tells it, you’re always up to something.
WITHRO:
Get your fresh squeezed duviar nectar!
In the distance, there’s an unearthly howl, and screams of panic.
MAGNU:
So, like… What was your favourite?
WITHRO:
Favourite what?
MAGNU:
Your favourite hustle. Your favourite scheme.
WITHRO:
(whispers)
Will you stop it? I’m not hustling anyone!
MAGNU:
You can tell me. I used to be an outlaw myself. C’mon. Even just a straight-up con with no magic.
WITHRO:
Hey there, Miss! Would you care for a refreshing cup of…
(no luck—he sighs)
Kid, you’re scaring away my customers.
MAGNU:
Tell me about one con and I’ll leave you alone.
WITHRO:
I don’t want to talk about this.
MAGNU:
(loudly)
What’s that? Duviar fruit can carry deadly fig fungus?
Gasps from the crowd.
WITHRO:
(whispers)
Kid, for Kroth’s sake.
MAGNU:
I hear one bite of a contaminated fruit will stop your heart!
Howling and barking and screams of panic, growing louder and closer.
WITHRO:
All right. All right.
Okay. When Alba and I were at Hazelbrooke, we used to go to this cafe near the campus called the Crotchety Crow. And every day—
Alba rushes up.
ALB:
(winded)
Magnus! There you are.
MAGNU:
No I’m not!
ALB:
What?
MAGNU:
I was just helping Withrow! Is that so wrong?
WITHRO:
Hi Alba.
ALB:
Withrow.
WITHRO:
It’s so good to see you.
ALB:
Yup. Magnus, I need your help. Toby’s on the loose.
MAGNU:
Whoa, really? As in Jerome Toby?
ALB:
Yes. We have to find him. Holly’s trying to spot him from the air.
WITHRO:
Who’s Toby?
ALB:
He’s a… stray dog.
WITHRO:
You mean a werewolf?
ALB:
What gave you that idea?
WITHRO:
Oh, full moon, howling and screaming in the distance…
MAGNU:
Oh yeah, look, there’s a full moon tonight. What are the odds?
ALB:
Why do you think they’re having a festival?
Holly zooms past.
HOLL:
(shouting from the air)
I see him! Alba, he’s coming this way! I think he’s following your scent.
ALB:
Oh, let’s hope so.
The screams get closer. Then Jerome appears, panting and woofing happily.
JEROM:
Woof woof rarf woof!
ALB:
Toby! Come here, boy.
Jerome launches himself at her and knocks her to the ground.
ALBA (CONT’D)
Oof! Okay, that’s enough. No kisses.
HOLL:
Yay!
MAGNU:
Does anybody have a collar?
HOLL:
We should be fine. He’ll follow Alba just about anywhere as long as he doesn’t get distracted.
ALB:
All right, Toby. Off. Cut it out.
She pushes him off.
WITHRO:
Alba? Do you want a hand?
ALB:
I’m fine.
WITHRO:
Come on, let me help you up.
Jerome abruptly stops panting. Deadly silence. He lets out a deep, throaty growl.
ALB:
(quietly)
Withrow, stop. Back away, please. He can be a bit jealous—
WITHRO:
He’s wagging his tail!
What’s up, buddy? Why don’t you move over and let Alba…
Jerome lunges, snarling like a demon.
WITHRO:
Aagh! Whoa! Buddy! Nice werewolf!
HOLL:
Toby!
Withrow scrambles back, then runs off, screaming and pursued by a werewolf. Alba and Holly give chase, their voices all fading into the crowd.
ALB:
Withrow! I told you to back away!
WITHRO:
Help!
HOLL:
Toby, it’s all right!
MAGNU:
So I’ll just look after the stall, okay? Okay!
Duviar nectar! Three pennies a glass!
EXT. FAIRGROUND MUSIC STAG:
The band finishes their song, and Pearcey and Loria emerge from the dancing crowd, laughing.
PEARCE:
I think I need a drink after that!
LORI:
Glad you came to the Faire?
PEARCE:
Yes, yes.
The dancing fairgoers suddenly erupt in panic as Jerome chases Withrow through their midst. Shouts of “Look out!” and “Mad dog!”
JEROM:
(barking viciously)
WITHRO:
(screaming)
Help! Somebody!
PEARCE:
Loria, look out!
LORI:
Whoa!
WITHRO:
Aaaaa!
Withrow and Jerome barrel past. People scatter. The band stumbles to a halt.
PEARCE:
Are you all right?
LORI:
Yeah. Looks like they found their lost dog.
The crowd is in chaos. Holly shouts from overhead.
HOLL:
It’s okay! He won’t hurt you. Toby, over here!
WITHRO:
Look out, everybody! It’s a werewolf!
Gasps from the crowd.
HOLL:
Oh, thanks, Withrow, that was really helpful!
LORI:
That was a werewolf?
PEARCE:
(sighs)
I’m going to have to write this up.
LORI:
Wow.
Cut to the midst of the crowd.
JEROM:
(growls)
HOLL:
Everybody stay back! Withrow, you can move away slowly.
Withrow?
SMALL CHIL:
Puppy!
BUDDY (A FAIRE-GOER)
Someone needs to deal with that dog!
HOLL:
We are dealing with him!
BIFF (ANOTHER FAIRE-GOER)
It’s not a dog, it’s a werewolf. I got this.
Biff steps out of the crowd and draws a sword. Cheers.
BUDD:
Yeah, you get him, Biff!
HOLL:
Albaaa! Where are you?!
The crowd begins to close in, some pulling out makeshift weapons. Shouts of “Fight! Fight!”
JEROM:
(growls louder)
BIF:
Everybody, keep steady. We got him cornered.
I’m gonna put this dog down.
He takes a fancy swing with his sword. Loria steps in front of him.
LORI:
Uh-uh. No you don’t!
HOLL:
What she said!
BIF:
Get out of the way.
PEARCE:
Stop! Weapons down, all of you.
BIF:
Move it, ladies. I don’t want to have to hurt you.
LORI:
You back off, buddy!
PEARCE:
Are you threatening a Minister of the Crown, sir?
BIF:
(laughs)
What, you?
Pearcey takes off her mask.
PEARCE:
Yes. Antalia Pearcey, Minister of Magical Affairs and Health.
BIF:
Oooo!
HOLL:
Oh my gosh! Hi, Ms Pearcey!
PEARCE:
Yes, hello Holly.
BIF:
Well, la di da.
PEARCE:
Sir, put your sword away.
BIF:
If you’re Minister of Magical whatever, why aren’t you dealing with this animal?
PEARCE:
The situation is under control.
(whispers to Holly)
It is under control, isn’t it?
HOLL:
(whispers)
Totally! Alba’s on her way.
PEARCE:
She’d better be.
(aloud)
One of our specialists will be here at any moment.
BUDD:
That monster could hurt people!
HOLL:
He is people! He’s a person, like you and me. Even if he does steal the occasional sandwich and pee on things he shouldn’t. He’s never hurt anyone!
BIF:
Clear off, fairy.
He shoves her aside.
HOLL:
Ow! Hey!
BIF:
C’mon, little wolfy.
PEARCE:
Sir, I won’t ask you again. Put the sword away.
BIF:
This thing could kill everybody. It’s a monster.
HOLL:
He’s not a monster.
Holly’s wings start to buzz angrily. Wind howls. The crowd starts to back away.
BIF:
Says you.
(then)
What the hell are you?
HOLL:
I’m the Queen of the Wind, buster!
BIF:
(shaken)
Well, why don’t you blow awaaaay—aaaaaa!
Biff’s voice is distorted as he’s sucked into a whirlwind. His sword goes flying as the wind carries him off.
HOLL:
(straining)
There. Anybody else?
BUDD:
Nope, I think I’m good.
The crowd mutters uncertainly. The wind dies down and Holly’s wings buzz to a stop.
Alba runs up.
ALB:
Get out of the way.
Toby!
PEARCE:
Ms Salix. Thank heavens.
JEROM:
(pants happily)
ALB:
Good boy. Come here. Is everything all right?
Holly?
HOLL:
(giddy from exhaustion)
Hi Alba! I, um… there was a guy with a sword and I… kind of stopped him.
She falls over.
ALB:
Holly?
JEROM:
Woof!
PEARCE:
As you were. Thank you, everyone. Please, go back to enjoying the Faire.
LORI:
The Minister commands you to go have fun.
The crowd reluctantly disperses. The band gets back to playing.
PEARCE:
Ms Salix? Did you know about this individual’s condition? Is he a patient of yours?
ALB:
What’s that, Toby? Time for a walk?
JEROM:
(excited)
Whuff!
PEARCE:
Ms Salix!
ALB:
Sorry, it’s so loud here! Let’s talk some other time! Come on, Holly.
HOLL:
(still giddy)
I’m okay!
Alba, Holly and Jerome rush off.
LORI:
Well? How’s that for excitement?
PEARCE:
His Majesty owes me a raise.
LORI:
Mmm hmm. Dinner?
PEARCE:
Yes, please.
MUSIC STIN:
EXT. HILLTOP, AFTER MIDNIGH:
Crickets. The party can be heard faintly in the distance. Withrow speaks in hushed whispers with a woman.
PARABEL
There you are.
WITHRO:
Sorry I’m late. There was a… situation.
PARABEL
The moon is almost at its zenith. Did you bring the device?
WITHRO:
Um… as I said, there was a tiny bit of an incident and… somebody stole it.
PARABEL
What?!
WITHRO:
I got chased around. There was a whole thing, with a werewolf…
PARABEL
Why weren’t you keeping out of sight tonight?
WITHRO:
Hey, a guy’s gotta make a living somehow.
PARABEL
Did you see who took it?
WITHRO:
No. I must have dropped it when I was being chased.
PARABEL
You fool. I should have known better than to hire you.
WITHRO:
Well, you wanted to summon a demon.
PARABEL
Can the ritual be done without the device?
WITHRO:
It’s dangerous. I wouldn’t want to try—
MAGNU:
Why… hello.
PARABEL
(gasps)
WITHRO:
(startled)
Magnus! What the…
MAGNU:
Hey, Withrow. How’s it going?
WITHRO:
What are you doing here?
A rustle of grass as Magnus steps forward.
MAGNU:
Just getting some fresh air. Anyway, Withrow, dude, while you were running for your life, I noticed you dropped a little something on the ground.
WITHRO:
Do you have it?
MAGNU:
Say, who’s your scary friend?
PARABEL
(disguising her voice)
None of your business, boy.
MAGNU:
Fair enough. Nice cloak.
Anyway, so here’s this little doodad…
He pulls it out of his pocket.
WITHRO:
Thanks, kid. You’re saving my—
MAGNU:
Uh-uh-uh. Not so fast.
PARABEL
Be careful with that!
MAGNU:
Now, my best guess is, this is some kind of deflector? Like, for detecting and dispelling magical barriers? As you would if, you know, you were summoning a demon from another plane?
PARABEL
Just hand it over.
MAGNU:
I’ve been reading up, man. I know things.
PARABEL
If you two are quite finished…
MAGNU:
Do I know you from somewhere?
PARABEL
No.
She takes a step back. Magnus follows.
MAGNU:
I totally do.
PARABEL
Stay away from me.
WITHRO:
C’mon, never mind her. Give me the—
MAGNU:
Ha!
Magnus lunges forward and knocks Parabel’s hood back.
WITHRO:
Magnus—
MAGNU:
(in disbelief)
Whoaaaa! It’s—you’re—
PARABEL
Yes. I am.
MAGNU:
You’re the Queen. You’re the actual mothergoosing Queen! What the heck is going on?
PARABEL
You will address me properly.
MAGNU:
Right. Right. Your Majesty, whatever. Sorry. What are you two up to?
PARABEL
Right now, we are about to deal with a stupid boy who has found out too much.
Mister Lee. Kill him.
MAGNU:
Ho ho! I’d like to see you try. Ha! Hoo!
He strikes a pose, then carries out a flurry of unarmed moves.
WITHRO:
Look, kid. I don’t want to do this. I really, really don’t want to do this, but…
MAGNU:
Yeah?
WITHRO:
Obliviscere!
A violent surge of magic.
MAGNU:
Aw, dude, that spell was sweet! Alba never… shows me anything… cool…
(gasps)
He falls to the ground.

INT. HOUSE OF HEALING RECEPTIO:
Jerome wanders in from the back, barefoot.
JEROM:
Ugh. Where am I?
ALB:
Good morning, Jerome.
JEROM:
Oh! Morning, Alba! Hi Holly.
HOLL:
You should get some rest, Jerome. You had a busy night last night.
JEROM:
I did? What was last night?
HOLL:
The Harvest Moon Faire?
JEROM:
It was? How come I don’t remember it? Darn it, I was looking forward to it. I always seem to miss it for some reason…
ALB:
Jerome, we have some important news to tell you.
JEROM:
Okay?
HOLL:
The first thing is, you should read this brochure I made!
JEROM:
“Were It’s At”. Is that spelled right?
HOLL:
Read it! Read it!
JEROM:
“Were It’s At. A guide for new and newly-discovered—”
(gasps)
Is this for real? I’m a…?
ALB:
I’m afraid so.
JEROM:
This explains so much…
The front door opens and Magnus wanders in.
MAGNU:
Hey guys.
HOLL:
Hey Magnus! Did you have fun at the Faire last night?
MAGNU:
The Faire? Like, the Harvest Moon Faire?
HOLL:
Yes!
MAGNU:
…was last night?
HOLL:
Yes!
MAGNU:
You sure?
HOLL:
Pretty sure! Jerome turned into a werewolf and everything.
MAGNU:
Aw man. That would have been cool to see.
How come I don’t remember any of it?
JEROM:
I don’t remember anything either. Magnus! Are you a werewolf?
MAGNU:
Am I…?
Maybe!
JEROM:
Here, read this list of symptoms.
ALB:
Magnus is not a werewolf.
MAGNU:
Yeah? You don’t know.
ALB:
Catch.
She tosses him a small bottle, which he catches.
MAGNU:
What’s this?
ALB:
A bottle made of silver.
JEROM:
(growls)
ALB:
You’re not a werewolf, Magnus.
MAGNU:
Aww! But… last night—
ALB:
It was the Harvest Moon. Half the town can’t remember what they did last night.
MAGNU:
Well, I’m sure I did something awesome. Dangit. That would be so cool. Hey, Jerome, do you think you could…?
JEROM:
Huh?
MAGNU:
You know, just a little bite. Here. Right on the arm.
JEROM:
You want me to bite you?
ALB:
No. Jerome, no biting. Magnus, get to work.
MAGNU:
You never let me have any fun.

"Alba Salix 205: A Blueprint For Success","INTRODUCTIO:
EL:
Greetings! Kamusta! Góðan daginn! It’s Eli here, your writer and co-producer, bringing you Episode 5 of Alba Salix, Royal Physician, Volume 2.
Somehow we are already up to Episode 5, because time flies when you’re making podcasts, apparently. We’re coming up on our crazypants season finale next week. But don’t worry—there are more stories to come, believe you me.
First off, The End of Time and Other Bothers! If you haven’t heard it yet, that’s our improvised role-playing game spinoff, set mostly in the same world as Alba, full of fairy cakes and demons and utter lunacy. We’ve got a holiday special on the way, and a new season starting in January. Look for “Other Bothers” in your favourite podcast app.
Next up, it’s another season of The Axe & Crown. Gubbin, Stan and Betula will be back in the studio in the new year. We’ll have more about that soon on this podcast feed too… and in the meantime, if you support us on Patreon, you might catch a little scene featuring our favourite trolls, coming soon. And we’ve already begun planning Season 3 of Alba, of course, and it’s going to be a wild ride too.
So, tons of stories coming at you! If you want to help us get them made, and you’re able to, do consider joining us on Patreon. You’ll get regular updates, plus a ton of bonus content and other goodies, and you’ll get to hear all those new episodes first. Look for the Patreon link at albasalix.com.
That’s all for now. On with Episode 5!
MUSIC STIN:
INT. PALACE THRONE ROO:
A big wooden door opens and Gunther enters.
GUNTHE:
(excited)
Hello, Minister. Hello, Alba.
PEARCE:
Your Majesty.
ALB:
Your Majesty.
GUNTHE:
I’ve just been reviewing your proposal for this new School of Medicine.
PEARCE:
You read it?
I mean, thank you for reading it, Your Majesty.
GUNTHE:
And I agree. We need to begin training a new generation of healers to keep this kingdom fit and well. A state-of-the-art facility for research and education. And I believe we should begin as soon as possible.
ALB:
That is good news.
PEARCE:
I can have my staff draw up a list of requirements for the building design…
GUNTHE:
No need.
PEARCE:
Your Majesty?
GUNTHE:
I’ve designed it already!
ALB:
(to herself)
I’m not going to say anything. I’m not going to say anything.
GUNTHE:
It’s over here.
Behold!
Gunther strides over to a corner and whisks away a sheet.
ALB:
(sighs)
PEARCE:
It’s… very nice.
GUNTHE:
Isn’t it? I’ve been using a brand-new tool—a gift from the Gnomish ambassador. It’s a kit with all these parts you can snap together to create “visualizations” of buildings, or whole streets… Look, there’s even little trees.
ALB:
Yes, the trees…
PEARCE:
…are lovely, Your Majesty.
GUNTHE:
And now, we can simply pop down a piece of paper, and the quill magically draws up all the blueprints and the budget for us.
He does so. The quill begins sketching and writing at high speed.
PEARCE:
Why is it such a strange shape?
GUNTHE:
It’s a unicorn! Known for their legendary powers of healing.
ALB:
Give me strength.
PEARCE:
Oh, it’s lying down. I was confused. So this tower here…
GUNTHE:
Yes, that’s the head! I thought perhaps the horn could even light up magically.
ALB:
Ahh.
PEARCE:
Mmm.
They regard the building in silence.
ALB:
Well, I’m quite certain there’s no other building like this anywhere in the world.
GUNTHE:
I know!
I have already signed a decree that construction will begin in the spring.
PEARCE:
Really! Your Majesty has the funding all ready?
GUNTHE:
Ahh. In fact, that is why I’ve brought you here. We need to find the money to get the old shovels in the ground.
ALB:
Hopefully there’ll be more than just shovels.
GUNTHE:
Oh, indeed. Shovels in the ground, bricks on top of the ground, a… roof on top of the bricks…
ALB:
Spoken like a brilliant architect, Your Majesty.
GUNTHE:
So you two will need to coordinate and… uh, raise the funds from private sources.
PEARCE:
How much?
GUNTHE:
According to the budget calculator… five hundred and forty thousand crowns.
PEARCE:
(a strangled noise)
ALB:
And perhaps there might be a few pennies left over for repairs to the existing House of Healing?
GUNTHE:
Oh yes, we can throw that in too.
What I thought we could do is to hold a great big gala. The Queen herself will be the royal patron, and lead the fundraising campaign.
ALB:
Isn’t that lovely of her.
GUNTHE:
And as Parabel is the founding patron, it will be called… the Queen Parabel School of Medicine.
ALB:
Of course it will. Why don’t you make a building that’s shaped like her, then?
GUNTHE:
(gasps)
Alba, that’s brilliant. What was I thinking?
Ha! Unicorns indeed. I’m going to go and find Parabel right away!
He rushes out.
ALB:
And tell her to ask all her friends for money!

Episode the Fifth: A Blueprint For Success.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALING—RECEPTIO:
Pearcey’s heels echo around the room as she paces.
PEARCE:
(sighs)
Loria warned me there was something like this coming, but I had no idea it would be this bad.
Have you heard anything from the Queen yet?
ALB:
Nothing. She’s barely gone out in public lately, since, well…
PEARCE:
Since what? Is something wrong?
ALB:
You didn’t hear this from me, but she’s pregnant.
PEARCE:
Oh no. Is it far along? Do you think she’ll be able to carry out her duties as patron?
ALB:
She’ll be fine. The baby’s not due until April. But that doesn’t mean she’ll actually lift a finger to help us.
PEARCE:
It’s down to us, then. Half a million crowns for a building we didn’t ask for.
ALB:
I thought you’d be used to this sort of thing by now.
PEARCE:
And you know I’ll be the one to blame when it all goes horribly wrong.
(slowly building panic)
Oh gods, the swan boats. It’s the swan boats again…
ALB:
It’s not the swan boats.
PEARCE:
It is. I’m responsible for building someone else’s terrible idea, and I’m going to be the one who has to clean up all the blood afterward…
ALB:
Let’s keep it together. We just need a plan.
PEARCE:
(calming breaths)
Yes. A plan. All right.
Who is our main demographic? Wealthy patrons, I suppose. The nobility?
She takes out pen and paper and begins to jot notes.
ALB:
Her Majesty is still our best connection there.
PEARCE:
We might be better to focus on the wealthy merchants and industrialists, then.
ALB:
Looking to put their names on a prestigious project.
PEARCE:
And after all, they benefit from a healthy workforce.
ALB:
(sighs)
I didn’t become Royal Physician to go about begging for money.
PEARCE:
It wasn’t part of my job description either. But here we are.
Could your staff be any help to us?
ALB:
There’s a first time for everything.

EXT. DOORSTEP—DA:
Magnus knocks on the door. After a moment, it’s opened by a nervous old woman.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Yes? Can I help you?
MAGNU:
Hey, how are you, ma’am? My name is Magnus, and I’m here on behalf of the Ministry of Magical Affairs and Health…
NEIGHBOUR 1
Never heard of it.
MAGNU:
Yeah, it’s a new thing. We’re raising money to build a new school for healers…
NEIGHBOUR 1
That all sounds very nice, but I haven’t got—
MAGNU:
Okay, look. Do you like being healthy?
NEIGHBOUR 1
I suppose so?
MAGNU:
Yeah, you do. Eating, breathing, having teeth? Not dying? All that good stuff?
NEIGHBOUR 1
Sure.
MAGNU:
Now, do you know what the number one threat to your health is?
NEIGHBOUR 1
Pony pox?
MAGNU:
Nope.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Goblin fever?
MAGNU:
Wrong again. It’s Liqui-Melt… ibium Syndrome.
NEIGHBOUR 1
You what?
MAGNU:
You haven’t heard of Liqui-Meltico Syndrome? It’s a tropical disease from the south. It’s transmitted by spiders.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Ugh!
MAGNU:
Right? Did you know that the average human inhales up to sixteen spiders every night?
NEIGHBOUR 1
No! We inhale them?
MAGNU:
They’re sneaky little bastards. And now that the disease is on the move, every one of those spiders might be a carrier.
NEIGHBOUR 1
How do I know if I’ve got it?
MAGNU:
Oh, you’ll know. Trust me, you’ll know. The disease actually starts liquefying soft tissues like your brain and eyeballs and all your organs. That’s why it’s called the Squirty Plague, see? And then all that goo starts leaking out of every orifice on your body.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Gods above.
MAGNU:
Of course, before all that happens, it starts with soreness and flu-like symptoms. Do you ever have soreness in your arms and legs, or your back, or…?
NEIGHBOUR 1
Well, yeah. I’m on my feet all day at the store. I just assumed it was from working long hours…
MAGNU:
Never assume. When you assume you make a soup out of your soft tissues.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Oh dear. I need to see a healer.
MAGNU:
You should. And you know what else you should do? Donate generously to the Queen Parabel School of Medicine. We take pledges, but cash is faster and easier.
NEIGHBOUR 1
Yes. Absolutely. Wow.
MAGNU:
Just know that you may well be saving a life. Your own.

INT. HOUSE OF HEALING—RECEPTIO:
PEARCE:
Good morning, team.
HOLL:
Hi Ms Pearcey!
ALB:
You have a “bad news” look. Don’t tell me.
PEARCE:
I just found out we won’t be able to use the Great Hall at the palace.
HOLL:
Aww! Why not?
PEARCE:
They’re still cleaning up from the ball they held in honour of Prince Aquarelian and his entourage.
HOLL:
Oh, I heard about that! Didn’t they have a great big water fight? That sounded like so much fun!
ALB:
It is an honoured custom amongst the mer-people.
HOLL:
Traditions like that can be so wonderful for bringing everyone together.
PEARCE:
Not to mention costing several thousand crowns in water damage. They’re still wringing out all the tapestries.
ALB:
Well, next time the mer-people visit, perhaps His Majesty will think to host them down at the harbour.
PEARCE:
(sighs)
They brought hoses.
ALB:
So do we have another venue?
PEARCE:
The only place that’s available Friday night is the Old Coach House.
HOLL:
Yay, that’s a pretty building!
ALB:
A bit… rough and ready.
HOLL:
It has a simple home-spun charm.
PEARCE:
They’re still charging us a fortune for the booking. We’re hardly going to have anything left for food and drink.
HOLL:
No problem! I love cooking. And I can bring some of my fairy friends to help out as well!
PEARCE:
Hmm. How many friends are we talking about?
ALB:
No. Minister, think about what you’re saying.
HOLL:
It’ll save us money. We fairies are experts at foraging for wild food. And we can sing and dance while we cook!
ALB:
Can I also add: no.
PEARCE:
Well, we should still consider it, given our budget.
Holly, if you and your friends would provide us a full ingredient list ahead of time. We have to be aware of dietary restrictions.
HOLL:
Oh, but I always improvise. You know, add a little bit of whatever’s in season…
ALB:
Which is how we ended up having to fix a dozen people who ate your ginger snaps and suddenly grew tails.
HOLL:
The tails were cute!
PEARCE:
(alarmed)
Or perhaps you can help with decorating instead.
HOLL:
I can do that! We’ll fill every corner of the Old Coach House with flowers.
PEARCE:
As long as they aren’t poisonous, allergenic or covered in thorns.
HOLL:
Well…
PEARCE:
Nothing’s going to go wrong. Is that clear? No tails! No swan boats! Not again!
ALB:
I will provide a list of safe flower varieties.
PEARCE:
Good. Good.
HOLL:
Okay. Is there anything else I can do to help? Please?
PEARCE:
Let’s talk about the gala later. How has the door-to-door campaign been going?
ALB:
We’re up to forty-five hundred crowns.
PEARCE:
A bit slower than I’d hoped.
ALB:
Well, there were a few hiccups early on… but we fixed them.

EXT. DOORSTE:
Magnus knocks on the door. It’s opened by a gruff older man.
NEIGHBOUR 2
Yes? Hello?
MAGNU:
Hey, how are you, sir? My name is Magnus, and I’m here on behalf of the Ministry of Magical Affairs and Health…
NEIGHBOUR 2
Yeah, I have no idea what that is.
MAGNU:
We are building a brand new school so we can teach lots more healers and heal lots more people. Sounds great, right? Right. They’re gonna be out there fixing bones and smacking babies and removing unwanted tails…
NEIGHBOUR 2
Removing what?
MAGNU:
So you can see why your donation is so important.
NEIGHBOUR 2
“My donation.” Yeah, right, buddy. Let me guess, you only take cash.
MAGNU:
(he struggles for a moment)
Why… no. I am not allowed to accept cash donations.
NEIGHBOUR 2
Yeah? Why not?
MAGNU:
Because my boss doesn’t trust me not to steal the donations for myself.
Wait, what the hell is going on?
NEIGHBOUR 2
What kinda scam is this?
MAGNU:
Yes, I totally came here to scam you. Dammit! Stop asking me questions!
NEIGHBOUR 2
Is this some kind of weird double bluff?
What’s your name, kid? Who do you work for?
MAGNU:
Magnus of Hezelford. I work for Alba Salix, the Royal Physician… who apparently slipped me a truth potion before I went out this morning. The damn witch!
NEIGHBOUR 2
You work for the Royal Physician.
MAGNU:
Yes! I’m her apprentice. Look, I’ve taken up enough of your time—
Magnus starts backing away, but the man grabs him by the arm.
NEIGHBOUR 2
Not so fast. I’m turning you in, you little fraud.
MAGNU:
Ow! Let go!
NEIGHBOUR 2
“Ministry of Magical Affairs”. What kind of fool do you think I am?
MAGNU:
A big one, I figured, but apparently you’re much smarter than you—ow! It’s true! Everything I’ve said is true. The Ministry, the school thing…
NEIGHBOUR 2
You said it was a scam.
MAGNU:
No, the fundraising part is real, I was just stealing donations.
NEIGHBOUR 2
Well, you picked the wrong guy to try and rip off.
MAGNU:
No argument here!
NEIGHBOUR 2
I was a sergeant in the town guard. You know what we did with little creeps like you?
MAGNU:
Ow! I warn you, I know many unarmed moves that I hope look intimidating but actually kind of suck in a real fight—dammit!
NEIGHBOUR 2
I guess the question is, do I report this to your boss, or should I turn you in to the town guard?
MAGNU:
Town guard, definitely town guard.
NEIGHBOUR 2
All right, back to the witch it is.
MAGNU:
I’m begging you, man! Turn me in!

INT. BALLROO:
Holly flutters across the room as she works. We hear rustling, like leaves, and an unsteady creaking sound.
HOLL:
(singing)
Welcome, welcome, you’re just in time… to help us build a brand new school, la la la!
Magnus is working, closer at hand.
MAGNU:
Argh! Dammit… Holly, are you sure these are the “safe” flowers?
HOLL:
Magnus! I’m ready for the next garland. Come on! We need to finish!
She touches down beside Magnus.
MAGNU:
Just hold your horses. I’ve got blisters from stringing all these stupid garlands.
HOLL:
Well, if you didn’t want to be stringing stupid garlands in the stupid ballroom, you shouldn’t have tried stealing money from our donors.
MAGNU:
Stupid donors. Stupid retired cop donors.
Here’s your garland. Are we done now?
HOLL:
Stay put. I’m not supposed to let you out of my sight.
Holly flies up and starts tying the garland.
HOLL:
Wait, it’s not going to reach. Magnus! The garland’s too short!
MAGNU:
Yeah, well, I ran out of twine! Look, just tie it to one of the arms of the chandelier.
HOLL:
But then it won’t be symmetrical.
MAGNU:
So, do the same thing on the other side.
HOLL:
We can’t waste any more time. Ms Pearcey’s going to be back here any minute.
MAGNU:
I know! Look—go ahead and tie it off and we’ll fix it later.
HOLL:
Okay, okay.
Holly flutters about.
MAGNU:
See? It’s fine. It’s on the far side, so she won’t even notice.
Holly finishes and touches down.
HOLL:
There.
MAGNU:
Nice.
HOLL:
All right. Let’s start setting up the tables.
MAGNU:
Sure. Give me a minute. I just want to enjoy the feeling of having arms, while I still can.
HOLL:
The garlands do look pretty good from here!
MAGNU:
Right?
Well, I guess we better get on with—
Part of the chandelier gives way with a groan. The garland rustles, and metal and cut glass smash on the floor.
HOLL:
Aaaa!
MAGNU:
Oh boy.
HOLL:
Get a broom!
They run around trying to clean up.
MAGNU:
I told you we shouldn’t have tied it to the chandelier.
HOLL:
You…!
She hits him.
MAGNU:
Ow! Hey! Physical assault in the workplace!
The door opens, and Pearcey enters with an armful of flowers.
PEARCE:
Holly, Magnus, I’ve brought the flowers for the centrepieces. How are you doing with the…
(she notices the mess)
…tables?
MAGNU:
Hey… hello, Madam Minister.
PEARCE:
(icy silence, then)
Well. There’s another five hundred crowns down the privy.
HOLL:
I’m sorry, Ms Pearcey!
MAGNU:
It’s all good. This gala is supposed to bring in money. That’s kind of the whole idea, right?
PEARCE:
Yes. We’re expecting fifty of the richest people in the kingdom to come and give us money. And look at this place. Honestly. A broken chandelier. Stems and leaves and glass everywhere.
HOLL:
We’re cleaning up!
MAGNU:
It’s all under control, your ministerialness.
PEARCE:
All right. Deep breaths. Let’s take it one step at a time—
The other arm of the chandelier falls off with a crash. Everyone gives a shout of alarm.
HOLL:
Aaa! Watch out!
PEARCE:
(sighs)
MAGNU:
Well hey, at least it’s symmetrical again.
PEARCE:
Get. This. Cleaned. Up.
HOLL:
Yes, Ms Pearcey.
They start sweeping up.
MAGNU:
So… those new flowers sure look nice.
PEARCE:
Yes. The rest are on the way from the florist. For the love of Loxsyn, don’t break all the vases as well.
MAGNU:
(under his breath, mocking)
“Don’t break all the vases as well…”
HOLL:
Wait… these are orange vipertongues.
PEARCE:
That’s right.
HOLL:
They’re not on Alba’s list!
PEARCE:
Yes they are…
HOLL:
No they’re not! Who ordered them?
PEARCE:
I did. It was… a special request.
MAGNU:
Vipertongues, huh? Do they cause swift and painful death?
HOLL:
They can cause mild sinus allergies in some humans.
MAGNU:
Boo. You can’t name something that lame after a viper.
PEARCE:
All right. We don’t have time to change them. Just set up the tables, please.
HOLL:
All right, but if someone sneezes themselves to death, don’t say I didn’t warn you!

Why aren’t you getting ready for the gala tonight? I thought you’d be excited to spend the evening with your friends… see and be seen, enjoy yourself.
PARABEL
I don’t think I can.
GUNTHE:
Why ever not?
PARABEL
I’m not feeling well.
GUNTHE:
Because of the baby?
PARABEL
Yes… the baby.
GUNTHE:
You could put in a brief appearance, surely. You had that lovely pink dress picked out…
PARABEL
It doesn’t fit any more.
GUNTHE:
We just had it adjusted! Come now. Let’s see.
PARABEL
It doesn’t fit.
GUNTHE:
Surely the baby’s not growing that fast. Is it?
PARABEL
Look.
She stands up.
GUNTHE:
Oh. Oh good heavens. I could swear you were half that size only yesterday.
PARABEL
Why, thank you, darling.
GUNTHE:
I didn’t mean it as a criticism! That is a royal baby in there, after all.
PARABEL
As I said, the dress doesn’t fit.
GUNTHE:
This is happening rather quickly, isn’t it? Should we be worried?
PARABEL
No, no, Alba says it’s just a… super-expansionary pregnancy, I think she called it.
GUNTHE:
Oh dear, that does sound dangerous.
PARABEL
Oh, no. She says it’s nothing to be worried about.
GUNTHE:
Ah, good! Then you can go to the gala.
PARABEL
It’s just so uncomfortable.
GUNTHE:
Just for a few minutes.
PARABEL
Very, very, uncomfortable.
GUNTHE:
Then we’d better get Alba back here to see you.
PARABEL
Not that uncomfortable!
GUNTHE:
Parabel, dear, your people need you. It’ll be your name on this new building, and your face, smiling down at every bright young student, every loopy old wizard who steps through its doors!
PARABEL
(softening)
Yes.
GUNTHE:
Not to mention the rumours that will spread if you don’t show up.
PARABEL
(sighs)
All right, darling. I’ll go.
GUNTHE:
Thank you. We’ll get the tailors in here right away to see to that dress. You’ll look magnificent.

I always do…

Yes, that’s true.

The Palace caterers are nowhere to be found. To say nothing of—
The door opens. Alba hurries in from the rain—it’s pouring outside.
PEARCE:
Ahh, there you are.
ALB:
Yes. Sorry, there was an emergency back at the House of Healing.
HOLL:
Oh no! What happened?
ALB:
An outbreak of pony pox.
PEARCE:
Well, get changed. Holly, I need you to fly up to the Palace and find out where on earth the royal caterers are.
HOLL:
Sure thing!
ALB:
No, no, don’t bother. I know exactly where they are.
PEARCE:
Where—oh no.
ALB:
Yup.
PEARCE:
Oh, no, no, no…
HOLL:
Well, don’t keep us in suspense. Where are they?
ALB:
At the House of Healing, recovering from a massive bout of pony pox.
HOLL:
Oh my gosh! All of them?
PEARCE:
I don’t suppose any of them are well enough to cook?
ALB:
And infect all our guests?
PEARCE:
Oh no, no, no.
(to Magnus and Holly)
Well, don’t just stand there, you two—get to work. Cooking!
MAGNU:
Us?
HOLL:
You got it! Cooking is my most favourite thing ever.
MAGNU:
Couldn’t we just make the dinner appear by magic? Like the Sorceror General used to do for banquets and things?
ALB:
That was all illusion. Someone had to actually make the food first.
MAGNU:
Great. So we’re screwed, in other words.
ALB:
Magnus, I have had a long day that is only getting longer. I need you two to go into that kitchen, find something on the menu that you think you can cook, and cook it.
HOLL:
You got it! We’ll take it from here.
PEARCE:
Good. Alba, get dressed. Our guests will be arriving soon, and then we’ll have to… mingle.
(she shudders)
ALB:
Yes. Good luck with that.
PEARCE:
Oh no. You’ve got to do your fair share too, Ms Salix. Come on. I’ve written out some sample donor conversations to practice.

Fine.

Good evening, Your Ladyship! Hello, unknown gentleman!

Hello, darling.

Good heavens. Yes, there are certain… vegetal notes to it.
Holly, what on earth is this?
HOLL:
Fairy moonshine! It’s wholesome and nourishing. Contains twelve essential nutrients required to build stronger wings and add shine to your hair. If you had wings, I mean. Only the best for our wonderful donors!
PEARCE:
(whispers)
You made moonshine out of our dinner?
HOLL:
We had a problem with the hors d’oeuvres. Magnus is moving on to the soup course.

Boy, this stuff does kind of grow on you, doesn’t it.

Mister Preston is one of our most generous donors.

That’s wonderful.

Well, magic is our business, you know, and we’re very interested in giving back to the magical community…
ALB:
What business would that be?
PRESTO:
I am the head of Mysticorp Energy, ma’am.
ALB:
(suddenly dark)
Mysticorp—oh. Yes.
PRESTO:
The kingdom’s largest exporter of mystical energy!
ALB:
I’m aware. Extracting energy straight from the loo lines isn’t the safest of practices.
PEARCE:
(whispers)
Ms Salix…
PRESTO:
We take every precaution—
ALB:
What was it now? Two major spills in the last year?
PRESTO:
Now listen, those were sabotage by our competitors.
ALB:
Not to mention the earthquakes, and the rain of skunks back in April.
PEARCE:
Well! I must say, it was very good of Mister Preston to attend our little fundraiser, especially on such a stormy night.
PRESTO:
Oh, it’s my pleasure. At least it’s only raining water, eh? Heh heh.
PEARCE:
We are certainly very grateful for his presence and his company’s generous donation. Aren’t we, Ms Salix?
ALB:
Yes. Yes, that is very good of him.
PEARCE:
It’s been lovely chatting with you, sir.
PRESTO:
Likewise!
PEARCE:

Why do you have to provoke our donors?
ALB:
Force of habit.

Can you wait to do it until after our school is built?

Yes, you’re right, I’m sorry.

MAGNU:
I’m working on it! I’m trying to get an assembly line going here. So we just place the vegetables here. The knives chop them and lift them into the pot…
HOLL:
What, by themselves? Oh no, Magnus, don’t you dare try cooking with magic.
MAGNU:
We can’t feed all those people by hand! Watch, it’s gonna be fine.
(tries to remember)
Uh… so it’s… Nimis multi pomari!
Shing! Several knives spring into the air and hang there, clinking softly.
HOLL:
Aaa! Magnus, if you’re going to use magic, use it for things that don’t involve knives!
MAGNU:
It’s okay! It’s okay. Um… I dunno why they’re just floating there.
Nimis multi… pomarii?
The knives all begin chopping violently. Magnus and Holly both shout in alarm.

Okay! That worked better than I expected.

You don’t say!
CRONCIBL:
Yes, you see… these days the smart money is in carpets.
PEARCE:
Oh dear.
ALB:
What, shipping by carpet?
CRONCIBL:
Absolutely! Those Niamondese flying carpets are the wave of the future.
PEARCE:
Ah, how fascinating!
ALB:
Ms. Pearcey, didn’t you issue a report on freight carpets while you were Minister of Transportation?
PEARCE:
Oh, yes, just some preliminary findings…
ALB:
I think the conclusion was “inefficient and a risk to cargo and crew”.
CRONCIBL:
Oh, no, no, no, now there ya go. These modern ones are perfectly safe, dear lady. They’ve got bracing and active damping. We’ve even got side rails… No more being dumped overboard when a breeze comes up!
PEARCE:
Yes, you see, Ms Salix? Probably worth another look.
ALB:
Yes, I’m sure you’re right.
My, aren’t these flowers lovely?
PEARCE:
(instantly)
Don’t smell the flowers.
Does that mean you’ve solved the weight ratio problem, Your Lordship?
ALB:
Yes, didn’t I read that the bracing is so heavy they can barely carry a single banana?
CRONCIBL:
Bah! Simple technical challenges. The fourth-generation carpets use hollow bracing, so now we can carry a substantially much greater payload!

Two bananas?

Uh, I’m just here helping out.
ATEN-ABE:
Withrow Lee! Well, I’ll be danged. You used to call on us Guardians all the time, you and that Alba Salix girl.
WITHRO:
That was us, yeah.
ATEN-ABE:
Which means you must be Parabel Salix, right?
PARABEL
Yes, I am. If we could get down to business.
ATEN-ABE:
Yeah, it’s all clicking into place now.
All right. Lay it on me.
PARABEL
I am with child.
ATEN-ABE:
Nice. Congrats.
PARABEL
Alba tells me the child will be a boy.
ATEN-ABE:
Yep, it’s looking that way.
PARABEL
Which would make him heir apparent, and void our enemies’ claim to the throne. The moment they learn a crown prince has been born, his life will be in mortal peril.
ATEN-ABE:
Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense.
PARABEL
But you have power over destiny.
ATEN-ABE:
I can push the world toward one future or another. If you wanted a girl, you should have talked to me before you went and got preggers.
PARABEL
Well, what good are you, then?!
Mister Lee, couldn’t you have summoned me a proper demon?
ATEN-ABE:
That hurts.
WITHRO:
It was short notice. Everybody’s booked up on the full moon. It was this guy or Sovono-gargh, the god of snails.
PARABEL
Rrr! Unbelievable. Send him away!
ATEN-ABE:
Now, hold on. Let’s think this through. Magical power runs in your family.
PARABEL
Yes…?
ATEN-ABE:
Am I right? Look at you. Look at your sisters. So. What if I told you… I can make your kid the most powerful wizard alive?
PARABEL
How powerful?
ATEN-ABE:
Powerful enough that no one can harm him. Your boy shall have all your magic—all the magic of your whole bloodline put together. I can make him so powerful that the land of his birth shall never fall to its enemies so long as he lives.
PARABEL
What must I do?
ATEN-ABE:
(laughs)
FADE TO:
INT. STOREROO:
Parabel gasps for breath.
The door squeaks open.
ALB:
Parabel?
Parabel. What are you doing in the storeroom?
Are you all right?
PARABEL
I’m fine. I just needed to—oh!
(she gasps as another contraction hits)
ALB:
Parabel!
PARABEL
I think I’m… Oh no!
I think… I might be… having the baby.
ALB:
Really! You don’t say.
PARABEL
Alba… I’m… I may have done something… OH FLUKI ABOVE!
ALB:
Shhh. Breathe. Focus on your breathing.
Well, if you’re going to have a baby six months early, at least you’re doing it somewhere with plenty of clean towels.
She fetches some towels.
PARABEL
Please… if you have to choose between me and the baby…
ALB:
Don’t you dare even say it.
PARABEL
Save the child, Alba.
ALB:
Breathe.
A sudden tearing, rushing noise, similar to the previous scene.
ALB:
What on earth?
ATEN-ABE:
Hey hey. It looks like I’m just in time.
ALB:
Aten-Aben.
ATEN-ABE:
Alba Salix! I was hoping I’d see you here too. It’s been forever!
ALB:
What in all the hells are you doing here?
ATEN-ABE:
I’d have thought that would have been obvious. I’m here for the baby.
PARABEL
(groans)
OPENING THEM:
HERAL:
By Appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician—Volume Two!
Episode the Sixth: Signed, Sealed, Delivered.
INT. KITCHEN:
A clatter of cutlery.
MAGNU:
Holly! Ow! The spoons are trying to kill me!
They descend on him with little whooshes, and crack him vigorously on the head.
HOLL:
Well, that’s what you get for animating them!
MAGNU:
Ow! I’m not a creme brulee! Dammit! Ow!
Finally, he manages to fend them off. Spoons jingle noisily across the floor.
A set of pans clatter at Holly.
HOLL:
Don’t you start too! I don’t care what the pots said! All you pans get back to the stove! I have a ladle and I know how to use it.
The pans rattle irritably.
HOLL:
Now let’s taste that soup.
A pan snaps its lid shut at her.
HOLL:
Ow! Why you nasty little…! Let me taste your soup!
She smacks the snapping lid with a ladle.
HOLL:
Gimme. Come on!
Magnus, now! The lid!
Magnus runs over and grabs the lid.
MAGNU:
Ha! Got it.
HOLL:
Thanks!
MAGNU:
Ow, ow, it’s hot it’s hot it’s hot!
Holly stirs the “soup”.
HOLL:
Hold onto it!
Hey, this isn’t soup, it’s just hot water with some onions in it.
MAGNU:
The knives stole the rest of the ingredients. They’ve been hoarding them all in the top cupboard.
HOLL:
What? Why?
MAGNU:
How should I know? Stupid knives.
A dozen knives go shing!
MAGNU:
Sorry, I mean, very nice, shiny knives. You’re all super great and I think we should be friends!
HOLL:
Whoa, look out! Plates incoming!
The plates clink together as they close in.
MAGNU:
We’re surrounded.
HOLL:
(sings)
Hello bowls! Hello plates!
MAGNU:
What are you doing?
HOLL:
I don’t know—maybe they like music?
(sings)
What’s wrong? Was it something you ate?
The plates rattle louder.
MAGNU:
I don’t think they like music.
HOLL:
Let’s back away slowly.
CUT TO:
INT. BALLROO:
Anxious chatter.
GUNTHE:
We’ll be back on track in just a second. The Royal Physician has gone off to look after Parabel. She has everything under control.
The doors burst open and Holly and Magnus tumble out into the ballroom, screaming and pursued by cutlery. A few guests scream as well.
GUNTHE:
What on earth?
PEARCE:
Magnus! Holly! What is this?
MAGNU:
We’re having some minor technical issues in the kitchen.
HOLL:
Magnus! Make them stop!
PEARCE:
Why are there forks and knives following you?
The knives follow, with whispery sounds of metal on metal.
MAGNU:
(crawling backwards)
See, that’s a long story that hopefully I will live to tell you later.
(whimpers)
Nice cutlery!
C’mon, you wouldn’t hurt the one who brought you to life? Would you?
A tense silence. Then the knives and forks all abruptly crash to the ground. Magnus and Holly gasp in relief.
HOLL:
So, who’s hungry?
MUSIC STIN:
INT. STOREROO:
The storm rages outside.
PARABEL
Alba… Don’t let him near me. Don’t let him hurt the baby.
ATEN-ABE:
I would never hurt the baby. I’m simply escorting him to his new home.
ALB:
Begone, demon!
ATEN-ABE:
Go ahead. Hit me with your best shot.
ALB:
Aten-Aben, diabolum! Aten-Aben, exeas! Aten-Aben, effugare!
She summons a swirling magic wind, but it fizzles out to nothing.
ATEN-ABE:
(laughs)
Somebody a bit short on power?
ALB:
Is this your doing?
ATEN-ABE:
I am only following Her Majesty’s wishes.
ALB:
Parabel…
PARABEL
He promised my son would be the most powerful wizard alive.
ATEN-ABE:
And he will be! But you can’t just create that much power out of nowhere. It’s much easier to borrow. From the family, as it were.
ALB:
You’ve given all our power to the baby.
ATEN-ABE:
Yup.
ALB:
That’s too much for one person to handle. You’re endangering him. And everyone around him.
PARABEL
You didn’t tell me any of this!
ATEN-ABE:
You didn’t ask.
PARABEL
And now you’re here to take him away?
ATEN-ABE:
He’s going to be quite the star back home.
PARABEL
You promised he would be the defender of Farloria.
ATEN-ABE:
Mmmmnope, I don’t recall saying anything about Farloria. I believe it was: “The land of his birth shall never fall to its enemies so long as he lives.”
PARABEL
But we’re in Farloria.
ATEN-ABE:
Yes, but… shhh.
They fall silent. The wind howls fiercely. The walls of the building begin to creak and groan.
ATEN-ABE:
That’s our ride.
Wood splinters. The whole building shakes violently.
ATEN-ABE:
(laughs)
PARABEL
What are you doing?
ATEN-ABE:
The child will be born in my kingdom.
The walls groan and crack.
ATEN-ABE:
It’s pretty nice, as hell dimensions go. Good neighbours. Spectacular scenery. Warm all year round. He’s gonna love it.
Come on, let’s go.
Bricks crumble and wood splinters as the building lifts off into the air.
CUT TO:
INT. BALLROO:
Crashing and creaking. Guests tumble to the floor as the building sways and furniture slides across the room. Gale-force winds shake the walls.
LADY JONEWOO:
What’s happening?!
LORD JONEWOO:
Dear me, it’s quite the storm out there now, isn’t it?
LADY JONEWOO:
I should say it is. It’s lifting us right into the air!
GUNTHE:
Oh dear. Parabel! Has anyone seen the Queen? Darling, where are you?
He stumbles out to the hall.
PEARCE:
No! Your Majesty!
(too late—she groans)
Everyone! Try to grab onto a wall. Make your way up here to the stage so you don’t get hit by the furniture. Hold on to each other for safety.
HOLL:
Magnus! You didn’t magically animate the whole building, did you?
MAGNU:
Are you kidding? I barely managed to levitate some knives.
HOLL:
Which nearly killed us.
Aten-Aben’s amplified voice rings out.
ATEN-ABE:
Your Majesties, ladies, gentlemen… This is your captain speaking, welcoming you aboard this nonstop flight from Grandville to the hell dimension of Qwaytox. Please stay seated. Keep your soles on the floor. You may experience some turbulence as we make our ascent.
Screams as the room lurches.
MAGNU:
See? He said “hell dimension”. We’re being stolen away by demons! I’ve got nothing to do with it!
HOLL:
Then why have your eyes gone red?
MAGNU:
The kitchen was kinda smoky?
HOLL:
Glowing red.
MAGNU:
Whatever. You’ve been drinking too much moonshine.
HOLL:
Also… you’re floating two feet off the floor.
MAGNU:
I’m what? Whoa! What the hell?
HOLL:
I told you. I think you’re possessed or something!
MAGNU:
Ha! How cool is this?! I wonder if I can fly?
A whoosh. Magnus cries out as he runs smack into the wall.
HOLL:
Magnus!
MAGNU:
(panting)
Ow. Okay. I’m okay. Just… stuck to the wall, apparently.
LORD JONEWOO:
I say, this is a bit more exciting than the Jackalope Sanctuary fundraiser, what?
HOLL:
Magnus, what did you do?!
MAGNU:
I swear, it wasn’t me!
EXT. FOREST, MIDNIGH:
A discordant shimmer of magic.
ATEN-ABE:
It is done.
PARABEL
Just like that?
ATEN-ABE:
Yes. All that remains is for you to await the birth.
PARABEL
Good. Good.
WITHRO:
So… are we all done here?
ATEN-ABE:
Just one question.
PARABEL
Yes, O demon.
ATEN-ABE:
There’s a boy lying in the bushes.
WITHRO:
There’s—what? No…
PARABEL
(hisses)
I thought you said you hid him!
WITHRO:
I did!
ATEN-ABE:
I can sense his body heat.
Who is this?
WITHRO:
The kid? Oh, he’s nobody important. I already made him forget what he saw tonight.
MAGNU:
(snores)
PARABEL
And you’re absolutely sure about that? If Alba finds out…
ATEN-ABE:
What’s this about Alba?
PARABEL
Oh, nothing…
(struck by a sudden thought)
Would you care for a sacrifice? Would that help with the baby’s destiny?
WITHRO:
No, no! If Magnus goes missing, Alba’s gonna start figuring things out.
ATEN-ABE:
Does this boy work for her?
WITHRO:
He’s her apprentice.
ATEN-ABE:
Is he really! And she’s the Royal Physician now, yes?
PARABEL
Yes. Yes, she is.
ATEN-ABE:
Well then, this should work out perfectly.
PARABEL
Yes?
ATEN-ABE:
When it comes time for the baby to be born…
A magical shimmer.
MAGNU:
(gasps in his sleep)
ATEN-ABE:
young Magnus here shall assist with the delivery.
FADE TO:
INT. BALLROO:
MAGNU:
Seriously, all I did was float some dishes. I can’t fly a whole building full of people.
HOLL:
Try it, though! Maybe… think about veering to the left?
MAGNU:
Veering to the left… veering…!
No.
HOLL:
No, really, really concentrate on it.
MAGNU:
All right, all right.
(grunts through gritted teeth)
The whole building creaks. A few screams from the guests.
HOLL:
There! There it is!
MAGNU:
(in sudden agony)
Aghhh!
HOLL:
Oh geez. Magnus, are you okay?
MAGNU:
(groans)
Okay, maybe you’re right. It feels like I’m being pulled through the air towards something. But I can’t control it. Holly… it’s… the second I try, it’s like I’m being stabbed in both ears!
HOLL:
Okay. Okay, deep breaths.
MAGNU:
(calming)
Aw, man…
HOLL:
Just… stay put. I’m going to go find Alba.
She flies off.
MAGNU:
I’m stuck to this wall. Where am I gonna go?
I mean, besides Hell.
MUSIC STIN:
INT. STOREROO:
ALB:
So why don’t you just transport her to your dimension? Why fly a whole building all the way across the planar convergence?
ATEN-ABE:
Style, my good woman.
ALB:
You don’t have the power to do it yourself.
ATEN-ABE:
(caught out)
I’m flying the building, aren’t I?
ALB:
Are you?
ATEN-ABE:
Not long now! We should be crossing out of this dimension in just a few minutes. How’s the patient?
PARABEL
(under her breath)
The patient will see you burn in your own hellfire.
ALB:
She’s fine.
ATEN-ABE:
Excellent. Still a good while between contractions? Can’t have the baby arrive until we’re safely on terra inferna.
PARABEL
So my child will be king in Hell?
ATEN-ABE:
Oh yes. My home country, to begin with, but with his power we could rule whole continents.
PARABEL
And what’s to become of me, then?
GUNTHE:
(through the door)
Parabel? Parabel, are you in there?
PARABEL
Gunther!
GUNTHE:
(through the door)
Parabel! I’m coming.
The door rattles, but it’s locked.
ATEN-ABE:
Oh, no, no, no.
This simply will not do.
PARABEL
Gunther!
Gunther takes a running start. The door bursts open and he tumbles into the room.
PARABEL
(gasps)
Oh my.
GUNTHE:
Darling! You’re safe.
ALB:
Gunther, run!
GUNTHE:
Why? What’s going on?
ATEN-ABE:
The witch is right. We can’t have the husband present.
Gunther strides over.
GUNTHE:
Who on earth are you? Explain yourself, sir!
ATEN-ABE:
Am I right, Alba? Men—they always think they can handle it, and halfway through they faint, just like that.
He snaps his fingers. A sharp crackle of magical energy and Gunther collapses to the floor with a groan.
PARABEL
Gunther! No!
ALB:
Gunther!
PARABEL
(cold fury)
What have you done to him?
ATEN-ABE:
He’s just asleep, probably.
What does it matter?
PARABEL
That is my husband. The King of Farloria. Father of my child.
ATEN-ABE:
And no harm will come to him if you behave yourself.
PARABEL
(steely)
Yes. Of course.
Alba has moved over to examine Gunther.
ALB:
He’s breathing.
ATEN-ABE:
Told you.
ALB:
Hmm. His Majesty’s pupils look normal. I think he’ll be all right.
PARABEL
Well, that’s something.
HOLL:
(whispers)
Alba!
ALB:
(startled gasp, then, in a barely audible whisper)
Holly. Get out of sight.
ATEN-ABE:
What’s that?
ALB:
Nothing.
ATEN-ABE:
Who are you talking to?
CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY—CONTINUOU:
We hear the roar of the wind, and Holly’s breathing, very close. The voices of Parabel, Alba and Aten-Aben emerge from the room.
ALB:
No one. Just myself. Clearly this tense situation is getting to me.
Holly’s wings flutter as she flies up to the rafters.
ATEN-ABE:
There had better not be anyone out in the hall.
As he speaks, he pokes his head out the door. Holly holds her breath.
ATEN-ABE:
Hmph. I could have sworn I heard someone.
He slams the door. The voices are muffled now.
ALB:
I told you. It’s just me and the voices in my head.
ATEN-ABE:
You talk too much.
ALB:
We do, don’t we Parabel? We’re so fairy talkative. Fairy, fairy talkative.
PARABEL
What’s that supposed to mean?
ALB:
It would be fairy good indeed and help people…
HOLL:
(gasps)
ALB:
…if you were to get hold of your tongue.
PARABEL
What? Do you think I should have been the quiet and dutiful little girl, while you lectured me at every turn?
ATEN-ABE:
Both of you be quiet.
ALB:
I’m just saying. Parabel just has a tongue like a viper. It’s practically poisonous.
PARABEL
You’re one to talk.
ATEN-ABE:
I won’t ask you again.
ALB:
What? Blame her. And her poisonous viper tongue.
ATEN-ABE:
One more word and I’m going to chuck your beloved king overboard. Understood?
ALB:
Mm hmm.
HOLL:
(whispers)
You got it, Alba. We’re on the case.
MUSIC STIN:
INT. PEARCEY’S APARTMEN:
LEO:
Today, 10 to 10:15am.
Stop in at florist to change order for centrepieces: fifty orange vipertongue blooms.
PEARCE:
Florist?
LEO:
Apologize to them for last-minute change but make request top priority.
PEARCE:
When did even I put that in the calendar?
Loria enters, dressing for work.
LORI:
What’s up, babe?
PEARCE:
Nothing, just… another new appointment I don’t remember making.
LORI:
Spooky. Like when it told you to buy an umbrella?
PEARCE:
Yes… and I wish I had. I got drenched without one.
LORI:
So, just to be clear, you’ve got a piece of rock possessed by a dead guy…
PEARCE:
I have a Prescient Outsourced Presence who tracks my schedule.
LORI:
And fills it with random things.
PEARCE:
Only occasionally. And they’ve been very useful random things.
LORI:
Now you’re all “Trust Leon. He’s always right.”
PEARCE:
I thought you liked him.
LORI:
I’m just saying. You better not lead my Tally wrong, Mister Rock, or you’re gonna be paving a road. Got me?
LEO:
I strive for reliability and accuracy.
PEARCE:
Is that everything in the calendar, Leon?
LEO:
No further events. I have cleared your schedule in case of further contingencies.
PEARCE:
Good.
This gala is going to be the end of me.
LORI:
You’re gonna be fine. You got this. You always do.
PEARCE:
No swan boats.
LORI:
No swan boats! You’re gonna be amazing.
PEARCE:
Thanks, love. See you tonight.
They kiss.
LORI:
There’s a ton of paperwork coming down, so I’m probably gonna be a bit late. Save me some wine?
PEARCE:
I will.
Loria heads out. The door shuts behind her.
FADE TO:
INT. BALLROO:
Nervous chatter amongst the guests as the building flies onward.
PEARCE:
(to herself)
No swan boats. No swan boats.
(aloud)
Everyone, please calm down. Let’s not jump to any hasty conclusions.
MAGNU:
Yeah, exactly! The reason I am stuck halfway up this wall is because of a rare equilibrium between the aero-static forces and… the fabric of my robe.
PRESTO:
What’s wrong with your eyes?
MAGNU:
Nothing! I am simply tired from cooking… and so I am keeping my eyes shut so that they can rest.
LADY JONEWOO:
He’s in league with the demon!
LORD JONEWOO:
Yes, yes! Out the window with him!
MAGNU:
No! Guys! Listen, I’m pretty sure I’m the only thing keeping this building from crashing to the ground.
Holly bursts back in and begins flying rapidly around the room, gathering flowers.
HOLL:
(shouting as she flies)
Everyone! I need your help.
PEARCE:
Where are the King and Queen? Are they safe?
HOLL:
They’re in the back. Alba’s with them.
PEARCE:
And the demon?
HOLL:
Yes. He’s got them in the storeroom.
Gasps and mutters.
HOLL:
But Alba figured it out! All we have to do is gather up all the flowers from the centrepieces.
PEARCE:
What?
HOLL:
They’re called vipertongues.
PEARCE:
Of course! That’s what they were for.
Yes. Everyone, please gather up the orange flowers and give them to Holly.
PRESTO:
Ugh. No, get those things away from me!
(sneezes)
PEARCE:
(to Holly)
Some of our guests have been sneezing all night. So do these cause more severe reactions in demonic species?
HOLL:
Exactly! We’re going to smoke this demon out, everybody!
Which I’m feeling a little bit conflicted about. I mean, we’re healers. We’re not supposed to harm anyone, but… he is doing very bad things.
PEARCE:
I think we can safely make an exception.
MUSIC STIN:

Six hundred and sixty-six souls in a bag, six hundred and sixty-six souls…
You’re not singing!

take one down, thrash it around—
(sneezes)
ALB:
Bless you.
ATEN-ABE:
Very funny.
(sniffs, sneezes)
What’s that smell?
ALB:
(feigning innocence)
What smell?
PARABEL
I smell flowers.
(sneezes)
ATEN-ABE:
Ugh. What is going on?!
(sneezes again)
This is some sort of trick!
ALB:
It’s probably just the catering staff. They’ve been having a lot of trouble in the kitchen.
ATEN-ABE:
(shivering with cold)
Witch! What have you done to me?
ALB:
I haven’t done anything.
ATEN-ABE:
Liar.
ALB:
You took all my magic, remember?
ATEN-ABE:
Tell me what is happening!
ALB:
(with exaggerated sympathy)
Oh dear. You’re going a bit purple. Are you cold?
ATEN-ABE:
Yes!
ALB:
I’d say it looks like APF.
ATEN-ABE:
Which is?
ALB:
Acute Pyrostatic Failure. A dangerous condition for a demon. Your core temperature is plummeting.
ATEN-ABE:
(now gasping for breath)
You poisoned me.
ALB:
Did I? Have I left this room?
ATEN-ABE:
You were passing messages to your staff. All that talk about poison and tongues… It was code. This is some kind of toxin, isn’t it?
ALB:
You demons really have to be careful when you leave your home dimension. It’s freezing cold up here.
ATEN-ABE:
You’re going to pay for this.
Aten-Aben staggers forward, but Parabel suddenly pushes her way between them.
PARABEL
Oh no. You will not touch my sister.
ALB:
Parabel.
ATEN-ABE:
Out of the way, Queen.
PARABEL
Surely you wouldn’t do anything to harm the baby.
ATEN-ABE:
I could do a lot to you to without harming the baby. Besides, I intend to claim custody of the child once he’s born. And I can only do that if he’s an orphan.
PARABEL
Why, you loathsome creature.
ATEN-ABE:
It’s called How to Get Ahead in Hell. If something’s getting in your way, destroy it.
He rises and walks over to Gunther.
ATEN-ABE:
In fact, let’s start right at the top.
It’s been a good reign for old King Gunther, hasn’t it?
Another magical charge begins to build. Aten-Aben strains mightily.
PARABEL
Stop this!
ATEN-ABE:
He’s probably not gonna rate more than a page or two in the history books, but who knows? I guess that’s gonna be a question for the scholars.
PARABEL
No! Gunther!
The magic builds to a crescendo—then Alba slams a chair into Aten-Aben’s head. He staggers, and the magic dies instantly.
ATEN-ABE:
Augh! Dammit!
ALB:
I might not have magic, but luckily, we’re locked up in a storeroom full of chairs.
ATEN-ABE:
Get away from me, human!
(straining)
ALB:
Aww, is somebody short on power?
ATEN-ABE:
(panting)
Witch! I will throw you in the Dungeon of Thorns myself. A few centuries there should rid you of that smugness.
He tries another spell, but it’s weaker still. An icy crackling
ALB:
That’s another symptom of APF. Your body’s Lugosi cells are shutting down. You’re out of power too, Aten-Aben.
PARABEL
Yes, demon. How does it feel?!
Parabel picks up another chair and hits him as well. Aten-Aben groans and slumps to the floor.
ALB:
Nice swing.
PARABEL
Thank you.
Good heavens. Did we really just…
ALB:
Knock out a demon?
PARABEL
Yes.
ALB:
Yes. Good job!
They share a laugh. Then:
PARABEL
We should tip him overboard before he causes any more trouble.
ALB:
I’ll do it. Stay here. I’ll be back in a minute.
PARABEL
Alba… be careful.
CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY—CONTINUOU:
The door opens, and Alba begins dragging Aten-Aben to the back door.
HOLL:
Did it work? Yes!
ALB:
Yes, it did. Thank you, Holly.
HOLL:
It wasn’t just me! Ms Pearcey ordered the flowers, and you gave me the idea to use them, and everybody else helped me gather them up.
ALB:
Help me open the back door.
HOLL:
You’re going to… oh my gosh.
ALB:
Yes I am. And we need to do it fast. If we cross into the Infernal Plane, he’s going to start regaining his strength.
HOLL:
Okay…
Together they open the door. It blows violently open. The wind howls outside.
HOLL:
Oh gosh!
ALB:
Be careful, Holly!
Alba strains to shove the demon out without being pulled out herself.
ATEN-ABE:
(weakly)
It won’t do you any good, you know.
ALB:
What won’t?
ATEN-ABE:
This building is still on course. Even without me, it’s going to fly all the way to the Pits of Qwaytox.
(laughs)
Sorry, Alba. Your sister’s boy is still going to be born in Hell.
ALB:
Maybe. But at least he won’t be raised by you.
She shoves. Aten-Aben screams as he falls.
Then, nothing but the howling wind.
HOLL:
Are you all right, Alba?
ALB:
Better.
I’m going to look after Parabel. Can you head back to the ballroom and tell our guests what’s happening?
HOLL:
Not yet. I’ve got a job to do.
ALB:
What job? Where are you going?
HOLL:
I’m going to turn this carriage house around.
ALB:
You’re what? Holly, no!
Holly launches herself out the door.
She strains and beats the air with her wings.
ALB:
Holly!
HOLL:
It’s okay, Alba. I’ve got this.
She screams fiercely as the storm swirls around her.

The walls groan and crack. The chandelier smashes to the ground. Guests scream.

Is everyone all right? Hold on!
Magnus, what’s happening?
MAGNU:
I don’t know! You guys, it’s like something’s trying to push us off course.
Aaaaa—!
SHOCK CUT TO:
EXT. CARRIAGE HOUS:
HOLL:
Come on! You can’t—fight—the Queen of the Wind!
The boards she’s hanging onto crack and fall away. Holly careens off into the night sky, screaming.
FADE OUT.
INT. BALLROO:
The carriage house is still in flight, but no longer being buffeted by turbulence.
MAGNU:
So, how’s it looking, boss?
ALB:
It’s definitely some kind of Qwaytoxian magic. Your body is being pulled toward… our destination, whatever that is. If I had my magic, I might be able to dispel it.
MAGNU:
Yeah. Demons kinda suck, you know?
For a minute there, it was like something was fighting me, trying to push us back. It was like we flew into a hurricane.
ALB:
Yes.
MAGNU:
And then it just stopped.
ALB:
Yes.
MAGNU:
Was that Holly?
ALB:
It was.
MAGNU:
Aw… dammit.
I hope she’s okay. I mean, she’s a crazy fairy who eats too many weird mushrooms, but she’s just a better… everything than me, you know?
ALB:
I know.
MAGNU:
That’s where you’re supposed to say, “No, no, you’re brilliant, Magnus.”
ALB:
(chuckles softly)
You’re getting there.
You always had great potential.
MAGNU:
(snickers)
So much for that, eh?
The sky’s starting to get red.
ALB:
Yes. We’re getting near the convergence.
MAGNU:
Oh boy. They basically eat humans, don’t they?
ALB:
It’s not going to be a warm welcome.
MAGNU:
Aw, man.
The door opens.
HOLL:
(out of breath)
I made it. Is everybody okay?
ALBA AND MAGNU:
Holly!
HOLL:
I’m sorry. I couldn’t turn the building around. The demon magic is too strong. I’m sorry, Alba.
ALB:
You did what you could.
MAGNU:
So… I got a question for you, Holly.
HOLL:
What.
MAGNU:
Listen. Do you think, if the building wasn’t flying… do you think you could carry it? Or bring it down safe, at least?
HOLL:
You mean…
MAGNU:
Like… if I wasn’t here.
ALB:
Magnus.
HOLL:
I think I could probably land the building, but…
MAGNU:
Okay. Good.
HOLL:
But what about you, though? Where are you going?
MAGNU:
Well, see, this beam I’m stuck to? The bricks around it are starting to fall apart. A couple good kicks and it’ll probably come loose.
ALB:
That makes sense. It would have been easier for Aten-Aben to attach you to a beam than a whole building made of different materials.
HOLL:
But… but then you’ll be flying off to Hell. By yourself.
MAGNU:
Better than all of us.
ALB:
I’ll grant you that.
HOLL:
Magnus, you can’t!
MAGNU:
Hey, we gotta do something. I figure it’s gonna get pretty hot in here soon.
HOLL:
It’s going to be so quiet around the House of Healing, you know…
MAGNU:
Aw, you guys will be too busy to notice. And hey, you got Minister Pearcey now. She’s a laugh a minute.
HOLL:
Because I know we fight and get on each other’s nerves a lot, but now and then…
MAGNU:
Yeah. We do okay. We do good in the world. The team that heals together, right?
HOLL:
Right.
Silence.
MAGNU:
So, Alba. Go ahead, say it.
ALB:
Say what?
MAGNU:
“Go to hell, Magnus.”
ALB:
(laughs)
You’re a better person than I was at your age.
MAGNU:
Whoa! Was that praise? I’m not dreaming, am I?
ALB:
All right. There’s not much time left.
MAGNU:
(deep breaths)
Okay. Okay. I… I can do this. I’m gonna—
Holly seizes him in a hug.
MAGNU:
Holly! Geez!
HOLL:
I’m not crying. You’re crying, like a… like a dumb human boy.
MAGNU:
Yeah, that’s me.
ALB:
Take care of yourself down there. We’ll find a way to get you back.
MAGNU:
I’ll be fine. I’m always good. I mean hey, I’ve fought with bandits, and dragons… and I got trapped in Limbo once by an angry goddess, and I managed to get out of there! Hell is gonna be a piece of cake.
ALB:
…Limbo?
MAGNU:
Yeah. Long story. Tell you later.
(to the room)
Okay. Everybody hold on tight! We’re gonna try a thing here.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE NIGHT SK:
Over the wind, we hear a cracking, crunching sound as bricks give way.
MAGNU:
Oh gods!
Another crunch. Broken bricks tumble away.
MAGNU:
Oh geez!
With a twisting, wrenching sound, the beam tears loose and soars past us at an unbelievable speed, carrying a screaming Magnus with it into the distance.
At the same time, the wind begins to whip up into a tornado. We close in on Holly, groaning with effort as she beats her wings furiously.
Finally, there’s a cracking, crashing noise as the carriage house hits the ground.
FADE OUT.
INT. BALLROO:
Gasps and groans.
HOLL:
(nearly fainting from exhaustion)
Did it work? Did we stop in time?
ALB:
It worked. I don’t think we crossed over.
HOLL:
Yay.
Is the Queen all right?
ALB:
Let’s hope so.
PEARCE:
Everyone. We should make our way outside.
ALB:
Oh dear, that’s a nasty cut.
PEARCE:
If you are able, please help out anyone nearby who needs it. And watch out for debris.
ALB:
Keep the pressure on it. I’ll come back around.
Outside, morning birds chirp.
LORD JONEWOO:
I say, is this Hell?
LADY JONEWOO:
I don’t think they have birds in Hell, dearest.
LORD JONEWOO:
Oh, I didn’t realize you’d been.
LADY JONEWOO:
I haven’t!
Not yet.
GUNTHE:
My fellow Farlorians, I have good news.
Queen Parabel and her new baby are alive and well.
A cheer goes up.
GUNTHE:
I’m afraid we don’t have a name yet. He arrived a little earlier than planned, but he’s certainly a good size.
From inside comes a clap of thunder and the sound of the baby giggling.
PARABEL
(from inside)
Now, stop that!
GUNTHE:
And quite… vigorous.
It’s probably safest if nobody goes back there.
PEARCE:
(near exhaustion)
Mister Preston, can you please check the guest list and see who’s unaccounted for? Is the way to the kitchen safe? Hopefully some food survived the trip.
ALB:
Minister, you’ve been on your feet all night. Get some rest.
PEARCE:
But things need to be organized. And we’ll have to find some way to get a message back to Grandville, too…
Oh, goodness. Loria.
ALB:
Antalia Pearcey, have a seat. Doctor’s orders.
PEARCE:
Yes, Alba. Perhaps I’ll just… lie down for a minute.
What about you?
ALB:
Never mind me.
She begins to circulate among the guests outside.
ALB:
Lady Crannion… oh no, that’s broken, isn’t it. Hold it steady—sir, could you look for some cloth and something to use for a splint? I’m going to go and check on Her Majesty and her little one.
Another giggle. More thunder.
ALB:
Wish me luck.
GUNTHE:
Well then! I suppose the next question is… does anyone know where we are?

TAG: HOLLY DEPART:
Birds chirp in the background.
ALB:
I just wish there was more I could do.
HOLL:
Alba. You’re doing so much already.
ALB:
I know.
HOLL:
You just work on getting your magic back. Magnus and I will be back before you know it. I’m sure I’ll meet some helpful people along the way!
ALB:
In Hell.
HOLL:
There are nice people everywhere if you look hard enough.
ALB:
Good luck, Holly.
HOLL:
You too. I hope you find your sister!

(chuckles)
Oh, don’t remind me.

Bye Alba.
Music swells as she takes to the air.

I’m on my way, Magnus!"
