Griffin: Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy, your Dungeon Master, your best friend, and... a third thing that I will think of, later, at the commercial break.
Griffin: Uh, thank you all for listening to The Adventure Zone, this is gonna be a special episode because uh Travis and Teresa had a baby and we are so happy for them! Teresa and the baby are both doing very well, um, and so what you’re about to hear is one of three episodes that we have ready for our sort of... group paternal leave, because my wife Rachel and I, we’re expecting a baby also in early December.
Griffin: So we are going to put out this episode now, I’m so excited for you to hear it, it is our Boston live show, uh, that we did at the Wilbur Theater. It was a sold out crowd, and it was one of the best nights of my whole life. Everybody there was so, so so spectacular and I was really happy with how the story turned out. My hope is that the next episode you hear, which is gonna go up on November 17th, will be the second episode in The Suffering Game arc that we just started. Man, that title is so…. It’s so brutal to say. But that is my hope.
Griffin: And then, uh, once I am also a papa, we will have two more episodes ready for you that I am also so excited to get to. But this just had to be the first one that we put out for this parental leave block, because I can’t not— you can’t not have heard it anymore. It’s too important. I think you’re really gonna enjoy it and like I said, [theme music begins to fade in] the next episode should be a regular one if things calm down a bit and we have some time to put some play time on the books. But for now, enjoy the Boston Live Stunt Spectacular.
[THEME MUSIC: ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson rises to full volume; a cheering crowd can be heard and overtakes the music almost entirely.]
Griffin: You guys know we’re just gonna play Dungeons & Dragons, right?
[The boys laugh and the crowd laughs/screams.]
Clint: Alright. You’ve heard the show, right?
Griffin: You guys, um,
Justin: That was the loudest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life. [crosstalk, the crowd laughs]
Griffin: Uh, these costumes are wonderful, and thank you boys for the hard work that went into them. I did— this is a fun story— just have to help Dad change into his costume backstage [the crowd laughs] which was a horrifying look into the future. [the crowd cheers and claps] There’s actually a small, a smaller person in there that’s controlling the arm for Dad, it’s like a—
Travis: Please be careful of Justin’s drink with your giant wooden hand, Dad.
Clint: Oh my god.
Justin: If it touches me I’m burning this fucker down.
Travis: Is there anyone here who has not ever listened to the show?
Justin: Son of a bitch, stop it. (probably directed at Clint)
[a few isolated cheers from the crowd in response to Travis’s question]
Travis: You’re gonna be so confused! [crowd laughter]
Justin: Okay, time out. We need to take a vote. This is gonna be untenable. [crowd laughter]
Travis: Yeah, you’re gonna need to remo— oh can you even remove it, is it strapped underneath your cloak?
Griffin: It’s strapped on underneath the clothes. [crowd laughter]
Justin: Okay, listen, while Dad deals with that—
Griffin: So, um, there are a few people here who haven’t listened, we play Dungeons & Dragons, and well they play it, I run the game, do you guys wanna talk a little bit about your characters?
[crowd cheers]
Justin: I thought that’s why we had the thing with the... [presumably this video or one like it was played at the venue.]
Griffin: Yeah, that’s a good point.
Justin: The thing— My name is Justin McElroy, I play Taako, he— [interrupted by crowd cheering enthusiastically] Thank you. Thank you. It’s a collaborative creation. And uh, he’s a wizard, and, I dunno, he’s down for whatever. [crowd laughter] Well, unless it’s dangerous, in which case ‘Taako’s good out here.’ [crowd laughter]
Clint: And my name is Clint McElroy, and [crowd cheering] Are you just gonna keep interrupting with these outbursts?? [Griffin laughs, small cheer from the crowd] ‘Cause it’s cool! [crowd cheers] Yeah, do that!
Travis: We’ve got all night.
Clint: We’ve got all night! I play, uh, Merle Highchurch [crowd cheers] who is a… Uh…
Griffin: Cleric— [crowd laughs]
Clint: An elf…
Travis: Nope!
Griffin: It’s funny, because it’s so true.
Clint: Dwarf.
Travis: Yup.
Clint: He’s a dwarf…
Travis: Don’t help him! [crowd laughs] He can— he has to do this on his own.
Clint: A pr— uh, uh, cleric— [small crowd cheers]
Travis: Yup. He does clerical work.
Clint: He likes long walks on the beach,
Griffin: Okay, Travis, what do you do?
Travis: And I am Travis McElroy, [crowd cheers] and I play Magnus Burnsides the fighter. [crowd cheer] He is—
Clint: The Hammer!
Travis: The Hammer, he is known as The Hammer in some small circles. [crowd laugh] Um, he is a human,
Griffin: Yeah, humanity! Yes, that’s us!
Travis: Anyone else here human?! [crowd cheer] Uh, he has a pet goldfish named Steven who is alive and well, [crowd cheer] uh, and he pulls robots’ arms off.
Griffin: Hey, let’s uh—
Clint: That’s a hobby.
Justin: Uh, would it be possible for us to get a little bit more monitor on the stage?
Griffin: Yeah, I’m having a bit of a hard time hearing my— my family.
Justin: They real horny for this one and uh, it’s hard— [crowd cheers]
Travis: They were way hornier than we anticipated.
Justin: So if we could hear ourselves a little bit louder that would be amazing, thank you.
Clint: And that’s Griffin McElroy!
Griffin: Hi! [crowd cheers] [in a dudebro voice] And I— I play the part of Douglas and he’s a gnome thief. Let’s get started.
Justin: Hell yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: Wait, can, Travis, can you hand me my assistant Courvoisier.
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: And, uh, ginger ale?
Griffin: Travis just brought a big box of beverages out here. [crowd cheers]
Clint: IT’S A PROP! It’s not real!
Griffin: Yeah, that’s a magic podcast potion.
Justin: That’s how the magic happens. [crowd laughs]
Clint: God.
Justin: I’m gonna keep this down here so I don’t block line of sight cause we’re gonna do— if this is an indication of the level of, this Courvoisier is any indication, we’re about to do some connection, you and I.
Griffin: So uh, this is gonna be a little—
Clint: Lord!
Justin: Oh yeah!
Griffin: Oh yeah, Travis, tell them what that is. [crowd cheering]
Clint: Isaac, your Love Boat bartender, ladies and gentlemen!
Justin: I don’t know if you can see,
Clint: Holy shit!
Griffin: Yeah, just make sure you build a wall so nobody can see you—
Justin: And Dad’s got a Diet Coke. Can you show ‘em the one bottle, that Andy made—
Travis: Oh yeah, this is uh, from Columbia Brewing,
Justin: Andy, are you here, Andy?
Travis: From Andy, this is the Burnsides Brew Smithery Magnus BurnCider. That was made for us for this show. [crowd cheering]
Clint: [laughs] Patent pending.
Griffin: It says it’s, uh, it says it’s an 18% alcohol content but really it’s just five.
[Travis laughs uproariously, along with the crowd.]
Travis: Ha ha ha ha HA! That was really good!
Clint: That was funny!
Justin: Oh yeah.
Griffin: ‘Cause you fuckin’ cheat all the time. [crowd laughs] All right. So this is gonna be a sidequest, this is not in the current arc that we are currently exploring, and uh, let’s get going.
So Merle, Magnus and Taako, you all find yourselves in the bustling metropolis of Neverwinter. It’s early spring, I think this would probably come right after Crystal Kingdom, right before The Eleventh Hour which we’re in right now, so it’s early spring and I guess that means it was just late fall? ‘Cause they just skip winter entirely? Hi, Travis. Oh, thank you for the beverage. [crowd laughs] Um, and you’ve been summoned to Neverwinter by a letter you received a couple of weeks after the whole Crystal Kingdom debacle. And the letter was sent to you by a name that you recognized, but it was one that you hadn’t heard or really thought of in months.
Clint: And it starts off, ‘Dear Casey,’...
[Griffin laughs]
Justin: Something we can— a reference we can all enjoy.
Travis: So topical!
Clint: Six or seven got it.
Justin: Where my sectagenarians at?!? [crowd cheering, laughing]
Griffin: No, the uh, the letter was actually sent to you by one Jess the Beheader.
Justin: Ohhh. [crowd cheers]
Griffin: Who you befriended on the— let’s see if Dad can even, do you remember?
Travis: Oh yeah!
Clint: Yeah, I remember him. He uh, [crowd laughs]
Griffin: No, wrong. Uh, Jess the Beheader wrote you a letter. Oh, that’s fun. And says,
Clint: Couldn’t work out better.
Griffin: Great. Oh boy, this is gonna be a long night, folks.
Travis: This is top-notch humor. You’re not gonna get this rhyming jokes anywhere else. [Clint chuckles, the crowd laughs]
Griffin: The letter reads:
Jess: Dear Magnus, Tahcko*,
Griffin: And they put the little spelling symbol, like, maybe they spelled it wrong— they did.
Clint: “SP?”
Jess: Dear Magnus, Tahcko*, and... the other one. [audience laughter] How are you? I am fine. Wow, it’s nice to catch up like this. So, I need a favor. I need a big favor. You all really kicked ass on that Rockport Limited mystery and I could use your help solving another murder and if you’re feeling generous I could use some help preventing a second murder.
Travis: Ehh..
Jess: The first murder was Brock Thickstone.
Travis: [laughs] It was on a porn set! [all laugh]
Jess: The first was Brock Thickstone, my BattleFest partner, who was killed in cold blood after our Supreme Champion qualifiers last week. The second is me. It would be very cool to not get murdered. [audience laughs] Brock was killed in cold blood in the locker room here at Chaos Stadium, which is actually a really nice stadium, despite the name, and despite the fact that somebody was recently murdered here.
[Justin and audience laugh]
Jess: His body was found holding a bouquet of flowers— he really liked flowers— that he had received just after our match the night of his death. Neverwinter’s justicars discovered the bouquet had been cursed by powerful magics, although, y’know, that stuff is kind of over my head. If you could come figure out who killed my dude, and keep me safe through the Supreme Champion finals, I’d be happy to split the big ol’ prize pool that comes along with the title. Oh, I guess I need a third favor too. I need a new partner in the ring. Magnus—
Travis: Yeaaahh!
Jess: —you ever tried your hand at prizefighting?
[the crowd cheers]
Travis: Yeaaaahhh!!!!
Jess: Best wishes, Jess.
Griffin: And then in parentheses, “the Beheader.”
Travis: I’ll text her back.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Oh, her!
Travis: U GOT IT smiley face… [crowd laughs]
Griffin: So…
Travis: Thumbs up…
Griffin: I guess you would correspond with—
Travis: Monorail. [audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh, so the three of you took the first cannonball out of the Bureau of Balance headquarters and made a beeline for the Chaos Stadium, which is nestled in the northern outskirts of Neverwinter’s—
Justin: So they’re okay with us just like using…
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: —Company resources like higgledy-piggledy? [audience laugh] Like, if we’re, like, late for a movie,
Taako: Cannonball me, baby!
Griffin: Maybe it’s like that scene in Independence Day where Will Smith steals the helicopter and the guy’s like, “You can’t take the helicopter” and he’s like, “You really wanna shoot ME?” [beat] From Independence Day, you remember that scene? [audience laugh] Uh, I should mention that you shared that cannonball with a special guest, one specifically requested in Jess's letter. “P.S.”, it reads,
Jess: If you’re still in touch with him— just a thought, but could you bring the boy detective too?
Clint: No, no!
Travis: YAAAAAAY! [audience screams and claps]
Clint: No, no, come on!
Travis: Ango!
Clint: I hate the boy detective!
Travis: No you don’t.
Clint: I hate him!
Travis: Noo you don’t.
Justin: What is, uh, how is he reacting to the cannonball? [small audience laugh]
Griffin: Uh, he—
Travis: No, do it in character.
Griffin: He was a champion.
Justin: Of course he was.
Travis: Do the voice.
Griffin: Uh, well, right, that— we’re in medias res right now, but uh—
Travis: No, I thought we were in Neverwinter.
Griffin: Hey, hey. [audience laugh/groan/clap/boo]
Clint: Vocabulary joke!
Travis: I’m drinking it in!
Griffin: Uh, but, uh, uh, you do get a hearty,
Angus: Hello, sirs!
[audience screams]
Griffin: And standing in front of you in front of Chaos Stadium is Angus McDonald, who is a bit winded. The three of you managed to shake him in the busy crowds of the Protector’s Enclave, but he is the world’s greatest detective, so he managed to find you. [audience and Justin laugh]
Angus: Sorry I lost track of you! I looked away for just a second and you were gone! [audience laugh]
Clint: If we kill anybody in this story does it hold for the rest of the—
Griffin: It would be a paradox.
Justin: We’re unkillable, though, right?
Griffin: Essentially, yeah.
Justin: Okay, awesome.
Travis: YEAH!!!
Justin: Should be good. NO REPERCUSSIONS!! [audience laugh]
Angus: I’m glad that I managed to find you, I was worried that I was not gonna be included on this adventure.
Clint: (under his breath) Oh, shit.
Justin: Despite our best fuckin’ efforts.
Travis: I wanna point out that Justin did that in Justin voice, not Taako voice, so that’s not canon.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah, you guys are being really sweet to Angus. Um.
Justin: For a change.
Griffin: I should also mention that today is Angus’s birthday. [audience cheers]
Travis: Awwww.
Griffin: Which is probably how you were convinced to bring him along in the first place. You probably, like, tore off that part of the letter and were like ‘I dunno man, [Justin and audience laugh] she didn’t mention you, I’m sorry.’
Travis: I feel like Magnus got him something. Like maybe a carved wooden duck?
Griffin: Okay. [audience laugh] So maybe that’s, like, all you can actually make?
Travis: It might just be what he’s really good at. It’s not like, limited, but he knows his strengths.
Justin: Get him a carved wooden stag. That would be—
Travis: I give him a carved wooden stag, sure.
Justin: [holding back laughter at his own goof] The little girl that got one on Game of Thrones, that worked out good for them. [Audience cries out/laughs/claps] That’s a different fantasy thing..
Griffin: Yeah… uh, so uh, the four of you are standing in front of Chaos Stadium, and the crowd is rambunctious. The, the BattleFest [some yelling from audience] Yeah, okay, a little bit of Foley work from the audience? [slightly more yelling] That was maybe the least rambunctious crowd I’ve ever heard? [audience laugh]
Travis: Yeah. Oh, we didn’t pick a, we didn’t pick a scrivener.
Griffin: Oh, that’s right. We’ll be fine.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Last time we did this, we’ve only done one live Adventure Zone by the way so there might be some rough edges—
Clint: That’ll show you how good it was.
Justin: Yeah, that was in front of 125 people who, frankly, didn’t seem to wanna be there very much. [audience laugh]
Audience member: [distant, very quiet] You always remember your first time!
Griffin: Yeah, that is true.
Travis: It’s not a back and forth kind of thing.
Justin: Yeah, it’s kind of a one— [audience cheers and claps]
Clint: It’s D&D but it’s not that interactive.
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: So, uh, the, the BattleFest Supreme Champion Finals are about to take place, and the scene I’m trying to set is Wrestlemania.
Travis: Got it. [audience cheer]
Griffin: That’s the picture I want you to lock in your mind. The crowd here is rambunctious, it seems like there’s far too many people here to fit into any one building, and every single person in the crowd seems as rowdy as any ten non-BattleFest-attendees combined. Everywhere you look are cosplayers—
Audience member: [audible] Yeah!
Griffin: —dressed up in the spandex regalia of famous fighters. Some of those fighters are featured on those large banners which are draped across the walls of the building. The building looks like a very old building that has been sort of repurposed for this? Like there are these tall stone columns, it looks very ancient, for lack of a better term. Uh, yeah, and people are cosplaying, there are some signs, so many signs.
Jess’s name is all over the place, a third of the signs here say ‘Off with their heads!’ in big block letters, there’s, a few have an image of a crescent moon with the words ‘Unleash the Beast’ on them, some are for a fighter named Queen Sabine, and a few, mostly in the hands of some smaller kids, who are wearing angel wings, are championing a fighter named Jeff Angel [audience and Clint laugh], and then there are signs for like the die-hard BattleFest fans who you’ve probably never heard of before. Although I should ask you— the BattleFest franchise, which is the WWE, essentially, has been around in this world for about a decade or so.
Travis: Uh-huh.
Griffin: Do you guys think your characters have any— are you guys weirdly secret, like, die-hard wrestling fans?
Travis: I think Magnus probably is aware of it, maybe not die-hard, but definitely, like, knows of it.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: That’s the least committal answer ever.
Griffin: Yeah, Jesus.
Travis: Yeah, ‘I am aware.’
Clint: Merle knows all the wrestlers from thirty years ago.
Griffin: Okay. [audience laughter]
Travis: Before they went pro.
Clint: Yeah.
Travis: It was still back-alley wrestling.
Clint: Like Dusty Rhodes, the American… well, it wouldn’t be— Rusty Dodes, the American Dream. [audience laugh]
Justin: Which is a shame, because Dusty Rhodes is a much better fantasy wrestler name.
Clint: It is, true, yeah.
Griffin: What about Taako?
Justin: Taako is only familiar with the television show, because ‘Sizzle it Up with Taako,’ his cooking show, was on up against them on basic cable. Basic fantasy, fantasy cable,
Griffin: Which literally means that these two live events were taking place at the same time in different places in the world.
Justin: Right.
Griffin: Wonderful. [small audience laugh]
Justin: ‘Cause television does not exist, you’ve made very clear to me.
Griffin: But you make your way through the crowd and into this, this uh, ancient-looking building, you’re whisked inside the stage door by a producer who finds your name on a guest list, and inside you see a familiar face, you see Jess the Beheader.
Magnus: Jess!!
Merle: The Beheader!
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Clint: Middle and last names.
Griffin: She says,
Jess: Ey, long time no see! What, whaddya guys been up to since all the train murder stuff?
Magnus: More murder! [he and audience laugh]
Merle: Yeah, death, destruction, the usual.
Travis: Character voices.
Justin: Character fuckin’ VOICES! [audience laugh]
Merle: [in his character voice] Death and destruction, the usual!
[audience laugh, cheer]
Griffin: You—
Clint: That’s the one I picked.
Jess: You sounded more Scottish last time I saw you. [audience laugh]
Merle: [bad Scottish accent] Death an’ destrrrruction, the usual!
Travis: He’s a different actor this time.
Jess: You sounded less Scottish. [audience laugh]
Griffin: Uh, Jess is accompanied by a human man, uh, named Derek Humanman [Clint laughs] No, uh, she is accompanied by a human man who doesn’t really have the build of a professional fighter. He is wearing a button-up shirt tucked into some nerdy slacks. He’s got a big pair of round glasses on, he’s got a big bushy beard, and an almost perfectly round belly, and I’m reading that now and I realize that made it sound like he’s Santa Claus, but he’s not. [audience laugh]
Clint: Does it shake when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly?
Griffin: [laughs] Uh, no, it doesn’t.
Justin: [laughing] Well, that’s how you tell them apart! [audience and boys laugh]
Travis: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Justin: You ever see ‘em fighting and you need to tranq one, [laughter] have ‘em laugh!
Travis: ‘Now YOU laugh.’
Justin: ‘Now you laugh! Okay, now you!’ [laughter] ‘He’s the clone!’ [laughter]
Travis: ‘No, watch! It jiggles! Aaaah!’
Justin: ‘No, watch it jiggle!’ s’DOOF [tranquilizer dart sound effect] [all laugh] I’m sorry, first row! [laugh] You will get wet— you may get drenched. Sorry.
Audience member: [audible among laughter] Woo!
Griffin: Uh, so while you all are catching up with Jess, this guy kinda [throat-clearing noise]
Travis: What was his name? You didn’t say his name.
Justin: Just wait, just to be clear, Je— the person accompanying Jess is named Jeff?
Griffin: No.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: It’s cool.
Justin: Derek.
Griffin: You haven’t asked his name yet, which is sort of a fun running theme.
Justin: Yeah, lemme try. [audience laugh]
Griffin: He clears his throat to kinda like make his presence known and, looks at his watch.
Justin: Oh.
Taako: Hey, what’s your handle, kemosabe?
[audience laugh]
Nervous-sounding Man: Uhh, oh, hey there, sorry, I’m— I’m Merrick, uh, I’m the CEO here, I uh, Jess told me that you guys were coming, and uh, it’s really nice to meet you, but uh, um, I need you to sign this before you go backstage.
Griffin: And he hands all three of you clipboards with some stuff on it.
Taako: Sure, sure. Uh, how have the ratings been this year?
Merrick: Oh, real good, we’ve got some really um uh really savage events, it’s been really cool—
Taako: Better recently, probably?
Merrick: Yeah, uh, I would say.
Merle: You got rid of that damn cooking show for competition.
Taako: Yeah, less competition.
Merrick: Yeah, about five years ago we had a, a big upswing and it’s been a nice—
Taako: Yeahh, you’re welcome for that.
Merrick: Yeah, sign this for me? [audience laugh] Your standard talent release, NDA, merchandising, licensing deal, [unintelligible]
Magnus: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don’t comfortably give up merchandising.
Travis: [beat] That’s a weird thing that you’ll all learn about Magnus in the NEXT story arc.
Justin: By the way, after the show there’ll be posters out in the lobby. Make sure you...
Clint: Posters.
Griffin: No that’s true though, there are wonderful, wonderful posters made by Carey Pietsch.
Justin: Wonderful posters.
Travis: There will be posters, the best.
Justin: Carey, are you here? [cheering from audience]
Travis: Carey’s here! [cheering]
Justin: Where are you, Carey?
Clint: You’re not gonna see her no matter where she’s sitting!
Griffin: Yeah, you can’t see anybody past the first two rows. Uh, he looks at you, waiting for you to sign the...
Travis: Oh, yeah, uh, I sign it.
Merrick: Okay, thank you.
Griffin: [beat] 15 years in the future, he opens up a Magnus Park.
Travis: Damn it! [Clint laughs]
Griffin: He makes 60 million gold pieces.
Travis: My IP!!!
Griffin: He takes it back,
Merrick: Thank you, thank you. Hey, uh, you, little boy. Little boy. Are you a Jeff Angel fan??
Griffin: And he fishes out a little, uh,
Magnus: Please don’t talk to our little boy.
Merle: He’s OUR little boy.
Taako: Bought him fair and square.
Griffin: He fishes out a little angel wing button from his nerdy khakis and he hands it out to Angus, and Angus says,
Angus: Oh, heck no, sir! I’m no chump mark!
[audience laughter]
Griffin: And he takes it back.
Travis: And I high-five Angus.
Griffin: He says,
Merrick: Oh, sorry, sorry kiddo. Welp, [beat] off to business! Business, business time for me!
And he turns and leaves. And Jess says,
Jess: Okay, here are the rules. BattleFest Supreme Champion Title—
Magnus: How many holds are barred?
Jess: None of the bars.
Magnus: WHOOOOA.
Jess: And none of the holds. None of the bars. [beat] Uh, you got one challenger, or two partners— me and you, Magnus— we’re gonna take on four other fighters which were chosen by a fan vote. If the challengers— me and you— get knocked out or submit during the fight, we lose. If we can knock out or force all four of our opponents to submit, we get to be Supreme Champion. You got it?
Magnus: Yes.
Jess: Uhh,
Magnus: Where do I need to like, sign up for my wrestling name?
Jess: We’ll figure that out backstage—
Magnus: I’ve already got it.
Jess: Okay. [audience laugh] Sit on that plot point for a—
Magnus: THEY CALL ME… i'Morko!
Jess: ...What is that?
Magnus: It’s Elvish for ‘The Bear’. And I pull out my bear mask from the, uh, the Petals to the Metal—
Griffin: Oh yeah. [audience cheer]
Magnus: And I put it back on.
Griffin: I like that. [audience claps]
Clint: And he pulls out his dork mask and puts it on over the bear mask.
Griffin: [laughs] Fucking—
Travis: Listen, ELVISH IS NOT DORKY, DAD! [Clint laughs]
Griffin: That was totally, that had to be in-fiction you saying ‘Elvish is not dorky, Dad’ to Merle. [Justin giggling, audience cheers]
Clint: [doing a voice] ‘And get out of my room!’
Travis: [doing a voice] ‘Leave me alone, DAD! I’m practicing my Elvish!’ [laughter]
Griffin: Jess says, uh,
Jess: Magnus, I picked you ‘cause I liked your moves on the Rockport Limited. [boys laugh] And your body type is pretty similar to my last partner, whose name was Brock Thickstone.
Magnus: No, yeah. I remember.
Jess: But Merle and Taako, I have jobs for you too. Merle, if you’re willing, we could use a manager in our corner.
Merle: [not in chara voice] Oh! Yeah.
Jess: We could use, you know, a hype man, somebody there to work the crowd, get ‘em on our side, but you could also support us from outside the ring if you’re able. Taako—
Clint: I have experience. I was in the JCs.
Justin: Uh, she didn’t hear any of that because you didn’t say it in a character voice. [audience laughter] [raises voice] These people paid MONEY to watch us sit here and play D&D, the least we could fuckin’ do is some CHARACTER VOICES!
Clint: [yells] FINE!!! [crowd cheers]
Justin: I’m sorry. By the way.
Clint: It’s all right.
Audience member: We still love you, Merle!
Clint: Aw, no.
Justin: Again, kind of a one-way… just… [audience laugh]
Clint: It’s, yeah.
Justin: Unidirectional…
Clint: Maybe just a physical thing…
Justin: Especially if you’re encouraging my DAD, I’m gonna need you to sit on it. Okay? Thank you. [audience laugh]
Griffin: She says,
Jess: Taako, your job is the most important job of all.
Taako: Go on.
Magnus: You need to make sure no one sits in this chair…
Clint: Was that a— that was a character voice?
Justin: Two words, that’s how we do. Go ahead.
Taako: Go on.
Jess: I need you on the catwalks up above keeping an eye on the fight, keeping an eye out for suspicious individuals.
Taako: On the catwalk?
Jess: Yeah.
Taako: Yeah, on the catwalk? Okay.
Jess: Uh,
Taako: Should I… [audience and boys laugh, Justin snickers] Should I shake my little tush ON the catwalk? [audience cheers] You know what, I know we’re having fun here, Right Said Fred did have some other really good singles you should look into. If you have a few minutes later, I’ll hook you up, I’ve got some tapes.
Jess: [beat] I am regretting how I have assigned the most important job. [all laugh]
Taako: Naw, I’m ready.
Jess: There is no doubt in my mind that Brock’s death was the result of foul play. I don’t know who’s responsible but I figure whoever they are probably wants me dead too. I need you up there watching my back.
Taako: Sure, yeah, okay. No problem.
Jess: Cool. Let’s get you all backstage.
Griffin: Um, and you’re backstage.
Travis: [woo-woo-woo noises]
Clint: The magic of podcasting.
Griffin: Um, and it’s really quiet backstage. There are four private dressing rooms that are all shut and there are security personnel in front of all of them, keeping them secret from you.
Travis: Do the security personnel look trustworthy?
Griffin: Yes..? [audience laugh]
Travis: Would that be some kind of check I would do? Trustworthiness check?
Griffin: Sure, uh, it’s, wow, we’re actually rolling dice and it’s been 21 minutes. [audience cheers] Uh,
Clint: Do you have a proficiency in trustworthiness?
Griffin: No, it’s not called trustworthiness, it’s callllled….
Travis: Insight?
Griffin: Insight, yes.
Travis: That’s a 14.
Clint: Oh my god, it really is! [audience laugh]
Griffin: No, they seem cool.
Travis: They seem cool, okay.
Justin: I’m impressed.
Griffin: Angus, Angus goes over to check out Brock’s locker, start digging through his belongings—
Travis: His Brocker?
Griffin: —his Brocker, looking for clues. Off to one side of this room is another dressing area, there’s a row of mirrors surrounded by lights, and over by a big tall wardrobe is an even taller Goliath man who has pitch-black hair and a sharp little goatee, and he’s wearing a spectacular tuxedo and uh, he looks at all of you as you walk in the room, and Jess says,
Jess: Dante, these are them.
Griffin: And he looks at you and just kinda considers you for a second. And he says, uh. [clears throat] [beat] [all the boys burst into laughter]
Clint: Let me give you a little insight, let me pull aside the curtain. Right now Griffin is running through the database of voices in his head trying to figure out, ‘Which one have I not used yet?’
Griffin: Uh, no, I got it. He looks at you and he says:
Dante: [in a very deep voice] No.
Griffin: And Jess says,
Jess: Dante, come on!
Griffin: And he says,
Dante: Let me see.
Griffin: He looks at you, Magnus, and he says
Dante: I’m sorry. [audience laugh] You have a wonderful body.
[audience laugh]}}
Magnus: Thank you!
Dante: But you do not have the soul of a champion.
Travis: I punch him in the face. [audience and Justin laugh]
Griffin: Roll that.
Travis: That’s an 18!
Griffin: Oh my god!
Travis: 18 plus 8, a 26.
Griffin: You— okay, here it is. This is the scene. He says,
Dante: You have a beautiful body, but you do not have the soul of a champion.
[Justin and Travis laughing throughout]
Griffin: And you just, before he finishes you just Pop! And it’s literally just like, his face doesn’t move at all and he goes,
Dante: Interesting.
[audience and brothers laugh]
Griffin: He picks up some glasses from the table and puts them on his gigantic face and he just says,
Dante: What does it mean to you to be Supreme Champion?
Magnus: It means being strong enough to make the weak feel safe.
Merle: Oh, god. [Griffin and audience laugh, audience cheers]
Griffin: He says,
Dante: What about your friends? Can they vouch for you?
Magnus: One of them probably will. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: He turns to you, Taako and Merle, and says
Dante: Is this good-bodied individual Supreme Champion material? What has he done in the past that has been Champion-like?
Clint: Um…
Griffin: By the way, this voice was starting out supposed to be kind of Andre the Giant-esque and then it took a pivot towards fuckin’ Droopy. [audience laughter]
Clint: Kinda got a little Alfred Hitchcock…
Travis: Yeah, it’s like if Hitchcock and Andre the Giant had a sad baby. [audience laughter]
Griffin: He asked you to vouch for Magnus for his Champion qualities.
[unintelligible from audience]
Justin: Yeahh, it’s kind of a one-way thing.
Merle: [unenthusiastically] Yeah, he’s the best. He’s the best.
Taako: He’s really… he’s strong.
Merle: He has proficiencies.
Taako: Very good at rolling, if that—
Merle: Carves a mean duck.
Taako: Yeah, carves, he’s good at carving stuff. I don’t understand what you’ll need him for, but… yeah.
Dante: I know Champion jealousy when I hear it.
Taako: [unconvincingly] Yeah, that’s what it is, too.
Griffin: He says,
Dante: Okay, I believe you. I will make you—
Griffin: And now he’s Russian.
Justin: He should slow down, we got all night!
Dante: I will make you, uh, what is your character? What will your, What’s your—
Magnus: My name is... i'Morko! The bear—
Dante: Oh, the bear in Elvish. Yes.
Justin: [imitates guitar riff] That’s a sting I have for— Try it again.
Magnus: My name is... i'Morko!
Justin: [imitates guitar riff]
Griffin: Uh, I think he just like has this big table full of fabric and he just throws it up in the air, and just like, like a cartoon, instead of cutting and sewing it—
Travis: I also want to point out I’ve been wearing the bear mask [laughing] this whole time, just like, talking to another grown adult like, “I’m a champion.”
[audience laughs]
Griffin: I think he makes you, sort of, it’s almost maybe, half furry costume, just like the arms and legs. And the audience reaction to that was maybe the best thing I’ve ever heard. [audience cheers] Because it wasn’t like, it was like half “Yeh!” and then the other half “Ahw.” [audience laugh] Just fine, don’t hate. Uh, and, uh, but there’s like a breastplate on it, uh, and, but, furry arms and legs but also like a breastplate on it.
Clint: Are there nipples?
Travis: Good question.
Griffin: There’s eleven nipples.
Clint: Eleven nipples.
Travis: Yeeaahhh!!!
Clint: Feedin’ time.
Griffin: You suit up, and he looks at you two. And he says,
Dante: Hmm. You know, you two have wonderful bodies as well, would you like me to make you all costumes just for funsies?
Magnus: I had to punch you— [irritated noise]
Dante: No, this one’s for funsies. [audience laughs]
Magnus: You guys should do it.
Merle: I’d love a costume because this arm is killin’ me!
Dante: [laughing] Okay, what do you want me to do about— do you want a massage? What’s the....
Justin: Wait a minute, timeout. Does he have it?
Griffin: What? The wooden arm? Yeah, yeah. This is after Crystal Kingdom, you lost that bad boy.
Clint: Aww..
Justin and Griffin: Sorry, Dad.
Travis: It’s not real!
Griffin: Hold on, what would you do? Would you write, like, a letter like ‘Don’t grab that thing that makes you lose your arm!’ And then like seal it and put it in your pocket like Bill and Ted style? [audience laughter]
Clint: It’s up to Trav.
Griffin: Why would it be up to—
Travis: I would do it even if I knew what was going to happen.
[audience wooing]
Griffin: He asked you if guys want—
Travis: I rolled a 16, if that matters.
Griffin: Do you all want wrestling costumes as well, or do you want to go—
Taako: [quietly] Go for it!
Merle: Yeah!
Dante: What are you thinking?
Merle: Um...
Griffin: You’ll actually be, like, you’ll actually be out there, you’ll be ringside, the manager. So it may make sense for Merle to also have a persona.
Merle: Something with, uh, stripes?
Dante: Stripes-man.
Merle: They’re very slimming.
Dante: You just want to be stripes-man?
Merle: [long beat] Yeah!
Travis: For those of you at home, he is nodding.
Clint: Emphatically.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: I think he does the same thing and he just makes you the sleaziest-looking suit you’ve ever seen.
Clint: I like.
Griffin: And like, maybe 12 pounds worth of fake, like, chains, and the suit is pinstriped? And he’s like,
Dante: Uh, I will call you Pinstripe. [audience laugh]
Justin: That’s good.
Clint: How come he gets to pick his name?
Justin: Well you didn’t pick yours!
Dante: Because you didn’t say anything!
Clint: I would— [sputters] Pause!
Griffin: Paws?
Clint: Gimme a pause so I can jump [unintelligible]
Griffin: [sighs] Okay.
Clint: Pinstripe. I like Pinstripe.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s— Fuck. [audience laugh]
Clint: I think it’s very appropriate. And it’s very slimming.
Dante: Magic boy. [audience laughter]
Taako: Magic man. [bigger laugh, Travis cackles] Listen—
Clint: Magic Mike!
Taako: Here’s my character. And this is kind of a meta one, so hang in there. His name is Tuff Greg. Now here’s Tuff Greg’s thing. He’s kinda—
Merle: Is it T-U-F-F?
Taako: Yeah. That’s good. He’s kind of an everyman? And I want his uniform— this is when you’re making it— I want it to look exactly like the crew you have working the show. So the theme of it would be—
[Griffin cackles, audience cheers]
Taako:The theme of it would be like, he just got up there like ‘What’s Tuff Greg doing?’ but otherwise indiscernible from everybody else in the show. Like, you wouldn’t raise an eye no matter where you saw this guy. Tuff Greg. The character of wrestling.
[Griffin cackles again, the audience cheers]
Griffin: I think he says, uh,
Dante: I have the perfect idea of how to accomplish this.
Taako: Impress me.
Griffin: And he just walks over to one of those security guys, who is perfectly Taako-shaped, and just grabs his shirt and pants and pulls, but it doesn’t rip them, just the clothes come off? [Justin and audience laugh]
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: And the security guy’s a pro, so he doesn’t move.
Justin: [laughing] Doesn’t blink an eye.
Griffin: And he just hands them to you, and they are your perfect size.
Taako: Perfect.
Merle: You oughta at least cut the sleeves off, ‘cause that’s, that’s very in.
Taako: No, I want it to be INDISCERNIBLE.
Merle: But then they’re always gonna confuse you with the— aaaaaaah, alright, yeah, okay. Aaaahhh. I see.
Griffin: You guys are all costumed up, and, uh, before the fight begins,
Travis: How do we look?
Griffin: You look fucking ridiculouusssss.
Travis: But in a good way?
Griffin: Yes, sure. Uh, Jess says, uh, before you go out there,
Jess: Oh, one last thing.
Griffin: And she opens up a locker and she says,
Jess: Magnus and Merle, you’re gonna need to put all your weapons in here.
Magnus: Wha...? I’m. Not so good without them. [laughs weakly, the crowd also laughs]
Jess: I know, it’s BattleFest rules though.
Magnus: Mmmm, but not the gloves, right? That’s part of my costuuuuume.
Griffin: The clothes?
Travis: My gloves!
Jess: No, all of it’s….
Merle: I got a tree arm.
Jess: That’s super great. Hey, what happened there, by the way? You had two—
Magnus: We’ll tell you later.
Merle: Son of a bitch cut my arm off. That’s what the hell happened—
Magnus: I SAVED. YOUR GODDAMN LIFE.
Merle: No, you cut it off!
Magnus: By Pan’s name!
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I give Railsplitter a gentle kiss.
Griffin: Okay. [audience laugh]
Travis: And I place it in the—
Clint: That’s the name of your axe, I hope to god.
Travis: And I place it gently in the locker and I say, ‘I’ll be back. Don’t be scared.’ [audience laugh]
Griffin: You hear it go [whimpering noise]
Travis: WHAT???
Griffin: No, I’m just kidding.
Travis: And I hang up, let’s see. Phantom Fist,
Griffin: Yeah, shit.
Clint: This is gonna take all night.
Travis: My rapier, my shortbow— and I’m doing this from memory. And, can I keep the Fletcher’s Mitt? It’s not a weapon.
Jess: No gloves, it’s a no gloves policy too.
Magnus: The Fletcher’s Mitt… do I get to keep my shield?
Jess: Uh, probably not, no.
Audience member: [distant, very quiet] What about Steven?!
Travis: STEVEN’S NOT A WEAPON! [crowd laugh] He is an agent of love. [crowd laugh]
Griffin: I’m gonna move things along. Let’s just say you upload-- you put all your weapons in there.
Travis: Okay, I put everything in there.
Griffin: Taako, you’re allowed to keep your umbrella. And Merle, you’re allowed to keep your bible, your Extreme Teen Bible. It’s not a weapon, it’s a book. And, oh yeah, show everybody your—
Clint: You mean THIS Extreme Teen Bible? [crowd cheers] Also on sale in the lobby after the show.
Griffin: Not true.
Justin: Not true.
Travis: That’s a lie.
Clint: Thank you, pal. You can order ‘em…
Griffin: All right, let’s move forward to BattleFest. I’m gonna split the party up. Yeah, I know. It’s a few minutes ‘til showtime,
Clint: [laughs] Ooooooh.
Griffin: It’s a few minutes ‘til showtime, and Merle and Magnus, you guys are at the top of the entrance ramp behind a curtain. You can hear the crowd, they sound just as rambunctious as they did outside. Taako, Jess has taken you to a service elevator, fulfilling our contractual obligation to have an elevator in this live episode of the show Adventure Zone?
[crowd laughs and cheers]
Griffin: You take the elevator up to the catwalk of Chaos Stadium, and below you can see this sold-out crowd that you’ve been hearing chant backstage for the past hour. There’s easily 20,000 people here all just screaming their brains out.
Merle: What are they chanting?
Justin: So we’re looking at kind of an arena, [crowd cheering] we’re looking at kind of an arena? Calm down, okay, please.
Griffin: Yes, it is an arena, like an indoor....
Justin: So the catwalk would be sorta like a network of.... (unintelligible)
Griffin: Yeah so, the catwalk is actually two long beams that intersect with two other beams going in the other direction—
Clint: How high up is it? Like real, real high?
Griffin: It’s about… no, it’s not that high, it’s about 25 feet up? There’s some lights hanging off of it over the ring. The ring, by the way is a hexagon-shaped? There’s six sides. Six points.
Clint: Can the boy detective go up there too?
Travis: Yeah, what’s Ango doing during all this?
Griffin: No, the boy detective—
Angus: (dejected) I’m sorry sirs, I couldn’t find any good clues. I guess this one’s just out of my hands. (brightly) Anyway, I’m gonna go get a—
Magnus: You looked in the— There was nothing in the locker?
Angus: I’m gonna go get a big pretzel and watch the shooowwwwww ‘cause. [crowd laughs]
Clint: So this is a cameo. Okay.
Angus: It is, uh, my birthday… so…
Magnus: Ango, I am dedicating this fight to you. If I win, you won’t die of some terrible disease. [crowd laughs]
Clint: I give no such reassurance.
Griffin: He says,}
Angus: (dismayed) Am I sick?! [crowd laugh]
Magnus: Not yet. [beat] Give it time.
Griffin: So Taako, you’re up on this catwalk, and you’ve just gone up the elevator.
Justin: Did it, uh, uh….
Griffin: Did it what.
Justin: Are we like- Does the match start?
Griffin: No, not yet.
Justin: Okay. So can I go up to the catwalk, do I have to be up on the catwalk already or can I still be like backstage hanging out?
Griffin: Do you have a fun scene you wanna do? Okay, yeah, no you haven’t [audience laugh] you haven’t gone up yet.
Clint: We don’t rehearse this show ahead of time, so.
Griffin: Yeah, quick retcon.
Justin: This isn’t a fun scene. If, in my outfit,
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: I wanna go to where their weapons are being stored.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And I am going to… What’s the situation with the place where, are they locked up, or what’s up?
Griffin: Yeah, they’re locked up in Jess's locker. You guys are, let’s say you guys have already gone out the entrance ramp so you’re not really in the locker room anymore. You still are. You guys are….
Clint: Did we only check our weapons or did we keep all our other stuff?
Griffin: You kept your Bible and your pants or whatever.
Clint: Did I keep Nitpicker?
Griffin: You did, but you’re not with Taako. We’re getting hung up, quick! Quick, do something, do something!
Justin: Yeah, I wanna, so I’m gonna open her locker—
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: With Knock.
Griffin: Okay. Bing!
Justin: Uhh, and then…
Griffin: Is that what you do?
Justin: Mmh?
Clint: Is that the sound it makes?
Justin: At home? Uh, no, I’m gonna cast Leomund’s Secret Chest? Which lets, creates ‘an exquisite chest’ that I can hide on the Ethereal Plane.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: [slightly hysterical] Does it say the word exquisite on your card??
Justin: Yes. [Travis and crowd laugh]
Griffin: All of Taako’s spells are exquisite.
Justin: On MY cards it says exquisite.
Clint: Yes. And you always roll 20s.
Travis: I love that.
Justin: Yeah. Yeah, so I throw everything into the exquisite chest and stuff it into the Ethereal Plane.
Griffin: Okay. And what do you do with the chest?
Justin: You’ll find out.
Griffin: Okay, cool. [audience laugh]
Clint: Foreshadowing.
Griffin: All right, let’s fast-forward back to where we were. You’re up on the catwalk, you can see this crowd below, you’re about 25 feet up from the ring, and over this series of… it’s like a hashtag shape, like two and two intersecting?
Justin: Gotcha.
Griffin: Don’t laugh at me making a hashtag shape with my hands. [audience laughs louder] I was very vulnerable…
Clint: By the way, that’s “hashtag HashtagShape”. [audience laugh]
Griffin: I was very vulnerable in that moment. Um, and as you come up the elevator, you see a young human man, who is operating a spotlight, but he hasn’t heard you over the roar of the crowd. He is shining his light onto an MC [ Master Of Ceremonies , Announcer ] who slides through the ropes of the ring and walks to the middle of the stage and grabs a hanging microphone that’s being slowly lowered down by this spotlight boy.
Griffin: Merle and Magnus, you are on the entrance ramp with Jess behind a thick curtain that’s kind of muffling the emcee as he gives the three of you your grand introduction, and Jess says,
Jess: Anything else you two need to know before we get out there?
Merle: What’s our entrance music?
Magnus: Yeah, like, what are we doing?
Jess: Well, you guys can just come out to mine, we’ve got the—
Magnus: Okay.
Merle: Ohh...
Magnus: Who are we facing? Are there any weaknesses, or?
Jess: No, that’s the whole thing, we don’t know. That’s the whole thing, it’s a secret fan vote.
Magnus: Cool, cool.
Jess: Oh, I thought of something.
Magnus: Yeah?
Griffin: She says,
Jess: We’re heels. [beat] Do you know what that means?
[audience begins to laugh]
Magnus: No, what?
Merle: We make people feel better?
Griffin: She says,
Jess: Something like that.
Griffin: —and then pushes the two of you through the curtain onto the top of the ramp.
Griffin: And for a second,
Magnus: Wait, hold on, does that mean we’re jerks?
Griffin: And for a second, when you walk out to the ramp and the spotlight is on you and this music is playing, the spotlight is shining on the three of you, there’s silence, and then there is a deafening wave of boos.
Travis: Yeah!
[audience boos loudly]
Justin: There we go.
Griffin: And Jess is just -
Clint: I don’t think they like that idea, Griffin. [audience laugh]
Griffin: [laughs] Jess is just fucking eating it up. She’s actually- you see now that she has a bunch of paper-mache severed heads that she’s throwing into the audience like, “Yeaaahhh!” [audience laughs and claps]
Clint: We’ll be selling those after the show too.
Travis: I want you to know I, Travis McElroy, love this.
Griffin: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: Magnus Burnsides HATES this. [audience laugh]
Griffin: Yeah, sure. And she holds up her hand in the air and her soulbound axe that she had on the train arc appears in her hand, and she just like buries it in the top of the ramp and, like, runs down to the ring.
Travis: I kind of jog after her like, “Uhhhh,” [audience laugh]
Griffin: Yeah, what are you all doing going down the ramp?
Travis: And I’m kind of doing claw motions with my hands.
Griffin: This is a hostile - [cheers and claps from crowd, presumably Travis was doing the gestures] [big audience laugh]
Clint: I’ll do Fosse hands. I’m doing Fosse hands, jazz hands. Jazz Hands.
Griffin: You’re just gonna Fosse-step the whole way down? (sings) “Hey, I’m Pinstripe -”
Travis: That’s [unintelligible] from Pinstripe!
Clint: Do a little grapevine. Yeah. For you dancers out there.
Griffin: You make your way down to the ring. Taako -
Justin: As they’re entering, I’ve cast Arcane Eye, and am having it hover around the crowd. I can move it up to 30 feet with an action, but since we’re not technically in combat -
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: I just want to have it hovering around, just to give me another set of eyeballs to rely on.
Griffin: Okay, yeah no that’s good. You don’t necessarily see- I mean, everybody’s cosplaying and it’s a crazy wild scene, but you don’t see anybody, like, holding a dark orb and, like, chanting into it. But you do catch the attention of the boy running the spotlight. This is just after they’ve made it to the stage, and they take up a couple minutes just soaking up the boos - well, that sounds bad. [crowd laugh]
Justin: That’s what we did backstage!
Griffin: Yeah. Yeah. And this boy says, uh,
Squeaky-voiced teen: Hey, you’re not supposed to be up here!
Taako: (doing a deep ‘manly’ voice) Hey, it’s me, Greg! [audience laughter and claps]
Squeaky-voiced teen: Well, you’re wearing my clothes, that’s kind of ironclad.
Justin: There’s no way it’s the same guy, I’m not wearing HIS clothes!
Clint: ‘Cause he’d be naked, right?
Justin: ‘Cause he’d be naked!
Squeaky-voiced teen: I meant my uniform! It’s the only clothes I have, so I just call this uniform ‘my clothes’. [audience laugh] It’s not funny, why are you laughing, it’s the only clothes I have! [audience and Justin laugh] Do you have - I’m the only one that’s supposed to be up on the catwalk, they call me Catwalk Boy. [audience and Travis laugh] They call me Gerald, the Catwalk Boy.
[audience and Travis laugh]
Taako (as Tuff Greg): Well, uh, as I always say to the wife before I hop into bed, ‘Make room for Greg! ‘Cause, uh, Greg’s here.’
Gerald: Greg, do you have your ID -
Taako (as Tuff Greg): That’s my handle!
Gerald: Greg, do you have your ID badge on you?
Taako (as Tuff Greg): Sure.
Clint: Push him off the catwalk.
Justin: I cast Charm Person. [audience laugh/cheer] There’s my ID badge, you uppity so-and-so!
Griffin: I get to roll on that, don’t I?
Travis: No...
Justin: Yeah, with the Charisma check of CATWALK BOY.
Griffin: Yeah, I roll a Wisdom saving -
Justin: [giggling throughout] Maybe he is charismatic, he is just in the wrong line of work. [audience laugh] Uh, I attempt to charm… no, it’s even better, it’s a Wisdom saving throw. All the wisdom of Catwalk Boy. [beat] That’s a natural 20. [audience cheers, Justin giggles]
Griffin: Catwalk Greg just says,
Gerald: [beat] No. Not anymore.
Clint: Not on his watch.
Travis: ‘Not again!’
Griffin: And he reaches into his pocket and calmly says,
Gerald: Sir, I’m gonna need to ask you to calmly stay put.
Griffin: And he starts to pull out -
Justin: I’m sorry, did they arm him?.
Griffin: He’s actually pulling out a Stone of Farspeech. And is starting to bring it up to his face. What do you do.
Justin: (softly) Hold on a second.
Clint: Kill him.
Justin: I’m not gonna kill -
Clint: WHY?
Justin: I’m not gonna kill Catwalk Boy.
Clint: It’s a GAME. [audience laugh] He’s not a real person!
Travis: [laughs] Life and death is just a game to Clint McElroy.
Clint: [beat] Eh.
Griffin: [singing] You shoulda had these prepared, before you came on -
Justin: Well I didn’t know what kind of fuckin’ magical scenarios I was gonna get into! I am going to cast…
Griffin: Just draw a random one.
Clint: Kill. Him.
Justin: What? Just draw a random one, see how that goes? I could do that...
Clint: [growling into the microphone in a terrifying whisper] KILL. HIM.
Justin: Um, okay. I cast… Gust of Wind?
Griffin: Holy shit. [audience cheer/laugh]
Clint: Want me to do a little Foley work for ya?
Justin: No, that’s okay.
Clint: Okay.
Justin: Yeah, I cast Gust of Wind on him.
Clint: [makes a wooshing sfx anyways]
Justin: It’s only 25 feet, it’ll be fine?
Griffin: What is that, I don’t have that one in my doc.
Justin: It’s “a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction --”
Griffin: Oh, that ain’t, that ain’t him. [audience laugh]
Clint: And you know there are people underneath you.
Justin: What?
Griffin: That’s a 10. No. So sweet- sweet Catwalk Boy, [audience laugh] Are you blowing him towards the ring or just kind of into the crowd?
Justin: I’m blowing him into the crowd where they can catch him safely. [Travis and Griffin laugh]
Griffin: I’m gonna make a collective dexterity throw for ‘CROWD’. [audience laugh] That’s a 14, okay, they kinda catch him? You hear a,
Gerald: (gradually getting distant) Auuuaghghgaaaah! [audience laugh]
Griffin: And he actually comically drops his Stone of Farspeech as he goes. And the stage goes dark. And it’s dark for a bit and then you hear from the stone,
Gruff voice: Gerald? [beat] Gerald. Where’s the spotlight? Gerald.
Taako (as Tuff Greg): Go for Greg! [audience and Clint laugh] Hey, this is Greg, I heard you got a spotlight issue, my man.
Gruff voice: Greg? Where’s Gerald?
Taako (as Tuff Greg): Went out for a dookie break, brother. You want me to take the spotlight or what? [audience cheers and claps]
Gruff voice: Yeah, just get a light on my fighters.
Taako (as Tuff Greg): He went out to smoke a Fantasy Cigarette, and now you got Greg on the horn.
Gruff voice: Just turn the light on and shine it on my fighters!
Taako (as Tuff Greg): You got it, bubbeleh, any direction you want it aimed, or what?
Gruff voice: [beat] The -- FIGHTER-wards!
Taako (as Tuff Greg): Hey, no need to yell, my man, we’re all friends here. You got Greg on the job now. All right. I’ll fire up the spotlight, which I know how to use. [audience laugh]
Clint: ‘Cause you’re Greg!
Justin: Hold on. Let me do a... is it a magical spotlight?
Griffin: [snorts] NO??
Travis: (incredulous) Is it an electrical spotlight?
Clint: Careful.
Griffin: (carefully) No.
Clint: Everything you say becomes canon.
Justin: That’s right. Is it a cannon?
Justin: Okay, I’ll do a... Investigation check to see if I can --
Griffin: To see if you can figure out how to work spotlight. [Clint laughs]
Justin: That’s a 15 plus…
Griffin: Yeah, that’s good enough. Yeah, you know how to use Spotlight, it’s a fuckin’ light that you point at things.
Clint: At a certain spot.
Justin: Hey. (to the audience) If you’ve ever run spotlight before, raise your hand. [unintelligible] It’s an art, right? [crosstalk]
Travis: Wow, a lot of theater tech people at a D&D show. Who’d’ve guessed?
Justin: It’s an art.
Clint: Did you do it for a living?
Justin: No.
Griffin: No.
Clint: No. It is a hobby.
Griffin: We gotta move. We’ve been going for like 45 minutes, we gotta really get some --
Clint: And all of a sudden, all the lights go out.
Griffin: Okay, I’m going to describe now the four entrances of the fighters you’ll be facing off against, I’m just going to try to get through it as fast as possible so we can get into this thing.
Griffin: The lights go dark, a shaky spotlight comes up, and a burst of flowers, of roses, comes from the ramp, from behind the curtain. And out comes a woman wearing a red tricorn hat that reaches out to a sharp point forward, she’s got a yellow feather sticking out. Her costume almost looks like fencing gear. She doesn’t have like a fencing foil or anything like that but that is kind of her style. And the audience is like losing their mind for this fighter, [audience cheer] There is a sign that unfurls, that heralds her as Queen Sabine. And she is moving down this ramp with attitude. She’s got a pair of sunglasses on that she just kind of flings into the crowd.
Clint: Ah. Like David Caruso?
Griffin: When the FUCK has David Caruso ever been like, ‘Here comes a pun… The delivery of said pun.’
Clint: You know, I didn’t have to be here tonight, Griffin.
Griffin: Jess leans over to you and kinda hunkers down - ‘cause you’re standing like by the corner of the ring - and she says,
Jess: Okay, shit, that’s Sabine. We used to be tag-team partners but then she got injured so I got a new partner and then she got salty about it, and now we’re kind of bitter rivals.
Magnus: What’s her deal?
Jess: She’s very fast. Why don’t you leave her to me. Magnus, you focus on the other folks that come out that curtain, and Merle you just keep us in the fight. Once all six of us are in the ring, the fight’s gonna kick off.
Magnus: So it’s us two versus three people.
Jess: You got it.
Magnus: Yeahhh. Cool.
Griffin: And then the lights go out again and there’s an explosive pyrotechnic display and the sound of electric lutes that are just getting shredded. [audience laugh] And they are producing some truly gnarly butt-rock. A tapestry rolls down from the entrance ramp, it’s got a bunch of gothic symbols and a large flaming skull, and the name of the fighter who is emerging from the curtain, and that name is simply ‘Death Man’.
He is wearing a significant amount of greasepaint, but you can still tell that he’s a bit past his fighting prime, also evidenced by the fact that it’s taking him quite a while to get to the ring. Once inside he removes his black trench coat to reveal some big baggy black pants and a black tank top, and he’s got some big ol’ guns!
Travis: Is he bigger than me?
Griffin: Um, yes. And I think his promo is he just points at you, Magnus, and he points at his open mouth, and then he rubs his belly. [audience laugh]
Travis: I flip him off.
Justin: Is Death Man one that Merle recognizes?
Griffin: Yeah, I think… uh, no, this is a different franchise probably than the one that Merle was a fan of.
Justin: He liked that weird Canadian shit.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: And then the arena goes dark again, and this time a floating image of two moons appears over the ramp. [Travis giggles] Yeah, okay. [audience laugh]
Justin: Woof.
Griffin: And in front of that projection you see the silhouette of a man, who changes shape in the moonlight, transforming basically into a werewolf before dashing out of the projection. And a fighter appears at the top of the ramp. Their name appears in the image, and their name is Moonbeam.
Moonbeam is another sort of massive, hulking figure wearing a black spandex onesie with silver trim, and has a, actually a luchador mask on? From the edges of both the mask and the onesie you can see these big thick tufts of brown fur that are poking out, and there’s a big silver crescent moon on their onesie. And I think once they make it into the ring they point at you, Magnus, and they point at their open mouth and then rub their tummy? And then Death Man walks up and kinda tugs on their shoulder, like (vague whispering) ‘no you can’t..’ (whispering) ‘yeah, I just did that’
Travis: I point back at both of them and point at my mouth and rub my tummy with both hands.
Griffin: And then he just kinda sulkingly walks to the corner. And then the lights go out one more time, a spotlight shines down on the top of the ramp, and two large prop angel wings spread out from the sides of the entrance curtain. A sign swings down from the ceiling announcing the entrance of a fighter named Jeff Angel. And before I describe Jeff Angel’s entrance I would very much like to play his entrance music, which is the only piece of original music that I have prepared for the evening. (to the sound guy) If you could play ‘Jeff Angel’s Theme’ from… there it is. And really crank it up?
[MUSIC: ‘Jeff Angel’s Theme’ by Griffin McElroy begins playing]
Clint: Shh, let ‘em listen. [beat] Wow, I can feel that in my nards.
Griffin: Please do not talk over the drop.
Clint: Oh, right.
Griffin: (over the music) Wearing a pair of blue denim pants that appear to be cut off at the knee. [beat] Which is a type of wizardry your mind can barely conceive of. [beat] Wearing two bright green wristbands, and absolutely no shirt, enters Jeff Angel. [beat] Half bird, half man. [beat] With long bright white feathers and two long beautiful wings. You can turn down Jeff Angel’s theme song.
Travis: Without even thinking, Magnus bursts into applause.
[audience claps and cheers]
Griffin: The audience reaction to Jeff Angel is mixed, at best. [laughter] Uh, and, uh, he jumps into the ring and he flies up a little bit– he’s Aarakocra, by the way, which is a fun new D&D race. Um, and he grabs the microphone that’s starting to be raised up. He, like, grabs it and pulls it back down, and he says,
Jeff Angel: (with large, projected voice) My name is Jeff Angel.
[Travis clapping, audience giving a ‘mixed’ reception to Jeff]
Griffin: That’s great. Says, uh,
Jeff: And I value three things above all: integrity, hard work, and being nice to kids! Now, uh, I don’t know much about Jess’s new partner and manager here, but I do know one thing: these seem like the type of guys that forget to call their dads on their birthdays!
[audience boos/cheers]
Magnus: August 10th? I would never forget!
Griffin: He says,
Jeff: Well, Jeff Angel calls his dad every day!
[audience cheers]
Justin: From the rafters, you hear,
Taako (as Tuff Greg): (distantly) You tell ‘em, Jeff!
Justin: Gary’s a Jeff-head.
Griffin: And then, uh–
Justin: Greg. (in sarcastic voice) Sorry.
[audience laughter]
Griffin: And then, uh, [starts laughing] that’s the end of his speech. [continues laughing]
Travis: I call my dad every day!
Clint: [snorts]
Griffin: Back to Taako, real quick. A door at one of the ends of the catwalk opens up and two security guards come barging in. And just as they point in your direction [anticipatory music begins to play] and yell something, the starting bell below rings. Let’s roll some initiative.
[audience cheers loudly]
[MUSIC: “Jeff Angel Theme” by Griffin McElroy fades in]
{Commercial Break: 56:45-1:03:45}
[MUSIC: “Jeff Angel Theme” by Griffin McElroy fades out]
Travis: I got a 13.
Clint: I got a 14, but I roll again cus of some thingamajig that I have.
Griffin: It’s been so long. What’d you get?
Clint: 18!
Justin: Nice.
Travis: Plus what?
Clint: Plus...
Travis: Yep.
Clint: Plus...
Travis: Yep.
Clint: Somebody out there knows.
Griffin: Jesus.
Travis: No, that’s not what we’re doing!
Griffin: What’d you get Taako?
Clint: What, what am I doing? Where? What am I looking at? [audience laughter]
Griffin: Oh no, the app is broken.
Clint: It’s not so easy is it, smart ass.
Griffin: There you go. There’s a box called initiative―
Clint: See? Zero initiative so I was right, 18! [audience cheering]
Griffin: Okay, Regis Philbin. Taako, what’d you got?
Justin: Do you feel like I should have advantage on that cus I had the Arcane Eye that probably saw the door opening.
Griffin: Yeah, I like that!
Justin: Okay good. I had a―
Clint: We know you were really gonna try tonight.
Justin: I had a bad one but, 6. It’s initiative, that’s good! That’s what you want, you want low.
Travis: You want to go last.
Justin: You want low because it starts 1 and goes…
Griffin: Uhhhh….
Justin: Shit. I actually don’t know if that was a joke or not.
Clint: And that makes you adorable.
Justin: I just wait for people to say, ‘Go Taako!’ and ‘s like, ‘Okay! I’ll go!’
Griffin: First in the order is Merle! Off to the corner of the ring-- so again just to sort of lay out the objectives here: Magnus, you’re trying to beat the four fighters. Jess says she can handle Sabine, so really you’ve got Jeff Angel, Death Man, and Moonbeam. Merle, you’re off to the side, you’ve got to keep everybody sort of healthy and vital but if you want to get in there and mix it up that would be fun and inexplicable but go for it. And Taako you are beset upon by two security guards but you’re also trying to keep them safe from an assassin.
Justin: How far away are the security guards?
Griffin: I mean, it’s not gonna be your turn for such a long time―
Justin: Perfect.
Griffin: ―that I feel like I have a while to figure that out.
Justin: Perfect, that’s perfect.
Griffin: But they’re about 30 feet away from you. Let’s say 29 feet in case you’ve got a good 30-foot spell. Merle! What are you doing?
Clint: I’m going to do something really out of character.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I’m going to cast, like, a cleric thing. [audience laughter then cheering]
Clint: Yeah. I thought about casting Zone of Truth but I’m gonna save that.
Travis: (emotionally) I never call my dad!
Clint: For an even more inappropriate moment. I cast Aid, which is a spell that bolsters my allies with toughness and resolve.
Griffin: I bet you’re regretting wearing those prop glasses―
Clint: I can’t see shit. [audience laughter]
Griffin: Travis, just read his cards for him, I had to dress him backstage.
Clint: I did the resolve part.
Travis: Yeah, each target’s hit point maximum, current hit points, increase by five for the duration.
Clint: Some nice shit there, right?
Griffin: So now Magnus has five extra hit points?
Travis: Yeah, and it permanently- or it increases for the duration of the thing so you can heal back up to that level,
Griffin: Sure.
Clint: So I’m gonna cast that on… [beat]
Travis: Magnus?
Clint: Magnus! Played by Travis McElroy.
Travis: Well, you remembered that one, huh.
Clint: I have to.
Travis: Legally.
Clint: You’re a dependent.
Griffin: You cast a spell- You cast―
Travis: Wait, I am not! I am thirty-two-goddamn-years old―
Clint: Yeah but I’m still claiming ya.
Travis: Let’s never release this episode!
Griffin: Yeah. I think you cast that spell on Magnus and then from the crowd you hear like,
NPC: Yeahh, great buff.
Merle: Is that what it’s called?
NPC: It’s all about the f―
Griffin: You hear one cleric in the audience just go like,
NPC: Yeah man, it’s all about the fundamentals.
Clint: And it was on that night, July 15th, 2016: I cast a buff.
Griffin: Magnus, you are-- oh actually, next in the order is Jess and Sabine, who I think just do that wrestler thing where they just like, run up to each other and just like, start hitting each other very fast and they’re sort of tied up. Magnus it is your turn, next in the order.
Travis: I’m going to.. How are they all standing? Where is everybody.
Griffin: Each one is in like a corner right now. Or they moved in a little bit from the corner but they’re..
Travis: Do they have-- this is an important question.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Turnstile ropes, the whole ti―
Griffin: Turnstile ropes, three ropes, the whole thing
Travis: Great, I’m going to make like I’m running at Moonbeam.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Like, y’know, maybe like a stiff-arm.
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: But at the last minute I’m gonna pull stiff-arm, bounce off the rope and come at his back.
Griffin: Okay. I want you to, no joke, I want you to describe every maneuver that you do with that level of detail.
Travis: You’ve got it!
Griffin: Go ahead and roll your attack roll and then, depending on― [metallic clinking]
Travis: Oh, that’s my keychain! [laughs]
Clint: Don’t roll your keychain.
Travis: Oh, that’s a 3. [laughter]
Clint and Travis: [making a ‘WHOA-OH-OH’ sounds]
Travis: Plus 8, 11.
Griffin: God, that’s so many, but still no. So you do like a- you bounce off the ropes and you come at him with your stiff-arm and then you hit him and you just kinda like, push forward, like,
Clint: UuuUUhhHHHH [making a pathetic moaning sound] Can he make that noise? uuUUUhhHHHH.
Griffin: And I think Moonbeam just kinda pushes you away.
Travis: I get multiple attacks per round.
Griffin: Okay, go ahead.
Travis: And now I’m gonna try to, I don’t know.. Uhhmmm. [high-pitched, uncertain voice] Scissor kick, is that thing? I’m just gonna jump on Moonbeam’s back and cover his eyes.
Clint: Make him guess who it is!
Travis: Yeah, but like, in a really angry way. I’m a bad guy. Rawr.
Griffin: Uhh, okay. What do you think that would be, like a―
Travis: I think I would just do it.
Griffin: I think it would be a―
Travis: Acrobatics?
Griffin: No, I think it would be a strength check, probably.
Travis: Oh no, there’s one of my d20s gone. Okay. Strength check? I’m good at those!
Griffin: Yeah, cus he’s gonna try to wrestle you off.
Travis: That’s a seventeen plus eight, 25.
Griffin: I got an 18 so that’s good enough. Okay you’re now covering his eyes and kind of―
Travis: Oh, and also, I’m saying really mean things in his ear.
Griffin: Like what?
Travis: Like, you’re a poop and nobody likes you! I’m a jerk, rawr.
Griffin: Okay. I think next up is-- not I think, I have a list of people, it’s Death Man, is up next. Death Man is just gonna run and he was gonna attack you, Magnus, but I think he’s just gonna spear tackle the two of you.
Clint: Two of who??
Griffin: Moonbeam and Magnus.
Clint: Okay [sigh of relief]
Travis: Can I use my cunning action now?
Griffin: Uhh, no? [drowned out: It's not your turn-]
Clint: How many turns do you get?!
Travis: I get a lot man, how many spells do you get?
Clint: One a time.
Travis: Alright. Asked and answered.
Griffin: He tackles the two of you, which does damage to both of you, but it unfortunately knocks you off his back and both of you are now prone on the ground.
Travis: Poop.
Griffin: And take.. oh my god, take 11 points of damage.
Travis: I’m gonna do parry.
Griffin: Okay, what’s that do?
Travis: When hit, use the dice to reduce damage by d8.
Griffin: Okay, just do it.
Travis: Mmkay.
Clint: D&D, invented by Gary Gygax.
Travis: (to himself) Uhh, this one..
Clint: Welcome to the Exposition Zone!
Travis: That’s a four, plus my dexterity, which is two so, [unintelligible] 6.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Y’know what I didn’t bring?
Griffin: What?
Travis: Anything to write anything down with!
Griffin: Ohh no! Do we have a pen? Can somebody in the-- throw a, just throw a-- don’t throw it, that would be bad, but--
Travis: Please don’t throw it.
Clint: Because obviously we are not very dexterous.
[sound of a pen being thrown/caught]
[audience laughter and commotion]
Clint: Geez!
Griffin: Alright, please stop.
Travis: O-KAY. We are good now! Thank you.
Justin: Kelsey, everybody, thank you Kelsey!
Clint: Got a pen!
Griffin: Alright, uhh.
Travis: Thank you.
Clint: Some pruning shears?
Griffin: Next in the order is Jeff Angel. And Jeff Angel waves his hand in front of his face, and then disappears.
[audience cheering]
Clint: Would you guys buy action figures of these wrestlers?
Justin: I feel like a―
Griffin: That would be- we would get busted for intellectual property theft so fast.
Clint: Really, is that somebody?
Griffin: Have you heard of the wrestler named Jonathan Cena?
Justin: I like him, he was very, he was...
Clint: He was a great singer, wasn’t he?
Justin: Great singer, yeahh... What?
Clint: John Cena?
Griffin: Okay so, Moonbeam is next and Moonbeam stands up from being prone, so move action, and Moonbeam is going to get on top of you, Magnus, for a pin.
Travis: No he’s not-- wait, what, is he?
Griffin: He is going to get on top of you for―
Travis: Check your notes.
Griffin: Make a strength check with me.
Travis: Can I first, like, say something to him?
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Magnus: Let’s fuck up this old man first, like, if you beat me you’re just going to have to face him, so why don’t we tag team him?
Griffin: No, their only objective is only to take out you and Jess.
Travis: Oh, reeeally?
Griffin: Yeahh, it’s them four against you. What you got.
Travis: What are we doing? Strength?
Justin: Hey can I, quick time out. I feel like in the fiction he would have said that and I feel like you would need to respond, because it seems like in fiction he would have thought that―
Griffin: Okay, he says, uh,
Clint: Character voices!
Travis: I did mine.
Clint: Oh…
Griffin: He says, uh,
Moonbeam: No.
Justin: It's the character voice police.
[laughter]
Justin: We finally got ‘em all in one room boys! Everybody except the portly one. He crushes it every episode, he’s trying! [audience cheering]
Griffin: He says,
Moonbeam: I feel like I should listen to you but,
Magnus: Yeah.
Moonbeam: I think I’m just gonna pin you instead.
Magnus: S’fair.
Griffin: Are you gonna roll that dice?
Travis: Umm, it’s eight plus eight, 16.
Griffin: No, okay, he’s on top of you now so if it gets back to Moonbeam’s turn you have lost the wrestling match.
Travis: I’m not going to. I think the person that that definitely needs to be directed to is my buff friend.
Clint: Ohh really, arm chopper?
Griffin: First up is the- oh boy. A lot of stuff surfacing tonight. Next up, actually, is the security guards who run over to you, Taako,
Justin: Perfect.
Griffin: Recognize you as not one of their own.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Uhhm, and, I don’t know how they do it- maybe they have a special pair of glasses on that lets them see.. [gradually breaks into laughter]
Justin: It seems like you kinda cheated around my good idea.
Griffin: Okay, yeah no, okay. Alright alright, they run over to you and say, uhh. uhh... [beat] [choppy laugh] I fucking forgot his name already, Catwalk Gerald.
Clint: Jer, Jerry?
Justin: Catwalk Boy, I think it was.
Guard NPC: Catwalk Boy Gerald fell down and he came to us and said that a guy matching your description knocked him off. You wouldn’t happen to know anything about this, would you?
Taako: (as Tuff Greg) Yeah, you guys got me fair and square, let’s get outta here.
[audience laughter]
Griffin: Okay. They’re going to put a plastic zip-tie around your wrist and arrest you, Are You Cool With That?
Justin: Sooounds great.
Griffin: Okay, they just do it.
Justin: Okay, good.
Griffin: It is actually, you’re next in the order, it’s your turn.
Justin: Yeah, no. I cast Mislead.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I turn invisible at the same time as an illusory double of me appears where I’m standing.
[audience cheering & clapping]
Griffin:I will let the- I will break the laws of D&D to let these two things happen at the exact same time.
Justin: What- what do you mean?
Griffin: It wasn’t your turn but it can definitely be your turn.
Justin: You said it was my turn.
Griffin: It’s your turn now, yeah. But they arrested you on their turn.
Justin: They arrested me, that’s their turn, I didn’t want to raise suspicions.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: So, Mislead. And then I get the Umbra Staff up. Open. It has feather fall in it- I jump off the catwalk, onto the guy that currently has Magnus pinned.
[audience cheering]
Griffin: Yeah. Are you, are you―
Justin: But here, okay, here’s the other thing: the other―
[audience chanting Taako’s name]
Justin: The other small note of this, is that I can make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way I choose.
Griffin: So now you are playing fake-Taako-who-has-been-arrested, and invisible-Taako-in-the-ring?
Justin: Right.
Griffin: How long are you invisible?
Justin: Up to an hour.
Griffin: This spell is OP. Okay.
Justin: It’s a good spell! But I can’t direct- Okay, I can also see through his eyes and use his senses.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: But I become blind and deaf in my meat-form when I’m in spirit.
Griffin: So you just launched your body into like, darkness without seeing like, where you were going if your invisible form is the one that can’t see or hear?
Justin: But I’m- no, I choose at will.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And right now I want to see the guys jumping on the guy.
Griffin: Okay, yeah you see the guys jumping on the guy. Yeah, you land on Moonbeam and knock him off, saving Magnus from the pin he just―
Justin: Perfect. And then I get the hell out of the ring.
Griffin: Okay, yeah, you probably had a little bit of move action.
Justin: Arcane eye is still active, I still have an overhead view of the ring. And now I’m prob- I’m just cruis―
Griffin: Jesus, okay, so you’ve got like a fucking full blown like picture in picture―
Justin: I’ve got a fucking snake eyes style security network, like, fucking, I’ve got my eyes in the Gary, I’ve got-- or what’s his name? Greg, I’ve got my eyes in the Greg. Greg eyes up. I’ve got Arcane Eye. And then I’m cruising, I’m just patrolling around, walking around―
Griffin: Here’s what I’ll―
Clint: You’re like Jesus or something.
Griffin: With your floating eye then, I will say this: after you jump down, you see a shape up on the catwalk that was standing basically right next to you, before you jumped down, that was wearing a Chameleon Cloak that was sort of hiding them. They don’t see your floating eyeball, so they kinda poke their head out, and you see a figure up on the catwalk that you just jumped down from.
Justin: Great, okay.
Travis: Probably fine.
Justin: But my turn’s gotta be over as hell by now, right.
Griffin: Your turn is super duper over.
Justin: Okay, yeah.
Griffin: I also wanna make clear, you two do not know about this figure at all.
Travis: That’s fine.
Justin: Cool.
Griffin: Merle, you’re next.
Clint: I don’t even know what the hell we’re talking about anymore.
Griffin: Great! Merle it’s your turn. Merle, actually, before you go, Jess, who is like, still like, just her and Sabine are just like, having a Punch! Jess, mid-punch, she’s like turns to you and points down at the ring and like points like, she’s pointing under it like,
Jess: [subtle whispering] Look under the ring, under the ri―
Griffin: She’s mouthing,
Jess: [subtle whispering] Under the riiiING.
Clint: And she’s pointing at her ass like that?
Griffin: Nope.
Clint: Does she need one of those hemorrhoid cushions?
Griffin: And it’s your turn.
Clint: [beat] Oh, you said no hemorrhoid jokes. I forgot, I’m sorry. In pre-show prep. I forgot that.
Griffin: What’s your- what are you going to do on your turn, in the game, Dungeons and Dragons?
Clint: I’m gonna go look under the ring!
Travis: Yaaayyyyy!
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: Roll a d20 for me.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: Yep.
Audience member: Do you know which one that is!?
Travis: He got it.
Griffin: Ohh, sick fucking burn from the crowd!
Clint: C’mon, let’s go! C’mon!
[audience cheering]
Travis: Sit down dad, it’s not worth it.
Clint: My arm fell off.
[audience laughter]
Justin: He actually has a caddy―
Clint: My arm fell off.
Justin: And this caddy has each one labeled so,
Clint: We’ll be selling these in the lobby after the show.
Justin: WE WON’T.
Travis: We won’t! You liar.
Clint: Guys this, it’s pre-marketing.
Travis: It’s not, it’s lies.
Justin: Pre-marketing for non-existent products!
Griffin: (slightly exasperated) Please roll the dice.
Justin: Clinton!
Travis: He rolled it, he got a 15.
Clint: 15! What am I adding to it?
Griffin: Okay for a fift-- Nothing, it’s just a roll to see what you pull out from underneath- this is kind of like a Fantasy Gachapon of its own. [audience woo-ing]
Griffin: I have a table―
Clint: And I get to keep it, right?
Griffin: It is a big metal ladder, is what you pull out from under. I’m also going to say that doesn’t count as your action. Now you have a big metal ladder and―
Clint: What kind of magic does it have?
Griffin: The- It can get you up higher? Levitation, but like, a super efficient form of Levitation?
Clint: Oh, alright. How high is it? How tall?
Griffin: 8 feet.
Travis: Have you watched wrestling, ever?
Clint: I watch Olympic Wrestling. I watch Greco-Roman wrestling.
Griffin: I will say―
Travis: Wait, hold on. (in a high-pitched incredulous voice) Do you?
Clint: (in the same tone of voice) Nooo.
Travis: Oohkay.
Griffin: I will say this―
Justin: Okay, super quick. Raise your hand if you’ve ever wrestled for a sport. Okay, there we go, that’s Travis.
Clint: (loudly) I was a, (in a normal tone) oh you were, weren’t you.
Travis: Yes I was.
Clint: I went to every wrestling match he did.
Travis: And watched me lose every time!
Clint: He lost every match! The one time I didn’t go―
Travis: No, we don’t have to tell this story.
Clint: The one time I didn’t go [beat]
Travis: I beat a kid with the flu.
Clint: He beat a kid with the flu.
Travis: It was the one time I ever won at wrestling.
[audience cheering & laughing]
Griffin: The things you pull out from under the ring can be used for whatever you want, they can also be used as improvised weapons. That’s what the stuff under the ring exists for.
Clint: You’re really leading me down the path here, aren’t ya.
Griffin: Nah, I’m saying do whatever you want you have an improvised weapon or you can get up high and change a lightbulb or… [audience laughter]
Clint: Alright! I take the magic ladder, with all the powers it has, and I hit [beat] somebody with it.
Griffin: Which one?!
Clint: (off mic) Shit!
Griffin: Jeff Angel, Moonbeam, or Death Man.
Clint: (uncertainly) De- The m-moon Jeff.. being deathblown-
Travis: He moons Jeff!
Griffin: Oh, you know what? Moon Jeff is an acceptable answer, because of your ingenuity, it’s long enough you could probably hit two of these boys with it. [cheering]
Clint: I knoww, Griffin. I hit [beat] Moon and Jeff.
Griffin: Okay, roll your d20.
Clint: [unintelligible]
Griffin: Plus seven, it’s a plus seven!
Clint: So that’d be 20!! I hit him with a 20.
Griffin: Okay yeah, that’ll hit both of them. Roll one d12, the twelve-sided one.
Clint: Oh, schnickey.
Travis: Yeah, you got it. He can do it. [audience laughter]
Clint: I feel like I oughta be taking them out of a little silk purse and a fly comes outta it.
Travis: Okay, move it along.
Clint: Here comes a twelve.
Travis: It’s a 12.
Clint: It’s... a 12!
Griffin: Nice, okay.
Clint: [laughing] Damn, I’m good at this game.
Griffin: So, actually, what you did, to make it clear, you threw it at Moonbeam and it also hit the invisible Jeff Angel, knocking him out of invisibility.
Clint: Did I kill ‘im?
Griffin: No, but―
Clint: (hushed, to himself) Shit.
Griffin: ―Moonbeam looks bad off. Next in the order is Jess and Sabine, and I think Jess actually manages to get one over on Sabine and has her pinned. Next in the order is Magnus.
Travis: I’m gonna pick up that ladder.
Griffin: Nice.
Travis: Thank you. And I’m just gonna two-handed swing it at ol’ Moonbeam.
Griffin: Okay. [isolated, single audience member clap]
Travis: Thank you.
Clint: The ol’ ladder bash.
Travis: Uhh.. oh, that’s not gonna do it―
Clint: Boy, this being-honest stuff is not working for you.
Travis: Well, I’m not using my good dice, where’s my good die? There we go.
Clint: Yeah, roll―
Travis: So that was a 4,
Clint: Roll the dice that doesn’t have a four on it―
Travis: ―and that doesn’t do it. But now I’m gonna backhand swing for my second attack.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: [laughing]
Travis: [beat] That’s not any better, that’s a 6.
Griffin: So many whiffs! No, no, no, and no.
Travis: Perfect. I’m now going to use Cunning Action. [audience member cheers] Thank you. To get away.
Griffin: Okay. Where you going?
Travis: Uuhmmm. I’m actually going to get on the other side of Jess so that she’s flanking Sabine.
Griffin: Okay, that’s fine.
Travis: I’ve still got the ladder in my hand.
Griffin: That’s fine.
Travis: And I hold it in front of me like a shield.
Griffin: Magnus, make a dexterity saving throw for me.
Travis: That’s a thirteen plus two, 15?
Griffin: Okay, you- as you are making that action a dart flies by your neck, just missing you by an inch, and sticks into the ring, and you see it stick into the ring and then it vanishes in a puff of black smoke.
Travis: Was it Jeff Angel?
Griffin: No, it didn’t come from anybody in the crowd or in the ring.
Travis: Can I do a quick perception check to see if I can tell where it came from?
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: That’s a thirteeeeeEEEN.... Yep.
Griffin: It came from above. [audience laughter]
Griffin: Next in the order is―
Travis: I look at Merle and I just point to the catwalk.
Griffin: Next in the order is Death Man? Who’s actually gonna run over and try to stop Jess from pinning Sabine. And that’s a 2, so he’s just like,
Death Man: Cut it out!
Merle: You bad lady!
Griffin: And then Jeff, I think, is going to spread his beautiful white wings and fly up in the air and then come diving down with a kick on you, Magnus.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: And he rolls a 22 versus AC, that’s probably gonna do it.
Travis: That is gonna a hit.
Clint: Now, he does have the ladder held up in front of him as a shield.
Griffin: That’s only 9 points of damage.
Travis: Yeah, it’s still gonna hit. What?
Griffin: 9 damage. Please don’t do anything else to―
Travis: Yeah it’s fine.
Griffin: Moonbeam is up next, and what Moonbeam does is really interesting.
Travis: He cries.
Griffin: Because he looks like he’s about to run at you, Magnus, and then he stops. And he sniffs and he goes, [sniffing sounds], and he looks around the ring, and he looks directly at you, Taako,
Travis: Holy shit!
Griffin: And he runs over to you Taako, and grabs you? And as soon as he does, your invisibility wears off, and he picks you up, and he lifts up a claw to come swinging down at you and he goes,
Moonbeam: Taako! What the blazes are you doing here?
Travis: It’s Klaaaaaaaaaaaaarg!!!
[audience cheering & clapping]
Griffin: And he takes―
Clint: It’s Kelsey Grammer, ladies and gentleman!
Griffin: And he takes off his luchador mask, and it is Klarg, the bugbear.
Travis: YEAH!!! [audience cheering]
Griffin: And he says,
Klarg: As I live and breathe, Taako, my dearest friend! What are you doing here?
Taako: Well.
Griffin: It’s a beautiful reunion.
Taako: I was invisible. And now I’m not, so thank you for that, that’s good.
Klarg: I’m sorry, I thought I smelled your beautiful musk.
Taako: And indeed you did, very perceptive.
Klarg: I just want to say, I want to clear the air. The last time we saw each other, you made me jump off of a motorcycle, onto a tank, into a laser beam, and I just want to say, I understand why you had to do that―
Taako: Sure.
Klarg: ―and I’m not angry.
Taako: Uhhhh. It’s good to see you.
Klarg: It’s very good to see you.
Taako: I, I uhm.
Klarg: I have a new tea backstage I’m very excited about, I think you’re going to love it.
Taako: First off, let’s say the obvious: I’m sorry. Didn’t mean to try and kill ya.
Klarg: That was really sweet. I have something I also want to―
Griffin: And then he- you hear like a BZZZT, and he goes rigid.
Taako: Son of a bitch.
Griffin: And then he fucking suplexes you. [audience crying out ‘Noo’]
Justin: Nooooo.
Griffin: I actually think he grabs you and jumps off the top rope with crazy bugbear acrobatics and jumps like, ten feet in the air and suplexes you. And that’s a 24. [audience groaning]
Justin: Let me see, let me check my AC. [audience laughter]
Travis: I’m gonna force disadvantage because I said I was wielding as a shield, and I’m gonna use my protector thing to make him have to roll again.
Griffin: I don’t think you were within five feet of him.
Travis: How big is the fuckin’ hexagon!
Griffin: It’s big, it’s a, y’know, it’s big. [audience laughter then some scattered boos]
Griffin: Okay, yeah, no, I’ll roll it again. [laughs] How about a 21? Does that still get there?
Justin: That’s a hit, yes.
Griffin: He does this insane, like, diving suplex and you get hit for 28 points of damage. [audience ‘Ohhh’-ing]
[beat]
[scattered laughter]
Clint: That’s bad, right?
Justin: Not great.
Griffin: And you are prone. And he says,
Klarg: (in a deeper, angrier tone) You made me jump off of a motorcycle, onto a tank, and get shot by a laser!
Taako: [beat] True. Guilty-- listen, listen, listen: Taako earned that one. That’s a- I’ll grant you that suplex for free. Don’t do it again, I will literally die.
Griffin: I think the security guards are next, do we play out what―
Travis: [laughing]
Griffin: ―fake Taako does?
Justin: Well, okay, here’s the only problem, I need- No, we can’t because I need a bonus―
Griffin: I think the- actually the spell’s broken, probably, when he shook you out of the invisibility?
Justin: He got me out of the invisibility, didn’t break the other guy, but I need to use a bonus action to be able to switch my awareness, so I wouldn’t see what that...
Griffin: Okay, we’ll then-- they’re just like―
Justin: But he is- The thing about him though, the programming I left him with, he is chattering incessantly and saying the most banal, like, state-of-the-world things. So literally, every word out of his mouth, constantly, because I didn’t teach him how to listen, is just like,
Dummy Taako: (as Tuff Greg) So! Crazy weather we’re having, huh? That’s how Greg sees it anyway! You guys going to the Padres game later?
Guard NPC: No like, stop, wait, hold on, we have to ask you questions about how you broke through our security―
Dummy Taako: (as Tuff Greg) No, no, no, listen, I love being here with you guys, this is great! You got any SOH-DA?
Justin: Every time Greg says soda, that’s how he says it.
Griffin: Taako you’re actually up next- whoa― [Assuming their reactions, the house lights or lights came on, showing the rest of the crowd]
Travis: Hello everybody.
Griffin: Hi everybody.
Clint: Ha ha, oh MY GOD! THEY’RE OUT THERE!
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Taako, you’re up next. You got, uh, uhh. Sabine’s about to pin somebody―
Travis: No, I thought Jess had Sabine.
Griffin: Yeah, Jess has Sabine, sorry, Jess is about to pin Sabine. You got three other fighters, and you have a dart that just came at Magnus from the catwalk.
Justin: Okay, I cast Cloud Kill.
Griffin: What the fuck?
Justin: That’s a cool name, right? Yeah, so check this heat. I created a 20 foot radius sphere of poison- this is at the center of the catwalk [clicks tongue]. You create a 20 foot radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range.
The fog spreads around corners, it lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog (good luck indoors) ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured, so cheese it with the knives. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on or on a turn, it starts its turn there. The creature must make a constitution saving throw and, uhh. Well, we should start with that.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Still, again, let me remind you―
Griffin: Oh my god!
Clint: ―there’s a bunch of people underneath this!
Justin: Yeah, but it’s a 20 foot sphere. It’s a 20, folks!
Griffin: No that’s a 1!
Justin: That’s a 1, actually, on that one. So that’s a critical failure.
Griffin: Yeah, yeah, no, this..
Justin: I failed as hell, so now it’s going to take five d8 poison damage.
Griffin: Holy shit. [audience ‘Ohh’-ing & cheering]
Justin: Uhhm, Okay, uhh, okay good. They’re affected even if they hold their breaths, so let’s see what we got here. Four. Six, 10. Seven,
Clint: 17.
Travis: 17.
Justin: Five,
Travis and Clint: 22.
Griffin: Wow, show-offs!
Justin: Two.
Travis: 24.
Justin: Is that all, is that five?
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Was that five?
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: What was the total?
Justin: What?
Griffin: One more, apparently, everybody’s saying one more.
Justin: One more. That’s a seven.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: 31.
Justin: I point at the sky and say,
Taako: I got that fart touch!
Justin: And then emit a Cloud Kill―
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: ―into the air.
Griffin: I think in the interest of moving things along the, this shadowy figure goes next and you hear a,
Cloaked Figure: Augh!
Griffin: As they get this bad bad poison damage and then they cast Gust of Wind to push the poison cloud directly downward into the ring.
Justin: Hell yeah! [audience exclaiming “ouhh”s]
Griffin: I need everybody to make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Ohh yeahh. [beat] Ohh noo... [laughter]
Travis: I rolled a 13, or I got a 13.
Griffin: Oh my god. [Clint rolls]
Clint: Ohhh no.
Griffin: Ohh my god.
Clint: I rolled a... 6…
Griffin: Holy shit, this is gonna hit everybody! Holy shit, IT HIT EVERYBODY.
[audience laughter & clapping]
Griffin: How’d you do Taako?
Justin: 13.
Griffin: IT HIT FUCKING EVERYBODY.
Merle: Smooth move Ex Lax.
Taako: I tried my best.
Griffin: One- how many is it, five d8?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: One. That’s seven. Holy shi― [indiscernible audience member]
Griffin: You can’t- I’m trying to add things. What? Oh yeah, dwarves are- have something―
Travis: Thank you, that one time tonight, but not again. You have advantage against poisoning, roll again.
Clint: Yeahh! Oh yeah, I do. Ohh, thank you Jesus. [beat] 19! [audience cheering]
Travis: But just that one time!
Clint: But never do that again.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Okay. So it’s 20 points of damage.
Travis: That’s nothing to me.
Clint: Ha!
Travis: I take 20 points of damage when I eat my breakfast.
Clint: Wait a minute, do I take 20 points of damage?
Travis: No.
Merle: Oh guys, you don’t want me to be the last one standing.
Griffin: No you’re fine.
Magnus: We actually do, you’re the cleric!
Merle: What does that mean?
[audience laughter]
Griffin: How’s Taako?
Justin: He’s alright.
Merle: Is that like, an accountant?
Griffin: Are we about to have a Taako-death, like, time paradox situation on our hands?
Justin: Nah, I’m good.
Griffin: Okay. I think with that, ‘cause we have been going for, like an hour and a half now?
Travis: Yeahh.
Griffin: That takes out a few folks. I think Sabine gets pinned. I think Jess takes quite a bit of damage but she is still up. Death Man goes down- actually, no, Death Man is fine, Jeff goes down and― [audience ‘awhh’-ing]
Griffin: Yeah...
Travis: FUCK JEFF! [audience laughter, one going “BOO JEFF”]
Clint: You wouldn’t buy his action figure and now you all love him!
Griffin: So this happens and you feel a quake happen throughout the crowd as this happens and everybody’s just like, running off because now they’re terrified of this poison cloud that has descended upon the ring and nearly killed everybody.
And that figure falls off the catwalk, into the ring, and you see a woman with short red hair wearing that Chameleon Robe, and she has like a, bandolier with those darts on and she’s got a staff. And she falls down and helps herself up and says,
Cloaked Figure: (winded) I don’t know, which one of you is working with Garrigos, but I don’t have time to wait anymore and figure it out.
Merle: It’s him.
Griffin: She looks at you, Taako, and says,
Cloaked Figure: You. Powerful wizard.
Taako: Euhh.
Cloaked Figure: Master wizard.
Taako: (giggles)
Cloaked Figure: Are you an acolyte?
Taako: (tittering laughter) What?
Cloaked Figure: Are you an acolyte of Garrigos?
Merle: Say yes. Say yes.
Taako: Yes...?
Merle: Yes.
Magnus: No, no!
Taako: No! I’m―
Magnus: Don’t ever listen to dad!
Taako: I’m but a humble cooking wizard whose ratings are bound to improve if people start dying on this show.
Merle: The Voidfish is gonna have its work cut out for it making everybody forget this shit.
Griffin: She says,
Cloaked Figure: My name is Marie. I’m a magus of the Order of Tempus, the war god? But see, like, my war god- let me explain some stuff.
Magnus: Okay.
Merle: [laughs]
Marie: Tempus is a war god of honorable battle, and Garrigos is an old, long forgotten god who is the patron of raiders and wanton violence―
Merle: Oh, that would be us.
Marie: ―and I received a missive that an ancient cell of the Cult of Garrigos survived and was operating out of Neverwinter and I tracked them to this place- to the Chaos Theatre.
Griffin: And she takes a dart and throws it at one of those banners that had been hanging from the walls and you actually see, I think, Merle, you’d recognize it-- actually, make a religion roll for me. Merle, maybe-- yours is more of an earthy religion? I don’t know if you―
Clint: Sure!
Griffin: ―how well read you are.
Travis: The d20.
Clint: Twelve plus religion, four-
Griffin: Okay, yeah that’s enough.
Clint: 16!
Griffin: You see the sigil that is hidden underneath this banner, it is five arms that are sort of folded in a circle and they’re all holding scimitars, and that is the sigil of Garrigos and you realize that this is―
Clint: Carey are you writing this down?
Griffin: For the fanart later?
Clint: Write this down, Carey―
Griffin: You can’t ask people―
Clint: ―cause that’ll be awesome. [audience member whoo-ing]
Griffin: This place, this old building is actually an old temple of Garrigos that has been―
Magnus: Who planned this shit? [beat] [gasps] Oh, it’s humanman!
Griffin: And there is- after this one act of, let’s call it what it is: wanton violence, as this poison cloud descends upon the ring, Marie explains that,
Marie: This match, the Supreme Champion Finals, this represents a ritual of revival that is supposed to bring back the avatar of Garrigos from the realm of banishment, where a wanton marauder would slay the four champions of the land. Sound familiar? Yeah, I think we’re in some real bad stuff. I don’t know why my voice got so much deeper all of the sudden.
Clint: (in a deep voice) Yeahhh.
Travis: I’m Jess now!
Marie: I took out Brock Thickstone because he was involved and I was trying to figure out who was here and it got really confusing who else was a co-conspirator, but uh, fast forwarding through a lot of plot because this fight took much longer than Griffin thought it would.
[audience laughter]
Clint: (makes really bad fast-forwarding sounds)
Travis: Oh no, he’s had a stroke!
Griffin: Let’s fast forward to the end of the fight. So there is a―
Clint: We win!
Travis: The end.
Griffin: No no, you have not won. There is a tremor after this cloud came down and it’s been kind of steady as she explained her situation and the ritual of resurrection just happens. It’s not a lengthy process, all of a sudden-- you don’t even see them appear, it’s like they’ve been there for an eternity but in a different plane. There are five humongous, blood-red arms with these massive hands- these massive, clawed hands- all reaching upward and kind of slamming the ground. They’re all popping out from different points of the ring, on the outsides of the ring. And they’re trying to pull a body out of the depths.
And the crowd has scattered, one of the pillars actually falls inward to the crowd, which is mostly evacuated at this point, but it lands. And when it lands you actually see a few chairs away from it, you see Angus, who’s like holding a big pretzel―
Clint: Oh please-
Travis: I don’t―
Clint: Oh, pleeease.
Travis: I want you to know, Magnus is not even hesitating- takes off to grabs Angus.
Clint: No. Noo.
Griffin: That’s good. So this pillar falls and he’s just holding a big pretzel―
Travis: I spring off of the ropes to grab him.
Griffin: And he’s wearing a Jeff Angel t-shirt. [audience makes scandalized groaning]
Travis: I still grab him but I rip the t-shirt as I do, and I whisper in his ear,
Magnus: Fuck your t-shirt.
Griffin: So you’ve just torn the clothes off this small boy!?!
Justin: A great look. At any time.
Griffin: And the crowd has scattered except for one figure who is sitting in a big comfy-looking chair behind the announcer’s table. You see Merrick, the CEO of Battlefest who draws a small dagger from a hidden sheath and he drags it across his stomach. [audience groaning]
Griffin: But he’s not cutting his belly open! He’s just cutting open his robe and a giant, dark orb emerges from it. [audience laughter]
Griffin: And the orb is glowing a bright red with a swirling crimson cloud suspended within and he’s laughing with malice, but also with kind of, like, relief, because his plan just came together?
Travis: You know.
Clint: Like you do.
Travis: We’ve all been there.
Clint: Yeah.
Travis: When your plan comes together and you just sit there and go [laughs]
Griffin: Jess, who is still standing, grabs Sabine and grabs Jeff Angel and like, drags them up the ramp and is like,
Jess: You guys got this!
Griffin: Death Man just like, runs away.
Justin: NICE.
Griffin: So it’s just you, in the ring-- this will complicate things-- with a still-very-angry Klarg, and Merrick off to the side holding this orb. Magnus, actually, you’re in the stands with Angus just sort of running around, and we’ll get back into it. I guess we’ll start with top of order.
Justin: Well, I did something while that was― I want to do- take an action while that happens, I didn’t want to interrupt you.
Griffin: In fact I think actually, we’re running so late on time, let’s just drop initiative and just like, if you want to do something in this scene let’s just fucking do it.
Justin: Okay. [audience cheering]
Justin: The first thing I’m going to do is reach into my cloak and pull from my cloak a small, exquisite chest. And then I pick up that chest and I throw it to the ground-- a chest also exquisite, but larger, emerges from another dimension―
Clint: Is this like those russian dolls?
Travis: A matryoshka.
Justin: ―pops open and everyone’s weapon’s in it.
Taako: Come eat. Everybody come get some, come get a taste!
Griffin: Okay you are re-armed. Merle, I think you reach into the chest and just fling the ax at Magnus to catch it―
Travis: While he’s doing that I throw Angus into the ring. [audience laughter]
Clint: And the ax hits him!!
Travis: I’m getting him out of harm's way!
Clint: The ax cuts him in half!
Travis: ‘s fine. [audience whooping]
Griffin: It’s beautiful.
Clint: It’s like 4.99 on Amazon. That was it.
Griffin: Taako, one of the giant hands reaches down and slaps you for 8 points of damage.
Justin: Okay. I cast- is it my- I cast Bigby’s Hand.
Griffin: You did kind of just go.
Justin: Well I know, but you just said―
Travis: No, you want this to happen.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: You did say- he slaps me and I create a large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space. My hand is an object, that has AC 20 and hit points equal to my hit point maximum and it has its strength of 26, +8, and dexterity of 10, and I smack that fucker right back. [audience cheering]
Clint: Come onnn. Say it! Say it!
Justin: No.
Clint: Say it, pleaseee.
Justin: No!
Clint: Please, say it for daddy.
Travis: Let him say it.
Taako: Abracafuck you!
Clint: Yeaaahhhh!!!!! [loud cheers from audience]
Griffin: I think you don’t even roll. I think you just fucking, astrally high five this thing so hard, this arm just explodes and you hear from below you, you hear a really angry, deep voiced scream.
Justin: Okay, good.
Griffin: You guys want to do anything?
Travis: Yeah I do. I’m gonna start charging up these stands towards Merrick to two-handed attack him.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And I want to do it as like, a jumping attack, y’know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: Great. I just do it?
Griffin: Yeah, roll d20.
Travis: Oh, okay. [beat] I’ll take that, that’s- because I have Railsplitter back, plus nine, is 21?
Griffin: Yeah that’s definitely good enough.
Justin: Super quick, just sidenote, I just have one hitpoint left so if anything happens to- let’s keep an eye on cha’ boy, okay?
Travis: And I do―
Clint: Was that directed at me?
Justin: Just everybody—
Travis: And I do eleven points of damage.
Justin: Generally speaking, I have one hitpoint.
Griffin: What’d you do?
Travis: Eleven points of damage.
Griffin: Okay, that does not kill Merrick but it is enough to send the orb flying up and into the air and it looks like it’s about to fall and it just kind of bounces as it lands- like it doesn’t shatter- and it bounces really really high up and a spectral hand appears and grabs it out of the air.
Travis: I hit it with my ladder for the second attack of my action. [audience whoops]
Griffin: Okay. What are you hitting?
Travis: The orb.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: What would that be a check of? Just a ladder attack? [laughs]
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: That would end up being a 15.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s fine. You see Merrick reach out and you see this red Mage Hand reach out to try to grab the orb as it flies away from him and you just kind of smack it away from him and it’s flying far away and then you see a blue Mage Hand appear and grab it out of the air and suck it back to the ring and Angus is holding it―
Travis: YeaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!
Griffin: And he’s holding his wand out.
Taako: THAT’S MY BOY! THAT’S MY BOY!! MY BEAUTIFUL, MAGIC BOY.
[audience cheering & clapping]
Griffin: He says,
Angus: WHAT DO I DOOO?
Griffin: And he’s like, running around the ring as these four―
Magnus: Angus! Keep away!
Angus: What does that mean??
Magnus: Just like we do with you with your books.
Griffin: Okay, Merle, Merle make a- he throws the ball at you, make a dexterity throw.
Clint: A dexterity, okay.
Travis: Doing great.
Justin: Roll a d20.
Clint: Okay.
Justin: Don’t break the mo.
Clint: It’s uhhhhhhhh―
Travis: Eleven?
Clint: ―hhhhheleveeeeeeen
Justin: Eleven.
Clint: And- no, I have a zero modifier.
Travis: Yeah, eleven.
Justin: Zero, it’s eleven.
Griffin: Yeah that’s good- it’s kind of clumsy but you manage to catch it with one hand and all of a sudden these four hands are now slapping towards you as you hold this orb, what do you do?
Clint: Oh, well.
Justin: Give it to―
Clint: You have one- shouldn’t I, shouldn’t I heal him? [audience ‘YEAHHH’-ing]
Travis: Why start now?
Justin: Can he toss it as a free action?
Griffin: Yeah, I think so.
Taako: Toss it to the guy with the fork.
[beat]
[audience cheering]
Clint: Ohhhhhhh.
Travis: Now...
Griffin: Hold on. No no no no. This orb is so big, there is absolutely no way I’m going to let this happen.
Justin: That’s what I thought when he took the Blazin’ Challenge at BW Three’s but he still did it.
Griffin: No.
Travis: That’s a true story that I’ll tell you all about later.
Griffin: Merle what are you doing?
Justin: I look at him, and I, as a free action say,
Taako: I can’t die. Literally, I can’t die! Don’t worry about me, I live longer than this!
Griffin: The magus woman says,
Marie: Throw it to me, throw it to me, trust me.
Clint: I toss it to Marie.
Griffin: She catches it and she holds it in her hand for a second―
Magnus: And then she eats it.
Griffin: And she says,
Taako: You should have eaten this stuff! This is delicious! You guys fucked up.
Griffin: She says,
Marie: Magnus, I uh.. I really like your costume it looks really cool, and I like your character and I think it’s really well-developed out.
Griffin: And as she says that the orb starts to glow a little bit less and the hands kind of recoil in pain,
Magnus: Oh, I see.
Griffin: and then she tosses it to Taako.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: She says,
Marie: You don’t understand! Wanton violence and destruction is what summons Garrigos, the only thing that can put him back in the realm of banishment is the opposite of that.
Merle: We can do violence!
Taako: No, I can do this! [beat] All the spells I cast tonight worked super good and they were really dope and it was awesome!
Griffin: Nothing happens.
Justin: Nothing happens. [audience laughter & clapping]
Magnus: Toss me the orb―
Taako: Angus! That was fucking great.
Griffin: He says,
Angus: Thank you sir. It’s nice to- it’s nice to get positive reinforcement from you for literally the first time ever in my life.
Taako: Don’t get used to it.
Griffin: And as you say that the hands ceasing the, sensing the huge―
Justin: What a sacrifice it was?? [cracking up]
Griffin: ―what a huge sacrifice that was, the hands actually recoil a lot and the ball is now glowing half as bright as it was before.
Magnus: Pass me the rock!
Griffin: Actually, Taako... Oh that’s only a 9. You’re probably good. Okay, yeah, one swings at you and you just kind of jump out the way.
Justin: I do have to pee so if I need to die, it’s fine.
Griffin: Pass that rock, actually, we’re almost―
Clint: Do I- Can I heal his ass?
Justin: It’s a waste of energy, I don’t die! Like cause we live- okay, so we’re doing a story right now, and it takes place after this story and I’m in it, so like... I can’t die.
Clint: You died like seven times in the last month.
Griffin: Marie yells,
Marie: Pass the rock! Pass the rock! Pass the rock!
Justin: Okay, I pass it to Magnus.
Travis: Alright. Do I just catch it?
Griffin: Yeah, you got it.
Travis: Okay.
Magnus: It’s been a pleasure fighting with you, Klarg. You are a worthy opponent.
Griffin: He is like furious right now when you say that to him? He's like,
Klarg: Yeah, I know. I'm huge and big you've almost killed me like six times just doing things you want me to do.
Magnus: But I also know that you have a good heart.
Klarg: I don't. I promise, I'm a big- I'm a bit-
Merle: Ohh, I see what we're doing.
Griffin: He stands up, he gets rigid again he goes,
Klarg: Thank you, Magnus. I really wanted to hear that.
Travis: I throw him the rock.
Griffin: He grabs the rock and he says―
Taako: What do you think about me?
Klarg: Since the day the three of you came into my lives
Merle: (starts humming-singing)
Klarg: I have been enriched in a way that I- AAHHHH
Taako: Fuck!
Griffin: And he stands up rigid again and he goes, (laughs) I think he just goes to attack Taako, actually, while holding this rock.
Clint: Wait a- I haven’t healed him yet!
Griffin: 11? Versus AC.
Justin: I got 13. [audience cheers]
Griffin: Alright, but he is still holding this orb. And these hands look like they’re maybe regenerating a little bit. What do you do to get the orb away from him?
Justin: Dad, cast something.
Clint: Okay. I cast.. Zone of Tr... [audience cheering]
Griffin: No, I love it!
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: I love it, I love it, I love it.
Travis: No no no. Clinton.
Griffin: No, do it! Do that shit!
Clint: I cast Zone of Truth! [cheers and applause]
Griffin: You cast Zone of Truth and Klarg still in like rage mode is just like,
Klarg: (takes a deep breath) I just love you guys so much! [applause, cheers] I’ve never had a friend before and I know that you’ve taken advantage of me a lot but I can also sense the good in you and I just want to say, I think you’re the best dudes I’ve ever met and do you want to go take a trip to Aspen with me?
Magnus: Actually that sounds great.
Klarg: My dad has a cabin in Fantasy Aspen and I think we’d have a really great weekend there together.
Clint: Your face is beet red right now.
Griffin: I know. I’ve been screaming for a while. As he's, as he's—
Clint: So what happens to the orb?
Griffin: The orb is just like dimming and dimming and the arms are just shrivelling up and receding back into the ground and I think as he just goes on and on, and actually it was sweet at first but then it gets a little bit uncomfortable? He goes on and on, and then finally: the hands just disappear in a puff of red smoke.
Justin: You saved the day!!
Clint: I saved the day!!! [audience cheering & clapping]
Audience member: We love you, Merle!!
Merle: God bless Zone of Truth! [beat] Pan bless Zone of Truth.
Griffin: Klarg is just standing there holding this orb and it turns to black smoke in his hands. And he’s just standing there and he’s like,
Klarg: I just don’t know what to do with you boys, I’ve- [applause]
Taako: (singing) Here you go again~♪ [Clint laughs]
Magnus: My man!
Klarg: Yeahhh.
Merle: Check this out―
Magnus: We met a whole family of bugbears down in Lucas what’s-his-face’s lab― they’re totally cool. We saved them. They’re fine. Do you want to go hang out with them?
Klarg: You telling me my family still wants me back after what―
Magnus: YES.
Taako: Hell yeah.
Merle: Yeahh.
Klarg: That’s amazing, thank you for tying up my storyline like this.
[audience cheering]
Travis: [laughing]
Griffin: And I think as the last of the red hands sort of disintegrate in the portals they were popping out of shut close and the black orb disappears. I think there’s like a shock wave of force that comes out from the ring that knocks up some popcorn and discarded signs in a whirlwind and a gigantic battle fest supreme champions Finals banner falls from the ceiling slowly like―
Travis: Like the last shot of Jurassic Park?
Griffin: Like Jurassic Park.
Clint: Like Jurassic Park. [roaring]
Griffin: And you hear a heavy metal clunk come from the stage- Oh. One of the hands grabs Merrick and drags him to hell as it goes back to―
Clint: Yeah. Yeah.
Travis: Merrick just excuses himself.
Griffin: You hear a heavy metal clunk in the middle of the ring and you see the title belt laying there.
Travis: I Put It On.
Griffin: Well, Jess actually comes up to the stage―
Travis: She left.
Griffin: And she says, uh,
Jess: Well, you boys never cease to amaze, that could have gone real south, real fast, thanks for the help. As for the title belt, a duo can compete in the Supreme Champion Finals but only one of them can take home the belt.
[audience “Ohh”-ing]
Travis: As she reaches for it I put my foot down.
Griffin: She actually says,
Jess: Yeah, why don’t we fight for it?
Griffin: And then I want to fucking like, Rocky II freeze frame like―
Travis: Yeah!!!!
Griffin: (sings) Bah baba bah. [audience cheering and clapping]
Griffin: That was the episode of the Adventure Zone.
Travis: Thank you!
Griffin: Thank you all so much.

Griffin: Hey everybody, this is Griffin. Real quick, before we get into this episode, I wanted to give you a heads up that the audio is not amazing. This is our live show from Tacoma, and the levels were a little bit too hot, and it’s a little bit blown out because of that. It’s still totally listenable, but it’s not really up to snuff, and I’m very sorry about that. I hope you enjoy it regardless. We still really wanted to put it out, because this is our Candlenights episode, and it was a lot of fun to record, and we wanted you to hear it anyway. But I wanted to give you a heads up, that, yeah, the levels aren’t super super great. But, yeah, we’ll be back next week, though!
If you haven’t heard, we’re going to be trying to go weekly, starting in January, with the rest of the experimental arcs, and I’m going to be running the next one, and i’m really excited for you to hear it. So the next one, the next episode you hear is going to be our Setup episode for my next arc, and that is going to go up on Thursday, January 4th. So go ahead and listen to our Candlenights Adventure, and I’ll be back with the commercial break here in a bit!
{1:00}
[Intro music]
{1:30}
Griffin: Alright, so I’ve got a poem I wrote to walk us into the adventure tonight. Uh, and if you could go ahead and play the… Poem Background Music? [sleigh bells jingle and continue under Griffin’s poem] There we go. [audience laughs]
“‘Twas the night before Candlenights,
and all through the land–”
Griffin: Oh, that’s a little loud. [laughs]
Clint: [loudly] What?
Griffin:
“And all through the land,
danger clawed upward
with a dark frozen hand.
In the depths of a dungeon
at the edge of the world
a conflict was brewing,
an adventure unfurled–”
Griffin: If you could just bring the music down even more. [Clint laughs] Just like, half that, oh there we go.
“In the hold known as Icekeep,
a voice within wails
and echoes off mountains,
through valleys and trails
and into New Phandalin,
a town you’ll recall,
whose mayor became troubled
by this sad caterwaul.
So she called out for heroes
in a media blitz
for a mission: well paying,
with good benefits.
So did heroes emerge
and embark on the quest,
and all ended in failure
and their dark, endless rest.
Save for one team of heroes–
and you might know their names–
Merle, Magnus and Taako
of Adventure Zone fame!
[audience cheers]
They saved the world once
and were financially stable,
but when trouble arises
they’re still willing and able
to battle for glory
in a worthwhile melee
or find treasure for Taako
to squirrel away.
And so stand Tres Horny Boys
before the Icekeep
to hunt down the crier
and put it to sleep.
If only they knew
of the traps and the fights
that awaited them all
on this cold Candlenights.”
{0:03:33} [Poem Background Music ends]
Travis: Griffin, I didn’t have a pen, could you repeat that?
Griffin: So the three of you are standing before the entrance to Icekeep, a frozen, subterranean dungeon past the hills surrounding New Phandalin. The call-to-arms put out by the village’s mayor attracted countless parties who sought to silence the voice in this dungeon-- a voice the three of you hear loud and clear calling from the depths. But none of those parties ever returned.
Travis: [goofy voice] Come on into my dungeon. [audience laughs] Is that what it sounds like?
Justin: No.
Griffin: No it sounds like–
Justin: I like to party with my peeps, cruise ‘n creep, playing Three-Card Monty in these crazy streets. [audience laughs]
Travis: Way too many of you are like “I get it!”
Clint: Yeah, how do you know what that is?
Justin: You’re monsters.
Griffin: Justin has made us watch the intro to The Pest, the horrible movie, like 70 times today. In your trademark hubris the three of you assume that you might have better luck at silencing this voice. And it’s like a crying voice, like a deep like [Griffin sobs in a deep voice] but it’s super loud and maybe scary. The entrance is built into the side of a massive glacier a hundred yards or so ahead of you, but you can barely see it through the massive snowstorm that’s been covering the land for weeks now. However, there are other shapes in the snow that stand before you and the entrance, shapes that you can not quite make out through the storm. Everybody roll a perception check for me.
Justin: My die is flashing. [audience cheers] That means– hey folks, if you cheer for every 20 I roll tonight, that will probably be the last one. I can see everything, Griffin. I can see individual snowflake shapes!
Griffin: Uh, Taako, you can clearly see–
Travis: [interrupting] I got a 16.
Griffin: Taako sees it the best.
Clint: I got a 2. [audience cheers]
Griffin: There’s very cold, weird rain falling from the sky. Um, Taako, you can clearly– and Magnus, but Taako the best– you can clearly make out what these shapes in the snow are. You see razor-sharp icicles jutting out of the ground, stabbing 10 feet upward into the sky, turning the snowfield in front of you between you and the entrance to Icekeep into something of a grisly scene because impaled on a number of these icicles are skeletons, nearly frozen in the storm, their rotted adventuring gear still hing off their lifeless forms.
Travis: Here’s what I want you to picture: we all see that, and I just sloooowly reach to my belt and turn it to “ice”.
Griffin: Yeah. [beat as the audience laughs] Shit. I didn’t even think about…
Clint: And so do I.
Griffin: You don’t have a magic immunity belt. Uh, OK, Magnus will take half damage on ice attacks. Fuck. Uh, so that is the situation. There is a field of sharp icicles jutting out 10 feet into the sky between you and the entrance to this glacier that you really still can’t quite see.
Magnus: Let’s go!
Griffin: What do you do?
Travis: Magnus rushes in. [audience cheers] I mean I– Can I tell you at this point, I, a more mature, adult Travis don’t want to rush in, but I’ve painted myself into a corner, fictionally speaking.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Roll a dexterity saving throw for me.
Travis: [groans] That’s an 11… Plus two, though! So 13– Wait, saving throw? Yeah, that’s plus two, so that’s a 13.
Griffin: Yeah, an icicle, as you take your first step into this snowfield, shoots out of the snow and jabs you right through the shoulder and you take… 22, or 11, points of ice damage.
Travis: I don’t have a pen, so I’ll just remember–
Griffin: No. Do we have a pen backstage Sam, or– [at this point, someone in the audience throws a pen onto the stage] oh, OK!
Clint: Oh god!
Griffin: Nobody else! OK, I wanna say, I wanna say, I wanna say– This is an important PSA: never throw things at people while they’re performing on a stage. But that was the best fucking pen throw, it landed perfectly on the table.
Travis: You did crit that– Stand up, who threw that?
Clint: Security! Security!
Justin: [crosstalk] I feel bad.
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m impressed!
Griffin: Get them out of here, they threw something at performers on a stage!
Travis: OK.
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: Nah, they’re cool. It’s fine.
Griffin: They’re cool, it’s fine. That was a joke.
Justin: But was it? No more throwing things.
Griffin: Oh and hey, security, where were you all on that one? I kind of expected a sort of–
Travis: I mean, it turned out fine, but–
Griffin: A clear and present danger.
Justin: Yeah, I want to see bodies flying and [slow-motion deep voice] “Noooooo”
Griffin: OK, Magnus, you are impaled.
Magnus: Owwww.
Justin: By a pen!
[Griffin laughing]
Magnus: Alright, everybody, this– Apparently there’s icicles and they’re mad.
Clint: Now is he stuck there?
Griffin: Uh, I mean you could probably break it off.
Justin: So when he hit it, icicles fell down?
Griffin: Came up from the snow.
Justin: Oh cool, it’s like a trap!
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Yeah. Cool.
Travis: Wait, so the only thing we have to do to avoid this trap is turn around and leave.
Griffin: Would be a short show. These people waited a long time.
Travis: I’m waiting for one of the other two of you to do something.
Justin: Yeah, I’m just gonna, uh, use a little item I call the Hole Thrower and throw a hole into it.
Griffin: Into what?
Justin: The ice. There’s like a– you can’t get past, right? The way you described it–
Griffin: Nononono. Let me– I’ve failed.
Justin: Weave your tapestry again, sorcerer.
Griffin: There is a large field of snow, and there’s icicles coming up out of it. It’s not forming a barrier or anything, you can get past. It’s just, Magnus took one step into it and an icicle-
Justin: Oh, sh–
Travis: And when it impaled my shoulder, am I lifted off the ground? Am I kind of dangling?
Griffin: No, you’re burly enough that it doesn’t quite, uh, raise you up.
Travis: OK so I’m still on my feet and it’s through the back and Taako’s like “So what’s going on? What happens?”
Justin: Um, OK, I’m gonna cast– How far is it? Is there an entrance?
Griffin: About 100 yards. Yeah, you can see, there’s a door, you can barely make it out in the side of this glacier 100 yards ahead of you.
Justin: I am going to... cast... a spell…
Clint: Called...?
Justin: Called… Continual Flame. I’m gonna cast Continual Flame on the tip of the Umbra Staff.
Griffin: Shit.
Justin: And I’m going– So that will make it into a flame except it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. [audience laughs] OK, so I do that, I make a thing that looks like a fire, and then I– and then I’m like “This gives me an idea!” Stupid. I cast Investiture of Flame.
Griffin: Invest in some flame.
Justin: Flames surround me in a 30-foot radius for the spell’s duration. That’s really powerful to traverse a dumb trap, isn’t it?
{0:11:04}
Griffin: No, I like it. ‘Cause we’ve been on it for about 30 minutes now.
Justin: OK, so I cast Investiture of Flame, there’s a 30-foot radius– um I–
Griffin: How’re your boys doin’? Are your boys–?
Justin: No, they’re in my bubble!
Griffin: OK.
Justin: And, um–
Griffin: I think Magnus, roll a dexterity saving throw to get in his bubble because I think–
Justin: No, I have spell shaping, so I would shape it around him.
Travis: I got a 15.
Griffin: OK, you’re fine. [exasperated] You don’t have spell shaping anymore, I don’t know how many times I have to tell you–
Justin: I do have spell shaping.
Griffin: When you– God, OK, when you specced as a transmutation wizard, you don’t have spell shaping, that’s an evocation wizard thing. Come on! Alright, so anyway–
Travis: Who can say for sure when this story takes place?
Griffin: A whir– Do you guys wanna be level 1? [Travis: No…] A whirlwind of flames surrounds Taako and the other two and reveals some dead grass below your feet as the snow melts away and it catches some of the–
Justin: Any loose change?
Griffin: Uh, yeah, there’s probably some che that’s fallen out of–
Justin: How much exactly in gold?
Griffin: Not much, like 7 gold.
Justin: Count ‘em.
Travis: Nice. That’ll get you a sandwich and a hot cocoa.
Griffin: But as soon as it touches these icicles they also melt away, so you are protected from any more icicles. You’ve solved my icicle puzzle.
Travis: Thank you. I can’t finish if you don’t say it. Finish the puzzle. You monsters. OK, so we sprint towards the entrance.
Griffin: As you approach the entrance, the snowstorm picks up, and I’m assuming the spell has died down by now, and you’re not just going to be surrounded by flame for the whole episode. The snowstorm picks up and it’s biting at your face with these chilling winds
Travis: Brrrr.
Griffin: And you’re standing before the doors leading into this glacier and they are massive 20 foot high double doors carved from oak. And they’re surrounded by this enormous 1 foot deep metal archway covered in runes and emblems resembling snowflakes that just wraps around the whole double door. Everybody make a perception check again.
Travis: I got an 18.
Justin: Got a 5 on that one.
Travis: 19 total.
Clint: TWO! [audience laughs] I swear to god, it’s a 2.
Travis: Why would you lie about that?
Clint: I don’t know.
Justin: If it’s a 1?
Clint: To lean into the mythology a little bit.
Griffin: Magnus, you can’t quite make it out exactly, but you can see faintly, just barely, through the storm, a figure on top of this metal archway surrounding the door, like 20 feet up, and it seems like they’re tinkering with something up there, and thanks to the snow they haven’t– despite the fact that you just wreathed yourself in flame– they haven’t seen you yet.
Magnus: Hey!
Griffin: You yell “hey” and you hear a loud click from the top of the archway.
Magnus: What are you doing?
Griffin: And–
Magnus: Are you picking a lock?
Griffin: And then–
Magnus: Because we want to go in, too! We can hear a voice, can you hear a voice?
Merle: Are you an elf?
Travis: You can’t see THEM, too!
Clint: I can’t? Oh yeah, right.
Merle: Who are you talking to?
Magnus: Shut up, Merle!
Justin: OK, that’s what neither of your characters sound like. These people paid a lot of money to see– to come see us, so if you could.
Magnus: [in a deep Magnus Voice] Hey!
Clint: Oh, god, we’re on that again.
Griffin: Uh–
Justin: Not again, still on it.
Griffin: Magnus, as you yell “hey”, as you yell that, you hear a startled yelp come from up there and suddenly the figure falls backwards off the arch.
Travis: Oh, no, that was a 2, did not catch him.
Griffin: Tumbling down and down, and it’s stopped in midair by three icicles that shoot upward, impaling and killing them instantly. And you can see this figure now: it’s a man, a very large man.
Travis: [high-pitched groaning]
Griffin: A very large man with a bushy white beard and a tummy like a bowl full of jelly. He’s wearing a red suit and hat and–
Clint: [laughing, obviously slightly distressed] You killed Santa!
Travis: Now hold on, fuck you, is this The Santa Clause?
Griffin: And he’s carrying a large bag made of canvas and moments after he’s impaled, that suit and hat and bag is all that’s left of him as his body disappears.
Travis: Fuck you, Griffin. [audience cheers as Griffin, Clint, and Justin start laughing] My brother, the monster.
Griffin: His body just disappears leaving the clothes and bag crumpled in a heap at your feet, and on top of this pile, a golden scroll materializes out of the air with the words Read Me scrawled on the side in intricate letters.
Travis: I turn to Merle.
Griffin: Uh, the letter opens up, actually, and a voice reads out loud:
Dead Santa: If you’re reading this, it means that I have died.
Travis: [in deep Santa voice] Completely by accident and nobody’s fault.
Dead Santa: If you’re reading this, it means I have died. Hopefully not by your hands, because that would be very, very naughty. Ho, ho, ho. A little joke!
Travis: [in deep Santa voice] But I am dead, so like, bummer.
My name is Santa Claus, and if you’re reading this, then I’ve got news for you, pal: now your name is Santa Claus. This mantle that I have upheld for decades has been passed down to you, just as it was passed down to me. It’s a very important mantle, my new friend. Santa Claus is responsible for spreading the spirit of Candlenights throughout the land by delivering toys and gifts to all the young people of the world.
Clint: How big is this fucking scroll?
Griffin: It’s pretty big.
Travis: [in deep Santa voice] “Turn over”.
Dead Santa: During my time as Santa, I have delivered millions of presents to those innocent souls deserving of them. I might have even delivered some of you– some to you, friend, in your youth. But seeing as how I am now dead as disco, I think it’s time to confess something. For several years now, I have neglected that sacred charge for one child in particular, and I have done so because that child dwells in the Icekeep, a place I am very, very afraid of! Ho, ho ho! When reports reached me about the crying from Icekeep, I knew that my dereliction of duty was the cause, and so I have decided to set right my terrible oversight and deliver a present to this sad and lonely child. But if you’re reading this, I guess I didn’t do a very good job. Ho, ho. I hope my death was quick and painless.
It falls to you now, friend, to succeed where I have failed. Don my suit and my holiday Bag of Holding and venture within Icekeep to deliver this fateful Candlenights present. Now, I don’t know what kind of youngster waits for you down there, nor do I have any idea what kind of gift that youngster will desire. The holiday Bag of Holding can produce any gift that its owner desires, so I am hoping you’ll be wise enough to figure it out once you get in there. It’s imperative you don’t abuse this power though. That kinda goes against the reason for the season. Well, that’s it, I guess! Time to get busy living or get busy dying. Looks like I’m stuck doing the latter. Ho, ho, ho.
Griffin: S.C.
Taako: You know, that was a weirdly specific letter.
Magnus: Wasn’t it? Yeah.
Taako: Is he– Does this mean Santa Claus, every time he leaves the house, is recording a new death note? Like–
Magnus: “I was just getting some milk.”
Taako: “Heading to Piggly Wiggly now, hope I don’t die! Anyway…”
Magnus: “About to eat a big plate of chicken wings, hope I don’t choke to death!”
Clint: Merle casts Raise Dead. [audience cheers]
Griffin: Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah. There’s no body. I KNEW you were gonna do that, I made the body disappear! [audience cheers louder]
Travis: You can fuck off, old man!
Clint: Shit!
Griffin: Always trying to destroy my plots. Also, that spell takes a day to cast. OK–
Magnus: What else are we doing?
Griffin: There’s a Santa suit, there’s–
Magnus: I’m not putting it on. I’m not the Santa type, I think that goes to Merle.
Merle: [begrudgingly] I’ll put it on.
Magnus: Well hold on. Taako do you want to–?
Clint: Is Tim Allen here?
Travis: God, I hope not.
Griffin: [at the same time as Travis] Thankfully no.
Justin: Probably not.
Magnus: Taako, do you want to be Santa?
Taako: I’m not a bear.
Justin: [as the audience starts cheering] Ah, thank you.
Magnus: Alright, Merle.
Merle: Yeah, I’ll do it.
Griffin: As you put on the Santa suit, Merle, a glowing enchantment surrounds you and this light glows around you brightly, and as it fades you realize that the suit has been tailored to fit you perfectly, and you also notice that your beard is sort of [stammers] a grey, scraggly beard, with probably some twigs and leaves and other–
Travis: And like, 7.
Griffin: And shit. It’s actually now this huge, bushy white beard that-
Clint and Travis: A big bushy beard!
Griffin: And it’s a real beard, it’s not just stuck on.
Travis: I pull it.
Griffin: That light–
Travis: I pull it.
Griffin: It hurts.
Merle: OW! I-I’m sorry [Merle voice] OW!
Griffin: Thank you. And then that light–
Travis: I pull it harder.
Merle: Owww, OWW, SHIT!
Magnus: It’s real!
Justin: Let him weave his tapestry.
Griffin: Uh, yes, and then that light that’s surrounding you, Merle Santa, uh, it shoots out of your body and it surrounds your two friends and when it fades from them, you see their wardrobe has ched too. They’re now wearing these green, kind of silly outfits [Clint starts laughing] with jester’s hats and jingle bells and boots that curl up at the toes. [Clint is absolutely losing his shit]
Clint: Oh, god, I love these liveshows.
Griffin: And with that, the mechanism that Santa was activating– I didn’t think about this, but Santa? Master thief. Uh, was activating-
Travis: He does sneak into houses.
Griffin: That’s true. That he was working on at the top of the arch stops whirring, and as it does the double doors into the Icekeep sweep outward, granting you access to a hallway of rough cobblestones leading downward. And after travelling down this hall for several hundred feet, the corridor ends at a sheet of thick ice, which as you approach it, slides upward.
Travis: Wait, I assume there’s tiny bells on our shoes?
Griffin: Oh absolutely. [Travis starts making little ting noises] So stealth checks are just out of the question.
Travis: OK.
Justin: Uh, OK, we’ve been going for about 20, 25 minutes now, in case anyone was stuck in traffic, let me catch you up: We killed Santa, and now my dad is Santa, and we’re elves, and we’re trying to find a little kid in an ice cave to give him a present. That’s pretty much everything.
Griffin: Thank you, Justin.
Justin: And I cast a 6th-level spell, so if I- If you’re keeping track of that.
Griffin: And as you enter the chamber just beyond this sliding ice door, it slides back down cutting off your exit. Bringing us to the second section of the adventure that, I’ll be honest, I thought we were gonna get to just- way faster. You take a moment to survey this new chamber. It’s a cavernous, circular room, the exterior wall of which is made of smooth, thick ice. The floor is made of stone, but you can barely see it through the thick carpet of snow that covers this room up to your ankles. Flanking the central diameter of this room are two snow banks that extend 10 feet and raise all the way up to your waist.
As you enter the room, you see something just off to your left: another one of those sliding ice doors is in the process of closing, and for a moment you see three people behind it. Three aarakocra, to be precise, which is a race of humanoid bird-people. One is burly and carrying an axe with plate armor, one is more slight with two daggers and ragged leather armor, and one is shorter, carrying a staff and wearing a set of black robes. And you see them just for a moment as the door slides shut, you hear th–
Magnus: Hi!
Griffin: You hear their muffled conversation as they move deeper into the Icekeep. You hear one voice say
Aarakocra 1: Awww, man. Looks like we’ve got company.
And another voice says
Aarakocra 2: We’d better hurry, we can’t let them get credit for this job.
And a third voice says
Aarakocra 3: Don’t sweat it, Ray. If they catch up to us, we’ll just kill them, too.
And on the other half of the room that you’re in–
Travis: I wanted bird friends, but they sound mean.
Justin: Yeah, they just sound mean.
Griffin: On the other half of this circular room that you’re in, you see something, uh, else kind of strange. You see the snow start to whip up off the floor, and as it does, they unearth the bones and belongings of fallen adventurers below. And those bones start to rattle and reform themselves into two full, standing skeletons. And then the snow surrounds those skeletons, forming these thick, round bodies around them. The loot from those adventurers then lifts up off the ground and suddenly one of these snowmen is wearing a tophat and has a crude face made of gold coins, while the other–
Travis: Oh no, they killed Uncle Pennybags.
Griffin: While the other has a leather helmet and a carrot for a nose. And after forming, these two snowmen pull spears of ice up out of the ground and emit a chilling roar. Roll for initiative. [audience cheers]
Travis: I got 21.
Griffin: Damn.
Justin: 18
Griffin: Wow.
Justin: Plus...
Clint: Wait, we get plusses?
Justin: 3.
Griffin: That’s two 21s.
Clint: OK, I rolled a 14 plus…
Travis: Plus 2. That’s a 16.
Clint: Plus 16.
Justin: I’ve been sitting on the edge of my seat this entire time. I paid for the whole seat, but I only needed the edge.
Travis: My leather girdle doesn’t let me sit back.
Griffin: First up is actually the gold-faced snowman.
Travis: [shocked, a little indignant] I rolled– I got 21.
Griffin: I know, two of you did. The gold-faced snowman takes their ice spear and raises it up and throws it at Taako. Taako… that is a 18 versus AC.
Travis: Try again. Disadvantage. Protection fighter.
Griffin: OK. That’s a sssseven.
Justin: ...No.
[audience and boys laugh]
Griffin: This ice spear- the, the, the gold-face snowman throws it and it comes within an inch of you. It, it– [Travis hits Justin in the head with a prop shield as he tries to mime protecting him] You didn't have to hit him in the head with it as a, yeah.
Travis: I just wanted him to know…
Griffin: This ice spear travels the length of the room and comes just thiiiis close to hitting you, but it doesn’t. Next in the order is–
Justin: Do I bend, like the Matrix, or–
Griffin: Yeah, it was totally sick.
Travis: [indignantly] I did it!
Griffin: Taako, you’re actually up next.
Justin: Oh, cool. Uh, I’m gonna melt ‘em, ‘cause fuck ‘em. Right? Uh, I’m gonna cast Wall of Fire. In a– on the two snowmen in a kind of line that would hit both of them.
Griffin: Here’s what happens.
Justin: Uh oh.
Griffin: You conjure this wall of fire and as it starts to leave your hands, it seems like it hits the center of the room and it just stops and it activates almost like a force field, cutting a line across the center of the room, dividing you three and these two snowmen. And the spell just disappears as it hits this force field.
Justin: Hmm, OK. Hold on, this is a force field that is…
Griffin: Imagine a circle. Imagine the diameter of that circle.
Travis: Now what if you could take that circle…
Griffin: Yeah, there’s just a line across the center of this circle and uh-
Clint: And the spear went through it?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: I r– OK, is it my turn?
Griffin: Uh, yeah, actually.
Travis: Alright.
Griffin: Unless, you know what? I’ll bump Taako back in the order, I’ll say because of your failed attack, you do get to go again so that you don’t get cheated out of your turn.
Travis: OK, because I think it actually was my turn.
Justin: OK, I’m going to cast… a different spell that I like very much… Ice Knife? As a third level spell?
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: On… Are we fighting the birds too?
Griffin: BIRDS?
Justin: The bird-men, obviously.
Travis: [crosstalk] No.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, the birds left.
Travis: [crosstalk] The [fighter birds?] are gone.
Justin: OK, I’m gonna throw a 3rd level Ice Knife at one of the heads of the snowmen.
Griffin: There’s gold-face snowman and carrot-face snowman.
Justin: I’m gonna go for carrot top.
Griffin: OK. Yeah, roll it. I assume you roll an attack on that one?
Justin: That’s a… 4. It misses quite badly.
Clint: It misses so badly it hits the other one.
Griffin: No, it does miss, but it does pass through that barrier.
Justin: OK.
Griffin: Magnus, you’re up next.
Travis: I’m gonna throw Chance Lance.
Griffin: OK.
Travis: At gold face. My favorite Dick Tracy villain.
Griffin: Alright.
Travis: That’s an 18– oh, 16.
Griffin: Alright, you throw it and it hits that barrier in the center of the room and bounces off.
Travis: Alright, I’m gonna try something else with my second attack.
Griffin: Think about what Taako just learned.
Travis: I know, shut up.
Griffin: And really put it together.
Travis: Alright, Chance Lance comes back.
Griffin: Follow the clues. You had all the clues you could have saved them. It’s literally a snowman reference.
Travis: What if I coat it in the snow? Like, dip it in the sn– like pack snow around it and throw it?
Griffin: I want you to stop.
Travis: Maybe I just–
Griffin: No.
Travis: Maybe I just stick it in the snow for a while and it gets real cold.
Justin: No, but really, stop.
Griffin: Stop it. Now really think about what you just said.
Travis: I throw a snowball at Goldface.
Griffin: OK.
Travis: That is a 12 plus my…
Griffin: Whatever your regular attack modifier is.
Travis: Plus 8. So it’s a 20.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s a good hit on Goldface. Roll a d10 plus your attack modifier.
Travis: [laughing] How does that work? “I kept it in the freezer all summer”. Uh, 9 plus my attack modifier, is plus 4, so 13.
Griffin: Yeah, you hit him good. Uh, it knocks Goldface’s hat right off and takes a chunk of head out, too. And Goldface yells real loud at that.
Travis: I’m gonna dual wield with another snowball.
Griffin: OK, how does that work?
Travis: I have, I think, 8 attacks at a time I can do. And we’re trying to move this show along quickly.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Clint: If you want to go out and use the toilet, this would be a good time to do it.
Travis: That’s another 12 plus 8, 20.
Griffin: Yeah. That’s a hit. But you have to roll twice, right? On a dual wield.
Travis: Uh– no, this is just the second attack. So 6 plus 4, 10.
Griffin: Yeah. They are just barely hanging on to life. That one got their middle ball and now you can see some exposed skeleton bones. Ewww. Gross.
Travis: Grody.
Griffin: You got any more attacks or are you out of attacks?
Travis: I mean, I could.
Griffin: The next in the order is Merle.
Clint: Point of order: if you knock Frosty’s hat off, he stops dancing around. So shouldn’t he be dead? [Audience Cheers] I could sing the song for you. “Frosty the Snowman–”
Justin: Stop, stop, no. Can’t.
Travis: Right now, Griffin is looking at his watch to determine whether or not this fight has already taken long enough.
Griffin: No. Incorrect. But the gold-face snowman is like, almost down.
Clint: OK, I cast Sacred Flame at the–
Griffin: Oh my–
Justin: [crosstalk] OK, but you didn’t–
Travis: [crosstalk] Throw snow.
Justin: No, stop, no, stop.
Merle: I cast Ice Shard.
Justin: You don’t have to say that in character voice. Go ahead.
Travis: Unless you are in character, announcing that out loud.
Justin: [laughs] OK, go ahead.
Clint: Merle casts Ice Shard.
Justin: Thank you, thank you.
Griffin: What’s that look like?
Clint: A big shard of ice, and it does 40 damage.
Griffin: OK, I just looked up Ice Shard in the book, but there’s no spell called Ice Shard.
Travis: You don’t even have a fucking card called Ice Shard!
Clint: I know that, Travis!
Travis: Are you cheating our brother at D&D?!
Clint: Frost Bolt! I cast Frost Bolt at him.
Griffin: That’s a fucking World of Warcraft spell!
Clint: I throw a freaking snowball.
Griffin: Awesome.
Clint: Jeez. Alright, boom, there it goes. And it’s a freaking 6!
Justin: [quietly underneath Clint] Clerics have a 4th-level spell called Ice Storm.
Griffin: Ice Storm? That sounds really cool.
Justin: Ice Storm, doesn’t it sound cool?
Clint: But I get to roll–
Griffin: WHAT DOES ICE STORM DO, JUSTIN?
Justin: It wouldn’t help in this situation, Griffin, it only creates a hail of rock-hard ice pounding to the ground in a 20-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder at a point within range.
Travis: Now let’s assume–
Clint: That’s what I said!
Travis: Let’s assume that in a different multiverse, our capable dad, Dad Two, cast that.
Justin: Played by Tommy Lee Jones.
Travis: The DC version of our Marvel dad cast that.
Clint: Yeah. So I roll a d20 now?
Griffin: Uh, no–
Clint: I cast Ice Storm on both of them.
Griffin: OK, let’s all take a beat. They have to make dexterity saving throws. Gold-faced one rolled a 6, that is not going to do it. Carrot-faced one rolls a… 14, which is not gonna beat your spell save throw modifier. So roll 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage. OR I’ll just do that for you.
Clint: Wait, I got it. 4… 1… 3...
Griffin: [doing math as Clint rolls] So that’s 5… I’m gonna say the gold-faced snowman goes down as they are bludgeoned by this snow. The carrot-faced snowman is also missing some chunks at this point.
Magnus: That was very impressive, Merle. You’re very capable.
Taako: And you reacted so quickly. There was literally just a split second in between the action before and your action.
Magnus: You truly are the most capable member of the team.
Griffin: Carrot s–
Clint: Ho, ho, ho!
Justin: OK.
Griffin: Carrot snowman throws their ice lance at Merle, trying to fight back against this hit. That’s a 22 versus AC.
Travis: No it’s not. Protection fighter.
Griffin: Uh, that is a 19 versus AC. Merle.
Clint: I thought he was protecting me.
Travis: It’s a tie.
Griffin: It’s a tie.
Clint: It’s a tie!
Griffin: I always forget, does that hit? [several audience members respond in unison: “It hits”] Yeah, it’s a hit.
Clint: [exasperated that this audience has betrayed him] Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Travis: Ya hit him. A palpable hit.
Justin: Oh my god, if you guys know the rules to D&D that well, this must be very frustrating for you. I’m just now realizing–
Griffin: [keeps getting interrupted/crosstalk with his brothers] That is- That is-
Travis: Did you guys just get really excited when we asked? Like “Thank you, it’s a hit. [exhales heavily] Oh god, I’ve just been sitting here–”
Griffin: That’s 20 points of ice damage as you are pierced by this ice lance. And as it hits you, the snowman pounds his hand down and another ice lance appears in his hand.
Taako: Hey, be careful, if you kill him, you’re Santa.
[audience and Griffin laughing]
Griffin: Taako, you’re up next.
Justin: Ah, good, so who do we have up still?
Griffin: Uh, the carrot-faced snowman.
Justin: In the interest of moving things along, I’m going to throw a snowball.
Griffin: OK.
Justin: At the carrot-faced snowman.
Griffin: Roll really good.
Justin: K, that is a 15.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s a hit.
Justin: OK, good.
Griffin: Roll a d10 plus your, uh... I guess your attack modifi- I don’t know what that is. Just do your spellcasting modifier. [crosstalk] It’s a magically delicious snowball.
Justin: [crosstalk] I’m pretending it’s- yeah- That is a... 5 plus my spellcasting modifier of 5. So that’s a 10.
Griffin: That’s enough to take down the carrot-faced snowman.
Justin: Hell yes.
[audience cheers]
{0:35:08}
Clint: Nice job, buddy.
Griffin: As the last skeleton falls, the ice–
Justin: [crosstalk] Who- who was that? Who said that to me?
Clint: That was-that was me.
Justin: [crosstalk] Did I hear that voice–
Clint: [crosstalk] You’re my buddy!
Travis: [crosstalk] That was Dad, talking to you, Justin.
Justin: Ok, thank you.
Clint: Nice job, buddy!
Justin: Thank you, Dad, human dad, my dad, Justin McElroy’s dad, Clinton.
Griffin: As the last skeleton falls, the ice door you watched the three aarakocra pass through earlier slides open, granting you access deeper into the Icekeep.
Travis: We do that.
Griffin: You proceed down another frozen cobblestone tunnel, and as you go further, you hear another noise on top of the constant low crying that’s coming from the depths of the Icekeep. You actually hear another voice, only this one’s panicked and screaming–
Travis: [singing] I like to [starts laughing]
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: [laughing] What? It’s screaming like it’s in pain, like I am, me, Griffin, right now. [audience laughter] And it’s screaming from the chamber just ahead of you. What do you do?
Travis: I rush in!
Griffin: Yup. Uh, you rush into the chamber at the end of the hall so fast that Justin’s hat falls off. And you find yourself–
Clint: Whose hat?
Justin: It’s hard because if I put it on well enough, the people in the balcony don’t get what they paid for.
Griffin: It’s true. We’ll go hat– we’ll go hat-free for act two.
[audience cheering]
Clint: Wait, before you rush in, could I cast–
Travis: That’s not how rush in works!
Clint: [somewhat dubiously/passive-aggressively] Oookay!
Griffin: What did you want to cast?
Travis: Were you going to cast something helpful?
Clint: I cast Mass Healing Word on me and Taako.
Griffin: Ok. You all are–
Travis: Taako has not been hurt.
Justin: No, but thank you, that puts a spring in my step and some vim in my vigor, being healed at maximum hit points. [Clint laughing] Mmm! Like drinking a frosty Coca-Cola, your healing spell washes over me and gives me the spring in my step!
Griffin: You rush into the chamber at the end of the hall and you find yourself in a small stone carved room lit by braziers in each corner. Scattered around the floor are toys of enormous proportion, they are huge toys, and almost all of them have been smashed to pieces. You see the remnants of several clockwork soldiers that have been reduced to scraps by some vicious melee attacks. You see several large stuffed animals that have just been eviscerated, their cotton stuffing pouring out onto the floor. And you also see what looks like a, like a jack-in-the-box. It’s smaller than the other toys, it’s about one foot tall with a spring mounted figurine, uh, and that figurine actually looks like a woman wearing fencing gear. She’s holding a cutlass, and she’s bouncing frantically up and down because the box that she’s mounted in is aflame. And she seems distressed.
Travis: I put it out.
{37:45}
Griffin: Hooooooow?
Travis: With my…
Griffin: Breath? Hands?
Travis: Um… what do I have?
Justin: Just fuckin’ empty your f– You got a canteen you bring on your adventures.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, is it so much I can’t pour a canteen on?
Griffin: [high pitched, incredulous] No, it’s a small toy that’s on fire!
Travis: I put a– put a canteen on there!
Clint: You’re surrounded by snow!
Griffin: You dump your canteen out on this toy–
Justin: Now he’s a problem solver!
Griffin: [laughs] You dump your canteen out on this toy, and she breathes a sigh of relief, kind of–
Magnus: Are you ok?
Griffin: She assesses the damage, uh, done to her, and she says, uh… what does she sound like? Uh…
Travis: [laughs] That’s a good question, Griffin, I think she’s sounds a little something like this!
Clint: Does she say [affected voice] “Nobody wants a Charlie-in-the-Box!” [audience cheers]
Justin: You’ll do a character voice for that!
{38:36}
Clint: [crosstalk] I’m done.
Griffin: [crosstalk] She says, um, she says,
Jack-in-the-Box: [using a Southern accent] Thanks! I’m Bertha. Well, I’m a Bladed Bertha, that’s what my toy line’s called, [Magnus: Yeah.] but I just go by Bertha for sheort– for short. What– sorry I said that so weird, I’m real nervous. What’s y’all’s handles?
Magnus: We don’t have handles, we’re human.
Taako: You can call me Taako, or Taak for shuuuuurt.
Magnus: They call me Big Dog!
Merle: [in a drawn out, hearty accent] And I’m Santa Claus!
Bertha: Hey, I’ve heard of you!
Griffin: She says,
Bertha: Well, welcome to the chamber of misfit toys. Folks brought us– folks brought us from all around the world to try to appease the young master here, but it doesn’t look like he took to us, does it?
Magnus: Nah, ‘cause you’re misfit toys– maybe they brought good toys! [audience groans] I mean, listen, I’m not being a jerk, I’m just saying!
Griffin: She actually sinks back down into the box and the lid slams shut.
Magnus: Listen, Bertha– can I call you Bertha?
Bertha: [muffled] No.
Magnus: Bertha, I– I’m an idiot, and I–
Merle: [in his Santa voice] Yes, he is!
Magnus: Merle, could you not?
Merle: [in his Santa voice] Who’s Merle?
Magnus: Jesus Christ.
Merle: Who’s Je– oh, I know him.
[Griffin laughing]
{39:55}
Travis: [crosstalk] You do?
Justin: [crosstalk] Bitter– your, your–
Merle: [crosstalk] Happy birthday!
Griffin: Expanding the Santa lore pretty significantly right now!
Justin: Your bitter enemy, Jesus!
Magnus: Listen, I– Bertha. Bertha, please come back.
Griffin: She– the lid opens up, and she kind of reluctantly pops up. She says,
Bertha: That’s fine. Y’all are kinda mean. Are you here with those super mean ducks that came through here earlier?
Magnus: No, fuck a duck.
Bertha: They broke most of us, and set me on fire. I hope they get what’s coming to them!
Magnus: Why would they do that?
Taako: I have a feeling they will.
Griffin: Uh, she says,
Bertha: Hey, y’all want–
Griffin: She starts bouncing up and down on her spring excitedly now,
Bertha: Hey, y’all wanna duel real quick?
Griffin: And then she, uh, [crosstalk] her–
Magnus: [crosstalk] Nooo.
Griffin: This light surrounds her and suddenly Taako, you’re holding a cutlass that matches the one that she has. It’s made of sturdy metal, but you can tell that the blade is pretty dull. After all, it’s a child’s toy. And as it appears in your hand, Bertha’s just bouncing around, flailing her cutlass, saying,
Bertha: En guarde, you bastard, have at you!
Justin: So wait, it’s a child’s toy?
Griffin: Yeah, it’s like a fun dueling toy.
Justin: “Hey, fuck-o, c’mon!” Uh, ok, I make a melee attack, my first ever. 5. Is that good or bad for melee attacks?
Griffin: She knocks your attack out of the way and jabs you [crosstalk] in the tummy.
Justin: [crosstalk] Fair enough.
Travis: [crosstalk] And you’re dead!
Griffin: Uh, no, it doesn’t do any damage, it’s a very blunt blade. She kinda laughs and sheathes her blade, and as she does yours disappears, and she says,
Bertha: So what brings y’all to Icekeep? If you’re here to kill the master, then unfortunately I gotta fight you.
Magnus: No! We wanna make the master happy! Right now master is sad.
Bertha: How’re you gonna do that?
Magnus: I don’t know. He’s Santa, he’s got toys or some shit.
Griffin: She says, uh, Bertha says,
Bertha: So, uh, you’re gonna give a present to the master? Whew! I’m glad I’m not in your shoes, he’s a tough–
Magnus: [crosstalk] Do you wanna come with us?
Bertha: He’s a tough nut to crack.
Griffin: He says– she says, uh,
Bertha: I’ll tell you what, yeah, why don’t you take me with you? I can maybe help you out. My master is a frost ogre, and his name’s Jimmy.
Magnus: What is it?
Bertha: Jimmy.
Magnus: Jimmy?
Bertha: Jimmy.
Magnus: Like, J-I-M-M-Y?
Bertha: That’s his Christian name, yeah. [crosstalk] Honestly–
Justin: [crosstalk] He’s a Christi–
Merle: [crosstalk] [Santa voice] Ah, we’re back to Christ again!
Magnus: Just to double check, it’s a frost ogre? Jimmy the frost ogre?
Bertha: Honestly, he’s really not that bad, he just– he doesn’t seem to care for toys, though, so keep that in mind if you’re trying to think of the right present. Though, if– if– so if I were you, I’d think, uh, re-think giving a ball and cup or a hula hoop or something. Anyway, you take me with you, maybe I can help keep Jimmy calm while you’re trying to figure out the perfect present. What do you say?
Merle: And you’re a toy, right?
Bertha: I’m a very good toy.
Magnus: Once again, uh, how about, uh, I’ll tell you what. We’ll– I’ll trade you your blunt cutlass for this rapier so you can actually help us in a fight.
Bertha: Unfortunately this is the only one I can use.
Griffin: She says–
Magnus: [crosstalk] You have two hands–
Clint: [crosstalk] And it’s probably soldered into her hand, too.
Bertha: [crosstalk] Yeah, unfortunately in this–
Magnus: [crosstalk] You have two hands, don’t you?
Bertha: Yeah, but it doesn’t open, I’m a toy. [Griffin laughing] I’m not gonna– I’m not fuckin’ Sephiroth over here, I’m a toy, dude!
Magnus: All, right, well, come on, you come with me, and I–
Travis: How big is it?
Griffin: Uh, like, just one foot tall, you can kind of–
Travis: I pick up the box–
Magnus: Yeah, come on.
Griffin: Ok. Uh, so another ice door in front of you slides open, revealing a staircase leading upward to Jimmy’s chambers. And as you–
Travis: Jimbers!
Griffin: The Jimbers. And as you ascend, that shrieking cry you’ve heard this whole time is almost unbearably loud and it’s rattling the walls with each wail.
Travis: [crosstalk] To be fair, the screaming from, from the room ahead of us–
Griffin: It’s not really screaming, [crosstalk] it’s like crying–
Travis: [crosstalk] No, no, but you said there was a screaming–
Griffin: It was her on fire.
Travis: It was her on fire. Oh.
Griffin: Yeah, she was upset about that. Um, the air is getting colder as you approach Jimmy’s chambers, blowing at you in squalls with each cry. And as you enter, you realise this chamber, Jimmy’s main hang zone, is a huge space–
Travis: Chill zone, please, Griffin, chill zone.
Griffin: His chill zone, uh, is magically eroded in the center of this glacier. Deep within the frozen walls of this room, you see enormous blue lights just swirling around in the ice, casting refractions of their light into the room. It’s a big empty space, about 200 feet long and 90 feet wide, and at the opposite end of the room you see Jimmy.
He’s a massive blue ogre. He’s 25 feet tall at least, but despite his size, there’s something undeniably child-like about him. He’s wearing these bright green shorts and a red t-shirt that doesn’t entirely cover his belly, and that shirt is emblazoned with a Candlenights tree. And he’s just uncontrollably crying, and these big fat tears are dripping slowly off his face and each time one hits the floor, a ripple of light spreads out across the room, polishing the floor which you can recognise is just perfectly smooth, a shiny sheet of ice. And Jimmy doesn’t notice you entered, nor does he notice the other people in the room – the three aarakocra who are walking menacingly towards Jimmy, until they hear you enter, at which point they turn towards you. And the big armored one says,
Armored Aarakocra: Heh, looks like they caught up with us after all.
And the robed magic user one says,
Magic Aarakocra: Oh, what are we gonna do? We’re so close!
And the roguish looking one says,
Rogue Aarakocra: What did I tell you, Ray? We’re gonna ice these clowns.
Travis: I’ll tell you what-
Justin: Can we use fire stuff yet or...? [Griffin: Yeah] OK, thank you.
Travis: I also– what I want to do.
Griffin: Just say it. Just say something. Just say any–
Travis: I want to take some of my metal thieves’ tools…
Griffin: [slightly wary of the situation] Okay…
Travis: And using some various bits of rope, strap them to the bottoms of my shoes. Make some ice skatessssssss. [audience cheers]
Justin: OK, so the bad guys look at us, right? And then we’re like “Guys, quick! Something, we gotta think of it!” And Magnus, like, “Hold on.”
Travis: Gotta lace up!
Justin: Gotta lace up my magic skates.
Travis: Quack.
Griffin: As you do–
Travis: QUACK. QUACK.
Griffin: As you do that…
Justin: They kill you.
[Griffin and Clint laugh]
Griffin: Bladed Bertha begins to glow as she sees what you’re doing, Magnus, and you f- you see her start to glow again. And Taako and Merle, around your boots, something’s happening. You realize that two cutlasses have appeared on the bottoms of your shoes, also giving you skates. For ice. And the three of you stand up, and before, when you walked into this room you were losing your footing, but now you’re- you’re graceful as swans. And you see the three aarakocra, you can now see their legs as they’re sort of moving towards you, and they have these webbed duck feet as they are coming closer and closer towards you, but they see that now you’re standing, that you’ve cancelled out their evolutionary advantage, standing on your iced skates. And the big aarakocra, still charging at you, says
Armored Aarakocra: What is this witchcraft?
Travis: And I point at him and say
Magnus: I’m gonna duck you up.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s good enough. We’re going to take intermission right there. We’ll be right back [audience cheers and the jingling sleigh bells from the Poem Background Music play as we transition into the ad block]
{Ad block: 0:47:12-0:51:12}
Griffin: Alright, I’m going to use your initiative rolls from the last battle. Which means Taako, you’re going first. Just to set the stage: you all are in literally a big hockey rink or ice skating rink. Essentially, depending on whether you want to go more of a Mighty Ducks or a Yuri!!! on Ice route with this fight. [audience cheers loudly] I will support–
Travis: I love that– Listen, can I tell you why I love this crowd? Mighty Ducks? Silenceeee. Yuri!!! on Ice? YEAAAAAAAAH! I’ve never seen a clearer separation of “no, not that, YES THAT!”.
Griffin: So Taako, you’re going first. You are all on ice skates and the three aarakocra are on ice skates. One of them is big and armored, one of them’s sort of roguish with two daggers, and one of them is a smaller spellcaster. And they are fighting you. In a fight.
Justin: Hehe. Um, OK, uh–
Travis: Wait, where’d that hair come from?
Justin: I took off my hat, this is the hair that’s underneath it.
Griffin: That’s just what Justin looks like.
Clint: Just- just le it back a little bit, because you do your acting with your eyes. Son.
Griffin: That’s a good point. [audience cheers] Fucking, Justin’s on some Harry Styles shit.
Justin: Um– okay-
Clint: Who?
Justin: Just ‘cause I’ll never get another opportunity to do anything this amazing again, uh,
Taako: [not in character voice, but probably in character] Hey, Bertha.
Bertha: Uh, yeah?
Taako: Can you make four more blades?
[audience loses their minds]
Bertha: I can– I can make as many blades as ya need.
Taako: That’s the right answer.
Justin: I cast Phantom Steed.
Travis: [laughingly] Wait, so you guys know about this?
Griffin: Your- you extend your staff and Garyl springs forward–
Travis: Wait, you’re assuming, maybe it’s a different steed.
Justin: Nonono, there’s my steed. It’s Garyl.
Griffin: Garyl springs forth from your staff, and for a moment he lands on the ice and his legs just go all over. And he’s just like,
Garyl: Yo, why did you bring me here?
Griffin: And then Bertha glows and suddenly… Garyl’s wearing four ice skates, and is still a little bit- still a horse. So still a little bit like,
Garyl: Not much better
Justin: [cross talk] Wait, technically
Travis: Wait, I know how to fix this.
Magnus: Garyl, I think you’re cute.
Travis: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Thinks they’re cute, then they can fly.
Justin: And he’s a binicorn. I mean, I don’t want to– he’s not a horse, he’s a binicorn.
Griffin: Actually, the light forms around Merle’s Santa suit again, and it actually hits Garyl, and now suddenly, Garyl’s fur is this dark brown. His long tail extends to sort of a bushy ball, and his two horns are now glowing bright red.
Clint: And I say,
Merle: Garyl with your horns so bright, won’t you bite this fight tonight?
Justin: OK. When I-
Travis: Now, to be fair, he did say “bite this fight”.
Justin: When I cast- when I cast it, I cast it in the direction of them and hopped on, so I was hoping to just kind of tumble–
Griffin: Charge them? Yeah, sure.
Justin: Sort of tumble into ‘em.
Griffin: Sure, roll a d20 plus your spellcasting.
Justin: That’s a 19.
Griffin: Uh, yeah, that’s definitely going to hit, not the armored one- actually that might hit any of them. Who do you want to hit with Charging Garyl?
Justin: Uh…
Griffin: The armored one, the rogue, or the spellcaster?
Justin: The spellcaster.
[Clint and Travis agree]
Griffin: OK, yeah. Uh, yeah, that is a hit, go ahead and roll, eeeeh, we’ll say 2d10. Plus your spellcasting modifier. Oh, he found his dice. Finally. [Justin: Thank you] They were on the drink cart.
Justin: Yeah, I do. Uh, that’s a 7, plus 3, so 10.
Griffin: 10 plus your spellcasting modifier.
Justin: 15.
Griffin: You’re 15? OK, you uh, pierce into Ray, the magic-wielding duck. And he gets knocked up into the air–
Travis: He gets knocked up? [Griffin laughing]
Clint: That’s a potent spell!
Justin: Finally, my Tumblr fanfiction is coming to fruition.
Travis: And then Taako said “Hey, duck. What’s up duck?”
Griffin: Uh, gets knocked up into the air. And as it gets knocked up into the air, two beams shoot out of Garyl’s horns and blast it also in the air for another 9 points of damage [Justin: Whoa] as these two heat rays shoot out of Garyl’s bright red horns.
Justin: And Garyl says,
Garyl: “Ho ho ho, now I have two horns”
Justin: Because Die Hard?
Griffin: Everyone gets one of those, yes. OK, n–
Justin: Still not a Christmas movie, but it’s fun.
Griffin: Oh, we can’t fucking do this on a stage in front of–
Clint: It is a Christmas movie!
Travis: [crosstalk] Hey, fuck you. It’s not a Christmas movie... Is Batman Returns a Christmas movie?
Griffin: [sings about how they can’t do this on stage]
Justin: [crosstalk] Griffin please, just 30 seconds, just 30 seconds, OK? It’s- OK. It’s, OK, it’s–
Clint: Go ahead.
Justin: If you’re not timing it, then it’s [stutters] it’s not a Christmas movie. It’s set at Christmas, but it’s not a Christmas– Like, lots of movies– [someone in the audience yells ”It’s a Christmas movie!”] No, it’s not. It’s not thematically related to Christmas, it’s just set at Christmas-
Travis: It could happen on Arbor Day–
Justin: And Christmas is not thematically related… OK, good.
Griffin: Time. Time. End of discussion. Next in the order–
Clint: Is Nightmare Before Christmas a Christmas movie?
Travis: Yes!
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Fucking… come on. Magnus you’re up-
Travis: And it’s also a Halloween movie.
Clint: OK. Wow.
Griffin: [with an infinite amount of patience] That was the last diversion.
Travis: I’m gonna charge the cake-eater.
Griffin: There’s a curse.
Travis: I’mma charge. The cake-eater.
Griffin: I don’t know what that means.
Travis: The cake-eater, it’s the big beefy one. You told me I could make Mighty Ducks references. [audience cheers]
Justin: OK, then you would say “I’m gonna charge the bash brother”, because he is the one–
Travis: Nonononono.
Justin: Cake-eater was the handsome boy. He was the Matchbox–
Travis: No, no, no–
Griffin: I literally said that was the last divergence. And that–
Clint: But that doesn’t make it true!
Justin: Cake-eater was the Matchbox 20 lookin’ motherfucker. It wasn’t the big burly one.
Travis: He was NINE, who’d he look like? Was there a nine year old in Matchbox 20?
Justin: It was Joshua Jackson who looks like Rob Thomas.
Travis: No, Joshua Jackson was the main one who was the leader of the–
Griffin: A black fog- A black fog spreads throughout the ice rink, and it’s a curse! And the curse is this: “the next time you aaaaaall get off-topic while playing Dungeons and Dragons, your character will befall a terrible fate. I’m- [audience laughs] I’m not joking.”
Travis: OK, with an unarmed charge– no, no, no, Phantom Fist charge, Phantom Fist charge– [someone in the audience says something indistinguishable] Hell yes, [Clint: Hell yeah!] audience member. I rolled a 15 plus uh, 8.
Griffin: Yes, that’s a hit on the armored duck.
Travis: OK, that’s 1d4–
Griffin: You’re just punching him?
Travis: Yeah, well, with a push.
Griffin: OK, so you’re checking them, to use–
Travis: Well it’s only 1, so that’s 5 points of damage.
Griffin: Great.
Travis: Ho ho ho, I have two attacks.
Griffin: OK, so that’s Travis’.
Travis: Thank you. Then I’m gonna throw Chance Lance at them as they stumble back.
Griffin: OK.
Travis: That’s a 16 plus 8, 24.
Griffin: That’s definitely a hit.
Travis: Oh, excuse me, [Griffin: It’s a hit] it’s a 25
Griffin: Oh, that’s a Super Hit.
Clint: So it’s a [Street Fighter voice] HIIIIIIT. {0:58:58}
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And that’s 1d10… That’s a one. PLUS, plus 5. Six.
Griffin: OK.
Travis: So that’s 11 and then–
Griffin: Both Ray and the armored duck are looking kinda not great.
Travis: And I’m going to use my Action Surge to attack again.
Griffin: With what?
Travis: Uh, the Raging Flaming Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Clint: You want to tell your story now?
Travis: I do. So, I have a really, really incredibly beautiful hand-ma–
Clint: We don’t have it yet.
Travis: No, here’s the thing…
Griffin: Please do not expect Travis just to lift it up from under the table.
Travis: No. A shipping company who shall remain nameless failed to get– I said [mumbles] it’ll remain nameless.
Justin: But it’s not Fed-Ex and it’s not America.
Travis: But it’s not Fed-Ex and it’s not the United States Postal Service– fucked up real bad so it’s not here. BUT I wa–
Justin: If you live in Kentucky, know that the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom is nearby!
Travis: [crosstalk]
Griffin: It’s treasure, hidden in a UPS dungeon–
Travis: But I knew I– YOU SAID THE NAME.
Clint: “Shall remain!”
Griffin: They fucking know who it is.
Travis: No, that’s short for Upsy. I want to give a big shout-out to Lauren and Grant, who fucking worked their asses off to try to get it here, including flying from LA to Seattle to try to physically go to the place and bring it, only to find out it wasn’t there.
Justin: Grant of Mythbusters fame, also of “being a super solid dude” fame.
Travis: Yeah, Grant Imahara? Apparently, the best.
Justin: The best.
Griffin: Thank you to both of you.
Travis: But also Lauren, Lauren who made the sword is the best. And then I’m going to attack with the Raging Flaming Poisoning Sword of Doom. Well that’s a 5, BUT, plus a nine.
Griffin: That’s a hit. I’ve decided.
Travis: Hey, thanks.
Griffin: On the armored duck?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Are you sure? [out of the side of his mouth] Oooh, ya sure that’s who it’s attacking? Because that might not hit the armored duck.
Travis: I’m gonna hit the rogue one.
Griffin: Eyyy, it’s a hit!
Travis: And I believe that’s this plus a bunch? I don’t have that one. That’s a 6, plus 5, 11, plus like what, 42?
Audience Member: 20!
Griffin: It’s plus 20.
Clint: Thank you, commissioner.
Travis: So that’ll be 31.
Griffin: OK. So the armored duck– er, the rogue duck is now looking very bad.
Travis: And I’m going to, because I have an extra attack, I’ll use my other attack–
Clint: Good god.
Travis: I only get to do this!
Clint: Yeah, but you do it over and over and over.
Travis: I don’t do anything. I rolled a 1. That was a 1. I think about attacking, but then I remember a time someone made fun of me when I was a child.
Griffin: Is there any flavor to your attacks, or are you just sort of on ice skates, flailing a big sword around?
Travis: Griffin–
Griffin: I want that flavor.
Travis: I am skating like a– I don’t know, what’s a really good skating animal?
Griffin: Alright, we’re moving on.
Travis: A penguin! Like a penguin! Like a Snoopy. I’m skating like a– That’s the thing, you look at me and go “oh, he’s a great– Oh, he sliced that guy”. But you don’t see the attack coming, because surprisingly–
Griffin: So lovely.
Travis: Magnus is fucking graceful on the ice.
Griffin: Yeah, sure. Uh, next–
Travis: LIKE… [quietly] no.
Griffin: Next in the order is Ray, the magic duck who’s not looking very good.
Travis: What a weird sentence.
Griffin: Ray the magic duck– uh, uh, they-
Clint: Beloved Christmas character.
Griffin: Lifts their staff into the air and casts Haste on the rogue. Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 to AC, and it has advantage on dexterity saving throw, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. So you see this light surround the leather armor-clad duck with the two knives, and suddenly they are skating like a bullet. Aaaall around the rink, doing laps and beautiful jumps, pirouettes, axels… [Griffin runs out of ice skating words to throw in here as he trips over an “l” sound a few times]
Clint: Stuff.
Travis: No no no, let him keep going.
Griffin: A toe loop. [audience cheers]
Clint: You’re not leaving anything else for the rest of us.
Griffin: Yeah, uh, and they are actually up next. And they are going to come after… Let’s see, who attacked the rogue duck? It was Magnus. Yeah. OK, they are going to come at you and they are going to take two attacks with these big, gnarly knives. One is a [high pitched] critical hit.
Travis: Oh?
Griffin: And one is a 17 versus AC?
Travis: Wait, what is it?
Griffin: Seventeen.
Travis: Yeah, that was a miss. [one audience member yells “Yeah”] Yeaaaaah.
Griffin: Critical hits going to be–
Travis: I know, I was checking– Hold on, I was checking my list of things I could do. I’m not just like, on Twitter. “Hey guys, so, playing D&D. What are you guys doing?”
Griffin: The crit is 36 points of damage.
Travis: Wait, it critted on me?
Griffin: Yes. Uh, next in the order iiiiiis… Merle. Santa.
Clint: Ahhhh. Alright.
Justin: Are there any truths that they possess [Griffin laughs] that we need to extract from them?
Clint: Merle does a Hamill Camel.
Griffin: What’s that?
Clint: That’s something Dorothy Hamill used to do. I-I don’t know, she spun around and carried water on her back. I don’t know exactly what it was.
Griffin: [laughing] Sure.
Clint: And, stay with me, give me a second, give me–
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh fuck.
Travis: [crosstalk] God damn That’s the most ominous like, scary thing.
Griffin: That’s very ominous. Careful of the black fog.
Clint: He casts Planar Ally. And summons– wait, wait– and summons Gundren with the Phoenix Fire Gauntlet. [A cacophony from the audience, some people cheering, some people shouting incredulously]
Travis: Right now, people at home, the silence you hear is me, Justin, and Griffin wondering if it’s either a “fuck you” or a “that’s the most competent thing our father… has ever done… in his whole life”.
Justin: OK.
Griffin: Alright, here’s what I-
Clint: [crosstalk] Cause I obviously failed as a parent.
Griffin: No, no-
Travis: Well, yeah.
Griffin: Yikes.
Travis: Your sons play D&D for a living, get your shit together, dad.
Justin: Alright, it’s definitely-
Griffin: [crosstalk] Here’s what we do-
Justin: It’s definitely the first one because he’s dead [crosstalk] and we took the gauntlet from him...
Griffin: [crosstalk] No no no no no, here’s what I’ll do with this.
Justin: Ok
Griffin: But I’ll need a- I’ll need a roll, and now we’re just playing fucking Calvinball folks.
Travis: [crosstalk] Because we’re on a time limit.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Not yet, not yet, not yet! ‘Cause I wanna explain what it is, what I’m envisioning for this scene.
Travis: Ok.
Griffin: [laughing] Interior: day.
Travis: Smash cut!
Griffin: I think you cast this spell and you specifically pull him from the moment of Old Phandalin’s destruction for, for, like, a tenth of a second. For like a tenth of a second, you just see this flash and suddenly in front of you, the smooth ice that you’re on turns to that smooth black glass of Phandalin. And it’s just like, it’s just like [snaps] that quick, but there is fire fucking everywhere in that second, and you catch the three birds in the flame. But I wanna- like, the strength of the projection is going to be based on your D20 roll plus spellcasting modifier and if it’s shitty… we’ll figure it out. [audience laughs]
Clint: Well, if it’s shitty, I’ll just lie.
Travis: No, you won’t.
Clint: By the way, folks, this scene is a, can be seen in the forthcoming graphic novel [crosstalk] from First Second.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Spoiler alert. Yeah, go to theadventurezonecomic.com and get our graphic novel, it’s-
Travis: Theadventurezonecomic.com, roll that shit!
Clint: Here we go.
Travis: Not bad, not bad. Fourteen?
Griffin: [exasperated] What did he say, four?
Travis: Fourteen.
Clint: [crosstalk] Teen, teen! Plus my… spellcasting modifier.
Travis: Well, plus 5.
Justin: Mine is 5, you can borrow it.
Travis: 19.
Clint: 19!
Griffin: Uhhhh yeah. That’s a number. And now-
Clint: No, wait a minute-
Travis: It’s actually plus 8.
Clint: Plus 8. So, it’s 22. [audience cheers]
Travis: So fuck off!
Clint: Ducks!
Griffin: Ok, with a 22 you-
Travis: Wait, hold on, hold on...
Clint: Oh I don’t like that.
Travis: No, say it, say it, say it. [someone in audience calls ‘say it’ as well]
Clint: Now I have 22 attacks, ho ho ho.
Griffin: Ok, now everyone’s used them up and we’re done!
Clint: What was that, by the way, what was that from?
Justin: It’s from Die Hard.
Griffin: [crosstalk] From fucking Die Hard! Uh oh, the black fog, be careful. Ok so- [Justin laughs] the rogue duck with the haste speeds dodges out of the way of the column of fire, but the armored duck and magic duck are both caught up in it. With that, the magic duck is incinerated [Justin: Oh shit!] in a flash and is gone.
Clint: Crispy Duck!
Griffin: [laughs but continues] The armored duck is looking-
Travis: Hold on-
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, it was good, it was good.
Clint: [crosstalk] Wait a minute, crispy duck!
Travis: That was really good. [audience cheers]
Griffin: The armored duck is looking like a stiff wind could probably knock them over and the rogue duck, who is still kinda bad off, got out of the way so it’s just the two of them. [someone blows into a their mic] And then, just as quickly as that, they’re gone. And another teardrop falls out of the ogre’s eye and as it hits the ground, the ice that was sort of melted by the fire is zambonied back into shape. Taa-ko...
Justin: Um, ok, I-
Griffin: You’re still on Garyl, your beautiful steed.
Justin: I’m on Garyl my beautiful steed and I race towards them, and I raise the Umbrastaff and I say
Taako: Bad news, idiots! I know how the podcast ends and we can’t die.
Justin: And I cast-
Griffin: Just to set it up, the poem did establish that this takes place after everything else that’s happened in the podcast.
Travis: Oh really? It takes place after- spoiler alert-
Justin: No, wait, don’t do it ‘cause-
Griffin: [laughs loudly] Ok, no, Travis- Justin’s right, ok, I take it back.
Justin: I cast Delayed Blast Fireball.
Griffin: [total confusion] What?
Justin: We alls fucked now. [everyone laughs] A beam of yellow light flashes from my hand and I-
Travis: I’m glad you said hand.
Justin: Yeah. The bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the explosion of flame must make a dexterity saving throw. If you don’t save, it goes bad. And you’re gonna- we’ll see, we’ll just do the dexterity saving throw now.
Griffin: Ok. So, the hastened rogue duck has advantage on dexterity saving throws.
Justin: I just wanna confirm though that we’re far enough away from Jimmy that this is not going to-
Griffin: No, Jimmy is still very, very far away.
Justin: Thank you.
Griffin: The magic duck rolled a five… Oh, the magic duck’s dead, the armored duck rolled a five. And the rogue duck, critical miss, and a 21 versus AC, or whatever the-
Justin: It’s a dexterity saving throw, so-
Griffin: It’s against your spellcasting save.
Justin: Which is 18. You guys should roll, too.
Travis: It’s a 4.
Griffin: Merle, roll that d20. You are saving the-
Justin: I need to start rolling my d6 now ‘cause if I don’t start now I won’t be done.
Griffin: Here, we’ll do this, we’ll just roll the d6 once and multiply by the number of dice.
Justin: Well, that’s not how numbers work.
Griffin: [exasperated] Ok, then start rolling it.
Justin: Don’t you have a computer program that can roll?
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Justin: Ok, it’s 12d6. [audience freaks out]
Travis: I… I’m gonna use parry. [Justin dies laughing]
Clint: Which one of the ducks is that?
Travis: I think since we’re so good on our skates we should get advantage on that roll, Griffin.
Griffin: Ok, no! Uh, Merle, what-
Travis: You did say ok first.
Griffin: Merle, what did you get?
Clint: I rolled a 19.
Justin: Hell yeah, dude!
Griffin: Ok, Merle saves. Uh, you see Merle leaping gracefully from the explosion as both of the armored folks are caught up and hit for 36 points of fire damage.
Travis: Oh, no, I’m fine.
Griffin: Ok. That is enough to also incinerate the armored duck, leaving just the rogue duck.
Travis: I’m down to 41, I’m doing fine. 41, that’s still better than most of you have.
Griffin: Yeah!
Justin: Oh wait, hold on, I should roll mine. Yeah, it’s fine.
Travis: You don’t hit yourself.
Justin: I don’t think I’d hit myself, would I? No, probably not. Doesn’t make sense.
Griffin: No, I mean you’re aiming it- yeah, yeah, I’ll give it to you.
Justin: Aiming it exactly 21 feet away? For sure. For sure, for sure, for sure.
Clint: And you’ve got that spell shaping thing too, right?
Justin: Absolutely, thank you, Clinton. Yes, spell shaping, so important.
Griffin: Next up is the- rogue-
Travis: [crosstalk] Is me.
Griffin: [in dread] ...It is. Uh oh. You’re gonna hurt ‘em.
{{1:12:48}}
Travis: I’m going to aim Chance Lance at the rogue.
Griffin: [crosstalk] They’re going very fast. Ok.
Travis: And then I’m going to aim about two feet in front of them.
Griffin: Alright. Take advantage on that because you’re leading your target.
Travis: Yeah, ok. That was a 23.
Griffin: Yup, that’ll do it.
Travis: Duck Hunt, baby.
Griffin: Roll your damage.
Travis: It’s an 8 plus 5. 13.
Griffin: Here’s the scene: that rogue duck jumps out of the way of Taako’s explosion and then turns on its heels and does that cool thing where the ice shoots up, and then just started using its haste to sprint towards Jimmy. And as it was going, you calculated using, let me see, the fucking [Travis: No, I guessed] arithmetic fall and spread out of Magnus’ brain and you throw the lance and- oh wait, now we have another great line.
{{1:13:31}}
Magnus: Take a gander at that!
Griffin: [chuckling] Okay.
[audience cheers]
Clint: We’re even, right?
Griffin: Yeah, you’re even. The duck was very, very far away as you threw Chance Lance at it.
Travis: And I mumbled that line. [mutters under his breath]
Griffin: And you just kind of see it far away, its tiny form just kind of [plop sound effect] fall over dead. And you have solved my duck puzzle.
Travis: Yeah! [audience cheers]
Griffin: And with that, as the last of the aarakocra go down, finally Jimmy in the back of the room sees all the combat from afar, and he seems really upset that there’s all this fighting happening in his bedroom, essentially, and tears are just streaming off his face, sending these constant ripples across the surface of the ice. And the wailing is so loud now that the room is shaking and above you, you hear the ice start to crack in these deep booms.
Travis: It’s gonna be ok.
Griffin: You don’t have long to- please don’t fucking disarm the drama and tension of the situation. Jimmy sees the three of you skate towards him with Bertha bouncing as Magnus, I guess, has it strapped to your back, fucking-
Travis: It’s on my shoulder like a parrot.
Griffin: Yoda style.
Travis: [affronted] No.
Griffin: And Jimmy looks down and looks at the three of you and Jimmy says,
Jimmy: [deep, sad voice] Santa? Is that-
Travis: My pebbles! [audience laughs]
Jimmy: Is that really you?
Merle: [deep Santa voice] Hello, Jimmy.
Jimmy: Santa, why haven’t you-
Justin: [impersonating Clint’s Santa voice] I’m Johnny Cash!
{1:15:22}
Clint: [Johnny Cash voice] Hello, Jimmy.
Griffin: He says-
Clint: [sings] Love is a burning thing. [audience cheers]
Travis: That was really good.
Clint: Thank you.
Griffin: Jimmy says
Jimmy: Why haven’t you visited me? I’ve been a really good boy.
[audience aws]
Clint: Santa casts Zone of Truth. [audience cheers]
Justin: Have you been a good boy? Let’s find out.
Griffin: That’s a 12. Everybody else roll too, we’re doing this fucking thing.
Clint: That’s a 3. Ok.
Merle: Yes Jimmy, I am Santa Claus.
Travis: That wasn’t the question. [Griffin laughs loudly] The question-
Clint: Yes, it was!
Travis: No, the question is “why didn’t you bring me anything?” You’re just like “yeah, I’m Santa.”
Jimmy: [crosstalk] Why didn’t you bring me any presents, Santa?
Merle: Well Jimmy, I tried to get in, but your fucking door was locked [Griffin laughs, audience cheers] and you don’t have a chimney.
Jimmy: It’s true, I live in an iceberg. I thought that was it.
Merle: No, Jimmy, Santa has always loved you. Now-
Travis: Wait, hold on, you’re in Zone of Truth. Santa did say in his list that he was afraid of this place.
Clint: [still using Santa voice] But you can love things and be afraid of them, son. [audience cheers]
Griffin: What does that even mean?
Justin: I know what it means. [Griffin laughs]
Griffin: Jimmy says,
Jimmy: Well, did you bring me a present?
Merle: Well Jimmy, I can give you a present, but I need to know what would make you happier than anything in the whole-
Jimmy: I’m a little kid, I don’t know. I’m just-
Travis: Fuck off
Jimmy: I don’t know what- I don’t know. I haven’t been happy in awhile, I’m just so lonely down here.
Justin: [realization] Oh.
Merle: Jimmy, maybe true happiness lies within. Maybe- go with me here, go with me. Jimmy, maybe true happiness is not something you find wrapped up in a gift.
Travis: Fuck that, come here.
Clint: Ok.
Jimmy: [cries] Why’re you taking so long?
Merle: I can give you anything. How would you like… a friend?
Jimmy: A real friend?
Merle: A real friend. A little boy, just like you.
Clint: And I open the bag [Griffin laughs loudly] and a little hand reaches out with a magnifying glass in it. [audience cheers] And he says, “Happy Hanukkah, sirs!” [more audience cheering]
Griffin: Angus McDonald appears from the bag, I guess, and immediately starts slipping on the ice, immediately starts shivering, extremely cold. He’s in his pajamas-
Travis: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Griffin: And he says
Angus: [distressed and confused] What’s going on? Where am I? I’m so cold, everything's cold.
Travis: I give him the feathered cuirass and say
Magnus: Suck it up. Get your shit together, kid.
Griffin: And Jimmy looks at Angus and says
Jimmy: Hello. Do you want to be my friend?
Griffin: And Angus looks around the room at the fact that he’s in the middle of a glacier, in the middle of a dungeon, and sees you three with battle wounds, and three dead ducks on the floor, and the 25 foot ogre standing in front of him. And we see the arithmetic form around Angus’s brain as he says,
Angus: [hesitant] Yes.
Travis: If I may, can Magnus lean in and whisper to Angus?
Griffin: I guess.
Magnus: [whispered] Pen pals. Pen pals!
Angus: Excuse me, new friend, do you own a pen?
Griffin: And Jimmy says
Jimmy: No, I don’t.
Magnus: There’s plenty of feathers and quills around.
Griffin: And sure enough, Jimmy reaches down and plucks one of the feathers off of the dead duck in front of him.
Justin: He dips it in their blood. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: And you see Jimmy and Angus talking, and Jimmy realizes-
Travis: What’s your AOL, AIM?
Griffin: They trade screen — uh, usernames, and with this, Jimmy stops crying and he cheers. And as he cheers, the iceberg around you just explodes and the ice goes flying outwards, and suddenly all of you are standing out in the snow fields in the hills beyond Phandalin again. And as you are standing there, you realize that the raging snow storm has finally eased up. The clouds above have thinned, letting strands of bright moonlight pierce through, illuminating the slow, fluffy flakes floating lazily through the air [Clint starts to gently sing “Welcome Christmas”] with soft and lovely light. Over the hills, you can hear cheering as folks celebrate the quieting of the cry from the Icekeep and then, in the quiet of this gentle snow, you can hear those cheering voices start singing carols as they realize.
Clint: We don’t rehearse this stuff, folks!
Travis: No, we just all happen to share the same brain.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: We have one quarter of it each.
Justin: Believe it or not, we don’t rehearse. As hard as that must be for you to believe in this exact moment.
Griffin: The people of Phandalin are singing carols as they realize in unison that Candlenights is saved.
Travis: And it didn’t come in boxes...
Griffin: I actually have a poem to walk us out.
Justin: Wait, before we read the poem should we say thank you to everybody?
Griffin: We can do it after the poem, too.
Justin: It’s up to you, it’s your rodeo.
Travis: [crosstalk] Nah, let’s do it now.
Griffin: Thank you, everybody, for coming-
Justin: Yes, thank you Tacoma and Seattle, by extension ‘cause I know a lot of you came up.
Travis: No, you know what? Fuck Seattle.
Griffin: No, stop, we’re gonna be there all weekend- we will be there all weekend, Travis does not mean-
Justin: [crosstalk] Fuck Seattle!
Travis: [crosstalk] This is just for Tacoma!
Griffin: Thank you to the Pantages, this place is absolutely beautiful-
Travis: No, you know what?
Griffin: [laughing] No! Stop.
Clint: [laughing] Fuck this place.
Griffin: Thank you to Sam for helping us out, thanks to CAA for helping us get this show together and-
Travis: Thank you to Somerset Sews for building ⅔ of the costumes.
Justin: And the Cut/Sew for my costume.
Travis: Thank you to Lauren and Grant. The sword didn’t make it, but Lauren is posting pictures of the sword to their Twitter.
Griffin: Oh! Come to Podcon if you want tomorrow, if you don’t have tickets-
Travis: Podcon.com, you can get in-person tickets still or do remote attendance if you can’t make it down. Podcon.com.
Griffin: Yeah, they’re streaming it.
Justin: They’re literally here.
Travis: Yeah, but they’re 45 minutes away. I don’t wanna drive 45 minutes.
Justin: [crosstalk] Fair enough.
Griffin: We’re gonna be doing a The The Adventure Zone Zone where we’re gonna be talking about stuff, and a live MBMBaM and some other panels we’re all on.
Justin: And sincerely, thank you so much. You guys are so fun.
Griffin: This is always the most fun shit ever.
Justin: Y’all are grand.
Griffin: But I do have a poooooem.
Justin: Ok, read your poem.
Clint: Poooooem.
Griffin:
“And so did the wailing from down in Icekeep
give way to sweet silence, not even a peep
from the ogre, sweet Jimmy, enormous and blue,
whose visit from Santa left his spirits renewed.
And so our dear heroes, with a job so well done,
did abscond to New Phandalin for some holiday fun
and told townsfolks their story of a Candlenights saved
while back in the bathroom, dear Merle did shave.
It just wasn’t his style, a beard bushy and white.
Oh! And happy Candlenights to all
and to all a good night.”
Griffin: Thank you, everybody.
Travis: Thank you!

edit | edit source
Griffin: Hey everybody, uh real quick I wanted to set up before you listen to this episode, what it is you’re about to hear, uh, instead of putting up a new episode of Amnesty this week, we thought it would be super appropriate to put out our episode one day early today - on Wednesday - because it’s Halloween! And our most recent live show from Seattle, Washington, is a very Halloween spooktastic episode. I— It is probably my favorite live show we’ve ever done, if you are not super into our live shows, I get it, but I would encourage you to give this one a try because, uuuh, it was very very good and we were very very happy with it. Uh, very haunted, very spooky, uuuh, not suitable for people scared of spooky Halloween stuff, skeletons and mummies and stuff like that. But if you got the nerve to stick with it, I hope you enjoy this very haunted episode of The Adventure Zone Live. We will be back in, well two weeks and one day, November 15th, so, uuh, that’ll be the new episode, but for now, enjoy the spooks and scares of the Adventure Zone Live.
[THEME MUSIC: “Déjà Vu” by Mort Garson (full song on YouTube)]
[crowd cheering]
Griffin: It is... it is the afternoon of the midsummer solstice festival, the annual harvest time observation of one of Faerûn’s most spectacular phenomena, the solstice eclipse. You witnessed this once before, during a fair atop the Bureau’s headquarters when voices in the sky knocked everyone unconscious. Boy, that was weird, wasn’t it?
[audience laughs]
Griffin: I bet nothing strange like that is gonna happen this year.
[audience laughs again]
Griffin: The three of you are celebrating the midsummer solstice in the traditional manner with food and drink and dance and... frolicking and, of course, costumes. What did you attend your chosen solstice function in?
Travis: Magnus dressed up as Taako.
[audience laughs, cheers]
Clint: Merle dressed up as a footstool.
[audience laughs, cheers]
Justin: Why’s that… just, why’s that.
Clint: Just because he wanted to.
Justin: Okay.
Travis: Why does anyone do anything?
Justin: Taako dressed up as Captain Ron and then was really upset when nobody got it.
Griffin: Aww. I’m not sure I would have gotten it, Taako. Do you all think it’s definitely been, a… at least a year since the proceedings of the finale, the Story and Song. Do you all attend the... same halloween party? Or uh, do you have your own sort of circles you’re moving in now?
Travis: I mean… uh, yea—
Clint: Have we even been in touch?
Justin: Yeah, have we kept in touch?
Travis: Yeeaaah!
Justin: Roll to see if we kept in touch.
Clint: Yeah, okay.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: I got a nineteen, that’s [crosstalk] pretty in touch.
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay, so, we are very in touch. Yeah.
Travis: I think probably like Magnus organizes it, and Taako keeps saying like “if nothing better comes along.”
Justin: Yeah. And then nothing does. [Travis: Right.] And so he goes.
Clint: And Merle forgets where the location of the party is.
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: Shows up late…
Travis: He’s just there from last year still.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Okay, you all were enjoying the solstice party that Magnus put together for everyone. And you were anticipating the approaching eclipse, when suddenly you all do hear a noise. You hear the same noise together. You hear music, tiny percussive notes like melody from a music box. You each are at peace as you hear this tune, and then you are super at peace. And then your actions are no longer your own. You each leave the party all together and walk away from it. And you sort of perceive the passing of streets and people and walk together in this trance, and find yourself unable to stop this impromptu journey, and then, as quickly as it came upon you, this fugue state ends as the song fades out.
You are standing on a cliff, just outside of Neverwinter, overlooking a cape that opens up into the trackless sea, which roils several hundred feet below you. Beside you, are your two adventuring companions as you snap out of this trance and, uh, you know they were just in the same state that you were in. What do you do?
Magnus: Hey.
[audience laughs]
Travis: I was just— sorry. I fell into a trance of my own because of Griffin’s amazing narration.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Wow. That’s a very good cover for “You weren’t listening.”
Magnus: Hail and well met, other two folks!
Justin: There you go.
Magnus: So uuuuh, d’you do this?
Griffin: Who?
Travis: Other— the other— uh, you know, the other people.
Griffin: Okay, you looked at me when you said it.
Justin: And in a sense, yes.
Travis: Is it? Now when you said the other two companions, you mean like, them and me, not like, [Griffin: Right.] and there’s not two other people there suddenly.
Griffin: No, its the three of you. I don’t know why this is [crosstalk] such a stumbling block.
Travis: [crosstalk] Alright, I got it wrong! I thought you were saying, like [laughing] and there’s two other people there, too!
Clint: Merle casts, uh, does a perception check.
Griffin: Okay!
[audience cheers]
Justin: How competent.
Clint: Iiiit’s… a two.
Justin: Donesie. Yep.
[audience cheers, Justin laughs]
Clint: Merle’s eyes explode.
Griffin: Taako and the real Captain Ron are standing in front of you, Merle.
[audience and Justin laughs again]
Travis: I got a twelve.
Griffin: You got a twelve? It’s pretty weird, huh? That’s what you pick up on. That’s weird, why did we do this? Why did we walk all the way over here? That’s weird. That’s about all that you get with a twelve. But then the plot keeps moving forward [snickers] because this isn’t working.
Clint: Thank God.
Griffin: With that... great conversation, a shadow passes over all three of your faces in unison. The sun slips behind the moon, and just off the cliff’s edge, an immense spectral shape starts to take form. A new landmass stretches off the cliff you’re standing on, and atop it, a glimmering, iridescent light arcs upward from your feet, and this upward slope of light takes shape as the eclipse reaches its full occlusion. It’s stairs: a grand staircase leading up to a massive door built into the face of a castle unlike any you’ve ever, ever seen.
Travis: Magnus starts running.
Griffin: In which direction?
Travis: Towards it!
Griffin: Okay. This castle is imposing yet narrow. Its shape is punctuated with these odd spires and antechambers that hang off of its sides. The tallest point of the tower is pointing directly into the center of the eclipse, and around that pinnacle you see a cloud of bats circling the perimeter of the building. The castle’s door opens, and a blood red carpet bounds down the stairs, unraveling to your feet.
Travis: Yaaaaaaaaay!
Taako: Well... this seems normal.
Magnus: Yes. I’m— listen, I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m loving it…?
Taako: Yeah, for sure! The aesthetics are on point.
Magnus: Magic castle, [Taako: Yes,] spires, [Taako: Thank you,] a carpet? [Taako: Oooh yeaaah.]
Merle: I’m glad I perceived that.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh, do you all head into the—
Magnus: Yeaaaaahhhhh!
Taako: Heelll yes!
Merle: [donkey-like] Uh-huh.
Griffin: Okay, you all step into the castle, and the double doors slam behind you.
Taako: Ah, shit!
Merle: That’s not good.
Griffin: You are—
Magnus: [calling out] Helloooo?
Griffin: You are—
Taako: [getting softer] Hellooo?
[Tres Horny Boys all continue to say hello repeatedly, imitating echoing in a cave]
Griffin: It’s dark in here, and as you shout ‘hello’, candles hanging on the walls and columns around this room start to ignite by themselves and you see that you are standing in the foyer of this castle.
Travis: You know, it occurs to me that as you are describing this, it’s probably hard to achieve that kind of like “jump-scare, door-slams, no one was there,” when like, one-third of everyone can do magic.
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: So it’s like, the door closed on its own! [crosstalk] Like I see people do all the time.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I get it, doors close on their own all the fucking time.
Clint: And its two-thirds.
[audience laughs]
Clint: Sir. Thank you very much.
Griffin: The foyer of this castle is perplexing, just as perplexing as the building’s external architecture. It was once a beautiful, intricately designed room, but centuries of violence and decay have left it decrepit. A grand staircase climbs towards the back of the room where a large statue, a large gargoyle, with its wings curled around it and three large holes carved out of its chest watches over the rest of the foyer. [Justin inhales sharply as if to start speaking] ...Yes?
Justin: I’m going to play Dungeons and Dragons very quick. Um, I want to, uh—
Travis: Everybody stand back!
Justin: Stand back! I would like to, uh, roll a History check? [Griffin: Okay.] Looking at some of the architecture, the design, [Griffin: Sure!] see if I’m picking up on any sort of like, cultural... touchstones or anything.
Griffin: Sure! Do you want to retcon so you did this outside? Or are you [crosstalk] doing this as you are walking in?
Justin: [crosstalk] No, as I am walking in, yeah.
Griffin: What didya get?
Justin: 15.
Griffin: Hmm. Uh—
Clint: Oh, add your history modifier!
Justin: I did.
Clint: Oh.
[audience laughs]
Justin: It’s five.
Griffin: You… you don’t know the history of this place, but I do think you recognize that this place is… this place is ancient. It is maybe the oldest place you have actually been to, the oldest like structure, you know, man made structure that you have ever stepped foot inside.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: So, you’ve got the gargoyle. Uhhh, gargoyle, gargoyle, gargoyle…
Travis: You’ve got the gargoyle! Go for gargoyle!
Griffin: The candles hanging on the walls and columns of this room cast this stygian chamber in a gentle warmth—
Travis: This what?
Justin: The what?
Griffin: Stygian? Isn’t that— Did I use that word right?
Clint: You did, yes.
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: Oh fuck off! Like—
[audience laughs]
Justin: Seriously, 80% of this audience is like, “I know what that word is and can address your usage!”
Griffin: The uh, there are a few exits from this room on the ground floor level, but the most noteworthy thing is a... person [Travis: Oh!] standing in the center of the room. Yeah, I was trying to get to this NPC and you all were like, “Well, let me do my checks,” and I guess he just stood there the whole time like “Yep, go ahead.”
Clint: Yeah, well it was so stygian dark we couldn’t see him!
[Travis and audience laughs]
Griffin: This figure has his hands clasped in excitement in front of his face. He is tall and muscular and pale with dark hair that ends at a widows peak and two fangs that extend [Travis: [exasperated] Alright.] beyond his lips’ capacity to enclose them. He’s wearing a long black leather duster over a blood red vest and a black collared shirt. And seeing you enter, he says... [clears throat]
Justin: [chuckles]
Travis: Do it.
Clint: Come on. Come on.
Unnamed figure (obviously Dracula): [in a false Romanian accent with a low, nasally voice] Good evening, gentlemen!
[audience cheers, Travis laughs]
Clint: [Imitating Griffin’s accent, as the Count from Sesame Street] One! One mysterious stranger!
Dracula: Welcome to my home! I hope your journey here was not too discombobulating.
[Clint and Justin laugh]
Travis: Do you need to finish chewing? We can wait.
Taako: Hail, friend! My name is Taako, these stygians to my left are my compatriots, Merle and Magnus.
Merle: Yo!
Magnus: Hi!
Dracula: A pleasure.
Magnus: Okay.
Dracula: My name is Dra-coo-laaaaaaaaa.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Twist, right? Y’all were surprised?
Dracula: Certainly my reputation precedes me. [Travis, Justin, and Clint laugh loudly] Have tales of my sanguine customs reached Neverwinter’s shores?
Justin: [laughs so hard he begins coughing]
[audience laughs, cheers]
Travis: Alright, that’s gonna do it for us tonight, thank you so much!
Justin: In my head right now, friends, if we can take you inside the game, in my head, I am trying to figure out how Griffin is gonna prompt me to attack this figure, because currently, [audience laughs] odds are at zero percent of me raising a hand against this incredible person.
Travis: He’s going to become our fourth party member.
Justin: Yeah, right. Gonna get a new DM cause Dracula is always with us.
[everyone laughs]
Griffin: Damn. That’s season three right there.
Justin: Yeah. [in a mocking ‘pretentious artist’ voice] We’ve been looking for a new creative approach to the material, so we put Dracula in it.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Dracula has asked if you’ve heard, if you know his flavor.
Justin: [barely audible through his gasping laughter] Yeah—
Travis: Do we?
Griffin: You have to stop asking me if you know things!
Clint: Chocolate!
Magnus: Yes! I do, you are, uh, Dra-coo-laaa, as you said, um, and you are a— if I am not mistaken, a vam-peer?
Dracula: Yes, how did you knowww?
Magnus: Context clues, mostly.
Clint: [laughs] And the voice, and the voice.
Dracula: I try to keep a low profile, unlike the other Dracula, always going around, biting people in public. Getting books written about them and stuff.
Taako: Hold on, you’re a different Dracula?
Dracula: Are you saying there can’t be two vampires named Dra-coo-laaaa? This is— this is like saying there can’t be two bus drivers named Keith!
[everyone laughs]
Dracula: I am new to the area and looking for enterprising individuals with leadership experience to serve in execu— [Magnus: You got a start up?] in executive roles in the new chapter of my organization.
Merle: The JC’s.
Dracula: No! You could think of it as something of a [in a low, croaky voice] b-bloood baaaank.
Magnus: A what?
Dracula: A bloood baaank.
[everyone laughs]
Dracula: Only we will be the bank. It’s something of a peer-to-peer blood banking service.
Magnus: Wait, hold on, are you gonna eat us?
Dracula: I have no interest in eating you, I want to hire you!
Taako: Okay!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: He says,
Dracula: No, I have heard your story from the strange space fish, [audience cheers] and I assume you may be hesitant to accept this lifestyle, and so I have prepared for you something of a, a presentation on my company.
Taako: [laughing] Oh like a Pow— like a PowerPoint?
[audience laughs]
Dracula: A bit more interactive than thaaat.
Griffin: He says,
Dracula: I will be waiting for you atop of my castle. Only once you have completed the three trials located in the rooms around you... only then after you have collected the key spheres from each of these chambers, will you be able to place them into the gargoyle’s torso and come up and see me.
Magnus: Okaay!
Taako: So, can I just clarify something? So, real— real quick, [Dracula: Yes.] is this your house?
[audience laughs]
Dracula: Yes.
Taako: So you just live— is this your daily routine before you go upstairs, you complete your three challenges, put the key spheres into the gargoyle’s torso, or..? That must be really hard if you wanna run upstairs mid-movie. Gotta pause...make the popcorn...do the three challenges, get the three key spheres, put it in the gargoyle’s torso, then go upstairs.
Magnus: Additional question along with that: [Dracula: Yes.] When the eclipse ends, do you just fall through the air into the ocean?
Griffin: It’s funny you say that, actually through the like, few windows that are in this room, the eclipse hasn’t ended, it is...stuck. For whatever reason, the eclipse is not passing.
Travis: Probably Dracula did it.
Griffin: Probably Dracula did it.
[audience laughs]
Travis: That’s also my favorite running joke in Family Circus. “Dracula did it! It was Dwa-coo-la!”
Dracula: These trials will be difficult, at least, they will be for... the mortal soul.
Griffin: And he chuckles,
Dracula: [chuckling] Mhm!
Taako: I— Not an exaggeration, literally don’t know if we are [giggling] mortal or not!
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: No, you’re defo mortal.
Justin: Okay. For sure.
Travis: Well. Hmm.
Justin: Uhm, ok. Sooo, I have to ask, you, Griffin— [Dracula: Yes] No, lemmie get— Dracula, can you turn—
Griffin: I can’t turn him off at this point.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Okay. Then I’ll talk to Dracula, then. Gosh, this is just like backstage. You can’t talk to Griffin directly, you have to talk to Dracula.
[audience laughs]
Justin: I’m sorry, by the way, balcony, I keep moving the hat so you all can get the full... show.
Clint: Justin Experience.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Nah but, for real, uh
Taako: Do you, uh, do you want us to attack— there’s three, so I have to— and three of us, so I have to ask, did you intend for us to do these... together or…? One for each of us? What’s the plan?
Dracula: You can tackle them however you want. I have heard things about [slightly louder] splitting the party not being the smartest idea, but...
Taako: What are they— what are they balanced for? Are they balanced for one to three players?
Dracula: [sarcastically] This adventure is for level five hero— what are you talking about?!
[everyone laughs]
Magnus: Alright! I’m going with door number one, we’ve got twenty minutes before intermission—
Taako: Wait!
Merle: Wait, what door!
Dracula: I have to ascend before you start doing the—
Magnus: Why?
Dracula: Because I can’t be here while you are doing the challenge—
Magnus: No, you go up and we’ll start the… like, you go, and we’ll go same time!
Dracula: Okay, bye, see you sooon!
Magnus: Okay, byyeee!
Griffin: And he turns into mist and floats up through the ceiling.
Clint: [whooshing noises]
Griffin: As you look around the foyer you see three exits on this floor, two— to your right there are two doors side by side, one is labelled “Kitchen”, the other is labelled “Laboratory”. You have one door to your left which is labelled “Ballroom” and behind this door you hear some just funky music playing. Just really, just nasty bass slapping going on behind that door.
Magnus: Okay byyeee, I’m going to the ballroom!
Taako: I’m going to the kitchen!
Merle: I’m going to the lavatory!
Justin: [crosstalk] No, come on.
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, no.
Justin: No, no we— let’s not do that. I don’t wanna do that.
Griffin: Do you all wanna split up or no?
Justin: I don’t.
Clint: No!
Justin: No, I don’t. Uh—
Clint: Don’t cheat them!
Justin: Follow, follow— are you really excited about the ballroom?
Travis: Yeah!
Justin: I felt like he was leading us, which is why I was... [Travis: Yeah!] Okay, ballroom it is.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: You enter into the ballroom, it’s a cavernous space with a floor made of gleaming polished wood. To the left— as opposed to carpet? Why did I include that, it’s a ballroom. Anyway, [crosstalk] to the left side of the room—
Travis: [crosstalk] It’s a, it’s a bounce trampoline floor.
Griffin: To the left side of the room, there are a row of towering windows, but they are all covered in these dark blackout curtains that stretch floor to ceiling. There is some light in this room, however, not from the candles in the foyer. There are none of those in here, but there is a large rotating disco ball positioned above the center of this room. It’s throwing little spotlights all around, twirling in time to a song emanating from an old gramophone in the far corner of the room, one with a particularly large horn that is just blasting some old disco music.
To the right side of the door as you enter is one object that looks really out of place. It is a small pedestal made of intricately woven black metal, reaches up to about Magnus-waist height, and right atop it is a black claw gripping a small vial full of bubbling red fluid. Whaddaya do?
[pause]
Travis: I mean… probably drink it.
[audience laughs]
Taako: [crosstalk] Yeah—
Griffin: [crosstalk] I did not mean to prompt— like, “Magnus, this is your vial of red fluid,” I was just using you as a height, [crosstalk] sort of. Um.
Travis: [crosstalk] I see.
Magnus: Well, I think I know the thing: we have to dance.
Justin: I’m gonna, I’m gonna in— no, we’re— okay. I’m gonna investigate.
Travis: [crosstalk] Magnus begins dancing.
Justin: I’m, that’s fine.
Travis: That’s 7, plus 10… 17.
Justin: Wait, he has a—you have a +10 to dancing?
Travis: It’s Athletics.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Arguable.
Griffin: Is it?
Justin: Arguable.
Travis: Yeah!
Justin: Arguable. Um, Acrobatics, I would argue. But—
Griffin: I would argue Performance, more than anything.
Travis: No, I’m not performing for anyone, this dance is for me.
Justin and Griffin: Okay.
[audience cheers]
Justin: I’ve got— I’ve got a 14 investigation, I’m looking at the pillar specifically, like, what [crosstalk] anything interesting about it.
Griffin: [crosstalk] There’s no pillar.
Justin: The black, woven…
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh, yeah, okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, what a trip that would have been!
Clint: [crosstalk] The pedestal.
Justin: [crosstalk] Pedestal. Pedestal. Sorry.
Griffin: Okay, let’s resolve these in order. Magnus, you take a step forward to just get groovy on this dance floor and… you are… something runs into your head and hits you pretty hard. You take four points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: I thought you said it hit me hard.
Griffin: I mean, it wasn’t pleasant, and you are knocked backwards. [to Justin] Now with your 14, you’re looking at the pedestal?
Justin: Yeah. And the vial of blood, I mean, like, just that scene.
Griffin: Yeah, you can tell it’s not trapped, it’s not... it’s not cursed by magic in any way that you can tell, it’s just—
Justin: The vial look like anything I recognise?
Griffin: It looks like a potion.
Justin: [thoughtfully] Potion.
Travis: Um, I’m going to do a Survival check.
Griffin: [surprised] For what?
Travis: I’m going to smell it and see if I detect any, like, poison, you know, uncork it and—
Griffin: Okay!
Travis: That’s a 5 plus 11, 16. I’ve never gotten to use my survival skill before!
Griffin: Yeah, I was gonna say, I don’t even know what that one does. [audience cheers] Yeah, doesn’t, doesn’t smell poisoned.
Taako: Go ahead— well, go ahead, Merle.
[audience laughs]
Merle: I can name that tune in six notes.
Taako: No, drink the, drink the shit.
Magnus: Yeah, drink the, drink it.
Taako: Drink it.
Merle: What?
Taako: Like half, probably.
Magnus: Drink it, Merle.
Taako: Drink like half.
[audience laughs]
Taako: You’re like, small— [crosstalk] — okay.
Merle: [crosstalk] Tell you what. [sticking his tongue out] I’ll take my tongue [Magnus: Let’s all three roll.] and just put [crosstalk] No, you did your turn!
Taako: No, we’ll roll, [Magnus: Yeah—] and whoever gets highest— [laughing] sorry, whoever gets lowest has to drink it.
Magnus: Yeah.
[audience laughs]
Taako: [laughing] Bring your— you got your dice? [crosstalk]
Griffin: [chuckling] What does this look like in-game?
Travis: It’s us like, rock-paper-scissor-ing. [crosstalk]
[sounds of rolling dice]
Justin: 3.
Travis: I got 5.
Clint: I got 6!
Justin: God— son of a bitch. [crosstalk]
[audience laughs]
Justin: [upset] Goddamnit. Alright, fine.
Griffin: Alright, you drink it up?
Justin: Yeah, I lost.
Travis: “I drink it up!”
Griffin: Uh, you feel awesome. You feel super good. You actually feel, um, you’re already a pretty, like, nimble wizard, you are— you are the flip wizard. You feel actually your, like, dexterity and your agility, is, like, doubled. It is, like, out of control. You are straight-up American Ninja Warrior material right now.
Justin: Okay, well, I’m gonna— I’m just gonna roll with it, I’m gonna go on the dancefloor. I know he got bludgeoned but I don’t think I’m going to.
Griffin: Okay. Uh… heheh. [Travis starts singing “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees] Make an Acrobatics check. With an advantage. Make an Acrobatics check.
Justin: Sure. [mumbling, then amused]... that’s a miss. I’m just guessing it’s a miss.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: 10, altogether.
Griffin: No, that’s a— that would not be good.
Justin: And a… s-guh! Oh man!—
Travis: You have triple advantage.
Justin: Triple advantage?
Griffin: Nope!
Justin: No, that’s a— it’s like a 6.
Griffin: You are bludgeoned for six points of damage and knocked backwards.
Clint: Merle... cartwheels out onto the dance floor.
Griffin: You guys are so good at adventuring it blows [crosstalk] my fuckin’ mind.
Clint: [crosstalk] And does this!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Go right ahead.
[pause]
Clint: ...And rolls a seven.
Griffin: [immediately] You’re kicked in the face for 5 points of damage.
Clint: Wait a minute!
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’ll give you that! Now you can— you’ve all been hit by this thing so many times, you know that that was a foot hitting you in the fucking face. You’ve been kicked in the face.
Magnus: Alright.
Justin: Alright.
Magnus: Taako, you try it again.
[audience laughs]
Taako: Okay, well I drank— hold on, let me think. [a beat] Maybe it’s this style of music. Th— I need different music to dance to, maybe that’s—
Justin: Is there any other records?
Griffin: Why don’t you make a Perception check to see if you see any other records, if that’s what you’re...
[audience laughs]
Justin: [in accepted defeat] It’s a— I rolled a one.
[audience laughs]
Clint: Go, roll, perceive! Perceive!
Griffin: You are gonna die in this— [crosstalk]
Travis: [proudly] I rolled a nineteen.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Plus one.
Griffin: There are no other records. You do see, with that check, the curtains hanging on the windows are moving as if they’re like caught in a very faint breeze from time to time. And as they move, they let in a little of that weird gray eclipse light from inside, and when they do, you can swear that you see, like, shapes. Just for a second, and then they’re gone.
Travis: Ooh, I pull down one of the curtains.
Griffin: Okay. You pull down one of the curtains and it floods this room with this grey light, and then you can see... you see figures taking shape all around the ballroom. Hundreds of spectral forms all disco dancing, and couples all wearing adventurer’s gear, floating through the air, just sort of quickly moving around the room, all revolving around the disco ball at the center. They are just tirelessly grooving to this music, their flailing limbs forming a formidable gauntlet for any who would attempt to move further into the room.
But you also see, seated just to the side of the curtain you just pulled down, a young human woman. The ghost of a young human woman, who is also dressed in adventurer’s clothes. She’s got some light leather armor, and like a triangular leather hat, and a quiver of crossbow bolts, the whole deal. And she’s just kinda hunched over looking at the dancers, looking kinda bored.
Travis: So the people dancing on the floor are all dancing in pairs?
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: Disco dancing in pairs.
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: Merle casts Speak with the Dead.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: You could have also said “hi”.
Griffin: No, I like this.
Clint: Well, th— but if I’m just now speaking with ‘em, that’ll be one of the things I say to them.
Griffin: Okay. Uhh, Merle, this— this ghostly human woman looks up at you as you cast this spell and uh, says— can everybody hear this, or just you if your Speak to the Dead spell— does it say?
Clint: Uhm.
Griffin: You don’t have to lie.
[pause]
Clint: No, I—
Griffin: Okay, she speaks to everyone. She says...
Clint: Okay. Phew.
Griffin: She says,
Ghost Woman: [in a high-pitched, sing-song, ghostly voice] Hellooo, this is what ghooosts sound liiike.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Lotta really good character work from you today.
Clint: It really is.
Griffin: Thank you.
Merle: Um, hello. I’m Merle, and these are my sidekicks.
[audience laughs]
Magnus: Uh. Do you wanna dance?
Ghost Woman: Absolutely nooot. I’m goood. You all shouldn’t have cooooome heeeeeere probably.
Magnus: Okay.
Ghost Woman: Sorry, it’s real annooying to taaalk like thiiis.
Magnus: You could not.
Ghost Woman: Uhh, lemmie tryyy. [a beat] [strained] Heyyy— nope it’s gonna coome oout thiis waay.
Magnus: Um, do you have any insight here as far as like, what we need to, [crosstalk] you know, do?
Ghost Woman: You know, I’ve gooot insight for daaays. I, liiike everyone here, came to this castle to kill Dracula, but ooobviously beeefed iiit.
[Travis and audience laughs]
Merle: Why aren’t you dancing?
Ghost Woman: I don’t feel like iiit.
Merle: Hm.
Magnus: So what do we need to do?
Ghost Woman: Well, big piiicture, kill Draculaaa—
[Travis laughs]
Merle: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Ghost Woman: I had a few weapons Iii thought were maaybe promising, but they were taaken from me when I beeeefed iiiit. [Travis and Justin laugh] I heard Draac say he was going to buuurn one of my weaaapons, seems like I was ooon to something… but! Little pictuure, you need to get the keeey sphere, it’s inside the diiisco ballllll.
Magnus: Okay.
Travis: And I chuck Chance Lance at the disco ball.
Griffin: Uhhh, okay. Make an attack roll.
Travis: [rolls] Uh, nope.
[someone snorts like, right into the mic]
Travis: Uh, I mean it ends up being like a 12.
Justin: Dracula is ruinin’ our rolls.
Griffin: It gets hit by one of these dancing, uh spectral disco dancers, and gets just knocked across the room.
Travis: I call it back.
Griffin: Okay.
Taako: Um, so if I danced good enough, could I.. .get… to the… ball?
Ghost Woman: Yeah, probablyyy. You didn’t driiink the poootion diiid yoou?
Taako: I did [crosstalk] drink the po—
Ghost Woman: [crosstalk] Ohhh beeeeans.
Taako: Aw no, is that— was that wrong?
Ghost Woman: I don’t know.
Justin: Okay, well, now that I can see everybody, I’m gonna go back out to the dance floor and try to really [Griffin: Okay.] shake… shake… the stuff.
Griffin: Gimmie an Acrobatics roll.
Clint: I think— I think this demands some kind of audio component, Griffin. At least give us a disco song that everybody’s dancing to.
Griffin: [defeated] Sure. Uh, it’s like, this one’s like— no yeah, this one’s like [makes funky disco noises].
Clint: So like the Ohio Players, [crosstalk] we’re talking like—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yes. Sure.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Roll an Acrobatics check for me, Juice.
Justin: It’s not Performance?
Griffin: Uh, sure, Performance works too.
Justin: It’s Acrobatics.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: You have advantage.
Griffin: You have advantage.
Justin: Well, let’s see how that goes… ayy, a natural 20!
Clint: Whoo, a nat 20!
[audience cheers]
Justin: All right!
Griffin: Yeah, you groove right to the center of room, and make it past all of the dancing couples, and as you reach the center of the room, you are now standing immediately underneath the disco ball, and have access to it. Everyone else is just kind of spiraling around you, sort of— you’re in the eye of the storm.
Justin: Umm… I will— can I reach it? [crosstalk] Is it out of reach?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah!
Justin: I’ll grab it.
Griffin: [laughing] Okay! You grab it, and as you do, the mirrored pieces of the disco ball just fall away and now you are just holding this sphere. It’s a small black sphere, about the size of a grapefruit, and carved into it with red ink is this symbol in the shape of a bat. And as you hold it, all of the other ghosts in this room vanish from sight.
Travis: [to the tune of the Final Fantasy Victory Music] Babababum ba bum [crosstalk] ba ba baaa!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, I guess so, that took a long time.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah! Whoo!
Clint: [crosstalk] Yeah!
Griffin: Where are you going next? Which chamber?
Travis: The kitchen!
Justin: Kitch— yeah, kitchen.
Griffin: All right.
Travis: We’ll go to the laboratory—
Griffin: It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust as you step into the kitchen. The entire room is just brilliant, illuminated by these lamps on the walls which refract light off of gold-plated cookware and gilded cutlery. Everything—
Travis: Tell me about the backsplash.
Griffin: It’s gold, and beautiful, good bla— backsplash. Nobody in HGTV’s House Hunters would have anything shitty to say about this backsplash. Uh, everything in here is immaculate and fancy and beautiful. Taako, you know your way around a cooking room— I don’t know why I said that, um—
[Travis laughs]
Travis: You know—
Griffin: [Crosstalk] And this is—
Clint: [Crosstalk] You know, a cooking room!
Griffin: [Crosstalk] This is like—
Travis: [Crosstalk] If only we could come up for a better word for it than cooking room. Maybe someday!
Justin: Everything’s there. The cut— the cut sticks, the stir wands.
[Audience laughs]
Justin: All the great, the great different things!
Griffin: And this is—
Justin: The heated box!
Griffin: This is like, top five best kitchen you’ve ever been in.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Just off to your right as you enter, though, is one object that doesn’t match the aesthetic. It’s another one of those pedestals, holding another potion. Uh, and you also see movement out of the corner of your eye, and you see an object laying on the kitchen island. It is a golden spatula, and it starts to rattle a little bit on the table, and then it grows arms and legs, and it stands up on its handle. And it grows a little mustachioed face on it, and it says,
Spatula: [a dramatic voice] Guests, welcome to the Master’s kitchen! You must be tired after your journey here. Please, make yourselves comfortable!
Taako: Okay.
Spatula: I take it you’re in the process of considering the Master’s job offer? I believe you’ll find the benefits quite enticing.
Taako: Did you come here to kill ‘im?
Spatula: [incredulous, bordering on sarcastic] Why, no!
Magnus: Did you used to be a person?
Spatula: [sing-song] Maybe! [audience laughs] I’ll never tell!
Merle: Did you used to be a singing candelabra?
[audience laughs]
Spatula: I don’t know about candelabra, but I could sing a song.
Griffin: And he starts to break into song as other objects in the room [Travis: No wait, don’t— !] lift up and spring up— [crosstalk, Clint starts singing “Be Our Guest”]
Justin: [crosstalk] No, no, no, it’s different. [To the tune of “Be Our Guest”] Visit us! Visit us! Sit on down, and eat some food.
[audience and Clint laughs]
Justin: We think you’re really gonna like the food! [Griffin laughs]
Travis: Please leave a Yelp review!
Justin: Don’t make it one star or two, just visit us, eat some food— we made it.
Griffin: He goes— [audience laughs and cheers] he go— [crosstalk]
Merle: So what is your name, Spatula? [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Wait, he’s trying to talk!
Griffin: [crosstalk] — I’m not gonna sing your song, it’s done, uh, [Clint: Oh.] it just goes on—
Justin: Dad’ll never learn any of the names.
Griffin: Yes, it just goes on and on like this, and the whole kitchen is getting into it. There’s dishes twirling in sync, there’s champagne bottles firing off just fountains of bubbly, it’s a remarkable display, and one that you feel pretty certain is not gonna help you at all in finding the orb hidden somewhere in this room.
There are several areas you can check. There is the— there are cabinets above and below the kitchen sink, there is also a china cabinet off to the side, there’s an oven, a fridge, a freezer, uh, silverware drawers, a liquor cabinet, and a furnace.
Justin: Oh my god.
Griffin: You don’t have to memorize all those, just name one that you wanna [crosstalk] check out.
Justin: [crosstalk] I’m looking in the cabinets.
Clint: [crosstalk] Liquor ca— tshoo.
[audience laughs]
Travis: Magnus drinks the potion.
Griffin: Oh, yeah there’s also the potion. Let’s resolve that first! Go ahead. You just chug it down?
Magnus: I mean, Merle, you wanna roll again? [to Taako] You’ve already got the red potion.
Merle: ...Okay.
Magnus: This time, high— high one wins.
Merle: W-wait a minute. [laughing] High one wins by not having to drink it?
Magnus: No, no, I wanna drink it!
Merle: A’ight.
Travis: I got a four.
Clint: I got a sixteen.
Travis: Merle drinks it.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Wait a minute.
[glass clinks as Clint presumably picks up a drink as if it were the potion]
Travis: Nope, no, that’s real beer, Dad, no!
Clint: Oh!
Griffin: You would hate that! Uh, okay, you drink the potion, Mac, and—
Travis: [in the background] No, that’s my water. [crosstalk] You can’t have that either.
Clint: [crosstalk] Okay.
Griffin: [crosstalk] [laughing] Let’s play Dungeons and Dragons. Look at the clock. Do you see the scary low number on it?
Clint: [makes glugging noises as if drinking] Ahhhh.
Griffin: You down the potion in the worst foley I’ve ever heard in my fucking life. [audience laughs] And suddenly you feel your senses heightened supernaturally. You have these very powerful senses, a Sixth Sense almost, you could call it. And you can tell there is—
Merle: I see dead people.
Griffin: Okay.
Magnus: That was the other room.
Merle: Oh, sorry.
Griffin: There is nothing, you can tell, there’s nothing in the oven, there’s nothing in the overhead cabinets, or the silverware drawers. There is something powerful in the furnace in this room. That’s what you can tell with your heightened senses.
Merle: Hmm. [Griffin: So, underneath—] Taako! Go look in the… furnace?
Griffin: Sure.
Merle: Remember she said that Dracula tried to burn up her weapon. I bet there’s [Taako: Right!] a really groovy weapon in there.
Magnus: Ah, sick memory!
[scattered audience laughter]
Taako: Um.
Merle: Thank you.
Magnus: It’s not gone yet.
Justin: Uhhh.
Merle: What isn’t?
Magnus: [unamused] Okay.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Okay, I will check out the furnace.
Griffin: Okay! Uh, you throw it open and there is indeed a very powerful heat coming out of the furnace. And the— the cookware and stuff still singing the song kind of eyes you, looking kind of nervous as you start poking around the kitchen not sort of being entertained by their song. You can see, uh, something in the ashes of the fire, uh, that— not ashes, but there’s something in the fire you can tell.
Clint: Fire.
Griffin: Um, [Justin: Uh.] you see a shape, not a spherical shape, but there’s something in there.
Justin: I will, uh… pull my hair back in a ponytail, [Griffin: ‘Kay] one. Two, cast Fire Shield. [Griffin: Okay.] On myself.
Griffin: Alright, I assume that gives you a shield against fire.
[Justin clicks his tongue and Clint laughs.]
Griffin: Okay, you are shielded from fire!
Justin: Truth in advertising. And I’ll just fuckin’ root around in there.
Griffin: Okay! It doesn’t take you long, you reach in and at the bottom of the furnace you pull up what looks like, uh, a long cable that’s been fashioned into a whip. It is a long metallic whip.
Travis: [laughing] I just heard someone go “Yess”! “Yess”!
Griffin: That is what you find. [crosstalk] Magnus.
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay, I pick it up with t— my thumb and forefinger [laughing] and hand it to Magnus.
Griffin: Okay! Magnus, uh, where do you wanna check? We still have—
Clint: And it burns his pocket.
Griffin: Underneath cabinets, china cabinet, uh— uhh—
Travis: I’m gonna check that china cabinet.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I’m gonna check it real hard!
Griffin: You see as you— [Travis makes a growling noise] you open it and you see inside a small lil' teacup and a teapot next to him, and he hops over to you and he says—
Magnus: [yells in surprise]
Griffin: He says,
Teacup: [in a high pitched voice] Mama, mama, look! It’s a… it’s a human man!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: He says,
Teacup: Let’s get ‘im!
Travis: I close the cabinet!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Make a Dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Hoo boyy! Uhh, that’s a twelve.
Griffin: Uh, small teacup and the teapot next to him, you hear the teapot go,
Teapot: [in a false Romanian accent] Yes, dear, let’s get him.
Griffin: And they smash themselves against the side of the cabinet, and just razor sharp porcelain comes spraying out at you.
[audience and Justin laugh]
Griffin: You take nineteen points of, uh, damage.
[audience and Justin laugh again]
Griffin: Merle, where do you wanna look? We have the, uh, the fridge, the freezer, the underneath cabinets, uh, the... liquor cabinet. I think that’s it.
Clint: [quiet and gleeful] Let’s do the liquor cabinet.
Griffin: Okay! You pull it open, there is no trap in there waiting for you, you do see some bottles of wine, and some bottles of booze. You do see one small strange crystal vial, sort of hidden, tucked away in the back, and as you pull it out, uh, you can sense— you’re a cleric. You know what this is. This is holy water.
Clint: Ch’yeah!
Griffin: And there’s a little post-it note on it that says [in Dracula’s voice] “Do not drink this.” [audience laughs] Uh, Taako.
Justin: Uh, where do I have left? I’ll check the fridge. I’m goin’ to the fridge. [Griffin: Okay!] Yes, check the fridge.
Griffin: You open up the fridge. There are no traps in there waiting for you, there’s just some… I mean… some blood. Uh, there’s also—
Travis: Is it loose?
Griffin: There’s also— Yes, just loose blood. Uh, and in the crisper, there’s a whole bulb o’ garlic!
Justin: Nice, I’ll put that in my pocket.
Griffin: Okay! Magnus— [laughing] you all are cleaning up this fuckin’ room.
Travis: Um, I’m gonna check the— what’s left?
Griffin: Underneath cabinets, cabinets, and freezer.
Travis: I’m gonna check that freezer.
Griffin: Uh, okay. You, uh, open up the freezer and [chuckling] make a Dexterity saving throw.
[audience laughs]
Travis: Damnit. [a pause] Nope.
Griffin: And some icicles shoot out of the freezer. I guess living icicles? And they’re like singing along the song? Like…
Icicles: [to the tune of “Be Our Guest”] We’ve… we’ve got wine, we’ve got soup… have some chicken, have the coop!
Griffin: Um, and…
[audience cheers]
Clint: “Have the coop”?
Justin: It was good. That was good.
Travis: “Borrow my car!”
Griffin: You take 9 points of ice damage as these jab into you— but! As they enter your body, you see laying at the bottom of the freezer, the next key sphere.
Travis: [defeated] I pick it up.
Griffin: And... everything in this room just starts falling over. That spatula, uh—
Justin: [amused] It’s not instant, is it? It’s like, slow.
Griffin: It’s slow, it’s like— [Justin laughs] and the spatula doesn’t realize that all of his friends are— [crosstalk] falling down—
[Travis starts singing “Whatcha Say” by Jason Derulo]
Clint: [crosstalk] [getting gradually lower] “Be our gueeest...”
Griffin: He says,
Spatula: [to the tune of “Be Our Guest”] Juicy fruits, and crispy pastries— hot and fresh, and soup— [he stops abruptly and there’s a beat]
[audience and Justin laugh]
Griffin: Falls over and dies.
Justin: They all die.
Griffin: Onto the laboratory! So fast! You enter the door marked “Laboratory”— Or laboratory. I don’t know what’s wrong with me— and step into a cramped, cold, and profoundly filthy chamber. There’s a flight of stairs leading down to the ground level of the laboratory, all over there are lab notes made unreadable by the passage of time and the spillage of various fluids. There is one container in this— there’s a bunch of broken beakers all over, there’s one container left intact, it’s, uh. ‘Nother potion.
Travis: Magnus just goes in and downs that.
Griffin: Okay! Uhh, I’ll tell you what happens, in a second. The largest feature in the room is a machine that takes up nearly the entire back wall, it’s about ten feet tall with two Tesla coils that emerge from its peak. There are large pipes and, uh—
Clint: Two ‘testicles’?
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Woof. There are large pipes and bundles of cables that form a labyrinthine tangle across this machine’s surface, and it ends at a console [Travis is containing his laughter in the background] at the center of the machine with a lever. [a beat] [laughing] It wasn’t that good.
Travis: It was pretty good.
Griffin: The, uh—
Clint: They come in pairs!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Fair. The uh, this lever, either— it’s binary, it either points to the left or to the right. Right now it’s pointing to the left, and flanking this lever on both sides are two metal beds, both of which appear to be hosting a humanoid body covered in a large cloth. Waddaya do?
Travis: Drink the potion.
Griffin: Okay, you drink the potion? Uh, and... Merle and Taako, um… Magnus just seems to have more presence in the room than he did before.
Clint: He always gets the most presents.
Griffin: Um, not like that, he— he seems like… you wanna, like… you wanna talk to Magnus. You wanna see how Magnus is doin’. He just seems more— he seems more charming than he did before he drank the potion.
Travis: Impossible!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: What do you all do now?
Travis: I look— [stutters]— the bodies, are they, like, under sheets?
Griffin: Mhm.
Travis: [low] I’m lookin’ under those sheets.
Griffin: It’s a Frankenstein.
Travis: Oh, okay.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Which one’s the Frankenstein?
Griffin: Both.
Justin: Two Frankensteins?
Griffin: Can you even imagine!
[audience and Travis laugh]
Travis: You know what? Magnus sees the lever, he’s gonna pull it. [Griffin: Okay.] Switch the lever over.
Griffin: Nothing happens.
Justin: [groans in disappointment]
Travis: I’m charming, though.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: I— I— I, uh, ask Magnus, like,
Taako: So, wh-what was the idea?
Magnus: Well, there was a lever, so I pulled it.
Taako: Oh. Alright. That’s cool, I just wanna keep talking to you.
Merle: Hey, uh— [some crosstalk with Taako] [Taako: Yep.] Hey, uh, could I heal you? Would you let me heal you?
Magnus: Uhh, so…
Merle: Pleeease? Pleease? You’re so charming.
Travis: What is there other than the lever?
Griffin: Uhh, [Clint: I heal Magnus.] why don’t you make a roll— okay.
Justin: Not an action, you can’t just heal somebody, you gotta use a potion, or an item, or a spell, or…
Griffin: That’s what he’s doin’.
Clint: I did! Healing Word!
Travis: [crosstalk] What am I— am I investigating?
Clint: Wait a minute, am I not healing you?
Griffin: Yes, Merle, how much do you heal Magnus for?
Clint: You know. Um. [audience laughs] Do you have a d4?
Travis: I’m back to full!
Clint: Can I use your d4? [blows air into the mic] 1d4—
Travis: That’s four.
Clint: Four, plus my spell modifier.
Justin: He doesn’t know that.
Griffin: Uh, let’s say… yeah, that’s twelve points of damage you are healed for, Magnus.
Justin: [insincere] Good job, Dad.
Travis: Great.
Clint: You’re welcome!
Justin: [insincere] Good job. [audience cheers] I beg of you, don’t.
Clint: I finally do something cleric, and everybody [laughing] busts my ass!
Travis: I got a seventeen for Investigation.
Griffin: Uh, the machine’s unplugged.
[audience laughs]
Travis: I plug it in.
Griffin: Okay! As you plug it in, the machine comes to life. Your hair stands on end as electricity crackles between the two coils, passes through the circuitry and into the lever’s station, and into the bed on the right, where the lever is switched over to. And as it passes through, the Frankenstein under there sits up and says, uh,
Frankenstein: [in a light, relaxed voice] Oh, hey!
[audience laughs]
Magnus: Hello!
Frankenstein: Hey, I’m Frankenstein.
Magnus: Hi, friend.
Frankenstein: A lot of people will say I’m Frankenstein’s monster, [Magnus: No.] but they’re pedants and j— kinda jerks.
[audience laughs]
Magnus: I mean like, if I had a child, right? If I created life, [Frankenstein: Yeah.] it would be named after me, they wouldn’t say “That’s Magnus’s kid”.
Frankenstein: Sure, sure, sure. Hey, you all wouldn’t happen to need the key sphere to go on with this job interview—
Magnus: I would!
Taako: Indeed!
Frankenstein: Oh, that’s easy!
Griffin: And he pounds his fist against the bed he’s sitting on, and a compartment on the machine flips over, revealing a blue and a red button. And he says,
Frankenstein: All you have to do is press that red button right there.
Magnus: And what will that do?
Frankenstein: It’ll give you the key sphere!
Magnus: Well, hold on—
Clint: Merle casts Zone of Truth!
[audience cheers loudly]
Justin: Alright, I’ll give it up. I’ll give it up.
Griffin: Oh, I have to roll to save. [a pause] [quietly] I rolled a six.
Clint: [laughing] Nah, dudn’t do it.
Justin: Ya think.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah. He is bewitched.
Magnus: So what happens when I press that button?
Frankenstein: The red button?
Magnus: Yeah.
Frankenstein: It’ll give you the key sphere!
Taako: What will the blue button do?
Frankenstein: It’ll kill ya.
[audience laughs]
Taako: What would the other Frankenstein tell us?
Frankenstein: Well, my companion over there always lies— [crosstalk, Clint laughs] he’ll tell ya that the blue button—
Magnus: [crosstalk] Oh, okay.
Taako: [crosstalk] It’s kinda one of those— You know what, I’m gonna check his flavor real quick.
Frankenstein: Okay.
Justin: [laughing] I’ll flip the lever to the other side.
Frankenstein: No, that’ll kill me!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: The other Frankenstein sits up and says,
Left Frankenstein: [sounding the same as the right Frankenstein] Oh, hey! I’m Frankenstein.
Taako: Are you— Is it—
Left Frankenstein: A lot of people say I’m Frankenstein’s monster—
Magnus: [interrupting] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Taako: [laughing] Okay we get it.
Justin: Is this Frankenstein in the Zone as well?
Griffin: Uh, yeah.
Taako: [holding back laughter] These button’s over here, what would the red one do?
Left Frankenstein: Oh, the red one? It’s the key sphere one. I would’a told you it’s the blue one.
Taako: [laughs] Okay!
Justin: [laughing] I slam the—
Left Frankenstein: I’m the— No, listen! Listen, listen. [louder as Justin bursts into laughter] No, listen, listen, listen! [Travis: I flip—] Stop wait! [beat] I’m the liar Frankenstein.
[Justin bursts into laughter again, and so does the audience]
Justin: I hit the red button.
Griffin: Okay. You press the—
Travis: [laughing] I do switch it back over to the telling-the-truth Frankenstein—
Left Frankenstein: No, that’ll kill me!
[laughter]
Right Frankenstein: Hey, what’s up?
Taako: [laughing] Heeey.
Magnus: Hey, you wanna come with us? We’re putting together a team of monsters.
Right Frankenstein: No, I’m-I’m good. Uh, actually—
Magnus: If you get off the table do you die?
Right Frankenstein: I don’t know, never tried it, uhh—
[Travis laughs]
Griffin: As you reach in and touch the red button, it just turns into the orb as you pull your hand backwards and the machine shuts down, and you have all three orbs. And we’re— [audience cheers] I didn’t really— [chuckling] I forgot about Zone of Truth a little bit.
Justin: I rush in there and put ‘em right in the gargoyle’s ass.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: [chuckling] Alright.
Travis: We all take turns putting it in the gargoyle’s ass.
Griffin: Cool, cool, cool! As you place the final orb into the gargoyle’s... ass, [rushing now] the ground beneath starts to rumble, the wings spread out, it turns into an elevator, it’s super cool! We’re so behind.
Clint: Twenty minutes ago this would’ve been described [crosstalk] in intricate detail.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh, so much description. The gargoyle had a whole thing. Um, and uh, it turns into an elevator that ascends, and you are passing through the castle quickly, now, going up this elevator shaft that cuts through the whole of the building, passing by alcoves and hallways and dungeons, and just, spooky... shit. Uh, but it ends as you reach the top of the castle, and you are in a large, rectangular room, it is lined to the left and right with these large, gothic, stained-glass windows depicting Dracula in various fashionable poses. [audience laughs] Several of these windows are covered in tattered, red curtains; at the back of this room is a dais with a wide, dark, wooden throne on top of it, with another red carpet running down the stairs right to your feet; behind the throne, against the far wall, are several large painted portraits of Dracula in which he’s— he’s just working it, he’s just smizing and tooching, and the whole deal. And as you lift up through the floor, you see Dracula seated on this wooden throne, about fifty feet away, and he says,
Dracula: [from far away] Greetings!
Magnus: [yelling] What?
Dracula: [far away] Gree— Co— you have to come over here, th— [audience laughs] They made the room like, crazy big, I don’t know why.
Travis: We walk closer.
Justin: We approach Dracula.
Dracula: [close now] That is better. [audience laughs] So what did you think of my presentation?
Magnus: [stumbling] It was— I mean, it was—
Taako: [“I don’t know” sound] Impactful.
Magnus: Yeah.
Taako: For sure.
Dracula: Did you drink the potions?
Taako: All of ‘em! [Magnus: Mhm, yeah.] For sure.
Dracula: Um. So the powers they imbued you with, they are only temporary. But what if I told you they could become permanent? All you have to do is let me… sire you.
Magnus: Excuse me?
Dracula: Sire you. [slower] Sire you.
Merle: Sire us?
Magnus: You wanna make us vam-peer.
Dracula: Uh, executives, yes.
Merle: Wh-wha— which is it?
Dracula: [a pause] Yes.
[audience laughs]
Taako: You wanna turn us into businessmen vampires?
Dracula: Yeaaas.
Taako: [enthusiastically] Yeah!
[audience laughs]
Magnus: Ah, wait. Hold on, Taako. [a beat] Do you really wanna have to go to meetings?
Taako: [emphatically] No!
[audience laughs]
Dracula: There will also be slaughter.
Merle: [crosstalk] Of… us?
Magnus: [crosstalk] That’s fine.
Taako: [crosstalk] Okay, I’ll milk toast on that, [Dracula: Ok-ay!] but the meetings were— no thank you!
Dracula: The process also does hurt a lot, but only for a little bit and then only just kinda of… a bit for… the rest of your… life.
Taako: [groaning] Oh. This is sounding less appealing.
Dracula: We have to tell you this stuff up front, we’ve gotten in some legal [crosstalk] trouble.
Taako: [crosstalk] Figures.
Magnus: [crosstalk] Yeah.
[audience laughs]
Taako: What’s the cape situation?
Griffin: Huh?
Taako: What about capes? Where do they fit in?
Dracula: They’re a little plain, black leather dusters are hot now.
[Clint laughs]
Magnus: Uh, I think… we’re gonna have to pass?
Taako: Yeah.
Magnus: Yeah.
Taako: This has been great though, thank you so much.
Magnus: [insincere] Yeah, totally chill, let’s hang again.
Dracula: That is disappointing [Magnus: Yeah.] because it means we have to fight.
Magnus: [crosstalk] Oh no!
Dracula: [crosstalk] I know!
Taako: [crosstalk] What!?
Dracula: There’s one thing I have to do before the fight, hold on one second.
Griffin: He’s, like, come down to talk to you about this, and then he runs back up to his throne, and he pours himself a glass of wine, and he takes a swig and he shouts,
Dracula: [yelling] What is a man?!
[audience cheers, Justin laughs]
Dracula: [yelling] A miserable little pile of secrets. But enough, have at you!
Griffin: And he throws it to the ground. And then— then he kind of— sheepishly walks back down to the three of you and he says,
Dracula: Okay, that— sorry, I have to do that every time, but, um. Where were we? Oh, yes, we were going to fight. It doesn’t seem quite fair though, three on one.
Griffin: And he gazes at the three of you. How many uh, potions did each of you drink?
Justin: One each, I think. Right? [Travis and Clint agree] Yeah.
Griffin: Okay, go ahead and roll a Wisdom saving throw.
[audience “ooh”s]
Justin: That’s a natural 20.
[audience cheers]
Clint: Natural 15.
Travis: I’m going to use—
Clint: +3, for 18.
Travis: I’m going to use Indomitable to roll again, can I do that?
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, come on!
Justin: [crosstalk] Come on! Let it be tense!
Travis: I rolled a 5.
Griffin: Okay. Magnus, this, like— this, like, uh, anger that you feel before a fight, this, like, energy that you use to psych yourself up to defeat your opponent at hand, you feel it shift away from Dracula. You actually feel it turning towards your companions.
Travis: Specifically Merle?
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh, both of them. And you actually, you feel yourself walking over to Dracula’s side, and you feel yourself draw your weapon as you face your former friends, and Dracula says,
Dracula: Congratulations, Magnus! You’re hired!
{Intermission/Ad break 50:51-56:29}
Griffin: Hey, let’s roll initiative.
Justin: 14.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Um. 20.
Griffin: Oh, damn.
[audience cheers]
Travis: Well, he got a nat 20 plus a 2. So.
Griffin: Okay. What’d you get, Magnus?
Travis: I got a 19 plus a 2, a 21.
Griffin: Perfect!
Justin: Wow.
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: Lotta good— Burnin’ a lotta good rolls. [Griffin: Yep.] On initiative.
Griffin: Uh, alright, Merle, you are up first. You have [in Dracula voice] “Dra-coo-laa” and you also have Magnus facing you and Taako down. Whaddaya do?
Clint: Um. Boy. Okay, um, Merle casts… uh, Shield of Faith.
Griffin: Okay. On whom?
Clint: Um, [reading from the spell card] “It surrounds a creature of my choice.”
Griffin: Yeup, so. [crosstalk] Kinda the question I asked.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yep, tryina make that choice, homie.
Clint: Uh, Taako.
Griffin: Okay. Great.
Clint: Surrounds Taako and it adds +2 to AC for the duration.
Griffin: Awesome. Alright, you have +2 AC, Taako. You… are gonna need it, Magnus is up next.
[audience laughs]
Travis: Yee-up!
Griffin: Now Magnus, you feel compelled to attack your two compatriots. I’m not gonna tell you how to do it, but… don’t chicken out. But also. [laughing] Maybe don’t— [Clint: No! No-no!] Maybe don’t one-shot them with your…
Travis: I’m going to use my new found whip.
Griffin: Okay. I thought you were just gonna omni-slash Taako with the, uh, the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom, [Travis laughs] and that would be a series wrap on Justin McElroy.
Travis: Um, and you told me backstage it was the same [crosstalk] stats as Railsplitter—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, same as Railsplitter, so d10, and the— plus your regular, uh, to attack roll.
Travis: Oh. Well, that’s a critical miss.
Griffin: [disbelieving] You’re kidding me! Confirmation.
Clint: [crosstalk] One.
Justin: [crosstalk] That is a one.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Unbelievable.
Justin: He cannot hurt his friends!
Griffin: You…
Justin: His heart is true.
Griffin: Here’s what it is, you go like this to try to— but it’s like a whip and you aren’t like— you maybe haven’t used a whip, you’re maybe not proficient, this is the one thing you’re maybe not—
Clint: Oh! And it cuts your chin!
Griffin: Yeah. This is maybe the one thing— Oh god yeah, there’s that great YouTube video of the guy tryin’a do the whip that’s like 30 feet long, and it just destroys him because he doesn’t know— I think that’s what happens. And, uh, Taako, you are safe.
Clint: And you’re dead.
Griffin: Yeah. Are you gonna take any other actions, or…?
Travis: Yeah, I’m gonna do my second attack at Taako.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: [flatly] Great.
Travis: Uh, that is a 9 +9, 18 versus AC.
Griffin: What’s your AC at now?
Justin: [laughs] 15.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Plus? 2?
Justin: 15.
Griffin: H-oh shit, that’s bad. Okay.
Justin: Yeah, I’m a wizard.
Griffin: Yeah, d10 damage.
Travis: Uh, 4 plus 4— [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] — modifiers in there—
Travis: [crosstalk] — 4 plus 5 so that’s 9—
Justin: [crosstalk] — gotta get all of ‘em— yeah, every— get every juicy point.
Griffin: Nine. Nine points of damage. Now, Magnus, make a Wisdom saving throw, it’s going to be a tough one.
Travis: Uh, nope. Uh, 6—
Griffin: No, you are still enthralled. Taako, you’re up.
Travis: Plus 1.
[audience laughs]
Clint: You’re not quite as enthralled.
Griffin: Yeah, you’re still pretty enthralled.
Justin: Uhh buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-bahh… [laughs] Okay, here’s what I think Taako would probably do is he’s like,
Taako: Don’t worry, guys, I’ve got this.
Justin: And he would pull out the bulb of garlic that he has [Griffin: Okay] and just throw it at [wheezing] Dracula.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Roll—
Justin: And then he says— he says,
Taako: I banish thee!
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Taako: You have no sway here!
Griffin: Go ahead and uhh, roll a d20 for the garlic throw.
Justin: Uh, 17?
Griffin: Okay. Uh, with a 17—
Justin: Plus my garlic throwing.
Griffin: You get it in his open mouth. [Travis and audience laugh] He sees the garlic coming and is— he opens his mouth aghast [Travis gasps] like “What are you throwing?” It’s like a reflexive— something’s being thrown, he opens his mouth, it goes right in. And then he crunches down on it, and then crunches again and eats the whole bulb of garlic, and he says,
Dracula: How do these rumors about my weaknesses get spread, [Justin: [exasperated] Okay! Alright!] I mean honestly! Jus— I am weak to garlic like someone might be weak to chocolate, I cannot help myself. [a pause as the audience laughs] Weak— “weak to running water”, I have a water slide into my infinity pool in the backyard! Honestly!
Griffin: He is undamaged by the garlic, and he’s up next. Uh, he is going tooo…
Clint: I thought you threw— you threw it at Dracula?
Griffin: [laughing] Not Magnus, enjoy Magnus! He shoots a fireball at Merle, that is 20? Versus AC? Yeah. Yes.
Clint: Hmm. [Griffin: Right?] Yes. Well—
Travis: Yeah, that’s 19, which is one lower than 20.
Griffin: Oh, that’s a bad roll, uh, that is just 8 points of fire damage. And then with his second action, he is going to try to toss Taako. Taako, we’re gonna have a Strength contest, roll a d20!
Justin: You’ve come to the right place. [audience laughs] I’ll be damned. That’s a nat 20.
Griffin: Hell yeah.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Alright.
Griffin: You also would have advantage on the roll [Justin: Wow.], but with that you uh, [Justin: Not needed.] he tires to grapple you and throw you across the room, but you kinda just grab his wrist and [chuckling] set yourself back down. Uh, Merle, you are back up.
Clint: Um, Merle casts Dispel Magic on Magnus.
Griffin: [intrigued] Hm!
[audience cheers, Justin sneezes in the background]
Griffin: What’s that do?
[an audience member shouts “Bless you!”]
Justin: Thank you.
Clint: Um, [reading from spell card] “Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends.”
Griffin: [pause] Yeah, okay, Magnus, you snap out of your trance that you that you have been placed under because of your— [audience begins to cheer] potion drinking. [cheering ends] Uh, next is—
Travis: As soon as I snap out of it, I Sneak Attack Dracula.
Griffin: Okay! Sneak Attack Dracula?
Travis: Yeah, ‘cause he doesn’t know I’m out of it.
Griffin: [hesitant] Alright, I’ll give you that, what is— you’ve been rogue-trained for so long and I don’t know what the fuck Sneak Attack does.
Travis: Whoops! Flip, flip, flip, flip.
Griffin: I think it gives you advantaaage… ? [singing] Let’s look up Sneak Attack…
Travis: Yeah, uh, do-do-do [gibberish as he skims the description] “Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to any creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll…”
Griffin: Okay, I’ll give you advantage on this roll because you are getting the drop on ‘im.
Travis: “You must use a finesse or ranged weapon.” Is that the—
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: — whip?
Griffin: The whip would be that.
Travis: Um, yeah, okay.
Griffin: Okay. Roll your Attack roll.
Travis: Uh, 13 plus 9?
Griffin: That is a hit. Roll d10 plus uh— roll a d10 and a d6 together.
Travis: Not great. But— so that’s… [someone in the audience shouts something] No, I mean it was high, [crosstalk] it was a 19.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh, you have advantage, you have advantage on the roll, okay.
Travis: Ooh, actually, that is a crit, Magnus crits on 19 and 20.
Griffin: Okay.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: So roll another d10 and uh, probably just the same d6.
Travis: Uh, so then, all together, we’re looking at… [huffs] Math. [audience laughs] Okay. So plus 5.
Griffin: The answer’s not gonna be on those papers, my friend. The answer’s in your mind.
Travis: [crosstalk] 7, 9… 10…
Clint: [crosstalk] It’s in your heart.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Unlock the secrets.
Travis: 4. So 14—
Justin: Can we get a white board out here?
Griffin: 14, it actually hits him for 28 points of damage. It— [audience cheers] It cuts him across his vest and as it does it leaves like a little trail of light around where you whipped him. And he looks, uh, he is shocked, first at your betrayal, then he’s disappointed in you. [audience laughs] And then he—
Travis: This is gonna come up at the quarterly review.
Griffin: Absolutely. Uh, next up is Taako!
Justin: Uhh, I, uh, I walk up to Dracula and I say,
Taako: Hey, good news, I’ve decided to reconsider the job offer. And I still don’t wanna do it.
[audience laughs]
Justin: [laughing] And I c— I cast Sunburst.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: He again looks kind of disappointed, um, and then he waits for you to tell me what Sunburst does.
Justin: So “brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60 foot radius centered on a point I choose within range—” [a beat] His butt. [laughs] “Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12d6 radiant damage—”
Griffin: Oh my god!
Justin: “— and is blinded for a minute.”
Griffin: Okay. You all are definitely in this zone, right, in the Sunburst Zone?
Justin: I— That was— did I not say that? I should have said that at the beginning. I get 60 feet away from Drac— 30 feet away from Dracula— [audience laughs] And then I—
Griffin: With-with your agility, [smiling] you can do that.
Clint: It was implied.
Justin: Implied that I would not wanna be... [Griffin: Sure—] you know, I’ve been in the game a while…
Griffin: But Magnus and Merle are definitely gonna be up ins… the Sunburst.
Justin: It’s— Listen, you can’t make a Dracul-omelette without— [Griffin laughs] et cetera, et cetera.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: [laughing] Breaking a few hero eggs.
Justin: Without breaking a few hero eggs.
Griffin: Alright, so uh, I’m rolling a Constitution saving throw?
Justin: Indeed.
Griffin: Uh, that is a… 16?
Justin: Ties.
Griffin: Tie goes to the— you, [crosstalk] yes, hitter.
Justin: [crosstalk] Great! Okay.
Griffin: So I’m gonna need you two to also make— also I’m pretty sure yours is higher than 16 isn’t it?
Justin: It’s 16, last I checked.
Griffin: Okay, uh, go ahead and roll a Constitution saving throw, Magnus and Merle.
Travis: I got an 18, 9 plus 9.
Clint: And I got a 19.
Griffin: Damn. Okay.
[audience cheers]
Clint: Plus 3. 22.
Justin: [in the background] 7, 13… 17...
Griffin: Do you want me to… do? Oh you’re just doin’ it.
Justin: Sstt-twenty one… 26.
Clint: [crosstalk] Carry the one… 18…
Justin: [laughs sarcastically] So funny, Mac. You’re so funny, everybody loves old Mac McElroy. 29, 33, 37.
Griffin: ...37… times 2… [Travis: 74.] 74— [sarcastic] thank you, audience!
[audience laughs]
Justin: Thanks for all the great d6s you have, Travis.
Travis: You’re welcome.
Justin: You have a lot of d6s.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Uhh, okay. Dracula says,
Dracula: [sheepish] It’s a pretty good spell.
[Justin and audience laugh]
Griffin: Uh, he holds out a hand like this and a column of flame appears below each of you— rather, a circle of flame that— [whispering] shh, it’s about to turn into a column [hushed voice] if you don’t roll a good Dexterity saving throw and get off of it, Taako has advantage.
Justin: 7. [an audience member shouts something] Uh, it’s a—
Griffin: [laughing] Please stop yelling your suggestions, we got it. [crosstalk] Thank you.
Justin: [crosstalk] Please stop yelling.
Travis: [crosstalk] We got it.
Justin: Uhh. [sighs] Dang. I rolled three times now, and it’s like a 1, a 3, and a 7, [Griffin: [laughs] Okay.] I’m definitely— Doesn’t matter… [Griffin: Magnus—] I rolled too many times and it’s all bad.
Travis: Ye-up. I got a 7.
Clint: 18 +1, that’s 19.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Alright!
Justin: Woaaah! [in the background] Yeah! [He highfives Clint]
Griffin: Merle just sort of, step— step school— step stool scuttles out of the way, and Taako and Magnus are not as lucky. They are both hit in this column of flame for 19 points of fire damage.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: And then with his second action, uh, Dracula, who is getting a little bit worried, says, um,
Dracula: Hey, where did you find that whip, I thought I put it in the furnace.
Magnus: [stuttering] Yeah— the— oh, thi— what?
Dracula: The whiiip-uh.
Magnus: Yeah.
Dracula: Where did you find it, I thought I put it—
Magnus: In the fur— in the furnace.
Dracula: That’s a pretty good whiiiip.
[Justin laughs]
Magnus: Yeah.
Griffin: And then he turns into fog. And he flies backwards and disappears through one of the large portraits hanging on the room— on the far wall of the room.
Magnus: ...We won!
[audience laughs]
Taako: Congratulations, everybody!
Merle: [sighs in relief]
Justin: Well, thanks for comin’, folks, it’s been a great time, thank you, we beat Dracula together, couldn’a done it without ya’.
Travis: Magnus runs and— and attempts to run through the painting that—
[audience laughs]
Justin: Yes. Yes, he does.
Griffin: Uh, you do, the wall is not there behind the painting, [Travis: Oh, thank god.] so you just smash— [laughing] you smash right through it.
Travis: [laughing] I wasn’t sure how that was gonna go.
[scattered audience laughter]
Griffin: Uh, do Merle and Taako follow in pursuit?
Clint: ...to run into the wall?
Travis: No, there was no wall!
Justin: [crosstalk] There’s no wall.
Griffin: [crosstalk] There’s a tunnel. Behind.
Clint: [breathy] Ohh.
Justin: [crosstalk] A tunnel, it’s a secret tunnel.
Clint: Yes.
Justin: Yes, following. Yes.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: In pursuit.
Griffin: You all move through the tunnel behind the portrait, and uh, you make it to the other side and step foot into, again, this shower of grey light from the eclipse that is still hanging above. You’re in some kind of, like, observatory? You’re in this semi-circular room with a large plate-glass dome for its walls and ceiling. You are atop the castle here, overlooking the sea and cliffside hundreds of feet below. In the center of this room is a black coffin, propped up on a slanted table, flanked on both sides with urns full of wilted flowers. Right at your feet as you step inside the room are the bones of a long-dead adventurer. Their gear has long since been reduced to dust, save for one salvageable object: a long, wooden stake. Waddaya do?
[audience cheers]
Travis: I pick up the stake.
Griffin: ‘kay.
Travis: And I examine the construction to see how well it’s done— [audience laughs] Is it carved real nice?
Griffin: It could be sharper?
Travis: [confidently] I sharpen it.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Wai— hey! Time out! [clicks tongue, like the sound of carving wood]
Magnus: Weather’s nice.
[audience laughs]
Taako: Yeah.
Griffin: The stake is now sharper, I’ll find some mechanical [laughs] thing to do with that. You now have a sharper stake. [Justin laughs] Now what?
Travis: I assume, like— do we wanna do, like, the walk towards the coffin, like [deep and menacing] “Let’s finish this” kinda deal?
Justin: Yeah, I’ll sprinkle salt around the coffin. I’ve seen that in movies.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I’ll sprinkle pepper.
Griffin: Alright. [audience laughs] Just covering the bases.
Clint: I’ll sprinkle holy water on the stake.
Griffin: [intrigued] Oh, interesting.
[Travis and Justin “ooh” in sync]
Griffin: Okay. [audience cheers softly] Are you using all of it?
Clint: Nope.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: [chuckling] No, no.
Griffin: Alright, [loudly] now this is a good stake, guys. [Justin: [laughs] Yeah.] You have made this stake very good. [Justin wheezes] You have buffed the shit out of this one... wooden stake.
Travis: Uh, I throw open that coffin ready to— to just jam it.
[Justin snorts into the mic]
Griffin: Uh, the lid creaks as you pull it back, revealing: nothing, the coffin is empty, and from a distance you hear a voice shout,
Dracula: [far away] Now you’ve fucked up!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Roll a Dexterity saving throw, all three of you.
Justin: Fuckin’ walked into that one. That’s a— a 10 for me.
Travis: A 7 for me.
Justin: [laughing] Can’t catch a fuckin’ break tonight!
Travis: I know. You know what, now I’m gonna use Indomitable, though, ‘cause like—
Griffin: No!— What does Indomitable do?
Travis: It lets me re-roll my saving throws.
Justin: Not fun. [Griffin: Okay.] Just take it.
Travis: [squealing in protest] Ah— you get to cast spells!
Justin: [crosstalk] Take your coffin damage!
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, roll your Indomitable. Go ahead.
Travis: Nope. [laughs]
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Okay. Merle? What’d you get?
Clint: Don’t I have advantage on Initiative rolls?
Griffin: This is not Initiative, it’s a Dexterity saving throw. It’s a— [the audience begins to laugh] don’t laugh at him, he’s doing his best!
[Justin laughs and the audience gets louder]
Travis: Taako, did you roll your— advantage?
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah I did.
Clint: [crosstalk] How ‘bout a 6?
Griffin: [surprised] 6, Jesus Christ.
Justin: [hushed] Really beefing it...
Griffin: Another shadow appears above all of you, a figure blocks out the already-pretty-blocked-out sun, and this figure smashes through the plate-glass dome as he falls downwards, which explodes under the force of his dive. All three of you… aaaare… shredded, uhhh... [Travis: Yeup.] by shards [Travis: Oh.] … forrr… Oh, not really shredded, 17 points of slashing damage. [someone sighs deeply] And the walls of this room fall away, this dome is just gone, just sort of exposing you to the open air, and you take a look at Dracula, he is unrecognizable from what he was inside. He is just this big, muscle-y, blue monster with leathery wings and a beastly face with a mouth lined with these jagged, razor-sharp teeth. He also, I think, has like a slash across his chest from where you got him with that whip. Uh, and we’re back into the order, I forget who went laaast? I believe it was Taako because he made the sun explode and then Dracula went, Merle is up.
Clint: [sounding disappointed] Merle casts Prayer of Healing.
Griffin: Okay.
[audience begins to cheer]
Travis: Why—? Dad sounds defeated every time he has to heal somebody.
[Clint grunts]
Griffin: [crosstalk] What’s it do?
Clint: [crosstalk] It’s, uh, “Up to six creatures of my choice”, [Griffin: ‘kay.] so that would be us three.
Dracula: [begging] Oh, come on.
Clint(/Merle?): And since it’s supposed to be—
Dracula: [interrupting] No, let me get a little bit. Hey—
Clint: Wait a minute— !
Dracula: No, let me up ons!
Clint: If you heal the undead—
[Travis laughs]
Dracula: Ooh it’s worth a try, I think! [audience laughs] Ooh, maybe it’s a Final Fantasy Rules, [Travis: Yeahhh] I feel you! Hurt more— [mocking] it hurt me so bad, don’t do it, Merle! Oh, it hurt me so bad, the healing magic, I hate it! I am afraid of that.
Clint: Are we still in the Zone of Truth?
Dracula: No, we’re far away from it.
[audience laughs]
Travis: [insistent] No.
Clint: [muffled] It might—!
Travis: [laughing] It wouldn’t!
Clint: [defeated] Alright, just on us three.
Dracula: [disappointed] Aww. Where is your adventurous spirit, Merle?
Clint: 2d8 and it’s a 5... oh, do I roll it again, or I just double it?
Griffin: That’s what “two” means.
[audience laughs]
Clint: 9. Plus my spell ability modifier.
Travis: 8. +8.
Griffin: +8. Nuh— 17.
Clint: [crosstalk] 17, I heal you guys for 17.
Griffin: [crosstalk] You are healed for 17 points of damage.
Justin: Nice.
Griffin: Alright.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Magnus, you are up.
Travis: Um, well. I’m going to whip him.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And whip him good.
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: Okay, so that’s a 19, and as we’ve determined, that’s a crittt.
Griffin: That is— oh shit. [audience cheers] Damn that’s a good ability.
Travis: Yeahhh, especially when I re-member it. Um, so that’s 3, plus 5, 8… uh, 15 points of damage?
Griffin: 30 points of damage. Uh, what’s this look like? Where you— where you whippin’ ‘im?
Travis: Uh, how big is he now?
Griffin: He’s much bigger than he was inside, he’s uh, he’s like… he’s close to eight feet tall at this point.
Travis: [softly] Alriiight. I’m whippin’— I’m goin’ for the neck.
Griffin: Alright. You whip his neck, he’s like,
Dracula: [laughing] Oww, my neck. [audience laughs] You’ve whipped it…
Travis: Um— Ooh! You know what I’m gonna do, Griffin?
Griffin: What?
Travis: Gon’ take the Chance Lance…
Griffin: Ohh…
Travis: And I’m gonna tie the stake to the point with the whip…
Griffin: [as Dracula?] Interesting… [regular voice, laughing] So you’re combining three weapons—
[audience laughs]
Justin: So as part of— lemmie figure this in. As part of his turn—
Griffin: Yeah, that’s what I’m gonna say [crosstalk] is you can—
Justin: [crosstalk] So the camera turns to Magnus—
Travis: Okay—
Griffin: You can create this omni-weapon, [Travis: Right.] but it’s gonna be the rest of your turn.
Travis: Totally cool.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] And then I’m gonna Second Wind.
Griffin: You— you whip him acro— [crosstalk] you whip him across the chest, and then you say, “That was badass, hold on.”
[audience and Justin laugh]
[Clint briefly sings “Think!” by Merv Griffin from Jeopardy!]
Travis: And now I’m going to Second Wind and attack again.
Griffin: [exasperated] Oh my god.
[audience cheers]
Travis: [crosstalk] And I haven’t even—
Clint: [crosstalk] I thought you had ‘im for a second.
Travis: I haven’t even Action Surged yet. So I’m gonna throw… gon’ throw…
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: [proudly] My beautiful, beautiful spear son…
[audience laughs]
Griffin: [laughing] Okay.
Travis: [shouting] At his heart!
Magnus: [still shouting] Have at thee, you devil!
Travis: That’s a 7.
[audience and Justin laughs]
Travis: Plus 10, 17.
Griffin: That is a miss.
Travis: And then I’m going to use [crosstalk] Precision Strike.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, it goes— it goes fucking flying, way past him.
Travis: Precision Strike, hold on— ! Oh, and then add an 8 to that.
Griffin: Uh, that does hit.
Travis: 25.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: That’s Precision Strike.
Griffin: Okay.
[audience cheers]
Travis: So now do I do damage with all three, or—?
Griffin: No, I think you would only do it with the stake, which I’m gonna say, uh, is— because you like did some good shit to it, is, uh, 2d10. Uhh, radiant damage.
Travis: That’s 9 plus 5, 14, 19 points of damage.
Griffin: 38 points of damage, um—
[audience cheers]
Travis: Wow.
Griffin: Just gets ‘im— gets ‘im in the gut. It gets him right in his leathery gut, and he says— he— I don’t think he says anything, I think the sort of jovial Dracula is gone, and he’s starting to turn more monstrous, and just— fuckin’ scary… [audience laughs] at this point. Uh, and yeah. Who’s up next?
Travis: Oh, and I recall the Lance.
Griffin: Okay, it comes out of the— [laughs]
Dracula: So thank you for that, it would hurt a lot inside me.
Griffin: Uhh, Taako, you’re up next.
Justin: Umm… Okay— ehh. Yeah, I think this’ll work. Uh, I’m gonna activate— okay.
Griffin: [fearful of Justin’s famous campaign-ruining moves] Oh shit.
Justin: I have my, um— yes, this will work. I, um— I’ve got my transmuter stone, I haven’t activated it yet, which I can use once.
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: And I’m gonna use Panacea. Uh, “It removes all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that I touch with the transmuter stone.” And I’m gonna use it on Dracula.
[audience laughs/cheers]
Justin: I’m not— I’m not— I don’t know… this is your world. And I don’t know how vamp— the rules of vampires, but I feel like Taako would try this, because of the nature of vampirism, he is not… very familiar with, [Griffin: Sure.] so he would give it a shot.
Griffin: Why don’t we… roll for it. I could roll like a saving throw, I think it’s more exciting if you roll, like a— a— use your spell casting modifier, there’s like a magic effect you are trying to do on Dracula. [Justin: Okay.] ‘Cause in order— for me to just say [laughing] “you touch this dude with a stone and now he’s not Dracula anymore” [audience laughs] is a lot.
Justin: Okay, it’s a lot. I grant you. It’s a… I rolled a 12.
Griffin: Plus your magic?
Justin: Well, my— I mean, my—
Griffin: Your spell casting modifier.
Clint: Don’t you know it?
[audience laughs]
Justin: Oh, here we go. We got 17.
[pause]
Griffin: I’m gonna roll now… a Constitution— if it’s like a curse or a disease it’s decided by— that’s what he’s gonna have to save against is a 17.
Justin: Fair.
[pause]
Griffin: [meekly] That’s a 13.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: [resigned] Alright! [audience laughs] You touch him with the stone… describe this scene for me, Justin, you’re… you are… you are undoing Dracula, I just— I think this is your moment to take the camera and tell us what happens.
Justin: I mean, I have the stone, I already came up with a good idea, I don’t know why I have to write— [Clint laughs] a soliloquy about it. I run up, and I could probably reach his, like, knee-cap at this point, right?
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: And I just like, slap this rock on his knee-cap!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh, you slap the rock on his knee-cap and, uh, his wings just go flying off of his body [audience laughs] like nerf darts, they just like pop off of him. Uh, and… [breath-laughs into the mic] [audience laughs]
Travis: He turns back into Derek Reginald Acula.
Griffin: Yeah. [Justin and audience laugh] And he says,
Dracula: What are you doing with a ro— aahhh!!!
Griffin: And as his— the holes where his wings used to be just bats start flying out of him? Just like this spray of bats, and his form is shrinking back down, back to the, uh, sort of person-shape that you fought indoors. Uh, and he crumples to the ground, and then he looks up at the three of you, and he says,
Dracula: Well… [Travis snorts loudly] looks like I’ve come to the end of my rainbowww. I, uh… [Travis laughs] This is embarrassing. I had a fun time when I was being Dracula, um.
Magnus: Do you regret any of it?
Dracula: Oh yes, I mean now that you have restored my soul [laughing] the guilt I feel is immeasurable.
[audience laughs]
Magnus: You know, we work with an organization, you could come… work with us and maybe... do some good in the world.
[audience cheers]
Merle: With your corporate building expertise… ?
Magnus: [crosstalk] [enthusiastically] Yeahh.
Griffin: [crosstalk] He says,
Dracula: [despondent] I don’t— I don’t know, I don’t have any powers or anything…
Magnus: [offended] Hey…
Taako: Well, no, no hear us out, we’ve been looking for somebody to run HR… [audience laughs] the last guy was named Brad, and he was, if you’ll pardon the expression, the pits. [audience laughs] And, uh, we’d love to get’cha on the team! We could pull a few strings, no problem!
Dracula: That sounds— that sounds excellent, let’s— let’s— I’ll start filing out— filling out the paperwork [Magnus: Yeah—] and something—
Magnus: [laughing] There’s some training videos you’ll have to watch.
Dracula: The on— the only like, thing is that now I am not… Draculaaa anymore, I’ve lost my control over my castle.
Magnus: [groaning] Oooh.
Griffin: And sure enough it is starting to disappear beneath your feet.
Magnus: Aww, let’s beat cheeks!
Griffin: Uhh, okay, which—
Taako: Get on my back, Dracula!
Griffin: [laughing] Dracula grabs onto your back,
Dracula: Okay, what does this accomplish?
Taako: [laughing] We can go faster now.
Dracula: I used to be able to fly like a bat, but now I seem to not have that ability anymore, because of your weird rock.
Justin: And I say,
Taako: Leap from my back to Magnus’s back, Dracula, I didn’t think through it.
Griffin: [laughs] He leaps to Magnus’s back, the castle disappears some more.
Magnus: Now let’s run!
Griffin: Uh, okay, which way are you running?
Travis: Out!
Justin: Out!
Griffin: Back towards the elevator—
Travis: Entrance.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Yeah, back towards the entrance.
Griffin: Alright, you run back towards the entrance. Uh, make a— make an Athletics check, all of you. Dracula is not going to roll, he is on Magnus’s back.
Justin: 20! [chuckles]
Travis: I am retiring this dice. Um, mine is— [mumbling] well, let me see what my thing is, ‘cause it’s good— oh, it’s over there. [normal voice] Uh, 15.
Griffin: Okay. Merle?
Clint: [very quietly] 2.
[audience laughs]
Magnus: [yelling] Bye Merle!!
Griffin: Magnus and Taako, you all make it to the elevator, and start heading down as the observatory you were just in vanishes. And as you’re going down the elevator, you see Merle… [audience laughs] pshhew, just fall right past you. What—
Travis: I whip him.
Griffin: You whip him?
Travis: I’m gonna catch him with the whip.
Clint: Hey— you don’t need to! [pause] He has a flying broom.
Griffin: He does.
[audience cheers]
Travis: [crosstalk] Alright. Fine.
Clint: [crosstalk] He whips out the Womb Broom—
Griffin: Not the Womb Broom— [crosstalk] what did you just say?
Clint: [crosstalk] The Vroom Broom!
Travis: [enunciating] Vroom. Broom.
Justin: [crosstalk] [enunciating] Vroom. Vroom.
Clint: [crosstalk] I was speaking like Dracula! The Vroom Broom— [Griffin: ‘Kay.] And yells the phra— uh, “Hang ten”!
Griffin: Alright.
[audience cheers]
Travis: I still whip him.
Griffin: Okay. [laughs]
[audience laughs]
Clint: I deserve that.
Griffin: Uh, you all on your various forms of transportation make it outside of the castle back onto the cliff’s edge as the eclipse— as the moon finally passes beyond the sun and the sun’s rays start glistening down off the gentle waves of the Trackless Sea below. And the castle slowly fades from view. And Dracula looks kinda bummed out, he’s lived there for quite some time.
Travis: Yeah, did he grab like his box full of like important documents?
Dracula: [yelling] My important documents!!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: And you just see this box just [high pitched, gradually getting lower] peeeeeewwww [Travis laughs] splash.
Travis: [as Dracula] The pictures of my kids!
[audience “ooh”s]
Griffin: And he says, uh—
Travis: [about the audience’s reaction] Yeeah, it got real. [audience laughs] You were worried about Dracula’s kids.
Griffin: He says,
Dracula: Well, it’s, uh… do one of you have a place I can crash?
Magnus: [sucks air through his teeth and groans hesitantly]
Merle: [groans]
Taako: Yeah, we, uh. We live on the moon, you can just come… stay with us! There’s plenty of room!
Dracula: Sounds good, can I invite my friend the Wolf-Man? Oh, it’s joke! It’s a joke, [laughing] I don’t know the Wolf-Man!
Magnus: [laughing] Oh no, what happened to the truth-telling Frankenstein!
Dracula: Oh no—!
Griffin: You see them both—
Frankensteins: Woaaah!!
[audience laughs]
Justin: One of them says, “We’re fucked!”, the other one says, “No we’re not!”
[Clint, Travis and Justin laugh]
Griffin: The four of you take a look at one another, exhausted. You have saved the world once again, in the span of just a couple of hours it’s starting to get kind of old hat, the treasures and the monsters and the injuries— especially the injuries— uh, in fact— Magnus, you, uh, you notice a wound on, like, Taako, just from like the damage from the battle that’s still fresh and, like, bleeding, and there’s something about it that just looks… so deliciousss…
[audience clamors]
Griffin: [in a spooky voice] Happy Halloween!!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: That’s the episode, thank you all so much for coming! This was so much fun, thank you all!

Return to Transcript List
Griffin: It is Candlenights Eve, the night before the world’s most inscrutable and modular wintertime holiday. As everyone knows, Candlenights can shift and transform, expand and shrink of its own volition, making pinning down its beginning and end a tricky process. By your best guess, it is Candlenights Eve. The four of you are attending a Candlenights party aboard the floating headquarters of the Bureau of Balance.
The entire surface of the HQ has been transformed into a festive, wintery scene, with floating enchanted candles hanging above a yard of long, food-filled tables and great vats of warm, potent ciders. That’s the most D&D-ass shit ever.
Griffin: As you look around the yard, you see familiar faces here and there. Carey and Killian are entertaining some of the party’s younger guests with their flips and stunts. Lucretia sits at the head of one of the tables, regaling her guests with stories from your adventures thus far.
Griffin: Your eyes meet those of Angus McDonald, He sees you and waves enthusiastically. And, just then Johann steps into your line of sight, inches in front of the four of you, gesticulating enthusiastically. He says,
Clint: I am! I’m being very… my—
Travis: Or maybe keep it together!
Clint: My spondooli is protecting me.
Dracula: Aren’t your legs cold wearing that up here? It’s a bit - it’s a bit chilly, and I must say— I know I’m reformed, but those calves look delicious.
Clint: It’s actually very liberating! It is very freeing.
Griffin: [imitating Dracula at first] Do not commit crime [drops accent] on this stage, Clint. This is actually Griffin saying it. Keep it under the table.
Justin: That makes sense, ‘cause that was Dad answering, so…
Griffin: Yes, good.
Dracula: While I have you, I can now reveal: I got the three of you for the Bureau Secret Santa Gift Exchange.
Griffin: And he—
Travis: Wait, you got three for one?
Justin: [laughing] Is that how Secret Santas work?
Griffin: You’re sort of a package deal at this point. He reaches into the pocket of his duster and pulls out three small packages. As you unwrap them you find three small, white square devices. Dracula looks at you and nods.
Dracula: It is the iPod Shuffle.
[Audience and Justin laugh]
Taako: [laughing] Oh, this is great!
Magnus: Is this the one with the U2 on it?
Taako: [crosstalk] Fantastic.
Dracula: I deleted that immediately.
Magnus: Thank you! You did great!
[Crosstalk]
Merle: I can lose my Zune now!
Taako: Looks like you’ve— you’ve preloaded it with the complete works of Franz Ferdinand! Fantastic!
Dracula: Some of my favorite jams are on there. I believe you could call them… the music of the night. [Audience laughs] Warm tidings to you and yours!
Griffin: And he, like, scrunches his face up and pulls his arms in tight, and he stands there for a few seconds, and then sort of stands up and says,
Dracula: Sorry, I was trying to transform into a cloud of bats. I, uh, I used… used to be able to do that. Uh, still learning how to make a polite exit. Excuse me.
Griffin: [crosstalk] And walks—
Clint: [crosstalk] That’s the hardest thing of all to do.
Griffin: —and he walks away. And soon after, Lucretia waves the three of you over to her table [audience whoops], and Lucretia says,
Lucretia: Are you all having a good time?
Taako: Yeah, I actually got you a gift, Lucretia.
Lucretia: Oh. That’s, uh…
Taako: I know, I know, it’s the thought that counts. It’s an iPod Shuffle!
[Audience laughs]
Lucretia: Uh, I don’t know what this strange technology is, but, uh, I assume—
Taako: But I do? What is this world?
[Audience and Clint laugh]
Magnus: I got you a gift too, Lucretia. I sold my wood-carving tools to get you this staff polish.
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Lucretia: This will come in handy, thank you.
Travis: Ohhh no!
Merle: I sold my axe to buy you a hunk of wood!
Travis: It’s a three way?
Griffin: It’s a three way! It’s a rock-paper-scissors Gift of the Magi! This is unprecedented. She smiles and says,
Lucretia: Well, uh, th-thank you, I appreciate it.
Griffin: She looks kind of confused. And then she looks kind of wistful. She looks over at Angus and says,
Lucretia: Wow, look at Angus. He’s really growing up before our eyes, isn’t he?
Taako: Yeah.
Magnus: Yeah.
Merle: Yeah.
Magnus: I hate it!
[Audience laughs]
Lucretia: You know, he’s still a kid at heart, though. He keeps— he keeps talking about how he’s so excited about this… Jeff Angel toy? The, um, the wrestler? I think the— what…
Magnus: We’re familiar.
Lucretia: He was talking about the toy all night, the Turbo Jeff action doll.
Griffin: And you see Angus talking to some people at his table, flapping his arms up and down as if to imitate the action of the Turbo Jeff action doll, and Lucretia turns back to you and says,
Lucretia: So, um… where— where is it? You all got him for Secret Santa, and he made his only Candlenights wish explicitly clear multiple times— you did get the Turbo Jeff action doll, right?
[audience clamors, “No!”]
Magnus: Y— yes!
Taako: This is, uh— yeah! We…
Merle: Wrap— wrapping it.
Magnus: We’re wrapping it.
Taako: We wrapped it! We’re wrapping it.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: She just got a 24 Insight check.
Lucretia: No, you did not. No, you did not. Boys, this is bad, even— even for you. Angus was really looking forward to that Turbo Jeff.
Magnus: Well, you know, [chuckling] learning about disappointment is part of growing up.
[Audience laughs]
Taako: So true, so true.
Griffin: She says,
Lucretia: Listen, I can keep the party going for a couple more hours and buy you some time. Just run down planetside, hit up the Fantasy Costco , grab a Turbo Jeff, [audience cheers] and get back up here— and get back up here pronto.
Taako: [crosstalk] Fuck, fine!
Magnus: [crosstalk] Can we have some money?
Taako: Do you have money?
Lucretia: I— that’s a great—
Magnus: Do we have money?
Lucretia: [crosstalk] Probably—
Magnus: We’re pretty famous, and I have a school for dogs or whatever.
Lucretia: Probably a great sum of money at this point.
Magnus: Okay, I’ve been selling a lot of Sit Boys, so I think we’re doing pretty good.
Griffin: All right. One nostalgic canon blast later, the three of you drift slowly to a halt into the riverside district of Neverwinter. It’s fairly late, and most of the citizens of the city are back at home, enjoying the holiday with loved ones by the hearth. The only activity you see, which you observed as you came in for a landing, is the throng of people surrounding the entrance to the Fantasy Costco.
Justin: Ughhh.
Griffin: Hundreds of humans, elves, orcs, dwarfs, and countless other beings are mobbing the closed front doors of the store. From the distance, you see a harried Garfield the Deals Warlock floating just above the entrance—
[Audience cheers]
Magnus: We’re gonna have to fight our way through.
Griffin: —shouting something you’re too far away to hear. As you approach the crowd, you hear some conversations in your immediate vicinity.
Unnamed Shopper #1: [nasally] So they, uh, said they had Turbo Jeffs here, right?
Unnamed Shopper #2: [low] Man, I hope they’ve got Turbo Jeffs.
Unnamed Shopper #3: [breathy] I’ve looked everywhere, this is the only place with Turbo Jeffs!
Griffin: And then you hear a familiar voice getting closer to you, saying,
Klarg: Where are the Turbo Jeffs?
Griffin: And sticking a good two feet out of the crowd, Klarg the bugbear is approaching—
[Justin laughs; Audience cheers]
Travis: Now, Klarg, are you into Turbo Jeff?
Griffin: Klarg sees you and he goes,
Klarg: Boys!
Griffin: And he scoops you all up in a big bear hug.
Travis: Hugbear.
Griffin: Take five points of crushing damage.
Justin: Oh no!
Travis: Hold on, we should do a Constitution check or something.
Griffin: Nah, I caught you unawares with that one.
Travis: Aw, but I’m a big beefy boy!
Griffin: He says,
Klarg: Dang, sorry. Yeah, I’m here looking for a Turbo Jeff, goofed up pretty bad. I forgot I promised one to my daughter, Blarg.
Taako: [crosstalk] Your daughter’s named Blarg?
Magnus: [crosstalk] Do you mean B’Gnash?
Klarg: I have seven kids: Blarg, Marg, Targ, Sharg, Parg, Quarg, and Klarg Jr.
[Audience cheers]
Merle: You had those written down!
Klarg: [laughing] I did.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: He puts a tiny scroll back in his pocket.
Klarg: Listen, I thought it was funny at the time. It was, um— not the smartest naming convention. They said they were gonna team up and kill me if I didn’t get one, so [Justin laughs] here I am.
Griffin: And then you hear another voice you recognize, who says,
Cassidy: Boys!
Griffin: And then you see bounding towards you the former explosives expert and current mayor of Refuge, Cassidy, [audience cheers] who says,
Cassidy: Well, what in tarnation are y’all doing here? Don’t tell me you’re trying to get your haaands on a Turbo Jeff!
Magnus: Wait, are you trying to get a Turbo Jeff?
Cassidy: Suuuure tootin’!
Magnus: So then why would you judge us for trying to get a Turbo Jeff?
Cassidy: It wasn’t judgment, partner. I was excited to see kinship in your goals with mine.
Magnus: But then what— okay.
[Audience laughs]
Clint: You really quit on that fast.
Travis: I mean, we only have so much time in the live show for banter.
Griffin: She says,
Cassidy: Seems like you’re gonna have a lot of competition, though I got a little advantage in case it gets hairy in there.
Griffin: And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out, like, five small sticks of dynamite. And she winks.
Taako: Don’t— listen. Don’t do that. It seems like a great idea, Cassidy, but that’s not how these things are done.
Cassidy: Of course…… not!
Taako: Okay, I can see the winking. There’s no winking. No Cassidy, please don’t.
Griffin: And then you hear another voice say, right in front of you,
???: [nervously, in a voice that kinda sounds like Kermit the Frog] Uh, well, uh, heh. It seems like we’re all in the same boat.
Griffin: And the figure talking to you is a human man in his late 40’s, you would assume. He’s balding, with a small mustache that curls over the corners of his mouth. He’s wearing an argyle sweater over a turtleneck. He’s got some functional slacks on, and he extends a hand and says,
???: Uh, sorry for eavesdropping. Gerald Loggins is my name. I’m trying to snag a Turbo Jeff for my stepson, Timothy, uh—
Magnus: Hey, fuck off. [Audience laughs] We were talking!
Clint: Did you notice how quiet it got here? [Griffin: Yeah—] That’s ‘cause everybody’s going, “Which arc is this guy from?”
Magnus: Nobody knows who the fuck you are, buddy!
Gerald: Uh, yeah, of course, I’ll let you get back into it. Gerald Loggins—
Magnus: Yeah, fuck right off!
Gerald: Okay.
Magnus: I haven’t seen Klarg in, like, eight years!
Gerald: Yep. Well, lovely Candlenights to— to you and yours—
Magnus: Okay. Kiss my butt.
Gerald: All right, maybe—
Merle: And happy holidays to all of you.
Gerald: Yeah, maybe if we see each other in there we could watch each other’s— watch each other’s backs, huh? All right, have a good night. Gerald Loggins.
Griffin: And he—
[audience and Clint laughing]
Justin: [laughing] This is really good— this is some really good character development. I like how he said his name so many times.
Griffin: It’s— listen, that’s the How to Make Friends and Influence People, he’s just—
Travis: [crosstalk] Say your own name—
Justin: [crosstalk] Say your own name repeatedly!
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m Travis, everyone, Travis—
Griffin: Wait, that’s the opposite, isn’t it? Okay. You see some sparkling lights surround Garfield and notice his gestures as he casts a spell. Suddenly a large projection of a mouth appears in the sky and from it, you hear Garfield’s amplified voice. He says,
Garfield: Folks, listen! It is true, we indeed have a small selection of toys from the Turbo Jeff collection. Now, because you are a large crowd, the most sensible thing to do would be to hand out raffle tickets, allowing the winners first pick of our stock. But— [audience laughs] As I am always in need of blood, bone, and tissue for my dark machinations— [audience laughs] Let’s just toss the doors open, Battle Royale style! May the odds be ever in your favor!
[Audience cheers]
Travis: Magnus—
Griffin: And all the doors open to the store.
Travis: Magnus rushes in.
Griffin: There— you are towards the back of the crowd.
Travis: No. Shield in front of me, fucking—
Griffin: Barrelling through?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Make an Athletics check that you’re gonna fucking destroy because you have a billion Athletics points.
Travis: Yeah, it’s a 20.
Griffin: A nat 20?
Travis: I— no, I rolled a ten, plus ten.
[Audience laughs]
Clint: That’s how math works!
Griffin: Okay, Taako and Merle, you see Magnus push towards the crowd. He makes a good like, half-way through the crowd towards the door, he’s making good progress.
Justin: I’m going to cast Hallucinatory Terrain—
Griffin: What the fuck?
Justin: I’m gonna— On the store, to make it look like it’s on fire.
[audience laughing and cheering]
Griffin: I’m going to— I love this, I’m going to roll a Wisdom saving throw for everyone. [audience laughs] …All right. I got a 13. This is what’s great about that roll, and what’s so great about sort of the random narrative additions that D&D gives us. About 60% of the crowd just says, “Nope.” And peels off. The rest of them are like, “It’s on fire, but I really gotta get me a Turbo Jeff.” And plow on through, undeterred. Klarg and Cassidy are just gone, as well. You see Gerald Loggins still kind of waiting patiently at the rear of the queue, just sort of stepping behind everybody in turn.
Clint: Merle casts Blade Barrier around Magnus.
[Audience laughs; “what?”]
Justin: What!? We can’t murder people!
Griffin: What’s it say?
Clint: Hey, it’s their choice, if they don’t—
Griffin: If they run into the barrier, it’s their choice, Dad’s 100% right!
Clint: Yeah! It’s a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades! [Audience cheers] [laughing] Made of magical energy! And so—
Travis: Before he cas— Magnus does do a big, like, Andre the Giant, “Everybody move!” kind of— yeah.
Clint: Oh, do I have to roll one of those things?
Griffin: I don’t think so, right?
Travis: Does it say, like, “and you do it great!”
Griffin: Uh, okay. I think with that, Magnus, you are able to breach through most of the crowd, there’s definitely a few dozen folks who got in ahead of you, but you managed to make it into the store.
Clint: Can at least one person run into the magical barrier of blades? Just one, at least?
Justin: I feel like— okay, can I say something, I feel like our— the thrill that we’ll have if we do eventually get this Turbo Jeff doll will be somewhat invalidated by the friends we’ve killed along the way. Like, I don’t think we need a loss of life, and you’re a cleric, also. No big whoop, but you’re also a cleric.
Clint: I’ll just heal ‘em.
Travis: Would you?
Justin: Sorry, Griffin, go ahead?
Clint: [chuckling] If I have the spell slots for it.
Griffin: Magnus, you find yourself in an aisle titled “The Fresh Produce Section.” Suddenly a watermelon falls from above and explodes at your feet. As you look up, you see a large aarakocra, which is the bird person race from D&D that we didn’t really explore much of except for Jeff Angel, who is one. It’s flying above you. It’s not Jeff Angel. He’s ripping things off the shelves and launching them at you. What do you do?
[A pause, audience laughs]
Travis: I’m being attacked?
Griffin: Uh, with fruit. I’m not going to make us roll initiative. You’re in a sticky situation.
Clint: And he’s also protected by a blade barrier!
Griffin: I mean, some of the fruit is getting caught up in the blades, but it’s more of a vertical— from-up-top assault.
Clint: Oh, how convenient.
Travis: I— everything I’ve got would kill them. You know what? Can I climb the shelf?
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: I climb the shelf.
[someone in the audience yells “Yeeahh!”]
Griffin: All right. Now what?
Travis: Thank you. [crosstalk] Thank you for appreciating—
Justin: [crosstalk] Some dude up there loves shelf climbing.
Travis: I climb up the shelf and I jump from top of shelf to top of shelf to get to the Jeff Angel section.
Griffin: Duhh— that’s not where the Jeff Angel toys are, but you can definitely reach the aarakocra. Listen, I’ve got this whole thing mapped out in my mind, don’t you worry about it.
Travis: Okay, then I tackle it.
Griffin: All right.
Travis: As much as you can tackle something that’s in the air.
Griffin: Make an Athletics check for this whole maneuver.
Travis: That’s a ten, plus ten, that’s a 20.
Griffin: Jesus Christ.
Justin: Why does he get plus ten to everything? It doesn’t seem fair.
Griffin: Yeah, uh, he’s— well, he can’t—
Travis: I can’t do magic!
Griffin: Well— and he also can’t think. Is—
[Audience laughs and groans sympathetically]
Travis: No, that’s fair. Real dumb-o.
Griffin: He just tackled a bird, so. [Travis laughs] You grab— you jump for this thing, it tries to dodge out of the way but you just grab its feet and just, like, slam dunk it into the ground, narrowly missing the blade storm. And you make it further into the store. Taako, are you pushing into the store, or is Taako’s contribution to this scene pretty much done?
Justin: [confidently] I’ve done my part.
Griffin: Okay, Merle, are you pushing into the store, or are you leaving it up to ol’ Magnus?
Clint: I don’t see what good Merle would do, [crosstalk] he just can’t—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Fantastic. Lot of people, all sitting out of the game.
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s a fine sentence.
Griffin: All right Magnus, we can keep playing with you.
Clint: How— did he— wait a minute. So he took out the bird.
Griffin: Yep. There’s more, we can keep going, it’s fine. Magnus, you make it to the far corner of the Fantasy Costco, find yourself in an aisle called “Nothin’ but Fruit Leather, Jerky, and Nuts.” [Audience laughs] The aisle is empty, save for Gerald Loggins, who’s looking at a box of pistachio snack packs. He waves at you as you step into the aisle and says,
Gerald: I never realised that nuts had so many calories.
Griffin: And he turns back to the pistachios, reading the ingredients. It’s mostly pistachios. What do you do?
[Audience laughs]
Travis: I step carefully around him.
Griffin: You ste— [laughs] he appreciates that. And you go further into the store.
[Audience and Clint laughs]
Justin: Taako has now entered the store to see if there’s any light looting opportunities.
Griffin: Uh, let’s see. There is an aisle— I’m looking through the aisles I have written down. There’s one called “An Ocean of Diapers,” there’s one just called “Bones.”
[Justin chuckles]
Clint: Are there any adult diapers?
Griffin: [laughs] You could make these work for you, um…
Clint: Mmkay. I mean, I’m just asking for a friend.
Griffin: You get some diapers. Taako, you get some booones. Do you want— do you want to try to get the Turbo Jeff now too, or is it still on Magnus’s shoulders?
Justin: No, no, no, he’s distracting Big Bird, I’m going to go get the Turbo Jeff.
Griffin: All right. Taako, you are sprinting through the Ocean of Diapers aisle when you see Klarg—
Justin: I didn’t say sprinting.
Griffin: You are traipsing down the Ocean of Diapers aisle. You see Klarg in an adjacent aisle through the products on the shelves separating you. He notices you, too, and begins to shoulder charge through the shelves into you to knock them over. What do you do?
Justin: I cast Charm Person on Klarg.
[audience cheers]
Clint: Do you really think that would ever work?
Griffin: That is an 18?
Justin: No, Dad, it wouldn’t. Apparently. Apparently, no. Apparently it wouldn’t work.
Travis: What’s your spellcasting thing?
Justin: 16.
Griffin: Oh! Wou— no, it’s higher than that! There’s no way it’s 16.
Justin: All right, Dad. [Griffin laughs] Jesus.
Griffin: All right, he tackles the, uh, thing, and it falls over on you. It’s not a bad crushing, but take 14 points of damage. And almost as soon as it happens, Klarg like stops, and says,
Klarg: [flustered] Well, well, okay.
Griffin: And he starts to pick the aisle back— the shelves back up off you.
Taako: Okay, Klarg, bad—
Klarg: Yeah, I got a little in my—
Taako: Okay, bad news—
Klarg: Yeah.
Taako: That was extremely rude.
Klarg: Yeah.
Taako: Good news, I now have 69 hit points.
[audience cheers]
Clint: Good night, everybody!
Taako: You take the good, you take the bad.
Clint: It’s the facts of life.
Griffin: Merle, you doing anything?
Clint: Yeah, I’m going to cast Heal on Taako.
Griffin: Okay. You stop off in the—
Clint: But wait a minute, no! Then he’s not 69 anymore.
Justin: I will cast perma-death spells on you all day long if you heal me above 69 hit points.
Clint: Fair enough.
Griffin: Do you want to aid in the Turbo Jeff acquisition?
Clint: Yes.
Griffin: Okay. Then you find yourself in an aisle labelled “Literally Air,” and find empty shelves with price tags denoting the cost of the air circulating around them. As you stop to observe this incredibly crass business practice, Cassidy breaks off in a sprint past you. She looks at you over her shoulder and throws two of her small sticks of dynamite in your direction. What do you do?
Clint: Merle casts Control Weather.
Griffin: Love that fucking spell.
Justin: Mmm, I don’t— in the store?
Griffin: No, we can’t fight Control Weather anymore, it ends up being a 20 minute whole thing. You’re controlling the weather.
Clint: And it blows the sticks of dynamite out. It blows out the fuses.
Justin: That’s okay.
Griffin: Uh, roll a d20.
Travis: [directing Clint] Big one. Big one.
Justin: Don’t do this.
Travis: I made him buy extra large dice so he could read ‘em.
Griffin: It’s true.
[audience cheering]
Travis: Today at [simultaneously] Toy Joy!
Clint: [simultaneously] Toy Joy!
[audience cheering]
Clint: That’s an 11, plus—
Griffin: Nothing. Okay, with an 11… let’s use—
Clint: [crosstalk] Wait a minute, why’s it plus nothing?
Griffin: It’s just cause I made this roll up in my head, cause we’re playing Calvinball now. With an 11, we’re going to do Monster of the Week rules, it’s a mixed success. You manage to hit the sticks of dynamite with the wind. They go flying back in Cassidy’s face, and explode at her feet. She’s fine, this happens all the time in her profession. She goes flying through the air and lands on the ground and says,
Cassidy: Yeah, you got me good with that one! Hoisted on my own petard, and that’s the literal definition! That’s how this phrase is supposed to be used, that’s what Shakespeare intended!
Griffin: And then she passes out. She’s fine, but you blew her up… a bit. Magnus, you arrive— actually, the three of you reconvene at the toy department, where a large undisturbed display of Turbo Jeff series toys stand in a tall pyramid. Garfield materializes over this display with wide open arms. He says,
Garfield: I knew it would be you! Only Tres Horny Boys possess the cutthroat instincts required to win the day when the chips are down. How many of your competitors did you vanquish during your hunt?
Magnus: Like, kill em?
Garfield: Yes!
Magnus: I don’t think any?
Taako: How ‘bout that!
Garfield: Well, shoot! Well, the treasure’s yours, enjoy.
Griffin: And he gestures towards the pyramid. You do not see the familiar bird-man form of the wrestler Jeff Angel. Rather, contained within every box in the pyramid is an action figure of a thick human man wearing a brown suit jacket up top and a diaper down below, holding a briefcase in one hand and extending an intense pointed finger with the other. You—
Travis: The business baby?
Griffin: You realise with horror that these toys are from the Turbo Jeff toy line, but sadly are toy versions of Jeff Angel’s widely reviled manager, Cherub Joe.
[Clint and Justin laughing]
Magnus: Garfield!
Griffin: Garfield, sensing your threatening tone, pipes up. He says,
Garfield: Okay, listen, listen, I know. I know. Listen, look at me. I know. [audience laughs] Listen. You all didn’t hear it from me, but I do know where you can find a real Turbo Jeff action doll. There’s this dungeon nearby— [audience laughs] No, audience, listen! Subterranean keep, lair of a massive, ruthless ogre, at the heart of that keep, you’ll find what you desire. Fortunately, I have a map that can show you the way, and because we’re old friends… it’ll just be 300 gold pieces—
Magnus: Give it to us or we’re gonna burn down your store.
Garfield: Looks like you already are!
Griffin: And he hands it over.
Taako: [laughing] Also, can I have the diaper guy? I’m crazy about this. [audience laughs] This is hilarious! I love this!
Griffin: He hands you a doll of Cherub Joe.
Taako: Did you guys see this?
Merle: Make it do the th— make it do the thing!
Taako: It’s— he— [makes a growling sound, imitating the action figure] Rrrrrr!
Merle: [also imitating] Eeeeeehhhh!
Taako: It’s good, right?
Griffin: You pop—
Merle: [continues obnoxious beeping sound] Eeeeeehhhh!
Taako: Its little wings pop out, hysterical!
Merle: [simultaneously laughing and marveling] Ohh ho ho hooo!
Griffin: You pop the Cherub Joe out of its mint condition packaging and put it in your pocket. The three of you follow Garfield’s map into the sewers below Neverwinter, then into an underground water channel leading to a series of subterranean caves. You follow these caverns for what feels like ages, giving you plenty of time to reconsider—
Travis: We see Tom Hanks as we walk by him!
Justin: Sorry, what?
Travis: It’s from Mazes and Monsters?
Justin: Are you shitting me with this?
Clint: Wow.
Griffin: It’s, like, five people saw that film, bud.
Clint: And none of them are here!
Griffin: It gives you plenty of time to wonder whether or not this quest is actually worth it. Just as your resolve begins to waver, you find yourself at the entrance to an underground residence. The cavern you were following is blocked off entirely by a large, wooden wall. A set of steps leads up to a door, flanked by torches leading further into the residence. In the distance, you hear the footfalls of a massive creature. You also hear footfalls behind you, belonging to much smaller beings. As you turn to face them, you see Klarg the bugbear and Gerald, both looking at their own maps and exploring the caverns. And Klarg sighs as he sees you, and sort of balls up his map and throws it away, and Gerald actually looks excited as he recognises the three of you, he says—
Justin: God dammit.
Gerald: Oh, uh, hey there, guys! Fancy meetin’, heh, uhh… [audience laughs] Of all the gin joints, right? How the heck are ya'?
Justin: God almighty, this guy.
Travis: God dammit!
Griffin: And Klarg says,
Klarg: Listen, maybe we should tackle this together, we could figure out who gets the toy after. We’ll flip a coin… or something. I mean, we definitely aren’t giving it to Gerald.
Magnus: Yes.
Klarg: But we can flip a coin.
Taako: Gerald, you’re cool with that?
Gerald: Absolutely, it sounds totally fair to me.
[Audience laughs]
Taako: Gerald, what are you bringing to the party? Precisely?
Magnus: Are you like a necromancer, or… ?
Taako: How many, uh, how many all dimensions have you saved? How many times have you saved all dimensions?
Clint: [stage whisper] Use Planarverse, that drives Griffin crazy.
Taako: Planarverse!
Merle: The Planarverse!
Gerald: I, uhh… I'm trying to save my stepson’s, Timothy’s, Candlenights.
Taako: Christ.
Magnus: How many, uh… planes of existence has he saved?
Gerald: I’m just, uh— none. It would just build a lot of bridges between me and my Timothy, so, I’m just trying to… [Audience ‘aww’s]
Magnus: Have you tried just talking to him? [Gerald chuckles]
Merle: Have you tried being there when he needed ya?
Gerald: Yeah, um. Yeah, it hasn’t worked… so far.
Magnus: Are you sure you wanna build a relationship with him? He sounds like he sucks.
[Clint and Travis laugh very hard away from their mics, and the audience soon joins in. Travis yells, 'Yeah!']
Merle: How are you and his mom getting along?
Griffin: [Moving them back on track] It’s quiet for a minute. What do you do, you're standing in front of an entrance to a subterranean home. What do you do?
Magnus: Should… should we knock?
Griffin: If that’s what your character has decided to do in the game Dungeons & Dragons.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: Magnus knocks.
Griffin: You walk up the sta—
Justin: I would feel better if you patched things up with Gerald first.
Magnus: Hey Gerald— [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Yeah, it’s like hanging over everybody.
Justin: [crosstalk] It feels weird.
Magnus: [crosstalk] There was a bug(?) in the air—
Justin: [crosstalk] It was so unnecess— I feel like you said that because there's an audience, I feel like if there wasn’t an audience you wouldn’t have said that to Gerald.
Magnus: Yeah, you know what Gerald? I said that because there was an audience, and… [Justin laughs] I wouldn't have said it if there wasn’t an audience, and I didn’t mean that about Timothy, I'm sure he's great. It was just a joke that I made, and made it at your expense and Timothy's expense and that was uncalled for, and I bet Timothy's—
Justin: Wrap it up.
Griffin: Yeah he’s great. Look at the clock, holy shit, a tear falls from his eye he’s like, “we’re good.” Now, [audience laughs] what do you do?
Travis: Now Magnus— there's a door? Is there a door? You said a wooden wall.
Griffin: There's a set of stairs heading up to a porch with a front door.
Travis: I knock on the door?
Griffin: Roll a Dexterity saving throw.
Justin: All of us or just him?
Griffin: Just him.
Justin: Nice.
Travis: That is a 10.
Griffin: You start walking up the stairs, and as you do, you realize that they are quite slippery; there's a lot of ice actually on these stairs, you slip and fall down the stairs. Take 9 damage, make another Dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Sure. That is a 16.
Griffin: As you land on the floor there's a rumble throughout the cavern and a stalactite falls from the ceiling. You roll out of the way at the last second as it crashes into the floor.
Travis: How much damage did I take?
Griffin: You took 9 points of damage from the falling down the stairs.
Justin: No big deal.
Griffin: What do you do?
Travis: [crestfallen] I still didn’t get a chance to knock.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I try again.
Griffin: Roll a Dexterity saving throw.
[Audience laughs]
Clint: God, this is like Tin Cup.
Travis: That's a 13.
Griffin: You… slip and fall down the stairs!
Justin: [laughing] Can I just say Dad said this is like Tin Cup, and it is very much like Tin Cup, thank you Dad.
Griffin: You take 11 points of damage. You fell harder this time and you were made more tender by the first fall. The stalactite trap has already been activated. What! Do you do?
Taako: Wait! [Travis yells and tries again] Wait, Magnus—
Travis: [laughing] Nope.
[Audience and Travis laugh]
Griffin: Take 8 points of damage, you fall down the stairs again. You're gonna fucking die on these stairs.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: I run and jump.
Griffin: Okay, make an Acrobatics roll.
Travis: Acrobatics… 13.
Clint: Don’t, don’t…
Griffin: In the interest of fucking playing the rest of the game, you jump up the stairs, it's extremely close. What do you do?
Travis: [satisfied] Knock on the door.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: There's no answer.
Travis: Knock harder! I make an attack on the door with Phantom Fist…
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s a 14…
Clint: [crosstalk, to Justin] Are we— are we not playing anymore?
Travis: [crosstalk] 22, that’s a 22 against the door.
Justin: [crosstalk, to Clint] I’m— listen, I'll listen to this— I’ll watch this all day.
Clint: [crosstalk, agreeing with Justin] Yeah.
Griffin: It’s a thick— It is a thick, ogre door. You pound on it, no results, no answer, make a Dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Wait, the door dodged my attack?
Griffin: You just didn’t knock it down hard enough.
Travis: I have push with the Phantom Fist!
Griffin: We gotta keep going. Dexterity saving throw.
Clint: [laughing] We’re not going anywhere!
Travis: Nope. That’s an 11.
Griffin: Uh, you see the mail slot on the door slide open and a crossbow bolt fires out at you. You take 15 piercing damage as one shoots you in the gut. Hey, make a Dexterity saving throw.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: Nope.
Griffin: You slip and fall down the stairs, take 9 points of damage. Anybody else wanna try something!?
Taako: I feel like this is gonna work.
Clint: Yeah, I just wish I was videoing.
Travis: I’m… I’m almost bloodied, [crosstalk] in case anyone was wondering.
Justin: [crosstalk] Oh wait, hold on, hold on… Okay. Let me look at you… okay. I use the Hole Thrower— [laughs]— on the door.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Okay, you use the Hole Thrower, I won’t make you roll for it because it’s a— you’ll be able to make a big enough hole for you to get through.
Justin: [imitating throwing the hole] Th-woop!
Griffin: As you do that, a hole in the door opens up. Behind it, you do see a crossbow set up as a trap. You also see some sort of, um, hot cauldron under the door knob on their side that is making it very hot.
Travis: Fucking Home Alone?
Griffin: Yup!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: I will also say: the stair ice has been slipped on so much, it melted.
[Audience laughs; Justin and Travis chuckle]
Magnus: [proudly] You’re all welcome.
Taako: [laughing] My hero!
[They all chuckle.]
Griffin: What do you all do, someone else other than Magnus wanna play?
Justin: I crawl through the hole and kick the crossbow over.
Griffin: [resigned] Make a Dexterity saving— [he leans away from the mic]
[Audience laughs]
Justin: Nine. Pluuus—! Three.
[A pause, Audience laughs]
Griffin: Above the door a flame cannon activates and shoots your head. You take 20 fire damage and your head’s on fire.
Travis: This would be a good time for some healing.
Clint: Tough shit.
[Audience laughs]
Clint: I tried to heal before and got nothing but grief!
Griffin: Now that you are inside the building and you have a big hole and you all are in the door and you all are there, you all can see at the top of the stairs… you are in a foyer, where there are entrances to some other rooms around the first floor. At the top of the stairs you see an ogre. A big… big ol’ ogre at the top of the stairs…
Travis: A big juicy ogre.
Griffin: — who sees you and smiles as you are caught up in his traps. Through the door, Klaarg sees Taako’s head on fire and says:
Klaarg: You know what, I’m good, uh… uh, I’ll figure something else out, uh… I’m might go back to the Costco and get me one of them Cherub Joes and see if maybe that’ll pass. I’ll catch y’all— catch y'all on the next adventure!
Griffin: And he walks away out of the cave.
Taako: Bye!
Magnus: Bye, Klaarg!
Griffin: Gerald Loggins carefully pursues the three of you.
Clint: [dejected] Alright… Merle casts Mass Healing Word.
Travis: Thanks, Merle.
Griffin: Okay. What’s that get everybody?
Clint: [reading] ""Everyone you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.""
Griffin: [amused] That’s not very much health!
Clint: It’s ""mass"". [Travis: [in the background] This one.] Okay… that is a 3 plus…
Griffin: We’ll say 8! That’s 11 points of damage everybody heals, congratulations. Taako’s still on fire, who wants to go next?
Justin: Wait, 8?
Travis: I would like to… I would say Magnus has matured over time…
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I would like to look at the ogre and say,
Magnus: We’ve come for the Jeff Angel doll, and if you give it to me right now, we won’t murder you.
Griffin: Make a… what’s the threat one?
Travis: It isn’t a threat— [crosstalk] It’s just a simple conversation.
Griffin: [crosstalk] But…? [laughs] I think it’s Intimidation. You've got to be good at that.
Travis: Nope, nope. That was a 3.
Griffin: Okay, he nods his head yes, and the three of you are absolutely convinced that he is telling the truth. He begins to gesture into a bedroom on the second floor, gesturing you all to come up the stairs. Taako’s head is still on fire.
Travis: Magnus goes up the stairs. He has no reason not to!
Clint: Merle beats— [crosstalk] on his head?
Griffin: [interrupting] No! No, no, no— Magnus, your feet are stuck in tar. [audience laughs] You have to take your shoes off.
Justin: I put my hat— head out.
Griffin: Okay. [laughs]
Clint: Yeah, it’s just his hat!
Griffin: You pat your hat furiously, and the fire goes out.
Taako: Okay, you’re gonna pay for that.
Griffin: How?
Taako: That’s my favorite head.
Griffin: Sure!
Justin: Uh, I cast… [pauses, then laughs proudly] Levitate.
Griffin: Okay. On?
Justin: Me.
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: To. Go. Up. The— to the second floor without using the stairs.
Griffin: You do it. And on the way you see so many traps… you see so many traps, and you go ‘mm, good’. Do you tell your friends about all the traps?
Taako: Hey, there’s so many traps! You’re gonna freak out!
Griffin: As he says that, you all see immediately… some nails on the steps, and some paint cans hanging above you. Now that Taako has pointed them out, you can get around them safely. The ogre looks worried though, and runs off into the bedroom. And now you all have made it to the top of the stairs safely because of Taako’s help. What do you do?
Merle: [unenthusiastic] Thank you, Taakooo.
Taako: Feel good about myself, I guess!
Griffin: For sure.
Magnus: Okay, so, he ran into the bedroom. Guys, I think he… wants us to follow him.
[a few people in the audience whoop suggestively]
Griffin: Gerald says,
Gerald: That’s a good point, I’ll, uh—
Taako: What the fu—?
[Audience laughs]
Gerald: I’ll check the uh, I'll check the— the— first floor to be safe. You all— you all, get ‘im. Uhh… Oh, this is fun. [He chuckles.] You all… [a beat] get ‘im. [laughs]
Griffin: And he heads down to the first floor to look around.
Travis: What do we do?
Justin: It’s not my turn.
Travis: Merle?
Justin: I did that great— [laughs] that great thing where I levitated.
Clint: Merle casts… [pauses]
Justin: Kay. [Pauses, waiting] It’s a bad start, but…
Clint: Sh… I already did the weather thing, didn’t I?
Griffin: Ah, you can do it again, I don’t give a shit.
Clint: Alright, then, I’ll save it! [Laughs]
Griffin: Dad elects not to take a turn!
Clint: No, uh! Merle… walks into the bedroom.
[Audience laughs and cheers]
Griffin: Hey, does a 23 beat your AC? Yes. A giant tarantula jumps— [laughs] jumps on top of you and begins biting you furiously.
Travis: As Taako and Magnus look on.
Griffin: As [mumbles]… just watch. That is 18 points of poison damage, you are bit, and you are bit, and bit, and bit. You are also a dwarf, so half that. You’re welcome for me remembering that, our extremely arcane rule about dwarves.
Justin: I walk over and kick the spider.
Griffin: Okay, do it. Roll a d20 with your, just Attack roll.
Justin: [Crosstalk] 2! I had a 2!
[Audience Laughs]
Travis: [Crosstalk]
Griffin: You kick it— you kick the tarantula right in the fang. Take… [audience laughs] Take 11 points of poison damage.
Justin: [Laughs]
Travis: I hit it with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Justin: [Crosstalk] No, you can’t…
Griffin: It dies, it dies, it dies, it dies, it dies, it dies, it dies, you cut it in half, it dies. Go ahead and roll.
Travis: Nope, hold on.
Griffin: Why did you roll…?
Travis: I rolled a one, but I get a re-roll on one because I have [crosstalk] a lucky thing…
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Oh, okay, you’re right.
Travis: The tooth necklace. So that was a 13 plus… I dunno, like, 12 probably.
Griffin: Yeah, you’re good. I can’t believe you remembered a magic item you have, I’m so proud!
Travis: Yeah, only the one that keeps me from fucking up real bad.
Griffin: Yeah, the spider just disintegrates, it died. Um, and there, you see in this bedroom, a Candlenight bush. It’s a progressive family, they keep the Candlenight bush in the child’s bedroom. It spoils the surprise Candlenights morning, but it’s convenient for him, I suppose. He looks kind of scared as you all breach—
Travis: Wait, is the ogre a kid?
Griffin: It’s an ogre, it’s a big ogre, it’s hard to tell. [Whispers] Yeah, it’s a kid. And, um, [Audience laughs] he’s standing over the Candlenights bush, a single wrapped present is under the bush, [Audience ‘aww’s] and as you all break into the room altogether, he looks down and, [crosstalk]
Travis: [Crosstalk] He’s a—
Griffin: He looks at you all scared, and his chin starts to wobble a little bit, and then, through the windows in his room, you see two giant eyes appear and you hear a big booming voice say:
Parent Ogre: Cozgul! We are so sorry we forgot you at home during trip to blood pits! Can you ever forgive us?
Griffin: And the little ogre just breaks out in tears, and jumps out the window to its mommy and daddy, and—
Travis: Is the present still there?
Griffin: No, he picks it up—
Travis: Fuck!
Clint: Travis, why did you say anything?
Griffin: And the big ogre says,
Parent Ogre: You there, small ones! Thank you for keeping our Cozgul safe during our absence. How can we repay you?
Magnus: Give… give us the toy?
Taako: Well, we…
Parent Ogre: Absolutely not! That thing was super hard to find. But! We can do you one better!
Taako: Oh no…
Parent Ogre: I can show you the secret location of the Turbo Jeff Factory.
[Audience cheers]
Justin: [Laughs]
Parent Ogre: You go there and find all the Turbo Jeffs you need!
Magnus: Okay!
Merle: Thank you!
Griffin: He scoops you up, puts ‘em in his pocket, and starts walking away. Gerald Loggins approaches and says,
Gerald: Oh, you guys— you guys go with the—?
Magnus: Yeah, you follow, Gerald or whatever.
Gerald: Alright.
Griffin: And he just starts sprinting, trying to keep up with the giant gait of these ogres. You follow the ogres through the fastest route out of the caverns, and they point you in the directions of the Turbo Jeff— the direction, there’s just one— of the Turbo Jeff Factory. It’s a surprisingly short walk, you’re there in minutes. Although, it takes considerably longer for Gerald Loggins to catch up. It is secluded, built into a span of a narrow mountain pass, it’s a castle-like stone structure, reaching up into the sky, lit with industrial fluorescent lights hanging from its roof. Inside you hear the noise of machinery whirring and clanging, and then you hear Gerald Loggins, deeply out of breath behind you as he catches up. And he gives a faint smile, and he says:
Gerald: [Pause as he catches his breath] …gonna have some stories from this one, huh?
Taako: Yeah, this is easily one of the most exciting things that’s ever happened to us.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: You notice that some of his clothes are badly singed, and he has some speckles of hot tar peppered across his face—
Justin: Don’t feel bad for Gerald Loggins.
Travis: Don’t.
Griffin: —Which you assume he got from the—
Travis: What you don’t know? He’s been embezzling.
Griffin: He says,
Gerald: I sure hope my, uh… my sweet Timothy appreciates the tremendous sacrifices I’ve made tonight.
Merle: He won’t.
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Clint: Kids!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: And like a true gentleman, Gerald steps forward and opens the door to the factory open for the three of you.
Taako: Thanks, Gerald. Um… honestly, I assumed we would have taken the break by now, so I’m not sure what to do next.
Travis: We enter the Factory!
Justin: Have you learned nothing?
Griffin: [Crosstalk] You roll a Dexterity—
Travis: [Crosstalk] You mean you think the factory is booby trapped too?
Griffin: The Home Alone segment of the show is— that would be great though! When you least expect it, on an adventure next year, I’m just gonna put more Home Alone traps in it.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: You all step foot into a loud, expansive, yet orderly scene. Conveyor belts are collecting different components as they pour from dozens of large molds suspended from the ceiling. The belts converge on a large, single rotating platform, where dozens of thin metal arms grab various appendages and snap them together into humanoid… bird form. From there, they fall into a chute where they’re painted, polished, and wrapped neatly in a package. Then, they’re collected by hooks, that pull them upward into a room, suspended by a— in a— on a catwalk. This is like an episode of fucking How It’s Made, man, this is good shit!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Inside, you can see a light flashing rhythmically as each completed doll enters and exits the room. Each time, you see a silhouette of a humanoid figure with his arms raised over his head and hear muffled chanting coming from inside. From there, they drop down one last chute, and land in a neat pattern on a series of palettes. This is it, the epicenter of the Turbo Jeff phenomenon.
Justin: Nice.
Travis: We grab like twenty of them.
Justin: Yeah, I just walk over and grab as— like, literally as many as I can carry.
Griffin: As you take a step forward, from behind the machinery on the ground level, you hear someone clear their throat as the four of you… take a step forward. I don’t know why I put that in there twice. They clap their hands, speakers lower from long metal rods from the ceiling, and begin playing a song.
[Music starts]
Griffin: A single spotlight shines down from the ceiling onto the center of the room. You hear the rapping of talons against the factory’s steel floor as a figure approaches the spotlight, then, he steps into view: two long, powerful wings, bare rippling chest, sweatbands around each wrist, and of course jean shorts that end just beyond the knee; Jeff Angel finds his light and flexes to the beat of his theme song.
[Audience Cheers]
Griffin: He says,
Jeff Angel: Jeff Angel has got to start locking the door to his factory!
Merle: Or at least booby trapping it!
Jeff Angel: That’s a good idea, too. Tell me the truth— you should always tell the truth to parents, cops, and strangers! Are you here for a Turbo Jeff Action Doll?
Taako: Yeah!
Magnus: A couple, I think.
Griffin: The room up on the catwalk flashes again, and you hear louder chanting. He says,
Jeff Angel: Is it for some kids?
Magnus: Yeah…
Taako: Just one.
Merle: The others we’re gonna eBay!
Jeff Angel: Are the kids sick?
Taako: Yeah…
Merle: He has an eye condition… he doesn’t…
Taako: No… They aren’t sick.
Jeff Angel: Even— oh. Still good enough!
Taako: They have astigmatism!
Merle: Yeah!
Jeff Angel: That’s all Jeff Angel needs to hear. Go nuts!
Griffin: And he gestures to all of the, Jeff Angel… Turbo Jeff Dolls. There’s another flash, Jeff Angel’s eyes dart nervously to the suspended chamber on the catwalk and back to you.
Jeff Angel: So, just the one Turbo Jeff each? Maybe you got some cousins you want to ship them off to?
Magnus: [Crosstalk] Uh, yeah, I mean we— yeah—
Taako: [Laughs, Crosstalks] I guess… we’ll uh, take like four or five each.
Magnus: Yeah, I got some cousins.
Taako: Yeah, I’ve got a cousin. Couple cousins.
Griffin: Gerald Loggins walks over to the pile and starts picking some up, he’s got tears in his eyes, [Audience ‘aww’s] his quest is almost come to an end. You see another flash up in the room with the catwalk and hear even louder, more frantic chanting.
Justin: I’m gonna roll a Perception check on the— it’s a 2, it doesn’t matter.
Magnus: Hey Jeff, what’s happening up there?
Clint: Merle casts Zone of Truth!
[Audience cheers loudly]
Griffin: I got a critical failure.
Clint: How?
Travis: Tell us your secrets, Jeff!
Justin: Now Griffin has to tell you a truth!
Jeff Angel: Uh, quality control? Nope. We’re doing… evil stuff up there.
Griffin: He’s like clutching his throat.
Jeff Angel: Ah! Ah! [bird-like] Squawk!
Magnus: Jeff, why you doing evil stuff?
Jeff Angel: Listen. Listen!
[Laughter]
Griffin: He flexes.
Clint: [Crosstalk] Oh yeah!
Travis: [Crosstalk] Really weird flex, but okay.
Justin: That’s a weird flex, but okay.
Jeff Angel: Listen!
[Audience cheers]
Travis: I went— I just said it!
Griffin: Travis just said it.
Travis: [crosstalk] I literally—
Justin: You didn’t— you didn’t nail it. You didn’t nail it. Griffin will edit yours out.
Travis: Okay, okay.
Jeff Angel: You come into my factory, uninvited. I offer you free merch. I feel like you’re just throwing it back in my face.
[Audience laughs]
Jeff Angel: Gang! No, it’s me, Jeff Angel. Eat your greens, tell the truth, call your dad, all that stuff? There’s no way I’d be capable of getting into the kind of nefarious business you seem to be accusing me of. Unless…
Justin: [Together] Unless…
Travis: [Together] Unless…
Griffin: And then what happens next happens so fast your eyes can barely process it. Jeff Angel isn’t in front of you anymore, he’s just on Gerald Loggins, he lifts him into the air with his powerful wings, then flings him over his shoulder and does a backwards somersault, diving him into the ground, and suplexes Gerald so hard that both of his shoes go flying off.
[Audience Cheers]
Griffin: And Jeff Angel looks at the three of you, kneeling over Gerald’s crumpled form on the floor and says,
Jeff Angel: Unless I’m makin’ one hell of a heel turn.
Griffin: We’re going to go to intermission, we’ll be right back!
{Intermission 48:12 - 51:50}
Griffin: Roll— what did you all get for the roll?
Justin: Fourteen.
Travis: I got a 14 as well.
Griffin: Who’s got more Dexterity? Probably Taako, right?
Justin: Yep.
Clint: Nineteen.
[Audience cheers]
Clint: Is this one of those I didn’t want to go— to win?
Griffin: I swear to— I don’t know, dude, but we've been doing live shows actually, like, pretty consistently this year compared to previous years— Merle always fucking goes first. You always crush the initiative roll. It’s just— it’s fine, it’s just weird, isn’t it? I guess you get to roll twice. Anyway, this is nothing— Merle, you are up first. Let me, set the scene for you just in case you are meat-drunk from all the Lambert’s we ate backstage.
Jeff Angel is facing down your party menacingly. Behind him, the machinery of this factory still in operation forming pieces, putting them together, packaging them, and sending them up to a room on the catwalk where bright lights are periodically flashing before being loaded up for shipment. At your feet is Gerald Loggins who has just been put directly in the toilet. What do you do?
[Silence, no one answers]
Griffin: You had… 20 minutes to think about this.
Clint: But I didn’t.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Well, there it is. You can’t argue with that, Griffin.
Justin: He’s got you there.
Clint: I have a hunch. I’m gonna heal Gerald Loggins.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Do it.
Clint: Which I’m not— he’s not really that good a healer guy— What do I roll, d4? 2 plus my spell cast—
Travis: He healed him for 10.
Griffin: Which heals Gerald Loggins back up to max.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: He is a small—
Clint: You know, a thank you would be nice.
Griffin: Thank you. Gerald Loggins, I’ve just decided, his D&D class is stepdad.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: He says— he like leaps up from the floor, he says,
Gerald: Wow, I haven't felt this good in— in years, thanks, Merle. I actually haven't felt this good since Timothy… became my stepson. I feel good about, um, myself, I guess, thank you, Merle.
Merle: It's good to be appreciated for a change, thank you Gerald.
Justin: You healed him so hard he, like, healed Gerald’s sciatica that's been bothering him for years.
Griffin: Next up is Jeff Angel, who points at Merle and says,
Jeff Angel: Hey! I just finished beating that dude’s ass!
Griffin: And he runs up to you and does a move that I've written down here as Punch Storm. It’s 21 versus AC, Merle.
Clint: Uh…
Travis: Yes.
Clint: Yeah, it hits.
Griffin: He bludgeons you for 22 bludgeoning damage. As a storm of punches—
Travis: You actually have disadvantage because I’m standing near Merle and [crosstalk] I’m a protection fighter.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ooo, Punch Storm! [audience cheers] Fifteen versus AC.
Travis: Nope! Dad has a 19. I’ll speak for him. [audience laughs]
Clint: I know how to play the game!
Travis: Do you?
Griffin: Oh, the evidence would suggest otherwise. The—
Travis: I like to imagine that Jeff just walked over to punch him and I went “Hold on!”
Griffin: “Hold on!” You put your shield up and just held it there while plink plink plink plink plink plink plink! A storm of— a storm of punches comes out of Jeff Angel’s arms. For his second action, Magnus, make a wisdom saving throw.
Travis: It’s a fifteen.
Griffin: Uh, you have failed. You see him wave his arm in front of his face and turn invisible. [audience cheers] He— when he reappears, he is in the process of choke-slamming you to the ground for a eighteen points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: That’s fine.
Griffin: That is the end of his turn, we are moving on to Taako from TV!
Justin: What is the— I know there’s Jeff— what’s, like, the arrangement of the bad people?
Griffin: There’s just Jeff that you can see. There’s a bunch of sort of machinery putting the Turbo Jeff action dolls together, there’s a room suspended on a catwalk above you, where, Jeff Angel, I guess confessed that bad things are happening up there. That’s sort of in the center of the room. You all sort of have line of sight on it. Other than that, there’s no other bad people. Unless Gerald Loggins is bad! You haven’t really had a long discussion with him to dial into that. He’s not bad though; he’s great!
Justin: I’m gonna… Um… I’m gonna make a run at Jeff Angel and as I’m running at Jeff Angel I’m gonna tackle Jeff Angel, but as I do I’m gonna pop a piece of Mockingbird Gum. Okay?
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Okay, so I’m running at him, I pop a piece of Mockingbird Gum, and I tackle him. Then I shout into his microphone:
Taako (in Jeff Angel’s voice): Guys! He’s killing me! Tell him the plan, quick!
[Griffin laughs and the audience applauds]
Griffin: This is— Okay— This is like four rolls!
Justin: Would I roll to chew— Okay, okay— Would I roll to chew gum?
Griffin: No.
Justin: Would I roll to talk?
Griffin: No.
Justin: Would I roll to walk towards someone?
Griffin: Now be careful! You would roll to tackle and to deceive. We’ll fold—
Justin: To tackle— Okay.
Griffin: We’ll fold it into one. You’re not going to hurt Jeff Angel with this roll. This is the tradeoff—
Justin: No, this is not an attack roll.
Griffin: But you can roll a deception—
Justin: Of course I’m not gonna— Okay, here’s the thing, I had to get close to him— I could have just hugged him, like it doesn’t matter— close to him to be able to use his microphone and to make it unclear where the voice is coming from.
Griffin: Make a deception check with advantage because of the great gum. Even though in a previous live show you did say you chew all the pieces of mockingbird gum— I believe it was the pirate episode—
Travis: No he didn’t, he tucked it behind his ear.
Griffin: Sure, sure.
Justin: Chronologically speaking this one actually comes before the other one. [audience and Griffin laugh]
Griffin: Except it doesn’t because Dracula was in Act 1!
Justin: It’s a diff— It’s Gary Oldman Dracula and that was Bela Lugosi.
Griffin: [laughs] It’s a third Dracula! [crosstalk] It’s not the Dracula—
Justin: [crosstalk] It’s yet another Dracula.
Griffin: Fuck it, fine. Whatever.
Justin: It’s Leslie Nielson’s Dracula: Dead and Loving It. [audience laughter] Um, yeah so I got a seventeen.
Griffin: Oh yeah, that does it. With that, uh, the, shit. The shutters of the room above you slide open. Inside there you see the process that you kind of figured out through the shadows that you saw every time the light flashed. Dolls are being brought up into this room on the conveyor belt, brought to the center of the room where a figure is casting some sort of spell or enchantment on them before they’re dropped down on delivery pallets. Only now with the shutters open you do see that figure. He is leaning out of the room, sort of looking worried that Jeff Angel is being destroyed. You see a shitty brown suit, you see just peeking out on top of the window a little bit of diaper… [audience laughter] You see the form of Cherub Joe, the manager of Jeff Angel, who looks down at you and says:
Cherub Joe: Uh, Jeff you— Oh I see. [audience laughter] This is one of those uh… one of those ruses, huh? Did you do— Hey you! With the hat! That’s burned up! [pause] Did you do a ruse on me!?
Taako: You’ve had a ruse from the best, my friend.
Griffin: He nods his head.
Cherub Joe: Yes. Yes. [Travis laughs] Well, uh. It’s a cliche but… you seen too much. [audience laughs]
Griffin: And he flicks his wrists outward and just like that, from the delivery palettes, you see fists punching out of plastic. [Audience “ooh!”s] All of the Turbo Jeff dolls come to life and begin springing from their packaging. This swarm of Turbo Jeff dolls is animated and now approaching your party. Next in the order is Magnus.
Travis: Well, they’ve made one mistake, Griffin.
Griffin: Okay. They’ve brought a thousand Turbo Jeffs to a gun fight?
[Audience laughs]
Travis: They let Magnus loose… in a factory that you described having a bunch of thin metal robot arms.
Griffin: Sure.
[Audience cheers]
Travis: So I’m just gonna go ahead and rip those all up.
Griffin: Sure, those are all sort of suspended on this rotating, circular platform in the middle of the room, still putting pieces of new Turbo Jeffs together.
Travis: Do you need me to roll for that?
Griffin: Yeah, roll a… strength saving throw.
Travis: Let’s see, a strength check, that’s a 26.
Griffin: Oh shit. [Audience cheers] You get them all, and with that—
Travis: And then I hold them out like fans between each like, finger, so I’m holding basically— let’s see, one, two, three—
Griffin: Yeah, you look wild, man.
Travis: Yeah, like Wolverine only with robot hands, and then I start just sweeping the Jeff dolls. Knocking them down.
Griffin: They are— I have them in here as a swarm, so this is just gonna be an attack roll. Use like, your Chance Lance stats against them. Obviously you are using a bunch of metal arms, so there won’t be…
Travis: That is a 16?
Griffin: That beats their AC.
Travis: And I hit them.
Griffin: Yeah, you sure do. Roooll… uhh, shit man. 2d10 plus your strength modifier. I’ll give you that. [Travis: ‘Kay] I mean it’s a bunch of metal arms, I don’t know y’all, I’m just fucking making it up.
Travis: … nine… nine, 18 plus 10, 28?
Griffin: Yeah. You clear out a good number of them. Like a third of the dolls you just see arms and legs go flying, and now that you’ve ripped all the arms off, the conveyor belt has come to a complete stop. All of the Turbo Jeffs that were being put together are sort of halted in the middle of their process, and the Turbo Jeffs that go down in pieces stay down. Next in the order iiiis, Cherub Joe. Cherub Joe, hmm. Merle, make a dexterity saving throw.
Clint: 14 plussss—
Justin: One.
Travis: No six!
Griffin: What!?
Clint: 20!
Travis: He has proficiency in it.
Griffin: Okay yeah, with a 20 you see a bunch of objects in the room begin to animate. There’s actually like a little dining area for employees, which I guess is just Cherub Joe and Jeff Angel? [Audience laughs] And the tables and chairs in this dining area begin to animate and walk towards you like the Mickey sorcerer scene from Fantasia, and then they all just fling themselves in your direction, and the two of see Merle just… dodging out of the way and he is not struck by any of the tables and chairs.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: The next in the order—
Clint: [Interrupting] Now wait, wait, wait! Now just picture how cool that looks.
Griffin: It looks very cool. Next in the order is the Turbo Jeffs, who have been weakened by Magnus’s— let’s see. Uh, Taako. Let’s make a strength contest of it, what do you say?
Justin: Me versus a tiny action figure?
Griffin: Versus dozens and dozens of tiny action figures, who are ganging up on you. Ooh, that’s a 17 for me.
Justin: That’s a 19 for me.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: [away from the mic] What the fuck! [He laughs] They all come up to you, a bunch of tiny bird men Jeff Angels, and they start like… grabbing at your feet— and your ankles— and just tryna pick ya’ up— tryna pick ya’ up—
Justin: But they can’t.
Griffin: They’re still dolls, yeah, they don’t succeed.
Justin: Yeah, they can’t do it.
Travis: They actually don’t have muscle mass as dolls. [Griffin: And in fact in— ] Unless in animating them… has it put like blood and muscle and sinew in them?
Griffin: Now let’s explore that.
[Audience laughs]
Justin: And souls? Are there souls and free will?
Griffin: And choice, yeah. I’m gonna say—
Travis: [in a Jeff Angel doll voice] “I don’t wanna fight these guys!” “Oh you better!” “[in defeat] N’oh.”
Griffin: It’s the Candlenights special, so I’m gonna say no? On that one? But because of their failed roll, you immediately stomp the ones who are just under your feet, taking out a few more Turbo Jeff dolls in the process. Next up is… ah, god. Gerald Loggins, I don’t know why I included him in on this. [Audience laughs] Gerald Loggins, he gets in a fierce battle with one Turbo Jeff doll. [Audience cheers] And he— he loses it. [Audience ‘aww’s] This Turbo Jeff doll has him pinned to the ground. Merle, you’re up.
Magnus: [laughing] Save— save Gerald!
Griffin: [laughing] No, I won’t— I actually will— You are not allowed to spend both of your turns in a row saving Gerald Loggins.
Clint: I hadn’t intended on it.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Let me open— !
Griffin: His magic glowing book!
[Audience cheers]
Clint: Magic glowing book. That changes color.
[Audience “ooh”s]
Griffin: You got like two more live shows where the audience is gonna be impressed by that.
Clint: I know. Especially since I broke it.
Griffin: [in disbelief] You fucking broke it!
[Audience laughs]
Clint: I broke it, yeah. Merle casts Guardian of Faith!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: That ol’ chestnut? Alright.
Clint: To protect us from the swarm of—
Griffin: I like that, I like that.
Travis: Jeffs.
Clint: Jeffs.
Griffin: Remind me, do you have the card out in front of you?
Clint: I certainly do, Griffin.
Griffin: Read me that please.
Clint: [reading] “A large spectral guardian—”
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: “— appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming—” Well, but we make her distinct.
Travis: [crosstalk] It’s fine. It’s Della Reese.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, it’s fine. It is Della Reese, okay Della Reese appears and brings out her mighty flaming sword and she just gets to work. Usually Della Reese gets in a defensive pose and just waits, she appears like, mid-swing with her sword and is just cutting these Turbo Jeff dolls to ribbons.
[Audience cheers]
Clint: Because she thinks Candlenights should be about the candles and not the presents.
Griffin: Exactly. It is a purposeful, principled slaughter as she takes out all but just a small handful, a couple dozen of the Turbo Jeff dolls. I’m gonna add another person to the order. Taako.
Justin: Yeah?
Griffin: Mmm make a… perception check.
[Clint laughs]
Justin: Siiiiiix— [with Clint] teen! Plus six, 22.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: You feel something moving in your pocket. [Clint laughs] And it begins to climb up your shirt and take you by the throat. It is the tiny toy Cherub Joe that you [Justin: No!] got at the Fantasy Costco earlier.
[Audience cheers]
Travis: Not like this!
Justin: I knew it would come in handy later, I just thought it would be for me.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: He is… still one tiny doll. So I don’t know, he’s probably like a necktie at this point, trying to choke you, but to no avail. What do you do with your friend here?
Justin: I am going to— I’m gonna immolate him.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: [laughing] Okay. That’s a free— I’ll give you that as a free reaction.
Justin: It’s almost like a— a uh, that cantrip like prestidigitation, just like poof. Gone.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s all you need. He is melting. His wax is melting, and he looks up at you.
Travis: [in response to someone in the audience] Don’t “aww” him!
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: He looks up at you and he says—
Travis: He is an evil doll!
Justin: He was a bad toy to start with!
Griffin: You drop him because he’s on fire, and he lands on his feet. His torso and head is melting, and he looks up at you and he says:
Cherub Joe doll: [slow and slightly distorted] Daaaddyyy…
[Justin and audience laugh]
Travis: [as the doll] “I was just trying to hug!”
Griffin: Next up is Jeff Angel. Everybody make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: 20! Nat 20!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Good roll!
Clint: Nat 11!
[Audience cheers a little less]
Justin: That’s a 21 from your boy.
Clint: Oh wait, wait, wait. I add six.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: What?
Clint: Right? 17.
Travis: Dexterity saving throw.
Griffin: The three of you see Jeff Angel stop and consider his actions, then he takes a step over towards Gerald Loggins, and grabs him by the ankles and begins spinning him around in a beautiful whirlwind attack. Taako and Magnus, you just kind of like… you step back. He’s still a small man, you understand the physics of how to get out of the way of him. Merle, you do not. You get clocked by a spinning Gerald Loggins. Take 11 points of bludgeoning damage.
Clint: But my roll was higher than theirs!
Travis: No it was not.
Griffin: No it wasn’t.
Travis: Is 17 higher than 20 or 21? You taught us math!
[Audience laughs]
Clint: Too well, my friend. Too well.
Griffin: Next—
Clint: Wait, wait, wait, how much? Take off how much?
Griffin: 11 points of—
Clint: One?
Griffin: One? Eleven points of bludgeoning damage. Next up, he has a second attack. Magnus. Let’s have a strength contest.
Travis: Alright. Fuck off.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: I got a 23.
Travis: Oh boyee. Umm. That is… better than mine, but I’m gonna use Indomitable.
Griffin: Okay. Roll again.
Justin: [muttering] Just take it. Just take it for once.
Travis: Okay that’s a 27.
Justin: [crosstalk] [muttering] Just what is this strength contest.
Griffin: 27. He— he runs in and the two of you grapple—
Travis: Okay, so, I’ll give it some flavor: He starts to go down. “Uhg!” and then Magnus flexes and pushes back up.
Griffin: Yeah I like that. You two are grappling each other, and you can tell he’s trying to just take you to Suplex City, but you take him to Suplex City. [Audience cheers] He crashes to the ground behind you, and takes 18 points of bludgeoning damage from the reverse suplex. And when that happens, something weird also happens. You see a little split form the side of his arm, and from that you actually see some stuffing coming out of him. [Audience “ooh”s] Next in the order is Taako!
Justin: Uhh…
Griffin: Not— oh sorry, holy shit. He’s a bird. Like cotton stuffing. [Audience laughs] [laughing] Thank you. Somebody sitting right in front of me was like “Mmm, stuffing.” And I was like “oh shit there’s— that could mean…” [Audience continues to laugh] It could mean a lot of things.
Travis: [laughing] It is pretty close to Thanksgiving.
Griffin: It’s also close to Thanksgiving, yes. Taako.
Justin: What’s the situation, how many haters do we have left?
Griffin: There’s not that many dolls left, you’ve got a slightly injured Jeff Angel on the floor with some stuffing coming out of him, and a yet-unharmed Cherub Joe still up in the suspended room on the catwalk. [Justin: Okay, uh—] Also I’ll give you this: on the catwalk, you hear other sounds of activity that you can’t quite see from your vantage point. That’s all I’ll give ya.
Justin: Okay, you know what—
Griffin: [interrupting] If you’re gonna set that room on fire or something, I’m not gonna make you not do it, I’m just— I wanna paint the scene for ya.
Justin: I— you know what, I’m just gonna blast that room with Sunbeam. ‘Cause I’m tired of it.
Griffin: Okay. What’s that do now?
Justin: [reading] That’s “a beam of brilliant light that flashes out from my hand in a five foot wide, sixty foot long line—”
Griffin: That’s a long fucking beam, dog.
Justin: It’s a big beam, baby.
Travis: I love that what just happened was Justin was like, “what’s up with that room”, and Griffin was like, “just so you know, there might be other people in there”, and Justin was like “fuck it”.
Griffin: I’m gonna cut it with my lightsaber.
Travis: I’m gonna nuke it with the sun.
Justin: It’s not gonna be like, a charity.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Do you roll, or I roll?
Travis: You don’t know!
Justin: Constitution saving throw for everybody in there.
Griffin: Oh boy.
Travis: All the orphans and everything.
Griffin: 14 is not gonna do it.
Justin: Nope.
Griffin: The other thing in the room instantly fails.
Justin: Okay. [in realization] Aww no…
Griffin: No, you’re fine.
Justin: Okay. Creature takes six d8 radiant damage. Can you roll for me? Do you have that little dumaflache you can roll with, [Griffin: Sure.] I don’t wanna roll a d8 six times. That sounds incredibly boring. [Audience laughs] These people paid a lot of money to be here… this beautiful venue that Willie Nelson made…
Griffin: I got a 34. [Justin: Okay.] With a 34 you hit— you hit Cherub—
Justin: Wait. What?
Griffin: 34.
Justin: Oh, 34 damage. [laughing] Sorry I spaced out for a little bit. [Audience laughs] I thought that was your roll.
Griffin: 34 points of fiery damage. With that you blast Cherub Joe directly, and he falls to the floor. The beam is so wide and so big—
Justin: He’s also blinded.
Griffin: He’s— fine. [laughs] The other figure— the other thing in the room is not. With your very powerful beam, sixty feet, it cuts through the fucking ceiling of this factory. It also cuts the catwalk in half. It swings down, falling and dropping the room that it was holding, which crashes into the ruined machinery below. And tumbling out of this big crumpled mess, you see a fairly large safe, that tumbles to your feet.
Justin: Oh, nice!
Griffin: Cherub Joe is… fucked up; Jeff Angel is… not great; not that many dolls left. Next in the order is Magnus Burnsides.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: Magnus is having a choice here.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: A choose-your-own-adventure. On one hand, he looks at his thieves tools, and he looks at the safe.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: On the other hand, he looks at his Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom and he looks at Jeff Angel.
Griffin: Yah. [a pause] This is like the guy looking at a not-his-girlfriend meme where— [he and audience laugh] I get you. The Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom is walking by you on the street and looks very attractive to you.
Travis: I’m gonna go for the safe.
Griffin: [surprised] Oh, wow, okay.
[Audience cheers]
Travis: I’m gonna crack it.
Griffin: I stand corrected. Roll, what is it, you roll— you’re proficient with your thieves tools, [Travis: Yes.] so you get proficiency bonus, roll a d20. Wow, have you ever picked a fucking lock before?
Travis: No. It’s 19.
Justin: Wait, is this the moment you’re gonna do that?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Nah, he—
Clint: [crosstalk] Is this when you wanna do it?
Travis: Listen, a safe is personal— I’ve matured a lot over the years.
Justin: You’ve matured, you’re just gonna pick a safe in the middle of a fight like a mature adult.
Travis: Yes.
[Audience laughs]
Magnus: Everybody stop! [as if opening the safe] tick tick tick… tick… click-click-click-click!
Griffin: Yeah sorry I just had to roll initiative, you pop the safe open and tumbling out of it you see— well, first you see a few feathers that pop out, and then rolling out of the safe you see the somewhat emaciated form of Jeff Angel.
[Audience “ooh”s]
Travis: That’s what I thought.
Griffin: Jeff Angel crawls out of his safe and tries to stand to his feet, you can tell he’s been severely weakened by his time… in a safe. [Audience laughs] He says— [crosstalk] he says,
Travis: [crosstalk] And then with my—
Jeff Angel: [a long pause] Where are my jean shorts?
Travis: Is he nude?
Griffin: He is also [laughing] nude.
Travis: Um. Is he covered in his own droppings?
Griffin: No! Je— this isn’t Seven!
[Audience laughs]
Travis: No, it’s like a— like a pigeon. Okay. I’m going to then use my action surge… [Griffin: Yes.] to then throw a Chance Lance at the fake Jeff Angel.
Griffin: I love it.
Travis: Te— uh, 20?
Griffin: Yes. That is a hit. On the fake Jeff Angel.
[Travis fumbles around looking for his dice]
Griffin: Where is it? Where is it?
Travis: I have so many dice!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh shit. Oh god, oh no.
Clint: Use one of mine.
Travis: 3 plus 4… 7 damage with the Chance Lance
Griffin: Okay, that's not a ton of damage, as you know, but it does a decent amount. You stab right through him and now you can tell this is— this is— I mean you probably already knew [crosstalk] it was not the real Jeff Angel; but this one is a stuffed sort of animated golem. He takes 7 points of damage.
Travis: [crosstalk] I just took Jeff Angel out of his safe, yeah!
Magnus: Guys, I’m starting to think that’s not the real Jeff Angel.
Griffin: Next up is Cherub Joe. Cherub Joe, oh Cherub Joe what do you do? My sweet Cherub Joe.
Travis: It’s become a ballad now.
Griffin: Cherub Joe you’re probably going to die before you get another turn, Cherub Joe. Everybody make a dexterity saving throw, including you Gerald Loggins and Jeff Angel. [shouting excitedly] Gerald Loggins got a nat 20, fuck yeah! [Audience cheers] Real Jeff Angel got an 18.
Travis: I got a 10.
Justin: That’s an 8 from ya boy.
Travis: You don’t have any pluses to your dex saving throw?
Justin: That’s an 11 from your boy.
Griffin: Wowzers. And Merle?
Travis: [makes a splat noise] Nat 1.
Griffin: Nat 1.
Clint: No, it’s a 5.
Travis: Oh, I thought you rolled this one.
Griffin: Alright here’s what I'll give you. Cherub Joe reaches up with his hand and twists it and animates some objects; he animates these vats of molten plastic above that are pouring pieces of Jeff Angel into the molds. And with that you see bolts start shooting out of these vats and it tilts over and begins to dump hot plastic on all three of you, and in one heroic tackle, Gerald Loggins dives into the three of you [Audience cheers] pushing you out of the way of the deluge. [A pause] He gets a little bit on his legs.
Travis: His beautiful, beautiful legs.
Griffin: His beautiful, perfect—
Justin: He is killed instantly.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: But luckily his slacks are functional enough!
Griffin: His slacks fend off the molten plastic—
[Audience cheers]
Travis: [crosstalk] He has +1 slacks.
Justin: [crosstalk] Wait, which part of the slacks were burned, the bottoms?
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Okay. I rip Gerald’s pants off and toss them to Jeff!
[Audience cheers]
Clint: You pantsed Gerald Loggins!? [crosstalk] He saves our lives—
Justin: [crosstalk] I pantsed Gerald Loggins.
Travis: [crosstalk] It’s for the greater good!
Justin: It’s for the greater good, and he needs his spinach, baby!
Griffin: Gerald Loggins stands up, molten plastic pouring down his ruined calves [Justin starts laughing] and says,
Gerald: Wow, I never really knew, [a burst of laughter from Justin] I guess people are capable of so much more than they think when they’re pushed to their— [more laughter from Justin]
Griffin: Then Taako rips his fucking pants off [another laugh from Justin] and because he’s a wizard, he just throws them [Justin continues laughing] at Jeff Angel’s dick and they’re on him. [Audience cheers] Gerald Loggins accepts this. [Justin and Travis laugh] Next up—
Travis: As he accepts so much of his life.
[Audience ‘aww’s]
Griffin: Next up is real Jeff Angel. Justin McElroy can you look at the dice?
Justin: [A long, dramatic pause] It's a 20. [Audience cheers] Those jean shorts—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Real Jeff Angel—
Travis: They were actually I think like khaki shorts but we’ll go with it.
Griffin: You see his dilapidated muscles instantly regrow [Travis laughs] as the shorts are thrown onto his body and with that he looks at fake Jeff Angel, says,
Jeff Angel: Nope, your very existence is kind of like not telling the truth.
Griffin: And lifts him up into the air and suplexes him so hard he fucking explodes. [Audience cheers, Justin and Travis laugh] Next up are the dolls; there’s like eight of them left.
Justin: We ignore them.
Travis: [laughing] We go on about our business.
Griffin: I’ll tell you what, Merle let’s have a strength contest with disadvantage because it’s eight action figures. It’s a 12... and that’s a 10.
Justin: [low and dramatic] Come on, dad...
Griffin: It’s eight action figures.
Clint: 16.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: These poor action figures, I had such big plans for them. But... it’s eight— It’s eight action fi— you kill— you destroy them, it’s eight action figures. You kick them apart. You kick the eight action figures apart. You’ve done it, do you feel big? You feel big now, hotshot?
[Audience laughs]
Clint: I don’t feel bad.
Griffin: Next in the order is Merle. It’s just Cherub Joe in front of you, he looks a bit concerned.
Justin: Come on dad. Kill him.
Travis: Do it!
Justin: Kill him, kill him, dad.
[Griffin laughs]
Travis: Murder him!
Clint: [through Justin and Travis’s goading] I...
Justin: [crosstalk] Kill this idiot. Kill this besuited baby.
Clint: Cast...
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, do it, do it!
Clint: Banishment!
Griffin: Okay.
[Audience cheers]
Clint: I am going to banish Trader Joe [Griffin: Cherub Joe.] Cherub Joe [audience cheers][crosstalk] to another plane of existence.
Justin: [crosstalk] Send him to hell! Send him to hell!
Clint: I’m sending him to our plane of existence!
Griffin: And he falls in through the fucking ceiling, ""whats up""! Okay yeah, you send him to our plane of existence.
Travis: No! He doesn’t! I— I won’t let him— [unintelligible as Griffin interrupts]
Griffin: No, listen. There’s a crowd. I’m seeing it in my mind because it’s happening in our world. Everybody be silent.
Justin: Shh, close your eyes and imagine.
Griffin: [in a very low, casual tone] It’s 8:15 in the morning. It’s Brooklyn, New York. A crowd of passengers are all standing in front of the train line that they’re taking to work that morning. Suddenly a rift in spacetime opens up and everybody standing there is like, ""oh shit not again"" [Audience cheers] A diapered man falls through the rift.
Clint: Not the first one they’d seen that day.
Griffin: Probably not. Shit’s wild. He collapses as he falls through the rift and stands up and says,
Cherub Joe: Okay what—
Griffin: And is hit by a train and dies.
[Audience cheers, Justin laughs]
Travis: Everyone goes on about their business.
Griffin: You’ve solved the factory puzzle, congratulations.
[Audience cheers]
Travis: Yay!
Griffin: The real Jeff Angel steps forward towards your party, he’s massaging a sore neck— sore because he’s been in a safe, you got that— [Travis: Yeah, yeah.] Surrounding him are the destroyed forms of the dolls sharing his likeness. He kicks around the room a little bit and finds it: the one Turbo Jeff doll, mint condition, that hasn’t been completely destroyed. He bends down, he picks it up, and he says,
Jeff Angel: You know, for unlicensed material this is pretty good stuff. If Cherub Joe wasn’t planning on using these to take over the world or whatever, I might have signed off on it. I heard you’re looking for a Turbo Jeff doll. I guess I could let you all take this one off my— [stops abruptly] Oh, yeah, I guess there’s... just the one doll...
Travis: We take it.
Jeff Angel: Well it’s uh, up to you guys [Travis: We take it.] figure it out amongst yourselves. I got three months of wrestling plot to catch up on.
Griffin: And he sets it on the floor, equally between the three of you and Gerald Loggins.
Travis: We take it. [crosstalk] I don’t know Timothy.
Justin: [crosstalk] No, no, no.
Griffin: [crosstalk] You pick it up and Gerald says,
Gerald: Yeah, uh, I guess we’ve come to the end of the road. It’s been an honor, but it looks like we’re gonna have to fight to— no I’m just kidding.
Taako: Listen, Gerald... [Gerald starts to speak again but they both stop] I—
Clint: Go, Taako.
Taako: Gerald, we don’t even like Angus that much. [Audience protests] And the thing about it is, we— he’s a— he’s a good egg, and I think if we tell him it’s simple misunderstanding where we did our best and came up empty handed, he’s gonna understand. Gerald, it’s Candlenights. I want you to take the doll.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: He is in stunned silence, he does not know what to say, he says,
Gerald: I’m... I’m speechless. I was planning on fashioning Timothy his own Turbo Jeff out of things we’ve got lying around the house [voice starts to crack as if to start crying] but this is gonna make him so much happierrrr.
Magnus: That’s a really good idea, actually.
Griffin: And he—
Taako: Yeah, you know what? Look around guys, pick up some scraps! [Griffin and the audience laugh] What’s better than a Turbo Jeff that we make for Angus!
Griffin: And with that—
Clint: Merle casts Mend and fixes one of the Turbo Jeffs!
[Audience cheers]
Justin: [crosstalk] But it’s like... bad. [laughs] It looks bad.
Travis: [crosstalk] It has like two sets of legs.
Clint: We break Angus’ glasses so he can’t tell—
Griffin: You step forward and hand the mint condition Turbo Jeff over to Gerald Loggins. Then we flash forward back to the party of the Bureau of Balance headquarters. The party has thinned out quite a bit, but Angus is sitting up, alert, looking expectantly for you all to return in anticipation.
Travis: [in response to the crowd] Yeah you were all so happy when we gave it to Gerald huh? Didn’t think about the future.
Griffin: He says,
Angus: Hello sirs. Sorry to have missed you at most of the party, I take it you all had business to attend to planetside.
Griffin: And looks up at you sort of expectantly.
Taako: Candlenights business!
Griffin: He says,
Angus: Yes! Uhh... uhh... how’d it go? [chuckles nervously]
Magnus: Went okay.
Taako: Good, good.
Merle: It was alright.
Taako: Did you hear about the fire at the Jeff Angel toy factory?
[A pause]
Merle: Oh yeah.
[Audience laughs]
Taako: Don’t worry, we got you the last one. From the fire. [Griffin laughs]
Clint: And it’s arm falls off.
Taako: It’s a collectors item. Merle go head, pass it over.
Merle: Look he— if you notice, this is after he’s been in a flame match.
Taako: Some battle damage! Battle Damage Jeff Angel action figure.
Merle: There is only one like this.
Taako: One of a kind!
Magnus: And as you can see it’s signed by Jeff Angle.
[Everybody laughs]
Merle: Here you go, punk’in.
Griffin: He takes it and one of the legs drips off and falls on the table which he looks at contemplatively for a while.
Merle: It’s supposed to do that, it’s like a Transformer!
Justin: Transforms from a toy into trash!
Griffin: He takes it and you see the detective arithmetic appear around his head as he looks at the doll, and then he looks at the three of you, and he sees the crossbow wound in Magnus’ stomach, and the many, many bruises from all the times he fell down the stairs. And he looks at Taako’s burned head and hat— [Merle: Look at my spider bite!] and Merle’s two weeping spider bite wounds on his neck, then back at the toy, then back all of your wounds, and he says,
Angus: [a pause][satisfied] It’s perfect.
[crowd ‘aww’s]
Griffin: Happy Candlenights, everybody! What a touching ending to the story, thank you all so much for coming. Happy Candlenights, we’ll see you next time!
Justin: Be safe!
Griffin: Be safe, goodbye!

Griffin: Hey this is Griffin, real quick, this is going to be the live show that we recorded in Atlanta earlier this month. We were not able to record a new episode— we had a pretty narrow window to do so because Travis was in London for the London Podcast Festival, and then between surgeries and sick babies and stuff, we just— we weren’t able to get together and record, and I’m sorry that we have to go a month between new Amnesty episodes, but we will be back two Thursdays from now with a new episode of Amnesty. So, until then, I hope you enjoy this live Balance episode from Atlanta, Georgia!
[intro music fades in, audience cheers]
Justin: Hey Paul, I meant to tell you I’m gonna be doing a new bit where I throw my umbrella up— way up in the rafters like Prince? And I need somebody to catch it and make it disappear like Prince.
Travis: Also, Paul? Thank you for setting up my area like the interesting person in the office.
Griffin: Yeah. Travis has a lot of flair right now. Could I get, like, 8 times more monitor than I’m currently getting right now?
Justin: That’s an exaggeration, of course. You do work in numbers, so I can see how you could be confused.
Griffin: No, ruin me! Ruin me with your monitor! Pierce me with these sound waves. Hello Atlanta, Georgia. Thank you— [audience cheers] Let’s see… Oh, that is nice, thank you Paul. Hi, Atlanta. Thanks for coming to The Adventure Zone. I know we’re out here, a little bit outside the city, outside of Dra— Everybody’s at DragonCon, right? [audience cheers] Okay.
Justin: That’s a looooot of dragons. Dang, I’m glad you all—
Travis: But it’s the one time a year they get together!
Griffin: Can we get the house lights turned on? And then… Okay, okay, if you are cosplaying, please stand up. Cosplayers? It’s everyone.
Justin: We’re gonna get to a point in—
Griffin: Please, god, turn the house lights off.
Justin: Yeah, it’s so many— so many people.
Travis: They’re too beautiful!
Justin: We’re gonna get to a point in The Adventure Zone where somebody’s going to be wearing like, a nice button-down and some khakis, and people are going to be like, “And who the fuck are you? I don’t get it, I’m sorry. My friends and I have been over there for like 20 minutes trying to figure it out. Who are you?”
And it’s like, “I’m… just Greg?”
“Oh, Tuff Greg?”
“No, not Tuff Greg. I’m just a regular Greg. I’m just Greg.”
Griffin: Do we introduce ourselves on this one? I forget.
Clint: We can.
Justin: My name is Justin McElroy and I portray the role of Taako, an elf. [audience cheers]
Travis: My name is Travis McElroy and I embody Magnus Burnsides. [audience cheers]
Clint: Tonight the role of Merle Highchurch will be played by me, Clint McElroy. [audience cheers]
Griffin: I’m Griffin, and I do everyone else! [audience cheers]
Justin: Okay, um. A quick confession: Travis said “I embody Magnus Burnsides.” I thought he said, “I am Bobby ‘Magnus’ Burnsides.” It’s like, whoa! We waited this long to—
Travis: Yeah. Big reveal!
Justin: Bobby Burnsides is your character?! And Magnus is a nickname! Okay, fine!
Griffin: I also love how Travis has done both shows here in Atlanta with his full arms exposed. [audience cheers]
Travis: Well. I don’t know if you know this, but it is quite hot here!
Griffin: It is a little hot. Speaking of hot things, are you all ready for… adventure? [audience cheers]
Travis: Huh.
Griffin: We are now in the adventure. The three of you are in a fitting room.
Justin: Mkay.
Griffin: You have absolutely no memory of how you got here, you have no memory of the three of you hanging out in a clothing retailer or finding a promising garment that you’d like to audition in a fitting room.
Travis: Wait, ever? We’ve never done this?
Griffin: Not… that would put you in one now. But you are in one now, you’re in a fitting room. It’s lined with several booths covered in floor-to-ceiling privacy curtains. There are benches in between them, a place for weary friends to wait and provide feedback during a fashion montage.
This is where the three of you find yourselves: in a nondescript fitting room with no exits, all alone. What do you do?
Travis: Smash the mirror! [audience laughs]
Griffin: Roll. A— d20.
Travis: 13! Plus 10! 23!
Griffin: Uh, you smash a mirror, and it— behind it, is what appears to be outer space. And it starts to suck you out into the vacuum of space to die, but then the mirror reforms very quickly, magically and mysteriously. And, attracted by the noise, a figure slides open one of the curtains and steps out of the booth. It is an unimposing, inconceivable figure who says,
Garfield: Hello, fellas! [audience cheers] I know it’s been a while, but— I’ve got a deal for you!
Griffin: It is, indeed, Garfield the Deals Warlock.
Justin: Quick interlude. Today I went outside DragonCon for 10 minutes, and I saw a Garfield out there that greeted me warmly. He was offering deals to people that passed by in the line. As this Garfield and I were conversing, another Garfield came up and accused him of stealing his territory. The two of them made peace, and are lifelong friends now, I assume.
Griffin: Garfield says,
Garfield: So, uh, I know we haven’t really talked since you summoned me through a magic portal to throw grenades at an entity of cosmic annihilation— which is fine, we all get busy from time to time! But things haven’t been so great for ol’ Garfield.
[audience ‘aww’s, Griffin laughs which causes the audience to laugh]
Justin: Don’t pity him! He may be the worst thing—
Travis: He built my body out of blood!
Justin: He’s the worst!
Garfield: That turned out super good, if I remember!
Travis: Don’t try to spin a yarn like that was Garfield’s plan all al— [Garfield impression] “I’m building a backup for Magnus, if he should need it!”
Griffin: [Garfield voice] “You got touched by an angel!” And he grows angel wings, and flies off. He says,
Garfield: I’ve tried to reopen the Fantasy Costco in a few promising locations! Got a nice corner lot out in Rockport, and a big space for a superstore in the Felicity Wilds, made a little boutique locale out in the Merchants’ Quarter of Neverwinter. And, yeah, so… All those burned down.
[everyone laughs]
Travis: [still laughing] In the front row, you were so shocked by that! I watched you go, [dramatic gasping noise]. I thought it was great. Thank you for going on this journey with us.
Garfield: Like, all of ’em, pretty soon after I built ’em, burned right down. Whoosh! Now I thought—
Magnus: Have you been smoking?
Garfield: I mean, the normal amount, but I’m always careful with my butts! Now I thought I had a sneaky serial arsonist on my hands, but I set up a whole bunch of Scuttle Buddies in my last store and, no dice. Also thought I was cursed! So I got purified at a local temple! That’s right, your old pal Garfield’s born again! But then my next store burned down, so that wasn’t it.
Fortunately I was able to track down the source of my problem, see— my store isn’t being burned down by some dinkus here in our world, it’s being burned down by fire!
Griffin: He says,
Garfield: Sorry, like— the elemental plane of fire! Someone or somethin’ over there has it out for ol’ Garfield. I was hopin’ you might be able to help me suss out who’s been wrecking my shops and then maybe, you know, help me wreck their shop.
Magnus: What do we get?
Garfield: Hmm!
Griffin: He strokes his— whatever he’s got inside of there.
Travis: He strokes his shadow.
Griffin: He says,
Garfield: I could offer you some shares in the Fantasy Costco.
Taako, Magnus, and Merle: [uncertain noises]
Magnus: You know, at this point we’re pretty famous. I don’t really need money anymore? And magical goods!
Merle: And they’ve all burnt down, right?
Griffin: Magnus, Garfield takes out a slip of paper and writes a number on it, showing you what one share in the Fantasy Costco is worth and hands it to the three of you.
Magnus: [startled, excited noise]
Garfield: I’d be willing to part with 1% of the Fantasy Costco stocks. I’m not sure exactly how the whole thing works.
Magnus: 3%, one for each.
Garfield: Yep, that’s— kind of what I said.
Magnus: Oh.
Garfield: How’s it sound and how’s this deal smellin’, boys?
Magnus: What if we said no?
Garfield: It’d be a short episode!
[audience laughs]
Magnus: Taako, you’re our lead negotiator.
[beat]
Taako: You had me at money.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: He says,
Garfield: Thank goodness!
Griffin: And he turns, and he walks over to one of the curtains in these changing booths. And he takes a deep breath and then throws it open, and suddenly, all the curtains in the room are blown about by a sharp, howling wind that blows in through the booth. Garfield struggles to keep his footing until the wind subsides, at which point he gestures into the booth, and beyond the curtain is the elemental plane of fire.
Travis: Magnus hurries forward. [audience cheers]
Justin: (Got the swords? ?) During the break?
Travis: Magnus makes a speedy exit!
Griffin: It’s pretty warm in there. All of you—
Travis: Magnus rips the sleeve off his shirt.
Griffin: Sure. [audience cheers] As you all step through the curtain, Garfield draws it closed behind you, and suddenly the curtain disappears. And now, you’re just standing on this large hill covered in pebbles of black volcanic rock. And before you is the entrance to a city, a massive, sprawling city with towering buildings, all with a uniform aesthetic. They’re all made out of this shiny polished brass.
There are no walls that surround this town, just a few streams of lava pouring out of this great fire sea behind the city. And this city of brass extends up a slope, almost like an amphitheater, ending at a huge outcropping of rock that hangs over this sea of molten lava below. And on that cliff is a castle, also made out of glistening brass.
Also worth noting: there’s no sky in the plane of fire. There’s just a ceiling of black rock that hangs above you, as far as the eye can see. At certain points, little rivers of lava are pouring down from fissures in the ceiling, and one particularly large crack is positioned right above this brass castle, which is pouring down this thick column of lava down onto the structure itself.
Travis: Did you intentionally design it to look like the Netherworld in Minecraft, or…? [audience cheers]
Griffin: Is that what the Minecraft world looks like? Okay. [chuckling] No, I didn’t. I’m so sorry.
Travis: I’m just savin’ you the tweets!
Griffin: And Garfield points to this castle and he’s like,
Garfield: Pretty badass, right?! Like, metal as all get-out, I thought!
Magnus: I bet it’s hot as fuck!
Garfield: Yeah, maybe a little bit. I’ve never actually been in there, but I know what’s ever torchin’ my shops is inside that castle, so we’re gonna need to find a way in and confront the responsible party. I’ve never really been to the plane of fire, so I don’t know if that party’s gonna be like a big lava monster, [Magnus gasps] or a bunch of dragons, [Magnus gasps] or a fire demon [Magnus: Yes!] or somethin’, but, y’know— stay frosty! [Justin laughs]
Merle: Could you possibly help us out, maybe, with some— fire-retardant… underwear, or something?
Griffin: He says,
Garfield: Let me see what I’ve got!
Griffin: And he reaches into the bag, and he pulls out three frosty-cold bottles of Cheerwine, which he— [audience cheers] cracks open and he hands to each of you, and he says,
Garfield: This isn’t gonna like, protect you from fire damage or anything, but it’s gonna be refreshing as heck.
[audience laughs]
Travis: Magnus slams it and starts runnin’!
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: We’ve only got two hours!
Griffin: You all make your way through the city of brass as you approach the castle at the edge of town—
Travis: Wait, hold on! Are there, like, denizens?
Griffin: There doesn’t seem to be denizens. At least not on the streets. Most of the buildings have had their windows and doors boarded up. A tumbleweed actually rolls down the street towards you, and then bursts into flames. [Clint and Travis laugh]
And as you reach the castle, you see a conflict brewing at its gates. You see two salamanders, these huge, hulking, red, humanoid lizard creatures that are native to the plane of fire. They’re holding spears, and they appear to be escorting what seems to be a large, living fireball away from the castle. One of the guards tries to kick the fireball’s butt as it saunters away, and then recoils ’cause their foot kinda catches fire a little bit.
And the two guards return to their posts and the fireball wanders in your direction, and as he approaches your party, he says,
Fireball: [high-pitched voice] You all headin’ to the castle? Don’t bother, it sucks in there.
Taako: And uh, who might you be?
Fireball: My name is Cinder, nobody’s ever asked me my name before! [delighted giggle] What a great day this is turning out to be!
[audience laughs]
Taako: Consider yourself seen, Cinder. What’s your story?
Griffin: As he starts talking to you, he moans a little bit, and he appears to shrink slightly. And he says,
Cinder: Oh, uh, well, I used to work in the castle. I powered King Scald’s forge, but uh, he decided I wasn’t carrying my weight, so I got— I got shitcanned, and uh—
Clint: [laughing] So he got--
Magnus: In this economy?!
Merle: --You got fired?
[audience cheers]
Travis: I feel like when Dad does one of those, cowbells should start ringing, and like fireworks should go off, like, “Ooh! Somebody just won a thousand dollars!” [audience laughs]
Griffin: He says,
Cinder: Yeah, that’s uh— that’s pretty good. I mean, I’m— I’m probably gonna die. [audience laughs] Out here. On my own.
Griffin: And as he says that, he shrinks a little bit more, as if the fire is fading a little bit.
Travis: I grab some of my scrap wood from the Pocket Workshop [Griffin: Okay.] and feed it to him.
Griffin: Oh, he grows big and strong,
Cinder: Mmm!
Clint: [chuckling] Now you don’t have to do that voice!
Cinder: [deep, gruff voice] Yummy! [audience laughs] So anyway, uh… Yeah, King Scald kicked me to curb and so now I’m, uh— you know, just— I guess I gotta find new employment. Maybe I’ll power an oven or somethin’ like that, but um… Yeah, what are you all doin’ here? You don’t seem like you’re locals.
Magnus: I gue— I think— We have to, maybe… kill King Scald? I dunno, we didn’t ask a lot of questions. [audience laughs] And I wasn’t listening.
Taako: Somebody in this plane has been torching some shops on the other side, and, for a little bit at least, we have to be invested in that problem.
[audience laughs]
Cinder: Oh yeah, that definitely sounds like somethin’ King Scald would do. Uh, I’d say you should seek audience with him, but that’s gonna be tricky, since most folks who try to reach the throne room end up gettin’ their flesh melted off.
Taako: What’s his MO? What’s he after?
Cinder: Well, uh— maybe if you cross my palm with a little bit more tinder, I might be able to uh…?
Taako: Or we could stand here and watch you die! [audience laughs and cheers] I’ve heard the finale, I know how long I have. What about you? [Clint laughs]
Cinder: You drive a hard bargain. [Griffin’s regular voice] Well, see, King Scald actually used to be the court blacksmith—
Griffin: He shrinks a little bit.
Travis: Yeah, I was gonna say.
Justin: He looks exactly like my brother Griffin!
Cinder: King Scald used to be the court blacksmith. He was the brother of our former king, King Wrathfang. But uh—
Magnus: The brother made his— he made his brother blacksmith for ’im?!
Cinder: Well, he blacksmithed for most of the town, most of the royal family. But, one day, King Wrathfang disappeared, and the queen took flight not too long after— we never heard from them again, so now King Scald sits on the throne, and he’s pretty shitty at his job, for real.
Magnus: He shits on the throne?!
Cinder: [high-pitched voice] In a manner of speaking…
Clint: Uh-oh!
Travis: I toss ’im some wood chips.
Justin: Thank you.
Cinder: [deep, gruff voice] Mmm! Yumma yumma!
Travis: Not that many.
Cinder: [Griffin’s regular voice] Yumma yumma! [Clint and audience laugh] So yeah, he keeps us elementals locked up to power his forge and spends all the town’s resources just crankin’ out metalwork, day in, day out, so uh… [enunciating] Not a good king, if I do say so m’self! [beat] Anyway!
Magnus: Alright, well we’re gonna go kill ’im, I guess!
Cinder: That would be cool… I’m gonna go find some trees or whatever.
Magnus: [laughing] Okay, bye!
Taako: Wait, does he have any cool weaknesses?
Cinder: King Scald?
Taako: Yup!
Cinder: I mean, this really seems like a transactional thing, right? Maybe a little—
Travis: I throw some more wood chips.
Cinder: [deep, gruff voice] Mmm, yeah!
Travis: More than that!
Cinder: [louder, even deeper voice] Ohhh, yeah! [Travis laughs] No known weaknesses, baby!
Travis: I throw some water on ’im!
Cinder: [high-pitched voice] Ahhh!
Travis: Less than that.
Cinder: [softer] Ahhh… [Justin and Clint laugh] I mean… I mean, hubris, but isn’t that— just, all of us?
Taako: Yeah, it’s all of us. Who hasn’t been there?
Cinder: [beat] See ya later!
Taako: Yeah!
Griffin: And he floats away towards town. And watching this whole exchange are these two salamander guards.
Travis: [impersonating the guards] “That’s fucked up!”
Griffin: And as they see you approach the gate, one of them, a bit larger and more imposing than his companion, speaks and says,
Larger Guard: [tersely, in a deep, amphibian-like voice] No.
Magnus: Uh…
Larger Guard: N— no.
Magnus: Hi, friend! I assume that, maybe, a higher force has planned a whole encounter here, but I’m just gonna say, search your memory for, uh, maybe a year or two back: a song entered your head with a bunch of stuff that like, three people did? [audience cheers] You really wanna fuck with us?
[beat]
Larger Guard: [tersely] No.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: And the smaller guard— I did not think about the fact that you can play that card, [Travis: Yeah!] pretty much whenever the fuck! The smaller guard says,
Smaller Guard: Aw man, but we’re really not supposed to let anyone in…!
Taako: You gotta love the dedication. I do respect it, though, I do respect the dedication.
Merle: Yeah.
Taako: It’s just—
Magnus: Maybe we could cast like a glamor on you, to make you look real beat up?
Smaller Guard: That might be— that might be nice, um—
Justin: What is this guard again? It’s a salamander?
Griffin: Yeah, it’s like a big red lizard-folk.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Why d’you ask? You got some—
Justin: No! Just, wanna create a mental picture for myself. Wanna take everybody on this journey with me who may not have been paying very close attention.
Griffin: The smaller guard says,
Smaller Guard: You know what? This gig sucks anyway, and, you all seem like you’re pretty um, high-level dudes, so… Um, yeah, I guess you can pass. There’s definitely gonna be some obstacles in your way that you won’t be able to sort of brag your way through… [laughter] I wish there was somethin’ I could help you out with ’cause seriously, King Scald just huffs nuts, man. He’s— [laughter]
Magnus: [snorts, laughs, and claps his hands together] Man, some things extend across all planes, huh?
Smaller Guard: [beat] Well, see ya later!
Griffin: And the two gua--
Magnus: Okay, bye!
[laughter]
Justin: I di— Wait, you could’ve made him roll a die, at least, to see if that worked. Did you just decide in your head? That’s not Dungeons and Dragons! That’s Dungeons and Griffin!
Griffin: Why don’t you— Then one of them says,
Guard: But wait a minute…
Justin: There it is!
Clint: Here we go!
Griffin: Why don’t you roll a persuasion check?
Justin: Master of persuasion.
Griffin: It’s a d20.
Travis: That’s an eight.
Griffin: [skeptical] Is that the 20-sided dice?
Travis: [regretfully] Yeah. Plus a one. So nine.
Guard: Man, I don’t know…
Travis: Now, hold on! Hold on, hold on. That would’ve been intimidation. Right? ’Cause it’s like, you wanna fuck with us.
Griffin: Oh yeah, sure, sure.
Travis: Alright. So it’s actually a 14.
Griffin: Oh. Yeah, that does—
Guard: O-kay. All the stuff I said before… is canon. So. [laughter]
Clint: So can we— can we kill ’em anyway?
Travis: Dad! Yes!
Griffin: I mean they’re standing--
Travis: I attack them. [audience “Oh!”s]
Justin: No you don’t! No you don’t. No you don’t.
Travis: I don’t.
Justin: He doesn’t.
Clint: Damn!
Griffin: They’re standing on bridge over a—
Travis: I push ’em!
Griffin: — a moat of lava…!
Travis: I push ’em, but then I kinda catch ’em back, I’m like,
Magnus: Ahaha!
[audience laughs]
Taako: [in a Batman impression] Tell your friends!
Magnus: [also in a Batman impression] Swear to me!
Taako: “You know the difference between you and me?—
Magnus: No.
Taako: — It’s actually a— a long list, hold on. [Griffin, Clint and Justin chuckle] I’m an elf and you’re kind of a lizard person. I live in the—
Magnus: [holding back laughter] There’s more that unites us than divides us!
Taako: There’s a lot, actually, but we still both love the smell of baking bread, eh? Anyway.
Magnus: Let’s hug.
Taako: Let’s hug. For life. [laughter] And I’m not wearing hockey paaants!
Clint: And then you push ’em off.
Travis: No!
Griffin: They just— they’ve already walked away. They left a while ago.
Justin: [laughing] They just left us to do our Batman impressions.
Griffin: [amused] Yes.
Travis: [laughing] As Taako and Magnus do Batman impressions back and forth!
Justin: Listen to this one. [exaggerated Batman impression] “Where’s Falcone?”
[laughter]
Griffin: So, even with your Cheerwine protection from the sort of ambient heat of this place, you feel this oppressive wave of heat coming from in front of you, because across the bridge through the gate that you are currently in front of, is— the entrance to the castle. It is covered completely by a waterfall of lava. This column of lava that’s falling from the rock ceiling of the plane is splashing against the roof and just falling down, just forming this solid wall, this nonstop cascade of lava, that pours down through this black obsidian grate at the far end of the bridge, cutting off access into the castle. There doesn’t seem to be any way past it. What do you do?
Travis: Well, I should’ve done this before, but I switch the Defender’s Dial to fire.
Griffin: Yeah, I figured.
Travis: Click!
Justin: So there’s a grate?
Griffin: Uh, yep. And the lava is pouring down into it. Through it, and sort of down into this moat of lava below the bridge.
Justin: I dunno. There’s nothing really to do, it’s fire, it’s lava, it’s so hot? It’s crazy, how hot it is! [scattered laughter] Tr— touch it, just—
Travis: No! [then almost immediately] Okay.
Justin: Umm…
Clint: Wait! [makes tutting noises] Neh, neh, neh, neh...
Travis: Well, let Dad fuck up!
Justin: [apathetic] Yeah.
[audience cheers, someone rings a bell]
Travis: Who does have a bell that they’re ringing? I love it! I conjured it into existence!
Clint: Merle… Is… Casts…
Justin: Mhmmm?!
Travis: [muffled] I saw the card!
Clint: Control Weather!
[audience laughs, the bell rings again]
Travis: That’s not what it says.
Clint: And makes it snow—
Travis: That is not what it says.
Clint: — on the lava.
Travis: That is not what it says. Can you read the card again?
Clint: I can read the card again.
Travis: And it says…
Clint: It’s right there.
Griffin: Travis? [beat] Okay.
[scattered laughter]
Justin: Why did you think that was going to fly?
Clint: ’Cause I’ve done it before!
Travis: Lied?! [audience laughs] You’ve bullshat?!
Clint: I have! I have bullshat before!
Griffin: Alright. Who has— Wizards of the Coast worked really hard on this game. Creating all sorts of spells and stunts and abilities—
Travis: Magnus casts Ice.
Justin: [laughs] A spell! Uh, I will cast Ice Storm, a fourth-level invocation spell.
Griffin: Alright.
Clint: Wh— But—
Justin: A hail of rock-hard ice pounds— [everyone bursts into laughter] It fuckin’ says it! A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground— [everyone laughs] Why is this spell description a fucking Chuck Tingle story?! A hail of rock— [Southern accent] a hail of rock-hard ice pounds into the ground, with all its buds, [Griffin starts singing ‘bow chicka wow-wow’] in a 20-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on any point within range of the grate.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Each creature— And then it’s like, etc., etc., but, it takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage. It’s more of an attack, but, you get what I’m goin’ for.
Griffin: Sure, sure. I don’t necessarily know what you’re going f— I get, you’re using ice on the grate and the lava, but what’re you thinking this’ll do?
Travis: Obviously, Griffin, that the ice would form, and then it would harden into onyx, as the— or no, what’s the word, obsidia— no— What am I looking for?
[audience members yell out “obsidian”]
Clint: Rocks.
Travis: Obsidian.
Griffin: Okay. I was just tryin’a—
Travis: And create an archway that we can walk through!
Griffin: Uh, it doesn’t create an archway. It does create a solid sort of panel of obsidian now immediately in front of you—
Travis: That’s not how that would work.
Griffin: — But the lava is now kind of cascading off of—
Justin: Okay, then I, uh—
Travis: Then I smash through it!
Griffin: Okay. Roll an attack roll. It’s obsidian, which is— pretty hard, yes?
[audience yells out ‘yeah’]
Griffin: Yes. Quite hard.
Travis: Uh, it’s a 14?
Griffin: A 14? Uh, no! Take 16 points of damage, you’re just punching fucking obsidian! Merle?
Clint: I actually have something!
Griffin: Merle has the floor!
Clint: He has a spell called Shape Stone.
Griffin: Oh good!
[audience cheers, someone rings a bell]
Clint: It can make a 5-foot hole!
Griffin: Good!
Clint: In the panel!
Griffin: Yes!
Clint: Right?!
Griffin: Yes!
[audience cheers]
Clint: What do I roll?
Griffin: [amused] Nothing, I think you just do it.
Clint: [yells] Yeah! [Griffin laughs] I do it! Right through the rock-hard stuff!
Griffin: You form a door in the obsidian panel, and create a doorway for all of you to pass through into the castle. You have solved my lava puzzle.
[audience cheers]
Travis: And… ? What do we do now?
Griffin: Alright. You pass through the archway you created, and then through these large iron double doors that give way as you press against them, which opens up into a large, empty entrance hall.
Travis: I open the door for Taako and Merle.
Griffin: Aww!
Travis: I just wanted to establish that someone opened the door.
Griffin: Alright.
Clint: That I made.
Travis: No. A different door, that Griffin made, with his words.
Clint: [crestfallen] Oh.
Justin: A Griffin-door, if you will!
Griffin: Ha-ha-hey! [audience cheers]
Clint: Do we go Slytherin through the Griffin-door? [audience cheers, Travis laughs]
Travis: [amused] Y’all rock hard.
Griffin: This is a easy episode for me. [they laugh] You pass through some double doors into a large entrance hall—
Travis: Is it a family double door? [Clint laughs]
Griffin: There are massive pillars boasting decorate weapons and armor that are lining both sides of a dazzling red carpet that extends forward to a staircase, which, along with the walkway that it led up to, has collapsed in on itself. [audience cheers] Thank you, Paul.
Most of this room, actually, is in a state of disarray. There are unlit sconces everywhere. The only source of light is radiating from these trickles of lava dripping down the walls from cracks in the ceiling. The only exit from this room is on the far wall, to the left of this ruined staircase.
There’s a large stone door with a frame etched in eldritch runes, which are the most [chuckling] magical runes that there are. In the center of this door, built right into the rock, is a small metal padlock with a keyhole on its face. This is a puzzle, so please pay attention.
Travis: I punch it.
Griffin: Fuck, man, that was it. [Justin laughs] There were so many other things, but the only thing you had to do was punch it! And your fist went in the keyhole, you turned it a little bit…
Clint: I think that was sarcasm, Trav.
Justin: Alright, establish all the beats so far. I’m dialed in now.
Griffin: Okay. To the left of the door are a few eye-catching objects. The first is a pile of metal ingots, arranged in a pyramid right to the side of the door. Placed neatly on top of the pile is a single piece of white chalk. Also, a few feet from the pile of ingots is a relief built into the wall. It depicts a large, burly salamander. It looks like you guys are taking a fuckin’ SAT prep-- [audience laughs] class over there.
Justin: You have never asked us to do a puzzle. [Griffin laughs] In a live venue.
Griffin: One of this salamander’s arms is jutting out of the relief, curled upwards, its fist clenched around a large hammer. This figure is standing above a large anvil that stands immediately below the relief, right above the arm holding the hammer, as if it could come down to strike it. Also, this salamander’s mouth is open in a wide ‘O’ shape, as if caught in the middle jovial laughter…
[beat]
Travis: [amused] I take the chalk and draw a penis next to it.
Griffin: Okay, nothing happens.
Travis: Dammit!
Griffin: There is a metallic plaque in the shape of a banner that hangs over this relief, giving the subject depicted a name: Scald. What do you do?
Justin: Take the hammer. I take the hammer.
Griffin: The hammer is built into the relief. You cannot take it.
Travis: I put one of the ingots between the hammer and the anvil.
Griffin: Nothing happens.
Travis: I leave it there and say,
Magnus: Come on…!
Justin: Now wait— now wait! You had your dumb one, now Dad, what’s your thing?
Clint: I pull Nitpicker out of my bag!
Griffin: Okay. [audience cheers]
Nitpicker: Wow, uh… Couldn’t even get past the first act, huh? Pulled me out a little bit early, don’t’cha think, there, Merle?
Merle: [chuckling] Well, obviously we don’t have any good ideas.
Nitpicker: Well didn’t this guy go to fuckin’ thief school?! Why do you even need me anymore?
Magnus: Oh yeah…!
[audience laughs]
Travis: [sheepishly] Can I try the lock first?
Griffin: Sure.
[pause]
Travis: It’s a 20. [audience cheers]
Griffin: [impressed] Whoa...
Clint: [discouraged] I put Nitpicker back in the bag.
Travis: It’s a nat 20.
Justin: [crosstalk] Can we not, maybe— can we just do the puzzle, though?
Griffin: With a nat 20, the eldritch runes light up as you stick your thieves’ tools into the padlock, and attempt to electrocute you extremely badly, but with a nat 20, you pull back real, real fast. [Justin chuckles] And they do not. The door remains locked.
Magnus: It’s a trap!
Griffin: There are so many things you could do to solve a puzzle with all the beautiful skills that Gary Gygax gave to you, [Travis (?) laughs] my beautiful family.
Clint: Do the ingots move? Can we move them?
Griffin: You can pick ’em up, yeah.
Travis: I’m gonna roll an Investigation check.
Griffin: ’Kay.
Travis: Fifteen?
Griffin: With a 15, you find a few traces of chalk, just a few l’il grains of chalk on the surface of the anvil, just kinda off to the edge.
Travis: Put the chalk on the anvil?
Griffin: You place the chalk on the anvil. Nothin’ happens!
Justin: I’m gonna roll— this may be the same bit of flavor text, but I’m gonna roll a Perception check, uhm… that… is gonna be a 13. I’m basically looking for like, things that look like they’re used regularly to access this pathway.
Griffin: All of it. The ingots, the chalk, the anvil, all of it.
Justin: So it’s all part of it?
Griffin: It’s all kind of part of the puzzle.
Justin: The ingots and the chalk are… part of it.
Griffin: Yes. Merle? Wait, what are you rollin’, pal?
Clint: A Perception check, like everybody else!
Griffin: [loudly] Okay, there is nothing left to perceive! You have perceived everything in the puzzle!
[audience laughs]
Travis: Do Insight. Do Insight.
Clint: An Insight check, then!
Griffin: To see if—
Travis: To see if you, Griffin, are lying.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Okay, insight! I rolled a— an eight? Plus 12. Twenty!
Justin: No.
Travis: What’s up!
Justin: No. No, there is no fuckin’—
Travis: He is very insightful.
Clint: Here, look!
Travis: It says it, on his lying sheet right there!
Griffin: With a 12 Insight—
Travis & Clint: No, it’s 20.
Griffin: A 20 Insight, you insightfully—
Travis: — know that Griffin is hiding—
Griffin: — [slowly] see some scrape… marks on the corner— on the edges of the big, circular, open mouth, as if something has scraped against it.
Travis: [softly] I put an ingot... in the mouth.
Griffin: You put an ingot in the mouth and hear a clunking noise as it slides down into the belly of this thing, and its eyes light up red and some smoke pours out of its mouth as something inside of it activates.
Clint: And we all turn into Tom Hanks!
Travis: Exactly what happened in Big!
Griffin: That’s what happens in Big, some dude goes up to a fortune teller and is like— [crosstalk with Travis] “Oh, my life’s not goin’ so great,” and then he turns into a Tom Hanks.
Justin: [laughing] He puts an ingot in the mouth of a—
Griffin: The mouth of Zolta— Zolt— whatever.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: That’s it! That’s all that happens that time.
Justin: Is there clearly— Okay. Is there anything on the statue that looks like it, uh, it like, moves? Hinges… like—
Griffin: There is a hinge on the elbow. The arm sticking out holding the hammer.
Travis: I take the chalk and write “open” on the anvil.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And then I put another ingot in.
Griffin: Before you even have time to put another ingot in, you write “open” on the anvil, and you see some molten metal actually lift up from the surface of the anvil, from inside of it, and fill in the word that you have written. And then the hammer comes striking down on it, and then you have, just presented in front of you, O-P-E-N in metal, waiting for you on the anvil. Nothing else happens, though.
Justin: Okay, uh, I am going to take out… my Mockingbird Gum.
Griffin: [warily] Okay…
Justin: And I’m going to chew it up.
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: Then. I’m going to chew all of it up.
Griffin: Okay!
Justin: And then I’m going to put it into the keyhole. And then I’m gonna… transmute it… Yeah, I can just transmute the substance. So I’m gonna use my Transmutation Stone to transmute it into…
Griffin: I’m just watching, it’s like the meme with like, all the math moving around the woman’s head.
Justin: Okay. And then I’m gonna transmute it into wood.
Griffin: Okay!
Justin: ’Cause I have the Transmutation Stone. I’m gonna transmute it into wood. And then I’ll pull it back out.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: What’s it look like?
Griffin: [flatly] A key.
Justin: No I mean— I’m gonna trace that exact key with the chalk.
Griffin: Okay! [audience cheers]
Travis: [sings most of a victory theme, but Griffin interrupts the last few notes]
Griffin: You trace that key with the chalk, and it’s sitting there, but the thing is not acting on it.
Travis: I put another ingot in it.
Griffin: [amused] Okay, yeah, metal rises up from the anvil and fills in the tracing of the key. The hammer comes down and strikes it, and now you’ve got yourselves a key goin’. [audience cheers]
Justin: And then I throw that key! Away!
Travis: No! Wait! Taako— ! [Griffin laughs]
Justin: And I say,
Taako: Now you two do one also, ’cause you can’t ride on my coattails!
Justin: Uh, I just fuckin’ bury the key. Into the hole. [Clint laughs]
Travis: Rock hard!
Justin: Rock-hard key!
Griffin: As you do that, you don’t even need to turn it. The padlock falls away and a split opens in the middle of the door, and it slides open. That was a good— [audience cheers] As you go to leave through this room, you notice a few things among the debris in this sort of ruined entryway. They look like discarded weapons and pieces of armor lying amidst the rubble.
And as you sort of turn to leave, it looks like they kind of move with a mind of their own. They scoot a little bit closer and closer to your party, slowly, and then they stop right at Magnus’s feet. And then they kinda like, hang there for a second? And then they fall back down to the ground motionless.
Magnus: Y’all wanna come with, or…?
Griffin: Garfield says,
Garfield: That was pretty weird!
Magnus: I put ’em on?
Griffin: Uh, I mean, you can, if you want. But they appear to just be... kinda shitty pieces of armor. Not any better than the pieces of armor you’ve got now.
Travis: Yeah, but they moved…
Griffin: They’re not moving anymore.
Travis: And you made a point to mention it.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, you can put ’em on.
Magnus: Could uhh one of you magicaaaal dudes, like, check those out?
Justin: Okay. I’ll do an Arcana check. That is a… six plus one.
Taako: I know nothing about these! [Justin laughs and then the audience laughs]
Magnus: Merle? [pause] Roll a d20?
Travis: Magnus said that in-character.
Clint: I do an Arcana check.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Ten. Plus… what?
Travis: Nothing. You have, somehow, no Arcana.
Clint: [crosstalk] No! No— oh, no.
Griffin: Uh, I’m gonna say, both of you, and Taako, I think you get a little bump, just because it’s kinda home turf, there’s transmutation magic— hella transmutation magic comin’ off these things. They have been transmutated. And… yes. You know that much.
Travis: I put them on.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I take his old armor!
Travis: No, I transfer it to the Pocket Workshop, I’m not leaving it behind.
Griffin: You’re wearing, now, platemail armor. It’s not necessarily your aesthetic—
Travis: [stage whisper] Why did it— Hey. Ignore them.
Griffin: [stage whisper] Okay.
Travis: [stage whisper] Why did it move? [Griffin and audience laugh]
Griffin: [pointedly] The door from the entrance hall—
Travis: No, no, no, no, Griffin. We’re brothers.
Griffin: — opens up—
Travis: We’re kin.
Griffin: — to the throne room.
Travis: My flesh, my blood!
Griffin: You are standing in a large rectangular room.
Travis: I thought I knew you.
Griffin: [amused] Yes. [audience laughs] Look at the clock… Oh, no!
You have reached the throne room of the castle. It’s a large, rectangular room. About halfway in from your position are these two large, thick columns of lava falling in through cut holes in the ceiling down into grate-covered holes in the floor. There is no far wall to this room. There is just simply a half-dozen or so pillars that— I don’t know why I said “or so.” It’s six. Like, I—
Travis: [amused] Six-ish. Give or take.
Justin: Seven, five… [chuckling] Who knows.
Griffin: There are exactly six—
Justin: You’re not gonna sit there and count ’em like an asshole.
Griffin: There are six pillars—
Travis: Who has the time?!
Griffin: There are six pillars that run from the floor to the ceiling, beyond which you can just see, open, the Great Fire Sea, which boils just below the precipice that this castle stands on. It’s just a sheer drop-off, if you went through these pillars. The room is filled with suits of armor, that are flanking you on both sides—
Travis: Do they move?
Griffin: They are not. They are carrying various weapons. They’re arranged in rows to your left and right, just this army of armor that fills a majority of the room, silently watching the royal proceedings. And, at the end of this room is a dais, and a stone throne, upon which sits the only other person in this room: a big, burly salamander who, you recognize from the relief outside, is King Scald.
Travis: Is he laughing?
Griffin: [amused] Yeah, sure.
Travis: That’s how we— First we’re looking at ’im, “Mmm...”, and then he laughed and we’re like, “Ohh!”
Clint: [impression of Scald laughing]
Griffin: He says,
Scald: [deep, gruff voice] Okay. Let me—
Travis: [Bowser impression] “I’m gonna marry Princess Peach!” [audience laughs and cheers]
Griffin: He says,
Scald: It’s been a long time since I had visitors! Where are you from, little ones?
Magnus: Wh— uh—
Taako: I’m from TV.
[audience cheers]
Magnus: R-uhh—
Taako: Do you get that here, Cro-Magnon? TV?
Scald: Okay… Didn’t need to get like this this fast. [Justin laughs]
Magnus: I’m from, originally, a planet with, I think, two moons? I don’t know, that was a long time ago. And then Raven’s Roost… So I guess I would say I’m from Raven’s Roost, really?
Scald: Are you the guys from the song?
Magnus: [enthusiastically] Yeah!
Taako: That’s us.
Scald: [crosstalk] O-kay, cool. That’s gonna cut a lotta exposition out.
Merle: The beach.
Magnus: Do you want us to sign anything?
Scald: That’s okay. Is there anything I can do for you? What are ya doin’ in my realm?
Taako: Have you been burning down Garfield’s stores?
Griffin: Garfield kind of waves nervously as you say that, and Scald says,
Scald: Yeah, that’s me. [audience laughs] So, you’re the merchant, huh? I’ve been deeply curious about you, I admit. According to my scouts, you were in possession of something that belongs to me. They made a terrible mess of your business ventures, right?
[audience makes noises of anticipation]
Griffin: Says,
Scald: I apologize, ’cause it appears this item has changed hands.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: King Scald looks at Magnus and says,
Scald: The sword, please.
[audience cheers]
Magnus: Uh, this is ironic, considering where we are, but— over my cold, dead body.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Scald says,
Scald: Uhh, I feel like you maybe don’t understand the… the true power of this sword. See, for decades, I served as the loyal smithy to this realm.
Magnus: Mhm.
Scald: My creations were unparalleled in quality, and yet my services were never truly appreciated—
Magnus: [crosstalk] Cool.
Scald: — by the royal family. Are you listenin’, or— ?
Magnus: Yeah.
[audience laughs]
Scald: So—
Magnus: Uh-huh?
[audience laughs]
Scald: So I found the means to make them respect my work. I would make them… become my work.
Griffin: And then he gestures upwards, and there are swords and spears and axes hanging all around the room, each of which features a name plate. There’s “Queen Ashspine”, “Duke Incindius”, and so on. And he says,
Scald: I do not know how the highlight of my collection was stolen from me or how it ended up in your hands, Fighter.
Griffin: And he motions to a plaque hanging—
Magnus: Fuck you! My name’s Magnus!
Griffin: He motions to a plaque on the wall, hanging above the throne. It’s a long plaque with two hooks turned upward which held, once, a great, wicked sword. And underneath, there’s a name plate that reads, “King Wrathfang.” And Scald says,
Scald: Well, uh, never mind all that. This is a cause for celebration!
Griffin: And he taps his hammer against the armrest of the throne, and the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom is pulled from your hands into his free hand. [audience cheers] And he looks at the sword, and says,
Scald: Our king has returned!
Griffin: We’re gonna take an intermission right now! [audience cheers] We’ll be right back with Act Two!
[commercial break: 46:10-50:38]
Griffin: How was the initiative roll for everybody?
Travis: I got a 21.
Griffin: Jesus.
Justin: Sixteen.
Clint: Twenty.
Justin: The Hangback Kid.
Griffin: Wow, Jesus.
Clint: Oh, wait! I roll twice.
Griffin: This is true!
Justin: You remember that.
Clint: We’ll stay with the 20. [audience laughs]
Griffin: Okay. First in the order is Magnus, with a 21. You, uh— [audience “ooh”s]
Travis: It’s hot in here!
Griffin: What the fuck just ha— ? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, I guess there’s columns of lava in this room and an open wall looking out into the Great Fire Sea— it would be, kinda red in there. Uh, you see Scald tap his hammer on the throne one more time. He’s already holding the— your sword, well, technically Taako’s sword, in his other hand, and his hammer—
Travis: Well, when you give a gift to a friend, Griffin!
Griffin: Sure. As he taps it a second time, though, a few of the suits of armor flanking you on either side of the room come to life and start marching toward you. Magnus, it’s your turn with a 21!
Travis: Let me finish this text.
Griffin: [miffed] Really, dawg.
Travis: No. [amused] I’m looking up what Disarming Strike does. [audience cheers] “D… and… D”. [audience laughs] Mhm… I’ll roll for the attack first.
Griffin: Okay!
Travis and Justin: [gravely, in unison] Mm. [audience laughs]
Travis: I’m gonna call that interference on the bag.
Griffin and Clint: [in unison] No!
Travis: Okay. It’s a 12, so I miss with that, but then I attack five more times. [audience laughs] So that’s a 19?
Griffin: A 19 is a hit.
Travis: Okay. And then I’m gonna roll… Okay, who here knows how Disarming Strike works?
Griffin: Okay, hold on, this is not going to be good audio. [sing-song] Let’s open up the Player’s Handbook, didn’t think I would have to open it during the show. But that’s okay! Sometimes you gotta read a book on stage.
Justin: [laughs] This is what y’all crave, right, Reddit? [audience cheers] So cool of Reddit to be here tonight. [laughter]
Griffin: “You add your Superiority Dice to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw”— What are you attacking with, by the way?
Travis: [with pep] Chance Lance!
Griffin: Chance Lance, okay. So that’s a d10, for damage.
Travis: Uh, eight?
Griffin: Okay. 22, is what I have to beat. Great. [pause] No. I didn’t do it. What do you— which— he’s got two things, what are you tryin’a make him drop?
[beat]
Travis: My sword!
Griffin: Okay. The Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom drops to the ground. [audience cheers]
Travis: I catch it, before it hits the ground.
Griffin: Technically, it says it lands at its feet, in the Disarming Strike.
Travis: Then I get it, like “hah!”, at the feet.
Griffin: Okay. You get your sword back.
Travis: And I stab ’em… into the ribs!
Justin: That seems like two actions to me.
Travis: Okay!
Griffin: Next in the order is… Merle.
Clint: First, I’d just like to point out, that, Merle does have Control Weather.
Griffin: Okay, but you didn’t fuckin’ have the card out! Thank you, Clint. What is your action?
Clint: Uhm. I’m gonna do somethin’ real cleric-y.
Griffin: Cool.
Clint: And cast, uh… Guardian of Faith! [audience cheers]
Griffin: Excellent. Where does Della Reese appear? I would say sort of the two zones in this fight right now are sort of where the armor is sort of approaching you from the sides of the room, or where King Scald is, sort close to the back of the room.
Clint: Towards the suits of armor.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Yeah. So, I cast that, and the amazing… angelic… Della Reese appears. [audience cheers]
Griffin: Yes. What uh- Can you read me some of that flavor? ’Cause I know they have to make saving throws.
Clint: Oh yeah. Yeah. Um, [mumbles as if fast-forwarding] “any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.”
Griffin: Okay. These armor things act as a swarm, so I’m going to roll one Dex save for all of them. That is a 15, which I believe your spell save is a 20— I looked at all your numbers backstage, [chuckling] so that we didn’t waste any time— uh, they do not save. So what happens?
Clint: The creature takes 20 Radiant damage!
Griffin: Wow. [audience cheers]
Travis: And?
Clint: What else do you want? No, that’s it! Yeah. It was a failed save, correct?
Griffin: Okay, yeah. They take 20 Radiant damage.
Clint: [crosstalk] 20 Radiant damage! Have you guys never played this game before?!
Griffin: Uh there were s— [crosstalk] Oh, Jesus Christ. Uh, there were six suits of armor approaching you, three from the left, three from sort of the right flank, and as they enter into Della Reese’s attack zone, she takes down three of them. Three remain, marching towards you. [audience cheers] Next in the order is… the living armor! The three remaining, moving, living armor pieces, the ones that have not sort of clattered to the ground, approach Merle and seek vengeance. They attack you as a swarm… That is, a 21 versus AC.
Travis: It’s a disadvantage ’cause I’m standing right there and I’m a Defender.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: [enunciating] I’m a protection fighter!
Griffin: Uh, 19 versus AC.
Travis: It does tie.
Clint: Nineteen.
Griffin: Tie goes to the attacker, unfortunately.
Travis: [tsks] Hey, sorry ’bout that.
Griffin: Uh, they cut’cha up good with their axes and swords… for… Yowza! Twenty-two points of Slashing damage. [audience “ooh”s]
Travis: He’s fine!
Merle: [moans in pain dramatically]
Travis: Yep. [audience laughs]
Merle: [continues to whine dramatically]
Griffin: [over Merle] And with that, more— with that more suits of living armor come alive. Five more suits of living armor from the sides of the room start marching towards you. Next in the order is Taako!
Justin: [glumly] That’s so many living suits of armor, though…
Griffin: Yeah. There’s so many in this room.
Justin: How big are they?
Griffin: They’re… suit-of-armor-sized…
Travis: Somewhere between four and a half and six and a half feet. [audience members cheers]
Griffin: Yeah. In that range. There are six, there’s—
[audience laughs]
Travis: [amused] Somebody really liked that joke and I did too! Thank you for coming with me on that!
Justin: Um…
Griffin: Waitin’ on that new Taako EP to drop. [Justin laughs] He dropped some tracks on SoundCloud, it was… [affirming] it was fire.
Travis: Did it slap?
Griffin: It was, the slap. [Justin and audience laugh]
Travis: It was just Justin, line for line, recounting the TV show The Slap.
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Uhh…
Travis: Still need more time?
Griffin: He likes to keep us in anticipation for his new albums? But then he does like a surprise drop, like you weren’t even expecting him to take a turn?
Justin: Well, they’re not really attacking with fire, are they?
Griffin: No.
Justin: ’Cause that was kinda my thing, that I was thinking about.
Griffin: Cool.
Justin: That was… um… I was thinking about how, it would be cool, to do like a fire— [laughs] A fire thing. And now it’s less— I don’t— um…
Travis: This is everyone’s favorite part of a DnD podcast, um—
Griffin: “The wizard looks at his thousand spells.”
Justin: It’s not a thousand spells! I was looking at one spell, and it doesn’t make any sense to Investiture of Flame myself if they’re not attacking with flame! Just— I had that one kinda ready, like excited, but it doesn’t seem like it makes any sense here!
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: I am going to cast… boring old, stupid… [snorts, then a pause] Eugh… [audience laughs] Just a dumbass—
Travis: He doesn’t have it picked yet.
Justin: [annoyed] Just a dumb spell! Just a stupid-ass, like—
Griffin: Do you wanna delay your turn?
Justin: I’m gonna delay my turn, because I have a plan.
Griffin: Alright. [audience cheers] Keep lookin’! Next in the order is Garfield the Deals Warlock. [audience cheers]
Griffin: Garfield kneels down and reaches into his gigantic Bag of Holding, and he roots around in there for a while, and he says,
Garfield: A-ha!
Griffin: And he pulls out a Super Soaker. [audience cheers] And he turns and faces Scald, and shoots him with what appears to be some sort of black ooze that sizzles as it hits Scald, and some of Scald's, sort of... thick leather armor falls away, reducing his AC permanently [scattered cheers] with the black ooze shot at Scald. Uhh... Taako, are you—
Justin: [confident] Yes, I'm ready. How close are all the... uh, bad folks... to Scald? Give me, like, a quick layout.
Griffin: Sure, I would say you're all within, like, 20 feet of each other, in sort of the far end of the room now.
Justin: But we're all in like a 20-foot—
Griffin: Yeuup.
Justin: Uhhh... What would a 20-foot radius from Scald encompass?
Griffin: Um... You guys and the armor. That is, the armor that is currently approaching you to attack. Eight suits of armor, you three, and Scald. [Justin: Mmm—] You four, including Garfield. You know it's gonna be worth it. Unless you need to delay again.
Justin: No, I think we can handle it. [audience laughs] I'm gonna cast Vitriolic Sphere at Scald. [amused] It— I'm pointing at a place within range, and a glowing one-foot ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot radius [audience laughs and cheers]. Each creature has to make a dexterity saving throw. Mine's dope, so I'm fine. [audience laughs]
Travis: A what saving throw?
Justin: That's a dexterity saving throoooow.
Griffin: Scald got a four.
Travis: Twenty!
Griffin: Whoa! [audience cheers]
Travis: Eighteen plus two. Not a nat.
Griffin: The eight suits of living armor got a 13.
Justin: Uhhh... how're you doing, Dad? What's up?
Clint: Mmhmm. Uh.. Se--seven. [audience laughs]
Justin: So, okay.
Griffin: Taako, did you roll it?
Justin: What?
Griffin: Your dexterity saving throw.
Justin: Oh, [chuckling] I'm good. I had a 19. I'm fine against myself.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: I saved against myself. Umm... So, good news, good news, good news on the armor. They're dead. Bad news for you, but that feels like, I dunno, you would kind of think... it's a fair price to pay. [audience laughing]
Travis: [sarcastic] What a great deal!
Justin: I can tell--
Griffin: Two out of three ain't bad!
Travis: Two out of three ain't bad!
Griffin: How much damage are you doing?
Justin: Three out of four! [crosstalk] If you think about it.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Three out of four! Oh yeah, how's Garfield doing? ...Garfield's great! [soft cheers from the audience]
Justin: Garfield's fine. And really, I got all the bad guys.
Travis: So we didn't really lose anybody important.
Griffin: [crosstalk] How much damage— how much damage does the Vitr— [audience oohs] Aw, man.
Justin: It’s— it’s, um… it’s not even that much… Just 10d4 acid. [audience clamoring]
Griffin: [crosstalk with Travis] You want me to roll that one for ya?
Travis: [loudly] At most— !
Justin: [crosstalk with Travis] Yes, please.
Travis: — You have 49, at most it’s 40 damage, you’ll have nine points left. [scattered laughter] At most!
Griffin: Uh Tr— ‘Ey. Twenty-two.
Clint: Oh.
Justin: Twenty-two, not bad at aaall, [crosstalk] Everybody agreed that was worth it.
Clint: [crosstalk] [sarcastic] Yay, hey.
Griffin: [crosstalk] The eight--the eight--
Clint: [sarcastic, over Griffin] Hooray, we succeed again! [audience laughs]
Griffin: Uhh, the eight suits of armor, the joints sort of connecting them corrode, and they also collapse to the ground: you have taken out all of them. And Scald... [audience cheers] Scald looks pretty bad also. Uh, Scald is up now. Scald takes his hammer, which starts to glow, and he points it at Garfield the Deals Warlock. [soft “oh”s from the audience]
And a rainbow-colored beam shoots out of the tip of the hammer and hits Garfield the Deals Warlock, who is encased in this— this rainbow light as he floats up off the ground, and then there is a flash of light, and then... Garfield is gone, and there’s just a chakram that collapses and falls to the ground, as Garfield has been transformed into a weapon!
[audience screams and protests]
Griffin: [amused] Next in the order is: Magnus Burnsides. [Pause] Also, hey— he wasn’t at [chuckling] the death reunion so... [audience laughs] anything goes! That’s right! It’s not just them I can endanger! [audience settles down] Magnus.
Travis: I’m going to attack with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom that I still have.
Griffin: Okay.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Booooo.
Travis: That’s an 18 plus 10. Twenty-eight.
Griffin: Yup, that does hit.
Travis: Um, [softly] okay. So. [breathes out, then at normal volume] Seven plus 24, that is 31 points of damage.
Griffin: [quietly, impressed] Shit.
[audience cheers]
Travis: And then I attack again. Five plus 10, 15?
Griffin: [beat] He’s hurt real bad. [audience laughs]
Travis: No, no, no, that was my attack. Fifteen.
Griffin: Oh, 15? Fifteen hits with the reduced AC.
Travis: Okay. And so that’s only 26. So that’s… 57. I attack again! [audience laughs] That is a 28!
Griffin: Yeup.
Travis: That’s— mmm— that’s 34 points of damage. [audience cheers] How’s he lookin’?
Griffin: Scald— [pause] steps back. Uhh… [audience laughs]
Justin: He— [laughs] He takes stock of the situation.
Griffin: He takes a deep breath. He says,
Scald: Maybe... you do understand [laughing] the true power of this weapon.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: He says, uh,
Scald: I, uhh, I know enough to admit when I am… outmatched by an adversary.
Griffin: And he, uh… he takes a step back, and he sort of is now resting against one of the pillars at the edge of this room overlooking the Great Fire Sea below, and he says,
Scald: Do you?
Griffin: And he [Travis: No.] falls backwards over the edge.
[pause]
Travis: Oh!
Griffin: [happily] You won!
Travis: Wait, no, this a second form Sephiroth kinda thing, right? [audience laughs]
Griffin: [a beat, then proudly] Then you hear a rumbling from below. [audience cheers]
Travis: Fucking Dark Souls, I knew it.
Griffin: The ground beneath you quakes. Most of the living suits of armor in this room lose their footing and crash to the floor, and then begin reforming themselves amidst the chaos. And then… a massive metal gauntlet rises into view below the cliff’s edge, finding a handhold amongst the pillars at the edge of the room, [a fan yells “Thanos!”] and then it pulls another [crosstalk] into view--
Travis: “Thanos!” [crosstalk] [laughing] Somebody yelled “Thanos”!
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s not fucking Thanos! [audience laughs]
Travis: [loudly and sarcastically] Yup! It’s a Marvel crossover, this is--
Griffin: Yeah. This— we’ve been waiting [crosstalk] to do this--
Travis: This is a sponsored content [dissolving into laughter] episode…
Griffin: And then— and then it pulls another gauntlet into view and you see a gigantic, metal-plate helmet lift up behind the pillars. Its visor is open, and inside controlling this gigantic suit of armor from within... is King Scald. And Scald says,
Scald: I’ve been hoping to forge a larger army before beginning my campaign, but I’m afraid you’ve [enunciating] forced my hand.
Griffin: And he stands up--
Travis: Oh, “hand”, gauntlet… hand.
Griffin: [in amused acceptance] Okay.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: And with that this massive suit of armor stands up to full height. It’s easily ten stories tall. It towers over this castle— you actually see it tuck its fingers in between those pillars at the edge of the room and just rip the ceiling of the throne room and castle off and chuck it into the Great Fire Sea below.
And as it does so, all the smaller suits of armor in this throne room begin floating upward. They’re now following Scald’s massive armor vessel, flocking behind it as this— this gigantic suit of armor stands astride the castle. And these two metal gauntlets, they clap together, and Scald’s voice is amplified as he shouts,
Scald: Rejoice, my creations, for today, our realm takes its rightful place at the center of the planar system!
Griffin: And then you see Scald’s arm with the hammer extend through the visor, and this rainbow-colored beam shoots forward and tears a rift in the fabric of reality itself, and through that tear you see... Neverwinter.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: It is a busy day. Right in the middle of the Merchant’s Quarter there are crowds of people all assembled around a stage, and on that stage you see flowers and balloons, and a marching band performing, and banners hanging from poles reading: “Neverwinter Rises Again!” [audience laughs]
And… and while every face in the crowd looks in shock at your direction through this open rift, you see a familiar face that is, at the moment, oblivious to this threat: behind a podium on stage is Lucretia, who— [audience cheers] who is donning her Bureau of Benevolence regalia and reading a prepared speech from a scroll. She says,
Lucretia: ...but with your months of tireless effort and unceasing charity, the long, arduous rebuilding process has finally concluded. [scattered laughter] Neverwinter has not just recovered from the Hunger’s onslaught, it has been reforged a safer, stronger, more pros— [groaning] Mmm… Mmm… [audience laughs louder] Y— [pause] you have got to be fucking kidding me.
[audience laughs and cheers]
Griffin: And with that, Scald’s massive suit of armor takes one enormous step forward towards the open rift to Neverwinter with a flock of smaller suits of armor flying behind him with weapons drawn. [amused and in a goofy voice] Who’s next in the fucking order? [audience laughs] [normally] It is Merle Highchurch. Merle… What do you do?
Clint: Merle casts Conjure Celestial.
Griffin: O-kay. [audience cheers] What’s that do?
Clint: “You summon a celestial of challenge rating of four or lower which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.”
Griffin: Okay. How is this different from the Della Reese spell?
Clint: Well for one thing, she disappeared after doing 60 damage. [scattered audience laughter]
Griffin: [chuckling] Okay.
Clint: And this is a celestial.
Griffin: So what’s that mean, Mac?
Clint: [laughing in embarrassment] I don’t know [Griffin: Jesus.] what a celestial is! [audience laughs]
Travis: Dad?
Clint: I was hoping one of you did! “The DM has the celestial statistics”, pal! [audience laughs]
Travis: So I guess it’s your fault you don’t know. [more laughter]
Griffin: Does it really fucking say that? Why would you put me on blast like that, Player’s Handbook? [even more laughter]
Clint: Right there. You have those statistics, Griffin.
Griffin: [groaning] Alright.
Travis: [over Griffin, also groaning] I’ll google it.
Griffin: The top result is actually, like 90 Reddit threads like, people like [in a mocking voice] “Where are the fucking statistics?” [audience laughs] Okay. Up to uh… okay. Okay, yeah this is— this is off the website, you get to choose one of the three: a pegasus, a c... “co-dull”? A C-O-U-A-T-L, what is thaaaaa… ? Ah do-do-do it’s like a f— it ju— it’s like a snake with wings, it’s tight.
Clint: M‘kay.
Griffin: A— or a unicorn.
[the audience yells, and several people yelling “unicorn” can be heard over the noise]
Justin: [soft, almost inaudible over the screaming] Nope. [louder as the noise continues] Bi-nicorn.
Justin: Nope, Garyl’s a bi-nicorn. Nope, Garyl’s a bi-nicorn.
Clint: Pleeeease?
Travis: Garyl is a--
Justin: Garyl’s a bi-nicorn, sorry bud.
Travis: But if you wanna summon a unicorn and give 'im a friend.
Justin: No. Nope. That’s my IP, I will take you to court.
[audience laughs]
Travis: Do the pegasus.
Justin: Do a beautiful pegasus.
Travis: [softer, pleading] Do the pegasus—
Clint: I’ll do the pegasus!
Griffin: Okay!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: You— I think you—
Justin: I will give you the name Gregasus. [audience cheers] That’s all I'll give you.
Clint: Gregasus the pegasus.
Griffin: You open the Extreme Teen Bible and I think just Pagemaster style, a Gregasus comes flying out [audience cheers] of the pages and lands beside you. Uh and...
Travis: I think he has the face of every Greg you’ve ever known. [audience laughs]
Griffin: Uhm...
Clint: Can I jump on it? Can… ?
Griffin: Yeah, what do you want Gregasus to do? On Gregasus's turn.
Clint: [stumbling] I’ll— uhm... sss— um, uh, start attacking the s-suits of armor.
Griffin: Okay, go ahead and roll a d20.
[pause]
Clint: [delighted giggling] Hehehehehe.
[audience laughs]
Clint: Nineteen! [audience cheers] Plus... two?
Griffin: Uh, we’re just Calvinballing it at this point, but next in the order was the flying suits of armor. Let’s say that a— a detachment of these suits of armor were flying down to intercept the three of you to keep you from... uh preventing this— this invasion, and Gregasus runs in and just uses tackle on all of them [audience laughs] knocking all effortlessly out of the sky.
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: Uh, next in the order is Taako!
Justin: [sighing] Okay, uhm… I am going to cast… [amused] I’m gonna cast Reduce.
[audience laughs and cheers]
Clint: [laughs]
[a pause, and the audience laughs again]
Griffin: My— [downtrodden] my one like, Pacific Rim-style encounter, and you’re going to reduce it. [audience laughs] How much?
Justin: Just like, one. Just one—
Griffin: [amused] What does the spell say?
Justin: One less. I mean it takes it from… “M” to “G”.
Clint: So still five stories.
Griffin: [bewildered] What?
Justin: Like I guess mass—
Travis: [crosstalk] Mega to giant?
Justin: — Mega to giant?
Griffin: Okay, yeah, now it’s... six stories tall.
Justin: Okay, perfect.
Travis: [crosstalk] So it’s doable.
Griffin: And Scald inside of it also got kind of cuter. [audience laughs]
Justin: Sweet. [satisfied] Okay, I’m good. That’s all I need. Hey baby? That’s step one.
Griffin: Uh, Garfield lays motionless on the floor. [audience laughs]
Justin: As a Chakram!
Griffin: As a Chakram. Next in the order is Scald. Scald, uh, first off, tries to pick up a very large tower made of brass — just tries to rip it out of the ground and can’t because he is, uh, his suit of armor is a little bit smaller than he expected it to be. So instead he picks up a brass outhouse which he launches at the three of yours directions, except — are you riding? You’re not riding Gregasus, you said —
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Oh! Okay. Then it’s just going after you Magnus and Taako. Make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Twenty. Nat.
Justin: Eleven. Not. [pause] Good. Enough.
Griffin: Uh —
Justin: To dodge it.
Griffin: The outhouse comes flying toward Magnus first, and the door kind of like… waves open as it comes, and you just kind of perfectly pass —
Travis: Buster Keaton style?
Griffin: — perfectly pass through it Buster Keaton style, and then the door shuts right as it reaches Taako and it just flattens him. [scattered cheers] Uh, that is twenty-one points of damage from the outhouse.
Justin: Okay.
Travis: We’re big boys.
Justin: Good.
Griffin: Uh, and then for its second attack, the massive — or less… the giant armor, I guess — tries to throw a punch at Gregasus and Merle. [pause to roll] That is a nat failure. [audience cheers]
Clint: Wait a minute, wait a minute. [scattered laughter]
Griffin: Yeah, it’s sick.
Travis: And actually Merle healed!
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: He just avoided some— (?)
Griffin: Yeah, next in the order is Magnus.
Travis: Uh, Magnus laughs.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Okay, now it’s my turn —
Travis: — for a free action. Um, and then grappling hooks to the open visor. [scattered cheers]
Griffin: Oof. Alright. I’m gonna make you do a…
Travis: Acrobatics?
Griffin: Acrobatics, probably, cuz this thing is pretty high up there and it just took a big step away from —
Travis: Or an athletics check.
Several Voices: Yeah.
Griffin: Sure, either one.
Travis: Okay. So that’s... a nineteen.
Griffin: Uh, okay. Uh, I’ll make you a deal. With a nineteen you can get up there, but it’s not gonna be like a clean entry —
Travis: — that’s fine —
Griffin: — into the visor, and, uh —
Travis: — I’ll take some damage.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, I think he gets an attack of opportunity against you as you come inside.
Travis: ‘kay.
Griffin: He swings over the like control panel with his hammer and… ooh, damn, that is a… twenty-seven versus AC.
Travis: Oh yeah, that’s hits…
Griffin: I’m gonna say because he’s one size smaller than he was before [scattered laughs] that is fifteen points of damage.
Travis: Oh, okay. So I’m just down to a hundred.
Griffin: Yeah, can you angle your mic? [audience laughs]
Travis: Hmm?
Griffin: You need to talk into the microphone. Uh… yes.
Travis: [louder] I’m down to a hundred.
Griffin: Yes. What do you do now —
Travis: Remember when I said Magnus laughs?
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: He triggers his magnetic charge…
Griffin: [soft surprise] Oh.
Travis: [reading] A fist-sized glass ball with a blue button on top. Once the button is pressed the ball will begin to glow and produce a magnetic field that lasts two rounds of combat. The field repels any metal object within ten feet from the ball. [audience cheers] [audience bell rings]
Griffin: Alright. [audience laughs] The entire flock of armor flying behind this thing just… whoosh. Like, like confetti through the air, just kinda get scattered around the town. Just pieces sort of flying down into the city of brass. There are some salamander citizens now who kinda came out of their houses to look at things — are like dodging the debris back and forth. Um. Nothing happens to the giant suit of armor, uh and Scald laughs and he says — and he points to the helmet behind him and all around him, and he says,
Scald: Tin!
[audience laughs and cheers]
Justin (?): [laughs]
Travis (?): [laughs louder] [makes “MmmmMMmm” sound]
Griffin: Merle, you’re up.
Clint: Um… Merle swoops down—
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: —on Gregasus the Pegasus.
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: Grabs the chakras.
Griffin: Chakram.
Clint: Chakram.
Griffin: You know what that is, right? Like from Xena?
Clint: No, yeah! Yeah!
Griffin: [skeptically] You do know what it is?
[crosstalk]
Clint: Yeah, it’s the round thing!
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: Yeah! And…
Griffin: [amused] It’s a round, bladed weapon. Okay. Xena threw it at, like, everyone, ever. [some audience members cheer] Do you all not fucking— you all came here for DragonCon, do you not fucking know who Xena, Warrior Princess is?! [audience cheers loudly] Like, I’m not like fishing for cheers, it just seemed like people were like, [timid voice] “Oh, yeah, Xena.” Like, ahh? (?) Alright.
Clint: And the Merle… uh, throws it.
Justin: Good start, good start.
Clint: Throws it…
Justin: At…
Clint: He gets as close he can on Gregasus the Pegasus and still have a turn left.
Griffin: Okay— [laughs]
Clint: And throws it… at…
Griffin: Scald.
Clint: Yeah, but Magnus is in the way…
Griffin: Yeah, roll a d20.
Travis: You can’t say “Magnus is in the way”! Like, you just put me—
Griffin: No, you’re wicked in the way.
Travis: [sighs unhappily]
Clint: 7… plus, what? What do I—
Travis: No.
Griffin: You know what, I’m gonna give you advantage, because Gregasus is here to cheer you on, he says—
Travis: Roll again, old man!
Gregasus: Roll again, Mac.
Clint: Three!
Griffin: Alright, I did my best. [audience cheers] With that throw, the— [chuckles]
Clint: Wait! And, yells,
Merle: Here, Magnus, catch this!
Griffin: Yeah. He catches it, alright. [audience laughs]
Clint: And goes,
Merle: [high-pitched war cry]
Griffin: Yeah. Luckily, the heavy metal armor that Magnus picked up in the castle protects him from most of the blow. You only take 7 points of damage, as Garfield tries to cut into your body meat.
Clint: Which he made.
Griffin: But doesn’t quite make it through. And Garfield then falls out of the open visor and plummets to the ground below. He’s made of metal, so it’s probably fine.
Travis: No, it would stick in!
Griffin: Okay, yeah, it’s stuck into your shoulder. That’s fun. Uh, Taako. You are now up.
Justin: I am going to… cast… on myself… Polymorph. [audience cheers] I am going to transform into the canonical Dungeons & Dragons creature, a Tyrannosaurus rex, named Dupree. [audience cheers]
Griffin: [loud and excited] This is that Pacific Rim shit!
Justin: Yeah. But like—
Travis: I just wanna say, canonically, Magnus just got so excited to see Dupree again.
Justin: Yeah. But like, if you think about— You said 60 stories, and I thought—
Griffin: No no, 10—
Justin: You said six stories at first, or 10 stories at first, and I was like, okay. I don’t know how big Tyrannosauruses rexes is? But it’s not 10 stories big, for sure. So I had to knock you down a peg. And then I could Dupree.
Griffin: Let’s make it fun!
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Why don’t you roll a d20 and we’ll see how big Dupree turns up. [audience cheers]
Justin: That is a 17. [audience cheers]
Griffin: Dupree’s about seven stories tall.
Travis: Nice. [audience cheers] And I want you to picture every little kid from every good Godzilla movie? Like, “Dupree!” That’s Magnus right now.
Griffin: Yeah, sure. I think all this time, Scald and his massive suit of armor has been taking one step closer and one step closer to the rift, but as he feels you transform, he turns to face you. What do you do?
Justin: Um… That’s actually my entire action, I have nothing I can do. I mean, I can look at ’im and go [T-rex growling noise], but I’m gonna— Not a lot of sassy lines with a T-rex. The think-meat, you see, is very small.
Griffin: That was Taako’s action. This is Dupree’s action.
Travis: Ha-ha! [audience cheers]
Justin: Dupree is going to bite the face of the thing! [audience cheers] Not smart. Don’t know if that’s smart or not. Not a smart creature.
Griffin: It’s Dupree! Dupree acts on instinct!
Justin: Dupree is aaall instinct, my man. Uh, here’s the other thing: [laughing] don’t know how to do melee attacks at all! One hundred percent.
Travis: Roll!
Justin: Here, I’ll roll this. It’s plus 10 to hit? Is that good or bad?
Travis and Justin: 16!
Justin: 16 plus 10 to hit. Is that 26? Is that right?
Griffin: That is a 26, yes.
Justin: Okay!
Griffin: You know, just— Magnus is up ins— the helmet—
Travis: That’s okay! Magnus is a beefy boy.
Griffin: Alright.
Travis: There’s plenty of bitin’ to go around!
Justin: The hit is… So that’s a hit, it’s 4d12 plus 7? [audience cheers]
Travis: I’m still fine! Even at most, I’m doin’ okay.
Griffin: [with some dread] Do you have the d12 dice? I got one. You want me to roll it for you?
Justin: You don’t have a machine over there that’ll do it?
Griffin: Okay. [makes ‘boop’ing sounds] 33. 33!
Travis: Wow. That’s wild.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah. You bite the visor clean off this thing. Magnus, you’re gonna get some of the teeth.
Magnus: That’s fine!
Griffin: Let’s say half that, so whatever half of 33 is. Uh… and… uh… [audience members yell something] I know, it was a joke. And Scald is gonna take some bad, bad hit stuff too. Okay.
Justin: Now it’s time for Dupree’s attack against the armor. The huge metal armor. That one was against Scald. This is a different target, this is with his tail, he’s gonna hit its legs as hard as he fuckin’ can.
Griffin: [delighted] Okay!
Justin: That’s a 19, plus 10, 29, Du-preee! [audience cheers] That’s 3d8 plus 7.
Griffin: Jesus, Dupree.
Justin: It’s— yeah. It’s good. I can actually do that one. 5… 4… 8… So 5, 9— 17. Plus… 7. 24.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Bludgeoning damage, I don’t know if that matters.
Griffin: Sure, no, it matters.
Justin: I’m not used to doing damage.
Griffin: Yes. Okay, with that, the two legs go flying. The two legs just come off below the knee, the foot part of the… uh… the… what are the leg parts of armor called?
Justin: Haunches.
Griffin: The haunches of the armor go flying off.
Clint: What are greaves?
Justin: The paul— pauldrons?
[crosstalk about pauldrons and greaves]
Travis: Greaves? I think they’re greaves.
Griffin: Yes. Maybe. And so, anyway, the leg parts of the armor go flying away, and—
Travis: [amused] The drumsticks.
Griffin: I think everything— What happens next is kind of in slow motion. Magnus, you are six stories off the ground in this helmet with King Scald, a little bit closer to the exit of the helmet, but now you feel yourself in freefall inside of this helmet. What do you do to not die?
Travis: Oh, here’s the thing! We started this fight at 11:58, and now it’s 12:01 AM, and I use the grappling hook again! [audience cheers] Time is different! In the planar realm!
Griffin: No, I love it! That’s good, yeah! Sure! You hear, actually, a clock tower in the distance and you know—
Travis: Bong! And I’m like,
Magnus: Oh, shit!
Travis: And I use the grappling hook again to grapple back. And I grab the chak— oh, chakram’s in my shoulder.
Griffin: Right.
Travis: Chakram.
Griffin: Yeah. And you fly right on out of there— what are you attaching it to? Just, some shit?
Travis: [amused] To Taako. [audience laughs]
Griffin: Oh, to Dupree?
Travis: Yeah, well he’s Dupree!
Griffin: Yeah, I love it!
Justin: I’m Dupree, it’s fine.
Griffin: He can take it. Alright.
Justin: Don’t even feel it.
Griffin: Yeah, it latches into Dupree’s meat, he doesn’t even fuckin’ care.
Dupree: [growls]
Travis: Dupree catches it, and is like, “Come on in, my buddy.”
Griffin: Yeah. Reels ’im on in. You just sort of effortlessly just kind of zoom out of the visor as Scald falls down six stories with the helmet, and the armor goes crashing to the ground and as he goes falling, his concentration is interrupted and the rift closes. And right as it does, you see Lucretia like,
Lucretia: [baffled] Okay…!
[audience laughs and cheers]
Griffin: And the armor crashes to the ground and the pieces go flying everywhere and the helmet rolls to a stop. And King Scald just kind of oozes out of the visor, uh, and he has been destroyed. [audience cheers]
Travis: Does that break his spell on everything?
Griffin: What’s that?
Travis: Does that break his spell on everything, or?
Griffin: And with that!
Travis: [quietly] Okay.
Griffin: The weapons and the armor that had been flung to the ground by the magnetic charge, they start to levitate. And they are encased in that same sort of shimmering rainbow light. Garfield is just sitting on your shoulder like,
Garfield: Hey! That was weird!
Griffin: And all of these pieces of armor and all these weapons transform back into their original salamander forms. And the salamander who is wearing a circlet and is wearing this golden white chainmail tunic approaches you and she says,
Ashspine: You’ve done a great service for us this day, off-worlders. My name is Queen Ashspine.
Magnus: Uh huh.
Ashspine: I’ve been a… I’ve been a… I’ve been a polearm for some time—
Magnus: [quietly] Mhm. Yeah.
Ashspine: — thanks to my husband’s dick brother! [audience laughs] I take it you have killed him.
Magnus: Yeah.
Ashspine: Fantastic, fantastic. [audience laughs] Whatever power he exerted over our people has faded, although...
Griffin: And she looks at the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom on your back and she says,
Ashspine: Wrathfang, my love, you can return to your original form now!
Merle: Oh well!
Magnus: No! Hold on!
Griffin: And the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom begins to shimmer in this multi-colored light!
Travis: No, Griffin, it doesn’t! [nervous laughter, audience cheers]
Griffin: And it lifts out of your hand and it floats in the air and it’s giving off this blinding light. And when it fades, you see, laying at your feet, the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom. [audience cheers]
Clint: [sighs in relief]
Griffin: And—
Justin: It was a sword!
Griffin: And Queen Ash— Queen Ashspine—
Justin: The king was a sword the whole time! [audience laughs]
Griffin: And Queen Ashspine says,
Ashspine: Hm. It seems he believes his work with your party is not quite at an end.
[audience cheers]
Travis: [relieved] Fuck, yes! [noise of relief]
Griffin: That is—
Justin: And then— okay, and then, Dupree changes back into Taako, and he’s like,
Taako: Are you sure? Because, it seems like balance-wise, you’ve written yourself a great out, for, like, balance. Just from like a balance perspective?
Magnus: Capital B.
Taako: Capital— no, lowercase! It seems like—
Justin: I’m just shou— he’s just shouting to the air.
Griffin: Yeah.
Taako: Like it seems like, balance-wise,—
[audience laughs]
Magnus: It’s fine, go on, what were you saying?
Taako: It might be better—
Magnus: Yeah, and your thing about—
Taako: If we didn’t have it—
Griffin: Queen Ashspine says,
Ashspine: Yeah, I mean, it’s kind of a bummer, that’s my husband and he’s a sword, but—
Taako: Yeah, for sure that, but also just from a—
Magnus: I promise you I’ll never lose him.
Griffin: With that, a curtain is shut in front of all three of you, and you’re back in the dressing room. And Garfield says,
Garfield: Well, all’s well that ends well!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: And he floats to another booth several feet away, and slides another curtain open, and through it, you see Neverwinter. You see Lucretia directing the city guard to aid a few civilians who were sort of injured in the panicked evacuation of the town square. You see a lot of Neverwintians— Neverwinterians— sort of looking generally pretty confused. And Garfield comes up to you and he says,
Garfield: Well, I suppose I owe you all big time now! Like I promised, I’ll have my lawyer draw up paperwork to transfer some shares to my company, once— I don’t really know how that works, again, but—
Magnus: None of us do!
Garfield: Yeah, I’m hopin’ my lawyers do! Anyway, I think you’re gonna find it a worthwhile investment! Somethin’ tells me my fortunes will be turning around very soon!
Griffin: And he shuts a curtain behind you and all three of you are in Neverwinter. And then we see Garfield, still in the fitting room, and he reaches into his Bag of Holding, and pulls out Scald’s magic hammer. [audience ‘ooh’s] That is the end of our adventure! Thank you all so much for coming! [audience cheers] This has been The Adventure Zone! Thank you all, enjoy DragonCon, goodbye!

[Intro music fades in, audience cheers.]
Griffin: Uh—
Clint: Hey!
Justin: If you were doing a documentary about us. That would be the moment that you just saw, where you’d be like, “And after that, it all went wrong.”
Travis: I brought some hard candy that I was gonna like, fling out into the audience.
Griffin: No, I told him it’s— [crosstalk]
Travis: Griffin told me not to do it but it sounds like...
Griffin: It’s fucking jawbreakers, those would be—those have a ballistic property—
Clint: You’ll put an eye out! You’ll put an eye out!
Griffin: This is probably not allowed. Look at that. [Audience still cheering]
Clint: Don’t forget the balcony, Travis.
Justin: “After Travis blinded an extremely litigious Austinite with his jawbreakers…”
Travis: That’s gonna be it. I have a lot more, but I’ll just eat those during the show.
Justin: “It all fell apart after that.”
Griffin: I wanna thank… Oh, shit.
[Cheering, laughter as Clint puts a big bottle of Gatorade on the table]
Travis: A good start.
Clint: Boy, I have no— [unidentifiable]
Justin: I hope everybody’s getting psyched, apparently halfway through Dad’s gonna run a fuckin marathon. Just like, blast the electrolytes.
Griffin: Uh—
Justin: ‘What are you doing tonight Clint?’ ‘Uh, podcast and rugby for four hours apparently.’
Griffin: I’m glad you guys dressed up for this.
Travis: I didn’t.
Griffin: Oh. I was gonna say, I’m confused why you decided to cosplay as Tingle, Travis Touchdown and M. Bison from the Street Fighter movie.
Travis: This is Stolen Century Magnus.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: He’s kind of a Johnny Storm type.
Travis: I will have to change glasses though because these are not prescription.
Justin: Hey, hey, uh, did anybody bring spell cards?
[Laughter, faint YES]
Griffin: Did you really?
Justin: Come on up!
[Long and loud applause]
Travis: Here.
Griffin: Sick as hell.
Travis: [muffled by audience cheering] Do you want some hard candy?
Griffin: [through laughter] Hold on wait, hold on wait, did anybody bring cleric spell cards?
Clint: Did anybody else bring cleric spell cards?...And a hush falls over the room. [A hush actually falls over the room]
Travis: That’s ‘cause no one plays as clerics.
Justin: That’s from an imaginary world where Dad uses those spells at all, to heal.
Griffin: Well, we’re gonna have to figure that out as we go, huh?
Clint: I’ll just make the shit up as I usually do.
Travis: Do you guys know what spells Merle has?
[audience yells Zone of Truth!]
Travis: Thank you.
Clint: What was that again?
[audience yells Zone! of! Truth!]
Travis: Don’t play into that, he knew exactly what you said.
Clint: I have an eyepatch, I can’t hear very well…
Travis: Get out, M. Bison.
Griffin: Um.
Justin: My man, what was your— who brought me the cards, what’s your name?
Audience member: Joe.
Griffin: Joe?
Justin: Sorry?
Joe: Joe!
Justin: Joe, please don’t let me forget to give these back to you, I’ll feel bad forever. [laughter]
Griffin: Y’all wanna get started?
Travis: Yes!
[cheering]
Griffin: I’m trying— we’re trying a new thing. Travis got me this soundboard for my birthday, and so I have some music cues, and so like, I’m gonna try and put some music in it, and if it doesn’t go well I’m just gonna stop doing it in the middle of the show.
Travis: We also each bought new dice for this show. Griffin and I by choice—
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Dad and Justin because they just didn’t bring ‘em.
Justin: And I— I let Charlie pick mine, so: [shows Hello Kitty dice]
[cheering]
Griffin: Let’s play Dungeons and Dragons.
Justin: Hell yeah!
Travis: This is fun, we haven’t played Dungeons and Dragons in a while.
Griffin: S— Oh shit, we haven’t played Dungeons and Dragons in like, three months.
Justin: We were having a mini panic attack about it, yeah.
Clint: No.
Griffin: So. Uh, the three of you awaken to the sound of a bell chiming nine times. And just now I’m realizing that would’ve been a super good sound to get on my soundboard.
Clint[?]: Bong, bong, bong, bongbongbongbongbongbongbong.
Griffin: So, the three of you wake up, and you are in bed in your dorm room, and you throw open the curtains, and it’s just a lovely day outside. You see the Grand Library next to this big shiny glass cube, and you can see students reading and studying and milling about.
And you see wagons below, and they’re bringing in hoards of townies who swarm into the school’s main entrance. You see some sort of athletic team running drills on a really well-manicured field across the road. Um, it’s a really busy scene, and it’s one you’re well-accustomed to seeing every morning when you wake up here, at Neverwinter High School.
[audience cheers]
[Persona 4 - Pursuing My True Self plays]
Clint: Is that our alma mater?
Griffin: No, uhhhh, all three of you make a wisdom-saving throw for me.
[music stops]
Clint: Which one is that?
Travis: The 20-sided one.
Clint: The 20-sided one?
Travis: Woah, that’s not good! Thanks, new dice, that’s a threeeeee!
Justin: 15. [crosstalk]
Travis: I’m dumb!
Clint: Holy shit, it’s an 18!
Griffin: Hey, all right!
Travis: Should we switch?
Clint: Why now?! Why now?
Griffin: Magnus, it’s another day of high school!
Travis: Sounds about right!
Griffin: Uh, Taako and Merle, you immediately realize something horrible has gone wrong.
[Laughter]
Travis: Thanks, new dice.
Griffin: Do you just wanna take the eyepatch off or?
Clint: Only when I wanna see.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Well ever since the whole drop-the-Gatorade incident.
Griffin: Taako and Merle, you remember going to sleep in the real world at the Bureau of Balance Headquarters and waking up in this weird high school dorm room? You have to, I imagine, clue Magnus into this fact.
Magnus: Whaaaaaat?!
Griffin: Yeah, Magnus, I think you were like, [singsong] excited for a new day, got my new Jansport. Got a new binder and it’s... blue! Justin, should we walk off the stage for like, 15 minutes while you shuffle your deck?
Justin: Blame Joe!
Griffin: Joe, why didn’t you have your spellcards sorted in the way—
Travis: Joe!
Justin: Nah nah, you’re good, Joe, thank you.
Griffin: Before we get started, I wanted to ask, what were the three of you like in high school? Obviously you didn’t go to high school together, or in Neverwinter, but here you are. What is your high school persona like?
Travis: I’m gonna give of you a name, Griffin.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And that name is A.C. Slater.
[cheers, laughter]
Travis: And that stands for Ability Check Slater.
Griffin: [laughs] Armor Class would work too ‘cuz that’s what AC stands for.
Travis: Oh, that also works!
Griffin: But okay.
Travis: I’ll go as D.C. Slater.
Griffin: Okay. Uh, Merle?
Clint: Ummmm, this may surprise you, but I got my ass kicked on a regular basis in high school.
[audience awwws]
Griffin: Oh no…
Travis: Don’t— this is imaginary!
Clint: It was very— Oh!
Travis: Don’t be sad.
Griffin: It’s imaginary, yeah.
Clint: Imaginary? Oh, I was the king of the campus.
Griffin: Oh no!
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Now it’s got layers of sadness!
Clint: I uhhh was president of the—
Travis: World?
Clint: Chess club world. And I had a great hot rod.
[Audience yelps in delight]
Travis: If you know what I mean…
Griffin: No! Nope!
Clint: I’m a grandfather!
Griffin: Taako. What was Taako like in high school?
Justin: Ummmm, the coolest? One at the school. I think Taako had a devoted following of people—
[Clint laughs, a few audience members squeal]
Justin: Not everybody got him, but the people that did were into it.
Griffin: So it sounds like we have three A.C. Slaters on our hands maybe, a little bit.
Justin: No, like, I’m more— I’m more like—
Griffin: Zack Morris?
Travis: Yeah!
Justin: Like the Decemberists of cool. You know? And Travis is Aerosmith I guess?
Griffin: All right.
Travis: Whoa! Don’t you put that on me!
Justin: This was before The Decemberists were in like, AT&T commercials or whatever. I’m just kiddin’ Decemberists, I love you guys.
Clint: Who— Who?
Travis: Are the Decemberists here tonight?
[Scattered audience members cheer]
Justin: Yeah they— they said.
Griffin: Holy shit, that’s a big band!
Travis: Don’t woo! Are you the Polyphonic Spree? How many of you are there?!
Justin: [crosstalk] Did Arcade Fire come out?
Clint: Who are the Decemberists?
Travis: Ooh, guhhhh… [crosstalk]
Griffin: So— [crosstalk]
Travis: That one’s not a joke!
Griffin: So the three of you leave the uh, the dorm room that you share.
Clint: Aww…
Griffin: There’s not usually a three-person dorm room, I’m imagining like a Terrace House bedroom situation—
[cheering]
Griffin: You make your way into the dorm’s common room, and it’s quiet in here. First period is about to begin, so most of the students have run off into the classroom building. There’s one student here, though, and he’s sitting on a couch in the middle of the common area with just this big pile of books splayed out in front of him. And he’s reading one of them, he’s drinking this really strong-smelling tea. And as you enter, he turns his bespectacled face towards you and says:
[Deeper normal Griffin voice]: Hello, sirs.
[cheering, laughter]
Griffin: Sure enough, you see a high school aged Angus McDonald.
[more cheering]
Griffin: And And he looks—
Travis: Super buff!
Griffin: Yeah, he’s gotten yoked. He’s ripped. He’s like, he looks like he’s undergone like, four or five growth spurts. He’s about your size, Magnus.
Travis: Get out!
Griffin: And he says,
Angus: You should get a move on. You all are gonna be late for class.
Travis: Nerd!
Taako: Angus, what’s uhhh, going on?
Angus: What do you mean, sir?
Taako: Okay, lemme ask that in a different que— way, uh. Do you think anything weird’s going on?
Angus: Uh, you three are running late for class. I don’t—
Taako: Alright, thanks, Ango, that’ll do it!
Angus: No, tell me, what’s— lemme help you out, what’s the situation? You seem out of sorts.
Travis: I don’t like this smooth jazz Angus. [imitating voice] Hey, you tell me, what’s wrong?
Angus: This is just my voice—
Justin/Travis: I’m listening.
Angus: I hit puberty [pronounced poo-ber-dee] and it just happened.
Magnus: Wait, you hit what?
Merle: It’s pronounced poo-BEHR-tee.
Angus: Sorry. What’s going on, tell me, you seem—
Travis: Griffin, I would like to do a strength check to try to take his book away and hold it over his head.
Griffin: All right. This will be a strength contest.
Travis: That’s nothing. Why are these new dice so bad?
Griffin: I got a 25. He’s like— [Griffin gestures]
Clint: Well, he only rolled a 4, so you’ll—
Travis: Yeah I got a 8— 9— to be fair, I got a 12.
Clint: Give him a wedgie!
Griffin: He dislocates your shoulder when you pull the book away. He says,
Angus: What— What’s going on, what’s the matter?
Taako: Uhh. Mm.
Magnus: Well, when last we saw you, you were, uhhh—
Merle: A twerp!
Magnus: Uh, a child?
Angus: Okay, I’m… okay.
Magnus: And we were not.
Taako: Yeah, we were— we were— we’re grown folk.
Angus: You’re saying this is some sort of—
Taako: Exactly.
Merle: Imbroglio.
Angus: Well, that sounds like you could be going through any number of things.
Taako: I mean, probably magic.
Magnus: Could be a dream?
Taako: I don’t wanna get too Law & Order here.
Angus: Have you— have you tried poking through the walls? Maybe it’s just one big illusion?
Travis: I run at the wall.
Griffin: It’s a— It’s a hard— It’s a hard, hard wall.
Magnus: Ow! Not that!
Angus: You could’ve gone back in time, but did you all—
Travis: I try to go forward in time.
Taako: Well, Ango, if we had gone back in time, you would be younger, or nonexistent. Oh, what a fantasy!
Angus: Maybe it’s some sort of parallel dimension? No, that’d be lame. Um… Maybe it could be a dream? But the fact that you all realize something was wrong makes it sound like you’re all in the same dream…
Magnus: I didn’t. To be fair, I didn’t. I’m wicked stupid.
Angus: Okay.
Justin: Can I just say? The extent to which Angus has bought into this and the speed at which he has bought into this is truly upsetting.
Griffin: Listen, he’s a—
Justin: Like, that is a man whose grasp of reality is like, razor-thin.
Griffin: He’s an eru— an erudite young man, and he’s quick on his feet who realizes something’s wrong and his entire life in this universe is a lie and a dream. Maybe.
Justin: Yeah, he’s like, ready to ride it out
Travis: It’s possible we’re just all on Salvia.
[Long pause]
Griffin: You’ve ruined the Act III twist… He says,
Angus: Why don’t you let me look into this.
Griffin: And he piles up a few books off the table.
Angus: You should really get to class though. Do you know where you’re going?
Travis: Oh god, this is my dream all over again!
Clint: Do we have pants on?
Griffin: He says,
Angus: Hey, uh Brody, can you show ‘em the way?
Travis: Who?
Griffin: Uh, and in the corner— I just heard 12 people in the audience go [disgusted] ‘Brody?’ I’m allowed to do new characters, it doesn’t have to all be fuckin’ callbacks. In the corner you see a young man who, surprisingly you haven’t noticed until now. He’s wearing a bright red T-shirt underneath a bright green nylon jacket with bright blue sleeves. He’s wearing sunglass—
[mixed audience reaction of horror and disgust]
What was that reaction? He’s wearing sunglasses even though he’s been indoors this entire time, and when Angus mentions his name, he puts down this enormous fucking Stone of Farspeech. Uh, and he sets it down on the table next to him. And—
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, I see.
Griffin: He tucks it into the pocket of his faded jeans, and this isn’t Barry. Barry’s not the only one that gets to wear blue jeans in this universe. And he skateboards up to you guys from like, six feet away.
Justin: [gagging noises]
Griffin: And he says uh,
Brody: [nasally nerdbro voice] What’s up Tres Horny Boys? You guys ready for another day of boring old school? Ughhckk, homework, riiiight?
Magnus: Brody, I’m— I’m gonna stop you right there for just one second, if I could talk to Taako just for a second.
Justin: Uh, you’re gonna have to talk loud cuz the moment Brody came a-runnin, Taako was like repulsed backwards. Like, like a thirty-foot radius forcefield around Brody,
Taako: Noooooooope!
Magnus: Is it just me, or is this dude the coolest?
Merle: [singsong] It’s just youuuuuu.
Magnus: Fair enough!
Griffin: He does a kickflip standing still—
Magnus: Whooooooooaaaaaa!!
Griffin: He says,
Brody: Come on, I’ll show you around the classroom building, or as I call it, the cellblock, riiight?
Magnus: Whooooooooooooooooaaaaaa!!!
Justin: Audience, please don’t encourage Brody.
[cheering]
Brody: Brody really needed that, thanks!
Griffin: So Brody skates you down the long hallways of the classroom building.
Travis: Are we like, jogging behind him to keep up? Like [exhausted panting]
Griffin: He’s a courteous, uh, skater. He’s going—
Clint: He’s going serpentine so we can stay up with him.
Griffin: He’s going at more of a canter. And the classroom building halls are lined with these windows offering you more spectacular views of the campus outside. But the halls are fairly empty. First period has started and so most of the students here are already tucked away in the various classes that you are passing by here on your skateboard tour. There’s calculus and history and music theory and speech & debate and so on. There are adminis— some speech and debate fans out there.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: There are some administrative rooms, big teacher’s lounge, student council room, an AV room. And from your dorm you entered onto the third floor of the classroom building, and at the far end of this hall is a bridge leading into the practice building. And every few dozens feet or so are vending machines advertising strange potions with fantastical names like Snapple and Fruitopia.
Travis: Griffin, can I roll to buy a Snapple?
Griffin: You don’t have to roll, do you challenge the Snapple machine?
Travis: I do, I wanna shake a Snapple loose, I don’t wanna pay for it.
Griffin: Oh, okay. You kind of—
Travis: Oh, you know what, I’m gonna Fonzi punch it. [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, of course, look at you.
Travis: I’m gonna Fonz it.
Justin: Of course.
Griffin: Yeah, of course, look at you.
Travis: Yeah! That’s a 19!
Griffin: That’s your roll. Uhh, a Snapple and a Fruitopia fall out.
Travis: Eyyyyyyyy. I toss the Fruitopia to… Taako.
Griffin: Oh, hear that Merle?
Taako: Hell yeah!
Merle: No, I’m fine, don’t worry about my ass.
Griffin: But you have your fuckin gallon of Gatorade over there.
Clint: This is real!
Griffin: This is all real to—
Justin: Someone listening to this episode later just said— ‘Ohhh, he has a big jug of Gatorade. The thing from earlier make total sense now!’
Travis: Griffin, I slam the Snapple in one.
[pause]
Griffin: …Okay.
Travis: And then I read the cap. What’s the cap say, Griffin?
Griffin: The cap of the Snapple?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Says uh, this was poi— this was poisoned.
Clint: Did you know that if you turn the tab around on a can of soda, it’s a straw holder?
Griffin: Whoooa, it says that on the Snapple?
Travis: They’re advertising for soda.
Griffin: [crosstalk] For canned beverages now.
Travis: What a cross promotion.
Justin: Their slogan for years has been, “You’re wasting your time with Snapple!”
Travis: “What’re you doing, there’s soda out there!”
Griffin: Brody points down a hallway and says
Brody: Your guys’ classes, or should I say your ppprrriiison cellllllllllllls.
Taako: All right, Brody.
Brody: Should be down here. Try not to let— Try not to let ‘em keep ya down, all right?
Magnus: It’s not Gattaca, Brody, come on!
Brody: Later, skaterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrs.
Griffin: And then he pivots on his board and he skates down the stairwell and just grinds out of sight.
Magnus: Taako, I’ve turned on Brody.
Merle: Can we kill him later?
Magnus: Yes, we can!
Griffin: Aww riiii—
Travis: He’s definitely the Big Bad. Don’t you worry.
Griffin: You’re walking down the hallway toward this row of classes at the end, and as you approach, you smell something coming from the bathrooms. Cigarettes.
Travis: Marijua—
Clint: Whaaat?
[audience boos]
Griffin: And out of the bath— booooo. And out of the bathrooms walks three ruffians of varying sizes. Their hair is greased back and they’re wearing matching leather jackets emblazoned with a hammerhead. Marvey—
[cheering]
Griffin: It’s Marvey, Jerreeeeee, and Little Jerry.
Justin: Noooo!
[more cheering]
Travis: Griffin, did you say the name of the school was Fanservice High?
Griffin: Listen, it’s front-loaded.
Justin: [through laughter] Also, for all those Marvey and Jerreeeeee fans out there, they’re [laughing wheeze] back!
Griffin: And Marvey— Marvey says,
Maarvey: Well look who we got here—
Travis: I punch him. [rolls dice] 20! Nat 20!
[cheering]
Clint: Crit nat 20. [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] YEAH!
[continued cheering]
Griffin: Alright, roll damage.
Travis: I don’t know what my unarmed is—
Griffin: It’s uh, one d4 plus your strength. It’s not a big hit, but it’s a—
Travis: Wait, do I have Phantom Fist?
Griffin: No. Oh, and yeah you guys don’t have any of your, your stuff.
Travis: Oh, no, one d4.
Justin: But I do have the Umbrastaff, right?
Griffin: No.
Justin: Can somebody come take the Umbrastaff, please?
Travis: Three… plus…
Justin: I’m just kidd— I’m just kidding, I’m go—
Travis: Uh… three plus four, so seven.
Griffin: Okay. Marvey then says a few—
Travis: Oh, wait. Hold on. It was a crit 20.
Griffin: Oh yeah, you roll double damage.
Travis: That’s another four, so that’s uh, is uh… fifteen.
[brief pause]
Griffin: WHAT THE FUCK?
Travis: Double damage is four and three plus four plus four.
Griffin: [indignant] I DIDN’T GIVE MARVEY HP!
[laughter]
Griffin: I GUESS I—
Travis: I’M LATE FOR CLASS!
Justin: Yeah..
Travis: I DON’T HAVE TIME FOR BANTER!
Griffin: Alright you– he says,
Maarvey: Tryin’ to get to class, little fishie? No problem as long as you pick—
[Griffin mimes getting punched in the face, audience laughter]
Griffin: Uh, little Jerry says,
Little Jerry: Hey! Come on!
Griffin: Uh, and, I think Little Jerry and Jerreeeeee are going to attack you I guess. Now we’re just having an impromptu hall fight!
[laughter, then cheers]
Justin: Uh, I, okay, before anybody can do anything, I quickly reach into my bag of components and cast ‘fold my arms and chill.’
[laughter while audience cheers]
Justin: [laughing] Cuz dumb-dumb here decided to start a fight.
Travis: Now, I know how this works. First day you’ve gotta punch the biggest person you see.
Griffin: I guess. That was a 12 and an 18 versus A.C.
Travis: Uh… well— wh— no, no both of those miss.
Griffin: Okay. You fight off Jerreeeeee and Little Jerry...
[crosstalk]
Travis: I punch them back!
Griffin: Oh my god.
[audience laughter]
Travis: [shouting] 20! Critical hiiiiit!
Clint: God!
[audience cheering]
[indistinguishable]
Griffin: [weary] … Okay.
Travis: That’s a four and a two so six plus eight. 14.
[crosstalk]
Griffin: Who— who was that for?
Travis: Uh, Little Jerry.
Griffin: [laughing] Alright.
[audience laughter and cheering]
Clint: Thank god you didn’t save this for the end of the—
[cross talk]
Griffin: Yeah, I know. Okay, Little Jerry is down on the ground now with Marvey and uh, you see them kinda scramble to their feet, and get ready to launch a counterattack but you hear footsteps coming down the hallway.
Uh, and you hear someone clear their throat and when you look to the source of the interjection you see a dark-haired man wearing black and gray robes and he has a large silver medallion around his neck. Uh, and he walks towards you and the Hammerhead gang sorta rights themselves and they fix their hair and they say in unison:
Hammerheads: Good morning, Principal Hawthorne!
Griffin: Uh and he says:
Principal Hawthorne: [slowly] You boys weren’t fighting were you?
Magnus: No, sir! [crosstalk]
Principal Hawthorne: [crosstalk] You do know– You know the consequences of fighting at Neverwinter High.
Magnus: Death.
Merle: Hit him, hit him, Magnus!
Magnus: Nope!
Merle: Hit, Mr Hawthorne!
Magnus: I respect authority. I am lawful good.
[Audience laughter]
Griffin: He kind of— [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] My ass.
Griffin: He kind of surveys the scene and sees which side of this, uh, fight has more bloody noses, and he points to the Hammerheads and he says,
Principal Hawthorne: You three get to class.
Griffin: And they scamper off and he looks at you three and he says,
Principal Hawthorne: You three, tell me—
Justin: [laughing] Oh oh! Did they get to the infirmary? ‘Cause they got hit for twenty points of damage.
[Audience laughter]
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: And they’re kids?
Griffin: Yeah, I think they probably do, they run off to the nurse’s office to get seen to. Um, Principal Hawthorne says,
Principal Hawthorne: You three.
Magnus: Yes, sir.
Principal Hawthorne: Were you bullying those sweet boys?
Magnus: No, sir, uh we came up on them fighting each other and we tried to break them up—
Taako: No, Mag— Magnus sucker punched them, sir. For sure.
[Audience clapping, cheering]
Merle: We saw the whole thing! [crosstalk]
Taako: [crosstalk] Wait, wait, wait—
Magnus: [crosstalk] What we meant to say was, we caught them smoking cigarettes and I said, no! Not today! Not here, not in my school, sir!
Griffin: He says,
Principal Hawthorne: I do smell cigarettes. Magnus, let me smell your fingers. [threateningly]
Magnus: Well! Okay!
Merle: ’Scuse me?!
Magnus: Also gross but also, okay.
Griffin: He sniffs and he says,
Principal Hawthorne: These are nicotine free. You’re good to go.
[Audience laughter]
Magnus: Hi five, sir!
Griffin: He says,
Principal Hawthorne: You three get to class.
Travis: Oookay?
Principal Hawthorne: You’re late enough as is.
Griffin: And he turns, and with a swoop of his robe he turns and walks away.
Clint: Were we supposed to have known who that was?
Travis: Was it Nathaniel Hawthorne?
Griffin: Yeah, it was Nathaniel Hawthorne.
[Audience laughter]
Travis: Damn, now I wish I had punched him! [Griffin and audience laugh] I hate that idiot!
Griffin: So! The three of you make your way down the hallway and each approach a different classroom, that for some reason you just know is your first period class. And for this next part, I didn’t prep anything, I just let each of you decide what your first period class was gonna be? And… it will affect sort of a later thing? But, uh, let’s just feel out the space a little bit. Uhm, uh we’ll start with… we’ll start with, uhhh… Magnus. What class do you have for—
Travis: Music Appreciation.
[Audience whoops and cheers]
Griffin: You walk into Music Appreciation class. Ummmmm… uhhhhhh…
Travis: [laughing] So far so good with the role in this!
[awkward laughter from Griffin]
Griffin: Mr. Joe is the teacher. Thank you Joe. Uh.
[Audience cheering]
Justin: [dramatically] Arrive with spell cards, leave with immortality.
[Audience laughter]
Griffin: Uh, and it’s– it’s finals day here in music appreciation class. Surveying the room… surveying the room, you don't really recognize anybody here? Uh except for, in like the far back corner, is a high school aged Carey and Killian!
Travis: Yeaaaaaah!
[Audience cheering and applauding]
Travis: I— I post up with those fools.
Griffin: Yeah. You’re doing what?
Travis: I post up with them?
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I go sit where they are?
Griffin: Uhhh yeah I think the three of you just spend time passing, passing notes? During the class?
Magnus: Uhhh real quick before we, uh, it’s real cute, um before we get started, uhhhh… [voice goes higher] do you guys notice anything weird?
Griffin: Uhhh, Carey says, uh…
Carey: No? Nothing weird?
Griffin: This sounds like Brody, is the problem, I did Carey’s voice for Brody. She says—
Carey: No, what’s going on Magnus?
Magnus: Well, um, like yesterday? We were all like, of legal drinking age.
[Audience laughter]
Magnus: At least. I’m not going to assume, I— I’ve never asked? You? But I thought, older than high school?
Griffin: Uh… Killian says,
Killian: I don’t know how to even respond to that, are you—
Magnus: Fair enough.
Killian: Hey, are you on party drugs right now?
[Audience laughter]
Travis: Do I need to roll to check that?
Griffin: Oh no, you’re not on party drugs.
Travis: Okay! We’ll just [crosstalk] let the DM make decisions for my character, I guess!
Griffin: Mr. Joe— Mr. Joe at the front of the class is like,
Mr. Joe: You three! Keep it down! Magnus?
Magnus: Yep?
Mr. Joe: It’s your turn for your oral presentation.
[Audience laughter]
Justin: Ahaha! Nice.
Mr. Joe: Magnus?
Magnus: Yes?
Mr. Joe: For your final I have your song written down here that you have written a report about. [faint audience laughter]
Clint: Oooohhhhh goooooooood [continued laughing]
Mr. Joe: It says here…
Magnus: Yes?
Mr. Joe: I’ve never heard this before, and I teach music. Professionally. The name of the band is inappropriate. [Pause] Because it says ‘Barenaked Ladies.’
[Audience cheering and applauding]
Magnus: Yes, sir?
Mr. Joe: The song is ‘One Week’ by ‘BareNaked Ladies.’
[Audience cheers even louder]
Travis: Ahem-hem-hem.
Justin: Wait, you gotta button?
Griffin: No, I don’t have that on the board. I didn’t know he was gonna fucking— No.
Travis: And where— where would you— [crosstalk]
Griffin: Hang on wait. Can everyone just sing a few bars of ‘BareNaked Ladies’ ‘One Week’?
{26:28}
Travis: [singing] It’s been one week since you looked at me…
[audience continuing the song from where Travis left off, quickly comes to a stop]
Travis: [indistinguishable singing]
Griffin: Nobody knows the words. [slight pause] Oh, they do know the— all of the words.
Justin: Let’s pick it up from [crosstalk] ‘Chickity China’...
Travis: Wait, we’ll start at the good part. [starts singing] Chickity China the Chinese Chicken You have a drumstick and your...
Travis & Justin: ...brain stops tickin,’ watchin’ X-Files with no lights on, we’re dans la maison I hope the Smoking Man’s in this one; like Harrison Ford I’m getting frantic, like Sting I’m tantric...
Griffin: [singing continues in the background] Now we can’t release this.
Travis & Justin: Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy...
Griffin: It’s not fair use. This is not a parody. This is just the song.
Travis & Justin: Like Kurosawa I make mad films, ‘kay, I don’t make films, or if I did they’d have a samurai. [indistinguishable sounds to fill in lyrics they don’t remember] always flying off the backswing. Get in tune with Sailor Moon ‘cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes that make me think the wrong thing. How can I help it, if I think it's funny when you’re mad? Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad. I’m the kind of guy that laughs at a funeral; can’t understand what I mean? Well you soon will...
Griffin: Holy shit, guys??
Travis & Justin: I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve, I have an history of taking off my shirt...
Griffin: Alright—
Travis: It’s been one week since you looked at me… [stops singing]
[audience cheering]
Justin: That was good.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: The theme from F•R•I•E•N•D•S, ladies and gentlemen.
[Griffin laughing]
Clint: Right? Was that right?
Griffin: Hold on. Hold on. One second.
Clint: ‘Kay.
[‘Yeah Baby’ Clint voice clip plays]
[Clint laughter and audience laughter/cheering]
Travis: And just like that— [crosstalk]
Griffin: This is a good present— [crosstalk]
Travis: Birthday present—
Griffin: Thank you, Travis, for this good present. Alright, so… appreciate for [stumbles] Dr. Joe now. He just graduated.
[Travis laughing]
Griffin: Sitting at his desk—
Travis: My— my rendition of ‘One Week’ was that good?
Dr. Joe: Appreciate for me. Appreciate it. Appreciate.
[audience laughter]
Magnus: Well, sir, here’s the thing. The song at first seems like a superficial recount of things that one might do during one week, but if you look at it on a deeper level, what it really establishes is the the time it takes to fully appreciate your partner. Because you might look at it and say ‘you know what in that moment, I acted badly, but now one week later, it's given me time to think about what you mean to me, what I come across in this relationship. Only now, one week later do I fully appreciate that I didn’t appreciate you.’ And that's the juxtaposition that you get, sir.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: He—
Justin: I’m— I’m gonna have to—
Griffin: He stares at you for a second. And he just bursts into tears.
Justin: Also, I’m just gonna assume that's what Magnus sounded like in high school.
Travis: Yeaahh… Well, my voice broke at the beginning. [chuckles]
Justin: Okay.
Clint: Are you on him about character voices now?
Travis: Well, I didn’t alter my voice the 2% that turns it into Magnus.
Griffin: Joe— Joe, where are you, Joe? [pause] A through F, what would you give that class presentation?
[Joe responds from audience]
Griffin: B plus. Alright.
Travis: Nice! [crosstalk]
Travis: I take it!
Justin: Nice. Nice.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Magnus, take one point of inspiration that you can spend later this episode.
Travis: [crosstalk] Hell yeah.
Griffin: Uhhhhh… Merle.
Clint: Hmm?
Griffin: What class do you have?
Clint: Um… Botany!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Ummmmm…
Clint: And I want Barry White music for mine.
Griffin: What’s your name on the left side of this row, in the front. Yes, you.
[response from female audience member]
Griffin: Ariel? Okay. Um, uh, Ms. Ariel is the teacher of this class. And, you scan the room and you kinda look around to see if you see any familiar faces and the only one that you see, in the front of the class, is Lucretia. Um—
[audience cheers]
Griffin: And, uhhhh, she has a potted plant in front of her, everybody has these potted plants, and you’re— you’re kinda late. Uh, and you recognize your potted plant kinda sitting next to Lucretia. She’s working on a nice orchid, and these are your final presentations. And, uh, Ms. Ariel walks up to you as you come up to your seat and she says:
Ms. Ariel: You’re late, Merle.
Griffin: [to Ariel in the audience] That’s not what you sound like, I apologize.
Ms. Ariel: You’re late, Merle. You know you have to turn in your flower by the end of the day.
Merle: Yes, yes, I know.
Griffin: What are you growing, in this class?
Merle: I am growing a shrubbery.
Justin: Let’s try it again. Try it again.
Merle: I am growing—
Clint: Wait, I gotta do a high school version—
Travis: A high school old man.
Justin: Yeah, motherfucker. Anything’ll do.
Clint: [away from mic] Okay.
Justin: Cut me off a piece of whatever, as long as it doesn’t sound like my father.
Travis: [crosstalk] Come on, funniest man in Huntington, stick the landing.
Clint: Alright, Alright.
Merle: [high-pitched old man voice] Uh, yeah.
[audience cheers]
Travis: That was it. That was it.
Griffin: Okay.
Merle: I, uh, I been workin’ on a shrubbery. And it’s really cool.
Ms. Ariel: Actually, it looks sick and bad and it doesn't look good. It looks sick and bad.
Merle: No, no. Its one of those Japanese shrubberies that you trim to look sick and bad. It’s really healthy, because I dump fertilizer on it every day.
Griffin: Uh, you can talk some game, but your shrubbery looks bad, and it’s gonna look bad when you turn it in unless you do some magic or whatever to it to make it look better to turn in.
Travis: Don’t say ‘or whatever,’ 'cause it's gonna be ‘or whatever.’
Merle: Well, I’m a big believer in talking to my plants.
Justin: Fuck you, I quit.
[audience laughter]
Justin: I’m out. Is Taako in the building? Taako has left the building. Taako’s smoking with the cool kids.
Griffin: Lucretia looks over at your shrubbery and she says:
Lucretia: I don't know, Merle. It looks pretty bad off. I’m worried about the grade you’re gonna get on this one.
Merle: Trust me.
Griffin: Okay.
Merle: I can do this.
Clint: Oh, god, now?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Yes.
[audience laughter as Clint transforms his Gatorade bottle into a plant]
Clint: Wait a minute...
Justin (muffled): I’m here. [crosstalk]
Griffin: Is that supposed to look— be a plant now? ‘Cause, uh, okay.
Travis: Yeah, dad has turned, uh, for those of you at home—
Justin: [crosstalk] Your human sons are in the room, your actual human sons.
Travis: Yes, please, my dad has turned his Gatorade bottle into a plant.
Justin: You're still Clint McElroy. When you walk on the stage please, please be cognizant of that.
Travis: And don’t fuck this plant.
Clint: This would be—
Merle: [softly] Hi.
Justin (muffled): No.
[Griffin chuckles]
Justin (muffled): No. Stop.
Griffin: He’s— sorry, sorry, for the audience at home, [uncomfortably close to the mic] he’s fondling the plant.
Merle: Y’know, uh, I’ve been nurturing you for a long time.
[Travis walks backstage]
Justin: Hey, my— hey Trav, get me one? Will you get me one too? [crosstalk] I needed another gi— whiskey and ginger ale if anybody could hook a Justin up for this.
Merle: Nobody really understands our relationship. Y’know—
[Justin joins Travis off stage]
Clint: [distantly] The hell?
Griffin: I’m still here. [laughs] Hey, dad—
Clint: [crosstalk] You’re a freak. You are a little freak.
Griffin: Hey dad, I’m lovin’ this.
Merle: I, uh, y’know I believe in you. You have strong roots.
Griffin: It’s starting— it’s starting to grow a few leeeeeeeaves.
Merle: And someday, you’ll tower above all the other shrubs. And you’re going to [pause] blossom... into fullness.
Clint: Tell me when they get back so I can really be—
Griffin: You can see them.
Clint: Oh.
Merle: And ripeness.
Griffin: Alright!
Merle: And your sap… [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] [distant] You’re all complicit!
Merle: Your sap shall runneth. Your sap overrunneth.
Griffin: Alright, that’s good.
Justin: You’re complicit!
Clint: [crosstalk] Now wait a minute I’m on a roll!
Justin: [crosstalk] You’re all complicit!
Clint: I’m rolling!
Griffin: Alright, uhhh…
Justin: Bad people win when good people sit by and say nothing!
Griffin: The, uh, the plant grows and blooms and blossoms and is... fine...
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Uh, Ariel, what was the grade on that one?
[response from Ariel]
Griffin: That’s a D!
[audience cheering]
Justin: That’s short for ‘don’t.’
Griffin: D is actually, uh…
Clint: Uh, no, no, no. I think she said B.
Griffin: [rising in pitch] No, I’m pretty sure it was a D for dog.
Clint: You people who seemed to like me more who are sitting near Ariel—
Griffin: Nope, nope. No judging— you, uh, you’re gonna take disadvantage later, at a moment of my choosing. We gotta keep moving. Mer— or, ah, Taako. What is your class?
Justin: Whoa, I just wanna say real quick, that is quite a strong drink you’ve prepared for me, so if things get weird later, blame Travis.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Taako.
Justin: Hit me!
Griffin: No, you hit me. What class do you have?
Justin: [high-pitched] Home-Ec, baby!
Griffin: Okay.
[Audience Cheering]
Griffin: Yeah. [Justin and Travis laugh] All right. [crosstalk] What's your name? [answer from audience] Rick?
Clint: Rick, you’re an enabler.
Griffin: Mr. Ricky is the teacher of home economics.
[Audience Cheering]
Travis: Mr. Rick does sound like the name of the cool teacher that's like, ‘nah please call me Mr. Rick.’
Griffin: Uh Mr. Ricky— [crosstalk]
Justin: ‘Here's some booze I brought you—’
[all laugh]
Clint: ‘Don't tell Mr. Hawthorne—’
Justin: ‘Yeah, you know how he gets.’
[Rick from the audience: ""I actually am a teacher!”]
Griffin: Oh, he is a teacher—
Justin: Rick is a teacher!
Two boys: Yaaaay!
Travis: You know what, teachers don't get enough applause—
Justin: Yeah.
[Continuous audience cheering]
Griffin: Yeah! Hey, let's clap for teachers!
Clint: YEAH!
Justin: And how about moms?
Griffin: Eyyy… and what about FUCKING FIREFIGHTERS? YEAH!
Clint: And let’s end all war!
Justin: Yeah!
Griffin: Whoa!
Travis: And let's hear it for podcasters!
Griffin: Okay, well, that’s— you've ruined all of it.
[applause and cheering stop]
Travis: [crosstalk] (says something)
Justin: [crosstalk] Is there something you can say about horns that will make them excited now?
Griffin: About—
Justin: About hooking horns, or—?
Griffin: Oh, hook ‘em horns—
Justin: Is that here? You do the thing with the—
Griffin: I don't think this is the right crrrroooowd for that though.
Travis: Boomer Sooner?
Clint: Who?
[Audience boos]
Griffin: Jesus Christ, Travis.
Justin: Okay, please, this is my special part, guys.
Griffin: Uh, Taako, you recognize Ren in this class—
Justin: Hell yeah!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: And she's actually saved you a seat, and she gets really excited when you come in— she says—
Ren: Taako, Taako! I saved you a seat right here c’mon c’mon c’mon!
Taako: There she is. What's up?
Griffin: Mr. Rick walks up to the front of the class and he says— and Rick, I apologize.
[audience laughter]
Clint: Wait, can I give a little background music?
Griffin: Oh, I actually— oh SHIT I had background music for all of these and I forgot them.
Clint: Aww, excellent.
Justin: Sorry, dad.
[pause]
Griffin: Wait, why is—
[Persona 4 - Like A Dream Come True begins to play]
Clint: That's really good.
Griffin: Uh—
[audience cheers]
Griffin: You walk into the class and see Ren and sit next to her, and Mr. Rick walks up to the front of the class and says:
Mr. Rick: Alright, y’all know the deal. We’re making ham sandwiches again.
Griffin: He says:
Mr. Rick: Nobody try anything funny, don't add anything weird or fancy to ‘em. I just want everybody to turn in their regular [Clint cracks up] ham sandwiches at the end of the class. Nobody better lead some kinda food revolution, [audience laughter] here in this class. I just want a plain-ass— plain-ass ham sandwich— don't tell on me I said ‘ass’ to you kids.
[audience laughter]
Clint: Mr. Rick has been teaching for a very long time, [crosstalk] hasn't he.
Griffin: [crosstalk] He has— He says:
Mr. Rick: You got ffi— it’s just ten minutes. It's a ham sandwich, just do it. Uhhh, and again, nobody better do anything fancy or lead some sort of... Footloose-style... culinary uprising against me, all right.
Griffin: Taako, you and Ren are partners on this project. What do you make?
Justin: Wait, I'm partners with— did you say Rick, or Ren?
Griffin: Ren.
Justin: Uuuuummmmm, we’re making croque-monsieur.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: You're making croque-monsieur and the whole time Ren is lik
Ren: Are you sure— this isn't what he asked for. This is—
Taako: Well, uh, why don't you pass the nutmeg and the gruyère and we can talk about it later.
Griffin: Did you load up a recipe?
Justin: What?
Griffin: Did you load up a recipe—
Clint: Hell yes, he did.
Justin: Hell yeah, I did. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: Tell me what you do with this.
Justin: I, uhm—
Griffin (softly): Walk me through it.
Justin: Okay, well. We're gonna preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Griffin: Okay, not that granular. [audience cheers] Okay, you turn in—
Justin: I mean I make it. What do you want, PERVERT?
[audience laughter]
Griffin: You turn in your fancy ham sandwich.
Justin: It’s croque-monsieur.
Griffin: And Mr. Rick says:}}
Mr. Rick: What do you think you're doin’? Take this back. I want a regular ham sandwich. That's what I asked for. You trying to get an F?
Taako: If F stands for fantastic croque-monsieur, then yes.
[audience cheers]
Taako: Hey, Rick—
Griffin: A few of the—
Taako: Hey, Rick.
Mr. Rick: Yeah?
Taako: [flirty] Take a bite, Rick.
[audience cheers]
Mr. Rick: I'm not going to take a bite of th—
Taako: RIIICK—
Mr. Rick: It's a weird looking ham sandwich—
Taako: RIIIICK. RIICK.
Griffin: Some like other students in the class are standing up and just saying like
Students: Take a BITE, RICK!
[audience cheers]
Taako: Take a—
Clint: TAKE a BITE, RICK!
Clint and Travis: TAKE A BITE, RICK!
All, chanting: TAKE A BITE, RICK! TAKE A BITE, RICK!!
Griffin: Okay, thank you. He says,
Mr. Rick: Fine. God I just— every class I get bullied by kids. Bullied by kids into doing things.
Griffin: He takes a bite of your fancy ham sandwich and he says…
[pause]
Clint: D.
Griffin: I think his, like, his, like, uh— he just runs out classroom, sort of crying, and his pants fall down while he's going. [audience laughter] And suddenly like all the students are just like up on their desks Matilda-style, cheering you and Ren on. [audience cheers] Uh, you— the— you don't get a grade traditionally from Rick because he ran away and his pants fell down but— again, sorry, real Rick— uh, but the rest of the students get together and give you an A for the class. [audience cheers] And A stands for auto— aut—
Justin: [crosstalk] Advantage?
Griffin: Auto 20.
Justin: Awww, yeah.
Griffin: So at any point when you're about to roll you can just take a crit instead.
[audience laughter]
Justin: You do— are you sure you want to give that to me?
Clint: Awww.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: All right.
Griffin: All right, let's get into it. The three of you have fourth period together. You make your way out of the classroom building and over to the campus’s massive gymnasium for P.E.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: This facility is massive. The main gymnasium room has side chambers for locker rooms and a coach's office and a concession stand with a long open service window. The west and east walls are lined with bleachers that are like folded in right now, they’re not deployed bleachers-style. And they’re stacked 15 feet high, leaving more room for sports to happen. [audience giggling]
I wrote that. [audience laughter] Hanging from the ceiling are two basketball hoops on either end of the floor. And uhhh, uhhh uh... I wrote ‘and backboards’ like yeah, of course. [audience laughter] Below you the hardwood floor is slick and polished, you can barely see the seam in the middle of the floor where it opens up to reveal the Olympic sized pool underneath.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Yeah, It’s a Wonderful Life like a motherfucker.
[audience laughter]
Griffin: Sorry?
Justin: It's a Wonderful Life? [crosstalk] The dancing contest—
Griffin: Oh yeah yea—
Justin: It opens up—
Clint: It's all right, [crosstalk] 15 people in the audience got it—
Griffin: No, no, I get it, just traditionally you don't hear the words ‘it's a wonderful life,' like—
Griffin and Travis: '—a motherfucker.’
[audience laughter]
[Clint laughs]
[crosstalk]
Justin: Sydnee really likes that movie, so we watched it—
Griffin: Yeah, it's a good one.
Justin: For the holiday—
Griffin: So there's some familiar face—
Justin: Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight.
Griffin: Jesus.
Clint: Jimmy Stewart.
Justin: Yeeaahh.
Clint: Donna Reed.
Justin: Donna Reed!
Griffin: Hell yeah, who else was in this film?
[audience laughter]
Griffin: So, there are some familiar faces in this classroom and you see them after everybody changes into their athletic attire and lines up on half court. Angus is there, he's in the lineup, next to you. So are Carey and Killian. Down the line a bit is Brody who inexplicably is still on his skateboard. [audience laughter] At the far end, all goofing on each other and just endlessly combing their hair are the Hammerheads. Suddenly the coach's office door opens and slams shut and a serious-faced human man walks toward the lot of you. And Angus kinda sees that you're having trouble remembering who this person is so he whispers his name discreetly to the three of you. He says,
Angus: Oh, that’s Coach Derek Taylor.
[music plays] [audience cheers]
Griffin: And Coach Derek Taylor walks forward—
Clint: [crosstalk] Coooooach Derek Taylor!!
Griffin: Sorry, I thought this Friday Night Lights reference would get more of a—
[audience cheers]
Travis: I’m more of a Saturday Night Lights kind of person.
Griffin: Coach Derek Taylor walks forward and gives you all a very inspiring speech.
Travis: Do it now.
Clint: Come on, do it! Give us the speech!
Griffin: He says,
Coach Derek Taylor: It’s come to my attention that there are some folks in this class that think P.E. is a big, dumb waste of time.
[laughter, one person audibly booing]
Coach Taylor: I’ll be the first to admit that P.E. isn’t as sexy as algebra or world history. But when you graduate you’ll look back on the lessons you learned in this class as some of the most valuable of your high school career. Lessons like accountability, leadership, how to catch a ball or throw a ball very fast at a teammate or some sort of goal. You don’t have to savor every moment of this class, but here in my gym you will show myself, and each other, some respect. Clear eyes, full sports, have fun!
[audience cheers, Travis laughing]
Travis: That’s good.
Coach Taylor: Today we’re continuing our 3-on-3 basketball tournament. Looks like our first match-up is the Hammerheads verses Tres— I’m not gonna say that.
Griffin: He looks at the three of you and he says,
Coach Taylor: Next time, you guys need to pick a different team name. I’m not gonna say that.
Justin: Uh, I cast Blur and Enhance Ability: Cat’s Grace.
[‘hell yeah’ can be heard from audience]
Griffin: Okay, what’s that do?
Justin: Blur— my body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering, to all who can see me for the duration. Any creatures have disadvantage for any attack rolls made against me, translate that into basketball. And then I get Cat’s Grace.
Griffin: What’s that?
Justin: Y’know, it’s like, good at basketball.
[Griffin and audience laughing]
Griffin: Fucking Gary Gygax hunched over his desk like, ‘we need a basketball spell.’
[audience laughing]
Griffin: Coach Derek Taylor says, like:
Coach Taylor: Hey, you didn’t just cast a bunch of magic on yourself to make yourself better at basketball like the Monstars, did ya? Hey, Taako. Hey, Taako—
Taako: [crosstalk] Yeah?
Coach Taylor: You didn’t just cast a whole bunch of spells on yourself to make yourself better like the Monstars—
Justin: I look down on him ‘cause I cast Alter Self to be taller too. We’ve come this far without using magic, I figured I could burn a few slots.
Griffin: All right, yeah. Uh, all right. The three of you take your basketball positions and Coach Derek Taylor holds out a basketball at center court. Marvey takes position for the jump, while he’s got still kind of a black eye situation from earlier. Who’s going to take the jump ball for Tres Horny Boys?
Travis: Well, Taako’s very tall now, sooo…
Clint: [crosstalk] I’ll do it!
Travis: It’s Taako.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Yeah, Merle does it.
Griffin: Alright, Merle—
Clint: I do it!
Griffin: Merle, roll an athletics check.
Travis: I stand behind Merle and throw him up in the air.
Griffin: No, no, no—
Travis: Globetrotters style!
Griffin: [crosstalk] We do— no, that’s not how the Globe—
Travis: GLOBE! TROTTERS! STYLE!
Justin: You know how the Globetrotters have always thrown each other around?
Clint: I throw a bucket of confetti at everybody!
Travis: Rip Taylor style!
Justin: I have, uh advantage on dexterity checks, that’s Cat’s Grace.
Griffin: Okay, okay. Uh, athletics—
Travis: 8, so that’s an 8 total.
Griffin: Okay, uh, Marvey jumps up and just, fucking posterizes you as he secures the ball for his team—
Travis: I karate chop his legs as he comes down.
Justin: That’s definitely a technical foul.
Griffin: Yeah you can do that but is — hey guys?! It’s basketball, a little bit, kind of, sometimes?
Clint: I will explain—
Travis: Okay I won’t karate chop his legs, but I will like—
Griffin: Cover him?
Travis: Check him? Yes.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Wait is this hockey?
Griffin: No!
Clint: The irony of us playing a basketball game-game should not be lost on you.
Griffin: We used to have a basketball hoop in our backyard, we know—
Justin: And we were all right at it—
Clint: Then take the net down, make it about 8 feet high.
Griffin: That is true.
Justin: My dad used to organise this thing on Wednesdays and Saturdays after we did all our chores, called Whoops Fest, it was w-h-o-o-p-s, and it was a combination uh, of basketball and Doctor Who day. Where we would—
[audience cheering]
Justin: Think about it, it makes sense where if we did all our chores we got to watch Doctor Who and play basketball.
Griffin: Um.
Travis: And that’s how we’re the well balanced children we are today.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah. Uh, Magnus. Sounds like you’re covering Marvey. He’s trying to pass it— he’s trying to pass it to Jerreeeeee, make a… make an athletics check.
[sound of dice rolling]
Travis: Nope.
Clint: Whoa!
Travis: What’s inspiration do?
Griffin: Uh, gives you advantage so you can roll again.
Travis: I’m gonna take that here 'cause that was a one. [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] That was a one!
[sound of dice rolling]
Travis: Oh yeah, that was an 18—
Griffin: Okay you get it.
Travis: —plus… 8, 26.
Griffin: You steal— you steal the ball from Marvey and now you have what’s called possession of the basketball.
Travis: Um, I would like to juke around said Marvey.
Griffin: Okay, uh, this was a maneuver. You will also roll plus athletics for this.
Travis: That’s a 20.
[audience cheering]
Griffin: Yeah. Alright, you get around him and you break away so you are not covered at all if you want to go for a shot.
Travis: I wanna go for two!
Clint: [sarcastic] Oh, what a surprise!
Griffin: Make a dexterity roll as you shoot the ball at the hoop.
Travis: That’s a 17 plus 2.
Griffin: That’s 2 points for Tres Horny Boys! Swish!
[audience cheering and clapping]
Griffin: Little Jerry takes the ball and is gonna try to pass it to Marvey. Merle or Taako, you wanna get in on this or are you trying to look for a spell to cast at this basketball game?
Clint: I cast—
Griffin: Holy shit.
Clint: —Lycanthropy and turn myself into a Teen Wolf!
Travis: Yeah!
[audience cheering]
Clint: Yeah!
Travis: Now—
Clint: Shut up Travis, shut up Travis!
Travis: B-b-before we celebrate too much Dad, I have to ask; [high pitched] do you have Lycanthropy?
Griffin: That’s not even a fucking spell—
Clint: [mocking] I don’t know because I don’t have any spell cards! Tell him, Lycanthropy’s a real spell!
Griffin: It’s super fucking not!
[more cheering]
Griffin: You can cast, like, Disguise Self to look like a werewolf.
Justin: 'Cause here’s what happens. I’m gonna settle this, uh, he cast Disguise Self to look like a werewolf but he continues to play with the ability of Merle so h— [wheeze laughter] he’s— he’s like a werewolf that plays basketball as good as dad.
Griffin: That’s good, you’ve disguised yourself to look like a werewolf—
Clint: I will accept that compromise!
Griffin: Uh, we’re gonna make a, uh, a contest against each other with athletics you— to the number you just rolled. You roll your 20-sided dice, please Christ in Heaven don’t do this to me every time. I rolled a 2.
Travis: Huh, I rolled a 4—
Clint: I rolled a 4!
Griffin: Okay you steal the ball from—
Clint: Yeah!
[audience cheering]
Griffin: Uh, you’re right up against it but now you are covered, uh, by Jerreeeeee. So you can take a shot but you’re gonna have disadvantage or you can give it to one of your teammates.
Clint: I’m gonna [garbled words] it looks to me like Taako is open, and—
Travis: Is that accurate?
Griffin: By the way, by the way, by the way, before this play starts, you hear the same bell and it chimes 3 times.
Clint: What? What bell?
Griffin: From the beginning. I forgot to do the rest of the bells, we’re at 3 bells.
[audience laughing]
Griffin: Oops~! [giggles]
Clint: 3 bells? What are you, Popeye the Sailor?
Justin: Has that been going down every time?
Griffin: [seriously] Yes. That’s the— that’s the weird thing is if I had been doing ‘em, they’d have been going down this whole time.
[audience cheering]
Griffin: Can you imagine if, like, the whole time the bells have been going down in number—
Travis: Oh man.
Griffin: And you’re like, ‘Woah! What?!’
Clint: Dong! Oh yeah, that would have built some serious tension.
Griffin: Right. But imagine, and now it’s at 3, oh no!
Travis: [laughing]
Justin: That’s so much worse than 4, which would have happened a few minutes ago!
Griffin: Merle, what are you doing? We’ve been going an hour.
Clint: Well I, uh, uh, the 3 bells threw me off! Um, I notice that because Taako is so beloved and well regarded that he’s not—
Travis: He’s yelling.
Clint: Well I have to, to be heard over you guys.
Travis: Fair enough.
Clint: He, uh, he— I pass it to Taako because he’s free and clear and driving toward— as the only one of the 4 of us who's ever actually seen a basketball game, I pass it to Taako because he’s driving on the— on the basket.
Griffin: Alright, make a—
Justin: And I throw it into the hole.
Griffin: Hold on! Roll your pass, roll plus dex.
Clint: Roll plus dex.
Griffin: Dexterity.
Travis: Roll the— roll—
Griffin: It’s a 0, I’ll make it easy for you, it’s a 0.
Clint: Yeah but that’s a 19!
Griffin: Alright, you get it to Taako.
Justin: I cast Levitate and I dunk it!
[audience cheering]
Griffin: Alright.
Clint: Surely you’ve got music for this, Griffin! You have to have music, something from Space Jam!
Justin: Yeah, you have dunk music?
[Space Jam Theme Song plays]
[audience cheering]
Griffin: Oh, wait, roll athletics Taako!
Travis: Crit 20!
Griffin: [crosstalk] It really did, it was a crit 20.
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh, here he goes!
Griffin: He’s gonna fucking sprint off the stage.
Travis: Crit 20...
Justin: I— y’know what, that was a crit 20! I’m gonna need it again, Griffin!
Griffin: Oh, you wanna hear the—?
Clint: Yeah, yeah.
[Space Jam Theme Song resumes]
Travis: Yeah!
Griffin: It does double damage, it does double Space Jam. Okay, um, yeah all right, that’s, that’s another good 2 points up on the board. Uh, the bell chimes 2 times.
Justin: [through laughter] I don’t care!
Clint: What, what is this bell?
Griffin: When the bell chimes 2 times you see Principal Hawthorne come in the room and start talking with Coach Derek Taylor about something. Um, and Little Jerry’s got the ball and he’s gonna pass it to Marvey, and Marvey is running down the, the basketball lane, getting ready to score points [crosstalk] for their team.
Travis: [crosstalk] I block him.
Griffin: Okay, uh, roll athletics.
Travis: Nope!
Griffin: Alright, he gets right by ya.
Clint: Another 1, we wanna keep track of all these.
Travis: That’s a crit 1, thanks new dice.
Griffin: Marvey throws up a 3, gets a 21, that’s 3 points. 3 to 4—
Travis: Oh I was so confused 'cause I thought you threw up a 3 and got 21 points.
[audience laughing]
Griffin: Who’s, uh, who's gonna take the ball in for your team?
Justin: I’m gonna cast Clairvoyance over where the two of them are talking.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Uh, so I have a spell, like, I can hear the shit they’re saying.
Griffin: Okay. And fuckin’ Principal—
Travis: I got the ball.
Griffin: —Hawthorne’s like,
Principal Hawthorne: Did you see Scandal last night?
Travis: I grab the ball.
Griffin: And Coach Derek Taylor’s like,
Coach Derek Taylor: Aw nah, my DVR fucked up again.
[audience laughing]
Coach Derek Taylor: Clear eyes, full sports, have fun.
Griffin: Uh, okay!
Travis: I pa— I have the ball.
Griffin: Yes?
Travis: I’d like to pass it to Merle.
Griffin: All right, you’re actually being, at this point, you’re being covered by Marvey and he’s like,
Maarvey: Oh gonna pass? Aw, such a tough guy.
Travis: I hit him with my butt real hard and knock him out of the way.
Griffin: Okay, roll, uh, roll a butt attack.
Travis: Uh, is that strength?
Griffin: Yeah~.
Travis: So that’s a 15.
Griffin: Uh, okay yeah, you butt attack him out of the way.
Travis: I pass to Merle.
Griffin: Okay. You roll a dex for a pass to Merle.
Travis: Oh no, god these suck! [singsong?] Uhhh ummm, that’s not it. Hit my can...that’s a 6 total.
[Griffin laughs]
Griffin: With a 6 you, like, overarm throw it to Merle and it just goes up and it gets stuck in the rafters.
[audience laughing]
Griffin: The play stops for a little bit while they try to find a new ball and Merle calls the three of you over— er, Merle, Jesus. Uh, Angus calls the three of you over, he’s standing over by the bleachers and he’s like,
Angus: Hey! Come here, come here, come here.
Griffin: And he’s got one, he’s got one of those big books you saw him with, and he says um,
Angus: I— I think I figured out what’s going on. What this is is not just a dream you all are having, it’s a— it’s a Dreamscape! That’s, uh, it’s like kind of a type of magic and somebody usually makes it. And I guess what is bad is, like, usually when you’re in a Dreamscape, somebody brings you there to, like, usually just to like test you or something and see how you respond in like a, some sort of crisis scenario.
Clint: Well as long as Ariel’s not grading we oughta be alright.
Griffin: Geez, still gonna hold that against her? Uh, and as he says that, the bell chimes one and all hell breaks loose. Pretty much literally. For a moment you think that the mechanisms in the floor below you have activated, opening up the pool below but what really happens is just a shock tears through the room and you see this purple pulsating rift torn open in the centre of the gym floor sending these bright fissures out in all directions. And from those fissures, these gnarled hands start to punch up and claw their way upward.
Griffin: The next few seconds are full of just, like, panicked running and screaming from all the students in the room, as a horde of shambling zombies rise up from the floor and begin pursuing the zom— pursuing the students around the gym. And you hear shouts coming from all around, you hear student— you hear one student yell,
Student: The doors are locked! We’re trapped!
Griffin: And sure enough, students are banging at the one exit, back out onto the quad but you can see it’s sealed by some sort of magic force. And so some of the students are just, like, scrambling up the wall of bleachers to get to safety. You see some rushing into one of the locker rooms and Coach Derek Taylor’s there just ushering them all into safety. This scene is chaos but you see Carey and Killian making their way into that locker room where most of the students are going to and motioning to the three of you wildly to follow them—
Travis: I motion back, no—
Killian: No, you come in here to the locker room!
Magnus: No listen, this is gonna be great! We haven’t fought zombies yet, I’m very excited!
Griffin: They say,
Killian: Please come to the locker room, you don’t have any stuff!
Griffin: You don’t have any weapons or gear to speak of.
Justin: I have been in the locker room for 3 minutes, just—
[Clint laughing]
Griffin: The three of you are in the locker room, I’m gonna go turbo mode because we’ve been going for 67 minutes. And a wave of undead pursue you close behind but Coach Derek slams the door as soon as the three of you clear it and barricades it with a few containers nearby. Most of the student—
Travis: Describe the containers.
[Griffin clicks his tongue]
Griffin: They’re metal. Most of the students made it in here and they’re all just kinda nervously milling about and there’s a narrow window in the door and through it you see the zombies just, like, pushing against the door all moaning in unison. And across the way on top of that—
Travis: Wait hold on, [to audience] moan in unison.
[audience moans in unison]
Griffin: Very spooky.
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: And across the way on top of the stacked up bleachers you see a few unfortunate souls who didn’t make it to the relative safety of the locker room. The Hammerheads all ended up there, as did Principal Hawthorne. Brody is up there—
Travis: No!
Griffin: He’s still on his skateboard. You recognise one more student up there too, standing on the bleachers nervously clutching his book is Angus McDonald.
[audience screaming]
Griffin: They seem to be safe for now, 15 feet up a sheer wall of bleachers but the undead are clamoring at the bleachers, trying to pile up—
Clint: Aww, that’s too bad. That’s really too bad.
Griffin: Coach Taylor says— you hear Coach Taylor say,
Coach Taylor: Aw shit, shit shit! I’m gonna lose my job, I have to start over at a new school with a new team of kids whose lives I’m gonna have to transform all over again—
Magnus: Hey! You listen to me! That’s not how seniority works, good luck!
Griffin: Uh, he turns to the class and he says,
Coach Taylor: Okay, new assignment; anyone who wants to prove their physical fitness by getting out there and killing all those monsters gets an A in this class for the whole semester. Who’s game?
[audience cheering]
Griffin: And, uh, Killian walks up and says,
Killian: How about the whole year, not just the whole semester.
Griffin: And he says,
Coach Taylor: Okay fine, fine, the whole year!
Magnus: Yeah! High five!
Coach Taylor: Anybody else, any takers?!
Magnus: Yeah.
Merle: I gotta raise my— raise my D average, so yeah, I’ll do it.
Taako: I’m good.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: He looks over to [garbled words] and he’s like,
Coach Taylor: Taako, you’ve got a J in P— this class. Are you sure? This could really save your—
Taako: All right I’ll save your ass.
Griffin: He says,
Coach Taylor: I can’t send you out there unequipped, come with me.
Griffin: And he takes you into a large room labeled ‘Sports Supplies’, and surrounding you are balls and bats and gloves and mats and pads and masks and sticks of every sport you can imagine. And Coach Taylor walks you to the middle of this room and says,
Coach Taylor: Okay, I’m gonna sanctify this room full of, just, beautiful sports equipment, so y’all can take you pick. It’s not a perfect solution but it’s better than nothing.
Griffin: And he kneels down in the centre of the room and he channels his holy symbol; his high school football state championships ring.
[audience cheering]
Clint: And you know what? That is such an inspiration to Merle—
Travis: We get it.
Clint: That he decides that he’s gonna dedicate himself—
[Griffin laughs]
Clint: —to sports!
Griffin: He says a prayer to sanctify this room of sports equipment and he says,
Coach Taylor: In this, our hour of need, we ask for your athletic patronage and protection. Oh, light of my life, end-zone of the cosmos.
Clint: You have been working on this for months.
Griffin: He says,
Coach Taylor: This is my lord, my saviour, Touchdown Todd.
[audience cheering]
Coach Taylor: Todd! We need ya real bad right now, buddy. Bless these here beautiful sporting goods with your undeniable power so that these children might go and kill a bunch of monsters with them. In your holy name I pray boom shaka laka.
Clint[???]: Boom shaka laka laka! Boom shaka laka laka!
Griffin: What sports gear do you outfit yourselves with?
Travis: Here’s what I’m gonna need.
Griffin: [audibly smiling] Yeah?
Travis: I need a football helmet.
Griffin: ‘Kay.
Travis: I need two bats.
Griffin: Yep.
Travis: Uh, I’m gonna need some shoulder pads.
Griffin: Qu— are you going qu— uh, to make this faster; quarterback pads or like, linebacker pads?
Travis: Quarterback pads, I gotta move.
Griffin: Okay, okay. Take plus 1 AC for your— your pads—
Travis: Yeah!
Griffin: And, uh, really— what’s really convenient is that all the bats have the same stats as the weapons you already have.
Travis: Oh nice!
Griffin: Taako and Merle?
Clint: I’m gonna wear a Lacrosse helmet and two fencing foils with the tips broken off.
Griffin: Okay. Everybody’s kinda double— double-fisting.
Travis: I’m ambidextrous!
Griffin: Yeah sure. Taako, what you lookin’ at? You still looking at that croque-monsieur recipe?
Justin: I’m getting pretty hungry over here! Uh, I take two Jai Alai cestas. They’re big fucking wooden scoops. They look sweet. For Jai Alai, y’know?
Griffin: Yeah Jai Alai, I know about Jai Alai. So you’re casting spells with your Jai Alai gear?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay. Uh—
Justin: And then I put them down for now and pick up a badminton racket. And, you guessed it, a shuttlecock!
[audience cheering]
Griffin: Cool, uh. Carey comes out strapped in with this track ‘n’—
Clint: A what? What did you just say?
Griffin: [confused] I haven’t said anything.
Clint: No, I mean what—
Travis: Wow, that was like 45 seconds delay—
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, no—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Jesus Christ!
Clint: I was trying to process what he said!
Travis: You can’t goof on it like 30 minutes later.
Griffin: Carey comes out and she’s wearing track ‘n’ field ge—
Justin: Rewind the podcast everybody, I gotta goof!
Griffin: She’s wearing track ‘n’ field gear with a big javelin.
Clint: Good call.
Griffin: And Killian is wearing full goalie pads with a big hockey stick.
Justin: Hell yeah!
[audience cheering]
Griffin: And they give y’all a big thumbs up and they kind of stack up on the locker room door. And Coach Taylor’s there and he looks at all of you and he says,
Coach Taylor: Y’all ready? You— you can do this. Clear eyes, full sports.
Merle: But is he staying in the locker room?
Coach Taylor: Yes I am. Hey, listen Merle, Merle! This is hard for me too. I got knee— bad knees from the sports.
Merle: From the sports?
Coach Taylor: Touchdown Todd is a fickle football god. One minute he’s honouring you with points and scores and RBI’s and the next minute [poof sound effect] your knees are gonzo. Alright 3, 2, 1, go!
Griffin: He throws open the door. Let’s roll initiative!
[audience cheering]
Travis: Hell yeah!
{65:38}
[music fades in and back out for commercial break]
Griffin: Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy. Your dungeon master, your best friend, and your… road dog. We’re hittin’ the road this weekend we’re going on a tour for My Brother, My Brother, and Me, it’s another podcast that we do. Thanks for listening to our live episode that we did here in Austin earlier this year. It was a really fun one, the crowd was really fun. The ending almost completely got away from us.
Which I think you’re going to experience here in just a little bit. Uh, here in a couple weeks we’re going to be putting up our other live show that we did in San Diego. Uh, which also was a lot of fun and I'm very excited for you to hear that one as well. And then I think the plan is after that, we’re going to start rolling out some of our little experimental mini-arcs where we’re gonna be taking turns running the games and playing different games. I think I have a cold, I think I’m just now realizing that just in the way that I’m talking into this microphone. Let’s talk about some advertisers so that I can go lay down and drink some Emergen-C.
[Ad 1- MVMT Watches, Ad 2- Naturebox, Jumbotrons]
Griffin: Thanks for listening and thanks for tweeting about the show using the ‘TheZoneCast’ hashtag. We’re really going to need your support as we kind of move around and try new stuff, keeping the show going and keeping the listener base strong. We don’t pay to advertise so we really appreciate you all spreading the word ‘cause it’s the only reason why the show has gotten to where it is today, and we are so, so, so grateful for that.
Like I said, in two weeks we’ll be doing our San Diego live show, putting that up. And then, after that we’re going to be moving on to our experimental arcs which I’m really, really excited to get to. Thanks to Maximumfun for having us.
[Maximumfun.org recommendations: Judge John Hodgman; Jordan, Jesse, Go!; Stop Podcasting Yourself; Lady to Lady]
[mcelroyshows.com]
Griffin: And with that, I think with that I’m going to let you get back to the weird ending to this live episode. And I hope you enjoy it, and I’ll talk to you in a couple weeks. Bye!
[music fades in and back out]
Justin: 4.
Griffin: Jesus
Travis: 7.
Clint: Of course, 19.
[audience cheers]
Travis: Actually, 21 for dad.
Clint: 21.
Griffin: First in the order is Merle Highchorch-chorch.
Clint: Of course. Yeah, when I say ‘High’ you say—
[scattered audience responses of ‘church’]
Travis: We don’t have time.
Griffin: Church.
Clint: Thank you.
Griffin: Okay so as you step [crosstalk] out into the gym you survey the battlefield and get a better idea of what this zombie horde is all about. There are in total 20 shambling zombies milling about the room and they’re all surrounding one big zombie in the center. And this bigger zombie is more composed than the others.
He’s wearing some armor and he seems to be in command of the whole horde. And all of them, king and horde alike, all turn in your direction as you step out of the room. Merle Highchurch, do you want me to load up all of the cleric spells on my phone? ‘Cause we can take like a minute and Travis and Justin can say a bunch of funny stuff—
Clint: Now hold on a minute. Did king— did coach friday night lights— did he— he blessed all this stuff, right?
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: So it oughta be, we just stick him a little bit and he’ll die, right?
Griffin: You can do attacks with the weapons, for sure, yeah.
Clint: Well I got enchanted fencing foils.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Clint: [crosstalk] So I pick out two relatively short zombies that I can actually reach.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: And I stab ’em in the gnards.
Travis: Whoa.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Excellent. Roll, uh, roll your attack there’s a little thing where it says— where your weapon is. I think it is— yeah, plus 5. Travis, find it for him?
Travis: I got it.
Clint: I got it! Plus 5! And it’s a 4.
Travis: It's a 9 total.
Clint: 9. Except I have— don't I have something that lets me roll twice?
Griffin: No you have—
Griffin & Travis: —disadvantage—
Griffin: —and I’m going to use that later. Thanks for reminding me.
[audience laughter]
Griffin: Somebody asked for music and uh—
[sad trombone sound effect] [Audience laughs]
Griffin: Drag ‘em. All right. You run up and you kind of poke two undead people in their— genitals and they say “Okay” and then— [Audience laughs] The order moves to the next person. Uhhh it’s uh… Carey is gonna take the javelin and just chuck it right at the king zombie. And she rolled a fifteen? Um. [single cheer from the audience] And, this zombie king, as this javelin is coming, actually picks up two of the smaller zombies and holds them up as a shield. [audience muttering, another audible cheer]
And so they get pierced by this javelin, uh, and they fall down dead but the king zombie is untouched. Uh, and Killian rrrrrruns up and does worse than Merle on her attack on some other zombies. So. Uhhh, there are fewer zombies now but the king is untouched. Next in the order are the zombies. Ummm… I think I’m gonna do Merle just cause you did run up there I think. [laughs]
Clint: Of course you will.
Griffin: That’s a 22 versus A.C. I think that might hit.
Clint: Yeah it— it does.
Griffin: [holding back laughter] Somebody said double check! Trust me on this one we’ve been doing this podcast for three years I— know what their AC is at this point. You take 20 points of damage as you are grabbed. Uh—
Justin: He’s fine.
Griffin: And you are pulled into the zombie horde—
Clint: Oh. Wow.
Griffin: —meaning you are grappled, also. Taako and Magnus you just see Merle just get pulled into this zombie horde. And take a bunch of damage. Dad are you going to write down how much damage you took?
Travis: I did. I did it for him.
Griffin: Next in the order is Magnus Burnsides.
Travis: Where is the mechanism to open the pool?
Griffin: … Oh.
[Audience cheers and applauds]
Clint: You’re gonna get ‘em wet?
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s right— it’s right next to you.
[Audience laughs and cheers]
Travis: I hit it.
Griffin: Okay! Yeah, sure! You pop open this— this thing, you pop open this— it’s probably a hatch of some sort and there’s a lever inside—
Travis: And I just make eye contact with the king as I do it.
[scattered laughter from audience]
Griffin: Uh and it moves quick, this mechanism that uh, I actually did write down. It’s a wonderful lifestyle. It opens up right underneath them. And the king rolls a nat 20 to avoid, but roll a— roll a d20.
[dice rolling]
Travis: Twelve?
Griffin: Twelve of the zombies, uh, do not save and fall into the— the pool below [some cheers from the audience] and you see them kind of fizzle and burn as they fall into the uh, the water. [Audience cheers] There are now only six zombies surrounding the king, uh—
Travis: I’m going to take my second attack.
Griffin: Uh, well! Yeah, I guess you attacked the lever so sure.
Travis: And I hurl um, my bat, Chance Lance-style, at the king.
Griffin: So you’re just throwing a bat?
Travis: You said they did the same thing as my weapons!
Griffin: Okay yeah. Uhhh roll a— [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Why don’t you break it first?
Griffin: Roll an attack.
Clint: Then it would be all jagged and shit.
Travis: Seventeen plus eight— nope! Plus nine—
Griffin: Oh—
Travis: —uh 26.
Griffin: That’s good the 25 wouldn’t have done it but the 26 does. Uh, yes that is a hit, roll damage?
Travis: Um.
Griffin: Just use Railsplitter’s—
Travis: Oh, not that great. Three, plus five, eight.
Griffin: Okay he just holds up one zombie who blocks the attack for him but the zombie disintegrates as this holy, uh weapon touches— touches him. [Audience cheering] Down to five zombies, Taako.
Travis: And now I am going to uh, action surge–
Griffin: [resigned] Ohshit.
[Audience cheering]
Travis: To attack— [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Aww man, I wanted to play D&D!
[Audience laughing]
Travis: To attack the other zombies in front of me.
Griffin: Okay!
Travis: I thought we’re trying to be quick, that is nineteen.
Griffin: Yeah that hits.
Travis: Five plus five, ten points of damage.
Griffin: Uh yeah, with a ten you take out one more zombie, and they just sort of smush underneath the weight of your holy axe— your holy bat, it’s not an axe. Sorry I got distracted cause I just heard somebody go ‘awwww!’ It’s a fuckin’ zombie! [Audience laughs] Uhhh Taako! Four zombies and the king.
Justin: I uh… take my… badminton racket—
Griffin: Kay.
Justin: Uh. And, uh, I uh, summoning all my strength, I, uh, thrrrrow it… at the center of his head.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: [slowly] I throw my badminton racket at the king’s head—
Griffin: That’s not a good job you’re doing I think.
Justin: Let me try, hold on. [Pauses as dice rolls, laughs] As it turns out, thanks to the grade I got uh, uh earlier it’s a twenty! Oh!
[Audience cheers]
Justin: [laughing] Amazing! Amazing!
Griffin: [laughing] Sooo stupid.
Justin: Amazing I can’t believe I—
Griffin: You throw a badminton racket—
Justin: —uh if we could roll the tape back, I did make sure that he wanted to give me that, so I did, I remember just a [crosstalk] decapitated with a badminton racket basically–
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’m surprised– surprised that this is what you wanted to spend it on. Alright, um you throw a badminton racket, roll a, I think your damage–
Justin: A magical— it’s a magical—
Griffin: A magical badminton racket. We’ll say it’s uh, roll a d12 two times. We never use that d12. Nobody does. [Audience laughs] Apparently.
Justin: It’s an eight! Aaand a twelve! [chuckles]
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Uhhh okay he holds up two— two zombies to sort of block it, and they evaporate as the racket hits them and it goes through and also hits him in the head a little bit.
Justin: Nice.
[Audience applauds and cheers]
Griffin: Okay. Heeeeee is, uh, has taken some damage. Top of the order again, Merle!
Clint: I cast ‘Burn Undead’!!
[Audience cheers]
Travis: Now are you using the Ring of the Grammarian? Because you could do that.
Clint: Do I have the Ring of the Grammarian?
Griffin: No, you don’t–
Clint: Awrgh.
Griffin: I mean, ‘Turn Undead’ is also very good.
Clint: Tr— Yeah! Turn… [audience cheers] I have a cold.
[Audience claps, shouts of ‘Turn undead!’]
Clint: Turn undead! It kills…
Griffin: [crosstalk] Shit.
Clint: … CR2.
{78.42}
Griffin: Okay, uhhh, the two little zombies, just, pfffft. Evaporate as you turn ‘em. Everybody failed their roll. The other, uh the king zombie, who is damaged, uh he… just. He just says, ""Fuuuck this!""
{78.57}
Griffin: Uh, and because of ‘Turn Undead,’ has to run away as fast as he can and because of that, he turns and he immediately just runs into the pool. [Audience erupts into cheers] Um.
Clint: WAIT A MINUTE! I WON?
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: I— [laughs maniacally] [Audience cheers louder]
Griffin: [while audience is cheering] The king– the king zombie is just dissolving, in the water. And just gurgling and screaming. And Coach— Coach Derek Taylor pops out of the locker room and flips the lever back and just closes the floor back over the king zombie as it goes down. And you celebrate, I imagine, that you’ve just done this, but almost—
Clint: [sings the Final Fantasy victory fanfare]
Griffin: Oh that would’ve been a good one to have in here too— [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh come on.
Griffin: Do I have anything?
Clint: How about ‘Can’t Touch This’?
Griffin: I only put in four like, audio cues, did you get a— [sound of a race horn blares]
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: As soon as the floor closes over that zombie, the room… changes a bit. There’s this red ripple that goes all throughout the room. And then… climbing out of this red ripple, uh, a huge form that I’ll describe. Two enormous wings emerge from the floor, and then two hands covered in razor sharp claws pull a long, draconic form from out of this red ripple, and this body is covered in these thick, metal plates from toe to tip, and as it emerges, suddenly standing in front of you is the imposing form of an ancient bronze dragon.
[Audience cheers]
Travis: I hit the button on the pool.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh actually that mechanism as you reach over to it there’s a red ripple, and that entire lever just disappears.
Travis: I punch the wall as hard as I can.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: You hurt your hand very badly. I think Coach Derek Taylor sees this dragon and sees the lever disappear and goes,
Coach Derek Taylor: [whispering] Ohhh nooooo.
Griffin: And he turns and runs back into the locker room. [Audience laughs] Angus is up on the— this dragon is like, a fucking tank. It looks invulnerable. Angus is up on the bleachers and he shouts,
Angus: Sirs! Sirs I figured it out!
Griffin: It’s so weird.
[Audience laughter]
Angus: I figured it out! It’s not just you three asleep in the real world, in this dreamscape, someone brought you into the dreamscape! All of this chaos is being created by someone in this very room!
Travis: It’s Brody.
[Scattered audience laughter, then gradual increase in laughter and cheering]
Griffin: [laughing] First… [more audience laughter] First in the order is, we’re starting at the top Merle Highchurch.
Travis: I mean I’ve seen TV and movies before.
Clint: Here we gooooo… I cast ZONE OF TRUTH!
[Audience explodes into cheers]
Griffin: I got a 9.
Clint: Huh?
Griffin: Who are you casting it on? Just like in the bleachers area where everybody is?
Clint: Yeah! Up where everybody is! It’s [crosstalk] convenient placing!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay, Principal Hawthorne says like,
Principal Hawthorne: I just thought Scandal was just okay last night.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh…
Clint: Broooody. Come oooooon. [in a sing-song voice] I cast Zone of Truth!
Griffin: Brody says uh,
Brody: What’s happenin’ in here is really good! And I like it! A lot! A big dragon, comin’ to kill everybody? Aww, heck yesssss.
Griffin: And he does a fucking grind on the bleachers.
[Audience laughs and applauds]
Griffin: Uhhh next in the order is—
Clint: Wait! What did everybody else say?
Griffin: Uhhh… Angus says like, [holding back laughter] Angus says,
Angus: I- I- I drink protein shakes everyday and it’s- [Audience laughs] it’s why I am the way I am and I hate the way they taste.
Griffin: Magnus, you’re up next.
Travis: Can I get over to the bleachers?
Griffin: Uhh, sure.
Travis: Okay. [laughs] I want to kill Brody.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: You’d be kind of at a disadvantage if you wanted to like, climb up there.
Clint: [laughs]
Travis: Then I want… to throw my bat at him.
Griffin: [laughs] Okay. [Some cheering from audience] Roll uh, plus attack. Plus attack is not uh, it’s not anything–
Clint: Now we need a twenty.
Travis: I have 16 plus 9, 25.
Griffin: Alright! Uh… I won’t make you roll damage. Umm…
Travis: I throw it really high.
[scattered audience laughter]
Griffin: You just kinda wang it at him like--
Travis: And— And I also just wanna be scooting past the dragon like,
Magnus: ‘Scuse, uh, uh one second!
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Oh yeah I should uh, uh… Attack of opportunity that’s a nineteen? Versus A.C.—
Travis: Miss.
Griffin: Really???
Travis: Yeah. With my shoulder pads I’m at a 21.
[Audience cheering]
Griffin: All right. this dragon takes a bite at you and you kinda get—
Magnus: Ah! One sec— Wait one second! I’ll be right back, dragon.
Griffin: And you “taste my steel” your bat up at Brody and you hit him in the gut, and he… falls off of the bleachers. And as he hits the ground immediately that bronze dragon disappears in the same red ripple, and Brody stands up. And he laughs. But in a much deeper, more sinister voice than you heard before. And he says,
Brody: Well done. You’ve… solved my high school puzzle. [Audience cheers and applauds] But! But you don’t seem to understand the rules. In this world—
Travis: I punch him.
[Audience laughter]
Brody: Uh. Wait, can you— can you please wait just one moment.
Travis: Uhh!
Brody: Just don’t punch me yet. In this world, I’m in control.
Griffin: And then that– oh I think I have music here. Uh and then that, uh… [Griffin makes a ‘boop’ sound, Persona 3 Final Boss Theme starts playing] That red ripple that you’ve seen a few times now? You see it spread out from his body, consuming the whole gymnasium, and he floats up towards the back of the room, and as he goes, pieces of wood tear off the walls and bleachers and up off the floor, all flying towards him. Uhh and he changes forms right in front of your eyes. Suddenly, Brody is the gymnasium.
His body… is made of these jagged pieces of wood all suspended off the basketball hoop in the back of the room, just two arms and huge, a huge wooden head sprouting out of the backboard on his chest, and below him the hardwood floor is cracked and peeled upwards repeal— revealing dozens of these just, waving hands grabbing at the three of you desperately. And the wall behind him collapses and the beautiful views of the campus you saw earlier have been replaced with this shifting red miasma that blots out the sun and the sky. And he says,
Brody: I have brought you here to learn your weaknesses and sell them to the highest bidder but now that you know my secret, you can’t leave the dreamscape alive.
Griffin: And he waves one of his wooden arms at you, and all of your sports equipment disappears in a red ripple. And you hear Coach Taylor shout from the locker,
Coach Derek Taylor: Touchdown Todd! Do something, they’re only children!
[Audience laughter, music stops]
Griffin: Everybody make a dexterity save.
Travis: [rising in pitch] Uuuhhhhmmmm? That’s a seventeen.
[Single whoop from audience]
Clint: That’s a four…
[Audience laughter]
Justin: Sixteen.
Griffin: Uhhh. Alright, Magnus.
Travis: Yes?
Griffin: All of your gear is gone. But the whole building shakes as he transforms. And the basketball that was stuck in the rafters gets shaked loose. [muffled audience laughing] And falls towards you, and you catch it. And you hear Angus shout,
Angus: Do it, guys!
Griffin: And Taylor shouts,
Coach Derek Taylor: Teamwork! Please! Do it!
Griffin: And I had this queued up for this moment?
[Space Jam theme plays {87.08} to audience cheers]
Griffin: [over audience cheering] You feel a tremendous power in this basketball. As Brody’s form waves off of the hoop at the back of the room.
[Audience is still cheering]
Justin: I cast Bigby’s Hand? But this time it looks like Michael Jordan’s hand, just like, taking the ball and ready to shove it in.
Travis: I— I do the greatest juke a human being’s ever done and do a side pass to Bigby’s hand.
Griffin: Uh okay. Make a— make a dexterity throw. These hands that are up off the floor are grabbing [crosstalk] at you.
Travis: [crosstalk] Shiiiiit! That’s an eighteen plus two that’s a twentyyyyyy!
Griffin: Alright you pass him— [Audience cheering] You pass it to Taako.
Justin: I cast Bigby’s hand—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay okay okay—
Justin: [crosstalk] that looks like Michael Jordan’s hand, and I shove it down his fuckin’ throat.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: You reach across the room. Make… the most important athletics check of your entire life.
Clint: I cast athletics boost on Taako!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: [laughing] You do!
Justin (muffled): It’s a SEVENTEEN!
[Audience cheers more]
Griffin: Take advantage on that because he cast Bless to improve your athletics roll—
Clint: That’s what I meant to say.
Justin: [voice rising into an excited screech] It’s a NINETEEEEEN!
[Audience cheers and applauds]
Griffin: I wish I hadn’t blown my quad city DJ—
[Justin, Griffin, Clint indistinguishable crosstalk]
Justin: Let me just get it one more time?
Griffin: There’s a— hold on I have a different song.
[“Wonderland Round Three” starts playing]
[Audience screams]
Griffin: You fucking reach your hand all the way across the room with the basketball, dodging these— I guess you’re like— are you off the floor or is this just your hand?
Justin: Yeah, I’m just flying through the air.
Griffin: And he’s— these hardwood hands are grabbing at you, trying to pull you down—
Justin: No dice!
Griffin: But they just aren’t doing it, and from the, fucking foul line Bigby’s hand reaches down and slams dunks the ball right in the center of Brody’s chest, and right when that happens Angus actually pulls out a wand and casts Shatter, and the fucking backboard just explodes [audience screams and cheers] as you dunk it in.
Clint: [laughing]
[“Wonderland Round Three” fades out]
Griffin: And as the backboard explodes the rest of the gymnasium seems just to disintegrate away around you, and the three of you are falling for a while as the gym is just gone, and you wake up in a— a dark, stone-wrought room. And when you look outside, you, Taako, have been here before.
You realise you’re in the Underdark, the drow capital. Um. You’re in a shady part of the Underdark, if such a thing exists. Um. And you’re lying on these three soft beds, um, all lined up next to each other and behind you is a fourth, and lying in that bed is a mind-flayer, an eldritch sort of humanoid creature that specialises in these kinds of psychic assaults, and it’s Brody. And as you all stand up from your beds, he reaches towards you. He says,
Brody: [weakly] If you get dunked on in the dream… [Audience laughs and claps] you get dunked on… [choking] in real…
[Audience cheers louder]
Griffin: And he— and he fucking dies!
[Audience cheers, Clint laughs]
Travis: And in case you were wondering, that’s how we beat Brody.
Griffin: And that’s how you beat Brody.
Travis: That’s a true story.
Griffin: Thank you all for coming to The Adventure Zone! That’s all I prepared! [Audience cheers] Sorry! [THEME MUSIC: ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson begins to fade in] Sorry I did such a bad time management job! Thanks for coming byeeeeeee!

[THEME MUSIC: “Déjà Vu” by Mort Garson (full song on YouTube)]
Griffin: I’m wearing a sweater from J Crew. [audience cheers] Alright, alright.
Travis: And now I have to shed a bunch of pieces so I can operate as a human being.
Griffin: Let’s go behind the music a little bit, let’s say there’s some pieces of Travis’s sort of tunic-girdle situation that maybe, the armor—
Travis: He’s had some offtime.
Griffin: He’s had some offtime(!)
Travis: There was another piece that went about my waist, or attempted to. [audience laughter] Listen, hard-living, you know what I mean? I beat the Hunger and then I experienced the hunger.
Justin: “I saw seven birds” oh hell yeah, fried, roasted, what’s up? Fucking eat those for sure. Where are these seven birds? Why are you holding out on me? I’m starving!
Griffin: Hi everybody, welcome to The Adventure Zone live in Dallas! [audience cheers] Sorry about the “yee-haw” thing in the intro, I sat backstage for like thirty minutes and couldn’t think of anything else to say.
Clint: Hey, it’s us!
Justin: I was backstage, it was about three.
Griffin: I get nervous, I need to dial in. Speaking [elongating the f] of… Do we want to talk about what Dad did today, or save that for MBMBaM?
Justin: Save it for tomorrow. I’ve seen the numbers and I know some of y’all aren’t coming tomorrow so buy your tickets, you’re going to get a great vignette about our dad.
Clint: It’s bad.
Griffin: You’re right, we should get into it because we got a lot to do today and we always run out of time. Do we have a timer?
Justin: [repeatedly, in an odd accent] Paul?
Travis: [elongated] Pauuuuuuul?
Clint: Paul! Ladies and gentleman! [presumably Paul has brought/shown the McElroys a timer]
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Thank you, Paul!
Justin: Go to paulandstorm.gov to hear some of their tracks!
Griffin: That they make.
Justin: That they make. Paul and his imaginary friend Storm.
[Griffin laughs]
Justin: He swears he’s real.
Griffin: Uh—
Clint: [crosstalk] Wait wait wait, before we get started—
Justin: [noises of surprise and disbelief]
Clint: I’d like everybody to look at the back of the theatre, everybody look at the back of the theatre.
Justin: These are the emergency exits [inaudible]
Clint: Okay, you can look back up here now. [Griffin laughs]
Clint: That’s where Bobby sits. Hey Bobby!
Griffin: Hey Bobby.
Travis: Hey! {2:58}
Justin: [stuttering] Hi Bobby, Bobby’s running the sound board up there, Bobby came to us before the show and said, “So what are y’all gonna be discussing tonight?” and I was like, “Well Bobby, that’s a very hard question to answer my friend, hold on a second.”
Clint: And he said, “Well give me a shout-out, that way I can wake up.”
Griffin: Can we get house lights for a second so we can see the good good cosplay that’s happening?
Justin: Yeah, house lights, could we get house lights for a second?
Griffin: If you are— oh there’s Bobby with the strobe, thank you Bobby.
Justin: Bobby’s got a strobe.
Griffin: Can we get house lights? Is there a switch or, is there a dial that says maybe “HL” on it, short for house lights? No, okay, then we can’t get house lights, we’ll do that after intermission! Let’s get into the adventure, here we go.
Justin: Hell yeah!
Clint: Yeah!
Travis: But, but Paul, if I could grab a writing utensil…
Griffin: Travis needs a writing utensil.
Justin: Oh shit Paul, me too dog! I’m so sorry!
Travis: We’re children!
Clint: I need a stylus.
Griffin: Look at this— [audience cheering for Paul]
Clint: Paul, ladies and gentlemen! Paul of Paul and Storm.
{4:16}
Griffin: Paul always carries around two big cups full of pencils, in his hands. Okay. So. The three of you are standing in an empty office featuring fairly humble trappings with two desks positioned side-by-side in front of a window overlooking an opulent city skyline. It’s been about six months— (softly, meekly) hey, uh, everyone here’s finished Balance, right? Okay, good—
Clint: Spoilers?
Griffin: Uh, maybe a little bit.
Travis: [underneath] You’ve had time!
Griffin: It’ll be light, it’s the name of the— it’s been six months since the Day of Story and Song and your lives had only just regained some semblance of normalcy when you received a letter inviting you to this office on this day. The three of you are kind of hard to pin down, I imagine, now given the fame you’ve acquired—
Travis: With the book tours—
Justin: Separate lives.
Griffin: Yeah. Due to the fame you’ve acquired thanks to your heroism on that day. But the postscript on the letter was difficult to turn down, particularly for one of you. It read, “P.S: Merle. C’mon. You owe us.” And the door to the office swings open and through it, you see the garage of the Goldcliff Battlewagon Racing League. Which is filled with vehicles being serviced by a dozen or so skilled mechanics, and through that door walk the dryads Hurley and Sloane. [The audience absolutely loses their shit.]
Justin: [crosstalk] Hell yeah.
Clint: [crosstalk] You’ve heard of them?
Travis: [crosstalk] So you’re familiar?
Griffin: And, uh—
Justin: Crystal Kingdom, I love this one.
Griffin: No!
Justin: Hell yeah. And they’ve got like, 80 crystals, and they’re like “We’ve gotta go back.”
Griffin: And Hurley says:
Hurley: Wow. To tell the truth, I thought there was a pretty slim chance you’d actually show up.
Magnus: I’m SO bored.
Griffin: Was that Magnus or Travis?
Travis: No, that was Magnus. That’s why he showed up.
Justin: The importance of character voices, folks. If you don’t have a character voice before now—
Travis: I did it— That was— Listen— That was clearly loud and booming, which is not how I normally sound.
Griffin: And Sloane says:
Sloane: How have the three of you been?
Magnus: SO bored.
Travis: Here, I’ll wave, I’ll put ‘em over there.
Justin: Didn’t want you to miss the best view in the house. If you put ‘em up there, they’re still—
Clint: That’s blocking your view.
Justin: There’s people right there. They need to—
Sloane: So pretty good then, or—
Merle: Yeah, good, they’ve been good. Yeah, they’ve been—
Justin: Actually, I think these two— Dad, too— I’ve got some people here who can’t get a really good— Yeah, there you are. Hello. Scuttle Buddy, you’re so great.
Clint: Scuttle Buddy! I know, right?
Justin: Listen, you paid full price, you’re gonna get the whole show, baby.
Sloane: So the three of you’ve been okay, or—
Magnus: Yeah, we’ve been good. I’ve been training dogs. It’s gone… okay. It’s hard not to cuddle!
Griffin: That’s always been my experience.
Travis: Now, was that Griffin?
Griffin: That was Griffin.
Clint: I got into HQ, I’ve been playing a lot of HQ.
Griffin: Okay, now this is Dad. Okay. Let’s take a minute.
Clint: Oh, I thought you were asking me!
Griffin: Now this is a podcast called The Adventure Zone in which we embody characters and we don’t necessarily answer questions as ourselves. And we’re all guilty of this.
Clint: Oh, character voice! Right? Okay.
Merle: I’ve been playing a lot of HQ.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: No?
Justin: Okay, but HQ doesn’t exist in this world…
Griffin: No, it’s a fantasy world. Technology exists.
Sloane: Taako, what about you?
Clint: Historical Quotient.
Sloane: Taako, I haven’t heard from you in a while.
Taako: Yeah, I’m rich now. [audience cheers] Could be richer though. I’m here to promote my school, “Taako’s Correspondence School of Wizarding and Witchcraft.” We’re just trying to get the word out about the school. You can pay whenever you want, classes will start at some point. But we do encourage you— the slots are filling up quick, so you are gonna want to pay in advance. When this exciting project kicks off, as soon as we hit some private fundraising goals, it’s gonna be good.
Griffin: Uh, Hurley says:
Hurley: Well maybe we can figure out some kind of cross-promotion—
Magnus: You’re a tree!
Hurley: Yeah. Well… like, half-tree, I guess?
Magnus: Awesome!
Taako: Very cool.
Hurley: Yeah, it’s pretty cool. Bees can be a problem sometimes.
Merle: Yeah. Tell me about it.
Justin: Oh, my God. I literally, this moment that you are sharing with me… That’s a wig, right? [Griffin laughs] This moment, I realized, “Hold on a sec! My dad got a white wig.”
Clint: It is a hot-ass wig, too. As a matter of fact: hey, look in the back!
Justin: You’re stickin’ with it.
Griffin: Hurley says:
Hurley: Well, things have been pretty good here for the most part. Took a while to clean the city up, but we managed just fine. Better than fine, actually. Now that the work’s done, Goldcliff citizens are just dying for entertainment. The battlewagon business has been booming, and that’s kinda why we called you all here. Why don’t you take a seat?
Griffin: And she motions toward some chairs positioned in front of these desks.
Justin: I do that.
Griffin: Okay, uh, Sloane takes a poster and unfurls it.
Travis: I rolled a 9 on taking the chair, what does that mean?
Griffin: I think you sit down, but the chair scoots backwards and makes a toot noise and you have to convince everybody...
Magnus: Uh, wasn’t me!
Griffin: Sloane unfurls this poster and you see a design advertising the Goldcliff Battlewagon Racing League Turbo Platinum Cup. Which takes place later today at the circuit located just outside the city. And then she unfurls it a bit further and it reads “Featuring Guest Racers Merle Highchurch, Taako, and Magnus Burnsides: Three of the Saviors of Faerun.” [audience cheers]
Travis: Now, listen— you’re all great, and I love the way you reacted to that, but was it going to be like “Yeah, so, would you like to watch? I got you some comp tickets!”
Griffin: Hurley says:
Hurley: Looks pretty good, doesn’t it? This is our main event of the season, and well, we need to make as big of a splash as we possibly can. Like I mentioned earlier, the folks here are hungry for entertainment, and because of that, several less scrupulous competing racing leagues have popped up in the city. Leagues that don’t prioritize things like… oh, say, the continued lifespan of their racers, quite as much as we do.
Griffin: And, uh, Sloane says:
Sloane: We’ve lost a fair chunk of our less discerning audience members to these leagues, but we’re hoping with the Turbo Platinum Cup today, we can re-establish ourselves as the premiere battlewagon league in Goldcliff and run those death races right out of town.
Merle: Let me speak for the group:
Travis: Okay, but do it in a character voice.
Merle: We’d be glad to, we know what you’re asking. Yes, we’ll sign the posters.
Taako: I’m ready.
Travis: Available for sale in the lobby.
Griffin: And then you walk off into the sunset.
Justin: Thanks for comin’ out, everybody.
Clint: [crosstalk] Goodnight everybody!
Taako: I’d rather not.
Griffin: Hurley says:
Hurley: Now, I understand you’re worried given how hectic your last race with us ended up being.
Taako: Hectic? You—
Justin: And then imagine I referenced something that happened in it.
Clint: Yeah, because it was four arcs ago.
Taako: There was a shark tank!
Hurley: There was a shark tank, you did remember that. And she turned into, like, a giant vine monster and that was pretty wild. [Taako: Eh. There was a shark tank.] But listen, you really—
Merle: Sounds good to me. ;)
Hurley: You don’t have to sweat anything— gross. We don’t— we’ve really gone legitimate since then. All of our racers are equipped with new and improved safety harnesses, they do the bubble thing, remember? But they also have a charge of, oh, what’s that spell? Spare the Dying? Merle, do you know that one?
Merle: ...Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hurley: You hesitated, so it seems— it seems like you’re looking at a list of cards with spells you know.
Merle: Yeah, I got it.
Hurley: Okay.
Griffin: She says:
Hurley: Anyway, death and dismemberment; it’s really not part of the equation anymore. We figured we can give folks a show without getting too gruesome about it.
{12:25}
Hurley: So you’ll each have one of these harnesses out there, I’ll be driving, and really, y’all appearing in the race at all is gonna be a huge attraction in and of itself. We don’t even need to win.
Magnus: Bullshit.
Taako: Yeah we’re— We will win.
Griffin: Uh, Hurley smiles, she says—
Magnus: And we’re going to be amazing.
[audience cheers]
Clint: [laughing] Oh that was cheap. That was so cheap.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yes it was!
Justin: So we’re at that phase now, right? Where we’re just…
Griffin: Just stand up on stage: Play the hits! Uh Abra-ca-fuck you? I don’t know. [audience laughter]
Clint: Glad we got that out of the way.
Griffin: Sloane says:
Sloane: I’ll be up in the press box making sure everything runs smoothly. Teams cap out at four and I’ve taken on a more managerial role in the organization anyway.
Magnus: Really put down roots.
[Clint laughs]
Sloane: Aw Jesus.
[mixed laughs and boos from the audience]
Clint: Aw come on.
Travis: Come on! [audience cheers] That was as Magnus. Travis would never make that joke.
Justin: Let him weave— Let him weave his tapestry.
Griffin: Sloane says:
Sloane: Also there is a grand prize of 6,000 gold pieces for the winning team, and I can— I can promise you Merle also that the next time one of your kids is endangered by an interdimensional cosmic force of mass destruction we’ll just… Go right ahead and save them again. Does that sound… Equitable?
Merle: That’s hitting me where I live, man.
Magnus: You don’t live with your kids, Merle.
Merle: No I don’t live with my kids. And we’re all the better for it!
{14:10}
Griffin: So Hurley and Sloane walk the three of you out into the garage and you see several battlewagons being serviced but the showpiece here, is on a rotating platform at the end of the room. It’s the Ram. And it's just how you remember it; sleek and black with silver armor plating, a harpoon gun mounted on the roof.
Clint: Can you do this in Denis Leary’s voice?
Griffin: I don’t think I could.
Clint: No, okay. {14:28}
Griffin: It’s got a long trunk that Magnus did so many stunts off of back in the day. And of course, a metallic Ram’s Head positioned at the front. It's a thing of beauty and Hurley says:
Hurley: I haven't made too many tweaks to the old Ram. It's hard to improve on perfection, but something tells me the three of you have learned some new tricks since your last go around, huh?
Merle: Ye— yeah—
Magnus: Nope!
[audience laughs]
Taako: You would think so.
Hurley: You look like you’ve leveled up like eight times or so, you should— [crosstalk]
Magnus: Oh! Yeah yeah yeah.
Taako: Yeah. We’re still very judicious with our spellslots though, let’s not go… wild.
Griffin: She says:
Hurley: Well, when we get out there you’re just gonna have to put on a good show. Nothing too gruesome, okay? I mean you can’t actually kill anyone but still folks might find some gnarly stuff—
Magnus: Question.
Hurley: Yes.
Magnus: Can’t? Or should not.
Hurley: Can’t. I mean, the belts will allow you not to— They won’t allow you to die.
Magnus: Excellent.
Hurley: Yeah. Uh so flag’s up in a couple hours we should probably get a move on. Oh! That reminds me.
Griffin: And Sloane walks over to a crate and pops it open, pulls out a few items.
Sloane: I've got a little memento for you.
Griffin: And what she withdraws from the crate are three masks [crowd cheers] that you wore during your first battlewagon race. In the shapes of a bear, an owl, and a mongoose!
Clint: Now you told him! You told him that, didn’t ya?
Travis: I was actually given this [the bear mask from the first battle wagon race] at C2E2, and it is my new favorite hat.
Clint: That’s not surprising.
Griffin: Why didn’t you have it when you came on before?
Travis: I was gonna wear it one way or the other.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I was waiting for just the right moment. My theatricality— No.
Griffin: Let’s fast-forward, ‘cause we’ve have spent a long time— Jesus. You’re outside now, whoa, and you’re walking the streets of Goldcliff toward the circuit at the edge of town. And sure enough: The town’s doing great. There are few signs of the attack that took place just earlier that year. There’s just sort of happy, well-dressed folks enjoying the pleasant weather. And one of these well-dressed folks, a male halfling dressed to the nines approaches the three of you and says:
Halfling: Good evening gentlemen. Do I have the pleasure of speaking to Merle, Magnus, and Taako, three of the saviours of Faerun?
Taako: You tell me.
Halfling: You… tell me!
Taako: Yes.
Clint: He will.
Taako: Now.
Halfling: My— my name is Alfred D’Gaul and I’d love to bend your ear just for a moment, I re— I realize you’re on your way to the big race, but I think you’re going to want to hear what I have to say.
Taako: Sponsorship opportunity? I love it, talk.
Alfred: Oh we could talk sponsorships all day.
Travis: Oh no, you’re becoming one voice! [audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh, he says:
Alfred: I operate a humble, but growing racing league here in town called the Blaze Wings. Now I know you’re probably thinking; “Hey that sounds like we’re describing an especially spicy flavor of buffalo wings. Perhaps the type that a restaurant might offer as some sort of food challenge to its diners.” But actually, no. It’s a very good name for our organization.
Clint and Justin: [laughing]
Alfred: Now I’m not sure what Hurley and Sloane have offered the three of you to participate in today’s festivities, but I’d like to make a counter-offer if I might. All you have to do is walk away, right now, and I will match the prize money offered for the race; six-thousand gold pieces for literally no work at all.
Magnus: [crosstalk] Like no—
Merle: No, they offered us ten.
Alfred: ...Ten thousand?
Merle: Yep. They said ten, ten thousand.
Griffin: He uh...
Clint: Euros.
Justin: Well, I’m gonna need you to roll, a die, please, Clinton.
Clinton: [crosstalk] Okay—
Griffin: Yeah roll a bl— uh, uh, what’s it called? Deception check.
Clint: (quietly) ...That’s this one?
Travis: Yep.
[Audience laughing]
Travis: A six!
Justin: [crosstalk] That’s a...
Griffin: [crosstalk] I also—
Clint: [crosstalk] I can read!
Griffin: I also rolled a six. [audience laughs] I think he— I think he pulls out a pocketbook and he’s like:
Alfred: Ten thous— Ten th— We can probably make ten thousand work, we could do the last four thousand in, in [cross talk] installments maybe?
Travis: [crosstalk] Wait wait, to be fair, he— [Merle: Down.] he gets a plus one to deception.
Griffin: Okay yeah,
Travis: So that’s a seven.
Griffin: That’s a success.
Alfred: Yeah, I can make ten thousand work.
Merle: I meant ten thousand down.
[audience laughs]
Alfred: How much is the juice?
Justin: [laughs] You got points runnin’ on it [crosstalk]
Merle: The vig— the vig is another five Gs, man.
{18:38}
Taako: Hey listen, we’re the saviours of Faerun, heroes of the land; we don’t need to discuss this. Yes.
Clint: [laughs]
Taako: You have a deal.
Magnus: Wait… Do we get it up front?
Alfred: Sure just sign here on this contract and ah—
Magnus: You got it!
Griffin: Alright, he shows you a contract!
Travis: Magnus signs and then walks towards the Ram.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: He hands you a bag with 10,000 gold pieces in it, down.
Justin: Wait, 10,000 apiece?
Griffin: Total, to split.
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, no, no. Wait, come on!
Justin: [crosstalk] Oh! Okay.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Do you have a plan for if we just take the money and run?
Alfred: Well you seem like good, enterprising folks who—
Clint: [laughs]
Justin: I’m talking to Griffin!
Griffin: No.
Justin: Okay, cause Taako says yes. I don’t understand why these other two did. Taako says yes I will take that offer.
Travis: Oh, I was just gonna take it and then still do the race anyway.
Justin: That seems— okay.
Griffin: Wait, did you just say that out loud?
Justin & Travis: No!
Clint: That was Travis’ voice.
Travis: Wait, let me run it back— [rewinding bloops]
Magnus: I would never!
Justin: Okay Merle, hurry up and talk us into doing this, 'cause I think—
Griffin: I think he’s good, no, I think he does it! You hand him a contract and he hands you 10,000 gold pieces. He says:
Alfred: I’ll talk to your people about getting the rest of the money to you.
Magnus: Sounds great.
Alfred: Sounds like we have a deal! Well, I’m gonna turn my back and walk away now, and not pay attention to where you go from here. [audience laughs] See ya!
Griffin: And he does! And now you have 10,000 gold pieces.
Clint, Travis, and Justin: Yay!
Clint: Can we buy some shit?
Griffin: Uh, no.
Justin: I know that it probably seems like that was really scummy of us, but we’re gonna give some of it to a local Dallas charity.
Griffin: [laughs]
Justin: Now you feel bad! Now you’re the bad guy!
Clint: Who deserves 5,000 fantasy gold pieces?
Justin: [crosstalk] Whoah, whoah, whoah.
Travis: [crosstalk] 5,000? Come on, Dad. 2,000.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Hang on, Dad.
Griffin: Okay so it’s a short while later, I guess you’ve headed to the circuit and taken your places for the race. You’re sitting inside—
Travis: After buying a lot of candy.
Griffin: Yeah. You’re sitting inside of Hurley’s wagon within a large crate, just like last time, positioned at the starting line, and the engine is puttering. Fortunately, you’re—
Travis: Pumping in time? Does the green light flash, the flag go up?
Griffin: Oh, stop.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Fortunately, this wagon runs on an arcane core, so there’s no fumes to inhale, which I only just thought of while I was prepping this part.
Clint: [laughs]
Griffin: Merle, you’re in the front passenger seat, Taako, you are standing in this cut-out space in the roof, where the harpoon gun is mounted, and Magnus, you are on the trunk, connected to the car with wires you have attached to loops on your harness. Basically the same arrangement as last time. And Hurley says from the driver’s seat:
Hurley: Okay, it’s a sold-out crowd today. We’re not racing for the fate of the planet or anything, so let’s just have some fun out there.
Magnus: Let’s murder!
Hurley: What’s, what?
Magnus: What?
Hurley: What did you say?
Magnus: What did you say?
Hurley: I said let’s have fun!
Magnus: Yeah!
Taako: I still don’t understand why I have to do this. That nice halfling said that he’d give me money not to.
Magnus: All we had to do was put some ink on paper. That means nothing in this world, there’s no lawyers or anything! What are they gonna do, take us to centaur court? Come on!
Taako: Some of us have businesses. I’m an LLC now.
Griffin: There’s no lawyers. But there’s necromancers. [eerily]
Clint: [crosstalk] Ohhh.
Travis: Alright.
Griffin: That’s nothing. [laughs] I’m not, no- And outside of the crate you hear two high pitched beeps, and then Hurley says:
Hurley: I love this part.
Griffin: And then a third beep, and the door to the crate drops, and Hurley slams on the gas.
Justin: Hell yeah!
Travis: Woo!
Griffin: And you are temporarily blinded as you emerge from the crate and quickly your eyes acclimate to the sunlight, and you try to take in your sort of chaotic surroundings. The circuit is nothing like the last track that you raced on. If you remember it was just kind of out in the desert with these pylons that people watched through.
Clint: Yeah, I remember.
Griffin: It used to be illegal, but now it’s totally cool here. There are actual stands now, reaching upward a couple of stories surrounding the track, just, filled with people. There’s no need for the viewers of this sport to remain anonymous anymore, and there are fifteen other battle wagons on the course with you tonight, and their designs are just as diverse as you expected, but there’s far too much movement and dust being kicked up for you to sort of, take down a mental list of them, and for several moments, Hurley shifts her wagon through several gears as you weave through the crowd, until, several hundred feet from the starting line, the wagons fall into an order. You’re in fifth place, let’s roll initiative.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Ah, Hoops has thirteen plus three, sixteen.
Travis: I have a six plus two, eight.
Clint: I have an eighteen, [audience cheers], plus…
Justin: Base setter, that seems like a good sign.
Clint: Where? Yeah! Plus two, twenty!
Griffin: Good roll. Okay. Y’all, I live in Texas, I feel really guilty about the ‘yeehaw’ thing. [audience laughs] I know that ain’t you. Okay, anyway. Hurley drafts behind the vehicle in front of you, and then pulls alongside it, bringing you into combat range. This wagon, like those you’ve faced before, has a peculiar design. It resembles a metallic, fifteen foot long caterpillar, with five segmented, armoured compartments, each with a pair of sharp, iron legs that skitter quickly across the racetrack, pounding the dirt as it runs. The vehicle’s sole passenger, a clean-shaven dwarven man, is controlling the caterpillar from inside of a glass-domed cockpit on the front segment. He eyes your vehicle, and starts to steer the caterpillar into a collision course with your battle wagon. Merle! You’re up first. Uh oh.
Travis: Don’t fuck up.
Clint: I’m going to cast…
Justin: Okay.
Merle: I’m going to cast—
Travis: No. No, you were right. Unless Merle is announcing, to the car, that—
Justin: [imitating Merle] Big news, everybody!
Clint: Merle casts Shield of Faith!
??: On—?
Clint: It’s a shimmering field, appearing and surrounding a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to ack [AC] for the duration. [audience laughs]
Griffin: Who are you casting this spell on?
Clint: Ahh… Oh! Ahh… [audience laughs] Ah, Taako! On Taako.
Griffin: [laughs]
Clint: I cast it on Taako.
Griffin: Okay! Alright! Taako, you have +2 AC.
Clint: [to Travis] You have a shield!
Travis: I’m the fucking tank!
Griffin: Doesn’t matter! Alright! You cast the shield on Taako.
Travis: It’s like you ran a marathon, and you made it to the last ten feet and then went, [crosstalk] ‘what’ and then made a hard right...
Griffin: [crosstalk] Don’t meta-game, this is beautiful. Merle had to make—
Clint: It’ll always work out!
Griffin: Merle had to make a panicked, command decision, and he just, did Taako. This is like that episode of Friends, where they were all the backseat— hold on, everybody— there’s a backseat in a taxi, and they hear what they thought was a gunshot, and then Joey jumped in front of Ross, and Chandler’s like, ‘what the fuck?’, but really Joey’s diving for his sandwich! [laughs] Fuck!
Travis: Fuck that’s good!
Griffin: Taako, you’re up.
Clint: And you’re welcome.
Justin: So what’s happening now?
Griffin: Caterpillar is getting closer, almost like it’s going to act next.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Ahm… I am going to cast a little evocation just to get things started. Ah, I am gonna cast— I’m not checking texts, by the way—
Travis: Yeah, seeing how the Max Fun Drive is going.
Justin: Yeah, still time to donate. [audience laughs] Ah, okay. I am going to cast Immolation!
Others: Oh!
Justin: Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. I’m counting the—
Griffin: Yep.
Justin: It’s a creature.
Griffin: The caterpillar? The vehicle, or the driver?
Justin: Inside the driver, would be safer for us, so I’m going to say—
Griffin: Inside the cockpit?
Justin: Inside the cockpit.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay, sure.
Travis: [crosstalk] Inside the driver.
Griffin: This is horrible. These safety harnesses will save you from death. I don’t know how that works [crosstalk] if you fill his cockpit with fire.
Justin: [crosstalk] Burn him from the inside!
Clint: [laughs]
Travis: I did ask—
Griffin: His charred corpse steps out of the cockpit, yeeah...
Travis: I did ask for clarification between can’t and shouldn’t.
Justin: It’s like prison! I’m killing one early so they know not to fuck with me!
Griffin: Yeah, okay. Roll that beautiful bean footage.
Justin: So you have to make a dexterity saving throw.
Griffin: I got another six. Wait, plus two, eight.
Justin: [raspberry noise] That’s a big ‘N’ ‘O’ on that one good buddy, you’re gonna need to take 7d6 fire damage.
Clint: [singing] Burn, baby, burn!
Travis: Don’t worry, he has a safety harness on.
Griffin: Okay. Okay.
Justin: You’re also gonna be burning for a minute.
Griffin: Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hey, Juice? Do not worry about that part. [audience laughs] I think the 7d6 is just gonna get me. Go ahead and roll your d6. Actually, wait, I can do a—
Justin: Also, you know what, this is neither here nor there, but you are also shedding a bright light in a 30ft radius. [giggles] I don’t know if that’s-
Clint: [laughs]
Travis: And the crowd goes wild.
[the crowd does indeed, go wild]
Griffin: I got a 34.
Justin: Wait a second, hold on, hold on, hold on. It’s up, there you are.
Travis: Yeah. Not surprising: bear hat, very warm.
Griffin: 34 fire damage, as you just see this dwarven man like ‘Eyy?’ [immolation noise]
Travis: [laughs]
Taako: You’ll be fine!
Griffin: And then there’s a 30ft radius of bright light, [audience laughs] and that’s cool.
Justin: And it makes a spotlight on Taako, and he goes:
Taako: Sign up for my school!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: I think for added effect as well, the cockpit is soundproof, so you just see like [presumably does something amusing]
Clint: [laughs]
Justin: That’s gonna make good podcast listening, Griff!
Griffin: And they are not dead, but—
Travis: Sad.
Griffin: Beaten. Vanquished. However, he was going to act next. The caterpillar was on a trajectory to collide with the car, and I think it still, sort of, was moving in that direction, and tries to trample over the vehicle. Everybody make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Eighteen, plus two, twenty.
Justin: Eleven.
Clint: Five?
Griffin: Wowzers.
Clint: Plus one, six!
Griffin: Oh that’s good! No. No. Magnus is safe, Taako and Merle, you take 22 points of piercing damage.
Justin: Hachi-machi! {29:45}
Griffin: As the legs—
Clint: Wow. That sucks for you, pal.
Justin: You too, dog.
Griffin: And with that, the caterpillar just goes completely over you, and I think it just tilts over, and falls to the side, and crashes into the side barrier of the track.
Clint: Aww.
Travis: I was gonna do something so cool, too.
Griffin: Well, there’s more wagons. And I think as it falls, you see the cockpit tumble open, and you see this dwarf come out, and he just looks kinda like, singed, and he’s just like, ‘huh, oh well!’, but he’s totally fine.
[audience laughs]
Travis: And he kinda has a look, like, ‘ugh, what a day.’
Griffin: He kicks the dust, he’s like, ‘aww, shoot!’
Travis: Well, next time!
Griffin: Hurley takes a turn with expert precision, putting you just behind, bumper to bumper, the next wagon in the order. This vehicle has a long, cylindrical body. It has a narrow cannon in front, a single, huge exhaust pipe at its rear, and just behind the cannon, is a glass tank filled with a strange, yellowish fluid. It is a giant vape pen. Anyway. [audience laughs] It has four gerblin passengers, all saddled on top like a rowing team. The rear rider sees your wagon behind them and it shouts out and suddenly the exhaust pipe at the rear end of the vehicle emits a massive plume of fog, obscuring your vision, and hiding this vehicle and the entire racetrack from your sight. Magnus, you’re up. {31:18}
Travis: Of all the people [Indistinguishable audience shout] well [giggle] What is the..?
Justin: We don’t actually, but if we use your thing everybody will know the jig is up.
Travis: Is the vehicle metallic?
Griffin: It is.
Travis: Cool.
Griffin: Except for the vape juice container. The flavor by the way is…
Clint: Peas.
Justin: Mango.
Griffin: PEA-FLAVORED VAPE!? [audience laughter] Go to jail. [audience laughs louder] Mango. It’s mango mint, so you get those tropical notes and then you get like a “ooh” but “oooh!” [audience laughter]. Magnus, you’re taking heavy rips on the trunk, what do you do?
Travis: Right now I’m just enjoying it, frankly.
Griffin: I will say, sort of the mechanic here, 'cause this is kinda how it worked last time: if you want Hurley to reposition in any way or do any sort of maneuver to aid... specifically I think this applies mostly to you [meaning Travis/Magnus] since your shit's all sort of physical.
Travis: How close were we to it?
Griffin: Just behind ‘em like, bumper to bumper.
Travis: Okay great. So, can I get to the front of the car?
Griffin: Yeah sure, you have to unhook yourself. Oh, no, the rails run front to back.
Travis: Yes, so I get to the front of the car.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And I deploy my magnetic charge.
Griffin: Oh shit, what?
Travis: Yeah, my magnetic charge.
Griffin: I forgot I— you— Yes!
Travis: Fist-sized ball that produces magnetic field that repels metal objects.
Griffin: You remembered you had a magic item!
Travis: Yes I did. [Audience Cheers] And I kind of, as I activate it, chuck it towards the vape pen car.
Griffin: Uhh, okay, what we have to figure out. I’m totally into this... Hurley’s battle wagon is also metal.
Travis: That’s why I threw it forward.
Griffin: Okay, but where are you kinda aiming it on the vehicle.
Travis: Forward.
Griffin: To the front of the vape pen?
Travis: To the exhaust pipe. Mmmm...
Griffin: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Travis: [laughs]
Griffin: Okay. Here's what I’ll say, normally you could just— be able to do this. You can’t see because of the plume of fog instead of giving you disadvantage or anything, I think it’s just a straight up like, attack roll of you throwing this thing plus dex.
Travis: 14 plus dex is a 16.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Wait. Wait wait wait. I thought he had disadvantage. Doesn’t that mean he has to roll twice?
Griffin: No no, he doesn’t have disadvantage that’s what I said. Okay, you throw the magnetic charge…
Travis: I mean plus if it’s an attack roll I get like…
Griffin: Yeah you’re cool, you get like plus a hundred. You throw the magnetic charge forward, into the exhaust pipe, Luke?
Travis: Yeah, fuck it. [audience laughs] Listen, we got an hour and a half to get through this whole thing?
Griffin: Yeah sure.
Travis: I throw it in the fuckin’ exhaust pipe, ay.
Griffin: Okay here’s what happens. You throw it in the exhaust pipe and it disappears as it goes into the exhaust pipe and then the magnet expands. I don’t know how this would work.
Travis: Yeah, it sets off a charge of—
Griffin: It sets off the charge. I think the way that this sort of works is the back half of the vehicle tears itself apart. I think it just rips itself apart and now it’s a kind of— maybe a little— a humble vape pen. They don’t all have to be real long folks. Uhhhhh, I’m not doing that joke. But the back half of it— two of the gerblins just go flying. And shrapnel is shredding their bodies, but then they're like, “Hey heyyy.”
Justin: It’s all in fun!
Griffin: It’s great! And you have essentially taken care of half of the vehicle.
Travis: Okay so that’s my first attack. [audience laughs]
Clint: [Laughs]
Justin: Wait, and after you threw that… [audience laughs]
Clint: For those of you listening at home, Justin is leaning over talking to Travis.
Travis: And when it lands and explodes, Magnus goes,
Magnus: Cotton!
Griffin: Yeah yeah, sure. All right, and what do you do for your next attack? And look at that timer.
Travis: Are there more gerblins on the thing?
Griffin: There’s two more gerblins.
Clint: We are hell on gerblins.
Travis: So it’s a distance thing?
Griffin: Yes. Also because you blew up the back half, the smog is no longer coming out, it is a broken vape.
Travis: Okay, I am going to need my Chance Lance. [audience cheer] I’m trusting that it’s gonna be there.
Clint: Let’s pause for a moment.
Justin: Paulandstorm.gov [presumably because Paul came onstage briefly.]
Travis: These were made by @saltyspunny on Twitter, who brought them for us.
Griffin: It’s so fucking sick.
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: Folks at home. Travis has a Chance Lance.
Travis: I have a beautiful Chance Lance.
Griffin: It’s real.
Travis: I hurl—
Justin: Throw it at the audience dude, come on.
Travis: Okay yeah.
Griffin: [Laughs] ""Tragedy tonight as a—""
Travis: I hurl it at one of the gerblins. Is one of them driving?
Griffin: They’re both driving.
Travis: What?!
Griffin: It’s like a bobsled.
Travis: Okay but what is the—
Justin: Except one of them is a student driver.
Clint: [Laughs]
Griffin: I will say they’re in a row.
Travis: Okay, I throw it at one of them, I don’t fucking care. So that’s — now that appears to be a failure, but it is six plus ten so that’s 16.
Griffin: That’s a hit, my friend.
Travis: Being a warrior rules! And then it is—
Griffin: It’s called fighter.
Travis: Well actually, it’s I think bruiser or whatever— oh no, ruff boi.
Griffin: Ruff boi. [Audience cheers]
Travis: I didn’t do much damage, I only did six damage.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s not very much.
Travis: But then I call it back to me.
Griffin: Okay, here’s how it works.
Travis: How does the bubble handle piercing damage exactly?
Griffin: Here’s how it works, you throw it and you hit the back one and it also goes through the front one. They both take six damage, and as you call it back it does six more damage, for a total of twelve damage. And with that, both gerblins— they’re just gerblins— they—
Travis: [Laughs]
Griffin: —slump off the side of the wagon and I think it just kind of just slows down.
Travis: And I turn to Taako and I say,
Magnus: What are the chances?
Griffin: Okay. We can’t. Half the audience— half the time is spe—
Travis: I don’t care what you think.
Griffin: You’re losing them, Travis.
Travis: I do, I care very much.
Griffin: I think vape pen— kind of half vape pen just kind of slows down and Hurley has to steer the battle wagon around it to get in front of it. And then you see just two more wagons. I put cars here. This is the only time I missed it. You see two more wagons between you and first place and as Hurley brings your wagon into range of them it almost seems like they slow down, so as to put you right between them. And that’s when you recognize that these two nearly identical vehicles are working in tandem. They’re both imposing figures. These eight foot high rectangles of rusted brass, each one has four antennae positioned at their corners, and they’re all facing you. And from your position you can just barely see these small rectangular vents on the front sides of these rectangular wagons which you assume to be the view ports through which the racers inside are watching the track. The one on your left is outlined with a red trim around its edges and the one on your right is outlined in blue. Merle you’re up. Two wagons, one to the left, one to the right, big rectangles with antennae on them.
Clint: Rectangles with antennae. Oooh.
Justin: [Clears throat]
Clint: Okay Merle casts—
Travis: Here we go.
Clint: Gate!
Travis: What? A third spell?
Clint: He conjures a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range in a precise location on a different plane of existence. [audience laughs]
Justin: Okay... What?
Griffin: No no no. Good. Good good good.
Clint: Okay, and I’m gonna cast it in front of the blue one.
Griffin: Ah, you’ve disarmed the bomb— that’s not how this works. It’s fine. Okay, do I do anything? Or…
Clint: Uh… The victim cannot do anything, they just have to go into the gate.
Griffin: Travis, what’s the fuckin' card say? [audience laughs]
Clint: The portal is a circular opening, which, I need my glasses for the second half of this show.
Travis: You have a son.
Clint: Okay, thanks.
Travis: Let me just read it.
Clint: 'Cause I can’t see shit.
Griffin: How big is the opening Travis, like the size of like a...
Travis: It is five to twenty feet in diameter, the portal lasts the duration which is up to one minute.
Griffin: Five feet in diameter, okay. You conjure a gate in front of the blue one, and it’s five feet in diameter…
Travis: Five to twenty feet. Five to twenty.
Griffin: Five to twenty feet. What plane of existence are you sending them to? Don’t say the Hunger, 'cause that’s gone.
Clint: Oh... Uhhhhh.
Travis: Heads up, you’re welcome.
Clint: The astral plane. Y’know where—
Griffin: [Laughs] [Audience laughs and cheers]
Clint: Where astral shit hangs out.
Griffin: That’s the plane of the after-life, and that’s very good.
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: So, okay.
Clint: Yeah, they’re going there. To that—that plane. That’s the plane…
Justin: Tell me more about these harnesses. Yeah, very good harnesses today I hope.
Griffin: We see— okay— you see this gate appear in front of the blue one and all of you see the blue one just like at speed with you, and then you see like a flat line of like, blue fire, and then it passes through it and then it’s just not next to you anymore and then we cut to Barry, Lup and Kravitz. [audience cheers] And they’re talking to the Raven Queen and she’s giving them a dire mission and there’s windows, they’re in the prison where they do all their work. There’s huge windows outside and you see the endless sea of souls outside, and they’re talking and it’s a mission of much import. And then just this giant car just, vwoomp, falls past the window, and they all look to the side, and then they just look back, shrug, resume talking.
Travis: ""Merle, probably Merle.""
Griffin: And then from inside we see this halfling, and he’s inside the thing just like, looking through the window at this sea of souls he’s falling through but he’s just like,
Halfling: I’m okay, I guess? [Clint and Justin laughing in background] This one’s weird.
Griffin: Taako— {42:00}
Justin: I know what the next live episode is gonna be. Go to rescue that poor son of a bitch.
Griffin: Taako, you are up. You just have the red rectangle wagon now.
Justin: Ummm. Is it posing any threat?
Griffin: Yes, so those antennae now have started to spark a little bit with electricity, almost as if they had you sandwiched between them that was gonna be a really cool big attack, but then.
Clint: Ooohhh. Aaahhh. Okay, that’s why you gave me that really shitty look.
Griffin: I gave you an excited look, that was very good.
Travis: Well, he didn’t expect you to be competent.
Clint: Yeah, that’s true. Fooled him. [Travis and Clint laugh]
Travis: It only took three years of hustling.
Griffin: What you got, Taako?
Justin: [Sigh] I’m gonna do another magic.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: What?
Justin: Here’s one of the magics— and you know I’m trying to make it—
Griffin: Do some fun.
Justin: Just trying to do something fun.
Clint: The people of Dallas deserve fun. [audience cheers] Give them some fun, dammit.
Justin: I don’t know what that means.
Clint: I know, I know.
Justin: I got you.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: So Taako extends his fingers, and you expect there to be like, fire and shit but instead you just get [Beatboxing] It’s a bass, there’s a bass line and then he wiggles his ring finger and a melody extends [Beatboxing]
Griffin: Is he playing Drop Mix on the—
Justin: No, he’s playing Otto's Irresistible Dance. It’s a sixth level enchantment. Don’t worry about rolling, it says ""irresistible"" right there in the title.
Griffin: [Laughs]
Justin: Choose one creature you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place, shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration of one minute. That is on the driver, obviously.
Griffin: Yeah sure. A hatch on the top of the vehicle pops open and you see another halfling pop up and is now sort of Teen Wolf surfing on top of this vehicle. And then he just starts doing the Cupid Shuffle, but so hard. Like hitting it so fucking hard. Just like slide to the left like URGH! And then he slides to the right and falls off the fucking battlewagon.
Clint: [Laughs] And then pops up from the ground and goes—
Griffin: And he gives a big thumbs up. And he looks around and he’s like,
Halfling: Where’s my friend? That’s my best friend. He’s getting married tomorrow and I’m his best man.
Griffin: As you conquer the two electrified wagons and leave them in your dust you see nothing ahead of you but empty track and the smoking rubble of a few of your competitors.
Travis: We’re gonna wrap this up early.
Griffin: This has been a particularly battle-filled battle wagon race it would seem, but there’s nobody ahead of you to challenge your final lap. Behind you though, is another story. You turn in unison to the sound of massive footsteps and see, quickly approaching, a massive battle wagon in the shape of a tyrannosaurus rex. It is impressively to scale, with razor sharp fangs, small cute arms, and two massive legs that are currently bounding towards you gaining speed. And it lowers its head to ram your wagon and behind its eyes, you see its driver, a human smiling with sinister intent. And then... the T-Rex explodes. As—
Travis: Ohh I was gonna say faster, must go faster, and you fucking stole it.
Griffin: Oh, say it.
Magnus: Faster, must go fast—
Griffin: And then the T-Rex explodes.
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: As does the ground around and behind you. And when the smoke clears, the T-Rex is gone, and you see its racer flailing away from the scene but still pretty good. And then you hear whistling from above, and then more explosions which Hurley weaves through deftly. But the heat of the bombs is flashing against your face…
Travis: Oh shit, we’re in the Red Zone.
Griffin: And you f— Nerd Alert. And you follow the sound of the whistling upward and find in the sky, three flying vehicles above you. A wide winged metallic bomber that’s readying another salvo. A dragon-shaped vehicle with wings covered in bright red canvas, and a small wooden skimmer with an auto crossbow mounted wings—
Travis: Blaze Wings!
Griffin: And each of you— thanks, Travis, that’s great— and each of these planes is towing a colorful banner behind, and when read together they read, “Want a real race? Take to the sky with... the Blaze Wings.” [others laugh] We’re gonna take intermission, we will be right back. We’ve got posters and merch in the lobby. Go and we’ll be back soon. Bye.
[Interlude music]
Griffin: Hey everybody this is Griffin McElroy, your dungeon master, your best friend and your big dog. Woof woof, where’s mah big dogs at? Thanks for listening to The Adventure Zone, our live show from Dallas from earlier this year. Hope that you are enjoying it, we’re putting up a live show this episode because Travis was on an extended vacation so we needed some to cover for him, but we'll be back in two weeks on Thursday May 31st with a new episode in the Amnesty arc. We’re gonna be getting back to that soon, but for right now let me tell you about some of our sponsors. First off I want to tell you about Casper.

Got a Chumbotron here, and for thi— Did I call it a “Chumbotron”? I’m gonna email Jesse and see if we can change the name of that. This Chumbotron is about the Once and Future Nerd, which you can find wherever you get your podcasts. Or you can say hey to them on Twitter, Tumblr, or Facebook. The Once and Future Nerd is a tale about three teenagers from Pennsylvania who are transported to a fantasy world on the brink of civil war. As they take their new reality into their own hands they meet a colorful cast of misfits, fulfill and break all those fantasy tropes you love, or hate, and discover power they never even imagined. This epic saga is brought to life with sound effects, score, and a full cast of award-winning actors doing their damndest to make you laugh and or feel things. Aww that sounds nice, I haven’t felt something in a while, and that sounds bleak but maybe I’ve been waiting on this podcast to get me there, it’s the Once and Future Nerd, again wherever you find your podcasts. Or on Twitto, Tumbo, or Facebo. I also want to tell you about Ghost Puncher. It’s a webcomic but it also has a companion piece, D&D storytelling podcast called Ghost Puncher Corps. You can find it at GhostPuncher.net. Here’s what they have to say, Ghost Puncher and Ghost Puncher Corps— Corps? C-O-R-P-S. I’ve never been entirely sure how to pronounce that word but I’m gonna say corps— are super natural adventurers, tasked by Lucifer herself to keep order between the living and the dead. A few things you may find in the Ghost Puncher universe. Violence, nudity, body horror, dirty jokes, swear words, demonic shape shifting truck nuts? Okay, wasn’t expecting that. Good but nevertheless suspicious pecan Sandies, Big Billy’s potato product, werewolf pro wrestlers, a society of mutant subterranean jack rabbits, crunchy riffs, sexy synths, and a whole bunch of hopelessly gay ladies. That is Ghost Puncher, and Ghost Puncher Corps, and you can find that at GhostPuncher.net. Thank you to everybody who’s been tweeting about the show using the ""thezonecast"" hashtag, I sure do appreciate you spreading the word about the podcast, and about Amnesty, and about all the stuff we do here on the show. If you have a friend who you think might be into the shit we sling, then go ahead and just send them our way, And that’s cool when and if you do that. Wanna tell you, we have a project we’ve been working on with the Mysterious Package Company, it is a direct mail adventure, that we will send you on in Taako’s Correspondence School of Magics and Cantrips and Other Stuffs. It’s pretty cool, I’ve used the Mysterious Package Company stuff before and they’re just neat little mysteries delivered to you in the mail, that you, y’know, solve puzzles, and do activities, and there’s a narrative component. You get some like, physical rewards for doing it. We’re really excited about this project and you can find out more at mysteriouspackage.com and look for the link for Taako’s Correspondence School of Wizardry, Cantrips, & other Magicks. Also we got a comic book, or rather a graphic novel. That’s what you call them I guess when you want them to sound like, cool, and big, and smart.

[Interlude music]
{53:03}
Griffin: Okay, so! Act two, begin! Hurley slams on the gas, narrowly avoiding another salvo from the enormous bomber overhead. You hear a loud clanking and whirring from the plane as it reloads for another assault. And, as if to run distraction for its companions, the smallest of the three vehicles— the wooden skimmer armed with a huge crossbow on its underside— flies down to hover just above your battlewagon. Its pilot flips some switches from its exposed cockpit and the crossbow readies a shot. It’s actually the skimmer’s turn in the order, and I think—
Justin: [softly] Damn!
Griffin: —it launches a HUGE bolt right at Magnus, who is positioned on the trunk of the vehicle, Death Proof-style.
Justin: Luckily, he’s got that magic shield that Dad made him.
[audience laughs]
Travis: You didn’t. The joke is you didn’t, you protected the magic-user—
Griffin: Twenty-four versus AC?
Clint: Oh, Taako’s the other one!
Travis: Hold on, hold on!
Griffin: There’s no way you have fucking airplane proficiency! Those don’t exist!
Travis: No, I know that. I’m looking to see what Fletcher’s Mitt does, cause I can’t remember.
Griffin: Oh, yeah…
Clint: It catches arrows!
Griffin: And it gives you plus one AC to projectiles, and if you block it, you catch the missile.
Travis: And then I also have the Giant’s Ring, and I assume — cause you said it was a giant crossbow.
Griffin: [nervously] Okay…
Travis: I— have I fought against crossbows before? I have, 'cause of Killian.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: So yes, actually—
Griffin: That makes 24— okay… [audience cheers] This fucking crossbow-wielding anti-infantry vehicle shoots a giant crossbow bolt at you, and you just— WHONK! [audience laughs and cheers] You whonk it, and—
Travis: [laughing] And I throw it back!
Griffin: It is your turn…
Travis: And I throw it back! [audience laughs] No, I— well, I’m gonna hold onto it and I’m gonna grappling-hook-swing up into it.
Griffin: Your grappling hook?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: You have one of those...
Travis: Yes I do.
Griffin: Okay…
Travis: I can use it once per day, I’m remembering all my items!
Griffin: Uh— [audience cheers] any hot deets in there, or…
Travis: Yeah, I’m sure there are [laughs] things… yes, grappling hook, good for one use per day to climb something like Batman.
Griffin: [incredulously] That’s the end of it, what the fuck!
Travis: That’s what it says in the wiki!
[Audience laughs]
Clint: Good ol’ wiki!
Griffin: [mockingly] “I just feel like the world of Balance was so much more fleshed out…” [laughs]
Clint: Well it went for 12 years!
Griffin: Okay, uh, alright! You do that! You — Peew! Zip! Zing! Whoa! Aw man!
Travis: Now I would like to use my vehicle proficiency to try to take over the vehicle.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Now, it’s an open cockpit, right. I'm thinking like a biplane, right? Like sort of an old-timey biplane with a crossbow mounted underneath, however, there is somebody in there, so it’s not— you’re not rolling against the airplane, like, “I’m doing the Airplane Takeover Roll!” You’re gonna have to do something about the person in the pilot seat.
Travis: Okay, okay—
Justin: Why does— I’ve always wondered— why does Travis get to do so many things every time?
Travis: Why do you get to summon horses and dinosaurs and shit?
Griffin: The uh, the—
[audience member yells out “GARYL!”]
Travis: I know his name is Garyl, I’m on the show!
Clint: I thought it was Garyl.
Griffin: The grappling hook was a move action, this is your action-action.
Travis: And I get six of those!
Griffin: Okay, yes.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: Okay, I’m going to— I don’t know— stab him!
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: With the bolt…?
Travis: With what? I don’t know, I’ve got so much!
Griffin: Well then fucking pick something!
Travis: I’m going to— I don’t know— feels like a sneak attack, doesn’t it? I’m going to—
[Justin and Clint laugh]
Travis: Uh...
Justin: Very sneaky!
Travis: I’m gonna chop his head off with Railsplitter, fuck off!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Okay. Roll it. Roll that bean footage.
Clint: Yeah, good luck, harness.
Travis: That’s a 26.
Griffin: [sarcastically] Yeah, that just hits.
[Audience laughs]
Clint: And it does not cut his head off fatally.
Travis: No, that is an eight plus five— thirteen.
Griffin: Okay, with a thirteen, you get into that neck meat, but he kinda flexes like,
Pilot: Hrrgh! Hrrragh!
Griffin: And the head does not come off.
Travis: I come at it for a second time.
Griffin: He laughs after the first attack, like,
Pilot: Ha ha! Now it’s my tu— what?
Travis: Uh, seventeen.
Griffin: Uh, yes.
Travis: That is ten points of damage.
Griffin: It’s just on there with sinew and thread, and he’s like,
Pilot: Ha ha ha! Now it’s time for my turn!
Travis: I action— uh, action surge. [audience laughs] Nineteen.
[Clint laughs]
Travis: That’s, uh, thirteen again.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: [sing-song voice] I do one thing and I do it good!
Clint: And over and over again!
Griffin: His head... comes off. And, he’s like:
Pilot: Ha ha, I go— oh!
Griffin: And it starts to, like, slide off his neck, he’s like:
Pilot: Aww, shoot.
Griffin: But... still alive, he’s also wearing a harness, so he’s good to go.
Justin: These are good— can we keep these harnesses, they are very good!
Griffin: No, they only work… today. And, [audience laughs] uh, and I think his whole body, I think the — oh, here’s what happens — the plane starts to tilt, and his whole body just slumps out, and it also gets run over by Hurley’s battlewagon, but he’s still, like:
Pilot: [painfully] Oookaaay…
Griffin: Uh, the plane is starting to roll a little bit, there is still a tether, I think — well, no, I guess it was just a grappling hook, so it’s just you in the plane. Um…
Travis: [softly] It’s mine now.
Griffin: Is it— you’re in it? Okay, you’re in it, I’m not gonna do like a “you have to save the plane,” I think—
Travis: It’s my fucking plane now.
Griffin: Yeah, you have a plane now. Ha ha ha. Now I have a plane.
[Travis laughs]
Griffin: Okay, you did some cool stuff there. Merle, it is your turn. You got two more planes— and these planes are high above. They are pretty— pretty high up there, like… seventy feet? Does that feel good to everybody?
Clint: Wow. That’s really— okay.
Travis: Heh heh, does that seem high to you, or...?
Griffin: A hundred feet? How high is high? Let’s say a hundred and twenty feet.
Clint: Okay. So they’re up there. I cast Control Weather!
Griffin: What do you do with the weather? Hold on, wait—
Clint: You can— wait, I gotta revel in this!— you take control of the weather within five miles!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Fuck!
Travis: Wait, what the fuck? Hold on!
Clint: Read it and weep, loser!
Justin: It’s, watch, right now I’m calling it—
Travis: This is a Level 8 spell, are you—
Clint: Yes, I know it’s a Level 8— Oh my god, where were they?
[audience cheers]
Clint: Where were they?
Griffin: Oh— Dad has his glasses back.
Justin: Dad has his glasses.
Griffin: It’s Level 8, but because—
Clint: Holy shit, look at all of you!
[Audience cheers]
Clint: Wo-o-o-ow! I just thought it was, like, 8 people making a lot of noise.
Justin: [sarcastically] Play some D&D with your dad. Have some laughs.
Griffin: All right—
Clint: You change the current weather conditions, you can change precipitation, temperature, and wind, so I’m gonna attack the— what’s the most rickety—
Griffin: Okay, this would not be an attack. You can do something and I’ll help you resolve it into something cool, but you’re not rolling, like, an attack.
Clint: Okay. I want there to be… baseball-sized hailstones—
Griffin: Okay, that’s a little TOO real, cuz Dallas is…
Clint: Softball-sized.
Griffin: Let’s, how ‘bout this, some people come here as an escape from the baseball-sized hailstones, so why don’t we—
Clint: How about this, how about if they’re coated with ice, all of them, which means they can’t fly as high-
Travis: Stop, okay—
Clint: And get ‘em within range of us.
Griffin: Uh, it is a sleet storm, and because of this, uh, they are gonna have disadvantage on their, sort of, plane-based actions while they are in the sleet storm. You have de-buffed them permanently. You didn’t crash both fucking planes in the sky, with the one spell you shouldn’t be able to cast—
Clint: [crosstalk] That’s all right! Still, sounds pretty damn competent to me.
Griffin: Sure does.
Clint: [to audience] What do you think?
[Audience cheers]
Clint: Thank you.
Griffin: Taako, you’re up.
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: I also think they come down now, now they’re… 60 feet above you.
Clint: Eh—
Travis: Does that still feel high?
Griffin: Still kinda high— how high is 60 feet? I’m trying to think of a 60-foot-tall dude, and that’s like, pretty tall, yeah? Yeah!
Justin: Wait, they’re 60 feet now?
Griffin: Yeah, they came down.
Travis: Or like twelve 5-foot-tall people.
Justin: Now they’re 60 feet. [tongue pop] I’m gonna cast Mordekainen’s Sword.
Clint: Yea-a-a-a-h!
Justin: Uh, you see Taako extend his hand, and a big sword comes out of it. [Clint laughs] It is a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration. Um, and I’m gonna make a melee spell attack against a target of my choice.
Griffin: You got the dragon, and then you got the big bomber, the big metallic bomber, or sort of the more canvas-y—
Justin: They’ve got disadvantage, yeah?
Griffin: Uh… yeah. On their saves and stuff.
Justin: Perfect.
Clint: Thanks to Merle.
Justin: Thanks to Merle, and his great— oh my god that’s a natural 20!
Griffin: Ohhhh!
[audience cheers]
Clint: Now, for those of you who are listening, his— his thing lit up.
Griffin: That’s true. Yo, we’ve got 20 minutes left we’re supposed to do, you can’t keep insta-killing these planes!
Justin: It’s— this is not gonna insta-kill it, Griffin. It’s just 3d10 force.
[Clint and audience laughs]
Griffin: Well, is it x2 on a crit spell? Yeah, so that’s gonna be 6d10. We gonna do this manually?
Justin: 8. 7.
Griffin: 15...
Travis: 19.
Justin: 19 times 2?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin and Travis: 38.
Griffin: Okay. Yes, okay, okay. And this was on the dragon?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay, and what’s it look like? Describe it with your words.
Justin: It’s, uh…
Griffin: You did TAZ Elementary, I know you know how to paint a picture.
[Audience cheers]
Justin: So it’s, uh, it’s— you just wanted to drink some water— [Griffin: Yup.] it’s a sword... if you’ve ever seen…
Clint: A sword.
Justin: If you’ve ever seen—
Griffin: A Game of Throne, they have, like, everyone’s got em.
Justin: You know how on Thundercats?
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: Ooh.
Justin: It looks like the Sword of Omens. ‘Cuz… they just got Thundercats in this world. And everyone’s really into it.
Griffin: Shit, they—
Travis: They just got there.
Justin: They just got it, and everybody’s super into it.
Griffin: So slash or stab?
Justin: It’s a wall of force, so it, it sort of slashes… through, I guess?
Griffin: Okay, I like that. Uh, all right, I think you—
Justin: It’s force damage, so it’s like—
Travis: You know, if someone hit you with, like, the flat of the blade, just like [impact noise] ow!
Justin: Yeah, it’s basically a spank, a spanking spell.
[Audience laughs]
Justin: A spanking sword, if you will.
Griffin: All right, you hurt this dragon real bad, and with that, it flies down towards you, and it swoops in to sort of intercept you and protect the bomber. And as you eyeball it, you realize that this vehicle has no pilot. It is being controlled remotely somewhere by somebody very skilled.
Travis: Asshole.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: With a flap of what remains of its wings, it pulls ahead and turns to face you, and it has streaks of flame beginning to grow in its mouth. Taako, uh, [to himself] Jesus Christ. And it has disadvantage. Okay, first time I rolled a three. The second time, I swear to Christ, I rolled a one.
[audience laughs]
Justin: [sarcastically] Let me check my sheet, hold on.
Clint: Ohh.
Griffin: Okay, so. It tries to bite at you, and right as it does—
Justin: And its fucking butt falls off?
Griffin: Its jaw, its jaw is like— [creaking squawks], and its jaw just falls completely off, because of the cool slash that you did earlier. Then, with its second attack, uh, that fire—
Travis: Wait, it gets more than one attack?
Griffin: Yeah, imagine that. Its fire, now unimpeded by a second lower jaw shoots out—
Justin: [laughs] Its true form has been realized!
Griffin: —at your vehicle. Everybody make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: But I’m not on the…
Griffin: Oh, you’re right. Magnus is good. Actually, no, it’s shooting at all of them. You are saving for the plane.
Justin: Nineteen plus three, 22?
Griffin: Good.
Travis: I got a twelve. [about Clint] That is a nat 20.
Griffin: Okay, but it is, that is just a save.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: You very save, you extremely save. Uh, Magnus, the fire just gets—
[Audience oohs]
Griffin: Okay, now Dad just knocked a bottle of water off the table and grabbed it. Tonight—
Clint: I’m on FIRE!
Griffin: You are killing it. Okay.
Clint: I am ON FIRE.
Griffin: Magnus, take—
Justin: I’m gonna miss him so much.
Griffin: Magnus, take 32 points of fire damage.
Travis: All right.
Griffin: And also, the left wing of your airplane is on fire.
Travis: Cool.
Griffin: Still flying, on fire, going to be a situation.
Travis: All right.
Clint: You have a harness, Trav.
Griffin: You are next.
Travis: And now I’m down to only 99 hitpoints.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: You are next, Magnus. Don’t fucking lower the stakes for them, they don’t know how many fucking hitpoints you have!
Travis: I do! It’s on my sheet!
Griffin: No, they don’t! I say 36, they’re like “What if he has thirty seven?”
Travis: [laughs] Okay, so my plane is a little on fire, do I— can I control the giant crossbow?
Griffin: Uh, hm. That’s a good question. Actually, because you’re in the middle of a hailstorm, you can but you’ll have disadvantage. Hoo-o-o-o!
Justin: Good job, Dad.
Travis: How close am I to the bomber?
Griffin: Uh, it’s still way up in the sky, it’s a hundred and twenty feet. [recording skip, missing info, probably something along the lines of Travis saying that he wants to fly the skimmer into the dragon] Uh, you could, but you’re going to have to roll really good to fly through this sleet storm—
Travis: Well, I pull out my Stone of Farspeech [makes clicking noise]—
Magnus: [slightly muffled, like talking into a two-way radio] Uh, yeah, uhhhhhhh...
[Griffin laughs]
Magnus: [radio effect] Taako? Uhh…
Griffin: [mockingly, with the same “radio” effect] Come on back here, buddy.
Magnus: Yeah, uh, do you have any plans for the, uhhhhhhhhhh—
[Audience laughs. All continue talking with the ""radio"" effect.]
???: [radio effect] 10-4, back door.
Magnus: —the dragon?
Justin: What?
Griffin [possibly voicing an NPC?]: Hey, sorry, this is [Ger? Jerr?]—
Magnus: Yeah?
Griffin [same possibly npc voice]: Can you say that again? You sound wild—
Justin: You fucking, like, microphones work by putting your voice in them, like—
Travis: [radio effect] Uhhhhhhhhhhh…
Justin: —that’s how I hear you.
Clint: [radio effect] Did you, did you want a large fries with that?
[audience laughs]
Justin: This is hell!
Clint: [still doing the radio effect] —an orange drink. Do you want an orange drink?
Griffin: Are you trying to get the person controlling the dragon to—
Travis: No, I was trying ask Taako what the deal was with the dragon but I’m just going to crash my plane into the dragon.
[Justin laughs]
Griffin: [a bit incredulous] Okay.
Travis: Don’t worry, I’m gonna leap to safety.
[audience laughs]
Clint: In your harness.
Travis: In— no, to the battlewagon.
Justin: And that’s a natural 20.
Clint: Nat 20! Man!
[audience cheers]
Clint: Juice, can you get a picture of that?
Griffin: I think the first thing you see, everybody else in the car, battlewagon, shit. I think all you see— should I wait until after you’re taking a picture in the middle of the podcast that we’re doing or…
Justin: Just a momento, we’re sharing time as a family together.
Griffin: You’re on that table, I don’t get the family time! I have my own family over here on my solo table with my fucking wizard sheet.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: I think, Taako and Merle, you see, through the windshield of the car, you see Magnus just land on the windshield, on the, uh, trunk, just like “Hey, ‘sup?” and then you see his plane, like, a second later just crash into the dragon and explode. And now, uh, both are downed, and—
Travis: And Creed starts to play in the background. Don’t ask why, it just does.
Griffin: Uh, and with that, uh, the—
Travis: And also he lowers his aviators. Or puts them on? What’s cooler? [pause] Puts them on. Puts them on.
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: The bomber overhead readies another salvo of bombs, this time it’s like smaller cluster bombs that you have to dodge out of the way of on the car, and I know that doesn’t make a lot of sense if you think about it, but everyone make a dexterity saving throw.
[Indistinguishable audience shout, supposedly about Griffin saying car]
Travis: Uh, eighteen.
Griffin: Battlewagon, not car, sorry, thank you.
Justin: Uh…
Griffin: But please don’t yell things at the stage.
Justin: Uh, two.
Griffin: Two is bad.
Clint: Seventeen, plus one, eighteen.
Griffin: Uh, okay.
Justin: You’re a dextrous motherfucker tonight, man!
??: [snorts]
Griffin: Uh, yeah, Taako, you get hit by these very small bombs that [breaks into laughter] don’t hit anybody else.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Eyy.
Clint: They’re smart bombs.
Travis: But you do have that extra AC, does that help?
Justin: That does help!
[Clint cackles triumphantly]
Griffin: It doesn’t, it was a saving throw, it doesn’t help, it doesn’t help.
Justin: [crosstalk] But I rolled a two, so it doesn’t help at all.
Clint: Aw.
Griffin: It’s just 11 points of damage.
Justin: How many?
Griffin: Eleven.
Justin: Alright.
Griffin: Okay, here’s what happens. Taako, did I tell you how much damage you would take? Yes, did that. Uh, I think the bomber overhead starts to ready another salvo, and you hear Hurley, she’s got her own Stone of Farspeech— Carspeech? If it was a car, that would be good.
Travis: There’s something there.
Clint: That’s the show with the two brothers, right?
Justin: It’s her Stone of Battlewagon-speech.
Griffin: It’s her Stone of Battlewagon-speech, and she pulls it out and says, um.
Hurley: Hey, babe, can you do the thing?
Griffin: And then we see Sloane, in the press box, kinda sigh. And then the wood that composes her body, she, like, claps her hands together and it starts to glow, and then from the ground immediately in front of your battlewagon, roots start to grow up to form a sick ramp.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: And right when your car is about to hit it, Hurley flips up a latch on the stick shift and presses a button, and the horns on the ram on the front of the car turn backwards and ignite, sweet NOS. And your wagon goes flying upward into the air in the direction of the bomber.
Clint: Autobots, transform!
Griffin: And it sails over the wing of the bomber, and Hurley says—
Hurley: Get out, get out, get out, get out! Get out, get out, get out!
Magnus: Okay.
Travis: And Magnus does.
Justin: I get out, I guess…
Griffin: Okay—
Clint: Sure.
Griffin: —and you land on the wing of the bomber for the climactic boss fight! And her car keeps on going over the wing, and you see her inside like—
Hurley: Uh oh, shit!
Griffin: —and she goes sailing back towards the ground. But she’s fine, ‘cause she has the magic harness.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: You actually see her jump out and her bubble deploys and she falls safely, but her car explodes as it hits the ground.
[audience groans]
Griffin: But she’s cool.
Travis: She’s fine.
Griffin: And now you are on the wing of the bomber, and you land, and see where I am in the notes.
Justin: Hmm.
Griffin: You’re on the wings of the bomber, which have a span of nearly twenty feet, equipped with four propellers that drag the vessel through the sky. On the front of the plane you see a cockpit hatch protruding, heavily reinforced by the look of it, and inside you see the dwarf you encountered earlier, Alfred D’Gaul, piloting the vessel. He doesn’t seem to have noticed that you’re there—
Travis: He’s a halfling.
Griffin: Was he?
Justin: He’s a halfling, yeah.
Griffin: [to audience] Was he?
[audience cheers in agreement]
Griffin: Oooh-kay!
[Travis laughs]
Griffin: Oops! You see the halfling, and it’s Alfred D’Gaul, and he doesn’t notice you’re there, but his mobility behind him is limited and he’s trying to contact his companions, but to no avail. What do you do? [pause] We are out of initiative.
Justin: Uh, is he in the race?
Griffin: Uh, the race has kinda sorta become a little confusing at this point.
Justin: [dejected] I really did want to win the race. [pause] Do you feel like we won?
[audience laughs]
Clint: There is a lot of money at stake.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: You said a hundred thousand gold.
Griffin: [a bit sarcastically] Twenty million gold, yeah.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: I never thought the three of you, sneaking up on an unarmed unaware enemy, would lead to such fucking pause.
Clint: Merle casts Death Ward!
Justin: What?
Clint: Well, you’re just sitting there on your ass, not doing anything!
Griffin: Somebody, do something, what’s going on?!
Justin: Dad cast a weird spell, so tell us all about it, Mac.
Clint: Well, the first time [crosstalk] you—
Justin: Yeah? [crosstalk] Cast it? Is now.
Clint: —the target would drop to zero hitpoints as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to one hitpoint and the spell ends.
Justin: Are you protecting him?
Clint: What I’m—
Travis: Here’s the thing, I was going to stab him, and then Dad was like “I’m gonna kill him with a spell!” but the spell saves his life.
Griffin: Dad cast a healing spell on him, so again, I’m going to ask. Everything okay over at that table? Y’all having family discussions over on that table so I don’t know if there’s some sort of drama going on, I don’t know if you all got stung with the same bee, and it’s making your brains not work anymore.
Travis: Maybe Merle’s going through his canon spell cards. And Magnus just goes “Hold on,” and just stabs the dude.
Griffin: Okay—
Clint: Do I have to do anything to make this spell happen? Don’t I have to roll?
Griffin: [laughs] We have not played Dungeons & Dragons in so fucking long!
Clint: Here!
Travis: Your spell—
Griffin: [sounding panicked and exasperated] What are you rolling to do?!
[audience & Justin laugh]
Griffin: [in the same frantic tone] The fucking cockpit opens up, he— [struggles for words] it’s been eight minutes! He fucking looks behind him. “How long have you been there?” “Eight minutes.” He gets out of the cockpit—
[Justin laughs]
Travis: A, a 24 versus AC for a sneak attack?
Griffin: He steps out— nope it’s too late— you reach back to attack but he’s been standing there for five minutes, ‘cause you’ve been standing there for eighteen minutes doing fucking nothing!
[Justin breaks down again]
Griffin: There’s a million people here! No, Alfred gets out, and he says, uh
Alfred: I see you’ve taken out my companions, but you don’t seem to get it. I already won. Your race won’t be finished, the fans will be upset, and the next time they want to go out for some entertainment, what are they gonna think about? These big, cool skywagons dogfighting in the clouds! You should have taken my off— well, I guess you did take my offer, but you should have followed through with my offer, fellas.
Magnus: Here’s what you don’t know. I bet your ten thousand gold on this exact outcome. And then I’m gonna use that money to buy the Blazing Wings! It was a million to one odds that this exact outcome would play out. It is also the plot of Dodgeball.
Alfred: I love that flick. Fantasy Ben Stiller.
Taako: So what is it about, what is it about Blazing Wings, the planes that explode, you think is going to drive in the crowds?
Alfred: Folks love cool plane stunts
Taako: [crosstalk] Damn, you’re right, okay, as soon as I said it I realized.
Alfred: Yeah, did you hear what you said?
Taako: Yeah, it’s very cool.
Alfred: And that’s why I think, listen, the whole Blaze Wings thing is pretty dope, if you really think about what they are.
Taako: Yeah, it’s very good.
Alfred: So anyways—
Magnus: It’s a real challenge.
Alfred: —I’ve foiled everything and I guess—
Taako: Wait! There’s one thing that, um, could foil you. What if somebody won the race?
Alfred: There’s no way, it’s done—
Justin: And Taako jumps out of the plane.
[audience cheers]
Justin: And on the way down to the ground, he casts Phantom Steed!
[cheers grow louder]
Griffin: What’s, uh, what’s the suspension like on those binicorn legs?
Justin: Um, it’s pretty good, considering that I have an umbrella that always has Feather Fall that I can cast for free.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Do you still have that?
Travis: They crafted another one in the last six months.
Griffin: Okay, fine.
Justin: Thank you.
Griffin: So let’s finish the plane business first as you are sailing towards the ground.
Justin: Yes.
Griffin: Magnus and Merle, what do you do?
Justin: Yes!
Griffin: Are you going to let Taako win the race?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay. That’s very big of you.
Magnus: I bet on this exact outcome!
Griffin: Yeah, okay. Okay, I think, D’Gaul runs back towards the cockpit—
Travis: I throw the Chance Lance.
Griffin: Okay. No, it’s gone, he’s not going to bring it out now, Paul’s got other jobs to do other than run out here and brings us cups of pencils and spears and things.
Travis: It’s a 25.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Wait, you rolled a 25?
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: Man.
Clint: That sounds like one of my rolls.
[audience laughs]
Travis: Uh, six?
Griffin: Yeah, not great, However—
Justin: Chance Lance is a little rusty from disuse, it seems.
Griffin: It hits him, and he kind of steps backwards, and he’s like [chuckles], and then as you recall it out of him, he sort of overcompensates his step and he goes backwards into one of the propellers. Um. [audience cheers] But! [laughs] As his particles fly through the air, they sort of give a thumbs-up. [audience cheers] “I’m good.” And then that propeller explodes. And then he’s still pretty good. But now the plane you’re standing on is starting to go down.
Magnus: Eh.
Griffin: And this is how they die!
Travis: I’ve got a harness!
Griffin: Okay, you just fucking ride it, fucking ride it to the ground?
Travis: Yeah, fuck it.
Justin: Hell yeah!
Travis: I hug Merle one last time.
Griffin: So you’re just Thelma-and-Louise-ing it? Okay. Yeah. You both go down together. Here’s the scene. Taako, you hit the ground with Garyl, and you’re just cool.
Garyl: What’s up, we racing?
Griffin: I think the audience is kinda confused about what’s happening, they're not really sure what they just watched, they thought—
Justin: This audience? Or—
Griffin: This audience.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: They’re not really sure what they watched, they thought it was going to be a race, and then some planes from some competing leagues started to show up, and then tried to blow everything up. But you hear some yelling from the sidelines, the other racers realize what’s going on, and they’re all pointing to the finish line, which is right in front of you.
Justin: I tell Garyl, “If you go fast tonight, I’ll give you some oats.” I whisper in his ear [crosstalk] and he’s like—
Clint: [crosstalk] Ghosty oats.
Justin: And he’s like—
Garyl: Spectral oats?
Justin: And I’m like—
Taako: You know it.
Justin: And then he goes faster, than the other… people? I don’t know if we’re racing, I can just say he’s faster than the other ones and he wins the race?
Griffin: I think, as you’re running down the track, there are no other battlewagons—
Justin: Oh, yeah!
Griffin: —which means the audience has been down on the racetrack level for a few minutes, the thirty minutes you spent up there not doing anything—
Justin: Then Taako stands up in the stirrups and raises his hands, like hey, this is the show.
Griffin: And now the audience is losing it.
Justin: Racing is still alive!
Griffin: The audience—
Justin: He casts Prismatic Spray, and like, colors shooting out of his hands, it’s an amazing spectacle! This is what racing is all about!
Griffin: And right as you cross the finish line, the bomber crashes to the ground behind you—
[Justin laughs triumphantly]
Griffin: —in a massive explosion.
Justin: Hell yeah!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: And confetti shoots up from the pylons, and Hurley and Sloane run towards you with the Turbo Platinum Cup, and all the other racers run out, cheering. You saved their league and put on an amazing show.
Travis: [crosstalk] And Merle— Merle and Magnus are totally fine.
Griffin: And Merle and Magnus, from the flaming wreckage— do you look back to see if your friends are okay?
Justin: I don’t.
Clint: No.
[Griffin laughs]
Clint: Noooo.
Griffin: Well, for whoever is looking, from the flaming wreckage, we see the hands of Merle and Magnus stick out two big, gross thumbs up.
Justin: But Taako didn’t see that, because he didn’t look—
Griffin: No, he’s totally good.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: And that’s the episode!
Justin: Hey folks!
Griffin: Thank you all so much for coming! Uh, we’ll see whoever’s gonna be here tomorrow for MBMBAM, and... Bye!

Announcer: Before presenting you with our tale of high adventure, I have a deadly important question for you, Nashville. Are you tres horny for this one? It’s The Adventure Zone!
[THEME MUSIC: ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson]
[Audience cheers wildly]
Travis: And now it’s time to switch to my prescription glasses.
Justin: Always the most exciting, hard-core moment [indecipherable].
Travis: Rock star!
Griffin: [sheepish] Hey everybody.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Whew!
Griffin: Before we get going, is there any way we can get full house lights and- so we can see all the cosplay? Because we’ve only been following it through Twitter, and— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, lights up. If you are doing cosplay, stand up!
[audience cheers]
Clint: God!
Griffin: It’s everybody. It’s everyone.
Travis: Holy shit!
Griffin: Holy shit.
Justin: So good. [Travis laughs wildly] Y’all are… off the chain.
[audience cheering]
Travis: Keep going!
Justin: So good.
Clint: Aww!
Justin: So good.
[audience cheers]
Clint: Ohhh!
Justin: There’s one person here dressed like Naruto [pronounced Nuh-roo-doh, all say it the same way], and like I get it, but could you not? It’s kind of our…[crosstalk] thing…
Griffin: [crosstalk] Please dress like Naruto! Don’t Naruto-shame them!
Justin: Also, is Naruto a character, or is… [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh no!
Griffin: [crosstalk] No one’s quite sure. Uh...
Travis: I also don’t know!
Justin: [crosstalk] I don’t know the answer.
Clint: [crosstalk] It’s a state of mind.
Griffin: You can turn the lights down now, I’m having a panic attack. And there they go, there they go, there they go… [crosstalk] and they don’t exist, it’s just the four of us!
Justin: [crosstalk] They’re gone, they’re gone. It’s just us four.
[audience laughs]
Justin: Who’s laughing? I don’t know.
Travis: Whew!
Justin: Uh, how do we…
Travis: Could you turn ‘em off on stage, too? [Justin & Griffin laugh] Just make it a super chill night?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Uh, y’all wanna-
Travis: [movie trailer voice] In the beginning…
Griffin: Y’all wanna just get, get, get going, get into it? It’s been about two months since we’ve played Dungeons and Dragons, so this should be interesting.
{5:16}
[audience cheers]
Clint: What’s my password on this? [his phone; audience laughs]
Griffin: Holy shiiiiiiiiiitt.
Travis: No! No! Don’t laugh for that! [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Laugh at it!
Travis: He knows his password!
Clint: Listen, this is America, you can laugh at any shit [crosstalk] you wanna laugh at!
Travis: [crosstalk] No!
Griffin: Gettin’-
Travis: Also! Also no.
Griffin: Still no. Did you— did you s— solve the password puzzle over there? Are we good?
Clint: I solv— I’m good.
Griffin: Alright. Uh, let’s get going. Y’all ready?
Justin: I don’t have… the one with 20…
Griffin: Are you fucking kidding me?
Travis: You have two giant ones— [crosstalk]
Justin: The big ones! Ok, the big ones, yeah, thes- deez nuts right here. These- [crosstalk] are twenties.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Travis do you have a joke you wanna do [crosstalk] about being unprepared?
Travis: [crosstalk] No! I am prepared and a good good D&D boy!
Griffin: Good.
Justin: There are some though—
[audience cheers]
Justin: Legit, and this should add some fun tension, there are some I don’t have, and I don’t know exactly [crosstalk] off the top of my head.
Travis: [crosstalk] I got extries.
Justin: Ok.
Griffin: Trav’s got a bunch. Alright! Let’s do it.
Justin: Ok… [pause] D4, for example…
Griffin: Yeah. It’s a—
Travis: I got— Oh! Shit! I don’t have that.
Griffin: Holy shit!
Clint: I got a four! I got up a four! I got a four!
Justin: [crosstalk] I just found a D4!
Travis: [crosstalk] Ok, you’ve got a D4...
Clint: [crosstalk] The one with 20 sides...
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s mine! Wait that’s my D4!
Justin: Ok this is Travis’s D4, but we’re kinda sharing it.
Griffin: This is gonna be the whole episode.
Justin: Joint custody D4.
Travis: Before we walked out, Griffin said “no jokes about not knowing how to play the game, we have a lotta story to get to,” so I wanna clarify: none of this has been jokes.
Griffin: Good.
Travis: Not a joke in the b— in the—
Clint: Should we introduce ourselves?
Griffin: Sure, yeah. I— yeah, sure. Who has not listened to The Adventure Zone before?
[audience is almost silent, a few cheers]
Griffin: Alright, yeah...
Travis: I heard one lonely, [crosstalk] single—
Clint: [crosstalk] What the hell are you doing here?
Griffin: No, don’t— don’t Naruto-shame them. Justin, who are you playing today?
Justin: Uh, my name is Justin McElroy and I play the elven wizard Taako.
[audience cheers]
Travis: Uh, I am Travis McElroy and I play the human fighter Magnus Burnsides.
[audience cheers]
Clint: And I am Clint McElroy, and I play dwarven cleric Merle Highchurch.
[audience cheers]
Clint: And I have never gotten that right in a live [crosstalk] show.
Griffin: [crosstalk] You— I thought for sure you were gonna fuck it up. I’m Griffin McElroy, I play everybody else. That’s Paul—
[audience cheers]
Clint: Aww!
Travis: Dice!
Clint: Aww!
Griffin: Paul came out here with two dice bags—
Travis: Yeah, yeah!
Griffin: Oh, and a ‘great job’ pump. My hero, and yours, Paul. Let’s do the adventure!
Travis: Be careful! Because in there is an actual ring of mine from my baby’s birth. Please don’t lose that.
Justin: I don’t—
Travis: It’s not a joke!
Justin: Y’know, I’ll just make up a number then. Like, what are you doing? You can’t just put that kind of pressure on me. All right—
{7:51}
Griffin: THE THREE OF YOU! [audience laughs] Are we ready?
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I see a lot of fiddlin’ and fartin’ around!
Justin: ‘Kay.
Griffin: I’m just gonna start talkin’. The three of you are sitting in stylish, high-backed chairs in front of… a blackjack table. Sitting—
[audience ‘oooh’s]
Griffin: ‘Oooooh’! Sitting across from you is a dealer, a half-ogre gentleman dressed to the nines with a bright red vest and a nametag on it that says “Crush.” [audience laughs] This scene is in the middle of an enormous casino pit, and all around you other folks are playing table games - craps, poker, roulette - while others sit at seemingly-endless rows of slot machines, dumping buckets of gold coins into them all night.
Clint: Baccarat? Is there Baccarat?
Griffin: There’s definitely...not Baccarat.
Travis: Is there Burt Bacharach?
Griffin: There is, yes. Fantasy Burt Bacharach. Uh, the three of you are also dressed to the nines. What are you wearing for this stylish casino atmosphere?
[audience cheers]
Travis: Sleeveless tuxedo.
[audience laughs]
Clint: Tuxedo sleeves.
[audience laughs]
Travis: We only had the money for the one!
[audience laughs]
Justin: Uh, I had to choose between formal, business-casual, and Taako, and I went ahead and went with Taako.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Justin: Also but I did get the Cloak of the Manta Ray, cuz I figured eventually—
Griffin: Show that off, by the way? Somebody just sent you the Cloak of the Manta Ray and it’s so fucking tight—
[audience cheers]
Griffin: It’s super good. Alright, so—
Travis: Now Dad, show off your swim trunks!
Griffin: Dad’s just wearing swim trunks with his costume.
[Griffin & audience laugh]
Justin: Swim trunks— swim trunks that he forgot, and made someone go back to the hotel to get for him, and we’re all like ‘oh these pants that we’re hearing about, these are gonna be [crosstalk] outta sight, like so fresh”...
Griffin: [crosstalk] So dope.
Justin: They are.
Clint: Beach. Dwarf.
Griffin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Travis: [overlapping] No, it tracks!
Justin: [overlapping] No no no, we get it, yeah yeah yeah—
Travis: It tracks! But I wasn’t expecting swim trunks. When they brought them in, I thought you would say ‘oh this is embarrassing, but you’re gonna have to go back’—
Clint: They’re actually board… trunks… Am I right?
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: B-O-R-E-D, ‘cuz we’re talking about it too much!
Griffin: Yeah, instead of doin’ the podcast! So the three of you have been sittin’ at this blackjack table for a while, uh, how— how has your game been going? Any of you particularly—
Travis: Magnus bets wildly and poorly.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: He doubles-down on like, thirteen. Not a good call.
{10:16}
Griffin: Crush— Crush, sitting opposite you, the dealer, says
Crush: You boys havin’ a good time? Old Blue Eyes makes sure that everyone has a good time in his place.
Magnus: Are you— are you [high-pitched] Old Blue Eyes?
Griffin: He points to his nametag.
Crush: I’m Crush. I—
Taako: You can forgive us for assuming that you were trying to get some sort of name, nickname going, I mean—
Magnus: Yeah!
Crush: Old— Old Blue Eyes runs the joint. You’re coming here and you don’t know who Old Blue Eyes is?
Clint: Sinatra!
Crush: Who?
Travis: Oh-kay!
Justin: Cool. You did— you [Griffin] created that trap and you [Clint] did walk into it [crosstalk] so that was kind of a duo—
Clint: [crosstalk] Aww!
Griffin: While you’ve been playing, you’ve also been on edge, because you’re waiting for something to happen. The table you’re at [crosstalk] is-
Travis: [crosstalk] In our lives!
Griffin: The table you’re at is 20 feet from a guarded door into the casino back room where two half-ogre pit bosses are watching the room and your table in particular. And you hear them also exchange words about Old Blue Eyes. One of them says they heard he’s actually in the building tonight, which is apparently—
Travis: At what age do you think he becomes Old Blue Eyes? Cuz that’s gotta be hurtful, right, where it’s like “I’m Blue Eyes!”, and it’s like “Hey it’s Old Blue Eyes!”, “Ahh…”
Griffin: Uh, and the three of you have been exchanging these sort of furtive glances all evening, waiting for a signal for the next part of your plan to begin. And, it’s during one of those glances that you’re interrupted, Taako, as you feel a hand on your shoulder as someone moves to your side, and you hear a voice say,
Woman’s Voice: Is this seat taken?
[audience cheers]
Taako: Uh, no, no, Ma’am-Who-Is-A-Stranger-To-Me! By all means!
Griffin: And there, wearing a sharp, flashy, black ensemble and wide-brimmed hat… is your twin sister Lup.
[audience cheers]
Travis: I also wanna say, bold choice with the stranger thing, you do look—
Clint: Exactly alike.
Griffin: You are twins.
Clint: You’re twins.
Griffin: You see Lup, who nods at all three of you with a devious smile, and then we see all four of you as the camera pans out, showing the scope of this enormous gaming hall, and then it zooms out even further to show us the exterior of this opulent casino, and a steady crowd is pouring in as flood lights shine into the sky over [{12:37} “Doing Some Crime” starts] a bright neon sign showcasing the name of this establishment:
“The Grand Grimaldis Casino”
[audience erupts, music continues]
Clint: Played by Al Pacino!
Griffin: No.
Justin: No.
Griffin: We’re in a flashback to several nights ago. The three of you are sitting at a round table where crudely-drawn blueprints of the casino are rolled out. And as you’re surveying the designs, four belts equipped with some sort of mechanical device thunk down on the table and Lup joins you. Can you turn down the pump-up music a little bit? It’s a little assertive.
Lup says,
Lup: I’ve brought you here today because I’ve got some unfinished business back in our home world that needs taken care of.
[audience cheers]
Lup: When I was younger, before I discovered how rad explosion magic can be, I used to dabble in Transmutation magic, and during that period, I created something powerful. An artifact that could self-replicate, giving its owner an endless hoard of cash over time. A magically-imbued fifteen-dollar bill.
[audience cheers]
Lup: It was taken from me by Greg-fuckin’-Grimaldis just— just before our exit from that world. I aim to get it back. Now, he’s used that seed money to become an infinitely wealthy warlord in our homeworld, and the base of his operation is this: The Grand Grimaldis Casino. I need the three of you to help me infiltrate that casino and retrieve and destroy the fifteen-dollar bills. So, anyone up for a proper casino heist?
Magnus: Yay!
Merle: Yeah!
[audience cheers]
Travis: Uh, I’m going to have to look to my moral guide, Merle Highchurch—
Magnus: If we commit a crime, in a different plane, does it count?
Merle: M-maybe? It depends, does—
Justin: Stop.
Merle: Does Greg—
Justin: No, stop. Are you saying this to him as Clinton McElroy, my father, or are you saying this to him as Merle Highchurch, popular fantasy cleric?
Clint: Oh, God.
Justin: These people paid a lot of fuckin’ money, and they didn’t come here to hear you, be you, when you’re you— not you.
Clint: Please, forgive me, paying public.
Merle: I say Grimaldis is a prick.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Lup goes on and says,
Lup: Since we took down The Hunger, the barrier between realities has become impermeable, but with these belts, we’ll be able to enter that reality for as long as they remain charged, which should give us a narrow eighty-minute window to get in, and get the artifact.
Travis: [laughs] About live-show length!
Lup: It is imperative that we don’t get caught, or we’ll lose precious time in the process. Now, the first challenge is gonna be—
Magnus: Oh shit, a stealth mission! [unsure sounds]
Taako: You’ve come to the right people!
Lup: Most— most heists are…
Travis: Oh wait! This is post-rogue training!
Griffin: Yeah you’re good. Uh,
Lup: Now the first challenge is gonna be breaking into the back rooms of the casino from the gaming pit. The three of you will sit here, at this blackjack table closest to the door to these back rooms. I’ll do a couple laps around the pit to make sure there’s no surprises waiting for us there, then join you for our assault. Now, that door is likely to be heavily guarded, so, before we’ll be able to make our way into the employee-only area, we’ll probably have to create a distraction.
Magnus: Done!
Lup: Following that, the four of us will slip inside unnoticed. Any questions?
[beat of total silence]
Lup: Cool!
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh, and I guess we’ve flashed forward back to the present. Lup winks and it’s time for the heist to begin, but like she said, before you can move into the back rooms, you need to create a distraction. What do you dooo, herooooooeeeessssssss?
Travis: I stand up— or [mumbling] Magnus stands up, I’m not Magnus— and points at Crush and goes,
Magnus: He’s bottom dealing!
Justin: Ooh, good.
Griffin: Ooh, that is good. Roll a Deception check, cause you’re—
Travis: [crosstalk] Well that ain’t good.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: That’s a seven plus one, an eight.
Griffin: No.
[audience laughs]
Travis: Just kidding!
Griffin: One of the two pit bosses comes over from the door that you’re supposed to get through, and walks over and says
Pit Boss: Crush, what seems to be the problem here?
Griffin: And Crush says
Crush: Well… Slam, I—
[audience laughs]
Crush: This guy’s causing a big stink, I don’t know why, [begins to sob] I’m doin’ my best. I’m doin’ my best.
Travis: I’m— I’m gonna try a second tactic here.
Magnus: [super drunkenly] I-I charge this— he’s now— he’s bottom dealing! Hiccup! Hiccup!
Crush: He suddenly got super fake-drunk all of a—
Magnus: [sounds of protestation] I’m totally drunk!
Griffin: I guess make another Deception check.
Travis: That’s an eighteen plus one, nineteen.
[audience cheers]
Travis: I throw up on myself to make it a little more convincing.
Griffin: Yeah, I think with a nineteen, you fake-drunk so good you just barf. What’s the game plan here, Travis McElroy?
Travis: Well, my hope is that my two friends will try to drag me away cause I’m clearly drunk, and I can create a ruckus.
Griffin: Alright we’re gonna flashback again, and you are relaying that to those two.
Magnus: Yeah, I’m gonna fake-drunk—
Griffin: Lup says,
Lup: I don’t think this is gonna work.
Magnus: No, I’ll create a big hubbub by being like fake-drunk and then you guys come and get me all—
Merle: Yeah but if we help you off, there’s nobody left to take advantage of—
Magnus: I’ll flip the table so that they have to like, clean it up. And there’s gonna be chips everywhere and money everywhere.
Taako: I— I do want to say I’m so glad you decided to, uh, throw yourself a UCB Harold show when I can set things on fire with my mind. This is literally the path of least resistance, this fuckin’ Second City skit you’ve-
Griffin: [crosstalk] I think— I think we’ve, uh—
Taako: [crosstalk] -you’ve written.
Griffin: I think we are flashed forward back to the— back to the heist, and uh, Taako, seeing sort of the clumsy attempt that Magnus has—
Travis: [indignant] Clumsy? I rolled it and I got a nineteen!
Griffin: You did alright. Uh, Taako. What are you— what do you do to create a distraction?
Justin: Uh, I, uh— [laughs] I literally have a spell called Programmed Illusion that I set just for this, when this—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay.
Justin: When this failed, uh, it is—
Travis: [insistent] Nineteen!
Justin: Sorry?
Travis: [indignant] Nineteen, I rolled a nineteen and it failed!
[audience laughs]
Clint: That was to puke on yourself, and you—
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, and I puked real good!
Clint: You did it—
Travis: I puked super good!
Clint: You did it, didn’t he, guys? Didn’t he puke like a big boy?
[audience cheers]
Travis: I puked sooo good, like, it did, like, spirals!
Griffin: What is your programmed illusion?
Justin: It’s uh, their boss…
Griffin: Old Blue Eyes?
Justin: Old Blue Eyes, and he says,
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: I’m very convinced by this puking!
Justin: And they— that’s what he says.
Griffin: [laughing, incredulous] Does he just appear?
Justin: [crosstalk] No!
Clint: [mimicking Illusory Old Blue Eyes] I just had new felt put on these tables!
Justin: He comes out of a co— he comes out of the crowd, and he’s like— cause they were watching the puking—
Griffin: Okay, okay, okay, yeah that works.
Justin: And he like comes out of the crowd, he’s like
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: I’m very convinced by this puking!
Griffin: Alright, this uh, this illusory… dude… with bright blue eyes and jet-black hair, uh, walks through the crowd and says:
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: Yeah let’s uh, let’s—
Griffin: Wait, what does he sound like? I don’t know, cause I wasn’t expecting him this early.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: He says, uh,
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: Oh man, we can’t have a guy like this in the— in the crowd with yartz all over him, what uh… let’s take care of this, huh?
Griffin: Actually, you should talk for your illusory dude you made, probably not me.
Justin: Yeah, but I don’t know what he sounds like.
Griffin: I think I like that! I think then— you don’t know what he sounds like!
[audience laughs]
Justin: Okay, that’s going to be confusing for you folks out there, but let’s give it a shot.
Clint: Character voice!
[audience cheers]
Justin: What are you talk— [to the audience] no, don’t, no, no, no, no, no, no. When he goes astray, it’s not your job to reinforce that. Your job is to be there when he falls and help pick him back up and—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Alright.
Justin: —sometimes that’s accomplished through silence. Um, no I wasn’t doing a character voice, I was just trying to be Justin McElroy, and I think that, uh… I, I mean it’s like… [snorts]
[audience laughs]
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: [stereotypical Italian mobster from Brooklyn accent] Ay, I’m r-really convinced by ah, this guy’s pukin’, ah… over here…
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Roll a, roll a Deception check.
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: Booshk!
Griffin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, roll a Deception check with one of the big ones.
Justin: That’s a natural twenty.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, that’s flat—
Clint: [crosstalk] God! Did it light up?
Travis: Every— everyone in the building goes—
Clint: Did it light up?
Travis: It did.
Justin: Yeah, it’s flashing, it’s flashing, as you can attest.
Clint: [cackles]
Griffin: Uh, alright, I— I think Crush says,
Crush: Boss, you sound sick, but it’s definitely you.
Justin: Haha!
Griffin: I think with a twenty, you actually—
Travis: Does it just keep flashing?
Griffin: I think with a twenty, you just changed what Greg Grimaldis’s actual voice sounds like.
Justin: Okay, good. S’about right.
Griffin: Uh, okay, they have bought into it, and now you have this illusory Greg Grimaldis that everybody’s kind of paying deference to. What’s the next step in this wild plan you’ve concocted?
Justin: Where are we trying to get to?
Griffin: Uh, this door that these two, uh, half-ogres are— were guarding, one of them peeled off to investigate the loud—
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: Hey, listen! I don’t pay you guys to not get mops when people throw up! Go get the mops!
Griffin: Uh, alright, Crush, Slam, and the third half-ogre [crosstalk], who are all—
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: Hey and listen, Bump, get the real nice mops that we keep farther away.
[Griffin and the audience laugh]
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: The real choice mops—
Travis: [crosstalk] The special occasion mops!
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: The real nice, choice mops!
Travis: [crosstalk] The holiday mops!
Illusory Old Blue Eyes: The company mops, y’know?
Griffin: Lup says—
Travis: [crosstalk] For when whales puke!
Griffin: Lup says,
Lup: I can’t wait to see these excellent mops!
Griffin: Oh that’s right.
Merle: Listen. I’ve gotta get him to a place where he can lay down, so that if he pukes, he chokes.
Crush???: You’re a st—
Justin: [crosstalk] They’re gone.
Crush???: You’re a stranger here [Griffin laughing], all right, this isn’t your house, it’s a—
Merle: I’m a trained professional.
Crush???: [relenting] Okaay.
Griffin: Uh, alright, I think the half-ogres are pulled away and you are— the four of you are here with this illusory dude—
Travis: We do— we do that, we go through the— we go through the door.
Griffin: Okay! The— the four of you walk through this back door. What happens with your— I think your illusory Greg Grimaldis— I’m going to— it just evaporates because otherwise this heist is gonna be very, very easy.
Justin: Yeah, he died, it was a short-term kinda thing.
Griffin: Alright, the four of you make it through the door into the back rooms and, uh, the door shuts behind you. And I think as— as, uh, as you do, you hear this, like, sparking sound? And you turn around to see Lup, and she has her finger out, and it’s almost like she’s trying to light a uh, uh, what are those things that people—
Travis: Acetylene torch?
Griffin: Uh yeah, torch, but with her finger? And she, like, fuses the lock shut so nobody else can follow you in.
Travis: Magnus rips his, uh, vomit-y tuxedo off. Now he’s just shirtlesssss.
[audience cheers]
Travis: And there’s lots of beautiful scars.
Griffin: Sssuuurrreee?
Travis: And a Loch Ness Monster tattoo, very similar to the one I have.
Griffin: Uh, we’re back in the flashback to a few nights ago, and Lup, uh, directs your attention to the blueprints, which show the back rooms behind the gaming pit, your second destination for the heist, and she says,
Lup: Once we make it past the pit, we’ll need to work our way past the security station in the back hallways, and toward the vault in the center of the casino. Now, hopefully, at this point we won’t have the whole place on top of us, which should make it easy to slip past the security station’s, uh, large glass window looking into that hallway, and towards the vault entrance around the corner. So long as we stay out of their sightlines, we should be in the clear.
Griffin: And we are back in the present, and sure enough the four of you are standing in a, uh, a long hallway extending 40 feet in front of you before it reaches a corner that veers off to the right. And on the left side of this hallway, there’s an entrance into the casino’s main security office, and just past that door is a 15-foot-long, floor-to-ceiling glass divider leading into that office. And inside you can hear several deep voices trying to communicate with security forces at various points in the casino, you hear several, uh, heated discussions with the crew in the pit who are dealing with the, the mess you left behind. By the way, I put that in the notes, knowing that there would some sort of literal mess.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: In order to proceed down this hallway, you need to get past that window without being detected. What do you do?
Clint: I cast Insect Plague.
Griffin: Fuck.
Justin: Fuck, that’s so s—
Travis: No, that’s the opposite!
Griffin: No no no no no!
Justin: No. I cast Silence.
Griffin: No no no no no. [crosstalk] You do not.
Travis: [crosstalk] I cast ‘Punch Dad’.
Griffin: Order of operations. Dad’s pulling a Fargo and I wanna see how it goes. You cast an Insect Plague—
Clint: Insect Plague.
Griffin: [singsong] Wherrrrrrrrrrrree?
Clint: Over the windowwwww…
Griffin: What the fuck?
[audience laughs]
Travis: ‘Eyy, it’s another one of those Insect Plagues’ [crosstalk]
Justin: ‘Ah, god dammit!’
Travis: ‘So normal at this point, I don’t even have to go check it!’
Clint: They’re not gonna come in! They’ll stay in the—
Griffin: They’ll come outside! It’s a—
Clint: Why!? It’s insects, it’s a plague, who would wanna walk into that willingly? [Justin laughs] ‘Ooooooh, insects! Let’s stay in here until they go away!’
Travis: Once again, I do wanna point out, I was like ‘oh, I’ll create a distraction’ and Dad’s like ‘I’ll create a thing!’ when we have an illusion wizard.
Griffin: No, we gotta spread the fun arouuuund.
Justin: Yeah. I wa—
Clint: What do I roll? A twenty?
Justin: I, actually, while this was happening, like, turned invisible— let me mark down my spell sheet— and walked to the other end of the hall. And I’m just kinda, like, enjoying—
Griffin: And Lup’s— Lup’s already over there, she, like—
Travis: I’m also gonna roll a Stealth check ‘cuz I have, lemme check, plus 11.
Justin: We’re seeing if there’s any rare Pokémon here— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] So, I mean, it’s a 15. It’s a 4 but I have a plus 11.
Griffin: Yeah, Magnus makes himself small and just rolls along along the length of the window, and leaving Merle, uh, and you [crosstalk] and bugs—
Clint: [crosstalk] Okay!
Justin: [overlapping] Just start channelling bugs at the window!
Travis: [overlapping] Like the fucking, like, Mummy!
Clint: [overlapping] Bugs! Are all f— covering the window...
Justin: Can they come out of his mouth? I’m sure they did.
[Justin & Travis mimic spewing bugs, a la the Hom-Dai in ‘The Mummy’]
Clint: So do I roll? [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Sneaky!
Travis: Brendan Fraser looks on from the glass window, terrified.
Clint: So I roll a 20, right?
[a small tap sound as Clint attempts to drop a D20 in his dice tower]
Clint: Doesn’t fit!
Griffin: [laughing] [overlapping] It got stuck in the dice tower!
Justin: [overlapping] It’s stuck in his dice tower.
Griffin: Your big dice got stuck in the tower!
Travis: Also, thanks to whoever made these, didn’t look the name up, we’ll know it after intermission.
Griffin: Sorry about that! It got stuck in the tower, though, that’s fantastic.
Justin: Okay.
Clint: Okay, so, how ‘bout if enough— [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] If— what is it? What’s the dice?
Clint: Seven.
Griffin: Je-sus!
Clint: Okay. And I add that to my modifier.
Justin: Okay. And what’s that, off the top of your head?
Clint: [whispered] Shit… eight! My modifier is eight! So it’s fifteen.
Justin: People who know more about D&D, does that sound like a thing? Eight?
Clint: Yeah.
Justin: S’that sound tasty to you? Five? [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] So—
Justin: Five feels, like, righter to me?
Clint: And the insects only cover the bottom third of the window, and since I’m short, I just walk riight oon paast…
Travis: Wait, hold on.
Clint: Yeah!
Travis: You don’t get to dictate how it goes.
Clint: I cast it!
Griffin: Alright, I’m gonna roll a Constitution saving throw for all the guards in this room real quick. I’m trying to make this happen. [dice rolls] That’s a four, plus…[exhales] fuck off! There’s no— I had no number prepared for this. Uh, that is— I’m gonna say that’s insufficient. What I think happens is, uh, bugs are covering this window, and while they cover the window, you sprint past. But you hear voices inside go,
Guards: What the fuuuuuck?
And start to come outside. Uh, and as they do, they are swarmed by bugs, and say,
Guards: Oh noooo!
And shut the door, and start talking into their, uh, their radios to the other guards throughout the casino, and pretty soon you hear pounding at the door that Lup just fused shut.
Travis: We out! We out the door! We’re down! Elevator, whatever’s there, [crosstalk] we’re doing it.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Uh, it wor— it worked?
[audience cheers]
Griffin: There’s a certain level of awareness now, uh, but I guess we’ll cross that bridge when we… get to it - right now. As you reach the end of the hallway and turn the corner, uh, Magnus, you bump into someone. A small man in his early 20s with bushy red hair, dressed in the security uniform you’ve seen several other members of the casino staff wearing to this point, and he looks aghast as you run into him—
Travis: I begin to punch him!
Griffin: He leans— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] but I don’t...complete it?
Griffin: He leans back— oh, before you punch him, he says— come on, uh—
Travis: [rising in pitch] I know that’s why I said ‘begin to punch him’ because I knew you were up to something?
Griffin: He says,
Red-Haired Man: [kinda dweeby voice] Hey, wait a minute, you’re not supposed to be back here!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: This isn’t anybody.
[audience laughs]
Red-Haired Man: I don’t think Old Blue Eyes wants you to be back here, right? Wait a minute! [pause] Are the three of you in the middle of a heist? That is so cool!
Travis: Awesome.
Justin: Hey, yeah, good.
Red-Haired Man: My name’s Terry, I, uh, I work here. What’s y’all’s names?
[pause]
Magnus: [unsure] ...Magnus Burnsides.
[audience laughs]
Magnus: I’m rollin’ some bones on ya, Terry!
Terry: Are you the one that made all the bugs come out? I heard about the bugs!
Magnus: No! [crosstalk] No, no no no.
Merle: [crosstalk] That was me! George Cl- Cloovey.
Magnus: I— listen guys, I think Terry’s cool.
Taako: Terry, my name is Angus McDonald. You can write that down… in your notes.
Griffin: And if the police show up later—
Taako: Later, tell ‘em it was me, the… Thievery Kid.
[Griffin & Clint laugh]
{30:31}
Griffin: He says,
Terry: Well my name’s Terry, uh, Angus and Magnus—
Taako: With a P? Silent P at the beginning or no? Just regular—
Magnus: Like pterodactyl!
Griffin: Puh-Terry!
Justin: Puh-Terry.
Magnus: Like the character from Pee-Wee’s Playhouse.
Terry: I see. No, it’s just—
Magnus: Fantasy Pee-Wee’s Playhouse!
Terry: Just big-T Terry!
Magnus: Alright Big-T Terry, you seem cool. Are you cool?
Terry: I’m super cool! I— I work here but it sucks, it’s a shit job! Old Blue Eyes doesn’t pay us very well, my benefits are just straight garbo.
Magnus: Yeah…
Terry: If y’all are doing a heist, lemme get up in this heist! I can help get ya into the vault, and then maybe can split the—
Magnus: Could you— could you pretend to have a different voice if you’re gonna stay with us for an extended period of time?
Griffin: He says,
Terry: Why don’t I help get y’all into the vault and then we can split the loot [crosstalk] five ways.
Magnus: [crosstalk] Yeah but maybe just drop it an octave or two.
Justin: Um—
Terry: [still dweeby, pitched lower] I can help!
Clint: Nah, that’s worse.
Justin: Can I do— can I do, and I don’t know, D&D doesn’t have, like, good things for this, but um, can I do, like, an intelligence check to get a vibe [crosstalk] on Terry?
Travis: [crosstalk] Insight.
Griffin: It’s Insight, it has a literal one for this. Don’t shit on D&D, it has a literal—
Travis: IT’S A ONE.
Justin: That’s a one. I don’t get shit off of that, I dunno.
Griffin: Terry’s— Terry’s— Ter— Well, well a one...Terry is…
Travis: Terry’s Terry!
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s just Terry.
Travis: [crosstalk] He’s an inscrutable—
Justin: [crosstalk] And even that is, like somewhat unclear.
Travis: [crosstalk] He’s an inscrutable cloud, man!
Griffin: He says,
Terry: [original dweeby voice] I can get ya into the, into the, the vault. We’ll just split the loot five ways. What do ya say?
Travis: I rolled a 19 Insight on Terry.
Griffin: Yeah, Terry wants to get you up in that vault.
Travis: Alright.
Merle: You know what? We can definitely [suspiciously] split the loot five waaayyys…
Magnus: You know what, Merle? We don’t have to say it [imitates Merle’s tone] liiike thaaaaat.
Merle: [imitating Magnus] Well we- I- diiiiiid…
Magnus: Ignore him, he’s-
Merle: I diiiiid!
Justin: Thank you.
Magnus: But yes. Yes, Terry, you’re in. You’re our— [crosstalk]
Taako: [crosstalk] Welcome to the squad!
Magnus: Fifth.
Taako: Taako’s Five!
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Griffin: Terry leads, uh, the four of you around, uh, the corner at the end of the hallway, and you see a large, round door leading into the vault. Uh, at the end of that hallway, uh, and flanking that large door, are two panels, one with a loudspeaker and another one with a card slot. Uh, and on the right side of this hallway is a row of, like, twenty lockers, or so? Each one emblazoned with the names of members of, uh, various security personnel. You see “Crush”— [crosstalk], and “Slam”, and “Cram”—
Travis: [crosstalk] We did this, I’m pretty sure, in the mining thing…
Griffin: Oh shit, we did do this in the mining one. This is— different twenty lockers.
[audience laughs at Griffin realizing he goofed his own puzzle]
Griffin: Upon further inspection, the two panels flanking the door seem to be some sort of lock, uh, on the door to the vault access corridor, or just the vault. Them the panel on the left has a button next to the speaker, which you assume to be some sort of voice lock, uh, and the other is a slot for some sort of key card. Uh, and sure enough, because you’re working with Terry, he walks over to the key card slot, takes a key card out of his vest, or whatever?, and slides it through and it turns green-
Travis: Griffin?
Griffin: Yeeeeeeeeesssss?
Travis: Did you invent Terry because we weren’t moving fast enough through this mission?
Justin: [laughing] ‘Hi, my name is Real Terry-’
Travis: ‘I was definitely planned into this!’
Griffin: Part of me assumed you would just kill Terry instantly, which, in my defense, you almost did.
Travis: [rising pitch] I almost did?
Griffin: Uh, Terry walks, after, uh, getting the green light on the card slot, he walks over to the, uh, the speaker panel, and he says,
Terry: Uh, could you all give me a little space, please? Just back up a few feet? This part’s kind of...embarrassing.
Clint: Are we sure we trust Puh-Terry?
Travis: [crosstalk] Sure. I rolled- I got a 19. I trust Terry.
Justin: [crosstalk] He’s good.
Travis: I’m with Terry! Hashtag I’m With Terry.
Terry: I didn’t pick my password, and it’s embarrassing. I don’t want you guys to hear it, can you please gimme some space?
Magnus: No can do, Terry.
Taako: No, it’s fine, give him some space.
Magnus: Okay, okay.
Merle: Yeah, we won’t listen.
Griffin: He walks over to the— you— he walks over to the, uh, the keypad and he kinda [muffled] cups his mouth around it—
Justin: Wait, hold on. Uh, I wanna cast, uh, a spell that puts a eye over there so I can hear him.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Then I would put an ear over there [crosstalk], to hear it.
Travis: [crosstalk] Wait, what?
{34:40}
Justin: [crosstalk] I want— yeah. Put a—
Travis: [crosstalk] You have a ear?
Griffin: He sees you— he sees you start to channel a spell and he says,
Terry: My password is Turkey Boy, ok?
Justin: There we go. Arcane Eye—
Griffin: He goes,
Terry: Greg— Greg saw me eating a turkey sandwich on my first day, and he just wouldn’t shut up about it. It doesn’t even make any sense, it’s not even a good slam!
Taako: God, I hate Greg Grimaldis.
Griffin: Lup is cracking up, she’s like crying laughing, and she’s like,
Lup: Turkey Boy! Oh, man, Greg Grimaldis is a total dick, but that’s good stuff right there.
Griffin: And Terry—
Clint: [crosstalk] Good stuff? Turkey?
Griffin: [reluctantly] ...I guess?
[audience cheers]
Travis: Don’t! Please! You only have to deal with him for this hour and twenty minutes, we have to live with him!
Justin: I’m so glad you all got your tickets for free in a sweepstakes.
Clint: These are my people!
[audience cheers and Clint laughs]
Griffin: Terry unlocks the voice speaker and a bell chimes and the vault door starts sliding open, and he says,
Terry: Now I’ve never actually been in the vault, cause I’m not allowed in the vault, uh, all casino employees are fitted with a security chip that prevents them from entering certain areas. Again, this job fuckin’ sucks. But you should be able to find what you’re looking for in there. Don’t worry, I’ll stand guard here and keep everyone else out.
Magnus: Thanks, Terry. This is for you.
Travis: And I punch him.
Griffin: Oh my god!
Travis: I— I need to knock him out so he doesn’t get in trouble! I don’t want people to know that he was an accomplice!
Clint: So you’re going to physically assault him?
Travis: Yeah!
Justin: I cannot—
Travis: But it was only 13.
Griffin: He dodges out of the way of your blow—
Travis: [crosstalk] So maybe just a black eye? He doesn’t go unconscious.
Griffin: He— you try to punch him, and you definitely do try to punch him—
Travis: I try to punch him again.
Griffin: No, hold on—
Travis: Oh, [?]
Griffin: He says,
Terry: I see what you’re doing.
Griffin: And he punches himself in the face.
Justin: Perfect, perfect.
Travis: [crosstalk] Okay but I did get him on the third time, so he’s got two black eyes.
Terry: Okay, great! This is good! I love all of this!
Clint: I could kill him?
Griffin: Uh, Jesus.
Travis: No!
Justin: You probably couldn’t.
Clint: Loose lips sink ships!
Justin: All right.
Travis: We are already robbing the place!
Griffin: The four of you start to walk into the vault and he says,
Terry: Oh my god, I almost forgot! Um, everything in Greg’s vault is cursed, so that if anyone tries to leave the premises with it, it’ll explode in a pretty terrible fashion.
Magnus: How terrible?
Terry: Pretty bad.
Griffin: He starts rooting around in his bag and he pulls out this, uh, small device, it almost looks like one of those metal detector wands that security personnel at like airports and big events might use? And he hands it to you, uuhh, Merle.
Clint: God!
Justin: God dammit.
Travis: Why did you pick Merle??
Griffin: It’s… the best. And he says,
Terry: If you touch this to anything you want to take out of here, it’ll dispel the curse. It is— Merle,
Griffin: He grabs your face,
Terry: It is super important that you remember to do this, ok? I can’t take— I can’t take twenty percent of some sort of exploded treasure, okay?
Magnus: Whoa, did we say twenty?
Justin: That is a fifth.
Travis: ...but did we say that?
Griffin: As you start to negotiate the details, the, uh, the vault door swings shut behind you as you hear Terry shout,
Terry: Good luck! Don’t forget about that wand! I love you!
[audience laughs]
Justin: Little fast, but all right.
Griffin: And now we are flashed back, uh, to a few nights ago, uh, and she— Lup points to the blueprints again, just past the security hallway, and toward the large vault chamber on the map, and she says—
Travis: [crosstalk] I also— I just want to jump in— picture Barry bringing, like, a tray of hot chocolate, like, “you guys need anything?”
Barry: You guys good in— what are you guys doing in here?
Justin: Don’t worry about it, Barry!
Travis: All right!
Lup: We’re good, babe. Uh, once we make it through the security corridor, we should have access to the vault right here. Not sure why Greg made it so easily accessible, maybe dude just likes having quick access to all this ill-gotten gains, but we’ll breach the room, locate the fifteen-dollar bill, and with any luck, teleport home before we get caught! Now, listen, this is a matter of honour. We are just there for the fifteen dollar bill, nothing else.
Griffin: She says,
Lup: I’m—
[audience laughter]
Justin: I kind of, like— Taako kind of like puts his fists up, like,
Taako: Except…
Griffin: She shakes her— she shakes her head, she says,
Lup: I’m serious. We’re not going to steal anything else while we’re in there.
Griffin: And then we flashback forward to the present, and Lup says,
Lup: I’m going to steal absolutely everything in here.
[audience laughing and cheering]
[Justin laughing]
Taako: Yeeaahh! That’s my sister!
Griffin: The four— the four of you are standing in the casino’s vault, a fifteen foot wide and long room lit brightly overhead by fluorescents. In the middle of this chamber, a tall cauldron sits on the floor nearly overflowing with thousands of shiny gold coins. The walls to the east and west are lined with armaments hanging from decorative plaques, and in the back of the room is a statue of Greg Grimaldis carved out of stone. The statue is [trips over word] intricately— intricately crafted, showing Greg wearing a lavish tuxedo, and his facial features are clearly defined, and his two big wide eyes are looking down at the rest of the vault—
Travis: [crosstalk] So the statue’s gonna come to life, right? We can all agree the statue’s gonna…
Clint: And I’d also like to point out, Griffin, that when I did something similar in the recent arc, I had a picture—
Griffin: [crosstalk] What the f—
Clint: —that I gave everybody of the map and, you know—
Griffin: My words are my pictures!
[audience cheering]
Griffin: Uh, his facial features are clearly defined, save for his two hollow eyes, which look down on the rest of the room with amusement. Sitting at the statue of Greg’s feet is a small chest. What do you do?
Travis: Tell me more about the armaments?
Griffin: Uh, yeah, they just look— they look mostly decorative, but it’s axes and swords, some of them are made of silver, uh, some of them are made of gold…
Travis: Mmmmmm….
Justin: I’ll do— you know what, I’ll do, uh, an Arcana check—
Griffin: [crosstalk] All right.
Justin: —to see if I sense any magical higgledy piggledy. That’s a natural 20. What’s the scoop on magic.
Griffin: Yeah!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Uh, with a 20—
Travis: Those dice, by the way, from ThinkGeek, and apparently, they’re weighted.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: [simultaneously] Yeah. Go fig.
Griffin: Uh… Everything is magical, and—
Justin: Schools of magic are probably what I would define with a 20 [crosstalk], I think I’d be getting, like, some transmutation, evocation…
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, okay okay okay...
{40:50}
Griffin: Uh, trap magic is [crosstalk] good—
Justin: Trap magic, yeah. I love that fuckin’ sound, dude. [crosstalk] When I get down to Ibiza, all I want is fuckin’ trap magic, baby.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of nice snares… Yeah, sure.
[Travis cackling]
Justin: Fuckin’ blaze it, dude. Can’t get loud enough!
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: All right. I have—
Griffin: Start touching things!
Clint: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Travis: [crosstalk] No, wait! Hold on. He said trap magic. I assume you say it?
Taako: Guys, it’s trap magic.
Travis: Thank you. I want you to picture, like, a Pooh and a lotta, like, [high pitched sliding sound] whooop!
Griffin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Clint: So, is this the curse he mentioned...?
Griffin: You have no way of knowing what any of that is, but [crosstalk] maybe?
Travis: [crosstalk] Well you’re here, we could just ask you.
Clint: I have— I like— I’m, like, a magic guy.
Griffin: [crosstalk] This is true.
Travis: [crosstalk] Are you?
Justin: All evidence to the contrary… um, I’m going to… at the chest—
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: I want to do, um, an Investigation on the chest.
Travis: Do you know what’s amazing?
Griffin: What? [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] What’s amazing—
Griffin: How slow we’re moving right now? How the momentum of the show—
Justin: It’s a— it’s a 18. Plus… 8.
Griffin: Uh, the chest is trapped, not magically, but with a wire on the inside. It’s a more physical—
Taako: Hey, this chest is trapped. Could you use your rogue—
Magnus: [high pitched] Yeeah!
Taako: —perversions to—
Travis: I have thief’s tools proficiency, times 2.
Griffin: Yeah, so you’ll just roll, uh, a d20 and you’ll add your proficiency bonus twice to it.
Travis: 13 plus 8. 21.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s good. You get in there and you sort of slip your tools around the wire and you sort of unspool it really expertly.
Travis: I’m doing it!
Griffin: Yeah, ok. And the chest— and the chest pops open, and no trap is sprung. What the— what— you’re doing the—
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m doing the [double] six? [something] double six. <<42:50>>
Griffin: You’re doing the Goofy Movie ultimate cast.
[audience cheers]
Travis: [sings] If we listen to each other’s hearts, find we’re never too far apart, and maybe that is the reason why for the first time ever we’re seeing it eye to eye! God, I love that movie!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Within—
Travis: [singing] For the first time—
Griffin: Within the chest— please stop— within the chest, you see a red cushion housing a circle of gemstones. Arranged in that pattern are a pair of the following: emeralds—
Justin: I dropped one of my die.
Griffin: —emeralds, opaz— opaz? [crosstalk] Opaz is nothing.
Justin: [crosstalk] Opazes?
Travis: Opaz! A cross between opal and topaz!
Taako: Guys this one’s really rare, I’ve never even heard of this one, we gotta steal it first!
Griffin: Emeralds, o— emeralds, opals, topazes, sapphires, diamonds, and rubies.
Justin: Dapphires. Tubies.
Travis: [laughing] Tubies! Oh my god, there’s beautiful tubies in here!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Do you see how the clock says three minutes on it? And you’re—
Justin: I actually don’t have visibility on the clock.
Griffin: Okay, it’s—
Justin: What is it now?
Griffin: Holy shit. Emeralds, opals, topazes, sapphires, diamonds, and rubies.
Justin: It’s the order—
Travis: [crosstalk] Okay there’s a puzzle here, we have to get the—
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, what’s the order— is the order of those important? Is it alphabe— okay, let’s talk about the—
Griffin: There is an order.
Travis: Diamonds, rubies—
Griffin: Okay, yes, go.
Travis: Dr. Pepper. Diamonds, rubies. Topaz.
Clint: [crosstalk] Okay, what about the chemical composition of diamonds and rubies?
Travis: [crosstalk] Emerald.
Justin: [crosstalk] Diamonds, rubies, topaz. D, R—
Travis: [crosstalk] Donut.
Justin: [crosstalk] D, R—
Clint: [crosstalk] What if it’s Ruby Tuesday— Ruby Tuesdays...
Travis: [crosstalk] My— my rambunctious mother—
Griffin: I don’t— I think you missed this part too, there’s two of each of them.
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay.
Travis: [crosstalk] Okay. Diamond, diamond, topaz, topaz, opal, opaz, topaz, diamond, diamond, tymond, [starts speaking gibberish].
Justin: So that’s diamond, topaz, emerald, ruby, [crosstalk] hearts, stars, horseshoes, clovers and balloons…
Clint: [crosstalk] Diamond, topaz, emerald, ruby...
Travis: Just give me the stones one more time, Griff. [crosstalk] Give me the stones!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Emeralds. Emeralds—
Clint: Wait! E…
Griffin: [exasperated] Oh, it’s not the letters!
Clint: Wait a minute! It’s colours!
Griffin: Opals, topaz—
Clint: [crosstalk] Green, orange, purple—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Sapphires, diamonds, and rubies.
Clint: Striped.
Justin: Diamonds don’t really fit into, like, a—
Clint: Plaid.
Justin: Diamonds don’t fit into, like, a rainbow kind of thing. A prismatic situation.
Travis: It’s the Mohs Hardness Scale!
Griffin: [talking loudly over Travis] Because you take so long in the rooooom—
Travis: It’s the Mohs Hardness Scale!
Griffin: Just, an alarm sounds, because you’ve been in here for so long without solving the trap, and—
Justin: I grab all of the stones and put them in my bag.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I disarmed the trap!
Griffin: Uh, it doesn’t matter, this is a time alarm, because the three of you aaaaare dipshiiiiits!
Taako: Quick! Merle, Merle, use the wand on my bag, quick!
Clint: Quick! I use the wand in his bag and immediately—
Justin: Wooop! Moving on.
Griffin: Uh, the alarm does shut off, but you assume that to actually be Terry’s doing?
Justin: Nice.
Magnus: Sick, Terry!
Griffin: —but the, uh— The magical trap has been sprung and gold has begun pouring out of the cauldron in the center of the room, clattering to the ground below, almost as if it’s multiplying rapidly, threatening to flood the room that you’re standing in. It’s up to your ankles. Uh, what do you do? Also the chest, uh— I’ll give you this because we gotta move on, uh, the chest has an arrow pointing upwards to the statue of Greg Grimaldis.
Travis: Does Greg have these gems somewhere on him?
Griffin: He does not. Greg Grimaldis, a statue carved of stone, the statue is intricately crafted showing Greg wearing a lavish tuxedo and his facial features are clearly defined, save for his two hollow eyes, which look down at the rest of the vault—
Justin: [crosstalk] Ooohkay.
Clint: [crosstalk] Blue! Sapphires! Put sapphires in his eyes!
Travis: [crosstalk] Put the sapphires in his eyes!
Justin: [crosstalk] Put the— we put the sapphires in there!
Clint: [crosstalk] Put sapphires in his eyes! Yeah!
Travis: [crosstalk] Sapphires in his eyes, alright.
[audience cheers]
Clint: That’s mine! That’s mine! Yeah, I got it first.
Justin: Yeah, Clint solved it everybody.
Clint: [crosstalk] Sapphires in his eyes.
Griffin: Gold reaches up to your knees as you place the sapphires into the statue’s eyes, and it raises up out of the floor, displacing a pile of gold as it lifts up. And underneath it you see what looks like an elevator car attached to the bottom of a statue.
[various whoops from audience members]
Griffin: The doors— yeah, elevators, fuck yeah— the doors of the car—
[audience cheers]
Travis: I use the pocket workshop to get a bunch of gold in there.
Griffin: Uh, okay, you scoop some gold into the pocket workshop—
Travis: Like a lot. I put it over the, the cauldron as it just...
{46:55}
Griffin: Uh, the doors of the car open up, allowing a few hundred gold coins to spill inside, allowing you access to the car. Uh, and as it—
Travis: How much gold do you think is in the pocket workshop?
Griffin: Three thousand gold pieces.
Travis: That’s a lot of gold!
Griffin: Lup—
Justin: That’s nice.
Griffin: Lup says,
Lup: I’m guessing this is some sort of decoy vault. Grimaldis, you slippery shit! Well, we’re already in it, you know, I say we keep pushing on!
Griffin: And she walks over to the elevator car.
Taako: Yeah, let’s do it, are you kidding me?
Travis: Yeah! We’ve only got— oh, negative 46 seconds!
Griffin: Uh-oh! The four of you step into the elevator car and the glass door back into the vault closes in front of you. And just as you see the gold, uh, just as you see the door back into the hallway, you hear people starting to pound at it. The -elevator moves. Uh, also, inside the gold that’s on the floor, you see a golden shark fin pop up and start to swim towards you. That was just a cool part of this trap that I thought was gonna get sprung earlier, but I didn’t get to use it. But right as the shark is about to reach you, this cool gold shark— it was gonna, like, pull you in under the gold, and it was gonna be a fun thing, but [crosstalk] it didn’t happen.
Travis: [crosstalk] So so far in McElroy canon, glass shark, gold shark.
Griffin: Yeah, we’re doing all the sharks. [audience cheers] This elevator cart doesn’t move down, the floor simply disappears beneath your feet, and you’re all falling with a shower of golden coins close behind— don’t. I know I said…
[audience laughs]
Clint: So it’s golden...
Griffin: Nooope ba ba bap!
Travis: What??
Clint: And it’s a shower…
Travis: [crosstalk] Look at the timer! This is not something my Dad should know about!
Justin: [crosstalk] Griffin got there first!
Griffin: [crosstalk] What— what you fear to be a deadly trap quickly reveals itself to be something more innocuous. You’re on a long, golden slide, spiraling downwards through rings of silvery light, it’s actually pretty fun. And your trip ends as you—
Travis: Is there, like, Sonic music playing?
Griffin: Yes. [sings a tune] Dat da da da da, and you’re sliding through the, the last ring of light, and now the four of you are falling into this enormous room, five times the size of the decoy vault you were just in. And after falling 20 feet or so off the end of the slide, your landing is cushioned by a huge pile of paper. But not just any paper— beneath you, and piled up against the walls of this room in these tall slopes, are mountains of fifteen dollar bills.
Justin: Oh, fuck.
Griffin: These piles lead downward to the center of the room, where the bills have been swept away into a circular clearing, and in the center of that clearing is a large, ten foot tall slot machine. It looks much older than the others you saw in the gaming pit. It’s made of ornate wood and heavy iron plating. And Lup, when you crash down into the money, she says,
Lup: We’re close, but I don’t think any of these are the original. We have to find the first fifteen dollar bill if we want to shut down this whole operation.
Griffin: And she slides— she sleds down the, uh the cash pile towards the slot machine [crosstalk] in the center of the room.
Clint: [crosstalk] Ooh, paper cuts! [sucks breath in]
Griffin: I’m just gonna go turbo speed now— as the four of you approach the giant ancient slot machine, Lup turns towards the rest of you, and she says,
Lup: Anyone else want to handle this? I’m not feeling particularly lucky today.
Taako: Yeah, I don’t know who the—
Merle: I’ll do it!
Taako: All right.
Magnus: [crosstalk] I don’t think we’re, uh—
Griffin: [crosstalk] All right, Merle.
Clint: Yeah, Merle does it!
Griffin: Merle, you walk up and pull the lever of the slot machine [Clint: Yeah!] and the three wheels inside start spinning, showing colourful flashes of cherries, sevens, gold coins, and fifteen-dollar bills, and it starts chiming out this high— high pitched sound, like this tinkling noise, and then the wheels come to a sudden stop, and three symbols align on the display: skulls.
And a window slides open above the slots, and a light flickers on inside that window, and you see a face with jet black hair and sideburns, and a wide grin punctuated with one gold tooth and two bright blue eyes. And seeing this face inside the slot machine, Lup gasps and you hear the voice of Greg Grimaldis boom throughout the vault— what did he fuckin’ sound— he sound—
Justin: He’s like a heavy New York— [crosstalk] Yeah, kind of—
Travis: [imitating Greg’s voice] [crosstalk] Heeyy, I see—
Clint: [imitating Greg’s voice] [crosstalk] Heeyy!
Greg Grimaldis: [crosstalk] You didn’t think it was gonna be that easy, didja?
Merle: Yeah?
Griffin: And the slot machine starts lifting up slowly from the ground as two thick wooden legs sprout from its base, and two long arms and a mechanical head sprout from its top. And while this slot machine transforms into this imposing figure, Greg speaks and says,
Greg Grimaldis: You didn’t think I knew you’d be back someday, Lup? You didn’t think I’d know the second you crossed the threshold of this casino? You and your brother, you’ve always been too proud, and you know what they say about pride. Like… what it comes before.
Griffin: And Lup—
Merle: In the dictionary?
Griffin: And Lup— [chuckles] and Lup smirks and her hands catch fire, and she says,
Lup: You know what? I take it back.
Griffin: And she turns towards Greg and she says,
Lup: I am feeling lucky.
{51:31}
[audience cheers]
Griffin: We’re gonna take an intermission now so we can all go use the bathroooom, and we’ll be back!
Travis: There are posters out the in the lobby!
Griffin: There’s posters out in the lobby, and also bathrooms everywhere, not everywhere, they’re where the bathrooms are.
Justin: Don’t— don’t use the bathroom everywhere. Bye.
Griffin: We’ll be right back.
[THEME MUSIC: ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson]
{51:55-57:14, Commercial Break}
Justin: —weave this tapestry...
Griffin: Let’s roooooollllllllll initiative!
Justin: There we go. [audience cheers, dice hits table] That’s a nine for Hoops.
Travis: That issss…. seventeen.
[dice hits table, Clint laughs maniacally]
Justin: Well that’s not— that’s not actually that helpful because that just means you have to take the initiative first. You didn’t actually do—
Clint: I rolled a twenty! Give me a little freakin’ credit!
Justin: Okay. Okay.
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Uh, Merle goes first. Merle, you are standing in front of this, uh, ten-foot-tall slot machine, sort of, mech, with Greg Grimaldis inside of it. What do you do?
Clint: I cast Guardian of Faith!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Oldie but a goodie. What’s that one do?
Clint: That creates a giant Della Reese!
Griffin: Sure.
Clint: And Giant Della Reese— any creature that’s hostile, is hostile to you, that moves to a space within 10 feet of us for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.
Griffin: Gotcha.
Clint: So she just stands there.
Griffin: [laughing] She just stands there.
Clint: Yeah. Just stands there lookin’, and she’s got this look on her face. [makes a face at the audience]
Griffin: Okaayyyy.
Justin: It’s an audio podcast.
Griffin: Uh, Greg Grimaldis is up next. Uh, and, I guess he’s gonna roll a Dexterity saving throw. [dice hits table] Uh, that is an 11, which is not gonna beat your spellcasting modifier. [Clint: Nope!] So roll that beautiful Bean footage.
Clint: The creature takes twenty radiant damage!
Griffin: Oh! Okay.
Clint: On a failed save!
Griffin: That’s what that was, so, good!
[Justin & audience laugh]
Griffin: The slot machine robot rears up one of its arms and pulls the lever, and, uh, the slots start spinning… and it lands on three fifteen-dollar bills. Uh, and, when that happens, this big pile that’s just all around the room, pressed up against the walls of this room, you see a shape start to take form inside of this cache. And this big face with two hands emerges, this twenty-foot-tall face of money with these two big money hands, uh, takes shape. And the money monster— another classic— it’s just George Clooney fest up in here!— uh, will act next, and is going to slam one of those big fists down on Taakooo.
Justin: Come on…
Griffin: Taakoooo… that is a nineteen versus AC.
Justin: [crosstalk] Mmmthat’s gonna do it.
Travis: [crosstalk] Um, as a protection fighter, disadvantage, re-roll that shiiit!
Griffin: Okay.
{59:44}
[audience cheers]
Griffin: That is a fifteen versus AC.
Justin: That’s still gonna do it.
Griffin: Okayyy…
Justin: [crosstalk] I’m dressed in rags, my skin is-
Travis: [crosstalk] Remind me to get you a better hat!
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Uh, that is 21 points of money damaaaaage… [Justin: Ooh…] As it slams a big money-fist down on you… That is-
Justin: It’s, uh…
[audience member: “Cash money!”]
Griffin: That is— it is money. Next in the order is Magnus.
Travis: Um… So. First, tell me more about these wooden legs. Are they tree-like?
[audience cheers]
Griffin: ...they were formerly trees, yes.
Travis: Yeahhhhhh! Okay, that is a… twenty-four.
Griffin: [resigned] Shit.
[pause]
Travis: I rolled a fourteen, I get plus TEN!
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I only do one thing! Um, and then that is… uh, nine plus five, fourteen points of damage, and I cleave a leg in half.
Griffin: Yeah, I think one of the legs is just gone, and, uh-
Travis: Okay!
Justin: Nice!
Travis: And then with my second attack…
Griffin: I can bet, I can guess...
Travis: I’m gonna attack the money monster with my Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Griffin: Oh shit.
[audience cheers]
Clint: And?
Justin: Okay, one— one small, uh, note… [dramatic pause] MY Flaming [crosstalk] Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah. I’m going to attack—
Justin: [crosstalk] That I do let you use.
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m going to attack the money monster with Taako’s—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Flaming—
Justin: From the Taako Library. It’s got the stamp on it, it says ‘Please Return to, if you die again’—
Clint: ‘Stolen From’—
[dice roll]
Griffin: It did not go through the dice tower, it does not count!
[dice rolls again]
Travis: Okay great, because that was aaaaaaa… twenty-nine—
Griffin: Yes!
Travis: Um, so that’s [mumbled] one d8… [dice rolls] that was 2, plus 24, so 26 points of damage! And I assume, because it’s money, and it’s fire—
Griffin: Yeah it’s actually 52 points of damage, um—
Travis: Ayyyy...
Justin: Yeahhh…
[audience cheers]
Griffin: As you swipe— [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] A very good sword, Connor, a very good sword.
Griffin: Connor? Not— Colin!
Travis: Aww, Colin!
Clint: Colin is here tonight! The kid that created—
Justin: Colin, are you here?
Griffin: Thank you, Colin, you crushed it with this very good sword.
Justin: Colin—
Clint: If you see a kid dressed like Angus going [crosstalk] ‘yeah, I made that’—
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, that’s not gonna narrow it down. Colin? Where are you, Colin? Colin? We’re pointing up, can we get some house lights for a second?
Clint: House lights?
Justin: House lights pleeeaaassseeee??
Griffin: Are we putting Colin on blast right now?
Travis: Where i—
[Colin’s father holds him up]
{62:14}
Justin: There he is! No, don’t drop him! There he is! Hey everybody look!
Clint: Don’t hold him up over the balcony!
Justin: Oh, god!
Griffin: Jesus!
Justin: The end. Jesus.
Clint: You went all Michael Jackson on him there, dangling him over the edge!
Travis: Put— put Blanket down…
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: Alright.
Griffin: Alright, fifty-two points of damage, thank you Colin— [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Thank you, Colin, thank you.
Griffin: Colin, these are your 52 points of damage, that—
Justin: That you gave to me, and I loaned to him.
Griffin: Uh, and you see this big, flaming streak go up the money monster’s chest, and it roars as it takes this huge hit, and then the fire starts to spread throughout the money surrounding the room.
Justin: Uh ohhhhh…
[audience laughs]
Travis: That’s Taako’s fire!
[Clint & audience laugh]
{63:12}
Griffin: Next in the order is Taako! Taako, you have a one-legged, slightly damaged, uh, slot machine in front of you and a, uh, uh, money monster who is on fire and sort of flailing around, and also the room’s catching on fire. Pretty good heist.
Justin: Where am I? [nervous laugh] Where am I in relation to the money monster?
Griffin: Uh, you’re— the, the slot machine monster’s, like, between you and them. You’re about 30 feet away from them, I’d say.
Justin: Okayyy… well, I’ll run around him…
Griffin: ‘Kay.
Justin: And over to the money monster.
Griffin: I’m gonna do an attack of opportunity on you. [pause] It’s fine, it’s just some damage.
[Justin laughs]
Griffin: Uh, that’s a seventeen versus AC?
Justin: Yeah, how much damage would you like to give me?
[dice rolls]
Griffin: Seventeen points of damage!
Justin: That’s a very good amount of damage, thank you.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Don’t worry, canonically, I can’t die.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Actually, we’re after the events of the recorded Adventure Zone, so—
Travis: [high pitched] But he was at Magnus’s bedside [crosstalk] when Magnus died.
Griffin: Oh, shit. [crosstalk] Spoilers, shut up!
[audience cheers]
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Jesus!
Travis: [crosstalk] Magnus is mortal—
Clint: [crosstalk] You do have a rather accomplished healer in your party…
Justin: Of course.
Travis: [blows raspberry] Who, Lup?
Justin: Well, ok, now— now I’m nervous. Um, alright, but I’m gonna get over there and I am gonna cast Wall of Ice to create a hemispheric dome, um, with a radius of 10 feet, um, made of ice, um, around— near myself, the money monster, and the fire to try to put that situation out.
Griffin: Are you trying to capture yourself in this ice… sphere?
Justin: Noooo…
Griffin: Nooo, I didnt think... Okay.
Justin: No, Griffin, that would be… ill-advised, I think. [Griffin: Okay.] Uh, I think what I’m going to do as a sentient being that wants to preserve its own life— [Griffin laughs] And wants to preserve canon, frankly, will cast that in a 10-foot sphere centered on the money monster.
Griffin: Okay!
Justin: Uh, so, this…
Griffin: Do you just do it?
{65:03}
Justin: ‘Scuse me? Gonna make a Dexterity saving throw, and on a failed save you will take some amount of damage.
Griffin: Okay.
[dice rolls]
Griffin: I’m… very sorry [laughs], uh, I did roll a nineteen, plus four, a twenty-three.
Justin: Okay, that’s higher than my modifier.
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: So…
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’ll take some damage though!
Travis: [crosstalk] We’ll edit this point out, roll again.
Griffin: No, it’ll take some damage!
Justin: No wait, yeah, you’re gonna take… 5d6 damage.
Griffin: [whispered] Oh fuck.
Justin: Six… ten… eleven… fourteen… seventeen.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Some?
Griffin: Yeah, that’s very good. Uh, the money monster looks very bad. You create this Wall of Ice, but it leaps over it, and, and takes some damage from, like, the jagged icicle shards on top of it, uh, that, that scrape into it. Uh, and it lands in front of you, separated now from the big money pile, so it is sort of… separated from its… life force, I guess? Uh, but the, uh, the fire is still starting to spread around the money in the room, uh, creating a— some, some smoke that is now pouring up to the ceiling.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Uh, next up is Lup, who says—
[audience cheers]
Griffin: She— she says—
Travis: Oh, does… does everyone like Lup?
[Griffin laughs, audience cheers]
Clint: More than us?
[audience member: “Yeah…”]
Griffin: Yeah.
[Travis laughs, audience cheers]
Griffin: She says—
Clint: Security!
Griffin: She says
Lup: Well, uh, if it’s already on fire...
Griffin: And she casts Flame Blade. Uh, you evoke a fiery blade in your free hand, the blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar and lasts for the duration, uh—
Travis: I want you to picture Magnus going
Magnus: Ey! Ey! You! Ah! [sounds of protestation]
Lup: Same hat! Same hat!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Uh, she stabs the Flame Blade into the money monster and pulls it up, uh, and hits it forrrr… uh, eighteen, which is thirty-six points of fire damage. The—
{67:00}
Clint: [mocking] Ooooh!
Griffin: And the money monster is cut in half, and half of it just burns away in the smoke and now it’s just half— it’s, uh, kind of a—
Travis: Now it’s seven fifty.
Griffin: It’s a much smaller— it’s a much smaller money monster.
Clint: Now it’s made of euros.
Travis: Euros are actually doing better than the dollar.
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh really, is it?
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, I don’t know.
Griffin: Next in the order is— next in the order is Merle Highchurch. This has been our… finance shooooowww? ‘What is Money?’
Clint: Mass Healing Word.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I’m gonna— wait a minute—
Griffin: Has anybody [crosstalk] taken damage?
Travis: [crosstalk] Only Taako’s been hurt!
Clint: Well then I think it’s appropriate that I would waste this spell on just that. [audience laughs] Maybe I shouldn’t.
Griffin: No, go for it! Do what you want!
Clint: I’ll cast Mass Healing Word.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: As I call out words of restoration - ‘Go, team, go!’ - um—
Justin: Very good.
Clint: Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4—
Griffin: The money monster looks at you pleadingly, like [makes puppy eyes, audience laughs]
Clint: Awww… [crosstalk] Aww, wow…
Griffin: [crosstalk] It can’t talk, but it’s like [mimics threatening to cry]
Clint: Aww…
Justin: Don’t.
Clint: No. No. I guess I d— do I have to specify? I guess I—
Griffin: ‘Just the good guys! The good— the good part of the team! The— the—’ your friends.
Clint: Yeah, just the good pe— part of my team.
[rolls dice]
Griffin: That’s the tiniest dice.
Clint: How do you— oh, two, plus my spell modifier.
Griffin: Which is eight. [audience member: “Ten!”] Thank you, ten.
Clint: Hey!
Griffin: Everybody is healed for ten points of damage.
Travis: Ok, Magnus feels exactly the same.
Justin: I appreciate that, [crosstalk] thank you.
Clint: [crosstalk] And I don’t guess a ‘thank you’, would kill ya, would it?
Taako: Tha— thanks! Thanks for the fuckin’ Ludens.
[Griffin laughs]
Taako: Ten whole points, you shouldn’t have! My migraine disappeared!
[Clint laughs]
Griffin: Uh, up next is Greg Grimaldis, and the wheels spiiiiin, and he gets… all sevens, uh, across the dial.
Taako: Hooray!
Griffin: And, Magnus, uh, the, the slot-machine-bot points a fist at you, and a rocket punch comes flying [crosstalk] at you—
Travis: I point a fist back and punch back!
[audience cheers, dice rolls]
Griffin: Uh… that is a 26 versus AC.
Travis: That’s a Nat 1.
Griffin: You can’t fuckin’ punch during my punch!
{69:39}
Travis: It was a Nat 1.
Clint: It was a Nat 1.
Griffin: Okay. Uh, 26 v AC?
Travis: [sad noises] Yeah...
Griffin: It’s a fuckin’ hit, uh—
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: With its, uh, seventh attack, it punches you for seventy-seven points of damage.
[audience recoils]
Travis: I am going to use— hold on— I am gonna use parry—
Griffin: Okay. [gruff voice] ‘Hey, it’s Perry, what did you need?’
Clint: [gruff voice] ‘Oh shit! Ow!’
Justin: [gruff voice] ‘Heard you’re gettin’ the shit kicked outta ya, what’s up?’
Griffin: [gruff voice] ‘This room’s super fuckin’ on fire, I gotta get outta here!’
Justin: [gruff voice] ‘Hey listen,—’
Travis: I’m gonna reduce it by eight. [chuckles]
Griffin: Okay. [audience laughs] [realizing the math] Oh! NICE!
[audience erupts]
Justin: [muffled] It’s the sex number.
[long pause]
Clint: [muffled] Ohhhhhhh!
[audience cheers]
Clint: It was a different number when I was in college.
{70:41}
Justin: Grooooooooossssssssssssssss!
Travis: Ahh!
Clint: Yeah!
Travis: I am—
Griffin: Next!
Travis: I am—
Clint: By the way— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] —barely bloodied, by the way—
Clint: Colin, I apologize for saying ‘fuck’ earlier.
Griffin: Yeah, shit— yeah, a lot of bad stuff.
Justin: Again. You did just say it again.
Clint: That was wrong, do not—
Griffin: Okay—
Clint: I’m not a role model—
Griffin: Stop. Obviously.
Clint: Obviously!
Griffin: Uh, next in the order is Magnus. You just got rocket-punched for so much damage.
[audience members: “Say the number!”]
Travis: Uh-huh.
[audience members: “Say it! How much damage?”]
Griffin: Uh— sixty-nine points of damage.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: We did it! We did the joke already! We did it! Uh—
Travis: I’m going to attack, like, I dunno— this isn’t— this isn’t Price is Right! Don’t need your help! I’m gonna attack it with weapons!
Clint: Waitwaitwait! No! Bid on it!
Travis: Um, y’know what?
Griffin: What? [pause] Chicken butt.
[audience laughs]
Travis: I’m, uh, gonna Railsplit the other leg.
Griffin: Okay!
[dice rolls]
Justin: [muffled] So slow...
Travis: Uh, it’s a six, plus ten…
Griffin: Six— sixteen?
Travis: Yeah!
Griffin: We appreciate—
Justin: Listen, I am so glad that many of you were over-served at dinner, if we could all pump the interactions this way, that would be great, thank you.
Griffin: Sixteen, uh, yeah, sixteen hits this, uh, this—
Travis: It does?
Griffin: This one leg. Sure, fuck it, why not?
Travis: Okay, cool!
{71:53}
Clint: It’s a leg!
Griffin: It’s just a leg.
[dice rolls]
Travis: Uh, seven… plus 5, twelve?
Griffin: Alright.
Travis: And I cleave it in twain.
Griffin: Yep! That leg’s gone too! Now the— pff— robot’s just sorta sittin’ on the ground, relaxiiiinnnggg.
Travis: And I’m gonna attack money monster with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom!
Griffin: Okay.
[dice rolls]
Travis: Mmm ‘s a two.
[pause]
Clint: What has happened to you?
Griffin: Uh, that’s a m—
Travis: I’ve become observed.
Griffin: That’s a miss?
[Clint laughs]
Travis: Oh, I mean!
Clint: The truth will out in Nashville! [for those who forgot, Travis… edits rolls]
Griffin: Uh, that’s a miss, uh—
Travis: And then I am going to use, uh, my Action Surge—
Griffin: Yeah, sure, I thought there was—
[dice rolls]
Travis: There we go. That’s a fourteen, plus ten is twenty-four.
Griffin: Yes. On the money monster?
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: It had one hit point left. It just ex— it— it was one, single dollar bill just like [singing] ‘I’m just a bill, yes— oh, fuck!’
[audience cheers]
Griffin: The money monster is vanquished, but the fire, uh, on the outside walls of the room, is like— it’s taken up, like, half the room, and [crosstalk] it’s getting hot in here.
Travis: [crosstalk] And with my extra attack, my Action Surge, I get an extra attack?
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: Okay.
[audience members yell suggestions]
Clint: Don’t help him!
Travis: I’m going to throw my Chance Lance to wedge one of the wheels in place.
Griffin: There’s no wheels. Oh! Ok, ok, there are wheels.
Travis: Fifteen plus ten, twenty-five.
Griffin: Uh, yeah, sure. Uh, roll— roll damage on that.
[dice rolls]
Travis: That’s an eight! Plus, uh… plus five, thirteen.
Griffin: Uh, yeah. Thirteen points of damage. Okay! Uhhhh… cool. The, uh, I think, like, a spring, just, like, pops out of this old slot machine monster, kind of like if it was an old-timey cartoon—
Travis: My colon!
Griffin: You— [laughs] Uh, alright. Uh—
Justin: I didn’t think it would make it back to me, I thought you would all have this… sorted out. I think, I’ll, uh… [audience member: “Fireball!”] Uh, Fireball.
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Justin: I did have that pulled up.
Travis: But also, don’t help, but… thank you.
Justin: That was what I was gonna do, I mean, it’s a big wood thing, it’s almost dead, I’ll just go ahead and throw a fireball at it. Dexterity saving throw.
[dice rolls]
Griffin: No!
Travis: No.
Justin: No. It’s 8d6… nineteen.
Griffin: Nineteen points of damage.
Justin: Nineteen points of damage.
Griffin: Uh, can I paint— Can I paint a picture? With my words?
Justin: Yeah, [crosstalk] please do.
Clint: [crosstalk] You always do.
Griffin: As you start to channel this Fireball, you feel Lup up against your back, and you feel her actually conjuring a Fireball at the same time, as the two of you, fuckin’, Jessie-and-James-from-Pokémon-style… throw two Fireballs at the slot machine monster that spiral around each other and slam into it at the same time— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] It’s like, one’s blue and one’s red, and it’s like—
Griffin: [crosstalk] —yeah yeah yeah, hitting it for thirty-eight points of damage.
Justin: Nice!
[audience cheers]
{74:51}
Griffin: It is… still up, but it looks really bad off, and also it’s a little bit on fire, so you hear Greg Grimaldis inside, going like
Greg: OH! Aww, beans!
Griffin: Also, this room is now completely on fire. The walls of this room are just surrounded by flame, and it’s actually— all of you make a Constitution saving throw, [crosstalk] as you are choking down smoke.
Justin: [crosstalk] Not my strong suit…
Clint: Is that dangerous?
Justin: Seventeen…
Griffin: Hey, everybody, this is a PSA! Fire smoke, super-duper dangerous, and—
Justin: Nineteen for me.
Griffin: Okay, you’re okay.
Travis: Twenty-two!
Griffin: You’re okay.
Clint: Nineteen!
Griffin: Okay, everybody’s fine!
[audience cheers]
Griffin: Back up to the top of the order, [crosstalk] as he breathes—
Travis: [crosstalk] [heavy inhale sounds] It’s delicious!
{75:38}
Griffin: You do vape tricks with the smoke.
[audience laughs]
Travis: COTTON!
Griffin: Yes. Yes, cotton. Cotton indeed.
Travis: [laughing] Cotton, indeed!
Griffin: Uh, next in the order is Merle Highchurch.
Clint: Go with this.
Justin: Oh, God.
Griffin: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
Clint: Go with this. I ask Greg,
Merle: Which one is the real fifteen-dollar bill?
Clint: And I cast ZONE OF TRUTH! [audience applauds] So it doesn’t burn up!
Travis: Y’all. No joke. This is the most proud I’ve ever been of my dad.
Griffin: Yeah, very good.
Travis: Not because he used it well! But because he found a justifiable way to use it at all.
[audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh—
Clint: [pretending to cry] Thank you very much!
Travis: I love you, Daddy.
Griffin: I rolled— I rolled a seven, and— Greg Grimaldis says,
Greg: Yeah, I got it in here. It’s in here, with me, in this locket around my neck.
Merle: Well, Greg, if you want us to save ya, you gotta give it to us!
Justin: Okay, I like that.
Griffin: He says—
Clint: I mean, I’m sorry,
Merle: Greg, if you want us to save ya—
Justin: Thank you.
Merle: Ya gotta give it to us!
Travis: And remember, Griffin, you are in his Zone of Truth.
Griffin: He says,
Greg: No, I think I’m just gonna punch you right now.
Griffin: And then he punches you right now. He’s telling the truth!
Clint: I thought— I thought we burned his arms off!
Griffin: You burned his legs— you cut his legs off…
Clint: How’s he gonna reach me?
Travis: He’s got big arms.
Clint: I dodge.
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: I weave.
Justin: I step back.
Griffin: Uh… that is only a nine versus AC.
Clint: Noooooo, I’m sorry, that doesn’t hurt me at all.
Griffin: Okay, he tries to punch you and fails very badly. He says
Greg: I feel em— I feel embarrassed in front of all of you.
[audience laughs]
Greg: I don’t like how on-fire my casino is right now. [pause] I liked the ending of Lost, I don’t—
[McEl-boys & audience laugh]
Travis: I attack Greg.
Griffin: Okay! It is your turn.
Travis: With the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Griffin: Okay!
Justin: You’re gonna kill him then, okay.
Travis: That is—
Clint: Aww!
Travis: Eighteen plus ten.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: That is… thirty-six. [all laugh] Um— that was a joke. Cuz it was bad math. Um, let’s see… [dice roll] But no one laughed so it’s not a joke.
Clint: Colin—
Griffin: Stop referencing—
Clint: Colin, bad math is not a joke.
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s not how a joke works.
Justin: [crosstalk] There’s— there’s nothing funny about bad math, Colin.
Travis: That is a nine, plus twenty-four, thirty-three points of damage.
Griffin: It explodes. Uh, the slot machine robot, you just stab into it and ten more springs shoot out of it and you see Greg’s face illuminated from underneath like
Greg: [fear noises]
Griffin: And it explodes, which sends Greg tumbling down hard to the floor, his cape still sort of on fire.
Travis: You know what’s interesting? It just occurred to me. I’ve used the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom many times, never dealt with Poison damage.
Griffin: Yeah…
Travis: Huh.
Griffin: Huh.
Travis: It’s not funny, really, so much as it’s just… bad gameplay.
{78:44}
Griffin: Yeah, sure. Uh, Greg tumbles down hard to the floor several feet away from your party as this room is just in a big blaze. Uh, and as he falls, a large locket slips off his neck and skids to a halt at your feet. And, surveying the scene around him, Greg says
Greg: Okay, fine, the fifteen-dollar bill is in that locket, just please don’t kill me! I’ll be good from now on, I promise!
[audience member: “Finish him!”]
Griffin: Holy shit!
Travis: Greg has a fake family!
Griffin: Uh, a chime rings from your belts, indicating that your time in this world is nearly through. What do you do?
Justin: Please!
[audience members: “Lup!”]
Magnus: Lup?
Justin: What?
Griffin: Uh, Lup starts to catch fire with her hands, and she says
Lup: No, we burn down his casino, as long as we take away his money power, I don’t— we don’t gotta murder him.
Travis: I cut off his ear.
Lup: HOLY SHIT!
[audience laughs]
Lup: Okay, that one’s actually good.
Justin: Uh, don’t forget to do the thing.
Clint: Oh! I use the, the, the—
Justin: Wand.
Clint: Wand of de-curse-uration—
Justin: De-curse-uration, yes.
Clint: And I remove the curse from… something.
Griffin: You— you pick up the locket. Lup says
Lup: Mission accomplished! And just in time!
Griffin: All of you are starting to—
Travis: I toss him his ear back. I don’t want it, it’s gross.
Griffin: All of you are starting to sort of get spirited away back to your home, and Merle, you take this wand and tap it to the locket, and the wand glows green for just a moment, and when that light fades, you can see, just as you’re about to be pulled away, that—
Clint: There’s no place like home, there’s no place like home…
Justin: Okay, we’re gonna go ahead and let Griffin— go ahead.
Griffin: You can see that your hands are empty. [audience reacts] And Lup, seeing this, says
Lup: SON OF A—
Griffin: And then all of you are teleported away. [music] And then we see the front of the Grand Grimaldis Casino, fire alarms are blaring and fancily-dressed folks are running out the doors, trying to get to safety, and the casino security personnel are evacuating, too, and we see one of those security crew members, a young man with bushy red hair make a beeline for the crowd of visitors, disappearing into the mass. And then he reappears on the other side, only now he is not wearing a security uniform anymore. You see Terry walking confidently away from the casino in a sharp black tuxedo, and in front of him, a green light begins to materialize, and he smiles and reaches into the light, and he retrieves the prize you just teleported right into his hands: a wrinkled fifteen-dollar bill. And he delicately folds it and places it into his breast pocket, and, turning away from the flaming casino, he looks directly into the camera.
And he winks.
That is the end of our adventure, thank you so much for coming! Goodbye!

[“Déjà Vu” by Mort Garson]
Travis: Hey everybody, let’s give it up for the Mardi Griddler! [Mardi Gras + Riddler, describing Clint’s outfit that night.]
Griffin: Did you say... did you say Mardi Griddler?
Travis: I did.
Griffin: That sounds like a Denny’s menu item.
Travis: And he’s dressed like a Denny’s menu item!
Griffin: I think he looks amazing.
[Audience cheers]
Travis: Wait. Oh, yeah, it was Dad. It was Clint the whole time.
Clint: It was me the whole time!
Travis: Now, you’re probably wondering, “What is this new direction that Clint is taking Merle?” Well...
Clint: Well, my costume didn’t arrive.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: Didn’t it?
Griffin: We don’t wanna throw any shade at the organization responsible for this, U.S. Postal Service...
Justin: But not, I should be clear, stamps.com, which is a fantastic provider. [Clint laughs] Of all your postal needs—
Travis: It’s like the post office without all the late packages.
Griffin: Yes. Uh, y’all ready?
Justin: Hell yes.
Griffin: Are y’all ready? Let’s do it.
[Audience cheers]
Justin: Fucking crank it. So catch us up.
Griffin: Uh, no. So... [Audience laughs] it’s the apocalypse. [They all groan] Man!
Justin: We already beat it!
Griffin: Well, it’s a different one.
Travis: Aw, man!
Justin: Must be Saturday!
Griffin: There were a few insistent soothsayers that nobody was really taking seriously for that exact reason: we just beat the apocalypse, what are the odds that it’s gonna happen again? As fate would have it, the odds are quite good.
Travis: There have to be some hipsters though, who were like, “I’ve seen an apocalypse.”
Griffin: “I was here for the OG apocalypse.” Over the course of an evening, the laws of nature that sustained your world were seemingly revoked one by one. The seas stood still, then retreated. Every tree in the forest and flower in the field simply leaned over to the ground as if settling in for a long nap.
Travis: Wait, where did the seas go?
Griffin: Just somewhere. It went home? [laughter] The moon, the real one, began shifting through its phases faster and faster like a strobe light, which was hell for all the werewolves in the realm. And in the morning, when you saw the sun plummeting out of the sky, hurtling in your hapless planet’s direction, that’s when you knew those soothsayers were correct. The apocalypse is at your doorstep. What do you do?
[Audience laughs]
Justin: I’m gonna roll to stop... it?
Griffin: Okay.
[Pause]
Justin: That’s a 7, plus, umm...
Travis: Charm? Justin: Charm?
Griffin: You came pretty close? The sun saw you and went, “I don’t, ehh, I’m still gonna keep—” so unfortunately Taako has failed.
Travis: I say we hop on the Starblaster and get the fuck out.
Griffin: [laughing] We’ll try again on the next one.
Justin: We’ve been here before, we out!
Clint: And I say we party!
Griffin: Alright!
[Audience cheers]
Travis: You know what, I was about to give him shit, but that is what Merle would do. [Griffin: Yeah] Like, all right I’ve been saving this extra-powerful booze—
Clint: Fiiiive thousand party points.
Justin: Time to burn all those spell slots on pyrotechnics. What are we doing when we notice this happening? Travis: So, I would probably, like, call for Istus?
Justin: Okay, so what are we doing when we notice this happen?
Griffin: Magnus is calling for Istus.
Magnus: Istus!... Istus!
Griffin: He is hollering out for Istus, the goddess of fate—
Magnus: — Istus.
Griffin: —for the people on stage who don’t remember who Istus is. And just as the heat and the light of the oncoming sun become too horrible to bear, there is a long strand of yarn that entwines all of you, and then the light just takes over everything that you can see.
And when the light fades, you are not wherever you were when you were watching the apocalypse come. You are standing in front of a large, but still pretty quaint, cottage in middle of a large, beautiful field. The sun is high in the sky, just floating in this gorgeous blue sky. And if you didn’t know any better, you would swear this was heaven. The door to the cottage swings open, and out steps Istus, goddess of fate. And she says,
Istus: [pause][weakly, sounding exhausted] What’s up?
[Audience laughs]
Magnus: Uh, the apocalypse?
Istus: [pause] Right, yeah, yeahyeahyeah. That’s, uh, yeah. You were hollering for me— that’s— yes, I’m caught up now. Um. So, how’s it hangin’?
Taako: Well, pretty bad. I mean, um... apocalypse!
Istus: Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I literally forgot from three seconds ago.
Taako: Yeah, for sure. No worries.
Istus: That— I’ll be straight with you all, that one’s on us. Yuh-oh... spaghettios. [Audience laughs] The whole fabric-of-reality-coming-undone thing that’s, um, not a big problem? [a beat] It’s just, the gods have abandoned you all? Um—
Magnus: I knew it!
Istus: — just like, temporarily, not intentionally, that’s why I said, “Yuh-oh.”
Merle: Spaghettios?
Istus: Spaghettios, yeah.
Griffin: She takes a moment to wince and kind of, like, rub her temples. And she says,
Istus: Okay, so I was having a casual party over here? It was more like a chill hang sesh between a few buds here in the celestial plane. Wine and cheese, that sort of deal. And then at some point in the night, it did... get a little out of hand.
Magnus: Uh-huh?
Griffin: And that’s when you look around the yard that you’re standing in and you realize that it’s a fucking mess.
Travis: Just solo cups everywhere.
Griffin: Solo cups are— solo chalices are laying everywhere. [Travis and the audience laugh] There’s empty bottles, some discarded clothes here and there. In the bushes outside her house, you see what appears to be just like, a dude passed out in the bushes. And she explains,
Istus: Okay, so we had an uninvited guest show up, and um. The hang sesh got way rowdier than is responsible. Yeah, so that’s— again, the whole— guys, whoopsie. Yuh-oh. I can’t say it enough. Yuh-oh, yuh-oh, yuh-oh, yuh-oh, yuh-oh. Please, yuh-oh.
Magnus: Okay, well, get back... to work? Istus: Here’s the problem: it’s tough. [mimics explosion noise] It’s tough. [everyone laughs] Okay, so the god who showed up and it got kinda tazy, there was, uh... Okay, so there’s gods for everything up here, right? God of fate, there’s a god of weather—
Magnus: God of dogs?
Istus: God of dogs. Sun god, moon god. There’s a dairy god. The one who showed up and turned the heat up, if you will, was the god of parties.
[Audience cheers]
Magnus: I don’t want to tell you how to do your job, but how did you not expect him to show up?
Justin: Yeah.
Istus: He didn’t RSVP on the G-Cal invite. G-Cal stands for God Calendar. [Audience laughs] It’s what we use up here. Merle, you’re a man of the faith, surely you know about the god of parties.
Merle: Oh, yeah!
Magnus: He’s cosplaying as him!
[Audience laughs then cheers]
Clint: It’s either Larry...
Justin: Wait, wait, wait. Now, who’s [crosstalk] this? Who’s this talking?
Clint: [crosstalk] God of parties...
Travis: [crosstalk] Use his voice.
Justin: Who’s this that’s talking? Clint: Oh, that was me talking.
Justin: Okay, so Clint is in the celestial plane.
Griffin: Why does this keep happening?
Justin: In this plane, there is a god— so Clint McElroy—
Travis: Clint is a godwalker!
Justin: Clint is a god. And he’s walking past—
Clint: — I think we’ve established that I walk the planes!
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: No, we have not established your celestial nature. And now I have to give you a godhood, and it’s the god...
Clint: That’s too complicated. ‘Cause that would make you the son of god.
Griffin: Well?
Justin: Not far off.
Travis: [exclaims] Well, it’s time we reveal ourselves!
Justin: So let’s retcon. Clint gives us a hearty wave, and then Merle toddles up next to us. And we realize we never see Dad and Merle in the same place. [crosstalk] And then Merle says...
Travis: And then Merle says...
Merle: It’s either Larry...
[Audience cheers]
Travis: Do not applaud him for doing the base level of effort!
Justin: You people paid a lot of money to be here, and this is the least he could do. For the no money that we give him to be here.
[Audience laughs]
Merle: ... or Bacchus. Is it Bacchus? [Audience cheers] Did I get that? Jim Bacchus!
Istus: It was. But then the position was recently given... to Reggie Fitzpatrick.
Magnus: Never heard of him.
Taako: Yeah, it’s a new one on me.
Merle: Reggie Fitzpatrick.
Istus: [exhausted] God of parties, Reggie Fitzpatrick. You didn’t learn about this in god school?
Merle: I missed the last semester.
Istus: Legend goes Reggie threw a shindig so badass that when he regained consciousness the next day, he found himself here, in the celestial plane, and was granted a realm of his own to govern as the divine champion of all parties.
Taako: Excuse me?
Istus: Yes.
Taako: Sidebar.
Istus: Mm.
Taako: Does that go for pretty much anything? Like, if I do yo-yo so good, could I black out and wake up as the yo-yo god?
[Clint laughs]
Istus: I’d like to see you do tricks better than Joe-Yo, the current—
Taako: That’s a good pull. Nice!
Istus: It’s his name, I don’t...
Taako: No, it’s nice, good. Joe-Yo, nice!
Magnus: What about the frozen yogurt god?
Merle: Fro-Yo Joe!
Taako: Fro-Yo Joe!
Istus: So anyway—
Taako: What about the god of low flow toilets? Low-Flow Joe?
Istus: Legend says, Reggie Fitzpatrick threw such a righteous party that he himself became righteousness. [dramatic pause] Anyway, Reggie showed up last night, the whole thing got a little too wild, and everyone here is more hungover than any being, immortal or otherwise, has ever been, anywhere, ever, in all of existence.
Thing is... gods can’t get hangovers. Technically speaking, we can’t get drunk. There was some sort of ritual or curse that Reggie did on us that just got us totally shadracked. So I need you to go up to Reggie’s realm, find out what happened at the party last night that has left the whole pantheon in such a sorry state— [gets choked up and stops abruptly]
Merle: Did you—
Magnus: Did you urp?
Merle: A little urp there? Istus: I would go to Reggie’s realm myself and make inquiries, but first off, I need to go barf forever. [Audience laughs] And second off, gods aren’t allowed to confront other gods here in the celestial plane. It’s forbidden.
Magnus: Okay, you should try a little Hair of the Cerberus.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: I don’t— oh, okay.
Justin: Before she goes, I’m going to make an... Arcana check? [Griffin: Okay.] To see if I can pick up any other sort of like... I dunno. I have a plus 6, so.
Griffin: Yeah, hit it.
Justin: And it’s a 2. Nope. Don’t see nothing. Hey—
Taako: Hey y’all? She sick.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: I’m gonna roll a carpentry check real quick. I’m just real quick gonna carve her a wastebasket to throw up in.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: It’s a 19.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: That’s pretty good.
Magnus: [trilling as he “makes” a basket] Rrrrrup! Throw up in— If you’re gonna spew, [Griffin: Yeah.] spew into this.
Justin: Nice! Nice, nice, nice.
Clint: And I’m going to Investigate A Mystery.
Justin: Nope!
Griffin: Wrong, game, Mac!
Justin: Wrong game! Wrong game! Take that back to Chicago. Back to Chicago.
[Everyone laughs]
Griffin: Shit.
Clint: Sorry.
Griffin: She says,
Istus: Oh god, before you go. One problem—
Merle: No, you’re the god.
Istus: Yeah, me. Uh— [in realization] oh, me.
Justin: [laughs] Yeah, “oh me”. [He and Travis laugh]
Istus: Yeah, one problem Merle— all your powers are inherited from your devotion to your chosen deity, and he’s having himself a rough morning too.
Griffin: And with that the figure that was laying in the bushes pops up and you see it’s Pan. [Audience cheers] And he rubs his eyes and stumbles over in your direction with some twigs and some leaves sticking out of his hair—
Travis: How do you tell the difference between twigs that are supposed to be there and those that aren’t?
Griffin: That’s a good point. Merle you would know, he’s got extra twigs. [Audience laughs] And he walks up to the three of you and he gives you a solemn nod and he says,
Pan: I believe I have thrown up on the Tapestry of Fate.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: [laughs] That explains a lot!
Justin: [laughing] About 2016 on!
[Griffin laughs; Audience laughs and cheers; Clint giggles]
Griffin: And, uh, Istus looks-
Travis: You got there!
Griffin: It’s good!
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Istus just looks very disappointed for a moment and she says,
Istus: Merle if you want to use any of your cleric abilities your link with Pan is going to have to be a bit more tangible than usual. Keep him close, find out what Reggie did to make us so party hard that all of our bones hurt, and find a way to fix it.
Merle: [sighs] Ok that’s, that’s— Pan, come— come on.
Travis: And he hops on your back!
Merle: Come on. Come on, little buddy.
Pan: [slurring] Merle Chigh-hurch, my man.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: We have spent the last couple days in New Orleans, so Griffin is cosplaying as himself at this point.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Travis is doing what we like to call “kidding on the square” a little bit. So the three of you follow a very groggy Pan who leads you out of Istus’s realm.
Travis: But it takes like three tries, “No, no, no wait. Wait-wait, ah— eh— come this way—”
Griffin: [laughs] “I don’t know the magic words”. And out into the celestial nexus which connects all the different domains that each god calls home. You see dozens of these bridges all stemming out from a central cloud platform at the end of each one. You see disparate biomes: at the end of one, a world of fire and lava; at the end of another, an undersea castle; at another, a blood-soaked battlefield; a-t another, a mighty forge.
And despite the size and infrastructural complexity of this place it is completely empty. This space, this plane of the gods, is completely silent save for one domain at the end of a bridge you are currently crossing.
At the end of this bridge you see an enormous golden fence that stretches upward into eternity. At its center, in front of where the bridge terminates, you see a diamond encrusted gate flanked by two flood lights shining upward onto it. Immediately adjacent to that is a booth staffed by an enormous Minotaur. And extending far, far into the distance is a line of deities and demigods and other celestial beings all waiting for entry beyond the gate. And as you approach, you hear the sound of muffled, distant, pulsating, powerful electronic music, and shouts in unison alongside it.
Travis: Could you make some of that music for us right now?
Griffin: [starts to mimic an electronica beat but stops]— well it’s muffled so [continues sounds but softer and away from his mic]. [Audience laughs and cheers] And the Minotaur looks up from a book he’s reading and he says,
Minotaur: [in a deep, tough voice] Line starts back there fellas. I’d bring a magazine because it’s gonna be a bit.
Travis: I hand him infinite money that we earned from saving all the universes.
[Audience cheers]
Minotaur: [A beat] Nope. [Travis and audience laugh] Got no need for money. Got the sweetest job in the world. Just me, and my stories.
Taako: What uh, what’s your gig?
Minotaur: I watch the gate.
Taako: Watch the gate to keep out... gods?
Minotaur: Yeah and if they are, uh get a little rowdy, I do this cool thing where I throw them at the ground so hard, they bounce. So I just went ahead and started to call myself a bouncer. What do you think of that?
[Audience laughs]
Magnus: I’m cool with it.
Taako: Yeah it’s good. So you just beat up the gods?
Minotaur: [A beat] Yeup.
[Audience laughs]
Taako: [laughs] You must be like, so wicked strong, right?
[A pause; Justin and the audience laugh as Griffin does something on stage]
Justin: [laughing] That’s a good audio— that’s a good audio one, Griffin, that’s good.
Griffin: Sorry, sorry. I referenced my pecs.
[Audience laughs]
Justin: Also our dad is wearing a purple and yellow suit. [Griffin and the audience laugh] Just to call back. So you know... it’s like—
Clint: There’s green in it, too.
[Audience cheers]
Justin: [crosstalk] There’s green in it too—
Clint: [crosstalk] Actually I’d say green is the predominant—
Justin: [crosstalk] — and diamonds, kind of a harlequin—
Travis: It really makes his eyes pop.
Griffin: Sure, his purple and yellow eyes.
Magnus: Well what if, uhh... I out-stronged you?
Minotaur: [skeptical] Aw, come on.
Magnus: I'm pretty strong.
Minotaur: [still hesitant] I throw gods to the ground and it's so hard that they bounce and—
Magnus: Yeah, but... [smug] I'm pretty strong.
[Justin and audience laugh]
Minotaur: Why don't you just line up like everyone else? It's just gonna be a couple eons.
Travis: [rolls his dice] Whoops.
Merle: Who else is in—
Griffin: Woah, woah, woah, what was that? Hey, what was that roll?
Travis: That was a 9.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: But!
Griffin: No, that's a 26 on my end.
Travis: Plus 8!
Griffin: Okay. You are bounced to the ground.
Travis: Then I try again!
Griffin: You are actually bounced all the way across the bridge and the rest of you stand there uncomfortably while Magnus walks all the way back. [Clint and audience laugh] You bounced off a cloud, so take 18 points of bludgeoning cloud damage.
Travis: Fine, that's fine.
Griffin: It's a cumulonimbus, the thickest cloud there is!
Travis: Oh, okay, alright!
Justin: The most dangerous of clouds!
Clint: So—
Magnus: Again!
Taako: No, no stop—
Travis: 2! [Audience laughs]
Griffin: I got a 31 that time. You’re— You— Fucking Istus is like scrubbing the Tapestry of Fate, and you come smashing through her window, like,
[Audience laughs]
Istus: How's it going?
Magnus: Not great.
[Audience laughs]
Istus: Cool.
Merle: [to the minotaur] So what if we were to give you a god that you could play with all the time to bounce around [Audience laughs] and smack around and do whatever you wanted to do?
Travis: Are you going to kill Pan?!
[Audience laughs]
Clint: He's a god!
Travis: You were just, no joke, 30 seconds ago explicitly told to keep him near you. [Audience laughs] So that your [mocking] uh-powers worked.
Justin: Yeah, I don't know what we'd do without Dad's spellcasting ability [Griffin and audience laughs]. Thank you. Griffin, I do want to thank you for that, which I assume was intentional just to set me up for that joke that I've been waiting to deploy until that exact moment.
Griffin: Yeah, and with that Pan disappears now that Justin's joke has been— no. Pan's still there.
Magnus: Hey, I'll tell you what—
Griffin: And the Minotaur says,
Minotaur: I'm not one of the Mon-Stars, I don't wanna just dribble a dude around all day. It's my job.
Magnus: Let me try this.
Minotaur: Yep.
Magnus: You like bouncing gods, right?
Minotaur: Again, I like reading books, and I like the sound of rain against the roof of my booth—
Magnus: But you like your job?
Minotaur: Yeah...
Magnus: What if all the gods went away and you didn't have a job anymore?
Minotaur: [resigned] Yeah.
Magnus: That'd be a bummer right?
Minotaur: It'd be pretty bad.
Magnus: Well if you don't let us through, there will be an apocalypse, and all the gods will die, and you won't have a job anymore.
Taako: Well, there will be other, worse things than that if the apocalypse occurs. Like you'll be dead, also. [Audience laughs] Cause it's like, the apocalypse.
Magnus: Okay, that's a fair point as well.
Merle: And no more books.
Taako: All your favorite shows will be cancelled. [Minotaur: Yeah.] All your houseplants will die. The banks will be closed all the time, and you'll be dead.
[Audience laughs]
Minotaur: Yeah.
Taako: So four terrible things.
Minotaur: I mean, we've ridden out a couple apocalyses— capocalyses— What is it?
[Audience laughs]
Magnus: Bad times.
Minotaur: We've ridden out some bad times up here.
Magnus: Yeah, we stopped most of them.
Minotaur: That was you guys??
Magnus: That was us. This is Taako, from TV.
[Audience cheers]
Merle: This is Magnus Sideburns.
Magnus: Nope. [audience cheers] So close.
Minotaur: Listen, I— I'll be honest. I vaguely remember hearing about that. It's so loud...
Travis: I attack him again.
Justin: No, come on. It's not gonna work.
Travis: No, I don't.
Minotaur: It's so loud here, I only— I caught bits and pieces, something about a magic jellyfish.
Magnus: Yeah. That's the only thing that matters.
Taako: So can I go past you?
Griffin: Roll a persuasion check, Taako. And Magnus. You all were both sort of making the case together. [Audience laughs] Oh, Justin's dice is flashing.
Justin: Yeah, die flashing, it's a 20.
Travis: Thank god!
[Audience cheers and applauds]
Minotaur: You know what, as much as I would like more time to read my special books—
Magnus: There would've been time now.
[Audience laughs]
Minotaur: If they all get blown up in the apocalypse, well that's not great. So, uh, go on through.
Griffin: And he presses a button underneath his booth and the diamond gate swings open.
Taako: Nice! Minotaur: Be safe. Be smart. Hey look at me... be safe, be smart.
Clint: So we solved your literate Minotaur [pronounced “Mine-o-tour”] puzzle.
Griffin: [offended] All— most Minotaurs [pronounced “Mine-o-tour”] are literate! That's hateful!
Justin: Why is everyone saying Minotaur [pronounced “Mine-o-tour”]!?
Travis: What’s happ— Because otherwise it’s “Your-a-tour”.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: That wasn’t— Don't laugh at that.
[Audience laughs again]
Griffin: Yeah, you all—
Travis: I didn't deserve that. I know when a joke is good.
Clint: Apparently not.
Travis: [crosstalk] No, I don't...
Clint: No, you don't.
Griffin: As you all walk through, the Minotaur looks at Pan and says,
Minotaur: Hey, Pan.
Griffin: And Pan says,
Pan: What’s up, Jerry.
Griffin: You all walk through the gate and as you do this enormous crystalline column extends down from a cloud platform above you. It hits the ground with a quiet “poof” and then the side of the column facing you slides open. [proudly] It’s a heaven crystal elevator, my greatest creation to date.
[Audience cheers]
Travis: Now Griffin, because this is a party kingdom I assume there’s been some drink service between getting through the gate and getting to the elevator.
Griffin: Not yet, which makes you think something's gone terribly wrong [Travis: Okay.] in the heaven party kingdom. You all rise far above the nexus and then pass for a minute through this cloud platform. The whole time this techno music is just getting louder. [mimics an electronica beat increasing in volume]
Travis: [Also starts to mimic a beat]
Griffin: And then— [Travis continues to mimic a beat] Is that ‘The Girl from Ipanema’ but techno?
Travis: [crosstalk] It is, but like an EDM version.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, it’s good, it’s good, it’s good. And then there it is, a massive, neon-streaked, spotlit, towering complex bearing the name of Reggie’s sacred domain... Reggie Town.
Justin: So, what time last night did you write that one?
[Travis laughs]
Travis: And then the story gets weird.
Justin: [laughing] It was a weird night, and all kind of weird things—
Travis: And there were bad monsters, like loud neighbors.
Griffin: Ten skeletons come out, time to get ‘em.
[Everyone laughs]
Justin: Is that anything?
Griffin: You’re joking. Here’s the next sentence: You’re awestruck by the gaudiness of this building. And then you realize that before you are two gigantic, velvet covered doors guarded by an even bigger Minotaur with an even bigger line of people waiting to get in.
[Audience cheers, someone (Travis?) slow claps]
Travis: I’m so tired, I need to eat more King Cake for fuel.
Griffin: Pause the adventure. Everybody picture a number in your mind, and that number represents how many King Cakes you think we have back stage because we’re fuck ups. [pauses] It’s five.
Clint: Not anymore...
Griffin: Uh-oh.
Travis: Dad pooped a King Cake, and now it’s six.
Justin: Dad gave birth to a King Cake. So tell me more about the gaudiness of this building.
Travis: And the second exact same puzzle we need to solve.
Griffin: Hey, Hey! Cool it!
Justin: Mine was a joke.
Griffin: [in a defensive tone] The Minotaur’s way bigger this time.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: We just walk under it.
Justin: See, ‘cause gaudiness. [A joke about the first syllable sounding like “god”]
Griffin: Oh, I getcha!
Justin: That’s nothing.
Griffin: No.
[Audience laughs]
Justin: [in response to someone in the audience] Shut up, Paul!
[Griffin, Clint and audience laugh]
Justin: Don’t make me come off stage!
Griffin: This Minotaur—
Justin: [giggling] He doesn’t need to bellow his laughter— [choking back laughter] —at me, when I’m—
Clint: [in an accent] Oh, that’s a good one captain—
Griffin: This even bigger Minotaur says:
Second Minotaur: [in a very deep, throaty voice] Back of the line!
All: What?
Second Minotaur: [more clearly] Back of the line!
Taako: Okay, where are you trying— where are you keeping us from?
Second Minotaur: [pause][enthusiastically] Reggie Town!
[Audience laughs]
Taako: I bet— so it’s so cool, I bet you couldn’t even go in if you wanted to.
Second Minotaur: [pause] Too big!
Taako: Why— show— [stammering]
Magnus: It’s cool my dude, it’s probably hard to get in.
Taako: Yeah.
Merle: Yeah!
Taako: Are you too lame that you can’t even walk— [crosstalk]
Magnus: It’s fine, some people are too lame, it’s alright.
Griffin: One of the people in line says:
Concerned Partygoer: Leave him alone! Get to the back of the line!
Travis: I push that person off the bridge.
Taako: If this guy is so cool, I wanna see him go through the gate, if he’s so cool.
Griffin: Roll a... roll a “mean” check.
[Audience laughs]
Justin: It’s a 17 plus... persua— it’s a 17.
Griffin: M‘kay. Yeah. [a little sad] He tries to get through the door. He just can’t do it, he’s such a big Minotaur—
Travis: We walk under his legs through the door.
Griffin: [chuckles] Okay, roll a stealth check, everyone.
Travis: Oh okay, I rolled a 12 plus, uh, let me check my—
Griffin: The only half-rogue in the group.
Travis: 22.
Griffin: You’re good.
Taako: Let me— you can get through there. Try again. Here let me, um... I can transmute some of the gate into like water or something, so you can get through.
Travis: Or you could make him smaller, do you have a en-small-ing—
Clint: Yeah, make him small-ified.
Taako: Hold on. I have magic powers, one sec.
[Audience laughs and cheers]
Justin: I open— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m already on the other side. I rolled a 22 stealth.
Justin: [crosstalk] I open a comically large spellbook and sit on the ground.
[Griffin laughs]
Taako: One sec, hold on. I have magic powers, one sec.
Clint: Merle is going to... sneak in as well.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay. Let’s get that—
Travis: [crosstalk] I bet he won’t!
Clint: He’s stealthy. [pause] Um... 13 plus stealth...
[A long pause, audience laughs]
Travis: Also packed in that box was his knowledge of D&D.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: 16.
Griffin: Yeah. 16 works.
Clint: Really?
Griffin: He’s a big... [audience cheers loudly] he’s the biggest boy.
Travis: All Dad was missing this whole time was my dice.
Griffin: He’s the biggest boy and you are a ‘lil—
Clint: [crosstalk] I’m a little, tiny little— yeah.
Griffin: [crosstalk] You get right in there. Taako.
Justin: I’m going to... cast Enlarge-slash-Reduce, but the reduce part. [Griffin: Oh, okay.] I’m tryin’ to shrink him.
Travis: He’s gonna cast Reduce-slash-Reuse-slash-Recycle.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Uh... 14 plus my spellcasting modifier, which is... 5?
Griffin: Yeah, that hits big boy, any stat.
Taako: Alright, now you can go through. Go, enjoy your party!
Griffin: How little did you make him? What are the parameters—
Justin: [crosstalk] You only shrink him down one size.
Clint: So he’s now a junior petite—
Travis: [crosstalk] Instead of being big, he’s... mm-okay.
Justin: His size is halved in all dimensions.
Griffin: Okay. He is now about the size of the first Minotaur you that came across. [Audience laughs] And he makes it through the door and he says:
Second Minotaur: I never thought I’d see the day!
Justin: And I pull out the Wand of Switcheroo. [Audience laughs] And I, uh, I use it on him.
Clint: Aww. Give it up!
[Audience laughs and cheers]
Justin: My thing was gonna be so good, I don’t know why he couldn’t get through the gate! I had a whole thing and he couldn’t get through the gate. Anyway, Wand of Switcheroo, it’s a 16. Oh, no sorry, it’s a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.
Griffin: I rolled a critical failure.
Justin: Okay.
Travis: He switches places back to Earth!
Justin: That un-dramatic... I could’ve just like, pushed him out of the way at that point.
Griffin: With a critical failure, you all switch places. Now you’re all inside the club, and he says:
Second Minotaur: Hey, wait a minute!
Griffin: And then the doors, I think, automatically swing shut, but as they do, you see him fall through the clouds. [Audience makes unhappy noises] But then that concerned party in line grabs his hand at the last second. A new friendship is forged! [Audience cheers]
Justin: It’s Elvis— he’s been dead the whole time!?
Griffin: You step foot into Reggie Town, and boys, it has... everything. It’s unlike any party you’ve ever attended, which might have certain hospitalities or fun activity centers all built around a certain cause or theme. In Reggie Town, there doesn’t appear to be much cohesion, or perhaps the design is far more complex than your minds can possibly conceive of. There’s a dance floor, of course, although it’s more like a dance pit surrounded by speakers, a technicolor LED floor pulsating below—
Travis: That sounds terrible.
Griffin: There’s a booth with two robot-masked DJs mixing music using this giant, golden Boom Box above. [pause] It’s basically Daft Punk. [Audience cheers] There is... every food, all food imaginable; fondues, chocolates, champagne, and various other edible and potable liquids— [crosstalk]
Travis: Sandwiches?
Griffin: Liquid sandwiches are emitted from a massive fountain around the dining station—
Travis: [shrieking] WHAT?!
Griffin: Just one fountain! All with different flavors, branching off in discrete streams. [pause] I got so excited when I thought of that.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: [mildly dumbfounded] Liquid sandwiches?
Griffin: As you’re distracted by that, a pegasus rides by with two cheering partygoers on its back. Actually, retcon, it’s Garyl, and he’s like,
[Audience cheers]
Garyl: Heyyy! [Audience cheers] You made it.
Griffin: And then he takes off. There are private booths suspended on platinum chains from the ceiling. Inside them you see people playing Twister, one where people are hookah-ing it up, one where there’s people doing karaoke. And all around the perimeter of the room, there’s little satellite parties, splintering off the main one. Even those satellite parties are bigger and cooler than any party you’ve ever attended. [with increasing speed and enthusiasm] There’s a Fourth of July pool party; there’s a kid birthday party complete with clown; there’s even a wake and it’s popping off too!
[Audience laughs and cheers]
Travis: That’s the best line Griffin has ever written in The Adventure Zone, hands down.
Justin: But it’s sad too, because you can tell this show has become the tortured fantasies of dads. Cuz it’s like “I bet other parties are happening in other places—”
Travis: [crosstalk] “And everyone else is having a great time! And you wish you were there!”
Justin: [crosstalk] “And everyone’s having a great time!” They’re like, “Where’s my friend Griffin, I sure miss him ever since he had a kid.”
Travis: I just would love to see a wake where someone’s like, “Listen it’s really sad about Jim, but... this is a fucking great party!”
Griffin: Yeah!
[Audience laughs]
Travis: “I’m kinda glad Jim died.”
Griffin: Yeah. The Black Eyed Peas are here. [Audience laughs] And suddenly, inches away from you, a circular bar just appears. The bartender, who is just a handsome, rugged angel, wipes the counter with a rag, then eyes the four of you over, and says,
Bartender: You four look like you’ve had a hard day. Fancy a drink?
Taako: Yes!
Magnus: No.
Merle: Ehhh...
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: He goes over to this golden keg and taps it, and pours a beverage. He says,
Bartender: It’s Reggie’s favorite. He uh... he calls it ‘Brosia. [a play on the slang term ‘bro’, and ambrosia.][Justin laughs] It’s one part god nectar, one part grenadine, two parts Michelob Ultra.
[Audience laughs]
Clint: Mmm. That is the apocalypse.
Griffin: He puts it on the bar and slides it towards you, Taako.
Taako: [excitedly] Yes!
Griffin: [laughs] Okay.
Taako: Good, yes! Drinks!
Griffin: It tastes about how you think it would taste!
Taako: Hell yeah, good as hell, right?
Griffin: Good as hell and pretty low-cal, thanks Michelob Ultra!
Travis: Magnus doesn’t drink.
Griffin: Okay, that’s Magnus’ choice.
Bartender: So what brings you all to Reggie Town? You looking for anything in particular? You need any glow sticks, any lobster tails?
Magnus: Yes!
Griffin: Okay. He hands you—
Magnus: I would like a glowing lobster tail, please.
Griffin: Boom! He has it.
Clint: And suddenly, out of the back of Magnus comes a glowing lobster tail.
Griffin: Woah!
Bartender: That's how I do it.
Taako: What's the— first off, what's your handle, partner?
Bartender: Staven.
Taako: Staven?
Staven: Yep.
Clint: Wow.
Taako: Hey Staven, what do you think about the new boss?
Staven: [slyly] You talking about Reggie Fitzpatrick?
Taako: Hell yeah I am, fool.
Staven: To be honest...
Taako: Yeah?
Staven: Between friends?
Taako: Uh huh.
Magnus: Yep.
Staven: He doesn't come around very much.
Taako: Yeah.
Merle: That can be a good thing.
Taako: Absentee boss, good.
Staven: Yeah, but he'll know if something goes wrong.
Magnus: Have you... ever met him?
Staven: A couple times. Listen, what you got to understand about Reggie: he only shows up when the party is wild enough. If you want to see him tonight, this party's really got to pop off. Right now, it's about a five. But I don't think it's gonna hit a ten if you wanted to see Reggie tonight.
Magnus: We need to party.
Taako: Well, I hope it gets better. Can we just sit here?
Staven: Sure.
Taako: Alright. [a beat, audience laughter, blows a raspberry] Is it getting— what's this?
Staven: It's about a four point five now.
Taako: Oh, it's gone down.
Staven: Having five just sort of strangers standing around a bar and not saying anything—
Taako: [crosstalk] It's yucking everybody out. Yeah it's a bad vibe.
Staven: [crosstalk] It's kind of reduced the ambiance a little bit.
Travis: Okay, Magnus pulls out a magical Stone of Farspeech that he has that he's never used.
Taako: Oh, come on.
Travis: And he calls LMFAO.
[Audience laughter]
Justin: They're broken up, they can't come.
Travis: Oh no.
Griffin: They say,
LMFAO: [into his hand to muffle it, like it’s coming from the stone] We've broken up, stop calling! It's not gonna happen Magnus!
Justin: But you do have a two-way line so you can get the two of them talking apparently.
Travis: Wait yeah, no, no.
Magnus: Ey— have you guys just tried talkin’ about it?
Justin: I've got one for André 3000 and Big Boi. [laughs]
Griffin: Okay. [audience laughter]
Taako: Hey, I don't need you two to come stop the apocalypse but I would like you to work it out.
Clint: Merle takes off his shirt... [audience cheers] to show his California tattoo over his belly.
Griffin: Fantastic.
Travis: Topical! Some topical humor from Clint McElroy!
Griffin: Roll just sort of a charisma check, Merle. I'll give you advantage on this one, because it's you.
Clint: A charisma check. Okay. [bursts out laughing] That's a threee... [audience laughter] plus oneee... so that tattoo looks really nasty.
Griffin: All these angels on the dance floor are just kinda like bumpin' to the music, they all just turn and look at you while still kinda bumping, and then they get off rhythm a little bit, and then those two DJs, like, do something behind this golden boombox and it gets a little bit louder and more powerful, and everybody gets going again. It dropped down to like a three—
Clint: Yeah?
Griffin: But it got brought up sort of to a neutral five.
Clint: Okay.
Travis: I would like to call—
Griffin: Yes?
Travis: My jellyfish friends.
Griffin: Who is in like another... okay.
Travis: But they know all the music.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: We're on the Astral Plane.
Griffin: No. Celestial Plane. Listen, it's complicated. There's a lot of planes. That one's on me. I'll own that.
Travis: Listen, I would like to call my jellyfish friends who know that intermission is coming up.
Griffin: Okay, sure.
Travis: That's a nat 20.
Griffin: Okay. [audience cheers] Floating through space the two Voidfishes are flying around. By the way, sorry if this is your first episode. Alright listen, there are these things called Voidfishes... [audience laughter] And they can sing to everyone. And they do so. What song is played that kind of overrides what's—
Travis: Party Rock Anthem.
Griffin: Okay, so it is— [audience cheers] Here's what happens. Everybody on the dance floor suddenly starts to go even wilder and you see the two DJs look at each other like, ""What?"", and they're dancing to a different rhythm, a different beat. This music that's flooding everybody's minds, and in response the DJs crank it up even more—
Justin: [crosstalk] Hell, yeah.
Griffin: Going amp for amp against the Voidfishes, turning the party up to a seven.
Justin: I go over to— I stand above where they're all partying and I pull out my... [Griffin: Uh oh.] anti-gravity sphere—
Griffin: Oh, shit!
Justin: And I throw it down at the dance floor.
[Audience cheers]
Taako: Let's fucking party!
Griffin: Yeah, with that I think people get scared when you hover above them and then just sort of throw a big ball down at them. There's not much space for a ball to land safely. It definitely hits a couple angels, but listen. It's necessary losses. You can't have a float party without killing a couple angels.
Justin: It has to shatter for the party to kick off.
Griffin: And it does. You hear some protest against the stricken angels. Perhaps struck is the word I should have gone with there. But then following that all the angels are just floating around in this cool orb. [Justin: Lovin’ it!] And the two DJs are cranking it, they just pump the music to that.
{37:27}
Griffin: And then each like reverberation coming from these speakers sends like shock waves through these dancing sphere of angels. It’s the coolest shit you’ve ever seen. And with that, a beam of light shoots down from the ceiling and a figure begins to descend. It’s a large spray-tanned man. [Audience laughs and cheers] His sunglasses are pushed up to rest on his forehead. And he’s wearing a windbreaker suit of the most fantastical colors. He finds his way down in a T-pose making a perfect gentle landing on the heels of his sneakers. And the crowd and this floating orb looks down, I guess, at him with reverence. And he shouts:
Reggie Fitzpatrick: [yelling, in a loud, gruff voice] Peace be with you, eyyy, let’s get it going! [Audience cheers] Oh shit, is that Pan? That guy is a fucking animal! [Audience laughs] The shit he does down there, the trees and dirt and all that shit, it’s so good. But last night this god proved he’s an awesome god if you know what I’m talking about!
[Clint laughs and audience cheers]
Taako: Hi Reggie!
Reggie: Hey!
Taako: Time to go to the chill-out tent.
Reggie: Those don’t exist up here, it’s Reggie Town! We got a... Hot... up... Tent!
Griffin: And then a Hot-up Tent appears and he’s like:
Reggie: What do ya think about that?
[Justin presumably emotes in some way and the audience laughs]
Taako: Hey um. Bad news, fellas. [a beat] I’m stayin’ here!
[Audience and Griffin laugh]
Travis: And then Reggie’s best friend Ja Rule shows up.
Merle: Let me ask you this—
Reggie: We’re looking for investors for Reggie Town!
Merle: Why do we want to go back to the real world?
Magnus: No, wait! What!?
Merle: This is so awesome!
Reggie: YEES!
Magnus: The real world is where all my stuff is!
Reggie: What’s going on? You all look like you’re in a party [???] so like—
Magnus: We need a hangover cure?
Reggie: A what?
[Justin laughs]
Travis: Now I want to leave Griffin frozen in this gargoyle-esque—
Reggie: Uhhh, a what?
Travis: One more, no, one more!
Reggie: What did you just say?
Clint: [like “boing”] A-doinngg!
Taako: We want to fix the gods, so they’ll uhh, get back to work!
Reggie: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Magnus: They’re all real hungover?
Reggie: That’s not possible. Gods can’t get drunk. They’re not going to be hungover, I don’t understand.
Magnus: You... you showed up your party at Istus’s.
Reggie: Yup
Taako: Check!
Magnus: [crosstalk] And you got gods—
Reggie: [crosstalk] And my entourage.
[Audience cheers]
Taako: Okay, so Turtle got all the gods sick I guess, I don’t know. But you— The gods are hungover, Reggie. You partied... too hard.
Reggie: [a pause][whispering incredulously] The fuck did you just say to me??
[Audience cheers]
Travis: As Griffin fixes his glasses.
Griffin: As you say that, there’s like a dubstep drop in the music, and with that, all of the angels in this dance orb suddenly turn towards you almost in response to the drop. And now all their eyes like, glow red.
Travis: Magnus steps back from Taako.
Griffin: And they’re staring in your direction. Their faces actually look like— [He does something, most likely making a face and the audience laughs]. Their faces look like they’re cracking with this red light behind them. And now they’re all sort of like dancing in formation to this music. [Travis: (???)] to this music— [Travis: I almost lean back but—] It’s all coming from this music that’s just pulsating out of this golden boombox. And the orb starts undulating towards you. And Reggie says:
Clint: [imitating Reggie] Did you just say... “undulate”?
Reggie: Did you just say I... “over-partied”?
Taako: Reggie, I got one question for ya.
Reggie: Yeah?
Taako: Are you taking applications? [Someone snorts and the audience laughs] ‘Cause I could fit in with your org... pretty nicely.
Reggie: I’m in a hard time getting a beat on y—
Griffin: And as he says that, the angels consume him and pull him into the mass of floating dance angels, and then you see Reggie just get flung backwards and into the bottles up against the bar that Staven was working at. And you hear him go:
Reggie: [moving away from the mic] WHAT THE FUUUCK!
Griffin: As he goes smashing through. And then you can can tell like the music is almost like, the beats of the music, the angels are turning towards you with each beat of the music and moving towards you.
Clint: Don’t blink.
Taako: Turns out he was—
[Audience laughs]
Justin(?): Boo. No.
Travis: Wait, hold on, let’s go for the second joke.
Taako: Turns out he was just a slob like one of us.
[Clint and audience laugh]
Travis: And can I try one now?
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Travis: Ah, looks like the rhythm was gonna get ‘im.
Griffin: Okay! [Audience cheers] Let’s fucking roll for initiative!
[Audience cheers]
Travis: 19 plus 2, 21.
Griffin: ‘Kay!
Clint: 13 plus 2, that’s 15, but I get— [Griffin: Yes!] Yeah let’s just stick with the 15.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Justin?
Justin: 16.
Griffin: Okay. First in the order is Magnus. Magnus you have these two robot DJs—
Travis: Did you forget about intermission? ‘Cause that’s when I’m gonna eat dinner.
Griffin: We’re good.
Justin: So hungry.
[crosstalk]
Travis: I’m a hun’gy boy.
Justin: I rolled that my pizza is getting cold backstage.
Griffin: [laughs] The music is pulsating out of this golden jukebox— not golden jukebox, that’d be wild— it’s a golden Boom Box that these DJs are controlling—
Travis: That’s much more timely!
Griffin: —to the beats of the music. The angel orb, which is going to be weird during this whole fight [crosstalk] is coming towards you.
Travis: [crosstalk] Looks like we got ourselves a dance off!
Griffin: Magnus, you are up, what do you do?
Travis: [determined] I dance.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Harder than I have ever danced before.
Griffin: Okay!
Travis: [beat][sarcastically] I rolled a 36!?
Griffin: Oh boy!
[Audience cheers]
Travis: [Rolls a dice] Nope.
Clint: Hm.
Travis: Would that be a dex—
Justin: Did you roll a 5?
Travis: [beat] Plus strength!
Griffin: For dancing?
Clint and Justin: For dancing?
Travis: [laughing] I’m dancing really hard.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: The, uh, you don’t seem to be dancing to the beat of the music and that seems to piss the angels off and it has no other effect. Next in the order is... Taako.
Taako: We’re fighting them?
Griffin: It seems that they want to fight you.
Taako: I don’t want to fight them! I’m good! I’m looking for, like— I wished I dressed a little nicer! [Audience laughs] I want to impress a little bit.
Griffin: Okay. Taako gives his turn! Merle! [Someone pops with their mouth, audience laughs] Merle, does a 24 beat your AC? [beat] Yes, almost certainly it does. [Clint: Yeah?] The dance orb moves towards you and grasping hands pull you inside and now you’re inside this just mass, this floating moshpit of angels. You take—
Clint: I bet that looked pretty damn good with this suit on!
Griffin: If they could see you, it would. You take 28…
Clint: [in disbelief] Huh?
Griffin: You take 28 bludgeoning damage as you are moshed against [Clint: Son of a bitch!] by these angels. And with that—
Clint: Oh, there— now we stop!
Griffin: No, not yet. [Clint: Ah okay.] The Boom Box gets pumped up even louder as it sees Merle sort of consumed by this orb and with that the angels look towards the other two people not consumed yet [in a low voice] and they look so bad, guys. [normally] Taako, you’re back up. Or no— Magnus is back up.
Travis: I use the grappling hook [Griffin: ‘kay.] to pull Merle out.
Griffin: Okay. You succeed, I don’t know how you would roll to satisfy that
Travis: No, it— it just happens.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, you pull Merle out. Merle, how was it in there?
Clint: It was kinda cool! [Griffin laughs] No, no, wait a minute, I know how you young people talk: It was rad!
[Justin, Travis and the audience laugh]
Travis: It was YOLO! [laughter] Uh, and then— [he pauses]
Griffin: Sure! That can be a bonus action.
Travis: Well I get like 18 attacks. [Griffin: Okay.] Then I reach behind the bar and grab like the nozzle that sprays water. Just gonna try to hose him down. [Griffin: Okay.] Just try to— and say something like “Hey. Cool out.”
Griffin: Alright, cool. Hit it.
Travis: Nat 20.
Griffin: Oh shit, okay. [Audience cheers] Okay with that, you spray some of the angels down and it’s way more powerful— I think the power of ‘Brosia is just so much more potent than you even assumed it would be, and this angel orb gets sprayed down and like half of them just kind of like fall to the ground, and just shake and come to their senses.
And the two DJs behind the booth, even though they’re wearing these robot masks, you can just tell from their body language they’re super pissed off. And they pump these sliders behind the boom box to maximum and the music gets louder and louder, and then smoke starts coming out of it. And when that happens, all the remaining floating, dancing angels fall to the ground, and you can see them kinda like shake their heads and start to come to. As the boombox goes up in smoke, just all the energy shifts here in Reggie Town. Pan also like shakes his head and kind of like rubs his temples, and also seems to regain consciousness? And uh...
Travis: And Merle gives him a back rub, yes.
Griffin: Yes, and he’s uh— and the two robot DJs look at each other, and then they shrug. And one of them says from behind their mask,
DJ 1: [in a high, snooty voice] Looks like Pandora’s Boom Box bit the big one, brother.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: And the other DJ says,
DJ 2: [in a lower, snooty voice] Well, uh. It’s a good thing we’re not that easy to get rid of.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: And the second DJ reaches into their pocket and retrieves what appears to be a first generation iPod and presses some buttons on it, and you hear a click. [“Storm Top Dog” by Zachary Wilson begins to play] And the music starts up again. [The music transitions into that iconic Wonderland beat and the audience cheers wildly.]
And the blast of fog envelopes the DJs from on top of their booth. Their helmets fly towards you from within the fog and crash to the floor, and when the smoke clears, you see the faces they previously concealed. The dance floor participants snap back into formation, now mimicking the movements of their puppet masters: the kind of sharp, stylish voguing you’ve come to expect from the Wonderland twins, Edward and Lydia. [Audience cheers] We’ll be right back!
Template:Ad break 47:47 - 52:00
Griffin: Edward and Lydia are voguing with flawless precision [Audience cheers] to the music coming out of the wall of speakers behind them. As the music started back up again, the angel dance crew lifted itself off the floor like a single organism and begins dancing in place, awaiting their chance to strike. And Lydia says,
Lydia: Long time no kill, boys! [Audience cheers] Congrats on making it out of Wonderland, uh, mostly intact— weren’t you a mannequin?
Magnus: Who are you?
[Audience laughs]
Merle: No wait, I’m the one that’s not supposed to remember anything.
Magnus: We’ve fought and killed a lot of people since Wonderland.
Griffin: Uh, they look insulted?
Travis: Yeah. Fuck yeah, they are!
Griffin: They say,
Lydia: [sounding defeated] We were... we did... the whole Wonderland— the whole Wonderland thing. It was really, really, really nasty.
Taako: Oh, you kept fuckin’ up time and making it reset and—
Merle: [crosstalk] Yeah!
Lydia: [crosstalk][defeated] No...
Magnus: Oh, you were the one that was the like, giant swarm of eyeballs that was [crosstalk] eating everything.
Taako: [crosstalk] Eyeball swarm that was eating everything.
Merle: And the worm, the big worm. [crosstalk] The giant worm... thing?
Taako: [crosstalk] You were the big worm.
Lydia: [crosstalk] No…
Taako: [crosstalk] Were you big worms?
Lydia: I thought what we had was special.
Magnus: [laughing] You were the scary train?
[Audience laughs]
Merle: [suddenly, as if having an epiphany] Oh, the one with the spider! [unintelligible crosstalk] You had the spider—
Lydia: [talking over everyone] We had the big wheel, and you spun it, and then you had to do the prisoners dilemma, and it was really psychological and spooky and...
Merle: Mmm...
Magnus: You were the cat that had the shop?
[Audience laughs]
Lydia: We turned you into a mannequin and then you all vaporized us?
Magnus: [simultaneously] Yeahh, okay! Yeah!
Merle: [simultaneously] Yeah! Ohh.
Taako: [simultaneously] Yeahh! Okay.
Lydia: Honestly, for you all to forget after all the work we put into making the fun games for you. To vaporize us, and then forget about us?
Merle: We suck. We really suck.
Magnus: Yeah, anyways, we’re gonna go.
Lydia: [surprised] Oh. See ya. [Griffin chuckles] If we can keep doing what we’re doing here, if you all wanna take off and enjoy...
Taako: No, hey. [Lydia: Yeah.] While I’ve got you. [Lydia: Yes.] What did you do to the gods?
Lydia: Oh, I’m so glad you asked.
Griffin: Edward says,
Edward: So you... zapped us... good. You and your... umbrella sister if I’m remembering correctly.
[Audience cheers]
Taako: Yeah.
Edward: We ended up in the—
Travis: Some Lup fans in the house!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Lydia says,
Lydia: So we came to in the astral plane, which was pretty yucky at the time because of the... Hungry that was happening?
Magnus: Hunger. Hunger.
Lydia: It was a blur, kind of—
Merle: Hangry.
Lydia: It was the Hangry, we had a chance to sneak out, find ourselves in the realm of the gods, and boys, we liked what we saw!
Griffin: And Edward says,
Edward: We figured if we could incapacitate the gods for a bit, planet— [blows raspberry] blows up. That sounded like a toot noise but it was an explosion. [Audience laughs][Magnus: Okay.] Nobody left to worship the gods, they disappear... [slyly] we become the gods!
Taako: [crosstalk] Damn it.
Magnus: [crosstalk] Make money.
Taako: That— can I just say, that’s good.
Edward: Thank you! [Taako: It’s good!] It’s way better than “trap strangers in a torture prison—”
Taako: That was very elaborate.
Edward: And it was sort of— it was mean and it accomplished very little.
Magnus: Yeah. Listen, I’m not gonna tell you how to do your job, [Edward: Yeah.] but it didn’t seem to have any kind of end goal.
Edward: Yeah, yeah, sure. This one totally does.
Lydia: And luckily—
Griffin: — Lydia says—
Lydia: — We had just the right rube to help us with our genius ploy.
Griffin: And at this point you see Reggie stand up behind the bar, and he’s like rubbing his head, and when he hears the twins talking about him, he just looks downcast and he says,
Reggie: [choked up] I uh. I thought y’all loved to party.
Griffin: And Edward says,
Edward: Sweet Reginald, we do, but we love doing evil even more, bud.
Travis: Oh, if that isn’t nature’s greatest struggle. The fight between one’s desire to party and one’s desire to do evil.
Griffin: And Lydia says,
Lydia: Now—
Travis: Oh, I have found myself in many a night.
Griffin: Lydia says,
Lydia: Now, I know... the three of you, four I guess, including Pan, but I’m pretty sure—
Magnus: Don’t include him.
Lydia: Yeah, he’s uh. Sort of a non-factor. I know you’re gonna wanna fight, just knowing you. But, I have a compromise. Hear me out.
Taako: ‘kay.
Griffin: Roll a Wisdom saving throw.
[Audience laughs]
{56:28} 3388/5476
[Rolling dice]
Travis: Nope.
Travis: Uh, I got a 13, total.
Griffin: Bad.
Justin: Hm, 12?
Griffin: That one’s good bad. [Audience laughs]
Clint: 13 plus 3, 16.
Griffin: Good!
[Audience cheers]
Travis: Oh wait, hold on! Indomitable.
Griffin: Okay!
Travis: That is 18 plus 1, 19 [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] You’re good. Taako. You two just see Taako start fucking grooving [Audience cheers] just right there.
Travis: And nothing seems weird!
Griffin: Specifically the target begins a comic dance in place, shuffling, tapping its feet and capering for the duration. Caper, dammit!
[Audience cheers]
Justin: Now, what spell did they cast?
Griffin: They cast Irresistible Dance.
Justin: When— now when will that take effect?
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Griffin: Uh, you can’t move, you’re dancing and, uh—
Justin: Okay, pick one.
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Griffin: You have no movement points. You’re spending all of them on your dancing.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Uh, and you have disadvantage at Dexterity saving throws and Attack rolls.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Uh, and you can roll to save. Where are we at in the order? The last thing it happened was somebody sprayed water up on the [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] I have sprayed water.
Griffin: Next in the order is...
Travis: Taako’s up.
Griffin: —Taako.
Justin: Oh great. Okay.
Griffin: At this point the dance crew has gone sort of, uhh, evil again and is also a threat. It’s not just—
Travis: [chanting the bass line of Thriller] ba dum dum dum dum dum dum ba— like Thriller?
Griffin: They are thrilling it pretty hard, yes. [Audience cheers]
Justin: You know what? I’m just gonna do one of the ones, that hurt people with fire.
[laughter]
Justin: Sometimes!
Travis: He’s doing a keyword search: “fire”! [Audience laughs]
Clint: Hurt people!
Justin: Okay, so I’m gonna go with fireball.
Griffin: Oh, classic. [Audience cheers] I can’t believe you needed to look for five minutes for fireball!
Justin: Well the first 4 minutes and 45 seconds were trying to look for something better [Griffin laughs] and then the last 15 seconds were purely fireball. [Griffin: Okay.] But I’m just gonna cast a fireball. [griffin: Okay.] Wait, no, wait. There’s a twist:
Griffin: Alright.
Justin: At them.
Griffin: Yeah. [Audience laughs]
Justin: To set them [quietly] on fire.
Griffin: Okay. [Audience laughs]
Justin: Dexterity saving throw.
Griffin: [Rolling dice ] Okay. Uh, Lydia rolls a 6, Edward rolls a 13.
Justin: No!
Griffin: These are shit rolls. Okay [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] [???] both. So you are gonna take 8 d6 fire damage on a failed save, um, are there any flammable objects in the area that are being worn or carried? Because that is—
Travis: You did say that there were some curtains.
Griffin: I don’t think I did. [Audience laughs]
Justin: Didn’t remember the curtains.
Travis: Didn’t he describe the bars having curtains?
[Various members of the audience shouts “Yeah” and “Yes”]
Griffin: Okay yeah, there’s curtains.
Justin: Woohoo! [Audience laughs]
Griffin: [in Reggie’s voice] Alright! There’s fucking curtains! [normally] There’re badass party curtains!
[Audience laughs]
Travis: So they’re not flammable?
Justin: [adding up numbers] 24...27...[laughter] 28… 30...34!
Griffin: Woah, okay! They’re—[Audience cheers] You throw a fireball at them and it blasts them and the fucking kickass curtains behind them, uh, and Edwards says,
Edwards: Oooh! I remember this feeling, being not so good. Maybe this was a bad idea.
And Lydia says,
Lydia: No no no, go with it, we got him this time. We know all their tricks!
{1:00:30}
Next in the order is Merle. Uh, roll a wisdom saving throw, Taako, to see if you are still dancing. [Rolling dice]
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Griffin: He’s got— [crosstalk]
Travis:[crosstalk] A 6!
Griffin: He’s still dancing.
Clint: Merle casts Guardian of Faith.
Justin: Yes!
[Audience cheers]
Clint: You got all these angels around, why not use some angels for their own good?
Justin: Yes!
Clint: So, shit.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: What’s wrong, bud?
Travis: It’s a 35!
Griffin: What’d he roll? You have to— I don’t think you have to roll anything. Why’d you say— [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh, I don’t have to roll anything!
Griffin: Why’d you say “shit”?
Clint: [stammering] ‘Cause, ‘cause…
Justin: It’s the language, it’s like out of control.
Clint: I’m so…
Travis: Dookie! Dookie.
Griffin: You see— You see your Della Reese warrior angel and [Audience cheers] she actually pops up out of the crowd of dancing angels and she’s got like a— [chuckling] She’s got like some beads— She has like one of those Raver, like ring pops that she kinda pop— and she pops up and she’s like,
Della Reese: What do you need? [Audience laughs] I’m, I’m busy, Merle!
Merle: I need you to— [Audience cheers] You know what? I don’t want you to stop doing that.
Della Reese: Alright! Bye!
Griffin: And she disappears back into the crowd of angels.
Clint: Wow. [laughing] I suck at this game.
Travis: Like she does attack all the angels around her.
Griffin: With a mosh.
Travis: Yes.
Justin: Yes.
Griffin: With her irresponsible dancing. She picks up on what you need. What do I roll against the angel dance squad? You got this. [Justin laughs, audience cheers and Clint sighs.] What’s the damage?
Clint:20 radiant damage on a failed save.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: What save?
Justin: Dexterity.
Griffin: Okay, it’s a dexterity saving throw. Uh, I rolled an 11 which is not going to save against your spellcasting modifier—
Clint: No, it’s not!
Griffin: Uh, yeah you [Audience cheers] just see her— You just see her now like her dance that she was doing, now becomes like,
[Griffin does something on stage, audience laughs]
Like I’ve never been in a moshpit but I think when you get in it you’re supposed to be like—
Travis: You’ve never been in—? Let’s get some people up here!
Griffin: [Laughing] No.
Clint: No!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: The fire marshal will shut us down.
Travis: You’ve never lived!
Griffin: We’ve done enough live shows for you to know better than to say “rush the stage”!
[Justin and audience laugh]
Griffin: Uh, as she is moshing you see these like, splashes of light every time she elbows another angel on the face and they take 20 radiant damage. Uh, next in the order—
Clint: So I did good, right?
Griffin: Well, I mean they’re— Yes, sure.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Next in the order is, uh, Edward. Edward is just like standing perfectly still and he like, just like flexes this powerful turbo vogue, uh, and it sort of commands the entire angel dance crew to take a dive at... we’ll say Merle. Uh, Merle. [Rolling dice] That is a 21 versus AC.
Travis: You have disadvantage because I’m a protection fighter.
Griffin: Awww!
[Audience cheers]
Merle: [in a silly, cheesy voice] Thank you, Magnus.
Griffin: That’s a 17 versus AC.
Travis: No.
Clint: No.
Travis: Let me speak for Dad! No.
Griffin: The angel dance crew all vogue in the exact same way as Edward did and then launches towards you trying to grab you and pull you back into the moshpit. Uh, but magnus uses his shield [audibly smiling] somehow to stop that from happening.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Next in the order is Lydia, who… [thinking sound] Lydia casts Blight on... Magnus. Uh, it sounds a lot worse in this. Make a constitution saving throw, my friend.
Travis: That’s one of my good ones. That’s a 16 plus 9, a 25.
Griffin: Jesus Christ!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Okay, well—
Travis: Don’t go against a fighter in strength or constitution.
Griffin: Yeah, sure. On a failure that would have been 38 necrotic damage but because you saved it’s only 19.
Travis: Sick.
Justin: Nice!
Griffin: And you feel your, quote: “moisture and vitality drain”! [Audience laughs] DnD is nasty!
[Audience laughs and cheers]
Griffin: Uh, next in the order is Reggie. Uh, Reggie stands up from behind the bar and he jumps over it in one smooth party motion, uh—
[Travis and the audience laugh]
Griffin: He looks— he looks pissed off.
Travis: It’s just a good line, “smooth party motion”!
Griffin: He looks pissed off, and he stomps his foot. And as he does a hole in the ground opens up and a hose pops out and it just starts spraying foam everywhere [Audience cheers] into this battle that’s happening in the middle of the floor. And noth— [he pauses] Nothing else really happens.
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: But he’s trying to get this shit going with a sick foam party. [Audience cheers] Next in the order is Magnus.
Travis: Cool. Now do I remember you saying that the twins were in robot bodies?
Griffin: [Audience cheers] Wh—What? No.
Travis: You said they were robot DJ’s like daft punk.
Griffin: They had masks on to conceal their identities so I could take them off at some point and surprise the audience, they didn’t turn into friendly [crosstalk] robots—
Clint: [crosstalk] [???: Shh.] Now, Griffin, you know what he was wanting to do.
Griffin: [in a high pitched voice] I know what he was wanting but what if, [crosstalk] what—
Travis: [crosstalk] Then I’m going to say that Magnus is going to take advantage of the foam.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And slide on his shield like a, like a wrecking ball.
Griffin: Okay.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Okay. I don’t know what that looks like.
Travis: I’m going to like do a sick knee-slide.
Griffin: And smash— just smash, you’re just bowling? [Travis: Yeah!] Bowling for twins?
Travis: Bowling for angels! [Audience cheers]
Griffin: Okay, cool. Oh, you’re going for the angels, okay.
Travis: 17, plus I assume 7 which is my—
Griffin: Sure sure sure, I like it.
Travis: Yeah 25.
Griffin: A 17 would have hit on its own. Uh yeah, why don’t you roll… [high pitched thinking noise] Why don’t you just roll your, your regular weapon damage twice.
[Travis and audience “Oooooh”s]
Griffin: You’re gonna kill some angels. You feel big, big man?
[Audience laughs]
Travis: So, uh, that would be 25 total.
Griffin: Okay! Yeah, that’s a good, solid hit. You smash into the angels, and I think Merle and Taako who are still just like fucking grinding it out, you see just angels go flying up in the air like cartoon bowling pins. Uh, are you taking another action or are—?
Travis: Yeah, I am.
Griffin: Okay. [quietly] Figured.
Travis: Am I at the twins now or—
Griffin: Yeah, you’re up on— (???)
Travis: I attack… which one turned me into a mannequin?
Griffin: [smacks his lips] Edward, I guess.
Travis: Edward, right?
Griffin: Yeah yeah. [Audience cheers]
Travis: I attack Edward with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Griffin: Oh-oh.
Justin : [as if shocked] Oh nooooo.
[Audience cheers]
Travis: 7 plus 10, 17?
Griffin: Ahh... yes, that’s a hit.
Travis: Um, and it’s [Clint coughs] all, let me see, all of it? Is the damage I do, I believe, all of it?
Griffin: All damage, ever.
Travis: 9, so that’s 12 uh... plus 5, 17 damage. Oh no, sorry—
Griffin: I was about to say [high pitched] what the fuck is it broken?
Travis: It’s twenty— 36 damage, thank you very much.
Griffin: Yeah, okay. [laughs] He says,
Edward: Did you have that last time?
Magnus: I didn’t, but I do now. Fuck you.
Edward: Okay.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: He turns, he turns back towards Lydia, he’s like,
Edward: Are you 100% certain—
She says,
Lydia: We’ve got this! We’ve got this! This time for sure! He’s got a huge sword this time but we’ve got [at the same time] each other.
Clint:[at the same time] Each other.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And I— [laughs] I don’t think we’ve ever run into it before but I’m pretty sure it does ongoing damage, usually I just kill people in one sway but I think the poisoning part of it goes on.
Griffin: He says,
Edward: I feel like, wicked poisoned, are you 100—
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: Next in the order is Taako.
Justin: Okay. I’m gonna try, uh. I’m gonna cast a spell on the moshpit.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Uh, and the spell that I am going to cast is Silence.
[Griffin and audience “Oooooh”s]
Justin:I’m gonna create a sphere of silence centered on the, uh, centered on the sphere.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Bad news: Immune to Thunder damage.
Griffin: [Amused] ‘Kay. [Audience laughs]
Justin: But they are deafened while inside it.
Griffin: Yeah. Okay, how big is this sphere?
Justin: This is a 20 foot radius sphere.
Griffin: Okay, that’s definitely big enough to capture like the dance pit, as it is. And as you do that, you just see, like uh, you know a mosquito getting sprayed by mosquito spray, all the angels just sort of fall to the ground just sort of like, clutching their ears and looking around very confused.
Taako: Hey gang, Don’t forget to hydrate!
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Griffin: And the angel dance crew has been neutralized. I think one of them steps out of this sphere just to like leave and they go like demon again. And one of their friends like grabs them and pulls them back into this sphere like,
[He does something, most likely making a face and Justin and the audience laugh]
Travis: Once again, another good audio cue.
[Griffin chuckles and audience laughs]
Griffin: Uh, next in the order is Merle, the dance crew has been neutralized, uh, and yeah.
Clint: [laughing] My uh, believe it or not, my facial recognition thing won’t recognize me on my phone.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: Is it, is it a clothing recognition thing?
[crosstalk]
Travis: It’s like, I’m not giving this to you, Clint, take off the fucking hat.
[Audience laughs]
Clint: If Merle had his Extreme Teen Bible and it wasn’t zooming across the United States, somewhere [Griffin: Yeah.] in the United States’ postal system, he opens up his Extreme Teen Bible and casts Banishment on Leana. [Audience cheers]
Griffin: Leana is not [Travis: What? Who?] a person, stop, stop. Leana is not a person present in the room.
Travis: It’s not a person who’s present, ever.
Clint: Lydia. [Audience laughs] Cast Banishment on Lydia and attempts to send her to the Western Place that was caught in the time loop—
Griffin: Alright, sure, why the fuck not.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: What’s that look like? What am I doing?
Justin: That’s a, that’s a Charisma saving throw for that.
Clint: Yeah.
Travis: [sarcastic] It’s not like they’re gonna be charismatic at all, these vogueing twins. [Justin laughs]
Griffin: Uh, I got a 22 save on that.
Travis: That saves.
Griffin: Is that enough to save?
Clint: Allow me to speak for myself on my turn! [Audience cheers]
Griffin: Did it save, Mac?
Clint: Yeah.
[Griffin and audience laugh]
Clint: [laughing] It saved.
Griffin: You see her actually— what you get out of her is like the uh, Back to the Future Part 1 where like her hands starts to turn invisible and she’s like,
Lydia: Oh shit maybe we should—
But then it like pops back into place [Clint: Dammit] and she’s like,
Lydia: Okay nevermind.
Griffin: Uh, next in the order is Edward and Lydia. Uh, I think Lydia is pissed off about what you just tried to do to her. And she grabs the IPod and presses like a button on it and the music changes and as it does, Pan turns in your direction and his eyes [Audience makes shocked noises] have gone blood red and his face is cracked and... Uh, I need everyone to make a Dexterity saving [with a deep voice] throoow.
Justin: Aw dunk. [Audience laughs] Gonna get fucked up by Pan. [Griffin laughs]
Travis:Yep. That’s a 9 for old Magnus.
Justin: Yeah t‘cha boy got a 9 as well.
Griffin: Merle?
Clint: [away from the mic] Read it.
Travis: That’s a nat 20 for Merle.
Griffin: Aw yeah. [Audience cheers]
Travis: Merle does 18 unnecessary flips.
Griffin: Yeah, I think that, that—
Clint: Lemme, let me do a [???]
Griffin: Uh.
Clint: [with a deep voice] Well. Naturally, it’s a 20. [Audience cheers]
Griffin: That’s not—
Clint: [high pitched, faint scream] Ahhhhhh.
Griffin: That’s something, I guess. Uh, p— What I lo— Merle, like knowing Pan, like you see his face and instantly know something’s wrong and that’s why you have these cat-like reflexes as you flip backwards, avoiding a wall of thorns, uh that, Taako and Magnus aren’t, [chuckling] now Taako is in the wall of thorns still [Justin: Dancing, lovin’ it!] still fucking bumping it!
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: Uh, Magnus and Taako, take 30 piercing damage.
Justin: Daaang.
Travis: Alright. I’m bloodied?
Griffin: You all fall backwards as you are pierced by the thorns and now you are all trapped inside of a dome of razor-sharp thorns that Pan has conjured up trapping you inside [Audience laughs] Um. As you all take that damage, the thorns start sort of wrapping around themselves constricting tighter and tighter and tighter around you. Uh... next you hear Reggie and he yells,
Reggie: Oh no! [Audience laughs]
Griffin: Magnus, it’s your turn.
[Audience laughs]
Travis: I’m going to flex so hard, the wall of thorns breaks.
[Audience cheers]
Griffin: This is— Okay. You’re gonna flex so hard, stop. Talk about the science of why this works and I’ll let you—
Travis: You said they were constricting.
Griffin: They're not—
[Travis makes a noise like someone flexing]
Griffin: So you wait until they’re wrapped—
[Travis makes the growling and flexing noise harder]
Griffin: Yeah yeah, I heard it. I heard it. I heard it for sure. The problem wasn’t me not—
Travis: That’s a one!
[laughter, clapping, Audience cheers]
Griffin: Jesus. Uh, Magnus, you take 24 points [Travis: Yeah!] of piercing damage as you [Travis: Magnus is almost dead!] you walk up—
Justin: (???) that out in your canon, motherfuckers!
[laughter]
Griffin: [still laughing] Next in the order is Taako.
Justin: Again?
Griffin: Yeah bud, [Audience laughs] we’re moving fast.
Justin: Dang, we’re just cranking, huh?
Griffin: Yeah. I mean it doesn’t—
Travis: Hey guys, if you want to help out, I gotta open a school for dogs or whatever the fuck [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] It doesn’t take much time for Magnus to walk up to a wall of thorns, flex and be devoured.
[Audience laughs]
Justin: Alright, well let’s, let’s recap again.
Griffin: You’re trapped in a dome of thorns that is getting smaller and smaller, Magnus walked into the thorns again to flex and try and [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Okay, now I did misunderstand, I thought I was already in the thorns.
Griffin: Yeah. Uh, Taako. [Audience laughs]
Justin: [beat] Uhh.
Clint: And Merle’s fine.
Justin: And Merle is fine.
Griffin: You’re also in the dome of thorns so you are not hit by it.
Justin: Against all odds.
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Um. I can’t move, can I?
Griffin: You’re still da— oh you didn’t roll to save I think at the end of your last turn.
Justin: Oh yeah, yeah.
Griffin: Roll that uh, [Justin: Ohhh, roll that beautiful bean footage.] wisdom saving throw.
Justin: That’s a 18!
Griffin: That’s good! [Audience cheers] You stopped dancing.
Justin: I am, uh, I will pull out the… hole-thrower!
Griffin: Okay. [Audience cheers]
Justin: And use it on this sphere of thorns, now look at my two ??? sellers. “Get the hell out of here!”
Griffin: Roll a uh, a 1d10 I think to determine the... uh, size of this hole that you’re punching in the thorns.
Justin: Ooh boy.
Griffin: Do you need a 10-sided dice?
Justin: No, I got one.
Griffin: Okay.
[Rolling dice]
Griffin: Oh man, oh man, oh man!
Travis: How, wait. How thick is the wall?
Griffin: Huh?
Travis: How thick is the wall? And it’s a trick question.
Justin: [crosstalk] No, its cir— its circumference.
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s not a thi— it’s not a thickness question, it’s a circumference question. How big are we talking here, bud?
Justin: [defeated] One foot.
[audience laughing and cheering]
Griffin: I’ll give you this, I’ll give you this: it’s big enough for one of you guys to get through, and Merle, it’s your turn.
Clint: Aw, man. Merle casts Flame Strike on the thorn wall.
Griffin: While you’re all inside of it??
Travis: Remember when I said I’m almost dead and we have like a whole canon about how I die?
Griffin: Just so we follow the scene: Taako punches a hole in the wall big enough for Merle to get through, Merle says “ah, good! I’m gonna blow us all up with holy fire!”
Clint: All right, Merle casts Mass Heal. [crosstalk] A flood of healing energy—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay, just so I’m clear: Taako punches a hole in the side of the thorns, and you say “Ah, good! I’m just gonna heal us while the thorns continue to circle in!”
Travis: Yes!
Griffin: Okay, do it!
Clint: Yes, exactly. You restore up to 700 points! Look at that shit!
Travis: Yup!
Justin: What’s he casting?
Clint: Mass Heal.
Justin: That’s a 9th level spell, my man. Do not have it. Do not have it, let’s try again.
Travis: Dammit!
Clint: You just sat there waiting for me to commit to that.
Travis: What about Healing Word?
Griffin: What about kind-of Mass Heal?
Clint: Oh, I don’t need your—
Travis: Medium Heal!
Clint: I don’t need your pity! How about, uh… Okay, Regenerate!
Justin: [crosstalk] Okaaaaaay?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay?
Clint: Where you touch a creature and stimulate its— why is the font so small? Its natural healing ability!
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: Okay. Who are you doing this to?
Clint: To M— to— Beefy O’Burly over here!
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Beefy O’Burly?
Travis: Please, sir, that’s my father!
Justin: That’s 4d8 plus 15.
Griffin: Cool. Uh, next in the order is Edward and Lydia again. Here’s what happens: the vines start closing in closer and closer around you, and just as they are about to envelop you, the room just kind of disappears. All of the vines just vanish, and you are standing in this black void. Reggie’s gone, all the angels standing in the dome of silence are just gone, it’s just you standing in this black void. And then a shape appears, a blue triangular wedge. And then adjacent to it, two more wedges, one green, one yellow. Then more and more appear, all different colors, all branded with these different symbols—
Travis: It’s the Triforce.
Griffin: All forming the Wheel of Sacrifice, and that’s when you realise you’re back in Wonderland.
Justin: Fuck!
Griffin: And you all actually recognise each other’s outfits as the clothes you were wearing while you were in Wonderland. Taako is heavily wounded from when that piece of heavy machinery fell on him some time ago—
Travis: Who’s clapping for that??
Justin: One person clapping, I saw that!
Travis: You monster!
Justin: Monstrous!
Griffin: A catwalk rises up from the floor, and Edward and Lydia step down it, and Lydia says,
Lydia: Oh, brother, do you think it’s time that we told them?
Griffin: And Edward says,
Edward: I guess the act is up! I imagine it must be quite shocking to return to our stylish little torture complex. Funny thing is...you never actually left.
[crowd yelling]
Justin: [groaning] Oh, god.
Griffin: And Lydia says,
Lydia: We warned you there was no escape! Everything you’ve experienced since “leaving” has been but a waking dream we’ve implanted in your minds. We’ve just been draining you of your suffering the entire time.
Travis: I attack ‘em.
Griffin: It is your turn.
Magnus: No, here’s the thing.
Griffin: Okay.
Magnus: The last time we fought you, you took my body.
Edward: Yup.
Magnus: And you pissed us off.
Edward: Yeah?
Magnus: And if I remember correctly, my sister from another mister fuckin’ ate you up.
Edward: Yeah.
[crowd cheers]
Magnus: We’re not there.
Edward: Kay.
Magnus: Fuck right off.
Griffin: Okay!
Travis: And I attack with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: And that’s a 22 versus AC.
Griffin: Okay. You— Taako and Merle, you see Magnus wield this massive god-killing weapon and you see him jump forward and then suddenly you see him encased within the wall of vines, which reappear all around you as the Hallucinatory Terrain disappears. Magnus, you take 30 points of piercing damage as you’re consumed by the vines again.
Travis: Then I’m attacking the vines! That was a solid—
Justin: [crosstalk] No, no, no.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, there’s no way you saw it. Edward says,
Edward: You fucking yokle! Got you again, you dumb dumb!
Travis: Okay, wait, how much do I lose?
Griffin: 30 points of piercing damage.
Travis: Okay. And then I attack again.
Griffin: Okay. This time actually looking at the vines?
Travis: No, shooting through the hole with the cross— no, with the Chance Lance.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: That’s a 19.
Griffin: Okay, who are you throwing that at?
Travis: You know what, I’m going at Edward again. Fuck that dude.
Griffin: Okay. Yeah, that’s a hit.
Travis: That’s 12.
Griffin: Okay, that’s cute. No, it’s sweet, it’s a sweet...it’s a sweet hit.
Travis: And I do it again.
Griffin: [half exasperated] Okay.
Travis: Uh, no, this time I’m going to attack the vines with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: That’s a nat 20.
Griffin: Oh shit, okay.
Justin: You really got those vines!
Griffin: No need to roll damage on that one, my friend, I think with that— you describe it. What’s it look like? How are you attacking them?
Travis: I think one solid slice and it just split— the whole dome just goes “wreeeeeee pfffft” [high pitched creaking sound, followed by the sound of something collapsing] and splits open.
Griffin: Okay, yeah. The vines fall away. As they do, you all see Pan standing in front of you, and he looks real bad. His face is—
Travis: And I’m going to use my Second Wind—
Griffin: His face— his face is all craggy and messed up, he has these blood red eyes and he roars as he sees you. And then actually it’s Reggie’s turn, if you’ll allow it. He— you all hear this loud boom, and then see Pan just disappear in this burst of confetti and you look over and Reggie is holding a confetti cannon that he’s just fired in Pan’s direction. And the concussive force of that has knocked— rendered your deity unconscious, and on the ground. [Justin laughing] Uh, next in the order is Taako. Taako? And at this point now, I think Edward and Lydia realise their bag of tricks has been nearly emptied out, and they look a little nervous.
Justin: I am going to— I’m going to cast Circle of Death. [Griffin laughing] ‘Cause when nothing else will do, you cast a Circle of Death. That’s a sphere of negative energy radiating out of a 60 foot radius. You gotta make a constitution saving throw.
Griffin: Yeah, all right.
Clint: That’s a level 9 spell.
Justin: No, it’s level 6, Mac. Good try.
Griffin: I rolled a 3 for Edward, plus whatever, it’s not going to get me there. And then I rolled a 6, plus 4 is a 10? Still probably no. [Justin: No.] So what happens?
Justin: That’s gonna be 8d6 necrotic damage.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Hold on— man. Ok, here we go. 3. 1. You all add it up.
Travis: Four.
Justin: 1.
Travis and Crowd: 5.
Justin: 5.
Travis and Crowd: 10.
Justin: 6.
Travis and Crowd: 16.
Justin: 4.
Travis and Crowd: 20.
Justin: 6.
Travis and Crowd: 26.
Justin: 6.
Travis and Crowd: 32.
Justin: Is that 8?
[muffled shouting from the crowd]
Travis: One more!
Justin: One more?
Travis: One to grow on.
Justin: 6!
Travis and Crowd: 38!
Clint: [imitating the Count from Sesame Streer] 38! 38 hit points!
Taako: I— can I say, I’m going to be so stoked to tell my sister she did not kill you...and I did.
Griffin: Edward says,
Edward: We’ll see about that! We practically invented necrotic—
Griffin: And then he just explodes in a puff of black smoke. And then—
Travis: And Magnus catches the iPod and realises it’s just full of U2.
Griffin: It’s just full of free U2, he didn’t even pay for it.
Magnus: There’s so much U2 on here! This is all— U2, U2, it’s just all U2!
Griffin: And Lydia— Lydia—
Travis: That’s the real curse!
Griffin: Lydia looks over at her brother, who is now a puff of smoke, and just says,
Lydia: Looks like Team Wonderland is blasting off agaaaaaaiiiiiiiin!
Griffin: And she explodes too. And instantly the music just disappears. You see Pan start rubbing his head and regaining his senses. The cone of silence disappears. You hear one of the angel dance crew just yell,
Angel Dancer: No more phat beats, please!
Magnus: Only juicy beats!
Angel Dancer: Juicy’s Calm Beats! Some calm house music to do homework to!
Magnus: Play some— just some Enya, please!
Angel Dancer: [crosstalk] Please!
Clint, Travis and Justin: [singing] Sail away, sail away, sail away….
Griffin: Jump cut to Istus’s cottage. You see half a pantheon’s worth of deities now sheepishly exiting the place, dark circles under their eyes, carrying their belongings over their shoulders. Pan is one such deity after returning with you. As he stops and prepares to leave, he turns towards you, Merle, and he says,
Pan: If you don’t want to follow me anymore after what you saw today, I will—
Travis: “I’m sorry about all of those things I DMed you.” [crosstalk] That’s a ‘Deity Message.’
Pan: [crosstalk] I would totally— I would totally, totally understand.
Merle: No, listen, it’s all about forgiveness, buddy. You did okay.
Pan: Which one of us is the loving god, right??
Merle: Exactly!
Travis: Wait, at what point did he do okay? He attacked us!
Clint: Look, you have your gods, and I’ve got mine!
Griffin: The rhythm took him over, Travis! The three of you also see Reggie. He’s got a push broom and he’s trying to use it to clean up all of the trash scattered across Istus’s yard, and he’s failing because that’s not the right tool to use for that job, but he’s giving it some effort and when he sees the three of you he approaches humbly and he says,
Reggie: So, uh, listen, listen. I goofed. I goofed it. I goofed up bad, look. The whole divine charge thing? It’s all about getting the party going, but today, I— I did over-party, and I did not think that was possible. [sobs]
Taako: Does this make me the new god of partying? Because you’re cleaning up—
[audience cheers]
Magnus: I’m happy to just be, like, the undergod of partying.
Taako: Yeah, or— is there something more specific than partying, now that I think about it? Like, if I could be the god of organising my sock drawer—
Magnus: Yeeaahh!
Griffin: He says,
Reggie: I owe you big time. I promise, from now on, I’m gonna keep things real conservative around here. Just three foam parties a week, sandwiched between nightly turbo raids, but I’m gonna cut those off at 5am so folks can get a nice morning sleep before heading out for the aforementioned foam party.
Taako: I want a—
Clint: Griffin, you have the longest arms.
Taako: I want—
Travis: Yeah! Look at this fuckin’ wingspan!
Clint: You’re like an orangutan!
Taako: I want a boon.
Reggie: Okay?
Taako: I want a boon where if I’m throwing a party and I yawn, everyone leaves instantly. Can we do that? Can you grant me this one wish, this one party wish?
Griffin: He says,
Reggie: I’ll do you one better.
Taako: There’s literally nothing better than what I just described.
Reggie: If you’re at a party where you don’t know anybody, but there’s a cat, you’ll be able to talk to the cat using Language.
Taako: I love this, yes!
Travis: And at that point, Merle and Magnus and Taako just fall into each other’s arms, crying, cause they’re so fucking happy.
Griffin: And with a snap of his fingers, the three of you are transported back to the prime material plane. You’re just standing in a field outside of Neverwinter, and from there you see the world setting itself right. The sun shoots back up into the sky, the trees are all bending to stand up straight—
Travis: Can we get dramatic lights, please?
Justin: No lights, just let him read!
Griffin: A dramatic light I would accept. I don’t know if we have access to those. But in the distance—
Justin: It’s one slider, just “Dramatic.” Bring it up!
Travis: Oh no, I hit Whimsical!
Griffin: But in the di— [sings] In the distance… We see an object plummet from the sky.
Magnus: Oh, look, look, look.
Griffin: A golden trail of light following behind it. It crashes to the ground somewhere in the Felicity Wilds and then we see it close up, and a small smoking crater, Pandora’s Boombox sits submerged in the soft loam of the forest floor. But not for long. A gloved hand reaches down and removes it from the crater, and as this figure holds their new treasure aloft, we see an ominous grin flash across the face of Garfield the Deals Warlock.
[audience screams and cheers]
Justin: Shit!
Griffin: And then I wrote, “The End???” That’s it everybody, thank you so much for coming out!
Justin: Thanks y’all! Thank you, thank you!

Announcer: What’s up San Diego? It’s me, the weird voice. Since we’re at Comic Con I feel like I can finally say, I’ve been Batman the whole time. Swear to me! It’s the Adventure Zone!
[THEME MUSIC: ""Déjà Vu"" by Mort Garson]
[Audience cheering wildly]
Justin: That’s like three minutes of show you don’t get. Oh wait! Magic potion. [noise like cup hitting table] Umm.
Griffin: Jesus, I’ve got a timer. We— are so fucking bad at timing out this show and we always have to like, spoiler alert: the last ten minutes are gonna be like “uhh and then the boss shows up and you kill him he’s dead!” I got a timer here and it’s actually I just realized the most stressful imaginable object. Hi everybody, welcome to The Adventure Zone! Thank you for coming!
Travis: Uh, I would like to go ahead and get it out of the way, can we get house lights for like just a minute [crosstalk] to see all the awesome cosplays?
Griffin: [crosstalk] I wanna see all the cosplays! If you’re cos— Jesus, god. Oh man, alright.
Travis: Keep cheering.
Griffin: Uh, yeah.
Clint: Wait a minute, I’m gonna sketch you all! Hold on.
Justin: It’s awesome. And you can just leave a check for a portion of the rights to those…unlicensed…
Griffin: Uh, let’s play Dungeons and Dragons. I wanna really spend some time playing this one and not [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, let’s actually play Dungeons and Dragons.
Griffin: Real quick introductions I’m Griffin McElroy and I’m gonna be the Dungeon Master. [cheering] Thank you thank you thank you.
Travis: Wait, hold on. Is there anyone here who doesn’t know the show, ‘cause it’s about to get real weird for you.
Justin: Uh, my name is Justin McElroy, I’m Taako Taaco, a wizard. [cheering]
Travis: I play Magnus Burnsides, the rustically hospitable fighter. [cheering]
Clint: And I play Merle Highchurch, the incredibly...uh...talented and gifted Dungeons and Dragons player. [cheering]
Travis: Don’t get too close.
Clint: Was I too close?
Travis: My dad, who’s been a radio professional for the last 120 years, and—
Griffin: And he eats that microphone like it is a doughnut!
Clint: Whaat? There’re doughnuts?
Griffin: Let’s, get into it. Uh, I need everybody [chuckling] to make a Dexterity saving throw.
Clint: [very quietly] Shit.
Justin: These dice...
Clint: [Ecstatic laughter]
Justin: [crosstalk] Whoa, he did it! Nat 20, nat 20!
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: We were, we were audio testing and Dad was showing his fancy dice off ‘cause when you roll a 20 it flashes and makes noise and Dad said, “I’ve literally never seen that happen before”.
Clint: So I won!
Justin: Uh, 11.
Travis: Um, I rolled...fourteen plus two, sixteen.
Griffin: Okay. Uh, Taako, you fall twenty feet and splash into a gigantic pool of acid.
Justin: It happens!
Griffin: And as you hit the acid and take damage, you see what looks like two glowing, like holographic hearts float up and away from your body and disappear. And floating in this pool are the bones and nearly eroded-away armaments of long-lost adventurers who met with a similar fate to the one you’re about to succumb to.
Uh, “the smooth walls of this pit are lined with a spiral of two-inch-wide holes which you cannot see into. Far far above this pit in the ceiling of the room you just fell from is a circular trapdoor the exact circumference of this pit, uh and from behind that trapdoor you can hear rumbling”. Magnus and Merle, from atop this pit you see your friend fall inside and land in acid, what do you do?
Clint: Right—
Magnus: Are you okaay?
Taako: What the fuck does it look like?
Magnus: I think you fell!
Taako: Good, oh, that’s good, you’re on the right track!
Magnus: Do you want us to get you out of the hole?
Taako: No! I have magical powers.
Griffin: [laughing] As— as Taako says that, he dissolves completely and disappears.
Travis: Well, and that ends Taako. You were all here for it.
Justin: Should be a chill night, for the J-man.
Griffin: Uh, you do see all of his great stuff and some treasure floating down in the pool…
Travis: I use the grappling hook to save the treasure and stuff.
Griffin: Um, make a, I don’t know, a grappling hook roll. Uh, roll a D20.
Travis: Uh, 15.
Griffin: Okay. You bend over to fish out some of the, uh, some of the, uh, treasure...
Travis: That is not what I said!
Griffin: Merle what are you doing during this?
Clint: Uh, I’m…I’ll heal him. [Audience cheering and laughing]
Griffin: Alright. This is good.
Justin: Now, I did— now, okay.
Griffin: Uh, Merle, you lean over the pit to try to cast a spell to heal your… dissooolved?...friend…
Travis: It’s gonna have to be one hell of a roll!
Justin: It’s gonna be a good heal, man!
Griffin: As the two of you are leaning over this pit, the trapdoor above you opens, and drops a deluge of acid on the two of you as well, dissolving both of you also instantly. And as you’re killed, your body fractures into a million tiny multicolored squares which hover and gather where you died and then soar up into the air and out of the room you’re in, and through a twisting corridor, much fast— uh, much too fast for you to try and get your bearings.
And then, all three of you are back and standing in a long stone-wrought hallway. Behind you, the hallway extends thirty feet and at that end you see, like, a slope of dirt and sandstone bricks leading upward and out of sight and there’s some sunlight shining down from that, uh, that rough staircase.
And in the other direction away from that entrance, it— the hallway extends and it’s far too dark for you to see anything.
And after surveying this scene, the three of you notice an image in the upper-left corner of your periphery, and as you turn your head, the image moves with you. Like, it’s in a static position, and it depicts a small—
Clint: Can you do that again? Yeah.
Griffin: It depicts a small, armor-clad hero, and then a time symbol, and then the number eight. And as you’re reformed in this hallway that counter drops down to five. And you hear the disembodied voice of Lucas Miller, the scientist [audience applause] the scientist you saved one fateful Candlenights, say:
Lucas: Uh, okay, so…that didn’t go so great. I may need to tune down the difficulty settings a little later on—
Magnus: Yes! Don’t make it difficult, that’s not our thing at all!
Justin: What’s the backstory of why we fuckin’ agreed to do this? Cause right now, [crosstalk] that stairway’s looking pretty good to Taako.
Griffin: Hey, wait— [crosstalk] Justin? Character voices. [raucous audience applause]
Justin: That wasn’t— no.
Clint: [crosstalk] Yeah!
Justin: [crosstalk] No, no, no!
Clint: Character voices!!!
Travis: [crosstalk] That was OOC.
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay. No. Before you cheer for this dullard, I— when have you ever heard someone in your real life say ‘What’s the backstory’? I was talking to, fucking talking to Griffin.
Griffin: Ask, ask, ask Lucas Miller what’s up.
Justin: Um, what?
Griffin: I’m not gonna tell you what’s up, but Lucas Miller will. [crosstalk] Uh, character voices.
Justin: But we know where we— okay, do we— is this—
Griffin: [crosstalk] You don’t remember what’s up.
Justin: Is this in media res or in media non-res?
Griffin: We’re in media res, dude. [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay, media res—
Griffin: [crosstalk] We are in the media and it is res.
Taako: Hey, Lucas, Lucas—
Clint: Theatre degree.
Taako: Lucas, my man, remind me why we’re here?
Griffin: Lucas says:
Lucas: Wait, you...you seriously don’t remember? I—
Justin: Fuck off with that, seriously. [audience laughter]
Lucas: I wonder if the brain spike is having some sort of effect on your short-term memory—
Magnus: Are we in the fucking Matrix?
Lucas: You’re in a virtual reality program that I designed to help train members of the Bureau of Balance.
Magnus: Matrix.
Lucas: It’s Matrix-esque. Really, what it’s modelled after is an old dungeon in an old fantasy game I used to play…it’s called the Tomb of Horrors.
[audience applause]
Travis: [crosstalk] Y’all NERDS!
Clint: [crosstalk] You were waitin’ for it!
Justin: Aaawwh, geek check! Got you.
Lucas: Y’all were making pretty good progress. The goal is to reach the end of the tomb and destroy the evil demilich Acererak, and claim his treasure for your own. Y’all started out with ten lives, but it looks like you burned through half of them. You’ll need to be much more careful if you want to clear this dungeon.
Griffin: And then in the bottom right corner of your vision some words start appearing, and then a chat message from a user named ‘BoyDetective15’— [audience screams]
Travis: Different guy.
Griffin: It’s a, yeah, it’s a different, it’s uh— no, it’s Angus McDonald. It says:
BoyDetective15: Please be careful, sirs! [awws from crowd]
Griffin: And then another message from ‘killerkillian’ pops up— [audience screams]
Travis: Okay, we’ll be here all night!
Clint: Is that all the show’s gonna be, just droppin’ cameos like that?
Griffin: Yeah, I guess so. That’s fun, that’s a fun— hey: Kravitz! [audience cheers] [Griffin makes pschh mind blow noise]
Clint: Hey, good idea.
Griffin: All right. A message from killerkillian pops up that says:
killer Killian: someone better turn on easy mode
Magnus: Hey, shut up!
Griffin: And then another message from a user just named ‘Leon’ just says:
Leon: lol [pronounced loh-wel]
Griffin: And you hear Lucas again, and he says:
Lucas: Just keep moving forward, and watch each other’s backs. Your real bodies are totally safe in my lab, I— I promise.
Taako: Yeah, I believe that.
Justin: Um, so what’s the exit? What do we have here?
Griffin: Well, I’ll tell you, using mostly descriptions from “The Tomb of Horrors”: “You reach the end of the hallway, away from the entrance, and are standing before three features of interest. The first is an archway. [with increasing drama] The stone archway before you is filled with a veil of thick vapours.”
Justin: Hell yeah.
Travis: Someone’s been vaping!
Justin: [crosstalk] Someone’s been vaping.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Someone’s been vaping thick cotton!
Justin: Gary Gygax invented vaping. Tweet it!
Griffin: “The stones on either side of the base and the keystone protrude slightly from the stones around them. As you move to within touching distance, the left-hand base stone begins to glow yellow, the right-hand base stone orange, and the keystone seven feet above blue.”
Travis: Wait, what?
Clint: Should we be writing this down?
Griffin: “The second feature worth noting is directly in front of you, at the far end of the hall. On the hall before you is a relief sculpture of a great green devil face, formed of mosaic tiles. The face has a h uge O of a mouth—”its o-face, if you will— “inside of which the space is dead black.
“The most outstanding feature in this location is actually outstanding”— wait, what? Oh, no, it’s like outstanding from the wall, okay. “Two jackal-headed human figures are painted so as to appear to be holding a real bronze chest that protrudes from the wall.”
Uh, that’s it. So you have the chest being held by two jackal-headed human figures, the great green devil face with the O-mouth that is filled with—
Travis: How big is his O-mouth?
Griffin: Um, it’s three feet in diameter.
Travis: I throw Chance Lance into it.
Griffin: Okay. Uh. It goes in.
Magnus: We did it!
Travis: And then I call it back.
Griffin: You do what?
Travis: I call it back?
Griffin: Oh. [laughing] No, you don’t.
Magnus: Don’t put your hand into the O-face.
Griffin: Yeah, your lance is... gone.
Travis: It’s not real. I mean—
Griffin: It’s real to me, damn it!
Justin: Okay, I take several steps back from the chest, and I cast Knock on it.
Griffin: What does that do?
Justin: It, uh, opens it. I could read you a fucking card if you want, but it opens it.
Travis: I also want to say, as he’s doing this, I am continually trying to call back Chance Lance.
Griffin: All right, so Merle, what are you doing while Taako casts Knock?
Clint: Um, I guess I will investigate the two—
Travis: [warningly] Donnn’t.
Clint: Uh—
Travis: You’ll die. Whatever you’re about to do, you’ll die. You’re gonna make a joke [Griffin laughing], and Griffin’s gonna smile in his shitty way that he does, and then he’s going to kill you. We gotta play this one straight, Clint.
Clint: All right. [writing it down] Don’t… examine… protruding… chest.
Travis: Correct.
Griffin: The chest opens.
Justin: Hell yeah! [Travis and Clint sing the Final Fantasy victory theme]
Justin: I, uh, I look— Mm—
Travis: Mm—
Justin: From where I am, a good distance away, I kinda… echolocate what might be in the chest. [Griffin cackles, Travis makes bat noises]
Griffin: What’s that sound like?
Justin: [high pitched boop mimicking submarine sonar]
Griffin: Using that method, it appears to be empty.
Travis: You’re not gonna make him roll for that?
Justin: [crosstalk] For echolocation?
Travis: [crosstalk] You’re just gonna let him echolocate?
Griffin: Yeah, Taako canonically has bat powers now. It— it— it appears? To be empty.
Travis: That’s the shitty way I was talking about.
Justin: Okay, well then there’s nothing, the chest is nothing. Everyone, the chest is empty and nothing, so let’s move on to something else.
Griffin: [high-pitched] Eeeemmhhhmmm…
Magnus: Lucas, this sucks.
Griffin: You hear Lucas go:
Lucas: [high-pitched] Eeeeeehhhhhhhhmmmmmmhhhhmmmm…..
Magnus: Ohhh—
Clint: Merle casts Find Traps.
Griffin: Okay. [beat] Your fuckin’ brain explodes. You just hear a million voices scream like ‘YES!’ [pause] You hear a voice scream “IT’S THE TOMB OF HORRORS! THERE’S A MILLION OF THEM!”
Clint: Well, I can reuse this, can’t I?
Griffin: I guess so? The answer’s not going to change.
Travis: You know what, fuck it, I stick my hand in the chest.
Justin: That’s—
Travis: Wouldn’t Magnus do that? [audience assents] Thank you. I also agree.
Griffin: The lid of the chest slams down on your hand and you feel sharp poisonous needles jab into the top of your hand—
Travis: I immediately chop off my arm. [cheers]
Clint: No no no no no no! Huh-uh, huh-uh, huh-uh—
Travis: I’ve trained for this moment!
Clint: No, no, no, if anybody gets to do it, it’s me.
Travis: You’re too slow, old man!
Clint: No—
Justin: [crosstalk] Let Daddy—
Travis: I’ve done it already! Do I need to roll an attack against myself?
Griffin: Yeah, roll an attack against your own arm what are you doing?
Travis: Not great. Well, here’s the good news— well, bad news is, I rolled a five—
Justin: Hey. Wait, quick time-out. What’s worse: a good attack on yourself or a bad attack on yourself?
Griffin: A good, a good— listen, this is a surgery roll. You want high numbers right now.
Travis: Well— oh, okay, well, I rolled uh…five, plus a ten is a fifteen— but I don’t get out of the way of my own attack. I choose not to defend.
Justin: Wait, how on earth— how on earth do you add ten?
Travis: That’s my attack.
Griffin: He’s very good at attacking. [crosstalk] Okay—
Justin: [crosstalk] Wow.
Travis: You can— you can shoot flames from your hands and levitate! I just hit stuff good! Please!
Justin: Nah, it’s fine, it’s fine.
Griffin: Uh, Magnus, you take damage, and as you do you see something new appear in the upper right corner of your periphery. Three hearts pop into view, and as you cut off your own arm? Uh, two of them disappear, leaving heart-shaped outlines in their place.
Magnus: I’m gonna need some cauterizing magic, guys.
Justin: Nope.
Griffin: Uh, actually, you seem to be fine. I mean [beat] fine-ish.
Travis: I’m all right.
Griffin: Yeah, you’re all right. [audience boos at the pun] Oh, all right, all right. Uh, after the chest—
Travis: Wait. Let it.
Justin: Yeah, it’s a real thinker.
Clint: They’re done, they’re done.
Griffin: After slamming down on your hand that way, the chest lid lifts open and the trap is disarmed. Oh! [pun-based laughter]
Travis: I spend the whole rest of this period just looking at Merle going ‘ehh? eh??’.
Clint: So now there’s an arm in it.
Griffin: Yes. And… maybe other stuff.
Travis: No, don’t reach in there!
Griffin: No, actually, the arm also turned into pixels and floated away. Yeah, it’s beautiful.
Travis: I’ll see you again at the crossroads! I stole that joke from Justin earlier.
Griffin: What do you do?
Justin: It’s just a Bone reference, it’s not really a joke.
Griffin: Yeah, it’s not really anything.
Travis: That’s fair. I go home.
Justin: Can you guys angle your mics? I’m just worried about plosives. That’s not a joke.
Griffin: That’s bad, that’s the opposite of doing it—
Justin: [crosstalk] No, not like that. Look how Daddy’s doing it, look how Daddy Justin’s doing it. Not Daddy Daddy— Papa Justin. No, look, [high-pitched] fucking look! There we go. Yeah. Mic at the mouth, not mouth at the mic, we gotta— how’s this been, this past thirty seconds, pretty good? [Griffin cackles, audience cheers]
Justin: Normally, this is the stuff we edit out, but you’re not gonna leave, so I just have to say it in front of you.
Travis: If everybody could just plug their ears for a second while Justin coaches me through good audio recording?
Justin: Hey Dad, if you want to get crazy and do the same thing I just made Travis do, go for it.
Clint: I have been in the radio business for forty-five years—
Griffin: Okay, the chest— the chest trap is disarmed. You have the devil’s mouth and the mist door.
Justin: Does the Chance Lance break, or is it just stuck in there?
{00:18:11}
Griffin: As it enters into that inky blackness, It’s not like throwing it down a hole where you can see it drop a little bit and then disappear, as soon as it goes— [crosstalk] like crosses,
Justin: [crosstalk] It’s just nothing?
Griffin: It’s just nothingness.
Justin: Ok.
Griffin: Uh, yeah. Chest trap’s disarmed. Mist door, devil mouth.
Magnus: Well I took the last one, so uh...
Justin: Is there any exit from this room?
Griffin: I mean the entrance where you came in.
Justin: Well that’s [inaudible]
Travis: And the mist door…
Justin: And the mist door.
Griffin: And the mist door, yeah.
Justin: So what’s the— tell me about the mist door.
Griffin: Well, I’ll tell you all about the mist door, Justin. “The stone archway before you is filled with a veil of thick vapors” [crosstalk] The stones—
Justin: [crosstalk] Hell yeah.
Griffin: Uh, the left stone of the door is glowing yellow. Uh, the right one is orange and the top one is blue.
Justin: Left yellow, top—
Griffin: Top blue. Right orange. [yelling] This is such a shitty puzzle! I don’t know why they put this in the game!
Justin: Ok, I don’t want to get technical, but you put it in the game this time.
Griffin: S’true. [Audience laughter]
Clint: And to get even more technical, you plagiarized it from something else.
Griffin: That is also true.
Justin: Ok, so… all- do the, do the tiles have any give if I push them? Are they buttons?
Griffin: Yes, they click in and they make a pleasant chime. What did you push in?
Justin: Uh… [Audience laughter]
Justin: Nothing, I just asked a question [crosstalk] if they do that.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ok well there’s no way you can discern that information without doing it. So I— forget what I just said. [crosstalk] Eternal Sunshine.
Travis: [crosstalk] You did, ten minutes ago, let him echolocate. So you’re drawing a fairly fine line now!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, that’s true.
Justin: Uh, I’m going to cast “True Seeing.”
Griffin: Ok.
Justin: This gives me the ability to see things as they actually are. Which in this case is the solution to the puzzle. [Audience laughter] I just wanna see what it actually is.
Griffin: Um. You can tell because you can see through the facade of this door the order that these buttons are supposed to be pressed are yellow, blue, and orange.
Justin: [taking notes] Yellow, Blue, Orange. Ok I do that.
Griffin: Ok, yeah. The mists disappear.
Justin: [sings Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare] Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-dun-duh-duh! Thank you magic powers!
Griffin: You hear— You hear Lucas say,
Lucas: I am sorry about that one— This is not a good puzzle.
Travis: How were you supposed to figure that out? What was the— [crosstalk] Ok.
Lucas: [crosstalk] Yeah exactly, I think it was just a guessing game. Um. It was made in the 70’s and people were doing a lot of peyote back then. Um—
[Audience laughter]
Travis: So when— when, uh... [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] We were. [Griffin and audience laughs]
Justin: He says as he drinks his Diet Coke from a Tervis tumbler.
Clint: It’s a Doctor Who Tervis tumbler!
Travis: Ah, that’s way better.
Clint: Doctor Who on BBC America
Justin: [crosstalk] Fuckin- fuckin’ Moon Dog. Just keep rollin’!
Griffin: Uh, after you clear the archway of mist and start passing through it, another pe— message pops up in the chat from username Bluntlord420. Uh, who says:
Bluntlord420: niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice.
Griffin: And then another message from Bluntlord420 who says:
Bluntlord420: This is Robbie btw.
Travis: Yeah. [Audience cheering]
Griffin: You movin’ on?
Justin: Yeah we’ll go through that door.
Griffin: Ok, yeah you uh all go through that door and the three of you work your way through a claustrophobic corridor and enter a small dark room. And as you do, you hear the entrance you just passed through shut behind you. And as you turn around, you notice that the entrance has disappeared completely.
Immediately, torches mounted on the wall spark to life revealing the contents of this chamber. Three large chests are affixed firmly to the floor. The western one is gold plate covering Iron. I don’t know why they included that, like you’re just gonna fuckin’ steal the chest and be like “Nice try!”. Uuuuh. I’ve got a chest of gold now. Uh, this center one is silver plate over iron and the eastern one is of, uh, is oak bound with uh bronze. It’s oak bound with thick bronze bands. Each is—
Travis: Is this your first time reading this?
Griffin: Yes. Each is about four feet long, two feet wide, and three feet high. And as you enter this room a username Dragonzord, who is Carey, chats and says uh— she chats and says:
Dragonzord: OOOOOF I remember this one, good luck!
Magnus: Then tell me the answer!
Taako: Yeah, what’s the answer?
Griffin: There’s no response.
Travis: Damnit!
Justin: Classic.
Travis: Wait! I know this one! I know this one.
Griffin: Gold, silver, and oak chests. What do you do?
Travis: The oak is the chest of a carpenter! [Audience applause]
Justin: Yeah. I, I crawl on my knees to that one, the penitent man shall pass. Penitent uh… man shall pass. Fuckin’ Last Crusade? Are we not doing Last Crusade?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, no we’re doing Last Crusade.
Travis: [crosstalk] Is that not the joke that we’re doing?
Justin: What’s the fuckin’ sh— cuz I’m better at Last Crusade than you all? I get punished by not laughing at me? Seems kinda shitty.
Travis: Wait, try it again. Take two. [crosstalk] We’ll edit that.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah. yeah-yeah-yeah. Penitent man shall pass, right? [Travis, Justin, Clint, and audience give hearty fake laughter.]
Clint: Wait a minute. Do that Police Squad freeze frame.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Um….ok, well I did— cool.
Taako: I did cool things for the last one.
Magnus: I lost my arm on the last one!
Taako: Fair.
Taako & Magnus: Merle?
[Audience laughter]
Clint: I’ve been saving this spell since we started playing this game three and a half years ago.
Travis: Translation, he didn’t know he had it.
Griffin: You literally just found it in your deck.
Clint: I cast Hero’s Feast! [Audience laughter]
Travis: [crosstalk] And we all sit down to a nice dinner before we go on!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Do you remember— no no no. Do you remember the conversation where we had, literally right backstage, we were like “Let’s just keep a nice pace movin’, just chew through the adventure.” and you’re like “a b— bountiful bouquet of meats and breads!”
Clint: You bring forth a great feast including magnificent food and drink. It takes an hour to consume. [Audience applause]
Justin: Why?
Travis: And we’re gonna do it in real time!
Justin: Why?
Travis: Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!
Justin: Why?
Clint: The creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits!
Justin: Speed—
Travis: Health insurance! Dental!
Clint: It makes all wisdom saving throws with advantage and hit points of all creatures maximum increases by 2d-freakin’-10! [audience cheers]
Justin: Stop. Stop. Stop. You’re embarrassing yourselves. Stop it. One, we don’t have hit points, that was nothing. To start with, there’s no hit points, remember, just the hearts.
Clint: Oh. Shit.
Justin: So that’s nothing. That part was nothing. And I guess wisdom sa— I mean
Travis: This is a delicious sandwich— my arm’s back!
Justin: Can we translate that hitpoint game to hearts? For him?
Griffin: Yeah, all of you have on extra heart. You’re up to four. I’ll give you that. And you have advantage on wisdom saving throws. Maybe, uh, the chests would be cool to—
Travis: Wait, we’re not done eating.
Justin: Everyone sit in silence.
Clint: You know, the whole “keep the pace movin’” thing you asked us about.
Travis: Ok. Gold, silver—
Griffin: [exasperated yelling] OPEN A FUCKING CHEST! OPEN ONE!
Travis: You know what, I’m already injured, so I, I’ll do it. I open the oak chest.
Griffin: You just—
Travis: Nope!
Justin: Wait. [Laughter]
Griffin: When the lid of the oak chest is opened, a large humanoid creature with the head and wings of a bat. Or, if you will, a bat-man. Uh, will be instantly teleported into the room and it strikes with surprise. Magnus!
Travis: [with trepidation] Yes?
Griffin: Uh, does 22 hit your AC?
Travis: [pause] …Little bit.
Griffin: Yeah…
Travis: …Little bit it does.
Griffin: The bat-man swipes a jagged claw through Magnus and as he does, [crosstalk] Mag— uh.
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m gonna use Parry.
Justin: He chose [crosstalk]… poorly.
Travis: [crosstalk] They could use… [audience laughter]
Justin: That’s another ‘Last Crusade’ for you guys.
Travis: Um
Griffin: There is, there is— Parry just reduces damage. It’s not gonna [crosstalk]— You only—
Travis: [crosstalk] Yes. And I use… crying.
Griffin: Yeah. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: This bat-man rakes a claw through Magnus and as he does Magnus explodes into pixels.
Magnus: See y’all later!
Griffin: And you see that counter in the corner turn to the number four.
Travis: Shit.
Griffin: Uh, Magnus very quickly though, you appear back at— where the entrance to this room was.
Magnus: I’m back!
Griffin: Uh, I’m not gonna make you all roll initiative because we’ll do that for a different thing, but uhhh what do you do about this bat-man who’s now in the room.
Magnus: Round two, bat-man!
Griffin: After one of you does something, the bat-man will also do something.
Justin: Uh, I’ll cast fireball at the bat to kill it.
Griffin: Ok. Uh, does that—
Travis: Wait! Maybe he’s friendly— wait, no he did just kill me.
Justin: Yeah, he just killed you.
Griffin: Yeah, no you could talk to it [crosstalk] Maybe you just—
Clint: [crosstalk] The bat that eviscerated you might be our friend.
Travis: [crosstalk] Bat-man!
Griffin: The bat-man says [beast noises] [laughter]
Griffin: And then he points to buffet and he says:
Batman: [garbled] Is this for anyone or can I get down on it?
Magnus: Yeah, no— Wait. Hold on. Which chest do we open and then you can have some turkey.
Batman: I got— I was protecting the chest!
Magnus: Sugar water!
Batman: Best Sugar— Put it in a snapple, son I wanna eat those!
Clint: [crosstalk] God, I hope nobody just walked in.
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m sorry, what?... Which chest?
Batman: No, I wanna eat the apples and bananas first!
Magnus: You can have an apple, but you can have a banana after you tell me. Apple’s first.
Travis: This is the best thing I’ve ever done with my life.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Talk to my brother, as a bat-man, about bananas.
Griffin: By the way, I’m gonna be the new Batman after Ben Affleck leaves, and it’s gonna be this voice. [Audience cheers]
Batman: What’s the [unintelligible]
Clint: It was a little—
Justin: It would still be better than Christian Bale.
Griffin: Uh, what—
Justin: Is he here tonight? I’m sorry—
Griffin: Probably not. [Audience laughter]
Griffin: [crosstalk] uh, what—
Clint: [crosstalk] We’re fans, Chris.
Justin: I cast a Fireball at your dumb bat.
Griffin: Ok, I make a dexterity saving throw.
Justin: Sure.
Griffin: You have the card, right? I rolled a three, so there’s nothing I’m gonna add to that that’s gonna be sufficient.
Justin: Uh. Sorry what?
Griffin: I fucked uuup?
Justin: Ok. [Audience Laughter]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Hurt the bat with fire now.
Justin: [crosstalk] So, you’re gonna 8d6.
Griffin: Jesus Christ. Just roll one and times eight! We’re on rain pace.
Justin: Do what?
Griffin: Just roll 1d8, or whatever, d6 and we’ll multiply it by 8.
Travis: [softly] that’s a 6
Justin: That’s a 6, ok.
Griffin: Jesus Christ. [Audience cheers]
Taako: Magic!
Justin: 48.
Griffin: No, I can fuckin multiply six times eight. Uh, the bat sees the fireball coming at it and just nervously reaches over and grabs an apple and [monster noises] and then explodes as the fireball hits it for 48 fucking points of damage.
Justin: Good.
Griffin: Uh, you killed bat-man.
Justin: I solved your bat puzzle.
Griffin: [laughs] yeah you killed bat-man. [Audience cheers]
Griffin: Inside the oak chest is nothing.
Travis: I get inside of the oak chest. I close it…[pause] No I don’t! That’s a joke.
Griffin: No, no. nothing happens. There’s nothing.
Travis: I get back out of the oak chest.
Griffin: Yeah, you’re embarrassed now.
Travis: I— but I do have fun like “Yeah!” when I come out.
Griffin: Silver chest and gold chest. What do you do?
Clint: Uuuuuhm.
Justin: Open one [crosstalk] coward.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Literally, It’s 50-50.
Merle: I open the silver chest!
Justin: So, you’re saying that— wait, stop.
Clint: That was in a character voice!
Justin: Stop, stop.
Travis: So wait, hold on.
Justin: So wait, hold on. Hol— ok, so.
Travis: You, Merle, are looking at Taako and going, “I open—”
Justin: You say, out loud, to me, “I open the silver chest.”
Clint: Alright, I open the silver chest.
Justin: Alright, I look at you and say
Taako: Oh-kay, you dooo? Go on.
Travis: And for a second, Magnus and Taako just look very concerned at Merle, like “Oh it’s happening.”
Justin: So concerned. Your twilight years have come. Sooner than we expected, it’s so sad. But hey, we had a good run. Ok, so—
Travis: We put him in an old dwarf’s home.
Griffin: Inside the silver chest is a clear crystal box worth 1000 gold pieces that holds a silver scepter.
Travis: There was a man-bat in mine!
Griffin: [Unsympathetic] Yeah.
Justin: Uh— I, I take the scepter—
Clint: Wait a minute. No no no no. uh uh
Justin: You did something, It’s my turn to do something.
Griffin: The scepter’s in the— the crystal box has the scepter in it and it’s inside the chest. You just get the whole thing out—
Travis: Y’all, this is Tomb of Horrors, it’s not just like, “Here’s an awesome scepter.”
Justin: Yeah, I pick it up and I smash it on the ground.
Griffin: Uh, when the box is lifted from the supposed bottom of the chest, eight darts will fire upward and the one or two characters leaning over the chest, so as to be exposed in the line of fire, will take, uh, hurts. Hurting damage. Uh, you take three hearts worth of damage. It’s good that Merle boosted you up like that, as a bevy, a salvo of darts are flung into your face and chest.
Justin: Happens.
Travis: I open…the other chest that’s still closed.
Griffin: Oh, great!
Travis: Wait, [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Wait, did I get the scepter?
Griffin: Uh, did you— what did you do with the crystal chest after you lifted it out and got hit by a bunch of darts? Taako.
Justin: I, well… I smashed it on the ground is what I said.
Griffin: Ok, it’s no longer worth 1000 gold pieces, but you get the silver scepter from out of the chest and as you smash it and claim the scepter, a wooden, arched doorway suddenly appears in a puff of smoke at the end of the room.
Travis: I stop just before opening the other chest.
Magnus: Aaaaaall right. Fair enough.
Griffin: Uh, you move through that doorway?
Travis: Yes!
Justin: Sure.
Clint: Yes!
Griffin: As you pass through that doorway the three of you are moving down another long hallway lined with torches.
Travis: [crosstalk] Is it nice?
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh good.
Griffin:Uh, I mean it’s the fucking Tomb of Horrors, [crosstalk] man. There’s nothing that’s super nice in here.
Travis: [Crosstalk] But like, but like is it nice?
Griffin: Yeah, it’s a nice horror tomb...
Travis: I’m saying, there can be traps and there can be danger, but that doesn’t mean there can’t be nice tapestries.
Griffin: Well, it’s weird that you say that, Travis. Uh, as you’re moving down this— [crosstalk] Torch-lined hallway,
Travis:[crosstalk] Is it?
Clint: [crosstalk] Apparently not!
Griffin: Uh, you start to see something odd. The flam on the torches freeze suddenly in place and the cobblestones that comprise the walls and the floor— they start to flicker almost like they’re glitching out.
Magnus: You all see this too, right?
Taako: Yup.
Griffin: Uh, they do, yeah.
Magnus: I just thought that it was kicking in, you know?
Griffin: And after—
Magnus: I took a bunch of ecstasy before starting.
Travis: Not me, Magnus did. [crosstalk] Magnus did.
Griffin:[crosstalk] Magnus did. Magnus is a certified party boy and that’s all there is to it.
Travis: Well, he’s been spending a lot of time at Joshua Tree, just really getting centered.
Griffin: With ecstasy?
Travis: Yeah, it’s fucked up!
Griffin: I feel really centered right now! [mimes waving glowsticks] [laughter]
Griffin: These were glow sticks— y’all saw the glow sticks in my— ok. Uh, this entire place is glitching out around you, and after a few seconds, the hallway disappears completely and you’re standing in just an empty black void and you hear Lucas’ voice only it’s super distorted and he’s saying
Lucas: Wait, what’s going on? I— I’m losing them. What’s happening to the simulation?
Clint: What happened to the distortion?
Griffin: Well I… wanted them to hear me. Get off my jock. Um, suddenly the three of you are standing on a small fishing boat.
Travis: Aw, nice.
Griffin: In the middle of a large lake. And you’re— you’re outside and it’s a beautiful sunny day.
Travis: Finally my dad’s taking me fishing!
Griffin: And as you get your bearings on this boat, some words appear in front of all of you in these bright block letters. And they read: Big Bass Challenge!
Travis: Yay! [Audience cheers]
Griffin: And as those words appear, some bright, poppy music starts playing. And uh, in the back of the boat there’s a bearded man in a big floppy hat on the boat with you and he’s drinking drinking something out of a big jug and he says:
Rascal: Welcome to Big Bass Challenge! Welcome to Big Bass Challenge, I’m Rascal! Y’all ready to catch some Big Bass?
Magnus: Am I ever?!
Taako: Always!
[pause]
Magnus: I like Big Bass and I cannot lie!
[Audience cheers]
Justin: I’m all about that bass. [Audience cheers]
Clint: I love fishin’. [Audience laughter]
Justin: Got ‘em.
Clint: I don’t— I didn’t get the other two references.
Griffin: He says:
Rascal: I don’t know where you strange travelers hail from—
Travis: I kill Rascal. [laughter]
Clint: Yeah…yeah pretty much.
Travis: I just wanna take away any joy Griffin has.
Justin: Travis punches him in the head and he’s full of piñata candy. Nobody saw this coming.
Griffin: [sounding dejected] Go ahead and roll…
Travis: He said we had to keep a fast pace!
Griffin: [pouting] ...go ahead and roll a d20...
Justin: Wait, why are you?— this is so outta—
Travis: It’s a 16 plus 9! Sorry, plus 10. 26.
Justin: [crosstalk] Wait, this is very out of character, I don’t believe that you would kill Rascal. That doesn’t make sense to me.
Clint: Yeah.
Justin: I feel like that’s the—
Travis: [sarcastically] Thanks, Reddit! [Griffin cackles, audience cheers]
Justin: [laughing] Oh, shit.
Griffin: You, uh— what do you attack him with? Railsplitter?
Travis: No, I just kinda, whooa—
Griffin: No, you fuckin’ attack Rascal—
Travis: I punch him. I punch him with Phantom Fist. [crosstalk] And I just push him out of the boat.
Griffin: [crosstalk] You punch him with Phantom Fist and—
Travis: I’m just pushing him out of the boat.
Griffin: He flies backwards off the boat, and he says:
Rascal: R— [Griffin tries miming being hit, breaks down laughing]
Clint: ...What does he say, Griffin?
Justin: Yeah, what’s he say? Tell me what he says!
Griffin: H— he says— [more laughing]
Rascal: Time for Rascal to fly to Jesus!
Griffin: And a— a big— a big, big bass jumps out of the water and eats him in midair. [audience applause] And now, Rascal’s dead.
Justin: Cosplay that!
Griffin: As Rascal is killed, a fishing rod and tackle box appear where he was sitting; it’s the loot he dropped. And as those items appear, some words appear on your, like, interface, that read ‘Catch a Big Bass to Proceed!’
Justin: Hey— speaking of Reddit, I think no one can really accuse Griffin of railroading us anymore, since we just killed his whole thing. We killed his guy. All right. Um, I’m going to—
Travis: I’m going to use Animal Handling.
Clint: To order fish to jump onto your hook?
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, I’m gonna do the Ernie[?]. No, let Justin do what he’s gonna do if that’s an actual thing that might help the story.
Justin: Do I see the big basses in there?
Griffin: You can see several, like, shadows under the water, and one of them is quite large. And it is the one who just killed…my favourite person.
Travis: I appreciate you for acknowledging I didn’t kill Rascal, the bass did.
Justin: Okay. Well, uh, I’m gonna center on the place where I see that fish, and all of his other fish friends, and I’m gonna cast Reverse Gravity. [audience laughter]
Griffin: I will need the description on that one if you’ve got it.
Justin: It reverses gravity in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot high cylinder, centred on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a dexterity saving throw to grab on to a fixed object it can reach. Good luck, it’s a lake. If some solid object such as a ceiling is encountered, bla bla bla, there’s no ceiling… um… it will remain oscillating there for the duration at the top.
Griffin: Okay. A cylinder of water levitates out of the lake, several feet in front of the… stern of the boat? Which side’s the front?
Clint: Uh, the left. [at least 5 separate audience members yell ‘Bow’]
Travis: Bow.
Griffin: The bow.
Clint: The bow. Yeah.
Griffin: I get them confused. Okay, the fucking front of the boat.
Travis: [crosstalk] Thank you.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I don’t know why I had to get nautical on it—
Clint: The sternum is the other side.
Griffin: A fifty-foot cylinder of water raises up out of the water, and inside that you can see several small shapes still floating around, but one of them is clearly the Big Bass. That killed my best friend, Rascal.
Travis: Wracked with guilt, uh—
Justin: All right, Taako lays back in the boat and says:
Taako: There, do somethin’ with that!
Travis: Wracked with guilt, I am going, um—
Griffin: Rascal was very evil. I’ll just say it now. He had a whole turn at the end where it turned out, like… this is also the finale of the Adventure Zone, and he was gonna be the big bad guy at the end of it…
Clint: [disappointed] Awww.
Travis: With my rapier,
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I am going to leap at the fish and swim over to it.
Griffin: Okay?
Travis: And I am going to cut it open and save Rascal. [audience cheers]
Griffin: [exasperated yelling] You can’t just say shit!
Travis: You let Justin echolocate! Let me save Rascal! This’ll be good for both of us.
Justin: You can see how that would give Travis an unclear view of his abilities. You did let me echolocate.
Griffin: Uh, okay, you jump into this fifty-foot column of water. Can Magnus—
Travis: And I also do want to point out, this is not OOC. Everything I just said to you Magnus did say out loud.
Magnus: I’m gonna jump at the fish, I’m gonna swim in the water, I’m gonna cut it open, I’m gonna save that guy I just killed!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah. Roll— roll Athletics? To, like, represent your ability to jump into a column of water and swim to locate a fish. Like, if it’s low, I think you can’t even open your eyes super-good underwater.
Travis: It’s a 13 total.
Griffin: Uh, all right, yeah, I think you can kinda get a bead on where this fish is, but you’re gonna have disadvantage on an attack.
Travis: That’s fine.
Griffin: —‘cause you’re fucking underwater trying to cut it open with a rapier— none of that is intended, like none of that’s how any of that’s supposed to—
Travis: I’m gonna attack it.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: It’s a 16, plus 10, 26.
Griffin: And that disadvantage?
Travis: Oh, that’s a 3, plus 10. And then, uh, I am going to, uh…
Justin: Usually you say Action Surge.
Griffin: If the end of this sentence isn’t ‘be devoured by a large bass,’ then you’re lying to everybody here.
Travis: I’m gonna use Precision Strike.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: To add to an attack roll.
Griffin: All right.
Travis: Um, that’s a d8…
Griffin: A d8? Fuck.
Travis: Nope, sorry, d10. ‘Scuse me.
Griffin: Jesus, no, that’s worse.
Travis: That’s an 8.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Plus, uh, so 21 was the final roll.
Griffin: Okay, uh, yeah, roll damage. That’s a hit on a fish. [applause] That’s a fish hit. As Magnus stabs his rapier through this fish, all of you see the words “FISH ON!” appear on your screen. And the music changes, all of a sudden it’s like, really poppy and upbeat now.
Travis: I cut the fish open.
Griffin: You c— roll damage! You don’t just cut a fuckin’ fish open! [audience laughter] ‘I stabbed a dragon with a stick and it explodes!’
Travis: It’s... it’s 7. Aw man, I should’ve used the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Griffin: [laughing] Yeah, but you didn’t. All right, you—
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh wait, I don’t have that yet canonically.
Griffin: You hurt the fish, and as you stab the fish, you see one heart float up and away from it and disappear.
Travis: I stab it again, I get a second attack.
Griffin: Alright. Still disadvantage.
Travis: That’s a 17.
Griffin: He really does roll like this.
Travis: That’s— a 9. 9 plus 10, 19
Griffin: Yep. That’s a hit. Roll damage again.
Clint: Cut it open
Travis: 2 plus 4. 6.
Griffin: Ok another heart floats up and away from this fish. It looks pretty bad off.
Travis: Ok. I’m gonna use my third attack.
Griffin: Well, let’s— [Audience laughter]
Travis: It’s a 19. [rolls dice again] That’s a 1. [Audience laughter]
Clint: Travis McElroy has rolled a 1.
Justin: You were here. Can you imagine? You were in the room: the room where it happened. [Audience cheers]
Travis: Wait, wait, wait. I think I have something for this.
Griffin: Ok, is it.
Clint: Somebody take a picture of this.
Griffin: You don’t. [crosstalk] You are—
Clint: [crosstalk] Good.
Travis:I thought that— isn’t that what the Gambler’s Luck does?
Griffin: Not today friend.
Travis: Ok.
Griffin: The fish, you stab it and it goes like “euuuwhuh” and you stab it again and it’s like “hoohoowlhuh” And then you try to stab it a third time but your rapier kind of bends off its scales and the fish goes, [smugly] “b-h-hooolwlhuh”
Justin: Oh he likes that doesn’t he?
Griffin: Yeah, he likes that. He’s a dirty fuckin’ fish.
Justin: [crosstalk] Nasty. Nasty fish.
Griffin: Uh, It turns and swallows you whole. Make a constit— No it’s not one of those things! [Audience cheers at vore]
Griffin: Bunch’a... my fucking dad is here! He’s here and on stage! Don’t expose him to this! Make a constitution saving throw.
Clint: Only his fuckin’ dad can make jokes like that!
Travis: Uh, It’s an eleven total but I’m going to use— This I do have, Indomitable, [crosstalk] to roll that again.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ok. Yeah roll it again.
Clint: Can Justin and I play?
Travis: That’s a 4!
Griffin: Ok yeah, you take—
Travis: [interrupting Griffin with high pitched noise] 4 plus 8, it’s a 12.
Griffin: You take two hearts of damage, how are you doin’?
Travis: Doin’ ok!
Griffin: ok.
Travis: I just died, so—
Griffin: And inside, you fuckin’ like— You’re being eaten by a bass and it’s horrible and uh—
Travis: Do I see Rascal?
Griffin: You fuckin’ eventually just see, like, Rascal like poking out of its side and it’s been half sort of like added to the form of the fish, Akira-style. And it’s— and he says:
Rascal: Welcome to the jungle!
Griffin: As you are— Taako and Merle. What do you do? Fish in a floating cylinder of water, [crosstalk] somewhat hurt. You’re in a boat.
Justin: [crosstalk] I— I feel— honestly I feel pretty good right now. I’m kicking it. I made the column fly, that was great.
Griffin: Merle then.
Clint: I cast Banishment.
Travis: I’m in it! You asshole!
Griffin: Ok.
Justin: He’s in the fish.
Clint: Remember? Remember this? [waves wooden arm]
Travis: I saved your damn life.
Griffin: Ok, uh…
Clint: You have to— the fish has to make [crosstalk] A charisma saving throw, and—
Griffin: [crosstalk] A wisdom saving throw?... Charisma? I didn’t give the fish a fucking charisma stat, Clint!
Clint: A fish has fins, so it can’t make a throw.
Griffin: That’s a critical failure, that’s an actual 1. [Audience cheering]
Griffin: Uh— [laughs]
Taako: If you wanted it banished, I coulda banished it!
Clint: I sent it to another plane of existence.
Griffin: Yeah I know what you fuckin’ do to it. Magnus you feel yourself being whisked away to another dimension, I guess? And you see this fish, like also disappearing and you see fucking Rascal inside the fish-guts wall just like:
Rascal: I’m free!
Griffin: Uh, and you are all disappeared, and as you disappear the lives counter drops down to three and then the Tool Tip pops up again [crosstalk] and it says, “Catch a big bass to proceed.”
Justin: [Crosstalk] Wait, not necess—
Griffin: And then that Tool Tip, because you fuckin’ like…
Justin: No wait, I got—
Griffin: —Bethesda-broken the fucking game, [Audience laughter] starts to glitch out.
Justin: Where does— Where does Banishment send them?
Clint: Um… I guess I get to choose the plane of existence.
Griffin: I think in this situation, because you’re in a virtual reality simulation, the game doesn’t know how to reconcile this and so the entire environment around you just kinda like glitches out because you fucked up the game and broke it so badly.
Clint: So I won?
Griffin: …You’re back in that sort of black space again and Magnus reforms next to you and then all of a sudden there’s—
Travis: Seems familiar.
Griffin: You all are back in that hallway that you were just walking through that froze up. [close to the mic, defeated] I didn’t expect it to go like that… [Audience laughter]
Travis: What did you expect to happen?
Griffin: You to catch a FUCKING FISH IN THE FISH MINIGAME! [Audience cheering] IS THAT SO— AM I OUT OF MY MIND? IS THAT AN UNREASONABLE EXPECTATION? To give them a fucking fishing minigame. Taako makes the f— the lake float, Travis jumps in with a rapier like “Let’s get it done!”, and then dad makes the fuckin’ shit teleport away!
Clint: Welcome… Welcome to the Adventure Zone, Griffin! [Audience cheering, Justin giggles with glee]
Griffin: As you come back, the chat, people are just spamming in it, and they’re just saying ‘fish boiiiiiiiiiiis!!!!!’, and, uh, Lucas says
Lucas: Big Bass Challenge? God, I haven’t played that game in years…
Travis: Wait, hold on, are we streaming this on Twitch?
Griffin: He says
Lucas: How did you— how did you end up there? That doesn’t make... any sense? I think... I think there might be something wrong with the simulation. I’m gonna pull you out.
Griffin: And then there’s a pause, and then the three of you feel something... unpleasant. Not here, in the virtual world. You don’t take any damage or anything like that, but you feel your bodies experiencing pain; almost like you’re experiencing a powerful electric shot— uh, shock, rather.
[giggly] I’ve drank almost this whole bottle of wine tonight. And then, uh, as you experience this shock, the chat updates again, and this time it’s with a message from the demi-lich Acererak, who says
Acererak: [in Griffin’s natural voice] Not today, friend.
Travis: Does he say it in [high pitched] that voice?
Griffin: Uh, it’s chat, so it doesn’t say it in any voice. [clears throat] And then as, uh, this lich comments in the thread, the chat is flooded with messages from everyone, all saying in unison:
Everyone: ...wtf?
Travis: Lol!
Griffin: And I think right there we’re gonna take an intermission real quick so we can all run to the bathroom and so you all can run to the bathroom! We’ll be right back in 10 minutes to finish! The adventure! [audience cheering] [Theme song plays]
{48:18} [ad break]
[Theme song plays]
[audience cheering]
Griffin: No, no, no, no! [more cheering]
Griffin: No, we don’t, we don’t get to do that twice. Uh, this is our first time taki— no, oh Justin’s filming I guess...
Justin: In case my children and grandchildren are watching this in the future, this is intermission. [crosstalk] They cheered way more, they cheered way more in the intro. The first time we came out, they went bananas. I didn’t film that, sweetie.
Travis: [crosstalk] Is that 4K???
Griffin: We’ve never—
Travis: Could you all say— [audience cheering]
Travis: Here— I, [crosstalk] here’s what I want everyone to say—
Justin: [crosstalk] It was just like that. [more cheering]
Justin: Ok. And then they— and then they, then they stopped so we could finish the show—
Travis: I’m gonna count down 3-2-1, and after I say 1, I want everyone in unison to say ‘Hi Charlie!’
Griffin: [crosstalk] Awwww.
Travis: [crosstalk] Are you ready?
Justin: Who’s Charlie?
Travis: Ok, you ready? Three! [singing] ‘and the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon’...Three! Two! One! [audience: “Hi Charlie!”]
Travis: Thank you.
Griffin: That was very good. We’ve never—
Travis: I would do it for my daughter, but she doesn’t care about y’all.
Griffin: We’ve never— [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Because she’s a jock!
Griffin: Oh please let me say this sentence. We’ve never taken an intermission before on this show, and, like, an hour before the show we were like, ‘what if we peed during an intermission?’ Instead of spending the last 30 minutes of the podcast like ‘go go go go go! Kill ‘em, kill ‘em, do it!’.
Clint: Then they killed a guy! Then they rolled some dice! The end! Thank you!
Travis: Ok bye!!
Griffin: Yeah yeah. During the Austin show all four of us had to pee so bad that Travis would miss on an attack and we’d be like “NOOO!” Okay, let’s get back into it. The three of you hear Lucas say,
Lucas: Okay, so, something bad is happening? For some reason I’m unable to pull you out of the simulation.
Magnus: Not like this.
Griffin: He says,
Lucas: Listen, very good. Very good and very... timely.
Griffin: He says,
Lucas: If you clear this dungeon, the simulation should just boot you out by default? So I think your best bet is to just keep pressing on and try to make some progress.
Travis: What I want right now is, to picture this, whatever the UI, whatever the HUD is, Magnus just slowly pointing at the life times 3, like,
Magnus: (high pitched questioning noise)...?
Griffin: He says,
Lucas: No, I know it’s not great, just, like— be better, I, do—?
Magnus: (repeated high pitch).......?
Griffin: He says,
Lucas: Just, like, do better I guess?
And then—
Magnus: Did you program any extra lives, any mushrooms?
Taako: Yeah, sure, any mushrooms we can find?
Griffin: Uh, he says—
Lucas: Actually, that’s a good idea, hold on, let me see what I can do—
Griffin: And then the (laughing) the words— fuckin’— “Game Genie detected!” appears and then the UI statics out and he’s like
Lucas: I tried to use the Game Genie, it didn’t work.
Travis: The Game Djinn!
Griffin: The what?
Travis: Game Djinn! It’s what— ‘Cause in D&D there’s djinns... [applause] No, it’s too late! You had your chance!
Justin: [to audience] You behaved appropriately.
Griffin: As he tries to use the Game Genie, killerkillian pops up in the chat and she’s like
Killian: lol casual
Clint: What the hell are you people talking about?
Travis: (shouting) It’s called video games, old man!
Justin: Yeah, get with the times!
Clint: In my day—
Justin: They’re not just Pac-Man anymore.
Travis: Actually I would like to hear about back in dad’s day. Can we take a brief—?
Clint: We didn’t “lol”. (laughter)
Griffin: The three of you enter into a long chamber, about 10 feet wide, and you’re standing on a landing. Oh, that’s fun! You’re standing on a landing over a 10-foot-deep pit—
Travis: Oh, you really got dad with that one. [Clint’s laughter/coughing] He’s just never seen you have fun before.
Griffin: Um, this bottle of wine was just in our green room.
Travis: (laughing) Not anymore!
Griffin: It’s empty— Um, the three of you enter into a long chamber— I did that part. The 10-foot-deep pit with a cobblestone floor— This pit stretches about 50 feet before ending with another landing about 10 feet up, on the far end of the room, and atop that landing you can see an exit to this chamber with torches on either side. Basically, you are standing in front of a 10 foot deep, 50 foot long pit with a cobblestone floor, and across the 50 foot span you can see a landing on the other side with an exit to this chamber, [singsong] what do youuu dooo?
Travis: I hand Taako the end of my rope, and I say
Magnus: Hold on to this.
Travis: And then I use my grappling hook to get to the landing.
Griffin: Ok. Ok, ok. Ok. You’re gonna throw your grappling hook 50 feet?
Travis: No, my grappling hook shoots [crosstalk], it doesn’t throw.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh that’s right, that’s right, I forgot you had some Darkwing Duck shit.
Travis: Yeahhh.
Griffin: Uh, yeah, fuck it, alright. Uh... make a ranged attack roll, roll a D20. Straight up, no bonuses.
Travis: [muted] I don’t think I have to, I think my grappling hook—
Griffin: [slightly exasperated] Yeah, but go ahead and roll a D20….
Travis: That’s a 8.
Griffin: [beat] Nooooooooo. [audience laughter]
Travis: Tha— wha— now hold on! That’s like having a sword that I have to roll to see if it stays a sword! The grappling hook just does it, what do you mean— [growls at Griffin]
Griffin: [slightly mocking] You— You tried it? And everyone heard you try it, and they’re very impressed with you trying it, but it didn’t wooork. [audience cheers]
Clint: Don’t patronize him.
Griffin: If it makes you feel any better, if you had succeeded I would’ve made, like, a fuckin’ lion appear and eat the rope or something.
Travis: [crosstalk] You’re a wiener!
Justin: [crosstalk] So, the pit is below us? Is that right?
Griffin: That’s how pits usually work, yeah. [Clint/audience laughter]
Justin: I thought we were in the pit alrea— Nevermind.
Griffin: No no no, it’s below you.
Travis: So, 50-foot wide.
Griffin: Yeah, 50-foot... long.
Travis: Landing on the other side.
Griffin: Yep.
Travis: Is there anything on the ceiling, anything hanging from the ceiling, any—
Griffin: No.
Clint: They’re just cobblestone?
Griffin: It’s not a fuckin’ Ninja Warrior, like—
Travis: So—
Griffin: Although, hold on— [chuckles] [taking notes] next… live… show… Ninja… Warrior… thoughts?
Travis: So… it’s just a big open—
Griffin: Yeah it’s just a 50-foot long pit. [slightly mocking] Boy, you boys are real spooked by the Tomb of Horrors, huh?!
Clint: [crosstalk] Ok, wait a minute, wait a minute—
Travis: [crosstalk] Wait wait wait. I know this one.
Clint: Oh?
Travis: It’s... Leap of Faith.
Griffin: [audibly smiling] Ok. [audience laughter]
Clint: Uh, we’ve already done one [crosstalk] Indiana Jones joke—
Travis: [crosstalk] Now—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Please! Please Christ please follow that— that thread!
Travis: No, we only have three lives left, I’m not doing that joke.
Griffin: [beat][softly] Please do the joke?
Travis: No!
Griffin: [slightly whiny] Traaaaviiiiissssss—
Clint: [crosstalk] Come on Travie, do the joke—
Travis: [crosstalk] Wha—
Griffin: [crosstalk][whinier] Traaaaviiiiiiiissssss—
Travis: [crosstalk] If I do it—
Clint: [chanting] Joke! Joke! Joke! Joke!
Travis: If I do it, will you give me the life back?
Griffin: Uh, I won’t kill you. [audience laughter, Travis giggles]
Travis: Alright, fuck it. I go running at the pit.
Griffin: Alright. You just jump right in?
Travis: [audibly shrugging] Yeah.
Griffin: Alright. Uh, rollllll… Acrobatics. Let’s see if you land on your feet.
Travis: I have a pretty good Acrobatics… [dice hits table] 18 plus... 8, 26, [crosstalk] no sorry— 18 plus 9, 27.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah you land— You land all cool at the bottom of the pit and it’s fine.
Magnus: Come on down! [pause] Pit’s great!
Justin: Ok I— I go down in the pit too.
Griffin: Alright, it’s cool.
Travis: Wait! Make him roll!
Griffin: Did you just climb down or what are you doing?
Travis: [crosstalk] No, I catch him, he’s fine.
Justin: [crosstalk] I— I, uh, expand the Umbrastaff and use Feather Fall.
Griffin: Yeah yeah yeah he Feather-Falls, that’s cool. [crosstalk] Merle?
Clint: [crosstalk] Ok— Merle jumps...so that Magnus will catch him.
Griffin: Uh...Magnus, roll...
Travis: A catching attack! [crosstalk] I choose you, Merle! [rolls dice] That’s a 16, I caught him!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah! Yeah, you caught him real good. Alright, uh, as, uh— [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Will you rock me back and forth?
Travis: [crosstalk] I used a Master Ball!
Griffin: Aw—
Clint: What?
Griffin: As you—
Clint: Wait, I have to know what he just said.
Travis: “I used a Master Ball” is a Pokémon [pronounced poké-MAN] reference.
Griffin: I’ve been trying to get you to fuckin’ play Pokémon my entire child, teen, and adult life.
Clint: That, and drink whiskey.
Griffin: Yeah. At the same time.
Travis: Those are two weird things to try to get your dad to do!
Griffin: Yeah. [crosstalk] Tell me about it.
Travis: [crosstalk] ‘I just wish my dad drank more!’
Griffin: As you step— As you catch Merle’s weight at the bottom of the pit, you hear a loud—
Travis: I don’t catch him.
Griffin: ‘Ka-chunk’— That’s not how this is— uh, you hear a loud ‘ka-chunk’ and you feel the floor of this pit drop down like, just a half-inch or so, but you all definitely feel the floor below you just, just [high-pitched] sooo slightly drop down. Nothing happens, but you feel it [very high-pitched] juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust [crosstalk] a little bit.
Travis: [crosstalk] I drop Merle.
Griffin: Ok, still fine.
Travis: [beat] I pick him up again. [audience laughter]
Travis: I drop him again!
Griffin: Still good, still great.
Travis: [to audience] This is science, people!
Griffin: Yeah. It’s super not how science and weight works, but ok. Uh, you are all on the cobblestone floor of this pit and you felt the floor drop below you. You have a 50-foot span forward. What do you do?
Justin: Uh, I cast… [various thinking noises, all laugh]
Clint: 50-foot [crosstalk] jump—
Travis: [crosstalk] Hero’s Feast!
Justin: How much did it— Yeah, right— Um, I’m just gonna start walking forward.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s fine.
Justin: Yeah I’m walking forward.
Griffin: Cool.
Travis: I’m going to start walking forward.
Griffin: You DIE! [audience laughter]
Travis: Noooo!
Griffin: [laughs] No, you’re fine. Yeah, you’re all fine, you all can walk to the end of this pit to where the landing is.
Travis: Hey Griffin, this is a real shitty trap. Um— [audience laughter because Griffin smiled]
Clint: [sarcastic] Oh, good. Thank you Travie.
Travis: I like to give ‘em a little somethin’, you know.
Clint: [sarcastic] Yeah.
Justin: Uh… I climb up to the landing.
Griffin: Ok, roll a, uh, Athletics check Taako.
Justin: That’s… [muttered] probably Dexterity.
Griffin: [beat] Probably Athletics, or Acrobatics if you wanna like, you know, acrobatically move [crosstalk] up, but use those two.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, use Acrobatics, that’s good.
Clint: Sweet Flips. [audience cheers]
Justin: No, I’m— No, that’s— You’re just— That’s pandering. A 3, 8, no I got nothing. That’s three rolls in a row that would’ve failed. [audience laughter]
Justin: I was gonna go with the first one, but I’m just saying it would’ve—
Griffin: Uh, all three of you—
Travis: Do you wanna try my loaded dice?
Griffin: All three of you make a Dexterity saving throw.
Justin: Son of a bitch.
Travis: Wait, what?
Griffin: Yeahhhh…
Justin: Now that’s a 16 for Hoops.
Travis: Ooooooh… mine is— Dex saving throw? 15.
Clint: [quietly] F— fourteen. Plus… [whispered] shit…
Travis: [away from mic] There, you’re there. Plus 1, plus 1. [back to mic] Plus 1.
Clint: Oh, plus one?
Griffin: For fif—
Travis: Fifteen.
Griffin: Ok, uh, Taako, as you kind of lift your weight up off the floor as you try to climb it, the floor pops back up into place, and as it does, uh, like a million spikes, uh, eject out of the left and right walls, and all three of you just happen to be in all the right places as the spikes just shoot out around you, and then retract back into the walls as you fall off the wall and put your pressure back down on the floor.
Travis: I do— I, I just wanna— I want everyone to picture this scene. We see Taako start to climb, and Merle and Magnus just step backwards, like [mimes being badass-chill]
Griffin: Oh no no, it’s the entire 50-foot span of the pit. You all are all—
Travis: But we don’t get hit!
Griffin: Yeah you don’t get hit by these spikes, it’s fuckin’ weird! Yeah!
Travis: Um… ok. [audience laughter] So… we live in the pit now. [Griffin & Clint laugh]
Griffin: What do you boys do? [beat] About the pit? [beat] It’s a bad pit!
Travis: Is— Can we see any kind of, uh—
Griffin: The back wall of the pit starts moving in forward towards you. [beat] Fuck you guys. [audience laughter] This is for— This is for Rascal! [Clint laughs]
Travis: [crosstalk] Um, I— What—
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s forty— It’s 40 feet away.
Travis: [crosstalk] What are the walls made out of?
Griffin: Uh, cobblestone. It’s 40 feet away.
Travis: Got it. I’m going to, uh, aim my axe at the [mumbled] breaks in the cobblestone [Griffin cackles][back to normal voice] and wedge it— I’m gonna wedge it in, in where the floor and the wall meet.
Griffin: Okay yeah yeah yeah, you can do that. If you do that, you’ll lose the axe.
Travis: That’s fine, I have the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword Of Doom.
Griffin: [beat] Ok.
Travis: I have that now, I didn’t before.
Griffin: Uh, rollllll—
Travis: Twenty!
Griffin: Oh oh ok, yeah that’s good. That’s the best number that there is. You use your, uh, you use the head of your axe to sort of wedge in—
Travis: It’s not real.
Griffin: Wedge in below the, uh— the, the wall and the floor, there’s a little gap there when you drop the floor down and you can get it in there and hold the floor down.
Travis: Ok, let’s climb out.
Griffin: Uh, the f— the back wall is now 30 feet away.
Travis: We’re climbing out.
Griffin: DO THE FUCKIN’ THINGS, THEN, WITH THE DICE!
Travis: Uh, what is that, Athletics?
Griffin: Yes, or Acrobatics—
Travis: 17.
Griffin:: Ok, Taako—
Justin: It is… 17 for me as well.
Griffin: Taako and Magnus get up. It’s 30 feet away.
Travis: ONE for Clint!
Justin: [crosstalk] It is a one for Clinton.
Travis: [crosstalk] A one-uh for Clint! A one! Numero uno!
Griffin: Oh shit! Dad, you get like halfway up and you fall out so bad that the axe becomes unwedged and the floor pops up. Make a Dexterity saving throw WITH DISADVANTAGE CUZ YOU’RE ON YOUR BACK!
Travis: [beat] Can I use my grappling hook and— [audience laughs]
Griffin: I don’t know what people were cheering for, I think somebody said something very funny in the audience. [Man in the audience: “That’s your dad!”]
Griffin: That’s my dad, yeah. And I’ll fucking KILL HIM IN A SECOND! [audience laughter]
Travis: To be fair, if Griffin kills him, he becomes head of the family—
Justin: AND GETS ALL OF OUR RICHES!
Clint: So…
Travis: Roll again, you have disadvantage.
Clint: DIS-advantage…
Griffin: Yeah that means you do… poorly.
Travis: That’s a ONE!
Justin: That’s a one.
Travis: That’s a ONE!
Justin: [crosstalk] That’s another one on that one.
Travis: [crosstalk] UNA!
Griffin: Uh… Jesus Christ… uh—
Travis: He’s fine!
Griffin: You get lit the fuck up by these spikes this time, you are not in the right place, and they just getchya all over. You take three hearts of damage— are you still alive?
Travis: Yeah, actually. He has four hearts.
Griffin: He has one heart left, but you are prone and on the floor and in a bad sh— sh— shape and the back wall is now ten feet away.
Travis: Can I grappling-hook Merle’s arm?
Griffin: [beat] His wooden arm? With a very good roll, you can. This is the last action—
Clint: Wait! Wait, wait! It’s not your turn, is it?
Griffin: Oh, it’s—
Travis: Do you just wanna die? Is that it? ’Cuz you’re rollin’ ones left and right.
Clint: You—
Travis: Do you want someone with a hot hand to fix it?
Clint: You and Merle’s arm are not a good combination.
Justin: That’s true. I mean it’s—
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’m gonna s— Lemme say—
Travis: [crosstalk] Alright, fine! You know what? You can die.
Griffin: Let me set the stakes! You got one more action and then you’re gonna be crushed by the wall. What do you do to save yourself in this situation?
Travis: I mean I have a magic grappling hook, but… [shrugs]
Clint: [beat] Who are you talking to?
Griffin: YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!
Clint: Well— I—
Griffin: Unless somebody else wants to get you out of there—
Clint: I climb out of the pit—
Griffin: Alright. Do it again. S—
Clint: Leaking blood like a sieve… [rolls die] shit…
Travis: No, tha— It’s a 14.
Griffin: Total?
Travis: [beat] Yeah…
Justin: Add your Dexterity.
Clint: Oh, yeah, I have to add my Dexterity— FOURTEEN.
Travis: Can I help him?
Griffin: Uh, yes. Roll plus Strength to try to grab him.
Travis: Oh, plus Strength? Then that is a 17.
Griffin: Ok, yeah. You reach down and pull him up just as the spikes shoot out—
Travis: And I just stare at him.
Griffin: Uh, just barely missing your feet as the back wall comes in and crushes up against the wall and you are savvveedddddd. [audience applause]
Travis: Yeah!
Clint: [bratty voice] ‘Thank you, Travis.’
Magnus: My name is Magnus!
Griffin: Uh, as you move through the door, uh, on the landing that’s sort of flanked by these torches, you see that same odd phenomenon happen again. The flames freeze and quickly the hallway that you’re entering starts to flicker and glitch out and suddenly the simulation’s just gone. And you are standing in darkness.
And then a large square of light appears on the floor in front of you and some lights overhead kick on, illuminating a stage that the three of you are standing on. Um, and in front of you is an audience of thousands of screaming fans— which I wrote here, and I realize now— [audience cheers]
I promise I didn’t think about the reality of saying that sentence out loud on this stage, um, and in front of them is a small riser where you can see a judge sitting behind a desk. And the lights are in your eyes— you can’t quite see their, their face, but you can see the title of this game as it appears in a stylish font in front of you. And the title is: Move Move Celebration! [audience laughter]
And the judge says [in an accent somewhere between Australian & British]
Judge: Ok, who’s gonna be dancing for us today?
Magnus: Merle?
Merle: Well, I am pretty adept at Interpretive Jazz dance.
Clint: Which will make for some great podcasting!
Travis: But you do have to act it out for real. [audience & Clint laugh]
Griffin: Are you all— Are you all nominating Merle for this task?
Clint: [beat] Bring it!
Travis: I think that’s the funniest choice.
Justin: Yeah, it’s a funny choice.
Griffin: Ok! Uh, Merle, you step forward, the— You see this silhouette of this judge motion you towards the glowing square on the floor.
Travis: Don’t blow it. [beat] What if you only had one shot…
Clint: Ok… Merle does that.
Griffin: Ok! As you—
Travis: Man, wouldn’t it be great if ‘8 Mile’ was a dance movie? That would’ve made that joke way funnier.
Griffin: [laughing] Yeah!
Clint: Well, every little bit helps.
Griffin: If only anybody had ever made a dance movie you could reference.
Travis: Hey, get out there and stomp the yard!
Griffin: Yeah… uh, as you—
Travis: You can do it, honey!
Griffin: As you ste— Oh, Jesus. Travis just made a ‘Honey’ reference during our two-thousand-and-seventeen Adventure Zone live show. Uh, as you step onto that glowing square, some blistering-fast techno music starts pounding through some massive speakers hanging overhead, and then all of a sudden there—
Travis: THE ECSTASY! [Griffin & audience laugh]
Griffin: All of a sudden there are glowing arrows all over you, illuminated on the floor, showing you the steps of an incredibly demanding dance. Roll— we’ve literally never used this skill before— Performance. [audience cheers]
Clint: Pleeeaassseeee…
Travis: He is neutral on this.
Clint: Please! [rolls dice]
Travis: It’s a 13.
Justin: Thirteen.
Travis: I don’t know why I’m reading off Dad’s numbers.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: He can read.
Justin: Are there just— are there just [crosstalk] too many—
Travis: [crosstalk] Numbers.
Clint: I have a plus one in Performance!
Griffin: Ok—
Travis: That’s a 14.
Justin: Are there just—
Clint: FOUR-teen!
Justin: Are there just more— There are just too many— There’s like a lot of buttons—
Griffin: There’s a lot of arrows on the floor for him to—
Justin: And we can’t help him, right?
Griffin: You absolutely can and should help your dad.
Justin: Well, wait. Seems like if he had more legs to help him… [pause, audience laughs] If only I knew someone with four legs! [audience cheers]
Travis: Yeeeeesss!
Justin: This is good.
Clint: ARE YOU WITH US?
Justin: This is good. I cast Phantom Steed. [audience cheers]
Garyl: Yo.
Griffin: [forcefully] It’s time. To dance. Let’s. Do it.
Justin: Garyl is a— if you’ve never listened— is a beautiful bi-nicorn, he’s rainbow-colored and he’s, um… I created him from my heart.
Griffin: All of a sudden, the title of the game pop up again, only this time it says: ‘Dressage Dressage Celebration’. [Clint laughs] Uh Merle, roll again with advantage this time, because technically, you have double the legs as you mount—
Travis: Triple.
Justin: Triple.
Griffin: [beat] Noooo.
Travis: Not making contact with the ground, but if someone with two legs get on someone with four—
Griffin: [exasperated] Alright, roll the dice three times, you have double advantage.
Travis: He’s gonna need it! [Clint rolls] Twelve.
Griffin: Bad!
Travis: [Clint rolls] Two?
Griffin: POOR!
Travis: Come on! Wait, use my regular dice.
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh, this better be a good one now!
Travis: [crosstalk] Don’t get your funk on it! [Clint rolls] ...Twelve.
Clint: Wait, that was Travis’s dice!
Travis: It doesn’t count.
Griffin: What the fuck?!
Clint & Travis: [crosstalk] TWO!! Two! Two, two!!
Justin: [crosstalk] Two!! Two!? Roll again!
Travis: I am trying my best. TWO.
Griffin: [crosstalk] The audience— The audience— no, Dad, you stand RIGHT THERE— the audience boos! [audience boos]
Griffin: And a wave of arrows—
Travis: But then the audience remembers that Dad took care of Griffin—
Justin: Look what you did. Our— our [crosstalk] our elderly dad.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Come on—
Travis: Are you gonna take off your pants!?
Clint: My belt fell off!
Griffin: As the audience boos, a wave of arrows comes shooting out of the audience?
Clint: So I don’t really have to dance.
Griffin: And hits you for two hearts of damage.
Travis: He is dead.
Griffin: Merle explodes in a shower of p— [cackles] no, come back! Merle explodes in a shower of pixels and the life counter drops down to 2.
Justin: I’m assuming the arrows shoot right through Garyl, who’s just like, ‘nice.’
Griffin: Oh yeah, he’s a phantom steed, he’s totally cool.
Travis: But Garyl says, “I’m fine.”
Justin: Can I do one for Garyl to see if he finishes the challenge?
Griffin: Yes, if your phantom steed wants to roll for themselves.
Justin: That’s aaaaaaaaaaaaaa 16.
Griffin: Uh, the audience goes wild for Garyl. [audience cheering]
Travis: MVP, Most Valuable Pony: Garyl. That’s a new movie with Matt LeBlanc coming out.
Griffin: The audience stands up and like— uh, the judge stands up and like, cuts the audience off from their cheering and turns, and there’s a floodlight, a spotlight above that comes up and you can see their face and they’re crying. And they say,
Judge: Garyl?
Garyl: Yo.
Judge: I don’t know how I know your name.
Garyl: Mhmm.
Judge: But you’re going to HOLLYWOOD!
Griffin: And he holds up a ticket! A beautiful golden ticket.
Garyl: Hey, uhm, that sounds cool; in lieu of the ticket could I just have some oatssssss?
Griffin: Uh, and as you say that, the audience starts just throwing oats onto the stage, showering Garyl in oats, and the oats are just hitting Merle in his fuckin’ face. Just like— [demonstrating] [Griffin and Travis laughing]
Clint: 19 years I raised you. [crosstalk] Paid your bills. Put food on your table!
Griffin: [laughing] [crosstalk] Yes I’m 19 years old!
Travis: You know Griffin’s 30, right? Did you just check out after 19? “See me again at the liveshow!”
Clint: He— he set out to find his purpose!
Griffin: As the stage is flooded in oats, the scene freezes, and some of the oats freeze in mid air and it looks so cool. [Clint and Justin laugh] And then the scene dissipates and suddenly you’re back in the hallway walking out of the spike trap room, and uh, uh, Acererak pops into the chat again and says,
Acererak: nice moves, Garyl. impressive.
Garyl: Thank you.
Travis: Wait, is Garyl still there?
Griffin: Uh, no, Garyl’s not here ‘cause it was— Yeah, fuck it, yeah, sure, why not. [Justin: Nice.] Uh, and then BoyDetective15 pops into the chat and says,
Angus: Can someone ban Acererak?
Griffin: But nobody does, and you hear Lucas’s voice again and he says,
Lucas: Listen, I— I don’t know why you keep ending up in other games but you’re really close to the end now, just keep pushing forward.
Travis: Magnus starts running.
Griffin: Okay. Y—
Justin: Taako’s obviously riding Garyl, this isn’t even a question.
Griffin: You approach a long set of stairs, and at the top see an opposing door, behind it, you’re sure, is Acererak’s chambers. The doors at the top of the stairs are [intensely] 14 feet wide, 28 feet tall, they are made of solid mithril, 3 feet thick, and impregnated— g-gross— and impregnated with great magicks in order to make them absolutely spell- and magic-proof. Fuck you, Taako. Where—
Justin: You slowly— you see Taako slowly put the hole-thrower back in his pocket, he had like, already gotten it out.
Griffin: Uh, where these doors meet at about waist-height is a cup-like depression, a hemisphero-cl-tJesus. A hemispherical concavity, uh, just stick with cup-like depression, Gary! [Clint’s laughter]
Travis: Fucking dork!
Griffin: A cup-like depression, a hemispherical concavity with a central hole. What do you do?
Travis: I knock on the door. Polite-ness.
Griffin: Nothing happens.
Travis: Dam-nit.
Justin: Did we have any cups that we didn’t know about?
Griffin: No!
Justin: It’s a cup-like—
Griffin: It’s a— It’s a depression in the door, there’s a little hole in the door.
Travis: How big?
Griffin: Hole-shaped.
Justin: I jam the scepter in it.
Griffin: FUCK YEAH! [audience cheers]
Travis: [unintelligible] Touch! Make ‘em touch! Touch it! [crosstalk]
Clint: I have the scepter!
Griffin: And that’s not how it is, it’s not like that. You know how it actually goes...
Justin: [giggling] Do I?
Griffin: Like the sex joke. [audience laughter]
Justin: Okay, this is a scepter, it’s not dirty! It’s a scepter into the hole!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Uh, okay,
Travis: [crosstalk] He did— he did, uh, if I may explain, ‘cause this is an audio medium— uh, Justin formed a— a circle, with the one hand, and then extended his index finger and inserted, said finger, into the circle, in a gesture, uhh uhh of insertion. [audience laughter]
Clint: Into a door that was already impregnated. [uproarious audience laughter]
Travis: Ok, BYE! That’s gonna do it for us—
Griffin: [crosstalk] The end!
Travis: Wait! [Clint giggling]
Griffin: I just wanna read how bad it could have gotten if Justin— I swear to god I didn’t think you would remember that you had gotten the sceptre, uh, an hour ago— uh, if the door is attacked by force it will not budge but if it’s scratched or nicked it will turn red in that spot, and begin to gush blood. The blood of all those who have died in the tomb, the red flow will cascade down the steps and begin to fill the— it fills the fucking room, and then there’s like, a page of like, if you try to solve it this way, you die, if you try to solve it this way, you die, if you try to burn the blood it turns to poison gas and you die instantly. The tomb of horrors is fucked up.
Clint: Did Jim Jones write this— [crosstalk] particular game?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeahh, for sure. The massive doors swing open. And you enter the demilich’s chamber.
Travis: Hell yeah. I think this is the perfect time here, um, to tell everyone that um, we have a graphic novel coming out.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh, yeah, fuck, we were supposed to do this right after we started, we’ve forgotten now twice— so, uh, before we do this next part, as you leave, uh, everybody here’s gonna be able to get a pack of the Adventure Zone gum? [audience cheers]
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Uh, and that is normally—
Justin: We made it just for you all, like literally just for you guys.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah it’s from— it’s from our friends at First Second who are publishing the graphic novel adaptation, which you can now get— you can now get at Barnes & Noble, Amazon, or at theadventurezonecomic.com, um, and each of the packs of gum has an exclusive little comic, like a Bazooka Joe comic, starring Angus MacDonald! [audience cheering]
So that is— that’s for the graphic novel, it’s the first arc, The Adventure Zone: Here There Be Gerblins, uhh which was illustrated by Carey Pietsch, who is so fucking talented [audience cheers], and that is out July 17th, 2018, and so, if you’re not here and you’re hearing this now you can preorder the graphic novel and you, uh, send your receipt, like a picture of your receipt online to theadventurezonecomic.com you can get all the Bazooka Joe comics in the gum—
Travis: But Dad wrote ‘em,
Justin: Dad wrote the comics, yeah.
Travis: Dad wrote the comics, there’s— there’s three different versions you can get, one featuring Merle, one featuring Magnus, one featuring Taako, all of them have Angus in it.
Justin: So, um, Morgan and Jeremy are gonna be out there, I think they’re in First Second shirts, uh, so everybody just please take one, pass—
Griffin: They have big bags full of gum, they’re gonna be the only ones with big gum bags.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: But make sure you check in with them if you’re leaving so you can go and grab that from them.
Griffin: The massive doors swing shut behind you as you enter the demilich’s chamber, a wide red carpet leads you down from the entrance into this room, and towards a staircase that climbs five feet and up to a dais. Flanking the carpet are six stone columns, three on each side. Atop the dais is a throne, made of large, twisted bones. And the arms of the throne are capped with gold-plated iron.
And sitting on that throne is a skull, and it’s completely motionless. You hear Lucas trying to communicate with you, but he’s breaking up so bad now that you can’t make out what he’s saying? Uh, and then in the lower right corner of your vision a message appears saying, “Users have been disconnected from chat.” What do you do?
Travis: Er, I guess— [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Nah, it’s not real!!
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, that’s fuckin’ scary, don’t— hey, come on!
Clint: Hey, let t— let ‘em have their moment!
Justin: I guess I reboot, usually.
Travis: Yeah.
Clint: And take the cartridge out and blow in it. [blows into mic]
Travis: Yeah. Don’t do that! Oh, no— you got your spit— you gotta put your t-shirt over it and then blow through.
Clint: Oh, is that right?
Travis: Mhm.
Griffin: [strained] What do you do, aasshooles?
Justin: I— I cast “detect traps” now that we’ve been through the entire thing.
Griffin: There’s no traps.
Justin: Perfect.
Travis: I shoot [murmuring] an arrow at the skull.
Griffin: Rollll [murmuring] an attack roll with your bow and arrow.
Travis: [murmuring] mm, dance … [unintelligible]
Clint: Why is everybody talking like Thurston Howell The Third?
Justin: That’s from Gilligan’s Island.
Travis: Not great. Uh, sixteen.
Griffin: That’s enough, it’s a fucking skull. Um,
Travis: It doesn’t dodge?
Griffin: Uh, the skull explodes in a puff of ash.
Travis: Bahbahbahbah bahh bahh ba—! [video game achievement sound]
Griffin: But! But! Uh—
Travis: Bubububut butt butt but bubutt!
Griffin: No! No, it doesn’t do that actually—
Justin: No bababahs.
Griffin: A cloud of black smoke begins to pour out of the cracks between the th— I wrote the throne bones here, which is gross.
Travis: I step behind Taako.
Griffin: Uh, and it hovers menacingly above the dais, and suddenly it starts to take form, and it forms a long tattered black robe, and as it waves about you see a half-decomposed body within. This demilich form though, it doesn’t have a head. But something starts to pop out of the top of the robe, [stage-whispering behind his hand] get ready on that musical cue by the way, [Oh Hey, It’s Hodge Podge! by Griffin McElroy starts playing] uh, taking the place that should be where the head is, it’s a computer monitor! [audience starts to cheer] And after forming, the tubes inside click on and you see a simple pixelated face appear on the screen. And a voice inside the monitor says,
Hodge Podge: I’m Hodge Podge, the buddy-bot! [audience screams] Thanks for playing my deadly game! Didn’t you think Lucas’s training program was more enjoyable with higher stakes?
[a pause. Audience laughter]
Merle: [uncertainly] Yyyyyeahhh?
Hodge Podge: Congratulations on making it this far! Unfortunately you’ve reached the end of the line! Goodbye!
Griffin: Let’s roll initiative. [audience cheers]
Clint: So we get to fight some shit?
Justin: Yeah. It’s time.
Travis: Fourteen.
Griffin: You can fade that music out whenever you want. [Oh Hey, It’s Hodge Podge! fades out quickly]
Justin: Uh, seven for the kid. For Hoops.
Clint: Oh, I have advantage!
Griffin: You sure do.
Clint: That was a four.
Griffin: Good. So you get to it again.
Clint: Haha, you all doubt my prowess. [rolls] And that’s a six. [audience laughter]
Travis: It’s nice that you’re so consistent... -ly bad. No, I love you so much. [Audience aaawwwws]
Griffin: Magnus what did you roll? [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Don’t awww! It’s my dad! I love him!
Griffin: Magnus what did you roll real quick! Tell me!
Travis: I rolled, uuuuuuah fourteen.
Griffin: Alright. Hodge Podge is up first. Um, Hodge Podge gets two actions, on its first action it aims at… Magnus, and shoots a necrotic beam in your direction.
Travis: I am standing behind Taako, I did just say that.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Taako! The beam hits you! 21? Versus AC?
Justin: Yeap, that hits.
Griffin: Uh, you take two hearts worth of damage.
Justin: Hachi machi.
Griffin: How’s Taako doin’? Still pretty good, right?
Justin: I mean, he’s got one heart.
Griffin: Alright. [crosstalk] two hearts.
Justin: No, wait wait wait, he [crosstalk] d-d-d-d-died.
Griffin: Oh.
Justin: He only had one heart left.
Griffin: Oh yeah, Taak—
Justin: Anyway, g—
Taako: Good fight everybody!
Griffin: Taako explodes—
Clint: Wait, so the hearts don’t regenerate every—
Griffin: No. Taako explodes into a shower of pixels and the counter at the top of the screen now says, 1. Taako, you reappear at the center of the room—
Travis: [crosstalk] That’s one more, though, so.
Griffin: Uh, next up I need all of you to make a wisdom saving throw.
Travis: Which we’ll have advantage on, thank you Dad. [audience cheering] Thank god. I rolled an 18. Clinton rolled a Nat 20. [audience cheers wildly] He’s the smartest man!
Clinton: And I just injured my shoulder, stretchin’ out like that!
Griffin: Taako, how’d you do?
Justin: Seven, for the kid.
Griffin: Taako disappears.
Justin: Ah, well. Win— [crosstalk]
Travis:With advantage?
{90:32}
Justin: Win some, lose some.
Griffin: Magnus, you’re up next.
Justin: Wait, did I lose a life, or I just disappeared?
Griffin: No, you didn’t lose a life, just dis—
Justin: Okay. Cool.
Travis: I— let me look at all my spell cards, umm— I’m going to attack him. With the [mumbling] Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Griffin: Alright. [audience cheers] Do that shit. [dice rolling]
Travis: ‘S, uh, 21.
Griffin: Yeah, that’ll hit this one.
Travis: And then, uh,
Griffin: It does 20 bonus damage, I think?
Travis: Tw— well, yeah 24… total…
Justin: It’s a very good sword.
Travis: [crosstalk] Very good sword.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Really good sword.
Travis: [murmuring] That’s a 3, plus 24, 27?
Justin: [out the side of his mouth] Can we top side— stop side-talking?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Yes, TWENTY-SEVEN.
Griffin: Uh, you see three hearts float up and away from this lich form, uh, as you hit it with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Travis: And you know what, I’mma check, I’m gonna— attack it again
Griffin: Do it again, yeah. Did we talk about how— did we— have we put any limitations on the Raging— Flaming Poisoning Sword of— no, fuck.
Justin: Try it.
Travis: Alright. That’s a Nat 20. [audience cheers] [makes clicking noises] So that’s gonna be… damage twice? That’s a four—
Griffin: It doesn’t do the fuckin’, 20 extra fire damage twice though.
Travis: I think it does. So that’s… um, 48… plus seven… ‘s 55? Damage?
Griffin: Fuck…
Justin: [laughing] It is a VERY, VERY good sword!
Griffin: You see five hearts float up and away from the lich form.
Travis: [crosstalk] And then I’ll use my third attack… [audience cheers] ‘S a 17, plus ten, 27?
Griffin: That one misses, it’s fucked up. [audience laughter]
Travis: Ah, that’s a o— ah, it’s only one damage, so 25 total. I want you to picture Magnus doing this very calmly and methodically.
Griffin: Uh, okay, two— two hearts float away, uh, from the lich, uh, Hodge Podge, and as they do, the form crumples into ash. [Justin cackling] And then, the throne of bone collapses, and the demilich Hodge Podge appears once again in front of you.
Travis: I’m going to action-surge,
Griffin: Jesus Christ. [audience cheers]
Travis: And I’m gonna attack again,
Griffin: ‘Kay.
Travis: Calmly, rationally, [rolls die] that’s a one! [laughs] [slow clapping from someone on the panel]
Clint: That means a hundred and one points’a damage!
Travis: [crosstalk] And Magnus just— “M’okay.”
Justin: “Alright!”
Griffin: Uh, Taako, you’re up next— Taako, you were teleported away.
Justin: Yep.
Griffin: And now you’re sitting on the back of a boat on a serene lake. And joining you this time on the boat, [clears throat] is a big bass, who is sitting at the back of the boat with a big floppy hat on, and a fin on the motor, in the same position Rascal was in before? And he looks at you and he goes, [flapping noises]. And as you look around, like, this scene actually looks really fucked up?
Like, the trees are upside down [Travis(?): No.] all around the coast, um, and there’s like, no sun in the sky, and the sky is red, and like, the water is moving in a weird like glitchy way, like there’s a wave, and then a little freeze, [Justin(?): Okay.] and then there’s another wave— um, and the fish goes [fish noises] and motions you towards a fish and tackle box at the front of the boat, and as you look in that direction you see something poking out of the water, it’s a biiiiiiiig floppy hat, and then it’s Rascal’s face? Only it’s huge. And kind of monstrous. And he screams,
Rascal: WEEELCOME TO BIIIIIG BASSSS CHALLENGE!
Griffin: And splashes back down into the water, rocking your boat. Uh, and in front of you, big words appear that say, “Catch one big bass to proceed”, only the words ‘big bass’ glitch out and are replaced with the words “Rascal”. What do you do? [pause]
Travis: Yeah, that one I like!
Justin: Um— mm. Yeah, [chuckles] okay, I’m going to cast Maze on Rascal. [pause]
Griffin: I don’t know what that means but I know it’s not gonna be good!
Justin: So, the fir— you— okay, heheh, I—
Griffin: Just describe what happens to Rascal.
Justin: I banish Rascal to a labyrinthine demiplane.
Clint: Awwwww, not Rascal!
Justin: He is there until he can escape. He can use his action to attempt an escape, and, uh, if it succeeds— uh, makes a DC 20 Intelligence check— if it succeeds it escapes and the spell ends, uh, a minotaur automatically succeeds, but I assume Rascal is not a—
Griffin: That’s a Nat 20 for Rascal! Solving the infinity maze!
Justin: Well that’s very fine but it wasn’t his turn, it was my turn. So get in the maze.
Griffin: Okay. Rascal’s up next,
Justin: Okay,
Griffin: He rolled a Nat 20 on his—
Justin: Naahokaynahnahnahnah. [Griffin laughs] Nice try.
Griffin: Uh, that is a 19. Versus, whatever your shit is.
Justin: It’s a— a 20. Aw, close, [sings] yet so far away. [Griffin laughs]
Clint: 20-ish!
Justin: You used up that 20 magic when you— you didn’t— it wasn’t your turn. [Griffin laughs] He got to the end and was like, “I did it!” Then he was like, “Well, let’s hold on!”
Griffin: Uh, he’s having some trouble negotiating the maze— because his body is just a big fish-body. And so it’s taking him a long time to flop around, and so now you’re just on a boat with a big fish.
Taako: This is good. This is fine.
Griffin: And the fish puts a fin— [crosstalk]
Taako: [crosstalk] This is fine.
Griffin: The fish puts a fin on your shoulder and goes— [fish noise]
Taako: Hey, fins to the left.
Travis: Finish the lyric. [crosstalk] Finish the l—
Griffin: That’s— a Jimmy Buffett…?
Justin: Yep—
Taako: I have a sore spot right here, fins to the left, a little bit more to the left— ahh, you got it.
Griffin: Uh, I guess— Next in the order is Merle, back in the fight with the demilich.
Clint: Merle casts Guardian of Faith.
Griffin: Alright. [audience cheers]
Clint: But— but wait, there’s more. Just when the gigantic, spirit form of Della Reese—
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: Materializes, he uses the Strongmouse Amulet [crosstalk] which allows him— which allows him to make a brilliant jape—
Griffin: Oh jesus, this is gonna tank. You can’t call your shot like this, Babe Ruth.
Clint: [crosstalk] Why, WHY? HE TAKES LIKE 25 FREAKIN’ TURNS!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Alright, do it. Do it, do it. What’s your joke, and again, if it fails, you’ll die.
Clint: Well— I think we’ll leave it up to the audience to decide if it’s a great jape or not.
Travis: Okay, wait, wait wait wait wait, this is important… don’t patronize him. If you don’t like it, just stay silent.
Justin: It’s gotta be fair.
Griffin: Hey, can we start saying that before all, all our live show jokes? “Don’t fuckin’ patronize us, only— be legit, now.”
Clint: It’s all I got, it’s the only— [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Alright, whatcha got.
Clint: So this gigantic Della Reese forms in the sky—
Travis: [crosstalk] So hey, here’s the deal!
Griffin: [crosstalk] So uh, what’s the deal with all these gigantic Della Reese angels—
Clint: —And I say to the [chuckling] gigantic Della Reese, “TOUCH THEM, MY ANGEL!” [a pause, weak cheers, a mic hitting the table]
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, that was very loud,
Justin: [crosstalk] No, come on, pick the mic up!
Griffin: And also not— fix it—
Justin: No, that was nothing.
Clint: [crosstalk] THEY LOVED IT!
Griffin: Yeah, okay, you don’t die, so what happens now?
Clint: I don’t remember, I just came up with it!
Justin: Hachi machi.
Griffin: The lich Hodge Podge starts to lose its form after you hit it with this attack that it was weak to, uh, what is your joke now, Merle? What is your hot one-liner now as Hodge Podge lich starts to lose its composure in front of you, and I’m saying this because it’s almost, [intensely] 12:30 in the fucking morning.
Clint: I thou— I— I put my—
Griffin: You have one chance—
Clint: My touch wasn— my touch— my angel?
Griffin: No! Another one! I demand it! [audience laughter]
Clint: Uh— uhhm, m— [audience members shout suggestions] Liches get stitches. [audience uproar] [Clint giggling]
Griffin: Hodge— Hodge Podge’s spectral form rears up and his hands are thrown to his side and bolts of electricity starts coursing through his body, and it looks like he’s about to explode in a truly spectacular fashion, and then, your vision just turns blue and an error log pops up? And uh, through that you see Hodge Podge collapse to the floor anticlimactically. [Clint laughs]
And the chat reappears with a chorus of users all saying, “GG.” And— [audience cheers] and suddenly, the three of you are awake and lying down in Lucas’s lab and you feel a uniquely unpleasant sensation as whatever device was connecting you to this virtual world detaches itself from the back of your head. And there’s Lucas, and he’s grimacing, kind of awkwardly, and he says,
Lucas: You guys aren’t gonna let me do science to you anymore, are you.
Travis: “Did I do that?” [Clint laughs]
Griffin: And that’s the end of the adventure! [audience screams] Today on Adventure Zone Live! Thank you all for joining us! Get your gum!
Travis: Grab your gum on the way out!
Griffin: We’ll see you next time!
Clint: Get your gum! Get your gum!
Travis: We’re doing our signing at booth 2800 tomorrow!
Justin: Yeah yeah! That’s good!
Griffin: Yeah, we’re doing a signing! Alright, bye!
Justin: And also, Cut/Sew made my outfit and I like it a lot.
Travis: Thank you we love you.

[Intro music fades in, audience cheers.]
Griffin: Hi, San Francisco, welcome to The Adventure Zo-o-one.
[cheers]
Griffin: I was about to start introducing us, but I… everyone here is dressed like our characters, so I think that would be unnecessary. Uh, so—
Travis: Oh wait, real quick, before we get started, before we get into anything, can we get some house lights up, please?
Griffin: Oh, yeah, I wanna see that cosplay.
Justin: Let’s see it. [Griffin: Woah.] Anybody dressed up?
Travis: If you’re in cosplay, stand up! Stand up.
[Chorus of appreciative “yeah”s from all four.]
Justin: You wild animals.
Travis: Now, we haven’t done this before, but if you think you are dressed as the most deep-cut, esoteric character, stay standing up.
Griffin: [laughs] Boyland! We got a Boyland.
[crosstalk regarding cosplays]
Travis: Fantasy Costco.
Griffin: We’ve got somebody dressed up as the Fantasy Costco.
Travis: We got a Voidfish. There’s a Steven up there! Yeah!
[cheers]
Justin: Very good!
Travis: Hell yeah!
Griffin: Alright, let’s get those house lights off. I’m, uh, shaking... with... fear! [nervous laughter]
Justin: Ding ding ding ding. Ah, there they go, and they’re gone! Just me and my twenty closest friends.
Griffin: It’s imperative that you all don’t yell things at the stage during the show—
Travis: We spook easily.
Griffin: We’ve never announced that at the beginning of the show, [Justin: Yeah.] but a lot of people wanna yell suggestions for cool spells… they wanna yell the rules...
Clint: And we don’t do cool spells.
Griffin: Well, Justin does. They wanna yell the rules of D&D.
Justin: We used to have somebody in our first couple live shows.
Griffin: Oh, yeah.
Justin: We actually appointed— what did we call it? [chorus of “archivist”] The archivist. Which was somebody to sit in the audience with the D&D Player’s Handbook, and correct us on the rules. What the fuck were we thinking?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Seriously!
Clint: We would do an hour and a half, and… 88 minutes of it was the person correcting us.
Justin: We— Yeah. I remember when we stopped, because at a show we did in L.A., the archivist was tragically wedgied to death, and… We’ll always remember you, Dylan, wherever you may be, I presume Hell. But thank you, for all your help.
Griffin: Also that’s not gonna be a cool watch for them.
Justin: Yeah, that’s not fun for them. They paid their money.
Travis: All right, I am in, basically, a corset. So let’s move it along!
Griffin: Let’s get rolling! Alright, let’s get started.
Travis: [gasps strenuously]
Griffin: Your adventure begins, as almost all of our live adventures begin, with a letter. You each received it in the mail several days ago. It’s been nearly a year— [muttering into microphone] spoilers for, uh, TAZ Balance— [normal voice] since the Day of Story and Song, [mild cheers] and still— it was a rough day, y’all, you don’t gotta cheer for that. And still your inboxes remain in a constant state of being blown up. But this letter caught your eye, solely because of who sent it. It read:
Davenport: Hey, gang, it’s your captain here.
[audience cheers]
Travis: Cap’nport!
Davenport: Your former captain, I should say. You’ve all been off my payroll for some time, but I hope you still have some fondness for me, ‘cause I’ve got kind of a big ask for you today. I’ve fallen into a spot of trouble. See, I’ve run up some debts with some unsavory characters all across the Sword Coast, and they’ve come to collect. I’m a bit low on liquid assets at the moment, which, as you can imagine, they’re not terribly pleased about. Fortunately, I’ve found a way to take care of the situation. No, Taako, it doesn’t involve killing all of them in a huge and fiery explosion. I’ve found a way to pay them back and then some.
During my many travels on the waters of this wonderful world, I’ve found a sunken ship [Travis gasps] that’s chock full of treasure for the taking.
Clint: Harrrrr!
Davenport: Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to recover it on my own. I sail by myself most of the time, and—
[Audience laughter, followed by Griffin’s laughter. Unsure of context.]
Davenport: And though my yacht is a capable vessel, hoisting wreckage is a bit above my considerable capabilities. [Justin: Yesss.] So I’m writing in the hopes that you’ll be willing to sail with me, back out to the wreckage—
All Three: No.
Travis: Fuck off!
Griffin: Thanks for coming, everybody! Thanks to the Warfield.
Clint: Thanks everybody! We love you, San Francisco! [blows kisses]
Davenport: I hope you’ll be willing to sail with me back out to the wreckage and recover it as a team, for old times’ sake.
Travis: And money?
Davenport: Once I pay back my—
Travis: We’re not talking, I just— [crosstalk] it’s just a letter. And money?!
Griffin: It’s actually a magic letter. Like, uh, Harry Potter magic letters?
Travis: Uh-huh?
Davenport: Once I pay back my debtors, you’re welcome to split the remainder. It should be enough, uh, more than enough for each of you to buy your own boats, if you wish. I cannot recommend it enough. There are few investments in this life that are wiser than buying a big, big boat.
[laughter]
Davenport: I’ll be casting off from the docks at Westbreak in three days. I sincerely hope you all will be aboard when I do. Your friend, Davenport.
Travis: [singing] I’m already there!
Taako: Ok, I know what he said, but hear me out, I have another plan. We find all the pirates that he owes money to, and we kill them all in a fiery explosion. Now hear me out.
Magnus: Oh! Now. [Merle: What does—] If I may. And this isn’t usually Magnus’s thing, but... maybe there’s a voice in my head called Travis. I don’t know, random name. We wait until all the pirates are together to collect the money.
Taako: Yes?
Magnus: And then we kill all of them, keep the money.
Justin: I say we let him go.
Griffin: If y’all want, I can press control-A and delete everything in this document.
Justin: No, no, no, let’s do it.
Travis: I just recently did a game with Chris Perkins, and there was a part where they were walking to the next thing—
Griffin: Oh, so sorry, I fuckin’ get it, I’m not Chris Perkins.
Travis: And he said— Well, I just said Chris Perkins was a real pro— and he said as they were walking, like, “So, what do you do as you walk there?” and I was like “What? What do you mean? No, you’re just there.”
Justin: We’re just there.
Griffin: You all arrive at the Westbreak Docks at the appointed time and find a lively scene waiting for you. Despite the fact that most of the docks aren’t in operation— many lie shattered, you assume, from the Hunger’s attack nearly one year ago. [mutters into microphone] Spoilers for TAZ Balance.
[normal voice] A dozen small fishing vessels are preparing to depart on their daily trips into the nearby reefs. Amidst the hubbub of these preparations, you spot one another near the central dock. I don’t know how often you three actually meet up these days. What is this—
Justin: Every other month.
Griffin: Wow.
Justin: Approximately.
Clint: Yeah. Yeah, we get together, play a little euchre.
[pause]
Griffin: Don’t you need—
Travis: Fantasy euchre, don’t worry.
Clint: Fantasy euchre, yeah.
Griffin: Who’s your fourth?
Clint: The fourth is, uh...
Travis: Rotates.
Griffin: You could name literally any character right now and get a cheer from the audience.
Clint: Garyl!
[audience cheers]
Justin: No. Absolutely not. Don’t applaud that, that doesn’t make sense.
Griffin: [softly] You all have to set a higher bar for us. We can’t just... say the names of characters. Or else that’s—
Travis: Maybe it’s the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom!
Griffin: Stop.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Maybe it’s the Millenium Falcon! [Griffin laughs] Maybe. Just. It’s something else.
Travis: Aubrey shows up and plays with us.
Griffin: You—
Travis: It’s all one universe!
Griffin: I’m stopping this right now. You hear a loud “ahoy!” come from—
Magnus: Ahoy!
Griffin: ...Come from the docks in front of you.
Justin: Travis gave us a speech literally thirty seconds before we came on, which was, and I quote, “let’s try to make sure Griffin can get through his introduction.”
Clint: “Let’s not interrupt him.”
Travis: But then I got to be a pirate!
Justin: Then it got to be too much. He’s just bloviating bullshit. Let’s just let the little kid talk, and then we’ll do some other junk.
Griffin: No, I’m loving it. I have barely anything prepared if…
Justin: Okay, fine.
Griffin: You hear a loud “ahoy!” come from the docks in front of you, from the largest and nicest ship in the harbor. It’s a long vessel with a solid wood construction, painted a glistening pearl color. Two ruby red sails at the center and stern of the ship are raised, though you see some imposing figure on the ship beginning the process of untying their bindings, preparing to raise the anchor. It’s a beautiful boat. Through, uh— Towards the rear of the ship, you notice some patches of unpainted wood covering up some considerable damage, with scorch marks barely peeking out from behind them.
Justin: Can I roll a history check to see if I recognize the symbols on the boat?
Griffin: ...Sure.
Justin: It’s an eighteen, plus five. So I made ‘em up, pretty much.
Griffin: Uh, the symbols on the boat— there’s just one.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: It’s a name, painted out n the side.
Clint: Garyl!
Travis: And is he able to read it?
Griffin: He is, it says: “The Wavesmasher.”
Justin: Mm. Very good. Very good.
Griffin: You take it that Daven— With that roll, you assume Davenport has sort of adopted a certain naming convention for…
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: All ships.
Justin: You know what’s funny, in my head? I had the words “Wavehumper” in there.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Oh, I like yours better.
Griffin: Oh, I’m sorry, I misread.
Justin: Did you?
Griffin: Yeah, ‘cause of the font— let me increase the font size. It says Wavehumper.
Justin: Okay, good. I thought it might say Wavehumper.
Griffin: And bounding down the gangplank, you see Davenport. At least, you presume it’s Davenport. A year at sea has changed his aesthetic dramatically. He’s got long, unkempt gray hair now, gathered in two sections in bearded tails. And peeking out from behind that hair, you see an impressive salt-and-pepper goatee. Your once neat-and-tidy captain has become a bit of a sea dog in the year since you last saw him.
Travis: Now, does he look more like Dad, or Captain Ron?
Griffin: Captain Ron.
Travis: Okay.
Justin: Thank you-u-u.
Griffin: And he yells as he approaches you,
Davenport: I knew I could count on you three! How the hell are ya?
Magnus: Pretty fuckin’ good!
Taako: Uh, we’re very well. Uh, h— Th— It sounds like things are not going great with you though, my man.
Davenport: Oh yeah, the debts are so… much of them. And…
Taako: Yeah.
Davenport: It’s gonna be great, though, when I don’t have the debts anymore, [crosstalk] because of the adventure, that we’re gonna do.
Taako: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Magnus: [crosstalk] Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Taako: How come you didn’t parley your world-saving success, and fame and fortune?
Davenport: Spent it.
Taako: [skeptically] Spent it.
Magnus: Ah. You spent your credentials on— you spent your reputation?
Merle: We got paid?
Magnus: No. Not as such.
Justin: Just the licensing.
Clint: Oh, right.
Travis: And merch!
Griffin: Davenport says,
Davenport: It’s just gonna be us, I think. Lucretia responded, and said she’s finishing up Neverwinter for a big reopening ceremony. She offered to send some money instead, which was… awfully nice of her. Barry and Lup didn’t respond at all, which, honestly, I don’t really know what I was expecting there.
Griffin: Another figure comes down the gangplank from Davenport’s ship. She’s an orc wearing a black duster over a white linen shirt and ratty brown pants, with an eyepatch over one of her scarred-up eyes. She’s large enough to carry what appears to be a moderately-sized ship’s cannon strapped to her back. On her hip is a long cutlass in a plain black scabbard. She approaches your party and she says,
Swashbuckler: Wind’s finally in our favor, and—
Magnus: Ahoy!
Swashbuckler: Ahoy.
Merle: Harrr!
Griffin: She says,
Swashbuckler: Sorry, what am I thinking. Ahoy. Ahoy.
[crosstalk of “ahoy”]
Taako: Ahoy!
Swashbuckler: Wind’s finally in our favor, captain, we should set sail before we lose our window.
Griffin: And then she give you all each one more round of the ‘goodbye’ ahoy.
Justin: Sure.
Travis: Bahoy.
Griffin: Bahoy.
Justin: You know, pirates have 37 words for ‘ahoy.’
Griffin: And she—
Travis: But no word for money!
Justin: Think about it.
Travis: Mm.
Griffin: And she walks back onto the ship. And Davenport says—
Magnus: Who was that?!
Davenport: That’s Orla. She’s a local merc that offered to come along for the journey.
Taako: Sorry, Or—
Griffin: I’m just watching pieces of cosplay just falling.
Travis: It’s really fucking hot!
Griffin: That’s true.
Clint: It is hotter than hell over here.
Travis: Fuck!
Justin: It’s like an after-party at GenCon in here.
Griffin: He says,
Davenport: She’s a local merc that offered to come along for the journey. I hired her in case the rest of you didn’t actually show up—
Magnus: [offended] Oh, cool.
Davenport: Which I don’t really think you can blame me for.
Taako: Fair.
Davenport: You all ready to head out? We’ll be gone for a couple of days, and convenience stores are hard to come by on the open ocean.
Travis: Um, I assume with vehicle proficiency, I know a lot about boats?
Clint: What’s the left side called?
Travis: That’s the…? Port.
Justin: Port.
Griffin: You helped him.
Travis: I know aft—
Clint: This is not Password!
Travis: I know aft and stern, port and starboard.
Griffin: After a full day of relatively, and literal, smooth sailing, night falls, and Davenport summons your party below decks for a nice meal he’s prepared. He removes the lid off a steaming pot of seafood stew, which he delivers to each of you around the dining table in the galley, alongside a hunk of day-old, but still relatively tasty, bread.
Travis: Magnus is already talking about how the sea has changed him…
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: How his time out here and, oh, the open ocean can really get to someone— You know like, a lot of that.
Griffin: Ocean friendship bracelets, which is sort of a new concept he’s developed.
Travis: Yeah! A lot of ‘oh I’ve really found myself, you know I thought I knew what it meant to be Magnus, but here—’ A lot of that? And it’s all horseshit.
Griffin: Sure. Over dinner, Davenport says,
Davenport: So uh, how’s life post interdimensional adventures treating each of you?
Merle: Gahh, the kids are a pain in the ass.
Griffin: Woah!
Justin: Woah!
Clint: That was not a character voice, that was me talking about you guys!
Justin: Charming.
Travis: Happy Father’s Day Weekend!
Clint: That’s why I can do it!
Justin: Charming.
Magnus: Uh, going good, I’m thinking of opening a dog training school. Haven’t yet, canonically, but I’m thinking about it.
Davenport: There a lot of money in that, ya think?
Magnus: Nooo, I’m planning on losing a lot of money that I hope to make on this voyage!
Griffin: He says,
Davenport: Well I’m glad you’ve found something to keep you busy, Magnus. I’ve been struggling with that myself, if I’m being honest. I tried to find more sort of, stuff I could help out with, but, uh… it’s just been me and the sea for a while, which is kind of how I… like it. I kind of know that I’m playing the back nine as it were, I’m a little too old to start over somewhere, so finding some new life to lead just doesn’t sound good to me right now. Y’all aren’t having trouble readjusting now that we’re sort of settling in?
Magnus: [unsure] ...No?
Davenport: Oh. Just me then. Alright.
Clint: Awhh.
Magnus: Hey…
Taako: You know, uh…
Clint: Davenport. [Justin sighs exasperatedly] I thought you’d forgotten!
Taako: Some people take a while to find their thing, you know? Like, find their stride? Like, uh… the guy who wrote Moby Dick! That took him forever! Lot of words in that one. And that’s the kind of thing that maybe you’re just in the middle of your… dick, and you don’t— it’ll take a while to find your stride, maybe. Maybe piracy was the wrong path and this is the universe’s way of telling you: “Hey, go ashore”.
Magnus: Become a land pirate!
Taako: A land pirate!
Magnus: Not enough of those!
Merle: Open up a bait shop!
Davenport: [sarcastically] Yeah, that sounds fulfilling.
Justin: There’s somebody who owns a bait shop in here like, “Awh. Actually, I have a lot of good conversations with fish people.”
Griffin: Uh, Orla, who’s dining with you, speaks up, and she says,
Orla: You know, I, uh, found my life on the sea too, Davenport. I lost my home, it was destroyed when I was just a child, and I found a new home on the ocean. That feeling when you lookout on the horizon, and there’s nothing but endless water in every direction, that’s- that can be home too. Don’t listen to these three clowns who are telling you to open a bait shop somewhere!
Magnus: To be fair, only one of us said bait shop.
Merle: And it was me.
Justin: Who? Clint McElroy on this boat? Amazing!
Travis: Clint McElroy is a custodian on a completely different planet!
Griffin: Uh, Davenport kinda shakes himself and puts on a smile and he says,
Davenport: Alright, well we should arrive at the wreckage at sunrise. You all should get some sleep, we’ve got a big day ahead of us.
Travis: Magnus does. Right there at the table.
Griffin: You retire from the galley to the sleeping quarters except for Magnus, who just instantly falls asleep at the table.
Clint: And we drag his ass to his hammock.
Travis: Nope, no, he’s too heavy for that! He’s sleeping at the table.
Griffin: Taako and Merle, you find with this—
Justin: Taako wakes up in the middle of the night. And he goes to Davenport’s cabin.
Griffin: Okay.
Taako: Hey, listen… bad news. I think I’ve got scurvy. I’m not sure what the signs of scurvy are. But I’ve been out here for what feels like 13 fuckin’ years, and I’m— how would I know if I have scurvy?
Davenport: Well, what’s your symptoms, pal?
Taako: ...Bored? Salt taste?
Davenport: Salt taste.
Taako: Salt, there’s like a salty taste all the time? So I’m bored and salt taste, and some mild nausea.
Davenport: Can I— show me those chompers… You’re good.
Taako: Really?
Davenport: Yeah.
Taako: You can tell from the teeth!
Clint: From the teeth!
Taako: Like a veterinarian! I never— so there’s the answer, I guess. Well, thanks anyway, sorry to wake ya.
Davenport: No problem, I—
Taako: Do you have any limes, though? As long as I’m here I hate to go back empty-handed. Or empty-citrus.
Davenport: I got a grapefruit.
Justin: Did you roll to see if you had a grapefruit?
Griffin: He has a grapefruit.
Taako: I actually don’t love grapefruit.
Magnus: You gotta put some salt— wait, no, this is Travis,
Travis: You gotta put some salt on there—
Griffin: Magnus is just there. He’s just been standing in the door the whole time.
Magnus: Yo! Scurvy?
Taako: Okay, sorry to wake you, I’ll take the grapefruit and try to muscle up the courage to take a nibble. Maybe it’s a “juice in case of emergency” situation, I’ll just keep it on a shelf.
Griffin: It’s the following morning. You all awaken in the different rooms you slept in, for some reason, and head above deck, and see the sight described by Orla the previous evening. There’s no land in sight, just infinite ocean in every direction.
Travis: Magnus loses it.
Griffin: Uh-oh. I thought Magnus was a sailor boy.
Travis: But then he’s okay.
Justin: What a rich bit that was.
Clint: Ah, how’s this, Merle starts to puke.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: There is one point of interest that breaks up this vista of endless ocean, though. Directly in front of your ship, you see a few planks of wood stitched together to form a makeshift raft. Slumped over it, and clinging to the side of this piece of wreckage, you see a hooded figure with its head down, seemingly passed out cold. What do you do?
Magnus: Ahoy!
Taako: Ahoy.
Merle: [while retching] Ahoy.
Justin: Uh, I’m gonna roll a— how far away are we?
Griffin: You’re a good fifty feet away. It does not respond to your “ahoy”s.
Justin: Pfft. Asshole. You know what, I’m gonna do a perception check to see if I sense anything else there, and see if I can pick up any other details. And we are looking at a… 19.
Griffin: With a 19, your eagle elven eyes peer into the distance, and you get a better look at the shape of this figure slumped over the raft, and you see that its hand is a skeletal hand, and that it is moving a little bit.
Justin: Oh. My. God.
Travis: Well here’s the bad news. Magnus has already leapt over the side to go save this person.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: So I am going to execute a perfect dive.
Clint: No, you’re not.
Travis: Well… is that athletics? Is athletics swimming?
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: That’s a 19.
Griffin: Uh, good dive, dude.
Clint: Was it a ‘phoon? Did you do a ‘phoon?
Travis: No, it was a sick-ass dive—
Griffin: A single drop of water just “bloop”! And you swim over to the raft?
Travis: I leap out of the water like a dolphin and land upon the raft.
Griffin: Alright, you dolphin-swim through the water, and leap up on the raft as Davenport’s ship continues at speed towards it. And, what do you do, you’re at the raft.
Magnus: Hello friend!
Griffin: It, uh, looks up at you, the shape does, and it is, in fact, totally a skeleton with a bright gold tooth.
Magnus: I’ve met skeletons before!
Griffin: It slashes at you with a dagger at its waist.
Magnus: I get it, I know you’re a little stressed out right now, my man! Stuck out here on a raft while we could be [unintelligible] skeletal friends!
Griffin: That’s a 24 versus AC.
Travis: Eff.
Magnus: Ow! Listen, I get it, you’re mad. I’ve changed a lot in the last year.
Griffin: It buries a crooked knife in your shoulder for 14 points of damage.
Justin: Damn.
Travis: That’s nothing. I don’t know— I know we probably should roll initiative, but I’m just going to— it’s half— like, it’s a Jack kind of situation, right, like “I’ll never let go,” it’s off the raft, in the water, right? It’s like, clinging to the side of the raft?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: I’m gonna punt it.
Griffin: Okay.
[Sound of dice rolling, someone sucks air in through their teeth]
Justin: No you’re not.
Travis: Well, it’s a 13?
Griffin: No. It grabs your ankle in midair and slashes it—
Travis: No!
Justin: Just let it happen, it’s— do it for the vine. Do it for the vine.
Griffin: It only rolled a 13 on its attack at you, so you don’t have to—
Travis: Okay, so it missed.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: [mumbled] At least I probably have something.
Justin: It’s good to let the vines happen sometimes, Travis.
Travis: Yeah, I know.
Justin: It can be better for the drama to—
Griffin: This raft that you’re standing on, uh, it explodes, knocking you backwards, up into the air, and then down into the ocean. And Merle and Taako, you see from behind you, on the deck of Davenport’s ship, you see Orla, holding her ship’s cannon, with smoke coming out the end.
Justin: Nice! Woah, write it down everybody, we finally got saved by a competent woman.
Griffin: Uh, and Davenport walks out of the captain’s quarters and and throws you a life, uh… ring. What are those… life preserver, as he floats by and fishes Magnus back up into—
Magnus: It was a skellington!
Griffin: He says,
Davenport: Yeah.
Clint: Were we supposed to— I thought it was somebody we knew. Was it somebody we—
Justin: Not everything’s a callback.
Griffin: Not every character’s gonna be a callback.
Clint: Okay, alright, that’s cool. The gold tooth kinda threw me.
Griffin: Do you know Joe Pesci from Home Alone? Like, what’s the fuckin… Davenport says,
Davenport: Okay, so… confession time. I haven’t been completely honest with you all about why I brought you out here today.
Magnus: Uh-huh.
Davenport: So first off, and someone please be ready to catch Taako as he faints, there’s no sunken treasure.
Justin: Taako faints.
Clint: Nobody catches him.
Travis: No, I rolled a 15—
Clint: Of course you did.
Travis: Dexterity, uh, plus 2 is 17.
Griffin: Easy catch.
Justin: Thank you so much.
Davenport: Silver lining, though, your buddy Davenport isn’t wracked with debt, so that’s… something, at least?
Magnus: So are we just, “Oh, it’s a picnic”?
Davenport: No…
Griffin: He says,
Davenport: There’s an undead pirate ship that tried to destroy my boat while I was out here just a few days ago. I was just minding my own business, it came along, and it was just like, “Rahhhh” and “Bfffff.” I managed to escape and I met Orla while I was drowning my sorrows back at Westbreak. Apparently this ghost ship’s brought down several dozen other non-ghost ships over the the last year or so, so I know I said my days of heroism are behind me, but that’s just not gonna fly, personally speaking. I wouldn’t leave something like that out here, potentially endangering other oceanic explorers like myself who are just trying to find some peace and quiet out here. So, I brought you all in to help me take it down. And I’m sorry for lying, I just haven't spoken to you all in a while and I didn’t know if I could count on you to still be in the… hero business.
Magnus: Coulda asked.
Clint: Merle casts Cure Wounds.
Travis: Why? Oh, on me?
Griffin: The idea of Travis— of Magnus being healed is just so alien to Travis.
Clint: Yes, he got stabbed, right?
Griffin: What’s Cure Wounds do?
Clint: Cure Wounds, of course, Griffin!
Justin: Get comfortable.
Clint: A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
Griffin: Go ahead and roll 1d8 for me.
Clint: 1d8.
Griffin: Got it? First try. That’s it.
Clint: 1d8. It’s a 1.
Griffin: Juicy, juicy.
Travis: Actually, that’s a 7!
Griffin: That’s a 7.
Clint: Wait, that’s a 7?
Travis: Yeah!
Griffin: Yeah, alright—
Clint: Ah. What language is this? It’s a 7 plus my spellcasting modifier.
Griffin: Which is 5 or 6, so we’ll say… full-health Magnus!
Clint: You’re freakin’ welcome!
[audience cheers]
Travis: Okay, but listen though—
Justin: Don’t applaud, enjoy the bare minimum please.
Travis: I do wanna say, I went from 131 hit points to 117 to 131, so I had a boo-boo and he fixed it.
Clint: And to be honest with you, I was really casting it on Taako to wake him up. And you kinda hijacked my move.
Justin: Ehhhh, fainting is not a wound.
Clint: Well—
Justin: I guess this is the time to talk about how I hadn’t lost any hit points. I was literally— the only damage that could have been done to me was the fall, and I was literally caught.
Travis: Yeah, if I caught him too hard, I guess? Oh, that’s 10 points of catching damage.
Clint: I am glad I cast it on Magnus, then.
Griffin: Davenport says,
Davenport: Anyways, we’re all here now with this pirate situation whether we like it or not, and speaking of, battle stations.
Griffin: And he points off the starboard side of the ship, and you all see the waters below start to part. And in the gap that forms, a shape emerges in the water. It’s a crow’s nest, followed by a tattered sail of translucent cloth, and then another sail, and a third, and then you see an entire boat rise from the waters and splash down 10 feet off the side of your ship. This vessel is made of rotted grey wood and covered in barnacles. And yet the whole vessel seems to be coated in this shimmering, sickly green light.
Travis: Yarrr, it’s Davy Jones!
Griffin: This boat also eclipses your own, it stands about 8 feet higher in the water, and it’s nearly twice as long as Davenport’s… Wavehumper. And over the railing of the side of the ship, you see a skeleton peek out and give you all a friendly wave, and a voice shouts:
Skeleton: Hello! My name’s Captain Callaway, and I’m so sorry for the inconvenience—
Magnus: Ahoy!
Captain Callaway: Ahoy, of course, where are my manners! Ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy, ahoy.
Merle: Harrr!
Taako: Ahoy, ahoy— no, I’m—
Justin: —asleep, sorry.
Captain Callaway: Uh, we’re going to need to take your ship and kill all of you, so we can dragoon you into our undead fleet, we’ll try to make it quick and painless, but it’s—
Magnus: Listen, I—
Captain Callaway: It’s hard to guarantee. It’d be actually really cool, honestly, if you could just drop anchor and wait to be murdered?
Magnus: Uhhh…
Clint: He is very nice.
Magnus: I will, I’ll tell you what, you seem very nice… you have one chance to surrender.
Captain Callaway: Oh, man.
Magnus: Listen, I know! Crossed purposes…
Justin: Is this the talking skeleton?
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: That’s so crazy. [Griffin and the audience laughs] It is if you think about it!
Travis: ‘Cuz where’s the air in the vocal cords—
Justin: Where’s the air in the vocal cords and stuff?
Clint: And is there, a tongue, like, how do you make your umlauts and stuff?
Justin: Right? Thank you.
Travis: Without the lips or the tongue, you just have the teeth.
Griffin: He chatters in a rhythm that makes the words… no…
Travis: Are you sure?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: ‘Cuz it’s our podcast.
Griffin: No… We’re actually doing our own podcast.
[Clint laughs in the background]
Justin: The Bone Zone.
Griffin: The Bone Zone. He turns to his crew and says,
Captain Callaway: They’re not just gonna let us murder ‘em. Looks like we have to… do a fight.
Griffin: Let’s roll for initiative with that… climactic—
Clint: Jim J. Bullock delivery! Wow. 19.
Griffin: Woah.
Travis: An 11.
Griffin: Uh, Taako, what’d you roll?
Justin: Um, I’m fainted.
Griffin: Go ahead and roll initiative, though, please.
Justin: Okay, I wake up.
Taako: (gasp) Scurvy vapors!
Clint: I was healing him from scurvy!
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: Don’t have scurvy, I have a 6 on that one.
Griffin: Uh-oh. That’s not very good—
Travis: You have a plus 3, so it’s a 9. Jesus!
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: The first thing that happens: a long plank of wood with spikes on the bottom of it raises up from the deck of the ghost pirate ship, and slams down into the deck of Davenport’s boat, the Wavehumper, uh, with a terrible crash, and 5 skeleton crew members come pouring down the gangplank onto your ship, and they all take a swing at Magnus, they act as a swarm, which means I roll as one sort of thing for them, that is a 19 versus AC?
Travis: That’s a miss.
Griffin: Oh that’s cool. You easily brush off five skeletons as they swing their scimitars at you— or their cutlasses, their cutli, at you, you carry them effortlessly, and they look very confused because the odds of that happening are just… wild! Next in the order is… Merle.
Clint: Uh, Merle casts Guiding Bolt.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: At… Gallaway?
Griffin: Callaway.
Clint: Callaway. Uh, the golfing pirate, so… That’s, um, that’s a sports reference.
Travis: No, I got it.
Clint: Okay, I didn't know. Uh, 4d6 radiant damage.
Travis: Well, you have to roll the hit first.
Griffin: Right.
Clint: 16.
Griffin: Uh, that’s a hit on Captain Callaway.
[audience cheers]
Clint: Thank you.
Griffin: Uh, just roll one—
Clint: Is that Father’s Day pity?
Griffin: What— uh, you got that d6 there?
Justin: Roll one.
Clint: I got a d6, okay… it’s— it’s kind of on a fold, maybe I oughta roll it again.
Travis: You said 2?
Clint: 2.
Travis: Four, four d6, is what you roll—
Griffin: Yep.
Travis: Roll those.
Clint: Okay— god these are heavy!
Travis: Yeah, they’re metal!
Griffin: Travis is gettin’ yolked over there!
Clint: God almighty!
Travis: He rolled three 1’s, and a 2.
Griffin: Holy shit.
Justin: Unbelievable.
Travis: Statistically, the second worst he could have done.
Griffin: Sure.
Clint: I suck at this game!
Griffin: It is radiant damage, though, so instead of just 5, it’s 10 points of damage.
Justin: Nice.
Clint: And I have advantage on my next attack roll.
Griffin: Oh, cool, okay. Uh, you're not gonna remember that, uh, and uh, your bolt emerges as you read from the Extreme Teen Bible, and it just kind of hits Captain Callaway, and he was like,
Captain Callaway: ...Okay… uh…
Griffin: Next in the order is… oh! You hear a mechanical sound coming from the ghost pirate ship, as a panel on the ghost pirate deck opens up, and from your position on Davenport’s boat, you see what looks like a hot air balloon start rising up from the ghost pirate ship, tethered to their ship with a long rope. And as it raises up 20 feet into the air, you see, attached to the bottom of this balloon, a ship’s cannon, which launches a big cannonball at the three of you, uh, roll a dexterity saving throw.
Clint: 12.
Justin: Takin’ a while. This one is a 22 for ‘cha boy Hoops.
[audience cheers]
Justin: Thank you, I did not play a large role in the outcome.
Travis: Uh, 16.
Griffin: And Merle, you rolled a… 12? Alright. Magnus and Taako, you both dive out of the way with grace and ease.
Travis: I rolled twice because I have the tooth necklace.
Griffin: Merle, you are struck with a cannonball.
Justin: I pictured it like, the three of us are standing in a row, it goes Magnus, Taako, Merle?
Griffin: Yeah. Uh, it actually lands at your feet, hitting you with a fiery explosion and splinters of wood that come up from the deck of Davenport’s ship for 24 points of damage.
Clint: Jeez.
Travis: Hey, you cool?
Griffin: Yeah, it’s a fuckin’ cannon guys, c’mon! Uh, next in the order is… Magnus.
Travis: Um… well, how close is the ghost ship to our ship?
Griffin: 10 feet away, you have a gangplank also.
Travis: I’m gonna jump to it.
Griffin: You got a gangplank, and— okay.
Travis: But there’s 5 shellingtons in the way!
Griffin: Sure… There’s a— hey, hey, hey! There’s probably a rope you could swing on!
[Audience cheers]
Travis: I do that. Okay, uhh, that’s a 17.
Griffin: You swing and it’s cool.
Travis: And I land right next to Callaway.
Griffin: Sure!
Travis: And I attack him.
Griffin: How many times?
Travis: Six. No, no, right now, just the three. No, wait, just two.
Griffin: Okay. Uh, what are you attacking him with?
Travis: The Flaming, Raging, Poisoning Sword of Doom.
Griffin: Fuck.
Travis: That’s a 7. Oh, sorry, 17.
Griffin: [defeated] Yeah. Shit. One of these liveshows, I’m gonna make a demon take it, or something.
Justin: I think a demon would only be temporary—
Travis: Well, I only rolled a 2, so that’s only 26 points of damage.
Clint: We played the Stream of Many Eyes game, and Travis played, and when it finally got to his turn, he took one battle turn that they literally turned and said “What does your character do?”, and 20 minutes later, when he wrapped up his turn, they were all gaping at him.
Travis: And I rolled a 24 attack.
Griffin: Yeah, of course!
Travis: And a 27 damage. So that’s 53 total.
Clint: Wait a minute, he may not be done.
Griffin: A lot uh, a lot of his bones come off. Just a lot of—
Clint: He’s de-boned.
Griffin: A lot of discarded bones on the ground.
Travis: And then with my third attack—
Griffin: Shit-birds.
Clint: I told ya! I told ya!
Travis: I’m gonna throw the Chance Lance at the cannon operator? Or the cannon?
Griffin: It’s just a balloon, it’s floating in the air.
Travis: I pop the balloon.
Griffin: Okay. There’s no operator, as far as you can see.
Justin: [quietly] Magic.
Travis: That’s a 19?
Griffin: Yep.
Travis: So… okay, I guess the balloon will… take some damage? Um, 12 damage—
Griffin: It pops, it’s a balloon. It pops.
Travis: That’s why I was confused.
Clint: You have solved his balloon mystery.
Griffin: The balloon pops, and the cannon falls and plunges into the deck of the ship, and it keeps on going, and you hear it hitting a lot of wood, just sort of— it sounds like it’s maybe going to the mantle of the earth that you’re standing on. You also hear it hit water as it falls.
Travis: I just imagine Callaway and I standing there like, “Ooh. Oof. Ooh. Oh.”
Griffin: With his four remaining bones. Uh, next in the order is Orla, who takes her cutlass and engages with the uh, swarm of skeletons. And she engages with one in particular and there’s a cool duel, and she cuts off its head. As it falls to the ground, there are now four remaining skeletons on the ship. Next in the order is Taako.
Justin: Um, I hide behind the edge of our ship.
Griffin: ‘Kay.
Justin: And I chew a piece of Mockingbird Gum. And I impersonate Captain Callaway as I call out,
Taako (as Capt. Callaway): We’re beaten, boys, it's time to get out of here!
Griffin: The four remaining skeletons look around like,
Four Skeletons: Well, where do you want us to go?
Taako (as Capt. Callaway): Everyone in the water!
[The crowd laughs and applauds]
Travis: Your move, Griffin!
Griffin: Make a check, you’re gonna need to check for this one.
Justin: I got the gum. But I have the gum.
Griffin: It’s good gum, you’ll have advantage on it. What’s the— I always fuckin’ fuck this up— deception, make a deception check for me.
Justin: That’s a— that one’s a 2 on that—
Griffin: So, you have advantage.
Justin: Not good. And a 10. So, it sounds more like this,
Taako (as a Southerner): Hey everybody! Hey! Let’s all jump in the water! Come on! Come on!
Griffin: Yeah, they do it.
Justin: I mean, they’re dumb skeletons!
Griffin: Sure. They all just jump right in. They gather up the bones of the defeated skeleton brethren and all five of them jump into the water between the two ships. The ghost pirate ship is now sinking into the water as the cannon sort of pierced through it
Justin: So in a sense, it was the most humane thing I could do in this scenario! They were, in fact beaten, and they should, in fact, retreat.
Griffin: The water is almost up the deck of the ship, Magnus, where you and Callaway are standing, and Callaway says,
Captain Callaway: Well, uh, I can see that I’m beaten. Boy, that didn’t… take very long.
Griffin: And he takes a step towards the mast. And on the mast there is a bell, which he grabs the ringer for and rings the bell, which is what you do… with a bell. And it makes a sickening, low noise, much lower than the size of the bell… would… make you think it would make— fuck me!
Justin: Tell me more about the bell. [audience laughs] Let’s not rush.
Clint: Can you like, recreate it for us?
Travis: Yeah, like I—
Griffin: Sure sure—
Travis: I figured it would make a “ding ding ding!”
Clint: No, I think it would be more resonant.
Griffin: It’d be like… “dong-a-long-a-long”.
Justin: Right on.
Griffin: Uh, the sound rings out into the distance, and continues until it is consumed by the waters. Magnus, you are just kind of, in the water now as the ghost ship sinks below, taking Captain Callaway and the rest of the crew down with it.
Travis: I grappling-hook up to the ship.
Clint: Wait I have a— I have a spell!
Griffin: Hold on, wait, he grappling-hooks up to the ship. There’s a second act. And the sound of this bell is continuing in the air, even though the ghost ship is consumed, and suddenly, the waters behind your ship part once more. And another ghostly vessel rises from the water, and then two more behind it in formation. And then, three more behind it. Within moments, an entire fleet of ghost ships, dozens of them, are pursuing your boat, all crewed by dozens of cackling skeletons, thrilled at the opportunity to engage in some good old-fashioned piracy. Amidst their laughter, you hear a strange sound come from close by. Here’s another sound effect for you Dad. It sounds like: “Caw! Caw!”. Perched on the railing of Davenport’s ship is a raven, a bird not historically known for oceanic expeditions. And then a second raven lands immediately adjacent to the first and joins in the chorus. Then we see a shadow cast over your faces as hundreds of ravens appear, which, uh, fly immediately down, down towards your ship, crashing into the deck of the Wavehumper. And as the ravens fly off, three robed, familiar figures appear in front of you. [The crowd goes wild] The one in the center pulls out a scroll and begins reading. It says,
Kravitz: [in a Cockney accent] Undead abominations! By decree of the Raven Queen, we formally charge your fleet w— [drops accent] Taako? What are you doing here, babe?
Griffin: That’s the end of Act 1! We’ll be back with more!
(Intermission)
[[Music fade-in at 50:01-50:11]]
Griffin: Alright. Kravitz, Lup, and Barry are standing in front of you at the bow of—
[crowd cheering]
Clint: Oh, okay! Okay.
Griffin: [laughing] You spent that entire intermission like—
Clint: I was sitting there— I was on my phone saying “Oh god, crows, and why… Adventure Zone…”
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ravens.
Clint: Oh, ravens, that’s why I couldn’t find ‘em.
Griffin: The three— The three of them are standing in front of you at the bow of Davenport’s ship, dressed in their full Raven Queen regalia. As the three of them realise the situation, Kravitz drops his skeletal facade, and the three of them rush towards your party. Kravitz gives you a warm embrace, Taako, and says,
Kravitz: No, no, seriously, Taako, what are you doing here?
Taako: Babe, I told you I was having a boys weekend. I put it on my G-Cal, you know I did!
Kravitz: I thought that meant, like, you’d go out to, you know, Reno, and play the tables, I didn’t think…
Magnus: We’re doing that after!
Clint: So is Reno canon now?
Griffin: It’s Reno…
Travis: Renowinter!
Griffin: ...Yes.
Griffin: Uh, Lup says,
Lup: So, uh, Davenport, bud, kinda curious why you’d, uh, decided to come back out here after you wrote us about all the ghost-based dangers you encountered, my man, didn’t you consider that we’d be coming to collect for, you know, the goddess of death?
Griffin: And, uh, Davenport says,
Davenport: I’ll be honest, I kinda forgot? That y’all were… doing that these days? I’ve been on the sea, you see, the ocean makes you forget things.
Griffin: And Barry says,
Barry: Well, no worries, we’ll take it from here. You all just head back home, we’ll clean up, and uh, meet you back at Westbreak for a celebratory round of drinks, shouldn’t take us more than five minutes.
Taako: Yeah, any help you wanna provide would be absolutely astounding, thank you.
Magnus: Yeah, we’d like to— I mean, we’re— Can I be honest? Hey?
Griffin: Barry says,
Barry: Y-yeah?
Magnus: Since that whole thing where, like, we saved not only this universe but all universes?
Clint: Spoiler alert.
Magnus: Yeah. I’ve been bored. Could we stay and fight the skellingtons please?
Griffin: Lup and Barry start hovering off the deck of the ship, uh, in this cloud of black smoke, and, addressing you, Magnus, as they soar off, Lup says,
Lup: You’ll just get in the waaayyyyyy! [voice trailing off]
Griffin: And Kravitz says,
Kravitz: Seriously, five minutes, we’ll be right back.
Griffin: And he takes off in a cloud of smoke also.
Taako: [voice also trailing off] Okay, who’s feeding the caaaaats?
[laughter]
Griffin: He—
Travis: I just pictured skellington cats.
Griffin: He yells,
Kravitz: Susan!
Taako: I hate Susan, you know that!
Kravitz: [voice trailing off] You don’t have to like her for her to feed the caaaaats!
Taako: Okay. But don’t binge Queer Eye season 2 without me, it came out today!
Kravitz: [crosstalk, voice continues to get drawn out as he gets higher in the sky] Too laaaate!
Taako: Noooooo!
Griffin: Uh, from behind you Orla clears her throat. She says,
Orla: Your friends seem, very capable. But taking down this fleet? It’s, uh, a futile effort. They’ll— these aren’t like the undead you’ve faced before, they’re not the defiled husks of fallen adventurers lying in wait in some dungeon, they were— they were turned. They were made that way by something that lurks fathoms beneath us this very moment. It’s the same thing that destroyed my ship and killed my crew. It’s an elder god called The Kraken.
Griffin: And, in one swift movement, she draws her cutlass and drags it against her palm and flicks a few drops of blood over the side of the boat.
Magnus: [crosstalk] Ew!
Griffin: Storm clouds gather from every direction as a peal of thunder matches the sound of ghost ships exploding in the melee behind you. Waves rise up from the waters in an instant like goosebumps appearing on flesh. The boat lurches to the side and Davenport springs up the stairs towards the wheel, attempting to keep the boat level. Orla removes the cannon from her back and kneels, refilling a chamber with black powder from a flask on her hip and says,
Orla: We have mere moments to prepare, you should spend them wisely.
Magnus: Why didn’t you say that before? Why didn’t you be like, “Hey, I’m about to do a thing, do you need time?”
Griffin: She said— she says, uh,
Orla: If you knew what was coming, you would’ve turned and ran—
Magnus: To where? We’re on a boat!
[audience laughs]
Merle: [incredulously] The back of the boat?
Clint: Which is the...
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Ugh, don’t, please, Christ.
[laughter and crosstalk]
Justin: I can’t. I am going to cast Water Breathing on our entire crew.
Griffin: Okay.
Justin: Just a little insurance.
Griffin: Do you tell people you’re doing that?
Justin: No, it’ll be a fun surprise.
Griffin: You all feel gills appear on your neck.
Travis: Huh.
Griffin: Two massive tentacles splash upward from the starboard side of the boat. One teeters towards the boat and wraps itself around the mast at the center of the ship just a few feet away. Two more spring upward from the port side, one entwining the figurehead on the prow. From beneath the pitch-black waters, now slapping at the bottom of your boat below, you hear an otherworldly howl. And…
Travis: Are we to assume this is the Kraken?
Griffin: [sarcastically] No, this is… some other big octopus. You have four tentacles, two of which are entwining your boat. We’re back up to the top of the order with Merle.
Clint: That’s only really half an octopus.
Travis: The other four are doing other things.
Clint: Oh, okay! ‘Cause, I mean, a four-legged octopus is… a horse.
Justin: [laughs] Stupid, stupid thing to say. What a dumb joke.
Clint: Is it— is it stupid?
Travis: Well, no one’s ever looked at a horse and said, “That’s like half an octopus!”
Justin: Okay, but if you put two horses and glued them together—
Travis: Yeah, no, I get it, but!
[crosstalk]
Griffin: It would kinda look like an octopus, sure.
Clint: Sometimes I’m just too deep.
Justin: Dumb, stupid— stupid podcast.
Griffin: Merle... Merle, you’re up. You’ve got one tentacle entwined in the mast, one on the figurehead, and two more floating in the ocean, one to the starboard side and one to the port. What do you do?
Clint: Um, Merle casts Water Walk!
Griffin: What’s—
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Seems a bit sacrilegious to give that one to a cleric, but go ahead and hit me.
Clint: This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface, such as water, as if it were harmless, solid ground. Uh, yeah. Up to— oh, okay! We can all do— oh, we can all walk on water! We all walk on water.
Griffin: Alright, sure! Fuck it! That is your turn, next in the order is Magnus.
Clint: But can’t we describe it at least, how cool it looks?
Justin: We’re still on the boat! [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] I mean, you’re still on a boat right now, so—
Clint: Oh, but it’ll get there, right?
Griffin: [laughs]
Clint: Yeah! Be ready. As soon as we start walking on water, you know who did it.
Griffin: It’s not gonna happen. Magnus, you’re up.
Travis: I attack the tentacle?
Clint: By walking over to it?
[crosstalk]
Griffin: On the boat’s surface. You’ve got one on the mast, one on the figurehead, and two floating in the water. Which one do you attack?
Clint: [strained] I’d attack the one in the water.
Travis: I’m gonna attack the one on the mast because it seems like the easiest one to reach.
Griffin: Yep, sure. Go for it. I’m gonna guess it’s, what, the broken one of them—
Travis: Uh, 15?
Griffin: Oh, no! You didn’t hit it.
Travis: What about a 26?
Griffin: Yeah. I mean, you’re gonna add 20 fuckin’ damage to it—
Travis: 29.
Griffin: Yeah. Uh, you cleave right through it with the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom. A spurt of gross, green fluid comes flying out of the severed tentacle as it falls to the deck of the ship, and the rest of the tentacle retreats. There are now three tentacles remaining.
Travis: Now, Griffin, I know you’re the DM and I don’t normally challenge your authority. When the tentacle, a tentacle, was wrapped around the mast, how did I miss it with a 15?
Griffin: It was too strong. Your attack bounced off like a child, like a child swinging a wiffle ball bat at a flagpole, like a weak fucking child.
[cheers]
Travis: Fair play.
Griffin: Is that it?
Travis: Yep.
Griffin: Oh, shit! Uh, next in the order is the octopus. The two tentacles that are floating free— one of them is going to try to slam down on Merle. It was confused by the spell that he cast. It was afraid of how powerful it was. It rears up into the air and comes down— that’s just a 15 versus AC?
Clint: Yeah.
Travis: No, that’s a miss.
Clint: That’s a miss.
Griffin: Yeah, it comes down on you and you hold up your bible and deflect it in the air.
Clint: Okay! Can I open it?
Griffin: Sure, yes.
Clint: Ahhh… beautiful.
[cheers]
Clint: These are available out in the lobby!
Justin: They’re not!
Clint: They’re not?
Justin & Griffin: No.
Clint: Uh, this is only mine.
Griffin: The other one— uh, the other one swings down and tries to grab Magnus. That is a 21 versus AC?
Travis: Where’s the tie— what’s a tie?
Griffin: Tie goes to the attacker.
Travis: Fuck.
Griffin: You are grappled. It crushes you in its grasp. Oh, that’s not bad, it’s 11 points of damage. But you are grappled—
Travis: I sneeze.
Griffin: But you are grappled in this tentacle’s grasp and lifted up above the deck of the ship. Next in the order is Taako.
Justin: First thing’s first, I dig into my bag as a free action and pull out the Cloak of the Manta Ray.
[cheers]
Griffin: It’s covered in cobwebs!
Justin: Yeah. That allows me the ability to breathe underwater. Little bit of…
Griffin: A lot of sort of water-based buffing happening so far.
Justin: Redundancy…
Travis: We’re just so excited to finally have the chance to use them!
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: I can also swim at 60 feet per second, so—
Griffin: Oh, beautiful, okay.
Justin: But I’m not gonna do that right now. Right now, I’m going to cast, on the dumb squid who is not the Kraken— is that what we established, is that canonical? Or this is the Kraken?
Travis: It is, it is the Kraken.
Justin: You said it was another big squid, so—
Clint: And a squid— [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] I was being a jackass, it’s the Kraken!
Justin: Well then, on the Kraken, I’m going to cast Otto’s Irresistible Dance.
[cheers]
Griffin: This spell is fucking broken!
Justin: I’m gonna cast that on a creature I can see within range. It will begin a comic dance in place. Shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering! [Clint laughs] For the duration of a minute, it has to use all its movement to dance, and it cannot leave its space and has disadvantage on dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by the spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it as it dances. As an action, the dancing creature may make a wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself, and on a successful save, the spell ends.
Griffin: Do you have to attack me, or do I roll to resist it at first—
Justin: It is a, what, uhh… I think it’s a… nope!
Griffin: Oh, shit, okay!
Justin: It work— it just worked!
Griffin: The remaining tentacle that’s wrapped around the prow of the ship just unspools, and then… fuck, man.
Justin: [smug] Yeah.
Travis: I hate to ask to introduce the idea, but… is one of the tentacles that’s holding Magnus dancin’ around holding Magnus?
Griffin: Yeah.
Magnus: Aaauahah!
Taako: Win some, lose some.
Griffin: All three of the remaining tentacles including the one holding Magnus reach up into the air and start doing… the electric slide?
Clint: It’s electric!
Griffin: Yeah, so they just start sliding back and forth in the water sort of rhythmically. Magnus, you’re getting whipped around, back and forth. It’s a violent dance. Uh, but the ship has become ungrappled entirely, and you realize that it’s good that that is the case because it was slowing down significantly and the remaining ghost ships behind you were starting to catch up. But now, you are not in danger of the ships behind you catching up. We are back to the top of the order. Merle, what’s up?
Clint: Merle casts Control Water.
Griffin: A little unnecessary!
Clint: Oh, is it?
Griffin: No, Travis giving me the bird. [Clint: Oh.] As if he was—
Clint: Lemme see it again, wait wait!
Travis: No no no!
[crosstalk]
Griffin: I think Travis even now realizes it was uncalled for.
Travis: It was a real older brother, not cooperative podcaster, move.
Griffin: What does Control Water… do?
Clint: Merle… [sputters] Gee whiz, it makes spaghetti. What do you think Control Water does?
Griffin: [laughs] What’s the fuckin’ card say?
Clint: Hoist on your own petard, pal!
Justin: Until the spell ends, you control any free-standing water inside of an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. You can flood, which causes the water—
Griffin: Please don’t read every— there’s eight paragraphs of spell [Justin: —to rise.] description.
Justin: There’s— you can part the water. You can redirect the flow. You can make a whirlpool. You— you said you were doing that one.
Clint: Yeah.
Justin: It requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. I think we got that.
Griffin: That’s the ocean.
Justin: You cause a whirlpool to form. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is five feet wide at the base. Up to five— 50 feet— five feet wide at the base? I’m not even sure that would— they would notice.
[crosstalk]
Griffin: This is great fuckin’ audio.
Clint: This is gonna kill him, though, this’ll kill it!
Justin: This is what you rule people want, right? You want me to read all the rules. [audience cheers] Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet towards it. [Griffin: Good.] The creature can swim away from the vortex by making a strength— athletics check against your spell save DC.
Clint: ™ Wizards of the Coast.
Griffin: So, you’ve created a whirlpool.
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Alright.
[Clint and audience chuckle]
Clint: Give him the finger again, Trav!
Griffin: Yeah. [Travis: No.] You’re— you’re on a fucking boat!
[cheers]
Clint: But! I can walk on waaater.
Griffin: Alright, we’re doing this. [Clint laughs maniacally] The waves beneath you, they move in a peculiar motion. Maybe the other, the rest of you don’t quite understand what’s going on as a whirlpool suddenly forms right beneath the ship and octopus and all of it. And now, you cannot only see the three tentacles that were above the water, you see all seven of them remaining. And in the center, at the bottom of this whirlpool, being crushed by the water— go ahead and roll 2d8 bludgeoning damage for me. It’s the eight-sided die, let’s go ahead and hurt this octopus.
Clint: Seven… six… [Griffin: Alright.] Plus… something?
Griffin: No, I don’t think so.
Clint: Okay.
Justin: [laughs]
Griffin: You see the body of the Kraken. It is… enormous. It is larger than your ship with sickly pink skin, two beady glowing orange eyes, and a beak that is shrieking towards the heavens as this whirlpool forms around it, crushing it. There are now seven tentacles and your ship sees— everybody on your ship sees this— sorry, I’m trying to figure this out in real time. Everyone aboard your ship sees the body of this Kraken as it looks over the edge of this whirlpool on the ship, and then you don’t really need to look over the edge anymore as the ship is then also pulled into the whirlpool, and you hear Daven go,
Davenport: What the fuuuuck?
as he jerks the wheel to the side, trying to keep the yacht afloat. You are close to the top of the 50-foot rim of this whirlpool, going down. Uh, let’s see what the fuck else happens. I think as it is crushed, it drops you, Magnus, back down onto the boat. There are now seven tentacles just kinda all over, so please don’t ask me which tentacle you’re attacking at any given time, they are identical. And we’re back up—
Clint: They’re identical tentacles?
[cheers]
Griffin: Magnus, you are now up.
Travis: I am going to take control of the ship wheel and steer the shit out of it. No? I am not going to do—
Griffin: No, you can do that, it’s just Davenport’s gonna be like,
Davenport: [disappointed] Oh, yeah alright.
Griffin: Daven— Davenport—
Justin(?): He didn’t have money troubles before—
Griffin: Davenport says, uh,
Davenport: I know about your proficiencies, it’s just I’m the captain, and it feels like, um…
Magnus: Well, you can command— listen, you can be captain and not steer.
Davenport: You wanna do tradesies? Can I hold onto the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom?
Magnus: Nooo!
Griffin: He says,
Davenport: That’s the only way I’ll do it! I’ll let you steer the ship, you gotta give me the Sword of Doom for a little bit.
Magnus: Okay. On one condition—
Taako: It’s— it’s technically mine.
Magnus: If you lose it—
Taako: It’s my sword.
Magnus: —you die forever.
Taako: Well, it’s kinda my sword, so it’s more up to me. It’s fine, go ahead.
Griffin: He says,
Davenport: Yeah, I can live with that. It’s a big responsibility.
and he is now wielding the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom. [audience cheers] That’s a… roll initiative for Davenport!
Travis: Nope.
Griffin: This is gonna be weird.
Clint: Aw, really?
Griffin: Alright, you’re steering the ship. What’s up now?
Travis: I rolled a… 14 plus four, 18.
Griffin: A— what?
Travis: To steer the ship.
Griffin: Yeah. You’re steerin’ it…
Travis: Real good. [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Steerin’ it real good.
Travis: I’m trying to keep from getting pulled into the whirlpool that Merle created.
Griffin: Uh, yeah no, you definitely have—
Travis: Oh, I know what I’m doing!
Griffin: Yeah?
Magnus: Orla! I’m gonna bring the cannons alongside!
Griffin: She gives you just a thumbs up and lights a cigar because it’s about to get righteous. Uh, and she takes her cannon that she has strapped to her back and places it into position next to a few others and starts loading them up with cannonballs. Uhhh, let’s just do that now so we have some resolution to this action. She just runs down with a lighter that she has lit, just tss-tss-tss-tss and fires into the crowd of tentacles. She blasts with four cannonballs outward, only three collide with tentacles and they explode, leaving four remaining, getting us back on track for the fight so you guys aren’t fighting eight things at the same time. Okay, next in the order is Taako.
Justin: Yeah. Mm, so, you know what, we’ve come a long way, why don’t you describe the situation to me so we all know what we’re—
Griffin: [crosstalk] There’s four tentacles remaining. Your ship is trapped in a whirlpool, at the bottom of which is the body of the Kraken which is looking at you and howling with a gross beak.
Travis: And with the steering, it’s kind of going around—
Justin: And there’s tentacles in the water?
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Okay. And there’s a whirlpool.
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Oh my God.
Griffin: No, yeah, it’s gotten… hairy.
Justin: I grab… [Griffin: Yeah.] I grab the plank that the other ship used to attack us with the spikes on it. I pick it up and I stand on the edge of the boat and say,
Taako: You don’t know me. My name is Taako and I invented surfing!
[audience cheers]
Justin: And I leap… I leap off the boat on my spiked surfboard towards the remaining tentacles in the water.
Griffin: Alright. I think on your rad trajectory being pushed forward— it’s like one of those like surfing pools where the water’s like shooting at you super fast, so you are able to just like, fuckin’ carve it, bro.
Justin: Yeah, bro.
Griffin: You are able to get some good speed going.
Justin: Yes, bro.
Griffin: That’s just your movement. What’s your— what’s your action, now?
Justin: Oh, golly! [Clint laughs] Kinda thought that I— that would’ve done it, you know what I mean? Kinda thought that I—
Travis: I do like that your idea was not in any way to stop the Kraken, but no, I just wanted to carve! [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] The spikes! I was planning on carving over the legs with my spikes.
Griffin: Oh, sick! Okay. [Justin: Yeah!] Make a… just make a basic attack roll, adding…
Justin: [laughs] It’s a natural 20!
Griffin: Fuck. [audience cheers] Uh, you’re gonna kill one of the tentacles, but why don’t you describe what that looks like.
Justin: Taako leaps off and— the spike thing— and he grabs the edge of it and he kinda bends it up, just sort of a stylish maneuver, it’s not necessary, and then he brings it back down and he just carves right up the tentacle and like, carves off of it, does a 900 off of it, [Clint: Ooh!] and he just shreds it right in half. It’s really gnarly. Perhaps tubular.
Griffin: Uh, okay! Yeah. It explodes and it’s totally sick.
Justin: Indeed, indeed.
Griffin: Orla from the deck of the ship says,
Orla: Who the fuck are you guys?
Next in the order is the octopus. Two of the tentacles— hm, let’s think. One of the tentacles comes crashing down— I’ll give you each one. Merle, one tries to slam down on you again. That’s a two, so that’s not gonna work. Another one comes crashing down towards Mag— where are you at, Magnus, are you still even on the fuckin’ boat?
Travis: Yeah, I’m steering.
Griffin: Oh, that’s right. 18 versus AC?
Travis: Miss!
Griffin: Mkay. I don’t know how that happened, you’re steering a boat, not a hard target.
Travis: Well I’m wearing a giant-slayer’s ring and I’m wearing armor, and I just gotta go, “Ohh!”
Griffin: The third one is gonna take a swipe and try to grapple Taako as he surfs down the water, and that is a 19 versus AC.
Justin: Indeed.
Griffin: You are grabbed. Do you hold onto your skate— your surfboard as you are lifted up into the air?
Justin: [quiet] I think I do.
Griffin: Mkay. Make a strength contest with this tentacle.
Justin: This should go good. Uh, 13 plus, what’s my strength? Zilch.
Griffin: I got a 16. You see the beak of the Kraken open wide as this tentacle starts to move downward back into its awaiting maw. It looks so ready for this. It looks real hongry. And as you are just inches away, you see a black cloud of smoke fly through the tentacle [Travis laughs] and it explodes. And you see Kravitz now in his reaper form, full skeletal face with his scythe dripping with green ooze as he severs the tentacle, and it spasms and flings you back up into the air, and he catches your hand in his [audience cheers] and gently kind of puts you back down, like,
Kravitz: Do you want me to put you back surfing? Or were you… where do you need to go right now?
Taako: For— question one, did you see the thing with the surfboard?
Kravitz: It was rad, yeah.
Taako: Thank you, yes!
Kravitz: Very good.
Taako: The boat is fine, I had my moment.
Griffin: He says,
Kravitz: You got it.
and takes you back up to the boat, and you hear Lup in the distance like,
Lup: Hey, hurry it up! There’s still like eight more boats back here.
Taako: Fuck.
Kravitz: Yeah, no, it’s— it’s not going good back there, either, but you all have this octopus situation taken care of? Have you tried using diplomacy?
[Clint laughs] And he flies back off. Next in the order, we’re back up to Merle.
Clint: Merle casts Bane on the three remaining tentacles.
Griffin: What’s that do?
Clint: Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make charisma saving throws.
Travis: How charming are these tentacles?
Clint: Whenever a target that—
Griffin: Depends on who you ask.
Clint: I’m banking on it not being—
[Travis laughs and audience cheers]
Griffin: It’s not— no, no, no. It’s not… it’s not my thing, I’m just saying, making an observation.
Clint: The target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
Travis: What?
Clint: I don’t know.
Griffin: This is going to—
Clint: Alright, so you have to make— the three tentacles have to make charisma saving throws! Do you not know this game?
Griffin: I got a seven for the tentacles, so they don’t save, and now every time they attack they roll a d4 and subtract it. Alright, well, lemme get a d4 out, didn’t think I was gonna be using one of these little guys. [dice clattering] Alright, I got one. [Clint: ‘Kay.] Okay! Good stuff. Next in the order is Magnus.
Travis: Alright.
Griffin: Oh, no, I’m sorry, I forgot to roll for Davenport. [weak chuckle] You— the ship is now sailing almost next to, right up against one of the remaining tentacles. We’ll say two remaining tentacles because that clock is almost out of time. As you carve a path with the ship, Davenport holds onto some netting on the side of the boat, and, taking the Flaming Raging Poisoning Sword of Doom in his hand, he says,
Davenport: This thing’s super heavy! You could’ve given me a heads up!
And as he says that, just kind of holding it out, right, it just very slowly like, bloooop, cuts through one, and then bloooop, cuts through the other, and he says,
Davenport: Wow! This thing’s… way too powerful! It’s… I didn’t even swing it, I just kinda held it out and then the things just died as soon as it touched this utterly broken fuckin’ item. It feels like God shouldn’t allow something like this to exist in our universe! And you use this all the time!
Magnus: It’s my main!
Davenport: That’s pretty wild, it’s just—
Magnus: I know!
and then bloooop, he cuts through the third one, like,
Davenport: Oh shit, I didn’t even— I wasn’t even paying attention that time!
Clint: Wouldn’t it be funny if Davenport dropped it? [Travis: No!] And you lost it forever?
Travis: Then Davenport would be dead forever. [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] And you see Davenport’s hand as it hits the third one open, and it faaalls. [Clint laughs] But then he reaches down real fast and catches it and is like,
Davenport: Wow, that was pretty close, huh?
And then a big bird flies down and grabs it from his— but then he grabs it back like,
Davenport: Ohhh!
Clint: [laughs] He’s gonna cry.
Travis: I am not. [Griffin: Next—] But I would and it’s not— there’s nothing wrong with crying.
Clint: And technically it’s Taako’s.
Justin: Technically it’s my sword.
Griffin: Next in the order is Magnus. What do you do?
Justin: Taako calls out,
Taako: Don’t kill it, I have a plan.
Griffin: Yeah, we can cop out of initiative.
Travis: Okay—
Justin: Perfect!
Griffin: Do you have a— who has plans? Let’s take a vote on plans.
Travis: I’m just gonna steer out of the whirlpool.
Taako: Perfect!
Griffin: Okay, it’s… sucking you down.
Travis: [muttered] Yeah, but I’m really good at driving. Ooh, but I have proficiency. Oh, that’s better!
Griffin: Okay. You stay afloat in the whirlpool, start, uh, going back up to the top. Taako, what’s your plan?
Justin: I cast Dominate Monster on the Kraken.
Griffin: Fuck. There’s a spell for everything.
Justin: Eighth— it’s eighth level, I only have one and I’m using it on this. Cast Dominate Monster on the Kraken. [Griffin: Okay.] It’s gotta succeed on a wisdom saving throw.
Griffin: It’s— it won’t.
Justin: Well, go ahead and roll.
Griffin: Uh, 13?
Justin: No, sir.
Griffin: ‘Kay. It failed.
Justin: So now it works for me. [audience cheers] And I… leap into the water, swim to it with extremely fast speed thanks to my radical cloak. [more cheers]
Griffin: You jump out of the boat, actually, and as you hit the water, you just collide with it [Travis: Yeah!] because of the spell that Merle cast. You— you cheer, “Hooray, my wonderful cl—” bonk, you collide with the water and just kind of crumple down the whirlpool—
Justin: I stand up—
Griffin: Towards your new pet.
Justin: I stand up, I dust myself off, and I say,
Taako: C’mon, we’re gonna go save my boyfriend!
And I point it towards— I point it towards the remaining ghost ships. Me and my legless Kraken [Clint: Ah!] are coming to the rescue!
Clint: But not for long!
Justin: Okay?
Clint: Merle casts Regenerate on the Kraken.
[crowd goes wild]
Justin: Yes! Yes!
Clint: Where a target’s severed body members are restored!
[everyone goes wild]
Griffin: You all have lost so many body parts during—
Travis: So Merle— Merle uses his tree arm to cast Regenerate [Griffin: Sure!] on a Kraken he just met—
Griffin: No, his tree arm is way more rad than his flesh arm. You befriend this Kraken that you sort of slide down the whirlpool towards, and as you Dominate it, it says,
Kraken: [unintelligible gurgling noises]
And you hop on its back and it kind of starts trying to flop up the side of the whirlpool [Clint: Aww.] but it’s having trouble, but then you see a beam of light from the Extreme Teen Bible—
Clint: Well, he’s runnin’ along the water, Merle is, ‘cause he can walk on water.
Griffin: Yeah, let’s get everyone in the water.
Clint: Yeah, he’s walkin’ on water and runnin’ towards it and holds it up and yells out the spell.
Griffin: And suddenly, all eight tentacles return to the Kraken, and it nods at you Neverending Story-wise. Does it pick up— I’m asking Taako this— does it pick up Merle also as it flies out of the whirlpool?
Taako: No need for that, he can walk on water!
[laughter and cheers]
Griffin: We— there are— there’s one main ghost ship remaining. It is a dreadnought, the biggest ship of the fleet, crewed by dozens of skeletons alone in this one, and you see Barry, Lup, and Kravitz having a dang hard time taking it down. There’s some big burly skeletons on this one, probably a couple— two mummies? Oh, no!
Clint: Aw, mummies?
Travis: Aw, the worst!
Griffin: Uh, and they are surrounded on the center of the boat, and then in the distance, they hear, [deep] “splash, splash, splash,” and they turn and look behind them and see the shape of the Kraken coming towards them with a figure silhouetted from behind by the sunset behind him flying towards the ship, and right before the Kraken collides with the ship, Barry says,
Barry: What the hell is that?
[outro music begins]
And Kravitz says,
Kravitz: That’s the best damn pirate I’ve ever seen.
[audience cheers]
That’s the end of the episode! Thank you all so much for joining us!

Griffin: Let’s hop right into it! Are you guys ready?
[The three respond simultaneously, a enthusiastic “hell yes!” from Justin, “yeah!” from Travis, a hesitant “yeah?” from Clint.]
Griffin: Um, so the three of you--Merle, Magnus, and Taako--have joined the Bureau of Balance for a weekend-long mandatory corporate team-building retreat [pause as audience laughs] at a woodland complex called Camp Good Friend, tucked away in an idyllic few acres of the Trollbark Forest. The event was organized by the Director of the Bureau of Balance, who began to notice a slight resentment between the different teams of the Bureau of Balance, uh, uh--
Travis: Jealousy.
Griffin: A little bit of jealousy in between the ranks. And in order to squash that, she has sort of brought the whole organization onto--wow you guys are really genuinely far away--uh, to, to Camp Good Friend! Uh, and it’s day three of your retreat, first two were filled with the types of activities you’d expect: Seminars on effective corporate communication, panels led by HR representatives on workplace etiquette, some--some bonfires with musical accompaniment led by Johann the Bard, and Camp Good Friend has been fine, the three of you have your own private bunk away from the--some of the bigger cabins--but you’re still kind of roughing it.
Travis: Tell us more about the bunk, Griffin.
Griffin: Well, why don’t you tell me about what you’ve been doing at Camp Good Friend, what sorts of activities you’ve been participating in.
Clint: Lanyards! We did a lot of lanyards.
Griffin [laughing]: OK.
Clint: Those’re--those’re hot right now.
Griffin: OK.
Travis: I did a lot of Fantasy Skeet Shooting. With arrows.
Griffin: Would that even work?
Travis: It was very hard.
Griffin: Yeah!
Travis: It did not go well! It went poorly!
Griffin: Taako?
Justin: I slept in a lot and blew off as many activities as I possibly could.
Griffin [laughing]: OK! ...A nugget of truth there!
[Clint laughs.]
Griffin: But it’s the final day of--of your stay at Camp Good Friend, during which everybody is supposed to participate in something called the Trial of Teamwork, which the event’s organizers and counselors have promised to be a completely transformative experience which will change your lives and allow you to relate to your fellow human--or elf or dwarf or whatever--in ways that you’ve never imagined.
And you’re summoned to the Enclave of Cooperation, a large clearing in the forest with a stone circle of benches, and just past that is a hilltop dungeon with an archway entrance with a big heavy gate over it.
Travis: Now, does this--does this seem like legit or does this seem like paper mâché, they built it, you know, out of something--
Griffin: It’s funny that you ask that--totally paper mâché. Like this is like a--this is very much a set.
Travis: Great! OK.
Griffin: There is a large bulletin board next to the entrance of the dungeon with some long scrolls attached to it. And gathered around this circle you see different Bureau of Balance employees--some you’ve met before, some you probably haven’t put in the effort to meet--and they’re all congregating in groups of four. And they seem like really touchy-feely, for lack of a better term.
Travis: Ewwww.
Griffin: Like they’ve just like. Like they’ve just had this wonderful experience. You see a quartet just sitting--oh god!--oh that had a lid on it thank God--um, you see a quartet on the ground in a circle with their arms wrapped around each other, you see a dwarven woman sitting on a bench with three other Bureau employees just kind of comforting her as she has this like emotional moment, you see--
Travis: Ew.
Griffin: --other characters from the show, like Avi, Johann, Leon, and the Director, and they’re very excitedly recapping the events of the trial, and they’re laughing and hugging like a lot, so all around you are these groups that are having these enthusiastic conversations and these emotional interactions. And as you approach the entrance to the trial, you see the head counselor for Camp Good Friend, whose name is Bartholomew Croft. And you’ve probably interacted with him a few times throughout the weekend, he’s a very over enthusiastic elven guy who wears sunscreen... which is probably the first time you’ve seen that--[laughing] he probably invented sunscreen in this fantasy world. [Clint laughs.]
Griffin: And he motions you toward the signup board, and he says:
Art: Hello boys! Uh, how were your sessions today, did you learn any new life skills or make any new friends?
Magnus: No! [Audience laughs.]
Merle: [not in character voice] Uh, we, we--the food was good! The food was really good.
Taako: Yeah, except who stops--
Justin: Wait. Fucking stop. Try it again.
Merle: [in character voice] The food was good!
Justin: Thank you.
Travis: Boom!
Justin: Fucking--killing me.
Taako: Who stops serving pancakes at 9 AM? [Audience laughs and cheers.] I missed the whole thing! I had to get Cheetos! Fantasy Cheetos! [Griffin and Travis laugh.]
Taako: From the--the store! From the, from the uh--what do you call that--trading posts. [Justin and Griffin laugh.]
Art: OK, well, there’s one spot left on the signup sheet for the Trial of Teamwork, you’d better get in there while you still can! I’m Bobcat--I’m played by Bobcat Goldthwait a little bit!
[Audience, Travis, and Clint laugh.]
Griffin: You don’t--
Magnus: We do, yeah, we do--what did you say? Yeah--
Art: You’ve gotta sign up for the Trial of Teamwork, pay attention! I just said it four seconds ago!
Magnus: Is it like, is it a verbal signup or do we need to like, actually like write--
Art: There’s a fucking bulletin board right--[breaks into laughter, audience laughs]
Magnus: OK, yeah, do--like, yeah, do I--wait. I have to check my inventory, do I have a pen?
[Audience laughs.]
Art [exercising tremendous restraint]: A pen will be provided to you!
Justin: Our greatest challenge yet!
Clint: Should we roll something?
Travis: Yeah, do we need to--
Clint: Is there a pen initiative?
Griffin: Jesus.
Travis: Do we need to roll [unintelligible] to see who signs up first?
Griffin: We’re allowed to go until 9:30 PM with this show, right?
Travis: I rolled a 2!
Justin: OK--OK we--
Clint: I rolled a 12 in cursive.
Justin: OK, we--we do that.
Griffin: OK, Dad, with that 12 in cursive you write Morple on the board. Good enough!
Justin [laughing]: Pobody’s nerfect!
Griffin: He says:
Art: The other--the other two boys, you don’t seem too enthusiastic about the Trial of Teamwork! Don’t you wanna earn the Teamwork Medal?
Griffin: And he holds up a medallion.
Magnus: Now I do!
Justin: Whoa!
Griffin: There’s a golden medallion, a golden round medallion, and on it, emblazoned on it, are two big burly arms reaching in for a powerful handshake.
Clint: Arms?
Griffin: Yeah. Well no these are--these are decorative arms.
Travis: Magnus can’t sign up fast enough.
Griffin: OK. Magnus signs up.
Travis: He shoves Art out of the way to get to it.
Art: Taako--
Travis: Even though he’s not in the way.
Art: Taako, come on, don’t be afraid, I’m just here to help you become a better us! That’s one of my taglines! [laughs, audience laughs]
Justin: I uh, I cast mage hand and make--
Art [exasperated by their antics]: OK, fucking great.
Justin: that hand sign for me.
Griffin: OK.
Justin: I’m not gonna--
Art: That’s technically perjury I think!
[Griffin, Clint, and Justin laugh.]
Griffin: The three of you have signed up for the last spot for the Trial of Teamwork, and you notice there’s a fourth spot in this, in this, this signup sheet, and Art says:
Art: Oh, that’s right, teams for the Trial of Teamwork have to have four people! And actually, there’s somebody who specifically requested to join your, your outfit in this attempt! Hey, Brad!
[Silence]
Stage crew: Brad?
Justin: Brad?
Clint [calling]: Brad!
[Audience cheering as Stuart walks onstage.]
Justin: Hey, Brad.
Clint: [gruffly] Hello, Brad.
Travis: Hey Brad!
Stuart: Hey guys, how’re you doing?
Griffin: Uh, everyone, this is Brad Bradson, who is being played by Stuart Wellington from the Flophouse podcast! [Audience cheering.]
Stuart: Hey guys!
Griffin: It’s our first time having a guest on the show, so we’re all very scared right now. [Stuart and the audience laugh.]
Stuart: Mainly me!
Griffin: What’s uh--tell us about Brad Bradson a little bit, Stuart.
Stuart: OK, let me [getting situated/consulting character sheet--Griffin laughs]--let me see… Brad works for Human Resources, for the Bureau of Balance. Brad is from a tribe of hill people. His father was Brad the Bloodthirsty. His grandfather was Brad the Bonebreaker.
Griffin [laughing]: So he’s sort of gone away from his, uh--
Stuart: Yeah, well, kinda! He’s searching for his own truth.
Griffin: OK! [laughs] That’s so important.
Stuart: So his enemies know him as Brad the Motivator. And that’s what I’m here to do today, guys!
Griffin: And I wanna--I’m curious if you all have met Brad before, if you’ve had any interactions with Human Resources.
Magnus: I--I keep getting notes from someone named Brad but it’s a mystery to me.
Clint: There was one office Christmas party but I think we both wanna forget it right now.
Griffin: OK! Taako?
Justin: No. [Griffin bursts into laughter.]
Griffin: Brad, have you heard of these three before?
Stuart: Oh, I’ve heard plenty about these three.
Griffin: OK! Uh, Brad Bradson, you walk over and sign up on the signup sheet, and finally you have a full team! And uh, Art Goodfriend leads you towards the, the cobblestone archway into the hilltop dungeon, and as you walk over there, the gate opens up, and you see a few familiar faces--you see Carey and Killian, and Noelle and Angus emerge from the archway, and Angus is riding on Noelle’s robot shoulders [audience coos] and they’re just--they’re all just having a great time! Their faces are, are, are streaked with tears of joy, and they’re just like excitedly retelling what happened in the dungeon below! And Carey says:
Carey: Oh my god! Taako! You gotta get in there! It’s--it’s life-changing stuff! Hey Bill!
Griffin: And walks past the group.
Brad: Say, uh, careful guys, don’t fall off her shoulders.
[Griffin and the audience laugh.]
Travis: Wait, are you HR or are you a safety inspector?
Stuart: It’s a little bit of both, you know? [Travis laughs.]
Griffin: Angus says:
Angus: Hello sirs!
Justin: Eugh.
Angus: I’m excited for what you’re gonna--I’m excited for what you’re going to learn about in there!
Magnus: High five!
Angus: Vis a vis treating your coworkers nicer!
[Justin and the audience laugh.]
Magnus: High five!
Travis: Weeell, I was about to do a thing, but now maybe not.
Clint: If we kill anybody is it canon?
Griffin: Jesus. [Audience laughs.]
Clint: Well I’m just saying!
Travis: Ango is still a child!
Griffin: So the gate--
Travis: You heard it here first! Clint McElroy will kill a child for humor!
Griffin: The gate opens again and Art motions you inside and says:
Art: Good luck! And great teamwork!
Travis [making fun of his voice]: I’m melting!
[Clint laughs.]
Justin: We could literally be walking into a dragon’s maw and it’d be better than spending another fucking second with Art. [Clint laughs.]
Travis: We do that! We walk into the dragon’s maw!
Griffin: OK.
Brad: I think Art’s pretty great actually, guys.
Magnus: OK.
Clint: It’s a two dollar cover.
Griffin: There uh, before you’re allowed to go in, there’s a deposit box where you have to drop off all of your magic items. Not your weapons, you still get to keep those, but you don’t get to keep any of your magic--
Justin: I printed out a whole list!
Clint [laughing]: I know, he’s got a whole sheet of stuff in his bag!
Travis: To be fair,
[Justin throws the sheet into the crowd.]
Clint: And now it’s gone.
Travis: Anything in Magnus’s hands is--
Justin: Collector’s item. [Griffin laughs.]
Clint: Did you sign it?
Justin: Wait! Did I put any in my butt? Hey! Can I put--are there any of those that could’ve fit in my butt? You just check and let me know later.
Travis: Is there anything he can hoop?
Clint: It didn’t come out of his butt, it’s OK to open it!
Justin: I sneak it into my butt.
Audience member: This list is huge!
Justin: Yeah, I’ve been keeping a lot of items. Not all in my butt. [Griffin laughs.]
Clint: Enough to make him walk funny.
Griffin: So you move through the archway and into a small round chamber,
Audience member: Pocket spa, maybe?
Griffin: Pocket spa, do you wanna shove a tent in your ass? [Audience laughs.]
Travis: Hey, don’t yuck his yum!
Justin: Let’s abandon this plan!
Griffin: Yeah, I don’t wanna yuck any yums, do you wanna put a pop tent in your butt? Alright, let’s move on, let’s move on. You move on through the archway and into a small round chamber, the only thing of note in here is a small design carved onto the stone floor that reads “Enter Colleagues, Exit Best Friends”.
Clint: God. Almighty.
Griffin: And ahead of you is a long narrow--ahead of you is a long narrow stone staircase leading down a tunnel down into the hill and underground, and as you move down it, there’s a surprisingly warm breeze blowing up the stairs.
Travis: Magnus starts running towards the breeze. [Audience laughs]
Griffin: It’s literally a breeze!
Travis: He’s running!
Griffin: It’s wind! OK--
Travis: Can’t stop him!
Justin: Are you--are you like, an excitable man or a monarch butterfly?! [Griffin laughs.] Like literally!
Griffin: And as you, uh, finish your descent down these long, narrow stairs, you emerge into a large room lit by several huge sconces built into the wall, and it is kind of a shitty room! It’s uh, it’s about the size of a cellar, and it’s kind of decorated in like, paper mâché dungeon attire, like it looks like a theatre set designed to look like a--or like a spooky haunted house, like a lot of, a lot of hard--what’s that hard foam that you spray and it makes it look like--
Travis: Hard foam.
Griffin: Yeah, you got it. So yeah, you’re in basically a fake dungeon.
Travis: Magnus walks around for a while just poking his finger through stuff.
Griffin: Yeah, you can, like you walk to the paper mâché wall and it just goes boink! [Travis giggles.] straight through it. And uh, as you enter this large chamber--
Brad: People--people worked on that room, Magnus!
Magnus: OK!
[Clint and Griffin laugh.]
Griffin: This is gonna be great. As you enter the chamber, the portcullis drops behind you, preventing your exit from the Trial of Teamwork.
Travis: I wanna do a strength check to pick it back up.
Griffin [laughing]: OK?
Travis: There’s a six?
Griffin [laughing]: Nooo.
Travis: Plus! Eight. So, a fourteen!
Griffin: Jesus, plus eight? Yeah, you could get out if you wanted to. [He breaks into laughter; Clint laughs too.]
Travis: I do that a couple times just [miming picking the portcullis up] ehh? Ehh? OK.
Griffin: And let’s get into the first trial! So, you’re standing in front of the first trial, and about 6 inches off the ground is a series of five 6½ foot long planks of wood, the ends of which are resting on small, circular metal pegs built into the ground, they make a zigzag pattern over a span of 30 feet, and you notice that below this series of planks, or essentially this low ropes course, is red carpet. And above you, you hear a loudspeaker being activated and you hear Art’s voice through the loudspeaker. And he says, uh, oh I should: [He cups his hands over his mouth to simulate the sound of a loudspeaker]
Art: For your first trial--
Travis: What?
Justin: Unintelligible.
Clint: Huh?
Griffin: Oh, you really can’t hear that?
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: No.
Griffin: Well, imagine a little loudspeaker effect. Can you do that in post? Do you have a knob over there that’s like, loudspeaker—?
Stage crew: Yeah.
Clint: As his voice comes through these loudspeakers,
Griffin: I got a thumbs up--I got a thumbs up, I don’t see any knobs twiddling over there! So, over the loudspeaker, you hear:
Art: For your first trial, your whole team has to cross the planks to the other side! But be careful! ‘Cause the floor is lava!
[Audience laughter.]
Travis: Magnus pokes the red carpet.
Art: Don’t touch the lava! Unless you wanna earn Teamwork Penalties!
Magnus: It’s not lava--it’s not lava! It’s a carpet!
Art: OK!
Griffin: And the loudspeaker clicks off.
Travis: Magnus goes running across the planks or whatever.
Griffin: OK, make an acrobatics roll. [Justin laughs as Travis rolls.]
Travis: Eight. Plus. Two.
Griffin: A ten is actually OK, you’re just running all the way across?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: OK, Magnus has crossed the bridge by himself!
[Scattered audience applause.]
Justin: How big are like the gaps in between--like how big of a--?
Griffin: They’re not--there’s not that big a gap, it’s just--
Justin [laughing]: So it’s just like a bridge?
Griffin: Well, the boards are pretty narrow, so you gotta be careful or else you’ll step in the [singsong] laaavaaa. [Audience laughs]
Travis: Is there room to walk around the sides?
Griffin: Uh, I mean the planks are, are wide enough to like, you could hang out there for a second if you wanted to.
Travis: But is there like, empty floor space on the sides?
Griffin: No, it’s lava baby, lava all over.
Clint: Is it really lava? [Stuart laughs.]
Stuart: Yeah, yeah, is it really lava?
Griffin [laughing]: Uh, no, it’s uh, red carpet on the floor!
Clint: Well, Merle walks across the red car--no, he doesn’t. Jumps across the red carpet!
Griffin: You’re gonna jump thirty horizontal feet?
Clint: I am gonna jump! Yes!
Griffin: Alright, make an--make--make an athletics roll!
Clint: OK!
Griffin: To jump--to jump--hey, Dad? To jump 30 horizontal feet. [Justin giggles in the background as the audience uproariously laughs.]
Travis: You can do it!
Griffin: Did you know they just set a new world record in the Olympics for the long jump? For like fucking 8?
Justin [laughing]: And the Olym--and the Olympics are--for humans!
Griffin: But go ahead and do it! [Justin bursts into laughter.] Because you said it! Go ahead and roll your 30--
Clint [yelling]: OK! Screw you! I will!
Travis: Nope.
Clint: What am I looking at?
Travis: Not any of this.
Justin: Just roll a d20, you always just roll a d20!
Clint: Yeah, but I gotta know what my amplifier is--
Travis: You have a plus 0.
Justin: Plus 0?!
Griffin: Plus 0! Perfect baby! Yeah! Let them bones roll!
Travis [chanting]: Crit! Crit! Crit! Crit!
Clint: Yeah!
Travis: It’s an 8!
Clint: It’s an--I can read! It’s an 8.
Griffin: You jump--
Justin: But on a sideways it’s infinity which is the roll he would need [breaking into laughter, audience cheers and claps] to get to actually make the jump!
Clint: Nailed it!
Justin [yelling]: To jump 30 horizontal feet, Clinton!
Griffin: You jump--you jump 5½ feet and you land right on the carpet, like one sixth of the way past this trial.
Clint: Oh! No, I was jumping over where the plank is! So I landed on the plank at some point.
Griffin: Bullshit you did! Make the best acrobatics roll of your life and I’ll see if you land on the plank! There it goes.
Travis: Do it.
Griffin: Here it goes!
Stuart: I think he’s gonna do it!
Griffin: Now we’re playing D&D, baby!
Travis: Roll!
Clint [rolling]: Yeah! Rolled a… hey!
Travis: It’s a 17.
Stuart: Just read it.
Clint: 17 and I add a 0.
Griffin: OK. OK, yeah, that’s enough--you land on your belly on the plank like, like this like, inches from the red carpet, but you didn’t, you didn’t--
Clint: So like right out of America’s Funniest Videos?
Griffin: But you cleared like one board!
Clint: OK!
Stuart: I start clapping.
Griffin: OK.
Brad: That’s a great first try, Merle! Well done!
Merle: Thank you! Thank you very much, Bart!
Magnus: This is like, really easy! You just walk across ‘em!
Merle: Where’s the fun in that?
Magnus: OK. We have like a whole show to do.
Griffin: Somebody else do something!
Stuart: I start tearing up pieces of paper in the shape of the logs and I put ‘em on the floor and start trying to arrange them in a puzzle.
Griffin: Fuck yeah! Whatever, whatever you roll to get across it, you have advantage on.
Stuart: Oh, advantage! Uh, I’m gonna say insight, and that is--
Griffin [laughing]: Wait, no! OK! No! I mean, you just have whatever you use to cross the bridge, you can’t use insight to cross the--I see you, bridge!
Stuart: Oh! I don’t know!
Griffin: I was thinking of advantage on whatever you do to get across the bridge.
Clint: He has two! He’s got two of ‘em!
Griffin: Yeah, he’s got advantage, that’s what it means, we’ve been playing Dungeons and Dragons for two years!
Stuart: Then I will hold onto my clipboard and run across those boards--
Griffin: Are you fucking jumping over Merle?
Stuart: Uh, yeah! No, I mean, I’ll tap him on the shoulder and say “great job” and then keep running.
Griffin: OK.
Clint: And I’ll raise up at the worst possible moment--whack!
Justin: While this is all going on I cast fucking levitate on myself
Griffin: OK.
Justin: and I float across the lava like a grown man.
Griffin: OK! [Audience applause.]
Justin: Or in this case, elf.
Griffin: It is effortless.
Justin: I guess, as the case may be.
Griffin: It is effortless. Woop! Taako just goes across.
Stuart: I got a 17 for my athletics roll.
Griffin: OK! Yeah, and you’re--what’re you doing? What is the--interaction between Merle and you on the bridge?
Stuart: I say:
Brad: You did a wonderful job, Merle, keep going.
Clint: And with that encouragement, I clear the rest of the planks. [Stuart laughs.]
Griffin: Uh, no, you can make another acrobatics roll to finish crossing the rest of it.
Clint: How far--
Justin: He should get advantage on it because that was very motivational!
Clint: Yeah!
Griffin: Uh, you--the check will be lower than 10, I’ll say that.
Clint: OK!
Griffin: Between the--
Clint: Thank God! … But I have advantage, though, didn’t that--
Justin: Nooo.
Griffin: No dawg, what’d you roll?
Stuart: Can I enhance his ability with Enhance Ability?
Griffin: Yeah, sure!
Stuart: I enhance his ability.
Griffin: What does it mean?
Stuart: Uhh, I think he has--wait. Uh, he has… uh… [singsong] wait a second following effects some kind of thing that I don’t know!
Travis [laughing]: It doesn’t say anything great, Brad!
Stuart: You didn’t fill out my damn card! I guess it gives him advantage.
Griffin: Alright, your acrobatic--wait, and roll your--do you have an instrument? What is your instrument, Brad the Bard?
Stuart: It’s oratory. [Griffin breaks into laughter.]
Stuart: Clearly!
Travis: Brad did a lot of speech and debate in high school!
Griffin: So when you--when you--so this whole time when you’re like ‘hey keep it up!’ that’s literally you casting magic spells.
Stuart: Exactly!
Griffin: That’s fucking amazing. OK, so, roll it again, and you have a plus 2 on your roll. [Long pause as Clint rolls.]
Travis: It’s a 14.
Justin: Do you want different dice? I love you very much. Do you--
Griffin: Do you need different eyeballs?!
Clint: I don’t have my glasses! Fourteen!
Travis: Could you please pass my dad his glasses? Thank you.
Clint: Thank you, honey.
Griffin: There you go.
Travis: We’ll be here all day.
Griffin: It’s a family show. I already know it’s a 14 plus--
Justin: Hey look, it’s the Spectacles of You Should’ve Had Those In The First Place!
Griffin: Oh yeah, that’s part of the costume--
Justin: The legendary spectacles!
Clint: 14!
Griffin: Alright, yeah, you make it across the bridge. All of you have cleared the first Trial of Teamwork! [Audience cheers.]
Travis: Thank you.
Clint: Without manifesting a single shred of teamwork!
Griffin: Well, that’s not true!
Clint: Except for Brent.
Griffin: Over the--over the loudspeaker-- [break for audience laughter]
Stuart: Almost right on the first try, it’s Brad, you’ll get it next time.
Clint: Brad. [Griffin laughs.]
Travis: Onward! Magnus runs ahead!
Clint: Woo!
Griffin: Over the loudspeaker you hear:
Art: Well that was a… decent job, but two of you did cross without using any teamwork at all so I’m afraid you’ve incurred one Teamwork Penalty!
Magnus: Yaaay!
Merle: Nooo!
Griffin: Um, I could use a pen if anybody has one? It’s not important, but uh, I just need a pen--well, you’ll need that pen for--yeah, that’s great, can I borrow that? Thank you! I’ll return it.
Clint: No he won’t.
Griffin: I need to keep track of your Teamwork Penalties. TPs: 1. Uh, OK! He says:
Art: Do you guys know what that trial was supposed to teach you?
Magnus: No!
Taako: No.
Art: You don’t wanna wager a guess about what the trial was supposed to mean?
Magnus: The floor is lava!
Merle: Not criticizing your parents!
[Audience laughter.]
Art: That’s not a bad lesson!
Justin: Uh, I was about to say using character voices, but he kinda cut my legs out from underneath me on that one.
Taako: [exaggerated] Not using character voices!
Art: No, it’s supposed to mean that we all walk the same path in life and it’s easier with help with your friends!
[Audience coos.]
Travis: Bleh. [Audience laughs.]
Taako: Alright, next challenge!
Griffin: [laughs] OK! You are on the second trial, and you’re standing in front of a smooth wooden wall. It’s about 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide. It’s several feet deep as well, and those are the dimensions of the wall, everybody! And um, it’s built--it’s built into the floor and it’s pretty sturdy and the loudspeaker clicks on and you hear Art say:
Art: For this challenge you have to help each other up and over the wall! Make sure you don’t leave your guys behind!
Clint: Your dies?
Travis: Can I jump up it?
Griffin (incredulous): What the fuck is wrong with you guys not understanding jumping abilities?!
Travis: 15 feet isn’t that much!
Griffin: 15 feet is one and a half stories!
Clint: I almost did 30!
Travis: Here’s what I’m gonna do! I’m gonna jump and then plant Railsplitter in and pull myself the rest of the way up.
Griffin: OK, yeah, that works. Then actually this would be--make an attack roll on the wall. This should be better for you!
Travis: That’s a 5 plus 9. 14.
Griffin: I mean it’s a wall, so yeah, you get a--
Travis: It’s not gonna dodge!
Griffin: You jump and get it in there and then uh, make a, make an athletics roll to finish climbing the rest of the way up. [Justin gentle beatboxing as rolling and math happens]
Travis: 13?
Griffin: Yeah, you’re good. Uh, you, uh--
Travis: Plus 8! 21!
Griffin: You manage to go up. Quick question though, do you take the axe with you?
Travis: Yeah! I’m not fucking leaving Railsplitter down there!
Griffin (delighted): Fucking wonderful. You take this handle that you installed in the wall for yourself and you reach the top of the wall by yourself!
Travis: I’m. I might drop a rope?
Griffin: You don’t have any items with you other than your weapons.
Travis: Not even a- you said magic items! I don’t have a rope?
Griffin: Ropes are pretty magical if you think about it! You can tie two things together, you can--there’s all kinds of stuff you can do with a rope!
Travis: [crosstalk] OK, I lay down--I lay down on my stomach and kinda, y’know, lower an arm down.
Griffin: Oh, that’s really sweet of you. Uh, OK, uh, what’s everybody else doing?
Clint: What’s the--what’s the wall made out of?
Griffin: Wood.
Stuart: And we’ve gotta go--what now--13 feet up?
Travis: I’ve got about 3--
Griffin: How long are your arms?!
Taako: Oh now hold on everybody! I got it! No problem!
Justin: I cast Reduce. Which is second-level transmutation, on the wall!
Griffin: OK! [Griffin and the audience laugh.]
Griffin: OK! You--you are reducing--what does that do?
Justin: I mean, I can cause an object within range to grow smaller or larger for the duration.
Griffin: Does it say how small--how small are you making this wall?
Justin: Uh--
Clint: Better make it about 2 feet.
Justin: It literally doesn’t say.
Griffin: Alright, then you tell me, dawg! How big’s the wall now?
Justin: It’s, uh. It’s two feet tall. Just enough to be adorable.
Clint: Like a Malibu Barbie Dream House.
Justin: Now everybody gets over the wall.
Griffin: OK, uh… OK, you shrink the--
Travis: Well, fuck me, I guess!
Griffin: Yeah, you shrink--yeah, here’s a, fuck you double, the wall shrinks very fast and Magnus, you like, you were on your chest when it shrinks, and so when the wall just is suddenly 8 feet shorter, you fall 8 feet and land on your ribs on the corner of the wooden wall and you take 7 damage! [Audience laughs, claps.]
Travis: Can I see your pen, Brad?
Justin: I was trying to do good!
Griffin: Uh, OK! The wall is now 2 feet tall, you can. Now, just because you guys have some trouble with spatial stuff, that’s tall enough to climb over easily.
{~28:53}
[Audience laughs]
Stuart: As I climb over I rub Magnus’s shoulder and whisper,
Brad: Feel better, friend!
Stuart: And cast Healing Word.
Griffin: Oh nice! [Audience awws]
Justin: [incredulously, talking over Stuart] Is this what it’s like to play Dungeon and Dragons with a competent person!?
Brad: We’re doing great guys!
Griffin: Uh, okay.
Merle: Oh, we are so gonna let you die. Nothin’ personal.
Brad: If that’s my truth; so be it.
[All laughing and exclaiming]
Griffin: [Laughing] Wait! Holy shit!
Travis: Hold on!
Griffin: Brad, that’s how deep it goes? That’s how deep your well of motivation goes?
Brad: You gotta trust in the universe to provide. Death sometimes.
[All laughing]
Griffin: Okay. Uh, you, uh, you, you clear this wall, and--
Clint: I haven’t cleared it yet.
Griffin: Oh, okay. It’s two feet tall. What are you doing?
Justin: Let’s make a fuckin’ three act play out of it.
Clint: I wanna jump over it!
Griffin: All right, you’re jumpin’ over it, here we go!
Travis: Three.
Clint: [echoes] Three.
Griffin: You fuckin’ hit your feet on the wall and you fall over it and land on your face for four damage. [Audience hooting, laughing]
Travis: [muffled] So bad!
Griffin: Taako.
Clint: Try to have a little panache...
Justin: [weary from the depths of his soul] What. What?
Griffin: What do you do? Do you just…
Justin: [exasperated] I walk over the wall that I shrunk. With magic.
Griffin: Alright. Uh, you, uh. You make it over the wall.
Justin: And I can’t-- I literally, not a joke, kick Merle in his fuckin’ ribs, ‘cause I’m so, so angry at him. But I have a soft shoe. It’s not damage inducing, just-- I’m so mad.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: I can live with it.
Travis: I trip-- I trip Taako as he goes over for hurting my ribs. [Griffin, audience laughing]
Griffin: [laughing] Oh god. Alright. Alright. Taako, Taako, [laughing] make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: It’s a seven.
Griffin: Alright, yeah, you fall over!
Justin: Plus!
Clint: Plus!
Justin: Plus! Three.
Griffin: Uh, okay, I’d say that does it. Ten, ten’ll clear it.
Justin: [sucks teeth] A little stumble, but I regain my balance.
Griffin: Yeah, you’re fine. Uh.
Stuart: I’m taking a lot of notes at this point.
{~30:56}
Griffin: Yeah… Art actually chimes in, he’s like:
Art: You guys know you earned a teamwork penalty for that one, right? You know I don’t have to tell you,
Magnus: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah.
Art: Like three of you actively hurt other people.
Magnus: We did start off well though, there was, like we know there was,
Art: [crosstalk] No, there was,
Taako: No, we started off bad! You put an axe in the wall and then stole it, we started off very bad!
Magnus: I lowered my hand back down, [unintelligible]
Merle: Yeah, after he put a guilt trip on ya.
Magnus: That’s teamwork sometimes.
Brad: Guys, we can agree to disagree, right?
Magnus: Fuck off Brad!
[Audience laughs]
Merle: I think it’s Brent.
Griffin: You’re onto the third trial.
Art: Oh, do you know what that trial was supposed to teach you guys?
[Audience Laughs]
Taako: [half laughing] Now, no, but I’m going to guess we didn’t learn it.
Art: Sometimes life throws obstacles at you, sometimes, and it’s easier to get over ‘em with the help from your friends.
Brad: Riiight, right, right, ok.
Griffin: So you’re onto the third trial, and immediately in front of you is this, a fifteen foot high wall, another one. A separate fifteen foot high wall that I definitely planned for. No, fuck it, we gotta do, [Clint laughing] I gotta respect the fiction.
It’s the same wall that you were just standing on that you shrank down, this now two foot high wall. Off the back of this wall, is a set of now very small stairs leading back down to the ground, but the majority of the backside of this wall is now just a ledge with a two foot drop. And the loud speaker chirps on, and he goes,
Art: This is gonna be kinda anticlimactic, but it’s time for trust falls.
[Griffin, audience laughs]
[Justin laughs loudly]
Art: Ummmm, it’s only two feet, but,
Travis: Magnus falls off it.
Griffin: [laughing] Ok, just,
Magnus: Catch me Art!
Griffin: Ok, the falling style here is like backwards, not looking.
Travis: Full on.
Griffin: [exasperated] So you just fall backwards off the back off the wall.
Travis: I trust everyone.
Griffin: Ok…
Travis: Wait, hold on, give them a chance.
{33:09}
[Silence]
Griffin: Who!?
Travis: My friends.
Griffin: They’re not-- [sputters] there waiting to catch you! Everybody’s by the wa--
Travis: It’s two feet. They could do it.
Griffin: Uh. You fall, but it’s just two feet so you don’t take any damage. But now you’re in catching position for everybody else. [pause] Who’s-- who’s going?
Justin: [sounding extremely done] Me. I fall. [Laughter]
Justin: He catches me. We all move on with our lives. [Laughter]
Griffin: Make a strength check.
Travis: Fifteen plus eight.
Griffin: You super catch Taako.
Brad: Great job, guys.
Travis: I throw him over my shoulder!
Magnus: Next!
Stuart: I kinda push Merle out of the way, ‘cause I want to do it.
Griffin: Okay! [Audience laughing]
Magnus: Come on, Brad!
Griffin: [under his breath] Oh, dea-- [louder] The ol’ Brad’s got a dark side!
Brad: Now it’s Brad’s time to shine, guys.
Stuart: And I arms-wide-open back into Magnus’s arms.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I move. [Audience gives loud, surprised “Oooh!”s]
Griffin: Do you really?
Travis: [to audience] It’s two feet! He’s gonna be fine! [back into mic] I’ve already got Taako over one shoulder.
Stuart: No, no. It’s cool. It’s cool. It’s fine.
Griffin: Uh. Yeah, Brad, yeah. You fall on your back, Brad. And you don’t take any damage, but it’s embarrassing.
Justin: [pained] Oh no! [Clint cackles]
Stuart: I’ve been embarrassed before.
Griffin: Yeah.
Brad: It’s okay, guys. Next time, you know, you’ll catch me next time I fall.
[Clint continues laughing]
Brad: That’s what bein’ friends is all about, Magnus.
Magnus: [small] Okay.
Brad: Is catching your friends when they fall. And you know, sometimes you slip up.
Travis: Suddenly Magnus feels very bad. [Laughter]
Griffin: You, uh, you--
Travis: As does Travis. [Laughter]
Griffin: You actually fall. When you fall you land on some gum on the floor and it gets in your ponytail.
Stuart: Noo-oh! [Audience “no”ing with him]
Stuart: Uh. I quickly pull some peanut butter out of my pocket that I keep--
Griffin: You don’t have any items!
Stuart: Oh no! My magic peanut butter?
Travis: No, it’s just -- it’s just loose peanut butter.
Merle: Hey! Listen, Magnus’ll chop your ponytail off for you, if you want.
Griffin: [laughs] Yeah, you’ve got a corrupted body part!
Merle: He does it all the time!
Brad: That is a… strange use of the word “if I want”. [Clint laughing] Because I do not want that. But sometimes... You know. Sometimes necessity requires sacrifices, guys, and I think this is one of those times--
Merle: Chop it off.
Stuart: So I hold my arm over my eyes, so I don’t have to see my beautiful ponytail --
Griffin: [horrified] Oh my god.
Stuart: --shorn from my head. And I say,
Brad: Do it, Magnus. I trust you. With your axe near my head.
Travis: I just… I just pull his hair out of the gum. It’s not. It’s not, like, a thing. I don’t have to cut it off.
Griffin: It’s super in there.
Clint: And I want you to look at this. [Audience crows, a yell of “Oh my god!” rings over the sound, appreciative clapping, presumably Clint is gesturing to his arm?] Alright? Look at this. Alright. Make sure you know what’s comin’.
Griffin: Make an attack roll? On Brad’s hair.
Travis: I want you to know. I’m aiming for the very end, where the gum is, so I don’t have to cut off the whole thing.
Griffin: Yeah. It takes a long-- How long did it take you--
Clint: [crosstalk] So lay it on his chest!
Griffin: Hold on! Wait, before you roll -- some backstory. How long you been workin’ on this ponytail, dog?
Stuart: Twenty-five years.
Griffin: Jesus!
Travis: I am aiming for the very last inch that’s stuck in the gum.
Griffin: Okay. Go ahead and roll. [dice]
Griffin: [into silence] Oh, god.
Travis: It’s a twenty. It’s a crit twenty. [cheers, clapping, Justin shouts “Yeah!”]
Griffin: Holy shit! Like a fucking samurai with Hattori Hanzo steel you-- in slow motion you watch each hair be severed and it flows away in the wind. And it leaves you with a lot of ponytail.
Brad: Thank you, Magnus. I think it looks better now, actually. You cleared off all my split ends!
Magnus: I feathered it! Anytime.
Griffin: Uh, Taako, did you trust fall already?
Justin: Uh, yeah. Remember...?
Travis: I got ‘em.
Griffin: Oh, that’s right. Alright. We’re all, we’re all, oh. Merle.
Clint: I’m gonna jump over it... [Stuart laughs]
Clint: Backwards. [Audience laughing, someone breathing loud.]
Clint: So, jump. Jump backwards.
Griffin: So like a trust jump.
Clint: A trust jump. What do I roll?
Justin: On the ground. You roll on the ground.
Griffin: The rule of thumb is, are you flipping? ‘Cause if you’re flipping it’s acrobatics.
Clint: Yeah, I flipped.
Griffin: Okay, what’d you get?
Clint: Uh, fourteen.
Griffin: Alright, yeah, you just jump over Magnus and you land on the floor and you didn’t really trust fall, but it was cool.
Merle: It’s all about how you look, baby.
Art: [smacks lips] That’s gonna be just one more quick teamwork penalty. [laughter] This is not going great. Anybody wanna just wager a guess at what the trust fall is supposed to teach you?
Magnus: Falling!
Taako: Trust?
Art: Trust is right! Yes!
Taako: [slyly] Sounds like we should get our penalty back for that.
Art: Nah, it’s still a penalty. You intentionally let a man fall into gum. And then you used an axe on him.
Travis: I--! That was good, though.
Griffin: It was good stuff. [Justin breaks in, singing a melody to transition into the commercial break.]
{Commercial Break: 37:34- 42:58}
Griffin: Alright, you’re onto the fourth trial. A few feet past the trust fall platform you see a small metal statue on a wooden pedestal and the statue depicts four adventurers: an armored dwarven fighter, a devout elven cleric, a bookish human wizard, and a guitar-wielding orc, all laughing and high-fiving each other, obviously a symbol of successful teamwork. From the loudspeaker you hear Art say:
Art: This is the Totem of Constructive Criticism. [Audience and Clint laugh] All you have to do to complete this trial is touch the statue and then give someone a piece of helpful advice on their performance, either in this dungeon or just in general. Once all four of you have given some advice you can move on. But don’t be nasty unless you want to get some teamwork penalties.
[Audience Laughter]
Clint: So we have to say something nice?
Travis: Nope, constructive.
Griffin: [Exasperated] No, it’s the Totem of Constructive Criticism! [Audience Laughs]
Clint: Okay.
Griffin: Who’s going first? [Silence]
[Audience Laughter]
Justin: You know I saw we had some cosplay in the audience today-
Griffin: Who’s going- Okay, we’re actually at about forty five, fifty minutes right now, so-
Travis: Okay, okay, I put my hand on it and I say
Magnus: Brad-
Griffin: Okay, wait, as you touch it. As you touch the statue, one of the four heroes lights up. And the hero that lights up for you, Magnus, is the human wizard. So you have to give a piece of constructive criticism for Taako.
Taako: Yeah go ahead.
Travis: Oh dick!
Magnus: Taako-
Taako: [Drawn out] Yes?
Magnus: I feel like…
Taako: [Drawn out] Go on?
Magnus: Sometimes you cast spells without any consideration of whether or not it might injure me specifically.
[Audience Laughs]
Taako: A touch, a palpable touch, I do confess it.
Magnus: And I would like it if you would stop doing that, because our cleric sucks at healing.
[Audience Laughs]
Griffin: Okay, that-
Magnus: It’s not about you cleric!
Merle: Wait, hold on, wait-
Griffin: That part of the statue turns gold, and he actually turns to give you a thumbs-up.
Travis: Nailed it!
Griffin: Who’s next?
Justin: Me.
Griffin: Taako, you touch the statue, and the cleric lights up [Justin: Fuck] You need to give a piece of constructive criticism for Merle. [Silence, followed by audience laughter]
[Justin laughs]
Travis: I just want to remind you that this is our Daddy.
Griffin: It’s our Da- Hey Justin, it’s our Daddy though.
Justin: Yeah, [audience laughs] no no no no no.
Taako: Your spells … can … be used... to heal wounds!
[Griffin and Audience laugh]
Taako: So maybe… give ‘er a shot!
[Audience laughs]
Griffin: And with that the elven cleric turns gold and gives you a big thumbs-up. Who’s next?
Clint: I’ll go.
Griffin: Merle, you
Merle: I’ll go
Griffin: You touch the statue and the dwarven fighter lights up, and you need to give a constructive criticism for Magnus.
Travis: For your middlest boy. [Griffin: For your-]
Justin: [laughing] Wait is Brad gonna have to compliment himself? [Audience laughter]
Griffin: [Also laughing] We’ll see. Constructive criticism for Magnus.
Merle: I think that I would worry a lot less in those times when I’m pondering the fate of you, if maybe you didn’t rush into every situation like a giant horse’s ass.
[Audience laughter]
Magnus: Well put.
Griffin: Alright, like that the dwarven fighter turns gold, gives you a big thumbs-up, and all that’s left is Brad.
Brad: I’ll go next guys.
Magnus: Cool, Brad.
Merle: Good choice.
Stuart: I go up-
Merle: Good math
Stuart: I go up and touch the statue.
Griffin: Alright, yeah, the orc bard lights up and you need to just sort of give yourself, just sort of do a quick sort of--
Stuart: Some self inventory.
Griffin: Yeah debrief yourself on how it’s been going so far and what you could do better.
Brad: You know, Brad, [Clint Laughs]
Clint: I think of Stuart on Saturday Night Live looking in the mirror.
Brad: Brad, you know, sometimes you don’t let people get close enough and know the real you.
Griffin: Jesus.
Brad: You hold people at bay, you focus too much on kind of your work relationships and not maybe a relationship outside of work, Brad. You know, they could get to know the Brad that likes to party, you know, that brews his own beer at home and has a stamp collection.
[Silence]
Griffin: Okay yeah, the orc turns gold and gives you a big thumbs-up. [Travis laughs] And Art chimes in and says:
Art: Well it got a little nasty there, but you still managed to get through the thing and so I’m gonna not give you a teamwork penalty on that one.
Magnus: Yeah! We solved your stupid puzzle!
Art: And the advice is- The lessons, good advice makes for good friends. I didn't wanna waste time having you try to guess it.
Magnus: Okay!
Griffin: Uh, alright the fifth and final trial. You're standing in front of a large cobblestone wall and again this wall is mostly styrofoam, like a, like a theatrical set. There's uh, a door, a semi-circular door, and a crudely painted sign hanging over the door that marks it as the entrance into The Arena. And you hear Art say,
Art: In here, you'll face a deadly opponent. It's up to you to work together, protect each other, and take him down, carefully. Please.
[Audience & Travis laughs]
Travis: Magnus rushes in.
Griffin: You open the door-
Travis: To be fair, I didn't say that, I wanna run right through the door.
Griffin: You can, yeah, it's- it's essentially, uh, foam.
Travis: I wanna leave a Magnus shaped hole in the door.
Griffin: You just knock the door completely down, uhm, and uh, Art, Arts like,
Art: Well, people have to use this later- okay, whatever.
Griffin: And this arena is absolutely clown town. There are some large foam geometric shapes scattered around the arena almost like it's like a laser tag arena. Um, and the whole thing is encircled in this styrofoam wall, and in the middle of this McDonaldLand play place is a large person wearing a costume designed to make them look like a skeletal dragon, but it's really just like a child's skeleton costume from the neck down, like a black sort of suit with bones on it and like a spooky skeleton dragon mask on top, and he goes:
Skelly: Roar! I'm Skelly the Skeletal Dragon! I can only be beaten by great teamwork!
Travis: Magnus sees red. [Audience laughs]
Griffin: [laughs] U-uh, he's got a, he's got a bucket, and he starts reaching in and getting these little foam balls out and throwing them at all of you.
Travis: Magnus tackles him.
Griffin: Heh, Actually everyone make a dex save to avoid these, fireballs he's throwing.
Justin: [snort-laughs? snickers?] Three.
Clint: What, uh, what am I rolling?
Justin: [unison] A d20-
Griffin: [unison] A d20,
Clint: -a 20.
Travis: [Referring to Clint’s roll] One!
Clint: Oh my god!
Travis: I rolled a 19, er a 17 plus [unintelligible]
Griffin: The joke here was supposed to be that you're just getting hit by little foam balls thrown at you by a man in a skeleton costume, but with a one, I think you actually are gonna take some damage. [Audience laughter] You take nine points of damage from a-
Clint: [yells] WHAT? WAIT-
Griffin: It hits you in the- it hits you in the throat.
Clint: Did it have railroad spikes stickin' out of it?
Griffin: It hits you in the throat and you get the wind knocked out of you and you take nine points of damage.
Travis: Wow
Clint: Shiiiit.
Travis: You know that wind [Clint: Shoot, shoot.] doesn't live in your throat, right?
Griffin: Huh? [Audience laughter]
Travis: You get hit in the throat and the wind- doesn't matter.
Griffin: Do you [Clint] need me to keep track of your health or you need help with your iPad?
Clint: Let him have his fun… No, I got it.
Griffin: Okay, and uh, so you have this skeleton man throwing- Did you- Everybody, oh- Taako, you got hit by styrofoam balls, but it's fine. [crosstalk]
Stuart: I- I rolled a 19.
Griffin: Oh, you fuckin', [makes whooshing noises] It's awesome.
Stuart: Are you Matrix-ing over there?
Griffin: Yeah- yeah that was supposed to be Matrix-ing. Uh, what do you do?
Taako: So what d'you guys think we should do?
Griffin: This conversations happening-
Merle: [Wheezing] [Griffin laughing]
Taako: Okay, th- thank you.
Magnus: I- Maybe we should throw the balls... back at him?
Taako: Oh, I like that.
[Audience laughter]
Justin: I pick up a ball and throw it at the... skel-skelly.
Griffin: Uh, alright, do a ranged attack throw and add-
Justin: [yikes-laughter] First one of those bad boys. Let's see how this goes: Not great. Uh, ten?
Griffin: Uh, no you don't hit him with a ten.
Travis: Okay, I try it.
Griffin: Alright, you pick up a ball.
Travis: It's a... two?
Griffin: Jesus, guys! The wheels are falling off this-
Travis: It's hard to throw foam balls!
Clint: What'd you roll, Ben?
Stuart: I rolled a two... [Audience laughter]
Griffin: Jesus.
Clint: Eighteen! [Audience cheering, clapping] YES!
Griffin: Alright you throw a- you throw a foam ball at him and you hit him in the throat. And you hear him go
Skelly: [gurgly-choking noises]
Griffin: and he falls down to the floor. And you have-
Merle: Suck it, Skelly!
Griffin: And you have conquered Skelly the Skeletal Dragon.
Merle: You're welcome.
Stuart: I cast Healing Word on the skeleton.
Griffin: Awww.
Brad: Hey you- you did a really good job, Guy, don't worry about your throat. You heal, six damage.
Griffin: Alright, he stands up and says:
Skelly: Aw, man, thanks!
Griffin: And he starts throwing foam balls at all of you again.
[Audience laughter]
Brad: Guys, sometimes thems
Magnus: Brad-
Brad: the breaks, you know.
Clint: I cast Enhance Ability on Skelly the Skeleton.
Griffin: Okay? [Audience laughter][Travis: I punch Merle in the-] He starts throwing the balls at you much harder.
Skelly: Aw, man, I feel fucking awesome!
[Audience laughter throughout]
Clint: He's not throwing at me!
Griffin: [Makes rapid throwing noises]
Skelly: This fuckin' rules! Yeah! The power is unbelievable!
[Audience laughs]
Travis: I still have my shield, right?
Griffin: Uh, yeah. Alright, you block with the shield.
Stuart: I'm getting hit by balls.
Griffin: You're just getting hit by balls. Anybody wanna take initiative here?
Travis: I swing... Railsplitter at the guy in a costume? [Audience ooh-ing]
Stuart: What?
Griffin: Okay-
Justin: Let's- [Crosstalk]
Stuart: [Crosstalk] Oh my god.
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Yeah, no, roll a d20!
Travis: Non- Non-lethal damage.
Clint: Can you specify that?
Travis: That's a 19.
Justin: Oh no!
Travis: Plus 9, that's a 28.
Clint: So he non-lethally hits him for 28-
Travis: No, n- no that's not the damage.
Griffin: Yeah roll [laughing] damage.
Stuart: Yeah roll damage. Roll damage on this guy in a costume. [Audience & Justin laughing]
Clint: Who's a co worker.
Justin: [Laughing] Wait, okay wait, I need you to justify this from a character perspective. Why are you hitting a man with an axe? [Griffin laughing] They have a word for that and it's murderer.
Travis: To be fair, he's throwing shit at us. I'm hitting him with the blunt side.
Griffin: Okay, okay that works.
Clint: Oh yeah, that won't hurt him.
Travis: It's 11 damage.
Griffin: Okay, uh, where do you hit him?
Clint: In the nards.
Travis: [Strained] On the noggin.
Griffin: On the noggin? Okay-
Stuart: Woah, yeah, the- the soft spot.
Griffin: [Laughs] He f-
Travis: Listen, you're not asking Travis, you're asking Magnus.
Griffin: He falls to the ground like a sack of bricks. Uh, and you hear him go like:
Skelly: [Weakly] O-oh no... no, no, no, no, noo...
Stuart: I start prepping another healing word.
Skelly: I'm so proud of... your teamwork...
[Audience laughter]
Griffin: Uh, and with that you've beaten the fifth trial! And, uh, behind you, behind the dragon, I should say, another sort of fake, set, portcullis opens up, which opens up into a staircase leading up to the final chamber! Uh, and you come to a small room with a large wooden treasure chest with a bright light shining down from on top of it, but again you can kinda tell it's like a prop treasure chest, uh, that you might get at a Fantasy Target, or something, to decorate a dorm room, maybe? Uh, and yeah that's all that's in this room is this treasure chest.
Magnus: This sucks!
Travis: That's Magnus.
Griffin: Okay.
Art: Okay.
Clint: Was that a character voice?
Travis: Yeah,
Art: You gonna open the chest?
Travis: I open the chest.
Brad: I think we should open it all together, guys.
Griffin: Okay,
Taako: Yeah that's great.
Griffin: All four of you all at the same time- Are you on twitter over there Taako?
Taako: No, I was opening some Pringles.
Griffin: You, uh, you open up the chest and a spring loaded scroll pops out and unfurls, and the word ""friendship"" is written on the scroll. [Audience laughter] And a spurt of confetti comes out of the chest.
Brad: Magnus, Magnus d'you wanna read the scroll for everybody?
Magnus: ...It says friendship, Brad.
Brad: Kinda makes you think, right?
Griffin: You hear, uh- [Audience laughter & applause]
Griffin: You hear Art's voice say, um:
Art: You guys don't seem like you're having a great time in there. Can I ask what the problem is?
Magnus: It’s not... good test, I'm sorry Art.
Art: You don't seem like the Trial of Teamwork is like, engaging you really and teaching you lessons about-
Magnus: We've done a lot of shit together that was like way worse than this.
Art: Oh, this is too easy?
Magnus: Yeah,
Art: Well, why didn't you say so.
Magnus: Oh no.
Griffin: The ground beneath you-
Clint: Ooooooh god. [Audience laughter]
Griffin: -disappears. And all four of you somehow fall perfectly into a hole positioned, directly underneath you, and you're going down a long spiralling slide, a fully enclosed tube like a waterslide, and after, uh, a minute or so of sliding all four of you pop out of holes in the wall of a new room. It's roughly the size of the one that you were just in, but there's something different about it? The make of this room feels more authentic, like an actual dungeon, uh, you've been in dungeons before, this one feels more real and less like a set-
Brad: Wait, you guys have been in dungeons before?
Merle: Aw, yeah.
Magnus: We'll tell you about it when you're older, Brad.
Griffin: Yeah, I actually- Y'know what, I say that? This may be our first dungeon and that was our first dragon. We've done it.
Clint: We've never been in a dungeon.
Griffin: Uh, it has the familiar sulfur-y, dungeon-y smell, uh, you're- you notice some other things.
Travis: Yeah you get some some bleach in there, you can take that right out.
Griffin: You notice some other weird things. Brad, you don't notice anything in, in peculiar. Taako, you're standing up, but you feel like your vantage point is lower to the ground than usual. And Merle, the inverse is true for you, you're taller than you've ever been. And Magnus, you see Merle, and you see Brad, and you see yourself. I'm gonna need you guys to trade character sheets. [Audience cheering]
Griffin: Taako, you realize you are now Merle Highchurch, the Dwarven Cleric. Uh, Merle, you are now Magnus Burnsides, Human Fighter. [Travis: It’s magic!] And, Magnus you are now Taako, the Elven Wizard.
Travis: ...Should we trade costumes, too? [Griffin laughs]
Clint: I'll use any excuse to strip.
Travis: I'm gonna- That's true, that's how I got through college. Can I get those cards, please? I'll tell you about it when you're older.
Clint: I'm not gonna get any older.
Travis: Are you gonna die today!?
Griffin: Does everybody have their new character sheets? This is why I said to have all of your character sheets good and ready because other people are going to be using them. Are we all good to go?
Travis: Yes...
Stuart: I'm doing great.
Griffin: Yeah, Brad, you're still just Brad, still Brad-din’ it up
Stuart: Yeah just Brad-din’ it out.
Justin: I'm not wearing the hand but you can- I'm not wearing the hand but you can take it off if you want.
Griffin: How, uh, how do you all respond to b- So uh- I wanna make it clear-
Travis: [unintelligible] I immediately fire off a spell.
Griffin: Okay, what d'you- What do you cast?
Travis: I don't know. [Crosstalk] Dominate Person.
Justin: [Crosstalk] Hey d'you wanna- Well I wanna ask-
Travis: It was the first spell on the top of the pile.
Griffin: Alright, who do you cast it on?
Travis: ...Brad. [Audience laughs]
Griffin: Alright, because you've never cast magic before in your brain, you do have a magical body and this magical staff, you manage to cast it. It doesn't last very long, but you do definitely control the mind of Brad for like 2 seconds, uhh, and Brad that's not a good feeling I don't think.
Clint: Make him cuss, make him say something really dirty.
Travis: He says ""fart.""
Brad: Fart.
Griffin: Alright. [Audience laughs]
Griffin: I figured that this would be about 5 minutes of the show, does anyone else have anything they wanna do with anybody's bodies.
Justin: Hey- D'you wanna wear my hair?
Travis: Yeah. D'you wanna wear mine?
Griffin: Uh, Taako, uh, or I should say Merle, how do you respond to being out of the Taako body and into the Merle body, Justin.
Justin: Uhh, what am I?
Griffin: You're Merle.
Justin: [Taako voice] ""UUGH-"" Wait, do I have a character voice?
Griffin: Yeah, I think so- [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Sometimes-
Clint: [crosstalk] Don't use it, though.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Same character voice, coming out of different bodies.
Taako as Merle: [Proper voice] UUGH, I can't believe I'm so short, I hate this! [Audience laughs] Oh by the way, I look amazing. Look at my hair and my cool pointy hat! I never really appreciated how beautiful I was when I was in my body, and now that I'm in this misshapen lump, this aberration, this body that God forgot, [Griffin & Audience laugh] this sin, this living sin against aesthetics, [Griffin & Justin laugh] that is- that is Merle Highchurch, I- I really appreciate me so much more.
Griffin: Uh,
Clint: I am so changing my will.
Travis: That's not my voice.
Griffin: Yeah Magnus how do you, er- Dad, how do you, Merle, like being in Magnus' form? [Silence]
Griffin: Alright.
Clint: What is your voice?
Griffin: It’s gruff. It's like a gruff boy.
Travis: It's manly and gravely and gruff.
Clint: Um, uh, [laughs] oh no, I can't- yeah, uhm. [Magnus voice] I look down, and I guess I've been swimming.
Griffin: Aw man, he did a wiener joke on you! [Audience laughs]
Travis: That's not- Listen-
Clint: Did you hear all the shit he said about me!
Travis: Listen, I'm just gonna say, that's non-canonical.
Griffin: Magnus,
Justin: [Taako voice] Well, I will say one- [voice falters] one-
Travis: That's not your voice.
Griffin: Hey Justin, use your fucking character voice, dog.
Clint: Yeah! Get your character voice! Get your shit together! [Audience laughs and cheers]
Magnus as Taako: Use your character voice!
Justin: Oh, that's better, that's more like-
Taako as Merle: I'm putting these Pringle calories in your body, but I'm getting all the Pringle eating satisfaction myself! It's the grandest illusion of them all.
Griffin: And, uh, Magnus, I imagine you enjoy your magical capabilities, it's all you, really.
Magnus as Taako: I'm having a great time!
Griffin: Okay, uh, let's move on to the first trial of this new trial chamber. You step in and it looks familiar, except again like, it looks real- it looks like a real dungeon. And it's um, it's kinda warm in here and it doesn't take you long to realize what the source of that heat is.
Immediately in front of you is the balance beam trial you navigated earlier, five six and a half foot long planks of wood resting on metal poles that form a thirty long-- foot long zig-zag path, but there's no red carpet behind this-- underneath this path. Instead, there's a shallow trench, filled with glowing, steaming, molten rock. The floor is actually, literally lava.
Clint: Magnus rushes in. [Audience cheering & clapping]
Justin: As- as he's rushing in I cast Enhance Ability-
Griffin: Oh, shit.
Justin: -on that Magnus. Uh, I'm giving him Cat's Grace.
Griffin: Okay. I think that's +2 to acrobatics, so go ahead and roll, roll your roll. Are you just running across the whole span of the bridge?
Clint: Yes!
Griffin: Okay.
Clint: ...which one?
Griffin: The twenty-- one with the number tonty on it.
Clint: Wow, it really-- Nineteen! [Audience cheering]
Griffin: Yeah, you-
Clint: Plus! Plus, some other stuff...
Griffin: A shit-ton, yeah. You soar across the bridge, you easily make it across to the other side, of the gap.
Justin: Yeah I think Dad is well prepared to navigate someone else's character sheet. [Stuart laughs]
Griffin: Yeah.
Merle as Magnus: I'm Magnus!
[Audience laughs]
Clint: [crosstalk] You have a-
Travis: [crosstalk] That is my classic catchphrase.
Clint: [crosstalk] -you have a catchphrase, yeah.
Merle as Magnus: Magnus rules!
Griffin: Uh what's everybody else- what's everybody else doin'?
Travis: I'm gonna cast Levitate-
Griffin: Oh a- aw you- you're stealin'
Travis: -on Merle's body.
Griffin: Ohh, okay. So that's T-t-Justin. Okay, Justin, uh, you, Merle, are now floating in the air!
Travis: And, push him over the thing.
Griffin: Alright,
Taako as Merle: Wheeeee.
[Stuart & Audience laughing]
Griffin: Alright, that just leaves you, Taako, and Brad.
Travis: And I'm gonna cast Phantom Steed-
Griffin: Oh, shit! [Audience cheering & Clint laughing]
Griffin: No, wait! Don't clap yet! How is a horse gonna help you, phantom or not, how is a horse gonna help you do this?!
Garyl: Yooo.
Griffin: Alright, suddenly right in front of you is this spectral stee-
Magnus as Taako: I need you now more than ever, Garyl!
Garyl: Th- First off, I'm not fooled. Second, I know that's you. Second, this seems like a misuse of my skills.
[Audience laughter]
Garyl: Did you know h-
Magnus as Taako: We're gonna jump in together!
Griffin: You're jumping--
Garyl: You know horses, are kind of a distance thing. This is a small room.
Griffin: So, you're gonna make Garyl jump 30 feet-?
Travis: I'm just so excited to have magic.
Griffin: O-kay. You mount up on Garyl's spectral back and- What are you doing? You jum- you jumping?
Justin: Should you mention- I mean I should clarify if you haven't listened before. Garyl is the world's most beautiful binicorn, he's a unicorn with two horns and they're both rainbows and he's fuckin’- the best character in the whole thing.
Garyl: So what's up, what we doin'?
Griffin: Yeah, let's poop or get off the pot here, Trav.
Travis: Uh, I'm gonna cast Reduce on Garyl, and put him in my pocket. [Griffin & Audience laughing]
Griffin: Alright, tiny Garyl, what's that sound like?
Garyl: Yeah, fine.
Magnus as Taako: You're coming with me, Garyl!
Travis: And I run across the boards!
Griffin: [laughing] Okay, make a fucking acrobatics roll, you've just wasted so much time!
Travis: [rolls] ...that's a four! [Audience Ooh-ing]
Travis: Plus three,
Griffin: That is not- that is not adequate. Uh, you fall, make a-
Taako as Merle: Hey, that's my body, be careful, idiot!
Griffin: You make a dex save for me as you teeter off- you make it about halfway off the bridge and you lose your balance and go off the right side.
Clint: That's a twenty, he rolled.
Travis: That's a seventeen,
Griffin: Okay, you manage to catch yourself off the edge on the thing, you are now hanging off of the balance beam bridge, uh-
Magnus as Taako: I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one Garyl!
Garyl: Well that's- that's a real shame for you 'cause I'm a my little pony now. [Audience laughing] And you know how this shakes out.
Brad: Y'know, you guys are working so much better this time. What's going on?
Clint: He's dangling over a pit of lava.
Griffin: [laughs] Yeah, he's really dangling over lava.
Stuart: I start walking over the bridge,
Griffin: Okay.
Brad: Hey, you need a hand there buddy?
Magnus as Taako: I do!
Stuart: I reach down to give him a hand.
Griffin: Make a-
Travis: I use the Umbra Staff to do Feather Fall on myself.
Stuart: Into the lava?
Clint: You're gonna fall into the lava!
Travis: No no no, it makes me really light so he can pick me up.
Griffin: Yeah, I think it makes him lighter. Alright, so roll a, uh, ac- what would be lift-? I guess a strength check with advantage, 'cause you're also kinda keeping your balance?
Stuart: [Breathes in] Not really good at that.
Griffin: Well, you have advantage so you can roll 2 'cause he's made himself very, very light. [Stuart rolls] Oh boy.
Stuart: Sixteen.
Griffin: Okay, yeah, you get him back up onto the bridge and then the- all of you have crossed the bridge to the other side. You just got your life saved by Brad.
Stuart: I pat him on the butt.
Griffin: Okay. [Audience cheering & applause]
Justin: Brad files a report on himself.
Clint: Inappropriate touching.
Griffin: We're at trial two. Uh-
Magnus as Taako: You've earned this tiny horse, Brad!
Griffin: You give Garyl to Brad?
Travis: I did.
Griffin: Alright.
Stuart: I take Garyl, I say:
Brad: Hey Garyl, it's great to meet you, I'm a huge fan. I've heard all about you.
Clint: Oh Garyl’s not gonna put up with that shit. [Silence]...I guess he is-
Garyl: Yo, yeah, that's cool, it's so good to meet you too.
Brad: Can I get a picture with you after this? I know it's a little weird, but-
Garyl: I only last an hour, my dude. Let's see how quickly these dipshits pull through.
Griffin: Uh, you are standing in front of another fifteen foot high wall, uh, this one is metal, not wood, and, uh, it's- it's not totally smooth, though. It's got these small circular cutouts that are just shallow enough to get kind of a finger hold in.
Um, so it's gonna be tricky to climb up this thing, but it's doable, but in front of the wall are two small crates and sitting on top of each one is a strange apparatus that looks like two belts attached by a ten foot long cord, uh, and they look like a pair of belt handcuffs essentially and there's two of these, uh, and, uh, there's one pair of these tethered belts on each box, and you hear Art say:
Art: Before attempting that wall, you need to choose a partner. Choose wisely because this is not a trial where you wanna work with dead weight!
Stuart: I jump forward, and look at you all expectantly.
Griffin: Oh my god.
Taako as Merle: I think Brad should go with Taako. He seems like the only competent one of the four of us.
Brad: I guess it's just you and me Magnus.
[pause]
Justin: Wait-
Griffin: Wait, this is getting very confusing.
Justin: Wait this is getting so fucking confusing.
Griffin: So you are teaming up with Taako's body?
Stuart: I- wait- maybe? No, I was teaming up with Magnus' body.
Griffin: Okay, you're teaming up with Magnus' body, [crosstalk] that has Merle in it.
Justin: [crosstalk] No- I- Brad-
Griffin: Holy shit. Start over, who's teaming up with who in this?
Justin: Okay, Ma- Merle-body said Taako-body should go with Brad-Brad,
Stuart: Oooh.
Justin: 'Cause Brad- 'cause Merle-
Griffin: Two people raise your hands right now! That's one, that's two. We got it, there it is. [Audience cheering] Taako and Brad are Team #1. Uh, you all strap on these belts and you are tethered by a ten foot long cord. What are you- let's get up that wall.
Travis: Cool. I cast-
Magnus as Taako: I cast Animate Objects, and I animate the wall!
Griffin: To do what?
Travis: To carry us up!
Griffin: ...Oh god. [Audience laughter & Travis chuckling]
Clint: It's very Roger Rabbit.
Griffin: Okay, no, let's do this because we've gone so long. Uh, gross, metal hands like that one super creepy scene in The Labyrinth, [Travis: Yup] just kinda like- [Audience laughter]
Travis: [goofy voice] Do you guys wanna ride?
Griffin: Uh, you ride up and-
Brad: It's really comfortable, guys!
Griffin: The two of you have made it on top of the wall and as soon as you get to the top, your belts fall off and you are untethered and you have cleared the trial. Uh, Merle and Magnus- [Audience cheering]
Clint: I grab- [Loudly] I grab-!
Justin: [crosstalk] No, no, nope, no, no.
Travis: [crosstalk] He's not louder-
Griffin: [crosstalk] He doesn't just yell all the time.
Justin: No you wouldn't- if you wouldn't [crosstalk]
Clint: [crosstalk] Got it- to go a little raspy-?
Justin: Like, okay, let me show- lemme give you an example. 'I pat my Dad on the shoulder.' Like, I don't have to do that, I just patted you on the shoulder. So like you can just say that normally.
Clint: Okay so when I talk about what I'm doing I can just do it- I can just do it normal.
Justin: Right, you just do it normal.
Griffin: What are you guys gonna do to get over this wall, by the way?
Clint: [Merle voice] Okay, I, uh..
Justin: What the fuck.
Travis: Now you do that voice.
Justin: Die a thousand deaths.
Clint: I rush over and I grab Merle's short, but really well sculpted body. [Audience laughs]
Griffin: [laughs] Sure,
Clint: And I notice he's been workin' out-
Griffin: Excellent, excellent, excellent.
Clint: And I throw that lil' pecker right over the wall
Griffin: Are you putting on the belt?
Taako as Merle: Wheeee.
Griffin: Are you putting on the be-
Clint: Yes!
Griffin: Okay, you have the belts on, and you throw him up, ten feet, and then the cord snaps and it pulls you forward and the you smash into the wall and then he falls ten feet. And both of you take, 7 points of damage. [Audience laughter]
Clint: ...But it was funny, right?
Griffin: It was super fucking funny,
Clint: It wa- It was pretty funny, if you admit it.
Brad: Yeah, le- let's call that one a rough draft, guys.
[Justin & Audience laughing]
Justin: Okay, uh, lemme try-
Clint: So I'm dead now, right?
Griffin: No, you're not dead.
Travis: You're in my body.
Clint: Oh Magnus-! Oh, okay.
Travis: I have a lot of hit points.
Clint: Okay, smartass, what're you gonna do?
Justin: Uhm, I'm gonna turn around to the wall,
Griffin: Yeah,
Justin: And I'm gonna cast Flame Strike on the wall.
Griffin: Shit, okay.
Justin: Yeah. ""A vertical column of divine fire roars"" [starts to laugh] ""from the heavens in a location that's specified.""
Griffin: Guys, they're standing on top of the fucking wall! [Audience laughs]
Justin: Wait, we are trying to get to the top, aren't we? Let me try again.
Griffin: No, I mean, you gotta do it now.
Justin: I don't have to do anyth- Okay I f- fire the ceiling, I'm like:
Taako as Merle: Hurhur, good job guys, let me try another spell.
Justin: And I pro- I hope Art's office is directly above us, and just a column of divine flame just shot through his floor.
Griffin: Okay,
Clint: Do I really have a spell like that? [Audience laughing and cheering]
Justin: Alright, I'm gonna summon the one person that can help us.
Clint: Aw, good.
Justin: Della Reese.
Clint: Della Reese.
Griffin: Okay, [Audience cheering] I'm gonna- I'm gonna get through this quickly. You summon a guardian angel that looks like Della Reese and she gives you a comforting hug and then- I think, grabs you by the tethering cord?
Justin: That's a thing, and it picks us up.
Griffin: Yeah, like- well, like, she picks you up by the tethering cord so you two kind of slap together like nunchucks or something.
Clint: Like those knockers you get at Myrtle Beach.
Justin: Like truck nuts. [Clint laughs]
Griffin: Like truck nuts, yeah. She turns you into living truck nuts and deposits you and she says, uh,
Della Reese: That was a waste of my time.
Griffin: And disappears! [Audience laughter]
Clint: We've been touched by an angel.
Justin: We've been burned by an angel.
Griffin: Heh, yeah, uhh, and, uh, you're onto the fourth challenge, uh, right? Oh, no the third challenge-
Brad: Guys, guys we haven't accrued any Teamwork Penalties this time.
Magnus as Taako: We're doin' great.
Griffin: Yeah you’re doing a good job.
Justin: And, except, maybe we killed Art earlier, so there may not be anybody left. Travis hit 'im with an axe, but not in the way you think.
Griffin: Uh, yeah, okay, the third- the third trial is trust falls. Only this time it's not a shrunk down wall, it is a fifteen foot wall, uh, and, uh, Art says:
Art: Let's do it right this time, maybe, please? Do it right this time? Do this one right this time and don't make it little and like, a joke, I worked really hard on this.
[Audience laughs]
Stuart: Um, can I do an investigate check to look for gum on the floor?
Griffin: Yeah, sure. [Audience & Clint laughs]
Stuart: [crosstalk] Oh, I totally see it.
Clint: [crosstalk] He's just got so much hair.
Griffin: He actually says, this'll be fun, he sa-
Stuart: Twenty-two.
Griffin: Uh, no gum. He says, uh,
Art: Actually we need to start out with a designated catcher. I don't want any of you guys to fall a bunch of feet so, Brad why don't you actually head down, uh, go down those stairs on the back of the wall and you can be the first catcher, how's that sound?
Brad: That sounds great, I'd love that.
Griffin: Alright, you go down those stairs and you are standing at the bottom of the wall, ready to catch a person.
Stuart: I have my arms out and say:
Brad: You can do it, Taako.
Travis: That's me.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: I-
Magnus as Taako: I fall!
Griffin: Alright, so as Taako, uh, puts his back to the ledge and starts to fall backwards, right as he starts to fall backwards, you see a hatch open up in the back of the wall, and it reveals this pedestal with a beautiful, shining ruby on it. And it's right there, right in front of you, as Taako falls through the air.
Stuart: Wait a- a ruby for me?
Griffin: Just a beautiful ruby, directly in front of you that opens up like a little prize hatch.
Stuart: That's really tempting, I love rubies.
Clint: Yeah, get the ruby.
Stuart: I forgot to mention that about Brad, Brad is crazy for rubies.
Clint: Well he's a winter, and they look good with his complexion.
Stuart: Thank you!
Justin: I feel like Taako definitely cast Feather Fall with the Umbra Staff.
Griffin: Oh, no no no no no, we're not retconnin' that.
Justin: I definitely did, didn't you?
Griffin: Brad, what do you do, do you keep your positsh'?
Stuart: I keep my position, and I start humming Arms Wide Open under my breath. [Clint & Griffin laughing, Audience clapping]
Travis: And when I land in his arms I say:
Magnus as Taako: Hello my friend, we meet again. It's been a while.
Stuart: I res- I resist the urge to give him a little friendly kiss on the cheek.
Magnus as Taako: You can do it if you want to, I don't mind.
Brad: It's against regulations for HR.
[Audience laughs]
Magnus as Taako: Okay.
Griffin: I- I'm gonna say because you sang a bar of a Creed song, you used your bardly powers to empower yourself and catch him easily and not have to make a roll for that one. Uh, who's doing next?
Taako as Merle: Me. I jump off.
Justin: Y'know, uh, not for nothin' but his spell cards are largely useless.
Griffin: [Laughing] Okay,
Clint: Thank you!
Justin: Like, I- I tried to look for one, they're not very good.
Clint: Yes, thank you very much!
Justin: No, unless you need to heal people. I mean, you could deffo- you could deffo do that, for sure, like a ton.
Griffin: Uh, okay-
Clint: Well, I haven't seen you heal anybody!
Justin: [whispering] Nobody's gotten hurt yet, Clinton.
Clint: We've been gettin' hurt all over the place!
Griffin: We've gotta- we've gotta pick up the pace just a little bit, we're almost done.
Justin: So I fell, so I fell: [fart noise]
Griffin: Okay, uh, you fall off the back of the platform, same thing happens, Merle- uh, um- Taako, only this time you see it, the hatch in the wall opens up and and uh, uh, there's a beautiful, shining gemstone inside of it.
Taako as Merle: Grab it! Grab the gemstone, Taako, you can do it! I'll be fine, my body's made of rubber.
Clint: He can always- he can always heal himself.
Travis: But the thing is-
Taako as Merle: I can!
Travis: This is interesting 'cause I feel like, the Taako body instinctively reaches for it? [Griffin laughs] But like the Magnus mind is like 'I don't care?' and, um, uh, so do I need to do like a battle with my own body?
Griffin: Uh, [crosstalk] I think, I think-
Stuart: [crosstalk] Yeah, what does he roll to battle his own body?
Griffin: I think you can just say whether or not you do it.
Travis: Nah.
Griffin: Okay, yeah, you stand in place and you catch- you catch... Merle as he falls off the wall, and Magnus you're the only one still at the top, what d'you do?
Clint: I, uh, I fall,
Griffin: Okay,
Clint: But as I fall, in really cool, action movie style-
Griffin: You're just supposed to fall backwards, it's a fucking trust fall.
Clint: I- I flipped before. You let me flip before.
Griffin: Okay, you're right, you did it bad though, and you got a teamwork penalty.
Clint: Well, I was gonna stick a dagger in the wall and let it slow me down.
Griffin: OKAY, COOL.
Travis: It's a metal wall!
Clint: It's your body! You do shit like that all the time!
Travis: You're right.
Griffin: Okay make an- make an attack roll on the wall then.
Travis: It's a great body.
Justin: Oh, wait, am I catching him?
Griffin: Uh, not now. [Audience laughs]
Justin: Okay, I- I cast Zone of Truth on myself. [Clint laughs]
Taako as Merle: You're fucked!
[Audience laughs]
Clint: But I do thank you for using Zone of Truth. Zone of Truth is a copyrighted feature.
Griffin: Of Dungeons and Dragons. Of Wizards of the Coast LLC.
Justin: A subsidiary of...
Clint: I rolled- I rolled a two...
Griffin: Okay. Ping! Like, your dagger just bounces off of it, and you fall, and you're way out of position to be caught, and-
Travis: I pop him with- with Feather Fall.
Griffin: Oh, okay, you hit him with Feather Fall, uh, and this gives you- uh, the three of you a longer than normal window, you see this hatch open up and there's a beautiful, shining red ruby inside.
Justin: You know I grab-
Magnus as Taako: Don't fucking touch it, Taako!
Justin: [laughs] You're gonna have to stop me. I reach in and grab the-
Travis: No, I'm gonna use Dominate Person.
Justin: Okay, [Audience laughing]
Griffin: Jesus.
Travis: He must succeed a wisdom saving throw.
Griffin: Alright, make a wisdom saving throw, uhh, Merle.
Justin: Nat 20, fuck you!
Travis: Fuck! [Audience cheering]
Justin: NOTHING STOPS ME FROM GETTING RUBIES THAT I DESIRE.
Griffin: Alright, yeah, Merle you reach in and grab this ruby and nothing happens, you just have this beautiful ruby, [crosstalk] and it's worth a thousand gold pieces.
Justin: [crosstalk] Hell yeah! It always pays!
Griffin: It's one thousand gold pieces and I guess, Merle has it?
Clint: That's right, stick it in Merle's bag!
Justin: I go over and put it in Taako's bag, [Clint: Why!?] and then- wait, is Zone of Truth still effective-?
Griffin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Justin: Okay:
Taako as Merle: That was awesome, I don't regret anything!
[Audience laughing]
Griffin: Uh, you fall to the floor, Magnus, but you had Feather Fall on so you- it was fairly harmless. Uh, fourth trial, we're almost done guys I promise.
Clint: I take my bag and I give it t- to... Merle...
Griffin: J-Jesus. Uh, okay,
Travis: I'm not gonna take it, 'cause you're trying to give it to me from my body. Wait-?
Justin: Moving on.
Griffin: Aw man, we can't get stuck in the weeds again. I don't wanna have to re- reboot you a third time.
Clint: I give it to Barney.
Griffin: Uh, You make it to the fourth trial, [Audience laughing] You guys make it to the fourth trial which is the Totem of Constructive Criticism, and in place of all four of these heroes, are four fucking skeletons, and here's why. Not a single one of you followed the constructive criticism that you offered the person whose body you currently inhabit, from the first round of trials. [Audience & Clint Ooohing]
Clint: Oh, it's like a twist.
Griffin: Taako you were casting spells like fucking crazy, Merle you didn't heal anybody, Magnus you literally rushed into the first trial, Brad you didn't tell us-
Justin: Okay, now wait now wait now hold on-on-on-on, I did Enhance his abilities, which is like pre-healing, to save myself from healing him later.
Griffin: That's a good point.
Justin: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, my dude.
Griffin: Alright, Audience- Audience poll, who thinks that M-Merle passed his own constructive criticism? [Audience cheering]
Griffin: And who thinks he failed?
Justin: Aw f- [Audience cheering louder & Clint laughing]
Justin: Suck my dick, seriously. [Griffin laughing] Fuckin' a-hole- [mockingly] 'I love The Adventure Zone!' [normally] Do you? I'm not so sure.
Griffin: Uhh, and Brad you didn't tell us anything more about yourself, really.
Travis: He loves rubies!
Stuart: No, other than- than I love fucking rubies, dude.
Clint: Yeah, we learned that!
Griffin: Uh, al- all four of you take 19 points of necrotic damage [Justin laughing] as black energy pours out of the statue and sort of encompasses your body.
Brad: Y'know, I deserve that, actually.
[Audience laughing]
Griffin: Uh, we are on to the final trial, and you are standing in front of the entrance [Stuart: [quietly] I don't know where it went..] to a-- Do you not have a pen? Here, here.
Travis: It's okay, It's not my character sheet anyways.
Griffin: Uh, you're standing in front of the entrance to the arena again, only it's very real this time, it's not paper-mâché walls, it is a real, scary looking, cobblestone arena. There's blood splashes on the wall, there's some skeletons chained up by the entrance, uhh, it's- it's a pretty scary scene-
Stuart: Are they- are they dead skeletons or are they like, wiggling around? [Audience laughter]
Griffin: No, these are dead skeletons.
Travis: That's a fair question! [Audience laughing]
Griffin: No these are dead- these are the skeletons of the dead variety.
Travis: Thank you.
Stuart: I say:
Brad: Guys, guys, guys, let's huddle up real quick.
Magnus as Taako: Okay,
Brad: I think we can do this one, we've been doing great so far, uh, Magnus, Taako-
Clint: What podcast are you listening to?
Travis: Y'know what, here's- wait, nope, that's not my voice...
Brad: No matter matter how many times we get knocked down, we pick ourselves back up. Y'know what you guys all get? A dice of Bardic Inspiration.
Travis: Cool!
Stuart: So take one eight sided die and you get to roll it sometime when you need an extra eight sided die to add to something.
Magnus as Taako: Okay, fantastic.
Clint: I'm gonna- I'm gonna switch to bard.
Taako as Merle: Fantastic.
Stuart: It's called using the rules, guys.
Magnus as Taako: Um, here's what I'm gonna do, [Griffin: Okay] I'm gonna work with my team, because I don't know what the shit any of my spells do. So Taako, you tell me what spells to use when.
Griffin: [Laughing] That's good.
Taako as Merle: [Using the wrong voice] Okay. You already got Garyl, right?
Travis: Wait- who are you?
Justin: Wait- [combining the voices] I'm a hybrid. [Griffin & Audience laughing]
Griffin: He is the Daywalker!
Justin: I'm a terrible Island of Doctor Moreau style abomination. Uhm. I can't play, two characters at once. [Griffin laughing] I mean admittedly it would still be better than Dad, but- [Audience laughing]
Clint: I had nothing to do with this conversation!
Taako as Merle: Listen guys, we don't do a lot well, but the one thing we do dell- do do well, I think we can do well here. And that's beat ass. Let's beat some ass!
Justin: And I cast Mass Cure Wounds.
Griffin: Oh, okay! Everybody-
Clint: I had that spell?
Justin: Fuck you. [Audience laughing]
Griffin: Let's just say everybody's healed back up to full so we don't waste time rolling.
Justin: Hell yeah.
Travis: Yeah, that's some good DM-ing.
Griffin: Yeah, it is when you have- four minutes. Um, now we have a little bit- We started late, we can go a little bit later than, what, six... six?
Travis: Just keep going.
Griffin: Dinner's at six-thirty, we're good, okay. Uh, you charge into the battle after that cool catchphrase that I completely stepped on by checking on time for a minute there, uh, and you are in the arena, only it is not clowntown this time.
It is, uh, pitch black, the door shuts behind you and this time you can't seem to get it open, and the sconces on the wall burst into bright, green flame, which illuminate the arena and you see you're standing on a big pile of bones, that make it kinda tricky to walk around. Twenty feet, or so, in front of you, a massive ribcage emerges from the bone pile, and then two big skeletal wings, and then two large claws forming the shape of a real skeletal dragon, only it doesn't have a head, there's no head on it. You hear Art chime in and say, uh:
Art: Now, uh, let's tally up those teamwork penalties.
Griffin: And then suddenly three skulls attached to three long, bony necks emerge, sort of flanking, uh, the body of this skeletal dragon. One for each teamwork penalty you're incurred so far.
Magnus as Taako: Go get 'em Brad!
Griffin: And, uh, all three heads, uh, roar, ready for battle and, with your permission, I think let's not do initiative, let's just- one of you guys take an action and then I'll take an action and we'll just go back and forth.
Travis: Freeform.
Griffin: Freeform, baby, jazz.
Justin: Uh, okay, as requested, Trav, here's the spell you should cast on Taako's body-
Griffin: Do this in character- No you gotta do this in character, you're yelling, as Merle, to Taako.
Travis: Got it.
Taako as Merle: Taako, quick, cast this on yourself!
Magnus as Taako: I cast Greater Invisibility on myself.
[Audience laughing & cheering]
Griffin: Okay,
Taako as Merle: Excellent.
Griffin: Taako, poof!, vanishes.
Clint: I think you have Feign Death in there...
Griffin: Um, that means I have an attack, now. Uh, the, uh, body of the-
Travis: Wait hold on, that was just an action. And then I run underneath the dragon, invisible.
Griffin: Okay, you're inside of the dragon's ribcage.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay, uh, the dragon does not see you do that, obviously, 'cause this body doesn't have a head, but with its claws it's going to swipe at Brad.
Stuart: Okay. [Silence]
[Scattered chuckles from the audience]
Clint: Brad, obviously a crowd favourite.
Griffin: Um, that's- that's a-
Stuart: Y'know, it's fine, it's cool.
Griffin: Seventeen versus AC, Brad.
Stuart: Uh, my AC is 11.
Griffin: Jesus, Brad! What is- Can I ask? What's Brad wearing? This?
Stuart: Basically this, yeah. I have a clipboard.
Travis: You're a protection fighter.
Griffin: Uh, he hits you, and sort of rakes you across the chest and you fall backwards, and you take 14 points of damage, [Stuart: Okay,] and your fucking clipboard? [makes whooshing noises] goes flying into the bone pile.
Stuart: I loosen my tie.
Brad: Now it's Brad's time to shine.
[Audience cheering]
Griffin: Alright, Brad. Whatchu got?
Stuart: I say:
Brad: Bra- uh, Dragon. Focus on me, focus on me.
Stuart: And I keep pointing at my eyes and I keep pointing at his ribcage and I cast Compel Duel. So it can only- It has to pass a wisdom saving throw, and if it fails, it can only attack me. 'Cause I'm standing up for my buds!
Griffin: Okay, [Audience cheering]
Griffin: Yeah, he rolled a 9, which is okay news I guess?
Brad: Simmer down, you gotta focus on me, man.
Griffin: Okay, uh, with that I need-
Brad: Are you mad 'cause you don't have a head, ribcage-dragon-thing?
Griffin: Oh, you're talkin' a lil' bit of smack, now?
Brad: I don't know, I think that's an honest question. Y'know, when I was-
Griffin: [laughs] Okay, okay, okay. Uh, sss-Magnus. Dad. Make a dexterity saving throw.
Clint: I haven't done anything yet.
Griffin: Yup.
Clint: Oh, it's a five... and I add-
Griffin: Oh, Jesus. Doesn't matter. Uh, two of the dragon heads shoot a beam of green flame at you, hitting you for 21 points of damage.
Travis: I've got lots of health.
Clint: Not anymore.
Griffin: Who's doing somethin'? We're so close!
Travis: Uh, yeah you go.
Justin: Go ahead. I, uh, see this incredible sacrifice that, uh, what's-his-face did- [Griffin laughs]
Stuart: Brad.
Justin: Uh, Brad, that's right. Uh, and I cast Spiritual Weapon. I'm gonna create a flowing- I rush over to Brad and I create a- In front of him- and I create a floating spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration, uh, let's see, uh, on a hit the target takes force damage equal to one d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
Griffin: Can I make a requ- Do you- Do you know what the Spiritual Weapon’s gonna be?
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Okay. What is it?
Justin: Uh, it's- it's like a... um... it's a, umm...
Griffin: Fuck. So you didn't have an idea of what you wanted it to be?
Justin: I didn't have an idea.
Clint: Meat tenderizer!
Griffin: Can it be- can it be, uh, his clipboard, but beautiful and glowing and magical like a shield that you could use as a weapon.
Justin: Yes, I- yes, I see his clipboard, I'm so inspi-
Clint: That's what he has written, right here.
Justin: Yeah it says beautiful clipboard.
Griffin: O-okay, you have a new, magical, spiritual clipboard that you have, like Captain America's shield, that you can use as a weapon.
Justin: No, no, no, no, it's his mug.
Griffin: Oh it's his mug, that's even better.
Justin: It's hi- It's his giant mug, that he raises up and it's got like spikes and shit.
Griffin: And what does the mug- what does the mug say on it?
Stuart: It says ""Soar,"" and then defines it: ""To climb to new heights and achieve great things."" [Audience laughing & cheering]
Griffin: Okay,
Justin: And then I shout- [crosstalk]
Stuart: [crosstalk] I just gotta remind myself of that sometimes.
Taako as Merle: Soar on this, motherfucker!
Griffin: Uh, d'you wanna go ahead and use that- that weapon for an attack?
Stuart: I would love to use it as an attack.
Griffin: On one of the three heads, or the ribcage?
Stuart: On the ribcage.
Griffin: Okay.
Stuart: ...I roll a nine. [Griffin laughs]
Travis: ...teen?
Stuart: Nineteen.
Griffin: Uh, you have advantage on the roll because the weapon is so cool.
Stuart: Oh, uhhh, no, I got a fifteen.
Griffin: Okay, th- Yeah, that is enough, it's an unarmoured, just sort of bony ribcage. Uh, you bring this thing, this- this magical cup down and, uh, hit it, and uh, let's just say you break three of the eight ribs. That's how we'll track damage in this fight. [Audience clapping] Uh, and some of those bony shards rain down on you, Ma- er, Taako, invisible inside.
Travis: Uh, from within it, I point at two of the heads and cast Banishment.
Griffin: Oh, okay.
Clint: I- I am still playing, right?
Griffin: Yeah, d'you wanna take a- take a- just jump in, baby, it's freeform, it's like jazz up here, it's all about the turns you don't take! [Audience laughing]
Travis: The dragon heads have to, uh, pass a charisma saving throw.
Griffin: Oh, that's not their jam, no. Uh, fourteen?
Travis: What's your spellcasting modifier?
Griffin: Dad's not gonna know the answer to that- oh.
Travis: Better than that!
Griffin: Alright, yeah, two of the dragon heads just- Poof! Disappear!
Magnus as Taako: Abra-ca-fuck you!
Griffin: Oh, it feels good! [Audience cheering]
Griffin: Alright, you got one dragon head and a damaged ribcage. Why don't you take a turn Magnus-
Clint: Magnus rushes in!
Griffin: Fuck yeah, what're you doin'?
Clint: He takes, uh, old Railsplitter-!
Griffin: Okay,
Clint: -Is it Railsplitter?
Griffin: Yup. [Audience laughing]
Clint: And he- and he does it two-handed, because that's even more badass, and he runs up to the third dragon and he hits him on the C7- [Griffin: Okay,] Is that right? C7! Inspired by a tattoo-
Griffin: Roll that shit.
Clint: -And it's a seventeen, by god! [Audience cheering]
Griffin: Yeah. You cut-
Clint: Plus, I add nine to that, so twenty-six!
Griffin: You hit it- You hit it in one of its vertebrae and the whole neck- [Clint: C7!] -the C7, a dragon's natural weak point, um, you don't need to roll damage, the neck just sort of teeters over and the- the bony sort of structure just kinda falls apart, you've destroyed the third head. Uh-
Merle as Magnus: Chiropract that!
Clint: How's- is that good? [Audience laughter]
Griffin: It's- [crosstalk] It's good enough!
Travis: [crosstalk] That is my catchphrase!
Justin: Wait, Griffin, can you say it now? Can you say we- we solved it?
Griffin: Oh, no, there's still the ribcage, it's got claws, it's still attacking you-
Justin: Shiit.
Griffin: You haven't solved any fu- I'll let you know when the dragon puzzle's been solved, Justin.
Clint: You got something, don't you, you've got some in your hat.
Griffin: Uh, Brad, it looks like you've got somethin' you wanna do.
Stuart: Uh, I was waiting for it to attack me again because- I want-
Griffin: Okay, yeah, no, it's- this thing has not gone in a while, it definitely is gonna take another swing at Brad, um. Oh, shit, that's a critical hit.
Stuart: Okay. Guys, I think this is the end of Brad. [Griffin laughing & Audience ooh-ing]
Clint: Oh, well.
Travis: No, you have a thing!
Clint: I don't have a thing!
Travis: You're a protection dude! [crosstalk] You can force advantage!
Griffin: [crosstalk] The dice rolls weren't too bad-
Clint: [crosstalk] I- I cast Protection!
Griffin: No-! That's, no, that's done already!
Travis: Wha-
Griffin: You take nineteen points of damage, Brad.
Clint: [raspberry noise]
[Silence]
Stuart: Okay, I'm still alive.
Griffin: [laughing] O-Okay, I was- [Audience cheering] Uh, did you wanna ha-
Brad: You know, I'm sensing a lot of anger from you, Ribcage, um, does it stem from you not having a head?
Griffin: The ribcage kind of like- [nodding] Nods up and down like a-
Brad: Do I have to cast Zone of Truth on you, right now?
Griffin: It sits there and it taps its claws- [makes a ‘tktk’ noise] it goes- no, shakes its body left to right.
Brad: You're ready to express your own truth without magic, aren't you, Ribcage.
[Justin & Audience laughing]
Griffin: [laughing] I- it sits there for a second. It goes up and down: yes.
Brad: What's bothering you right now, buddy?
Griffin: [laughing] You see- you it's claws just go: [gestures with his hands]
[Audience laughing]
Justin: Griffin is indicating to his head, for those of you listening at home.
Brad: Guys, it's your- it's his head, he's missing his head.
Magnus as Taako: Oh, he's missing his head.
Stuart: I cast Calm Emotions on the ribcage.
[Audience laughing]
Griffin: Okay, what does that- does that do anything?
Stuart: Eh, it chills him out. [Griffin & Audience laughing]
Justin: [laughing] Okay- and then- and then, uh, and then Merle casts Flame Strike on the ribcage. [Audience laughing]
Griffin: [laughing] A-alright. Uh, I have to roll a dexterity saving throw, I think to get out of the way-? [Justin: Indeed.] Okay. Uh, that's a two.
Stuart: He's just way too chill.
Justin: Alright so here is... Six, three, one- so, ten- and then four.
Travis: [Adding along] Nine, ten, fourteen.
Griffin: Okay, fourteen points of damage. You take that, definitely, Taako, since you're inside of the ribcage that he just set on fire. Oh no, make a dexterity saving throw, I'm so-
Justin: And then four d6 radiant damage.
Griffin: Oh, Jesus.
Justin: Two, one, two, six.
Travis: [Quietly] Uh that's a, twelve, plus three, fifteen.
Clint: What the hell are you guys doin'?
Griffin: Sorry, what did you roll Travis?
Justin: [Quietly] So that's three, five, eleven.
Travis: Fifteen, which I think is-
Griffin: Okay, yeah, you dodge through the gap in the broken ribs that, uh, Brad made for you, and get out of the way of this flame strike.
Justin: And then, eleven radiant damage.
Griffin: Okay, it's weak to both of those types of damage, so this ribcage just explodes. [Justin & Audience laughing]
Griffin: Uh, and you have solved my Skeletal Dragon puzzle! [Audience cheering & whistling]
Griffin: Let's- let's wrap this up real quick. You- a portcullis opens on the other end of the arena, leading to a long staircase leading upwards and you reach another small treasure chamber at the end of the room. This one, again, real- like a dungeon treasure chamber, not like a movie set, um- And there's a ch-
Travis: Bra- Oh wait-
Magnus as Taako: Brad, you do the honours!
Griffin: And there's a treasure chest sitting right there.
Brad: I think we should do it all at once, guys.
Magnus as Taako: Okay, buddy.
Griffin: All four of you put your hands on the treasure chest and open it up-
Clint: And it explodes!
Griffin: And a wave of force emits from it, uh, knocking all of you backwards, and onto your backs.
Merle as Magnus: Good call, Brad,
Magnus as Taako: Goddammit, Brad!
Merle as Magnus: Really good job, Brad.
Magnus as Taako: Fuckin' dick-!
Griffin: And, you feel really weak, you actually all are incapacitated right now, I mean you can't take any actions,
Clint: [Quietly] Oh, you- oh,
Griffin: And Art's voice comes from the loudspeaker, and he says, uh:
Art: You all made this way too easy. Did you really not recognize me the whole time? Did you not recognize the face of the man whose life you ruined so long ago? Well I suppose it's not important now. I admit, this is a fairly circuitous method of getting my revenge, but it worked, didn't it? Goodbye, jerks.
Griffin: And the loudspeaker clicks off and spikes come out of the ceiling, and suddenly the ceiling is lowering down, to kill all four of you. Do you have any final words for each other?
[Silence]
Merle as Magnus: This is your fault, Brad. Smooth move, Ex-lax. I didn't wanna open the chest but nooo, [crosstalk] do it all together.
Travis: [crosstalk] That is not- that is not how Magnus sounds at all.
Stuart: [crosstalk] Great character voice.
Clint: He does now.
Griffin: Do you have any- any last words?
Magnus as Taako: [Sadly] I just wanna say- I've lost a lot- this is Magnus, but in Taako's- I wanna make that clear- And I- Okay- And I'm just glad that I found a new family! And I'm sad to lose this one too. [As if on the verge of tears?]
[Audience laughing/aw-ing]
Griffin: Aw... Anybody else-?
Magnus as Taako: Except for Bra- I mean we just met Brad, I think you're- You actually turned out to be not such a wang, and we probably could've been buds in another life!
[Audience laughing]
Justin: Taako just takes out the ruby he stole and cradles it like the old couple in Titanic. [Griffin & Audience laughs]
Clint: [Vocalizing] Neeaar, faar-
Griffin: Um, Magnus- Dad Magnus. Any last words- anything you wanna say to the crew before you're killed?
Clint: Um, I-
Merle as Magnus: I wish it hadn't happened!
[Audience laughing]
Griffin: [laughs] O-okay, and Brad, final words?
Brad: I had a really great time getting to know you guys this weekend, I had a lot of fun.
[Audience laughing]
Griffin: Uh, as you all finish your final words, just as the spikes from above are about to impale you, the floor disappears again, and you're falling through another set of four slides! And you're going down this- these slides for like a minute, and, uh, you- you emerge from the end of the slide, and you can see daylight, and you've emerged in that very first chamber, uh, that you first went into the dungeon, the one with the- the etching on the floor that reads: ""Enter colleagues, exit best friends."" And standing in front of you is Art Goodfriend! And you're back in your original bodies, you can tell you're back in your original- Oh we don't have time for-
Magnus: I'm back in my beautiful, big dicked body!
[Audience, Griffin, & Stuart laughing]
Travis: That is canonical!
Griffin: Uh, and Art Goodfriend says, uh:
Art: That's right! Y'all just got done dirty, like The Game starring Michael Douglas. I know my methods seem a bit harsh, but how good of friends are all you right now?
Stuart: I look at you guys, expectantly, waiting for you to say that we're great friends.
Taako: Um, one thing I did wanna tell you guys is: Does anybody knows who buys rubies around here?
[Audience laughing]
Griffin: [laughing] Um, anybody else have anything they wanna say?
Travis: I punch Art Goodfriend.
Griffin: Okay. [Audience laughing] Make an attack roll.
Clint: Wait, I cast Enhance Ability on him.
Griffin: Okay, yes, great! Uh, roll- gain- gain advantage on your roll!
Travis: Well, I- uh, fourteen, uh, yeah, so fourteen, with Phantom Fist, that's plus eight-?
Griffin: Yeah, you punch, you punch Art Goodfriend in the face, no need to roll damage. He sees you enhance his ability and he takes it and he, like, spits out blood-
Travis: And I say:
Magnus: That's for Brad.
Griffin: And he spits out some blood and he goes-
Brad: [Quietly] That's me...
Griffin: He sees you enhance his ability, you punch him in the face, he spits out blood, and he goes:
Art: Teamwork.
[Audience laughing]
Griffin: And that's the episode! Thank you all, for listening! Uh, this has been The Adventure Zone, I hope you liked it, and, uh, have a good rest of the Max Fun Con!
[Audience cheering & clapping]
[Music starts playing and plays until the end]
