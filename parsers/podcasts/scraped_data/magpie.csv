## intro
Welcome to Duskwall, and to the first episode of The Magpies podcast. I’m Rhi, your Game Master.
This is an actual play podcast using the Blades in the Dark roleplay system designed by John Harper. In Blades, the player characters are scoundrels and criminals in a corrupt, haunted, industrial fantasy city trying to claw their way to the top of the heap and securing enough wealth and power to one day retire into luxury. It’s a game of high risk for high rewards and leaping before you look.
A couple of things about today’s episode:
First, while this is the first episode, it isn’t the first game session. We played a couple games prior to this to give everyone time to learn a little bit about the rules, the world, and their characters. So, there are some references to things that happened in those first sessions, but nothing that should be too confusing and nothing that’s really plot critical.
Second, apologies for some of the audio issues. The roommates of one of our players decided to start having a very loud party a couple hours into recording. I edited around it as much as I could, but a bit still makes it in from time to time. Sorry about that.
Now then, let’s get started, shall we?
## [00:01:22]
Welcome to Duskwall.
It’s a city of many names. The Skovlanders who founded it called it Doskvol. The Akorosian cartographers who mapped the place called it North Hook. These days, most people call it Duskwall, or simply The Dusk.
It’s the jewel of the empire, a crowded, crushed city surrounded by barriers of lightning, home to the docks where the great leviathan hunters set sail to seek the demons whose blood fuels the empire. This is the year 847 of the Imperium, 847 years since the cataclysm that ended the world, that turned the sea to black ink and rearranged the continents, that shattered the sun and broke the gates of death, 847 years since the Immortal Emperor – may he reign a thousand lifetimes – ascended to the throne.
The people of this world are the descendants of those who survived its ending, and they are a people willing to do anything to continue to survive. And it is in this city and in this year that we find ourselves here, on a dark afternoon street in Duskwall’s Nightmarket district, outside a tavern favored by one of the city’s countless newly fledged gangs, another band of hopefuls looking to claw their way to wealth and power.
Will they be among the lucky few to succeed, or will they join the ghosts and the broken haunting the city streets? Only one way to find out.
##
RHI: It is late afternoon in Nightmarket in Duskwall, and we are starting off in the inside of the Hound’s Paw Tavern. You guys tell me, what’s the place look like, how crowded do you think it is now?
MADGE: I think it’s more crowded than it usually is, purely because we hang out there and people have sort of caught on to the fact that we might be a bigger deal than people thought.
RHI: Okay. Yeah, that’s true. You guys are starting to build up a little bit of a reputation. And, it is located near the dog racing tracks in Nightmarket, and I think you guys had said that it’s like decorated with the little jerseys that racing dogs wear, and they probably have like… I’m picturing framed sketches of the dogs that have the little ink paw prints on them as like an autograph.
KIM: Aww.
MADGE: (gasp) Oh my gosh.
JOSIE: Aww. It’s the world’s most adorable sports bar.
RHI: Yeah, yeah, it’s a very cute sports bar. So, it’s a little more crowded than usual. There’s a couple of wait staff delivering drinks. Your friend Rigney is at the bar. He is the owner of the tavern and a frequent source of information and jobs for you guys. He’s tall, very dark skin, dark eyes, really, really long black hair that is done in a bunch of these tidy little braids that hang down to his waist, and he usually has these brightly colored ribbons wrapped around and interwoven with his braids. You guys have only ever seen him wear pinstripe pants and vest and a button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up. They’re different versions of that outfit, but it’s always that same theme.
JOSIE: And bartenders are legally required to have their sleeves rolled up.
RHI: Yes, yes. And he always has a silk handkerchief in his pocket that matches the colors of whatever ribbons he’s got in his hair. And, so, he’s at the bar you know making drinks for people, chatting with a couple of other people who are at the bar, and the door swings open. Phin is leading the group in. what does Phin look like?
MADGE: She is an Akoros girl of around 25. She has a very stocky build, a round face. She has olive skin, her eyes are very, they match her face, they’re very round, they’re deep set, they’re gray. She has black hair that she’s cropped very close to her head, so like sort of like a page boy haircut. She wears a rough looking tunic. It’s probably got some holes in it. It’s definitely been through a few fights. There are some dark marks on there that might be dried blood but no one has asked.
(laughter)
And then she wears really, really sturdy work boots like the kind that you would see down at the docks. And then she also wears suspenders, and a long coat.
RHI: cool. So, Phin comes in and starts walking towards your usual table. After Phin, Minx comes in.
JOSIE: Minx is a pretty tall Akoros woman, probably around mid-twenties. She’s obviously dressed fancier and trying to project more of a noble air, but her clothes are not, like, mismatched, but most people versed in the subject can tell that they’re not nearly as high quality as an actual noble might wear. They’re definitely the clothes of someone being pretentious, essentially.
RHI: she bought them off the rack rather than having them tailor made for her.
JOSIE: Right, exactly. She totally bought these.
(laughter)
RHI: she GOT them off the rack.
MINNA: There we go.
JOSIE: But it is somewhat imposing in that a lot of the flowing or puffy parts are kind of pulled in, either just by being sewn in or having some sort of strap around it, and her left arm is clearly outfitted for dueling purposes, and she kinda has the one arm guard like the leather pauldron on her left shoulder. And she is much more, probably more smiley than anyone else in the bar at this point. Definitely walks haughtily.
RHI: Behind Minx is Blaire.
KIM: Blaire is a very small Tycheros child basically, she’s 19. She’s very short, she’s like 5’1”. She has medium toned skin and really messy, unkempt, dark brown hair. Her Tycherosi features are basically just horns and very pale, pupil-less eyes, pointed ears, stuff like that. She likes to just smear this really messy face paint like all over her eyes, just ‘cause. And her clothes, she has a dark gray, black motif going on with most of her clothes with a couple dashes of bright blue accents like an actual magpie would. And she keeps her spirit mask strapped to her back for easy access, and she has this really tattered black cape that kind of resembles feathers.
RHI: Cool. And then, bringing up the rear is Myra.
MINNA: So, Myra is somewhere in her early 20s, maybe 23 to 25. She doesn’t know her exact age. She is pretty spare figure, very austere clothing, dark sort of patchwork skirt and like a vest and shirt, all very practical. Curly dark hair pulled severely back. Large dark eyes, and she is probably one of the quieter of the group at times.
RHI: All four of you head over to your usual table which despite the larger than usual crowd remains open. Rigney kind of waves a hand at you as you come in, and you know that he’ll brig over your drinks in a bit, but he’s clearly pretty busy right now. So, the four of you sit down…
MINNA: “So where’d you come across that one?”
KIM: “What?”
MINNA: “Your limp. That’s new.”
KIM: “Oh! I just twisted my ankle.”
MADGE: “Oh.”
KIM: “What about you?”
MINNA: “A… bit of a gunshot.”
MADGE: “A bit? We did a…”
KIM: “Okay…?”
MADGE: “Okay. So, something you have to know is that we pulled off pretty much the biggest heist in our entire career, which is very short I’ll admit. It also went very bad.”
MINNA: “I wouldn’t say it went terribly. We did accomplish some of our goals.”
MADGE: “How much money did we get, though?”
JOSIE: “Not nearly enough.”
MINNA: “Maybe we didn’t get coin, but think about the gain in reputation. That’s important as well.”
JOSIE: “Which was our end goal with doing two in one night.”
MINNA: “Exactly.”
MADGE: “I mean, yeah. I was also sort of in it to stick it to the Billhooks, and a lot of good that did us.”
JOSIE: “And it was thoroughly exciting.”
MINNA: “That is very true. To catch you up, we made it look like we attacked two different gangs’ headquarters in one night.”
KIM: “Sheez.”
MINNA: “So, Billhooks and Grinders. We made a deal with Ulf Ironborn. It didn’t go as well as any of us had hoped, so that’s off for the future, but…”
KIM: “Well, you tried.”
JOSIE: “Also, there was a rather distressing amount of fire, but we did get it done.”
KIM: “Man, you guys did some really exciting stuff without me. It’s way more exciting than what I did.”
MADGE: “What did you do?”
KIM: “Uh, you know, the usual. Um, I met up with Dowler, and you I did some ghosty stuff, and you know twisted my ankle, and I made a friend. And he gave me this really weird stuff that I don’t know what it is, but I’m gonna look into it.” So, she’ll reach into her pocket and show the rest of the table.
RHI: Yeah, so it’s this really small, it’s organic, it looks like it’s some sort of wooden thing. It’s kind of rounded and smooth on the bottom, has sort of a knobbly kind of cap type thing on top. None of you have ever seen this before.
JOSIE: “Huh…”
MADGE: I poke it.
JOSIE: “What is this, some sort of seed?”
KIM: “I really don’t know. I mean, I imagine I’d have to like, I don’t know, maybe dissect one to really get an idea of what it really is, but I don’t have a lot of them. I don’t want to do that.”
MADGE: “Maybe we should burn it.”
KIM: “No! What would that accomplish? That would just put it into ash.”
JOSIE: “It might be best to plant it, dear.”
RHI: There’s a handful of places in this city where you can actually grow trees. You guys do not have access to any of them.
JOSIE: “Well, it had to come from somewhere, didn’t it?”
MINNA: “We don’t have the kind of money it takes to grow a seed.”
KIM: “And we don’t even know if this is really a seed. It could be, I don’t know…”
MINNA: “Perhaps there’s some old books you could find.”
KIM: “Yeah, I’m mostly just hitting the books right now until I can get a better idea. Oh, and I did find some really cool mushrooms. I got one. It glows.”
JOSIE: “Mm, delightful.”
RHI: “Ah, the glowing ones make a wonderful tea,” Rigney says as he comes over with a tray and hands out your regular drinks.
KIM: “Really? I need to know the recipe.”
JOSIE: “Does the tea glow?”
RHI: “It does.”
KIM: “Oh my gosh.”
MADGE: “What kind of amazing are we talking about, though?”
RHI: “The kind where you should plan on clearing your next 8 to 12 hours because you won’t be getting anything done other than staring into the distance.”
KIM: “That sounds awesome.”
JOSIE: “That does sound like a delightful evening of tea.”
RHI: “Well, it looks like all four of you are back together again. That’s good to see. There’s a, well there’s a lot of people here who are interested in you,” and he kinda glances around, and you do notice that there’s like a few clusters of people who seem to be sort of stealing glances at you and like talking to themselves. None of it seems to be hostile, they’re just kinda like, “Oh man, is that them?”
JOSIE: If I ever catch anyone looking at us, I wink at them.
MADGE: I wave at one of them.
RHI: Yeah, and people, when they realize that you’ve seen them, kind of get a little flustered and look away, kind of embarrassed that they got caught. “There’s actually a couple here who might be interested in contracting you for some work if you’re interested.”
KIM: “Work could be good. I didn’t get any coin last time I went out.”
RHI: “Mm, that’s a shame.”
KIM: “Well, I got some other stuff, but coin, you know.”
MINNA: “We could use a job.”
KIM: “Coin is good.”
RHI: “Alright, well, give me a moment, I’ll send ‘em on over.” So, he walks over to the bar and you see him talk to a pair of women who are seated there, speaks to them briefly, one of them nods and they both walk over to the table. The woman who reaches you first, she is an Aruvian woman, so she’s got warm, medium brown skin, very short black hair, dark eyes. The other woman, pale skin, long brown hair that’s done into a braid, blue eyes. Both of them are dressed in, kind of close to how Myra is dressed, decent clothes, a little worn, more practical than fashionable. As they come over the Aruvian woman begins signing in Imperial Sign Language, and the other woman starts translating. “Hello, you’re the Magpies, correct?”
MADGE: “Mm-hmm.”
RHI: “May we sit?”
JOSIE: “Of course.”
MADGE: “Yeah, no one else is coming.”
RHI: So, they pull over a couple chairs and sit down. Do you think any of you would have reason to have learned Imperial Sign Language?
JOSIE: I feel like Minx may have some experience in it just because she’s kind of a conversationalist type and would want to communicate with as many as possible. Like, it’s probably spotty, but…
RHI: So you’re not fluent.
JOSIE: Mm-hmm.
RHI: They both sit down and the Aruvian woman begins signing again and her companion is translating. “My name is Lani Sethiri and this is my partner and translator Roxanne Elpis. We are journalists with the North Hook Mirror.” And you guys know the Mirror. It’s one of the smaller papers in Duskwall, has a reputation for being a little more independent than a lot of the other papers which are basically run by the nobility. That’s not to say that it’s entirely free of corruption or outside influence, but it’s better than most.
Lani continues, “We’re working on a story, a big story, and we’ve run into a bit of a road block in trying to get information. We’ve tried all the legitimate channels we can, and well we’re hoping that you might be able to gain things a little less legitimately.”
PLAYER: “Mm…”
JOSIE: “Well that is our trade, but I suppose that would depend on what information you’re seeking.”
RHI: “A few days ago, a couple of my contacts in the Gondoliers were attacked and died of their injuries later that night. They were questioned by the Blue Coats before they passed away, and according to a source that I have there’s a report of what they said, but the Blue Coats aren’t pressing charges, they’re not doing any further investigation, and they won’t release the report to us. I have a suspicion about who’s behind the attack, but I need that report to confirm it so that we can keep digging into it more.”
JOSIE: “Oh, well that makes it somewhat more simple, an exchange of material for material. What material shall be coming our way?”
RHI: “Well, we can’t afford to pay you much. Journalists aren’t exactly the wealthiest in the city. We can pay you only 2 coin, but you can also, you know, if you’re getting into the Blue Coats station you might be able to liberate a few things out of evidence lock-up or wherever they stash all of their bribes, that could fill that out a little bit better. I understand that we’re sort of asking you to do this out of the goodness of your hearts, but we do need help.”
MINNA: “The question that interests me is: Who is it you suspect?”
RHI: The two of them sort of pause and exchange a look, and then they both kind of shift so that their hands are a little more blocked by their bodies so that anybody looking at you would have a harder time seeing, Lani says, “We believe it’s the work of a secret society called the Circle of Flame.”
MINNA: “Hmm…”
JOSIE: Do any of us know that?
RHI: None of you have heard of this group. You know like, secret societies in Duskwall are a thing, you know that there are some out there, there’s all kinds of cults and such things, but you haven’t ever heard of one called the Circle of Flame.”
MINNA: “And what is this Circle of Flame?”
RHI: “We don’t know much. We have reason to believe that their membership is fairly limited but very well connected, quite wealthy, powerful. From what we’ve managed to turn up it seems to be a society of antiquarians which mostly means that they’re doing work with the occult and other such unseemly things.”
KIM: “Cool.”
RHI: Roxanne doesn’t translate that, but she shoots you a look.
(laughter)
KIM: “I mean, not that I would do any of that stuff, but like—Sorry, it just sounds really interesting to me. I’ll shut up now.”
RHI: She translates that out slowly. Both of them are giving you a like, “Okayyy,” mildly suspicious kind of look, but Lani continues with, “I have heard about them first through the Gondoliers. Some of my contacts there had said that they had been the victim of thefts and intimidation from hired muscle connected to this Circle of Flame.”
MADGE: “We’ll take it.”
JOSIE: “Well, hold, hold a moment.”
KIM: “You don’t want us to go after spooky stuff?”
JOSIE: “No, I do want us all to have a good time, Blaire…”
KIM: (giggles)
JOSIE: “…but as payment for a task with, what it seems like, deeper running implications, 2 coin to split amongst ourselves is, and I understand you’re a journalist, there isn’t much to give, but that’s not a share we would normally go in on for a job. I understand if you cannot provide more, but since you were asking essentially a half favor for us to apply our trade, does it not make sense that you apply yours to our benefit at some point?”
RHI: Roxanne translates that out and they sign back and forth a little bit.
JOSIE: What are they saying?
RHI: Minx, you’re able to pick up that they’re talking about trading favors, not sure what we could do, talk to the Gondoliers, basically they’re trying to figure out, like, I’m not sure what we could do for them, but we’ll figure out something. And then Roxanne turns to you and says, “That’s agreeable. We can, if you should have some need of assistance from us we’ll do our best to deliver. We do have access to a fair amount of information archives if you ever need that sort of thing.”
MADGE: “You said that they were threatening people? Getting them to cough up money?”
RHI: “They didn’t seem interested in money. They were more interested in what the Gondoliers knew. There’s a lot of secrets lost to the canals of this city, and the Gondoliers have been sailing them for as long as the city has stood. From what I had been told prior to this attack, it seems like the hired muscle that was coming around to threaten them and question them was interested in those sort of things, asking about artifacts or rituals or spirits that they have seen.”
MADGE: Phin’s gonna lean back in her chair and cross her arms over her chest. “I’m never a fan of people coming around and throwing their weight around when they have no right to. That’s why I’m in. I’ll even give up my share of the coin if that’s the big worry.”
JOSIE: “Well, now that the scales have been balanced somewhat it seems like a task we can undertake.”
MINNA: “Could be a useful connection in the future.”
RHI: “So we, we have a deal?”
JOSIE: “Indeed.”
MADGE: Phin spits in her hand and holds it out.
(laughter)
JOSIE: “Phin!”
RHI: Lani just kinda looks at you, shrugs, spits in her hand and shakes.
JOSIE: “Well, alright then. I suppose no offense taken.”
RHI: The two women start to move back from the table as if getting ready to leave.
JOSIE: I’m going to sign at Lani, and not say it out loud… Essentially Minx is gonna flirt, she’s gonna extend an invitation, because if there’s one thing Minx knows how to do in every language it’s flirt.
RHI: So, you do that, and Roxanne shoots you the dirtiest look.
MADGE: Whoa…
JOSIE: (laughs) Oh shit.
RHI: Lani seems amused. Roxanne is instantly like, you fuck off.
JOSIE: Oh shit. How did I not pick up on that? Damn.
(laughter)
RHI: Well, they were not giving any indication. They’ve been very professional, but…
JOSIE: Uh-huh.
KIM: “Minx, what the fuck did you tell them?”
JOSIE: “I think as I just discovered, some things are best left unsaid.”
(laughter)
RHI: Lani just shakes her head and signs something to the effect of like, flattered but taken. “You can find us at the Mirror’s offices on Ink Row once you’ve finished. All that we need is that report. Anything else you happen to recover while you’re obtaining it is all yours. Thank you.”
MADGE: “Of course.”
JOSIE: “A pleasure.”
KIM: “You’re welcome.”
RHI: They stand up and head out, and Roxanne like shoots a glare over her shoulder at Minx, and then loops her arm through Lani’s.
JOSIE: I sign back a very meek “sorry!” (laughs)
KIM: “Daaamn.”
MINNA: “I think it’s probably information gathering time, right?”
RHI: The Blue Coat station in Nightmarket, which is actually not super far from where you guys are, it’s just kind of within the bounds of your hunting grounds, and that’s where the report is, but you guys have to figure out how to get your hands on it.
MINNA: I feel like Myra might be helpful going to one of her people. She does have a friend who’s a Blue Coat archivist who might be able to tell us a little about the station.
RHI: Where do you wanna, are you gonna meet with him in his little office as usual or are you guys gonna meet somewhere else?
MINNA: I think it’s fine just going to his office. People are used to me showing up there.
RHI: I assume you’re gonna roll Consort on this one.
MINNA: Yes.
RHI: Okay. So your highest is a 4, so that’s Standard. He’s in his tiny little office, and as you’re coming in what looks like a page, a young teen with just a huge arm load of books and papers comes out and nearly runs into you. “Oh, sorry ma’am,” and skitters off down the hall. Jeren is inside flipping through some books, quickly scribbling down notes. When you come in he glances up. “Oh, Myra, hi. What can I do for you?”
MINNA: “I’m actually after a little bit of information. I’m sure you’re very startled at that.”
RHI: (sighs) “You know, you could come see me when you don’t need things.” He’s smiling as he says it, but you can also tell, like, it’s sincere. (laughs)
MINNA: (groans)
RHI: “We’re updating all of the patrol routes in the city, and now some magistrate in Brightstone is protesting where the routes are being routed to, so we’re scrambling to try to reorganize them, and it’s—Anyway, sorry. What are you looking for?”
MINNA: “I just had some questions about the layout of the station down in Nightmarket. Don’t worry, we’re not gonna like attack it, we just… quick in and out, don’t worry.”
RHI: “I’d rather not know even that. I mean, it’s a standard layout. I have only been there a couple times and just, you know, to pick up reports and things.”
MINNA: “So you wouldn’t know the route there, to one of the doors?”
RHI: “Well, I mean, I don’t… Usually when I pick up reports from some place I just go to the front desk and tell them that I’m there to pick up a report, and I show them my badge, and then they send someone off and come back with a big satchel of papers, and then I leave.”
MINNA: “Could you make a guess at where it would be? Do you think the layout would be similar to here?”
RHI: “Well they don’t have a dedicated archivist there, so reports are probably with the chief, and then, you know, they would eventually get funneled up to me or one of the other archivists. You’re not gonna do anything that’s gonna get me in trouble, are ya?”
MINNA: “Nobody will know it had anything to do with you.”
RHI: “(sighs) “I sure hope that’s true.” There’s a, “Uh, uh, excuse me, miss? Excuse me,” and the page is trying to squeeze around you with an arm full of papers again. “Oh, yeah, just bring those over here. Is there anything else that you need, Myra?” He takes the papers and sets them down.
MINNA: “Nothing in particular. Thank you so much. We’ll arrange lunch sometime soon, right?”
RHI: “Uh… Once I get out of this, yes.”
MINNA: “How about this. I will bring you lunch, to your desk.”
RHI: “That would be wonderful. What time is it? Did I eat lunch today?”
MINNA: “Please go eat, Jeren.”
RHI: “Yeah, I’ll have someone get me dinner.” (sighs) “Good luck out there.”
MINNA: “Thank you.”
RHI: Alright, so, you head back out and you hear him calling the page back in, like, “get me a sandwich.” So, who’s investigating gathering next?
JOSIE: Well, I was just gonna survey the place.
RHI: You stroll the handful of blocks over to the Blue Coat station. Yeah, go ahead and, you said you were gonna Survey?
JOSIE: Yes, although what I would like to do is use my Rook’s Gambit ability to perhaps use Sway instead. I’m chatting people up to get information.
RHI: Okay, so that is a 4. So, asking around about sort of… tell me again what kind of information you’re trying to get, like patrols in the area, when people are on and off shift?
JOSIE: Yeah, exactly. I essentially wanna get a grip on what kind of resistance we’ll be facing.
RHI: Usually the way the patrols are set up they’re kind of staggered out, so you’ve usually got one or two squadrons leaving every couple hours. Like, leaving and coming back.
JOSIE: So the patrols could be ranging pretty far out?
RHI: yes, yeah. They’re sending out patrols to cover pretty much the whole district.
JOSIE: So, can I get the sense of an idea, like, what point in those two hours it would be best to execute on? Like, the most people are gone and they’re the most far out?
RHI: Probably in the middle. Nobody’s going to be coming back super soon, so if you wait until, you know, an hour after patrols have gone out then you’ll have about an hour before a whole bunch more people show up.
So, Phin and Blaire head off to… So, the way that Nightmarket is, and a lot of places in Duskwall actually are set up, is there’s kind of like the upper streets, the surface level streets, and then there’s a lot of subterranean streets running along the canals. So you guys head down to the lower streets, basically the closest public dock to you guys which is where the Gondoliers will hang out, you know, looking for fares.
MADGE: I definitely wanna pick the toughest looking Gondolier and sort of head over, lean against whatever like mooring post is there, and look up at them. “I hear you’ve been having some trouble around here lately.”
RHI: What skill are you rolling, or what action?
MADGE: I’m probably gonna be using Sway.
RHI: Blaire, are you gonna be doing anything, or are you just kinda hanging out?
KIM: I’m gonna see how this goes. I’ll probably, I’ll chime in if this goes badly.
MADGE: (giggles)
RHI: Well!
MADGE: (laughs)
KIM: Which… it did.
RHI: Yeah, you’ll be chiming in. So, the Gondolier you have selected, she is about six and a half feet tall.
MINNA: Oh no.
KIM: Oh shit.
JOSIE: Oh hey girl.
MADGE: (laughing)
RHI: She has some prison tattoos on her forearm.
KIM & MADGE: Oh no.
RHI: A really nasty looking scar down one side of her face, and she just looks over at you raises an eyebrow, and, “No trouble that we haven’t been able to handle. Thanks.”
KIM: “Listen, I’m just gonna cut right to the chase.”
RHI: She looks over, and then has to look down a considerable amount.
(laughter)
KIM: “We heard that a couple of your guys may have, uh, gotten into a little mix up a couple days ago. Do you know anything about that?”
RHI: “Why do you wanna know?”
KIM: “Well…”
RHI: “I mean, you two are obviously not here to try more of the same, because…”
MADGE: “Yeah, that’s not our thing.”
RHI: She looks at the two of you, and then looks at the three other Gondoliers that are standing there. They’re not getting involved in the conversation, but they’re watching.
MADGE: “Well, what I wanna know is what they looked like and what kind of information they were trying to get.”
RHI: “I don’t know. I wasn’t there.”
MADGE: “Do you know someone who was?”
RHI: “Yeah, the two guys who are dead.”
KIM: “Did you know them?”
RHI: “Yeah, I mean, we hung out at the docks around the same time every now and then. One of them was a guy who went by Slip, and the other was Solberg. I don’t remember his first name. El? Edwin? Alwin? Something ended in –win.”
KIM: “Okay.”
RHI: “Yeah, they were good at their jobs. Didn’t really ever have any run-ins with customers or any of these thugs that’ve been shaking people down.”
MADGE: “Well, if we have anything to say about it, people aren’t going to be shaking your people up anymore.”
RHI: “Oh, they haven’t bothered me.”
MADGE: “Well… You’re a mountain.”
KIM: “We obviously weren’t talking about you. I mean look at you, you’re ripped.”
MADGE: “You are physically impressive.”
RHI: (laughs) That actually, when Myra says that it actually finally gets her to like crack a smile.
JOSIE: Blaire is adorable.
KIM: (laughs) “I mean, we were talking about just Gondoliers as a whole. You know, the royal you.”
RHI: “I see. Well, sorry, I don’t really know much about the attack. I knew the two guys, but I wasn’t there. I haven’t been hit by any of these crew, but if you can get them to stop it’d be nice to, you know, have friends stop turning up with black eyes or broken legs, or dead.”
MADGE: “Yeah, well, I’ve got experience at this sort of thing.”
KIM: “And you said you didn’t really know anyone who you think would have any leads?”
RHI: “Afraid not.”
KIM: “How about this, oh. Ooh, idea, idea. Um, do you happen to know the exact place where they were hit? Maybe we could search there for clues.”
RHI: “I mean, if you want to, it’s been a few days and it’s rained, but you’re welcome to.” She points off down the canal. “It’s the East Queensway dock. You just, well, if you’ve got coin I can just take you there.”
MADGE: “Yeah, I’ve got coin.”
RHI: No, it’s not that expensive (laughs) to get a Gondolier ride, unless you wanna—
MADGE: Phin is committed to this.
RHI: Okay. I mean, if you wanna pay her extra you are welcome to do so.
MADGE: Yes. Also, Phin likes her.
KIM: Give her a tip. Give her a tip because she has big muscles.
MADGE: So… yeah.
(giggles)
RHI: Yeah. You hand her a sack of coin and her hand drops a little bit because it’s a lot heavier than she expected, and she sort of weighs it a little. “Alright…”
MADGE: I finger guns.
RHI: “Get you there as quickly as you can.” And she like holds out a hand to help you guys in, and goes pulling off down the canal. It’s not a long trip, like maybe ten minutes, and she gets you to the dock in question. As the tall, buff Gondolier lady is helping them step onto the dock, they notice painted on the wall, what looks like pitch, very, very dark black, kind of uneven spiral. Phin, you probably don’t know what it is. Blaire, knowing you and the kinds of things you get up to…
KIM: Yes.
RHI: You recognize this as the symbol of one of the forgotten gods. The god in question is the Father of the Abyss. The Gondolier who brought you here helps you guys out. “This is where the attack took place. We’ve been avoiding it for a bit, give the dead their space. If you wanna take a look around and see if there’s anything to find, you’re welcome to. I’m gonna…” and she like points back off down the canal.
KIM: “Yeah, no, totally fair.”
MADGE: “Oh, I think we’re good, yeah.”
KIM: “Thanks for the lift.”
RHI: “Good luck.”
KIM: “Bye~”
RHI: And she heads away down the canal. So yeah. What do you wanna look for? How do you wanna look?
KIM: I would like to Attune with my spirit mask and see if looking at the symbol through the mask can tell me anything more, and also just survey the area.
RHI: Yeah, then go ahead and roll Attune.
KIM: Oh, alright.
RHI: So, 2, so Limited Information. The symbol doesn’t really show up as anything special in your spirit mask. It’s not enchanted or anything, it’s just a symbol. So, the ghost field is many things, and it can show many things. One of those things is memories of a sort. The ghost field remembers older versions of Duskwall. That’s how you’re able to use a ghost key to open a door into the ghost field even if that door doesn’t exist in reality anymore. And when traumatic events happen, the ghost field will remember those, too.
So, you kind of turn and look away from the symbol towards the dock, and you can see two shadowy, blurred figures, moving defensively, throwing their arms up to protect their heads, curling in on themselves in pain, eventually falling to the dock. Basically you’re able to see a very vague echo of the attach, but you don’t see the attackers, you only see the victims.
KIM: “Oh. Yeah, something bad happened here.”
MADGE: “Yeah, they really suck at drawing targets.” I’ll do a Survey, or a Study.
RHI: You find some blood stains.
MADGE: “It looks like some people really got hurt here, huh?”
KIM: “II mean, we did get a little more information than just the attack. We have this symbol.”
MADGE: “Oh, it’s a symbol? Huh.”
KIM: “Oh, this? Yeah. Yeah, this is—“
MADGE: “I thought it was a target.”
KIM: “No. No, no, no. This is the symbol for the Father of the Abyss.”
MADGE: Can I just assume based on the name that it’s bad?
RHI: She can make whatever assumptions she would like.
MADGE: “So, Father of the Abyss… Cool…”
KIM: “It’s a cult.”
MADGE: “Yeah, no. I’m out.”
KIM: “No! No, no, no, this is our lead. We know which cult is going after these guys now.”
MADGE: “Okay, and they work for someone called the Father of the Abyss.”
KIM: “They more, like, worship the Father of the Abyss. It’s like a, it’s a cult. You know, how cult do.”
MADGE: “Okay, and, of the Abyss. You can see why I’m not keen on the whole worshipping a god of destruction and nothingness.”
KIM: “I would imagine it would upset most people, yes.”
RHI: So are you guys gonna keep poking around, or have you seen enough?
MADGE: I think I’ve seen enough. I’m gonna stare down the symbol a little bit longer, and do the little I’m watching you fingers.
KIM: “Why are you watching me? I’m not doing anything. I’m not joining a cult. I’m not a cult person. I, am, solitary, in my practices.”
MADGE: “Oh, sorry, no. No, it’s fine. I was pointing at that.”
KIM: “Oh! Oh, okay, yes. Got it.”
MADGE: “In case it has like some of your weird ghost thing.”
KIM: “No. this is literally just paint.”
MADGE: “Oh.”
KIM: “Yeah, we’re fine.”
MADGE: “Okay, cool.” And then I flip it off and I start walking away. (laughs)
RHI: Okay. So, the four of you reconvene, meet together at your lair to start planning?
JOSIE: Yeah, probably.
MINNA: Yeah.
RHI: Let’s say you guys gather back up a few hours later in the common room of The Nest. So, why don’t you describe your lair. Tell us about The Nest.
JOSIE: Well, first of all, it’s in that weird, abandoned tower.
KIM: Yeah, it’s an abandoned watch tower.
MADGE: Yeah, an old watch tower.
JOSIE: What’s the name of the district of town again?
RHI: Six Towers.
JOSIE: Six Towers. It like used to be a fancy noble district, but now it’s all dilapidated and run down.
RHI: Mm-hmm.
MINNA: And there’s all sorts of spooky stuff. If I remember correctly, Minx wanted to decorate the whole place nicely. Right?
JOSIE: Right. Her room is just choked with stolen finery and curtains and rugs and shit like that, and is just full to the brim with tacky niceties, and she’s always begging to let people decorate the rest of the common area. They’re probably like, “Yeah, no…”
RHI: What does the common area look like? What do you guys have in there? I know you have furniture that you stole from the Gray Cloaks at least.
KIM: yes, we have that really nice tapestry.
RHI: Right. You have a very pretty tapestry that you stole, from your first score.
MADGE: We probably have a big old table with a map on it.
MINNA: Probably a big bowl of those Magpie pins that we keep leaving everywhere.
MADGE: Yesss.
KIM: Yeah, we had to order those in bulk.
MINNA: Whose idea were those?
JOSIE: Mine.
RHI: Yeah, definitely. That 100% seems like a Minx thing.
JOSIE: Listen, aesthetic is important. Branding is important.
MINNA: Myra would agree that branding is important.
MADGE: I was just in it to punch things.
MINNA: And I just imagine that there has to be some kind of scarf pinned to the ceiling or something to give it that ambience for Minx.
JOSIE: Mm-hmm.
RHI: Minx learned that she can’t do everything all at once, so she’s been slowly sneaking more things into the common area, like one at a time.
JOSIE: Just little pieces of it.
RHI: It hasn’t reached critical mass where the others have noticed yet.
JOSIE: Yeah, just, there’s a slow trickle of kitsch slowly emerging from her overstuffed room to everywhere else.
RHI: So, you guys have some information. What are you guys thinking for a plan?
JOSIE: I feel like just standard second story entry will do us here.
MINNA: So we’re looking at stealth with a second story entry point.
RHI: So you’re gonna try and just go in through an upper window? Alright. Now we figure out the engagement rolls. We’re rolling 2d6 to see how things start. Okay, pretty good, could have been worse. You are in a risky position when the action starts.
We cut to the four of you on the roof, as usual. You’re at your chosen window. You’re about to try to start pulling it open when whoever is opening the window notices the alarm system that’s hooked up to the window.
JOSIE: Who’s best at disabling this sort of thing?
KIM: I have 1 in Tinker.
MINNA: I think everyone else probably has 0.
RHI, JOSIE, MADGE: Yeah.
RHI: The problem is the mechanism is inside.
MINNA: Well, can we see some other way in that looks relatively clear?
RHI: You would have to do something to try and find an alternate entry point.
MINNA: Would you like me to roll a Survey?
RHI: That would be great. This is going to be a Risky, Standard Effect.
MINNA: What would a Devil’s Bargain look like?
RHI: What would a Devil’s Bargain for here look like?
MINNA: Proposal.
RHI: Yeah, yeah, I’m open to ideas.
MINNA: It’s the kind of way in that we can only get like part of our crew through.
RHI: Ooh! Ooh, I like that! So, you’re looking around, and you realize there’s a smokestack that tinier members of your party, so Blaire and Myra might be able to fit in, but they would end up covered n soot. However, in order to see this, you have to like stand up and move around a little bit, and your walking around on the roof makes some noise. So, we’re gonna start a clock, Blue Coat Alert, and we are gonna call that… let’s see, that was Risky, yep. I’m gonna say you’re at 1 out of 6 on that. Actually, no, this is just gonna be a 4 clock, because it’s their home turf. They heard some noises, it’s not enough that they’re investigating yet, but you did see a way in.
MINNA: So, Myra knocks Blaire on the shoulder and she kinda nods to it.
KIM: “Huh?”
MINNA: “That smokestack. Do you think we could get through that?”
KIM: “Uh… Yeah, I think I could. What about you?”
MINNA: “I could probably do it.”
KIM: “Alright. Let’s go.”
MINNA: “We’ll let you two in.”
JOSIE: “Very well. I’d rather take the clean route.”
MADGE: “Yeah. I don’t really care about clean, but I mind about fitting.”
KIM: “My face is literally covered in dirt all the time. It’s fine.”
(laughter)
RHI: It’s a tight fit, which on one hand is good because it means you don’t just plummet down, but on the other hand it is kind of slow going, and you have to kind of shimmy down for a while. This is not letting out on the second floor. It might not even be letting out on the first floor. When you finally get to the bottom and sort of roll out, you are in a small room, stone walls and floor, lit by a single electric lamp by the door. You rolled out of the trash chute, essentially. This is the incinerator room.
KIM: “Ah, where I belong.”
MINNA: So this is the place where they burn all of their trash?
RHI: Mm-hmm.
KIM: Sick.
RHI: So, the two of you are in the basement, and the window that you were gonna let your friends in through is on the second floor.
KIM: (groans) “How… do we get up there?”
JOSIE: I imagine the stairs would be…
RHI: You’re not there. You’re sitting on the roof.
JOSIE: I know. I’m just saying.
(laughter)
MADGE: It’s like a cut from them figuring out what they’re gonna do to like these two chuckleheads sitting on top.
RHI: Sitting up would be too much, so I’m imagining you’re both just kinda like laying on your stomachs, chin rested on your folded arms, looking at each other, looking at the window, looking back at each other.
So yeah, Blaire and Myra, what are you two doing?
MINNA: Is there a way to peek out and see if there’s a clear way?
RHI: Sure. You can go to the door and crack it open, take a look outside.
MINNA: I’m gonna do that.
RHI: Okay. Open the door, glance out. There’s a hallway. It looks like there are stairs at the far end of the hallway. There’s also barred cells on either side of the hall, and you’re guessing based on some faint noise of movement and some shadows shifting in the light that at least some of them are occupied.
JOSIE: Meanwhile, outside, Minx is gonna improvise a little bit. So, okay, I’m just gonna pick like a particularly rowdy gang, and what I’m gonna do is take a cloth, cover it in soot, and then what I wanna do is—Is there like an alley on the side of the building?
RHI: Yeah.
JOSIE: Okay. What I wanna do is hop down there. Is anyone around on the street?
RHI: Nope. Not at this moment.
JOSIE: Sweet. So, what I’m gonna do is, hopefully without them immediately seeing, just sort of smear with the cloth across the front of the building that this gang or whatever, some really lewd insult to the Blue Coats, and ten like sign it with their logo or something.
RHI: In terms of gangs, you could go with the Lamp Blacks which is your rival gang, so you could make it so like the Lamp Blacks are telling the Blue Coats to go fuck themselves.
JOSIE: I’m gonna smear that there, and then I’m going to pull out a pistol.
RHI: Okay.
JOSIE: And then I’m gonna shoot one of the far windows.
RHI: Okay.
JOSIE: Probably on the ground level.
RHI: Yeah…
JOSIE: Just shoot it out, and then get back on the roof.
RHI: Okay. You’re gonna need to roll me something to get back up.
JOSIE: I feel like Finesse, or Prowl, or something.
RHI: This is probably Prowl.
JOSIE: Okay. What’s a Devil’s Bargain here look like?
RHI: Oh, this gets back to Bazso. He hears about this.
JOSIE: Oh…
RHI: Yeah. He’s gonna know that your gang used his gang to pull some shit with the Blue Coats. He’s gonna hear about it.
JOSIE: Oh god.
RHI: That’s the Devil’s Bargain I will give you.
JOSIE: And Nyryx isn’t gonna like me either if I do that. Agh… Fuck it, I’m gonna take the Devil’s Bargain.
RHI: Excellent!
JOSIE: Nice! 6!
RHI: 6, okay, yeah.
(sounds of awe)
RHI: So you smear this graffiti on the front door. I imagine you get like a running start towards wherever you’re gonna jump up to do your climb, and then just shoot and scramble up back onto the roof. Cutting back to the basement, you two are like standing—I’m picturing that you’re doing the like heads stacked on top of each other peering out the door.
(giggles)
You hear a muffled gunshot, then sounds of shouting and footsteps running upstairs.
KIM: “What was that?”
RHI: You also hear voices from the cells. “What the hell’s going on? Is somebody shooting at the station? I hope so.”
MINNA: “Whatever it is I think this gives us an opportunity. Let’s just hide our faces, hope these criminals don’t notice too much, get through here.”
JOSIE: Um, is the alarm going off?
RHI: Actually, yes. Yeah, there would be an alarm going off. So, it’s just like a bell, (ringing noises), ringing.
MINNA: “I just wanna make a run for those stairs, honestly.”
KIM: “Yeah, let’s make a run for it.”
RHI: So, you guys run for the stairs. Roof people, what are you doing?
JOSIE: Since the alarm’s going off, is anyone leaving the building?
RHI: Yeah, you get up there and you see about four Blue Coats, pistols drawn, pour out of the front of the building, shouting to each other. “Do you see anybody? Sweep the alleys! Check—“ You know, like they’re shouting orders to do a sweep.
JOSIE: And there’s an alarm going off already, right?
RHI: Yes.
JOSIE: Alright. So then I think I just pry open the window and we go in.
RHI: Yeah!
(laughter)
RHI: Okay, yep. You pop the window open, the alarm continues to go off, and you two can climb inside. You two are also standing in a hallway. There’s a door on either side of you, to your left and your right. You’re in a short little hallway, and it goes into a T-intersection, so the hallway branches off left and right.
MADGE: “Boulder, Paper, Sheers to see who goes which way?”
JOSIE: “Are you sure we wanna split us more?”
MADGE: “I mean, it’s kind of at the point where it can’t get any worse.”
JOSIE: “I suppose you’re right. Hopefully if we split up we’ll meet the other two faster.”
MADGE: “Yeah.”
JOSIE: “Do we even wanna look in these doors?” They don’t have anything marked on them, right?
RHI: No, they have little signs outside. If you guys are glancing at them quickly you’re gonna see each name plate has the name of two sergeants on it, so it looks like two sergeants share each office.
JOSIE: “Alright. These aren’t what we want. Look for like a head honcho’s office or something that might keep documents in.”
RHI: Myra had told you previously that this station doesn’t have an archives room. The files, reports would probably end up being kept in the chief’s office.
JOSIE: So probably an office with only one name on it.
RHI: Yes, and you guys actually know, because it would be, it’s good information for a bunch of criminals to have, the chief in Nightmarket is a guy named Edward Mason, and he is well known for his corruption and cruelty.
KIM: Oh, he’s gotta go down.
MADGE: Yeah.
RHI: I mean, the Blue Coats in general are known for their corruption and cruelty, but I mean he doesn’t really stand out. He’s pretty average in terms of Blue Coat levels of corruption. So yeah, but his name is not on either of these doors.
JOSIE: Alright, yeah. Let’s look for his door.
MADGE: Okay.
RHI: So, the two of you sweep the whole upper level.
JOSIE: Oh, should we like be rolling Survey to find his office or something?
RHI: Finding his office isn’t gonna be that hard, because there are nameplates. Finding specific things in any of the rooms will require some rolls. So like, if you guys want to search any of the rooms up here in any detail, like if you wanna check the little small barracks to see if anybody’s got anything valuable.
JOSIE: I think I’m going right for the documents, because time is of the essence here, because I just improvised this distraction.
MADGE: Yeah, same.
JOSIE: It’s not gonna take them long to figure out that no one was out there, so.
RHI: Okay. Blaire and Myra, you guys go running down the hall, and you hear the prisoners shouting after you. “Hey! Who are you? What? Hey, hey help! Let me out of here!” Do you guys respond at all?
MINNA: We just keep running, or at least Myra keeps running.
KIM: Blaire is going to stop for like just half a step. “Who—Who are you?”
RHI: “They call me Fidget. I don’t deserve to be in here. I didn’t kill that guy, or that other guy, or that girl. I just happened to be in the wrong place.”
KIM: “It sounds like you’re accused of being, well, a lot of people.”
RHI: “I—I didn’t kill them though! Come on, just—Just let me out!”
MINNA: I think Myra’s just like, “Psst psst, psst.”
KIM: “I’m sorry. We don’t have time.”
RHI: He just slams a fist against the bars as you go running off. You guys get up to the first floor. I’m gonna start another clock for when they come back in. they’re about half way through their outside sweep when you guys hit the first floor, and you’re not sure if everyone is outside or not. You guys are on the first floor. It’s like a small hallway, but then there’s an open door that looks like it leads out into a bigger room, and then the hallway continues past that with some other doors.
MINNA: I think I’m gonna be looking for the chief’s thing.
RHI: So, you guys kind of check the hallway really quick and then look into this bigger room that has a few desks and some benches and things, and you can see up at the front of the room is the front desk which is facing the front doors. There’s a woman in a Blue Coats uniform sitting there. She’s got a pistol in her hand, like sitting on the desk, and she’s kinda of like leaning over trying to look out the windows, as she has apparently been left behind to keep an eye on things inside, but she is sitting there holding a pistol. She’s got her back to you.
MINNA: We could do a group Prowl.
KIM: Yeah, that sounds better. I can lead. I haven’t taken any stress yet. Eyyy, 6.
RHI: Blaire, you are very stealthy as you sneak across, and you’re going to take a point of Stress. What I’m picturing is that like you crouch down really low and you’re like sneaking from desk to desk, signaling for Myra when it’s safe for her to go. You guys make your way across the room and you get to the desk sort of on the opposite side, and there’s a door in front of you with a nameplate next to it that says Chief Mason. Then we’re gonna cut to the other two that are about to come down the stairs.
Minx and Phin, you guys are coming down the stairs. Are you trying to be particularly sneaky?
MADGE: Nah. I mean, I’m not. I don’t know how Minx is doing.
JOSIE: We’re placing speed over subtlety here, I think.
MADGE: Yeah, which is pretty much always Phin’s modus operandi, so.
JOSIE: (laughs)
RHI: So, you guys come clattering down the steps, and if you guys glance out into that big room you see Myra and Blaire crouched down together behind a desk, woman at the front desk who is now kind of looking around back over her shoulder towards the stairs with the pistol in her hand, seems like she heard you guys a little bit.
MADGE: “Okay. Okay. Okay. I have an idea.”
JOSIE: “Uh-huh?”
MADGE: “You pretend like you’re dying, and we’ll go up to her and distract her while Myra and Blaire are in getting the things.”
JOSIE: “Okay, but she’s gonna be immediately suspicious of how we got in here.”
MADGE: “It’s a police station. We can say we saw that it was a police station, we needed help.”
JOSIE: “Alright. Alright. I’ll do it. I’ll do it.”
MADGE: “Okay. Lean against me. Act like you’re dying.”
JOSIE: Minx puts on the full waterworks and just goes full drama about it, and just very loudly is, oh, woe is me!
MADGE: “My friend is dying!”
RHI: Okay, so are you two making—This sounds like a group check. What–?
JOSIE: Probably Sway, yeah?
RHI: Probably Sway. So who would like to lead this?
JOSIE: Who has less Stress?
MADGE: (giggles) I think you do. How much Stress do you have?
JOSIE: Really? I have 5.
MADGE: I have 7.
JOSIE: Alright, I’ll lead.
(laughter)
KIM: Y’all…
JOSIE: It’s only risking 2.
RHI: Yeah, so both of you go ahead and roll your Sway.
MADGE: (laughs, claps)
MINNA: For the listeners at home, Madge has rolled a 2, and then Minx rolled a 6 and a 1.
RHI: So, fortunately, that 6 is the one that’s gonna apply. Good god. You come running out, Minx just sobbing, like stumbling, falling on desks, knocking things over. The woman initially whips around with her pistol up and then sees you like clinging to a desk crying, and like looks baffled and lowers… “Who—Who are you? How did you get in here?!”
MADGE: “We needed help! They tell us to go to the Blue Coats when we need help, and my friend is dying!” I elbow her.
JOSIE: (laughs) “Oh! It hurts! It hurts so much!”
RHI: “Oh, okay.” She holsters her pistol. “What happened? What’s wrong?” And like, comes over and is like helping you up.
MADGE: Can I knock her out?
RHI: Yeah, yeah. You can make some kind of roll to just try and like punch her out. So, this is gonna be Risky, Standard Effect.
MADGE: What’s a Devil’s Bargain to give me another d6? I mean, aside from the fact that I’m punching a cop.
RHI: Yeah, you’re punching a cop in the police station.
KIM: Damn.
RHI: She’s gonna remember your face.
MADGE: (gasps) Oh my gosh…
RHI: So a 4… You do it, you punch her, but there’s a consequence.
MADGE: One of my arms still has shrapnel in it. Could it be with that one?
RHI: Oh, yeah. Yeah, so it’s Lessened Effect. I was going to advance the clock on the Blue Coats returning and she’s not knocked out.
MADGE: Okay.
RHI: You sock her in the jaw and she kind of staggers, but she’s not out of it.
JOSIE: Trance powder to the face!
(laughter)
MADGE: Pocket sand!
RHI: Go ahead. You’re gonna have to make some kind of roll for it. What do you wanna try and do?
JOSIE: I’ll go with Skirmish, and what’s the Devil’s Bargain here?
RHI: Man, you guys are just hankering for these tonight.
JOSIE: Well, we’re in one of those rare situations where Stress is a more precious commodity.
RHI: She’s gonna remember you, too.
JOSIE: I’ll take that Devil’s Bargain. 5.
RHI: Okay, I’ll give you a choice. Either I fill in the last tick on that clock with the Blue Coats returning and they’re gonna come back, or you hit her with the powder but before it takes effect she is able to take a swing at you and just clobbers you upside the head.
JOSIE: I’ll take that second one.
RHI: So, you blow the powder, and she just takes a wild swing at you, and just punches you across the jaw. You’re going to take Level 2 Harm, Bloody Mouth.
JOSIE: Ouch.
RHI: You do have the option to Resist.
JOSIE: I do have 3 dice in my prowess Resist, so I think I’m gonna go for it. 5.
RHI: You take one Stress.
JOSIE: Woo!
RHI: And, that’s gonna drop it to Level 1 Harm, Bruised Jaw. It’s gonna make it a little harder for you to talk. You’re gonna be at Lesser Effect on social stuff until you get that taken care of.
JOSIE: Aw, but that’s like my thing.
RHI: Yeah, I know. I know what I did. So while that scuffle is happening, Blaire and Myra, what are you guys doing?
MINNA: I think we’re gonna go into that office, right?
KIM: Right.
RHI: So, you run over to the office, grab the door, try the door, door is locked.
KIM: Would it be a Tinker to pick it?
RHI: Yeah, but it’s gonna be Risky with Zero Effect, because you’re so mismatched in terms of tier. You essentially have Tier 0 tools that you’re trying to use on a Tier 3 lock, so in order to make any progress on it you’re gonna have to push yourself.
KIM: Yeah. That’s fine, I have the Stress to spare.
RHI: Yeah, take 2 Stress, and then go ahead and make your roll. Okay, so you do it, there’s a consequence… I think I gotta finish that clock.
JOSIE: God damn it.
KIM: (sigh)
RHI: And because you’re at lesser effect you don’t have it open yet.
KIM: Yeah.
RHI: So, the scene is, Blaire and Myra are crouched by the chief’s door, Phin and Minx are over by the desk with a blissed out Blue Coat officer who’s like staring vacantly into space, and you guys hear boots on the front steps. You all have about three seconds.
JOSIE: I think we get the fuck out of the entry way. Right? I wanna go find the other two.
MADGE: Yep! I’m ducking behind a desk.
RHI: Yeah. The way that I’m imagining this, there’s not a clear line of sight from the front door to the chief’s door, but also with a little bit of walking they’d be able to see you guys very easily, so you’re only a little bit hidden. So, they come back in, there’s four of them, grumbling to themselves about the hazing rituals. They see the woman just kinda standing, swaying a little bit in place, staring lankly off.
JOSIE: Oh, right. I forgot to do something with her.
RHI: Mm-hmm. A couple of them are just like, (sigh) “Luce? Lucille? What the—What are you doing? Come on, get back to—Lucy?” A couple of them are still sort of up at the front going to deal with the broken window, but two of them come over. They haven’t seen any of you yet, but at this point it’s kind of like if either of them glances over towards the chief’s office they will see all three of you who are huddled there. Right now they’re focused on her trying to figure out what’s wrong. What are you guys gonna do?
JOSIE: How close are you on that door?
RHI: Do you wanna make another roll to try and get the door open?
KIM: Yes. Would I have to push myself again?
RHI: You’d have to push yourself to get effect. If you would like to get 2d6, somebody can take a point of Stress to assist you.
MINNA: Uh, I’m happy to do that.
KIM: Thank you.
RHI: So, Myra takes 1 point of stress, Blaire you take 2, and then you roll 2d6.
KIM: Ugh. Jeez…
RHI: Oh god.
JOSIE: Oh boy.
RHI: Okay. Hoo-boy. Things go badly.
KIM: Yeah…
RHI: God, actually, I forgot to set position again. I gotta get better about that. Well, I’m gonna give you a point of experience, because this was desperate, but they see you guys, and Blaire one of them takes a shot at you.
SEVERAL: (gasps) Nooo!
RHI: And you’re gonna take Severe Harm. It’s gonna be Level 3 Harm, Shot in the Back.
KIM: No, my baby!
RHI: But, you can roll to Resist. If you don’t Resist, like, somebody is going to have to carry you out of here.
KIM: Oh no. I only have like 4 Stress left to spare.
RHI: Well, if you get basically a 4 or higher. You got a 50/50 shot.
KIM: I don’t know if I like those odds.
RHI: Yeah, well, you can get shot in the back.
KIM: I guess for dramatic purposes, yeah.
RHI: So Blaire gets shot.
KIM: (whines)
JOSIE: No, baby.
MADGE: Cool cool cool cool cool. Um, I’m downing that Rage Essence vile.
RHI: Okay. Rage Essence: Greatly enhances the user’s strength, resistance to pain, and irrational aggression for the span of several minutes. You suffer 2 Consequences, can’t tell friend from foe, and can’t stop until they’re all broken. So, you just stop wailing on them.
MADGE: I’m gonna wreck it!
(laughter)
RHI: Probably with a chair.
MADGE: yes!
RHI: And basically, sort of for narrative, I’m gonna say you get a free round of just beating the crap out of them because they are not expecting this. So, the rest of you can try to figure out how to get into this door. I will remind you, particularly Blaire, you have a ghost key.
KIM: I do.
MINNA: Blaire has also just been shot.
MADGE: Yeah.
RHI: Blaire can act if she pushes herself or if somebody takes Stress to help her.
MINNA: I mean, I’ll take Stress to help her.
KIM: Thank you.
MINNA: I only have 1 Stress right now.
RHI: Okay, so you take a point of Stress to help Blaire up as Blaire I imagine is pulling out whatever the key looks like. What does the key look like?
KIM: Ooh. Alright, yeah. It is glowing green, and fuck it, yeah, it just has a skull at the end of it.
RHI: Excellent. You can look into the ghost field, and it’s actually a little easier for you now because you are so close to death.
KIM: Oh. Great.
RHI: You can look into the ghost field much easier. Myra is kind of supporting you, helping you up. I think it’s gonna need to be an Attune roll to get the door open.
KIM: That is fair.
MINNA: Is that something that Blaire has to do, or could someone else work the ghost key?
RHI: You’re helping Blaire do it by taking that Stress, but Blaire’s gotta make the roll.
KIM: Oh boy. Alright. I got a 2 and a 6.
RHI: 6 is what you needed. So you are able to use your ghost key. Myra gets you up on your feet. You’re holding the mask up to your face with one hand, you’ve got the key in your other hand, you look into the ghost field, and it’s a little brighter and clearer than it normally is, which is worrying, but you’re able to reach out and open up the door, and it swings open, and the three of you can get inside.
JOSIE: Alright. I’m gonna ransack the place.
MINNA: I’m gonna look specifically for that report.
RHI: Okay. What are you guys rolling?
MINNA: Survey, and I’m gonna push myself to get an extra die.
JOSIE: Yeah, it’s all the same for me, so I’m gonna roll Survey as well.
RHI: Did you guys wanna do that as a group action?
MINNA: Oh please. I’ll lead it.
JOSIE: Josie, you rolled a 5? Okay. Myra takes a point of stress. The two of you tear the office apart. So, you find it, but there’s a consequence. The Blue Coats who aren’t involved in the fight just yet are going to start calling for backup. So I’m gonna start a new clock, Backup Arrives. Now fortunately, because you guys picked an hour when not as many people are close by…
JOSIE: Ah-ha!
MADGE: It’s gonna take a while… Yay!
RHI: You’re at 1 out of 6. It’s gonna be a little bit before anybody can get here.
KIM: Good.
RHI: You find the file. Fortunately for you also, the chief’s office has windows.
MADGE: Yes!
JOSIE: Oh, okay, rad.
MINNA: Yeah, let’s just leave through the windows.
MADGE: You guys should leave me, probably.
JOSIE: I mean, I feel like that’s a bad idea, but I also don’t know how to get you out without you attacking us.
MINNA: Do we know about the Rage vile?
RHI: I would imagine you guys saw her down it. She jumped over a desk and started beating people with a chair.
MINNA: Yeah, I’m just wondering if Myra’s seen that in action or something.
RHI: That’s kind of up to Phin. Has she used this in front of you guys before?
MINNA: Especially because Myra and Phin have been working together a while.
MADGE: Yeah, I think Myra knows. Myra would definitely know that Phin has it on her person all the time.
JOSIE: I wanna make a run for her. I have an unusual weapon left, so I could like drop a smoke bomb or something.
MINNA: If Minx tries to go for it, Myra’s gonna like kinda grab her arm. “No, don’t. there’s nothing you can do.”
JOSIE: “But—What? We can’t leave someone behind, can we? Or is she like the fall girl now?”
MINNA: “Listen, she’s going to keep attacking people, including us, until everyone here is dead, so either she gets out of here or everyone here dies.”
JOSIE: “Alright, well, I guess we better get through this window then. I guess we just hope she shows up later.”
MINNA: “It’s really all we can do. It’s not good.”
JOSIE: “It’s most unseemly to leave a comrade behind, however.”
MINNA: “I’m not happy about it either.”
MADGE: Cut to Phin who is like laughing maniacally. I have like scary weapons, so she has her scary weapon out. Can they be like really freaky looking brass knuckles?
RHI: Yeah, maybe they’re like spiked.
MADGE: Yes! They’re spiked!
JOSIE: “Although I suppose she’s not being very seemly herself. Let’s go.”
MINNA: Myra’s got competing drives right now, help the person you’re loyal to versus preserve your own life. Okay, fuck it, she’s gonna pull out her Slumber Essence vial and run out of the room.
RHI: Okay. Minx, what are you doing?
JOSIE: Yeah, I’ll get Blaire out.
RHI: You pick up Blaire, who is tiny, and climb out the window, and book it. The front desk officer who is on Trance Powder is on the floor. There’s a lot of blood. The other two officers are putting up a fight. Phin, you’re gonna take Level 1 Harm, Battered. They’re getting some hits in, but you’re more resistant to it than usual. Myra, you’re gonna have to get in there and somehow get this into her face.
MINNA: I think what she does is she immediately kind of runs up behind her and goes, “Hey, come with me!”
MADGE: Yeah, and then Phin’s gonna turn around to face her.
RHI: Myra, it’s gonna be your roll.
MINNA: I think what it looks like is she’s going to be trying to basically stuff a handkerchief into her mouth that is soaked in this stuff. What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
RHI: You’re gonna take Level 1 Harm, Exhaustion, because this has just been such an awful friggin’ night, that you’re just gonna be really drained after this.
MINNA: I’ll take that Devil’s Bargain.
MADGE: I have made some mistakes this session.
MINNA: Good, I can only roll 2’s.
MADGE: Okay.
RHI: So, I think what happens is you try to get it in her face, she dodges, and you guys are just kind of weaving around each other. Basically, it’s just taking time, so backup is getting closer.
MADGE: So, with resisting, I have a question. Is that a thing I can choose to do at any time? If at this point some inner part of my mind was like, yo, maybe we should not hurt our friend, could I roll for that now?
RHI: If you want to, but be aware that—like, how many points of Stress do you have?
MADGE: (laughs)
RHI: You have like 7, right?
MADGE: Yeah, I only have 2 left.
RHI: Okay. So, if you roll anything other than a 5 or a 6 you’re gonna take Trauma.
MADGE: (exasperated laughter) Oh gosh… But if I take Trauma I have to leave.
RHI: Yes. You can risk that.
MADGE: I GOT A 6!
RHI: Okay.
MADGE: Thank god… (gasps)
RHI: You take no Stress, and you suddenly snap out of it, and realize this is a friend.
MADGE: Oh thank goodness!
MINNA: Myra sees this fist about to come at her, and then stop, and she’s like, “Is it you now?”
MADGE: “Yeah.” (sighs) “That was pretty close.”
MINNA: “Alright, let’s get out of here, because it’s already pretty close in other ways. There’s an open window in that office. I’d rather go out the side.”
MADGE: “Good plan, yeah. Did I actually hit you, at any point?”
MINNA: “No, you didn’t manage it.”
RHI: Yeah, so you two run for the office, get out. Phin is still feeling the Rage vile, and Myra you basically have to steer her so that you’re not actually seeing any other people.
MADGE: I need blinders?
RHI: Yeah, and she’s just randomly punching walls and shit as you guys are running.
MINNA: I’m holding onto her arm for dear life, and kind of in an undertone the whole time. “Calm, calm, it’s okay, you don’t have to attack anyone. We’re going to go home, and it’s going to be okay.”
MADGE: (through gritted teeth) “I am perfectly calm.”
RHI: You make it back to the lair. Where do you guys take Blaire to get patched up?
MADGE: I imagine Sawtooth would have a practice.
RHI: So, you show up at—
MADGE: The back door of his practice.
RHI: And we’re gonna shift into downtime. So, you guys are gonna get 4 Rep, because that’s all you can get, and now you’re maxed out. We will do Coin next session when you guys actually deliver the report to Lani and Roxanne. Heat…
(laughter)
MINNA: We attacked a police station!
RHI: I’m gonna say, this is, you’re getting a wanted level.
MADGE: Yeah.
JOSIE: Oh dear.
MINNA: Oh good.
RHI: Wanted Level 1. Okay, so now we’re gonna transition into downtime. We’re gonna start with Blaire who is going to be doing Recovery. You can do Recovery as both of your downtime actions, which I would strongly recommend.
KIM: Yes.
RHI: Your first one, you fill 3 ticks on your progress clock. Do you wanna heal again?
KIM: Yes.
RHI: Okay. The second one, you fill 1. That will fill your Level 3 Harm, so it no drops down to Level 2. So, those are your two downtime actions unless you want to later spend Rep to do more. We’ll circle back to that.
KIM: Okay.
RHI: We’re gonna pause now in the rest of the downtime actions. I’m picturing this as while Blaire is being sewn up, you guys start looking over the file.
MINNA: I feel like me and Minx kind of cluster together, like looking over each other’s shoulders basically.
RHI: The file says that a group of patrolmen responded to a request for help at the East Queensway canal dock where two Gondoliers had been severely beaten. They were taken to the station for medical treatment and interrogation. They reported that a group of six individuals came up and started asking them some questions about the sort of things they find on the canals, if they talk to spirits. The two Gondoliers didn’t really wanna talk about it, and when they stopped talking the six people who had shown up started attacking them.
The leader, a woman who was addressed as Thorn, asked what they knew about someone or something called Kotar, someone named Tya Laren, a comment in the document notes that she’s a cultist, and something called a Blood Iron Ring. Both of the Gondoliers were able to identify either via description or by name a few of the attackers, and the report notes that the attackers had past affiliation with a gang called the Umbra Hunters.
The Umbra Hunters, both Myra and Minx, you recognize the name. they were a gang that was active in Nightmarket and Six Towers a while ago, but they got broken up by the Blue Coats about six or seven years ago. There was a raid on their headquarters, all of the leadership got arrested, so the fact that they’re marked as paid up is weird, because they haven’t been doing anything for a long time.
MADGE: With Phin, she’s gonna look over it enough to see the paid up, no charges filed, and then she’s just gonna leave.
JOSIE: That is weird, unless they’ve been around under a different name. I mean, we might wanna be on the lookout for them. You said they used to be active in Nightmarket and Six Towers, right?
RHI: Yeah. Yeah, in your neighborhoods. For now, you guys look over the file, and then you’re gonna be kind of taking care of yourselves before you deliver it.
KIM: That sounds best.
RHI: I imagine that people are going to want to indulge their vice.
JOSIE: Uh, yeah.
MADGE: Heck yes. (laughs)
RHI: You’re gonna heal up.
JOSIE: While she’s healing, Minx is just super pouty and doing everything she can to cover up bruises and stuff like that, wearing heavier makeup than normal.
RHI: You fill 3 out of your 4 on your healing clock.
JOSIE: Can I spend another Rep?
RHI: Yeah. So, that was your two actions, indulging your vice and getting healed up, and then if you wanna do a third…
JOSIE: I think I’m gonna spend my Rep to instead just make sure I’m healed, because Minx is like, no, my beautiful face.
RHI: Okay, so you are fully healed. Minx basically sits around in the doctor’s office, and gets healed up, and then goes on a shopping spree.
JOSIE: Mm-hmm.
RHI: Indulges in all sorts of wonderful luxuries, and feels better about things.
JOSIE: (laughs)
RHI: Phin, you have stormed off.
MADGE: Yeah. I feel like after that she just stormed from The Nest to the fight pits, and like doesn’t leave for a day and a half.
RHI: Okay. So, yeah, you indulge your vice. Are you doing that once or twice?
MADGE: I’m doing it twice.
RHI: You got a total of 8, so you cleared all your Stress. Somewhat unsurprisingly, yes, you have overindulged, and so during all those fights you rant about Blue Coat corruption, and how you guys stuck it to the bastards with that raid on Nightmarket station, which ends up bringing 2 more Heat on the crew.
MADGE: Yeah, I should probably spend a Rep and heal up.
RHI: You eventually stagger your way back to your Physicker buddy.
MADGE: yeah, she like gets there, she’s all bruised up and she smiles a bit. She’s like, “Hey buddy…”
RHI: He’s seen this from you a lot, so he just waves you in and starts getting bandages and rubbing alcohol. You’re gonna fill in two of the marks on your healing clock. Myra?
MINNA: I would like to heal, first and foremost. My things are healing Gunshot Leg and Exhaustion. I might just go to my usual guy, because I semi-trust him. I’m still exhausted.
RHI: So then you indulge your vice… 5.
MINNA: God, if I rolled a 6 I would have overindulged as well.
RHI: Okay, so yeah, you clear 5 Stress. Do you want to spend Rep to do anything else?
MINNA: There are some things I can think of to do, I don’t need to do them, but I’ll start a long term project on researching the stuff we just dug up.
RHI: Yeah, if you wanna start doing some research.
MINNA: I’m personally very curious about the Blood Iron Ring.
RHI: Yeah, you can absolutely do that. Mark on your sheet Long Term Project. What did you get?
MINNA: A 4.
RHI: So you’re now at 2 out of 8. Blaire, you wanted to spend a point of Rep to do something else to indulge your vice?
KIM: Yeah.
RHI: Yeah, so just roll 1d6.
KIM: Cool. I got a 2.
RHI: Well, you clear 2 Stress. You feel a little better off. So, you guys basically do this job and then have to hunker down for a while, because it was a bad time, but you have a lot of fairly interesting information now and you do have this connection to these journalists who said they might be able to help you get some more information in the future. I think we’re gonna wrap it up here with you guys gathered back in the lair, licking your collective wounds, and preparing to go out to collect your pay, and hopefully get a little more information about all of these weird things you’ve just uncovered.

RHI: Welcome back to Duskwall. First, let me say I’m completely blown away by the response we’ve gotten to our first episode. Thank you so much for joining in to listen to this band of misfit criminals tumble head first into disaster every other week.
I want to give a special shout out to Tess of RPG Podcasts. She has promoted our show and given me all sorts of advice on how to actually do this whole running a podcast thing, and I’m incredibly grateful to her. There’s a link to her site in the show notes. Please check it out, and follow her on Twitter as well.
A couple things about today’s episode:
Due to a work schedule conflict and then a power outage, Madge was unable to join us for this recording session. Phin will be back in Episode 4. Why not in Episode 3, you ask? Because this is Part 1 of our very first two-parter.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity. Starting this month we’ll be highlighting different charities that support causes important to our cast. Our first featured charity is your local NAACP chapter.
Last December, the democratic candidate for senator won a highly contested special election in Alabama, a victory that has pulled some small amount of power out of the GOP’s hands. This victory was due almost entirely to voters of color who were able to overcome systemic voter suppression thanks to the tireless efforts of the Alabama NAACP. Voters of color face continued challenges to their right to vote throughout the country, and local NAACP chapters are among the leaders in championing those rights. If you’re able, donate a few dollars to your local chapter or see if they need volunteers. A link to the national NAACP website will be in the show notes.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
##
RHI: So, it has been about a week since your… what’s a good word for it… challenging assault on the Nightmarket Blue Coats station.
JOSIE: That’s a nice blameless word for it.
(laughter)
RHI: So, you guys have spent the last week healing up a lot, indulging your vices, basically laying low. While you have been hiding out in your lair, you guys have been making some upgrades.
MINNA: What I think would happen is they all turn to each other, and they’re like, well we’ve been making a lot of waves, and there’s a lot of heat coming at us, maybe it’s time we sort of make sure we’re safe at home. So, we got alarms. How does it look? Do we booby trap it or something?
JOSIE: So, it’s like, triggered lights, and ringing bells, and alarms and stuff.
MINNA: How do we let it know it’s us?
JOSIE: We could each have a special key or something.
MINNA: Oh yeah, I like that a lot.
KIM: Yeah.
JOSIE: Like, if we put that key into one of the doors, that lets us in, it turns off the alarm before it opens.
MINNA: When we weren’t recovering we spent time installing that together, which I’m sure was a big group effort.
JOSIE: Minx spends a lot of time disguising it so it just looks like decoration, or isn’t visible at all, because it’s clunky and ugly. We also got a vault.
RHI: Yes, and how did you guys go about that?
JOSIE: I have an idea on that. Most of The Nest is on the top floor of this tower, right? I like the idea of the floor below becoming our vault, and it kind of gets sealed off, and then there’s a door in the floor of our main space.
MINNA: Oh yeah.
RHI: Oh, cool. So you guys have a trap door in your main lair living space, and then you climb down that into the sealed off floor below. So, you guys have spent your week doing all that, and now you’re finally getting around to delivering that report that you stole to Lani and Roxanne over at the North Hook Mirror. We open with three of the four of you over in the docks in Ink Lane, and it’s only the three of you today because Phin is out on the boat with the rest of her family. Her two older brothers got sick, and her parents guilted her into coming out to take their place, so she will be out on the Void Sea for the foreseeable future. So, she is off dealing with that instead of working with you guys today.
So, you guys reach the offices of the North Hook Mirror, and inside it’s a scene of organized chaos. There’s a lot of desks, a lot of people hurrying around, there’s the smell of ink and…
MINNA: Warm paper.
RHI: Yeah, yeah, that fresh news print smell in the air. Eventually, as you guys are standing there, some young looking late teens page comes up. “Oh, um, hi. Can I help you with something?”
JOSIE: “Yes. We have a previous appointment with Ms. Athari and Ms. Elpis. We do believe we have a tasty scoop for them, as it were.”
RHI: “Oh, okay! Uh, hang on just a second.” She goes running off, comes back a minute later with Roxanne in toe, and when she sees you Roxanne says, “Oh,” (sighs in relief) “Good. I’m, I’m glad you’re alright. We heard about—“ She glances down at the page. “Why don’t you come back to the office?”
She leads the three of you back, weaving through the desks and things, and takes you back to a fairly small, crowded office. There’s two desks wedged in there, a few book cases, there is just paper everywhere. There are reams of paper on the bookshelves, on the desks, there’s paper tacked up all over the walls. It is an incredible fire hazard. When you come in, Lani is sitting at one of the desks taking some notes, and she also looks relieved and signs, “It’s good to see you,” and Roxanne translates that.
Roxanne basically picks up where she left off when she came and collected you. “We heard about the assault on the Nightmarket station, and we figured that was you, but then you didn’t turn up. We were a bit worried. So, it’s very good to see you all in one place. Although… Oh no.” She suddenly seems to realize there’s only three of you. “Is—Is the other one…?”
KIM: “Oh, Phin’s fine. Yeah.”
RHI: (sighs in relief) “Oh, good.”
KIM: “Yeah, don’t worry about it.”
JOSIE: “We’re all fine aside from some bumps and bruises. We’ve had worse.”
KIM: “Yeah, nothing we can’t handle.”
RHI: “Okay. That’s good to hear.” Lani starts signing, and Roxanne translates again. “Were you able to find the report?”
JOSIE: “Indeed. Right here.”
RHI: “Wonderful. Thank you.” Lani takes it and skims through it, and she kind of scowls as she’s reading it, and signs something that Roxanne does not translate. Minx, I think in addition to being able to flirt in every language you also know how to curse in a lot of languages.
JOSIE: Ah, yeah, that makes sense. (laughs)
RHI: As she’s reading she just signs, “Fucking asshole,” you’re guessing probably in response to the commentary left by the Blue Coat chief. She reads through it and shakes her head a little bit, and starts signing. “Thank you so much for this. There are a lot of leads in here. A lot of it we’re not really sure what to do with yet, but it’s a start. It’s a lot more than we had previously.” Lani leans over to the desk and rummages around in a drawer, and pulls out a couple small bags of Coin and holds it out to you.
JOSIE: “Ah, excellent. I do love a clean exchange.”
RHI: Lani signs, “I know we told you that we would give you information in addition to the money. There’s a lot in this report that we could look into. Is there anything in particular you are interested in that you’d like us to focus on getting to you first?”
JOSIE: What exactly was in the report again?
MINNA: The list of leads that we received from the report: There were attacks and murders of some gondoliers, there’s a cult following the Father of the Abyss, we have the name Kotar, Myra’s currently researching the Blood Iron Ring which we also heard about, there was a Tayalarin, a cultist in hiding, and the Umbra Hunters gang is involved in all this. Where were they active again?
RHI: They were active in your neighborhoods, Nightmarket and Six Towers.
MINNA: So, I feel like it would be good to have them research the Umbra Hunters for us. I think we’ll point out that bit in the report.
RHI: Lani looks over it again a little more closely, and Roxanne kind of leans over her shoulder.
MINNA: “I know Blue Coat corruption isn’t news, but the Umbra Hunters haven’t been active for some time, as far as we know.”
RHI: Roxanne translates that and Lani nods, looking very confused, and she replies, “Yeah, that’s very strange. I remember when that gang was broken up. As far as I knew they had completely fallen apart, so this is strange. Yeah, we can look into that, and as soon as we have any concrete information for you we’ll share it.”
JOSIE: “Excellent. Then I do believe all debts are being resolved. Yes?”
RHI: “I believe so.”
JOSIE: “Though, of course you’re always welcome to call upon us again.”
RHI: “I was just going to say, I hope that we can contact you again if we need any more information obtained.”
MINNA: “As long as you keep in mind that we don’t work for free.”
RHI: “Of course.” Alright, you guys gonna head on out then?
JOSIE: Mm-hmm. Minx will sign goodbyes.
RHI: Lani smiles and signs back. “Have a nice day.”
The three of you head outside to the street. At this point you have wrapped up your obligations from the previous score, and you are free to do whatever you would like.
JOSIE: “Now, we have been working on this project a bit, but I do believe our dwelling does need a bit more color in it. Yes?”
KIM: “What do you mean?”
JOSIE: “You know, decorations.”
MINNA: “This again, Minx?”
JOSIE: “I’m thinking paintings.”
KIM: “What kind of paintings?”
JOSIE: “The sort that people would pay for.”
MINNA: “The sort that we should get people to pay us for.”
JOSIE: “Exactly.”
KIM: “So, that really abstract shit that everybody pretends to understand but nobody really does?”
JOSIE: “Well, I mean, some people are incapable of understanding it, but if you want I could try to explain what high society’s opinion of these things are,” (laughing) “But anyway, that is beside the point.”
KIM: “I…”
(laughter)
MINNA: Do we know what Minx’s background is?
RHI: Wowww. Minx totally doesn’t understand it either.
JOSIE: No, no. She only thinks she is high society, so any explanation she would give you is total bull crap.
KIM: “Can we agree that contemporary art is kind of bullshit, though?”
MINNA: “I don’t care what the paintings mean. Can we get some of them to sell as well?”
JOSIE: “Yes, of course. I do believe that people would shell out quite a fortune for some of these very unique works, even overlooking certain facts about the piece that make it less unique. I’m saying we should forge paintings, that’s what we should do.”
KIM: “Oh, cool. Okay.”
MINNA: “Did you have some in mind?”
JOSIE: “Hmm… Well, I do believe this might require a trip to a gallery.”
KIM: (groans heavily)
MINNA: (shrieks in laughter)
RHI: (laughs)
JOSIE: “Oh, come now, it’ll do you good to have some culture in you.”
KIM: “Wha—I’m cultured! I read!”
RHI: So, you’re thinking you need to go find a gallery.
JOSIE: Is there such a thing as a museum, or is it all private collections?
RHI: I don’t think there are public museums, because this is not a society that is very concerned with educating the masses. It is exclusively the domain of the wealthy. It’s basically Gather Information. You’re gonna need to figure out who has a collection that you could gain access to. How do you wanna go about doing that?
JOSIE: How high class is the institution Nyryx works at?
RHI: Yeah, Nyryx works at the Red Lamp in Silk Shore, which I think that is a high class place. It’s one of the oldest if not the oldest brothels in the city. You could definitely go and chat with her and see if she has heard anything interesting.
JOSIE: Yeah. I think I wanna do that. I don’t know if she’ll be insulted that I’m asking her to violate like client privacy or whatever.
RHI: You and Nyryx are kind of an on again off again thing, that the rest of the crew will occasionally hear about it when either you are newly on or newly off.
JOSIE: Yeah. Correct.
(laughter)
MINNA: I’m just imagining Minx draped over a sofa, being dramatic about it.
JOSIE: Oh yeah. Break ups with Minx are the absolute worst for everyone in The Nest.
KIM: Yep.
RHI: (laughs) They just come in, and she’s just on a fainting couch, a hand on her forehead, a glass of wine in the other hand, just posing dramatically.
So, that does raise the question as the three of you are making your way over to Silk Shore. Are you and Nyryx on or off at this point?
JOSIE: I think we are in a hard off position right now. Oh, I want to bring some wine. Peace offering.
KIM: Is it good wine?
JOSIE: Yes.
KIM: Okay.
JOSIE: Well, actually, it’s probably not the super finest. It’s one Minx knows she likes, rather than going off monetary value alone here.
RHI: So, you guys make your way across one of the bridges into Silk Shore, which is the pleasure district of Duskwall. Most of the city’s brothels are here, drug dens, casinos, basically any vice you could hope to indulge can be found here. You guys are heading for the Red Lamp Brothel. Describe for me what the lobby entry way looks like.
JOSIE: I feel like it’s definitely made for comfort and getting you in the mood, a little bit, but it has a very clean air about it.
RHI: So, based on what you’re saying, it looks more like the front lobby of a hotel.
JOSIE: Yes, exactly.
RHI: So it’s got some nice plush chairs, there’s probably a fireplace.
KIM: Maybe a chandelier.
RHI: Mm-hmm. Definitely a big fancy chandelier. Some nice plush rugs on the floor, some tasteful artwork. There’s a young man standing behind the counter, and he looks up and for a second is kind of confused, because he doesn’t recognize Blaire or Myra, but then he sees Minx and smirks, and sees the bottle of wine. “Mmm. Are you in the dog house again, love?”
JOSIE: “Not, not, not quite, dear. Just a chat.”
RHI: “Ah, that didn’t sound too confident to me. Let me see if she’s free.” He flips through a book and runs his finger down it. “Um, yeah, she’s not starting for another couple hours. Let me ring her down for you. God luck.” He winks at you and walks off. A few minutes later she comes down the stairs. What does Nyryx look like?
JOSIE: I think Nyryx is kind of, longer hair, really dark black hair. She might be not Akoros in heritage. She’s the sort of person who kind of keeps things simple in her dress, but she just kind of rocks anything.
RHI: So, she comes downstairs, sees you, raises an eyebrow, and strolls over. “Well, I’m surprised to see you here.”
JOSIE: “Surely you didn’t think I would stay away for too long, yes?”
RHI: “Well, I thought you might have some sense and do exactly that. Do you have any idea how furious Bazso is about the stunt you pulled last week?”
JOSIE: “I don’t believe that man could get really more furious than he was already.”
RHI: “Oh, you have no idea darling.” She glances past Minx to the other two of you, and her gaze kind of lingers on both of you. Blaire, Myra, neither of you have met her before, but she still looks at you as if she recognizes both of you in some way. Then she kinda shakes her head. “Come on, let’s sit down and hear what you have to say. I’m guessing that it’s something to do with your work, if you’re coming here with friends.”
JOSIE: “Well, yes, business is what brought me this way, but it also occurred to me that you haven’t met them yet, and they’re quite good fellows.”
RHI: “Yes, they uh, certainly seem that way.”
KIM: Blaire waves very tentatively at her.
JOSIE: “And they’re certainly much less of a hassle than I am.”
RHI: “Well, that’s damning with feint praise, it seems. It’s lovely to meet you both.” She gestures over towards a cluster of four chairs around a small table, and she waves a hand at the bartender who comes over with four empty wine glasses and a corkscrew for the bottle of wine that you have. Never mind the fact that it’s like 11:30 in the morning.
JOSIE: Right. (laughs)
RHI: Yeah. She sits and just sort of looks the three of you over, and finally her gaze settles on Minx, and she asks, “So, what does bring you here?”
JOSIE: “Well, it occurs to me that while I am quite familiar with the finer things of certain circles of the city I am less familiar with the social life of such things, and your work has introduced you to many a kind, and I was wondering if there was anyone beneficial we could talk about.”
RHI: I think at this point you’re gonna need to give me some kind of roll.
JOSIE: I kind of wanna push myself on this.
RHI: Okay. Do you remember what happened last time?
MINNA: (laughs)
JOSIE: (tentatively) Yeah…
RHI: If you want to, I will not stop you, but…
JOSIE: Oh! Hi! That’s two 6’s.
RHI: So, you ask if she knows anybody, and she leans back in her chair and kind of rolls her eyes thoughtfully and takes a sip of the wine, and her eyes kind of dart back to you because she realizes that you went out of your way to get not the fanciest thing but one of her favorite vintages, and she smiles. “Well, what specifically are you looking for? I meet a lot of interesting people working here, a lot of boring people too, but all of them have money, darling. So, what are you looking for?”
JOSIE: “Particularly those who are fond of painting, sculpture, the arts. I’ve always been a bit of a trappings and furniture girl myself and wish to broaden my horizons.”
RHI: “I see. I assume you’re looking for someone who would be open to a visit.”
JOSIE: “Exactly.”
RHI: “Hmm…” She takes another sip and looks sort of thoughtful. “Oh, I know. Lord Winfield, Clark Winfield, owns some of the factories in Coal Ridge, I think they’re copper production or something like that, but he’s also quite the art collector, and he’s recently come into a brand new collection by some mysterious up and coming artist. It’s all very enigmatic. He’s established a new gallery in his manor to host all of this work. I believe he is throwing some sort of party to show off his newest collection.” And with a critical success, you can ask basically anything, and she has all kinds of details.
JOSIE: I think I want all the details on who this guy is and what he likes.
RHI: Yeah. He is fairly young, has come into his fortune recently after his parents passed away, he’s only held the title for a few years. He likes art, he has an extensive collection. It’s primarily paintings. He has some other works, some tapestries, some sculptures, that sort of thing. Before he assumed the title he was very much a socialite. Since he’s taken over, you know, everyone kind of expected when he took over the title and the family businesses that he was going to be very irresponsible and run the place into the ground, but he’s actually been quite successful. He’s made the factories more profitable in large part by being fairly ruthless about strike breaking, finding places where he can squeeze wages, getting more hours out of people for less pay, that sort of thing.
JOSIE: I want to know his personality.
RHI: He’s a pretty friendly, outgoing guy so long as you’re somebody that he has an interest in, be that you’re nobility or that you’re of some use to him. Nyryx has never really seen him dealing with people that he doesn’t like, so she can’t really speak to that in particular, but based on what he said she’s guessing that he can be kind of a hard ass. Stuff he likes to talk about… he likes to talk about his art. Also, to the disappointment of some of his friends from his younger days, he likes talking business. He has recently been interested in expanding, he’s making a lot of profit and he wants to invest that into the family holdings, he’s just not sure where he wants to go with it yet.
JOSIE: Mm. Also, what is his favorite color?
RHI: Blue.
JOSIE: Blue. Okay.
RHI: So, anything else you want to ask her right now?
JOSIE: Not about Lord Clark Winfield. Otherwise I think I just want to spend this time chatting, if it doesn’t drive these two insane.
RHI: As the conversation about Winfield dies down, Nyryx glances over at Myra. She finishes off her glass, sets it down on the table, and says, “Um, sorry, can I speak to you alone for a moment?”
MINNA: “Alright.”
RHI: So, she stands up and leads you off to the other side of the room. She looks you up and down, and as she does that something in her face kind of shifts. It’s not like a change of emotion, it’s like… well, Myra, I think you might be a little familiar with this. It’s like something else is looking out through her eyes. She gives you this really sad smile and says, “I’m so sorry that whoever was with you hurt you so badly.”
MINNA: “How did you know?”
RHI: “There’s marks that get left behind on a person when it’s not willing, when it’s someone who left in a lot of… I can tell that whoever, whatever the spirit was, it was someone who left with a lot of pain, and fear, and hate, and it left its marks.”
MINNA: “How can you be living with it like this?”
RHI: Her eyes kind of shift, and she looks like the person you’ve been talking to for the last hour, and she shrugs. “They’re not all bad. A lot of them are, but—“
MINNA: “She wasn’t bad! Let’s get that straight. I don’t know why you feel the need to talk to me about this.”
RHI: “I just… I’m sorry.” (sighs) “I saw it, and I, I just wanted to say something. I’m sorry that I upset you.”
MINNA: “There’s nothing you can do for me about this. I don’t know why you thought… Whatever.”
RHI: “I’m sorry.” Is Myra just gonna walk off?
MINNA: Yeah…
JOSIE: When you come back, Minx is in the middle of an explanation to Blaire about some painting she saw one time. “Well, you see, the black speaks to the inner soul of the—“
KIM: “I cannot tell you how much I do not care.”
MINNA: “Let’s go.”
JOSIE: “So suddenly?”
MINNA: “Yes, suddenly.”
JOSIE: “We were just getting a good conversation going.”
MINNA: “Cool. You can have the conversation as we walk.”
KIM: “O…kay.”
RHI: Nyryx comes back over and is keeping a distance.
JOSIE: “Sorry for the sudden departure, Nyryx. It was god to see you.”
RHI: “It’s alright. It was my fault. I overstepped.”
JOSIE: “Oh. Hmm.”
RHI: “Not like that, you.”
JOSIE: “I know. You think so low of me. Jeez.”
RHI: “Only because you give me reason to, darling.”
KIM: “Daaamn.”
JOSIE: “So cruel. So cruel.”
RHI: “You know you love it.”
KIM: “She got you!”
MINNA: (laughing) I think Myra is just standing off to the side with her arms crossed very tightly across her chest trying to hold it together.
JOSIE: Minx is incredibly flushed and ready to go right now.
KIM: “Okay bye~!”
RHI: She says, “Be safe out there,” to Minx, and then glances at Myra and says, “Again, I’m sorry,” and she steps back and heads back towards the stairs.
MINNA: I think Myra doesn’t even look at her as she goes.
RHI: So, you guys leave the Red Lamp, you’re out on the street. Do you guys wanna talk about things getting weird at the end there, or just move on?
KIM: Uh, I don’t know. Myra seems like she wouldn’t wanna open up about it right now.
JOSIE: I think Minx is gonna wait to ask until later.
RHI: So, you have a target, you know he’s throwing a party, and Nyryx gave you the details of, oh yeah, the party’s in a few days, it starts at this time, all that stuff.
MINNA: Now we just have to find a way in.
JOSIE: Right. So, one or more of us should case the joint. What does a Setup Action actually do? Because I wanna take some time to establish my noble persona.
RHI: The way the Setup Action is written is that it’s more of an in-score thing, but I think we can do it… You’re trying to setup an identity as an interested art collector. We’ll say that it will help with the Engagement roll.
JOSIE: Okay, and it may not be the optimal thing, but I think it’s going to be very much in character for Minx to push herself on this. She possibly goes overboard in setting this up.
RHI: Yeah. Go ahead and make your roll for Sway.
JOSIE: Cool.
RHI: Oof.
JOSIE: That sucks.
RHI: So, I’m gonna say, what happens is you can’t get face time with anybody. Nobody is willing to talk to you about your newfound interest in art.
JOSIE: Okay.
RHI: While Minx is off trying to chat with people, Myra, Blaire, do you guys wanna do anything? You know where the party’s gonna be, but you need an in.
KIM: I have an idea, looking at our contacts on the shadow sheet. Adelaide and Fitz.
RHI: Yes.
KIM: I figured we could appeal to either of them and try to convince them to have us be their +1 or something and have that be our cover.
RHI: So, for Social, the detail you provide is your social connection, so rather than this be a Gather Info roll, you could just say Adelaide or Fitz is gonna get us in, and just tell me how you convince them.
KIM: I kinda wanna go with Adelaide , just because she also has the nobility.
RHI: Okay, so, tell me about Adelaide . What’s her deal? Why is she a contact to a group of up and coming thieves?
MINNA: She went to either a university you went to or one that Myra’s hung out at.
RHI: I like the idea that she and Blaire knew each other at school.
KIM: But, would that work against us, since I basically got kicked out of school?
RHI: Eh, she doesn’t care.
KIM: Okay!
RHI: This is a good point where you would have crossed over. So Blaire, you would have been a student at the Morlan Hall of Unnatural Philosophy studying all kinds of fun occult things.
KIM: Yay.
RHI: Adelaide, she’s a couple years older than you, and she was a student at the Jayan Hall of Alchemy.
KIM: Ooh.
RHI: But there’s a little bit of crossover between those two areas.
KIM: Yeah.
RHI: So, you guys met, you both took a class together, you ran across each other in the library, and you got along. She’d never met somebody from Tycheros before so she had all kinds of questions.
KIM: Yeah. My family were alchemists, too.
RHI: I was gonna say, yeah, your family are alchemists. Once you mentioned that she had all kinds of questions about how alchemy works in Tycheros. Yeah, you two became friends, and you kept in touch with her after you got kicked out. Where is some place off campus the two of you would hang out?
MINNA: What if it’s just a coffee shop?
KIM: That’s… That’s… (sigh) What about a graveyard? Just to hang out.
(laugher)
JOSIE: God damn.
RHI: Yes! Yes, that’s so good. Yes. Okay!
KIM: There’s like a mausoleum that we both just hung out at, for no reason. We just thought it looked cool.
RHI: God, that’s so good. You send Adelaide a letter. The way I’m picturing this if this were being shot on film is like, you see the letter being written of like “meet at the usual spot,” and then it cuts to this dark, moonlit graveyard.
KIM: yes!
RHI: There’s a row of marble mausoleums.
KIM: Mm-hmm.
RHI: We follow Blaire as she’s weaving her way through the graveyard, and lounging against a wall is a young Akorosian woman. He hair is jet black, but it’s obvious that it’s been dyed that color, and she’s wearing this… it’s a little old fashioned, kind of flowy, lacey, dark gray gown. When she sees you, she straightens up. “Oh, Blaire, it’s so wonderful to see you again.”
KIM: “Sup Addy?” I got in to fist bump her.
RHI: She fist bumps you back. “Oh, I feel like it’s been ages since I saw you. I still can’t believe they kicked you out.”
KIM: “It’s kind of a story. I’d rather not get into it right now, because I kind of have a little bit more pressing things right now.”
RHI: “Oh? Oh, yeah, of course.”
KIM: “Um… Do you like art?”
RHI: “Um, I like some art. Art is a very broad category. There’s a lot of it, I mean, paintings, and sculptures, and music, and…”
KIM: “Yeah, yeah, right, yeah yeah, okay.”
RHI: “What about art?”
KIM: “There’s… My crew is planning an art heist, and—“
RHI: (gasps) “Ooh! That sounds exciting!”
KIM: “Yeah, and we’re thinking about crashing some kind of, you know, rich asshole’s party.”
RHI: “Oh, which—Do you need a list of rich assholes? I know a lot of them.”
KIM: “I bet you do, but I think we already have a name and target.”
RHI: “Who?”
KIM: “Lord Clark Winfield.”
RHI: “Oh. Good choice in rich asshole.”
KIM: “Oh really? That’s good to know.”
RHI: “Mm-hmm. My older sister is just enamored with him, but he’s, ugh, he’s just a prick.”
KIM: “Ick.”
RHI: “Very two-faced, you know?”
KIM: “Oh, I hate that.”
RHI: “Yeah!”
KIM: “Can you get us in there?”
RHI: “I think I can manage that.”
KIM: “You can manage all three of us?”
RHI: “I can pull some strings here. I can get you in the front door, and then I think I’ll have to make myself a bit scarce so that people don’t get too suspicious. Meet back here the night before the party and I’ll get you what you need.”
KIM: “Yeah, because I’ve got nothing to wear…”
RHI: “Yes, I was just going to say—That I don’t believe I can help you with. We are not even close to the same size. You are very short. I can give you the names of a few tailors that might be able to help you out.”
KIM: “I guess. Yeah, I mean, I’m gonna need it.”
RHI: One of the places she gives you is Dundridge & Sons.
JOSIE: Oh, hey, that’s my vice place.
KIM: Oh, hey.
RHI: Yeah, yeah. Minx knows this place well. Their prices are surprisingly reasonable. I imagine you guys chat and catch up for a little bit before she goes swanning off to be dramatic in another part of the graveyard.
KIM: “Next time don’t pose without me.”
RHI: “Next time get here on time.” Is there anything else you wanna do in terms of gathering information?
MINNA: Now that I remember we have those contacts including Fitz the collector, I might gather information just on like the art that we’ll be trying to steal.
RHI: Where do you think Fitz works out of?
MINNA: It makes sense to me that he’s kind of a scout and appraiser, and maybe sometimes buys stuff and sells it on to nobles, so maybe he has an office in Charter Hall or… someplace nice.
RHI: Probably in Brightstone, if he’s doing a lot of work with the nobility. Go ahead and give me whatever roll you’re gonna make.
MINNA: I think it’s gonna be a Consort. I have a 5 and a 6!
RHI: 6, great, so you’re gonna get really good information. You head into Fitz’s office. Tell me about Fitz.
MINNA: I think he is a balding man, very harried all the time, like, he always seems… well, with them at least, you know, get on with your business, I have some work to do, etcetera, but he’s obviously willing to talk to them. I don’t know why he’s willing to talk to them and help out. Maybe he means to acquire things creatively eventually.
RHI: Yeah. He probably gets at least a chunk of his art through questionable means. His office is currently—I feel like it’s always pretty crowded, but it is excessively crowded today. There are a whole bunch of crates that employees are prying open with crowbars, and he is bustling around with ledger inspecting each thing as it gets opened and scribbling down notes, and then talking to the person unpacking it and giving directions. “And this one gets placed in the second storage unit. Make sure that it is placed on proper padding. This one goes in storage unit three with the other paintings. Make sure that the frames are back to back so that the art does not touch. We do not want to ruin the painting. Ugh. Yes? What do you want?”
MINNA: “I thought you might be able to give me a little information that might help us both.”
RHI: (sigh) “You have two minutes.” He snaps the ledger shut and looks at you expectantly.
MINNA: “Party at Lord Winfield’s, found a new collection.”
RHI: “Ah, yes.”
MINNA: “We are planning on taking a little trip there. Is there anything we should prioritize?”
RHI: “Well, a lot of people are very interested in that new collection of his. It’s from some unknown artist. The work is supposed to be exquisite—I haven’t seen it myself of course—but everyone who has viewed it says that it’s done by someone of great talent and gift, and apparently he has made himself this young woman’s patron. This is the first showing of any of her art. I believe these are the first pieces that will be available for display. So, I imagine that if you were to get your hands on any of those works they would be quite valuable. He also has a fairly large collection of twilight impressionist pieces if you would like to liberate any of those.”
MINNA: “Thank you for the information. I’ll try and get you some of that.”
RHI: “Ah, I hope you do. Hmm? Under two minutes. Well done.”
MINNA: “Always, Fitz.”
RHI: So, you guys have a target, actually you have a lot of targets, you got a way in. do you guys wanna try and get some fancy duds?
JOSIE: Yeah!
MINNA: (laughing) You asked if we wanted to get dressed up.
JOSIE: Regarding that, can I have a completely self-indulgent scene real quick?
RHI: Yes.
JOSIE: So, from what I heard, Blaire got redirected to Dunridge & Sons first, so I really like the scene of Blaire coming into this place and then Minx is already there getting fitted for a blue women’s noble suit.
RHI: Blaire and Myra walk in, and Minx is already up on the little stand thing, arms out, in front of all of all these mirrors being measured.
JOSIE: But then she catches a glimpse of you in the mirror and turns, and she’s absolutely beaming. “Finally, this day has come! Come now, we must get you fixed up!” And is definitely pulling Blaire forward by the hands in particular.
KIM: (groans) “I don’t want a dress!”
JOSIE: “That’s fine. That’s fine. There are plenty of suits.”
RHI: So, for Myra and Blaire, you’re both gonna roll your Stash, which is basically each of you are gonna roll 1d6.
MINNA: (laughs) I got a 2.
RHI: Oof, okay. Blaire?
KIM: Ho, I got a 6.
RHI: Okay. One of the tailors who works there sees Blaire with the horns and the very pale eyes and her tasseled hair, and is just like yes, I know exactly what I’m gonna do here, this is gonna be awesome, and just spends like two hours getting you decked out.
KIM: She is very scared.
RHI: But it ends up looking awesome. Myra, I think with Minx and Blaire kind of occupying the attention of the two more experienced tailors, you get stuck with the new guy, who doesn’t do a bad job, but they keep coming out with these very fashionable dresses and suits and things, but none of it is anything that you’re comfortable in, because you like things that are more practical. It’s this push and pull of no, I need something that I can actually move in versus waterfall ruffles are so in this year! So, eventually they find you something, but it is a lot more plain than what the other two have, and probably a lot more plain that what anybody else has there. It’s something that you’re fairly comfortable in.
MINNA: I’ve probably given in on the color, and it’s not black, or dark blue.
RHI: All three of you have your outfits, Adelaide meets with Blaire the night before the party to give her the invitations, and yeah. You guys are ready to go to a fancy party.
JOSIE: Woo!
RHI: The engagement roll ends up being 2d6. So I didn’t roll very well. I got a 3.
(groaning)
So, basically it means you guys are gonna be in a desperate position when you walk in.
JOSIE: Dear god.
RHI: Yeah.
JOSIE: Oh my goodness.
KIM: We were doing so well.
RHI: You guys get in with your invitations, you walk into the Winfield Manor, and it is this big, old, beautiful estate. The front hall is marble floors, these beautiful, black marble pillars with like veins of gold through them, crystal chandeliers, there’s a band playing at the back of the room, people dressed in finery mingling, laughing and talking. And, as you come in, there’s a trio of people talking to one of the security staff, and as you approach, one of the people in the group turns, and Minx…
JOSIE: Oh no.
RHI: …you recognize this person with a sinking heart.
JOSIE: Is it—No.
RHI: Bazso spots you.
JOSIE: How is he here? No!
RHI: You fucked with him. (laughs)
JOSIE: Oh my fucking god.
RHI: So, he turns and looks at you, and catches your eyes, and smirks. He looks back at the security staff and says, “Yes, these are the ones that I warned you about. You should have them escorted from the premises immediately.”

Transcript created by Lyra.
## intro music
RHI: Welcome back to Duskwall. Once again, thank you for joining our band of criminals as they try to talk their way into a fancy party to steal some art.
Also, I forgot to mention this last episode, but we are now on iTunes, Google Play, and Stitcher. Please subscribe and leave us a review, and let us know if there’re other platforms you’d like to see us on. You can email us at magpiepod@gmail.com, or tweet at us @magpies_pod.
Notes on this episode are about the same as last time. No Finn, because Madge was unable to join us for this recording. And, this is the second half of a two-parter, so if you have not listened to episode two, you should go do that.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity. Our first featured charity is your local NAACP chapter. Last December, the Democratic candidate for senator won a highly-contested special election in Alabama, a victory that has pulled some small amount of power out of the GOP’s hands. This victory was due almost entirely to voters of color who were able to overcome systemic voter suppression thanks to the tireless efforts of the Alabama NAACP. Voters of color face continued challenges to their right to vote throughout the country, and local NAACP chapters are among the leaders in championing those rights. If you’re able, donate a few dollars to your local chapter or see if they need volunteers. A link to the national NAACP website will be in the show notes.
Now then, let’s get started, shall we?
## [00:01:45]
RHI: He turns and looks at you, and catches your eyes and smirks, and then looks back at the security staff and says, “Yes, this is the ones that I warned you about. You should have them escorted from the premises immediately.”
MINNA: (gasp)
JOSIE: Alright.
RHI: Desperate. What are you gonna do?
JOSIE: Desperate. Okay, yes, I would like to pull on a flashback. Minx was probably binge studying as best she could on art stuff. Based on results of the earlier roll, that didn’t take. But what did take was all the other stuff she was trying to study up on, learning about his industry, because if there’s something Minx has an eye for, it’s money.
MINNA: Actually, another thing we could do if you want me to do a Flashback Action to give us cover identities?
RHI: Forgery could fall under Study or Finesse.
MINNA: I’m down with either of those. I might wanna push myself ‘cause I only have one die in this. Or accept a devil’s bargain, but I don’t know what that looks like here.
RHI: Your cover identity that you use here is basically not gonna be able to be used for a while because it’s just gonna raise some red flags. You’ll basically have to do an Acquire Asset Downtime Action to get a new cover identity.
MINNA: Okay, I can do that. They both turned up three.
RHI: Since it was controlled, basically, you just work on these documents, and you realize as you’re making them you don’t have enough time. With that in mind, she doesn’t have any documents to back you up. Minx, do you still wanna go forward with trying to bluff your way through this, or do you wanna take another approach?
JOSIE: Yes. I wanna use that flashback of binge-studying things Winfield likes. Perhaps I’ll drop reference to an industry that I’m in, that I’m not actually in, but that would pique his interest.
RHI: Yeah. Basically, you’re doing a flashback as a Setup Action for yourself.
JOSIE: Yes.
RHI: And this is obviously gonna be a Study.
JOSIE: Mm-hmm. I have no ranks in Study, but I’m going to spend two stress to use Rook’s Gambit, and use my best Action Rating, which is Sway, instead. This is a five.
RHI: Okay. So, you can either improve the effect level or improve the position. That basically means it will be a desperate roll with greater effect or a risky roll with standard effect.
JOSIE: I think I’m gonna go desperate, greater.
RHI: Make your roll. Would you like any kind of devil’s bargain on this?
JOSIE: Yeah. I was about to ask what that looks like.
RHI: Yeah. Let’s see here. I mean, it’s gotta be something with Bazso again. He’s just gonna be…
JOSIE: I do keep meaning to go have a scene with him, but things just keep…
RHI: The thing is, his gang is actively engaged in a war right now. You have pissed him off that badly. I think the devil’s bargain will be that this is gonna drop your rating with the Lamp Blacks to -2.
JOSIE: Okay, yeah. You can’t push yourself and devil’s bargain, right?
RHI: Somebody could help you. Somebody could take a point of stress to assist you on this in some way.
MINNA: Yes.
RHI: You could brandish your cover identity, ‘cause then that tracks with your devil’s bargain if that cover identity gets burned.
MINNA: Yep.
RHI: So you’ve got a bonus d6 from the devil’s bargain and a bonus d6 from Myra helping you.
JOSIE: Six and two fives.
RHI: You do it!
JOSIE: Yes!
RHI: You just do it. What do you say that gets Winfield’s attention and gets you out of this?
JOSIE: “Oh, come now. There’s hardly anything to fear from me, unless, of course, you are looking to get into the tailoring business. That’s not gonna be a good time for you right now. I’m Lady Felix, by the way, Tycherosi Imports Industries.”
RHI: As you’re talking, Winfield glances over, sees the three of you, and strolls over, and is like, “Lady Adelaide mentioned you to me. It’s so wonderful to meet you, Lady Felix.” He takes your hand and kisses it. As he does that, he just waves Bazso aside, kind of elbows him out of the way, and Bazso is just staying at you like, “How? How did you do that?”
JOSIE: As we’re walking away with Lord Winfield, I give him a look and a shrug that says, sort of, “Did you expect any different?”
RHI: He glares at you and stalks off somewhere.
## [00:06:17]
RHI: Lord Winfield leads you over to the bar, gets each of you a glass of very fine champagne, leans against the bar, and is like, “I have had so many offers for different investments, and you are one of the very few whose actually seemed interesting. Everyone else thinks, ‘Oh, he owns copper factories. He must want to branch out into steel or iron, or…’ (sigh) But you, from what Lady Adelaide told me, have something unique going on.”
JOSIE: “That is indeed accurate. And I must sympathize with that feeling a bit, too. There is a reason I got into this business in the first place.”
RHI: “Of course, of course. Oh, Nessa! Come here, meet these people.” And a young woman… It looks like she has Severosi heritage: very dark skin; dark, wiry hair that has been braided back in this very elaborate hairstyle; wearing a gorgeous gown. Minx, you, at least, can identify this as very fine Iruvian silk. You can also tell the dress is wearing her. She is not comfortable in any of this getup.
She smiles tensely and walks over, and is like, “Yes, Lord Winfield. You have someone else for me to meet?”
He’s like, “Yes, yes. This is Lady Felix and her entourage. They’re setting up some work with Tycheros. Don’t you think that would be such a wonderful place for you to visit, get truly inspired to begin working on your next set of paintings?”
She just smiles nervously and goes, “Yeah. Yes, that would be lovely.”
JOSIE: “Be still my heart. Is this the artist herself?”
RHI: “Yes. Hello.”
JOSIE: “Charmed to meet you.”
RHI: “I’m Nessa Eriks. Hi.”
A couple things that I think Minx and Myra, particularly, pick up on. Minx, you have picked up on: this is not her scene. She is not comfortable here. Myra, you can’t exactly pin it down. Maybe it’s the mannerisms, maybe it’s some of the phrasing she’s using a little bit; an accent. She grew up in the same neighborhoods you did.
JOSIE: Is she sticking around in our conversation with Lord Winfield?
RHI: He is trying to draw her out and seems a little annoyed that she’s being so nervous. He’s like, “Forgive me. I have to make the rounds. I absolutely do want to talk with you later. Please, enjoy yourselves, view the art! She is an incredibly talented young woman.”
JOSIE: Minx is gonna head off to socialize, but before she does, she’s gonna nudge Myra a little bit and nod towards Nessa.
KIM: I think I will go with Myra.
JOSIE: My goal with socializing is to just essentially give cover. I don’t want people coming over and socializing with Nessa or these two. I want to give them space to work.
RHI: Myra and Blaire, you two are there with a very nervous-looking young artist.
MINNA: “Ms. Eriks, before you go…”
RHI: “Yes?”
MINNA: “You’re from Charhollow?”
RHI: “Coalridge, but is it that obvious?”
MINNA: “Oh, I’m sure not to most people, but, you know, those parts of the city call out to their own.”
RHI: This look of utter relief washes over her. She’s like, “Oh, okay. Lord Winfield heard about my abilities and, well, patronizing me, you know, giving me money in exchange for my work, and… It’s gonna help out a lot.”
MINNA: “Something of a devil’s bargain?”
RHI: (laughing) “You could say that.” Myra, you can tell she is not being entirely forthcoming with you here.
MINNA: Is this something I should roll for?
RHI: Yeah, you could try to make some kind of roll to get her to open up. Given the circumstances, this is gonna be controlled. You’re not really facing a threat and you’ve already established that the two of you have this in common.
MINNA: My dice have failed me.
RHI: What’d you get?
MINNA: A three.
RHI: A three. Okay. You’re studying her and the silence goes on a little too long, and she starts to get uncomfortable. She’s like, “I’m sorry, I’m supposed to be mingling with a lot of different people. But it was nice to meet you.” She’s gonna start to walk away. Basically, you can try again with Consort, but it’s gonna be risky. Or you can try a different approach.
MINNA: I think I’m gonna try to get a consort. Five.
RHI: So, you do it but there is a consequence.
MINNA: I think what Myra blurts out is, “Coalridge. It’s not easy to get out of a place like that. You must have done something.”
RHI: She’d halfway turned away from as she freezes in place. She doesn’t turn back, but she glances at you sideways and is like, “You understand, then. People would do anything to get out of a place like that, to get people they cared about out of a place like that. You understand, right?”
MINNA: “Of course I understand.”
RHI: Both of you get this horrible chill down your spine.
KIM: Oh.
RHI: And you see Nessa shivers, too. Both of you, because of your past experiences, you recognize this. There is a ghost somewhere very nearby.
KIM: (gasp)
RHI: She shivers and then looks around very nervously, and is like, “I’m sorry, I have to go.” She takes off.
MINNA: “You felt that too?”
KIM: “Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I got that.”
MINNA: “Can you tell where it came from?”
KIM: I guess I can roll an attune.
RHI: Does anything happen with your eyes or anything when you’re looking into the ghost field?
KIM: Oh. I like to think maybe they just glow completely blue. I got a one and a five.
RHI: You look into the ghost field and you’re able to see, overlaid over the scene, a couple layers of older versions of this hall; you know, lower ceiling, different pillars, things like that. You can see a few of the guests have clearly imbibed some kind of spirit-based drugs and essences, ‘cause they have that kind of aura around them that you can recognize. The more recently a ghost has died, the more it’s able to hold its image that it had in life. This ghost is fairly recent. Woman; was probably a Skovlander, based on her looks. She’s got blonde hair, light skin. She’s wearing decent clothes. They’re not super-fancy; looks kind of middle class-ish. Her clothes, however, particularly the shirt and vest, are soaked in blood from her throat being cut.
KIM: Oh, god.
RHI: As you turn and make eye contact with her, she just screams “thief!” and lunges at you.
KIM: Oh my god.
RHI: You’re gonna take Level 2 Harm, Ghost-Touched. What happens is, she screams that, she lunges at you, and she goes through you towards Nessa. You can roll to resist this. It’s gonna be with Resolve. What’s your highest?
KIM: Three.
RHI: You’ll take three stress to resist it, but you’ll resist the Harm completely.
KIM: That’s good.
RHI: You see her lunge and you just mentally brace yourself. She just passes through you, but is heading for Nessa. As this ghost lunge for her, she turns around and pulls a pin off of her dress, and holds it up. The ghost hisses and recoils, and floats back through the wall. Blaire, now that you’re looking – Myra, you probably recognize this as well, because you have one – it’s a spiritbane charm worked into the shape of this very elaborate jeweled pin. She stands there and pins the broach back to her dress.
KIM: “Hey.”
RHI: She startles and looks at you.
KIM: “Nessa, right?”
RHI: “Yeah?”
KIM: “Are you okay?”
RHI: “Yeah, I’m fine. Everything’s fine. Why wouldn’t I be fine?”
KIM: “Do you wanna sit down?”
RHI: “I’m fine. Lord Winfield said I need to go and talk to people and socialize, so I should go do that.”
KIM: I’m gonna grab her wrist and be like, “Hey, what was that about?”
RHI: “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She tries to pull her arm away.
KIM: I still hold on. “The ghost just now, what was that about? Are you okay?”
RHI: “I’m not supposed to… I can’t, okay?”
KIM: “Okay, but what can you? Because I might be able to help.”
RHI: “What, like, make it go away?”
KIM: “Maybe.”
RHI: I think you’re gonna need to make some kind of roll to convince her.
KIM: I guess Sway.
RHI: I think it’s gonna be risky, ‘cause she’s very shaken up and is not super onboard with this.
KIM: Ugh. Three.
RHI: I think what it is is this is reduced effect. She jerks her arm from you and is like, “I’m sorry, but I can’t talk about this, and I… If you wanna know more, go look at the gallery.” Then she strides off.
KIM: Oh, damn. I guess I have to look at shitty art.
## [00:15:34]
RHI: So, Minx. What have you been up to this whole time?
JOSIE: I have hopefully been having the time of my fucking life, because Minx lives for this shit.
RHI: Yeah, you’ve been having a good time chatting with people, socializing.
JOSIE: And mostly, I’m having a great time using binge-study business practices, and also just completely making up shit about Tycheros, ‘cause no one knows what Tycheros is about anyway.
RHI: You’re talking to some enraptured nobility. One of them is just like, “So there’s really half-demon spiders that produce the silk?”
JOSIE: “Indeed.”
RHI: “Is that safe to wear?”
JOSIE: “It is quite safe to wear, I assure you. What little danger there is is weaned out through a very extensive process, because while these spiders can produce silk in very large quantities, it takes quite a bit of filtering, as it were, to make it totally safe. But once it is, it is the softest.”
RHI: You hear a bit of a commotion behind you and see Nessa, looking panicked, hustling away from your companions.
JOSIE: I’m gonna politely excuse myself from that conversation. Where is Nessa heading?
RHI: She seems to be heading towards Lord Winfield, who is chatting with some other people on the other side of the room.
JOSIE: Ah, that’s perfect. I’m gonna make my way back towards them again.
RHI: You catch up with the two of them. She pulls him aside. You get close just in time to hear the end of a whispered exchange of her going, “It happened again! How many times is this gonna keep-”
And then he goes, “Don’t worry about it. You are here to play a role. That thing will be dealt with. And you know you’re not supposed to talk about this! Not here.” Then you get up close and he looks up and puts on the smile again and is like, “Lady Felix! Ah, wonderful. I was just going to come over to talk to you.”
JOSIE: “Oh, then this is a fortuitous coincidence. I just wanted to catch your ear one more time before I headed into the gallery.”
RHI: “Oh, of course, of course. What did you want to speak with me about?”
JOSIE: Yeah, I think I’m just gonna shoot the shit with him.
RHI: Talk some more business?
JOSIE: Yeah, again, I’m sort of socially drawing aggro here.
RHI: Yeah, you keep his attention. I think Nessa just keeps standing there awkwardly. He hasn’t given her permission to go off.
JOSIE: “Do you mind if I pull Ms. Eriks away, dear? I’d love to get a tour of the gallery with the artist herself.”
RHI: Yeah. He’s like, “Yes, yes, of course. She would love to tell you all about her works.” He shoots her a pointed look.
She’s like, “Yes, of course. This way.” She does not seem very happy about this, but she’s going.
## [00:18:24]
RHI: All of you end up in the gallery. It is lined with these, actually, quite beautiful… I don’t wanna call them landscapes, because they’re almost exclusively of the Void Sea. They are a little bit abstract, in that if you are painting the sea, which is basically solid black, against the sky, which is also basically solid black, it can be a little hard to distinguish. But there’s really good use of color, and a lot of the paintings have these very detailed, distant ships or shapes moving in the water to break up the difference between sea and sky. There’s also some cityscapes, images of Duskwall. Most of them don’t have people in them; it’s this oddly empty city. There’s about a dozen in the room.
MINNA: Can we see anything ghost-y about them?
RHI: Just looking at them normally, no.
MINNA: Hey, Blaire. Want to attune with me?
KIM: Yes.
RHI: Alright. Group action?
MINNA: It makes sense to me.
RHI: Myra, are you leading it?
MINNA: Sure.
RHI: Go ahead and roll it, and tell me how you guys do.
MINNA: Five.
KIM: I got a six.
RHI: Myra, you take no stress, and you guys just succeed. You guys both concentrate together and look into the ghost field. There’s nothing ghostly about the paintings themselves; they look normal. However, you do see the spirit again. She’s not taking notice of you this time, drifting from painting to painting and standing in front of each and staring at it, and then moving onto the next; just doing a circuit of the room.
MINNA: Oh no. Is she the real painter? Can I go talk to her?
RHI: You can try to, yeah. You two work your way through the crowd over to where the spirit is currently. As she starts to turn to get to the next picture, she sees the two of you.
MINNA: “You care about these paintings, don’t you?”
RHI: “They’re mine! They stole them and they’re mine!”
KIM: “You’re the artist?”
RHI: “Of course I am. I spent my life crafting these, and then he stole them!”
MINNA: “What if we steal them back?” she says very quietly, moving close.
RHI: She just shakes her head and touches her throat. “You can’t steal back what’s been taken.”
MINNA: “What’s your name?”
RHI: She hesitates like she has to think about it for a second. “Thea. Thea Walker.”
MINNA: “What if we put them under your name?”
RHI: She seems to be considering it. You’re gonna have to persuade her.
MINNA: Can that be a consort roll?
RHI: Yeah. This is gonna be risky, because she’s a ghost.
MINNA: One roll is six.
RHI: Oh, okay. She considers you for a long moment. “That would be something. It wouldn’t be enough, but it would be something.” Her gaze flicks up past you. She scowls, then looks back at you and says, “Make both the thieves pay,” then dissipates away. As she had looked up past you guys, Nessa and Minx came into the room.
JOSIE: Minx has no idea as to the specifics of what’s going on, but she did overhear that thing. She’s having a conversation with Nessa. “You know, I have traveled quite far, seen some distressing, frankly strange things in those travels, given where I’ve gone to. I do have considerable resources. If there is something that is bothering you, I would be honored to assist such a wonderful artist in this.”
RHI: She was looking like she was considering your offer until you said “wonderful artist,” and then she cringes and shakes her head. Blaire and Myra, do you wanna join up with them at this point?
KIM: Oh, yeah.
RHI: Okay. You two come over to the conversation. She looks at you two again and is like, “Oh, hello again.” She’s just wringing her hands nervously.
KIM: Blaire just looks at her.
MINNA: “Ms. Eriks! How good to see you again.”
RHI: “Yes, hello. Can I do something for you?”
MINNA: “Oh, you’re with my employer.”
JOSIE: “Ah, yes. We were just discussing strange phenomena of a foreign nature.”
MINNA: “Strange phenomena of foreign nature, you say?”
JOSIE: “Indeed. Is there perhaps an eve or something where we may discuss business?”
RHI: She glances around. There’s a couple of the doors off the gallery that you can head into. The one you go into leads into a study that nobody else is in right now.
JOSIE: We’re gonna take her over and have a seat. Hopefully it’s not too close to the ghost lady.
RHI: “I really am supposed to be mingling with other people for—”
KIM: “You’re mingling with us now.”
RHI: “I’m sorry. I don’t understand.”
KIM: “Good.”
RHI: She just gives Blaire this very confused, frightened look.
MINNA: Myra puts a hand on Blaire’s shoulder and gives her a pointed look.
KIM: Blaire’s pissed!
MINNA: Understandably so. They also have a job to do.
RHI: “What’s going on?”
MINNA: Myra turns to Nessa. “I understand that it’s hard to grow up in Coalridge and to want out. I even understand you might have gone to some quite desperate lengths to do so. However, you have to weigh the risks. This is a city of ghosts, Nessa.”
RHI: When you say that, she just curls in on herself. “No, he made me do it! I didn’t want to be here. I don’t want to be! He didn’t give me any choice. I didn’t wanna end up like her!” Then she touches her throat.
KIM: Oh.
MINNA: I think Myra sits next to her and reaches out, and puts a hand on her shoulder. “You’re mixed up in something a lot bigger than you. The thing is, it’s a about to get a lot more dangerous.”
RHI: “Oh, what? More dangerous than noblemen who sends assassins to kill artists and a ghost who thinks that I stole her work?”
MINNA: “You might be able to help us make this right. Do you know an easy way out of this gallery? A hidden way where no one would see us.”
RHI: “I think there’s the servants’ passages.”
MINNA: “Would they be clear at this time?”
RHI: “Not now. There’s a lot of people moving in and out of them for the party.”
MINNA: “We need to get out secretly.”
RHI: She goes quiet for a minute and is like, “What are you here for?”
MINNA: “We’re here for the art. We’ve reached an accord of sorts with the ghost. I believe that if she sees that you are helping us, that might go some way towards making amends.”
RHI: “Are you trying to steal them?”
MINNA: “Yes.”
KIM: “Yeah.”
RHI: “Oh, okay. I wasn’t expecting you to be that forthright about it, but okay.”
MINNA: “Do they know your crime?”
RHI: “So far, all I’ve done is pretend to be an artist that I’m not. I am an artist, I just didn’t paint these. He wanted me to try to imitate her style and paint more of it. Apparently, it was cheaper to hire me than whatever her asking price was for her art. Maybe I should have asked for more money. Or, I guess if I had, I would have ended up dead.” She buries her head in her hands. “The gallery setup is for tonight. He wanted to have them shown off, but then he’s gonna have everything boxed up and taken to his buyers so he can sell off most of it.”
MINNA: “Do you know where he’ll keep these paintings after they’re boxed up?”
RHI: “Well, they’ll have to be transported out of the gallery. Then he would have them in his vault before they were transported out.”
JOSIE: She wants to get out of here, right?
RHI: “Yeah, out of here would be… Yeah.”
MINNA: “We’ll try and keep you safe if we can get you out of here.”
RHI: She looks over at Blaire and is like, “Is she gonna be okay with that? Cause she seemed really angry at me.”
KIM: “That’s before I knew you weren’t responsible. Don’t worry, it’s fine.”
MINNA: “Blaire, perhaps you can talk to her.”
KIM: “Yeah.”
JOSIE: “I’m afraid I’m gonna have to leave some of that to you two once again. Now that we know who’s to blame, I have something to take care of.”
RHI: Oh, shit.
JOSIE: Yeah. Minx doesn’t get pissed.
RHI: Minx is pissed?
JOSIE: Minx is pissed. He plucks a fucking young, vulnerable girl off the street or out of the slums and is ruthlessly exploiting her.
RHI: Nessa stays with Blaire and Myra, helping you guys figure out the best way to get at the art. Minx?
JOSIE: Mm-hmm. I want to find Lord Winfield again. But once we are talking, I wanna lay it on thick. Just really, really exploit everything I know about him – what I learned from Nyryx and binge studying and stuff like that – and then end the conversation with, it’s overtly having a meeting with the undertone that is a flirt.
RHI: To convince him to go and meet with you alone, you’re gonna have to give me some kind of roll.
JOSIE: That’s gotta be Sway, doesn’t it?
RHI: Yeah. Given you’ve had a bunch of positive interactions with him previously, I think it’s gonna controlled.
JOSIE: Excellent. Six. Yes!
RHI: You talk him up, and he agrees. He says he has to do all this mingling and chatting with people who are so much less interesting with you, but towards the end of the party, he tracks you down again and pulls you off into another private sitting room. He’s gonna walk into the room and he’ll shut the door, like, “Oh, have a seat.” Walks over to the wet bar, gets a couple glasses, and is like, “What’s your poison of choice?” as he’s looking at different bottles.
JOSIE: Can I know his favorite drink?
RHI: Oh, yeah. Nyryx would have definitely been able to get you that.
JOSIE: Yeah. I’m gonna order his favorite drink with one difference.
RHI: You ask for a Dagger Isles rum neat. He’s like, “Oh, I prefer it with a little ice, but I see you are quite a woman of refined taste” as he’s pouring it out. What do you wanna do?
JOSIE: I’m gonna chat with him until he sits down.
RHI: He brings you your drink; sits down on the couch next to you.
JOSIE: I’m gonna give him a look and say, “I’ve been to quite a few places, seen quite a few things, and despite your interests in such cultured things, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an exploitation so brazen.” And that’s when I’m gonna stab him with my sword cane.
RHI: (gasp)
JOSIE: Yeah. I wanna fucking pin him to the couch through the chest.
RHI: You’re gonna have to make a roll. I think you can actually use Finesse for this.
JOSIE: Well, my Finesse and Skirmish are the same.
RHI: Whichever one you wanna roll. It’s gonna be controlled, and I’m gonna give you greater effect, ‘cause he is caught completely off guard by this.
JOSIE: I also have a feeling I know what the devil’s bargain is, but what is it?
RHI: I think the devil’s bargain is you’re gonna leave some kind of evidence behind.
JOSIE: Yeah, I’m gonna take the devil’s bargain. Four.
RHI: You stab him, just run him through the chest, pin him to the couch. He lets out this strangled scream and flails his arm backward and knocks his glass to the floor, where it shatters. He slumps back into the couch and is bleeding out.
JOSIE: As he’s bleeding, I say, “You look better in red.”
RHI: The consequence is that he made noise, so people outside are going to be, possibly, coming to investigate.
JOSIE: I’m gonna bolt.
RHI: Are you gonna meet up with the others or are you just gonna bail?
JOSIE: I’m gonna bail.
RHI: I think what we see is you running down out of the manor. In the distance, we hear the tolling of the death bell. You see, across the city, a few crows take into the air and start circling.
## [00:30:33]
We cut to Blaire, Myra, and Nessa. I think that at this point, the party has wound down. Nessa found a place where you guys could hide out and avoid detection until the party is ended. Now there are people out packing up the paintings and wrapping them up, putting them in crates, and stuff. How do you wanna get these paintings out of here?
KIM: How many can we take, realistically?
RHI: If you guys are carrying them out of here yourselves, it’s gonna be one apiece. However, if you want to do a flashback where you’ve arranged for, say, some of your buddies in the cabbies to be hanging out nearby with a cab, you could load up probably six to eight.
KIM: I like that.
MINNA: I can do that if you want.
KIM: Yeah.
RHI: You guys have a member of the cabbies loitering outside, waiting for you. Really, what you need to do is figure out a way to get the employees out of the room. There’s four servants packing up the paintings. Nessa’s peering out there, as well.
KIM: “What’s up, Nessa?”
RHI: “Well, I was just… Do you have any ideas? ‘Cause I kind of have an idea.”
KIM: “What’s your idea?”
RHI: “Well, the ghost, Thea, she’s been around here a lot. The servants have been nervous about her. So, I don’t know if you can find her again and maybe get her to scare her off.”
KIM: “That’s not a bad idea. I’m not sure if she could comply, but it’s worth a shot.”
RHI: “I mean, I was gonna say ‘what’s the worst that could happen?’ but there’s a lot of really awful things that could happen, so I’m just—”
KIM: “I can handle it.” Blaire winks at her.
RHI: It’s still gonna be risky, ‘cause you’re dealing with an angry ghost, even if it’s an angry ghost who’s been a little bit mollified by things. But you’re gonna be at greater effect. Basically, what it’ll mean is, if you’re able to convince her, she will probably be able to scare everybody off very quickly.
KIM: Oh no.
RHI: I think it’s just gonna be you lose this opportunity. You look around for her and she doesn’t seem to be here.
KIM: Shoot.
MINNA: I think Myra’s gonna turn to Nessa. “Is there any sign she usually makes that lets them know she’s here?”
RHI: “Cold wind, chandeliers rattling. Sometimes there’s screaming.”
KIM: “We could probably stage a fake arrival.”
MINNA: Is there a vent in here?
RHI: Yeah, up in the wall.
MINNA: Can we climb into a vent and use the screaming from there?
KIM: That’d be fun.
RHI: I think Blaire’s probably the only one who could fit, but yes.
KIM: Yeah. I don’t mind.
MINNA: I’m trying to think if there’s a way that I could do a fake cold wind. I don’t think there is.
KIM: Wait. I think maybe somehow getting a way to shake the chandelier and also just screaming in the vents would probably, hopefully, be enough.
RHI: The screaming part, I think you can just do. If you wanna shake the chandelier, any kind of physical action, you’re gonna be at -1 die because of that whole recovering gunshot wound thing.
KIM: Right. I can handle the scream. I’m feeling if I do it right, the scream could be enough.
RHI: You clamber up in there. I’m gonna do a fortune role to see how effective your screaming is. Pretty effective! On your couple initial ghostly screams, three out of the four servants just book it. One of them is just like, “No, not again. Not this time. I’m not-“ Then you scream again, and they’re just like, “(whimpering) This is fine! I’m putting this painting in this box.” Third scream (fearful cry), and he leaves.
KIM: Nice.
RHI: The room is currently clear. I think you guys are able to get in there. As you guys are starting to collect the first set of paintings, you hear the death bell. You all realize Minx has been gone for quite a while.
MINNA: Myra just meets Blaire’s eyes. They’ve probably both saw her be angry.
KIM: Yeah.
MINNA: She’s gonna have to make her own way out.
RHI: You guys make it out. You get eight paintings.
KIM: Awesome.
RHI: Are you guys gonna bring Nessa with you?
MINNA: Yes.
RHI: Okay. She goes with you guys. I imagine not back to your lair, but…
MINNA: We take her to Rigney.
KIM: Aw, there you go.
RHI: You guys walk in. He looks you guys up. He’s like, “Well, you guys are very dressed up. I didn’t know you got this dressed up. This is impressive! Where is Minx? This seems like her doing.”
KIM: “Do not get used to this.”
RHI: Alright.
MINNA: “It’s a special sort of night. We have someone we’d like to get to a safe place. Would you be able to help us with that?”
RHI: He looks past you two, very nervous. He starts looking at Nessa and he just smiles, like, “I think so, yes. Let me see if I have some clothes that are a little less conspicuous for you. Here, come and sit down.” He ushers her over to the bar and is like, “I’ve got it, don’t worry.”
As you two are going to leave, Nessa is like, “Like I said, I think I’m gonna have to lay low for a while. But thanks for getting me out of that and away from the ghost, and everything.”
KIM: “Don’t worry about it.”
MINNA: “If you’d still be interested in a bit of painting for profit, let us know later.”
KIM: “Yeah, but you take your time.”
RHI: “Yeah. I think I’m just gonna keep my head down for a little bit. But is here a good place to find you again?”
KIM:” Oh yeah.”
RHI: Rigney comes back over with a drink and is like, “Yes, absolutely.”
MINNA: “You know you love us, Rigney.”
RHI: “Yes, I do! The business you bring in!” Minx, I am assuming you went back to The Nest.
JOSIE: Yup.
RHI: Okay. You get back there first. Blaire and Myra, the cabbie that you talked into helping you out gives you guys a lift back to, I assume, the block.
MINNA: Yeah. I don’t think he goes right up to the tower.
RHI: Yeah. Then, you guys, using your underground passages, carry the paintings into the lair; get them stored. So, Minx, what are you doing when the other two get back?
JOSIE: What I’m doing is, I’m in front of a mirror and trying to put myself together a little bit. Her makeup has been running a little bit, she’s been crying a bit, her hair is all frazzled, there’s blood on her sword cane. She’s just trying to get that cleaned up, so her makeup is fixed by the time you get back, but she’s still doing her hair up again.
KIM: Visually, the way I’m imagining this is that, if the camera is on the mirror and we’re watching Minx do herself up, there’s a tilt shift, and you can see Myra and Blaire over her shoulder as they come in.
JOSIE: “Oh, welcome back, dears. I trust the rest of it went smoothly despite some hiccups. I’m sorry; I had to take a detour around.”
KIM: “Yeah… What exactly did that involve, again?”
JOSIE: “Oh, I just have a bit of a sore spot for bluebloods who are keen on taking in a young girl to exploit her. That’s all.”
MINNA: “We heard the death bells tolling as we left.”
JOSIE: “Oh, really? Did things get violent?”
KIM: “Not on our end.”
JOSIE: “Well, I suppose that makes sense. How many artworks did we make out with? Oh, and where’s Nessa? Is she alright?”
KIM: “Did things get violent on your end?”
JOSIE: “Not particularly.”
MINNA: “Minx, you have to be careful. We can’t be doing this on jobs.”
JOSIE: “Oh, it shall not be a regular thing. Circumstances seemed different this time, though, yes?”
MINNA: “Yeah, he was an asshole. There’s a million assholes in this city.”
JOSIE: “This asshole had someone in his clutches, and he was right there.”
MINNA: I think Myra’s basically gonna roll her eyes and stalk further into the apartment. “Nessa’s fine, by the way. Artwork, fine.”
JOSIE: “Excellent. Glad to hear it.” I don’t think Minx has anything else to say on the matter. If other people want to get her alone or talk about it at all, she might.
KIM: I think Blaire is gonna drop it.
MINNA: Same, although Myra’s clearly making her unhappiness known; just general cold shoulder kinda thing happening.
RHI: Things are a little awkward around The Nest. Probably the next day, I assume, you guys, again, probably wrangle one of your cabbie buddies into giving you a ride with all of your stolen goods over to where Fitz works. You were able to lift eight paintings.
JOSIE: Sweet.
RHI: Fitz will offer you 1 Coin per painting.
KIM: Nice.
RHI: I don’t know if you guys want to keep one as a memento. I know that that was Minx’s-
JOSIE: I would like to keep at least one. We do have a bit of a bare wall.
RHI: If you guys keep one, that’ll be four coin you can put into your treasury, and then one coin for each of you.
MINNA: That sounds good. I assume one of the ones we keep is one of those cool ones of the Void Sea.
JOSIE: Yeah.
RHI: Do you guys tell Fitz about the original artist?
MINNA: Yeah. Myra’s gonna pull him aside. She made that promise.
RHI: You explain that to him. He nods and goes over to one of the desks in his office, pulls out this little kit, takes out a couple little jars and some brushes, mixes some weird oils together, and brushes over the signature on one of the paintings. It was Nessa’s signature. That comes off and reveals Thea’s signature on there. He’s like, “Okay, I see. Yes, I will make sure that these are all properly attributed.” He gives you the money for the seven paintings that you are selling to him. In terms of rep, again, mostly because it’s how much space you have left for rep, that fills up your rep meter. And you’ve got 8 Coin, so you can advance in tier.
JOSIE: Let’s do it.
RHI: You guys are now Tier 1, Weak Hold. That’s your payoff. Now, we gotta talk heat.
JOSIE: Mm-hmm.
RHI: I was gonna say low exposure, except for the fact that Bazso was there and he IDed you. It’s gonna be two for a standard exposure. Brightstone counts as hostile turf, so that’s another one. And another two because Minx murdered a dude in his study and left him to bleed all over a very expensive sofa. That’s gonna be a total of five more heat. Let’s talk downtime activities. Blaire, after this score wraps up, the three of you have drifted off, gone your own directions. What do you do with your time?
KIM: Blaire goes back to the Physicker. She hasn’t been taking it as easy as she probably should have, but the wound is still healing. I think the Physicker is lecturing her. But Blaire is not really listening. She is very deep in thought. What Minx had said and hadn’t said is very much on her mind. She reaches into her pockets and she looks down, and she just fidgets with one of the acorns she has for a little bit.
RHI: That’s what Blaire is up to, how she’s spending some of her time getting a little bit more patched up. Minx, what do you do with your time?
JOSIE: What neighborhood was Nessa from? Coalridge?
RHI: Yeah. She lives in Coalridge.
JOSIE: Okay. I think this is gonna be what I do to train my resolve. While people are out doing things, Minx is gonna undertake another act that’s a act of pure resolve for her. Very much dressed down, these are just normal clothes, and there’s a pretty heavy hat on top, and a jacket. It’s just black clothing with a little bit of grime on them. She’s cleaned it up a lot, but these are old clothes for her. I think she’s gonna go to Coal Ridge, find a derelict train car or something in the railyard, sit up on top of it with a little waterskin that has wine in it instead of water, and detox for a bit and remind herself of the kind of place she came from and where Nessa came from.
RHI: It’s loud. There’s a lot of noise from the factories, from the carts of coal being hauled away from the mine, and it’s filthy. There’s constant smoke in the air. You know that you are gonna have to bathe for an hour to get all of this off of you tonight. You see a lot of people running around; miners heading to or from the mine. The mine is open constantly. You see people leaving the factories and you see some kids running around among some of the merchants; the people who aren’t from this neighborhood, the people who are passing through, the people with money. You recognize what they’re doing, the ones that all run up. Five of them start tugging on pant legs so that the mark can’t tell which one of them is reaching into a pocket and lifting some coin. It reminds you very much of where you came from, and, in a way, of, on one hand, how far you’ve come, but in another sense, how much farther you still have to go.
JOSIE: Do they fail to get any of their marks?
RHI: Oh, no. They’re pretty successful. These kids know what they’re doing.
JOSIE: Minx smiles a bit at that, actually, but then gets a wave of ennui as she remembers Bazso and all that, and decides it’s time to go.
RHI: Okay. Myra.
MINNA: Which university or which college would be best to go research this at?
RHI: You would definitely be, basically, back at Blaire’s old stomping grounds: Chartehall University, the Morlan Hall of Unnatural Philosophy. The focus of that school is on demonology and the occult, and, officially, their stance is, “We teach people about these things so that they can understand how to defeat them, because demons and spirits are bad.”
MINNA: (laughing) Yeah, right.
RHI: But in truth, that hall of learning is home to at least half a dozen different, competing cults that are all vying to recruit students and teach them their own particular brand of arcane mysteries. You’re not so concerned with all that, though. You’re just concerned with what they have in their library. Not all of the students at Charterhall have access to this library, but you made sure that your forged student pass had all of the right symbols and signatures to make sure you would be able to get in. You ask the right sort of questions to get some books on arcane artifacts and histories of the city. The Blood Iron Ring isn’t a super well-known artifact, so you have to do a lot of digging to find any mention of it. But, in some old histories, you find mention of it, mostly talking about the evils of consorting with spirits, and, particularly, the dangers of vampirism. You know that vampires happen, essentially, when a spirit moves into a dead body and reanimates it and gives it unnatural life and strength and ability. What you’re able to find about the Blood Iron Ring is that it was forged some centuries ago by a sorcerer who was obsessed with the power of vampires. According to the books that you read, which themselves are citing old legends and tales passed down through generations, they say that the iron that made up the ring was drawn from the blood of a single sacrificed human. A lot of the stories say that the human sacrificed was the sorcerer’s son. You’re not quite able to find in these records, at least so far in your research, what the ring does or how it works, but you do find mention in several places that people who have worn the ring have eventually been found, arrested, and convicted of cannibalism. That does seem to have a little bit of truth to it. You look at when some of those mentions are. You’re able to dig back through archives of newspaper reports and criminal reports, and find, oh, okay, yeah, there was somebody around this year who was arrested for murdering 10 people and eating their faces. That’s what you’re able to uncover so far. You’re still not sure what the ring does other than some kind of tie to vampiric powers, which could mean a lot of things. You don’t know what it looks like or, most importantly, where it is right now, but you’re starting to get some information.
MINNA: I think as she reads this, she definitely shudders at least a good few times. But this is the kind of thing you run across when you research the occult.
RHI: Yes.
JOSIE: We just ranked up, right? I think we should do something to assert our authori-tah.
RHI: Planning on, for lack of a better phrase, and I hate myself for this pun, spread your wings a little bit-
JOSIE: Yay!
MINNA: (Cheering)
RHI: Some ideas for next time, and we’ll see what happens.

Transcribed by Tyler.
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining the crew of the Magpies on their latest score. If you like what you hear please leave us a review or tell your friends about us. Now, Kim is going to talk a bit about this month’s featured charity.
Kim: Last year the music world lost one of its most influential voices in Chester Bennington, lead singer of Linkin Park, who died by suicide in July. Since his passing there has been an outpouring of love and support from within the community, but also a desire for change.
320 Changes Direction, which is spearheaded by Chester’s wife Talinda, aims to offer resources and support to those suffering from depression and addiction and to change the way that we think and talk about mental health. To learn about the five signs of emotional distress, make a donation, or take the pledge to be a part of the culture for change, visit www.changedirection.org. Together we can end the stigma that surrounds suicide and depression, and make Chester proud.
Rhi: If you have a few dollars to spare, please consider donating.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## [0:01:16]
Rhi: This is probably a couple days after the last score.
Madge: I’m guessing we’re at The Nest. Right?
Kim: I like to think we’re in the common room sitting around a table.
Minna & Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: And Minx is not there, right?
Josie: I’m probably nearby. I’m probably off doing my hair or something.
Madge: Phin is in her usual spot and she’s sort of trying to squeeze the rest of the river water or sea water out of her boots, because she’s been on a boat for the past couple of days and it just won’t leave.
Kim: Blaire is completely leaned over the table with her arms crossed and her chin resting on top of it, and she’s like swinging her feet.
Rhi & Madge: Aww.
Minna: I think Myra’s just kind of sitting normally. I mean, I think sitting normally for her is just fairly upright.
Minna (as Myra): So, how was your trip on the Void Sea?
Madge (as Phin): It went okay. It’s been a while since I’ve actually been out there. Things stick around a lot longer than I thought they would.
Madge: And she gives her boot a little shake.
Kim (as Blaire): Actually, can I have some of that?
Madge (as Phin): Go for it.
Kim: Blaire takes out a very small vial out of one of her pouches and she just gets a sample of that sea water.
Madge (as Phin): I heard some fun stuff happened while I was away.
Kim (as Blaire): There may or may not have been a murder.
Madge (as Phin): Oh. I was just talking about the party. Someone got murdered?!
Minna (as Myra): Unfortunately, yes.
Madge (as Phin): What kind of person?
Minna (as Myra): It was a bit of a messy night. The man who died was a Lord Clark Winfield. He was the host of the party we were infiltrating. Minx disliked him for obvious reasons. Suppose she decided to take care of him for good?
Madge (as Phin): [laughs] Are you serious?
Kim (as Blaire): We’re pretty sure it was her.
Minna (as Myra): We heard the bells tolling as we were about to leave.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, and like, when we got back to The Nest she was like fixing herself up, but obviously she was covered in blood earlier. You could just tell.
Madge (as Phin): Wow. Initiative.
Kim (as Blaire): She kind of went… rogue.
Madge (as Phin): Well, um, I know about going rogue, so I don’t exactly blame her, for that. Um, it happens, but I didn’t murder anyone…
Josie: I think now Minx comes over and says:
Josie (as Minx): Now, now, there’s no proof of anything. We did get what we went there for. Yes?
Madge (as Phin): What did you go there for anyway?
Josie (as Minx): The art, obviously. Do you not see the new painting?
Madge (as Phin): Oh.
Rhi: Yeah. There is a new painting hanging on one of the walls. I imagine Minx has set it in a place of honor.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): It really brings the room together, don’t you think?
Madge (as Phin): So, did we get any coin?
Minna (as Myra): Yes, we did.
Madge (as Phin): Aw, that—I mean, don’t get me wrong, Minx. The painting is great, beautiful, artistic… I don’t know art words.
Kim (as Blaire): Ick.
Madge (as Phin): But the coin is more important.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. On the whole, except for the murder, it was quite a successful outing. We may even have a contact in the future in the artist, Nessa, who escaped. We’ll have to wait and see whether things cool down for her, though.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, it could be a while, especially if there are people accusing her of the murder when we know it wasn’t her.
Madge (as Phin): Then why don’t we blame someone else?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, shit. Can we?
Madge (as Phin): I mean, it shouldn’t be too hard.
Josie (as Minx): Well, what’s another gang that runs in high class circles?
Madge (as Phin): Well, The Red Sashes are pretty hoity-toity, well-to-do.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, that’s perfect. Aren’t The Lampblacks at war with them?
Madge (as Phin): Exactly.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent.
Madge (as Phin): So, we send one of theirs, heat cools down on the artist, we can communicate with them some more, get some more jobs, and then we get an in with The Lampblacks because we did them a favor and they’ll have to do one for us in return. I’m not seeing how this doesn’t work out for us.
Josie (as Minx): Well, the Lampblack alliance might be a bit more of an ongoing effort than that. I’m sorry about that. Anyway… But yes, that’s a good idea.
Madge (as Phin): Um, wait, no. No. We’re not going anyway. We’re gonna backtrack on that. Why?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, well, the leader and I have crossed paths on occasions, not really friends, more of acquaintances really, but we’ve had a few differences of opinion in the past.
Minna (as Myra): Wasn’t the leader the one that was trying to stop us at the party?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. Yeah. That was him. His name’s Bazso Baz.
Madge (as Phin): What did you do to him?
Josie (as Minx): I was just completing the job and getting what we needed out of there, but he disagreed with my methods, so… It’s nothing big. I’m sure if we do something for him and talk with him a little bit it can be resolved, but it may be a bit more than one task is what I’m saying.
Minna (as Myra): Well, whatever we do we’re going to have to be careful about this, because if we’re getting involved in a war between two other gangs there’s a big possibility of it blowing up in our faces.
Madge (as Phin): We’ve done it before. Oh wait, that went terribly wrong.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. Yeah. So, let’s not count our coins before they’re in the vault.
Josie (as Minx): It would be nice to have someone to pin this on.
Madge (as Phin): So, I think our first order of business is finding a mark.
Minna (as Myra): That’s a good place to start.
Josie (as Minx): What do we know of The Red Sashes on a personal level?
Minna: Would any of us know anything about them?
Rhi: So, Phin and Minx, it sounds like we’ve established you don’t really have any connections there. Myra, it’s possible that you might, in your previous life working with Salia, might have had some connections there. It’s not like a surefire thing, but if you wanna say that she had some dealings with them…
Minna: I feel like she’d be vaguely aware of them at least, because I do think that maybe some of Salia’s operations were in Crow’s Foot.
Rhi: Yeah. Now, I think your past dealings are at minimum going to be about a year old at this point, if not older.
Minna: Oh, yeah. Definitely. Probably older.
Josie (as Minx): Of course we could, if we do want to go for the warring gangs angle we can always send a friendly letter to Bazso and see who he wants put away. This way it won’t really be reliant on them to do anything. We just get a name.
Minna (as Myra): Well, we know that some of The Red Sashes are quite highborn. We could try to find out if any of them were at that party.
Josie (as Minx): Now there’s a thought.
Minna (as Myra): Because it’s going to be a lot more plausible if they were there.
Josie (as Minx): I imagine the guest registry is still intact somewhere. It’s a question of whether it’s still in the mansion or if it’s been taken in as some sort of evidence.
Madge (as Phin): I mean, knowing the investigators, it’s most likely with them.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. Or honestly, the safest route is probably talking to Bazso. Perhaps not safest for me, but…
Minna (as Myra): One of us could talk to Bazso, and then somebody else could go after some information about the guest list.
Josie (as Minx): That’s true.
Minna (as Myra): Would you like me to go to Bazso?
Josie (as Minx): That would be—That would be much appreciated.
Minna (as Myra): I assume that it wouldn’t go well if it was you.
Josie (as Minx): I feel as though I am somewhat damned if I do, damned if I don’t. if I don’t go he might be upset about that, but he will likely have much more polite words with you.
Minna (as Myra): I’ll give him your regards.
Rhi: So, Myra, you’re gonna go chat with Bazso.
Madge: So, I could scout out a location for The Red Sashes, sort of where they make their base in case we need to infiltrate them and get any sort of evidence.
Rhi: Okay. Yep, you can definitely do that. Blaire, anything you wanna do?
Kim: I’m thinking.
Minna: So, I still think that the guest list is worth looking at if we don’t have anybody doing that right now.
Kim: Oh. I can do that.
Rhi: I mean, Blaire, if you wanted you could try talking to Adelaide.
Kim: Hmm. Yeah.
Rhi: Or, you could try talking to—You guys do have a Bluecoat connection, Laroze, who might be able to get you something.
Kim: I might talk to the Bluecoat guy, actually. I think that would be helpful.
Rhi: So, you guys have all figured out who’s doing what, you scatter out from The Nest, spreading out across the city. Myra, are you going to try to set up a meeting in advance, or are you just going to roll up on their headquarters, and be like ‘hi’?
Minna: Oh. I’m definitely gonna try and set up a meeting in advance. I’m trying to be all legit business meeting with this.
Rhi: Okay. How do you do that?
Minna: Yeah. I’m gonna send an urchin with a note that I would like to arrange a meeting, his place or mine, I don’t mind. I think mine would probably translate to the tavern.
Rhi: Yes. Yeah. I think most people assume that’s your headquarters, but it is not. So, I think you send off that message and it’s gonna take a little while for that to come back, for that to get a reply. So, in the meantime, Phin.
Madge: Yeah?
## [0:10:26]
Rhi: While everyone else is doing all these complicated, convoluted plans with disguises and meetings and shit, you’re just gonna go case a joint.
Madge: Yep. [giggles]
Rhi: Just some good old fashioned thief prep. So, The Red Sashes, their headquarters is a sword fighting school / temple in Crow’s Foot. It is one of the fanciest, if not the fanciest, building in the district. So yeah, you can go in and have a look around without too much trouble. Are you gonna do Survey or Study, or some other way of getting the lay of the land out there?
Madge: Would Prowl work?
Rhi: Prowl is more physical…
Madge: Okay. Yeah. I thought it would be worth a shot, because I made this plan and then I realized that Insight is my worst. So, I’ll do the two and take the lower.
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: Okay, so 3.
Rhi: So, that is not a ton of info. You head over into Crow’s Foot, meander around the area near their headquarters. It’s a very large structure surrounded by a wrought iron fence. They have one courtyard on either side of the building within the fence, and you can see people practicing what you, as somebody who does a lot of fighting, you can tell it’s very fancy sword fighting. You think it has a little too much flourish to it. But, also, unlike the dueling that a lot of the nobles do here which is all just for show, you can tell this sword fighting could really fuck somebody up.
Madge: Ooh.
Rhi: So, unfortunately you get a little distracted watching this.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Eventually somebody comes up to you, an Iruvian man dressed in kind of the uniform that you’ve seen people in there wearing. He just kind of comes up to you and:
Rhi (as Man): [clears throat] Can I help you with something?
Madge (as Phin): Oh! Ah! Don’t sneak up on people. It’s rude.
Rhi (as Man): You’re staring at our school.
Madge (as Phin): It’s fancy.
Rhi (as Man): Yes, it’s a very nice school, but you’ve been staring at it for about half an hour now. It’s a little unnerving.
Madge (as Phin): Is it against the law to stare?
Rhi (as Man): Lots of things are against the law.
Madge (as Phin): But is staring against the law?
Rhi (as Man): [sighs]
Madge (as Phin): What if I just stared at you for half an hour? Would that be better?
Rhi (as Man): Well, you wouldn’t be able to because I’m not going to stand here for half an hour.
Madge (as Phin): What if I followed you?
Rhi (as Man): Unless you are a student or a member of the staff you are not permitted within the school grounds.
Madge (as Phin): I’m not on the school grounds, but okay.
Rhi (as Man): I’m going to go back to the school—[sighs heavily] Please stop staring. You’re unnerving the students, and it’s throwing them off of their practice.
Madge (as Phin): Oh. Do they not like seeing what it’s like when you don’t have daddy’s money backing you up?
Rhi (as Man): Please move on, or I will be forced to contact the authorities and have you removed.
Madge (as Phin): Why?
Rhi (as Man): Because you’re annoying me!
Madge (as Phin): That’s not against the law.
Rhi (as Man): It doesn’t have to be in this town.
Rhi: And he like spins on his heel and walks back towards the gate.
Madge: I make a face, and then I’ll go to the other side of the courtyard [giggles] and stare from that side.
Rhi: So, are you just gonna continue—like, you walk over to the other side of the school, and…?
Madge: Yeah!
[laughter]
Rhi: Okay! So, about another 10 minutes pass, and you see at the far end of the street four Bluecoats, clearly a patrolling squad, come around the corner, look at each other, point at you, and start walking in your direction.
Madge: I stand my ground?
Rhi: They get up to you, and the one in the lead says:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): You need to move on, ma’am. Loitering for this long is against the law.
Madge (as Phin): I’m not loitering.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): You have been standing outside this building for, we’ve been told, about 40 minutes. That is the definition of loitering.
Madge (as Phin): No. I’m not loitering. I’ve been here for 10. I’m waiting for someone.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Who are you waiting for?
Madge (as Phin): My boyfriend.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Well, you’re gonna need to wait for him somewhere else. Move along.
Madge (as Phin): I can’t. He’s blind.
[pause, burst of laughter]
Rhi: You’re gonna have to roll Sway or something to convince them of this.
Madge: [giggles] I got a 2.
Minna: Oh my God.
Josie: Oh man.
Rhi: The lead guard just gives you this scathing look.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): I do not care why you are standing here. What I do care about is that you have been doing it for almost an hour, and the people in that building don’t like it, so you need to move along or we will remove you physically.
Madge (as Phin): You’re awful.
Madge: And I leave.
Rhi: The Bluecoats just stand there and watch you until you are like out of sight, far away. So yeah. [laughing] Due to all of that, you don’t get a ton of information about The Red Sashes headquarters, but you do learn some things about Iruvian sword fighting.
Madge: Yeah.
## [0:15:33]
Rhi: Let’s jump up to Blaire. You were gonna go meet up with Laroze, correct?
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Tell me about Laroze. Who is this person? Why are they working with you guys? Anybody can jump in here.
Josie: Are they perhaps someone who was used to a rougher life than that of the Bluecoats? Like, Bluecoats are supposed to project the image of being like police, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: They’re police, but they’re really corrupt.
Rhi: Yes. So, they’re police.
[laughter]
Josie: Yeah. I’m thinking Laroze is maybe a guy who was once a criminal but now a Bluecoat, so a different kind of criminal, like wanted to be seen as more respectable.
Minna: Who were the people that we were in bad with right off the bat? Maybe he also dislikes them.
Rhi: The Gray Cloaks could be one. The Gray Cloaks and The Bluecoats generally do not get along.
Minna: Was it The Gray Cloaks we stole all our furniture from?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Maybe he just thought that was hilarious.
Rhi: Yeah. I kinda like that.
Minna: So he indulges us sometimes.
Rhi: Where do you want to meet with Laroze? The answer cannot be at any kind of station. You guys have way too much heat on you to be setting foot in a station at this point.
Kim: Yeah. Does he have any like low-brow places he hangs out sometimes, like shady places?
Rhi: Oh, definitely. He likes to hang out at the Leaky Bucket Tavern in Crow’s Foot. The Leaky Bucket is a very criminal friendly establishment because it is run by a former gang leader who retired and opened up the tavern. The only Bluecoats allowed in are the really crooked ones, like Laroze.
Kim: Oh, good.
Rhi: Yeah. You head into the tavern. Laroze is at his usual spot at the end of the bar chatting with one of the bartenders.
Kim: Blaire just moseys on up and takes a seat next to him.
Rhi: He takes a swig, glances over, does a double take.
Rhi (as Laroze): Hey! It’s the little horn girl with the bird gang.
Kim (as Blaire): Horn girl? Really?
Rhi (as Laroze): You’re a girl and you got horns.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m Tycheros. I’m—[sighs] Whatever.
Rhi (as Laroze): And, with horns.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Rhi: He takes another drink. The bartender just catches your eye and shakes her head very sympathetically, and then walks off.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi, Laroze.
Rhi (as Laroze): You know, you have made a lot of noise lately. There’s a lot of people who really wanna see you all in jail.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m aware.
Rhi (as Laroze): Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): So, we’re planning our next score.
Rhi (as Laroze): Mm-hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you remember that party a couple days ago? Or, no, sorry, not the party, the art gallery showing, whatever, thing.
Rhi (as Laroze): Oh, yeah, the art thing. Some bigwig got stabbed.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. It’s too bad, huh?
Rhi (as Laroze): Eh.
Rhi: He takes another drink.
Kim (as Blaire): I need a guest list from that party.
Rhi: Okay, and now you need to make some kind of roll to see if he’s got access to it.
Kim: I would imagine this is a Sway. Oh hey, 6.
Rhi: Seriously?
Minna: Oh my gosh.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Nice! Okay.
Kim: Dang. So that worked.
Rhi: Yeah. A 6 means, he’s like:
Rhi (as Laroze): Oh, yeah, yeah. We were helping the inspectors out, kinda doing all the books with that. Yeah, I can probably get that for you. I’ll make a copy. A copy would probably be better. They ask questions when evidence goes missing, especially when the evidence is really good whiskey, they ask a lot of questions. And then the inspectors get all like up your ass about—
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I get it. I get it. No, a copy’s safer.
Rhi (as Laroze): Yeah. Alright. I’ll, uh… Meet me back here tomorrow and I’ll get it to you.
Kim (as Blaire): Excellent.
Rhi: So, you will have a complete guest list from the party.
Kim: Heck yes.
## [0:19:37]
Rhi: About a day after Myra sends her message to The Lampblacks, a reply is sent to The Hound’s Paw tavern. It just gives a time later that evening and the address of their headquarters which you recognize from the address that that’s where they’re sending you.
Minna (as Myra): Minx?
Josie (as Minx): Hmm? What is it?
Minna (as Myra): Is there anything that Bazso particularly likes that I can bring with me?
Josie (as Minx): He has always been fond of the better sorts of whiskey.
Minna (as Myra): I’ll take a gift with me, then.
Rhi: So you show up at their headquarters at the appointed time. It’s an abandoned coal warehouse, so the whole building is just like permanently caked in black soot. You show up at the front door, there’s a couple thugs standing guard outside, and they look you up and down. One of them leans through the door and says something to someone inside. You have to stand there for a couple minutes while they just watch you. And then, the door opens again and there’s a woman standing there who looks like another guard.
Rhi (as Guard): Come on. He’s in his office.
Rhi: So, she leads you back through the warehouse which has been basically chopped up into a bunch of little, tiny rooms. There’s a very heavy chemical scent in the air that you are pretty sure is the after effect of some of the drugs that The Lampblacks produce and sell. The guard leads you up to the second floor, down a hallway, to an office at the end. She knocks on the door and then pushes it open, and gestures for you to go inside.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi: She nods at you, and says:
Rhi (as Guard): Good luck.
Rhi: And closes the door behind you. Bazso’s office. Actually, I’m gonna throw this one to Josie. What does Bazso’s office look like?
Josie: I’m thinking Bazso is a very extreme Spartacism, kind of pragmatism taken to the extreme here. He has like the absolute minimum in his office because he’s also just super paranoid about people coming in and taking stuff from the expected area. It kind of has a bit of a black motif because Lampblacks, and it’s exceedingly plain and kind of harsh looking.
Rhi: Another thing that you would have noticed as you’re walking through here, Myra, there are no electric lights in this building, anywhere. It’s all old fashioned gas lamps that have to be physically lit. The Lampblacks used to be the lamplighters guild.
Minna: And they’re bitter as heck.
Rhi: Yeah. They were driven out of business by the appearance of electric lights, so yeah, they are bitter. The room is lit kind of dimly because he just has a couple of old fashioned gas lamps on his desk. Bazso is sitting behind his desk, arms folded. He already has an eyebrow raised at you, and as the door shuts he’s like:
Rhi (as Bazso): You have an incredible amount of nerve walking in here. I mean, I admire it, but I can’t tell yet if you have a spine of steel or if you are just incredibly stupid.
Minna: I think without another word Myra is going to pull out a bottle of very fine whiskey and set it on the desk.
Rhi (as Bazso): Eh, maybe just regular kind of stupid.
Rhi: He leans forward and picks up the bottle, looks it over, nods approvingly, sets it back down and gestures at one of the chairs.
Rhi (as Bazso): So, I can’t say that you were the one I was expecting to hear from.
Minna (as Myra): Oh no. I assume you were expecting to hear from Minx.
Rhi (as Bazso): Pff. Is that what she’s going by these days? Yeah, but I guess I also shouldn’t be surprised that she doesn’t have the guts to show her face to me.
Minna (as Myra): We thought it might go a little smoother if we tried sending someone else for this first bit of contact.
Rhi (as Bazso): Oh, you got that right. So, what did inspire this after you dragged my gang into a dust-up with The Bluecoats, and then—I still can’t believe she bluffed her way past the…
Minna (as Myra): Oh, you haven’t come to expect a little bit of nonsense from Minx every now and then?
Rhi (as Bazso): There’s nonsense, and then there’s…
Rhi: He just kind of gestures vaguely and is looking irritated.
Rhi (as Bazso): So what do you want?
Minna (as Myra): Well, we’re after a target, and we thought you might be interested in helping us select that one.
Rhi (as Bazso): [laughs] Okay. This I have to hear. You want me to help? Okay.
Minna (as Myra): Actually, we want to help you. We’re looking to target somebody in The Red Sashes, and I know you have a not great relationship with them, obviously, you’re having a war. I thought you might wanna, you know, point us in the right direction. Who do you want to see gone, Bazso Baz?
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Minna: Is this a Consort?
Rhi: It kinda depends on how you wanna play it. If you do a Consort, he is going to be expecting more information from your side of things.
Minna: I think she’s genuinely trying to form a kind of relationship.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, then go ahead and see how Consort goes.
Minna: This is how she works. She forms relationships. That is a 6 and a 3, so 6.
Rhi: Okay, great. So, he kind of regards you for a long moment.
Rhi (as Bazso): Did she put you up to this?
Minna (as Myra): If you’re wondering, it’s not a setup. We’re honestly trying to make things a little bit less strained between our groups.
Rhi (as Bazso): Alright. Well, between our groups, that’s a possibility. Between me and, uh… Minx? I think that’s something she and I will have to work out on our own. So, you want somebody in The Red Sashes that you can get rid of. Is this a murder get rid of, or…?
Minna (as Myra): Please. Not interested in murder.
Rhi (as Bazso): That’s not what I heard.
Minna (as Myra): Like I told you, my friends can be unpredictable.
Rhi: He just smirks.
Minna (as Myra): This is actually about that. We’re looking to find someone to pin it on.
Rhi (as Bazso): That’s actually pretty clever. Hm. Well, I would’ve said Mylera, she’s the head of The Red Sashes, getting rid of her would be most convenient, but I don’t think that she’d be a reasonable person to take the fall for that, and she’s probably a little bit too big for your level of operations. Let’s see…
Rhi: He leans back in his chair and is thinking for a bit.
Rhi (as Bazso): Okay. I got a name, but if you’re really serious about mending bridges between my organization and yours you’re gonna have to do something else for me, because getting rid of this person, that’s good for both of us.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, of course.
Rhi (as Bazso): I need a show of faith of something that is good for me. Can you agree to that?
Minna (as Myra): Certainly.
Rhi: He grins, and then leans forward.
Rhi (as Bazso): There’s an alchemist in The Red Sashes, name of Arun Vasar. They’re a child of some Iruvian nobles who’ve been living in Duskwall, and getting rid of them would be advantageous to me. What would be more advantageous would be if you could get me their notes, because Arun produces quite a lot of fun and interesting diversions for the nobility, expensive diversions. You bring me their notes, and I can have my people mix up something similar, and then we can start making that money.
Minna (as Myra): I understand. We’ll do our best.
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, this was less bracing than I was expecting. You have terrible taste in friends if you’re hanging around with… Minx.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, I know that I’m with quite a motley crew. Sometimes you just find friends and you stick with them.
Rhi (as Bazso): That’s not a lesson she has learned very well. Just keep that in mind.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure I can look after myself, Bazso.
Rhi (as Bazso): Hope that’s true.
Rhi: And then, he gestures at the door, like ‘eh, you can see yourself out.’
Minna (as Myra): Nice office. Thanks for the meeting.
Rhi (as Bazso): Bring me those notes.
Minna: She just nods to him and leaves.
## [0:28:00]
Rhi: Okay. So, the kind of bonus from Blaire getting a 6 on her information check and Myra, you getting a 6 on that information check, when you go through the guest list Arun was in attendance that night.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: And there’s actually a note next to their name indicating that they brought a bunch of, like there’s a list of designer drugs that they brought.
Josie: I suppose it’s important to figure out what the evidence we’ll need to plant on them is then.
Rhi: I mean, it could be that Winfield wasn’t paying up. You guys could go from that angle. Winfield had brought this person in to hand out fun drugs to his guests, and then you could present it as Winfield wasn’t willing to pay for the drugs, and so Arun killed him.
Minna: So, I think maybe if we plant some kind of notes on what’s owed.
Josie: So, that sounds like a pretty simple make, and then a breaking, entering, get it in there. Alright, so I think we have a mission type.
Rhi: Stealth.
Josie: Oh right, we don’t know where they’re at.
Rhi: I will say that because you got a 6 on your roll with Bazso that he provided information on where Arun operates out of. Lucky for you guys, my randomization roll worked out in your benefit. Arun has their own lab set up outside of The Red Sashes headquarters. They’re set up in one of the very few single family dwellings in Crow’s Foot. It’s close enough to The Red Sashes headquarters that they could probably summon guards from The Red Sashes if needed. So yeah, that is your target.
Josie: Do we need to gather some information on that?
Madge: Well, I did so well last time.
[laughter]
Josie: I have a dot of Survey.
Minna: I also have a dot of Survey.
Madge: Does everyone have Survey except for me?
Rhi: I think everyone should go, Phin is just… [laugh]
Madge: I’ll keep watch!
Josie: Yeah. Let’s fucking case this place.
Rhi: Yeah. So, go ahead and make your rolls, and tell me what you get.
Josie: I got a 2.
Minna: Oh, I got a 6.
Kim: I got a 5.
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Okay. Minx, you notice the house itself looks a little dilapidated and kind of run down, but it’s surrounded by a fence that is clearly very new and has a pretty sophisticated front gate. Blaire, you got a 5. You notice that there is a Sparkwright security system on the front gate.
Kim: Ooh, okay.
Rhi: Myra, you got a 6…
Minna: Are there buildings nearby from which we could reach the roof?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. So, because it is one of the few houses in the area, on either side actually there are apartment buildings.
Josie: Oh, cool.
Minna: Second story? [laughs] I feel like that’s our signature.
Rhi: You could deal with the fence situation by coming in via one of the apartment buildings on either side.
Josie: Yeah. I vote for that.
Kim: Yeah, that works.
Rhi: This engagement roll will be 2d6. It’s always so exciting, because one of my dice always just goes flying off behind my speaker. Okay! So, the one that didn’t run away was a 3, but the one that did go back to the corner of my desk was a 6.
Josie: Woo!
Minna: Nice.
Madge: Yay!
Rhi: So, good result, you’re in a controlled position when the action starts. We start off, you guys are clustered around a window on the third story of a tenement building. You’re looking down into Arun’s house, and you see there’s three people standing outside the front gate. You then see the gate open, the three people walk inside, a few minutes pass when you guys are kind of like, uh crap, and then four people come out. The three people who had gone in are now carrying large crates, and the fourth person who you recognize as Arun based on descriptions is leaving with a satchel slung over their shoulder.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Oh, so they’re not even going to be home for this? That’s awesome.
Rhi: At least not right now
Josie: Yeah. Let’s fucking go for it.
Rhi: So, you guys pop the window, climb down, hit the… well, it’s not really a yard, since there’s no sun, so there’s no grass, so it’s just kind of like big paving stones around the house. For the moment the house is empty. You’re not sure how long that will last. You can see from where you’re standing The Red Sashes headquarters, so it could be that maybe they’re just going over to supervise the delivery and will be coming right back. Maybe they’re going to be gone for six hours. You have no idea.
Josie: Alright, so moving quickly then. Let’s get in through… Should we just go in through a window?
Madge: Yeah!
Josie: Yeah. Let’s do it.
Rhi: So, the windows do have alarms on them. You can disable them from the outside unlike the ones at the Bluecoat station. This is a less sophisticated security system.
Kim: Oh cool.
Josie: Cool. Who’s got the Tinker about it?
Kim: Yeah. I have a rank in Tinker.
Rhi: It’s gonna be controlled for the position, and standard effect.
Kim: I got a 6.
Josie & Madge: Woo!
Rhi: Okay. You got a 6. Mark that you have your burglary tools as part of your load, and Blaire very easily disarms the security system. You guys lift up the window, and hop on in.
Josie: Yay.
Kim: Cool.
Rhi: The inside of this place is way nicer than the outside. There’s some nice rugs, some nice Iruvian art on the walls. The interior is painted nicely, kept very clean.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, so much good haul… But, shall we look for a basement? That’s where people do drug things, right? Basements?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi: You guys start looking around but you don’t see a basement door anywhere. Like, you open all the doors you can find and it’s like a study, a kitchen, a pantry.
Josie: And we’re not finding any evidence of illicit activity?
Rhi: The majority of the books are about alchemy, or Iruvia, but otherwise yeah, you’re not seeing anything.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, dear, do you want any of these books?
Kim (as Blaire): I would love those books.
Kim: How many of them can I take with me?
Rhi: I’m gonna say three books is equivalent to one point of load. You already used one point of your load for your burglary gear, so the most you could take is six if you want to just burn everything else.
Kim: That does not sound wise. I’ll just take the three books. You said that would count as one?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Madge: Can I start looking through the study?
Rhi: Sure.
Madge: And if I’m being physical about it, like I’m testing different books to see if it opens up a secret door or something, could I use Prowl for that?
Rhi: [hesitantly] Yeah…
Madge: Hee hee.
Rhi: But it’s going to take a lot longer and won’t be as effective, so I’m gonna say that it’s gonna be risky, lesser effect.
Madge: That was a 5.
Rhi: You do it. You are able to find an entrance. It is in fact hidden behind the bookshelf.
Madge: Ahaha!
Rhi: But it is the last book you check. You start at the bottom shelf and pull every book, and it is the top shelf, opposite side. It takes a really long time. So, this is going to be a complication, which is me starting a clock, Arun Coming Back, 1 out of 4, because you guys are in here for a while.
Madge: Okay.
Josie: During that long time, can I help myself to whatever’s in the parlor?
Rhi: Yeah. I think to determine how much you get roll either Study or Survey. This won’t be a roll where there’s gonna be negative consequences. It’s almost a gather information roll.
Josie: Yeah. I got a 4.
Rhi: You manage to snag about 2 coin worth of stuff.
Josie: Whoa.
Rhi: What kind of stuff do you grab? What does Minx go for?
Josie: Any sort of small rug or tapestry type deal.
Rhi: There’s definitely a small tapestry you can take.
Josie: Excellent. Basically, I’m willing to fill up load slots about it, but I’m not gonna be rolling up a rug or carrying any furniture out.
Rhi: I’m gonna say it’s also going to be about one load worth of stuff.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: What I’m picturing is that you use the tapestry as like a make-shift satchel that you just load a bunch of shiny stuff into ,and then like wrap it up.
Josie: [giggles] Yeah, shinies. So like, Minx comes back to Blaire completely draped in weird and colorful fabrics.
Kim (as Blaire): What… the fuck.
Josie (as Minx): What? I’m just making sure we get a good haul.
Madge (as Phin): [exasperated shout] I have never touched so many books in my life.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent work, Phin.
Rhi: Myra, what were you up to this whole time?
Minna: I think everyone else was kind of roaming the house. I was, uh, waiting in the front in case Arun came back.
Rhi: Okay. Phin, I think just as Blaire and Minx are talking you take the last book. If it’s not this book it’s gotta be somewhere else in this God forsaken study. You pull that, and there’s a ‘ka-chunk,’ and then the bookcase swings inward revealing a dark and narrow stairway.
Madge: I groan, and I knock some of the books off of the shelf that didn’t work.
Madge (as Phin): Useless things! [exasperated noises] … Ugh. I found it.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent.
Kim: Blaire picks up some of the books and puts them back on the shelf.
[giggling]
Madge (as Phin): Blaire, just let me have my victory, please. I need, I need, I need to win.
Kim (as Blaire): Just, just be nice to the books.
Madge (as Phin): No… They’re the reason why it took so long.
Rhi: So, you guys head down the stairs, and there is a door at the bottom. This door is solid metal, and has a fairly impressive lock.
Josie: Hmm. Well, I imagine we can have lock picking tools somewhere in here.
Kim: I have burglary tools on me.
Rhi: But this is a much tougher looking lock than the ones you were dealing with before.
Kim: But like, impossibly difficult?
Rhi: No, not impossibly so.
Kim: Alright, then I can give it a shot. And you know what, I can push myself.
Rhi: Just for context, this roll as is will be risky, lesser effect. If you don’t push yourself up to having standard effect it’s probably going to take you multiple rolls to get the door open.
Josie: If someone assists can that get it up to standard effect, or does it just boost dice?
Kim: Also, when you get a chance, I wanna know what a Devil’s Bargain looks like on this.
Rhi: So, one of you could assist and give her an extra die, and then Blaire could push herself or take a Devil’s Bargain to get increased effect, or another die depending on how you wanted to approach it. A Devil’s Bargain… Oh, I wanna do something with those books.
Kim: Are they cursed? [laughs]
Rhi: One of the books contains information that you shouldn’t have.
Kim: [gasps] Ooh. I like.
Rhi: Which it sounds intriguing to Blaire—
Kim: Yes!
Rhi: –but it’s the kind of thing that’s gonna blow up in your face, probably.
Kim: I want the Devil’s Bargain! [laughter] Because I live for self-sabotage.
Rhi: Okay. Is somebody going to take a point of stress to assist and give her a third?
Josie: I have some stress to spare, so I will.
Kim: Oh, thank you, Minx.
Rhi: So, you have 3d6, risky position, lesser effect. Go for it.
Kim: Oh boy. So, I got a 5, a 4, and a 2.
Rhi: It takes a long time for you to make any kind of progress, and we’re gonna tick that clock up to 2 out of 4, and because this is at lesser effect the lock is still not open. You’re pretty sure you can get it open, but it’s time consuming.
Kim: Mm.
Madge: [sweetly] Can I wreck it? Would people be okay with me wrecking it?
Minna: If we can get it open without wrecking it that would be good, because we don’t want them to know anything’s changed.
Madge: Yeah, that’s true.
Rhi: You know, aside from the missing tapestry and the books and all the other random stuff that Minx helped herself to.
Minna: Oh, that’s true.
Josie: Real quick idea here. Does the front door open in or out?
Rhi: In.
Josie: So, I could theoretically just go back out and throw a bunch of shit in front of it? Because I see the lock’s taking a while, and I’m like, every second is gonna count here.
Rhi: Yes. If you want to run upstairs and put something in front of the door—What are you thinking?
Josie: Like, furniture.
Rhi: Okay. I think you can do that. I don’t think that’s something that’s gonna really take a roll. Blaire, do you want to make another roll on picking the lock?
Kim: I think so. I think I should just try, at the risk of time running out, but still.
Rhi: You are at 2 out of 4 on the clock for Arun Coming Back.
Kim: Yeah. Can I push myself for an extra die?
Rhi: You sure can.
Kim: Okay. I’m gonna mark that stress off.
Minna: I can aide.
Kim: Thank you.
Rhi: So, you’ve got 3d6 again.
Kim: Alright. Let’s give this a shot. Oh boy, the highest one I got this time was also a 5.
Rhi: Okay, so I’m gonna give you a choice here.
Kim: Oh, boy, okay.
Rhi: You can either have it take a long time and I tick another mark on that clock, or there is a trap on the door that’s gonna zap you for level 1 harm.
Kim: Yeah, I’ll take the zap.
Rhi: What happens is you’re working at the door, you know it’s been taking a long time, so you just start going fast. You’re not being cautious, and there’s a metal plate above the lock that you hit something in the lock that clicks, but it’s not the click of the lock coming undone, and the plate slides out an inch, and then an arc of electroplasmic energy just zaps your arm.
Kim: Egh!
Rhi: And you do have the option to resist if you would like.
Kim: I’ll just fucking take it. We die like men.
Minna: Looks at party of entirely women.
Rhi: We die like men, pointlessly taking damage to prove a point.
[explosive laughter]
Kim: Yeah!
Rhi: But, the door is open.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re welcome.
Rhi: You say as you’re shaking out your hand. The room is dark, but you’re able to quickly find a light switch. It is basically the laboratory you were looking for. There are a lot of complicated alchemical devices set up, a lot of glass tubes and beakers, and… I don’t know. What’s the Industrial Revolution equivalent of a Bunsen burner?
Minna: Probably like a Bunsen burner. [laughs]
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Is that—Is that it? Are they that old? I don’t know.
Minna: Yeah, in 1852, apparently it was invented.
Rhi: Oh! Then, the room contains, among other things, Bunsen burners.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Now we know! This is an education podcast.
[humming tunes]
Rhi: There are a lot of boxes and jars full of different powders and liquids, and what look like crushed up organic matter like wood or leaves, stuff like that. Blaire, this is a fairly familiar setup to you. It looks not that much unlike your parents’ lab at home.
Kim: Oh, cool.
Rhi: It’s a fairly well organized workshop. There are papers, but they’re like stacked neatly in different places.
Madge: Man, I didn’t even think we would get this far.
Josie: Yeah, I think I’m still out there. I wanna shove more shit in front of the door, and then essentially keep watch.
Rhi: Okay. Minx is hanging out upstairs barricading the front door. What are the rest of you doing?
Minna: I feel like we need to look for papers.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Myra, you kind of just grab the first ones that come to hand and start flipping through them, and you realize that you’re not sure what this is, because it is not in a language you read, at least I’m assuming you don’t read Iruvian.
Minna: I feel like I probably don’t read Iruvian. I’m probably lucky that I read—Is it Akorosian?
Rhi: Imperial, I think is what it would be.
Minna: Imperial, that’s it.
Rhi: So yeah, the papers that you see here are in a language you don’t speak.
Josie: Huh, that’s a problem with inserting something into the notes, isn’t it?
Minna: Well, numbers, numbers and names, unless it’s a different alphabet.
Rhi: Yeah, if you wanna look more detailed, you can make a roll.
Minna: What would I roll for that? Study?
Rhi: Yeah, Study will be the better option.
Minna: I would like to either lead a group action or push myself.
Rhi: Leading a group action would probably make sense if all three of you just kind of fan out to search the room.
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: So, I don’t mind leading.
Madge: I got 6 on both of my dice!
Kim: What?!
Madge: Hahaha!
Rhi: Okay. Myra, what did you get?
Minna: Two.
Rhi: Two, okay, so you’re gonna take a point of stress. Myra, you tell Blaire and Phin what to look for and you all fan out. So, tell me how Phin finds it and how the other two missed it.
Madge: Can Phin have found it because she tripped and fell, and it was hiding under one of the work desks?
Rhi: Yes. Absolutely. I like that very much. So, Blaire and Myra are very carefully going through the stacks of paper. Phin is just kind of like poking at stuff, moving some bottles around…
Madge: Oh. Did the bottles like fall over, and I’m like—
Rhi: Yes! [laughter] Yeah, a bottle falls, it doesn’t break, but you lunge to grab it and trip over your own feet and just face plant. Then, as you raise your head, you see wedged behind the workbench is a black, leather-bound book. You just kinda go, huh okay, and reach back and grab it, and flip it open, and oh hey it’s a ledger.
Madge (as Phin): Um, I think I found it.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, for goodness—Good job.
Madge: [giggles]
Minna (as Myra): Alright. Let’s take a look at this thing.
Rhi: So, I will say the Iruvian alphabet is the same as the Imperial alphabet, because I think that kind of Imperial hegemony makes sense. The ledger is a list of names, words that you don’t recognize, based on the fact that there’s the same name with the same unfamiliar word repeated you’re guessing that these unfamiliar words are names of drugs.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Is his name anywhere?
Rhi: Winfield’s?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: You don’t see his name, but you do see the names of, towards the very end, the most recent entries, you see some names that you recognize from the guest ledger of his party, so you could, if you wanted to, try to add his name in there.
Minna: Yeah, I mean, I don’t see why not, and maybe for like large sums.
Rhi: Yeah. So, whoever is doing the forgery is gonna have to make some kind of a roll.
Kim: I don’t mind doing a Study roll since I have 2 in that.
Rhi: Risky position, and it’s gonna stay at lesser effect because you’re trying to write in a language you don’t speak.
Kim: Oh no, I got a 3. I’m sorry, friends.
Rhi: I think I’m gonna give you options again.
Kim: [weakly] Okay.
Rhi: Either I fill in the rest of that clock and Arun returns, or you just make some kind of mistake in writing it, you basically lose the opportunity, you can’t do the evidence planting in this way.
Kim: What do you guys think? I think I should just make the mistake instead of filling the clock.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Madge: Yeah.
Kim: Alright. I’ll do that.
Rhi: You realize as you’re writing that you’re not matching their handwriting.
Kim: Instead of stopping, can I just like keep going belligerently and just leave it obvious that it’s fake, and just give them the middle finger? Like fuck you.
Rhi: I mean, if you want.
Kim: Yeah. Blaire is just going to draw a big smiley face, because she’s had it.
Rhi: So, that avenue for planting evidence is closed to you.
Minna: So, something we could do is do a flashback and somehow we brought some other kind of evidence.
Rhi: Ooh, yeah, that would definitely work.
Minna: Nyryx might have some kind of tokens from him that we could plant.
Josie: I think I’ll take the stress from that flashback, then.
Rhi: I’m gonna say that’s gonna be one stress. It’s a little out of your way but it’s not unreasonable.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, I think one of the items that you guys should plant in here is a monogramed handkerchief [gasps] that belonged to Winfield that one of you doctored with a little blood.
Kim: Ooh. Nice. I like that.
Josie: Oh, yeah. Yeah, that’s awesome.
Minna: There could be like a bobble that he bought her that could be traced to him having bought it, maybe, like some kind of piece of jewelry.
Rhi: Yeah, but then I guess the question is why would Arun have it. Unless you’re trying to set up an idea that, you know, Winfield and Arun had a romantic relationship.
Minna: Yeah. That’s exactly what I’m doing, because that’s what we have access to.
Madge: It was a crime of passion!
Minna: Well, yeah! Hey, that’s a damn good motive.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay. I think it’s a lapel pin in the shape of a crescent moon that has a few little gemstones in it.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: Yeah. What’s something else?
Josie: Bear with me, this is super weird, but something bioluminescent. Right?
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: They like harvest the essence of it and put it in a little locket or something.
Rhi: Oh yeah, that’s cool. Minx, you previously were able to get those from Nyryx.
Minna: I assume we would’ve put them in their living areas.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: I mean, maybe we stash the handkerchief down here, maybe balled up in like the back of a drawer.
Madge: Yeah, so that it looks like it was hidden away on purpose.
Rhi: Okay. You hide the handkerchief. Blaire, as you were searching the room previously, since you did get a 5 on that, you noticed as you were looking at the other papers that were around, you can’t read Iruvian but you recognize some of the diagrams, and you’re pretty sure that a lot of these loose papers that are around are alchemical recipes.
Kim: Cool.
Rhi: You guys gonna grab those?
Minna: Yes, please.
Rhi: Anything else you wanna do while you’re down in this creepy workshop?
Minna: I’d say no. let’s just go ahead and head up.
Rhi: Where do you hide the jewelry?
Minna: I’d say hide the jewelry in their bedroom. If they have any kind of a vanity or other place they keep little trinkets.
Rhi: You’re able to do that. I guess the other question is do you guys clear out the stuff in front of the door?
Josie: Yeah, it sounds like we have some time, so let’s do it.
Rhi: A couple of you clear the door while the others are hiding the jewelry. How are you guys getting out of here? There’s not really another exit. There’s the front gate.
Minna: They’re gonna know at this point somebody robbed it, because Minx took all sorts of trinkets.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: So, it doesn’t much matter if we trip an alarm on the way out, because we’re leaving immediately.
Kim: That’s true. Yeah.
Madge: [sweetly] Can I wreck it?
Rhi: You… You know what, you sure can.
[laughter]
Minna: Bless.
Rhi: I know. Phin hasn’t gotten to punch a single person this time. It’s so sad.
Madge: I got a 6.
Rhi: What tool do you pull out to just smash through?
Madge: Could it be like a giant billyclub type thing?
Rhi: Yeah. So you just smash your way through the gate, an alarm starts sounding, and you guys run off.
Minna: Yep.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: So, who are you going to tell about this in The Bluecoats?
Josie: What about the person we talked to earlier, Laroze or whatever?
Rhi: Yeah. Does somebody wanna do that flashback? I think it’s gonna be a point of stress.
Madge: I’m at 0 stress, so I would be fine with doing that.
Minna: Oh yeah, go ahead.
Rhi: You told Laroze this person needs to be investigated for the Winfield murder.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: As the alarm is blaring, you guys hustle off into the night with your stolen goods. I’m gonna do a fortune roll on the inspectors to see if they bite on this. Yep! I rolled a 6, so the inspectors are gonna start. They’re gonna turn their attention in this direction now.
Josie: Woo!
Madge: We did it.
Josie: We did the thing.
## [53:39]
Rhi: Before we go into downtime, let’s do giving these notes to Bazso. So, Myra, are you gonna be the one making that delivery?
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, you head over there. Bazso, when you met him the first time, was wearing a nice suit, looked very put together. This time when you go in it’s later at night, still wearing most of a suit, but it’s kind of like the tie has been loosened, sleeves are rolled up, has a glass of whiskey in his hand, and he’s sitting behind the desk looking a little bit more relaxed. He just kind of looks at you and is like:
Rhi (as Bazso): I’ll be damned. Did you actually pull it off?
Minna (as Myra): Well, we certainly got into the house and we managed to plant some clues, so we’ll see how that plays out.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah?
Minna (as Myra): My colleague tells me that these look like they might be some alchemist notes. We’re not quite sure how to read them, because none of us read Iruvian.
Rhi: He takes them and sort of flips through.
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, I don’t fucking read Iruvian.
Rhi: He throws them down on the desk.
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, we’re gonna have a hell of a time finding somebody to translate this, but that is not your fault. I hope this works out well for you. Thank you for bringing me these notes, even though I don’t know if they will be of use to me. [sighs]
Rhi: He’s annoyed, but it’s clearly not directed at you. If anything it seems more like he’s almost annoyed at himself for like, why did I not think that the Iruvians would write their notes in Iruvian.
Minna (as Myra): You know, it didn’t occur to us either that we would have trouble with the language difference.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah, well, live and learn. Right? At least the Sashes don’t have them anymore. You want a drink?
Minna (as Myra): Sure. Why not?
Rhi: I’m gonna say that this is gonna push you guys back to a -1 with the Lampblacks.
Josie: Yay.
## Downtime [55:28]
Rhi: Let’s move into downtime. You guys are gonna get 3 rep. I think the only coin you’re gonna make from this is the 2 coin that Minx lifted, because you didn’t ask Bazso to pay you.
Minna: We got paid in that change in our relationship.
Josie: And I got paid in 2 coin.
Rhi: [whispered] I think you guys might not have gotten any heat on this one.
Madge: Yes!
Minna: If this works out long term, will this help with our heat situation?
Rhi: It will clear one of your wanted levels.
Minna: Cool.
Rhi: I think it’s gonna be a little bit, just because there is going to be an investigation and then a trial to see whether or not this pays off.
Minna: Oh, totally.
Kim: I want to do the long term project.
Rhi: Let’s do that. How do you get her attention?
Kim: I imagine it’s some kind of spooky ritual.
Rhi: Probably.
Kim: It’s probably some kind of pentacle or some kind of symbol on the ground, and I imagine that little vial of sea water is in the center.
Rhi: The vial of sea water shatters.
Kim: [gasps] Oh shit.
Rhi: Setarra sort of surges up from it. You’ve only ever seen her in her human form. She has a human guise that she wears, and she looks Tycherosi.
Kim: Ohh.
Rhi: She has some kind of demonic trait the way that you do, so what does she look like?
Kim: I like to imagine that she’s very tall, and she has very long, sleek, black hair. It looks like it’s slicked back, like it’s wet. Her clothes are very drapey and have these dark, cool colors, and I think her demonic trait is like she just has these jet black eyes.
Rhi: Cool. Very cool. She looks around, and then looks at you.
Rhi (as Setarra): Ah, Blaire. It has been some time.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s been a while, yeah. How—
Rhi (as Setarra): What did you need me for?
Kim: She reaches into one of her pockets and has one of the acorns in her hands.
Kim (as Blaire): I was wondering if you knew anything about what this might be.
Rhi: She reaches out and takes it from you, and brings it up to her eyes, and studies it.
Rhi (as Setarra): I am not certain on first look. I may be able to find out. May I keep this?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. You can keep that one.
Rhi: She just sort of folds her fingers around it, and it’s gone.
Rhi (as Setarra): I will see what I can learn and tell you more. It is something of the earth, not of the sea.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi (as Setarra): I will have to speak to my kin.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s helpful. Thank you.
Rhi: She sort of looks down at the symbol, and looks back, and says:
Rhi (as Setarra): Next time you call, provide a larger amount of sea water. This was… difficult.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Yes, I’ll do that.
Rhi: She just kind of looks down at her feet for a second, and then looks back up at you, and is like:
Rhi (as Setarra): I will contact you when I know more.
Rhi: And then just like walks off. It’s a little awkward. [laughs]
Kim: Okay!
Rhi: Alright. How do you get cut off at the tailor’s?
Josie: I’m thinking just… Minx is kind of riding high and keeps asking for more ridiculous and intricate garments and jobs from the tailors at Dundridge & Sons, and it just eventually becomes A, way above her paygrade, and B, way too intricate and precise, and her being over their shoulder like, no no no, the pattern needs to be like this.
Rhi: You’re leaning over somebody’s shoulder, no no no, it should be like this, and the tailor just like puts his hand up and almost hits you in the face. Just like:
Rhi (as Tailor): No. No, we are done. This—I am not even—I don’t know why I am wasting my time with this sketch. You can’t afford it anyway. You are done.
Josie (as Minx): But, come now, surely we can—
Rhi (as Tailor): Eh! Yip! [interrupting utterances] Get! Get out!
Josie (as Minx): Fine dear.
Josie: [laughs] And she leaves dejected. Remember how we described that being in The Nest with Minx after a breakup is the absolute worst because it’s just kind of a mess of complaining, empty wine bottles, and running mascara? Yeah, I think this is kind of like that in The Nest for the day.
Rhi: Blaire comes back from her unsettling chat with Setarra and finds Minx.
Josie: Just sort of face-down at a table sobbing with a wine bottle there.
Kim: Blaire doesn’t even say anything. She just rolls her eyes and walks over to her room.
[giggling]
Kim: She’s just like:
Kim (as Blaire): Must be Tuesday.
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Don’t mock my pain!
Rhi: Myra.
Minna: Yes?
Rhi: You are off chatting with your buddy Laroze, and I think you find him again at The Leaky Bucket. He’s sitting in his usual seat, and seems to be in a pretty good mood. He’s chatting with one of the bartenders, and is laughing, and gesturing wildly with his mug. When he sees you he’s like:
Rhi (as Laroze): Oh! Hey! It’s teacher lady!
Minna: So uh, she walks over to him and sits down.
Rhi (as Laroze): Hey, hey, tell your buddy, the little horn girl, that all those, and the other one, the especially, tell the punchy one, we have that tip about the raid on… what’s their face, uh, Vasha? Vasar? Whatever.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Rhi (as Laroze): I am the one that found the stuff that belonged to Winfield, and the inspectors were all over it. [whispered] I am in line for a promotion!
Minna (as Myra): Congratulations. Perhaps I could buy you a drink in celebration.
Rhi (as Laroze): Yes. Yeah, I am…
Rhi: And he looks at his glass, it’s like half full, and he holds up a finger, chugs it back, puts it down, and goes:
Rhi (as Laroze): Yeah, I definitely need another one. This one’s all, all gone.
Minna: She turns to the bar.
Rhi: Yeah, and the bartender’s just like, ‘nnn…’ and gets another drink, kinda gives you a look like ‘do you want one?’
Minna (as Myra): A tea, if you have it.
Rhi: Raises an eyebrow, and is like:
Rhi (as Bartender): I can get you water.
Minna (as Myra): That would be fine as well.
Rhi: Alright, so he brings you a water and another beer for Laroze. Laroze is like:
Rhi (as Laroze): Listen, listen. I… I owe you guys. They’re talking about making me a sergeant. I’m gonna be able to boss people around. And, I am gonna, I told one of the other ones, I think the horn girl, that there are a lot of people that wanna arrest you guys. I’m gonna try to use my new powers in my new position, I’ma make that go away for you, because you help me, and so I help you. That’s how this works. We help each other out.
Rhi: And he like slings an arm around your shoulders.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. That sounds about right. Thank you.
Rhi: So, that is how you have reduced heat. What does Phin get up to?
Madge: I feel like at this point we’ve seen a lot of Phin just punching things, so we’ll do the Insight training montage.
Rhi: Okay. Cool.
Madge: She either goes to Chael or she goes to one of the other people that she knows, and she sort of tags along with them for the day and picks up what she can from them.
Rhi: I like the idea of you hanging out with Chael.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: So, Chael is the one described as vicious thug, right?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think the scene opens with the two of you sitting in a dive bar in The Docks.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You wanna describe Chael, what they look like?
Madge: I kinda like the idea that Phin and Chael look similar. It’s not like they could be siblings or anything, but it looks like Chael could be Phin’s cousin or something like that, like the resemblance is there. They have a really similar face shape and they both have black hair, except Chael wears theirs back in a really tight pony tail rather than keeping it cut short like Phin does.
Rhi: The two of you are sitting at a table in this dive bar, and Chael is like leaned over to you and is like:
Rhi (as Chael): So, what you wanna watch for if they actually are guilty is they’re gonna do things like avoid eye contact, fidget, they’re gonna have a hard time keeping their story straight. You wanna ask questions like, if they tell you something, come back to it a couple minutes later and see if it’s the same thing. Usually if somebody’s lying and they’re not good at it, they’re gonna give a different answer, it won’t match up. So, anyway, that guy over there is a lying sack of shit who stole about 4 coin worth of property from my boss, so we’re gonna go over there and beat the shit out of him.
Madge (as Phin): Yes!
Rhi (as Chael): But that is, I just want to explain, because you were asking, this is how I know when someone is lying, and then you get to beat them up.
Madge (as Phin): Okay.
Rhi: Phin’s just like ‘yeah, okay,’ and then they both stand up, and there’s just like off screen punching sounds and [yelling].
Madge: [laughs] Yes.
Rhi: So, I think where we’re gonna leave off is the four of you, a couple days later, Minx has pulled herself out of her grief and everybody else has come back together at the Hound’s Paw. You guys are hanging out at your normal table, chatting, and Rigney comes over with your drinks, hands out your drinks, and puts an envelope in the middle of the table and says:
Rhi (as Rigney): A message came in for you all from that reporter lady. I figured you’d all be interested.
Rhi: So, he leaves that there.
Josie: Ooh, what does it say?
Rhi: So you open it up and it is from Lani, and it just says “I’ve learned more about The Umbra Hunters. Come by my office as soon as you can.”

## intro music
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us and for sharing what you think about the show. We’ve gotten a lot of new listeners recently thanks to people telling their friends and their Twitter followers about us. So if you like the show, keep telling people about it, subscribe, and leave reviews. All these things help more people find us. Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
## [00:00:32] featured charity
Kim: Last year, the music world lost one of its most influential voices in Chester Bennington, lead singer of Linkin Park, who died by suicide in July. Since his passing, there has been an outpouring of love and support from within the community, but also a desire for change.
320 Changes Direction, which is spearheaded by Chester’s wife, Talinda, aims to offer resources and support to those suffering from depression and addiction, and to change the way that we think and talk about mental health.
To learn about the five signs of emotional distress, make a donation, or take the pledge to be a part of the culture for change, visit www.changedirection.org. Together, we can end the stigma that surrounds suicide and depression, and make Chester proud.
Rhi: If you have a few dollars to spare, consider donating today.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## [00:01:25] story resumes
Rhi: You head over to the offices of The North Hook Mirror, over at the docks. When you get inside, one of the pages who’s working there recognizes you and walks you back to the office that Lani and Roxanne share.
It is, as mentioned previously, a mess of paper. Lani is at her desk shuffling through some of those papers. Roxanne looks up and waves at you, and taps Lani on the shoulder when you all squeeze into the office. Lani brightens and gestures for one of you to close the door. She starts explaining what she’s found out. She basically launches right into what she’s learned about The Umbra Hunters.
Rhi (as Lani): The information on The Umbra Hunters was somewhat difficult to find. They were broken up about seven years ago when their leadership was arrested. But it turns out, it looks like it was all the leadership except one. There was an informant among the gang’s leaders who sold out everyone else. They all went to Ironhook, and as best I can tell, the rest of the leadership has since been killed in prison. Unfortunately, I don’t know this person’s name, because in all of the records I could get access to, the name was either redacted with ink, or, in some cases—
Rhi: She pauses in signing to hold up a piece of paper that literally has cut out with a scalpel little sections of paper where a name would have been. She lowers that and raises her eyebrows, and then continues.
Rhi (as Lani): I think that The Bluecoats have his name in some records somewhere. They wouldn’t completely strike this information from their records, because they would want to keep leverage on a person like this. I don’t know exactly where that would be; maybe in the archives somewhere.
I also learned that a lot of the gang members who used to be part of The Umbra Hunters are now providing security at The Centuralia Club.
Rhi: The Centuralia Club is a very high-end social club. It has the finest in drinks, food, drugs, companionship – any pleasure that you could want, you could get here for the right price. The entry fee to gain membership into the club is four coin per person.
Kim: Oof.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: It is extremely expensive and extremely exclusive.
Madge: That’s fine. [laughter]
Rhi: Other former members of The Umbra Hunters have been seen continuing their attacks on The Gondoliers. No one else has been killed at this point, but they’re still being attacked pretty frequently.
Lani, as she finishes her explanation, rummages around in her papers some more and comes up with a couple sheets of paper that she hands over to you guys. It is a list of names.
Rhi (as Lani): These are about 12 members of The Umbra Hunters that I was able to confirm their former membership.
Rhi: You recognize a couple of the names from the report that you originally stole from the Nightmarket station, but a lot of the other ones don’t look familiar to most of you. Phin, there is one that stands out to you: Elizo Fortunado. You know this guy. He’s a street brawler and pit fighter; you’ve seen him in some of the pits before. I don’t know if you would have fought him, because he is about seven feet tall; basically, a mountain of meat.
Madge: Yeah. [laugh] Phin’s tough, but not that tough. It would be like she goes in the ring and gets her head squished.
Rhi: Yeah. He also is a guy where there have been a couple, quote unquote, “accidental” deaths in the ring against him.
Kim: Oh my god.
Rhi: Lani hands that list over.
Rhi (as Lani): This is all the information that I was able to find. If you can keep digging, see if you can find out what their connection to The Circle of Flame is, any information that you can bring us would be greatly appreciated.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll dig away.
Rhi: Roxanne finishes translating and nods. Then she adds:
Rhi (as Roxanne): We, again, can’t really offer a lot in the way of reward, but depending on what you’re able to bring us, we’ll try to scrape together some money to pay you. But otherwise, well, you all seem, uh, pretty industrious. I’m sure you can help yourself to things if you need it.
Josie (as Minx): Especially since we might be going into the fucking Centuralia Club! Sorry, pardon my language.
Madge (as Phin): You are really excited about this, aren’t you?
Josie: By the way, Minx, pretty much from the word “Centuralia Club” has just had her hands to her cheeks and just sort of zoned out, happy face.
[laughter]
Rhi: Has not heard a word that’s been said since.
Minna: [laughter]
Josie: Oh, yeah, totally.
Josie, Rhi, and Kim: [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, it’s The Centuralia Club. Surely you’ve heard of it, yes?
Madge (as Phin): Uh… Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… Sure.
Madge (as Phin): It’s rich person central.
Josie (as Minx): It’s not just rich person central! You can get whatever you want there. Just going there proves that you’ve made it. You never have to worry about anything again if you can get in there!
Minna (as Myra): I believe that what Minx is saying is that it’s the dream.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Yes, exactly.
Madge (as Phin): Her dream, maybe.
Josie (as Minx): Precisely. I’ve been dreaming of that place since… Well, since I was a little girl.
Madge: Phin pats her on the shoulder.
Madge (as Phin): I hate to burst your bubble, but it’s a month’s wages for us to even get in the door?
Kim (as Blaire): When have we ever paid for anything?
Madge (as Phin): Blaire does have a point. We haven’t paid for much, so…
Rhi: Roxanne has been translating all of this, and Lani is just sitting there, observing you all. She just shakes her head and is like:
Rhi (as Lani): If you all manage to get inside there, you’ve obviously earned it, because that place is… From what I’ve heard, they seem to specifically try to keep out—
Madge (as Phin): People like us?
Minna (as Myra): Riffraff.
Josie (as Minx): People like you, thank you very much.
Kim (as Blaire): Street rats.
Minna (as Myra): We’re aware of where we came from.
Madge (as Phin): I like being from the piers.
Rhi: Lani shrugs and is like:
Rhi (as Lani): It’s not exactly a place that I have ever wanted to visit. But Minx, I hope you’re able to achieve your dream.
Josie (as Minx): Why, thank you. And it’s less of a hope and more of a certainty. I mean, have you seen me?
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t encourage her.
Rhi: [laughing] Roxanne translates that. They’re both just like… They’re trying very hard to be polite and not start snickering at you. They’re mostly holding it together. Anyway, Roxanne takes a second to compose herself.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Is there any other information we can give you, any other questions you might have?
Madge (as Phin): Nope. I got mine out of the way.
Minna (as Myra): Sounds good.
Josie: Minx is itching to get going.
Rhi: Lani signs her goodbyes and Roxanne walks you guys back out, and says:
Rhi (as Roxanne): I know that last time we asked you to look into things for us went kind of badly for you. So please, don’t take any unnecessary risks. If you’re able to get any of this information, that would be great, but don’t get yourselves hurt.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, keyword “unnecessary.” We may still take risks, but… You know.
Madge (as Phin): We’re us.
Josie (as Minx): We’re flattered by your concern, but we’ve handled pretty tough situations by now, I think.
Minna (as Myra): It won’t be on your conscience. It’ll be something we’ve chosen to do.
Rhi (as Roxanne): All right. Well, I appreciate that. Just, good luck out there.
Rhi: She heads back inside.
## [00:09:20] scene change
Rhi: So, who wants to go check into what? I mean, I know exactly where Minx is going to launch as though from a catapult.
[laughter]
Josie: Of course.
Rhi: But what do the rest of you wanna do?
Minna: I believe it’s worth the sniff around the archives.
Rhi: Yeah. So you wanna go chat with Jeren?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Phin, Blaire? What are you guys thinking?
Madge: I just wanna wait outside the club and see if I can get a sense of when certain security guards leave. And follow one of them. [nervous laugh]
Rhi: Okay. Yep, you can definitely do that. Blaire, what are you thinking?
Kim: I’m thinking I’m going to try and go back to the piers and speak with my new contact, and talk to them again about the attacks that’re happening.
Rhi: Okay, so talking to The Gondoliers again?
Kim: Mhmm.
Rhi: Yeah. I imagine that, Minx and Phin, you two probably head over to the club together and split off to do your separate things. How do you wanna go about stalking someone?
Madge: I guess it would probably be Prowl, right?
Rhi: Yeah, if you wanna sneak along behind somebody.
Madge: Yes. Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Cool! [laugh] I got a 6! [laughter]
Rhi: Oh, hey! Awesome. Good start.
The Centuralia Club is located in a large, basically refurbished mansion. It’s across the street from a small park that overlooks The River Dosk. You post up in the park and keep an eye out. After a little while you see two women leave the mansion. They’re clearly not guests. They are wearing pretty nice uniforms; they’re black with brass buttons and some brass-colored trim. The two women leave together and start walking off down the street. They’re chatting to each other and you are able to follow.
Madge: Is one of them closer to my size than the other?
Rhi: Yes. Based on looks, they’re Skovlanders. You also are pretty sure that they’re probably related. They look pretty similar. One of them, her hair is really short. The other one has it braided and pinned up in a bun. The one whose hair is really short is closer to your build. You notice, as you fall in behind her, she has what initially looks like a coiled whip. Then you hear a faint metallic clank and you realize it is a coiled up chain.
Madge: [gasps]
Rhi: You’ve seen some people who use these kind of weapons. It’s basically a big, spiked chain. The other woman is a little more slight. She has a pair of pistols on her hips. They do not take any notice of you. You’re able to follow them back to one of those mansions that has been chopped up into little apartments. It’s a three story mansion. Basically, you see them go inside, you wait for a little bit, and then follow them in. By standing at the bottom of the stairs you can see which second floor unit they go into, so you know exactly where these two live.
Madge: Nice.
## [00:12:31] Minx
Rhi: How about we jump over to Minx, the other have of the Centuralia stakeout?
Josie: Minx is actually gonna do less of a stakeout. She’s gonna dress up as fine as she can. What she’s gonna do, I think, is try to impersonate a noble inquiring as to club policies.
Rhi: Okay, so just try to talk to somebody at the door, not necessarily try to get in?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. What kind of roll do you wanna make for that?
Josie: I wanna make Sway. I want to establish a noble personality for myself and let it be known that I will be attending soon and I wanna know exact policies.
Rhi: Okay, cool. Go ahead and make your roll.
Josie: [gasp] Oh, no, wait. There was a 4 there. There’s a four there.
Rhi: [laughing] Out of curiosity, what are the other two numbers?
Josie: A 1 and a 2.
Rhi: With a 4, you get a standard amount of information. Describe your approach to the place of your dreams.
Josie: Well, first of all, a ways down the block, she stops and stares dreamily at it for a moment. What is the front of the club looking like?
Rhi: It’s surrounded by a very high wrought iron fence. Unlike Arun’s house, which was a house surrounded by a fence that had two tall buildings on either side, this doesn’t really have anything on either side of it where you could easily get over the fence. The gate is currently open, but there are two guards on either side of the gate. Then, at the front doors, which are these big, ornate double doors, there’s two electroplasmic lamps in crystal sconces on either side of the front door clearly illuminating the other two guards who are standing outside.
You see, as you’re standing there staring dreamily, another handful of nobles who walk up to the door. They seem to have some kind of interaction with the guards. You can’t quite tell if they’re saying something or showing some kind of item. There’s clearly some kind of sign of membership that you have to give in order to gain access. They do that and the guards open up the doors.
For the briefest of moments, you catch a glimpse of light, and a golden chandelier, and tapestries, and then the door closes again.
Josie (as Minx): [whimper]
Josie: I will simply approach, as others do, and wait my turn. But when I approach the guards, I’m just gonna introduce myself as Lady Titanbrooke and ask:
Josie (as Minx): Just as to matters of policy, ‘cause I shall be attending not on the morrow but within the week, as the fancy strikes.
Rhi: The one guard who you’re talking to, who is a Akarosian man, his hair slicked back, he’s got a sword at his side; same uniform that all the other guards have had. He looks you up and down and nods and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): What policies are you interested in learning about? It’s four coin for entrance.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, yes. I’m aware of that. I’m more inquiring… Well, the specific question I have is, suppose I have trusted help; a family butler, as it were. I imagine he is subject also to the entrance fee, yes?
Rhi (as Guard): Yes. Anyone who wishes to enter, the fee is required.
Josie (as Minx): All right.
Rhi (as Guard): Though I’m not entirely sure why you would need to bring your staff along with you. We have people here who can take care of everything you would need.
Josie (as Minx): It is more a matter of familiarity and it is a bit of a tradition in my family to be attended. Suppose if I were to pay his entry fee, what would they be allowed to do? It is partly a safety thing on my end.
Rhi (as Guard): I mean, anyone who has paid the entrance fee and gained membership is free to take part of whatever they wish within the first and second levels of the club. The premier club levels on the third floor requires an additional fee.
Josie (as Minx): I see. And I imagine your security extends slightly beyond the club walls, yes?
Rhi (as Guard): No. You are responsible for getting yourself here and to wherever you go under your own accord. However, once you pass through the gate and have paid the membership fee, you are under our dedicated protection. Your physical safety and personal privacy will be absolutely protected.
Josie (as Minx): Obviously, there is trained personnel to that effect. But is there some means of storing items?
Rhi (as Guard): Yes, we do have options for securing valuables that you do not wish to have loose while you are potentially incapacitated or intoxicated or otherwise distracted.
Josie (as Minx): All right, thank you. Thank you for your information. I shall be attending… Hmm. I imagine Friday night would be the best day, yes.
Rhi (as Guard): All right. Well, then, we’ll look forward to seeing you.
Josie (as Minx): Mhm.
## [00:17:34] investigation: Blaire
Rhi: Blaire?
Kim: Yes. Blaire is going to make her way back to the piers, and, if not find any gondolier, she’s specifically looking for the one that she ran into like a couple weeks ago at this point.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: In that case, yeah, she’s specifically looking for the giant woman.
Rhi: So, what are you gonna roll to chat with her?
Kim: Probably consort, I would imagine.
Rhi: Yeah, since you’re just having a friendly chat.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah, so go ahead and make that roll.
Kim: Okay. 4.
Rhi: 4. Okay. You’re able to find her down in one of the underground canals. She’s leaning against the wall, has one food against the wall, and she’s just absently staring off into the distance. She glances over as you approach and is like:
Rhi (as Large Gondolier): Where you headed to?
Kim (as Blaire): Nowhere yet. I was looking for you, actually.
Rhi (as Large Gondolier): Oh, okay.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know we’ve ever actually exchanged names. I’m Blaire.
Kim: And she holds out her hand to shake.
Rhi (as Large Gondolier): Kay.
Rhi: She shakes your hand, still seeming a little confused. At this point, Blaire is a unique enough looking individual, being Tycherosi, that she’s giving you that look of “I recognize you but I don’t know where I recognize you from. Probably a passenger at some point.”
Kim: Oh, no. Is it obvious? Do you think I pick up on it?
Rhi: I think so.
Kim: Right. So, after a second, she’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Oh. Me and my friend, we stopped by a couple weeks ago to ask you questions about the attacks on your people.
Rhi (as Kay): Right. Yes. Yes, I remember. Yeah, they’re still happening, if you were looking for an update.
Kim (as Blaire): A little bit of an update. I know that they’re still happening, and I’m sorry about that, by the way. But the other thing is, I’m trying to find some kind of connection between the gang that’s attacking you and what their connection may be to this cult, I guess you could say, called The Circle of Flame. Have you noticed anything especially weird about the attacks? Anything creepy, occult-y?
Rhi (as Kay): They definitely have an interest in that sort of thing. They seem to think that we have some sort of secret knowledge about lost artifacts of Duskwall. And we know a few things; the canals have a lot of secrets.
Kim (as Blaire): That makes you a target, yeah.
Rhi (as Kay): Yeah. From what I have heard – none of them have really come after me, mind you. But from what I’ve heard, they’re very interested in something or someone called “Kotar.” They seem to just be looking for any kind of information that they can get, and they’re willing to beat people bloody, and sometimes to death, if they don’t get it.
Kim (as Blaire): What makes you thinks these people are working for the cult, whereas they aren’t the cult themselves?
Rhi (as Kay): I don’t think they’re a cult. I mean, in my experience, they don’t quite work this way.
Kim (as Blaire): Fair.
Rhi (as Kay): The Circle of Flame…
Kim (as Blaire): You know about them?
Rhi (as Kay): We know they exist. We know that they have some kind of grand plans for the city that I don’t think will be beneficial to anyone but them. And they’re pretty interested in these occult artifacts. You know, we hear things from our passengers; we hear things from the spirits that haunt the canals. Don’t have a lot of details, but The Circle of Flame is using this old gang – what are they, The Umbra Hunters?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi (as Kay): Or they’re employing them, or whatever, to do their dirty work, as best we can tell.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t have any guesses as to how you could get to The Circle of Flame through these guys, do you? You don’t think they’d leave behind any clue, or you could trail any of them? Well, I’m asking hypothetical; I’m using the royal “you,” I’m not asking “you you” specifically. Um, I’m asking—
Rhi: She starts chuckling a little bit as you’re flailing.
Josie and Kim: [laughter]
Kim: Yeah.
Kim and Rhi: [laughter]
Minna: Aww.
Rhi: She just waves. She’s like:
Rhi (as Kay): It’s fine. I get it. I would say, find out who’s giving their orders. Find out who they’re working for, and, I think, that will lead you in the right direction.
Kim (as Blaire): Right.
Rhi (as Kay): But be careful if you plan on going after these people. They are very dedicated to getting what they want, and they’re not afraid to break people who get in their way.
Kim (as Blaire): [sigh] Well, lucky for them, I’m not a people.
Kim: She gestures to herself and her horns and stuff.
Josie and Madge: Aww.
Minna: [plaintive noise]
Josie: You’re a good people!
Kim: [laughter]
Rhi: She just gives you a sideways smile and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): You hold onto that, kid.
Kim (as Blaire): I intend to. I’ll let you get back to work now. Sorry to bother you.
Rhi (as Kay): It’s all right. It’s been pretty slow tonight here, anyway.
Rhi: You wrap things up with Kay.
## [00:22:03] investigation: Myra
Rhi: Myra, where do you go to meet Jeren when you cannot meet him at your office because you guys are incredible wanted and you can’t set foot in a Bluecoat station anymore?
Minna: I mean, I think I send a note to the effect that I wanna have that lunch that I’ve been promising him.
Rhi: Okay. So, where do you guys meet?
Minna: We were at one of the universities when we met.
Rhi: Duskwall Academy, which is…
Minna: It’s probably too nice an area for me to go when I’m wanted.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, it’s in Whitecrown, the wealthiest district in the city.
Minna: Maybe there’s a Nightmarket cafe we like.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: ‘Cause Nightmarket isn’t too skeevy.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s like the commercial district.
Minna: Yeah. I think there’s a Nightmarket cafe that we’ve gone to before that he likes, that I know he likes.
Rhi: Yeah. You get there and he is seated. It’s a table for two near one of the windows. He’s not in his uniform, he’s got his collar flipped up on his coat, and he’s slouched down in his chair with his arms crossed. He’s glaring at the table.
Minna: Myra, she steps in the door. She spots Jeren, who is not usually looking like this, and she has to take a moment to quell her sudden anxiety about the situation. She takes her seat without a word.
Rhi: He just looks up at you, and the glare remains in place. He is silently looking at you.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, Jeren. What have you heard?
Rhi (as Jeren): “What have I heard.” I have heard that you said you were just gonna do a little, quick in and out, and you just needed a little information from me.
Rhi: As he’s talking, he leans over the table. He’s angry, but he’s keeping his voice down.
Rhi (as Jeren): And then three officers were nearly beaten to death. One of them won’t be able to work again, Myra. She has permanent brain damage! You said you wouldn’t attack anybody, and a woman had her fucking skull caved in!
Minna: She keeps her cool but she doesn’t try to laugh it off or anything.
Minna (as Myra): That was unplanned and unfortunate.
Rhi (as Jeren): You think?
Minna (as Myra): I try to think about where I get information, who I’m getting into trouble. Believe me, I would not have put you in danger deliberately.
Rhi (as Jeren): No, that’s only ‘cause you know me. If you didn’t know who I was, if we didn’t have this history, I would be just as expendable to you as the rest of them. I know that a lot of the Bluecoats are crooked, but we’re people. We have lives and families. And now, one of us is gonna be spending the rest of her probably severely shortened life in a fucking hospital.
Minna (as Myra): Jeren—
Rhi (as Jeren): And it’s because of what I did for you.
Minna (as Myra): I understand. You don’t wanna be involved in this, and that’s honestly—
Rhi (as Jeren): You’ve been using me, Myra. You show up, you ask me for information. You smile and tell me that we’re such good friends and you just need this one little favor. And then this happens.
Minna: I think that she’s been sitting there with that kind of cool, polite air, like she’s gonna deal with this calmly. It’s not that her face necessarily falls, but she leans forward, too. This is deadly serious to her now.
Minna (as Myra): If we weren’t friends, I wouldn’t have known you for this long. I wouldn’t have kept your name away from my former employer. Believe me, Jeren. I don’t know how to make you believe me, but we’re friends.
Rhi (as Jeren): You’ve got a weird idea of friendship, Myra.
Rhi: He goes to start to stand. At this point, you’re gonna need to make a roll. This is partly your gather information roll. You’re gonna be at lesser effect with him, so even if you get a 6, the best you’re gonna be able to get out of him is standard information. But this is also going to be, basically, if you get a 3 or below, he’s gonna leave.
Minna: [sobbing laughter] Oh no.
Josie: Oh no.
Minna: So, consort?
Rhi: I think consort.
Minna: Ugh, no. The best one I got was a four.
Rhi: Okay, so that is limited.
Minna: I think she reaches up and grabs the cuff of his sleeve and tries to pull him back down.
Rhi: He stops. He doesn’t sit back down, but he stops when you grab him.
Minna (as Myra): I do have a strange idea of friendship. Before you, I didn’t have friends. So how this has happened, I don’t understand, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to keep this.
Rhi: He stands there, clearly struggling for a moment, where he’s still obviously very angry, but at the same time, you have kind of gotten through to him a little bit. After a second, he heaves this enormous sigh and sits back down, and just goes:
Rhi (as Jeren): I shouldn’t still be sitting here, but I don’t really have any other friends, either.
Minna (as Myra): Let me buy you a sandwich.
Rhi: You guys have lunch and talk. You’re able to smooth things over enough to where you can kind of ask him for information by the end and he doesn’t just throw his drink in your face and storm out.
Minna: I think what it looks like, because it’s more of… They’ve been chatting and she returns to the seriousness. She’s like:
Minna (as Myra): I know that I’ve been asking for more information of you than usual lately. It’s… It’s—
Rhi: He’s got his cup halfway to his face, and just stops and gives you this look.
Minna (as Myra): It’s not that it’s been a difficult time, it’s that it’s been a very active time. A lot has been thrown in my direction, and I think things are happening, finally. For real.
Rhi (as Jeren): So, you invited me out to lunch to ask for more information.
Minna (as Myra): No. No, I did not invite you out to lunch to ask for more information. I invited you out to lunch because I promised. Although, I kind of always need information at this point.
Rhi (as Jeren): He gives you a look of “okay, fine. What do you want?”
Minna (as Myra): If you happen to be able to know where I could find the names of some people whose names have been redacted from a report…
Rhi (as Jeren): I mean, that happens a lot.
Minna (as Myra): If it helps, they’re pretty bad news.
Rhi (as Jeren): That does not narrow it down in the slightest.
Minna (as Myra): Former leader of The Umbra Hunters.
Rhi (as Jeren): Okay, that helps.
Minna (as Myra): Sold out all the rest.
Rhi (as Jeren): Well, if they turned traitor to The Bluecoats and gave them a win like that, yeah, they wouldn’t have touched him. I don’t know off the top of my head.
Minna (as Myra): That’s understandable.
Rhi (as Jeren): But I can look into it. I’ll send something over to your usual guy at the one tavern. The Dog’s… Foot?
Minna (as Myra): The Hound’s Paw.
Rhi (as Jeren): I was close. [sigh] I’ll see what I can find, and I’ll send something over.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you. And I don’t know if I’ll ever not ask for information, but I’ll understand if you say no.
Rhi (as Jeren): See, that’s the problem, Myra, is that whenever you ask for information, it puts me in the position of, if I say yes, I don’t know what you’re gonna do with it. But if I say no and you end up getting hurt or killed, then I’m always gonna wonder if it was my fault.
Minna (as Myra): If I’m hurt or killed, that’s my responsibility, not yours. I live the life I lead. I haven’t gotten out of it. I could be doing something boring and surviving. I’m not.
Rhi (as Jeren): Boring’s not so bad. You might wanna consider it.
Rhi: This time, he stands up and goes to leave, but as he passes by, he squeezes your shoulder and then heads out.
Minna: I think Myra just buries her face in her hands and lets out the longest sigh, because that could have been so bad.
## [00:29:27] scene change
Rhi: So, where do you all reconvene?
Josie: It’s probably just back at The Nest, right?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: You guys all share your information, obviously. What are you planning to do with this information?
Minna: The thing that we’re really looking for is to get more information about these security guards. That’ll help us with the bigger aim of figuring out more about The Umbra Hunters.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: The advice Blaire was given was find out who is giving them their orders, because it seems like The Umbra Hunters are working the security at this club and carrying out on The Gondoliers, and probably doing other things you guys haven’t heard about yet, so figuring out who’s in charge of them would probably be useful information. If you’re just looking to corner a member of The Umbra Hunters, there’s a lot of different ways you can do that. Phin knows where two of them live.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: It’s possible we may not even have to deal with The Centuralia Club.
Rhi: You could also hang out with The Gondoliers and try to catch some of The Umbra Hunters when they’re attacking.
Josie: Unfortunately, all of those seem easier than doing something with The Centuralia Club.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: And less expensive.
Minna: Yeah, I think The Centuralia Club is big and shiny, and we kinda want to do it, but I don’t know if it’s the smart play, and I don’t think Myra would wanna be going for that.
Josie: Well, I suppose we should add it as a long-term goal for our crew, then.
Minna: [laughing] Yes.
Josie: Because that will be a significant score.
Rhi: So, what are you guys thinking you wanna do?
Josie: I’m leaning more towards trying to catch them in the act, ‘cause then, that way, we might get even more inkling as to their motive, as well.
Minna: Okay, you wanna hang out with The Gondoliers.
Josie: Indeed.
Minna: I’m fine with that.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: And perhaps we can go on a moonlight gondolier ride, while we’re at it. Did they ever say if there were certain locations that were more at risk, or do they just get attacked all over the canals?
Rhi: It mostly seems to be in Silkshore, Nightmarket, and Six Towers. Silkshore and Nightmarket are both areas that The Gondoliers can’t really avoid if they wanna make a decent amount of money. And Kay works in Nightmarket, mostly.
Josie: Yes, I say we do that.
Minna: Yeah.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: It takes a little bit of looking, ‘cause Kay is not at the same place when Blaire ran into her the first time. You guys have to check a few different docks before you find her again. She’s actually just brought some passengers and is helping them out, and then accepting their pay and sending them on their way. She sees the four of you approaching, and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Oh, you’re back. And you brought friends. Hello.
Josie (as Minx): Evening. Charmed. I’m Minx.
Rhi (as Kay): Kay.
Josie (as Minx): A pleasure.
Josie: Minx whispers to Blaire:
Josie (as Minx): Why didn’t you tell me about this person?
Kim (as Blaire): I— We did! We said we would meet the buff gondolier lady! We told you.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, just now.
Rhi (as Kay): What can I help you with?
Josie (as Minx): We were wondering if we could purchase/borrow your services for the night. It will be mutually beneficial in a fashion that should lead to the ceasing of the attacks.
Rhi (as Kay): Huh.
Madge (as Phin): We wanna ride with you until you get jumped.
Josie (as Minx): If we’re speaking plainly, yes.
Madge (as Phin): Why bother with dancing around the subject? That’s what we’re gonna do.
Rhi (as Kay): If I was by myself somewhere, they might be willing to give it a shot.
Minna (as Myra): With us in hiding?
Rhi (as Kay): Yeah. I mean, if you’re staging an ambush, that would be the idea.
Josie (as Minx): Would you be willing to put yourself out there like that? Not that you can’t handle yourself.
Rhi (as Kay): Well, I am pretty tired of having friends get beaten up. And, well, if you all think you can make this stop, I’d be willing to take a little bit of risk. Also, I have a gondola, and I can move surprisingly fast in it, so if I feel like things are getting a little more heated than I want to deal with, I will just leave.
Minna (as Myra): That’s fair.
Josie (as Minx): It sounds like we have an arrangement, then.
## [00:33:24] score begins
Rhi: Since it sounds like we’re moving into the score…
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It sounds like you guys are doing an Assault, honestly.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: I think an Assault, and the point is the dock where Kay stands alone.
Rhi: Okay. You are gonna be in a controlled position when the action starts.
We’re on the dock in Six Towers, in one of the canals. Kay is standing on the pier with one hand on the pole that she uses for her gondola. It’s still resting in the water, but she has a hand on it so that she can hit people with it when the time comes. I think you guys have to hang out for like a few hours.
But sure enough, after a while, a group of five people come walking down to the canal. You guys hear Kay go:
Rhi (as Kay): Ah, good evening. Do you need a lift?
Rhi: And a woman replies:
Rhi (as Umbra Thug): No, love. We just need some information.
Rhi: Where are you guys set up?
Josie: I feel like we should be near a bridge. That might be useful to have someone above on there, but also be able to get to the other side.
Rhi: Minx, do you wanna be up on the bridge?
Josie: Yes, I’ll be up there.
Rhi: Okay. Where is everyone else lying in wait?
Minna: I feel fairly close, but towards the bridge; closer to the bridge than the end of the dock.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, where are you?
Kim: Hm… Maybe I’m in a nearby alleyway? I am in the shadows, being all ninja-like.
Madge: I am hiding behind one of the crates, then.
Rhi: Okay. There’s a woman in the lead who is the one who’s questioning Kay. Basically, she’s up talking to Kay and the other four have formed a half circle around them, boxing Kay in at the end of the dock. Phin, you recognize two of the women.
Madge: Yeah. They’re the guards, aren’t they?
Rhi: Whoever wants to act first, basically, the controlled starting position means they have no idea that you’re here, and you will get the drop on them when you start your attack.
Josie: Okay. Can I go first?
Kim: Yeah. No, you probably have the most strategic position.
Josie: Okay. I think what I’m going to do is take a shot with my unusual weapon. That is to say, a bow and arrow. What I wanna do … And my justification for using Rook’s Gambit to use Sway instead of Hunt, is that I’m not actually caring about dealing all that much damage to them. I just want to pepper them with arrows and make them care about me, and get them distracted and scattered.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Okay. This is two 2s and a 1.
Rhi: Fortunately, it’s controlled. I’m gonna say that what happens is, you take aim, and then the woman in the lead gets right up in Kay’s personal space, and you’re suddenly worried about hitting Kay.
Josie: I think I’m gonna back off.
Rhi: Okay. Who wants to go next?
Madge: I guess I’ll start with the ones in back. I’m gonna barrel in. I wanna be causing as much noise and damage as possible so that I can use Wreck for that. [laughter]
Kim: Very on-brand.
Madge: Okay, I got two 6s and a 1.
Rhi: Two 6s is a critical hit.
Madge: Yay!
Rhi: That means that the person that you hit is just out.
Madge: Cool.
Rhi: Who do you wanna take out?
Madge: The one who’s my size. What I do, since I’m behind a crate, is I smash through the crate, tackle her, and do the one punch knockout.
Rhi: Yes. That does draw everyone else’s attention squarely on you.
[laughter]
Madge: Mission accomplished, I guess.
Rhi: Myra or Blaire, what do you guys wanna do?
Kim: I’ll just go with unusual weapon. Maybe it’s some kind of a very thin rapier or fencing sword. It’s very delicate. Blaire is going to try and get up close to one of them and try to disarm them.
Rhi: Okay. This is, at this point, gonna be risky, because they have been alerted that an attack is occurring. But yeah, go for it.
Kim: Okay. 5!
Rhi: I think you rush up on the nonbinary person. As you rush up, they whip around and have on brass knuckles. As you come in for the stab, they clock you across the face.
Kim: Oh, no!
Josie: [dismayed noise]
Rhi: You’re gonna take level 2 harm: Punched in the Face. You are welcome to roll Prowess to resist, but…
Kim: No, I’m gonna save my stress.
Rhi: I think anything that’s gonna require coordination or concentration is gonna be at a -1 die.
Kim: Two things I’m good at!
Rhi: All right, Myra.
Minna: I’m gonna try and keep my distance while still helping. I think that the thing that I have is, I guess, a pistol.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I’m gonna try shooting, which…
Rhi: Do you have anything in Hunt?
Minna: Nope. Guess I have to push myself.
Madge: I can distract.
Rhi: Okay. You wanna take a point of stress and assist?
Madge: Yes.
Minna: So, I’m gonna be rolling two dice, which is really not bad. Yes! 6!
Kim: Nice!
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I’m gonna shoot the lady with pistols. She could also shoot me.
Rhi: Sounds good. You hit her in the shoulder. As this fight breaks out, there’s a little bit of looking around, and then Kay just grabs the woman who was up in her face, and the two of them are just grappling now.
Josie: So it’s a bit of a brawl down there. I might as well get all sword-y and stabby, too. Who’s got someone on them?
Kim: Me.
Josie: I want to try to save Blaire.
Kim: Thank you!
Rhi: This is gonna be risky, standard effect.
Josie: Uh-huh. 6!
Kim: [cheer]
Josie: I see everything’s just gotten… It’s a clusterfuck now down there, so I just put my bow back. But then I see Blaire, the party baby, is in trouble, so I pull out my cane-sword, take a running hand-over-the-rail leap off the edge of the bridge leap, and land right there and come down from behind.
Rhi: Okay. That doesn’t take them out, but they out a cry of pain as you slash across their back.
Josie: She’s our precious demon baby. You stay away from her!
Kim: Aww.
[laughter]
Rhi: Aww.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, you really think that?
Josie (as Minx): Of course.
Madge: Can I do another punch?
Rhi: You sure can.
Madge: I’m gonna use my scary weapon, which is a set of brass knuckles that have extra spikes on them; brass knuckles that also curl around to the back of her hand.
Kim: Yes!
Madge: I’m gonna go for the man with all of the daggers.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky, standard effect.
Madge: Okay. So nervous. Those are both 2s.
Kim: Oh no.
Madge: [laughter]
Rhi: [sigh] Okay.
Madge: It was time. [laughter]
Rhi: You rush in to punch this guy, and he whips two daggers off of his bandolier and throws them at you. One of them, you’re able to dodge out of the way, but the other one just slices across your ribs.
Madge: [pained noise]
Rhi: So, it’s gonna be level 2 harm, which you can resist, if you would like. You’d be resisting with Prowess.
Madge: Well, I have 3 with that, ‘cause I’m a punch monster. Two 6s and a 3!
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: It’s gonna get knocked down to level 1 harm. You take no stress, and because you got two 6s, you actually clear a point of stress, if you have any.
Madge: Yo!
Kim: Yes!
Josie: Nice!
Rhi: If you critical on a resistance roll, you clear stress.
You twist out of the way of the first one and then mostly twist out of the way of the second. I think that’s just gonna be impeding anything physical – you’re gonna be at lesser effect. Who wants to go next?
Kim: I will. I will do that; I will go next. I need to redeem.
Rhi: All right. What are you gonna do?
Kim: I wanna get back at this guy with my sword.
Rhi: You are gonna be at -1 die.
Kim: So does that mean I roll nothing because I have 1 in Skirmish?
Rhi: You roll two d6 and take the lower, unless… if you wanna push yourself or try to get an assist.
Kim: No. [sigh] 3.
Rhi: 3?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: You take another stab at this person. They dodge out of the way and dip their shoulder down and charge into you, catch you in the stomach, and send you skittering back. You’re basically teetering on the edge of the dock.
Kim: [gasp] No!
Rhi: So you’re gonna be in a desperate position.
Kim: No!
Rhi: As an update, Kay and the lead woman are still fighting over on their section of the dock. They’re both a little bloodied; it doesn’t look like either one of them necessarily has the upper hand at this point. So, Myra?
Minna: All right. I gotta—
Madge: Save the baby!
Minna: [laugh] I’m thinking about what I could do helpfully.
Kim: I mean, you could fucking run up to me, grab my hand, and pull me up.
Minna: ‘Kay, yeah, I’ll do that. [laugh] Would it be a Finesse to get through that crowd?
Rhi: Well, Finesse or Prowl.
Minna: I have 1 in both, so it doesn’t much matter.
Rhi: So, it’s gonna be risky position, lesser effect.
Minna: Goddammit! I got a 2.
Rhi: As you try to rush past this person, they trip you, and you just go facedown into the dock. You smash your nose, and you have a bloody nose. That’s distracting and painful. Yeah, level 1 harm: Bloody Nose.
Minna: Do I resist that?
Rhi: You can resist. It would be with Prowess.
Minna: 4.
Rhi: 4? Okay. You’re gonna take two stress, but you manage to get your hands underneath yourself, and you do not smash face-first into the dock.
Josie: I wanna save the baby!
Minna: Aww.
Rhi: [laugh] All right. How are you going to save your precious demon baby?
Josie: Can I just put on a show of being threatening and go hog wild swinging on the person so they have to focus entirely on me?
Rhi: What skills are you planning on doing here?
Josie: I’m planning on using Sway.
Rhi: Okay, taking the two stress again?
Josie: Yeah, unfortunately.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Two 4s and a 5.
Rhi: You do it; you stab them. But you unfortunately leave yourself open. You hear the boards creaking behind you as the guy with the daggers steps in behind you to flank you. So, you’re now basically stuck between two people who are armed and angry. You are in a desperate position.
Josie: Mm. Hey, that means XP, right?
Madge: Can I get a revenge shot in on dagger man?
Rhi: Yeah, you can definitely try to.
Madge: I’m gonna go to smack him again with my spiky things, which will be especially frightening because he just stabbed me twice. Well, he tried to stab me twice and actually got me once.
Rhi: But you’re still coming.
Madge: Yeah. I feel that it happens like, I dodge out of the way and the other one hits me as I dodge, and I just look at it and swing at him again.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I hate these dice.
Rhi: What’d you get?
Madge: My highest is a 2.
Rhi: Oh no. I think what I am gonna do at this point is I’m gonna start that clock, ‘cause this scrap has been going on for a little bit. There’s been some noise, there’s been some yelling, so we have a Bluecoat alert, one out of four. That’s the complication. The guy with the daggers dodges out of the way and shoves you back.
Kim: I need to get up.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire, you’re still wavering at the edge of the dock.
Madge: Oh, kiddo.
Rhi: Myra, you are face down on the dock.
Minna: What if I try and sneak towards Kay’s gondola to get it under Blaire?
Rhi: Yeah, you could try to do that. I think that’s gonna be Prowl.
Minna: That is a thing I can do without pushing myself. Yes! I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. You rush over to the gondola. Kay left her pole propped up against the pier. You grab that, and you’re able to push the gondola over, and it floats over behind Blaire. As you do that, you hear two pistols go off.
Kim: Oh, fuck.
Minna: Oh.
Rhi: The shots don’t hit you, but the additional noise ticks up that clock. Okay, Blaire, now do you wanna do something?
Kim: Is there a way I can maneuver my way onto the gondola either by just straight up falling, or do I have to finesse some kind of jump to get down there?
Rhi: If you’re trying to fall into it without hurting yourself, it’s probably gonna be Prowl. You are still gonna be in a desperate position because that was the consequence for last time. Good news, you get experience in Prowess.
Kim: [sigh] I got a two, my dudes.
Rhi: Okay. You fall backwards, do not make it into the gondola. You are in the river—
Kim: No!
Rhi: Are gonna have to deal with getting out of the river.
Kim: And it’s probably cold as shit.
Rhi: Oh, it’s extremely cold, and you can feel stuff moving.
Kim: Uh…
Madge: So what would Kim have to roll for getting out of there?
Rhi: It’s probably gonna be Prowl.
Madge: Blaire, how’s your Prowl?
Kim: My Prowl’s all right. I have one rank in Prowl.
Madge: Okay. I’m gonna jump in the water. [laugh]
Rhi: Okay. Since you’re entering the water in a more controlled, deliberate fashion, it’s gonna be risky.
Madge: Okay. And then I’m gonna push myself to give myself an extra die. I’m so scared! [laughter]
Rhi: I am also scared for you.
Madge: [laughter] Oh my gosh!
Rhi: What did you get? I can’t tell if it’s good or not.
Madge: [laughing] I got snake eyes!
Rhi: Holy shit. She got snake eyes.
Kim: [sigh]
Minna: Oh, no!
Madge: Oh my gosh!
Rhi: Okay, let’s see.
Madge: Oh my heck!
Rhi: I think what it is, it’s, again, you just lose the opportunity. You’re not able to get to her. You’re both just kind of flailing around in the canal.
Josie: Oh, dear.
Rhi: Kay, having seen two of you go into the water, she’s going to attempt to break away from the other woman and try to help you guys out. She got a 5.
The woman that she’s been grappling with, she throws into the woman who has the pistols, and then is going to rush over and hold her pole out to, probably, Blaire. She’s leaving herself open to attack by doing this. Blaire, you’re gonna have an assist in getting out of here. Who wants to act in the meantime?
Josie: Me.
Rhi: All right, what are you doing?
Josie: There’s a guy in front of me who’s very injured, and a guy behind me who’s not injured?
Rhi: Correct.
Josie: This is gonna be directed towards the person who’s not injured: pocket sand.
[laughter]
Kim: I love it.
Josie: Good ol’ pocket sand.
Rhi: Yup. Throw that trance powder.
Josie: What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: This is the last of your trance powder. You’re gonna have to spend a downtime action to get more.
Josie: God, I already have so many downtime actions I wanna do. But you know what? I’m gonna take it. I really want this to work. [dice rattling] Double 6s!
Rhi: Okay. I think what happens is, you whip around, and as this guy is coming towards you, he’s got daggers in both hands. He takes a breath to say something cool and menacing as he stabs you, and instead, as he’s taking that breath, you just throw the trance powder in his face. He drops both daggers and just goes slack-jawed, and is staring into the middle distance.
Josie: [laughing] Get rekt.
Kim: Fantastic.
Rhi: And is effectively out of the fight.
Josie: No, you guys don’t get to do one-liners. That’s our thing.
Rhi: Okay, who wants to act next?
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna catch Minx’s eye.
Minna (as Myra): All right, get this guy into the gondola. I’ll try and get everyone else in.
Josie (as Minx): All right, dear.
Minna: Who’s in the drink right now? Blaire is being helped by Kay, and Phin is…?
Madge (as Phin): Hi!
Minna: Okay. I’m gonna try and help Phin into the gondola.
Madge (as Phin): Thank you.
Minna: Okay. I think I have enough stress left that I’m going to push myself.
Rhi: Phin, if you’re willing to take the point of stress, you can assist.
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: What the fuck? I got two 6s and a 4.
Madge: That’s awesome!
Minna: And she is going to climb into the gondola herself, reach a hand out to Phin, and haul her over the side and into the boat. Probably, Phin falls against her, because that’s what happens when you pull someone into a boat.
Madge: Yes.
Rhi: Blaire, do you wanna try to—
Kim: I would like to do basically the same.
Rhi: Kay is assisting you, so I’m gonna say that gives you improved position.
Kim: 5.
Rhi: 5, okay. You do it but there’s gonna be a minor consequence.
Kim: Maybe I drop something in the river; one of my belongings or something.
Rhi: Yeah, that works.
Kim: [gasp] One of my acorns! One of my acorns drops into the river.
Rhi: Oh! Oh, god, yeah, that’s a good one. I mean, that’s really tragic, but that’s good.
Kim: [dismayed noises] Oh no. All right, I’ll mark my three acorns to two.
Rhi: Yeah. But! You’re in the boat!
Madge: [cheer]
Rhi: All the people who are in the water are now in the gondola.
Madge: Yay! Can I do a shoot?
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: Yes!
Rhi: Who are you shooting at?
Madge: Let’s do the leader.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. I think you get her in the leg, and she staggers. Minx, you and Kay are the only ones still on the doc.
Josie: Okay. I wanna unceremoniously push trance powder guy into the boat and get the fuck out.
Rhi: Okay. I think it’s gonna be either Skirmish or Prowl.
Josie: I’m gonna push myself about it. 4.
Rhi: I haven’t shot you yet, have I?
Josie: No.
Kim: Oh my god.
Rhi: All right.
Josie: I seem to get not attacked very often in fights.
Rhi: Well, guess what’s about to happen? You do a rush, grab this guy around the waist, and jump for the boat. As you’re jumping, you hear a “No!” And then a pistol goes off, and you feel a bullet rip through your side. You and the guy tumble into the boat. You have level 2 harm, but you are in the boat. All four of you are now in the boat, so Kay tosses a salute at the remaining people, swings into the boat, and begins pulling away very frantically.
Josie: [laughter]
## [00:52:01] scene change
Rhi: Yeah, you guys make it away with a captive who—
Madge: Yay!
Rhi: His night is going great right now. Things are fantastic for him. The rest of you are bleeding and soaked, and he’s just staring into space and grinning. Kay continues to pole along down the canal as you guys sort yourselves out. Your captive is half-sprawled on the bottom of the gondola, staring up at the tunnel ceiling, and smiling vacantly.
Madge: I kick him.
Rhi (as Captive): [Bleary grunt] Ow.
Minna (as Myra): No need for that.
Madge (as Phin): Plenty of need.
Josie (as Minx): I do believe we’re gonna have to start with the good cop approach here.
Madge (as Phin): No…
Kim (as Blaire): Seriously?
Josie (as Minx): I don’t think he’s going to respond well to—
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no shit.
Josie (as Minx): The aggressive approach.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, you try your way, and then when it doesn’t work, we’ll see that me punching the living life out of him is just as good.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, you are quite good at that, but at least give me a shot here.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, if he’s inebriated, maybe he’ll be more compelled to tell the truth. I don’t know.
Josie (as Minx): Now, dear, we’re safe here. We’re your friends. We made you feel all happy, didn’t we? We just want a few answers to our questions, and you can keep feeling happy like this. How does that sound?
Rhi: It takes a couple seconds for his eyes to find your face. He just smiles at you really blearily. Go ahead and make, I’m guessing, a Sway roll.
Josie: Uh, critical.
Madge: Ayyy.
Rhi: Jesus Christ, okay.
Josie: [laughter]
Madge: Pew pew pew pew!
Rhi: You are gonna be able to get basically whatever you want out of this guy.
Rhi (as Captive): [slurring heavily] Yeah, yeah. It’s some real good shit you got.
Josie (as Minx): And there is more where that came from, let me tell you.
Josie: Completely ignoring the fact that I am specifically quite out of it.
Madge: Mhmm!
[laughter]
Rhi: [laugh] Yep. He doesn’t know, though.
Josie: Yeah. I’m gonna ask him who gives him his orders. I’m just gonna be super blunt about it.
Rhi (as Captive): [slurring] Oh. Um, Harvale? You know, what do you wanna know about him?
Josie (as Minx): We’re just looking to make more friends. They’re your friends and we’re friends, so I figure we should be friends.
Rhi (as Captive): [slurring] Yeah, yeah. You should. He’d like this stuff. This is good stuff. You could sell it at the club. Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): The club?
Josie (as Minx): The club? Do you mean—
Rhi (as Captive): [slurring] Yeah. The centur-us, center-y, cen—
Josie (as Minx): The Centuralia Club, yes.
Rhi (as Captive): Yeah. Yeah, that one. He owns it, and he could— he’s— the good… This is some good, good stuff, and he could sell it there if you guys were all friendly friends…
Josie (as Minx): That does sound like a good idea. I think I will have to bring some to him, and we could be “friendly friends.” So, you and your friends, what is it, exactly, that you do? How are you having fun?
Rhi (as Captive): Oh. What? What do you mean? Like…
Josie (as Minx): You were told to go ask about Kotar, and you have friendly conversations with The Gondoliers. I just want to know why.
Rhi (as Captive): Harvale says to go ask about this stuff. It’s him and his friends. Uh, the… His new group. They wanna know about this stuff, and so we go, and we ask. And then The Gondoliers don’t tell us what we wanna know, so we gotta break their skulls.
Rhi: Kay scowls at that and just glares back.
Minna (as Myra): Now, did Harvale… You mentioned his “new group.” Was his old group The Umbra Hunters?
Rhi (as Captive): Yeah. Yeah, he used to be my boss with them, and then everybody else got arrested, and he took over the club, and joined this new group, and it’s… It’s been great, ‘cause I get paid a lot more, and when I work at the guard at the club, it’s like… It’s so much nicer. You don’t have to go out on the street and beat people up all the time. You get to just sit in this nice, fancy house and watch rich people piss their money away. [laugh]
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, you get to beat up innocent gondoliers who don’t know anything, and that gets you paid more money. It’s great.
Rhi (as Captive): Yeah…
Madge (as Phin): Can I punch him now?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! No, no, no. No, I wanna ask a question. I wanna!
Madge (as Phin): Fine.
Josie (as Minx): I promise, when we’re done.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. No, you can beat the shit out of this guy when we’re done.
Madge (as Phin): Great.
Rhi (as Captive): Uh, that doesn’t sound like a lot of fun.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, she’s joking.
Madge (as Phin): You’ll feel awesome after.
Rhi (as Captive): [laugh] Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Why were you and your buddies looking for a thing called Kotar?
Rhi (as Captive): Because the boss wanted it. I don’t know what any of that shit is. He just… He says to ask about this stuff, and so we ask, and then if we find anything out, we go back and tell him.
Josie (as Minx): Have you found anything out?
Rhi (as Captive): Not really. I’m starting to think they maybe actually don’t know anything.
Madge (as Phin): Gee, I wonder why.
Minna: I think Myra leans over.
Minna (as Myra): And what’s your name?
Rhi (as Captive): They call me Lark.
Josie (as Minx): All right, Lark. Nice to meet you. And this is our friend, Phin. And Phin, Lark. Now, I think it’s about time for you to make acquaintance.
Rhi: He kind of rolls his head to the side to look at Phin.
Madge (as Phin): Hey there, buddy. [laugh] I punch him!
[laughter]
Minna: Myra winces.
Rhi: So, you beat him up. Do you just beat him into unconsciousness?
Madge: Yeah. I beat him ‘til he blacks out, and then I back off.
Rhi: Okay. So, now there is a bloody, unconscious man in the back of the gondola. Where would you like to be dropped off, ‘cause she’ll take you wherever you wanna go at this point.
Madge: What’s the exit closest to that prissy fencing school?
Rhi: Over in Crow’s Foot? I mean, yeah, she can take you up there. I think if you asked for that, she’s gonna kinda give you a look and be like:
Rhi (as Kay): Yeah, sure. Why do you wanna head up there?
Madge (as Phin): I have reasons.
Rhi: Kay looks at Phin, and then looks over at the other three of you, raises an eyebrow, like, “should I?” [laugh] “You all cool with this?” [laugh]
Josie (as Minx): It is generally best to comply, yes.
Rhi: She’ll take that detour. It takes you guys a little bit to get up there.
Josie (as Minx): Can I try to chat her up on the way over?
Rhi: Oh, yeah.
Minna: Minx!
Rhi: While bleeding. She’s a little distracted with the gondoliering, and seems to be fairly concerned about the fact that you are bleeding from a bullet hole in your shoulder?
Josie: Listen, I’m taking care of it.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s more she’s a little bit like, “You know, this is a weird time to flirt, but sure. Why not?” So, the flirting is going well.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: As you guys get to the dock close to The Red Sashes’ headquarters… Phin?
Madge: Yeah. Is there like a bench across from the school near where I was just loitering and staring?
Rhi: Sure.
Madge (as Phin): Cool. I’m gonna set him on that bench.
[gasping, laughter]
Madge (as Phin): I’m just gonna leave him there, and I’m gonna walk away.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: Okay. I think Kay is just kind of like:
Rhi (as Kay): All right.
Rhi: She’ll take you guys back and drop you off, you know, somewhere in Six Towers. She’s helping you all out, and Minx, as she helps you out, she’s like:
Rhi (as Kay): You should really get that taken care of.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, yes. I’ll handle it posthaste. Though, before I go, I should say, if there’s any more trouble, or if you simply wanna see more of each other, you can find us at The Hound’s Paw.
Rhi: She grins and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): I was just about to ask.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: Steps back into her gondola and says:
Rhi (as Kay): Be careful. And I’ll see you around.
Josie (as Minx): Evening.
## [01:00:42] downtime: Phin
Rhi: Phin. What do we get to see Phin do?
Madge: Sawtooth patching her up.
Rhi: What was her injury?
Madge: She was working on getting the rest of the shrapnel.
Rhi: Do you guys all go to Sawtooth individually or do you show up as a group?
Kim: And we’re all sitting in the waiting room? I kinda like that, actually.
[laughter]
Madge: Yeah, I like that too.
Rhi: Okay. Madge, what does Sawtooth look like?
Madge (as Phin): [laughter]
Rhi: I feel like with a name like “Sawtooth,” he is an intensely sketchy dude.
Madge: Yeah, he’s so sketchy. I picture him looking like Tom Hardy.
[laughter]
Madge (as Phin): Like Tom Hardy with the giant scar from over where his canine is on his lip, all the way up over his eye.
Rhi: You come in and tell him about the shrapnel that you’ve got lodged in your arm that has been there for weeks.
[laughter]
Rhi: He spends the next 20 minutes with a scalpel and tweezers poking and prodding at your arm, and making small cuts to dig out whatever shrapnel he can find. And lecturing you, almost without pause, the entire time about how incredibly stupid you were to leave this for so long.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): There’s scar tissue grown over it, and this could have gotten infected. Do you wanna lose your whole arm?
Madge (as Phin): How cool would the scar have looked?
Rhi: I mean, it’s a pretty cool scar, but the scar is being added to, ‘cause he’s cutting. He’s having to cut into your arm to dig the rest of the shrapnel out. He does that for a little bit and then bandages you up, and is like:
Rhi (as Sawtooth): I wasn’t able to get everything, probably because it’s super deep in there. I’m gonna need a magnet to find the rest, but that’s what I can do for now. Once that heals up some, I’ll get back to work on the rest. If you get shot again, please come and see me right away.
Madge (as Phin): I had a fight to go to after.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): [dismayed sigh]
Madge (as Phin): Pretty sure.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): Send in whichever one of your friends is next.
Rhi: Phin gets lectured by her doctor.
## [01:02:45] downtime: Myra
Rhi: Myra, what do you do on your downtime?
Minna: Let’s do the indulge one’s vice scene.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I think she winds her way a familiar route from The Hound’s Paw to The Devil’s Tooth. It’s probably one of those Tudor-y style buildings with the dark wood beams across it. It looks relatively legitimate from the outside, but you walk in and everything’s dark. There’s little, dangly sparkly things that you can’t quite see in the darkness, and, I think, lamps with red glass covers and such; just very, almost, spooky or mysterious inside. I think I have a long-standing arrangement. I don’t even necessarily go up to her and talk to her; she just kind of nods at me across the room. I go and see which one of the rooms is free, and open the door and go inside.
I think sometimes dream smoke is enough, but, I think, in this case, she had so much stress that it’s black lotus. You mostly just see smoke more than anything happening, and then there’s a couch. You see her stretch out and close her eyes, and almost look like she’s going to sleep, just a long sigh of relief.
Rhi: You wanna tell us one vision that she has, ‘cause it induces visions.
Minna: We see a red lamp turn into a green lamp. The walls are covered in shelves full of books, and it’s dark and silent. She’s in a library, alone. Sort of fades to black from there.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: That’s very good, and the nerdiest goddamn thing.
Minna: Do you wanna know what’s worse? It’s totally the library she and Jeren hung out in the night they met.
Josie and Rhi: Aww!
Rhi: Friends!
## [01:04:24] downtime: Minx
Rhi: Minx, I believe you are finding a new vice purveyor.
Josie: Yeah. The lack of wall decoration and getting the painting from the heist got her inspired, so I think her new kick is gonna be works of fine art. I think she makes a good impression by coming right in, being enthusiastic, and making a really high-profile purchase. I’m thinking this is maybe like a cityscape or something, and it goes on the adjacent wall to the other painting. But it’s not super big, so the edges kind of bump up against each other.
Rhi: Cool. I like it.
Josie: [laughter]
## [01:05:08] downtime: Blaire
Rhi: All right. Blaire.
Kim: I imagine Blaire goes to Aranna the Blessed again. She’s bragging about, like, “we’re getting to learn about The Circle of Flame, and we interrogated this dude and we’re learning all this cool shit. This is really awesome. I’m gonna learn the cool stuff.”
Rhi: I think when you start talking about wanting to learn more occult things, she pulls out some books, let you read through them, and talk to you about, essentially, occult histories of Duskwall. There’s gonna be the official history of Duskwall, which is more political-focused. These are looking at the different cults and forgotten gods and demonic influences that have played a role in the city.
Kim (as Blaire): Can I borrow them?
Kim: Her eyes are so wide right now, you guys. There are probably stars.
Rhi (as Aranna): These are fairly rare tomes. I would prefer they not leave my sight. But you are welcome to—
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Yeah, no, no, that’s fine! I respect that.
Rhi (as Aranna): You are welcome to stay here for as long as you wish.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Rhi: I imagine that’s where the overindulging is, ‘cause you hang out there for like eight hours.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): She is just setting up red thread all over the walls and stuff, crazy-eyed. It’s probably like 3 AM.
Rhi: At which point Aranna is like:
Rhi (as Aranna): I believe that your mind has been as filled as it can be. You should go.
Rhi: And—
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, no. I have room!
Rhi: Gently escorts you out.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, but we’ll do this again next week, right?
Rhi (as Aranna): Of course, my child.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, bye!
Rhi: Closes the door and starts taking all of the red—
Kim (as Blaire): [calling from distance] Thank you!
Rhi: Just starts taking all of the string off of her wall, muttering to herself.
Kim: [laughter]
## [01:06:53] scene change
Rhi: Do you guys wanna reconvene at The Hound’s Paw?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Minx, I think that you perk up right away, because Kay is sitting on one of the barstools.
Josie: Yay!
Rhi: Rigney is chatting with her. As soon as you guys walk in, he straightens up. Usually, when you guys come in, he’s happy to see you. He looks kind of worried this time. He circles around the bar, grabs something out from underneath it as he comes out. He has an envelope in his hand that he gives to Myra, and says:
Rhi (as Rigney): This came in for you. A young man dropped it off. Your friend here wanted to wait to talk to you, which is fine, but it’s not really safe for you all to be here right now.
Josie (as Minx) and Madge (as Phin): What?
Rhi (as Rigney): There were some inspectors who came around, who were asking some rather pointed questions about you. I didn’t tell them anything, but they didn’t seem too happy about the fact I didn’t tell them anything. I’m pretty sure that they will be coming back at some point, so I think, probably, it’d be better for everybody if you give this place a bit of a wide berth for a while.
Madge (as Phin): I understand. Got a little bit too comfortable.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, dear.
Rhi (as Rigney): It’s not a permanent thing. If one of you wants to stop by the back door maybe in a week or so to see how things are—
Madge (as Phin): In a week or so? In the back?
Rhi (as Rigney): Listen. I don’t wanna go to jail. I don’t want any of you to go to jail.
Josie (as Minx): I think we will simply need to take our refreshments somewhere else for a week, at least.
Rhi (as Rigney): I wish you didn’t have to. I like having you here; you’re good for business. But worse for business to have inspectors or Bluecoats bust in and arrest people. Or me! If I get arrested, it’s very bad for business. I’ll hang onto any messages that come in for you, as usual, but yeah, I think that might be for the best.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Josie (as Minx): Very well.
Rhi: I think Kay, with that, shrugs and downs the rest of her drink, puts a few coins in the bar, and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Well, it was nice to meet up, but gonna be heading out with them.
Rhi: Rigney looks sad as you all head back outside 30 seconds after coming in.
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna stop as they leave and thank him for the warning.
Rhi (as Rigney): I like you guys. You’re good customers, good for business, good friends. Don’t wanna see anything happen to you.
Minna (as Myra): We feel the same way.
Rhi (as Rigney): Thanks. Like I said, stop by in a week, see how things are looking.
Minna (as Myra): Will do.
Rhi: You guys are now outside. [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): [laugh] I think, to wrap up, I’m gonna have a nice evening with Kay around the town, maybe. [laughter]
Rhi: All right. We’ve got some leads on The Circle of Flame and The Centuralia Club, and Minx has a date.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: That is where we will pick up next time.

Rhi: I will say, you guys were rolling very well at the start of this, and then it just went off the rails.
Josie: Mhmm.

## intro music
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us. If you haven’t yet, please consider leaving us a rating or review. The more reviews we get, the more people will find the show. And if you have left us a review, thank you so much. Every review we get absolutely makes our day.
Next, one thing about today’s episode. I want to give a content warning for some discussion and description of dead bodies in this score. It isn’t super graphic, but it is a little more detailed than we normally have on the show. If you’re uncomfortable with that sort of thing, it might be better to skip over the descriptions. I’ll include timestamps for the descriptions in the show notes.
This month’s featured charity is Masjid al-Rabia, a Chicago-based mosque for queer, trans, women, and marginalized Muslims, who may feel out of place in both mainstream Muslim communities and queer communities. Masjid al-Rabia is centered on five pillars of inclusivity: women-centered, anti-racist, LGBTQIA+ affirming, pluralist, and accessible. Their programming includes weekly prayer services, a free library, a family arts program, and prison outreach initiatives. If you have a few dollars to spare, consider making a donation. A link to their site is in the show notes.
Now, then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## [00:01:32] story resumes
Rhi: We’ll start off the morning after you guys had talked to Rigney and found out that the Inspectors were sniffing around. It’s not really super safe for you guys to be around there. He’s concerned about you all getting arrested.
So, what is the morning routine at The Nest like? Who wakes up first? Who makes breakfast? When does Minx stagger in from her date night with Kay?
Minna: [squeal]
Josie: [laughing] Oh, right. Yeah, I was doing that.
Rhi: You were out having a very nice night.
Josie: Yeah. Minx is coming back pretty early. So who’s up early?
Madge: Not me.
Minna: Myra.
Josie: Minx comes back in with a cloak over her. She’s still in the clothes she was wearing yesterday, and somewhat disheveled. She, in a rare circumstance, has her hair down, ‘cause it’s usually in sort of a practical bun-type thing with a braid around it, pulled back. But now it’s down and uncharacteristically messy. This is probably one of the few times you’ve seen her without makeup, as well. She comes in, looks at you, and says:
Josie (as Minx): Um, uh, oh. Um, uh, good morning, dear.
Minna (as Myra): Good morning. You had a good night?
Josie (as Minx): That’s one way of putting it. Mhm, yup. Hold on, let my put myself together.
Josie: And she picks up way too much speed and speeds into her bedroom to get ready, and you hear:
Josie (as Minx): [thump] Ow.
Josie, Minna, and Rhi: [laughter]
Josie: Actually, for the rest of the morning, Minx is kind of out of it. Not sad, definitely happy, but out of it.
Rhi: Distracted.
Josie: Yes.
Minna: Myra quietly makes a second cup of whatever kind of hellish tea they have in this universe.
Rhi: It’s probably mushroom-based. What’s Myra doing up this early? She just enjoying tea and having a quiet moment? Is she…
Minna: I think in the morning, that’s when she gets stuff done. If she has a thing she’s reading or she has some plans to sketch out, that’s when she can rely on having a quiet minute in the house—or, in The Nest, I should say.
Rhi: Yeah. Who gets up next?
Kim: I will say that Blaire gets up next. The door to her room just creaks open very loudly. It hasn’t been oiled in a while; she has a very noisy door. She just cracks open slightly. It’s very dark inside. She comes out. She’s very bleary-eyed; her hair is poofier and bigger than it usually is, and she looks a little grouchy. She doesn’t even say anything, she just kinda peter-patters over to, I guess, the main room, where the table is. She just slumps over in a chair and puts her head on the table.
Madge: Leaves Phin for last, I guess. I figure she comes out of her room, and she’s completely put together for the day, which is not saying much for Phin. She has clothes on that are pretty much clean, her hair is combed, and she’s wearing her boots. She comes out and gets to work on procuring food.
Josie: When Minx comes out for food, she’s more put together but is wearing a much higher collar than usual.
Everyone: [laughter]
Kim: Yes!
Minna: I have a dumb, dumb question. [laugh]
Josie: What?
Minna: So, these people are all living, basically, in a house together. What is their situation with regards to food? Do they have any communal food or is it all jealously-hoarded own food?
Josie: Minx is willing to share her food.
Josie (as Minx): Just as long as you’re waiting for it to be done up properly, dears.
Minna: [laughter]
Madge: Phin does not provide food. She’s surprisingly picky. Not picky picky. Like, she picks off of other people. Whatever they’re eating she’ll just grab a little bit of it.
Minna: [laughing] Doesn’t eat her own food?
Madge: Nope. She just goes with whatever’s available.
Minna: I feel like Myra eventually just starts making larger meals.
Josie, Kim, and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. You guys are having breakfast, or tea, or laying face down on the table.
Josie, Kim: [laughter]
Josie: Also, did we look that envelope yet?
Rhi: Good question. Myra, have you looked in the envelope that Rigney gave you?
Minna: I think she probably has. I think she would have done it when she got to her own room and she could read it in privacy.
Rhi: Yeah. Basically, that was the payoff of your gather information check with Jeren. Jeren’s information includes the full name of the owner of The Centuralia Club and the person who was giving the orders to attack The Gondoliers. His name is Harvale Brogan. There isn’t a ton of information that Jeren was able to get that you don’t already have. He bought The Centuralia Club about six years ago. The ownership of the club has always been kept mysterious; it’s part of the general air of the place, is that getting to meet the owner or know the owner is another one of those status markers. So most people don’t know. And now you guys do.
Minna: I think Myra summarizes it for them rather than giving them the letter.
Josie (as Minx): I still find ourselves, even after this windfall, distressingly lacking in information. We do have some context, but I’m not certain we can pull in all the info ourselves, as much as I hate to admit that.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I do miss the days of having a wider network. I think it’s time we worked on building that up.
Madge (as Phin): Mhmm.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): It would save us a lot of time.
Josie (as Minx): Although, it sounds like you have experience in that and might know where to start, yes?
Minna (as Myra): Some, yes. From scratch, it’s going to be a bit of a challenge. But I think it’s about time we planted that seed.
Rhi: Myra, you do, because of your background, have some information and insight on how to build an information network. Building one from the ground up is the work of months, if not years. However, there is a nice shortcut you can take, and that people will often take, which is where you basically co-opt an established network. Particularly among the criminal organizations in this city, it’s a fairly common thing, because, again, a lot of people don’t wanna put in the time to build their own network, so they just sort of steal other people’s. Myra, you know that a lot of the criminal organizations in this city have already-established information networks. You also know that Salia has one, if that’s something you wanted to go after.
Minna: Oh God. She definitely wants to eventually. I don’t know if she’s there yet.
Josie: And The Gondoliers don’t especially count, right? ‘Cause they’re kind of their own entity.
Rhi: I mean, The Gondoliers do get a decent amount of information.
Josie: Mhmm.
Minna: That’s why The Umbra Hunters were after them, right?
Rhi: Right. And yeah, that could be a potential option, as well, to see if they would be willing to act as an information network for you all.
Minna: Another option regarding Salia is that we could peel off just a piece of her network? I don’t know if that would be useful; just suggesting that as a possible option.
Josie: I’d either say that or try to get The Gondoliers to be our informants.
Minna: They could also be very, very good.
Kim: We’re already in kinda good with Kay, at least.
Josie: [chuckle]
Kim: I would say that’d be a good group.
Josie: Do I know if she has any pull or if she’s just a normal gondolier?
Rhi: She could probably tell you who some of the leaders are.
Josie: She could likely vouch for us if it comes to that, but I wouldn’t wanna put undue pressure on her to get us in with them. Especially since I don’t want it to seem like I’m using her.
Kim: Well, you’re not the only person who can ask. We can go as a group or send someone else. It’s fine.
Josie: But yeah, Gondoliers is my vote.
Kim: I think my vote is also for Gondoliers.
Madge: Yeah, it just makes sense.
Minna: Yeah.
## [00:10:12]
Rhi: Okay. If you guys want to try to talk to The Gondoliers to see if they’re gonna be willing to become, officially, your information network. How do you wanna approach that?
Josie: I mean, we could ask Kay to just introduce us.
Kim: We could.
Josie: That would probably be the simplest, rather than bumming around district trying to persuade someone.
Madge:: And she probably wouldn’t mind, you know?
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: She already knows us.
Rhi: I think, Minx, in the course of your date last night, Kay talked about her normal route, where she works—partially so that you could look her up again in the future. Minx is able to lead you to one of the canal docks in Nightmarket. Once again, Kay is hanging out on the pier. She seems to be in a pretty good mood, is chatting with a couple other gondoliers, notices the four of you come down, and straightens up and waves.
Rhi (as Kay): Yeah, these are them. These are the ones I was telling you about.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi!
Josie (as Minx): Oh, you’re speaking of us. Excellent.
Madge (as Phin): Hey.
Josie (as Minx): By the way, dear, how are you doing this morning?
Rhi: She glances at your collar and smirks.
Rhi (as Kay): I’m doing just fine, thank you.
Rhi: And gives you a wink.
Josie (as Minx): Glad to hear it.
Josie: Wink back.
Rhi (as Kay): So, what can I do for you this morning? Hopefully no further ambushes—I think we all might need a little time to recover from the last one.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, certainly not. It is, unfortunately, some manner of business, though. We simply need to, regarding recent events, talk to… superior, of a sort? We simply lack the knowledge of who or how, and was wondering if you could provide that, of course.
Rhi (as Kay): You want just a name, or an introduction?
Madge (as Phin): An introduction. We need to start getting a network together.
Rhi (as Kay): [grunt]
Josie (as Minx): If it’s not too much trouble.
Rhi (as Kay): Well, I’m happy to help. But if you’re looking for something a little more broad, you would need to talk to Eisele. She’s the one in charge.
Rhi: She steps back and gestures at her gondola. She’s managed to clean up most of the bloodstains.
Josie: Excellent. [laugh]
Rhi: Most of them.
Josie: [laughing] Most.
Rhi: Still a few. Yeah. You guys all hop into the gondola, and she takes you up to the canals. As you guys get into Crow’s Foot, you can tell as soon as you’ve gotten into the district, because you see a pair of bodies floating face down.
Kim: Oh.
Josie: Oh, jeez.
Rhi: They are, based on what they’re wearing, members of The Red Sashes. Both look like they’ve been shot. Kay sees them, looks around, just making a glance around of the area. Not like she’s looking for people, but just being sort of like “okay, this is my location.” She stops the gondola for a second, and her eyes glow blue, the same way that Blaire’s do when she’s looking into the ghost field.
Josie: [gasp]
Kim: Oh.
Josie: She’s magic.
Rhi: She does that for a second, and then comes out.
Rhi (as Kay): All right. Their spirits are still in there. I’ll send somebody to pick them up once we get there.
Rhi: About 10 minutes later, she brings you to an underground dock that then extends backwards into a bit of a cavern that has a small building built back there; a small boathouse, basically. She brings her gondola up. There’s another of other gondolas there; some that have been pulled out of the water, that look like they are in various stages of repair. There’s a number of people milling around, talking. A few of them wave at Kay as she steps out. Kay leads you back to the boathouse, knocks on the door, and then you hear a voice from inside.
Rhi (as Voice from Inside): Who is it?
Rhi (as Kay): Kay. I have some people here who wanna talk to you.
Rhi (as Voice from Inside): Yeah, send them on in.
Rhi: Kay opens up the door, ushers you all inside. It’s a small room with a couple doors leading out. In this room there’s a desk, a couple electroplasmic lights. The walls are covered in maps of the canals, of the city, that have all kinds of notations in various shorthand and symbols on them. Sitting at the desk is an older woman; she looks like she’s probably in her 50s or 60s. She’s got silver hair that is tied back in a really tight bun; scar across her forehead.
Rhi (as Old Woman): Ah. What’s making you bring guests in?
Rhi: Kay just says:
Rhi (as Kay): They wanted to talk to you; had some interest in utilizing our services more broadly. There’s a couple corpses back around the Crossfire junction, so I’m gonna go and…
Rhi: The woman at the desk is like:
Rhi (as Eisele): Yes, yes. Go. Please, pick them up.
Rhi: Kay gives you all a wave and tells you she’ll be back, and then heads out.
Josie (as Minx): Be safe.
Rhi: The woman at the desk looks the four of you over.
Rhi (as Eisele): So, what can I do for you?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, given that you have been graciously doing business with us in matters of boating and otherwise, and given recent developments regarding your business, we were, to move straight to the point, interested in, perhaps, a more long term, and hopefully exclusive, business relationship.
Rhi (as Eisele): You have a very weird idea of “straight to the point.”
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: She scans the rest of you and settles on Phin.
Rhi (as Eisele): What do you all want?
Madge (as Phin): We want contacts. We’re trying to set up an information network, and we figured you guys know the most about what’s going on in this city.
Josie (as Minx): Is that not what I said?
Madge (as Phin): No, you took like 50 minutes to take what it took me like two seconds to say.
Rhi: She nods.
Rhi (as Eisele): Okay. That, I can work with. Are you the ones that, I guess, Kay been talking about who are helping, dealing with those attacks?
Minna (as Myra): That was us.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, that was us.
Rhi (as Eisele): Well, that’s been a great help. We’re grateful for it. But we’re gonna need a bit more if you want us to just share what we know.
Madge (as Phin): Okay. Then what’s the price?
Rhi: She pushes herself up out of her chair, goes over to one of the maps, looks over it a bit, taps one symbol, looks back at the four of you, shakes her head, taps on another one.
Rhi (as Eisele): That could probably work. Y’all seem like, uh … I don’t know, sneaking in places.
Kim (as Blaire): Most of the time, I would say so, yeah.
Rhi (as Eisele): Good enough.
Minna (as Myra): You heard about the night The Grinders and The Billhooks got robbed in one night? That was our crew.
Rhi (as Eisele): Ah. All right. You might be able to pull this off, then. There is an alchemist who’s got a barge. They’ve been using the canals to get around. They’re causing some problems for us. They have been picking up bodies, doing experiments with the corpses, and then with the spirits that come out. And when they’re done, they let the spirits out, and then we have some … I mean, ghosts are already very angry and difficult to deal with, but these are coming out tortured. And we’re the ones that have to put them to rest for good. It’s making our lives more difficult than they need to be. Unfortunately, we don’t have, uh, what you would call the best relationship with The Spirit Wardens. But we also don’t really have the resources to deal with this alchemist ourselves. So …
Kim: Blaire is getting visibly but constrained excited.
Rhi (as Eisele): We think that this alchemist has some kind of arcane means of keeping their barge from being detected by The Spirit Wardens, so what I need you to do is find the barge, remove, break, sabotage, whatever these wards are on it, and then should be enough. I think getting rid of those, The Spirit Wardens will be able to come down on them after that. We may not get along with them, but we have some contacts who can pass on information. So if you can deal with whatever is hiding it, then that will be another problem you’ve dealt with for us, and I think we can do business.
Josie (as Minx): And what are your preferences on if the alchemist is encountered? Shall he be left alone? ‘Cause we can also retrieve him or remove him as needed.
Kim (as Blaire): Kill him…
Minna (as Myra): No. No killing. That makes their problems worse.
Kim (as Blaire): Never mind.
Rhi (as Eisele): Yeah. That’s—
Kim (as Blaire): Sorry.
Rhi (as Eisele): One more spirit we have to chase off the canals. But no, I understand the impulse, and, quite frankly, I think death is probably a little too good for them. Just take down the wards, whatever they are.
Josie (as Minx): Very well.
Rhi (as Eisele): And that’s it. You do that, and between what you’ve already done for us, I think we can come to an arrangement.
Kim (as Blaire): That sounds fair.
Josie (as Minx): It shall be done.
Rhi: You all head back outside.
Josie (as Minx): She wanted to talk to Phin. Phin! Sorry, dear. You are plenty terrifying and all, but one can hardly say you’re the social butterfly of the group. You understand, of course.
Minna (as Myra): Some people prefer an entirely direct approach. You have to keep those people in mind at times.
Josie (as Minx): I thought I was being direct.
Josie: [laughter]
Madge (as Phin): Your version of direct and the working class’s version of direct aren’t exactly the same most of the time.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose that’s true. I should know better than that. But I just thought people in charge preferred discreetness.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know if The Gondoliers really work that way.
Josie (as Minx): Fair enough. The more of us that can talk to them accessibly, the better.
Rhi: As you guys get out to the dock, you see Kay has come back up, and there are now two tarp-covered bodies. Kay is standing there talking to a couple other people. One of them has started painting some sort of symbols onto the tarps.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, what do those mean?
Minna (as Myra): Are there rituals to keep the dead down?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. They’re just … They are keeping their ghost trapped. Well, not trapped, they’re just keeping them with the bodies, you know?
Minna (as Myra): Good. It’s a good thing. I didn’t know they could do that.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah, that’s a thing that can happen. Or you can make do, if you wanted to.
Minna (as Myra): Can you show me how to do that?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, no! Of course not. No!
Minna (as Myra): Why not?
Kim (as Blaire): I … [grumble] Well, all right, let me ask you this: why do you wanna know?
Minna (as Myra): Because it would be useful to know to prevent anything unpleasant happening should somebody die close to us.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. Oh, shit. Okay, I didn’t think about that. In that case, yeah. Yeah, no, when you get back to The Nest later sometime, yeah, I’ll show you.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you. Why would you be opposed to it, Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): Well, I understand the reason why they’re doing this, but it’s not right for someone’s soul to just stay with their shell if it’s, you know, if nothing’s there anymore. I don’t know. I can’t really explain it. Just, it doesn’t feel right to me.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I can’t imagine that tarp is gonna stay there forever. They’re likely being simply relocated.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, yeah, I know. [sigh]
Minna (as Myra): Hopefully they’ll be burned.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi: Kay sees the four of you and comes over.
Rhi (as Kay): We were able to recover them. It’s two less ghosts haunting the canals. Did you have a nice talk?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. [laugh] A nice, very direct, productive business conversation.
Josie: As she says “very direct” she glances over at Phin again. [laugh]
## [00:22:21] gathering information
Madge: Phin’s going over to one of the gondoliers.
Rhi: Yeah. There’s a couple gondoliers who are working on … It looks like they’re resealing the hull of a gondola.
Madge (as Phin): So, they really took that thing apart, huh?
Rhi: One of them glances up.
Rhi (as Gondolier): Yeah, yeah. Gotta, you know, keep up with repairs.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. What if I helped you with that? Would you do me a favor?
Rhi (as Gondolier): You know a lot about boats?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. My parents are fishermen.
Rhi (as Gondolier): Oh, yeah, sure.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Rhi: I think this is gonna be a gather information roll of some kind.
Madge: I did just buy a point in Sway, and I could use that. [laugh]
Rhi: Mhmm. Yeah, you could definitely do that.
Madge: ‘Kay, I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay. You chat with this guy as you’re helping him do repairs on this gondola. As you’re wrapping up, you can ask whatever questions you have about this alchemist.
Madge (as Phin): With this alchemist that’s been messing with you guys recently, I hear—
Rhi (as Gondolier): [grunt]
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. He hangs out on a barge, I heard?
Rhi (as Gondolier): Yeah. Yeah, tends to hang out in places where there’s gonna be corpses. So he’s actually been around in Crow’s Foot a lot, Charhollow, Coalridge, Dunslough; those kinda places, where there’s a lot of bodies to get tossed.
Madge (as Phin): Let me ask you something: would you wanna head over to Crow’s Foot with me later tonight, see if we could suss him out?
Rhi (as Gondolier): Uhh…
Madge (as Phin): And, I mean, I could take you for drinks later. You know, pay for the obvious strain I’m gonna be putting you under, dealing with the alchemist and dead bodies.
Rhi (as Gondolier): The dead bodies, not a problem. The really pissed off ghosts coming off of that barge? A little bit more of a problem.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll take care of them.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. And two drinks and a date, maybe?
Rhi (as Gondolier): You don’t have to offer a date. That’s just a little awkward, but—
Madge (as Phin): Oh, thank goodness, ‘cause that would have been awful. Two rounds of drinks for you and a buddy of yours.
Rhi: There has been another gondolier silently working on the gondola with you guys this whole time who leans around the ship and gives a thumbs up. Yeah. The guy’s like:
Rhi (as Gondolier): Yeah. All right, sure. This is just taking you there. You’re not expecting me to, like…
Madge (as Phin): Pick us up? No.
Rhi (as Gondolier): Okay.
Madge (as Phin): Just drop us there. We’ll take care of it.
Rhi (as Gondolier): Okay, that works. We’ll do that.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Cool.
Rhi: He gives you a dock to meet at later tonight.
Madge: Cool.
Rhi: Yeah. Any other information you guys wanna try to gather? ‘Cause you’ve got most of the day.
Josie: Well, after saying goodbye to Kay and explaining I might be busy the next couple nights but whenever afterwards, I wanna try to find anyone the alchemist might be dealing with.
Kim: Ooh, that’s a good idea.
Josie: I wanna find out what comes out of that barge besides the dead bodies.
Kim: I’ll tag along with that for you.
Rhi: Okay. Who do you want to try to ask about that?
Kim: I might have a suggestion.
Josie: Okay.
Kim: On my list of friends on my character sheet, there is a spirit trafficker named Flint. Maybe he knows something. But the catch is that I don’t like him.
Josie: Mm. Simply providing that information would likely be enough for me to make the contact.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, if you wanna see that asshole, that’s fine with me. Just don’t namedrop me.
Josie (as Minx): I won’t. [laugh]
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: I imagine Blaire walks you over to wherever Flint works out of. Tell me about Flint. How did he and Blaire cross paths?
Kim: Blaire does not like Flint on principle because he deals in selling spirits, and that’s just something that does not vibe with her.
Rhi: Maybe he tried to hire her to capture spirits?
Kim: I like that. I also had the idea that maybe she has stolen from him so she could release spirits into the wild. Maybe both.
Minna: Blaire the spirit ecoterrorist.
Rhi: Blaire will walk Minx over to his little alchemist shop, probably ranting about this guy the whole way.
Kim: Yup.
Josie (as Minx): Okay, so like spirit slavery and trading is a thing, kind of?
Kim (as Blaire): Pretty much, yeah. Yeah, it’s really fucked up!
Josie (as Minx): Oh, dear. You know, I suddenly understand your position a lot more, child.
Rhi: Go ahead and make your roll, and then we’ll see how this goes.
Josie: 4.
Rhi: 4? Okay. You head into this little alchemist shop. It’s very small. You go in the door; there’s about four feet of space, then there’s a counter, and then behind that is a door where, presumably, all of the alchemical goodies are kept. There’s a guy in his early 30s leaning on the counter with his chin in his hand. He’s got a book in front of him that he’s sort of idly paging through. Glances up when you come in, gives you a quick once over.
Rhi (as Flint): Hi. Welcome to Flint’s Alchemy. What can I do for you?
Josie (as Minx): Good afternoon. I find myself in need of fresh reagents, preferably ones that can be easily kept out of the way. I was wondering if you could help me find the particulars.
Rhi (as Flint): Uh, kept out of the way…?
Josie (as Minx): The kind one might need to peek around a bit for.
Rhi (as Flint): Oh, yeah. [sighing] This is your first time, isn’t it?
Rhi: Closes the book.
Rhi (as Flint): Flip that latch around the door for me?
Josie (as Minx): [click]
Rhi (as Flint): Alright. So yeah, what are you looking for? You need devil’s fingers, demon rings? Crow feather’s in stock, if you need those. Crow skulls, too; not too many of those, so those’re gonna be pretty pricey. What are you looking for?
Josie (as Minx): Pardon me for not being more direct. I meant more materials of … of a more transparent variety.
Kim: [snort]
Rhi (as Flint): Oh. Spirits, gotcha.
Rhi: He reaches under the counter and pulls out a thicker book that, as he flips through the pages, looks like a handwritten ledger.
Rhi (as Flint): I’ve got, uh, six right now. Anything in particular you’re looking for?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I don’t suppose any of those are particularly fresh.
Rhi (as Flint): Well, I mean, some of them, if you’re not there right when they come out, it’s hard to know how long they’ve been dead.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, because I’m looking for something a bit more fresh, where the pain centers are still quite stimulated.
Rhi (as Flint): Mm. Don’t think I have anything like that in right now, but I know a guy, another alchemist I do some work with sometimes; goes by Needle. Might be able to hook you up. His place moves around, though. I think he’s been around in Crow’s Foot a lot lately. I would maybe check around there. I know he’s been picking up a lot from the Lamp Blacks and the Red Sashes killing each other all over the place. I mean, it’s been good for all of us in this business.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. That would make sense. Now, regarding the wares you do have in stock …
Rhi (as Flint): Mhmm?
Josie: I’m going to inquire as to the prices of buying a spirit.
Rhi: Oh, buying a spirit? That’s probably gonna cost you one coin.
Kim: Oh my God.
Josie: You know, I’m gonna buy one.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay.
Kim: Minx!
Rhi: Congratulations. You have a ghost in a jar.
Minna: [dismayed cry]
Rhi: You’re down one coin. You have a spirit jar—
Minna: No!
Rhi: And a ghost in a bottle.
Minna: Why did you give him money?
Kim: Blaire is probably listening through the window. She actually didn’t walk away. She’s very distraught.
Josie: All right. Then I’ll politely say goodbye and leave with my wares discreetly. And I meet back with Blaire, and plop the bottle into her hands, and say:
Josie (as Minx): Here, go nuts.
Kim (as Blaire): Wha— But why did you give him money?
Josie (as Minx): Do you honestly believe that I’m gonna let him keep it?
Kim (as Blaire): Should have stolen it from him.
Kim: She puts it in a bag in her pack.
Josie (as Minx): The day will come, I imagine.
Kim (as Blaire): Sure hope so.
Rhi: [utterly failing to contain her glee] Any other info that you guys wanna gather?
Minna: I think that I would like to do some Studying about these wards, if possible.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead and roll Study, and we’ll see what info you get.
Minna: Ah! I got a 6!
Rhi: Okay, cool.
Minna: What she’s looking for is what kind of ward she might find, and, specifically, ways to disable them or get past them.
Rhi: Yeah. The thing that stuck out to you was that it’s not something that’s making the barge impossible to see, because The Gondoliers are able to see it. It’s just that when it’s pointed out to The Spirit Wardens, they can’t seem to locate it, which is kind of strange. You do some research on what little is known about The Spirit Wardens. The Spirit Warden uniform is, they have this navy-blue uniform and gloves and a face-concealing brass mask. You’re able to piece together from various books and pieces of research that the masks have an arcane element to them. Based on what you read about runes and wards, it seems like if you were to use these masks as a basis for some sort of ward, it would make it so anyone who was wearing one of these masks would be unable to see through it.
Minna: Awesome.
## [00:32:34] score begins
Rhi: That evening, as planned, you meet up with Phin’s new gondolier friends, who have been promised drinks in exchange for a ride to the spooky place, the spooky barge. You get on the gondola and set out. Basically, you’re just going through the canals without a specific destination. You’ve been on the canals for maybe 10 minutes, not very long, when you hear gunfire. Not directly in the street above you, but a couple streets over. The gondoliers, based on what you guys had said about this guy being drawn to corpses, start heading slowly in that direction. And sure enough, you guys get over there—
Minna: God, this is horrible.
Rhi: And there’s about three bodies in the canal.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: The bodies are in the canal off to the right. The barge is at the other end of the channel. The gondoliers move up to a point where you guys can get out and move along the edge of the canal to get up to the barge. I think, at this point, we need to establish the score and how you’re getting in.
Josie: I imagine it’s stealth, right?
Minna: Probably stealth.
Josie: Mhmm.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: [singsong voice] Engagement roll! [laugh] I rolled a 1 and a 6.
Minna: Oh, jeez.
Josie and Madge: [nervous laughter]
Rhi: The four of you go creeping down the canal. You’re about three fourths of the way to the barge when you hear a splash. You all freeze up and look over, and see there’s a person in a small rowboat who is rowing over to the bodies. So right now, the alchemist is not on the barge.
Madge: I think our entry point is gonna be on the other side of that building thing from him.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: You guys approach the barge, are able to step onto the barge without too much trouble, and Blaire, you get a prickling sensation up the back of your neck.
Kim: Oh, no.
Rhi: Then, I think, actually, everybody feels a little cold.
Minna: [sharp inhale]
Josie: [nervous noise]
Rhi: There is a ghost about.
Minna: I think Myra keeps the spiritbane charm on a necklace around her neck. She fishes it up out from under her dress and clutches it in her hand, looking around.
Madge: I feel like Phin has hers on constantly, because she does not like ghosts and has a very strong opinion that things that are dead should stay dead.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, they’re trying to.
Madge (as Phin): Not very well.
Rhi: Does somebody wanna take a peek into the ghost field, see what they can see?
Kim: I do. I do, I do! [laughter]
Rhi: [laugh] Blaire jumping up and down, waving her hand.
Kim: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Pick me, pick me!
Kim: Oooh! I got a 6.
Rhi: You put on your spirit mask, you look into the ghost field, and at the opposite corner of the barge from where you guys are, you see it’s a spirit. It looks like it’s probably been a spirit for quite some time, because it has lost a lot of its distinguishing features. At this point, it’s just sort of a humanoid blur, except for one thing that is very crisp and clear, which is the incorporeal sword in its hand.
Kim: Cool.
Rhi: It is floating around the edge of the barge as if it’s on patrol. Yeah. It’s just drifting along.
Kim: She takes her mask off, and she’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, yeah, there’s a ghost with a sword hanging around here.
Minna (as Myra): It doesn’t seem… angry, does it?
Kim (as Blaire): No. He’s just hanging out.
Minna (as Myra): Hm.
Josie (as Minx): Then I suppose it doesn’t need any interaction for now.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] I prefer not to interact with the spirits as much as possible.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. Might as well hide from it, too; get in and out.
Minna (as Myra): Mhmm. We’re looking for a spirit mask, for one of The Spirit Warden’s masks.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): It’s possible the building would be the most likely place for it.
Josie (as Minx): Let’s get in there.
Rhi: You can try the door. It opens.
Josie: [warily] Yay.
Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. This building has been split into a few rooms. You guys step into the first room. This looks like an alchemist’s lab, a very messy one. Arun’s was super neat and organized. This looks like a bomb went off in here. It’s chaos. There’s also, as you all step in, this really unpleasant smell…
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: Like a rotting meat smell.
Various: [noises of displeasure]
Kim: Oh no! No!
Josie: Ugh.
Rhi: It doesn’t seem to be in this room; it’s not that powerful. There are a lot of weird stains on the floor and tables.
Madge: [nervously] What colors are the stains?
Rhi: They’re kind of a brownish color.
Various: [noises of displeasure]
Kim: Great.
Minna: Oh no.
Kim: Great.
Rhi: You’ve got the door you guys came in and another door leading further into this little barge building.
Josie: Is it locked?
Rhi: I don’t know. Have you tried it?
Minna: [nervous laugh]
Josie: Can I try it?
Rhi: Yes. It’s not locked.
Josie: Okay. [laughter]
Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: So, Minx, you’re going first?
Josie: Yeah. Yeah, I suppose I will.
Rhi: You push it open, and the smell gets way worse.
Josie: I shut the door again. [laughter]
Madge: [laughing]
Rhi: [laughs] Without even looking, you just open the door, and then, “Mm! Nope.”
Josie: Yup.
Josie (as Minx): Someone else with a less delicate palate may want to open this one.
Madge (as Phin): I got it.
Josie (as Minx): I’ll remain out here. I am not dragging this stench back to the nest.
Madge: I figure I’m used to at least some level of it. I know it’s gonna be—
Rhi: Of terrible smells, yeah.
Madge: But I know that this is gonna be worse, because human flesh.
Minna: I think Myra does put a sleeve over her face, and she follows.
Rhi: Phin, you open the door. This is the second half of the lab.
## [00:38:57] content warning: detailed description of dead bodies. To skip, go to the next timestamp.
Rhi: There are three tables, two of which have corpses on them. One of the bodies has just been dumped there and doesn’t look like it’s had much done to it. The other one is mid-dissection. There’s a number of jars containing organs and fluids, and, hanging along the ceiling, there’s a lot of bones that look like they’ve been hung to dry.
## [00:39: 32] end of content warning
Rhi: Both of you are gonna take level 1 harm: Nauseated. You can roll Prowess or Resolve, actually, I’ll say, to resist.
Minna: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. So, Myra, you take no stress to just power through this.
Madge: I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay, you take two stress resisting the nausea. There is another door leading onward.
Madge: [fearful croak] Let’s go toward the door.
Minna: Have we had a chance to glance around? Does it look like there’s not really a place that—
Madge: I don’t wanna dig around in the bodies.
Minna: Well, does this ward … I just wanna double check that the spirit mask isn’t in here.
Rhi: Nobody’s really looked for it yet.
Minna: I would like to glance around. I don’t think she’s going to take close looks.
Rhi: Okay. That’ll probably be Survey.
Josie: During all this, I’m just gonna be keeping watch, outside in the other room.
Kim: Okay.
Minna: What the fuck. These dice are magic tonight. I got another 6.
Rhi: You don’t see anything that looks like a Spirit Warden mask in here. You do recognize, though, that several of the jars that are in here are empty spirit jars.
Minna: She’ll tell Blaire later, but I don’t think any of them wanna touch those spirit jars.
Madge: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys haven’t really said anything to us two waiting on the outside, have you?
Minna: No? I think they’re not trying to shout back at you.
Kim: All right. Yeah, I’ll go inside, ‘cause Blaire doesn’t know.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re gonna take level 1 harm: Nausea unless you wanna resist it.
Kim: Fuck harm. I’m gonna resist it.
Rhi: [laughs] That’s gonna be either Resolve or Prowess, whichever one you wanna roll.
Kim: 5.
Rhi: Okay. You take one point of stress, but you push through.
Kim (as Blaire): Augh, that’s nasty.
Minna (as Myra): There’s some spirit jars. I don’t know if you…
Madge (as Phin): If you wanna do your … look at it and see if there’s a trail, or anything, or, you know—
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, I could.
Kim: I put on my spirit mask. Can I roll Attune?
Rhi: Mhmm.
Kim: 3.
Rhi: 3. Okay. You start to focus, but you get the sense that if you push on, you’re gonna see some really horrifying things, so you hesitate. You can try again, but it’ll be risky.
Kim: I wanna try again!
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: [laughs] 6.
Rhi: You look into the ghost field.
Kim: Mhmm. [nervous laughter]
Rhi: You see layers of echoes of the room itself. The bodies that are brought in are washed out, desaturated, but you’re able to see, in these echoes, the spirits that are withdrawn from the bodies are very bright. They stand out. And even through these echoes, you can pick up the remains of their rage and their need for vengeance and their hunger.
Kim: So, they’re certified fresh, then.
Rhi: You’re not just seeing the two bodies that are in here right now, you’re seeing—
Kim: Oh, I’m seeing everyone.
Rhi: Back and back and back and back for a while.
Kim: Oh, cool. Great.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s just layers upon layers of echoes of—
Minna: Wait. Are these spirits also still here?!
Rhi: You don’t know. The one unifying thing is that all of the spirits, after they get drawn into the jars, all of these echoes overlay and move through the next door.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, okay, you guys want the good news or the bad news?
Kim: She takes her spirit mask off.
Madge (as Phin): Bad news.
Kim (as Blaire): The bad news is that there’s a lot of death in this room, a lot of fucked up shit has happened.
Madge (as Phin): Wow, really?
Kim (as Blaire): [sigh] A lot of death. A lot!
Minna (as Myra): We— We get it, and we understand there’s a threat to us in this room, yes?
Kim (as Blaire): Well, no, not necessarily. But… [sigh]
Minna (as Myra): [incredulous chuckle] If it’s pained spirits, if it’s hungry spirits, it’s a threat.
Madge (as Phin): [very quietly] Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): I think I know where we need to go next.
Kim: And she points at the door that the spirits were all drawn towards.
Minna (as Myra): Is that also bad news?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know yet.
Madge (as Phin): It probably is, but let’s go.
Rhi: Minx, are you still hanging out there, keeping watch?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Um…
Josie: I know I’m kind of sitting out, but there was no way Minx is gonna deal with that smell. Just no. [laughter]
Rhi: Oh, yeah. No. That’s fine. Why don’t you go ahead and roll a Survey for me?
Josie: And I get a 3.
Rhi: Okay. You’re pacing around, looking at things, waiting for your companions to come back so you can get out of this horrible place. As you’re pacing, you hear on the side of the barge some splashing and thunking sounds as the boat is coming back.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: I’m gonna start a clock.
Minna: How many parts?
Rhi: Alchemist Discovery; currently, 2 out of 4.
Josie: [groan]
Rhi: You guys have been moving pretty slowly through here. He only had three bodies to pick up.
Josie: Can I lock the door from the inside?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: And I wanna get ready beside it to subdue him if he comes through.
Rhi: Yeah, okay. What are the other three of you doing?
Madge: Going through the door.
Rhi: You open up the next door. Blaire, you immediately can tell what’s going on in this room. Unlike the first two rooms, there’s not really a lot of tables and stuff in here. There’s some shelves in the walls, where there are a number of jars and things, and then on the floor, there’s three large circles that’re made of runes and various symbols. Blaire, you’re able to tell that these are symbols that relate to size, as if something is being stretched or compressed; there are things about containment; there are some that just translate into “knives,” basically, is the closest translation; or “heat” or “cold.” That’s what’s going on here. And then there is another door.
Minna: Is the mask in here anywhere? Can I look for it?
Rhi: You can look, yeah. At this point, it’s gonna be risky.
Minna: I have rolled a 3.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: This is fine.
Rhi: Myra, you’re walking around this room, looking. All of these rooms have been pretty dimly lit, so you have to walk around to peer into corners and look in things. As you’re walking, your boot scuffs some of the symbols on the floor. All three of you suddenly feel very cold.
Madge: Oh. No…
Rhi: You get that feeling on the back of your neck when it feels like somebody’s right behind you, staring at you. You turn around, and that ghost with the sword is standing there.
Madge: Awesome.
Rhi: Myra and Phin, in order to push through just the primal terror that seeing an aggressive ghost instills, you will need to roll Resolve.
Madge: I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: So, what happens if we don’t resist?
Rhi: If you don’t resist, you can tell me how you react: you freeze or you flee.
Minna: See, the thing is, I think this has been building up for Myra, and, at least initially, we’re going to have a freeze reaction.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I’m gonna toss my spiritbane charm at it. [laugh] Like:
Madge (as Phin): Begone!
Madge: [laugh]
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, if you want to assist, you could take a point of stress and help her with this.
Kim: I’ll take a stress.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky.
Madge: 2.
Rhi: Uh, sorry?
Madge: 2! [laughter]
Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: [laugh] Oh my God!
Josie: [groan]
Rhi: Okay, here’s what happens: you throw the spiritbane charm and order it to begone. It does not begone. The charm lands on one of the symbols, and there’s this electric crackling around it. The ghost also doesn’t get any closer, ‘cause whatever is happening with the interaction of the spiritbane charm, the symbol that it’s touching seems to be holding it back for a second. However, you guys can now hear some thuds and thunks from outside, as I’m gonna fill in another tick on the clock of the alchemist getting in.
Josie: How much stress is it to do a flashback?
Rhi: Depends on what you wanna set up.
Josie: I want to have retroactively prepared a disguise.
Rhi: What’s the disguise?
Josie: I wanna have a Bluecoat disguise.
Rhi: I think that’s probably gonna be two stress, ‘cause getting your hands on a Bluecoat uniform is not easy.
Josie: Can I take less stress to have it be less perfect and count on the fact that it’s dark?
Rhi: Yes. One stress gets you just the coat over your regular clothes.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Congratulations. Minx has been wearing a Bluecoat coat this whole time.
Josie: Yeah. I’m actually gonna unlock the door but be ready on the other side with my pistol at the ready.
Rhi: Okay, you’re trying to set up where you could arrest this guy?
Josie: Yes, exactly.
Rhi: Okay. What are you folks in the other room doing?
Kim: I wanna talk to this ghost.
Rhi: What are you gonna try and roll?
Kim: Consort.
Rhi: It’s gonna be risky, lesser effect, because it’s a very angry ghost, and it’s not really inclined to listen to you.
Kim: 4.
Rhi: What do you say to the ghost?
Kim (as Blaire): Hi. My name is Blaire. We don’t mean to intrude. We’re just, um … We’re looking for something. We’re trying to right some wrongs and help some folks out. What’s your name?
Rhi: It was starting to move towards you all again in an aggressive stance. Then Blaire starts talking to it and it slows and turns its head towards her. It doesn’t speak. It has only the faintest impression of facial features. And yet, it is emanating confusion.
Kim and Madge: [nervous laugh]
Rhi: I’m gonna say the consequence is that the alchemist is gonna be coming through the door in a second here, so Minx is gonna have to deal with that.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re not gonna cause you any trouble if you don’t cause us any trouble. We come in peace, and hopefully we will leave in peace. And I hope peace comes to you, as well.
Rhi: Okay. You’re holding its attention.
Kim (as Blaire): Also, I really like your sword. Where did you get it?
Minna: [laughter]
Madge (as Phin): Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Madge (as Phin): No!
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean “no?”
Madge (as Phin): Do not ask a—
Kim (as Blaire): Do you see that, though?! That thing is wicked!
Madge (as Phin): You do not ask a ghost where you got its sword!
Kim (as Blaire): Why not?
Madge (as Phin): Because it’s rude.
Minna: Okay, I would like to make that resistance roll.
Rhi: Yeah, go ahead.
Minna: 4. I got a 4 as my highest.
Rhi: Okay. You’ll take two stress, and you can shake off the fear.
Minna: I’d like to look around for the spirit mask, please.
Rhi: It’s not in this room. You determined that. There’s only one room left.
Minna: Oh, there’s still that other room left. I would like to look in that room.
Rhi: You can walk backwards and open up the door. This is a living space. There’s a bed, piles of clothes everywhere, there’s plates of half-eaten food. Yeah, it’s a very messy space.
Minna: Do you want me to roll that survey?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like there?
Rhi: You are going to have some terrible nightmares. That is probably going to exacerbate your Exhausted condition.
Minna: Yup. 6! Thank God.
Rhi: You step into the room, glance around, and despite the mess, you are able to very quickly spot: nailed to the wall is a Spirit Warden mask that looks like it has been hammered flat and has some kind of rune carved into it.
Minna: I think Myra’s going to grab the mask off the wall and go back into the other room.
Minna (as Myra): Phin, I need you to break this for me.
Madge (as Phin): Awesome. Yes, I’ll do that.
Rhi: Before you do that, I wanna jump over to Minx, because Minx is about to also have a situation.
Josie: Mhmm.
Rhi: You’re squared up at the door, pistol aimed. The door opens and the first thing that comes in is a pushcart loaded with bodies.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Kim: [gasp]
Rhi: There’s three dripping corpses on it.
Kim: [gasp]
Josie: Ugh.
Kim: Gross!
Rhi: Pushing that, straining—‘cause this is three bodies, it’s very heavy—is the alchemist, who is dressed in stained, muddy clothes. The sleeves are wet. Pushes that in, and then looks up and sees you.
Josie: Right as he’s coming in, I’m gonna start advancing on him around the cart with my pistol pointed at him, and say:
Josie (as Minx): On the ground now. This is a raid.
Rhi: Okay. What are you gonna roll?
Josie (as Minx): Can I roll Sway with that?
Rhi: It sounds like Command.
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: What if I spend two stress to make it a Sway?
Rhi: Yeah, for sure.
Josie (as Minx): Critical.
Rhi: You advance on him. He squeaks in terror and flings himself face down on the barge.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: He goes:
Rhi (as Needle): I didn’t kill them! I just found them like this!
Josie (as Minx): You have every right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court. [laughter]
Rhi: [laugh] Great. Good job.
Josie: Okay. I’m just gonna keep him there, facedown, so he doesn’t really get a good look at my face.
Rhi: You guys hear Minx’ muffled yelling from the other room. Phin, you have a sheet of metal with a rune on it.
Madge: Yeah. I’m gonna smash it.
Rhi: Okay. This would be the platonic ideal of Wreck.
Madge: Aaayy! I’m really happy. ‘Kay, I got 5.
Rhi: Okay. How are you breaking it?
Madge: I’m gonna throw it on the ground, I’m gonna take out my pistol, and I’m just gonna shoot it and keep shooting it. [laugh]
Rhi: Okay. I think I’m just gonna say that the ghost is still facing Blaire but kind of halfway looks at you, so your next action is gonna be in a risky position.
Madge: Yup.
Rhi: But yeah, you destroy it.
Madge: [quietly] Woohoo!
Rhi: Blaire, if you keep talking to the ghost, you can hold its attention.
Kim: Okay. That’s good, because I have an idea.
Rhi: Go ahead with what you’re gonna do.
Kim (as Blaire): Hey, so here’s an idea: I’m gonna ask a yes or no question. You nod your head yes for “yes,” shake your head no for “no.” Do you like it here?
Rhi: Shakes its head.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Here’s the thing: I can get you out. If I put you in a jar like… [sigh] I don’t know, by next week I can lead you to The Deathlands and get you out of here.
Rhi: It’s just still looking at you, head cocked to the side, ‘cause [chuckling] that wasn’t a yes or no question.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! No, that’s not a … All right. Let me rephrase that as a question. Would you like me to get you out of here?
Rhi: It nods and then turns again, and drags its sword over one of the circles. The sword doesn’t damage the circle, but sparks fly up around it. The sparks go up and surround the ghost, and it twitches.
Kim: So he has unfinished business with that.
Kim (as Blaire): All right, here’s another question: are you asking me to work with this right here?
Kim: And she gestures to the circle that the ghost is pointing at.
Rhi: It starts to nod, then shakes its head, and then drags the sword through it again.
Kim: All right, can I just investigate? Can I roll something to investigate this sword? ‘Cause I don’t know what it’s asking me.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: All right, I’ll use Attune.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: 6.
Rhi: Awesome. You look into the ghost field. Now that it’s standing close to the circles, you can see there are … Your mind interprets them as chains—they don’t look exactly like chains, but that’s the closest thing that your brain can come up with—twined around the spirit and binding it to two of the circles. From the circle that Myra disturbed, there’s a broken chain stretched out on the floor. It looks at you again, and as it drags the sword, you can see the sword hits the chain, and that’s when the sparks go.
Kim: Oh, okay. All right, I understand now. Blaire’s just gonna get on her hands and knees, and she’s just gonna vigorously rub her sleeve over and totally erase these circles.
Rhi: You’re able to disrupt the symbols enough that the other two chains fall off. The spirit does this shiver, looks at you, Blaire, gives you a single nod, and then just drops down through the bottom of the barge and disappears.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. That’s not what I intended, but okay. That works.
Madge (as Phin): Bye!
Rhi: The ghost is gone.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: The rune is broken. Minx has the alchemist contained.
Madge (as Phin): So, are we going?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Kim: We’re outta here, pretty much.
Madge: Okay. Guy came in a rowboat. We’re talking that, right?
Josie: Yeah, sure.
Kim: I mean, yeah. I don’t see why not.
Madge: Yeah? Okay.
Madge (as Phin): Minx?
Madge: I’m gonna call out.
Josie (as Minx): I’m here.
Madge: Man.
Madge (as Phin): We’re leaving!
Josie: All right. That was easy. Can I pistol whip the guy into unconsciousness?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I have an idea for what we do with him. I think we drop him off at a Bluecoats station with a note as to what he did.
Rhi: The Gondoliers, I think they felt that The Spirit Wardens were better equipped to handle—
Minna: Or, sorry.
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: We can take him to The Spirit Wardens, then.
Josie: I think we should just leave him.
Minna: But he might get back out and do this again, and then that fucks over everybody. Everybody in this city, frankly.
Madge: Yeah. Definitely, this boat needs to get burned.
Kim: Yeah.
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: Then what do we do with our ward, then? Do we take him directly to The Spirit Wardens or to The Gondoliers, or…?
Madge: Do any of us know where The Spirit Wardens actually congregate?
Rhi: Bellweather Crematorium.
Kim: Yeah. Is there a way we can just drop him off on the doorstep like an abandoned child?
Rhi: This could be something you could call in the Cabbies for, ‘cause you do have a positive relationship with them. You could just have them do a drive by and shove him out.
Madge: Hey, Cabbies, we have a corpse we need you to transport.
Minna: Not a corpse!
Madge: Oh, yes. Sorry, forgot we didn’t kill him. [laughter]
Rhi: You just really want to, Phin. I understand.
Madge: I really do!
Rhi: Okay, you’re gonna burn the boat and do a drive by drop off of this guy to The Spirit Wardens?
Kim: Yeah.
Madge: Mhmm. We are 100% burning this boat. I’m sorry if anyone doesn’t agree, but Phin is burning the boat.
Minna: I agree.
Kim: No—
Madge: It’s a bad boat.
Kim: This boats needs to go.
Rhi: Amongst all the various alchemical stuff, you can find things that will let you set this barge on fire. You dump your captive into the rowboat. Who does the honors of lighting it?
Madge: [singsong] Me! I use my lantern. I set the boat on fire.
Rhi: You row away with this guy as the barge goes up in flames behind you. Then, I think, with the Cabbies’ help … They’re a little bit like:
Rhi (as Cabbie): You wanna do what? You know what? We don’t wanna know.
Minna: Do we leave a note? Do we leave a pin? What’s happening here?
Madge: Yes note, no pin.
Kim: Yeah, I vote no pin.
Rhi: Okay. You tuck a note into his pocket explaining what he’s done.
Minna: Keep him off the streets so we can stay on.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that was easy. Does anyone else have time for one more thing to do tonight?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, sleep?
Madge (as Phin): What?
Josie (as Minx): Make some coin out of this. Blaire, you’ll like this one.
Josie: What my end goal here is, is to break into that ghost raider’s place, take our money back, and then rat him out that he’s doing this horrible stuff.
Kim: Blaire almost has stars in her eyes. She’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): Do you really wanna rat him out with me?
Josie (as Minx): Of course.
Kim (as Blaire): All right. Let’s get this fucker!
Madge (as Phin): Is this guy on the way back to The Nest?
Rhi: He’s in the neighborhood.
Josie (as Minx): It’s on the way, even.
Madge (as Phin): Then I’m fine with it.
Rhi: Okay. You are able to break in. He doesn’t really have good security. This is a shitty little alchemist shop.
Minna: Can we steal the cash box? The entire cash box.
Rhi: Yeah. You get three coin.
Josie (as Minx): Honestly, I feel like the rest of you did most of the work, so if you wanna split it between the three of you.
Minna (as Myra): Okay.
Josie (as Minx): I’m in a giving mood.
Josie: Minx ruffles Blaire’s hair.
Kim: Aww, stop.
## [01:00:12] downtime
Rhi: Let’s do downtime. You get Informants!
Josie and Madge: Woohoo!
Rhi: Anytime that you all gather information, you get a bonus die.
## [01:00:21] downtime: Phin
Rhi: Going into downtime actions, Phin, what are you gonna be up to?
Madge: I think the camera goes through the crowd, pulls out, and the fight is already in session. Pretty deep into it; Phin has a black eye, her lip’s been split, and there’s a little bit of blood coming out of her mouth.
Rhi: Who’s she fighting?
Madge: She’s fighting a man about her height but twice as muscular, so it’s pretty unevenly matched. I like the idea of just a final blow coming across Phin’s face, and she gets totally smacked to the floor. She gets up and huffs some of her hair out of her face, spits out a mouthful of blood, and then we see her leave the ring and collect a fistful of cash.
Rhi: Okay. And she feels better about things now, for some reason. That is how Phin is reducing her stress.
## [01:01:20] downtime: Myra
Rhi: Myra, what are you up to?
Minna: Myra has been running herself pretty ragged for the last few weeks. She has not been getting sleep; she’s been choosing work over the amount of sleep she needs to get. She’s been exhausted for a while. I think she gets some breakthroughs when she’s doing her research, so she’s finally feels like:
Minna (as Myra): Okay. Okay, I’ve done enough. I can go sleep.
Minna: And for a little while, it’s pretty restless, because she has these horrible nightmares. You go into her dreams, and there’s whispering in her ear, and she’s calling out:
Minna (as Myra): Mama! Mama!
Minna: And then there’s angry ghosts crowding around her and she’s being forced back into a corner. Then she wakes up gasping. But she gets up for a little bit, and then she finally goes back to sleep. Finally, she’s so exhausted that sleeps just pulls her under and she sleeps for a while.
Rhi: All right. While Myra is sleeping most of the day away…
## [01:02:18] downtime: Minx
Rhi: Minx.
Josie: I think that when Myra does finally wake up, she sees the sculpture outside her door.
Minna: I think Myra opens her door, and there’s a statue right outside it, and she screams. [laughter]
Josie: [laughing] Yeah. It’s not a full size. It’s on like a small table. But it’s as big as someone’s torso, and is kind of just—
Madge: It’s big enough.
Various: [laughter]
Rhi: What does the sculpture look like?
Josie: You know, a marble sculpture of a woman pouring out a pot of water or something, and gently draped with a cloth, or something like that. Something just really simple and classical like that, but it’s, for some reason, right in front of Myra’s door. [laugh] Minx placed it somewhere super prominent in the center room, maybe even on the table, or something, and then either Phin or Blaire just sort of—
Minna: [whispering] God.
Josie: Gently nudged it over there. Now it just becomes a thing. No one ever sees anyone else move it. If you come back to The Nest, it’s probably gonna be in a different spot.
Minna: Do they give her a name?
Rhi: Oh, God. They have to! What do you guys name her? Minx can’t be the one to name her.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: It has to be something where Minx is angry about the name that the rest of you have given her.
Josie: Yeah. It’s some very long, foreign language name that sounds super froufrou, but y’all should give it a dorky nickname.
Madge: Kevin.
Kim: Kevin.
Minna: [giggling uncontrollably in the background]
Josie: I don’t know. I like Kevin. [laugh]
Minna: Yup. It’s Kevin.
Josie: The statue’s name is Kevin.
Madge: Yes.
Rhi: Perfect. I’m glad we’ve come to this decision.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: [laugh] Okay.
## [01:03:54] downtime: Blaire
Rhi: And Blaire.
Kim: This is the night after the score. Blaire is alone in her room. It’s pitch black, except for the many, many candles, which she has going around. She is poring over her books, trying to find out what she can about ghost swords. She probably doesn’t hit any breakthroughs or leads or anything, but she is just poring and poring over tons of these encyclopedias and tomes. She just wants to know about that freaking sword, man, and that’s her indulging her vice, is all this ghostly sword research. She falls asleep with dreams of swords in her head.
Rhi: Aww.
## [01:04:32]
Rhi: We see the four of you come up to The Gondoliers’ headquarters again. Eisele is actually outside talking with a couple other people. As she sees you, she comes over and gives you a broad, toothy grin, and is like:
Rhi (as Eisele): Well, you didn’t exactly follow the letter of my request, but I sure appreciate the spirit with which you carried it out. We’ve heard that the alchemist has been detained for questioning by The Spirit Wardens. It’s very rare that people come back from that, so…
Josie (as Minx): Are you all really gonna let that spirit joke go by? Okay, never mind.
Rhi: She smirks at Minx and seems pleased that somebody got it.
Kim and Madge: [laughter]
Rhi (as Eisele): Yeah, as agreed, if you need information about any of your work, you can reach out to any of my people and we’ll tell you what we can.
Josie (as Minx): It’s been a pleasure.
Madge (as Phin): Mhmm.
Rhi: We end with her shaking hands with Phin.

Rhi: [laughing] Oh my God, I’m just picturing one day, Minx—
Josie: And Minx is like:
Josie (as Minx): Y’all are such children.
Rhi: No, ‘cause Minx comes back one day and goes into her room, and stretches, and then looks in her bed. And the statue is neatly tucked into it.
Josie (as Minx): Heavens!
Everyone: [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Who would dare? Who?
Josie: She comes out and is like:
Josie (as Minx): Who— Who would dare? Who would dare treat fine art in this fashion?
Madge (as Phin): I have no idea. I didn’t see a thing."

Transcript created by Tyler.
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. Episode 7! I still can’t believe how much of an audience we have only seven episodes in. thank you so much for listening, and if you haven’t yet please consider leaving us a review. It’s a great way to help new listeners find the show.
This month’s featured charity is Masjid al’Rabia, a Chicago-based mosque for queer, trans, women, and marginalized Muslims who may feel out of place in both mainstream Muslim communities and queer communities. Masjid al’Rabia is centered on five pillars of inclusivity: women-centered, anti-racist, LGBTQIA+ affirming, pluralist, and accessible. Their programming includes weekly prayer services, a free library, a family arts program, and prison outreach initiatives. If you have a few dollars to spare consider making a donation. A link to their site is in the show notes.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## [0:01:03]
Rhi: It’s a couple days after your last score where you recruited The Gondoliers to basically act as an information network for you. What are you all up to? You’ve kind of finished your downtime stuff. You’re starting to think about your next score. What’s everyone doing?
Minna: Myra has come face-to-face once more with the statue.
[giggling]
Josie (as Minx): Say hi to Kevin.
Minna (as Myra): I still can’t believe you named it Kevin.
Josie (as Minx): You all named it Kevin.
Minna (as Myra): Tch, that’s what I mean. It was a collective you.
Kim (as Blaire): We didn’t name it Kevin. Its name IS Kevin. See?
Kim: She points, and Kevin is clearly written somewhere, like probably painted on the base.
Josie: No. Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare deface it.
Kim: It’s already there.
Rhi: [giggling] There’s a sign.
Kim: Oh, okay, that’s better. Yeah, I agree. There’s a sign that just says Kevin.
Josie (as Minx): Ugh. Yes, the grand masterwork of my collection, Kevin. Ugh.
Rhi: While you guys are kind of hanging around The Nest, brainstorming ideas for your next score… Minx.
Josie: Hi!
Rhi: You are in the common area returning your statue to its rightful place of honor in the center of the table, and you set the statue down, kind of shift a little bit to line it up, and step back to look at it, and a ghost rises up through the statue.
[gasping]
Josie (as Minx): Are you this Kevin they’re talking about?
Rhi: The ghost tilts her head to the side slightly, and says:
Rhi (as Ghost): The Dimmer Sisters have a message for you.
Josie: Very well…
Rhi: Do you remember who The Dimmer Sisters are?
Josie: [whispered] I don’t. I don’t remember.
Madge: They’re an ally of ours.
Rhi: Yes. They are one of your allies. They gave you maps to underground passages and things throughout the city, and it was basically like we will give you this stuff with the expectation that you will do us a favor in the future.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose this is about the returning of a favor?
Rhi (as Ghost): Please report to their townhome in Crow’s Foot as soon as possible.
Josie (as Minx): [nervously] Very well. Thank you for, heh, delivering this message… You can leave now, though, probably.
Rhi: It kind of nods its head, and then sinks back into the statue and through the floor.
Josie (as Minx): [deep breath] Hey Blaire…! Actually, everyone. Everyone get in here.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah? What’s up?
Josie (as Minx): Um, uh, so there was just a, ahem, a ghost came in here.
Kim (as Blaire): What?!
Josie (as Minx): Sent by The Dimmer Sisters? They want us to meet with them?
Madge (as Phin): Okay. That’s better than I thought it was gonna be when you first said there was a ghost. I thought it was gonna be time to move.
Kim (as Blaire): Why didn’t you come get me?!
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, I’d be lying if I’m saying my heart is settled. I’m talking just to stave it off. This is not gonna do wonders for my wrinkles. I mean, I don’t believe I’m old enough to get wrinkles yet, but this will give me wrinkles.
Minna: Do we know about The Sisters’ trade?
Rhi: I was gonna say—Yes. So, I’m sort of wondering what everyone’s opinion on The Dimmer Sisters is, because I feel like there might be some of you, possibly all of you, who aren’t terribly fond of them. The Dimmer Sisters are spirit traffickers. They are trying to consolidate the market. They want to have a complete monopoly on it in the city. So, they deal in a lot of ghosts and other such things, like a lot of their home security is bound spirits. The other fun thing about them is that no one actually ever sees The Sisters themselves. They are recluses who stay in their townhouse and deal with everyone through intermediaries.
Josie: Blast. I was about to suspect that I believe we should return the favor with murder.
Rhi: I mean, you could try.
Kim (as Blaire): [quietly] Can we?
Josie (as Minx): Like, no one would object to this one, right?
Madge (as Phin): As much as I don’t like them, it’s better that we leave them where they are and just do what they want until we’re actually, you know, we’re actually somebodies in this town.
Josie (as Minx): True. Although, I would like to think I’m at least a somebody by this point. [snickering] How in blazes did we get Blaire to agree to this deal again? I don’t recall.
Madge (as Phin): She wasn’t there.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh… you guys.
Josie (as Minx): Right. We didn’t.
Minna: What if it was while the group was still forming up?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Because didn’t Myra and Phin kind of start it?
Madge: Yeah. It definitely feels like it was a Myra and Phin thing.
Minna: So, I think Myra stances they’re a valuable connection that we worked hard to court.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): [quietly] They’re still assholes…
Madge (as Phin): If you want, you can just stay behind.
Kim (as Blaire): No! No. Maybe there will be a spirit on the way that I can set free. So, there.
Minna (as Myra): I hear your discomfort, Blaire. I don’t know what we can do to make this less uncomfortable for you.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s okay.
Rhi: So you guys gonna head on over that way?
Madge: Yep.
Rhi: You all head out of The Nest and start making your way over to Crow’s Foot, and to get there you sort of cut up through The Docks. As you’re heading through The Docks, you notice something kind of strange. There’s a crowd of people, not a big crowd but maybe 12-15 people, kind of gathered at the edge of the docks looking out into the bay.
Madge: I’m gonna head over.
Rhi: There’s probably a couple people there who sort of recognize you and nod.
Madge: I’ll nod back and sort of use that influence to get closer to the front.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. They’ll let you up. There’s an older woman up there. You recognize her. She’s just one of the many dockhands who’s been working here for probably her entire life. She’s standing up towards the front with a spyglass held up looking out.
Madge: I’m gonna look up at her.
Madge (as Phin): What’s going on?
Rhi (as Dockhand): There’s a cargo ship that they think somebody, I’m not sure if it was The Bluecoats or The Spirit Wardens, stopped it just inside the lightning barrier and they’re not letting it come into dock.
Madge (as Phin): Ah. So, what can you see?
Rhi (as Dockhand): It looks like it might be Iruvian.
Madge (as Phin): Huh…
Rhi: Yeah. So, Phin, here’s what you know about cargo ships. They’re not super common anymore. With the spread of the rail lines across the empire a majority of shipping between the different parts of the empire happens via train. Cargo ships are not really common. If somebody’s using a cargo ship it tends to mean that they wanted to have things come directly from, in this case, Iruvia to Duskwall without having to deal with any of the stops throughout the continent of Akoros in-between. Sometimes people do that because they’re worried about security. There are thefts along the train lines from time to time, or they’ll do it because they don’t want to have to deal with their cargo going through customs at multiple points.
The other thing is that because cargo ships are less common now they are expensive, so it tends to be only people with money who can afford to put stuff on them. So, there’s probably something valuable on there.
Madge: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Josie: Hopefully our meeting leads to us being on that ship.
Madge: I mean, I don’t really see the connection.
Madge (as Phin): Hey. Can I get that spyglass from you for just a tick?
Rhi (as Dockhand): Sure.
Rhi: She hands it over, but she is watching you closely.
Madge: Yeah. I’ll hop up to stand right next to her and look out.
Rhi: Anything in particular you’re looking for on it?
Madge: I wanna see if I can find anything that’s directly related to either The Bluecoats or The Spirit Wardens to see which group is the one that’s actually doing the stopping.
Rhi: Oh, okay. We’ll treat this as a gather information roll, so I’d say do either Survey or Study.
Madge: And I get a +1 towards that, right?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Madge: Six!
Rhi: Nice. Okay. You kind of scan over the ship and don’t really see anything, and then as you sort of lower the spyglass and look over the harbor you see a smaller boat coming back towards the dock that has the symbol of The Spirit Wardens painted on the prow.
Kim: [long exhale]
Madge: Okay, so maybe our visit does have something to do with The Spirit Wardens.
Madge (as Phin): Thanks for letting me borrow this.
Madge: I hand the spyglass back over.
Rhi (as Dockhand): Yeah, no problem.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. If anything else happens can you fill me in on it? I’m living over in Six Towers.
Rhi (as Dockhand): Yeah sure, although I will say if you’re interested in learning more about the ship in an up-close fashion—
Rhi: She winks at you.
Rhi (as Dockhand): –you’re probably gonna wanna move fast. A target like that, pretty juicy.
Rhi: She kinda puts her spyglass back up and goes back to looking at the ship.
Madge: Okay, then I’m gonna go and head back over.
Madge (as Phin): Okay. I think it’s time we start moving. It might be more important that we get to The Dimmer Sisters than we thought.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, so, that ship was stopped by Spirit Wardens, and the only reason a ship is even coming in here in the first place is if someone is rich and someone doesn’t want someone to know what’s on that ship.
Josie (as Minx): Sounds perfect.
Madge: So, yeah. We keep going.
Rhi: Okay. You head over towards where The Dimmer Sisters live. Like I said, they have a big townhouse in Crow’s Foot. From the outside it’s kind of dilapidated and surrounded by a very tall, wrought iron fence with some visible spark-craft security measures on it. The house itself, all of the windows have thick curtains covering them or they’re shuttered, and the front door has a really thick chain wrapped around the front handles that looks like it’s padlocked in place.
Madge: I’m gonna pick up a rock and throw it at the fence.
Rhi: The rock arcs gracefully through the air, goes into the gap between two of the fence posts, and arcs of electricity fry out and blacken it and it skitters off.
Madge: So, I get a little closer, not so that I’m actually touching the gate or anything, but I’m gonna look through the gaps and I’m gonna go:
Madge (as Phin): If any of the spirits are listening, it’s Phin. We’re here to see The Dimmer Sisters. Myra’s here too.
Rhi: There’s not a response, immediately. About a minute or so passes, then coming around the side of the house is a young woman. It looks like she’s from The Dagger Isles, has darker skin, dark hair that’s tied up into a braid around her head, wearing fairly plain, simple clothing. Phin and Myra, you recognize this as Rosalyn. She is one of the very few human servants who work for The Dimmer Sisters, and she’s the person who you’ve met with previously. She comes up to the gate, takes a large keyring off of her belt, unlocks a few things, opens the gate just wide enough for her to slip through, closes the gate behind her, locks it back up, returns the keys, keeps a hand on the keys… as she looks the four of you over.
Madge: [giggles]
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Oh, good, you got our message. As our messenger said, we did a favor for you, so it is time that you do a favor for us.
Madge (as Phin): And we’re here and ready to listen. If you wanna actually spill those precious details out in the middle of the street, you know, you’re free to do that, but I’m guessing this is something that is better discussed behind closed doors.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): You’re going to have to try much harder than that to get into the house, my dear.
Madge (as Phin): Can we at least go inside the gate?
Rhi: She kind of considers it for a moment, and sighs.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Very well.
Rhi: Reaches back, unlocks everything again, opens the gate, and like a lot of the finer houses here there’s not really a yard, there’s just these big paving stones, and inside kind of running from the gate to the front door is a black stone path. She just says:
Rhi (as Rosalyn): You may enter, but if you stray from the path I cannot be held responsible for what becomes of you.
Madge (as Phin): Yep. Certain death. Got it.
Rhi: You guys all come inside, and she shuts the gate. She turns to you all and says:
Rhi (as Rosalyn): There is a cargo ship from Iruvia that has been stopped in the harbor, and there is one item on the ship that we would rather not fall into the hands of The Spirit Wardens. We would like you to get onto the ship, locate our item, and return it to us. Anything you would like to help yourself to while you’re on the ship, feel free to do so, and if you find any items of particular arcane or occult interest we may be willing to buy them off of you.
Madge (as Phin): What exactly is the item that we need to be looking for? I know that you said it was ‘an item,’ but unless you want us to steal everything…
Rhi (as Rosalyn): A dagger, that we need for some of our rituals. It will be in a simple wooden box marked with my name. it will likely be in one of the secure vaults.
Madge (as Phin): Great. Yep. Secured ships, secured vaults, sounds like a walk in the park for us.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Good. If you do this for us then we will be at an even accord.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. When is the ship expected to leave or unload?
Rhi (as Rosalyn): We do not know.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. That was the whole thing about it being stopped back there. They weren’t letting it in or out.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): I would suggest you move quickly, though, as The Spirit Wardens will likely want to secure it.
Minna (as Myra): We’ll probably have to get there before it reaches The Docks.
Josie (as Minx): It should be a simple matter to take care of it this evening.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Very well. When you obtain the item simply return to the gate and I will collect it.
Madge (as Phin): Okay.
Rhi: She nods, and swings the gate open again.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Let’s get going.
Rhi: Yeah. So, she click-click-click, locks it up behind you guys. What do you wanna do?
Josie (as Minx): Phin, can you get us a boat?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, I can get a boat. My family are fishermen.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that’s why I asked you. We just need to make sure we have the capability to get into a vault, otherwise I don’t think there’s much planning to do here.
Madge (as Phin): We use some of our demolition tools to [destroying noise].
Kim (as Blaire): Ooh. Oh, but there’s probably a lot of spirits onboard. I mean, they’ll be fine. They’re non-corporeal.
Madge: They’re already dead!
Rhi: Yeah. Explosives are not gonna bother the ghosts.
Josie: It’s a matter of not blowing ourselves up.
Rhi: So, you guys just gonna head straight back to The Docks?
Josie: Yeah, let’s do it.
Kim & Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. So, Phin, are you just gonna borrow your family’s boat or are you gonna see if you can get a boat from somebody else?
Madge: I’m gonna look into getting another boat, because my family is out on the water right now, probably.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m gonna say this will be another gather information. Whatever skill you want to use, you’re basically going to be at improved effect, because these are your people. Even if you roll a 1 you will still get standard effect.
Madge: Well, I did get a 1, so…
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. You’re at increased effect, so… You ask around. It takes a little bit of time to find someone who’s gonna be willing to loan you a boat, but you are able to talk to somebody who has basically a good sized row boat. When you come up it’s like:
Rhi (as Loaner): Yeah, I’ve had five other people ask me to borrow my boat today, but you, I know I can trust you.
Rhi: And he kinda like punches your shoulder.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. I’m a trustworthy girl. It’ll be back in one piece. I swear on my life.
Rhi (as Loaner): See. This is why, you, I will loan my boat. All those others, they would not treat it with respect.
Rhi: You have secured yourselves a ride out to the ship. What kind of plan are you guys thinking this is?
Josie: I imagine Stealth. Yes?
Minna: Yes.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: So, you guys are doing a Stealth plan. I’m gonna say that the engagement roll is 2d6. Okay. This is the second time in a row that I have rolled a 1 and a 6. So, you guys are gonna be starting off in a controlled position.
## [0:18:54]
Rhi: We see you guys rowing across the bay. The ship is silhouetted against the lightning barrier as you guys get closer and closer. You get to the side of the ship. Phin, as you are securing it there, you kind of glance back and you can just make out back towards the docks there’s a couple other small boats that look like they’re heading in your direction, but they’re pretty far off. Unless someone circled around to the other side of the ship it looks like you guys are, for right now, the only outside group here.
Madge (as Phin): We’re gonna have to go quick.
Josie (as Minx): Yep. Let’s just get below decks.
Rhi: Yep, so you guys climb onboard. The top deck of the ship at least is quiet and deserted.
Madge: Do we see a staircase or anything heading down?
Rhi: Yeah. There are stairs that’ll lead down further. Are you guys trying to be sneaky or are you going for speed over stealth?
Kim: I know this is time sensitive, but I think we should be sneaky about this.
Josie & Minna: Yeah.
Madge: Phin is running on the tips of her toes. [laughter] Tink, tink, tink.
Minna: Do we wanna do a group Prowl check?
Josie: I have no stress. I can lead.
Rhi: So, everyone roll Prowl. This is still gonna be controlled.
Minna: I got a 4.
Madge: One.
Kim: Three.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: That 5 is the result that we’re gonna go with, and there was a 1 and a 3, so Minx you’re gonna take 2 stress.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: You guys sneak downstairs as quickly as you can, and as you’re going the ship rolls a little bit and some of you stumble and bump into some stuff. It makes a little bit of noise. Nobody is on you yet, but you kind of hear some murmuring voices down the hall.
Kim: Oh boy.
Rhi: So, this is the crew quarters. Basically you guys have come down into a long hallway with a bunch of doors on it, and it makes sharp turns at either end. There’s basically just a hallway that probably circles the whole ship and a bunch of rooms in the middle, and there is another staircase leading further down.
Josie: I think we go further down. Yes?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. You are now down on the lower level of the ship, the lowest deck. It’s basically a big open space, for the most part, that is full of crates and boxes and barrels latched in place, and then at the far end of the cargo hold there are what look like two large rooms that are closed off.
Kim: Are they locked?
Rhi: I don’t know. You’d have to go over and look.
Kim: I go over and look. [giggling]
Madge: Yeah. I’ll take the one that isn’t being looked at, then.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire and Phin lead the way over to investigate, and these look like they might be the vaults that you were looking for.
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Their walls are made of metal here, and there’s some very stout looking doors. The doors are also made of metal and have a pretty complex lock mechanism on them.
Josie: Shall we try to break the lock before we resort to demolition supplies?
Rhi: Blaire, are you gonna try to pick one of the locks?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: All right. Left door or right door?
Kim: Ooh. One tells the truth and one tells lies. Um…
Josie: Heh. You have one question.
Kim: Right door.
Rhi: So, it’s gonna be risky, you guys are Tier I… This is gonna be limited effect.
Kim: And it’s Tinker, right?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Oh no. I got a 1.
Rhi: Okay. You start on the lock, and work at it a little bit, and then the ship rolls again and your hands slip. You hit something. You kind of fall backwards just as some kind of alarm bell starts ringing.
Kim: Oh boy.
Josie: Eek.
Rhi: You guys can hear from overhead some muffled shouting and movement.
Josie: Is there anywhere to hide near the stairs?
Rhi: Yeah. There’s tons of hiding places around here. There’s all sorts of boxes and stuff you can hide behind.
Josie: All right. I think I am once again gonna hide myself near the entrance to ambush people who come down.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Can I blow up the safe now?
Rhi: Yeah. This is gonna be, if you’re using—I assume you’re gonna wreck it?
Madge: Yeah. I’m using demolition tools for wrecking.
Minna: I’d like to guard Phin.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, what are you gonna do?
Kim: I think ‘m gonna watch an exit and keep an eye out, make sure nobody comes down here.
Madge: I’m gonna roll these one at a time because it’s making me nervous.
Rhi: [laughs]
Madge: Okay. The first one’s a 1.
Minna: Oh no.
Madge: Oh, but the second one was a 2. Ah, the third one was a 1, too.
Kim: [long whine] Nooo…
Josie: Oh God. No… Oh…
Rhi: What?! Oh my gosh. Madge! How—How do your dice do this to you? I am flabbergasted.
Madge: I don’t know…
Rhi: So, I think what happens, Phin, you set the charges but the timing is off and you’re not as far away as you should be when it blows.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, you basically just get blown backwards, and I think you’re gonna take level 2 harm—
Madge: More shrapnel?!
Rhi: Uh, I mean—It’s shrapnel. There’s some burns. I think for shorthand you can just call it Exploded. Basically anything physical now you’re gonna be at -1 die unless you wanna resist.
Madge: No, I’ll take it.
Rhi: Okay. So, yeah. Phin just gets blown backwards. There is now a hole in the vault. It’s not like the door just got neatly blown open, though. It’s gonna take a little doing for somebody to climb in there.
Minna: I think Myra chases after Phin.
Minna (as Myra): Are you okay?!
Madge (as Phin): [coughs] Yeah. I’m cool. Is it open?
Minna (as Myra): Uh, sort of.
Madge (as Phin): Ugh. Okay, cool. Am I bleeding? I feel like I’m bleeding.
Rhi: [whispered] She’s bleeding a lot.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah…
Madge (as Phin): Great.
Minna: I think Myra’s pressing whatever cloth she can find to the wounds, even if that means it’s her skirt.
Rhi: Aw. So, Blaire. You’re gonna scramble on in there?
Kim: Yeah. I’m in the vault.
Rhi: You are actually gonna have to roll Prowl to get in there, because it’s very narrow and there’s a lot of jagged metal, and in order to get in there without getting hurt…
Kim: Great. I have nothing in Prowl. Let’s see how this goes.
Rhi: You can push yourself to get a die.
Kim: Uh, I don’t feel like we’re that desperate yet. I feel like things can get worse. I shouldn’t jinx ourselves like that. [laughs]
Madge: I just got blown across the room! Just—
Kim: All right! All right! I’ll push myself!
Rhi: Does somebody wanna help and give her a second die?
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna glance between Phin and Blaire.
Kim: No. Take care of Phin. Take care of Phin. She’s bleeding.
Madge: No, help the kid up.
Minna: I think she’s glancing between and assessing these two situations.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, can you do that on your own?
Kim (as Blaire): I got it! I got it!
Madge (as Phin): Please, please, help her. More important that we’re not in debt to The Dimmer Sisters.
Minna (as Myra): It’s important that you don’t die on us, too, but—
Madge (as Phin): I’m not gonna die!
Kim: I’m just gonna roll! I’m just gonna roll! Four.
Rhi: Okay. You manage to wedge yourself in the side. Your shirt catches on some metal and it tears a little bit, but you don’t actually get cut. However, everybody hears now from upstairs the running and shouting has taken on a different tone. There’s more of it now, and you’re starting to hear gunshots.
Josie: Haha. They’re fighting the other guys.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. There are now other people on the ship. Blaire, yeah, you managed to crawl into the vault.
Kim: Okay. Good.
Rhi: There are lots of boxes, fairly well organized, but you will have to spend a little time searching around to find it, because basically she said it’s a plain wooden box with her name on it. There’s a lot of plain wooden boxes in here, so you’re gonna have to do some looking. I’m also gonna have to clarify the complication from her roll, I’m starting a clock that is Rival Gang Reaches the Cargo Hold. It is currently 1 out of 4. That’s what is happening currently. Blaire is in the vault, or one of the vaults. The box you’re looking for might not be in here. That’s also a possibility. You’re not sure.
Madge: I’m gonna crawl my way over to the other one.
[groans and laughter]
Rhi: You didn’t take level 3 harm to where it would be—Yeah. You can walk.
Madge: Okay. So then, I’m getting up and I’m walking over to the other one. I’m gonna try blowing it up again.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear. Are you sure you don’t want Myra or someone to handle this one?
Madge (as Phin): Minx, Minx, Minx… Shut up.
Josie (as Minx): My word.
Minna (as Myra): I trust your expertise.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky, standard effect, and I don’t think that your getting blown up is gonna have a negative impact on this. I feel like you’ll get your full dice.
Madge: Since it’s not that physical, it’s me placing charges and…
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah.
Madge: Oh! Thank goodness. I got two 5s and a 4.
Rhi: Okay. You’re able to set the charges safely this time, but it takes you more time. Because of that extra time, I’m filling in another tick on the clock, but this time it is picture perfect, the door just goes flying into the vault.
Madge (as Phin): Ah, thank spirits. Okay. I’m gonna start looking in here.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, if you wanna try searching your vault you can roll to do that, however you wanna do it, you can let me know.
Kim: Definitely. I think it would be Survey, right?
Rhi: It depends on how you wanna do it. You could do Survey, you could do Study, you could even make an argument for Attune.
Kim: Ooh, ooh, I have 2 in Study. I will use that instead. Oh, all right, 4.
Rhi: Okay. Again, I think it’s a similar sort of thing. You find the box with Rosalyn’s name on it, but it takes you a while.
Kim: Okay. Great.
Rhi: So we’re at 3 out of 4. Do you wanna grab anything else while you’re in there?
Kim: Yes. I’ll just grab what I can carry.
Rhi: Yeah, so you get the box you need and just start grabbing whatever looks—This looks like an interesting sized box!
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: While you’re doing that, Myra and Phin. You two are searching the other vault. Doing this as a group?
Minna: We can do that. How are you doing for stress, Madge?
Madge: I’m fine.
Minna: I’m also good on stress. Whoever, anyone can lead.
Madge: I’ll take the stress then.
Minna: Okay.
Madge: Yeah, so I’ll be doing Survey and then taking the lower of the two, so that’s a 2.
Minna: Three. Great, heh, sorry.
Rhi: So Phin, you take two points of stress. I’m just gonna fill in the last tick on that clock. So, three out of the four of you are in some vaults, and Minx as the one who’s outside. You see a couple people start to come down.
Josie: Who are they?
Rhi: Minx, you recognize one of them.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: It’s not Bazso.
Josie: Damn it. [laughs]
Rhi: The guy who’s sort of leading the way down the stairs, it takes you a second, but you recognize he is the guard that you spoke with outside The Centuralia Club when you guys were scouting it out.
Josie: Huh… Ooh.
Rhi: Followed by a pair of women, one of them has a crossbow slung over her back.
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: The other has just a lot of daggers on her belt and on a bandolier, and a lot of scars on her arms and her face.
Josie: Okay. I think what I’m gonna do is pop up from my hiding spot and use my unusual weapon, that is to say a bolas, and try to knock them off their feet and entangle them.
Rhi: The first guy, in the lead?
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: And this would count for my level 2 harm, yes?
Rhi: This is definitely doing something physical. What are you rolling for this attack?
Josie: Um, Skirmish?
Rhi: Yeah. That makes sense.
Josie: Do I wanna go up to 2? I think I do. I think I’m just gonna push myself. Six, and the other one’s a 1.
Rhi: Okay. So, yeah, you chuck the bolas, they twine around his legs, and he goes ass over tea kettle down the stairs.
STEVEN: Nice.
Rhi: He’s not unconscious, but he is bruised up and tangled up, and is gonna have to spend some time disentangling himself before he can kind of reenter the fray. Now, the thing is, because you stood up and did that, the two women have a clear line of sight on you.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: The rest of you probably heard a yell and a [thunking].
Josie: I think I am gonna call out, somewhat casually.
Josie (as Minx): I do believe it’s time for us to leave now.
Kim (as Blaire): I’ve got the box. We can go. We can bail.
Minna (as Myra): Oh good.
Madge (as Phin): Oh, then what are we over here for?
Minna (as Myra): Let’s get out of here. Are you good?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. [grunts]
Rhi: Myra and Phin, are you guys gonna grab anything in your vault?
Madge: I’m grabbing three boxes and just carrying them.
Minna: Yeah, I’ll do that as well, then.
Rhi: Okay, and I think Blaire I’m gonna say you have two boxes that aren’t the thing you actually came here for.
Kim: All right. That’s fair.
Rhi: Yeah. So, you guys have a total of eight boxes of mysteries and excitement.
Josie: Woo.
Kim: Yay. Christmas.
Madge: Yay.
Rhi: [giggles] Yeah, so you guys come out of the vaults. Actually, Blaire, you’re probably gonna need to make another Prowl to avoid harm.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: If you’re okay with taking some harm as you scramble out, you can just make it out without doing a roll.
Kim: No. Fuck harm. I’m tired of it. Uh, ha ha, ha, 1.
Rhi: Okay. Cool. Let me think here… Oh, I know what I’ll do.
Kim: I don’t like that.
Rhi: Uh-huh.
Josie: [giggles]
Kim: I don’t like that GM statement.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. So, I am filling in 1 tick on a mystery.
Kim: Ah!
Rhi: Something is happening in the background that you guys aren’t aware of yet.
Kim: [nervous noises]
Rhi: Blaire basically has to take a little bit of extra time, because you’ve got all those boxes in your arms it’s harder to climb out, so it takes you longer to get out of the vault.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Myra and Phin, you are able to walk out, because you have a nice doorway.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: There’s two people on the stairs. One of the women looks like she’s drawing daggers, the other is moving to unsling her crossbow from off her back. That’s the situation you guys have in front of you. Everybody’s out of the vaults now, everybody’s got their loot, and you’ve got at the moment two people blocking your escape.
Madge: I’m gonna drop my boxes, and one of my things is throwing knives.
Rhi: Uh-huh.
Madge: Can I actually switch from throwing knives to a gun, because I realize that most of the damage is in my chest, so winding back to throw a knife might not be the best idea.
Rhi: Oh, yeah, for sure, you can.
Madge: [laughs] So, I’ll switch that for a pistol.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. So you’re gonna use a pistol. Who would you like to shoot at, dagger lady or crossbow lady?
Madge: Crossbow lady. Two.
Rhi: You fire the shot, she ducks, and it misses, and I’m gonna fill in another tick on our mystery clock.
Madge: Dang it!
Rhi: Right after the shot fires there’s a loud slam from the upper deck.
Kim: [deep inhale]
Madge (as Phin): I did not do that, I swear.
Rhi: The two women both kind of look up at the sound of that thud and seem a little startled.
Minna: I think while they’re distracted I’m going to try and take a shot as well. It’s going to be a Hunt.
Rhi: Which one are you shooting at?
Minna: I’m going to also shoot at crossbow lady. God damn it, they’re both 2s.
Kim: Ugh.
Rhi: Wow.
Madge: Why do we suck?!
Rhi: So, you shoot, and she dodges again, and this time has managed to unsling her crossbow and fires back at you. You’re gonna take level 2 harm as a crossbow bolt hits you in the thigh.
Minna: I would like to resist this.
Rhi: Yeah, so you’ll resist with Prowess.
Minna: Four.
Rhi: Okay, 4. You’ll take 2 stress. You also manage to sort of twist out of the way and instead of it hitting square in the thigh it kind of cuts a gash along the side, so you’re at level 1 harm.
Minna: Crossbow Grazed Thigh.
Rhi: Minx, you wanna try and do something?
Josie: Yeah. I’m gonna have a blunderbuss. [laughs] I’m gonna blast them.
Rhi: Oh, you’re gonna try to hit them both with one shot?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. What are you gonna roll to do that?
Josie: Can I roll Skirmish since it’s close range?
Rhi: Yeah, I’ll allow it.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: It’s gonna be risky.
Josie: Okay. [whispered] That’s a 1.
Rhi: Oh my God, you guys.
[groans and sighs]
Kim: I yearn for death.
Rhi: Let’s see here…
Josie: It sucks, because I’m still out of pocket sand.
Rhi: Yep. Your gun jams. Basically, you’ve burned 2 load on something that isn’t gonna help.
Josie: Damn it.
Rhi: You lose the opportunity to shoot. You go to fire, and just [click], it locks up.
Josie: God fucking—Ugh!
Kim: This is the worst.
Madge: Can I take another shot at crossbow girl?
Rhi: By all means.
Madge: I got a 5.
Rhi: Five, okay. You hit her.
Madge: Woo. I’m aiming for the shoulder.
Rhi: Okay. You hit her in the shoulder and she kind of staggers down the stairs a few steps. Given that four shots have just come at the two of them in rapid succession, the woman with the daggers grabs her and they both move down the stairs. At first they were like ah-ha, we have the high ground, and then they’re like oh crap, we’re really obvious targets up here. Yeah, really the only thing I can do there is I’m gonna fill in another tick on the mystery clock.
Madge: Great.
Rhi: Who else wants to do something?
Minna: I think that I would like to also continue shooting at people who are coming at us?
Rhi: That works.
Minna: How’s crossbow lady doing?
Rhi: Bleeding heavily from the shoulder.
Minna: Okay. I’ll go for dagger lady. I’m going to roll my hunt once more.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: So, what I’m trying to do is make her stumble, so I’m kind of more shooting at her feet. I rolled a 2.
Rhi: What’s going to happen is, you take that shot, the woman with the crossbow fires at you again, and this time it’s going to be just level 1 harm because she’s not able to get as good aim on you.
Minna: Eh, can I resist that too?
Rhi: You can, yeah. I think this time it’s gonna be a graze on your arm.
Minna: Uh, 2d6, please, please, please. Why? Why, though?!
Rhi: What’d you get?
Minna: I got a 2!
Josie: [groans]
Rhi: So, that’s gonna be 4 stress to resist it.
Kim: Lord.
Minna: It was that or level 2 harm, so.
Rhi: Well, it was level 1 harm.
Minna: Yes, but I have two level 1 harms.
Rhi: Oh!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: What’s your stress at right now, Myra?
Minna: One away from a trauma. Please help me.
Kim: I can help. I have stress to spare.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire, what do you wanna do?
Kim: Is there a way I can move in front of Phin and take a shot at one of these two people?
Rhi: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Kim: Like, be a shield and attack at the same time?
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, you can do that.
Kim: I wanna shoot at knife person.
Rhi: What are you gonna roll?
Kim: I’m trying to decide what weapon I have on me. Can I fight knives with knives? Can I have some throwing knives? I’m gonna do that.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. You get her with your throwing knives. There is a consequence.
Kim: Maybe I dropped a box that I was carrying, one of the mystery ones.
Rhi: I’m fine with that being the complication, but it’s both of the extra boxes.
Kim: Okay. I’m doing it for friendship. I lost my boxes.
Josie: After those two coming down the stairs, and that there’s some kind of commotion going on upstairs, Minx calls out that she’s gonna make sure the way ahead is clear. I’m just gonna have all my weapons at the ready and start gallantly, but slightly limpingly, get up the stairs and smoothly start working my way down through the hallway to get back to the boat.
Rhi: Okay. Minx is off securing your escape. The three of them aren’t looking great. The three of you are looking pretty banged up, too.
Madge: I was just gonna ask Myra what her harm is looking like.
Minna: Two level 1 harm, I have all of my stress boxes marked except one.
Madge: In that case, would you be okay if I like picked up Myra and started carrying her up the stairs?
Minna: Aw, God bless.
Kim: Aw.
Minna: Yes.
Madge: Do I have to roll for that at all?
Rhi: I think it’s, yeah, in order to get around the three of them you’re gonna need to roll probably Prowl. It’s gonna be risky. You could do it as a group action. Blaire, if you wanted to run with them—
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Well, I was gonna say, Blaire, how are you doing on stress?
Kim: I’m good. I only have 2 stress right now.
Rhi: There we go. You wanna lead that group action, Blaire?
Kim: Yeah. I can do that.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: So, Phin has the bright idea?
Madge: Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): No. You’re hurt. You shouldn’t.
Madge (as Phin): I’m fine. I have been totally worse than this before. I mean, I got shot before, and this is better. You can keep a lookout for both of us.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi: The two of you go limping towards the stairs leaning on each other. Blaire, you were sort of in front of them to shield them. Are you still kind of leading the way like that?
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: So yeah, everybody go ahead and roll Prowl, and Blaire is leading this.
Madge: [relieved] I got a 6.
Rhi: Good.
Kim: I got a 3.
Rhi: But, Phin got a 6, so Blaire you’re gonna take 1 point of stress.
Kim: I can do that.
Rhi: How do you make it past them without getting hurt?
Minna: Use the boxes as shields.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. I think that one of the boxes that Myra is carrying, a throwing knife just sticks in the top of it as you’re running, but you guys make it up the stairs to the mid deck, kind of do a quick glance around, don’t see anything, make it up to the top deck. There’s a couple bodies up here, some blood stains on the deck, you’re guessing they’re probably some of the crew. As you guys get up onto the top deck you suddenly hear screaming from the decks below, but you guys make it back over to where the boat is, Minx is standing there like waving you down. You’re a little slower climbing back down, this time you’re a little banged up, but you guys make it into the boat and start slowly rowing your way back towards the dock.
Kim: Oh, thank God.
Rhi: You’re probably a good 50-60 feet from the ship, and something makes you glance back, and you see just standing at the railing, staring at you, not making any sort of movement, there’s a humanoid figure, but even though there is basically no light out here there’s still this sort of weird glow in its eyes.
Minna: Mmmmm!
Kim: Can I put on my spirit mask and look at it?
Rhi: Yes. I’ll let you, and I won’t have you make a roll, because it can’t get to you.
Kim: All right. I wanna squint at this mother fucker.
Rhi: So, when you look at different things in the ghost field they appear sort of in different ways: humans tend to be a little de-saturated and washed out, ghosts tend to show up more brightly in the ghost field, obviously.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: This feels like you just looked straight at a spotlight.
Kim: Oh!
Rhi: It’s real bright. Like, you look at it, and then rip your spirit mask off almost immediately because it’s too bright.
Kim: Is that thing a demon?
Rhi: No, that’s not quite what demons look like in the ghost field.
Kim: Is it a poltergeist?
Rhi: Nope. You’re not quite sure what it is.
Kim: What the fuck…
Rhi: So, you guys make it back to The Docks.
Madge: I’m gonna return the boat to the guy.
Rhi: It’s in good shape. The boat’s fine.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: What I’m picturing is like you guys come up to the dock, the guy’s just kind of hanging out there, reading the paper, looks up, does a double take at you, because you guys all look like hell, and is just like:
Rhi (as Loaner): What happened out there? Are you all right?
Madge (as Phin): Heh, yeah. We’re fine.
Minna (as Myra): [weakly] No…
Madge (as Phin): Okay, we’re not that fine. We got it, though. We know a physicker, so. Thank you for letting us use your boat.
Rhi: He kind of leans over to look at the boat to see how it is.
Rhi (as Loaner): Thanks. Like I said, I knew you were trustworthy with it. You should really probably go see that physicker of yours now.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Haigs keep their word.
Rhi: All right. You guys head off. I assume you guys are gonna kind of lick your wounds before going back to The Dimmer Sisters.
Kim: Uh…
Minna & Madge: Yes.
Kim: All right, yeah.
Madge: [laughs] I would like to not be dying.
Rhi: Yeah. So, let’s shift over into downtime.
## Downtime [0:44:16]
Rhi: Two of the boxes contain… One of them contains some occult reagents, like stuff you would use in making arcane essences, that sort of thing.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: The other one contains another spirit mask.
Minna: Mmm!
Rhi: It’s another fine spirit mask. For all of that stuff, if you wanna sell it to The Dimmer Sisters in addition to your dagger, they will give you guys a total of 6 coin. So, the last box, it’s a small wooden box with a pretty simple lock, and it has the name Avrathi. Any of you can very easily pop the lock and open it up. Inside it’s lined with worn, dusty velvet upon which rests a small crystal sphere that’s a few inches across. It’s a clear crystal, but there’s something inside it.
Minna: Can we see?
Rhi: If you pick it up and take a look at it.
Minna: Uh, can I do it without picking it up?
Kim: I’ll do it. I’ll pick it up.
Minna: [nervously] Okay.
Rhi: Blaire, you pick it up and turn it over, and inside the crystal is a single human eye.
Kim: [gasps] Like a real–?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Oh boy. Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): This definitely is a scrying thing. It has to be.
Rhi: It’s bloodshot, it has a pale blue iris, and it’s twitching a little bit. It’s looking around.
Kim (as Blaire): What the fuck? What the fuck?!
Kim: Blaire almost drops it as soon as she knows that it’s twitching, and then she like gathers her grip again an very carefully puts it back.
Rhi: Yeah. You have that.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispered] I kinda wanna keep it.
Rhi: You don’t know what it is, but Blaire you could tell just by holding it that this is something very powerful.
Kim (as Blaire): You guys, this thing is really spooky and I kinda wanna keep it.
Madge (as Phin): That sounds like a really bad idea.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm! Mmm!
Minna (as Myra): In your opinion, can The Dimmer Sisters be trusted with it?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t think they can be trusted with anything, but… it’s really cool.
Minna (as Myra): We aren’t obligated to sell anything.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s true.
Madge (as Phin): Okay. It’s an eye. [laughs] Ground rules, if we keep it…
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm?
Madge (as Phin): It stays in a separate room.
Kim (as Blaire): Stays in my room.
Madge (as Phin): You get five minutes with it a day.
Kim (as Blaire): Wha-?
Madge (as Phin): What if it possesses you?
Kim (as Blaire): It won’t possess me.
Madge (as Phin): You can’t say that for sure.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes I can. I have, I use protection.
Madge (as Phin): Blaire. Blaire!
[laughter]
Minna: And we all become middle school children.
Rhi: Phew. Bring it back. Bring it back. All right.
Kim: Phew.
Kim (as Blaire): Ten minutes. Ten minutes a day.
Madge (as Phin): Ten minutes a day. Fine. Deal.
Kim (as Blaire): Deal.
Kim: She shakes on it.
Madge: Yeah, shakes.
Rhi: Okay. So, for downtime activities what does everybody get up to after the score? Blaire, let’s start with you.
Kim: So, Blaire is alone in her room, and I imagine that she’s locked the door. She’s gonna take her 10 minutes of the day with her, I mean, until I figure out what the fuck this thing is I’m calling it a scrying crystal. She is going to take it out of its box, and hold it up again, and look under it, and just look at the eye again.
Rhi: Basically it’s a similar thing as before. The eye kind of twitches as it looks around, and then as you’re holding it, it meets your eyes.
Madge: Agh, gah, I don’t like this.
Rhi: You have this understanding, just somehow, that this thing wants to be used. It wants to be able to see.
Madge: Ahhh!
Kim: Can I put on my spirit mask to look at it?
Madge: Oh my gosh…
Rhi: Yes you can.
Kim: [musically] I wanna look at the secrets.
Rhi: So, you put on your spirit mask and look at it through the ghost field. It weirdly doesn’t look that different. It looks basically, the crystal is a little harder to see, but the eye itself is just kind of glowing a bit, and it looks kind of like it’s floating above your hand because the crystal is almost invisible. You can also see that there are sort of these tendrils of spirit energy that are wrapped around your hand and up your arm, and based on the angle, you can’t really see, but it seems like they’re going up your face.
Kim: Okay.
Madge: Cool! Ugh.
Kim: Um, Blaire is gonna take her mask off, and very slowly put it back in the box.
Rhi: All right!
Kim (as Blaire): [huffs] I was going to name you, but now I’m not so sure. So, I’m gonna put you away for now.
Kim: And she just slides it under her bed.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay. All right. So, that’s been Blaire’s fun and exciting time.
Kim: [musically] Having a good time. Having a good time.
[laughter]
Rhi: All right. Myra.
Minna: Myra has just finished a long term project. She has been hitting the books about this blood-iron ring, and what has she discovered, Rhi?
Rhi: Well, previously, she had learned about kind of the rumored origins of the blood-iron ring, that it was made by a sorcerer who crafted it from the iron drawn out of the blood of a single sacrificed human, and that it seemed to have some kind of connection to vampires, and that it apparently also had some connections to, like, cannibalism.
Kim: Oh boy.
Rhi: So, you are able to do some digging, trying to figure out what this thing is, what it does, and you find in this thin, dusty book that is on the wrong shelf, you find some notes about this ring. Vampires have a lot of very powerful abilities, but one of them is something that is referred to in this book as Arcane Sight which theorizes that it allows vampires to hear people’s thoughts, to see in total blackness, see invisible things, sense the locations of objects, you know this very powerful arcane sense that emanates out from them. This ring reportedly will grant you that same ability for a short time, but in order to activate it you have to, it says, quote, wash the ring in living blood.
Kim: Oh, joyous.
Rhi: And, there’s a description of the ring in here, that it is a plain, hammered, iron ring that is pitted with pockmarks all over the surface, but when it’s exposed to blood the ring seems to soak it up and it becomes solid and smooth for the duration of the Arcane Sight. You’re reading this and taking notes, and you sort of get to the end of this book’s description, and you flip the book shut, but as you do there’s the notes in the front of like who has checked it out recently and it falls open on that page. The cover doesn’t quite shut. You glance at it. It’s only been checked out from the library a handful of times, but the most recent is within the last six months, and the name that’s written here is the initial P. Avrathi.
Minna: Mm. Hmm!
Rhi: So, that is something else that you have learned about the ring and where, well, you don’t know where it might be, but you know the last person who was researching this before you.
Minna: Well, I would like to bring that info back to the others at some point.
Rhi: Yeah, for sure.
Madge: That would be a good idea.
Rhi: You’ve got that. And, Phin.
Madge: Since I think the most good came out of Phin actually going to the physicker, I think it would be cool to do that.
Rhi: Okay. The three of you have been sitting in the waiting room. This was like, you guys went here straight after the score. You were sitting in the waiting room because Sawtooth had somebody else that he was patching up, and the three of you had been looking at this eye, and you hear the door to his office open, you close the box real quick, and a woman comes out with her arm in a sling, a black eye… Phin, she looks vaguely familiar, you think maybe you’ve seen her in a bar, at The Docks, or something.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: And yeah, Sawtooth kind of looks at the three of you, focuses in on Phin, and then just throws his hands in the air and then points into his office.
Madge: Yeah, and then she goes in and sort of plops down on the table, or bed, whatever is being used, and is like:
Madge (as Phin): Hey. What’s up?
Rhi (as Sawtooth): [sighs] Do I even wanna know what happened?
Rhi: He’s getting his tools together.
Madge (as Phin): Um, so…
Madge: And she’s like rolling up her shirt at this point so he can get to all the shrapnel and junk.
Madge (as Phin): So, you know that boat that’s been stalled out by the lightning field?
Rhi (as Sawtooth): No.
Madge (as Phin): Oh, okay. Well, there’s a giant cargo boat that’s stalled by the lightning field, and The Dimmer Sisters had a thing on there, and we decided that, well we didn’t decide, we were tasked with going and getting an object for them…
Rhi: As you’re talking he’s starting to like pull shrapnel out.
Madge (as Phin): After we got there we figured out that there was—Dude, can you not like, warn me first?
Rhi (as Sawtooth): No. if I warn you you’ll tense up. It’ll hurt worse.
Madge (as Phin): [groans] This is the worst. Okay.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): Maybe don’t get riddled with shrapnel next time.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I didn’t mean to. I was trying to blow up the door and it didn’t work.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): [sighs]
Madge (as Phin): The second time I blew up the door it worked.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): Congratulations. I’m very happy for you. Is the blowing up how this happened?
Madge (as Phin): Yes.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): [sighs]
Rhi: He keeps pulling out shrapnel.
Madge (as Phin): It’s more interesting, right?
Rhi (as Sawtooth): I mean, technically. Yes.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. It’s not getting shot. That’s cool.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): [sighs]
Rhi: He finishes with the shrapnel and goes to get some ointment for the burns. He just like hands you a whole little pot of it and is like:
Rhi (as Sawtooth): Put this on all of the burns twice a day for the next…
Rhi: He kind of looks you over.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): …five days.
Madge (as Phin): Five days? If I don’t, will I get a cool scar?
Rhi (as Sawtooth): It depends on if you think burn scars look cool, or more likely it’ll get horribly infected…
Madge (as Phin): Oh, I hate infections.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): …and then you’ll get sick, and you’ll die.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I had shrapnel in my arm, and it got infected and I didn’t die.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): No. I said that the shrapnel in your arm could get infected. It didn’t somehow.
Madge (as Phin): Oh. Nice.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): But having multiple open burn wounds—
Madge (as Phin): What if I keep it closed but don’t put the stuff on it? I don’t wanna rub stuff on me. It’s weird.
Rhi: He slaps a hand over his eyes.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): If you keep them covered, yeah, that’ll help avoid infection, but they’re gonna take a lot longer to heal.
Madge (as Phin): Fine. I’ll rub the stupid junk on it.
Rhi: He just shakes his head at you.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): Just go, and it would be really nice if I went a week without seeing you.
Madge (as Phin): But, I’m so much fun.
Rhi (as Sawtooth): Egh…
Rhi: He opens the door.
Madge: [giggles] She leaves.
Rhi: All right. What does Minx get up to on her downtime?
Josie: She spent some time indulging her luxury vice, which this time instead of an art binge is going to be “scoping out” The Centuralia Club which is mostly gonna consist of her hanging out in disguise and coming at it from various angles but not really taking in useful information, just sort of people watching and sighing wistfully at the façade, and getting up to very long daydreams of what it must be like to just be able to go in there and not worry about money and just spew coins everywhere.
Rhi: So, you’re standing there staring, and are startled very rudely out of your daydream when a hand falls on your shoulder.
Josie: Uh-oh. I jolt out of my daydream and turn around.
Josie (as Minx): How rude.
Rhi: Yeah. You look up to see a very, very tall, muscular man who is wearing a somewhat ill-fitting guard uniform. It seems that they didn’t make one in a size appropriate for him. He’s standing there staring down at you, and he just kind of peers at your face.
Josie (as Minx): Can I help you, good sir?
Rhi (as man): You look like somebody we might be looking for. What’s your name?
Josie (as Minx): Lady Katya. I don’t believe I have been to this establishment before. I was observing the grounds, but…
Rhi (as Man): No. I think you’ve been here before. I think you were talking to Stephan, and now Stephan’s dead.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that’s unfortunate and I’m sorry to hear it, but I’m afraid I don’t know a Stephan. So, before this line of inquiry gets uncomfortable…
Rhi: He starts to reach out like he’s gonna grab your arm to presumably haul you off.
Josie: Eh, I’m just gonna calmly try to leave.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re able to like back up to dodge his grab, and then I think you have to make a very hasty exit, but this is basically your overindulging giving the crew an additional 2 heat…
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: …because some of the guards recognized you. They’re like, wait a second.
Josie: Blast my distinctively beautiful face. [laughs] Can I actually insert like a little flashback as I’m fleeing, sort of?
Rhi: Absolutely.
Josie: We just sort of get a really quick flashback to a little over a decade ago, because it’s Minx and two other people and she’s still a young girl though not everyone saw it that way at the time. There’s a slightly taller dark haired boy and a dark haired girl about her age all in shaggy garb who have apparently just filched something from a noble rolling up to the club and are now beating feet hard across the cobblestones to get away from those very much older, very much scary looking guards.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so Minx just has that little flash of the last time she was in this situation, but she makes it around the corner and gets away.
Josie: Mm-hmm. [laughs]
## [0:59:45]
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Do we wanna end with you guys making the delivery to The Dimmer Sisters?
Madge: Yeah.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Sounds good.
Rhi: Okay. So, you guys head back over there with a few of the boxes, and this time it seems like your appearance was expected. As you’re kind of coming up along the fence you see Rosalyn come out and she meets you at the gate.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Did you get it?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Madge: And I’ll hand over the box.
Rhi: She takes her keyring off her belt, flips to a particular key, unlocks it, opens it, and you can see there is indeed a dagger inside, but it has some kind of like, it’s attached to some kind of complicated looking machinery on like the hilt. There’s some wires and stuff coming off, some runes carved into things, it’s weird looking. She just opens it, nods, closes it, locks it again.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Well done. I thank you for this. This will be a great help to us.
Rhi: She tucks the box under her arm, and notices that you guys have a couple other boxes.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Did you find anything else that you thought that we may find interesting?
Madge (as Phin): No, we just carried these around for fun.
Minna (as Myra): I think Myra gives her a look.
[laughter]
Rhi: Rosalyn also gives her a look, and then very pointedly turns to look at Myra.
Minna (as Myra): We found some components and a spirit mask.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispered] Some of us do carry around those things for fun.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, but she wasn’t being very nice to our friend here.
Rhi: So, she takes the boxes from Myra and opens them up, looks, and nods to herself.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Right. Very well. Here.
Rhi: She hands the boxes back.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Wait here. I’ll return with payment for these.
Rhi: She goes back inside, comes back without the box with the dagger that you’d given her, but she is carrying a small leather satchel. She holds that out while also holding out her hand for the other two boxes.
Minna: We make the exchange.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): We appreciate this, and hope that perhaps we can continue to do business in the future.
Kim (as Blaire): Eh…
Minna (as Myra): I hope that this has seen to our debt for now.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Rhi (as Rosalyn): Yes. The debt between us is settled.
Minna (as Myra): I’m glad.
Rhi: She takes the two boxes and shuts the gate.

Now, then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## [00:01:04] story resumes
Rhi: It has been a couple days since your score that you did on the cargo ship for The Dimmer Sisters, which ended up being fairly profitable, if also somewhat creepy, with some mysteries lurking out there—one of them in the form of an eyeball.
Kim: [creepy laugh]
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: And now, for today, the four of you are in The Nest. You’ve all come together for dinner, we’ll say. What’re you guys up to as you’re all grabbing food?
Josie: First of all, we’re setting the scene. Where’s Kevin?
Minna: I think he’s at the table.
Kim: Yes, Kevin has a seat.
Josie: Excellent.
Kim: Okay, but is there a plate of food for him?
Minna: No. We can’t waste food.
Josie: [laughter]
Madge: That’s a shame.
Rhi: Someday. That’s the goal.
Kim: Blaire is reading a book while she eats.
Madge: Phin has both her feet up on the table.
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Dear, I know it’s not the cleanest of tables to begin with, but would you mind not mussing it up further?
Madge (as Phin): It’s not on your food, is it?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, no, but it might be at some future point.
Madge (as Phin): Then I’ll keep my feet up. It’s fine.
Josie (as Minx): Uh, well, it’s less a matter of getting in the food and just keeping it clean. I do try to tidy this up sometimes, at least when it’s my turn.
Kim (as Blaire): Jeez, just let her live.
Madge (as Phin): I’m living my truth.
Multiple: [laughter]
Josie: I thought all of you would be on my side on this one.
Rhi: Myra, what are you up to while this is going on?
Minna: I’m honestly just watching it like a tennis match at this point.
Josie and Rhi: [laughter]
Josie: Also, what do Phin’s boots look like?
Kim: Oh, God.
Madge: They are the sturdiest of sturdy work boots. They’re basically ones that the dockworkers wear. They’re definitely dirty, ‘cause she also wears them to the fight pits.
Josie: Are they in good condition, though, aside from being dirty, or are they super worn?
Madge: Eh.
Josie: Eh.
Madge: They’re all right.
Josie (as Minx): Dear, it’s hard to stand in the way of practicality, but if you ever need those to last longer, I’m certain I could rustle up a contact to help you with that. Not that I don’t think you can’t take care of your own shoes, but I do have a few ideas to spruce them up.
Madge (as Phin): Well, these are the boots my mom gave me, and I don’t really wanna “improve” them. I think they’re fine.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, well. Far be it for me to mess with a gift.
Minna (as Myra): Taking care of your leather items can make them last longer.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but weathering them makes them look cool.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. [laughs]
Madge (as Phin): Of course. Aesthetics are important.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah!
Josie (as Minx): Blast. I’ve been beaten at my own game here.
Everyone: [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): My sense for aesthetic has been turned around back on me.
Minna: I think as Myra said that, she definitely shot a look at Minx. [laughter]
Josie: [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Curse you, Myra.
Rhi: As you guys are chatting and ribbing Minx about her priorities, you guys all notice the temperature suddenly drops in the room.
Kim: Nice.
Josie and Minna: [dismayed noise]
Madge (as Phin): This is the worst.
Josie (as Minx): Have we suddenly sprung a draft, or…?
Kim (as Blaire): No, I think it’s a friend!
Madge (as Phin): No.
Josie (as Minx): No.
Madge (as Phin): No, not a friend.
Josie (as Minx): This isn’t the best way for a friend to come visit.
Kim (as Blaire): Why not?
Minna (as Myra): We should not have ghosts in our home.
Josie (as Minx): It’s impolite.
Kim (as Blaire): How is it impolite?
Minna (as Myra): Because I don’t want ghosts in my home.
Josie (as Minx): At least to come unannounced.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah, okay, that we can agree. They should, you know, introduce themselves first.
Minna (as Myra): I would prefer that you gave me warning so I can not be here when you have ghosts visiting.
Madge (as Phin): Same.
Rhi: Blaire, you didn’t exactly invite the ghosts over. This was not—
Kim: Oh, this is not one of my friends. Okay. It’s a stranger.
Rhi: Yeah. You don’t know what ghosts these are; nobody’s looked.
Minna: Can I Attune? [laughter]
Josie: I am not going to.
Kim: Gimme a looksees.
Rhi: Blaire and Myra are both looking?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: You both look into the ghost field, and, wow! That’s a lot more ghosts than you were expecting.
Kim: Yo!
Rhi: There’s about five ghosts in the room drifting in the general direction of your table. Among them is the ghost with the sword from the barge. They specifically seem to be moving towards Blaire. You’re not sure why they’re here, Blaire, but you know that ghosts need to feed on life essence by possessing people and devouring their souls.
Kim: Mhmm. Go on.
Rhi: Just saying.
Minna: You can’t see, but I’m pinching the bridge of my nose because I am Myra. [laughing] Way to go.
Kim: [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. There’s a bunch of ghosts hanging out in here. What do you all wanna do about it?
Kim: I should probably talk to it and try to settle this. It’s probably some kind of misunderstanding.
Rhi: Okay. [sigh]
Josie: But it is your forte.
Minna: I would like to leave? [laughter]
Multiple: [laughter]
Rhi: Do you tell any of the others what you see?
Minna: I think Myra puts her hands on the table and stands up abruptly.
Minna (as Myra): That’s a lot of ghosts. I’m going to leave. Blaire, can you deal with this on your own?
Kim (as Blaire): You got it.
Minna (as Myra): By “deal with this,” to be clear, I don’t want ghosts in my living space. They are not staying.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, yeah. No, no, they’re not staying.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): Unless they get into jars. I don’t know. But yeah, no, I’ll take care of this.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Minna: And Myra turns to leave.
Madge: Can I leave too?
Josie: Yeah. If Myra has deemed this unsafe, I do believe I shall be exiting as well.
Kim: Oh my God, you guys! Don’t leave me alone with them!
Minna: Myra feels very unsafe around ghosts.
Rhi: The other three hastily head down the stairs.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: Blaire.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: You’ve got a whole crowd of ghosts that are moving in. They’re not surrounding you, but they’ve made a half circle around you. The one with the sword is standing right in front of you. What do you want to do here?
Kim: Blaire’s just gonna look up at this guy.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi! You found my home. What’s up? Cool.
Multiple: [quietly cracking up]
Kim: That’s all I can think of. [laughter]
Josie: [laughing] Yeah.
Rhi: The ghost that you were talking to, the lead one, tilts its head to the side, and levels the sword at your throat.
Josie and Kim: [gasp]
Rhi: Not touching, but pointed it at you. You just get from all sides, all of these ghosts, this overwhelming feeling of hunger.
Kim: Oh, no. Okay, okay. Blaire’s just gonna put her hands up. She’s gonna take this a little bit more seriously now.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Let’s see if we can try to level with each other here, all right? What do you want, and how can I help you with that that doesn’t involve the cost of my life? Can we compromise here? Can we level?
Rhi: The ghost with the sword doesn’t respond, ‘cause it’s not able to speak. One of the other ghosts—female figure, can’t really make out a lot of the features, but there’s still more of a face there—she says:
Rhi (as Ghost): You freed us from the torturer, but now we hunger.
Kim (as Blaire): I can help you get to a place where there’s more food than just me and my friends. I do this kind of stuff. I free ghosts. I can help you guys!
Rhi (as Ghost): Where?
Kim (as Blaire): Deathlands. I can get you out of there.
Rhi (as Ghost): How?
Kim (as Blaire): You would have to trust me, but I can take you there.
Rhi: And again, there’s a:
Rhi (as Ghost): How?
Kim (as Blaire): I would probably have to put you all in jars, which I know would really suck. But it would make things easier for me—
Rhi: The ghosts flare up and—
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, no, no, no! No! It’s—
Rhi: The plates of food slide around and a couple things crash to the floor.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, jeez. Minx is gonna kill me.
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Kevin is unmoved.
Josie: Well, that’s good. At least Kevin is safe.
Kim (as Blaire): I know that jars really suck. I kinda hate them too. I don’t think that they’re very nice. I can only imagine how uncomfortable they are, but I promise, you wouldn’t be there longer than a day. I would be able to carry all of you out very easily. I would let you out and you can roam free for the rest of your immortal days, just feasting on whatever the hell lives out there.
Rhi: Give me a Consort or a Sway.
Kim: Oh, no, absolutely Consort. All right, I have 1 in Consort. Aww… 3.
Rhi: The ghosts don’t really go away, and the one who had been speaking just says:
Rhi (as Ghost): There is plenty to eat in this city.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Can I just ask, as your freedom-giver, liberator person, that you don’t eat me or my friends? You can wreak havoc anywhere else in the city, and if I run into any of you guys again, I’ll leave you alone. But just, you know, so we’re even, one debt to another?
Rhi: There’s another long pause while they seem to be considering it. Then the ghost with the sword lowers it and gives a nod. They all drift back out through the wall.
Kim: Oh, that was close.
Josie and Minna: [relieved sigh]
Madge: What a thrill.
Rhi: While Blaire is off negotiating with some ghosts, what do the three of you do once you get out of The Nest?
Madge: I’m still in front of The Nest. I’m pacing. [laughter]
Minna: That works. I like that.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Minx actually wants to try to distract from the tension by talking to Myra a little bit.
Minna: Oh.
Josie (as Minx): This might not be the most appropriate time, but I don’t think I ever did properly thank you for talking to Bazso. I don’t think me going would have been the appropriate time, but I do appreciate that you opened communications, as it were, and I will be talking soon.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, of course.
Josie (as Minx): Although, on that note and old acquaintances, had you and Nyryx met before? You seemed to get in a bit of a bad way when we visited.
Minna (as Myra): Uh, she thought she knew things about me. I had not met her before, no.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Well, indeed, she does have a bit of an insightful eye. I can imagine her assuming something in that fashion.
Minna: I think Myra tilts her head and looks at Minx, wondering if she knows that Nyryx is possessed by a ghost.
Josie: Minx does not, so… [laughter]
Rhi: Minx does not.
Minna (as Myra): Your friend has secrets.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I must assume so, especially given her trade. Confidentiality is utmost in her line of work, I imagine.
Minna (as Myra): Just be careful around her. I think she should be safe, but I’m not quite sure.
Josie (as Minx): Well, thank you. I do look after her in what ways I can, though past experience has led me to believe that she should be more careful around me, to be honest.
Josie (as Minx) and Minna (as Myra): [laughter]
Rhi: I think that’s a good time for Blaire to come bounding out to let you guys know that all is well, although dinner is kind of all over the floor now.
Kim (as Blaire): Everything’s under control. I took care of it. It’s fine. It’s all good. Don’t go in there.
Josie (as Minx): Glad to hear it. [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): They all left.
Madge (as Phin): [suspicious noises]
Josie (as Minx): They all left, and they’re not coming back?
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Josie (as Minx): Uh, all right.
Kim (as Blaire): At least, they won’t be bothering us if we ever seen them again. Can’t say for the rest of the city, but, you know.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose, better elsewheres than here.
Rhi: It’s been over a week at this point since you checked in at The Hound’s Paw. Since Blaire was saying everything’s fine but don’t go back up there, I don’t know if you guys wanna head somewhere else for dinner.
Minna (as Myra): Let’s go check in on Rigney.
Rhi: Yeah. You head through the streets, get to Nightmarket, which is quite lively this time of night. This is the start of their nighttime rush; things are picking up. Head around to the back at The Hound’s Paw and knock on the door. There’s a bit of a delay before the door opens a crack. You see a sliver of Rigney’s face peering out. Then the door flings open, probably nearly whacks one of you in the face.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, there you are! It’s been– I– We need to figure out a way that I can get in touch with you when you don’t come around here, because it’s… Ah, come on in, come on in! I have got your table cleared for you.
Rhi: He very enthusiastically ushers you inside.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, that’s such a relief to hear today.
Minna (as Myra): It’s good to see you again.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, it’s good to see all of you. Come on.
Kim: Can I hug Rigney?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Oh, yeah, sure.
Kim (as Blaire): I missed your tea.
Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Aww. He gives you a one-armed hug back and pats your arm.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, once I get you all seated, I will get you a round of your favorites on the house.
Rhi: As he’s walking you up through the back rooms towards the bar proper, he says:
Rhi (as Rigney): I heard from that one Bluecoat friend of yours, uh, Laroze, that you all were in the clear for something. He didn’t specifically say what the accusation was, but he said that somebody in The Red Sashes got arrested for whatever it was. I guess with what happened to The Red Sashes, it’s not like anybody’s gonna be coming to their defense.
Josie (as Minx): Oh. Did the war turn out unfavorably?
Rhi (as Rigney): That’s a delicate way of putting it. The Lampblacks stormed their headquarters, and from what I hear, it was a bloodbath.
Josie (as Minx): Mm. That sounds like him, all right.
Rhi: Sits you guys down at your table. The bar is probably like three quarters full, but your table is clear. He walks you guys over, sits you guys down.
Rhi (as Rigney): Give me a couple minutes and I will be back with your usual.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi: Gives you guys a big grin and then heads off to the bar.
Minna: I think Myra looks at Minx.
Minna (as Myra): Aren’t you glad we smoothed things over with Bazso?
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Thank you again.
Minna (as Myra): He seems an all right sort, for what he is.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. He’s a very dependable fellow; very capable.
Minna (as Myra): I like dependable.
Rhi: Very quickly, it seems like Rigney just put whatever other requests he had on hold to take care of you guys. He comes back over with your usual drink orders, asks if you guys want any food.
Josie: Minx is gonna order something perhaps a little too expensive, but she’s feeling good; she’s back here.
Minna: [happy sigh]
Rhi: He heads off to put your food in.
Minna: There’s been a little bit of relative quiet.
Minna (as Myra): Well, I’ve been doing some research at Charterhall University about some of the information we saw about The Circle of Flame. There was a phrase that stuck out to me, “blood-iron ring.”
Kim (as Blaire): Huh.
Josie (as Minx): Hmm.
Minna (as Myra): I have been looking into it. It seems that it’s a little-known artifact, a legendary lost object. Lots of rumors about vampirism around it. It is said to have been forged some centuries ago by a sorcerer. They say that the iron in it was drawn from the blood of a single sacrificed human. There’s some more terrible rumors around that, but that’s the gist.
Kim (as Blaire): Sick.
Minna (as Myra): I did eventually pick up a book on the ring that says what it does. This book has been taken out by somebody called Avrathi. I believe we have seen that name recently in connection with this whole mess.
Rhi: Blaire, the name Avrathi sticks out to you because that was the name on the box that you grabbed that contained your magical eyeball.
Kim: [gasp] Ooohh, okay.
Rhi: This Avrathi person had been smuggling in this weird eyeball thing from Iruvia, and has apparently been doing some research on this artifact that Myra’s telling you about.
Kim (as Blaire): Sounds like they’re into some weird shit.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. At every level, this business gets more and more unsavory.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s just getting good.
Josie (as Minx): No, Blaire, unsavory. This is bad.
Minna (as Myra): It does not get less unsavory when we come to the effects of the ring.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear.
Minna (as Myra): [sigh] It’s described as a plain, hammered-iron ring. It’s got all sorts of pockmarks in it. These pockmarks are supposed to disappear when exposed to blood. It is supposed to give you some of the powers of a vampire, as far as being able to hear thoughts, see in darkness, see invisible things, and find the location of objects. All quite useful, but unsavory.
Kim (as Blaire): And for how long?
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, no.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m just asking! For my notes.
Minna (as Myra): It seems to be a short time. The ring will return to its original appearance after that period has ended. I’m sure I can imagine why some parties might be looking for it.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, yeah. It’s a one-way speed pass to vampire powers.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear. Anything on where it may have been? Was it in the vicinity of Duskwall in any intervening century?
Minna (as Myra): Oh, certainly in the vicinity of Duskwall; the legends are all associated with the city. Just, it has been lost for a long time.
Josie (as Minx): Mm.
Minna (as Myra): Perhaps not, if somebody is asking about it now.
Josie (as Minx): Is there someplace below where one might excavate such a thing? Where would one even find this?
Rhi: Really, these kind of magical artifacts or occult artifacts can be in any number of places. They could be buried in some ruins under the city, like Minx is suggesting; it could be in somebody’s private collection, where they either do or don’t know what they have. It could be in The Lost District, which is a former noble, wealthy district that was ravaged by plague, and rather than trying to rebuild and repopulate, it was just abandoned to The Deathlands—the lightning barrier no longer covers it. There’s rumors that there’s all kinds of lost treasures out there, but you have to brave The Deathlands in order to find them.
Kim (as Blaire): I wonder if I can ask my eyeball friend about this Avrathi guy.
Josie (as Minx): I’m sorry, “eye ball friend?”
Kim (as Blaire): Well, okay, yeah. Friend is a bit of an exaggeration. He may not be a friend, after, you know, examining for my five minutes of the day… that I have been adhering to!
Josie (as Minx): But this eyeball possesses a personage?
Kim (as Blaire): We don’t… Yeah, I don’t know if it actually does that. But I don’t know if it’s really a “friend.” I don’t know.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, I already knew this, but remind me never to visit your room.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, no, there’s a big “keep out!” sign right in front.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. But verbal protests and literary protests don’t always work in the case of Kevin, for example.
Rhi: I think at this point, Rigney comes over with a tray of food.
Rhi (as Rigney): Who’s Kevin? Do you guys have another group member?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, more like a pet.
Minna (as Myra): [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): He sits at the table with us, apparently.
Josie: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Well, yeah. He’s part of the family.
Minna (as Myra): She bought a statue.
Rhi (as Rigney): I see. Uh, all right. Well, congratulations on your statue.
Rhi: He hands out the food and manages to make it halfway to the bar before he starts laughing.
Everyone: [laughter]
Minna: Bless Rigney. I love him.
Madge: Longer than I expected, honestly.
Rhi: On the eyeball and the ring, the one lead that you have there is that name: Avrathi.
Kim: Mhmm.
Minna (as Myra): My feelings are that this artifact should remain buried, but I don’t think it will if they’re persistent.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. It would be poor for business to allow a formerly-extinct gang to return in possession of such an artifact.
Kim (as Blaire): Right, but wouldn’t it be more important for us to get it and, I don’t know, lock it away than let this Avrathi guy try to get his hands on it?
Josie (as Minx): I suppose that would be better.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Although, I would imagine it would be better for it to simply remain lost.
Kim (as Blaire): But what if he finds it first? This guy is actively looking for it.
Rhi: Myra knows that when this book was checked out by Avrathi, it was about six months ago, so this person has quite a bit of a lead on you.
Josie (as Minx): Mm. Well, does anyone have any objections to us pursuing this artifact to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands?
Minna (as Myra): My only objection would be that I don’t know that we’re equipped to do this, but if these people are resurging in Six Towers, then it’s probably best that we don’t let them get too much power.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): And it does seem that our lead at the moment is Avrathi. Do we know anything about this person? Perhaps we could gain a profit in addressing them.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, if this name has come up multiple times, it might be worth looking into them.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Madge (as Phin): Mhmm.
Rhi: None of you really know the name, so you’d have to go digging to see what you could find out.
Madge: [singsong] Gather Information.
Josie: And that’s a thing we shall do. [laugh]
Madge: Yes.
## [00:22:39] gather information: Minx
Josie: I mostly wanna do my deal of hitting the well-to-do folk of the town up, and trying to see if that name passes around in noble circles at all.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Also, reminder: we have a +1 on Gather Information roles.
Josie: Yup. Which means I’ve got a good old 4d6 Sway for this.
Rhi: I assume you all finish up dinner and then head out into the city, or at least Minx does.
Josie: Indeed.
Rhi: And what did you get?
Josie: A 6.
Rhi: 6 with a Sway. Where do you go, who do you talk to?
Josie: I will sit in and make pleasant conversation with folks in Brightstone establishment, mostly keeping things to a beverage to not tax myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: But mostly make small talk, ‘cause, I imagine, cafes in Brightstone mostly exist for this sort of showing off/mingling sort of thing.
Rhi: Yeah. You head on off to Brightstone. There’s a handful of cafes that you know, that you’ve visited before, that have this atmosphere of, sort of, you can just strike up conversations and chat with people over a glass of wine or whatever. And you hit a couple of those, and eventually end up talking to a young woman who looks like she’s from Iruvia. You casually slip the name “Avrathi” into the conversation.
Rhi (as Woman): Ugh, don’t even talk to me about the ambassador. She has just been utterly useless in fulfilling my requests. I simply wish to have some of my belongings—my belongings, my heirloom jewelry!—transported here from home, and she can’t find a way to avoid all of the customs and duty charges, and– Oh! It’s just… [sigh] Useless woman.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, that is utterly unacceptable. How did you even come by her services? Surely there must be someone you can switch to.
Rhi (as Woman): Ugh! Well, no. If I’m trying to business with Iruvia, then it’s just Elstera. She’s the ambassador; she lives in the Iruvian embassy. There’s really no one I can speak to.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, dear. That’s a shame to hear. Do I get the sense from anyone else that this is a frustrating individual?
Rhi: Not really, actually. It just seems to be this one person who is irritated with her. Other people that you talk to actually describe her as being quite charming. Just having her at a dinner party guarantees that you’re going to have a pleasant and charming and intellectually stimulating conversation for your guests.
Josie (as Minx): All right. That’s good to know. I’m gonna relay that to other folks so that we now have a person. I imagine Phin might be able to get something, ‘cause it sounds like she does a lot of bringing stuff in and out that likely involves the docks to a certain degree.
## [00:25:33] gathering information: Phin
Madge: That’s what I’ll do for mine, is I’ll go to the docks, ask around and see what’s going on.
Rhi: What are you gonna roll for that?
Madge: I’m probably gonna do Consort, since I’m not doing anything underhanded to do so. Okay, I got a 5. [chuckle]
Rhi: Huh, 5. Okay, cool. Yeah, you ask around, chat with the handful of people who still do cargo shipping. A lot of people on the docks are just either fishers or work the leviathan hunters. The handful who still do cargo ships are, at the moment, happy to talk, because they have nothing to do because the cargo ship they were planning on unloading is still being held off away from the city while The Spirit Wardens have it locked down for investigation. So, if you ask about shipments from Iruvia, lead around to Avrathi again, when you bring up that name, there’s a few sideways glances exchanged. A couple of them are hesitant, and one of the dockworkers—actually, the woman you that borrowed the spyglass from last time, an older woman—waves a hand.
Rhi (as Older Woman): Ah, she’s fine. I know her family; they’re good folk. Avrathi is a… We like dealing with her when she’s got shipments coming in or out, ‘cause she pays some extra to keep everything quiet, off the books.
Madge (as Phin): All right.
Rhi (as Older Woman): You said you didn’t have any other follow up questions, there, Phin?
Madge: Yeah. I’m good.
Rhi: Okay. We have a name and an occupation, and we know that this person smuggles stuff in from Iruvia, apparently on a semi-regular basis. The dockworkers you talked to said that this happens every few months.
## [00:27:15] gathering information: Blaire
Rhi: So, what else do you all want to try to investigate?
Kim: I do wanna study my eyeball crystal friend and see if I can figure anything out about its connection to Avrathi.
Rhi: Okay, you can do that. What roll would you like to make?
Kim: Hmm. I’m thinking either Attune or Study.
Rhi: Yeah, I would say either one of those.
Kim: 6.
Rhi: Hm, let me think. How to do this… Okay, I know how I’ll do it.
You pick up the eye. You’re studying it, you’re looking at it. It keeps trying to make eye contact with you. You’ve got the name in your head, “Avrathi;” you’re trying to figure out something about it. As you have that name in your head, this thing makes eye contact with you. You get this split-second flash in your head of this richly-appointed office with a very fine tapestry on the wall, beautiful, carved wooden furniture, some maps and paintings on the wall; the desk has papers scattered all over it. And sitting at the desk, an Iruvian woman; late 30s, early 40s. Just what you see, she has a quill in her hand and a piece of parchment in the other; she just appears to be reading it. You just get this flash burned into your head, and then it goes away. You just instinctively drop the eyeball onto your bed.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasp] Okay.
Rhi: The eye is twitching around even more frantically now, trying to look back at you, but it’s facing the wrong direction.
Kim (as Blaire): [quietly] Aww, poor little guy.
Rhi: So it can’t quite see you.
Kim (as Blaire): Can I pick him up and look at the little guy again?
Madge and Minna: [laughter]
Kim: What?
Madge: [laughing] It’s not like it’s a cute little hamster you found! [laughter]
Minna: [laughter]
Madge: It’s an eye! That gives you Force visions!
Kim: He’s a fish!
Minna: Aww.
Kim: He lives in a little glass bowl!
Madge: [Laughing] Aahh! This is so…
Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Just so that I’m clear, Blaire—
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: You wanna pick it up and make eye contact with it again, right?
Madge: [whispering] Oh, gosh, this is such a bad idea.
Kim: Your DM voice is telling me that’s bad.
Rhi: No, do it.
Minna: [laughter]
Kim: Uh…
Rhi: You wanna get more information, don’t you?
Kim: Stop. Don’t tempt me.
Madge: Gosh. [laughter]
Minna: [still laughing]
Madge: [strangled, overcome noise]
Kim: Uh…
Madge: [shrill, laughing] What are you doing?!
Rhi: You were right, it’s a scrying eye. It shows you stuff, Kim.
Kim: I’m gonna roll, uh—
Minna: [dismayed noise]
Kim: Odds I don’t do it, evens I do.
Josie: Uh–
Kim: God, 5. Okay, I don’t do it. I don’t do it.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: It’s fine. I know what she looks like, and I know what, maybe, her office is. That’s enough. We’re good.
Rhi: I will also say, because that was a 6, you will be able to recall information about the office in the future, if you need it.
Kim: All right.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: So, we know who she is, sort of what she looks like, where to find her. As a crew, we have a contact who is Fitz, the collector. I just remember, he’s the very impatient man who wanted me to do it in two minutes or less when I explained things to him.
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: I might go to him and see if he’s heard from Avrathi at all about weird artifacts, or what he knows about her.
Rhi: Are you gonna do Consort for that?
Minna: Yes. And I’ve gotten a 5.
Rhi: You head in to talk to Fitz. He is his usual very busy, slightly dismissive self. Then when you ask about Avrathi, he just scoffs and rolls his eyes.
Rhi (as Fitz): I am an art dealer. I deal in paintings and sculpture and, occasionally, pottery. But she sent people around, asking about all sorts of bizarre, occult things. I want nothing to do with that. I do not wish to have The Spirit Wardens coming down upon me. Bluecoats, I can bribe, that’s no problem; the Inspectors, I can evade. But The Spirit Wardens, that is a brand of trouble I do not need.
Minna (as Myra): What kinds of things has she asked about?
Rhi (as Fitz): Oh, I don’t know. Some ancient relics, um, of a cutter, or a quarter, or something. I don’t remember. Uh, some ring she was interested in, some idols, or… I don’t deal in those things.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, I quite understand. I just thought she might be the type to cast her net wide. Good to know I was correct.
Rhi (as Fitz): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): You said cutter or quarter. Is it just that you don’t quite remember the word?
Rhi (as Fitz): Yes, yes. I—
Minna (as Myra): Hm. I wonder what that wa– Oh. Kotar?
Rhi (as Fitz): That was it, yes. Kotar, yes.
Minna (as Myra): Ah. Interesting. Thank you. If you don’t mind, don’t spread around that I asked about this.
Rhi: He gives you a look of pure offense, like “how dare you doubt my discretion?”
Rhi (as Fitz): Of course not. I—
Minna (as Myra): I thought I would make it clear. That is all. I, of course, don’t doubt you.
Rhi (as Fitz): Yes, well, there’s anything I can do for you right now?
Minna (as Myra): No, thank you. This has been most enlightening.
Rhi (as Fitz): [sigh] Is Minx enjoying that statue?
Minna (as Myra): Oh, she loves it. It has taken up a prominent space in our home.
Rhi (as Fitz): Good. It’s a fine work of art; should be treated with the utmost respect.
Minna (as Myra): Of course. It’s practically a member of the family.
Josie: [snort]
Rhi: He nods approvingly, then sees one of his workers doing something and strides off yelling at them.
Josie: There were no lies told here.
Minna: [laughter]
Josie: Somehow.
Rhi: Myra was completely honest.
## [00:33:05]
Rhi: You guys have gained some information about Elstera Avrathi. What do you guys wanna do with this information?
Josie: Rob her blind.
Kim: Uh, I don’t know if we should do that just yet.
Josie: Aw. [laughter]
Minna: I would like to know more about what she’s found. I don’t know how we could achieve that, exactly.
Madge: We could at least go through her files and see what she actually has her fingers in.
Kim: Yeah, we could do that. We could do some kind of espionage thing.
Minna: Yes, actually do our crew’s purpose for once, the first time in the entirety of the podcast.
Josie: Let’s do an espionage.
Rhi: Okay. So, your plan is to break into the embassy and look for information?
Minna: Mhmm.
Madge: Yup.
Josie: Mhmm.
Rhi: Okay. What type of plan do you wanna do?
Minna: We were suggesting a Deception, with the method being us distracting, me and Minx distracting.
Josie: Mhmm.
Madge: I’m fine with that.
Rhi: So, deception with Minx and Myra keeping her attention while Blaire and Phin do some robbery.
Josie: Mhmm.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: Okay, cool.
Josie: Do we know what people generally import from Iruvia?
Rhi: It’s described as a land of black deserts, obsidian mountains, and raging volcanoes, so there’s probably actually a lot of mining and jewels that come from there.
Kim: [whispering] Black deserts!
Rhi: Art, sculpture, tapestry, spices.
Josie: Art and sculpture. I don’t have to necessarily bullshit about those.
Rhi: [laughter]
Josie: That will lend to my disguise.
Minna: Is my undercover identity still burned?
Rhi: Yes it is.
Minna: All right.
Josie: ‘Cause I’m thinking, we come in being like “hey we want to set up trade route” or something like that.
Minna: I think Myra can pose as a fine secretary.
## [00:34:52]
Rhi: Engagement roll. There’s two competing elements; one of them is a bonus for you, one of them is a detriment, so those will just cancel out. It’s gonna be 2d6, the engagement roll. Ooh, that would be a 3.
Kim: Woof.
Minna: [nervous noise]
Rhi: The Iruvian embassy is a large brick building in Charterhall, not really built in the Iruvian style; they just moved into a big town home and converted it into the embassy. Has a low brick fence around it; there’s a nice courtyard with some fountains and benches and things. Minx and Myra, you two are heading in the front. Phin and Blaire, how are you two planning on getting in?
Madge: Is there a back way we can enter?
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: Yeah, then—
Rhi: Yeah, there’s a servants’ entrance type thing. Blaire and Phin, you guys have split off to try to sneak around to try and get in. Minx and Myra, you two stroll up to the front gates, where there’s a pair of guards in front of the gate leading in. When the two of you approach, one of them holds up a hand to stop you. She says:
Rhi (as Guard): What’s your business here?
Josie (as Minx): Due to my trade, I do believe we need to file some paperwork for the establishment of a art delivery service.
Rhi: The two of them glance at each other. The woman looks back.
Rhi (as Guard): Do you have a meeting arranged with the ambassador?
Josie (as Minx): We did have an appointment for this time. Is this not the case on your end?
Rhi (as Guard): What’s your name?
Josie (as Minx): Nyra Foxglove.
Rhi (as Guard): One moment.
Rhi: The other guard goes inside. There’s a bit of an awkward wait while you guys are just kinda standing there and the other guard is staring at you. After a few minutes the other guard comes back and just shakes his head.
Rhi (as Guard): You’re apparently not on the ambassador’s schedule for the day. I’m afraid that due to recent security concerns, we can’t allow unscheduled, unvetted visitors. So, good day.
Josie (as Minx): Now, hold on just one moment. We did in fact schedule this appointment. It was about three months ago.
Josie: I turn to Myra.
Josie (as Minx): Can you check on that? It was about three months ago, yes?
Minna (as Myra): Ah, yes.
Minna: She flips through her notes.
Rhi: Do you wanna do a flashback to—
Minna: Yes. I think she’s just going to have made up a little passable-looking planner. I think all she would have had to do is just take time.
Rhi: Well, just having it written down in your schedule isn’t gonna be enough. I would say, if you wanna try to forge a note…
Minna: Oh, from– Mm, I like that.
Rhi: So, 1 stress.
Minna: I rolled a 3.
Rhi: You have a forged letter. It’s not great. You’re not sure how well it’s gonna hold up, but you can try it.
Minna: Think she just waves it front of the guard.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I have this, from Avrathi, from months ago.
Josie (as Minx): And now, surely, with this advance planning, we all understand accidents happen. But surely a moment of time can be spared to correct this oversight.
Rhi: I feel like you guys need to do a group social action here, either a Sway or—
Minna: I think it’s gonna be a Sway.
Josie: Mhmm.
Minna: How’s your stress at?
Josie: My stress is at 0, so I will lead. Critical.
Rhi: Okay. Critical from Minx. Myra, what did you get?
Minna: I got a 4.
Rhi: Minx, you don’t take any stress. It’s a critical success. The guard is just like:
Rhi (as Guard): All right, all right, all right. Let me… [sigh] If you have something from the ambassador, then it must have just been left off the schedule, I suppose. [sigh] Come on.
Rhi: There’s a desk where a young Iruvian woman is sitting, still flipping through this schedule book and rummaging through papers. There’s several chairs and couches and a few little tables; this is where you sit and wait for someone to come get you. One of the guards walks you in.
Rhi (as Guard): Have a seat and we’ll get this sorted out. The ambassador may have something else scheduled right now, so it may be a few minutes. I apologize.
Josie (as Minx): Very well.
Rhi: The guard heads back out.
Josie (as Minx): Can I passively try to lend credence here? Like, turn, talk to Myra, and pretend like we’re discussing pieces in our collection that we wanna unload or acquire and stuff like that?
Rhi: Yeah, you two can have that quiet conversation that the assistant would be able to just barely overhear.
## [00:39:40]
Rhi: While you two are doing that, getting in the front door, let’s cut around to the back door with Blaire and Phin.
Kim: Yeah.
Madge: Yay.
Rhi: What’re you two doing?
Kim: Well, I imagine we have to get in first. Is the back door locked at all or no?
Rhi: It’s a servants’ entrance. You haven’t really seen anybody come in or out while you’ve been hanging out back here. Once again, if you want to find out if it’s locked, you will have to try the door.
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: You cannot tell if a door is locked at range.
Madge: Okay. I’ll go up to the door and try and open it.
Rhi: Phin goes up and tries the door. It is locked, but, Phin, you can tell just looking at it, it’s a pretty cheap lock. It’s not a super secure one.
Madge: Can I break it?
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: Cool.
Kim: Okay…
Rhi: [laughing] Hey, Phin got there first.
Kim: Yeah, yeah. I would have picked it, but…
Madge: Do you wanna pick it? I mean, wrecking can be a backup option.
Kim: All right.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky, standard effect.
Kim: [gasp] 6!
Rhi: Okay. You look at this you’re like:
Kim (as Blaire): Psh! I got this.
Rhi: Pop the lock, and yeah, the door is open. Inside there is a dimly-lit hallway with a few doors and doorways leading off. Then you can see, about halfway down, there’s a set of stairs heading up.
Kim: And that’s the only set of stairs?
Rhi: That you can see, yeah.
Kim: I guess we should head up those stairs, then.
Rhi: All right. You guys wanna sneak-sneak-sneak?
Kim: Sneaky-sneak.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Do you wanna do that as a group thing?
Kim: Yeah, we can.
Madge: Yeah. How much stress do you have?
Kim: I have 3. I have the stress to spare.
Madge: Okay, cool. Yeah, go ahead. Would be good. [laugh]
Kim: 3.
Madge: 4.
Rhi: 4, okay. The four is the result.
Kim: So, do I take—
Rhi: You take 1 stress.
Kim: All right.
Rhi: I’m gonna say you have reduced effect. You guys start sneaking towards the stairs, sneak, sneak, sneak, and you’re only about halfway there when you have to duck into a nearby closet to hide, because someone comes down the stairs and heads up towards the other side of the building.
Kim: Anything cool in the closet?
Rhi: Uh, no. There’s just like a couple brooms, and a mom, and a bucket.
Kim: Ew.
Minna: [giggle]
Rhi: And some dust rags. Bucket’s empty.
Minna: You’ve shoved these kids into a broom closet together.
Rhi: I am obligated to do it once a campaign.
Madge and Minna: [laughter]
## [00:42:18]
Rhi: We’ll follow that person back up to the front room, where Minx and Myra have been chatting quietly about their plans for art sales. A young Iruvian man in a nice, very finely-tailored suit, comes over.
Rhi (as Young Man): I am terribly sorry about the mix-up, Ms. Foxglove. Seems that your appointment did not make it onto the schedule.
Rhi: He shoots a glare over his shoulder at the girl sitting at the desk, who shrinks in on herself.
Kim: Leave her alone, she’s making minimum wage!
Josie: [sympathetic noise]
Rhi (as Young Man): Unfortunately, the ambassador is meeting with someone else right now. However, if you are willing to wait a bit, she does have some open time in her schedule. She should be done with her current meeting in, I hope, 15 to 20 minutes, if you don’t mind waiting.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I suppose things like these happen.
Josie: I turn my Myra and ask:
Josie (as Minx): Do we indeed have time to wait?
Minna (as Myra): I do believe we have time to wait. Your meeting with that collector isn’t for another hour or so.
Josie (as Minx): And how long, pray tell, do her meetings tend to take in this case?
Rhi (as Young Man): Hopefully, it should take no more than 30, 40 minutes. It also depends on what sort of questions you have. But I think less than hour. And if the next meeting you have to get to is—
Minna (as Myra): Oh, Ms. Foxglove, if you don’t mind, I think I’ll go see if I can find a message runner to see if we can push back that meeting.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Very well.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure he’ll be understanding.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Very well, I do believe the wait shall be amenable. Please do be conscious of our potential time limit.
Rhi (as Young Man): Of course, of course. And I do apologize again for the mix-up. Can I get you anything to drink? A refreshment?
Josie: I’ll order not a super fancy tea but the sort of tea where… You serve a distinguished guest this.
Rhi: Yeah, something that isn’t made with mushrooms.
Josie: Yes.
## [00:44:21]
Rhi: He heads off again. Before he goes back down the hall, Blaire and Phin, I imagine you guys are peering out through a little crack in the closet door. You see that guy come down the stairs and then disappear up into the front of the house. Do you guys wanna try to continue to sneak up towards the stairs?
Kim and Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Although Myra’s trying to make contact with them, right?
Minna: Yes. I was hoping I could sneak around the back and try to find them?
Rhi: Okay. I think they’re gonna do their thing first.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: There’s four of you in the part and we’ve split you three ways.
Multiple: [laughter]
Minna: Only briefly.
Rhi: We hope. All right, Blaire and Phin, do you guys wanna try sneaking up the stairs again?
Kim: Yeah.
Madge: Yeah. And I can go ahead and take the stress this time.
Kim: Yeah, that works for me.
Rhi: Yup. Both of you, yeah, it’s still risky, standard effect.
Kim: Aw, Jesus.
Madge: 3.
Kim: 1.
Rhi: [sighing] Okay. You guys wait a little bit too long to sneak out. You’re opening the door and starting to step out just as that guy comes back down the hallway.
Kim: Shit.
Rhi: So—
Madge (as Phin): Hand me– Hand me the broom. Hand me the broom!
Kim (as Blaire): But– uh– Okay, okay!
Madge (as Phin): Hand me– to– Broom!
Kim (as Blaire): Two?!
Madge: Here– right– One. One broom.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Kim: Uh, I’ll grab a broom.
Rhi: Okay. You both have brooms. You guys are now in a desperate position.
Madge: [sigh]
Rhi: He comes down and sees the two of you come out of the closet with brooms. I assume you start sweeping?
Madge: Yeah. I’ll sweep until he gets a little closer.
Rhi: He sees the two of you and strides towards you a little more quickly.
Rhi (as Young Man): Uh– Excuse me. Who– who are you? How did you get in here?
Madge: I’m gonna smack him in the head with my broom.
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: [delighted] Okay. Good, I like it. What roll are you making?
Madge: Skirmish?
Rhi: Skirmish, yeah. That works. You’re gonna get a point of experience in the Prowess line there, ‘cause this is desperate.
Madge: 5.
Rhi: Okay. You smack him with the broom. He hits the wall and clutches his head.
Rhi (as Young Man): Wha– What the…? Who–
Rhi: And he’s clearly revving up to start shouting. Blaire?
Kim: Yeah. I think I’ll try and knock him out first because I feel like my five-foot-one ass would not be able to move this man consciously into the closet. So that … also be Skirmish?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Oh no. 1?
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Blaire, honey. [laugh]
Rhi: So, Blaire, what I’m picturing is that you stab forward like you’re gonna get him in the gut, and he manages to dodge out of the way, and reaches to his side and draws a saber—and starts yelling:
Rhi (as Young Man): Intruders! There’s intruders! Guards!

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. Thank you for joining us. I hope you’re ready for today’s episode. It’s a big one in a lot of ways. As always, please rate and review us on iTunes if you can. It’s a great way to help others find the show.
A few quick announcements. First, if you can’t get enough of me talking here on Magpies you can listen to a couple interviews I did with some other shows recently. Last week I was on Tales from the Fandom as part of their Women in Tabletop Gaming Month celebration, and next week I’ll be on I Am Here. Links to both shows will be in the show notes, and I’ll tweet the link to my I Am Here episode when it goes live.
Also, Minna and I will be at GenCon this August. I’m running one game of Blades in the Dark that filled up within a few hours of event registration going live, and due to my schedule for the rest of the con I’m not gonna be able to run any others. Sorry about that. I’ll be there all four days, and Minna will be there Friday and Saturday, so if you’re going let us know. We’d love to meet some fans.
Next, Madge will tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Madge: On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm made landfall in Puerto Rico. Now, over six months after the initial landfall, residents of the island are still dealing with damage caused by the storm. Clean water, food, medicine and fuel are still in limited supply, and parts of Puerto Rico are still without power. The entire population of the island, 3.4 million people, has been affected by Hurricane Maria, and the island is still recovering. As the 2018 hurricane season draws near it’s as important as ever to help our fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, which is why our featured charity for the month is Unidos.
Started by the Hispanic Federation Unidos is a program created specifically to help disaster relief and recovery in Puerto Rico. So far Unidos has delivered millions of pounds of food, water, and essentials to help those affected most by the storm thanks to the generosity of people like you. To join them, go to HispanicFederation.org/Unidos and donate. On the page you’ll also find a link to other ways that you can help the people of Puerto Rico.
Rhi: The link for Unidos will be in the show notes.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:35]
Rhi: So, Blaire, what I’m picturing is that you kind of like stab forward like you’re gonna get him in the gut—
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: –and he manages to dodge out of the way, and reaches to his side and draws a saber, and starts yelling:
Rhi (as Young Man): Intruders! There’s intruders! Guards!
Kim: Shit.
Madge: Great.
Rhi: And starts chasing after you guys. You guys basically get chased back out the door and down the alley a ways.
Kim: Damn it.
Rhi: Myra, you probably see the two of them sprint away.
Madge: [giggles] Myra’s outside, so it’s Myra standing there in awkward silence and then out they come, right behind—[laughs]
Rhi: Blaire and Phin, you’re able to run far enough to where you’re able to find a place to hide where they aren’t currently chasing you.
Madge: We jump into a conspicuously placed wagon full of hay, until our wanted level decreases.
[laughter]
Josie: Just beware of any white cloaked individuals coming in from above.
Rhi: [laughs] So Myra, you have currently not been spotted.
Minna: Is it a bad idea for—I think I’m just gonna go casually that way and sneak in where they were. I know the time scale when the office should be empty. I’m gonna try and find a place to hide a little bit closer to the office.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah.
Minna: So, what does a Devil’s Bargain look like there?
Rhi: Hmm. What does a Devil’s Bargain look like? So, you are sneaking back in…
Minna: When I come back that door is going to be locked.
Rhi: And guarded. I think that works. That’ll be the Devil’s Bargain, that the door is gonna be locked and guarded behind you, so you’re gonna be a lot more limited in your escape routes, but yes.
Madge: [laughing] Meanwhile Blaire and Phin are probably gonna go on a bar crawl.
Rhi: [covers mouth laughing] Oh no!
Minna: So, please let me roll to hide in some convenient place. I’ve rolled a 6.
Rhi: Okay, so, Myra. You hear shouting and running, you step into the shadows, you watch Phin and Blaire go tearing past, then you watch the Iruvian man who’d been speaking with you go tearing past, and then there’s a bit of a pause, and then you see a pair of guards with swords drawn go running past as well. As soon as the guards clear your hiding spot you just very calmly and casually walk around to the open back door—
Minna: [nervously Mm-hmm…
Rhi: –quietly walk down the hall and up the stairs, where you are able to find a small office that looks like nobody’s using it right now. There’s a desk and a chair, but bookshelves are empty, there’s nothing on the walls, there’s no papers or anything. It looks like it’s an unused office at the moment. You just kind of quietly duck in there, and close the door. [laughs]
So, circling back to Minx.
Josie: Minx, given that her cover is not blown, decides to maintain it and simply meet up with everyone later, and will make a hubbub about it being unsafe, or what was that, what’s happening, what’s the information.
Rhi: So, the girl at the desk is like:
Rhi (as Girl): I’m—I’m so sorry. I’m not sure what’s happening. P-Please stay seated. Um…
Rhi: And she’s like peering down the hall, but looking back at you a lot, so she doesn’t see Myra. After a few minutes the two guards and the other assistant come back, and you hear the assistant be like:
Rhi (as Assistant): You two, lock that back door and stay on it. I’m going to have additional guards posted around the outside to start sweeping the area. I—[seethes] Those damn Lampblacks.
Madge: [giggles loudly]
Minna: Oh no!
Kim: Yes!
Josie: We didn’t mean to! We didn’t mean to.
[laughter]
Rhi: So, they’re a higher tier than you, but their weakness is: They just lost a huge chunk of their security apparatus, because they kind of used The Red Sashes as hired muscle, and The Red Sashes are GONE, so they are like, kind of reeling and trying to fill in a lot of security gaps.
Josie: Ohhh.
Rhi: Yeah, so he’s assuming that it’s The Lampblacks coming to try to finish the job. [trails quietly into laughter]
Josie: Oh no. [laughs]
Kim: This is the best.
Rhi: So, he comes back in and his hair is kind of tossed from running. He’s trying to smooth it.
Rhi (as Assistant): Ma’am, I am terribly sorry about this. We have unfortunately had some incidents with a local criminal gang attempting—
Josie (as Minx): Well, is everyone safe? Is everything safe? What–?
Rhi (as Assistant): Yes. Yes. There were two attempted intruders. I’m not sure if they were thieves or assassins. There have been—I’m sure the guards out front mentioned that there have been a number of security threats here recently.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm. When one says security threats I generally do not find it means potential assassins have infiltrated the building on a regular basis.
Rhi (as Assistant): I-I know. I’m—[sighs] This is difficult and shocking for us as well, and if you would like to reschedule your appointment until we can guarantee the security of the building I will understand. I’ll make sure that we get something on the books.
Josie (as Minx): I do believe I shall wait before I depart into these unsafe alleys at this time.
Rhi (as Assistant): All right. Please have a seat and I will keep you updated on what the situation seems to be.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Well, thank you.
Rhi (as Assistant): I need to go check in upstairs, but I’ll, uh, bring you more tea. Or would you like wine, if that would help calm your nerves?
Josie (as Minx): Wine would be much appreciated right now. Thank you.
Rhi (as Assistant): All right. Yes. Give me a few moments.
Rhi: He heads off upstairs. Uh, Blaire and Phin. [exasperated laugh]
Madge: [laughs]
Kim: [resigned] yeah.
Rhi: You guys are hiding in a cart. There don’t seem to be any guards coming down upon you at this moment, but you’re about a good two or three blocks away from the embassy at this point.
Kim (as Blaire): [sighs] So now what?
Madge (as Phin): I don’t know. We could probably try getting in through a window, but they’ve probably beefed up security now.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, they’re on high alert now because they saw us. [sighs] Oh, this is not how I wanted today to go.
Madge (as Phin): Mm, me neither. Do you think we should wait across the street from the embassy?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, it can’t hurt to scope it out if we can stay in the shadows.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Well, yeah, we have to move around and make sure it doesn’t look like we’re staring at the place, because otherwise we’ll get in trouble for loitering or whatever.
[quiet snickering]
Kim (as Blaire): Can we go to roofs? Do you think that would be better?
Madge (as Phin): Roofs might be better. Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, all right. Let’s scope it out on rooftop then.
Rhi: Okay. You’re able to scramble up to the rooftop of the building that you’re closest to, and I think for just the moment, this kind of first stretch of your trek back, the buildings are fairly close together, so you can just sort of almost walk across the rooftops. I’m just sort of picturing a lot of the buildings up here, in some places you have to jump down or climb down a little bit because there’s a roof that’s lower, there’s some where you have to climb up a little bit, but they’re all like very closely packed together for this first part of your rooftop trek back towards the embassy.
So, while you guys are doing that, Myra.
Minna: I’m going to wait the 15-20 minutes until it sounds like she takes her old client out.
Rhi: You hear after a few minutes not quite running but heavy, quick moving footsteps go down the hall. You hear a door open. There’s sort of some low voices that you can’t make out through the door.
Minna: Do they sound familiar?
Rhi: One of them you can’t really make out clearly. The one that you can hear sounds like the assistant who’s been talking to you throughout this whole thing. So, you hear them talking, and then after a minute or so you hear the footsteps come back and go back down the stairs.
Minna: I don’t think that she’s gone with her client yet, then. I am waiting for her office to be empty for a minute.
Rhi: So, after probably a good 10 minutes since kind of the whole dust up in the hallway the assistant comes back over to you, Minx.
Rhi (as Assistant): I’ve spoken to the ambassador and her current guest, and she wishes to continue with business as usual as much as possible. Due to the disturbance it’s taken a bit longer to finish up the meeting, but once that’s done I can escort you upstairs and you can meet with her.
Josie (as Minx): I’m glad to hear that business can proceed forward. I must admit I myself am not quite ready to leave yet in any case, but thank you for updating me.
Rhi (as Assistant): Yes, of course. Right, well, I need to return to my work. I’ll let you know as soon as she’s ready to see you.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Do check back.
Rhi: He heads off again. So, let’s go back to Blaire and Phin.
Madge: Yay.
Rhi: You guys have gotten pretty close to the embassy building, but you’re now basically like kind of at the alley that you went through when you were running, and in order to get onto the embassy roof, if that is what you want to do, you’re gonna have to make a Prowl, or if there’s some other way you think you can make your way across, you’re gonna have to make some kind of roll to get from the roof that you’re on onto the embassy roof.
Madge: Okay. I have an idea. My suggestion was if we were gonna move onto the other roof we could distract the guards first by throwing rocks down the alley and then jumping over.
Kim: Oh, yeah. We could do that. If things call for jumping over the roof we should keep that in mind.
Madge: For now we’ll just stay where we’re at.
Rhi: As you’re up there, you do see a single guard come down the alley apparently just doing a looping patrol around the building, but it’s just one guard which is kind of weird, because most places when you’re having people on patrol they will have two guards.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: So is there anything you wanna look for in particular up here, or are you guys just kind of hanging out keeping an eye out for the moment?
Madge: Can I look for other guards? Like, if they’ve positioned anyone on the roof?
Rhi: Yes. I think this is gonna be controlled. There’s not really an immediate threat to you up here.
Madge: Three.
Rhi: The way the building is angled you can’t really see much beyond the alley that you came in, and you kind of push yourself up and lean out, a little far, and then Blaire like grabs the back of your shirt and pulls you back and is like a little freaked out, and yeah, you’re just not able to see anything.
Madge: Dang.
Rhi: Back inside… Myra, you do eventually hear a pair of footsteps come up and then two sets of footsteps go back down the stairs.
Minna: Mm, so she has not left her office.
Rhi: No.
Minna: It’s going to be—Hmm. This is some decision making.
Rhi: Yes. She is alone in her office at the moment. [laughs]
Minna: I’m going to look into the ghost field and see if there’s any ghosts around. [laughs]
Kim: Do it!
Rhi: Cool. Good. I see no way this could go wrong. There’s actually tons of ways it could go wrong and I’m very excited about it.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: I’m gonna ask about the Devil’s Bargain and then make my decision.
Rhi: Whatever ghost you end up chatting with is going to remember you and be interested in you the way that sword ghost seems to have kind of glommed onto Blaire a bit.
Minna: Oh man. Oh man. I’m honestly kind of tempted for story purposes.
Rhi: That’s why I gave it. [smiling]
Kim: Do it~.
Minna: Okay. I’ma do it. I’ma do it!
Rhi: All right.
Minna: I’ve rolled a 3.
Kim: Nooo.
Madge: Good gracious.
Rhi: So, there is a ghost. It still has its very clearly defined features, clothes are still very visible, and based on what this person’s wearing it looks like they were a member of The Red Sashes.
Minna: Mm.
Rhi: And the ghost doesn’t quite notice you at first. She seems to be rushing through the wall in the direction of where Avrathi’s office seems to be, and then like getting sort of blown back, and then she tries that a couple times and then she notices you, and looks at you, and just goes:
Rhi (as Ghost): You. You can get me in there. You can make her pay!
Rhi: And she’s gonna lunge towards you.
Minna: Ahhh! Um, um…
Rhi: So, complication, you’ve got a ghost trying to possess you again.
Minna: Yeah!
Josie: Oh, that’s awesome. Yay.
Minna: Oh my God.
Rhi: Now, you do have a spiritbane charm.
Minna: Yeah. I think it lives on like a chain around her neck, and she just whips it out and holds it up.
Minna (as Myra): You can’t—You can’t have me.
Rhi: Yeah. The ghost sort of—The way that you had seen it go through the walls and then get blown back into the room, it sort of has that blowback on a smaller level where the spiritbane charm seems to knock it back a couple feet.
Minna: I think Myra notices that similarity and she kind of narrows her eyes.
Minna (as Myra): Interesting. She has protection against you. Makes a lot of ghosts, does she?
Rhi (as Ghost): She made plenty when she left us there to get slaughtered! You can get me in.
Rhi: It tries to move towards you, but can’t seem to overcome the repellence of the charm.
Minna (as Myra): Can we make a deal?
Madge: [nervous throat noises]
Kim: [musically] Make a deal with the ghost. Make a deal with the ghost.
Rhi: It stops, eyes you kind of suspiciously.
Rhi (as Ghost): What sort of a deal?
Minna (as Myra): You get Avrathi out of that office, and I’ll get you into it. This is a short term deal. I will not—You cannot join me for very long, but I will get you in there.
Rhi: I think you’re gonna need to make a roll to convince it.
Minna: Yeah. Yeah… What am I doing? [nervously]
Rhi: Yeah. What are you doing? [laughs]
Minna: Okay. What am I rolling, Consort?
Rhi: Probably. It sounds like you’re making an honest deal, as you usually do.
Minna: I don’t think that Ghost Contract works on ghosts.
Rhi: I don’t see why it wouldn’t.
Minna: Okay. I might have to do—I rolled a 6!
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: And I’m gonna make a Ghost Contract with the ghost about that short time period, because yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: I think you have to lower the charm, and the ghost cautiously drifts closer to you.
Minna (as Myra): So, if we’re gonna make the deal…
Minna: I hold out a hand.
Rhi: Okay, and the ghost sort of cocks her head to the side a little bit, and is just like:
Rhi (as Ghost): This isn’t going to work.
Rhi: And like, goes to shake your hand, and then her eyes go wide because she’s able to physically touch and shake your hand?
Minna: I think where our palms met, that’s where the mark appears.
Rhi: It flairs up bright on both of you. She pulls her hand back and shoots you a look.
Minna (as Myra): We made a binding contract. You will stay exactly as long as we have agreed to and no longer, or you will regret it.
Rhi (as Ghost): Very well. You want her out of the office?
Minna (as Myra): I do.
Rhi: She nods, drifts through the door, and you hear a lot of screaming. Every door in the hallway but yours slams open and shut. You hear another scream that is not the ghost, and then running footsteps.
Minx, the assistant has just come to get you.
Rhi (as Assistant): Um, if you can just give the ambassador just a few moments to finish with her notes then I can take you upstairs.
Rhi: And then there’s just screaming and cacophony from upstairs.
Josie (as Minx): What is going on in this embassy? Seriously.
Rhi (as Assistant): I have no idea.
Rhi: This guy just looks like—He has clung to his decorum throughout this whole thing, and now he’s just like ‘fuck, I don’t know.’ [laughs]
Kim: This is above his paygrade.
Madge: ‘I just work here.’ [laughs]
Rhi: As the two of you are standing there looking like just in shock, an Iruvian woman, middle aged, in a nice jacket and long skirt, comes tearing down the stairs and is just like:
Rhi (as Woman): What is going on in here?! There’s some kind of spirit or something up there now! And— Where are the guards?!
Josie (as Minx): Ghost troubles, now?
Rhi: She just starts yelling at the assistant. The assistant is like:
Rhi (as Assistant): I don’t know, Ambassador. I don’t—
Rhi: Like, the two of them are going back and forth, and are just very involved with each other, so Minx, I don’t know what you’re gonna do.
Josie: You know, I think I’m gonna approach the ambassador’s assistant, but also the ambassador, and kind of just try to fuel the shouting chaos, because I’m offended about all this. What’s going on? Why are there ghosts now?
Rhi: So, just trying to keep them all tied up down here?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, okay. That works. I’m trying to think if Blaire and Phin would notice any of this. I think you guys are close enough that you hear screaming. It’s kind of distant, muffled screaming, but you hear screaming coming from inside the building.
Kim: Is there any way I can distinguish between human screams and the ghost scream?
Rhi: That’s a good question. Let me think. Um…
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: I think that you are able to tell the difference, because you’re you. [laughs] The ghost’s screaming, the reason you’re able to recognize it is because it’s super, super loud, louder than most humans could get.
Kim: Yeah, and I’d like to imagine it’s got some kind of echo effect, too. It’s wailing more than like a scream, I think.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, Phin. Phin, Phin, Phin.
Madge (as Phin): What? What?!
Kim (as Blaire): Phin.
Madge (as Phin): …
Kim (as Blaire): There’s some spooky shit happening in there.
Madge (as Phin): Uh, ugh, okay, then we’re staying here, right?
Kim (as Blaire): No!
Madge: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): If there’s a ghost— This wasn’t part of the plan. We should probably check it out. We have to make sure Myra and Minx are okay.
Madge (as Phin): Uh…
Kim (as Blaire): Also, if there’s a ghost there maybe I can help it.
Madge (as Phin): [groans]
Minna: I love this so much.
Rhi: I’m very proud of Blaire for thinking of her friends first,–
Josie: She’s a good girl.
Rhi: –and not immediately like: ‘Phin, there’s a ghost in there. We have to help it! Oh, and I guess we should help Minx and Myra…’
[laughter]
Madge: [groans, face in hands]
Kim: Can I just roll a Prowl to run across the roofs and jump onto the embassy? I’m just gonna fucking do it. I’m not gonna wait for Phin’s permission.
Rhi: If you wanna do it, yeah.
Kim: Oh boy. I think I might push myself. I’ve got a little bit of stress left to spend.
Rhi: What’s your stress at right now?
Kim: Uh, 4.
Rhi: Oh yeah.
Kim: I got a 5.
Rhi: Five, okay. You do it, but there’s a consequence. So, I’m gonna go with the very classic…
Kim: Oh boy.
Rhi: …because this is fun…
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: You get a running start, and you jump, and you sail majestically through the air, and you start to descend and you hold your hands out, and you just barely catch on the edge of the roof, and your feet like bang against the wall, and you’re dangling there by your fingertips. The ghost screaming has kind of stopped, and in the silence after the ghost stops screaming you hear muffled shouting from the door below where the guards are.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: So, Phin. [laughs]
Madge: Phin just like— She was running her hands up into her hair when she saw you jump, like what are you doing, and she just like slowly drags them down her face…
Rhi: [laughs]
Madge (as Phin): Oh my gosh.. Oh… Okay. Okay. Cool. This is what we’re doing now. Great.
Kim: [laughs]
Madge: And I’m gonna jump after her.
Rhi: Okay. Do you wanna—
Madge: What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like? Because I cannot push myself.
Rhi: I know. I know where your stress is at.
Madge: Shut up. [giggles] This is fine.
Rhi: Okay. Let me think. Devil’s Bargain… How do you feel about taking another level 1 harm?
Madge: [clap] yeah.
Rhi: And again, risky position, same as Blaire.
Madge: Okay, so I got a 5 as my highest.
Rhi: Okay. Hoo, oh, I know what’s gonna happen. Okay, so Phin, you’re just like: ‘Why is this happening? This is—Why?’ And then you run, and because you’re in much better physical shape, you land, and rather than your fingers catching on the gutter, your heel kicks off the gutter as you land and you kind of bleed momentum, run off onto the roof a little bit. However, by kicking the gutter, it kind of kicked it loose.
Josie: Oh—
Minna: Um?!
Rhi: And now it’s dangling at an angle, and Blaire is dangling down even further in a much more precarious situation.
Kim (as Blaire): Phin!
Madge: Ohhh no. Okay. Uh… [laughs] How close am I to her?
Rhi: You’re pretty close. It’s the sort of thing where you kind of keep running a couple steps to bleed off momentum, so it’s not like you ran really far.
Madge: Okay, and what’s the level 1 harm I’m doing here?
Rhi: You twisted your ankle.
Madge: Yeah. I’m gonna turn around and I’m gonna try and pull her up. [laugh]
Rhi: Okay. I will remind you, you do have climbing gear, which includes rope.
Madge: Yeah! So I’m gonna use the climbing gear to throw her a rope.
Rhi: Okay, and I think that this will be Prowl, and I think this makes a lot of sense to do as a group check, or like one of you is aiding the other. I don’t know how you wanna—but I think you both kind of need to be involved.
Kim: Right.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Kim: How do you wanna do this? Do you wanna do this as a group? Because I don’t mind—
Madge: Yeah, let’s do this as a group.
Kim: All right. I don’t mind leading.
Madge: I’ll take the stress for it.
Kim: Are you sure?
Madge: Yeah.
Kim: Okay. [laughs]
Rhi: All right. So, yeah, both of you go ahead and roll Prowl again.
Kim: Are you kidding me? I got 3 for both of my dice.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: [breathes heavily]
Kim: Don’t you dare drop me.
Madge: [giggles, sniffles]
Kim: Don’t you dare do it.
Madge: [laughing] I got a 1.
Kim: [shrieks] No!
Minna: No, no, no, no…
Rhi: So, Phin, you said you were gonna take the stress.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: What’s that put you at, Phin?
Madge: Uh, how many do I take?
Rhi: Two.
Kim: Are you okay?
Madge: [growing laughter] … Yeah. I just \sparked\ a trauma.
Kim: Madge!
Josie: God damn it Why?
Madge: [laughs]
Rhi: So, Phin, you run over and throw the rope down to Blaire. Blaire grabs the rope and puts most of her weight on it, and Phin you’re not well balanced up there. You just kind of very desperately, you still got that explosion recovery, your ankle’s fucked up, and Blaire is kind of panicking, yanks on the rope real hard… You lose your balance and fall.
[gasps]
Madge: Gosh
Rhi: And you hit the ground in the courtyard just as the two guards come out, and…
Minna: Oh my God.
Rhi: You have just enough presence to sort of stagger to your feet and run, and you just run, and the way that trauma works is: When you suffer trauma you’re taken out of the action. So, Phin just takes off.
Kim (as Blaire): [weakly] Phin…
Rhi: One of the guards chases after. Blaire, you are still dangling from the edge of the roof… and we’re gonna go back inside. Myra, you heard several thumps and shouting from outside, but you don’t really have time to go investigate.
Minna: Yeah, let’s not. I gotta keep my mind n—I gotta keep my head in the game.
Rhi: Yeah. You don’t have time to investigate, because the ghost comes back and doesn’t really hesitate, just kind of dives into you.
Minna: I think Myra is prepared for this to happen and has built controls around it, so she’s not going to be as freaked out as she could be. I think Myra learnt to deal with the supernatural as a way of protecting herself, and when she’s in control she’s relatively okay.
Rhi: Yeah. Is there anything in particular that’s going through her head as this happens?
Minna: I think it’s one of those she feels another presence inside her chest and she tells herself it’s okay, you are in control, this is only for a short time, focus on the task at hand. What first? You go out into the hallway, and she does so. You go into the office, and you just look for anything useful, and so she begins \casting\ around inside the office.
Rhi: Okay. The thing is, as soon as you get into the office the ghost kind of tries to leave since it can’t get anything out of you, and you don’t get blown backwards the way it was, but you stumble back a couple steps.
Minna: Can I communicate with it?
Rhi: Yeah. It’s basically on a thought-to-thought level.
Minna (as Myra): What did you want in here?
Rhi (as Ghost): I want to wait here for her to come back so she can pay.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sorry, but that is not going to be possible. Is there something that you can do before she returns that will satisfy you?
Rhi: When you say that’s not possible your vision almost goes red with rage.
Minna: I think Myra clenches her fists, but she stays strong.
Rhi: It’s just this kind of seething rage for a few moments, and then it’s like:
Rhi (as Ghost): I will destroy her work then, if you will not let me have her.
Minna (as Myra): Let me find any information she has found on strange artifacts first. Will you help me with that?
Rhi (as Ghost): That was not part of our deal.
Minna (as Myra): If we can satisfy both of our aims, then this will have gone better, don’t you think?
Rhi: If you want to convince it you’re gonna have to make a roll.
Minna: All right. Is this a—What is this?
Rhi: I don’t know. What is it?
Minna: I mean, I think I’m trying to reason with it, and I think it’s probably a Consort. That’s a 4.
Rhi: Okay. Again, you get that kind of seething rage and bitterness, and then it just kind of:
Rhi (as Ghost): Fine, but I can’t help you with anything until I can get out. There’s something in here blocking me.
Minna (as Myra): I understand that. I don’t know how to stop it right now.
Rhi: You can look around to see if you can find something that would be—
Minna: Okay. What do I do for that? Survey?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. You look around very quickly, there’s nothing really obvious on the walls, pull open some desk drawers, and then in the bottom drawer of the desk… you know when you’ve gotten close to it because it’s a struggle to open—
Minna: It’s like placing the same pole of magnets together.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Exactly. It feels very much like that, just that pressure resistance. You can force the magnets together, but it’s hard, it’s really hard. So, you drag the drawer open and have to force yourself to grab this carved obsidian idol that is covered in runes and things, and it’s basically sort of a humanoid figure with its arms crossed up in front of its face, kind of a defensive thing.
Minna: Can I just like toss it out the door? Because that would be useful to have, like if I pick it up on the way out.
Rhi: Yeah, you can just set it out in the hall.
Minna: Yeah, I put it in the hall.
Rhi: As soon as it’s out of range the ghost bursts out of you, and just sort of whips around and looks at you.
Rhi (as Ghost): Tell me what I have to do before I can destroy this place.
Minna (as Myra): I’m looking for anything on the blood-iron ring, or other strange artifacts, but that is my priority.
Rhi (as Ghost): Fine.
Rhi: You go ahead and make your roll. For right now it’s going to be controlled position, standard effect, you and the ghost are looking for information.
Minna: Rolled another 6!
Rhi: Okay, awesome. You find a small, leather bound journal. Unfortunately, as with the notes you got from Arun, it’s in Iruvian, but you’re still able to tell this is something useful because flipping through there are also sketches. There’s a sketch of that idol that you just put outside, there are sketches of a couple other things that you don’t really recognize, there is a page that has a few sketches of things involving eyes.
Minna: [squeamish groan]
Rhi: None of them are an exact match for the thing that you actually have, but they look similar. Then, towards the middle it looks like it was copied as a reference out of that book you had, a sketch of the blood-iron ring, so you’re guessing that the notes on that page probably relate. You’re gonna have to find somebody to translate it, but there’s a bunch of notes there.
You see there’s a letter on her desk, recent date, and you glance at it and your eyes go to the signature which is Harvale Brogan.
Minna: Hmm. I’m gonna take that, too.
Rhi: Yeah. So, you’ve got a notebook of all kinds of fun and exciting notes on stuff, and a letter from Harvale Brogan about something.
Minna: I think I’m just gonna tell the spirit:
Minna (as Myra): I will leave you to your work.
Minna: And leave, and take the idol.
Rhi: Yeah. As you get about half way down the hall you just hear slamming, and things falling and being tossed around, it sounds like there’s a small tornado happening in there.
Minna: Mm-hmm. I’m gonna go back to that little office and try to climb out that window.
Rhi: Okay. So, let’s go back to Blaire, since Blaire is in the most precarious of states right now.
Kim: Oh boy. Yeah.
Rhi: You are dangling over the yard. Phin has just fallen and run off with one of the guards in pursuit.
Kim: Did I see her run away?
Rhi: I think you did. I think you were able to kind of look over your shoulder and see. So, what are you gonna do?
Kim: What do you think would be best to roll to pull myself up there?
Rhi: Probably Prowl, it’s the physical one.
Kim: Oh boy, all right.
Rhi: You could also… There are windows on this floor if you wanted to try to like kick through one of those.
Kim: [humming] There’s a window right at kick height where I’m dangling from right now? Like, knee or foot?
Rhi: Yes. Do you have any space left in your load where you could have like a pistol to shoot it out?
Kim: Ooh, yes I do. I have 1 in Skirmish. We can try that I guess.
Rhi: This feels like a desperate situation to me. You’re dangling one-handed and trying to shoot.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So you’re gonna get experience.
Kim: Cool.
Rhi: Got that going for ya.
Kim: Cool. Three. Okay…
Rhi: Three… Oh boy.
Kim: Yeah…
Rhi: You do shoot, but the kickback makes you lose your grip and you fall.
Kim: [shrieks] No!
Rhi: So, let’s see…
Kim: No… I don’t wanna…
Rhi: On a desperate, a fall like that, you’re gonna…
Kim: Rhi…
Rhi: Oh God, this is gonna be level 3 harm.
Kim: [distraught] Rhi, no!
Josie: Ahh!
Rhi: I’m sorry. You failed a desperate roll.
Josie: Nooo.
Kim: What’s the level 3 harm? [whines, laughs]
Rhi: Shattered Leg.
Kim: Nooo! My baby!
Rhi: You are welcome to try to resist. I don’t know how much stress you’re at. How much stress do you have?
Kim: I have 4 left. I’ll go with the broken leg.
Rhi: Okay. You hit the ground, you’ve got level 3 harm, Shattered Leg. Minx, you in the midst of your screaming argument with the ambassador and her assistant hear yet another explosion of ghostly wailing and destruction upstairs, which means you don’t hear Blaire fall outside.
Josie: Oh dear. What do I do? I think it might be finally time to bail. I’m gonna keep screaming at everyone and slowly edge towards the stairs, but what I’m gonna do is be screaming and then right at the end, just:
Josie (as Minx): Cheerio.
Josie: And then cast my cloak in front of them, and then bolt upstairs gaining the initiative in the situation.
[laughter]
Rhi: Okay, yeah. So, you throw your cloak off dramatically and run.
Josie: Can I opt for it to gently land on their faces?
Rhi: Oh, absolutely.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, you run upstairs just as Myra is running towards the office, and you two almost run into each other outside that door.
Minna (as Myra): Out the window.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Out the window. Let’s go.
Rhi: I’m going to allow that, given the chaos inside, I will let you guys climb down without having to make a roll.
Minna: Nice.
Rhi: You climb down. You see Blaire on the ground.
Kim: Oh, I’m crying.
Rhi: Yeah. She is in very bad shape.
Minna: I think we carry her away.
Josie: Aw.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. You guys get her up and carry her out.
Josie: Minx is fussing with her the whole way. No, precious baby. [laughs]
Kim: No, aw. [laughs]
Rhi: Phin is nowhere to be seen. I don’t know if Blaire tells the other two what happened.
Kim: I’m probably in too much pain at the moment.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire is not very communicative right now.
Minna: I think Myra’s whispering:
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, we’ll get you help. We’ll get you help. Just hold on.
Kim (as Blaire): [whimpering]
Rhi: Yeah, so, you guys manage to limp away with some information.
Josie: So we did get something out of this.
Minna: Oh, we certainly did.
Josie: Did we get any coin at all?
Rhi: Well, it depends on if Myra wants to keep that statue.
Minna: That statue would be useful for the house, but I don’t know.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Wait—Should we have left a Magpie pin?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: I will allow you to have left one retroactively if you want to.
Josie: Yes, do it.
Minna: Yes. [grinning]
Rhi: Oh! Oh! Minx, you have one on your cloak.
Josie: Oh. Yay.
Rhi: Yeah. That’s what we’ll say. Yeah. There’s a Magpie pin on your cloak if you want to leave a calling card.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: So, yeah. You have a notebook full of notes on arcane artifacts, you have a letter from Harvale Brogan that you haven’t had a chance to read yet, I’ll tell you about it when you do, and you have an obsidian statue that seems to repel spirits from at least the space of like, a room. Myra, you’re pretty sure that it would cover most of the common room in The Nest, or you have the option of selling it, and it will get…
Minna: I think it’s up to the group whether we do sell it, but it could be useful.
Josie: I’ll say, depends on how much coin.
Rhi: Five coin.
Minna: Yeah, I feel like we can find other ways to protect The Nest.
Kim: Yeah. We could use the coin, honestly.
Minna: Yeah, especially since Blaire was just hurt, I think that Myra feels it makes more sense to sell.
Josie: We only have space for one personified statue in the common area. We don’t need another one.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: There can only be one Kevin.
## Downtime [0:38:26]
Rhi: We’re shifting into downtime. To start off, Blaire, what are you doing during downtime?
Kim: Blaire is sitting alone in her room, and she is reading this book. It’s one that she’s read before, and it is one of her favorites. She enjoys re-reading it, but right now she just can’t seem to focus on it. The words just aren’t registering in her head. The pain is obviously still there, and she’s so frustrated with herself, and her eyes are watering, and she’s just so angry and hurt and upset, and she’s just gonna fling the book across the room, and then just cross her arms and snuggle back into bed, and try to sleep this off.
Rhi: She’s got her leg in a splint, and bandages and stuff.
Kim: Propped up, yeah.
Rhi: Propped up on a pillow. Yeah… Okay, so, Blaire’s kind of bedbound for a while.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Baby…
Rhi: Minx, how do you spend your downtime?
Josie: I want to talk with Bazso. I’ll leave a note through the normal channel. I’ll make sure to pick up a bottle of his favorite whiskey, but I don’t think Minx likes whiskey so she’s gonna bring a little something for herself too, and she’s gonna fuss way too long over what she’s gonna wear, and like ask opinions and shit of Myra about it.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: I don’t know what advice Myra gives back.
Minna: [laughing] Why is she asking Myra specifically?
Josie: Because you met with him most recently.
Rhi: She’s also the only option. She’s not gonna go and put on a fashion show for Blaire while she’s bedridden with a broken leg, and Phin is still missing.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: So, I think Myra’s gonna ask to you:
Minna (as Myra): Do you want to look like somebody Bazso would be more comfortable meeting with, or do you want to look like the best version of you?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, hmm, yes. I do suppose those diverge a little bit, don’t they. Let’s go with the former.
Minna (as Myra): Dark colors, fairly plain, clean. That would be my suggestion.
Josie (as Minx): I would’ve hoped he’d gain some taste. All right, I shall dress down for this.
Josie: And she will.
Rhi: Yeah. So, where do you go to meet? I will leave it up to you, but my suggestion is some place that you guys hung out at when you were younger?
Minna: Aw.
Josie: Then I suppose it might be like a workers bar where we probably snuck into as children or whatever.
Rhi: You guys grew up in Charhollow, right?
Josie: Yeah. Sooty bar in Charhollow.
Rhi: You get there first. He’s not there when you arrive.
Josie: Yeah. I’ll stake a claim.
Rhi: Yeah. You get a few sideways glances from the factory workers who are in there ,but before anybody can kind of approach you Bazso comes in and is greeted warmly by the workers here. A couple people stand up to clap him on the shoulder, shake his hand, somebody buys him a drink, and he’s like talking to people a little bit, you know, works the crowd a little before he comes over to your table and gives you a once over.
Josie (as Minx): It’s good to see you.
Rhi (as Bazso): I can’t say the same. [sighs]
Rhi: He takes a drink and sits down across from you.
Josie (as Minx): I figured. Although, I’m glad to see something has changed around here. It was not so long ago that neither of us were particularly welcome here.
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, I wouldn’t say you’re particularly welcome around here, but folks around here they like me, they like my group. They think of us as heroes of the working man, and now that we’ve stuck it to those silver spoon sucking Red Sashes…
Josie (as Minx): I was pleased to hear about that. They do have a, I believe the phrase I would have used in the day, way too much of a stick up their arses.
Rhi (as Bazso): [chuckles] Oh, Ellie, I almost missed you.
Josie (as Minx): Huh, well that’s closer than I was expecting, almost. [laughs]
Rhi (as Bazso): Ugh. What do you want?
Josie (as Minx): Well, I suppose for what apologies are worth, pretty much nothing, but that’s what I start with. I am sorry about what I did.
Rhi: He had kind of been leaning back in his chair, starting to raise the glass of ale, and when you say that he sets the glass down and just gives you this look like:
Rhi (as Bazso): You’re sorry. You’re sorry that you bailed in the middle of a job to steal some damn furniture, and left me holding the bag.
Josie (as Minx): Well, like I said—
Rhi (as Bazso): And got me sent—You did nothing to keep me from going to Ironhook. You did nothing to help me when I was in there. Nyryx sent me things. Did she tell you that?
Josie (as Minx): Um, no. No, she didn’t mention that part.
Rhi (as Bazso): [sighs] I have no idea what she sees in you.
Josie (as Minx): Heh. Well, she seems to see less these days, as it were.
Rhi (as Bazso): Oh, maybe she’s finally coming to her senses. Sorry is worth less than nothing. Sorry is a damn insult.
Josie (as Minx): Well then, perhaps an insult is where we need to start.
Rhi (as Bazso): [sighs] What are you calling yourself these days? Minx?
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Minx is what I go by in the crew.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah. Well, run along home, Minx. There’s nothing for you here.
Rhi: He picks up his beer, stands up, and heads over to the bar where a couple of the other people make a hole for him to sit down.
Josie: Minx is gonna drop her affectation and go back to her normal voice, which is a little bit higher and squeakier and a lot more prude, and after Bazso leaves start socializing in the bar.
Rhi: Some of them give you kind of weird looks at first, but once you prove that you can actually talk the talk they start feeling like, oh, the fancy airs, that’s the act, this is who she really is, she’s one of us.
Josie: When I leave, if I can get his eye, I’m gonna wink at him.
Rhi: I think he just ignores you.
Josie: Okay. [laughs]
Rhi: Like, he sees the wink but doesn’t respond.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Fair enough.
Rhi: All right. That’s Minx trying to mend bridges, for whatever that’s worth. Myra, what do you do during downtime?
Minna: I am getting a translator for that journal.
Rhi: Okay. You get back in contact with someone you met when you were doing your info gathering infiltration at Duskwall Academy. She had been in training to be a diplomat to Iruvia, ended up washing out of the program due to high levels of academic stress, she just didn’t want to deal with it, and now does some work as kind of a translator, scribe, sort of a lot of bookish, writing-type things. She doesn’t have her own shop. She rents a little bit of space in a book seller’s shop.
Minna: What’s her name? Should I come up with a name?
Rhi: Uh, whichever one of us can come up with a name first.
Minna: Preet?
Rhi: Sure. So, yeah. You head into the shop and Preet has a little desk area off to the side of the main counter where she does her work.
Minna (as Myra): Preet, how are you? Do you remember me?
Rhi (as Preet): Uh…
Minna (as Myra): It was Lizete.
Rhi (as Preet): Lizete, yes. Oh, it has been quite some time. This probably isn’t where you expected to find me.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, I mean, our lives have obviously gone in different directions. I did not get through the program either.
Rhi (as Preet): Oh, yes, it seemed to be a lot of stress and heartache for very little reward.
Minna (as Myra): Very little. How are the \rewards\ treating you these days?
Rhi: She kinda looks around.
Rhi (as Preet): [sighs] You know, I get a steady amount of work, and I have my own place. My family doesn’t really talk to me anymore, but I’m not so sure that’s much of a loss.
Minna (as Myra): That sounds like the dream. Not so much the family part, but you seem stable. That’s good. I’m glad.
Rhi (as Preet): Yeah, and when work is slow, I have…
Rhi: And she just sort of gestures at the bookshelves.
Rhi (as Preet): …free run of the place.
Minna (as Myra): Well that sounds wonderful.
Rhi (as Preet): It’s… It’s calm. I like calm.
Minna (as Myra): I have kind of a strange favor to ask of you. I remember you were very good with the Iruvian language.
Rhi (as Preet): Uh, yes.
Minna (as Myra): Um, I’ve come across a strange, strange series of notes. I was wondering if you could help me translate them. I would appreciate if you didn’t spread their contents around. Some of them seem like they could be quite dangerous, from what I can tell.
Rhi (as Preet): Let me take a look.
Rhi: And she holds her hands out for the journal.
Minna: She hands it over.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, so she sort of pages through it, and kind of makes a little bit of a face when she sees some of the sketches.
Rhi (as Preet): I will definitely keep this quiet, because I do not want to get arrested or hauled away by The Spirit Wardens.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, that bad, is it?
Rhi (as Preet): Well, yes, quite frankly yes, it’s that bad, actually.
Rhi: She leans over and picks up a satchel she has next to her, and she tucks it away in a small interior pocket.
Rhi (as Preet): I’m going to work on this at home. I don’t want someone to see that here. But yeah, I can work on this for you. Give me maybe a week?
Minna (as Myra): That sounds entirely fair.
Rhi (as Preet): All right. Just come back here in a week and I’ll give you my translations.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi (as Preet): How about you? How have you been since you left?
Minna (as Myra): I’ve been well enough. Exciting life. Not much to tell really, though.
Rhi: At exciting life, not much to tell, she like looks at you, glances back at her bag, and looks back at you, and is like:
Rhi (as Preet): I see… Uh, well…
Minna (as Myra): I wouldn’t worry about it if I were you. It won’t touch you.
Rhi (as Preet): Fair enough. Uh, anyway, I should get back to work.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi (as Preet): Good luck out there.
Minna (as Myra): You too.
Rhi: So, Myra, you head back to The Nest, Phin is still missing, Blaire has hobbled out to the kitchen table, Minx has come back from her errands. You pull out the letter that you found, that was from Harvale.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: It says he confirms that he has people looking for info on the blood-iron ring. He says that there isn’t any new info about the other relics of Kotar. He also says that he can’t loan her any of his gang to guard the embassy, because there have been a lot of injuries and deaths lately. He mentions that three of his people went out on this cargo ship and didn’t come back, and then he says, some upstart gang calling themselves The Magpies jumped a bunch of my people down at The Docks and they’re still recovering. The letter kind of ends with these Magpies seem to be starting to be something of a problem, initially they were just sort of irritating. Now they seem to be doing some actual damage, and next time The Circle meets I think we need to discuss what to do about them.
Minna: [deep inhale] Ugh. We’re gonna be at war…
Rhi: So, the three of you are looking over this letter, and cinematically we sort of pan out into the city… and where’s Phin?
Madge: So, I think Phin is back at the fight pits. That’s usually where she goes. She has really taken a beating over the past couple days while this has been going on and going horribly, while everyone else is doing their stuff. The way that she stands is she’s obviously keeping her weight off of her twisted ankle, but as she fights it gets really obvious that something isn’t as controlled anymore, like she doesn’t pull punches, she is very precise and direct about landing punches where she knows it’s going to hurt after the fight.
She’s fighting with the same guy that she had been up against a couple sessions ago that had totally knocked her flat, but this time now that she’s up against him again it’s going a very different way. The action follows the fight for a couple rounds I think, and then Phin knocks this guy down and she like jumps on top of him and keeps punching him, and doesn’t stop until she’s pulled out of the ring.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, a couple people who are like manning the fight jump in and drag her off, and the guy is like just barely clinging to consciousness, face is just covered in blood and cuts. How does Phin look, as we close out here?
Madge: She’s got one black eye, a cut through the opposite eyebrow, a split lip, and just the biggest grin on her face.

Transcript created by Lyra.
## intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us. To quote the ancient podcasting proverb, please leave us a review in iTunes if you haven’t yet.
There’s a lot of announcements in this episode, so stick with us.
First, we are now on Spotify, so if you want to listen to us there, check that out.
Second, I was recently interviewed on both Tales from the Fandom and I Am: Hear:. If you want to hear how I got into RPGs, other games systems that I like, and more about my GMing style, check them out. I’ll link to both those interviews in the notes.
Third, Minna and I will be at Gen Con in Indianapolis this August. If you’re going, let us know. We’d love to meet some fans.
Fourth, Blaire will not be appearing in this episode, but we do have our very first special guest: Chris AKA Waffles. They’re a longtime friend and a great artist. Our Twitter followers might have seen some of their Blades-themed tarot cards a few months ago. They can be heard on Mouse Guardians and on the soon-to-be-released Iron Hides podcasts. You can follow them on Twitter @Mahaffay. I’ll link to all of their things in the show notes.
Next, Madge is going to tell us about this episode’s featured organization.
Madge: Hey, everyone. We know that last episode we featured Unidos for our featured charity for the month, but that was also the week that the news about Donald Trump’s immigration policy started taking place. So, instead of Unidos this month for the rest of the month, we’re going to ask that you go to 5calls.org and start reaching out to your representatives, because, while the executive order might have “halted” separations, a lot of is still left to be done. The over 2,000 children who were separated from their families still don’t have a plan to be reunited. There’s so much that still needs to be done. There’s families who are being held indefinitely in camps, and the best way to combat this is gonna be calling your representatives and making your voice heard. Without calling, without getting in contact with people, the politicians aren’t gonna change anything. We’re a big, big proponent of political action on this show. I don’t think we’ve ever shied away from that. I extremely suggest that you go to 5calls.org. We’ll put the link in the show notes. Thank you.
Rhi: If you’re in the United States, please call your representatives. I’ll link to both 5calls and Unidos in the show notes.
In addition, this episode is being released on June 26 2018. This coming Saturday, June 30, there will be rallies and protests all across the United States in opposition to the horrific acts that have been perpetrated against refugees and immigrants coming to our country. If you are able, please, please find a protest near you and attend. The more voices we can raise in outrage against this, the more pressure lawmakers will feel to make changes.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## [00:03:15] story resumes
Rhi: I think the first thing to address in the few days after your last score, where you raided the Iruvian embassy, and… Things were not great. How long is Phin gone, and when does she get back?
Madge: I feel like it isn’t just like, “oh, she’s gone for a day and a half,” and it’s fine, [laugh] ‘cause she took trauma. I feel like she’s gone for at least a week.
Josie: Oh, dear.
Rhi: Long enough that everyone else is starting to worry.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Or, is more than starting to worry; is well into worry.
Madge: [laughter]
Minna: Yeah, we’re fretting.
Rhi: So yeah, what happens when you do finally come back?
Madge: She probably comes back in the middle of the night, and then, in the morning, she’s at breakfast like nothing happened.
Minna: Okay. So, we’ve established that Myra’s early for breakfast. So I think when Phin comes out, Myra’s like:
Minna (as Myra): Phin!
Madge (as Phin): Hey.
Minna (as Myra): Uh, okay. That’s how we’re doing this. You were gone for a week.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): No notice.
Madge (as Phin): Yep. [haltingly] I had stuff I needed to work out.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. You’re part of a crew. We were worried. We thought you were maybe in Ironhook, or held by The Bluecoats, or, I don’t know, dead in a ditch somewhere. Who knows?
Madge (as Phin): I was at The Pits. You know, where I go.
Minna (as Myra): Understandable. I kinda wish you’d let us know. That’s all I’m saying.
Madge (as Phin): You guys could have come. Didn’t say stay away or anything.
Minna (as Myra): We didn’t know that’s where you were. After like three days, we kinda figured that wasn’t the case.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I’m back now.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. I’m glad you’re okay. Or– Alive, is what I meant.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. How’s Blaire?
Minna (as Myra): Still got that foot propped up.
Madge (as Phin): Shit.
Minna (as Myra): Bones don’t heal in a week.
Madge (as Phin): I… [inhale]
Minna (as Myra): Everything okay?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. I’m fine.
Minna (as Myra): All right. Let me make you that breakfast, then.
Minna: [laugh]
Rhi: I think Phin is back for a couple days; things kind of settle back into normal. Blaire is mostly keeping to her room. She’ll hobble into the kitchen to get food every now and then, but she just seems pretty withdrawn; buried in her books, dealing with the whole broken leg situation. The three of you who are not limping around start thinking about what the next score is going to be, and, I would assume, as per usual, you guys head on down to The Hound’s Paw.
Josie: Hold on, hold on. Important detail we’re missing: where did we leave Kevin? [laughter]
Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Do you put him in Blaire’s room to keep her company?
Josie: Yes, 100%.
Minna: [laughing] Kevin is by Blaire’s bedside.
Rhi: So, Kevin is left in Blaire’s room to keep her company while the three of you head out.
## [00:06:24]
Rhi: You make your way into Nightmarket down to The Hound’s Paw. I think it’s early afternoon at this point, but there’s a fog rolling in from the sea. It’s an especially gloomy day, and as a result, there’s not a lot of people in The Hound’s Paw. At this point, Rigney’s just hanging out at the bar, absently cleaning some glasses. There’s a couple people at different tables. But Rigney perks up a bit when he sees you guys come in.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, hey. How’s it going? You’re… Hm. You’re short one. Where’s Blaire?
Minna (as Myra): She’s got her feet up.
Rhi (as Rigney): Uh, she okay?
Minna (as Myra): She will be. She caught a broken leg in the last score.
Rhi (as Rigney): [sharp inhale] Oh, damn. Well, you know what? Later on, whenever you guys are heading back to wherever you live… I know she really likes the tea that I make here. I’ll make up some you can take back to her.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, thank you.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, she’ll really enjoy that.
Rhi: He just nods, looking very somber and worried.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, uh…
Rhi: He shakes his head to clear it a little bit.
Rhi (as Rigney): Glad the three of you stopped in. There’s somebody who’s been waiting here to talk to you.
Rhi: Points over to one of the few occupied tables, where you see…
Chris: A Tycherosi woman in sirwal-style pants and layered shirts. Her hair looks like it was just in water. She’s got clear, white eyes, and a bit of a squished face. She looks kind of like a sealion, if a sealion were a person.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: Yeah, and he nods to her and says:
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, she, uh, came in here, said somebody named Sawtooth sent her to talk to you about something or other. Honestly, I feel like the less I know about what you get up to, the better off I am.
Minna (as Myra): Smart man.
Chris: I have a giant plate of squid bits. I think Seeks notices you guys talking, and she waves with a mouthful of food.
Chris (as Seeks): [mumble] Mmmmm!
Chris: [laugh]
Rhi (as Rigney): I’ll, uh, bring over your drinks.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, a direct visitor. It’s been a warm moment since that happened.
Rhi: You guys all sit down.
Chris: I think she pushes the tray of squid bits towards you guys.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, thank you.
Madge (as Phin): I’m good.
Josie (as Minx): I shall abstain. So, what does old Sawtooth need from us?
Chris (as Seeks): Well, Sawtooth is out of supplies, and he’s overcharging. But mostly, he’s out of supplies, and my crew is injured, which is, like, a weekly occurrence.
Josie (as Minx): I do believe we can sympathize.
Chris (as Seeks): And normally, I go to Sawtooth because he always buys too much and then forgets to sell it. But now, he’s been robbed, and I have no medicine. And he said to come to you.
Minna (as Myra): So, what he’s looking for is for us to get him some supplies?
Chris (as Seeks): I want you to get me supplies.
Minna (as Myra): Oh.
Chris (as Seeks): I don’t care about Sawtooth.
Madge (as Phin): Fair.
Madge: [laugh]
Chris: I think she leans across the table.
Chris (as Seeks): [in a stage whisper] He overcharges everyone.
Chris: And then leans back.
Minna (as Myra): [chuckle] I think he pays that premium for silence.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Chris (as Seeks): Mhmm.
Josie (as Minx): Will any supplies do, or do you wish us to take back what was stolen?
Chris (as Seeks): Any ones will do. But I don’t have any of the documents or licenses to purchase things.
Minna (as Myra): Mm. I see.
Josie (as Minx): Now, we do not require a license, but we do charge for these things, you understand.
Chris (as Seeks): Oh, yes, I figured. I don’t have much, so, one second.
Chris: Then she takes her back and dumps it out on the table. You get a thing of brass knuckles, and two hand grenades, and some fruit, some glowfruit that she stole from the other side of town, and a little lockbox filled with coin.
Chris (as Seeks): I’ve got this.
Rhi: The worth of it all comes out to roughly 2 coin.
Josie: Hmm.
Chris (as Seeks): And I’ve got a list of people you could rob.
Minna (as Myra): These are all people who sell the kind of thing that you’re looking for?
Chris (as Seeks): Mhmm. These two are fronts for drug operations, and this one is…
Chris: I don’t know. What’s the last one? What do we think? [chuckle]
Rhi: A private doctor who exclusively works with the wealthy.
Josie: Wait, so this list is people we can get the things from, or this is a list that’s part of the reward?
Chris: Oh, no. This is the footwork.
Josie: Ah, okay.
Chris (as Seeks): Parris calls it footwork. I think that’s what it’s called.
Josie: All right. So, the deal was 2 coin and the footwork already done.
Chris (as Seeks): And, uh…
Chris: She thinks.
Chris (as Seeks): Um… Hm. Is that enough? Do I need more?
Minna (as Myra): That’s very helpful.
Madge (as Phin): Would you be coming with us?
Chris (as Seeks): I can help. I am entirely capable.
Josie: She pulls Myra aside a bit and says:
Josie (as Minx): I’m a bit leery of bringing her along on the operation.
Minna (as Myra): Mm, I think it’s best to check the footwork before we assume that these are going to be viable places to rob.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Minna (as Myra): Maybe watch a couple of them; we’ll see how she does while she’s watching with us?
Josie (as Minx): Sure. A test, then.
Madge: I feel like while they’re off whispering, Phin is just poking at the squid bits.
Chris (as Seeks): They’re really tasty.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I already had breakfast. So, you said you’re smugglers? Your group is made of smugglers?
Chris (as Seeks): We don’t smuggle things.
Madge (as Phin): [crosstalk] Okay. What is it you really do?
Chris (as Seeks): We mostly get into fights.
Madge (as Phin): Oh. What kind of fights?
Chris (as Seeks): Uh, Saroja will find something she doesn’t like, and then suddenly we’re embroiled in a bunch of trouble.
Madge (as Phin): [laugh] I think that sounds really cool.
Chris (as Seeks): I mean, it’s pretty fun.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Chris (as Seeks): But then I have to patch them up, because they get all scuffed up.
Madge (as Phin): I am familiar with being the person patched up.
Chris (as Seeks): Oh. I can patch people up.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah?
Chris (as Seeks): I have all the cool tools. [whispering] I stole them!
Minna: [laughter]
Madge (as Phin): [laugh] I won’t judge you for that. I’ve stolen plenty of things before.
Chris: She nods.
Madge (as Phin): How much do you charge?
Chris (as Seeks): Um, what am I fixing?
Chris: She’s gonna go through whatever you say. She’s going to name off the price of supplies, and then nothing else, ‘cause she doesn’t understand how business works.
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Minna: Oh no!
Madge: Sweetheart.
Rhi: It is considerably cheaper than what Sawtooth charges you.
Madge: All right.
Madge (as Phin): And, I have one more question.
Chris (as Seeks): Mhmm?
Madge (as Phin): Are you okay with people coming to you a lot?
Chris (as Seeks): Mhmm.
Madge (as Phin): And you won’t roll your eyes and make snide remarks about how they’re still getting hurt?
Chris (as Seeks): Well, that seems very mean. If they are hurt, they need happiness.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Yeah! They do! And people who don’t give them happiness are rude. I like you.
Chris (as Seeks): Are we talking about Sawtooth again?
Madge (as Phin): Yes, we are.
Chris (as Seeks): He is very rude.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Rhi: So, what is the plan here?
Josie (as Minx): I do believe we will undertake this task. However, we would appreciate it if you were to join us on a bit of scouting. Think of it as a trial run. Then, we will proceed as necessary.
Chris: She nods.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Let’s take a look at the list, then.
## [00:14:40]
Rhi: The first person on your list is Colburn Pharmaceuticals. Similarly, there is Dr. Slain; works in Crow’s Foot. The last name on the list, though, I think, actually, all three of you recognize: Dr. Elias Hagen. The name, you all recognize from the places where you grew up; you’ve seen fliers with this guy’s name on it, or have heard rumors. He tends to recruit people for medical tests or experiments. There’s an offer of good pay. Majority of people come back.
Josie: What happens when they come back?
Rhi: You’re not real sure. You know, you’d hear, like, “oh, my friend’s cousin went and spent a week at his clinic, and then came back with a whole purse full of coin.” You know, you don’t really know the specific details. But he’s been doing this for about a decade.
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: So, what do we know about what he does with his… What is it for?
Rhi: Medical research of some kind.
Madge: I had to deal with people getting extorted where I was growing up, so would I have dealt with more people who were going to him because they needed the money?
Rhi: Yeah. You did know some people a little more directly who volunteered for these experiments. Some of them came back and were fine. Some of them came back and got sick, and then got better. Some of them, maybe a quarter of the people who you heard this about, came back, got sick, and did not get better, and either have some kind of chronic health condition, or they died.
Josie: [noise of distaste]
Madge: When she notices his name, she’s gonna get quiet for a while, and then:
Madge (as Phin): If we could hit him first, that would be really good.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. I do believe we have a philosophically and ethically appropriate target.
Minna (as Myra): Mhmm.
Chris (as Seeks): Those are really big words.
## [00:16:53]
Josie: I think I will hit popular cafes and the like, and start up conversations about him amongst the wealthy.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: So are we supposed to be trying to find out about what he does, or about how to get into his place?
Rhi: Thanks to the information Seeks got you, you do know: his clinic is in Charterhall, but it’s very close to one of the bridges that connects to Coalridge. Easy walking distance for the people he’s recruiting.
Minna: I’d just like to scope out the clinic itself; see if I can find out things about security.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Phin will go with, if you’re okay with that.
Minna: Yeah, totally.
Rhi: Do you wanna bring Seeks along on that, as well?
Minna: Sure.
Rhi: Let’s start with the three of you.
## [00:17:39]
Rhi: The clinic is a fairly unassuming, very square three-story building; not a lot of windows. There’s a handful on the first floor and none on the second floor and third. There are a couple guards standing outside the door.
Minna: And that’s the only way in?
Rhi: This is just as you guys first approach; that’s what you guys are able to see. To get more specific details about alternate entrances, things like that, you can each do separate Gather Information checks to learn stuff about building, or the area, or what have you.
Chris: All right. I guess, before I roll, first question is: is there water nearby?
Rhi: It’s pretty close to one of the major canals, ‘cause it’s basically like, you cross the bridge from Coalridge, and then it’s right there on the corner.
Chris: I guess I’m gonna go see if there are any secret entrances for boats and stuff.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead and roll Prowl to sneak on down there.
Chris: I think I take one of my new friends down to an alleyway that goes into the canals, and I hand them my bag, and then I hand them my pants, and I jump in the water.
Rhi: [laughter]
Minna: I’m just– I’m picturing Myra standing there, holding the pants, like, “what do I do with these?” [laughter]
Madge: [laughter]
Chris: Uh, 4.
Rhi: You hop down into the river. There is, indeed, a dock there. It’s a very simple dock; it’s some wooden slats, a place to tie up a boat, and then stairs. Based on the angle of the stairs and the position of the building, you’re pretty sure it heads up into the clinic.
Chris: Okay. I assume that door is either locked or guarded. Or… what?
Rhi: If you climb up onto the dock, you can go a little bit up the stairs. You’re able to see there is light coming down from the top. You can see shadows moving up there; shadows, people, are moving around. So, there’s people up there.
Chris: Okay. I will return, and just stick my head out of the water.
Chris (as Seeks): There’s a back door.
Minna (as Myra): Is it guarded?
Chris (as Seeks): I mean, yeah. But it’s probably less guarded, and we can use it as a better getaway, because the cops will come from the streets. They always come from the streets.
Rhi: That is what Seeks has learned. And, presumably, she eventually gets out of the water and reclaims her pants.
Minna: Yeah, at this point, Myra holds out her pants.
Minna (as Myra): Do– Do you want these back?
Minna: [laugh]
Chris: She takes her pants.
## [00:20:08]
Rhi: Phin, Myra?
Minna: Hmm.
Rhi: What do you guys wanna do?
Minna: How do supplies get in there? That’s a rhetorical question, and I know you’re not gonna answer this right now. But I would like to find out how the supplies get into the thing. Maybe I can use that way to get into the clinic.
Rhi: How do you wanna go about learning that information?
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna express… Who would I ask? I guess I would approach… Is there, like, a secretary?
Rhi: You don’t know. You haven’t gotten inside the clinic.
Minna: No, no. I think she’s going to walk up to the guards.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Minna (as Myra): Hello. Good afternoon.
Rhi (as Guard): Hello, ma’am. What can I do for you? You here for volunteering?
Minna (as Myra): I was actually wondering if there’s a way I could get a meeting with whoever sees to the supplies here.
Rhi: At this point, you’re going to have to make a roll.
Minna: I think it’s going to be… Is it a Consort or a Sway?
Rhi: I don’t know. How do you wanna approach it?
Minna: I mean, I’m being friendly, but I’m not being honest. And I’m probably gonna be making a sales pitch. So, it’s probably Sway, unfortunately.
Rhi: It’s probably Sway.
Minna: I have a 6.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Yeah. [victorious chuckle]
Rhi: The guard looks you up, and:
Rhi (as Guard): Uh, I don’t…
Rhi: Looks at the other guard; just shrugs silently.
Rhi (as Guard): I don’t really know who handles supplies. Guess you can head on inside and ask Cora. She might know. Here.
Rhi: He opens up the door and ushers you inside. The first room that you enter is a waiting room. The walls were, at one point, white. They’re kind of that sad, dingy off-white now. There’s a number of uncomfortable-looking chairs; handful of people sitting in them, waiting around. Then, towards the other side of the room, sitting at a large desk is a woman in probably her mid-50s, with her hair pulled back in a bun, scribbling in a ledger. Glances up.
Rhi (as Cora): Your name, and what are you volunteering for, honey?
Minna (as Myra): Oh, I’m not volunteering. I was hoping I could talk to whoever handles the supplies for Dr. Hagen.
Rhi: She looks a little confused.
Rhi (as Cora): Well, I handle most of the supply ordering for him. Uh…
Minna: Wonderful. You’re exactly who I wanted to speak to, then.
Rhi: Since you’re suddenly brightening, she smiles back.
Rhi (as Cora): Well, sure. Who are you? What can I help you with?
Minna (as Myra): My name is Thena Helles. I’ve started a new business. We’re looking to expand our customer base. We provide supplies to the medical community of Duskwall.
Rhi (as Cora): Oh, you must be awfully new. I’ve never heard of you before.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, see, we’re still just putting out feelers for who we wanna take on as clients.
Rhi (as Cora): I see. All right, well, I don’t think we’re necessarily looking to bring on anyone new… But I might be able to answer some questions, or…
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, actually, if you’re not interested in working with us, it’d be great if we could, you know, talk about how this works, ‘cause we’re looking to break into a similar environment to yours. We want to provide things low-cost to people who are working with the not-so-well-off in the city.
Rhi (as Cora): Dr. Hagen’s a very generous man like that.
Minna: I don’t think the audience cares about the informational interview that Myra then embarks on. [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. They chat for a bit. Cora is very friendly and helpful. You get the sense, as you talk to her, that she is kind of bored out of her mind.
Minna: Yeah. I wanna ask her about the work he does.
Rhi (as Cora): He does a lot of research on medicine and anatomy, and is trying to understand how these infections that break out in some of the poorer areas of the city spread.
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna break in there.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, does he work during those plague outbreaks?
Rhi (as Cora): You know, he’s not really able to get in there and treat people directly. His skills are best used in working on developing cures and medicine, and things like that, you know. So when those sort of things have happened, he usually works with some of his colleagues over at Charterhall to get as much knowledge as they can, and make some treatments to help end the plague more quickly.
Madge: Oh, it’s really good that Phin isn’t there. [laugh]
Minna: I mean, it’s not great that Myra’s there. [laugh] She has a pasted-on smile. I think she’s keeping herself together. She asks a few more light questions, and then she leaves.
Rhi: Okay. That is what you learn.
Minna: Myra gets outside and she’s like:
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I would feel absolutely no iota of regret for anything to do with this guy.
Madge (as Phin): He sucks.
Madge: [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. Phin, what do you wanna investigate?
## [00:25:07]
Madge: Picturing she hears about how far Myra gets. So, to get further, it seems like we’re gonna have to go with Minna’s idea of actually signing up.
Minna: Oh, shit.
Madge: And since Phin is pretty obviously from one of those less-well-off areas, she’s gonna go in. It’s fine. [nervous laugh]
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: She will head in and head up to the desk.
Rhi (as Cora): Oh, hello there. Are you here to volunteer?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Yeah, I’m here to volunteer.
Rhi (as Cora): All right. And was there a particular study you were interested in?
Madge (as Phin): Um, no, not exactly. I was sort of… I have a family back home, and I wanna be able to get back to them as soon as possible, so I was wondering if there was a system where I could see what I would be going through. And then if it’s not for me, I can back out?
Rhi (as Cora): Unfortunately, with some of the potential for exposure, we do need to keep everybody in a contained environment once they head back.
Madge (as Phin): Okay.
Rhi (as Cora): Just so that we don’t cause any outbreaks. There are experiments we do that are only like three or four days.
Madge (as Phin): Okay. How many people do you take back at once?
Rhi: I think at this point you’ll need to do a roll.
Madge: Yeah. [laughter]
Rhi: [laugh] ‘Cause that’s fishing for information that is a little nonstandard.
Madge (as Phin): I got a 6.
Rhi: She’s already been kinda warmed up to be chatty. She’s like:
Rhi (as Cora): Well, you know, it depends on how many people we need. Some of the smaller studies, it’s maybe 20 people.
Madge (as Phin): You take them all at once?
Rhi (as Cora): Usually, yeah. We’re waiting for… We’ve been told to expect another few more. I thought you were gonna be one of them.
Madge (as Phin): Well, you’re in luck, because I am.
Rhi (as Cora): All right. We’re just waiting for, I think… Well, there’s you, and then…
Rhi: She leans past you to count the people in the waiting room.
Rhi (as Cora): I think just a couple more after you.
Madge (as Phin): All right.
Madge: She’s just gonna take a seat.
Rhi: Are you gonna hang out until—
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. You sit down. There’s a chair between you and this guy who looks like he’s, you’re guessing, 30s, but it looks old for his age.
Madge: Yeah, time hasn’t been easy on him?
Rhi: Yeah. The characteristic, he’s got cracked skin on his hands, the coal dust is just caked under his fingernails; probably never comes out. He notices you.
Rhi (as Coalminer): First time?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. My family’s sick, so we need the money.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Well, I know that feeling. [cough] My dad and older brother have been in the mines, and they got the black lung happening, so… Make better money spending a week in here than a month down in the hole. So…
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, I completely understand. My parents are fishermen, so…
Rhi (as Coalminer): Mm. I wouldn’t be too nervous about it. It’s… You’ll feel like shit for a few days, but this Hagen guy’s got some pretty clever tricks. Usually gets you set back up, feeling pretty good.
Madge (as Phin): Does he come in and do the work himself?
Rhi (as Coalminer): Sometimes. He usually shows up to talk to everybody as a group when you first get brought back; gives this whole speech about contributing to medical science, blah blah blah. I don’t know. I tune him out. But he’s mostly got some nurses and a couple other doctors; I think, some of the students from one of the schools up there are helping out.
Madge: Yeah. She’s gonna look him over again.
Madge (as Phin): So, you said your brother and your dad worked in the mines. How old are you?
Rhi (as Coalminer): About…
Rhi: He has to think for a second.
Rhi (as Coalminer): 26.
Madge (as Phin): Huh. Well.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Yeah, yeah. I know.
Madge (as Phin): I didn’t mean to be offensive or anything.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Ah, it happens.
Rhi: He just shrugs. He doesn’t seem like he’s upset about it.
Madge (as Phin): Was it because of one of the things they did to you, or is it just the mines?
Rhi (as Coalminer): Eh, it’s just the work, the life. I mean, I’m sure you know how it is. Can’t imagine it’s a lot more pleasant up on the docks.
Madge (as Phin): Not really.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Yeah.
Madge (as Phin): Between actually going out on the sea and dealing with whatever gang decides to roll in on the docks, it’s not great.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Yeah.
Rhi: You chat with this guy for a while. About an hour passes, and nobody else has come in.
Madge: At that point, she’s gonna brush her hands off on her trousers and be like:
Madge (as Phin): Listen. I thought this was gonna be real quick in and out, but I can’t leave my family alone. One of my brothers is like two.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Oof.
Madge (as Phin): Can you save my spot?
Rhi (as Coalminer): I mean, I’ll try. They kinda do it first come, first serve, you know?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Yeah, I totally understand. But like I said, I can’t leave them alone for too long.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Yeah. All right, well, good luck.
Madge (as Phin): Thanks.
Rhi: So, you head back out.
Madge: Yeah.
## [00:30::37]
Rhi: While the other three are learning all kinds of fun and exciting things about Dr. Hagen and his quote unquote “generosity,” Minx heads up to, once again, chat up the nobility.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: You go, and it’s one of the cafes that you have visited multiple times before. There’s a few of the regulars who recognize you, and are happy to see you when you come in. What kind of questions are you asking as you steer the conversation around to Dr. Hagen?
Josie: I will have an annoying cousin who is sick, and we’re not satisfied with our current physician, and are looking for someone perhaps a bit more up to the standard.
Rhi: Okay. The recommendation you get, almost universally, is that you must see Dr. Hagen. At one point, you get cornered by this old woman who tearfully tells you that she has a daughter who is just about your age. She had a really difficult pregnancy, and Dr. Hagen just spent so much time with her, caring for her, and was there through the whole 20 hours of labor and nature that both her and the child were fine. You manage to extricate yourself before she starts pulling out the sketched portraits of her grandchild.
Josie: [laugh] The wallet-sized sketch portrait?
Rhi: [laughing] Yeah. The wealthy of the city have nothing but good things to say about him.
Josie: Just so we know who we might be pissing off—I’m not gonna make Rhi come up with more names on the spot, but—I want to remember some of the names of people who seem pretty attached to him.
Rhi: Yeah. A lot of these are people who you’ve chatted with previously, so, yeah, you’re able to be like “okay, this person and this person,” and keep track of that. Anything else that you wanna ask about him?
Josie: I am all set there.
Rhi: Okay. You guys all get back together, share your info. What are you guys thinking in terms of planning here?
Josie: Do we wish to attempt a nighttime operation and then deal with the security, or lure people off during the day and make our escape?
Madge: Honestly, getting in is gonna be way easier during the day.
Josie: All right.
Madge: ‘Cause if we pretend that we’re interested in the trial, we can get in, knock everyone out, take what we need, and leave.
Josie: That makes an amount of sense. Do we know where the supplies are in within the building?
Madge: Oh, yeah.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Between Myra’s conversation and Phin’s conversation, you guys have a pretty good idea of where stuff is stored.
Josie: All right, let’s—
Minna: We can make a pretty good guess.
Josie: This seems like a by-the-book Deception operation, then. Good work, everyone.
Rhi: Your plan is Deception, and your method of deception is pretending to be volunteers for medical experiments.
Josie: Yup.
Rhi: There’s no way this’ll go wrong.
Josie: Mhmm.
Chris: Seeks looks incredibly nervous.
Minna (as Myra): Seeks, you are welcome not to come in if you don’t want to. You can always wait in the canal. It might be helpful to have somebody on the outside.
Madge (as Phin): Mhmm.
Chris (as Seeks): I could bring a boat, but what if you need grenades?
Madge (as Phin): Fair point.
Minna (as Myra): I think if we need grenades inside the building, then things are already irretrievable.
Chris (as Seeks): Mm.
Minna (as Myra): Do you sneak into places a lot?
Chris (as Seeks): Sort of. We get caught a lot.
Madge (as Phin): We don’t get caught as often. We’ll be okay.
Chris (as Seeks): Okay.
Minna (as Myra): You care welcome to whatever you would like to do. I’m just offering you the out if you would like it.
Madge (as Phin): Honestly, we could play it… Have two of us go in and two of us stay out, because, no offense, Minx, but you don’t come off as someone who would volunteer to be experimented on for money.
Minna (as Myra): I think you’ve worked very hard not to come off that way. Think it’s a compliment to you.
Josie (as Minx): [laugh]
Chris (as Seeks): We can secure the back door.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
## [00:34:38]
Rhi: All right. Let’s do the engagement roll. And I got a 6! So it is gonna be a controlled position starting off. Phin walks through the door first. Myra, as you’re walking in, you realize, “oh God, I just spent an hour yesterday talking to this woman. She’s gonna recognize me.” There’s a totally different person sitting at the desk.
Minna: [sigh of relief]
Rhi: The two of you get checked in with no problem. You’re among the last ones to get in for this particular experiment blocks; looks like this is one with about 20-ish people. Last person shows up, and you’re all ushered back through this big, heavy steel door that, once you’re inside, clangs shut in a very prison-like way. Basically, get herded into another large room with some doors and hallways going off of it. There’s a few people around in long coats and aprons. As you’re all herded in, there’s a man up at the front of the room who’s holding a sheaf of papers.
Rhi (as Sheaf-Wielding Man): Ah, good. Welcome. I am Dr. Elias Hagen. Thank you all for volunteering today. You are doing a great service for not only Doskval, but for the Empire as a whole.
Rhi: And he goes on and on and on.
Minna: I think Myra’s listening. I think she just doesn’t like it.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s just a lot about “noble sacrifice,” and “betterment of humanity,” and “scientific advancement,” and all that stuff. He finishes his speech; he leaves. Some of the nurses and doctors start guiding people off towards specific doors, and there’s a bit of an opportunity where nobody’s really paying attention to the two of you. It’s gonna be a controlled opportunity to try to slip away.
Minna: Do we wanna do a group action?
Madge: Yes. I can take point.
Minna: I think what it looks like is you grab Myra’s sleeve, and then we’re gonna take this opportunity.
Madge: What would a Devil’s Bargain look like for this one?
Rhi: The guy that you saw the other day is here, and he recognizes you.
Madge: Okay.
Minna: What about for Myra?
Rhi: [thoughtful sigh] I almost want to apply a Masks-type condition of, you are just super, super angry about this whole situation.
Minna: So, I’m less good at my social shit?
Rhi: I think so. I think that’s what I’m gonna go with.
Minna: I kind of enjoy that!
Rhi: Yeah, I think that’s gonna be the Devil’s Bargain, is that you’re at a bonus die now, but I’m gonna say you’re gonna be at reduced effect for social stuff for the rest of the score.
Minna: Fuck yes. I’m doing it.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Okay, I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I got a 3. [laughter]
Rhi: [laughter] Okay. So, Phin, you’re gonna take a point of stress since you’re leading. I know what the consequence is, but it hasn’t quite landed yet.
Madge: Okay.
Rhi: But you two are able to slip away down a hallway that you know will lead you to the basement. You’re gonna start heading through the halls.
## [00:38:03]
Rhi: Let’s jump over to the dock crew. Is the plan for Minx and Seeks to just hang out there and wait with a boat, or do you two wanna come in the back door?
Chris: We’re going in the back door, because I’ve got all these cool toys and I wanna use them. I figure I borrow a boat. Oh, I put all the extra gear in a crate. That way, it doesn’t look suspicious as we’re sailing down the canals.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re at the dock. Looking up the stairs, you can see there’s electric lights up at the top, some shadows moving.
Josie: We know that there is a guard, yes?
Rhi: There’s at least one guard. You’re not sure how many are up there.
Josie: Okay. [laughing] Can we do the old “throw a rock to distract them?” [laughter]
Minna: [laughter]
Josie: I just want to distract them so we can come up from behind and knock them out, and not just charge at them and give them a chance.
Christ: We could hide in the shadows and do something silly, like yell out “help. I am all alone down here, and my clothes are all ruined, and I cannot wear them anymore.”
Various: [laughter]
Minna: [laughing] Seeks!
Rhi: That’s also an option.
Chris: And I have all of these drugs here, which I can put on their faces.
Josie: Oh, that’s good. That’s good, ‘cause I’m out of the drug that I put on people’s faces.
Rhi: Do you guys wanna do this as a group check?
Chris: Can I just assist? Like, use the trance powder as an assist for their Sway?
Rhi: Yeah. You can do an assist and take one point of stress, Seeks.
Chris: Mhmm.
Rhi: Minx, you’re at a completely unnecessary 4d6. Probably gonna critical this again.
Josie: Oh, no. I didn’t critical. I just got a 6.
Rhi: What do you say to lure the guards down here?
Josie: Okay, I’ll make a bit of a scuffling sound, and, I don’t know, drop some things on the ground. I’ll adopt sort of an uncouth accent, and just go over the top with:
Josie (as Minx): Oh, goddammit. Motherfucker! Can someone fucking– Goddammit, I dropped it– Come on!
Josie: And just jingle the vial around a little bit, like I dropped some sort of box.
Rhi: You hear footsteps come down the stairs, and there’s a voice of:
Rhi (as Guard): Everything all right down there?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, I just need a little help getting some of this.
Josie: Throw the pocket sand.
Chris: I assume I was specifically told not to murder anyone.
Rhi: I don’t know if you were.
Madge: Phin is A-okay with you murdering.
Minna: Myra’s not.
Chris: Well, I guess the question is, how often do crows fly above this place?
Rhi: Often enough that it wouldn’t raise suspicion.
Chris: Okay, cool. But I am just gonna chloroform this guy and steal his pants. 6, 6!
Madge: Yay!
Rhi: Okay, yeah. You just rise up from the shadows and slap the rag over his mouth, silently drag him away. Just as Seeks drags the guy out of view, the other guard comes down and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Did you say you needed help?
Josie: Yeah. I’m gonna trance powder. I got a 4.
Rhi: I am going to give in to the temptation for slapstick for the moment. The guy is coming down the stairs towards you, so he’s above you when you throw the trance powder in his face. He gets a big, deep whiff of it, his eyes go all glazy, he wobbles on his feet. He pitches forward and just slams into you, Minx. The two of you go tumbling down the stairs.
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: Minx, you’re gonna take level 1 harm, Bruised, ‘cause you just [tumbling noises] down the stairs.
Josie: I would like to resist it.
Rhi: Okay. It’ll be with Prowess.
Josie: 5.
Rhi: 5? Okay, you’ll take 1 point of stress. You manage to tuck and roll and twist this guy so that he takes the brunt of the damage on the steps. Your hair is a bit mussed, but otherwise you’re fine.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, dear. I was hoping to at least go some portion of the operation with it still intact. But, very well; let’s press onward.
Chris (as Seeks): So, we should steal their uniforms?
Josie (as Minx): I think they’ll recognize anyone inside, even if we’re wearing the uniforms.
Chris (as Seeks): But they’ll try and talk to us and figure out if we were changed guards, and then we could blow more trance powder in their faces.
Josie (as Minx): I do miss having trance powder. I should get on that.
Chris: I hand her another vial of trance powder.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. Let’s do it.
## [00:42:31]
Rhi: While the two of you are getting changed into the uniforms, we will cut back up to Phin and Myra, who are creeping down a hallway that is lined with doors. It’s eerily quiet, so you’re very clearly able to hear two things. One, from a door a little ways down the hallway, muffled crying. And two, footsteps coming up behind you.
Minna: Uh, can I glance over my shoulder?
Rhi: You can. Phin, which direction do you look?
Madge: I’m looking towards the crying.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, you glance over your shoulder. There’s a man who looks vaguely familiar. You might have seen him in the waiting room yesterday or today. It’s the same guy that Phin saw and talked to a whole bunch. He’s following you guys. When you look back, he gives you a hesitant wave and comes over.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Which room did you get assigned to? I think we were in the same group.
Rhi: He sees Phin and gives you a wave.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Hey. Glad you were able to make it in.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Yeah, uh… Which room did we get assigned to?
Rhi: You guys didn’t actually get assigned to a room. You left before you were—
Madge: I know. I’m asking that to Myra.
Rhi: Oh. [laugh]
Minna: Oh!
Madge: [laughing] Trying to seem convincing. Yeah.
Minna: Myra’s looking very tense and a little bit unsure what to do with the situation, because she just got jerked in a very different direction than expected. Are there, like, numbers on these doors, and such? Such that I can… What number is the crying room?
Madge: Yeah! Yeah.
Rhi: 134.
Minna (as Myra): Uh, 134. Right there. You got to us just in time.
Minna: Do I need to lie?
Rhi: Oh, yeah. [laugh]
Minna: Do I need to roll Sway or something?
Rhi: Probably, yeah.
Madge: Can I assist?
Rhi: Yes. If you wanna take a point of stress, you can give her an extra die.
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: Well, 4, but I’m at reduced effect, because it’s social.
Rhi: He frowns at you.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Well, these are all the individual rooms, and I think it sounds like somebody’s in there already. You must have gotten something mixed up. We should probably head back, and get to the right spot.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, you start heading back. We’ll be right behind you.
Rhi: I think he eyes you a little bit, and then is like:
Rhi (as Coalminer): Okay… Yeah, let’s go.
Rhi: And he turns around and starts walking away.
Madge: Okay. Um, I’m gonna… [laughter] Oh man. [pained noises]
Rhi: You’re gonna attack an impoverished coalminer, aren’t you?
Madge: Shut up. No—
Minna: I have a thing that I could do. If you recall, I have a vial of sleep essence, and I could soak a handkerchief in it and sneak up on him if you don’t wanna be too violent.
Madge: Can we do that? Can we please do that? ‘Cause I feel—
Minna: Okay.
Madge: [laughter]
Minna: I was gonna do that before you did anything rash. So, I think that Myra is going to follow closely and grab his arm.
Rhi (as Coalminer): Uh, yeah?
Minna: I think she’s gonna slap her handkerchief over his mouth. [laughter]
Josie and Madge: [laughter]
Minna (as Myra): Sh-sh-sh-shhhh.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you’re gonna need to make a roll.
Minna: Okay. Oh, fuck. Do I really have nothing in Skirmish? Why did I do this to myself?
Josie: [laughter]
Minna: Okay. I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: Since you are ambushing him a little bit, if you wanted to do Prowl, Prowl would also be effective.
Minna: Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha… It’s a 2.
Rhi: You try to just slap this thing onto his face, but you’re not quite quick enough about it. He slaps your arm away and then goes:
Rhi (as Coalminer): What the hell are you doing?!
Minna (as Myra): Shhhh!
Madge (as Phin): Shhh! Shush!
Rhi: A door slams open at the end of the hall.
Minna (as Myra): This man just touched me.
Madge (as Phin): He’s stalking us!
Rhi: There’s a doctor and a nurse or an orderly behind. They come rushing down. They’re like:
Rhi (as Doctor): What are any of you doing here? No one in this experiment is supposed to be in this area.
Rhi: They separate all of you and are like:
Rhi (as Doctor): What is going on? What are you doing?
Minna (as Myra): I was just looking for a washroom. I haven’t been feeling well.
Madge (as Phin): I was going with her.
Rhi: They look at the guy.
Rhi (as Coalminer): I thought that they were heading towards their assignment, and then she tried to slap this—
Rhi: And he reaches down and picks up the handkerchief.
Rhi (as Coalminer): She just tried to slap this on my face.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t like being followed.
Madge (as Phin): We were raised in a very bad part of town.
Rhi: The doctor takes the cloth and can feel that it’s wet and gives it a sniff, and pulls back, and is like:
Rhi (as Doctor): Right.
Rhi: And pockets the handkerchief and turns to the guy.
Rhi (as Doctor): Head back to the central room. You two, come with us.
Rhi: And the orderly swings in around behind the two of you. At first, it seems like you’re going the same direction, back to that central room. Then, before you go in, there’s a sudden turn, and you’re heading off somewhere else.
Madge (as Phin): Where are we going?
Rhi (as Doctor): I think we need to have a discussion about your eligibility for the program.
Madge (as Phin): No, I don’t think any discussion is necessary. We’re fine. We just needed a washroom. She’s been feeling ill.
Rhi (as Doctor): Exactly. Your eligibility for the program.
Minna (as Myra): So why don’t you just take us out and kick us out onto the street?
Rhi: A second orderly comes up behind you. There’s now two people behind you, and the doctor leading the way.
Rhi (as Doctor): You just attacked another one of our patients with slumber essence.
Minna (as Myra): Which I use in self-defense.
Rhi: The doctor glances back over his shoulder and raises an eyebrow.
Rhi (as Doctor): Which nobody from your part of town should be able to afford.
Madge (as Phin): That’s a really big assumption about people from our part of town.
Rhi (as Doctor): And yet, one that I feel perfectly fine making, given the number that I’ve seen.
Madge (as Phin): Prejudiced prick.
Rhi: He doesn’t seem to be especially insulted.
Madge: Dang it. [laugh]
Rhi: I think you two are still being walked down a hall.
## [00:48:38]
Rhi: We’ll cut back over to Minx and Seeks, who are now dressed in guard uniforms that mostly fit. Sleeves are a little bit long on Seeks.
Chris: Yeah. I rolled them up.
Josie: Do we hear any sort of commotion when we come in?
Rhi: You, actually, if you’re just stripping the guards, you would be able to get their keys. [laugh]
Chris: Yes!
Rhi: You unlock the back door and step into the basement, which is kinda the same as the rest of the building. There’s electroplasmic lights along the hall, gray paint on the walls, a few doors. The hallway curves off towards the end. You don’t really see any stairs from where you’re at.
Chris (as Seeks): This place is really drab.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. They should really hire someone for this. They could use my services in making this a much more pleasant experience. Do you see anything you need here, or shall we press on?
Chris: I guess I will study the room.
Rhi: There’s a couple doors. The one closest to where you come in is a guard station. That one is unlocked. It’s just a table and a couple chairs, and some little storage cubbies. It looks like it’s just where these guards come and put their coats and stuff and sit on their breaks, or whatever. There’s a couple locked doors that are labelled as “linen storage,” and another is “uniforms.”
Josie: Okay. Let’s keep pressing on, then. This isn’t gonna be anything we want.
Rhi: There is one door that catches your attention, ‘cause it’s not labelled. The keyring that the guards have, they’re able to get into most of the doors, and you’re able to unlock these things. There’s this last door in in this hallway that’s unlabeled, and none of the keys work on it.
Chris (as Seeks): Okay, I’m going to open this door. Just keep an eye out for me?
Josie (as Minx): Very well.
Chris: I’m going to take my fine tinkering tools, and I’ma tinker.
Rhi: Okay. This is gonna be controlled, ‘cause there’s not really anybody around.
Chris: All right. And I guess I will push myself for the extra die. No.
Rhi: What’d you get?
Chris: 3, 2, 1.
Rhi: Oh, jeez. Okay.
Josie: [groan]
Rhi: This is a surprisingly difficult lock.
Chris: I think you hear the snap of the lockpick just [metallic twanging noise]. She looks at it, sad. She’s like:
Chris (as Seeks): Hm, fuck this.
Chris: Reaches into her pockets. Vial of acid. Yay! A 6.
Rhi: 6. Okay. Yeah, you melt through the lock, and the door opens. Inside is a fairly dark room, but there’s still a faint glow coming from the vials of electroplasm and some other substances that, at a glance, you’re not sure what they are. But they’re glowing a bit.
Chris (as Seeks): Oh, boy. This is worth a lot of monies.
Rhi: So: electroplasm, as the stuff that fuels basically everything in the Empire, is usually stored in very large barrels. These are in little test tubes. Pretty much everything in here is kept in small quantities.
Josie (as Minx): Um… Any of the stuff you needed?
Chris (as Seeks): Uh, I mean, you can sell all of this stuff for a lot of money, but it’s not medical stuff.
Chris: I am going to take one of the vials.
Josie: Yeah, I’m gonna take a bunch. [laugh]
Rhi: Okay. As you’re looking, you’re able to flick on the light to get a better look at everything. There’s the electroplasm that you guys recognize. Seeks, you probably can tell this, just because of your work: there’s vials of stuff that look similar to electroplasm, but have a brighter glow.
Chris: [Awed gasp]
Rhi: That is raw leviathan blood, unrefined.
Josie: Oohhh. Taking it.
Chris (as Seeks): Do not drink it.
Josie (as Minx): I– I do not intend to drink this swill. I intend to sell it.
Chris (as Seeks): No, but don’t drink it, because then all your flesh gets all bubbly, and it falls off like [wet, mushy sound].
Josie (as Minx): Why do you know that?
Chris (as Seeks): Why do you not know that?
Josie: I’m just going to pocket this.
Rhi: The last set of vials, some of them glow. Some of them look like really deep red blood that has a bit of a glow to it. Some of it looks, at first glance, kind of like The Void Sea captured in a vial. It’s pitch black and has little pinpricks of light in it. There’s some that look like they hold liquid smoke.
Chris: Oooh.
Rhi: It’s very weird.
Chris (as Seeks): I do not like this person.
Josie (as Minx): No, but the good news is we can deprive him of these things. Minx is gonna continue taking everything.
Rhi: You’re able to grab a number of vials. I’m gonna say you can get five each of the electroplasm and the leviathan blood. Then, I think you can grab three of the other ones.
Josie: Gotcha.
Chris: I think Seeks is gonna peruse the shelves and pick up just one of them, the perfect one, and put it in her pants.
Josie (as Minx): [laughter]
Rhi: Okay. You guys have a whole bunch of vials of random things, some of which, you know what they are. Some of them, you don’t. You can head back out, close the door behind you. The lock is very obviously melted.
Josie: I’m gonna go ahead and throw a Magpies pin in there.
Rhi: Nice.
Chris (as Seeks): So, I was thinking. We could steal a couple of things, or we could steal all of the things.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. I don’t believe we’ve come prepared to steal all of the things, but…
Chris (as Seeks): But if we steal the building, we don’t have to move anything.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose that would be true. I… don’t think we have the storage space to store a building, though.
Chris (as Seeks): I mean, the building doesn’t have to move if he just signs the papers. The papers are probably in his office, I think.
Josie (as Minx): I– I’m not certain that would work, Seeks. We’d need to take those papers away to make sure they’re forged properly.
Chris (as Seeks): Well, I mean, he could sign them, and he could disappear, and then nobody would have to ask him any questions about papers in offices.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I suppose so. That’s not… You know what? Let’s find the rest of the crew, ‘cause I do like how you think about these things. But let’s find the rest of the crew, and then decided this. If we wish to steal a building, we will need all four of us.
Chris (as Seeks): Okay.

Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall, and the second half of our guest star episodes. We’re once again thrilled to have Chris, aka Waffles, joining us as Seeks, the delightful Tycherosi Leech. You can follow Chris on Twitter at @Mahaffay and listen to them on Mouse Guardians and the upcoming Iron Hides podcasts. Links will be in the show notes.
We also have a very exciting announcement for the show. We have a website. Visit MagpiesPodcast.net to find an episode list, contact info, cast bios, and character profiles with amazing full-color character art done by Kim. We’ve been sitting on this art for months while Kim did each piece, and I am so excited to be able to share them with all of you. So please, check out the site and let us know what you think.
In addition, if you’re going to GenCon this August, let us know. Minna and I will both be in attendance, and we’d love to meet some fans.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity. My birthday was on Sunday, and so for my birthday month I’m focusing on an organization that’s very near and dear to me. The Glenwood Sunday Market is a farmers market based in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the north side of Chicago. In addition to supporting local farmers and new entrepreneurs with a variety of business programs, GSM has a commitment to food access for the community. In Rogers Park over 20% of the residents use SNAP or other government benefits to feed themselves and their families. At the market we raise funds and apply for grants so that we can help those residents stretch their benefits even further and purchase fresh, local food that might otherwise not be affordable.
This commitment to feeding the community is why I’ve been a volunteer with the market for several years. However, as grants have been cut and donations have slowed, the market is struggling. It’s not in danger of shutting down yet, but we’re trying to keep from getting to that point of desperation. So, I’m asking our listeners to visit the GSM website and make a donation if you’re able. If you’d prefer to keep your donation more local to your community look up your local food pantries and make a monetary donation there. Food banks are often able to purchase food at steep discounts and can spend the money on exactly what they need. With threatened cuts to SNAP looming it’s more important than ever that we help feed our communities.
Speaking of threatened cuts to vital government benefits, if you’re in the United States please also visit 5calls.org and call your representatives. Being loud and demanding and telling them over and over that we as citizens and voters expect our government to serve all people in our country is one of the best ways to bring about change.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:03:21]
Rhi: We cut back up to Phin and Myra who have been escorted through the halls to an unmarked door at the end of one of the halls. The doctor unlocks it, pushes the door open, and points for you two to go in. the orderlies had been about a step behind you. They move forward, they’re not touching you, but the very clear message is that if you do not move voluntarily you will be moved.
The doctor points and says:
Rhi (as Doctor): You’ll wait here until The Bluecoats arrive.
Madge: Phin’s gonna look over like:
Madge (as Phin): Well, you wanted to see if I ended up in Ironhook, so I guess this is a way to find out if I get there.
Minna (as Myra): This is not a good time to joke.
Madge (as Phin): I think it’s a great time to joke, takes the pressure off of the whole situation.
Minna (as Myra): Wonderful for you.
Rhi (as Doctor): [forceful] Now, please.
Madge (as Phin): I’m already in the room! I don’t know what more you want from me.
Rhi: Oh, okay, I didn’t know you… [laughter] GM not being aware that you’re in the room. Has Myra gone into the room?
Minna: [strained] I guess so. If Phin is in the room then Myra is in the room, because Myra has absolutely nothing to stand on.
Rhi: You two go into the room. It looks kind of like a prison cell, more or less. There are two cots, one on each wall, there’s a sink, a toilet in the corner, that’s about it. You two walk in, they shut the door behind you, and it locks.
Madge: I’m gonna go over to the door and wait there and listen until the footsteps go down the hall and I can’t hear them anymore.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Madge: And then [laughs], I’m gonna try subterfuge supplies first.
Minna: Is it subterfuge supplies to pick locks?
Rhi: Subterfuge supplies is like a disguise kit.
Minna: Tinkering tools?
Madge: Oh, never mind. Tinkering tools, yeah.
Minna: Do you have any Tinker?
Madge: [mumbling]
Rhi: No.
Minna: [laughs] I don’t either.
Madge: [laughing] What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: You misheard how many people walked away. One of the orderlies is still outside.
Madge: Okay. I can only do a Devil’s Bargain, I can’t take a Devil’s Bargain and push myself, right?
Rhi: Correct, but…
Minna: I can assist. I’ll take 1 stress.
Madge: Okay. I actually won’t take the Devil’s Bargain. I’ll just take the assistance.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I’m shaking this die real hard. I’m really nervous.
Rhi: [laughs]
Madge: Four.
Rhi: You now hear some footsteps returning back down the hall.
Madge: Uh, I will go back and sit down on the cot, and wait, see if they come in or not.
Rhi: The footsteps come down the hall, pass by the door, keep going, hit the end of the hall and then come back. It sounds like someone is patrolling.
Madge: I’m gonna go back over to the door and I’m gonna wait there as the patrol passes really close by, and as it gets further what I’m gonna do is use my scary weapon or tool for my super freaky brass knuckles. And I’m gonna try to break the lock, [laughs] with Wreck, because I’m better at that.
Josie: ‘I’ma wreck it.’
Madge: I gon’ wreck it! Hoo, that’s a 6.
Chris: Nice.
Rhi: Okay. The footsteps fade off into the distance and you pull out your brass knuckles. They’re like the spiked, hooked…
Madge: They’re the really scary ones.
Rhi: Yeah, freaky ass brass knuckles, and just [impact noise] punch the lock. It cracks, and you’re able to just grind the door open.
Madge: I’ll turn back to Myra.
Madge (as Phin): You ready to go or what?
Minna (as Myra): Tch, more than ready.
Rhi: The route you took to get here was not super windy or anything. You’re able to find your way back to the hallway you were in originally, but as you get up there, you’re approaching the corner and you hear footsteps approaching from the other side of the corner. It sounds like the same gate as the person who was patrolling past.
Madge: Can I hide around the corner and wait until he turns to punch him in the face?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Madge: Would it be Skirmish or Wreck?
Rhi: Skirmish works perfectly fine for punching a dude in the face.
Madge: Yay, 6!
Rhi: With these brass knuckles of power…
Madge: [giggles]
Rhi: …Phin just pops out, clocks this guy in the face, he drops, broken nose, there’s blood streaming down his face… out of commission.
Madge: Uh-huh. Can we still hear the crying? I mean, can we hear the crying again now that we’re closer to where we originally were?
Rhi: You don’t hear the crying anymore, but you know what room it was in if you want to go investigate.
Madge: Okay. I’ll look at Myra.
Madge (as Phin): I wanna check and see if that person’s okay.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. Let’s do that.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, let’s do that.
Rhi: [quietly] Do you guys wanna search the guard that was patrolling?
Madge: Loot the body!
Minna: Yeah. If he has keys or something, I’m looking for that shit.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, he has keys, has a few coins in his pocket, not enough to be measured as 1 coin, but you know, a little extra pocket change. You’re able to head back to the room that you heard the crying from, Room 134. You don’t hear crying coming from inside it now.
Minna: I think we’re gonna check it out anyway.
Madge: Yeah. Door’s getting opened up.
Rhi: You unlock the door, and… You know the way when you’ve had a cold for like a week, the way that your bed smells, just of sickness and sweat and awfulness? That’s what this room smells like. It looks pretty similar to the room that you two were just locked in, not a lot in the way of comfort. Curled up on the bed, huddled up under the thin blanket, visibly shivering even in her sleep, is a young woman just wearing this grayish oversized shirt, that’s basically what you can see. She looks kind of gaunt, she’s asleep, and is clearly very sick.
Madge: I’m going over and kneeling next to the bed.
Madge (as Phin): Hey, kid.
Rhi: It takes you a little bit to wake her up. She groans, squints at the light, and looks at you, looks over at Myra, then looks back.
Rhi (as Woman): [weakly] You’re not… You’re not the doctors. Who are you? [coughs]
Madge (as Phin): We’re The Magpies. The doctors, are they treating you okay?
Rhi (as Woman): [coughs] This is what I signed up for. They, you know, they give you something to make you sick, and then they give you something to make you better. The second one hasn’t really kicked in yet.
Rhi: She pulls the blanket up a little higher.
Minna (as Myra): Have you done this before? Are you usually in separate rooms like this?
Rhi: She nods.
Rhi (as Woman): Yeah. This is the second time.
Madge (as Phin): How old are you?
Rhi (as Woman): Seventeen.
Madge: Phin’s jaw gets real tight.
Rhi: She’s still just kind of looking back and forth between the two of you. After a second she kind of slides one arm out from under the blanket and sort of pokes you in the arm, Phin.
Rhi (as Woman): Oh, okay, not a hallucination. That’s good.
Madge (as Phin): Have you been having a lot of those?
Rhi (as Woman): Sometimes.
Madge (as Phin): How much are they paying you?
Rhi (as Woman): One coin. Spend a week in here feeling kind of lousy, and it’s more than I’d make in a month cleaning houses or… [coughs]
Madge (as Phin): This looks worse than just plain lousy.
Madge: I am gonna take out 2 coin I have and I’m gonna put it in her hand.
Rhi: Her eyes go huge.
Madge (as Phin): After you finish up with this round, you don’t come back here. Okay?
Rhi (as Woman): [weakly] Okay…
Madge (as Phin): It’s not worth it. What’s your name?
Rhi (as Woman): Teagan. My name’s Teagan.
Madge (as Phin): What part of the city do you clean houses in?
Rhi (as Teagan): Up here in Charterhall, some of the nicer places in Crow’s Foot.
Madge (as Phin): Mm-hmm. I’m in Crow’s Foot some of the time. I can check in on you, make sure that you have enough to get by.
Rhi (as Teagan): Yeah, okay… Yeah.
Madge (as Phin): You just gotta promise me you won’t come back.
Rhi (as Teagan): Yeah, I promise.
Madge (as Phin): Good.
Rhi: She kinda tucks the money in under her blanket.
Madge: I’m gonna reach out, I’m gonna smooth her hair back a little bit, and then sort of fix the blanket.
Rhi: She smiles a little bit and closes her eyes again, and looks like she’s gonna try to go back to sleep.
Minna: I think Myra has just been standing there looking almost unnerved, just that anger and then there’s a little bit of white around her knuckles, whatever she’s clutching, the doorway or something.
Madge: I’ll look back over at Myra.
Madge (as Phin): It won’t do any good if we take her right now.
Minna (as Myra): It’ll only hurt her.
Madge (as Phin): Let’s get out of here.
Rhi: So yeah, you two slip back into the hall, and we sort of pan across you two heading for the basement, and the camera just drops straight down to Minx and Seeks continuing on through the basement.
You two see the stairs going up, and I think that the two halves of this group meet half way up the stairs. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Oh. There you are.
Rhi: You do see a room that’s labeled “Medical Supplies,” basically right at the foot of the stairs.
Chris (as Seeks): Perfect.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, it seems our timing is fortuitous. Shall we?
Madge (as Phin): Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Between all of the keys that you guys have you’re able to just open it up. There’s a ton of medical supplies in here. This place is very well stocked. Seeks can get everything she needs and then some. I don’t know if you guys wanna help yourself to any extras. This is the kind of stuff that you guys know you could sell for a decent amount of money.
Josie: I think I’m content with the stuff I’m already carrying, but if other people want to…
Chris (as Seeks): So, I have a question.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah?
Chris: She says, as she’s pulling some bandages off and putting them in a bag.
Chris (as Seeks): We could take the whole building.
Madge (as Phin): [flatly] What?
Chris (as Seeks): You know, we could take the whole building from them. they don’t seem like nice people.
Madge (as Phin): How?
Josie (as Minx): She’s talking of forgery and signing documents and gunpoint.
Madge (as Phin): Oh. Okay. I was thinking you were talking about actually making the whole building disappear.
Chris (as Seeks): Well, I have a friend who could do that, but I can’t do that.
Madge (as Phin): I don’t believe you. Sorry.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I imagine it would be simple to do with fire, but we shan’t be doing that.
Madge (as Phin): As awesome as that idea is, I think for right now we don’t really have the capability to do that. We’re kind of small-time. Not right now, but it’s a good idea. We could turn this place into somewhere that could actually help people—Why DON’T we take this building?!
Josie (as Minx): I mean, there’s nothing wrong with setting a long term goal.
Madge (as Phin): This is my long term goal.
Minna (as Myra): Helping people takes resources. It’s gonna take a while before we have resources to do anything for anybody more than us beyond what we already are doing.
Chris (as Seeks): Anyway. He’s putting demon blood in people.
Minna & Madge (as Myra & Phin): What?!
Josie (as Minx): Yeah.
Chris: I take out the vial of demon blood.
Chris (as Seeks): They had a whole room downstairs that was locked off and they had special keys for it, and by special keys I mean they have no keys, I had to break in… and there is a lot of it, and he’s doing stuff with it, and I don’t like that.
Josie (as Minx): And leviathan blood, and strange containers of ectoplasm, and… This is not sound medical practice.
Madge (as Phin): Minx, Minx, Minx. You think that the rest of what he does is sound medical practice?
Josie (as Minx): No, but—
Minna (as Myra): He prays on the poor in order to perform sick experiments, in hopes of, I don’t know, benefiting the rich patients that he makes house calls on. None of this is good.
Josie (as Minx): I am confronting that, but this is somewhat of another level than I was expecting.
Minna (as Myra): Oh no, me too.
Josie (as Minx): And surely we’re not leaving here without giving him some form of justice, yes?
Madge (as Phin): No, we’re smashing all those vials.
Chris (as Seeks): Oh, but I could sell those.
Madge (as Phin): I’m smashing at least half the vials.
Josie (as Minx): Very well.
Chris (as Seeks): Okay, that’s fair I guess. There’s your half.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. I take half, I smash half, you sell half.
Chris (as Seeks): Realistically, he probably has a leviathan hunter captain on his payroll who is smuggling off excess.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, I understand that. This is going to be a drop in the barrel of what he really needs to come to justice, but you know what, it’s what we can do right now.
Madge (as Phin): I will feel so much better if we just smash everything in that room.
Josie (as Minx): So, you all are going to smash those. I shall join you in a moment.
Josie: Minx is gonna leave, and she has a very familiar look on her face.
Minna: Minx is leaving. I think Myra looks at Phin, and she’s like:
Minna (as Myra): Do you think it’s going to be like…
Madge (as Phin): Well, if she does do anything we’ll cover for her.
Minna (as Myra): That’s fair. Let’s go smash those vials.
Madge (as Phin): Hell yes.
Rhi: Seeks, which direction are you going? You’ve got two people going to smash up a room full of vials, and Minx just said ‘I need to go do something’ and walked off.
Chris: That sounds vague and fun. I’m going to hand them a bomb.
Madge: [gasps]
Josie: [laughs]
Madge: Phin looks delighted. [giggles]
Chris (as Seeks): Just uh, you know, pull this pin and toss it in there, and then close the door, and run.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Okay. Yeah, this isn’t my first rodeo. I know how bombs work.
Chris (as Seeks): Okay.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Chris (as Seeks): We stole this one from a military shipment, and I’m really proud of it, so…
Madge (as Phin): Ohh. This is even better. You are the best person I have ever met.
Minna: [giggles]
Chris (as Seeks): [gasps] I am?!
Madge (as Phin): Yes.
Chris (as Seeks): [weakly] Oh…
Chris: She excitedly chases after Minx. [laughs]
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: So, we follow Seeks who catches up with Minx as she is striding with purpose down the hall, although I don’t think she knows where she’s going.
Josie: Uh, no. I am looking. [laughs] I’m gonna be looking for him, but also his office, but then Seeks catches up to me, right?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): Seeks, are you sure you wouldn’t rather enjoy the festivities downstairs?
Chris (as Seeks): I mean, I blow up a lot of things. It sounds fun.
Josie (as Minx): Well, we’ll see how fun it actually is.
Josie: I’m gonna keep looking for…
Rhi: You’re looking for an office?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Actually, hold on. Can I try to lose Seeks in my search?
Rhi: [cackles]
Minna: She’s a witness~
Josie: Not to be adversarial here, but…
Chris: No no no, this is good. I am excited. I’m going to say you do lose me. I look somewhere, you say ‘check that door there,’ and you’re gone. [laughs]
Josie: Fair enough. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. You’re able to lose Seeks. You’re striding through the halls, and you manage to stay far away enough from other people so they just see a blonde person in a guard uniform and don’t really question it. You don’t find the office on the first floor or the second floor. You go up the stairs to the third floor and there’s another pair of guards at the top of the stairwell who both turn and look at you and go:
Rhi (as Guard): Who are you?
Josie: I’ll ignore their question. I’ll say:
Josie (as Minx): At ease, gentlemen. I’ll only be a moment.
Josie: And just try to brush past them, swiftly.
Rhi: You’re gonna have to roll.
Josie: Yeah. I don’t know if that’s really a Sway. Is that a Command, maybe?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: And I’m gonna push myself about it.
Rhi: It’s gonna be risky, standard effect.
Josie: Yeah. I don’t think I want to take a Devil’s Bargain here yet. Oh no, 3. Whoops.
Rhi: Okay. You start to stride past and one of the guards just shoots his arm out and you almost clothesline yourself on it.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: And he goes:
Rhi (as Guard): Who are you?
Josie: Um…
Rhi: And he’s kind of giving you a closer look now, and the other guard is slowly reaching for the pistol at his side. They’re both very suspicious now. You are in a desperate position.
Josie: I don’t know. I’m really good at talking, but I think I’m going to pull out an unusual weapon. Let’s say coiled on the back of my belt I have… Yeah, you know what, I have a whip. What I’m gonna do is when he goes for the gun I crack the whip out and just lash at their feet to knock them over. I got a 4.
Rhi: You do it but there’s a consequence. Okay. You snap out with this whip, it tangles around his ankles, takes him off his feet, and that’s when the other guard shoots you in the back.
Josie: Ow. Okay.
Rhi: Level 3 harm, Shot in the Back, you are welcome to resist.
Josie: I will resist. I’ve got a 4.
Rhi: So you’ll take 2 points of stress to drop that down to level 2 harm. The gunshot goes off. The other guy has fallen over. Seeks?
Chris: I heard a gunshot.
Rhi: Yeah. I was gonna say—Would you like to investigate?
Chris: I run towards the gunshots.
Rhi: Okay. I think that Minx and this guard are going to have another exchange here before you catch up to them. Minx, what are you going to do?
Josie: Whip the gun out of his hand and run away.
Rhi: You can certainly try.
Josie: I want to try, at the very least.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s still gonna be desperate, and you’re at a -1 die on this roll.
Josie: Yes. What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Hmm—Oh…
Minna: I don’t like that sound.
Rhi: I’m sorry, I just have to…
Minna: You have to cackle evilly, silently to yourself before you deliver this?
[laughter]
Rhi: Those vials you stole…
Josie: Yeah?
Rhi: Some of them are broken now.
Minna: Ohhh boy.
Chris: You’ll need a doctor.
Rhi: Right now, you don’t know which ones are broken, but that glass cut you. So something broke, and something’s in your bloodstream, you do not know what. That is the Devil’s Bargain I will offer you.
Josie: I’m not gonna take that.
Chris: I’ll take it.
[laughter.
Josie: You can’t take it for me. [laughs] I’m just gonna push myself again instead of a Devil’s Bargain.
Rhi: Okay. What are you at for stress right now?
Josie: I just rocketed up to 7 stress including this one.
Rhi: Okay. I had a feeling you were getting up there. Yeah.
Josie: [uneasy] Four.
Chris: Oof.
Rhi: You snap the whip out around his right hand with the gun, and he just swings around with his left hand and clocks you upside the head, and between the gut shot and everything you’re already off balance, and you just fall down the stairs sprawling at Seeks’s feet. You leave a trail of blood down the stairs. And on that note, let’s check in back downstairs.
Madge: I think while they’re getting everything set up, Phin is at least getting some of the blood to sell off later.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: [laughs] You guys pocket some yourselves? Okay, yeah, that’s fine.
Madge: While she’s loading up, Phin’s gonna look over at Myra.
Madge (as Phin): So, you’re actually letting her walk off and actually do this? That’s intense for you.
Minna (as Myra): It’s… It might do better for the city than anything else we’re gonna do tonight.
Madge (as Phin): Mm-hmm. I’m not shaming you or anything for it. I’m actually like really proud.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think it’s great to add to all of the death in the city most of the time, and most of the time a lot of that’s motivated out of how much trouble we’re going to be in, because I don’t want us to get on the bad side of The Spirit Wardens, I don’t want us to get on The Bluecoats’ bad side but we do that plenty anyway. I would like to see next year. This man though, he just, he flicks every switch inside of me, and I don’t like him, and I honestly think it’s the lesser evil to let him die.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. He’s terrible. I am right there with you. Just, the past couple of days have been weird, so I wanted it to feel… I am glad we are on the same page with this, is what I’m saying.
Minna (as Myra): Hey, that thing you did for that girl…
Madge (as Phin): It was nothing.
Minna (as Myra): No. that was a lot. If somebody had done that for me when I was younger, you know, a lot could have changed.
Madge (as Phin): Well, you know, we’re in a position to help, so we gotta take it.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t see it that way enough. I need to remember that, I guess. It’s not all scrabbling to survive anymore. It’s, we can do things now.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. We can actually help people. The more I saw her on that bed the more I thought if I wasn’t around and things went south, and if that was Tabitha on the bed, I’d want someone to do the same thing for her.
Minna (as Myra): It’s a beautiful way to look at life, and I think you remind me of that more than I’d like to admit.
Madge (as Phin): [laughs] Come on. Me? I don’t think I’m the person with a beautiful view on life, at all.
Minna (as Myra): It’s not a beautiful view, but you see people everywhere who could be friends, and it’s honestly a little bit worrying, but also it goes a long way.
Madge (as Phin): Well, you’re stuck with me for now. So…
Minna (as Myra): Don’t talk about it for now.
Madge (as Phin): You ready to blow this place up?
Minna (as Myra): [relieved] Yes.
Madge: And that’s when we’ll plant the bomb, and blow it up!
Rhi: Yeah. You two set up the bomb, and the building shakes a little bit because it’s a military grade explosive.
Josie: [laughs]
Chris: It’s a military grade hand grenade. It’s great! [laughs]
Rhi: As you two kind of both with satisfied smiles start heading back out towards the boat, I assume, we cut back up to Seeks and Minx.
Chris: All right. The people at the top of the stairs, are they going for their guns again?
Rhi: The one guard, you snapped the gun out of his hands and it fell down the stairs with you. It’s kind of skittered down across the hall. The other guard is getting to his feet and has his gun in his hand, but he’s not quite up.
Chris: I’m gonna grenade up the stairs and drag Minx into cover.
Rhi: All right.
Chris: Can I argue for Wreck?
Rhi: I think with a grenade, yes. [laughs]
Chris: All right.
Rhi: That’s not a precision weapon. This is gonna be desperate, greater effect. Do what you gotta do.
Chris: Crit!
Rhi: Seriously?
Chris: Yea. I rolled four dice. I got a 3, a 5, and two 6s.
Rhi: All right. Yeah. So, describe how you kill two people with a military grenade.
Chris: I think Minx slides to the floor in front of me and I just run past her, unclip the grenade, pull the cord and underhand it up the stairs. I think camera-wise we get the people in the basement whose ears are still kinda ringing, and then there’s another explosion upstairs.
[laughter]
Rhi: Just trading explosions here. At this point, you can hear from somewhere else in the building some kind of alarm is sounding, because there have now been two explosions.
Minna: Took them long enough. [laughs]
Rhi: Minx, you have gotten to your feet, bleeding heavily. Seeks?
Chris: I will run back down the stairs and probably put an arm under Minx’s.
Rhi: Do you have some kind of move where you can help Minx?
Chris: Yeah, I can help the bleeding once we get out of here, but for the time being I don’t have any medical supplies.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Chris: I mean, I guess I have medical supplies.
Chris (as Seeks): We shouldn’t stay here. They’re going to kill us.
Josie (as Minx): [groans] I’m not really in a position to disagree, dear.
Chris: So, I think we’re gonna work our way through the building. Once we make it to that one long hallway I’m gonna rig up the last grenade as an entry denial device.
Rhi: As a what?
Chris: As a landmine, or like a trip line. I’m gonna string it up to a door or whatever so when they come running down the hall to kill us it’ll explode.
Rhi: Okay. You two are in guard uniforms, which is helping out at this point because there’s a lot of confusion. There was an explosion in the basement and an explosion on the third floor. There’s a lot of running and a lot of panic. Seeing someone injured coming down from where there was just an explosion makes sense. [laughs] They’re like ‘oh, you got hurt in whatever just happened up there,’ which is true, just not in the way they think.
The two of you are able to make it back down to that first floor pretty much unimpeded. I think in this case… Seeks, you’re rigging up that explosive, right?
Chris: I figured they were gonna come and stop us. If nobody’s really coming to stop us we’re just going to leave.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Nobody really bothers you guys, because they’re assuming you’re just going to get medical attention. Seeks, you get a couple weird looks because people are like ‘we should remember you, right?’
Chris: I pull up my collar.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. There’s too much other chaos to deal with. So, I think you two are able to make it back out just as Myra and Phin have finished loading the last of the supplies into the boat. These two come hobbling down the stairs.
Minna: I think Myra looks at Minx.
Minna (as Myra): Crows for Hagen. Yes or no?
Josie (as Minx): No, regrettably.
Minna (as Myra): We’ll find another way. All right, let’s get going.
Rhi: You all pile into the boat. Minx, this feels oddly familiar, as this is the second time in the last month that you have been lying in a boat after being shot.
Josie: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Chris: I think as we go I’m going to be doing medicine things.
Rhi: Yeah. Now that you’re on the boat with all the medical supplies you can start doing some basic first aid. Yeah. You guys head away. The alarm is still sounding, but nobody seems to be coming after you in your boat in particular.
So, having survived… We’ll shift over into downtime.
## Downtime [0:30:08]
Rhi: Okay. You got the medical supplies for Seeks, and then all three of you, Minx, Myra, and Phin, you stocked up, you grabbed a bunch of those vials. Right?
Josie: Right.
Rhi: How much money is this gonna be? I think I’m gonna go with 6 coin.
Josie: Woo!
Minna: Woof. That’s a big ol’ payout.
Madge: That’s a lot~!
Rhi: It takes you a little bit to find buyers. Selling the electroplasm, that’s easy. Selling the leviathan blood, a little tougher but you know some people. You end up having to talk to Blaire about the other stuff, and that becomes a challenge of her not just hoarding all of these other weird ones and keeping them for herself to study. I think that she does end up keeping a couple, because they’re very interesting, but she tells you with great reluctance that people like The Dimmer Sisters would probably be interested in something like this, so you’re able to sell that weird mix of different stuff in vials to them. between all the different places you sell to, you end up with 6 coin. … Heat. [exhales]
Madge: [giggles] Oh, we didn’t leave a pin.
Rhi: Yeah, you did.
Madge: We did? Oh yeah, we did.
Rhi: Well—
Chris: You blew up the room with the pin in it.
Rhi: Yeah, I was gonna say. Here’s the thing. You know what, here, I’m gonna make a fortune roll to see if the pin survived the explosion. It’s mangled, but it survived enough to be recognizable.
Minna: [inhales, mumbles]
Madge: Woo-hoo-hoo. [giggles]
Rhi: I’m gonna say, let’s see… Loud and chaotic, since you set off two bombs in a clinic, and there was some death. That’s gonna be 6 heat.
Minna: Six coin, 6 heat, we’re doing good.
Rhi: For downtime, Phin, what are you gonna be doing?
Madge: She’s gonna go looking for Teagan.
Rhi: Okay. It takes you a few days of just kinda poking around trying to cross paths with her, but eventually there’s a day where you’ve spent most of the time just wandering around Crow’s Foot, kind of the nicer areas, hoping, again coming up with nothing, you’re heading sort of across the bridges back toward Six Towers, and you see a familiar, young woman hurrying across the bridge down towards Charhollow.
Madge: I’ll run over towards her.
Madge (as Phin): Teagan!
Rhi: She startles and looks over. It takes her a second.
Rhi (as Teagan): Oh, um… [clears throat] Hi… You’re actually a real person. Okay. I wasn’t quite sure. I mean, the money probably should have— Hi.
Madge (as Phin): Hi. I just wanted to make sure that you were okay still.
Rhi (as Teagan): Yeah, I mean, I’m still not… I feel better, but I’m still a little…
Rhi: And she kind of waves her hand, like ‘so-so.’
Madge (as Phin): Well, I have something that I wanna give you.
Madge: She pulls out the coin that she got for her share, and holds it out to Teagan.
Rhi (as Teagan): Uh, no, no. You’ve given me plenty already. I don’t, really—
Madge (as Phin): I want to help.
Rhi (as Teagan): [sighs]
Madge (as Phin): I’m not using it for anything anyway.
Rhi (as Teagan): I mean, if you’re sure.
Madge (as Phin): Positive.
Rhi: She reluctantly takes it and slips it onto her belt.
Rhi (as Teagan): Thank you, and I promise I won’t be going back there.
Madge (as Phin): [chuckles] It feels a lot better hearing you say that when you’re not sick.
Rhi (as Teagan): Yeah.
Madge (as Phin): And if you ever need anything, like besides this, just know that you can come to The Magpies whenever.
Rhi (as Teagan): Where, where’s, where would I go?
Madge (as Phin): You can find us most often at The Hound’s Paw. You can talk to Rigney. He’s really on the up and up. Great guy.
Rhi (as Teagan): Okay, um… Thank you.
Rhi: She basically kind of checks the money pouch to make sure it’s secure, and then skitters on across the bridge. All right, so Myra, what do you get up to?
Minna: Things are pretty crazy for them right now, and I think she might get interrupted at The Devil’s Tooth.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Myra is blissed out on a couch, and there’s suddenly a very heavy thudding on the door.
Minna: I think at this point it’s getting towards the end of Myra being out of it, so she’s at least aware enough, you know, not completely out of control. I think she pushes herself up a little bit onto one elbow.
Minna (as Myra): It’s occupied.
Rhi (as Knocker): Bluecoats. Open up.
Minna: Oh God… I think she’s going to play the helpless card.
Minna (as Myra): Do you know where you are? I don’t think I can—
Rhi: The door just flies open, and there’s a pair of Bluecoats there. They both walk in and basically block off the door.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): [sigh] So, Myra Keel. Right?
Minna (as Myra): Yes?
Rhi (as Bluecoat): You seem to have affiliation with a group of criminals who have been causing some trouble in the city. Anything you can tell us about that?
Rhi: The one Bluecoat crosses his arms, but in a not quite like both hands flat, one of his hands is kind of just held out cupping his palm. This is a gesture you recognize. This is a happen to drop some money into this and we can just forget all about it.
Minna: How much money will it take, out of character?
Rhi: Three coin.
Minna: Fuck. [laughs, fades to feigned whimpers] Looks at stash… [sighs]
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: So, are you gonna pay him off?
Minna: Yep.
Rhi: So, you drop a weighty purse of coin into his hand, and he kinda tosses it up and down a bit.
Minna: I think what that is, that’s all of her living money for the next little while, so she’s gonna have to sell off some shit to make up for it.
Rhi: Yeah. He tucks that away into his coat and is like:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Oh, sorry to have bothered you. It seems this was just a misunderstanding.
Rhi: He tips his cap, and the two of them exit. He shuts the door behind him. Whatever kind of calm you had at the end there is just completely shattered.
Minna: So, Myra is just gonna go home early, all freaked out.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yep. All right. And Minx?
Josie: While I’m laid up healing in bed, I’m writing a letter to Nyryx. Does that make sense?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: Just sort of explaining, you know, just what’s up in my life, and that I took a tumble but it’s no big deal, and that I’ve started talking to Bazso again, and we’re gonna keep talking about that, and boy has he not changed at all, and also just asking if we could have lunch again sometime soon.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. I think it’s one of those scenes where there’s the camera transition from you writing it to her sitting and reading it. There’s some street urchin who’s delivered the letter, and she just kind of smiles and folds it up, and very quickly scribbles out a reply and hands it to the kid. The reply just says, yes of course, and a time, date, and a place to meet up, then it’s signed ‘Love, N.’
Josie: Aw, yay.
Rhi: Okay. I think we’ll wrap up with Seeks.
Chris: I think it would be funny to be patching Minx up, and Minx has bullet wounds…
Chris (as Seeks): Phin did not heal nearly as much as you are. Why are you yelling so much?
Josie: [laughing] Yep. Fair enough. Minx is yelling.
Madge: While that’s going on, I picture Phin and Myra are like sitting outside, and Phin’s like:
Madge (as Phin): You know, I really like Seeks. We should keep her around.
Minna (as Myra): Less of a butcher than Sawtooth?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. He does judge us. Seeks does not judge us. You know?
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Seeks seems to have friends who do much worse than we do.
Madge (as Phin): Exactly. I mean, we can still go to Sawtooth if we absolutely have to, but…
Minna (as Myra): Are you suggesting we switch services?
Madge (as Phin): She did say Sawtooth overcharges us.
Minna (as Myra): Now that is a worry. I don’t have the coin to be getting overcharged.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Madge: Phin will get up and head over to the room where Minx is getting patched up, and she’ll knock on the doorframe.
Madge (as Phin): Mind if I butt in for a moment?
Chris (as Seeks): Uh, sure.
Madge (as Phin): Sure you mind, or sure it’s okay?
Josie (as Minx): Agh! [yelps]
Chris (as Seeks): If I kiss it will it make it better?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I do always appreciate kisses, but no, this is a little beyond that.
Chris: I think she smooches you on the face, and then you suddenly feel like you took a dose of Novocain.
Josie: What? [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Oh, oh… Oh dear.
Chris: I will mark 2 stress to use Venomous.
[laughter]
Josie: God damn it.
Rhi: You’re not unconscious. The pain has receded, and you’re just kinda like…
Minna: You basically have been trance powdered.
Rhi: Yeah.
Chris: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): That’s one… hell of a… gift.
Minna: A taste of your own medicine.
Chris (as Seeks): Yes. What’s up?
Madge (as Phin): We were thinking. We need a physician who doesn’t overcharge us and doesn’t ask too many questions. Are you in the market for new clients?
Chris: She shrugs.
Chris (as Seeks): That sounds fun.
Madge (as Phin): Cool. We’ll pay you fairly. You know… Yeah. Welcome to the team.
Madge: And she…. [laughs] I’m doing finger guns through the computer. It’s too awkward.
[laughter]
Minna: [swoons] Ah~! So cute!
Josie: Aww.
Chris: Her eyes get all sparkly.
Chris (as Seeks): Another team… I have two now…

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us and for continuing to listen. If you’ve already left us a review, thank you so, so much. If you haven’t yet, please consider doing so. It’s the best way to help new fans find the show.
Don’t forget to check out our new website. Visit MagpiesPodcast.net for cast bios, contact info, and character profiles with awesome art. In addition, Minna and I will be at Gen Con in like a week and a half, which is kind of terrifying—but exciting. We’re both really looking forward to it. If you’re going, let us know on Twitter. We would love to meet some of our fans. And if you meet up with me while you’re there, I will give you a cool Magpies bookmark.
Speaking of Twitter, this Saturday, July 28 2018, The Magpies will be recording our season 1 wrap-up episode. This episode and the end of season 1 won’t be going live until about October, but we wanna talk about all our feelings while they’re still fresh. So, what does this have to do with you and Twitter? Well, we’d like to answer some audience during this recording. So, go on Twitter and tweet all your burning questions about The Magpies to magpies_pod. We’ll pick a few to answer and discuss during the episode.
As you may have guessed from the title, today’s episode is a little different. Instead of another high-stakes, dramatic score, today The Magpies and the city of Duskwall are celebrating a holiday. We wanted to have a more character-focused, roleplay-centric episode, so we decided to give the crew a day off. This episode was a ton of fun to record, and I hope you enjoy listening to this one as much as we enjoyed creating it.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity.
My birthday was earlier this month, and so, for my birthday month, I’m focusing on an organization that’s very near and dear to me. The Glenwood Sunday Market is a farmer’s market based in the Rogers Park neighborhood on the north side of Chicago. In addition to supporting local farmers and new entrepreneurs with a variety of business programs, GSM has a commitment to food access for the community. In Rogers Park, over 20% of the residents use SNAP or other government benefits to feed themselves and their families. At the Market, we raise funds and apply for grants so that we can help those residents stretch their benefits even further and purchase fresh, local food that might otherwise not be affordable. This commitment to feeding the community is why I’ve been a volunteer with the Market for several years. However, as grants have been cut and donations have slowed, the Market is struggling. It’s not in danger of shutting down yet, but we’re trying to keep from getting to that point of desperation. So, I’m asking our listeners to visit the GSM website and make a donation if you’re able. If you prefer to keep your donation more local to your community, look up your local food pantries and make a monetary donation there. Food banks are often able to purchase food at steep discounts and spent the money on exactly what they need. With threatened cuts to SNAP looming, it’s more important than ever that we help feed our communities.
Speaking of threatened cuts to vital government benefits, if you’re in the United States, please also visit 5calls.org and call your representatives. Being loud and demanding and telling them over and over that we as citizens and voters expect our government to serve all people in our country is one of the best ways to bring about change.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## [00:03:44] Story resumes
Rhi: It’s been a couple weeks since your break-in at the Iruvian embassy; about a week since your theft at Dr. Hagen’s research clinic. Normally, this is about the time when you all would be starting to gear up for your next score, but instead, you all have opted to join in one of Duskwall’s major holidays: Doskvorn. This is a day to, basically, celebrate the birthday of everyone who was born in Duskwall. It is like having Christmas and your birthday combined, but in an awesome way, and not a disappointing way where your birthday gets overshadowed by a three-month holiday marketing juggernaut.
Kim and Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: So, you all have set out into the city. All of the different districts have their own way of celebrating. Brightstone and the nobility throw lavish balls; Barrowcleft has a massive feast for the community from all of the farmers; Six Towers, since there’s so few people living there, doesn’t really do much. But Nightmarket throws a district-wide street festival.
Minna: [delighted croon]
Rhi: Nearly every business in the district has its doors open and its prices lowered, and vendors from all across the city have set up stalls along the streets, crowding into any space they can find and selling food, drink, art, jewelry, books, fortunetelling, and more.
At this point, you all have started off your day of celebration at The Hound’s Paw to check in with your good friend Rigney, who is making an enormous amount of money. The place is packed. He’s got basically all of his staff in working to help take care of the crowd. But even with that, your table remains open and untouched, so the four of you are able to sit at your table and observe the crowds that have packed in here to celebrate.
Rigney, when you guys had come in, he’d waved at you over the crowd but hadn’t come over right away. After you have been there for a few minutes, he weaves his way through the crowd with a large tray; a little bit larger than normal from when he brings over your drinks. He balances the tray on one arm and distributes your drinks—but he also gives each of you a paper-wrapped package, and tucks the tray under his arm and gives you all a big grin.
Rhi (as Rigney): Really glad you all made it in here today. It just wouldn’t have been the same, giving you all your Doskvorn presents a day late.
Kim (as Blaire): Aw, thank you!
Josie (as Minx): Aw, dear, you shouldn’t have.
Rhi: He just kinda shrugs. Blaire, I will say, this might be the first time you’ve gotten a present for Doskvorn, because it’s not a holiday that you celebrate in Tycheros.
Kim: Yeah, ‘cause I wasn’t born here.
Rhi: Yeah. And since you’ve been living here, you haven’t really had any family who would’ve gotten you gifts, so…
Josie: Aww!
Kim: Oh, Rigney!
Madge: Aww!
Minna: Did any of us get Rigney a Doskvorn present?
Madge: Phin did.
Kim: Blaire immediately starts scribbling on a napkin, probably, like, a really cute smiley face or something like that. She’s gonna give it to Rigney later.
Rhi: [laugh] Madge, did you say that Phin had gotten him something?
Madge: Yeah. She got him a new vest to put all of his pins and stuff on, and it has extra pockets on the inside.
Rhi: Is it wrapped up or anything, or is it just, here is a vest?
Madge: It’s in a bag. [laughter]
Rhi: [laughter] Okay.
Madge: With a ribbon on it.
Rhi: When you give that to him, he looks surprised, and he’s like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, well! Thank you! Should– should I open this now, or…
Madge (as Phin): Uh, if you want to. You don’t have to. I just… You know. You’re part of the crew, kind of, so…
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, the part of the crew that doesn’t go out and get horribly injured all the time.
Rhi: And looks at Blaire and Minx.
Kim (as Blaire): I heard that!
Rhi: Since I think they were the most… Well, it’s a worried look. He’s just like [sad noise].
Kim (as Blaire): It’s fine!
Josie (as Minx): To be fair, you were the only reason we know where to go get horribly maimed, and we thank you for that profusely.
Rhi: He does that thing where he raises a finger and opens his mouth like he’s gonna protest, then just shakes his head and closes it, and goes to open up the gift and takes it out.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, this is fantastic. Thank you so much. And you should—
Rhi: He glances around, and then:
Rhi (as Rigney): Ah, they can all wait. You should open yours.
Madge (as Phin): All right.
Madge: I will open mine, then. [laugh]
Josie: Minx will daintily unfold and undo the bow, if there is one.
Kim: Blaire is ravenously just opening her—
Josie: [laughing] Aww.
Rhi: [laughing] They’re all wrapped with brown butcher paper; it is not anything fancy. But I do really love the idea of Minx just very delicately unwrapping it.
Josie: No, she’s like, using a letter opener to cut where it’s folded, and— [laugh]
Rhi: Oh my God.
Kim: Noooo! Blaire is just going at it.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. All right, Phin: Rigney has gotten you a pair of fingerless gloves that have a steel band bolted down across the knuckles.
Madge: Yay, punch gloves.
Rhi: Myra, he has gotten you a book on codes and ciphers and code breaking.
Minna: Ooh!
Rhi: Blaire, for you, it’s a small, metal tin, that when you open it up, you immediately recognize the scent from the dried leaves inside—this is tea that is imported from Tycheros.
Kim: Aww!
Minna: Ah!
Kim: Rigney!
Josie: He’s so thoughtful.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: And for Minx, you have a small, wooden box that contains a set of very fine silk handkerchiefs with an ‘M’ embroidered in the corner.
Madge: [gasp]
Josie (as Minx): Oh my goodness. Goodness gracious, Rigney, thank you.
Josie: She’s gonna fold one up and insert it into her breast pocket.
Madge and Rhi: [laughter]
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, you are all very welcome. And now, I do need to get back to work before my bar gets completely overrun. Have a good day. Don’t stick around in here the whole time, get out and see the festival.
Rhi: He gives you all a big grin and a wave, and works his way back to the crowd, to the bar.
Josie (as Minx): I must say, this is the most pleasant start to a day, I believe, we’ve had in a very long time.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, it’s very kind of him. We should get him a gift.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, I’ve already got one.
Minna (as Myra): Phin, I know that you did– Sorry?
Kim (as Blaire): I’ve already got one!
Kim: Blaire holds up a napkin, and it’s a very crude drawing of a cartoon ghost with a smiley face.
Josie: [laughing] Aww!
Madge: Aww.
Kim: That says “thank you.”
Josie: Blaire is so precious. Aww!
Minna: He might even frame it and put it on one of the walls here.
Kim: [overcome] Awwww!
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I was intending to find some sort of glass or vintage amongst the stalls today, so if we find anything of that nature, I’m interested.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I’ll keep an eye out.
Rhi: So, you guys wanna hang around in here for a while or head on out?
Josie: Let’s head on out.
Kim: Yeah, I think it’s time we head out.
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: Is this our first Doskvorn together, as a group?
Rhi: I think so.
Madge: I think for the whole crew, definitely. I think Myra and Phin have had at least one together before bringing everyone else in.
Rhi: Yeah.
When you guys step back out onto the street outside The Hound’s Paw, you are overwhelmed with light and sound and the smells of food and drink. The streets are illuminated, not just by the normal street lamps, but by strings of tiny, glass lights colored red and blue and green. Carnival games have been set up in some of the alleys, offering prizes for those with skill at dart throwing or ring toss. There are entertainers demonstrating fire-breathing and sword juggling and acrobatics.
Looking in one direction down the street, you can see, above the crowd, cracks of electroplasmic lightning as some of the Sparkwrights show of their latest inventions. And, in the other direction, you can hear inhuman roars and bellows coming from the cages where captured Deathlands monsters can be viewed.
And packed in every inch of the street is the massive crowd of people—children rushing from attraction to attraction while their parents give chase, teenagers on their own for the first time spending their own money, lovers walking arm in arm; anybody with money to spend and a desire to indulge themselves, just for a day.
So, you’ve got this whole street festival to explore. Where do you wanna start?
## [00:12:51]
Josie: I do get the sense that our younger compatriot here might have a few ideas where to go, given that it’s her first.
Kim: Um… Oh, man. Blaire’s eyes dart around all the booths and sights. She’s almost overwhelmed, but not in a negative way; she’s just in awe and still taking everything in. She wants to do it all, basically.
Josie and Myra: [laughter]
Kim: But she’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): Um, um, uh, how about a game? I wanna do a carnival game.
Josie: Do they have one of the test your strength things?
Rhi: Oh, like the thing you hit with a big hammer?
Josie: Yes.
Kim: [gasp]
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, they definitely have one of those.
Kim (as Blaire): Phin. Phin, Phin, Phin!
Josie (as Minx): Phin, Phin!
Madge (as Phin): [laughing] Fine. All right. I’ll do that one.
Rhi: In an alley a street or so down from The Hound’s Paw, a number of carnival games have been set up. One of them is the test your strength thing, and… Oh, I gotta think of prizes. What do we think prizes would be?
Josie: Hmm.
Kim: Oh, what about, uh… What kind of non-perishable food is really hard to come by in Duskwall? Something that people would really try to get their hands on, like a rare meat or some kind of plant-based food that’s really hard to get.
Minna: Dried fruit.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking, is that it’s a packet of dried mushrooms and probably some other, more common dried foodstuff, but there’s also a few pieces of dried fruit mixed in.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: It’s Duskwall trail mix. [laughter]
Kim: Shit!
Josie: [laughter]
Kim: You’re right.
Josie, Kim, and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. Varying sizes of those are available to win at the test your strength thing. Also, then, further down the alley, there’s a ring toss and dart throwing and that kind of stuff. But yeah, Phin, do you wanna try your luck at the testing your strength thing?
Madge: Yeah. What would I roll for that?
Rhi: I would say you could do Skirmish or Wreck, although Wreck does come with the threat that you could break this guy’s machine.
Madge: I am willing to take that risk.
Rhi: [laughter] All right.
Kim: And what does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Minna and Rhi: [laughter]
Madge: She really wants to show off. Okay, 5.
Rhi: God, these are usually on the meter of one to 100, right?
Kim: Mhmm.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Something like that, yeah. So, I think you… Well, describe how Phin readies up for this massive hammer swing.
Madge: [laugh] All right. I think it starts off with her sauntering up to the booth, then looking at the guy in charge, and then looking at the hammer that they use for it. She puts down however much coin is needed for it, takes the hammer, and tries to make a show out of making it look like it’s not that heavy at all, before taking it in both hands and just overhead swinging it.
Rhi: The hammer head crashes down on the thing, and the meter flies up to 100—and then stays there.
Madge: Oh no.
Rhi: The target that you hit is stuck down there. The guy doesn’t notice that right away. He’s like:
Rhi (as The Guy): Oh, wow! Well, here you go!
Rhi: And he pulls down the large bag of dried fruit trail mix and hands it over. Then he looks, and:
Rhi (as The Guy): Ah, crap.
Rhi: And leans down to start trying to pry the thing up from the base.
Rhi (as The Guy): A little less force next time, ma’am. [grunt]
Josie, Madge, and Rhi: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Does this happen often?
Madge (as Phin): Well, there’s a reason I’m called Bricks, so…
Madge and Rhi: [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): I do not believe Phin knows any other way to be.
Rhi: [laughter]
Madge (as Phin): I know a couple other ways to be.
Josie: [laughter]
Minna (as Myra): They should build the machines better.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Madge: She’s gonna hand the bag over to Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasp]
Rhi: Aww.
Kim (as Blaire): Well… But you won it!
Madge (as Phin): You know, happy Doskvorn.
Kim: Aww! Blaire’s actually starting to get overwhelmed now. She doesn’t know what to do with people being this nice. She’s gotten so many gifts!
Josie (as Minx): Do not fret so much over it. We just want to ensure that you have a good time on your first.
Kim (as Blaire): [overcome] Oh, okay…
Josie: [laughter]
Madge: I would dote on my sisters just as much. So…
Kim (as Blaire): [gasp] Oh– Wait– Wha–? You…
Josie, Kim, Madge, and Rhi: [laughter]
Kim: I think you broke her.
Madge: Oh no!
Minna: Hug the girl. [laugh]
Kim (as Blaire): Y– [tearful gasp] You think I’m a sister?
Madge (as Phin): Well, yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): [nearly crying noises]
Madge (as Phin): A gang’s like a family, so…
Kim (as Blaire): [tearfully] Okay.
Madge (as Phin): Let’s just go do something else before I get sappy.
Josie, Madge, Minna, and Rhi: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): [overcome] O– Okay.
Josie (as Minx): I must say, Phin, that’s… reassuring to hear from you. I know how protective you are of family.
Madge (as Phin): Thanks. Yeah. Um, so—
Kim: I think we’re dropping it now.
Rhi: [laughing] I think Phin is like, “I’m done with feelings!”
Madge: Uh, I’m, I’m gonna… Is there a tattoo parlor around here, maybe, please?
Rhi: Most of the tattoo artists work up in the docks, but a couple of them… Well, ‘cause vendors from all over the city come to the street festival ‘cause they can make a ton of money. So, I think that, yeah, there’s a couple tattoo artists who have little outdoor stands where they’re doing tattoos on people.
Madge: Mhmm.
Josie: Similar vein: is there face paint?
Kim: [gasp]
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Ooh, I think Minx wants to get face paint of, like, a masquerade mask.
Madge: Ooh.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: But it’s face paint, so it’s just always on.
Rhi: I think there’s some enterprising face paint artist who has set up near the tattoo artists so that the kids who are like, “I wanna get a cool tattoo!” can be redirected to face paint by their parents.
Kim: Oh, there you go.
Josie: Aww.
Kim: That’s cute.
Josie: That’s perfect.
Kim: Blaire is gonna tag along. She wants… Is there a way I can convince the face painter to do what I normally do with my, for lack of a better word, face makeup, where I just smear stuff all over my eyes? But instead of like black or brown or whatever, I do festival colors?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, if you’re paying money, they will do whatever you want.
Kim (as Blaire): Just fuck me up.
Josie, Madge, Minna, and Rhi: [pause] [bursting laughter]
Madge: There’s a mom who covers their child’s ears.
Josie: Yeah.
Everyone: [laughter]
Kim: Blaire belatedly realizes, then she looks over her shoulders and is like:
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, uh, sorry!
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah, you two can get face paint.
Minna: I think Myra’s just gonna tag along with Phin.
Rhi: Yeah. They’re not too far away from each other, so you guys are still in visual range. So yeah, what’s happening over at the tattoo stand?
Madge: Phin’s gonna get a tattoo of a magpie in flight on her right hand, in the curve between her thumb and pointer finger.
Josie: Oh, wow.
Madge: Like, on the back of her hand.
Rhi: So, pretty small?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, I’m just trying to gauge how long that would take.
Madge: And she’s not going detailed, she’s just going rough outline.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you can do that. You’re probably gonna be sitting there for a good 20 minutes, probably. So, Myra, are you hanging out?
Minna: Yeah. I think she’s just chatting with Phin to take her mind off the tattoo.
Rhi: [laughter]
Madge: [laughing] Yeah.
Madge (as Phin): Do you think I overdid it giving her the trail mix?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think you overdid it. I think she really appreciated it.
Madge (as Phin): Okay. Okay, you know, ‘cause she looked like she was about to pass out.
Minna (as Myra): It’s her first Doskvorn and I think this is a time when everyone’s a little bit… Well, you know how it gets on Doskvorn, right?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Our last Doskvorn was super sappy, so…
Minna (as Myra): I mean, it’s nice to have family, I guess.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Home away from home.
Minna (as Myra): She might be feeling the same way, if she doesn’t have–
Madge (as Phin): I don’t think we’ve ever asked her about her family at all.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. I guess I never thought about it. I mean, it’s not like I talk about it either.
Madge (as Phin): We don’t talk a lot about anything.
Minna (as Myra): We talk about day to day stuff, we just don’t talk about the past a lot. Or, stuff outside the gang. I guess… I don’t know, maybe we should ask her about that.
Madge (as Phin): It’s all strictly business. I agree, we should start talking to them more. It’s been, like, a couple months.
Minna (as Myra): I think you’re right. It’s more like a family, and we probably should stop treating it like it’s just business.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Minna: Sidebar? “Our last Doskvorn was super sappy?” What happened?
Madge and Rhi: [laughter]
Rhi: [gasp] Did Phin bring Myra back home—
Madge: [quietly] [gasp] Oh, fuck!
Rhi: For dinner with the family?
Kim: Oh…!
Josie: [gasp]
Minna: [whisper screaming]
Madge: Yeah, she definitely did.
Rhi: [overcome] Oh, gosh.
Kim: [overcome noises] Aww!
Minna: Yeah, that was super sappy, then. [delighted laugh]
Rhi: Oh, that’s wonderful.
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna be like:
Minna (as Myra): So, why didn’t you go to your family this Doskvorn?
Madge (as Phin): Um… [haltingly] I haven’t really gone home since the embassy thing.
Minna (as Myra): Not at all?
Madge (as Phin): Nope.
Minna (as Myra): I mean, you hear from them, though, right?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. I write sometimes, to let them know I’m not dead.
Minna (as Myra): I mean, I’m not questioning you, I’m just… It seems a little out of character for you.
Madge (as Phin): I don’t want them to know what happened, and, you know, Aldric has a way of figuring things out, so…
Minna (as Myra): I mean, either they’re gonna find out about it from you or from somebody else, or you’re just going to keep not seeing them forever?
Madge (as Phin): I’m gonna not see them until I figure out a way to lie about it.
Minna (as Myra): I mean, you know some people who are pretty good at lying, Phin.
Madge (as Phin): That’s true. Let’s table that.
Minna (as Myra): We’ll table that. We’ll talk about it later.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
## [00:22:43]
Rhi: All right. I think on that, we’ll cut back over to Blaire and Minx, who I think both have their face paint done now.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Mhmm. Mine’s a fancy, intricate mask, and hers is smears of color across.
Kim: Yup.
Rhi: The face paint artist with Blaire was trying to do a pattern, and then Blaire looked in the mirror and just smeared the pattern away, and is like “yeah, perfect!”
Kim: Yeah. Yeah, and meanwhile, the artist just kinda died inside a little.
Rhi: Just kind of like:
Rhi (as Artist): [dejectedly] Okay…
Rhi: [laugh]
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, since family does seem to be a topic on the brains of all of us lately: I know you came here for school, correct?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I mean, I got kicked out, but…
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Uh…
Kim (as Blaire): [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Never been one much for schooling, myself. But what was your life before that? I’ve only known of Blaire the student.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. Okay, um, well, I grew up in Tycheros. Um, and my family were alchemists… Um… And, I mean, I don’t know. It was pretty normal.
Josie (as Minx): Are you ever in contact with them at all?
Kim (as Blaire): [grunt] Um, I can’t, really, no. [sigh]
Josie (as Minx): There’s no way to send a letter?
Kim (as Blaire): Well… [sigh] There are some ways, but it’s not easy, and, just… The other thing is, I don’t think they know that, um, I dropped out of school, so…
Josie (as Minx): Ah. Hmm…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. It’s– it’s tough, because I really miss them. Sometimes I really wish I could go back home. But… [sigh] I don’t really know how to justify what I got myself into.
Josie (as Minx): Well, far be it for me to dictate anything, and, gods forbid, I know very little of “parenting” from either side of the equation, but surely they know of your proclivities and would understand what happened, at the very least? I doubt they would attempt in any way to make your situation worse.
Kim (as Blaire): Well… [sigh] If they find out what I did, they might actually… I don’t know if they’d punish me, or… But they may not be happy with me, you know? I mean… [sigh] I think they alway– I mean, they obviously loved me, but I think they always kind of thought I was a little weird.
Josie (as Minx): I must say, you are very kind and, frankly, normal person, from my standing—despite certain interests.
Kim (as Blaire): Think so?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. You approach it very… I suppose it’s very idealistic. I don’t wish to provoke a philosophical discussion, but I am put off by certain ghostly activities. But you approach it with a very kind heart.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww, thanks. That means a lot, Minx. Do you really think that Phin thinks I’m her sister?
Josie (as Minx): I feel like, and I may not be speaking for Myra here, but for both Phin and myself—I don’t know, it does seem to be some sort of fraternal bond we share.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww… See, no, because I’m not opposed to that, it just kind of caught me off guard, ‘cause, you know, I wasn’t expecting it. And it’s really sweet, but, you know, gonna make me miss my own sister.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, you have a sister?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I have a twin sister.
Josie (as Minx): What?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Oh! Then surely, at least, she would understand.
Kim (as Blaire): I think she would, yeah. I’m just… I’m mostly worried about my parents.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): But she would have my back, I think.
Josie (as Minx): I’m hardly one to talk when it comes to actions that might alienate those you care about, but my advice might be to, if it would be alienating, to proceed through it so that amends can be made—
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know.
Josie (as Minx): And leaving that bit uncertain. I feel a bit of a hypocrite saying that, but…
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, well, hm. I’m perhaps the reason we are not so on the ins with Bazso. I don’t think I’ve ever explained my previous crew, have I?
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Josie (as Minx): You remember Nyryx, yes?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie: Also, I might suggest that this might be a good time for the groups to join back up?
Kim: [laughter]
## [00:26:43]
Rhi: I like the idea of, Minx is explaining this and the other two just come up behind her.
Josie: Yeah, and it’s just like, “wait, hold on.” [laughter]
Madge and Rhi: [laughter]
Rhi: Phin has some bandages on her hand to protect the new tattoo.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, sick. What did you get?
Madge (as Phin): Uh, magpie.
Kim (as Blaire): Nice!
Madge (as Phin): Yeah!
Minna (as Myra): It looks really nice.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I was just explaining, because, apparently, it wasn’t entirely clear that Bazso, Nyryx, and I used to run together when we were but children on the streets.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Madge (as Phin): You were on the streets?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, uh, ahem, hm. Uh, yes. I don’t particularly like mentioning that fact. But when we were growing up, we would run together and look out for each other. I must admit some indiscretions on my part caused a bit of alienation, but we do still talk, and I count myself lucky for that.
Kim (as Blaire): Hm.
Josie (as Minx): But anyway, I was just advising Blaire from that situation of, perhaps, hypocrisy.
Kim (as Blaire): Ooh, roast nuts!
Kim: Blaire’s gonna walk away. [laughter]
Josie: [laughing] Roast nuts.
Rhi: Yes, there is someone selling Duskwall equivalent of roasted chestnuts, or something. Nearby the chestnut stand, it’s a fortuneteller’s shop. It’s one of the few doors that’s closed on the street; most of the shops just have the doors propped open so people can come in a little more easily. But this one is closed, and there’s a sign on the door that says “knock before entering.”
Kim: Blaire catches sight of this and she is in the middle of almost shoving a handful of nuts into her mouth.
Josie: [laughter]
Kim: And she just freezes and probably let her tube drop to the ground. She’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, my gods. We have to try this! We have to look!
Josie (as Minx): Well, that’s delightfully quaint and ominous.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah!
Kim: I think she’s gonna grab Myra’s wrist and just tug her along and bring her through.
Minna and Rhi: [giggling]
Josie: Aww!
Minna: She’s fine with this.
Rhi: Do all four of you go together?
Madge: Yeah, all going.
Josie: Yeah, let’s all do this.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Could be fun.
Rhi: I assume Blaire knocks on the door?
Kim: Mhmm.
Rhi: Probably very eagerly and loudly.
Kim: Yeah. She probably knocks like eight times; like, very rapid succession.
Rhi: There’s a brief pause, and then you hear a:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Enter.
Rhi: You open the door, and it’s a single room. Two of the walls are lined with these thick, purple curtains, and the other two walls are full of shelves that hold all kinds of arcane bric-a-brac, for lack of a better description.
Kim (as Blaire): [awed gasp]
Rhi: There’s books and jars full of weird substances and crystals, and weird little trinkets scattered haphazardly around. In the middle of the room, there is a round table with a purple tablecloth over it. On the side closest to the door, where you’re all coming in, there are four chairs in a half circle. And opposite you, there’s a woman sitting in one chair. She looks like she’s probably Severosi; dark skin, dark hair that is cut pretty short. She is wearing a beautifully tailored, deep red gown. It’s got a broad sort of square collar, so it cuts a little lower. You can see, going from here collarbone down below the hem of the collar, there’s this thick scar; looks like it might have come from a blade or a claw, maybe. She is shuffling a deck of cards when you come in. She looks up and smiles, and says:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Ah, I was wondering when you would arrive. Please, have a seat.
Rhi: And keeps shuffling.
Kim (as Blaire): You knew we were coming?
Rhi: She just shrugs.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): It’s my business to know things before they happen, darling.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispering] Wow.
Josie: I do believe that Blaire spontaneously combusts with emotion; this is when it happens.
Rhi: [laughter]
Kim: Oh, this is her shit! She wants to buy everything in this place.
Rhi: Do you all sit down?
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Mhmm.
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: Mhmm.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): My name is Nyelle. I am a teller of fortunes.
Minna (as Myra): Do we need to tell you our names? [laugh]
Madge (as Phin): Probably knows our names.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, oh, oh! What’s my name?
Rhi: Lemma make a fortune roll [dice clattering] and see if she knows it. Hang on.
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: She studies you for a moment, cocks her head to the side, and is like:
Rhi (as Nyelle): Ah… Ah, your name evokes wind, the air…
Josie: Can I, without Blaire noticing, mouth “Blaire” to the fortuneteller person?
Kim: [bursting laughter] Oh, that’s precious!
Minna: [giggle]
Rhi: Yeah. You’re gonna have to make some kind of roll to do it without Blaire noticing, though.
Josie: Sure.
Kim: Oh my gosh. This is the best.
Josie: Darn.
Kim: [Disappointedly] Aww.
Rhi: Yeah, you mouth it, but Blaire notices.
Josie: Aww. [laugh]
Rhi (as Nyelle): I nearly had it. Now, then, would you each like an individual reading, or a reading as a group?
Josie (as Minx): I think individual, at least for our younger cohort.
Kim (as Blaire): I think everyone should do individual. You guys should all do it. I’ve been reading up a little bit about tarot; it’s really cool. You guys could learn a lot.
Rhi: She looks to Myra and Phin; sort of a questioning look of, “are you interested?”
Minna (as Myra): Certainly.
Madge (as Phin): I’d love to.
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: She shuffles through the cards. She starts by dealing out three cards in front of Blaire. The first is the King of Void, the second is Judgement in reverse, and the third is the Nine of Void in reverse. She looks at the cards and strokes her chin for a moment, and says:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Hm, well, it seems that in the past—
Rhi: She touches the King of Void.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): You have faced someone in your life who is distant and cold, and gives you bad advice; leads you astray. And this has brought you to the present, here.
Rhi: She touches the Judgement card.
Kim (as Blaire): Mhmm.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Where you are feeling a lot of doubt and lack of self-awareness. But I see… I see hope in your future.
Rhi: She taps the Nine of Void.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): There is a path, though, to me, the path is clouded. But there is a path before you to satisfaction, emotional stability, even a life of luxury. But I believe that you must overcome this doubt that has been brought about by this person in your life who is leading you astray.
Kim (as Blaire): I have no idea who that could be.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Well, you’ll have to figure out who that is first before you can make any progress forward.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, I’m afraid I have a confession.
Rhi: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Josie (as Minx): [laughter] I’m simply jesting, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay. Well, uh, thank you.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Mhmm.
Rhi: She takes the cards back, shuffles them again, and looks to Minx.
Josie: Excellent.
Rhi: She plays out another three cards in front of Minx. The first is the Soul, the second is the Seven of Blood—
Josie: That’s a really rad suit.
Minna: Mhmm!
Rhi: The last is the Ten of Void in reverse. She contemplates, and she says:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Well, for you…
Rhi: She taps the Seven of Blood and says:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): I see in your past a lot of defensiveness and a need for control, and that has led you here—
Rhi: She touches the Soul.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): To a life of materialism, addiction, but also playfulness and openness. It’s not all dark. But there are things about that that are holding you back from—
Rhi: And, on this, she touches the Ten of Void.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): For this, in order for you to achieve inner happiness and fulfill your dreams, you need to, like your friend here, work through some of these things in your present and from your past that are holding you back from this future happiness.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I don’t know about you all, but I would not classify myself as materialistic at all.
Madge (as Phin): [snort] Mhmm.
Josie and Rhi: [laughter]
Rhi: I think—
Josie (as Minx): [laughing] Jesting. You’re good at what you do, madame.
Rhi: Then she looks at Myra. She plays out, all upright, first the Tower, then the Two of Blood, and then the King of Blood. When the Tower comes up, she frowns a little bit and says:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Ah, I see that there was a sudden disaster in your past; something that you couldn’t have predicted and couldn’t have prepared for that changed you profoundly, that led you to where you are now.
Rhi: On this, she touches the Two of Blood.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): You plan and make decisions. Some of those decisions led you leave home and strike out on your own. And I see, in your future—
Rhi: On this, she touches the King of Blood.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): You have a vision of the greater picture. You will overcome challenges, perhaps even emerge as a leader, and I believe that for all the difficult decisions and upheaval in your past, that has helped make you into a person who could accomplish such things.
Minna: I think Myra’s just looking, frowning and thoughtful, at this point. I don’t think she necessarily gives her a direct reaction or questions anything. She’s just kind of taking it in.
Rhi: All right. Then she takes the cards back, shuffles them in again, and turns to Phin. She plays out first the Knight of Void in reverse, then the Two of Blades, also in reverse, and then the Leviathan, upright.
Madge: [gasp]
Josie: That’s a rad arcana.
Minna: Mhmm!
Madge: [laugh]
Kim: Right?
Josie: Shit.
Rhi: She studies the cards for a moment, and:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Seems that you—
Rhi: She touches the Knight of Void.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Have come from a great idealism. You follow your heart and your principles, but this idealism and your principles have led you to where you find yourself now—
Rhi: She touches the Two of Blades.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Where you feel confused, like there’s no right choice, like you’re forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. But as you find yourself facing these difficult choices, you must keep in mind—
Rhi: She touches the Leviathan.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): That while you may face difficult choices and changes, everything happens in a cycle. Things live; they die; things live again. And in some ways, our fate is inevitable. While some may struggle against it, sometimes there is comfort in knowing that whatever choice you make, it will lead to the end that you were meant to reach.
Madge (as Phin): So, remember I will die. Got it.
Minna: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): No– No, that doesn’t—
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Well, I suppose that’s one perspective on it.
Rhi: She takes the cards back shuffles them in.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Well, I hope that that provided some help and guidance to you all.
Rhi: She pauses for a moment and glances up past you, and says:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Ah, I have a newly married couple on their way in, so if you don’t mind, it’s a very busy day for me. Normally I would love to stay and talk about this a bit more, but I do need to keep my customers moving.
Kim (as Blaire): Aw. You have a business card?
Rhi: She laughs a little bit and stands up and goes over to one of the shelves, and scrawls something out on a piece of paper and hands it to you. It just says “Fortunes by Nyelle,” and has the address.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): You’re very welcome, young Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasp] [whispering] She knows my name!
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Then, I think, as you all stand up to leave, there’s a knock at the door, and she says:
Rhi (as Fortuneteller): Oh, just a moment.
Rhi: When you step outside, there is indeed a pair of young women standing there holding hands and giggling to each other.
Madge: Cute.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: What else do you guys wanna do in this street festival?
Josie (as Minx): That was, perhaps, more of a sobering experience than I was expecting. Shall we continue with the jollier side of things?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Can I not focus on my imminent death?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, um, that’s– Doesn’t necessarily mean that.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure your death isn’t that imminent.
Madge (as Phin): Well, yeah, but inevitable. I want something sweet. Just—
Josie (as Minx): Sweets! Delightful.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Let’s go for it.
Kim: Does Blades have ice cream? Does that exist?
Madge: Do we have cows?
Rhi: There are goats.
Madge: Okay.
Rhi: Let me… Give me a moment. There is a whole three page spread in the book about food.
Kim: What?!
Minna: What’s There to Eat in Duskwall? I love that spread so much.
Josie: [chuckle]
Rhi: I do not think that there are cows. I don’t think cows survived the breaking of the world. There are goats—
Minna: Can you make goats’ milk ice cream?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. I think you could do that. So, I think that’s not an everyday kind of thing that you guys would be able to afford, but on a special occasion you probably could get some goats’ milk ice cream.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: You guys have to wander for a little bit to find a place that will sell ice cream, but you’re able to find it because there is a line stretching halfway down a block that consists primarily of children.
Kim: Oh, God.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: Eventually, you guys get up there. You’re waiting for the last group of people in front of you to get their orders. It’s a small family; there’s a woman in a wheelchair, a young woman, and then two younger boys. The young woman puts some money down, takes very small cups of ice cream, and hands them out.
Rhi (as Young Woman): Okay, this is for you, and this is for you.
Rhi: Handing them out to the boys. As she turns, you recognize that this is Nessa Ericks—
Josie and Minna: [gasp]
Rhi: The artist from the art theft that you all did quite some time ago. She turns and sees you all, and is like:
Rhi (as Nessa): Oh! Oh, hello! Um—
Josie (as Minx): Oh, Ms. Ericks, my dear, how have you been?
Rhi (as Nessa): Um, pretty well.
Rhi: She herds the boys off to the side so that you guys can move in to put in your orders.
Rhi (as Nessa): I’ve been doing pretty good. Oh, these are my brothers, and this is my mother.
Rhi: The woman in the wheelchair gives you a wave with the hand isn’t holding ice cream.
Rhi (as Mama Ericks): Nessa, these some new friends of yours?
Rhi: And is looking a little suspicious.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, no. We’ve simply crossed paths a few times before.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re fans!
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi: Nessa leans down.
Rhi (as Nessa): They helped me with that whole, um, situation a couple months ago.
Rhi: And her mom’s eyes go wide.
Rhi (as Mama Ericks): Oh. Oh! That’s you– Oh, I’m so sorry. It’s so good to meet you! And thank you so much for what you did.
Kim (as Blaire): Of course.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, it was hardly anything at all.
Rhi: I think at this point Nessa notices Phin.
Rhi (as Nessa): Oh, I’m so sorry. I– I’ve gotten so flustered. I don’t think we’ve met. I’m Nessa Ericks.
Madge (as Phin): Nice to meet you. Phin Haig.
Rhi: She shakes your hand.
Rhi (as Nessa): Yeah, I’ve been doing well, just back at stocking at the shop that I was working at before, but—
Josie (as Minx): Back to the grindstone, as one might say.
Rhi (as Nessa): Yeah. Well, it doesn’t pay as much, but, you know, comes with considerably fewer risks.
Rhi: She looks down at her ice cream.
Josie (as Minx): I can imagine so. But at least you are able to still enjoy a happy Doskvorn.
Rhi (as Nessa): Yeah. I managed to sell a painting a couple weeks ago—
Kim (as Blaire): Yay!
Rhi (as Nessa): And saved up the money so that I could treat everybody.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent.
Rhi: I think at this point the shop owner is like:
Rhi (as Shop Owner): [clears throat] Much as I hate to interrupt this reunion, the line goes down the block in both directions, so either order your ice cream or move on.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course.
Rhi (as Nessa): Oh, yeah, sorry. We should get going. But it was really good to see you again.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. And please do come calling if you find yourself seeking something to break the grind.
Rhi (as Nessa): I’ll keep that in mind.
Rhi: She nods. Her brothers have started trying to steal each other’s ice cream, and she’s just like:
Rhi (as Nessa): Stop it! Stop that! Come on.
Rhi: And herds them out. Her mom starts to wheel herself out and gives you all another big smile, and just mouths “thank you” again. Then they head off into the crowd.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: You all get your ice cream. I don’t know that there’s necessarily different flavors for sale here. I think flavors of ice cream are something that would be out of your price range.
Kim: What about toppings?
Rhi: What would you put on ice cream?
Josie: Nuts?
Kim: Candy? Maybe dried fruit, if you have all the money.
Josie: We do have dried fruit, though.
Kim: [gasp]
Rhi: Yeah! Oh yeah, you guys can put… Yeah, you have your trail mix you can put on top of the ice cream. There you go.
Josie: Perfect.
Rhi: Yeah. you guys put some of the dried fruit and trail mix stuff on top.
Josie: Of course, only if Blaire’s okay with sharing.
Kim: Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Rhi: You guys walk a little ways away from the place, to where the crowd isn’t quite as thick.
Madge: Nice.
Josie: Have I ever had ice cream before? I don’t think I’ve ever been able to shell out for it.
Rhi: Yeah, probably not.
Josie (Minx): Blaire, is this your first time?
Kim: Is it?
Rhi: Blaire, I would say that you probably have had some kind of ice cream type thing before.
Kim: It’s probably just been a long time.
Rhi: Yeah, ‘cause your family was pretty middle class. But not since you left home.
Kim: Okay, so getting back to Minx’s question:
Kim (as Blaire): No. No, I’ve kinda had something like this before, but it’s been a long time.
Madge (as Phin): No, I’ve never had it either. So…
Josie (as Minx): I see. Myra, we haven’t engaged in an activity for your pleasure yet.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! What do you wanna do?
Minna (as Myra): Been having fun so far. [laugh]
Josie: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, come on! What do you wanna do? Live a little!
Rhi: [laugh] I’m picturing Blaire just shaking her shoulder, like, rock her back and forth.
Josie: Aww.
Minna: Myra is like:
Minna (as Myra): ‘Live a little…’
Minna: She looks directly at the ice cream she’s holding, and back at Blaire, like:
Minna (as Myra): Is this not living?
Josie and Rhi: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): But, but, this is a day for all of us. What about something for you?
Josie (as Minx): Surely Myra Keel must be able to cut loose in some fashion.
Minna: I honestly think it might be fun to just do a simple thing that would hark back to childhood, ‘cause Doskvorn is a lot about that. Just a ring toss or something could be cool. She’s not good at it, but it’s fun.
Rhi: You can definitely do that; very easy to find. A lot of people who don’t own a shop but wanna make some money on Doskvorn tend to set up carnival games, ‘cause it’s pretty cheap, you can set it up anywhere, and it’s very popular.
Minna: Mhmm. I think they’re all staring at her, and she glances over and spots ring toss.
Minna (as Myra): Why don’t we go do that?
Josie (as Minx): Delightful. We shall.
Rhi: You guys head across the street. I think the prizes here are… Hmm. I’m trying to decide. I think that it’s a variety of little stuffed animals. Some of them are just cats and dogs, but some of them are Deathlands creatures that should not be cute and cuddly.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasp]
Rhi: One of the top tier prizes is a little stuffed bear. Its fur is an ashy gray color, and it has red eyes. The owner is demonstrating to a couple of teenagers who are over there. The mouth is on a hinge and it opens up, and red fabric that looks like flame is in there that comes out.
Josie: [laughter]
Kim: Aww, that is so cute.
Rhi: It’s a fire-breathing ash bear. As you get over there, you hear her say:
Rhi (as Owner): The fur on this is from a real ash bear pelt. That’s why you have to score so high to win it.
Rhi: She puts it back. There’s also some crows, which is really morbid. But they have them.
Kim: [gasp]
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: It’s the worst thing. [laugh] There’s also some stuffed—what look like—panthers. The fur on this is gray and black. They have exaggeratedly large fabric claws and fangs. Then there’s just a selection of cute little stuffed cats and dogs and stuff. Blaire, you wanted to roll something to see if you could figure out if she was lying?
Kim: Yeah. I feel like Blaire would know whether or not she’s bullshitting.
Rhi: Well, you can try to do it, but I do not think Blaire has encountered an ash bear in the wild, because if she had, Blaire probably wouldn’t be alive.
Kim: Oh. Well—
Rhi: My inspiration for ash bears is: take a grizzly bear and infuse it with demon blood so that it breathes fire.
Kim: I like it.
Rhi: So… [laughter]
Josie: I want one. [laughter]
Kim: Yeah, same.
Rhi: But yeah, I think, Blaire, you have studied the Deathlands enough to where you probably—
Kim: Can I roll Study?
Rhi: Yeah, knock yourself out.
Kim: Aw, dammit. They both came up as 3.
Rhi: Okay. You can’t tell. But yeah, the two teenagers wander off and the owner sees the four of you.
Rhi (as Owner): Ah, yes, step up, step up! You get five points, you could win something on this shelf, 10 points gets you here, and 20 gets you the ash bear—made of real ash bear pelt!
Rhi: She flips the jaw open and the fire lolls out.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: She puts it back.
Rhi (as Owner): So, can I interest you in a game? Who’s up first?
Josie (as Minx): [chanting] My-ra, My-ra!
Minna: Myra steps forward and offers a coin.
Rhi: Go ahead and roll whatever you would like to roll for this.
Minna: It’s probably like Hunt, right?
Rhi: Yeah, probably.
Minna: It’s a 5.
Madge: [cheer]
Minna: I was actually low key hoping she’d fail humorously.
Rhi: [laugh] Okay. Myra, you focus, you’re pretty slow and methodical about it, but you manage to get… You get 16 points, which is enough to get you something off the 15 point shelf, but not up to the ash bear. So, you can get an umbra lion—is the panther-like thing—or a Deathlands crow.
Minna: I’m gonna go for a Deathlands crow, because it’s sort of on-brand.
Josie and Madge: [laughter]
Rhi: She gives you a crow.
Madge: Can I examine the things that the rings are being tossed onto?
Rhi: Yeah, sure.
Madge: Cool. What would I roll for that?
Rhi: Probably Study or Survey, if you’re just looking at them.
Madge: Okay.
Rhi: Phin, what are you looking for?
Madge: Um, one, I wanna see if it’s rigged in any sort of way.
Rhi: It is, a little bit. The further back that the stakes are that you have to get the rings onto, the farther away they are, the more points they’re worth. You can see that the ones that’re further back, they’re tilted away just a little bit so it’s a little harder to get the ring on there. That is what you observe in Studying these while Myra is doing her ring toss.
The woman hands over the crow and is like:
Rhi (as Owner): All right, so, who’s next?
Kim (as Blaire): Minx wants to go next.
Rhi: [laughter]
Kim: I push Minx.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, uh, yes, yes, of course. All right.
Josie: I’m gonna roll some dice about it here.
Rhi: What are you rolling?
Josie: I was gonna roll Finesse, if that’s okay.
Rhi: Finesse makes sense for this.
Josie: Mhmm. And I got a 6 about it.
Rhi: Maybe Phin points out the rigged stakes in the back—
Kim: Ooh!
Madge: Yeah. I was thinking that she, like—
Josie: Mhmm.
Madge: Kicks it with her ankle right as she throws it. [chuckle]
Rhi: Yeah! I like that.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: I like that.
Josie: You kinda Fonzie this. [laughter]
Rhi: [laughter] Yeah. When Minx makes the toss, Phin nudges it with her ankle and the stakes all shift a little bit, and the rings land on the farther back ones. Yes, that’s very good. So, yes, you manage to get exactly 20 points.
Josie: Yes!
Rhi: The woman is still smiling, very brightly, but the smile looks just a little more plastered on now.
Rhi (as Owner): Wow! 20 points! You’re the first one today who’s made that. Well, congratulations.
Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: She holds out the bear.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you. It seems that luck is on my side this evening.
Madge: [chuckle]
Josie: And I’ll wink at Phin. [laughter]
Rhi: [laugh]
Josie (as Minx): Myra, this was your choice, so if you do want to partake of this, you can. Or shall I give it to Blaire and watch her poor little heart collapse?
Kim (as Blaire): Wha…?
Madge: Aww!
Minna (as Myra): I’m fine.
Kim: Yeah, no, I wanna give this a shot.
Rhi: All right. Blaire is also gonna—
Kim: Yes. I have nothing in Finesse or Hunt.
Madge: No matter what you choose, could I get Blaire an extra dice?
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: You wanna help her out?
Madge: Yeah. I’m gonna kick the thing again. [laugh]
Rhi: What’d you get?
Kim: [sadly] 1.
Madge: Aww!
Rhi: Oh no!
Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Oh, jeez.
Kim: Why is it my prettiest dice that’s cursed?
Rhi: Tell us how this looks with Blaire.
Kim: Okay. I don’t think she’s ever played a carnival game like this before. She’s focusing really intently; she’s sticking her tongue out and squinting and she’s doing a couple like… Like she’s throwing a frisbee. She’s doing a couple preparatory wrist moves. Like one, two! And by the time she’s almost ready to actually throw it, her hands just catch a little bit too early and it leaves her hand, but she wasn’t ready to properly throw it, so it just kinda flies out of her hand. It probably tinks something, and then it falls down and doesn’t even it hit one of the pegs.
Rhi: [laugh] I think, on a 1, Blaire gets like three points, which isn’t enough to actually win anything.
Josie and Madge: Aww.
Kim (as Blaire): Hmph, that’s okay.
Josie (as Minx): It’s okay. You do have a bear here to comfort you.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww.
Josie: I’ll put it on Blaire’s back.
Madge: Aww!
Rhi: [laughing] Oh, God. Are you doing the thing where you’re putting it on her shoulder?
Josie: Yes.
Kim: Ah!
Rhi: Excellent. Phin, are you gonna try your hand at this?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: All right.
Madge: 5.
Rhi: Like Myra, you also get a little over 15 points, which, as you guys were switching off, she put up a second ash bear and just eyeballed all of you.
Josie and Madge: [laughter]
Rhi: So, you can get either the umbra lion or the Deathlands crow.
Madge: I’m taking the lion of nightmares.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: She gives you the horrible, scary lion.
Madge: Yay.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent. That is a bit of a haul we’ve acquired.
Kim (as Blaire): New friends.
Josie (as Minx): Good score, everyone.
Rhi: Oh no, I just have this mental image of all the stuffed animals sitting in front of your vault to guard it. [laugh]
Josie and Kim: Aww!
Rhi: Is there anything else that you guys want to do?
Josie: I wanna pick up a present for Rigney.
Kim: Oh, right.
Minna: Yeah, we need to do that.
Madge: We have to do that.
Rhi: Okay. What do you guys wanna get?
Josie: I was gonna get him some sort of fancy glass, or perhaps some sort of wine vintage he doesn’t carry.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, what was your—
Kim: I want to get him some kind of bowtie that will match the vest that Phin got him.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Minna: I’m so fucking bad at gifts but I wanna get him something.
Rhi: [laugh]
Minna: I feel like it might be, like, a nice food-related thing. Maybe some kind of fancy oil to dip your bread in that makes everything taste better.
Kim: Good cheese.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Like, a cheese plate.
Rhi: Or good cheese. You could do cheese.
Minna: Or cheese. Something like that.
Rhi: Okay. You guys head off into the street festivals, scouting out Nightmarket’s various shops. Minx and Myra, I think you two are able… There’s a… It’s a wine shop, but they also sell glassware and fine cheeses and stuff like that to go with your wine. You guys come across that shop first, and you’re able to find some stuff there. I think I’ll have you both roll your Stash. So, however many rows you have filled in, roll that many dice to see what quality you can afford.
Josie: Mm, I rolled a 1.
Minna: I rolled a 2.
Rhi: Oh no.
Josie: I spent a lot of money today. [laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. You guys both get in there and you’re like, “oh, we’re out of pocket change.” Minx, you’re able to find… It’s a nice bottle of a mushroom cap wine, but you’re not sure if it’s one that he doesn’t have already. But it’s still nice.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: And Myra, you are able to find a thing that’s a nice, simple selection of some different goat cheeses.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. You guys can get that. And then, Blaire, you said you wanted to get a bowtie?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: As you guys are making your way through the streets, you turn a corner, and you hear a voice going:
Rhi (as Voice): Minx? Minx, is that you?
Josie: Minx perks up and looks around.
Rhi: You see, working her way through the crowd, is Nyryx. She is a bit dressed up. She’s wearing some nicer clothes, she’s got her hair pinned up, and she has a parcel under one arm.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [out of breath] There you are. I started off at the pub that you spend so much time at, and I’ve been looking for you all over. [catching her breath] So glad I finally found you.
Josie (as Minx): I must say, I’m honored, though I’m sorry to give you the runaround, as it were. What brings you to this part of town?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, was looking for you, actually.
Rhi: She says, and seems to a little bit belatedly notice the other three, and:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh, um, hi. Sorry. It’s, um, good to see you again.
Rhi: She nods at Blaire, gives a slightly more hesitant nod to Myra, and then looks to Phin.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh, um, and… I’m so sorry. I don’t think we’ve met.
Madge (as Phin): We probably haven’t.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, yes. Uh, Nyryx, this is Phin. Phin, Nyryx.
Madge (as Phin): Hey.
Rhi: Nyryx holds out a hand to shake.
Madge: Phin will shake it.
Rhi (as Nyryx): So, you’re one of the ones who’s been putting up with Minx here for the last few months, I take it.
Josie (as Minx): Let’s say that Phin is less of one to “put up with” me, and more to set me right.
Rhi (as Nyryx): That’s good. She needs that. She needs a lot of that.
Rhi: Nyryx gives you a fond, wry smile, and takes the package out from under her arm.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh, this is for you.
Josie (as Minx): Ooh. I– Is this for polite company, or privacy?
Rhi (as Nyryx): You should, uh… open that when we’re not somewhere so public.
Rhi: She winks at you.
Josie (as Minx): Very well.
Josie: She’ll blush a bit and tuck it under her arm.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Anyway, um…
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Oh my goodness, I haven’t quite found the time to package up something for you yet. Shall we take a bit of a walk, find something?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Um, yeah. That sounds good.
Rhi: She takes Minx’s arm, and:
Rhi (as Nyryx): It was good seeing you all again. Um, it was nice to meet you, Phin.
Madge (as Phin): You too.
Kim (as Blaire): Bye.
Minna: Myra nods.
Rhi: She nods at Myra, but kind of avoids her gaze a little bit.
Minna: I think they’re both being very awkward around each other.
Rhi: Uh-huh.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: It was not a good meeting last time.
Rhi: No. Minx and Nyryx head off into the crowd. And the other three of you can continue on your bowtie quest.
Josie: Bowtie quest.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Yes, it’s very important. You wander around a little bit, and you are able to find a place selling… You know.
Kim: Haberdashery!
Rhi: Yes. You find a haberdashery. They do have a lovely selection of bowties, including some that look like they would be a good match for the vest that Rigney was gifted earlier.
Kim: 6!
Rhi: This particular shop that you found has a really, really steep discount going on for Doskvorn, so you’re able to get, I think, not only a bowtie, but a matching handkerchief.
Kim: Yes!
Madge: [chuckle]
Kim: He’s gonna love it.
Rhi: It all coordinates very nicely with the vest.
## [00:59:14]
Rhi: I have a quick question: did Minx give somebody the wine that she bought for Rigney before she wandered off?
Josie: Yes. [laugh]
Rhi: Okay. We’ll cut over to Minx and Nyryx, who I think are just meandering through the streets, at this point.
Josie (as Minx): It has been some time since we’ve spent a Doskvorn together, hasn’t it?
Rhi (as Nyryx): [sigh] Years, I think.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Was that… Was the last time before or after?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh, it was before.
Josie (as Minx): Jeez.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yeah. After that, we all sort of went our own ways with figuring out how to make our way in the world.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I’m glad I was able to track you down. It’s—
Josie (as Minx): [laughter]
Rhi (as Nyryx): I have my friends from work, but it’s nice to get to spend the holiday with people who’ve known you for as long as we’ve known each other.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. I share that sentiment. Although, I was unsure if you were in a position to want me to stream by your neighborhood this evening.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Silkshore is a bit of a headache on Doskvorn. It starts off well enough, but then just descends into, well, drug-fueled orgy, really.
Josie (as Minx): Ah. Hm. Yes, I can see how that could be tiresome. [laughter]
Rhi (as Nyryx): Mm, yes. [sigh] So, I managed to have the day off.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent. I’m glad to hear it.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yeah. It’s nice, just getting to take some time for myself and catch up with you, and… I heard a rumor that you and Bazso are maybe mending some bridges?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, at the very least, when I went to see him, he did not murder me outright. So, we are starting from somewhere.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I mean, that is rather a distinct improvement from when I saw him after he first good out of Ironhook. So, yes, we’ll celebrate that win.
Josie (as Minx): It takes some time, and I suspect it will never be as it was. But believe it or not, I do admire the man after some fashion.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Hm. [sigh] I don’t think that any of us can be the way that we were before, back then. It was… simpler, but a lot harder, in ways.
Josie (as Minx): Quite. But I must say that I’m very glad that things do seem to be going well on your end, whereas me and Bazso are wrapped up in our [sigh] various feuds, and the like.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Mm. Well, you two were always the ones to jump feet first into trouble.
Josie (as Minx): [laugh]
Rhi: You’re walking arm in arm, and she stops abruptly, and pulls you to a stop.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [gasp] Oh, look at these! Aren’t they lovely?
Rhi: She’s peering in a window where there’s a display of some nice tortoiseshell combs and a nice hand mirror; you know, a few little things like that.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. I do believe we’ve arrived at our destination, then.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Josie: Minx is gonna gently lead her inside. Will I be able to afford it at all?
Rhi: I’m gonna say you can either roll your stash again to see, or you can roll Sway to try to talk the proprietor into a lower price.
Josie: I am definitely gonna do that thing.
Rhi: [laugh]
Josie: I think I’m going to make a show of pointing out the slightly more expensive one, but then we go down to, like:
Josie (as Minx): Oh, no, this one should be more in our price range.
Josie: Then when he tells me the price, I’ll be like:
Josie (as Minx): What? Surely we can bring this down, especially compared to that one. That one is already so high and overpriced. Surely this one…
Josie: You know, that sort of thing. [laugh] Triple 5s.
Rhi: You’re able to bring the price down a bit. Not quite as much as you were hoping, but enough to where, basically, whatever cash you were carrying around, this is the last of it. But you are able to afford it. The owner wraps it up and hands it over to you.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent. Thank you, good sir. I’m glad we could come to an arrangement.
Josie: As we leave, I’m gonna gently run it through Nyryx’s hair once before handing it to her.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Thank you, dear.
Rhi: Then bounces up on her toes and give you a quick kiss.
Josie: Aww! I’m gonna give her a peck back. [laugh]
## [01:03:42]
Rhi: I think we’ll leave those two and return back to The Hound’s Paw, which is still quite crowded. But Rigney does… You know, he gives you a wave, but doesn’t really make to leave from behind the bar. He’s very clearly rapidly filling drink orders, and seems kinda pinned down back there. If you guys make your way up to the bar and kind of wedge yourselves in, you can talk to him.
Minna: I think we do that.
Rhi: Okay.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, good to see you again. I wasn’t expecting to see you back here today.
Minna (as Myra): [laugh] Sorry to bother you while you’re working. We just thought we’d return the favor from earlier.
Minna: And Myra draws out her gift and hands it over.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh. Oh! Uh—
Rhi: He’s in mid-pour, and he’s like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Thank you so mu– Let me just—
Rhi: And he finishes with it, slides the glass down the bar, and then reaches.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, this is great, thank you so much. I… You really– You didn’t have to. I mean, I appreciate it, but…
Minna (as Myra): Rigney, please. We’re friends.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yes. Yes we are. Very good friends. And I see you have lost one.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, she’s with another friend.
Rhi (as Rigney): Ah. All right.
Rhi: Do you give Minx’s gift?
Minna: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
Minna (as Myra): And this is from Minx.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, that’s a pretty nice one. And I can actually enjoy it myself.
Rhi: He, with his foot, kicks open a cabinet under the bar and tucks the wine and cheese in there.
Rhi (as Rigney): Save that for after this incredibly busy day.
Kim: Blaire is… She’s very excited. She’s gonna run up to Rigney. She’s bouncing in place.
Kim (as Blaire): I got you something that I think is probably a little better than the drawing.
Rhi (as Rigney): I don’t know, it was a very nice drawing.
Rhi: He takes the little bag there.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, these are– Oh, these are great! Here, I’m gonna… You know what?
Rhi: And, oh, he is now wearing Phin’s vest.
Madge: Aww!!
Rhi: He found time to change. [laugh]
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, well, I… Ah, these are perfect. Oh, well, here, hang on. Carter, cover the bar for me for a second. Here, Blaire, come here.
Rhi: He pulls Blaire aside so that he can do up the bowtie. I think while they’re talking, Myra and Phin, if you guys wanna step aside and—
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: I think we’ve stepped aside from the bar, and I think Myra puts a hand on Phin’s arm.
Minna (as Myra): I actually had something for you, as well.
Madge (as Phin): Really?
Minna: She pulls out, basically, a packet of folded brown paper or whatever and hands it over. And inside, if she opens it…?
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: It’s a necklace—
Madge: Aww!
Minna: On a cord. There’s a little bundle, and I think she’s gonna say:
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know if, on the docks, they do this, but where I come from, at least some people, at least people I knew, we made these charms. They’re supposed to be protective. You make them for the people in your life that you care about.
Madge: [overcome] Aaah! It’s so cute. Oh no. I love it. Phin puts it on immediately. [chuckle]
Rhi: [laughter]
Madge (as Phin): Okay, that makes this a whole lot better, because I got you something, too, and I didn’t want it to be weird. Um, I noticed that the ink that you were… Not the ink, but the pen you were using, it blots, and it’s awful. So, I—
Madge: And she pulls out a little box.
Madge (as Phin): Uh, [stuttering] h– here.
Madge: And [laugh] she hands it over.
Minna: Myra opens it and finds a nice pen, right?
Madge: Yeah. It’s a nice pen, and also a thick stack of new parchment, too.
Minna: Oh, gosh. I think Myra opens it and she looks at Phin.
Minna (as Myra): This is actually very nice. I’m sure I’ll use it all of the time. Thank you so much.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. I know it’s not, uh… If I’d known about the… If– the tradition… I would have made you one, too, so, uh, next year.
Minna (as Myra): No, it’s fine. Last year you welcomed me into your family’s home. That was the least I could do in return.
Madge: Phin hugs her real tight.
Minna: Aww!
Josie: Yay!
Kim: Aww!
Minna: Myra hugs back. [laugh]
Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: I think that we’ll pull out from that hug through the crowd, back out into the streets, in a big, panning shot over Nightmarket, which is still crowded and full of light. Then, the light fades out, and the crowds fade away from the streets, and it’s the day after Doskvorn. Myra is picking her way up through the streets towards the bookshop where the translator she had hired, Preet, works. It is picking her way, because you guys have all seen the aftermath of a carnival. There is trash littering the streets, drunks littering the streets; there’s just a stray Akarosian goat kinda wandering, eating the trash. It just seems to have gotten loose and is meandering through the streets. It’s gonna be a day or two before the district goes back to normal.
But you get to the bookshop, which is open. It’s very quiet; there’s no other customers in there. The day after Doskvorn tends to be a quiet day for a lot of shops in Nightmarket. Preet is at her desk at the end of the counter, scribbling in a book.
Minna (as Myra): Preet, how are you? Did you have a good night last night?
Rhi: She startles a little bit.
Rhi (as Preet): Oh, Lizete. Um, yes, yes. I had a very nice time. I didn’t really stay in Nightmarket; it’s a bit loud for me, but, no, it was very nice. I take it you’re here about those notes that you asked me to translate?
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi: She nods and leans over in her satchel. She pulls out a leather folio that has been almost entirely encased in twine. There are so many loops and knots here you are gonna need a knife and a little bit of time to get this thing open again. She holds it out.
Rhi (as Preet): Um, I finished the translation. I’m gonna have to ask that you never bring me anything like this ever again.
Kim: Woah.
Minna (as Myra): Oh. Is it that bad?
Rhi (as Preet): Um, well, it’s extremely illegal, and I’m also not… I haven’t been sleeping terribly well since reading some of this stuff.
Minna (as Myra): I am so sorry. I had no idea it would be quite like that.
Rhi (as Preet): It’s… It’s all right. Just, in the future, if you find anything with spooky drawings, um, take it to someone else.
Minna (as Myra): Of course.
Rhi: She’s wringing her hands together a little bit.
Rhi (as Preet): Um, so, uh, yes. That’s all of the notes translated. I don’t know what you intend to do with it, and I think I’d rather keep it that way.
Minna (as Myra): Of course. My silence and your payment.
Minna: She slides the payment with a little bit of extra coin included.
Rhi: She takes the money and then sets it in her satchel
Rhi (as Preet): Um, anyway, I need to get back to work. [sigh]
Minna (as Myra): Yes. Thank you again.
Rhi (as Preet): You’re welcome.
Rhi: She turns back to her book. She looks a little shaken.
You step back out into the streets with a whole bunch of very interesting notes to look over and share with the rest of your crew.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall and, as always, thank you for listening. Sorry for sounding a little croaky in this intro; I kinda lost my voice at Gen Con, which, by the way, losing my voice aside, was absolutely fantastic. It was so wonderful to meet so many awesome people, both current listeners and people who hadn’t listened yet. If you are a new listener that I met at Gen Con, welcome! And please go back to episode one to start from there, if you haven’t. This episode is not gonna make any sense otherwise.
One other announcement: next month, Tess of RPG Casts and I Am Hear has organized a really great event for International Podcast Month. She has gotten together a large group of podcasters who do actual play and audio dramas and had them record a number of special one shot or mini dramas for International Podcast Month. Minna and I both participated in one shot games that will air in September. You can visit internationalpodcastmonth.com for more details. That link will also be in the show notes.
Next, Josie is going to share this month’s featured charity.
Josie: The Silvia Rivera Law Project is a collective organization that works to provide legal help to transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming people, especially those that are low income or people of color. Trans and intersex people, especially queer trans PoC, face significant discrimination and difficulty in making sure they are accurately and fairly represented under the law, and the current administration has only increased these risks. The SRLP provides assistance in seeking name and gender form changes and legal representation, as well as advocating for the rights of transgender prisoners. To learn more or make a donation, visit srlp.org.
Rhi: For our US listeners, you can also visit 5calls.org to find scripts on pressing issues that our representatives need to hear about. Please check to make sure that you are registered to vote no matter where you live or how certain you are that you’re already registered. The upcoming midterm elections are going to be absolutely critical in slowing the tide of hate, bigotry, and harm coming from the Republican Party.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## [00:02:32] Story resumes
Rhi: We start off on a closeup of a newspaper article. Beside the headline is a detailed sketch of The Magpies signature pin. The headline reads:
“Brigands Strike Embassy and Clinic in Ongoing Campaign of Terror,” by Anita Argent, staff reporter.
“The criminal gang known as The Magpies, identified by their distinctive pins left at the scenes of their numerous crimes, have continued to strike terror into the good people of Duskwall. Their theft at the Iruvian Embassy and attempted assassination of Ambassador Elstera Avrathi, reported in this very paper, was apparently only the beginning of their senseless campaign of violence. A mere nine days ago, shortly before Doskvorn, they infiltrated the research clinic of well-known physicker Dr. Elias Hagen and set off multiple bombs. Two guards were killed in the explosions, another was injured, and dozens of coin worth of valuable medical supplies were stolen. Dr. Hagen believes that this brazen attack will set his research back by months, if not years.
“Despite their frequent attacks, little is known of the members of this mysterious gang. They are a group of four women, and surviving witnesses describe them as well-armed, well-organized, and astonishingly cruel. They seemed to act out of a desire only to cause fear and pain. The Bluecoats and Inspectors already possess an extensive case file on the group, but until they are caught, Duskwall remains gripped by the terrifying question: where will The Magpies strike next?”
We zoom out to see The Magpies themselves at—
Minna: [giggling]
Rhi: Their traditional table in The Hound’s Paw, huddled around a copy of The Doskvol Daily, where this article is printed. Across the table from you guys, your friends from The North Hook Mirror, the other newspaper in town, Lani and Roxanne, who are watching you read this article, looking a little bit amused.
Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: When you look up, Lani just gives you this big grin and does this big, showy sign that Roxanne translates as:
Rhi (as Roxanne): Congratulations, you’re famous!
Kim (as Blaire): “Striking terror?”
Josie (as Minx): I must say, I’m not surprised, but also not what I was hoping for.
Kim (as Blaire): Also, this is highly inaccurate. They described this as “organized.”
Josie: I—
Josie, Madge, Minna, and Rhi: [laughter]
Madge (as Phin): I mean, she’s not wrong. She’s not wrong in that criticism.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I suppose all press is good press, as the saying goes.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Josie (as Minx): That… I mean, that’s the conventional wisdom I choose to believe, at this point. [chuckle]
Kim (as Blaire): But, like, people know who we are now. We bought hundreds of those pins. We can’t leave them around anymore.
Josie (as Minx): Why not?
Minna (as Myra): Weren’t we trying to have them say our names?
Madge (as Phin): I think this is part of the plan.
Rhi: Yeah. And the article does not include names or descriptions of you, other than you’re all women.
Kim: Fair.
Rhi: They seem to be a little light on that point, so…
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. I think the point was for them to get to know the gang as a force. Not sure we want it to be known as a force of cruelty, but you know what? I’m okay with the people that we attacked thinking we’re cruel, because—
Madge (as Phin): They deserved it?
Kim (as Blaire): We’re cruel to them, sure, but cruel in general? I don’t know.
Rhi: Lani cuts in at that point and nods at Myra, and signs her thoughts on this.
Rhi (as Lani): The Doskvol Daily is more or less a paper for the nobility. I mean, The North Hook Mirror isn’t exactly aiming at the common masses, but I think we aim for a little more accuracy in our reporting. We actually came by to see you again because we saw this article. We were wondering if either of these places, the embassy or the clinic… Well, first, we’re assuming that it’s accurate that you actually hit either of these places. But if you did, we were wondering if either of them had any connection to The Circle of Flame.
Josie (as Minx): The embassy did. The clinic was… somewhat unrelated. But we did find confirmation: correspondence between The Circle of Flame and Ambassador Avrathi, as well as a journal that, I believe, Myra was working on translating.
Minna (as Myra): I’ve gotten the translations back, but I’d rather not pass the information to you until I’ve had a little more chance to sort through it. It could be quite dangerous.
Rhi (as Lani): Of course, of course. We understand. Would the letter be all right to look at?
Kim: I’ll have it on me.
Rhi: Okay. Are you gonna let them take a look at the letter?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Lani takes it and Roxanne leans over her shoulder to read it. You see their eyes both get really wide, then Lani sets down the letter, and they both start signing at each other rapid fire. Minx, you can maybe pick up every 10th word—maybe.
Josie: [laugh] There’s some swearing in there.
Rhi: [laugh] Yeah. Those, you can pick out. But eventually, Roxanne turns to the rest of you and says:
Rhi (as Roxanne): This is… This is huge. We’ve been working on putting together our article exposing The Circle of Flame, and having confirmation that the Iruvian ambassador is involved in things like this—that’s huge. Would you be willing to let us borrow this letter?
Kim: I’m asking the group: do you think it’s a good idea to let them have it, or should we give them a copy?
Madge: Let’s give a copy, I think.
Josie: Yes. And it’s also probably a bit too early to break the scoop without bringing their wrath down upon the Mirror.
Minna (as Myra): This Avrathi person is a dangerous person. It may not be the best idea until we’ve had a little more chance to feel out the extent of that danger.
Rhi: You can see both of them sort of… They were really excited. They both slump a little bit, but Lani nods and slides the letter back and signs:
Rhi (as Lani): If you can make a copy and bring it to us later on, we’d love to have it. It would be very helpful. But you’re right, we’ll need a little more information, I think, before we go public with this. But this is… this is very significant. And if you do find anything else, we’d really appreciate it.
Rhi: Roxanne checks at her coin purse for a second, and then shakes her head and adds:
Rhi (as Roxanne): Whenever you bring the copy by, we can pay you for the information, as well.
Josie (as Minx): Ooh, excellent.
Rhi (as Roxanne): I just don’t have enough on me right now.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s okay.
Rhi (as Roxanne): I just brought drinking money.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): No stress. We are working towards a common goal, it seems, here.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Yes. Well, I think we might go and actually start doing some research of our own into Avrathi—not as up close and person as you apparently got, but there’s all kinds of things to find in the city records, so…
Minna (as Myra): Just let us know what you find. I think the more information we all have, the better.
Madge (as Phin): Mhmm.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Agreed.
Rhi: They stand up and say their goodbyes, and detour by the bar and talk to Rigney for a second before heading out. A few moments after they’ve left, Rigney comes over with a fresh round of drinks.
Rhi (as Rigney): [grunt] They paid for your next round.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh.
Minna: Aww!
Josie: Aww!
Kim: Aww!
Rhi: Switches out your empty glasses for a fresh one, and then he heads back to the bar.
Minna (as Myra): I got those translations back. I know we haven’t had a chance to meet about this yet.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, of course. Do tell.
Minna (as Myra): There’s quite a bit in the translations. I’ve put together a summary of what’s in there. It’s not great. I mean, first of all, Blaire, you know that eye of yours?
Kim (as Blaire): Mhmm.
Minna (as Myra): I think I may know what it is.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Madge (as Phin): Really?
Minna (as Myra): Three relics, the relics of Kotar, it seems that these people are interested in, were taken from the remains of a sorcerer or a demon—something from before the cataclysm. They’ve been lost for quite a long time. Having all three of them is supposed to give you power. There is an annotation next to the entry about the Eye of Kotar that says “fucking Magpies,” so I would guess that you did steal that. It seems to be the only one of those objects that they—
Kim (as Blaire): [long, hesitant noise]
Minna (as Myra): Are you okay?
Rhi: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): I… Yeah. I’m just curious, why do you think it said “fucking Magpies?”
Minna (as Myra): You stole it, didn’t you?
Kim (as Blaire): [hesitantly] Yes…? Kind of?
Minna (as Myra): I think they know that we stole it.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Madge (as Phin): Great.
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, it’s okay. We can fix this. Um… We just have… You know. Yeah. We, we have to make sure they don’t find it.
Madge (as Phin): By throwing it into the river.
Kim (as Blaire): No! I can throw it up in a box and lock it up real good, trust me.
Madge (as Phin): Okay. That’s also a good option, as long as we don’t take it out anymore.
Josie (as Minx): Although, I do believe you stole it from a locked box.
Kim (as Blaire): No, but I can lock a really good box.
Josie (as Minx): Is it like a magic lockbox?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah, I put like protection spells and shit on it.
Josie (as Minx): Can you actually do that? [chuckle]
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I did that to hide clothes from my sister.
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Minna: To hide what from your sister?
Josie (as Minx): I– I’m—
Rhi: Clothes. [laughter]
Minna: Bless!
Josie (as Minx): I’m glad you’re using your magic for a noble cause. [laugh]
Minna (as Myra): Also, I know you’ve been experimenting with it. It might help to know that you can see anything within a mile of your location with it.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Minna (as Myra): According to their notes. They may be out of date; I don’t know.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s pretty cool.
Minna (as Myra): It’s one of three objects: the Eye of Kotar, the Hand of Kotar, and the Heart of Kotar. It’s the only one that they had, or that they had a really good lead on.
Kim (as Blaire): Right. And the other two are still missing.
Minna (as Myra): The other two are still missing. One of them, there is absolutely no information about where it’s located. As for the Hand, there’s a couple of city names, and one of those is Duskwall. But the information is very sketchy. I don’t know that it’s very useful to us just yet. But I’ll pass the notes on to you.
Kim (as Blaire): So, we get all three, and then hide them all together, so that way they can’t get it.
Josie (as Minx): Or, if they do find them, then they get all of them at once.
Kim (as Blaire): But they won’t.
Josie (as Minx): At this point, throwing them into the ocean sounds like the best plan.
Kim (as Blaire): [distressed noise] You guys are unfun!
Madge (as Phin): Or… just straight up destroying them.
Kim (as Blaire): No! We can’t destroy it.
Josie (as Minx): As in, we shouldn’t, or we literally cannot?
Kim (as Blaire): We shouldn’t.
Madge (as Phin): I was more worried about, you know, the fact that horrible people could use them for horrible purposes.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s why we have to get them.
Minna (as Myra): Speaking of people using horrible objects for horrible purposes—
Kim (as Blaire): Go on.
Minna (as Myra): Uh, there’s a relic that worries me a little bit more than any of the Kotar relics. That object I was looking into, the blood-iron ring, it seems they’re a little bit closer to finding that one. I don’t like what she said about it.
Kim (as Blaire): Why’s that?
Minna (as Myra): I’ve told you a lot about what I found out about it—you know, the fact that it can be used to gain extrasensory perception. Looks like the last person known to have owned it lived in The Lost District and died in the plague that killed it. They are having trouble getting in there, but they’re pretty sure that it is in The Lost District. And after they find the ring, they want to find a way to make more rings. And I… [sigh] Okay, I am going to read the exact quote, because I really can’t summarize it better than what she says herself. She wrote: “a dozen sacrifices a year and I’ll be richer than the Lord Governor.”
Josie (as Minx): Absolutely abhorrent.
Minna (as Myra): I feel very uneasy with letting them get ahold of this ring, because that’s… The fact that they… Sorry, I am having a little bit of trouble speaking about this.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s okay. I mean, it’s disturbing.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Minna (as Myra): It’s very disturbing. And they’re going to do it if they get ahold of it. And they are very close to getting hold of it. They just need to find a way into The Lost District.
Kim (as Blaire): So…
Josie (as Minx): Do we have a way in?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Are you saying what I think you’re saying?
Minna (as Myra): It seems that their worry is about The Spirit Wardens and The Silver Nails, who are both guarding The Lost District. If we can find a way to convince one of them to let us in… I very much doubt we’ll get any traction with The Spirit Wardens, but maybe we can do something with The Silver Nails.
Kim (as Blaire): Hm, maybe.
Rhi: I’ll slide in here to tell you guys what you know about The Silver Nails. The Silver Nails are a former mercenary company from Severos. They fought for The Empire in the Unity War against Skovlan. They were a cavalry company. They have horses that are trained to fight ghosts.
Kim: Sick!
Josie: What?!
Rhi: Right? Sidebar: that’s the coolest shit!
Kim: That’s awesome!
Josie: Awesome.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s extremely good. The gang’s name comes from… They each wear a ring that is a hammered silver nail that they believe protects them from possession.
Kim: They’re metal as hell.
Rhi: They are also based in Six Towers. Their headquarters is widely known to be The Mustang, which is an inn and stables up at the north end of the district; basically, the opposite side of where you are. You guys haven’t ever really crossed paths with them. None of you were really aware that The Silver Nails had an interest in The Lost District, but it makes some sense—they’re very adept at fighting ghosts, so being able to take over an area outside the lightning barrier that is full of whatever wealth was abandoned by the nobility when plague took the district, that makes sense.
What’s your plan from here?
Minna (as Myra): Is it perhaps worth at least having a chat with Silver Nails? See whether we can get their help.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, we could try.
Minna (as Myra): We would have to come up with something that would benefit them, but I’m sure we could find something.
Josie (as Minx): I imagine a classic exchange of services might be able to be arranged.
Minna (as Myra): So it’s just a matter of finding out what they want.
Rhi: All right. You guys gonna set off to The Mustang?
Madge: Yup.
Rhi: You make your way across Six Towers, up to the inn and stables owned by The Silver Nails. There’s a large, fenced-in lot where there’s a few horses trotting around, and there’s a good-sized stable beside the inn, which is a solid three-story building. There are a few Severosi individuals hanging out outside in that fake casual way, where, to the average person, they would look like they were just standing around casually, but you all recognize them as, you know, these are guards. But the inn is open. When you head inside, there’s a simple lobby that has… There’s a large, open archway that leads into a small bar area, and then a couple hallways that lead off into rooms and stairs heading up. For Six Towers, it’s fairly simple furnishing and decor. Six Towers tends to be kind of an area of faded grandeur. There’s a number of other Severosi individuals who you assume are probably part of the gang hanging around.
If you guys just walk in and stand there and look around, eventually, somebody will come over from what would be the check-in counter.
Josie: Well, I was about to ask if there was one of…
Rhi: Oh, yes, there is. Yeah, if you wanna head over there instead.
Josie: Yes. I think Minx will look around for that and head right over there.
Josie (as Minx): I do believe I have an inquiry.
Rhi (as Person at the Counter): Yeah, what can I do for you?
Rhi: It’s a younger woman; dark skin, dark hair pulled back in a knot at the back of her neck. She does have the characteristic silver nail ring on her hand.
Josie (as Minx): Now, presuming this desk does indeed perform its stated purpose, how would we go about making appointments for an exchange of services?
Rhi (as Woman at the Counter): What kind of services?
Josie (as Minx): Those pertaining to transportation in unsafe areas—unsafe for reasons that your organization might be able to help out with.
Rhi: She narrows her eyes at you for a second. Not glaring, but she’s kinda like “okay,” thoughtfully, and then gives you a slow nod.
Rhi (as Woman at the Counter): Go grab a table by the bar. Somebody will be over in a minute.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, there’s a bar. Excellent. We shall be over in a moment.
Rhi: She nods and watches you head back off.
Josie: I figured being blunt here is better than my normal circuitous route.
Rhi: [chuckle] You guys head into the bar, grab a table. It’s maybe a quarter full; there’s not a ton of people here. After not too terribly long, a minute or two, another Severosi woman comes over. She looks more middle aged, probably in her late 30s, early 40s. She is missing her left arm from just below the elbow and has on her upper arms and face a number of scars. She comes over, pulls out a chair, sits down, and says:
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): So, I understand that you all have interest in some kind of deal with us.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. May I ask who I’m speaking to?
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): Tuhan. I’m part of the leadership here.
Minna (as Myra): Wonderful to meet you, Tuhan. My name is Myra Keel. These are my associates.
Josie (as Minx): Minx. Pleasure.
Kim (as Blaire): Blaire.
Madge (as Phin): Taliesin.
Rhi: She gives you all nods.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): So, this is all of our people here. You can speak pretty plainly here. What is it exactly that you’re interested in?
Josie (as Minx): We need to gain entry into The Lost District. There are family treasures there that must be reclaimed, if you understand.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): [knowingly] Mhmm.
Josie (as Minx): And we come to propose that we ply our trade in exchange for you plying yours for entry and exit.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): Huh. And what is it, exactly, that you do?
Josie (as Minx): We are quite adept at infiltration and retrieval.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): Huh. So, you’re thieves.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): That’s not exactly where our skills lie, so… Hmm.
Rhi: She taps her fingers thoughtfully on the table for a minute.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): Actually, there might be something. The Hive is hosting a black market auction in a couple days. We’ve had some fallings out with them, so we’re no longer on the guest list, but one of the items that’s supposedly up for auction is a set of four perfectly intact and complete Spirit Warden uniforms.
Minna (as Myra): Ooh.
Josie (as Minx): Mm.
Rhi: She nods.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): We would very much like to obtain them, but, as I said, we can’t get in there without bringing down trouble that we’d rather not deal with on us. However, unless you have some trouble with The Hive, you might be able to get in and help yourself to the goods.
Josie (as Minx): On the contrary. This sounds as though it’ll be rather straightforward.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): Yeah. And you get us those uniforms, and… We’ve managed to establish some passages into The Lost District that The Spirit Wardens don’t know about. We’ve got a bit of a camp there. If you can get us those uniforms, we will get you into The Lost District, and if you survive whatever you’re going after, we’ll get you back out again.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Minna (as Myra): That sounds like a deal.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): All right. You all have a name as a group, or something?
Madge (as Phin): Not one that you would have heard of.
Josie (as Minx): It’s being workshopped.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): Ah. All right. Well, lemme tell you what I know about this auction. Like I said, it’s being hosted by The Hive over in Crow’s Foot. They’ve got a warehouse there. It’s supposed to be a pretty big showing. I think Lydia from The Crows is gonna be there; I know The Wraiths are sending some people; The Billhooks, I think, are sending someone. I even heard that Salia Ilmar or one of hers might be putting in an appearance—apparently, The Wraiths are selling a lot of intel.
Minna: [strangled noise] Sidebar.
Rhi: Mm?
Minna: [squeakily] Is that my Salia?
Rhi: Mhmm.
Minna: [squeakily] Oh, good. [laughter]
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): So, yeah, some decently big names. But that means that you lot shouldn’t attract much attention. Unfortunately, we don’t really have an in.
Josie (as Minx): That shouldn’t be a problem.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): Wonderful. The auction’s being held in two days, so you’ve got a little time to figure out how you’re getting in there and prepare.
Minna: Out of character: so, is this thing invitation only? Is that what was established?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: You’ve gotta have some kind of invite.
Minna: Excellent.
Rhi: Mhmm.
Madge: [groan]
Josie (as Minx): Then, time is a-wasting, as they say. Thank you for meeting with us.
Rhi (as Silver Nails Woman): Yeah. Looks like it’ll be a way to solve both of our problems.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Rhi: She nods at you all, holds out a hand to shake, and then… You guys wanna head on out?
Madge: Yup.
Minna: I’m curious what context we have to get us in there.
Josie: Um, that was a lot of names that I didn’t recognize, out of character, at least.
Minna: I wrote them down. It is The Crows, Lydia, The Wraiths, The Billhooks. We probably don’t have contacts with them.
Rhi: I mean, you know some people in The Billhooks. They’re not gonna help you get in. [laugh]
Madge: Mhmm.
Rhi: You also do have your crew contacts, don’t forget about them.
Minna: Yes.
Josie: Mhmm. We have a deal broker, Amancio. It’s an auction; we might be able to make that happen.
Minna: Mhmm.
Josie: And we also have Fitz, a collector.
Minna: He’s probably not going to be our best contact. But the deal broker may be, or might be able to put us in contact with someone.
Rhi: Do you all wanna go have a chat with one of your contacts?
Josie: Yeah. I mean, we might as well. It is a crew contact.
## [00:24:39] Contacts scene
Rhi: Okay. Are you gonna go see Amancio or Fitz? Those sounded like your top two candidates.
Josie: I think Amancio.
Minna: Mhmm.
Rhi: Tell me about Amancio.
Josie: I kind of like the idea of them being a little bit hyperactive. Like, they’re constantly in auction mode, a little bit.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Very fond of colorful cravats.
Kim: They have a hobby you wouldn’t expect them having. Something that seems very out of character just by looking at them and getting an assumption based on their appearance.
Minna: Miniature herb garden. [chuckle]
Madge: Aww.
Rhi: Oh, I like that. Okay.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: You get to his townhome in Charterhall and knock on the door. One of his servants greets you, recognizes you, and:
Rhi (as Servant): Oh, uh, yes, come on in. He’s back in the conservatory.
Rhi: Walks you back through the house, where, attached to the back of the house, clearly a new addition, is a large room—mostly glass, despite the fact that there’s no sun. But in the middle of the room is a not-terribly-tall, maybe only six or seven feet, tree that is glowing with a faint light…
Kim and Madge: Ooh.
Rhi: That none of you would recognize, because you’ve never actually seen it. But it is very faint sunlight. On shelves and tables around this room are a number of small pots and planters and things that have a number of small plants and herbs growing. It smells vey nice in here. Bent over one of the planters, carefully watering, is a man with medium-tan skin, dark hair that’s starting to gray, that’s slicked back. He’s wearing glasses and a very nice suit with a bright red and blue silk cravat. The servant walks you in and clears her throat.
Rhi (as Servant): Mr. Amancio, you have guests.
Rhi: He looks up and does a doubletake.
Rhi (as Amancio): Oh. Oh! My friends, hello! Wonderful. Oh, come in, come in, come in. Can I get you anything? Tea? Wine?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, tea would be perfect, my dear.
Rhi (as Amancio): Oh, all right. Let me see…
Rhi: He looks around at his plants.
Rhi (as Amancio): Ah, yes. This one.
Rhi: He picks up a plant and hands it to the servant.
Rhi (as Amancio): Four leaves per cup. Steep it for four minutes and then bring it back. It should be wonderful.
Rhi: The servant, looking very accustomed to this, nods and heads off.
Rhi (as Amancio): Ah, yes, sit, sit!
Rhi: There’s a padded bench that has more planters.
Rhi (as Amancio): Oh, uh, here.
Rhi: He quickly moves the planters.
Rhi (as Amancio): Sit, sit, sit! What brings you here?
Josie (as Minx): Well, first of all, I’m glad to see your taste has not diminished at all in the time since we last saw you. Impeccable, as always.
Rhi (as Amancio): Of course, of course.
Josie (as Minx): Unfortunately, we do attend on business today, but I see no reason we can’t also enjoy the garden.
Rhi (as Amancio): Oh, yes, yes. I have had a great deal of luck with this new strain.
Rhi: He picks up a plant.
Rhi (as Amancio): Well, I suppose it’s not actually new; it’s actually quite an ancient herb. But it has been quite difficult to get it to grow here. It is called rosemary!
Madge: [gasp]
Kim (as Blaire): How do you get all of this to grow without sunlight?
Rhi (as Amancio): Well, that’s why I have my radiant energy tree! Cost a fortune, but it produces enough light to grow these small plants. Some of the nobles, of course, have their radiant energy farms, where they can grow entire fruit-bearing trees and fruits and vegetables and the like. But this, this is enough for me.
Kim (as Blaire): [quietly] Fascinating.
Minna (as Myra): It’s quite impressive.
Rhi (as Amancio): Thank you, thank you. Ah, and you will get to taste some of the fruits of my labors, as soon as my servant returns with our tea. So, you had mentioned business. What business can I help you with today?
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. There is quite an intriguing auction coming up in the next couple days, and we find ourselves, quite incredibly, without an invitation. Surely, this is a mistake, you understand. You and I, we are cultured creatures, and would much enjoy such an event. We were wondering if there was, perhaps, some way you might set us on a path to acquiring our misplaced invitation.
Rhi (as Amancio): [laugh] Ah, well, let me think…
Rhi: I think, at this point, you’re going to need some kind of a roll. This could be a group check, if you wanted, since you’re all here. But yeah, we’re gonna need some kind of a roll to see what he’s got for you.
Josie: I regrettably feel like this is consort rather than Sway.
Rhi: Mhmm.
Josie: Yeah, we might as well do a group action about it.
Rhi: Okay. Who wants to take point on that?
Josie: I’ll volunteer to lead it, even if I don’t have the best rating.
Rhi: So, we had a 1 and two 4s?
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Yup.
Rhi: Okay. So, your result is a 4, and Minx is gonna take a point of stress.
He nods a little bit and thinks.
Rhi (as Amancio): Oh. Oh, is this the auction that The Hive is putting on?
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Amancio): Yes, yes, uh, one moment!
Rhi: He just runs out of the room and is gone for a lot longer than one moment. His servant comes back with the tea.
Minna: What kind of tea is it?
Rhi: It’s not mushroom tea. God, it’s gotta be…
Kim: Chamomile.
Rhi: No, I want it to be some kind of herb that you do not typically make tea out of. [laugh]
Kim: Oh.
Minna: So, not mint either. [laugh]
Rhi: [laughing] No. ‘Cause he doesn’t—
Minna: It’s basil! It’s basil tea! [laughter]
Kim: Oh, gross. Okay.
Rhi: [laughing] Mhmm!
Josie and Madge: [laughter]
Rhi: It’s a basil tea. Eventually, shortly after you’ve been delivered your tea, he comes back with a thick paper-stuffed ledger and, again, moves some planters aside so he can set it down and flip it.
Rhi (as Amancio): Ah, yes! Yes. So, I was actually sent some invitations for that, but… nothing really there that interested me, initially. Unfortunately, I only have two invitations.
Minna (as Myra): Ah.
Kim (as Blaire): So, we get a trench coat…
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi (as Amancio): I like the way you think. But I can give you these two—I’m not going to use them.
Rhi: He hands the two invitations to Myra.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi (as Amancio): You’re very welcome. Uh, hm. Dare I ask what interests you, why you want to go?
Minna (as Myra): Oh, just something for a friend.
Rhi: He pauses for a moment and looks at you.
Rhi (as Amancio): Very well. What do you think of the tea? I’ve never made tea with this particular plant before! How is it?
Minna (as Myra): It’s quite…
Josie (as Minx): Distinctive.
Minna (as Myra): Aromatic.
Rhi (as Amancio): Ah, wonderful! Wonderful. I shall serve it to all my guests!
Josie (as Minx): Excellent. I’m sure they will be intrigued by it.
Rhi: [laugh] You all say, having taken a sip of tea, and then not touched it since.
Josie: Mhmm.
Kim: Oh, I threw mine into a plant.
Rhi: [laughter]
Minna: We drink mushroom tea. I’m pretty sure Myra’s still drinking it. [laughter]
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: Oh, God.
Okay. The invitations that you have, it is only for two of you, but it has a location, a start time, all of that stuff.
Josie: Excellent.
## [00:31:47] Entry
Kim: Could we forge two more invitations based on the two we already have?
Rhi: That’s a good point.
Josie: Mhmm.
Minna: That is a good point.
Kim: If that’s a Study roll, I wouldn’t mind attempting that, ‘cause I have 2 in Study.
Josie: Ooh.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, I think we’ve done Study for forgery before. Yeah, you could absolutely try to do that.
Kim: All right.
Minna: If you want, we could even do a group roll about it.
Kim: Ooh, yeah. I’ll lead it. 5.
Minna: Good. You take a point of stress from me. I’m sorry.
Kim: It’s okay.
Josie: [laughter]
Minna: It’s all I contributed. [laughter]
Kim: I’ll live. [chuckle]
Rhi: I’ll say that with that, you’re able to come up with two pretty solid forgeries.
Minna: I love the idea that Myra and Blaire just hunched over a table together for like—
Madge: Mhmm.
Kim: Just very carefully inking.
Minna: A couple of hours. I feel like it’s a Social plan with the connection being invitations.
Rhi: Okay. So, Social plan engagement roll.
Josie: We roll a 1. Bazso’s there again. [chuckle]
Rhi: Well, I did roll a 1.
Josie: Hurray. [laughing] Goddamn it.
## [00:32:40] The score
Rhi: So! On the day and time of the auction, you all show up at the doors. The guards who are there take your invitations, the forgeries get you through; it’s no problem. And you head down a very dark flight of stairs into a large, surprisingly well-lit and fairly well-decorated warehouse basement. There’s a bar that’s been set up. It’s obviously not a permanent installation, it’s just been set up for this event. There’s a number of tables with chairs scattered around. There’s a lot of people just mingling already, and chatting. There’s, let’s say, a string quartet playing near the bar, so there’s some light music filling the air. There’s a small stage near the front with a podium and a small table where, presumably, the auction will actually occur. You’re each able to get a drink, look around the room, hang out for a few minutes.
Then, Myra, you feel it first, but all four of you feel it pretty quickly. It gets very cold.
Josie: Oh dear.
Minna: Hmm…
Rhi: And Myra, you feel a presence behind you. It’s that feeling you get when it feels like somebody’s standing behind you—the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You hear a voice say in your ear:
Rhi (as Voice): You’ve got no charms or contracts to stop me now. I’m going to take what I want.
Rhi: And that Red Sashes ghost from the embassy is gonna try to possess you, Myra.
Kim: [gasp]
Josie: [gasp] Oh shit.
Minna: Wait, do I not have my spiritbane charm?
Rhi: You do, but—
Minna: It won’t stop them?
Rhi: The way that I think about spiritbane charms is that it requires some will behind it.
Minna: Okay. So, what am I rolling? Is it an Attune?
Rhi: I think that this is just gonna be you’re resisting a consequence. This ghost got the drop on you and is now trying to possess you.
Minna: Well, is it at least Resolve?
Rhi: Yes, it’s Resolve.
Minna: That’s much better than rolling Attune. 6! I take no stress!
Madge: Woo!
Rhi: Tell me how you resist this ghost.
Minna: I think Myra, to some extent, has trained to avoid this. It’s not like it’s had to be tested a lot, but I think, I don’t know, she has kind of learned to close her mind to intruders. This ghost did get the drop on her, but I think she quickly gathers herself and her mind clangs shut like iron doors.
Rhi: The ghost recoils, but is still there.
Minna (as Myra): Unluckily for you, I have my self to protect myself.
Rhi: The ghost, which you, unless you’re looking into the ghost field, can’t see. But you all hear the low, angry hiss. The cold increases a bit, and some of the tablecloths and things start to flutter like there’s a breeze.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear.
Kim: Can I whip on my spirit mask?
Rhi: Yeah. You can put on your spirit mask and try to Attune.
Kim: Oh no. [laugh] I got 1s on both of them.
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you put on the mask, and the ghost’s attention snaps to you.
Rhi (as Ghost): Fine. Then I’ll take this one!
Rhi: The ghost is gonna try to possess you.
Josie: [laugh]
Kim: Oh, great. Okay, what am I rolling?
Madge and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: It’s gonna be Resolve.
Kim: Okay. 6.
Rhi: Okay. You also are just like “no!”
Kim (as Blaire): No. Fuck off!
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, Myra? What is going on?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, you know. A friend stopped by.
Josie (as Minx): Do I have time to clutch my spiritbane charm?
Rhi: Yeah. At this point, when they say that, Minx and Phin, you’re both able to be like “mm!”
Madge: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): I was not expecting to need these just yet.
Rhi: I think at this point, you guys might be starting to draw a little attention from the crowd. People aren’t seeing the ghost, but you all are acting distressed, and—
Josie (as Minx): Um, excuse me. I’m gonna go get a drink.
Rhi: So, Minx, you’re just trying to remove yourself from the situation?
Josie: Yes. If you see something, say nothing and drink to forget. [chuckle]
Rhi: All right. Phin, what are you doing?
Madge: I’m already leaving at this point. I’m just backing away from the situation so that I can collect and come at it from a different perspective, maybe.
Rhi: Okay. That works. Blaire, are you still looking through the ghost field at the ghost?
Kim: I think at this point, I probably have taken my mask off, now that I’ve realized that we’re drawing attention to ourselves, much as I would like talk to her. But common sense for once out-rules.
Rhi: I think at this point I’m gonna have a clock for the guards that’re posted down here coming to investigate. Right now, you’re at 2 out of 4.
Josie: Oh God.
Rhi: I think at this point the ghost lets out a frustrated screech.
Rhi (as Ghost): Fine. If I can’t have any of you, then I’ll take her!
Rhi: And points at some random person. You can kind of feel the cold moving in that direction. There is a chance to intervene. Somebody’s gonna have to do something to—
Kim: Oh, can I stop her?
Rhi: Tell me how you’re gonna do it.
Kim: I’m gonna try trapping her in a jar. Blaire always carries empty jars with her for this purpose.
Rhi: [laugh]
Kim: Yeah, I don’t wanna see anyone get possessed at this auction. Nope, I got a 5. I rolled Attune.
Rhi: 5?
Kim: Yup. I’m going with that.
Rhi: Okay. You open the jar; you snap out with the chain that is attached to the jar. It wraps around the ghost, there’s another screech, and you haul it into the jar. You close the lid, wrap the chain back around, and you’re like “yes! Got it!” And you look up, and there’s four guards heading over.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: Minx and Phin, you two are not currently pulling any attention from the guards. You have backed off enough that they’re just focusing on Blaire and Myra.
Josie: Can I whisper to Phin something?
Josie (as Minx): Should we go for the old drunken scuffle, draw their attention?
Madge (as Phin): Possibly. I’m wondering if attracting attention is a good thing at this point, ‘cause if we get kicked out, then we can’t help them.
Madge: Phin, at least, is going to hang back, because there is a job that they need to do here.
Josie: Actually, I think what I’d like to do is start socializing a bit and try to gossip, and keep the patrons from noticing the situation.
Rhi: Go ahead and give me a roll to see how successful you are at that. At this point, the situation has reduced back to risky.
Josie: Okay. I’m gonna roll me some Sway. I got a 6.
Rhi: There’s some people who are starting to look. You come over and start chatting with them about the auction and the things that’re up for sale, and that sort of thing. However, there are four guards who walk up. The lead guard walks right up to Blaire.
Rhi (as Guard): What are you doing? Why did you just have a spirit jar out? Was there a spirit here?
Kim (as Blaire): I, uh… Yeah. Yeah, there was a spirit here. I saw her. She was about to possess someone. I– I had to do something.
Rhi: There’s a moment of confusion amongst the guards as they look at each other and then look back at you. There’s a little bit of murmuring. You hear one of them say:
Rhi (as Guard): She’s obviously not a Warden.
Minna (as Myra): She just saved one of your patrons. I think you would like to thank her as opposed to whatever else you were trying to do.
Rhi (as Guard): Oh… [sigh] This is an unusual situation.
Kim (as Blaire): I understand.
Rhi: One of them looks at the jars.
Rhi (as Guard): It’s contained in there?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes. Completely.
Rhi: There’s a little more murmuring amongst them.
Rhi (as Guard): Can you take it out somewhere and get rid of it? We’d rather not have the—
Kim (as Blaire): Now?
Rhi (as Guard): We’ll let you back in. The auction’s not gonna start for a bit. You’ve got your invitation; you’ll be allowed back in. But just…
Josie: [squeak]
Rhi (as Guard): For the safety of everyone here…
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: I think a couple of the guards will break off to walk Blaire back upstairs—not in a, like, “we’re watching you” sense.
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna ask if Blaire wants her to come with, or…
Kim: No, this is all right. I got this.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: Where are you gonna go to stash it? [chuckle]
Kim: Yeah, no, ‘cause I’m not releasing this thing until I get to The Deathlands.
Rhi: Yeah. They just walk you up to the street and then expect you to walk off somewhere.
Kim: I am just going to clip this jar back to my belt and keep it hidden behind my cloak.
Madge: [bursting laughter]
Minna: [laughter]
Kim: Hope they don’t notice and hang onto it for the rest of the night, bring it home, and then, my next errand to The Deathlands, then I’ll release it.
Rhi: You’re probably gonna need to be gone for a little bit, though, to—
Kim: Well, yeah. I go out for a little walk.
Rhi: Jumping back inside, I think Minx is still working the crowd a bit, keeping people from asking too many questions about who just got escorted out by the guards. Myra and Phin, what do you two wanna do?
Minna: I think we should scout around to see if we can find out where the items are being kept.
Madge: Yes, I agree with that.
Rhi: There’s the stage where the auction’s gonna be held, and then there’s a door off to the side near the stage, where, presumably, it makes sense that that’s where items would be brought through.
Minna: There’s probably people watching the door, right?
Rhi: Yeah. There’s a couple guards on the door.
Minna: So we gotta get past them, basically.
Madge: Basically, yeah.
Minna: We could distract them somehow?
Madge (as Phin): We could flirt with them.
Minna: Wait, does Phin actually suggest that in character? [laugh]
Madge: Yeah. Very deadpan.
Everyone: [laughter]
Minna (as Myra): Who… would flirt with them?
Madge (as Phin): I don’t know. It’s usually a plan that works, but, um… No. I think what we should do is we should at the very least strike up a conversation with them and make it seem like something more dangerous and more of a threat is happening elsewhere. Or, if something more intriguing is happening…
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I think that’s probably our best bet.
Rhi: Okay. You two make your way over. The guards there, one of them, she gives you a polite nod.
Rhi (as Guard): Sorry. The auction’s gonna be starting in about 10 minutes. If you can stay back from the stage, though…
Rhi: You’ll need to roll something to get the guards’ attention.
Minna: I only have 1 in Sway.
Rhi: Do you wanna do a group action? ‘Cause, if I recall, Phin, you’ve got 1 in Sway as well.
Minna: Yes, please.
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: I can lead it this time.
Madge: Okay.
Minna: Hey! I got a 6.
Rhi: Nice.
Madge: That’s good, ‘cause I got a 2.
Rhi: You got a 6, so you’re gonna be able to lure them away. What do you say to convince them that they should leave their posts?
Minna (as Myra): I do believe I saw a fight brewing over there. I don’t know, there were people speaking in very hushed tones, and—
Madge (as Phin): One of them definitely looked drunk and disorderly.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Josie: Can I do a flashback to help out here?
Minna: Yes!
Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Can the flashback just be: we discussed this beforehand?
Rhi: Mhmm. That’s an easy enough thing I’ll give that one to you for no stress.
Josie: Ooh!
Rhi: Are you gonna start acting drunk and disorderly?
Josie: Yes. And I’ll deliberately start a political argument with someone. Like:
Josie (as Minx): You truly think Severos is in the right here?
Josie: Just some obscure, bullshit thing. And we’re getting louder and louder about it.
Rhi: Okay. They look over and one of them is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, dammit, we cannot have this here, not after last time!
Rhi: They head over.
Rhi (as Guard): Hey. Hey! Keep it– Calm down! This is a civilized place. There’s—
Rhi: They just start reprimanding the crowd, generally. But the door is there.
Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: And open for the two of you.
Minna: We are going to slide on through there.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: All the guards’ shouting pulls the attention of most of the people in the room, so the two of you just slide on through that door.
Kim: Am I back at this point?
Rhi: I think, yeah. We’re gonna cut over to, as the guards calm down the crowd, and I imagine either Minx or the person she was arguing with has stormed off in a huff, Blaire. You come back in with the guards being like:
Rhi (as Guard): I don’t… Do you know why there was a spirit here? Do you think there’s gonna be more?
Kim (as Blaire): No. And also, no. I feel like this is a one time thing.
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, I hope so. Ugh.
Kim (as Blaire): Try not to stress about it.
Rhi (as Guard): [grunt] Okay.
Josie and Rhi: [laughter]
Rhi: They bring you back in and you are able to locate Minx.
## [00:45:15] Blaire and Minx
Josie: Who just cannot believe that any civilized person supports the former Iruvian occupation policy.
Rhi: [laugh]
Kim (as Blaire): What did you do just now?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, I was just informing these apparently less polite society folks of proper politics, as a means of—
Kim (as Blaire): No! What? [whispering] Why would you do– What are we doing?
Josie (as Minx): [whispering] It’s so they could get in the door. I pulled the guards off.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s what I wanted to know!
Josie and Rhi: [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): But yes, now I do believe patience shall be our virtue here. We simply need to secure safe passage.
Rhi: Where are the two of you hanging out right now?
Josie: I’m gonna be grumpily nursing a drink at the bar.
Kim: Maybe I’ll be at the bar.
Josie: I’ll talk with Blaire, but pretend like I’ve never really fully calmed down, so they have to keep an eye on me.
Rhi: Yeah, still complaining.
Josie: Mhmm.
Rhi: Minx, I’ve got a question for you.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Have you ever met Nyryx’s employer? The woman who runs The Red Lamp?
Josie: Oh. Probably in passing, at some point; just, like, seeing her around.
Rhi: And you would certainly know the name Madame Tesslyn. There’s some murmurs and gasps from the door. You look over, and a very striking woman with light skin, dark hair cut into a very fashionable, just about chin-length cut, wearing a beautifully-tailored gown and a fur stole, with jewelry that is simple but clearly very expensive, accompanied by a pair of very fit and very attractive guards—private guards—strolls in. That’s Madame Tesslyn; that’s the woman who owns the brothel where Nyryx works.
Josie: Oh, jeez. Uh, wow.
Josie (as Minx): Well, she is quite striking.
Rhi: She surveys the room, and then walks over to one of the empty tables. One of her guards pulls out a chair for her, and the other one heads off to the bar and orders a couple drinks. You’re close enough to hear the bartender hands over and is like:
Rhi (as Bartender): They’re on the house.
Josie: Really?
Rhi: Yup.
Josie: Huh. Okay. But she doesn’t seem to recognize me, or anything?
Rhi: Nah.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: She sees a lot of people.
Josie: Indeed.
Rhi: You don’t stand out in her mind, too much. But she is present.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: I think, with that, ‘cause we’re getting close to the auction starting but before the auction starts, we need to determine where the infiltration team is at, so let’s cut back over to Myra and Phin.
## [00:47:55] Myra and Phin
Rhi: You two have gotten through the door. This part of the warehouse basement looks like a warehouse basement. There’s a lot of shelves and crates and things; just a lot of storage space down here. There’s a lot of stuff—nothing that immediately jumps out at you as, like, “ah, the auction items.” You know, there’s not a crate that is labeled “Spirit Warden uniforms.”
Minna: Yeah. I think I’d like to start looking. I think that’s probably gonna look more like Survey than Study, just because I have to look things over very quickly. Can I push myself here?
Rhi: You absolutely can.
Minna: Can I mark down this stress before I roll?
Rhi: Mhmm.
Minna: Actually, what’s a Devil’s Bargain look like, just out of curiosity?
Rhi: Yeah, lemme think… So, you guys aren’t the only ones who’ve snuck back here. Clave, one of Salia’s other kids—
Minna: Fuck. Yes.
Rhi: Is back here.
Minna: Definitely. [laughter]
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Eee! I rolled a 5.
Rhi: Here’s what happens: the two of you set off into this little maze of storage stuff, looking around it. It seems to be a lot of random machine parts, there’s some dried foodstuffs; it’s just sort of a hodgepodge of random things. Then, towards one of the back walls, there’s basically a big caged off area; goes all the way up to the ceiling; big, iron cage. There’s a door in the center of the cage with a pair of guards on that, as well. As the two of you are moving up to see, you hear a [gasp] from behind you, and turn to see… What does Clave look like?
Minna: I think I imagine her with very pale, blonde hair, to the point where her eyebrows are a little odd-looking against her skin; blue eyes; looks a lot more delicate than she really is.
Rhi: Okay. You turned around, and she is clearly in mid-sneak. The two of you stare at each other.
Rhi (as Clave): Myra?
Minna: I think Myra just goes really stiff. Then she rushes towards Clave and pushes her out of anywhere where anyone would see them.
Rhi: Phin, do you have a… [laugh]
Madge: [laughing] Yeah. I think it’s out of the corner of… Like, Myra’s in front of me, and then all of a sudden she’s moved out of my field of vision, and it’s like:
Madge (as Phin): Myra…?
Minna (as Myra): [whispering] Back here!
Madge (as Phin): Okay, okay.
Madge: I’m gonna go over.
Rhi: You guys are around the side of a shelf. Clave has shaken your hand off.
Rhi (as Clave): What are you doing here?
Minna (as Myra): What are you doing here?
Rhi (as Clave): I’m working.
Minna (as Myra): So am I!
Rhi (as Clave): Doing what?
Minna (as Myra): As if that’s any of your business.
Madge (as Phin): Hi. I’m curious, sorry. Um, nice to meet you. Phin. Am I allowed to introduce myself to this person, Myra?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know if you want to introduce yourself to this person. She’s not exactly the kind of person you’d like to know.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I don’t wanna know half the people I know, so there is that. Who are you?
Rhi (as Clave): [sighing] Clave. Myra and I used to work together, until she got too full of herself and ran off.
Minna (as Myra): Not full of myself. And I didn’t run off. I went off to start working on my own.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, and that’s turned out pretty good for her.
Rhi (as Clave): Yeah, I’ll bet.
Madge (as Phin): Excuse me?
Rhi (as Clave): What, precisely, have you accomplished without Salia and the rest of us? Nothing that I’ve heard of.
Josie: [laughter]
Minna (as Myra): You have heard of it, I promise you, if you read the Doskvol Daily.
Madge (as Phin): [laughing] Oh my gosh! [laugh] Oh, that’s really good. Like she said, Doskvol Daily. She created The Magpies with me, and that’s gone pretty well for her.
Rhi: She raises an eyebrow.
Rhi (as Clave): That’s you.
Madge (as Phin): That’s us.
Minna: I think Myra pulls a pin from her pocket and flicks it to Clave.
Minna (as Myra): My regards to Salia.
Rhi: She catches it and looks.
Rhi (as Clave): Are you going to get in my way?
Madge (as Phin): No, but you’re not gonna get in ours.
Minna (as Myra): If you don’t get in my way, I won’t get it yours.
Minna: Oh my gosh, they’re so in sync right now.
Kim: Oh, good.
Josie, Kim, Madge, and Myra: [laughter]
Madge: I’m gonna put my hand against Clave’s chest and push her back until she’s against the wall.
Rhi: Yeah. She lets you do it, but is glaring, and, you can tell, is shifting her stance. If you push this too far, she is gonna strike back.
Madge: She can certainly try!
Rhi: Yeah. [laugh]
Madge (as Phin): You’re gonna stay right here and you’re not gonna tell a single soul that you saw us.
Rhi (as Clave): Well, if I told anyone that I saw you, then I’d be revealing that I was back here too.
Madge (as Phin): Not even to Salia. No one at all is going to know that we were back here.
Rhi (as Clave): Or what?
Madge (as Phin): It’s gonna be pretty hard to talk with what I’m about to do to you.
Madge: And I’m gonna punch her in the throat.
Josie and Kim: [pained, astonished noises]
Rhi: [bursting laughter] Okay. I’m not even gonna make you roll for it. You’ve got the drop on her here that you just… Actually, well, no, you know what, I take that back. It’s gonna be controlled, but she might make enough noise that this could attract some attention.
Madge: Mhmm. I’m gonna use Command with my Savage special ability.
Rhi: Oh, okay! Yeah.
Madge: And on top of that, I’m gonna push myself. 6!
Rhi: Excellent. Yeah. You just snap out, punch her in the throat, and she:
Rhi (as Clave): [choking gasps]
Rhi: And is doing that clutching her throat coughing silently thing, and is doubled over.
Madge (as Phin): Have fun. [laugh]
Rhi: Yeah. She’s still just one hand on the wall to hold herself up, coughing. Yeah, so… that’s been dealt with. [laugh]
Josie and Madge: [laughter]
Minna: Bless you, Phin.
Rhi: But I think, at this point, you hear a door slam shut, and then you see a handful of guards come up through the shelves, carrying a number of boxes and crates and things in various sizes, as the auction is about to begin.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us, and an extra thank you to everyone who has left us iTunes reviews, tweeted at us, or shared the show with their friends.
Next month is International Podcast Month, and in celebration Tess of RPG Casts and I Am Here has organized a really cool event: one-shot actual plays and audio drama episodes that will air every day all through September. You can find the full list of people involved at InternationalPodcastMonth.com. I got to play in a very cool Legend of Zelda inspired game, and Minna helped run a Harry Potter themed game of Fiasco. There are tons of great creators involved, so definitely keep an eye on that.
Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Josie: The Sylvia Rivera Law Project is a collective organization that works to provide legal help to transgender, intersex, and gender non-conforming people, especially those that are low income or people of color. Trans and intersex people, especially queer trans POC face significant discrimination and difficulty in making sure they are accurately and fairly represented under the law, and the current administration has only increased these risks. The SRLP provides assistance in seeking name and gender form changes and legal representation as well as advocating for the rights of transgender prisoners. To learn more or make a donation visit SRLP.org.
Rhi: And of course, please continue to visit 5calls.org to call your representatives, and make sure that you KNOW you’re registered to vote. We’re getting close to the midterm elections, and voting the republicans out of power in congress is our best chance of slowing down the harm they’re doing to our country.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:01:54]
Rhi: So, Phin and Myra are still in the back of this warehouse where The Hive is hosting a black market auction. The auction itself is about to start. Blaire and Minx, I assume you two are still hanging out up at the bar.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. As you are kind of nursing your drinks, the door that Myra and Phin had previously gone through opens and a very well-dressed person in like vest and button up shirt and a flowing lacy skirt comes up to the podium and says very loudly, in a voice that carries through the room:
Rhi (as Auctioneer): If I can have everyone’s attention, the auction is about to begin.
Rhi: There’s sort of a collective murmuring, and people are pulling out their envelopes with the invitations which contain their bid number cards. One of the guards sets up something large and cloth-covered on the table and then steps back and removes the cloth. It is a pair of framed paintings. There’s one that is like a cityscape, kind of a scene from far away, like it’s just this shimmer of light in the darkness and then distantly behind it is a glowing volcano. The other is just like a desert scape scene with just these rolling dunes of black sand and the stars above. They are both beautiful.
Rhi (as Auctioneer): We will begin the auction with a pair of exquisite pieces by the Iruvian artist Kamali Rachana. These pieces were claimed from Mylera Clev, the former leader of The Red Sashes…
Rhi: There’s just sort of murmuring, and a couple people laugh scornfully at the mention of the now destroyed Red Sashes.
Rhi (as Auctioneer): These are original works, highly valued, and we will start the bidding at—
NICK: And she names a price in silver coins. Minx…
Josie: Uh-huh… [laughs]
Rhi: You really want these paintings.
Josie: I do. [laughing] I really do~
Rhi: You really want these paintings. Kind of without thinking about it, you’ve got that bid number card in your hand.
Josie: Yeah…
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, no.
Rhi: In order to avoid…
Josie: Uh-huh…
Rhi: If you want to, if you want to basically resist your vice just taking the reins here, and you spending a lot of money that you may or may not have, you are going to need to roll Resolve to resist this, because basically you are just like, you want these, you want these a lot.
Josie: I mean, I don’t think I’m going to resist. I would like to see if there’s a way where I can bid well, to avoid getting in too deep, but Minx is like okay, this is my mission now.
Rhi: [laughs] I will give you the option of that resistance not just going away if you change your mind later, like okay Minx is gonna try to rein it in, you can do that, but yeah. You can just sorta roll with this for now. The bidding started at about 2 coin.
Josie: Oh geez. Okay. There is also the problematic fact that I don’t keep a whole lot of coin on me. Most of it is in my stash.
Rhi: Well, this kind of auction, most people don’t bring that kind of money with them, because that’s asking to get robbed. It’s the sort of thing where you bid, you agree to pay for it, and then they’ll hold it until you come by later with the money, and if you don’t come by later with the money they’ll just put it up for auction again.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: So yeah. That’s the thing. Whatever you have in your coin purse is not necessarily going to constrain you on how much money you spend today.
Josie: Yep. Minx is bidding in. she goes into this thinking all right, well I can probably make it out of here with something but surely I should be disciplined first bid.
Rhi: I think what I’m gonna have you do is give me a Lifestyle roll, which is you roll however many rows of your stash you have marked.
Josie: One. [laughs]
Rhi: Somebody else in the crowd… You kind of start to get into a bidding war with this person. It’s one of those things where it goes back and forth by increments of 50 or 100 for a little bit, and then this person is clearly getting really annoyed with you and jumps it up by like 1,000, like pushing it from 2 coin to 3 coin.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: Are you gonna push that, or are you gonna let them have this one?
Josie: I think I would like to make a resistance roll.
Rhi: [laughs] To see if you can?
Josie: To see whether I do or not. It gave me a 4.
Rhi: Okay. that means you can take 2 stress to stop. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah. I think Minx is gonna come to her senses, but it’s just gonna be like:
Josie (as Minx): I really wanted those. Come on…
Kim (as Blaire): Let it go.
Rhi: [laughs] Blaire’s just like, comforting shoulder pat.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Minx’s body language is totally transparent this whole time, by the way. She perks up and like goes through the stages of grief at every bid, stuff like that.
Rhi: So, those paintings are won by that other person and are taken aside.
Josie: One thing I do want to note is what I can get of the identities of the people who win bids.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. So, most of them are not being identified by name, they’re being identified by bid number. This person wasn’t anybody who you really recognize. You do see as you’re glancing around now that you’re not transfixed by the art, you can see one of the other people who was bidding, who is at one of the tables further up, who you’re guessing by the black crow feathers that everybody’s got on, that’s Lydia and her entourage from The Crows.
You do recognize kind of off to the side, Roslyn, who is The Dimmer Sisters’ servant.
Josie: Oh. Interesting.
Rhi: A lot of the people here are a mix of low-level nobility and mid-level criminals. This is not a super, super high end event. You do note that Madam Tesslyn did not bid on those pieces at all. there are some additional art pieces. You now have enough self-control that you can choose whether or not you want to bid.
Josie: Uh-huh… Hmm. I think I kinda wanna go in on all of them, but see if I win or not.
Rhi: Just give me three Lifestyle rolls. We’ll just say that’s kind of an abstraction of your various bids.
Josie: Okay. I’ve got a 4, a 6, and a 3.
Rhi: Okay. that 6, I’m gonna say you win something on that.
Josie: Sweet.
Rhi: And, it’s gonna cost you… 2 coin. It’s a small painting, but it’s highly detailed. It looks like it’s depicting a scene out in The Deathlands; dead trees with branches reaching up towards the sky, and then there’s some kind of creature, it’s hard to make out the details because it’s just sort of a shadowy form and glowing eyes, at the foot of the trees, and the artist is simply known as Rafello.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: You do manage to win that piece of art, and it’s held for you to collect after the auction, but they take down your bid number and everything.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: There’s some other stuff, like there’s a case of military grade explosives that gets brought up.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And then eventually someone brings up a small scroll case that is described as a map containing the location of several spirit wells in and around Duskwall.
Kim: [exhales]
Rhi: And for the first time in this whole action, Madam Tesslyn sits forward and joins in the bidding.
Josie: Ooh, okay.
Kim: Oh… no. What is the bidding starting at?
Rhi: [laughs] This is gonna be 3 coin.
Kim: Fuck. I have 3 coin. All right. A note.
Rhi: And, she does end up winning that.
Kim: Oh-
Josie: Ooh.
Kim: Mm-hmm-hmm. Why would she want that?
Rhi: For quite a bit of money. Her and Roslyn from The Dimmer Sisters get into a bidding war at the end, but Tesslyn ends up winning out. While this is all happening, in the back warehouse area guards are kind of ferrying things back and forth up to the door. Phin and Myra, you see people start carrying stuff up. What do you wanna do?
Minna: When you say we see people start carrying stuff you mean that they’re starting to leave the caged area?
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, packages are being carried out of the caged area back to the door that you came in, and kind of from what you hear as people are walking past is coordinating the logistics of moving the items up at the correct time.
Minna: Sorry. How many guards again?
Rhi: There’s two that are stationed at the cage, and then there’s just a handful, probably three or four, that are going back and forth carrying stuff.
Minna: Okay. I’m trying to think what the best way to handle this would be…
Rhi: The guards are wearing uniforms, if that helps.
Minna: Oh shit. Yeah.
Madge: Are they close to our sizes?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I think you can spot some that are. Yeah.
Minna: Let’s do it.
Madge: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. How do you wanna do that?
Madge: I think what Phin is gonna do, at least for hers, is wait until one of them is coming back to actually fetch an item and like punch him to knock him out.
Rhi: [giggles] Okay.
Madge: So, I would roll something for that, probably.
Rhi: You could roll Skirmish or Prowl, since you’re kind of ambushing this person.
Madge: I’m gonna use Skirmish for it. I got 3.
Rhi: Oh geez.
Madge: [laughing] My plan!
Rhi: You jump out to punch this guy, and as you’re like mid-lunge another guard comes running up and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Hey! They just told us that we need to bring the—Who the hell are you?!
Madge: [laughs]
Rhi: You’ve been spotted and are now in a desperate position.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Myra, what are you doing at this point?
Minna: Gonna go for the guard that is attacking Phin.
Rhi: Well, so nobody’s actually attacking Phin right now. Phin attempted to punch a guy and kind of got interrupted by a guy who is yelling. There’s confusion and shouting at this point.
Minna: Oh. Have they seen me at all, or can I have been hiding?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Okay. I’m gonna come up behind that guy and wrap a soaked handkerchief in front of his face.
Rhi: [laughs] yep.
Minna: I have absolutely nothing in Skirmish, so what’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: I can go with this one from John Harper himself: You can’t resist the consequences of this roll. If there are consequences to this roll, you are not allowed to roll to resist them.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: Okay?
Minna: Yep. Aaaah! … I rolled a 1. [laughs]
Kim: Nooo!
Rhi: Ah geez.
Minna: RIP my audio, sorry. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay! You go to grab the guy, but he’s just a lot taller and better trained at this than you, and he just whips around and basically throws you and you kind of slam into the wall and crack your head against it. This is gonna be level 2 harm, Concussion. The situation is beginning to spiral out of control. It took you guys a while to get to this point, though.
Madge: It is time for me to, um… [giggles] Gosh.
Josie: Might I suggest punching?
Madge: Yeah. I’m… I want to do punching, but I also want to do high efficiency punching.
Rhi: I mean, you can try to get both of them in one go, it’s just gonna—
Madge: [excited] That’s what I want. I think, with that, could I do it with my manacles and chain or would I have to have a scary weapon or tool?
Rhi: No. I mean- What are you wanting to do with the manacles and chain, trip them, cuff them together?
Madge: Trip them and then cuff them together. [laughs] First I want to damage, and then I want to capture.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. I think you can do that. They’re not terribly far apart so that’s not an impossible thing, but this is a desperate roll, so mark experience.
Madge: Okay. I got a 6 and a 5, and two 4s.
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Okay, 6 it is. Yeah. Describe how you’re able to do this. I think with this roll you’re able to trip them and cuff them in whatever manner you see fit.
Madge: So, full disclosure for the future audience, right before this session I went and I saw Infinity War so I still have a lot of marvel influence in my brain. [others giggle] I want to almost do a Spidy thing…
Kim: Yes!
Madge: …where I sling the chain out to knock both of them off their feet.
Rhi: Yeah, just kind of like whip it out around their ankles and pull them down?
Madge: Yeah. Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah! They had both been reaching for weapons so they weren’t moving, and it catches them both around the ankles. It’s almost like a momentary three-legged race where their legs get yanked together.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: They get thrown completely off balance and both go face first onto the floor. You’re able to run over and manacle their- I assume you’re gonna manacle them together?
Madge: Uh-huh. Front to front.
[laughter]
Kim: Oh my gods.
Rhi: Of course, the only way to tie people together.
Kim: Kiss. Kiss. Kiss!
Rhi: [laughs] Listen. I will come up with a whole narrative about what happens to these two guards while they’re chained up front to front in here. You also, I assume—
Madge: Take their clothes?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. I’ll say that you’re able to, you know, stuff handkerchiefs in their mouths or something to keep them from yelling and you drag them off and take their uniforms, and then leave them tied up somewhere front to front.
Madge: Yep!
Rhi: [giggling] You two have guard uniforms. I assume you guys wanna head over to the cage?
Madge: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you get up there, and one of the guards who are there just kind of glances at you and starts to go to unlock it. One of them is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Wait, wait, wait. Who are you two?
Rhi: Because you’re not any of the guards who have been coming up here previously.
Madge: Um, yeah. Um…
Kim: [whispering] You’re interns.
Madge (as Phin): I’m Marisha. I’m an intern.
Minna (as Myra): Laura. We got here late.
Rhi: Yeah, you guys are gonna have to make a roll.
[laughter]
Minna: Sounds like a Sway, question mark?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Do you wanna do it as a group?
Minna: Yeah. I only have 1 in Sway.
Madge: Please?
Rhi: Yep. Who’s leading?
Madge: I’ll lead.
Rhi: All right.
Madge: Four.
Minna: Four.
Rhi: Okay! Four it is.
Rhi (as Guard): Everything okay back there when you were coming in? We heard some yelling, it sounded like.
Madge (as Phin): I dropped a box on my foot.
Rhi (as Guard): Uh-huh.
Madge (as Phin): It hurt. A lot.
Minna: [giggles nervously]
Rhi (as Guard): Right. Uh…
Madge (as Phin): Do you wanna see if it’s bruising? My toe’s like totally messed up.
Minna (as Myra): I-I hit my head…
Rhi (as Guard): Okay. this is not making me want to hand you any of the expensive, priceless, breakable stuff we’ve got in here. You understand that?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Maybe you could hand us some of the like non-breakable stuff? I saw that we had some Spirit Warden uniforms back there. We could carry those.
Rhi: … Shit. That’s so well-played. I have to do it! [laughter and clapping] But yeah, so you mention that, and one of the guard’s is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Ugh. Hang on, let me…
Rhi: And he like pulls out a list.
Rhi (as Guard): Yeah. We are- I think we’re getting to the end of this. Those were one of the last items. So, hang on.
Rhi: He goes into the cage and brings out a fairly large, long and kind of flat box. It’s like the kind of boxes that old wedding dresses are stored in.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s like that.
Rhi (as Guard): It’ll probably take both of you to carry this.
Madge (as Phin): No problem.
Rhi (as Guard): It’s not really breakable, but try not to drop it.
Rhi: He hands it to the both of you.
Madge: I fake like I’m gonna drop it, and then I catch it, and I give them a look.
Rhi: He just shakes his head.
Rhi (as Guard): I am going to be mentioning this to Captain Boatwright once we’re done here.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Report me.
Minna (as Myra): I think what my friend here means is that after this night is over you won’t have to deal with us anymore.
Rhi (as Guard): Yeah. I’m gonna make sure of it. Get going.
Rhi: So, the two of you have Spirit Warden uniforms.
Minna: Yeah!
Rhi: What would you like to do now?
Minna: I would like to abscond. [laughs]
Madge: From where we went in, is there like a side door that we could abscond through?
Rhi: You guys haven’t seen one yet, but like, there’s a point where when you’re walking away from the cage you’ll be out of their sight so you can turn a different direction and start looking.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But I think you’re gonna need to make probably another Survey roll. There is another entrance into this area, because they had to load everything in, you guys just have to find it.
Madge: Yeah! Let’s do that Survey roll! Just so you know, you’re gonna have to get better than a 1, because that’s what I rolled.
Minna: Agh! I got a 2!
Rhi: Yeah… So, you guys start wandering around with this big box, which isn’t super heavy but it’s awkward, and you’re making your way through the various shelves and things. Who is towards the front of the box?
Madge: I’ll be towards the front.
Rhi: Okay. You turn around another corner of shelves and come face to barrel with Clave aiming a pistol at your face.
Minna: Ohhh good.
Josie: Whoa…
Rhi: And we are gonna cut back over to the front room now!
Minna: Aaah!
Rhi: The auction is starting to wind down. The auctioneer looks over at the guards by the door and gives them a nod.
Rhi (as Auctioneer): And now for our final item of the evening. We have acquired a set of four—
Rhi: And then the door opens and one of the guards rushes back in and whispers in the auctioneer’s ear really urgently, and then suddenly the auctioneer’s eyes go wide, and then they look back over. You’re too far away to hear but there’s just panicked whispering.
Rhi (as Auctioneer): Um, ahem. Uh… Give us a moment, um, everyone. We’ve had a bit of a delay with the last item. Please, everyone, remain in your seats and we’ll conclude the auction shortly.
Rhi: Then the auctioneer and both of the guards who were on the door all rush through the door and go in. there’s suddenly a lot of rising murmur in the crowd where everyone’s like ‘what’s going on,’ ‘that’s supposed to be the uniforms,’ ‘did somebody steal them,’ and a lot of that sort of murmuring questions and things.
Kim (as Blaire): Sounds like that might be our cue.
Rhi: That said, yeah, there’s currently no one on the door.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, you wanna bail?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I think we should. Do you perhaps want to enlist our ghost friend to assist?
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean?!
Josie (as Minx): Well, I do think they’re quite good at providing a distraction.
Kim (as Blaire): She’s gonna possess someone. No!
Josie (as Minx): I mean, surely that’s only temporary.
Rhi: Yes, it’s temporary until the person who’s being possessed dies and the ghost moves on. [laughs]
Josie: Oh. Minx knows jack shit about ghosts. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): No. we’re not doing that. Let’s just sneak out of here.
Josie (as Minx): [huffs] Very well, very well.
Rhi: All right. How do you wanna do your sneaking?
Josie: You know, I don’t particularly want to sneak, I just kind of want to ac natural like I’m going to the bathroom or something.
Rhi: Ah, the ‘I’m supposed to be here?’
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: So you wanna do it as a Sway?
Josie: Yes. [laughing] That’s exactly what I’m saying.
Kim: Ooh. Actually, that works better, because I have a point in Sway.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Yeah! It’s gonna be risky.
Kim & Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: While there are no guards immediately on the door there are still guards in the room and there’s a lot of people. Are you doing this as a group action?
Josie: I’m free to lead it, if you want.
Kim: I got a 2.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Six.
Kim: Oh, thank God. I’m sorry. You’re gonna have to take stress.
Rhi: Yeah, you’ll take a point of stress
Josie: That’s okay.
Rhi: Yeah, you just super casually set down your drinks, make your way up through the crowd, kind of nod at a couple people, and just open the door and walk on through.
Josie: yeah.
Rhi: So, as with Myra and Phin, you find yourselves in a room full of shelves and crates and things, and you can hear shouting coming from somewhere further back in the room. The auctioneer’s going:
Rhi (as Auctioneer): What?! Well, where did they go if you gave them- They didn’t make it up to the-
Rhi: And the other guard who didn’t really talk to Myra and Phin is like:
Rhi (as Guard): I knew they weren’t new. I knew that they had to have been—
Rhi (as Auctioneer): Well then why didn’t you say something?!
Rhi: And there’s just a lot of yelling amongst the guards.
Rhi (as Auctioneer): Spread out and find them before they leave!
Rhi: What do you two wanna do?
Madge: We’re face to face with a gun right now?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. You two are currently frozen with a gun in your face.
Josie: I just wanna look for them, maybe prowling about it.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire?
Kim: Yeah, following.
Rhi: Do you want to Prowl, or do you want to do something else?
Kim: No, Prowl is fine.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Ooh, yay, I got a 6.
Kim: I got a 3.
Rhi: With all the shouting, you two sneak, sneak, sneak, and come upon this scene of Myra and Phin in guard uniforms carrying this large box between them with an unfamiliar blonde woman pointing a pistol at Phin’s face.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: Yeah, and Clave just…
Rhi (as Clave): [scratchy] Drop it.
Rhi: …and points at the box.
Josie: Can I put a pistol to Clave’s head?
Rhi: Clave is, unbeknownst to her, now flanked. So, yes, you can do that but you’re gonna have to roll to make sure she doesn’t hear you.
Josie: Okay. I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay. you get up behind her and you put the gun to her back, and she freezes and her eyes go really wide. Then, from behind Myra, another couple guards round the corner and go:
Rhi (as Guards): They’re here! We found them!
Josie (as Minx): Let’s run, dears.
[laughter]
Rhi: Well, so you’ve got… The guards are at one end of this hall of shelves, Blaire’s at the other end, and this is sort of the line-up between them with various people pointing various weapons.
Madge: Yeah, but you said these uniforms aren’t necessarily fragile, right?
Rhi: The Spirit Warden uniforms? No. They’re sturdy as hell.
Madge: Okay. Cool. I’m gonna drop the box and kick Clave.
Rhi: Okay. Do it.
Madge: And I’m doing it to cause massive damage, so I’m gonna do it as a Wreck.
Rhi: This is going to be risky, because she is pointing a gun at you, but she also has a gun pointed at her, so you know, things are a little complicated right now.
Madge: yeah. I’m gonna push myself to get a fourth die.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I got a critical.
Rhi: Nice!
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: Yeah. I think this is just, you’re gonna basically take her out of play with this.
Madge: Cool.
Rhi: How do you do that? It doesn’t necessarily have to be unconscious, but just in a state where she can’t interfere.
Madge: I wanna bust her kneecap with this kick.
Rhi: So, you kick her square in the knee, there’s a really nasty crunching sound, she falls over, and I’m gonna assume you grab her gun.
Madge: Yeah!
Rhi: Okay.
Madge (as Phin): Mine now.
Minna (as Myra): All right. Will somebody help me with this box?
Rhi: Well Myra, you do still have two guards behind you.
Minna: We’re going to run. … No? Aren’t we gonna run?
Josie: yeah. Uh-huh.
Madge: Yeah. I think we’re gonna run.
Kim: Let’s run.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I will help with the box again after I tuck the pistol away.
Rhi: There’s shouting behind you. The guards are running towards you. You all take off running. You guys still don’t know where the exit is.
Minna: Yeah, I was gonna say- Who has an out for us?
Madge: We have a perk for this, don’t we?
Rhi: Your underground passages.
Minna: That’s true.
Madge: Yeah, we have underground passages and also someone has a ghost key?
Kim: Oh! I do.
Rhi: Yeah. Somebody can pull out your maps of the area, that of course you brought, and figure out where there’s a secret way out of here.
Minna: I feel like Blaire is the one who has the maps, usually.
Kim: Probably.
Minna: Because Blaire has the key.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, yeah. Blaire, you’re able to look, as you guys are running you pull this out, ‘okay, okay, it’s over here,’ and there’s basically a storm cellar door type thing where it’s just the two doors that open and then it leads down. On your map it says it leads down to the canals, but I think somebody’s gonna need to do something to keep these guards from following you.
Josie: I was gonna say, can I pull my second pistol and just… I don’t know. I don’t even really wanna try to hit them, but I just wanna be like whenever we round a corner I fire some shots back, make it so they can’t just run after us.
Minna: Suppressing fire. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: Mmm, a 1 and a 3.
Rhi: Oof. Okay.
Minna: I have an idea. Can I have a lantern and break it so that a line of oil goes between us and then light that oil?
Rhi: Yes. You can totally do that, but I gotta resolve Minx’s bad roll first. Yes, I like that plan. Do you guys have ideas for what a consequence could be here?
Minna: It could be desperate position as now they’re gaining, because the covering fire didn’t work.
Madge: Yeah. I think it’s either we get into a desperate position or the opportunity to do covering fire without hurting anyone goes away. Like, any time we’re gonna try and shoot at these people it’s gonna be to hurt them.
Rhi: Yeah, okay. I like both of the options. Minx, I will let you pick which one you want.
Josie: I think we’re gonna be in a position where we can’t fight back without hurting people.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. They’ve gained on you so much that you kind of have to shoot them in order to do some damage. They’re closing in. Myra?
Minna: Okay. Myra, from under her coat, pulls out a small lantern and she breaks it. I might have to roll something to break it precisely in such a way that it’s going to roll across the distance between us.
Rhi: You’ll have to do some kind of roll to pull this off.
Minna: I think it’s gonna look like a Finesse, maybe?
Rhi: Yeah. I think you could Finesse this.
Minna: Because she’s trying to create a line of oil between them.
Rhi: Yeah. She’s trying to do something fairly precise.
Minna: So, I’m gonna do that. I’m also gonna push myself. I got a 5.
Rhi: I’m gonna say you have reduced effect. The line of oil and fire goes up, and it startles them back, but it doesn’t create the nice, neat wall of fire you were envisioning. They can get around it, but it buys you enough time. Everybody gets down into the canals. If somebody wants to do a flashback to have your good buddies, The Gondoliers…
Several: Yes.
Josie: Do the thing.
Rhi: Who’s got the stress?
Kim: I’ll take it. I’m doing real good on stress. I only have 1 stress so far.
Rhi: Okay. I’m gonna say that this is two stress, because you guys didn’t know exactly where you were going to be coming out when you went in, so for them to be here is kind of a… it’s a combination of planning ahead and sheer luck.
Kim: Yeah. I’ll take the 2 stress.
Rhi: It’s Kay. Kay came to pick you guys up.
Josie: Yay~
Madge: Yeah~
Rhi: We haven’t seen her for a bit. I think that as you guys get down there she is just pulling up.
Rhi (as Kay): Oh, good, there you are. I’ve been circling for—Okay! You’re in a rush! All right! We’ll go!
Josie (as Minx): Yes dear, quite.
Rhi (as You all pile into the gondola, and the doors up at the top of the stairs open, and there’s shouting. She very quickly pulls you guys off down the canal, and you make it away. So, let’s go into downtime.
## Downtime [0:30:00]
Rhi: Payoff: Basically this is just an exchange of goods for services. You are going to deliver this crate of uniforms to The Silver Nails and in exchange they will get you guys into The Lost District, but otherwise you don’t make any money on this score. Out of curiosity, Myra…
Minna: Yes?
Rhi: When Clave threw that Magpie pin back at you, did you pick it up or did you leave it?
Minna: Yeah. I picked it up. I didn’t actually say that, but I was definitely thinking that.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. I failed to ask, so that is going to change the heat on this. I think you’re only gonna take 2 heat. That said, you are still at 7 heat with a wanted level 1, so you’re still getting up there. [laughs]
Let’s see what everybody is doing in downtime. This time we will start with Blaire.
Kim: I’m gonna start with summoning Setarra again.
Rhi: Okay. How are you gonna go about getting her attention?
Kim: Mostly the same process I did last time, the ritual that I did, only this time I provided a larger source of sea water per her advice.
Rhi: [laughs] Yep. The sea water sort of burbles a little bit, and Setarra rises up out of it, and steps out looking faintly annoyed. She kind of looks down at you.
Rhi (as Setarra): What do you require?
Kim (as Blaire): I, um, I was wondering if you had any updates on that thing I gave you, if you knew anything about it.
Rhi: She tilts her head to the side, then seems to remember something.
Rhi (as Setarra): Oh… Yes.
Rhi: She makes a gesture with her hand and the acorn appears, and she just sort of tosses it at your feet.
Rhi (as Setarra): It is a seed for a tree that can no longer grow because the sun is dead. It is a waste of your time, and mine.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m sorry.
Rhi (as Setarra): It is called an acorn, if you care to know. It grew into a tree called an oak. Hopefully you are now spending your time on more worthwhile endeavors.
Kim (as Blaire): [weakly] I am. Don’t worry.
Rhi (as Setarra): Is there anything else you wanted me for, or is this it?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, no, that was, that was kind of it.
Rhi: She scoffs and turns back towards the basin of sea water.
Rhi (as Setarra): Focus on things that are more worthy of your time and talents. Call me when you have something useful.
Rhi: Then she steps into the sea water and disappears.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Rhi: You wanna pick up your acorn?
Kim: Yeah. Blaire is gonna very carefully and gingerly pick up the acorn, and walk home. [exhales]
Rhi: Okay…
Minna: [sad whimper]
Rhi: How about I mix things up? I’m not gonna go in exact order. Let’s do Myra next.
Minna: So, I think it’s some time later when things have calmed down. Myra comes to Phin when they’re at The Nest.
Minna (as Myra): Hey, I wanted to thank you for earlier. You really stepped up for me.
Madge (as Phin): Well, tch, yeah, of course I would. You’re the closest friend I have…
Minna (as Myra): It meant a lot.
Madge (as Phin): …and she was a jerk.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. I guess, I just wanted to let you know that it means a lot to me that I have somebody like you.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I’m glad that I can be there for you. Seriously, if you ever need me to beat up anyone else, just ask.
Minna (as Myra): [giggles] I have to tell you, I haven’t had to deal with her in quite a while.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, I figured, if she didn’t know.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Madge (as Phin): You don’t really talk about that group very much.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah- Most of the time I’d rather not. Um, it wasn’t a great situation, I got out of it, and met you guys.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. If you ever wanna, you know, dig into that, I’m here to listen… and punch faces if necessary.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] I guess it doesn’t feel like there’s a lot to talk about. I mean, there’s a lot in the past, but I’d rather it didn’t matter now. You know?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Yeah, totally.
Minna (as Myra): [deep breath] I’ve got something new going, and it’s better.
Madge (as Phin): Muy better.
Minna: These two idiots. They’re so bad about talking about their feelings. I could just hear the palpable awkwardness in both of their voices. It’s great.
[laughter]
Madge: But at the end of it, I think, Phin will be like:
Madge (as Phin): I know that you want it to stay in the past, and I totally respect that, but I want you to know… I’m glad I have you on my team, and I’m glad that we took that job together, because my life is way more interesting with you in it.
Minna (as Myra): Me too. … Do you want breakfast? [laughs]
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: Yay, friendship.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: Let’s then go to Minx. Do you want to do picking up your art?
Josie: Yeah, sure. Let’s just do that.
Rhi: I think it’s just, there’s a storefront somewhere else in Crow’s Foot where you’re supposed to report to pick up your thing. Tell me how this goes, how you approach the situation, knowing that there’s a chance that you’re gonna get recognized going in here.
Josie: I think she’s gonna wear an outfit that usually isn’t like her, not something too painful to wear but something that’s just not her color. I don’t know. She’s just gonna slightly put them off so they’ll have to like ask if she was there and not just be like ‘hey you were there.’
Rhi: Yeah. You head into this shop. I think it’s just kind of like a general house goods type store. There are utensils, plates, bowls, and towels and stuff like that. The directions that are part of the invitation tell you where to go to collect your winnings. There’s a counter sort of off to the side where there’s a very bored looking young man just kind of staring off into space who doesn’t quite seem to notice you when you step up in front of him.
Josie (as Minx): [clears throat]
Rhi (as Young Man): Oh. Um- Sorry. Sorry. What can I do for you?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I’m picking up a delivery.
Rhi (as Young Man): Oh. A delivery? Or were you here for the, um…
Josie (as Minx): I was here the other night.
Rhi (as Young Man): Ah. Yes. Do you have your card?
Josie (as Minx): I do.
Josie: I hand it to him.
Rhi: He looks at it and flips through a ledger. He spins the ledger around to face you and says:
Rhi (as Young Man): Sign here. Let me go get it.
Rhi: And he disappears into the back. You can see, because he’s just sort of left you alone with this ledger, a lot of other people have already picked their stuff up. You can see that there has been a signature put down for the map.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: So, Tesslyn has picked that up.
Josie: Well, I’ll sign just some bullshit fake signature, but can I like, in a small pocketbook or something, scribble down as best I can a copy of that signature?
Rhi: Oh yeah. Sure. I’ll let you do that.
Josie: Yeah. I’m not trying to get a super accurate forgery, I just want to remember it.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. So yeah, as you finish doing that he comes back with a small wooden box.
Rhi (as Young Man): Okay. Let me check the number… Yup. That all matches.
Rhi: He tells you how much you owe, you pay that amount, and then he hands you the wooden box.
Rhi (as Young Man): Have a- Have a good day.
Josie (as Minx): A-All right. Thank you, dear.
Josie: I’ll kind of pause at the door awkwardly, thinking to myself, well that surely went smoothly. [laughs] I head back to The Nest with a bit of a spring in my step.
Rhi: Yep, and a brand new painting. I feel like the walls are getting pretty covered with art.
Josie: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: It’s getting a little crowded. Minx is gonna have to start rotating them.
Josie: Also… Where’s Kevin?
Rhi: I don’t know. Where is Kevin? I think last we heard Kevin was keeping Blaire company at her bedside while she was recovering from a broken leg, but I am certain he has moved since then.
Josie: I think Kevin is by Minx’s door with a fashionable sunhat on, even though sunhats aren’t really a thing, but you know, fashion.
Rhi: Yeah, just a broad brimmed hat.
Josie: Yes. [laughs]
Rhi: Very good. We’ll go to you all making the delivery of the uniforms. How do you think you guys get there?
Josie: I presume the way we did the first time.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Just carrying this giant box.
Josie: Well, I mean, we might be able to pack it into smaller boxes or something.
Madge: Yeah, four smaller boxes, I think.
Rhi: Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. When you guys are doing that repacking it is indeed four sets of complete Spirit Warden uniforms with the masks, head concealing hoods, gloves, the coats, everything. A couple of you notice as you’re packing these away there’s a couple blood stains. They’re fairly small, don’t really show up that much on the dark blue fabric, but they’re there.
Josie: Hmm… Okay.
Rhi: But yeah, you get them packed up, boxed up, and head up to The Mustang. This time you come in carrying a bunch of packages, and the woman behind the desk sees you, and her eyes widen a little bit.
Rhi (as Woman): Uh- Head on into the bar and have a seat. I’ll get Tuhan for you.
Rhi: So, after a couple minutes Tuhan comes back in and sort of looks at the boxes piled up on the table.
Rhi (as Tuhan): I’ll be damned. I’ll be honest, not 100% sure that you were actually gonna pull this off, but very glad to be wrong.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, we live to surprise.
Rhi: She opens up one of the boxes.
Rhi (as Tuhan): [whistles] Wow. All right. Yeah. These are gonna come in very handy.
Rhi: She closes the box again and sort of pats the lid.
Rhi (as Tuhan): All right. We’ll need a couple days to get things ready on our side. Have any of you ever been out to The Deathlands?
Kim (as Blaire): I have.
Rhi (as Tuhan): All right. Well, so you can probably help them out a bit then, but make sure you’ve got weapons, ammo, light sources, anything that you have to ward off or combat spirits. We are not responsible for your safety over there. That’s all on you. If you come back we’ll get you out, but we’re not gonna make sure you come back. I just wanna be clear about that.
Minna (as Myra): That’s completely fair.
Rhi (as Tuhan): All right. Well then…
Rhi: She gestures over for somebody else to come and collect the boxes, and she kind of scoops one up under her arm.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Come back here in two days, and we’ll get ready for a trip.

Download a Word doc version of the transcript: TM015 The Haunted Estate Score
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall, and thank you for joining us once again. If you’ve already left us a review on iTunes, thank you so very much, and if you haven’t, please consider leaving one, or tell your friends about the show. We really want to keep expanding, and new listeners are the most important part of that.
A few announcements: First, it is officially International Podcast Month. Tess of RPG Casts and I Am Here has organized a huge, month-long podcast extravaganza. Head over to InternationalPodcastMonth.com to see the episodes and reviews that have already been posted. You can hear me as a player in legends of Hyrule, a Legend of Zelda inspired RPG designed by Nora Blake on September 8, and Minna is in a Harry Potter themed game of Fiasco on September 12.
Also, I will be at AcadeCon this year. It’s a board and tabletop game con in Dayton, Ohio that runs from November 9 to 11. If you’re going to be there let me know. Just as with GenCon I’d love to meet some fans and hand out more bookmarks.
One note about today’s episode: I do need to give a content warning for violence against animals. The animals in question are feral dogs, and the violence isn’t too explicit, but if you want to skip over it, timestamps are in the show notes [and marked in the transcript].
Next, Minna is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Minna: According to the True Colors Fund, as many as 1.6 million youth experience homelessness every year, and up to 40% of that number are LGBT+. In Pinellas County, Florida, family resources and local stakeholders and community partners gather to talk and develop a strategic plan to address this problem locally. Safe Connections Resource Center is part of their strategic plan to provide homeless youth with a central point of access for needed services that are imperative to their safety and survival including basic needs assessment, counseling, and referrals.
Family Resources is raising money to renovate a building and open the resource center which is meant for LGBT+ youth and young adults up to the age of 24. If you would like to help make Safe Connections possible, go to www.giveakidahome.org to make a donation.
Rhi: If you’re able, please consider donating a few dollars.
Also, please take some time to visit 5calls.org and call your representatives. There are a lot of legislative threats being put forward by the GOP in the run-up to the midterm elections, and we need to push back against them everywhere we can. And as always, please check to make sure that you’re registered to vote. There have already been reports of outside interference in elections and the republican party has continued to engage in voter suppression efforts. It is critical that we turn out and vote in such overwhelming numbers that suppression and interference can’t change the results.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:54]
Rhi: We’re at the edge of The River Dosk. It is pretty late at night, the moon has set, but it’s a couple hours before the shattered remains of the sun will rise. You are almost about as far south in the city as you can get without actually leaving it, sort of the opposite end of the river from where The Lost District is, which seemed a little confusing when The Silver Nails told you that’s where you were to meet them, but lacking better options that’s where you headed.
You make your way there with all of your gear and head to the dock that they told you about, and sure enough there is sort of in an overhang on the river, largely shielded from street view, there is a large ferry that already holds a number of people and about five horses. It’s pretty quiet. It’s the sort of tension in the air that you get before a big heist, just everyone is very focused, kind of on edge.
Tuhan, the member of The Silver Nails who you met previously who gave you the job to steal the Spirit Warden uniforms from The Hive’s auction, spots the four of you and comes over and sort of looks you all over and gives a nod.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Ugh. I was starting to wonder if you’d actually come.
Josie (as Minx): We’re never late.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Oh, it wasn’t lateness so much I was worried about as you seeing sense and not doing this, but you’re here, so… we’ll be on our way. While you’re traveling with us you need to do what we say, when we say it, without question. Once you’re out on your own you handle things however you want, but I am not going to let any of my people get killed because some of you get curious, or scared, or whatever. We clear?
Josie & Madge (as Minx & Phin): Crystal.
Kim (as Blaire): Ooh… Jinx.
[giggling]
Rhi (as Tuhan): All right. Then, let’s get going.
Rhi: A couple of the other Silver Nails help you all onto the ferry, they untie the ropes and set off, sort of heading as silently as possible across the river. There are no lights on the ferry, and aside from the crackling of the lightning wall ahead of you getting closer as you move across the river, it’s very dark. As you look north kind of up in the direction of where The Lost District would be you can see, silhouetted against the lightning barrier, a couple of towers that have some lights in them that you’re guessing are the Spirit Warden outposts.
You make it across the river without incident. The Silver Nails jump off, tie off the ferry on this side, lead their horses off. There’s five Silver Nails who have accompanied you. Tuhan does not do this, but the other four each hold out a hand to pull you up onto the horse behind them, so each of you is riding behind someone… which is probably a very new experience for all of you. I’m betting that none of you have ever been on horseback before.
Madge: Truuue.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Horses are not super common in the city, so this is a bit of a new experience for everyone.
Josie: Minx is visibly uncomfortable the whole time.
Rhi: Aw.
Kim (as Blaire): Do they have names?
Rhi: The woman that you’re riding with says:
Rhi (as Woman): Oh, yeah. This is Ima.
Rhi: And she pats the horse’s neck.
Kim (as Blaire): Ima~
Rhi (as Woman): And I’m Zuri.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi! Blaire.
Rhi (as Zuri): Nice to meet you. Hold on tight.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay!
Rhi: So, where you all step off the ferry, there’s about a good 30 or 40 feet between the river bank and the lightning barrier, so you’re not right up against it but it’s also not a huge amount of space. Tuhan rides her horse up closer to the lightning barrier, hops off, pulls something out of her bag, and does something to the lightning barrier, sticks something into the ground, and the barrier kind of sparks a bit and then an opening appears a couple feet off the ground.
She hops back on her horse, kind of wheels around, pulls back pretty far, like almost right up to the edge of the river where the rest of you are, and then the horse breaks into a gallop, and all of the horses move to follow and as they get up to that larger gap they all leap through.
Josie: That’s metal as shit.
Rhi: So, you all pass through the lightning barrier and land in The Deathlands. I think Blaire is probably the only person who has been in The Deathlands. Phin has been outside the lightning barrier, but it’s on The Void Sea which is a rather different experience.
Madge: Yeah. It’s a whole different beast.
Rhi: Yeah. So, the horses all get through the lightning barrier and you all start riding pretty quickly back north. You’re staying fairly close to the barrier, but if you look out further into The Deathlands it is extremely dark, and it’s not totally quiet where you are. There’s the crackling of the lightning barrier, there’s the horses’ hooves pounding along the ground, but otherwise there’s not the usual background noise of the city that you’re all very accustomed to. You can see sort of in the distance there’s some hills along the horizon, and occasionally you see off in the distance, just barely visible at the edge of the light from the barrier, faint movement. You’re not sure what it is. The Silver Nails are not slowing down long enough to let anybody have a good look.
You ride north back towards The Lost District for a while, and as you get closer you start to see the shapes of buildings, rubble, you can actually see sort of towering above everything the remains of deactivated, broken lightning towers. You get into The Lost District itself. It’s weird riding on the horses through these streets, because it’s in a way as if you just sort of were in Brightstone from a couple centuries ago, but a lot of the styles are even older than that. At one point the quiet is broken by this piercing shriek from somewhere, you can’t really pinpoint where it is. It echoes, and then is gone.
Josie: Minx lets out a small yelp.
Rhi: [laughs] I think the Silver Nail that you’re riding with kind of shakes her head a little.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: A couple of the riders do react, like they sort of look in the direction of it, but none of them make to go towards it.
Josie: Probably smart.
Rhi: After riding through the streets for a few minutes you reach a slightly more intact building. It looks like it might have been a bank, or maybe a storefront, it’s a large stone building. The second floor is partially collapsed, but the first floor is pretty solidly built still, and there’s light inside. It looks like there’s some lanterns and some flame burning. As you ride up, a couple people come out from inside the building. Again, they’re Severosi, they have the Silver Nail rings on, and one of them, a person in leather armor with a spear strapped across their back, hair pulled back in a ponytail, walks up to Tuhan almost before she stopped her horse entirely, and just goes:
Rhi (as Person): What took you so long?! And who are- Who are these people?!
Rhi: Tuhan brings her horse to a stop.
Rhi (as Tuhan): We had some other affairs to take care of in the city. These are, uh, some guests. We’re not going to be responsible for them for much longer. Don’t worry.
Rhi: The other person kind of scowls and gives you all a hard look as you’re helped down from the horses, because I imagine none of you know how to properly dismount. [laughs]
Madge: [laughs] Yeah. Fair assumption.
Josie: I forget if we’ve dropped that we’re The magpies to them.
Rhi: No.
Madge: We haven’t. We’ve kept it to ourselves.
Josie: No? Okay.
Rhi: Tuhan turns to all of you and says:
Rhi (as Tuhan): This is Sazari. They’re the leader of our encampment here.
Josie (as Minx): A pleasure.
Rhi: Sazari just kind of gives you a very curt nod, then looks at Tuhan.
Rhi (as Sazari): What, we’re bringing in tourists now?
Rhi: Tuhan shakes her head and takes Sazari’s arm and leads them off a little ways, and they start having a quiet conversation. The woman who was riding with Blaire, Zuri, starts taking the horses reins and leading them into the building, and you can hear some voices raised from inside as greetings are exchanged.
After a few moments, Sazari kind of shakes their head and also heads off inside, and Tuhan comes back over.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Well, we got you in as agreed. If you come back here they should get you back out again, if you get back.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you for the escort, and I’m glad there is a post to return to. I was expecting our exit to be more frantic.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Well, it still could be. Sazari tells me that they’ve lost two people recently from lifeseeker crows, so keep an eye on the skies.
Minna (as Myra): Lifeseeker crows?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, hold on a sec. [laughs] That doesn’t sound good.
Rhi: Blaire, you would actually know what these are. In Duskwall, The Spirit Wardens have deathseeker crows, and they are basically magic arcane crows that whenever someone dies in the city they fly out and find the body.
Kim: Sick.
Rhi: Nobody’s really sure which came first, the deathseeker crows that you see in the city or the lifeseeker crows that you find in The Deathlands. Lifeseeker crows only live out in The Deathlands. They’ve got a wingspan on average of about 12 feet.
Kim: Nice.
Minna: [yelps]
Rhi: And they are drawn to life essence. Similar to spirits, they seek out living beings and want to drain their essence in order to survive. Blaire, you’ve probably had a couple close calls with them in your expeditions.
Kim (as Blaire): Pretty babies.
Josie (as Minx): Is there anything out here that isn’t absolutely terrifying? Anything at all?
Rhi: Tuhan just looks at you for a second.
Rhi (as Tuhan): … No.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Well, thank you for the blunt answer on that. I’m gonna go be over here for a moment.
Kim: Blaire is visibly holding back her tongue, because all of this is false!
[laughter]
Rhi: So, Tuhan kind of looks you all over.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Well, I have some things to take care of here, so… good luck.
Rhi: [laughs] And she turns to head inside.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I think Myra and Blaire are the ones with the expertise for what we’re looking for, so lead on.
Minna (as Myra): I have never been out into The Deathlands. We might be reliant on Blaire to some extent.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay!
Minna (as Myra): You’ve been out here, right?
Kim (as Blaire): yeah! But like, yeah, I’ve been outside. I haven’t been to this side of the outside, but I have been outside. I’ve left The Nest.
[giggling]
Josie (as Minx): Well, I should hope so, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): But yeah, also, I’ve passed the lightning barrier like a million times.
Josie (as Minx): Right. So, does anyone have any idea where to begin looking for this thing?
Rhi: So, Avrathi’s notes had a small map sketched in with the location of the estate that they believe the blood-iron ring is at, and it is actually kind of just pretty much due north of where you are. It’s along the river. You have an idea of where you need to go.
Josie: All right. Well, I suppose we should start there.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So you guys are gonna set off?
Multiple: Yeah.
Rhi: All right.
Josie: And did the notes provide a description of the look of the ring, or are we simply looking for…
Minna: Yes. The ring is sort of an iron ring. It has a pitted surface, like lots of little pockmarks on it. When it’s soaked in blood it becomes smooth until the effects ware off, but we’re looking for a pitted ring, basically.
Josie: All right. We really are starting with a needle in a haystack here, but at least we know where the haystack is.
Minna: Well, we can make some guesses where it might be given its precious nature.
Josie: Perhaps.
Madge: Mm-hmm. It’s not like someone will just ditch a ring that powerful.
Rhi: You head off into the streets, moving away from the Silver Nails base, and without the other people who you’d been riding with and the sound of horse hooves it is really quiet. This is probably the quietest that you’ve ever experienced, all of you kind of growing up in cities. Duskwall especially is a very crowded, cramped city. There are always people, there is always noise, and out here it is quiet enough that you can hear each other breathing.
Josie: Speaking of, Minx’s breathing is kind of hitched. [laughs]
Minna: [concerned moan]
Josie: Minx is just kind of visibly terrified the whole way.
Rhi: You get about half way to the estate, and most of what you’ve seen is empty, ruined buildings. You pass through the ruins of some kind of grand plaza. There was a crumbled fountain in the middle, some sculptures that had collapsed and fallen into rubble, it was clearly some place once very beautiful.
## Content Warning: animal violence, animal death [0:16:57] To skip, go to the next timestamp.
Past the plaza, a few more streets up, you all hear, quite clearly behind you, not footsteps… it’s clearly not the sound of another person walking, it’s soft padding with a little bit of a faint click on the stones as if something with claws were walking. You turn to see scattered among the fallen stones and pillars crouched down low is a pack of about five or six, you can’t tell if they’re feral dogs or if they’re wolves or if they’re a mix of the two, but they are clearly following you and are just as clearly being led by the hound at the front of the pack that isn’t sort of slinking along trying to be stealthy, it is standing there staring at you with its eyes glowing blue.
Minna: [hums nervously]
Josie: But it’s not openly hostile yet?
Rhi: Well, since you rolled a desperate on the engagement roll…
Josie: Ah. [laughs]
Rhi: As you all turn around, the lead dog lets out a howl and all of them move in to attack.
Josie (as Minx): [yelps]
Kim (as Blaire): Puppies!
Minna (as Myra): Um?!
[laughter]
Josie: I have a sword? I’m just gonna kind of cut wildly at it if it gets close, whatever gets close, just frantically trying to stab at them.
Minna: Uh, yeah, let’s try and shoot one before it gets us.
Madge: Shooty-shoot-shoot.
Kim: I’ll shoot too.
Rhi: So, everybody draws pistols, except Minx. Minna, you were the one who said you wanted to do a shoot first, so you get to start off. This is desperate, so when you make this roll you’ll mark experience, and are you shooting at a regular dog or are you shooting at a spooky glowing dog? There’s only one spooky glowing dog, but…
Minna: I think whichever one looks like it’s most likely to be coming at me, frankly. I think she only has a second to-
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. That will just be one of the regular dogs then.
Minna: Can I push myself?
Rhi: You sure can.
Minna: I’m gonna do that.
Rhi: It’s 2 stress.
Minna: Yeah. These are some good dice. I got a 6!
Kim & Josie: Woo!
Rhi: Tell us how that looks with one of these wolf-dog things charging at you. You take it out. It does not attack you. You just stop it.
Minna: Okay. I think what that looks like is she sees them closing in and she just has a moment of clarity when the adrenaline kicks in, and she whips out a pistol and just shoots.
Rhi: Okay. next we’ll have Phin go. I think that first shot, the dogs hesitated a little bit, so you gained just like an extra second of time. I think for you it’s going to be risky, and probably for Blaire as well.
Madge: Yeah. I’ll go for the glow-eyed dog.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Yeah. I’m gonna push myself to give myself another die. That’s a 6.
Rhi: Okay! You hit it square on, and it staggers back, and its mouth moves like it should be yelping but it doesn’t make any sound, and it doesn’t fall the way you would expect it to.
Madge: Hmm. [curiously] Okay…?
Rhi: It is still up, but it staggered back. It’s also not bleeding, really. It looks like it’s damaged, but there’s no blood.
Josie: Is this a vampire dog?
Rhi: [muffled stage whisper] It might be.
Josie: [nervously] Uh…
Minna: [hums nervously]
Madge: It’s definitely not a real dog.
Kim: It’s definitely a good dog.
Madge: No?
[laughter]
Kim: It’s a good boy!
Josie: I feel like this is the definition of a bad dog.
Kim: Good. Boy.
Rhi: Blaire, what are you shooting at, regular dog or spooky dog?
Kim: I’m gonna shoot the spoopy dog. Ha, 1.
Rhi: Okay. So, you take a shot at the spooky dog, but you hesitate a little bit, because you’ve never seen this before.
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: You’ve only seen ghosts that like, possess people?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: This is weird! And new! And different! And oh man, you really don’t wanna shoot it!
Kim: It’s so cool! [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: By the time you shoot it’s moved from where you aimed, and it slams into you, knocks you flat on your back. You are in a desperate position, basically. It’s just got you pinned down.
Kim: Ruh-roh.
Rhi: And, you do however get a very close look at this dog. It’s pinning you down but it’s not breathing, it’s not doing the dog panting thing or anything, it’s just got you pinned and it’s silent, and there’s no blood coming from the wound on its shoulder, and you can see some other wounds that you’re guessing are maybe older that are also just kind of like, they’re not bleeding but they also haven’t healed, they’re just kind of on its body.
Kim: Weird.
Rhi: That’s got you pinned down. Now Minx, the spooky dog that has Blaire pinned is within stabbing range.
Josie: Yeah. I mean, I’m not thinking super clear anyway, so I think I’m gonna go for the stabbing of it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Minx just is clearly not thinking as smart-ways as the rest of y’all, because she pulls out a sword and then starts stabbing at it, like:
Josie (as Minx): Back! Bac, rancid curr!
Josie: Ah-ha, I got two 2s.
Rhi: Okay… You take a swing at spooky wolf-dog, and you just miss. You just don’t hit it at all. that means you aren’t paying attention to the regular dog that charges in and bites down on your leg.
Kim & Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: That’s gonna be level 2 harm, Dog Bite.
Josie: Oh geez.
Rhi: You can resist it, or as mentioned earlier you can use armor. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah, you know what, I think I am gonna use armor about it.
Rhi: Okay. I’m gonna say for this that the armor is just gonna negate it, like the dog just clamps down on the armor. It hurts a little, but it doesn’t do any lasting damage and you’re kind of able to kick it off.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: On your load, mark down that you’ve used the armor.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay! So, current situation: There is a spooky dog pinning Blaire down, four regular dogs still up, one of which just bit Minx. The dogs have kind of, now that Minx sort of kicked the one back, they’re not actively charging anymore. They’re kind of into that circling thing where they’re looking for an opening. So yeah, who wants to do what?
Minna: Uh, worried about Blaire, so:
Minna (as Myra): Blaire! Do you know if there’s anything we can do with this thing?
Kim (as Blaire): I have no earthly idea.
Josie (as Minx): Do you have an unearthly idea?
Kim (as Blaire): Unfortunately, this time no. I know I usually do, but I have never seen these things before.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: I think I’m going to Attune to the ghost field.
Kim: Oh, interesting.
Rhi: Okay. Are you just trying to look into the ghost field, or are you wanting to do something by attuning?
Minna: I think it’s more of kind of a gathering information on this.
Rhi: Okay. You look into the ghost field. The four regular dogs have sort of ghost field signatures similar to that of humans and other living beings. The dog that has Blaire pinned down, it’s glowing very bright, but it looks stretched out and thin, kind of gaunt or starved. You can tell, it’s bright enough in the ghost field, that this is not a living being, this is a ghost or something else.
Minna: So, I don’t think that attacking it physically is going to do anything.
Rhi: Well, like, when Phin shot it, it reacted, and it’s favoring that leg now.
Minna: You either banish the spirit or you destroy the body so utterly that it can’t do anything.
Josie: So what you’re saying is hit it really, really hard. Can an unusual weapon be something like, I don’t know, a flashbang or firecrackers or something?
Rhi: So like, grenades are I think something that have to be custom built at this point, they’re not super regularly available.
Josie: I could do a flashback about it.
Rhi: Sure. I mean, and you guys do have Seeks who is a creator of such things.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yes. If you would like to do a flashback, I’ll say that’s gonna be a 1 stress flashback, and you can acquire I’ll say a flashbang grenade.
Josie: Sweet. Awesome. Yeah, I just wanna throw that into the middle of the other dogs and hopefully they bug out.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Go ahead and make a roll for that.
Josie: Okay. Karma’s coming back to bite me. That’s double 1s. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. Um…
Josie: Makes sense. Minx is still freaking out and shit.
Rhi: I think you just don’t know how to use it properly.
Josie: [laughs] Uh-huh.
Rhi: Like, Seeks was explaining it, but was explaining it very quickly and got distracted by other stuff so you didn’t quite process it, so you like just take it out and throw it and don’t pull a pin or anything, and it just kind of goes [metal settling on the ground “tink” and “thunk” noises].
[laughter]
It lands in the midst of them and they just kind of like look at it, and then look back at you.
Josie: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Apparently these are harder than they look.
Madge: I have demolition tools.
Rhi: Uh-huh.
Madge: Sooo, I could do that.
Rhi: I will remind you, it is currently on top of Blaire.
Madge: Yeah. Oh gosh, yeah. Um…
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: You could wrestle it off of Blaire and then demo it. [laughs]
Madge: Yeah, I’ll do that. I’ll tackle the dog. That’s a 6.
Rhi: You just rush over and tackle the wolf-dog off of Blaire.
Madge: I want to be rolling with it with a stick of dynamite in my hand…
Rhi: Okay!
Madge: …and then like stick the dynamite in its mouth and light it.
Kim: Holy shit.
Rhi: Yes! I am 100% onboard with this. Absolutely.
Madge: [giggles]
Rhi: You’re gonna need to make another roll.
Madge: I’m gonna do Wreck for that one.
Rhi: Mm-hmm! Yep, that is definitely Wreck.
Madge: Two 5s and a 6.
Rhi: Okay, a 6. Yes. So, tell us how this looks, because you succeed.
Madge: So, how it works is, as I’m doing a roll with the dog I’m trying to stick the dynamite in its mouth, and I strike a match on the cobblestones or whatever, and I light the stick, finish shoving it in the dog’s mouth, and scramble away really quick. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. The dog kind of whips its head around a little bit, and then there’s an explosion, and then there’s not a dog anymore.
Madge: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: And the rest of the dogs just book it.
Madge: I feel bad, but—
[giggling]
Rhi: I mean, it was not gonna do good things to Blaire.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: The sound of the explosion sort of echoes a little bit, and then you hear the dogs running off, and then that quiet returns as the four of you are standing / lying in the street.
## End Content Warning [0:28:24]
Josie: I was expecting vicious creatures and ghosts in succession, but lucky us, we got them both at the same time. Heh.
Madge: Yeah. Why would anything be easy for us?
Josie (as Minx): You know, I suppose that’s a good question.
Rhi: So, you all continue on towards the Narathi estate, and it remains pretty quiet as you are making your way up there. You go past another large manor house, and something in front of this one, it’s not the Narathi estate, it’s not where you’re heading, but there’s something on the ground in front of this estate that kind of catches everybody’s eye. It looks like a body, like remains, and it’s in the, you know, to you all, pretty old fashioned plague doctor uniform. It’s face-down on the ground, one arm still kind of outstretched and clutching a bag, looks like probably a doctor’s bag, and if anybody gets a little closer they can see that there is still a rusted dagger embedded in its back.
Kim: Ooh.
Josie: Hmm.
Minna: Wait, are they facing towards the door or out of the door?
Rhi: Away, it looked like they were coming back out of the manor and fell.
Josie (as Minx): Well, given how old the dagger is, at least hopefully the person who placed it there isn’t here anymore.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. My guess would be that this happened at the time of the plague, which would be 200-some years ago?
Kim (as Blaire): It’s incredibly well-preserved if it’s that old.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I’m not touching it.
Rhi: Am I safe to assume that Blaire has gone over to poke at it a bit?
Kim: Oh yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So Blaire, like, it’s a skeleton. So, yeah, that’s just a thing that’s there.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that is somewhat distressing. I don’t know why anyone would attack a doctor. What’s in his bag?
Rhi: You gonna take a look, Blaire?
Kim: Um, sure.
Rhi: Blaire, inside the bag is dust, some shards of broken glass, and a couple of like palm-sized stones that are pretty smooth that have a bunch of runes engraved on them.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: They’re not runes that you’re familiar with at all. there’s two stones like that.
Kim: All right, well I’m gonna hang onto the stones.
Madge: That’s a good idea, maybe.
Kim: I’m gonna take both of them.
Rhi: Okay. You guys gonna continue on?
Madge: Yep.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: It’s just another few streets after the plague doctor that you reach your destination. The Narathi estate like most of the buildings in The Lost District is a bit crumbled, it’s not fallen completely into ruin, and you can kind of see the remains of the grandeur that it once had. It’s a three story building, kind of sprawling, large windows most of which are broken, the front door is a set of double doors one of which is kind of half fallen off the hinges and sort of hanging inside. It does back up to the river, basically, so this is actually reasonably well-illuminated because you’re within a couple hundred feet of the lightning barrier. You guys gonna head inside, or do you wanna look around the outside at all?
Madge: Yeah, let’s head in.
Kim: Heading in, yep.
Rhi: Okay. you step into the front hall, and it was clearly once a very beautiful place. There’s marble floors, a grand staircase towards the back, doors and archways leading off further into the house, and Minx, this catches your eye immediately. There are paintings on the walls, quite a number of them. There’s probably like five or six just in this front room.
Josie: Ooh. What are they of?
Rhi: It’s kind of interesting, looking at them. some of them are landscapes of the city or The Void Sea, there’s a number that seem like they were probably painted from the back of the house like of the river.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Some of them are portraits. You have been getting into art more, learning more about it, different styles and things, and these are all made by someone with a lot of technical skill, but they don’t seem to have a lot of personality to them.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I shall have to decide on my way out, I think. They’re not particularly great, but they might have value by simply coming from this area.
Josie: Minx for the first time is kind of relaxing a little bit, and clearly distracted by the paintings. [laughs]
Rhi: You’ve got several doors leading off of this room and the stairs heading up. Where do you guys wanna start?
Josie: I wanna look through doors on this floor and see if there’s a parlor or anything.
Madge: I’m gonna head upstairs.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: [sarcastically] Let’s split up. We’ll cover more ground that way.
Rhi: [holding laughter] I was just about to ask: Are you guys all just gonna walk into this spooky house and immediately split up?
Kim: Yeah. We’re gonna Scooby Doo this shit.
Josie: Yeah, I mean, it’s tradition.
Rhi: All right. So, Minx, you’re gonna go look for a parlor, Phin, you’re heading upstairs. Blaire and Myra, what are you two up to?
Minna: So, my thought is that probably this ring would be wherever the master of the house is, so I’m going to go looking for him and probably start with like where I would think the bedrooms are.
Rhi: Okay. you would imagine that’s probably up on the second or third floor, so you and Phin might be heading in a similar direction to start.
Minna: Sure, sounds good.
Rhi: And Blaire, where are you going?
Kim: I think I might follow Myra if that’s okay.
Minna: Sounds good to me.
Rhi: [laughing] Three of you are heading upstairs and leaving Minx alone on the ground floor.
Josie: [laughing] Okay. Minx got distracted and now she’s alone. Perfect.
Rhi: All right. We’ll start on the ground floor then. We’ll start with Minx. You said you’re looking for a parlor?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: You’re able to find what you’re guessing is the parlor, it’s kind of towards the front of the house, big windows, some sort of ruined couches and things, more art hanging on the walls. Yeah. Are you looking for anything in particular in here?
Josie: A, any small valuable items, and B, I’m very specifically looking for like secret compartments or levers or the like, like how we broke into that one guy’s house and they had a secret lab, I want to look for more stuff like that.
Rhi: Ah~ Yes. That makes sense. I am gonna say, I mean, yeah, however you wanna do that. It’s probably going to be either Survey or Study.
Josie: I can do a Survey.
Rhi: Hmm. This is gonna be controlled for the moment. There’s not really any immediate threats.
Josie: Six.
Rhi: Six, okay. So, you find both things you were looking for. You’re sort of poking around, and there’s a side table that has a tarnished silver tea set on it, and you pick that up like ‘eh, I could polish this off and probably get a little money for it,’ and then as you set one of the tea cups back down on wood inlay on the top of the sideboard there’s a click.
Josie (as Minx): Huh.
Rhi: You sort of lean down and find a secret compartment that has a small pouch of money in there, of coin, at a quick glance it looks like it’s about 2 coin worth, and a very finely made dagger with some jewels set into the hilt that’s probably worth another couple coin.
Josie: Ooh. Sweet.
Rhi: Okay. so yeah, you find those and you’re feeling pretty pleased with yourself, and then you realize it’s gotten really quiet down here.
Josie (as Minx): Well dears, I do think we’ll at least make out well on this score for once. … Dears? Hello?
Rhi: [grinning] So, I think on that note we’ll cut upstairs. I think the three of you have headed up. Myra and Blaire, you were going to try to find a master bedroom or something?
Kim: yeah.
Rhi: Yeah? Phin, what were you looking for upstairs?
Madge: I’m looking for a study.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, I think you end up sort of splitting. Phin, you go off, Myra and Blaire, you head in another direction. We’ll follow Phin for the moment. You are able to find a nice study with a lot of, again, sort of similar to the parlor downstairs, a lot of the furniture has fallen into ruin and disrepair, the shelves are full of moldy, rotted books, there’s a very large impressive desk at one end of the room. There are no paintings in here, interestingly.
Madge: I’m gonna start with the desk, and I’m gonna start looking also for secret hatches and the like.
Rhi: Okay. this will also be controlled for you.
Madge: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Ooh. Hmm.
Madge: The floor could be worn down and weak underneath the desk.
Rhi: Oh! Yeah! Yeah. The floorboards under the desk are kind of rotted and weak, and they are gonna start to give way under you while you’re searching.
Madge: Okay. that’s a 3. [into hands] Hubris!
Rhi: So, this was controlled, so what happens is you start opening drawers and sort of feeling around, and you move the chair out to the side and step in, and the floorboards kind of splinter under your foot. You know that it’s like okay, I could either risk it and keep searching and hope I find something, or I can back off and hopefully not cause this to completely collapse.
Madge: What if I step back from this desk and throw a mound of moldy books on it to purposefully send it through the floor to break it open.
Rhi: … Yeah. [laughs]
Madge: Cool.
Rhi: Yes. I will allow that.
Madge: That gets me three dice, because I’m looking to Wreck this thing. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Madge: [whines]
Rhi: What did you get?
Madge: My highest is a 3.
Rhi: You start throwing books, and the books just don’t seem to have enough wait. That seems to be the problem, that they’re just falling to dust as you throw them.
Madge: [grunts angrily]
Rhi: So…
Madge: Yeah. What I’m gonna do [laughing] is I’m gonna run over Loony Toons style and try stomping on the weak floorboard right at the edge of it.
Rhi: [laughing] Okay. yeah. Go ahead, and you can roll Wreck again, but I think this is gonna be risky now, because you’re now facing the possibility that you could fall down with the desk.
Madge: I know. I know~ [laughs] I got another 3.
Rhi: Oh no! All right. Welp, we knew what was gonna happen here. So yeah, you go over and you jump up and down on the boards and it’s not doing anything, so you jump up and down harder and it’s still not doing anything, so you jump up really hard and come down with both heels and it cracks and splinters, and… I think we cut to Minx who is tentatively creeping back out into the hall. You just hear this cacophony as a desk and Phin and a lot of floorboards come crashing down.
Josie (as Minx): [shrieks]
[laughter]
Josie: I think Minx is gonna throw herself back into the wall in abject terror.
Rhi: So Phin, that is gonna be, as you are kind of sprawled in this mess of broken wood, I think you’re gonna take level 2 harm.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: You can resist or you can burn armor.
Madge: I’ll burn my armor for that
Rhi: Okay. You’re just kind of lying there in the heap of desk.
Madge (as Phin): [coughs] I feel like my ears are ringing just a little bit.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] So, Blaire and Myra, let’s cut up to you real quick. I think you two are still kind of searching the halls looking for the master bedroom, and you haven’t found it on this floor yet, and you’re kind of heading back towards the stairs to see maybe if you need to go up to the third floor, and then you hear loud crashing sounds, a distant scream, all coming from the ground floor.
Kim (as Blaire): That doesn’t sound good.
Minna (as Myra): No, it doesn’t. do you think that was Phin?
Kim (as Blaire): Honestly, I do. We should check it out.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah… Yeah, let’s go do that.
Rhi: You two head back downstairs. I think they come across Minx still plastered to the wall, eyes wide with terror first.
Josie (as Minx): [exasperated breathing] Ah… gods…
Madge (as Phin): Ugh…
Josie (as Minx): Phin…
Minna (as Myra): Are you all right?
Madge (as Phin): [weakly] Ugh… I fell through the floorboards with a desk, so I’ve been better.
Minna (as Myra): yeah, that’s not great. Do you want a hand up?
Kim (as Blaire): Why did you do that?
Madge (as Phin): Um, so, let’s just- I didn’t do it on purpose. I was walking towards the desk and the floor just gave out under me, completely unprompted.
Minna: [grinning] I love that selective editing.
Madge (as Phin): [laughs] Totally unprompted, it just fell out from under me.
Minna (as Myra): I guess we better be careful when we go back upstairs.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. It’s really weak up there. You don’t know… you better- Can someone just help me up, please?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Minna: Myra offers her a hand up.
Madge (as Phin): Thank you.
Madge: And she’ll get up.
Rhi: Yeah. The desk however, Phin, as you wanted is shattered into many pieces.
Madge: Yay!
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, can you give me a favor real quick?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm?
Josie (as Minx): And check- My soul hasn’t left my body, has it?
Rhi: [suppressing giggles]
Minna: [quietly] Oh my God…
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… No? You’re still breathing, definitely.
Josie (as Minx): Everything’s fine. Everything’s fine.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re good.
Josie (as Minx): Phin’s okay, I’m okay, everything’s fine.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Everything’s cool.
Josie (as Minx): We are not splitting up again, just so you all know.
Kim (as Blaire): Aw.
Minna (as Myra): That’s fine with me, although we had better be careful.
Madge (as Phin): I’m splitting away from the group to dig through this debris.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge (as Phin): I got a 6! [laughs]
Rhi: So Phin, as the others are talking you start digging through, and Myra makes it like two steps in your direction before you like straighten up triumphantly with a ring of keys in your hand.
Madge (as Phin): Ha-ha! [laughs]
Rhi: The keys are not labeled, but they’re all fairly heavy looking important keys. I’ll say there’s five of them.
Madge: Does one of them look like it could be a skeleton key?
Rhi: Yeah, you know what, yes. I’ll say that one of them is.
Madge: Cool.
Josie (as Minx): Well that is quite fortunate.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): But now we need to find something worth opening.
Madge (as Phin): Well, basements or master bedrooms or something like that will probably be locked, especially if people have been carted off from here after they died, they’ll lock it to keep looters out.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. I was looking for secret compartments in case they had any knowledge on what the ring was.
Madge (as Phin): And how’d that go?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, I found some coin, and then you dropped in.
Madge (as Phin): All right. So, let’s head upstairs and try to find that master bedroom, yeah?
Josie (as Minx): Sounds fine to me.
Rhi: You make your way up to the third floor since Blaire and Myra pretty much determined the master bedroom didn’t seem to be on the second floor. You get up to the third floor, start looking around, and you do eventually find what you’re guessing probably leads to the master bedroom as it’s a set of very finely carved double doors, the handles of which have been chained shut and locked with a padlock.
Kim: Let me get at that.
Rhi: Well, I mean, Phin has that ring of keys, so you can check that first.
Kim: Oh, right.
Madge: Yeah. Let’s try the keys. Use item, skeleton key.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I will admit it’s somewhat strange opening locked doors the normal way.
Rhi: The skeleton key doesn’t work on this, because it’s not like a padlock that’s part of the doors in the house necessarily, but one of the other keys does open it up and you’re able to pull the chains off. You gonna open up the doors?
Madge: Yep.
Rhi: All right. Phin, I assume you’re doing the opening.
Madge: [nervously] Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: So you pull open the doors, and a skeleton kind of falls onto your legs.
Minna (as Myra): Oh–
Josie (as Minx): [howls in fright]
Kim (as Blaire): Ah!
Madge (as Phin): Okay! All right! Okay! Okay! I’m done! Nope!
Josie (as Minx): Minx is very suddenly about 20 feet away.
Rhi: [laughs]
Madge (as Phin): I shake my legs. I like kick the skeleton off.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s not like actively grabbing on you. It seemed like it was up against the door.
Madge (as Phin): It’s not an alive skeleton, but it still freaks me out!
Rhi: Oh yeah. Yeah. Basically you opened the door and it seemed like it was kind of up against the door, and when you opened it up it just fell forward, and it’s now in a sort of dusty, not really held together heap on the ground.
Madge (as Phin): [huffs]
Rhi: Those of you who are still close to the door, so everyone but Minx who’s now at the far end of the hall, can see that the inside of the door has scratch marks.
Kim: Oh shit.
Madge: Oh, this is pleasant.
Minna: [with pity] Oh…
Madge: Phin’s gonna step over the skeleton, [laughs] and start looking around the bedroom.
Josie: Minx will very slowly enter the room after everyone else has.
Josie (as Minx): Listen, I know our profession is a hard one, but it baffles me how the rest of you are so much less phased by this.
Minna (as Myra): I mean, it’s nothing attacking us.
Madge (as Phin): I worked with fish guts every day from when I was three.
Josie (as Minx): I don’t see how fish guts translates to human skeletons in haunted houses, but I’ll take your word for it.
Madge (as Phin): It drops a layer of not being phased by any shit.
Josie (as Minx): [deep exhale]
Rhi: All right. So, how do you guys wanna go about searching the room here?
Madge: If there’s a vanity or something I’ll go to that and start searching.
Rhi: Do you guys just all wanna do a group action to search the room as a whole?
Players: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Who is going to lead the group action?
Josie: I have 6 stress open.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, so just let me know what skill you’re all rolling.
Josie: I’m doing Survey.
Minna: Survey sounds good~
Josie: I got a 1.
Minna: I got a 5!
Kim: I got a… 1.
Madge: I got a 6.
Rhi: Six, okay. The result is a 6. Minx, you’re gonna take 2 points of stress.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You guys kind of fan out across the room and start looking around, opening drawers, checking wardrobes. Phin, you don’t find anything in the vanity but then you go to the bedside table and you find in a drawer an old, kind of cracked, but still intact journal. It appears to have been the personal journal of Omid Narathi who was the lord of the Narathi house at the time of the plague. Some of it’s hard to read just because of the age, like some pages stick together and you don’t want to pull them apart lest the whole thing crumble, you know, the pages have yellowed pretty badly, the ink is hard to make out at some points, but you are able to get the general gist of it. A lot of it is just the very boring daily diary reporting of things.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But then, kind of through the last several months, there’s mention of the plague, of deaths, of people getting sick. He mentions that he has dismissed his entire staff for fear of contamination and illness. Then, there’s sort of some comments as he’s going that Yara doesn’t seem to care at all about the plague and everything, he just keeps working at his art as if somehow that’s going to be worthwhile or profitable even when all this is over. The last few pages, the handwriting gets really bad and it becomes even more difficult to read, but you’re able to pick out that Lord Omid contracted the plague, and the last entry is just kind of scrawled across a page of ‘he locked me in here,’ ‘he’s going to let me die and take the estate,’ things along those lines.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Mmm.
Madge (as Phin): Well, that certainly worked out for Yara, a big, empty estate in a quarantined district that no one can ever reach again. Huh.
Josie (as Minx): I suspect there are many similar tales around this district.
Madge (as Phin): Yup.
Rhi: There is mention kind of earlier on when he’s complaining about Yara’s painting, he does make mention a few times of Yara being locked up in his studio all day.
Josie (as Minx): And there’s nothing hidden in the bedroom?
Rhi: You do find, sort of collectively as you’re doing your search, you find another 3 coin worth of money and jewelry and valuables.
Madge: Cool.
Josie (as Minx): I think perhaps each of you should take one since I helped myself earlier. I think the studio is our next destination.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. I think it’s worth checking out.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi: So, basically at the other end of the third floor, you find another bedroom and next to it is a door that is locked. The bedroom is covered in the same paintings that you had seen downstairs. There’s also a lot of books in here.
Minna: What kind of books?
Rhi: The pages are pretty badly damaged, some of the covers are damaged beyond being able to recognize them, but for where you can read the titles some of them are like art books, art history, technique, that sort of thing. There’s also a number of occult arcane books. Some of them you recognize the titles, Myra, as ones that you came across in the library in your research. The books that he has of the arcane seem to relate to either ideas of sorcery which is sort of a catch-all for different types of magic that aren’t really as well understood, and there’s a number of histories, and there’s a stack of books that are religious in nature. They seem to be affiliated with the Church of Ecstasy.
Josie: That sounds like a fun church.
Rhi: Yeah, Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh. It’s the state religion.
Minna (as Myra): It’s fun except for the part where some people volunteer to be literally hollowed out and purified, quote unquote “purified.”
Josie (as Minx): Ah. That’s less fun.
Rhi: Yeah. They find the soul to be evil and an abomination. They revere the physical body. In some ways it leads to very good things, in other ways it leads to people having their souls removed from their bodies.
Josie: Ah.
Rhi: It’s a mixed bag. There’s a small number of books that seem to be religious in nature, and those have additional pieces of paper stuck in them like marking pages and things.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: In the bedroom there is another door that is locked.
Josie: We have a skeleton key.
Madge: We do.
Rhi: Phin, you’re able to go over, open up the door, this does appear to be the studio. There’s a number of canvases leaning up against the wall, more paintings hanging on the walls in here, there’s a table that seems to be covered in paint and paintbrushes and other art supplies. In the middle of the room there is an easel with a half-finished painting on it. It’s a weird painting. It looks like he was painting while looking into the ghost field. Everything’s very washed out, and then there’s kind of like bright sections of vague humanoid forms where there were spirits.
Josie: Hmm.
Rhi: Kind of in the back of the room is a large pile of rags, basically, it looks like. In front of the half-finished painting is another skeleton, collapsed on the floor, curled in on itself.
Josie: Oh dear. Minx is gonna kind of softly give the skeleton a wide birth, but go over to the painting and just sort of gingerly tap at it a few times.
Rhi: It’s a painting.
Josie: All right.
Rhi: Yeah, painting doesn’t do anything.
Josie: I’m gonna take this one. It’s the only unique piece in this entire place.
Rhi: [chuckles] I assume everybody else is kind of moving into the room?
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Minna: I’m gonna go look at the skeleton.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, you look at the skeleton, and it’s not exactly in the fetal position but it’s a little bit curled up and has both arms kind of curled up to its chest. You can see on one hand there is a ring—
Minna: A pitted iron ring?
Rhi: Indeed. Just as you notice that, the pile of rags in the back stirs.
Kim: [deep inhale]
Minna: [seethes] I don’t suppose that’s just a rat, is it?
Rhi: It’s a very large pile of rags, and it shifts and starts to rise.
Josie: Take it and let’s go. We should be leaving.
Kim: I want to Attune!
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, you very quickly look into the ghost field, and when you do that you realize with no small amount of horror exactly what this thing is. You’ve heard about these, you’ve never actually encountered them.
Kim: Uh-huh.
Rhi: What you see is a sort of faint outline of a large being…
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: …inside of which are the glowing signatures of probably about a dozen spirits that are trapped within this outline.
Kim: Oh fuck.
Rhi: You realize that this is a harvester. You’ve never encountered one before, but you’ve read about them. they are creatures that devour ghosts, but rather than consuming them and destroying them the ghosts are just sort of held within them. harvesters will just consume more and more spirits becoming more bloated and powerful with life essence.
Kim: Oh shit.
Rhi: They’re quite dangerous, but even if you managed to kill one, killing one unleashes all of the ghosts inside of it, so you then have however many starving, angry ghosts that were trapped spilling out.
Kim: I guess I could maybe \do with help\. Can I tell, can I make a guess at how many spirits this harvester has, or no?
Minna: You said a dozen?
Rhi: Yeah, like a dozen, like 10 to 12.
Kim: Okay. Ten to 12 at once might be hard to handle.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a lot. So, you’ve got Blaire’s eyes glowing looking at this thing, her job probably drops. Minx is going uh, grab it and go, grab it and go. Phin, what are you doing?
Madge: Uh- [laughs] I am backing up and clutching my spiritbane charm.
Kim: I don’t know if that’s gonna do anything. This is like a mega ghost.
Madge: I am still trying. [laughs]
Minna: Yeah. I think Myra’s doing the exact same thing.
Rhi: Nobody’s grabbed the ring?
Minna: Myra’s going to grab the ring, but she’s clutching a spiritbane charm as she does.
Rhi: Yeah. You are able to wrench the ring off. As soon as you’re holding the ring it feels kind of oddly warm, and for a second you just really wanna slip it on your finger, but the moment passes.
Josie: Cool. We’ve got the one ring with us. That’s gonna be great.
Minna: I mean, every person we knew of who has seemed to possess it was later arrested for cannibalism~
Josie: Hooray. [laughs]
Rhi: Meanwhile, the harvester has risen up to its full height of about eight feet.
Kim: Hoo.
Rhi: It mostly appears to be just sort of a very large humanoid that’s draped in rags. There’s not really a face, but there are two glowing points of light vaguely where you would expect eyes to be, and it kind of swings around and is going to start advancing on whoever is closest, which I think is probably Blaire.
Kim: Ack! Okay.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: What are you all gonna do?
Kim: Oh, hmm-hmm, what can I [inaudible mumbling]
Josie: I see it as just an inanimate pile of rags, right?
Rhi: Yeah. I don’t know that Blaire has explained what this thing is yet.
Kim: Will one of my lightning hooks harm it? I imagine it would, right?
Rhi: It might do something. You can give it a shot.
Kim: All right. I’m gonna mark off a lightning hook on my inventory. I’m gonna hold my lightning hook at the ready.
Rhi: So, Blaire has just whipped out her lightning rod and is aiming it at this creature which is continuing to advance on her. The one thing that you’ve got going for you is that it is not speedy. It does not appear to be moving very quickly at the moment.
Kim: Oh, good.
Rhi: It’s just sort of lumbering towards Blaire.
Josie: Can I- I don’t know. Minx is kind of terrified right now.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Is anyone else intending to grab Blaire, or should I do it?
Madge: Um, how close am I to Blaire?
Rhi: I think you guys can all- It’s not a huge, huge room, so you guys can all be relatively close to each other.
Madge: Okay, then I’ll run forward and grab Blaire.
Rhi: What are you doing once you’ve grabbed her, pulling her back?
Madge: Yeah. I’m gonna start running backwards, because it is time to go! [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): No!
Josie (as Minx): Yeah.
Rhi: So Phin grabs Blaire and pulls her protesting out of the room, and I think when you guys sort of pass back through the door there’s this loud chorus of shrieking as if every ghost within the harvester just screamed, and it starts pursuing you. It’s moving a little faster now. You all make it through the bedroom out into the hall, and you hear a crash as it just kind of breaks through the wall Kool-Aid man style.
Josie: Oh geez. Throw shit at it? To slow it down and keep running.
Rhi: Yeah, so you’re throwing, knocking stuff over to try and get into its way, you hear stuff, it sounds like things are just kind of being crushed underfoot. As you guys reach the top of the stairs there’s another scream. Who’s at the back of the group?
Minna: It might be Phin. Didn’t Phin push Blaire out?
Kim: She kind of pulled me, so I have to imagine—
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: Okay. If you’re being pulled, I’m also down to be at the back of the group.
Rhi: All right! Myra volunteered. It lets out another chorus of screams and sends a lightning bolt of electroplasm—
Kim: What the fuck? It can do that?
Rhi: You could too, it’s a Whisper ability. It sends an arc of lightning, electroplasmic lightning arching through the ghost field and it slams into Myra.
Madge: [whines] No~
Rhi: Myra, you’re gonna take level 2 harm, Electrocuted.
Minna: I am gonna resist that. That’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay. you’ll take 1 point of stress. It’ll drop down to level 1, Zapped.
Josie: Can I light a lantern and throw it at it to try and catch it on fire? [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. You can definitely try and do that.
Josie: I wanna do that thing.
Rhi: All right. What are you gonna roll to do that thing?
Josie: I’m gonna do a Skirmish.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky.
Josie: I don’t know why I’m trying to do things tonight. I got a 2 and a 3.
Rhi: Oh no! [laughs] So, you light the lantern, you throw it, it hits the harvester, and the rags do burst into flame…
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: …but it doesn’t really seem to have much of an effect, it just keeps walking towards you and now it’s on fire and is setting the hallway around it on fire.
Josie (as Minx): Okay! Just keep running!
Minna (as Myra): Phin! How did you get the floor to break earlier? Can we do it again?
Madge (as Phin): Uh, it wasn’t on purpose!
Rhi: Or, you guys could run back to the study where Phin fell through and just jump down that way.
Minna: Shit, that’s right.
Josie: Oh, yeah, that’s a thing we can do.
Madge: Yeah, let’s do that. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: To specify what the consequence was of that bad roll, I’m going to be starting a clock for—
Josie: Place burns down?
Rhi: Yeah, “the house goes up in flames”, and we’ll make that a 6. So, you guys run to the study. You can either just jump and take level 1 harm, or you can make some kind of roll to climb down more carefully but it’s gonna take a little more time, and you still have this thing coming up behind you setting everything on fire.
Madge: I’ll go down carefully and I’ll do a Finesse roll for that.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Oh, I also have climbing gear.
Rhi: Oh, wonderful.
Josie: That’s a thing.
Rhi: Yeah. You can set up climbing gear, and then if you just leave it everybody else can climb down it as well.
Madge: Yeah, and I’ll do that.
Rhi: Okay. yeah, so go ahead and make your roll.
Madge: That’s a 2.
Rhi: Okay. so you tie off the rope, throw it down, swing yourself down on the rope and start climbing down, and you’re about half way down. The floorboard beam that you had tied the rope to also gives way, so you fall, the climbing gear comes down with you, and everybody else is not gonna be able to take advantage of it.
Kim: Ugh.
Madge: Okay.
Rhi: But, you’re down, and I’m gonna say that with the time it took for you to secure that and then climb down, the house is more on fire.
Kim: Whoops.
Josie: [groans]
Madge: Great.
Rhi: Yep. Who’s next?
Josie: I think- I don’t know. I think Minx might just take the jump.
Rhi: Okay. I think it’s just gonna be Bruised, you just kind of land in a roll and get banged up a little bit.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Minx is now on the first floor.
Minna: I’m going to attempt to Prowl.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: That’s a 4.
Rhi: Okay. you also are able to climb down. You don’t get hurt, but it takes a little while, because you’re trying to be careful about it, so we’re gonna tick that clock up again. The harvester is closing in and setting everything on fire. There’s just a lot of fire.
Josie: [nervous noises]
Rhi: Blaire, you are the only one still upstairs. How do you wanna get down?
Kim: Am I rolling anything to just jump?
Rhi: If you’re just gonna jump and take the level 1 harm, no, you don’t roll.
Kim: All right. I’ll take the harm.
Rhi: Okay. yeah, you also just take Bruised. What I’m picturing is like everyone else is kind of scrambling down Blaire is the last one, she kind of hesitates and looks back just as the harvester comes in the doorway, and she’s just like ‘fuck this!’
Kim: Yep!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And jumps down. [laughs] All right! You guys are all on the first floor. The ceiling above you is starting to smolder.
Josie (as Minx): Let’s get out of here. Let’s keep going.
Kim: Yep!
Madge: Yeah, we’re going.
Rhi: I think at this point you’re able to book it out of the house. You made it to the first floor. You burst out the doors and take off running into The Lost District. How far are you gonna run before slowing down?
Minna: Far!
Josie: Yeah, as far as we can.
Rhi: [laughs] All right. So eventually you guys do have to slow down a bit, because none of you are marathon sprinters. Phin is probably still doing okay, but-
Madge: Yay.
[chuckles]
Rhi: You guys slow down and look back and you can see flames sort of licking up over the tops of buildings and a pillar of smoke rising up, but nothing seems to be following you, so you make your way back through the district to the Silver Nails encampment, and a couple of the Silver Nails seem to be on patrol outside walking together. When they see you they both kind of reach for their side arms, and then—
Josie (as Minx): It’s just us. It’s the tourists.
Rhi (as Guard): Holy shit. You’re alive?!
Josie (as Minx): yeah! Yeah.
Madge (as Phin): Yep.
Kim (as Blaire): yeah.
Rhi: One of the guards is Zuri who Blaire rode over with, and she just heaves a huge sigh.
Rhi (as Zuri): Damn it. I lost another bet.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Did you bet against us?
Madge (as Phin): I would’ve.
Rhi: She just gestures at Phin. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Seriously?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Rhi (as Zuri): Yeah. I was not expecting you all to come back. We heard gunshots a little while ago, and then nothing, and figured that was probably it.
Josie (as Minx): To be fair, there was a harvester.
Rhi (as Zuri): A- I’m sorry. There’s a harvester?!
Kim (as Blaire): [stretched] Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): I wouldn’t go… uh, we’ll tell you where the mansion is. I wouldn’t go there.
Rhi: [laughing] I think the other guard kind of leans over like:
Rhi (as Guard): Is that smoke?
Minna (as Myra): It’s on fire.
Kim (as Blaire): It- All right, yeah, it’s on fire. We- We set it on fire.
Rhi (as Guard) The harvester? The harvester’s on fire?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie: [fights a giggle]
Minna (as Myra): I believe the thought was that it might help slow it down, but I don’t think it worked out that way.
Rhi (as Guard): N-Nope. No.
Kim (as Blaire): Most of us were panicked.
Rhi (as Guard): I- You know, I—
Minna (as Myra): Harvester comes after you, you just do whatever you can.
Josie (as Minx): Usually fire kills things that aren’t ghosts.
Rhi (as Guard): I understand the logic. I do, but…
Minna (as Myra): Oh God. Is it just gonna stay on fire?
Rhi (as Guard): I don’t know… Why don’t you come over here?
Rhi: They kind of bring you around to the front of the building.
Rhi (as Guard): Wait here. I’m gonna go let Sazari know about the situation.
Minna: I think that once we’re alone, Myra’s gonna turn to Minx and be like:
Minna (as Myra): Oh God, what if we’ve burned down The Lost District?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, to be fair, it was already lost.
Rhi: So, you hear some yelling from inside, kind of indistinctly, and then four of the Nails come tearing out like with their horses and just go riding off into the district, and then behind them Sazari comes out.
Rhi (as Sazari): This is why we don’t usually bring people here.
Josie (as Minx): That is entirely fair and justified, and we would like to be leaving promptly.
Rhi (as Sazari): [heavy sigh]
Minna (as Myra): Whenever you are next crossing.
Rhi (as Sazari): Oh no, we’re gonna have you head out right now.
Rhi: Sazari and a few others come out with their horses and pull you guys up onto the horses and you go riding back across The Deathlands. By this point it’s just barely past dawn, so you can see like just the faint end of the visible sun in the sky. You ride back to the point in the lightning barrier. This time Sazari is the one to go and fiddle with something and create the gap. The horses jump through, and then Sazari basically lights a flare and sticks it in the ground at the river bank.
Rhi (as Sazari): Someone should be by in a couple hours. We kind of have to go deal with the situation now, so um, good luck.
Rhi: And then they head out, they all mount back up and jump back through. It’s not a couple hours. You guys have to like hang out there for about an hour, but you’re inside the lightning barrier so it’s not too bad. The ferry comes back across with two Silver Nails on it kind of pulling it across, and they get you back to Duskwall.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, precious Duskvol, precious shitty Duskvol, I never thought I’d be so glad to see you.
[laughter]
Rhi: So yeah. You guys made it back. You got the item you were looking for plus a good deal of money. You may or may not have set half the district on fire, but you know, not where anybody that you care about lives.
Madge: Yeah. No one lives there.
Rhi: There’s a few Silver Nails.
Josie: Except The Silver Nails, but they can just move.
Madge: Yeah!
Rhi: Yeah. They can leave. They got horses. They’re mobile.
## Downtime [1:07:41]
Rhi: All right! So, downtime activities. Let’s start with Minx.
Josie: I mean, I did take like that half-finished painting, so like while I’m indulging in the art gallery and getting that fenced and stuff like that I just keep flashing back to all the paintings in the house and what it took to just get that one painting, and just feeling myself running down the halls past all these paintings again, and just generally having a very bad time with flashbacks.
Rhi: Yeah, and it’s not very relaxing, it doesn’t get rid of a lot of stress.
Josie: Nope. [laughs]
Rhi: So Minx is not having the best time ever at an art gallery.
Josie: Nuh-uh.
Rhi: Myra, what are you up to?
Minna: So, does everyone just kind of agree that Myra takes care of the ring?
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Okay. I think that Myra is left holding the ring when everyone else is kind of broken up after their harrowing adventure. She just like turns the ring over in her hand and just thinks back to all the terrible stories she’s heard about it, like cannibalism and a sorcerer killing his own son to make it potentially, the fact that it draws on human blood to do what it wants to do… and she just shivers a little bit at the idea of anybody actually using it. She heads straight for the vault. She climbs down the ladder and finds, I think there’s probably some drawers in there somewhere, and she puts it in a drawer all on its own and closes it up, and climbs hastily back up and just breathes a sigh of relief when the vault locks behind her.
Rhi: All right. Uh… so you guys have that hanging out in your base now. Phin.
Madge: Yeah!
Rhi: What do you get up to?
Madge: Phin is actually reading books [laughs] about certain subjects so that she can upgrade her Insight a little more. I’m trying to think of what kind of books she would read, but she’s reading, improving it basically. It’s rough, but it helps.
Rhi: Okay. yeah, so Phin just swipes some books from Blaire or Myra’s stash and- [laughs]
Madge: Yep.
Minna: She doesn’t have to swipe it. She can just ask.
Madge: Nope. I swipe.
Rhi: [laughs] Listen. Listen. … You’re thieves.
Madge: I have a thing!
[giggling]
Rhi: Okay, and Blaire.
Kim: Yeah. Blaire’s held up in her room really intently poking around at these weird rocks.
Rhi: Okay. you do some like, you go digging through your books, because you’re like I’ve gotta figure out what these runes mean.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: You’re able to find in one of the older books that you have some symbols that look similar to these runes that seem to be about healing and protection, and there’s one that the best translation is like ‘leech,’ of like drawing something out.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: The idea that you get is that maybe they were trying to use these as part of their treatment of the plague.
Kim: Mm-hmm, yeah.
Rhi: But you’re not sure like how they would have worked or if they would have worked at all, but you at least managed to kind of figure out their purpose in your study, and you’re like really proud of yourself after working it all out.
Kim: Cool.
Rhi: I think where we’ll wrap up is, you know, after you guys kind of all go to take care of your various things, you come back together as you so often do at The Hound’s Paw, and you guys can sit down at your table, and Rigney comes over with your drinks and is eyeing you all looking a little worried.
Rhi (as Rigney): Uh, hey, is everything all right? You look a little shaken, collectively.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, we’re just- Things got tight for a moment, but we’re fine.
Rhi (as Rigney): All right. Well…
Rhi: He reaches into his pocket and pulls out an envelope.
Rhi (as Rigney): Those reporter friends of yours dropped by again. They wanted to know if you could come up to their offices next time you had a chance.
Rhi: He sets the envelope down on the table and heads back to the bar.
Josie (as Minx): [sighs] That should be much more pleasant and normal.
Minna: Waits for that to be absolutely not the case. [snickers]
Rhi: I just smiled the biggest smile.
Josie & Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: Whoever opens up the envelope, it’s just a quick note from Lani that says: “Found some new leads, need your help, stop by as soon as you can.”

Minna: [laughing] Oh God! Is it just gonna stay on fire?!
Rhi: [laughs] Was that in or out of character?

Transcript created by Lyra Song.
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for listening. Your reviews, ratings, tweets, #MagpiesLiveCallEpisode livetweeting, and amazing fanart mean the world to us. We love seeing all of it.
Only one announcement this time, and it is that I will be at AcadeCon in Dayton, Ohio this November. If you’re going, track me down and get a cool Magpies bookmark.
Next, Minna is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Minna: According to the True Colors Fund, as many as 1.6 million youth experience homelessness every year, and up to 40% of that number are LGBT+. In Pinellas County, Florida, Family Resources and local stakeholders and community partners gathered to talk and develop a strategic plan to address this problem locally. Safe Connections Resource Center is part of their strategic plan to provide homeless youth with a central point of access for needed services that are imperative to their safety and survival, including basic needs assessment, counseling, and referrals. Family Resources is raising money to renovate a building and open the Resource Center, which is meant for LGBT+ youth and young adults up to the age of 24. If you would like to help make Safe Connections possible, go to www.giveakidahome.org to make a donation. That’s www.giveakidahome.org.
Rhi: If you’re able, consider donating a few dollars. In addition, for our American listeners, please check to make sure you’re registered to vote. There have been continuing issues with voter registration throughout the country, and ensuring early that you are registered is one of the best ways to defend against voter suppression. In addition, please visit 5calls.org and contact your representatives. It’s critical that they know their votes in Congress will determine your vote in the midterms.
Now, then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## [00:02:03] Story resumes
Rhi: Previously, you all had made a deal with The Silver Nails to get you into The Lost District to locate an artifact The Circle of Flame was interested in. You infiltrated a black market auction, stole some Spirit Warden uniforms, and, in exchange for those uniforms, The Silver Nails got you into The Lost District, where you had exciting run-ins with ghost dogs and collapsing floorboards and harvesters that almost set the entire district on fire.
Josie: Yes, it was the harvester that did that, not us.
Rhi: [laugh] After you all had returned to Duskwall and recovered from your various encounters, you got a note from Lani and Roxanne that basically said they had made a break in their research into The Circle of Flame, and asked you to come over to The North Hook Mirror offices as soon as you were able.
So, I think we open up in, once again, Lani and Roxanne’s very small, cramped, note-filled office. They both look a little agitated and disturbed. Roxanne gestures for you to close the door, and once it’s shut, Lani picks up a sheaf of papers and spreads them out in front of her, and then starts signing with Roxanne interpreting.
Rhi (as Lani): We’re looking into a number of leads on The Circle of Flame. After you confirmed that Ambassador Avrathi was part of it, we were looking into her dealings. We’ve been continuing to look into The Centuralia Club, and that’s where we got our break. In the last month or so, six servants who worked at The Centuralia Club have gone missing.
Minna (as Myra): Ooh.
Rhi (as Lani): Duskwall… People go missing all the time. But they usually don’t all work at the same place, and it doesn’t happen this quickly. We’ve talked with some family and friends of the people who have disappeared, and they all said that the people they knew who worked at the club went there for work as usual, and then just never came back. Now, we’re pretty sure that the reason nothing’s been done is because of, you know, bribes in the right places. But if we… Well, if you can find evidence or proof of what happened to these people, tying it to The Centuralia Club or The Circle of Flame, and we go public with it, no amount of bribes is going to keep The Inspectors from doing their work. So, we need you to get into the club and find out anything you can.
Josie (as Minx): [gasp] We get to go into The Centuralia Club! This is the dream! Sorry, why are we even going in, again?
Madge (as Phin): Because we need to expose corrupt people?
Josie (as Minx): Ah, yes. Quite right. Ahem. Um, and, indeed, with security in that place, it is most likely an inside job, so, yes, we will need to thoroughly inspect the interior of the club. Yes.
Rhi: Roxanne, as she’s translating this for Lani, rolls her eyes a little bit. Lani shakes her head, leans over the desk, and pulls out a sack of coin and sets it on the desk. She adds:
Rhi (as Lani): This is the money that we owe you for the copy of that letter you gave us, and what little we could scrape together for this job. It’s 4 coin total. Hopefully that’s enough for what we’re asking. We’re pretty sure that if we can go public with this information, we can… I don’t think this will take them down, but I think it’ll do some serious damage.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, it’ll be enough.
Josie (as Minx): This should indeed be sufficient. The club shall provide payment of its own, but funds to get in the door are always appreciated.
Rhi (as Lani): We don’t really have much information that we can share. I think you probably know more about the club than we do at this point. But if there’s anything that we can do to help as you’re preparing, just let us know.
Josie (as Minx): We shall. And thank you. You’ve done quite a bit already.
Rhi: Any other info you would like to get out of the two of them?
Josie: Not especially. They’ve given us quite a bit already.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I’ll sign goodbyes.
## [00:06:39]
Rhi: The four of you head back to The Nest to start planning your next moves. Blaire has been really quiet and thoughtful-seeming on the walk back, and as you all gather in the common room, her eyes suddenly go big, and she goes:
Kim (as Blaire): [gasp] I have an idea!
Rhi: And runs off into her room.
Kim: Blaire rushes off into her room. She kneels onto the ground and reaches for this medium-sized trunk that she keeps under her bed. She opens it. It is velvet-lined on the inside, and the scrying crystal sphere is in there. And she’s gonna pick it up very carefully, pet it, dust it off a little. There’s no dust on it, but she’s just stroking it to get the Eye’s attention, like:
Kim (as Blaire): Hey, little guy. Remember me? It’s been awhile.
Rhi: The Eye very quickly swivels around and looks at you, and is twitching a little bit. It seems to be almost expectant.
Kim: Mm.
Kim (as Blaire): Ah, you missed me!
Rhi: Twitch, twitch, twitch.
Kim and Rhi: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): [sigh] Okay. I need to know what the connection is with all these missing persons at The Centuralia Club.
Rhi: You are focusing on that, and you’re holding the Eye.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. It is eye-level with me. I’m holding it very close to my face.
Rhi: It keeps twitching a little bit, and then it makes eye contact with you. Your vision whites out for a second. Then, your eyes are still open, and if you focus really hard, you can see your room, you can see your hand holding the Eye in front of your face. But overlaid in front of that is a not-very-large, low-ceilinged room. Three of the walls are made out of stone; one of the walls looks like it’s made out of steel plates, almost the kind of thing that would make up the hull of a ship. In the middle of the room is a large stone slab that’s at about a 45-degree angle. It’s pained with arcane runes and there are leather restraints.
Kim: [gasp] Ooh, okay.
Rhi: Like, hanging open. The floor and the ceiling below and above the slab are also painted with runes. You can also see off to one side there’s a small table. It holds some bottles, some papers, some tomes. You’re standing in such a way that you can’t see the door, and, physically, you turn a little bit to look, and there’s a little bit of a delay, but your vision slowly shifts—not at the same rate that your head turns, but it kind of drifts, turning—and behind you is the door. It seems like you are able to move with this a little bit. This’ll be, basically, your Gather Information roll to see what else you can find out. You could do Attune, you could do Survey, you could do Study. It just depends on how you wanna approach.
Kim: I’m okay with Attune. I’m gonna role that.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: 5.
Rhi: Okay, you get a standard amount of information. You slowly turn and see the door. You drift through the door, and it leads you out into a very small hallway. There’s another door a little bit down the hallway from you on your other side; there is a flight of stairs leading up. Which way do you head?
Kim: I know I have a limited amount of time, but I’m not sure if I want to leave this room just yet. I’m interested—do I recognize the runes written on this slab or the ceiling or the floor? Can I read them?
Rhi: Yeah. If you turn back and go to look, on the slab a lot of the runes have to do with binding and restraint. The ones on the floor and ceiling have to do with knowledge and sight. But that is pretty much what you’re able to see. You have a general sense of the layout. It feels like it might be a basement, but that’s really all you’re able to see before your vision starts to fade, and you can tell that if you pushed more energy into it, you could maintain the connection. As this one minute ends, you take 5 stress.
Kim: Woah! Oh, lordy! Okay. I am… I am not gonna maintain the connection.
Rhi: Tell me what happens as Blaire breaks this connection.
Kim: Her peripheral vision just stretches. It’s almost as if she’s being sucked through a wormhole, and all of a sudden, she is just back in her body; she is jostled back into the present. She is just… Immediately, a buzzing in her head. She is so disoriented. She still has the Eye in her hands. She doesn’t drop it. She’s aware enough to know that there’s something fragile in her hands, and she’s not about to drop it. But she is completely out of sorts, to the point where, for a few seconds, I think, she is not even aware of where she is.
Rhi: The door to Blaire’s room creaks open after a couple minutes, and she staggers out. She is ashen pale, she’s got blood coming from her nose, does not look steady on her feet, her eyes are bloodshot.
Josie (as Minx): Oh my goodness.
Rhi: She just goes:
Kim (as Blaire): I… saw some things.
Rhi: And then collapses.
Minna (as Myra): She used the Eye? She used the Eye, didn’t she?
Minna: Myra runs forward.
Madge: Phin is shortly after.
Josie: Minx is gonna scramble to get something under her head and be like:
Josie (as Minx): No! Precious baby, we’ll take care of you!
Rhi: Blaire, it looks like she just fainted. She comes to after a few moments. If any of you ask “did you use the Eye,” she winces, and she explains that while you all were preparing for the Embassy score, she had held the eye and thought about Avrathi and got this split second flash of Avrathi’s office, so she thought she could do that again to see if she could figure something out about the club. And it worked; she did. She tells you what she saw by looking in there. But she looks in pretty bad shape now.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Well, looks like we might have a place to investigate.
Madge (as Phin): Mhmm.
Josie (as Minx): I don’t especially want to go to such a place, but…
Rhi: You guys are able to help her up and get her into bed. She keeps saying:
Kim (as Blaire): I just need to get some rest, and then I’ll be fi—
Rhi: And then she passes out again.
Josie: Minx insists on there being a small meal and a glass of water next to her bed.
Rhi: That’s Blaire’s contribution to the Gather Information phase. She is going to be recovering from it for the rest of the session, ‘cause using that Eye takes a whole lot of stress.
Josie: Mhmm.
Rhi: Also, before you guys get into the Gather Information phase for yourselves, just to refresh on what you had learned about the club previously when you had investigated quite a while ago: Phin knows where two guards at the club live, and knows that one of them is about her size in terms of uniform. You guys know that it costs 4 coin to get in the front door, and that there is either some kind of passcode or token or something that you have to offer at the door in order to get in. I think those are the key things that you know. But you are free to do other investigating.
Josie (as Minx): I think something that will inform our investigations is, do we want to send in anyone legitimately, or shall we all be deceiving and sneaking our way in?
Madge (as Phin): If you want us to be in there by your own coin, you can totally do that, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): It’s simply a matter of the feasibility of getting in otherwise, and whether that’s within our capability.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. We can pay for at least one person to get in, I think, and that person can be you. I know where I can get a uniform roughly in my size, given that my girl isn’t one of the people who’s been taken, and we can track down a second.
Rhi: The guards that Phin knows about, there’s two of them. They live in the same place. So, in theory, if you get both of those uniforms, Phin and Myra could get in as guards, and Minx could go in the front door.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: I will also add, you do know that thanks to some of your doings, some of the doings of an unknown, mysterious incident on a cargo ship, the numbers of the guards at the club have been thinned, so having new guards showing up might be plausible.
Josie (as Minx): That does seem like a solid plan. I shall enter through the front by way of payment, and you all shall enter through the guard passage.
Rhi: You’ll need to get the uniforms first.
Josie: Let’s get those. Those are pretty important.
Madge: Mhmm.
Rhi: Okay. What I’m thinking, then, is I’ll have you guys do a group Gather Information check. You’ll all pick whatever action you’re gonna do. The result of that Gather Information will determine what you’re able to get out of this uniform theft.
Madge: Okay. I’m gonna be using Prowl for this one.
Minna: I’m also going to use Prowl. I did 5.
Madge: I got a 6.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Cool. That means the result is a 6. You’re able to get the uniforms. Phin, since you got the 6, do you wanna narrate how it all goes off without a hitch?
Madge: I think it runs like the embassy score should have run. [laugh]
Josie: [laugh]
Madge: Minx and Myra down in front distracting anyone who would be poking their nose into what’s going on; then Phin sneaks in through a window—through their window, specifically; the guards, their window—and is able to get in and out without anyone stopping her.
Rhi: So, you’ve got two pristine uniforms for The Centuralia Club guards. Any other prep stuff you wanna do, or do you just wanna launch straight into the score?
Madge: Let’s launch it.
Josie: Yeah, let’s do this shit.
Rhi: We’re gonna start with Minx heading up the path through the gates towards the club. You get up to the front door, where there’s a pair of guards standing there. They look at you expectantly.
Josie: Indeed, indeed. I’m gonna pay them using the money we just got given. I’m dressed as best as I can; got a poofy skirt going on. I’ll introduce myself as Sonia Kross, with a K.
Rhi: [chuckle] One of the guards leads you around to the side of the building, to where there’s a small addon office, where he takes your money and puts it a safe, and has you sign an agreement. It’s basically a big, flowery non-disclosure agreement. After you’ve signed it, he gives you a medallion that has this very elaborate engraving of the club building itself. There’s some gold and silver plating on it. He hands it to you and says:
Rhi (as Guard): This is your club membership. As long as you hold this, you are a member of the club. If you lose it, if it stolen, then you lose your membership, and you will have to pay again to regain it. It is at our discretion if we grant you membership again if you are found to be careless with it. But hopefully that will not be a concern for you. Allow me to escort you inside.
Josie (as Minx): No need for such a worry. It shall not leave my person. Lead the way.
Rhi: He walks you back over to the doors. When you get there, he tells you:
Rhi (as Guard): When you come up to the doors, you show us the token like this.
Rhi: And he demonstrates. Once you’ve done it, he gives you an approving nod.
Rhi (as Guard): Welcome to The Centuralia Club.
Rhi: And the guards both push the doors open. Minx, you step into the entry hall and are almost completely overwhelmed by everything. There’s marble floors, marble columns that are woven with veins of gold and silver, there’s crystal chandeliers hanging above you, fine tapestries and beautiful art on the walls. In the back of this entry hall, there’s a wide marble staircase leading up to the second floor. There are open doorways all along the entry hall leading further into the club. All over, there are beautiful, wealthy people wearing beautiful, perfect clothing. The doors close behind you, and you are just standing there slack-jawed, which draws a few stares. People are noticing you.
Josie: But it’s so beautiful!
Rhi: We’re gonna pull away from Minx for a moment, leaving her gaping at the place of her dreams and cut around to the back of the club.
## [00:20:25]
Rhi: It’s a back alley that is fenced off. Myra and Phin, the fact that the two of you were wearing uniforms, you were able to talk your way past the guards who are at either end of the alley. The guard station, the room that you’re brought into, has a couple of tables and chairs. One of the tables has a few bottles of wine and some communal plates of food. There is a large weapons cage that has a very heavy, impressive-looking locked door in front of it. Sitting at a desk in front of this armory is a middle-aged man; tanned skin, same uniform, has a scar across his forehead. When the two of you are brought in, he looks up and frowns, and looks back and forth.
Rhi (as Guard): Uh, who are you?
Minna (as Myra): Just hired on today.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. We’re new.
Rhi (as Guard): Um, hm.
Rhi: He starts shuffling through his papers.
Rhi (as Guard): I wasn’t told to expect any new hires. Uh…
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, and we weren’t expecting to get hired. But then, people get killed and we have to fill in.
Rhi: He’s still eyeing you suspiciously. At this point, you guys will have to make a roll of some kind to persuade him that you’re totally supposed to be here.
Minna: I feel like the precedent we’ve set is that this would be a Sway.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: And it is risky.
Minna: Do we wanna do a group?
Madge: I can do it.
Minna: Oh, okay.
Madge: I mean, I’m the one who’s talking.
Minna: Okay.
Madge: I got a 4.
Rhi: Hmm… So they believe you, but there’s a consequence. Hang on. I gotta think about what a good consequence here would be. They believe you but something still goes wrong…
Josie: Could be, like, they immediately put you on some onerous task that would be hard to get away from.
Madge: Yeah, grunt work or something.
Minna: Yeah, I like that.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah.
Rhi (as Guard): Well, I don’t have you down, but it’s fine. Yeah, if… We do need some additional guards up on the second floor, so if you two wanna head up there, it’s pretty boring patrol work. Try not to pay too much attention to who you see and what you hear. We have a policy of maintaining the privacy of the club members, so…
Minna (as Myra): Right.
Madge (as Phin): Mhmm, mhmm, got it.
Rhi: Rather than pointing you out into the club proper, he actually gets up from the desk and walks over to another door behind him and opens it up. It just leads to a dark, narrow staircase that heads up.
Rhi (as Guard): We’ve got secret passages in the walls here all through the club. It lets us and the servants get around without being seen. Yeah, just stay on patrol up there; just through the halls. Make sure that nobody’s trying to break into anybody else’s room, or overdosed, or choking on their own vomit, or… You know. The usual sort of things.
Madge (as Phin): Okay, so, babysitting.
Rhi (as Guard): Yeah. You’re the new ones. Have fun.
Madge (as Phin): Great.
Rhi (as Guard): Shift’s up in four hours.
Rhi: And he points at the door.
Madge: Then Phin is gonna go.
Minna: Yeah.
Madge: Phin’s good at babysitting.
Minna: [laughing] She’s probably had to do quite a lot of it.
Madge: Yeah. [laugh]
Rhi: The two of you head up into this secret passage, up to the second floor.
## [00:23:58]
Rhi: Meanwhile, Minx, you are standing there, looking around. A couple people come up to you after you’ve been staring for a while. One of them is like:
Rhi (as Club Member): Uh, are you all right? Have you hit your head or something?
Josie (as Minx): Oh! No, no. Sorry. I was… It is my first time, and I was simply… I am– I am a bit of an architect, you see, and I was admiring the design.
Rhi (as Club Member): Ah, well, I mean, it’s [scoffing] not that good. It’s simply a repurposed manor home. If they’d built something from the ground up, this could have been truly spectacular. But I suppose it will do.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Although, perhaps that happening is not out of the question, at some point in the future. Is there a schedule about, or shall we simply retire?
Rhi (as Club Member): Oh, you can do whatever you like. There’s the dining hall, the music room, there’s some lounges, and then, for more private entertainment, you can head upstairs.
Josie (as Minx): Ah. I think I shall be enjoying the music room. Care to join me?
Rhi (as Club Member): [sigh]
Rhi: They look you up and down, and are clearly—not even trying to hide it—judging your clothes.
Rhi (as Club Member): Uh, no. We’re on our way elsewhere. But do have fun.
Josie (as Minx): Very well, very well.
Rhi: They head off.
Josie: All right. I think I will actually head towards the music room. Minx is maybe gonna take a little while to actually appreciate some things, and probably feel uncharacteristically embarrassed, being looked down on in this situation.
Rhi: Yeah. The music room is easy enough to find. There’s piano music and a vocalist that can be heard. There’s a couple people who seem to be actually listening to the music, bust most of the people in this room are having their own conversations, some of them pretty loud. One of them you hear, it’s a group of nobles standing off in a corner. One of them is very loudly complaining about having to find a new carriage driver.
Rhi (as Noble): The last one was so unreliable! He kept claiming sick family, but I’m certain it was drink. It’s just so hard to find good help these days.
Rhi: The others are acting very sympathetic, and complaining about a lot of their staff and the problems that they have with keeping good people around.
Josie: I don’t think Minx can stay in any one place too long, ‘cause if I am already visibly looked down upon, I will likely end up being the girl sitting alone. I don’t wanna be that; I don’t wanna draw attention right now.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Contrary to all of Minx’s instincts, [laughing] she is going to try to be subtle, and, in general, get the full layout of the place in those areas I can walk in.
Rhi: Okay. It seems like the front half of the first floor is open to you. You cross the hall and peek in and see the dining hall, which, basically, looks like a miniature restaurant and bar. There’s a lot of tables that are draped in linen and set with china. You can smell the food that’s being served. It’s unlike anything that you’ve ever smelled before; definitely nothing that you’ve ever had the coin to be able to afford to eat. Most of the nobles leave their plates half-eaten. It seems like a lot of the food is just being thrown out.
There’s a few rooms that are just lounges, sort of, where the lighting is a little lower. There’s a lot of couches and chase lounges where people are just sitting about on them. There’s a couple servants standing by, serving drinks and refreshments. There’s a side table that holds a silver bowl that is full of something that you have only ever read about. It is about half full of small apple slices. Apples are one of those things that everybody has heard of them, but it would be like for people in our status, in our world, of having a private jet. It’s not something that we every expect to be able to experience. There’s just a bowl of apples sitting out here in this room.
Josie: And I can just take them?
Rhi: Mhmm.
Josie: I’m gonna get a plate of apples.
Rhi: They are crisp and tart and sweet and delicious, and while you’re standing there savoring these apples, you are just looking around the room. There’s a trio of women standing off to the side. They have wine glasses, and they’re talking and laughing, and there’s a young man in a servants’ uniform kneeling down beside them, cleaning up spilled wine with a towel. Just as he finishes up, one of the women glances over and smirks, and just dumps the rest of her glass out on the floor and, partially, on him. Even from across the room, you can see him grit his teeth, and then stand up and apologize, and leave the room to go get a fresh towel. As soon as he’s turned his back, they all start laughing at him.
Josie: Minx has to stop herself from striding towards them. She takes one step, but then realizes that there’s a lot of people here and this is not the time. She’s gonna cover her mouth with her handkerchief, but just fucking fume for a little bit.
Rhi: I think that’s where we’ll leave Minx for the moment, just glowering at everyone in here.
Josie: Mhmm.
## [00:29:52]
Rhi: I think, cinematically, the camera goes up from Minx, up through the floor, to the hallway, where we see Phin and Myra walking down a hall that has a number of doors lining it. It seems like this area is reasonably soundproofed, but you can still hear muffled laughter, muffled moaning; a whole variety of interesting sounds coming from the other sides of these doors. There are a couple servants around, but don’t really seem to be any other guards. So, what would the two of you like to do?
Minna: I guess I’m trying to thing where we’re going to be trying to look for information about this.
Rhi: Well, from what Blaire told you, the vision that she had using the Eye, she thought that there was some kind of thing in an underground location.
Minna: So, we’d be trying to go down, if at all possible.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: There is the secret passages that you could try to check out and see where that will get you. You could also just try to head down the main stairs and see if you’re able to find your way anywhere.
Minna: If we can find the secret passages, that’d be best. I’m gonna, I think, maybe try a Survey.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I will follow with.
Minna: Uh, that’s a 4.
Rhi: The two of you very slowly move through the halls, looking at the walls, trying to see if you can find anything. As you’re doing this, you notice that one of the servant’s who’s up here is starting to notice that you’re not acting like normal guards on patrol. So, you can either withdraw and try a different approach, or you can do it but there is some kind of minor consequence.
Minna: I think I’m going to try a different approach.
Madge: I’m gonna stay on target.
Rhi: Okay, Phin is going to keep searching, so that’s gonna be a risky roll for you. Myra, what do you want to attempt?
Minna: If Phin’s gonna press on, I think Myra’s going to take her cue and also press on.
Rhi: Okay. Then Phin, go ahead and make roll to continue searching, but it is gonna be risky.
Madge: I’m gonna use a Prowl for this one. Okay, so, 6 and a 4.
Rhi: All right. You are able to find another secret passage that will lead you down. You step out into the kitchen, which is fairly large, very crowded, and very, very hot. There’s several ovens and stoves running; there are servants rushing around preparing food, carrying food out. A couple of them shoot you confused looks, but they are clearly too busy to slow down and do anything about the fact that the two of you have just wandered in here.
As you move into the kitchen, you see that the back door is open, and you hear shouting coming from that direction.
Madge: Someone’s in trouble! Let’s go look.
Rhi: [laughter]
Minna: All right.
Rhi: If you guys make your way over there, you see: filling most of the doorway, is a fairly tall, burly-looking man, also in a servants’ uniform, but his has a bit more of the brass detailing on it—it’s a little fancier than everybody else’s. He is mid-tirade, yelling at a young woman who’s in a regular servants’ uniform, who is not huddled on the ground, but hunched over on herself, curled in on herself and crying.
Madge: Yeah. She’s on the way to the ground, at this point, right?
Rhi: Yeah. As you get closer, you hear him.
Rhi (as Boss): You have no right to that! None. That is not for you! I don’t care where it is, if it’s on these tables or in the trash. That is not yours, and you are stealing from the club.
Rhi: You hear her in between the sobs.
Rhi (as Servant): [sobbing] It was… It was in the trash. It wasn’t going to be used, and my parents need the—
Rhi (as Boss): I don’t care!
Rhi: He shoves her back a step and is like:
Rhi (as Boss): Get out. You are done!
Rhi: She’s continuing to cry and plead with him.
Madge (as Phin): Sir?
Rhi: He stops, a little taken aback that anybody is addressing him, and whirls around.
Rhi (as Boss): What are you doing in here? Are you lost? The guard station is that way.
Madge (as Phin): I’m here to investigate the theft.
Rhi (as Boss): There’s nothing that needs to be investigated. I caught her pulling food out of the trash behind the place. There’s no investigation.
Madge (as Phin): I don’t really have any say on whether I wanna be here or not. They just told me something happened down here and I needed to come and get statements. So, are you gonna let me do my job, or do you wanna have the club be down another guard tonight?
Rhi: Gonna need to make a roll?
Madge: Yeah, I know.
Rhi: [laugh]
Madge: [nervous noises]
Josie: [laughter]
Madge: Okay, that sounds like a… That’s Sway, that’s what that is.
Minna: Or a Command, if you have that.
Madge: Ooh! Yeah.
Rhi: And this is gonna be risky.
Madge: I know, ‘cause I am per hour and he is salaried.
Rhi: Mhmm.
Minna: [laugh]
Madge: I rolled a 1.
Rhi: Oh no.
Minna: Oh no.
Josie: Oh God.
Madge: I messed up real bad, that’s what happened here.
Rhi: He just stares at you for a second, bewildered that anyone would dare talk to him this way, and then moves in toward you.
Rhi (as Boss): I am not doing a goddamn thing that you say. Get your ass out of my kitchen or I will have you fired, too. Now, go.
Rhi: You lose this opportunity. He’s just not—
Madge: I’m gonna… I know he’s not gonna do anything for me, but can I punch him?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, you sure can. Yup, you can 100% punch him.
Madge: Yeah, cool. ‘Cause he’s a jerk. [laughter]
Rhi: [laugh]
Madge: 6! [triumphant laugh]
Rhi: [laughing] Jesus.
Everyone: [laughter]
Minna: This is the most Phin thing ever, just this set of two rolls, here.
Rhi: Holy shit.
Josie: Yeah, you don’t talk to Phin like that.
Rhi: Tell me what this very solid hit looks like.
Madge: I’m picturing this guy as a mountain of a man. Is that correct?
Rhi: Yeah. He’s pretty tall.
Madge: Okay. And I’m a shrimp of a girl, aside from my muscles. So, uppercut! A big lil’ Doomfist-style jump and uppercut at the same time to get him square in the jaw.
Rhi: He was not expecting it at all.
Madge: Yeah, of course he wouldn’t. He wouldn’t expect anyone to raise a hand against him. He doesn’t even like people talking to him.
Rhi: Yeah. His head snaps back. You can see a little spurt of blood come out of his mouth. The kitchen goes dead silent.
Madge: [grunting] I do this.
Rhi: Everybody stops moving and just staring. He’s slowly lowering his head to look at you but hasn’t moved yet. He’s still also recovering from the shock of this. You guys have an opportunity to do something here, before this escalates further.
Madge: Everyone’s gone silent. I’m gonna look around, and I’m gonna be like:
Madge (as Phin): Get back to work!
Madge: Then I’m gonna run. [laugh]
Josie, Minna, and Rhi: [laughter]
Rhi: Yup. Where…? [laugh] Where are you running to?
Madge: Towards the girl who was getting chewed out, is there a path past her?
Rhi: I’ll tell you what the exits are. There’s the secret passage that you came through; there’s a hallway that leads to the guard station, that you can see; there’s a door that, when you guys first came in here, you saw swinging open and shut, that looks like it leads out into the main hall; and then there’s a cellar door that’s propped open and that is a flight of stairs heading down.
Madge: Okay. What I wanna do is I wanna do sort of a slingshot around the moon to get a trajectory sort of thing, where I slingshot around the Mr. Doucheface and grab the girl, and then head for the cellar.
Rhi: Okay, you’re gonna do that, and that will be a roll. Myra, what are you doing?
Minna: Do you think that Myra can tell Phin’s intentions, like, where’s she’s planning to go?
Madge: Oh, yeah. They’re best friends.
Minna: Okay. Then she’s just gonna run straight for the cellar.
Madge: Cool. Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Side note: this girl is ours now. We are adopting her.
Minna: Yes. Yes, yes. This is exactly what I wanted.
Rhi: All right. Let me come up with a name.
Minna: I also feel like Myra both expected this and understands exactly what Phin’s going for, because this just happens.
Rhi: Myra, I think that you are able to sprint to the cellar without any difficulty. Phin, you are pulling something that is a bit more complicated and, therefore, will require a roll of some kind.
Madge: Bringing rocket science into this. I’m guessing Finesse would be good for this, or Prowl.
Rhi: Prowl, probably, I feel like.
Madge: I’m gonna push myself. And that’s two stress. Aahh! 6.
Rhi: [laughing] God. You’re just on fire.
Madge: I love this little pink dice.
Josie: [laugh] Aww.
Rhi: As you’re whipping around this guy, he tries to get you with a haymaker, and, because you’re so much shorter, you easily duck under. You grab the girl, who is too stunned by this entire turn of events to resist you, and haul her across the kitchen, down into the cellar, and I assume, yank the door shut behind you.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. The three of you are now in the cellar. I think that the scene cuts on: the cellar door slams shut. Then we cut back over to Minx.
## [00:39:59]
Josie: Mhmm.
Rhi: Has Minx moved on from the lounge where she was enjoying some apples, or…?
Josie: Yes. She’s picking up the pace a little bit.
Rhi: You’ve looped the first floor and haven’t really seen, in the areas you have access to as a guest, anything that looks like it would lead to a basement. You have encountered a few closed doors, a couple of which, you’re guessing, lead back to the servants’ area, because you have seen servants go in and out with trays of food and drink and whatever. Then there’s one door that is closed and has a single guard standing in front of it that nobody has gone in or out of.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: I will say, at this point, you do hear from behind one of the doors that the servants were going in and out of, you hear a little bit of a commotion and some raised voices.
Josie: Mhmm.
Madge: I wonder what that was. [laugh]
Rhi: [laughter]
Josie: Yeah. I’ll approach the guard at the door, and say:
Josie (as Minx): Dear, is that normal commotion from what I presume to be the kitchen?
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, uh, I… Sorry, ma’am, I’m not sure what you’re talking about. I’m not hearing anything. I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Please, continue on; enjoy yourself here.
Josie (as Minx): Well—
Madge: “Be over here gaslighting our customers.” [chuckle]
Rhi: [laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Well, I mean, forgive me if I’m not familiar enough to know which sounds are proper or not, but it did indeed sound like multiple people clamoring and struggling in some fashion. It wasn’t just yelling.
Rhi (as Guard): It’s possible you also heard something from upstairs. Some people enjoy that sort of thing.
Josie (as Minx): Did quite distinctly hear it from behind that specific door, my dear.
Rhi: What are you trying to accomplish here?
Josie (as Minx): I’m trying to get him to go check through the door.
Rhi: Okay. Give me a roll, then.
Josie: Yes. Triple 6s!
Rhi: Jesus.
Josie: The devil’s number!
Minna and Rhi: [laughter]
Rhi: I think he sounds skeptical, or he’s kind of eyeing you skeptically, and starts opening his mouth to make another denial, and then there’s this loud shout from within the kitchen, and then a sound of what sounds like something falling down and breaking. The guard grimaces, and:
Rhi (as Guard): Ah…
Josie (as Minx): Yes. See, that’s what I was talking about.
Rhi (as Guard): Perhaps you’re correct, ma’am. I’ll go see what the trouble is. Please, don’t worry about it. I’m sure it’s just a– perhaps, difficulties with the staff. Uh, please, uh, enjoy yourself.
Madge: [extremely satisfied laughter]
Josie (as Minx): I will leave it in your capable hands.
Minna: [laugh]
Rhi: He heads off towards the kitchen.
Madge: He’s not wrong. [laugh]
Josie: I’m gonna slide on in that door, if I can.
Rhi: It’s locked.
Josie: Can I do something about that?
Rhi: I mean, you can try to.
Josie: Are things lockpicks something I have, or can that be covered in burglary gear or tinkering tools?
Rhi: You can definitely have the thing where you pull lockpicks out of your elegantly-styled hair.
Josie: Yes, I will absolutely do that and try to pick it, and try to look casual about it.
Rhi: You are trying to pick a lock in a well-lit area with a lot of other people around.
Josie: Correct.
Rhi: So this is gonna be desperate.
Josie: Uh-huh. I get XP. [laugh]
Rhi: Yeah, mark yourself some experience.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Devil’s Bargain?
Josie: Yeah. What does that look like?
Rhi: As you were talking with the guard, Elstera Avrathi comes down from the second floor. She hasn’t seen you yet, but she is here. That’s the Devil’s Bargain I’ll offer you.
Josie: I like it. I’ll take it.
Rhi: All right.
Madge: We are all going to die.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Josie: Yes!
Rhi: You got a 6.
Josie: That’s fucking four 6s.
Rhi: You glance over and see her come down the stairs, and you’re like, “oh, shit.” Then the lock gives, and you ease yourself inside. You find yourself in an office. It actually looks fairly similar to the little office that you were brought into when you first went through the whole membership thing. There’s a desk; there’s a couple very plush chairs in front of the desk; there’s some nice paintings and stuff on the walls; there is another door opposite the desk.
As you’re standing here looking around, you remember that the first time you came to The Centuralia Club and just asked some questions, the guard told you that there was an elite membership level, that that was the only way to get access to the third floor.
Josie: All right. I’m gonna take my time looking for the office; perhaps find a premium membership token before I figure out whose office this is.
Rhi: Gimme some kind of roll for casing the room.
Josie: 5. So, partial.
Rhi: Okay. There’s not a lot of paperwork in here. It doesn’t necessarily seem to belong to anybody in particular. You do find a drawer that contains… They look almost like velvet-covered boxes that you get jewelry in. When you take one of those out and open it up, that contains a medallion that looks very similar to the one that you have, but it is plated in platinum, as opposed to gold and silver. So, you’re like, “oh, yeah, that’s probably the premium membership thing.”
You find that and, I assume, slip it into a pocket, because god damnit, Duskwall might be a corrupt, blighted, darkness-plunged hellscape, but the dresses. Have. Pockets.
Josie: Yup. [laugh]
Madge: Good. Good, good.
Rhi: You slip that into your pocket. As you do that and close the drawer, you hear voices on the other side of the door that you came through. One of the voices is Avrathi. Then you hear what sounds like the jangling of keys.
Josie: Oh dear. Um, okay.
Rhi: So you are now in a risky position. The exit points that you can see are the door that you came in, and then there’s another door that’s opposite the desk.
Josie: Let’s go for it.
Rhi: Okay. It is locked.
Josie: Uh, let’s pick it.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I am gonna go ahead and push myself here. 5s.
Rhi: I think both of the doors unlock at the same time.
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: You get your door open and step inside, but Avrathi sees somebody going up the stairs.
Rhi (as Avrathi): What– who– stop! Who—
Josie: I’m gonna, of course, shut the door behind me.
Rhi: Door slams, and Minx sprints up the stairs into who knows what.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall and, as always, thank you for joining us—and, if you’ve done so, for rating and reviewing our show. We’re so happy to have you with us as we crash headlong towards the end of Season One.
International Podcast Month just wrapped up, and if you haven’t yet, go check out the archives. There are so many fantastic actual plays, audio dramas, and blog posts to dive into. It was a great event to be part of and I’m already excited for next year. Also, I will be at AcadeCon in Dayton, Ohio next month. If you’re going, let me know. I’d love to meet our listeners and hand out more cool Magpies bookmarks.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity. Assata’s Daughters is a Chicago organization that supports, serves, and uplifts women-identified young black people. The group provides education to black girls and women in radical black feminism, political organization, and liberation. They offer educational programs and workshops, organize protests and resistance actions, and maintain a community garden for the neighborhood. If you can spare a few dollars, consider donating.
In addition, there is now just over a month until the 2018 midterm elections here in the United States. While early polling predicts strong Democratic victories, those polls are meaningless unless people register and show up to vote. Double check your registration and be prepared to push back against voter suppression at the polls. Educate yourself on your voting rights and encourage everyone you know to register and vote. If the Democrats can take control of both Houses of Congress, that will be a major check on the hateful and fatal policies of the Trump administration and the Republican party. So please, make sure you’re registered, and make a plan to vote. And as always, please continue to visit 5calls.org and call your representatives.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## [00:02:10]
Rhi: So previously, the Magpies had infiltrated The Centuralia Club looking for evidence that would connect the club’s missing servants to the Circle of Flame. Minx had scouted the ground floor and public areas, living her dream of finally getting into the club and being somewhat confronted with the kinds of people who get into that club. She found the elite membership office and also found that Ambassador Avrathi was present at the club and has very nearly crossed paths with her.
Meanwhile, Myra and Phin have found their way to the kitchen where they have just grabbed a servant, who was in the process of being fired for stealing food from the garbage, and fled into the cellar. This looks like it’s storage for the club. There are wine racks, barrels, and boxes of food. There’s shelves that have like towels and bed linens; there’s a big case of candles. That’s what you see as you move into this room. It’s low-ceilinged; fairly well-lit. The girl that you hauled down here, she’s still crying a little bit.
Minna: I think Myra pulls out a handkerchief and offers it to her.
Rhi: She takes it.
Rhi (as Servant Girl): Oh, um, thank you.
Rhi: And wipes at her eyes.
Rhi (as Servant Girl): Who, uh, who are you?
Madge (as Phin): Uh, we’re people who are here to help. That’s the simple answer.
Rhi (as Servant Girl): Um… okay.
Rhi: She still just looks very confused.
Minna (as Myra): The more complicated answer is it’s gonna be a little bit before we can get you out of here, but I promise, we’ll get you out of here safe.
Madge (as Phin): Before we go any further, can I ask you a couple questions? It won’t be about what happened tonight.
Rhi (as Servant Girl): A-a-alright.
Madge (as Phin): Okay. Lately, some people have been going missing from the club. Do you know any of these people who have gone missing?
Rhi: She nods a little bit.
Rhi (as Servant Girl): There was Benedict, he, uh, he went missing about a month ago. He was always nice to me. He-he helped me out when I first started here. He disappeared, um, and there have been a few others. I-I don’t know.
Madge (as Phin): Okay. Before he went missing, did anything happen in the club? Was there someone who spoke to him? Someone who spoke to other people before they went missing as well?
Rhi (as Servant Girl): [stammering] There’s a lot of, you know, very wealthy people here, and um, I don’t know what happened with Benedict, but there was another girl, Nina. She, um, I saw here talking to, um, Mr. Brogan, who owns the club. I overheard he said that, um, he said that they needed help on the third floor and that she could make really good tips helping up there. And so, they went into the office and I haven’t seen her since.
Minna (as Myra): What’s the third floor?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, who was staying on the third floor?
Rhi (as Servant Girl): Uh, that’s the elite members. They have to pay more and have to be specially invited by the people who own the club to be allowed to go up there.
Minna (as Myra): Would someone like Ambassador Avrathi be important enough to be there?
Rhi (as Servant Girl): Yes, I think so. I think I have seen her. She’s, um, I think she’s here tonight, actually.
Minna: Myra cuts a quick look at Phin.
Madge (as Phin): Okay, so, first things first, it’s a good thing that we got you away from the action. I know that the guy just fired you, but, um… bad stuff is gonna happen tonight; I can promise that, basically. But, thank you for your help. We’ll be able to help you get outta here by the end of the night and we’ll even help you find a new place to work. How does that sound?
Rhi (as Servant Girl): What… I… Why are you doing this?
Madge (as Phin): Because I’m a nice person, that’s why! People help people.
Rhi (as Servant Girl): Not around here, and not, well…
Rhi: And she gestures at herself, where she’s very obviously a Skovlander. She’s got red hair done back in a knot, and a lot of freckles, and very pale.
Minna (as Myra): You deserve better.
Madge (as Phin): Well, Magpies. Magpies are great people to hang out with ‘cause they won’t judge you like that. Anyway…
Rhi (as Servant Girl): Okay, um, alright. I don’t know what your plan is for getting out of here because, um, there’s no other exit out of this room.
Madge (as Phin): [whispering] Shit.
All: [laughter]
Madge: I feel like that’s a good cutaway point!
## [00:07:02]
Rhi: I think on that, yeah, we cut back to Minx running up the stairs. You hit the door at the top and burst out into a lounge. It’s a larger version of the lounge rooms you saw downstairs. There’s only a handful of people up here, they’re all draped over couches and whatever. You’re breathing a little hard, so you get a nice big lungful of the smoke that’s filling the air in here.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: If you would like to resist that pleasant intoxication…
Josie: Uh… I think I don’t want to take that stress.
Rhi: Yeah ‘cause you’re getting pretty high up in stress there, aren’t ya?
Josie: Yeah, I think rather than getting stressed out I should totally just—
Madge: I was not gonna take any harm… But then I got high.
[laughter]
Rhi: So you’re gonna take level 1 harm: Intoxicated.
Josie: So that does fill up both my level 1.
Rhi: You run into the room and you like stumble a little bit, and everything sort of goes soft focus and slows down a little bit. People are looking over at you, but they’re all way too high to care about the fact that somebody just ran into the room.
Josie: Yeah, and now I’m starting to chill out, so…
Rhi: Yeah, part of you is just kind of like, “Oh, okay, this is nice.” There’s another part of you, though, that hears footsteps running up the stairs behind you.
Josie: Can I just, like, step to the side of the door and ready to throw trance powder at whoever opens it? So they’re gonna get a face full of that and the smoke.
Rhi: Mm-hmm, yep.
Josie: So, I’ll just chill.
Rhi: Ok, yeah, so you don’t have to wait very long. The guard from downstairs bursts into the room, and give me a roll to blow it into his face, or however you deliver it.
Josie: Since it’s relatively close range and it’s kind of like, I don’t know, would Skirmish count here?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Ok. That’s not good, that’s a 3.
Rhi: The door opens and the guy comes in. You go to blow the powder in his face, but it feels kind of like you’re moving through water. Everything is really slowed down, so by the time you blow the powder at him, he’s already moved out of the way.
Josie: High as balls. Ok.
Rhi: He’s pulled up a bandana—or, a bandana, a scarf up over his face, covering his nose and mouth. He doesn’t seem to be really affected by the smoke. He grabs you by the arms, spins you around, slams you into a wall, and basically has you pinned in a desperate situation.
Josie (as Minx): Yo, what’s going on? Why are you trying to harsh my buzz, man? Who fucking died?
Rhi (as Guard): You broke in here. You… You do not have permission to be in here!
Josie (as Minx): The fuck are you talking about? I’ve been up– I’ve been up here for like, an hour? It’s probably been an hour.
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Josie: Can I also present the token?
Rhi: Yeah, you can show him the token. This is desperate. Showing him the token, it’ll give you improved effect, so you’re at standard effect rather than lesser, which is what you would have been at otherwise.
Josie: And this has gotta be a Sway.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: ‘Cause I’m leaning into the whole high thing. [rolling] Oh come on!
Rhi: Oooooh boy.
Josie: God damnit.
Rhi: Well, you know, this is to balance out those three 6’s you got earlier.
Josie: Yep. Uh-huh.
Rhi: So, he snatches the thing from your hand.
Rhi (as Guard): You’re a thief.
Rhi: He pockets it and keeps your hands pinned behind your back, and is basically frog-marching you out of the room and back down the stairs. You get down there. Avrathi is leaning against the desk, eyes narrowed as you come down. He brings you over to the middle of the room. She pushes up off the desk, and gets real close at your face and peers at you.
Rhi (as Avrathi): Ah, you were… Yes, I remember you. You were the distraction at the embassy, weren’t you?
Josie (as Minx): I think of myself as a bit more dignified than a distraction, ma’am.
Rhi (as Avrathi): Mmm, yes, I’m sure you do. Well… [sighing] You weren’t up there for terribly long, so the smoke shouldn’t contaminate anything. Bring her!
Rhi: She goes around behind the desk, shifts one of the paintings to the side, and presses at the panel. Then, a couple of the panels pop open, revealing a secret door and a flight of stairs leading down.
Josie: [chuckling] Oh, God dammit. I totally missed that.
Madge: Aw man!
Rhi: She leads the way downstairs…
Josie (as Minx): I should point out that this is highly improper treatment for a paying patron.
Rhi: She doesn’t even respond.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: She leads you down the stairs into a small stone hallway, and then through a door into a room with three stone walls, and one wall that is sort of metal plates. There’s a stone slab in the middle—
Madge: [gasp]
Minna: [gasp] Oh no!
Rhi: With some runes painted on it.
Josie: [horrified noise]
Rhi: She looks at the guard and gestures at the slab. He starts pulling you towards it. And that’s where we’re going to cut back over to the others!
Josie: Okay.
Madge: Aaaah!
## [00:12:29]
Rhi: The girl has just told you there’s no other way out of here. And yeah, what are you doing at this point?
Minna: Myra looks around wildly, then turns to her.
Minna (as Myra): What’s your name?
Rhi (as Servant Girl): Uh, S-Sophia.
Minna (as Myra): Sophia, maybe you can help us out. Do you know how we would get below this building?
Rhi (as Sophia): We are below the building. This is the basement. Um…
Minna (as Myra): This is definitely not the only place below the building.
Rhi (as Sophia): Um.. I don’t, I don’t know. Um…
Minna (as Myra): It’s fine.
Rhi (as Sophia): I mean, this area used to be a bit larger. Um, they… They added in this wall.
Rhi: She points at the back wall, where you see a wall that is made of steel plates riveted together. She’s like.
Rhi (as Sophia): The, um, the storage area used to be a lot bigger. But I guess about a year ago, maybe a little longer, um, they—
Minna (as Myra): Oh, I know exactly what’s on the other side.
Minna: I think at this point, Myra’s cursing quitely under her breath.
Minna (as Myra): There has to be a way in there! We have to be able to find it.
Madge: [nearly inaudible in the background while Minna speaks] Um, explosives would work, right?
Minna: Can she like, think about where they’ve been and how it would connect? Oh, no, go ahead.
Rhi: Yeah?
Madge: Can explos– Can– Explosives, can I have explosives?
Rhi: [happily] Of course you can.
All: [laughter]
Madge: Yesssssss!
All: [more laughter]
Rhi: I was waiting! I was sitting here like, “Come on, Madge, remember the demolition tools.”
Madge: I feel like there’s pacing and swearing and then:
Madge (as Phin): I got it, I got it! One sec, one sec, one sec…
Madge: And it’s her refusing to say anything while she sets this whole thing up. And then we’ll step back and actually light something.
Rhi: Okay. I think while this has been happening, there’s been rattling and pounding at the cellar door, and it sounds like they’re starting to try to break it down.
Madge: Yeah, of course they are.
Rhi: Yeah. But you can wire up a whole bunch of explosives onto the wall and, yeah. Go ahead and, uh, wreck this shit. Do you want to Devil’s Bargain or push yourself, or anything?
Madge: Nope, I’ve got three dice!
Rhi: Okay! I mean, to be fair, so did Josie…
Madge: Shush! Shush, shush, shush!
Rhi: [laugh] This is gonna be risky.
Madge: Okay! 4.
Rhi: 4?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: 4 means you do it.
Madge: I know…
Rhi: But…[chuckling] That could have been a lot worse. But there is a consequence. So—
Minna: I feel like taking harm makes sense.
Rhi: Well, I’m thinking either you take harm, or they break through the door.
Madge: HURT ME!
All: [laughter]
Rhi: All right, if you insist.
Madge: I would rather get hurt than have this girl put in any further danger.
Minna: God bless, that’s the most Phin thing.
Rhi: All right, Phin. Looking at these plates, they look a lot like the hulls of the Leviathan hunter ships. You’ve spent enough time on the docks; you have an idea of how thick and sturdy they are, so you put every explosive that you’ve got on here.
Madge: There’s so much.
Rhi: And you light it. Myra, having worked with you for a while, has pulled Sophia back to the farthest possible corner away from your explosive setup, and is probably like hunkered down behind a barrel. Phin, you light it, you back up; you get maybe about halfway across the room and then it blows. It blows a hole in the wall.
Madge: Heck yeah.
Rhi: A little bit of a hole in the ceiling.
Madge: But, but—
Rhi: And you go flying backwards across the room—
Madge: There we go! [laughter]
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: You slam into the opposite wall. You are studded with shrapnel from the wall, and you slam back into the opposite wall very hard. So, it’s level 2 harm: Exploded, again. Probably fully half of the stuff in this room is just destroyed.
As Myra and Sophia pop their heads up to look out, to see there’s a big hole in the wall. On the other side of it you see a guard, who is sprawled on the floor, also in pretty bad, bloodied-up shape. Ambassador Avrathi, standing at a table on the opposite side, she has one hand on the table to brace herself. In the other hand she’s holding a glass bottle of some kind of silvery liquid.
Minna: Can I shoot the bottle?
Rhi: Yep, in a moment.
Minna: [laughter]
Rhi: Because in the middle of the room is Minx, who is strapped down to the stone slab painted in runes that Blaire had told you about.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, hello dears! I must say, impeccable timing.
## [00:17:37]
Rhi: Now you’re welcome to shoot the bottle
Minna: I would like to shoot the bottle. I would like to push myself.
Rhi: Okay, this is gonna be risky.
Minna: 4.
Rhi: You shoot the bottle, it explodes; there’s glass shards and silvery liquid everywhere. Avrathi shrieks as this glass bottle that she was holding in her hand blows up; her hand is kind of a mess now. The complication is: that door is breaking down. That door behind you.
Minna: Myra is going to give her second pistol to Sophia, just in case she needs it.
Rhi: Sophia takes it and holds it as far out from her as she can, as if she is holding a dead fish.
Josie: [laughter]
Minna (as Myra): Hope you don’t need it.
Rhi (as Sophia): Me too.
Madge: Phin will get up and dust herself off, look over at Avrathi, and lift her chin do the Han Solo thing of, like, “What’s up?” and be like:
Madge (as Phin): Hey, Avrathi.
Josie: [laughter]
Rhi: She never actually saw you. [laughter]
Minna: [laughter]
Madge: I know!
Rhi: So she has no– I know! That’s what makes this so good! She has no idea who the hell you are, but you just blew a hole in her wall. She has her right hand pressed to her chest. You can see blood starting to soak into her shirt. With her left hand, she awkwardly draws a pistol and then yells:
Rhi (as Avrathi): [shocked] Guards!
Rhi: What do you all want to do?
Josie: Uh, I’m tied down.
Rhi: You are tied down.
Josie: So I will provide blithey (sic) commentary. ‘Cause I am high.
Rhi: So what do you all wanna try and do?
Madge: I wanna shoot!
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: No, I’m not gonna shoot, I’m just gonna try and punch!
Josie: Punch girl!
Rhi: I mean, you’re gonna have to sprint across a good deal of room to get to her, but you can do it.
Madge: Yeah, I’m willing to do that. I will say that I’m trying to do as much damage as possible to make it a wreck.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, just slam her back into the desk.
Madge: Yeah. Ahh, I got a 6!
Rhi: She’s squinting at you, trying to figure out who the hell you are, and you just sprint across the room, bull rush her, and slam her back into the desk. She bangs her head against the wall and cries out in pain as this jostles her injured hand. The two of you are struggling over there now, but you definitely have the upper hand for the moment.
Madge: Yeah. I’m gonna grab her good wrist and try to pin it to the desk so she can’t get very far.
Minna: Is there an obvious way to release Minx?
Rhi: They’re leather straps with buckles on them. She’s strapped down. So yeah, you can very easily—
Minna: I’m gonna do that and make sure that Sophia’s between the wall and me.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, she’s following right behind you, very frightened.
Minna: Perfect. Just assume that I’m shielding her with my body at all times.
Rhi: Okay. You start undoing all the straps off of the thing…
Josie (as Minx): Oh, Myra, you do care!
Minna (as Myra): Of course I do, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): Who’s our little friend? You’re adorable.
Rhi: She’s just kind of staring at Minx very wide-eyed, and looking around.
Minna: Myra reaches out and puts a hand on Minx’s forehead to hold her head still, looks into her eyes, and is coming to the assessment—
Rhi: Her pupils are so big. She is just like… [chuckle]
Minna (as Myra): Oh, Minx…
Josie (as Minx): Now– Now be fair! It wasn’t my fault, although I am enjoying myself.
Minna (as Myra): I didn’t believe it was your fault, given that I just found you here.
Rhi: Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, a few more guards have come in and are making their way through the storeroom towards you guys.
Josie: Am I free yet?
Rhi: Yes. Minx is free. While Phin and Avrathi have been struggling over the desk, most of the stuff that was on the desk is now on the floor. There’s some papers; there’s now a lot of broken glass and weird silvery liquid on the floor; there’s a leather-bound tome that has a little bit of gilt edging on it, also fallen on the floor.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna… If stuff was taken off of her at all, like her cane…
Minna: It’d be sitting on that table.
Rhi: Yeah, or like, it’s leaning against a wall, propped up in a corner.
Josie: Yeah, she’s just gonna walk over to it.
Josie (as Minx): You know, normally I wouldn’t argue against a lady tying me down on a Friday evening. But extenuating circumstances, I suppose.
Josie: I now pull the sword out of my cane and I’m almost drunkenly brandishing it at the people coming towards us.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie (as Minx): [laugh] Come now, come now.
Rhi: All right. Myra? And/or Phin.
Minna: I think I’m just gonna grab the papers and book up.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I’m keeping Avrathi on the desk by the arm that I had before. I was just holding it so that she couldn’t move anywhere while pinning her with my other hand. I’m gonna move the other hand. I’m gonna twist it back the way it should not go.
Rhi: That hand, she had a pistol in, so I think you’ve probably bent it back to where she’s dropped it. She’s struggling against you a lot, but she is not a fighter.
Madge: Yeah, and I’m gonna get real close to her face.
Madge (as Phin): You’ve hurt a lot of good people, you know that? In this very room.
Rhi (as Avrathi): It was for things that you can’t possibly understand.
Madge (as Phin): Demonic power?
Rhi (as Avrathi): Power that you would never comprehend. They’re expendable.
Rhi: Phin, in order to keep a hold on her, you’re gonna need to make a roll.
Madge: I’m gonna do a Skirmish.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky.
Madge: Yeah, I’m gonna also push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Cool, 6.
Rhi: Yeah, you keep a hold on her. A couple shots go off, but they miss. The guards seem to be hesitating a little bit. I don’t know if you’re necessarily using her as a human shield, but the positioning is such that they can’t get a clear line on you.
Madge: Yeah. I’m definitely positioning myself so that if they try to shoot me, they will get her.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. So, Myra has a bunch of papers and a book; Minx has a sword and a pretty good high; Phin has Ambassador Avrathi.
Josie: Can I use my drunken waving as a distraction? Surely they can see me stumble a bit and perceive that I’m not really a threat, but can I just be weird and annoying enough to draw their attention for few crucial moments?
Rhi: Sure.
Josie: Basically, I want to give people time to get out of the way of being shot. I might get shot, but—
Rhi: So you’re kind of trying to do like a setup action, basically, for everybody else to run.
Josie: Yes, kind of.
Rhi: Yes, you can definitely be distracting and then, if this works, everybody else who follows through taking advantage of your distraction will get either improved position or a +1 effect.
## [00:24:55]
Josie: I am gonna push myself, though, and get myself up to four dice because I’m positing this as a Sway.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Oh my god.
Josie: Ooh, I’m gonna cry, you guys.
Rhi: That’s amazing. That’s four 1s.
Minna: Oh my god.
Josie: Four 1s, for the listeners.
Rhi: That’s remarkable
Madge: That’s insane.
Rhi: Here’s what happens: you’re stumbling around waving your sword. The guards with the guns don’t seem to be paying a lot of attention to you; they’re still focused on the seeming much more obvious threat of Phin. What you hadn’t been paying attention to is that guard who was on the ground. You stumble over; he lashes out, grabs your ankle, and just pulls your legs out from under you. You go crashing down; you slam your head against the cobblestones; your sword-cane goes rolling out of your hand. You are gonna take level 2 harm: Concussed.
Josie: Gah.
Rhi: He’s kind of struggling upright, looking very bloodied, and is fumbling for his own pistol.
Josie (as Minx): Ow.
Minna: Myra could have left something in the cellar that would surprise these guards.
Josie: Oooh, yeah.
Madge: A rabid dog!
Minna: [laughing] Where would I have put a rabid dog, Madge?
Josie: [laughter]
Madge: I don’t know.
Josie: Can you have more explosives?
Madge: [whispering] Yes!
Minna: I was gonna say, that’s what’s popping into my head.
Madge: Yeah, more explosives would make sense.
Minna: I think that what she does is she reaches out, she grabs Sophia with one hand and Phin with the other, and she says:
Minna (as Myra): Get down.
Rhi: Okay. I’m gonna say that’s a 1-stress flashback. It’s a little trickier to pull off, but not super improbable. So yeah, you pull them back. The guards are starting to move forward and then: poom-poom-poom-poom, a whole bunch of explosions go off. Some of the shelves fall, there’s a lot of confusion and shouting. It creates a very loud momentary distraction.
Madge: Can I use that distraction to grab the gun?
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: I’m gonna pick up the gun that I stole from Avrathi, and I’m gonna keep one hand on her shoulders to keep her pinned to the desk. Then I am gonna look down at her and say:
Madge (as Phin): The only person who’s expendable here is you.
Madge: And I shoot her.
Josie: Yesssss.
Rhi: To– To kill?
Madge: To kill.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, make, uh, make a roll.
Madge: And I’m not caring about how much other damage I cause to the area around her with this.
Rhi: So you’re shooting a lot.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: You’re firing a lot of bullets.
Madge: I’m shooting at least once, but I am not aiming very well. And I’m gonna take another 2 stress to push myself. Two 1s, a 2, and a 3.
Rhi: Wow, that’s… Wow, okay.
Madge: I have her! Right here, and…
Rhi: I think what happens is she knees you in the stomach. It’s not enough where you take harm, but you said you weren’t aiming super well. She manages to get a knee up, knees you in the stomach, you lose your hold. You’ve still got the gun, she’s still pretty badly injured, but she manages to break free of your hold. I think she’s gonna run. She realizes what nearly happened and she is just gonna book it, so she heads towards the doorway and the stairs that Minx was brought through.
Madge: I shoot again.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: This one is gonna be a Hunt, right?
Rhi: And it’s gonna be risky.
Minna: Is there any way to aid that, or is that not a thing?
Rhi: Yeah, absolutely. You can absolutely help her.
Minna: Hey, guess who has a newly-minted special ability to aid without taking stress?
Madge: Yay!
Josie: Nice.
Minna: I think I fire into the wall and she flinches away from it.
Rhi: Yeah, trying to move her into Phin’s aim.
Minna: Over Myra and Phin’s shoulders, you see Myra raise her gun over Phin’s left shoulder and shoots (sic). It hits the wall, chips it, and Avrathi flinches.
Rhi: All right.
Madge: I have my two best dice in my hand right now. I am so nervous.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m nervous for you.
Madge: 5!
Rhi: Okay. She takes off running. Myra shoots her; she flinches to the side. Phin, you catch her square in the back, and she falls, pitches face forward down. How does Phin feel after she falls?
Madge: Phew… Aw man, it isn’t even like a, “Yes, I did it!” It’s more like, “Okay, what’s next?”
Rhi: Okay. You get a moment, and then you get shot in the side by one of the guards.
Madge: Oh no! Okay, uh, what would I roll to resist that?
Rhi: Prowess.
Madge: Prowess, how many things do I have in Prowess? Oh, I have 4 in Prowess. Cool.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: 6.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, then you take no stress. Are you guys gonna do anything else, or are you just gonna run out of here at this point?
Madge: I think, at this point, we run, yeah.
Josie: Well, I imagine it is mostly on the backs of Phin and Myra, as Minx is disoriented in a really bad way.
Minna: I think we’re chivvying Sophia and Minx ahead of us.
Madge: Yeah, and threatening anyone who gets in our way.
Rhi: I’m picturing that there’s a lot of shots; probably, a bullet hits one of those chandeliers and shards just go flying everywhere. There is screaming and panic and chaos, and you all burst out of the front doors of The Centuralia Club—
Minna: As they step through the front door, Myra tosses over her shoulder a Magpie pin.
Madge: Yes! Good, I was—
Rhi: Yesssss!
Josie: Yes!
Madge: I was thinking the exact same thing, I’m not even joking.
## [00:31:05]
Rhi: Myra tosses that pin. The four of you, with this poor servant girl, so confused and frightened, you all go sprinting off into the night. Where do you take Sophia?
Madge: Hound’s Paw.
Rhi: Hound’s Paw?
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Do you guys go straight there?
Josie: Yeah, probably.
Rhi: Okay. You don’t take a direct route—
Madge: Of course not.
Rhi: You take some back alleys. You guys have been doing this long enough, you know how this works. Minx, you’ve mostly come down from your high on the way, which means there is nothing to distract you from the throbbing pain in your head.
Josie: Uh-huh. Minx is completely fucking out of it, and probably goes over to the bar and [laughing] orders a drink when she gets to Rigney’s, even though he’s probably in no position to make her one.
Rhi: I mean, he keeps the bar open pretty late, but I think it’s getting to the point where he’s starting to get ready to close up. You guys stagger in. He looks you over. There really aren’t any other customers in here. He just looks at you, opens the flap, comes over, locks the door, and then just is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): [sighing] Sit down.
Rhi: And disappears into the back. He comes back with a bottle of cheap alcohol and a roll of bandages. He sets them down.
Rhi (as Rigney): I don’t want to know what happened. Uh, patch yourselves up as much as you can.
Rhi: He looks at Sophia.
Rhi (as Rigney): Uh, this is not Blaire.
Madge (as Phin): No, this is Sophia.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire’s at home, safe.
Rhi (as Rigney): Okay.
Minna (as Myra): This girl needed some help.
Josie (as Minx): We have a thing for this, apparently.
Rhi: When Myra says that she needed some help, he just kind of looks at Sophia again, then, looks back at you guys.
Rhi (as Rigney): Are you gonna bring me all your strays?
Minna (as Myra): Not all of them, but this one is a special case.
Madge (as Phin): Can you do me a favor, Rig?
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah… Well, what’s the favor?
Madge (as Phin): Give her a job.
Rhi: He looks over at her. She basically hasn’t said a word since the explosions started. She is curled in on herself, looking terrified. He sees this, walks over, and crouches down so that he’s more at eye level.
Rhi (as Rigney): Where’d you work before this? What were you doing?
Rhi (as Sophia): I, um, I worked at The Centuralia Club.
Rhi: He shoots the three of you a look.
Madge (as Phin): You said you weren’t gonna ask us anything. You stick with that.
Rhi (as Rigney): I… Asked her, which I also now slightly regret.
Josie (as Minx): We lived the dream is what we did, Rigney. We lived the dream.
Rhi (as Rigney): I, yeah, looks… like it. Um…
Rhi: He talks to Sophia a little bit, asks what she did there. She explains.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, I can make room for another server on staff, I suppose.
Rhi: He rubs the back of his neck and is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, come on over to the bar and let me, you know, get some information from you so we can get you added to the schedule.
Rhi: She stands up and looks at the three of you, still very frightened.
Minna (as Myra): The people here are much nicer than at The Centuralia Club.
Madge (as Phin): By a long shot.
Josie (as Minx): Rigney’s just about the nicest person in this damn city.
Rhi: She nods a little bit, and is wringing her hands together:
Rhi (as Sophia): Um, all right, I um, thank you. I still don’t really understand any of what happened here. Um, it’s very… This is not how I expected this night to go, at all, but um… T-Thank you.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, things spiraled. Sorry about the explosions, that was not in the plan. It was a backup measure.
Rhi: She just nods and heads over back to follow Rigney, and leaves the three of you sitting at the table. Myra, do you want to look over those papers that you grabbed?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: The book is a thick, leather-bound, gilded tome. When you open it up, there are pages and pages and pages of notes that are written in different hands. It looks like multiple people were taking notes here, and they start about a year ago.
The notes talk about some kind of drug called “spiritsight,” an entity called “The Fallen Star,” and it seems like The Circle of Flame was using this spiritsight drug. They would drug people and then try to ask those people questions to have them have visions of locating different objects, particularly the relics of Kotar.
Josie: Hmm.
Rhi: They worked through a number of different formulas. They started working better when they started incorporating the ghosts of people who had died while on this drug into the formula. Eventually, it ended up working, and this method located the Eye of Kotar, which was shipped in from Iruvia and stolen by the Magpies. After the Eye was stolen, The Circle decided to speed up their search. They built a second ritual chamber.
The most recent entry is someone complaining that it’s harder to grab new sacrifices because so many of the guards are dead. The final entry says, “Use some of the servants, then. There’s enough people looking for work that we can replace them. They’ll be perfectly acceptable.”
Minna (as Myra): Also, the person who complained about leaving the club unguarded was “H.V.”—Harvale Brogan.
Josie (as Minx): Mm.
Rhi: You’ve got this journal here that basically spells out exactly what happened.
Minna (as Myra): God, I wish we could narrow down who those initials could be. I mean, Avrathi’s probably “E.A.”
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, I was about to say. You’ve got three guesses, the first two don’t count.
Josie (as Minx): [chuckles] But who is—
Minna (as Myra): Who is “E.P.”? And who is “R.”?
Josie (as Minx): No ideas so far.
Madge (as Phin): Probably shouldn’t have shot Avrathi.
Josie (as Minx): Eh, either result is acceptable to me. Good job, Phin.
Josie: Minx is gonna go rest her head on her forearms.
Rhi: As you all are sitting there, there’s suddenly a light knocking at the door. Everybody freezes. Rigney is standing behind at the bar. He looks at it, reaches under the bar, comes up with a blunderbuss, walks over. There’s a window with a curtain over it. He eases the curtain aside and peers out, and then totally relaxes, lowers the gun, opens it up. A rather flustered-looking Lani and Roxanne come hustling in.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, it’s you!
Josie (as Minx): Oh, excellent.
Madge (as Phin): Glad to see you join the party.
Josie (as Minx): We have a scoop for you.
## [00:37:47]
Rhi: Roxanne is translating what you’re saying and Lani signs back:
Rhi (as Lani): We heard the alarm bells going and the death bell, and we heard pretty quickly about some kind of attack at The Centuralia Club, and… Well.
Rhi: She shrugs. They grab a couple chairs and come over.
Rhi (as Lani): So, what did you find?
Minna: I think Myra just gestures to this book that’s laid out here.
Rhi: They take it and flip through it. There’s a lot of facial expressions that grow increasingly more troubled and alarmed. And then, when they get to the last entry, Lani’s mouth goes into a thin line. She pushes back from the table and makes a sign that Minx recognizes is a very rude word.
Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: Roxanne still has both her hands on the journal.
Rhi (as Roxanne): This… This is more than we could have asked for. Can we take this? We need to get started.
Minna (as Myra): Do you have any speculation on those others? I mean, we can guess on two of the sets of initials.
Rhi (as Roxanne): It’s most likely Harvale and Avrathi… “E.P….” Yeah, ”E.P.” and “R….”
Minna (as Myra): Let us know if you figure them out. They’ll be people to watch out for.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Yes, we’ll absolutely look into it.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. You’re gonna need to question Harvale about it. Not Avrathi.
Rhi: Roxanne and Lani both look at you for a moment, and then Lani nods. It looks like they’re both making the very unusual decision for them to not ask any more questions.
Minna: They can make a pretty easy guess.
Rhi: Yeah, Roxanne closes the book and tucks it into her bag.
Rhi (as Roxanne): You all should rest up. You look like you had a very difficult time getting this. We’re sorry to have put you all through this. But we’ll be in touch. We’ll definitely look into those other names and see what we can find out.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: They head out. Rigney, when he sees them leaving, walks them out and locks the door again. He gets Sophia taken care of, put on the schedule, probably gives her a shot to calm her nerves. He tells you guys that he’ll get his buddies in the Cabbies to take her home, make sure that she gets back safely.
Once you all are rested up enough where you feel like you can start heading back home, you get up and make your way back through the streets. You’re all tired and hurting and battered, but you made it. You helped someone and eliminated somebody who was involved in a lot of very terrible things.
You get back to The Nest. Blaire is asleep when you get in. You all crawl into bed, manage to get to sleep. For some of you, it takes longer than others.
You’re all awakened shortly before dawn by the sound of bells tolling throughout the city. Several sets of bells are high-pitched and frantic, and you recognize that. That’s the alarm of The Brigade, which are the firefighters of Duskwall. The other bell is a low, constant, steady toll of the death bell ringing out over and over. You all get up, head to the windows, looking out, trying to figure out what’s going on. As you all look towards the northwest in the city, you find your way to those windows. You see, lighting up the sky, a massive fire in the middle of the docks district.
Minna: Ah! Oh no!
Madge: [whispering] Oh no.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. This is the end of Season 1. Those of you who have been listening to The Magpies from the beginning or at least from pretty close to it might remember that the first few episodes originally went up without a season in the title. That’s because I didn’t know if there were going to be seasons. I had no idea how long this would last or if anyone would even listen, so the fact that I’m getting ready to post the Season 1 finale with several episodes of Season 2 already edited is amazing. I am so grateful to my players, my friends, and to all of you. Thank you so, so much for listening. This might be the end of the first season, but we’re just getting started. We have so much more story to tell.
A quick note about today’s episode. You might notice that there is an NPC whose name randomly switches. This is because we messed up and forgot her name… and renamed her. [smiling] For purposes of canon the second name is the one that we’re going with. Sorry if this causes any confusion.
Some other announcements: First, tune into the Roll For Change stream on October 20th. They are doing a charity stream to support the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and I am going to be GM-ing a spooky, pre-Halloween game of Blades. Minna will be joining me as will friend of the show and guest star Waffles along with a couple of new players. Our stream will be starting at about 3 PM Central Time. Tune in, and if you can donate please do. I’ll put links in the show notes.
And, I am still going to AcadeCon next month. Look me up if you’re there, get a bookmark, and maybe we’ll play some games together.
Also next month, on November 15th, check out Minna and Madge in a new podcast: Iron Hides, hosted on the One Shot network. It’s a weird west actual play podcast using the Monster of the Week system. They’ve got a great cast, and you should definitely give them a listen when the show goes live.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity. Assata’s Daughters is a Chicago organization that supports, serves, and uplifts women-identified young Black people. The group provides education to Black girls and women in radical Black feminism, political organization, and liberation. They offer educational programs and workshops, organize protests and resistance actions, and maintain a community garden for the neighborhood. If you can spare a few dollars consider donating.
Election Day is fast approaching in the US, so please make a plan to vote. Check your registration to make sure you stay registered and when you can take action against voter suppression in your area. Voting isn’t the only thing we can or should do to fight back against the horrible things that are happening in our government, but it’s an important thing, so make sure that you and as many people as you can drag along with you are able to get to the polls.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:03:04]
Rhi: We open basically where we left off last time with this massive fire burning in the middle of The Docks right around the Ink Row district where newspapers and tattoo parlors and apartments and other businesses are all crowded together. We see this massive fire consuming buildings. There is a huge crowd of people in the street being held back by a line of Bluecoats. The wagons of The Brigade are rushing back and forth from the fire to the canals carrying water to try and get the fire contained.
Duskwall is a very crowded city, there’s not a lot of space between buildings, and a fire like this if it’s not controlled quickly could very easily spread and take out an entire district, and if it jumps any of the canals then it could put the entire city in danger, so there’s a lot of very frantic activity trying to get this blaze under control.
We see The Magpies having all just rolled out of bed and rushed over here at the edge of the crowd. What are you doing as you get there?
Madge: [deep exhale]
Josie: I think we need to look for our reporter friends. Yeah?
Minna: Yeah. I think we’re looking for them.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, you’re looking around, you’re calling for them. A few minutes go by without seeing or hearing anything, and then you hear:
Rhi (as Roxanne): Minx?! Minx, is that you?!
Rhi: You look to see standing kind of at one of the edges of the crowd is Roxanne, who waves at you to get your attention. As you head over you see Lani is beside her. Both of them look like they kind of did the same thing you did of just rolled out of bed and came over here. They just have coats and shoes thrown on over night gowns. Roxanne’s hair which is normally done back in a braid is super fluffed out from sleep. Lani does not look at you guys, doesn’t seem to be aware that you’re there, she is just staring at this fire with a look of…
Kim & Josie: Aw…
Rhi: It’s that expressionless look when somebody is so pushed into shock and grief that they just kind of shut down.
Josie: Oh gosh, no.
Rhi: As you all get over:
Rhi (as Roxanne): [exasperated] I’m glad to see all of you, but what are you doing here? Were you over here, or-?
Minna (as Myra): We were woken by the bells. We were afraid that you might be hurt.
Rhi (as Roxanne): No, we… [exhales]
Rhi: And she just closes her eyes for a moment.
Rhi (as Roxanne): We did come back to the offices for a while after we got the journal that you stole, and we were working on it and putting notes together, and then we went home a few hours ago. You know, we had a rule that work, work didn’t come home with us. We never brought anything home.
Josie (as Minx): Well, regardless dears, we’re just glad that you two are okay.
Rhi (as Roxanne): I mean, if we stayed a couple hours longer…
Rhi: You all have noticed at this point that Lani is not facing any of you, but Roxanne is still signing everything that she and you all are saying seemingly just kind of out of habit.
Josie & Minna: [sad squirming groans]
Rhi: She just looks up at all of you with this grief in her eyes.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Everything was there, everything we had on The Circle.
Josie (as Minx): Those things can be replaced. I think the most important things were not there.
Kim (as Blaire): No, they can’t, Minx.
Madge: Oh-
Minna (as Myra): I hope nobody else got hurt in the fire.
Rhi: Roxanne shakes her head.
Rhi (as Roxanne): I’m pretty sure that not everybody made it out, the way that these places are built and packed in here.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re sorry we roped you into this.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Tch, we roped you. Remember? We came to you those months ago asking for help.
Minna (as Myra): Well, it’s our problem now too.
Rhi (as Roxanne): I guess so.
Rhi: I think on that we sort of fade out, and fade back in on the front page of the Doskvol Daily which is dated about three days after the fire. We have a few headlines on the page. One of them is talking about resources for people displaced by the fire. Another headline says that the manhunt for The magpies for the assassination of Ambassador Avrathi continues.
Minna: [seethes] Oh, the “assassination,” because she’s an ambassador, Jesus Christ, and we did it at a high security club.
Rhi: You’re on the front page, but you are not the top headline anymore.
Madge: That’s good.
Rhi: Because the top headline now reads: “City Council Plans Reconstruction for Ink Row, by Anita Argent, Staff Reporter.
Following the catastrophic inferno that consumed numerous residences, businesses, and tragically the offices of The North Hook Mirror, the City Council has moved swiftly to aid the displaced citizens. Nearly 300 people have lost their homes in the wake of the blaze, and as of this printing over 90 are still missing and presumed deceased. Fearing a massive spirit outbreak The Spirit Wardens have maintained vigil over the site for days fending off unscrupulous and vile whispers and spirit traffickers who would unleash the ghosts upon Duskwall, but even in the wake of such tragedy the citizens of The Docks have something to look forward to.
The City Council, led by Lady Eleanor Penderyn, has approved to Lord Alistair Mora’s bid to purchase the destroyed blocks, and the Daily has gained exclusive information about his plans. Lord Mora intends to build a modern weapons factory on the site along with worker housing…
Josie (as Minx): What?! [exhales]
Rhi: …providing jobs and residences for the displaced citizens. By building the factory on The Docks, imported materials and exported goods can be moved and sold at greater speeds. He and the City Council hope that the factory will be the first of many changes coming to the struggling district.”
Josie (as Minx): Have they no shame?
Rhi: Beside the article is an artist’s sketch of the planned development. It’s a three-story factory that takes up about two thirds of the space, and then kind of wedged in behind it is a tall, narrow tenement building. Where do we find you all reading this article?
Kim: I’d like to think we’re all sitting at our table at The Hound’s Paw.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: How are we reacting to this?
Madge: [quickly] Not great! [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Minna: [emphatically] Not great at all.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Minx hasn’t done herself up all that much, she’s wearing pretty plain clothes, her hair is down, and for a very rare occasion looking just kind of like a normal person.
Rhi: In particular, how is Phin reacting to this news?
Josie: Yeah?
Madge: [laughs] Basically from the moment that she glances at Lord Mora’s name on the page she has just been up and pacing back and forth, basically across the whole length of The Hounds Paw and just not stopping, and is trying to keep composed and it’s definitely barely working.
Minna (as Myra): Phin?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah?
Minna (as Myra): Is it just what it is that they’re planning?
Madge (as Phin): Nope. Nope, no, nope, no.
Minna (as Myra): Do you wanna talk about it?
Madge (as Phin): So, before I was in this with you… Chael and I, we did some stuff back on The Docks, because there was a gang that had been hired by a noble to basically extort people and take their money and make sure that no one could basically do anything other than live in terror. It took ages, and we barely pushed them out. Lord Mora is the one who hired them, and I’m thinking he’s gonna… Whatever he’s gonna do with this weapons factory it is not gonna be good. He’s not gonna treat those people well, the ones that are gonna be working there, at the tenement building, it’s gonna be a nightmare.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed, and this development is rather unsubtle about that.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Phin, I’m sorry. [sighs] He has to have been involved in the fire, surely. He’s profiting off it anyway.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): I can’t think that they would throw something up that quickly if they hadn’t planned on it.
Kim (as Blaire): The Circle of Flame did it. He’s just throwing gasoline on it.
Josie (as Minx): Or he’s a member.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, that too. I don’t know.
Madge (as Phin): The fact that he’s involved makes this a whole lot more personal than it was before.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t even know where to start with confronting this.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, we have a name and something we want to prevent. At the very least we have a target.
Kim (as Blaire): Is that a good idea? Don’t you think we should lay low right now?
Madge (as Phin): You guys are free to lay low if you want, but I’m not gonna sit back while this happens.
Josie (as Minx): How many more people are gonna get hurt while we lick our wounds?
Minna (as Myra): We’re part of this whether we want to be or not. We helped light that match. We got mixed up in it, and now it’s getting bigger than we expected.
Kim (as Blaire): So how do we stop it?
Madge (as Phin): My first instinct is just to kill Lord Mora, but I Know…
Minna (as Myra): That won’t end it. That’s cutting off one head. Two more will grow back in its place.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Then we make it impossible to start building anything there.
Minna (as Myra): Sabotage the spot.
Madge (as Phin): Sabotage the spot, get people to start fighting back against Lord Mora and the City Council in that area specifically.
Minna (as Myra): How did you get rid of the gang back on The Docks?
Madge (as Phin): Chael and I got together a group of kids like us who were sick of being pushed around and started fighting back.
Minna (as Myra): So we do that?
Madge (as Phin): We do that.
Rhi: It’s sounding like we’re wanting to move into gathering info and starting to figure out a plan of attack here?
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: Are we sabotaging the site or gathering people? What is happening here?
Kim: It sounded like both. [laughs]
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It’s possible that you could find ways to sabotage it where it would be possible to be reclaimed and rebuilt.
Minna: Just get people to squat on it forever. [laughs]
Rhi: The other issue is that right now the area is basically under complete lockdown by both The Bluecoats and The Spirit Wardens, because according to estimates at least 90 people died.
Kim: That’s 90 angry ghosts.
Rhi: Yeah, probably more than that with the way that these kind of estimates tend to shake out. So, The Spirit Wardens are on the highest of high alert because that would be a massive spirit outbreak there.
Minna: [laughing] I think Myra’s going to sit up.
Minna (as Myra): Hear me out. I know this probably isn’t the easiest or best idea. You said, Phin, that you had success with getting people to band together.
Madge (as Phin): Mm-hmm.
Minna (as Myra): Right now a big worry there is the 90-some folks who died in the fire. I think we’ve got a lot of anger there that if we could harness, if we could get them on our side…
Kim (as Blaire): [long gasp] A ghost riot?!
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear.
Madge (as Phin): What?
Kim (as Blaire): [shouts] Ghost riot!
Kim: She raises her arms, and I think the entire bar just kind of goes quiet. [laughs] You hear a fork clank.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: [laughing] Oh my God.
Rhi: Rigney is at the bar and just puts a hand to his face and shakes his head.
Kim: [giggles]
Madge (as Phin): Let’s not scream ghost riot in the middle of a crowded bar.
Kim (as Blaire): Sorry!
Madge (as Phin): How about we not do that right now at this very second?
Kim (as Blaire): Okay! I’m sorry!
Madge (as Phin): It’s fine. You didn’t know.
Kim (as Blaire): I got excited.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, I know you got excited.
Josie (as Minx): Being said, as unsavory as the prospect is, it is a smart plan I think. Surely it can’t be worse than our experiences in The Lost District.
Rhi: Oh God. Why would you tempt me like that? I mean—
[laughter]
Madge: Phin raises a finger to be like, “ah!” and then just closes her mouth in a thin line and takes a long sip of her drink. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Well, it sounds like Myra and Blaire would be the experts in this situation. I say just tell us what we need to find out.
Kim (as Blaire): If I can convince as many ghosts as I can, and maybe if I also bring my own, I think we can do this.
Madge (as Phin): Question.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm?
Madge (as Phin): How many ghosts do you have?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Kim: She starts counting on her fingers.
Rhi: [laughs] Oh my God!
Kim: [laughs] She pauses for a second.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! No, not that one.
Kim: Then she backtracks, counts again.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… At least eight.
Rhi: Oh my God! [laughs]
Madge (as Phin): [angry] Have you been keeping those in our home?
Kim (as Blaire): In jars, yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire…
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm?
Josie (as Minx): Remember how Myra and the rest of us said no ghosts in the house?
Kim (as Blaire): But they’re in my room in jars! It’s fine!
Minna (as Myra): These are the ones you pick up and plan to set loose?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! The ones in my room. You know, because nobody’s allowed in my room. It’s fine.
Madge (as Phin): Oh my gods.
Josie (as Minx): Well, you think you can convince them to help?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm!
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, correct me if I’m wrong.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah?
Minna (as Myra): Spirits, they need energy. Correct?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): If they don’t take it off the living they take it from … spirit wells? Are there other sources of energy?
Kim: I think that Blaire visits The Deathlands rather regularly to set her collection free. She kind of has a rotating collection of guests that she keeps. When she isn’t able to go to The Deathlands, I imagine there has to be some way she can maybe just harvest a little bit from the spirit well in maybe like an ectoplasmic form, and she’s very good at feeding them.
Rhi: If that is Blaire’s solution when she can’t get out to The Deathlands, that means Blaire knows where there’s a spirit well in the city.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… Yeah!
Minna (as Myra): I mean, I was suggesting that if we want spirits on our side and relatively not likely to possess us, I would hope that we have some means of feeding them that will keep them satisfied.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): It may even be a bargaining chip.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, we could try. What I was proposing was that we would go over to Ink Row, and I would release some of my own spirits—because they know me, they’re friends, and they trust me—and they would probably help us gather around the spirits that are already there to, you know, start a ghost riot.
Josie (as Minx): All right…
Minna (as Myra): Long term, what happens with them? That’s the question I have.
Kim (as Blaire): What if—Idea! Idea! What if, after the riot was quote unquote “done,” I don’t know how long riots take, I’ve never participated in one, but when it’s done we could lead them all over to the spirit well and they could just hang out there until however long. You know, they could just hop in there and they might be able to find their way around.
Madge (as Phin): Okay…
Kim (as Blaire): They’re smart.
Minna (as Myra): They can go through spirit wells?
Kim: Mm-hmm! They’re like fabrics of space and time and reality, so they just like dive in there.
Minna (as Myra): Huh? I didn’t know that.
Kim (as Blaire): I wouldn’t suggest going down there yourself, though. That’d be bad news.
Minna (as Myra): I wasn’t aware that’s what spirit wells were. I just knew they could maybe feed ghosts.
Kim (as Blaire): Well yeah, but… It’s kind of more like shoving your face into an all you can eat buffet kind of thing, only theirs is like literally bottomless. You know?
Minna (as Myra): [laughing] I’m imagining an all you can eat buffet that becomes a tunnel.
Kim (as Blaire): [smiling] Yeah, that’s it! You got it!
Rhi: [laughing] Oh my God.
Minna (as Myra): That’s certainly an interesting metaphor. Thank you for that.
[laughter]
Rhi: So, a question that I’m gonna put out here: What is the target for the riot? What is the end goal of the riot?
Kim: Drive away The Bluecoats and The Spirit Wardens.
Rhi: And try to get the people who lived there previously to reoccupy the space?
Kim: Exactly.
Josie: Yes.
Minna: Yeah, so my suggestion was gonna be that we keep the ghost thing going at least long enough for some squatters to get in there and fully establish themselves.
Kim (as Blaire): We let the riot play out as long as it needs to, and then I can lead them to the nearest spirit well.
Josie (as Minx): And then in the meantime we whip up some of the populous to move back in once the ghosts move out.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah!
Madge (as Phin): It could work.
Kim (as Blaire): Honestly, this sounds perfect.
Minna (as Myra): So it sounds like a two-pronged plan.
Madge (as Phin): Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): It sounds like Blaire and Myra should probably handle the ghost side of things, and then Phin and I handle the mortal side of things?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Phin, are you comfortable with that?
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, yeah.
Minna (as Myra): All right.
Josie: Are we doing some Gather Informations?
Rhi: I believe we are. Let’s start with Team Mortals.
Josie: All right.
## Team Mortals, Josie & Phin [0:20:25]
Rhi: I think a lot of the people who got displaced have ended up in Charhollow. Yeah. Charhollow is where Myra is from. It’s, you know…
Minna: Poor but honest.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s working class, but there’s a very strong community there, so I think that is the kind of place that would actually be willing to take in the displaced people of The Docks, and even if they weren’t willing they do not have the ability to sort of resist the city being like “these people are here now.” I think it’s literally just after the fire they just sort of moved everybody through Crow’s Foot down into Charhollow like “Alright, here you go, good luck.”
Josie: Womp.
Rhi: So I think where a lot of people have ended up is Charhollow Market, which is typically a public market that kind of occupies a large open square. Craftspeople who live in the area will sell things to the community. The market has basically shut down, because you just have 100-150 people who have staked out little corners of the square with families and whatever few belongings they were able to save. There’s a number of representatives from The Weeping Lady kind of moving through the crowd. The Weeping Lady is a charity, sort of religion, kinda-sorta not really. It honors the First Lord Governor of Duskwall, Lady Devera, who is said to have been a champion of the poor, so this is an organization that you know has some soup kitchens and a handful of shelters and things like that. They are in no way sufficiently funded or supplied to deal with a crisis of this scale, but they are doing their best.
There’s also a handful of people who are just kind of from the area who are trying to help out as much as they can, but it’s a pretty crowded, miserable scene of people who have just lost everything and don’t really have anywhere to go. That is what Phin and Minx come upon as they reach this spot in the district.
Josie: That gives me an idea.
Madge: What’s your plan?
Josie: I guess my gather info / setup thing is to figure out how much it would cost to get good humanitarian efforts into the area.
Rhi: Are you thinking just in terms of kind of taking care of the people immediately, or what you would need to do to…
Josie: So that if they moved back into their burnt out districts they can actually, you know, stay there. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. Phin, what is your plan here?
Madge: I’m gonna try and talk with some of the people who are actually, who used to live in the district… you know, on the block, to try and get information.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay. Let’s start with Minx. You’re just gonna approach. Older man, looks like he’s probably late 50s early 60s, mostly bald, hunched posture. I think that for The Weeping Lady they all sort of have an emblem or patch type thing that they wear somewhere on their clothing, so he has one just on his chest, and as you approach he looks over and squints at you a little bit. You look too well dressed and energetic to be one of the—
Josie: Well, I am dressing down still, technically.
Rhi: Even so. [laughs]
Josie: This is Minx we’re talking about. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Even if Minx is wearing clothes appropriate to Charhollow you still look better off than the refugees.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: He kind of squints at you.
Rhi (as Older Man): Um… Can I help you with something?
Josie (as Minx): It’s more that I wish to help you. Yes.
Rhi: When you say that he brightens.
Rhi (as Older Man): Oh! Uh… Yes, help would be wonderful.
Rhi: I think at this point you should make your roll. We’ll see how this conversation plays out.
Josie: Yeah. That’s a 2, a 3, and a 1.
Rhi: Oof.
Kim: Oh boy.
Rhi: So, you offer help… This man kind of straightens up and looks very pleased.
Rhi (as Older Man): Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
Rhi: He takes you by the arm and leads you over towards a wagon loaded with the most basic of rations, like mushroom flour bread and dried seaweed. He starts loading a basket.
Rhi (as Older Man): If you can help distribute this to the families on the east side that would be wonderful.
Rhi: You can ask a few questions while he’s loading this basket up, but you’re gonna get limited information.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, I suppose that’s no problem. Although, I was wondering if there’s a larger scale way I could help?
Rhi (as Older Man): Well, if you wanted to talk to someone higher up you’d want to see Mother Narya in The Arms of The Weeping Lady over in Six Towers. She more or less runs the organization right now. Unless you have more money than Lord Mora, I’m not really quite sure how much help you’d be able to be.
Rhi: He turns with the basket and puts it into your arms.
Josie (as Minx): Uh… Mm. Indeed.
Josie: So I guess I’m kind of roped into helping out now a little bit?
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, you get sent off to distribute food to some of the people who are here. What we see is the camera follows Minx as she’s toting this basket of food and she passes by Phin who’s, I imagine kind of crouched down talking to some people, and the camera swings around and stays with Phin. So, what was your approach here in finding somebody to talk to?
Madge: Yeah. I think my priority was finding people that I knew or who looked vaguely familiar.
Rhi: Let me do a fortune roll to see if you were able to find anyone. It’s a 2 and a 1. [laughs]
Madge: Heh. I know nobody.
Rhi: Yeah. There’s a couple faces that look vaguely familiar. You see a guy you’re like, I feel like I know you, but he’s asleep. Other people are talking to others. So, you kind of walk around a little bit as you’re sort of looking for people who you know, and you end up standing sort of on the edge of a little area where there’s two or three young families, younger adults with a number of children, none of them are probably older than 10, all of whom have kind of bunched together around an older woman who looks like she’s from The Dagger Isles. She looks old, but you’re not sure if she actually is as old as she looks. She has that weather beaten skin that says that she spent decades on the sea, you know out in the wind and the salt, and she seems to just be keeping an eye on everyone. She’s got a few kids that she is telling stories to while it looks like parents are sleeping or talking to each other. She looks up at you as you come over and looks you up and down.
Rhi (as Older Woman): Do you need something, miss?
Madge (as Phin): I was just looking for someone to talk to, someone who was in the Ink Row district.
Rhi: She exhales heavily and just kind of gestures around.
Rhi (as Older Woman): That was all of us.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. You looked like the sort not to judge or anything.
Rhi: She shrugs.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Um, I grew up on the docks. My family were fishers, so when I heard about what happened it was devastating.
Rhi (as Older Woman): Yeah, yeah, it’s uh… You know, I worked security at tattoo parlors over there, and I’m not quite sure what any of us are gonna do now.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, it’s not something any of us could really prepare for. Have you heard about what Lord Mora is planning to do with the area?
Rhi: She scowls and spits off to the side.
Rhi (as Older Woman): Yeah. We’ve all heard.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah… I’m part of a group that’s planning on making a move against Lord Mora—
Rhi: As soon as you get that far she holds up a hand to silence you. She looks down at the kids.
Rhi (as Older Woman): All right dears, me and this nice lady need to have a grown up chat, so why don’t you run on back to your parents for a bit?
Rhi (as Child): No! You were in the middle of the story. Come on…
Rhi (as Older Woman): If you’re good and don’t whine I’ll finish the story, but for now, go on, shoo.
Rhi: There’s some grumbling from the kids as they head back to their parents. She gets up and kind of walks you off a few steps, down an alley more away from people. [laughs] At this point, go ahead and make your roll. We’ll see how this plays out.
Madge: Yeah! I’m guessing this is gonna be more of a Consort.
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: Okay, that’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay. She crosses her arms and gives you an appraising look.
Rhi (as Older Woman): What group?
Madge (as Phin): The Magpies.
Rhi: Her eyes narrow even further.
Rhi (as Older Woman): Well, either you’re fucking with me because you read a headline, or you’re the real deal and you’re going to bring The Bluecoats down on all of us.
Madge: I’m gonna show the magpie tattoo that I got on my hand.
Rhi: She lets out a breath, like hissing between her teeth.
Rhi (as Older Woman): Look. I am sure you probably had very good reasons for what you did, and I mean I’m certainly not gonna shed any tears over dead nobility, but what are you doing here? What do you expect to get out of any of us, any of these people?
Madge (as Phin): I’ve driven him out of The Docks before, and I want to do it again, and make it so that he can never hurt anyone again.
Rhi (as Older Woman): Well, you’re certainly not lacking for ambition.
Madge (as Phin): Yep. Well, I don’t really aim small here.
Rhi (as Older Woman): Let’s pretend hypothetically that I was going to entertain your plan. What are you thinking?
Madge (as Phin): So, what we have in mind is we’re going to rile up some of the spirits of those who were lost and we’re going to clear out the area for a couple of days, during which time you will be able to get in and set up something similar to what you currently have here, and then when The Bluecoats and The Spirit Wardens eventually come back that’s when we start fighting.
Rhi (as Older Woman): That is probably the craziest plan I’ve ever heard. I spent 30 years as a privateer.
Madge (as Phin): I’ve done crazier.
Rhi (as Older Woman): There’s a lot of people who aren’t gonna be willing to take the risk. There’s a lot of people with kids and who aren’t gonna be willing to put them in the line of fire like that.
Madge (as Phin): Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Older Woman): But… I can ask around and see who would be willing.
Madge (as Phin): I’m not asking for every single one of you, I’m just asking for a handful. That’s all we need to start pushing back. Once a handful of us start fighting and succeeding, then more and more people are gonna join in.
Rhi (as Older Woman): All right. Well, I’ll see what I can do. This is crazy. You know that, right?
Madge (as Phin): Oh yeah. I am well aware.
Rhi (as Older Woman): All right. I guess it’s better to try and do something than just sit here.
Rhi: She kind of gives you a respectful nod, [laughs] kind of like “this is ludicrous, but I like it.”
Madge: [laughs] Nice.
Rhi: And she heads back to where she was before.
## Team Ghosts, Myra & Blaire [0:32:47]
Rhi: So, we will cut over to Myra and Blaire.
Kim: Woo-hoo!
Rhi: Myra and Blaire both go back to The Nest.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Myra goes to the bookshelves or wherever you all keep your collection of maps and things and spreads them out all over the table, and Blaire heads up to her room to talk to [emphatically] one of the eight ghosts that she was keeping in her room without telling anyone.
Kim: At least eight, there’s probably more. She thought you all knew.
Rhi: [laughing] She looks under the bed and is like, “aw crap, I forgot about you.”
Kim: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: Let’s start with Myra.
Minna: I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. You spread out all of the maps that you have and pour over them for a while. You are able to find a route…
Minna: Past The Spirit Wardens and The Bluecoats probably.
Rhi: Yeah, without having to go through them.
Minna: Yep, which is all that I wanted.
Rhi: But it’s not the most ideal route, because in order to get anyone in from, if you were going to bring people in from Charhollow through there, Charhollow is to the south of the ruined area, the entrance is to the north, so you would have to bring anybody… You would have to somehow sneak a whole bunch of people up through The Docks. Myra has found a way in. Blaire, tell us about your many, many ghost friends.
Kim: Blaire goes into her room and she locks her door as she does. Nobody’s allowed in Blaire’s room, that’s her space, and also because if anybody touched anything that they weren’t supposed to it’d probably be terrible for everyone involved. She goes to one of the shelves in her room where there are multiple jars lined up. These are the main ones that she can recall off the top of her head. Her room’s a little disorganized. The ones on that shelf are basically her to-do list, the ones that she’s planning on getting out to The Deathlands one way or another. She just goes down the row and tries to remember which one she most recently caught, because she imagines that if she let that loose to talk to for just a hot minute it would not be as angry about being cooped up for so long. So, she goes all the way down the row and she picks up the jar that she thinks is the most recent, and she is going to twist that open. I’m going to roll Attune.
Rhi: Mm-hmm!
Kim: Six!
Rhi: Okay. Who is this ghost? Who did you catch?
Kim: This ghost is… an Akoros woman.
Rhi: Mm-hmm?
Kim: Uh…
Minna: Uh… Her name is Nell [35:11, first use], and you rescued her from, like, somebody who was transporting a couple of spirits to a trafficker.
Kim: I like that. Okay. I rescued her from a trafficker, and her name’s Nell. Blaire’s just gonna wave.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi Nell!
Rhi: Nell has been… You consider ghosts to be people.
Kim: Exactly. Yeah.
Rhi: But even so, the majority of the ghosts that you interact with are at best beings of pure rage and hunger. They’re not super coherent. Nell has been weirdly normal.
Kim: Huh.
Rhi: She comes out and actually kind of stretches a little bit.
Rhi (as Nell): [groans] I hate that thing.
Kim (as Blaire): I know. I’m sorry. I need to get you out as soon as possible.
Rhi (as Nell): Well, um, what’s the reason that you have let me out now?
Kim (as Blaire): I actually have something to ask of you, and if you’re interested it actually does involve you being outside of the jar for a little while.
Rhi (as Nell): I see.
Kim (as Blaire): My crew is planning to do a ghost riot down in Ink Row.
Rhi: There’s a long, long pause while this ghost just stares at you.
[laughter]
Rhi (as Nell): I beg your pardon.
Kim (as Blaire): A ghost riot! Okay, so actually what the plan is—You probably didn’t know this, but it’s a long story. Ink Row like totally caught on fire—
Rhi: Let’s just cut at “Blaire explains the plan,” because I think we’ve explained the plan possibly three times at this point.
[laughter]
Kim: Yeah. Yeah.
Rhi: So, Blaire explains the plan to Nell, who is just like:
Rhi (as Nell): I see… So, you want me and…
Rhi: She gestures at the rest of the jars.
Rhi (as Nell): …the others to persuade 90-odd recently dead, traumatized, angry ghosts to attack The Bluecoats and The Spirit Wardens?
Kim: She gestures at the jars.
Kim (as Blaire): I think between the eight or so among us… I mean, we’re probably the best people for the job. I feel like- Listen. Those people were wronged. They would jump at the chance to go after those Bluecoats and Spirit Wardens.
Rhi (as Nell): I worry that you’re about to unleash something that you’re not going to be able to control.
Kim (as Blaire): But with your help!
Rhi (as Nell): I can try.
Kim (as Blaire): And by the time it’s all over you all can go to the spirit well, or if you wanna come back with me and I can get you into The Deathlands, either or. You’re free to do what you want basically, except you know harm the citizens, because we’re planning to move them back in there.
Rhi: She kind of nods considering this.
Rhi (as Nell): I have an alternate proposal.
Kim (as Blaire): Go on!
Rhi (as Nell): While I was with that trafficker I heard talk of a group of spirits who I suppose are more like me…
Minna: [whispered] Shit! The Reconciled…
Rhi (as Nell): [smiling] …not driven by hunger and vengeance. Rather than going to a spirit well or The Deathlands, I would like to join them.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh… Yeah, if you think you’ll be happy with them you can go there if you want.
Rhi (as Nell): I am not sure where they are or if they have a central location or anything, but I think I will have more success with them and I could attempt to find them in the meantime before your riot and see if any would be willing to aid.
Kim (as Blaire): The riot’s starting pretty soon, but I mean the more ghouls the merrier.
Rhi (as Nell): I will see if I can find them, but I will come to The Docks either way and assist you in this.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Promise me you’ll come back and tell me what you did.
Rhi (as Nell): I will.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay! Thank you so much!
Rhi (as Nell): I can at least speak to these others and likely persuade them to help as well. Also the two you have under your bed.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Oh! Oh shoot! I almost forgot about them!
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: She quickly scurries off and reaches for the rolled jars, and she just hugs them to her chest.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, I’m sorry!
Rhi: I think when you come back up Nell [39:18, last use] is gone. But yeah, so she’s at least going to be able to help with the ghosts that you know about and she might be able to round up some additional help. I’ll have to make a roll for that.
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: Yeah. Is there anything else that you guys wanna do in terms of prep work? You have a way to talk to the ghosts, you have a way into The Lost District… Or, not The Lost—Jesus.
Madge: The soon to be lost. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] yeah. You have a way into the destroyed Ink Row. Are you guys ready to kick this off?
Madge: Yep.
Josie: yeah!
## Regroup [0:39:56]
Rhi: All right. You’ve come back together, you’ve shared your plans, everybody is kind of in the common room with weapons and maps and vials of stuff and climbing gear and explosives, and just all of the stuff that you all take on your scores kind of spread out, and everybody is sorting through things. Yeah. What’s the mood like? What are you guys talking about?
Kim: I think Blaire at least is very cheerful. She’s chatting on about how Neera is gonna help, and she’s finding these people that I’ve never heard about before, and this is such a great plan, etcetera, etcetera.
Madge: Phin is picking up a blade and tossing it into the table, and is basically stabbing the table repeatedly to keep herself calm about the whole thing.
Josie (as Minx): Phin, remember to keep it to your portion.
Madge (as Phin): Yep. I’m keeping within my limits.
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna sit down next to her and put a hand on the wrist that is not playing with the knife.
Minna (as Myra): All right?
Madge (as Phin): I’ll be better once this is all over with.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think this is a thing that’s gonna be over quickly, even with tonight’s work done.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah… I mean, eventually I’ll be okay. I’m fine with not being fine, if that makes any sense.
Minna (as Myra): I know what you mean.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, because I just… I thought I’d shoved this guy far enough back to keep him away from The Docks. He just came back in and decided to take advantage of a tragedy, or even cause a tragedy, because he might be part of The Circle of Flame. If he is, it’s gonna be twice as great.
Minna (as Myra): That’s what these people do. We just… It’s good to feel like we have the power to do at least anything against it.
Madge (as Phin): Mm-hmm.
Minna (as Myra): I can’t believe that you did this back before when you were just on The Docks with friends. I can’t imagine.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I had Chael with me, and they helped a lot. They were a whole lot more experienced than I was, so…
Minna (as Myra): I’m trying to compliment your bravery, silly. [smiling]
Madge (as Phin): Oh.
[laughter]
Madge (as Phin): I’m not great at compliments. I’m glad that I have all of you with me this time.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww.
Madge (as Phin): Well, it’s true. You’re all way better friends than I had ever anticipated, and I’m glad that we’re in this together, no matter what happens.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww, Phin!
Kim: Blaire’s just gonna throw her arms around Phin.
Josie (as Minx): We’re very glad you’re here too.
## Score [0:42:27]
Rhi: On that, we cut over to the northern edge of Charhollow where there’s a group of maybe 30-odd people who have come together. they’re not super well equipped. Most of them look like they’re totally unarmed. A few have like daggers or knives, or there’s a couple people with truncheons, but it’s not a well equipped or well organized group, but they’re there.
When you two show up the woman that you spoke to previously who you have learned in other conversations as you’ve been organizing this that her name is Irma, she sees the two of you and walks over.
Rhi (as Irma): This is everybody who was willing to get back in there and put their lives on the line for our homes, so hopefully it’s enough.
Madge (as Phin): It’s more than I thought we were gonna get. I was expecting, like, 12.
Rhi (as Irma): Yeah, well there’s a lot of people who are pissed off and desperate, and quite literally have nothing left to lose.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah… Anger is good.
Rhi (as Irma): Yeah. Well, we got that in spades here.
Rhi: So, is your plan just to sort of work your way up to the tunnel entrance on The Docks?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. This is a big group of people, and I think even if you guys kind of split up into smaller chunks you still sort of have to stay kind of close together. as you are moving this group through the streets of Crow’s Foot, as you two come around a corner, you find yourselves facing a trio of Bluecoats blocking your path. The guy in front is like:
Rhi (as Bluecoat1): What’s all this then? Some kind of party that we didn’t hear about?
Josie (as Minx): No. we’re simply entering to retrieve some belongings.
Rhi (as Bluecoat1): You’re… not allowed to do that.
Madge (as Phin): Well, I’m sure you could make an exception.
Rhi: [musically] Time to make a roll.
Kim: [musically] Fuck the police.
Rhi: [laughs] Do you want to do that as a group action, you two?
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: Sure.
Rhi: What are you rolling?
Madge: Should we do Consort or Sway?
Kim: This feels like a Sway.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. You guys are lying like liars who lie.
Madge: I got a 6.
Rhi: Nice.
Madge: On my one die.
Josie: I got a critical.
Kim: Yo! That’s frightening.
Josie: There’s three of them and like 30 of us. What are they gonna fucking do? [laughs]
Rhi: The rest of the group starts coming around the corner behind you and building up. There’s some murmuring and shifting in the crowd of them getting agitated and restless. The Bluecoats look at the two of you, look at the crowd building up behind you, the three of them exchange a look and one of them is just like:
Rhi (as Bluecoat2): Man, it is not fucking worth it. Let them go in there and get possessed or whatever. Let’s just- We didn’t see nothing.
Rhi (as Bluecoat1): Yeah, screw it… Fine. Whatever. We didn’t see you, you didn’t see us.
Rhi: And they just walk off. [laughs]
Kim: Damn.
Josie: [laughs] All right.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you, dears.
Madge (as Phin): Have a good evening, gentlemen. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughing] You guys destroyed that roll. I think, because that was so successful for both of you, you make it up to the secret passage entrance without any other trouble.
Madge: Nice.
Josie: Excellent.
Rhi: Yeah. There’s a couple points where you have to slow down and wait for other groups of people to go by or other Bluecoat patrols, but nobody else stops you or interferes.
Minna: God. I’m just imagining, because it is a very hot, humid and still night here, I am just imagining it’s a really, really still night and there’s just the fog creeping up from the ocean.
[oohing]
Rhi: OH yeah. Yeah.
Minna: And you can just feel the tension in the air.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. As this group descends into the tunnels we’ll move over to Blaire and Myra. Where are you two? Have you already headed in to try to do stuff with the spirits?
Kim: Neera said she was gonna meet us at The Docks, so I feel like we have to go there.
Minna: Okay cool. Maybe we showed up a little bit earlier before Minx, Phin and Co. showed up.
Rhi: You two are in the ruined block. It’s just a bunch of burned out, collapsed buildings. Nothing’s really smoking anymore, but that smell of smoke and ash and everything is still really heavy in the air here. It’s very dark. You’re sort of picking your way amongst the rubble. As you’re sort of picking your way along, Blaire, there’s kind of a faint chill and a light little breeze, and then you hear Neera’s voice.
Rhi (as Neera): Oh good, you’re here.
Kim (as Blaire): You made it!
Rhi (as Neera): I did. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to make contact with any other spirits, but assuming that we make it through all of this I will continue my search.
Rhi: I think at that point a blueish light starts to sweep across the ruins. Blaire, you recognize this. It’s something that The Spirit Wardens use to basically illuminate ghosts.
Kim: It’s like a UV light kind of thing?
Rhi: A little bit, yeah. It’s just sort of slowly sweeping across the ruins straight towards the three of you, and I assume the many, many jars of ghosts that Blaire is carrying.
Kim: Well, I can only carry about two at a time. I was actually going to ask you. Can I do a flashback to say as a contingency in case Neera wasn’t going to be able to work this out that I brought two from home with me?
Rhi: I would say if you want to do a flashback you could say that since you knew where this tunnel was you moved the other jars in here already.
Kim: Yeah. I like that.
Rhi: Okay. That’s gonna be a 1 stress flashback.
Kim: That’s fine. Okay, good.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that’s where you were heading to, like you were picking your way over to where you had all of these jars stashed. You’ve just gotten there, and you’ve got this light that you know that if it hits you is going to light up Neera and these 10 spirit jars.
Kim: Is there any way we can get underground real quick from here?
Rhi: If you run back to where the tunnel is.
Kim (as Blaire): Neera, I need you to phase out. Someone’s coming.
Rhi: She sees the light…
Rhi (as Neera): I see.
Rhi: …and just [whoosh] drops down into the ground.
Kim: Blaire is gonna scoop up as many jars as she can.
Minna: Myra’s gonna help.
Kim: Oh thank you! She’s gonna scoop up about maybe four, I think she can carry four in her arms, and she’s gonna make a break for the tunnel.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, how many are you gonna try and grab?
Minna: Uh… The rest if possible.
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: Okay, that’s six. That’s a lot.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Oh God. Never mind. I miscounted in my head. Probably the same amount as Blaire
Kim: Yeah, four is like, I’m imagining an arm full of jars.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: I am gonna need you both to make some kind of roll to see how successful you are.
Kim: Would this be a Prowl to get away? I would think so.
Rhi: Probably. Prowl makes sense. You’re doing a physical thing, running away.
Kim: Five.
Minna: I rolled a 6.
Rhi: Myra, you are just able to run back really, really fast. You paid very close attention to the path that you took so you avoid any places where you would trip. Blaire, you also sprint, but you aren’t paying as close attention to the ground. You keep looking back over your shoulder to see where the light is and you trip. You don’t fall, but you stumble a little bit, and one of the jars slips out of your grasp and shatters on the ground behind you.
Kim: [sad whine]
Rhi: The ghost comes out. You duck underground, and the ghost is just sort of floating there confused right as the light hits it and lights it up.
Minna: [groans]
Kim: Nooo~!
Rhi: The two of you are kind of hunkered down in the entrance of this tunnel clutching all of these jars and you hear distant shouting.
Rhi (as Spirit Warden): We found one! Sector 3-D! Move in!
Kim: Blaire, underground, just kind of squeezes her eyes shut.
Kim (as Blaire): [sorrowfully] Oh… That was Alder. I was gonna take him out next.
Rhi: Next to Blaire’s head, Neera just pokes her head out of a wall. [laughs]
Kim: Oh- [laughs]
Rhi (as Neera): It seems things have become a bit complicated.
Kim (as Blaire): Yep, it’s my fault.
Rhi (as Neera): How do you wish to proceed?
Kim (as Blaire): We kind of have to wait it out until The Spirit Wardens get out of here.
Minna (as Myra): Just let them… Let them do it.
Kim (as Blaire): No~! Well, I mean there’s nothing I can do, but I tried to rescue him, give ourselves a break. At the very least we can use him as a distraction, I guess.
Minna (as Myra): I think it’s probably kinder if the ghost is disposed of.
Kim (as Blaire): No~! [sobbing] They’re supposed to go to The Deathlands.
Minna (as Myra): Do you want to roam The Deathlands? You know, this is not the time for this conversation.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s where at least they won’t be bothered by anyone. They can eat at spirit wells and, you know, take over whatever else lives out there. That’s where they belong.
Minna (as Myra): That spirit’s not gonna be aware of much for much longer. I don’t think there’s much we can do about that fact.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna cover her eyes with her hands and just try not to cry.
Josie: [sad noise]
Minna: I think Myra’s just gonna put a hand on her shoulder and just watch.
Rhi: Neera sort of looks back and forth between the two of you.
Rhi (as Neera): Would you like me to go and begin perhaps contacting the other spirits that are here, to rouse them for your… ghost riot?
Kim (as Blaire): [sobbing] Yeah. That’s fine.
Rhi (as Neera): Very well.
Rhi: She sinks back into the wall and disappears. From above you hear footsteps running through the rubble and things cracking as they move through, and then you hear a lot of loud electrical zapping and popping sounds, and a shriek, and then silence.
Kim (as Blaire): [yips] Aww…
Rhi: Eventually… footsteps heading back. I think by the time you hear The Spirit Wardens leaving you can also hear coming up the tunnel behind you is Phin and Minx, and their whole posse. They can’t come out of the tunnels until the ghosts are dealt with. What’s your next move?
Madge: To start the riot I guess.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna wipe her face and try to get ahold of herself.
Rhi: So yeah, Neera said she was gonna go and start rousing some of the ghosts. What’s Blaire doing?
Kim: She’s still trying to get ahold of herself, and by her I also mean partly me.
Rhi: Aw.
Josie: Aww…
Kim: Uh… I feel like what she can do right now is at least open up the jars she already has and try to relay the plan and disperse all of her merry little elves.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you’ll need to roll me something.
Kim: This would probably be Attune again, right?
Rhi: Yeah, probably.
Kim: Five.
Rhi: Yeah. You have nine ghosts. You explain the plan. Four of them tell you, in so many words, gusts of cold air, and angry gestures, to go fuck yourself, and they just leave.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh… Understandable.
Rhi: They just leave. They just take off.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Oh… Okay, bye~ I love you!
[all giggle, groan, and laugh in sweet sadness]
Rhi: “Be safe out there~” [laughing] God, I love Blaire.
Kim: [giggles]
Rhi: So, the other five ghosts though seem willing to hang around…
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: …although they are kind of drifting around impatiently.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, I know, I know baby.
Rhi: So, I rolled a 6 for her fortune roll.
Kim: Woo! Yes!
Rhi: So she comes back and again pokes her head through the wall.
Rhi (as Neera): I was able to persuade them to turn their anger in a productive direction.
Rhi: She just sort of points up. If the two if you poke your heads up and look through the ghost field, there’s a lot of spirits around here sort of drifting around. Neera looks back at you Blaire.
Rhi (as Neera): I think they just need a bit more direction. I did what I could.
Kim: Blaire’s just looking up in wonder and just whispers under her breath.
Kim (as Blaire): Neera, you beautiful bitch.
Rhi (as Neera): Thank you… I think?
Kim (as Blaire): [giggles] It was a complement. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to call you a bitch.
Rhi (as Neera): All right…
Rhi: She just sort of waves a hand.
Rhi (as Neera): I told them to wait until you ordered them to move, because I wasn’t sure what the timing on your plan was.
Rhi: She just sort of gestures.
Kim: I have an idea to call them to attention. I think that I have a piece of ectoplasmic food stuff from a spirit well, and Blaire’s just gonna take it out of one of her many pockets and just hold it up.
Rhi: Okay. I think for this you’re gonna need to make another roll to see how well you do at getting their attention.
Kim: I feel like Command, because I’m trying to like really get their attention.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah!
Kim: Even though I have no ranks in Command.
Minna: Do you want some help?
Kim: I would love an aid.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, you’ll take 1 stress.
Kim: I would also like to push myself to bring myself up to two dice and take the higher.
Rhi: Yeah! Okay.
Kim: Yo. I rolled double 6s.
Rhi: Shit!
Madge: [gasps] Ah! That’s amazing~! Crit!
Minna: Yesss!
Josie: Nice!
Rhi: Oh God…
Minna: That’s a lot of crits this episode. What’s gonna happen later?
Josie: Ghost riot!
Kim: This is amazing. This is the best night we’ve ever rolled, I think.
Rhi: So yeah, you hold this thing up, and what do you say to get them to start attacking?
Kim (as Blaire): Listen to me! Listen to me! I know you’re all hungry, and I know this little thing…
Kim: She’s gonna stuff it back into her pocket.
Kim (as Blaire): …is not gonna be enough to go around for all of you. This is what we’re going to do. I brought you all here because we’re starting a riot. I need all of you to hail down vengeance upon The Spirit Wardens and The Bluecoats. Now who’s with me for a ghost riot?!
Rhi: [giggles]
Kim: She’s not very good at speeches.
Rhi: [laughs] It’s so good though. They’re just kind of watching you with mild disinterest after you put the ectoplasm away, but as soon as you mention rain down vengeance everybody seems to perk up.
Kim: Ohhh yayyy~
[laughter]
Rhi: The ghosts fan out, heading just outward, some of them just keep going out, some of them sort of dip down into the rubble and come up with two or three other ghosts like trailing them.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] it’s beautiful.
Rhi: And they just swarm outward. As they move outward that blue light starts to sweep across again, and it’s just lighting up dozens and dozens of ghosts, and you just hear this explosion of yelling and panic coming from the edges.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): [shouting] They’re- They’re all coming up at- They’re all coming up at once! This is—[gasps]
Kim (as Blaire): This is the best day of my life…
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: There is screaming, and you hear more electric zapping and popping sounds. You hear gunshots firing. It is out in the darkness around the edge of this ruined area. It is chaos.
Madge: Ooh boy.
Rhi: What is your next move?
Kim: What is the next move, actually? I’ve done my part. [laughs]
Madge: [enthusiastically] Um! I honestly didn’t think we’d get this far! Um!
[laughter]
Rhi: You guys have rolled very, very well. I am starting racing clocks.
Madge: Oh goodness.
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: So, that basically means that we have two clocks, one clock is the ghosts drive off the guards, and the other is The Spirit Wardens defeat the ghosts, or at least drive them off.
Madge: Oh gosh.
Rhi: Whenever you all are able to assist the ghosts in pushing back The Bluecoats and The Wardens their clock will tick up, and if there are consequences or negative rolls The Wardens’ clock may tick up as well. So, [smiling] what are you guys doing? Who’s doing what?
Minna: I would like to do a flashback. [laughs]
Rhi: Go ahead and do your flashback.
Minna: So, this flashback, I think before they all started getting involved in all this Myra snuck onto the property through their passage and setup various tripwires and shit in the area that The Wardens would have to come across to get to their entrance.
Rhi: Okay. I’m gonna say like Blaire coming out there to plant her spirit jars that’s gonna be a 1 stress flashback.
Minna: We probably came at the same time, frankly.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that we see, we have that flashback of Myra stringing up tripwires and stuff, and then it comes back to the present and you see a Bluecoat running and firing electroplasmic shots, and then just trips and the gun goes flying and a couple ghosts just dive on him. There’s a lot of screaming.
Kim: Good.
Rhi: So, yeah, what are you guys doing right now?
Madge: We could go up there and start confusing guards.
Kim: Yeah. Let’s start some shit.
Josie: All right.
Madge: “They’re throwing rocks!”
Rhi: The four of you rush across the ruins here and come up upon a group of Bluecoats, about six of them, they’re kind of in a circle with their backs all facing in. they’re not as well equipped to fight spirits as The Spirit Wardens are, but they have some stuff. A couple of them have electrified truncheons, a few have pistols with electroplasmic rounds, and they’re holding their own against the spirits pretty well.
Josie: I think, in order to weaken their line… trance powder to the face!
Minna & Madge:: [giggles]
Rhi: All right. It’s one dose. You’ve got enough to take out one of them. Yeah, you can do that.
Josie: Yeah. Just so long as there’s essentially a hole in them now.
Rhi: Yeah. What are you gonna roll to do that?
Josie: I’m gonna roll a Skirmish about it. Five.
Rhi: You get one of these guards square in the face. This one guard goes slack and stares off into space and drops her pistol, but the two Bluecoats on either side of her very much notice you.
Josie: yeah, I imagine so.
Rhi: And turn on you with electrified truncheons, and they both just turn without hesitation to swing at you, so you are gonna be in a desperate position.
Kim: No!
Josie: [nervously] Okay…
Madge: I’m gonna use throwing knives to toss…
Rhi: Fuck somebody up?
Madge: Yeah. That would be Skirmish, right? Or Prowl, or Finesse?
Rhi: I mean, it could be any one of those.
Madge: Okay. I’m gonna say it’s gonna be Skirmish, because I’m a little bit closer, and also I have two dice in that.
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: I got a 6.
Rhi: Are you throwing at one of the people who are threatening Minx?
Madge: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. Minx, you’re looking at this person, they are raising the truncheon to swing down on you, and then all of a sudden three blades just [thunk, thunk, thunk] straight into their chest. They kind of look down, and wobble on their feet, and then fall backwards.
Madge: Heh.
Rhi: Myra or Blaire?
Kim: There are so many wonderful and awful ways I could mess somebody up in this situation.
Josie & Madge: [laughs]
Rhi: I’ll also say while Kim is pondering her many options for mayhem, that 5 and that 6 are gonna be enough to advance the ghost winning clock by 1.
Kim: Fabulous. I’m going to mark off one of my fun lightning hooks. I’m gonna say that I have that, and that’s my load.
Rhi: Oh… Oh shit. Okay.
Kim: And I’m gonna do a hit.
Rhi: And this is gonna continue to be risky.
Kim: Ahh, I got a 1.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Womp.
Kim: Great.
Rhi: You whip out with your lightning hook, and the guard that you’re swinging at blocks with their electric truncheon, and there’s just this massive crackle of electricity along these two weapons.
Kim: Yo…
Rhi: You both kind of stagger backwards and apart, but all of that crackling lightning snapping through the air zaps a bunch of the nearby ghosts and they’re removed from play.
Kim: No…
Rhi: We are moving up the Warden’s win clock by 1.
Kim: Blaire’s not good at fighting.
Madge: [sweetly] She’s good at other things, though.
Rhi: She got all these ghosts to fucking go off, though, so…
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Myra?
Minna: Myra is actually going to try and tempt a whole bunch of guards into one of the booby trapped areas. I think she’s gonna try and make it seem like she’s running away, but she knows how to get through that area and they don’t.
Rhi: Oh, okay. yeah.
Minna: What would a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: One of the ghosts gets distracted and starts going after you.
Minna: [laughing] I’m gonna go with the ghost one, because I was gonna suggest something like that but I thought it would be too much, but that’s always fun!
Rhi: Yeah. Go ahead and make your roll.
Minna: That’s a 4.
Rhi: I think on a 4 you have reduced effect. Only one of the guards gives chase, but so does one of the ghosts who is seeing a couple of tasty treats go sprinting off and pursues. What kind of trap does the one guard who follows you fall into?
Minna: I think it’s just a tripwire, I think she set up a bunch at various angles, so he goes tumbling over the rocks and hits his head.
Rhi: Yeah, I like that. You are now kind of a ways off from the rest of your group, and you feel the cold chill of a ghost closing in on you. Who wants to go now?
Josie: I mean, I wanna do a stabby.
Rhi: Yeah! You’re still in a desperate position.
Josie: Mm-hmm. I am, but I think the quickest way out of this desperate situation is to kill the thing making me desperate. I wanna do a stabby. Also, I just realized I have second level harm [<what she said, replace with level 2 harm ?]. Does that mean I’m at -1 die for this?
Rhi: Ooh. Yeah. What’s the flavor of harm? Is it that concussion?
Josie: It’s Concussed. Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah… Thank you for the reminder.
Josie: In that case, I’m gonna push myself then.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: You stab this person, but it’s one of those things where you both swing at each other at the same time. You stab them, and they hit their electric truncheon into the side of your neck.
Josie: Eek… ow.
Madge: Yeah, I will defend. [laughs]
Rhi: I don’t know off hand how Bodyguard works. Let me look at that.
Madge: When you protect a teammate take +1 die to your resistance roll.
Rhi: Okay. You are just making the resistance roll instead of Minx.
Madge: Mm-hmm. What will I be rolling?
Rhi: You will be resisting getting electrocuted with Prowess, and then you add your +1. This is gonna be like, what, 5?
Madge: …4, 5, yeah.
Rhi: Yeah! [laughs] Some stupid number of dice.
Madge: Six.
Rhi: You don’t take any stress. I’m just gonna say you are able to lunge in here and dramatically negate the harm entirely, because I like it.
Madge: Okay.
Rhi: Minx stabs, this person is swinging the truncheon towards her neck… How do you stop it?
Madge: I wanna do the cool thing where my arm reaches out and gets in the way…
Rhi: yes! And you just like arm block, and their arm just hits yours?
Madge: Yeah!
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: And I can use that to start my move of just punching them in the face.
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: Ooh, okay… Um, 3?
Rhi: You take a swing at the Bluecoat, but Minx had also already run this person through on her rapier, so they are already falling back. You take a swing and their face is just falling back out of range, but as they fall and you’re able to get a clear view of the field again, you can see that The Wardens are overcoming their initial shock and have rallied and are starting to deal with the spirits pretty handily. That clock for the Warden win is pushed up to a 2 out of 4.
Madge: [squeaks] No~!
Josie: Eek.
Rhi: Blaire or Myra, who wants to act next? There’s actually only two Bluecoats left in this immediate vicinity.
Kim: I feel like I’ve gotta just do something to help even the odds of this. I want to do something arcane-like, some kind of arcane attack to whatever remaining Bluecoats in the vicinity.
Minna: Setarra’s back in town.
Rhi: Holy shit! That would escalate the situation immensely.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Would it escalate it in our favor though?
Rhi: … Possibly.
Kim: Okay. Fuck it. I’m gonna use Attune and do a ritual real quick, I’m gonna summon Setarra.
Rhi: You are?!
Minna: [coughing, laughing] I’m coming up with every terrible idea this session! Why?!
Rhi: All right!
Kim: The ghosts need to win. Listen, The Wardens are half way to winning this battle.
Madge: Oh, we’re gonna die.
Minna: I really need The Wardens to not win this.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah.
Kim: Yeah. I’m pulling all the guns. I’m gonna use Ritual. That’s gonna be an Attune?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Do you wanna push yourself, or Devil’s Bargain?
Kim: If I push myself, how many dice would that give me, three?
Rhi: That will give you another die. You’ll take 2 stress.
Kim: Ah, fuck it. I’ll do it. I’ll push myself.
Rhi: All right.
Kim: Six.
Rhi: Shit… All right.
Kim: [laughs]
Minna: Yes!
Kim: [laughing] Minna, this is your fault.
Minna: [smiling] This entire everything is my fault at this point.
Kim: Does anybody else in The Magpies know that I’m friends with a demon?
Madge: No?
Josie & Minna: I don’t think so?
Kim: [laughing] Oh my God.
Rhi: So, the rest of you just see Blaire crouch down, and then a very tall woman with slicked back, sleek, dark hair and a long, elegant, deep black gown with little pinpricks of light that sort of moves as if it’s waves.
Minna: Ooh, she looks like the sea…
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Just sort of pops up in front of Blaire.
Minna: [laughs] Oh gosh.
Rhi: And looks down at Blaire, raises her head, looks around the area, and then looks back at Blaire with the faintest of smiles.
Rhi (as Setarra): You seem to have found yourself in quite a situation, small one.
Kim (as Blaire): Please, I need your help. The ghosts need to win this. We can’t afford to lose.
Rhi (as Setarra): What do you wish me to do?
Kim (as Blaire): What you do best.
Rhi: Is that the only order you’re giving her?
Minna: Jesus Christ, please no.
[laughter]
Josie: There’s probably a fucking loophole.
Kim: [laughing] No it is not.
Minna: That’s more hole than loop.
Kim (as Blaire): I need every single Bluecoat and Spirit Warden gone.
Rhi (as Setarra): In the city? That is a rather tall order.
Kim (as Blaire): On The Docks! On The Docks!
Rhi: She looks around, squints a bit at the people that are out there, and then looks back down at you. For the first time in all that you’ve known her, Setarra gives you a big, shark-toothed grin.
Rhi (as Setarra): It would be my pleasure.
Kim: Yes!
Rhi: She… She doesn’t run. You wouldn’t even really describe it as a charge. It’s like watching a wave surge up onto the shore.
Several: Ooh, wow…
Rhi: She just crashes into another group of Bluecoats. It’s pretty dark, they’re not super close, you can’t see exactly what she’s doing but you can hear the screaming. The screaming goes on for a while. She’s not being terribly quick about this.
Kim: Well, you can’t rush on it.
Rhi: Jesus… She doesn’t linger with that group, but she doesn’t seem to be “killing” them. She’s just leaving them screaming in pain on the ground.
Kim: I mean, whatever works.
Rhi: We’re gonna tick your clock up another 1, because you just unleashed a fucking sea demon.
Josie: Hey!
Kim: [musically] I’m the best at Blades!
Rhi: This is so good! [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, dear, what the hell do you keep in your room?
Kim (as Blaire): [deliberately] I called reinforcements.
Madge (as Phin): Egh…
Kim: She says that in a tone as in “we will talk about this later.” [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] meanwhile, Myra?
Minna: I’ve still got a ghost on me.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Minna: I would like to convince the ghost that hey, we’re on the same side here, my dude.
Rhi: How do you wanna do that?
Minna: I would like to Consort about it?
Rhi: Okay. That’s gonna be risky.
Minna: Well, I got a 5.
Rhi: What do you say?
Minna: I realize it’s coming towards me, and I hold up a hand before it gets too close.
Minna (as Myra): [shouting] Hey! I am not the enemy here. The Bluecoats and The Spirit Wardens, they’re the ones who are standing with the people who burnt down your home. I know what it’s like when they just let the destruction happen, and I want to stop it too. So, turn around and help me get rid of them!
Rhi: The ghost surveys you for a few long moments, and then gives you a slow nod and turns and drifts away. You let out a big sigh of relief, and it is at that point that the guard who tripped, who is behind you, slashes you across the back of the leg, like trying to hamstring you, just gets you with a dagger.
Minna: Gah!
Rhi: That’s gonna be level 2 harm.
Minna: Wait, armor, right? Armor’s a thing.
Rhi: Oh yeah. You could also be armored. Uh-huh.
Minna: Yeah! I haven’t used any of my load yet. I’ll use 2 on that.
Rhi: Okay. Then yeah, I’ll knock it down to level 1 harm. Instead of it being like you’ve had important muscles cut it’s now just like a gash on the back of your leg. It hurts, but you can still run.
Minna: Thank you.
Rhi: Yep. Let me give a summary of where we are. Both clocks are currently 50% filled, 3 out of 6 for the ghosts winning, 2 out of 4 for the Wardens and Bluecoats. In the little pack that you’re dealing with right here there are two Bluecoats left who look profoundly freaked the fuck out, because a woman just appeared and then ran off and started murdering the ever living shit out of their fellows. So, they are I think probably starting to back off from you. There are still a lot of Bluecoats and Wardens and the like up. Do you want to deal with these two who are still here or do you wanna just try to ditch them and go for other targets? What’s your move here?
Madge: [musically] I wanna go for a Warden please.
Rhi: Okay. Phin, you see what looks like probably reinforcements coming with a Spirit Warden in the lead, and then behind them are some Bluecoats who are fending off some ghost attacks so they’re a little slowed down.
Madge: Yeah. Can I down my rage essence?
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: Yup.
Minna: [smiling] I love that we’re just pulling out all the stops.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Eh, season finale, man.
Minna: I know~
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah! Do it. You have enough of your awareness to still recognize who your friends are, but otherwise you need to beat the shit out of every one of these god damn motherfuckers who are enabling this system that just killed all of these people whose spirits are out here.
Madge: Yep! I’m gonna use my scary brass knuckles. I got a 3…
Rhi: Oof. Okay. I think what we see is Phin downs the rage essence, charges the Spirit Warden, and as she’s rushing a Bluecoat arm with a truncheon just snaps out and clotheslines her.
Madge: Oof.
Rhi: And she tumbles to the ground, and we cut away.
Madge: Sorry guys. [laughs]
Josie: Excellent. [laughs] I have a flashback action. Before this all happened I went to meet with Bazso and essentially pitched to him:
Josie (as Minx): Listen. Both The Spirit Wardens, at this time and this place, and The Bluecoats are going to be off balance, in the same place, and after a short scuffle very easy to clean up. I’m only doing it so the working folk can get their homes back… but we need help.
Rhi: I think you’re meeting with Bazso in his office here. He kind of surveys you for a long minute.
Josie: I’m still kind of dressed down. My hair is down a little bit.
Rhi: Bazso considers you for a long moment after you make this proposal.
Rhi (as Bazso): Two conditions. One, you owe me, you owe me big. Next time I ask you and your crew for a favor you do it. You don’t get to argue, you don’t get to negotiate, you just do it. Two, this is our show. The Lampblacks organized this whole thing. We get the credit, we get the loyalty of these people.
Josie (as Minx): I’m not doing this for their loyalty, Bazso. Fine, you can play the hero in this.
Rhi: I think on that is where we cut back to coming up through some of the alleys and side streets approaching this section of the dock is a whole bunch of black clad thugs that have streaks of coal dust on their hands and faces. They come up on The Wardens and The Bluecoats and just start laying into them.
Josie: Yes!
Madge: [sighs in relief]
Rhi: Between that and fucking Setarra, it’s going to be enough to pretty quickly… the Wardens and the Bluecoats, the ones who are still standing, just retreat.
Josie: Oh wow.
Rhi: Some of the Bluecoats start trying to fight back against the Lampblacks as they’re pushing back through the streets, some of the Wardens are still trying to deal with stray spirits, but things have kind of quieted around all of you. Blaire, in the distance kind of rushing off down an alley you see Setarra chasing after some Bluecoats. She disappears from view. Blaire, Minx, Myra, the three of you are still standing there amidst the wreckage. Where’s Phin?
Josie: Has anyone seen her?
Rhi: You don’t see her anywhere.
Minna (as Myra): Phin?
Kim (as Blaire): Phin?
Josie (as Minx): Phin, dear?
Rhi: There’s no answer.
Minna: I think Myra’s turning, and honestly spots random ghosts and is like:
Minna (as Myra): Have you seen Phin?!
Rhi: The ghost just sort of stares at you very blankly and drifts on. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: [smiling] It was a… She is panicking a little bit.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Minx is just gonna slump against a burned out post, dejected.
Minna: Myra was kind of away from the group when all the shit went down including Phin downing rage essence.
Rhi: And taking off.
Minna: So she turns to everyone else.
Minna (as Myra): What happened?!
Josie (as Minx): Last I saw her she downed her special vial and did her thing.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] Oh God. Who knows when and where she’ll come down. You have to keep an eye on her when she does that shit.
Josie (as Minx): I’m sorry.
Rhi: As the three of you are standing there you hear footsteps approaching. You all sort of perk up like “oh hey, maybe Phin’s back.” It’s not Phin. It is Bazso, flanked by a couple of his lieutenants. He’s got a bloody cut on his forehead. Minx, what is Bazso armed with? What’s his weapon of choice?
Josie: Ooh. That’s a good question.
Minna: I have a suggestion.
Josie: Uh-huh?
Rhi: [snickers]
Minna: One of those… Because lamplights! They have those long sticks with the things on the end that they use to light lamps. What if he just hits people with one of those?
Josie: Like he’s turned it into a spear or some shit?
Minna: No, like he hits people with one of them. [laughs]
Rhi: He just beats people with it.
Josie: It’s a long iron pole.
Minna: Like, he puts weight into it. It seems like it’d be a decent thing to hit people with.
Rhi: I like that. So yeah, he comes over kind of dragging his lamplighter’s pole along behind him and sort of looks the three of you over.
Rhi (as Bazso): Well… When Ellie told me what you all were planning I was pretty sure that she had lost what little remained of her mind, but you all were far more effective than I expected.
Kim (as Blaire): Ellie?
Rhi: He kind of looks at Myra and gives you a nod.
Minna: Myra nods back.
Rhi (as Bazso): So, I hear I’ve got some people to meet and get setup here. I’ll have some of my crew work on defense. I’m sure the poor bastards who used to live in this area probably aren’t exactly trained in self-defense, so we’ll help hold this position.
Josie (as Minx): [sighs] Indeed.
Josie: Yeah. I’ll just kind of nod towards the tunnel.
Rhi (as Bazso): All right, well… Good work, and remember our agreement.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, yes, dear.
Rhi: He winks at Minx, and him and his people head off. What do the three of you then do next?
Kim: We need to look for Phin.
Minna: Yeah. I think Myra’s gonna stay out looking for Phin for a while.
Rhi: Yeah. The three of you comb the area and there’s no sign of her.
Josie (as Minx): Well, at least this means she’s likely not dead. She was probably taken.
Rhi: We fade out on the three of you picking through the wreckage, and come back in on another front page of the Doskvol Daily. The big headline is: “Ghosts Overrun Warden and Bluecoat Position, Squatters Take Over Ink Row Ruins,” something along those lines. One of the columns off to the side is: “Avrathi Killer Arrested—“
Minna: Oh no…
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: And there is a sketch of Phin, and even in the sketch you can tell that she is bloodied and snarling.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: [groans] Oh no… Phin, baby.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, at least she survived.
Rhi: The article outlines that she is being held without bail pending trial for the assassination of the Iruvian ambassador. The article says that her conspirators are still missing, but with one member captured they expect—there’s a quote from a Bluecoat chief who’s boasting that she expects to be able to catch the rest of The magpies very swiftly.
Kim (as Blaire): [groans]
Rhi: It pans out from that to a table in The Hound’s Paw which is totally empty, and it is the three of you, and Rigney comes over with four shots and sets them down and then sits down in a chair with you guys for the first time ever.
Minna: [whines] Aww.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi (as Rigney): I mean, I get why you did it an di get why Phin would have wanted to do it, I mean that’s always been her way, her drive, was standing up for those people, but… [heavy exhale]
Minna (as Myra): She was right.
Rhi (as Rigney): You really think it was worth it?
Kim (as Blaire): I know.
Minna (as Myra): Those people have a place now. That’s what she wanted. That’s what I want.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, what if they execute her
Minna (as Myra): That’s not going to happen.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, even if she only ends up in Iron Hook that’s still… [sighs]
Josie (as Minx): We’re acting like she’s not coming back.
Minna (as Myra): She’s going to come back. She’s surprisingly resilient.
Rhi (as Rigney): I don’t know how surprising it is.
Rhi: Rigney picks up the shot.
Rhi (as Rigney): To Phin.
Josie (as Minx): To Phin.
Kim (as Blaire): To Phin.
Minna (as Myra): To Phin.
Rhi (as Rigney): That she comes back as soon as she can.
Rhi: On all of them clinking their glasses, we cut to Phin who is being marched down a hall in Iron Hook. How does she look?
Madge: Eh, not great. [laughs] You said even in the sketch in the paper she was looking pretty beat up. I feel like since that was drawn up she’s gotten even more beat up.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Madge: [laughs] Because it would make sense.
Rhi: They did some questioning.
Madge: It’s very obvious that she’s still trying to shake off the rage essence. She’s not looking completely there. I feel like every so often she’ll try to step out of line and punch someone, but will get yanked right back into line, and still has handcuffs on, so. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. I think they march her down the hall, one of the guards unlocks the cell door, and then two guards hold onto you, like one on each shoulder, while they unlock the manacles behind you, then a really hard shove into the cell. Phin kind of staggers on her feet and turns back around to look just as the cell door clangs shut.

Rhi: Hello listeners. For this episode, we’re not welcoming you to Duskwall, instead we’re taking a little bit of a breather between seasons and doing a Q&A episode. It’s the five of us chatting and answering some audience questions. We’ll be back with the Season 2 opener in two weeks.
Some quick announcements: I continue to be going to AcadeCon from November 9 through 11. If you’re going, let me know or track me down while we’re there and get a cool bookmark.
Minna and Madge will be on the soon to be released weird west Monster of the Week podcast, iron Hides. I will put a link to more information about that in the show notes.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s Featured Charity. Assata’s Daughters is a Chicago organization that supports, serves, and uplifts women identified young Black people. The group provides education to Black girls and women in radical Black feminism, political organization, and liberation. They offer educational programs and workshops, organize protests and resistance actions, and maintain a community garden for the neighborhood. If you can spare a few dollars consider donating.
Midterm elections in the United States are exactly one week from today. Please vote, and please continue to call your representatives, protest, donate… resist.
And now, your bonus episode.
## [0:01:28]
Rhi: Hi everybody! Welcome to our Season 1 Wrap-Up and Q&A episode. You guys are all probably still a little bit angry at me for how I ended the season finale.
[giggling]
Madge: I’m not!
Rhi: Let’s start off with introductions.
Kim: Hi. My name is Kim. I play Blaire Culhane, and you can find me on Twitter at @kimdianajones.
Rhi: What was one of your favorite moments from Season 1?
Kim: One of my favorite moments from Season 1 was when I critically succeeded Blaire’s Command roll to call all those ghosts to action, and she had that little speech.
Rhi: Yeah. That was very good. I just edited that a couple days ago and it was great.
Kim: It was just a very rewarding character moment for me.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Hi, I am Josie Siino. You can find me on Twitter at @DragonGirlJosie, and a bunch of other places that I link to from there. My favorite moment…
Rhi: Oh! Say who you play. Heh.
Josie: Oh, right! I play Minx. Hi! My favorite moment from Season 1 probably would be the finale, honestly, just how everything came to a head and the pace we went through it at, and all the character moments. That whole episode left me feeling really good. Or rather, bad in a good way.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Emotionally devastated is I think kind of a goal to aim for when telling a story.
Madge: Yeah. That sounds about right, especially for a season finale.
Rhi: Yep.
Minna: Hi, I’m Minna. I play Myra Keel. You can find me on Twitter at @mynaminnarr. I realize my Twitter handle is a nightmare, I don’t like it either. [laughs] Oh God, favorite moments… It’s really hard to pick a favorite moment, because I really like this show. [laughs]
Rhi: Well, you don’t have to pick—It doesn’t have to be the top favorite moment, it can just be one of your favorite moments.
Minna: [smiling] Listen. As we speak, we just published the Doskvorn episode, and anyone who knows me knows I’m a found family feels goblin, so I’m gonna have to go with that, especially Myra and Phin exchanging gifts because Phin and I cooked that up behind the scenes and I’m so happy it happened.
Madge: [giggles]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, it was a very good episode.
Minna: Did I say Phin and I cooked it up?
Madge: yeah!
Rhi: You did! Yeah!
[laughter]
Minna: Well, what I mean is I was looking at your name lighting up in the voice chat, and it says Phin, and it doesn’t have Madge in it.
Madge: Oh. [laughs] So hi, I’m Madge. I play Phin on The magpies, which is the podcast that you’re listening to right now… [nervous laughs]
Minna: [squirms, smiling]
Madge: You can find me on Twitter at @madgequips. You can also find me on pretty much any social media at that tag. My favorite moment from Season 1 was also the Doskvorn episode, just because I got to do a lot of character stuff with Phin that I didn’t usually get to do, especially with Phin getting the tattoo on her hand. I thought that was super cool, and gave another layer to her character about how much The Magpies mean to her…
Minna: Mm-hmm~!
Madge: …just in case that episode didn’t hit you hard enough with found family feels.
[laughter]
Rhi: And I am Rhi. I am the GM, so I play everybody else. I think one of my favorite moments—and this is one of, I have a lot of favorite moments—but I think one of my favorite moments is going way back to the very beginning of the show when I introduced Kay.
Kim: Hell yes.
Madge: Oh yeah!
Rhi: I did not have a name for her. I was just like, I needed a throwaway exposition dump character, and I described this…
Madge: And you gave us Gwendoline Christie?
Rhi: …tall, buff, tattooed Gondolier woman, and everybody in the game was like, oh my God we love her, and so I was like shit, now I’ve got to give her a name and have her come back.
Madge: Yup. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah, you just very casually, for this throwaway character, ruthlessly attacked all of us.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: You created someone that catered to all of our interests.
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. I love those moments where I will come up with something very random and on the fly, and you guys just grab it and run, because that leads to some pretty cool stuff, because Kay has been a super cool character.
Madge: Yeah.
## [0:06:09]
Rhi: My next question that I have for everybody is: What is one of your most unexpected or surprising moments?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: We’ll go in reverse order this time.
Madge: Oh no~ [laughs]
Rhi: [smiling] So, Madge?
Madge: [smiling] Oh man… Uh… So, something that I wasn’t expecting but that I seriously love is honestly how Blaire and Phin just relate to each other…
Kim: Yeah.
Madge: …and how we got this weird mix of BuzzFeed Unsolved with these two. [laughs]
Kim: Buzzfeed Unsolved is big inspiration for us.
Madge: Yeah. Specifically just how, it’s not even like a Bergara-Shane split, because…
Kim: Right! I feel like we have a mix of both in both of us. I’m obviously reverent to the spirits, but also I’m not scared of them.
Madge: Yeah, you’re pissing them off on purpose.
Kim: It’s a mix of both of them.
Madge: And like, Phin believes, and fiercely so, but has the “we don’t touch them” mentality about it.
Kim: [laughs] yeah. We have this very fun comradery. I love antagonizing Phin.
[laughter]
Madge: We need to do it more in Season 2.
Rhi: Yeah. I will say that is absolutely one of my favorite things when I’m editing, where Blaire will just say something completely bonkers off the wall in relation to spirits, and then Madge is always the first one to be like “Nooo! What are you doooing?!”
[laughter]
Kim: “Hey, check out this cool glowing bug.” “Nooo.” [laughs]
Madge: Ahhh!
Rhi: “Nooo!” [laughs]
Madge: “Don’t do that!” [laughs]
Rhi: “I’m gonna put it in my mouth!”
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah, Minna, what have you got?
Minna: [smiling] God! I don’t have good answers because I don’t remember. Guys, I have no memory! [laughter] I listen to the show, which means I remember surprises that happened months and months and months ago. I’m gonna go really terrible with this, [laughs] and say that in the finale Kim made a Jurassic Park reference and I understood it, and that was a huge surprise.
Kim: I remember that! Yeah!
Minna: And I still giggle about that.
Kim: Did we keep that in the episode, or do we have to explain that, Rhi?
Rhi: It’s in the bloopers.
Minna: It’s in the bloopers? Oh. I need to choose a good one anyway! I feel like I get really excited when random backstory stuff suddenly comes in, so I’m gonna say when Clave showed up at the auction.
Madge: Yeah! That was intense.
Rhi: Oh yeah. Yeah. That was really good.
Minna: Look, sometimes Rhi just occasionally caters to me, and I get really excited.
Rhi: I do my best to do that for everybody.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Josie?
Josie: I think my favorite surprise also comes from the finale when Blaire just up and summoned a fucking demon.
Rhi: [laughs] yeah!
Josie: That’s just a thing that happened! As a subset of that, just discovering what Setarra looked like, and you describing the shark toothed grin…
Kim: She is very hot. I should draw her sometime.
Josie: Yeah! I was just like, how dare you? How…? [stammers]
Kim: Oh yeah. No. She attacks me just as much.
Josie: You two are mean.
Rhi: I was just editing that scene earlier today, and I realized that I’m playing Setarra as the chaotic evil version of a character, basically of the sea witch, The Ludiaeg from the October Day books.
Kim: [gasps] Ohhh!
Rhi: I don’t know if anybody else in our listening audience reads those books, but if there’s one person out there who does, I hope you appreciate that.
Minna: Did you attack every single one of us in that episode?
Madge: Yeah, at some point.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: That’s my goal.
Kim: That’s her job.
Rhi: [laughs] Kim, what have you got for surprises?
Kim: A lot of the good ones have already been said, so that’s why I’m struggling. One of my favorite surprises was revealing Blaire’s family history, that she has a twin sister that she’s very close to, and she actually comes from a fairly decent family in general. I feel like that’s where an RPG character is…
Rhi & Madge: Yeah.
Kim: Mine at least.
Minna: Especially in Blades.
Rhi & Madge: Yeah.
Kim: Blaire was fairly normal from a family perspective.
Rhi: I think my favorite surprise was Phin murdering Avrathi.
Madge: [cackles]
Minna: Yes!
Josie: Yeah!
Madge: I was gonna bring that up if no one else did!
Rhi: That was real good. I was not… It was a great moment, and it took me totally by surprise.
Minna: That was so badass.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. It was like, “I’m just gonna shoot her… to kill.” … Okay!
Madge: [giggles] yeah…
Rhi: Oh, yeah, that was extremely good.
Madge: We’re gonna be dealing with the repercussions of that for a really long time, but I’m really glad.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Oh yeah. It raises the stakes though.
Madge: Yeah!
## [0:11:16]
Rhi: Okay! Those are the questions that I had for folks. Now we’re gonna move into our audience questions. [cheering] We had a lot of people actually send in questions to us on Twitter. We’ll start with this question from… I just realized in doing this I have doomed myself to try to pronounce everybody’s Twitter handles, which is gonna be pretty fun.
From @JobotBobica: Is the game really on the rules-lighter side, or do you just cut those parts off in the edit? How long do you edit an episode on average?
Relative to a game like D&D, it is rules-lighter.
Madge: Yeah. It’s way less crunch than D&D, especially when it comes to combat.
Rhi: Yes. That said, I also do cut a LOT of the rules stuff, just because in my opinion, I don’t think it makes for good radio. A lot of the mechanics stuff I do end up cutting. For the second question, I end up cutting about 50% of the audio that we record, so if we have three hours of audio it ends up with an hour and a half of usable podcast episode ready audio, which works out pretty well for me because it tends to mean that I can get two episodes out of one recording session, which is nice.
Madge: Yeah. It just makes me think “Magpies Podcast, only 50% garbage!”
[laughter]
Kim: There is so much trash you guys don’t get to hear.
Madge: Oh my gosh. Yeah, like masses.
Rhi: The main thing that I cut is me saying “um,” and “uh,” and “okay, so…”
Kim: Another quarter of that is me meme-ing off.
Rhi: One thing that I cut a lot of is someone will go “What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?” Thirty seconds of silence while I stare into the distance trying to think of a good Devil’s Bargain. [laughter] Yeah, it is a fairly rules-light game, but we are an even rules-lighter podcast.
## [0:13:36
Madge: Yeah. There’s another half of this question that I think is really cool for us, the question about a gaming go bag. I know that we record at home, but I still have a specific set of stuff that I bring with me every single time we go to record and I’m sort of wondering if anyone else does the same thing.
Kim: Yeah, let’s do that question, because I do.
Rhi: Yeah, sure. This was another question that @JobotBobica sent in.
For each of the players, what’s in your gaming go bag?
As Madge said, we record remotely. We are five people in five states and four time zones, so you should all be really impressed with the fact that we are able to get together to record, at all.
Madge: You thought it was hard to get your group together to play.
Rhi: Yeah. The scheduling is… I mean, we’ve got it pretty good now.
Kim: Yeah. We’ve done pretty okay, all things considered.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: If we’re not available to meet at the one time every two weeks when we’ve got it scheduled, it’s like “welp, that’s it.”
Madge: Sorry!
Josie: Yup!
Rhi: Madge, why don’t you go first on answering that question?
Madge: Yeah. In my gaming go bag I have a bullet journal that I’ve used and basically converted into a notes document and a character sheet for Phin. I have notes about her family in there. I have notes about significant events that have happened throughout gameplay that I can remember. I also keep a whole dice bag with me, even though we only play with d6s, because Rhi actually made me a dice bag and it’s really pretty, and I like having it on the desk with me. Then, I will usually have something to just fidget with, because I have ADHD and focusing is really hard.
Rhi: Anybody else have standard stuff that they have set out when we’re recording?
Kim: yes. Yes. In my gaming go bag, I have my character sheet up, obviously, in a PDF document. I always make sure I have water with me when we’re recording.
[mm-hmm-ing]
Madge: Oh yeah, that too. That’s big.
Kim: Water’s just super important, because we’re talking for like three to four hours on average when we record, and voice quality is something that’s very important to me, especially when I’m doing character voices, that’s why I’m always making sure that I stay hydrated. In addition to dice, I just keep d6s on my desk, it’s just a bunch of random d6s that I’ve gathered from my mess of a dice bag. I’m looking into getting character specific dice for Blaire soon.
Madge: Aw! That would be so good~!
Kim: Yes, I’m looking into doing that soon, but I’ve yet to make that purchase. The other thing in my gaming go bag, on sessions where I feel like I’m not going to be as focused, I have a little journal with these toned pages. It’s more like a sketch book. What I do is, I have a dip pen and a container of ink on my desk, and I like to take notes in character.
Minna: [grunts in approval]
Madge: Ah!
Josie: That’s amazing.
Minna: That’s so cool.
Kim: I like to take down notes as Blaire would imagine things, and I do little doodles in the margins…
Madge: Oh, that’s so awesome.
Kim: …I just do little sigils and stuff, and it’s super fun. It’s something that keeps me engaged, not only in character but also keeps me paying attention to what’s happening in the game as well.
Minna: I did not know you did that. That’s really fucking cool.
Rhi: I remember you telling me that you were gonna start doing that, because we had to test to see if it would be okay on the audio, but I don’t think I’ve actually seen any of the stuff.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So yes, definitely share that.
Kim: Yeah, my pen is a little loud. I have to give credit to Holly Conrad, @HollyConrad is her Twitter, but in her D&D campaign she takes in character notes sometimes and I remember seeing pictures of that on Twitter a long, long time ago.
Josie: Aww.
Madge: For Strix. Yeah.
Kim: I was just like, oh my God, that’s a great idea, so I just adapted that for Blaire.
Minna: I also have specific things.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it.
Minna: I do have character specific dice for Myra. I bring my whole dice bag, but I dig out these swirly green and white dice with gold pips, they’re the little Chessex 12m. Those are Myra’s dice. I just got a bunch of d6s for her. I also always have my physical Blades book on hand. I also usually have the PDF Blades book open in case I need to quickly find a section. I have a Notepad document for notes, and a second one for if I need to reference Myra backstory stuff… and I keep my character sheet in Google Sheets. If anybody follows me on Twitter I’ve definitely posted blank character sheets. That’s the one I use.
Rhi: And they’re so beautifully crafted.
Minna: I should find those, dig up the links on Twitter somewhere.
Madge: [laughs] Put them in the show notes. Does anyone have a dice jail?
Kim: I don’t personally have a dice jail, but during sessions if one die is particularly rolling bad I will set it aside on my desk, and I’m just like you’re banned for the rest of the night.
Rhi: [laughs]
Madge: Yeah. I have a tin that I use for dice jail. [laughing] And there are a lot of d6s in there, because people know that in the back half of sessions my dice will betray me.
Rhi: They’re doing it for the drama!
Madge: Neh!
## [0:18:40]
Rhi: This is one question that I definitely wanted to do, because Josie and I have talked about this a little bit. @Open_Sketchbook sent in a question:
What is transitioning like medically/magically n your take on Blades? I always want to know this about every fantasy world.
Minna: I was curious about that.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a really good question. I’ll give my very broad answer, and then Josie if you’ve got more details that maybe you’ve thought of for Minx and some of the other characters…
Josie: I do. I came prepared for this one.
Rhi: My thinking was that this is a setting with alchemy, so I have just been sort of thinking of it as there’s alchemical things, potions and the like, that are used. Again, this is a setting where you can turn ghosts into drugs and like drink ghosts’ dreams, so I feel like people can probably figure out a way.
Madge: Don’t do ghost drugs.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. In this setting, if you’re able to do that I feel like you can probably also figure out a way to, you know, handle the physical transitioning if people want to do that through alchemy as well. Those are my kind of broader thoughts on it. Josie, I will pass this off to you.
Josie: Yeah. I put a lot of thought into this in every RPG I play, because just by default all of my characters are trans unless stated otherwise for whatever reason. The answer I keep coming back to is yeah, just alchemical bullshit, we have magic, but I’ve also looked into historically how it’s done, and there’s various herbs and diet changes that can result in minor changes. In an MtF direction, it’s pretty easy to get any given hormone into your system, it’s reducing ones you don’t want that is tricky. There are small concoctions and dietary changes that could have been made, and I imagine some of those happen in fantasy settings, and probably a little bit of Blades in the Dark, because medical practice is a lot more hearsay and less codified, an di imagine more things are willing to be tried.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: And like, the hormone pills we have now come from somewhere, so it shouldn’t be too hard to get the components and produce something similar alchemically. There’s also just surgery-wise, that’s historically been done, not in a totally reconstructive way. At least in an MtF direction there are certain removal processes you can do. I’m thinking Minx is not there with that, and is just kind of on alchemical potion hormones.
Rhi: Yeah. My goal with the way that I’m running Blades has been to have it be also sort of a more generally gender fluid society.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, I feel like people being trans or non-binary or gender fluid… it’s only a big deal in that it’s “oh, okay, this is how I need to address you now, and I will respect that as part of your identity.”
Madge: It’s more accepted than it is in our current society, basically.
Rhi: Yeah. For that reason, I think that a lot of the medical stuff, transition things, alchemical potions, that is pretty well researched and readily available, because there are people who want to take advantage of it, so it is made available.
Madge: Yeah!
Rhi: I will also mention, it hasn’t come up specifically in game, but both Kay and Amancio are trans as well as Minx.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: I remember also we had a non-binary adversary at some combat.
Rhi: Oh, yeah! Arun, the alchemist that you all framed.
[laughter]
Madge: I also know that Phin, in her backstory, she learned a lot about how to fight back against oppressive people from Chael who is also non-binary.
Rhi: Yes. Yes.
Josie: Aw.
Rhi: Chael hasn’t really had a lot of screen time yet. We gotta…
Madge: We gotta fix that.
Rhi: Yeah. Season 2 goal. Yeah, thank you for asking that. That’s something that I’ve had in the back of my head but haven’t really had the chance to discuss too much.
Josie: Same here. Yeah, this setting is trans as shit.
Kim: That’s the beauty of Blades in general. It can be almost literally whatever you want. It is so light on the details in the rulebook that you can fill in the gaps however you’d like for almost anything.
Several: Mm-hmm.
Minna: One thing I like is that Rhi made the house rule that there’s no transphobia, misogyny, homophobia, all of those, asephobia. None of that, none of that shit, because that’s not fun.
Kim: Because those are all things that are important to all of us and us as a group, and something that we definitely want to convey in the show, so that’s just a house rule we decided on because that’s where our morals lie, if you can’t already tell by this point in the show.
Rhi: Yeah, if you hadn’t noticed. [laughs] I made that decision really deliberately even before I started recruiting players. That was just something I didn’t want. There’s a tendency, particularly in darker settings like Blades, to lean on those sort of –isms and –phobias and what not as a way of showing like…
Madge: [emphatically] It’s dark, it’s gritty, nothing is safe! And I’m SO sick of that. It’s tired.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s just like, you don’t have to do that. That’s not necessary. You can show the darkness and struggle of the setting without it being built upon the prejudices that we have in the real world.
Kim: Exactly.
Madge: Cough, cough, altered carbon, cough, cough.
Rhi & Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: The other thing is that, sort of pulling from the setting, the main religious, quote unquote “religious organization” in the setting is literally called the Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh, which is premised on the idea that the body and the physical is sacred and that the pursuit of physical pleasure in whatever form, sex, good food, drugs, drink, comfortable clothes, whatever, is like…
Madge: Holy.
Rhi: …paramount. Yeah. That is a sacred thing to pursue. So yeah, nobody’s gonna be judging you for the body that you have, or the body that you want to have, or the people that you are touching bodies with. [laughter] Or not. You know? As long as you are doing things that are good for your physical body and other people’s bodies, sure. Go for it. It’s all good.
Kim: This is a tangent, but that springs from the fact that in this world of Blades that the afterlife and the supernatural is all viewed as very evil and chaotic and stuff, and that’s why I think it’s so interesting that the people of Duskwall really celebrate the physical world, because not only is it temporary but it’s so precious to them, because afterwards everybody knows that they’re probably gonna go to a horrible place when they die.
Rhi: Yeah. They’re gonna become a ghost and try to eat people’s faces.
Madge: Until they get disintegrated by The Spirit Wardens.
Rhi: Yeah.
Madge: Also on the topic of sexual and gender diversity, I think it’s also been great that on the show we’ve seen a huge variety in the types of people that The Magpies run into. We’ve had people who speak sign language, we’ve had people who obviously don’t fit into the standard straight, white male prototype that seems to really permeate, in steampunk especially. I like how we’re getting far further from that, and I like how we’re changing the typical stories that are told, or at least the leads in those stories. I think it’s super important. In the actual play podcast community in general it’s very white dudes saving the world a lot of the time. One of the things that drew me to the project especially once we got started was it felt like… You know the Sherlock Holmes movies?
Kim: The Robert Downey Jr. ones?
Madge: Yeah, those ones. It feels a lot like that tonally sometimes, but it’s not Robert Downey Jr. in the lead role. [laughs] It’s queer women!
Several: Yeah!
Madge: Which is amazing.
Kim: I think that’s a perfect metaphor for the setting. It very much looks like the RDJ Sherlock Holmes.
Minna: I’ve literally used that as my music for this.
Madge: So it’s like that, and then Six of Crows, and Crooked Kingdom all together, but with the diversity of those books, and then turned up a notch as well.
Rhi: Yeah. I will say, I talked about this when I was on I Am Here when I did an interview on that podcast, but in terms of the NPCs – I have it open right now. I literally have a spreadsheet of the main named NPCs that you all have run into, and I have occupation, residence, if I do anything particular with their voice, stuff like that, but I also have what is their gender, are they a person of color, what is their sexuality, do they have a disability? It’s a good way for me to kind of track patterns. I can say okay, I haven’t done as good a job as I would like on having trans and non-binary characters, and disabled characters as well, so that’s something I want to step up in Season 2 is to make sure that I am including more representation of those people. I think we’re all very consciously trying to make sure that – like Madge said – that this is not straight, white, cis dude territory.
Josie: I gotta say, I have enjoyed just finally being in an RPG where more than half the cast including the PCs is female or non-male.
Madge: Yeah, it’s been super refreshing.
Josie: I’m in so many other gaming spaces where that’s not the case.
Madge: Yeah. I’ve been in a lot of places where I’ve been in games with three other guys, and I’m the only girl, and those games…
Minna: Yeah. I don’t like being the only girl.
Madge: It’s really uncomfortable.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s not fun.
Madge: Being the only non-male identifying person in a group gets really stressful. One of the games I was in, my character started out as the genius character who was supposed to help out with stuff, and by the end she got turned into a side character for an NPC, a male NPC, as his love interest who’s only thing had to do with losing him, and it was not great by the end of it, and I’m glad that this is not that.
[groans and grumbles]
Minna: Ick.
Rhi: Yeah. I think we’ve all had pretty unpleasant experiences with that.
Minna: I’m like really new to doing RP in spaces like this that are heavily male. I’m using to heavily non-male, because I came from internet roleplay. I actually played a lot of dudes after a while, and I don’t play dudes almost at all anymore because I just want to make sure that I’m pushing more women characters into it.
Madge: Which I think is a really big difference just between written roleplay and actual tabletop, because that’s where I got my start too, on Fake Geek Girls a while ago. I don’t know if they’re still doing it, but when it was going I was on the show and I talked about how that’s how I got my start too, was a lot of text RP and going with that. It’s way different.
Minna: Maybe that’s why we all so readily fic.
Madge: Yeah. It’s a huge difference, because that is a very female dominated space, a non-male dominated space. You get into tabletop and it’s like, why are all these guys here? [laughs] Like, no offense to guys, obviously, but like…
Kim: Yeah, there are some good eggs out there, and props to you if you are.
Madge: Yeah. The good eggs in my life know who they are because I tell them they’re good eggs constantly, but when you’re in a space for long enough you start seeing the patterns of the guys that you want to avoid, because they’re gonna turn into Those Guys, capital T, capital G.
Kim: Right.
Minna: [laughing] We got on a giant sidebar.
Madge: We did!
Rhi: That’s okay! It’s okay.
Kim: It did get away from us, but I’m liking this conversation.
Minna: It’s very important.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s a good, good conversation.
Josie: Digression is always great.
Madge: Remember when we said we weren’t gonna talk for more than an hour answering questions? [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I was gonna say—Just so we don’t end up with this being two hours…
## [0:32:37]
Another question that was sent in from our good friend Waffles, who we all love…
Kim: Hi Waffles! They make us fan art, and it’s great.
Madge: Yeah!
Kim: Show them some love.
Rhi: Yes. So, @Mahaffay asks: Who are all of the PC’s rivals, and how did they get to be frenemies?
Who wants to start with that?
Josie: I think the one that may have been most prominent so far is me and Bazso. This was gone over in one of the episodes, but Minx, Bazso, and Nyryx all grew up together, and were kind of like urchins together, and in their late teens-ish, or not too long before this, they were going their own separate ways a little bit, and then Bazso and Minx were on a job together, and Minx essentially had the choice of helping Bazso not get sent to prison and getting away with loot, which I think we established was the four-poster bed she still has, [laughter] and just having money to get started for herself, because that’s kind of her driving force. She went with the bed [laughs], and Bazso spent time in Iron Hook, so that wasn’t very cool of her.
Madge: Nooo. [chuckles]
Josie: This is probably 100% her fault, although Bazso is not the man I thought he was.
Rhi: Yeah. Bazso is definitely holding a grudge there. Minna, you wanna go next?
Minna: Yes. The rival on my sheet is Salia, which I think we touched on her a little bit in Season 1. Basically Myra was her apprentice – this is nothing that’s not in her bio on the website – Myra was her apprentice, learned a lot from her, but it wasn’t a great environment to be in. I think she eventually just wanted autonomy basically, so she struck out on her own, and Salia was not too happy about that. So yeah, she’s her rival. She can still draw on her, she just won’t enjoy drawing on that resource.
Rhi: Yeah, because it’s gonna come with a lot of hooks and caveats.
Minna: A lot of strings attached.
Rhi: Madge?
Madge: Yeah. On her playbook, one of the people that she doesn’t quite get along with is Mercy who is a stone cold killer, but I think canonically in terms of what’s going on currently in the campaign, her nemesis is more Lord Alistair Mora. Just a recap of what happened in the finale, when Phin first got into the life, basically, of going on the streets and beating people up she started doing that because Alistair Mora was paying for criminal gangs to terrorize The Docks and basically extort people for money, which goes against a lot of who Phin is as a person. She is very much a person who wants everyone to be taken care of and believes that no one should have to live in fear of a higher power coming and kicking in their door and demanding that they get paid money that they worked hard to earn, especially if said money gets spent later on for the projects that Alistair Mora is currently working on. The reason why they don’t get along so well is because Phin and Chael teamed up and pushed the gangs out of The Docks, which is also in her bio I think. So, that’s her nemesis, and he’s got the upper hand on her right now.
Rhi: Yeah. Yup. Blaire? Blaire’s nemesis?
Kim: On Blaire’s character sheet her rival is Flint the spirit trafficker, and I wouldn’t even go so far as to say they’re frenemies. I think they exclusively detest each other. I don’t think he’s come up as much in game.
Rhi: Yeah, he was in a couple episodes a while back.
Minna: We stole some shit from him, right?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, and I think framed him for something.
Kim: That sounds right.
Madge: Yeah, we definitely framed him for something.
Kim: But yeah, they haven’t really interacted much because Blaire just hates him, and all spirit traffickers, so much, because she thinks that someone’s consciousness being ground up into drugs and being exploited and sold for someone else’s pleasure is just absolutely abhorrent.
## [0:37:14]
Rhi: I like this question because it makes all of you tell me which of my children you love best.
From @magicalgirlkyra: Who are your favorite NPCs to interact with?
Josie: Oof.
Minna: Ahh. Can we just collectively say, just right off the top, Rigney?
Madge: Yeah, Rigney, I was gonna say Rigney.
Kim: I was gonna say, Rigney’s my favorite.
Minna: Team dad.
Josie: Yeah. Yeah. I was about to say this is hard, but like, yeah it’s Rigney.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: I feel like we get Rigney out of the way and then we each have another favorite.
Rhi: Good. Everyone loves my good dad friend.
Minna: He’s so good.
Josie: He’s a good boy.
Rhi: Yeah, Rigney’s a good egg. But yeah, who else do you like? This also helps me so that I know who to bring back more. [laughs]
Kim: I don’t remember her name, but Blaire’s friend from college who dressed like the gothic Lolita girl. I loved her.
Minna: Aw! She’s the one who doesn’t want to be friends with us!
Rhi: Yeah. That’s Adelaide, who is nobility, who’s not gonna be around anymore unfortunately. Which is such a shame, because yeah, she was great. I really liked her. Unfortunately you two have gone in separate directions in that she is rich and you want to kill the rich, so it’s a little awkward.
Kim: I mean, I also like Ghost Sword. I’ll put that out there.
Madge: Oh, Sawtooth. I just personally think there could have been something with Phin and Sawtooth at some point that just never got touched on with them just bickering with each other so much. Also, I just love how put upon Sawtooth is all the time.
Minna: Also, isn’t he scruffy Tom Hardy?
Rhi: Yes.
Madge: [laughing] Yes! That doesn’t factor into this at all!
Kim: That’s right! We did face cast him as Tom Hardy. I forgot about that.
Rhi: Hey, I mean, he’s not gone. He can come back.
Madge: He can come back. Also, I really loved the police officers that I argued with while I was spying on The Red Sashes.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah, that as very good.
Josie: You’re horrible.
Madge: You’re horrible. [laughs]
Rhi: Josie?
Josie: I really enjoy Lani and Roxanne.
Madge: Oh, they’re good too.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: Yeah, my girls.
Josie: I think they’re great. They’re good girls, and I want them to be okay.
Rhi: Yeah. They’re good. They’re gonna figure stuff out.
Madge: And Kay!
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Yeah. Uh-huh. I mean, I’m too gay to not have her on the list.
Minna: Teehee. Oh, it’s hard to choose… I’m between—I mean, I have to say Jeren, because he’s like Myra’s other best friend, and also I really enjoy them. I think I kind of dropped him in your lap, didn’t I? Oh, no, he’s on my sheet, but then I made up a whole backstory with him and Myra. Also, Bazso Baz is really fun, and a direct attack on me at all points.
Rhi: [giggles] Not intentional, but here we are.
Minna: I know! He’s just… For some reason people play him as exactly the kind of character who’s a direct attack on me, and this has happened with multiple different GMs independently. As a note, super aro/ase, still really like Bazso Baz. Very good.
Rhi: In the season finale, I was just editing the part where—
Minna: Was it the part where he came in with a cut on his forehead, and I died?!
Rhi: Yeah. The cut on his forehead, and Minna makes this pained—
Minna: [laughing] Did I audibly die?
Rhi: Yeah. There was an audible, pained gurgling noise. It was pretty great.
Minna: No~! [laugh/whines] Look! He’s just very good~!
Kim: Any male NPC over the age of 40 is always definitely an attack on me, also.
Rhi: Yeah. I have to be careful about that.
Kim: Just due to who I am as a person.
## [41:02]
Rhi: So, also from @magicalgirlkyra: How have your characters changed since the start of the game?
Kim: I feel as though Blaire hasn’t really changed too much yet in Season 1. Season 2 should change that. We’re gonna get a little bit deeper into the character arc I have planned for her. Blaire has changed in the fact that throughout all of Season 1 I’ve mentally been developing her. Her personality has kind of been fluid in that I’ve kind of been figuring out who she is as I play her, and it’s very… She’s a very improvisational character. Visually as well, it took me all of Season 1, so almost a year, for me to figure out what she looked like visually for me to draw her for the character portraits on our website. There are lots of sketches on my computer and in my sketchbook of me just figuring out what the heck she looks like, which is very rare for me, because as an artist and a visual person the way characters look is usually one of the first things I figure out, because that usually helps me to inform what kind of person this is. That wasn’t the case for Blaire, and that was something that was unique for me. I wouldn’t say Blaire has changed so much as much as she’s kind of developed baseline who she is throughout Season 1. Now that I feel like she has a bit of a foundation, now we can go more into how she’s going to grow, and that’s exciting for me.
Josie: I feel like Minx is one of the very few characters I’ve played who didn’t change radically from conception to execution, which I guess is kind of the point because a very put-together façade is part of her. She’s still a very “me” character, and if you’ve played with me you know what that fucking means, but… [others laugh]. I think the biggest change was starting when she killed Winfield, because that was kind of a spur of the moment thing. I wasn’t expecting her to be so angry. I was originally intending her to be even more problematic with wanting to be rich and shit like that, but that put a more sympathetic edge to it I guess, and that just kind of happened spur of the moment.
Madge: Phin changed a little bit from how I first envisioned her. I play a lot of tanks, just in general in roleplaying games. She started out as a brute force tank who didn’t really have much driving her in this life besides the fact that she pushed out a gang once and doesn’t want it to happen to anyone ever again. A lot of me being quiet was also me figuring out who Phin was, because similarly I had an idea but I didn’t really know how to translate that, and that eventually transitioned into Phin’s actual character traits of her not speaking up unless she knows that she can trust a person, or knows that she can get along with them.
Minna: Augh.
Madge: Arc-wise, I think she’s gone from someone who cares about a neighborhood to someone who cares about an entire city.
Kim: Aw.
Madge: Specifically she cares about The Magpies, and the whole family that she’s built there. Obviously she has her own family, and it’s a big one, but The Magpies are close to her in her family and it’s a completely different relationship even though they don’t talk as much, which will also be changing in Season 2 because she’s gonna have to talk about the fact that she was in prison!
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Please. We love you. Talk to us.
Minna: Please, please talk about it, instead of balling it up like the trauma.
Madge: [flatly] Yeah.
[laughter]
Minna: Myra definitely started out as a loner before The magpies, and we’ve kind of seen her warm up and start to really care about these people. I think a lot changed when we decided that Myra and Phin had started The Magpies together and that they’d known each other longest, because that friendship has really developed and I’m really happy that happened, because I didn’t know whether to expect that, and that’s been a really nice thing that’s come about throughout the course of the show.
Madge: Yeah. [giggles]
Minna: And then she’s starting to get closer to the others, and it’s very good.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that has been one of my favorite things through Season 1, watching the crew go from a group of people who get along and are working together to becoming this really tight-knit group that really cares about each other a lot. It’s been very good. Found family, man.
Minna: I get called out by Ammo about the found family trope. [laughter] Like, I should have known because you love it, but…
Rhi: It’s good! It’s good!
Kim: I think we’re all suckers for it in this group. It’s something that we all love in stories.
Minna: It’s very good, and it really fits with the story that we’re telling, I think.
## [0:45:59]
Rhi: Going from how The magpies came together to how the podcast came together, @BadWitchMills asks:
Josie: Hi Sarah!
Rhi: How did you all go about forming the RP group?
I guess I can talk about that a little. I had the idea for several months that I wanted to do a Blades in the Dark podcast, because I had the opportunity to run Blades a couple times online, a little bit for my in-person group of friends here in Chicago, and I had this big Google doc with plans of here’s what I need to do to get the show going, and these are all of the accounts I need to sign up for, and all of these very detailed plans… but Step 1 was you need to find people to actually play the game.
[giggling]
Minna: No, really?
Rhi: So, what I did was I put together a Google form that had a whole bunch of questions ranging from “When are you available?” to “What is your RPG style?” I think we’ve all been in gaming groups where you’ve had a few people who want to do really story driven stuff, you’ve had people who want to do the very mechanics focused stuff, you have people who just want to cause mayhem, and if you don’t get everybody on the same page it’s a problem. I wanted to make sure that everybody would kind of be in line with the kind of narrative that I wanted to do. God, what else? I think I asked about recording experience. I asked a lot of stuff. It was a long form. [laughs]
Madge: Yeah, you did. I remember that form.
Minna: Recording experience, RPG experience…
Madge: Systems that you’d played before…
Rhi: Yeah, it was a lot. I asked a lot of questions.
Minna: You mentioned prioritizing marginalized identities, I think.
Rhi: Yes, yeah, one of the questions – it was an optional one – Hey, if you fall into any of these more marginalized groups, and you feel comfortable with it, let me know, because I want to highlight that.
Josie: And we ended up with four queer girls, so that’s great.
Rhi: Yup. [laughs] So yeah, that’s how I ended up with this group. I made that form, I sent it out in a ton of places, I got a lot of responses. I got like over 30 responses, that I was then sitting there like oh God, I have to sort through this. What have I done?
Madge: I remember you contacting me really shortly after I had submitted my form and asking me about it.
Rhi: Yeah, I think yours came in a couple days before I closed it, and then I reviewed everything, and I made my choices, and I’m really happy with it.
Minna: I remember being so nervous.
Rhi: Aw!
Kim: Rhi and I personally have been friends for a very long time, an di feel as though I may have been among the first people you approached about interest in the game. I vaguely remember you talking to me about you planning a podcast before you even put that form out, and I was way into it.
Rhi: Yeah. I had been in another RP group at the time that was kind of like, the game at that point was sort of falling apart, but I shared it with that group first because well I know these people and I’ve played with them before, and Kim was the only person from that group who applied. But yeah, I also kind of went for people who I had gamed with before, because that also sort of helped where I knew what your gaming style was like.
Madge: Yeah, you knew how we would react.
Rhi: But yeah, that’s how the group came together. I basically recruited people, and I’m really happy with it. I’m very glad that this is the group we have and the characters that we have.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Kim: I’m happy with this group too. I love you guys.
Minna: Also the friendships that have developed since then.
Madge: Yeah, it’s been really great.
Kim: Yeah. I definitely feel as though I’ve gotten closer to a lot of you since we’ve started.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah, I don’t think I was like “friends” friends with maybe any of you before this started. I got closer to like all of you after.
Madge: Minna, remember how we didn’t even think that we could talk to each other about fan fiction before, until like half way through Season 1? [laughs]
Minna: Oh my God! Now we can just plot in the background and pull shit off. [laughs]
Madge: Yeah. Personally, when this whole thing was starting out I was really self-conscious about it, because I had been involved in another actual play podcast. It fell apart due to some difficulties between the GM and the players, and I was really nervous about getting involved with an actual play again, because I didn’t know what to expect, I didn’t know what it would be like going in from the start knowing that everything was going to be recorded, which is why I waited so long to actually submit anything. After Session 0 with everybody I sort of had the feeling that this was gonna be a good group, and I’m really glad that everything’s worked out how it has.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Kim: Yeah. I’m really glad you took that leap of faith. You’re a great addition to the group.
Minna: Me too~
Josie: Yeah!
## 0:51:12]
Rhi: Another question we have from @Krysmphoenix asks: Are Minx and Kay (buff Gondolier lady) still seeing each other?
Josie: Yeah. It was my understanding that it was mostly just for fun. Neither of them have plans of making a relationship out of it, but booty calls are on the table.
Rhi: Yeah, and I think because with Minx and Nyryx—Josie, I don’t know if we’ve ever formally talked about this, but my understanding has been that it’s an on-again off-again relationship, and even when they are on it’s still an open relationship.
Josie: Uh, yeah, that makes sense.
Rhi: At least in terms of sexual partners, simply by virtue of Nyryx’s job.
Josie: Well yeah.
Rhi: And yes, Kay was always kind of going into that with Minx with the understanding of this is fun, it’s casual, it’s not ever gonna turn into a relationship. So in the background they may still be seeing each other in the future as a casual thing, but particularly right now…
Madge: Yeah, it’s not a good time for lovers.
Josie: yeah.
Rhi: And also Minx and Nyryx are on again, so Minx’s attention is probably more in that direction at this point.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But yeah, that’s kind of the nature of their relationship with Minx and Kay. Yeah, Kay’s good, I like her.
Madge: Kay is a good egg. I love her so much.
## [0:52:52]
Rhi: All right. For our last audience question we are gonna go with…
@Hazel_da_Basil asks: Where did the name The Magpies come from?
We kind of have two answers, we’ve got the out of character and the in character answers. Out of character—
Madge: You asked us what our name was gonna be and that was gonna be the name of the podcast.
Rhi: [laughing] Yes! Yeah. I had been sitting here like, coming up with names for things—
Madge: It’s hard.
Rhi: –as you’ve probably gathered by this point, I have a really hard time with, so I explicitly told the group okay, we’ve built your characters, we’ve built the crew sheet, you guys need to come up with a name for the crew… by the way, the name of your crew is also probably gonna be the name of the podcast, and everyone was like uhh, okay thanks!
[laughter]
Madge: And we eventually got to The magpies, and it stuck, because we also thought about leaving the pins too.
Minna: Magpies steal shiny things.
Kim: Yeah. We were originally planning to start as a group of thieves.
Madge: And then we never stole anything ever.
Josie: Turns out we were very bad at that.
Rhi: [laughs] What I recall was there’s a special ability on the Shadow’s sheet that is like Pack Rats? You just have a ton of stuff in the lair, and you guys thought about taking that one, you decided not to take it initially and took a different special ability, but you were very enamored with the idea…
Madge: Yeah, of having it be Ghibli cozy.
Rhi: …of having it be oh we just steal a bunch of stuff and fill our hideout with it.
Minna: I mean, that is how we furnished it initially. That’s how we got our enemy at the beginning. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, and then you guys have turned out to be the worst thieves in the world.
Kim: The worst criminals in the world, really.
Madge: Yeah…
Kim: We’re very bad at being bad.
Josie: We’re too good of people for this.
Minna: We’re the worst criminals you’ve ever heard of, but you HAVE heard of us.
Madge: [simultaneously] You HAVE heard of us.
Minna: We really made sure of that.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah, flinging your pins around everywhere. Madge, you were gonna talk about where it came from.
Madge: Yeah. Part of the question is also about who formed The Magpies, and the answer to that is that Myra and Phin formed The Magpies after they worked together on a job and it went really well, and they decided to just see where it went. I think The Magpies, specifically them deciding to call themselves magpies came after they stole all that furniture from The Gray Cloaks.
Rhi: [laughs] yeah!
Madge: So, we stayed in The Gray Cloaks’ hotel thing that they have going on, and instead of just staying for the night and being on with their lives, they stole every single bit of furniture out of their hotel rooms and moved it over to their place, in The Nest, which wasn’t called The Nest at the time, but they moved all the furniture over there and just said it’s ours now.
[laughter]
Minna: I feel like one thing this crew excels at is branding.
Kim: Branding is consistency. That’s what I was taught in art school.
Madge: Yep. I think that’s when they officially became The Magpies, at that point, because I feel like up until then they were just playing around with different names and nothing stuck.
Minna: Who got/made the pins? Where did the pins come from?!
Madge: It definitely wasn’t from Phin, because she doesn’t have that kind of flair.
Josie: I feel like it’s Minx.
Kim: I was gonna say, it feels like a Minx thing.
Madge: Yeah, it had to have been Minx.
Josie (as Minx): We need to have some style about this, dears.
Minna: Yes!
Kim: We need to have a call sign.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: I love that.

Rhi: I think that’s pretty much gonna wrap it up for our Season 1 Q&A feelings episode. In two weeks, tune in for the start of Season 2.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: Yes! And a very exciting announcement about how you will be able to support the show. For now, keep listening to hear some highlights from our Season 1 blooper reel. Thank you all so much for listening. We appreciate every comment and tweet and like that we get. It means the world to us.
## Bloopers [57:13
Rhi: For these pilot episodes—
Madge: Can we not die?
Rhi: Uh… Well, yeah. I’m not gonna kill you guys, this early.
Madge: [laughs]
Rhi: I mean, if you do something really catastrophically stupid I might not be able to help you, but…
Madge: Challenge accepted.
—
Rhi: One of you is gonna have to say something quickly, because ghosts typically are not friendly. Blaire thinks they’re friendly. They’re not friendly.
Kim (as Blaire): [sweetly] They’re friends.
Minna: [excited “so cute” noise]
Josie: Aww!
Rhi: No, they are hungry for your life essence.
—
Rhi (as Kay): If you’re trying to setup an ambush, that’s a good plan. The only problem is they don’t usually attack me.
Kim (as Blaire): Why not you?
Rhi: She looks at Blaire, which is looking down a significant amount, and she just kind of raises an eyebrow.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi (as Kay): [dryly] I don’t know. It must be my sparkling personality.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): [hesitantly] Okay…
Rhi: [laughs] The six foot tall, incredibly muscular woman who could easily bench press any of you, says. Well, maybe not easily with Phin, but…
Madge: [laughs]
—
Rhi: [laughing] It’s like 12 swords.
Josie: Oh, it’s like 12 swords? Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a lot.
Kim: That is… That is not a lot.
Josie: I’m not looking for a collection of swords.
Madge: It’s not enough!"

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. And welcome to Season Two. We have a lot of news and announcements to get through today, so stick with us. First, I am thrilled to announce that we have a Patreon. The Magpies is a project of love, but right now we’re limited in what we can do with the show by how much money I can invest in it. By supporting us on Patreon, you’ll be helping us to do even more, and get some pretty great rewards in the process.
For example, for just $2 a month, you get access to our secret archive, which currently contains the full, 33 minute Season One blooper reel. And later this month, we will be posting two full pre-series episodes. Higher tiers get to submit NPCs or Devil’s Bargains, get Magpies-inspired tabletop content for their home games, or, at the highest level of support, get a personal Blades in the Dark game with me as the GM. We have a lot of exciting goals, too. Livestreams, episode transcripts, better recording equipment, and so much more. Visit patreon.com/magpiespodcast and check it out. There will be a link in the show notes, as well as on literally every other Magpies website on the internet.
Second, as you can probably tell from my croaky voice, I am recording this the day after getting home from AcadeCon. I had an amazing time and met so many fans. I’m not sure I’ll ever get used to hearing people they recognise my voice from the podcast, but it’s pretty cool. And meeting fans in person is always awesome. I want to give a special shout out to Dakota, aka @punchvestigate, who made an incredible woodcut version of our logo that I am going to treasure forever. There’s a picture of it on our Twitter feed. Go check it out, it’s amazing.
Third, Iron Hides, the weird west monster-of-the-week podcast starring Minna and Madge, among other friends, premiers on the one-shot network this Thursday. Go give them some support, and a really kick-ass launch day.
A couple notes about today’s episode. First, it’s another roleplay-only episode. The players wanted to explore some of the scenes and conversations that happen in the aftermath of the riots and Phin’s arrest. So, rather than glossing over this time period, we recorded a lot of really great character interactions and moments.
Second, I do need to give a bit of warning for one of those scenes, and for an arc that will be playing out in the future. Blaire’s relationship with Setarra is going to become more and more toxic, getting into emotional abuse territory at times. This is a narrative that the group had discussed as a whole and that Kim wants to explore with Blaire. But I recognise that this could be difficult listening for someone who has dealt with, or it still dealing with, similar abuse. For that reason, I’ll include a content warning in front of all the episodes, which includes this one, that deal with the subject.
Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Kim: Of the seven species of sea turtle that call our Earth home, all are either endangered or threatened. Things like pollution, climate change, overfishing and boat propellers put these beautiful animals at risk of disappearing for good. The South Carolina aquarium is home to the state’s only sea turtle hospital, where they rescue, rehabilitate, and then release sick and injured turtles. And the way they accept donations is pretty unique. The aquarium provides public access to the hospital’s Amazon wishlist, where you can shop for supplies that will aid their cause. Whether you gift be as humble as a pack of gauze, or as extravagant as a new water filter, I promise there is something there you can give that fits every budget. A link to the hospital’s wishlist will be provided in the show notes, and if you don’t wish to support the aquarium through Amazon, donations can be made directly through their website as well. Please consider helping sea turtles in need and being a part of giving these animals a fighting chance at survival.
Rhi: If you have a few dollars to spare, please consider donating. I’ve spent the last few months imploring our American listeners to vote out the Republicans in government. Last Tuesday was election night and while the results are still being counted and coming in, there were a lot of really strong gains. Over 100 women, including many queer women and women of colour, were elected to the House of Representatives, which the Democrats now control. There were significant Democratic gains in state governments as well. Now, we need to make sure that these newly elected officials do everything they can to curtail and investigate the Trump administration and the GOP agenda, as well as combat corruption and expand voting rights.
That last one is crucial. Democrats at the federal level are unlikely to achieve much on that front; they control only one chamber of Congress. But, as we saw in Michigan and Florida, significant gains can be made at the state level. So call your governors, your state reps and stare senators, do whatever you can. Volunteer, sign petitions, donate and protest. We need to ensure that more people can vote fairly and safely by 2020. And of course, continue to visit 5calls.org for tips on calling your representatives about immediate issues facing the country.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## Season One Recap [00:05:41]
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. Over the last several months, The Magpies have become one of the more notorious gangs in the city. From their first job for a pair of investigative journalists at the North Hook Mirror, Phin, Blaire, Minx and Myra have tangled with the corrupt Bluecoats, the supposedly disbanded Umbra Hunters, and the secretive, powerful, Circle of Flame. They stole arcane artefacts from a halted cargo ship, robbed the Iruvian embassy, infiltrated a black market auction, survived The Deathlands, and through it all forged a bond of friendship and family that it seemed nothing could break. Their investigation of The Circle of Flame eventually brought them to the elite Centuralia Club, as they searched for information about missing servants. They uncovered dark rituals and human sacrifices, all in the name of bringing The Circle more power. Everything came to a head when Phin, aided by Myra, murdered Iruvian ambassador and Circle of Flame member Elstera Avrathi in retribution for the lives The Circle had taken.
In response, and to prevent the records and information The Magpies had stolen from going public, The Circle burned down the North Hook Mirror’s office, along with much of the surrounding district. Immediately after, Lord Alistair Mora and the Duskwall City Council put forth their plan to build a factory and worker tenements on the site, taking advantage of the tragedy. The Magpies vowed to stop this from happening. The rallied both the people displaced by the fire and the spirits killed by it and began a massive riot. With the help of questionable allies The Lampblacks and Setarra the sea demon, they drove back the Bluecoats and Spirit Wardens. But their victory was not without cost. The Lampblacks took over the refugee site, crushing any alliance between The Magpies and the people they’d helped, and Phin, already wanted for the murder of Avrathi, was arrested and sent to Iron Hook prison. The remaining Magpies must now survive a war with The Circle of Flame, while missing one of their founding members. Will their choice to become vigilantes, defenders of Duskwall’s poor and desperate, be their undoing? Or will they somehow be the ones to bring change and justice to the city? Let’s find out, shall we?
## Story Continues [00:08:27]
Rhi: We open up on The Nest. It is a rainy day in Duskwall. Streets seem darker and gloomier than normal, not a lot of people outside. Inside, though, it’s fairly warm and homey. The three of you are sitting around a table, having dinner, and there’s a notably empty fourth chair at a spot at the table where there’s a bunch of, like, you know, scratch marks and knife stabs in the wood. Just sort of a quiet, awkward day about three or four days after the riots and Phin’s arrest.
Josie (as Minx): So, um, Blaire, dear?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm?
Josie (as Minx): Um, what exactly-, who’s your friend that helped us out?
Kim (as Blaire): What friend?
Josie (as Minx): You know, the rather fiendish looking woman who took down a small squadron by herself?
Kim (as Blaire): Ohhh. That friend.
Josie (as Minx): I assume a friend, I hope a friend.
Kim (as Blaire): Um…well. Her name is Setarra.
Josie (as Minx): Uh huh.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, you know I was asking for a bit more than that.
Kim (as Blaire): Um…
Minna (as Myra): She isn’t human, is she?
Kim (as Blaire): No. She’s not human.
Josie (as Minx): So what is she? I thought your specialty was ghosts.
Kim (as Blaire): Well what do you think she is?
Josie (as Minx): Given her similar features, it seems… she’s very clearly a demon, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes! Setarra is a demon.
Josie (as Minx): And why, pray tell, were you able to simply call a demon to our aid? Not that I’m not thankful–
Kim (as Blaire): Because I know her, okay, just…
Kim: And Blaire is like, Blaire’s starting to pout, she’s very visibly uncomfortable.
Josie and Minna: Aww.
Kim: This is a hot-button issue apparently.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, I don’t mean to chastise you, I’m not your mother, but this does seem like the sort of thing that could put the crew in danger, potentially.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s not. I’ve got it under control.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, for the time being that seems to be the case, but, any particular reason you didn’t share this?
Kim (as Blaire): Because I knew you’d, like, people would think that. Setarra is the reason that I got expelled.
Minna (as Myra): Oh. What happened?
Kim (as Blaire): I just spent a long time in the library one night, and I brought it back to my room, and I don’t know, I just, I figured out how to summon her. And she- there’s so little out there written about demons, it’s just, I thought I’d be able to learn.
Minna (as Myra): And that’s an admirable thing. Have you been talking to Setarra all this time?
Kim (as Blaire): On and off.
Josie (as Minx): Has she been in The Nest?
Kim (as Blaire): No! No, I never summon her in The Nest. I go outside for that.
Josie (as Minx): All right, well, that’s responsible at the very least. I know, for myself, I’m not upset at your propensity to learn, but you saw what she is capable of, you understand our worry.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, yes, but that’s why I brought her. Like, we were going to lose otherwise. I had to do something; I thought she’d be able to help because we’re friends.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, I don’t blame you for anything. I just care about all of you and want to make sure everyone’s safe.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m safe.
Josie: Can I give Blaire a hug? This is not how Minx was expecting it to go. She’s so precious.
Kim: I mean, you might want to roll for it. I don’t know if, not to backseat GM or anything, but I don’t know if she’s in the hugging mood.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, no, that’s, yeah. I mean, this is probably Consort.
Josie. Sure, all right. No. I got a three.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Yeah. I think Minx tries to, like, scoot closer for it. Minx is already feeling pretty guilty about, like, putting Blaire on the spot. But, I imagine Blaire is just, super pout mood.
Kim: She is ultra, über, pout mode right now. But as soon as she notices Minx scooting closer she is just gonna stiffen up, she squares her shoulders, her fists, like, tighten. They clench at her sides and she gives, just like, giving off very strong ‘do not touch me’ vibes.
Josie: Minx will back off then.
Josie (as Minx): Again, sorry for the interrogation but–
Kim (as Blaire): No, it’s fine. You wanted to know about her, so… surprise! I’m friends with a demon. Can we stop talking about it now?
Minna (as Myra): Has she asked anything of you?
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean?
Minna (as Myra): Help from people who are more powerful usually comes at a price. I’m assuming that works with demons as much as humans.
Kim (as Blaire): No, she hasn’t asked me for anything. If anything, she’s been helping me.
Minna (as Myra): Do you know why?
Kim (as Blaire): No. I don’t. I know it’s like a complicated thing, demons are obviously very powerful and whatnot, but people are always so quick to dismiss them as being bad people. And it’s just, we don’t know if that’s the truth because everybody’s too afraid to study them or get to know them.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I suppose that could be true. But you understand that we worry, you doing that by yourself. We are a crew for the purposes of backing each other up, yes?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): So, simply from our perspective, you’re talking to an unknown, powerful entity with unknown motives, who may very well be a good person, and who may very well be not, and is involved, however tangentially, in our business. And given the nature of your studies, it can be dangerous. Just, everything you do, really.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I’m equipped to handle this kind of stuff though. Demons, like, I dunno, maybe a little less so, but I’m learning. I’m gonna figure out how to handle this. And I don’t know if she’s good good, I don’t think any demons are, like, quote unquote ‘good’, but…
Minna (as Myra): I mean, that’s all well and good, but people are-, there’s usually a price with them as well, you know, I’m not worrying just on the fact that she’s a demon. Although that is pretty worrying to me. Although I accept that you know more about this than I do.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. It’s just, should she ever ask a price of you, that is something to talk with us about, I think.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, if it would make you two feel any better, next time I see her I can ask her what she wants from me.
Minna (as Myra): It would make me feel better. I would worry, I think.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. In fact, it might just simplify things if we all met Setarra in a not bloody flurry of chaos.
Kim (as Blaire): You guys want to meet her?
Minna: I think Myra looks at Minx with, like, an ‘are you sure about this’ look in her eyes.
Josie (as Minx): I think it’s less a matter of want, and more of a matter of quite literally the devil you know versus the devil you don’t.
Kim: Poor choice of words.
Rhi: No, I think absolutely deliberate, good use of words.
Kim: Yeah, but Blaire disagrees.
[laughter]
Kim: Anyway, um:
Kim (as Blaire): You promise you won’t freak out if you meet her?
Minna (as Myra): I can’t promise that. You’ve seen me in some situations. But I’ll do my best.
Josie (as Minx): I promise not to ‘freak out’, as you put it, though I will keep my kerchief upon me.
Minna (as Myra): I promise not to act against her unless you say so.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s probably for the best, because, I don’t know, I feel like if we did that, that would probably be bad? I’ve just been, kind of, doing–
Minna (as Myra): I agree with you. I just, I’m wondering what you’re asking of me when you ask me not to freak out. If you mean will I be cool with your friend, I will be cool with your friend.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, yeah, just be cool. I’m cool with her. If you want to meet her tonight, I could summon her tonight.
Josie (as Minx): I- I mean, are you ready for this?
Minna (as Myra): I mean, it’s as good a time as any, isn’t it?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh my gods, okay, then um–
Josie (as Minx): All right, let me compose myself a moment.
Kim (as Blaire): I guess I’m summoning her again tonight. Okay. Um, just be cool. And we’ll do that later.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, are you cool?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): All right. You were sounding a little bit…
Kim (as Blaire): No, I’m excited. Like, I thought you guys would, like, freak out at me and tell me not to summon her again, or, you know, something like that. But, I don’t know, the fact that you guys are even willing to just hear her out, that’s pretty cool.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I feel like were it any other person that would be our response, yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, most people are assholes, but not you guys. So, thanks.
Rhi: So from there do we want to go to this?
Josie: Yeah, why the fuck not?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: [sighs] We’re meeting a demon.
Josie: Yeah!
Rhi: Yeah, so where do you go to do this?
Josie: How about there’s a little basement that runs right up to the canal, or something? So, there’s like, a little bit of water run-off into there, because she’s a sea demon and all that?
Kim: I like that.
Rhi: So, you head over to this spot. There’s probably, you know, kind of, the chalky remains of when Blaire has drawn sigils there previously.
Kim: I, kind of, rub the spot with my sleeve to clean it off, and I draw the sigil again.
Rhi: How much salt water do you have? Like, a bowl?
Kim: You know what? Because it’s a special occasion and I’m meeting friends, I’m gonna bring a larger bowl than usual for this.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim And let’s see, maybe I brought in a pitcher from my room, or whatever, and I’m just gonna pour whatever stash I have in my room, not all of it, but like a good chunk of it, into the bowl and just give her an easier time of getting here.
Rhi: Okay. So you set up the summoning thing. While Blaire is setting this up, Minx and Myra, what are you two up to? What are you two doing?
Josie: Minx has almost done herself up like she’s trying to impress someone.
Kim: Oh my god, so gay.
Josie: Not romantically impress, like, almost like she’s going in to enquire about a job or something.
Kim: First impressions.
Rhi: It’s the way she dresses up when she’s, like, going to con information out of nobility.
Josie. Exactly. And she is visibly trying very hard to not look disconcerted by the room, but is obviously very disconcerted.
Rhi: [laughs] How about Myra?
Minna: I think, just, kind of like, standing with her arms crossed, like, at her most stoic. She’s not going to admit how nervous this makes her. Why would she do a thing like that?
Rhi: Feelings? Pssh. I don’t have those. So, Blaire finishes the ritual and there’s, like, a moment of silence. And then, sort of a rushing splashing sound, and the woman that you saw a few nights ago surges up out of the bowl. And she looks first at Blaire and smiles faintly, and says:
## [00:21:37] Content warning: emotional abuse. To skip, go to next timestamp.
Rhi (as Setarra): I will forgive you for troubling me again, given the amusements you provided me recently.
Kim (as Blaire): I know it’s a little soon, but nice to see ya.
Rhi: And then her gaze kind of slides off Blaire, over to Minx and Myra, and her eyes narrow. And, like, she’s clearly addressing Blaire, but she’s still looking at the two of them. She just goes:
Rhi (as Setarra): Who are these people?
Kim (as Blaire): Setarra–
Josie (as Minx): Er–
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay, um, hold on–
Josie (as Minx): Er, yes, um, we are Blaire’s associates. I am Minx and this is Myra. Um, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Setarra, was it?
Rhi (as Setarra): Why have you brought them?
Kim (as Blaire): They wanted to meet you. They’re part of my crew.
Rhi: She scowls. Whatever, like, good will she was feeling at the beginning of this conversation is just gone. And she very quickly, without moving from where she’s standing, she reaches out, grabs Blaire’s arm, pulls her in, there’s another, like, pillar of water, and then both Setarra and Blaire are gone.
Minna: [shrieking gasp] What?
Josie: What? Minx has a sword out and is fucking, like, trying to look for anything to stab, but there’s nothing.
Rhi: There’s just the now empty bowl, kind of like, rattling back and forth on the ground. So, we cut over to the docks, not anywhere near Ink Row, just like, out on one of the piers. And it’s just kind of quiet and still. The rain’s still falling. And there’s another surge of water up from the sea and Blaire and Setarra both appear standing on the pier, and she like, kind of, she pushes Blaire back at the same time as she is letting go of her arm so that there’s more distance between them.
Kim: It’s a forceful, kind of like, let go.
Rhi: Yeah. And is just like:
Rhi (as Setarra): What are you thinking?
Kim (as Blaire): I- I’m sorry, I didn’t know it’d make you upset, I–
Rhi (as Setarra): My arrangement is with you and you alone. You are the one that I have chosen. You are special. I do not care about whatever associates you use to accomplish our ends.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m sorry.
Rhi: She just sort of waves a hand dismissively.
Rhi (as Setarra): Did you only bring me here to meet them, or did you have some other purpose in mind?
Kim (as Blaire): I’m sorry, that is what I summoned you for. It’s just that they wanted to know, they wanted to meet you. Um, they’re my crew and last time I summoned you they saw you, and they wanted to know who you were and–
Rhi: She looks just, kind of like, disinterested, and doesn’t seem to find this to be a worthwhile reason for dragging her out here. And is like:
Rhi (as Setarra): If that is all you wanted, then I will return to my other business.
Kim (as Blaire): Wait.
Rhi: And she just sort of gives you a flat look.
Kim (as Blaire): Setarra, what is our arrangement exactly?
Rhi: She kind of studies you for a long moment, and says:
Rhi (as Setarra): As I said, you are special. You see things that others do not. I wish to help you see more. But, I need you to bring me knowledge, so that we can learn together. Grow together. Discover the unknown.
Kim (as Blaire): Together.
Rhi: She nods.
Rhi (as Setarra): But this is for you, Blaire. I’ve chosen you. Alone.
Kim (as Blaire): I know, and I’m grateful for that. I just, I guess I was just, curious to know what you wanted in return. But, you answered that. So, we’re good.
Rhi: She nods, and says:
Rhi (as Setarra): I will ask things of you in the future, but they will be things that will benefit us both.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: She nods again, and then sort of, like, seems to turn to water and falls through the pier, down into the ocean.
Kim: Blaire is going to stand in silence for just a minute. She is going to want to catch her breath and just get her bearings, look around a bit. And after a moment she is just going to, like, very quickly slide down to sit down on the pier. She’s just going to bury her face in her hands and cry.
Rhi: Aww, no, and it’s raining!
## [00:26:34] End of content warning.
Kim: Oh it is, that’s right.
Minna: Baby!
Rhi: It’s raining, yeah, oh man. So, we’ll cut back to The Nest. I presume Minx and Myra have returned there.
Josie: Maybe? Minx is kind of like in obsessive ‘where the fuck did Blaire go’ mode. Where is she? Myra, our baby got kidnapped by a demon, we have to find her.
Minna and Kim: Aww.
Rhi: And like also, this is like, the last time somebody on your crew was out of your sight, she got sent to jail. So, like, okay, so then where are the two of you?
Josie: We’re fucking scouring the area just outside The Nest. Maybe we, like, call the Gondoliers and like–
Minna: God, yeah.
Josie: Yeah. Like get on one, and go on a fucking search party.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think that it’s Kay who shows up and like, how much of the situation do you explain?
Josie: Just that Blaire has been taken and we need to find her. Because Minx is too frantic to do much else.
Rhi: Yeah, Kay very quickly picks up on that the two of you are freaking out and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Okay. Yeah, yeah. Let’s… do you have any idea which direction?
Josie (as Minx): I have no idea, but we could head towards the water? Her pursuers seem to have some sort of affinity to water, I don’t know. That’s why we called you.
Rhi: Kay gives you a look that’s like, just a little bit suspicious and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): All right. We’ll, I guess, head up to the docks then.
Rhi: So I think we see, you know, you guys heading in the gondola up through the canals, moving through the docks.
Josie (as Minx): We shouldn’t have asked her to do it. We shouldn’t have done that. We should have put our foot down; I need to get better about that.
Minna (as Myra): Minx, Minx, this isn’t helping anything.
Josie (as Minx): You’re right. You’re right, dear. You’re right.
Josie: She’s gonna smooth her hair back.
Josie (as Minx): We need to remain calm. We’ll be back with her before the end of the night.
Minna: Myra leans forward.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire has been dealing with Setarra for longer than we’ve known her. I think that if Setarra were going to harm her, I don’t think that at a first offence like this she would punish her too badly.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, yes, I suppose that must be the possibility we must go with in order to retain sanity. Mm-hmm.
Rhi: As you’re, like, moving through the canals, you pass some other gondoliers and Kay asks:
Rhi (as Kay): Hey, have you seen Blaire? The little one with the horns?
Rhi: And, you know, they pretty much all are shaking their heads, until after you’ve been out for a little bit, one of the gondoliers says:
Rhi (as Gondolier): Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw her walking.
Rhi: And he like, he gives, you know, a canal and a street area.
Rhi (as Gondolier): Just a few minutes ago over that way.
Rhi: And Kay, like, very quickly starts pulling in that direction. And I think that you all catch up with Blaire just as she’s going across one of the bridges towards the southern end of the docks.
Josie: I think you probably hear Minx’s heeled boots clacking before you see her, because she’s gonna basically just come run and grab you into her arms.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx? Oh!
Josie (as Minx): Thank the gods.
Minna: Myra’s not far behind, and she smiles at the two of them.
Josie (as Minx): You’re all right. We knew you would be. You’ve been dealing with this. But where were you?
Kim (as Blaire): She took me to the–
Josie (as Minx): You know what? It doesn’t matter. We’re going back to The Nest, right now.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: I think Kay is just waiting there in the gondola to take the three of you back home. And when you get in, she just, kind of like, gives Blaire a smile and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Good to see that you’re all right.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks Kay.
Josie (as Minx): I think I’m going to, kind of like, shower Kay with praise and give her a hefty tip and just like, I’m not slowing down yet. Not until we’re back to The Nest.
Kim: I love Minx, oh my God.
Rhi: So, Kay brings you back to, kind of, your usual dock in Six Towers. You all head back upstairs and inside The Nest and all of you are, you know, I think Blaire is soaked to the skin.
Kim: Yeah, she’s dripping.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx and Myra are not exactly dry either. And what’s everybody doing?
Josie (as Minx): You know what? I need a moment. I’m gonna go freshen up for a moment.
Minna: Myra puts on the kettle. [laughs]
Rhi: Oh, yay.
Josie: Aww.
Kim: She’s just gonna go straight to her room and, like, not say a word. Just immediately change into something dry.
Rhi: The tea is poured and everybody’s back at the table again.
Josie: Minx has got her hair up in a towel bun.
Kim: Oh my God, yes.
Josie (as Minx): So. So, Blaire. What just happened?
Kim (as Blaire): She just took me to the docks. That’s all.
Josie (as Minx): Okay. You have to understand that this didn’t exactly settle our worries.
Kim (as Blaire): No. I know.
Minna (as Myra): Are you quite all right?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just, I thought that would go better. But she doesn’t want to meet you guys. So you just have to leave it at that.
Josie (as Minx): I must say I’m rather uncomfortable with that outcome.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s fine! It’s just, she only wants me.
Josie (as Minx): Wants you for what?
Kim (as Blaire): To know the world. That’s what she told me.
Josie (as Minx): So she’s undertaking your education?
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Josie (as Minx): Out of the kindness of–
Kim (as Blaire): No, I’m well educated enough. I don’t need to be educated any more. It’s trading knowledge for knowledge, it’s different than a book smarts thing.
Josie (as Minx): All right. So, you are exchanging information then, and that is the extent of it?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): She has not put a price on your soul or the like?
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Josie (as Minx): I am honestly at a loss. I cannot claim that I trust Setarra at all, but I do trust Blaire.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I think, Blaire, I think I trust you. But if you ever need help we are here.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Minna (as Myra): And that’s as far as I’ll take it.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s all I ask.
Josie (as Minx): And should Setarra ever attempt to extract a terrible price from you, we must know immediately.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: I there’s kind of an awkward silence as everybody is sipping their tea and the scene fades out. And there’s sort of a time lapse shot of the docks, of the former Ink Row area. Very fast, you know, we see some tents going up, some ramshackle huts, there’s a wave of Bluecoats that come in. They get repelled by a mix of Lampblacks and refugees. And about two weeks after the riots, we come back in on Nightmarket. Early afternoon, not that it’s terribly obvious. There’s a bit of fog rolling in, and we see Myra making her way down the street towards the café, and Jeren is sitting at their usual table, kind of, off against one wall with a clear view of the window, which he has his back towards. Because he knows that Myra likes to have a seat where she has a clear view of all windows and exits.
[laughter]
Kim: Wow.
Minna: I feel very attacked because I didn’t even specify that. Yeah, so Myra comes in and she spots him immediately and kind of settles in with like, a little smile.
Minna (as Myra): How are you doing?
Rhi: He looks tired and, because I think this is the first time you two have seen each other since the riots. He looks not exactly happy to see you.
Minna: Oh, she deflates, like, visibly.
Rhi (as Jeren): [sighs] If I were a better Bluecoat, I would be arresting you right now.
Minna (as Myra): You’re an archivist; you wouldn’t normally have responsibility for that.
Rhi (as Jeren): I still took oaths. I still have the authority to do so.
Minna (as Myra): If you don’t want to be my friend anymore, I would understand why.
Rhi (as Jeren): I don’t know, Myra. I just…
Rhi: And he kind of like, looks around, but there’s, you know, nobody really near your table, he’s just like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Why? I mean, what did you have to gain from the ambassador?
Minna (as Myra): We didn’t have anything to gain. She was… do you want to hear about it or would you rather not? Because…
Rhi (as Jeren): I need to know why so that I can decide if I am going to have you arrested.
Minna (as Myra): That club, The Centuralia Club. She and her friends there have been taking innocent people and… it’s hard to explain. They were taking the unseen people of Duskwall, people that nobody would care about, and they were giving them drugs and trying to use them for some arcane purposes, and it was killing them. And nobody cared, and nobody knew, and we found out, and things got out of hand. But I can understand why my friend was angry enough to kill. She took a parasite out of the world.
Rhi: Jeren is just giving you this incredulous look and is just like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Myra, that’s crazy. That’s not–
Minna (as Myra): It’s true. We saw the chamber. They captured my friend and tried to do it to… [sighs]
Rhi (as Jeren): Look, I know there’s a lot of, you know, corruption in this city, but that’s–
Minna (as Myra): Jeren, your father is a barrister. You have quite a cushy job with The Bluecoats. You have never seen the underbelly of this city. I have. I was born into it. And you know what? People do this to people like me all of the time. And it’s time it fucking changed.
Rhi (as Jeren): I just… why would they do something like that?
Minna (as Myra): Because they had a lot to gain. Because they would get power that a lot of people in this city don’t have.
Rhi (as Jeren): The ambassador already had power and wealth and prestige.
Minna (as Myra): You know what? I can’t tell you why she wanted more. But she did.
Rhi: He just kind of like, leans back in his chair and studies you for a few moments, and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): You really believe all this, don’t you?
Minna (as Myra): I’ve read the papers. I’ve seen the places where this happened. And even if I hadn’t, it’s not that strange to me.
Rhi (as Jeren): I dunno, Myra, that’s a lot to swallow.
Minna (as Myra): I know it’s a lot to swallow, but you asked to hear it. And you’re the oldest friend that I have. But if this is going to keep working, I think you need to understand that I’m going to be finding things like this, and I’m going to be confronting them. Because I can’t do anything else if I see it, not anymore.
Rhi (as Jeren): I- I mean I believe that you believe it was justified. I just–
Minna (as Myra): Do you think The Bluecoats are protecting this city?
Rhi (as Jeren): Of course. I mean, could we be doing a better job? Yes. Is there a problem with corruption in the ranks? Yes. But, what’s the alternative?
Minna (as Myra): How would you fix it?
Rhi (as Jeren): I don’t know. I mean, we’d make reforms, have, you know, restrictions about not taking bribes and things like that, you know, enforced. The change would have to be coming from inside The Bluecoats though, you know? Nothing’s gonna get better if it comes from outside, people are going to feel like it’s being shoved down their throats, you know? You have to give these things time.
Minna (as Myra): In the meantime, people are being hurt and I can’t just sit and wait and hope that it’s going to get better.
Rhi (as Jeren): I don’t know, Myra. I mean, I want to stay your friend, but I don’t know how much I can help you with this. Not while I’m doing what I do. And I joined The Bluecoats because I wanted to help, I wanted to protect the city in some way, even if it’s just from behind a desk most of the time.
Minna (as Myra): I believe you want to help. I just, I won’t ask the same things of you that I have been, not if it’s gonna tear your loyalties the way that it has.
Rhi (as Jeren): They’re already pretty torn. But, thanks.
Minna (as Myra): I want to keep you as a friend, Jeren, I do. I just, I think I just needed you to understand where things are heading, because it’s not gonna get less like this. It’s probably going to get worse.
Rhi (as Jeren): I just wish you didn’t feel like you had to do this. There’s other ways.
Minna (as Myra): And what am I gonna do, Jeren? Join The Bluecoats myself?
Rhi (as Jeren): I don’t know.
Minna (as Myra): Can you see that?
Rhi: He kind of like, pauses for a second and, like, stares in the middle distance, and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): [laughs] Yeah, I guess you’re right. I just, I don’t know. I feel like there has to be some other way besides attacking a club full of innocent people and killing an ambassador, you know?
Minna (as Myra): We didn’t attack anybody who didn’t deserve it.
Rhi: He just kind of shakes his head and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): We should go and order our food.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Turn to less heavy subjects.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah.
Rhi: We fade out on Myra and Jeren having their lunch and come back in on the same café a little while later. The fog has gotten thicker outside. We see Jeren, like, disappearing around the corner down at the far end of the street, just as Myra is leaving. The two of them don’t ever really leave together. Where is Myra headed towards? Is she heading home, is she heading to The Hound’s Paw, are there other places she’s going?
Minna: I think she’s heading home.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: But winding her way through Nightmarket.
Rhi: So, Myra, you are heading, sort of, generally up towards Six Towers, but not taking a direct path there, and you notice after a little while that you’ve been hearing, kind of, the same set of footsteps behind you for a few blocks.
Minna: So, I think she hesitates for a moment and then keeps walking. But she has a hand, like, creeping towards her gun.
Rhi: As you do that, you look up and you see a figure in, like, a heavy, long coat that is hanging open. Which is kind of weird, because there’s sort of a midday chill with all the fog in the air. And he’s walking towards you, not really looking at you, but just sort of striding purposefully in your direction. And when he gets a few strides away, he slips a hand into his coat and you see him starting to pull out something, maybe it’s a pistol, maybe it’s a truncheon, it’s definitely some kind of weapon. And then his eyes finally go to you and you hear the footsteps behind you speed up.
Minna: Okay, I think I drop to the ground and am turning to look at the person following me. Kind of, like, turning sideway so that I can sort of glance between the two of them.
Rhi: Yeah. The guy who was behind you is running towards you now and has a truncheon in his hand.
Minna: I think she’s actually just gonna, like, bolt across the road.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so you book it across the street and how do you use your, kind of, knowledge of the city and your skills in conspiracy and planning to get away?
Mina: So, I think she ducks down an alley and like, knocks on a back door, and somebody she knows in one of the shops lets her through.
Rhi: I think the shot is, we see the two of them, like, you know, weapons out, looking around, running down the alley, and then it pans up through this shop, and I think it’s a shop that sells, like, it’s a clothing shop, so there’s scarves and hats and stuff, and we see Myra coming out the front door with a scarf kind of over her head and wrapped around her neck, and kind of like concealing her face a little bit.
Mina: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: And she just like heads off in a different direction, walking very briskly. You make it back to The Nest without any other trouble. Blaire, where are you hanging out right now?
Kim: Blaire is, yeah, she’s probably in her room. She’s, like, dissecting something right now.
Rhi: Oh my God.
Minna (as Myra): Minx? Blaire? Anyone home?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm?
Kim: Blaire’s gonna open her door.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, what’s up?
Minna (as Myra): Um, be cautious going out. Is Minx out?
Kim (as Blaire): I think so? I don’t know. I’ve been in here a couple hours.
Minna (as Myra): I just got attacked. Well, they tried to attack me in the street. I’m fine, but I–
Kim (as Blaire): Who’s they? What?
Minna (as Myra): I didn’t get a good-, I didn’t stop to ask, actually. I ducked through a shop, you know, and got away.
Rhi: I will say that, like, as you’re thinking back, you realise that underneath the big bulky coats that they were both wearing, they were wearing the uniform of the guards at The Centuralia Club.
Minna (as Myra): It was Umbra Hunter, Centuralia security, you know, our friends in Six Towers.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. But you’re okay?
Minna (as Myra): I’m fine.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Well, I was planning on going out, you know, later this week. I have some trips to make.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, you mean…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I’ve got a lot of people waiting on me to get where they need. So, I was hoping to, you know, empty my shelves a little.
Minna (as Myra): I’ve been meaning to ask you about that.
Kim (as Blaire): Hmm? Okay.
Minna (as Myra): So, you were telling me you’re not a huge fan of, I guess, the kind of cremation the Spirit Wardens do?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, fuck the Spirit Wardens.
Minna (as Myra): So, what’s your ideal?
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean?
Minna (as Myra): I mean, in a just world, what happens to ghosts after people are dead.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, you don’t disintegrate them on the spot. Like, because it’s obviously not what they want, and it’s obviously, it sounds painful. I don’t know if they can actually feel pain, but you don’t zap them until they’re nothing.
Minna (as Myra): You know they’re not like the people they were in life afterwards, right?
Kim (as Blaire): I know that. I know that. I’m not delusional about that. It’s just, listen. This is what we know. We know, right now, that there is some kind of life after death, okay? We know that. When we die, everybody turns into ghosts, for better or for worse, usually worse, it kinda sucks, it’s a bad deal, nobody really likes it. We turn into ghosts. But, like, after that? What’s after that? When a Spirit Warden just takes somebody out of the world, where do they go? What’s left of you?
Minna (as Myra): I’d always assumed that it’s nothing.
Kim (as Blaire): That doesn’t scare you?
Minna (as Myra): It scares me less than the alternative. It’s quite comforting to imagine that I won’t come back as that. That I’m disposed of properly, at least, please.
Kim (as Blaire): They shouldn’t be disposed of. It’s, I mean–
Minna (as Myra): Have you met an angry ghost? I know you’ve met angry ghosts, I’ve been with you.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes. Yes, I have.
Minna (as Myra): And you think that’s any way to exist?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know. I mean, every case is different. I guess it just depends on what each and every one of them want. Maybe they’ll want to die, die for real, maybe some of them want to stay on, I don’t know. But who are we to make that choice for them?
Minna: Myra is just kind of frowning sceptically. She cannot agree with Blaire on this.
Minna (as Myra): What about the ones who are dangerous? Which is, from what I understand, many of them.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, that’s what I’m trying to do with The Deathlands. Whether they’re dangerous or not, it’s where they can at least be left alone. You know? Nobody will come after them, or bother them, and they can just feed on whatever they can find without really hurting anyone that’s living.
Minna (as Myra): I just can’t imagine that being preferable.
Kim (as Blaire): You’d prefer to just-, I don’t know, I don’t know how to explain it, because there’s just… is there nothing? After being a ghost?
Minna (as Myra): I hope so.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, okay, I can kinda get what you’re coming from. I can see how a living person would really want to not live on and angry forever and lose little bits of themselves day by day by day, and would rather prefer, you know, just to go to sleep forever. I get that sounds peaceful. The thing is that we don’t really have a way to do that in a non-violent way for other ghosts. Do you know what I mean? And every time I’ve seen a Spirit Warden go after someone, the process is obviously very traumatic.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t have a good answer for you. I just know what I’d want.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s fair. I get it. I do.
Minna (as Myra): And I don’t like the idea of, I don’t like them wandering around.
Kim (as Blaire): I know you don’t. I’m just trying to explain it.
Minna (as Myra): I understand.
Kim (as Blaire): Most ghosts don’t want what you want, is the thing.
Minna (as Myra): Most ghosts just want to feed.
Kim (as Blaire): Right. I’m trying to give that to them.
Minna (as Myra): Or to get revenge.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, if that’s what they’ve gotta do, then they can do it. Like I said, case by case.
Minna (as Myra): But you know they’ll do it by preying on the living if they can, you know that right?
Kim (as Blaire): I know.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know why I’m saying this like I expect you not to know, because you know more than I do about any of this, but, they’re a danger.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, they were people once too.
Minna (as Myra): Once. Not anymore.
Rhi: I think we’ve got another sort of time lapse shot of Ink Row. There’s another, sort of, Bluecoat push that destroys a bunch of the tents and shacks that were built up. They’ve kind of occupied about half of the space and pushed the people living there back into the remaining space. And I think then we also see quick, sort of, montage shots of The Magpies in The Nest, you know, leaning over maps of the docks and, you know, then there’s like an addition of some papers that have names and maps of Brightstone and the three of them are in, like, animated discussion about things. And then, we fade over to a peaceful Brightstone street. There’s a few, kind of, large, fenced-in manors, there’s a high-end jewellery store, there is one of those art galleries that is by appointment only, there’s a small café. We kind of focus in on one of the manors that has a big wrought iron gate in the middle of the fence. And the, kind of, seal thing on the gates is a pair of crossed swords with a stylised elaborate ‘M’ overlaid over the top of them. So, where are the individual members of The Magpies camped out as they are casing Lord Mora’s estate?
Josie: I am probably gonna do my normal gather info by chatting up cafés and stuff like that.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, so you’re hanging out in the café?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, where are you to, sort of, watch this area?
Myra: I think probably towards, like, whatever the servant’s entrance is.
Rhi: Okay. So, around the back of the house, kind of in the alley. And Blaire, where are you hanging out?
Kim: I was thinking I am on the roof, or either scoping out the basement.
Rhi: Let’s go with on the roof.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, I like that. The first sign of trouble, Minx, you notice that the person you’re talking with, who has been chatting you up a lot and seems to be determined to, kind of, keep you in this conversation, you at first thought it was just her being kind of a chatty person who wanted attention. But then you notice that she keeps glancing towards the door as if, you know, she’s expecting someone. And then, the door does open and a man in the Centuralia Club guard uniform steps in, followed by three Bluecoats.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: At which point the woman you’ve been talking with stands up and says:
Rhi (as Woman): She’s over here!
Josie: Okay, she doesn’t give me a chance. Um, I think I’m gonna, for like two seconds, try to keep up the ruse.
Josie (as Minx): What are you talking about? This is mightily rude–
Josie: And then just two seconds into my sentence, realise the jig is up, cast off my cloak and bolt for the back of the café. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. So you go sprinting towards the back. We cut over to Myra, who’s about halfway down the alley, and then two figures kind of step into the alley in front of her. And you recognise them. It’s the same two who were chasing you a couple of weeks ago. And one of them says:
Rhi (as Umbra Hunter): You’re not getting away this time.
Rhi: And behind you another two, kind of, step in, so they’ve got both ends of the alley blocked off. What do you do?
Minna: Um… climbing gear. I go up the side.
Rhi: You just, like, throw a rope up a building and scramble up?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. And Blaire. You’re kind of sitting there, watching the house, and you hear the access door to this roof slam open. And you spin around to see, kinda like Minx, there’s a Centuralia club guard trailed by a few Bluecoats rushing towards you.
Kim: Can I hardcore Parkour out of there?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, she’s just gonna, I don’t know, jump to another roof, just get away.
Rhi: So like, Blaire you run and you jump and you manage to grab the gutter on the next roof, and you’re hanging by your hands and you have that flash of the last time this happened.
Kim: Yeah, I was gonna say, come on, again?
Rhi: But you have that flash, and just like, you kind of start to turn your head to look down and then just, like, manage to push through it and pull yourself up and roll onto the roof and keep running.
Kim: Oh, thank God.
Rhi: Yeah, the three of you split and just kind of go running off into the city. And I think each of you is followed. So, none of you head back to, kind of like, your normal haunts. You don’t go to The Nest, you don’t go The Hound’s Paw. You all just sort of scatter into the city and have to go pretty far in order to lose everyone. And so, I think first we follow Minx, who makes her way, kind of, clear across the city over to Silkshore and then she reaches a four-storey, clearly kind of older, a little bit shabby, the paint is peeling, but it’s not like, in disrepair, type apartment building. And she lets herself inside and climbs up the stairs to the fourth floor, makes her way down the hall and knocks on one of the doors. And after a few moments, the door opens a crack and you see, like, a sliver of face peering out, and then the door opens and Nyryx is there, kind of looking a little confused, like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Minx! I wasn’t expecting to see you, you said you were going to be busy for the next few days. Are you all right?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, we had to cut the business short. May I step in for a few moments?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yeah, of course.
Rhi: And she ushers you in and does that thing where she, like, leans out the door and kind of looks up and down the hallway before closing the door.
Josie (as Minx): I apologise for not bringing any wine, and for the unannounced visit, but it’s–
Rhi (as Nyryx): It’s fine, it’s fine, you know I’m always happy to see you.
Josie (as Minx): Likewise.
Rhi: And she herds you over to a chair. Nyryx’s apartment, it’s small, it’s a studio apartment, but it’s very comfortable, it’s very homey. She has made this into undeniably her space. She has a big comfortable bed with a lot of, like, blankets and quilts and pillows on it, there are some small tapestries and, you know, little sketches and things. And Minx, you have a lot of art as well, but yours is, kind of, chosen largely for value and artistic significance. The stuff that Nyryx has, like, some of it isn’t very skilled, but there’s clearly, kind of, a theme of the people of the city. There’s a lot of sketches of just, sort of like, street scenes and things, you know, of people just out in the city, things like that. She has, you know, a couple, like, very comfortable big stuffed chairs near the window, there’s a little end table with a stack of books, the top one has a bookmark in it. And, yeah, it’s just a very warm a cosy space that she’s made for herself here. So she goes over to the little kitchen area and comes back with a glass of, like, watered-down wine. She hands it to you and then she sits down in the chair across from you and does that thing where she, like, tucks her legs up under her and is kind of curled in the chair and is like:
Multiple: Aww.
Rhi (as Nyryx): What happened? Or do I even wanna know?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, well, to make a long story short, thank you for the wine by the way, turns out when you come to blows, in a manner of fashion, with a gang’s leader, the rest of the gang gets very bad. Who knew?
Rhi (as Nyryx): You didn’t cross Bazso again, did you?
Josie (as Minx): No, no, no. We’ve been talking some, actually. It’s beneficial to at least one of us, I believe. So, no, no. It’s just, you probably haven’t heard of the gang name. But, one of our heists crossed with theirs, and violently, so now things are a little rough, it appears.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh. Are you- are you going to be all right? I mean, is this…
Josie (as Minx): I admit I came here a bit out of instinct. I will endeavour to fix this after just a few hours here, if that’s okay.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Of course, of course. It’s fine.
Rhi: She just kind of frowns a little bit, and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Why… why do you keep doing this?
Josie: Minx is sipping her wine.
Josie (as Minx): Keep doing what, Nyryx?
Rhi: She just makes, sort of, a broad gesture out towards the city and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): All of this risking your life for, I don’t know, it doesn’t even seem to bring you very much money.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] Yeah, I’ve noticed. You ask a very good question, and I’m not certain I can give you an answer at the moment. It was supposed to just eventually make living comfortable.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I mean, you could have that without risking your life like this all the time, you know? I mean, I’m comfortable. I’m content.
Josie (as Minx): That’s true. And I’m really, really happy you didn’t get wrapped up in this the way me and Bazso did.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I just, it feels like you’re never content. You’re always chasing after something else.
Josie (as Minx): I’m not, I don’t know what that feels like. Sure, I might be able to pull living together for myself, but will that be enough for the rest of us? Will that enough for you and Bazso and anyone else? I don’t want any of us to go to where we came from.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Bazso and I can take care of ourselves, Ellie.
Josie (as Minx): And do you not believe that I can?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well… [laughs] You came running in here in a bit of a panic after another job went wrong, and the number of times you’ve gotten hurt, I mean, you have a lot more scars now, dear.
Josie (as Minx): Well, we are all, the four of us, possibly three of us, I do think we are moving a different direction. I got to go into The Centuralia Club not too long ago.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh gosh, you’ve wanted that for so long.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. Yeah. It was… I’ll say it was enlightening.
Rhi (as Nyryx): It wasn’t what you were hoping, was it?
Josie (as Minx): No. No, it wasn’t, Nyryx. It was not.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I’m sorry.
Rhi: And she like, unfolds herself from the chair and walks over to yours and, like, does that thing where she sits down on your lap and kind of drapes an arm around your shoulders.
Kim: [delighted squeal]
Josie: Aww. I’ll nuzzle in a little bit.
Rhi: She kind of, like, pulls your head down to her shoulder and kisses your forehead and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): I’m sorry it wasn’t what you wanted, but maybe now you have a chance to figure out what you do want? Something that would make you happy?
Josie (as Minx): I suppose. I thought I had it pretty well in hand, but I suppose I don’t. Nyryx, I’m not… you’ve seen a lot of people come through. I’m not like the people at The Centuralia Club, am I?
Rhi: She kind of has to, like, think for a second about what kind of people you’re referring to, and then shakes her head, and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): No. You’re too much of a soft touch.
Rhi: And kind of, like, taps your nose.
Kim: [squeal]
Josie: Minx is blushing furiously.
Rhi: She’s had kind of like a little fond smile on her face this whole time, and I think when she sees you blushing, the smile turns a bit more to a smirk, and she’s like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, if you’re going to be here for a few hours…
Rhi: Significant eyebrow raise.
Josie: Yep. I think I’m gonna move in for the kiss now.
Rhi: And we’ll fade out on that. So, where does Blaire run to when everything goes sideways?
Kim: Blaire is hardcore Parkour-ing over the roofs until she reaches the point where I think she feels far enough away and she can make her way to the ground, and it’s probably close to Six Towers, if not in Six Towers, this section of canals that she makes her way over to. Either way, she makes her way underground, probably, I can’t say, like, out of habit anymore, because I feel like she hasn’t done this in a while. It’s probably just because it’s the first thing that came to her mind and she was close to there anyway, and she’s like, ‘Oh, I know this way’, so she just goes that way. So, Blaire goes through an alleyway and then makes her way down these stairs that lead to the canals, and if she just turns, like, over to a sharp right, almost like a 360 behind herself, it leads to this very small tunnel. And it leads to these catacombs. And it’s probably some kind of underground system that she knows will take her close to The Nest, so she’s just gonna take the underground route.
Rhi: Okay. And I think, like, the catacombs under the city, because Duskwall was founded before the cataclysm, the catacombs are leftover from a time when it was still safe to bury the dead.
Kim: Damn. Cool.
Rhi: There’s not a ton left down here, a lot of the remains have just, kind of, been cleared out over the years by, you know, collectors or just scavengers. Whispers collecting bones to do rituals, things of that sort.
Minna: Oh God, bones would be a hot commodity these days, wouldn’t they?
Rhi: Yeah. But there’s very little left. And as Blaire is kind of making her way through the catacombs, all of a sudden a figure sort of slides out of the wall in front of her.
Kim (as Blaire): Ahh!
Rhi: And it comes to a stop, and it is the spirit Neera, who assisted her with the riots and she, when Blaire startles back, she puts up her hand and is like:
Rhi (as Neera): Um, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to frighten you.
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t sneak up on me like that.
Rhi (as Neera): Sorry, I forget about, it’s sometimes hard to remember that you can’t see–
Kim (as Blaire): No, I–
Rhi (as Neera): Yes, yes.
Kim (as Blaire): I get it. I get it, you’re incorporeal. I’ll probably be the same way, it’s fine.
Rhi (as Neera): Well, hopefully not any time soon.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, yeah, obviously.
Rhi (as Neera): I’ve been looking for you. I tried to return the place where you had us before when we were in the jars, but it seems to be very heavily warded.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, that wasn’t my decision, by the way. Sorry about that.
Rhi: She shrugs. She’s like:
Rhi (as Neera): I can understand. Many of the-, well, most of the spirits in the city are dangerous. It’s wise to take precautions.
Kim: Blaire shrugs.
Rhi (as Neera): I have been, as I told you, looking for that group that I’d heard rumours of. Spirits like myself, who have retained their minds. And I think I may have made a connection.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Rhi (as Neera): Actually, it was another spirit that you helped some time ago, who is like me.
Kim (as Blaire): Who is it?
Rhi (as Neera): Well, she has lost her own name. She was a young woman when she died, and you helped her get away from a spirit trafficker, but the name she uses now is that of her host, Nyryx.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasp]
Josie: [pained gasp]
Minna: [stifled scream]
Kim: Yes!
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Anyway, out of character aside, so she’s listening.
Kim (as Blaire): Wait, Nyryx is possessed?
Rhi (as Neera): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): How did I not notice that?
Rhi: Neera just shrugs.
Kim (as Blaire): I’ve met her. The host I mean, I’ve met the host body. But–
Rhi (as Neera): Well, you’ve met both of them, it seems. The spirit, I spoke to her recently as I was in my search, and she says that there are a handful of spirits like us, who have maintained their minds, and she remembered you. We are trying to make contact with the others, but both she and I believe that they would be glad of your help. Most among the living don’t really distinguish amongst spirits; they wish to control or exterminate all of us.
Kim (as Blaire): I know.
Rhi (as Neera): And I think that with the aid of someone like you, perhaps there may be more like us than we realise.
Kim (as Blaire): I think so too. That’s what I’ve been trying to do this whole time. I was actually just trying to explain this to someone earlier and they, like, didn’t get it, you know? It was like, way over their head.
Rhi (as Neera): Well, you understand. And the other spirits that I’ve spoken to are a little less trusting. But Nyryx’s spirit and I will continue to talk to them, and if we can persuade them to meet with you, one of us will contact you and bring you there so you can meet with them.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, yeah.
Rhi (as Neera): And perhaps they can find ways for you to help.
Rhi: And I think she, kind of like, looks down the hall and is like:
Rhi (as Neera): Would you like company as you’re returning to your home?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. Yeah, sure. I can even bring you back to The Nest, if you want. Unless you have other work to do, still.
Rhi (as Neera): No, I’m enjoying my freedom.
Kim (as Blaire): Fair.
Rhi: And so, yeah, you and Neera go floating off, well, walking slash floating down the catacombs.
Kim: Ah, so cute.
Rhi: So we come back in inside The Nest. Blaire, I think, is up in her room. Again. Per usual. Doing spooky stuff.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: What are Minx and Myra up to?
Josie: I think Minx is, like, in the midst of redecorating a little bit. Moving things around, finding a spot for Kevin, and sort of, periodically moving him.
Minna (as Myra): Glad you got away all right.
Josie (as Minx): Likewise. I knew we had angered The Circle of Flame quite a bit, but I wasn’t expecting it to go that bad that quickly.
Minna (as Myra): Neither was I. I suppose we were a little bit too ambitious so early after.
Josie (as Minx): Hmm. Perhaps.
Minna (as Myra): We’re going to have to be more careful.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm. Is this what you had in mind when you first pulled The Magpies together?
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] You mean, vowing to save dock workers from a terrible fate? Starting riots? I don’t think any of us could have envisioned-, well I suppose Phin could have envisioned that.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] Is that something you’re okay with us doing going forward? Because it seems like we can’t avoid it, especially not now.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think that we should avoid, I mean, it’s really up to each of you I think. But, I know that working with you and seeing things that happen and seeing what we can do, for me at least, it’s made me realise that there’s something that can be done.
Josie (as Minx): I’m glad to hear that. I’m feeling somewhat the same. Although, I’m uncertain of how much we can actually affect in the grand scheme of things.
Minna (as Myra): We do what we can, right? I mean, look at Phin. She’s been doing this longer than any of us. And just even the small ways that she’s helped, I’ve seen how much, I mean, remember when we attacked that hospital? I know that she has helped that girl since.
Josie (as Minx): That’s very good to hear. Although, I must say saying that we attacked a hospital out of context is a bit worrisome.
Minna (as Myra): The clinic. The one with the–
Josie (as Minx): Apologies, just making a joke. But, is that enough? Just helping young people here and there?
Minna (as Myra): It’s not enough. But it’s what we can do.
Josie (as Minx): Surely we can do more eventually?
Minna (as Myra): Well, eventually, yes.
Josie (as Minx): The Centuralia Club kind of made me realise how ingrained some of this stuff is.
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): Furthermore, we need to think of way to survive with less money.
Minna (as Myra): Ha. Yes, certainly that. I mean, I suppose it wouldn’t be completely strange, would it? You’re from Charhollow too, aren’t you?
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Minna (as Myra): We did what we could to get by.
Josie (as Minx): I was hoping this life would lead to a bit more than that.
Minna (as Myra): I have to admit, so was I. That was the original intent.
Josie (as Minx): But now it seems the course is to accept our lot as saviours of the innocent.
Minna (as Myra): Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?
Josie (as Minx): It does sound rather noble, and we’ve proven to not be terrible at that.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I had been wondering if you would be okay with the change.
Josie (as Minx): Why’s that?
Minna (as Myra): I mean, it’s always seemed to me that the possible luxury that this lifestyle could eventually lead to, not luxury, but greater luxury than we have, it seemed to me that that was something that motivated you.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, make no mistake. I still intend to retire living high on the horse, as it were, but, I don’t know, I’m not willing to be like them to get there.
Minna (as Myra): I’m glad to hear that.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): So, you spoke to Bazso, did you?
Josie (as Minx): Um, yes. Briefly. I figured we could use some amount of backup.
Minna (as Myra): Something that I don’t think you’ve been willing to do recently.
Josie (as Minx): Well, when we’re putting ourselves that much on the line, I find myself willing to consider things previously off-limits.
Minna (as Myra): Well, I’m glad you did.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Although it’s not coming without cost.
Minna (as Myra): Nothing comes without cost.
Josie (as Minx): And that’s the unfortunate truth, isn’t it? Well, at the very least, I hope you two can keep up a cordial relationship.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] He’s not such a bad sort, as gang leaders go.
Josie (as Minx): He could be worse. Although, honestly, I must say, he’s worse than I thought he was.
Minna (as Myra): You’ve known him long?
Josie (as Minx): We grew up together.
Minna (as Myra): Oh.
Josie (as Minx): Him, I and Nyryx.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think I knew that.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well I don’t bring up the topic much, but we all strove to get out of Charhollow in our own ways.
Minna (as Myra): Seems like you all did it, which is quite admirable.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I don’t know about admirable in I or his case, but Nyryx is happy, and that makes me happy.
Minna (as Myra): She’s your friend.
Josie (as Minx): Friend among other things, yes.
Minna (as Myra): Well, for the time being, at least, it’s good to have friends like them.
Josie (as Minx): Now, that’s the truth. And I must say, you’ve proven to be more than I could have hoped for as a friend and crewmate.
Minna (as Myra): I have to say the same.
Rhi: So, I think we have one last, sort of, time lapse. There’s a big clash between The Bluecoats and The Lampblacks and the people of the docks. They manage to push The Bluecoats back and start rebuilding again. The rebuilding seems to be going a little slower, though. There aren’t as many people there after that last push. We kinda move from that over across the city, people in the streets, Bluecoats on patrol, Spirit Wardens with their hauls, nobles walking to the somewhat recently reopened Centuralia Club, people of Charhollow and Coalridge on their way to the factories and the mines, and the merchants of Nightmarket making their way to their shops. And in Nightmarket we come to The Hound’s Paw, where the remaining Magpies are seated at their table, waiting for Rigney to bring over their drinks.
Josie (as Minx): I think if we’re considering a new direction, we might need one more person’s opinion, yes?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): So, what do we intend to do about that?
Kim (as Blaire): There’s, I mean, there’s very little we can do about it right now. I mean, what are we gonna do, like, storm the gates, break in, into Ironhook? It’s, I dunno, a tall order for just the three of us, isn’t it?
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps. Maybe we need to make it not just the three of us.
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, we are in a certain amount of trouble regarding certain groups. We could use, at least, another friend to help us out in the meantime.
Rhi: Rigney comes over with a tray as you’re saying that and sets it down and is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): They’re gonna have to be one hell of a friend to help with that.
Rhi: And he kind of, you know, tucks the tray under his arm and is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): If I thought I could be of any use, I’d offer, but I don’t have a lot of skills beyond mixing drinks.
Josie (as Minx): I was about to say though, speaking of hell of a friend.
Kim (as Blaire): True.
Rhi (as Rigney): How have you all been holding up these last couple of months?
Minna (as Myra): It’s been strange, hasn’t it?
Kim (as Blaire): It’s been okay, I think.
Rhi (as Rigney): I haven’t seen you around as much.
Minna (as Myra): Didn’t want to put you at that kind of risk.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, I have enough risk already, what’s one more, right?
Kim (as Blaire): No, this one’s like, really big risk.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Rhi (as Rigney): I know what you’ve gotten yourselves into and, well, just don’t be too much of strangers.
Josie (as Minx): We shan’t.
Minna (as Myra): if we had any other friends like you, Rigney, I don’t know how we could fail to survive.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, for what it’s worth, I’m a bit glad you don’t, because it means I get to see more of you.
Rhi: He’s kind of joking with you as normal, but he looks a little, still, kind of concerned or worried. There’s a little bit of tension around his eyes as he’s speaking.
Josie (as Minx): Rigney. I promise that once certain matters are taken care of, it’ll be one hell of a night in here the day that happens.
Rhi (as Rigney): [laughs] I am counting on it. I may have a special bottle stashed away for our wayward friend.
Josie (as Minx): Ooh, now there’s incentive.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): You mean more incentive.
Minna: Myra gives a playful glare.
Josie: Minx just kinda shrugs back.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, if there’s anything that I can do to help with, you know, I might not be able to break in anywhere, but I know people, got a lot of connections in the city.
Minna (as Myra): If you know anybody who’s particularly skilled with break-ins, we could use, perhaps, a contractor.
Rhi (as Rigney): I’ll see what I can come up with.
Minna (as Myra): Keep an ear out, don’t strain yourself too much.
Rhi: He just kinda shrugs. He’s like:
Rhi (as Rigney): I gotta get back to the bar.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi (as Rigney): He just nods and gives you, sort of, a two-finger salute, heads back.
Minna: Bless Rigney, he’s the best.
Kim: He’s so cute.
Josie: He’s such a good guy. I think one last thing, Minx is gonna hold up her glass and say:
Josie (as Minx): To Phin. To Rigney. To The Magpies.
Minna: I think they all clink.
Kim (as Blaire): Hear hear.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us.
We’ve had an amazing first two weeks on Patreon. We’ve blown through our first two goals and we’re within $40 of reaching our third. In addition to the Season 1 blooper reel and some upcoming bonus episodes we’re posting weekly notes, documents, art, deleted scenes and more. Visit patreon.com/magpiespodcast and help us do even more with the show.
As always, thank you to all our listeners for tuning in, leaving reviews, and tweeting at us.
We also have a bit of a challenge for our listeners. My one regret about the episodes featuring Seeks, our guest star from last season, was that she and Blaire never got to interact. A few months ago I got Kim and Waffles to help me correct that oversight, and we recorded a bonus episode with Seeks and Blaire on an exciting occult adventure together. the episode will be unlocked and released to everyone when we hit 600 Twitter followers. So, if you’re not already following us at @magpies_pod, go do that, if you are, tell your friends to start listening to the show and then follow us. This is a really great episode and I’m excited for everyone to hear it.
Also, in December, you can hear me, Minna and Josie on Character Creation Cast, a podcast about creating characters in different RPG systems. In December the system that they’re featuring is Blades in the Dark, and the hosts invited us to guide them through character and crew creation. It was a ton of fun and we made a really great crew. Be sure to check out the Blades in the Dark series which starts on December 3, and in the meantime check out their archives for character creation and player advice in a ton of systems. There will be a link to the site in the show notes.
Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Kim: Of the seven species of sea turtle that call our earth home all are either endangered or threatened. Things like pollution, climate change, overfishing and boat propellers put these beautiful animals at risk of disappearing for good. The South Carolina Aquarium is home to the state’s only sea turtle hospital where they rescue, rehabilitate and then release sick and injured turtles, and the way they accept donations is pretty unique.
The aquarium provides public access to the hospital’s Amazon wish list where you can shop for supplies that will aid their cause. Whether your gift be as humble as a pack of gauze or as extravagant as a new water filter, I promise there is something there you can give that fits every budget. A link to the hospital’s wish list will be provided in the show notes, and if you don’t wish to support the aquarium through Amazon, donations can be made directly through their website as well.
Please consider helping sea turtles in need and being a part of giving these animals a fighting chance at survival.
Rhi: If you have a few dollars to spare please consider donating.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:03:19]
Rhi: We open up on the old coal warehouse that The Lampblacks use as a base. There’s a lot more activity around here than when we’ve seen it previously; more of the Lampblack guards on patrol, more people hurrying around. Inside, in the office of Bazso Baz, there are a number of changes as well. There is a new map on the wall. This one covers Crow’s Foot and The Docks with large chunks of territory marked out in both districts. Behind his desk he’s added a shelf that holds several bottles of fine whiskey, a few finely made crystal tumblers, and a gleaming empty silver vase.
Bazso himself is sitting at his desk, hands folded atop the papers scattered there, as he regards the three Magpies standing across from him with a very self-satisfied smirk. He kind of lets the silence hang for a little bit and then says:
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, I’m glad to see that you’re at least following the bargain so far, not raising any protests when I tell you to come running.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. I’m glad to see it’s been profitable.
Rhi (as Bazso): Oh, very profitable, and you three are going to help me make it even more so.
Rhi: He shuffles around with his papers and comes up with a smaller map of Barrowcleft which is sort of the farming district.
Minna: I just want to note right now that Myra does not like Bazso nearly as much when he’s suggesting that they need to come running to him.
Rhi & Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Bazso): With my new territory in The Docks I’ve been able to expand my operations to include some smuggling, and I have a contact who works out of The Dagger Isles who would like a demonstration of what I would be able to provide. So, you all are going here…
Rhi: He taps a spot on the map.
Rhi (as Bazso): …to the Nyamaska Farms. They run one of the radiant energy farms out there, specialize in fruits and vegetables. You all are going to get in there, lift a decent amount of produce, but more importantly you are going to leave a back door for my people to be able to get in and out as they wish in the future. This of course means that you really can’t get caught while you’re in there.
Josie (as Minx): Delightful.
Kim (as Blaire): [smiling nervously] Okay!
Rhi: He eyes Blaire.
Rhi (as Bazso): If you do get caught, well, you’ll either be dead in which case you’re no longer my problem, in jail, again no longer my problem, but if you make enough of a mess that they are aware of a break-in and I lose my opportunity, you will still owe me and we will have to do this again some time.
Minna (as Myra): If we do this we’re square, correct?
Rhi (as Bazso): Yes.
Minna: She looks at the others.
Minna (as Myra): We can manage.
Rhi (as Bazso): I mean, you’ll have to. The agreement that I made with Minx here is that you will do me one favor upon request, no arguing, no questions asked.
Minna (as Myra): We’re neither arguing nor asking questions. I’m just letting you know, we’re able to do this.
Josie: Minx has just been staring back at him the whole time, just clearly biting her tongue.
Rhi (as Bazso): [exhales] Wonderful. I’m so glad you’re all so agreeable. Remira!
Rhi: He snaps his fingers a couple times and the door opens. A person comes in, looks like they themself at some point in their family history are from The Dagger Isles, kind of a tan, coppery skin, dark hair pulled back into a low ponytail. They slip inside.
Rhi (as Remira): Yes, Mr. Baz?
Rhi (as Bazso): These are the ones I told you about who are handling the smuggling operation. Remira here will be your contact point for anything else you might need. I’m rather busy with my expanding operations. Remira has some information about the farms, and once you finish the job you’ll check in with them to drop off the goods and provide information about the back door you left.
Josie (as Minx): Very well.
Rhi: Remira nods and holds the door open, clearly waiting for the three of you to exit.
Josie: Minx will leave.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: I don’t know if Blaire wants to leave?
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah. I think we’re just gonna leave. I don’t think Myra has anything particularly nice she can say right now to smooth this over, because Bazso chose to gloat.
Rhi: He’s doing well for himself.
Minna: He’s very gloaty and unpleasant to work with right now.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Minna: I just love that they’re all united right now. [laughs]
Rhi: Remira leads you across the catwalks down towards the ground floor. As they’re going they keep glancing over their shoulder at the three of you, just sort of stealing glances, kind of squinting at you a little, not suspiciously necessarily but they do keep glancing back.
Josie (as Minx): Not that I’m unused to the attention, but is there something you’re wondering about?
Rhi (as Remira): You all look kind of familiar. Have you been around here lately, the last couple months?
Minna (as Myra): I mean, we’ve been here, certainly. We’ve worked with Bazso before.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re in the paper.
Rhi: When Blaire says that they stop and snap their fingers.
Rhi (as Remira): That’s it! There’s where I recognized you from. I used to work at the Mirror.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh!
Rhi (as Remira): I must have seen you around there a few times.
Minna (as Myra): Were you there when it burned? Working there, I mean.
Rhi (as Remira): I was employed there, yeah. I wasn’t ‘there’ there, or else I…
Minna (as Myra): Oh, obviously. No, we were sorry to hear about that. The Mirror was good.
Rhi (as Remira): [airy] Yeah. Yeah, it was.
Kim (as Blaire): So, why the switch to Bazso?
Rhi (as Remira): Uh, well, paying work is kind of hard to come by for a typesetter. The Doskvol Daily doesn’t really need any more and there’s not a lot of book printers and places that are hiring.
MYRA: Especially not after something like that.
Rhi (as Remira): No. The competition was pretty fierce. Mr. Baz was paying, and well I needed to eat, so here I am.
Josie (as Minx): A familiar situation.
Rhi: As you guys get to the ground floor Remira walks you over to the front doors.
Rhi (as Remira): He doesn’t want you to bring the goods back here, he thinks it would be too much heat, so we’ll meet once the score is done at…
Rhi: They give you an address in Silkshore near one of the canals.
Rhi (as Remira): Just send me a message when you’re going in, and I will wait there for you to make the delivery.
Josie (as Minx): Though, if you’re feeling peckish, I suppose we could lift more than is necessary.
Rhi (as Remira): Uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea. If you take out too much they’ll notice and then we’ll lose this line.
Josie (as Minx): I apologize. I was merely being flippant.
Rhi (as Remira): Oh. Heh. Right, right… Anyway. Anything else that you need to know? I’ve done some research in that area. I know a little bit about the farming setup there.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I suppose just anything you know of the location itself is useful.
Rhi (as Remira): Yeah. The Nyamaska’s have had land down there for generations, and they have their farm up on one of the hills kind of between Barrowcleft and Dunslough. Big old property, lots of security… It’s gonna be tough to get in and probably tougher to leave a back door we can sneak through.
Josie (as Minx): Right. I assume what’s being asked for is not necessarily a literal back door.
Rhi (as Remira): Put a hole in the security that they’re not gonna find for a while, long enough for more of us to get in and take more stuff.
Minna (as Myra): What do you know about the security?
Rhi (as Remira): They’ve got wards, bars, locks, guards, all of the major farming families keep their property locked down pretty tight. They don’t want competitors stealing their soil mixtures or fertilizer or radiant energy arrangements, or even just the produce.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Rhi (as Remira): Anyway. I think that’s about all I know. I scoped the place out a couple times but didn’t really get too close and don’t have a ton of experience at scoping places out to break into them, so I don’t know, you all might see things that I missed.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. We should get to work then, I suppose.
Rhi (as Remira): Yeah. Like I said, just let me know when you’re gonna move and I’ll head to the meeting point.
Josie (as Minx): Though, one more thing.
Rhi (as Remira): Oh?
Josie (as Minx): It looks like things are on the up here, but if this life becomes tiresome we are also helping some friends from the Mirror. We can help you out if you need it.
Rhi: They kind of eye you for a second and then just shrug.
Rhi (as Remira): I appreciate it. I’ll keep it in mind.
Rhi: And then they head on inside.
Josie: All right. I guess we head out then.
Rhi: Gonna head for The Hound’s Paw to start strategizing?
Josie: Yeah!
Minna: Yes.
## The Hound’s Paw [0:13:40]
Rhi: All right. You make your way across the city over to Nightmarket and into The Hound’s Paw. It’s right around lunch time so there’s a few people in here, a decent number for the lunch time crowd. A few of the staff are moving around including Sophia. She is carrying a tray of drinks over to a table and she gives the three of you a shy smile and a nod when she sees you. The few times that you’ve seen her she seems to be doing better.
Minna: This by the way was the same score where Avrathi got shot, so she was there for that. [laughs]
Kim: Ohh. Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. She witnessed a lot.
Josie: She saw Phin just murder a woman.
Kim: She saw some shit.
Rhi: She is grateful to The Magpies for what you did. She is also kind of nervous around you.
Minna: Aww~! Bless.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: Rigney doesn’t greet you right away like he normally does. He is leaning over the bar talking with a young woman.
Madge: The woman that you see also has that copper skin, that look of The Dagger Isles. She has an oval face. She has black hair that she has done into three buns at the back of her head sort of like Rey’s style.
Others: [cheering and swooning]
Madge: She has small ears, but they kind of stick out a bunch. She has brown eyes, and the clothes that she’s wearing look a lot like she stole a noblewoman’s clothes and outfitted them to suit her needs better…
Rhi: [chuckles]
Madge: …so it’s like the colonial jacket and then slacks with a tunic underneath and very sturdy looking work boots that don’t look like they’ve been through too much wear and tear.
Rhi: [softly] I love her. Heh.
Kim: I love her already.
Minna: Nnn~
Josie: She’s so good.
Rhi: Rigney does notice you all and waves you over.
Rhi (as Rigney): So, you’d asked me to look into somebody who was good at…
Rhi: He glances at Needle, sort of waiting for her to fill in. [laughs]
Madge (as Needle): So, basically what I’ve heard is that you need someone to help you break into places.
Rhi (as Rigney): [nervously] You know, I was hoping for a slightly more discrete metaphor, but yes that is—
Madge (as Needle): I mean, you can’t be more discrete when you’re talking about robbing people.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi (as Rigney): Yes. I talked to some of my friends in the Cabbies, they asked a few people, and they connected me with Needle here. If you all want to chat with her I can bring you your usual drinks. What would you like?
Madge (as Needle): Could I just get something as strong as you could possibly get?
Rhi (as Rigney): How much money are you willing to spend?
Madge (as Needle): I have got all sorts of money for you to spend.
Rhi: All right.
[laughter]
Rhi (as Rigney): I’ll be over with your drinks in a minute.
Rhi: [laughing] He turns around, takes a key out of his pocket, and is unlocking a cabinet behind the bar to take out a three-quarters full bottle. It is just a green glass bottle with no label on it.
Madge (as Needle): All right. That looks like the stuff.
Kim: Woo.
Rhi: [smiling] There is something mysterious and expensive in there.
Kim (as Blaire): Top shelf.
Madge (as Needle): Thank you, darling.
Josie (as Minx): I have to say, I love your taste. I’m Minx, by the way. Pleasure to meet you.
Josie: She’s gonna offer her hand.
Madge: She’s gonna shake your hand.
Madge (as Needle): The name’s Needle. Well, most people call me Needle. My friends call me Devin, but we can get there eventually.
Josie (as Minx): Heh. Quite.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m Blaire.
Kim: She holds out a hand to shake.
Madge: All right. I’ll also shake Blaire’s hand.
Madge (as Needle): You are an adorable little thing, aren’t you?
Kim (as Blaire): [flustered giggling]
Minna: [giggles]
Josie (as Minx): [deliberately] I know. She is, but she won’t accept that.
Madge (as Needle): Really, I’m digging the horns. The horns make it.
Kim (as Blaire): Um, thanks? I was born with them.
Madge (as Needle): Ah, so they’re natural? I like it.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah? Yeah, I’m Tycherosi.
Madge (as Needle): Oh. I’ve never been there before. I’ll make a list.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s a little out of the way, but uh… Nn.
[laughter]
Rhi: Is Blaire just very flustered?
Kim: A little~
Rhi: And blushing? Oh gosh, this is so good.
Kim (as Blaire): Um… Yeah, it’s a nice place. People are nice.
Madge (as Needle): All right. I could do for a change. Nice is always better than, what would you call this, riddled with crime and corruption?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, that sounds accurate.
Minna (as Myra): I do have to ask, if you have money and you’re not a fan of crime and corruption, why the heck are you talking to us?
Madge (as Needle): Heh. So… Here’s the thing about where my money comes from. my family is rich. They are not fans of me or my hobbies. I’m currently on the little last bit of my stipend that I was given when I was kicked out and I’m making the most of it. Oh, of course I also supplement it with some of my own stash.
Josie (as Minx): I see, so this is a hobby then?
Madge (as Needle): Was a hobby, now a way of life.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, you know what they say, you do your dream job and you never really work a day in your life.
Josie: [laughs]
Madge (as Needle): [laughs] Oh, that is what they say.
Rhi: Rigney comes over with your drinks, the usual for Myra, Minx, and Blaire, and then he sets down a shot glass full to the brim. It’s a mostly clear liquid, kind of has a blueish tinge to it, and… Oh, what should it smell like?
Madge: Whatever it smells like, Needle is just knocking it back.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Kim: Oh my God. I love her.
Rhi: I feel like it smells like…
Kim: I’d like to imagine a floral scent.
Rhi: See, I was thinking gasoline.
Madge: [laughs] Even better.
Kim: Both?
Rhi: Both, yeah. It’s gasoline with floral notes…
Kim: ‘With a hint of lavender.’
Madge: Oh, I love it.
Rhi: That is the scent of this alcohol that Needle just slams back. Rigney tucks the tray under his arm and raises an inquisitive eyebrow at Needle, in a like, “So?”
Madge (as Needle): [coughs] It’s definitely different, isn’t it?
Rhi (as Rigney): Yes… Would you like something else to drink now that you’ve finished that one?
Madge (as Needle): I think I’m going to just stick with this, that one drink. Is that something that’s made in house?
Rhi (as Rigney): No, no-no-no, I don’t brew anything here.
Madge (as Needle): Oh, all right. Good, because if you did it would be a massive, massive hit against you, because you look like someone with taste.
Rhi (as Rigney): [chuckles] Hey, you asked for the most expensive, not the best.
Madge (as Needle): That is true.
Rhi: [laughing] He takes the empty shot glass away. He makes it back to the bar before his shoulders start shaking with laughter.
Madge: All right. So, with that out of the way, how about you explain to me this breaking and entering job that you’re gonna be doing?
Josie (as Minx): Well, it’s going to be a bit of a discrete one. We are hitting a produce farm. Getting in I suppose is not the hardest part. The hardest part will be getting out and leaving a back door as we go.
Madge (as Needle): Oh. So you’re sort of the primary party, the ones who are just setting it all up for everyone else to knock down?
Josie (as Minx): Precisely.
Madge (as Needle): I can work with that. So, produce, are we talking farmers?
Minna (as Myra): Radiant energy.
Madge (as Needle): Oh. That is a lot different than what I was counting on. That’s exciting. Do we know what sort of payout we’re looking at currently?
Minna (as Myra): Hmm… If you need a payout we can scrape together the money. We’re not getting one. It’s unfortunately a favor returned.
Madge (as Needle): All right. Who are you working with?
Josie (as Minx): I do think we should see how the job goes first before we simply spill our clients’ names everywhere, although I must say it looks promising.
Madge (as Needle): I’m mostly interested in who you’re working for because if it’s someone who has deeper coffers, if they’re not giving you anything even for a favor, that kind of says a lot more about him than it does about you. I’ve heard some rumors about some expansion that’s going on in this area and you would think that someone who’s so intent on expanding would be at least a little bit kind to the people he’s doing favors with.
Josie (as Minx): Quite.
Minna (as Myra): You would think.
Madge (as Needle): Oh. So he’s that kind?
Minna (as Myra): The ground rules on this mission are: We can only take a little, and what we take goes to our client. We are also primarily there to create a backdoor for them to use in the future. It is repayment of a favor that they did us.
Josie (as Minx): But you are not similarly indebted.
Minna (as Myra): There’s not extra taken in the job, so your payout is going to come from us.
Madge (as Needle): So, you said that whatever you took, that would just be going right back to him? That just means anything that they know that you took. Right? You could always take more.
Minna (as Myra): We could, but we’d be more likely to leave a trace behind.
Madge (as Needle): No one ever got anywhere by playing it safe, dear.
Minna (as Myra): You’re right. I suppose we have to think about how much we want to preserve this relationship in the future especially given our client’s current status.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I only intend to repay the debt and then…
Minna (as Myra): Repay the debt and burn this bridge?
Josie (as Minx): Precisely.
Minna (as Myra): I can think of a few more things we could get out of this than just produce, if so.
Josie (as Minx): What did you have in mind?
Minna (as Myra): Our friend was telling us that some of the security is to guard against other people getting information about what these radiant energy farms do. If we could take a little of that information and sell it on I’m sure that might be worth a bit as well.
Madge: Yeah, if you know a good fence.
Josie (as Minx): That is good thinking, though we’d have to find someone willing to actually buy that.
Minna (as Myra): Samples? Information about the layout? I’m sure we can find a way to make some coin off that.
Madge (as Needle): I know a lock pick who could make a whole lot of money off of selling off blueprints and schematics.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent. It sounds like we have a means of profit.
Rhi: For once. [laughs]
Minna: [laughing] I love that we give no shits about turning on him right now, because he’s been an asshole.
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Now, I suppose it’s simply the actual mechanics of the operation that are in question. I was hoping that if we are quiet enough we would simply be able to examine the various locks and perhaps create duplicate keys or a skeleton key to the place so that one needs only a disguise and walk in, for the backdoor at least.
Minna (as Myra): We’ll have to watch the guard patrols as well and see whether there’s any gaps there.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Madge (as Needle): I like the idea of a skeleton key. I’ve got some contacts who could help out with that pretty well.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent. We can in fact go forward with that. I think in that case we simply need to case the place.
Madge (as Needle): Sounds straightforward enough for me.
Josie (as Minx): You are very passionate about this hobby.
Madge (as Needle): One way to put it. Like I said, it’s the way I bring in the money now, so might as well go do the best I can so I can be the best out there. Right?
Josie (as Minx): Ooh. Ambitious.
Madge (as Needle): Of course I’m ambitious. What’s the fun in being ordinary?
Minna (as Myra): That’ll serve you well out here if it doesn’t get you killed.
Madge (as Needle): There’s always a risk of dying. It wouldn’t be fun if there wasn’t.
Rhi: In terms of gathering information, casing the joint, do you all just want to do something together as a group or do you want to split up and approach it from different angles?
Josie: Maybe it should be Blaire and Needle do something and then Minx and Myra do something. I’m thinking me and Myra try to…
Minna: What if we look for an angle on the guards?
Josie: Yeah. That’s what I was thinking.
Minna: Needle suggested bribery. I guess we could find a place where they all hang out and figure out something.
Kim: Figure out their vice?
Minna: Figure out what they might want. Yeah.
Kim: Do you think there is some kind of library that would have blueprints or schematics of the place, or no?
Madge: Usually with buildings and city councils, city governments, they have to have at least somewhat updated schematics of what’s going on with certain property, so we could definitely break into somewhere.
Kim: Yeah. Let’s break into a city hall place after hours and see if we can find schematics.
Rhi: It would probably be somewhere in Charterhall. That’s where most of the government records and archives are. Yeah, you could definitely do that.
## Blaire & Needle [0:27:08]
Rhi: There’s a Hall of Records in Charterhall, this big, imposing stone building where the majority of the important paperwork for the city is kept; blueprints, schematics, contracts, all that sort of stuff is filed here. I think I’m going to just say, because this is more fun, you’re able to get in. The break-in piece is gonna go off very smoothly. The actual finding the information is where I’ll have you make the roll to see what you’re able to locate. Go ahead and describe, just sort of cinematically, narratively, how the two of you break into the Hall of Records. What does that look like?
Kim: I like to imagine we have some kind of climbing gear, something that we can stick to our hands and knees that sticks to the walls so we can climb up to the top floor and just come in through a window.
Madge: Yeah. Basically, I’m imagining bracers with hooks on them.
Rhi: Yeah! That’ll just dig into the stone?
Madge: Yeah. That’s definitely something Needle would have and would have extras of to lend. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): So, how did you get into this?
Madge (as Needle): Do you want the broad strokes version of it, or do you want me to be more, um, specific?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… I don’t know. It’s a long way up. It’s up to you.
Madge (as Needle): Broad strokes: When I was a kid I liked shiny things. I made a habit of taking shiny things. Probably, point of order here is I grew up on a boat, one of those… You know the leviathans? I grew up on one of those things.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. Okay.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. So I grew up on a leviathan hunting ship and we would have all the gear there, and we would also have other various shiny things. You know, when you’re dealing with leviathan hunters you’re also dealing with the people who buy the leviathan blood, and they’re not the nicest people and they usually don’t notice when things go missing.
Kim (as Blaire): Fair.
Madge (as Needle): First time I stole something really big. I was dating a councilman’s daughter and she had this necklace, easily worth about 5 coin, and after we had one of our run-ins together I nicked it, and she didn’t even notice that it was gone for about a month after we broke up. Then after that it was just sort of fun, you know, seeing what I could get away with. Then I got caught, and my folks weren’t very happy about that one, but in between times before I got caught I started learning tricks. It’s gonna sound really awful, you know, one of those rich kids who just pretends to be poor to get along with the lower class, [laughs] because that’s kind of how it started.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, at least you’re self-aware enough to acknowledge it.
Madge (as Needle): Exactly. Yeah. See, you get it. A lot of the stuff I steal I end up selling off and the money I give to people, aside from my drinking money.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, yeah, then it evens out. That’s fair.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. Putting good karma out into the world, you know?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Exactly. What you put out comes back to you three-fold. That’s what my mom used to say.
Madge (as Needle): Oh? Mom sounds like she’s got a good head on her shoulders. I can see where you get it from.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww. Thanks.
Madge (as Needle): Of course. So, what do you do in the whole scheme of everything? I can tell that you’ve got your fancy-pants, and then you’ve got ‘mister…’ over there, and what do you do?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… Heh. I don’t know. I guess I’m sometimes the brains of the group. You know, Charterhall dropout, know some things, I like books.
Madge (as Needle): Oh~
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know… I like to, you know, capture ghosts into jars and then release them into The Deathlands, and sometimes I also like to do research into the occult, and you know stuff like that, and a little bit of vampirism on the side, but nothing really, um, crazy.
Minna: A little vampirism on the side?! What happened? [laughs]
Madge (as Needle): Um? You got a lot more interesting towards the end there. What was that about capturing ghosts?
Kim (as Blaire): Heheh. [nervously] That’s just my hobby. I like to rescue ghosts.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah, because they’re not very kind to those who have already passed on.
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Madge (as Needle): I like that.
Kim: Blaire starts blushing.
Kim (as Blaire): [softly] Thanks~
Rhi: [laughs] Fortunately it’s very dark.
Madge (as Needle): Because you know, out on the ocean, with us from The Dagger Isles, those ships are ancient…
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm?
Madge (as Needle): …and there’s usually a demon at the heart of those, or ghost of some sort.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm!
Madge (as Needle): And you’ve got to be nice to them or else nothing’s gonna go in your favor. I can definitely see the good karma that goes into treating those who have gone before us with a little bit more respect.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Exactly.
Madge (as Needle): We’re gonna circle around later to the vampirism thing, because I feel like that’s gonna be a whole other conversation that I don’t want to be climbing up a wall for?
Rhi: [giggles] I think the two of you have basically reached the window that you’re aiming for at this point.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m not a vampire! I just like reading about them!
Madge (as Needle): Okay. All right. Because… Then I would have had to ask you if you thought I looked tasty.
[snickering]
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Madge: And she climbs on in the window.
[giggling]
Kim: Does she wink? Tell me she winks.
Madge: She totally winks.
Kim: AGH!
Rhi: So, the two of you climb in the window, find your way to the room where blueprints are stored. There are 15 foot high ceilings with 15 foot high shelves that have just little square cubbies, and inserted into each is a rolled up blueprint.
Madge (as Needle): Oh. This reminds me of my ex’s place.
Rhi: There is a card catalog type thing that you can go through. Each of the little cubbies has a string of identifying numbers and letters as a code. Blaire, if you wanted to do Study…
Kim: Yes. Absolutely. I will Study this.
Rhi: Go ahead and make your roll.
Kim: Four.
Rhi: You two are able to find the blueprints for the Nyamaska estate. Unfortunately, they are about 15 years out of date. Now, it’s possible that they haven’t really made any modifications in the last 15 years, but odds are that these might not be 100% accurate. There might be small internal changes that could still prove to be problems, but things like locations of major rooms aren’t going to have moved much. You’ve got the basic layout. Are you planning on taking this or just copying down notes, sketching stuff out and putting it back?
Kim: I am gonna make a copy. That sounds safer.
Madge: I’m gonna keep it. I feel like she’s brought one of the long tubes for carrying large documents.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] Nice.
Kim: Blaire was in the middle of sketching it and Needle just takes it.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh—Okay. Never mind.
Madge (as Needle): You can finish it once we get back, and the lighting will probably be way better.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm. Yeah, and you know, we’ll have less of a chance of getting caught.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah, and then we could also probably have drinks or something.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, yeah, tea sounds nice. We can have a little study session if you want.
Madge (as Needle): That sounds like a good idea to me.
Kim (as Blaire): Heh. Okay.
## Minx & Myra [0:35:22]
Rhi: So, Minx and Myra, you two were gonna gather information next. Right?
Josie: Uh-huh.
Minna: Yes. We are going to look for an angle on the guards by trying to hang out with some guards.
Rhi: Okay, so trying to find a bar or something?
Minna: Like a hangout spot, because I’m sure there’s a place a lot of them go.
Rhi: You’re able to find a place, and then you can make some rolls inside to see what you learn. You spend some time poking around in Barrowcleft and getting some looks from people there. Barrowcleft is more of an insular neighborhood. People from outside the neighborhood don’t tend to come in very often, and they especially don’t tend to come in and ask friendly but pointed questions about guards.
Josie: Right. [laughs]
Rhi: You’re all kind of being eyed with a little suspicion, but you are able to find a tavern that is called… The Tipsy Mushroom.
Minna: Nn…
Josie: Aww!
Kim: Oh gosh. Cute.
Rhi: [laughs] The sign is a mug of ale with an upside-down mushroom floating in it. I’ll toss it to you all. what is it like inside The Tipsy Mushroom as the two of you head in?
Josie: You said it’s kind of like an insular neighborhood, right?
Rhi: Yeah. This is sort of the farming area of the city.
Josie: Right. I feel like this is the sort of bar that, you know, a lot of family people go to; not that they bring their families, but this is not a rough and tumble sort of bar nor is it fancy. This is kind of like, I don’t know, something that in the modern day might be a local chain sort of deal.
Rhi: It’s an Applebee’s, you guys.
Minna: Oh God!
Madge: [coughs laughing]
Josie: Oh man. Okay. I wasn’t going as far as Applebee’s, but yes, let’s do Applebee’s. [laughs]
Rhi: The two of you head in and again are getting a lot of looks because you’re not regulars. Some of the looks are curious, some of them are suspicious, and you have been told that this is where guards who work at some of the big radiant energy farms will come to drink after their shifts. So, you guys can roll whatever you’re gonna roll to see who you can find and what you can learn.
Minna: I feel like the angle here is like, not really giving a reason for being here, just kind of chatting until we find some things that they like to talk about and playing off of that.
Josie: Right.
Minna: It’s 5.
Josie: Yeah, I did not do so well. I got double 2s. I think my pseudo upper class affectation is showing.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, you just stick out like a sore thumb here. The bartender will give you a drink, but she does not stick around to chat with you. You try to strike up a conversation, they’re like “mm-hmm, that’s nice,” and then turn away and go back to whatever their conversation was. Nobody is willing to engage with you because you look like a fancy-pants. [laughs]
Josie: Yep. I forgot to dress down.
Rhi: Yep. It’s pretty good ale though.
Josie: That’s good at least.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a mushroom ale, but it’s pretty good. Myra though, you got a 5, right?
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You are able to start chatting with a man and a woman sitting at a table near the windows. You are able to start chatting with them a little bit, and they eventually let you pull over a chair and join their conversation. What do you ask them? how do you weasel your way in?
Minna: I think it’s almost more of a “I’m new in the area and I’m wondering what people do for fun around here” kind of thing.
Rhi: Oh, okay. At first you ask “So what’s fun to do around here?” and they’re both just kind of like “uh, this mostly,” but then they kind of talk about how there’s a lot more open spaces here, you can go for walks, the market is really kind of the big thing, the Barrowcleft market, it’s basically just a big, open air farmers market. Then the woman kind of scornfully mentions if you ask Kristov and Laura, the only fun thing to do around here is cards. The other guy rolls his eyes, and they start griping about how their coworkers are gambling their wages away every payday and constantly asking for loans. That’s pretty much what you get, is that there are a couple guards who have a gambling problem. any other questions you want to ask these two about their gambling coworkers?
Minna: What they look like.
Rhi: Over the course of the conversation you’re able to get descriptions of both of them.
Madge: [whispering] Ask if they’re dating each other!
Rhi: All right. Odds they are, evens they’re not.
Madge: [giggles]
Rhi: They are not.
Madge: Aww!
Rhi: I’m sorry. I rolled a 6.
Madge: I’ll write my fanfic.
Rhi: Okay. You’ve got some information about where they hang out, what they look like, what their gambling problems are. Is there any other information anybody wants to gather?
Josie: I can’t really think of anything more.
Rhi: Okay! What are we thinking for the type of score?
Madge: Infiltration, right?
Josie: Yep. Definitely.
Rhi: All right. This is a one die engagement roll.
Minna: Ohh…
Josie: Oh dear.
Madge: Ohh good… This is gonna be fine.
Rhi: I have good news. I rolled a 6.
Minna: [gasps]
Josie: Excellent!
## Score [0:41:32]
Rhi: You all find a vantage point to watch the estate for a while. You basically sit there for an hour watching the guards before you move in and you find where the gaps are. Actually, if you want, we can say that you create a gap. The reason you have such a good entrance is you create a gap by tying two of the guards down in a card game. [laughs]
Josie: Gotcha.
Minna: I love the idea that whoever is doing the card game lets them win for a little bit.
Rhi: Yeah. You pay off the dealer to be like “keep these two here.” Because of that, you now have this advantage where the four of you are able to make it in past the guards and you know that basically when you get around to the side door you have a lot of time to deal with the locks.
Josie: We need time with it anyway, because we want to be able to make a skeleton key for it.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Who’s good at that tinkering?
Minna: Blaire?
Madge: Hi! Oh yeah, Blaire.
Rhi: And Needle. Yeah. You’ve got a dedicated lock pick here now. [laughs]
Minna: Oh, Needle.
Josie: Yeah!
Rhi: The Lurk is actually built for this.
Minna: Oh, you’re right.
Madge: [laughs]
Rhi: All right. Basically, unless you get a critical success, it’s gonna be two separate rolls, one to pick the lock and one to make a—I don’t even know how you would do this—getting a cast of the lock.
Madge: Yeah. I’m thinking like sticking some sort of clay or some such.
Rhi: Or wax or something I think.
Madge: Or wax.
Rhi: Yeah, probably wax, that’s a little easier to work with. Yeah, you will have to make two rolls, one to open the lock, one to get the model of it.
Madge: Okay. Are we gonna be doing Tinker for this one?
Rhi: Yes.
Madge: Cool-cool. So, I got a 4.
Rhi: It takes you longer than you expected, and based on how you all had been watching the guards, in order to spend the time to get the wax mold of the lock it’s gonna be risky. Don’t forget you can push yourself, somebody can aid.
Madge: Yeah. I was about to ask: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Oh boy. Devil’s Bargains for Needle. Hmm.
Madge: Kehehe. Who has connections and a rich life to deal with…
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah… There is somebody in this house who will know your face if they see you.
Madge: If they see me. Uh… Let’s go ahead and take that.
Rhi: All right.
Madge: So, all three of those were 1s.
Kim: Nooo!
Rhi: Oh my God.
Josie: Oh no…
[sad and nervous laughter]
Rhi: Okay, here’s what I’m picturing. You pick the lock and ease the door open so that everyone can step inside. Basically, you have the door open, you’re inside this little side entrance hall, and you’re trying to get this wax model of the door, and the rest of the group is watching and keeping an eye on the time. You can hear footsteps getting closer and you just can’t get this wax to work with this lock. You basically just have to roll inside and they shut the door, so you lose the opportunity. You’re not able to get a model or a cast of that lock.
Madge: No…
Rhi: Three seconds after the door closes you hear footsteps come by, stop for a second at the door, and everyone’s just like [inhales] … and then they keep walking.
Madge (as Needle): [exhales]
Minna (as Myra): [exhales]
Josie (as Minx): Blast.
Madge (as Needle): All right. So, I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, the bad news.
Madge (as Needle): Okay. There’s not gonna be a cast of the lock to work with.
Josie (as Minx): All right…
Madge (as Needle): Good news is, we got in! Yay!
Rhi: [chuckles]
Minna (as Myra): Good job.
Kim (as Blaire): Yay.
Josie: Facepalm. Heh.
Rhi: All right. You all got here pretty late at night. The household is asleep. The way that I am picturing the layout of this is that there is the mansion and then kind of attached to it is the greenhouse where they grow all of their crops. The side door that you came in is fairly close to the greenhouse, but you are gonna have to sneak through a few hallways and rooms to get there.
Josie: I think we should just sneak over there, though.
Rhi: Do you want to do a group Prowl action?
Josie: Sounds good to me.
Multiple: Yeah.
Rhi: Who wants to lead that?
Josie: I can lead it.
Rhi: This is gonna be a risky action. Everybody roll Prowl and tell me what you get, and the highest result is the one that we will use.
Kim: Ooh. Six.
Madge: Three.
Minna: I’m so sorry, dear leader, I got a 2.
Josie: I also got a 2.
Rhi: [laughs] So you’re gonna take 3 stress…
Josie: Geez.
Rhi: …but Blaire got a 6.
Madge: Blaire carrying the weight of the team.
Rhi: [laughing] yep. Good job.
Kim: Woo! For once.
Josie: Well as we know, Blaire is pretty much the brains of this operation.
[laughter]
Kim: Book smart! I never said she had common sense.
Rhi: Tell me how Blaire is able to help everybody sneak across the house better.
Kim: I want it to be something arcane. Maybe she has some kind of stealth potion, or a cloak…
Madge: Blaire casts Pass Without Trace.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] I was gonna say, maybe you can look into the ghost field and you can see the echoes of where people walk…
Kim: Yeah~!
Josie: Ooh.
Rhi: …and you can hear creaky floorboards through the echoes.
Kim: It’s very videogamey. Yeah.
Rhi: You know where not to step, so you kind of point out places to avoid to everybody.
Kim: For sure. Yeah. I have my mask on this whole time and I’m just hand signaling everyone, like “yep, this way, here!”
Rhi: Yeah! SO, you all make it through the house without any trouble until you get to a lounge sitting area that’s done up in a very nature theme. There’s a lot of plant imagery, a couple potted plants of actual green plants in here which is very unusual. Set into one wall is a set of double doors made of stained glass, and whatever is on the other side of these doors is glowing. There’s light on the other side. These doors are casting this multicolored light across the room. These doors are also locked.
Josie: These ones would be good to have a mold for.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: So, Needle, if you wanna…?
Madge: I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: You can push yourself and somebody can help you if you want.
Kim: I’d be happy to assist if you would like.
Madge: Yeah. I would love that. … [hums]
Rhi: Oh no.
Madge: Three!
Rhi: Three? Okay. Your options are you can press on by seizing a risky opportunity or withdraw and try a different approach.
Madge: I’m gonna do it again.
Rhi: Okay. I think what happens is you’re working at it and these are really impressive locks. You know, you’ve spent a lot of your time looking at locks, and locks that have been in place for a while have some scratches around them from where people miss with the key and they scrape it up a little bit. These have very few scratches on them. they clearly just put in a new set of locks, and these are top of the line, so they are giving you some serious trouble. But yeah, you can press on with a risky opportunity. What is causing this to be risky is you’re all sort of huddled around the doors and you hear floorboards creaking upstairs as someone is walking around.
Madge: Egh.
Josie: I’m gonna take up a position by the door leading into this room.
Rhi: To ambush just in case?
Josie: Correct.
Rhi: Yeah. All right. Go ahead and try it again.
Madge: Another 3. [laughs]
Rhi: Oh no. As you’re working on this one of your picks slips and hits something…
Madge: No!
Rhi: …and a needle shoots out from the thing and jabs into your hand.
Madge: [yelps] Ah…!
Josie: But you’re safe, because you are Needle!
Madge: I’m immune!
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Are you okay?
Rhi: Unfortunately no, because it’s definitely starting to burn a little bit around there.
Madge (as Needle): Gah.
Rhi: So, you’re either gonna take level 2 harm, Poisoned…
Madge: Whaaat?
Rhi: There’s a burning and then it’s starting to be a numbness spreading through your hand.
Madge: [seethes shakily]
Rhi: Not like totally numb, but that pins and needles feeling.
Madge: [laughs]
Rhi: Every time I say needle now I’m gonna just be wincing a little bit. But you can resist.
Madge: No, I’ll just take it.
Rhi: Okay. You’re gonna be at -1 on anything where you need to basically do both hands.
Madge: The worst~ Okay.
Madge (as Needle): Okay. So, this is new. This system is obviously more advanced than I was anticipating. This is not great. Uh…
Kim (as Blaire): Are you okay?
Madge (as Needle): No. I kind of got poisoned a little bit. Look. Look at my hand.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear.
Kim (as Blaire): I can help if you want. I might have something on me that’ll help.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah, you wanna kiss it better?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, I, I mean…
[snickering and giggling]
Madge: She’s giving you a dumb smirk right now.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): That’s not gonna help. I’m talking—Well, I might have some bandages, or I might have herbs, anything…
Madge (as Needle): How about we just press on for right now, huh?
Kim (as Blaire): [weakly] Okay.
Madge (as Needle): Does anyone else want to try picking this lock, because I’m kind of bum right now.
Kim (as Blaire): I can give it a shot. I’m pretty good.
Kim: I would like to roll Tinker.
Rhi: Okay. it’s gonna continue to be risky.
Kim: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: God. I want it to be… I’m just trying to think of how to formulate this mechanically, but I want it to be something where Blaire is like really flustered and anxious and wanting to impress Needle with this.
Minna: Augh!
Multiple: Aww!
Rhi: I’m just not sure what…
Kim: Right. It becomes obvious that I’m trying to show off?
Rhi: Yeah!
Kim: Nah, that’s not very good. It’s just like, I’m obviously looking to impress here and it shows.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Minna: It’s almost like one of your vices has shown up.
Rhi: Yeah. I like that. You’re being deliberately, unnecessarily kind of a showoff right now.
Kim: Okay, 5.
Rhi: I’ll tell you what the consequence is after, but describe to me how you open this lock and do it in such a way that it’s super obvious that you’re showing off.
Kim: I unhook my lock pick from my belt and I kinda twirl it around my finger a couple times.
Madge: Oh no. [giggles]
[laughter]
Kim: I might toss it up into the air and then catch it in the same hand, you know, and then I start picking the lock once I’m done doing sleight of hand tricks with it. [laughs]
Rhi: The complication is just as the lock goes click and is open those footsteps are on the stairs.
Kim: Yikes. Ooh, I just got chills.
Rhi: It doesn’t sound like somebody is rushing down to come and try and get you, it also doesn’t sound like someone is inexpertly sneaking, it just sounds like somebody is unable to sleep and maybe they’re going to get a snack in the kitchen.
Kim: Relatable.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But somebody is awake, and coming down to the same level as you. Blaire pushes open the doors and a light unlike anything that any of you have ever seen before fills the room.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for listening. If you’re enjoying the show please consider supporting us on Patreon, leaving us a review on iTunes, or just going on social media and yelling about us a lot. We’re looking to reach even more listeners and do even more exciting things in 2019, but we can’t do it without your help.
Speaking of exciting things, I have a really awesome announcement. Tyler, a long time Twitter friend of the show, volunteered to transcribe the first couple episodes of The magpies for us. They finished the first transcript recently and it’s posted on our site. Visit magpiespodcast.net and click on Transcripts to check it out. I cannot thank Tyler enough for their generosity in doing this. If you need a transcriptionist, reach out to them on Twitter at @Tyler_MoonSage. There will be a link to their profile in the show notes.
If you want to help us add more transcripts, please consider backing us on Patreon. Once we hit $300 a month I’ll be able to afford to hire Tyler and other transcriptionists to transcribe our archives and then keep up with all of our new releases. Accessibility is really important to me, and providing text transcripts is a huge step in that direction.
In other news, continue to tune in to Character Creation Cast on the One Shot Network to hear me, Minna and Josie talk about building characters in Blades in the Dark. Episodes 1 and 2 of the series are up now. We had a great time building a power-hungry cult full of disaffected rich kids and talking about just how terrible they all are. I’ll include links to both episodes in the show notes.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity:
Howard Brown Health is a Chicago based organization that focuses on health care for queer people. They do research and education as well as provide direct health services to the community including primary care, mental health care, and HIV/AIDS care, all available on a sliding scale for low income or uninsured patients. They have several clinics throughout Chicago as well as a youth center and three resale shops whose proceeds support the group’s mission. If you have a few dollars to spare, consider donating, either to Howard Brown or to a local queer-supporting charity in your area.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:39]
Rhi: Blaire pushes open the doors and a light unlike anything that any of you have ever seen before fills the room. It is warm, and golden, and you all look into this greenhouse… For the three magpies, Amancio has a little green house attached to his house where he has a single small radiant energy tree that produces light kind of like this, enough to keep his herb garden alive. All of the plans just said greenhouse, so you were expecting something similar, a large glass room. This is made of glass, but it is not just open, empty glass. Curving overhead encasing this entire space is a massive glass dome aquarium… full of fish that glow with the light of the sun.
[gasps, squealing]
Josie: Whaaat? That’s fucking bonkers.
Minna: So, it’s like radiant energy fish?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. That is a thing. That is the legit description of this farm in the book. This is why I have wanted to have people come here ever since I read it. It’s the coolest fucking thing.
[excited noises]
Josie: That’s super rad.
Kim: [smiling] I’m sorry for shrieking, this is not good audio, but that is amazing.
Rhi: Here, let me find it. “The Nyamaska family pioneered the technique of building an aquarium full of radiant fish that arched over a greenhouse. The living light allows growing gardens of fresh fruit and vegetables inside the mansion’s security.”
So, you step into this massive greenhouse that is illuminated with—none of you would know what actual sunlight looks like, but for us—it’s not as bright as full sunlight, but it is still pretty bright. It is bright enough for grass to be growing underfoot. There are fruit trees in neat rows. There are raised beds of vegetables and herbs and berry bushes. It smells amazing in here. For all of you this is probably one of the most beautiful places you’ve ever seen.
Kim: I’m gonna take out my journal and just immediately start drawing these fish.
Josie: I think Minx might just straight-up be struck dumb, just entranced by this for a while. Fuck staying behind. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, just standing in the doorway, staring.
Josie: Running my fingers through the trees a little bit.
Rhi: Yeah. I think everybody has a moment of “holy shit…” Eventually you all kind of shake it off and start moving into the space a little more to start looking around and seeing what there is to see. Tell me kind of what everybody gravitates to. Where do you go? What do you do?
Josie: I gravitate towards the fruit.
Rhi: Okay. There is an apple tree kind of near the doors.
Josie (as Minx): There’s so many… I’ve never seen so many in one place.
Minna: I just love that we’re in the closest thing that Duskwall has to an Eden and there’s an apple tree in it.
Josie: Mm-hmm. [laughs]
Rhi: There’s a few apple trees.
Josie: We were told to take some of this stuff. Right?
Rhi: Yes. Your orders were to take enough to prove to Bazso’s connection that “yeah, I’m legit, I can actually get this stuff,” but not so much that anything would be noticed as having gone missing.
Josie: Can I have a small, dainty basket?
Rhi: [laughs] I think you can find a basket somewhere around here.
Josie: I’ll just load it up with a few apples. One of them is for me. I’m gonna eat one.
Rhi: Minx is picking apples. What’s everybody else doing?
Josie (as Minx): [hums happily]
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna collect a soil sample.
Rhi: Okay. Myra is actually managing to focus on—[laughs] I mean Minx is too!
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: In my own way.
Minna: It also gives her a chance to dig her fingers into dirt that is probably the most alive dirt she’s ever felt in her life.
Rhi: Yes. That’s true.
Minna: Do I need to mark something off for this? I don’t know what I would mark off.
Rhi: Soil samples? No. I imagine you’re just getting a couple little vials or pouches. That’s not enough to count as one unit of load, unless you’re getting a lot of soil samples.
Minna: Yeah. I just didn’t know if I needed to have something on me for that or if that’s small enough that it doesn’t matter.
Rhi: No, I think you can do it. I will say, I think I’m gonna have you make some kind of roll to make sure that you can do it in such a way that isn’t gonna leave signs behind that anything was disturbed.
Minna: Okay. I wanna say either a Finesse or a Study.
Rhi: I would say either one of those.
Minna: I’m better at Study. That’s a 5.
Rhi: You’re able to get the soil samples, but I am gonna start a clock. The person who’s awake…
Kim: Can it just be a Cindy Lou Who situation?
Josie: Who is no more than two.
Rhi: [laughs] We’ll see. It’s probably somebody who recognizes Needle though.
Madge: [laughs nervously]
Rhi: yeah, so Needle, what are you up to?
Madge: Needle is gonna be wandering between the rows taking note of each type of fruit that’s there, trying to place if she recognizes any of these things.
Rhi: I think she definitely does recognize some of this. How well off–? Was your family nobility or were they rich merchants?
Madge: They were rich merchants.
Rhi: Okay. Your family would have sprung for this kind of stuff on special days, birthdays, holidays, things like that. This was not the kind of stuff you would have been able to have regularly, but you know, you’ve had strawberries and blueberries, and there’s probably some citrus trees growing here that you’ve had before. You recognize a number of the fruits and things here, and it brings up memories of special holidays and celebrations with your family.
Madge: Yeah. I’m gonna take some strawberries, because I feel like those were my favorite.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: Okay. You’ve got a pocket full of strawberries. I will say, all of the fruits and vegetables in here are to us in the real world would look sort of stunted or undergrown.
Madge: Yeah, they’re dinky.
Rhi: Everything is just sort of smaller, but they’re ripe and healthy and whatnot.
Madge: I want to specify that I’m making sure to grab something from every other bush so that it’s not obvious.
Rhi: Yeah! You’re not just grabbing a handful from one. Yes, I figured.
Madge: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: I’m assuming Minx is doing similarly.
Josie: Yeah. I’m not taking a lot, I’m just taking a small sample.
Rhi: A few from a few different trees so it’s not super obvious. Blaire? What are you doing?
Kim: I am still way the fuck into these fish. I know that’s not really productive, so I’m trying to think of ways…
Minna: I mean, you could be sketching the layout of it as well.
Kim: Okay. Yeah. I could do that. I was thinking it’s gonna be hard for me to harvest the fish, but then I remembered that I always have jars on me. I could try taking a fish. Maybe?
Minna: Oh shit.
Rhi: You would have to find an access point. You know how aquariums will have those tunnels where it’s just a glass dome and the water is all around you?
Kim: Oh, that’s what this is. Okay.
Rhi: It’s that, but greenhouse sized. The space that the fish have between the two panes of glass is probably like a foot, foot and a half. It’s a thin, massive wide aquarium. Now, that said, there probably are some access points, because they need to be able to feed the fish and restock. You would have to go searching for them if you wanted to grab a fish.
Kim: Can I bring a fish home…? I want to.
Rhi: Uh, I mean, you’re gonna have to… How alive do you want the fish to be? [laughs]
Kim: Very? If possible, I’d like to bring it home alive. I have jars.
Rhi: You’re gonna have to find… Well, if you have a spirit jar you could get some water and a small fish in there. Okay. First you’re gonna have to find the access point.
Kim: Should I roll a Survey for that?
Rhi: Sure, if you want. This is still risky.
Kim: [quietly] Fishy, fishy, fishy… Oh, 3.
Rhi: Oh geez.
Kim: I’m sorry I’m not helpful.
Rhi: [smiling] It’s okay.
Madge: Yeah.
Kim: [chuckling] I know what I like and I must follow it.
Rhi: You’re all just kind of spending a lot of time down here. Blaire, you just wander off along the edge of the aquarium looking for access points. You’re not able to find one, but it’s all taking a lot of time. This person… Nobody’s watching the house. [laughs]
Madge: Can I wander over to Blaire at one point? [smiling]
Kim: [gasps] Aquarium date~!
Madge: [laughs]
Kim: [shrieks]
[laughter]
Madge: I am here to just embarrass Kim.12:48
Rhi: And thus did Kim’s little gay heart expire.
Kim: [smiling] It’s my favorite kind of date, you guys. I’m sorry~!
Madge: Yeah. Needle will come up and stand next to Blaire and sort of nudge her a little bit and offer a strawberry.
Madge (as Needle): So, it’s a really nice view, ain’t it? Lots of pretty fish swimming around, pretty girl, pretty food…
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… What? Heh.
Madge (as Needle): You’re pretty, and the fish…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, yeah, the fish. Um…
Madge (as Needle): Has anyone flirted with you this intensely before? Just so I know where my boundaries are here. Because, you know…
Kim (as Blaire): I-Is that what we’re doing? Heh. Uh…
Madge (as Needle): That was sort of my intention. Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Um… No, not really.
Madge (as Needle): [laughs] That’s kind of embarrassing for me, isn’t it? Uh… Coming on too strong.
Kim (as Blaire): No, no! This is fine! It’s okay. It’s okay.
Madge (as Needle): You sure? I can always, you know, back off a little bit if it’s making you uncomfortable.
Kim (as Blaire): No. No, no, it’s okay.
Madge (as Needle): Because, you know, you’re nice.
Kim (as Blaire): Heh. You’re nice too. Um… How’s that finger? Are you doing any better? Are you okay?
Madge (as Needle): Oh. Yeah! It’s still a little bit swollen and everything, but it could be worse.
Kim (as Blaire): Heh.
Madge (as Needle): I can still wiggle the other four, so that’s kind of the important thing when you think about it. You know?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Madge (as Needle): That’s like a total of nine?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I mean, not as good as 10, but uh…
Madge (as Needle): Eh. The other one will come back, hopefully.
Kim (as Blaire): I hope. I mean, like I said, I’ve got stuff.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. I’ve got a healer that I go to sometimes. Getting hurt on jobs is kind of a strange thing, to be perfectly honest. I don’t get hurt very often on jobs like these, so that’s new.
Kim (as Blaire): Heheh. I get hurt a lot. Heh.
Madge (as Needle): Really? Do you wear any sort of extra padding or anything to keep you from…?
Kim (as Blaire): Uhh…
Kim: She thinks back to all the scores, and there’s a montage in her head of her getting hurt.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh? No.
Madge (as Needle): So, when we’re done with all this, how about we get armor for you?
Kim (as Blaire): Um, yeah, yeah, that would be good.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. You know, don’t want that pretty little face going to waste.
Kim: Blaire’s blushing so hard you guys.
Kim (as Blaire): [giggles] Sorry. I’m not usually like this. [laughs nervously] I don’t know what’s… Yeah. You know?
Madge (as Needle): I am fully aware. I was not always this smooth.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t believe that.
Madge (as Needle): So, first time that I tried flirting with someone—
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs]
Madge (as Needle): Do you want to hear this story? Because it’s really fun.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah!
Madge (as Needle): Okay. First time I tried flirting with someone, it was on the ship. We were on one of the leviathan hunters. I got the sweets for this cabin boy and I decided I was, you know, gonna try my luck. He wasn’t dating anyone. I wasn’t dating anyone. I went over to give it my all and I tripped over my own feet.
Kim (as Blaire): Heh.
Madge (as Needle): And I said, “well, I guess I’ve sort of fallen for you now, haven’t I?” Everything sort of went downhill from there pretty fast.
Kim (as Blaire): So, you didn’t really get a date out of that?
Madge (as Needle): No. Not even a little bit.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs]
Madge (as Needle): He left once he got back to shore and didn’t come back to the ship.
Kim (as Blaire): Aw. That’s too bad.
Madge (as Needle): It got really awkward when the boss’s daughter tries coming on to you. So…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I uh… Sorry. I don’t really have a story like that, I don’t think.
Madge (as Needle): [laughs] No. I wasn’t sharing so that you could share, I was just sharing for the sake of… Um. Sometimes I talk just to fill silence, and it’s really not that great.
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, that’s okay.
Madge (as Needle): No. it gets really awkward, because then you feel like you have to talk off of my talking and then we get to this place where we don’t know what to say to each other… I’m gonna just have another strawberry. Do you want one?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! Yeah, that’s fine.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. Let’s have that.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Rhi: [giggling] So the two of you wander off, eating strawberries, awkwardly glancing at each other and blushing.
Josie: Minx is over by Myra with a fucking proud mom look on her face.
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): They grow up so fast.
Kim: She never thought this would happen. [laughs]
Minna: I think Myra turns to her, like:
Minna (as Myra): Hmm?
Josie (as Minx): Oh. It’s just awkward adorableness happening. That’s all.
Minna (as Myra): Oh. Those two.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Is there anything more you wanted to grab in here?
Rhi: We have some fruit, we’ve got some apples and some strawberries, we got some soil samples.
Madge (as Needle): [distant] Oi! Have you guys looked over here yet? They have oranges!
Minna (as Myra): Agh… Please don’t shout.
Rhi: They do have oranges over by where Needle and Blaire are.
Josie: I’m gonna go grab an orange.
Rhi: [chuckles] You go grab a few oranges. You’ve got room in your basket.
Minna: I think she follows.
Minna (as Myra): So, what about this backdoor we’re preparing for them? I don’t think we’ve really got enough for them yet.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Well, the main issue is the door we just came through. That is the biggest hindrance. If we can disable that without anyone knowing…
Minna: Could we look around to see if there’s maybe any other way in here besides that door?
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Minna: That’s gonna be a Survey. I think I’m actually gonna push myself on the Survey.
Josie: You know what? How about I help you?
Minna: Or that.
Rhi: You can do both.
Kim: Both. Both is good.
Rhi: So, Minx will take 1 point of stress, Myra will take 2.
Minna: That’s a 6.
Rhi: Okay! You basically have to go clear over to the other side of the greenhouse, but set against one wall there is a break in the glass and there is a small, brick shed against the back wall. The door is not locked on this side. You open it up and it’s storage. There are various gardening implements and some more baskets and things to collect fruits and vegetables in. Then, on the opposite wall from where you came in is another door.
Josie: Oh!
Rhi: This whole thing was not marked on the blueprints.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, well this is convenient.
Minna: Is it locked? Could we unlock it from this side?
Rhi: I mean, logically, yes.
Minna: Can I slowly peek my head out to see where it comes out?
Rhi: Yeah. You look out. Maybe some of you have thought of this, maybe you’ve all been too caught up in the grandeur of this place, but there is not a big, glowing beacon on the hill where this estate is. You poke your head out and glance around, and you realize the entire outside of the greenhouse is painted black so none of the light escapes. Nobody else can see it. The door is almost completely concealed. It’s a very tight seam around the edges, and when it’s closed, you’re looking at it and you can tell this is probably almost invisible, particularly because it’s a pitch black door in a pitch black wall in a world that is constantly dark.
Josie: Fair.
Rhi: I’m gonna need you to make a Prowl roll to see how sneaky you are. It’s gonna be risky.
Minna: Okie-doke. What does a Devil’s Bargain look like here?
Rhi: Oh. Hmm-hmm-hmm?
Josie: I don’t suppose I’m able to assist on this one, am I?
Rhi: Yeah, you can help.
Josie: Oh. Totally, I’m gonna do that.
Rhi: You can describe how you assist. Devil’s Bargain, let me think… Hmm. I don’t know. Anybody have ideas?
Minna: You can always tick up that clock again.
Kim: I was gonna suggest the clock, or is that too much of a cop out?
Rhi: Yeah. Let’s do that. You all have spent a lot of time just wandering around in here. I think that will be the Devil’s Bargain, that the clock is gonna tick up one.
Minna: Okay. That’s a 5.
Rhi: With the Devil’s Bargain?
Minna: Yes, with the Devil’s Bargain.
Rhi: Okay. Minx, how are you helping with this, with her sneaking out through this door?
Josie: I think I’m following behind and looking in the directions she can’t be looking, and then also helping to open the door quietly.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, I think you’re still back in the doorway. Myra, I think you’ve stepped outside a bit to get your bearings and figure out, okay, this is where it is, this is how people would access it, basically mapping out what you’re gonna tell Bazso. You have finished making your map, you kind of nod at Minx like “I’m coming back in,” and you go to take a step forward and a hand closes on your arm.
Josie: Uh-oh.
Rhi: You are in a desperate position because a guard just came around the bend and has grabbed you.
Kim: Ah!
Josie: Uh… Pocket sand!
[giggling]
Rhi: Yeah. Roll it. It’s still desperate. Whoever is reacting is in a desperate position. You can mark experience.
Josie: I mean, if Myra wants to help me she can, but…
Minna: I don’t know how I would help you with pocket sand.
Rhi: Well, you could kind of jerk your arm to the side and try to throw the guy off balance.
Minna: Oh. Yeah. I can take the stress to help.
Josie: Yay. [laughs] I got a 5.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: You do it, but there’s a consequence.
Minna: What does pocket sand do again?
Rhi: It’s trance powder. It sends the target into a sort of pleasant trance. Gosh… I just like this complication so much. You throw the trance powder and it hits the guy in the face, but it also hits Myra.
Josie: Oh no!
Kim: [gasps]
Madge: Nooo~
Josie: [laughing] Sorry Myra.
Rhi: Myra does not get a full dose of it, but Myra, you are basically gonna take level 2 harm, Dazed, and you’re basically just on a -1 on most things, because you are…
Josie: Pretty stoned.
Rhi: Yeah. You are just tripping right now, which is gonna make going back inside really fun. You are gonna be like oh, it’s so pretty~, I wanna go look at the fish.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: If this was not a place you had to flee from you could just prop Myra up in front of the aquarium wall and leave her there for three hours.
Minna: On the one hand, we really have to get out of here smoothly, so I should resist this. On the other, God damn that’s really fun. I’ll just be slightly woozy if I resist it.
Josie: That would be so good, because Myra doesn’t let her defenses down like this normally, right?
Minna: She doesn’t.
Rhi: It’s not your consequence to resist, though, it’s Minx.
Minna: Oh fuck.
Josie: Oh… Wait. What do I actually do to resist it?
Rhi: Josie, you would need to roll…
Minna: Would it be Prowess?
Rhi: Yeah. I think since this is a physical thing that you were doing that caused this complication, you’re gonna need to resist with Prowess.
Josie: I’m kind of tempted not to.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: [smiling] It is your choice.
Josie: I think I’m not gonna resist, because it takes Minx a minute to realize what she just did.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx rushes forward to grab the guy and drag him inside, and then it takes that long for her to notice that Myra is still just standing there looking up at the stars slack jawed.
Josie: Aw. [laughs] I’m gonna take the guard around the bend a little ways, just sort of sit him down, point him to look up at the stars, and just be like:
Josie (as Minx): Have a nice nap.
Rhi: Okay. You’re just gonna leave him outside?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie (as Minx): Myra, you doing okay?
Minna (as Myra): It’s just… such a lovely evening, I don’t notice often enough.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. It’s… It’s beautiful. Let’s head back inside for a moment, Myra. Let’s get this setup and you can take a nice rest.
Minna (as Myra): All right. I’ll do that.
Rhi: She doesn’t move until Minx guides her back inside.
[laughter]
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Myra, when you get back inside—
Minna: Oh God. Overload. Yeah.
Rhi: –your mind is blown all over again.
Minna (as Myra): Oh glory, I’ve never seen anything like this.
Madge (as Needle): Oh. What happened to her?
Josie (as Minx): She took the collateral damage of some trance powder. I had to deal with a guard. We should wrap up here and…
Madge (as Needle): Oh. Uh… Yeah? That sounds like exactly what we should be doing. Let’s make ourselves scarce.
Josie (as Minx): yes. Let’s sabotage the lock back here, so it’s a literal backdoor, and then be gone from this place.
Madge: Yeah, let’s sabotage it, because I’m not getting that- [laughs] I’m not, I’m not gonna be able to get it from my hand being messed up. It’s -1, so I only roll one die to mess with it?
Rhi: Yeah. You can still push yourself or get assistance.
Kim: Would you like an assist?
Madge: An assist would be really good.
Kim: All right. I’ll assist you.
Madge: Yay. Holy mother… Oh…
Rhi: Is that good or bad?
Madge: [laughing] I got a 2 as my highest.
Rhi: Oh my God.
Minna: Honey!
Josie: [seethes]
Kim: Madge…
Josie: This is not a good night.
Madge: [laughing] I’ve swapped my dice three times!
Rhi: So, you’re all kind of clustered around the door while Needle is working trying to sabotage it, and then from across the greenhouse you hear someone go:
Rhi (as ???): Is… Is someone here?!
Kim (as Blaire): No?!
Josie (as Minx): [laughing] No! Blaire, no.
Kim: [laughs]
Madge (as Needle): Blaire, Blaire, you’re adorable. Not right now, please.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispering] Okay. I’m sorry.
Madge: Cover your mouth, and I try getting everyone out the door.
Rhi: Needle, it is a voice that you recognize.
Madge: [wincing] Oh no.
Rhi: Who is this person? How do you know them?
Madge: Oh gosh. Um… Because she’s a merchant family, rich merchant family, she’s probably been to this estate for parties before.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. I think this is one of the Nyamaska daughters…
Madge: Oh yeah.
Rhi: …and you’ve danced with her at a few parties.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Kim: [whispering] She’s an ex.
Rhi: Well, I mean, I can leave this up to Madge. I don’t know if it was an ex necessarily. Maybe more like a fling.
Madge: More of a might have been.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: So yeah, Needle’s herding you all out the door.
Madge: I will stay behind, and I’m gonna try and break the lock again, if that’s okay with everybody.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Madge: I’m gonna do it with just my one. That’s a 5 though!
Rhi: Okay. You are able to sabotage the lock in such a way that it will still lock but it’s now much easier to pick. You finish up with it, you let out a sigh of relief, “okay, got it, done.” You stand up, and then you hear from behind you:
Rhi (as Nyamaska Daughter): Devin?
Madge (as Needle): Oh…!
Madge: She’s gonna turn around and sort of tuck her hands behind her to hide the one that’s all messed up, and when she talks she doesn’t have the accent anymore.
Rhi: Oh?
Madge (as Needle): [cheery] Hi! It’s been forever, hasn’t it? Hi~
Rhi: I think her name is Carissa.
Madge (as Needle): Carissa… Heh. Hi~
Rhi (as Carissa): What… are you doing here… in my greenhouse, in the middle of the night?
Madge (as Needle): [softly] I missed you.
Rhi: … Roll me a fucking Sway.
[laughter]
Kim: Oh-ho-ho…
Rhi: [claps, laughing] Jesus. Oh, I love it.
Madge: There’s so much lying right now. There’s so much lying.
Rhi: Oh God. Okay. This is risky still.
Madge: Four.
Rhi: She kind of stares at you just in shock for a couple seconds, and you’re like “oh shit, she’s not buying it, she’s not buying it,” and then she just lights up in this big smile.
Rhi (as Carissa): [giggly] I missed you too. This is the stupidest way of coming to see me again.
Madge (as Needle): You know I’m unconventional.
Rhi (as Carissa): I mean, yes, yes you are.
Rhi: She loops her arm through yours and starts to walk you away from this door.
Madge: Cool. I’m gonna kick the door shut as we get further away from it.
Rhi: Okay. The other three of you are waiting outside and the door just closes.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… I-Is she okay?
Minna (as Myra): What…? What happened? Why is the door…?
Josie (as Minx): I think she knows what she’s doing.
Minna (as Myra): Why… Why is the light gone?
Kim (as Blaire): The door closed.
Josie (as Minx): We’re going home, Myra. That’s why.
Kim (as Blaire): But… Not without Needle.
Josie (as Minx): Well, we’ll need to figure out whether we’re gonna wait here or head around. It doesn’t sound like the alarm has been raised, which is good.
Rhi: How long do you wait?
Josie: I think maybe about 15 minutes.
Minna: I think Myra at this point is leaning heavily on whoever is holding her up. Neither of you has probably had that much physical contact with Myra like this.
Kim: Ever.
Josie: She’s probably leaning up against Minx, because Minx is taller, but Minx honestly looks kind of perturbed about it. She’s just sort of like:
Josie (as Minx): Is this really Myra right now?
Kim (as Blaire): You hit her with the trance powder. You tell me.
Rhi: [smiling] So, while the three of them are waiting, Carissa is leading you upstairs, Needle. She’s just kind of whispering…
Rhi (as Carissa): You’re gonna have to sneak back out in the morning. My parents are not gonna stand for this.
Madge (as Needle): Oh, you know I’ve snuck out hundreds of times before. I’m sneaky. It would help me out a lot if you made sure the alarms didn’t go off while I was sneaking out?
Rhi (as Carissa): I can take care of that in the morning, can’t I?
Madge (as Needle): I mean, you could, but I don’t want you to wake up and have to worry about all that stuff. I want you to be relaxed.
Rhi: Give me another Sway.
Madge: Oh gosh.
[laughter]
Kim: Oof.
Madge: She has no Sway.
Rhi: Now, to be fair, she wants to believe you.
Madge: Oh man.
Rhi: So I’m gonna give you controlled.
Madge: Two.
Rhi: You can either keep trying this line of questioning or you’re gonna have to withdraw and try a different approach.
Madge: I’m gonna withdraw.
Rhi (as Carissa): No, don’t—I’ll worry about it in the morning. Don’t worry about it.
Madge (as Needle): If you don’t wanna do it, I can just handle it right now.
Rhi (as Carissa): I mean… How would you know where anything is?
Madge (as Needle): I know my way around here. I mean, I noticed things when I was here before, and you know I’ve got magic fingers.
Rhi: She kind of giggles and blushes a little.
Rhi (as Carissa): All right, but don’t keep me waiting too long.
Rhi: She winks at you and scurries on up the stairs.
Madge: [laughing] Oh my God.
Kim: She’s such a heartbreaker.
Madge: [giggles, deep breath] Okay. Yeah. I’m gonna go find the alarm.
Rhi: Okay. You do, I will allow that. Since you have been here before you do know where it is.
Madge: I’m gonna push myself. Yeah. Let me do that, and that way I have two… I feel so bad!
Rhi: [laughs] She’s been carrying a torch for you all these years and you just come back into her life for one night, lie to her, steal her fruit.
Madge: Four.
Rhi: You are able to disable the alarms. I think you open the door to wherever the little security room is and Carissa is leaning against the wall opposite. She’s changed out of her night gown [chuckles] into something considerably more risqué.
Rhi (as Carissa): I got tired of waiting.
Madge: [laughs] Oh man. Ah man. Oh man. What I’m gonna do… This is the worst. Um… I’m gonna use my silence potion vial. What I’m gonna do is I’ll pull out the vial… it isn’t labeled.
Rhi: No. Why would it be?
Madge: yeah. Why would it be? Then I’ll hold it up.
Madge (as Needle): Wanna have a drink before we head upstairs?
Madge: To show her that it’s okay, I’ll drink it first.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Everything goes silent, okay.
Rhi: Yeah, but you’re already in a silent house, so… yeah. You down most of it and then…
Madge: …offer the rest to her.
Rhi: Yeah. She just kind of shrugs and grins and throws it back. I think for her it’s the sound gets muffled around her. What do you think it tastes like? It’s a golden liquid is how it’s described.
Madge: I feel like it’s just a little bit bitter sweet. It’s the faintest hint of taste.
Rhi: Yeah. She kind of makes a face.
Rhi (as Carissa): Hmm. I might have something better up—Hmm. Huh?
Rhi: And she kind of rubs at her ear.
Rhi (as Carissa): Oof. That’s hitting me kind of hard.
Rhi: At least that’s what she’s saying. I don’t know if you can hear it.
Madge: Yeah. Okay. Okay! I’m gonna put a finger to my lips and then I’m gonna point up the stairs.
Rhi: She nods and gives you a big grin, and then winks at you, and goes to lead the way up the stairs.
Madge: Okay. I’m gonna give 10 paces, and then I’m gonna take on the shadow cloak and leave.
Rhi: Okay. Roll me Prowl, I think, to sneak out of here successfully, but you’re gonna be controlled position, improved effect, because of all of the sneaky help things that you have.
Madge: Do I still have -1 on this one?
Rhi: Not for this, no.
Madge: Woohoo.
Rhi: This is not something that you’re using your hands to do. You’re just walking out sneakily.
Madge: Cool. I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. I think the complication is that you… I don’t know. I’m not sure. You’re able to get out but there’s some kind of consequence.
Madge: [into hands] I leave the vial.
Rhi: Okay! Yeah. I like that.
Madge: And it’s not like either of us could hear it drop to the floor. [laughs]
Rhi: No, no, but you make it out, I think probably just as Minx and Blaire are starting to get into a discussion of “we should go,” “no we shouldn’t.”
Madge (as Needle): All right. Are we heading out or what?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! Let’s go.
Josie (as Minx): Oh! All right. Yes. Let’s go.
Madge (as Needle): Sorry. I had to take care of something in there, because you know, didn’t wanna get followed.
Josie (as Minx): yes. What happened?
Madge (as Needle): Uh… Old flame?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh…
Josie (as Minx): Oh, well that’s fortunate.
Madge (as Needle): You know, you run into them in the weirdest places.
Rhi: You all are able to skedaddle on out.
Josie: Dragging Myra along behind us.
Rhi: She didn’t get a full dose, so Myra is starting to come around, but she’s still pretty out of it. Yeah. You all make it away from the estate, up through Barrowcleft which is pretty quiet. You have to hide from Bluecoat patrols a few times. You make it across into Silkshore and head up to the address that Remira gave you. It’s just a little apartment on one of the canals. You knock at the door, it opens a crack, and you see an eye and then directly below it is the barrel of a gun, of a revolver. The revolver lowers, the door opens, and Remira’s like:
Rhi (as Remira): [sighs] Took you long enough. Who’s—
Rhi: When they see Needle they half-raise the revolver.
Rhi (as Remira): Who’s this?
Madge (as Needle): My name’s Needle. I was the lock pick for this whole thingamajig that went on here.
Rhi (as Remira): All right.
Madge (as Needle): I also made it easier for your people to get back in, so you’re welcome. You can put that gun down.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. Remira has lowered it. They just seem to be a little on edge.
Rhi (as Remira): Sorry. I nearly got mugged on my way over here. I’m a little… [breathes] Anyway.
Rhi: They spot the basket that Minx has.
Rhi (as Remira): Is that it?
Josie (as Minx): No, there’s more, but we have a good picnic here if you want it.
Rhi: Remira takes the basket, flips it open, and just kind of stares for several long seconds.
Minna: Myra leans down and is also staring. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi (as Remira): Could have bought every building in Ink Row for what this is worth…
Madge (as Needle): And it’s all right here for you. Isn’t that something special?
Minna: Why are we giving this to Bazso?
Madge: Because that’s the job. [laughs]
Rhi: Remira closes the basket and flips the little latch.
Rhi (as Remira): So, you said you had a way in?
Madge (as Needle): And a way out. Everything. Just so you know, the alarms are busted, so…
Rhi (as Remira): Oh. Great.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. They won’t give you any problem. it’s gonna be a lot easier to pick the lock. That’s the other thing that’s going on there.
Madge: What else did we do?
Minna: The door.
Rhi: Yeah. You describe where the door is and how to get there and all that. Remira doesn’t write anything down but seems to be listening really intently.
Madge (as Needle): Something else to keep in mind, part of the family that owns the whole place, she’s a bit of a night owl so she’ll be walking around at night. Make sure you keep an ear out for her.
Rhi (as Remira): Right. Okay. Good to know. Nobody… You all made it out without any issues?
Madge (as Needle): Nobody knew we were there.
Rhi (as Remira): All right. Well, I’ll report this back to Mr. Baz, but I think that everything should be square between the two of you now. I’m sure he’ll let you know if that’s not the case.
Madge: At the mention of Mr. Baz, Needle kind of rolls her eyes, like “knew it, knew it.”
Rhi: Remira goes back over to the door and opens it.
Rhi (as Remira): I gotta wait here for a bit before I head back, but uh… Thanks. I’ll keep your offer in mind.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. A pleasure.
Madge (as Needle): Was I not the only one who was getting a job offer?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, different thing, we were gonna help them out if they wanted it.
Madge (as Needle): Ah.
Rhi: So yeah, you set off into Silkshore with some vials of dirt and a mildly tipsy Myra.
## Downtime [0:41:56]
Rhi: Let’s talk about downtime. You did steal those soil samples.
Minna: Can we immediately sell those for profit, or is that more of a project to get it to be a profitable thing?
Rhi: I think that you all have enough connections, particularly now. Needle is probably gonna be able to tell you some people who would be interested in that. Let me actually look back at those pages to find out the specific family who would be willing to buy. The other family that would be most interested is the Brochalla family. You would be able to sell these samples to them… I’m gonna say 6 coin. They are willing to pay out for this.
Minna: Beautiful. One for each of us, 2 for the coffers?
Rhi: Does that work for everybody?
Madge: Yeah, that sounds good.
Rhi: Okay. Let us go into our downtime scenes.
Josie: Maybe as I’m coming back in from my training:
Josie (as Minx): You feeling all better, Myra? I’m sorry for putting you in the line of fire there.
Minna (as Myra): Oh. I probably should have known better.
Josie (as Minx): Don’t put it on yourself like that. It’s my fault. Though, you seemed especially out of it for such a light dose.
Minna (as Myra): Uh… I don’t know if it had more of an effect on me. I’m not sure. What is the trance powder exactly? I’ve never quite asked.
Josie (as Minx): I’m uncertain of its actual composition, but it’s normally used to put one’s self into a stupor.
Minna (as Myra): Ironic.
Josie (as Minx): Heh. But it’s just as effective for poisoning, or in my case, I get a more granular version that can be thrown. I originally purchased this so I could slip it into marks’ drinks and the like, but now it’s kind of become an ace in the hole as it were.
Minna (as Myra): Well, I can tell you as someone who’s experienced it, it does quite knock one for a loop. I’m sorry about however I was acting. I don’t entirely remember everything, but it seems that I was… a hindrance more than anything.
Josie (as Minx): Not overly so. I must admit it was mildly amusing in retrospect. I had never seen you in such wonder before.
Minna (as Myra): I take care not to let anybody see me when I’m in that kind of a state.
Josie (as Minx): Are you in that state frequently?
Minna (as Myra): Oh.
Minna: I think Myra rubs a hand through her hair.
Minna (as Myra): Sometimes it is a comfort to let go, but only in very controlled circumstances where people are not going to be there with me. I don’t like being out of control where other people are there. So, I don’t think it’s necessarily amusing in retrospect to me, but I’m glad that I wasn’t too much of a hindrance.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I apologize, and…
Minna (as Myra): Again, no, you could not have stopped it. Thank you for seeing me safely home.
Josie (as Minx): It’s no issue. We all have our vices. If you ever need, I don’t know, help remaining in control or safe I can help.
Minna (as Myra): I wish I could say that I would be comfortable with that. I trust you more than most people, but I just still don’t know… I guess if nothing else you’ve proved that to some extent you could help with that. I just… You know what? Uh, thank you. That’s what I should have said to that. Thank you.
Josie (as Minx): You’re welcome. Heh. Yeah.
Josie: I think actually it’s gonna kind of end awkwardly there, and Minx is gonna head into her bedroom. [laughs]
Rhi: Blaire? Needle? Do you two want to do a scene together? Do you want to do separate scenes?
Kim: My idea for the downtime scene was that you and I would go armor shopping together.
Madge: Yes! I love that.
Rhi: Needle, where do you take Blaire to get some good armor?
Madge: All right. I’m gonna take her to Brightstone.
Madge (as Needle): If you’re gonna get some armor I think you should go to the place where it’s best. You know?
Kim (as Blaire): Okay? Um… Normally, I don’t know, this part of town is a little bit outside of my coin, but I’ve been saving up. This might be doable.
Madge (as Needle): Oh. I was thinking I’d pay for it.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! No, no, no. You don’t have to do that. You’re just here to help.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah, but if I’m gonna work with you more often I thought it would be, you know, more… uh, that’s kind of weird.
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Madge (as Needle): Just because I did one job, that I was assuming I’d be, you know, working with you more often.
Kim (as Blaire): No! yeah! That’s… You can assume that! I’m sure we could probably, um, we’ll need lock picks again, at least a lock pick who’s better than me.
Madge (as Needle): Heh. We could work on that, if you think you wanna work on that part of your repertoire.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah. Let’s do that.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. Let’s work on that. So, armor first and then we do the working on the lock pick thing.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! That sounds great.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. That’ll be good. Also, sorry, I just wanted to—You seemed a little weird back there when I talked about the old flame. It wasn’t like that at all.
Kim (as Blaire): Like what?
Madge (as Needle): Nothing happened. Well—[seethes] Oof. Okay. Um… [laughs] I said that I ran into an old flame, and you were like “oh…” and I didn’t want it to be like…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah…
Madge (as Needle): We never actually did anything.
Kim (as Blaire): No- No, that’s- I mean, even if you did, that’s okay. I don’t mind.
Madge (as Needle): I just wanted to be upfront with you, you know, just be completely honest.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Yeah. I appreciate that.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah…
Kim (as Blaire): Um… Armor? Heh.
Madge (as Needle): Armor! Armor, armor, armor…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Mm-hmm!
Madge (as Needle): Armor over here!

## Blooper [0:49:04]
Minna: I am not looking at stars, by the way. [laughs]
Rhi: What are you looking at?
Minna: Wait. Are there stars? Oh. There are stars. Sorry, I forgot.
Rhi: Yeah. There are stars. Mm-hmm.
Minna: For a second I was like, “There’s no stars! Right?!” No. They have stars.
Rhi: Yeah. There are stars, they just move around sometimes.
Minna: They just don’t have our big star. We don’t have our big, friendly star.
Kim: It’s fine.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah. We don’t have mama star.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. Thank you for listening, and if you’re celebrating Christmas we hope that it’s a good one, or at least one you can make it through with a minimum of stress.
We have a special holiday treat for our Patreon backers: another bonus episode from the audio we recorded before the series began. It’s a solo adventure with Blaire, so if you’re backing us go check it out. If you’re not backing us on Patreon this is a great time to start. We’re so close to hitting our next goal, less than $10 away. Please consider backing us so that we can do even more awesome things and make the show even better.
We also have another transcript available. Tyler was kind enough to donate a transcript for Season 1, Episode 2. Again, they were incredibly generous to do this for us and next year I hope to have them, along with some others, help us get transcripts for all our episodes. My dream is to have same-day releases of new episodes and transcripts. Another good reason to back us on Patreon.
All three of our Blades in the Dark episodes of Character Creation Cast are posted. Josie, Minna and I had a blast building our characters and talking about the game. Go give it a listen if you haven’t already.
This is our final episode of 2018, and while I say it pretty much every episode, I want to again thank all of you for listening to and supporting the show. The past 10 months or so have exceeded my wildest expectations for what this podcast would be. Creating this show has been an amazing experience, and we have so much more planned for the future. Thank you all for being a part of this as we head into 2019.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity.
Howard Brown Health is a Chicago based organization that focuses on health care for queer people. They do research and education, as well as provide direct health services to the community including primary care, mental health care, and HIV/AIDS care, all available on a sliding scale for low income or uninsured patients. They have several clinics throughout Chicago as well as a youth center and three resale shops whose proceeds support the group’s mission. If you have a few dollars to spare, consider donating either to Howard Brown or to a local queer supporting charity in your area.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:45]
Rhi: We are going to start with Myra…
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: …who is out in the city somewhere on her own for some reason. What are you doing that has taken you out into Duskwall on some errand?
Minna: Ooh. Maybe I was planning to see Jeren or something, because I know I don’t take people to see him.
Rhi: You hear footsteps running towards you from behind.
Minna: Definitely gonna push my back against a wall and get my knives out.
Rhi: You spin into an alley, back against a wall, draw your knives, and look to see a now very startled looking and out of breath young woman who you quickly recognize as Una, one of Phin’s younger sisters.
Minna: Augh!
Josie: Oh no!
Kim: [gasps]
Minna: Oh no…
Rhi: …who has kind of skidded to a stop a couple feet away from you and is just looking from your face to the knives and back.
Minna: Myra slowly lowers the knives.
Minna (as Myra): Una. I’m sorry, I didn’t expect to see you.
Rhi (as Una): It’s okay. I probably should have said something. Um… I’ve been looking around for you. You weren’t at any of the places Phin had said to look for. Can I talk to you for a second?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, of course. Let’s go somewhere a little bit off the street.
Rhi (as Una): Okay.
Minna: I think they duck into a café or something.
Rhi: Yeah. You’ve kind of calmed down from that initial scare, and looking at her you can tell that her being nervous was not just because you pulled knives. She seems very on edge and keeps glancing out the window towards the street.
Rhi (as Una): It’s kind of about Phin. Um… There’s been some Bluecoats, a couple squads of them have been coming around asking questions, asking for money, and they say if we don’t cooperate, you know, they talk about having connections in Ironhook and that wouldn’t it be terrible if something happened in there, and… We’ve tried not to give them too much information, you know, you all are Phin’s friends. It’s not like she really told us much anyway, but we’re kind of running out of money. Stev stood up to them last time they came by and they dragged him into a holding cell for the night, and he was beat half to death when he came back. We just don’t know what to do.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] Okay. I’m not—We’re not gonna let this happen. You might have to give me a little bit to rally the gang and come up with some ideas. Are there good places to meet you?
Rhi (as Una): I mean, you can come by our shop in The Docks.
Minna (as Myra): You’re okay with that?
Rhi (as Una): Yeah, I mean, it’s not like they don’t know.
Minna (as Myra): I’m truly sorry that any of this is happening to you.
Rhi: She just kinda shrugs.
Rhi (as Una): We just don’t want anything to happen to her. You know? Anything else.
Minna (as Myra): I know. Neither do I.
Rhi (as Una): Okay… I should get back home.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. We’ll come by when we can, soon.
Rhi (as Una): Okay. Thanks.
Minna (as Myra): Wait, Una.
Rhi (as Una): Yeah?
Minna: I do have a coin and I’m gonna slip it into Una’s hand.
Rhi (as Una): You don’t—No, no, no. You don’t have to. We’re fine.
Minna (as Myra): It is the least I can do.
Rhi: She’s trying to give you the coin purse back.
Minna (as Myra): This is our fault, and Phin would have been doing it for you if she were out.
Rhi (as Una): It’s a loan. We’ll pay you back.
Minna (as Myra): Sure.
Rhi: She slips the coin purse under her coat and checks the street again before she heads out, darts off and disappears into the crowd. What do you want to do with this information?
Minna: I’m gonna put off seeing Jeren and go back to The nest.
Rhi: All right. What are Minx and Blaire up to?
Kim: I’m up to the usual.
Rhi: Weird, creepy shit in your room?
Kim: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: [giggles]
Josie: I’m fussing over Kevin, because now I’m just sort of into the whole dressing up Kevin thing and moving Kevin around.
Minna: Oh my God!
Kim: She’s embraced it!
Josie: [laughs] Yep. Minx has Kevin in front of a mirror and is switching between two hats on Kevin as though Kevin could have an opinion on them.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, hello Myra. You’re back early.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. I ran into something unexpected and decided not to meet with my friend after all.
Josie (as Minx): What happened?
Minna (as Myra): Phin’s sister caught up to me in the street and it seems like the family is having problems with The Bluecoats.
Josie (as Minx): What manner of issue?
Minna (as Myra): They’ve been receiving threats about what happened to Phin in Ironhook, Bluecoats asking for money, asking for information, they don’t have a lot to give them.
Josie (as Minx): That… Now, that is beyond despicable. They already have her in prison and they seek to use extortion? What… [sigh] Well, we’re gonna do something about this, correct?
Minna (as Myra): I told them we are going to make sure this doesn’t happen to them anymore as best we can. I didn’t put it in quite that strong of language, because I don’t know what we can promise them, but it’s not something that I’m willing to let happen.
Josie (as Minx): Same feelings here, although to be frank a simple show of force might be enough.
Minna (as Myra): I think we’re gonna have to be a little bit more creative than a show of force. It’s a couple squads of Bluecoats against three of us, four if we get Needle in on it.
Josie (as Minx): A couple squads?
Kim: The doors to Blaire’s room open.
Kim (as Blaire): I heard the word creative?!
[giggling]
Minna (as Myra): Yes, perfect. Blaire, come talk to us.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay!
Kim: There’s some weird noises coming from her room, but they stop as soon as she shuts the door.
Minna: We’re just gonna pretend we heard nothing. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: I feel like that’s a key to survival in The Nest with Blaire.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Blaire gets filled in on the situation.
Kim (as Blaire): So, something creative… Do you think they would consider relocating, going into hiding for a little while?
Minna (as Myra): The thing is, they’re running out of money as it is. Their business and livelihood is there on The Docks.
Kim (as Blaire): I know. I knew it was kind of a stretch, I just thought I’d put it out there.
Minna (as Myra): It occurs to me that a better long term solution would be not to put another Magpie in The Bluecoats’ hands but to take one out of them.
Josie (as Minx): You’re proposing a jailbreak?
Kim (as Blaire): Out of Ironhook.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t want Phin to serve her full sentence. We have met somebody with clearly impressive breaking and entering skills. Maybe the timing isn’t perfect, but I don’t think the timing is gonna be great for a while. I’m just saying it’s an option. I don’t know if it’s our best option, but it’s an option.
Kim (as Blaire): It seems like the fastest solution, doesn’t it? Get her out of jail, they’ll leave her family alone.
Minna (as Myra): It is a big gamble, so I just want us to keep that in mind, but I would love to if we can.
Kim (as Blaire): Why don’t we talk to Needle and see what she thinks?
Rhi: Star wipe to…
[giggling]
Madge (as Needle): Well, I certainly think it’s an impressive way of going about it. I particularly would be interested in joining in if you need an extra set of hands.
Josie (as Minx): We do.
Minna (as Myra): You’re interested in joining in?
Madge (as Needle): Extremely interested.
Minna (as Myra): Is it the thrill?
Madge (as Needle): We could say it’s a little bit of the thrill, a little bit of the… Well, a job like this would have a lot of clout as you say. It could be impressive.
Josie (as Minx): Not to mention the personal interest in our crew.
Madge (as Needle): Working with Blaire again would always be fun.
Kim (as Blaire): Um… Well- Okay, yes, I agree, but… Also, we’re doing this to help our friend, so—
Madge (as Needle): Oh, and of course helping your friend out of prison would be awesome.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, um, so… It’s really important that we stay focused for this one.
Madge (as Needle): I can stay focused. Can you stay focused?
Kim (as Blaire): [nervously] Mm-hmm!
[chuckling]
Kim: Blaire nods her head a little too vigorously.
Madge (as Needle): Well, then I am definitely in.
Josie (as Minx): Well then we have the crew, now it’s a matter of the plan, because Ironhook is not as simple as simply acquiring a key.
Madge (as Needle): Well, of course not, but there’s also public records we could look through. Same situation as our last little rendezvous together.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I will say, just in general, if you have been doing crime for long enough in the city, you’ve done at least a little time in Ironhook. Minx and Myra, you’ve probably both been in there at least once or twice, not for terribly long sentences, but like in your youth.
Josie: Except for the one time I sent Bazso instead of me.
Rhi: Right, and the reason he holds such a grudge is because he got put away for like a year. It’s pretty normal in the criminal underground for “oh, where’s so and so?” “Eh, he’s doing a couple months in Ironhook.” “Okay.” And then you just kind of wait for that person to come back. Being gone for a year is significant. People are not gonna wait on you, so Bazso, the reason that he holds that grudge—one of many reasons, but one of the reasons is because he lost a lot.
Minx, Myra, your knowledge… You are both younger, and you both probably got picked up for like a petty theft, so you were not held in any of the high security areas. You both know that Ironhook is not to be trifled with. The security is what you would expect for a prison in this city. It’s terrifying.
Madge (as Needle): Well, we could try to leverage some contacts from elsewhere in the city.
Josie (as Minx): We may need to call in quite a few.
## Blaire & Needle [0:13:29]
Rhi: Who do you want to go see first, your city clerk?
Madge: Yeah, let’s see Petra first.
Rhi: Tell me about Petra. Who is this person? Where do they work? How do you know them?
Madge: [laughs] Petra is the city clerk. I figure she’s pretty mousey looking, standard what you would expect from a clerk or a secretary.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. She’s got glasses.
Madge: Glasses, really thick glasses, hair tied back into a super tight bun. I met her initially through my family and then once I got kicked out I kept her as someone that I talk to, because it’s nice having people to talk to that aren’t directly involved with my family. And… Where would she work?
Rhi: Where would it be useful for her to work? [laughs]
Madge: A city clerk for the city recorder? She would be able to have info on like who did the locks for Ironhook and information on invoices that were used.
Rhi: OH, okay. Yeah! I think that’s basically—[smiling] You two are gonna be going back to the Hall of Records.
Madge: We won’t be breaking in this time.
Kim: Yeah!
Rhi: Yeah, this time you’re gonna be going in normally through the front door.
Kim (as Blaire): This is… kind of weird.
Madge (as Needle): Oh, you get used to it.
Kim (as Blaire): What? Going through—I’m used to going through doors. I’m just talking about, it’s weird, because, last time—
Madge: Because we broke in last time.
Kim (as Blaire): Right. Yeah. Last time we broke in.
Rhi: As you’re walking there you two walk past the wall that you climbed up and there’s fresh spackle over where you two were crawling up the wall with hooked things. [giggling] Give me some kind of roll, and we’ll see what you are able to get out of Petra.
Kim: Do you want to do a group action?
Madge: Yeah, let’s do a group action for this one.
Kim: Okay, 6.
Madge: Four.
Rhi: It will be a 6. You get exceptional details.
Madge: Nice.
Rhi: I think you make your way through the maze-like warren that is the offices deep in the Hall of Records where all of the clerks, lawyers and associates and such work, and you make your way back to Petra’s office. You ease open the door to her office and poke inside. There’s a lot of stuff in her office, but it is all very neatly organized. There’s papers on the desk, but they’re all in very neat piles. The bookshelves are all very nice and neatly organized. She is sitting at her desk. She’s got a book open and is looking back and forth between this book and something that she is filling out. When the door opens she glances up and does a double take.
Rhi (as Petra): [enthusiastic] Oh! Devin!
Madge (as Needle): Hi~
Rhi (as Petra): Hello! It’s been…
Madge (as Needle): It’s been a hot minute.
Rhi (as Petra): How long has it been?
Madge (as Needle): Two years? Probably.
Rhi (as Petra): Oh. How has it been that long? I need to get out of this office more. Come in, come in!
Madge (as Needle): Petra, this is my good friend Blaire. Blaire, this is Petra.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi!
Rhi (as Petra): Oh, hello.
Rhi: She puts her pen into the stand, puts a bookmark in the book and closes it, and then stands up and reaches across the desk to shake your hand.
Kim: I shake it.
Rhi (as Petra): Please, please, sit. Oh, this is such a pleasant surprise. What can I do for you?
Madge (as Needle): I actually have a few questions about Ironhook.
Rhi: Her sort of cheerful demeanor doesn’t entirely disappear but it fades considerably.
Rhi (as Petra): Why do you need to know about Ironhook?
Madge (as Needle): Oh, you know, I like researching things for a lock. Particularly, you know about the locks that they used?
Rhi (as Petra): [hesitantly] Yes…
Madge (as Needle): The folks who were contracted for it? Because my folks are planning on redoing their locks on the estate here in Duskwall.
Rhi: Understanding just blooms on her face and all of the suspicion just vanishes.
Rhi (as Petra): Oh, and your family wants to have the best. Of course.
Madge (as Needle): Absolutely The very best.
Rhi (as Petra): Oh, give me just a moment.
Rhi: She stands up, goes over to the bookshelf, and pulls down a book. What information is helpful for you to have here?
Madge: Locksmith, type of lock.
Rhi: Okay. So… I don’t know enough about locks to talk about it intelligently, so she gives you information about the type of locks… [smiling]
Madge: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: …with a lot of detail, she writes out notes for you on, like, model numbers. The locksmith who did this is Ashlyn Helker, and Needle you probably recognize that name. She is one of the best if not the best locksmiths in the city.
Madge: Okay.
Kim: Do the locks in Ironhook have any unusual protections? Do they throw sparks or anything like that?
Rhi: I don’t think so, at least for a majority of the locks. There are so many people in there moving throughout the space that you don’t want to be poisoning or electrocuting your guards if they use the wrong key on their keyring.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. Any other follow-up questions?
Kim: I might be all set if you are, Madge.
Madge: I’m all set, too.
Rhi: Okay. Once you’re satisfied with the information she walks you out and tells Needle:
Rhi (as Petra): Don’t be a stranger~!
Madge (as Needle): Oh, of course not.
Rhi: She says it was so nice to meet Blaire and then kind of ushers the two of you out.
Madge (as Needle): Thanks. You’re a real treasure. Thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): She was really nice.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah, she’s great. There’s a reason I kept her around.
Rhi: She’s friendly and gullible.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t you feel bad about…
Madge (as Needle): Lying?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know. Do you feel bad?
Madge (as Needle): Used to, don’t anymore.
Kim (as Blaire): Wow.
Madge (as Needle): You kind of get used to it after you lie, a lot.
Kim (as Blaire): I kind of wish that for me.
Madge (as Needle): You just gotta practice. Tell me a lie, right now.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Madge (as Needle): Like, what’s your favorite color?
Kim (as Blaire): [strained] Blue…?
Madge (as Needle): Is that really your favorite color?
Kim (as Blaire): [smiling] No?
Madge: I give her a look.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): It’s not! It’s not!
Madge (as Needle): Okay. What’s really your favorite color then?
Kim (as Blaire): Red.
Madge (as Needle): Good. See? First little lie. You start with the little ones and then you build up to the big ones.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: I think we’ll cut over to Minx.
## Minx [0:20:34]
Josie: I think we’re actually taking a stroll towards a normal hangout spot which is a sort of quirky but not well-kept café somewhere. For some reason I’m kind of imagining Harker as also someone who appreciates the finer things in life, but it a little bit more of a slime ball about it.
Rhi: And is not nearly as good on the escape.
Josie: He’s kind of a Dickensian king of beggars sort of deal.
Rhi: Oh! What’s his name? [snaps]
Josie: Like, the artful dodger or whatever?
Minna: No. Mr. Fagin.
Rhi: Fagin, that’s it. Yeah. Was this somebody, is he old enough that you started off working for him a long time ago potentially?
Josie: Ohh…
Rhi: You don’t have to go that way, I’m just thinking.
Josie: Maybe. I don’t know, that would be interesting, just add to my backstory right now.
Rhi: Yeah, sure.
Josie: [laughs] Spur of the moment. Let’s do it.
Rhi: Yeah. So, he’s probably in his late 40s, early 50s.
Josie: Well, if I worked for him for a little bit that probably meant the three of us worked for him for a little bit.
Rhi: Yes. I think he’s not possessive—It was a very different experience than Myra had with Salia where Salia was like you are mine, Harker was just sort of like, yeah, I’m gonna help you out, and if I’m helping you out you need to do some work for me, but if you wanna go your own way that’s fine. You do your own thing. Free spirit. So yeah, the two of you are strolling along, catching up.
Rhi (as Harker): Oh. That’s so good to hear that Nyryx is doing well. I always liked that girl.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Although, I suspect our interests in her are somewhat different.
Rhi (as Harker): Oh yes, yes.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi (as Harker): So, I suppose now that we’ve gotten pleasantries out of the way I should ask why you bothered seeking me out after all this time.
Josie (as Minx): You don’t believe I can seek someone out merely to catch up?
Rhi: He just shoots you a sideways look and arches an eyebrow.
Josie (as Minx): yes, yes, well, okay down to business then. You are very familiar with the interior of a certain lovely establishment in our town, and I was wondering if there’s any interesting information that might assist a day trip inside.
Rhi: Go ahead and make your roll.
Josie: Yeah! Not good. I got a 3. I got double 3s.
Rhi: Ah, 3, okay. Harker is able to tell you about the entrance and prisoner processing, the low security areas, all of which is stuff that you have experienced. It’s not a ton of new information. he kind of refreshes some stuff that you had forgotten of oh right there’s that guard post between processing and uniforms… He doesn’t really provide you with a ton of new info. He gets picked up for theft on a regular basis and pays his way out on a regular basis, so they don’t bother locking him up in the higher security areas. They’re just like “Oh, hey Harker, you’re back for another stay? All right. We got your usual bunk ready for ya.”
Josie: Put in a revolving door.
Rhi: Yeah, basically. [laughs] He gives you some info but not a ton.
Josie (as Minx): I see, although I suppose it is a very good thing that you do not know the details of certain deeper recesses.
Rhi (as Harker): Yeah. No, I would not want to… I do not bother with anything that would land me in those areas. I have to say, I’m a little concerned that you are.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I myself am not, but I stand by some friends who are sometimes.
Rhi (as Harker): Huh… That’s very noble of you.
Rhi: He pats your shoulder approvingly.
Josie: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Drinks are on me, by the way. Thank you for helping a few months ago.
Rhi (as Harker): Ah, it’s nothing. It’s a formality mostly, but I will accept the drinks!
Rhi: He slings an arm around your shoulder and steers you off towards whatever tavern.
Josie: [laughs] Right. Yeah, so we have a fun evening, but I don’t really get anything.
Rhi: Yeah, catching up. We see Minx and Harker heading into the tavern, and then we’ll swing over to Myra.
## Myra [0:25:25]
Minna: Yes. I’m gonna go talk to Augus the master architect.
Rhi: Okay. Where do we think Augus…
Minna: Oh, he probably has offices in one of the nice areas. Charterhall maybe?
Rhi: Or possibly Brightstone I could see, if they’re a master architect.
Minna: Yeah. Either Charterhall or Brightstone.
Rhi: Let’s say Brightstone, just to mix it up a little. How do you know this person?
Minna: I feel like this is a contact from the Salia days. I think she did a lot of the nerdy research junk. She built up enough of a relationship with him that she was able to talk to him sometimes on her own afterwards.
Rhi: Yeah. You head to his offices, probably have to wait a little bit, he’s probably in a meeting with someone. Eventually the door opens and a pair of women who you’re assuming are probably nobility based on the clothes and the jewelry sweep out, don’t even look at you, and then his secretary steps inside and relays that you’re here. Augus steps out.
Rhi (as Augus): Ah, Myra. I wasn’t expecting to see you here. What can I do for you?
Rhi: He steps to the side and gestures for you to come into the office.
Minna (as Myra): I just had a few questions I wanted to run by you, pick your brain a bit about architecture.
Rhi (as Augus): Hmm. Of course.
Rhi: He sits down at the desk and gestures for you to sit across from him. Go ahead and make your roll here. We’ll see what he is willing to tell you.
Minna: That’s gonna be a Consort.
Rhi: Everybody’s so Consorty today. So much friendship.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: A standard amount of information. you can ask specifically what you’re looking for.
Minna (as Myra): I wanted to pick your brains about buildings built in the old Skovlan style, particularly the fortified ones.
Rhi (as Augus): Hmm.
Rhi: He raises his eyebrows at you.
Rhi (as Augus): There’s not terribly many buildings in that style around here.
Rhi: He kind of regards you for a long few moments.
Rhi (as Augus): [breathy] All right… I’m going to assume that I’m better off not knowing the details of why you’re asking such particular questions.
Rhi: He is able to tell you… There’s not a ton of weak points [laughs] in these sort of buildings.
Minna: It’s on the water…
Rhi: Is it?
Minna: It looks like it’s on the water. What if it has one of those grate thingies for like…
Rhi: It is on water! It is on the river. Yeah, you’re right.
Minna: You know the classic there’s a grate in the water, maybe like a waste thing feeding out into the water.
Rhi: Yeah. You are 100% right. For some reason I thought it was more inland. It is on The Dosk River. Yes. He would tell you that probably the weakest point would be going in through the sewers, the drainage system, but they still anticipate people trying to come in through the sewer so it’s not like it’s just gonna be an open grate you can pop off. It’s still gonna be locked down, it’s just they didn’t spend as much money on the sewer locks as they did on the front door. He answers your questions, and then as you’re wrapping up he stands up to shake your hand across the desk. You shake hands and then he does the thing where he just kind of holds onto your hand and meets your eyes.
Rhi (as Augus): I do expect that you will repay this kindness at some point.
Minna (as Myra): Of course. I never expect anything for free from you.
Rhi (as Augus): Smart girl.
Rhi: He lets you go and walks you to the door.
## The Locksmith [0:29:33]
Rhi: We move out of Brightstone to… Where in the city is the locksmith friend that Needle has?
Madge: Frake is the locksmith that we’re gonna be meeting with who lives in Silkshore. He’s a contact I made after I got kicked out.
Rhi: All right. Tell me about where Frake works. What kind of building?
Madge: The building itself is sort of nondescript. It’s tucked away at the end of a street. You know how they put up lights and lampposts and stuff, it’s like on the corner that’s not very well-lit so that people don’t pay all that much attention when they’re out visiting him. The inside of the building is not an organized mess, it’s just a straight out mess.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay. I think that you go into the shop and there’s just piles of bits of metal and stuff on every flat surface including the floor. You don’t see anyone, but you hear a muffled voice and clanging sounds from somewhere further back.
Madge (as Needle): Frake, are you in there?
Rhi: There’s a thud, and then a:
Rhi (as ???): Ah! Shit! Ow, my head. Yeah, yeah, hang on, hang on.
Madge (as Needle): There he is. … All right!
Rhi: There’s more clattering sounds, and then a Frake emerges from around a corner rubbing the back of his head.
Rhi (as Frake): Sorry. I was working on a big safe I had on the floor and I banged my head on the thing, and…
Madge (as Needle): Oh…
Rhi (as Frake): [winded] Hey, uh, how’s it going?
Madge (as Needle): It’s going real good. I have a little bit of a favor.
Rhi (as Frake): Yeah. I mean, you know, anything for you.
Madge (as Needle): [chuckles] Good.
Rhi (as Frake): Man, that really hurt. Hang on a second.
Rhi: He goes over to the counter and reaches underneath it and comes up with a bottle of something that he just takes a swig straight from.
Rhi (as Frake): You two want something?
Madge (as Needle): Oh. I’m good for right now. Thanks.
Kim (as Blaire): No thank you.
Rhi: He shoots Needle a slightly surprised look.
Rhi (as Frake): All right!
Rhi: He takes another swig and puts the bottle back.
Rhi (as Frake): Okay! I’m good. What can I do for you?
Madge (as Needle): I have a few questions for you. First of all, we’re gonna be talking about Ashlyn Helker.
Rhi (as Frake): Ooh…
Madge (as Needle): Yeah.
Rhi (as Frake): All right. You know how to pick ‘em.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. So, I’ve got my friend Blaire here.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi.
Madge (as Needle): The two of us are gonna be doing some good work over in Ironhook helping those who were wrongfully imprisoned.
Rhi (as Frake): All right. You really do not fuck around with these jobs.
Madge (as Needle): I am ambitious~
Rhi (as Frake): I mean, there is ambitious and then there is…
Madge (as Needle): Death wish?
Rhi (as Frake): …whatever the hell this is. Uh… Okay. Helker. Ironhook.
Madge (as Needle): Mm-hmm. We don’t need exact schematics, but if you know anything about the type of locks they use, any weaknesses in the types of metal, that sort of thing.
Rhi (as Frake): I mean, the whole point of a Helker lock is that it doesn’t have weaknesses.
Madge (as Needle): But…
Rhi (as Frake): They do. There’s no such thing as a perfect lock.
Madge (as Needle): Of course.
Rhi (as Frake): I haven’t really ever gotten my hands on any of her stuff. If… Hmm.
Rhi: He looks at you very thoughtfully.
Rhi (as Frake): If you were to get me some of her models or prototypes…
Madge (as Needle): Bring you back a souvenir?
Rhi (as Frake): I might be able to just make you some keys.
Madge (as Needle): Oh really?
Rhi (as Frake): If I’ve got a lock I can make a key for it.
Kim (as Blaire): How much out of the way would it be to get a prototype?
Rhi (as Frake): Well, Helker keeps them locked up in her safe at her home. That’s where she has her workshop, and she makes the best locks in the city, so you can imagine what security on her place is like.
Madge (as Needle): Oh, it must be bonkers.
Rhi (as Frake): Mm-hmm. I mean, she uses her own locks on everything.
Madge (as Needle): Mm. A bit conceited?
Rhi (as Frake): You’re not gonna get a lot of business as a locksmith if you use somebody else’s locks. Right?
Madge (as Needle): That’s true. Now, tell me, is she sort of a narcissist, someone easily provoked?
Rhi (as Frake): I mean, she’s at the top of her game. She’s confident and wealthy and feels very secure in her house. I will say, if you do manage to get in there and take some stuff, [laughs] oh man, that would kind of ruin her actually. Now that… Wow, you would ruin her…
Madge (as Needle): It would give you a whole lot of business, wouldn’t it?
Rhi (as Frake): It would. I mean, if you bring me prototypes, I was just thinking that if you brought me prototypes of some Helker locks I could make a mint just selling keys and stuff off of those. I hadn’t even thought of…
Madge (as Needle): [softly] Yeah. Heheh.
Rhi (as Frake): Aw, Needle, you gotta do this. You gotta do this for me. Needle…
Rhi: [laughs]
Madge (as Needle): All right. I will get you a Helker lock, okay, if you answer me one more question.
Rhi (as Frake): Yeah.
Madge (as Needle): Would they be able to do business with the Farros family? Do you think that family is on that level?
Rhi: He thinks about it for a second.
Rhi (as Frake): Eh… I mean, if they’ve got the money to pay up for it, probably.
Madge (as Needle): Oh, they’ve definitely got the money to pay up for it.
Rhi: He just kind of shrugs.
Rhi (as Frake): I mean, yeah, she is not as concerned with reputation or family names, she just wants to get paid.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. Money is money. Well, that is very informative. Thank you for helping us out today.
Rhi (as Frake): Oh, thank you, because you could potentially be changing my life here.
Madge (as Needle): Anything for a dear old friend.
Rhi: He just kind of leans his elbow on the table and puts his chin in his hand and is staring dreamily off into space. [laughter Just like, “Aw man, I’m gonna be rich~”
Minna: [smiling] I like him~
Josie: [laughs]
Madge: [smiling] He’s the best. I love him.
Madge (as Needle): All right, come on, Blaire. Let’s leave our friend here to his daydreaming.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi (as Frake): Bye~!
Kim (as Blaire): See ya.
Madge (as Needle): Bye~
Rhi (as Frake): Have… a good theft!
Minna: [cringing] Don’t yell that!
Madge: Heh.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you really think we have the time for this?
Madge (as Needle): Well, your buddy in Ironhook isn’t going anywhere, is she?
Kim (as Blaire): No, I guess not.
Madge (as Needle): I do understand there’s a bit of a time crunch, so… we could potentially get it done tonight.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you really think so?
Madge (as Needle): If we move fast. I’ve got some of my old clothes, we could bring along your friends, you’ve got a fancy-pants type that I could bum along with.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… I mean, Minx could probably pull it off.
Madge (as Needle): So what’s stopping us? Aside from common sense.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but did we have that to begin with? Really.
Madge (as Needle): No.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs]
Madge (as Needle): I always operate as if that’s not even a part of the equation.
Kim (as Blaire): Exactly! Okay, then I guess we’re doing this.
Madge (as Needle): Let’s just run it by your friends first.
Rhi: Yeah. What are you thinking the plan is gonna be?
Josie: Is there a party happening or something? Why is a fancy-pants needed?
Madge: Because one rich person showing up for an appointment would be kind of suspicious.
Josie: That’s true.
Madge: Mainly because Needle herself, as Devin, is kind of disgraced. [laughs]
Josie: Ah. Fair enough.
Madge: She needs another rich-looking person there to add credibility to her.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: You’re thinking that Needle and Minx go in to meet with her, acting like interested clients, and…
Madge: As a distraction, and then Myra and Blaire can actually get the locks. Only if you guys are cool with it, though.
Kim: Yeah. That works for me.
Minna: No, that works.
Rhi: Let’s do the engagement roll. Okay, the one that didn’t fly behind the speaker is a 1, so let’s see what we’ve got back here. Ah, a 4. Okay.
Josie: Hurray. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay, so, you will be starting in a risky position. What’s the entry point for Blaire and Myra? How are you two planning on getting in?
Kim: That’s a good question.
Minna: That is a good question. Did we come as assistants of some kind and got left behind in the waiting room?
Rhi: I’m good with that.
Madge: Yeah, that sounds good.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. You two are like body guards.
## Score [0:38:22]
Rhi: We start with Minx and Needle who are sitting in a very nice study that has a lot of nice wood paneling on the walls, a couple bookshelves with a nice mix of books and small sculptures. You two are sitting on a couch and then there’s a couple armchairs across from you. Sitting in one of the armchairs is Ashlyn Helker who is a Severosi woman in her 60s, so dark skin, she’s got short thick hair that has gone completely silver, and she’s wearing a very stylish and well-tailored suit basically. She’s just sitting there quietly listening to the two of you as you have just wrapped up your pitch.
Josie (as Minx): And not to make this too dry, but in conclusion, as we look at this subparagraph of the proposal I think it will turn out quite profitable for both of us.
Rhi: [laughing] Myra wrote up this massive legalese document.
Josie: [laughs] Uh-huh!
Rhi: She has some paper in her hand, and she’s just like:
Rhi (as Ashlyn): Well, profitable for… [exhales] one of us. I’m really not certain that you understand the value of the locks you’re asking after here.
Madge (as Needle): I think I understand perfectly. I think having your name attached to such an up-and-coming business would not only provide intrigue and profitability to your name but would also make you the envy of all sorts of new up-and-coming shipping magnates, and they would just be pounding at your door.
Rhi (as Ashlyn): They already are. I don’t need your family’s help with my reputation, dear.
Josie (as Minx): Well, understand we don’t come bearing ultimatums. I’m certain we can dig into the numbers a bit.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah. We have fairly deep coffers.
Rhi: All right. At this point, because she basically feels like you two didn’t come here with a serious offer, so you will need to make some kind of social roll to persuade her to keep this conversation going.
Josie: Okay. I think I want to try and hint that we’d be able to offer more things that we’d prefer not to have in the contract.
Rhi: Okay…
Josie (as Minx): A simple contract is not the complete descriptor of a relationship between the family and your business.
Madge (as Needle): Mm-hmm.
Rhi: All right. Go ahead and make a roll.
Josie: What does a Devil’s Bargain here look like?
Rhi: She is a very law and order type. Any implication that you would be offering her things illegally is not going to be met well.
Josie: Ah, that’s risky, but 4d6 has to be a success, right? [laughs] Yeah. I’m gonna take the Devil’s Bargain.
Rhi: All right!
Josie: Okay. I got a 4 and a 5.
Kim: Woo.
Rhi: Five… You do it, but there’s a consequence. I’m trying to think…
Josie: Maybe she needs to step out of the room to deliberate for a moment.
Rhi: Okay. I think I know what it is. She hears your offer and pages through the contract again and frowns a little bit.
Rhi (as Ashlyn): This is a fairly non-standard contract construction. I’m… Hmm. Give me a moment. I need to look up something, elsewhere. Please feel free to help yourselves to drink.
Rhi: She gestures at a side table that has a pitcher of water and a bottle of wine. She’s gonna step out.
Madge: [groans] Okay. Can I grab some of the wine?
Rhi: Yes.
Madge: Dope!
Rhi: We follow Helker out into the front hall where Blaire and Myra… Are you two still there or have you snuck off already?
Kim: I like to think we snuck off. What do you think?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. we follow her out into the hall, she looks around and frowns, and then just strides off somewhere. Where are Blaire and Myra right now?
Minna: I figure that we are sneaking off towards, as near as we can tell, where the safe will be?
Rhi: Yeah. Frake mentioned that it’s in her workshop. You’re not exactly sure where in the mansion her workshop is unless you would like to roll a flashback for somehow obtaining that information or trying to obtain it.
Kim: I’m trying to think. Where would we have obtained it?
Rhi: Blaire, you could do a flashback where you and Needle went up, because you were in the same place where all the blueprints were, so maybe you two just popped up there again if you wanted to do that as a flashback.
Kim: I will take that. How much? Is that 2 stress?
Rhi: One stress. That’s not super outlandish that you would’ve done that. So you two know that her workshop is in the basement, and it’s accessed through a door in one of the halls towards the back of the house. The two of you are creeping in that direction, and you get to the door, and it is very unsurprisingly locked.
Kim: We should try to pick it, right?
Minna: Yeah, might as well.
Kim: Okay. It would be Tinker, right?
Rhi: It would be Tinker. This is risky and you have zero effect. Zero effect means you can’t get through this. [laughs]
Minna: You could push yourself to increase your effect, or take a Devil’s Bargain.
Rhi: You can push yourself to get reduced effect. Basically, you have to push yourself if you want to make any impact on this lock at all.
Kim: I will push myself, but also, Devil’s Bargain?
Rhi: Nope. You can push yourself or you can get a Devil’s Bargain.
Kim: Sorry. I keep forgetting.
Rhi: That’s okay. [laughs] Myra, if she wants, can help you to get you another die.
Minna: Yeah. I’m gonna do that. Ooh, I gotta be careful about my stress on this. Heh.
Rhi: Yeah. Risky position, reduced effect, two dice.
Kim: Got it.
Rhi: You take 2 stress, Myra takes 1.
Kim: Four.
Rhi: Okay… There is a clock to get through this lock, because it is a very difficult lock. You, at reduced effect, are at 1 out of 6. That’s the successful part of this. The consequence is another clock which is Ashlyn Finds You, and that’s gonna be at 1 out of 4. Basically, now we kind of have a race here. You have to get through this lock and you’re gonna have to push yourself every time to get through it.
Minna: Ooh.
Kim: Oh fuck.
Josie: Oof. That’s a lot of stress.
Minna: How much stress would it cost for me to have come prepared with something that could eat through either the lock or the hinges, like an acid or something?
Rhi: Let me take a look at the gear to see…
Madge: Demolition tools… It could also fall under unusual weapon [laughs], or arcane influence.
Minna: I definitely think it’s something I would have got off Seeks. [laughs] Cool, so acid.
Rhi: Yes. You’re gonna need to roll something.
Minna: Can it be Finesse as I do that to try and avoid burning myself with it?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. I was gonna say, I think Finesse is probably the way to go here.
Minna: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Um? Let me think…
Kim: Can I suggest something?
Rhi: Oh, absolutely.
Kim: The acid has some kind of arcane implement. It’s not so much quote unquote “cursed,” but there is a cost to using it. Something like that?
Minna: I like that.
Rhi: It could be as simple as it just smells really bad and it’s gonna give you a headache, so you’re gonna take level 1 harm.
Minna: So I work at less effect?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I’ll take that.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: … Fuck me.
Kim: Oh no.
Minna: That’s a 3.
Rhi: All right. Yeah, so you know how you said you were gonna try really hard not to pour this on yourself? You kinda sorta got some acid on your arm.
Minna: How bad is it?
Rhi: It’s level 2 harm. It burns and it hurts real bad. Yeah.
Minna: The thing is I don’t have the stress to spare, so I’m just gonna have to take the level 2 harm.
Rhi: Okay, and the lock is not open. The lock is still very locked.
Minna (as Myra): [huffs in pain] Ooh. Hell. Oh… Okay, so that didn’t work. Blaire, can you try again?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! Absolutely. Are you okay?
Minna (as Myra): I’ll be fine. We’ll deal with it later.
Kim (as Blaire): Um… Okay. If you’re sure.
Minna (as Myra): Just get to work.
Kim (as Blaire): [nervously] Uh-huh! … Mm.
Rhi: Again, in order to make any impact on this you’re gonna have to push yourself.
Kim: Heheh, 3.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: So, the two of you have been standing at this door for a while. You hear the click of a pistol being readied, and then you hear Ashlyn Helker say:
Rhi (as Ashlyn): Step away from the door, hands in the air, now.
Rhi: So you two are in a desperate position. Back in the study! Ashlyn’s been gone for a bit…
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: You probably can hear her. You hear her talking in the hall.
Madge: Okay. I have the bottle of wine in my hand. I’m gonna head on out into the hall and sneak.
Rhi: Go ahead. It’s gonna be risky for you.
Madge: That’s a 3.
Josie: Oh no. [laughs]
Rhi: You are creeping towards her, the wine bottle I assume kind of ready to strike, and you step on a floorboard and it creaks really loud. She whips around… and fires.
Madge: [gasps]
Josie: Oh no!
Rhi: [laughs] It’s gonna be level 2 harm, and you’re gonna take a shot in the shoulder.
Kim: No!
Madge: Yup. I will take that.
Rhi: You don’t wanna roll to resist?
Madge: Oh. I will resist that.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Six.
Rhi: Okay, so you take no stress, and I think you twist out of the way and instead of it just going straight into your shoulder it grazes along your arm, so now instead of a horrible bullet wound through your shoulder you’ve got like a sexy bicep cut.
Kim: [gasps]
Madge: Nice!
Josie: Nice!
Rhi: [laughs] It still gives you level 1 harm, it still hurts…
Kim: But it looks cool.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. It’s a very cool injury.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: So, she fires at you.
Rhi (as Ashlyn): I knew this was a setup!
Madge (as Needle): This wasn’t any kind of setup. Can I explain first before you shoot my people? I don’t know what they were doing.
Rhi (as Ashlyn): I found your bodyguards pouring acid on the lock to my workshop.
Madge (as Needle): It’s really hard to find good help these days. You know this.
Rhi: I will mention, for Blaire and Myra… The way she’s standing she doesn’t have her back to you. She just has kind of turned sideways. Her attention is currently focused on Needle.
Kim: Hmm…
Rhi: If you wanted to do something.
Kim: You’re putting very bad ideas in my head.
Rhi: Also, Minx, what are you up to?
Josie: I’m kind of thinking, because I kind of knew what I was gonna do, but then Needle started trying to talk her way out of it, so…
Madge: [giggles] I wasn’t planning to talk my way out of it and it just happened. I’m really sorry. [laughs]
Josie: I think I’m just gonna casually… no, not casually, but I’m gonna kind of flusteredly hurry out into the hall.
Josie (as Minx): Dear, what’s going on? What—Why is there a gunshot? What is happening?
Josie: I’m gonna start fussing over Needle a little bit.
Madge (as Needle): Miss Helker tried to shoot me.
Josie: Like, fussing over the wound and just trying to lend credence to this whole ignorance thing.
Rhi: We can say that you are aiding.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Needle, you’re gonna need to make [laughs] a desperate roll.
Madge: Guess what! [laughs]
Rhi: Oh yeah. You have the special ability. It’s gonna be a desperate roll, you’re gonna get a bonus die from Minx helping you sell this, but like… [laughs] This is a tough sell that you had nothing to do with it.
Madge: I’m also pushing myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Six!
Kim: Woo!
[laughter and clapping]
Minna: Oh, this is a hell of a roll. I love this.
Josie: Perfect.
Kim: Excellent.
Rhi: [laughing] Un-fucking-believable.
Josie: Best bluff check.
Rhi: Okay. Okay. I gotta think about how this is gonna… Okay. So, she stares at the two of you for a second and then returns her attention over to Blaire and Myra, and points the gun at the two of you.
Rhi (as Ashlyn): All right. Both of you, into the study. I’m gonna hold you there until The Bluecoats arrive.
Kim: Can I fight her?
Rhi: [smiling] I mean, if you want, yeah.
Kim: I’m not—
Madge: Phin is so proud~ [laughs]
Minna: [smiling] Wouldn’t it have been smarter to fight her while she was focused on the others? [laughs]
Kim: I know! That was in my head, but…
Rhi: Okay, if we wanna roll this back slightly, I will say that the two of you while she is talking to Needle and Minx is distracted there, if you two would like to jump her then you can do it.
Kim: She shot Needle… and she got in the way of our plans.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: So yeah, I kinda want to attack her, as bad of an idea as that is.
Josie: The power of gayness.
Rhi: Do it. Yeah.
Kim: Narratively I know what I want this to look like but mechanically I just don’t have anything.
Rhi: Tell me narratively, and we’ll see what we can work out.
Kim: Okay. I want Blaire to take one of her jars and break it over the side of her head.
Madge: [gasps] Yeah! Wreck!
Kim: [giggles]
Rhi: I would say that’s Skirmish or Wreck.
Kim: Uh… I have 1 in Skirmish, so I guess I have to roll that.
Rhi: Do you still want a Devil’s Bargain?
Kim: Yeah. What does that look like?
Rhi: [exhales, hums]
Kim: Glass shards get everywhere?
Rhi: Oh yeah. Yeah. You cut the shit out of your hand on a broken glass jar.
Kim: Fuck it. Worth it. I accept.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re gonna take level 1 harm.
Kim: Okay. … [groans]
Rhi: What did you get?
Kim: Three.
Josie: The dice hate us today.
Kim: Fuck.
Rhi: You falter. You can either press on by seizing a risky opportunity, or withdraw and try a different approach, so you can basically—
Kim: Risky!
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Go for it.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Should I just roll Skirmish again?
Rhi: Yeah, but the Devil’s Bargain does not continue to apply, so it’s just the one.
Kim: I’ll just roll the one. Oh fuck, 2.
Madge: No! This is bad~
Rhi: Oh my God…
Kim: [groans]
Rhi: I think you’re gonna end up in a desperate position. You lunge at her and kind of stumble. The glass shatters against the wall and cuts your hand. She whips around and you have a gun in your face right now. You’re in a desperate position. So, whoever else wants to do something can do something. Blaire is about to get shot.
Josie: Trance powder to the face!
Rhi: It’s gonna be… Yeah. I think that this is still desperate, because she has a loaded gun pointed at Blaire’s face.
Josie: I’m gonna push myself. I got a 5.
Rhi: You do it, but there’s a consequence: you suffer severe harm, a serious complication occurs, you have reduced effect. Okay.
Kim: I’m so stressed out you guys.
Madge: Me too.
Rhi: She is now trance powdered. You got her, but there is a:
Rhi (as ???): [repeated thudding] Bluecoats, open up! [repeated thudding]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh fuck.
Madge (as Needle): All right. We can roll with this. We can roll with this. Keep working on that door…
Kim (as Blaire): What?!
Madge (as Needle): Keep working on that door.
Kim (as Blaire): [nervously] Okay!
Madge (as Needle): I promise, it’ll be fine.
Madge: I’m gonna toss my fine lock picks to them.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Blaire catches them.
Madge: I’m also gonna hand over a silence potion vial so that they won’t be heard while they’re doing this.
Rhi: All right.
Madge: And then I am gonna head to the door.
Rhi: I think we’re gonna start with Blaire and Myra running back to the door to try and get this lock open. You’re gonna be able to basically get one attempt before Needle gets to the door, so you’ll be able to tick this clock up a little further.
Kim: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like on this?
Rhi: So, at present in the city, there’s a whole hell of a lot of ghosts that know Blaire because of the riot.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Some of them still think on Blaire favorably, the ones that have more of their minds…
Kim: Yay.
Rhi: Some of them just remember Blaire and they’re not quite sure why, so sometime in this score a ghost who remembers Blaire is gonna show up.
Kim: Done.
Rhi: And I think actually right now, because the door isn’t open, and there are no immediate threats. This is actually gonna be controlled.
Kim: Six.
Rhi: Okay. You don’t have the lock open yet, however you just need one more success to do it. But while you’re doing that, Needle and Minx are opening a door!
Madge (as Needle): It is about time that you all got here.
Rhi: What I’m picturing is you open the door and for a second it looks like the Bluecoat on the other side is gonna hit you, because she’s got her fist up to keep pounding on it, and so she stops and is like:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Who the hell are you? What is going on here?!
Madge (as Needle): I am Devin Farros. I was meeting with Helker for business reasons, and our business meeting got set upon by brigands and thieves and I was shot in the arm.
Josie (as Minx): Just dreadful.
Madge (as Needle): And then they threw trance powder at Miss Helker and just left. They jumped out the window, through the study, and now they are off doing God knows what.
Josie: In the meantime I’ve got a handkerchief to my cheeks like I’m crying and I’m resting a hand on her shoulder just looking distraught.
Rhi: This is again going to be desperate.
Madge: Woohoo!
Josie: I think a group action…
Madge: Can we please do it as a group action?
Rhi: Both of you roll however many dice you’re rolling.
Josie: Wow…
Rhi: She got 3, 2, 1.
Madge: Oh no. This is all on me then, isn’t it?
Josie: Push yourself, maybe?
Madge: Yeah, let’s push myself. Four.
Rhi: I think the complication is that they immediately push in to start searching. The Bluecoat in the lead, she steps in forcing the two of you to move back and she starts herding the two of you towards the study. A couple Bluecoats go to collect Helker who I think is just walking in circles in the front hall, and the Bluecoats are fanning out throughout the house. Blaire and Myra, you gotta get one success.
Minna: Do we wanna group action this maybe? Is that something we could do?
Kim: That would be great.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Oh, for fuck’s sake.
Minna: My lower one was 4, so…
Kim: My highest was a 2.
Rhi: So the result is a 4. The good news is you get the door open.
Minna: Yeah!
Madge: Bad news?
Rhi: The bad news… You get the lock open right as a pair of Bluecoats step into the hall and see the two of you.
Kim: Nooo~
Minna: You know what, fuck it. Close the door behind us. We’ll figure it out.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Yep. Yep. Nope, that’s fine.
Rhi: And I mean, you can lock it from the other side. [laughs]
Minna: That’s what I’m saying, I’m gonna lock them out.
Kim: yeah! Let’s lock ourselves in.
Rhi: You can hear shouting from the other side.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): They’re still here! Get this door open!
Kim (as Blaire): We’re so dead! We’re so dead!
Madge (as Needle): Ah! My heart! My heart!
Madge: I’m falling over.
[laughter]
Rhi: So Needle, you’re trying to just be distracting?
Madge: Yeah.
Josie: Uh-huh, and I’ll aid in that I guess.
Rhi: Or do you want to group action it again?
Madge: Let’s group action.
Josie: We just start freaking out, like “oh no they’re still here! Oh God!” [laughs]
Madge: “Oh no! Ah!” Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. This is gonna be risky for the two of you.
Josie: I got a 6.
Madge: And I got a 4, so no stress!
Rhi: Some of the Bluecoats start to go towards the people who were calling them, but they move back towards you, so yeah, only a couple people actually respond to the shouting. Most of them are trying to calm the two of you down. So, Blaire and Myra, you two go rushing down the stairs. There’s a light switch at the bottom and a bunch of electroplasmic lights crackle and pop to life revealing a large machinist’s workshop. There’s bins of metal pieces, tons of metalworking equipment, there are some very large machines that have drills and stuff on them. it’s very high-end. Set into one of the walls is a very large safe.
Josie: Se? You’re safe in here.
[nervous laughter and groaning]
Minna: [laughs] The collective sigh!
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, do you wanna take a shot at this, or…?
Rhi: Did one of you say you brought demolition tools?
Minna: I brought the unusual weapon, but I can have brought demolition tools.
Kim: I have not used any of my load.
Minna: I guess we both saw Seeks, though.
Kim: Yeah. Okay, I’ll mark off demo tools and I’ll use 2 of my load. Yeah, I guess we just have to blow the safe even though that’s not gonna help our cause. Ugh. We’re in the fuck it stage, so…
Rhi: I will say, right now, this is controlled.
Kim: Two 1s.
Minna: Oh my God.
Rhi: On controlled, it is: You falter. Press on by seizing a risky opportunity or withdraw and try a different approach.
Kim: I think at this point we withdraw.
Rhi: Yeah, so you’re gonna try something else. I think you start setting up the charges and then are like “uh, you know, maybe this is a bad idea.”
Kim: All right. I guess we’re picking this.
Rhi: Because you’re withdrawing and trying a different approach it’s still controlled.
Kim: I got a 2.
Rhi: This is just, like, bonkers.
Kim: I’m buying dice right now.
Rhi: You can try it again, but it’ll be risky.
Kim: It’s worth it to try again I think.
Rhi: I mean, you need the locks.
Kim: We do, so that’s why I’m gonna try. Okay, that’s better. I got a 5.
Rhi: Blaire, you’re fighting with this lock, you get it open, you open the door, and you see several neatly stacked boxes that have labels on them and the screaming face of an angry ghost as it lunges for your head. It’s just kind of coming through the wall straight at you.
Josie: Oh dear.
Kim: [calmly] Oh? All right.
Josie: Blaire’s actual reaction. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I forgot about you. Hi.
Rhi: I mean, it’s not talking, it is lunging for you with the intent on eating your soul, so like…
Kim: Can I resist that in any way?
Rhi: Yeah. It will be Resolve, and you have Iron Will to resist ghostly shit.
Kim: Oh, that’s true.
Rhi: It would be level 3, because it’s trying to possess you.
Kim: [laughs] Oh, things got so much worse for me just now suddenly.
Rhi: What’s your highest?
Kim: My highest is a 6.
Rhi: Okay. You take no stress, and possession is kind of an either or, so I think you just managed to like… You’ve had this happen before. You’ve had angry ghost lunging at you, and you just sort of steel your mind against it and the ghost just passes through you without latching on.
Kim (as Blaire): Eh. No biggie.
Rhi: Myra, you’re now trapped in a room with Bluecoats outside the door and an angry ghosts, so you’re probably having a bit of a time. Actually, Myra, you’re gonna need to roll Resolve as well to keep from totally freaking out.
Minna: Ugh, 100% definitely gonna have to. At least I’m rolling four dice.
Rhi: That’s good.
Minna: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, Myra, you’re also just like, “I will deal with this later. We’re just gonna pack all these bad feelings away.”
Minna: Yeah. That’s exactly what she does, clutching her spirit bane charm as she does.
Rhi: You’ve got a safe full of locks that I assume you want to grab. You have a list of the specific ones you need for Ironhook, but you could also just take however many.
Minna: I’d like to make sure that we at least get the ones.
Rhi: Oh yeah, yeah, but you can also grab some others.
Minna: I’ll definitely take some extras while we’re here.
Rhi: Okay. You’ve got the locks. There’s an angry ghost in the room and there’s Bluecoats trying to kick down the door upstairs. What is your plan?
Minna: There’s not any secret ways out that we could find with our underground maps?
Josie: I imagine if there was we would’ve just used them to get in. [laughs]
Rhi: Well, Madge I think it was did mention the ghost key that Blaire has.
Madge: I did. That is something I mentioned.
Rhi: Blaire, you could try to Attune and see if there’s any ghostly ways out of here.
Kim: Okay. Yeah, I can do that.
Rhi: It’s gonna be risky.
Kim: Heh. I got a 3.
Rhi: I think it’s gonna be you lose this opportunity. You attune to the ghost field, but the only thing you see in the ghost field is, again, screaming angry ghost that is kind of circling the two of you, because it can’t possess Blaire and Myra’s got a spirit bane charm that’s keeping it at bay, but it’s just seething. There isn’t a way out down here via the ghost key. The only way out is the way you came in and there’s a number of Bluecoats trying to kick that door down. Minx and Needle, are you two just still trying to be distracting?
Madge: I feel like that’s all we can do right now, because we don’t know that they’ve gotten in.
Josie: yeah. If the door breaks then we might be forced to do something, but until then we’re just gonna hold up the leader and keep asking her questions and freaking out and stuff.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. We briefly cut to the two of you just overdramatically sobbing [laughing] while a Bluecoat has a notepad.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): I just… I just need your names.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi (as Bluecoat): I’m just trying to get my report. I just… It’s gonna be okay. You’re fine.
Rhi: So back to the basement.
Minna: Okay. We’re gonna have to find another way out of here. Egh…
Rhi: Resources available to you: demolition tools, angry ghost, whatever else you might want to have magic into your pockets.
Minna: I don’t have another plan. [laughs]
Rhi: So, suggestion, with the angry ghost.
Minna: I was wondering if we could do something with the angry ghost.
Rhi: You could lure the angry ghost to the top of the stairs where it can get through the door to where the Bluecoats are.
Kim: I like that.
Minna: Cool. Make a deal with a ghost again.
Kim: I can do it.
Minna: Okay. let’s drop back into character maybe?
Kim (as Blaire): I could talk to the ghost. It’s fine.
Minna (as Myra): Do you think the ghost would help us?
Kim (as Blaire): Maybe, if I can calm it down.
Minna (as Myra): It’s worth a try.
Rhi: It’s still gonna be risky.
Kim: Woo, 6.
Rhi: What do you say to the ghost?
Kim: First I actually want to lure it with some ectoplasm. I feel like the offering of food would be the best way to calm it down.
Rhi: Yeah. You do that. It’s been circling you and as soon as you take that out it just stops right in front of you and is staring and vibrating a little.
Kim (as Blaire): Hey. I know you’re probably hungry. Have some of this.
Rhi: Here’s what I’m picturing. It’s a glowing sort of goo, glowing gooey liquid? So I think what happens is it doesn’t actually slurp it up, it just sort of reaches a hand out for it and the glow fades out of the ectoplasm and the ghost glows just a teeny bit brighter.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: You’re just left with inert grayish slime.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay? Better?
Rhi (as Ghost): More.
Kim (as Blaire): More? I can give you more, but I need you to do a favor for me first, if you’re cool with that.
Rhi (as Ghost): [growls]
Rhi: It’s listening, it’s just very angry.
Kim (as Blaire): I need you to take care of those Bluecoats upstairs at the door.
Rhi: It’s gaze flicks towards the stairs and this very upsetting, savage grin spreads across its face.
Kim: Heh.
Rhi (as Ghost): Finally. Food!
Rhi: And it surges up the stairs, and there’s a beat…
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: …and then you just hear a lot of screaming. Upstairs, Minx and Needle, you hear screaming and commotion, and three of the Bluecoats who had gone over to the door come running back screaming.
Rhi (as Bluecoats): Oh God! He’s possessed! He’s possessed! Ahh! There’s ghosts!
Minna: Oh no…
Rhi: They’re totally losing their shit. The other Bluecoats start freaking out and drawing weapons and trying to very quickly load electroplasmic shot.
Madge: Needle is taking this as her cue to go.
Josie: Well, let’s just run screaming. I think they won’t blame us.
Rhi: Yeah. I think in the general chaos the two of you can just flee the house in terror. Blaire and Myra, do you two want to try and head upstairs?
Kim: Yeah, we should get out of here.
Rhi: The two of you are able to run upstairs and the recently possessed Bluecoat has just shot out the back window at the end of this hall and has jumped out and is running. You two can also go out that way. [laughs]
Minna: Myra winces.
Minna (as Myra): Can we… I mean, what are we gonna do about that?
Kim (as Blaire): I… I don’t know.
Minna (as Myra): Better not to think about it right now. Let’s just run.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay! We’re running! That’s the thing we’re doing now.
Rhi: [smiling] All right. You all make it away, barely.
Josie: Phew.
Kim: Good God.
Madge: Oh, by the way, I still have the wine.
Rhi: [cackles]
Kim: What?
Madge: The wine, that I was offered, I have it still.
Kim: Oh my God.
[laughter]
Rhi: You’ve just been clutching a bottle of wine this entire time!
Madge: It’s expensive wine! I’m not giving it up.
Rhi: Fuck, that’s good.
Kim: You’re kidding me.
Minna: How much of Needle’s character is just hoarding fine alcohol?
Madge: More than I would like to admit.
Rhi: God, that’s good. All right. The four of you reconvene at The Hound’s Paw. Everyone is at the end of their rope, pretty beat up, but you got the stuff.
Madge (as Needle): Phew. That was messier than I thought it was going to be.
Minna (as Myra): That’s faster than they usually are.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): But, I mean, we got what we came for.
Madge (as Needle): At least we got that.
Kim (as Blaire): It’ll make Ironhook a little easier.
Josie (as Minx): Just so long as we take a few days to rest we should be fine for the next one.
Minna (as Myra): Oh yes, we should visit Seeks.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): That would be good.
Rhi: Let’s head into downtime.
## Downtime [1:10:54]
Rhi: You all kind of immediately after the score dropped off the locks with Frake, were like these are the ones we need. He was effervescent with joy and showered money upon you and was talking gleefully about how he’s going to destroy Helker.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: A few days later, three or four days after this whole thing, you all show up at his shop again. He is working on some large metal press machine when you all come in.
Rhi (as Frake): Just a second. I’ll be there, just a second… Okay. Done.
Rhi: He comes over.
Rhi (as Frake): Oh! My favorite people, in the whole world. Oh, you’re just the best, you know that? Needle, you have the best taste in friends! I’m not just saying that because we’re friends… it’s part of it.
Madge (as Needle): Oh it’s a lot of it.
Rhi: He goes under his counter and you hear him unlocking a few things and he comes up with a keyring.
Rhi (as Frake): All right. These beautiful, beautiful babies right here will get you through every lock in Ironhook.
Madge (as Needle): Lovely.
Rhi: He kind of holds up one of the keys.
Rhi (as Frake): So, I engraved on the side of them what sort of locks they go with, so this is sort of the exterior stuff, this is the lower security stuff, this is the high security cells…
Rhi: He talks you through it and then he hands the ring of keys over.
Rhi (as Frake): Good luck, have fun, be safe, and I will buy you all drinks when you get out and tell me about it, because this is one of the most profitable and cool things I have ever been a part of.
Josie (as Minx): It’s a date.

"Season 2, Episode 5: The Uncaged Bird Score Transcript","Transcript by Michelle Kelly @michellicopter
Download a Word Doc version of the transcript: The Magpies Season 2 Episode 5 Transcript
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall, and happy new year! As always, thank you so much for joining us. I am thrilled to announce that we have yet another transcript available on our site. Season 1, Episode 3 was generously transcribed by Lyra Song. I am so, so grateful to her for this generous gift. I’m really touched that there are people who are willing to donate their time, energy and skill to creating transcripts for us. That said, I would like to ask that if you want to transcribe an episode, please reach out to me first. I don’t want to discourage anyone, but I also don’t want to end up in a situation where two people are transcribing an episode that I’ve also hired someone to do. If you’re interested, please check with me so I can make sure no one is duplicating work. Again, huge thanks to Lyra and to Tyler for their generosity. I’m hopeful that this year we’ll have transcripts for all our episodes.
For folks in the Chicago area, I will be participating in the Level Eater charity event on January 19th. It’s a really cool event where folks play D&D to raise money for some local charities. To learn more and to buy tickets, visit leveleater.com. There will be a link in the show notes as well.
Today’s episode comes with a big announcement. This is Madge’s last episode. She has a job, and freelances, and just this week, I believe, is going back to school. All of which is awesome. But all of it, especially the school work, is taking up a lot of her time. She had to make some changes and she made the difficult decision to step away from The Magpies. I am so glad that Madge was a part of this show, and the story that we’re telling. I don’t know if we would have ended up on this path, with the crew becoming vigilantes, without the focus and heart that she brought to us with Phin. We’re all really grateful to her for her time on the show and we’re going to miss her and her characters a lot. We’re also really proud of Madge for everything she’s doing, so go give her some love over on Twitter, @madgequips. Madge is a wonderful person and I’m so glad that I get to count her as a friend. With that said, this episode is a pretty emotional one. Most of us were crying by the end of the recording, I cried while editing. It’s a lot of feelings. So, if you normally listen to our show while driving, or on public transit, or at the gym, you might want to hold off until you’re home for this one. Just a heads-up.
Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Josie: Hey folks, it’s Josie. We’re doing something a little different this time. Rather than suggest a single featured charity for you to go through, I’m going to ask that you check out the #TransCrowdFund hashtag on Twitter, Tumblr and other social media sites. It’s hard for everyone right now, but trans people like me especially have a hard time staying afloat economically, due to discrimination and other difficulties. A lot of us don’t really have direct access to the help of charities, and crowd funding via GoFundMe and other sites is what we’ve got to work with. Please consider donating directly to a queer trans person this month. It’s the most direct way to help out and it means a lot to us. Once again, that’s #TransCrowdFund. Thank you.
Rhi: New year and new garbage from the administration. Please continue to call your representatives and pressure them to end this shutdown quickly and without funding for any kind of border wall. With the democrats in control of the house, we’ve gained a small foothold in the fight against the corruption and malice of the GOP, but we have to keep fighting. Visit 5calls.org for scripts and contact info for your representatives.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## Story continues [00:04:01]
Rhi: We start off with a shot of an oar paddling through fairly still black water. And then we, sort of, pan out to see a familiar gondola being paddled down the river Dosk–
All: [excited gasps]
Rhi: ­–as Kay, in near total darkness, is very quietly, very slowly, with the lantern that normally hangs on the front of her gondola doused, making her way down the river towards the looming shape of Ironhook overhead. Sitting behind her in the gondola are the four of you. What is the mood like in the gondola right now? How are people feeling?
Minna: I feel like it’s a tense silence.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Definitely. Minx is, like, checking to make sure her outfit is totally locked down and no fucking sewer water is gonna leak in.
Rhi: Hope she didn’t wear something she’s attached to.
Josie: Nope.
Kim: I know this is right out of the gate, but can I hold Needle’s hand?
Madge: Yes.
Josie: Aww!
Kim: Okay. At a certain point, Blaire’s not going to say anything, but just reach for Needle’s hand and kind of squeeze it. She’s nervous.
Madge: Needle squeezes her hand back, to be reassuring and comforting.
Rhi: So, Kay brings the gondola up along the riverbank and stops the gondola and, kind of, gives each of you a hand out. As she helps Minx out she holds onto Minx’s hand for a second longer and leans in and gives her a kiss on the cheek, and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Good luck in there.
Rhi: And then lets her go.
Josie: Minx is just gonna, kind of, blush and squeeze her hand reassuringly.
Kim: Be gay, do crime.
Josie: Be gay, do crime!
Rhi: So, Kay watches the four of you make your way down along the riverbank for a few moments, before she starts paddling away again. And then we see, like, from inside the sewer tunnel, there’s a large grate and there’s, sort of, the four of you silhouetted against the lights of the city. And there’s, sort of, a clicking of keys, and then the grate swings open and you all step inside to the first step of your break-in into Ironhook. And that first step is dark, and damp, and smells horrible.
Josie: Minx is already wearing a face mask, but is going to put her hand in front of her nose anyway.
Minna: I feel like they’ve just got, like, scarves or something.
Rhi: Tucked bundles of herbs into some scarves, to sort of deal with the smell?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So, you all start making your way through this tunnel. And you get, probably, a good 40 or 50 feet in when you hear, from up ahead, footsteps and muffled voices. It’s a little hard to hear the voices at first because there’s, you know, it’s a little far off and there’s some echoing happening. But eventually, kind of, as the footsteps start to get louder, you hear somebody say:
Rhi (as voice): Yeah, well, Lady Drake said that whatever they are, the bird ones, would be coming in this way. So, we gotta patrol down here.
Kim: [gasp] Fuck!
Josie: Real quick, who’s Lady Drake?
Rhi: Lady Drake I don’t think is a name that has come up. Myra, actually, you would probably know, in character. Lady Drake is a magistrate of the city.
Kim: Excuse me?
Rhi: And probably, just kind of, from talking with Jeran, since his father is a barrister, you would know that she has a reputation for being pretty ruthless. Very smart, very cunning, but ruthless. You do not want to have her hearing your case if you are not properly connected.
Josie: Eesh.
Madge: This is bad.
Josie: And also possibly, maybe, a member of The Circle of Flame?
Rhi: It’s possible.
All: [groan]
Josie: She’s tipped them off?
Madge: Cool, cool, cool cool cool.
Rhi: The situation is, they didn’t get the drop on you; you know there guards are coming, but they are coming. They know that you’re here and it’s possible that a lot more of the guards know that you’re here.
Josie: Is there, like, a corner to hide around or, like, a nook to slide into?
Rhi: I will make a fortune roll. Okay, that’s a 4. There is not so much, it’s not like a deliberate nook or corner. There’s a section of the tunnel that’s, kind of, collapsed a little bit, so there’s, like, a crevice that one person can, kind of, wedge themselves into for cover.
Josie: Mm-hmm. I wanna slip into the nook and ready an unusual weapon, which will be a garrotte wire.
Minna: I crouch down really low in the water.
Kim: I guess I will crouch.
Madge: I’m using my Cloak of Shadows.
Rhi: To blend into the shadows.
Madge: Yeah. Gonna Batman this.
Rhi: Okay. So you’re all trying to hide. Do you wanna do that as a group action, to see how successful you are?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Who is leading?
Josie: I mean, I’m down to lead. I don’t have any stress.
Minna: Okay.
Josie: I got a 6.
Madge: 6.
Minna: I got a 4.
Kim: I got a 1.
Josie: How many failures is that?
Rhi: Only one stress, we had a 4 and two 6s. So, the result is a 6. Which is great for all of you. You all, like, duck down and hide in the shadows and hide in, you know, crevasses in the wall, and they just walk right past you, still chatting. At this point the conversation has turned to complaining about the fact that they got stuck on literal shit duty of having to patrol the sewers. But they just walk right past.
Minna: Let’s just keep going.
Josie: Yeah. Let’s slip by them.
Madge: We’ll deal with them later.
Minna: If we kill someone now, they’re going to notice, and that’s going to put a timer on our actions.
Kim: That’s a good point.
Rhi: So, yeah, you wait there until they have gotten pretty far down the tunnel and then you can continue on. The tunnel kind of goes around a bend and then eventually comes to a heavy iron door. It’s the very, like, classic prison door where it’s an iron door that has a little barred window at the top, and through the barred window you can see stairs leading up. The door is locked. You all have a keyring. So, you open up the door. There’s electroplasmic lights at the top and you can, kind of, see in that light there’s shadows of a couple more people at the top of the stairs.
Madge: I’m sticking to the shadows.
Rhi: Okay. They’re not coming down the stairs, they’re just, kind of, they seem to be just guarding that door up there.
Minna: Let’s try and sneak.
Josie: Yeah. But, I mean, we’ll have to confront them when we get up there. So, I think we just need to take them out quickly. I say we just sneak as close as we can and then jump them.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, I agree.
Rhi: Okay. Sounds like another group Prowl check?
All: Mm-hmm.
Josie: I’ll even lead again, if you want.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. This is still risky.
Josie: I got a 3.
Madge: 5.
Kim: Also a 3.
Minna: 4.
Rhi: Okay, so the result is a 5. Minx is gonna take 2 stress. I think what this is gonna be is it’s reduced effect. So, I think like, yeah, you guys get about halfway up the stairs and then–
Kim: And then we’re seen? Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. One of the guard just kind of, like, it looks like they’re just pacing around up there, sort of bored, and one them just happens to glance down the stairs, double take, and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Oh shit! It’s them!
Rhi: And, like, goes for a gun.
Madge: Yeah. When they notice us, I’m gonna take off the cloak and use one of my throwing knives.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: Oh boy, uh, Finesse for this one?
Rhi: Yeah, you know what, I’ll allow Finesse.
Madge: Woo. So, I have 1 dice.
Rhi: It’s gonna be risky, reduced effect, because these guys are highly trained guards with armour and shit. And they’re, like, way higher Tier than all of you.
Josie: Yeah.
Madge: That’s a 6 though, woo!
Rhi: Okay. What was your goal? What were you aiming for?
Madge: I was aiming to hit one of them in the throat with my throwing knife.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think instead it catches this guy in the shoulder.
Madge: Okay.
Rhi: And he, like, kind of, cries out in pain and falls back a little bit clutching at it, but he is not taken out.
Minna: We need to get these people quiet as fast as possible.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. So, we’ve got one guy who, just like, got a knife in the shoulder who is clutching at it, another guy who has a pistol in his hand.
Josie: I think I want to also use my throwing knives, but try to disarm him with it.
Rhi: Okay, so like, try to hit him in the arm to make him drop it?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. That is gonna be the same thing, risky position, reduced effect.
Josie: Right. And will that be, like, Hunt because it’s ranged or…?
Rhi: Yeah, you could do Hunt.
Josie: I got a 4.
Rhi: 4. Okay. So, yeah, you do it. You throw the knife at him, it sticks into his forearm, he drops the gun because some important muscles have just been cut. So I think the complication is you can hear behind you, coming back up the tunnel, that other set of guards.
Josie: Ah, fuck.
Rhi: They’re not here yet, but they’re gonna be here soon.
Kim: I don’t like that.
Rhi: I’m gonna start a clock.
Josie: Can we, like, jam the door or something?
Rhi: So I’m assuming, like, because you all are competent criminals, when you came up the stairs you closed and locked the door behind you, but presumably they’ve got keys for that door. So, somebody could attempt to jam that door so they can’t get back in. Myra and Blaire still have an opportunity there. You two haven’t acted yet.
Kim: Right.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah, so you’ve got two guards with knives stuck in them, that are hurt but not taken out of the picture.
Kim: Lightning hook works for me, I got that. Yeah, I’m fine with electrocuting one of them, I’ll mark that off my load.
Rhi: Okay. So, this is gonna be risky and since you have a fine lightning hook you will be at standard effect for this. Because it is a high quality weapon.
Kim: Nice. Okay.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Oh my God. I got a 2.
Rhi: So I think what happens is Blaire, you kind of jab up the stairs with this lightning hook and the guy, just like, dodges backwards out of the way. And the other guards are getting ever closer. So, Myra, do you wanna try and do something?
Minna: What if, hear me out, I don’t know that this is a thing, but I know that, like, one of them has recently had a throwing knife and probably stumbled a little bit.
Rhi: Both of them have recently been hit by a throwing knife.
Minna: Yes, but might have like, kind of, shuffled around. Can I roll to see if I can have had, like, a loop of rope laid out for him to step into that I can then, like, whip up around his ankle and tighten and pull his leg out from under him? I don’t know if that’s a thing that I can do.
Rhi: Uh, I think it would be a 1 stress flashback to set up the rope. To say that you whipped that up there during, kind of, the initial melee. And then you’ll have to roll for the trip, but yes.
Minna: Can I do it as, like, a Finesse? Because it’s about misdirection and trickery and shit?
Rhi: Sure.
Minna: That probably is still affected by the -1 Acid Burn. So, what does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: The thing that I keep thinking is that, like, he makes some kind of noise. Like he’s going to shout, or yell, or something.
Minna: If I pull a man down the stairs, he is going to make noise.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Even if he doesn’t yell, just, it’s going to sound like a man falling.
Rhi: Down the stairs.
Kim: Yes.
Minna: How about as I step back I’m going to step on something? Because whether I get him or not, I’m going to take a step backwards. So maybe I step on something that makes noise. So, that ups the clock.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Yeah.
Minna: Like there’s some, like, discarded bit of metal or something that’s going to make a clattering noise.
Rhi: Yeah, that kicks down the stairs and clatters. Okay, yeah. It’ll advance the clock to 3 out of 4 because the guards will hear some noise and start moving faster.
Minna: So I’m going to roll my piffling 1d. 6!
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Holy shit. Okay.
Minna: Okay. So what happens is while the others have been skirmishing, Myra has, kind of like, been watching and, kind of, tossed a rope up around where one of the guard’s feet is, the one that minx just hit in the arm and disarmed. She managed to get a loop of rope behind him and he stumbles right back into her trap, and she quickly whips that loop of rope up, tightens it and pulls. And the man comes crashing down the stairs. But as she steps back, there is clang of metal and she has stepped on a discarded, like, flint for lighting lamps.
Rhi: Yeah. So, that guy is, like, between getting knifed in the arm, bound up with ropes, and then falling down a flight of stairs, he’s out of the picture. The other guard is still up and the other guards are close enough that you all can hear, kind of, running footsteps coming closer.
Josie: Man, I really wanna use this garrotte wire. I wanna get behind the remaining guy and choke him out.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. You can try and do that.
Josie: Umm, what’s that gonna be? Like, Skirmish?
Rhi: Yeah, probably.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Nice. So, you are able to, as this other guy kind of goes thudding down the stairs, you are able to jump up, kinda get behind this guy with the knife and choke him. I assume into unconsciousness, not death.
Josie: Correct.
Rhi: Okay. So, these two guards are unconscious.
Josie: I suggest we jam the door and move on. Like, someone who can tinker.
Rhi: Yeah, probably that sounds like a Needle job, to jam the door so that they can’t get through.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah, I could easily get this taken care of.
Rhi: So, it’s gonna still be risky and you have fine lock picks, right? Okay. It is gonna be standard effect because you’ve got the higher quality tools. So, that helps.
Madge: 5.
Rhi: Needle, you crouch by the door and you’re, like, working really, you know, as fast as you can, even with your stiff hand, to get the lock jammed up so that they won’t be able to use their key to get through. You can hear the guards, like, running and shouting, kind of, calling ahead to their fellows and not getting an answer. And, just as the guard gets to the door and goes to unlock it, you, like, feel something kind of pop in the lock and you step back. And he, like, rattles at the door. And he can see through the little bars in the window and you make eye contact for a second. And he goes:
Rhi (as Guard): Dammit, they’re here. We have to raise the alarm.
Rhi: And then they go running back off, down the tunnel. So, at some point, it’s gonna take them a bit, but at some point, they are going to make it back up and out to someone that they can inform.
Madge: And an alarm is gonna go off, okay.
Rhi: So, I’m gonna say, do I think this is a 6 or an 8? It’s gonna be an 8-tick clock. So, you’ve got a little bit of a longer fuse on that one. But, I’m gonna call that Alarm Raised. 1 out of 8.
Madge: Okay.
Rhi: They’ve taken off. This door is jammed, nobody is gonna be able to come up behind you this way, at least. You’ve got keys to the next door up. This is basically gonna take you to like, kind of, the garbage room, furnace room. Like, this is where stuff that is being disposed of is taken and broken down, you know, thrown into furnaces–
Kim: We’re in the trash compactor!
Minna: Why do we keep ending up in this room? [giggles]
Rhi: Because you keep entering through basements and sewers. This is only the second time I think you’ve ended up in a space like this.
Minna: [laughing] The second time!
Kim: Still.
Minna: I love it. I’m into it. We’re just trash monsters. Thank you for putting us in the garbage where we belong.
Rhi: So, you are here in this room. It’s a fairly large room. There’s just, like, piles of crap everywhere. And it seems like stuff is, sort of, being sorted by type. So there’s like, a couple mounds of fabric, there’s some scraps of metal, there’s just all sorts of random stuff. Right now, there’s nobody in the room. You all can see, as you start to move forward, there are, like, metal loops on the floor that Minx and Myra, you know from previous times you’ve been in Ironhook, prisoners get assigned to sort stuff in here and they basically all have ankle chains that run through these loops in the floor, so they’re very limited in their movement. And there is another door. It’s a set of double doors across the room. So, is there anything, like, do you guys wanna look for anything in here, or just, kind of, press on?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, I think time is of the essence, dears.
Madge (as Needle): Could I just try something really quick here?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah?
Madge: I’m gonna try and jam up some of the ankle stuff, so that next time people are in here, the chain gang stuff won’t work proper.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Oh, okay.
Rhi: Future chaos.
Madge: Yep. Okay, so that’s gonna be a Tinker.
Rhi: It’ll be controlled, because there’s not an immediate threat.
Madge: Mm-hmm. 4.
Rhi: You hesitate. Withdraw and try a different approach, or do it and face a minor consequence, which will probably be that it becomes risky.
Madge: I’ll just leave it. It’s not worth it.
Rhi: So, the double doors on the other side of the room again have, kind of, the barred windows in them. And peering out you can see that this leads into a hallway where you can go left, right, or straight. And Minx and Myra, you have done some time in Ironhook, back in your misspent youths. So, this area you two actually have been in. This is, kind of, the lower security, general population area of the prison. This is where it’s the, you know, petty thieves, vandals, people who get picked up on fairly minor charges who are only being held for, like, at most a couple months.
Minna: Do we know, like, where the high security area would be? Just from like, general scuttlebutt?
Rhi: Yes. So, the first two floors are general population, and then the higher floors are high security. So, you two are familiar with, like, the first two floors, and you kinda know roughly where the access points to the higher levels are. But once you get up to those higher levels you are basically, kind of, in an entirely new environment. Where you are right now, though, you know that left and right will take you basically into a big, sort of, circle around the floor that has cells on it. And straight ahead is gonna take you into, kind of, the-, there’s not really a prison yard, like, an open outdoor space in Ironhook–
Minna: Like the common area?
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a big common area, it’s where meals are served, you know, prisoners are allowed to spend time there during their allotted hours out of their cells. This late at night, that area is going to be empty of prisoners. There will probably be guards on patrol. And, let’s see, where would the access points be? There is basically, there’s stairwells in each of the corners of the-, it’s basically just a big square. Ironhook is very blocky. And in each corner of the floors is where the stairs are, leading up to the higher levels.
Josie: Let’s go left.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: You’re always supposed to turn left.
Rhi: How do you want to make your way down this hall?
Kim: Should we run or no?
Madge: I think soft steps. My shadow cloak is coming back out for this one.
Minna: I think we just brazen our way through, like, walk of confidence, like we’re supposed to be here. [laughs]
Madge: [laughs] Oh my God.
Josie: Yeah, let’s do it. The casual walk.
Rhi: You all can give that a shot.
Josie: Uh-huh. I’m gonna do my Sway.
Kim: Would that be a Sway? I guess, right?
Rhi: Trying to convince a bunch of people that you’re supposed to be here, yeah, I think so.
Kim: Alright.
Rhi: Are you doing this as a group action?
Minna: I had assumed we were, because usually when we’re moving through an area as a group.
Josie: Triple 6s.
Kim: Jesus Christ.
Minna: Oh, that’s a crit.
Kim: I rolled a 1.
Minna: I rolled a 5.
Madge: I also got a 1.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Alright, 2 more stress.
Rhi: Yeah, but the result is a critical success.
Minna: This is the trailer shot of us walking like badasses.
Rhi: Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
[laughter]
Rhi: It’s the wide shot of, like, the four of you come out of the door and, you know, you’re walking, in reality, quickly, but the shot is in slow-mo, and at first it’s the wide shot of all four of you striding together, and then we’re gonna, like, zoom in on each person. Like, what cool thing are you doing?
[excited squeals]
Kim: Yes! I love this!
Josie: Uh-huh.
Madge: Yes.
Rhi: So let’s start with, we start on Needle. What cool, like, pose or gesture or whatever is Needle doing?
Madge: I’m winking at a prisoner.
Rhi: There’s some guy, like, just leaning against the bars, and kinda like, looks at the four of you. And Needle just gives him a wink and he, like, he does the thing where he looks over the shoulder and then points at himself, like, ‘Me?’
[laughter]
Madge: Oh my gosh, yeah, that’s exactly how it goes.
Rhi: Oh my God, yes. Myra, what are you doing?
Minna: Oh God, how do I make Myra cool? I know she’s cool, just, what cool thing?
Kim: She can like, you know, if she’s wearing a jacket or something, she can pop a collar or something?
[laughter]
Minna: She definitely does that just to conceal her face, but it ends up looking really cool.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Kim: Yes!
Rhi: Okay, Minx, what are you doing?
Josie: Minx is fucking strutting her stuff. Like, runway walk.
Minna: Does she, like, toss her hair?
Josie: Yeah, well, I was about to say her hair is, like, tied up in a bun right now because stealth, but she loosens it a little bit and one little flop of hair, kind of, gently drapes across her eyebrow in that sexy fashion.
[delighted gasps]
Kim: This is the best.
Minna: I love that the crit is just that we all look really cool.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. And Blaire, what cool thing are you doing?
Kim: So Blaire has one of her fine lightning hooks in both hands, and she’s twirling both of them and then hooks them to her belt.
Madge: [gasp]
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Nice. Alright. So, yeah, and then it gets to, like, the camera swings around behind the four of you as you get the near the door and like, a prisoner in the last cell next to the door just is like:
Rhi (as Prisoner): Who are you?
Josie: Can we just casually flip him a Magpie pin?
Rhi: Please do.
Multiple: Yes!
Josie: Just, flick.
Rhi: Yeah, and he catches it. And the shot is, like, him holding the Magpie pin, looking at it, and then you hear the door clang shut. So, the critical is gonna get you, you are able to make it not just down this hall and into the stairs, you make it up to the third floor without running into a single person. There’s no guards, like, you just have incredibly good luck on timing, and you don’t run into any guards on the stairs, or anything. So, you get up to the third floor no problem.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: What do you want to do? This is the part of the prison where you don’t really know what you’re going to be encountering.
Madge: I know that we’re in a position where it is, like, higher security, but are there people in cells that we can still talk to?
Rhi: I’m gonna say yes, there are.
Madge: Alright, then I’m gonna sneak up to a cell and keep my voice down.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, go ahead and make a roll for that sneaking.
Madge: So, that is gonna be a 4.
Rhi: I think the consequence is gonna be I’m gonna advance the clock. You know, prison-wide alarm being raised. Needle, you creep over to a cell where you can, kinda like, see somebody moving around. On the lower levels, the prisoners are kept, you know, they’re like, bunked up four or six to a room. Here, they’re kept in individual cells because the odds that some of them might kill each other are pretty high.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: So, yeah, you creep over to a cell and there is a woman just, kind of, pacing back and forth across the very small part of the cell.
Madge (as Needle): Oi! Hi.
Rhi: She whips around and, like, has a shiv in her hand.
Madge (as Needle): Hey, hey, hey. Do I look like a guard?
Rhi (as Prisoner): No. But that doesn’t mean I might not need to stab you.
Madge (as Needle): You won’t need to stab me.
Rhi (as Prisoner): Okay.
Madge (as Needle): I’m looking for a girl.
Rhi (as Prisoner): I mean, I’m–
Madge (as Needle): I mean besides you. She’s… hey, what does she look like? The one we’re here to get?
Kim (as Blaire): She’s short and usually angry.
Madge (as Needle): Alright. We’re looking for a short, angry girl?
Minna (as Myra): Short, dark hair.
Josie (as Minx): She has likely made quite a scene.
Kim (as Blaire): She has a tattoo on her hand.
Rhi (as Prisoner): Oh, yeah. Phin. Yeah, real piece of work, that one. What, you all here to bust her out or something?
Josie (as Minx): Precisely.
Rhi (as Prisoner): Hmm. Well, I might know where she is, but–
Madge (as Needle): It’s gonna cost us?
Rhi (as Prisoner): I’m not gonna tell you for free.
Madge (as Needle): Of course. Of course.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I mean, I don’t think we have any problem with letting anyone else out.
Rhi: And she gets this big, like, slasher smile grin, and is like:
Rhi (as Prisoner): Ah, now that’s exactly what I was hoping you’d say.
Kim (as Blaire): What, wait, wait– what did you get put in for?
Rhi (as Prisoner): Ah, don’t worry about it. You open this up, and I will tell you where to find your friend.
Kim (as Blaire): Er… team meeting? Team meeting?
Madge (as Needle): One second. I have a secondary condition.
Rhi (as Prisoner): Yeah?
Madge (as Needle): So, if we let you out, you can’t stab anyone until we’re gone.
Rhi (as Prisoner): How am I supposed to know when you’re gone?
Madge (as Needle): So, once we pass by you with the piece of work.
Kim: Can we all do, like, a huddle?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I don’t especially relish the notion, but she may handle some of the guards for us.
Minna (as Myra): It might be our only choice. She might alert the guards if we don’t let her out.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, we have already spoken to her.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s true. Are we cool with, like, letting out someone potentially dangerous, though? Like, how do we know that she won’t, you know, stab us?
Madge (as Needle): She might have gotten stabby after she got put in here.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think we’re making the pool of people in Duskwall substantially worse.
Josie (as Minx): Besides, there’s four of us and one of her.
Kim (as Blaire): True.
Minna (as Myra): If she makes a mess, then she’s in as much trouble as we are.
Josie (as Minx): Then it sounds like we are letting her out.
Madge (as Needle): Also, we could always just stab her later.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I mean there’s nothing preventing mutual stabbing.
Kim (as Blaire): Only if she stabs first.
Madge (as Needle): Yeah, mutually assured stabbing.
Kim (as Blaire): That sounds okay with me, but we gotta keep an eye on her.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. I think that we need her to lead us to Phin’s cell.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Alright. So you guys are gonna let her out?
Kim: Wait, wait.
Kim (as Blaire): Everybody, hands in, hands in.
Minna: [laughs] Myra puts her hand in.
Josie: Places hand.
Madge (as Needle): Are we counting down? What’s going on?
Kim (as Blaire): We’re breaking the huddle, we’ve gotta ‘1, 2, 3’.
Madge (as Needle): Break?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Madge (as Needle): Alright. Before I let you out, can I get your name, please?
Rhi (as Prisoner): Folks call me Frost.
Madge (as Needle): Frost. Okay. Well, Frost, my name is Needle, nice to meet you, and here’s what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna let you out of here, you’re going to take us to Phin, and then we’ll let you on your merry way.
Rhi (as Frost): So all I gotta do is walk you there?
Madge (as Needle): That’s all you gotta do.
Rhi (as Frost): Alright.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, stay frosty.
Madge (as Needle): [laughs]
Rhi (as Frost): I will stab you.
Josie: Oh dear.
Minna and Josie: [laughter]
Madge (as Needle): If you stab her, I stab you.
Rhi (as Frost): I mean, fair, and I understand that, but that’s the one joke that you get.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, I’ll shut up now.
Madge (as Needle): Okay.
Madge: And then I’ll spin the key on my finger and unlock the door.
Rhi: When you all look back, the mattress on the bed is sliced open and–
Kim: [shudders] This is a good person we picked up.
Rhi: She has acquired a couple more shivs and a couple vials of something that she has tucked under her belt.
Kim: Great!
Josie: Hmm.
Kim: I don’t like this.
Madge (as Needle): Hands where we can see them.
Rhi: She comes out and, like, stretches her arms out, and is like:
Rhi (as Frost): Ah yeah, so close. Alright. Yeah. Phin. This way.
Rhi: And I think that we’re gonna need another roll for sneaking.
Minna: I can lead this time if you want? Unless somebody doesn’t have any stress, because I have, like, 4 stress.
Kim: I have one stress, I don’t mind leading.
Josie: Okay, let’s have Blaire lead then.
Madge: 5.
Minna: 3.
Josie: 1.
Kim: 2.
Rhi: Okay. So the result is a 5. I’m gonna advance that clock again. Frost starts to lead you down the hall and then you all, kind of, have to, like, duck into the shadows and hide and wait for a little bit as a guard patrol goes past. So, that eats up some time. But yeah, she leads you, kind of, down this corridor, around a corner, and then halfway down another corridor to a cell, kind of in the middle of everything, and sleeping on the bunk is Phin.
All: Yay!
Madge: It’s me!
Rhi: It is! Madge, how is Phin looking? She’s been in prison for, probably, a little over two months, two and half months, at this point. How’s she looking?
Madge: So, she’s definitely looking rough, because we’ve established that she has been put through the ringer. She’s got dark circles under her eyes which are equal parts black eyes and also not sleeping well. Her hair is all messed up.
Rhi: And it’s a lot longer too, because she wouldn’t have been able to get a haircut for all that time.
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, Frost basically walks you to the cell, points, is like:
Rhi (as Frost): That’s her.
Rhi: And then turns and starts walking away. Unless somebody’s gonna stop her.
Madge: Nope.
Kim: Bye.
Madge (as Needle): Make good choices!
Rhi: [laughs] I think, yeah, she just kind of gives a brief wave over her shoulder and heads off. Gonna just make a note that she’s out there.
Madge: [laughs] This is fun.
Rhi: Wandering… around… with… knives. Okay, this has been noted.
Kim: Ugh, great.
Minna: Ugh.
Kim: Myra, I think you should be the one to try and wake her up.
Minna: Yeah. Myra steps up to the bars.
Minna (as Myra): Psst!
Minna: Do they have any, kind of like, codeword, for like, ‘Hey it’s an emergency, you need to be quiet and work with me’?
Rhi: I don’t know, do you?
Madge: Hey, it’s an emergency, you need to be quiet and work with me.
[laughter]
Minna: Okay, so they don’t do codewords. Cool. She’s just gonna say:
Minna (as Myra): Phin?
Madge (as Phin): Hmph.
Minna (as Myra): Phin, you need to wake up.
Madge (as Phin): [mumbles]
Minna (as Myra): Phin.
Madge (as Phin): What? [mumbles]
Minna (as Myra): Phin?
Madge (as Phin): Myra?
Minna (as Myra): It’s us. It’s Myra, and Minx and Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ve come to get you out.
Madge: Oh my gosh. Okay, Phin’s gonna get up and head to the bars and peek out here.
Josie (as Minx): Hello, dear.
Madge (as Needle): Hey.
Madge (as Phin): Wait–
Minna (as Myra): Hi.
Madge (as Phin): Hi?
Minna (as Myra): We’re here to get you out.
Madge (as Phin): What are you…?
Josie (as Minx): Well, I mean, we presume you do not want to stay in prison?
Minna (as Myra): We weren’t ever planning on letting you stay here, but it’s also dangerous for your family if you stay here. So, come with us.
Madge (as Phin): Can you go back to the part with my family?
Minna (as Myra): Don’t worry about it.
Kim (as Blaire): They’re okay.
Minna (as Myra): Once you’re out, it’s fine.
Madge (as Phin): Huh? No, that’s not how it works.
Minna (as Myra): You’re blackmail leverage right now. So, hey, come out, let us figure– help us figure this out and help your family.
Madge (as Phin): Okay, can you open the door?
Minna (as Myra): That’s the plan.
Madge (as Phin): Because I can’t do that on my own.
Kim (as Blaire): We have keys.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re able to unlock the door, no problem. And Phin is able to step out.
Josie: Group hug, group hug.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah. Who starts it?
Kim: Me.
[laughter]
Josie: Aww!
Rhi: Phin clears the door and Blaire just goes in for the hug.
Kim: Oh yeah, I just fling myself at Phin.
Madge (as Phin): Hey, kid.
Rhi: Yeah, so everybody gets in for a big hug. I think Needle is probably kind of like, ‘This is lovely, I’m gonna keep watch’. Alright. So, yeah. You got Phin out.
Kim and Josie: Yay!
Minna: Now let’s leave!
Josie: And now we should run.
Madge: Yes.
Minna (as Myra): Alright, time to get out of here.
Rhi: Is that the plan, to just haul ass, or are you going to try to sneak back out?
Kim: Uhh, both?
Josie: Yeah, I mean, the alarm’s going to get raised eventually anyway, so.
Minna: As quiet as we can be while also being fast.
Kim: For as long as possible. It may reach a point where we can’t be stealthy about it, but let’s just stick to it for as long as possible.
Rhi: Okay. The time that your reunion took, ticking up the clock again.
Kim: Hugs should not cost anything.
Josie and Madge: [laughter]
Rhi: This is blades in the dark, I’m sorry.
Kim: Ugh. [fake sobbing]
Rhi: Alright, yeah. So, we’re gonna need some kid of roll for sneaking back to the door on the third floor.
Josie: A group prowl?
Kim: Group prowl.
Josie: Who’s gonna lead it?
Madge: I’ll lead it. With Phin, sorry.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I got a 5.
Minna: 4.
Kim: 2.
Madge: 3 for Phin, 6 for Needle.
Rhi: Okay. So, result is going to be a 6 and I think that was 2 points of stress. Yeah, you all successfully make it back to the door and you’re able to start making your way down. You get to the second floor and an alarm starts sounding from upstairs.
Josie: Now can we do the running?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Because I made a fortune roll to see how Frost did on her murder and acquire keys. It didn’t go well for her.
Josie: Bolt.
Rhi: Alright. So you’re gonna run for it?
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay. You run down the stairs to the ground floor, open up the door, and there’s a group of guards running in your direction. You all basically see each other at the same time, they don’t really have the drop on you.
Madge and Minna: Okay.
Rhi: So, yeah, it’s just kind of like, you all burst out of the stairs, they come around a corner, and it’s like, ‘Uhh…’
Madge (as Phin): Someone give me a knife.
Minna (as Myra): Myra hands her a knife.
Madge (as Phin): Thank you.
Josie: I’m gonna pull out a gun.
Kim: I’m gonna take out my lightning hooks.
Rhi: Okay. People, do what you’re gonna do.
Josie: I’m gonna do a gun.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: And shoot a thing.
Rhi: Alright, it’s gonna be risky, reduced effect.
Josie: You know, I think I actually wanna push myself for higher effect on this one.
Rhi: Okay. Take 2 stress.
Josie: I wanna put them on the back foot with this. I got a 3, so I failed.
Madge: In the meantime, can I do a punch and slash?
Rhi: Yeah, Phin can just charge into somebody.
Madge: Can I do that as a wreck, since I am looking to cause as much damage as possible?
Rhi: Oh, yeah. I imagine Phin has a great amount of aggression towards the guards she needs to work out.
Madge: Yep. 5.
Rhi: Okay, so Minx, your shot goes wild, and these are like, single-shot flintlock pistols, so you shoot and then you’re, like, really quickly trying to reload while the guy you shot at is running at you. And then, kind of like, passing each other, Phin goes charging forward towards another one of the guards. And you, Phin, are able to tackle and stab and I imagine are just, kind of like, grappling on the floor.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: And I’m gonna move the clock up again, because this is kinda, you know, drawing attention. Minx, the guard that is charging at you–
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: –is gonna knock the gun out of your hands and then bash you across the head with a truncheon for level 2 harm.
Josie: Ouch. Okay. Can I use up load slots to have armour?
Rhi: Yeah. It’s 2 spots of load to, kind of, soak that, and I’ll drop it down to level 1 harm.
Josie: Right. I wanna, like, throw up the armoured bracers I have on under my sleeves to reduce the impact.
Rhi: Yeah, so like, your arm is bruised all to hell, but at least it doesn’t hit your head. Blaire, Myra and Needle can also act. What are you all doing?
Kim: I think I would like to go for the guard that Phin already has engaged, and try to electrocute them.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Just while he’s distracted. Because I don’t think I could charge head-on to an unengaged enemy, being the five foot one squishy wimp that I am.
Rhi: [giggles] Yeah. So, that’s gonna be risky position, still. Standard effect.
Kim: Okay and, what would I roll for my lightning hooks? Skirmish, do you think?
Rhi: Yeah, probably.
Kim: Okay. And what do you think a Devil’s Bargain on this looks like?
Rhi: The electroplasm charge that your lightning hooks have is almost out. You’ll be able to use them for this one attack and then they’re gonna be burned out for the rest of the fight. The rest of the score, basically.
Kim: I accept. I’ll take that.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Woohoo! My friends, that is double 6s. That’s a critical success.
Rhi: Shit.
Josie: Ooh.
Kim: Finally. Finally, the heavens open up and I rolled good once.
Josie: I feel like the dice are being nice to us after last week.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, I think the reason that you burn out all of the rest of your power source is you just, like, super-charge the lightning hook–
Kim: Like, both of them, pretty much.
Rhi: Yeah, and then just, like, slam them into this guys back, and he seizes up and falls to the ground.
Kim: Yeah. I’d like to imagine that the guy falls between the space between Phin and Blaire, and they meet eyes and Blaire just kinda shrugs.
Rhi: Alright. Myra and Needle can still do some stuff. We’ve got three guards that are still up, two have not been hit at all and have pistols out.
Madge: Needle is gonna take a ring knife and is gonna jump in.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: To do a stab. Which will be a Skirmish.
Minna: So, I did a shoot and I failed.
Rhi: Okay, what did you get?
Minna: 3.
Rhi: Okay. Needle, what did you get?
Madge: Um, 3.
Rhi: Okay. Needle, I think you just kind of end up, like, sparring with this guard a little bit. Like, she takes a swing at you with the truncheon, you dodge back, you punch in with the knife and she twists out of the way. And you’re both just kind of, like, dodging each other’s blows. Myra, you took a shot.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: And missed.
Minna: Yes. Room gets shot again.
Rhi: No, no. I’m gonna do something more fun. Your shot goes wild and hits this box on the wall that starts ringing real loud. You just set off an alarm down here. So, you all can now hear shouting from both the hallway ahead of you and the stairs behind, and footsteps running from both directions.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: Yep. And you still have three guards that are up and fighting.
Madge: Phin’s gonna stab again.
Rhi: Alright.
Madge: Yeah, I got a crit.
Rhi: Nice.
Josie: Ooh.
Rhi: Tell me how Phin straight up murders a dude.
Madge: [laughs] I feel like she gets up, looks at the one that Myra was gonna shoot and narrows her eyes, and then jumps him, knocks him out of frame… [laughs]
Rhi: And there’s just screaming sounds?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. Alright, so that’s two guards down. Man, nice. And I think for the critical, the viciousness of Phin’s attack distracts the other two guards momentarily, so anybody who’s attacking the other two guards will be at standard effect for their next, kind of, actions, because they are momentarily distracted by a grisly murder.
Josie (as Minx): Phin, dear? It’s nice to have you back.
Josie: I think I want to get my pistol back. I’ll use the hesitation to run and grab it.
Rhi: I’ll say that you can just do that, but then that’s, kind of, using up that advantage that you had. You’re able to scramble away from them and get your pistol, but when you attack it’s going to be back at reduced effect.
Josie: Yeah. Fair enough.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, Minx, you’re able to go and grab your gun. I think Blaire, you haven’t gone in a bit.
Kim: I think I would like to give throwing knives a try.
Rhi: Okay. I’ll also add, just, kind of, for the atmosphere here. Because of all the alarms, the prisoners in this hallway are all awake, and they are all cheering you on.
Kim: Oh hell yeah.
Rhi (as Prisoner): Kick his ass!
Josie: Hit him with the chair!
Kim: Hey! Riot!
Rhi: The prisoners really like you guys. You’re very popular in Ironhook.
Kim: Nice. So, to throw my knives at one of these guys, would that be Hunt? Skirmish? Finesse?
Rhi: I have allowed Hunt and Finesse for that.
Kim: I would like to use Finesse, because I have a higher rank in that.
Rhi: Okay. Risky position, reduced effect.
Kim: Okay. 4.
Rhi: So, you do it. You throw the knife and it sticks into his chest, but you can tell it doesn’t, like, sink all the way in, because there’s armour that absorbs some of it. So, like, he’s hurt, but it’s not a fatal blow. He’s clutching at the knife and at that moment, two sets of doors burst open.
Minna: Oh, fuck.
Rhi: Behind you, the door opens admitting another handful of guards from upstairs.
Minna and Josie: [groan]
Rhi: And in front of you, rounding the corner, is another group of guards. This is, like, six guards.
Madge: Please no.
Josie: Jesus.
Rhi: But at the head of them is a Bluecoat. And Madge, I’m going to ask you to describe Darmot, with the one requirement that he has a spectacular moustache.
Kim: [gasp]
Josie: [giggles] Excellent.
Madge: Good, okay, I’m glad that’s a requirement because I was thinking that.
Rhi: He can look like whatever else you want, but he must have–
Madge: I was thinking Tom Selleck in Blue Bloods, though.
Rhi: Okay, yeah.
Josie: That, that’s great.
Kim: Please don’t do this to me.
[laughter]
Josie: Type number one, Dads.
Rhi: Yes. Basically.
Madge: Dads with moustaches, specifically.
Kim: God dammit.
Rhi: So, he comes around the corner, leading this group of guards and, like, kind of strikes a pose, points at Needle, and goes:
Rhi (as Darmot): Devin! I’ve finally caught up with you.
Josie: Oh no.
Madge (as Needle): Is it really catching up with me, though, if I got here first?
Rhi (as Darmot): You’re not going to be leaving this place.
Madge (as Needle): Pretty sure I’m getting out of this place.
Rhi: And he kind of, like, gestures to his guards, like:
Rhi (as Darmot): Guards, get her!
Madge (as Needle): Well. It’s been fun.
Madge: I’m gonna bolt, and as I go, every couple of cells that I’m by, I’m gonna stop and I’m gonna unlock it, so that I let people out to block my way.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. So, we see the guards, because they’re farther down the hall, you two were, kind of, shouting dramatically at each other. You get four cells open. But like I said, down on this level there’s four to six people per cell. So there’s now, we’ll just say an average, there’s about 20 prisoners that have just poured out into the hall.
Josie: Oh, thank you.
Minna: I love this, I love this!
Josie: Well, that escalated quickly.
Rhi: Yeah. Needle just, sort of, vanishes into this crowd. You can hear Darmot shouting angrily, being like:
Rhi (as Darmot): Get them out of the way, I can’t, I can’t let her get away again! Not when I’m this close!
Madge (as Needle): Or when you’re this far!
Rhi: And the prisoners are just, kind of, swarming. Some of them are trying to get out, some of them are going after the guards in Darmot’s group. The guards now are just kind of like, ‘Oh shit, who do we deal with?’ It is absolute chaos. So, for the four of you that are still here, what are you gonna do?
Josie: I believe we should escape.
Minna: Yes. Slide out through that crowd.
Kim: Yes, but also Needle?
Josie (as Minx): It seems as though she has dealt with this person before.
Kim (as Blaire): But–
Josie (as Minx): Judging by the drama.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re leaving without her?
Josie (as Minx): Well, the hall will circle around, correct? She may just come around the bend.
Kim (as Blaire): What if she gets caught?
Josie (as Minx): Well, I mean, we…
Josie: Minx is going to start walking towards the exit in the midst of this hullabaloo, and be like:
Josie (as Minx): Well, we’ve broken in once.
Madge (as Phin): We can, yeah, walk and talk, come on.
Kim: I mean, Blaire’s following, but she’s also like:
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, but, we can’t do this twice.
Madge (as Phin): She’s probably rich. She looked rich, is she rich?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): She’s definitely rich.
Madge (as Phin): Then she’ll get a slap on the wrist and she’ll be out in a week.
Minna (as Myra): Her family may not help her, for all we know.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps we can check on her once we’re away from the scrimmage?
Kim (as Blaire): …Okay.
Rhi: Are you guys just trying to head back out the way you came in?
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. I think, just to, sort of, get through this whole riot situation, I’m gonna need rolls.
Josie: Okay.
Madge: Alright.
Josie: I’m gonna do a Skirmish.
Rhi: Okay. They are all gonna be risky.
Josie: 4.
Madge: 6.
Kim: 5.
Minna: I would like to do a Finesse and push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Like, just sliding in between people. That is a 6.
Rhi: Okay. So, Phin and Myra make it through the crowd no problem. Myra is just, kind of like…
Minna: She’s taking every gap that Phin makes.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Yeah. Phin is punching people out of the way, and Myra is just like, ‘Okay, I’ll slip through here and through here’. Blaire, as you’re trying to make your way through this crowd, somebody, you’re not sure if it’s a prisoner or a guard, you’re not even sure if the blow is aimed at you, just smacks you across the back and sends you sprawling. And you, kind of like, you hit the ground hard, you know, skin your palms, and you’re gonna take level 2 harm, Battered. Because as you get to the edge of the crowd, you just get hit and jostled and knocked down.
Kim: Alright.
Rhi: Minx, you had also been, sort of, you know, punching or fighting your way through. You get through, you get to the door that’s gonna lead to those stairs that’s gonna get you all out of here, you open it up and find yourself face-to-face with a guard who is holding a rifle aimed at you. So, you’re in a desperate position.
Minna: [gasp]
Josie: Oh dear. Um… uh… can I shoot first?
Rhi: You can try. But, desperate position, reduced effect.
Josie: You know what? This is in a doorway, right? I want to dodge out of the way of the doorway.
Rhi: Okay, so you’re gonna try to dodge rather than shoot?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. It’s still gonna be desperate, but standard effect for dodging, I think.
Josie: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: The crew is gonna take an additional +1 heat because of this. That guy got a real good look at your face.
Josie: Yeah, I’m gonna do that. I really don’t wanna get shot.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: 6.
Rhi: Yeah, so you barely manage to dodge out of the way. The shot cracks across. Yeah, so the way out is blocked by a guy with a gun. Who wants to do something?
Madge: Yeah, I wanna stab another person. I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Madge: I’m gonna wreck.
Rhi: Alright.
Madge: I miss that. 5 is my highest.
Rhi: I think that Phin just gets shot. She tackles this guy, throws him down the stairs and it’s gonna be, just kind of like, along the side. Level 2 harm.
Kim: Nooo!
Rhi: The gun goes off, I’m imagining that, like, Phin just tackles this guy and he goes down the stairs, but in that tackle he gets a shot off.
Kim: Nooo.
Rhi: Phin is gonna take level 2 harm.
Josie: Can I, since I’m right there, like, get an arm around my shoulders so that I can help her out?
Madge: Yeah.
Rhi: Yep. So, that guy goes sprawling down the stairs, and the four of you hobble your way down the stairs, back out the way you came in. Kay has been, kind of, going up and down the river, and paddles over very quickly to catch up with you. And, you know, when she sees Phin, she gives you one of those nice claps on the shoulder and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Good to see you again.
Madge (as Phin): Good to see you too.
Rhi (as Kay): Let’s get out of here.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. Let’s get out of here.
Josie (as Minx): Thanks for the pickup, dear.
Rhi: She paddles you away from Ironhook and there are, you know, just alarms ringing out through the night.
Kim: Oh shit, we did it.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Indeed.
Rhi: So, you all have made it out of Ironhook. Kay took kind of a roundabout route back through the canals to get you all home. You head back into the nest. And where do Phin and Myra, kind of, have this chat?
Minna: It could be in Myra’s room, for privacy?
Madge: I was thinking either in her room or on, like, the roof of The Nest.
Minna: Aww, that’s really cute.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, I really like the idea of, like, Phin just went up to the roof because she’s been inside for two and a half months.
Minna: I think Myra finds her after she’s gotten a chance to, like, wash up. So she searches the nest for Phin, and eventually sees the open trapdoor to the roof and climbs up the ladder.
Minna (as Myra): Hey.
Madge (as Phin): Hey.
Minna (as Myra): I cannot tell you how good it is to see your face again.
Madge (as Phin): It’s really good to be out.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Minna: Myra comes and sits next to her.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs]
Madge (as Phin): I’m not gonna be able to stay.
Minna (as Myra): Oh. Yeah, I kinda wondered about that.
Madge (as Phin): Cause if I go back there to my family and tell them that they can’t be used for blackmail anymore, they’re gonna know that I got out, and they’re gonna kick me back in and it’s gonna be longer, if not worse. But if they think that I just vanished into thin air and died, then they’re safe, you guys are safe.
Minna (as Myra): So, I can’t tell them that you’re alive?
Madge (as Phin): I’ll send word, eventually.
Minna (as Myra): Okay.
Madge (as Phin): Just, it’ll be on me. Don’t even worry about it.
Minna (as Myra): I’m gonna miss you.
Madge (as Phin): I’m gonna miss you too.
Minna (as Myra): When are you leaving, do you know?
Madge (as Phin): I’m thinking leviathan hunter is gonna be my best bet.
Minna (as Myra): Thought you didn’t like anything like that.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, normally I don’t. But it’s either that or a train, and I hate trains more than leviathans, so. I’m leaving tomorrow.
Minna (as Myra): Tomorrow?
Madge (as Phin): Mm-hmm.
Minna (as Myra): Oh.
Madge (as Phin): I haven’t told Blaire yet.
Minna (as Myra): I just, I can’t believe it’s happening like this, I guess. I always knew it wasn’t gonna be, you know, all of us forever, because that’s an impossibility in this city, but…
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. I honestly thought I was gonna be in a box at this point, so.
Minna (as Myra): Well, I hope you find something better than this out there.
Madge (as Phin): Maybe I will, maybe I won’t. But, the point of the matter is I’m not gonna go quiet.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. I didn’t think you ever would.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah. In the end, that’s really the point of it. It’s to live loud enough, so that you make at least a small dent on the world.
Minna (as Myra): Well you’ve already made a pretty big dent here.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah, I made pretty much a crater.
Minna (as Myra): You changed my life forever, so, there’s that.
Madge (as Phin): And you’re gonna change a lot of other lives forever.
Minna (as Myra): I hope so.
Madge (as Phin): Come on, you’re gonna, like, wipe out The Circle of Flame thing, and you’re gonna do right by the whole city, and I’m gonna, like, hear about you all the way over where I am. I’m gonna say, ‘I know her! I know The Magpies. I was one of them, once.’
Minna (as Myra): You’ll always be one of us.
Madge (as Phin): Forever and always.
Rhi: Okay, I think that’s probably a good point to cut, since we’re all crying.
All: [laugh]
Josie: Madge, we’re gonna miss you.
Madge: I’m gonna miss you guys, too.
Minna: [sobs]
Rhi: So, I think that we kinda pan up from the two of you sitting on the roof, up to the stars. And then, it pans back down into Blaire’s room. So, as you’re unpacking all of your things, all of your gear, putting things away, a folded piece of paper flutters out of your bag and falls to the floor.
Kim: She blinks at it and just goes ahead and picks it up.
Madge: It is a letter from Needle.
Madge (as Needle): Blaire– So, things didn’t go as smooth at Ironhook as I was expecting them to go. It was vicious, even for me. Sorry for that. And you’re really fun, and lovely, and so many other wonderful things. But this brought down a whole lot more heat than I was expecting, and it’s not something that I’m ready for, full time. And I’ve got a reputation to uphold, you know. Going in, going out, not drawing down any sort of attention. So, this isn’t exactly goodbye. Okay, it kind of is goodbye. But, I don’t want it to be forever, you know. I might pop back up someday, see how you’re holding up, if you’re still the brains of the whole operation. But, for now, I think it’s best if I stay on my side, and you stay on yours. –Devin.
Kim: She just, you know, she’s sitting down on the floor as she reads this, and she probably just reads over the last couple sentences a few more times, and she kind of just lowers her hands, and the letter, you know, falls down into her lap. Internally, Blaire is in this space where she feels like she could cry, and she really wants to, but she just can’t right now, because she’s still processing it, and she’s kind of numb about it. Yeah, she’s just gonna sit alone in her room and let that sink in.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna and Josie: [sad noises]
Rhi: So, yeah, we fade out there, from Blaire in her room, and fade back to the docks. It’s about dawn, so there’s a little bit of light in the sky. Kind of a greyish light, from the broken shards of the sun, lighting up the sky for a brief bit of time. There is one of the great leviathan hunter ships, belching steam and smoke into the air as its crew is getting ready to set sail, and near the gangplank there are the four Magpies, standing together. I imagine Phin probably has a bag slung over her shoulder.
Madge: Mm-hmm.
Josie: As you do.
Madge: Yeah. Bag slung over her shoulder, new pair of boots, because her old ones got taken. So, she has a fresh pair of boots.
Minna: They were a going-away present that they all pitched in on.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: Yeah. Because, if I recall correctly, her old boots were a gift from her mom.
Madge: Yeah.
Minna: Aww.
Rhi: So, yeah, I like that idea that you guys all got them as a replacement.
Madge: A gift from her other family.
Kim: Oh!
Josie: Aww.
Josie (as Minx): Well, dear, it was… I was about to say a pleasure, and it was, but it was truly wild having you around.
Madge (as Phin): It was a honour getting to know you.
Kim (as Blaire): I, um, made you something, before you go.
Madge (as Phin): Yeah?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Just something to take with ya.
Madge (as Phin): Bring it over here, kid.
Kim: Blaire takes it out from her pocket and she’s gonna hand it over to Phin. It’s a wood carving of a sea serpent, leviathan thing. It’s kind of crude-looking, but stylistically so. And, yeah, she just hands that over to Phin.
Kim (as Blaire): Something to remember.
Madge (as Phin): It’s not like I could forget you, anyway. You’re way too memorable.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah?
Madge: I’m gonna ruffle Blaire’s hair a little bit.
Kim: I’m gonna hug her.
Madge: I’m gonna hug her back.
Kim (as Blaire): Be safe out there, okay?
Madge (as Phin): Alright. And you be safe back here, okay?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Madge (as Phin): I want you to cause all sorts of trouble. I know I hate ghosts, but you better free as many as possible, or else I’m gonna be really disappointed.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs through tears] I will.
Minna: Myra steps forward, and she wraps her arms tightly around Phin, and whispers in her ear:
Minna (as Myra): Sail safe. Set the world on fire.
Madge (as Phin): Just for you.
Madge: Yeah, so Phin is gonna head up to the top of the gangplank of the leviathan hunter. She’s gonna turn back and look at the three Magpies. She’s gonna smile. Wave a little bit. And then she goes below deck.
Rhi: And as the sun fades out of the sky, the leviathan hunter sets off into The Void Sea. And the three Magpies who have stayed in Duskwall stand watching, as the other Magpie sails off into whatever awaits her.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for listening, and an extra special thanks to everyone backing us on Patreon. We have some pretty cool stuff planned for our upcoming one year anniversary including a patrons only bonus episode and a live stream hangout with some of the Magpies cast. If you want to get in on that fun and excitement head over to patreon.com/magpiespodcast.
It’s still very far away, but since badges are on sale I will mention that Minna and I will once again be at GenCon in August. If for some reason our presence is the deciding factor in whether or not you’ll be going, now you know.
Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Josie: Hey folks, it’s Josie. We’re doing something a little different this time. Rather than suggest a single featured charity for you to go through, I’m going to ask that you check out the #TransCrowdFund hashtag on Twitter, Tumblr, and other social media sites. It’s hard for everyone right now, but trans people like me especially have a hard time staying afloat economically due to discrimination and other difficulties. A lot of us don’t really have direct access to the help of charities, and crowdfunding via GoFundMe and other sites is what we’ve got to work with. Please consider donating directly to a queer trans person this month. It’s the most direct way to help out and it means a lot to us. Once again, that’s #TransCrowdFund. Thank you.
Rhi: The government shutdown is now the longest in United States history. Please call your representatives and demand that the government reopen, pay its employees, and waste exactly no money on a racist border wall. If you’re able, donate, ideally cash, to your local food banks who are going to have more and more people turning to them in the coming days and weeks of the shutdown.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:00]
Rhi: We open up on The Nest more than a week after the Ironhook break-in. The Magpies have been keeping their heads down as The Bluecoats are on high alert looking for the intruders who caused such chaos, but you can’t stay hidden inside forever, so what are the three of you up to as you’re starting to make some plans?
Josie: I think Minx is in the middle of doing herself up, because she just got back from her obligation at The Weeping Lady.
Minna: Hnn.
Josie (as Minx): It would be nice to travel a bit more openly again, dears.
Rhi: [laughing] As she’s taking off some kind of dramatic disguise.
Josie: Yes, precisely. [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I agree. I think we need to think seriously about, well, getting the heat off of us and probably onto somebody else.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Well, we do have some experience in that department, although we’d have to deal with it on two fronts this time. I suppose dealing with The Bluecoats will be easiest.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. I think The Bluecoats could be tricked more easily than The Circle.
Josie (as Minx): Right.
Rhi: Take that, Bluecoats.
Kim: Pew-pew-pew-pew. (minor air horn simulation)
[laughter]
Josie: Shots fired.
Josie (as Minx): Do we have any idea on who we can throw some of our heat onto?
Minna (as Myra): Actually, I’ve been thinking about that. You remember that report we found, the police report associated with The Gondoliers?
Josie (as Minx): Vaguely, yes.
Minna (as Myra): And how we dug into Harvale Brogan’s past and found that he had paid off the police and sold out his old crew members.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, the former Umbra Hunters man.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. So, he has a history of betraying those he works with for his own gain. I think we can work with that.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I think we can as well. Set up some… Although, what should we pin on him?
Minna (as Myra): Avrathi’s death. Unquestionably we were the ones who actually did it, but I think we can frame him for being the one who ordered it, because why would a lowly crew from Six Towers kill Ambassador Avrathi?
Josie (as Minx): Ah. Hmm, no doubt they think of us this way no matter how incorrectly. I like your thinking.
Minna (as Myra): I’d prefer they think of us that way for a little while longer.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps.
Minna (as Myra): Hmm. Where does his support come from? Does he have money of his own or do you think all of his money comes from The Circle? Because that’s gonna be pretty key as to whether or not he can convince The Bluecoats to let him off.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Was he working at The Centuralia Club?
Minna (as Myra): He was in charge.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear. Well, then his money comes from that, most assuredly.
Minna (as Myra): So he has money of his own these days.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Minna (as Myra): I think if we want to go that angle we may have to trick his friends after all, because I think those connections are what’s keeping him clean.
Josie (as Minx): Right.
Minna (as Myra): Let’s talk to Lani and Roxanne.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, I suppose we should decide afterwards. Let’s do that.
Rhi: Okay. Where do you want to go to meet up with them?
Josie: I’d love to buy them some drinks in The Hound’s Paw or something.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, later that afternoon or evening you are at your table at The Hound’s Paw. It’s gotten fairly busy. Rigney has already brought you your drinks and he is taking care of some of his other customers. After you’ve been at The Hound’s Paw for 15 minutes or so the door opens and your old friends, Lani and Roxanne, come in. They are looking a lot better than the last time you saw them. I think the last time that you all were together in person was right after the fire when they were watching their life’s work go up in flames.
Josie: [sad groan]
Rhi: Lani looks like she’s maybe lost a little weight. Her cheek bones stand out a little more sharply. She still has a kind of heaviness about her. It’s clear that the loss of The Mirror is still very much weighing on her. Both she and Roxanne brighten up and smile when they see you and come over. Behind them you see Rigney note their entrance and he starts pulling some glasses down for them. Yeah, they come over to the table and Lani waves and signs hello, and Roxanne says:
Rhi (as Roxanne): It’s really good to see you all again.
Josie (as Minx): Likewise. We are still greatly sorry, but glad to see you together.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Yeah, yeah, we’re getting by. I found work keeping the books for a tailor in Charterhall. It’s… Well, it pays the rent. [chuckles]
Josie: [chuckles]
Rhi: They both sit. Rigney just quietly brings over their drinks and then pats Roxanne on the shoulder.
Rhi (as Rigney): They’re on the house.
Rhi: And then he heads back to the bar. Lani takes a sip of her drink and then sets the glass back down and signs.
Rhi (as Lani via Roxanne): So, what did you need?
Josie (as Minx): Well, it is unfortunately a bit of business. We are looking long-term to alleviate some of the fallout from what happened, and we need a refresher on certain details regarding one Harvale Brogan.
Rhi: Roxanne translates, and as she spells out the name Lani makes a face.
Rhi (as Lani via Roxanne): We don’t really have many of our notes left, but we’ve been recreating what we can remember, writing things down. So, what did you want to know?
Josie (as Minx): Well, we need to figure out any weak points he might have. He is step one in taking vengeance for what happened and alleviating strain on both of us. We are looking for perhaps more obvious means of putting him away.
Rhi: They both look a little surprised.
Rhi (as Roxanne): You want to send him to prison?
Minna (as Myra): We would like to make it look like he’s more responsible for this than we are.
Rhi: Roxanne pauses for a moment and glances at Lani who signs a question and looks back.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Um… We’re both wondering, when you say “make him look more responsible for this,” which of your many accomplishments are you referring to?
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): The one that happened in his club under his watch.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Ah. That makes sense. [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): You know, through his much flaunted security.
Rhi (as Roxanne): That does make sense, but it was worth asking. You have been quite busy.
Minna (as Myra): No, I quite understand. Frankly, the fact that you never wrote the story about us rather than them is astonishing.
Rhi (as Roxanne): [chuckles] For as much chaos as you seem to rain down upon Duskwall, it does seem to be doing more good than harm. I can’t say the same for The Circle. So, Harvale’s connections to The Circle…
Rhi: They sign back and forth a little bit, and after a couple moments Roxanne says:
Rhi (as Roxanne): You probably know as much as we do about him right now. He’s got some kind of protection from The Bluecoats. He was the only one not arrested when his whole gang was taken down. He owns The Centuralia Club. He uses what’s left of his old gang as security, although I imagine he’s probably had to hire some new people. Yeah… We could look into some things for you.
Josie (as Minx): I’d hate to put you in any amount of harm’s way given the situation.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Honestly…
Rhi: She looks at Lani who nods vigorously as she’s talking and signing.
Rhi (as Roxanne): [exhales] We miss this. [chuckles] Keeping the books is not exactly mentally stimulating, and I’m starting to worry we’re gonna get rusty and lose our edge. We know how to ask questions carefully. We’ll see what we can turn up. Is there specific information? You’re looking for weaknesses and his connections to The Circle, sort of what he does for them?
Josie (as Minx): Correct.
Minna (as Myra): I think we’d be especially curious about the nature of the support he gets from them.
Rhi (as Roxanne): That may be a bit tricky, but…
Minna (as Myra): I understand if you cannot get that. Absolutely understandable.
Rhi (as Roxanne): We’ll see what we can find out.
Josie (as Minx): A thought occurs. He still has some amount of protection from The Bluecoats for selling out his old gang, correct?
Rhi (as Roxanne): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): Knowing the exact nature of their agreement might be useful. I see no reason why one who has exploited that before might not exploit it again, like specifically to The Bluecoats.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Yes. That’s why I was a bit skeptical when you said you wanted to send him to prison. He’s paid them off before to avoid that exact fate and he’s far wealthier now. But whatever the nature of their arrangement is, we could try to find that out. It may be worth all of you pulling some strings as well. We can only cover so much ground.
Josie (as Minx): Of course.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. We can work on that.
Josie (as Minx): If we can play on that we might in fact be able to get The Circle to do our work for us.
Rhi (as Roxanne): That would be convenient. Heh.
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Roxanne): All right. Yeah, we can do this. This will be good to sort of get back into the swing of things even if it’s just for a little bit.
Kim (as Blaire): Also, you two could never lose your edge. You two are too good.
Rhi: Lani gives you a big smile, reaches over and pats your hand, and then signs back.
Rhi (as Lani via Roxanne): Thank you. That’s very sweet.
Rhi: Yeah. The two of them are gonna head out, looking like they’ve got a little bit more of a spring in their steps. As they’re leaving they’re signing back and forth to each other very quickly and making plans.
The way that Experts work, since this is the first time we’re doing this, they are able to accomplish certain tasks for the crew independently, which basically means I roll their quality. An Expert is quality equal to your current crew tier +1. It’ll be 2d6. I’ll just roll 2d6 to see how well they do. It’s basically a fortune roll.
It’s gonna take them a little while before they get back to you with information. do you all want to try to do any Gather Information checks before they get back to you, or do you want to wait and see what they find out, and then base your Gather Info checks on that?
Minna: I’d say wait.
Kim: yeah. Maybe we should wait on them.
Rhi: Okay. It’s gonna be a couple days. Is there anything that you all want to do in that time?
Kim: I didn’t get a chance to say this earlier, because I was a dummy, but Blaire is still kind of lovesick so she’s kind of withdrawn.
Others: Aww…
Kim: She’s been kind of down. She’s been writing cheesy poetry in her journal.
Rhi: Oh nooo~!
Minna: [breathy] Oh my God…
Josie: Hnn…
Rhi: [whimpers]
Kim: [giggles]
Rhi: I am now 110% onboard with having a conversation about that.
Kim: Okay. [giggles]
Minna: Yesss.
Rhi: Set me the scene for where this happens. You’ve got two or three days between when you see Lani and Roxanne, between when they’re gonna come back.
Kim: Yeah. I think for once Blaire is in the common area. That’s the only way this is going to work, because no one’s allowed in her room, ever, ever-ever.
Rhi: It’s more for your safety than anything else.
[laughter]
Kim: Yeah. She is sitting at the common room table and she is kind of hunched over the table. Not hunched, she’s like laying over the table, very bent over it, and she’s scribbling in her journal very pathetic love poems and letters and stuff. She’s still very not over Needle disappearing.
Rhi: Yeah. All three of you are probably still feeling the aftereffects of Phin’s departure as well.
Minna: Mm-hmm. [sad groan]
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Blaire’s just kind of got it doubled.
Kim: Yeah. That’s pretty much what it is.
Josie: I think that as Blaire is super engrossed in something, suddenly Minx is kind of over her shoulder sipping on a wine glass.
Josie (as Minx): I didn’t know you were a poet, dear.
Kim: She immediately slams the book shut.
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t look! [whiney] Don’t look! I’m not… Shut up.
Josie (as Minx): [chuckling] It’s okay. I didn’t see anything specific.
Kim (as Blaire): [pouts]
Josie (as Minx): Besides, love makes artists of us all, I think.
Josie: She’ll take a seat.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m not an artist… and I’m sorry I told you to shut up.
Josie (as Minx): [smiling] It’s all right, dear.
Minna: I think Myra comes and settles next to them with an extra mug of tea for Blaire that she sets in front of her.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, thanks… Wait. Am I in trouble?
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] No. Of course not.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s just… I don’t know. Everyone’s staring at me and I don’t know why.
Minna (as Myra): Well, I’m not staring if it helps.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, it’s just… I don’t know. All of a sudden everyone’s here. I don’t know what that means.
Minna (as Myra): If you would like to be left alone we can leave you alone. You just seemed a little sad.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, and?
Josie (as Minx): You might need some company given that a certain amorous company is indisposed at the moment.
Kim (as Blaire): [grunts]
Josie (as Minx): Do you wanna talk about it at all?
Kim: Blaire kind of swings her feet as she thinks about it.
Kim (as Blaire): Mmm… No.
Josie (as Minx): That’s quite all right, dear. I have been in this spot many times myself. I’m sure that’s a surprise to you.
Josie: Flashback to what a Minx breakup looks like.
[laughter]
Minna: Seeing you in breakup mode—We’ve talked about this!
Rhi: Yeah. I was just gonna say, flashback to a montage of Minx returning to The Nest and just swanning about dramatically and flinging herself down on a fainting couch with a hand over her eyes.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, it’s not really a surprise. I mean, have you looked at me?
Minna (as Myra): Now what’s that supposed to mean?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, I’m not sure.
Kim (as Blaire): Well… I don’t know. I’m not exactly the most datable person. So, like, this is stupid. I should have seen this.
Josie (as Minx): Dear, what are you talking about? Needle was lucky to have you. Any girl would be lucky to have you.
Kim (as Blaire): [uncertain hum]
Josie (as Minx): You’re passionate. You have interesting hobbies. You’re certainly adorable in a way that brings things out of people… And you’re a poet.
Kim (as Blaire): [whining] No… I’m not~
[laughter]
Minna (as Myra): [smiling] Maybe you don’t want to share that part of you with other people, which is fair.
Kim (as Blaire): [stubbornly] I don’t… it’s bad. Don’t look at it.
Josie (as Minx): I’m not looking at it, dear. I’m just saying you have many talents and virtues, many of which have become very apparent to us and I think are more apparent than you think.
Minna (as Myra): We like you.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks. I like you guys too.
Josie (as Minx): That warms my heart to hear. Indeed, I can hardly imagine this crew without you.
Kim (as Blaire): I can’t really imagine it without Phin either.
Minna (as Myra): I know, she’s always been here, but we’re gonna have to find a way to imagine it and sticking with each other seems like the best way to start.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): [softly] I miss her.
Minna (as Myra): Me too.
Josie (as Minx): Quite. She brought a certain something.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know how we’re gonna do with this new direction without her. She’s the one who showed me that it was possible.
Kim (as Blaire): Hmm.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I think her point may have been that it doesn’t necessarily take someone special to do this.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. It just takes a lot of determination.
Josie (as Minx): Correct, and we’re not doing it to be special or superior, we’re doing it for the people we care about.
Minna (as Myra): Like you.
Kim (as Blaire): Wait, me?
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Who was I looking at, Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): -I don’t know. I wasn’t looking.
Josie (as Minx): Besides, this is hardly a permanent situation, I think. I think Needle will show up at some point again.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah…
Josie: Does Blaire allow me to ruffle her hair?
Kim: You know what… Sure.
Rhi & Josie: [giggles]
Kim: She’s not too happy about it, but she’ll let you.
Josie: I think at that point Minx is gonna stand up to go get herself some more wine.
Josie (as Minx): In the meantime, there are other leviathans in the sea as Phin might say, and you have time to hone your craft.
Kim (as Blaire): [grumbling] I don’t want a leviathan, I want a Needle-fish.
Minna: Hnn!
Josie: Hnn!
Rhi: [laughs] smiling] Oh my God…
Kim: Oh, I’m proud of that.
Josie: That’s adorable!
Kim: hee-hee-hee.
Minna: [smiling] You didn’t even throw anything at her for the pun.
Rhi: [smiling] No. it was too pure.
Kim: [giggles]
Rhi: Ah… So, a few days pass while you all are still laying low, but starting to mentally prepare at least for this upcoming score. You check in at The Hound’s Paw and get a message from Lani and Roxanne. The message is a couple sentences. It says that they suspect Brogan provides most of the funding for The Circle, that a lot of the money comes through him, via the club.
Minna: Oh, so he’s the money. Okay. [giggles]
Rhi: They found some people who remembered that Brogan used to pass evidence to a chief inspector named Gilbert Severin, and that might be a person to investigate in some more detail. That was the inspector who led the takedown of The Umbra Hunters. After the takedown the two of them spent a lot of time working together shoring up the case as Harvale was handing over evidence.
Josie: Interesting.
Rhi: Yeah. So, that is the information that they are able to provide you. That’s the lead. What do you want to do with it?
Minna: [through hands] I know someone I can ask about that.
Rhi: Yeah, you do know somebody you could ask some questions.
Minna: That could be a fun conversation, because this guy is clearly crooked, so like… Hey Jeren, maybe you could help me with this.
Rhi: Yeah. Let’s start with Minx.
Josie: Okie-dokie.
Rhi: What is your plan? What’s your approach?
Josie: I just want to talk to people who I know go to the club, and just sort of drop in conversation the weird connection Brogan might have and see if that reveals anything. I’ll talk about it like it’s common knowledge.
Rhi: Just some hot goss’.
Josie: Yeah, exactly.
Rhi: Gotcha. Yeah, go ahead and make a roll for that.
Josie: I feel like Consort is the deal.
Rhi: Probably Consort or Sway.
Josie: Are you saying I could use Sway for this one?
Rhi: Yeah. I think you could do either one.
Josie: Yes! And I get an extra d6 on Gather Information. I got a 5.
Rhi: So standard amount of info. I think since Minx’s various noble personas have been missing for a few months, when you return people are very happy to see you, they were wondering where you were, they were so worried.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Basically you end up in one of these fine cafes up in Brightstone holding court at a table with a bunch of young nobles or young up-and-coming merchants, people with a lot of money. You’re spending a couple hours talking and telling all of these stories about your fantastic trip around the continent and how glad you are to be back here and how you’ve missed the club, and people start telling you about all of the drama you missed at the club. Eventually you weave it around to mentioning this connection between Harvale Brogan and this Chief Inspector Severin.
Most of the people at the table don’t really seem to know what you’re talking about or just don’t find it very interesting, but there’s a young noble who kind of leans over to you as the conversation drifts in another direction and says that a friend of their cousin’s is fairly high up in The Bluecoats and has heard some rumors that Brogan came on the scene very suddenly about six or seven years ago but seemed to already be not quite friends with Severin but they worked together. Brogan seemed to have a lot of underworld contacts and had apparently seen the light of law, and had started handing over evidence and was acting as a double agent, it was all very dramatic. Severin was the person who was kind of his handler, and then Brogan came into all kinds of money and bought The Centuralia Club and took over, but it seems like they’ve maintained some kind of connection and relationship even though presumably Brogan isn’t feeding him information anymore.
Josie (as Minx): Interesting. That is a more intricate history than I expected. I thought it might be merely a secret dalliance.
Rhi (as Noble): Well, who’s to say? It could be multiple things.
Josie (as Minx): [chuckling] Quite.
Minna: Ehh…
Josie: Yeah. I think I want to know if they are still connected or rather if they actively spend time around each other, you know, digging further into the juicy secrets here.
Rhi: Sort of digging for gossip? Yeah. They don’t spend a lot of time together, but whenever they do it’s always because Brogan has gone seeking out Severin, and it’s usually once or twice a year. It’s not very frequent that they have contact, but you know, Brogan will turn up at the Bluecoat station where Severin works every now and then and they’ll have fairly brief chats, then Brogan will go on his way. Most people just assume it’s some kind of bribe thing, because that’s a fairly common thing for The Bluecoats.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: You show up, you pay your bribes, you go back to whatever your business is. So it could be bribery, it could be maybe he’s still feeding Severin information.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. That raises the question of what has he to bribe for. Surely he is of upstanding station.
Rhi (as Noble): Well, you’ve been to the club…
Josie (as Minx): True enough. True enough.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Although, speaking of, I’ve heard that…
Josie: …and then I’m just gonna spit off into some other made up gossip. [laughs]
Rhi: Some other scandal. Yeah. I think that’s about the information that Minx is able to get. Meanwhile, I assume at a familiar Nightmarket café?
Minna: Yes. We are meeting in that familiar café.
Rhi: We’ve got Myra and Jeren.
Minna: I think a much more private table than usual. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, more towards the back, in a corner. Jeren looks concerned as he has pretty much every time you’ve met up with him recently. Oh man, you all left your name on the Ironhook thing, didn’t you?
Minna: Did we…? Ohh, we left a pin~!
Rhi: During your badass cool walk you flipped a pin to one of the prisoners, so he does know that you were involved in that.
Minna: I think when she sits down she just kind of does so in silence and waits for the inevitable. [laughing]
Rhi: Yeah. He’s just pinching the bridge of his nose.
Rhi (as Jeren): Ironhook…? Really?
Minna (as Myra): It was for one of my dearest friends.
Rhi (as Jeren): Would this happen to be the friend who, you know…?
Rhi: And he mimes a pistol firing with his hand.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] I don’t expect you to approve, but she’s gone, so… No need to worry.
Rhi: The concern goes from an expression that you now recognize as “Myra, what have you done” to more of an expression of actually being concerned for you.
Rhi (as Jeren): Gone? Do you mean, like, she—
Minna (as Myra): No, she’s not dead. She left town, because it was safer for her family, because it is in fact very dangerous to live in this city.
Rhi (as Jeren): What did her family have to do with it?
Minna (as Myra): Actually, and I know you don’t want to hear this, but it was the local Bluecoats who were targeting her family. They couldn’t get at Phin so they got at the people who were more vulnerable. That’s how it works in this city.
Rhi: He sighs and shakes his head.
Rhi (as Jeren): I know. A lot of the individual squads, some of them have problems particularly in rougher areas like The Docks…
Minna (as Myra): You understand, these are people who have been given power over other people and they just use it to be petty tyrants.
Rhi (as Jeren): I know that some of The Bluecoats do abuse it, and…
Minna (as Myra): I’m not trying to have this argument right now. Don’t worry about Ironhook. That’s done now.
Rhi: [smiling] He makes a face at you but doesn’t press the subject any further.
Minna (as Myra): Speaking of Bluecoats gone rogue…
Rhi (as Jeren): Mm-hmm?
Minna (as Myra): We have some information about someone quite high up in The Bluecoats who has a connection to a criminal and we are trying to determine what that criminal has on him.
Rhi (as Jeren): You think there’s some kind of blackmail?
Minna (as Myra): Maybe. We’re not really sure. This guy stayed free and easy for years now when he really shouldn’t be.
Rhi (as Jeren): Who’s the Bluecoat?
Minna (as Myra): The Bluecoat is Gilbert Severin. The criminal would be Harvale Brogan, owner of The Centuralia Club.
Rhi (as Jeren): Um…
Minna (as Myra): Chief Inspector.
Rhi (as Jeren): [anxiously] I am aware of who Chief Inspector Severin is.
Minna (as Myra): We’re not going after Severin, if it helps.
Rhi (as Jeren): It does, actually. It helps a lot.
Rhi: At this point you’ll need to make a roll to see what Jeren knows.
Minna: Yes. [laughing] Oh my God… Conversations with Jeren are so stressful.
Rhi: He just wants you to have a nice, quiet life not making waves.
Minna: Listen. I’ve told him that’s not possible.
Rhi: I know. He’s just having a hard time.
Minna: Ha-ha! It’s a 6.
Rhi: Okay!
Rhi (as Jeren): Yes. I know who Chief Inspector Severin is. He worked in my station for several years before he just got transferred over to the headquarters in Six Towers just a year or two ago. I do remember Brogan showing up every now and then to see him, but I never really thought much of it. Severin is a very accomplished inspector. He’s taken down some pretty serious criminals. He kind of got his start with taking out The Umbra Hunters a while back.
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm. Brogan’s old gang.
Rhi (as Jeren): What?
Minna (as Myra): Oh! You didn’t know about that. Oh, this is some juicy gossip. Do you wanna know?
Rhi (as Jeren): Uhh… I mean, you kind of already said it.
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Brogan gave up his old gang to Severin. He was Severin’s agent, turned on the old gang, got all of them turned in and got the gang in return. Rather, he turned in the fellow leaders and he got leadership of the gang in return. And safety, and freedom. But we don’t know why he’s still out there and nobody’s touched him, since six or seven years is a long time.
Rhi (as Jeren): Oh… Yeah… Inspector Severin is a… I mean, I’m sure you know about the inspectors. They’re not like the rank and file that apparently harass families on The Docks. They’re dedicated and committed and basically immune to corruption.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, supposedly “unbribable” and “detached” and “good judges.”
Rhi (as Jeren): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): Wouldn’t it be lovely if that were the case?
Rhi (as Jeren): [sighs] Well, there must be something then. If Severin… If he knew about that connection he wouldn’t just let Brogan go free for no reason. There must be something there.
Minna (as Myra): That’s what I’m saying. I was wondering if you knew anything. You’re the only one I know who might have anything on Severin. Any strange habits? Any, I don’t know, weird little routines?
Rhi (as Jeren): I mean, he’s dedicated to the work. When he was at my office he always worked very long hours. He had this weird habit of when he was thinking or listening he would sort of tap his fingers on the side of his head. I think he moved to Six Towers, I think he has an apartment over there now.
Minna (as Myra): So, anything you’ve got, anything about where he might be, if there’s anything he might have left behind in the office? Anything you can get me on him, basically, we’re trying to figure this out.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah… Yeah. I’ll see what I can come up with. I’ll drop anything off at The Hound’s Paw for you.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, you know where to find me.
Rhi: What he’s able to get you is, like I said, Severin’s address in Six Towers and the station that he works at now. I’m trying to think of something that he might have left behind.
Minna: Maybe something that doesn’t mean anything mundanely but might still have this weird echo in the ghost field.
Rhi: Ooh, yeah, that’s a good one.
Minna: Maybe just some notes that don’t end up meaning anything.
Rhi: I was gonna say he had a pen and ink well set that he always used when he was there, that he left that, and Jeren is just like “I don’t know if you can get anything off of this but you asked me for things he left behind so here.” There might just be some random papers that are just like to-do lists and stuff like that which don’t have any notes that are super relevant to things but it’s stuff that he worked with a lot.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: That might be a fun thing for Blaire to investigate.
Minna: Yeah~
Josie: Ooh.
Kim: Yeah. I was just thinking about that.
Minna (as Myra): Hey Blaire…
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm?
Minna (as Myra): This is probably nothing, but I was just talking to a friend in The Bluecoats about Severin.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay?
Minna (as Myra): Something kind of stuck out to me and I don’t know if it means anything, but noticeably the guy seems to have, like, fidgets? He’ll tap the side of his head when he’s thinking. I mean, everyone fidgets, but if it sticks out that much, you know, it seems like it might be something.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, it’s hard to tell just based on description. It depends on, like, does it look natural for this person or not. Do they suddenly look very mechanical, or is it just a natural fidget? Do you know what I mean?
Minna (as Myra): So, when I was younger I used to twist my fingers together quite a lot in stressful situations. I don’t do that anymore, but…
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm. You have a point, yeah. If it looked weird to him, it’s a possibility that it’s a sign of possession, but again it’s not 100% a foolproof method of proving whether or not someone is or isn’t possessed.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. Actually, I wanted you to take a look at some of these things. You have better eyes than I do.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] Ooh! Uh-huh?
Minna (as Myra): I have some objects from his old office.
Kim (as Blaire): Ooh. Okay.
Minna: She takes out the ink well and the papers and hands them over.
Kim (as Blaire): What do you want me to do with them?
MYRA: I don’t know. You know more about this stuff than I do. Would there be some kind of way of telling if the person they belonged to…
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… I don’t know! Let’s find out!
Kim: Blaire is gonna put on her spirit mask. I would like to roll Attune for my Gather Information.
Rhi: All right.
Kim: I get +1 because it’s Gather Information. First roll with the new dice, people!
Rhi: Woohoo.
Josie: Woo!
Minna: Yeah~!
Josie: They’re all 1s.
Kim: Nope! No. I got two 1s and a 6, so we’re going with that.
Rhi: Okay. So… Blaire, you pick up a couple of the things and concentrate on them in the ghost field, and you start to see… It’s difficult to do object reading where you can look at an object and see its history, and it’s easier and works best if you’re seeing the object in the place where it was used.
Kim: I see. Yeah.
Rhi: So here in The Nest it’s detached, but you are able to see with the ink well and pen the ghostly movements of a pair of floating hands moving as if writing with the pen and using the ink well and whatnot. You can tell with the hands, you’ve done this before occasionally, been able to see these sort of echoes, and if it’s just a regular living person it just looks like a faded out, translucent hand. There is that, but then overlaid on it is a bright, glowing, ghostly hand that seems to be intertwined with the regular hand. So you’re like, huh, okay, well… [chuckles]
Kim: Okay. Yeah. Blaire is gonna take her mask off and look at Myra.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no dude, this guy was totally possessed.
Minna (as Myra): Do you think that could be it?
Kim (as Blaire): A hundred percent.
Minna (as Myra): That’s big. A chief inspector possessed?
Kim (as Blaire): A big sign of corruption. It wouldn’t be very good publicity for The Bluecoats.
Minna (as Myra): Not at all… We have to find a way to prove it. If somebody else has proof, if that’s indeed what Harvale has, then…
Kim (as Blaire): Hmm.
Minna (as Myra): Or maybe we find Harvale’s proof if that’s what he’s got. I don’t know. This might be our in.
Kim (as Blaire): I think this is definitely our in.
Josie: It sounds like we might have enough to start planning something.
Kim: I think so.
Rhi: Okay. What are you all thinking?
Josie: Well, Myra was right that Brogan’s gotta have some sort of proof to hold over Severin, so finding that would be pretty imperative.
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: Do we find Brogan?
Minna: I think we figure out where the heck we think Brogan would keep his valuables.
Josie: right, because Brogan himself is gonna be pretty hard to get at.
Kim: Yeah. Would The Gondoliers know by any chance?
Josie: Hmm. Maybe?
Rhi: You could ask.
Josie: I would… I don’t know. Would I feel really bad about just blackmailing him back? Like we steal the proof, and then it’s like no, we’re your blackmailers now. [laughs]
Minna: I feel like that’s exactly what we do.
Kim: Yeah. That’s kind of what we have to do, though.
Josie: Oh, okay. All right. That’s fine. Let’s do that.
Rhi: Okay. I think the last piece of information you need is figuring out…
Minna: Where he hides it.
Kim: Hmm.
Josie: Yeah. I mean, we could just ask The Gondoliers.
Rhi: All right. Are the three of you gonna troop on down there?
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: Who are you gonna go talk to? Are you gonna talk to Kay or are you gonna talk to some of the higher ups?
Josie: I want to talk to some of the higher ups, although I would like to say hi to Kay.
Rhi: You head to The Gondoliers headquarters down in the canals. Most of them give you a wave as you arrive. Kay is there doing some work on her boat. She’s doing some repair work on it and is just in like a sleeveless top and is all muscly and slightly glistening with sweat.
Josie: … Fuck, I’m gay. Thank you, Rhi.
Rhi: [smiling] I gotcha.
Josie: You got me. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I will come up behind and just gently rest a hand on her shoulder.
Josie (as Minx): Hello dear.
Rhi (as Kay): Oh. Hey. Good to see you all in one piece after last time.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Well, it wasn’t the worst rough and tumble we’ve been through.
Rhi (as Kay): That’s very true. I wasn’t rowing you away with you being gut-shot again, so that’s an improvement.
Josie (as Minx): [chuckles]
Kim (as Blaire): One time!
Josie (as Minx): Although that evening did lead to certain better times.
Rhi (as Kay): [chuckles] True. Did you all need me for something? I’m afraid I can’t give you a ride anywhere just now.
Josie (as Minx): Oh. I was just coming by to say hi. Us as a group were hoping to talk to your boss.
Rhi (as Kay): Oh, yeah. Eisele’s in her office. You can probably just head on in.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you, dear.
Josie: Out of character, are we in a place where a peck on the cheek would be untoward or welcomed?
Rhi: No, it would be fine. She gave you a kiss on the cheek when you were heading into Ironhook.
Kim: [squeaks]
Josie: Oh right, yes. Yeah, so I’ll give her a peck back and then head into the office.
Rhi: Okay. So, Eisele is at her desk looking over a map of the city and muttering to herself. She looks up when you come in.
Rhi (as Eisele): Ah, Duskwall’s biggest troublemakers. What can I do for you?
Josie: Minx makes to open her mouth but then quickly shuts it and steps back, gesturing Myra forward.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: She’s learning~!
Minna: [laughing] Is this the one that didn’t like Minx?
Rhi: Bless. Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): We were looking for some information.
Rhi (as Eisele): Mm-hmm?
Minna (as Myra): Harvale Brogan, former Umbra Hunters leader, current owner of The Centuralia Club. We’re hoping to find something secret he has stashed away.
Rhi (as Eisele): Huh. All right.
Rhi: Go ahead and give me a roll to see what she knows.
Minna: Five.
Rhi (as Eisele): Well, anything to take that piece of canal scum down. There’s the club. He’s got a nice swank place up in Brightstone. Umbra Hunters, they used to work out of Coalridge in the old rail yard. I don’t know if that would be worth checking out.
Minna (as Myra): I know the place. I wonder… Maybe we can start there at least. It would be easier to get into than The Centuralia Club.
Rhi (as Eisele): Or his house, probably.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, I mean, The Centuralia Club would be easier than the house.
Rhi (as Eisele): But yeah, those are the only places I can think of.
Minna (as Myra): That’s helpful information. Thank you.
Rhi (as Eisele): Yeah, well anything else we can do to help…
Minna (as Myra): Of course.
Minna: Myra holds out a hand to shake.
Rhi: Yeah, she shakes.
Rhi (as Eisele): Good luck, and uh, if you happen to send Brogan to his demise…
Rhi: She looks to Blaire and smirks.
Rhi (as Eisele): …pop him in one of those jars and I’ll pay you for it. I wouldn’t mind keeping him on my desk.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] yeah!
[laughter]
Minna: Really, Blaire?
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: So, it sounds like you’re gonna try the rail yard first?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: All right. Engagement roll. One for luck… This operation is not particularly bold or daring in my estimation.
Minna: Yeah, no. It is the least bold option of the ones that we had.
Rhi: [reading] Plans … detail … expose a vulnerability … Friends and contacts have provided aid or insight…
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You’re taking a one die penalty for secrets, so it’s one die.
Kim: What kind of secrets, GM?
Rhi: GM secrets, for the GM to know.
Kim: [squirms]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: [reluctantly] I rolled a 6…
Kim: Woohoo!
Josie: Nice!
## Rail Yard [0:44:35]
Rhi: The three of you pack up your gear. For certain members of the group you dress down appropriate for Coalridge. You make your way into the district, through the residential areas, past the factories that are constantly billowing smoke. There’s the constant clanging sound coming from the mine. You make your way to the old rail yard. It used to be where the trains would come in to collect coal to ship it out across the empire, but after electroplasmic technology was discovered and developed and electroplasmic trains became the norm everything moved over to Gaddoc Rail Station.
There’s dozens upon dozens of abandoned trains here that were just left to rust on their tracks. As you start making your way through you can see a lot of them are just left empty and abandoned, but in a number you can see movement inside, people peering out at you, it looks like some people are living in there. You make your way over to the area where Eisele said The Umbra Hunters had been. It’s a number of train cars that were what looks like decommissioned and piled up on top of each other, so it’s like three cars high, sort of a big train car honeycomb.
Josie: That’s pretty cool.
Rhi: It’s all very rusted and seemingly unoccupied. You make your way over and start poking around looking for an entrance, and as you are doing so you hear some footsteps coming in your direction. This is a heavier gate, booted feet, several people. You hear what sounds like a young woman’s voice say:
Rhi (as Young Woman): According to Brogan it’s over here, up around the next bend. We’ll just setup there and wait.
Minna (as Myra): [quietly] Who tipped him off?!
Rhi: Myra, you recognize that voice.
Minna: Uhh… What? Who?
Josie: Ooh~
Rhi: One of the other apprentices that you worked with. It’s not Clave.
Minna: It’s Ojal?
Rhi: It’s Ojal.
Minna: [yelps] … [covers mouth] Sorry. [giggles] That was Minna having feels.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] I can’t wait to figure out what that means.
Minna: Minna knows the personalities of THREE apprentices! [laughs]
Rhi: They’re still a little ways away. You know they’re coming. They seem to think that they beat you here. They are incorrect.
Minna: Okay. Myra reaches out and grabs the nearest person’s arm.
Rhi: Okay. Who is nearest?
Josie: Agh…?
Rhi: Okay. Apparently Minx has been grabbed. [chuckles]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Okay. We need to get inside before they get here.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. Around the back?
Minna (as Myra): Sounds good. Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah?
Minna (as Myra): We need to move.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, okay! I’m coming.
Rhi: You’re starting to figure out that maybe the reason not many people, or the reason no one has moved in here, is because there’s not really an obvious entrance. For as rusted as this is no holes have formed. The doors to all of the cars are welded shut. It still seems pretty secure, so somebody will need to make some kind of roll to find a way in.
Josie: I have Survey.
Rhi: Yeah, that would work. Because I rolled a 6 for the engagement roll you’re in a controlled position.
Kim: Would you like an assist?
Josie: Yes please. Eh, two 3s.
Rhi: The two of you are looking over this train car pile looking for an entrance, and Myra you’re keeping watch for this approaching group. It’s taking a lot of time, or you suspect that you’re going to need to take a lot of time, so you can either try again but it will be risky or you can withdraw and try a different approach.
Josie: I kind of just want to go in on it again.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Six!
Rhi: So, you stand up, looking-looking-looking, and then you see, it’s kind of hidden by a metal lip coming up off of the train cars, but there is a ladder that leads up. It doesn’t seem to lead to an opening, but as you squint up at it you can see that maybe there’s a door you can push aside or slide out of the way. It looks like an entrance.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Let’s get in there.
Rhi: Yep. You all scramble up the ladder. You’re trying to go fast and quiet and the ladder is not really on board with either of those things. There is some creaking of metal. Once all three of you are on it starts to drift back and forth in a really disconcerting way, but it holds. You make it to the top. Minx, you’re able to slide the little hatch aside and climb in.
It is very dark, it smells like rust and stale air, but all three of you manage to scramble inside. You close the little hatch behind you. You’re basically up inside, like I said, an empty train car, but it was clearly repurposed at one point to be an entry point into this hideout.
There’s a wall that’s been put up about half way through the train car with a door set in it and some slits in the sides where you could fit a pistol through.
Josie: Hmm. Interesting.
Kim: Yeah. How dark is it?
Minna: I think we have to carry lanterns with us all the time anyway to survive in this city.
Kim: Yeah, I was gonna say, let’s mark off a lantern on our load.
Rhi: Yeah. If somebody’s got a lantern you’re fine, you’ll be able to see.
Josie: I’ll take it.
Rhi: Okay. Minx, you have a lantern so you’re able to see everything in here. It’s very quiet in here. You can still hear the muffled noise of the factories and the mines, but there’s just that stillness to the air in here that says nothing has been in here for a long time.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Can we get through the door?
Rhi: When you get up to the door and try it it’s locked.
Josie: Does someone want to try and Tinker that?
Kim: I would be happy to.
Rhi: The lock is a lot newer than everything else around it.
Kim: Hmm!
Rhi: It’s cleaner, brighter, unrusted metal.
Kim: Harder, better, faster, stronger?
Rhi: Yes, exactly. It is that. It is all of those things.
Kim: Okay. I got two 3s.
Rhi: I gotta grab a note card~…
Kim: Why…?
Rhi: Because it’s—
Minna: Clock time~!
Kim: [shrieks] No!
Rhi: It is! Yeah, you start working at the lock. Because it’s newer it’s tougher and it kind of sticks a little bit. This is not a lock that’s opened very often. You’re still struggling with it, and then while you’re working all three of you hear lower in this hideout there’s a loud, muffled thud that then repeats, and repeats… It sounds like they’re just trying to bust their way through.
Josie: Uh-oh.
Kim: Don’t like that.
Rhi: Rather than looking for an entrance, they’re just like eh, we’ll make our own. So, the clock is Ojal’s Team Breaks In, 1 out of 4.
Josie: I’m gonna go out on a limb here and guess that none of us have dots in Wreck.
Kim: [weakly] That was Phin’s job.
Minna: [loudly laugh-sobs]
Josie: Yeah…
Kim: Yeah, no, I have nothing in Wreck.
Minna: Yeah…
Josie: Because I was thinking we might just want to bust through the door, but honestly we probably have better odds trying the lock again.
Kim: Yeah. I don’t mind trying again.
Josie: I’ll assist you this time.
Kim: My highest was a 3.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. I’m ticking the clock up again. You’re just stuck at this door.
Josie: If someone’s breaking in, if it’s a small group, we might be able to just follow them in.
Kim: Hmm. Interesting strategy.
Josie: But if there ends up being six of them then we are in a tight spot.
Kim: What if we had someone try and circle back and peek outside and try to count how many there are, and then based on how many there are we can figure out from there what our strategy will be, whether we continue here or if we follow them in?
Josie: Yes. How about Blaire and I will keep at this lock, Myra do you wanna go around and take a scouting run?
Minna: Yeah, I can do that.
Rhi: Okay. We’ll have Myra take that roll first. Myra, you scramble back down the ladder. It’s a little less terrifying with only one person on it but still not the most fun you’ve ever had. You’ll need to make some kind of roll to do this sneaking and scouting without being seen.
Minna: Oh, so this is a Prowl roll.
Rhi: Probably, yeah.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: You sneak over and you are able to see that there’s five people clustered around one of the train cars. Four of them have what looks like a portable battering ram that they’re just slamming into the side over and over. Those four are in a mix of clothes, nothing that immediately jumps out as a uniform, but as you’re looking you can see pieces of like, oh that’s the black jacket that The Umbra Hunters wear when they’re working at The Centuralia Club, and those two have on the standard issue Bluecoat boots.
Minna: [nervous, emphatically] Uh…?
Rhi: It’s a bit of a mixed group. It looks like it’s a couple Umbra Hunters and a couple Bluecoats. Then, standing behind them, seemingly the one in charge, is Ojal.
Minna: Have I kept up on them at all? Would I know if she’s still with Salia or if she might have switched allegiances?
Rhi: I don’t know. You tell me.
Minna: Hmm… I don’t know! Okay, so backstory, Ojal is the one that Myra probably liked the most although you can’t really trust anybody among the apprentices, and she’s pretty sure that Ojal would be really pissed at her now because she was all about loyalty. So, I think she would have a strong suspicion that she wouldn’t leave Salia.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. You know, make of this situation what you will.
Minna: Myra’s going to assume that Salia’s involved in this somehow as well as Bluecoats and Umbra Hunters.
Rhi: Yeah, so that’s a fun thing to think about.
Minna: Which sounds like an actual nightmare.
Rhi: Ojal glances over and meets your eyes.
Minna: [loud nervous exhale]
Rhi: So we’re gonna cut away from that back up to where Minx and Blaire are trying to get through a door.
Kim: I’ll roll Tinker again.
Josie: Yeah. Do you want another assistance on that?
Kim: That would be fabulous.
Rhi: Do you want a Devil’s Bargain to get that up to three?
Kim: Mmm. What would it look like?
Rhi: Your lock picks are gonna break.
Kim: Ah, classic Skyrim. Okay. I accept.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. [giggles]
Kim: Okay, 6.
Josie: Sweet.
Rhi: You keep working at this lock, you’re working at this lock, and it opens but as it does one of your lock picks just snaps off and half of it is stuck inside the lock.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh well.
Rhi: Door’s open. You’re in. Hurray. Myra has still not come back.
Kim (as Blaire): We should go get her.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. You know what, you continue forward and search, I will go grab our compatriot.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you sure?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. If she’s in trouble she is likely outnumbered, but we also need to get this done.
Kim (as Blaire): [exhales] Okay, but if she is in trouble, holler and I’ll come and help, okay?
Josie (as Minx): I will do that.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. I’m gonna go search.
Rhi: We see Blaire head deeper into the train cars and we follow Minx out to the ladder. Cutting back to Myra, you and Ojal are staring at each other in shock. What does Ojal look like?
Minna: Ojal is a wiry woman, dark skinned, her head is shaved. She has this kind of coiled energy. She always looks like if you launched yourself at her she would immediately be able to counter it.
Rhi: There’s a beat of mutual shock, and then Ojal goes:
Rhi (as Ojal): She’s over there! Move! Now!
Rhi: And the guards, for lack of a better description, look over, drop their portable battering ram, and start coming towards you as they are drawing weapons. Myra, what would you like to do?
Minna: Hmm. I think I’d like to continue to draw their attention frankly, so I think I’ll engage in this out here.
Josie: [laughing] Oh no, Myra!
Rhi: Okay. What does that look like?
Minna: Gonna draw a pistol myself and shoot at one of the people who is not Ojal.
Rhi: Go for it.
Minna: I’m using Hunt.
Rhi: This is desperate so mark xp, because you are vastly outnumbered.
Minna: Oh my God. [laughs] It’s desperate and I rolled a 1.
Josie: No! Myra!
Kim: What the fuck?!
Minna: This is gonna be bad~!
Rhi: It’s gonna be very bad.
Kim: Don’t get shot~
Minna: I think I’m 100% gonna get shot.
Rhi: You’re gonna get shot. You draw a pistol and two of them shoot you. You’re taking level 3 harm.
Minna: Level 3 harm… I would like to resist.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. That’s with Prowess.
Minna: I did actually roll a 6 on that, so I take 0 stress to resist.
Rhi: Okay, it’s down to 2. You are able to dodge one of the shots but you still get hit.
Minna: Where do I take it?
Rhi: I think it’s gonna be a leg shot. I think it hits you in the thigh right above your knee. Your leg gives out and you manage to catch yourself on something nearby, but basically anything where you would be…
Minna: Everything that I’m trying to do. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, you’re gonna be at -1, and things that you were previously able to do freely like climb a ladder are now gonna require rolls.
Minna: Yep~
Rhi: Minx, you come out in time to hear shouting and I think you get to the ground just in time for the gunshots. What do you do?
Josie: I’m thinking Minx came with a heavier artillery this time, because there’s less of us and we need crowd control. What I kind of want to do is run around until I see Myra and then maybe try and pull her back and just lay down a spray at the people who are out there.
Rhi: Yeah, you can do that. What are you gonna roll?
Josie: I would like to roll Skirmish or Hunt, whichever is most fitting.
Rhi: I think that because of the range, and a blunderbuss is kind of a shotgun, it’s gonna be closer. I would allow Skirmish if you wanted, but Hunt or Skirmish would be fine. You can pick either one.
Josie: I will Skirmish.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky.
Josie: But I’ve got 3d6 in Skirmish, so I’m pretty all right… except I’m not, because I rolled a 3.
Rhi: Oof.
Minna: We’re not good at gunfights. We need to stop getting in gunfights.
Rhi: [laughs] I’m gonna say it’s reduced effect. You’re so busy getting Myra clear and trying to keep yourself in cover that you take a wild shot. Some of it hits them, but it’s not really enough to slow them down.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: They’re still very much coming. Blaire, I think that you are probably able to hear the shooting that has started. It is up to you.
Kim: Okay. Have I found anything in the meantime, or no?
Rhi: Go ahead and make some kind of roll for your searching of this place to see if you found anything.
Kim: I’m feeling Survey. I’m gonna try that.
Rhi: Yeah. That makes sense.
Kim: I got a 5.
Rhi: You are just tearing through this place. Fortunately it’s been mostly cleared out so you’re able to search fairly quickly. There’s entire train cars that are just totally empty. You shove open the door that had been left unlocked and as you do so your hand catches on some rusted metal and you cut your hand, so it’s level 1 harm, and this looks like it’s another entry way space where there’s some barricade type things where it looks like a security setup would have been, and there’s another door on the opposite side of this little entry way, and there is carved with what looks like a knife into the metal “HB, boss.”
Minna: [smiling] Succinct.
Rhi: Well, you know, they were thugs, they were bravos. This is also giving you a little bit of insight into Brogan’s history if he was originally operating out of the rail yards in Coalridge.
Kim: I need to get back to the group.
Rhi: Yeah. You note this location, you know how to get back here, but you’re gonna try to run up and rejoin the others?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. You take off to catch up to the rest of the group. Rest of the group… [laughs] You have ducked around a corner for cover, but there are still several people coming. Myra is pretty badly hurt.
Josie: I want to try and get her back around to the entrance. I don’t want to stand and fight.
Minna (as Myra): Box ourselves in and let them come after us?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, but I mean, we won’t have to deal with them out in the open with all their numbers that way.
Minna (as Myra): So you think we can funnel them, take them down one by one?
Josie (as Minx): Exactly.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. You’re gonna have to help me.
Josie (as Minx): No issue, dear.
Rhi: The two of you hustle for the ladder. I’m imagining that Minx has an arm around Myra to help her limp along.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Aw.
Rhi: Myra, you are gonna have to make probably a Prowl roll to get up this ladder.
Josie: But I am assisting you.
Minna: Oh good.
Rhi: You’re at -1 die on this roll because of your injury, but you get that one die back because Minx is helping.
Minna: Phew. It’s a 4.
Rhi: Okay. The two of you climb back up, but when you get back to that little hatch it sticks and it won’t close, so now it’s very obvious where you went in.
Josie: Ick. All right. I’m not gonna stick around to fix it, so we should try to get further in.
Rhi: Okay. Minx and Myra, you guys run into Blaire as Blaire is coming back in your direction.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well they know we’re here now.
Minna (as Myra): Did you find anything?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh—What happened to you?!
Minna (as Myra): Ran into an old friend. Let’s get further back into the car. Anything useful back there?
Kim (as Blaire): I did, but come on, let’s move.
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi: Blaire, you’re able to lead them back down to the office that you found. The door into Harvale’s office has another one of those newer locks, and this door is locked, and your lock picks are busted.
Josie: I have a blunderbuss.
Rhi: You gonna try and Wreck it?
Kim: Go for it.
Josie: Yeah, I guess I’m gonna try and Wreck it, with my no dots in that. What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Myra’s left a trail of blood that’s gonna lead them right to you.
Kim: Once we’re in we can probably try and bar the door.
Josie: Yeah. They’re gonna know where we’re at anyway, so I’ll take that bargain. Six!
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: [laughs] So, Minx, you just take aim and just shoot the lock clean off.
Josie: Boom!
Rhi: I think it’s enough that the door actually swings inward a little bit. There isn’t much left in this office like the rest of this base. It seems to have been stripped pretty bare. The back half of this office is elevated up by about six inches, there’s a couple steps you have to go up to get to that area, and based on the scuff marks and things you’re guessing that’s probably where a desk was at one point. Looking at the floor there you can see that set into the floor there’s a safe. It looks like it would have been under the desk.
Josie: All right. We should try to get into that.
Rhi: No lock picks.
Josie: No lock picks. Um… Shoot. Does anyone have acid to burn through with, or…?
Minna: [laughs] Last time Myra had acid she burned herself.
Josie: [smiling] I know, but we can try again.
Kim: I can have acid. What would that be?
Rhi: We’ve put it as part of demolition tools in the past.
Kim: Okay. Let me just mark that…
Josie: I’m gonna keep watch and keep cover, perhaps bar the door in the meantime.
Kim: What would I be rolling for this?
Rhi: I think last time we did an acid thing I allowed Finesse, or you could do Wreck depending on what you have.
Kim: I’m gonna do Finesse.
Minna: There are ripping sounds as Myra’s taking bits off her skirt and wrapping them around her leg to stop the bleeding.
Kim: That would be a 2.
Rhi: Okay. You pour the acid onto the safe…
Minna: [grunts]
Rhi: …and it works. It starts eating through the metal. It’s actually working surprisingly well…
Minna: No! Is it working too well?
Rhi: …and the acid is starting to drip down, and you can hear some stuff inside this thing starting to sizzle.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh no. Oh no! Oh no-no-no. Guys!
Josie (as Minx): What’s wrong, dear?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… Acid~!
Minna (as Myra): W-What? How can we help you?
Kim (as Blaire): I-I don’t know! How do I get it to stop? I didn’t bring any bases with me.
Minna: [pained] I don’t know. You know more about this than I do.
Kim (as Blaire): No- I- Uh…
Minna (as Myra): Okay. Okay. Just wrap something around your hand and try to get the thing off.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?!
Josie (as Minx): Wrap it nice and tight, nice and thick.
Kim (as Blaire): I- Ugh. I don’t have anything!
Josie: Minx is also gonna be down a sleeve or two at this point, just rip, rip. I’m dressing down. I don’t care about this outfit.
Kim (as Blaire): [groans]
Kim: Okay. She’s gonna cover her hands with it.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Okay… Mmm—Okay!
Kim: And she’s gonna reach in.
Rhi: Yeah. You’ll need to make a roll.
Kim: What do you think, Finesse again?
Rhi: I think you could try and do Finesse, because you’re trying to do this very carefully. Do you want to push yourself or anything?
Kim: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Hmm. The evidence is going to be somewhat damaged no matter what.
Kim: I’ll take it. Three.
Rhi: Uhh-kay. Um… Yeah. I think you reach in there and grab around but you just aren’t able to grab anything.
Minna: Can I try?
Rhi: Yes. Myra, you’re welcome to try.
Minna: I think what happens is Myra crawls across the floor, has been crawling across the floor to help Blaire and she finally gently pushes Blaire’s hands aside. Fuck me… I got a 3. I got two 3s, in fact.
Josie: God damn it.
Minna: You know what, we can scrape something out of this.
Rhi: Okay, so… I think I have mentioned it, but I will perhaps remind you that you can resist any consequence, not just harm.
Minna: Oh shit! I forgot about that.
Josie: Oh! Neat.
Minna: Can I resist the evidence being destroyed?
Rhi: Yeah, because that’s definitely gonna happen.
Minna: Would that be Prowess?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I got a 4, so I’m marking 2 stress.
Rhi: Yeah, you’ll take 2 stress, but you manage to pull it out. It’s something that you probably haven’t seen a lot of before. This is a fairly new technology, photography. It’s just starting to enter the general public. In here is a photograph. It is of a man in his late 30s, early 40s, Akorosian, light skin, dark hair, big bushy mustache, sober faced staring directly at the camera. Overlaid on that image is… Myra—All of you have looked into the ghost field before, so Myra and Blaire as you’re looking at this it’s a very disconcerting feeling to see the color of the ghost field overlaid on this image. Normally you don’t see these colors and mists unless you are deliberately attuning.
Josie: Even though it’s going to be in black and white?
Rhi: Yeah. Well, most of the photograph is in black and white, but then there’s this sort of… What color do we think it is if you look into the ghost field? I’ve been picturing it as green or blue.
Josie: I’ve been picturing blue.
Minna: Yeah, blue, like light blue.
Kim: I’ve been picturing it like greens and blues and whites.
Minna: I picture it as photographic negatives, maybe slightly tinted with blue.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It has this weird blueish tint overlaid on it, and then overlaying the man is another face. It’s another man, darker skin, hard to pin down exactly where they’re from, could be Severos, could be Iruvia. They’re also staring straight ahead towards the camera. There’s a look of curiosity to their face.
Josie (as Minx): Do we have it, dears?
Minna (as Myra): Yes, we have it.
Rhi: The edges are a little bit spattered with acid, but the central part is clear.
Minna (as Myra): Why don’t one of you carry it?
Josie (as Minx): I’ll carry it if you wish.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, you take a look at this photograph and it’s unsettling. [laughs]
Josie: Yep! Especially for me, so I’m not gonna look at it, I’m just gonna keep it.
Rhi: [laughs] You got the thing! Good job.
Josie: Yes. Now, they were trying to bash their way in from the exterior…
Rhi: But they saw where you climbed up, so you can hear footsteps stomping overhead.
Josie: I know, but I imagine it might be apparent from the inside where they were attempting to do this.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: I suggest we try to do the same but from this side.
Rhi: Yeah. You can give that a shot.
Josie: Yes, let’s head down.
Rhi: Peeking into rooms you can see where the wall is dented inward from where they were trying to break through.
Josie: Did we see what they were using?
Rhi: They had a handheld battering ram that they dropped outside. Blaire did bring demolition tools, which is not limited to just the acid, you can have other explosives.
Josie: Yes, let’s explode it, because that always goes well for us.
Kim: Let’s do it. What would I be rolling, Wreck?
Rhi: Yeah. If you want to do this as a group action or… anything.
Kim: A group action would be good.
Josie: Although none of us have dots in Wreck, so we’d all have to push ourselves on a group action.
Kim: Not necessarily. If all three of us roll that’s three chances.
Josie: I got a 1.
Kim: I got a 4.
Minna: I got a 1.
Josie: All right, well we got a 4.
Rhi: Whoever was leading takes 2 stress. The consequence is that the blast works, it blows out the side of this train car, but the cars overhead start collapsing downward.
Josie: Oh God.
Rhi: Everybody’s gonna have to make some kind of roll to get out before… It’s probably gonna be Prowl, which Myra is at a -1 on.
Minna: Oh, so I’m at no dice. [laughs] Oh, fuck yes! I rolled two 5s.
Josie: All right then. I got a 1.
Kim: I got a 3.
Rhi: Okay, so… Oh God. I think what happens is Minx and Blaire both grab Myra and shove her out because she’s hurt.
Others: Aww.
Rhi: Myra makes it out okay, but I think the collective complication for everyone is that the thing caves in, and—
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: Not entirely, they’re not crushed, but Blaire and Minx are stuck and are gonna have to find another way out.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: Fortunately, based on the yelling that you hear above you, it sounds like that destabilized things upstairs as well, but yeah, you’re gonna have to find an alternate exit.
Kim (as Blaire): You got any ideas?
Josie (as Minx): They can’t have had that one entrance/exit. They must have had some way to bail out should things go wrong.
Kim: Would looking into the ghost field reveal anything to me as far as exits go, or no?
Rhi: Yeah, you could try it.
Kim: I would like to. Let me roll Attune, because I am good at one thing. I am not good at one thing.
Josie: Agh.
Kim: Three. That’s fine though.
Rhi: This is just another “you lose this opportunity” like the last time. You look into the ghost field and you don’t see any sort of lingering ghost doors.
Josie: What other rooms are down here on this floor?
Rhi: It’s hard to tell what any of them used to be because they’ve all been stripped bare, but there are a number of other rooms and stuff. A lot of the walls are now damaged what with the collapse, so searching around you might be able to just find a place you can crawl out but you’re gonna have to do some looking.
Josie: I’m gonna Survey to do that.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Fuck!
Rhi: Guys. [laughs]
Minna: Can I do a Survey from the outside?
Rhi: [exasperated] Yeah.
Minna: Well… [laughs] A 1.
Rhi: Oh my God.
Kim: What is going on?
Minna: Okay. Let’s resolve these.
Rhi: So both of you are unable to find anything initially. You can either withdraw and try a different approach or you can continue by seizing a risky opportunity.
Josie: I’m gonna seize a risky opportunity.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: God damn it! Fuck me. That’s a 1.
Kim: Let me roll Survey. Let me try something… One! What the fuck?!
Rhi: Oh my God!
Minna: [laughs] Okay, I’m gonna take a long step back and do a Study, do a good Study, good hard study, look systematically over all of the windows and possible doors and joints. Fuck yes, I got a 6.
Rhi: [relieved] Okay. Myra, you limp around circling and you are able to find a spot where there was a door on one of the train cars that had been welded shut that under the pressure the welding has snapped and it’s opened up, it’s buckled open a hole.
Minna (as Myra): Minx! Blaire! Down here!
Josie (as Minx): all right, dears. Let’s go.
Kim (as Blaire): Where are you?!
Minna (as Myra): Follow my voice!
Kim (as Blaire): Okay!
Rhi: Yeah. The two of you are able to find your way to where Myra is and clamber out and stagger away as this pile of train cars keeps creaking ominously behind you… but you are able to make it away.
Josie: Hurray.
Rhi: Let’s go into our downtime scenes.
## Downtime [1:17:30]
Josie: Okay. Minx is practicing with her sword. She’s hacking at something, and she looks down at it and says:
Josie (as Minx): No, this won’t do.
Josie: And then just takes up increasingly vulgar weapons to beat at it with, and then eventually just sort of says:
Josie (as Minx): Ah, fuck it.
Josie: Lets down her hair and punches the crap out of it for a little while.
Rhi: [laughs] At some point in there she’s definitely got a board with nails sticking out of it.
Josie: Yup. [laughs]
Rhi: All right. Yeah. Just sort of training and getting back to her roots.
Josie: Right. [laughs] Exactly.
Rhi: Myra?
Minna: I think what happens is she knocks on Minx’s door.
Josie (as Minx): Hmm? Yes dear?
Minna (as Myra): Hey. I need to make an outing, but I’m not really in good shape to defend myself if anybody comes after me, which is not an odd proposition at this point. Do you mind, just, like stand outside and keep watch?
Josie (as Minx): I would not mind that at all. In fact, I’ve been practicing.
Minna (as Myra): [breathes] Yeah, I just…
Josie (as Minx): I’ll accompany you.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi: You’re heading to The Devil’s Tooth?
Minna: Yeah, and I think outside the door of the room she usually takes she says:
Minna (as Myra): Don’t… come in?
Josie (as Minx): Of course not, dear.
Minna (as Myra): Thanks.
Josie: I think Minx is just gonna chill out there with maybe a book or something.
Minna: I think that’s it, just having to lean on your teammates. Yay.
Josie: Yay, feelings.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s good. I think while Minx and Myra are out at The Devil’s Tooth, Blaire, you’re on your way back from visiting Seeks to get your hand bandaged up and Seeks mostly was fussing about you getting some kind of horrible diseases because you cut your hand on rusty metal.
Kim: Eh.
Rhi: There’s some kind of kelp paste smeared on your hand and you’re all wrapped up with bandages.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You’re walking home and as you’re making your way through the streets you hear a somewhat familiar voice say from behind you:
Rhi (as ???): Oh, there you are.
Rhi: You turn, and Nyryx is standing there.
Kim (as Blaire): Nyryx!
Josie: Oh no.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi~
Rhi: She’s dressed… When you’ve seen her, Nyryx is usually wearing fairly nice clothes. She’s just wearing sturdy boots and pants and kind of a bulky sweater, kind of a fisherman sweater type thing.
Kim: Cute.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Um… I think Neera told you that…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. She did.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, would you like to meet some people?
Kim (as Blaire): Right now?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, this is kind of when I’m available, and I’m not—
BLAIRE: I mean yeah, yeah, for sure.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yeah. It’s up this way.
Rhi: The two of you start walking, heading into Crow’s Foot. She seems kind of nervous, which again when you’ve seen her previously she’s been pretty smooth and calm and collected.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah. She’s acting very unusual from what you’ve seen of Nyryx previously.
Kim (as Blaire): Is everything okay? You good?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Y-Yes. I’m sorry. I don’t… Do you know much about my, um, situation?
Kim (as Blaire): Your situation… No. No, I barely know you. Sorry.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Heh. It’s all right. I just wasn’t sure how much Neera had told you. Minx has told you a bit about where we grew up, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Um… Not much, no.
Rhi (as Nyryx): From Coalridge, me and Minx and Bazso didn’t really have much, but we had each other. Well, I’d like to say that we made it as far as we did because we were clever and fast, but I think a lot of it was just luck and the fact that none of us were facing it alone. So we got out, but a lot of people don’t…
Rhi: As she finishes that sentence and moves into the next, something just shifts in her face and in her eyes. There’s a weird light behind her eyes that you recognize as the look of somebody who is possessed. It’s still Nyryx’s body, it’s still Nyryx’s voice, but you’re talking to somebody else.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I was 16 I think, it’s hard to keep track in a place like that. The days all sort of run together into hunger and pain and misery. I didn’t make it out, and you Blaire, I don’t even know if you remember. There were some spirit traffickers looking for those of us who had died in the coal heaps, and you got there first, you found me and helped me get away. I found someone that understood what I was and understood that I wasn’t going to lose myself the way that most spirits do, and Nyryx was generous enough to let me stay, to let me see what life is like when it’s not just pain.
Josie & Minna: [whimpers]
Kim: Blaire’s not even gonna say anything. She’s just gonna throw her arms around Nyryx.
Others: Aww.
Rhi: [laughs] She kind of stumbles a little bit and doesn’t react right away, because that’s not at all what she was expecting. After a second she tentatively returns the hug. After a minute she steps back and when she steps back that possessor look has faded and Nyryx gives you a little hesitant smile.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Um, well, I’m glad you understand. Heh.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I should be thanking you.
Kim (as Blaire): No. What you’re doing is really good. You’re giving someone half way, about half way, a life that they should have deserved. That’s a lot. Not a lot of people in Duskwall would do that.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I just… It could have been me, you know? It could have been Minx.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah…
Rhi (as Nyryx): Uh… about Minx. She doesn’t… know.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I haven’t figured out a way to tell her.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. That’s between you and her. I won’t get between that. I understand.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Okay. Thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): I know, not too many people would be as understanding. I get it.
Rhi: She leads you up through Crow’s Foot to a tavern hotel type setup and doesn’t lead you inside but takes you around the back and down into the basement. As she’s opening up the door, she’s like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): All right. Well, um, welcome to The Reconciled, I suppose.
Rhi: And we’ll pick up on that scene next time, on how that plays out.
Kim & Josie: [play shouting]
Josie: So much feels.
Rhi: Yay! I’ve been wanting to do that scene for a while. So, eventually the three of you come back together having taken care of your wounds, both physical and mental. Who is writing the letter?
Josie: I am taking care of the penmanship at the very least.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: It will open “Dear Chief Inspector and tenant, You may be pleased to know that one Mr. Brogan has been liberated of certain evidence of indiscretion. You may also wish to know that we have come into possession of similar items. But never fear, as a token of our good will, we give to you the information that Harvale Brogan is the mastermind behind the assassination of a certain ambassador of our fair city. Now, I am certain you have the acumen of your position to follow up on this information as you choose, and simply keep us in mind.” And I’m not gonna sign it.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. In just about two weeks the Magpies will be celebrating our one year anniversary. I’ll have more to say about that next episode, but we do have some exciting plans for celebrating! For our Patrons backing us at $2 or more, we’ll be releasing a brand new bonus episode, in which the Magpies have a chat with a very inquisitive reporter. And, Patrons supporting us at $15 dollars or more, will get to join us for our first live hangout stream. We’ll answer questions, play some games, and just have a fun time celebrating our one year anniversary. So, if you’d like to join in on any of the fun, head to patreon.com/magpiespodcast.
We have another transcript available on the site. Season one, episode five, is now available. And before you ask, yes, we’ve skipped from episode three to episode five. The transcript for episode four is in progress and should be up soon.
A note and content warning for today’s episode; this episode returns to the Blaire and Setarra subplot, which in this episode includes a lot of Setarra being a horrible, emotionally abusive person.
## Setarra first appears at [00:47:00]
This plot is interwoven throughout the whole episode, which means I can’t give you a timestamp area to skip through. For those of you who need to skip the episode entirely, there is a text summary of the episode on the website so you can skip this one without missing out on the plot. The summary is in the episode post on our website: magpiespodcast.net/. I will include a direct link to that page in the show notes.
Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Kim: McLean Hospital is a psychiatric hospital in Massachusetts that is committed to helping adults, adolescents and their families struggling with mental illness and addiction. And, on a personal note, it was their inpatient program that I attended when I was in crisis back in the fall of 2017. The people on the staff at McLean are so incredibly compassionate and respectful of everyone who comes through their doors, and I feel so lucky that I was able to receive their quality care. If you’d like to donate, visit them at: givemclean.partners.org.
Rhi: For our American listeners, please continue to visit 5calls.org and contact your representatives. While the 2020 presidential election campaign has already kicked off, there are still plenty of issues that need attention here and now.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story continues [00:02:47]
It’s been about a week and a half since your last score, when you broke into the old Umbra Hunters’ base and the railyards and obtained some blackmail information. You sent a note to Chief Inspector Severin informing him what you would like his next steps to be in terms of dealing with Brogan, but nothing seems to have happened so far. Brogan is continuing to operate in the Centuralia Club as far as you know, there haven’t been any reports of his arrest. So the three of you have been starting to try to figure out what to do next.
Also, in this time, an old friend of yours Nessa Ericks, the artist who you helped out when she was being exploited for her talents by a nobleman, she contacted you a few days ago saying that she finally wants to take you up on the offer that you had made of helping her out with her paintings. So the three of you plus Nessa are sitting at your table in The Hound’s Paw and we kind of come in as Nessa is finishing up her story of why she’s reached out to you. And she says:
Rhi (as Nessa): Yeah, so, um, just with my old fence in Ironhook, it’s been really hard to move anything lately. I have a lot of paintings just kinda piling up in the apartment and, well, y’know I’ve got my mom and my brothers that need taking care of so I just, I remember that you had made that offer of being able to help out, so uh, I’m hoping it’s still good.
Josie (as Minx): Of course it is dear, we’d love to. In fact, one might say you may have inspired me a little bit, I’ve been moving some paintings of my own.
Rhi (as Nessa): Oh!
Josie (as Minx): Not making them, obviously, but—
Rhi (as Nessa): Oh.
Josie (as Minx): I’m not quite that talented.
[laughter]
Rhi (as Nessa): Okay, so, okay, that would be great. I mean, I could just pass you some of the pieces – most of what I’ve been doing lately, I mean, I’ve been doing some of my own, original pieces but those don’t always sell as well but for the other pieces I’ve been just sort of imitating some of the older artists styles so it’s not replicating a piece exactly, because that can get suspicious and caught out pretty easily—
Josie (as Minx): But it’s continuing the tradition.
Rhi (as Nessa): Yes, it’s… an homage that nobody knows is an homage.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Sneaky!
Rhi: So, Nessa’s like:
Rhi (as Nessa): Okay, um, what’s gonna be the best way for me to get you the pieces, then? Should I just bring them here, do you wanna come to me?
Josie (as Minx): Well, I have a small place not too far from here that I store some pieces in.
Rhi (as Nessa): Oh, okay.
Josie (as Minx): Bring them there, it should be sufficient.
Rhi (as Nessa): Perfect! This’ll help out a lot.
Josie: Also, I just totally ad hoc’d that because it made sense, but—
Rhi: Yeah, I think you have the Something on the Side special ability, it totally makes sense that that’s your side gig.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi (as Nessa): Yeah, this’ll help out a lot and if I can bring in enough money, maybe ++ Kayden ++ will stop talking up with the Lampblacks.
Josie (as Minx): Oh yeah we can definitely not have that.
Rhi (as Nessa): Yeah, apparently their leader has been expanding a lot and recruiting people—
Kim (as Blaire): Oh honey, you don’t know the half of it.
Rhi (as Nessa): Uh oh.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh I’m sure Minx could tell you more.
Josie: Alright, we’re passing it off to me, alright.
Josie (as Minx): Alright, we’ll explain that a bit more later but suffice to say the Lampblacks can be cruel, we will try and take care of you.
Rhi (as Nessa): Well, I appreciate it.
Rhi: And I assume, Minx, you give her the address for your place.
Rhi (as Nessa): Well my shift at the shop starts in a couple hours so I need to get going, but thank you and I of course, you will get a cut of whatever the painting’s get, and um, yeah, I’m sure this will work out. You all seem a lot more reliable than my my last fence.
[Josie, as Minx, laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Glad to hear it, dearie.
Rhi: Right, and so I think she, gosh, I think she’s a hugger. She’s gonna go and—
[general awws]
Rhi: —give hugs to people. If people don’t want hugs…
Josie: Oh yeah, Minx definitely grabs a hug.
Rhi: Okay. Is Myra cool with a hug?
Minna: Yeah, she’s okay with a hug.
Kim (as Blaire): I want a hug!
Rhi: Yes, Blaire also gets a hug. She hugs everyone and then heads out. So, the three of you are left sitting at your table with your half-finished drinks and the newspaper that, I’m going to say Myra, had brought along and rather than it being open up to the front page it’s actually pretty deep into the pages, sort of in local news, or the police blotter section, is a very short article that reads:
“Chief Inspector Severin seeks information about a recent outburst of gang violence in the Old Rail Yard, in Coalridge. The violence culminated in an explosion that lead to significant property damage to the circle of settlements there. Inspector Severin asks that any tenets with evidence relating to this incident send a letter to the north Six Towers’ station house, so he may arrange a meeting.”
Kim (as Blaire): Busted…
Josie (as Minx): It seems he’s seeing an opportunity to get out of this, do you think… Well, what did we leave in our wake besides destruction?
Minna: Ojal saw me, didn’t she? Didn’t we lock eyes at one point?
Rhi: Ojal saw you.
Minna: So I think Myra’s going to tap her fingers on the table.
Minna (as Myra): Somebody recognised me at the job. I don’t know if she would—
Kim (as Blaire): Who?
Minna (as Myra): [sigh] Let’s just say an old friend.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay, no I don’t want to ask, I just—
Minna: Because I don’t think you guys knew that I ran into Clave, did you?
[cross talk agreeing]
Minna: I think it was just Phin who knew.
[agreement]
Josie (as Minx): Would this old friend have reason to sell you out?
Minna (as Myra): Oh yeah, definitely.
Josie (as Minx): Oh yes, they tend to be like that.
Rhi: You all didn’t sign the letter. So the fact that this is just in the paper implies he is trying to reach out to whoever—
Minna: Oh he’s trying to reach out to us, okay.
[Minna laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, he is trying to reach out without knowing who he’s trying to address.
Josie: Oh. Wait, so does that mean we should go and meet him?
Minna (as Myra): Probably?
Rhi: You can’t really just walk into the station house, you being who you are, but he asks that whoever has done this, send a message to arrange a meeting.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay, so we could send one of those, like ransom notes? So he doesn’t… But not a ransom note, you know what I mean. Like, we take—
Josie (as Minx): Cutting out letters?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! So that way they can’t trace our handwriting.
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): That’ll be a fun scrapbooking project.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! I would think so and we send that to the station and we’ll meet at an undisclosed location far away from the station house.
Josie (as Minx): That sounds like a smart idea.
[ Kim (as Blaire) and Minna (as Myra) agree]
Josie (as Minx): And I get to have some fun with typography. That’s a field I haven’t delved into yet.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, so I have some special paper and glue, I’ll get that for you from my room but yeah that’s probably going to be a you project, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I am somewhat glad but I do enjoy sharing these things, will you not be present?
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, I’ve got other stuff to do. I’ve got to take care of… a thing in a place.
Josie (as Minx): This wouldn’t happen to be a certain aquatic friend in a certain aquatic place?
Kim (as Blaire): No, no no, no no no. It’s a different thing.
Josie (as Minx): A different thing.
Kim (as Blaire): A different ghostie thing.
Minna (as Myra): Okay, well I hope it goes well for you.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks!
Rhi: So Blaire, are you gonna head out?
Kim (as Blaire): Yep!
Kim: We’re probably just going to leave some coin on the table to pay her part of the tab for her drink and head out and leave The Hound’s Paw.
Rhi: Okay, are you going to go back to the Nest to grab your stuff and get the things out for Minx first?
Kim: Yeah, yeah. That’s a good point, it’s kept in my room it’s not in a common area so I have to get that for her first.
Rhi: Yeah, so you start heading back and as you are hurrying through the streets, we fade out and fade back in, picking up on a scene from last time. We see Nyryx who had caught up with Blaire and told her about the Reconciled, opening up a cellar door to lead Blaire down into the basement underneath and in. And Blaire, you follow her down the stairs. There’s a couple of electroplasmic lights on the wall. She gets to the door at the end of this little stairs and hallway. She knocks out a very specific beat, and there’s a pause and the door opens and there is an older woman standing there, looks like she’s probably in her fifties, heavy-set, very very good looking, she’s got dark hair with streaks of grey in it. She’s very fashionably dressed, really elegant gown. This is clearly somebody who has money and taste. She opens it up and looks down at Nyryx and is like:
Rhi (as woman): Ah, it is good to see you again child. Did you bring?
Rhi: And she kind of looks past Nyryx and sees Blaire and the warm smile that she had when she was talking to Nyryx fades a little and she’s like:
Rhi (as woman): Ah, good. You were able to find her.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi!
Rhi (as woman): Blaire Culhane?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Kim: She holds out a hand to shake.
Rhi: The woman shakes your hand, says:
Rhi (as Woman): You may call me Lady Karina. We have, taken some interest in you work and would like to speak with you.
Rhi: She steps back into this room, Nyryx kind of holds the door and gestures for you to go in.
Kim: Okay. I follow.
Rhi: So the little basement hallway was kind of dark and narrow and the bulbs were sort of those bare bulbs, hanging, it looked a little creepy. Inside this room is really, really nice. There’s polished hardwood floors, a couple rugs, some really finely crafted stained glass sconces on the wall, so that the light in here has a sort of reddish-gold tint to it.
Kim: Pretty!
Rhi: There’s a couple paintings on the wall, there’s some very nice furniture. It looks like you went from a creepy basement hall to a nobility’s lounge, basically.
Kim: Dope.
Rhi: In addition to you and Nyryx, there are five people here. All of them are older than you, the youngest is probably in their mid-thirties.
Kim: Most people are older than me.
Rhi: All of them are dressed very nicely. A few of them are in just fine clothing like what nobility would wear. One is in the uniform of the Imperial military.
Kim: What? Whoa. Whoa, what?
Rhi: I’m going to guess that Blaire, you’re probably not familiar enough with the ranks of the military to be able to recognise on sight?
Kim: No.
Rhi: But you know that more bars means higher rank, and this guy has a few.
Kim: Oh boy. I am brushing shoulders with some people. Yikes.
[Rhi laughs]
Kim: Okay so I guess I am going in.
Rhi: Lady Karina looks you up and down and is like:
Rhi (as Lady Karina): You are much younger than we had anticipated for the amount of trouble that you’ve caused.
Kim (as Blaire): What age were you anticipating?
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Well, I’m not really sure. Truth be told, I’ve started to have a little bit of difficulty distinguishing the ages of the living, but I can tell you are quite young.
Kim (as Blaire): 19, yeah.
Rhi: The guy in the military uniform kind of chokes a little bit. I think you just hear:
Rhi (as military man): She’s a child!
Rhi: And then the person that is standing next to him is like:
Rhi (as voice): She’s clearly very capable, just see where this goes.
Kim: Just let the teens run the world, jeez.
[Rhi laughs]
Minna: I hate to break it to you, but you’re the only teenager.
Kim: Shhhhh!
[Rhi laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Everybody else is in their twenties.
Kim: Shhhhh!
Rhi: Blaire is a baby.
Kim: I am quite the bab. Anyway.
Rhi: So Lady Karina gestures at one of the chairs, and is like:
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Please, have a seat.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Kim: And she’s gonna take a seat.
Rhi: Some of them sit down. The military guy remains standing. Karina glances past you to Nyryx for a moment and then looks back:
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Did Nyryx tell you much of what our group does? What our group is?
Kim (as Blaire): Not so much what it doesn, but a little bit about what you are. I know that, well, you’re the Reconciled! You’re spirits who have passed on and have retained some of your humanity, which is really great.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): That is true, and yes, we consider ourselves to be very fortunate that we have retained ourselves and our minds. What we do is a bit more complicated and we will get into that with your assistance, I hope, in the future but, as you can imagine, our group is a rather fragile one. If anyone were to discover our existence and our identities, the Spirit Wardens would crush us as best they could.
Kim (as Blaire): I know. Yeah, it’s scary.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): I’m pleased that you understand. However, before we can fully involve you in our work, we need to know that you are trustworthy.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): You have shown an open-mindedness for spirits.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you!
Rhi (as Lady Karina): We fear, perhaps, a bit too open-minded.
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean?
Rhi (as Lady Karina): The spirits that roam Duskwall, most of them are not like us. You know this.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, I’ve dealt with them.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Yes. We are aware of your dealings with them and that is the cause for our concern.
Rhi: The military guy kind of folds his arms and huffs a little bit.
Kim (as Blaire): But, why?
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Feral spirits are dangerous. They prey upon anything with life essence, and that can at times include us and any among the living that we may have concerns for. You have demonstrated a rather troubling habit of letting these feral spirits go free.
Kim (as Blaire): Into the Deathlands!
Rhi (as Lady Karina): And into the city.
Kim (as Blaire): I- I try not to, most of the time, I try to let them outside.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): We know. And we appreciate this. However, there have been several incidents that we have heard of; a spirit running off with a cultist’s body, a group of spirits lead by one that bears a sword, some others. But most concerning to us are the spirits that escaped from the incident at the Docks a few months ago.
Kim (as Blaire): They – a lot of them didn’t want to go into the Deadlands.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Well, with the sheer number that were there, it would have been difficult for any one person to take them all anyway.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, not all at once, no, but given the chance I could have done it!
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Well… you’re going to have a chance to rectify, at least, some of this. Many of the ghosts that were involved in the outbreak at the Docks have escaped, some have been dealt with by the Spirit Wardens, some we have lost track of. We have recently learnt that a number of them have remained at the docks, the site of their death. And when a large number of spirits congregated together like that, fixated on the same point of anger and vengeance, a truly terrible thing begins to happen. Are you familiar with a Harvester, Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, I’ve… I’ve seen one.
Rhi: She actually looks a little surprised at that.
[Josie and Kim laugh]
Rhi (as Lady Karina): I see. Well, then you understand the threat that they pose.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): We have reason to believe that this congregation of spirits under the Docks is beginning to form into a Harvester.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Yes. It is fortunately not a fast process, but it has also been two months since those spirits passed on. It has progressed somewhat. It is not a full Harvester yet. There are still individual spirits that can be dealt with. And that is what we need you to do. You need to seek out this congregation, destroy or capture the spirits and any that are captured, return to us.
Kim (as Blaire): If I return them to you, do you think you could help them?
Rhi (as Lady Karina): They will be taken care of.
Kim (as Blaire): What does that mean? By your terms. Because, I’m sorry, but I’m not going to destroy them. If there’s a way we can help them—
Rhi (as Lady Karina): There isn’t, Blaire. You either retain your mind or you don’t.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, so…
Rhi (as Lady Karina): If you would prefer to take the risk of taking them to the Deathlands, you may do so. But we will need confirmation you have done so. We need to know that this problem has been dealt with. If you do this then you will have shown responsibility and trustworthiness and we can begin to share with you the work that we do protecting other spirits like ourselves.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Okay, I can do that.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Good.
Rhi: And I think at this point she kind of glances behind you again and Nyryx puts her hand on your shoulder. Karina says:
Rhi (as Lady Karina): I wish you the best of luck and hopefully we will see you back here soon.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, likewise.
Rhi: Nyryx kind of escorts you out.
Kim (as Blaire): That could have gone a little better.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Probably not, actually.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t think so?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, they’re… not the most… like you said, you understand why they have to keep it a secret, they’re not the most trusting or welcoming group.
Kim (as Blaire): No, absolutely.
Rhi (as Nyryx): It took me a while to even find out about them, much less to get them to trust me at all.
Kim (as Blaire): I just feel bad about it. I, like, started all this with the Docks and the Harvester growing there, and…
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well…
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think they would have destroyed them, if I brought them to them?
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t know.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, gosh, I don’t know. Because, like… If it really is going to become a Harvester and nothing is going to stop that, is it better to destroy it? Because letting it out into the Deathlands won’t stop that from keeping it growing?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well… I don’t know. It kind of depends on- maybe if you can split it up?
Kim (as Blaire): That’s what I’ve been thinking. But I don’t know how to do that, I was hoping they would know.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I think maybe that’s part of the test? I don’t really, I mean, aside from—
Rhi: Nyryx kind of gestures at herself.
Rhi (as Nyryx): —my, uh, roomate?
[Kim, as Blaire, laughs]
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t really know a lot about spirits. And as long as she’s with me, I don’t really have to. You can really only hold one at a time as person.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, I know that.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Anyway, I need to head back.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, you go do your thing.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Uh, good luck and, um—
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks.
Rhi (as Nyryx): If there’s anything that I can help with, let me know?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, yeah, but I’ll try not to bother you.
[Rhi, as Nyryx, chuckles]
Rhi (as Nyryx): Alright. Um, I’ll see you around, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Thanks Nyryx.
Rhi: The scene fades back on Blaire, leaving the Nest with a pack full of supplies and books and heads further up into Six Towers.
Rhi: Back to Minx and Myra, who were left at the Hound’s Paw. What did the two of you get up to?
Josie: I’m going scrapbooking!
[laughter]
Rhi: So Minx will craft a letter. What does your response say?
Josie: I’m going to say, basically in the most sarcastic way possible, that we have ‘evidence’, I would like to meet… ooh…
Minna: I’m somewhere on the edge of between Six Towers and Nightmarket?
Josie: Sure, that way if shit goes to hell we can run either direction!
Rhi: You probably, knowing that this is not just an inspector but a fairly highly-ranked one, you probably don’t want to actually meet in a public place where any of you might be recognised. There’s probably an abandoned dock, down in the canals, as it used to be kind of a gondola stopping point that’s closed now.
Josie & Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: How does that sound for a meeting spot?
Josie: That sounds good. Also, I don’t know if Myra’s going to take these measures, but Minx is gonna be sure to wear like a veil, like a fashionable veil.
Rhi: Ooh.
Minna: Ooh yeah, what are we doing for disguises?
Josie: You know what, a veil and a fan.
[Rhi and Minna laugh and approve]
Josie: So she can go:
[Josie imitates the sound of opening a fan to hide her face]
Rhi: Minx is going all out.
Minna: I was just wondering if there’s like any groups in the area that do do veils or face coverings? Maybe The Weeping Lady? I don’t know.
Rhi: And yeah, we can say that some followers of The Weeping Lady have more face-concealing robes and veils.
Minna: Yeah, so I think Myra’s going to do that.
Rhi: Okay, so the two of you, at the time that you had arranged for, head down there. I imagine the two of you get there pretty early? Make sure you’re the first ones there?
Minna & Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, about ten minutes before the appointed time, you hear boots clicking on the stairs and the man that you saw in that photograph comes down the stairs. He’s, like I said, an Akorosian man, pale skin, dark hair, big moustache, Inspector’s uniform – which is similar to the Bluecoats’ uniform, but a little more brass detailing on it. The Inspector’s uniform always just look cleaner, they’re specifically tailored to the person wearing it, the Bluecoats just get whatever. And he comes down the stairs, looks at the two of you, and he raises an eyebrow and is like:
Rhi (as Chief Inspector Severin): Well, I suppose I can’t fault you for paranoia.
[Josie, as Minx, laughs]
Josie (as Minx): It’s a matter of course in our trade, you understand.
Rhi (as Chief Inspector Severin): Yeah, my new… blackmailers, I assume?
Josie (as Minx): Quite. Although, that is a rather crass word for it.
Rhi (as Chief Inspector Severin): Well. Accurate.
Rhi: So he folds his arms and is like:
Rhi (as Chief Inspector Severin): So, you want me to take down Brogan, yes?
Josie (as Minx): Quite. Is there some obstacle to this?
Rhi (as Chief Inspector Severin): Yes, or I would have done it already. That scum has been holding me hostage for years. The problem is the rest of his little group of friends. He and that club of his bankrolls the whole operation- well, not the whole operation, from what I understand, they’re all pretty rich, but he’s the main moneylender.
Josie (as Minx): Quite.
Rhi (as Chief Inspector Severin): So, I arrest him, bring him up on charges, and those charges get dismissed. And I probably lose my job which I would rather not have happen I’ve actually been doing some good with this body.
Josie (as Minx): Apologies, I wasn’t entirely certain who we were speaking to.
[Rhi, as Severin, laughs]
Rhi (as Chief Inspector Severin): Oh no, Gilbert has not been in charge here for a good long while, not since he killed me.
Josie (as Minx): Ah.
Rhi (as the spirit inside Chief Inspector Severin): He and his squad broke into my home looking for a stash of drugs I didn’t have—
Josie (as Minx): I do believe you. I don’t think we are here for your unlife story.
Rhi (as the spirit): Alright, fair enough. In any case, outside of the Brogan thing, I feel like I’ve been doing pretty good, better than he would have done, and I would like to keep my position.
Josie (as Minx): We would not deign to have you lose it, but also you are certain that if he is taken into custody, they will not simply abandon the weakest of the herd?
Rhi (as the spirit): No, not if they have a reason to protect him still, and right now his money is buying him an awful lot of protection.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Minna (as Myra): Even if they find out he sold out his old mates?
Rhi (as the spirit): Ehh, I’m pretty sure they already know about that. But, if you could come up with something to show that a devilfish doesn’t change its spots, if you had some sort of evidence – real or not – demonstrating that he has once again crossed his teammates—
Minna (as Myra): Do you have anything in his handwriting?
Rhi (as the spirit): I might. I’ll have to dig back through my papers. Your biggest concern here is Lady Drake. She’s a magistrate and a member of the circle. If you want him to actually get convicted, you’re going to have to make sure that she lets that happen. Otherwise, I arrest him, I charge him, his case ends up in her docket, she dismisses the charges.
Rhi: Actually, you recognise that name. It was the name mentioned by the guards at Ironhook. She is the one that tipped them off about the fact that you all were coming to break out Phin.
Minna (as Myra): She’s a problem.
Josie (as Minx): Though people in her position do not take kindly to a personal betrayal.
Rhi (as the spirit): No. Based on, at least what Brogan said, he complained about her a little bit. I get the feeling that they don’t like each other very much.
Josie (as Minx): Well, then it seems like the situation is perhaps tailor-made then.
Rhi (as the spirit): Well you are all going to have to come up with some reason for them to turn on him.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, that should not be too difficult to concoct, although it will expend resources that will need compensation.
Rhi: He raises an eyebrow again and is like:
Rhi (as the spirit): Right, well you clear the way for the arrest and then we’ll talk.
Rhi: He narrows his eyes at the two of you for a second.
Josie (as Minx): I do believe that will be all for this evening. Thank you for your time.
Rhi: For a second the two of you see sort of a blueish glint in his eyes, it’s the same sort of look that people generally get when they’re looking into the ghost field.
Minna: Mm, don’t like that.
Rhi: And he sort of grins, gives you a half bow and is like:
Rhi (as the spirit): Certainly. Tell the other Magpies I said hello.
Rhi: And then he leaves.
Minna (as Myra): Better hope this works out for us.
Josie (as Minx): It will. Also, sorry if I was somewhat taking charge there, we’re blackmailing him, he can’t dictate terms to us.
Minna (as Myra): No, I just… uh, I’m not at my best round his type.
Josie (as Minx): Me either, I must admit. Well spirits of any sort, I feel ill at ease.
Minna (as Myra): I can do spirits, but it’s just not right that – acting like it’s his body? No.
Josie (as Minx): That is truly despicable, and I’m sure that, given the situation, our more spiritually inclined friend might be able to deal with that, after the task is done.
Rhi: Blaire is doing the last bit of her ghostly research – where would you go to do this?
Kim: That’s a good question. Um, is there a library I’m not banned from?
[laughter]
Kim: Because I know I can’t go to Charterhall.
[laughter continues]
Minna: Wait, I can go to Charterhall if you can’t.
Kim: Yeah. Yeah, you can go to my not-so alma mater and I can’t.
Minna: I definitely have access to Morlan Hall’s library.
Kim: Anyway, is there a library I could go to that’s not illegal for me?
[Rhi sighs]
Kim: Is that a no?
Rhi: Well, so, I mean, this is not a setting that has public libraries.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: They’re not that interested in the education of the masses.
Kim: I remember that now. Yeah.
Minna: Maybe you have like a friend who’s a bookseller?
Rhi: Yeah, who are some of your contacts?
Kim: I’m not going to talk to Flint, so that leaves Scurlock, which I don’t think is—
[assorted protests against Scurlock]
Rhi: This Quellyn, a witch, is someone we’ve never—
Kim: I was just going to bring that up. Yeah, who is this Quellyn?
Rhi: I don’t know, you tell me!
Kim: Uh.
Rhi: She can be somebody with books.
Kim: Book witch! Okay.
[laughter]
Kim: And, yeah, she’s basically like a hermit, she lives alone in her house surrounded by a bunch of books.
Rhi: She probably lives in Six Towers.
Kim: Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Rhi: I like the idea that she just lives in this big, decrepit, crumbling mansion that she’s just filled with books and other arcane stuff.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So you, I think you’ve probably been doing some research with Quellyn. So you head up to her mansion, and knock on the door.
Kim (as Blaire): Quellyn?
Rhi: There’s a long pause.
Kim (as Blaire): Quellyn?
Rhi: It’s like a couple minutes.
Kim (as Blaire): Quellyn, are you home?
Rhi: Door creaks open a little bit, and the you see her peering out and she opens it up and is like:
Rhi (as Quellyn): You’re back.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi!
Rhi (as Quellyn): You need the books again?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes please.
Rhi (as Quellyn): Ugh, this better be as important as you say it is.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, it is.
Rhi: She lets you in, and is like:
Rhi (as Quellyn): You know where all the spirit books are, I’m working on something in the kitchen.
Rhi: And as you step inside, there’s a kinda weird smell in the air, it’s kind of like something floral but also like really, really stinky cheese.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: Yeah. She’s like:
Rhi (as Quellyn): Help yourself. Don’t take anything.
Kim (as Blaire): Food-wise? Or book-wise?
Rhi (as Quellyn): Both.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay! I’ll just take notes.
Rhi (as Quellyn): Notes are fine.
Rhi: She wanders off down the hall. This is just kind of how she is, she lets you look at her books but she’s not really social.
Kim: Fair.
Rhi: She’s very distracted, she’s working on some kind of potion.
Kim (as Blaire): Good luck with your potion!
Rhi (as Quellyn): I’ll need it!
[Kim and Rhi laugh]
Rhi: Alright, so go ahead and give me a roll for your gathering info here, and this will be what you have learned in total.
Kim: Okay. I would like to roll Study.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Okay, so my highest was a 4?
Rhi: Okay. So you get a standard amount of information. So you are able to find a tome in here – you’ve been working through it for the last few visits – that has a lot of theories about how Harvesters work, how they are formed, it’s actually written by a Spirit Warden, which you’re a little…
Kim: Mhmm, information could be biased but…
Rhi: Yeah. They are kind of the leading researchers into the occult. They are just looking at it in terms of how to destroy it.
Kim: Yeah, which is fucked.
Rhi: But it does have, because its looking at how to destroy it, it does talk about how to interrupt the formation of a Harvester.
Kim: Oh. Okay.
Rhi: It says that there’s a few ways you can do it, one that has had some success is if you can draw any of the ghosts off with something that is more enticing to them than this sort of ball of rage that they’ve become. It also says that, yeah, you can use electroplasmic power, so like your lightening hooks. That would dissipate the ghosts but it would probably also destroy some of them.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: And… I’m trying to think if there would be anything… Do you have any ideas for what a third option could be?
Kim: Wait, let me think about that for a second. I feel like some kind of incantation or ritual would be too simplistic or accessible. Maybe if you got a hold of maybe some kind of artifact that splits harvesters apart and individualises them? You know what I mean?
Rhi: Maybe it’s… Let me pitch this, maybe it’s not an artifact, maybe it’s a tool that the Spirit Wardens use, so it’s like a electroplasmic disrupter, is what they call it.
Kim: Yeah. And the other thing, them being Spirit Wardens, it’s probably more destructive than it is what I was picturing, do you know what I mean?
Rhi: I think that this thing captures the spirits.
Kim: Oh. Okay.
Rhi: I’m gonna say.
Kim: So, electroplasmic disruptor.
Rhi: Yeah. Is the other option.
Kim: So I guess Blaire just needs to brainstorm about what she can do to entice individual spirits.
Rhi: Well, you’ve got the electroplasm to feed them.
Kim: Right, but she – you’re right, but she’s trying to think of something a little bit more high-baller than that.
Rhi: Yeah. So Blaire is continuing to do her research on what she could potentially use to lure these spirits out to seperate, Minx and Myra, what are you two up to?
Josie: Concocting a scheme.
[Rhi laughs]
Minna: I think we’re going to see if we can get paper from Harvale, from our new, not friend…
Rhi: Contact?
Minna: Our new contact.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Right, right, you wanted some stuff with Harvale’s handwriting on it. Let’s call that a Consort roll?
Minna: I rolled a 3!
[Sympathetic sounds from Josie and Rhi]
Minna: I rolled two 3s, and a 1!
Rhi: Oof!
Minna: The dice hate me!
Rhi: You get a limited amount of information. I think that you arranged for sort of a dead-drop, where he leaves these papers. And he has one and a half pages of handwriting. One is a short-ish letter, just giving him some instructions about ‘Hey, leave this area alone, don’t bother these people, they’re with me’ and the other is the top half of another letter, it looks like it gt ripped in half at some point and he was able to find the top half. So you have some handwriting sample, but its not a ton.
Minna: But I can use them, sort of, to try and do some kind of roll?
Rhi: So I think while you’re doing that, Minx, what kind of info are you looking to gather?
Josie: I guess I’m just want to know more about this Lady Drake person.
Rhi: Okay. Just going to try and do your usual schmoozing with the upper classes?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. What you kind of new about her going in: She’s a magistrate, she oversees trials of criminals, or accused criminals, in Duskwall. She’s known for being very ruthless. And, like most magistrates, you verdict depends more on your social standing and the size of your bank account than any actual evidence.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: That’s not particularly unique to her. That’s how most magistrates operate in the city. She is also known for – she is very intelligent, she is nobility – but she’s not very known for socialising. The people you talk to say she tends not to go to parties. Which a lot of them say is for the best, because when she does show up, she’s kind of a killjoy. Very serious, tends to be very brisk and blunt in her speech. The one thing you do get is that she apparently is a fairly active member of The Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh.
Josie: Hm. Are there any famous or infamous cases she’s judged? I don’t know, I kind of just want intrigue that we can put into whatever note we’re doing.
Rhi: She’s the one who oversaw the trial of the leadership of The Umbra Hunters.
[Minna makes a noise of interest]
Rhi: So, she is the one that put them away.
Josie: Right. And Brogan was the former leader but he sold them out to her?
Rhi: Well, he sold them out, she ended up being in charge of their trial, she and Brogan are now in the super-secret rich people who want power club…
Josie: Right. What happened to The Umbra Hunters? What was their sentence?
Rhi: They were sent to Ironhook and they all were killed in prison.
[Minna exclaims]
Rhi: Yeah, not all at once but over the course of a couple of years.
Josie: See, the thing is he sold them out but I almost wonder if there was like a vengeance narrative we could spin here, from Brogan? Like, said they’d get put away, not all dead, that sort of thing.
[Rhi exclaims]
Rhi: Ooh! Ooh, that’s a good angle!
[Josie laughs]
Josie: And just spin it like he’s working against her because he’s bitter about that?
Rhi: Yeah, you could, you could definitely take that approach. I like that.
Josie: Now it will just be a matter of how to convey that through the resources we have.
Rhi: I mean, yeah, if you’ve got… oh. Oh, I have an idea.
Minna & Kim: Oh no.
Josie: Uh-huh?
Rhi: Okay, so. Your plan at one point was to set it up as though he had hired all of you to kill Avrathi, right? That was what you were going to frame him for?
[Minna and Josie agree]
Rhi: You run with that, and the letters he’s writing to you now are he’s trying to get you to kill Drake. Out of vengeance.
Minna: She’s next.
Rhi: Yeah, that she’s next on his list. He is trying to cull the circle down to the people that he wants to be in it.
Josie: Oh, that’s so good. And Minx can totally compose this letter because this is dramatic and over-the-top and—
[Laughter]
Minna: She’s just dictating to Myra, dramatically pacing around the kitchen of The Nest.
Josie: Like, you have to paraphrase it down a bit because Minx basically improvs a play in front of you.
[More laughter]
Minna: Yes!
Rhi: I love it!
Josie: Basically ends with her sticking a knife into her own chest and lying down as if dead.
Rhi: Whoa, whoa.
Josie: No, it’s like, she’s playing all the parts right? So she’s playing someone getting stabbed. She has to pretend.
Minna: Minx is performing a one-woman play—
Rhi: She’s so talented.
Josie: Thank you!
Rhi: Of Brogan’s plan that doesn’t actually exist.
Minna: I love her.
Rhi: Okay, yeah.
Josie: Should I maybe roll something about it?
Rhi: Well, I think you have the information, and the idea for what the approach is here, now you guys just have to forge the evidence.
Josie: Right. How much study do you have, Myra?
Minna: I have 2 Study. And I could push myself for 3.
Josie: That’s not bad. And I can lend you aid with my dramatic performance.
Rhi: So that’s going to get you up to like 4, right?
Minna: Yep, that’s going to get me up to 4.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: That is a 5!
Rhi: Okay. Solid.
Josie: Sweet!
Rhi: I think we will come back to the results of that. So while the two of you are working on this, we cut up to Blaire who is at The Docks.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And you were told that this ghost problem was happening under The Docks, kind of in the canals and catacombs again. And they weren’t able to give you like a pinpoint location because it’s moving around but they gave you a general area.
Kim: And under The Docks, right?
Rhi: Yeah. But specifically it seems to be, somewhat unsurprisingly, hanging out in the area near Ink Row. This group of ghosts is staying close to the place where all of them died. You make your way down into the canals. As you’re walking you hear kind of a weird splashing sound behind you.
Kim: Blaire’s going to turn around and take a look to see what might have causes the sound. Do I need to roll anything to figure than out?
Rhi: No, you turn and hold up your lantern and there’s nothing there.
Kim: Huh. I’m going to put on my spirit mask and see if there’s anything out there.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: What does it look like in the ghost field?
Rhi: I mean, there’s kind of your normal spirits hanging out in the canals, as they do.
Kim: Okay, so nothing out of the ordinary?
Rhi: Yeah they’re not really – there’s just canal ghosts that the gondoliers talk to, it’s just a normal feature of the city.
Kim: Right. I’m looking for something abnormal, that may have causes the sound.
Rhi: Yeah, you don’t see anything.
Kim: Hm. Blaire’s going to take her mask off, kind of flip it over to rest on top of her head, and kind of shrug to herself. She doesn’t know what could have caused that noise. And I think she’s going to turn back around and go—
## Setarra enters [00:47:00]
Rhi: And as soon as you turn back around, you find yourself almost nose-to-nose with Setarra.
[Kim, as Blaire, reacts with surprise and distaste]
Rhi: Who’s like six inches in front of you.
Kim (as Blaire): Gee, Setarra, you scared me.
Rhi (as Setarra): Pay more attention.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, sorry. I didn’t know it was you.
Rhi (as Setarra): What are you doing down here?
Kim (as Blaire): I… am trying to fix something.
Rhi: She just kind of gives you an expectant look.
Kim (as Blaire): Trying to fix something that I caused. You know that ghost thing we did a couple of months ago that you helped out with?
Rhi (as Setarra): Ah, yes. Rescuing you and your friends from getting involved in something you couldn’t handle.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, well, all those ghosts are starting to become a Harvester and we’re trying to prevent that from happening.
Rhi (as Setarra): Seems like a waste of our time.
Kim (as Blaire): I – I didn’t know this was a ‘we’ project, did you, were you planning on helping with this or no?
Rhi (as Setarra): It is a ‘we’ project because it distracting from the things you should be focusing on.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, well this will take really quick, you know I’ve almost got it figured out, you know, I’ll, you know, take care of it and, you know whatever you’ve got planned for us next I can hop right on that, I swear.
Rhi (as Setarra): Ugh. We will see. Lead on. I suppose that if I don’t take the time to make sure that you do this properly, nothing will ever get done.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay. Will, I take it you haven’t seen a Harvester around here recently?
Rhi (as Setarra): I tend not to play much attention to the going-ons of the city, most of them are beneath me.
Kim (as Blaire): Fair. I mean you’re a very busy demon. So, I mean all that I was told was that they were near The Docks so I don’t know, I was probably going to hop into a canoe and like go around—
Rhi: She just holds up a hand and her eyes kind of go starry. And they go from just looking like a pitch black to looking like The Void Sea, with those pinpricks of light in it. And the water in the canal beside you ripples and then it’s sort of this ripple effect that kind of moves down the water and when it gets to a branch intersection, it splits out and you can hear the distant sound of water and after a few moments she lowers her hand, her eyes go back to normal and she just goes:
Rhi (as Setarra): Follow me.
Rhi: And strides off.
Kim (as Blaire): Great, thanks.
Rhi (as Setarra): As I said, if I want this to be done quickly and properly—
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Rhi (as Setarra): Apparently I’ll have to do it myself so you can get back to work.
Kim (as Blaire): Well…
Kim: She’s going to step in front of Setarra for a hot minute.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s the thing. I kind of have to be the one that does this. You can help, I would very much appreciate your help, but this is kind of a thing I need to do to prove myself.
Rhi (as Setarra): To who?
Kim (as Blaire): To… some people who want my help.
Rhi (as Setarra): If they want your help, why do you need to prove yourself?
Kim (as Blaire): They don’t trust very easily. They want to make sure, you know, I can do a job right.
Rhi (as Setarra): So it’s a test.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi (as Setarra): Well. Then I suppose we’ll see how well you do.
Rhi: And then she kind of gestures for you to walk forward.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Thanks.
Kim: And Blaire is going to start leading the way.
## End of Setarra’s first appearance [00:50:34]
Rhi: Let’s jump back to Minx and Myra. Myra has finished drafting the letters. How far back are you doing this, how many letters are you doing?
Josie: I think we need to do at least one from before the assassination.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Yeah. I think we need to do some that we’re going to plant at Harvale’s as well.
Rhi: Yeah. So you’re basically write both halves of this conversation between the two of you.
Josie: Right.
[She laughs]
Rhi: And so, since you got a 5, Myra writes these letters, kind of back and forth between herself and Brogan. The ones from Brogan, you do a pretty good job with his handwriting. But it’s not an exact match. You’re working off such a small sample of his stuff that you just for some words and things you just have to guess at how he would write them. So it’s pretty good. But it’s not flawless.
Minna: That’s fair.
Rhi: So, you’ve got these letters.
Josie: And now we have to be able to put them in Brogan’s place, and get some to her?
Rhi: Yeah, somehow you have to get this information in front of Lady Drake.
Minna: What if we set up, like a fake hideout, and send her a tip?
Rhi: Oh, so like… Yeah because people still don’t know where your lair is.
Minna: Just like an office or something.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. And then somehow find a way to tip her off.
[Josie and Minna agree]
Minna: I’m sure we could slip a note or something. We could send a note through an anonymous messenger. I would like to try and plant letters in Harvale’s place before we do that.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: So that when she gets our letters, she can then be like, okay let me check Harvale’s place.
Rhi: Yeah. So that is going to be breaking into his home, probably.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Right. Alright, well it’s going to be risky because he is a rich motherfucker and probably has a bunch of security.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: But I am down for going for a break-in. How are we doing it, are we playing it out like an actual score or…?
Rhi: I think it will be kind of a truncated score. Like I’m not going to go through every single nitty gritty detail. I will do an engagement roll though.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: I think with the various components at play, it will just be a one die engagement roll. Which is a 6! I think that you two arrive at his house up in Brightstone, at the end of a guardshift, it’s not like right when the guards are changing but it’s like half an hour before so they are more tired and less aware. So why don’t the two of you give me some kind of roll for sneaking into the place.
Minna: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Brogan is not home but somebody else is.
Minna: I’ll take that.
Josie: Do we want to make it a group action?
Minna: Oh, yeah let’s do that.
Josie: I have 6 stress, how much do you have?
Minna: I only have 3 right now.
Josie: Okay. Can you lead then?
Minna: Yeah. And I have rolled a 6.
Josie: Nice! I rolled a 4.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Perfect.
Rhi: So nobody takes any stress and on a 6, yeah, I think that it’s just like the guard at the back door is just asleep.
[Josie laughs]
Rhi: It’s like three in the morning and she snuck back here and is like napping in a corner. Has her coat pulled up over her head.
Josie: Aww, nap time.
Rhi: Yeah, she’s really tired. It’s been a long day.
Josie: This is a nice change of pace.
Rhi: So yeah, you’re able to pop the lock, slip inside and then you just have to sneak somewhere to plant these things.
Josie: I feel like we shouldn’t do his office. Because that’s too obvious.
Minna: Slid into some books on the mantel or something.
Josie: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, I think I need another roll for you sneaking to wherever you’re going to hide the books – or finding a suitable hiding place, you can roll either one.
Minna: Study?
Rhi: Sure.
Josie: Can I roll Survey instead? Because I actually have a dot in that?
Rhi: Yeah. You both can roll different things as you’re looking around. It’s just not a group action then.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I got a 2.
Rhi: Okay. So Minx, what is the incredibly appropriate title of the book you find?
Josie: Oh God.
Rhi: On the bookshelf. I’ll let you think about that.
Josie: Shoot, now I now I know how you feel.
Rhi: Yeah. Think about the- because it’s Minx, and I feel like she would be like ‘oh this book, which contains a story about betrayal is perfect’.
Josie: How about something like Blood in the Water or something?
Minna and Rhi: Ooh.
Rhi: Yeah. I think it’s like a play.
Josie: A play about some mariner or leviathan hunter who gets wrapped up in this plot of vengeance among nobles and the like.
Rhi: Okay so yeah, Minx is just so proud of yourself.
[Josie, as Minx, makes an excited sound]
Josie: We’re doing like subterfuge and social intrigue and stuff. This is my jam!
Rhi: Myra, I think that you get distracted trying to look for other information? You’re just trying to find more details about what Brogan is up to, what he knows, anything you might have missed? You’re like, ‘well, I’m in his house, might as well’. You actually kind of leave Minx in the study and head into his office. You grab like a stack of papers, and are leaning against the desk. And you’re flipping through them, you see a letter with very familiar handwriting on it. It is handwriting that you have know since you were fairly young.
[Minna makes a worried noise]
Rhi: It is a letter from Salia and this startles you so badly that you straighten up from your lean on the desk and as you do so, your arm bumps into some kind of statue. That falls off the desk and hits the ground with a very loud crash.
Minna: God damn it.
Josie (whispering): You can’t run from your past.
[All laugh and exclaim]
Rhi: So. You have just made a lot of noise.
Minna: I put everything back where I found it. And run.
Rhi: Okay, yeah so you put the papers back, are you trying to clean up the shards of broken statue?
Minna: No, that shit’s done.
[All laugh]
Minna: There’s so many other explanations for that besides a break-in.
Rhi: Yeah. And I think as you’re running to go catch back up with Minx, you hear footsteps moving upstairs. So I need one last roll to see if you two make it out of here okay.
Josie: Okay. Is there any chance of it being a Skirmish role?
Rhi: Possibly. Give me your logic for it.
Josie: It’s like, I’m not trying to stealthily escape? Or anything, because we already made the noise. We’re just going for speed and dexterity.
[Rhi sighs]
Rhi: That’s still more Prowl than Skirmish. Skirmish is more fighting, like if—
Josie: Okay, but what if I spend 2 stress to use Rook’s Gambit? And use Skirmish instead?
Rhi: You can absolutely do that. What does that put you at for stress?
Josie: 8.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: So I mean it’s not great but I don’t want to flub it right at the end here.
Rhi: No no no, that’s fair.
Minna: I rolled my Prowl and I got a 6.
Rhi: Nice.
Josie: I also got a 6!
Rhi: Alright, so the two of you just book it.
Josie: Just to add a bit more flavour to my Skirmish thing. Minx isn’t the one who hit statue over so she’s super proud of herself and is like doing the most dramatic motions she can while leaving.
[Rhi laughs]
Josie: And turns to look back and sweeps some loose fabric on her because she didn’t wear a full cape.
Minna: Minx is Tuxedo Mask right now.
[Everyone giggles]
Josie: My job here is done!
Minna and Josie: You didn’t do anything?
Rhi: And out the door she goes.
[More laughter]
Rhi: Yeah, and so as the two of you leave, you see a light turn on upstairs in a window but you slip away without incident. So you have planted your half of the letters in Brogan’s house. Well done.
Josie: Yay!
Rhi: So, we’re going to cut back over to Blaire. Setarra has been guiding her through the canals under the city and sort of, from the canals into the old catacombs. And, Blaire you know the underside of the city well enough that eventually you recognise that this is close to that smuggling tunnel that you all used to get into the Ink Row area in the first place.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: Eventually Setarra tells you to take a right and you turn. And it’s already kind of cool down here, under the city, you turn and step through this doorway and the temperature just plummets, you can see your breath. Setarra is just kind of standing behind you with her arms folded, just staring at you expectantly.
Kim: Okay, Blaire’s going to put on her spirit mask and should I roll Attune for this?
Rhi: Uh, if you’re just looking, no.
Kim: Oh yeah, no, I’m just looking.
Rhi: You remember – you looked at the Harvester in the ghost field. And you kind of remember what that looked like. This is not the same but you can definitely see the trajectory of where it’s getting to that point. You can still pick out individual ghosts. It’s like they’re orbiting something. It’s like there’s a black hole pulling them in. They’re not quite packed into it yet, but they’re all sort of orbiting around swirling in this limited space. So there’s about eight of them, all sort of in this big ghost mass. Swirling around, shrieking. A couple of them notice you, they look, but they don’t make any move towards you, they don’t seem to find you very interesting.
Rhi (as Setarra): Whatever you’re going to do, do it quickly.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, I’ve got a couple things we’ve got to try. Hopefully the first few will work. Here goes.
Kim: Blaire is going to walk closer to the ghost mass and her first approach is going to try to talk down to it gently. It’s probably not going to work but I want to see—
Rhi: It’s Blaire.
Kim: Yeah, I want to see her be compassionate for a hot minute.
Rhi: This girl is breaking my heart!
[Everyone laughs]
Kim: I’m sorry!
Rhi: No, it’s very good, it’s really good, it’s just like, I mean, yeah… Modern AU Blaire would be trying to talk down a rabid wolf.
Kim: Yes! That’s absolutely true. Blaire’s going to step and little closer and say:
Kim (as Blaire): Hey, hey it’s okay, I’m here to help. What do you need?
Rhi: Uh, give me a roll.
Kim: Oh boy, it’s probably Consort, isn’t it?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: I might push myself. I got a 6 for my highest.
Rhi: Seriously?
Kim: I rolled a 1 and a 6.
Rhi: Oh wow. Okay, so because it is eight ghosts I think you’re going to have been at reduced effect. So you’re not going to get all of them but there’s a couple that stop swirling and screaming. And there’s a boundary that they can’t move beyond by themselves. But two of them kind of peel off and float in front of you. There isn’t really a lot of identity left to them, they are very washed-out silhouettes but one of them cocks its head to the side:
Rhi (as a Harvester spirit): I remember you.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes!
Rhi (as a Harvester spirit): You promised us vengeance.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, yes! A couple months ago. You remember it, at The Docks.
Rhi (as a Harvester spirit): Yes… We wanted to make them pay.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, and you’ve done that. They’re gone now.
Rhi: The ghosts kind of nod and whatever this pole is, they seem to be resisting it. They’re still not able to move outside of this boundary, but the boundary seems to have loosened up a little bit. It’s like the gravitational pull isn’t as strong.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m here to help. I’m here to try to seperate as much of you as I can and set you free.
Rhi: It seems as though they have accepted what you have said and are letting go.
Kim: Yay! So I have two that I’ve officially broken off.
Rhi: Yeah… well, here, I’ll just do it as a clock.
Kim: Oh, Jesus, okay.
Rhi: Well, this is a good clock. When this clock fills in, you’ve been the pre-harvester.
Kim: Okay, I’m just predisposed to be nervous of clocks.
Rhi: I know, I knew you were going to react that way.
Kim: I hate clocks! I’m sorry.
Rhi: No, this is a good clock. This is a clock of Blaire succeeds.
Kim: Yay, I like this clock.
Rhi: And you are at 2 out of 8.
Kim: Awesome.
Rhi: On the clock of Blaire deals with this pre-Harvester.
Kim: Next thing I’m going to try is probably the electroplasm. She’s going to warn the two who have accepted:
Kim (as Blaire): I’m going to try and lure the rest of them. But I need the two of you not to get excited about what I’m going to do next, okay?
Rhi (as a Harvester spirit): We’ll try.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Kim: And she’s going to reach into one of her jars and bring out some of her electroplasmic food stuff.
Rhi: Yeah, make another roll of some kind. I think the last time you did this it was Attune? This has been Risky position, it’s going to continue to be because there’s six of them and one of you, it’s still going to be at reduced effect.
Kim: Okay, I rolled a 3 and a 6.
Rhi: The two ghosts that you pulled off, they don’t… it’s not twitching, they kind of shimmer more, or flicker when you put it out—
Kim: Kind of like how a flame moves, on a candle?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah! And then two more ghosts peel off from this swirling mass and just dive for the electroplasm.
Kim: Oh, okay, then Blaire drops it in that case. And she’s going to try talking to them while they’re eating, in that case?
Rhi: You have also successfully pulled those two off.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi, I’m here to help you.
Rhi: They’re further gone than the other two. They’re just draining the electroplasm and when you talk, one of them just lets out a wail. It doesn’t seem to be angry at you, it just doesn’t seem capable of speech.
Kim: She’s just going to let those two ghosts eat then.
Rhi: Okay, I think actually I want to cut back over to Minx and Myra. For the two of you, you have left Brogan’s house and now you need to get the letters ‘from Harvale’ in front of Lady Drake.
Minna: I think they’re sitting down at the table in the Nest to discuss this, probably? And Myra says:
Minna (as Myra): So I know somebody who might be very interested in buying the kind of information that we’re trying to get to Lady Drake. And she has her fingers in all of this right now. We just have to find somebody who is willing to take that message and sell it and pretend they’re not associated with us.
Josie (as Minx): Right, well that’s a lot of qualifiers there. I agree with this avenue but…
Minna (as Myra): I have a buyer in mind. We just need somebody who might believably have been here. Someone who might believable have been in our space and found some information. Do you know anybody who would be willing to take that risk?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, oh, I know! It could be Harker.
Minna: Oh, him! Yeah.
Josie: He’s down in the low places of the city and he’s like: ‘well, my people came across this while scrounging around, this might be interesting, huh?’
Rhi: I don’t think that the fact that you two are still on friendly terms is common knowledge?
Josie: Yeah. I don’t think it is, either, and even if it is…
Rhi: People stab each other in the back all the time, it’s Duskwall.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So where do you find him?
Josie: I’m thinking it’s in a backroom of, I don’t know, either a drug den or a brothel or something?
Rhi: Okay, yeah so the two of you, we’ll say a drug den, have made your way back to a private room separately. I think you’ve been in this room for like half an hour when he slips in. He’s like:
Rhi (as Harker): Huh, well Minx, good to see you again but this is all very cloak and dagger, what do you have in mind?
Josie (as Minx): Well, would you really have it any other way? It’s more exciting.
Rhi (as Harker): I suppose. Exciting tends to land me in prison though.
Rhi: He sits down, and he’s smoking something from up front, he takes a drag from it.
Josie: Minx was lightly smoking something but honestly seems more enamoured with the pipe she’s smoking it in. Just admiring the design.
Josie (as Minx): Well, fortunately, What I wish to talk to you today will likely secure against future stints.
Rhi (as Harker): Huh. That’d be nice.
Josie (as Minx): The difficulty is you’d have to pretend not to like me so much.
Rhi (as Harker): Alright…?
Josie (as Minx): Difficult, I know. Well, we have certain information that we would like others to come by, but obviously can’t come from us. And of course they would likely pay good coin for this information, as would I.
Rhi (as Harker): Do I want to know what this information is?
Josie (as Minx): Not especially. I will tell you if you want.
Rhi (as Harker): You know, I’ve heard about some of the stuff you’re getting mixed up in and I feel like the less I know, the better. Particularly if I do get picked up again then I can’t really tell them anything.
Josie (as Minx): A wise choice. Essentially it’s simple, just a delivery to a buyer.
Rhi: Well, if Minx is doing this meeting, Myra would have had to give her a name. Myra would have had to have told her this needs to be sold to Salia.
Minna: Yeah, yeah, she’d tell her to sell it to Salia.
Josie: Yeah, and she’ll give him a location and Salia’s name and stuff like that.
Rhi (as Harker): Alright. And just, how did I come by this?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, given things we have been involved in, moving around has been practically a pastime for us. Simply, it is not uncommon to come across a former Nest.
Rhi (as Harker): Alright, so… okay. Yeah. I was going to meet you at your old hideout, but you’d moved on, and I poked around and happened to find whatever was in these envelopes.
Josie (as Minx): And should this information find it’s target, you will have some amount of security from those who are higher up.
Rhi (as Harker): Huh. Alright.
Josie (as Minx): And the idea is to portray some amount of dividing between us – I do not wish for this divide you understand, you are a delight.
Rhi (as Harker): Oh, no, of course. I don’t see nearly as much of you as I’d like but certainly don’t want to burn any bridges here.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. And hopefully, should this cover the plan, we can see a bit more of each other.
Rhi: At that he kind of toasts you with his pipe. And I think then, yeah, the two of you hang out for a little bit. You leave first, he leaves sometime after. And now you’re leaving that in Harker’s hands, to see how that goes. So we’ll see how that plays out. Let’s cut back to Blaire.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: So you’ve gotten four of the ghosts broken off.
Kim: I think what I want to do next is command the remaining ghosts, because I know I’ve managed to succeed in commanding a far larger group before, although a lot of that was due to Scurlock, because I have no ranks in Command, it turns out.
[Rhi laughs]
Rhi: It’s going to be, because you reduced the number of ghosts down, you are at standard effect now.
Kim: Okay. 5.
Rhi: You do, but there is a consequence.
Kim: Could the consequence be that Setarra gets impatient and fed up and tries to cut things short before I really finish this?
Rhi: Yes, she’s going to interfere, is going to be the consequence. But go into what Blaire says.
Kim: Okay, Blaire is gonna try and muster up the energy that she had when she commanded that horde of ghosts all those months ago. She’s going to puff up her chest a little bit, and try and make herself a little bit authoritative and she’s just going to be like:
Kim (as Blaire): Remaining ghosts! Listen to me. I command all of you to seperate.
Rhi: They’re still just kinda eying you.
Kim (as Blaire): Move it!
[Everyone laughs]
Rhi: Blaire is so good. So, you say that and they still aren’t really moving. And then, from behind you, you hear Setarra speak and it’s a language that you have never heard before.
[Kim gasps]
Rhi: You don’t understand the words but you understand the meaning behind it. It is a voice like a wave crashing down on shore and destroying everything in its path.
[Kim gasps again]
Rhi: And the meaning behind it is ‘obey’ and ‘fall’. That barrier that you were feeling, snaps, those four ghosts that you were trying to wrangle at the end kind of go flying to the four corners of the room and slam down into the ground and are gone.
Kim: Oh no. Oh no no no no. They’re gone?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: The other four are kneeling. They haven’t moved but they are kneeling.
Kim: Blaire is going to whirl around back to Setarra and be like:
Kim (as Blaire): What, what just happened? What did you do?
Rhi (as Setarra): What you were failing at. I commanded them to separate and to be gone.
Kim (Blaire): Not the—
Rhi (as Setarra): Deal with the other four. This is taking too much time. This has taken more than enough time already.
Kim (as Blaire): But, I – I need those for a bag. Where did they go?
Rhi (as Setarra): They’re gone. They’ve been dealt with.
Kim (as Blaire): But how… how will—
Rhi (as Setarra): What?
Kim (as Blaire): How do we know they won’t turn into a Harvester too?
Rhi (as Setarra): They won’t.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re sure?
Rhi (as Setarra): Quite.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Thank you.
Kim: And she’s gonna drop her shoulders a little bit.
Rhi (as Setarra): Take care of these four, so that we can get out of here and you can get back to work that actually matters.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Kim: And, because they’re already obeying Setarra’s commands, do you think they’d go into the jar pretty easily?
Rhi: Uh-huh. They do whatever you tell them. Which is unnerving. Normally there’s a lot of coaxing involved in getting ghosts into jars, but these ghosts, you tell them ‘get in the jar’ and they just go immediately.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Kim: And she jar’s them up, one by one, and she has four ghost-jars, all set up, and she puts them away in her pack.
Rhi: I think that when you turn, Setarra has kind of gone back to the arms crossed, judging look and is just like:
Rhi (as Setarra): Your purpose is knowledge that will lead to power. This is a waste of your time and mine. Bring me something useful and then we will see if I will be willing to continue to help you.
Kim (as Blaire): Something useful… Got it.
Rhi: She steps back towards the canal and you just hear a splashing sound. And she disappears.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna just let out a deep breath and, lets see, the thing she has to do next is make a quick detour to The Deathlands and set these ghosts free and—
Rhi: We can just cinematically, narratively, do that.
Kim: Exactly, yeah, I was thinking either like a downtime scene, or whatever.
Rhi: So yeah I think that we can just have a shot of Blaire with her now very clinking backpack, heading back up to get rid of these ghosts.
Kim: Are they still under Setarra’s spell when I let them go or do they go pretty easily?
Rhi: Yeah, you’re not sure if they were reacting because they were under her control or if they were doing that because they were scared out of their minds? Cause when you get out there, they basically shoot out and just flee.
Kim: Yeah, they’re back to normal.
Kim (as Blaire): Bye!
Rhi: Okay, so Blaire dealt with the would-be Harvester, Minx and Myra have started some information moving and yeah, let’s do downtime. Blaire,let’s start with you.
Kim: The thing that’s on Blaire’s mind is ‘okay, something useful, something useful, something useful’ and she is like digging through her brain trying to find something that she thinks Setarra would be interested in. And she comes across that old book that she can’t really understand but knows on some certain level that it’s filled summoning spells, rituals, incantations, stuff like that.
Rhi: You can’t read the language it’s written in but you recognise some of the arcane symbols as being similar to the ones that you use when you summon Setarra.
Kim: She’s kind of thumbing through the pages like:
Kim (as Blaire): Huh, this’ll work.
Kim: And she’s probably just going to tuck that book underneath her arm and go outside to summon Setarra and show her this.
Rhi: Okay. So I think you have a usual spot near The Nest where you go to summon Setarra. So you set out the bowl of seawater, you draw the chalk symbols on the floor, you do all the things. And Setarra surges into being and looks at you and just raises an eyebrow and goes:
Rhi (as Setarra): Well?
Kim (as Blaire): I found something I think you’ll like.
Kim: And she is going to offer the book up to her.
Rhi: And Setarra steps forward and takes it and her expression kind of brightens a little bit, as she’s looking at this book she starts paging through it and her eyes widen a little. And she gets the same kind of predatory shark toothed smile that she gave when you asked her to help beat up the Bluecoats. She gets that same smile and looks up at you and goes:
Rhi (as Setarra): Oh Blaire, this will do very nicely.
Rhi: And she slams the book shut. So, we leave Blaire talking with Setarra and go over to Minx and Myra, who are in, I assume, the common area of the Nest?
Josie: Alright, so I think Minx is also kind of using the leftovers of her scrapbooking project to add more things to her vision board?
[Rhi laughs]
Josie: We got her started, and now she’s on a tear.
Josie (as Minx): So Myra, dearie, you did seem to pull this Salia person a bit out of nowhere. How did you know they would deal with this?
Minna (as Myra): Oh… It’s a very long story. We can start with, her people have been everywhere lately. Everytime we deal with the circle.
Josie (as Minx): Ah. Your old friends, as it were?
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm. I have met two of them recently.
Josie (as Minx): One at the railyard, who’s the other?
Minna (as Myra): Clave, at the auction. I guess only Phin was there. And when I was in Brogan’s house, I saw a letter from Salia which isn’t unexpected, she talks to everybody who’s anybody, if she can and Brogan is exactly the type of person she’d want to make deals with. But I figured she’d be interested in this whole mess, especially if it gave her a way to get back at me.
Josie (as Minx): Now, that’s interesting. Especially as I couldn’t help but notice after you go into the office and see this, the statue breaks. Are you, are you alright?
Minna (as Myra): I’m fine, I just wish she wasn’t involved in this as well. It’s bad enough that we’ve got people like the Circle after us but I, I just wanted to be done with her, y’know?
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm. yes, well, I’m hardly the one to criticise for old connections causing trouble.
Minna (as Myra): That’s right. Only, I don’t think you’d like Salia. Not that I like Bazso now anyway.
Josie (as Minx): Well I suspect not, but why wait until now to tell us? This seems like an important connection if we’re keeping you safe, if for no other reason.
[Minna, as Myra, sighs]
Minna (as Myra): It didn’t seem important to bring it up? She’s – most of the time, she’s not the kind of person to go after a person directly. She’ll find ways to manipulate you and get her claws into you, but as long as I stayed away from her it was fine… I figured. Until all of this, she could get leverage that I don’t want her to have. But, for the moment, I can use that, because I want her to have this particular leverage.
Josie (as Minx): Well, glad to hear we have the upper hand but… why? Why does she want vengeance or whatever she wants?
Minna (as Myra): Because I was supposed to work for her for I guess forever? I think that’s what she thought?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, oh dear. And she doesn’t take kindly to you leaving, I imagine?
Minna (as Myra): No, no she doesn’t. She doesn’t take kindly to me leaving. I think she thought I would fail and come crawling back to her. But, jokes on her, because I’m either going to die or I’m going to succeed wildly!
Josie (as Minx): Well, you’re with me and Blaire. Of course it’s going to be the latter.
Minna (as Myra): So far it has been. Surprisingly.
Josie (as Minx): Myra, again, I’m hardly the one to say this and I don’t want to force anything out of you, but it does mean a lot when you share this sort of thing and I think we all work better as a crew the more we know about each other at this point.
Minna (as Myra): I agree, now that she’s mixed up in everything it doesn’t make sense to keep the information from you guys, it can only make things more dangerous if you don’t know what we’re facing.
Rhi: I think on that note the door opens, and Blaire comes in.
Kim (as Blaire): Hey!
Josie (as Minx): Hello, dear.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire! Where’ve you been?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, you know, just outside. Had to get some air.
Minna (as Myra): Lot of air then?
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): No I went for a walk. I had to go, uh, lend a book to Quellyn.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. Nothing that’s gonna follow you home?
Kim (as Blaire): No! No, no, no.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that’s good to hear. Would you care to join me in some additional scrapbooking? You missed out earlier.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes!
Kim: And she’s going to pull a chair at the table.
Rhi: And so I think that we kinda zoom in on the newspaper that Minx is cutting up into pieces for her typography project.
[Josie laughs again]
Rhi: And then zoom out on another paper and the headline reads: ‘Harvale Brogan arrested. Centuralia Club ownership in question.’ There is a sketch, I think it it’s like an artist’s rendering of the arrest and it is Brogan in cuffs with a few Bluecoats and Chief Inspector Severin leading him away.

"Season 2, Episode 8: The Langdon Imports Score, Part 1 Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
Download a Word doc version: TM2-08 The Langdon Imports Score, Part 1
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us, and apologies for how croaky I sound in this intro. I’m either losing my voice after a long volunteer shift yesterday or I’m getting sick. Either way, I was perfectly fine when we recorded this episode, so I won’t sound like this the whole time, don’t worry.
Today’s episode is a special one because it marks the one year anniversary of The magpies. February 20, 2018 I launched the first episode of this show out into the world. I figured we’d get 20 listeners if we were lucky. Now, a year later, we have over 61,000 downloads, nearly 700 Twitter followers, and over 60 Patreon supporters. This podcast has been so much more than I ever could have dreamed and I’m still blown away by the support and love we get from our fans. Thank you all so much from all of us on the cast. We love creating this show and sharing this story with you all.
One quick announcement, the transcript for Season 1, Episode 4 is up on the site. We’re slowly chipping away at our backlog of episodes that need transcripts, but if you’d like to help us reach that goal faster please back us on Patreon. When we hit $300 per month I’ll be able to hire more transcribers and start getting transcripts up a lot faster.
Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Kim: McLean Hospital is a psychiatric hospital in Massachusetts that is committed to helping adults, adolescents, and their families struggling with mental illness and addiction, and on a personal note it was their inpatient program that I attended when I was in crisis back in the fall of 2017. The people and the staff at McLean are so incredibly compassionate and respectful of everyone who comes through their doors, and I feel so lucky that I was able to receive their quality care. If you’d like to donate, visit them at givemclean.partners.org.
Rhi: As always, please continue to visit 5calls.org and call your representatives. On a personal local note, if you’re in Chicago make sure to get out and vote. We have the opportunity to make some big changes in our city’s leadership, and with early voting and same-day registration you’ve got plenty of time to get to the polls.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:40]
Rhi: We open up with a wide shot over Coalridge. There’s smoke pouring out of the factories, the constant clanging sounds from the ironworks and the coal mine. We move down into the factory area over to what is clearly a very new construction tenement building, and there is a ring of Bluecoats around the front of the building. Back by the door are a number of workers who are clamoring and shouting. You can hear things like you can’t keep us prisoner here, we have families, we have homes, you know, those sorts of shouting. Then there’s a man standing back with the Bluecoats with his arms folded.
Rhi (as Man): These are your new lodgings. We are paying for them out of the company coffers. This is where you will stay and you will follow our curfew.
Rhi: Then a bottle throws out of the crowd, misses the guy who was talking, but hits one of the Bluecoats, and the Bluecoats surge forward, and we just pan back up as there’s shouting and the sounds of people being hit with truncheons, and just the general altercation happening there.
We fade back in on The Hound’s Paw where The magpies find themselves as usual. What are you all up to?
Josie: I think Minx is sketching something. It looks like she’s designing an outfit, but she’s focusing on veils and stuff. She wants to find a veil that actually works against ghosts, kind of.
Josie (as Minx): I need this fashion statement, but it needs to actually do it.
Kim: I’m going to say that Blaire brought a book with her this time. I think she’s probably taking notes along in her journal as she reads.
Rhi: Oh, are she and Minx—Is this a collaborative project? Are you both-? Is she researching ways that you could make fabric that is resistant to being seen through the ghost field?
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: I did not consider it, but I like it. May I add something?
Rhi: [laughs] Yes.
Kim: She is not researching ways to make the veil ghost proof, rather she is trying to configure a way to have the veil act as a spirit mask.
Rhi: Hmm. So the opposite of what Minx wants.
Kim & Josie: Yes.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Because what you’re doing is like super impractical.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Impractical? Sometimes our identities need to remain a secret, and if there’s an entire population you communicate with that can simply see through the disguise that’s no good.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but who’s gonna believe a ghost? Who’s gonna rat you out? I mean, come on.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, there are other ghosts to rat us out to.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but…
Minna (as Myra): And there are ghosts who take possession of people who would be believed.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah… I mean, yes, there is that, but there are other protections you can use and the veil is not it.
Minna (as Myra): What kind of protections can you use?
Kim (as Blaire): You know, the usual, like spirit bane charms, stuff like that.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, but it is my understanding that doesn’t prevent them from seeing you.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, but it keeps them away.
Minna (as Myra): Only to a certain extent, and only to a certain power level.
Kim (as Blaire): Right. But you know, willpower has a lot to do with it too. You see, if you’re not a chicken…
Minna: [chuckles]
Josie (as Minx): I—I am not a chicken.
Kim (as Blaire): [giggles]
Josie (as Minx): They just make me uncomfortable. Besides, if we are dealing with ghosts the fashion must match; veils, the more supernatural paraphernalia we put into it, the more black lace must be included. It’s a direct correlation.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… I mean, I’m just speaking for myself, but if I were a ghost I wouldn’t want everyone around me to act and dress like they were still at my funeral, like get over it.
Josie (as Minx): … Did you just tell me to get over fashion?
Rhi & Minna: [fighting giggles throughout]
Kim (as Blaire): No, no. What I’m saying is that if people around me, as a ghost, still dressed and acted like they were at my funeral, I would want them to move on with their lives.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm. I suppose it might conjure poor memories.
Minna (as Myra): So you’re against mourning fashion?
Kim (as Blaire): To an extent. It has its uses, and its time and place, but don’t dress like that all the time around me. Like that’s a bummer. Being a ghost is already bummer enough.
Josie (as Minx): So what you’re saying is I should instead go for some sort of wide brimmed hat?
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] yeah!
Josie: I don’t think people in this universe would call it a sun hat, maybe a moon hat instead.
Rhi: No.
Kim (as Blaire): No-no-no! It would be like you would wear on opening day of a race at a dog race.
Josie (as Minx): Precisely. Let’s make it a day at the races rather than a funeral date.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! Yes. See, you got it.
Minna (as Myra): So celebrate the life that you had.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes! See, you guys got it.
Josie (as Minx): And this will go with more outfits.
Kim (as Blaire): [quietly] Eh, I may have created a monster.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Although, the truism still stands that the more ghostified it is the more goth it must be.
Kim (as Blaire): Ehh… not necessarily.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, when do you wear bright colors?
Kim (as Blaire): [flatly] Never. [abruptly] Also, there’s a very—
[laughter]
Minna (as Myra): A point to Minx.
Rhi: At this point in the conversation the door of the bar swings open and a young woman comes in. Myra, you probably recognize her but I don’t know if you would necessarily be able to place her. She looks familiar to Myra. Blaire, Minx, I don’t think either of you have met her before. She is skinny in the way that says she doesn’t get enough to eat on a regular basis, has kind of a sickly pallor to her skin. She glances around and spots your table and hurries over.
Minna (as Myra): Hello.
Rhi (as Woman): [meekly] Hi. Um… I’m sorry. I don’t think I’ve met most of you. Is Phin here?
Minna (as Myra): Phin is not, but we are quite able to help you with whatever matter she would have helped with.
Rhi (as Woman): Oh, um… My name’s Teagan. Phin and I think you, Myra—
Minna (as Myra): Oh, Teagan. How wonderful to see you again.
Rhi (as Teagan): Yeah… You helped me at the clinic a few months ago. Phin had told me that anytime that I needed help that I could ask you, ask The magpies.
Minna (as Myra): That is still true.
Rhi (as Teagan): [sighs in relief] Okay. Good. [coughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Are you okay?
Rhi (as Teagan): Yeah, it’s just, uh, everybody that lives in Coalridge ends up with this cough after a while. Heh. I um… The situation is a little complicated, but there is someone in Charhollow who my dads work with sometimes. He kind of passes around information and things like that. He’s run into some trouble, and needs some help, and I thought this seemed like maybe the kind of thing that you could help with?
Josie (as Minx): Well, yes, I suppose it depends on the task, and I wouldn’t lie to say that it sounds as though they also provide useful services.
Rhi (as Teagan): Yeah. I think that you might be able to help each other. It’s a complicated situation. I don’t… Honestly, I’m not sure I even understand the whole thing.
Minna (as Myra): Is there somebody you would like to put us in contact with instead?
Rhi: She nods.
Rhi (as Teagan): His name is Briggs. He runs a clothing stall over in the Charhollow market. If you go there tell him that Teagan sent you and he’ll fill you in. I don’t know how much this is going to be able to pay, we can try to scrape something together…
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t have to worry about that.
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Teagan): Okay…
Josie (as Minx): Yes. In fact, in the meantime, you may wish to spend lunch time here. I’m sure Rigney can accommodate a meal for you.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. It’s on us.
Minna: Myra actually reaches out a hand to Teagan.
Minna (as Myra): Have you been all right? I know that Phin was helping you for a little bit there.
Rhi (as Teagan): Um… Yeah. I’ve still been cleaning houses and things. I haven’t gone back to the clinic. [coughs] We’re getting by. It’s…
Rhi: She shrugs and shakes her head.
Rhi (as Teagan): Are you sure about the lunch? I mean, I don’t want to take advantage…
Josie (as Minx): Yes, absolutely certain, in fact I insist.
Rhi (as Teagan): All right.
Rhi: She’ll sit down and Rigney will put her meal on your tab. If you ask about her situation, both of her fathers work in one of the factories in Coalridge and she does housecleaning. She’s a little bit younger than Blaire even, but there’s still some of the community fixtures from those neighborhoods that, Minx and Myra, you might recognize from your time growing up in those areas that she can tell you about.
Minna: Is Briggs one of those features?
Rhi: Possibly. I will leave it up to you if either of you recognize the name.
Minna: I mean, he runs a clothing stall, I can think of somebody who might recognize that.
Josie: Yeah. I might be interested. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. You know, it’s Charhollow, it’s not fine clothing.
Josie: Right, but still.
Rhi: Yeah. I can see a young Minx…
Minna: Way back in the day she bought secondhand clothing from Briggs.
Josie: Yeah!
Rhi: And Minx, if you ask a few questions there, Teagan will tell you that aside from this latest incident he’s doing well, he’s been able to expand his wares a little bit.
Josie (as Minx): I assume there’s somewhat less gray involved.
Rhi (as Teagan): No. I mean, everything in Coalridge and that area just kind of ends up grayish anyway. All the coal dust…
Josie (as Minx): True, but at least branch out into black. Black is classic.
Rhi (as Teagan): Oh, yeah, there’s that. A lot of beige that ends up grayish after a while too. Anyway, I have a house that I have to get to, but thank you so much for lunch and for helping with this.
Josie (as Minx): It’s no issue, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, and here, take this.
Kim: Blaire is gonna hand her a little pouch of tea leaves.
Kim (as Blaire): If your throat starts getting a little bit sore…
Rhi (as Teagan): [unsure] Oh. Um, okay… Thank you. That’s very kind.
Rhi: She tucks the little pouch away, and then she heads out.
Kim (as Blaire): Poor kid.
Rhi: Rigney leans over the bar.
Rhi (as Rigney): I don’t have any more open positions. I’m sorry.
Minna (as Myra): Oh…
Josie (as Minx): It’s quite all right, Rigney.
Rhi (as Rigney): Just, you all have a type in your strays.
Minna (as Myra): We’re not going to fob off all of our strays on you.
Rhi (as Rigney): I would help if I could, but I’ve only got so much in the budget.
Josie (as Minx): And her situation like many in Charhollow is not uncommon. To think though, if The Hound’s Paw were that big.
Rhi (as Rigney): [laughs] Yeah. Well, I’d probably have to move to different digs, and I like this place.
Kim (as Blaire): You never thought of franchising?
Rhi (as Rigney): No, because then I… The people that I’ve got working for me I feel good about managing, but then I’d have to hire more people to manage other people, and then it just starts getting a lot less direct oversight, and then somebody’s embezzling your funds, and then a building burns down for insurance fraud, and…
Josie (as Minx): This is quite a thorough series of unfortunate events you’ve imagined for yourself.
Minna (as Myra): Very specific.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Is there something you want to tell us?
Rhi (as Rigney): What? I was a server at another bar that had management problems.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay!
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Minna (as Myra): [smiling] Sounds like you’re well out of it.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah. Oh, there’s a reason that I own my own place now.
Rhi: So, the three of you gonna head off to Charhollow?
Kim & Josie: Yep!
## Charhollow [0:16:40]
Rhi: A lot of people in Nightmarket are heading back to work, heading inside. There’s an early afternoon fog rolling in. It’s getting a bit chillier. As you pass into Coalridge on your way to Charhollow there’s not as many people out in the streets, but there’s still that constant noise that you’re all familiar with having been through this area for a while. You make your way up to the Charhollow Market. The last time you were here actually was after the fire in The Docks. This is where the refugees were moved to. There’s really not a lot of signs of those refugees here now, it seems like they’ve all moved on in one way or another. The market is a bustling center of activity. There are people with stalls selling all kinds of wares. You kind of have to fend off a few people who are fairly aggressive about trying to get you to try their pickled eel.
Josie: “Fresh fish!”
Rhi: [laughs] yeah.
Kim: I’ll try a pickled eel.
Rhi: [laughing] Blaire is actually taking all of the samples that people are offering.
Kim: [smiling] yes, she is.
Rhi: Minx, you more or less remember where Briggs had his stall setup. You probably get turned around a couple times, but you manage to find your way over to it. A lot of the stalls in the center of the market are clearly very temporary. In some cases it’s just a rug rolled out on the ground or a wagon that has been parked there for the day. Around the outer edges where Briggs is setup, things are a little more permanent. Everything can still be taken down and packed away, but they are large tents. The one that Briggs is in is a 10 by 10 tent that has cloth hanging down on three sides enclosing it. As you step in you see there’s a couple tables and some crates that are stacked with worn but clean and very neatly folded clothes. Most of it does look secondhand, you can see where things have been patched or darned, but it’s all the kind of stuff that Minx would wear when she’s dressing down. It is sturdy working clothes, all of it in various shades of gray and brown and black.
Sitting towards the back of the tent are two figures. The first is an older man, looks like he’s in his 50s, shaved head, a lot of scars on the top of his head and around his face, and one eye is that sort of milky white and the other is blue. He raises his head when the three of you come in, as does the enormous dog sitting on the ground next to him.
Josie: [gasps]
Kim & Minna: [dreamy noises]
Rhi: It looks like a cross between an Irish Wolfhound and just a wolf. This dog is GIANT and very shaggy.
Kim (as Blaire): Puppy~
Josie: A good boof.
Kim: Blaire leans down to pet it.
Minna: [smiling] I think it’s a working dog. I don’t think you should touch it.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Oh! Oh, never mind. I do not touch it.
Rhi: yeah, the dog does not… She stays sitting next to him. She just kind of raises her head.
Rhi (as Man): Oh. Come on in. What can I get for you?
Josie (as Minx): Evening. I don’t suppose you’d have this in black, now would you?
Josie: Minx gestures to her clothes.
Rhi (as Man): Heh. You’re gonna have to tell me what you’re pointing at. Can tell where the three of you are, can’t really see what you’re gesturing at there.
Josie (as Minx): I was thinking my blue cloak.
Rhi (as Man): Well, we have a few cloaks over on the right hand side here.
Rhi: He points to where some cloaks are.
Josie (as Minx): Briggs, it’s me, Ellie.
Rhi (as Briggs): [long gasp] I thought I recognized your voice! Ah.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] It’s been a long time, hasn’t it?
Rhi (as Briggs): It has! That’s very rude of you to not introduce yourself to an old friend.
Josie & Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: He holds out a hand to you.
Josie: She shakes.
Rhi (as Briggs): Wow, it’s been… It’s been quite a while since you’ve been around these parts.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well it’s hard for me to stay away when there’s a friend in need.
Rhi: He cocks his head to the side.
Rhi (as Briggs): What are you talking about?
Josie (as Minx): Teagan said you may need our assistance.
Rhi (as Briggs): Ah.
Rhi: He pauses for a second.
Rhi (as Briggs): I didn’t realize that was you. All right. Whichever one of you is closest to the front, there’s a curtain tied up. Can you pull it across?
Minna: I’ll go do it.
Rhi: As you pull the curtain there’s a little bell that jangles. He waits until it’s stopped ringing, that the curtain is closed.
Rhi (as Briggs): [exhales] All right. I guess I feel a little bit better knowing that you’re a part of this, Ellie. [sighs] Right. So, how much did Teagan tell you? I’m guessing not much. She was just sort of carrying the message.
Josie (as Minx): No. Just that you were in need of aid and services might be exchanged.
Rhi (as Briggs): You were probably a little too young to be wrapped up in this when you were around here. I handle a lot of information, people tell me things that they hear. Some of it is just gossip, but gossip has its uses. I collect that information, sell it to folks who need it, pass on some of the pay to the people who tell me things. It’s been a pretty reliable system, but I’ve lost contact with part of my network. We had a lot of folks over in Coalridge who were passing on information for union organizers over there trying to get around the strike breakers and the scabs. A couple weeks ago one of the factory owners, a guy by the name of Tomasz Wott, got a bug up his ass about from what I heard it was inspired by what that Mora fellow was trying to do up on The Docks, have the factory and the tenements together. So, Wott had a tenement built and moved all of his workers in there, told them they could live there rent free, which sounds great.
Josie (as Minx): But…?
Rhi (as Briggs): Except it’s just the workers, it’s not their families, and Wott cut their pay to accommodate for the fact that they’re not paying rent, except they are paying rent for their families. There’s also real strict curfews. If they’re not at the factory they’re supposed to be in the tenement. I think it’s Wott’s way of trying to keep people from making it to the organizing meetings, but who knows.
Josie (as Minx): Sounds a bit more like a prison than a boarding house.
Rhi (as Briggs): Yeah. Well, that was the reaction of a lot of the workers. They, well, I think it was over too quick to call it a riot. They pushed back, it got beaten down as those things usually do around here, and I’ve got a lot of people who can’t get me information and more importantly can’t see their families.
Josie (as Minx): Well, the good news, we are especially inclined to assist with matters as these.
Rhi (as Briggs): [laughs] Well, that’s good to hear.
Josie (as Minx): Is there any more you can tell us about this Wott fellow?
Rhi (as Briggs): Not much. Kind of a typical factory owner. He comes from money. I think his brother is some magistrate up in Brightstone. Selfish, greedy, cruel, what you’d expect from somebody who runs one of these places.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. To be clear, we are ridding the place of the tenement situation not simply taking your folks away from it?
Rhi (as Briggs): That would be ideal. A lot of the other factory workers are kind of watching this experiment of Wott’s, and if it’s profitable…
Minna (as Myra): They’re gonna do it everywhere.
Rhi (as Briggs): Mm-hmm.
Rhi: He points in Myra’s direction and nods.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] I should have known we wouldn’t have killed it with that riot.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Well, there’s always time for more riots, I believe.
Rhi (as Briggs): However you do it, I’m not real particular, just try not to get too many of our people hurt. I don’t really care what happens to Wott, although if he does die they’re gonna take it out on the workers.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Hmm. And then with everyone back on the street and with us reacquainted, I imagine information can be shared both ways?
Rhi (as Briggs): Indeed, yeah. I know people that work all over the city. They could pass you all kinds of tips.
Josie (as Minx): In that case, not to cut a reunion short, but I do believe we have a war room of sorts to conduct.
Rhi (as Briggs): Yep, although you should probably buy something while you’re here. Usually I only close the curtain if people are trying stuff on.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Oh yes! It has been quite a while.
Josie: Minx is gonna immediately go off to the shirt section and look for high-collared shirts and come away with a couple, or maybe a fashionable turtleneck.
Rhi: Uh, no. There is nothing in this place that would really qualify as fashionable.
Josie: Aw. [laughs] Well yeah, but a turtleneck would be practical, right? Because it protects your neck from exposure and damage and all that, what with a lot of manual labor going on.
Rhi: You do find… [laughs]
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: I rolled a partial success, so you are able to find a mock turtleneck.
Josie: [laughing] What is a mock turtleneck?
Minna: It’s the thing that you wore in the 90s as a child.
Rhi: I was gonna say, it’s very 90s.
Josie: Mm-hmm. She pulls it out, sort of screws up her nose at it, and says:
Josie (as Minx): It will have to do. I can work on it.
Josie: Then she’ll buy that. [laughs]
Rhi: When you take out the small amount of coins you need to pay for this, he points at the dog.
Rhi (as Briggs): Come on, Mallory. You know the drill.
Rhi: The dog stands up, which puts her head at your stomach…
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: …and pads forward a couple steps and leans forward to sniff at the hand with the money in it.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: As she’s sniffing at the coins, Briggs just goes:
Rhi (as Briggs): Yeah, I trained her how to smell silver. A couple years ago a guy tried to pay me with pewter coins, thought that he could get away with it since I couldn’t see him.
Josie (as Minx): That is utterly brilliant.
Rhi (as Briggs): She took his whole hand off.
Josie (as Minx): What a good dog.
Kim (as Blaire): What a good dog…
[giggling]
Rhi: After she finishes sniffing at the coins for a couple seconds she raises her head and lets out a happy bark and pants at you and wags her tail.
Josie & Minna: Aww!
Rhi (as Briggs): Excellent!
Rhi: And he holds out his hand for the money.
Josie: I’ll pay him. What an extremely good dog. She’s so big!
Kim: I want to pet her so bad, but she’s working and I can’t distract her.
Rhi: [laughs] After you pay, he’s like:
Rhi (as Briggs): When you head out, can you slide the curtain back for me?
Minna (as Myra): Will do.
Rhi (as Briggs): Thanks, and good luck. If there’s anything else you wanna know feel free to stop back in. I’ll see what I can come up with. I haven’t lost contact with everybody.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you, Briggs.
Rhi: He waves as the three of you head out.
Josie: All right. Sounds like some Gather Information times?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: I think Minx is not gonna do her usual. She does have this new turtleneck.
Rhi: [snickers] Mock turtleneck.
Josie: So she is gonna dress down a little bit, and I think she’s gonna hit up a bar or something. Well, she is kind of doing her usual, but in the working class sense not the snooty café sense.
Rhi: Minx, you head off to a pub called Kellen’s, and this is a place that you are very familiar with. Everybody who lives in Charhollow knows Kellen’s. It’s one of the oldest pubs in the city. It is rumored to have a history that dates back to the founding of the city which would make it pre-cataclysmic…
Josie: Oh geez.
Rhi: …which is unlikely.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: But it has always been a Skovlan institution, it’s always been owned by Skovlanders. They have a wide selection of Skovlan whiskeys and ales, and it’s actually the kind of place where if you’re a rich person who wants to slum it you go to Kellen’s because then you can feel like you’re brushing elbows with the working class, but there’s also really good quality drinks, so you don’t actually have to slum it.
Josie: Right. Fitting.
Rhi: Minx, you would also know this. In the years since the Unity war ended and Skovlan was forced into the Empire, the bar has been the target of a lot of anti-Skovlander activity, people graffiti-ing the place, there have been a few windows broken, but most people don’t think that the bar is actually in any kind of danger, it’s just such a permanent institution of the city.
Josie: Yeah. This does sound like Minx’s kind of bar.
Rhi: Yeah. I imagine when you were younger you and Bazso and Nyryx probably hung around here picking pockets or running cons on some of the rich people who would come down here.
Josie: Right, and maybe once we were actually old enough, maybe drinking here sometimes.
Rhi: yes. Oh, for sure. You absolutely did, probably before you were old enough, truth be told.
Josie: Fair. [laughs]
Rhi: All right. What are you looking to do here?
Josie: I’m looking to go more the Consort route. I do need to put up a bit of a façade here, but I actually kind of want to legitimately reconnect with my roots a little bit. I don’t know if the bartender is someone I know… Hold on. I have, on my shrewd friends list as a neutral contact, I have Klyra, a tavern owner.
Rhi: There we go. Done. [laughs] Perfect. I think Klyra is seven or eight years older than you, and when Minx was a young tween just discovering what crushes were you were desperately in love with her.
Josie: Aww. Yes!
Minna: Augh~!
Rhi: Just head over heels infatuated.
Kim: Gayyy.
Josie: Good old gayby.
Rhi: She was 19. She helped her mom out at the bar. There were probably a couple cons or pickpocketing lifts that you screwed up because you were just staring at her all heart eyes.
Josie: [smiling] Rhi… That’s so good.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: That’s so good. Thank you for this gift, this gift of sweet baby gays.
Rhi: yes! So, she is at the bar, it seems like she is running the place now. She glances up when you come in and does a double-take, and is giving you that look of I know you from somewhere but hell if I know from where.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] Don’t worry dear, I’ll help you out. It’s Ellie.
Rhi (as Klyra): No shit! Ellie?! Wow!
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Rhi (as Klyra): You… Wow. What the- It has been, God, it’s been like a decade since I’ve seen you.
Josie (as Minx): Oh. I suppose it must have been, huh. I’m very glad to see you exactly where I expected you to be.
Rhi (as Klyra): Yeah. Mom retired a couple years ago and let me take over.
Josie (as Minx): Oh really? How is she doing?
Rhi (as Klyra): OH, she’s doing good. She honestly is spending most of her retirement up in Silkshore, which I can’t blame her, she earned it.
Josie (as Minx): Quite.
Rhi (as Klyra): I just wish she wouldn’t share quite so many details with me.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs]
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi (as Klyra): Anyway! Sit down, sit down! Let me get you a drink. What brings you here?
Josie (as Minx): Well, it’s been too long, frankly, and I just needed to check around the old stomping grounds and make sure everyone is all right.
Rhi (as Klyra): Hmm? All right.
Rhi: She gives you a glass of some kind of whiskey.
Josie: Minx nods and smiles appreciatively.
Josie (as Minx): Also, I couldn’t help but notice certain current events and I wanted to make sure everyone is able to see their families.
Rhi (as Klyra): Oh yeah. [sighs] That’s a fucking mess, and likely to get worse if something doesn’t change. I’m worried they’re gonna have everybody locked up in there and that’s my whole business.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Well, I can’t imagine, what with the discontent, it is actually profitable. It must end at some point, yes?
Rhi: I think at this point we’ll need a roll to figure out how much she actually knows about the situation.
Josie: I can do that. I’ve got a 3d6 Consort coming down the line… Six.
Rhi: Nice! She shrugs.
Rhi (as Klyra): I don’t know, I mean, Wott, the guy who runs the place, cut wages. It’s hard to hear much reliable, but from the rumors that I’ve heard he cut wages at least in half, since he figures his people don’t have to pay rent anymore.
Josie (as Minx): Except now they have two places of dwelling. That makes no sense.
Rhi (as Klyra): Yeah. He’s at least saving money there. They’re able to enforce people getting to work on time, so I don’t know how much of an impact that’s actually having on the bottom line, but it might. Honestly, I think it’s less about the profits, I think the real reason is to keep people from getting involved with Mrs. Brogan’s work, her rallying, trying to organize people. I mean, I support her ,but…
Josie (as Minx): Ah. That’s despicable, although I’m glad that taking a stand is somewhat more feasible now around these parts.
Rhi (as Klyra): I mean, honestly I don’t know which way it’s gonna break. You get these charismatic up and comers who seem like they’re gonna change everything, and then nothing does, things get worse. We’ll see.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Although the fact that they are existing means the boot on the neck must have loosened somewhat.
Rhi (as Klyra): Eh. It might be more that the cornered animal fights back. You box people in, grind them down so much that they don’t have anything to lose, they’re gonna fight like they don’t have anything to lose. You know?
Josie (as Minx): I suppose that is true.
Rhi (as Klyra): Yeah. My general impression of it is it’s more about breaking the union than making more money, but building that tenement also wasn’t a cheap expense, so I think a lot of the other owners are waiting to see if it’s actually effective before they follow suit.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Klyra): Hopefully they won’t, because that’s gonna ruin this neighborhood.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, although it is almost depressingly typical of his lot.
Rhi (as Klyra): Oh yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Although speaking of family, is there anyone more in your life now?
[laughter]
Kim: What the fuck?
Josie: I’m generally asking, but I might flirt.
Minna: How obvious was Minx’s crush when she was 11?
Josie: I mean, it was a kid crush, so probably not subtle.
Rhi: Are you kidding me? Yeah, it was very obvious. For a second she looks a little surprised and then she just kind of grins at you.
Rhi (as Klyra): Don’t tell me you’re still carrying that torch, Ellie.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps not that torch, but I must say you are capable of lighting many, in many people.
Rhi (as Klyra): You grew up into quite the charmer. I’m actually seeing a couple people.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, good for you.
Rhi (as Klyra): Yeah. We’ve been talking about the three of us moving in together. I have the space for it.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, that’s delightful. It’s so rare to see a complete triad.
Rhi (as Klyra): Yeah, yeah. It wasn’t for a while. I was seeing the two of them, and they met and hit it off, which was a surprise but a very welcome one. It certainly made arranging things a bit easier.
Josie (as Minx): I am genuinely and utterly happy for you.
Rhi (as Klyra): Thank you. And how about you? You have anybody special?
Josie (as Minx): Well, Nyryx and I have shared some time together, off and on, over the past while. You remember Nyryx, yes?
Rhi (as Klyra): Oh, yeah, Nyryx! She’s doing well?
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. She’s stable and happy as far as I can tell.
Rhi (as Klyra): Oh, that’s good. Who was, uh… [snaps] the other one you used to run with?
Josie (as Minx): Bazso?
Rhi (as Klyra): Yeah! He’s in charge of some gang up in Crow’s Foot now, right? The Lampblacks?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah… Indeed.
Josie: Minx will sip.
Rhi: She kind of looks at Minx.
Rhi (as Klyra): Ah… All right. Well, I’m glad to hear that you and Nyryx are doing well.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. We’ll see where it goes. We can’t seem to stay together but we can’t seem to stay apart either.
Rhi: She just kind of reaches out and pats your hand.
Rhi (as Klyra): I’m sure you two will figure it out.
Josie: You two crazy kids.
Rhi: Basically. I guess if there’s any other follow-up questions you wanted to ask, that ended up mostly being about… [laughs]
Josie: Yeah. I mean, you can’t drop that stuff and expect me not to go for it.
Rhi: It was very good.
Josie: I’m trying to figure out if there’s any personal quirks about Wott that we can exploit, or if he is just so dreadfully typical of a factory owner.
Rhi: I think what you get… You spend a while chatting with Klyra. You also learn, when you do manage to steal the conversation back around to Wott, he’s a bit of a risk-taker in terms of his business. He’s made some gambles with investments and things. He has had some pretty substantial losses, but he generally feels like he can take those risks and do okay. This has made him fairly arrogant. He tries to spend as little time in Coalridge as possible. He doesn’t like it. He thinks it is dirty and beneath him. He tends to spend most of his time either at his home in Nightmarket or at his brother’s estate in Brightstone.
Josie: I see. Although Nightmarket, that might be something we can use. All right. Yeah, I think that’s what I wanted out of this.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire and Myra, what do you two want to investigate ,either together or separately?
Kim: Hmm. Do you want to do it together, Minna?
Minna: We could do it together.
Kim: Okay. We just gotta figure out what to do.
Minna: Yeah. I don’t know why I’m so lost all of a sudden. I fucking came up with this idea. [laughs]
Kim: Well I’m lost all the time, so welcome to the club, buddy.
Rhi: [laughs] You could follow up with some of the union folks.
Kim: I was thinking about that. Yeah.
Minna: Yes, and see what might help them.
Rhi: Okay. The current leader of the unionization movement is a Skovlan factory worker named Belle Brogan.
Kim: Any relation to Harvale?
Rhi: You’re not sure.
Kim: Huh. Okay.
Rhi: You don’t know that Harvale’s from these parts though.
Minna: Huh.
Kim: Possible.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re not sure if they’re related, maybe it’s just a more common last name, who knows.
Kim: I was just curious.
Rhi: I mean, maybe you’ll find out.
Minna: Yeah, I think going to her might not be a bad idea.
Rhi: Or at least trying to. She’s not the… [laughs]
Minna: Yeah, trying to find her.
Rhi: Yeah. A lot of people try to make attempts on her life.
Minna: We have met somebody that might low-key be friends with her. I don’t know. Ulf? We had that one two-scores night with him.
Josie: Wow, going way back.
Minna: Fellow Skovlan rabble-rouser.
Rhi: Yeah, well… If you’ll recall, that night didn’t go super well for him.
Minna: Oh, it didn’t go well for him? Oh, you’re right.
Rhi: It did not go great.
Minna: Okay. So, gotta think about it…
Rhi: You could go back to Briggs and see if he can put you in contact. You could talk to Teagan and see if she knows somebody who could get you a meeting.
Minna: I’m sure Briggs would also know her, because I’m sure she would buy info from him.
Rhi: Yeah. That was kind of one of the things that he said, the reason this is impacting his work is…
Minna: I think we could get him to get us a meeting.
Kim: Yeah, he might have more reach as well. Let’s use him.
Rhi: Okay. I’m gonna do a fortune roll to see how much success he has in getting in contact with her. Okay, 6, after I rerolled the die because it fell off my desk. If the two of you go back and say hey, we would like to talk to Belle Brogan, he is immediately like okay, yeah, give me a few hours, and is able to arrange a meeting. Briggs manages to arrange this meeting and it’s in the area of Coalridge known as Brickston, which is kind of the residential area. It’s this very densely packed tangled maze of buildings that have had additions tacked onto the sides and the top, and things are leaning over, and then there are the remnants of rail lines, and there’s junk piled up everywhere. You are given a specific alleyway to go to.
Kim: Oh good.
Rhi: The two of you walk into this alley, and it looks like it’s the setup for an ambush.
Kim: Oh…
Rhi: Somewhat unsurprisingly, after the two of you have been there for a couple minutes, both ends of the alley are blocked off by three people on each side, and then from one side a fourth figure steps past and walks up to the two of you. She is indeed a Skovlan woman, early 40s, short and stocky, very muscular. She’s got a lot of scars on her hands and her forearms, and she has one hand resting on the grip of her pistol as she walks up to the two of you.
Rhi (as Belle): All right. Who the hell are you two?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Minna (as Myra): We’re people who would like to help you.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm!
Rhi (as Belle): Do you have names?
Minna (as Myra): Myra.
Kim (as Blaire): Blaire.
Minna (as Myra): We’re with The Magpies.
Rhi: Her eyes widen a little bit.
Rhi (as Belle): All right. Well… That rather changes the tenor of this conversation.
Minna (as Myra): Would you like to tell us which way it changes that tenor?
Rhi (as Belle): Well, I don’t doubt that you’re genuine, you seem pretty impressive, but you also seem to be lacking in subtlety. Right now with a lot of my people held hostage I sort of need subtle.
Minna (as Myra): We can do subtle.
Rhi: She raises an eyebrow.
Rhi (as Belle): What are you looking to do?
Minna (as Myra): We’re looking to find out, I suppose, what kind of help would benefit you in terms of helping out those hostages? Because that’s what we’re here to do.
Rhi (as Belle): Huh, all right.
Rhi: I feel like you’re gonna need a roll at this point.
Minna: I now have three in Consort.
Rhi: Ooh.
Minna: That is a 6.
Kim: Ooh!
Rhi (as Belle): I’ve been trying to figure out an angle on Wott, the factory owner. He borrowed his money from someone. He didn’t have the funding to pay for the tenement himself. Finding out who he got that money from could be a potential in. They’ve done a number on a lot of my people, my resources are fairly limited right now.
Minna (as Myra): And you have no idea where he got the money?
Rhi (as Belle): I can tell you where he didn’t get it from. it wasn’t from his brother. The last few times that his brother financed his gambles things have not gone terribly well, so I don’t think that it is a legitimate line of credit. I suspect that he is borrowing from some of the well-to-do criminal organizations in the city, I’m just not sure who.
Minna (as Myra): One last question. Brogan is an interesting last name. I think I heard some buzz about that related to an Ironhook case recently. Any relation?
Rhi: [loudly rolls a die]
Josie & Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: She rolls her eyes.
Rhi (as Belle): Egh… Distant cousin. He came over around the same time, but we were never really close. He went his way and I went mine, and so far mine’s kept me out of prison.
Minna (as Myra): So far.
Rhi (as Belle): Let’s hope it stays that way. Well, if you can figure out any way of breaking Wott and getting this tenement prison broken up, that would be for the best.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. I think we’d better let everybody know what a bad investment this was.
Rhi (as Belle): Indeed.
Rhi: All right. Let me open up my book to the factions page and figure out where he would have gotten money from. Hmm… Hmm! Oh, okay, yep. I know where his money’s from.
Minna: [nervously] Oh… So how do we find this out? Hmm. We can go to The Gondoliers.
Rhi: That is a possibility.
Minna: I guess we could also ask… There’s a contact who’s a deal broker somewhere.
Rhi: Amancio!
Minna: Amancio, the deal broker. He might have heard some buzz about this. Actually, he’s more likely than The Gondoliers, because he runs in those kinds of circles.
Rhi: Yeah! We haven’t seen Amancio in a bit. All right, are the three of you gonna head over to see Amancio together?
Josie: Sure.
Minna: What ungodly tea do we drink this time? [laughs]
Rhi: I don’t know, man…
## Amancio [0:48:57]
Rhi: So you make your way up to Charterhall to Amancio’s home, and again you’re greeted at the door by a servant who rather than taking you back to the greenhouse ushers you into a sitting room area.
Rhi (as Servant): Mr. Amancio is meeting with another client right now, but he should be with you shortly.
Rhi: You’re hanging out there for about ten minutes in this nice sitting room. There’s a lot of paintings of plants and stuff on the walls and some nice sculptures. You hear footsteps in the hall and you see Amancio walking out with a person who is carrying a small satchel in their hands.
Rhi (as Amancio): So, steep it into hot water, into a tea, and you should start to notice changes in, [inhales], usually a couple months.
Rhi: The person nods and heads on out, and Amancio turns on his heel and looks at the three of you.
Rhi (as Amancio): Ah! It’s so wonderful to see you again. How have you been? It’s been so long.
Josie (as Minx): Likewise, Amancio. We’ve been well, and we’re hoping you could say the same of yourself.
Rhi (as Amancio): Oh yes! Yes, quite well, quite well indeed. Can I interest any of you in some tea?
Kim (as Blaire): No thank you.
Josie (as Minx): Absolutely.
Minna: [giggles]
Minna (as Myra): Please.
Kim: Oh. Now I’m gonna look like the rude bitch.
Minna: [laughing] Myra was the only one who enjoyed it last time.
Rhi: He gestures to the servant who heads off.
Rhi (as Amancio): I had mixed responses to the basil tea, so going with a bit more traditional…
Josie (as Minx): Yes, not everyone can have a refined pallet.
Rhi (as Amancio): [chuckles] Ah, indeed, indeed. So! What brings you here?
Josie (as Minx): It has come to our attention that a friend of ours in Charhollow may have made some investments with some other people, and he may not have known what he was getting into, and we were hoping you might know more about these potentially, potentially I say, dangerous dealers so that we might inform our friend of his bad investment.
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Josie: I’ve got some Consort going on?
Rhi: Probably.
Josie: Four.
Rhi: He kinda frowns at you for a little bit.
Rhi (as Amancio): Charhollow? Charhollow…? Bad investment… Oh. Oh… Why are you friends with Tomasz Wott?!
Minna: [bursts into laughter]
Rhi (as Amancio): When did that—That does not seem like the sort of person that you would keep company.
Josie (as Minx): Oh thank goodness. That charade does not need to be kept up. All right. Phew. No, indeed not.
Minna (as Myra): Friend was sarcasm.
Rhi (as Amancio): Ah. Oh, good. [breathes] I wasn’t involved in that deal directly, but you know how it is, people talk, rumors spread, all sorts of delicious, juicy gossip. After more reputable lenders were unwilling to help him out he turned to some of the various elicit organizations in the city and from what I understand he managed to snag a loan from those Severosi mercenaries over in Six Towers.
Minna (as Myra): The Silver Nails?

## Blooper [0:54:03]
Rhi: [laughing] I think—
Kim: [flustered] No- What I-
Rhi: I think at this point in the conversation…
Kim: Oh no~! I was gonna go into a really great point about how some ghosts are emo and some are punk rock and some are pop punk and some are ska and…
[laughter]
Minna: You realize Rhi would have to cut that for the blooper reel anyway.
Kim: There’s more than just goth!
Rhi: Yeah! It—[words dissolve to laughter]
Josie: Just a fucking checkerboard pattern ghost, a ska ghost.

Next, Minna is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Minna: Equality Florida is a statewide civil rights organization dedicated to securing full equality for Florida’s LGBTQ community. Through education, grassroots organization, coalition building and lobbying, they’re changing Florida so that no one suffers harassment or discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Their goals include passing LGBTQ protections at the municipal level, passing a statewide nondiscrimination law, passing a statewide anti-bullying law, passing legislation to protect the transgender community, and changing public opinion in the state of Florida regarding LGBT individuals and families. They work on advocacy in Tallahassee as well as education in local communities, and they need help to do so. If you would like to donate, please go to eqfl.org. Thank you.
Rhi: As always, please continue to visit 5calls.org and call your representatives. As the Democrats in the House open up more and more investigations into the Trump administration we will need to keep up the pressure on GOP lawmakers in both chambers to hold the administration accountable.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:14]
Rhi (as Amancio): After more reputable lenders were unwilling to help him out he turned to some of the various elicit organizations in the city and from what I understand he managed to snag a loan from those Severosi mercenaries over in Six Towers.
Minna (as Myra): The Silver Nails?
Minna: What are The Silver Nails doing involved in this? Eghhh…
Josie: Egh…
Rhi: Well, they don’t like Skovlanders.
Josie: They don’t?
Rhi: They don’t.
Minna: Oh. So they’re just doing this to be dicks to Skovlanders?
Josie: Oh my God!
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: The racist fucks.
Kim: Geez.
Minna: Gross.
Rhi: Also, they’re seeing a potential for profit. They need funding and they’re pretty well-off.
Minna: Mmm.
Josie (as Minx): That does track, although it seems unusually spiteful even for them.
Rhi (as Amancio): Eh, petty but profitable. That is one of the main things that makes this city turn.
Josie (as Minx): Quite, but rare individuals such as ourselves are above that sort of thing.
Rhi (as Amancio): Speak for yourself, darling.
Rhi: He takes a sip of tea.
Josie & Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: So yeah, if you’ve got follow-up questions you can ask a few on a 4.
Minna: I wonder what kind of term he was supposed to pay it off in.
Rhi (as Amancio): he’s quite wealthy. They probably saw quite an opportunity for profit.
Josie (as Minx): Right, and his window to pay it back was probably not…
Rhi (as Amancio): Not generous, no.
Minna (as Myra): So if we’re able to show them that he will not be able to pay it off anytime soon…
Josie (as Minx): The Silver Nails aren’t one to take something like that lying down.
Rhi (as Amancio): No.
Josie: Also, has our tea arrived yet?
Rhi: Oh yeah.
Josie: What is the tea?
Rhi: Mint. It’s a nice mint tea.
Kim: Aw…
Minna: Oh, so it’s actually a nice one that we would drink.
Rhi: The servant did bring one for Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Yay, thank you.
Josie: Aww!
Rhi: She wasn’t really paying attention when Blaire said no thank you.
Kim: Now she gets good tea. It all works out.
Josie (as Minx): Also, this is mint? Delightful.
Rhi (as Amancio): Isn’t it? It has that cooling, clean feeling. Ah, it’s very good. I’m going to try to grow a few more plants.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I think you might come by some amount of success by this one.
Rhi: You all chat for a bit while finishing your tea and then he sees you out. So, what are you all thinking?
Josie: There’s a couple ways we can go about this. We can go at it from his angle, go at it from The Silver Nails’ angle, and either try to convince them or con him such that he can’t pay back.
Rhi: Right. In leverage, the standard approach here…
Josie: [laughs] Okay!
Minna: Thank you.
Rhi: …is to come up with another investment opportunity that he needs to put basically all of his money into.
Josie: Right.
Minna: What if it’s a non-Duskwall investment scheme, so if everything in Duskwall goes south, which it’s looking like it could…
Kim: Maybe Tycheros, that’s far away enough.
Minna: And you are Tycherosi. [laughs]
Kim: I am. I could be a Tycherosi ambassador!
Josie: Ooh!
Minna: [giggles, smiling] A Tycherosi business woman, with an investment opportunity.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Oh my God. That would be so fun.
Kim (as Blaire): Do I have a deal for you!
Josie: Yes!
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Tycherosi stocks are hot right now! [laughter] And the market’s only going to go up.
Josie: And even demons know, even demons know.
Kim (as Blaire): Even demons know!
[laughter]
Rhi: [fighting laughter] Oh God! I’m just picturing that stupid meme – Blaire slaps the roof of a car, “you can fit 18 ghosts in here!”
[laughter]
Kim: This bad boy can fit 20 ghosts!
Josie: I’m in love with this plan, actually.
Kim: I like this.
Josie: I want to see Blaire try to be commanding and shrewd. My plan is to be her secretary or whatever, like Myra was for me in that other plan, and then just throw an assist at her every action.
Kim: [gasps] Can we? Can we?!
Rhi: Yes! If this is what you guys want to do, let’s do it. This sounds great.
Minna: Ultimately one of us could be the lawyer brokering, laying out all the papers, laying out the real case.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Right. You can be the lawyer, I’ll be like the personal assistant.
Kim: I will be the prodigy ambassador.
Josie: And we need to get Blaire fitted for a very small suit.
Rhi: [giggles] Blaire can be here representing her parents’ business or something, that they’re trying to get investors in.
Kim: Ah…
Rhi: Oh. I guess my question is, what kind of business are you gonna be representing here?
Kim: I probably can’t use my parents’ real business.
Rhi: No, that’s not nearly big enough.
Kim: Which is too bad, because I just came up with a perfect name for that. It has alliteration!
Rhi: Ooh?
Kim: Culhane Curiosities.
Rhi: Oh, that’s real good!
Minna: Augh~
Kim: What about things that every imperialist wants, spices?
Rhi: Oh yeah.
Kim: Tycherosi spices.
Minna: Ooh.
Rhi: Yeah. Done. That’s a really good, classic imperial thing.
Kim: It would get his attention.
Josie: And you get to say “he who controls the spice controls the worlds” at him.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Hmm! True, true.
Rhi: For a Social plan the detail is your social connection. How are you getting an introduction to this guy?
Kim: That’s a good question.
Rhi: Amancio does know of him and is in the right social circles for that.
Josie: Yeah, let’s ask him.
Minna: Would he do it without some kind of payment, or do we need to pay him for this service?
Josie: Yeah, I mean, it depends what he asks for, I guess.
Rhi: Yeah. Normally you guys just go to Amancio asking for information, and Amancio likes to talk to people, so that he will do for free, but I think if you are actually asking him to do his job…
Minna: Yeah, I was gonna say.
Rhi: …yeah, that is going to… I’ll say, he gives you all a friendly discount and it’s only 2 coin.
Josie: Okay.
Kim: That’s fair.
Rhi: Yeah. Let’s talk about the engagement roll. I think you’re sitting at 3d6 for this one.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: The mystery thing that I’ve been subtracting one die for didn’t happen this time.
Minna: Oh. I forgot there’s something in the background that you’re being mysterious and ominous about.
Rhi: Someday you’ll figure it out, or it will blow up in your faces.
Josie: Probably that one.
Rhi: Okay, that’s a 3, a 4, and a 6. With a 6 you’re in a controlled position when we start off. We start in a very nice study in a fine townhome. The study is done up mostly in shades of off-white and blue. The primary metal used is gold. It’s very nice, very tasteful. The three of you are sitting on a couch together. Please explain what you’re wearing, how you’re looking, how you’re presenting yourselves, what role each of you is playing in this scene. Let’s start with Myra.
Minna: Myra is probably wearing a very sharp pantsuit, if we’re being real here.
Rhi: Does she have glasses?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Excellent.
Minna: The lenses aren’t real, though.
Rhi: Oh yeah, no, obviously not! [laughs] But there’s a look. And, Minx?
Josie: Minx is actually femming it up a little bit more than usual even. She’s wearing a dress, not a fancy ball dress or anything but a dress, some bright, clean earthy tones. She’s got a little ledger that she keeps checking and writing nonsense in to look like she’s busy.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Her hair is back in a bun as usual. She in general is… She’s never going to stop smiling at all, but she is also going to act super deferent to Blaire.
Kim: This is so cute.
Josie: Supposed to be like a personal assistant but almost treating her like royalty a little bit, like pulling on some courtly traditions but being on the other side of it this time.
Rhi: [smiling] yeah. Alright, and Blaire?
Kim: Blaire cleans up really good, you guys.
Minna: Eee!
Josie: Yeah she does!
Kim: She is almost unrecognizable. She doesn’t have anything on her face so you can actually kind of see her eyes for once. Her hair is brushed, and she is wearing a very tailored three-piece suit with a bowtie.
[gasps]
Josie: [squeaks] That’s so good.
Rhi: [weakly] Oh my God… That’s very good.
Kim: She has not looked this good probably since she’s been in school.
Minna: Not even at the art heist?
Kim: Oh, no. I take it back. That’s true. She probably cleaned up for the art heist. Never mind.
Rhi: Yeah, but that’s probably the last time that she got dressed up.
Kim: Yes.
Josie: Also, what is your cover name?
Kim: I was just brainstorming that. My cover name is Lyra Langdon.
Rhi: [whispering] yes!
Josie: Miss Langdon, that’s perfect.
Kim: I do need to think of a name of some kind of business or fake spice that I’m trying to advertise here though. That’s the last thing I’m stuck on.
Rhi: So, the business you could go very simple, like Langdon Imports.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: You’re here representing your parents’ business. Let’s think about some kind of spice…
Kim: What if we took a real world spice and threw it into an anagram maker, and then we can advertise that as a Tycherosi spice?
Rhi: Love it.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Honestly, cumarin sounds pretty good.
Kim: I’m kind of into cumarin.
Rhi: Cumarin. Okay, that’ll be it, cumarin spice.
Kim: I specialize in cumarin.
Rhi: You’re sitting on this couch, you have some papers arrayed in front of you, and sitting across this table from you in an armchair is Tomasz Wott. He is also in a very finely tailored suit, fairly typical Akorosian features, light skin, dark hair, light eyes, full beard, and he’s kind of looking through some of the papers.
Rhi (as Wott): Well, this is certainly a very interesting proposition here. A 50% ownership is quite generous.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, as you know, cumarin doesn’t sell very well over in Tycheros because it’s actually quite common. My parents are looking for overseas investors who can, you know, help raise their income.
Rhi (as Wott): Huh. Yes, I see.
Josie: Minx is taking notes the whole time.
Rhi (as Wott): I notice that your papers here are a little light on numbers. There’s not really any specific asks for how much you’re seeking for an investor. Now, I assume at 50% ownership that it’s going to be quite substantial, but what were you thinking?
Kim (as Blaire): I’m just gonna give it to you straight, Mr. Wott. We’re looking to start at 20 coin.
Rhi: Give me a Sway.
Kim: [nervously, smiling] Oh boy.
Josie: Minx is gonna make a show of running numbers on her notepad and try to throw in an assist.
Kim: Can I do assist and push myself?
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: Oh hell yeah… Four.
Rhi: Four, okay. It’s not bad, and you’re in a controlled position. On a 4 you hesitate, so you either can withdraw and try a different approach or there’s a minor consequence. What you see—and then you can kind of decide how Blaire reacts to this—is you say 20 coin and he recoils back into his chair like you just brandished a knife at him.
Kim: Oh boy.
Rhi: That was way more money than he was expecting.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, of course that is just a quote. We are open to negotiations.
Rhi (as Wott): I should hope so.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re obviously thinking best case scenario in an ideal partnership, but we know that’s not always possible.
Rhi (as Wott): I have to ask, if you’re looking for outside investors to take over half the company and you’re asking that kind of money, I can only assume that it means that your parents’ company is not doing well. Do you have financial statements available that I could review? I would need to know what sort of… I do not want to find myself tied to a collapsing business.
Minna: Can I do a flashback that I have prepared such financial statements?
Kim: Thank God! Yes!
Rhi: Yeah. That is not gonna cost you any stress. That is exactly the kind of thing that you would have prepped for this.
Minna: I’m used to forging.
Rhi: Yeah. You don’t have to make this look like anybody else’s handwriting or anything, you just put together some financials.
Minna: I think they’re decent financial statements.
Kim: Yeah, it’s not like a failing business.
Minna: Not a failing business, and not one that’s making money hand over fist, if that makes sense, but a good business prospect.
Rhi: Yeah. They’re solid, but…
Minna: Steady.
Rhi: Yeah. Their last few years their profits have kind of plateaued, they’re not really seeing the kind of growth that you want…
Minna: But they’re looking for that growth overseas.
Rhi: Yes. Myra, are you gonna hand over these papers?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. Do you want to do a group Sway here for this? Or maybe Myra will assist Blaire? I think there’s gonna need to be another roll.
Kim: I’d be comfortable with a group.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah. I don’t know who has stress to spare. I only have 3 stress right now.
Kim: Oh, I totally have stress to spare. I can lead it.
Minna: Okay!
Rhi: Everybody roll Sway, which everyone is at least skilled in, so this should be…
Josie: I got a 5.
Kim: I also got a 5.
Minna: I also got a 5. [laughs]
Josie: Hurray.
Kim: Cool.
Minna: Solidly 5!
Rhi: A 5~! So, he takes the papers that Myra hands him and pages through, nods a little.
Rhi (as Wott): Well, you’re certainly not struggling, but also I can see there’s not a lot of growth here. That is still quite a steep investment. I think I’m going to need to… I’ve recently done some expansions at my factories here that has required some additional expenditures, and until I’ve earned that back…
Minna (as Myra): If I may?
Rhi (as Wott): Yes?
Minna (as Myra): Something that the Langdons had considered is an exchange of some stock in your company to take down the price in coin, so to speak.
Rhi (as Wott): Hmm. Well, depending on how much coin you were willing to come down I might consider it, but I think that I’m going to need to take a few days to discuss this with some of my people.
Minna (as Myra): Mr. Wott, I’m afraid we can’t give you the time that you would like. We only have this one night in Duskwall to make these offers and we have received an offer already from Collin Lisle, so I’m afraid that if you’re not interested—
Rhi (as Wott): Lisle? Really?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes. You know him?
Rhi (as Wott): Yeah. He runs another one of the factories. He’s a terrible businessman. You do not want to get involved with Lisle. Ugh…
Minna (as Myra): Then convince us.
Kim (as Blaire): You have proof of his poor business practices?
Rhi (as Wott): Ugh. I don’t, but anyone… I mean, did you investigate his financials at all? From what I understand he’s not doing well and he’s just terribly uncultured.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, while it was a less pleasant meeting there is a reason we are here now after all.
Rhi (as Wott): What was his offer?
Kim (as Blaire): He offered us 15 coin.
Rhi (as Wott): I didn’t know he had that kind of… liquid cash sitting around. Ugh.
Minna (as Myra): Seems that Lisle has been keeping secrets from you then.
Rhi (as Wott): Ugh. Apparently. What do you need the coin upfront for anyway?
Kim (as Blaire): More ships so we can put out more shipments, more labor so we can farm out more spice, manifests, receiving, docks… none of that comes cheap.
Rhi: After your list of items, give me another roll, and it can be another group roll if you all would like since you’ve all have kind of been…
Minna: yes. Are we allowed to push ourselves during this?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Okay. I’m gonna do that.
Josie: I’ve got a 5.
Kim: Three.
Minna: Three! Gosh darn it.
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: Okay. Whoever’s leading is gonna take 2 stress.
Rhi (as Wott): That does all make a lot of sense. It might be better sense for me to… We can sign the agreement and everything. I can set aside the funds that we agree to in a separate account, and I could handle a lot of the setup on this side of things to ensure that you don’t have to make that lengthy trip back and forth quite as often and oversee some of the business here, which would make sense since it is a partial ownership of the company.
Minna (as Myra): Of course. If we could establish an account under Langdon Imports, which we will of course joint own, I believe that would be acceptable to both parties.
Rhi: Myra, give me one more roll to see if he bites on this.
Minna: is this Sway or can it be Consort, because we’re making a deal?
Kim: We are lying to him though.
Rhi: You are not being… You are lying like a rug.
Josie: Can I assist by taking some separate forms out of my ledger and scribbling like I’m setting up the paperwork for it right now?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Take an extra die.
Rhi: Can I interest you in a Devil’s Bargain?
Minna: What does the Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: The person who helps you set this up, like sets up the account and the business stuff, and you’re gonna have to pick a contact, it can be one of Myra’s contacts or a crew contact, whoever helped you set that up is basically going to tap them out in terms of favors for a while. They’re not going to be able or willing to help you for a while.
Minna: I mean, it makes a lot of sense for it to be Amancio, but I don’t know how you guys feel about that.
Kim: No, I’m okay with that.
Josie: Yeah. We asked a lot of him already this time.
Rhi: Yeah, and just this whole hey, by the way, I need you to help me setup a fake corporation with a fake bank account? He was like okay, I will do this for you, because I like you people, but please don’t ask me like this, I cannot do this kind of work for you for a while.
Minna: Six!
Rhi: Okay! He kind of thinks about it for a little bit.
Rhi (as Wott): That makes sense. It seems reasonable. You’re expecting to see these profits turn around fairly quickly, I assume?
Minna (as Myra): Yes. We already have shipments on the way. We should be selling them within I’d say a month or two.
Rhi (as Wott): Eh… What’s the worst that could happen, right?
Rhi: He reaches across the table to shake Blaire’s hand.
Kim: She takes his hand to shake and flashes him a big grin.
Kim (as Blaire): Mr. Wott, pleasure doing business with you.
Rhi: [chuckles] We see the four of you in a bank office. It’s very fancy. The banker who’s signing these agreements keeps looking Wott a little worried, and a couple times he’s like:
Rhi (as Banker): Sir, are you sure about this?
Rhi (as Wott): Yes, yes, yes. It’s fine. This is going to be very profitable. Carry on with it.
Minna: How much coin was it again? It was more than 15?
Rhi: It was more than 15. I think with the amount of successes that happened, I think it’s gonna be 16 coin is what he put in there.
Josie: Wait. We need to make this money vanish, right? Does that mean we’re getting fucking…
Rhi: If you want to keep all of it, yeah. Now, the question is do you want to keep all of it?
Josie: I imagine there might be consequences to us keeping all of it.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: We could invest some of it into things we believe in, such as—
Rhi: Yeah. We’ll get to that. So, the forms are all signed, there’s shaking of hands, he heads off, and he moved it from his bank account to your bank account, and now you have to get it out of that account.
Josie: Right. We could, I don’t know, we have various businesses we’re associated with. We could just arrange transfers to all of them to make it look like it’s business expenses or something.
Minna: Ooh, yeah.
Rhi: Okay. What businesses are you thinking?
Josie: I don’t know. Maybe some funds go to The Hound’s paw, maybe some go to The Weeping Lady.
Rhi: [laughing] Jesus. You’re laundering money through Rigney’s business.
Josie: Yeah, but like…
Minna: We also have a collector friend.
Josie: Right. We can send it to a bunch of the people in Charhollow. We might as well send some towards some business on The Docks in Phin’s honor or something.
Kim: We could send some to Seeks.
Rhi: Yeah, okay, okay. I think this is gonna require a flashback to setup.
Josie: I will do this one.
Rhi: Yeah, basically to just sort of arrange with all of these people, that hey we’re gonna be giving you all a shitload of money…
Josie: Uh-huh. I’m gonna make sure Teagan gets some. I’m gonna make sure some to Teagan, and Brigs…
Kim: I was gonna say, Teagan should get some.
Rhi: Teagan does not have a bank account. I think basically what this is gonna be is he gives you all the money, you transfer it out to six different accounts of people who you do know, and then collect it all back from them or most of it.
Kim: Do her dads have a bank account?
Rhi: No, they’re too poor.
Minna: We could still pay out some of it to her.
Josie: What is a reasonable amount for us to come back with each?
Rhi: First, Minx, you’re gonna take 2 stress. That’s a lot to arrange all that. I think some of these people you’re asking are gonna require a cut. Fitz is gonna take a coin. You all probably give Rigney some money.
Josie: No, I don’t want to take any from Rigney. I want The Hound’s Paw to receive its portion.
Rhi: Okay. You got 16 coin. After it gets funneled through all these things and people take their cuts, it comes back where you all have 10 coin.
Josie: Phew.
Rhi: But that is not money that you would be distributing. That’s not including a cut that would go to Teagan or other people who don’t have accounts.
Josie: Maybe 4 in the vault, 2 for each of us?
Kim: That sounds fair.
Rhi: So you’re not gonna be distributing any of that money out?
Minna: I mean, I can definitely distribute a coin to Teagan.
Kim: Oh yeah, so can I.
Josie: Oh yeah. You know what, let’s just each give her a coin. [laughs] Why not?
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Oh no, I want to send my coin to Brigs, actually. I want to make sure he gets some.
Rhi: It will end up being 1 coin for each of you, 4 in the vault. Does that sound right?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re making a lot of charitable donations.
Josie: We’re not thieves anymore, but this is by far the biggest payout.
Rhi: Yeah, well you conned a rich dude.
Josie: This is some Robin Hood shit.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Now I would say the last thing that you need to do here, you’ve gotten this huge pile of money, and now you need The Silver Nails to ask for their money back.
Josie: Yeah…
Kim: How do we do that?
Rhi: Honestly, I think if one of you just like…
Minna: Yeah, I’d like to roll up.
Rhi: yeah. You have a prior relationship with them.
Minna: Myra goes to The Mustang and asks for Sazari.
Rhi: You have to wait in the lobby of The Mustang for a few minutes, and then Sazari rounds the corner and comes in and sees you, and immediately starts shaking their head.
Rhi (as Sazari): We’re not taking you back there. I’m sorry. We are not getting you into The Deathlands again. That was…
Minna (as Myra): Oh, we have no interest in The Deathlands.
Rhi (as Sazari): [relieved] Oh, good.
Minna (as Myra): Our business is city bound.
Rhi (as Sazari): Good. There was a lot of fire.
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): This time there’s not fire.
Rhi (as Sazari): What do you need?
Minna (as Myra): We’ve been hearing about a short term loan you gave out to Tomasz Wott.
Rhi (as Sazari): How did You hear about that?
Minna (as Myra): It’s a very long story. I’m willing to tell it to you later, but the long and short of it is if you could call that in we would consider that a favor.
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Minna: Is that a Consort?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Five.
Rhi: Okay. They stare at you for a few long minutes.
Rhi (as Sazari): Okay, but we are going to hold you to that favor.
Minna (as Myra): Of course. I expected nothing else.
Rhi (as Sazari): And depending on how this goes with Wott, it could be a pretty big favor.
Minna (as Myra): I’m willing to risk it. Are you?
Rhi (as Sazari): Well, I don’t seem to have much of a choice. Yeah, we can make that happen.
Minna: I think they shake hands.
Rhi: Yeah, they shake hands ,nod.
Minna (as Myra): Let me know when you want me to come back and tell you that story and we can work out the details.
Rhi (as Sazari): Heh. Yeah, we’ll be in touch.
## Downtime [0:29:20]
Rhi: Let’s go into downtime… which I realized recently – I was looking through the Vigilante’s book – I have actually been doing that wrong for you guys, a little bit. For reputation and coin it works a little differently for Vigilantes. You are supposed to get more rep. You earn rep as if you earn coin.
Kim: Oh. Okay.
Rhi: You earn rep based on the nature of the operation and who you impressed. So, I’m gonna say, based on this, I’m not gonna give you any additional coin. You have already earned a lot. I’m gonna say you’re gonna get 6 rep, which is retribution for a major score, several citizens avenged. You’re not necessarily avenging people, but I think that’s pretty significant.
Josie: It helped a lot of people.
Kim: Several citizens righted by justice.
Rhi: Yeah. Several wrongs righted. Yeah, that gets you a lot of rep.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: And… Lookouts.
Josie: Oh right! We got that.
Minna: Yeah! [laughs] That’s what this was all about. We just happened to – into the bargain – take down an asshole.
Rhi: Let’s do the rest of downtime, which means next is gonna be heat. I don’t actually know if you’re gonna take any heat on this one.
Minna: It wasn’t super obviously us, except two people that we care that we liked.
Rhi: Yeah. This was really quiet.
Minna: [laughs] We can do it occasionally.
Rhi: Also, you all have started off this season with a lot of very high risk, dangerous scores. This is kind of how Blades is supposed to work where you do a big dangerous score and then you do a couple calmer ones to recover, and then you do another big one. You all just lurch from one dangerous score to another.
[laughter]
Kim: That’s how we are.
Rhi: Yep. That’s how you do.
Josie: Because that’s good radio.
Rhi: Let’s see what everybody gets up to in downtime. Let’s start with Minx. What do you do while everyone’s waiting for news on this con?
Josie: Minx is gonna approach Blaire.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire dear, somewhat of an awkward question, but getting right to the point: What is the spookiest place in the city you know people go to mingle?
Kim (as Blaire): The spookiest to mingle?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I imagine there are others who share your predilections.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… I mean, yeah. I guess it depends. What variety of spooky are you looking to get into?
Josie (as Minx): Well, it’s not so much what I am looking to get into, but you know, strange artefacts, with an E, that sort of thing.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay. I know a guy. He can probably get you setup.
Josie (as Minx): Oh? I’m not actually looking for said artefacts, I just am looking to—
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, he can get you into the social circle is the thing. He would probably know more about it than I do.
Josie (as Minx): That would be much appreciated.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay!
Josie: I think something strange is gonna happen. Minx is gonna go goth.
Kim: [gasps]
Minna: What?! Why?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Tell us what Minx going goth looks like in exquisite detail.
Minna: Please.
Josie: Okay. She has a flowing black lace dress. The sleeves hang very loose so when she moves her arm there’s a dramatic sweeping motion. The upper chest area is a bit exposed with various strange trinkets and gems hanging down about a necklace, and basically a vampire collar of lace. It’s kind of like choker tightness around her neck and then flaring out when it gets up to her jaw.
Kim: Please tell me she’s wearing black lipstick.
Josie: yes.
Kim: Yes!
Josie: And eyeshadow.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yesss!
Rhi: Very good.
Josie: Minx is going full this.
Minna: I need this fan art.
Rhi: So, Dowler points you to a gathering of one of the cults of a forgotten god.
Josie: Oh no…
Rhi: The forgotten god that he sends you to is the Cult of the Dream Beyond Death.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: Their rituals involve the creation of basically sacred objects and artifacts, so they actually have a lot of artists in the group, so initially you’re really on edge, but then you start talking to some of them and there’s actually a lot of… It’s a lot of artists in this cult, so you’re actually having a really good conversation with a lot of them which is why it reduces so much stress.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Or no—This can be part of your stress relief. Yeah, you bond with them really well which is why you’re so effective in spreading your rumors. What rumors are you spreading?
Josie: I’m basically spreading that I was looking into something just called The Hand. I don’t drop Kotar. I had been trying to find it or evidence of it in The Docks, but then things went down, the fire happened, and then the Lampblacks swept in, and my assistants have since been unable to find further traces of the artifact, so I’m willing to bet that them sweeping in was not merely gang violence.
Rhi: Yeah. There’s some curious chatter about that. I think at one point you hear a couple people whispering.
Rhi (as Cultist1): She couldn’t mean the Hand of Kotar, could she?
Rhi (as Cultist2): No, that’s ridiculous.
Rhi (as Cultist1): Right?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. That rumor is percolating amongst the creepy folk of the city.
Josie: And Minx actually has a surprisingly good time with the cult.
Rhi: Yeah. You actually kind of leave there with…
Josie: She might go back. [laughs]
Rhi: There’s some parts of it that are a little… when they start getting into some of their rituals of the consecration of things, you’re like eh this is a little spooky, but a before that a lot of it is actually a pretty fun time.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Minx has a nice time at a goth club!
Josie: Yup. [laughs]
Kim: Yay~
Minna: Tee-hee-hee.
Rhi: Myra, what do you get up to?
Minna: Oh God. I didn’t even think about this. [into hands] I was too caught up in goth Minx. What do I get up to?
Rhi: You could do the stress relief thing. You could go with your obligation with Jeren.
Minna: Oh, that’s true. I think she sent a message. Maybe he’s there first and she comes walking into the restaurant. He’s the one who’s not looking at the door because he always gives her the spot with the view to the door and to the window, so she surprises him a little bit.
Rhi (as Jeren): [breathy] Oh… Hi.
Minna (as Myra): Hey. How are you doing?
Rhi (as Jeren): Um… All right. I mean, I always get a little stressed when I get a note from you. Everything going okay?
Minna (as Myra): I was trying to be a better friend and actually have lunch with you when I don’t want something from you.
Rhi (as Jeren): Oh. It feels like most times when I see you now it’s after something really horrible has gone down.
Minna (as Myra): I promise you nothing terribly horrible has gone down.
Rhi (as Jeren): Just the regular kind of horrible?
Minna (as Myra): Just the regular kind of horrible, and probably not anything you’ll have to deal with.
Rhi (as Jeren): Oh, that’s good at least.
Minna (as Myra): No Bluecoats.
Rhi (as Jeren): Very good.
Minna (as Myra): [chuckles]
Rhi (as Jeren): [sighs]
Minna (as Myra): How’s work treating you? I mean, I’m sure you don’t want to talk about it, but… conversation.
Rhi (as Jeren): It’s fine…
Minna (as Myra): You’re still liking it there? I know you chose it over many other opportunities you could have had.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. Yeah, I did. I don’t know. I’m not sure. It’s… I don’t know. It’s hard having to make excuses all the time. I mean, it’s not all the time.
Minna (as Myra): Make excuses to them?
Rhi (as Jeren): To you. I feel like I’m having to defend it a lot, and…
Minna (as Myra): You knew when you met me that I didn’t very much like the authorities.
Rhi (as Jeren): Actually when I met you I thought that you were a fellow law student.
Rhi: He nudges you under the table.
Minna (as Myra): Being a scholar of political history doesn’t mean that you agree with everything that you’re reading, in fact I would say you have to be critical.
Rhi (as Jeren): I don’t know. I’m not sure that what I’m doing is the best thing anymore, but I’m also not sure what else I could do.
Minna (as Myra): Jeren, you could do so many things. You’re smart. You’ve studied. You know both what you went for your degree in and archiving library things… You have all that experience.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah… I don’t know. Let’s not worry about it right now.
Minna (as Myra): No, I don’t want to keep more worries on you.
Rhi (as Jeren): Let’s order.
Rhi: So, you guys have lunch. Jeren’s got a little bit of a question mark.
Minna: [smiling] Jeren’s got a little bit of a question mark, which is really fun.
Rhi: Starting to think about things. All right, while that is happening, what does Blaire get up to during her downtime?
Kim: That’s a really good question.
Rhi: Oh! Do you want to do annoying the hell out of The Reconciled?
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: I feel like that would be a very short vignette, but yeah, we can do that.
Rhi: If you had something else that you want to do…
Kim: No, that’s totally fine. I’m fine having it be literally me indulging my vice.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, and what about this?! If… If a ghost actually becomes, you know, is it possible that they can actually become reformed, or is it just something that happens at the get-go?
Rhi (as Karina): It’s… We do not understand the mechanisms by which people become reconciled.
Rhi: Lady Karina looks like she’s regretting ever inviting you in here.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, but like what if we did? Like, don’t you have people looking into this? I could help you look into this.
Rhi (as Karina): As I’ve said several times, we have scholars researching a number of things, but our resources are considerably limited.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, I can help, I can be one of those scholars. Where are they right now, and what are they looking into? What manner of scholars? Do they have doctorates?
Rhi (as Karina): You know, as it so happens I have another appointment who’s coming in right now, so why don’t you… visit one of the libraries and begin looking into this?
Rhi: As she’s talking she’s walking you towards the door, she takes your cloak off of a hook and hands it to you.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! You know, just send me a message when you– … Uh… Okay! I’ll be back later.
Rhi: The door shuts. [chuckles]
Kim (as Blaire): Okay… I’ll, uh, be in touch… buddy old pal.
[laughter]
Rhi: Blaire… Oh honey.
Kim (as Blaire): Best friends… Buddies… Guys…
Rhi: She’s just standing outside the door, isn’t she?
Kim: Yeah. Yeah.
Rhi: Aww.
Josie: Oh no~!
Kim: I’m allowed to come back, right?
Rhi: [laughing] The door is closed!
Kim (as Blaire): [groans]
Rhi: You’re talking to a closed door.
Kim: [laughing] Yeah, she is gonna walk away after a while.
Rhi & Josie: [smiling] Oh no…
Josie: That’s like kicking out a puppy. How can you do that?
Kim: [giggles]
Rhi: It is. I feel terrible anytime I have to be mean to Blaire, and it seems to happen so often.
[laughter]
Kim: I’m sorry I made someone so… so cute and is terrible to be mean to.
Rhi: No, don’t apologize. I love Blaire. She’s a good bean. All right, it takes a few days, but you do eventually get word, you start hearing some rumors filtering in that there was a shutdown at one of the factories in Ironhook. Work was paused while ownership of the factory was sorted out. Around that same time you get a note at The Hound’s Paw inviting you to stop back to see Briggs, so you once again reach his stall in the Charhollow market. The three of you come in and Briggs kind of cocks his head to the side.
Rhi (as Briggs): That sounds like Ellie. You got those fancy boots.
Minna (as Myra): [laughing] It is Ellie and company.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Rhi (as Briggs): Ah. Good, good, come on in. So, sounds like you all pulled off something.
Josie (as Minx): What? Us? No, it’s simply a fortunate coincidence.
Kim (as Blaire): No, that was totally us.
Josie (as Minx): I was being—Blaire, sarcasm.
Rhi: [laughing] He was just kind of like, just this flat expression at Minx, and then just nods at Blaire.
Rhi (as Briggs): They had to shut down the factory for a couple days when they figured out who owned it. Apparently the Silver Nails were making a claim that it was their property, because Wott didn’t have the funding to pay them back for the money that they were owed. I don’t believe that they did ultimately end up with control of it. I think that it ended up going to his brother who will probably hire someone to oversee the place, but the tenement ended up being shut down.
Josie (as Minx): Perfect.
Rhi (as Briggs): There was no longer money to pay for maintaining it and the guards that were keeping everyone in place, so people just left and I don’t think that it’s going to see much use. I also don’t think it’ll be standing very long, it was very shoddy construction.
Josie (as Minx): Well, hopefully someone doesn’t come knock them down then. Anyway.
Rhi (as Briggs): Hmm. Yes, well I suspect that Miss Brogan may be seeing to that.
Josie (as Minx): [chuckles] Everyone’s back home safe?
Rhi (as Briggs): Seems that way. Not everyone has checked in yet, but it’s not really a formalize system. People just sort of come to me when they have something to share. In any case, like I said, if you’d like some information passed along when you’re…
Rhi: What part of town do you want for the Lookouts?
Minna: Ooh.
Kim: Hmm.
Josie: What’s a district we work in a lot?
Rhi: I feel like your big ones are… I mean, you hit almost every district in the city except you don’t do a ton of jobs in Silkshore, Barrowcleft or Whitecrown.
Josie: Right. I almost feel like Charhollow or The Docks.
Rhi: Yeah, either of those are good.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Do you have a preference one way or another?
Minna: The Docks? We have less connections in The Docks.
Kim: Yeah, now that Phin’s gone maybe The Docks.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay.
Rhi (as Briggs): Anytime you need some extra eyes and ears up in The Docks there’s a lot of people there who were already very well inclined towards you it seemed like, and it sounds like they will be willing to help you out if you should need it.
Josie (as Minx): That means a lot. Thank you.
Rhi (as Briggs): Pleasure working with you.
Minna (as Myra): The pleasure was all ours.
Rhi (as Briggs): You should come around more often. Mallory likes you.
Rhi: The dog gets up and nudges her head under Blaire’s hand.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps]
Kim: Blaire’s gonna pet behind her ears, and she is so, so happy about it.
Rhi: [laughs]

Kim: Snarf.
Rhi: Uh, what if… What’s another…?
Kim: Arson. [laughs] Sonar… All right, saffron is out.
Rhi: Let’s try combining saffron and another spice. What’s another–?
Kim: Saffron and cumin.
Minna: That’s funny. I was also thinking cumin earlier.

And then, after we buy that audio equipment, we’ll be able to start a merch store. So, if you’d like to see Magpies t-shirts or other gear exist in the world, consider supporting us with a few dollars a month. Next, Minna is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Minna: Equality Florida is a state-wide civil rights organisation dedicated to securing full equality for Florida’s LGBTQ community. Through education, grassroots organisation, coalition-building and lobbying, they’re changing Florida so that no one suffers harassment or discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Their goals include passing LGBTQ protections at the municipal level, passing a state-wide non-discrimination law, passing a state-wide anti-bullying law, passing legislation to protect the transgender community, and changing public opinion in the state of Florida regarding LGBT individuals and families. They work on advocacy in Tallahassee as well as education in local communities, and they need help to do so. If you’d like to donate, please go to EQFL.org. Thank you.
Rhi: As always, please consider donating if you can. And continue to reach out to your elected officials. In the US, visit 5calls.org for scripts about current issues and phone numbers for your representatives.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## Story continues [00.02.04]
Rhi: So, we start off as we so often do, in The Hound’s Paw. It is mid-afternoon. The Magpies have wandered down there to hang out and see if anyone happens to need them or see if Rigney has any notes for them. Rigney is at the bar as usual. He’s just, kind of, cleaning up, pouring drinks. The bar isn’t super busy, but he’s been a little quiet and distracted today. Just seems to be focussing on his work. What are the three of you up to?
Kim: I think Blaire is just sitting there sipping her tea and doodling in her journal as usual, but I think she definitely notices Rigney’s quietness. I think she’s gonna want to investigate that at some point. Check up on him.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Minx has a little flip back notepad that she’s scribbling furiously in, and she’s kind of been doing that for the past day or so as well as-, I don’t know if, like, magazines are really a thing this world has, right?
Rhi: Um. Hmm. Yeah, yeah I think there’s, like, pamphlets and catalogues. It’s probably not, like, dedicated fashion magazines the way that we have them. But I think there’s, like, fashion catalogues.
Minna: And there could be, like, fashion plates and stuff.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: Yeah. She somewhat uncharacteristically appears to be studying and taking notes. Except it’s all fashion pamphlets and catalogues and she kind of has her food around doing that.
Minna: I think Myra is letting her companions get on with their various studies and people-watching.
Rhi: So, into this quiet afternoon-, I think it’s raining a little bit outside, it’s just kind of like a calm, quiet afternoon. The door of The Hound’s Paw swings open with a little more force than is necessary, a handful of people in the bar kind of glance up, as Kay strides in, a little bit damp and a lot grumpy.
Kim (as Blaire): Hey!
Josie (as Minx): Oh, hello dear, is everything alright?
Rhi: She, like, closes the door behind her and kind of shakes water off her hands and she comes over, and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Ah, good. You’re here. We are having problems again.
Rhi: And she, like, pulls out a chair and sits down at your table and just, kind of, rubs a hand over her forehead.
Rhi (as Kay): You remember the issue we were dealing with back when we first met, with The Circle of Flame hounding us?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. They bothering you again?
Rhi (as Kay): No, not directly. But it’s The Lampblacks, of all people, are coming around asking questions about the relics of Kotar.
Kim (as Blaire): Why?
Josie (as Minx): What?
Rhi (as Kay): Beats me. That didn’t ever seem to be their area of interest. I know that The Circle is still looking into those as well, but The Lampblacks are harassing us specifically now. So, I got sent to see if you could help again with this issue.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I for one would be glad to. We have some history with that gang.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t think Bazso’s involved with this, do you? Is it a personal interest?
Josie (as Minx): He does not seem like an occult-minded sort of person. I mean, it’s possible they have had run-ins with The Circle, what with their recent expansion.
Rhi (as Kay): Yeah, maybe.
Josie (as Minx): But I’m not certain why he would much care about what they’re looking for.
Rhi (as Kay): Yeah, well, in any case, if you can help, we just need them to back off. They’re not attacking us the way that The Circle was, you know. At least, not yet. But it’s interfering with business. They’re chasing our customers off and holding people up so that they can’t do their jobs, and it’s not unlikely that if they get desperate that they will turn to violence.
Josie (as Minx): Right, yes. We have a vested interest in seeing this resolved as much as possible. Please stay safe.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re not gonna let them hurt you.
Rhi (as Kay): I would like to see them try.
Rhi: She just gives this, like, big, shit-eating grin.
Josie: Minx swoons a little bit.
[laughter]
Minna (as Myra): Intimidating as always, Kay.
Rhi (as Kay): Anyway, I popped in because I was dropping off some customers and got lucky running into you here, so I gotta get back to my boat. But if you’re able to get The Lampblacks off our case, just come back to headquarters and we’ll make sure you get compensated for your time.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll look into it.
Rhi (as Kay): Thanks.
Rhi: And she kind of like, you know, raps the table as she stands up, and gives Rigney a wave as she leaves. And Rigney doesn’t seem to notice.
Josie: Hmm.
Kim: I’m gonna go up to Rigney.
Josie: Basically as soon as the door shuts behind Kay, Minx is like:
Josie (as Minx): Alright, well I didn’t perhaps forsee this. I think our timetable just moved up.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I suppose we need to keep in mind that everything that we do has effects now.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose. I’m not used to being relevant in this fashion.
Minna (as Myra): We’re part of the web now.
Josie (as Minx): We’re moving up in the world. And all it took was a radical change in perspective.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Don’t worry. That’s what growing up is all about.
Rhi: I think from there we’ll follow Blaire over to the bar.
Kim: Yep. She is gonna park herself up on a stool in front of Rigney and try to get his attention, like:
Kim (as Blaire): Hey.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, hey. You need another round?
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, I’m good for now. Just, you okay? You seem pretty quiet.
Rhi (as Rigney): Uh, yeah, yeah. Just feeling a little under the weather, that’s all. Don’t worry about me.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah? I mean, I’ve got stuff if you need it. You know, sinuses, or if your throat’s sore, headaches. Anything like that?
Rhi (as Rigney): Not quite. I’ll be alright, Blaire. You should get back to it. Looks like Kay was on a mission.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Well, you take care.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah.
Kim: And she’s gonna go back to the table.
Minna: Big worry.
Kim: Yeah, she likes her friend.
Minna: No, big worry Minna. From Minna.
Kim: Oh. I mean, big worry Kim. Yes.
[laughter]
Minna: Sorry. I just briefly broke.
Josie: Big worry Josie. Is that what we’re doing right now?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Apparently.
Josie: I’m lost.
Minna: Sorry!
[laughter]
Rhi: So, Blaire comes back over as, I think, the two of you are wrapping up your discussion about your newfound influence in Duskwall.
Kim (as Blaire): So, we’re starting shit, huh?
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Although now it looks like we will have to turn the corner on that pretty quickly.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. It’s weird.
Josie (as Minx): I think we need to ensure that The Lampblacks are fully occupied with The Circle, and vice versa.
Kim (as Blaire): So that they’ll leave The Gondoliers alone.
Josie (as Minx): Exactly.
Kim (as Blaire): Gotcha.
Josie (as Minx): I think we have spread many ethereal rumours and the like, but I think it’s time for something a bit more concrete to appear.
Kim (as Blaire): Like what?
Josie (as Minx): At least some solid quote unquote ‘proof’ that The Lampblacks have what we say they have.
Kim (as Blaire): So what are you suggesting? That we plant something onto The Lampblacks?
Josie (as Minx): Something of that nature. Or send something to The Circle that confirms it. That will make them go all in.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, I dunno, I don’t think we should interact with The Circle directly. Maybe planting something onto The Lampblacks and trying to get the word to pass to The Circle might be safer.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm. It’s just a matter of planting it such that The Lampblacks don’t know that is has been planted. And also, what can we fake that would be convincing enough?
Minna (as Myra): Sounds like a job for Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Well. I mean, I can fake some artefacts, or can make real artefacts, but nothing that’s of real significance or power. I’m not–
Josie (as Minx): Can you make something that seems like it’s super important and evil? Even if it doesn’t do anything.
Kim (as Blaire): Um…
Minna: You forget that-, did you say a specific relic that you think The Lampblacks have?
Josie: The Hand of Kotar, I believe.
Rhi: Yeah, The Hand.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, according to what I’ve read about it, I don’t think anybody really knows what The Hand of Kotar looks like.
Minna (as Myra): So make a spooky enough hand and they might believe it.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, if you can make, like, a corpse hand glow purple. I think that will be convincing enough.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs] Don’t be ridiculous. I can only do green.
Josie (as Minx): Ah. Well, I mean, that’s a good substitution.
Kim (as Blaire): Although… oh! Oh!
Kim: Blaire starts getting really excited. She starts, like, shaking her hands.
Rhi: Like, bouncing in her seat?
Kim: Yeah. Like, asking to be called on as if she were in class.
Josie: Blaire’s fucking adorable.
Kim: And she’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): I have an idea, I have an idea.
Josie: Minx will point at Blaire and say:
Josie (as Minx): Yes, Blaire?
Kim: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): You know who I think could help us? Someone I know from school. If they don’t have something in their collection that they would let us borrow, they would definitely know how to fake something really convincing.
Minna (as Myra): Okay, sounds like a plan.
Kim (as Blaire): I think they will still talk to me, too. They really only visited the school a couple of times, they weren’t staff or a student.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, a guest speaker, then.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): Who is this person?
Kim (as Blaire): Lord Scurlock.
Josie (as Minx): [sucks air through teeth] Well… he certainly has the right interests.
Minna (as Myra): You know Lord Scurlock?
Kim (as Blaire): Um, I wouldn’t say I know him, know him. I would say we’re just acquaintances. We’ve talked a couple times after he gave us some lectures at Charter Hall.
Josie (as Minx): I, um… alright.
Minna (as Myra): And how do we get to this Lord Scurlock? Will he let you in his front door?
Kim (as Blaire): Um, I’m sure if we knock on his estate, maybe.
Rhi: So, there is a Scurlock Manor in Six Towers. It’s kind of a crumbling old mansion. Somebody lives there. It’s not Lord Scurlock. Nobody is actually sure where Lord Surlock lives. Rumour has it that he has some kind of, like, stronghold out in the Deathlands, but nobody knows for sure. They just know that he doesn’t actually live in Six Towers. He does not live at the Scurlock Manor. Blaire’s best bet would be sending a message to Scurlock Manor.
Kim: Oh, like a handwritten letter? Okay, yeah. I can do that.
Rhi: So, I think we have a little, like, sort of, montage of Blaire writing a note
Kim: The way this looks is Blaire makes sure that she uses her finest stationery, she makes sure that her handwriting is as neat as possible, and she finishes off with a wax seal. Because she knows Lord Scurlock is all about presentation.
Rhi: What does her seal look like?
Blaire: It is her personal sigil, the same one that is on the forehead of her spirit mask. I have drawn it. It’s hard for me to describe, it’s basically like a sigil of, you know, shapes.
Rhi: So, just like, it’s very geometric.
Kim: Yeah, it’s a very geometric design.
Josie: Minx approves of your branding.
Rhi: So I think that, you know, we see, kind of, this shot of Blaire handing this letter to a cipher while the rain is coming down, and then it sort of fades to a different day. It’s not raining anymore. It’s not any brighter out, but there’s a little bit of fog as a cipher hands a letter back to Blaire that is also on very fine stationery and sealed with a wax seal that is just very simple, there’s no, like, coat of arms or anything, it’s just a serif-font S. And so you open up the letter. It just says, ‘Scurlock Manor’, and then a date and a time that’s, like, two hours from now.
Kim: Right. Blaire is going to slam that onto the table and just look at both of you very intently, and just:
Kim (as Blaire): We have to go. We have to go now.
Josie (as Minx): Uh, alright dear.
Kim (as Blaire): Scurlock Manor, two hours. We have to go. We have to go! Come on!
Josie (as Minx): Alright. I already have a bad feeling about this.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Come on!
Kim: She’s gonna take Minx’s wrist.
Josie (as Minx): Ahh!
Minna (as Myra): Alright, alright, we’ll go.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re going! Bye Rigney!
Rhi: Rigney just kind of gives you, like, a small wave as your barrel out the door.
Kim: She is so excited, you guys. You have no idea. Because I don’t think she’s seen his estate.
Rhi: No.
Kim: No.
Rhi: Let me think. Oh, that was what I was gonna ask. Are you stopping off at home to change clothes and like, get properly dressed before going over.
Kim: Ah shit, I probably should.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: You’ve got, yeah, you have time.
Kim: We have time.
Rhi: It’s not gonna take you two hours to get from The Hound’s Paw to–
Josie: I kind of like the idea that Minx puts us on a little bit of a time constraint, because I take a long time picking out the right outfit.
Kim: Speedrun your makeup routine, I believe in you.
[laughter]
Rhi: So you all like rush back to The Nest and then 90 minutes later Blaire is just outside Minx’s door freaking out.
Kim (as Blaire): Come on! I’m already ready!
Kim: And like, her hair is done, she’s in her suit that she wears for fancy scores, no mess on her face. Cleaned up, basically.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Minx comes out in her formal outfit, with like the shoulder cape. Due to his interests, I guess, she’s dressing a little darker. Blacks and the like.
Rhi: Nice.
Josie: And she emerges and says:
Josie (as Minx): Relax, dear. This is a short notice dress-up.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think he’ll like that?
Josie (as Minx): If his reputation rings true, I think so.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. I just, I don’t want it to come across like you’re trying too hard, you know? Like, you’re trying to appeal to, you know, his whole aesthetic. I think you’re good.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, you have not seen me try too hard.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Myra comes up and joins them.
Minna (as Myra): I think Minx fits in admirably with the rest of us.
Minna: Because I assume they’re all in black.
Kim: Yeah. Yeah, I guess they are.
Rhi: So I think from there we see the three of you head out and make your way up to Scurlock Manor. It’s a big mansion that was clearly once a very fine estate. It has not fallen into ruin, but it has definitely not been well maintained. There are some boarded over windows. Man, it’s hard to think of how to quickly-, because overgrown plants is like the shorthand for something being left unattended, but there wouldn’t be plants growing.
Kim: But there’s no sun.
Rhi: Oh, you know what there are, though? There’s a whole lot of mushrooms just, kind of, growing wild.
Kim: I imagine the gates to the estate, there are probably cobwebs in some crevices.
Rhi: Ooh, yeah.
Kim: Some spiders have definitely made their home here.
Rhi: Yes, yeah. And most of the other, like, when you’re up in Brightstone, or even some of the other few remaining noble homes in Six Towers, most of them have, like, lamps out at the front gate, so it’s a little easier to get to the door. There’s no lights, kind of, leading up to the mansion. And there’s only lights visible in, like, one upstairs room as you all approach the front door. It’s a little eerie. Things just seem kind of like, as you get closer, the normal sounds of the city seem to get a little muffled. Everything feels just a little off. At least to Minx and Myra. Blaire, I don’t know.
Kim: Um, yeah, no, this doesn’t intimidate her too much.
Minna (as Myra): Do you know how he does that?
Kim (as Blaire): Does what?
Minna (as Myra): It’s… weird in here.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, yeah, but what’s wrong with that?
Minna (as Myra): I mean, there’s nothing wrong with it, I’d just like to know how he does it.
Kim (as Blaire): What, live here?
Minna: I think Myra just shakes her head and gives up.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): So do we knock?
Josie: Minx will knock.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay.
Rhi: So, there’s a bit of a pause. You all are sort of starting to get a little nervous, and then the door creaks open and the person who opens the door is not Lord Scurlock. It’s a young man, mid-twneties, maybe a couple years older than Minx and Myra. Dark hair that’s just, kind of like, not really styled. It’s just sort of hanging down a little bit in his face. Also, you know, wearing a dark suit. Light skin. A little bit gaunt. Kind of sunken eyes. And sort of peers out at you and then opens the door and is like:
Rhi (as Young Man): Oh, you must be the guests that Uncle is expecting. Come in.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Thank you.
Rhi (as Young Man): I’m Oskar. I oversee the estate here. He’s expecting you.
Kim (as Blaire): Nice to meet you. Thank you.
Rhi: He leads you down a hall towards a room in the back of the mansion, which is just sort of a drawing room that looks like it probably hasn’t been opened up in several decades. Everything has a fine layer of dust on it. There’s, like, a decorative mirror on one wall that’s kind of tarnished. Like, this was clearly at one point a really nice sitting room. And there’s a still a lot of, like, there’s some nice paintings on the wall, there’s, you know, a curio cabinet with some nice sculptures and nice glasses and things. But everything just has this air of disuse and neglect to it.
Josie: Minx shies away from, like, touching anything. It’s so dusty.
Rhi: Yeah. The only things that are not dusty, that look like they were kind of recently cleaned is a couch and then two armchairs. One of the armchairs has been dusted off, the other one has not. And in the cleaned armchair is seated Lord Scurlock. Lord Scurlock is average height, wearing a navy blue suit that Minx, you immediately clock as being probably about forty of fifty years out of style. Like, it’s pretty old-fashioned.
Josie: Oh, wow.
Rhi: His hairstyle is also a little old-fashioned. He’s got dark hair that’s sort of a little longer and swept back, with gray streaks at the temples. He’s got kind of a grayish-blue cast to his skin, which is otherwise pale. He’s just sort of sitting there, and glances in your direction when the three of you enter. And Oskar kind of gives him a nod and then ducks back out and closes the door behind you.
Kim (as Blaire): So good to see you again, Lord Scurlock. Thank you for having us.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Indeed, Miss Culhane. Your missive was most intriguing. Who are your friends?
Kim (as Blaire): This is my crew. This is Minx and Myra.
Josie (as Minx): A pleasure.
Minna (as Myra): Hello.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Do you have family names?
Minna (as Myra): Keel. Myra Keel.
Josie (as Minx): Not at the moment.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Hmm.
Minna (as Myra): Our friend goes by a nom de guerre.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Well then. Pleasure to meet you Miss Keel, Miss Minx.
Rhi: And he, like, gestures at the couch.
Minna: When was the last time either of them got called ‘Miss’ anything?
Josie: [laughs] I dunno.
Rhi: Probably been a while.
Kim: He’s fancy.
Rhi: He’s old-fashioned.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Minx will, kind of, gingerly sit down on the couch.
Kim: Yeah, no, Blaire doesn’t hesitate to seat herself.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): So, you need some sort of artefact to settle some petty squabble amongst the criminal classes?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, yes. Yeah, that’s a good way to put it.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): What manner of artefact?
Kim (as Blaire): What do you think would get The Circle of Flame’s attention?
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Who are they?
Kim (as Blaire): The Circle of Flame? They’re an occult group. They worship a god.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Oh, yes. They’re mostly just, sort of, an irritant. I haven’t been overly concerned with them.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, they are unfortunately concerned with us. So if we could get them to drive their attention to The Lampblacks, that would be a huge help to us and to our allies.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, we had something we wanted to mimic, didn’t we?
Kim (as Blaire): A relic of Kotar.
Rhi: At that, his eyes widen slightly. He’s been pretty, like, flat affect, pretty unemotional this whole time, but when you mentioned that his eyes get a little wide and he actually looks interested for the first time in this whole conversation.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Indeed. Which of the three?
Kim (as Blaire): The Hand.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Hmm. How did you come into knowledge of these things?
Kim (as Blaire): All I know is that The Circle of Flame is interested in them.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Hmm. Perhaps I should have paid them a little more attention then.
Rhi: And he kind of, like, pauses for a few moments as he’s clearly thinking.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): I believe I have something in my collection that I could part with. It looks interesting, but has very little actual power. However, I am not willing to part with it for free.
Kim (as Blaire): I wouldn’t expect you to, no.
Rhi: He kind of thinks again for a moment then says:
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Wait here.
Rhi: And just stands up and walks out.
Josie (as Minx): Alright.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think he knows what The Hand looks like?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, if anyone does, it is likely him.
Kim (as Blaire): I want to ask.
Josie (as Minx): He called The Circle a minor irritation.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, he’s not really involved with the, you know, criminal underground.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Though I’m surprised they haven’t tried to lay more pressure on him.
Minna (as Myra): I think that they would not get very far trying to do that to a man with his reputation.
Kim (as Blaire): They wouldn’t even know where to find him. From what I understand, he’s rarely at this estate.
Josie (as Minx): Mm.
Rhi: So a few minutes pass before Scurlock returns. Do the three of you just, sort of, sit there quietly waiting?
Kim: Yeah and, like, whispering conspiratorially.
Minna: Yeah. Nervous chatter in whispers.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Minx is sort of drumming her fingers on the head of her cane.
Rhi: So after a few minutes, the door swings open again and Scurlock comes in and just hands Blaire a folded piece of paper.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): If you can obtain these items for me, we can make a trade.
Kim (as Blaire): Five pounds of raw sea salt, won’t be a problem. One barrel of refined electroplasm, lightning grade. One heart of a person who died by drowning?
Kim: As Blaire reads that last one, she’s gonna look up, like questioningly, at Lord Scurlock.
Rhi: He has returned to his seat and just stares at you without blinking.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And offers no explanation.
Kim (as Blaire): Well I have no doubts about us being able to acquire the first two, but we personally don’t know anyone who died by drowning. I’m sure I can find someone who could help us with that. But, it doesn’t matter the victim in particular, I assume?
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Adult is preferable.
Kim (as Blaire): Got it. Okay. We can do that, then.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Return here with the items and I will give you the trinket that you can use for whatever it is that you’re doing.
Kim (as Blaire): Of course. Do you have a timetable in mind?
Rhi: He shakes his head.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Not particularly.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): I would prefer not to wait more than a year or two.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs nervously] Well, we can definitely do this in less than a year. I think we can accomplish this in a week or two, don’t you think, guys?
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Josie: Minx has gone kind of sheet white.
[laughter]
Rhi: Does she have, like, a death grip on her cane?
Josie: Yep. She’s just kind of trusting her etiquette to maintain her posture and not freak out.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure we’ll do our best.
Kim (as Blaire): If I may, Lord Scurlock. Do you think this trinket will convincingly pass as The Hand of Kotar, assuming that The Circle of Flame doesn’t know what it looks like?
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): If they don’t know what it looks like, then yes, it should.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Then it seems we are in agreement. We’ll get these to you soon.
Rhi: He just nods and the door opens and Oskar is standing there again.
Kim (as Blaire): A pleasure, Sir.
Kim: Blaire is going to give a short curtsey before she leaves.
Rhi: [giggles] Aww. He gives her a nod, but doesn’t say anything.
Josie: Minx will give a short bow and then rather stiffly and robotically leave.
Kim: Good God, it’s not that bad. Minna?
Minna: Yes. Sorry, I was giggling at Josie and apparently forgot that I’m leaving too.
[laughter]
Minna: I think Myra will also curtsey to Scurlock and tell him that it was nice to meet him, and be very polite, and act like all of this is normal.
Rhi: Yep. So Oskar walks you back to the front door, holds it open and is like:
Rhi (as Oskar): Best of luck. You can just return here whenever you complete your tasks and I’ll notify him that you’ve finished with everything.
Kim and Minna (as Blaire and Myra): Thank you.
Rhi: He nods and shuts the door.
Kim (as Blaire): Phew, okay.
Josie (as Minx): [exhales in relief]
Kim (as Blaire): So that went well, right?
Minna (as Myra): Can I see that list again?
Kim (as Blaire): Five pounds of sea salt, which shouldn’t be a problem, one barrel of refined electroplasm, we might have to go somewhere to steal that. As far as a person who died by drowning, not entirely sure, but I’m pretty sure I could get Setarra to help on that.
Rhi: [coughs and splutters]
Kim: Rhi, are you okay?
Rhi: I’m good. I’m fine. I’m great.
Kim: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): I believe part of The Gondoliers tasks is fishing those kinds of people out of the canals.
Josie (as Minx): I would indeed prefer asking them, as opposed to leaping straight to Blaire’s aquatic friend.
Rhi: Yeah, so what I can tell you about these. There isn’t really an easy spot to get the heart of a person who died by drowning. You’re correct in that. Five pounds of raw sea salt you can get at basically any marketplace in the city. You could get that up on the docks, you could get that in Nightmarket, like, that’s a very easy get. The refined electroplasm is gonna be a little trickier.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Lightning grade means-, so basically, I’ve been thinking of electroplasm as a little bit like gasoline, where you can kind of have it refined to different levels of quality.
Kim: Exactly, that makes sense.
Rhi: And lightning grade means that it is refined to an extremely high density of life essence, and it is meant for use in the lightning barriers. So, this is something that pretty much you’re either going to be able to find being offloaded from leviathan hunter ships that have come back from Skovlan with the refined electroplasm, or with The Sparkwrights who maintain the lightning barrier. And, for what it’s worth, by a barrel of refined electroplasm, I do mean a 55-gallon drum.
Kim: Yeah. No, a big barrel.
Rhi: That based on my googling, weighs about 450-500 pounds.
Josie: Oh.
Rhi: So it’s gonna be not just stealing it, you’re gonna have to figure out how to move it. So, yeah. What do you wanna start doing for your info gathering?
Kim: I think we should probably just get the easiest one out of the way, start at the marketplace and get the sea salt.
Rhi: Okay. You have a five pound bag of sea salt.
Josie: Neat.
[laughter]
Kim: We got it.
Rhi: That’s just like, basically any place that sells food.
Minna: Didn’t we decide that’s, like, one of the most basic seasonings?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: And it’s, the sea salt, like just basic sea salt, is black.
Kim: Because–
Rhi: –the void sea–
Kim: –is black.
Josie: Okay. I think I want to… hmm. Well, okay, first we should decide on like, where we want to get the electroplasm from. Because we didn’t decide that, really.
Kim: Yeah, we need to discuss that. Should we head back to The Nest to talk about that?
Josie: Yes.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Alright. [sings] Doot de doot de doo, back to The Nest.
Josie: I would be in favour of hitting The Sparkwrights, simply because we know where that will be. It would be a simple in and out job.
Kim: Right. The only problem is transporting the actual barrel.
Josie: Well, can we call on our friends in the Cabbies?
Kim: Right. My question is though, would they be able to come into the vicinity of a Sparkwright maintenance tower, or warehouse, what-have-you, with little suspicion, or no?
Rhi: No, no. The Cabbies, like, you would have to find some way to move the barrel from the station out to wherever your ride is, Gondolier or Cabbie.
Josie: Uh, well the answer to that is simple. We roll it. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, you could roll it. They would also have, you know, push cart type things.
Josie: Right, but if we roll it, that opens the way for slapstick action scenes on the way out.
Rhi: This is true. This is very true. Josie makes an excellent point.
Kim: She does.
Rhi: I mean, and you don’t have to decide right now. You know, whatever the situation is when you’re trying to escape with the barrel.
Josie: Right, but either way, it sounds like we’re maybe going for The Sparkwrights?
Kim: I think a Sparkwrights maintenance station is probably going to be the safest, lowest risk option.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm. As much as I want to, like, pull on my social interactions here, I think just finding a suitable station would be best. One that’s easily accessible by Gondoliers, and one that we can get into.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: So, like, I kinda wanna do a Gather Information Survey, I imagine?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. Do you wanna do that as a group, or do you all wanna split up and kinda check different areas of the city? How do you wanna approach this?
Josie: Split up, gang. We’ll cover more ground that way.
Kim: Zoinks Scoob, okay.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: Let’s start with Minx, since this was her idea.
Josie: I got a 4.
Rhi: Over in Silkshore, there’s a pair of the big lightning barriers. Because there’s the big, big, like, 200-foot towers that kind of are like the main lightning generators, and then there’s little smaller ones that kind of carry the charge to form the wall.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So in Silkshore, there’s two of the big towers and near one of them is something called the Spark Grounds. Which, from the book, here’s the description. This is wild. ‘Beneath the crackling flares of a lightning tower, this open field draws crowds to watch the death-defying stunts of acrobats and circus performers, including the notorious Spark Flyers, who soar in manned kites adorned with bits of metal to attract arcs of electricity from the barrier in a pyrotechnic display’.
Kim: Are you fucking kidding me?
Josie: What the fuck?
Rhi: Nope, there are people who do circus tricks in the lightning barrier.
Kim: Jesus. I didn’t know that.
Josie: [sings circus music]
Rhi: Yeah. So, Minx, you know this place. It’s in Silkshore, maybe you and Nyryx have gone there before to sort of watch some of the performances.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: But it’s a thing where it’s like, it seems like initially not the best idea because there’s a crowd. But then, thinking about it, maybe you can use the crowd as cover. Usually there’s not a lot of people around the lightning barrier towers, they tend to be a little more removed from the rest of the city. This is one of the few areas where you can get fairly close to one without attracting a lot of attention. So, that is the one that you are able to find. Whoever wants to go next?
Kim: I’ll go next.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I am going to go, I guess Survey, for the Gather Info. Okay, 5.
Rhi: You have passed by way down south in like, Dunslough, south of Barrelcleft, kind of where the farms are. When you go into the Deathlands, that’s kind of where your entrance point is. You go down to the very south of the city.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: And so you know where there is a Sparkwright maintenance station, kind of near your entry and exit point. And you kind of have the advantage of because you have come through this area before, you are a little more familiar with the guard patterns and patrols. You don’t cross super close to the station, because that is where the guards are, but you’ve familiarised yourself with kind of how they operate, so you can avoid them. So, that’s what you know. You know that there’s one you could possibly hit down in Dunslough. The problem, kind of with both of these options, Silkshore and Dunslough, is that they’re both pretty far away from Six Towers. Silkshore’s clean on the other side of the city, and Dunslough isn’t much better.
Josie: That’s true.
Rhi: So, you know, you would have to deal with hauling it all the way across the city.
Kim: All the way to Six Towers.
Rhi: Yeah. Myra, did you wanna also look for a robbery point, or did you want to do some other kind of Gather Info?
Minna: Do we have, like, a preferred one of those two robbery points?
Josie: I wanna go to the circus.
Minna: I mean, speaking out of character, I wanna go to the circus. I forgot that exists and I love it so much.
Kim: Yeah, I think you’re right.
Minna: So, yeah, I think let’s go with that one and I’ll try to do a Gather Info to, I guess, help us find out, like, how to get in to get the barrels.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so basically just kind of like looking around the maintenance station to see how deliveries work, where things are stored, just what you can see from the outside?
Minna: Yeah, sure. I’ll do a Survey.
Rhi: Or you could try to disguise yourself and sneak in.
Minna: Hmm. Lemme look at which one would be…
Rhi: You do have your fine cover identity back.
Minna: Oh, that’s right.
Rhi: So you could. And Myra, I think, could very easily pose as some kind of Sparkwright inspector, or something.
Minna: Could I maybe, like, do a Gather Info to find out more about what Sparkwright inspectors do?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Minna: Really? I rolled a 3.
Josie and Kim: Aww.
Rhi: You, okay, I mean, that still gets you a limited amount of information. You know that these kind of inspectors that go out to check on the workings of the lightning barriers exist.
Minna: Could I find out, like, what their uniforms look like?
Rhi: They don’t really, so, Sparkwrights are…
Minna: Are they like plain clothes?
Rhi: They’re kind of, yeah, they’re plain clothes but I think they basically have a lapel pin that they wear, that’s kind of their identifier. Yeah, The Sparkwrights are sort of a loosely organised group of engineers. And there is a hierarchy, but they’re not very formal. They’re not like, you know, The Bluecoats or the actual inspectors, where they have uniforms and ranks and stuff. It’s just kind of like–
Minna: They’re basically a guild. A professional guild.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. So, that’s pretty much all you’re able to find out though, is that, like, they have these-, what do we think the pins look like?
Kim: I think it’s probably like a stylised lightning rod, or a lightning hook.
Rhi: I like the idea of a lightning rod, so it’s like a ring and then a lightning rod in the middle with bolts shooting out towards the ring on the edge.
Kim: Yes, yes.
Rhi: Yeah. But that’s kind of all you’re able to find out, you don’t know what they do when they are inspecting.
Minna: Eh, I can bluff pretty well.
Rhi: Yes you can.
Josie: I kinda wanna know more about these circus performers. Like, I wanna know when a big event is happening.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay, that you don’t have to roll a Gather Info check for. There are just flyers around, advertising. Because like, they want people to know when they’re performing because that’s how they make their money. Like, people will leave them tips and stuff. You learn that kind of the next big performance is happening in two days.
Josie: Alright. Well, I mean, if we were to do this amidst the chaos and distraction of that show, that would be ideal.
Rhi: And in the meantime, you can get yourselves a heart.
Minna: Should we go as a group to the request?
Kim: Probably.
Minna: We probably talk to that leader person, right?
Rhi: Eisele.
Minna: What’s their name? Eisele. Okay.
Rhi: Okay. So the three of you troop down to the Gondolier headquarters. Kay is out at the moment. Eisele will let you into her office if you knock, and she’s just like:
Rhi (as Eisele): Oh, hey. That was quick. Kay told me she just talked to you all earlier today.
Josie (as Minx): Well, unfortunately we are still in progress, although it should be resolved within the week.
Rhi (as Eisele): Oh. Alright.
Josie (as Minx): But as a stepping stone for another trade, we um… well, you see…
Kim (as Blaire): We have a weird request.
Rhi (as Eisele): Uh-huh.
Josie (as Minx): I imagine that unfortunately, in your line of work, you sometimes come across unfortunate individuals who have taken on too much water?
Rhi (as Eisele): Yeah…
Josie (as Minx): Well, you see, we would need, um–
Kim (as Blaire): We need the body of a person who drowned.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, that one.
Josie: Minx is-, do you guys know the ‘white person smile’?
[laughter]
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: I don’t know this meme.
Kim: The thing that, like, white people do when they make eye contact. They just kind of purse their lips really thin.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Somebody give me some kind of roll.
Kim: I can, do we wanna do a group consort? Because this is an honest request.
Josie: Yeah, group consort.
Kim: Okay. I’ll lead it if you guys don’t mind, I’ve got no stress.
Minna: Okay. I rolled a 6.
Rhi: Nice.
Kim: I rolled a 5.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Nice, okay.
Kim: Oh, so no stress, yay.
Rhi: So, result is a 6 and nobody takes any stress, awesome.
Kim: Yay!
Rhi: Eisele stares at the three of you for a little bit, and is like:
Rhi (as Eisele): Eh, we’ve had weirder requests. Um, yeah, we can keep an eye out. It doesn’t happen as often as you’d think. Most of the corpses we fish out got shot or stabbed or pushed off of something and then fell into the canals. But, yeah, some folk do drown, so we can keep an eye out.
Kim (as Blaire): So long as it’s an adult and the heart’s intact, that’s all we need.
Rhi: [laughs] At ‘the heart’s intact’, she like raises an eyebrow and then is like:
Rhi (as Eisele): We’ll see what we can do for ya.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Josie (as Minx): Alright, well thank you.
Rhi: Is there anything else that you all wanna do before the circus?
Kim: Yes.
Josie: Um–
Kim: You first, Josie.
Josie: I want to have a circus person disguise ready.
Rhi: Okay, interesting. Okay.
Josie: Like, probably not an acrobat outfit, but a sort of charming outfit that someone working behind the scenes would wear.
Rhi: Oh okay, so not necessarily one of the performers, but kind of one of the stagehands.
Josie: Yes, you know, colourful pants, suspenders.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, I’m trying to think of how I wanna… give me a fortune roll for how much money you have.
Josie: Okay, how do I do that?
Rhi: However many rows of money you have filled in, roll that. So if you have, like, two rows of money filled in, roll two.
Josie. I got a 6 again.
Rhi: Okay, nice. So yeah, you are able to ask around in Silkshore and you get directed to the tailor who actually makes, like, a lot of the costumes for the performers.
Josie: Oh, wow.
Rhi: And, yeah, you are able to get actually one of the uniforms that the stagehands wear. And yes, it is very brightly coloured, lots of patterns, suspenders, definitely.
Josie: Excellent.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Minx will attempt to smile while wearing this.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: Blaire, what did you wanna do?
Kim: I want Blaire to study the guard patterns at this location, so that she is at least somewhat more familiar with it.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Okay, my highest was a 5.
Rhi: Okay. You know what the guards’ kind of normal patterns are, but because you’re there on an off day when there’s not a performance, you’re not sure if it changes.
Kim: Exactly, that’s what I’m worried about.
Rhi: You’ve at least kind of got, like, you know where the guard posts are.
Kim: Okay, awesome. That’s what I wanted to know.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, are you all ready to dive into this score?
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: So, man, what kinda score is this?
Josie: Um… deception?
Minna: Deception.
Rhi: That’s actually what I was thinking, yeah. I don’t know that you all have ever done a deception score before.
Kim: That’s weird.
Minna: Avrathi’s embassy.
Rhi: Oh, yeah, yeah. That was. Engagement roll. One for luck. Is this operation particularly bold or daring?
Josie: It’s pretty standard.
Rhi: Yeah. Is it overly complex or contingent on many factors? No. Does the plan’s detail expose a vulnerability of the target? Not especially. Any of your friends or contacts provide aid? Nope.
Kim: I’d say yes.
Rhi: Really? Who? I mean–
Kim: I mean the Cabbies count as friends of ours, right?
Rhi: But they didn’t give you info for the break-in part.
Kim: Oh, true.
Rhi: Yeah, they’re just your getaway drivers. Gonna just be a 1d6 roll. You’re going in on pure luck.
Kim: It’s fine. We’re good. This is fine.
Rhi: So, a 5. Which means you’re starting off in a risky position. We see sort of a high-up shot of the lightning barrier, the lightning crackling and shifting against the blackness of the sky and the sea. And then a glider swoops through with a person hanging from it, and lightning arcs onto the glider and sparks fly off of it, and a big cheer rises up from beneath. And the camera sort of pans down to reveal the spark field full of people. There are acrobats on the ground, there are people set up with like, food stalls, kind of out on the edges. It’s basically kind of like a circus has come to town atmosphere. And I wanna go around and each of you tell me, like, just something eye-catching that is happening as we’re sort of looking over this scene.
Minna: I think that there’s somebody with a fire, and they’re throwing stuff in it to make, like, cool colours and patterns happen in the flames.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi. Oh, cool, yeah! So like a big brazier of fire that they throw, like, a handful of powder into and the flames turn blue and different colours.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. That’s cool, I like that. Yeah, and so I think there’s like a small crowd of children gathered around who are like [gasps] ‘Ooh!’ any time that the fire changes colour.
Kim: There is a man walking on a tightrope. A small crowd is gathered to watch him. There is a hot bed of coals on the ground below him and he is juggling three lightning hooks as he walks the tightrope.
Rhi: [laughs] Oh, that’s awesome. So, it’s like if he falls off he’s gonna fall into the coals?
Kim: If he falls off, he gets a foot full of hot coals, yeah, and the lightning hooks are live lightning hooks that are sparking.
Rhi: Yeah, oh that’s cool. That’s very cool. Yeah, so there’s a good sized crowd gathered around this guy and he at one point, kind of in the middle, he does sort of like a fancy toss and wobbles on the tightrope, and people are like ‘Oh no!’ and a couple people kind of clutch at each other, then he catches all the lightning hooks and keeps walking.
Kim: Yep. There’s definitely a hat open for tips nearby.
Rhi: Yeah. Yes, all of the performers have some kind of place where you can throw coins.
Josie: I think there’s like a small acting troupe set up somewhere. Like, it’s a very obviously cartoony and fake stage, and people just kind of come and go from the audience whenever they want. And there’s a lot of bombastic folk tales and stuff being told, and a lot of acrobatics from the actors. And one time, like, something bad happens right in time with someone going by the lightning barrier, so lightning strikes as a sound effect.
Rhi: Oh, nice.
Kim: That’s awesome.
Josie: That sort of thing. I kind of, I dunno, for some reason I imagine Harker is here. Like, he’s not really into the score, but he’s involved somehow. Like, he’s maybe a slightly skeevy ringleader or play master, narrator, or something.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. He can be there, doing some sort of dramatic narration. He’s got a shabby top hat.
Josie: Exactly.
Minna: I think, as a person, he just is a shabby top hat.
Rhi: Yeah, that is sort of the embodiment of Harker.
Josie: Right.
[laiughter]
Rhi: Oh no, you know what? He got involved in it because he brings a bunch of his street urchins who go through the crowd and pickpocket people who are watching the show.
Josie: There we go.
Rhi: Yeah. Because he doesn’t make nearly enough money off of the tips when you have to divide it up between the whole crew, but from what all those kids bring in when he takes his cuts, then it’s worth his time.
Josie: There you go.
Rhi: Yeah. There’s our skeevy Harker. Alright, so that’s kind of the scene of this circus that’s happening out here in this big field. Where are the three of you all kind of entering? I assume from some of the disguises that some of you are entering separately.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yep, Blaire has her spirit mask on and her hood up, just to disguise her face for now, she will take it off soon. But just to disguise her features. That’s basically her on-person disguise that she always has.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna-, I’m gonna do a lot of my usual role of kind of like running interference here. Like, I’m gonna move about as a worker to assist performers and stuff, but I wanna ensure that some sort of performance gets set up right in front of the entryway where Myra intends to go in, so view is blocked, essentially.
Rhi: Okay. I like this idea, can I make a suggestion?
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Instead of the entryway where Myra is gonna go in, in front of the exit where you all are gonna be going out.
Josie: That is fair.
Rhi: I think you initially start setting it up a little too close and the guards kind of have to be like:
Rhi (as Guard): Hey, hey, hey, you gotta move it ten feet that direction, that’s as close as you can get.
Josie (as Minx): Alright, alright, dears, no need to be hostile.
Rhi: So yeah, so for right now you’re just kind of hanging out side keeping an eye on the situation?
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay, cool.
Minna: Myra is dressed a little outlandishly, for Myra at least. So she’s wearing something that almost looks more like a Phin outfit. She’s got kinda like a double breasted waistcoat partly open, all her clothes are dirty brown, clearly work clothes. She has, like, a pair of goggles shoved up on her head.
Rhi: Nice. Just embracing the steampunk aesthetic.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: I love it.
Minna: Which I feel like The Sparkwrights definitely do.
Rhi: Uh-huh, yeah. So Myra makes her way up towards The Sparkwright station. There’s a pair of guards, one on either side of the door. And when you get close, one of them steps forward and holds up her hand, and is like:
Rhi (as guard): Uh, excuse me. Can we help you?
Minna (as Myra): Hi, I’m the inspector. I was wondering if I could be shown to your setup.
Minna: And she kind of turns up, like, the lapels of her waistcoat are kinda curled over and she turns one up and you see a pin just like the ones that The Sparkwrights use.
Rhi: Yes, and let’s get a flashback for how that was acquired.
Minna: [laughs] I think you see Myra at a bar, and she’s like continuously buying drinks for somebody who seems quite friendly. I think it’s a woman with her hair piled up on her head and she’s laughing, and Myra’s like, asking her questions and seeming fascinated. And they kind of leave the bar together, Myra’s acting a little bit intoxicated too, and like, she has this woman’s arm slung over her shoulder, and you kind of see her hand reach up and unpin the pin and slip it in her pocket.
Rhi: Okay. Two things. It’ll cost you a point of stress and I’ll need you to make a roll of some kind for that lift, to take the pin.
Minna: Okay, that sounds like a Finesse.
Rhi: Probably. The other thing, as soon as you said a woman with her hair piled up, I did picture Doc Ock from Into The Spiderverse, so that’s who you pickpocketed.
[laughter and cheers]
Kim: Yes!
Josie: Excellent.
Rhi: Sorry, that’s just canon now.
Minna: No, I’m into it.
Josie: That’s so good though.
Kim: It’s good.
Minna: Can I push myself on this roll?
Rhi: Yeah, if you wanna burn a little more stress on it, yeah.
Minna: Fuck me. I rolled a 2.
Rhi: Ooh, okay. So, she notices you going for it, and seems to-, she doesn’t sober up, but she reacts a lot more quickly than you’d expect for somebody that drunk, and just kind of whips you around and slams you into a wall and is like:
Rhi (as Sparkwright Woman): What the hell are you doing?
Rhi: So you’re gonna have to do another roll to deal with this situation now, probably a Skirmish.
Minna: Yeah. I think this woman finds that there is now a knife pricking at her stomach and Myra smiles at her.
Minna (as Myra): I just need to borrow it for a bit. You don’t mind do you?
Rhi: Gimme a roll and we’ll find out.
Minna: Can that be, actually, a Command instead?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Really? The dice hate me!
Kim: Oh no, what was it?
Minna: I rolled a 1!
Kim: No!
Josie: Oh, Minna.
Minna: That’s so bad.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, you can either keep attempting this in this flashback, or you’re gonna have to just not have the pin.
Minna: I kind of wanna keep attempting it, because it’s very good.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: What was the position and effect on that last roll?
Rhi: Risky, standard.
Minna: Because it could become desperate as a result?
Rhi: Yeah, I think that’s what it is, is that she, like, grabs your wrist and twists it out of the way, and is pressing her fingers into some, you know, nerves in your wrist to make you drop the knife.
Minna: I just wanna think of a way out of this being Skirmish. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Because I’m not very good at it.
Rhi: I’m gonna do something a little-, partly I’m gonna do this because I also want you to get this pin, because I think it’s more fun that way, but also because this will work for my plans. I’m gonna do something that is not precisely in the rules, but I don’t care, I like it. I’m gonna offer you a Devil’s Bargain.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: You can have the pin, you can get it from her during this scuffle and she will be too drunk to really remember your face. However, somebody who you would rather didn’t witness this does, and is going to use that information to interfere in the score.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: So, I got the pin?
Rhi: Yeah, so I think–
Minna: I think it becomes like a struggle, and then she eventually like–
Rhi: Yeah, it’s a little bit of a scuffle. I think that what eventually happens is you manage to, like, spin her around and bang her head into the wall and that knocks her out, and then you can take the pin and run, and between the alcohol and the head trauma she doesn’t really remember much of what happened. So, yeah, then we come back. And I think that as we come back we can see Myra has some bandages wrapped around her knuckles. Yeah, so you show this pin and I think now I’ll need you to make another-, this will be risky, to get past the guards, to bluff your way through. The guards are kind of like:
Rhi (as Guard): We usually don’t have inspections on festival days, but… uh…
Rhi: They’re a little sceptical right now.
Minna: What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Um…
Josie: Now is when the person interferes?
Rhi: Yeah, I like Josie’s idea. That the person is going to interfere now.
Minna: Ooh, that’s fun.
Rhi: So, yeah. Go ahead and make your roll.
Minna: 5.
Rhi: Okay. So, the guards are kinda eyeing you a little suspiciously, they’re like:
Rhi (as Guard): We usually don’t have inspectors in on performance days.
Rhi: And then, Myra, someone comes up beside and slings their arm around your shoulders. And a voice that you kinda had hoped to never hear again says:
Rhi (as voice): So sorry, my partner got here before me.
Rhi: And you turn to look and you see a very familiar young man–
Minna: Oh, it’s Wester [giggles]
Rhi: ­–dressed impeccably in a Sparkwright getup with a pin of his own, standing there, smiling brightly at the guards.

Rhi: Yeah, all of your red string conspiracy thing all leads up to a picture of my cat.

For those of you attending Gen Con this August, Minna and I will be there with Magpies bookmarks. I’m also going to be moderating a panel discussion about starting an Actual Play podcast. Keep an eye out for that panel if you’re going to be attending. We’re hoping to record the audio from it, but we don’t have those plans set in stone yet. Next, let me tell you about this month’s featured charity.
The National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center is a non-profit dedicated to supporting indigenous women in the United States who are facing domestic violence, as well as helping Native American tribes and tribal organisations better respond to domestic violence. Their goals are to show that offenders will be held accountable, and that native women and children are entitled to; safety from violence within their homes and in their community, justice both on and off tribal lands, and access to services designed by and for native women based on their tribal beliefs and practices. Visit www.niwrc.org/donate to support their work. And there will be a link to their site in the show notes.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## Story continues [00.01.49]
Rhi: And then Myra, someone comes up beside you and slings their arm around your shoulders. And a voice that you kinda had hoped to never hear again says:
Rhi (as Voice): So sorry, my partner got here before me.
Rhi: And you turn to look and you see a very familiar young man–
Minna: Oh, it’s Wester [giggles]
Rhi: ­–dressed impeccably in a Sparkwright getup with a pin of his own, standing there, smiling brightly at the guards. This is Wester.
Minna: Yes! [laughs]
Rhi: This is the other of Salia’s apprentices–
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: –and he’s got his arm around your shoulders and is grinning at the guards, is like:
Rhi (as Wester): I know we normally don’t do this on the performance days, but the schedule got shifted around and we have to get this in now. My partner here’s new to the ranks of the inspectors, so she’s not clear on all the procedure.
Rhi: And the guards are just, kind of, like:
Rhi (as Guard): [sigh] Alright, alright, yeah.
Rhi: And they open the door and he looks at you and the grin doesn’t change, but the look in his eyes is just this absolute smugness.
Minna: Ew.
Josie: Ugh.
Rhi: And he gestures for you to go in before him.
Kim: Ugh.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Minna: Very fake smile. [laughs]
Rhi: So, the two of you head inside. And we’re gonna cut over to Blaire.
Kim: Yeah, Blaire is just looking for Minx. She’s going to take her mask off, but leave her hood up, and go:
Kim (as Blaire): Hey. Hey!
Josie (as Minx): Er, yes dear?
Kim (as Blaire): Where’s Myra?
Josie (as Minx): She’s heading inside, on the other side.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. I thought we were all heading inside.
Josie (as Minx): Well I thought you were heading inside as well, but me, I’m rather occupied with this puppet show at the moment.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Well, keep doing what you’re doing. I’m gonna try and look for Myra.
Josie (as Minx): Alright, as you wish.
Rhi: Alright. So are you gonna try and sneak inside, Blaire?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Where do you wanna try and sneak in?
Kim: Um, they didn’t leave the door open, did they?
Rhi: No. I’m picturing this as a two-storey building with a balcony, like, metal balcony cat-walk type thing going all the way around the second floor, so that guards can kind of walk around up on the top.
Kim: Let me go to a side where there’s a window and just press my face up against there and look inside.
Rhi: [amused] Okay, um, yeah, roll something to sneak up there.
Kim: Well, let me Prowl a bit to get there first, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: And I will push myself as well, so that way I get two dice for this. Okay, 5.
Rhi: You sneak on over to a window and press your face up against it, and you’re looking into, kind of, it’s an office with the door open on the other side. So, like, there’s a desk and some papers. No one is in there. And as you’re peering inside, you see walking past in the hallway, first you see Myra, followed immediately by a man you’ve never seen before.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: As you’re looking, you here a:
Rhi (as Voice): Hey! What are you doing down there?
Rhi: And you look up and there is a guard standing on the balcony above you, looking down at you. Hasn’t, like, drawn weapons or anything, is just looking down, being like:
Rhi: (as Guard): You can’t-, the performances are over that way. You can’t be over here.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, sorry! I was looking for the guide? The tour house? The cabinet of curiosities. Do they have that tent here?
Rhi: (as Guard): [exasperated] Yeah, it’s over that way. By the food stalls.
Kim (as Blaire): I must have missed it, thank you!
Rhi: Okay, so Blaire darts off, having been foiled. Good bluff, though, good bluff.
Kim: Thank you.
Josie: [giggles]
Kim: I am pulling very deep from my Ren Faire knowledge.
Rhi: Blaire goes hustling away, kind of back towards the performance area that Minx is working at. And I think we stay on that window and move into the building to follow Myra and Wester. Wester sort of glances around and steers you into an empty office. Not the same one that Blaire was looking into, but one kind of across the hall, without windows.
Minna (as Myra): So good to see you, Wester. Since when are you Salia’s first choice for infiltrations?
Rhi (as Wester): Oh, Myra. Things have changed quite a bit since you decided to cut and run.
Rhi: And he crosses his arms and is standing in the doorway, so you’re blocked in.
Minna: Myra says:
Minna (as Myra): Well, just remember that in here, my name is Althea, and don’t get in my way.
Rhi (as Wester): Oh, [laughs smugly] why do you think I’m here? I don’t know what exactly you’re trying to do, but after your little stunt with that Sparkwright in the alley the other night? Oh no, no, no, I am exactly here to get in your way. You should have a seat. You’re not really going anywhere.
Minna (as Myra): And why do you care what I do anymore?
Rhi (as Wester): Oh, we have our reasons. Reasons that you might know about if you had stuck around.
Minna (as Myra): Would you care to enlighten me? You were never very good at that, though.
Rhi (as Wester): No, I think I would rather just wait here for, well, I dunno who it’ll be. Will it be The Bluecoats? Will it be those Umbra Hunters? Which one would you prefer?
Minna (as Myra): Well, if I’ve got a choice in the matter…
Rhi (as Wester): Oh, you don’t. I would just like to know which is the worse option for you. I mean, they’re both pretty terrible.
Minna (as Myra): You know me, Wester. I never tell you anything important.
Rhi: And he just kinda leans against the door frame.
Rhi (as Wester): You really ruined things for yourself, didn’t you?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think so. Honestly, I can’t believe you’re all staying under her heel.
Rhi (as Wester): I’m not under anything. We’ve moved up in the world.
Minna (as Myra): Moved up in the world? Yes, as Salia’s pets, I’m sure.
Rhi: He kind of sneers at you, and moves in from the doorway a little bit, and is like:
Rhi (as Wester): She trusts me more than she ever trusted you. And she was right for it, since you don’t have an ounce of loyalty in you.
Minna (as Myra): I have plenty of loyalty to those who deserve it.
Rhi (as Wester): She is gonna love seeing you again.
Minna (as Myra): It’s so sad. You really think that you’re gonna become something in her ranks, when she has no intention of ever letting you get up there.
Rhi (as Wester): You don’t know anything about her. And you sure as hell don’t know anything about me, and what I have planned.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure that will go wonderfully. Are we done here?
Rhi (as Wester): No. No, I meant it when I said that we were staying here until people come to take you away. Salia’s got big plans, and you are a part of them. A small cog in the machine, but part of that involves delivering you to the right people. And your friends. We’ll deal with them pretty soon, I’m sure.
Minna: I’m trying to think what Myra does here. See, I think the thing that makes the most sense here is to get mad and confront him physically, but that probably won’t go well because he’s probably always been better than her at that kind of thing.
Rhi: Yes, however he is also an arrogant white guy.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: He’s not gonna expect you to attack him.
Minna: Yeah, no, I think that’s exactly, like, she’s still grinning, and like–
Rhi: Yeah, if you were to just whip out a pistol and shoot at him–
Josie: Kick him in the nuts!
Rhi: Or do that, you would have-, I would honestly say for the initial attack you would be controlled, because he is not expecting you to do anything to him. He thinks he’s won.
Minna: I think that’s the plan, because–
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: And she probably knows this about him, that he is an arrogant son of a bitch. And she spent so many years learning their weaknesses, and learning how to play around them.
Rhi: Yep. What are you rolling?
Minna: I’m rolling some Skirmish.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: And I have rolled a 6. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah!
Josie: Nice.
Kim: Woo! Yes, girl!
Rhi: So, tell me exactly how you–
Minna: So I think Myra’s still grinning in that pleasant, catty way, and then in a split second she is, like, lunging towards him. And I think she reaches him with, like, her knee up and into the soft bits.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. I think he had, just barely, when you moved he had just started to get his arms unfolded and had enough time to look surprised, and then your knee connects and he’s on the ground.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: With a 6, you just nailed him. And he’s just down, curled up.
Minna: Can I…
Rhi: Yeah?
Minna: Dose him with slumber essence?
Rhi: Yes, you can.
Josie: Oof.
Kim: This is so good.
Rhi: I will just let you, like, yeah, if you just wanna slap a rag to his face while he’s down.
Minna (as Myra): You are going to learn very soon what it means when you come up against me.
Rhi: Yeah, he doesn’t really respond. You just kind of like put that on his face, and he’s breathing hard because you’ve just caused him a lot of pain so he inhales a whole bunch of it, and then is dozing peacefully on the floor.
Minna: [giggles] Such a fucking power fantasy.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, God that was good.
Kim: Yes Myra!
Rhi: Alright. Now what are you gonna do?
Minna: Proceed along to do the thing that I came to do.
Rhi: Alright. So you head deeper into the station. Let’s cut back out to Minx. Tell me about this puppet show.
Josie: I’m like, the assistant to the puppet show. So I’m thinking it’s kind of like those paper shadow puppets.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Ooh.
Josie: So it’s all these weird elongated shapes acting out, like, weird parables and myths and the like.
Rhi: Okay, cool. So yeah, you’re back there doing that and Blaire darts up to you.
Kim (as Blaire): I couldn’t get inside.
Josie (as Minx): Alright. Well, give me a moment, get by a window.
Kim (as Blaire): There’s a balcony. The guards will see me from above. I need a distraction.
Josie (as Minx): I know, I’m about to do a distraction.
Josie: I wanna do two things. One is I wanna, like, look up to one of the kite flyers, if they’re going.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: And I kinda wanna make an X with my forearms and then make the signal for, like, go again. And kind of have an apologetic look on my face. And then I want to try to indicate to the person running the puppet show that another flash is coming, play into it.
Rhi: Okay, you’re gonna need to roll something to, sort of, do all of those non-verbal communications.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: I think you’re in a controlled position with this, because there’s not really an immediate threat.
Josie: Uh-huh. Sway?
Rhi: Yeah, you could do Sway.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think we’re gonna go with you do it with a minor consequence. What are you trying to achieve?
Josie: I’m trying to get another lightning flash pyrotechnic show going on and a bunch of people to be looking up at it, so that Blaire can sneak in through a window or something.
Rhi: Okay, so you’re trying to draw the attention of the guards as well.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So you do it, but there’s a minor consequence.
Kim: I have an idea for a consequence, but it’s probably not minor.
Rhi: Let me hear it, we might be able to adapt it.
Kim: Yeah. What if one of the kite flyers gets, like, a little too close or caught in a blast, and the wing gets damaged or singed in a way?
Rhi: That could work, to where, like, Blaire has a much shorter window to get in.
Josie: Or yeah, maybe they, like, they’re losing altitude so they have to pull off and it’s not as spectacular as I was hoping?
Rhi: You’re basically at reduced effect for that. The thing goes and, like, there is a lot of popping and electric stuff, and the guard is looking up, but is not quite as distracted. So this is basically a set-up action. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver gets +1 effect or improved position. Okay. So, Blaire you can either be at greater effect or controlled position for your next sneaking in attempt.
Kim: I would like greater effect.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I’m trying to decide what to roll to open up this window while they’re distracted. I feel like it would either be Tinker or Prowl?
Rhi: Either one. You could do either.
Kim: I’m gonna do a Prowl and also push myself with 2 stress.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 6.
Rhi: Nice. Yeah, so you zip over there while the lightning is crackling above and you pop that open and slide inside.
Kim: Do I see Myra, or no?
Rhi: I’m gonna say, since you had greater effect, I think you climbed into like, the office across the hall from where Myra and Wester were. So you see that same guy that you saw briefly with Myra curled up on the floor, seemingly unconscious.
Minna: [giggles] Follow the breadcrumbs.
Rhi: You don’t see Myra anywhere, but like, you know more or less where Myra was gonna head, so you also head towards the loading dock.
Kim (as Blaire): Great work, Myra.
Rhi: Yeah, so you hustle off that way. And I think that you catch up with Myra in the hallway outside the loading dock area. The station doesn’t really require, like, constant monitoring, but there are a couple people in the loading bay area.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: They’re not guards, they look like they’re employees who just work here.
Kim: Yeah, still, it’s witnesses either way.
Rhi: Myra, what are you doing, peering in this doorway, how are you standing when Blaire sneaks up next to you?
Minna: I mean, I don’t think I’m, like, looking sneaky, I think I’m looking like a person who at any moment could walk in that door casually.
Rhi: Oh, yeah, yeah. So you’re, like, standing out there readying yourself, and then Blaire kinda comes up behind you.
Kim: I’m probably just gonna, like, tug at her vest, and be like:
Kim (as Blaire): Hey!
Minna (as Myra): Oh, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I figured you would need help getting this thing out.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, yeah, I could use help with that. Looks like there’s a couple people here. They think I’m an inspector, but they also think that I’m here with a partner. Not you, unfortunately.
Rhi: Well, here’s the thing.
Minna: Only the door person thinks I’m here with a partner.
Rhi: The guards were told that you were here with a partner.
Minna (as Myra): Well, I’m an inspector. You can be my assistant, maybe?
Kim (as Blaire): They thought your partner was the guy that you knocked out?
Minna (as Myra): Oh, you saw him, did you?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I saw him on my way in.
Minna (as Myra): Uh, yeah, little bit of difficulty there, but we’re fine now, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Well, so long as the guards, you know, don’t get confused seeing a different partner than the one that you came in with, right?
Minna (as Myra): I think we’d better not take the front door out.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, yeah, then that’s good.
Minna (as Myra): How are we gonna get one of these out of here?
Kim (as Blaire): We just need one. Um…
Kim: Should I roll, like, a Survey to try and find some kind of flatbed truck that could wagon this thing out?
Rhi: Yeah, it’s gonna be risky, because if you’re doing this while you’re still trying to be not spotted, you know, if they see you peering in the door they’re gonna come to investigate.
Kim: Just look? I mean, that’s fine.
Rhi: Go ahead and make your roll.
Kim: Oh wow, that’s a 6.
Rhi: So, opposite from the door where you’re looking there’s a set of big double doors that look like they would be pushed open from the inside by a couple people. And then there’s just like, kind of, boxes and crates and shelves of various equipment, and then there is a storage cage with a locked door that has several barrels of electroplasm.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And then there’s a couple people there, and near the big doors there’s a couple, like, dollies, or flatbed carts, or things with wheels that you can put stuff on to use physics to make it easier to move heavy objects. [laughs]
Kim: Okay. Okay, at that point, then, I’m just gonna look back at Myra and be like:
Kim (as Blaire): There’s a flatbed truck, and I saw where the refined electroplasm was. I think we got this.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): We just need to head in there.
Minna (as Myra): I think I can probably brazen it out.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Well, I’ll let you do the talking. You just need to head in there. Follow your lead.
Minna: And Myra walks confidently into this room.
Kim: I follow.
Rhi: Alright. So, the two people working in here, they seem to be sorting through equipment and grumbling to each other.
Minna (as Myra): Is one of you in charge?
Rhi (as Worker): [startled] Ah! Oh!
Rhi: And like, the person who is talking, their eyes go to the pin on your vest, and is like:
Rhi (as Worker): Uh, oh, I didn’t know we were having an inspection today. Um, sorry, I guess I am? I’m Alma.
Minna (as Myra): Althea Morris, lovely to meet you.
Rhi (as Alma): Er, yeah, hi. Sorry, yeah, the station head I think is out watching the show. Um, what can we help you with?
Minna (as Myra): I’ve taken a bit of a walk around, the set-up seems fine. I need to take away one of these barrels. We got some testing we have to do, we’re kinda gathering from…
Rhi (as Alma): Oh.
Minna (as Myra): It hasn’t all gone out yet, we’re gonna try it with this barrel first.
Rhi: Gimme a roll.
Minna: Alright, that sounds like a Sway.
Kim: Do you want an assist?
Minna: Yes please.
Kim: Okay. Is that 1 stress, Rhi?
Rhi: 1 stress.
Minna: 6!
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: Jesus, hot dice.
Kim: They missed us.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. So, yeah, they’re just like:
Rhi (as Alma): Oh, um, okay. Frank, come on, you have the-, where are the keys?
Rhi: And so, like, yeah, there’s some rummaging around drawers and they go over to the thing and open it up, and they’re like:
Rhi (as Alma): Er, is there a particular batch that you need? What’s the testing for?
Kim (as Blaire): There’s been word about a contamination that may have broken out, we’re trying to make sure if we don’t need to do a full recall or not.
Rhi (as Alma): Ooh. Wow, that would be really expensive.
Kim (as Blaire): Exactly. So, we could use one of refined, just to make sure that the best stuff isn’t, you know, contaminated at all.
Rhi (as Alma): Uh, yeah.
Rhi: So I think that there’s, like, kind of a lift system that they can use to move one of them down, and they’ll get it onto a dolly or something. They’re like:
Rhi (as Alma): Is there somebody here to pick you up?
Minna (as Myra): We got a ride arranged, don’t worry about it.
Rhi (as Alma): Okay, yeah, because, I mean, this would be…
Minna (as Myra): Oh, we’re not going to carry it across the city, don’t worry about it. [laughs]
Rhi (as Alma): I was gonna say, this would be miserable, getting back to the tower.
Minna (as Myra): Oh yeah.
Rhi (as Alma): Alright. And what did you say your name was, again?
Minna (as Myra): Althea.
Rhi (as Alma): Huh. Are you new?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, we’re pretty-, I’m pretty new.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m her assistant, Adelaide.
Rhi (as Alma): Oh, good to meet you both. Um, I should probably get the station chief and just have her sign off on this before you go.
Kim (as Blaire): Sure thing. I can wheel this out to our ride while you sign that.
Rhi (as Alma): Uh, we should before you take it out. Let me go grab her, just so that she can sign for it.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: So Alma leaves. Frank is still there, just kinda hanging out.
Kim: So what do we do?
Minna: We can either make a break for it, or sign off with the chief. I don’t know which one is going to be a better idea.
Kim: Well, did the chief see you when you first came in?
Minna: No?
Rhi: No.
Kim: Oh okay, then we’re good.
Minna: And I have fine cover identity, so I would have documentation forged.
Kim: Okay, I don’t have documentation.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: And if you don’t have documentation I can, like, scold you for having forgotten it.
Kim: That works.
Minna (as Myra): Must suck to be stuck on shift while the games are going on out there.
Rhi (as Frank): I mean, officially everybody’s supposed to be here. You know what? You should put this in your report, that the chief lets everybody go except, like, the two junior-most people. We’re supposed to hold down the fort here while the rest of them go have a day off. A paid day off, by the way.
Minna (as Myra): That’s very much against regulation, I’ll make a note of that. Thank you.
Rhi (as Frank): And it’s like, I don’t, you know, I get wanting to enjoy the show that’s happening right outside, but like, it shouldn’t be everybody expect the two of us.
Minna: Myra’s making notes in a little notebook.
Rhi: I think once you get him going on that, he’s just sort of venting about, like, all of the petty annoying stuff, just very standard workplace gripes.
Kim (as Blaire): They don’t even have dental.
Rhi: [laughs] This is Duskwall, no one has any kind of insurance, are you kidding me?
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, so Frank just, sort of, vents about workplace-, most of which is not actually that bad, it’s just like:
Rhi (as Frank): And the guy that I have to share an office with? He whistles. Constantly.
Minna (as Myra): Ugh.
Rhi (as Frank): Just under his breath. And I’ve told the chief how annoying it is and how distracting it is, but she hasn’t done anything about it. She says I just need to get over it.
Rhi: Minx, you are in a position where you can see the doors are open.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, I think I’m just gonna double check, make sure people out here can’t see our faces as we leave. Like, it’s still obscured by the puppet show and stuff. And, I dunno, I wanna make sure our Cabbie people pull up.
Rhi: I think, like, leaning against a lamppost is the Cabbie, just kinda hanging out casually, and you make eye contact and do the nod of acknowledgement. Yeah, yeah, I think otherwise you can just kinda hang out and be ready for things. So, yeah, after a few minutes you hear footsteps coming and Frank, like, clams up real fast. And Alma comes back with-, let’s see, I didn’t really think about this person. Well here, I will pass the responsibility off to somebody else. Minna, tell me what the station chief looks like.
Minna: Um… I think she has dark skin and her hair in bunch of thin braids gathered into a ponytail at the back of her head.
Rhi: Okay, cool. And she is also wearing the, kind of like, general Sparkwright getup. There’s a lot of patches on her stuff and some, like, burned bits. But yeah, she comes in and is like:
Rhi (as Station Chief): Alma here says that you have to remove one of the barrels for testing?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, we’re chasing up a possible contamination issue.
Rhi (as Station Chief): Hmm.
Minna (as Myra): Trying to keep it under wraps, but yeah. We’re hoping it doesn’t pan out to anything. We’re starting small.
Rhi (as Station Chief): Yeah, well that would be real bad for the Hunters, wouldn’t it? Do you have your papers? I just need to make sure everything’s in order.
Minna (as Myra): Oh yeah.
Minna: She pulls out some identification papers.
Rhi: Alright, I think you’re gonna need to make another Sway to convince this person that you are doing what you’re supposed to be doing. Still risky, but you’re going to be at greater effect because of your fine documents.
Minna: I rolled a 5.
Rhi: Okay. Alright. So, she looks at your papers for a second and is like:
Rhi (as Station Chief): Okay, let me just get the log book which is in my office. I’ll be right back.
Rhi: And she starts to walk towards the hallway that you came from.
Minna: Hmm.
Rhi: Where Wester is unconscious in a door.
Josie: Hmm.
Kim: Ah, fuck.
Rhi: So. You convince her, but there is a complication. In that she is about thirty seconds away from finding a sleeping man.
Kim: What do we do?
Minna: I can just, yeah, I can always say that he, like, went his own way and I don’t know what happened to him.
Kim: Do you think he woke up between now and waited? That’s unlikely, I think.
Rhi: No, no, it’s only been a few minutes.
Minna: Let me look at slumber essence, but I think you can be woken up like normal.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: But we don’t want her to.
Minna: They sleep for an hour, deeply, but they can be roused with some effort.
Rhi: Okay. Okay, so…
Kim: So what do we do? What do we do, Minna?
Minna: I think we just hold tight and hope.
Kim: That’s a terrible plan.
Rhi: [giggles]
Josie: I say knock out the one guy who’s there and just bolt.
Rhi: Well, there’s two people back here now. Alma came back. So you have Alma and Frank to deal with.
Kim: But its two vs two. Do you think?
Minna: I dunno. Yeah, because I don’t want to get caught up in a whole thing about Wester and, like, getting him out of here too.
Kim: And just having the question of being like, ‘Hey, why is there an unconscious guy I don’t recognise in my hallway?’
Minna: Yeah, okay, I don’t like it, but…
Kim: So what do you say? You take one, I take one, we try to bolt with this barrel?
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Okay. Okay, we’re doing this.
Rhi: She walks down the hall, and I think goes around a curve, and you hear:
Rhi (as Station Chief): What the hell?
Rhi: And I think that’s like, the two other workers are kind of like looking in that direction, a little distracted. So that would be a good time for you two to–
Kim: So what I think we should do is just try and knock them out over the head with, you know, what’s something you can knock off your load?
Minna: Yeah I think we’re gonna have to do that.
Rhi: Alright, yeah, so gimme some rolls.
Kim: I’m going to mark a fine lightning hook off my load.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Um, this would be Skirmish, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Okay.
Minna: I think I’m gonna mark an unusual weapon, I think she has some kind of baton.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Do I hear any commotion?
Rhi: No, but if you’re keeping an eye on the situation, you can see both Myra and Blaire draw weapons. So, yeah, you can see that things are going off the rails.
Josie: Okay, well fortunately this area’s obscured and our Cabbie person is right here. So, I think I’m just gonna run in and start getting the keg out.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so let’s start with the Skirmish rolls, which will probably happen as you’re sprinting in.
Kim: What did you get, Minna?
Minna: I haven’t rolled yet.
Kim: Oh, I rolled already.
Rhi: Okay, what did you get?
Kim: 4.
Minna: What would a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Ooh. Um, Wester wasn’t bluffing about The Bluecoats being on their way.
Minna: Oh, fuck me. Yes.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Womp womp.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Why is this happening?
Minna: I rolled a 6 though.
Rhi: Okay, great. So Myra, you just clock your person upside the head.
Minna: Yeah, I think I clock Alma upside the head or something.
Rhi: Blaire, you hit him with the lightning hook and it zaps him real good, but he has just a bunch of random metal bits on his person, so some of the lightning arcs back and hits you, and you take level 1 harm, Zapped.
Kim: Okay, I’ll take that, that’s fine.
Rhi: Yeah. So you’re mildly electrocuted.
Kim: I can deal, I can deal.
Rhi: But both of them, like, they both make a little bit of noise, but not so much that the station chief is going to come running back to be like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’
Kim: Alright. So, at this point, though, we gotta start wheeling out that barrel.
Rhi: Yeah. So I think Minx has made it in just as those two people fall. And I think that I will need basically a group Prowl from the three of you to just hustle this thing outta here.
Kim: Okay.
Josie: Okey dokey.
Minna: Who has stress to spare?
Josie: I have 2 stress.
Minna: Can you lead?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky because The Bluecoats are heading in the direction of the station house.
Josie: I got a 5.
Kim: I got a 4 and a 1.
Rhi: Okay, so a 4.
Minna: I got a 1.
Rhi: And a 1. Okay, so you’re gonna take 1 point of stress, Minx, for covering for Myra, and the result is a 5. Okay. So I’m gonna give you all a choice.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: You either have reduced effect, meaning that you do not make it. You make it about halfway to where you need to be, with The Bluecoats closing in. Or, as you are rushing this barrel along over bumpy ground, the stopper comes loose.
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: It doesn’t fall out completely, but it’s loose, and refined electroplasm is starting to leak out and drip onto the cart and onto the ground.
Kim: And that would probably leave a trail, right?
Rhi: Little bit.
Minna: Is refined electroplasm dangerous?
Rhi: Uh, I mean…
Kim: In those small drops it can’t be, right?
Rhi: I wouldn’t ingest it.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: But here’s my other concern though, is that I know Lord Scurlock is a man for details. He might notice that, you know, the stopper came loose and a few drops are missing, right?
Rhi: He might.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: We might need those precious drops.
Josie: I think we should just, like, get halfway and roll again.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Alright, so yeah, the three of you start pushing and wow, this is way heavier than you realised, holy crap. So, you are not moving nearly as fast as you expected you would be. And you can hear, kind of, some shouting from the front of the Sparkwright station. The Bluecoats have arrived and are starting to move in.
Minna: Is there any, like, really distinctive way to know by hearing that The Bluecoats have arrived? I assume they don’t have sirens.
Rhi: I could see them having a bell. Like, a bell that’s distinct.
Minna: Oh, like a hand bell. Ding ding, ding ding, ding ding, kind of bells.
Rhi: Yeah, I’ve said the brigade uses bells to alert people when there’s a fire, I could see The Bluecoats having something.
Minna: So, I think Myra groans:
Minna (as Myra): Ugh, he wasn’t lying.
Josie: Can I have a smoke bomb as an unusual weapon? I feel like I’ve asked this question before, I forget if that’s allowed or not.
Rhi: Um, I think I had said that you would need to burn a point of stress to get it in a flashback, from Seeks.
Josie: Yeah, I think I’m gonna do that to have a smoke bomb that I can just throw behind us, basically.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: That’s good cover, okay.
Rhi: Yeah, go ahead and make a roll to throw a smoke bomb.
Josie: I’ll Skirmish that shit, I guess? I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think what happens, I’m gonna go with a complication for this. You throw the smoke bomb. Poof, smoke billowing out everywhere. You’ve just set off a smoke bomb at a festival, circus-type setup, where there’s already a lot of fire-adjacent things happening. This causes a bit of a panic, so now there’s a lot of people running away, and it sort of provides cover, but it mostly just slows you down further.
Josie: Ugh, okay.
Rhi: So you’re gonna be at reduced effect to start with on your next roll to get this out of here.
Josie: God dammit.
Rhi: But, you have created a lot of cover for yourself. You are obscured by both the smoke and the crowd now, so you’ve bought yourself some time.
Kim: I think we should do our next group Prowl then.
Josie: Yeah, let’s do it.
Rhi: Who’s gonna lead?
Josie: I’ll lead again.
Rhi: Alright.
Kim: I can bring us to greater effect if I accepted a Devil’s Bargain though, right?
Minna: Yes.
Josie: Oh yeah, what’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Oh, interesting.
Kim: Because I’ve run out of spaces to really push myself before I take trauma.
Rhi: Yeah. Devil’s Bargain, Devil’s Bargain, Devil’s Bargain.
Kim: Does a Devil’s Bargain be that I take another level of harm, or…
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, I think that’s gonna be the easiest.
Minna: You trip in the smoke. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, or this thing is heavy and you, like, wrench an arm doing something, trying to push this along. I think that’ll be it.
Kim: Sprain my wrist?
Rhi: Yeah, Sprained Wrist, level one harm.
Kim: Okay, along with Zapped.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re just getting kinda battered.
Kim: That’s okay.
Rhi: But yeah, you can use that to move the group up to standard effect.
Josie: I got a 2.
Rhi: Oof.
Kim: Oh my God, I also got a 2.
Minna: I got a 4.
Josie: Oh, thank you.
Rhi: Okay [laughs] so that’s 2 points of stress to Minx.
Josie: Uh huh.
Rhi: Okay, so you make it to the cab, you make it to the carriage. I’m thinking either you all take some harm from, just like, the strain of hefting this thing, or we go back to the complication of some of the electroplasm starts spilling.
Josie: I’m okay with spraining something.
Kim and Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. You can pick the limb. But everybody is gonna have a sprain of some kind, expect Blaire, who this is gonna be, because both of your level 1 harm slots are filled, it’s gonna be level 2 harm for Blaire. I think that, God, I think you like dislocate your shoulder.
Minna: [gasp] My baby! No!
Rhi: Like, it’s fixable, and you’re on your way out.
Kim: But it hurts like–
Rhi: But it hurts like hell.
Kim: Okay.
Josie: Mm-hmm. I think Minx hurts her back, because she’s the tallest and is trying to get it lifted in there.
Rhi: Yeah, and like, the cabbie is helping you. He helps heft this thing in, but like, it still weighs an enormous amount. So yeah, Minx and Myra are both taking level 1 harm, Blaire it’s level 2 harm. I think what happens is as you all are hefting this thing in, like, The Bluecoats start running towards you and drawing pistols and shouting and it’s like, ‘Oh God, we gotta go!’
Minna: I think Myra, like, briefly traps her fingers a little bit, so she has bruised fingers.
Rhi: Oh, oh no, the worst.
Minna: Yeah, yeah.
Kim: I think Blaire’s probably just taking on too much, than she knows she can lift, and you know, the stress of the The Bluecoats distracts her and her weight slips, and her shoulder dislocates.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Aw, we got through this whole score without getting hit, and this fucking barrel. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, you all like, pile into the cab and the Cabbie tears off down the street. But you all make it away. So, for payoff you earn 1 coin per Tier of the target. If you walked away without taking anything for yourselves, you earn zero coin. I think you earned zero coin.
Kim: We earn zero coin.
Rhi: The Gondoliers will pay you once you actually get The Lampblacks to back off.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So, let’s move into our downtime actions. Blaire, do you wanna go first?
Kim: Um, sure. I imagine this is probably at the docks. Blaire seeks out Setarra rather than summoning her. Setarra in the water, Blaire probably standing at the docks nearby, while Setarra just pores over this book with Blaire looking on.
Rhi: So, yeah, Setarra I think has been paging through this and, like, lays the book out on the docks, on the wooden boards of this pier that you’re standing on, and the pages that she has open-, it’s actually like, it’s something where the pages are, like, folded over, so when you open them up fully it folds out so it’s double the width of the book.
Kim: Oh, okay, yeah.
Rhi: And it’s just covered in a mix of mathematical equations and star charts and arcane symbols. And she’s just sort of looking at it, like, almost greedily.
Rhi (as Setarra): This is… you have brought me something truly valuable here, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): What does all this say? What does it mean?
Rhi (as Setarra): Are you familiar with summoning things not of this realm?
Kim (as Blaire): Um… I mean, besides you, no.
Rhi (as Setarra): You see, my kind, as strange as they may seem to you, are of this realm. We are natural. Elemental. We are the sea and the earth, we are stars and flame. But there are other realms, beyond this one that you and I walk in.
Rhi: And she kind of raises up on the water a little bit so that she’s more at eye level with you and she kind of moves her hands in front of her, and layers of water of different colours and depths are sort of hovering in the air before her. The central layer of water is the familiar deep ink of the void sea, but some of the other layers are, like, the bright glowing blue of electroplasm, or are totally crystal clear, or are just some other strange, bright colours.
Kim (as Blaire): How… how are you doing that?
Rhi (as Setarra): I have great command over water.
Kim (as Blaire): No, the colours, not all of this looks like it’s from the void.
Rhi (as Setarra): Some of it is not. The ghost field is not of this realm. It is separate, apart from this. It was supposed to remain separate, but it was pulled partly into our realm during the cataclysm.
Rhi: And as she speaks, there’s a glowing layer above the void sea layer, and that glowing layer kind of sinks partly into the black water of the void sea, and sort of gives it this bluish glow.
Rhi (as Setarra): But, there are other realms, farther realms, that are strange and alien, with knowledge and perception that we cannot even imagine. As yet, no one has found a way to move from our realm to one of these others. But if you prepare correctly, if you send out the right call–
Rhi: And as she’s talking, a droplet falls from one of those brightly coloured water layers into the void sea and falls and sends ripples out.
Rhi (as Setarra): –something from another world can come to ours.
Kim (as Blaire): You really think we could do that?
Rhi (as Setarra): This book seems to have quite a lot of information about how we could bring such a thing here.
Kim (as Blaire): Wow.
Rhi (as Setarra): We could learn so much, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): What do we summon first?
Rhi (as Setarra): That will take further reading to see what this alchemist had uncovered, but we will find something suitable.
Rhi: And then she, kinda like, moves back down to the book and waves you down to start explaining the different symbols and runes and things. So.
Kim: That’s probably where the camera starts panning back.
Rhi: Yeah. So Blaire knows that she can summon aliens now.
Kim: Woo!
Josie: Neat.
Minna: Oh my God.
Josie: Time to summon great Cthulhu. Fhtagn, everyone!
Rhi: Yeah!
Kim: Aw [claps] yay.
Rhi: Yep.
Minna: That’s, uh, so much.
Rhi: Alright, so that’s what Blaire is doing with her downtime. Minx?
Josie: I think Minx is going to continue to enjoy her goth club outings, because I think it’s going to represent filling up that Rumours About Bazso clock. But yes, I’m gonna like, come in excited and very sure of myself and be like ‘I know. I know where it is’.
Rhi: Yeah, I think that you immediately get a cluster of these cultists from the same group that you’ve been hanging out with, they rush over and it’s like:
Rhi (as Cultist): What? What are you talking about?
Josie (as Minx): The hand. It’s with The Lampblacks.
Rhi: Yeah, there’s just like, people like:
Rhi (as Cultist): What, how? Are you sure? How do you know?
Josie (as Minx): I’m certain. I had tracked it to the docks before that hullabaloo, and now that they’ve moved in there, it is moved from its suspected spot, so they’ve taken it.
Rhi (as Cultist): I can’t believe it, I can’t believe that such a powerful relic would be in our city. Do you think…
Rhi: And then like, a couple of the people in this cluster sort of break off and are like, murmuring to each other. And you catch… let’s see, because you did get a critical, maybe I can give you a bit of extra information here. Hang on a second.
Josie: Ooh.
Rhi: So, yeah, the two of them move off and are whispering to each other, but you overhear like:
Rhi (as Cultist): Do you think we should tell Lady Drake?
Rhi (as second Cultist): No, no, go to Lady Penderyn, she’ll know what to do.
Josie: Interesting. Have we heard that name before, Penderyn?
Rhi: Er, Myra had some suspicions. Lady Eleanor Penderyn is married to one of the members of the city council. The Penderyn family is extremely powerful and wealthy and Myra had suspected that Lady Penderyn was part of The Circle of Flame.
Minna: I think because of the initials in the journal.
Rhi: Yes. The notes that you had found in their creepy basement cult room, there was some notes intialed ‘E.P.’ Yeah, you hear them mention both Lady Drake, who you know to be in The Circle, and Lady Penderyn, who you had suspected, who now it seems may also be involved. But yeah, those two people kinda hustle off pretty quickly to go tell certain people.
Josie: And then I think Minx is gonna enjoy the thrill of cavorting about secretly in black lace.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yes. So Minx, again, has a nice time with some goths and cultists.
Josie: Yeah!
Kim: Yay!
Rhi: Yay! Okay, so Myra. What do you do with your time?
Minna: I don’t know why it amuses me that she’d be in, like, the middle of cleaning common areas of The Nest.
Kim: Aw, that’s cute though. Blaire is already, I imagine, cleaning up in her room anyway, maybe she finished a project. So she’s wiping her hands, and she’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay.
Kim: She’s probably gonna start rubbing a cloth over the main table or something.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): So, I’ve been meaning to ask. Who was that guy that you, you know, knocked out back at the score?
Minna (as Myra): Oh, that’s a very old-, I hesitate to use the word friend. We used to work with Salia together. He still does, and thinks I’m a fool for leaving I’m sure, but yes, he’s very basically a malicious little twit who’s got a little bit too much power now.
Kim (as Blaire): Urgh.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Yeah, he said some things that, I dunno, I suppose they might be a concern to the group as a whole.
Kim (as Blaire): Like what?
Minna (as Myra): It sounds as if Salia is not quite done with me. At least she believes so. Which means that she could very well be looking at all of us as potential targets. I don’t know what good this will bring her, or how she would intend to come at me, but maybe something to be aware of.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, you don’t think she’s gonna, like, come after us or anything, right? Try and recruit all of us? Recruit you again?
Minna (as Myra): Well, I dunno. She might still see me as hers by right.
Kim (as Blaire): But you’re not. You’re ours. And you’re your own person.
Minna (as Myra): Try telling Salia that people belong to themselves.
Kim (as Blaire): I wouldn’t much care to, I don’t know the lady.
Minna (as Myra): She’s not a person that you’d wanna meet, I think.
Kim (as Blaire): I agree.
Minna (as Myra): Anyway, there’s that to be aware of.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t think that’s something that’s gonna hail down on us any time soon, do you?
Minna (as Myra): I will say he did sound as if things, as if something would be happening soon. I’m not particularly excited to find out what that is, but we have so many things that we know about that we can start dealing with that I don’t even know how to start dealing with the threat that we don’t know about.
Kim (as Blaire): He could have been bluffing.
Minna (as Myra): I suppose he could have, but he seemed a little bit too smug for just a bluff. You learn to read people’s faces when you live with them for so long.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, with The Circle of Flame off our backs, it probably won’t be too much of a trouble for us.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I think we should concentrate on The Circle of Flame. I just, there’s not so much I can do without information, you know?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I hear ya.
Rhi: We pull away from that scene and move up through Six Towers, up to the Scurlock Manor, where a Cabbie has again dropped you off. And a couple of servants have actually emerged from the manor and are-, we didn’t, hang on. We didn’t establish if you actually got a heart. Let me make a roll real fast.
Kim: Yeah, no, we need that.
Rhi: You have a heart! I rolled a 6.
Kim: Woo! Yay.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: They get you a heart. Well, they get you a body.
Kim: I dissected the heart.
Rhi: Oh, great. You got a heart.
Josie: Minx is several rooms away.
Kim: Wow, that’s probably what Blaire was cleaning up from too, she just finished the dissection.
Minna and Rhi: Noooo!
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: [laughs] God, it was! You did an autopsy in your bedroom.
[laughter]
Kim: It’s big enough.
Minna: No, are there spaces you could do that in The Nest? Like inside the vault?
Josie: [singing] This is fine.
Kim: But all my tools are in my room and I probably have a sterile space, it’s definitely big enough. I was sure I would have privacy and ensure full concentration, it’s fine. The body is disposed of. I’m not keeping the body in my room because that would stink. But yeah, no, Blaire definitely did the dissection.
Rhi: Cool. Cool. Cool.
Kim: [laughs] Cool cool cool cool cool.
Rhi: Anyway. So, I think you show up in a cab, one of The Cabbies gives you all a ride over there with your barrel of leviathan blood, and I imagine you have some sort of box to hold the heart in. And you are greeted again at the front door by Oskar, who looks kind of apologetic and says:
Rhi (as Oskar): Sorry, my uncle has other matters to attend to and could not come here to thank you for your efforts personally, but he did give me this.
Rhi: And he holds out a very finely carved and engraved wooden box, that he holds out to Blaire.
Kim: She takes it.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you. It’s really appreciated.
Rhi: It has like a sliding lid, so you could open it up and see.
Kim: Yeah, I’m gonna take a look.
Rhi: Alright. So you slide it open, and inside is a skeletal human arm, from about the elbow to the hand, that all the bones are held together with fine silver wire.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: And there are runes etched into the bones that are, like, then filled in with silver. It looks very cool.
Kim: And it probably looks very cursed.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. It looks spooky as hell.
Kim: Nice.
Rhi: And in effect, like, if you were for some reason to hang onto this or try to do anything with it, it basically has the same effect as a fine spirit mask. It lets you see into the ghost field better.
Kim: Oh, alright. That’s not that exciting.
Rhi: It’s mildly magical, but it’s not, you know, the super-powered relic that everyone is looking for.
Kim: It’s mysterious-looking enough.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Blaire closes the box and:
Kim (as Blaire): This’ll do great, thank you.
Rhi (as Oskar): I will pass your thanks along next time I see him. Good luck with whatever it is that you’re doing.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you. And here are the goods, of course, delivered as promised.
Rhi (as Oskar): Ah, yes. Much appreciated.
Kim: I like to imagine a couple of us are carrying what, like one person has the salt, one person, I guess me, has the heart, and someone is barrelling over the barrel.
Rhi: I think that a couple servants come out to collect the barrel, so that’s being taken care of in the background, but yeah, he will take the bag of salt and then whatever the heart is in–
Kim: The box.
Rhi: –and kinda makes a little bit of a face as he takes it, and is like:
Rhi (as Oskar): Thank you, I’ll get these to him as quickly as I can, particularly this one.
Rhi: And he, like, taps the box.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Rhi (as Oskar): Certainly.
Rhi: So, the three of you, on a job well done, make your way back to The Hound’s Paw to have some celebratory drinks. You head inside and again, this is sort of, I’m figuring, midday, so not a ton of customers. A few staff members around, including Sophia. But Rigney is not there. There’s somebody else, one of his employees is manning the bar today.
Minna: Oh no.
Kim (as Blaire): Um, hey, Sophia?
Josie (as Minx): Sophia, where’s Rigney?
Rhi: So, yeah, she comes over and is like:
Rhi (as Sophia): Oh good, there you are. Do you want your usual drinks?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, yes, although–
Kim (as Blaire): Where’s Rigney?
Rhi (as Sophia): Oh, he’s out sick today. He just said he was not feeling well.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay, well I hope he feels better. We were worried.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps we should send a card.
Rhi (as Sophia): He seemed to be just under the weather the past few days, not feeling very well. I’m not sure what, but yes, hopefully with some rest he will be better. Oh, he did–
Rhi: And she, kinda like, reaches into the pockets of the apron she’s wearing and pulls out a folded piece of paper and is like:
Rhi (as Sophia): He left this with a note saying to give this to you as soon as possible. It is from a Mr Harker.

## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. This is an episode that I have been looking forward to for a long, long time. Fair warning, this episode gets pretty heavy emotionally speaking so it might be one to listen to at home rather than the car, or at work, or the gym.
As always, if you like the show there are lots of ways to support us. Backing us on Patreon is one. You can get access to our Secret Archive and at higher levels you can submit Devil’s Bargains and NPCs for us to use in the show or gain access to tabletop content that will let you incorporate elements from The magpies into your Blades in the Dark game. If Patreon support isn’t for you, then leave us a review and tell your friends about the show. Spreading the word is a great way to support us.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s Featured Charity.
The National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center is a non-profit dedicated to supporting indigenous women in the United States who are facing domestic violence as well as helping Native American tribes and tribal organizations better respond to domestic violence. Their goals are to show that offenders will be held accountable and that native women and children are entitled to safety from violence within their homes and in their community, justice both on and off tribal lands, and access to services designed by and for native women based on their tribal beliefs and practices. Visit www.niwrc.org/donate to support their work. There will be a link to their site in the show notes.
If you’re in the US please continue to visit 5calls.org and contact your representatives about the many issues facing our country. Outside the US, I don’t have immediate resources to point to, but there’s more than enough darkness and uncertainty and harm spread across the world. Learn about what’s going on where you live and what you can do about it.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:10]
Rhi: Sophia came over and told you all that Rigney had asked her to give you a note that had come in from Mr. Harker, so we’re gonna start with, just at the table, Sophia has brought the three of you your drinks and she is holding out this note.
Josie: Minx will take it and use a letter opener on it delicately.
Rhi: [chuckles] The letter opener is fancier than the entire letter itself. It’s on cheap paper that has a mug stain in one corner where something was set and spilled and left a brownish ring in one corner, like he spilled tea on it. It’s a very short message written in Harker’s familiar scrawl. “Minx. Might have gotten into a bit of trouble. Weird things happening since I delivered that message for you. People following me. Got a bad feeling. Come by my place as soon as you get this. Harker.”
Josie: Oh dear.
Minna: Oh…
Kim (as Blaire): What’s that all about?
Josie: Hmm. Actually, refresh my memory. What’s the message he’s talking about? It was for when we were framing…
Rhi: You were framing Brogan as having betrayed the Circle of Flame. You fabricated some evidence that Brogan had hired all of you to assassinate Avrathi and that you were planning on assassinating Lady Drake next. You paid Harker to take that information to Salia.
Josie: Hmm. Right.
Josie (as Minx): Well, it seems that our involving Harker in that Brogan business may have had some consequences. Would you all care to join me? I feel like we may need backup for this.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. I think that would be a good idea.
Kim (as Blaire): Well yeah, yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Let’s try not to look too worried. Let’s not tip off any prying eyes.
Minna (as Myra): Of course not.
Kim (as Blaire): Totes casual.
[chuckling]
Rhi: Are the three of you just gonna head out right now?
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay. Sophia watches you all go, looking kind of worried as the three of you head out. I was figuring that Harker lives in Silkshore.
Josie: makes sense.
Rhi: Silkshore is an area of town where the income level of the residents varies wildly. You have people living in really glamorous penthouses and then you have people living in the kind of place that Harker is in which is basically just a crappy basement studio. You get to the street where Harker’s building is. It looks pretty normal for Silkshore. Everyone’s going about their daily business. You head into his building and down the stairs, and immediately you know that something is wrong when you see the door, because there is splintered wood around the doorknob where it looks like it was kicked in.
Josie: Uh-oh. I’m going to try to gingerly with my cane push the door open.
Rhi: All right. The door creeks as it opens. It opens about a third of the way and then thumps into something, like there’s something on the other side of the door blocking it.
Minna: [nervous noises]
Kim (as Blaire): [apprehensively] Hello?
Rhi: There’s no response.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, oh geez, oh geez.
Josie (as Minx): I’ll go in first.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm!
Rhi: Okay. Minx, you step inside, and Harker is not the best housekeeper. There’s always sort of an organized mess in his place. Even with that, you can tell this place has been trashed. Furniture is upended. There are clothes strewn across the floor. What is blocking the door is an overturned table. There’s broken cutlery and plates and stuff scattered across the floor. There’s kind of a rotting food smell, and you can see on the floor there’s a plate that’s fallen onto some food that’s started to go off.
Josie (as Minx): Oh hells.
Minna (as Myra): How old is this message?
Josie (as Minx): I’m not certain, but it must be days at least if the rot has set in.
Minna (as Myra): Yes…
Josie: Minx is gonna progressively more frantically try to look for any clues of who may have been here.
Rhi: Yeah, if you wanna go ahead and—So, obviously this is kind of a mystery that I have set out here for you, so looking for clues is Gathering Information. That’s how it’s gonna work mechanically, so you can make any kind of rolls you want and it will be Gathering Info.
Kim: Okay.
Josie: Okay. I’m gonna make a case for rolling Consort about this, because I know what would be out of place knowing Harker.
Rhi: Yeah, I will allow that.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. Looking for things that are out of place, like everything is out of place, it’s just been tossed. You see tossed over the end of the bed is the shabby silk jacket and top hat that Harker wears when he is working at the Sparkfields. It seems like it happened after that, because he has that stuff out. You can ask follow-up questions also if there are specific things you’re looking for.
Josie: Actually, I was gonna ask Blaire to check the ghost field.
Kim: I was just thinking about that. Yeah. I was wondering if rolling Attune would give me an idea of what may have happened here.
Rhi: Yeah, definitely.
Josie: Read the energy of the room.
Kim: Oh, it’s definitely possessed.
Rhi: [laughs] The whole room.
Kim: My highest was a 5.
Rhi: You put on your spirit mask and look into the ghost field. You can’t really see anything super clearly, these are echoes of events in the ghost field. The only reason that it is visible is because there was a lot of strong emotion happening. You don’t really see any of the physical objects, but you can see people moving. You see a shape sitting at the table where the plate of fallen food is sort of jerking upright, getting to its feet as several other figures stream into the room. A few of them fan out and start moving as if they’re throwing things around. The rest close in on presumably Harker. There seems to be kind of a struggle that ends with Harker’s image in the ghost field fading a little bit but it doesn’t disappear. Then everything else kind of fades out. The scene ‘ends” with everyone just sort of disappearing, because that’s where the memory of the ghost field ends. It looks like a number of people broke in, trashed the place, attacked Harker, and you’re guessing knocked him out.
Kim: Hopefully.
Josie (as Minx): yes. At least, judging by their lack of subtlety, he’s likely alive.
Kim (as Blaire): Alive, but I don’t know, he could be really hurt.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Myra, do you… Since he delivered the message to them, could it be this Salia character?
Minna (as Myra): Oh… Oh no. that might be…
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] I know Salia’s got something going on that relates to, well, me, but us, clearly. So maybe…
Minna: Myra’s gonna start looking for signs that confirm this and also that might give some kind of clue for where they went.
Josie (as Minx): I would also like to point out that Wester and Harker were at the Sparkwright festival. It’s possible he observed me talking to the fellow.
Minna (as Myra): They’re also in the business of gathering information and selling it, basically, so who knows how she found out that Harker was connected to us, but if she did, she could, she could do this.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know why.
Josie (as Minx): Now it’s still possible that it could be the Circle proper.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I’m hoping it’s just that.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re hoping it’s the Circle instead of the apprentices?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I generally don’t think of the Circle as “just” the Circle.
Minna (as Myra): “Just” the Circle as in only fighting on one front. I don’t need these people to be helping these other people who hate us. That would make things worse.
Josie (as Minx): That is understandable.
Kim (as Blaire): I’ve got a feeling though that if it was the Circle that took him they’d be doing a lot worse things to him.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. No, for Harker’s sake I suppose, I don’t know what they would want him for.
Minna: Correct me if I’m wrong, but abducting people is not usually Salia’s first strategy?
Rhi: No. That is Salia getting her hands way dirtier than she ever did. She deals in information. This is a lot more involved and hands on than she usually gets.
Josie (as Minx): It’s possible that she learned the information we fed was false and this is… punishment?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know why she would care that much.
Kim (as Blaire): Or maybe she’s just trying to get to you, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know what’s happening, and I don’t… I don’t—
Minna: Sorry, I rolled a 3 by the way, so Myra’s just like:
Minna (as Myra): I don’t see anything. I don’t…
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I suppose we must keep our wits about.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna look for any safe places or hidey holes Harker might have kept, not because she’s intending on taking his stuff but in case he hid something in the event of his disappearance or something, or try to find his safes or hidey holes.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, you worked with Harker long enough to know. He didn’t live in this place when you were a kid. This is somewhat more recent. You know his habits and where he stashes stuff, so I won’t necessarily have you roll for this. You check the dresser that he’s had forever that you know one of the drawers has a secret compartment in the back, and you check that. The dresser drawers have been yanked open and everything but nobody went into that secret compartment, so he has some coin stashed in there. You poke around at the floorboards until you find the one that’s loose and pry that up and he has some more money, and a couple changes of clothes, and a fake identity. He’s got a couple stashes of “in the event that I need to leave the city in a hurry, I can just grab this and go,” but nothing that seems to connect to this.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: As you’re all searching and looking around you hear the floorboards in the hallway outside creek.
[nervous noises]
Josie: I’m gonna try to stealthily position myself next to the door, cane at the ready.
Rhi: All right. The other two of you?
Kim: Um… I’m gonna hang back for now.
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna be the decoy to let Minx surprise them, so she’s gonna stand real visible from the doorway.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, you move so that you can see into the hallway, and staring back at you is a wide-eyed girl in her early teens, looks like she’s probably 13 or 14. She’s wearing raggedy and mismatched clothing. It’s clean, it’s well-kept. She has a satchel over her shoulder and she’s clutching the strap as she stares at you, just looking very surprised.
Minna (as Myra): Hello. Are you here for Harker?
Rhi (as Girl): Uh… Yeah. I was looking for M-Mr. Harker… H-He said come round if I needed work. Sometimes he has jobs for me. Uh…
Josie: I think Minx is gonna take a few steps back and slowly reveal herself so I’m away from the door and not gonna startle her.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, you know that was Harker’s sort of standard operating procedure with his army of street urchins. He wasn’t super controlling of the kids, it was just sort of hey, if you need work come and see me, I will hook you up with things, in exchange I’m taking a cut of whatever you get because I set you up with the job, but if you don’t want to work for me anymore that’s fine, go do your own thing. This sounds like a similar sort of setup. She glances over at Minx also, she’s just looking concerned.
Josie (as Minx): We were looking for Mr. Harker as well. It seems there’s been a spot of trouble. What’s your name, by the way? Or what do you go by rather?
Rhi (as Girl): Uh… M-My names Philla, but m-most folks just call me Rabbit.
Minna and Kim: (happy squeaking)
Josie (as Minx): Rabbit. Nice to meet you, Rabbit. I am Minx. We are The Magpies.
Josie: I’m gonna slowly approach.
Josie (as Minx): I used to be in your position not too long ago. It seems as though Harker might be out for a time, but…
Josie: I’m gonna hand her a Magpies pin and a place to contact us, essentially.
Josie (as Minx): …come around here if you are still in need of work in a few days.
Rhi (as Rabbit): All right…
Rhi: She’s leaning, trying to peer into the room past the two of you.
Kim (as Blaire): Y-You probably don’t want to go in there. It’s kind of a mess.
Rhi (as Rabbit): Is he all right?
Kim (as Blaire): We don’t know.
Josie (as Minx): He… is out there somewhere, and we intend to find him.
Rhi (as Rabbit): Okay. Um…
Kim (as Blaire): Are you hungry? We can give you something for the road.
Rhi (as Rabbit): No, I’m all right. Do you know when this all happened?
Josie (as Minx): A day or two ago it appears like.
Kim (as Blaire): At least this week. We don’t know for sure.
Rhi (as Rabbit): Well, because I came by a few days ago and I was gonna see Mr. Harker for a job, but there were these, uh, all these people in these real nice black coats with real shiny brass buttons, an di figured they had some more important business with him, so I just went on my way.
Minna: Uh… Does that sound like a familiar description at all?
Rhi: Yeah, you know, The Umbra Hunters wear black jackets with brass buttons.
Minna: Ohhh good. Okay. I think Myra’s gonna straighten and say:
Minna (as Myra): What did these people look like besides the black jackets?
Rhi: Now you’re gonna need to give me a roll.
Minna: Yeah. Absolutely. Is it a Consort?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: She’s still trying to seem friendly. I rolled a 6.
Rhi (as Rabbit): Well, they… [exhales] I mean, you’ve been around a while. You know how people move when they’re trying to not show what they got hidden under their coats? Truncheons and whatever?
Josie (as Minx): Right.
Rhi (as Rabbit): They were kind of like that. It’s the reason I left. They looked like they were after something real important.
Minna (as Myra): So they looked like trouble? You got anything a little more detail?
Rhi: What are you looking for specifically?
Minna: Are they just Umbra Hunters or are they intermixed Umbra Hunters and apprentices like it was with Ojal?
Rhi: She describes some of the people. She doesn’t seem to have committed them to memory very well, but none of the descriptions sound like anybody that you know.
Minna: Good. Okay. Good to know.
Kim (as Blaire): Did you see anything more that happened?
Rhi (as Rabbit): No. I just saw them go into the building and figured I’d try and find something else. I had some other jobs around the city and was just coming back now to check in with him.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well it was a good instinct to leave that to later, and thank you for talking with us.
Josie: I think I do want to slip her a coin, just so today was not a total waste.
Rhi: Yeah. She does that thing that I think is very familiar to both Minx and Myra. She snatches the money and it just vanishes into her clothing. She’s got little hidden pouches and whatever everywhere to keep her money safe.
Rhi (as Rabbit): All right, um…
Rhi: She looks at the Magpie pin and pins it onto the strap of her satchel.
Kim & Josie: Aw!
Rhi (as Rabbit): I’ll come by in a few days to see if you know anything.
Kim (as Blaire): Our doors will be open to you.
Rhi (as Rabbit): I sure hope he’s all right.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll find him.
Josie (as Minx): We as well.
Rhi: And she scurries off.
Josie (as Minx): Safe travels, Rabbit.
Rhi: She waves at you over her shoulder.
Kim: [smiling] Oh my God, I love her.
Josie (as Minx): Suddenly I’m feeling nostalgic.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well it wasn’t so long ago that I was the one approaching Harker’s door.
Minna (as Myra): We will find him, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): I know we will. It is more what this portends for the future.
Kim (as Blaire): If the apprentices are behind it, we’ll get them off your back too, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know that they are. The description sounded more like The Umbra Hunters, and this was related to Brogan. It’s possible this is just his revenge.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm. Although I thought The Umbra Hunters were defunked.
Minna (as Myra): The Umbra Hunters as they exist now are Brogan’s bully boys.
Rhi: They were, but Brogan is now in prison and you don’t know how much control he still has over them. You do know that someone else who has not been publically named is running The Centuralia Club, so it’s unclear if The Umbra Hunters are still answering to Brogan, if he’s running them from Ironhook, or if whoever runs the club—You’re pretty sure that whoever runs the club is still part of the Circle, you just don’t know who it is.
Minna (as Myra): Maybe a good place to start is to see what direction they went after they left.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. We should check around the area before spreading out.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: How do you all want to go about gathering info? You could just do a group Consort action if you wanted and that will cover all of you knocking on doors and talking to neighbors and things.
Kim: Yeah, that makes the most sense to me.
Josie: Yeah, that’s the simplest I think.
Minna: Sure. Who’s gonna lead it?
Josie: I will lead it.
Minna: Okay. That’s another 6.
Josie: I got a critical.
Kim: I got a 6.
Minna: Oh my gosh.
Rhi: Jesus!
Kim: Woohoo.
Rhi: Okay, um…
Minna: Our lowest was a 6.
Josie: Phew… These guys were not being subtle.
Rhi: Yeah. The first few people you talk to are like “no, I was out that day, I didn’t see anything,” and then you are talking to some people outside the building, you’re across the street, and you find a kindly grandmother…
Kim: [cheers]
Rhi: …who spends her days sitting by the front window that looks directly out at Harker’s building, knitting.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: Not only is she going to tell you what she saw, but she is going to invite you in and feed you cookies.
Minna: [gasps]
Josie: Yes.
Kim: YES! I was just gonna ask do we get cookies!
Rhi: You definitely get cookies.
Kim: Yay!
Josie: The gang got sidetracked for a while. [laughs]
Kim: Duskwall is good for once!
Rhi: [laughs] I think the other benefit is that she will invite you in and give you cookies, but she also can tell that you all are in a hurry and does get to the point.
Kim: Does she have a cat?
Rhi: Yeah, of course, she has like three.
Kim: AH! Blaire pets all three of them.
[laughter]
Rhi: While you are petting her cats and eating her cookies, she tells you… If you ask did you see a group of people go into the building across the way, she’s like:
Rhi (as Grandmother): Oh yes, yes I saw. It is not uncommon to see large gangs prowling around. You know, back in my day, when I was you rage, I may have been mixed up in some of that sort of thing.
Minna (as Myra): [smiling] Were you indeed?
Josie (as Minx): Ooh~?
Rhi (as Grandmother): So I assumed that they had some business with someone in that building, and then a little while later they came out and a couple of them were carrying this very large satchel between them. it looked very heavy. They headed… There was a carriage a little way down the street, and they all got into the carriage with that satchel of theirs, and they headed, uh… oh, they headed east towards the bridge over into Crow’s Foot.
Minna (as Myra): Hmm…
Rhi (as Grandmother): Would you like another cookie, dear?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, please.
[laughter]
Rhi: Minx is stress-eating.
Kim: [pretends to talk with her mouth full]
Josie: Although that won’t stop her from talking knitting with her.
Rhi: Oh yeah.
Josie: All right. That was a pleasant diversion.
Rhi: Yeah.
[laughter]
Rhi (as Grandmother): Good luck you three. Here, here’s a little bag of cookies for the road.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you~!
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): And thank you for letting me pet your cats~!
Rhi (as Grandmother): Oh, well thank you for petting them. they don’t get nearly enough attention if you listen to them.
[laughter]
Minna (as Myra): Aren’t cats just like that?
Rhi: One of the cats flops over and meows dramatically.
Minna: [groans suggesting “too much cute!”]
[laughter]
Rhi: All right. The bridge that she mentioned, there is only one major bridge between Silkshore and Crow’s Foot. You all came across the bridge when you were coming over here, so that is presumably the direction that they went.
Minna: The problem is they could be going almost anywhere. The only thing we know is they didn’t go to Barrowcleft and Dunslough, because Crow’s Foot, from that way you could also get through Charterhall to Six Towers, so that doesn’t necessarily narrow it down but we can definitely ask people along the route.
Josie: Right. Although Crow’s Foot is also Lampblacks territory, right?
Rhi: It is, but it is also The Crows.
Minna: And, it’s also where Salia operates partly.
Josie: Hmm.
Kim: Oh goodie!
Minna: That’s only one. She has locations all over the place, just mostly the apprentices hang out in Crow’s Foot.
Rhi: On your way over you did see some members of The Crows harassing people as they were coming into Crow’s Foot. You all barely paid it any mind, because it’s fairly normal for The Crows to try to shake people down for, you know, a bridge toll. As you’re leaving the bridge a couple people, clearly part of The Crows because they have crow’s feathers pinned to their lapels, step in front of you.
Rhi (as Crow): If you want to stay under The Crows’ protection while you’re in here we ask for a small contribution to our efforts, otherwise these streets are awful dangerous. Who knows what could happen?
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks, but we don’t need protection.
Minna (as Myra): [quietly] Blaire—
Josie (as Minx): Yes, though we appreciate the sentiment.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. How much is the toll?
Rhi: It’s not insignificant, but it also doesn’t reach the level of being measured in 1 coin.
Minna (as Myra): Say if I add a little bit on, are you willing to pass on some information? You seem to have quite sharp eyes.
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Minna: That’s a Consort, right?
Rhi: Yeah. You are making an honest deal, you’re just offering to pay them for information.
Minna: Six.
Kim: Woo.
Rhi: Good lord.
Minna: I roll three dice for Consort, so it’s a good chance.
Rhi: Yeah. So the two of them glance at each other.
Rhi (as Crow): Make it a coin proper and yeah, we can tell you something.
Minna (as Myra): Gladly.
Minna: She feels the pinch, but she fishes out the coin because this is useful.
Rhi: Yeah. They take your money looking very pleased with themselves.
Minna (as Myra): Were you here on this bridge about two or three days ago?
Rhi: One of them nods.
Rhi (as Crow): Yeah, Lyssa’s got us out here making sure people stay safe.
Rhi: They give you a crooked grin.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure you do an excellent job.
Rhi (as Crow): Oh, we do great.
Minna (as Myra): How many carriages do you get along this bridge?
Rhi (as Crow): Hmm, not many, mostly foot traffic.
Minna (as Myra): Two or three days ago, did you get a carriage?
Rhi (as Crow): Hmm… Yeah, yeah!
Rhi: The person you’re talking to does that thing where they smack the other person’s arm, and he’s like “ow, you don’t need to hit me to remember.”
[laughter]
Kim: “We talked about this!”
Rhi (as Crow): Yeah, yeah, it was a carriage… and we were talking to the driver and it sounded like there was some kind of scuffle inside. The door was open and a couple people kind of piled out. They hauled some old guy back in and then the driver just threw a bunch of coin at us and they went on. Where were they…?
Rhi: They turn around and squint down the street.
Rhi (as Crow): I think they turned on Cinder Street down that a’ways.
Minna: So, where does Cinder Street go towards, out of character?
Rhi: Psh. I don’t know. I just picked a street. [laughs]
Minna: Well, which way are they going basically?
Rhi: It’s a north-south street. If they took Cinder Street straight—I’m looking at the map of Crow’s Foot. You come across the bridge and then it’s a major street that if they stayed on it going north, which is the direction that this person said they were going, they would end up in The Docks, but there’s also places obviously where they could have turned off.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you for that information. Can you think of anything else, guys, that we need to know about these folks?
Josie (as Minx): Not especially. It seems like the trail won’t be that hard to follow.
Minna (as Myra): I’d appreciate it if you kept it quiet that we were asking these questions by the way.
Rhi: They just wink at you.
Rhi (as Crow): Of course.
Rhi: They pat the coin purse that they’ve got at their hip.
Rhi (as Crow): Yeah, don’t worry about it.
Josie: All right. I think we head towards The Docks next, maybe?
Minna: Yeah, along Cinder Street.
Rhi: So, generally I’m not supposed to call for specific rolls as the GM, but whatever, I’m doing it anyway. Can I get, since this is Gather Info you all can decide whether you want to do it as a group or not, but some kind of perception, noticing things, looking around type roll from whoever would like to do that as you’re making your way up this street?
Minna: I could do a Study if you want.
Josie: Yeah, I mean, I have Survey.
Kim: Yeah. I’ll roll Survey.
Minna: I think I’m just gonna roll Study on my own.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Damn it. [laughs]
Josie: I didn’t get there. I got a 2.
Kim: That’s a 6 from me.
Josie: Nice!
Minna: Study is a failure. I got a 2.
Rhi: A 2 and a 2…
Kim: I see all!
Rhi: I think Minx and Myra are kind of leading the way and hurrying towards The Docks. Blaire, you are hurrying along with them, but you’ve fallen a few steps behind and you’re just sort of glancing around as you go, looking for anything suspicious. You glance down into an alley and you see the back corner of a carriage parked.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] Guys! Guys! Wait up!
Josie & Minna (as Minx & Myra): Hmm?
Kim (as Blaire): Look!
Kim: She’s gonna point down the alley where the carriage is.
Minna (as Myra): Oh! Good eye.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Josie: Where has the carriage stopped?
Rhi: If you head down, it’s just this little side alley between a few buildings. It basically looks like it was parked in a vacant lot behind a warehouse. It’s not very neatly parked. It looks like it was stopped in a hurry and just left. The door is kind of cracked open.
Josie: I see. I want to try and sneak in the door.
Rhi: Looking inside… Yeah, I think you are gonna need to give me some kind of roll for investigating the thing, or sneaking, however you want to approach it. I just need some sort of roll so I know how much info to give you.
Josie: Okay. I’m rolling Prowl, but this is still a Gather Information?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: So, 6.
Rhi: You ease the door open enough that the streetlights can illuminate the inside. It does look like there was some kind of fight inside the carriage. Some of the fabric on the seats is torn. There’s a small, not worryingly large, but what looks to be a bloodstain on one of the walls. Not huge, but there is some blood. You catch as you’re looking around there’s a glint, and you see underneath a seat a brass button that looks like it got torn off. There’s still a few black threads stuck to it.
Josie: Mm-hmm. I’m gonna take it.
Kim: Can I roll Attune again to try and get a flashback of what happened here?
Rhi: Yeah!
Kim: Okay, that’s a 5.
Rhi: Again, it’s that same kind of unclear figures moving through the scene. You can’t really see any physical objects that they’re interacting with. What you see is two figures jump down off the top of the carriage and pull the door open, and then another two half fall out hauling the figure that you’re guessing is Harker between them. there seems to still be kind of a struggle. One of them moves like they’re putting something on Harker’s head, maybe a bag or something. It’s a little unnerving for a second, Blaire, because they basically move towards you and you step out of the way and turn to watch them as they go behind you to the stairs leading down into the catacombs.
Minna: Hmm~
Kim (as Blaire): He was here, and I know where they went this time.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): They went down into the catacombs.
Josie (as Minx): Well, if it’s been a few days already, I think we might be able to take the time to load up before we head into the dark.
Kim (as Blaire): Not a bad idea.
## Score [0:36:35]
Rhi: All right. Let’s get into this score. What are we thinking for the type of plan?
Josie: I think Assault. We gotta be ready for a fight on this one.
Minna: [groans]
Rhi: Okay. That sounds… Yeah, that sounds about right.
Minna: Uh-huh…
Rhi: Engagement roll… All right. Because of some other questions that I had to answer here, you are 2d6 and taking the lower.
Josie: Oof. That’s not good.
Kim: Oh… Oh no.
Rhi: All right… That is a 2.
Players: [nervous noises]
Rhi: So, we see that same alley, The Magpies now clearly carrying a lot more gear descend those steps down into the catacombs. Blaire, you know the catacombs fairly well, you spent a lot of time in here. You figure out fairly quickly where you need to go, because there’s not really, like… Only other people who are moving through the catacombs or using the catacombs bring in light, there’s not just standard light sources down here, so when you see, as you’re heading down, lamplight up a little ways you start heading in that direction. You’re so focused on getting to this light that you do not notice the pair of guards who step out from little niches on either side, and they grab at Minx and Myra.
Kim (as Blaire): Agh!
Josie: All right, moving right to this then.
Minna (as Myra): Ah!
Kim (as Blaire): Let go of my moms!
[burst of laughter]
Josie: Kim…
Kim: Yes?
Josie: Why are you killing me live on air?
Kim: [giggles] I’m just trying to think of a bluff.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re trying to find my dog! Let my moms go…
Rhi: [fighting laughter] Roll for it?
Minna: [weakly] We’re like a few years older than you.
Rhi: [smiling] This is desperate and reduced effect?!
Kim: [laughing] I’m gonna break.
Josie: We are clearly carrying weapons, I would like to remind you!
Rhi: Yeah, actually no, I’m sorry, this is zero effect. This is a terrible lie, but you’re welcome to try it.
Kim: I did not think this through. I went with my first bluff that came to my mind.
Rhi: It’s very good.
Josie: But now you’ve said “let go of my moms” and you can’t take that back.
[giggling]
Rhi: You can push yourself to get up to reduced effect.
Kim: What is zero effect?
Rhi: It means it’s not gonna work.
Kim: Oh. Oh… Yes, I will push myself.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, so take your stress. That gets you to desperate position, reduced effect. Myra is helping you so you have two dice.
Kim: Ohh… My dudes, that’s a 6.
Minna: Woo!
Josie: What?! [laughs]
Rhi: Okay, but it is reduced effect even with a 6, so…
Kim: What does that look like?
Rhi: Man, let me think. They stare at the three of you, and I think it’s a thing where they’re pretty sure that you’re lying…
Kim: My puppy dog eyes are so good tonight.
Josie: It’s so absurd that there must be something to it?
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. They look at each other and then they seem to look over Minx and Myra again and are noting just the way that you look.
Kim (as Blaire): I was adopted, you dorks! Geez.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi (as Guard1): We’re—[sighs] This isn’t worth it.
Rhi (as Guard2): Yeah, it’s not.
Rhi (as Guard1): Just don’t cause any trouble. We haven’t seen a dog.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks. We’ll keep looking for him.
Josie (as Minx): Phew. You did give us quite a fright though. Come along, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): Can we get out of here soon, mama? It’s really cold in here.
Rhi: [splutters into laughter]
Josie (as Minx): You were the one who insisted.
Rhi: You hear one of them behind you mutter.
Rhi (as Guard): Overselling it, kid.
[laughter]
Josie: Wait, if they know we’re lying why are they letting us by?
Kim: Because I rolled a 6! That’s the only reason.
Rhi: Eh, as far as you know. Anyway.
Josie: [laughing] That fucking worked!
Kim: [laughing] Why am I allowed to play anything?
Rhi & Josie: Because you’re great.
Rhi: You continue down this passage and you eventually get to an intersection and you see if you turn left you’ll be heading towards light again. You make your way down this hall towards the light, and you find yourselves facing a large, open room which Blaire, again, you know that these are kind of common in the catacombs. There’s just big, central rooms that have lots of hallways branching off of them.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: This one looks like at some point somebody was using it for storage, maybe they still are, but there’s some kind of crates and boxes down here, a lot of them have cobwebs and dust on them. There’s several other hallways branching out from this, and there is a balcony ringing up around at the top where a second floor would be. In the middle of the room, tied to a chair, head lolling forward on his chest is Harker.
Kim (as Blaire): This… seems like it could be a trap.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed, a blatantly obvious one.
Kim (as Blaire): But we gotta get him out of there.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I could serve as bait to get it started while you two hang back and cover me.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m not comfortable with that.
Minna (as Myra): We don’t know who we’re facing here.
Minna: Is there some way to sneak around the edges of the room, like behind and around crates, or are they packed too tightly?
Rhi: You’re welcome to try.
Josie: Actually, can I do a flashback as part of my gearing up to have gotten some smoke bombs from Seeks?
Rhi: You can have one. That’s gonna be a 1 stress flashback.
Josie: Okay, I will do that.
Kim: That’s not a bad idea to use that for cover.
Josie: Yeah. We can cover possibly the left half with smoke to reduce the avenues they can come at us.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a fairly big room, so the most you’re gonna be able to get is part of it. Part of it is gonna be exposed.
Josie: Mm-hmm. There’s also, we are in the catacombs, surely there is no shortage of friends about who might be able to stir something up.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] Ooh…
Josie: Ghost riot, #GhostRiot.
Kim: No, not again, because that created a Harvester. I’m gonna roll Attune actually to see if there are any ghosty friends around.
Rhi: All right. It’s desperate.
Kim: Heh, that’s double 3s, baby.
Rhi: All right. You look into the ghost field, and not only is this area seemingly just unsettlingly devoid of ghosts, as you’re looking you see ringed around the edges of this central room a bunch of wards and spirit bane charms. Basically this room has been built to block ghosts. Now that’s what you see.
Kim: Shit.
Rhi: The consequence is that a shot rings out, Harker screams and topples back over in the chair.
Kim: [gasps] Oh my God! [covers mouth]
Josie: Oh no!
Kim: Oh my God.
Minna: [breathes]
Kim: Oh my God…
Josie: All right…
Rhi: You didn’t really see. It seemed to hit in the upper chest area. You’re not sure if it was a shoulder or a chest or what.
Kim: Oh no.
Josie: Okay, so someone else was looking into the ghost field. I’m moving now.
Kim: Or they knew I was coming. Oh God. We need to get him. Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
Josie: Yeah. Minx is gonna try her best on the spot to try and figure out where the shot came from and throw the smoke bomb in that direction.
Rhi: All right. Roll me something. It’s still desperate. Y’all are gonna get a lot of xp out of this session, I’m gonna tell you that right now.
Kim: [laughs nervously]
Josie: Can a case be made for Skirmish in this situation?
Rhi: You’re analyzing a combat situation, yeah, I’ll allow it.
Josie: Okay, and am I at reduced effect currently?
Rhi: No, standard effect, just desperate position.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. As you run out you spin around and you can see up in the balcony there’s a guy with a rifle quickly reloading, and you are able to basically throw the smoke bomb in a way that is gonna block that area of the balcony’s view.
Josie: Yup, and I’m bolting for Harker.
Rhi: Basically the hit knocked the chair over. He is awake and alive. It looks like it hit his shoulder. He’s bleeding a lot. He’s struggling against his bonds as best he can. He looks up at you frantically as you rush over.
Rhi (as Harker): [angrily] What took you so long?!
Josie (as Minx): A thank you would be nice, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): [sobbing] I’m sorry! I’m sorry. I didn’t know that looking into the ghost field—
Rhi: Blaire, are you running out?
Kim: Oh, that’s right, I’m 20 feet away. I guess I should.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Haha, I’m gonna die.
Rhi: The two of you get out there and I assume you’re working to untie Harker.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Uh, I’m actually thinking it might be better to just haul him by the chair out and then we can cut him when we’re not getting shot at.
Rhi: If you’re hauling him out by the chair you’re gonna have to make a roll.
Josie: Are you saying we won’t need to make a roll if we cut him out? Will we be able to do it quick enough?
Rhi: Cutting him out is gonna take more time.
Josie: Yeah. I think I’m gonna roll to haul him out by the chair so we can cut him out when we’re not being shot at.
Kim: Would you like an assist?
Josie: Yes, please. I’m not sure what kind of roll to make here.
Rhi: Probably Prowl, this is a physical thing you’re trying to do.
Josie: Okay. I got a 6.
Kim: Phew.
Rhi: Okay. You start hauling him back across the… [breathes] Yeah. I’m just thinking about it, and hauling a person in a chair, I think this is gonna have to have been at reduced effect, so you make it about half way.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Because he’s also struggling and in pain and not helping. I’m gonna need another roll for you to get clear.
Josie: I think it’s gonna be Prowl again.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Still desperate, still reduced effect.
Josie: Yes. I would like to push myself to increase effect. Blaire, are you free to assist me again?
Kim: Sure… just don’t fuck it up.
Josie: I will attempt to not fuck it up. I got a 5.
Rhi: All right. So, you are dragging Harker, you’re going as fast as you can, and I think you kind of shove him and Blaire forward into the smoke, so you are exposed when the rest of the shooters come out on the balcony and the tunnels behind you and open fire.
Josie: [cringing] That’s a really good moment.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim (as Blaire): Minx!
Josie: Ouch.
Rhi: You are going to take level 4 harm.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim: WHAT?!
Rhi: Bullets rip through you.
Josie: Here’s the thing, hold on, I have armor.
Rhi: Yeah, you can use armor.
Josie: What does armor actually do?
Rhi: Armor will reduce it down to level 3 harm, so you’re not dead.
Kim: Jesus Christ!
Josie: … Okay. Since I can declare on the spot, I’m gonna declare heavy armor.
Rhi: Now that is burning 5 of your slots, just so you know.
Josie: Burning 5 of my slots?
Rhi: Yes. Heavy armor—So, armor is 2, heavy armor is another 3 on top of that.
Josie: Oh! It’s another 3 on top. Oof.
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: Yeah. Heavy armor is an investment.
Josie: All right, yeah, that would fill out… Yeah, I think light armor makes sense, so it’s level 3 harm.
Rhi: That will reduce it to level 3 harm, which means Minx can’t do anything without help.
Kim: [into hands] Oh my God… Oh my God…
Josie: Can I roll to resist this?
Rhi: Yes, I will let you stack that. You can resist it and use your armor. That will drop it to level 2. You resist this with Prowess.
Josie: Yes, which I have my max Resistance for, which is nice.
Kim: Don’t die, Minx.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Five, so you will take 1 point of stress and this is reduced. You’ve knocked it down with armor and resisting stress, it’s down to level 2 harm.
Josie: Phew! Fuckin’…
Rhi: You’re still at a -1 on anything physical.
Josie: Right. What should I call this, just like Shot to Shit?
Rhi: Yeah, you got shot in the back multiple times. Your armor soaked a lot of it, you managed to dodge out of the way of some of it, but your life just flashed before your eyes.
Josie: Ow! Yes… I also only have 2 stress left before a trauma.
Kim: [musically] Blaire is screaming.
Rhi: Myra?
Minna: Can I see who’s doing the shooting? There’s HOW many people?
Rhi: Peering through the smoke you are able to see, up on the balcony, there’s probably about half a dozen people, and then it looks like coming in the other tunnels, there’s three other tunnels on the side opposite you, you see there’s three groups of four.
Josie: Ahh~!
Minna: Ahh…
Rhi: So, we’re looking at 18 people that you can see.
Josie: [gasps] Okay!
Minna: Okay. It’s time to get the fuck out of here.
Kim: Jesus.
Rhi: You can hear that they’re running towards your position, so you all need to move fast.
Minna: Yeah. Myra at this point is probably going to be helping with getting Harker out.
Rhi: I’m gonna need some kind of roll for cutting Harker loose just to determine how close they get to you.
Kim: Can I make an argument for Finesse?
Rhi: Yeah, Finesse would be a good one here.
Minna: Are you doing it or do you want me?
Kim: No, I did it. I rolled a 3. Was it still desperate?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Okay, xp for me…
Rhi: So, you pull out a little pocket knife that everybody carries and you go to start cutting at the ropes, and you hear footsteps coming up the hall that you all came in. Remember those two that just let you walk on past?
Minna: Uh-huh…
Josie: Yep…
Rhi: Yeah. Them and two of their friends are coming up and they are going to shoot at Blaire.
Kim: [seethes] No! No! No!
Rhi: Blaire, you’re gonna take level 3 harm. You’ve got just enough cover from smoke that it’s not level 4, but you’re taking level 3 harm as they open fire on you.
Kim: What do I roll to resist?!
Rhi: Prowess.
Kim: Okay, that’s three dice for me… Ooh… That’s a 4.
Rhi: You take 2 stress, and that’s gonna drop it down to level 2 harm.
Kim: Shot.
Rhi: Yeah. You are now basically being pincered. You’ve got four people coming up the hallway that you came in and you’ve got God only knows how many coming in from the main room.
Kim: Guys, are we gonna die?!
Minna: [nervous noises] Maybe…
Kim: Are we gonna die?!
Josie: GMs don’t do this unless there’s some sort of plan. [laughs]
Kim: [sobbing] Are we gonna die?
Rhi: … Myra, what are you gonna do here?
Minna: Oh my God. Where the hell can I… [breathes] I want to send my friends ahead of me, but there’s nowhere to send them.
Rhi: So, I will say, for the shooting—Let me double-check this real quick. I think the pistols of this world are single shot, breech, loading. They’re slow to reload. So, unless these guys are packing multiple pistols, which they might be, you’re gonna have a little time while they are reloading.
Minna: I’m gonna try and get Harker loose. What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Josie: I’m afraid of any Devil’s Bargain in this scenario.
Minna: Actually, can I argue Study? Like, she examines to see which knot would undo it and what the best way to do it is versus just trying to cut everything.
Rhi: Yes, I’ll allow Study. You made a good argument for it.
Minna: I still rolled a fucking 3. Was that desperate?
Rhi: For this one, no, because they’re reloading. Risky, so it’s still not great.
Minna: No, it’s not.
Rhi: From the main room there’s a few stray shots into the smoke and one of those bullets hits you, so you’re gonna take level 2 harm.
Minna: I’m gonna resist that shit.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: It’s Prowess, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: That’s a 4, so I’m gonna take 2 stress. Ugh, I’m 3 away from trauma.
Kim: I am 1.
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: Harker is still tied to this chair…
Minna: Oh my God!
Rhi: …and is getting to the point where he’s just drifting in and out of consciousness.
Kim: Gahhh.
Josie: Okay. I have a pistol as well as a second pistol, and I just want to shoot at the guys that are in our way.
Rhi: Okay. It is gonna be risky.
Josie: I got a 4.
Rhi: So, you just bring them both up, fire, and you hit two of them. They aren’t dead, but they’re injured and they are dealing with the fact that they just got shot. Two of them have been shot and at least for the moment have been removed from the combat. The two behind them have finished reloading, so we’re gonna be back in a desperate situation, and those people coming across the room are getting really close.
Minna: Can we just all three of us start shoving the chair with Harker through the hallway?
Rhi: Yeah, you can start trying to drag him.
Josie: [laughing] Yeah, okay, I guess the chair is coming too.
Minna: [smiling] We have failed three or four times to untie him.
Josie: Yeah, with a knife, we have failed to untie him.
Minna: And with trying to untie.
Rhi: Okay, so there’s gonna need to be some sort of roll to deal with the fact that you are dragging an injured man in a chair past two people with guns.
Josie: Yup, and I’m at -1 die for that.
Rhi: Yes, so is Blaire.
Minna: And so am I, right? I got shot.
Rhi: Myra, you are at reduced effect, because you got that down to a level 1 harm. Yeah, there’s gonna need to be some kind of roll from somebody.
Josie: Uh, Myra, how’s your stress doing?
Minna: only have 3 to spare.
Josie: But you could technically lead a group action about it.
Rhi: So long as one person made it.
Josie: Right. Ugh.
Kim: I believe in the three of us.
Minna: What are we trying to do, a group Prowl?
Rhi: Yeah, group Prowl would be good.
Kim: I got a 5.
Minna: [sigh of relief] I got a 5 also.
Josie: A 4.
Rhi: Okay, so no stress.
Josie: We all succeeded!
Kim: Phew.
Minna: [exhales]
Josie: Hurray.
Minna: With a 5.
Rhi: Yeah. All right, let me grab a d4… to figure out who gets shot…
Kim: No…
Josie: Oh God.
Rhi: … Myra.
Minna: Mm-hmm?
Rhi: I think since you were leading the group action you’re leading the group, and you are out in front when these two get their pistols up and fire, so you are taking level 3 harm.
Kim: [groans] Come on.
Minna: I’m using my armor here.
Rhi: Okay, that’ll get it down to level 2, but you still do it. They fire—
Minna: Where have I been shot, the original graze and this one? I know this is super meta, but…
Rhi: They’re going mostly for torso shots. They are shooting for center of mass. They’re shooting to kill.
Minna: So I think the graze is gonna be my side and…
Rhi: I think what happens, the bullets basically hit your chest and the armor keeps it from being a really bad wound, but you’ve got some broken ribs from the impact and things like that.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Even with that, you take that consequence, but you are all able to barrel past these two and start getting down the hallway.
Kim: Okay.
Josie: Okay. Minx, in a voice that isn’t commonly heard, says:
Josie (as Minx): Will someone give me some fucking explosives?
Minna: Oh. I can do that…?
Rhi: As long as somebody has 2 slots of load available, demolition tools take two.
Minna: I do.
Rhi: So yeah.
Minna: I pull out… I’m just picturing TNT, I know that’s not right. [laughs]
Rhi: I mean, dynamite.
Josie: Yeah, I mean, why not?
Kim: Yeah, sure.
Minna: Yeah, pull out some dynamite.
Josie (as Minx): All right. You two keep going. I’ll catch up.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you sure?!
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I’ll find you. Just fucking go.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, promise!
Josie (as Minx): I promise.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Rhi: I assume Blaire and Myra are gonna continue to drag Harker and chair. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: I want to, now that we are past all the people—
Rhi: Yeah, you’ve basically forced them into a bottleneck.
Josie: Yes, I want to collapse the bottleneck.
Rhi: Good. Good call.
Josie: Which I believe will be a Wreck.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Huh… Okay, I was gonna push myself on the Wreck action, but I actually think my 2 stress action is gonna be to use Rook’s Gambit to roll Sway instead? [laughs] And just, in general, make a come at me gesture to try and get them all in there.
Kim: Oh, that’s so badass.
Rhi: Yeah. Yep, yep, good call.
Josie: Thing is, that makes me take trauma.
Rhi: Yes it does.
Kim: Oh geez.
Josie: I did get a 6.
Rhi: Paint me a picture. Tell me how this goes down.
Josie: Minx yells in her not-normal voice to get the explosive, she has it, she kind of tears the pin out of her hair to let her hair down, has got dynamite in one hand and pulls out her sword cane in her other and is making like she’s about to make a last stand so the people will come at her, but with that, in that pose will light the dynamite behind her back and then toss it ahead of her.
Kim: Oh, fuck yeah.
Josie: And then I think we only hear the explosion, we don’t see it.
Rhi: Yes. I think what happens is, we see behind her back as Minx lights it and she hurls it down the hallway towards the onrushing, what you can now see in the light from the lanterns that they are wearing the garb of The Umbra Hunters, at least the ones out in the lead, come charging towards you. On Minx’s end we see the flash and then we cut up to Blaire, Myra and Harker. I think by this point the two of you have managed to get Harker untied and are carrying him up the stairs.
Kim: Thank you.
Rhi: You hear the (BOOM).
Kim (as Blaire): [sobbing] Oh my gods. Oh my gods…
Minna (as Myra): We need to just get out of here.
Kim (as Blaire): But—
Minna (as Myra): She chose this. We’re gonna honor that by getting her friend to somebody who can see to his wound.
Rhi (as Harker): [weakly] She’ll be fine… Ellie’s a smart girl even if you all take too fucking long. What was the damn hold up? I sent you that note a week ago.
Minna (as Myra): It got to us today.
Rhi (as Harker): Maybe I ought to have a talk with your friend then.
Minna (as Myra): Oh no…
Kim (as Blaire): Wh—Rigney?
Rhi (as Harker): The bartender, tall, dark and handsome. I left the note there. I know that’s your hangout. Left the note there a week ago. [grunts in pain]
Kim (as Blaire): He was—He was out.
Rhi: He was out today. He was there a week ago.
Kim: [gasps]
Minna: No! Rhi, you cannot do this to us!
Kim: What?!
Josie: No~!
Minna: I refuse. Can I resist this? [laughs]
Kim: What?!
Rhi: Nope.
Kim: WHAT?!
Josie: Oh no.
Minna: Okay. I think we’re just gonna have our minds blown and try and hustle this man to medic—
Kim: [into hands] Oh my God!
Josie: [frantic] Did Rigney sell us out?
Kim: No, I trusted him!
Rhi: [calmly] You’ll just have to have a chat.
Kim: I loved him!
Minna: There could be another explanation. There could be another explanation.
Kim: Rhi!
Rhi: … Seeks is in Charhollow, so you could get Harker to Seeks very easily.
Minna: Okay. We’re gonna do that. Now that we’re out of a pressure situation, can we untie Harker?
Rhi: Oh yeah, yeah, I had said that you’d gotten him untied at some point in your hustling through the hallways. Yeah. You two take Harker to Seeks. Seeks is extremely worried.
Minna: I feel like at this point Myra also gets a little bit of healing if Seeks has time.
Rhi: Yeah. We can count that if you do healing for your downtime action. Myra and Blaire, Seeks forces you. The two of you are like “uh, we gotta go,” and Seeks is like
Waffles (as Seeks): You two, no. No, nuh-uh. Do not think I did not notice your wounds. You two sit down on the table.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but Minx!
Waffles (as Seeks): Mm! In 15 minutes you will have fresh stitches that you can feel free to tear as you go head first into danger, but you are not leaving here bleeding all over the cobblestones. I have a reputation to keep.
Rhi: So Seeks forcibly patches you up. I kind of like this, that by the time Blaire and Myra are released from Seeks’s care, I think Harker she’s keeping there to keep an eye on him. It’s kind of like, in modern terms it would be critical but stable.
Minna: Mm-hmm. For observation?
Rhi: He lost a lot of blood, and he’s older, so he can’t really take being shot as easily as you young whippersnappers can, but it seems like he’s gonna be okay. He just needs to, you know, have medical attention and treatment for a while. I think what it is, I like Myra and Blaire coming back to The Nest and Minx is just sitting in the common room, or pacing in the common room. Probably pacing, because Minx doesn’t know that the two of you are okay. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Minx!
Kim: Blaire’s gonna run up and hug her.
Josie (as Minx): Hey dear.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, thank goodness.
Josie (as Minx): Easy, easy though, back still hurts, a lot.
Kim (as Blaire): [sobbing] Don’t ever do that again.
Minna (as Myra): There’s too few of us for us to be losing each other in desperate actions.
Josie (as Minx): Hey, I was gonna be okay.
Kim (as Blaire): But what if you weren’t?! Sorry… [tearful] Don’t do that again, please.
Josie: I think Minx is just gonna run her hands through Blaire’s hair because she’s crying and I can’t deal with Blaire crying.
Rhi: Aww~
Josie: I can’t deal with that, y’all. [emotional chuckles]
Kim: Aw, I’m sorry. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Sorry y’all, I’ll try to think ahead next time.
Kim (as Blaire): You really scared me.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] You deal with ghosts all day and I scared you?
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): I think she doesn’t want you to be a ghost.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I’m not keen on the idea either, but hey, for friends it’s not a bad way to go. He’s a good guy, but I never thought I’d be pulling that shit for fucking Harker. [laughs] He is all right, right?
Minna (as Myra): We left him with Seeks. He’s stable.
Kim (as Blaire): He’ll be okay, probably.
Josie (as Minx): Okay.
Josie: She’s gonna sit down heavily.
Josie (as Minx): I was not expecting that many people. [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): [laughs reluctantly] I wanna know who hates us this much.
Kim (as Blaire): I just don’t know what would’ve happened—I started this. All I did was look into the ghost field, and… it just—
Josie (as Minx): Hey—
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, no! They were waiting for us. They put him out there like a bait.
Kim (as Blaire): I know that, but—
Josie (as Minx): As soon as any of us did anything it would have happened. It’s not your fault, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): But, me looking into the ghost field usually just doesn’t do anything in the real world.
Minna: I think Myra goes to Blaire and takes her hands.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know…
Josie: Aw.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know who did that, or how. Clearly we’re facing something we’re not used to, which [chuckles] whatever it is it’s not your fault, it’s just that somebody was waiting for you and knew what was going to happen before we did. Sometimes you’re just not the fastest in the room or not the smartest in the room, and that’s not your fault.
Kim (as Blaire): They had spirit and demon bane charms all over the room. They took the one thing I was good at and just… beat me to it.
Josie (as Minx): They were prepared for all of us, which is why I kind of had to get explody about it.
Minna (as Myra): Take it as a compliment.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Minx, we need to talk to Rigney.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, he’s been out for a while, huh?
Minna (as Myra): No, he’s been out for a day, but Harker sent that note a week ago.
Kim (as Blaire): He was hiding the note from us.
Minna (as Myra): We don’t know why, though. I don’t want to believe that he did it because he wanted to.
Josie: Minx is kind of flexing her hands, like she’s just trying to keep contained.
Minna (as Myra): These are dangerous people. Anybody who’s connected to us could be in danger. It could be he just got spooked. I mean, look at what happened to Harker, that could be Rigney next. Maybe that’s what they threatened.
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t—Don’t say that.
Minna (as Myra): I know, I’m just saying, it might be safer if we let him…
Kim (as Blaire): (tearfully) I just think I still trust him.
Josie (as Minx): I can’t. Yeah, we need to figure that out right now. I’m going if you guys aren’t.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Okay, we’re coming then.
Minna: I like that you’re clearly already playing your trauma. [laughs] You get some xp.
Josie (as Minx): [smiling] Yup. I would like to state for the viewers at home that I chose Reckless.
Rhi: Excellent. The three of you leave The Nest, make your way down into Nightmarket. By this time it’s late enough at night to be early. You get to The Hound’s Paw and it should be closed by now, but the lights are all still on. The door is open, and you go inside, and it’s completely empty except for Rigney, who is sitting at a table with a half empty bottle of bottom shelf rum beside him.
Minna: Oh no.
Josie: Minx is gonna walk right up to him, take off a glove, and slap him with it.
Minna (as Myra): [gasps]
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] Minx!
Rhi: He just takes it. He brings his head back around, looks up at Minx, and just can’t keep his eyes on you for more than a second, like it is obvious that he is just racked with guilt.
Rhi (as Rigney): You know…
Minna: Myra definitely sits next to him.
Minna (as Myra): What did they threaten?
Rhi (as Rigney): I have a brother, Nevan, he’s four years younger than me. He was a thief like you all were. I kept telling him give it up, find something safer, but he never listened. Little brothers never listen. A couple years ago he got convicted of arson. He didn’t do it, that wasn’t the way he worked, but some Bluecoats burned down the wrong place and needed to pin it on somebody so they framed him, and he got sent out to The Deathlands. I pay a smuggler to take him letters and packages, bring letters back. It was the best I could do.
Rhi: He pauses and takes a big swig straight from the bottle.
Kim (as Blaire): Rigney, why didn’t you tell us that? I could have gotten him out.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, case and point, we’re ready to fucking explode for you.
Rhi (as Rigney): A few months ago, after the riots, after they took Phin, the smuggler that I hired didn’t show up when she was supposed to. Nothing, for a week and a half ,I thought he was dead, and then this woman showed up with Nevan’s letter.
Josie: Minx is gonna slam a hand down on the table.
Josie (as Minx): Months?!
Rhi (as Rigney): She said that if I didn’t want anything to happen to my brother I had to start telling her everything I could, about you, about what you were doing. Any time you made plans I had to pass it along.
Josie (as Minx): For months?
Rhi: [smiling] Yeah. You all know how every time you’ve made plans in The Hound’s Paw I’ve reduced a die from the engagement roll?
Minna: Ohh, was that what that was?
Josie: Oh fuck.
Rhi: Yup.
Minna: Okay. I think Myra breaks in.
Minna (as Myra): What did she look like?
Rhi: I don’t know, Minna… What does Salia look like?
Minna: So, I think… I feel like she looks like a grown up Myra, almost. I don’t know why that’s how I’m picturing her. She has some gray in her hair. She’s very…
Rhi: Severe?
Minna: …sternly—Severe! Very severe.
Rhi: He starts describing her and trails off midway through.
Rhi (as Rigney): It’s Salia.
Minna (as Myra): Did she tell you why?
Rhi: He shakes his head.
Minna (as Myra): Did she tell you it was about the Circle or is it just her?
Rhi (as Rigney): I wasn’t really in a position to ask questions.
Minna (as Myra): No, I understand, and I know how she can be. I know that she would have sounded like she meant every word, and I’m sorry that you got mixed up in this. You shouldn’t have been in that kind of danger and I can’t believe that you let us put you in that danger.
Rhi (as Rigney): If anything, you should not be apologizing, Myra. I…
Minna (as Myra): No. Rigney, listen to me. This is our fault. We brought this. You made the best choice that you could and it was a terrible choice—
Rhi (as Rigney): No, I didn’t! I’m not… I’m not like you! I didn’t tell you because I’m not brave! You all go out in the city and you risk your necks trying to help people… and I sit here and I pour you drinks and I pass along letters and I tell myself that it’s enough. I didn’t tell you because I’m a fucking coward, and I was scared that if I did she’d find out and have my brother killed. So I’m sorry! I’m sorry.
Minna (as Myra): Rigney…
Kim (as Blaire): Rigney, if she was doing that to any one of us, if she was blackmailing any of us to hurt any of our families, anyone in our crew, we would have done the same thing, okay?
Josie (as Minx): I wouldn’t have.
Kim (as Blaire): Because we look after each other, and you…
Rhi (as Rigney): You would have said something, because that’s what you do.
Kim (as Blaire): No…
Rhi (as Rigney): You stand up to people. You stand up for people. I’m—
Minna (as Myra): You do too.
Rhi (as Rigney): I like all of you, I do, you’re my friends, but I always said that I’d do anything for my little brother and it turns out I meant it. Is your friend okay?
Josie (as Minx): He’s fine.
Minna (as Myra): Harker’s okay.
Josie (as Minx): Are you okay now that you’re telling us?
Rhi (as Rigney): [laughing] Fuck no.
Rhi: And he takes another swig.
Minna: Myra takes his hand and just holds it tightly between both of hers.
Minna (as Myra): What would help move this forward? Is your brother safe? Do you have proof?
Rhi (as Rigney): I got a letter from Nevan a week ago, so as of that point he was fine, or as fine as you can be out in The Deathlands.
Minna (as Myra): But they still have some kind of control?
Rhi (as Rigney): She knows enough of where he is to intercept his letters to me and write her own comments in the margins. She knows enough to intercept the packages that I was sending him. I tried to lie and she found out.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] She would.
Rhi (as Rigney): For two months she intercepted the packages that I send out. It’s food, and warm clothes, and humor tonics, the things he needs to make him feel like a person, and she kept them from him, to punish me. I am sorry.
Josie (as Minx): So we’re killing Salia, right?
Kim (as Blaire): And we’re getting Nevan out of The Deathlands.
Minna: I think Myra’s just staring at Minx.
Minna (as Myra): Kill Salia?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. I mean, I thought Bazso was bad, that my bullshit was bad, but she’s hurting people we care about. Fuck her.
Kim (as Blaire): She can’t be doing this to our family.
Minna (as Myra): I agree, but I don’t think it’s gonna be as easy as that, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): I didn’t say it would be easy, but it is that simple.
Minna (as Myra): Is it?
Kim (as Blaire): [frantic] We have a fucking demon on our side! How hard can it be?
Minna (as Myra): If we kill Salia, and we’ve killed Avrathi, and we put Brogan away, what happens when the next one rises up? We can’t kill the whole city to fix it.
Kim (as Blaire): Salia isn’t the whole city.
Josie (as Minx): I can kill anyone who’s threatening people we love, the whole reason I still fucking bother is to take care of people.
Minna (as Myra): I think we start with Nevan.
Kim (as Blaire): If we get him out of The Deathlands, Salia won’t—and hide him, that’s the important thing, if we get him out of The Deathlands and hide—
Rhi (as Rigney): He can’t, he can’t stay in the city.
Minna (as Myra): I know.
Rhi (as Rigney): It’s not just Salia, it’s The Bluecoats, it’s…
Josie (as Minx): Well, we might be able to send him off somewhere else by train or something.
Rhi: he just nods.
Kim (as Blaire): We could send him to Tycheros. My family would probably be happy to look after him.
Rhi (as Rigney): If you can get him out of The Deathlands maybe we can see where he wants to go.
Kim (as Blaire): We can do that. You know I’ve been there and back thousands of times.
Minna (as Myra): Rigney, I’m so sorry.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re gonna fix this.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, I’m sorry, too.
Minna (as Myra): I forgive you.
Josie (as Minx): I don’t. I’m doing this for Nevan, not you.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx…
Rhi: Rigney oddly enough looks more comfortable with Minx’s response than Myra’s.
Josie (as Minx): Are we done?
Kim: Uh, no. I’m gonna hug Rigney, because I’m… I don’t know. Blaire forgives easy I guess.
Rhi: Yeah. Rigney does not respond to the hug. He doesn’t push you away, but he doesn’t hug you back either. He’s just kind of sitting there.
Minna (as Myra): I think it’s best if we don’t come by for a little bit.
Rhi: He nods.
Minna (as Myra): Safer for everyone?
Kim (as Blaire): We’re gonna make this right. We’re gonna make sure that everyone is safe after.
Rhi: He’s just nodding in response to what you’re all saying but isn’t really talking anymore.
Josie: I think Minx is just gonna make to leave without saying anything.
Minna: I think Myra glances at Blaire and probably follows.
Kim: Yeah, Blaire is probably the last to leave, because I’m a bleeding heart.
Rhi: The door closes behind the three of you and Rigney just buries his head in his hands at the table.
## Downtime [1:17:50]
Rhi: Okay! Let’s do our downtime scenes. Let’s start off with Myra and Blaire.
Minna: I think Myra goes to knock tentatively at her door, because she’s usually not the one who does this.
Kim (as Blaire): [strained] Yeah?
Minna (as Myra): Hey, it’s me.
Kim (as Blaire): [grunt]
Minna (as Myra): Can I come in?
Kim (as Blaire): Um… Yeah, yeah you can, just hang on a second.
Minna (as Myra): Okay.
Kim: You hear a little bit of shuffling behind the door, some locks definitely being unbolted, and Blaire is going to very slowly open the door. This is probably the first time you’ve seen her room, but I want to hear from you what you think you notice.
Minna: Oh boy. What is her room like? It’s just like a mess?
Kim: Uh, yeah, it’s pretty much an organized mess.
Minna: Is there anything obviously ghosts? [laughs]
Kim: Yes. Yeah, she has at least two shelves of ghost jars and—
Minna: Okay, she’s definitely noticing that! [laughs]
Rhi: Jesus. Take those with you when you go on this rescue mission.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, I will.
Minna: I think her eyes dart there and then she forces herself to focus on Blaire instead.
Minna (as Myra): Hey… I don’t want to be alone and I figured you probably don’t want to be alone and Minx is not in a state to be here.
Kim (as Blaire): No, one is fine, but… if you don’t want to be alone I can be with you.
Minna (as Myra): Okay… [exhales] I hate this. I hate everything about this.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah, I hate this too.
Minna (as Myra): So, I’ve been slowly telling you about Salia, but I didn’t tell you how much, how bad this is that she’s suddenly interested again, or I guess she probably never stopped. I just hate that she gets her fingers into everything, and she does this to people, this is just what she does. I hate that Rigney’s caught in it. I hate it.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah… you’re right, but—Listen, you don’t have to go through the whole story right now, you can…
Minna (as Myra): No, I’m not trying to. I just thought I was free, as free as you can be in this city.
Kim (as Blaire): I know. Just, I feel so bad for Rigney, and I’m really worried about Minx…
Minna (as Myra): I know, I know. It feels…
Kim (as Blaire): … [tearful] and I want Phin back, and I don’t know, maybe, I don’t know, it’d be, y’know, someone else to help deal with this?
Minna (as Myra): It felt safer when she was here, didn’t it?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Before all of this.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah it did.
Minna: I think Myra’s gonna tentatively put a hand, almost like she is open for a hug, on her shoulder/back of her neck.
Kim: yeah, Blaire’s gonna take it.
Kim (as Blaire): [tearful] I just… We feel really small now.
Minna (as Myra): I know.
Kim (as Blaire): There was a lot of people there.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I know.
Kim (as Blaire): And I hate feeling small.
Minna (as Myra): I hate it so much.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t want to be small anymore.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t want to feel like this ever again. We’re not small. We can do something about this. We’re just gonna have to figure out how. We’re just gonna have to figure it out. I’m not letting her win. I’m not letting this win, you know? I don’t know how I feel about Salia dying though… I’m just gonna say it. I don’t know how to discuss that.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t have to talk about it. I know that’s complicated. We don’t have to think about that right now either. What matters right now is helping Rigney’s brother, and helping Rigney, and…
Minna (as Myra): If we can just get that under control I think it will start feeling—That’s a lie. It won’t start feeling under control, but it will be better if we can get that thing done, get the next thing done, and just try and bit by bit take it back.
Kim (as Blaire): We have to help Minx come back around too.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. I don’t… [sighs] It feels like what happened to Phin, and it feels like we’re gonna lose her too, but that’s not what’s gonna happen. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.
Kim (as Blaire): [sniffs]
Minna (as Myra): I shouldn’t have said that. It’s not gonna happen.
Kim (as Blaire): [sobbing] How do you know? What if it does?
Minna (as Myra): We already kept one of the people she cares about safe. If we can just… Phin only left because it became too hot to have her here. We just have to find a way to protect the people we care about, because otherwise I don’t know… I’m not used to caring about this many people an di don’t want to lose any of them, so we’re not going to.
Kim (as Blaire): No, I don’t either. When Minx set off that charge I was so scared that she just threw her life away… for what?
Minna (as Myra): I know.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t want it to be after that. I don’t want it to be this that we lose her over.
Minna (as Myra): No, and maybe we need to tell her that. Maybe we need to come to some kind of agreement about how we handle this kind of thing, but I do think it was because of Harker.
Kim (as Blaire): All I know is that I just don’t want to be alone again. I don’t want to go back to just roaming the catacombs by myself, you know, for weeks on end not knowing if I would ever be able to get back home.
Minna (as Myra): Do you want to go back home?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, someday, but I’m happy where I am right now and my family still doesn’t know I was kicked out of school, so it’s gonna be tough to explain.
Minna (as Myra): Of all the things you’re gonna have to explain about your life, Blaire, I don’t think they’re gonna mind about the school.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know, it’s been so long.
Minna (as Myra): And they should be proud of you.
Kim (as Blaire): Why?
Minna (as Myra): Because you’re you. Do you know how much you’ve already…? Did you hear any of what Phin said when she was leaving? Do you realize…? Sorry, I don’t know how to… I’m proud of you, and you’re one of the best friends I’ve ever had, all of you are, and I don’t want to go back to being alone either, but when and if you decide to go home you should be proud of what you became here.
Kim (as Blaire): [tearful] Thanks, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm. Do you prefer to be left alone for this?
Kim (as Blaire): Um, yeah… Yeah, I do.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. Thank you for listening.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks for checking in.
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm. Okay! I’m just gonna—You know where to find me. Heh.
Minna: And Myra’s going to leave the room.
Rhi: I think as Myra leaves Blaire’s room we cut across, the camera pans across and we come out to… Where do we find Minx?
Josie: This is probably right after her shift is done, so that might actually be in the morning. Nyryx has just gotten back and there’s a sheepish knock on the door.
Rhi: If she works night shifts she usually sleeps during the day, so I think she’s in the process of taking down her hair and is probably just wearing a robe. I think she kind of looks at the door and reaches behind some sort of nice vase that she has and picks up a… basically the equivalent of a baseball bat. [laughs]
Josie: I’m gay about this. Continue.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Who is it~?
Josie (as Minx): Hi Nyryx… It’s Ellie.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh…
Rhi: She puts the thing down and opens up.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Hey! What’s…?
Josie: Minx still has her hair down and she’s wearing usual fancy clothes but they’re not composed in any way.
Rhi: She just threw stuff on?
Josie: Yeah, pretty much.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Hi… You’re not usually here this early. Are you okay?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, I’m okay. Kind of a sore back, but I just really needed to see you.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Okay… um, yeah, come on in.
Rhi: She opens up the door and ushers you in.
Josie (as Minx): You’re doing okay, right?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yeah, of course.
Josie (as Minx): No one’s been getting rowdy or anything? Because, you know I’m here, right? Like, if any shit goes down with that.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Tesslyn has plenty of guards on staff as well, but yes, I know. No, I haven’t had any problems. It’s been fine.
Josie (as Minx): Okay, good. Good.
Rhi (as Nyryx): You don’t look fine.
Josie (as Minx): Eh, I mean, I had a rough go of it a few nights ago, but you’re fine so I’m fine. You’re fine, and Harker’s fine, and they’re all fine, so I’m fine.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Wait, Harker? What happened with… What’s going on with Harker?
Josie (as Minx): Y-You know, someone who doesn’t like us very much went through him a little bit, but he’s fine.
Rhi: She covers her mouth in shock.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh… Should I—Oh. Maybe I should tell the guards to keep a closer eye out?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, maybe.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I can do that.
Josie (as Minx): Would it be all right if I chilled out in the lobby for a little? Because… I don’t know, I need you to be okay.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Um…
Josie (as Minx): Like, not to get too clingy.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Can you stay here today? I mean, I need to sleep, but if you stay here or come back this evening you can walk me over and I’ll check and make sure that it’s okay for you to stay in the lobby for a little bit. I’m sure it will be, but I just wanna…
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, totally. I’ll be right here.
Josie: And it’s also clear that in her clothes Minx still has a gun on.
Rhi: Yeah.
Rhi (as Nyryx): All right. Do you want to get some sleep or…?
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] You’re the one who’s been up all night. You should rest. I’ll be right here.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Okay. You know you can talk to me, right?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, yeah, I’m just starting to question whether… what the point of it all is, but just so long as you’re safe there’s a point.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Okay…
Rhi: You get the sense that part of her wants to ask, but the rest of her is half asleep. [laughs] She just got off the night shift. She’s getting ready to go to bed. There’s a moment of hesitation where it seems like she’s gonna ask, and then she doesn’t, and instead she goes over to the door and very pointedly locks it.
Rhi (as Nyryx): You can help yourself to some tea or borrow a book if you’d like, but I’m gonna get some sleep.
Rhi: Oh God. Minx is taller than her, isn’t she? Because Minx is a tall?
Josie: Yup.
Rhi: She comes over and puts her hand on Minx’s shoulder to tug her down and gives her a kiss on the cheek.
Josie: [squeals]
Rhi: [laughs] And then she’s gonna finish getting ready for bed. God, I think the scene we fade out on is Nyryx sleeping peacefully in bed with Minx sitting in an armchair that she’s dragged in front of the door, just watching.

Season 2, Episode 13: The Brother’s Keeper Score
Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us. We remain very, very close to our next Patreon goal of $300 a month. If we can get just a few more backers, we’ll be able to start posting transcripts even faster. Right now we have transcripts up through Episodes 10 and 11 of Season 1. We’ve made a lot of progress, but there’s a long way to go.
So please, if you can support us on Patreon it would mean so much to us. If you can’t, please spread the word about the show. Tweets, reviews, home-made yard signs, we love it all. No one’s actually done the yard sign thing yet, but that would be really cool if you did.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s Featured Charity.
The National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center is a non-profit dedicated to supporting indigenous women in the United States who are facing domestic violence as well as helping Native American tribes and tribal organizations better respond to domestic violence. Their goals are to show that offenders will be held accountable and that native women and children are entitled to safety from violence within their homes and in their community, justice both on and off tribal lands, and access to services designed by and for native women based on their tribal beliefs and practices. Visit www.niwrc.org/donate to support their work. There will be a link to their site in the show notes.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:01:35]
Rhi: How long do you all think you wait before embarking on this rescue mission?
Josie: If y’all want to wait, you might need to restrain Minx into waiting, because she’s ready to go.
Minna: I feel like we don’t wait long.
Kim: We don’t wait long, but the thing is I feel like Minx needs a little bit of time, maybe a day or two, to cool down.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs] Also I have a back wound.
Rhi: Well, there was at least a day that Minx spent with Nyryx, so it could be the next day. That would just be two days after everything that happened previously with Harker and Rigney.
Kim: [darkly] Mm-hmm.
Minna: [moans]
Josie: Yep…
Rhi: A couple days have passed since all that happened. Where do we find The magpies at the beginning of this planning?
Kim: Obviously we’re planning in The Nest.
Rhi: Yep! [laughs]
Kim: We learned that lesson the hard way.
Rhi: [laughs] yep!
Josie: I think Minx is letting other people take the lead on planning. She’s kind of doing herself up, straightening her hair, making sure her makeup is good, and she’s preparing for a hike so she needs exactly the right canteen.
[giggling]
Rhi: Coordinating the canteen to her outfit.
Josie: Right. If anything she seems oddly chipper and happy to be doing it.
Kim: Huh. That’s weird.
Minna: I feel like Myra would have asked—if they know vaguely where they’re going—Myra wants a vague map. She knows Blaire has been out to The Deathlands. She herself does not know the lay of the land at all out there.
Kim: I think Blaire may have in her journal some hand drawn maps. She can definitely lend those to Myra. You can look those over in the common area.
Minna: Yeah. I feel like we have those spread out over the table.
Kim: Yep. Blaire is in her room at the moment and she is just grabbing and putting together her Deathlands gear, just rummaging through her room and getting everything that she needs.
Rhi: Grabbing some ghost jars, just because well, I’m out there, I may as well.
Kim: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, it’s been a while, I should take you too.
Kim: She puts them in her satchel.
Rhi: Yeah. I think, Blaire, you and the Deathlands Scavengers have kind of an understanding. They’re not super thrilled that you are—I don’t think they know that you’re out here releasing ghosts, because they would not be happy about that if they knew. Mostly it’s just like, if you happen to see some Scavengers while they’re out there you all give each other the “hey, how’s it going” nod and then continue on your separate ways. You don’t really work with them directly a lot. The Deathlands Scavengers have a few safe houses in the ruins out there that they move around. Blaire, you have a rough idea where a couple of them are, but you don’t know all of them, because again it’s not like you’re going over to hang out with them very often.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: But I think you have those locations marked on your map, sort of as a “don’t release ghosts near this area,” because that’s rude.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Exactly. Those are the areas we’re going to want to pay the most attention to, because that’s going to be a good place to start looking for Nevan.
Josie: All right.
Minna: Okay, so he’s with the people who got out?
Kim: He could be on his own or he could be with a group, but…
Rhi: The only way he’s survived this long is being with a group.
Kim: Okay. His home base is one of those Scavenger outposts.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire and Minx are prepping for the trip. Myra is looking over maps. Everyone’s doing their own thing.
Kim: Mm-hmm. At a certain point we all need to get into the common area, that’s the thing.
Josie: I was thinking we were already there, like I was there doing myself up while we’re talking.
Kim: Oh, I see.
Minna: I think Myra has gotten nowhere with deep conversation, so she’s keeping the topic light, just chattering with Minx.
Josie: Which Minx is all too happy to oblige with.
Kim: Blaire has her satchel strapped to her side. She looks very geared up and ready to go.
Kim (as Blaire): How you making out with those maps?
Minna (as Myra): I’m making out okay. I’m just trying to keep their positioning in mind.
Kim (as Blaire): My handwriting isn’t too cryptic?
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Luckily what I wanted was the pictures.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Well, good. Handwriting is hard out there, it’s pretty dark, even with a lantern.
Minna (as Myra): I’m fairly good at making out handwriting.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh yeah, I forgot. That’s like your thing. [giggles]
Josie (as Minx): [giggles]
Minna (as Myra): [giggles] Did you just call me a nerd, Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): me? No. No-no-no. I said that was kind of your thing. I didn’t call you a nerd. I’m the nerd.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I do believe you both can be classified as nerds, but simply for different things.
Kim (as Blaire): [grumbles] But I’m prime nerd, okay?
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Yes dear, you are Nerd Prime.
Kim (as Blaire): I am nerd Supreme!
Josie (as Minx): Alpha Nerd.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you. You will address me as such.
Josie (as Minx): It’s hard to out-nerd a ghost nerd, to be fair. It occurs to me this may be our first time really dealing with what Blaire trades in, essentially.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, that incident with The Lost District was, you know, almost the same thing.
Minna (as Myra): And we started a riot with ghosts.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Hopefully it does not get as rambunctious as that trip did.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m not intending on starting another ghost riot. I don’t want to put another harvester out there, even if it is in The Deathlands.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. Hopefully the Scavengers are friendly?
Kim (as Blaire): Eh, I mean, as friendly as you can be when you’re living in The Deathlands. I haven’t interacted with them much, but you know, if we make ourselves not too threatening or suspicious they may let us wander some of their camps. If you make it out to be like we’re lost or we need supplies they’ll probably help us out. Anything more than that, I don’t think they’re the best at small talk.
Rhi: Was there any info gathering that you wanted to do before heading out?
Kim: Should we just do a group Study to look over the maps and have that be our info gather?
Josie: Yeah, why the heck not.
Kim: That might be just the easiest and quickest way to do it. I don’t think we really need to do anything else, unless you guys need to go get supplies.
Minna: I don’t need to get things necessarily. I was wondering if we wanted to try and narrow down where Nevan would be or if we’re just gonna trial and error out there.
Kim: That’s what I think this Study roll should give us.
Minna: Okay.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: In that case, I don’t mind leading. I’ve got 0 stress.
Minna: I just critted.
Rhi: Nice.
Josie: I got a 4.
Kim: My highest was a 5.
Rhi: Okay. Nobody takes stress, and the result is a critical success.
Kim: Woo.
Rhi: What information are you trying to glean?
Kim: We’re narrowing down Scavenger outposts, so basically what I’m imagining we want to do is eliminate the ones where Nevan is unlikely to be and get some kind of radius of outposts that would be a good place to start.
Rhi: Okay. I think what happens is, Myra, you’re studying these maps for a little bit and after a while something clicks in your brain and you go running off to a bookshelf and grab a history tome off the shelf and page through it. You are able to find, in a book that’s sort of a history of Duskwall that includes some pre-cataclysmic history, there is a map of Dusk wall and the surrounding area before the cataclysm. You bring the book over and set it down next to Blaire’s maps, and you can see this section of ruins is the same as this village here, so that means this village is here, and you’re able to expand on the maps that Blaire has and locate another couple areas where the Deathlands Scavengers might be. Blaire, you know in terms of how they move around and rotate to… You’re able to be like, I know for sure, or I’m 90% sure that they won’t be at these two locations, so I think you narrow it down to them being at one of two places in The Deathlands.
Kim: Okay. Awesome.
Rhi: It’s either ruined village A or ruined village B.
Kim: Got it.
Rhi: I think those two places are not too far away from each other.
Kim: Right. That works.
Rhi: It’s not like you’re gonna be hiking out there for hours and hours and hours to get between the two.
Kim: That’s perfect.
Rhi: Okay! The other thing before we get into starting off the score proper… Has anybody talked with Rigney about making plans for where you’re gonna meet once you get Nevan back into the city?
Josie: I haven’t.
[laughter]
Kim: We know this.
Rhi: This is my shocked face.
Kim: Blaire is definitely going to go to Rigney and check up on him and let him know what the pickup scenario is going to look like. What’s the best location on the map to meet us?
Rhi: I feel like your options are gonna be either The Hound’s Paw or Gaddoc Rail Station. If your plan is to put Nevan on a train and send him to Tycheros, potentially meeting at the rail station.
Kim: I think the rail station would be safer than The Hound’s Paw.
Rhi: I agree, and I think Rigney would agree as well. Rigney is very quiet and doesn’t really—you know, it’s a lot of monosyllabic responses when you’re talking to him. He’s still very racked with guilt about everything.
Kim (as Blaire): So, you have to be there before sundown in the event it ends up being a quick in and out.
Rhi (as Rigney): yeah. I can wait over there.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll find him. Okay?
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, yeah, I know. [sighs] You should get going. I ought to go pick some things up for him so he’s not heading out empty-handed.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Oh, I know. You been holding up okay?
Rhi (as Rigney): Don’t worry about me.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Rhi: Yeah. I think we have that little flashback scene.
## Score [0:12:57]
I guess the three of you are heading out? Jumping right into things?
Kim: Yep!
Josie: Yep. I think technically we’re doing a Transport mission. We’ve never done that before.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] That one definitely is new. I got a 1, a 3, and a 4.
Kim: Whoa.
Rhi: [laughs] You just barely squeak your way into a risky position. You make it through the barrier fine. Blaire has done this enough that she knows when the patrols are, she’s got those lightning rods that she can use to open up a gap in the barrier. Minx and Myra, this is probably a little unnerving for you because this is the first time either of you have gone through the lightning barrier on foot. Last time you did it was on horseback. You were kind of carried through. This is you having to just walk through and trust that Blaire has got a good enough grip on those things that it’s not gonna electrocute you.
Kim: Yeah. It’s no problem.
Rhi: Yeah. You all make it through just fine. I think how I’m gonna do this is, the riskiness will manifest in a little bit, but I want to give you all a chance to just, you know, have a nice, friendly hike.
Minna: Oh, friendly hike through a creepy wasteland.
Rhi: Yep!
Josie: Minx is dressed like an upper-middle class yuppie going on a hike, not someone who’s actually experienced hard wilderness conditions. She’s got a nice canteen, all her clothes are clean.
Minna: That’s a good question. What the fuck does Myra wear to hike? [laughs]
Rhi: Probably pants.
Minna: Yeah. I think it’s just pants and bundled up in a jacket that’s well strapped down.
Rhi: I feel like Myra has split the difference between Minx and Blaire. Blaire is the experienced hiker and is dressed in appropriate gear.
Kim: She is Steve Erwin.
Josie: Minx looks like she just got out of REI.
Rhi: [laughs] In terms of the environment that you find yourselves in, south of the city it’s kind of low, rolling hills. There’s a decent amount of illumination for actually a surprising distance thanks to the lightning barrier, because that’s 200 feet tall of lightning, so it casts a fair amount of light for a while.
Minna: I just imagine it casts this flickering light.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s illuminated, but it’s spooky.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Because it’s flickering and inconsistent light. You can see the dark shapes of dead skeletal trees jutting up here and there. There’s not many of them. There are a lot of mushrooms just growing around in different places. Mushrooms seem to have filled the ecological niche that plants once held, so there’s just all kinds of different types of mushrooms and fungi growing out here. Otherwise, again, it’s kind of that same feeling you all had when you got into The Deathlands the first time, it’s very, very quiet. You can actually hear pretty distantly the waves crashing along the shore, because if you were to head west far enough you would hit the coastline, and it’s quiet enough that the sound carries all the way in to where you are. Yeah, otherwise, Blaire, you’re checking your surroundings, looking for any threats, and nothing is immediately visible as being a problem.
Kim: Right. All very normal.
Josie: Minx is trying to stay towards the front and trying to keep a chipper attitude about things, ward off the fear a little. It’s very clear she’s nervous like she was the first time.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you gonna be warm enough?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, yes, I packed warmly. Unless we are talking freezing temperatures I think I’ll be fine.
Kim (as Blaire): No, it won’t be freezing unless we go really far north, but that’s not where we’re heading. Um, yeah… You look good, but I wanted to make sure you were warm enough for this.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you! Oh yes, I did pick up this rather puffy new jacket.
Josie: She gestures to it. It’s like one of those puffy rain jackets, but clearly designer, a dark blue and around the cuffs of the sleeves there’s some gold embroidery that she did herself.
Kim: Oh my God…
Rhi: Oh God…
Kim: No… Honey.
Rhi: Oh, that’s so good.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): You’re not worried about, you know, getting a little dirty, are ya?
Josie (as Minx): Well, I mean, I don’t intend to soil these clothes any more than is necessary, but it is hiking, yes?
Minna (as Myra): You’re not jumping in any mud puddles.
Josie (as Minx): No, of course not. If things get rough I suppose I shan’t miss this jacket too much.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. I just wanted to make sure that wasn’t precious. That looks… The sleeves look like they took you a long time.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well I don’t slack off on any of my garments.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, as long as you don’t miss it too much in case we get, you know, jumped by something.
Minna (as Myra): What exactly do you expect to be jumped by?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, you know, in case we run into a Deathlands crow or an umbra lion or an ash bear. I don’t expect to run into any of those things, but it’s always a risk and a possibility to cross the wrong paths with the wrong kind of wildlife.
Josie: Minx’s eye twitches a bit more with every new creature you list off.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): And of course there’s always ghosts, but you know, you leave them alone, they’ll leave you alone, at enough distance.
Rhi: That’s not true!
Kim (as Blaire): At enough distance!
Rhi: [laughing] They’re very hungry!
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, they’re not wasps… They’re going to come after us if they’re hungry.
Kim (as Blaire): If they’re hungry, but… we have to make sure that they’re not hungry.
Kim: Blaire is gonna shake a vial on her belt that’s full of ectoplasm.
Josie (as Minx): Given that you are clearly bearing food, won’t that draw them?
Kim (as Blaire): No. No, not unless I tease them, but I won’t do that. It’s sealed enough that they won’t smell it or anything.
Josie (as Minx): [nervously] Very well. I will elect to choose that they won’t bother us unless we bother them, regardless of the truth of the matter. Let’s keep walking.
Kim (as Blaire): The key point is distance!
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I would prefer distance. I think we’re all agreed on that one.
Kim (as Blaire): And I do have spare jars.
Josie: I like to think that when Blaire elevated her voice to say “the key is distance” we hear the echoing out into The Deathlands and the void.
Kim: Oh yes.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah, off the hills.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispering] Oh shit. Sorry.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): [giggling bashfully] I don’t want to wake anything up.
Minna (as Myra): It’s so empty out here.
Kim (as Blaire): Only if you think of it in that way. If you look at it a different way, there’s so much~
Kim: At that, I think Blaire is just gonna put on her spirit mask.
Josie (as Minx): I think I will choose to see it as empty, but I admire your wondrous spirit.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah… So Blaire, looking through the ghost field out here, right now there aren’t a ton of spirits in your immediate vicinity. You can see, glowing off in the distance, the spirit well that you tend to release ghosts near.
Kim: Yes. It’s a great place. Five stars.
Rhi: It glows very brightly with all of the spirits that cluster around it. There’s just the faint life signatures of different things out here. There’s a low-level glow from all of the mushrooms covering everything.
Josie: I think Minx has trail mix, but you know, Starbucks trail mix or something.
Minna: Bougie trail mix.
Josie: Yeah, bougie trail mix.
Kim: Okay. The minute she pulls that out, though, Blaire is going to rush up to her and cover that with her hand.
Kim (as Blaire): You can’t take that out. You cannot, under any circumstances, take out any food, unless we are at an outpost.
Josie (as Minx): [stumbling] All right…
Kim (as Blaire): Do you hear how empty it is? You can hear the wind. The wind will carry any scent of food to any creature in the area, and then we’ll get swarmed.
Josie: Minx sort of pales a bit.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): You can eat as soon as we’re near safe people, but out here in the open where there’s not much, it’s not safe. Okay?
Josie (as Minx): Very well. I’m gonna pack this away.
Josie: She’s gonna open the little backpack she has and shove it all the way to the bottom.
Kim (as Blaire): I just want you to be safe.
Josie (as Minx): No, I believe you. I believe you. I want to be safe as well. Be prepared, as they say.
Kim (as Blaire): Speaking of safe… If you don’t mind me asking, Minx, where did you run off to the other day?
Josie (as Minx): Oh. When I went to see Nyryx? I just wanted to check on her.
Kim (as Blaire): No, before that, after the score.
Josie (as Minx): Ah. Well, I needed to let off some steam as Phin might call it. It’s nothing to worry about, though.
Kim (as Blaire): Did you go to the pits?
Josie (as Minx): No. Heavens, no. I wouldn’t be caught dead or alive in that. It is not a clean place. I went to a more upstanding establishment.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): To socialize or to fight?
Josie (as Minx): Well, one might say that high class socialization is a battle all its own, wouldn’t you?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh my God. Minx. Minx… You know that’s not what I meant.
Josie: Yes Blaire, I went to fight. I needed… Better some arrogant snob than Rigney, yes?
Kim (as Blaire): You really think that about him?
Josie (as Minx): No, it just—I’m hardly one to talk about betraying one’s comrades, but it is one thing to be caught in desperation or a moment of passion or a heat of the moment, and it’s another thing to sit with it, pre-meditate it, with your friends’ lives on the line.
Kim (as Blaire): I get that.
Josie (as Minx): Were it not Rigney, they probably would have been run through on my sword in that moment.
Kim (as Blaire): I understand it’s going to take some time, and it makes sense, it’s more than fair that it’s going to take some time, but I still believe Rigney’s our friend. He’s not a bad guy, and he didn’t want to do this.
Josie (as Minx): I believe that as well, but at the same time, this wasn’t a simple mistake. It’s one thing to put my life on the line, but it’s another to put the life of, you know, my friends, my crew, people I love on the line as well. It takes more than a few moments discussion to get forgiveness on that one, you understand.
Kim (as Blaire): I do. Yeah, I know. I know that’s going to have to take time for you. Myra?
Minna (as Myra): You seemed to be deep in conversation. I didn’t want to interrupt.
Kim (as Blaire): No, I wanted to see how you were doing, what you thought, about Rigney.
Minna (as Myra): I understand the calculus Rigney is doing all too well.
Josie (as Minx): I could imagine.
Minna (as Myra): Salia gives you two choices, bad and worse.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s the other thing we’re gonna have to talk about at some point. We need to figure out a way to take care of her.
Minna (as Myra): I know…
Kim (as Blaire): That can wait. Right now, we can focus on the task at hand.
Josie (as Minx): Quite.
Kim (as Blaire): But we can’t have this happen again. Salia’s going to have to be taken care of, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): I know.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know if that means death, but… something needs to change.
Minna (as Myra): I know. I wish… [exhales] I don’t have a good vision for what that looks like.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m not asking you to have any kind of vision for that yet. I’m just saying.
Minna (as Myra): She’s not untouchable. Nobody can be untouchable.
Kim (as Blaire): Exactly. We find her weakness and we take her down.
Josie (as Minx): Myra, if you don’t mind me asking, how did you get away from Salia?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t think you ever told us.
Minna: I think she just goes silent for a moment, and thoughtful.
Minna (as Myra): I thought it was going to be worse than it was. It turned out that I could just walk away. I mean, she’s clearly not letting me stay away, she’s never been happy about me being away, but the actual walking out was as simple as that. Then I met Phin, after a time working on my own, and then after I met Phin we kept working and then we met all of you.
Josie (as Minx): I’m glad you were able to walk out. It’s not always in one’s power to make that decision on their own.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): I think you got out at just the right time.
Minna (as Myra): Heh.
Kim (as Blaire): If you stayed any longer it would have gotten worse.
Minna (as Myra): If I stayed any longer I’d be like Ojal or Clave, or Wester I suppose.
Kim (as Blaire): Or dead.
Minna (as Myra): I’m too valuable to her for her to have killed me while I was under her control.
Kim (as Blaire): But an accident could have happened while you were doing something for her, you know?
Minna (as Myra): An accident could happen while I’m doing things for us. That’s the life.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but [chuckle] at least this way it’s worth it.
Minna (as Myra): It’s worth it, and far more dangerous physically.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear. We’re an upgrade in the danger from Salia? I’m not sure how to feel about that.
Minna (as Myra): Salia doesn’t normally do this. The kind of thing that we do is much more hands on. I mean, I suppose I did infiltration kinds of things, but usually just posing as somebody else, not with the stakes that we… I never got stabbed and shot and hit as much as I have in the months that I’ve known you.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] I have a feeling Phin would have taken that as a compliment. I’m not sure how to take that.
Minna (as Myra): It’s the price we pay for standing up against people like her.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s right, and we’re lucky enough to have Seeks too. She definitely helps.
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): That is true. Although, just once I’d like the wound I suffer not to be from a bullet.
Minna (as Myra): That would be lovely.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, don’t worry, there’s not a lot of bullets out here. It’s mostly claws and fangs.
Josie (as Minx): [shivering] Oh, quite.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, don’t say that…
Rhi: On that, there’s a sort of change in the air that you can’t quite pin down why it’s happening or what it is, but it’s just a sudden tension, and then there’s a low growl and a flicker in front of you. It seems as if something emerges from the ghost field.
Kim: Oh no. Is this an umbra lion?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. I was torn between this and a blood slime, and then you said fangs and claws and that sealed the deal for me. Thanks for that. What you see, crouching low on the ground in front of you, is a large feline, for our reference it’s about the size of a panther. It has dappled gray and black fur, and you can see its eyes glinting with that ghost field light as it looks at the three of you, sizing you up. This is that risky engagement triggering. The reason it’s risky and not desperate is that you see it coming. [laughs] You have a chance to react before it pounces.
Kim (as Blaire): Nobody… move…
Rhi: It’s vision is not based on movement, just so you know.
Josie: And it saw us–
Minna: [bursts into laughter]
Kim: If we run, it will chase us.
Rhi: Yes, that is correct.
Minna: [laughing] How many Jurassic Park references is this show gonna have?
Kim: Several, if it’s up to me.
Josie: I have an idea. I think Minx probably read a basic survivor’s manual.
Rhi: Oh no…
Minna: The worst case scenario for Duskwall.
Josie: Yes, and knows that when there’s a cautious predator around you try to make yourself look big to dissuade it from attacking.
Rhi: Oh no.
Kim: [inhales deeply]
Minna: [breathless] Honey…
Josie: I think this would normally be a Command, but I would like to use Rook’s Gambit to use Sway instead, to puff myself up, have my hand on my weapon, and try to just seem unworried so hopefully it hesitates or decides we’re not worth it. We do out number it.
Rhi: [smiling] Okay. You’re trying to bluff the big panther?
Josie: Yes.
Kim: It’s not a bad strategy.
Josie: Can I do Sway off the bat?
Rhi: So, you’re trying to make yourself look unfrightened?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. I’ll let you do Sway for that. It’s gonna be risky, and I think reduced effect, because you’re trying to convey via body language to a non-human creature.
Josie: Yeah. Oh God. Does that also mean my wound penalty applies, because It’s kind of physical?
Rhi: I’ll leave it up to you to decide how much physicality there is in it, if that’s aggravating your back.
Josie: I have a bullet wound in my back. I think it makes sense for me to take the penalty on that. I did get a 6 though, I did get a 6, but at reduced effect.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re at reduced effect. It’s eyes flick over to Minx, and Minx puffs herself up as much as possible, and Minx is also the tallest member of the party, and tries to look intimidating. The umbra lion stares you down for a couple seconds and then shifts its attention away from Minx. It has decided Minx is probably not worth the trouble, but it is now… I’m gonna roll to see which one of you it’s focusing on. It is now looking at Blaire.
Kim: Okay!
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: That glow in its eyes starts to get brighter. Blaire or Myra, one of you will have an opportunity to act before it does anything.
Kim: I would like to act since its attention is on me. Blaire is going to remain completely quiet and still. Her movement is going to be very calculated. The only thing she’s going to do is reach for her spirit mask, put it on, and I would like to roll Attune to see if there’s any way I can communicate to this creature that we are not a threat.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Go ahead.
Kim: That’s a 2, a 5, and a 5.
Rhi: Okay, so a 5. Here’s what happens. Blaire, you put on your spirit mask and you look into the ghost field. Normally when you’re looking at living creatures in the ghost field they are kind of washed out, ghosts are brighter. As you are looking at the umbra lion it gets brighter. Minx and Myra, you see the umbra lion vanish—
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: –and then Blaire, you’re getting knocked over as this thing pounces on you. It snaps out of the ghost field just before it makes contact, so it slams into you, knocks you down, it’s growling in your face, and you are gonna take level 2 harm as this thing has knocked you over and is clawing at you. You can resist it.
Kim: Yeah, I would like to resist. What am I rolling to resist it? Would it be Prowess?
Rhi: Prowess, yeah. I feel like every time you guys go into The Deathlands Blaire gets tackled by some large ghost creature.
Kim: Okay, but the thing is, in my head I’m imagining this as a playful Lion King pounce. “Pinned you again!”
Rhi: … It’s not. It wants to eat you. [laughs]
Kim: I know that it’s not, but in my head…
Rhi: Blaire is interpreting it as “Oh! It’s saying hi!—Oh God!”
[laughter]
Kim: Yeah, basically. Okay, so my highest on that resistance roll was a 6.
Rhi: Okay. You take no stress. It’s level 1 harm instead.
Kim: Level 1 harm, Tackled?
Rhi: Yeah. Most of this damage is coming from you getting slammed into the ground and having the wind knocked out of you, but you’re wearing enough layers and padding and stuff that the claws aren’t quite able to get into you. There is still a panther standing on top of you pinning you to the ground.
Kim: Yep, and it’s invisible to Minx and Myra.
Rhi: No, it is visible now.
Kim: Oh! I see.
Rhi: So, Myra? You haven’t done anything yet. How would you like to deal with this situation?
Minna: What I would like to do is see if I can maybe roll Study or something to see if, while we were getting ready for this, I found anything about the most common creatures of The Deathlands and how to survive them.
Rhi: This one sounds like more of a flashback?
Minna: Okay! Either way, just either a Study to see if I remember or a flashback that I looked them up.
Rhi: Well, it’ll be a flashback. You’ll roll a Study in the flashback to see what you learned.
Minna: Oh, okay, perfect. Yeah. I got a 5.
Rhi: You were able to find a bestiary of The Deathlands that talks about a lot of the creatures out there. Unfortunately it was written from a more sensationalist standpoint than anything remotely scientific.
Minna: Hmm…
Rhi: You get a description of the creatures that matches. Basically what you know is that the only kind of weakness that these creatures have is that they’re solitary. They have very sharp claws and fangs, they have excellent hearing and night vision and scent, they can phase into the ghost field.
Minna: So they’re just weak because they don’t have a pack to hunt with?
Rhi: Right. The fact that you outnumber it is basically your biggest advantage right now. You do also know that umbra lion hides fetch a fine price in the city.
Kim: [whispering] Don’t kill this.
Minna: [giggles]
Kim: It’s very big, and angry, and on top of me. Do not kill it.
Rhi: [chuckles]
Minna: I think Myra shouts:
Minna (as Myra): Okay Minx, you and I need to be in two different directions from it, trying to get its attention.
Josie (as Minx): [nervously] Very well.
Minna (as Myra): There’s going to be only one of it, so our best chance is to team up, confuse it, and strike at it from two angles.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. Surrounding it is.
Rhi: All right. Myra, what are you gonna do to try and draw its attention or draw it off?
Minna: I think I’m gonna have a large weapon, and it’s like a larger gun, so I shoot one into the air and it makes a very loud bang and I’m ready to use it on the umbra lion next.
Rhi: Go ahead and make a roll…
Minna: What is this roll going to be? It could be a Command.
Rhi: I feel like you could do it as… I would allow—Command, or Sway… well, probably Command.
Minna: I like Command, especially since I’m trying to intimidate. Also I’m better at Command.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Can I throw in an assist on that?
Rhi: Sure. What are you doing to assist?
Josie: I’m on the other side of it and I’m trying to get its visual attention. I’ve got my sword out and waving it at its face a little bit.
Rhi: Okay. You’re trying to distract it visually from one side and Myra’s making a loud noise on the other.
Minna: All three of my dice rolled 4.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay! You do it, but there’s a consequence. Myra, you get its attention. It jumps off of Blaire, and it disappears again.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim: Blaire definitely still has her spirit mask on. She would know where it is.
Rhi: Blaire, you see the creature running and about to leap at Myra. You’ve got enough time to give her a warning, but Myra is gonna be in a desperate position because this thing is about to connect.
Kim: Blaire is gonna roll to her feet, she’s going to get a sight of where it is, and she’s gonna shout:
Kim (as Blaire): Myra! Look out!
Minna: I’m gonna assume this is gonna be maybe a Finesse roll?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Hmm…
Minna: Ooh, I have a good one.
Rhi: Yeah?
Minna: Because this is a rifle, it’s a Duskwall gun, it probably needs reloading every shot. I drop my ammo and I’m gonna have to scramble for it if I want to shoot this thing.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. I like that.
Minna: Six! Hell yeah!
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Yeah. Mark a point of experience because that was desperate.
Minna: It probably is less effect because I’m shot with cracked ribs.
Rhi: Yes. Thank you all for reminding me of your various and sundry injuries.
Minna: I remembered for once in my god damn life.
Rhi: [laughs] On reduced effect, what it is, you dodge out of the way but you’re still in a desperate position. It pops out of the ghost field and lands right next to you and turns on you and is snarling. It is clearly getting ready for a second attack.
Josie: I would like to, while its attention is on Myra, I just want to barrel into its side and knock it over.
Kim: Oh boy. Oh boy.
Rhi: Oh, all right.
Josie: Hey, I’m reckless now.
Rhi: Yeah, no, that tracks.
Josie: I’m shoulder-checking the panther, with -1 die because it’s a physical thing.
Rhi: For you this is gonna be risky, because it’s attention is on Myra.
Josie: And I’m rolling Skirmish. I got a 6. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. You tackle the umbra lion. I don’t know if you had a follow-up plan to what you were gonna do once you had tackled it. [laughs]
Josie: Can I follow it up with something? I wasn’t intending to be in a grapple with it. I was gonna barrel into its side and shoulder-check it over.
Rhi: Okay, just knock it over and give Myra a second to back off?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, you can do that. I guess if you had gotten a 5 then you would still be entangled with it, but yeah, I think you’re able to knock into it.
Josie: My intended follow-up is to just start stabbing down at it with my sword.
Kim: [breathy yelp]
Rhi: I will allow it. Does anybody else have anything that they want to do?
Kim: Scream?
Kim (as Blaire): [whining] Minx, stop! Stop!
Josie: Minx hesitates with the sword above it.
Josie (as Minx): What? Why?!
Kim: She’s gonna probably stand between the lion and Minx. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I don’t think the dramatic gesture is necessary, Blaire, but we are kind of on the line here.
Kim (as Blaire): No, I know, but don’t hurt it! We can get it to go away. Even if you wanna kill it, you’d ruin the hide.
Rhi: [laughing] Blaire’s priorities! Don’t kill it, it’s an innocent, beautiful creature, but if we must kill it make sure it’s worth something.
Josie (as Minx): How do you suggest we get rid of it? It’s right behind you.
Rhi: Yeah. I will say, I think it’s fallen back a couple steps and it’s still doing that low down to the ground hunting cat thing, and it seems to just be watching all of you. It’s not moving to attack again.
Kim: I have a proposal. Being that this is a creature that’s semi-corporeal, do you think it would be tempted if I threw a bit of ectoplasm at it?
Rhi: Hmm. Let’s find out. [laughs]
Kim: okay. Do I need to roll anything to toss some ectoplasm in its direction?
Rhi: Yeah, you’re gonna need to roll something to get it over there.
Kim: Can I make an argument for Finesse?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, just have it be one swift motion, she uncorks the vial and tosses a small portion of it. What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: This is gonna use up all of the electroplasm that you have.
Kim: Aww… No, I’ll just push myself instead. It was a 2 and a 6.
Rhi: You toss some of it out there and its eyes track the motion of it, and then it slinks over and gets down real low and sniffs at it. I think, because we’ve said that ghosts just sort of drain the life essence from it… If you have an idea, go for it.
Kim: I like to think that it kind of eats it in a more traditional way, because it is still a bit of a corporeal creature.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s primarily corporeal.
Kim: Right. What it does is laps it and eats it up like a cat would a treat.
Josie: Aw.
Kim: It hooks it between its paws and it’s just very happy. It’s tasty.
Rhi: Well, it’s more of a liquid, right? So it laps it up.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Then its eyes are glowing noticeably brighter, and then it takes a couple steps backwards, slinking off, and then it just disappears again.
Kim (as Blaire): Phew.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna take off her spirit mask.
Rhi: Blaire, before you take off your spirit mask, I will say you can see it bounding away.
Kim: Oh good.
Josie (as Minx): Well, now that we’ve preserved a glorious and proud beast of nature, can we go back to the city yet?
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): We still have to find Nevan.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Yes. We were out here for a reason. Ahem.
Kim (as Blaire): The sooner we find him the sooner we can get back to Duskwall, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): Quite.
Rhi: With the umbra lion chased off into the darkness the three of you continue on towards the first of the two sites that were identified as probable sites where the Deathlands Scavengers would be. I’m gonna say that the one that you are closest to, thank you Minna for these names, is Blue Hill, the ruins of the village Blue Hill, and I think that it is on the River Dosk, so you all just start following the river along. I want to have somebody make some kind of roll to determine if they’re here or not. I could just do a fortune roll, or if somebody wants to do something like tracking to look around for evidence that people have been here recently or are here.
Kim: I don’t mind rolling Survey just to look around.
Rhi: Okay. Go for it.
Kim: That’s a 2.
Rhi: Blaire, as you approach this first village, you can tell pretty quickly that nobody’s here and it looks like nobody’s been here for a while. There’s a new layer of dust, some fresh mushrooms sprouting up on things, it doesn’t look like people have been here for a little while.
Kim: It’s super abandoned? There’s no items left behind or anything?
Rhi: You can search around if you want to try to look for anything, but yeah, it doesn’t look like the Scavengers have been through here in a while.
Josie: I might as well throw a Survey out.
Rhi: Sure.
Kim: Nope. That’s a 2.
Minna: I rolled a 5 on a Study check.
Josie: “They’re taking the hobbits to Isengard.”
Rhi: Okay, so—[chuckles]
Kim: Thank you.
Josie: [smiling] No problem.
Rhi: On a 2, yeah… Minx, you are just trying not to touch stuff, because there’s a lot of mushrooms and dust and dirt and soot, and it’s just not…
Josie: Egh.
Rhi: Everything is kind of grimy. So, your Survey is standing very still in the middle of a room and just turning your head to look around without touching anything or moving much.
Josie: [laughs] Yes. I’m not quite ready to dirty this jacket yet.
Rhi: Myra, you are poking around, looking at things, and you start to notice that there are symbols carved into the walls, and after a second you recognize them as the same kind of symbols that are on spirit bane charms.
Minna: Ohh. I think she brushes her fingers along them.
Minna (as Myra): I think these are charmed to keep out ghosts.
Kim (as Blaire): Did you find something?
Minna (as Myra): Come look at this, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Whoa.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire, you immediately know what this is. They are runes and wards to try to keep ghosts out, which makes sense that the Deathlands Scavengers would put up things like that, but as you’re looking, there’s a lot on here, like way more than would typically be necessary.
Kim (as Blaire): Whoever was living here was either paranoid or attacked.
Kim: She’s gonna copy a couple into her journal.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps repeated passing through by the Scavengers required them to be refreshed?
Kim (as Blaire): No. Once you put something down it’s good pretty much forever as long as the surface isn’t destroyed. This is excessive.
Rhi: Blaire, this would be something where they were either trying to ward off a huge number of ghosts or a smaller number of very powerful spirits.
Kim: Or a harvester?
Rhi: Or a harvester, or, as you said, somebody was very paranoid. It’s possible that’s why this site isn’t in use at the moment.
Kim (as Blaire): I think our next stop is Cairsford.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. We should move out of this worrisome place.
Rhi: You continue on across The Deathlands. I’m gonna do a quick fortune roll to see what kind of interesting things happen on your way. Ooh, those are bad interestings.
Kim: Oh dear.
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: I rolled a 1 and a 2.
Kim: Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha…
Minna: I love Kim’s bad roll laugh.
[laughter]
Kim: [musically] Give me something spooky to kiss~
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Yes! Good. That is the right attitude.
Kim: [giggles] I’m just thinking ahead, guys.
Rhi: You start walking again in the direction of the other village that you had planned to head towards. You’re walking for a little while, 15 or 20 minutes, and Minx I think you hear it first, this faint whispering at the edge of your hearing, too quiet to make out the words exactly, but you can tell that there is a voice.
Josie (as Minx): Hello?
Kim (as Blaire): Hmm? Did you say something?
Josie (as Minx): I heard a voice from the clearing.
Kim (as Blaire): You heard a voice?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I didn’t quite make it out.
Rhi: Blaire, you hear something, a couple voices now, whispering.
Kim: can I make out any words?
Rhi: I don’t think so. It’s still just a little too quiet.
Kim (as Blaire): Wait. I hear it, too.
Rhi: Myra, as the other two are mentioning these voices you see a flicker of light movement in the corner of your eye, but when you turn there isn’t anything there.
Minna (as Myra): Huh…
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t think we’re alone, guys.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think so either.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that is precisely the thing someone says before something attacks them. I vote we press onward? Or are we gonna try to address these stragglers?
Kim (as Blaire): Let me try taking a look.
Kim: I’m gonna look into the ghost field again with my mask.
Rhi: Okay. You look into the ghost field, and they haven’t fully surrounded the three of you yet, but there’s a couple dozen ghosts sort of in a loose, wide circle drifting in towards you.
Kim: Uh-huh?
Josie: A couple dozen, you said?
Rhi: [matter-of-factly] A couple dozen.
Josie: Oh…
Rhi: Blaire, now that you’re looking at the ghost field you can start to make out the whispering. “Hungry. So hungry. Food. Finally. Life. Food. Hungry.” They’re closing in.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, what do your Tycherosi eyes see?
Kim (as Blaire): [smiling] Friends~
Rhi: No.
[laughter]
Kim: [giggles]
Rhi: Blaire, you don’t have enough jars for this.
Kim: But I might have enough ectoplasm.
Rhi: No~
Minna: [nervous noises]
Kim: The spirit well is nearby?
Rhi: You can make a roll to see if you can spot anything, but remember, spirit wells are McDonalds, you all are perfectly cooked steaks.
Minna: I love that you’ve kept this simile.
Josie (as Minx): Please tell me they are friends in the traditional sense and not the sort that needs to be persuaded not to eat us.
Kim: [laughs] What do you suggest I roll, Rhi?
Rhi: Probably Attune would let you see through the ghost field to see if there’s a spirit well nearby, or if you want to roll something else to look for other options…?
Kim: No, I feel confident in Attune. Devil’s Bargain?
Rhi: Oh man. I will offer you this Devil’s Bargain from Simon Landerville, one of our backers on Patreon.
Josie: Yay!
Kim: Thank you!
Rhi: The consequence of this action will haunt your dreams for some time.
Kim: I can deal with that.
Rhi: [forebodingly] All right.
Kim: Blaire has weird dreams all the time.
Josie: Give us those sweet, sweet nightmares.
Kim: My highest on that was a 5.
Rhi: Okay. You do spot, off in the distance, farther south, farther from the city than you’ve ever ventured, the distant glow of what you suspect is a spirit well. However, in the time that it takes for you to spot it the ghosts close in and close the circle around you. You all are encircled by hungry ghosts.
Minna: Remember that thing where we have to roll to keep our cool in the presence of ghosts?
Rhi: Yeah…
Minna: I’m definitely at that point.
Rhi: I think Minx and Myra both are gonna have to do this, because this is a lot of ghosts.
Josie: Even though we can’t see them, we can, like…
Rhi: You can sense them. the whispering is very loud now. It has gotten very cold.
Josie: Yeah…
Rhi: You can tell as almost an animal instinct of preservation that you are surrounded. Both of you are going to take level 2 harm, Panicked, unless you roll Resolve to resist, to stand your ground.
Josie: I’m gonna try and resist it.
Minna: Yeah, I’m gonna try and resist it, too.
Josie: I got a 4.
Rhi: You’ll take 2 points of stress.
Minna: Six.
Josie: Uh-huh, but it gets reduced to level 1 harm?
Rhi: I will actually leave it to both of your discretion. I will say you can either just shake it off entirely or level 1 harm, Shaken.
Josie: I think I’m gonna take the Shaken, because that is fitting for Minx.
Minna: I think shake it off entirely, just because I rolled a 6.
Rhi: You got a 6. Yeah. So, what do you all want to do about this situation? [chuckles]
Josie: I think Minx is gonna pull out her spirit bane charm and put it in front of her like a holy emblem and hope it does something, because she’s a little shaken and not okay with this.
Minna: I think Myra’s terrified, but she manages to pull herself together, because that’s how you survive this.
Rhi: Yep.
Minna: Damn, I do not know what to do about this, though.
Kim: I kind of want to do some kind of social roll, either Command or Consort them to go to the spirit well nearby.
Rhi: Yeah. You have had some success with that in the past.
Kim: I have, and since then I do have 1 rank in Command. Is anyone good for an assist?
Minna: I’m good for an assist.
Kim: Okay. Thank you. So, my highest on that was a 5.
Rhi: That still means you do it. Tell me what you say to the ghosts.
Kim: I think Blaire very calmly and firmly, and still with her spirit mask on so she can see what’s going on, says:
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t want to hurt us. There’s a spirit well just down the way.
Rhi: There’s another murmur of whispers that goes through the crowd of “Hungry. Hungry. So hungry. Not enough. There’s not enough of them. There won’t be enough.” Most of the ghosts drift off.
Kim: Okay, with the exception of how many would you say, one or two?
Rhi: Three.
Kim: Okay, three remain.
Rhi: [laughing] There’s three ghosts left that kind of hang back and are like “well now there’s one for each of us.”
Kim: Okay… However ,however, I always have empty jars. I have one that’s empty. My other two already have captured ghosts that I plan on releasing, so this is all I can do. I’m going to attempt to jar one of the ghosts. Would that be an Attune?
Rhi: I think so.
Kim: Okay. The highest on that one was a 4.
Rhi: You step out towards the ghosts. One of them starts to move towards you, and right when it gets really close you snap out with the jar and it gets sucked in. Unfortunately, that means that you aren’t really defending against the other one that closes in and, because it’s a ghost, it’s gonna try and possess you.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re gonna have to roll to resist being possessed by a spoopy ghost.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 6, boi~
Rhi: You don’t take any stress. You manage to, as you have done in the past, just shield your mind and your soul against this ghost. Minx and Myra?
Josie: [apprehensively] Minx is gonna look into the ghost field, I think.
Kim: Yay!~!
Rhi: Yeah!
Josie: She doesn’t do that often.
Rhi: Minx, you are able to see there’s two ghosts basically flanking Blaire, and Blaire is holding a brightly glowing jar in her hands from the ghost that she caught.
Josie: [laughing] Seeing that they’re right next to Blaire, this is gonna do nothing, but I think Minx is gonna want to stab at one with her sword.
Kim: Oh, honey…
Josie: Yeah. It’s gonna do nothing, but she’s just like:
Kim: Minx…
Josie (as Minx): No! Get away from her!
Rhi: Yeah. This is gonna be risky and zero effect, so you can push yourself to get reduced effect, but otherwise it’s not gonna have any effect.
Josie: I’m rolling a Skirmish for no effect. I got a 5, so I succeed at doing nothing. [laughs]
Rhi: You run over and you slash at the ghost, and it doesn’t harm the ghost, but it gets the ghost’s attention.
Josie: Yay…
Rhi: The ghost is no longer focused on Blaire. The ghost is now very focused on you.
Josie (as Minx): You should pick on someone your own size, yes, you ought to—Can we leave now?
Kim (as Blaire): minx! I had it handled! What are you doing?
Josie (as Minx): It was about to eat you!
Kim (as Blaire): No it wasn’t! I had it under control!
Josie (as Minx): It still seems really freaking hungry.
Rhi: Is Minx just like backing up slowly?
Josie: Yeah, kind of. [laughs]
Rhi: Myra?
Minna: Anything to avoid being possessed.
Rhi: All right.
Kim: Fair.
Rhi: You could roll a number of things. You could do Attune. You could possibly do Command.
Minna: I think Command feels very Myra. And I rolled a 4.
Rhi: Okay. What do you say?
Minna: I think she holds up her spirit bane charm in her hand. It’s not shaking. It’s taking a lot of effort, but it’s not shaking. She is standing confident, and she says:
Minna (as Myra): [severely] You will not come any closer to me.
Rhi: Myra, you say that and the ghosts, both of them, drift backwards from the force of will that you are putting behind this spirit bane charm. Both Minx and Blaire, you see these two ghosts just drift off, not quite going all the way down to the spirit well, but they’re backing off.
Josie (as Minx): I do think that is our cue to move, I’d imagine.
Kim (as Blaire): Was that you, Myra?
Minna (as Myra): Yes. I wasn’t about to let them get close to us.
Kim (as Blaire): Understandable.
Josie (as Minx): It was rather impressive.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you do that so steady.
Minna (as Myra): I guess when the time came down to it, it was staying steady or giving in.
Rhi: You continue on, again still following the river and then you veer off into the hills. This time, as you start approaching, you can tell that this is the right spot. They have generators to put up small lightning barriers, to create little safe pockets. There’s some lightning flashing, there’s lantern light and fires, you can see people moving in the light there. As you get close a couple people, a pair of women both holding rifles basically, step forward. They’re not aiming the rifles at you, but they’ve got them up so they can swing around to aim.
Rhi (as Woman): Hey. Who goes there? Who are ya?
Kim (as Blaire): We’re here to look for someone, one of your own.
Rhi: They eye the three of you.
Rhi (as Woman): All right. Come on, then.
Rhi: They lower the rifles. One of them slings it over her shoulder. They usher you into the camp. They seem to be some of the guards that are just posted around the edge of camp. So, the Deathlands Scavengers. They are camped out in the ruins of this village. There’s a couple dozen people here from what you can see. Everybody is armed just as a matter of course. A lot of people have spirit bane charms and other sorts of charms and wards hanging off their clothing, on their belts, things like that. Most people seem to be engaged in maintenance or guarding or just general camp activities of cooking or boiling water or repairing equipment. There’s a handful of people sitting by one of the fires seemingly sorting through a large pile of stuff. You all get some curious looks, but it’s basically, you’re not actively hurting people, [laughs] so they assume that it’s like, eh, you know, you’re here, you need shelter, so you’re fine. So, you have made it to the Deathlands Scavengers’ camp. What would you like to do?
Josie: I want to find Nevan.
Kim: Yeah. We should roll to find Nevan.
Rhi: All right. How do you wanna do that?
Josie: I want to be chummy and amicable. I just want to Consort and ask around a little bit. I got a 6.
Kim: Woo.
Rhi: Okay. You ask a couple people where Nevan is, and basically the second person you ask is like:
Rhi (as Scavenger): Oh yeah, I think he’s working on repairing some of the salvage.
Rhi: They point off towards one of the half-collapsed buildings.
Rhi (as Scavenger): Check in there.
Josie (as Minx): Oh. Thank you.
Rhi: The three of you make your way over to the building that was pointed out to you. This is like a half-collapsed house. Somehow in this ruined home a large table survived, and on this table is spread out a large number of mostly weapons in various states of disrepair, rusted blades, broken down guns, things like that. Sitting on a stool at this table, sorting through things, assessing weapons, is a young man, very dark skin, wearing pretty bulky clothes, has his hair cut very, very short, kind of gaunt in an underfed way, but even with all those differences you get one look at this guy and you’re like oh yeah, that’s Rigney’s brother. They have very similar facial structures and even hand movements. The way that he moves as he’s sorting through things, there’s something very familiar about it.
Kim: Aw.
Rhi: As you all approach, onto the edge of the table a creature leaps up, and Kim, I am going to let you describe it since this is kind of your baby.
Kim: So, this creature looks very similar to a domestic cat with a few exceptions. It has very large ears, and its hind legs are that of a regular cat, but its front legs are very long and spindly, and in between the joints there is some webbing. It has two pale, pupil-less eyes. It seems as though it gets very limited to no vision into it, but on the center of the cat’s forehead is a vertical eye that is bright, bright red up against this very dark, deep, rich purple fur, and it just pops out at you. The pupil is a rectangular bar going across horizontally almost that of a goat’s eye, and it is a very piercing gaze. Other than that, it behaves and moves and walks very much like a normal cat.
Rhi: Yeah. It pops up on the table and, true to cat form, bats a rusty knife off the edge.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Nevan looks up.
Rhi (as Nevan): Hex! Stop that—Oh, hi. Uh, are you…?
Josie (as Minx): Hello dear.
Minna (as Myra): Are you Nevan?
Rhi (as Nevan): Uh, yeah.
Josie (as Minx): I am Minx. This is Myra and Blaire. I’m uncertain if your brother mentioned us at all, but we are here on his behalf.
Kim (as Blaire): Rigney sent us.
Rhi (as Nevan): No, Caelan never… Oh. Are you The Magpies?
Minna (as Myra): Heh. That’s us.
Josie (as Minx): Oh! Our reputation precedes us.
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah. He mentioned a group that he’d been working with called The magpies. Didn’t give any names, I think just kind of a safety thing. He always spoke very highly of you, so… It’s great to meet you, but what are you doing here?
Kim (as Blaire): We came to get you out.
Josie (as Minx): yes. Cutting straight to the point, I see.
Kim (as Blaire): Things have changed in Duskwall. Rigney’s okay, but you can’t stay here in The Deathlands anymore.
Rhi (as Nevan): Uh… I mean, not complaining, I wouldn’t mind not being out here, but what’s going on?
Kim: Okay. Blaire’s going to step up and hand Rigney the note.
Rhi: Nevan. I mean, technically also Rigney. [laughs]
Josie: Oh. Rigney’s the last name. Right.
Rhi: yeah, Rigney’s his last name.
Kim: Oh! Wow.
Minna: Mm-hmm. Caelan Rigney.
Rhi: Yep. Caelan is his first name.
Kim: Anyway.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire hands over this note, which I assume Blaire did not read.
Kim: No.
Rhi: He unfolds it and reads it, and as he’s reading it his eyes go huge, and then he sets the letter down and rubs a hand over his forehead in a very, very familiar gesture. Rigney does the exact same thing when he’s frustrated or upset.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi (as Nevan): Why didn’t that tall idiot tell me? God!
Josie (as Minx): My thoughts exactly.
Rhi (as Nevan): [exasperated sigh] All right…
Kim (as Blaire): He was worried about something happening to you. He was worried about anyone getting hurt.
Rhi (as Nevan): I know. He always worries. He’s very good at it. Okay, so… with this, what’s the plan? I obviously can’t stay in Duskwall.
Kim (as Blaire): The plan is, we’re gonna get you over to Gaddoc Station and we’re going to get you to Tycheros. I have some family over there that will give you room and board and be happy to help you get back up on your feet.
Rhi (as Nevan): Okay, Tycheros, that’s a long trip.
Rhi: He reaches over and absently scratches at the cat’s head.
Josie (as Minx): Better safe than sorry.
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Rigney has things prepared for you, so it’s simply a matter of getting to the station, although if you need more humor tonics I might have some.
Rhi (as Nevan): Caelan probably has me. If he’s putting stuff together he’s probably got some set up, but I appreciate that. Okay, well, uh…
Kim (as Blaire): We figured it’s not safe for you to stay anywhere on Akoros. Tycheros is going to be the safest place for you right now.
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah. No, I understand, this is just not how I was expecting my day to go when I got up this morning.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Rhi (as Nevan): Okay! Let me get a few things together and talk to a couple people.
Kim (as Blaire): Can I pet your cat?
Rhi (as Nevan): Oh yeah, yeah. Hex, say hi to the nice ladies here.
Kim: Blaire is so delighted on the inside. She has never seen anything like this before.
Rhi: Yeah. He herds the cat across the table towards you.
Rhi (as Nevan): If you all could just wait here for a little bit, I’ll be just a few minutes.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah!
Minna (as Myra): Of course.
Rhi: He hurries off.
Kim: [meows]
Minna: [smiling] I love this voice.
Rhi: So yeah, Hex comes over and does the cat thing, shoves its head under your hand to demand pets.
Josie: Aww.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, you’re so cute!
Kim: Blaire’s gonna scratch behind the ears.
Rhi: It seems to like that.
Josie (as Minx): It is good to see something resembling a normal feline out here.
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean?
Rhi: It meows again, and Minx gets a good look at the mouth full of needle sharp, very long teeth.
Josie: Minx just sort of takes a half step back. [laughs]
Rhi: So, Blaire bonds with the cat, and Nevan comes jogging back with a pack slung over his shoulder.
Rhi (as Nevan): Okay. I told Lady Thorn that apparently I’m making a very hasty exit. I’ve got my stuff.
Rhi: He clicks his tongue and Hex comes over. He scoops the cat up and it does that thing where it drapes itself over his shoulders.
Kim: Ohh~!
Josie: Aww.
Minna: [hums happily]
Rhi (as Nevan): Okay… I think that’s it.
Josie (as Minx): Now it’s a nice, simple stroll to the train station.
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah. I don’t know. I just sort of always thought that leaving would be more of a production than this, but I’ve said my goodbyes and I got everything I’m taking.
Josie (as Minx): Don’t worry. There’s still plenty of time for a heartfelt goodbye as the train is about to leave.
Kim (as Blaire): And we’re gonna try and take the safest route out of here.
Rhi (as Nevan): I have been wandering around here for the last couple years, so pretty familiar with the quick routes around. Yeah, let’s get going.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: You start making your way out, past those guards again. As you’re passing by, he’s like:
Rhi (as Nevan): Good luck out here, Harry, Jaz. Be safe.
Rhi: Neither of them really respond. They’re both just kind of standing there, staring straight ahead.
Minna: Hnn…
Kim: Well, that’s their job.
Rhi: He kind of waves at them and they still don’t respond.
Josie (as Minx): That is not normal, is it?
Rhi (as Nevan): No… Oh.
Josie (as Minx): If so, they are very dedicated.
Rhi (as Nevan): Oh hell.
Minna (as Myra): What?
Rhi: His eyes shift as he’s clearly looking into the ghost field.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi (as Nevan): Sorry, I—
Minna (as Myra): Are they–?
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah. They got got. Hang on.
Rhi: He jogs back into the camp.
Rhi (as Nevan): Lady Thorn!
Rhi: Yeah, the consequence was those two ghosts followed you.
Kim: Nooo.
Josie: Ohh.
Minna: I thought that was weirdly easy.
Rhi: Mm-hmm! So, a few people from the camp come up and there’s some murmuring and waving of sigils around them, and then a couple people very carefully remove the guns, and the two women are ushered back into the camp. Someone pats Nevan on the shoulder.
Rhi (as Scavenger): Bad way to be heading out, but I’m glad that you caught it. Be safe out there.
Rhi: Nevan looks disturbed as you all head out.
Josie (as Minx): They’re gonna be all right, yes? Can we assist?
Rhi (as Nevan): Uh… We have a lot of experience with possession out here, so…
Minna (as Myra): [shivers]
Kim (as Blaire): They’ll find a way to remove the spirit.
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah, probably.
Minna (as Myra): You take this kind of thing in stride out here?
Rhi (as Nevan): Kinda have to. [sighs]
Rhi: The three of you set off. Nevan seems not shaken exactly, but a little ill at ease.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna walk up to him and touch his arm.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s okay. You won’t have to deal with that anymore, where you’re going.
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah. Yeah. What’s Tycheros like? I don’t really know much about it.
Kim (as Blaire): To be honest, it’s not that much different than Duskwall, but the people are much nicer. There’s a lot less crime and everybody’s willing to help out with each other. There’s a big focus on the arcane, and alchemy, and all kinds of magical research.
Minna (as Myra): You ought to fit right in.
Rhi (as Nevan): Well…
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t have to be a scholar to thrive there. Don’t worry.
Rhi (as Nevan): That’s good. I was gonna say the no crime part might be a struggle for me. Did Caelan tell you about what I did to land myself out here?
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): He did.
Rhi (as Nevan): I’m sure that I can manage to…
Kim (as Blaire): You’ll find reputable work. My aunt and uncle will get you squared away.
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah. It’ll probably be a little more boring, but eh, maybe I can do with boring. Boring actually sounds kind of nice.
Kim (as Blaire): I think Rigney would agree.
Rhi: The four of you make your way back through The Deathlands towards Duskwall. Between Nevan and Blaire, you’re both able to take safer paths and avoid any additional threats. You make your way into Nightmarket. You start to have a little trouble with Nevan here, because he’s basically not paying attention to where he’s walking because he’s looking around so much and has a running commentary on everything that’s changed.
Rhi (as Nevan): Oh wow. That clothing shop has expanded a whole bunch. Oh no, did that eel pie shop close? There used to be this great place that did these eel pies.
Minna: [laughs] I think Myra eventually grabs his elbow.
Minna (as Myra): Try to act a little bit less like an escaped prisoner who just got back to the city after exile.
Rhi (as Nevan): Right. Sorry. It’s my first time being in this particular situation. Yeah, got it.
Rhi: [smiling] He stops the commentary, but is still looking around a lot.
Kim: Right, which is fair so long as he’s not so vocal.
Rhi: What was the timing you gave Rigney? Be there before sundown?
Kim: Right.
Rhi: I think the last rays of weak sunlight are just starting to fade when you reach Gaddoc Rail Station, which is huge. It’s equivalent to Penn Station. This is just a huge station with many, many trains coming in carrying people and cargo at all hours of the day. I think you subsequently have a very specifically designated meeting spot for Rigney.
Kim: Yes, Platform 7 or whatever.
Rhi: Yeah. As the four of you approach you spot Rigney pretty easily, because he’s a tall guy, pacing back and forth, just looking extremely anxious.
Minna: [sad noises]
Rhi: As soon as you spot him, Nevan just goes…
Rhi (as Nevan): Caelan!
Rhi: …and breaks into a run and sprints over.
Others: [awing and happy sobbing]
Rhi: Rigney had been facing away from you. He spins on his heel and just stands there, frozen in shock, and then Nevan crashes into him in a hug.
Others: [simultaneously happy-groan]
Rhi: It’s a big, tight hug. They’re obviously talking while hugging, and Rigney is rocking him back and forth a little bit.
Minna: I’m gonna die…
Josie: Aw…
Rhi: They’re clearly talking. You can see Nevan wiping at his eyes a few times.
Kim: [long happy sobs]
Rhi: At one point in there, Nevan does punch Rigney in the arm as he seems to be chiding him for something, probably being a big, tall idiot who doesn’t tell anyone when he’s being blackmailed. [laughter] I’m gonna say, the platform you’re at is where the train that Nevan needs to be on is at. A bell starts ringing for boarding call. They step back and are clearly trying to wrangle their emotions.
Kim: Yeah…
Rhi: Rigney picks up a big duffle bag at his feet and hands it to Nevan, and Nevan starts to take it and then makes a very clear “hang on a second” gesture, and bends down and picks up Hex who’s been sitting at his feet this whole time and walks back over to the three of you.
Rhi (as Nevan): [clears throat] I can’t really give you much, and this is probably gonna cause you more problems than anything, but I can’t really take Hex with me… and um, well Caelan’s allergic.
Rhi: He holds the cat out to Blaire.
Rhi (as Nevan): Can you take care of him for me?
Kim: Blaire’s going to take him, but she’s going to look up at Nevan.
Kim (as Blaire): A-Are you sure?
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah. The felydon, they don’t really do too well outside of this area. I don’t want to drag him up to Tycheros and have him get sick or something. You know, when I come back we can maybe share custody or something.
Kim (as Blaire): Heh. Shared custody sounds good.
Kim: She’s scritching Hex’s chin as they’re talking.
Rhi: He reaches out and gives the cat a few pets.
Rhi (as Nevan): All right. You be good for these three, all right?
Kim (as Blaire): I’ll take the best care of him.
Rhi (as Nevan): Thanks. He’s been a real good friend out there.
Rhi: He gives the cat one last scritch.
Kim (as Blaire): When you get off the train you’re gonna wanna look for the Copper Sparrow Inn. It’s not far from the edge of the city where you’ll be landing. You’re gonna look for Gabriel and Sylvia Culhane. They’ll give you room and board. They’ll help you get back on your feet and find some work. Just don’t tell them that I sent you. I’m not ready to tell my family what I’ve been up to lately.
Rhi (as Nevan): Okay. I’ll just tell them a friend in Duskwall recommended them.
Kim (as Blaire): Take care of yourself out there.
Rhi (as Nevan): Thanks. Take care of yourselves in here, and keep an eye on my big brother, huh? He clearly needs it. He’s useless without me around.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ve always kept an eye on him.
Rhi (as Nevan): Thanks for this. I wish I could stick around and get to know you better.
Kim (as Blaire): There will be time.
Rhi (as Nevan): Yeah… Yeah. I’ll be back.
Rhi: He gives you all a wave and then walks back over to Rigney and they have another big hug.
Kim: [long sobs]
Minna: [whines]
Rhi: Nevan has to step back, and Rigney is clearly very reluctant to let go of the hug. But yeah, then Nevan picks up his bags and slings them over, looks around at the station, gives the three of you another wave, and then pats Rigney on the shoulder and turns and heads off towards the train. Rigney turns to watch him go until he gets on the train and disappears from site, and then turns back around. He’s pretty clearly having a hard time. His shoulders are slumped, hands shoved in his pockets, and as he gets close you can see his eyes are kind of red.
Kim: Can we talk to him?
Rhi: Yeah. He’s gonna come back over to the three of you.
Rhi (as Rigney): I know you’re still not thrilled with me, and that’s fine, but I can’t thank you enough for this, for what you did for the two of us.
Kim (as Blaire): Rigney…
Kim: Blaire’s gonna set Hex down before she, you know—
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Move in for a hug, and just let him know:
Kim (as Blaire): You’re being so hard on yourself. You’re gonna get past this.
Minna: Hnn!
Rhi: He doesn’t really respond, but he does hug you back… and then sneezes.
[chuckling]
Kim (as Blaire): Sorry.
Rhi (as Rigney): It’s okay. I managed to hold it together with Nevan. There’s cat fur all over him.
Kim (as Blaire): You gonna be okay? I know you didn’t get a lot of time.
Rhi (as Rigney): More time than I thought I was gonna get anytime soon. You know, maybe at some point I can take a vacation. I’ve never been to Tycheros. Go visit him sometime.
Kim (as Blaire): The Copper Sparrow would be happy to have you.
Rhi (as Rigney): I don’t really know what else to say besides just, thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re welcome.
Josie: Minx is notably a little bit back from Rigney.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: When Blaire steps back Myra’s gonna reach out for something that’s half way between a handshake and a hand clasp, just very reassuring.
Rhi: He gives Myra a nod, and then after a few moments takes his hand back.
Rhi (as Rigney): If you don’t mind, I need a little time.
Kim (as Blaire): Of course.
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Rigney): See you around.
Minna (as Myra): See you around.

## Blooper [1:22:29]
Minna: [sweetly] Oh, hello~
[small cat squeak]
Kim: [gasps]
Minna: [giggling] Did you hear that?
Kim: I did!
Josie: I heard that squeak!
Minna: My softest son~ He’s a big, big boy with a tiny meow sometimes.
Kim: That is sweet.
Rhi: That’s my favorite.
[small cat squeak]
Kim: Awww!
Rhi: I love that.
Minna: Yeah, you said that earlier and I was like “oh, it’s Raja.”
Josie: Oh no~!
Rhi: Oh, big chonker cats with teeny-tiny mews. It’s so good.
Minna: He’s just here to bother me. I think he wants water maybe, but he has water… so I don’t know what he’s doing.
Rhi: [chuckles]
Kim: He wants pets~
Minna: He’s getting them~"
"Season 2, Episode 14: The False Flag Score Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter)
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for listening. We’ve gotten a lot of new reviews in the last month, along with some really lovely emails from fans. We love hearing from our listeners, and leaving us reviews is a great way to help other people find the show.
If you’re going to Gen Con this August, Minna and I will be in attendance. I plan on spending most of my time playing new games and hanging out with friends, but you can see me and a bunch of other excellent podcast hosts on the panel, ‘So You Want to Start an AP Podcast’. It’s on Thursday at 11am, and we’ll be talking about all the ins and outs of starting your own actual play show. I’d love to see you there.
Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Josie: This week’s featured charity is The Sandy Hook Promise, the non-profit that builds at the community level to push for gun control legislation, provide mental health and wellness programs, and policy aid for victims of gun violence. That being said, gun control is something I’m very passionate about. The amount of gun violence in this country is disgusting. So, really, any charities, any fundraisers you can find in the wake of these disasters is part of this. I feature The Sandy Hook Promise because I like what they do and they’re fairly widespread. So, yeah. Stand up against gun violence this month.
Rhi: Please continue to reach out to your representatives and look for organisations you can support. Right now, I strongly recommend seeing what your local reproductive rights or voting rights groups need and how you can pitch in to help.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## Story continues [00.01.54]
Josie: As we’re passing over a bridge into that district, Minx is looking out the window and reminiscing about a time when her, Bazso and Nyryx were all wee children. Like, ten to twelve. And Minx is kind of balancing on, like, the stone railing of the bridge. And Nyryx is chastising her to get down, and Bazso’s the sort of kid who, kind of like, always fancied himself the leader anyway, so he’s strolling ahead with a stick in his hand or something like that. And, like, between that, Bazso and Nyryx are bouncing childish ideas off each other for what they need or who they’re gonna steal from next. And Minx just kind of goes along with whatever the most recent suggestion is, and gets really behind it.
Minna: Aww.
Josie: Like, she doesn’t wanna pick while she’s trying to maintain her balance up there.
Rhi: Yeah. So, the carriage that the three of you are in rattles to a stop as Minx, sort of, blinks out of this memory. And the three of you step out, up in the docks. The Cabbie waves at you as he heads off. Where do you think you have set up a meeting with Lani and Roxanne? Do you think you’re just meeting them at their apartment, or somewhere out in the district? We’ve kind of established you’re giving The Hound’s Paw a bit of a wide berth for the moment, so…
Kim: I personally would like to see their apartment.
Minna: I’d be down, if they would do business there.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, if they feel safe doing that, there’s potential for adorableness.
Kim: Yes. Exactly.
Rhi: So, yeah, you’ve been given their address, and they live in a pretty typical sort of apartment building that you would see in the docks. A little run down, a little shabby looking, you know. There’s some damage and stains on the walls, but it’s not a crumbling tenement like what you might see down in Dunslough. You head into their building, up the stairs; they live on the third floor, just enough that you’re all a little winded as you get to the top of the stairs. So you get to the door and there’s a doorbell button beside it. When somebody presses it, you can see, like, bright light flashing underneath the gap in the door a couple times. And then, after a few moments, the door opens and Lani greets you with a smile and a wave, and gestures for you to come in.
Josie: I’ll sign:
Josie (as Minx): Thank you for having us.
Josie: And enter.
Rhi: Yeah. So, Minx, you know a little bit of Imperial Sign, we’ve established, right?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay, but probably not enough to, like, carry on a full conversation.
Minx: No.
Minna: ‘Enough to flirt’ is, I believe, what we decided.
[laughter]
Josie: Yeah, exactly.
Kim: Enough to flirt and to swear.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. Lani kind of ushers you in. It’s a small studio apartment. It reminds you a lot of their old offices at the North Hook Mirror. A little crowded, lots of papers and books everywhere. There’s, like, a curtain hung up in one corner, that you can kind of see that it’s blocking off where they have their bed set up. And she guides you all over to the small table that’s in the little kitchenette area and signs:
Rhi (as Lani): If you want tea?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Thank you.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, please.
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, she seems to be, like, checking for each of you to nod.
Minna: Yeah, definitely Myra’s nodding.
Rhi: Yeah, and then she comes over with a tea kettle and pours everyone tea, and then sits down. I think she signs something. Minx, you can tell that it’s a question that she’s asking ‘What… something something’, but you don’t know enough to follow the whole thing.
Josie: I’ll sign back:
Josie (as Minx): I don’t quite understand.
Rhi: She nods and holds up a finger like, ‘Hold on a second’, goes and rummages around through some papers for a bit and then comes back with a stack of blank paper and a pen and sets that down in the middle of the table, and kind of mimes passing the paper back and forth.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So she starts off. Actually, before we get into this, so, this was the thing, I don’t know if you remember, on the Magpies Twitter a few months ago I was asking if I could consult with people who were D/deaf or hard of hearing.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I wanted to ask about this particular situation of how it would make sense for everybody to communicate if Roxanne wasn’t around. So, what I’m gonna wanna have us do for this part is basically you’re going to be passing notes back and forth with her. And just in order to, kind of, get the correct cadence, I guess, of it being written, before you say anything I do want you to actually, like, write it out and just read what you wrote.
Minna: By hand?
Rhi: Not by hand, you can just type it in the chat box.
Josie: Ah, gotcha.
Rhi: You don’t even have to send it, but just so that it’s kind of like–
Kim: Can I write it in my journal?
Rhi: Wherever you would like.
Kim: Yeah, okay.
Rhi: Um, yeah. Just so that it’s kind of like, just so we get the right feel for it.
Kim: Of course.
Rhi: That was one thing that a few people recommended.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, so:
Josie (as Minx): How are you doing? Is Roxanne alright?
Rhi: So, she writes back:
Rhi (as Lani): We’re well. She’s at work today. What did you need to talk to us about?
Kim: Okay, so Blaire finishes writing her note, and she asks:
Kim (as Blaire): We need some info on the members of The Circle of Flame.
Rhi: Lani writes back:
Rhi (as Lani): What kind of info? I know we have some names.
Josie (as Minx): We’re trying to complete the list of names.
Minna: So, I think Myra is currently writing down, like, a list. Like, she’s got a piece of paper and a pen and she’s concentrating.
Rhi: Okay, I think Lani will see that and just, kind of like, points at Myra and sits back to wait for that list to be completed.
Minna (as Myra): Here’s what we know. Lady Drake is affiliated, Lady Eleanor Penderyn is affiliated. There’s somebody whose name starts with R, who has underworld contacts. ‘R’ has a contact, ‘T.L.’ who provided Spirit Sight. We think Lord Mora might be, but we don’t know.
Rhi: So Lani takes the list and reads it, and her eyes get progressively wider. And she seems to, kind of, read through it a couple times, and then nods to herself, folds the paper up, goes over to, like, the kitchen and gets a small bowl and matchbook, and sets the paper in the bowl, lights a match and burns it.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And then writes on, you know, a scrap of paper:
Rhi (as Lani): Can’t be too careful.
Kim (as Blaire): Agreed.
Minna: Oh wait, wait, I have another detail.
Josie: [laughs] Don’t let the fire burn out.
Minna: I think Myra holds her finger up, pulls another piece of paper across and writes:
Minna (as Myra): ‘R’ paints.
Rhi: Tears off that section of paper, adds it to the fire, but she nods. [laughs] She’s very paranoid about this stuff.
Minna: No, good job. Myra approves.
Josie (as Minx): ‘Tis the only way to be sure.
Rhi: Yeah, she points at that note and nods vigorously. So then she writes:
Rhi (as Lani): We can look into the ones you suspect, try to get more names. What other info do you need?
Kim: I think that’s… that was it, wasn’t it?
Rhi: If you just want to start with, kind of, confirming your list.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): I believe that is it. The rest shall flow from there.
Rhi: So, she nods and then, kind of like, gathers up the papers that have been written on, and doesn’t light them on fire yet, but sets them over next to the bowl. And clearly she’s going to burn them after you leave. And yeah, I think that, kind of, as you all are finishing your tea you can pass notes back and forth. Just, sort of, more checking in, seeing how things are going. It’s not the easiest way to have a conversation, and I think there’s probably a couple times where Minx is able to sign some things to speed it up a little bit. But yeah, for the most part it’s just kind of passing notes. It seems like she and Roxanne are doing okay. Still kinda having a hard time finding work that is close to what they used to do. So they’re very grateful to have this sort of thing to do.
Josie: Right.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: What about Amancio? Does he need, like, a record keeper or something? No, Amancio.
Rhi: Maybe. You could ask next time you see him, yeah.
Josie: Because he’s a deal broker. Like, it’s not glamorous work, but it would be something she’s good at.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, next time you see him you could ask.
Josie: Well I was thinking that I essentially tell her about him right now.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Josie: And say it might be worth asking, especially if we say we referred you.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I think if you write that out, you give an address, Lani will kinda take that and look it over and nod sort of thoughtfully. And she will write out–, like, she sets that paper aside, out of her stuff to burn pile. It looks like she’s just gonna be burning the entire conversation that you’ve had. But that one she sets aside to look into later. And writes out:
Rhi (as Lani): Thank you. I’ll visit when I have a chance.
Josie: And Minx will nod.
Rhi: Yeah, is there anything else you wanted to ask, or look into there?
Josie: Quick question, what would it take to, like, become more fluent in Imperial Sign?
Rhi: I think that it would be a long-term project.
Josie: Okay. That might be a long-term project I start.
Rhi: Yeah. I don’t think you’d be able to get up to fluent, but I think with like, you know, a longer long-term project you could get up to conversational.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So yeah, that would be something you could do, it would just be a long-term project to work on that.
Josie: And I think Minx is gonna take a look at the burning pile of paper and make a really obvious, like, sigh of fainting, like my heart is wounded.
Rhi: Lani does a very, like, theatrical shrug in response.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So yeah, I think once you’ve all finished your tea she sees you all out and as you’re leaving signs:
Rhi (as Lani): Thanks for coming by, and good luck.
Josie: I’ll sign:
Josie (as Minx): Thank you, and good luck back.
Kim (as Blaire): Bye!
Kim: Blaire waves.
Minna: Same.
Rhi: Yeah. She waves as the three of you head off, and you make your way back down to the street. And I think as you get down to street level and are kinda looking around, figuring out where you’re going next, you see rounding a corner at the far end of the street a group of four Lampblacks, who look like they’re just on patrol. It’s just kind of that show of force thing that gangs do where they have people walk around to remind you that they’re there. They’re not really here looking for you three, they’re just around.
Josie: I’m going to turn and start window shopping.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Don’t make eye contact. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): [whistles badly]
Kim (as Blaire): Are you trying to whistle?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. I can’t quite do it.
Kim (as Blaire): Well why bother trying to whistle if you don’t know how to whistle?
Josie (as Minx): Well, practice makes perfect, dear.
Minna (as Myra): Practice makes perfect.
Josie and Minna: [laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. Yeah, but, I can already do it, like [whistles a tune]
Josie (as Minx): Well good for you, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): You just put your lips together and blow.
Rhi: So, the Lampblacks eventually turn down another corner and head off in a different direction than the three of you.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I believe our next order of business, because it has been a long time coming, is to plant a hand where the sun don’t shine.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs] Like in a butt?
Minna: [snorts with laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Yes, Blaire, that was the innuendo. That was the innuendo. I’m talking about setting up our friend here.
Kim (as Blaire): [giggles] It’s a good one.
Rhi: [laughs] My God.
Josie: I should be mad that she dissected the joke, but…
Kim (as Blaire): I dissect things, it’s a living.
Josie (as Minx): You are especially on brand today, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Minna (as Myra): And we all know how Minx loves branding.
Josie (as Minx): Quite.
Kim (as Blaire): Branding is consistency.
Josie (as Minx): I cannot wait for this war to be over so that we can make another brand push.
Kim (as Blaire): To where the sun don’t shine?
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): You know, I suppose I set you up for that one, and I should not be upset.
[laughter]
Rhi: So, what are the three of you doing towards the hand and the Lampblacks and other such things?
Josie: We’re gonna plant it in one of The Lampblacks’ holdings.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Thing is, we’ve gotta plant it somewhere reasonably secure, but also not take anything from that secure location, so as not to give the game away.
Rhi: Yep. So you know where their headquarters is.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yes.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, do you know if there’s a way to access some catacombs near under their headquarters in which to plant it?
Kim (as Blaire): You betcha.
Rhi: Yeah, you all do have those underground maps and such, still. I will also remind you, you all did meet a member of The Lampblacks. One of your contacts is Remira, a reluctant Lampblack, and they might be willing to provide some information.
Kim: That’s good.
Josie: I guess it’s just a matter of hoping that they are a very reluctant Lampblack.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Not merely discontent.
Rhi: Well, where do you wanna start?
Josie: I believe we need to pour over our maps.
Kim: Okay, so maybe maps first and then contact Remira second.
Josie: And someone besides me should do it, because I will be easily recognised.
Rhi: The problem is none of you are particularly unknowns at this point. Minx and Myra both are well–, because Myra, you know, has visited Bazso a few times, Minx obviously is well-known, and Blaire, even though she’s only been there once, is Tycherosi, and Tycherosi are uncommon enough. Yeah, you’re probably not gonna wanna show your faces around Lampblacks HQ too much.
Minna: They know us too well.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Honestly, I’m still not convinced that we need the help. If we study our maps thoroughly and proceed cautiously, we are likely to find a good location.
Rhi: Alright, well, let’s start with the maps.
Kim and Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Just gonna head back to The Nest?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Alright. So once again we find The Magpies in the common room of The Nest with a bunch of maps spread out over the table. I need an update on the other residents of The Nest; where is Kevin and what is he wearing?
Josie: Um… Kevin is around the planning table as well. Kevin is wearing a page cap and monocle.
Rhi: Excellent.
Kim: Very good.
Josie: Because he is studying as well.
Rhi: Good, good. And where is Hex? Where is our new cat?
Kim: Hex is on the top of the tallest bookshelf in the common area, and he is curled up on the top of that taking a nap. And his hind legs are just stretched out so you can see his little beans. And he is just curled up in a way that is so cosy.
Josie: Aww. His little purple beans.
Rhi: Excellent. Alright. Somebody wants to roll some kind of Gather Info here.
Kim: I’ll roll a Study. Ugh. Okay, so my highest was a 4.
Rhi: Okay. So you are looking for some kind of, like, catacombs that connect to Lampblacks headquarters?
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah, connect or go underneath, go nearby, anything like that.
Rhi: Okay. So, one of the underground canals goes right underneath.
Josie: Ooh, that’s perfect.
Rhi: And it looks like there… So what it used to be, was there was like a dock there, which when it was actually used as a coal warehouse, coal could be loaded out and shipped out to the river. So there is a dock down there that’s got access, but you’re not sure exactly what the layout of that space is. It’s a fair assumption that The Lampblacks are making use of that, if you’re got a, you know, pre-existing underground semi-hidden dock, you’re gonna use it.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: But you don’t know exactly what else is in that area besides, like, a dock.
Josie: Well, I think I know who to ask about that.
Kim: Mm.
Minna: [giggles]
Josie: The Gondoliers.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Gay! Gay! Gay! Gay!
Josie: [laughs] Unfortunately, this is business. And not gay business.
Rhi: Yeah, so if you wanna….
Josie: I would like to Consort with The Gondoliers a little bit and ask about what’s around that area.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I got a 6.
Kim: Woo.
Rhi: Okay. So, because you got a 6, the Gondolier you consort with is Kay.
Josie: Yay! Hey girl.
Kim: Hey girl, hey.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: Yeah, I think, like, you know there’s a few bars in the area that are kind of along the canals, where Gondoliers will grab a drink when they’re on a break, or coming off duty. So, you head in there to see who you can find, and Kay is there with a couple of her friends. Waves you over to the table, buys you a drink.
Rhi (as Kay): Wow, it’s been a while since I’ve seen you around. Not gotten shot again, have ya?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well… only once or twice.
Rhi: She just shakes her head.
Josie (as Minx): I heal quickly.
Rhi (as Kay): You better!
Josie (as Minx): Besides, it takes more than a gunshot to keep a good woman down.
Rhi (as Kay): Indeed.
Rhi: And she, like, you know, holds up her glass in a toast. Takes a drink.
Rhi (as Kay): So, what brings you here?
Josie (as Minx): Well, unfortunately business needs to get out of the way first. There’s a certain canal that I understand is no longer public beneath Crow’s Foot. And I was wondering if there were still records of what the layout of that is.
Rhi (as Kay): I mean, there’s a lot of docks that have come in and out of use. Can you be a little more specific about where?
Josie (as Minx): Uh… beneath the headquarters of The Lampblacks. [clears throat]
Rhi (as Kay): Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that’s not a public one, but it gets plenty of use. The Lampblacks send out from there pretty often. Yeah, it used to be part of a warehouse. It’s a pretty sizeable dock setup. It’s close to the river, so the canals are wider down there, they were able to get some barges in. Yeah, and on the dock is, you know, the old office where they would process payments and paperwork for the coal and everything.
Josie (as Minx): And I imagine there is catacomb access? It is an underground canal, after all.
Rhi (as Kay): If you go far enough, right that close to the district, no. You’d have to go down the canal a little ways to get to the catacombs. But, if you needed to make a hasty exit, it would be an option. Knowing you.
Josie (as Minx): I see. Yes, that does seem to be our specialty.
Rhi (as Kay): It is guarded, as well. They’ve got people posted up down there.
Josie (as Minx): I’d imagine so. I don’t suppose you’d be willing to go on this labyrinthine adventure? Or is it too risky?
Rhi: I think when you say it, like, she looked a little bit like, ‘Eh, I don’t know’, but then when you say it’s too risky, you have unintentionally poked her in the pride.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And so she kinda like straightens up a little and takes a big swig and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Of course I’ll take ya.
Kim: Yay!
Josie (as Minx): Good, I thought so.
Rhi: And one of her friends sitting next to her, just like, rolls his eyes really theatrically.
Kim: [sings] The power of queer.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: So yeah, you got a ride.
Josie [as Minx]: And now that the boring stuff is out of the way, I do believe we have some catching up to do.
Rhi (as Kay): Indeed we do.
Josie (as Minx): And some friends to meet.
Rhi: Yeah. So, after you’ve gotten that information, you have a nice night hanging out with Kay and her friends.
Kim: Do you get a smooch?
Josie: I dunno. Like, Minx is, I think part of Minx being more reckless is she’s more willing to get drunk and let her hair down a little bit.
Kim: And smooch.
Josie: Smooch, yeah, smooch. Yeah, Minx initiates.
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: Yeah, Kay’s open to it, if Minx goes for it, so.
Josie: Yeah, I think it is just smooching tonight. But smooching.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Woo.
Josie: Yeah. And Minx is still gone way longer than she quoted.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): So she’s probably having a good time.
Rhi: Myra. Do you wanna do any info gathering?
Minna: Hmm. I think I’m gonna try and get in contact with Remira.
Rhi: Okay. How do you wanna go about doing that?
Minna: Honestly, I’m going to lurk semi-anonymously around Lampblacks HQ.
Rhi: So just hanging around to catch Remira when they leave, basically?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. So this sounds like it could be Study, it could be Prowl. It could be Hunt, if you’re kind of trying to do a tracking sort of thing. You’ve got a few options for how you wanna approach this.
Minna: I mean, if you’re allowing Study… [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. You’re very intently watching one particular building, is my rationale there.
Minna: I’ve gotten a 5.
Rhi: Okay. So, you hang out outside Lampblacks HQ for a couple hours, but then you do eventually see Remira come out. However, they do not come out alone. They are with two other Lampblacks and it looks like they’re kinda going out on the same, sort of, patrol thing.
Minna: Hmm. See, here’s the thing. The level of stalking here might be wait around and kind of track this person’s movements until I figure out where they go when they’re off.
Rhi: So, I think that you follow this patrol group for a little bit, and there’s a point where the other two Lampblacks, like, the three of them stop outside of a bar. And they all kinda turn inwards, and you can’t quite see, but you can tell from the hand, arm, movements that they’re doing… what would the Duskwall version of Rock, Paper, Scissors be? Do you think it’d still be Rock, Paper, Scissors?
Minna: Uh…
Rhi: Probably.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: All of those things exist.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, so you can see that they’re throwing Rock, Paper, Scissors real quick, and then Remira kinda, like, their shoulders slump and one of them claps them on the arm, and the other two head inside. And it’s clear that, like, ‘Eh, we’re gonna take a quick break and go grab a drink, you stay out here and keep watch’. So, Remira is outside on the street, but alone for the moment.
Minna: Yeah, I’m gonna go ahead and go for it.
Minna (as Myra): Hello.
Rhi: Remina kinda looks over and like, squints at you a little bit. They’re clearly doing that thing of, like, ‘I recognise you, but I do not know from where’.
Kim: And damned if I know your name.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Minna: She holds out her hand.
Minna (as Myra): Myra Keel. The Magpies.
Rhi (as Remira): Oh, oh. Right. [hesitantly] Hi.
Rhi: They’ll shake your hand.
Rhi (as Remira): Wh… What did you need?
Minna (as Myra): I have a proposition for you. There’s money in it. Not much, but some.
Rhi (as Remira): Mm-hmm…
Minna (as Myra): We need a little help with the layout of The Lampblacks HQ. We won’t bring you into it.
Rhi (as Remira): [long sigh]
Rhi: They kinda glance back over their shoulder towards the bar. They’re like:
Rhi (as Remira): Um… I mean, I can tell you about the interior, where everything is.
Minna (as Myra): Do you have any access to some higher security areas? Or at least knowledge of where they would be?
Rhi (as Remira): Um, I mean, there’s Mr Baz’s office. Don’t get in there without permission. That’s up on the second floor. There’s the vaults, down in the old coal storage chutes.
Minna (as Myra): Below the lair?
Rhi (as Remira): Um, yeah. They’re big holes, basically, that I think they used to store coal in, that are underground. Those are locked up real tight.
Minna (as Myra): Those two seem like the most likely for what we’re looking for. What kind of security on them, do you know? Is it just guards, there are probably, I mean obviously, locks. Are there any kind of spark-craft or magical defences?
Rhi (as Remira): Both, as far as I know. The vaults in particular. Some start-up gang tried to break in during the war that they were having with the Red Sashes a while back. I wasn’t part of the gang back then, but yeah. Mr Baz got pretty paranoid about the vaults, and so added a lot of extra security.
Minna (as Myra): Seems about right.
Rhi (as Remira): Should I…
Minna (as Myra): Should you…?
Rhi (as Remira): Well, I’m just, I don’t want to know what you’re planning. I’m just wondering if I should maybe not be around when it happens?
Minna (as Myra): I’m not going to say that it’s gonna be completely safe to remain with The Lampblacks. But, in the immediate next few days, I can’t give you any predictable window of danger.
Rhi (as Remira): Okay.
Minna (as Myra): Just, things are gonna be getting hotter for the gang. Hopefully.
Rhi (as Remira): Right.
Minna (as Myra): Sorry to you, it’s nothing personal.
Rhi (as Remira): No, I understand. I just, you know, gotta pay the rent. You did say that there was money in this information.
Minna (as Myra): There is.
Minna: Out of character, what kind of money do you think is appropriate for this?
Rhi: One coin is a week’s wages. Yeah, one coin. Two if you’re feeling super generous.
Minna: I just have to take it out of my stash, so I think it’s… money’s tight enough that I can only afford a coin. But she does. She hands over a coin.
Minna (as Myra): I hope that’s enough to start to tide you over.
Rhi (as Remira): It’ll do.
Rhi: And they, like, tuck it away inside their jacket, and then are like:
Rhi (as Remira): You should probably get going. Those two were just heading inside for one drink.
Minna (as Myra): Well, you have a nice night. Thank you.
Rhi (as Remira): Yeah. Good luck, I think.
Rhi: So, I think we find you all back at The Nest having reconvened, I’m gonna say the morning after Minx’s night out on the town with The Gondoliers. I think you kinda were doing things that day, slash, that night. So, first question: How hungover is Minx?
Josie: Um… it’s not the worst she’s ever been.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Could be better.
Rhi: Yeah, so what are you all thinking in terms of plan here?
Josie: Well, it’s a sort of maze of canals under the whole district, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: So, I vote we try to go in an entrance that isn’t the one closest to The Lampblacks, and navigate over there.
Kim: It’s a possibility.
Rhi: So, Stealth plan probably, trying to sneak in, plant this thing, sneak out.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Definitely.
Rhi: You all are very good at the ‘sneak in’ part. It’s the sneaking out.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Right.
Rhi: You get in very quietly, you leave in a firey explosion. Okay. So, what are you all thinking for your loadout?
Kim: Light.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, same.
Rhi: Okay, so light load for everyone. Let’s do the engagement roll. So this will be a 2d6 engagement roll.
Kim: Okay.
Josie: Okey dokey.
Rhi: Okay. That’s a 5.
Josie: Neat.
Rhi: So, you meet up with Kay, I think later that night. She gets you through the canals without a problem, drops you off. There is, you know, walkways along the edge of the canal, so she drops you off there. You’re kind of closer to a catacombs entrance than to The Lampblacks’ dock, but you can see, like, the flickering light of where the dock is, looking down the canal. And so, your plan is to head into the catacombs and try and find a place nearby to plant it?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. You head into the catacombs and I think you have your maps of, kind of like, you have a map of Crow’s Foot above ground and then a map of below ground Crow’s Foot. You’re trying to line them up and make sure that you’re heading in the right direction, so you’re gonna end up underneath The Lampblacks’ warehouse. And you’re heading in the right direction, you’re feeling pretty good, you’re kind of starting to look around for maybe possible places you could, you know, set this up. Oh, before I get into this, who is carrying the arm?
Josie: I think–
Kim: Me.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: [laughs] Not sure why I asked. Probably could’ve guessed that.
[laughter]
Josie: Blaire has the spooky arm.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: God, we’re just carrying an arm. I keep forgetting.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s fine. Just wait until you find the–
Josie: It’s not a full arm, it’s just from the elbow forward.
Minna: It’s such a ghoulish plan.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s a forearm.
Rhi: Just wait until you find the real Hand of Kotar.
Kim (as Blaire): Ooh!
Minna: Oh.
Josie: Ugh.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): I’m excited for that.
Minna: I love the different inflections of ‘ugh’.
Rhi: You’re starting to look around for potential places where you could maybe set up your trap, where you could hide this away in a way that looks like The Lampblacks were the ones who planted it. And then you hear kind of a weird, unexpected sound. That of a pickaxe on stone.
Kim: Oh.
Josie: Huh. Do we see another light?
Rhi: If you stop and look around and kind of get your bearings, you can tell that the noise is coming from off to your left, and there is a little bit of light down there. And as you’re looking, you hear footsteps behind you, as if somebody else is coming up the passage. You’re in a risky position. You’ve got an opportunity to hide and there are, you know, you’re in the catacombs, there are a lot of nooks and crannies and places.
Josie: Okay. I think we just need to pull off into a side passage and turn out any lights we have.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah. What would that be? Prowl?
Rhi: Yeah. A group Prowl, to hide. If you wanted.
Minna: I only have 1, I can lead.
Josie: Okay.
Kim: Okay. I’m gonna push myself as well, I only have 1 dot in Prowl.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I got a 3.
Kim: Okay. 6.
Minna: I rolled a 3 too, so I take 2 points of Stress and we do well.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Minna: I love group Prowl rolls. It’s the best.
Kim: It’s the way to do it.
Rhi: You all duck into this dark side passage and put out your lanterns and are all pressed back against a wall. I’m picturing, since Myra was the one leading, that Myra has her arms out pushing the other two back against the wall into, like, the deepest shadows. You stand there and you can see a light getting closer and then a pair of figures in Lampblacks uniforms, or they don’t really have uniforms, but the standard Lampblacks get-up, walk past. One of them is carrying a lantern. They’re both carrying, like, one of them has a pickaxe, the other has a shovel. Which is weird.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: The Lampblacks do not have, really, much affiliation with mining directly anymore. You know, they were the old Lamplighters Guild; they never really did mining themselves. You kinda catch fragments of what they’re saying. One of them is grumbling about:
Rhi (as Lampblack): Of course the calculations would lead to a sealed-off chamber.
Rhi: And the other one is like:
Rhi (as second Lampblack): Well, it’s better than last time, where it was all the way out in The Deathlands.
Rhi: And the other kind of shudders theatrically. And they keep walking and turn in the direction of the pickaxe sound that you had heard.
Josie (as Minx): [whisper] Are they already looking for it?
Minna (as Myra): [whisper] Calculations…?
Kim (as Blaire): [whisper] Since when did The Lampblacks go into The Deathlands?
Rhi: They don’t? To the best of your knowledge.
Josie (as Minx): [whisper] What the hell?
Kim (as Blaire): [whisper] Yeah, that’s why I’m asking! Since when?
Josie (as Minx): [whisper] Do you think the rumour I spread got to them, and they think it’s actually underneath them?
Minna (as Myra): [amused whisper] There’s no way.
Minna: Can we… are they leaving?
Rhi: They’re heading deeper into the catacombs.
Minna: I really wanna know what’s happening!
Josie: Yeah. Like, is the way they’re heading more under The Lampblacks’ place?
Rhi: Kinda, yeah.
Josie: What the fuck.
Rhi: It’s more or less the direction that you were planning on going.
Josie: Oh no.
Josie (as Minx): [whisper] Well, if they’re already down here looking, they’re gonna find this. Which may be an asset to us?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah? I don’t know if we want Bazso to know.
Kim (as Blaire): [whisper] No, no of course we don’t want Bazso to know.
Josie (as Minx): Fuck.
Minna (as Myra): [whisper] I really wanna know what’s happening.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): [whisper] Well, we could split up?
Josie: Are we in a side passage?
Rhi: You basically ducked into sort of a little nook. It’s not really a full passage. It’s just kind of a little side area. The place where they’re at is kind of the direction you were planning to head in.
Josie: Mm-hmm. I think we might just need to head to a different portion of the catacombs.
Minna: Here’s the thing, speaking as a player. I just want to know things. I’m sorry. Curiosity is my flaw.
Josie: Yeah, I really want to know too, but, like, if we go forward with this, this will completely tank our plan, most likely.
Kim: Unless…
Rhi: Unless?
Kim: We split up the party.
Rhi: Go on…
Kim: That’s it, we split up the party. We break rule number one and split up the party.
Josie: Are you saying have someone else go off and hide the hand, and the others find out what the fuck’s going on?
Kim: Yeah, follow those folks while the others plant the hand.
Josie: Okay. Is it alright if I plant the hand?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm…
Kim: Blaire’s gonna, like, clutch the box.
Josie (as Minx): I’m just thinking that the one going off alone should be the one with a penchant for swords.
Minna (as Myra): Are you volunteering yourself?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, dear.
Minna (as Myra): Not a bad idea.
Josie (as Minx): Alright, here’s the plan, dears. You two will investigate this, I will find another passage to head down and plant the hand, and meet you back with Kay.
Minna (as Myra): Please be safe.
Josie (as Minx): I have an impeccable sense of caution.
[laughter]
Josie: Minx will smirk at herself as she heads off.
Kim (as Blaire): Be careful with that.
Josie (as Minx): I can be careful with precious objects, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. And come back.
Josie (as Minx): I will come back.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: Alright. Let’s follow Minx, I think, to start with. You’re gonna be walking in the catacombs for a while before there’s, like, a point where it turns so it’ll get underneath the Lampblacks’ headquarters again. And I think it’s actually gonna put you closer to the vaults, where you’re gonna be dropping it off.
Josie: Okay, yeah. Do I need to, like, check to not get lost, or to find something?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. Some kind of roll for either, like, if you’re sneaking, or if you’re kinda trying to keep an eye to keep your bearings…
Josie: Yeah. Is Survey applicable here? To like, keep my bearings and find something?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: I’m gonna push myself on this.
Rhi: Okay. It is risky, wandering around in the dark, alone, underneath Duskwall.
Kim: As one does.
Josie: I did get a 6 though.
Rhi: Okay, awesome. So, you make your way through the tunnels. Fortunately, you are able to keep your bearings pretty well. And you can kinda tell when you start getting close to the vaults, because you kinda start getting this, like, weird tingling feeling in your teeth, like when you get really close to the lightning barrier. It’s a similar feeling. And you turn the corner, and Remira was underselling the level of security that Bazso put on the vaults. Clearly he anticipated that people might try to blast their way through the underground part to get in. So there’s basically, like, there’s two, sort of, holes where they used to store coal. So, around each of the, sort of, the exterior of those, that go down through the catacombs, there is just this crackling wall of electricity. It’s like he’s built a miniature lightning wall down here. It’s not as bright, it’s not as strong, but it’s there.
Josie: So, like, the passage opens out onto one of these chutes, but it’s blocked by lightning?
Rhi: No, it doesn’t open into–, I’m trying to think how to describe this. So, the top of the chute is up in the warehouse. And then the chute goes down, and part of it goes through the catacombs, but it’s still, like, a solid wall. So, like, the tube goes through here. Does that make sense?
Josie: Uh-huh. And then around the tube is lightning?
Rhi: Yeah. And you can also see, like painted and carved into the rock are large arcane symbols and wards that you, both kind of just from growing up in Duskwall and particularly being around Blaire for the last year or so, you recognise as spirit bane wards. But also, proximity alarms, basically. If somebody gets close to those wards, it’ll set off an alert of some kind.
Josie (as Minx): Gods above, Bazso, when did you find the time?
Rhi: But, in addition to this whole setup there is, fairly close by, a small kind of side room. But it’s fairly close to this whole security setup. You’re not sure if it’ll trip the wards. You are a little worried about getting zapped by errant lightning, because this is not as well controlled as the lightning barriers. But, like, you do see a place where it would reasonably seem like this is a place where they might have stashed it.
Josie: [sighs] Okay. Um…
Rhi: So, I think we’re gonna, while you’re contemplating that–
Josie: Yeah, I will ponder.
Rhi: We’re gonna cut back over to Myra and Blaire. Are you two sneaking down after this weird mining expedition?
Kim: Yep.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Alright. So yeah, give me some kind of a sneakin’ roll.
Minna: Do you wanna do another group Prowl?
Kim: Yeah, I’m not gonna push myself, though. I’m getting pretty high on stress.
Minna: Uh, I’m trying decide whether I wanna push… I think I want to push myself, just because, I don’t know… What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Um, you know what, you are in catacombs. There’s a ghost down here that’s gonna notice you and probably cause trouble down the line.
Kim: Not if I can help it.
Minna: Yeah, I mean, I think that’s something that we can handle.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Alright.
Minna: And that’s a 6.
Kim: I rolled a 3.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I’ll take that one point of stress.
Rhi: The two of you sneak your way down this hall towards the light and peer into the room where this digging seems to be happening. There’s a small number of what look like Lampblacks down here, digging away at what looks like a deliberate, like, it’s not a solid wall, it’s not a collapsed ceiling, it looks like it’s something that was deliberately bricked over.
Kim: Huh.
Rhi: That they are trying to dig through. One of them is sitting off to the side with a book that they are kind of scribbling some notes in. And sitting beside them, on kind of a low stone shelf is a brightly polished silver pitcher. Myra, you recognise it, after a second, as previously you saw it in Bazso’s office.
Minna: Hmm.
Rhi: Blaire, you’re starting to put a few things together.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: This pitcher, the talk of going out into The Deathlands, and of specific calculations. This sounds like it has to do with the cult of a Forgotten God called The Empty Vessel.
Kim and Minna: Ahh.
Josie: Mm.
Rhi: This God’s, kind of, primary rite is a gathering of believers in a sacred place, you know, that can be out in The Deathlands, or at sea, or within the city.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, you’re kind of like, oh maybe they found a sacred place under here. So, that’s weird.
Kim (as Blaire): Super weird. Myra, I think I know what they’re doing.
Minna (as Myra): What is it?
Kim (as Blaire): I think they may have found an abandoned site of an old cult of a Forgotten God? It’s called The Empty Vessel.
Minna (as Myra): That is strange.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): But it does lend credence to our story.
Kim (as Blaire): It does.
Minna (as Myra): It’s always better to have more information than less. Let’s back off, though.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I think we’ve got all we need.
Rhi: The person who had the book, like, flips it shut and sets it aside and stands up and is like:
Rhi (as Lampblack): Hurry it up, you need to have that wall open by the time Bazso gets down here. He’s not gonna wanna wait on this ritual.
Kim (as Blaire): [whisper] Wait, woah, woah, woah, woah. Okay, so Bazso does know about this.
Minna (as Myra): Oh.
Kim (as Blaire): And they said ‘ritual’.
Minna (as Myra): [whisper] So Bazso’s in deep with this cult.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Myra, I think we should stick around for this.
Minna (as Myra): Are you sure?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. If we can get evidence that Bazso is doing a ritual for a cult, that’s big.
Minna (as Myra): On the one hand, I do like to have information, on the other this could get dangerous, if he’s down here. Are we ready to accept the risk?
Kim (as Blaire): Think about who you’re talking to.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, I was gonna say, I think that Blaire, this is sort of leaning into your Weird vice.
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Rhi: If you want to leave you’re gonna have to make a resistance roll, cause Blaire is just, like, this is so much her shit that it is going to be an active struggle where she’s gonna take stress in order to leave.
Kim: I, uh, nope. [laughs] Yeah, no, I’m not even gonna try to resist.
Minna: We can stay, I think she can, yeah, Myra can be convinced. Because, again, she likes to know things.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Sweet. Let’s break out the popcorn.
Rhi: I will say, like, the two of you are not in, like, a dedicated hiding place. You’re just kind of peering in from the hallway.
Minna: Yeah, let’s see if we can find a better hiding place. Can I roll, like, a Study or something?
Kim: Mm.
Rhi: Sure. Still gonna be risky.
Minna: Oh, damn. That’s a 3.
Rhi: Yeah, I think as you are looking around for a better hiding place, your foot hits a rock and it goes skittering across this hallway. And a few people in the room kinda turn and look back, and are going:
Rhi (as Lampblack): Wait, who’s other there? What was that?
Rhi: And they’re coming towards you with lanterns and are going to be upon you in moment, putting you in a desperate position.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh shit, oh shit!
Minna: Should I resist then?
Rhi: Up to you.
Kim: [sighs] I have an alternate idea.
Minna: What’s the alternate idea?
Kim: Uh, Rhi you mentioned that there was a ghost around here that could cause trouble?
Rhi: It has not appeared yet.
Kim: Although, I could put on my spirit mask, look into the ghost field, locate them and try to Command them.
Rhi: It’s gonna be desperate.
Kim: What about a Devil’s Bargain along with that?
Rhi: No matter what you roll, you’re gonna get the attention of a ghost.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Okay. This is desperate, just bear that in mind.
Kim: I’ll roll Attune first, just to look into the ghost field.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: That’s a 5, baby.
Rhi: Okay, so Blaire quickly puts on her spirit mask and looks into the ghost field. And you turn around just in time to see a ghost. It kind of has lost most distinguishing features and it has that kind of gaunt look of a ghost that has not fed well.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And it’s gonna lunge at you and possess you. That’s level 3 harm.
Kim: No, no, I’m resisting that.
Rhi: Yep. You do get a bonus on your resistance for your Iron Will.
Kim: 2, 3, 4 and an extra for Iron Will. That’s 5 dice, my dude.
Rhi: Alright.
Kim: Oh Christ. Uh, my highest was a 3?
Rhi: Okay. So you’ll take 3 stress.
Kim: That taps me out on stress. Do I take a trauma?
Rhi: Uh, yes.
Kim: Uh, what the fuck?
Josie: Oh shit.
Kim: [laughs] What the fuck?!
Rhi: For what it’s worth, you also take a trauma if you get possessed. Myra, you see Blaire look into the ghost field. She gasps. The area around you gets extremely cold for a second, and then Blaire passes out. She just collapses at your feet.
Minna: Um.
Rhi: So Blaire’s gonna be unconscious for the rest of the scene. You still have people coming towards you.
Minna: And I have to get her out of here with me.
Rhi: Yep. And we’re gonna cut back over to Minx.
Josie: Uh-huh. And I am coming back with a weird question.
Rhi: Yeah?
Josie: In this setting, are boots primarily soled with rubbed or leather soles?
Rhi: I think rubber exists. I do not think that it is so common that it’s gonna be–, like, you could get rubber soled shoes, but they’re very expensive and it’s pretty much only the Sparkwrights that have them. So yours are probably leather.
Josie: Gotcha. This is fine. If they’re leather, that means they’re very conductive. So what Minx is gonna do is take some time to step out of and unlace her knee-high laced black leather boots that she wears on jobs.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: She’s shedding a tear as she does this?
Josie: Yes. So what she’s gonna do is try to, from a distance, like, push them gently. So they’re just slightly ahead of where she’s gonna go.
Rhi: Okay. So they’ll start getting zapped when she knows…
Josie: Right. If the lightning starts jumping out, they’re gonna go for the boots first, because they’re closer and highly conductive.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. That’s ingenious.
Minna: I love using physics to solve a problem.
Josie: Physics!
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: And then Minx is gonna try and keep close to the wall, padding along in her stockings, and turn around into the passage off to the side.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, I think–
Josie: Do I need to make a roll about that?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: It’s gonna be… hmm.
Josie: I could see Prowl, or Finesse, or Skirmish.
Rhi: I think Prowl or Finesse. And I am gonna give you increased effect. You’re gonna be at greater effect, because that’s just so fucking brilliant. [laughs]
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: You have impressed the GM!
Josie: [laughs] What does a Devil’s Bargain look like here?
Rhi: Your boots are gonna be destroyed.
Josie: Okay. Minx will shed tears about it, but will accept this bargain.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: So she’s gonna be padding along silently crying.
Rhi: [laughs] Yes, those were probably not cheap.
Josie: Nope. Okay, I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. So that would have been risky, but with greater effect. God, what are you using to, like, what do you have to push the boots along?
Josie: Uh, well… no, she can use her cane. Because wood isn’t very conductive either and I imagine it’s wood on the outside?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: So she’s gonna sort of poke at them with her cane until they’re close enough.
Rhi: Yeah, so you poke them forward and then it seems to be going fine, nothing’s happening, nothing’s happening. And then this huge arc of lightning just cracks out and slams into the boots, and there’s like a blackened spot on the floor and there’s the pleasant aroma of burning leather in the air as your boots are just disintegrating before your eyes.
Josie (as Minx): I’ll miss you, dears.
Rhi: [laughs] But you’re gotten very close to the entrance to this little side room. And so, you’re able to duck in there. It looks like this may have been some sort of small chapel. There’s a little altar towards the back of the room, and then some kind of, like, you know, catacomb shelves along the sides.
Josie: Okay. Can I hide the box containing the hand, like, behind the altar?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: You know what, I’m gonna make a Survey roll to see if there are any already existing hidden compartments.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. That’s a good call.
Josie: No.
Rhi: Oh, yeah, okay.
Josie: So behind the altar it is.
Rhi: Yeah, I think that that was, since in this position it’s controlled, if you wanna hide it you’d have to try a different approach, or you can just be like, ‘Well, I will just set it down on the ground back here’.
Josie: I mean, I might as well roll something.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I’ll roll Prowl to, like, stash it behind there in such a way that no one’s likely to look behind there, even if it’s not especially well hidden.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Ehh, 3.
Rhi: [amused] Okay.
Josie: So it’s there.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, it’s, yeah. You get a little more caught up in the presentation of it than necessarily hiding it. [laughs]
Josie: Yes. And, you know, I’m distracted because I’m in a creepy underground chapel and my boots are gone.
Rhi: Yeah, your boots are burning outside. Yeah, so I think that you do manage to get it hidden back there, or at least placed back there pretty well. And yeah, I think if you’re satisfied with your work, you can start making your cautious way back in your stocking-ed feet.
Josie: Yeah. I’m gonna start making my way back on my tip-toes, because it’s cold.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Well, and there’s like, bits of rock and stuff.
Josie: Yeah. And now, are my boots fucking gone? Or are they still, like, intact enough to count as leaving evidence?
Rhi: Huh… let me do a fortune roll to see how well your boots have held up. They’re gone. [laughs]
Josie: Okay, so I don’t need to worry about it.
Rhi: Yeah, they have burned. Like, it’s clear that something burned up there.
Josie: Mm-hmm. But as far as he’s concerned, the security system did its job.
Rhi: Yeah, Bazso would not be able to look at that and be like, ‘Son of a bitch, it was Minx. I’d know those boots anywhere!’ [laughs]
Josie: So, I’m gonna head back to Kay.
Rhi: Okay. Alright, so Minx begins tiptoeing away, having completed her part of the mission pretty flawlessly, sacrificing only some boots. Meanwhile, Myra.
Minna: Are there people looking at me, basically?
Rhi: Um, they’re about to be.
Minna: If I do some quick thinking, do you think I can bluff them that I wanna join their cult?
Rhi: You can try. You can try anything. That’s the beauty of an RPG.
Minna: I know. I’m trying to think if that’s my best plot here. I do have an unconscious friend, but that kind of only strengthens the idea that we came down here looking for some spooky shit and just ran into trouble. The thing is that I do have my unconscious friend, so I don’t think I can just pick up and run, because I don’t know if I can even carry her.
Kim: I am small and light.
Josie: Yeah, Blaire’s a smol.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, like, you would be able to pick her up and carry her. You would not be able to pick her up and sprint with her.
Minna: Exactly. I’m gonna try a Prowl. But I’m not gonna push myself for it.
Rhi: Okay, carrying Blaire?
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay, you’re gonna be at reduced effect for Blaire’s weight.
Minna: Oh, that’s actually a 5.
Rhi: This is desperate, though. So mark XP.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: Okay. So, you do it but there’s a consequence. [sighs] Oh man. Do I wanna be that mean?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Okay!
Minna and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: I would like to point out to all listening, Minna asked for this.
Minna: Listen, we have established my masochism in this game! For Twitter and the world.
Rhi: Myra, you shrink back into the shadows and scoop Blaire up and get to your feet, and you make it, like, halfway down the hall when Bazso and his entourage turn the corner.
Kim: [groans]
Josie: Oh, shit!
Rhi: Serious complication. You’re pretty much…
Kim: Fucked.
Rhi: Stuck. [laughs] Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Bazso!
Minna: He’s gonna see me anyway.
Rhi: Yeah. He stops dead. [laughs] And, like, there’s a solid three seconds of just bewildered staring.
Josie and Minna: [laugh]
Rhi: Because you’re standing in the tunnels underneath his base holding an unconscious person. And he’s just:
Rhi (as Bazso): What the fuck are you doing here?
Minna (as Myra): My friend got wind of something strange happening, and she’s a little too interested in what’s strange for her own good, and I thought I could stop her. She ran into trouble before I got to her. I just wanna get her out of here. Can you help me?
Rhi: Make a roll.
Minna: I guess that’s a Sway, which is sad–
Rhi: It is absolutely a Sway.
Minna: Because I’m not as good at Sway.
Josie: It’s not that wrong, though. It’s just not the whole truth. [giggles]
Minna: I am going to push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Oh no, it’s a 3. [laughs]
Kim: Fuck! Ooh, boy.
Minna: I so wanted to be able to pull that off.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: This war is going to be on forever.
Rhi: Oh, man.
Minna: We’re gonna jump from one war to another war.
Rhi: Or two at once.
Minna: [cringes]
Rhi: I mean… shit.
Kim: Yes, exactly.
Minna: Oh God.
Rhi: Yeah, Bazso just stares at the two of you for another long few seconds, and then just, you hear footsteps behind you as the people who were working back in that cavern come up. And he is just like:
Rhi (as Bazso): Right. I don’t have time to deal with you right now. We’ll figure out the real reason you’re creeping around underneath my base later.
Rhi: And he gestures behind him and the four armed Lampblacks who are with him come up. Two of them take Blaire away from you–
Kim: No!
Rhi: The other two basically, like, you know, have your arms pinned, pad you down for weapons, and then they are marching the two of you out through the catacombs. Somewhere else. And Bazso kinda calls over his shoulder, like:
Rhi (as Bazso): Make sure that they’re secure and look around for Minx. If the two of them are here, I’m sure she’s prowling around somewhere as well.
Rhi: And yeah. So, you’ve been caught and captured at the moment. However, Minx is prowling around somewhere. And I think, Minx, as you kind of come into the sort of main hall, you see ahead of you four Lampblacks with, you know, basically kind of marching Myra along, holding an unconscious figure in their arms as they are heading out through the catacombs.
Minna: Don’t be a hero.
Kim: Please be a hero.
Josie: Minx is gonna pull her hands to her lips to stifle a gasp. How many are there?
Rhi: Four.
Josie: Four. Including Bazso?
Rhi: No. Bazso went off to do whatever this ritual was.
Kim: And I wanted to see it so bad.
Josie: Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Rhi: But yeah, it’s four heavily armed members of the Lampblacks.
Josie: We’ve established that if I want a smoke bomb as an unusual weapon I have to do a flashback about it?
Rhi: Yeah, point of stress.
Josie: [hesitates] Yes, it’s gonna be smoke bomb time.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: Yeah. So she’s gonna gasp, but then as soon as they’re passing where she is, she’s just gonna whip a smoke bomb right out into the middle of them.
Rhi: Okay. For you it’ll be risky, because they don’t know you’re there.
Josie: 5.
Rhi: So, you throw the smoke bomb. It lands in the middle of them, goes off perfectly, smoke starts filling the tunnel. The one who kind of has his hands free, because two of them are holding Myra, one of them is holding Blaire, goes:
Rhi (as Lampblack): Ah dammit, she’s here!
Rhi: And, like, swings wildly with a truncheon, and somehow that wild swing just cracks you upside the head. So you’re going to take level 2 harm.
Josie: I’m going to resist that.
Rhi: Okay, that’s gonna be Prowess.
Josie: Critical.
Rhi: Okay. So, I don’t know if this has happened yet. When you roll a critical on a resistance roll, not only do you take no stress, you actually heal a point of stress!
Kim: What the fuck?
Josie: Woah! [laughs]
Rhi: You get to reduce your stress by 1.
Josie: Neat! Basically, I’m feeling cool and manoeuvrable and stuff.
Rhi: Oh God, I have this super cool mental image. So, he swings at you and like, you throw your arm up and catch the truncheon and yank it out of his hand.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Yeaaaaah!
Rhi: Which is probably more than a resistance roll should do, but whatever! It’s cool.
Josie: Yeah. And I’m just gonna say:
Josie (as Minx): Myra, grab her.
Minna: Yeah, Myra immediately reacts.
Rhi: Well Myra, you’re still being held by two people.
Minna: Hmm.
Rhi: So.
Josie: Although they are blinded and coughing in smoke.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: So, now might be the time to try and break free.
Rhi: And I will say, since you got searched for weapons, you can have any kind of gear you want on you, so long as it is not a weapon. Because even though you hadn’t established, sort of, having weapons in the Schrödinger’s supplies, any weapons you would have had on you have been removed.
Minna: Okay, so I rolled a Skirmish just to see what happened and I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I’m trying to think what it looks like. It’s one of those, like, stomp the instep, hope they get distracted enough by the pain to loosen their grip and, like, wriggle out, type things.
Rhi: So, I think what happens, because there’s two guys holding you. You do that, and one of them lets go of you, because you stomp on that one guy and he’s already coughing from the smoke and that just sort of makes him lose his grip entirely as he stumbles against the wall. But the other guy still has a hold on you.
Minna (as Myra): Take her, Minx!
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: [laughs] Both of you yelling at each other to save Blaire.
Josie: Yes, I will attempt to seize Blaire with my free arm. I think I’m gonna make it a Wreck. I think I just wanna fucking truncheon that guy in the face and grab her.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Like, I mean, okay, actually Skirmish is a better roll for me.
Minna: You can still be vicious.
Rhi: The penalties for screwing up a Wreck roll while trying to extract an unconscious person from somebody’s arms are gonna be a lot higher. You could really hurt Blaire.
Josie: Okay. Yeah. I’m gonna swing the truncheon I just grabbed around into that guy and try to grab her.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: 6.
Rhi: Okay, so with a 6, yeah, you basically do what that first guy was trying to do to you. You crack this guy in the head and yeah, I think he drops Blaire. And you are able to scoop her up.
Josie: Scoop up the bab.
Minna (as Myra): Take her and run!
Josie: Yeah. I’m gonna throw her other my shoulder like a sack of potatoes and fucking bolt.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, you can do that. Myra, you are still being held by a person. You’re basically there, like, all four of them are still conscious. So, I think now, Myra, you are back in a desperate position, because you’re so severely outnumbered.
Minna: Okay, I rolled a 5.
Rhi: Okay. To escape again?
Minna: Uh, yes.
Rhi: Was that on a Skirmish?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. Tell me what you’re doing, how are you?
Minna: I assume it’s not much time, so like, she’s shaking this one guy off, yelled, ‘Minx grab the friend’, and then she’s gonna turn and punch this guy in, like, I dunno if the face is the right thing.
Rhi: Go for it, you could do, like, the jab.
Minna: Yeah, like a throat jab maybe?
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah, because that’ll ruin somebody’s day.
Minna: The soft spot. [laughs] Phin told her to go for the soft spots.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: And also how not to break her thumb.
Rhi: You jab the other guy in the throat, he lets go. You start running. Um, I actually haven’t triggered your ghost, have I?
Minna: Hmm?
Rhi: [laughs] Well, the ghost that showed up, that Blaire was looking for, was just her rolling badly. The ghost from your Devil’s Bargain hasn’t actually turned up yet.
Josie: [stammers]
Minna: Ooh?
Rhi: And this seems like a really nice time for a ghost to show up.
Minna: It does.
Rhi: As you’re sprinting away, the air gets really cold again. I think it’s actually the same ghost, cause Blaire did manage to fight it off. And it’s still hungry. Yeah, then I think this ghost is gonna try and possess you.
Kim: Fuck.
Rhi: So, you can roll to resist.
Minna: Okay. I rolled a 5.
Rhi: Then you’ll only take 1 point of stress.
Minna: Which means I don’t actually take trauma.
Rhi: Cool. So tell me how you fight it off.
Minna: Can we, like, roleplay with the ghost?
Rhi: Yeah!
Kim: Yeah, fuck yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, absolutely.
Kim: Do it for me.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: So, the ghost starts trying to get into her, I think that’s where this picks up.
Rhi: Yeah, and it is very much a feral ghost. It’s not really capable of a lot of coherent speech. You get very cold and this thing is screeching in your mind as it’s trying to take you over.
Minna: It’s screeching in her mind and she feels a hunger that goes deeper than her stomach, deeper than her bones. But it is not her hunger, and she knows this. She gathers every bit of strength in her, and channels it all into one word. And that word is ‘No’.
Rhi: And I think the ghost continues to screech, but it goes from being sort of a screech of hunger and triumph to a rising screech of frustration as it’s repelled from Myra, who keeps sprinting.
Minna: I think Myra is, like, screaming that ‘no’ louder and louder and louder in her head as it gets stronger.
Rhi: I think we cut back to where Kay is, who sees Minx running with Blaire over her shoulder and is just like:
Rhi (as Kay): Oh, shit.
Rhi: And, you know, scrambles out of the gondola and goes to help Minx with Blaire, and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Is she okay? Is she alive?
Josie (as Minx): She will be fine.
Rhi: She’s like, you know, checking for Blaire’s pulse, and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Where’s Myra?
Rhi: And then I think at that point–
Josie (as Minx): Should be right behind us.
Rhi: Yeah, I think at that point, yeah, more or less, Myra comes tearing out of the catacombs and running towards you.
Minna: Wild-eyed, mussed.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, looking…
Minna: Like hell.
Rhi: Way, yeah, very badly freaked out. I think Kay, like, stands up in the gondola and just kind of, it’s a thing where she just grabs Myra by the arm and uses Myra’s momentum to basically throw her into the gondola. And then immediately, she’s not even asking questions, is just like:
Rhi (as Kay): Yep, it’s time to go.
Rhi: Starts pulling away. And I think as she’s going, from behind, back at the catacomb entrance, Minx looks back and there’s a couple of the Lampblacks and Bazso, and they fire a couple shots at you. But, you know, at this point you’re too far away, the shadows are sort of throwing things off, so none of the shots hit. Unfortunately, Bazso knows that the three of you were here.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: But it was on the night of his super-secret ritual.
Rhi: So, yeah, it’s possible he thinks that you were coming down here to mess with that. Kay hastily gets the gondola down through the canal, and I think after a few minutes Blaire comes to.
Josie: I think Minx is kind of sitting silently in the other end of the boat. Because Myra just got thrown down into the bottom of the boat and is clearly, like, freaked out, and didn’t gain trauma but is clearly traumatised. I’m accurate in saying that we’ve never seen Myra anywhere near this close to out of control before?
Minna: Yeah, that’s probably true.
Josie: And, like–
Minna: I mean, we’ve had other ghost moments, but I think this is the closest she’s come to being possessed.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: Besides that time that she did it on purpose and in a very controlled way.
Josie: And, like, Minx is just gonna be silently crying a little bit in the other end of the boat.
Minna: Oh my God.
Josie: Because she separated from them and they both got really hurt.
Minna: And I think Myra is actually, she’s trying to, like, push down her own freaked-outness and is pushing Blaire’s hair out of her face and trying to wake her and tend to her.
Kim: Aww.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire? Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): [mumbles]
Minna (as Myra): Oh, thank God, you’re alive.
Kim (as Blaire): [stammering] What happened? Did we see the ritual?
Minna (as Myra): We didn’t see the ritual. There was a spirit. A very hungry spirit.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, it went right through me.
Minna (as Myra): Tried to make lunch of me, too.
Kim (as Blaire): But, you’re good? You got away?
Minna (as Myra): I’m good. I’m whole, and I’m me.
Josie (as Minx): Both of you, I’m so sorry.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx? What happened?
Josie (as Minx): I’m so, so sorry.
Minna (as Myra): We took the risk. We made the choice.
Kim (as Blaire): But don’t be sorry. You did the thing.
Josie (as Minx): I don’t know what would happen if anything happened to you two. And we came so close today.
Kim (as Blaire): [mumbling] Well, now you know to… we felt when you pulled that shit in the tunnel… in the bane.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] You should rest.
Kim (as Blaire): No…
Rhi (as Kay): She’s right.
Rhi: Kay says, and kind of reaches back.
Kim (as Blaire): But, but…
Rhi: If Blaire is trying to sit up, she’s going to, like, push Blaire back down and be like:
Rhi (as Kay): Nope.
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, no, I can…
Josie (as Minx): [shushes Blaire]
Rhi (as Kay): Where’s that doctor friend of yours that you’ve mentioned?
Kim (as Blaire): I gotta be awake, though. What if– [mumbles as the others talk]
Rhi (as Kay): River? Or Seeks, or something?
Minna (as Myra): Seeks. The River Lost But Seeking.
Rhi (as Kay): Yeah, where is she at?
Kim (as Blaire): If the ghost comes back, I gotta… ready, and–
Josie (as Minx): It won’t.
Minna (as Myra): The ghost won’t come back. It’s back there, with plenty of easier meals.
Kim (as Blaire): There’s… another ghost… might… I got jars and stuff.
Minna (as Myra): Give them to me, I’ll protect you for a little bit.
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, no, no, no. No. No, no. I jar ‘em up.
Josie (as Minx): We’re done with spirits for today.
Kim (as Blaire): What… what if they’re not done with us?
Josie (as Minx): Then we’ll handle it.
Kim (as Blaire): But… not…
Rhi (as Kay): I am perfectly capable of fending off some ghosts. I have spent enough time in these canals to be able to deal with them.
Kim (as Blaire): But I handle this!
Josie (as Minx): Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): I handle this.
Josie (as Minx): It’s alright to rely on us once in a while. Please, just rest.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: I think that we kind of pull out as Kay continues to head South through Crow’s Foot, down towards where Seeks is. Alright, so let’s get into downtime. Who wants to go first?
Josie: I have an idea.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I think I want to meet Nyryx as she’s getting off work.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I’m gonna be dressed up pretty fancy this time. Like, not for fast movement at all. And gonna take my time strolling over there, wondering at being able to wander the streets without looking over my shoulder every two seconds. And yeah, I’m gonna ahead of time make reservations at a fancy restaurant.
Rhi: Oh, okay. I think it’s like, she is leaving work, probably at like… it’s still fairly late in the evening, probably eight or nine o’clock, but yeah. It’s not like three or four am. You see the doors open and she comes outside and is wearing, you know, a nice coat, and has her hair just sort of pulled back very simply. She says goodnight to the guards out front and then starts down the stairs and kind of, like, stops halfway down when she sees you and just does a double take. And then recovers from the surprise and finishes coming down and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Minx, hi!
Josie (as Minx): Evening, Nyry. I was just wondering if perhaps you would fancy a dinner tonight? I know it’s a bit spur of the moment.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh, um… yeah, actually, this is the best thing that’s happened to me all day.
Rhi: And she just kinda like rubs her forehead and, like, now that’s she’s closer you can tell that she looks, not tired, but just kind of like, a little irritated.
Josie (as Minx): Then to sweeten the deal, it will be my treat.
Josie: And I’m gonna proffer my arm for her to put through it.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, she takes your arm, is just like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Ugh, you have no idea how much I needed this. Things have been [sigh] just really frustrating lately. Tesslyn hasn’t been around as much, I don’t know what she’s doing, but she’s left a lot of the running of the place to her assistant, who… I’m sure has some redeeming qualities, but those redeeming qualities do not include the ability to manage a schedule. We’ve had people–, I was double booked twice tonight. And people do not respond well to being told that their preferred partner is not available, and fortunately I didn’t have to deal with most of the direct frustrations, the poor girl working the front desk had to deal with everyone.
Josie: As she’s ramping up in her explanations I’m gonna pull her a little bit closer.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. She’s just like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): It’s just, it’s very irritating and I have no idea what Tesslyn is up to that’s taking her away from running her establishment for so long. It’s just, I dunno. It was just a long, frustrating day and I’m very glad that you picked today for this surprise. It’s much needed.
Josie (as Minx): It’s no trouble, and you deserve better than that.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [sighs] Well, I’m hoping it’s just temporary.
Josie (as Minx): These things do tend to pass.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yes. If nothing else, if enough of us get together and complain about the scheduling I’m sure it’ll get taken care of, but…
Josie (as Minx): Well, be careful. If you do that, you might end up running the place.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Ugh!
Rhi: She, like, waves a hand, as if batting your words away.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Don’t say that! Ugh, no, no. No interest in management. You have no idea the kind of drama that can come up in a place like this.
Josie (as Minx): I think I have some idea.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I will tell you all about it over dinner.
Rhi: And I think she, like, starts going into all of the detailed back story of this feud between two of her colleagues as you head off to this restaurant.
Josie: And Minx is going to spend tonight listening, mostly.
Rhi: Aww.
Josie: Just kind of taking the stress off Nyryx, for once.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire, or Myra? Do either of you have idea for what you wanna do for scenes?
Kim: Was thinking that Blaire would want to write a letter to Lord Scurlock, to just let them know that, you know, we did the thing, thank you for giving us the artefact once again.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: She’s not writing the letter proper, she’s just sitting in bed drafting it in her journal. And it’s like, lots of torn up pages, lots of ink scribbles, being very unsure of herself the whole time.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah I like that. And like, I can see where she starts writing it where it’s almost like a journal entry, where she’s, like, telling a lot more detail than she should and then it just like, ‘Oh no I can’t write this down’, and tearing out the pages and tearing them up because what if somebody sees this?
Kim: Exactly.
Rhi: Yeah. Aww, so it’s just Blaire in her bed surrounded by all these torn up, ink-stained pages.
Kim: Yeah, ink-stained fingers, very frazzled.
Rhi: Yeah. Poor kiddo.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Do you think she’s able to finish a draft of the letter at this point, or is it–
Kim: Maybe one extremely rough draft. And then goes to sleep. [giggles]
Minna: Aww, baby.
Rhi: Okay. Poor Blaire. Myra? What do you think?
Minna: Myra’s also dealing with the aftermath of being upset. I think her stress relief, she is not doing the Devil’s Tooth, she’s doing the obligation. Because she kinda just wants something steady and comforting. And, like, there’s been a lot of stuff lately, but I think she just wants to see if she can capture a moment that feels as relieving as hanging with Jeren used to be.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: And I think it almost, hmm. I don’t know how to make this work, but they used to basically have study dates where they’d just, like, hang out in a fucking study that they claimed at the library together.
Rhi: Oh, yeah.
Minna: Like maybe I have some notes that I have to comb through and I’m just like, I don’t know where we would do this study date now though, Jesus.
Rhi: Yeah, I think that he just has, as a combination of kind of like, his family connections and his job, he kinda just has free access to the library.
Minna: And I think we just kinda take over the old study room, like I send a note to him, like:
Minna (as Myra): Can you meet me at the old study? I just wanna hang out.
Minna: Probably not hang out, hang out isn’t the words, but like, it’s that vibe.
Rhi: Yeah. I think initially, like, you get there kind of, you know, a little bit before the time you had said and Jeren doesn’t show up for, like, he’s not there. He was like, ‘Oh meet me at two o’clock’, and two o’clock comes and goes and he’s not there.
Minna: I think she just resigns herself and, like, ends up actually engrossed in her notes.
Rhi: You know, when there’s a:
Rhi (as Voice): [clears throat]
Rhi: In front of you it’s a little startling. But you look up and Jeren’s standing there, has left the blue coat elsewhere and just has, like, you know, a satchel slung over his shoulder. And looks very much like he did when you two first met. And he’s just like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Uh, is this just…
Minna (as Myra): It’s just studying.
Rhi (as Jeren): Working on research, or did you–
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. I’m not asking for anything expect this.
Minna: She gestures around at the study.
Rhi: Yeah, I think he kind of like looks at the papers that she’s got all spread out and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Alright. I probably don’t wanna know what you’re working on.
Minna (as Myra): No, that’s better, but eh.
Minna: I think as she goes back to her studies, it’s pretty clear that she’s like, exhausted and kind of drained emotionally. But like, she’s not talking about it, she’s just… here.
Rhi: Yeah, I think he, you know, I’m picturing that it’s like those big long tables and I think Myra’s spread out on one side and I think he kind of like sets his bag down and pulls out a couple books and pulls a couple more off of some shelves and sits down and… hmm. What would be, like, some kind of snack that they would have had?
Minna: Oh man. Friend something or other? Dried? Like, ooh, maybe seaweed crisps.
Rhi: So yeah, I think that like, he sets up with his books and his papers and then reaches into the satchel again and pulls out a little bag of this dried sea salted seaweed, and sets it down between the two of them. Doesn’t say anything, just puts it out and then–
Minna: This is totally like a ritual, like an old ritual.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, this is what they used to do when Myra was pretending to be a college student.
Minna: She didn’t go to classes, she just did this.
Rhi: Yeah [laughs] So yeah, you have a nice afternoon of hanging out with your friend. Okay, hmm. I don’t actually have an idea in mind for kind of a wrap-up scene. Do you all have anything that you’d maybe wanna–
Minna: I know!
Rhi: Ooh?
Josie: Hmm?
Minna: We could come back to Blaire’s thing where she was like, we need to stop splitting up, basically. Because we had to cut it off because Blaire was going to sleep.
Kim: Oh, yeah. Well, Blaire’s still in her room.
Josie: Maybe it’s just Minx and Myra then?
Minna: Yeah, I was gonna say, I think Myra would pick up that theme. Yeah.
Josie: And maybe we’re, like, at the table, looking at Blaire’s door worriedly.
Kim: Aww, yeah.
Josie (as Minx): I should… I… we shouldn’t have split.
Minna (as Myra): I agree. I think I knew it at the time, but I just wanted to know so badly, you know?
Josie (as Minx): I understand.
Minna (as Myra): I think Blaire’s right, I don’t think we should do this anymore. We almost lost you once, and tonight was almost a disaster. Phin.
Josie (as Minx): The first time I was just making sure you all could get away. Tonight was our own hubris.
Minna (as Myra): Yes but heroics like that means that we still lose somebody, and we don’t have enough people to lose.
Josie (as Minx): Are you suggesting that if it comes down to it, we all go down together?
Minna (as Myra): That’s exactly what I’m suggesting.
Josie: Minx will offer her hand.
Minna: That’s so funny, that’s exactly what I was picturing. So I think they just, like, clasp hands.
Josie (as Minx): Let’s make it official then. Ride or die?
Minna (as Myra): Ride or die.

Kim: Can you take Minna’s?
Rhi: Nope.
[laughter]
Rhi: It’s always been mine, so. It’s the one time I get to roll in this game.
Kim: I know.
Minna: If it was low I don’t think I would tell you because it’s a trap.
Rhi: [laughs]"

Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Josie: This week’s featured charity is The Sandy Hook Promise, a non-profit that builds at the community level to push for gun control legislation, provide mental health and wellness programs, and policy aid for victims of gun violence. That being said, gun control is something I’m very passionate about. The amount of gun violence in this country is disgusting. So, really, any charities, any fundraisers you can find in the wake of these disasters is part of this. I feature The Sandy Hook Promise because I like what they do and they’re fairly widespread. So yeah, stand up against gun violence this month.
Rhi: The hardest part of choosing a Featured Charity is deciding where to shine a spotlight each month. There are so many real, existential threats facing so many people in the US and around the world. Reach out to organizations supporting racial justice, reproductive rights, trans rights, and immigrant rights, and contact your representatives to tell them to uphold and expand protections for all marginalized communities.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:29]
Kim: Blaire finds herself in the middle of The Deathlands finding herself surrounded by around ten to twelve ghosts, and they are all swirling around her, they are all looking at her, circling her, surrounding her, watching her every single move. Blaire looks around, and this is not something that she’s phased by, this is something that she’s used to, but at the same time it’s different. There’s a sense of unity to all of the ghosts’ movement, a kind of coordination that is very uncanny, very unlike anything that she’s seen before. In a split second, two of the ghosts just pass right through her as if they were about to possess her. She shields herself, raises her arms, looks down, closes her eyes, does everything that she’s used to when shielding herself from an arcane attack, but when she opens her eyes she is faced with cold, dark nothingness. She can just sense the amount of density that’s surrounding her ears. As she looks around she knows that she’s alone, and she is cold, and there’s no one there, and that this is the absence of absolutely everything she knows. It’s in that moment when she immediately snaps awake and bolts upright in her bed.
Rhi: So, Blaire is gonna start things off with level 1 harm, Exhaustion, because you haven’t been sleeping super well lately.
Kim: No, no I haven’t.
Rhi: Since your run-in with a spirit in the catacombs underneath the Lampblacks headquarters. Last couple of jobs that The Magpies have done have been a bit rough on the crew, to put it mildly. I know right now you all are kind of giving The Hound’s Paw some distance. That is still the place where if people want to contact you they send notes. So, I’m imagining that even though you’re not hanging around there for hours like you used to, somebody is going down there once or twice a week to just sort of pick up messages.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I am betting that someone is Myra or Blaire.
Kim: Probably Myra, I would think.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: The people who can pass unseen.
Rhi: Minx is perfectly capable of disguising herself, but I think she’s…
Josie: Right, but why would I do that? Have you seen me? [chuckles]
Rhi: [laughs] “Why would I cover up these looks?”
Kim: “Do you know who I am?”
Rhi: I think Myra has recently come back from The Hound’s Paw with your latest collection of messages. You’ve gotten two notes in the last couple days. One of them Rigney says just got dropped off last night, the other has been there for a few days. Which one does Myra start with?
Minna: The older one.
Rhi: Okay. The older one is a letter from Tuhan, one of the Silver Nails that you have worked with previously. Basically, this letter is saying that debt that you owe, of a favor, they are calling it in. Previously Myra had cut a deal with the Silver Nails where they would call in some debts that they were owed by a factory owner after the Magpies had relieved said factory owner of most of his liquid cash, so he wasn’t able to pay them. It worked out well for you, you took down the factory owner, foiled his plans – didn’t go so hot for the Silver Nails, because they’re out a lot of money. So, they now are asking you to acquire some objects for them. In the note it says that the deadline for acquiring these objects is tonight.
Josie: Oh!
Minna: What objects does it say?
Rhi: It doesn’t. It says to come speak with Tuhan for more details.
Minna: Ah.
Rhi: Yeah. They’re not gonna write down all of their crime plans in a note.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: But yeah, it’s basically like we need you to get some stuff for us, come to The Mustang for more details. So, that’s item one. Item two is in a very messy scrawl, and there’s a note at the top that says that this is written by Teagan on behalf of Briggs. Briggs sent you a note late last night. The unions, the unionization efforts rather in Charhollow and Coalridge have once again started running into some trouble with some of the factory owners and merchants. One of the union leaders, a person by the name of Artus is being blackmailed by someone. They refused to bow to the blackmail, and the person who’s blackmailing them plans to publish the information. Artus feels like they can weather this storm. Briggs isn’t so sure. Briggs is concerned that this is going to turn a lot of the people in the area, so they need to support these unionization efforts against them. So, Briggs wants you to break into the blackmailer’s house and steal the blackmail material. The problem is she is sending the information to the papers first thing tomorrow morning, so it also has to be taken care of tonight.
Josie: [long exhale]
Kim: Woof.
Josie (as Minx): If we must choose one, I do think it needs to be the Silver Nails simply so that we don’t get our kneecaps removed.
Minna (as Myra): I would prefer not to gain a reputation as somebody who does not repay her debts.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm.
Minna (as Myra): However, I am concerned about the situation in Charhollow.
Josie (as Minx): Do you think our former North Hook Mirror friends would be able to do something about the information being published?
Minna (as Myra): Oh, that’s interesting.
Josie (as Minx): I do not know where it’s being published or if they have connections there, but it would be—
Rhi: Pretty much the only paper in town now is the Doskvol Daily which was the North Hook’s main competitor.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: They, I think, did hire on some of the North Hook mirror’s former staff, but you’re not sure in what kind of positions or if Lani and Roxanne have any kind of pull with them.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Definitely worth inquiring. That’s a good idea.
Minna (as Myra): Maybe it’s just worth talking to both parties.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Let’s meet with the Silver nails first so that we can put that operation going in the back of our minds.
Rhi: Okay. So, you all finish breakfast. I imagine it’s kind of a later… I feel like you all are a pretty nocturnal group, so breakfast is at like 11 AM.
Kim: Oh yeah.
Josie: Indeed. [laughs]
Rhi: So, you head out up through Six Towers. I think that The Mustang, which is the tavern and inn that the Silver Nails own, it’s pretty slow mid-day. Their business picks up more in the evening. There’s not a lot of people there. After a few moments of waiting Tuhan comes jogging down the stairs and raises an eyebrow.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Well, better late than never I suppose. I thought you were just blowing us off.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, first of all, rude.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Uh, first of all, I sent you a letter asking you to pay your debt three days ago and you’ve just now decided to show up.
Josie (as Minx): Our mail service was delayed. What is it that you need?
Kim (as Blaire): We’re very busy people.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Uh-huh…
Rhi: She leads you into the tavern area, sits you down at a table, and says:
Rhi (as Tuhan): We’ve learned of some old journals that were written by people who used to live in The Lost District, kind of during its collapse. There’s a lot of information about locations, we’re hoping cashes of… well, interesting items.
Kim (as Blaire): How interesting?
Rhi (as Tuhan): Interesting enough for us.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi (as Tuhan): The contents of the journals don’t concern you. we just need you to get them from the merchant who has recently acquired them before they are transferred to Saltford’s ahead of an auction. Once they’re in Saltford’s they’re untouchable.
Minna (as Myra): Which merchant is this?
Rhi (as Tuhan): His name is Liam Solar. He’s got a manor in Brightstone. A little security obsessed, so it’s not exactly going to be a walk in the park, but we feel that this is more or less a fair trade for the 10 coin that you all cost us.
Minna: [astonished exhale]
Rhi: She shoots a very pointed look at Myra.
Minna: She is keeping a straight face.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ve dealt with higher security threats.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Well then, this should be no problem for you to acquire before they are transferred to Saltford’s. Get them, bring them back here, and we’ll be even.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. Pleasure doing business once again.
Rhi: Yeah, and I think she just stands up and walks off.
Josie: A simple break and enter is probably just what we need to do there. The trickiness is gonna be doing the other thing at the same time.
Kim: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): So, how do we wanna go about this?
Rhi: Did you want to go talk to Briggs first and get a little more information there?
Minna: I would. Yes. I would like to get information first.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. You all pile out of The Mustang which is at the north end of Six Towers, and it takes you probably… even taking a gondola or a cab it’s gonna take you probably another half hour, 40 minutes to get all the way down through to Charhollow, to the market where Briggs is set up. Briggs is, you know, in his clothing stall at the market as always. He’s got Mallory, his service dog, sitting there investigating the coins of the people who are making purchases from him when you walk in. When you step in he’s like:
Rhi (as Briggs): I’ll be with you in just a moment. I just need to finish up with these folks here.
Kim (as Blaire): No rush.
Josie (as Minx): Very well, dear.
Rhi (as Briggs): Oh! It’s you. Wonderful.
Rhi: So yeah, the folks who are in there finish paying and he waves a hand in the direction of the privacy curtain that he’s got at the front of the shop.
Rhi (as Briggs): One of you mind getting that for me?
Josie: I’ll do it.
Rhi: All right. You pull that across with the little bell chiming as you do so. Once that’s closed, he says:
Rhi (as Briggs): Oh, I’m glad you got my message. This is a fairly delicate situation.
Minna (as Myra): Who is the woman doing the blackmail?
Rhi (as Briggs): Her name is Mila Lorent, and she’s a merchant, trader, businesswoman, one of those people who seems to have her hands and money involved in just about everything.
Kim (as Blaire): So definitely the bigwig kind of type?
Rhi (as Briggs): A bit. She has a townhouse in Nightmarket, fairly secured from what I understand. She’s a very wealthy person. Somewhere, we believe, in her townhouse she is keeping the blackmail material that she’s going to be sending to the Daily tomorrow, and we need you to obtain that material before it can be published.
Josie (as Minx): That is something we can do, however would it not also work to simply defang the information?
Rhi (as Briggs): What do you mean?
Josie (as Minx): If, for example, a tamer version runs or something else overshadows it, then many simply won’t care. Or if the credibility of the information can be cast in doubt in some way.
Rhi (as Briggs): I mean, those are good ideas, but I’m not sure we have the time. If you have some sort of idea for how to do that in—
Josie (as Minx): We may have some contacts. I mean, failing that we will simply remove the items, but…
Rhi (as Briggs): Anything that you can do to prevent this from damaging Artus too badly. They’re quite a popular leader with the anarchists, and I’m afraid that if we lose them from our rough coalition it’s going to set us back quite a bit.
Minna (as Myra): May I ask, I’ll understand if you don’t want to share, but what is the nature of this information?
Rhi: [whispers] I haven’t actually figured it out.
[laughter]
Rhi: I was thinking of something like, uh… I don’t know. I figured I was gonna just have you guys figure that out— [silly] You could figure that out for me when you found the information was my plan~! [laughs] Getting back into character. Briggs kind of grimaces.
Rhi (as Briggs): I would rather not get into specific details. I mean, you’ll see when you find it, but there are some things in their family that would make a lot of people in many of our groups unhappy. You know, family doesn’t determine who you are, but not everybody sees things like that around here, and I think if they know what Artus’s family was mixed up in, ugh, it’s gonna fracture a lot of groups.
Josie (as Minx): Quite. That could be rather problematic.
Rhi (as Briggs): Indeed.
Josie (as Minx): Well, either way this will be stopped.
Minna (as Myra): We’ll do our best.
Rhi (as Briggs): I appreciate it.
Rhi: So, are the three of you gonna head out of Brigg’s stall then?
Josie: Yes.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Just so you know, I am gonna be paying close attention to how much time you all have, because basically your countdown timer is about dawn tomorrow. Saltford’s is gonna send an armored carriage to pick up the journals at dawn, and Mila will be leaving her home at dawn to deliver this information to the Daily.
Josie: Right. My thoughts are we have Lani and Roxanne either submit stories they’re already working on or come up with something have we can send to the Daily first so have it’ll look suspicious when the blackmail material comes in the morning after. The other option is to come up with a story even more scandalous and have that run so no one gives a shit when the other story runs.
Rhi: Yeah. You can definitely go chat with them. I’m gonna say at this point it’s early afternoon, it’s about 1 in the afternoon.
Josie: Can we… We should go to scandal grandma.
Minna: [excited gasp]
Rhi: Rose, I think her name was.
Minna: Oh my God!
Josie: Like, no, we should just get some gossip out of her that we can put in the paper and not have anyone give a shit about, you know, union troubles. Something really sensationalist and scandalous.
Rhi: Okay, I mean, you can…
Josie: [laughing] I know that’s kind of a cynical take on journalism and public appearance, but…
Minna: Yeah. We’re definitely talking an era inspired by an era where illustrated sensationalist papers were common.
Rhi: Yeah, and I mean, I can’t say that things are terribly different right now. [laughs]
Josie: Mm-hmm!
Minna: We’re just pulling a scandal right now.
Josie: Yes, I like that, and then we can have Lani and Roxanne then feed this to one of their contacts in the Daily.
Rhi: Assuming they have such contacts.
Josie: Assuming they have them, but it would be very good for that person, because they’d get their friend promoted, probably. But also failing that, we could probably simply deliver the story to someone working at the Daily.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. You can give this a shot.
Josie: And then once we drop that off, and we should make sure to do that tonight before dusk, we can just break and enter the other person, because we’re not splitting up again. We’re not doing that.
Kim: No.
Rhi: I had the idea for this, you know, competing scores thing well before you all, like—[laughs] I had this for weeks, and then you all were like “we’re never splitting up again,” and I was like… Oh my God.
Josie: Yes, but that is what friends are for.
Rhi: So, you head on over to Silkshore, it’s getting to be about mid-afternoon. You make your way over to the apartment where you remember Rose living. Somebody give me some kind of Gather Info roll to see how this goes.
Josie: Can I roll Consort?
Rhi: Sure.
Josie: Mmm!
Rhi: Hmm?!
Kim: How’d that go?
Josie: That’s a 2, 1, and a 2.
Rhi: That would be a 2, yeah.
Kim: Ooh…
Rhi: That is suboptimal. Okay.
Josie: Setting the tone for the evening. [laughs] Sorry dears.
Rhi: All right. So, limited information. I think Rose is home, and she’s delighted to see you.
Josie: Can I make a suggestion?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: That Minx and Rose, and possibly all of us, have a really pleasant tea and biscuits time and then just get way too deep into the weeds to actually get anything useful. [laughs]
Rhi: Oh yeah. Yeah! You have a great afternoon. Yeah, she gets you tea…
Minna: Oh God. Stress.
Rhi: …she’s got some more biscuits and cookies, she’s adopted a new cat which is really exciting.
Kim: AH!
Josie: Aww.
Kim: What kind of cat?!
Rhi: I am going to borrow from real life and give my friend’s new kitten a cameo, so it’s a little black kitten who has one of his back legs amputated, but it doesn’t slow him down any.
Kim & Josie: Aww~
Rhi: He just kind of weaves back and forth a little bit when he runs. He’s very cute.
Kim: [enthusiastic growl] Can I pet him?!
Rhi: Yes, you may pet him.
Kim: Blaire pets him! Blaire pets the cat.
Minna: [giggles]
Josie: Blaire is distracted by cats.
Rhi: Yeah. You all have a great time and you’re asking her for local gossip and she’s telling you about some weird, funny and weird stuff she’s seen in the street outside, and it’s all entertaining stories, but none of it is scandal worthy.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: And you also spend a couple hours there. It’s late afternoon by the time you leave.
Kim: Oh boy.
Josie: Oh dear.
Minna: [deep breath]
Josie: Well, at least failing everything else, we had a pleasant afternoon.
Rhi: Yeah, you had a really nice afternoon. [laughs] You had a good time. You got to hang out with some cats. You all each have a little baggy of cookies that she sent you on your way with.
Josie: I’ll have to ask her for the recipe for these.
Rhi: Told you to, you know, come back and visit anytime.
Josie: [smiling] Mm-hmm!
Rhi: But yeah, you didn’t actually get any scandalous information.
Josie (as Minx): All right. In that case, we might need to ask Lani and Roxanne to make something up. [laughs nervously]
Kim (as Blaire): Will they agree to do that, though?
Rhi: So, you head over to The Docks from Silkshore, and it’s getting late afternoon into evening by the time you get there, and you’re just gonna head up to their apartment?
Josie: Yes.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay. So, head on up, hit the door light, basically, it’s not really a doorbell, and it flashes. After a moment the door cracks open and you see Roxanne peering out, and then she sees you and brightens and opens it.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Oh, hello. I wasn’t expecting to see you here.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, it was rather unexpected on our end as well. It is some amount of time-sensitive business.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Oh. Do you want to come in?
Kim (as Blaire): If you don’t mind.
Rhi: Yeah. She’ll usher you in. The very small apartment is filled with a nice, hardy cooking smell. It’s about dinner time, and Lani waves at you from the kitchen where she’s cooking dinner, but she seems to be mostly focused on that. She does kind of split her attention between glancing at Roxanne, who is signing through everything, and paying attention to the food.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Yeah. What did you need?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. You are aware of the current Charhollow union situation, yes?
Rhi (as Roxanne): Yes. We reported on it a few times in the past.
Josie (as Minx): Right. We have gained word that some highbrow person wishes to sabotage this by submitting blackmail to the Daily. We were wondering if you had any friends or former employees who ended up there, and if you have any juicy scoops that can be run instead, because this would be very damaging if it were to run and the people of Charhollow deserve better.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Indeed…
Rhi: Let’s give them a roll and see what they’ve got. Oh…
Josie: [seethes]
Kim: That didn’t sound good.
Rhi: No, that would be the sound of a 3, a 2, and a 2.
Kim: Oh, the dice are cursing us tonight. Great! Great.
Josie: The funny thing is usually the Gather Information stage goes very well for us.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Yes. This is the portion of the adventure we’re doing well, before the dice turn.
Kim: Consistently.
Josie: We usually come into a score very well-prepared, regardless of how it goes after.
Kim: Yeah, so this doesn’t bode well.
Rhi: No. [laughs] So, Roxanne frowns and is thinking for a little bit and then shakes her head.
Rhi (as Roxanne): I mean, we… Aside from the work that you have us doing for investigations, we’re not really looking for any sort of, those sort of things anymore. We just don’t have the time.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Yes, of course, that makes sense.
Rhi (as Roxanne): We know a few people who now work at the daily, but they aren’t reporters. They hired some of the North Hook’s reporters, but they didn’t give them reporting jobs. They work in the printing room now, mostly typesetters and things like that.
Josie (as Minx): They work on the printers?
Rhi (as Roxanne): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): Work on the printers…
Minna (as Myra): How much quality control is there? Could we like… switch out stories somewhere in the process?
Rhi (as Roxanne): Um…
Josie (as Minx): Now that is a thought, or simply some printing errors occur.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Potentially, but if what gets printed is too different from what the reporter submitted or what editorial approved then the people in the printing press will be the ones punished for it, and I’d prefer not to…
Josie (as Minx): Right.
Minna (as Myra): [sympathetic groan]
Josie (as Minx): And then there’s nothing stopping them from simply issuing a correction the next day.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Precisely.
Josie: Hmm. Minx kind of has her hand on her chin and is nervously pacing a little bit.
Kim (as Blaire): You okay?
Josie (as Minx): I… I just really don’t want us to split up this time.
Kim (as Blaire): We won’t if we don’t have to.
Minna (as Myra): I agree that we shouldn’t split up. It may be that the time has come that we have to make choices.
Kim (as Blaire): Whatever we choose, it’s gonna be okay.
Josie (as Minx): The people of Charhollow deserve better than what they have gotten, however I don’t know if we can withstand the Silver Nails at this time. It wouldn’t do to have another enemy.
Rhi: Roxanne is looking back and forth amongst all of you, looking increasingly worried. [laughs] She doesn’t know all of the background of this conversation, but everything you’re saying sounds very bad.
Minna (as Myra): I wish… After this, we need to find a better way of getting messages.
Josie (as Minx): Right. Right. That’ll be something to look into. The unioners, would the movement be so severely damaged by one person being blackmailed? Briggs, he seemed to think so.
Rhi: So, the issue that the union organizers have been having is that you have all of these small groups that some of them have their own special interests. They have been trying to build these small groups that don’t all get along into a larger coalition. That fragile coalition is sort of holding together. Briggs is concerned that this news could break a lot of those groups apart. The individual groups will still exist, but they won’t all be working together towards the same goal anymore. It’s not going to completely decimate the unionization movement, but it’s going to undo a lot of the hard work that they have done.
Josie: And if we do not even so much as attempt the task Briggs will not be a friend anymore, most likely.
Rhi: It’s gonna damage that relationship. I’ll tell you, mechanically, like from a game mechanics perspective, you’re gonna lose your lookouts.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: So, this is a thing that happens, again, with being vigilantes. When you get, on your claim map, those claims, you have to defend them, because again, you don’t have a gang that you can send and be like “hey, hold this turf, go be lookouts for me.” Every time you have a claim it starts a clock.
Josie: Right, but also for a similar reason, we really don’t want to start another gang war.
Rhi: Yes. [laughs]
Minna: Did we get a sense that it’s definitely like gang war if we don’t hold up our end of the bargain with the Silver Nails?
Rhi: The Silver Nails are going to expect you to pay one way or another.
Minna: Hmm.
Josie: Yes, this is the ‘do it or we break your kneecaps’ situation.
Rhi: Yeah. You cost them a lot of money. Ten coin is an enormous amount of money.
Kim: Yeah…
Josie: Yes. It’s a bit of a lose-lose situation, because we cannot lose too much credibility as a gang, otherwise we’ll simply be eaten alive, however we can’t really afford to be losing the trust of the people, because that is our whole point.
Minna: And it’s not just trust that we lose, it’s… I don’t want to set back all of that work, the vital work that we’re not able to do ourselves.
Kim: Right.
Josie: Yes. I’m starting to wonder if… Would there be able to be someone else that we could simply put up to replace this person? Is there anyone with that sort of charisma and clout?
Minna: It’s not just charisma and clout, it’s gotta be a relationship.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: I don’t think any of you are tied enough into the union movement to really know somebody that you could point to and be like ‘oh yeah, this person.’
Kim: Right.
Josie: And this is all still happening in front of Lani and Roxanne, by the way. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughing] Yeah. Roxanne has at some point recognized that the three of you are just off in your own little thing and has wandered off to help Lani keep making dinner.
Josie: Uh-huh. [laughs]
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: [laughs] Well, I mean, she understands. “Yeah, okay. You all, you’re going through something. You need a private place to talk. This is fine. We’re gonna get back to our night. You all just hang out on that half of the room while we make dinner.”
Josie: [laughs] Okay.
Minna: [smiling] God, we’re imposing so badly.
Kim: We are very bad houseguests.
Rhi: [smiling] You are free to remove yourselves at any point. I’m just— [laughs] It’s fine. Roxanne was just kinda like, “I’m just- I’ll be over here,” and just walked off.
Josie: Well, we need to go back to The Nest anyway to prepare for some sort of job tonight, so we might as well do that while we talk.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: I will excuse us and apologize for the intrusion, using some of my slowly improving sign language.
Rhi: Yeah! When you sign out that whole thing, Lani kind of brightens up a little bit, and then one of the words you got the sign a little bit wrong so she shows you the correct version, and then they both say goodbye as you head out.
Josie: Yay.
Minna: Yay.
Josie: Awesome.
Kim (as Blaire): Hope we weren’t any trouble.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Roxanne): No, no, it’s fine. I hope this all turns out okay for you. it sounds like you have a lot going on.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll keep you posted. It’ll be okay.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Okay. Be safe out there.
Kim (as Blaire): We will. You too.
Josie: Here’s the thing, being transferred to the Doskvol Daily, that was almost assuredly a lower security caravan. The thing going to the bank is gonna be in like an armored wagon or the like.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: This is an independent person just delivering information to the paper. There will likely be security, but we may have to break and enter in to get the journals for the Silver Nails, and then, in transit, knock over whoever’s heading to the Daily.
Minna: Wait. So, blackmail… for money?
Rhi: I think Briggs would have explained this. It wasn’t a payoff, it was a like, leave town, basically. Leave your position in charge, like…
Minna: So more extortion?
Josie: Yes. I think we need to make a quick robbery.
Minna: Heh. A quick robbery of a high security place in Brightstone.
Josie: And then, get away from that quietly enough to stake out the Daily and knock over the other thing.
Rhi: Have I said where the Doskvol Daily is located?
Kim: I don’t know if you have. I think it’s in The Docks.
Rhi: No, because if it was on Ink Row it would have burned too. I think it’s in Charterhall.
Kim: Oh damn.
Josie: We might just be committing to two scores in a row here.
Rhi: Yup.
Kim: Pretty much.
Minna: [deep breath]
Kim: Jesus.
Josie: We’re gonna have a Stealth score and then an Assault score.
Rhi: Yep.
Kim: Ugh, Christ.
Rhi: And you’re basically gonna have to, like, I’m gonna say, we’ll see how the first score goes to see if you’ll have time to switch your load out. You probably won’t.
Kim: That would be preferable. Mm, but I would like that.
Rhi: It’s gonna depend on how things go. Well, you know, there’s a lot of things that I’m sure you would like [laughs] that are probably not gonna happen.
Josie: One thing we need to commit to beforehand, because we won’t have time to argue it later, if shit goes south trying to get the Silver nails journals, are we bailing in favor of getting the blackmail or are we committing to getting the journals even if it means we miss the wagon? Because I hate to say it, it seems like the unionization movement sounds more resilient. It would set them back, but it wouldn’t destroy them, and we can help repair.
Minna: I can commit to helping repair.
Kim: Yeah. We may be able to help them bounce back. Yeah.
Josie: All right. So, if things do end up taking a long time paying off the Silver nails we should just commit to that and then deal with the fallout of the other going through. Ideally that won’t be a thing, but we must plan for a worst case scenario.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Survival has to be the first priority.
Josie: Yes, and we can’t afford to fail both. If we do, we may just need to leave town for a month or so.
Minna: I don’t think we can leave town.
Josie: I don’t know. I’m sure I could charm our way into some train tickets.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Generally speaking, yeah you could leave town, but you’re not gonna have anything to come back to. That’s kind of the nature of Duskwall. If you are not physically present to defend your territory you would not have a home to return to. Somebody else would move into The Nest.
Josie: Right.
Minna: We would be starting over.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: In general, if you’re gone for that long. You can leave town for a few days and things will probably be okay, which I’m establishing right now, because I’m gonna send you all on a train heist at some point. [laughs]
Josie: Unfortunately it’s a matter of what is ultimately hurt feelings versus our lives.
Kim: Our lives and a hurt cause.
Josie: And I hate to say that given what our cause is.
Rhi: Put on your own oxygen mask first is basically what Minx is saying here.
Josie: Yes. We’re no good to the cause dead.
Rhi: By the time you all finish with your getting back to The nest and discussing your options and getting your gear together it’s about 9:00 at night. You haven’t actually done any reconnaissance on the house you’re planning to rob.
Josie: We can do that when we get there.
Rhi: You’re just gonna head up there, do a little bit of quick scouting, and then dive in?
Minna: [nervously] Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yikes. Big yikes.
Rhi: I see no way this will go wrong. Yeah, you make your way up into Brightstone, which is well-lit and well-patrolled by the Bluecoats. The Silver Nails did tell you where this guy’s house is. It’s a big, old manor house. You all can do some Gather Info on the manor.
Kim: Can I roll a Survey?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Okay. My highest on that was a 5.
Rhi: Okay. What are you looking for specifically with this Survey?
Kim: Getting an idea of the groundwork of the area. Where are the main exit and entrance points? Where are places that are more highly secured? Some that may have some kind of vulnerability? Things like that.
Rhi: Okay. The whole manor is surrounded by a wrought-iron fence. There’s the front door, side door, back door, and then behind the house is a smaller carriage house. There’s a gate in the back of the fence where a carriage could pull in to go into the carriage house. Out front of the carriage house there’s a couple guards hanging out. It’s well-lit. There’s lights on both the front of the house and on the carriage house.
Josie: I would like to memorize some Bluecoat patrols.
Rhi: Yeah. How do you want to go about doing that?
Josie: Survey, preferably.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you can do that.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Six, okay.
Josie: Yeah. I don’t want us coming out, turning a corner, and running smackdab into a patrol.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, I think that you are aided here by the fact that you spend a lot of time in Brightstone doing other stuff, your socializing and buying art, and I think probably your new vice is up here, so you are a little more familiar with how the Bluecoats operate up here. I’m not gonna give the details of “this is when this patrol comes by,” but you have a good sense of, you can look at a clock and be like “we need to lay low for another five minutes to wait for this patrol to pass” or whatever. Basically, you are in a position where you are unlikely to, if you leave quietly and haven’t alerted the Bluecoats in some other fashion, won’t run into the Bluecoats on your exit.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Myra?
Minna: This is a place that has servants and stuff, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I think on the street I’m gonna try and like chat with some servants like I am a servant who’s on my rounds or like newish in the area and I’m just curious about the people around here, try and figure out who lives in the house and maybe some of their habits.
Rhi: Okay. You’re gonna be at reduced effect for this, because it’s like 9, 9:30 at night. There’s not a lot of people out on the street.
Minna: That’s fair.
Rhi: The best you can do is standard information. You’re just not gonna be as successful with this, but you can definitely give it a shot.
Minna: Well, I rolled a 5.
Rhi: Okay. That is gonna just get you limited information in this instance. I think you’re able to talk with somebody who is a driver in this area. What kind of questions would you be asking here?
Minna: I mean, first of all, who all lives in the house.
Rhi: Yeah. That kind of, yeah, leading around to that sort of thing.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: It’s Liam Solar and his family, which is a spouse and… I am going to roll a die to determine the number of children. One. Liam is a pretty security-minded individual.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Early on in his career as a merchant he had, you know, criminals broke into his house and robbed him pretty badly and he swore it would never happen again.
Minna: Cool. Cool.
Rhi: Yeah. The high security level of the Solar estate is a little bit of a point of gossip. He has a little bit of a reputation for being paranoid, I think, among the other nobles.
Rhi (as Driver): Ugh, if you’re working there, it’s impressive that you made it past all the background checks.
Minna (as Myra): I live a very clean life.
Rhi (as Driver): You must have to, or you paid the right people off, but that’s none of my business. Anyway, I gotta get going.
Rhi: And you know, he’s gonna head off. So, that’s what you’ve got.
Kim: Cool, cool, cool.
Rhi: Whatcha all doing for load out?
Josie: I’m doing a normal load.
Kim: Normal as well.
Rhi: How about you?
Minna: I said yep, which meant normal.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Boy, I am stressed out about this score~
Rhi: Engagement roll~ Obviously this is, I’m assuming, a Stealth score?
Kim & Josie: Yes.
Rhi: What are you all thinking for your point of entry?
Josie: I want to go in through the back where the wagon would come.
Kim: The carriage house… Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. You get one for luck. You’re in Brightstone which counts as hostile turf, so you’re at reduced on that… Alright, this is gonna be a 2d6 and take the lower. Okay, so I have good news.
Kim: Okay?
Rhi: The lowest was a 4.
Minna: [gasps]
Josie: Excellent!
Rhi: So, you’re starting in a risky position. The other die I rolled was a 6. This is the best roll that I’ve had in ages. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: We could still deal with 4.
Rhi: I think you first, like, your starting in a risky position is that you’re at a back gate, it’s locked, it’s fairly well-lit, and there are two guards.
Josie: [tight] Neat.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Okay. So, we want those guards away… The other option is through the front, because just going over the fence isn’t gonna work, most likely. Someone this paranoid has likely done something. Would it be ultimately detrimental to set off a distant distraction?
Rhi: I dunno.
Kim: I think we gotta do something like that, either toss a rock or some kind of minor distraction so that way their attention is drawn somewhere else.
Josie: Right. I was thinking almost like breaking the window in the house next over, but I don’t know if they will send help or merely batten down the hatches here, is the thing.
Kim: Hmm. That’s a good point. I didn’t consider that.
Minna: My brain is really awful today, because all it keeps screaming is “set fire!”
Rhi: Mine too!
[laughter]
Kim: Um… Eh…
Josie: I mean—
Rhi: [smiling] I was also thinking you should, that a fire is very distracting.
Minna: Like we could set fire to the carriage house.
Kim: [nervous noises]
Josie: That would certainly draw manpower away.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: What if we set fire close to the house next door and have it trail closer to the carriage house? Would that be better?
Josie: Yes. It’s a matter of how we morally feel about endangering an unrelated person.
Kim: An innocent.
Josie: Yes.
Kim: Ugh. That’s tough.
Josie: They are rich assholes, but there may be children in there or the like.
Kim: Yep. There could be children or pets in there. Um…
Minna: Wait. Could we do a Survey to see if there’s anything around the carriage house that we could set a fire under?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Would that be a Survey to figure that out?
Rhi: Sure. Survey would work.
Kim: Alright, I’m gonna roll a Survey. I’m gonna push myself, too, for the extra dice. Okay, so these dice are getting banned. That’s a 1 and a 2.
Rhi: [cackles] Fuck me running.
Kim: I’m just looking! I’m not doing anything! I’m looking around!
Rhi: Things go badly. You suffer harm, a complication occurs, you end up in a desperate position, you lose this opportunity.
Kim: Rhi! [laughs]
Rhi: You walk up to the bars of the fence, wrap your little hands around it, and put your face up to the bars and look in…
Kim: [groans]
Rhi: …and one of the guards goes:
Rhi (as Guard): Hey! Hey, who’s over there? You’re not supposed to—What are you doing over there?
Rhi: And gets up and is walking towards you.
Kim: Can I fall back, or do they already see me and I have to engage?
Rhi: Uh, I mean, yeah. The guard has seen that there is a person at the fence.
Kim: Okay. I think if they’ve already seen me it’s more suspicious if I run away, so I’m just gonna play this card and hope that it goes well, if that’s all right.
Kim (as Blaire): [whining] I’m sorry, but I’m lost. I’m trying to get back to Six Towers?
Rhi: So, you’re still in a risky position.
Minna: Wait, I’m gonna spend a stress to assist you.
Rhi: Yeah? How are you assisting?
Minna: I think she’s gonna do a soft, far away sounding:
Minna (as Myra): Melly?
Kim: Melly?
Minna: Like there’s multiple lost people, including your character, Melly. [chuckles]
Kim: Okay, well, you’re gonna have to be my mom, or sister, or something. I’m gonna roll.
[laughter]
Minna: Uh-huh.
Kim: Okay, good, that’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay!
Kim: [laughs nervously] I’m banning…
Rhi: The guard sighs, and I think when the guard gets closer you can see that, out from under the brim of his hat, which you notice now that he’s closer, the hat and his head is kind of a weird shape because he also has horns.
Kim & Josie: Oh…
Rhi: He’s also Tycherosi. They’re not exactly like Blaire’s, his are more like the curled back over his ears type.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: He comes over and sees this lost little Tycherosi girl and feels bad, and he’s like:
Josie: Aw.
Rhi (as Tycherosi Guard): Ugh, all right, hang on a second…
Rhi: Someone give me a name real fast.
Kim: Ben.
Rhi (as Tycherosi Guard): Hey Ben? I’m gonna step out for just a couple minutes. Can you cover for me?
Rhi: And the other guy’s like:
Rhi (as Ben): Yeah, yeah, it’s a boring night anyway.
Rhi: So, he unlocks the gate, slips through, closes behind, locks it up, and is like:
Rhi (as Tycherosi Guard): All right. Come on, kid. It sounded like somebody was calling.
Minna: Yeah. I think Myra’s moved away from where Minx is and is kind of looking, seeming to look around in the wrong direction.
Kim (as Blaire): Jessabelle? Jessabelle, I’m over here.
Rhi: Yeah, so he’s gonna walk you away, but he’s walking with you and is going to meet up with Myra at the end of the street and then like…
Josie: Are we out of sight of the other guard?
Rhi: Those two are, it’s just Minx and this other guard right now.
Josie: All right. I’m gonna wait for things to resolve there, and hopefully this guy will come out looking, at which point I will trance powder him. [laughs]
Minna: [smiling] So, what I’m gonna do is, I’m playing a very effusive person who’s very worried and has just frantically hugged Melly.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): [sadly] It’s okay, I’m here.
Minna: And she’s gonna pull away and like hug the guard really tight, and then slip from out of her pocket…
[laughter]
Kim: This is very sneaky and very good.
Minna: And then after, in the midst of the guard flailing, just like press it to his face, press the cloth to his face. Wa-hey! I got a crit!
[someone claps]
Rhi: Jesus. Okay. So…
Minna: Do I just knock him out real good and he doesn’t wake up as easily?
Rhi: Well, you get—Yeah. He’s gonna be knocked out for a while. He is not gonna be a problem anymore. I am gonna say, okay, I’m gonna say this is the… This person has, aside from his oddly shaped head, a build that is fairly similar to Myra. Both of the guards were wearing long overcoats and caps.
Minna: Oh, so I just take the coat and cap and vaguely look like him.
Rhi: Yeah. You don’t have the right head shape, because he’s got those horns, but you know, it might be enough to get you through the gate.
Minna: Especially if there’s a distraction.
Rhi: I think that all happens very quickly. It’s before the other guard thinks that anything is wrong and is coming to investigate. Yeah, so how do you want to proceed here? I think Minx is still waiting to see if this guy is gonna come out.
Minna: Okay. I slide up beside her, still hidden from the other guard, and tip my hat up.
Josie (as Minx): [whispering] Oh, excellent.
Minna: She smiles.
Josie (as Minx): [whispering] Try to get the gate open, and I will take care of the other guy.
Minna: Yeah. Myra holds up her keys, puts a finger to her lips, and pulls out of the shadows to go strolling up casually to the gate to unlock it.
Rhi: Yeah, I think you’re gonna need to make a roll to not alert this guy that something’s wrong, because like, you have to imitate a walk and you have to be able to get the right key pretty quickly.
Minna: That almost feels like a Sway to me.
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: Okay. I got a 6, though.
Kim: Woo! Phew.
Rhi: Oh, okay. Yeah, so you unlock the gate. I think you feign locking the gate behind you, but you leave it open so that your compatriots can get in.
Minna: Mm-hmm. I think I go back silently to my spot.
Rhi: The other guard looks over at Myra and is squinting a little bit. I think Myra has posted up in some shadows, so like… It’s slowly starting to dawn on this guy that’s something’s off, but he can’t quite tell what yet, but he’s distracted by looking at Myra trying to figure out what’s off so the two of you could get in through the gate.
Josie: Yeah. I’m gonna go in through the gate, trance powder to that guy’s face.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I guess I’ll be sneaking behind Minx very carefully.
Rhi: Minx, go ahead and make a roll.
Josie: Is Skirmish appropriate for getting the trance powder into his face?
Rhi: Yeah. Sure.
Josie: Critical.
Rhi: Geez. All right.
Minna: Damn.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: We’re doing okay.
Rhi: Yeah. Rough start, but you’ve turned it around.
Minna: The opposite pattern from usual.
Rhi: I think what happens, Minx, you like creep up in the shadows while this guy is squinting intently at Myra, and then it dawns on him, “this is not my guard partner,” and he [deep inhale, preparing to shout] at which point Minx throws the trance powder in his face and he inhales a whole bunch of it, so like his friend he is also going to just be out cold for the rest of the score. He will not be an issue going forward.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, that went smoother than I thought.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, quite, although we still must move quickly.
Josie: What entrances are on this side of the gate?
Rhi: There’s a back door and then a side door on the building, and the front door obviously, but the back door is closest.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Let’s try the back door.
Rhi: Off to the back door. They would have a key to the back door, so you’re able to unlock it…
Josie: Excellent.
Rhi: …and slip into the kitchen. It’s a nice kitchen.
Josie: How many stories is this house?
Rhi: Three. It’s a big house.
Josie: Okay. I think the first order of business is to… where would he keep these? Probably in a vault of some kind, yes? Or safe?
Minna: A vault or an office or something.
Josie: Yes. Let’s look for a study.
Kim: Should we roll a group action to figure that out?
Rhi: Yeah, some kind of group thing for sneaking through the house, looking for what you need.
Kim: A group Survey or group Study, which one are you guys down with?
Minna: I have better Study.
Kim: So do I. Minx?
Josie: Okay. I don’t have any dots in Study, but since it’s a group action we can probably afford that.
Minna: I think Study works.
Rhi: Okay. Who is leading it?
Minna: I can.
Rhi: Okay. Everybody roll. This is risky still.
Minna: Six.
Kim: Four.
Josie: I got a 2.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: One point of stress, and we have a 6.
Rhi: So, you are creeping around the ground floor of this house and you do find an office, and inside this office you find something even more interesting. It looks like the rest of the doors in the house, it’s just kind of a tastefully wood paneled door, but unlike the rest of the interior doors in the house that have very nice, those like crystal doorknobs, this door has a really, really heavy duty lock on it.
Kim: Oof. Does it look to be like it’s rigged to set off any kind of alarm?
Rhi: I don’t know, you would have to investigate it in some way to find out.
Kim: Okay. Can I roll a Survey for that?
Rhi: Study would be more apt for this.
Kim: All right, yeah, I have a higher Study anyway. My highest was a 5.
Rhi: Five, okay. Blaire, you crouch down and spend some time really intently studying this lock. It is rigged to an alarm system. If it is tampered with improperly it will set off an alarm.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And, you hear footsteps in the hall upstairs above you. I’m gonna start Household Guards, 1 out of 4.
Kim: Oh boy. I don’t like that.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Would looking into the ghost field… I mean, out of character, mechanically the way it would work, would it kind of give somewhat, you know, Batman Arkham series kind of vision where you would be able to see someone who’s upstairs even if they’re living?
Rhi: Yeah, living people do have a signature in the ghost field, it’s not as bright.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: You can try, but… Ghosts you can see in the ghost field at much greater distances. Living signatures can be blocked by distance. They can be blocked by just material, like the floor could block them. So yeah, you can try to Attune to the ghost field and try to spot whoever’s up there.
Kim: I think that would be a good idea if you guys focus on taking care of the lock while I keep lookout.
Rhi: You’re the only one with Tinker.
Minna: You’re our lock pick.
Kim: Ugh. But I’m the only one with 2 in Attune!
Josie: I have none in Attune and Myra has some, yes?
Kim: I only have 1 in Tinker though, I don’t have 2.
Rhi: That’s more than anybody else has.
Josie: Well, I was gonna assist you.
Kim: Okay, and Myra, do you want to keep watch?
Minna: Yeah. I mean, I don’t think I necessarily have to use Attune to keep watch, do I?
Rhi: No. You can just keep watch with your regular eyes, not your special ghost eyes.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: “They can’t have my brand, I have special ghost eyes.”
[laughter]
Kim: “My brand!” I’m going to mark off tinkering tools just to help me out a little. I’m gonna roll Tinker.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Actually, I was gonna have my way of helping be that Minx brought hers, and given that she doesn’t usually use them, and that she’s also an obsessive neat freak, they’re in really good condition. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Oh! So in that case, I don’t have to mark off tinkering tools?
Rhi: Right. Yeah.
Kim: Okay, that works.
Rhi: Minx will carry that load for the team. You are in a risky position, reduced effect.
Kim: [nervously] Okay!
Rhi: Because you don’t have fine tinkering tools. This is a pretty hefty lock.
Kim: Gang, that’s uh… that’s double 2s.
Josie: That’s bad, that’s real bad.
Kim: So, what does that leave us with, Rhi?
Rhi: [slowly] That alarm’s going off.
Kim: [fearful] No!
Minna: Can I resist that effect?
Rhi: You can—Well…
Minna: Or can someone?
Rhi: Blaire’s the one who caused it, so you can resist that consequence.
Kim: Yes, I would like to.
Rhi: You could resist any consequence, so yeah, you can roll to resist.
Kim: And it’s my resistance to Insight?
Rhi: Yeah, Insight makes sense for this.
Kim: All right, my highest on that was a 4.
Rhi: Okay, so you’re gonna take 2 stress.
Kim: I can deal with that.
Rhi: You’re working with the lock, and you almost twist one of the picks in a certain way, and then you kind of see some wire in there and you’re like okay, no…
Kim: Needle taught me how to do this. She taught me how to recognize this.
Rhi: Yeah… You haven’t really made any progress in actually getting this lock open.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So, you don’t set off the alarm, but you also are still gonna have to roll again.
Kim (as Blaire): This is a really tough one.
Josie (as Minx): Well, we have time.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, how are we looking?
Minna (as Myra): I think we’re okay so far.
Kim (as Blaire): Do we have time?
Kim: I’m just asking in the general sense. Like, can we afford to keep at this?
Rhi: I mean, you have to. What choice do you have?
Josie (as Minx): I believe we can. We’re gonna push forward on this.
Rhi: There is a big grandfather clock in the office, though. It’s about 10:00 at night. Maybe between 10 and 10:30 at night.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m gonna have to try again, but…
Josie (as Minx): Take a deep breath. Remember Needle.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, I’m nervous.
Josie (as Minx): I know. I know. I know, dear. Just take your time. We’re both here. We’ve both got your back here.
Minna (as Myra): You’ll be fine.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Josie (as Minx): Yes, you’re good at this.
Minna (as Myra): We trust you.
Kim (as Blaire): [exhales] Okay.
Kim: [gasps, surprise and relief] Highest was a 6.
Rhi: Okay!
Kim: Whoa.
Josie: Phew!
Rhi: So, yeah, I think you’re able to get it open without setting off the alarm or anything.
Kim: Is there any consequence, though? Are we good?
Rhi: No, you’re good, I’m just fudging the rules in terms of what is interesting to do and listen to. Technically you’re at reduced effect, so I probably shouldn’t have had you get through the door in one go, but I don’t want to spend ten minutes of Blaire tries to pick a lock. That’s not good radio.
Minna: It’s basically a D&D combat for a lock at that point.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Blaire VS the lock’s HP. So yeah, you get the door open.
Josie: Minx is gonna ruffle Blaire’s hair.
Josie (as Minx): See? Everything’s fine.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks.
Rhi: And on the other side of the door, which opens on silent hinges, this is very well-oiled, there is a staircase descending down into some kind of basement. The stairs go down, there’s a landing, and then they turn and go out of sight, so you don’t know what’s at the bottom.
Kim: But do they go down, down in an earlier round? … And sugar, we’re going down swinging?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I know what you’re referencing, I just was staring blankly at you… as I do.
Kim: [proudly] I’m just asking.
Rhi: [grinning reluctantly] Are you going down the stairs or not?
Kim: Yes. [laughs]
Rhi: So, you head down the stairs and get to the landing and you turn, and basically there’s another kind of short stairs going down to a small, open room. On one wall of this small room is like a bank vault? Like one of those big, round, steel doors with a really complicated lock on it.
Kim: Oh…
Josie: Gods above.

## Blooper [1:00:25]
Rhi: So, I feel like I should warn all of you, and Minna can attest to this, the last several games I’ve been in I have been rolling like hot garbage.
Minna: Yeah… Can we roll for you? [laughs]
Rhi: No. [laughs] I gotta just ride this curse out! If I keep rolling I’ll get all the bad rolls out!
Kim: You might wanna like burn some sage or sprinkle some salt water around your desk.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: [into hands] I don’t know. I keep cycling through new dice and it’s not making a difference?
Minna: Yeah. Even the trusty AcadeCon dice have turned against her.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Kim: Okay. you definitely need to do some cleansing then.
Rhi: Yeah. Get some candles in here. I don’t know. But yeah, I’ve been rolling like garbage lately, and it so far is carrying over into this game. I apologize. [laughs]"

Next, Kim’s going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Kim: Styles 4 Kidz is a Chicago based organization that provides education to multiracial and adoptive families on how to style and care for Black natural hair. Their salon offers a safe and judgment-free zone for parents to learn about their child’s hair, teaches them the skills they need, and recommends them haircare products meant for afro textured hair. They also provide services to children living in residential facilities and detention centers and children with special needs. To sponsor a child or to donate visit www.Styles4Kidz.org.
Rhi: Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:34]
Rhi: So, you head down the stairs and get to the landing and you turn, and basically there’s another kind of short stairs going down to a small, open room. On one wall of this small room is like a bank vault? Like one of those big, round, steel doors with a really complicated lock on it.
Kim: Oh…
Josie: Gods above.
Rhi: Hey, paranoid. The lock here is, both, there’s a keyhole and there’s a combination.
Minna: Multi-factor authentication.
Rhi: It’s very fair to assume that there are alarms wired to this. You can see that kind of brushed steel look, and you can see pretty faintly, but still visible, there are like arcane wards etched into the metal as well.
Kim: Oh no.
Josie: Geez.
Rhi: So like, this security is a lot.
Kim: At the same time, this is not iron Hook levels of security, which is why I feel okay. Kind of.
Rhi: [noncommittal noise, “yeah” / “eh”]
Josie: I think we might just need to take our time and get through each of these one by one.
Kim: Very carefully, yes.
Josie: Yeah. Disable the arcane wards…
Rhi: Yeah. You’ve got arcane wards, spark-craft alarms, combination lock, key lock.
Josie: I think we should focus on disabling the alarms and such, and then we might be able to brute force what remains.
Minna: Can you take a look at those wards?
Josie: I don’t have any knowledge of the arcane.
Rhi: Blaire, you can investigate those. You don’t have to roll anything to look at them, because they’re very obviously wards of basically protection and alarm.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: The way that I think about arcane alarms is that it’s kind of like a psychic link, with you pay a Whisper to set this up and they create a link between the ward and the person who owns it, so this Liam guy might just suddenly bolt upright in bed and be like [severe] “I’m being robbed. Not today.”
Kim: Yeah.
[laughter]
Minna: I just had this image, and feel free to shoot me down, but like… Oh man, I kind of want to do an Attune group action, because we’ve never seen people work together on magic, and that’s like my favorite magic trope.
Rhi: That—yeah.
Josie: I’d be down for that.
Kim: I would Love to lead that, that would make me very happy, however I only have 4 stress to spare.
Minna: I have stress to spare. I feel like I could stand back and be like the eyes that are helping you be the hands, if that makes sense.
Rhi: All right.
Kim: If you’re okay with leading I’m good with doing a group Attune, because that just makes my heart sing, because usually I’m the only one rolling Attune.
Rhi: Yeah! Do it. This is very cool. This is risky, standard effect for all of you.
Minna: Is there a Devil’s Bargain?
Rhi: Oh yeah. You can do Devil’s Bargain with just about anything. Let me think…
Kim: I rolled a 4.
Josie: I rolled a 2.
Rhi: Okay, and Myra is waiting to roll until I can make her an offer… Um, okay, I’ll go with this. Myra, you’re gonna take level 1 harm, just like psychic strain, because you are kind of serving as the focus point of this group thing.
Minna: Yeah, I’ll take that. I think that’s actually really cool.
Rhi: Yeah. So, go ahead and make your roll, Myra. So far we have a 2 and a 4.
Minna: So, it’s a 4.
Rhi: You do it, but there’s a consequence. I will get to the consequence. Tell me how this looks. How does this work?
Minna: Do you want to describe it? Do you want me to describe it? Do you want to take turns?
Rhi: Yeah, let’s have each of you kind of take turns. What does it look like for each of you? You successfully are gonna be able to de-power these wards. Each of you just kind of tell me how you contribute to it.
Minna: Ooh. Can it almost be like a psychic link-up thing?
Kim: That’s kind of what I’m imagining. I’m imagining something like that, and also Blaire’s probably muttering under her breath some sort of incantation.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I think Minx is providing the physical support, because I don’t know how tall this wall is, so I’m gonna give Blaire a boost to get there because she can’t reach it. [laughs]
Minna: I think in the ghost field there are lines that have snapped to tension between the three of them almost in a triangle.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s cool. So yeah, you all are able to de-power these wards.
Minna: I think that Myra can see patterns from back where she’s standing and then Blaire almost picks them apart like they’re…
Kim: Yeah, it’s almost like a puzzle to her, yeah, and she’s very used to doing this.
Minna: Yeah, somewhere between a puzzle and like strings.
Kim: Coming from her alchemy background, this is something that she’s very versed in.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah, whereas Myra’s learning a lot very quickly. Heh.
Rhi: The complication that I’m doing there is I’m ticking up the clock on the guards. We’re at 2 out of 4 there. So, you’ve taken down the arcane wards.
Minna: How do we take down spark-craft wards?
Kim: With magic and electricity.
Rhi: Yeah. Tinkering, or wrecking, or…
Josie: Yeah. Oh! I can do wrecking. I’m really good at wrecking.
Rhi: Wrecking is not subtle and has the potential to be loud.
Josie: Yeah. Right.
Rhi: So, just keep that in mind.
Josie: Which is potentially problematic, but I do have two dots in it.
Rhi: So, this is gonna continue to be risky, standard effect. Actually, it might be—because you don’t have fine wrecking tools, do you?
Josie: Uh, no.
Rhi: No. You have regular ones. It’s gonna be reduced effect.
Josie: Okay. I can push myself to increase effect, yes?
Rhi: Yes you can.
Josie: That’ll put me up to a lot of stress way quickly, though. Is anyone willing to assist me in wrecking this shit? [chuckles]
Minna: You know what, I’ll do that, because I really want this to work.
Josie: I will just use it for an extra die, increase our odds of a 6 or a critical or whatever. Minx kind of takes a look back there and just starts carefully looking for the spot to start and then is just sort of unraveling it very quickly, like she’s unraveling a scarf or something, all the wires.
Rhi: Yeah. All right, let’s see how this goes.
Josie: Uh, 5s.
Rhi: So it’s reduced effect, so you’re not quite gonna get it on this go-round, you’re gonna have to try it again.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I’m gonna give you an offer. I’m pretty sure I know what you’re gonna choose, but I’m still gonna make the offer. Would you like me to tick up the clock or would you like to get electrocuted?
Josie: I think it’s funnier if I get zapped. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, that’s gonna be level 2 harm.
Josie: Level 2 harm?! Okay. Oof.
Rhi: You get zinged real bad.
Josie: But Prowess resist, right?
Rhi: Yeah, Prowess to resist.
Josie: I am going to Prowess resist. So, that’s a 5.
Rhi: Five. Okay, so you take 1 point of stress and that’ll drop it down to level 1 harm, Zapped, instead of Electrocuted. But yeah, Minx is just stripping wires and is just all of a sudden, ZZT.
Josie: The hair in her bun kind of flays out a little bit. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Minx! You okay?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I’m fine dear, just don’t touch me yet. Some of the static needs to disperse.
Kim (as Blaire): [nervous] Uh, okay…
Josie (as Minx): I’m good to keep going. I’m good to keep going.
Rhi: Yeah, so give it another shot.
Josie: All right. I got a 6.
Rhi: All right, nice. So yeah, now that you got about half way through it you’re able to be like “oh, okay, I see how this is put together,” more or less, and you’re able to pry the whole system apart. It’s sparking a lot. There’s a faint smell of smoke.
Minna: We might burn this house down after all.
Josie: Huzzah.
Rhi: Yeah. You might set a fire after all.
Kim: Ba-dum-bum!
Rhi: But so far it’s okay, like the alarm hasn’t gone off, guards aren’t getting any closer. Yeah, the wards are down, the spark-craft alarm is down, you just have two locks, there’s a combination lock and a key lock.
Josie: All right. Do we want to try to Tinker these or just Wreck some more?
Kim: I would like to try tinkering first, and I have an idea. Would looking into the ghost field for the combination lock give me an idea of its history?
Rhi: I think that was—
Minna: That was—Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. That was Minna’s idea.
Minna: Let’s do it!
Josie: Yeah. Ghost fingerprints. [laughs]
Rhi: To look and see if you can figure out what the combination is?
Kim: Yeah. All right, so I’m gonna roll Attune for this. All right, 6.
Rhi: Shit. All right. Yeah. I mean, that does it, yeah. You just need that 6. Yeah, so you look into the ghost field and it’s like this overlay, the same figure coming down the stairs, walking over to the vault, and entering a combination. I’m gonna roll. All the numbers are gonna be 6 or lower.
Minna: [giggles] Perfect.
Rhi: Enters 6, 3, 2, 3…
Kim (as Blaire): Oh!
Rhi: …on the combination lock. You can just see this, it’s an overlay of every single time that this guy has done this.
Minna: Because it’s like a constant movement, so it’s warn like a path in the ghost field.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Exactly.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna take her spirit mask off.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, so, I got the combination, guys.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent, dear. Let’s put that in.
Kim: All right!
Rhi: All right. You hear a CLUNK as something in the door unlocks.
Minna (as Myra): One more.
Josie: Do you wish to attempt tinkering at it or shall I just strip it down?
Kim: I say tinker first, and if that doesn’t work then maybe wreck it?
Josie: Very well.
Rhi: So yeah, go ahead and do your roll. Risky, reduced effect, because this is a real good lock.
Kim: Five.
Rhi: Five, okay. But consequence…
Kim: [groans nervously]
Rhi: Tick, tick, tick. We’re at 3 out of 4, but you’re at reduced effect though, so the lock isn’t open. You gotta do one more. You get a 4, 5, or a 6, the lock is open.
Kim: And if I don’t the clock’s gonna be complete.
Rhi: You have a 50% chance of opening this lock.
Kim: I still don’t like those odds.
Josie: I think I will assist you.
Kim: Are you sure?
Josie: Yes. It will leave me with 2 stress remaining, but for… The next score is gonna be mostly combat, and I am skilled at that.
Kim: So long as you don’t get fucked up because you assisted me.
Josie: I mean, I’m willing to take the risk.
Rhi: [hums innocently]
Minna: [giggles] In character.
Kim: Phew. All right, that’s a 5 and a 6.
Rhi: Okay!
Kim: Josie, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Rhi: You feel something click in the lock and then there’s another CHUNK as some other lock disengages, and Blaire, you can like spin the wheel and the vault slowly opens.
Minna (as Myra): [smiling] Blaire, you are a marvel.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s all luck, baby, it’s all luck.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Hey now. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. So, you’re in this guy’s vault where he has these journals.
Minna: Does he also have some like shit we can steal?
Rhi: He’s got some shit y’all can steal! [laughs]
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Fuck yeah~! We’re gonna make some coin tonight, baby!
Minna: I was gonna say, we are poor.
Rhi: Huh… I’m trying to think of how I want to… Somebody is gonna need to roll to locate these journals. I think I’m gonna have each of you roll Study or Survey, but more of a Gather Info roll, and that’ll tell me how much coin you’re each able to grab.
Kim: Okay.
Josie: Okay. So, no consequences is what you’re saying?
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a fortune roll basically is what I’m having that be, literally a fortune roll. Ew, now I’m mad at myself. Why did I make that joke?
Kim: Okay, I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay, so—
Minna: I got a 4 on the look for the journal Study.
Rhi: I thought Minx was looking for the journals.
Minna: Oh! Okay. Then that’s a 4 on the fortune roll.
Rhi: Okay. Each of you—because you’re having to do this fast—Blaire and Myra, you each nab 2 coin worth of stuff, small valuables that you’re shoving into pockets. Minx, go ahead and give me a roll for Survey or Study, however you’re collecting.
Josie: I did that. I got a 5.
Rhi: So, Minx finds the journals, Blaire and Myra grab about 4 coin worth of stuff, but Josie did not get a 6. Household Guards, 4 out of 4. You all have raided this vault. You’ve gotten the journals that you were sent for. You’ve grabbed some coin.
Minna: We left a pin.
Rhi: This is—Did you leave a pin?
Kim: I think we did for this one.
Minna: I feel like we left a pin.
Rhi: Yeah, just sitting in the middle of the vault.
Kim: Probably.
Minna: Yeah, in one of the empty spaces we took shit from.
Rhi: Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.
Kim: That’s awesome.
Rhi: –have left a pin behind. However, as you step out of the vault you hear shouting and running from above you as the guards are rushing for the stairs to the vault.
Josie: I wanna be off to the side, around the corner from the stairs. You know what, I’m gonna commit to having a pistol and a sword, one in each hand.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Very on brand.
Minna: You swashbuckler, you.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: What are the other two of you doing?
Kim: I’m going to mark the lightning hooks off of my equipment. That’s just the closest thing to a weapon that I usually have on me.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, you’ve fried many people with those. All right. Where are you gonna post up?
Kim: Probably to the right of Minx, and I’m gonna let Minx take the lead, I would imagine.
Rhi: Yes, and Myra?
Minna: Probably a pistol and a dagger. That’s always a good idea.
Rhi: Yeah, just make sure you—
Josie: Are we able to hear how many are coming?
Rhi: More than two? Probably less than six? Probably? It’s hard to tell. You can just hear running and shouting, some indistinct number of voices.
Josie: Okay. If it’s a small number we might be able to intimidate them. I think we’re just going in for the fight at this point, though.
Rhi: Yeah. You left the door up there cracked open so that you’d be able to leave. You hear it slam open, and you hear footsteps coming down the stairs, but they don’t fully rush down onto the landing. They kind of slow and stop, and then two guards step out onto the landing with basically shotguns and just sweep the room to look, and since you’re all around the corner they don’t see you immediately.
Josie: Okay. I want to lash out with my sword around the corner and then just cut at the ankles of the first guy.
Rhi: Okay. This is gonna be risky, standard effect.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Six. Cool. So you slash across the front of his ankles and he cries out in pain and stumbles forward and is losing his footing as he’s suddenly bleeding heavily from near the feet. Myra, I think you’ll also have, since that was just a 6, there’s no consequence to that roll, you can also act.
Minna: I also got a 6.
Rhi: Nice!
Josie: Ooh!
Rhi: Teamwork makes the dream work.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yay. How do you take out the other guard? She also has a shotgun.
Minna: I feel like they’re ambushed enough that I’m able to grab her around the middle and, like, stab.
Kim: Just do a stab?
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Yeah. I think it’s like a grabs her around the middle, goes for the kidneys.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, she goes down, and then the other two who had been behind on the stairs come rushing in.
Minna: And she’s a stumbling block now.
Rhi: Yeah, there’s two people on the ground in various states of pain and blood. Two of you have kind of lost the element of surprise, you’re out in the open now as these other two come running down with pistols, but Blaire is still a little bit hidden.
Kim: So, one of the guards are definitely taken care of, correct? And one is still—
Rhi: Two of them are down. Two are down, two are still up. Fifty percent of the guards were eliminated in the first ambush. Nice job.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: So, is it possible for me to try and sneak up on one of them and use my lightning hooks on one?
Rhi: Yeah. It’s not gonna be a ton of sneaking. It’s just you’re jumping out from your ambush position and…
Kim: So would that be a Skirmish?
Rhi: Yeah, zapping them. Risky position. They’re fine lightning hooks, right?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Greater effect.
Kim: That’s a 4.
Rhi: Four, okay. You jump on one of the guards and there’s electricity flying and sparking. The last guard who’s up… like, this all happened in the span of about five seconds.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: None of them even got a single shot off. You all just bam-bam-bam, took three of them out. The last guard looks at the situation, turns around and runs.
Josie: [laughs] yay.
Kim: Oh, hell no.
Minna: Sounds like a good time for someone to use a gun.
Rhi: Yeah, I was gonna say. Here’s the thing, there’s a lot of Bluecoat patrols in the area.
Josie: Yeah. I’m gonna fire my pistol in pursuit.
Kim: [nervous noises]
Rhi: Okay. Do it. Nope, already happening.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: [laughs] Minx is reckless.
Josie: Also, we’re in a basement. Who’s gonna fucking hear?
Kim: It’s also a gun.
Rhi: Yeah. They are running back up the stairs to the first floor.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Five, okay. I’m gonna say it’s reduced effect. The shot hits them in the arm. They stumble but keep running and make it up to the first floor, and are at the moment out of your sight.
Josie: Okay. I vote we also just bolt, get out of here, not a prolonged fight.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Just make a run for it? Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Out the back.
Kim: I’m fine with that.
## Escape [0:21:07]
Rhi: All right. So, you all are able to run up and out of the house without any issue. Minx, you use your knowledge of the Bluecoat patrols to kind of like, instead of—it’s like, okay, we can’t go down this street, we’ll go down this way, we’ll dodge the Bluecoats. However, as you’re making your way through Brightstone having to kind of dodge to the shadows, because you all look pretty sketchy right now, you start hearing the ringing of the Bluecoat alarm bells.
Josie: Right.
Kim: Ugh.
Rhi: And… Let me look up how this works.
Minna: “Let me look up how this works” is ominous.
Rhi: Shh… It’s fine. Everything’s fine. This is just something I’ve never gotten to do before… Okay! So, we are going to have a chase scene.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim & Josie: Oh!
Rhi: Which means I’m gonna use racing clocks.
Minna: [bright-smile gasp]
Josie: Ooh.
Kim: Ohh~!
Rhi: So, “Create two opposed clocks to represent a race. The PCs might have a clock called Escape while the Bluecoats have a clock called Cornered,” which is the clocks that you two will have. The Bluecoats have been alerted by that surviving guard that this house was just robbed. The Bluecoats are fanning out across the district in pursuit of you. they have you outnumbered, so your clock is 6, theirs is 4. You all are gonna have to make a series of rolls to get out of Brightstone.
Josie: I propose we try to escape via our underground passages and the like.
Rhi: Yep, so all clocks are at 0 right now, Bluecoats are 0 out of 4, you all are at 0 out of 6. Start running.
Josie: Yep. Let’s run towards the nearest catacomb entrance.
Rhi: I think your first roll is gonna have to be somebody examining the maps as you’re sprinting to make sure you can find a place.
Josie: [laughs] Okay.
Kim: I know the catacombs pretty well. I’m okay with doing a Study as I run. Is that how that works?
Rhi: Okay. Yes.
Kim: Okay, so let me roll Study.
Rhi: Risky position.
Kim: Okay, 5.
Rhi: Five, okay. Yeah. I’m gonna tick both clocks up by 1.
Josie: Yeesh.
Rhi: You ID where the nearest catacomb entrance is. It’s not super close by, and the Bluecoats are getting closer.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: However, I have a question, is this catacomb entrance, you know, windy and maze-like and confusing enough that it’s feasible enough to have the Bluecoats’ trail be kind of thrown off?
Minna: Maybe another Study to try and find the best route through?
Rhi: Yeah. You can try to find that out.
Minna: I can do that.
Rhi: Okay. If you want to look at the maps of the underground passages to try to find a good route as you’re still sprinting.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Kim: Woo.
Rhi: Okay. Ticking both of them up another one a piece.
Minna: Uh-huh…
Kim: Ugh.
Josie: Egh…
Minna: Which means we’re 2 out of 4 on the Bluecoats and 2 out of 6 on ours.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah, that’s not good.
Josie: Can I take an action that’s intended to slow their clock rather than advance ours?
Minna: Wreck, wreck, wreck.
Rhi: I think you can do that.
Minna: Because I feel like if you did something that slowed them down, that would give us an advantage and we would move ahead. It’s like the pod racing philosophy.
Rhi: Yes. It wouldn’t necessarily reduce their clock, but it would boost you up further.
Josie: Right. Okay. I’m not gonna split the party, but I am gonna jog over like a block, fire some shots into the air, and then run back to where we are and try to essentially draw attention.
Rhi: Okay. I’m picturing it as like, you’re running on a street, Minx veers off through an alley, BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG, Minx veers off through the next alley and catches back up.
Josie: Yep. I want to throw them off the trail.
Rhi: Yeah. Go ahead and give me some kind of roll for that.
Josie: Could I make a case for Sway in that case?
Minna: It’s a deception.
Rhi: It is deception. Yeah, I’ll allow it.
Josie: Six.
Rhi: Yeah. That works very well. The Bluecoats who have been kind of like…
Josie: Oh, we’re up to 4? I thought we were up to 3.
Rhi: Nope, I’m gonna move you up to 4 because you got a 6. That was very good.
Josie: Cool. Neat.
Rhi: I’ve been advancing you by 1 when you get a, like, with a consequence. Okay. You hear, you know, you fire those gunshots and run back and you can kind of hear in the distance:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Move over to Silvermark! There’s gunshots! Move!
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Do you guys wanna do like… I don’t know. I feel like we need to do something good, because if we can get another 6 we can get away scot-free.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re getting closer to that catacomb entrance, but the Bluecoats are still in pursuit.
Kim: I have an idea. Because I still have plenty of load to spare, can I mark off, what would it be, probably an unusual weapon and have it be a smoke bomb or would that have to be a flashback?
Rhi: Smoke bombs we have established cost 1 stress. You get them from Seeks, and in a flashback, yeah, you have to have ducked out at some point to get those.
Kim: Yeah, doing that would put me at 3 stress left to spare, but if you just protect a squishy baby in the next score I might be okay.
Josie: That’s my intention. [laughs]
Rhi: You gonna have a smoke bomb?
Kim: I’m going to have a smoke bomb.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead and mark down that stress for that flashback.
Kim: yeah, and I mark off an unusual weapon?
Rhi: [laughs] Seeks is like:
Rhi (as Seeks): You all should really just start getting these in bulk.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): I know, I’m sorry, but I think we’re really gonna need this.
Rhi (as Seeks): No, I mean it’s fine, I like seeing you, but bulk would be much more practical.
Minna: [giggles] I love how she’s always advising us on finances.
Kim: Anyway. Do I have to roll anything to set this off?
Rhi: Yeah. Well, yes, you have to roll something, but tell me what you’re trying to do. Are you trying to…?
Kim: I’m trying to cover our tracks. As the three of us are running I want Blaire to, you know, set off the smoke bomb and throw it over her shoulder and just let it dissipate behind them so that way, you know, there’s just a fog that covers our escape.
Rhi: Can I make a counter suggestion?
Kim: Please.
Rhi: Because like, in an enclosed space that makes sense, but at this point having suddenly smoke in the street is gonna tell them exactly where you are.
Kim: True.
Rhi: So, counter suggestion, throw it through a window of a nearby house and they’ll think there’s a fire.
Kim: I do like that suggestion. Would that be Skirmish to toss that?
Rhi: Um… I feel like it’s more of a Wreck.
Minna: Or maybe a Hunt? For aim.
Rhi: Hunt could also work.
Kim: Could I make an argument for Finesse? Have it be something like I’m aiming for a certain window.
Rhi: Yes. I’ll allow Finesse.
Kim: Thank you! I have something in Finesse. I’m gonna roll one… Woo! Okay, that’s a 6.
Minna: [gasps]
Josie: Nice!
Rhi: Okay, nice. Yeah. I think you have to stop for a second to get really good aim, and then you just throw it in and it goes into a second floor window, and you can hear distant screaming as smoke starts billowing out that window.
Kim: Perfect. Yep.
Rhi: So, I mean, that’s gonna get you up to 6 out of 6.
Minna: Yeah~!
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: You all reach the catacomb entrance and rush in and make your way through the underground catacombs and canals out of Brightstone.
Kim: Oh my God.
Josie: Can we pop out right near the Daily? [laughs]
Rhi: Well, so here’s the thing. By the time you make your way, you kind of slow down and stop running after a little bit, by the time you make your way into Charterhall it’s 11, 11:30. The delivery is not until dawn.
Josie: Oh.
Rhi: So, you don’t have time for a full downtime of reducing stress.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: The thing is, you no longer have to necessarily hit this in Charterhall. You could hit this in Nightmarket where security’s a little lighter. You could go home and switch out your gear, I will let you kind of reset your load, you have enough time. You all did very well on that first house. You paid for it dearly in stress, but like… You actually probably, like, if you’re running back to Six Towers anyway you could drop this off with the Silver Nails.
Kim: You mean on the way?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah. Here you go. Bye. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, basically. You wanna do that?
Josie: Yeah, let’s do it.
Rhi: Okay. So I’m picturing that you all hustle in looking disheveled and like you just came off a score, like you’re armed and breathing hard, and at this point in the night the place is pretty busy. People kind of look up at you and are like, uh, be a little more subtle please. A couple of the Silver Nails make their way through the crowd over to you and are like:
Rhi (as Silver Nail): What do you… What do you need? Do you have the goods?
Josie (as Minx): We do. I apologize for the, [exhales] commotion, but there was that deadline. Here you go.
Rhi (as Silver Nail): You weren’t followed, were you?
Rhi: They take the journals.
Kim (as Blaire): No. We made sure of that.
Rhi (as Silver Nail): All right. Well…
I think one of them looks out over the crowd.
Rhi (as Silver Nail): TUHAN!
Rhi: And there’s a pause as she makes her way over.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Oh, hey, all right. You made it back. Cutting it a little fine, but well done.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi: Kind of props one of the books up on her amputated arm, is balancing it on that, and then uses her other hand to page through it.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Yeah, these are them. All right.
Rhi: Hands it back to the person who took them originally.
Rhi (as Tuhan): All right. Well, you kept your end of the deal. We’re square.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Excellent. Thank you. Now excuse us, we need to take a short rest.
Rhi (as Tuhan): Do you want to have a drink—
Rhi: And they’re gone. Okay. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Normally we’d love to, but we got other things to do. Bye~!
Minna: Myra waves.
Rhi: Yeah. Tuhan just shrugs and then they head off to look over their new gains. So yeah, you all are able to zip back to The Nest, put away your newly gained coin, I assume 1 for each of you and 1 into the vault probably. We’ll sort that out during downtime.
Minna: God, this is the most coin I’ve had in my pocket in ages.
Rhi: You get back to The nest. It’s about midnight. You don’t really have enough time to kind of distress and decompress that much, but you can change out your gear, you have a snack, maybe have some tea to caffeinate a little bit. [laughs]
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Blaire definitely has tea.
Minna: Rebraid my hair.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Oh yes. I need to unzap my hair. [laughs]
Kim: Reapply your lipstick.
Josie: Minx gets into The Nest and just doesn’t really slow down. She’s just in and out of her room fixing herself up. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. And then I think at about 4 AM is when you all have to head out again.
Josie: All right. What are the down sides of a heavy load again?
Rhi: You are very obviously armed and armored. It’s not subtle.
Josie: Okay. I think I’m gonna switch to a heavy load. Minx is just not taking any chances and going out in full combat gear.
Rhi: Okay. How about everybody else?
Kim: I’m gonna stick with my normal load.
Minna: Same.
Rhi: Normal, normal. Okay, so heavy, normal, normal.
Minna: Because I don’t actually end up using that much of my load during most scores.
Kim: Same.
Minna: Normal is sufficient.
## Preparation [0:33:22]
Rhi: You said this was going to be an Assault score.
Josie: Yep ,that makes sense.
Kim: It’s gotta be.
Rhi: Where are you attacking? Because you don’t necessarily have to hit them in Charterhall.
Josie: That’s true, but that’s where we know they’re gonna be.
Kim: But I also like the idea of Nightmarket because of the lowered security.
Minna: Yeah. Let’s hit them in our home turf.
Kim: Exactly.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Oh my God. We could use that mechanic that no one ever remembers.
Kim: Which is?
Josie: Oh yeah. Let’s do that.
Minna: Ooh. What is it?
Rhi: It’s the Turf mechanic, where you get bonuses if you’re doing a score on your turf.
Josie: Yeah. Let’s like catch them at one of the bridges leading out so we just bottleneck them.
Rhi: Yeah, so a bridge out of Nightmarket is your… Yeah, that’ll work perfectly. There’s actually a bridge—Oh! I know exactly what bridge you’re gonna hit. It’s the one… Is that right? I feel like this might be… Yeah. I think this is the bridge right next to Hagen’s clinic, actually.
Minna: Ooh.
Kim: Oh. Okay.
Rhi: So you all have been around here before. This is familiar ground. So, we’re gonna do our second engagement roll!
Kim: Christ.
Josie: Hurray.
Kim: This is bonkers.
Rhi: Luck? I would say again this is bold or daring.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: “Does the plan’s detail expose a vulnerability of the target?” I think so. I think that bottlenecking them on a bridge is a good plan. Nobody’s providing aid or insight. Nobody’s interfering. Um, I think this is a higher tier target… so, 2d6 and I’m taking the higher. Phew, good thing for that, because I got a 1 and a 6.
Minna: Yeah!
Josie: Nice.
Kim: Nice!
## Score 2 [0:35:05]
Rhi: You are gonna be in a controlled position. You all have enough time to get over there and setup your ambush zone, so each of you tell me what you do to setup this ambush.
Josie: I want to put something blocking part of the bridge in some way.
Minna: I actually have an idea. Is there something that might foul or slow cart wheels?
Rhi: The cart wheels, not necessarily, but they’re drawn by goats. You could put something down that’ll hurt the goats that’ll stop ‘em dead.
Minna: [whining] I don’t wanna hurt the goats.
Rhi: You may have to hurt the goats. [chuckles]
Josie: Caltrops.
Rhi: Or, I mean, if you did some kind of… It’s not like this is a car where you can put down a strip of nails and blow out the tire, but if you put down some kind of oil slick that would send everything skidding…
Minna: Yeah, that’s what I was thinking. Actually, I have an idea. Okay, cart wheels, circles with spokes, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: If you had sort of like some kind of stake setup that might catch them crosswise and catch in the spokes.
Rhi: Yeah. You could try to setup something like that.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Although, I kind of like the oil slick idea.
Minna: Whatever you wanna do. Something. I just wanted to toss ideas around.
Kim: I have an additional idea. Is it possible, is there any way that I could go about trying to extinguish the lamps near the bridge?
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: Oh, absolutely.
Kim: Okay, then I’m definitely doing that to make it darker.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay.
Minna: I do like oil combined with that. Also, oil, potentially flammable. Good asset.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughing] Just in case, as the last ditch effort.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Or, something goes horribly wrong and I can set all of you on fire.
Kim: Don’t! Don’t.
Minna: Oh my God. We could literally burn a bridge.
Josie: [laughs] It’s fine.
Kim: Was that an X-Card don’t, or just a please don’t set us on fire as a general plea?
Kim: Please don’t set us on fire. If I were to do an X-Card I would, you know, actually type it out in the chat.
Rhi: Okay. I just wanted to check.
Kim: No, I’m okay, fire is fine.
Rhi: Okay! Myra’s putting down an oil slick on the bridge. Blaire is putting out the lights. Minx, what are you doing?
Josie: I think I’m just gonna be ready. Yeah. I’m just gonna be ready.
Minna: You’re the one who says stand and deliver.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yes. Yeah, I’m gonna be the one who actually goes in and holds them up at gunpoint.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Should I mark off a lantern in my load for the oil?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: That would make sense.
Rhi: Yes it would.
Kim: And do I have to roll anything to extinguish the lamps?
Rhi: I’m gonna say no. You all get there with enough time that you are able to just climb up the lamppost. Minx is probably giving you boosts to scramble up there.
Kim: Yeah, because I am a smol.
Rhi: To just extinguish the… well, disconnecting them, because these are all electroplasm powered.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So yeah, the bridge is dark…
Kim: Perfect.
Rhi: …you got a nice oil slick, you all are just kind of waiting, and then you hear hoof beats and wheels. There’s just kind of the faintest glow of sunlight in the sky. It’s been a real long day.
Minna: Is it that one that happens only at like dawn and twilight?
Rhi: Yeah. You only see the sun at dawn and sunset. The sky is just barely beginning to lighten, and this carriage being pulled by two giant Akorosian goats comes on. The carriage itself is more heavily reinforced than your average carriage, but it is not an armored carriage. There’s a driver and someone sitting next to her with a rifle across their knees, and you’re able to see two figures kind of hanging on to the back of the carriage, and which point the carriage hits the oil slick, there’s loud bleating as the goats go scrambling and stumbling as the carriage veers wildly.
Josie: Baa.
Kim: Baa~!
Rhi: I think the… Hmm. I think on a critical you would have tipped the carriage. I think in this case the carriage has come to a stop, and I think the two guards on the back got thrown off, so they are not out of the fight but they’re like down on the ground and kind of scrambling to recover themselves.
Minna: And sliding.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, they’re slipping in the oil, they’re scrambling to recover.
Josie: All right. I’m gonna have my trusty blunderbuss.
Rhi: Uh-huh?
Josie: I think I’m gonna get right up on the side of the carriage as it skids to a stop, just point it in the face of the two people there.
Josie (as Minx): Now is a good time to take a day off.
Rhi: Roll me something.
Josie: Yeah. That’s probably Command?
Rhi: Yeah. You’re in a controlled position.
Josie: I got a 6, though.
Rhi: So I think the two of them look at you and your very large gun, they look at each other, they look back at you. The driver just kinda goes…
Rhi (as Driver): Just don’t shoot my goats.
Rhi: …and slides down…
Minna: Aww.
Rhi: …and is just ignoring you now and is trying to get her goats disentangled.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Baa. Baa. Baa.
Rhi: The other guard just kind of tosses his rifle onto the seat and slides down.
Rhi (as Guard): I don’t get paid enough for this.
Rhi: Just walks off to the side of the bridge, sits down with his hands behind his head.
Josie: Good idea.
Rhi: [laughing] You get the impression he’s been robbed before.
Kim: This is amazing. This is very good.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Good show.
Josie: I’m gonna just gently pat the butt of one of the goats.
Rhi: [angry goat noise, laughs]
Kim: Can I kiss one? I’m gonna kiss a goat.
Rhi: Please—No, you can’t. They’re very upset. They’re very large.
Minna: You’re in the middle of a score!
Rhi: Yeah, you’re in the middle of a score. Please focus. The score is not done. There are still at least to guards who have not been pacified.
Kim: Can I pet one goat?!
Rhi: … Yes. The goat doesn’t like it. The goat’s stressed out.
Kim: Okay!
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: All right. I’m gonna levy my blunderbuss at the two guards who fell off and kind of nod at you two to actually go in and get the stuff.
Rhi: Yeah, so Blaire and Myra, you I think will need to do, again, some kind of rolls.
Minna: Skirmish?
Rhi: Yeah. It’s still controlled. That has not dropped yet. Each of you can do Skirmish.
Minna: Six.
Kim: Four.
Rhi: Jesus. Okay. So, Myra, I think that the guard you walk towards, her gun had skidded pretty far away, so she’s not even close when you pick it up. Blaire, your guard, his gun didn’t go as far, so you two I think both grab it at the same time and there’s a little bit of a struggle, and I think he wrenches it around and hits you in the side of the face with the butt of the gun.
Kim: Ugh.
Rhi: So you are gonna take level 1 harm, Bruised Jaw.
Kim: Okay. That’s two slots of level 1 harm.
Rhi: So yeah, you’re wrestling with that, he hits you in the face with the gun, I think you kick him in the stomach and he lets go and you get his gun. So you’ve disarmed those guards.
Minna: I like that you say those guards, implying there are more.
Rhi: [cheerfully] Yeah. You haven’t checked inside the carriage yet.
Josie: Yes. All right. I’m gonna point my gun at the door to the carriage.
Josie (as Minx): Can one of you grab the handle?
Minna: Myra opens it, like a footman opening it for a noble.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] So Minx, you and the guard inside have very similar guns, like you probably bought them from the same gun maker.
Josie: Oh. [laughs] Excellent.
Rhi: That identical gun is being aimed at you.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I’m just gonna fire.
Rhi: Okay. Roll it. This is gonna be risky, because you do have a gun being aimed at you.
Josie: I do get a 6, though.
Rhi: Okay. Uh… So, yeah—
Josie: That’s three 6s in a row.
## Content Warning: gore [0:43:40] Skip to next tag
Rhi: Yeah. You fire into the carriage. You… There’s chunks of this guy all over the inside of the carriage.
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: I mean, you fired basically a shotgun at pretty close range.
Kim: Yeah…
Josie: Yeah, and I mean, he was gonna do the same to me, so…
Kim: Yeah, but still, yuck. Ick.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: He is very dead. There is prolonged, horrified screaming coming from inside the carriage.
Kim: [deep breath]
Josie: I’m gonna poke my head in and put a handkerchief over my mouth.
Rhi: There is a woman in fairly nice clothes, or at least they were nice before they got covered in guard bits, who is just screaming, and sitting next to her is a package of papers that are kind of tied up with twine.
Josie: I’m gonna pick up the sheath of papers, put it away, and then hand her my handkerchief.
Rhi: She doesn’t react. She’s just like, totally… She just saw a man get blown to pieces in front of her. She’s kind of having a meltdown.
## Content Warning ends [0:44:57]
Minna: [whispering] Ask her if there are copies.
Josie (as Minx): Now dear, I don’t suppose there are copies of this?
Rhi: You’re gonna have to roll something and you’re gonna be at reduced effect.
Josie: I’m gonna roll Sway. I got a 5.
Rhi: Huh… Did she make copies? Let’s find out… She didn’t make copies. She’s not very bright.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: So, she manages to calm down long enough to be like:
Rhi (as Woman): [frantic] And-No! No, I didn’t make any copies!
Josie (as Minx): Good. Good. Now, just remember this is how playing games like this generally turns out.
Josie: I’m gonna wave the sheaf at her and hop off.
Rhi: Okay. The consequence here is that in the process of climbing into the carriage, Minx, you also got kind of covered in blood…
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: …and you all hear the death bell tolling.
Kim: Oh no~!
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Josie: Right.
Rhi: As you look up into the—normally you can’t see the deathseeker crows very clearly, because they’re black on the black sky, but it’s light enough that you can see them taking off from Charterhall, which isn’t very far away, and they’re starting to circle.
Josie: Well, good thing we didn’t do this there then. Time to go home, dears.
Rhi: Yeah. So, um, I think I’m gonna need one last roll to see if you leave any kind of a trail.
Josie: Does anyone have the stress to handle a group action?
Minna: Yes.
Josie: Okay. I think we should do a group Prowl or something.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: I agree.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky.
Josie: I got a 4.
Kim: I got a 6.
Minna: I also got a 6.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I take 0 stress.
Rhi: No stress.
Kim: Dang.
Rhi: So, you hurry off. I think that the way that you have to—I was gonna say that Minx is leaving a little bit of a blood trail along behind her, but I think what you all do is you duck around the bridge and Minx has to ditch her coat, just toss it in the river, and then you all take kind of a roundabout route home, and as you keep kind of glancing back towards the sky you can see the crows circling in tighter and tighter on the bridge where you all were, but you make it back to The Nest okay.
Minna: Can I give us a shot for after, for like the scene right after we get back to The Nest?
Rhi: Absolutely.
Minna: I think we see them all huddled around the fireplace—I assume there’s a fireplace? I don’t know.
Rhi: Yeah. Sure.
Minna: And merrily burning in the grate is the blackmail material.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yes. [laughs]
Rhi: Did you look at it at all?
Josie: Nah.
Kim: No.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so the three of you sit around the fire watching as the blackmail material burns and are just like, okay, time for a nap.
Kim: Blaire is definitely slumped up against the two of you and is already zonked out.
Others: Aww~!
Minna: Group fall asleep by the fire.
Josie: Group cuddle.

"Season 2, Episode 17: The Defense Attorneys Score, Part 1 Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly.
##Intro
Rhi: welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. Special shout-out to the fine folks who have been recommending the show on Twitter lately. We’ve been tagged in a lot of podcast rec tweets recently and it’s really great to see our fans bringing in new listeners. That’s just one of many ways that you can support the show. Leaving reviews and supporting us on Patreon are other awesome ways to help us reach more people and do more great things.
Minna and I will be at Gen Con in August, which is approaching very quickly. I’ll be moderating a panel on Thursday morning, ‘So You Want To Start An AP Podcast?’ Swing by and check it out, and get a Magpies bookmark while you’re there. Even further in the future, I will be at AcadeCon in November. I’m running a game of Blades in the Dark, and I’ll be handing out even more Magpies bookmarks. Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Kim: Styles 4 Kidz is a Chicago-based organisation that provides education to multi-racial and adoptive families on how to style and care for black natural hair. Their salon offers a safe and judgement-free zone for parents to learn about their child’s hair, teaches them the skills they need, and recommends them hair care products meant for afro-textured hair. They also provide services to children living in residential facilities and detention centres, and children with special needs. To sponsor a child, or to donate, visit www.styles4kidz.org.
Rhi: In addition, for our American listeners, please continue to call your representatives and demand that the house begin an impeachment inquiry. Call your local city and county governments to demand that they refuse to cooperate with ICE and donate to immigrant defence organisations like RAICES if you’re able.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## Story continues [00.02.06]
Rhi: So I think it’s been a few days since your ‘Two Scores in One Night, Part Two’ expedition, where you did manage to keep two promises. You pulled off two scores in a single night and then took a nap.
Kim: Big nap.
Rhi: Yeah, big nap. Big, cuddle-pile nap.
Minna: I feel like two scores, one night is becoming, like, our specialty.
Rhi: You’re getting there. So, you know, it’s been a few days since that happened. You have checked back in at The Hound’s Paw to collect your messages, I imagine at this point you’re doing that a little more frequently, and you have a message from Lani and Roxanne, who have asked to meet with you. The note is vague, but it basically says that they have found some information on that project you’d asked them to work on.
Minna: Hmm.
Josie: Ooh.
Kim: Which project?
Rhi: Basically try to confirm the identities of the other members of The Circle of Flame.
Kim: Oh, yes.
Rhi: You know who some of them are, you had suspicions about a couple people, so they have been doing that research for you. And apparently, they have turned up something.
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: So I think that probably you’re just, again, gonna head over to their apartment. I introduced it and then you’ve gone there, like, every episode since.
Kim: It’s a good gay apartment.
Rhi: You make your way up to the docks, and as you’re heading through the docks area, you can tell that things have taken a bad turn around here. There is a lot of damage to buildings, there have been fires, there are broken windows. The Lampblacks who were patrolling the streets, they’re moving in larger groups. Like, previously they were moving in groups of two or three, now they’re moving in groups of four and five and are very openly armed. But there are fewer groups. And some of the people that you see moving around look like, you know, they’ve got bruises and black eyes.
Minna: Are there, like, random citizens around?
Rhi: Yeah, there’s the regular dock workers, people on the docks.
Minna: I kinda wanna just, like, stop and ask somebody:
Minna (as Myra): Is somebody moving in on The Lampblacks’ territory here?
Rhi (as Passer-By): Yeah, you haven’t heard? It’s some old gang that, I dunno, got a bug up their ass and is trying to take the docks.
Minna (as Myra): Old gang?
Rhi (as Passer-By): Erm, what are they… the umbra-somethings?
Minna (as Myra): Hunters. The hunters?
Rhi (as Passer-By): Yeah, yeah. Umbra Hunters.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs]
Rhi (as Passer-By): Yeah, they apparently fell apart some years ago and, I dunno, new management, maybe? But, they’re scrapping with the Lampblacks and good on them, I say. I don’t think The Lampblacks have been very good for this area, if you ask me.
Minna (as Myra): I doubt The Umbra Hunters will be any better.
Rhi (as Passer-By): Mm. You’re probably right.
Rhi: [laughs] Just, sort of, frowns thoughtfully.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: For the most part, there’s been a lot of property damage, but it does not look like the citizens of the docks have been physically attacked. For the most part.
Kim: Mm. Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. Like, their buildings are getting destroyed in this conflict, but it seems like either The Lampblacks and Umbra Hunters have some scruples, and are trying not to involve civilians, or, more likely, the people of the docks know when to duck and cover.
Minna and Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: I do not have any alchemical solutions for broken buildings, unfortunately.
Rhi: So, you’re making your way through the docks. And, you know, as you’re heading towards Lani and Roxanne’s building, you hear very distantly, probably on the other side of the district, gunfire breaking out. Could be nothing, could be some kinda scrap between The Lampblacks and The Umbra Hunters, you’re not sure. You head into their building, head upstairs, and Lani lets you in and as soon as the door is shut begins signing very rapidly and excitedly. And Roxanne is like:
Rhi (as Roxanne): Slow down, slow down.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: She signs at her to be like:
Rhi (as Roxanne): I can’t keep up, you’re talking too fast.
Rhi: They sit you down and get you some tea. You’re all crowded around this table that like, it’s a table that would be comfortably cosy with three people, and there’s five of you at it. So, you’re a little squished in.
Kim: Squishu.
Rhi: Yeah. They have a bunch of, like, papers spread out and Lani starts explaining what they’ve found. And what they have found is a confirmation that Lord Alistair Mora is involved in The Circle of Flame.
Minna: Mm!
Rhi: Some connections that are, you know, it wouldn’t hold up in court. But, it’s good enough for your purposes, that it seems like he is almost certainly a confirmed member of the group. And they continue on to explain that as they were researching Lord Mora, they uncovered some of his other activities. If you remember back at the end of Season One, he was planning to open up a weapons production factory in the docks.
Minna: Mm-hmm, the one with the dorms.
Rhi: And you all shut that down. But apparently he still has his hands in various types of weapons dealing, except now he’s doing it less than legally. He apparently has kind of a, like, gun-running side business, smuggling weapons to The Grinders. Which is, The Grinders is kind of–
Kim: Are they gay?
Rhi: They’re a gang–
Kim: No, I said are they gay?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Some of them probably are, but they’re not, like…
Kim: Rhi, you’re missing the joke.
Rhi: Oh, I get it. Yeah. No, I get it now, it took me a second.
Kim: [giggles]
Rhi: [sighs]
Minna: I mean, I was thinking are they sandwiches.
Rhi: [bigger sigh]
Josie: I mean, nothing’s stopping gay sandwiches.
Rhi: I’m just gonna stare into the middle distance sadly for a little bit.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Until the puns end. I’m sorry.
[laughter]
Rhi: No, I know that if I just let you all keep going, they won’t stop. So, The Grinders are actually, some of them are probably gay, some of them probably enjoy a good sandwich, all of them are Skovlan revolutionaries.
Josie: But all of them swipe right.
Rhi: Always, yeah, for sure.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah, so they are Skovlan revolutionaries. Basically their main goals are they also do a lot of weapons dealing, and they’re funnelling weapons back to Skovlan to, like, back the revolution against the Empire there.
Josie: Ah.
Kim: Alright.
Rhi: So, Lani and Roxanne kind of explain what they’ve learned about his gun-running dealings, and then Lani reaches over and picks up a copy of The Duskwall Daily. It’s not the top headline on the paper, but it’s above the fold. There is a story about how one Inspector Gilbert Severin has been arrested on charges of fraud and corruption.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim: Oh…
Rhi: Lani taps his name and then signs
Rhi (as Lani): He was investigating Mora. He was looking into this gun-running connection. We actually got a little information from him.
Minna: Was Inspector Severin the one that we…
Rhi: He sure was! That’s the guy who was being blackmailed by Harvale Brogan because he is a ghost in a person. He is a possessor ghost who has won his way into the Inspectors, and this is a fairly big deal, because the Inspectors have a reputation for being untouchable. The Bluecoats, everybody knows that they take bribes and are corrupt. The Inspectors are supposed to be above that. And so, the fact that one of them has been apparently caught out wrapped up in some kind of corruption charges is a big deal.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear. Although, it seems pretty clear this is–
Minna (as Myra): A set-up?
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Lani nods vigorously and points at both of you like, ‘yup’. Now, the other thing that Roxanne points out in the article, if he is convicted, it would not only shut down his current investigation, but it would lead to a review of all of his recent cases. Including his arrest of Harvale Brogan.
Minna: [groans]
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): As much as I hate to admit it for a person like him, we may need to go to bat for him again.
Minna (as Myra): What do you mean, ‘a person like him’?
Rhi: Yeah, Lani and Roxanne also look confused and like, ‘what do you mean?’ Inspectors are usually pretty helpful.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, yes, he’s just a bit of an arse.
[laughter]
Rhi: They look at each other and shrug and Lani is like:
Rhi (as Lani): I thought he was very nice.
Josie (as Minx): I’m glad he was nice to you.
Minna (as Myra): He worked with us, and he does appear to have kept working against our enemies. Our mutual enemies now, it seems. I don’t know that we should let him go down for this, if we can avoid it.
Josie (as Minx): Oh no, we absolutely shouldn’t. If for no other reason than pragmatism. But, having such an obviously unlawful conviction of a seemingly dedicated Inspector would be bad also.
Minna (as Myra): Well, not un-corruptible, but…
Josie (as Minx): Eh.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): At least working towards the same ends as us.
Josie (as Minx): Right.
Kim (as Blaire): Still, I can’t believe that we’re actually gonna help a cop.
Rhi: [laughs] Thank you for giving me the summary for this episode when I post it.
Josie (as Minx): It does leave a bit of a dirty feeling.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re gonna have to do something big to, like, balance this out.
Rhi: Yeah. So, are there any other questions that you want to ask Lani and Roxanne while you’re here?
Josie: What are the specifics of the charge?
Rhi: He has been charged, basically, fraud and corruption are the broad charges. In specific, he’s accused of extortion, more or less. Taking bribes from merchants and nobles to drop investigations, or making people pay him off so that he won’t open up investigations into them. Because it’s like, you know, it’s the thing where if you’re the target of an investigation, even if you haven’t done anything wrong, just by association it damages your reputation.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: And apparently the article says that he was found with a hidden cache of drugs that had been picked up in, like, you know, arrests and gang raids, and a cache of weapons that were meant for the Inspectors and Bluecoats, that he was apparently selling.
Josie: I see. And who is the prosecution?
Rhi: The article is vague as to where the accusations came from. It’s just, sort of like, these things were discovered about an Inspector, isn’t this scandalous. They don’t really say who brought the charges.
Minna: Not a paper that cares very much about naming its sources, is it?
Rhi: Nah, I mean, you know, the Daily’s relationship with the truth is casual at best.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: There is, kind of, an implication that it was a result of an internal investigation. But, no one specifically is named as being behind it. What you do see is that the trial is going to be heard by magistrate Lady Rhonda Drake, who you know to be in The Circle of Flame.
Minna: Lady Drake was the one who was onto us when we were raiding Ironhook.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Right. That is an issue. If this trial is to happen, it needs to have a different judge presiding. Otherwise, this is even more of an obvious sham.
Rhi: Or there needs to be such solid evidence proving his innocence that if she still convicts him it casts doubt on her.
Josie: Right.
Minna: We basically need to find out more about the accusations and the evidence.
Josie: Right. Question about the court system in this world…
Rhi: Yeah!
Josie: Is it kind of what we’re familiar with? Judge and jury and cross-examination?
Rhi: No jury.
Josie: No jury. Okay.
Rhi: When you are accused of a crime in Duskwall, your case is heard by a magistrate. Magistrates are basically judges, they issue warrants, prosecute trials, assess evidence and pronounce judgements. There are no juries. It is a system where you get justice based on how much money you have and your social standing. If you are very rich, you can buy your way into innocence. And yeah, so the way that trials work is you have a prosecutor, a barrister in this case. This is what Jeren’s father does.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Ah.
Rhi: Who will argue the prosecution’s side. Often they are representing the city. Just sort of, in general, the way that we have, you know, the prosecutors representing the state in real life court cases. Defence lawyers are not, like, there are no public defenders. If you can afford one, you can have someone argue your case. Otherwise, you have to represent yourself.
Kim: That’s fucked.
Rhi: Which is where a lot of the, you know, your ability to receive justice is tied directly to how much money you have, comes from. Because if you have a lot of money you can hire a very good lawyer, if you don’t have any money, you’re having to argue your case.
Kim: God, this city sucks.
Rhi: It sucks so bad!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, yeah. That is how trials work in the city. I think Blaire is the only one in this group who is unfamiliar with it.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Minx and Myra have both done brief stints in jail in their youth, where, you know, they would have gone through very fast trials.
Minna: And Myra studied it.
Rhi: Yeah, so Myra is actually probably somewhat familiar with the intricacies of the legal system. But, yeah. So that’s more or less how trials work. They take as long as they need to. Usually they don’t draw a ton of outside attention, but sometimes you get big, scandalous cases, such as an Inspector being accused of corruption, and that’s gonna draw a lot of interest from the press and the general public. So, this is likely to be a bit more of a production than a lot of trials normally are. It might go for a few days.
Minna: Do we know when it’s set to happen?
Rhi: A few days from now. He was arrested on these charges pretty recently.
Minna: So they’re rushing to court.
Rhi: I feel like that’s actually pretty typical in Duskwall. They tend not to linger over people. It’s like, you get arrested, you sit for a couple days, maybe, and then they wanna just process you through the system as fast as possible.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, yeah, you all have not an eternity to prepare, but a few days.
Josie: Well, I see a few ways of going about this. One, we can try and stop it before it occurs by perhaps messing with documents or evidence or the like. Replacing Miss Drake with someone who is assuredly not gonna find a guilty verdict. Or, at least one of us replaces one of the sides in the case and rigs it.
Minna: If we wanna help out the defence, maybe we should find out what the prosecution has.
Rhi: Yes. Yeah.
Minna: Because I’m gonna assume they’re not super open about their evidence.
Rhi: No, no, no.
Josie: No. But we simply make sure that they have none for the case, when it comes up.
Minna: Do you think we can approach the defence openly? As like, we wanna help?
Rhi: You don’t know if he has, like, a lawyer. He may just be in a situation where he’s defending himself.
Minna: Oh. Can we visit him?
Rhi: That’s a good question. I think that he’s still held in Ironhook. I think Ironhook is just where he would be held, I don’t think that they do visitations. Unless you pay a bribe. Visitation hours are not standard, but anything in this city can be bought for the right money.
Josie: Right.
Minna: Can we bribe for a visit to find out?
Rhi: Yeah, to talk to him? Probably.
Minna: Do we have the money is more of my question.
Rhi: You do. I mean, you all are quite well off financially. You have a lot in your vault. You have eleven coin in your vault.
Minna: How much coin do you think would be the bribe?
Rhi: Four coin.
Minna: Four coin, Jesus.
Rhi: Normally it’s not that high, but he is–
Minna: He’s high profile.
Rhi: Yeah, he’s a very high profile target. And I think the price is set that high because there’s a number of reporters who are wanting to get in to talk to him and the guards don’t want to put up with that bullshit, so…
Josie: Right.
Rhi: He’s a big deal. He’s famous. Sucks for him.
Josie: Yes, I think phase one is getting the details from the horse’s mouth.
Minna: We’re going back to Ironhook.
Rhi: Yeah!
Josie (as Minx): Thank you Lani, thank you Roxanne.
Rhi: Yeah, as they’re walking to the door, Lani signs:
Rhi (as Lani): Good luck and be careful.
Josie: Oh, can I leave them a bundle of cookies from gangster grandma?
Rhi: Oh, yeah, [laughs] sure.
Josie: So I’ll leave them with something.
Rhi: Yeah. They both thank you for the cookies.
Josie: Alright. To Ironhook, again.
Rhi: Are all three of you heading to Ironhook together?
Josie: Actually, I feel a bit uncomfortable continuing to talk to someone of his nature, so I might try to figure out more about the high society persons involved.
Minna: I’d like to hear about the evidence at Ironhook, if possible, before I go to Jeren.
Rhi: Yeah, you can do multiple– people can do more than one Gather Info, so like, Myra and Blaire could go to Ironhook, and Minx will…
Minna: Yeah, I think that’s what I’m gonna do.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. Myra and Blaire are heading back to Ironhook.
Kim: Fun.
Rhi: Won’t this be fun. Yeah. So, the two of you approach the looming, hulking, structure that is Ironhook. Somehow, it’s more menacing approaching it the intended way than sneaking in through the sewers.
Kim: I believe that.
Rhi: And you get to, kind of, the outer walls and the gate and the guard there is like:
Rhi (as Guard): State your business.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Rhi (as Guard): What?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Minna: [laughs] Do you want Myra to step forward?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi (as Guard): I didn’t ask you a yes or no question.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): It’s alright. My young friend here is just a little bit nervous. We had some business with one of the people in your custody. We were wondering if you might be able to help us out with seeing them.
Rhi (as Guard): You know, that would depend on who it is and how invested you are in paying a visit.
Minna (as Myra): We are trying to get a visit with Inspector Severin.
Rhi (as Guard): Oh. Well. You better be very invested then.
Minna (as Myra): How invested?
Rhi: He names a price that’s the equivalent of four coin.
Minna (as Myra): Alright.
Minna: Are we spending this out of the crew vault, guys?
Rhi: Unless one of you has that on your person.
Minna (as Myra): I can contribute a coin towards it, if you guys don’t wanna only spend out of the vault.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, and I can contribute one coin, so that way we’re only pulling two from the vault.
Rhi: Okay. So, you’re gonna hand over the coin?
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: He takes the pouch of money and kinda, you know, opens it up, rifles through the coins and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): I like people who come prepared.
Rhi: And tucks the thing away into his coat and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Alright, come on.
Rhi: And the gates grind open, squeaking of metal that’s not fitted together just right. He leads you up the path towards the prison. So, he walks you into the prison, down a couple halls, and then leads you into basically just an interrogation room.
Minna (as Myra): Very uncomfortable place to be.
Rhi: Yeah. Table in the middle of the room, there’s two chairs on one side, one chair on the other. There’s a panel of one-way glass behind you, where presumably someone will be observing this interaction. So, good luck with that. He sits the two of you down and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): We’ll have somebody bring him around. Just wait here.
Rhi: And then he heads off, closes the door behind him.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispers] Myra.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re gonna be watched.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, that’s entirely possible.
Kim (as Blaire): No, no that’s probably what’s gonna happen. That’s a one-way mirror.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I understand.
Kim (as Blaire): What do we do?
Minna (as Myra): Well, we don’t have to talk about, you know, our connection to him. We can just pretend to be do-gooders trying to look into the evidence. We’re reporters.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Minna (as Myra): We’re Lani and Roxanne-style reporters, who care about the truth.
Kim (as Blaire): What’s your reporter name?
Minna and Rhi: [giggle]
Minna: Ugh, let me look up real quick. I know I have aliases ready, so.
Kim (as Blaire): I feel like Jane. Jane is a reporter name. But what’s a last name that goes with Jane? Jane Jameson!
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Oh. Oh I realise what I just did.
Josie: All she cares about is pictures. Pictures of Spider-Man!
[laughter]
Kim: Yep, I walked right into that one.
Rhi: Yeah, no, we have to do it now. That’s it.
Minna: Oh, I found it. Let’s go with Elinor Croaker. I don’t think I’ve done that one as an alias yet.
Rhi: I don’t think you have.
Minna: I’m just, every time Myra needs a name, I use one of the names I considered for Myra.
[laughter]
Kim: Nice.
Rhi: Alternate universe Myras. Alright, so after a kind of uncomfortably long time, like, you’re sitting there for ten minutes and it’s getting to the point where, you’re criminals, you’re paranoid, you’re sitting in a prison, you’re starting to think, ‘Ah shit, they figured it out, we’re gonna get arrested’. The door opens and a couple Bluecoats lead Severin in. He looks worse for wear. Doesn’t look like he went quietly. He’s got bruises on his face and on his arms. It doesn’t look like they really let him clean up, so there’s still blood crusted in his hair and in his moustache. He’s just in the ill-fitting prison uniform. He’s got shackles on his wrists and his ankles and they, you know, sit him down, basically chain him to the chair and the table and then one of the Bluecoats says:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): We’ll be right outside, holler if you need us.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Rhi: And they leave you in there. Severin, for his part, his eyes go a little wide when he sees you, but by the time he’s sitting down across from you he’s managed to, kind of keep his face blank.
Minna: Yeah. Myra’s gonna lean forward.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure you remember us. We’re the journalists who were asking you for some details about that case a few months back?
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): Yeah, yeah I…
Minna (as Myra): Elinor Croaker and Jane Jameson.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi.
Minna: She gestures to each of them so he knows which names to use.
Rhi: Yeah! [laughs]
Josie and Minna: [laugh]
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): Yes, yes of course.
Josie: I gave you pictures of Spider-Man.
[laughter]
Rhi: Dammit! Alright, so that’s gonna be the bit for this episode.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: He’s like:
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): Yes, yes I remember speaking with both of you. It’s good to see you again, I suppose, although not exactly ideal circumstances.
Rhi: He kind of rattles the chains a little bit.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, we were sorry to hear about your arrest. We actually were trying to look into your case this time. Make sure justice was being prosecuted accurately.
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): Well, I wish you the best of luck, but I don’t have a lot of confidence in this playing out fairly.
Minna (as Myra): Do you have representation in this case?
Rhi: He just laughs, he’s like:
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): Tch, no.
Minna (as Myra): Is it something that you’re not able to afford, or have you not been able to make a connection?
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): Both.
Minna (as Myra): Mm. [sighs] Okay. Do you know what kind of evidence they have against you? Or is there anything you have to argue against their case?
Rhi: This would be the point where I need a roll.
Minna: Alright.
Kim: Probably Consort.
Minna: Consort.
Rhi: Yeah, for sure.
Minna: We’re doing some classic Myra shit.
Rhi: Yep.
Minna: Holy shit! Okay, it’s a 5.
Rhi: 5, okay. He knows that they have sworn statements from a handful of nobles and merchants who are alleging that he took bribes from them. Of course, the people who offered bribes to the cop are not being charged with anything.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Because they’re too high-ranked for that.
Minna: No, just the cop who can’t afford or get representation.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s a great city, Duskwall. So, yeah, there’s people who either have confessed to giving him bribes, or people who are accusing him of shaking them down for money in exchange for leaving them alone.
Minna: If he took so much money from so many people, why can’t he afford a lawyer?
Rhi: Listen.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Duskwall is evil.
Rhi: I’m just– yeah. He says:
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): Some of these are people that I did deal with on cases, but none of them were really targets of investigations, just people that interacted with me tangentially. Personally I suspect that they were bribed into making those statements, but I can’t prove it from here. And as for the drugs and guns that I’m apparently dealing on the side–
Rhi: And he rolls his eyes.
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): – they found that after my arrest. It would have been very easy for someone to plant that in my apartment, or not even plant it at all, just claim that they’d found it there.
Rhi: And he kinda glances at the window behind and is like:
Rhi (as Inspector Severin): I am sure that our fine boys in blue would never do something like that!
Josie and Minna: [laugh]
Rhi: I think the two of you can hear, kind of like, muffled laughter from behind the glass.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Out of curiosity, just out of character, do we know about Inspector Severin? He has, like, a good reputation, right? As I recall.
Rhi: Yeah, when you talked to Jeren about him previously, Jeren had a very high opinion of him. He is, like, that’s another reason why this is such a big deal. Among a group of people who are known for being un-corruptible, he was a paladin type. He really stood out. And, like, he legitimately did go after some big targets and take down some actually genuinely corrupt, harmful people. Just, kind of like, the one legitimate black mark on his record was the Brogan thing. Which nobody knew about.
Minna: Okay, that was just a thing that I was curious about.
Rhi: Prior to this, his reputation was impeccable. Which means a lot of people fucking hated him. [laughs]
Minna: Yeah. Okay, let me think, really quick.
Rhi: Yeah. So, what he has. He can tell you about the evidence that they have. He does not have a lot to offer.
Minna: You can’t prove, like, an absence.
Rhi: Right.
Minna: All we can do is try and, like, discredit some of their evidence.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. More or less. Prove that those bribes happened, prove that those weapons and things–
Josie: Prove that Spider-Man is a menace.
Kim: [sighs]
Rhi: Mm-hmm, exactly. So, you can ask some other follow-up questions of the Inspector. But, you know, bearing in mind that you are being observed.
Minna: Yeah. Do you have any questions, Kim, that you can think of?
Kim: I can’t really think of anything, I’m sorry.
Minna: That’s cool. Gimme a second to think. I don’t wanna waste this.
Kim: [gasps]
Minna: Mm?
Kim: You can’t prove an absence unless there were witnesses.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: What if a ghost was a witness?
Rhi: That’s definitely something you could look into.
Kim: Ooh. [sings] Ghost justice!
Rhi: I’m not exactly sure what Duskwall’s laws say about ghost testimony, but I’m gonna guess it’s probably not super positive. But I think it’s definitely worth looking into.
Josie: One thing is that given that we know what he is… Minx would never suggest this, but Josie’s suggesting a plan to, I don’t know, maybe he can hop to a different person.
Rhi: He might. Like, that might be a plan that the possessor ghost has in mind. But, Blaire and Myra will be escorted back out of Ironhook, and as they are wrapping up that visit, we will cut over to Minx. Who is as usual, wining, dining, and charming the upper echelons of society.
Josie: It’s been a while since I’ve done some good, old-fashioned gossip.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m sure your presence has been sorely missed. So, what kind of information are you looking for?
Josie: Yeah, I’m looking for, like, gossip or what kind of people they are, generally.
Rhi: Okay, just learn more about Lord Mora and Lady Drake.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Some more details about them. Okay, yeah. Go ahead and make a roll.
Josie: I think I’m gonna do a Consort about it.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: And I got a 5.
Rhi: You already know a little bit about Lady Drake. You’ve kind of crossed paths with her previously. She has a reputation for being very intelligent, very clever, very ruthless, not great at parties. People don’t like it when she’s invited because she is, kind of like, really serious, stick-in-the-mud, not a super fun social person.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: She is known to be fairly heavily involved in The Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh. I’m trying to think… are there any, sort of, specific details you’re looking for about her?
Josie: No, that’s actually good stuff. I wanted to know more about these people personally, so I can maybe play on something.
Rhi: Lord Mora, you have a little harder time getting information about. He’s a person that everybody seems to know of, but very few people have actually ever met.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Most of what you hear is kind of second-hand. He has a reputation of being a fairly aggressive businessman. Most of the nobles kind of keep their focus on their Leviathan hunter fleets. That’s where most of their money comes from. His ships are usually pretty profitable, but he has, like, diversified his business a lot. He has some factories, there was that attempt at opening up a weapons factory earlier, that he’s still, apparently, kind of shopping around trying to find a place to set up with that. Personality wise, again this is kind of all second-hand, what you get is that he is the kind of person that actually he’s fun to have at a party so long as nobody makes him mad. He is very, like, friendly and cheerful and kind of boisterous at parties, but very short-tempered and liable to make a scene if he feels he has been slighted or wronged in any way. So, the general feeling is that people constantly have to be on eggshells around him.
Josie: Right. Interesting, interesting. Okay. And Lady Drake, do I also kinda get the sense that she, you know, does her job honourably?
Rhi: Oh hell no.
Josie: Hell no. Okay.
Rhi: No, no. She is corrupt as they come. That’s not something you get from this gossip, that is stuff that you have picked up from other things you’ve learned about her. No, she is crooked as hell.
Josie: Okay, alright. A plan is starting to brew, but I think we should cut away to Myra’s scene.
Rhi: Yeah. So, do you think this is the same day? Do you kinda send Blaire home and then you veer off?
Minna: Sure.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Because I don’t think we have time to dally.
Rhi: Yeah. Alright, so Myra, you break off to meet up with Jeren. Are you gonna just, like, send him a note and ask if he can meet you somewhere? Because you, again, can’t really go to his workplace. Three wanted levels.
Minna: Yeah, I wonder if maybe I ask him to meet me at the library, just because this is a legal thing, so we might be doing some research, if it comes to it.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. You had sent this message to Jeren, asking to meet as soon as possible. So, he shows up not as quickly as you would like, but it’s obvious when he gets there that he got here as quick as he could. He looks kind of flustered. His coat is a little mis-buttoned, like he missed one of them, so it’s off by one.
Minna: Aww.
Rhi: I assume that you probably grabbed, just like, a little private study room area, so you could talk.
Minna: I think I grabbed our private study room.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Oh God, that makes this even worse. So, he hustles in and shuts the door behind him and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): I got your note. Is everything okay, are you alright?
Minna (as Myra): I’m okay. I’m just working on something that I could use your help with.
Rhi (as Jeren): Oh.
Minna (as Myra): It’s not The Bluecoats this time.
Rhi (as Jeren): Uh huh…
Minna (as Myra): Also, hello. Sorry not to greet you. Um. Are you busy? Are you too busy for this?
Rhi (as Jeren): I mean, I don’t know what it is, so…
Minna (as Myra): Okay. There is about to be a serious mis-prosecution of justice. Lady Drake is about to try, in a few days, an Inspector who has been wrongfully accused.
Rhi (as Jeren): Wait, Severin?
Minna (as Myra): Yup.
Rhi (as Jeren): [sighs]
Minna (as Myra): Who, as you will remember, we have had dealings with in the past.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, yeah, I… wrongfully accused? Really? That– I mean, I thought you were… I thought this was the kind of thing, like, yes it’s disappointing. I thought this was the kinda thing you wanted, to get rid of corruption.
Minna (as Myra): He’s not corrupt. They are. The people forcing this trial are. They’re doing it to get him out of their hair, and he is partly on their trail because of us.
Rhi (as Jeren): [sighs]
Minna (as Myra): So, I would like to help him. Because he has helped us and I feel responsible.
Rhi: Hmm. Yeah, I think you’re gonna need to give me a roll.
Minna: Okay, I think it’s Consort?
Rhi: Oh, yeah.
Minna: This is a Gather Info, right?
Rhi: Yeah. This is seeing what he’s willing to do and what he’s willing to believe.
Minna: 5.
Rhi: 5, okay. So, he kinda like, rubs the back of his neck and sits down, is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): I guess…
Minna (as Myra): You believed in him, didn’t you? I remember you telling me.
Rhi (as Jeren): That does seem to make more sense, that he was being framed, than that he would have done all those things. I just, I don’t know, I was trying to be more realistic about things. I don’t know.
Minna (as Myra): You can be cynical, but you can also believe in people sometimes. I’m glad that you’re thinking about it, though.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, I… what do you want from me right now?
Minna (as Myra): We’re trying to interfere however we can in this. We know some of the evidence they probably have, which is probably evidence they’ve manufactured. But I don’t know how to counter it, exactly. We don’t have time to discredit all of it.
Rhi: Yeah, so he kinda nods and is thinking, and he’s like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Well, okay. So sworn statements that he thinks are bribes. If you can prove that one of them was, even just one, was bribed, than that’s gonna cast a lot of doubt on the rest. Especially if it was all the same person collecting the statements, which it probably was. I don’t know if I’ll have time to get you copies, but I can get you a list of the people who gave the statements.
Minna (as Myra): A list would be helpful. I don’t think we even need the copies, necessarily.
Rhi (as Jeren): Okay. I can get that.
Minna (as Myra): We want to get at the people.
Rhi (as Jeren): And any other information I can find out, who took the statements, I guess.
Minna (as Myra): How much effect is throwing doubt on the evidence gonna have on the decision of a case? Because this woman’s pretty determined.
Rhi (as Jeren): Well, you might need…
Minna (as Myra): If we get more of an audience? If we talked to–
Rhi (as Jeren): More of an audience. If you could get some witnesses that would discredit–
Minna (as Myra): Witnesses that would testify in favour of–
Rhi (as Jeren): Of Severin, yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Okay.
Rhi (as Jeren): Or people who could, with the weapons and stuff being planted, if you could get somebody to testify that they saw it being planted.
Minna (as Myra): That’s gonna be tough. It really is hard to prove honesty, unfortunately.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yep. [sighs]
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Rhi (as Jeren): That’s why I have the desk job that I have. I don’t have to prove much of anything. I just gotta fill out the paperwork.
Minna (as Myra): Fill out the paperwork, make sure you’ve got everything in its place.
Rhi (as Jeren): Pretty much.
Minna (as Myra): I put more hard choices on you than you signed up for, don’t I?
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. You really do.
Minna (as Myra): I didn’t think it was gonna be like this, when I struck out on my own.
Rhi (as Jeren): Neither did I. When you struck out on your own.
Minna (as Myra): Did you think I was gonna go straight?
Rhi (as Jeren): Well, kinda hoping.
Josie: Never straight, only forwards.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: That is very good.
Rhi (as Jeren): I was hoping, you know.
Minna (as Myra): If I could stand to watch all of this, at this point… but I can’t.
Rhi: He just kinda shakes his head and runs a hand through his hair, is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Well, I should probably get back and start pulling that information that you need.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. I hope you’re right, that he is innocent.
Minna (as Myra): Of what they’re accusing him of, yeah, I believe he’s innocent.
Rhi: [laughs] Best phrasing.
Minna: Well he knows about the ghost thing!
Rhi: Does he?
Minna: Doesn’t he?
Rhi: No.
Minna: No? He didn’t? Okay.
Rhi: No, Jeren doesn’t know.
Minna: What did I tell him about Severin? Because I said there was something sketchy.
Rhi: Yeah, but you didn’t tell him about the ghost.
Minna: Okay, okay.
Rhi: No, Jeren, you wouldn’t tell him that. He’s innocent.
Minna: Oh, I think I told him about bribery, maybe.
Rhi: Yeah I think you told him about the bribery and the blackmail, but you didn’t tell him about the, like, what he was being blackmailed over.
Minna: Yeah, the blackmail. Okay, yeah, because I didn’t know yet, when I was talking to him.
Rhi: Yeah, Jeren would not take that great.
Minna: Yeah, no. He would not.
Rhi: Yeah, I think when you say, ‘He’s innocent of what they’re accusing him of,’ he kinda like, quirks an eyebrow at you, but doesn’t ask any questions. Is just kinda like:
Rhi (as Jeren): I’ll just… we’ll come back to that.
Minna: I think Myra’s just gonna say to Jeren:
Minna (as Myra): Maybe you’ll be right about someone for once.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, for once.
Rhi: He shakes his head and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Alright, well, I’ll drop off whatever I find at the usual place. Be careful.
Minna (as Myra): You too.
Rhi: Exit Jeren, stage left.
Minna: Pursued by his doubts.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie and Kim: [laugh]
Rhi: Okay. Kim, did you still wanna do the ghost thing, of seeing if there were any spiritual witnesses to any of these things?
Minna: Yeah, we could use a witness.
Kim: I do!
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Alright! Yeah, so how do you wanna approach this?
Kim: I imagine I would have to go to the place where this happened.
Rhi: So, you know where he lives.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And, you know, that they were saying he had this stuff stashed in his apartment. So you could go to, like, around his apartment to see if you could find any spirits who could give you any intel.
Kim: Yeah, I think I will do that.
Rhi: Alright.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 6.
Rhi: Nice. Okay, so you’re hanging out around Severin’s building, trying not to look suspicious.
Kim: [singing] Don’t be suspicious, don’t be suspicious!
Rhi: And you find an alley that’s empty at the moment and duck in there. Because, like, looking into the ghost field is not something you can usually do subtly. Your eyes are glowing.
Kim: And also I put on a mask.
Rhi: Yeah. So, you duck into this alley, you put on your mask, you look into the ghost field and, you know, there’s just sort of the normal ghostly patterns and things of the city. Ghost doors and the echoes of old buildings, the faint shapes of living people moving down in the street, or up in the building that you’re looking at. Severin’s apartment, just by virtue of having a ghost being there for so long, is glowing a little brighter. Just, the stuff in there stands out a little more because of leftover ghost energy. But nothing about his apartment super stands out, so you look down and are looking straight at a ghost, who is standing right in front of you.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Hello.
Rhi (as Ghost): Uh, hello?
Rhi: She is still quite solid and held together, has a fairly well-defined form. She looks like she is not too much older than you.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: [sympathetic whine]
Rhi: Clothes are… let’s see. What was she… who were you?
Kim: Oh, what if it’s the Charter Hall uniform?
Rhi: Ooh, yeah. Yeah, I like that. I think she’s wearing something affiliated with Charter Hall. I think it’s the Hall of Alchemy.
Kim and Mina: [sympathetic groans]
Rhi: And you can of like, it’s sort of the sixth sense thing, where you kinda get a sense of how she probably died, because there’s burns all over the front of her uniform and her arms and her chest.
Kim: Oh, no!
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: She broke something and it blew up in her face.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m so sorry.
Rhi (as Ghost): Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I measured some stuff wrong.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m lucky I only ever singed my hair. I’m from an alchemist family and I went to Charter Hall for a little bit.
Rhi (as Ghost): Oh!
Kim (as Blaire): The same, in alchemy. So, I’m sorry.
Rhi (as Ghost): Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, eh. I’ve kinda made my peace with it.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah?
Rhi (as Ghost): I guess I didn’t have any unfinished business hanging over me, that’s what people say, right?
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs] Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Rhi (as Ghost): Yeah. But, um, yeah! So, what are you doing? What are you looking for? Are you looking for what’s his face? Who used to live up there?
Kim (as Blaire): No, I know where Severin is.
Rhi (as Ghost): He was cool.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, he was. Did you happen to be here when The Bluecoats came and inspected? Did they happen to plant any evidence here? Like, any guns or drugs?
Rhi (as Ghost): Oh, yeah, yeah! He used to chat with me sometimes, because like…
Rhi: She kinda looks around and is like:
Rhi (as Ghost): [loud whisper] He was a ghost! I guess you probably know that, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I knew that. [laughs]
Rhi (as Ghost): Yeah, okay. I just, you know, I just don’t want people to catch wind of it. Although, I’m a ghost too, they can’t really hear me, can they? [shouts] He was a ghost!
[laughter]
Rhi (as Ghost): Anyway, yeah, he used to chat with me sometimes.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi (as Ghost): And yeah, I was hanging around and it wasn’t Bluecoats that planted it. I guess that’s what they were doing? There were some people who came by that had all this stuff. Guns and drugs and stuff. And they, like, hid it around his apartment. Didn’t hide it real well.
Kim (as Blaire): But they weren’t Bluecoats?
Rhi (as Ghost): No, but they brought the stuff in and planted it and then they left. And then, like, ten minutes later the Bluecoats came in and they knew exactly where everything was.
Kim (as Blaire): Ah. Did you get any good look at the group? Who it was?
Rhi (as Ghost): Yeah! Yeah.
Rhi: She didn’t get any names, but she can give you descriptions of the people.
Kim: Do I recognise the gang?
Rhi: Yeah. As she’s describing them, she mentions black coats with brass detailing, brass buttons and things, which–
Minna: That’s Umbra, right?
Rhi: Yeah, that’s the uniform of The Umbra Hunters. You recognise it right off.
Kim (as Blaire): So The Umbra Hunters are behind this. Interesting. Well, I don’t want to ask too much of you, and this is a little unorthodox, but would you be willing to testify in court that the evidence was planted, in defence of Severin?
Rhi (as Ghost): Wow. Is that legal?
Minna: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): I will make it legal.
Rhi (as Ghost): I don’t think that’s legal. I don’t know that you can, I mean I like what you’re thinking… uh… I just, if you can find a way for me to do it, that doesn’t involve me getting, like, shoved into a jar or disintegrated or something, because like–
Kim (as Blaire): I will do absolutely everything I can to protect you. Although I may have to jar you up, I’m sorry, to bring you home.
Rhi (as Ghost): Wait, what?
Kim (as Blaire): [hesitates] Actually, you know what? You seem cool.
Rhi (as Ghost): Thanks.
Kim (as Blaire): Like, this should be fine. You can just hang out. You can hang out in my room.
Minna: [laughing] Oh my God.
Rhi: Actually, I don’t know if she can, because you have the place warded against ghosts pretty good right now. You would have to bring her through in a jar.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, well, you can hang out outside my house.
Rhi (as Ghost): Um.
Kim (as Blaire): Or you can stay here, I can find you again, it doesn’t really matter.
Rhi (as Ghost): Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m gonna find a way to make it legal.
Rhi (as Ghost): [doubtfully] Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Because you still have you mind and by that right you should still have rights.
Rhi (as Ghost): I like your moxie. What’s your name, by the way? We didn’t really do that part. I forget sometimes.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, yeah, sorry! No, that’s okay. My name’s Blaire. What’s your name?
Rhi (as Ghost): Oh, I’m Tira.
Kim (as Blaire): Tira?
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah, Tira… uh… hmm. Nope, don’t seem to have a family name up here anymore. Well that’s annoying.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s okay.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah, I forget stuff sometimes.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s okay, I’ve heard that’s pretty common, actually.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh, alright.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m sorry. I just, you know. As long as you don’t forget who you are, you should be okay.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. Well, right now I know that I am Tira and I was an alchemy student and I fucked up pretty bad.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs] Well…
Rhi (as Tira): I’m gonna go haunt the lab.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay!
Rhi (as Tira): I threatened to do that with my lab partners and I feel like I should make good on it.
Josie and Minna: [laugh]
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, well you have fun with that. Oh, but by the way, when this is all said and done and you’ve testified and, you know, I don’t need you for any favours anymore, I have some friends that can help you out. Friends like you.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh! Like, see-through, ghost, dead friends?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, yes, but they’re special. They remember who they are.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh.
Kim (as Blaire): You’ll be in good company.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay. Can I meet them even if I’m not able to testify?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I’ll bring you to them.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay. I’m gonna go haunt the lab now!
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Have fun!
Rhi (as Tira): She runs off.
Josie: Aww.
Kim (as Blaire): Tell Professor Pennyworth I said hi!
Rhi (as Tira): [shouts] I’m gonna throw an eraser at his head!
Kim (as Blaire): Nice!
Rhi: [laughs] I like this ghost.
Kim: I love her a lot.
Josie: She’s so good.
Kim: I love her.
Rhi: She’s very weird.
Minna: She seems like a good buddy for Blaire, honestly. Like, they seem like they would have been fun classmates.
Rhi: Yeah, I think they just missed each other.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, definitely.
Rhi: Alright. What do you all wanna do?
Minna: I feel like we should be the fucking legal defence team.
Josie: [laughs] Yeah, definitely.
Minna: I honestly feel like that’s the way that’s gonna go best, unless we can find a face for us. Because we’re also super wanted, so maybe we shouldn’t appear in a court of law.
Josie: We have the resources for disguises.
Minna: Yeah. I think we just need to make it as much of, like, a public spectacle as possible, while discrediting the evidence against him.
Josie: Right. I mean, part of me is just tempted to ghost bomb the whole thing.
Rhi: Yeah. I will say though, in terms of disrupting the trial, having a ghost show up is a great strategy. In terms of having that ghost make it out of the situation okay, maybe not the best.
Kim: I will fight everyone.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: We know, dear.
Minna: What if you have her possess you and speak through you?
Kim: [gasps] Yo!
Minna: That way your body, like, protects her.
Kim: That is a great idea. I’m free real estate.
Minna: [laughs] Don’t call yourself ‘free real estate’, Blaire!
Josie: [laughs] Real estate?
Kim: I’m free real estate.
Josie: That’s not how it works.
Rhi: I don’t know if I’ve ever been so unhappy that we play this online, because I really wish you all could see the look on my face right now. I’m not exactly… I feel like it’s the Venn diagram, the overlapping part of, like, horror and being impressed and…
Kim: I love this idea, we’re gonna do it.
Rhi: What’s the feeling, like, the feeling of watching a really bad but fictional car crash in slow motion. That’s how I feel right now. Like, watching a real car crash is just bad, but a fictional one, it’s kind of like, ‘Oh that looks horrible, but also I’m enjoying this’.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: That’s my emotional state.
Minna: [giggles]
Kim: We’re definitely doing this, thank you Minna.
Minna: So we have two lawyers and a witness, is that what we’re saying?
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Right. Okay, so we are aiming to win this and not… well, we are cheating it, but not trying to get it thrown out on a technicality.
Minna: I mean, they cheated first. We’re just showing that they cheated.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Right. I’m saying, we’re trying to get an innocent verdict, not get it thrown out or delayed.
Kim: Right.
Minna: So… what kind of fucking score is a courtroom drama?

Minna: [laughs]
Kim: Thank you. Didn’t we take care of Inspector ghost-man?"
"Season 2, Episode 18: The Defense Attorneys Score, Part 2 Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly.
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall and thank you so much for listening. We are fast approaching the end of Season Two, believe it or not. I just finished editing the final episode of Season Two, which will be released in early September, I believe, and we’re really excited to dive into recording for Season Three soon. In the meantime, please continue to support the show in all the ways you can. Right now, we’d really love to get some new reviews on iTunes. We haven’t gotten too many in the last couple months, and reviews and ratings are a great way for the show to become more visible to new listeners. So if you listen on iTunes or Apple Podcasts, consider leaving us a review, so that new listeners will know what you love about the show.
Gen Con is approaching very quickly, and if you’re going, Minna and I will be there again this year. I will have Magpies bookmarks and I’ll be moderating a panel, ‘So You Want to Start an AP Podcast?’ Tickets are still available for that panel, and we’d love to see some fans there. Next, Minna is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Minna: RAICES is a non-profit agency that promotes justice by providing free and low-cost legal services to under-served immigrant children, families and refugees. They provide consultations, direct legal services, representation, assistance and advocacy to communities in Texas and to clients after they leave the state. In 2017, RAICES staff closed 51,000 cases at no cost to the client. If you’d like to donate to support their work, go to www.RaicesTexas.org/donate.
Rhi: In addition, for our US listeners, please continue to call your representatives and demand that the house begin an impeachment inquiry. Show up to protests against the concentration camps at our borders, or reach out to organisations backing those protests for other ways to help if you can’t attend in person. Raise your voice in whatever way you can.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## Story continues [00.02.19]
Minna: So… what kind of fucking score is a courtroom drama?
Rhi: Yeah, let’s talk. Probably Social or Deception, let me…
Josie: Fun thing, I have ‘Like Looking in a Mirror’, so that’ll be useful in a courtroom.
Minna: So you’ll know when to press your line of questioning.
Rhi: Yeah, no one can lie to you.
Minna: I feel like Minx has to be, like, the main lawyer, because you’re really good at Sway, too.
Josie: Of course, I’m the one with the aesthetic for it.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Kim: What is your lawyer outfit, and does it include glasses?
Josie: Oh, yes. Absolutely.
Kim: Nice.
Rhi: So, this is probably… I dunno, I feel like this could be a Social or Deception plan.
Minna: I feel like if it’s Social, the connection is that we are Severin’s lawyers.
Josie and Kim: Yeah.
Josie: I honestly feel like this is more Social.
Minna: Yeah. We’re trying to prove the truth.
Rhi: Engagement roll. One for luck. Is this operation particularly bold or daring? Yeah.
Josie: Okay [laughs]
Rhi: You’re impersonating lawyers in a very high-profile case in front of somebody who has been in the group that you were at war with two weeks ago.
Kim: Also, I’m letting someone possess me.
Rhi: Also Blaire’s plan is to let someone possess her.
Minna: Have we, like, changed our hair colours or something? Like, how disguised are we?
Rhi: Yeah, we’ll get into that. Any of your friends or contacts… yeah, you’ve gotten a lot of intel about this. Other elements you wanna consider… you’re not lawyers. I’m removing a die because none of you are actually lawyers. Oh no.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: I rolled a 1 and a 2.
Kim: [screams]
Josie: [groans]
Minna: Rhi’s dice.
Kim: No!
Rhi: Okay. Alright. Let me think. So, the three of you spend the next couple days putting disguises together, you know, forging the documents that you need to present yourself as Severin’s legal counsel. Tell me about your disguises.
Josie: Minx is going for ‘elegant, distinguished librarian’ look.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: And that is gonna kinda be the attitude she’s going for.
Rhi: Right, so glasses, probably has dyed her hair.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, okay.
Minna: Just, in general, what is Minx’s disguise catalogue like? Does she have wigs? Or if we have different hair colours, does it have to be dye?
Josie: Um, both?
Minna: I feel like a blonde wig would actually work as a really effective disguise for Myra.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, might as well.
Minna: So, Myra has one of Minx’s wigs and, like, a tweed skirt suit. And possibly glasses, as well.
Josie: Minx is dying her hair black for the duration, since she has a couple days to do that.
Rhi: Alright. What is Blaire’s disguise as the witness here?
Kim: I am struggling with this, because I imagine it’s very hard to disguise a Tycherosi.
Minna: But to be fair, if you take off the make-up, that changes a lot.
Rhi: True.
Minna: Maybe you could paint the horns, to like, get a different horn colour?
Rhi: Yeah, do your hair up nice.
Kim: I’m trying to think. How do you disguise a Tycherosi that I’m not a Tycherosi?
Josie: Do you need to look like you’re not a Tycherosi? Can you just look like a different Tycherosi?
Kim: I guess not. I guess making the horns white and throwing the wig on is really all I can do.
Josie: Yeah, might as well.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay. The courtrooms in Duskwall are typically not very large. They don’t usually have much of an audience, so this place is packed to the point of being a little claustrophobic, almost. It’s really, really crowded in here. There are reporters, there are a bunch of other inspectors who have showed up to witness this, there are just people, you know, who are spending their day watching a very public scandal go down. And up at the front of the room, Lady Drake is seated. There’s Minx and Myra, looking very lawyerly. And at the table opposite them is the prosecutor, who is just a city prosecutor. She is making the case for the state. Her name is Thora Kinclaife. Thank you Minna.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And she has just finished, basically, the prosecution’s arguments. You know, presenting the case that the city has. Lady Drake has been listening, occasionally jotting down some notes, but mostly just watching and absorbing. And then her eyes slide over to the two of you, Minx and Myra, and she studies you for a long moment. She’s been glancing at you throughout, just to keep an eye on you, and this is typically the point in the trial where she would call upon the defence to begin their case. But she just studies the two of you for a moment and then says:
Rhi (as Lady Drake): We’re going to take a brief break. I need to speak with the defence counsel in my chambers.
Kim: [groans]
Rhi: And she jerks her head at the door behind her.
Josie: Minx, in an attempt to keep her cool, will look down and do this.
Rhi: Push up her glasses.
Minna: Dramatically push up her glasses.
Josie: She’s going to be doing that after basically everything. [laughs] Because it’s cool.
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, so the two of you follow her through the door at the back of the courtroom. This looks like it’s her office. It’s pretty austere, but it’s minimalist in that way that only rich people can pull off, where it’s like, there’s not a lot in here but the few things that are in here are just oozing money. There’s her desk and then her chair and then two lesser, not as comfortable chairs opposite. She gestures for you to sit, takes a seat at her desk, steeples her fingers and is like:
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Myra Keel and Elizabeth… well, I assume it’s a made-up name.
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi (as Lady Drake): No one in your position would have… Cordonnier, I think, is what you were going by.
Kim: Shit!
Rhi (as Lady Drake): At least, last time you were arrested. Terribly interested to know why I shouldn’t just have you arrested right now.
Josie (as Minx): Well, you presume that is something you would be able to succeed at.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): I could have you both thrown out and arrested, and I’m sure your other little friend is around here somewhere.
Minna (as Myra): Wouldn’t you like to play the game?
Rhi (as Lady Drake): See. I knew I was right about you. I would, is the thing. See, there was all that unpleasantness with Avrathi and Brogan and the constant trying to kill you business, all that unpleasantness. But, there’s been a bit of a division amongst me and my friends, lately. Some of us are still on the side that the best way to deal with you is to just get rid of you. But I think that is a waste of talent. I want to see how well you can do. I want to see if you can pull this off. Severin’s ruined either way. With his reputation being destroyed, he’s not going to be back in the ranks of the Inspectors.
Josie (as Minx): I know the answer to this, but I’ll give you the chance to talk. Why do you want to see what we are made of further?
Rhi (as Lady Drake): I’ve done research into all of you, and you are all remarkably unexceptional criminals. There’s nothing that stands out in your backgrounds. Petty theft, minor identity fraud, your other little friend dabbling with ghosts and getting herself kicked out of school. All rather un-extraordinary. And yet, you have been absolute thorns in our sides for so long. And I believe that you would be far more use in our service than, I don’t know, down at the bottom of a canal somewhere.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well I much enjoy these games as well. But, it seems a poor opening move to take us aside into a room alone with you.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): You’re not threatening me, are you? Because that would end very poorly for you.
Josie (as Minx): I’m merely questioning your gambit.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Well, I suppose the only way to find out if it was a mistake or not is to carry on and see how well your arguments go.
Rhi: And she’s gonna stand up and gesture for you two to head to the door.
Kim: Now or never.
Josie: I’m trance powder-ing her.
Rhi: Roll it. Desperate position.
Josie: Yep. I’m pushing myself.
Rhi: Okay. Don’t forget to mark XP for this desperate action as well.
Josie: Ooh, right. I imagine this takes Myra a bit off-guard, so I’m not expecting aid in this.
Minna: Yeah, no. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Shit, you crit-ed!
Rhi: Jesus.
Josie: Critical.
Kim: Oh, damn.
Rhi: Okay, so you throw the trance powder in her face and she wavers on her feet and then just, kind of like, drops heavily back into her chair. It’s that thing where you’re really tired and you just kinda collapse. It’s like that. And then is just kinda of like spacing out, but she’s not quite as spaced out as normal. She’s clearly pretty out of it, but she kind of is looking at you and smirking a little. It’s a little unsettling. But she doesn’t seem to be moving, otherwise.
Josie: Minx will stand up and lean over the table a bit, and say:
Minna (as Myra): See, the thing about this opening move is it tells me you have not actually done your research on us, or what you’re actually about. Otherwise, you would know this was a terrible opening move for you. Now Myra, what do you think our next move should be? I’m half-tempted to end this, but also to see how the trial plays out in her inebriated state.
Kim: [whispers] Kill, kill, kill.
Rhi: I will remind you that things happen immediately when you kill someone. There is no such thing as a quiet death in Duskwall.
Kim: Oh right, fuck.
Minna (as Myra): If we kill her now, we have to leave very quickly and also somehow get Severin out. Which, I don’t know if we can do that. There are Bluecoats everywhere and I very much think the Spirit Wardens won’t be far behind.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. Then it seems we might need to progress to the mid-game then. Your Honour, would you accompany us back to the courtroom?
Rhi: I mean, she can’t really respond. She’s pretty out of it.
Josie: Is she able to do anything? Or is she just zonked out?
Rhi: Hmm… I think she’s just pretty zonked out, because of the increased effect.
Kim: So, we may have fucked up.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, like if you try to get her to stand, she wobbles on her feet and then falls back in her chair.
Josie: What would happen if we just went back to the courtroom?
Rhi: And just waited?
Josie: Yeah, and just waited.
Rhi: I dunno. You could find out.
Minna: Okay, so then I think maybe Myra leans over Minx’s shoulder.
Minna (as Myra): Let’s play the game. But you have not got a head start. We do.
Rhi: So are you two gonna head back out?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: God, it’s a bad idea, guys.
Minna: We didn’t kill her. We could have.
Josie: She’s a well-known and a high-ranking patron of the Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh. I think it’s totally believable that she, like, took a hit of something once we were done talking.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Oh, true. Alright.
Rhi: We’ll see. So, the two of you return to the courtroom. There’s low murmuring in the crowd, people are scribbling things down, the reporters are taking notes, some people are wandering in and out of the room. And the fifteen minutes that Lady Drake had said the break would be comes and goes. And then another five minutes go by. Then another ten minutes go by. A couple of the Bluecoats are starting to eye each other and are muttering to one another about, like, ‘Should we go?’, and eventually one of them, after a half hour break, goes and knocks on the door. And then, after another few minutes, Lady Drake comes out, still looking a little glassy-eyed, but, you know, moving under her own power. And she takes a seat and doesn’t look that put out about the situation. Still kind of gives you a bit of a smirk and nod as she sits and says:
Rhi (as Lady Drake): The defence may present their case.
Josie: Alright, so, out of character, just making sure we have all the details. Because I am not a lawyer and have really bad memory things in my head.
Rhi: Yes, well let me also, the mechanics of this is that there is a 12-tick clock in order for them to win the case, and they have a limited number of rolls in which they can try to hit that number. The details you have available to you: You are pretty sure that the merchants and nobles who submitted witness statements against Severin were bribed. You have their names and you also have the name of the Bluecoat Lieutenant who collected all of the statements. It was one person who did all of that, which Jeren had pointed out is sketchy. That’s indicative of something else perhaps going on.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You know that The Umbra Hunters were the ones who planted the evidence in Severin’s apartment.
Minna: Yeah, because they have basically two major avenues of evidence. And we have stuff to, kind of, try and discredit both of those.
Rhi: Yes. So, take it away.
Minna: Do we wanna, like… is this where we call our own witnesses? That’s what this portion is?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie and Minna: Okay.
Minna: I just assume it kinda goes in phases of the trial, and this is our part where we–
Rhi: Yeah, you know, it’s just, like, just wing it. I’m basing this on what I’ve seen on Law & Order, it’s fine. I am not a lawyer.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Let’s do the portion where we call our own witnesses, then.
Rhi: To start with you are at risky, standard, and then things will adjust.
Minna: I will say I think our main thesis is all of the evidence that they have shown can be disproven.
Rhi: Yeah. It is lies.
Josie (as Minx): It is our stance that our client, Inspector Severin, stands accused based on false and at the very least improperly carried out procedures of justice. The evidence presented and, to wit, our first witness can attest to, is not sufficient and may have been planted by outside hands. And to this, I call forth our first witness.
Josie: And I will call whatever Blaire’s alias is.
Kim: Jane Jameson.
Rhi: Well, that was your reporter. That was your reporter name.
Kim: Yes.
Minna: What’s your witness name?
Rhi: Are you using the same one?
Kim: Sure.
[laughter]
Kim: No one will know, except Severin.
Josie (as Minx): I call to the stand Jane Jameson.
Rhi: We’re opening with Blaire being possessed. Alright, let’s rock and fucking roll, then! Blaire takes the stand.
Kim: I take an oath, probably.
Rhi: No, I don’t know what they would have you swear on. No, I take that back. It’s probably some kind of oath to the Immortal Emperor.
Minna: Yep.
Kim: Oh gross, yeah, that’s definitely it.
Rhi: That’s super it, yeah.
Minna: It’s like on the seal of the Immortal Emperor that they have in the courtroom.
Rhi: Yeah, swearing to the Immortal Emperor that you will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. So, there’s gonna be basically two rolls that you’re gonna have to do for this. One of them is gonna be to have this ghost possess you and have her not accidentally eat your soul. And then you’re gonna have to make a roll for your argument. I think basically that first roll is the setup roll. And you can have that as a flashback, like it could be that she possessed you a while ago, but you’ve gotta make a roll for it so we know what we’re dealing with here.
Kim: Right. Am I rolling some kinda resistance here?
Rhi: I think you’re doing an Attune roll.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: To see how well this goes for her, and you, as a combo.
Kim: I think I wanna push myself for luck.
Rhi: Probably a good idea.
Kim: Okay, my highest there was a 5.
Rhi: Okay. So you track Tira down again. She tells you about haunting the labs and throwing things at her old professors and you have a great time. And then you pitch this idea of, like, you’ll possess me and use me to be the witness, and she’s like:
Rhi (as Tira): That sounds like it could end badly for you, but okey dokey!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, she is sharing headspace with you.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: And is not trying to eat your soul.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Which is great. A+. However, it seems that among the things that she’s forgotten how to do is, like, steer a body.
[laughter]
Rhi: So, you trip three times on your way to the witness stand.
Kim: I should probably just play it off as, like, I am injured or ill or something?
Rhi: Well, so here’s the thing. The two of you are not, like, you’re not Jaeger-ing your body right now. One of you is more in control than the other, and right now since Tira is the one who has to talk, she is the one in control. So, you’re at reduced effect, because you look clumsy and out of it and you do not look like a super reliable witness right now.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: You could push yourself to get yourself back up to standard effect, but right now you’re at reduced effect.
Josie (as Minx): Now, Ms Jameson, would you kindly recount for the court what you witnessed but a few evenings ago.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Certainly.
Rhi: Make your roll first, so that we know how this is gonna be delivered. Because if this roll goes badly, [laughs] you’re not answering, I am. Depending on how badly Tira does.
Kim: Okay. So, that’s a Sway, for sure. Wanna push myself again for an extra dice.
Rhi: Good call. You two are welcome to aid her, as well.
Josie: Yeah, I’m immersing myself in the role.
Kim: So that’s an assist?
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Thank you. So, my highest was a 4.
Rhi: Okay. So, you do it at reduced effect, and there’s gonna be some kind of consequence. So, okay yeah. Go ahead with what you’re gonna say, and bear in mind that this is Tira and Blaire kind of negotiating how this is going, so it’s probably not gonna sound super coherent.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): [hesitantly] Certainly. So, uh… I think I was–, no, I am a student of Charter Hall and I was doing research–, no, no. I was walking between campuses and, um, when I was doing that I… yes. I passed by, um, Inspector Severin’s apartment, or–
Josie (as Minx): Just for the sake of clarity of the record, may you restate that so no errant phrases have been captured.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): …yes. [pause] I am a student of Charter Hall and I… was walking to the store, when I walked past an apartment that I think was Lord Sev–, no, Inspector Severin’s? And, um, I saw people going into that apartment and… um… they, uh… they did something bad. They, um… uh… they murdered–, no! No, they didn’t murder anyone. They… went, they planted some evidence in the house. Like, the evidence they planted was some coin, no, it wasn’t coin. It… um…
Rhi: [laughs] Severin, by the way, is sitting there with his head in his hands.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Sorry, what am I saying, again?
Kim: She’s gonna look at Minx.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): You’re simple recounting the events, do not worry about ascertaining whether it was evidence or not, merely–
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): What events? What events am I retaining?
Josie (as Minx): The events you saw a few evenings ago, while you were walking to the store. As you said.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): [gasps] Oh! Okay, yeah. Yeah. They put guns and drugs in his house. I think. Pretty sure.
Josie (as Minx): And you bore witness to these items being carried?
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): And they were clearly identifiable as such.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Bluecoats. Wait, no, no, the… Lamp… mm… the Umbro Hunters, I’m pretty sure. The Umbral Hunters. Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): I see, then that is a criminal organisation.
Rhi: Yeah, there’s a little bit of a murmur through the crowd when she says that.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Mm-hmm, yeah. They’re super crime people. They’re big into crime.
Josie (as Minx): I see. And you, for the clarity of the record, saw these Umbra Hunters carrying illicit goods into Severin’s apartment.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): And I would like the court to note that this is after our client was taken into custody.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Noted.
Rhi: And she’s just looking at Minx and, like, she just shakes her head a little bit. It’s a look of, ‘I’m disappointed’.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Am I free to go now?
Josie (as Minx): You are not being detained. Yes, you may step down from the stand.
Rhi: You trip down the stairs.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Ow. I forgot how to do this.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: Yeah, so you can wander off to wherever. Kim, that was fucking perfect. It was so good.
Josie and Kim: [laugh]
Kim: Thank you.
Rhi: Oh man.
Josie: Minx is gonna pinch the bridge of her nose.
Rhi: Yep.
[laughter]
Rhi: Alright, so you got 1 out of 12. I think that if Blaire is still, sort of, wandering around up there, eventually a Bluecoat will gently escort you to the back of the room where you can retake your seat.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Oh, where are we going?
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Back to your seat, ma’am. Just, here, have a seat, here you go. Sit down. Please try not to move, I don’t want you to hurt yourself.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Oh, we’re sitting now. Okay. I can sit. We can sit.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Sitting is very easy for us.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I think the Bluecoat looks at you for a second, then leans down and is like:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Look, can you tell me who your dealer is, because it sounds like you are on some really serious drugs.
[laughter and applause]
Rhi (as Bluecoat): And lemme tell ya, this job is rough and I feel like I could use whatever you’re on.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Oh, dude, yeah. I could totally hook you up. It’s in my house!
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Okay, where do you live?
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Um, I live in Coalridge.
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Okay, I’ll look you up down there sometime.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Yeah!
Josie: Okay, so I have my next witness.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I wanna call the person who took the testimonies to the stand.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, you can do that.
Josie: And basically my goal is to get him to admit that he took all the testimonies.
Minna: But I can follow up with, like, bribery.
Josie: Yes. And mostly I wanna establish that proper procedure wasn’t followed.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Because it’s unusual for one person to take all the testimonies.
Rhi: It’s gonna be risky, standard.(TC: 00:30:00)
Josie: I’m gonna make a Sway about it. I got a 5.
Rhi: Yeah, so you question this guy. He’s a little better on the stand than Blaire was. That’s a very low bar to clear. He is pretty smooth, but because you can tell every time he’s lying, you’re able to jump on that as soon as he starts lying, and that throws him off a bit. You do get him to admit that, like, yeah, he took all the statements and that, yeah, that’s unusual. But because you’re not as familiar with the intricacies of the legal code, you’re not able to necessarily pin him down on the specific regulations he’s violating. So there’s an implication of wrongdoing, but it’s not super clear cut.
Josie: Yeah. I think Myra should call the next witness.
Minna (as Myra): I would like to cross-examine one of the opposition’s witnesses.
Rhi: Yeah, so somebody who claimed that they had been–
Minna: Yes. Is this… I wanna say Jemmis Castle?
Rhi: Sure.
Minna: Alright.
Minna (as Myra): I call Jemmis Castle to the stand.
Rhi: Alright. This is one of the merchants who claimed that Severin was shaking them down for money.
Minna: Mm-hmm, yep.
Rhi: Yeah, so go ahead and do your roll.
Minna: What kind of roll is it?
Rhi: Probably a Sway. Could be Command, I could see an argument there. I don’t think that you can really get away with Consort here.
Minna: Yeah, I prefer Command, and I think that makes sense, because we have talked. Okay, flashback that we have talked about this. I don’t know how much it costs, but I think that she was able to, like, talk to this person ahead of time and be like:
Minna (as Myra): You are going to testify. You are going to tell the truth on the stand, because I know–
Minna: Blah, blah, etc. I don’t know if we need to do that as a flashback scene?
Rhi: Oh, so are you saying that Myra spoke to him previously?
Minna: Yes, I said I tracked down the people on the list and I found somebody who was willing to testify for us, in exchange for something. Like, to recant their statement.
Josie: That’s cool.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I don’t know in exchange for what. We can discuss that. [laughs]
Rhi: Um… more money than they were paid originally?
Josie: Well, how much we they paid?
Rhi: Let’s find out. They were paid three coin. So if you can beat that.
Minna: I have two coin on my person.
Rhi: And nine in the vault.
Minna: How do you guys feel about that?
Kim: I think we have to.
Josie: Yeah, I’m okay with that.
Rhi: Alright, yeah. So you previously paid this person to testify for you.
Minna: Did I pay stress for that flashback?
Rhi: I’m gonna say one stress, because you also paid a hell of a lot of cash.
Minna: I’m gonna take two more so I can push myself. That gives me… I start with two dice, add another die for the push myself, then I have greater effect. Does anybody wanna assist me, or is anybody able to assist me?
Josie: Yeah, you know what? I’ll assist you. We’re a legal team working together, that’s not hard to justify.
Rhi: So four dice.
Minna: 6!
Rhi: Nice. Okay, so at greater effect that is gonna get you 5 ticks on your clock. This is huge.
Minna: [excited gasp] This is huge, because it discredits so many others! Okay, so I think what it looks like is:
Minna (as Myra): Jemmis Castle, were you one of the witnesses who submitted a sworn statement?
Rhi (as Jemmis): I was, yes.
Minna (as Myra): And did you tell the whole truth in that statement?
Rhi: No. No, I didn’t.
Kim: [exaggerated gasp]
Rhi: Yeah, a gasp goes off through the crowd. And this person seems to be, kind of like, realising that now they’re the centre of attention of this whole thing and is like:
Rhi (as Jemmis): [dramatically] Yeah, that’s right. This Bluecoat Lieutenant came and said that he would offer me money if I signed this statement, and I barely remembered Inspector Severin, but I figured I could use the coin. But it’s just been weighing on my conscience since then and I have to tell the truth!
[laughter]
Rhi: And so, yeah, this person just explains–
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): You’re doing amazing, sweetie!
[laughter]
Rhi: So this person just explains how all of it was complete fabrication. All of it was made up. And that just shockwaves through the courtroom. Lady Drake has to call for order. It’s a huge bombshell. And bumps you up to 8 out of 12 on your clock.
Kim: Nice.
Minna: I think Myra just dismisses the witness and primly sits down in the midst of all this uproar.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Shoots a little smirk Drake’s way.
Rhi: She kinda does the nod of like, ‘Alright, yeah. You did a good one’. You’ve recovered. Here’s the thing; from Lady Drake’s perspective, no matter how this turns out, she’s considering it a win. Because either she gets to convict this guy, or she gets further evidence that you all are worth pursuing in a different way. So, how do you wanna wrap this up?
Josie: I have a train of thought here, but there’s a missing link. We know that former Umbra Hunters worked at The Centuralia Club, correct?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: What would I need to pull out of my ass right now to show that to the court?
Minna: Well, Brogan owned The Centuralia Club and Severin put him away. We could suggest that this is a frame-up job on his behalf.
Josie: That’s exactly what I’m going to suggest, but right at the beginning there, we need that plausible nugget for me to say persons associated with the Umbra Hunters were working at The Centuralia Club.
Rhi: I don’t think that’s too much of a stretch.
Minna: Especially if we say that Blaire, slash Tira, described their uniforms, and we could get another witness who has seen the uniforms of the guards at The Centuralia Club. Because don’t they use the same uniforms?
Rhi: Yeah. They’re not subtle.
Minna: I don’t think it would be very tough to find multiple witnesses who could describe the uniforms of the guards at The Centuralia Club.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, I think then you can say the former owner of The Centuralia Club was put away–
Minna: The former owner of The Centuralia Club was put away by Inspector Severin. Maybe the two of us, like, examine a series of witnesses and then do the closing argument.
Josie: Okay.
Minna: So, do we wanna do a group roll?
Kim: I guess.
Rhi: I think that would make sense.
Minna: Like a group Sway or something.
Josie: Yeah, let’s do a group Sway.
Minna: Okay. I’m gonna push myself so I have an extra die.
Rhi: I would recommend pushing yourself to get greater effect.
Minna: Okay. I can do that.
Kim: Okay, here we go.
Rhi: Beep beep.
Kim: I got 1.
Josie: I got 5.
Minna: I got a 6!
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Thank God. Sorry.
Josie: Phew.
Minna: So that’s like a crit, right? For greater effect?
Josie: Well, crit is two 6s.
Rhi: Well, no, but at greater effect.
Minna: I pushed for greater effect.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Ah.
Rhi: So, that is gonna get you up to a 13 out of 12.
Minna: [delighted gasp]
Rhi: Which will do the trick.
Kim: Nice.
Rhi: So, the two of you, Minx and Myra, tag team this series of witnesses, building your case of, you know, we’ve shown the weakness of these sworn statements and now we have this witness who saw The Umbra Hunters planting evidence and then we can connect The Umbra Hunters to this place and to Brogan. And you build this through-line.
Josie (as Minx): And with that–
Josie: Minx pushes up her glasses–
Josie (as Minx): The defence rests.
Rhi: The courtroom is just abuzz. Lady Drake leans back in her chair and just surveys the two of you, and then her eyes flick to the back of the room where Blaire is sitting. She nods and is like,
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Well. I will retire for my deliberations, and I believe I should have a verdict rather soon.
Rhi: And she nods and stands and goes back into her office. And yeah, the courtroom is abuzz. I think that all three of you get grabbed by different reporters for quotes at different points.
Minna: Beautiful.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): What would you like to know?
Josie: [giggles]
Rhi: Jesus.
Minna: [laughs] They’re gonna get very weird quotes from Blaire.
Rhi: Yeah, from the Blaire-Tira conglomerate.
Kim: Blira, please.
Rhi: ‘Blira’, oh Jesus. That’s a bad sign.
Josie: Minx kinda lets the façade crack a little bit and revels in the attention. [laughs]
Rhi: Oh, yeah. So, I think it’s about an hour, which in Duskwall is unbelievably long. Because it’s not a jury that has to deliberate, it’s one person making up their mind. So the fact that it takes an hour before she comes back out, like, everyone is on edge and as soon as she comes back out, the courtroom is just abuzz again. She sits down, folds her hands on the desk in front of her.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Well. This was a very difficult case. A great deal of evidence to consider. But, in the end, it appears that Gilbert Severin is not guilty of the charges against him.
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: And the crowd explodes.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Yeah!
Rhi: People are just losing their minds.
Josie: Tira explodes, too.
Rhi: Yeah, Tira and Blaire also. The Inspectors are just like, they don’t know exactly what to do with this, because they pretty much figured that he was just a done deal. Severin, throughout the case he was looking a little more impressed with you and he just kinda like gives you all a respectful nod of, like, ‘Alright, thanks’.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): We did it!
Josie: That fucking played out perfectly. Because whenever the protagonist in these situations has a courtroom scene, it always starts out fumbling and weird. And it definitely did that.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Josie: Thank you Kim.
Rhi: Yeah, and I think at some point Minx or Myra, or maybe both of you, look back at Lady Drake. And if you make eye contact, she just kind of smirks and mouths:
Rhi (as Lady Drake): We’ll be in touch.
Rhi: And then heads back into her office.
Kim: So, we’re definitely killing her at some point, right?
Josie: I mean, yes.
Rhi: [clapping with delight] I’m so glad I got you to wanting to kill within one session. Yay!
Josie: Can I get a way to follow her?
Rhi: You can try, but I am gonna require a roll for it, because there are Bluecoats around and you would have to be sneaking past them.
Josie: Okay. Alright, I’m gonna roll… sounds like Prowl is what it would be here.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I’m gonna do that. I’m not gonna push myself or anything, if I fail it’s not a big deal.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: But I did get a 6.
Rhi: Jesus Christ. Okay, so Minx, in the general chaos of the room, you’re able to slip away. And I think what it is, is that she has actually gone through her office and out to a hall behind it. So yeah, you follow her out into that hallway, which, like, it’s not super private, but right now there isn’t really anybody else around, everybody’s over in the courtroom. And she’s just walking away.
Josie: I actually want to catch up and talk to her.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie (as Minx): So, this is far from checkmate.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Indeed. Though you were quite impressive.
Josie (as Minx): Well, we did try. But you were trying for a very different prize at the end of this game than us.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): This trial is but one move in a larger endeavour.
Josie (as Minx): That is precisely what I was saying.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): I know that you have your principles and your beliefs, and that it is not going to take simply this one encounter to convince you. But everyone has a price, Minx. And someday, we’ll find yours.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps. And yet, you seek a very odd prize.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): I recognise talent where I see it.
Josie (as Minx): I’m not speaking of us.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): I recognise power where I see it, too.
Josie (as Minx): Is it really that simple for you? You need more?
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Spoken like someone who’s never had any.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps, though it’s unfortunate. I’d hoped there’d be a bit more character to this game.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Oh, I’m not going to reveal everything just yet. Where’s the fun in that?
Josie (as Minx): Just make sure that we do not tire of the game.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): I wouldn’t worry about that. Best of luck.
Rhi: And then she’s gonna stroll off.
Josie: I’ll let her. Minx will head back to everyone else.
Rhi: Yep. Alright, so let’s do downtime stuff. And I wanna start with Blaire.
Kim: So, I imagine my downtime scene is that I just bring Tira to the reconciled.
Rhi: Yeah, for sure. I’m going to have to talk to myself. So have you popped her out of your head yet, or are just carrying her–
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Yeah, as soon as we can separate, we’re out.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): That went pretty good!
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. It was weird having a body again.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I could tell.
Rhi (as Tira): I kinda liked it but, I mean, yeah. It was nice not being cold.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. I’m sorry.
Rhi (as Tira): But I didn’t… limbs are hard.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I get it now. I mean, I can try and hook you up with someone who actually wants to be possessed, if you want. I can ask around.
Rhi (as Tira): Wow, there are people who do that?
Kim (as Blaire): Some people are into it.
Rhi (as Tira): Is it like a kinky thing?
Kim (as Blaire): Sometimes it’s a kinky thing.
Rhi (as Tira): I don’t know if I wanna be into that. I think I just kinda like having a body.
Kim (as Blaire): Well I can let you think about it.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay. Who are these friends? I wanna meet your friends.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I’ll bring you to them.
Rhi (as Tira): Your dead ghost friends.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. They’re called the reconciled and they’re called that because they are people who have passed on who have still retained their minds. Like you!
Rhi (as Tira): Oh, me?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, so they can help you, you know, navigate this a little better and help you out with what you need. You know, you could be around like-minded people.
Rhi (as Tira): Can I, like, come hang out with you sometimes?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah!
Rhi (as Tira): Because you’re pretty cool.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, please! You know, once my house isn’t, you know, warded against ghosts, you can totally come and hang out. I have a cat. She would like you.
Rhi (as Tira): You have a cat?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, his name is Hex.
Rhi (as Tira): That’s awesome. That’s a really good name for a cat.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, he’s a cutie.
Rhi (as Tira): I think I might have had a cat…
Kim (as Blaire): Aww.
Minna: Oh.
Rhi (as Tira): I don’t remember. Oh well. Are we gonna make drugs for that dude?
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll talk about that. I think it’ll be very profitable. We can figure something out. But we can talk about that next time you come over.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Let me get you to your friends.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, unless you wanna do more with it, I think that’s good.
Kim: I guess. I mean, unless you wanted to talk to yourself?
Rhi: I don’t particularly like talking to myself as an NPC if I can avoid it.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, alright. I’ve given you all another cute friend.
Kim: Yay, and she’s a cute ghost.
Josie: Yay!
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, what are you doing with your free time?
Josie: Yeah, so I think I’m just gonna go chill with Nyryx for a bit.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Probably not a big, fancy date this time. It’s probably a cuddle night.
Rhi: Aww, just hanging out at her place?
Josie: Probably a cuddle night, yeah.
Rhi: Okay. So, yeah, Nyryx has the night off and she still has some gripes about work. Apparently someone new has been hired to handle the schedules, so it’s gotten a little better, but they’re still learning. So, you know, I’m picturing you’re cuddling in bed and she’s undoing the braids in your hair, and playing with your hair while you’re talking.
Josie: Aww, yay! Minx is gonna go into the score that just went down, because she’s proud of how it went down, and is like:
Josie (as Minx): I got to talk to the papers so much, I was getting so much attention! And yeah, even with Blaire’s thing, what with it happening willingly, it still worked out fine. Nicest spirit I’ve ever met, I’ll say. Still freaked me out though. It honestly looked like she was more drunk than anything. Anyway, but then Myra pulled in this witness–
Josie: And goes on like that.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m picturing that Nyryx is sitting behind Minx, so Minx can’t really see her expression, but she’s just, like, very wide-eyed. And she’s kind of like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Hmm, yeah. I’m glad that it all worked out for you. It sounds like it was quite an event.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed. It was exciting. And we got some good information, and it was like out of a dime novel.
Rhi (as Nyryx): What name did you use? I’ll look for you in the papers.
Josie (as Minx): Kyra Langston, attorney at law.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well I’ll be sure to clip it out and save it forever. Finally, some good news about you in the paper.
Josie: Minx is gonna whirl around for a kiss.
Rhi: Yeah. Oh, it’s so cute and so sad.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Oh no! Myra.
Minna: Hello.
Rhi: Hello.
Minna: Maybe what I do is check in with Jeren afterwards, to thank him.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: See how he feels about this whole business. I guess we can say that this is the vice I’m indulging, because I didn’t specify.
Rhi: I think that makes sense. So where do you wanna meet up with him? Back in the library?
Minna: I dunno, it’s either that or the café, or maybe we need to establish more locations. I dunno.
Rhi: Let’s go with the café. This is about the least conflicted that you’ve seen Jeren in a while when he’s come to meet you.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: He sits down and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): So, that went well.
Minna (as Myra): It did. Thank you for your advice, it was very helpful.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): And the list of people.
Rhi (as Jeren): It was all true, what you all were saying, right?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. Every word of it.
Rhi (as Jeren): Okay. Because, I mean, it’d be just as easy for both sides to make things up, I guess.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think we made things up. We did have to engage in a little bit of cheating. But only to bring out the truth.
Rhi (as Jeren): Was your friend okay?
Minna (as Myra): Oh. It’s okay, we just… a rather unconventional witness, but…
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah…
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know if you wanna hear the details.
Rhi (as Jeren): If you’re saying that, I definitely don’t. I know better than to ask questions after you say something like that.
Minna (as Myra): No, but she’s fine. She just had a little bit of trouble.
Rhi (as Jeren): Alright. Well, I’m glad this all worked out and he’s innocent. I haven’t heard yet if he’s gonna be reinstated.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I suppose it’s possible that he won’t be. But at least he’s not in Ironhook. Lady Drake could have put him away for a long time.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. You did good. You know, you could that professionally, if you wanted.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] I could, if I had any belief that the justice system was usually working towards good. Unfortunately, in this case, we were involved because we knew it wasn’t. And I think if she really, really wanted to win, she could have.
Rhi (as Jeren): Who? Lady Drake? Or the other lawyer?
Minna (as Myra): No, Drake.
Rhi (as Jeren): Oh. Well what was she winning? She was just deciding the case.
Minna (as Myra): Lady Drake has her own reasons to want Severin gone. Especially if he was looking into Mora.
Rhi (as Jeren): Oh… okay. I don’t see the connection there, but I’ll take your word for it, I guess.
Minna (as Myra): Steer away from them if they decide to start asking about me, that’s all I’ll say.
Rhi (as Jeren): Okay, I’ll do my best. I don’t really talk to people with Lord or Lady in front of their name too often, so it shouldn’t be that hard.
Minna (as Myra): No, I guess not that often. Just be careful. And I suppose we should be a little more careful about meeting up, when we do.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): We might have to set up a better system for getting in contact.
Rhi (as Jeren): Alright. Well, I’ll try and think of something.
Minna (as Myra): I’ll put my head to it as well.
Rhi: And I think we cut outside a little while later and see the two of them head off. And then the camera kind of pans over, and there’s a silhouette of someone watching them.

Rhi: The prosecutor declines to cross-examine.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Aw, come on!
Rhi: Because she’s just like ‘I cannot do any worse to this case than they just did to themselves, I’m good’.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): I will totally be cross eliminated. I can do that.
[laughter]
Rhi: She’s just clearly trying not laugh.
Kim (as Tira via Blaire): Please cross eliminate me!"

"Season 2, Episode 20: The Hired Killer Score Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly.
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. Thank you so much for listening. And if I saw you at GenCon this past weekend, thank you for taking the time to come up and say hello. I was probably very awkward about accepting your compliments, but meeting fans in person is always amazing. Thanks to everyone who said hi to Minna and I.
September is International Podcast Month. I’m going to be on a couple episodes, one as a player in Good Society, and the other as the host of a discussion about accessibility in RPGs. I’m really proud of both and I can’t wait for you to hear them. And there will be so many more awesome non-fiction, audio drama and actual play episodes posted. Visit InternationalPodcastMonth.com to learn more.
We are coming up on the end of Season Two. This is the second-to-last episode of the season and I do need to give a content warning for it. The Magpies end up allying with a pretty terrible person in this episode and while it doesn’t happen on screen, there are references to torture and murder. The exact time stamps will be in the show notes [and marked in this transcript] and you can pretty safely skip over that section and still understand what happened in the episode without it.
Next, I’d like to tell you about this month’s featured charity.
The Trans Language Primer is a resource that compiles information around the language used by and about LGBTQ+ communities. It’s a historical record and a living document, continually updated so that people within the community can dig deeper into identities and labels and people without, especially medical professionals, social service workers and those in the media, can learn the accepted terminology to address and refer to people in these communities. You can support their future work, which includes plans for translations into other languages, by supporting their Patreon. Or, if you prefer a one-time donation, you can visit editor-in-chief Greyson’s Ko-Fi. Links will be in the show notes.
For our US listeners, please continue to contact your representatives. There are so many issues that need to be addressed, but if you’re not sure where to start, contacting your congress-person in the House of Representatives about impeachment hearings, or your senators about gun control bills and election security is a good place to start.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [00.02.46]
Rhi: We open up on a street in Nightmarket. It’s early afternoon. Who has normally been going to pick up messages from The Hound’s Paw?
Kim: You know, I’m down for being the one to do it, just to switch it up a little. I feel like Myra does a lot of the correspondence stuff, I think it would neat to have Blaire do it for Rigney.
Minna: Yeah, and I think Blaire’s, like, super attached to Rigney.
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: She loves Rigney so much.
Minna: Yeah, not that Myra doesn’t, but I think Blaire, it would do her good to see him more.
Kim: Yeah, Blaire’s a softie.
Rhi: So, Blaire is making her way down this street towards Nightmarket. You turn onto the street that The Hound’s Paw is on, and as soon as you step onto the street, somebody darts out in front of you and you kinda jump back. It takes you a second to recognise that it is Sophia.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh!
Rhi (as Sophia): Oh good, I’m glad that I caught you. Come here, come here.
Rhi: And she herds you off back around the corner.
Kim (as Blaire): What’s this about?
Rhi (as Sophia): Rigney sent me out to watch for whoever was coming today.
Kim (as Blaire): Is he okay?
Rhi (as Sophia): He’ll be fine. The Bluecoats are doing a raid and he didn’t want you to get caught.
Kim (as Blaire): No, we gotta go! What do you mean–
Rhi (as Sophia): No.
Kim (as Blaire): Sophia!
Rhi (as Sophia): He didn’t want you to get in trouble. They’re just looking for information about you and he didn’t want you to get in trouble or get caught.
Kim (as Blaire): But what if they hurt him?
Rhi (as Sophia): They’re not going to hurt him. They’re just… [sighs] making a point.
Kim (as Blaire): So what can we do?
Rhi (as Sophia): Come back in a few hours?
Kim (as Blaire): I’ll get the rest of the gang and we’ll meet back here, okay?
Rhi (as Sophia): Alright.
Kim (as Blaire): Stay out of sight.
Rhi (as Sophia): I’ll be fine. You are the one that needs to be careful going back.
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t worry about it.
Kim: And Blaire puts up her hood to hide her face.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire gets back, like, Blaire has been gone for ten minutes when she comes back in, which is way too short of a time for her to have actually completed the errand of collecting messages.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, is there a travel spell we need to know about?
Kim (as Blaire): No. The Bluecoats are doing a raid at The Hound’s Paw.
Josie (as Minx): Again?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. They’re trying to find some dirt about us and I’m worried about them harassing Rigney. We need to meet her back there so she can tell us what’s going on.
Josie (as Minx): Alright. It is not a full raid? They’re just looking?
Kim (as Blaire): From what Sophia told me, but I’m not holding my breath. It could turn into a full raid if they wanted to.
Minna (as Myra): It’s still other people getting caught up in a search that’s ultimately for us.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Exactly. So we gotta put a stop to it.
Minna (as Myra): I agree.
Josie (as Minx): I didn’t think we had garnered so much heat again.
Minna (as Myra): Are you kidding me?
Josie (as Minx): We had been pretty clean. We were worrying about The Circle. I was looking forward to having a break with them off our back, rather than just replacing them with The Bluecoats again.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, beggars can’t be choosers. Let’s go.
Josie (as Minx): Are you certain it is clear enough that it is safe for us to go back?
Josie: While she’s clearly getting ready to go back. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): In the proximity. I still wouldn’t get too close.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, and it wouldn’t do to engage The Bluecoats where they expect to find us.
Kim (as Blaire): Exactly.
Josie (as Minx): Still, I suppose we can watch and scheme.
Minna (as Myra): Perhaps we can direct their attention elsewhere.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s what I’m hoping.
Rhi: So, the three of you gear up and troop off down into the streets. When you get back to the corner where Sophia was, she’s not there anymore. She’s expecting you back in a few hours, so she’s not gonna stand there the whole time. But you can from that corner peer down the street and you can see a couple, like, paddy wagons, basically, parked outside of The Hound’s Paw. There’s a number of Bluecoats milling around outside. It looks like they’re doing a search of the place.
Kim (as Blaire): Won’t be good for business if they stay much longer.
Josie (as Minx): Forgive me if this is juvenile, but I have a strong desire to mess with their paddy wagons in some capacity.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Minx–
Josie (as Minx): I realise that it’s unwise, since that will only keep them here longer, but…
Kim (as Blaire): I wanna mess them up real bad too, but we gotta keep our heads down, considering.
Minna (as Myra): Considering that they’re here looking for us.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Suppose they do get rougher with Rigney or the patrons?
Kim (as Blaire): If anything happens I won’t hesitate to go in there. They hurt Rigney, it’s over. But for now we just have to watch.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. Let’s watch.
Rhi: So, about ten minutes pass. More Bluecoats file out of The Hound’s Paw, one of the wagons leaves. Eventually, you see several more Bluecoats climb into the remaining wagon and then one is standing in front of the door. Looks like they’re talking to someone inside. Then they climb into the wagon and it rumbles away. And, yeah, it goes down to the far end of the street and it turns out of sight.
Kim: Blaire is gonna rush into The Hound’s Paw.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: So, you rush inside and it’s not great. You know, it’s a bar, it always kinda smells like alcohol, but this is thick with the smell of booze because there’s a bunch of broken bottles. There’s alcohol spilled all over the floor, there’s a lot of broken glass. Several of the tables and chairs have been knocked over. Rigney is leaning against the bar, pinching the bridge of his nose, and is giving orders to his staff that’s there. Sophia is coming out of the back room with a mop and bucket and a couple others are starting to sweep up the broken glass. And he raises his head when Blaire comes running in.
Kim (as Blaire): Rigney!
Kim: Blaire’s gonna go round the counter and hug him.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, uh, hey kid.
Rhi: He looks over to Sophia.
Rhi (as Rigney): I thought… were you supposed to tell them to wait a few hours?
Rhi: She’s like:
Rhi (as Sophia): I did!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: He’s still just patting Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): I…
Josie (as Minx): Blaire’s not one to wait.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you okay?
Rhi (as Rigney): I’m fine, I’m fine. Just a few coin worth of damage. They didn’t hurt any of us, just broke a bunch of shit.
Kim (as Blaire): [mutters] Motherfuckers.
[laughter]
Rhi: He ruffles your hair and is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): I’m afraid I’m not gonna be able to get you all your usual today.
Kim (as Blaire): Forget about that. We’re here to help.
Rhi (as Rigney): I mean, it’s just The Bluecoats, you know. This is what they do.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi (as Rigney): Unfortunately I think you all may have to continue to keep your distance. You haven’t been back here in a while and they still came and trashed the place looking for information.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Kim (as Blaire): What if we can make them stop? You know, throw off our scent somewhere? Send them on a different lead.
Rhi (as Rigney): I mean, that would help.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, Myra, any ideas?
Josie (as Minx): Not off-hand. Was there any particular issues they cited for their search? Or just looking for us?
Rhi (as Rigney): Uh, I mean, looking for you. Let’s see. They mentioned that clinic you all hit, the Ironhook thing, some break-in up in Brightstone, apparently?
Kim (as Blaire): Er… yeah, that was us.
Rhi: [laughs] He’s just, like, ticking off on his fingers your many high crimes and misdemeanors.
Minna (as Myra): Are they trying to get you for conspiracy, or abetting?
Rhi (as Rigney): Nah, this was just a shakedown to try and scare me to cough up information on you.
Minna (as Myra): So they don’t have anything on you.
Kim (as Blaire): Not yet, but if they keep pressing him, who knows what they’ll do? It’s just a few bottles of alcohol now, what happens next time?
Rhi (as Rigney): What are you talking about? I’m an upstanding citizen with a perfectly clean record.
Josie (as Minx): But as we know, The Bluecoats are not actually for the upstanding citizen.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah.
Rhi: He steps out from around the bar as Sophia comes in to mop back there, and I think he’s actually gonna go to the front door and flip the sign around to closed. He’s like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Probably not opening up tonight. [sighs]
Minna: I think if there’s work to be done, Myra’s just automatically helping out with it.
Rhi: Yeah, righting tables and chairs and stuff.
Minna: Yeah, she’s definitely just kind of doing that while they talk.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): If they keep doing shakedowns like this and you lose business, I’m worried about The Hound’s Paw being able to stay afloat.
Rhi (as Rigney): Don’t worry about me, Blaire. I will be fine. I have–
Kim (as Blaire): Well I’m gonna worry! Sorry, but I’m gonna worry. This isn’t okay and it’s because of us. So we have to do something to fix it.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well,
Rhi: And I think he’s gonna push himself up to sit on the bar,
Rhi (as Rigney): You said you wanted to pin it on somebody else, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Rhi (as Rigney): And stick it to The Bluecoats.
Kim (as Blaire): Always.
Rhi (as Rigney): I’m not exactly sure which of your many crimes you could pin on him, but there’s a Bluecoat Lieutenant by the name of Norris Boyd. He’s the guy who framed Nevan.
Minna (as Myra): Hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): So you’re thinking we could get the heat off Nevan as well.
Rhi (as Rigney): I mean, that was several years ago. I think that ship has sailed. But, you know, if you can implicate him in something that you were doing. Now, it would have to be something pretty substantial, because he’s known to be pretty corrupt and the powers that be just sorta let him do what he wants. So, it wouldn’t have to be something that, you know–
Kim (as Blaire): Well, we do have a diversified portfolio. I don’t think we’ll have any trouble with that.
[laughter]
Minna: I love the idea that Blaire just picked up a lot of lingo during the Langdon Imports score.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yes she did.
Rhi: Oh God.
Rhi (as Rigney): I mean, that is true, you do have a lot of crimes to pick from that you could try to pin on this guy, but yeah, it’s gonna have to be something pretty big to get the Bluecoat higher-ups to turn on him.
Kim (as Blaire): What about our Ironhook break-in? Do you think that would be enough?
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, that would probably do the trick, if you could somehow connect him to it.
Josie (as Minx): That would be fairly easy to set up. It’s simply a matter of he is corrupt and we gained information and passage from him.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, does he sell information?
Rhi (as Rigney): I don’t know the specifics of what he gets up to. I mean, he might sell information on the side. He’s got a reputation as more of an extortion, smash-and-grab, terrorize the neighborhood sort, but…
Kim (as Blaire): But it isn’t hard to frame that a Bluecoat would be in Ironhook. They’re there all the time.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, I mean that’s possible.
Kim (as Blaire): We just need convincing evidence.
Minna (as Myra): Pretty tall order, but we can look into it.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): I really do think it’s doable.
Minna (as Myra): I think that’s the easiest hook in for us.
Josie (as Minx): This is all, of course, based on the assumption that Rigney is putting us after this fellow of his own will, and not on the strings of another.
Rhi: Rigney just kinda goes very, very still and looks at Minx. Yeah, I think he just slides off the bar and is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): It’s your choice if you wanna follow up on this or not. I gotta clean up my bar.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re following up, no matter what.
Josie (as Minx): It does seem like a good target and we thank you, Rigney, for it. I just wanna make sure all concerns are covered from now on.
Rhi: He’s heading into the back and he just says over his shoulder:
Rhi (as Rigney): I’ve kept an eye on this guy for a while. I’m not doing this because anybody’s making me, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): I assumed as much.
Rhi: You can tell he’s not lying. Your lie detection radar does not go off.
Josie: Yay!
Rhi: But yeah, he goes into the back without really saying bye. You kinda hurt his feelings.
Kim (as Blaire): Be careful.
Rhi: I think he just kinda waves a hand over his shoulder and goes through the door.
Josie: Now, we do have some connections within The Bluecoats, right, who may be able to get us more information?
Kim: We have Jeren.
Rhi: I don’t remember if I actually had Rigney say it, but this guy operates in Crow’s Foot primarily, so you might be able to poke around there. But yeah, where do you wanna start?
Kim: I think we should start with the Bluecoat connections.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Alright. So, Myra?
Minna: I guess once they’ve decided on this course of action she kinda peels off from them as they’re walking back through the city and says:
Minna (as Myra): I’m gonna try and get some information, I’ll be back.
Kim (as Blaire): Where are you going?
Minna (as Myra): I’m going to meet a contact.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. And if we don’t hear from you? Where do meet you? Where do we find you, what time?
Minna: She’s not used to being asked this because I think they’ve only recently kind of got to this point.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m playing into my trauma of being paranoid.
Minna: Oh, bless.
Josie: Aww.
Minna: I love it, it’s perfect.
Minna (as Myra): Uh… let’s see. We probably should set up.
Kim (as Blaire): Like, if we don’t hear from you in, I don’t know, two hours, where do we find you?
Josie (as Minx): Well, sundown is approaching. So I think we should set, perhaps, meeting back at The Nest soon after sundown? It wouldn’t do to be out at a dangerous time. We can gather more tomorrow if need be.
Minna: Also that’s a good question, if I need to see him immediately I don’t know where I go. Because I can’t just drop in on him anymore.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean you’d basically have to send him a note and be like, ‘I need to talk to you ASAP’.
Minna: Yeah, I think I pay a small child to bring him a note, basically.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I think we’ve been meeting at, like, the lunch spot.
Rhi: You’ve met in a few different places. You could ask to meet somewhere closer to his office, so it doesn’t take him as long. Because the lunch spot is in Nightmarket and he works in Charterhall. So you could–
Minna: Let me look at the map and find a spot in Charterhall. She could just be like meet me here.
Rhi: Yeah. There could be a little park or something on the river.
Minna: Yeah, I think we’ll do that. We’ll meet in… give me a park name.
Rhi: Mistway Park. So, Jeren shows up, I think pretty quickly. I assume your note conveyed a great deal of urgency. And he’s still in his blue coat, because he came straight from work. He comes hustling over.
Rhi (as Jeren): Hi. I got here as fast as I could. What’s going on?
Minna (as Myra): I just need some information. We’ve got trouble with a friend that I’m hoping to solve.
Rhi (as Jeren): [hesitantly] Okay.
Rhi: he sits down on the bench next to you.
Rhi (as Jeren): Um, okay. Well, what sort of information?
Minna (as Myra): So how much do you know about Lieutenant Norris Boyd?
Rhi: Gimme a roll and let’s find out. Almost certainly Consort.
Minna: Because I am talking to a friend and I am being fairly honest with him.
Rhi: As honest as Myra ever is with Jeren.
Minna: She’s honest. Just selectively.
Rhi: Fairly honest with him.
Kim: More honest than she probably should be to any Bluecoat. I’ll just put that out there.
Minna: Yeah, I think her friends would be super uncomfortable with all of this.
Rhi: Yep.
Minna: For the record, I think she did tell her friends, ‘If I’m not back in two hours, I should be at Mistway Park’.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: 6.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna (as Myra): How much do you know about Lieutenant Norris Boyd?
Rhi (as Jeren): He runs a few squads in Crow’s Foot. Doesn’t have the best reputation, from what I understand.
Minna (as Myra): Believably a criminal?
Rhi (as Jeren): There’s a few, you know, disciplinary marks in his file. Got too rough bringing in suspects, that sort of thing.
Rhi: At this point, with a 6 you can just ask a bunch of follow-up questions.
Minna: Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Could you see him passing information to people who pay enough?
Rhi (as Jeren): Er… maybe? I don’t, I mean, maybe. Lieutenant salaries are better than what I make, but, you know, for the amount of work that they have to do, it’s a little on the low side. Yeah. He might.
Minna (as Myra): This Lieutenant, does he have connections in Ironhook?
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, I think he did a rotation there a couple months ago and just got cycled back into Crow’s Foot.
Minna: Out of character, a couple months ago. That does coincide with our–
Rhi: Yeah, that lines up pretty neatly.
Kim: Ooh!
Minna: So I think Myra, like, her lips twitch like she’s suppressing a smile.
Minna (as Myra): Very interesting.
Rhi (as Jeren): Why do you wanna know?
Minna (as Myra): He’s bad news. We just wanna make people see it.
Rhi (as Jeren): [sighs]
Minna (as Myra): You told me yourself he’s not got a good reputation and that’s saying something.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, I mean, he’s got like I said, some disciplinary notes in his file. But a lot of Bluecoats do.
Minna (as Myra): Disciplinary notes? You have to do something noisy to get a disciplinary note as a Bluecoat, from what I understand.
Rhi (as Jeren): I mean…
Minna (as Myra): This guy’s also known for other pursuits besides being a Bluecoat, to people who know about that kind of thing. It’s just that nobody’s cared up ‘til now.
Rhi (as Jeren): I mean, I… [sighs]
Minna (as Myra): And if it helps anything, it’s about our safety and the safety of our friends.
Rhi (as Jeren): I mean, that helps a little. And you’ve mostly been right about people so far, so just don’t get me mixed up in it.
Minna (as Myra): I’m not gonna get you mixed up in it. I would never give your name.
Rhi (as Jeren): Alright. There wasn’t anything else, was there?
Minna (as Myra): Just be careful. I might be a little scarce around the regular visits, just because… well, I’ll be a little scarce around the regular visits. But I’ll try and keep up when I can. I just wanna keep you out of this.
Rhi (as Jeren): Alright. Um. Are you gonna be okay?
Minna (as Myra): I am going to be as okay as I possibly can be. I’m going to do my best. [laughs] That’s all I can promise you, Jeren.
Rhi (as Jeren): That is probably not as reassuring are you were hoping.
Minna (as Myra): No, I know it’s not reassuring, but I don’t have anything true to tell you that is reassuring. Things are dangerous right now. I’ll be smart and do my best.
Rhi: Alright. I think he’s gonna, like, stand up and brush off his coat, and be like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Well, I should get back. I’ll see ya when I see ya, I guess.
Minna (as Myra): See ya when I see ya.
Rhi: So off he goes. So you’ve got a bit of information on this Lieutenant. Minx? You had an idea that involved an Inspector’s disguise.
Josie: Yes. But honestly I think talking to Severin might be a better idea. He, despite being a possessor ghost, is pretty good at his job and reasonably honest, right?
Rhi: Previously established, in a group of people who are known for being incorruptible, he is kind of a paladin type. Like, he’s this poor lawful good bastard in this godforsaken city.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: God bless lawful good characters.
Rhi: So yeah, if you wanted to chat with Severin, you could definitely do that.
Josie: Yeah, I’m trying to think of my angle here, because I think my angle might just be, like, ‘Hey, what would you need to put this guy away?’
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Because why not, right? He’s already kinda corrupt, there’s just not a lot there.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Right.
Josie: Now I’m just thinking if Minx would be too afraid to talk to Severin about it.
Kim: I can come and hold your hand.
Josie: That would be adorable.
Kim: Let’s do it.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: Alright. His apartment is probably the best place to track him down, I think.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. So, the two of you head over to Severin’s apartment. From your previous investigations you know which one is his.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Head upstairs, knock on the door and you hear, like, footsteps inside and the door opens. It’s got a chain across, and it’s just open a crack, and he peers out and sees the two of you. And is just like:
Rhi (as Severin): Um… hello?
Josie (as Minx): Good evening. Sorry to bother you, but we do have some urgent work-related business.
Rhi: I think he peers past the two of you to see that the hallway is clear and is like:
Rhi (as Severin): Alright.
Rhi: Opens up the door and lets you in. Man, what does Severin’s apartment look like?
Kim: I think it is very bare. I think it’s only like the bare essentials kind of thing. A very basic desk, you know, not a lot in terms of decoration or personality. Just very hardy and humble.
Rhi: Yeah. I think he does have a couple, like, personal touches. But the fact that there’s only a few makes them stand out a lot more.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: I think he’s got a pretty nice braided rug on the floor by his desk. I think that it’s a very neat and orderly space. He keeps his place pretty clean.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: He lets you in, closes the door behind you and then kinda moves to stand in the center of the room. Sort of preventing you from moving more than a few feet into the apartment. He’s like, ‘I will let you in, but this is a little weird’. He’s like:
Rhi (as Severin): Uh… I didn’t really get a chance to thank you properly. I’m still on administrative leave, but it’s looking like I’ll actually get my job back, which is impressive. So thanks for that.
Josie (as Minx): It is not issue, and thank you for doing your job, I suppose.
Kim (as Blaire): And not selling us out in the process.
Rhi (as Severin): Well, I mean, selling you out wouldn’t have helped me any. So, what can I do for ya?
Josie (as Minx): There’s a Lieutenant, one Norris Boyd. You know of him?
Rhi: Gimme a roll and let’s find out.
Josie: Alright.
Kim: Would you like an assist?
Josie: If you’re willing to give it.
Kim: Yeah, I’ve got the stress to spare.
Rhi: Doing a Consort?
Josie: Yep. I got a 5.
Rhi (as Severin): Norris Boyd… yeah, he’s a Bluecoat Lieutenant. Kind of a piece of shit, I think. But that’s most of them, so…
Kim (as Blaire): Well. We’re looking for a specific brand of shit.
Josie (as Minx): As much as I don’t care for that metaphor, he has been very loud, made a bit of a stink around things–
Kim (as Blaire): [giggles] Sorry.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, Blaire, you are welcome.
Kim (as Blaire): Poop.
[laughter]
Josie: Hold on, I’m gonna need a second.
Rhi: I have to say I’m impressed that it took us until almost the end of Season Two to get to a bunch of poop jokes, so good on us.
Kim: I’m so happy.
Minna: Better than most of our RPG groups, if we’re being real here.
Josie (as Minx): He’s been very loud and, even given the profession, has only been marked for minor disciplinary action. And frankly we are tired of it and we are wondering what you would need to find to put him away finally.
Rhi (as Severin): Oh, interesting. Can you narrow it down any in terms of what he’s done?
Josie (as Minx): Outright brutalizing citizens.
Kim (as Blaire): And even more so than that, we’re looking to see if he had any connection with that Ironhook break-in that happened a couple months ago.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi: I think he looks at the two of you for a second and arches an eyebrow and is like:
Rhi (as Severin): I think that you would know if he was involved in that better than I would.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re trying to frame the guy. That’s what we’re doing here.
Rhi (as Severin): Ah.
Josie (as Minx): Well, if we are simply coming right out with it, then yes. That is what we are trying to do.
Rhi (as Severin): I mean, look, sometimes you know someone’s guilty, you just don’t have the evidence for it, and you maybe have to fabricate a few things. Happens.
Josie (as Minx): Are you sure you wouldn’t be more inclined to our kind of work, with that attitude?
Rhi (as Severin): Eh. Nah. The Inspectors suit me just fine. Alright, connecting him to that. You’d need some kind of paper trail connecting him to the criminals who did this break-in. I think if you could swing it, evidence that he had been paid off, that he’d gotten kind of an influx of coin. Witnesses would be good, if you had people who could connect him to any of you, or to the scene of the crime.
Kim (as Blaire): Stabby girl could vouch for us.
Rhi: Stabby girl?
Kim: Do you remember the girl with the knife?
Rhi: Oh shit, you’re right.
Kim and Minna: Yeah!
Rhi: Damn. What a callback! Holy shit. I don’t remember her name.
Josie: I still don’t remember. Oh, her!
Rhi: Yeah. Did she ever give you a name?
Minna: I don’t know if she ever gave us a name.
Rhi: Holy shit. Okay. That’s okay, if she didn’t give you a name that means I don’t have to try and remember it.
Kim: Um… was it Frosty?
Rhi: Wow, what a blast from the past. Yeah, I think it might have been.
Kim: Because I remember making a joke about ‘stay frosty’.
Rhi: Yes. Yes! You’re right, the name she gave you…
Minna: Yeah, she was offended.
Rhi: I’m looking, because I know I just pulled her name off the alias list. Frost.
Kim: Frost. Yep. Yeah, if we could find her, and say, like, ‘Hey you owe us for us breaking you out,’ she might be down. If we can convince her.
Rhi (as Severin): If you’ve got somebody who was there the night of the breakout, I mean, if it’s somebody who broke out, getting her to testify.
Minna: Testify in exchange?
Rhi (as Severin): If I’m the one running this case, I could be willing to cut a deal with her.
Kim: Well, first we have to track her down. She kinda, you know, disappeared into the night.
Rhi (as Severin): Well, if you are able to find her, let her know that as long as she doesn’t confess to any other crimes in my presence, I’ll cut a deal.
Kim (as Blaire): We may have a deal on our hands.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, this sounds like a sound plan.
Rhi (as Severin): Yeah, if you can get me any evidence, hopefully I’ll be back from leave soon and I can start on this case. But, yeah, you’ll need to make it pretty ironclad so when I start working on it I can put all the pieces together.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll do everything we can.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed.
Rhi (as Severin): Alright. Well, good luck.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you!
Rhi: He still seems a little bit like, ‘Well, this is a little odd, this is not how I normally operate, but okay’.
Kim: Adult life is already so goddamn weird.
Rhi: [laughs] Yep. So he’ll see the two of you out.
Josie: Actually, as we’re leaving, Minx is gonna kinda pause for a second and say:
Minna (as Myra): No need to answer this one if it is prying. But recently this one shared a condition similar to yours willingly. Is that the same with you?
Rhi (as Severin): Willingly?
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi (as Severin): Nope.
Josie (as Minx): [sharp inhale]
Josie: Minx is kinda gonna get a little bit of fear in her eyes and say:
Josie (as Minx): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, thank you very much Mr. Severin, we’ll be taking our leave now. It was so nice catching up with you, and good luck with your… everything. Bye!
Josie (as Minx): Yes, quite. Good evening.
Kim: I’m pulling Minx through the door.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: Yeah, because I don’t think you’ve ever actually asked him how the situation came about.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: And every time he gets close to explaining, you’re like, ‘Oh never mind, bye!’
Kim: Oh, I’m gonna ask him someday.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I wasn’t gonna ask specifics, she just wanted to know whether it was like, a willing situation or not.
Rhi: It’s super duper not. The ghost is piloting around the body of the guy who killed him.
Josie: Oh. Interesting.
Rhi: It’s a revenge thing. Yeah.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: So you’ve hit upon the idea of tracking down Frost. You don’t really know where she is or what she’s up to. So yeah, where do you wanna start in terms of tracking her down?
Josie: Who would we know that knows a stabby girl?
Rhi: You have connections with both The Gondoliers and The Cabbies, and they kinda get all over the city.
Kim: Are we in the good graces of any kind of faction or group that is a little bit seedier?
Josie: Are we in the good graces of any faction?
Kim: True.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah that’s a better question. No.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Well, actually no. I take that back. You and The Silver Nails have an accord.
Minna: As long as we don’t burn down The Lost District.
Josie: I do like asking The Gondoliers. Like, our gang and theirs isn’t an exclusive partnership, right?
Rhi: No.
Josie: Like, they do work for other groups. So they might just have, I dunno, done a getaway for Frost before, or something like that.
Rhi: Yeah. Both of those are completely plausible options.
Josie: Yeah. I think Minx is probably gonna ask through Kay to speak with… who was the person in charge again? It’s been a while.
Rhi: Eisele.
Josie: To speak with Eisele, and then of course on the way there’s much flirting to be had.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: Go ahead and make your roll.
Josie: 5.
Rhi: It probably takes about a day. You have to go and ask her, like, ‘Hey, we’re looking for this specific person. Can you help us out?’ and she’s like:
Rhi (as Eisele): I will put out the word, but it’s gonna take a little while.
Rhi: But she does come back to you eventually with information that they’ve given her some rides around the city. She’s been doing a lot of work over in Silkshore and they suspect that she’s been doing work with The Wraiths. They’re kind of one of the bigger players in Silkshore specifically right now.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: So Myra and Blaire, we’re gonna go chat with The Silver Nails.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Sounds good.
Rhi: So, yeah, the two of you head up to The Mustang. Go ahead and one of you make a roll, see how this goes.
Minna: That is a 6.
Kim: Nice.
Rhi: So I think Tuhan just spots you across the bar and makes her way over, you know, checking in. And when you tell her what you’re looking for, they actually were looking to hire Frost for different work, but she is currently occupied doing something for The Wraiths that involves breaking in to… what’s the name of the hotel?
Kim: The…
Josie: The Duskwall Sheraton.
Kim: Spooky (? 35.
Rhi: [pause] Minna, would you like to try?
[laughter]
Rhi: Minna, I am placing all my hopes on you.
Minna: One second, you’ll have to give me a second. The Karstas Arms? (? 35.24)
Rhi: Sure. She is apparently doing some work for The Wraiths down at The Karstas Arms Hotel. Near Gaddoc Rail. They don’t know the specifics of what she’s doing. Tuhan guesses it probably involves stabbing someone.
Kim (as Blaire): That sounds on brand.
Rhi: And I think she’ll also tell you that it was happening pretty soon, like in the next couple nights. So sometime in the next couple days, Frost is going to be at this hotel to do a stabbing.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, we could always stay at the inn for the next couple days while we wait for her.
Rhi: You could, yeah.
Josie (as Minx): That’s true.
Kim (as Blaire): But do we have the coin for it?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I have money.
Minna (as Myra): That’s true.
Rhi: Yeah, if Minx wants to.
Josie: Minx blowing a bunch of money on a few nights in an expensive hotel is honestly perfectly in character and I would do that.
Rhi: I think it is a pretty nice hotel.
Minna: [giggles] But there’s only one bed.
[laughter]
Kim: Yes! Playing into the trope! My fan fiction!
Josie: Yup, doing it.
Rhi: Here’s the thing; I think that even a couple–, so let’s say that it’s two nights.
Kim: We are sharing a bed. There are not enough beds, whatever we do.
Rhi: I think that it’s probably only gonna be one coin.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna bankroll it, because as soon as someone says The Karstas Arms to her, she’s just gonna slap a piece of paper and pen out of her purse or something and start doing the math about it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yeah, so, Minx is like:
Minna (as Myra): Regrettably the penthouse was already booked on such short notice, perhaps while we are there we shall leave a reservation for next year.
Kim (as Blaire): Next year?
Josie (as Minx): But I bought a room for a few nights. This is still The Karstas Arms, it will suffice. And yes, next year. You do need to think ahead on vacations, generally. This is a business trip, but–
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, this is business for us. We’re not taking a vacation.
Josie (as Minx): My conscience is trying to lead me towards doing both, but business first, business first, Minx.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, it doesn’t have to be a vacation, but you can mix business with pleasure.
Josie (as Minx): You may wish to revise that, since the best I could do was a single bed.
Kim (as Blaire): [double take]
Rhi: I think we cut to all of you walking into this hotel.
Kim: With our little bags.
Rhi: Yeah, with your little overnight bags. Tell me about the lobby of this place. What’s it look like? Everybody give me a detail.
Kim: Ooh, I have one.
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: There is a statue in the center that is part of a fountain, and it looks alarmingly similar to Kevin.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Hmm. Feels like home.
Josie: It’s not, like, a gauche place. It almost kind of has a lodge quality to it.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: Oh, interesting.
Josie: It’s still a big hotel, but something that’ll appeal to the more rugged sort of people while still being super upscale.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: So kind of like a ski lodge kind of thing.
Josie: Yeah, exactly.
Rhi: A really high-end ski lodge in a place where there is no skiing whatsoever.
Josie: Exactly.
Rhi: I love it.
Josie: Hey, I mean, hunting Deathlands beasts might be a thing for the people who are way too rich to have anything better to do.
Rhi: Yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense, yeah.
Kim: There’s a game room.
Rhi: Yeah, like a hunting lodge. There’s a taxidermy ash bear in the smoking lounge.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Who did this to you?
Minna: Aww.
Rhi: Minna, what’s your addition?
Minna: I feel like there’s a shuttle service, with like goat-pulled carts, that’s included in the fee.
Josie: [bleats]
Rhi: Yes, so there’s a station outside where the carriages can–
Minna: This is an airport hotel as well.
Kim: It is!
Rhi: It is. But it’s a really, really nice one. This is where rich people stay. Cool. I love this. This is great. The three of you enter this hotel. Minx checks you in under whatever flowery pseudonyms she selected for you.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: And you head up to your room, which is on the fifth floor. I think it’s a six-storey hotel, so you’re just under the penthouse.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: And it’s a very nice room. There’s a big window with a nice view of the rail station. There’s a mini-bar, there’s a little seating area with a couch and couple armchairs and a little table, there’s a desk and there is indeed one king-size bed.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, so… I’ll be on the floor, and–
Rhi: There’s a couch, Blaire! [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but Myra will take the couch, Minx will take the bed because she paid for it, she checked us in and also she’s tallest and likes nice things. And I can sleep on the floor.
Josie (as Minx): That’s true, but… no.
Rhi: [laughs] The bed is like 18 feet across. It’s not actually that big, but it’s a huge bed.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, there is space for all three of us. You know that, yes?
Kim (as Blaire): [hesitantly] I’m a kicker… I kinda…
Minna (as Myra): Would you be comfortable on the couch?
Kim (as Blaire): … I’d be comfortable on the floor…
Minna (as Myra): Do you want to sleep on the floor?
Kim (as Blaire): No, but if I got into a bed with you guys, I don’t want you waking up with bruises.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, we are gonna be up a good portion of the night anyway.
Kim (as Blaire): Well can we at least get room service?
Minna and Rhi: [laugh]
Josie (as Minx): Of course we can get room service. Are you kidding? Yes, of course we are getting room service, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Kim: And Blaire’s gonna flop onto the bed.
Josie (as Minx): Me enjoying nice things does not mean you two do not get to enjoy nice things.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, Myra, come here.
Minna (as Myra): Yes?
Kim (as Blaire): Come on, come on the bed.
Minna (as Myra): Okay, okay.
Minna: [laughs] Wait, she’s sitting on the bed and telling me to sit on the bed?
Kim: Yeah, Blaire’s gonna pull you down until you’re lying down next to her.
Minna: Okay.
Josie and Minna: [laugh]
Kim (as Blaire): Ah, isn’t it soft?
Rhi: It’s a really nice, soft bed.
Kim (as Blaire): We could just fall asleep here forever.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): See? Isn’t it better to choose the bed?
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, come here! You won’t know it until you’re lying on it.
Josie: I think Minx will try to, like, daintily sit down and then Blaire just pulls her flat. And she’s like:
Josie (as Minx): Ah!
Minna: I feel like Blaire’s in the center.
Kim and Rhi: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): [sighs] Okay, so let’s take a nap, we’ll get some room service and then we’ll have a little, you know, stay up all night thing. Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, you have some free time right now to just sort of chill out in this hotel.
Josie (as Minx): Well, of course we’re gonna get room service.
Kim: [sing-song] What is on the menu?
Rhi: Let’s see… there’s a goat cheese and mushroom risotto.
Kim (as Blaire): Ah, yes.
Josie (as Minx): Mm.
Rhi: I think there is a squid-ink pasta with squid and some other seafood in it.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps]
Josie (as Minx): Oh, I’ve had that, it’s really good.
Kim (as Blaire): That sounds really yummy.
Josie (as Minx): But you look like a demon after eating it.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): I look like a demon all the time!
Rhi: And maybe like a goat stew. A rich goat stew that actually has some vegetables in it. Some radiant energy veggies.
Minna: Ooh, fancy.
Kim: Very fancy.
Josie: Minx is gonna go for the risotto.
Kim (as Blaire): I want the squiddy bowl.
Rhi: What’s Myra gonna get?
Minna: The goat stew.
Rhi: Alright. And I think there is also a dessert option. I think there is goat’s milk ice cream and there’s also sweet potato cookies.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: Like, spiced sweet potato cookies.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna go for the ice cream.
Kim: Cookies please.
Rhi: So I think we fade out on the room with the three of you sprawled out on this big bed and we fade back in to, like, the little table in the middle of the seating area just covered in dishes and glasses, as the three of you are sprawled out post-meal.
Kim (as Blaire): I never want to eat anything again in my life. I’m so happy.
Rhi: Blaire’s mouth is in fact stained completely black.
Kim: Yup.
Josie (as Minx): We will see about that at tomorrow’s dinner.
Kim (as Blaire): Are we doing this again?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I imagine we may go to a restaurant if we are still here tomorrow evening.
Kim (as Blaire): Alright!
Rhi: I think when you all set out to look for Frost is gonna be the start of the score. Ooh! Good for you, I got a 6.
Kim (as Blaire): Woo!
Rhi: Where do you set up shop?
Josie: One thing Minx wants to do is under the guise of checking her own entry in the guest registry try and see if there’s any names she might recognise as potential targets.
Rhi: Okay. So let’s say that the three of you head down to the lobby to start scouting for information. Minx, you ask to see the guest registry. Myra and Blaire are, I think, hanging out by the fountain.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: With Kevin’s sibling.
Kim: Kevina.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: And you see out of the corner of your eye, coming out of the bar that’s attached to the hotel, you see a fairly familiar-looking woman carrying a tray in her hands, wearing a uniform of the hotel staff, heading for the stairs. And you’re like, ‘Is that… yeah, that’s her’. So, Frost is on her way to the stairs with a disguise and a tray.
Minna (as Myra): [whispers] Minx.
Josie (as Minx): Minx is gonna start a little bit, thank the people at the counter and go over to the other two.
Josie (as Minx): Yes dears?
Kim (as Blaire): Waitress, four o’clock.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Josie: Where is she heading to again? She’s heading up the stairs?
Rhi: Yeah, she’s heading to the stairs, leading up. Would they have elevators?
Kim: Huh.
Rhi: Let me do a quick Google. Yeah, no, 1853. Let me revise that. See, we’re an educational podcast.
Kim: Yes.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: So yeah, I think she’s heading for the elevators then.
Josie: She says on the episode with all the poop jokes.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: We contain multitudes.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. So Frost is disguised as a waiter, carrying a tray, heading for the elevators.
Kim (as Blaire): Pardon me, waitress? Hors d’oeuvres!
Rhi: She turns around and does a double take when she sees the three of you. She has that moment of surprise and then, like, puts her face back to neutral and is like:
Rhi (as Frost): I’m terribly sorry Miss, I am getting this upstairs to a customer, but I’m sure that they can help you in the bar.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, we’re on the fifth floor, we can follow you on the way.
Kim: And Blaire’s just gonna head for the elevator.
[laughter]
Minna: Myra follows.
Josie: [laughs] Wow. Okay, I was gonna try and be subtle.
Rhi: She gets into the elevator and positions herself in front of the call buttons. So the doors close, and as soon they’re closed she’s like:
Rhi (as Frost): What the hell are you doing here?
Josie (as Minx): You have made yourself rather hard to make contact with.
Rhi (as Frost): I didn’t wanna have contact with you all again. Like, I appreciate you getting me out of there, but what the hell are you doing here? I’m working.
Kim (as Blaire): So are we.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, it is a business matter. And it may be a bit of a mutual back-scratching situation.
Rhi (as Frost): Okay, what do you want?
Josie (as Minx): Simply put, we are trying to ensure justice is served properly. So, if you could recall in your memory a testimony for someone–
Kim (as Blaire): We’re trying to frame a Bluecoat who–
Rhi (as Frost): Oh, okay.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I was trying to make absolutely certain, but yes. Alright.
Rhi (as Frost): Okay. I mean, I like screwing over The Bluecoats, but wait. Testimony? You don’t want me to testify, do you? I’m not going back to Ironhook.
Kim (as Blaire): We know an Inspector who is trustworthy and is on our side.
Rhi (as Frost): [snorts] Right. Listen.
Josie (as Minx): And by trustworthy, I mean open to business.
Rhi (as Frost): Okay, look, I’m kind of in the middle of something right now.
Rhi: And she’s gonna, like, hit the sixth floor button behind her and the elevator shudders a little bit and starts to rise.
Rhi (as Frost): Look, I don’t have time right now to deal with whatever your little thing is. So if you all can just, I don’t know, wait in the hall while I take care of this.
Rhi: And she lifts the lid off of the tray and… well, you’re pretty sure you know what the knives are for.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: The corkscrew’s a little worrying.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: There’s some vials on there that Blaire, you’re pretty sure is acid.
Kim: Yup.
Rhi: And then there’s a few little doodads that none of you have really seen before and you’re not sure what they’d be used for, but they’re covered in pointy bits and would probably be painful.
Kim (as Blaire): Well then, what if we help you make the time. We don’t have the time, let’s speed things up for you.
Rhi (as Frost): No, no, no. this isn’t gonna be a fast thing here that I’m doing. I need to make an example of somebody.
Kim (as Blaire): Well then how can we assist?
Rhi (as Frost): Um…
Josie (as Minx): I imagine keeping people from discovering the example before it is properly prepared.
Rhi (as Frost): I mean, yeah, that would help, if you can keep security away. There’s gonna be some screaming.
Kim (as Blaire): We could look into that.
Rhi (as Frost): You know, I think there’s some security systems on this floor that maybe you could shut down if they start doing anything wonky, because I have a feeling this person’s gonna try and run as soon as I see ‘em. Oh, if they run, can you stop ‘em?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, we’re pretty good at stopping.
Rhi (as Frost): Okay, great.
Rhi: Ding! You reach the sixth floor. The doors slide open and she puts the lid back on tray and kinda straightens up and is like:
Rhi (as Frost): Alright, well, I guess you just wanna wait out here and keep an eye on things.
Minna (as Myra): Are you willing to make deal on it?
Rhi (as Frost): [frustrated] I gotta work here, you all wait out here and deal with things, I got a job to do!
Minna (as Myra): It will only take a moment.
Rhi (as Frost): What?
Minna: I think she holds her hand out and there’s like sort of a glowy rune forming on it.
Rhi: Um, you’re gonna need to make some sort of check to convince her to shake your spooky ghost hand.
Minna: Listen, she doesn’t trust her to keep her end of the bargain and she really wants to have payoff for this.
Kim: That’s fair. Give us some insurance.
Minna: Can it be a Consort? Or does it have to be a Sway?
Rhi: I think it’s probably Sway, because you are kinda trying to manipulate her here.
Minna: Okay. Yeah, I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: Okay. You’re in a controlled position at least.
Minna: That’s a 6.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna (as Myra): If we keep this operation of yours quiet, you’ll help us with that testimony. Your choice.
Rhi (as Frost): I think she’d been standing there with a hand raised to knock on this door, and lowers her hand and is just like:
Rhi (as Frost): Well, aren’t you conniving. Fine.
Rhi: And shakes your hand.
Minna: There’s the whole, like, flash and a rune gets marked on her hand.
Rhi (as Frost): Oh, cool. That’s subtle. Fine. All of you keep the hallway quiet and clear of security and if this person here tries to make a run for it, just shove ‘em back in the room. Kay?
Kim (as Blaire): Okey dokey.
Josie (as Minx): Alright.
Minna (as Myra): Will do.
Rhi (as Frost): Alright. Now move.
Rhi: And she shoos you off further down the hall and then knocks on the door.
## [00.51.42] Content warning: non-graphic discussion of/implication of torture and murder (happens off-screen). To skip, go to the next timestamp.
Rhi (as Frost): [clears throat] Room service!
Rhi: And then I think there’s a pause and the door cracks open, and she just like shoulders into the door and barrels in. And then there’s a lot of shouting and clattering and the door slams.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, she’s good at what she does.
Rhi: Some screaming and pleas for mercy happening.
Minna: Which Myra is looking very uneasy about.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Okay, possible to do in a flashback.
Rhi: Mm-hmm?
Josie: First of all, is there any other rooms on this floor, or is it just the penthouse?
Rhi: There’s the penthouse and then I think there is probably doors to the stairs on either end of the hall, and then there’s probably a maintenance closet or a linen closet type thing, so they don’t have to go down a floor to clean up in the penthouse, because that’s gonna be a big enough job already.
Josie: I have a flashback for Minx to have a disguise. What is the housekeeping garb around here like?
Rhi: Um…
Josie: Point is, I’m wondering if a maid outfit is period appropriate.
Kim: Oh my God.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: It is now. Yep.
Kim: We are uncontrollable.
Minna: I think it would be a maid outfit with a long skirt, maybe?
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: But I could definitely see that being period appropriate.
Josie: Oh, yeah. Like, this is an actual maid outfit, not the kind that probably was conjured in Kim’s head.
Kim: Thank you for putting me on blast.
Rhi: A maid’s outfit would work.
Josie: Okay. Would I take any stress from that?
Rhi: I think one stress to acquire it.
Kim: And another one for making me sound horny.
Rhi: No. That’s free. I feel like I should give her bonus points for that.
[laughter]
Josie: So, I think Minx is calmly gonna return to the room and emerge in a maid’s outfit and try and get into that linen closet.
Rhi: Okay. I think it is probably locked. And you probably do not have keys. You got the outfit, you didn’t get keys.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): Would anyone be willing to help me pick the lock on this?
Kim: I can help with that. I will roll a Tinker. Oh no. That’s a 1.
Rhi: Okay. So this was still controlled.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So I think you crouch down to start picking the lock and like, as you get the picks in there, there’s a blood-curdling scream from inside the penthouse. And it startles you and that was not quiet. People probably heard that. So if you keep trying to pick this lock, you’re gonna drop down into risky, or you can try something else.
Kim: I dunno, I think it’s worth the gamble if I push myself. What do you folks think?
Minna (as Myra): I think so.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Alright, let me try again. Okay, that’s better. That’s a 6.
Rhi: Alright. So yeah, this time you manage to get the lock open. So the linen closet is now open to you.
Josie: Okay. In there I’m going to take some linens and things, press them at the bottom of the door, so try and press them in to limit the sound that gets out.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Josie: And do they have one of those little housekeeping carts that I can load things onto?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Okay. What I’m gonna do is head down to the floor below us, right by the stairs, so I can see and maybe hear with my little cart and look like I’m preparing things. So I can keep watch.
Rhi: Okay, so you’re going down a floor to keep watch. Okay.
Josie: And then if I, like, see the elevator moving I can press the call button on the floor down here or something.
Rhi: There was that blood-curdling scream, Minx goes downstairs to keep an eye on things, on the elevator. Myra and Blaire are hanging out in this hallway. You can hear more struggling sounds coming from inside the room. And then the door crashes open and a man in his, we’ll say late 20s, dark hair, light skin, fairly typical Akorosian features, who is bleeding heavily from multiple stab wounds and has this horrible gash down the side of his face comes staggering out and sees Blaire and kind of lurches towards you and is like:
Rhi (as Man): [yells] You have to help me! You have to help me! She’s trying to kill me!
Kim (as Blaire): Wha… I… Myra? Stop him?
Minna: Oh no, how do I do this? We have partnered with somebody who is not great.
Rhi: Who is a really bad person, but you made a deal to keep this quiet.
Kim: We did make a deal.
Minna: I did make a deal.
Josie: Mm-hmm. You mystically locked yourself into it.
Rhi: What happens if you renege on your deal?
Minna: Let me look at Ghost Contract really quick.
Rhi: Level 3 harm, Cursed. That’s vague and enticing.
Minna: Yeah, but I’m not gonna do that because I made a fucking deal.
Rhi: I mean, your consciences might start–
Minna: So has he come up to… he went up to Blaire, has he seen me?
Rhi: Yeah, he rushed to Blaire.
Kim: However, I’m thinking I might want to engage him.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I want to check off my fine lightning hooks and roll a Skirmish. Just to see how that goes.
Rhi: Okay, yeah.
Kim: Devil’s Bargain?
Rhi: Okay. So this Devil’s Bargain comes to us from Prism Phoenix and the offer is, ‘They like you more than you’re comfortable with’. The ‘they’ in question here is Frost. Frost is going to–
Kim: Like Blaire?
Rhi: Not in a romantic sense.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: But in a, you know, you have this blood-thirsty assassin approving of what you do and, you know, is going to remember your assistance in this matter.
Kim: I kinda wanna accept that.
Josie: That is fucking perfect.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Do it.
Kim: I accept.
Rhi: Alright. Okay.
Josie: Character moment!
Kim: Okay. That’s a 5.
Rhi: You do it, but there’s a consequence. So this guy is rushing at you, and is screaming for help. And you whip out your lightning hooks and swing at him, but there’s a lot of flailing. And eventually you hit him with one of them and he falls against the wall. Your other one goes into the wall and punches through the drywall, and hits something in the wiring.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh oh.
Rhi: And I think a bell starts ringing.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim: What kind of bell? Is it the bell I’m thinking of?
Rhi: No, no, it’s not the death bell.
Kim: [relieved] Oh, okay.
Rhi: I think what it is, is it’s trying to get an order from the bar.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: So it’s alerting the staff downstairs that this person wants something brought to their room. So, there’s a service bell chiming and then as this guy hits the wall and is shaking with having been electrocuted, Frost steps out and is like:
Rhi (as Frost): Ooh, electrocution. Hadn’t thought of that one.
Rhi: And she comes over, grabs this guy by the wrist and starts dragging him back and is like:
Rhi (as Frost): Good thinking, kid!
Kim (as Blaire): I… it’s for getting to the Deathlands. It’s for emergencies only.
Rhi: She just drags him back into the room and kicks the door shut.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Josie: Your approval fills me with shame.
Rhi: Yeah, basically.
Kim: She panicked. Blaire panicked.
Josie: What of that did I hear?
Rhi: I think you heard some thumps and stuff upstairs. I don’t know that you heard the bell necessarily, because it’s going downstairs.
Josie: I think I am going to call the elevator to my floor.
Rhi: Okay. It’ll take a minute to get there. Myra, what are you doing in all of this?
Minna: So I think Myra just watched that shit go down with Blaire and the guy and Frost. Now there’s a bell ringing. So somebody going to come up the elevator shaft?
Rhi: Probably. That seems like the most efficient way. Like, it’s on the sixth floor. Nobody wants to walk up six flights of stairs.
Minna: Myra’s gonna wait there and I think her plan is to, like, if somebody comes up, pretend to be the lady-friend of the person up there, who wanted a drink.
Rhi: Okay. So I think when the elevator reaches your floor, Minx, the fifth floor, there’s a person in the hotel staff uniform standing there looking kinda bored. And when he sees you there he puts his arm on the door and is like:
Rhi (as Staff Member): Come on. You going up?
Josie: I’m gonna look back and forth and kind of shrug and shake my head.
Rhi (as Staff Member): Oh. Alright.
Rhi: He takes his hand off the door and… so you’re not getting on the elevator?
Josie: I’m not getting on the elevator.
Rhi: Okay. So ding! The doors open on the sixth floor. Myra, you’ve got a dude in hotel uniform stepping off the elevator.
Minna: I think she’s kind of like, giggling a little and fixing her hair and is like:
Minna (as Myra): I’m so sorry, we didn’t mean to press the button. It’s fine.
Rhi: Gimme a roll.
Minna: Okay, this is a Sway.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Risky, because there’s a grisly murder happening about six feet behind you, behind that door.
Minna: Yeah, I think I’m gonna push myself again. 6.
Rhi: God.
Minna: The dice are loving me tonight.
Josie: Nice.
Minna (as Myra): We would really rather not be disturbed, if you know what I mean.
Rhi (as Staff Member): Oh. Oh, sorry about, okay. Right. I’ll just go back downstairs.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you. I’m gonna go back there.
Rhi (as Staff Member): Okay.
Rhi: Steps back on the elevator and doors close.
Minna: I hate that I just potentially provided an excuse for screaming sounds.
Rhi: Yep. No, you definitely did.
Josie: Yeah. I mean, how is the time when we decide to assist a fairly evil murderer in an assassination, that is the score where we roll consistently well?
## [01.02.00] End of content warning.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s the thing. Right now, unless you all do something else, this is just gonna kind of… resolve.
Josie: Yeah, like, honestly.
Rhi: Yeah. So I think a really uncomfortable twenty minutes, which is more uncomfortable for Myra and Blaire because it’s gone fairly quiet in the room, and then the door opens and Frost comes out, peeling off gloves. She’s like:
Rhi (as Frost): Well, I dunno what you all did, but good work.
Rhi: Shuts the door very firmly behind her. Is like:
Rhi (as Frost): We should go.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, we should.
Rhi (as Frost): I need to throw these in something.
Rhi: And as she’s gesturing with the gloves, you can see, I’m picturing this as black slacks, white shirt, black vest getup for the hotel staff and there’s just a couple flecks of red on the collar.
Kim (as Blaire): All things considered, you work pretty clean.
Rhi (as Frost): Yeah, I’ve got experience. Seems like you may have a little bit of a knack for this too, huh?
Rhi: And slings an arm around your shoulders.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Rhi (as Frost): Come on, let’s take the stairs down. Where’d your friend go?
Josie: And I think that’s when Minx comes up to calmly replace the linen cart.
Kim (as Blaire): My thing is more taking apart dead things and not the actual killing.
Rhi (as Frost): Ah, but if you start killing yourself then you’ll know the quality of the dead things you’re getting.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm… I buy from good supp–
Rhi (as Frost): I could provide you with bodies! We could work out an arrangement.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t need human bodies right now.
Rhi (as Frost): I charge very reasonable rates.
Rhi: And I think she’s, like, walking Blaire to the stairs to head downstairs.
Kim: She is giving ‘help me’ eyes to both of you.
Josie: Yeah, Minx is gonna follow, concerned.
Rhi: The four of you head downstairs and she leads you down the stairs and back out the staff entrance into an alley, and then is like:
Rhi (as Frost): What do you…
Rhi: And holds up her hand and is pointing at the rune and is like:
Rhi (as Frost): What am I testifying about and to who?
Josie (as Minx): When you were released from Ironhook, you are to pin some of that on Norris Boyd.
Rhi (as Frost): Uh huh. And this is the Bluecoat?
Josie (as Minx) and Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Rhi (as Frost): Okay.
Josie (as Minx): Simply put, you were a witness. Make it condemning.
Rhi (as Frost): Okay, I can do that. And what’s gonna happen to this guy?
Kim (as Blaire): We’re hoping to put him behind bars.
Rhi (as Frost): Hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): Hope that the dirt on him is enough for The Bluecoats to actually, you know, take note of it. But the real big point we’re trying to drive home is that we’re trying to make it look like he was our point of contact that got us into Ironhook in the first place.
Rhi (as Frost): Oh, okay. Yeah, I can probably swing that. I mean, I guess I kinda… what happens if I don’t?
Rhi: Pointing at the rune again and looking at Myra.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, if you leave and disappear into the dark?
Rhi (as Frost): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): You’ll be cursed.
Rhi (as Frost): What’s that mean?
Minna (as Myra): Well, it could mean any number of things, I don’t have that much control over the execution. It’s been a long time since somebody broke that promise.
Rhi: Gimme a roll.
Minna: [laughs] I think it’s the coercion one.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s Command.
Minna: 4.
Rhi (as Frost): Alright, well I guess I don’t wanna particularly find out. I’ll make it over to your Inspector guy eventually. Well, pleasure working with you all, surprisingly enough. And,
Rhi: Points at Blaire,
Rhi (as Frost): You let me know about those bodies. I have very reasonable rates.
Kim (as Blaire): [squirms]
Rhi: Finger guns at you and strolls off into the night.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispers] I really don’t want her bodies.
Josie (as Minx): Nor do I. That was a fairly dramatic change in attitude for her. What happened?
Kim (as Blaire): I… look, the guy came at me, I panicked, I used my lightning hooks to zap him a little. And apparently that was enough to impress her.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that is a function of her own sadistic mind. Although I must admit, this whole arrangement was unsavory. But I suppose it was either that asshole who we did not know, or Rigney.
Kim (as Blaire): About to say the same thing. Anything to get this off of Rigney’s back. It’ll be worth it.
Minna (as Myra): That said, I don’t want to work with this person again in the future if we can avoid it.
Kim (as Blaire): Neither do I.
Josie (as Minx): Then we shall not.
Kim (as Blaire): Great, let’s go.
Rhi: Okay, so let’s go into downtime. And I think we are gonna start with Blaire and Myra.
Minna: Hi.
Rhi: Hi.
Kim: Sup.
Rhi: Where do the two of you arrange to meet with Severin, do you think?
Kim: I think it might be one of the cafés that Myra meets Jeren at occasionally.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Myra just off-hand suggests it?
Kim: Yep.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: It’s like, ‘This is a good private place…’
Minna: It’s a good place to meet.
Rhi: Yeah. So, I think the two of you get there pretty early, being the paranoid criminal types that you are.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: So yeah, you’ve got a nice corner table, clear view of all windows and exits. And what are you two up to here?
Minna: Myra’s reading the paper. I think she’s picked it up on the way, and she hasn’t looked at the headline yet. She opens it and kind of still face, reading it.
Rhi: The headline is something to the effect of, ‘Grisly Murder in Karstas Arms Hotel’. And there’s an artist’s rendering of the front of the hotel as the picture in the article, but the article starts describing the crime scene in pretty lurid detail.
Minna: She gets a paragraph into it and folds up the paper and pushes it aside.
Kim (as Blaire): What, is it about us?
Minna (as Myra): It’s about the hotel.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh.
Minna (as Myra): That man came running to us for help and we sent him right back in.
Kim (as Blaire): There was nothing we could do. If we helped him then, you know, Frost would have turned on us.
Minna (as Myra): I know. But I don’t think we should be making deals with people like that, or that’s what’s at stake.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, no, of course not. This was an exception to our rule. We’re not gonna go seeking out someone like this again unless we really, really have to. And frankly, I don’t see that being the case.
Minna (as Myra): I’m not used to… it’s fine.
Kim (as Blaire): What? No, you’re clearly not fine, Myra. What’s going on?
Minna (as Myra): Violence isn’t usually my answer, and senseless violence like this… I mean, it’s just to prove a point. I guess I haven’t had to be as thoroughly involved with something that felt like this before.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s fair.
Minna (as Myra): The kind of violence I’m used to is a little bit more distanced.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm.
Minna (as Myra): Self-defense, or killing people that we think are horrible, and I’m not even the person who does that. It’s harder.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, I hear ya. That was definitely the closest I’ve ever been to a guy that was, you know, bleeding out of every orifice he could be bleeding out of.
Minna (as Myra): [grimace] That’s an apt description.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t like that feeling and I don’t want it again.
Kim (as Blaire): No. No, I don’t either. The whole thing with the lightning hooks, that was a reflex on my part. I didn’t know how else to really shut him up, you know?
Minna (as Myra): I understand. It was a difficult situation and we put ourselves in it, but we can learn better for next time.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I’m not gonna be seeking her out or anything, and if she tries finding me I’m definitely gonna distance myself.
Minna (as Myra): That sounds good.
Rhi: I think the bell over the door chimes and Severin walks in. He kinda glances around and spots the two of you and walks over to the table.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, good Inspector, hello.
Rhi (as Severin): Please, don’t use my title. I’m trying to be a little incognito right now.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Okay, sorry. So, Gilbert.
Rhi (as Severin): I spoke with your contact.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Severin): Who gave a very vivid statement of Lieutenant Boyd’s involvement in the jailbreak. I can work with what she gave me. And you all got the papers planted at his place, I assume?
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Severin): I wouldn’t imagine that would be too difficult. Well, I think between the papers and a witness statement, that should be a decent start. It’ll probably take me a little bit to get a conviction, but I’m pretty confident I can pull it off.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you. It means a lot, because this is all for a friend.
Rhi (as Severin): I’ll keep you all-, well I suppose you can just keep an eye on the papers.
Rhi: And he gestures at the paper that Myra shoved aside.
Rhi (as Severin): I’m sure you’ll see soon enough some news about it.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you.
Rhi (as Severin): I officially start back at work in two days.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s great.
Rhi (as Severin): Yeah. Yeah, it’ll be good to be back. And this’ll be, I think, a good way to start things off. Take down a Lieutenant.
Kim (as Blaire): Good luck.
Rhi (as Severin): Thanks, and I guess good luck to you too. I don’t wanna know what you’re going to be up to, but–
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] We’d rather not tell you.
Rhi (as Severin): Yeah. I don’t know if we’re exactly on the same side, but I think we’ve at least got similar goals.
Minna (as Myra): I think I can agree to that.
Rhi: So I think we kind of pan out from this café and zoom across the city, over to Silkshore and The Red Lamp.
Josie: I think Minx is waiting in the lobby of The Red Lamp. She’s femme-ing it up a bit more since she was a little bit butch and military on the score. She too is just putting down the paper and kind of digesting things a little bit clearly.
Rhi: The lobby, I think we’ve talked about this a little bit, it’s a nice space. There’s a fireplace and a bar and some very nice plush furniture. So I think Minx is sitting kind of off by herself in an armchair.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: And you hear a voice behind you say:
Rhi (as Voice): It’s Minx, isn’t it?
Josie: I turn to look before answering.
Rhi: And you see a woman who you’ve only seen a couple times before. Light skin, dark hair cut short in a very fashionable bob, stunning beautiful gown in the latest fashions. This is Madame Tesslyn, the owner of The Red Lamp and Nyryx’s employer.
Josie: Oh. Yes, Minx will stand up and give a little bow.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, Miss Tesslyn.
Rhi (as Madame Tesslyn): Aren’t you gallant? Please, have a seat. You’re Nyryx’s partner, aren’t you?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, yes. Is there something the matter?
Rhi (as Madame Tesslyn): Oh no, not at all. On the contrary, quite frankly. She seems to be much happier these days and it’s really very impressive of you that you would be so understanding. Most people wouldn’t, with her situation.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I’m hardly one to judge for profession. You do good work here.
Rhi (as Madame Tesslyn): Oh no, not her job, dear. The spirit.
Minna: [gasps]
Josie: Minx is kind of working her mouth a little bit, like, trying to say something. Nothing comes out. She works a little bit more before finally squeaking out:
Josie (as Minx): What?
Rhi (as Madame Tesslyn): Oh. You didn’t know? Oh.
Josie (as Minx): I don’t… I… I’m sorry madam, I have no idea what you’re speaking about.
Rhi (as Madame Tesslyn): Oh, I’m terribly sorry.
Rhi: She’s lying, she’s not sorry.
Rhi (as Madame Tesslyn): I’m sorry, I assumed that you knew. I shouldn’t say any more. You should probably talk to Nyryx about it.
Rhi: And she starts to stand up to leave.
Josie: Minx is kind of staring off and thinking, and doesn’t say goodbye and doesn’t even really notice her leave. She’s just gonna drum her fingers on the top of her cane a little bit, waiting for Nyryx to show up.
Rhi: Yeah. So I think you wait for probably another ten, fifteen minutes, I think you got here pretty close to the end of her shift. And Nyryx comes down the stairs, she’s obviously just put on her coat. She’s pulling her hair out from under the collar and waves to the receptionist as she passes and then gives a big, bright smile when she sees you and comes bounding over.
Josie: I think as she’s coming over Minx rushes to her and pulls her into a hug, kind of desperately.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [surprised laugh] Hi!
Josie (as Minx): Dear are you–, hold on, we need to get outside for the moment.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Um, alright. Is everything okay?
Josie: Minx is kinda gonna hurry them outside.
Josie (as Minx): You are safe here, right? They’re not bringing in specters?
Rhi (as Nyryx): No.
Josie (as Minx): Your boss said something about a spirit.
Rhi (as Nyryx): What?
Josie (as Minx): She said something about understanding and a spirit. I don’t know if that’s a weird clientele that is catered to here, I do not know all the intricacies of your job, but if there are loose spirits, that’s not something that can be–
Rhi (as Nyryx): [stammering] I don’t know what she’s talking about.
Rhi: She’s lying.
Minna: [excited murmur]
Josie (as Minx): Nyryx, it’s okay. You can tell me.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t think there’s anything to tell. I really don’t know what she’s talking about.
Rhi: Lying.
Josie: Minx is going to look down and just stare in her eyes, dead on. She’s not mad, but she’s trying to make it clear that she’s deathly serious right now and didn’t believe that.
Rhi: She rubs her forehead.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t really want to have this conversation on the street.
Josie (as Minx): You know, that is fair. Your place is closest, I think perhaps behind closed doors might be the best place to discuss something like this.
Rhi: Yeah. So I think the two of you make this walk fairly quickly and in absolute silence.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: She is not talking.
Josie: And Minx is kind of like, paranoidly looking back a few times.
Rhi: So she unlocks the door and lets you in and closes the door and is kind of pacing a little bit and wringing her hands. Looks very nervous. And is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t… I don’t even know how to explain this to you.
Josie (as Minx): Is it something to do with work?
Rhi (as Nyryx): No.
Josie (as Minx): Alright. Are you safe? That is what concerns me.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yeah, I’m perfectly safe.
Josie (as Minx): Are you certain? Because, I mean, I’ve spent some time around spirits. I work with Blaire, after all. Do you think it’s something she can help you with?
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t need help. I’m trying to help someone else.
Josie (as Minx): What do you mean?
Rhi (as Nyryx): [sighs]
Josie (as Minx): Nyry.
Rhi: She paces away from you and has her back to you as she starts talking. And she says:
Rhi (as Nyryx): A while ago this spirit showed up here in my apartment. I think she was lost. She was lost. She was definitely lost. She was so young and she died in this trash heap in the places that we used to live. And she was lost and she was scared, and it could have been me that ended up like that. It could have been you. And I just, I had to help her somehow.
Rhi: And I think as she turns around you can tell that there’s somebody else looking out through Nyryx’s eyes.
Josie: Minx is gonna straighten up. Her eyes go wide a little bit. She’s not gonna, like, scream or panic or run for the door, but she is gonna take half a step back before maybe thinking better of it. But she’ll keep looking right at Nyryx.
Rhi: This other person says with Nyryx’s voice:
Rhi (as Spirit via Nyryx): I made her keep it a secret. I was afraid of what would happen if you found out.
Rhi: And she’s lying.
Josie: Now Minx is starting to look angry.
Josie (as Minx): I would rather hear of her actions from her. Thank you.
Rhi: Nyryx blinks and it’s her again.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I’m sorry–
Josie (as Minx): You’re possessed?
Rhi: She just nods.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I didn’t know how to tell you.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, again, do you need help removing her?
Rhi (as Nyryx): No. I let her in.
Josie (as Minx): Why? How long?
Rhi (as Nyryx): A while.
Josie (as Minx): I see. I take it it’s not viewed as a temporary arrangement.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t think it’s forever.
Josie (as Minx): You don’t think?
Rhi: She shrugs.
Rhi (as Nyryx): It’s working for now. And if she wants to move on or if I want her to move on, then we’ll figure out what happens. But she had the kinda life we did so much to escape. And if I can help this person who could have… she reminds me so much of you.
Josie (as Minx): Nyry, I understand that. Not going to lie, I’m afraid. I’m still afraid of ghosts, as I’ve always been. I don’t like thinking about what comes after. But, working with The Magpies I’ve seen a few situations up to and including a willing possession. You’re so kind and caring and generous and this makes perfect sense. I mean, these are all further reasons I love you, after all. Why didn’t you tell me sooner?
Rhi: She looks like she’s just barely holding back tears and just shakes her head.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I was scared. I didn’t know how. I’m sorry.
Josie: I think Minx has started silently crying at some point, and she’ll take the foot that took a step back and place it forward and move slowly towards her and gauge her reaction to that.
Rhi: She’s just kind of watching you and blinking a lot to try to keep her own tears from falling.
Josie (as Minx): I think Minx is going to go right up to her and very clearly reach for her, hesitate, pull back, and give a gentle hug and soft kiss to the forehead.
Josie (as Minx): I think… I don’t know what I think. Has the other one been privy to everything?
Rhi (as Nyryx): No, I can send her away. She’s still tied to me, but she’s not present or aware of what’s going on when I’m with you or any of my clients. It’s not like that.
Josie: Minx sort of nods in reassurance to herself, if anything.
Josie (as Minx): Good. Good, I shudder to think of the other possibility. So, were you ever planning on telling me?
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t know. There just didn’t seem to be a good way to bring it up.
Josie (as Minx): I am uncertain how to process this myself, frankly. What’s her name?
Rhi (as Nyryx): She doesn’t remember.
Josie (as Minx): What should I call her?
Rhi: Nyryx kind of frowns and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): She’s mostly been using my name.
Josie (as Minx): That is confusing.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yes, I suppose it is. I hadn’t really thought about this. I guess I’ll have to now.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose. Can I speak to her for a moment?
Rhi: She nods and in the span of a blink that look in her eyes changes. And the spirit looking out at you looks pretty nervous, just sort of waiting.
Josie (as Minx): So this is truthful, what you have told her?
Rhi (as Spirit via Nyryx): Yes. It is.
Josie (as Minx): How long do you intend to stay?
Rhi (as Spirit via Nyryx): I’m not sure. She’s very kind and her life is so much nicer than mine was. But I won’t stay longer than she wants me.
Josie: Minx still looks suspicious, but nods. She can tell when someone’s lying to her.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): And you are not… your presence doesn’t drain her?
Rhi: She shakes her head.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose I better ask you what I should call you.
Rhi (as Spirit via Nyryx): Um…
Rhi: God, I think she’s gonna do, like, a line of sight name where she’s just gonna look for something in the apartment and pick a random object.
Josie: [laughs] Excellent.
Rhi: You can see her eyes kind of dart past you and look around and she’s like:
Rhi (as Spirit via Nyryx): Um… Kettle? No, that’s not really a name, is it? Um…
Rhi: And I think her eyes land on a painting that Nyryx has.
Rhi (as Spirit via Nyryx): Um… ah… Lilac? Is that a name?
Josie (as Minx): Lilac. I don’t know if it’s a name, but it’s pretty.
Rhi (as Lilac via Nyryx): Let’s go with that.
Josie (as Minx): How old are you, Lilac?
Rhi (as Lilac via Nyryx): I’m not sure exactly. More than eighteen, less than twenty or so, I guess? Around there?
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Lilac via Nyryx): I’m not sure exactly how old I was.
Josie (as Minx): Goodness. I’m sorry you had to go so long with a similar upbringing to us.
Rhi (as Lilac via Nyryx): It’s a little better now, actually. [nervous laugh]
Josie (as Minx): I’m glad of that, at least. Well it was a pleasure meeting you, Lilac.
Rhi (as Lilac via Nyryx): It’s good to officially meet you, too. Nyryx, she loves you very much. You know that, right?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I love her too.
Rhi (as Lilac via Nyryx): Good.
Rhi: And Nyryx blinks and it’s her again.
Josie: Now that Lilac is gone I think Minx is gonna rush in for a deeper hug.
Rhi: Aww. Yeah, she hugs you back and it’s a very clinging, desperate hug.
Josie: Mm-hmm. And Minx was holding herself together for that for a little bit, so she’s crying too.
Rhi: Aww. Yeah, I think Nyryx had pretty much been holding back tears the whole conversation, now is also crying into your shoulder.
Josie (as Minx): Nyry, it will take some time for me, but I don’t wanna leave.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Okay, I understand. However much time you need.
Josie (as Minx): I love you, and I wanna be here.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I love you too.
Rhi: So I think we fade out on that and fade back in on a familiar Bluecoat precinct station in Charterhall. We see Jeren walking down the steps, his satchel over his shoulder, looking kind of tired.
Minna: [worried gasp]
Rhi: He waves goodbye to the officers posted outside and they wave back and he starts walking through Charterhall. It seems like it’s probably pretty late. There’s not a lot of people out on the street. And he turns a corner down a narrow side street and we see in the shadows cast by the street lamp nearby someone move up behind him. And then Jeren gets hit in the back of the head with something and he staggers forward with a cry of pain.
Minna: [moans]
Rhi: And then gets hit again and we see him fall face first, unconscious, onto the street.
Minna: [upset] Uh huh.
Rhi: End of episode.

Season 2, Episode 21: The Open Secrets Score
Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall, and welcome to the Season 2 finale. The events in this episode have been a long time coming, and I hope that you all enjoy the secrets revealed.
I do want to give everyone a heads up on what’s next. Two weeks from today we’ll be posting our Season 2 Q&A wrap-up episode. After that, there will be a one month hiatus before Season 3 starts. I’ve gotten pretty far behind on editing the podcast, and I need some time off from posting new Magpies episodes so I can catch up, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be anything new. I’ve got plans for some bonus episodes that will go up during that break. I’m still working out the details on what and when those episodes will be, so stay tuned. I should have all the juicy details for you by next episode.
I also want to say thank you, again, so very much for all your support over these last two seasons. Listening to the show, tweeting at us, sending emails, backing us on Patreon, writing poems, creating fan art, composing music, designing pins… the love and support the show has gotten is beyond anything I could have expected when it began, and we still have a lot of story to tell. So, thank you, and I hope you’ll stick with The magpies as they continue on their adventures and quests for justice in Duskwall.
Other announcements: Next month is International Podcast Month. There will be lots of awesome episodes to hear. I am in a one-shot of Good Society, and I hosted a discussion about accessibility in tabletop RPGs with two really brilliant, insightful folks, and friends of the show, Waffles and Madge, will also be in some episodes. Keep an eye on the Magpies Twitter. I’ll be sharing links there as the episodes are posted.
In addition, I will be at AcadeCon in Dayton, Ohio again this November. I will be running a game of Blades in the Dark. Last year the game sold out very quickly, but even if you don’t make it into the game I will be wandering around with Magpies bookmarks and I’m always happy to meet fans in person.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s Featured Charity:
The Trans Language Primer is a resource that compiles information and resources around the language used by and about LGBTQ+ communities. It’s a historical record and a living document continually updated so that people within the community can dig deeper into identities and labels, and people without – especially medical professionals, social service workers, and those in the media – can learn the accepted terminology to address and refer to people in these communities. You can support their future work, which includes plans for translations into other languages, by backing their Patreon, and if you would prefer a one-time donation you can visit Editor and Chief Greyson’s Ko-Fi. Links will be in the show notes.
For our American listeners, please continue to call your representatives. You can visit 5calls.org for scripts on pressing issues, and check out organizations like Never Again Action for information on protests happening local to you. The 2020 campaign juggernaut is in full swing, but it doesn’t matter who the opposition candidate ends up being if we don’t have election security measures in place and expanded voting rights. Advocate for these issues with your elected officials and start the conversations about getting out to vote now. We need as many people as possible to show up to every election.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:04:10]
Rhi: We’re opening up a few days after your last score where you made questionable deals with extremely questionable people in order to send a Bluecoat to prison, to get the Bluecoats off of Rigney’s back. Inspector Severin is still kind of working on that case, but from what you have gotten from him over the, you know, you’ve gotten a couple notes from him, it seems like that’s moving along. But for today, you all are sort of taking a break from the crime and plots and schemes and drama and taking a day to run some errands. You have split up to go cover different things. Minx and Blaire have gone off to we’ll say get groceries.
Josie: [musically] Grocery shopping~
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Hold on. I think I need to establish what Minx is putting in the baskets and what Blaire is putting in the baskets.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yes. Please. We’re gonna do a quick cut to the grocery shopping. You’re at the market. What are you two grabbing?
Josie: Minx continually needs to scale back her taste a little bit. She always goes for the finest version of whatever there is and then is like, sigh… and then goes for the not-as-expensive version. It’s not like hers is necessarily healthier, but it’s all the finest.
Rhi: Yeah. What does Blaire grab?
Kim: Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of tea.
[laughter]
Rhi: There’s just a whole cupboard in The Nest that is just full of tea. So, you two are having a good grocery shopping adventure. Myra had split off from the two of you, partly because she needs to go clothes shopping and Minx has very different taste in clothes, [laughs] and Myra just wants to get that done quickly and efficiently. But also, she split off because she has arranged to meet up with Jeren for lunch. So, we start with Myra heading over to the little Nightmarket café where she and Jeren usually meet up, and you walk into the café, and Jeren is not there. However, seated at your usual table is a very familiar figure.
Minna: So, her back is to the door, but I recognize the way her shoulders are set, the outline of her, because I lived with her for several years.
Rhi: Yes. You walk over and Ojal looks up at you and says:
Rhi (as Ojal): I’m afraid he’s not gonna be making your meeting. Have a seat.
Minna: Myra walks over very stiffly and sits down. She’s looking over at Ojal, taking in her expression, and just keeping her cool outwardly.
Minna (as Myra): Perhaps you could tell me what caused this delay.
Rhi (as Ojal): Well…
Rhi: She reaches down next to her and picks up a brown paper bag and sets it on the table between the two of you.
Rhi (as Ojal): He, uh, is a bit indisposed.
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: And if you open up the bag…
Minna: She does.
Rhi: Inside is the torn off sleeve of a Bluecoat uniform that is pretty bloodied, and it’s not fresh blood, it’s had a chance to dry and crust on there.
Minna (as Myra): How long?
Rhi (as Ojal): Long enough. Now, I’m sure you can guess where this is going. If you want him to stay as intact as he currently is, well, Salia would like to see you. You come to the Barrowcleft safe house and he won’t be harmed any further.
Minna (as Myra): I see, and when does she expect me to attend to her?
Rhi (as Ojal): The sooner the better. I mean. If you take too long we might think that you’re leaving us again.
Minna (as Myra): I have some affairs to set in order.
Rhi (as Ojal): Take as long as you think he can stand, Myra. I’ll be seeing you.
Rhi: She pushes back from the table and walks out.
Minna: [smiling, into hands] So, what do we cut to?
Rhi: I think we cut back to The Nest with Hex sleeping in an armchair, Kevin near the fire, otherwise empty. Myra lets herself in, and… What are you gonna do?
Minna: [sighs] I think the first thing she does is she sits down with paper and pen, and you just see from a distance that she’s writing for a little while. She’s not writing a lot, but it’s taking her a while. Eventually she folds the note and weighs it down with, I guess a salt shaker at the kitchen table. We probably have a salt shaker. Oh boy. What does she even…? I think she goes into her bedroom and she just kinda turns a slow circle, like what do I even take with me for this? Then you just see her start to go through her stuff, and I think it fades out from there.
Rhi: Yeah. So, we fade back in on The Nest again. Hex has not moved, being a cat, he’s sleeping very hard. There’s footsteps on the stairs, and the door swings open, and Minx and Blaire come inside arms full of bags of groceries.
Josie (as Minx): Although I must admit I’m rather excited to try some Tycherosi tea. I don’t think I’ve ever done—What’s this now?
Kim (as Blaire): What’s what?
Josie: Minx has noticed the note and is gonna pick it up and read it.
Minna (as Myra): “Blaire and Minx, I have to go to a dangerous meeting and I don’t know if I’ll be back. I know I made a promise, but there is a longer standing promise at stake, and if I don’t go then I’ll have broken it. Please do not follow me. I know you’re going to try, but it can only get us all hurt. Myra”
Kim (as Blaire): [shrieks] What the fuck?!
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): My thoughts exactly, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): What the fuck does she think she’s doing?
Josie (as Minx): I don’t know. I can only assume that this involves Salia in some capacity.
Kim (as Blaire): [flails, stammers] Where the fuck did she go?!
Minna: [giggle-sobs]
Josie (as Minx): I must admit I haven’t the faintest idea where to begin looking.
Kim (as Blaire): [groans loudly]
Josie (as Minx): But we’re ignoring her warning, right? We’re going?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes! Of course.
Josie (as Minx): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): We just gotta find out where the FUCK she went first.
Rhi: Blaire.
Kim: Mm-hmm?
Rhi: Myra had mentioned this morning when she was, you know, when you were all heading out for your various errands she’d mentioned that she was meeting a friend for lunch and then doing some shopping of her own. When you and Myra met with Inspector Severin a few days ago, the place that you went to was this café in Nightmarket that Myra mentioned she goes there to grab lunch with people sometimes. So, you’re thinking maybe she was at that café?
Kim (as Blaire): She’s probably went to Panera.
Rhi: [cackles] God damn it, Kim!
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: [flatly] What? … [chuckles]
Josie (as Minx): I suppose that is where we must first check, then. I think we will have to talk there and then possibly visit Rigney?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): We never did get all of his details.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, we gotta get him up to speed with what’s going on.
Josie: Minx is gonna make sure that she has several weapons hidden on her, in a very quick fashion, and then set out… for Panera.
Rhi: [sighs]
Kim: Panera’s in Duskwall now. This is how the setting works. You just say things and then they come into existence.
Josie: Yep. RPGs!
Rhi: I… I hate you all. [laughter] Anyway. So, we cut over to the café.
Kim: Panera.
Rhi: The two of you head inside. I think it’s a little bit after the lunchtime rush, so there’s only a few people in here. No sign of Myra.
Josie: Minx will straight up ask the people behind the counter if they had seen someone matching Myra’s description come in.
Rhi: Go ahead and give me- This will basically just be a Gather Info roll.
Josie: Okay. I’m gonna go with Consort, because I’m not attempting any sort of deception here.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Four.
Rhi: Okay. A 4, standard amount of information, so yeah. You ask the people working at the counter, give them Myra’s description, and one of them is like:
Rhi (as Worker): Oh yeah, um… I saw her in here earlier. Met with some other woman. Uh, where were they…? It was a pretty short conversation. I think they mentioned Barrowcleft?
Josie (as Minx): I see. Thank you. I’m sorry, I’m just worried for her. She hasn’t come home.
Rhi (as Worker): Oh. Sorry, I don’t know. They, uh, the one woman left first and then your friend left a little bit after. It looked like, I don’t know, gave her something in a bag, maybe a present or something. Didn’t look very happy about it. Maybe a bad present.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I see. Thank you.
Josie: Minx is gonna kind of, trying to keep a normal pace but sort of, kind of breaking into a light jog a little bit, out of the restaurant. She’s gonna wanna go and grill Rigney for what he would know.
Rhi: Okay. All right.
Josie: Does Blaire wanna come too?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Like I said, it’s early afternoon, so not super crowded at this point. I assume the two of you burst in very dramatically.
Josie: Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Rigney~!
Josie (as Minx): Rigney, we need to speak. Back room.
Rhi (as Rigney): Uh, okay? What did we need to speak about?
Kim (as Blaire): [sharp inhale, sobbing] Myra’s gone.
Rhi (as Rigney): Shit. Um…
Kim (as Blaire): [stammers] Not dead gone, sorry. She disappeared.
Rhi (as Rigney): [sighs in relief] Okay.
Josie (as Minx): And we need to know any more details, no matter how insignificant, your ordeal with Salia’s associates. We need to be able to find her. Supposedly there’s something about Barrowcleft?
Rhi: I think he kinda glances around the bar, and then gestures for the two of you to follow him, and he’s gonna let you basically into the back employee area, basically back into the employee break room.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: And there’s like, you know, one of his staff is sitting there having a sandwich, and Rigney’s just like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Go cover the bar. I’ll let you leave early tonight.
Rhi: And he’s just like:
Rhi (as Employee): … Okay!
[laughter]
Rhi: Wraps up his sandwich and goes up front. So yeah, you’re alone in this back little room now, and give me another roll to see what Rigney can tell you.
Josie: Minx is still not quite over Rigney’s thing, but she’s very clearly putting that aside for this.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Five.
Rhi: Okay. So Rigney sits down in one of the chairs and drags his hands down his face.
Rhi (as Rigney): [exhales] Okay. Um… They always came to me, so I don’t know of any- I never saw any of her operation.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Rigney): Sometimes she had a few people with her, kinda rotating through, looked around you and Myra’s age. I never really- They didn’t talk much, just kind of stood there and watched the door while… [sighs] You said Barrowcleft?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. And were any names given?
Rhi (as Rigney): Let’s see. There were two women, Ojal and Clave, and then there was a man she called Wester.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi: Minna, refresh my memory. The score where Wester showed up, Blaire saw him, but Myra did not explain him, right?
Minna: Blaire saw him…
Kim: That sounds correct.
Minna: Yes, I think so.
Rhi (as Rigney): Clave—
Rhi: Well, he gives descriptions of each of them. Minna, would you like to describe them? [laughs]
Minna: [laughs] Clave is an icy blonde, blue eyes, generally… not frail looking, but probably the most frail looking of the lot of them. Ojal is a wiry woman. She has dark skin, a shaved head, generally always looks ready to spring into action. Wester is—God, how do I describe Wester? How did we describe Wester before?
Rhi: Just got the most punchable face.
Minna: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm. [laughs]
Rhi: That’s really all you need to know about Wester.
Minna: The main description is shitty white boy.
[laughter]
Rhi: So yeah, you recognize two of those three people as kind of like… they’ve been skulking around the edges of your operations for a little while now. I don’t know that he’s gonna have a ton of info about the location, though.
Josie: That makes sense.
Rhi (as Rigney): If there’s anything that I can do, um…
Josie (as Minx): Just stay safe, Rigney.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, stay safe.
Josie: She’ll put her hand on his shoulder for just a very, very brief moment and then walk out.
Kim: I’m gonna hug him~
Josie: Aw.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] He hugs her back.
Rhi (as Rigney): You two be safe. Bring her back home, all right?
Kim (as Blaire): We will.
Rhi: The two of you walk out and it just kinda stays on Rigney for a second, sitting at the table, looking very worried. All right, so…
Josie: I intend to go to the Gondoliers.
Rhi: Ahh.
Kim: Ah, of course.
Josie: And see if they have worked with or seen – especially while working in Barrowcleft – people of this description.
Rhi: Excellent.
Kim: Smart.
Rhi: Very smart.
Josie: I will even name-drop Salia, see if she’s got a reputation amongst them.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Go ahead and make a roll.
Kim: Oof.
Josie: [seethes] That sucks, that’s a 3.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay. So, um, they haven’t seen Salia. They have seen a few of the apprentices. They’ve given them rides before. They can’t really narrow it down too much other than in Barrowcleft. It doesn’t seem like there is even a particular dock that any of them use. Actually, it’s not even like—you know, asking around the Gondoliers can be like “oh yeah, we’ve picked them up in Crow’s Foot and Silkshore and Charterhall and Barrowcleft…” Salia’s operation, as you’re talking to them and trying to track the movements of these three people, it seems like she’s pretty spread out throughout the city.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Which is kind of good to know what you’re dealing with here, you’re dealing with somebody who has a pretty extensive operation, but they aren’t really able to give you any super specific details as to where in Barrowcleft they might be.
Josie: In that case, what I’m kind of imagining as this scene I guess goes on is, I don’t know if we want to do rolls for all of this, Minx and/or Blaire hit up a lot of the people they’ve encountered so far looking for information, just getting more and more desperate, I guess.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Like, I talk to the people we know in Charhollow, and gang granny, and—
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Rose.
Josie: Harker, and our various other contacts and the like.
Rhi: Yeah, we get a montage of you two just going around asking people. A lot of them haven’t seen any of these people at all.
Josie: Right. Point is, we’re getting down to our last couple of options.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that a few hours have passed since you found Myra’s letter, which you also don’t know how long it’s been since she left that letter.
Kim: Right.
Josie: Mm-hmm, although it couldn’t have been more than a couple hours, because we saw her that morning.
Rhi: Yes, but even so, most of the people you talk to just- they don’t know, the haven’t seen these people at all. It’s a big city.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, the two of you kind of circle back to The Nest after spending a few hours.
Josie (as Minx): Well Blaire, I’ve only got one more person who may be worthwhile to ask.
Kim (as Blaire): Lord Scurlock?
Josie (as Minx): Not what I had on my mind, but I was about to ask you if you had any ideas. I was thinking Bazso, as much as…
Kim (as Blaire): No, we can’t go to Bazso, not after, you know, last time.
Rhi: [strained] Yeah… Yeah, then Blaire’s gonna have to rescue two people. [laughs]
Josie: Oh right. Oh yeah, he did see us down there, didn’t he?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yep, yeah.
Josie: Ah, never mind.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s going from a frenemy to a straight up rival. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, is scrying a thing? Is that…?
Kim (as Blaire): It is, but…
Josie (as Minx): When I was associating with my more occult-inclined friends there was much talk of seeing things in a mirror. Is there anything similar to that we can do?
Kim (as Blaire): [nervous noises] Here’s the thing… The only way I kinda know how to do anything like that is with eyeball friend, and last time I did that I was out of it for like 24 hours, and I can’t let you go after Myra alone.
Josie (as Minx): I remember… [deep breath] I mean, do you think Scurlock would be able to provide us with anything?
Kim (as Blaire): Do it with me!
Josie (as Minx): Yes, of course.
Kim (as Blaire): No, scry with me. I bet if there’s two of us that the mental link between the mortals and the eyeball friend, it’ll be split up a bit more.
Josie: Minx will let out one of those cartoony gulps.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Oh…
Kim (as Blaire): I’m willing to bet that’s how it works.
Josie (as Minx): It’s for Myra? It’s for Myra. We have seen weirder things than an eyeball friend, I suppose. Let’s do it, before I change my mind, please.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you want anything before we go in? Do you want—Oh, you probably shouldn’t have any liquid courage, it would probably make the connection a bit muddy. Do you want me to give you anything to calm you down? Any tea, or…?
Josie (as Minx): I will set a pot of tea for afterwards.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Okay! Okay, if you’re sure… Um. We probably shouldn’t do this in my room. I’ll be right back.
Kim: Blaire goes to her room, retrieves eyeball friend, and brings the chest into the main living area.
Rhi: I haven’t- I like your thought, but I had never considered two people trying to use the Eye of Kotar simultaneously.
Josie: Power of friendship!
Rhi: Yeah! It’s a very cool idea.
Kim: It came to me, in a fit of inspiration.
Rhi: Yeah. I think… So, this is technically a Gather Info roll, but it does involve taking stress, so I will let you do a group action.
Kim: Thank you.
Josie: Okay. What sort of action is it?
Rhi: It’s gonna be Attune.
Kim: Uh-huh.
Josie: Okay, I have 0 dots in that.
Rhi: [chuckles]
Kim: That’s okay. I have 2.
Josie: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Kim: Already?
Rhi: Ohh…
Josie: I mean, I was gonna go for push myself, but I feel like this is an interesting spot for one.
Rhi: Yes, very interesting. Okay, so here is what I’m gonna offer. You are gonna end up taking the bulk of the stress, and the reason you take additional stress is because you’re gonna see something extra.
Josie: I can’t turn that down.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Like, I can’t. [laughs]
Rhi: Excellent! You’ll make an Attune roll. It’s basically a Gather Info roll, so there’s not gonna be any consequences, but you are going to take stress just because of the nature of this item.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So, go ahead and give me your rolls.
Kim: I know how this looks. You and I are holding one hand and in our free hands we are touching eyeball friend.
Rhi: [laughs into hands]
Josie: Yes.
Kim: So we’ve made a circle.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Go ahead and roll.
Josie: I got a 1.
Kim: My highest was a 4.
Rhi: Okay. That’s okay. That still is gonna get you information.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire is gonna take 2 points of stress. Josie is gonna take 3.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: Minx is gonna take 3, rather. You’re focusing on Myra, right?
Kim: Yes.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay. You both see- It initially kind of starts just on Myra’s face. She is unconscious or asleep, head lolling forward onto her chest, and then it pulls back to show that she is manacled to a chair in a small room that just has a single bare bulb on the ceiling. Then it keeps pulling out further, and it’s not zooming up necessarily, it’s kind of doing a cross-section of the building and then the area underneath it, so you can see that this is some kind of warehouse and you’re able to see as it pulls back kind of the surrounding area. You don’t necessarily see an address, but you’re like I will recognize this area when I’m standing in front of it. You also see underneath this warehouse there’s a network of tunnels that looks like this is where mushrooms and things are grown for mushroom farming, so that seems like probably a pretty good way to get access to this place.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: You see that, and you have this sense of like, okay, you know where Myra is… Blaire takes her hand back first, and Minx, in that second of extra contact, your vision jumps to… you’re not sure where, you just see, very dimly around you, rushing water, like a lot of water, not like an ocean, maybe a river, and you feel bound and trapped in a way that’s immediately claustrophobic, and you just hear this incredibly loud heartbeat hammering in your ears, and then you take your hand back and it all vanishes.
Josie (as Minx): [deep, exhausted breathing]
Kim (as Blaire): [deep, exhausted breathing] It worked.
Josie: Minx goes down on her knees and hands and is basically acting like she was just drowning, pretty much.
Rhi: Oh geez.
Josie: Like grasping for air.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you okay?
Josie (as Minx): [struggling] Did you see that last part?
Kim (as Blaire): What, with the tunnels?
Josie (as Minx): No. No. There was water, and I couldn’t… I couldn’t move, and… I don’t know, I don’t know what it was, but we both saw the warehouse, right?
Kim (as Blaire): I saw the warehouse.
Josie (as Minx): Okay. All right.
Kim (as Blaire): Here, come on.
Kim: I’m gonna help Minx up and I’m gonna make us some tea.
Josie: Yeah. She’s not entirely out of it, but like, pretty out of it until she gets her tea, like mumbling a little bit about water.
Kim (as Blaire): Shh, it’s okay. You can breathe. It’s okay.
Josie (as Minx): [exhales] Thank you, dear. At the very least I think we know where to look.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi: I think as the two of you are gearing up, we cut back over to that small room in that warehouse where Myra is bound to a chair. Myra, you presented yourself at the safe house, which is this warehouse. You knocked on the door, you stood there for a little bit, and then somebody grabbed you from behind and clamped a cloth over your mouth and that’s the last thing that you remember as you are coming to.
Minna: Nn. As I come to, is there anybody else in this room?
Rhi: No, you’re currently alone in here.
Minna: Fun. Cool-cool-cool.
Rhi: Yeah. You actually might recognize this setup if Salia ever let you stand in, you know, assist, if she was interrogating people.
Minna: Probably yes.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a metal chair that is bolted to the floor and has bindings at ankles and wrists. It’s not rope, these are steel manacles that are part of the chair basically.
Minna: I rattle them even though I know it’s useless.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Salia! I know you’re here somewhere!
Rhi: There’s no response.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs]
Rhi: This was part of her strategy, too. She liked to let people wait.
Minna: Yeah. I think at that point Myra just takes a deep breath and tries to calm down, because if this is the waiting game then she’s not about to be the first one to break.
## Score [0:33:13]
Rhi: All right. So, we are gonna start with the engagement roll as we’re starting off on the score of rescuing Myra. This is gonna be a 2d6 roll. That is a 5, so you’re gonna start in a risky position. I think that it’s probably getting into evening, like probably 6:00 at night, by the time that the two of you get into the tunnels underneath this warehouse. It is a mushroom farm setup. You two are moving through the tunnels, and the first hurdle that you encounter is a pair of guards who are patrolling down here with lanterns, keeping people from stealing the crops basically.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: The two of you are crouched down in the shadows and you can see these two guards approaching. They haven’t seen you yet, but they’ve got lanterns. They look fairly alert.
Josie: Do I spy weapons on them?
Rhi: Looks like they are armed with truncheons. It’s possible that they’ve got other weapons hidden away, but that’s what you see immediately.
Josie: All right. I don’t see guns immediately.
Rhi: Correct.
Josie: I’m gonna have a pistol. Yeah. I’m just gonna try and intimidate these guys. I’m just gonna step around the corner, pistol pointed at one of their heads—
Kim: Oh Jesus.
Josie (as Minx): Go home and stay quiet.
Rhi: Roll something. I mean, that sounds like a Command.
Josie: Yes, but I am gonna take 2 stress to make it a Sway, because I have that ability.
Rhi: All right. Yes you do.
Josie: Four.
Rhi: Okay. You are meant to have a 4. [laughs]
Josie: [laughing] Four, four, four.
Rhi: Okay. I think it’s gonna be reduced effect. You only get one of them. The one who- I imagine that you just like, as they’re walking past your hiding place, you step out and have the gun almost at this guy’s temple.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So he just kind of is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Uh… Yeah. No, I don’t want any trouble.
Rhi: And unhooks the little holster thing that’s holding his truncheon to his belt, and that falls to the floor, and he’s got his hands up.
Rhi (as Guard): I don’t get paid enough to get shot for this job.
Rhi: [laughs] Just backing away, hands in the air.
Rhi (as Guard): I’ll go! I’ll go.
Rhi: The other guard…
Josie (as Minx): Good lad.
Rhi: …makes a face at his friend and pulls out his truncheon and does not seem to be as intimidated by you.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Blaire, you have not been seen yet. You have the element of surprise if you would like to do something here.
Kim: Yes. I have a bit of an idea.
Rhi: Mm-hmm?
Kim: I would like to threaten this man with possession.
Rhi: Jesus!
Josie: Wow!
[laughter]
Rhi: All right!
Kim: [smiling] Because I have a ghost on me, as I always do.
Rhi: Yeah, of course you have a ghost jar with you. Jesus.
Kim: Yeah. So I’m gonna sneak up on him and, well, yeah no, I just wanna sneak up on him and be like hey, I have a ghost on me, leave or I’ll possess you, or rather the ghost will possess you.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: That sounds like a Command…?
Rhi: Probably.
Kim: Devil’s Bargain, actually?
Rhi: I think no matter how this goes the ghost in the jar is gonna get out.
Kim: Oh, oh dear.
Rhi: Might not necessarily possess this guy, but is gonna get out.
Kim: Eh, I don’t know if I wanna unleash that much chaos yet.
Rhi: It is rather early.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: I know, I was gonna say. I know that sounds antithetical to my character, but it is early. So, I’m just gonna roll the one and hope for the best.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: To be fair, it is early, but I’m already at 7 stress.
Kim: What?! Already?!
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I started the session with 2. I took 3 from the Eye of Kotar and I took 2 to Command just then.
Minna: Minx! Honey!
Kim: [long groan]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Well… I should have just taken stress anyway. I’m an idiot. That would be a 3.
Rhi: Okay. [exhales] Yeah, I think he’s gonna whip around and crack you upside the head with this truncheon. You’re gonna take level 2 harm as he wallops you real good. You can resist that.
Kim: Yes, I would like to.
Rhi: Yeah, that is Prowess.
Josie: Having armor might be a good idea for this one.
Rhi: Oh! Or armor, yeah, yeah-yeah.
Kim: Yeah! I never use armor, even though Needle told me to.
Rhi: We constantly forget that it’s an option.
Kim: That’s true.
Rhi: So just mark 2 of your load and that will drop it down to level 1 harm. It’ll just be, like, Bruised.
Josie: All right. He attacked fucking Blaire. He’s getting shot.
Rhi: [chuckles] Roll it.
Josie: That’s not good. That’s a 1.
Kim: Oh no~! What is wrong with our dice tonight?!
Rhi: That’s not good at all… Okay. You fire a gun in caverns underneath the city. It’s very, very loud.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: And I think… Yeah, I’m gonna start a clock.
Kim: No…
Rhi: You’re at 1 out of 4, Guards Alerted. Minx takes that shot and we briefly cut to Myra, who’s still just sitting there, nobody’s come to see you. [laughs] It’s been hours. You’re very sore, but you hear this cracking sound distantly.
Minna (as Myra): Damn it. I told them—
Rhi: [smiling] You didn’t think they would listen, did you? So, yeah, the shot goes wild, the guy ducked, there’s sort of a little spore cloud as the bullet strikes a bunch of mushrooms glowing on the wall. He’s still up. I think his friend has just booked it. He’s like I don’t- Nope! I’m out! Screw this!
Josie: Yup. [laughs]
Kim: It’s above my paygrade.
Rhi: Yeah, so far above his paygrade. Blaire!
Kim: Yes?
Rhi: What do you wanna do?
Kim: Um… I guess I gotta zap this guy.
Rhi: Zap him.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: And they are fine lightning hooks, so you’re gonna be at greater effect. Still risky position, but you can…
Kim: That’s fine. We’ve used Skirmish in the past haven’t we for this?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: All right. [nervously] Eh, that’s a 4.
Rhi: Four, okay. So, you do it, but there’s a consequence. In a little bit of a panic you kinda hit some buttons and switches on your lightning hooks to overcharge them, so you zap this guy and he just goes down, he is just unconscious, but you used up pretty much the rest of the electroplasmic charge.
Kim: Oh, I’m out of juice.
Rhi: But, you took that guy out.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh God, I think I killed him… Minx, I think I killed him.
Josie: Minx will put her two fingers on his neck.
Rhi: Yeah, he’s alive. I don’t know if weird stuff happens to your pulse after you get electrocuted, but…
Kim: Probably.
Rhi: He’s not, like, you can tell he’s not in great shape, there’s sort of a burning smell in the air, but he is alive at the moment.
Josie (as Minx): No, he’s alive. Let’s hurry on.
Kim (as Blaire): [unsure] Okay.
Rhi: If it was desperate I would have killed him. [laughs] All right. Blaire and Minx having dealt with the guards set off into the tunnels, and we pan up back into that room where Myra is sitting and has been sitting for a while. You’re pretty just physically uncomfortable. You’re thirsty, your wrists hurt, you can’t really shift position too much so probably parts are starting to go numb from the way you’ve been sitting on them. The door swings open, and Salia walks in.
Kim: Oh shit.
Rhi: What does she look like?
Minna: My best answer is still largely older Myra? Like, kind of very severe looking person, hair tightly back. I pictured her dark hair—
Rhi: I think she’s got some gray in her hair.
Minna: yeah, with dark hair but with gray in it.
Rhi: Yeah. So she steps inside and shuts the door behind her, just kinda looks you over for a long, silent minute. Eventually, Salia shakes her head a little and says:
Rhi (as Salia): Well, I expect this isn’t precisely what you had in mind when you threw your little temper tantrum and ran away.
Minna (as Myra): It’s really adorable that you call that a temper tantrum.
Rhi (as Salia): And it’s adorable that you thought you could get away. You always knew how this was going to end, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): On the contrary, I still think it could end another way. And even if it doesn’t, I had my time off, I had my time without you. I did better things than being your lackey forever, which is I’m sure all that Clave, Ojal and Wester will ever be.
Rhi (as Salia): That is rather the plan. You don’t want anyone who could… outpace you. [breathing heavily] There’s no sense in that.
Minna (as Myra): It’s very funny. They all think they’re going places.
Rhi (as Salia): [chuckles] I choose my associates for a number of skills, but…
Minna (as Myra): But most of all their compliance, isn’t that true?
Rhi (as Salia): Of course.
Minna (as Myra): Except you didn’t choose so well with me.
Rhi (as Salia): Well, you were less a choice and more random happenstance, weren’t you?
Rhi: I think at this point she steps in and plants her hands on the back of your chair, right over your shoulders.
Minna: Like behind me? She’s standing behind me? Egh…
Rhi: No, she’s leaning down, so like face to face.
Minna: Oh, still egh…
Rhi (as Salia): [severely] You owe me everything. Your mother’s spirit would have devoured you if I hadn’t brought you to that Whisper, and you would’ve died in that miserable little hovel.
Kim: [long gasp]
Josie: [breathy] Oh God.
Rhi (as Salia): Everything you are now you owe to me. I gave you everything, Myra, and that gives me every right to take it away.
Minna (as Myra): There’s a limit, and you passed it long ago.
Rhi (as Salia): Hmph.
Rhi: She straightens up.
Rhi (as Salia): We’ll see about that, girl. Now, I am not actually interested in bringing you back into the fold, I think we both know that ship has long since sailed, but you, it turns out, are a lot more useful outside of my organization than in it. I was willing to let you run off and eventually come to your senses, but then Clave ran into you at that auction and I realized that you had crossed the Circle of Flame, and well, then, I could hardly pass up such an opportunity. You and your friends are going to get me into their ranks.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] It’s just so typical of you.
Rhi: Almost casually, she just backhands you.
Rhi (as Salia): Don’t interrupt when I’m speaking, Myra. You know the rules.
Minna (as Myra): I stopped playing by your rules a long time ago.
Rhi (as Salia): And look where that got you; carving out some miserable little existence with, what, a petty thief and a dropout?
Minna (as Myra): Better than aping wealth and thinking that you earned it.
Rhi (as Salia): I’ve earned everything that I have, and now I’m going to earn my place in the ranks of people who hold true power in this city, and it’s going to start when they collect you.
Rhi: And… I think she’s gonna turn to leave. Myra can get in one last parting shot if she’d like.
Minna (as Myra): You always knew I was a fighter, so I don’t know why you thought this would end any other way. This was all worth it, just for that time without you.
Rhi (as Salia): I hope your friend feels the same way.
Rhi: Clang, as the door shuts. We stay on Myra for a second. How does Myra look now that she’s alone again?
Minna: She doesn’t cry, because that would be losing, but I think, like… The camera shows her looking very, very shaken and her hands clenched into fists as she tries to hold in that feeling.
Rhi: Yeah. So, we pan down from Myra to the floor where there is a pretty decent size grate down into the tunnels where Blaire and Minx just heard everything.
Minna: [strained whine]
Kim: We did?!
Rhi: Yeah, you did, you heard all of that.
Kim: Oh…
Rhi: Most of it. You probably missed the opening few sentences, but you heard all of that exchange.
Josie (as Minx): Well, we’re going up through that grate, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh yeah, no, absolutely.
Josie: I think maybe as we pan down to the grate Myra’s in silence and then there’s a little ‘clink’ as a little grappling type hook comes up through the grate and hooks on. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Yes!
Minna: Myra turns to look at it, if she can see it from her angle.
Rhi: I think it’s kind of, like, it’s behind the chair a little bit.
Minna: Oh cool, so she just kinda looks around wildly and there is nothing.
Josie: I wanna climb up the rope, up to the grate, and say:
Josie (as Minx): Hello dear. I thought we had an agreement not to split up.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] And I thought I told you to stay at home.
Josie (as Minx): Eh, I’ve never been one to follow instructions very well. Seems like you aren’t either.
Minna (as Myra): No.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! This is our one rule that you were supposed to follow. What the hell, Myra?
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): I’m sorry. There wasn’t- I didn’t have a better plan.
Kim (as Blaire): You could have come to us.
Minna (as Myra): I didn’t have the time and I didn’t have the energy to argue with you, because if I had tried to say that to your face I don’t think I could have.
Josie (as Minx): Girls, as much as this conversation needs to be had now is not the place to have it.
Kim (as Blaire): Right. Let’s get you out of here and then we’ll yell at you back at The Nest.
Josie (as Minx): Myra, if I pass up to you a blade will you be able to free yourself?
Minna (as Myra): My hands and my ankles are manacled to this chair. I don’t think I have enough freedom of movement for that.
Kim: Remind me again what it is that the ghost key does?
Rhi: Opens ghost locks.
Kim: Oh. This isn’t a ghost lock. Okay.
Rhi: You don’t know.
Josie: Haven’t checked.
Rhi: That’s the thing with the ghost key, it’s kind of a “well, let’s find out if it’ll do something.” You never know where there are ghost doors and ghost locks in the city until you check, so if you wanna try and do something…
Kim: Okay, that’s a 5.
Rhi: I will give you a choice.
Kim: Okay?
Rhi: Either you are able to unlock something that will get you through the grate or the ghost key will unlock all of the stuff binding Myra when you get up there.
Kim: Myra.
Rhi: Okay. You look into the ghost field and see the outline of Myra up there, and then glowing very brightly with, just sort of repeated use, a lot of people have been in those manacles, they’ve been locked and unlocked a lot, you can see the locks on these bindings glowing in the ghost field. You’re pretty sure once you get up there you can just unlock them all with your ghost key, but you gotta get up there.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, do you have any ideas?
Kim (as Blaire): Explode it?
Josie (as Minx): If you pass me out some explosives, I will do that.
Rhi: [laughs] Myra – “Uhh?! You know I’m bolted to a—”
Minna (as Myra): I cannot move.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Not large explosives, just something to pop this.
Minna (as Myra): Well, I guess that’s better than getting killed by Salia, or the Circle of Flame rather.
Josie (as Minx): Quite.
Rhi: All right, so… yeah. Whatcha doing?
Josie: Yeah. I wanna try and shove… what have we got in there? Is it only TNT?
Rhi: No. I think we’ve, you know, we’ve got alchemy and magic. You can have something that’s kind of like a shape charge. It’ still an explosive, so you’re not exactly sure what this is gonna do to Myra. [laughs]
Josie: Right. I just wanna pack some firecracker level shit in between the bars…
Rhi: Just trying to weaken the bars?
Josie: Yeah, and where it meets the floor, so hopefully the small explosion is beneath the grate and it just pops it up.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, I see what you’re saying. Yeah, you can definitely try and do that.
Josie: And it’s a weak explosive, but I just shove as much as I can into one area.
Rhi: Heh. Yeah. Okay, yeah, go ahead and roll something. Would you like a Devil’s Bargain?
Josie: Yeah. What does that look like?
Rhi: It’s gonna be 2 more ticks on the clock no matter what. Like, you may get additional ticks based on this roll, but no matter what you’re taking 2 more ticks.
Josie: Oh yeah, that’s exciting, let’s do this. [laughs]
Rhi: All right.
Josie: That’s a 5.
Rhi: So, you do it but there’s a consequence. So, [laughs] Myra, you just hear some quiet murmuring behind you, kind of the sound of Minx [struggled panting], grunting as she’s shoving stuff into this little compact area, and then the hiss of a fuse going, and you brace yourself as best you can, and then there’s a loud pop and then a clatter as I think it falls out like it’s on a hinge, you just blew one side of it out, so the grate has opened up. However, you just set off an explosion.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: Myra, you can hear footsteps running outside, like it sounds like somebody’s running towards the room that you’re locked in and you’re just still stuck in this chair.
Minna (as Myra): Hey, we’ve got incoming.
Josie: Minx is gonna clamber up through the hole where the grate is, trying hard to keep what she’s wearing from getting too mussed, but now it’s very dirty and there’s soot on it.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: She climbs up, sighs dejectedly.
Josie (as Minx): Well, Blaire, you have the key.
Josie: Then I think I’m going to… Yeah, I’m gonna have my normal sword in one hand, pistol in the other, and train them both right on the door.
Rhi: Blaire, you don’t even need to do a roll. I think you can just look into the ghost field and see where the locks are and just get them open.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: Because you did the roll to find them earlier, basically. Yeah, you unlock all of those, and Myra, you are able to stand up, and I think as you do the door is gonna open. Wester is there with a gun in his hands.
Josie: Shooting him.
Rhi: All right. Go ahead and roll it.
Josie: I have a way things could go down here, and it’s contingent on whether Minx is shooting to kill or not.
Rhi: … Oh. [laughs]
Josie: Which she might be.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: But I’m trying to decide whether she would, because if she is, she is most likely gonna take trauma in this situation.
Rhi: I don’t know. It’s up to you.
Josie: The door opens, she fires.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: And she’s not aiming for center of mass.
Rhi: Roll it.
Josie: Yep, and I’m gonna take that stress to make sure of it.
Rhi: Push yourself?
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: All right…
Josie: That’s a 4.
Rhi: Okay. It’s reduced effect, so you don’t kill him. You shoot him, and I think it’s one of those where like, it grazes along—I assume you were aiming for his head, and I think he just barely manages to jerk out of the way, but it grazes along the side of his head, so he has a, because head wounds bleed horribly, he has a very bloody graze along the side of his head now. I think he, seeing how close you are, rather than shooting you just tackles you. the two of you are fighting over your various guns.
Josie: Maybe they were already climbing down, and when the door opened Myra dropped down the rope further with Blaire, and then in the ensuing struggle I knock the rope loose?
Rhi: Yeah, I think that works. The two of you hit the ground down in the tunnel and the rope just falls down.
Minna (as Myra): I know a way. The fastest way I think is through the tunnels to street level. I know the way.
Kim (as Blaire): O-Okay.
Rhi: So, the two of you take off at a run. Myra, yeah, you know exactly how to get back up to street access. As you burst onto the street there’s a cellar door that you clamber out of just in time to see Ojal with a pistol at her hip and a couple knives as well. Myra, you recognize this as her ‘being sent on a killing mission’ get-up, swings into a carriage.
Minna: Uh… Am I to assume this is going after Jeren?
Rhi: Salia definitely implied when she was leaving that Jeren was not going to make it out of this alive.
Minna: Okay… Hmm. Hmm! [into hands] Let’s drop back into character.
Rhi: I think the carriage starts clattering away, Myra and Blaire are standing there, and Josie, describe Minx’s entrance onto the street. [laughs]
Josie: Okay. We start a little ways back in the building. We are hearing a clamor as the camera moves on the outside slowly towards the front of the building, and Minx essentially breaks through a window in her escape.
Rhi: [laughs] Naturally, I think that Minx gets a cool, sexy forehead cut, but that’s the only injury from jumping through the window.
Josie: Yeah, although given what just… Well, I’m gonna ask right now. Did Wester survive this?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: I’m not gonna have him die off-screen, but yeah. He survived, but decided discretion was the better part of valor and booked it when it became clear you were trying to kill him.
Josie: Right. So, she’s got the sexy forehead cut, but also there’s very clearly a bloody handprint smeared across her chest.
Rhi: Ooh.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Nice.
Josie (as Minx): Ahem. Sorry, wasn’t about to let us get split up again. Where are we going? What are we doing?
Minna (as Myra): Ojal just jumped in a carriage, and I’m pretty sure I know where she’s heading. Well, I don’t know where she’s heading. I know she is heading to go kill somebody that I care about. Will you help me stop her?
Josie (as Minx): Absolutely. Yeah, we came here to help you.
Minna (as Myra): And honestly, bless you for never being able to follow instructions.
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): Well, yeah.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know what I did to deserve you two.
Kim (as Blaire): You are a good person? And you’re our friend?
Minna (as Myra): Yes. Well… [deep breath] Let’s get after that.
Josie: Yeah. Is there another carriage?
Rhi: I think there’s basically a cab lineup outside of here. So yeah, there’s a couple other cabs and carriages that you all can either attempt to hire the cabbie or, you know, grand theft goat.
Kim: Goat theft auto!
Rhi: [laughs] There’s a woman seated atop the carriage who looks over and her eyes get a little wide at the sight of the three of you who are, at best, a couple of you are mussed and dirty, one of you is bloody. What do you do?
Josie (as Minx): Please follow that carriage, dear.
Josie: She’s making no attempt to hide the bloody handprint.
Minna (as Myra): This isn’t a request.
Rhi (as Cabbie): O-Okay… Hop in.
Rhi: I think that these are an open top carriage thing, it’s not an enclosed space, so you all have like—And Ojal was in the same setup, so you all have kind of clear view on each other.
Josie (as Minx): So Myra, real quick, who are they going after?
Minna (as Myra): They’re going after a longtime informant and friend.
Kim (as Blaire): Who is this informant?
Minna (as Myra): His name is Jeren.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Minna (as Myra): I thought I’d kept him secret, but apparently I did not, so it’s just as well.
Josie (as Minx): Well, you kept him secret from us somehow.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Why are you keeping secrets from us?
Minna (as Myra): It’s a secret I’ve kept longer than I’ve known any of you.
Josie (as Minx): Is this the promise you spoke of?
Minna (as Myra): Yes. I told him I would keep him out of everything that I did. He’s the one who provides a lot of information to me. Usually if I’m able to provide information on Bluecoat stuff it’s from him.
Josie (as Minx): If that’s true, he has helped us out quite a bit. I would have liked to thank him. This week is really my week for getting secrets revealed to me, isn’t it? Anyway.
Rhi: So, we’ve got a pair of racing clocks here.
Minna: [pleased] Ah~
Rhi: You all are- Actually, I’m gonna change this. Ojal is at 1 out of 8. You all are at 0 out of 8.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: She has a lead on you. You can encourage, [chuckles], the cabbie to go faster, you can attempt to take control of the cab yourselves, but basically you are gonna have to make some rolls to move your progress forward.
Kim: I think we should encourage her first before we force her.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: That’s fair. [giggles]
Minna: I also have better rolls to encourage than to force.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: So yeah, go ahead and start making some rolls. The cabbie I think got the sense that this is an urgent mission but perhaps does not realize the depth of the urgency here and so is moving quickly but not as fast as you would like.
Kim: Move faster or you’re not getting five stars for this ride.
[laughter]
Minna: I have to decide what I’m rolling. I think it’s a command because of how stressed out she is right now.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: It is a 4.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: So I think Myra leans forward, and she says:
Minna (as Myra): Please, please try to speed up, because lives are on the line here.
Rhi (as Cabbie): Uh, okay.
Rhi: She whips the reins that are on the goats and they pick up speed. The consequence here is, yeah, you mentioned that Myra is very stressed, so you are gonna take harm, level 2 harm, of basically just terror. You are terrified for your friend right now.
Minna: I would like to resist that.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: And that’s a 6, so I take 0 stress and I knock it down to a level 1.
Rhi: All right. So, let me make a roll for Ojal here. You have caught up to her. Now here’s the thing, you can’t really get past her because you have to follow her to wherever she’s going. If you get ahead of her on the clock that basically means you have some kind of advantage when you arrive.
Minna: What’s the policy on jumping into her cab?
Rhi: The policy is that’s fucking brilliant and you should do it.
Josie: Yeah! [laughs] ‘Cause, jeez…
Minna: What are we rolling on that?
Rhi: I don’t know!
Josie: That sounds like Finesse?
Rhi: I mean, or Skirmish? Or Prowl?
Minna: Skirmish is my best roll of those.
Rhi: With Skirmish it is a flying leap attack.
Minna: I mean, that’s absolutely the plan.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I am gonna take 2 stress to push myself.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] So, Blaire and Minx are like “don’t you ever leave us again!” Myra’s like, “Bye!”
Kim: Myra’s like, “Yeet!”
Josie (as Minx): Myra!
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: Five, okay. Yeah, I think that the carriages pull up next to each other and Ojal looks over at you and is kind of surprised, and then is more surprised as Myra launches herself across into the cab. Ojal recovers pretty quickly, whips out one of those knives, and is lunging at you going for your throat. You’re in a desperate position, Myra. Now, I want to remind the other two that if Ojal dies before you reach your destination you won’t- It’s gonna be hard for you to find Jeren.
Minna: Oh, fuck me. I didn’t think of that.
Josie: Just subdue her. Just subdue her. It’s fine. You don’t gotta kill her.
Minna: Wait. The cabbie has the destination. I don’t need Ojal, I just need the cabbie. [laughs]
Rhi: That’s true. You’re correct. Myra has just launched herself into this other cab and is in a knife fight without a knife at the moment.
Minna: Wait. Do I have any load?
Josie: No, you don’t.
Rhi: Yeah, Myra, you would have had anything on you would have been removed.
Minna: Oh, oh yeah, uh-huh.
Rhi: Yeah, you do not have any load.
Minna: Ooh, this is fun. [nervous smiling] This is exciting.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: Real quick. What am I actually allowed to do? Because I came back in before I think technically trauma accounts for, which you do, you come in with no stress and your stuff is satisfied. Do I still have all of my stuff? Am I allowed to start pushing myself again?
Rhi: Let me look. Yeah, you’re otherwise dropped out of the current conflict. Technically yeah, you did come back probably before the rules intended that you would.
Josie: Oh, okay.
Rhi: I am gonna say, you do not have access to your stress pool right now. Does that seem fair?
Josie: That does seem fair.
Rhi: So you can’t push yourself, you can’t resist harm or consequences, you just kinda have to take it.
Josie: Mm-hmm. I’m gonna toss my sheathed cane sword over to Myra.
Rhi: Okay. I would say Prowl or Finesse.
Josie: That’s a 3.
Rhi: Okay…
Josie: Do I just lose my cane sword?
Rhi: Yeah, I think you lost your cane sword.
Josie: God damn it. [laughs]
Kim: [growls] No~!
Rhi: Sorry. Yeah, it bounces off the side of the cab and just hits the ground and is gone.
Kim: Top 10 anime deaths.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, I think that’s pretty much it for the cane sword.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that wasn’t cheap.
Rhi: Blaire, what would you like to do?
Kim: Eh… I’m not really good at anything in this kind of situation…
Rhi: There’s always ghosts around.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: High speed ghosting.
Kim: I could try commanding a ghost, I guess.
Rhi: You gotta find a ghost, but yeah.
Kim: Yeah. Let me roll Attune to find a ghost. Let me just find a friend first.
Rhi: This is gonna be risky.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 6.
Rhi: Nice! So, you slap your mask on, look into the ghost field wildly, and you very quickly spot a ghost in the cab with you, just sitting on the seat watching all of this unfolding.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh hey, what’s up?
Rhi (as Ghost): Ah, this is almost as exciting as when I died. What are you all up to?
Minna: Heh.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, trying to beat someone—We’re racing.
Rhi (as Ghost): Ohh.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. You want in?
Rhi (as Ghost): Um, well, I’m dead, so I’m not sure how much help I can be.
Kim (as Blaire): Can you just like scare the shit out of the other cab so we can win?
Rhi (as Ghost): Do you want me to scare the cabbie or the person with the knife over there?
Kim (as Blaire): Go for the stabby person.
Rhi (as Ghost): All right.
Kim (as Blaire): And try not to let them, you know, stab the person they’ve got a knife over?
Rhi (as Ghost): I’ll do what I can.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks!
Rhi: I think… Give me just another Attune roll. This is kind of a fortune roll. This isn’t necessarily gonna be you taking stress for this, it’s just gonna be seeing how well this ghost does at doing a spook.
Kim: That’s double 5s.
Rhi: Okay, 5, that’s actually good. The ghost goes over. Myra, you just feel the cab that you’re in as you’re dodging knife swipes from Ojal, it gets really, really cold, and you can see Ojal’s eyes dart around starting to look a little nervous. I’m trying to see how setup actions work, because I feel like sending this ghost over is a setup action. Okay, so you can either have a +1 effect level, so it would be desperate-greater, or improved position, so it would be risky-standard, for your interacting with Ojal here for your next roll.
Minna: Let’s go for risky-standard.
Rhi: Okay. She is withdrawn enough that you are no longer in a desperate position, but she does still have a knife and a desire to murder the crap out of you, and you are unarmed.
Minna: Yeah… I’m gonna push myself again.
Rhi: Okay, and what are you gonna do?
Minna: I was rolling a Skirmish, and uh… that’s a 3.
Rhi: Okay! You lunge in bare-handed at someone with a knife. You get stabbed. Yeah, that’s about how that’s gonna go.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: Yeah. She stabs you in the shoulder. You’re gonna take level 2 harm.
Minna: I’m gonna resist it, and I rolled a 6.
Rhi: What the hell?! [laughs]
Minna: I know. I’m sorry. If I could roll those 6s on rolls that did something, it would be nice.
Rhi: Okay. It’s a level 1.
Minna: Yeah, Stabbed.
Rhi: No, I think you manage to twist so that it’s just you got a cool bicep cut.
Josie: Real quick, Ojal is like above Myra right now?
Rhi: I think they’re both on their feet and—
Minna: We’re like grappling on our feet.
Rhi: Yeah, in a moving cab.
Minna: Yeah. It’s really cool. [laughs]
Josie: So, it would be super risky to shoot them then.
Rhi: Yeah, that would be a desperate move, because the odds of shooting someone you don’t intend to shoot are quite high.
Josie: Um, fuck. I don’t…
Rhi: You can try to jump across.
Josie: Yeah. Myra was allowed to use Skirmish for that, right?
Rhi: Because she made it into an attack, she jumped on Ojal.
Josie: Yeah, I mean, I’m gonna try and do the same thing, because that’s what I got, really.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. It’s gonna be risky.
Josie: Yep, sure is.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Four! Oh. [relieved]
Rhi: There you go~ I think you and Ojal kind of collide and there’s some grappling for a bit, and then she just, with sort of surprising strength just grabs you and throws you, and you almost- you do go out of the cab, but you manage to catch the back, so you’re now clinging to the back of a speeding cab.
Josie: Oh God.
Rhi: You are in a desperate position. If you let go you’re gonna hit the ground pretty hard.
Josie: Not letting go.
Rhi: Yeah, so you’re just kinda hanging on back there while Ojal turns back to Myra. Blaire?
Kim: I think Myra can fend for herself for now. My focus is gonna be on Minx.
Rhi: Minx is in a much more precarious position.
Kim: Yes. I’m not sure what I can do to help her out is the thing.
Rhi: You could tell the cabbie to slow a little bit so that you could reach over and try to grab her and pull her in.
Kim: Yeah, I guess I’ll do that.
Rhi: Telling the cabbie that doesn’t require a roll. The roll is gonna be being able to grab Minx and get her back safely into your cab.
Kim: Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Slow down! Slow down. We’ve almost got someone overboard here.
Rhi (as Cabbie): [stammers] By the gods! What is—Agh! I’m gonna expect a very good tip for this!
Kim (as Blaire): Just drive! You’ll get tipped if we live.
Rhi: Slows down enough that you can reach over to where Minx is, and yeah, give me a roll.
Kim: Is it Finesse to try and grab her?
Rhi: Could be Finesse, could be Prowl.
Kim: I mean, same difference, I only have 1 dot in both. Here, can I push myself? I’ll push myself.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Oh no. That’s double 2s.
Rhi: So you are reaching out for Minx and a shot fires over your head, and you instinctively flinch back. You look to see, coming up behind you, two Bluecoat carriages.
Minna: Ohhh good.
Josie: Ohh.
Rhi: [laughing] Who have noticed the fact that there’s some kind of speeding cab fight happening and are now in pursuit. [laughter] So, you have the Bluecoats chasing you all now. You’re being hollered at to stop. Both, I’m picturing that simultaneously both Ojal and Blaire are like “don’t stop!” to the drivers. The drivers also don’t want to get arrested, so they keep going. Who’s doing what?
Minna: Uh…
Kim: Screaming?
Minna: I still wanna punch her…
Rhi: Do it.
Minna: What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: You kept something important on you when you went in, something that had sentimental value, and you did not get it back when you left the warehouse. It’s just lost to you now.
Minna: Oh… Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Rhi: What was it?
Minna: I think it was, like, I established back in the festival episode that people who love you can make you charms to ward off bad luck or something. Yeah, the one my mom made me is gone.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: [seethes] All right. Okay.
Minna: All right, rolling three for this Skirmish. Yes! I rolled a critical. The sacrifice was worth it!
Josie: Perfect.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: So… Yeah. I think I’m gonna let you take her out with this. It’s up to you if you want it to be fatal.
Minna: I almost think it makes more sense to punch her out, because all she’s thinking is “I need her out of here, I need her gone.” She’s not going to get her to give her answers, and even keeping her in the carriage will make her a threat.
Rhi: Okay. Myra dodges under a swing and just tackles Ojal out of the carriage.
Josie: Minx watches as she speeds by her.
Rhi: Yeah. And then, I don’t think you really see what happens. The Bluecoats, you hear shouting from the Bluecoats as they try to stop and there’s some clattering, clamoring sounds, but I think that you all are going, you go around a curve and you don’t see what happens to her. You kind of keep racing away. Myra, I think you’re able to help Minx safely into the cab. The Bluecoats… You’re pretty sure that she’s not dead, because you don’t hear the death bell going. The Bluecoats all had to stop to avoid running over this person, so I think that you all are able to have the cabbies stop, you pay your cabbie…
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: …who is like, the fuck, and then pile into Ojal’s cab and are like “wherever she was going, take us there!” And you pull up to a small house, kind of run down, in Crow’s Foot.
Minna: Which hideout is this?
Rhi: It’s one that Myra’s not familiar with.
Minna: Oh.
Rhi: Myra hasn’t seen this one. Yeah.
Minna: I guess that makes sense. Heh.
Rhi: Yeah. You’ve been gone for a bit. She has some new places. You pull up outside and the door opens, and you know, somebody that, Myra, you don’t recognize, probably some hired muscle steps out, and the three of you look like hell. There’s blood, you’re all very mussed, and I think at least two of you just level weapons at this person. And again, it’s just like, you know what, I don’t get paid enough, I’m not getting shot for this job.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Salia needs to pay her goons better. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. Well, you know. Minx and Blaire keep the guard at weapon point outside and Myra goes rushing into the house. You find just in one of the bedrooms, also tied to a chair, and unconscious, and badly beaten…
Minna: [sad groan]
Rhi: …like, bloodied, bruised, looks like he’s got a broken arm, is Jeren.
Minna: I think Myra just starts untying him.
Minna (as Myra): Jeren…
Rhi (as Jeren): [groans groggily, then in pain, seethes]
Minna (as Myra): It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay. We’re here to save you.
Rhi (as Jeren): Ow… Shit! [huffs]
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I know. We’ll get you patched up.
Rhi (as Jeren): I guess you weren’t kidding about it being dangerous to be around you.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sorry. I really tried to keep you out of it. I don’t know how she found out. It’s probably my fault.
Rhi: I think he just kinda shakes his head and will, you know, if you help him stand he’ll very pained stand.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: His blue coat is just gone, but the rest of the uniform is there and in pretty bad shape. But yeah, he’ll lean on you as you help him back out front.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
## Downtime [1:18:20]
Rhi: All right, so for downtime… Myra, I imagine you probably take Jeren over to Seeks.
Minna: Yeah, I take Jeren to Seeks. That’s probably also where I get my healing done.
Rhi: Yeah. Seeks looks very concerned when you bring him in and I think gives you some kind of painkiller tea, and then spends probably a good hour working on patching him up, has to set the broken bones in his arm…
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: He’s in rough shape.
Minna: Yeah. I think she takes a cat nap in a chair or something.
Rhi: Yeah. Then eventually Seeks will come over and patch you up as well, and then will just sort of excuse herself to the back sensing that probably you two need some time to chat. I think Jeren is just lying flat on his back on the cot and is just staring at the ceiling and is not really saying much. I mean, staring at the ceiling with one eye, his other eye is kind of swollen shut.
Minna (as Myra): Hey. Feeling any better?
Rhi (as Jeren): [dazed] Uh… I’m not feeling a lot. Whatever your friend gave me is pretty effective.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, that sounds about right. [chuckles] Listen, I’m sorry.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah… I would certainly hope so. I mean, you know, you warned me that what you were in was dangerous, but uh… I did not realize how dangerous or how much I’d get pulled into it.
Minna (as Myra): You weren’t supposed to be pulled into it.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, well…
Minna (as Myra): [heavy exhale] She’s my old boss.
Rhi (as Jeren): Huh.
Minna (as Myra): Reason I met you in the first place.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. That’s… I don’t know what that is. There’s probably a word for it.
Minna (as Myra): There isn’t a word for it. It’s just bad.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah…
Minna (as Myra): The thing is, information is kind of her job; buying it, selling it, hoarding it. Now that she knows about you, I don’t know how safe you are. I don’t have the power to protect you, and clearly your father being who he is wasn’t enough to stop her coming after you, so I don’t know what happens next, and I really, really wish I did.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, I don’t know either. I mean, I don’t want to leave town, but uh, I… don’t wanna spend three days locked in a room getting the shit beat out of me either, although I imagine next time they’d probably just skip straight to the killing.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I imagine so. I’m not gonna lie to you, it’s bad.
Rhi (as Jeren): Is it worth it?
Minna (as Myra): Putting you at risk, or everything?
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. Yeah, this all you’re doing, is that worth my life?
Minna (as Myra): I think that’s up to you. It’s a choice that you get to make. It’s worth my life, but whether it’s worth yours, that’s something you have to figure out for yourself.
Rhi (as Jeren): I don’t know it is my choice, Myra.
Rhi: I think he finally rolls his head to the side and looks at you.
Rhi (as Jeren): I’m only in this mess because of you. You piss people off and do what you do out in the city, and maybe it’s for a good cause, I don’t know, but you and your friends are the ones putting everybody at risk, so it’s not really my choice.
Minna (as Myra): [tearful] I really should have told you. I should have told you how dangerous these people were. I thought you knew. I thought you knew once you knew that I was a criminal, that I was involved with these… I thought you understood… [deep breath]
Rhi (as Jeren): You don’t tell me much of anything, Myra, and I don’t usually want you to tell me much of anything, because then I can do my job and sleep at night and all that shit. But I don’t know… you’re in deep, and you’re dragging us down with you, and you gotta decide if whatever you’re chasing is worth… everything.
Minna (as Myra): I can’t stop now. Even if I wanted to, I can’t stop now.
Rhi: He just lets out a really heavy sigh and then coughs a little bit and presses a hand to his ribs.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, I was pretty sure you were gonna say that.
Rhi: Then he looks back at the ceiling and closes his eyes and is giving every impression of someone who’s going to sleep, but you’re pretty sure he’s not asleep, he’s just done talking.
Minna: I think Myra stands up and is gonna go, but she kinda hesitates.
Minna (as Myra): I didn’t expect to care about you as much as I did. I’m sorry that I didn’t let you go, and I should have, but it’s too late now. We have to figure it out. It’s up to you what you do with this. I’ll do my best for you, but I can’t offer much. You, you have, you have a lot on me. Do with that what you will.
Rhi: I don’t think he says anything. Does Myra just head out?
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah, I don’t know where that’s gonna go yet.
Minna: Yeah… He has to figure that out.
Rhi: So, I think we follow Myra as she makes her way back through the city, back home to The Nest. What are Blaire and Minx doing while they’re waiting for her to come back?
Kim: I think I’m cuddling on the couch with Hex.
Rhi: Very good. How about Minx?
Josie: Minx has spent- She spends a lot of time in front of a mirror, but this is an inordinate amount of time in front of a mirror doing nothing. She’s just waiting.
Rhi: Just staring at her reflection?
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: So, Myra comes in.
Josie: As soon as Myra comes in, Minx is gonna turn and move in for a hug.
Minna (as Myra): Oh! Hi…
Minna: She hugs her back.
Josie (as Minx): I’m so glad you’re okay.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, me too. I thought I was dead there.
Josie (as Minx): Heh. If you were dead I was gonna make sure it wasn’t alone. That’s not how we roll, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, why didn’t you come to us?
Minna (as Myra): [tearful] Honestly, I thought you were gonna talk me out of it.
Josie (as Minx): Talk you out of what? You didn’t give us a chance.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, you just left.
Minna (as Myra): So, let me walk you through my day. I go to meet up with somebody I’ve been friends with for longer than any of you, and who I see there is Ojal, and she has the bloody sleeve of his uniform with her, and she tells me this woman you have honestly been enemies with since the day you left has him and she’s probably going to kill him unless you come, I presume, alone to this warehouse, and I wasn’t going to let that happen so I went.
Josie (as Minx): I get that, just… I’m just saying, you knew we weren’t gonna stay away, not for a fucking letter. [chuckles]
Minna (as Myra): I hoped. I hoped you at least wouldn’t get yourselves killed over this, because he’s not your problem, he’s mine.
Josie (as Minx): We share a lot of problems, Myra. That’s kind of part of us being a crew.
Kim (as Blaire): If you really think that we wouldn’t die for you, then… I don’t know if you even know us.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t want you to die for me! I don’t want anybody to die for me!
Josie (as Minx): And we don’t want you to die alone in a blank cell somewhere. We’re in this for a reason, right?
Minna (as Myra): I just didn’t want to get you killed over my messes.
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t be stupid.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna move in to hug Myra.
Minna: Myra holds her tightly. She’s a lot more upset than she usually is, probably a lot more upset than you’ve seen her, because it’s been a lot.
Josie (as Minx): Myra, trust me, I really get it. I’m just really glad you’re okay.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re here to help you with your messes.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. I just didn’t- I’m so used to keeping- I have all these secrets that I’m used to keeping, and it’s a habit more than anything at this point.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Josie (as Minx): That’s okay. You didn’t do anything wrong, okay?
Kim (as Blaire): It’s okay if it’s a habit. Habits can be unlearned. It just takes some work.
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm…
Kim (as Blaire): Listen. We care about you, a lot, and you don’t have to keep anything from us. We’re not gonna think less of you or hold it over your head. We’re not Salia.
Minna (as Myra): Do you know how few people I’ve heard that from in my life? [smiling sob]
Josie (as Minx): I can only imagine.
Minna (as Myra): [tearful] I’m sorry. I should have known it would be different here.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s okay. You came from a rough place, and that’s gonna take a long time to shake off.
Josie: Minx is joining the group hug.
Minna (as Myra): How much… How much did you hear earlier?
Josie: Pretty much everything.
Minna (as Myra): You’re gonna have to define that for me, because I don’t know—
Josie (as Minx): We heard about your mother.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Why didn’t you tell us? I’m so sorry.
Josie (as Minx): I understand that one. I don’t think that’s something she needs to talk about until she’s absolutely ready.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah, no.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t talk about it. I have never talked about it.
Kim (as Blaire): But doesn’t that really hurt you?
Minna (as Myra): I think I just learned to swallow the hurt.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, no.
Minna (as Myra): There was no one to talk to before now, and I didn’t—How do you bring that up? When I was a kid my mom died in the sickness and she didn’t wanna go, so she used me instead, and… and I was almost gone, and this woman came along with a Whisper and she purged her, and it was all horrible and I remember every second of it, and then she held it over me for years, and it was the one secret that I didn’t want anybody to ever know. I guess it doesn’t matter now.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose I have one question. How does it feel having said that?
Minna (as Myra): It’s not as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
Kim (as Blaire): See?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think I… I think it’s been a long time since I thought you would think I was weak for knowing what happened.
Kim (as Blaire): No~ No, no.
Josie (as Minx): Of course not.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra… No. What you went through… What you went through would have broken a lot of people. You’re not broken.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I’m not, no thanks to Salia. [chuckles] Well, maybe a little thanks to Salia.
Josie (as Minx): We’re here for you.
Minna (as Myra): You have no idea how much that means. Okay, one last secret.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm?
Josie (as Minx): Hmm?
Minna (as Myra): The man I went to save tonight, he’s a Bluecoat.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Josie (as Minx): See why you might not have mentioned that.
Minna (as Myra): He wasn’t when I met him.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Minna (as Myra): He was a mark. He was at the Imperial college, and I was supposed to find, I was supposed to see if he knew stuff about this case that his dad was working—his dad’s a barrister—and we hit it off, and I didn’t have friends at that point, because you’ve seen Ojal and Wester and Clave I suppose by this point. Actually, I don’t know if you have, but they’re nightmares, honestly.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Minna (as Myra): And, I was lonely.
Kim (as Blaire): That… That’s okay. Listen, if he’s a friend of yours, he’s a friend of ours, and I’m sure he’s not too much of a bad guy, even if he is with the fuzz.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, he’s… I don’t know what to say about him. He was my best friend for a long time, and we don’t see eye-to-eye on a lot of things.
Kim (as Blaire): Good.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): [chuckles] He’s privileged, and kind of an asshole sometimes, but he’s I guess my asshole? I don’t know. It’s complicated. Anyway, I don’t know if it’s gonna last after this anyway. I mean, I honestly don’t know what he’s going to do or how he’s gonna survive this.
Kim (as Blaire): We can worry about that another time, okay?
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Why don’t you come sit down and we’ll make you some tea, and you can cuddle Hex, and sit by the fire, and…
Minna (as Myra): That would be so wonderful. You have no idea how tired I am.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, come here.
Minna: I think she kinda leans on Blaire a little.
Kim: Aghh~
Josie: Aww. [laughs]
Kim: So cute. That was out of character, that wasn’t Blaire.
Rhi: Blaire makes some tea and the three of you settle in on the couch to figure out what comes next, what you’re gonna continue doing, what you’re gonna continue fighting for, and what is worth the risk.

"Season 2 Wrap-Up and Q&A Transcript","The Magpies – Transcript
Season 2 Wrap-Up and Q&A
Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Hello listeners. As we did at the end of Season 1, we’re taking a bit of a breather between seasons with a Q&A episode. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions. They were a ton of fun to answer.
Two quick notes about the episode. First, there’s a point where we’re talking about entanglement rolls, but I keep calling them engagement rolls. My bad. Second, a quick content warning. I go off on a rambling discussion of Leverage for a bit, and in explaining the plot of the show there’s a brief mention of child death. I’ll include the timestamp in the show notes.
{Transcriber’s Note: Tags are placed before and after this content if you wish to skip over it.}
There will also be a handful of bloopers at the end of this episode, and our Patreon backers can hear the full blooper reel now. There’s also a public post on our Patreon with the Season 2 character and crew sheets, so if you’ve been wondering about the mechanics of how the Magpies work you can take a look at that.
I have a lot of announcements to cover so sit tight, it’s all exciting stuff.
First, the audio from the GenCon panel that I moderated, ‘So You Want to Start an Actual Play Podcast,’ is up. Thanks to The Redacted Files podcast for editing and hosting that recording, and thanks to Megan, Aser, Meghan, and Paulomi for being on the panel with me.
Second, September is International Podcast Month. Visit InternationalPodcastMonth.com to check out all the awesome episodes. I’m a player in the Good Society actual play one-shot, and I moderated a conversation about accessibility in tabletop RPGs. I’m really proud of both episodes, and they both go up later this week.
Speaking of accessibility, we have transcripts on MagpiesPodcast.net for all of Season 1! Thank you so much to Tyler and Lyra for all their hard work on transcribing the episodes. We’ll be starting on Season 2 very soon.
Next, those of you who follow our Twitter account may have seen that James Bricknow, one of our fans, created a 3D render of a Magpies pin. He was generous enough to not only send me some pins that he printed—more on that in a second—but he also gave me the files and instructions to setup a Shapeways store so that you can buy pins of your own. I was really hoping to have the store up and running for this episode, but there were some technical hiccups and it’s still being worked on. My goal is to have it up and running by the Season 3 opener at the absolute latest. Keep an eye on our Twitter for updates, and as soon as the store is open I will announce it in an intro.
James very generously mailed me a number of pins that he printed off. Most of the pins are going to Magpies, past and present, but I have five pins that will be part of a giveaway. When we reach 100 backers on Patreon I’ll randomly pick five current patrons to win a Magpies pin. So, if you’re thinking about backing us now is a great time.
In addition, Kim has just put the finishing touches on the annual postcard for backers who support us at $15 or more. It’s a great piece of art, and all of the postcards will have a hand-written message from me on them. If you’d like to get a postcard, back us at $15 or more and you’ll be on the list, and if you’re already backing us at that level, remember to fill out the form to get me your address.
As I mentioned last episode, we’re going to be taking a one month hiatus from new Magpies episodes so that I can catch up on editing, but we’ll be posting two bonus episodes during that time. The first bonus episode is one that I recorded quite some time ago with my good friend Paulomi who is also the host of the Iron Hides podcast. We played a reskinned version of a two-player game called A Scoundrel in the Deep and laid the groundwork for some future Magpies plots. The second bonus episode is a one-shot of Band of Blades, the latest Forged in the Dark game published by Evil hat. It’s a dark, military fantasy, and it was GMed by one of the game’s authors. We had a ton of fun playing this game and exploring a very different world from Blades.
Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Josie: On August 31, many peaceful counter-protesters standing against the white supremacist “straight pride parade,” big air quotes on that one, in Boston were assaulted by police, unprovoked, and wrongfully imprisoned. The Solidarity Against Hate Legal Defense Fund is an ongoing fundraiser to post bail for these brave individuals. Fortunately, the goal for bail was met within a few hours, but you can still help. All further proceeds will be split between donations to the Mass Bail Fund, a national organization that works to free people from incarceration and end money bail, and Boston GLASS, which provides all manner of vital services to queer trans people of color. Please donate to the fundraiser and/or directly to those groups. Thank you.
Rhi: There are a terrible number of crises happening in the world right now; the fires in the Amazon, continued gun violence, the concentration camps at our borders, attacks on civil liberties, devastation from hurricanes, and so much more. It can absolutely feel overwhelming, but there are always ways you can help. When you hear about a crisis, look for things you can do, organizations that are collecting donations or directing actions, and when you find something do what you can and share it with others. The constant litany of tragedy and horror can feel like standing in front of a fire hose, and it can be easy to despair when you feel helpless, but finding ways to help and contribute, even if they’re small, can push back against those feelings, and we need to keep pushing back.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
##
Rhi: Hi everybody, and welcome to our Season 2 Wrap-Up Q&A episode! I’m Rhi, as you probably know by this point, and we have a whole bunch of questions from our listeners that we are gonna go through and talk about. To start off, I’m gonna ask everybody to introduce themselves and share one of their favorite moments from this season.
Kim: Hi, I’m Kim. I play Blaire Culhane on the show, and one of my favorite moments from this season that was definitely memorable in my mind was when Blaire was testifying in the—
[laughter]
Minna: [whispering] Yes!
Kim: Being up on that podium and giving Blaire’s/the ghost’s testimony was just super, super fun. I really loved doing that.
Minna: So good.
Rhi: Yeah, that was really, really good.
Kim: The way it came out I thought it would be a stammering mess, but I think it came across as pretty hilarious, so I’m proud of that.
Rhi: It was, yeah.
Josie: Hi, I’m Josie. I play Minx. I think, man, there was a lot of really good character moments I loved this season, but I think one of my favorites is from the finale where Minx and Blaire were waiting under the grate while Myra and Salia had that whole big conversation that dumped all of Myra’s secrets and trauma out, because it was just like, oh no. [laughs] But it’s also like, finally.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I’m Minna. I play Myra. I’m gonna have to go for… Okay. First, just to let you know, out of character for weeks and weeks and weeks I feel like we had this somber menace of ‘something bad is coming.’ Rhi would roll something and mysteriously not tell us.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Anyway. The payoff, the night that it was revealed that Rigney had been selling us out to Salia was like—
Kim: Yes!
Josie: Mm-hmm!
Minna: –the most amazing payoff, because we had no idea what the fuck was going on.
Kim: We had NO idea.
Minna: It was, completely blindsided and heartbroken.
Kim: Our reactions were real-time in that moment.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Like, literally, I was like “wait, is THIS why you’ve been doing those rolls, mysteriously, that you wouldn’t tell us about?”
Rhi: I… I felt very powerful in that moment, not gonna lie.
Minna: It was very good.
Kim: It was some brilliant GMing.
Rhi: Thank you. I’m glad. It’s always a little bit of a gamble as a GM to keep a plot like that secret. I figured I knew all of you well enough to know how it would be received and how it would play out, but that was very, very satisfying to finally get to that reveal. That’s definitely one of my favorite moments from this season. Gosh, to pick an original favorite moment that’s not just copying Minna for myself… I think, honestly, there were a few times during our downtime vignettes where it was just all three of you talking, or just two of you talking, the season finale is one example, I think the end of that episode with the Rigney reveal where Blaire and Myra were talking, where I’m basically just sitting back and listening to the three of you just GO HARD into really, really good, emotional character stuff.
Kim: Aw.
Rhi: I love that. That’s great.
Kim: Even though I started crying out of character and you had to cut that?
Minna: Aww, buddy~
[laughter]
Rhi: But yeah, those moments where it’s just really, really good, deep character stuff where I can just sit back and listen to all of you go are great.
Kim: Yeah. I feel like that’s really been earned, because at this point we’ve all as a group built a comradery to allow us to play off each other like that, so the emotional moments, you know, the longer that we do this are just going to become all the more satisfying.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: All right. So, now we’re gonna dive into questions from our listeners. Some of these are from folks on Patreon, some of them are from Twitter.
Kim: Sup Twitter.
Rhi: Let’s get started. Our first question comes from Alice Tobin who is a Patreon backer, and the question is: Now that you’re all gaining trauma, how do you feel it’s changed the way you play your characters? I guess we could probably run through who has trauma and what traumas you have chosen. Myra has so far managed to avoid it.
Minna: We’ve tried our best.
Rhi: Despite my best efforts.
Minna: I even tried.
Josie: Minx, as of the finale, has two traumas, which are Reckless and Unstable.
Kim: And Blaire semi-recently acquired the trauma Paranoid, is what I selected for her.
Rhi: Yeah. I know that we’ve definitely seen how Reckless has showed up for Minx.
Josie: Yep. Well, the funny thing about that is, like, Minx is in some ways a very Josie character and in some ways not, and gaining Reckless kind of let me take the restraints off a little bit, drop my weighted training clothing [laughter] and just go whole-hog Josie character, I think.
Rhi: Yeah. Josie, I think you had made the comment that there are some trauma options that make it more likely that you’re going to gain additional trauma, like Reckless. You are probably going to be charging into situations where you’re gonna keep taking stress, which is exactly what happened in the season finale.
Josie: I feel like Reckless, and Obsessed, and Unstable are probably the ones most likely to accrue stress.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: And then Unstable, we saw a little bit of it in the finale, but what that actually entails will be for next season, so… It will be very apparent, but it hasn’t played out yet.
Rhi: And then for Blaire.
Kim: Yeah. I feel as though I’m still trying to figure out how to incorporate Blaire’s trauma mechanically, but since the way that I myself interact with systems as a player and the way that Blaire interacts in the story, she’s definitely more improv and character and story driven than she is mechanically driven, so that’s going to be a challenge for me to have her trauma pop up in mechanics as far as the game rules and whatnot. I am trying to play up her trait of Paranoid now character-wise, and I feel as though I’ve started peppering that in towards the later end of the season, but so far it hasn’t affected her mechanically yet.
Rhi: I think mostly you’ve had it pop up a few times where she has been very anxious about, again, this whole concept of the crew splitting up, of needing to know where people are, how are we gonna find you if something happens.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: And again, I think the season finale is just gonna fuel that fire.
Minna: Yeah, because that ended up being a good thing knowing where Myra was, because… [slanted] they found her.
Kim: See, the tough thing I feel is, though, when it comes to Paranoid and playing Blaire is that Blaire intrinsically is a very trusting character. She wants to see the good in others even if they’re demonstrably evil, or even ghosts, or demons, so it’s a very fine line that I have to walk when I think that I’m going to incorporate her trauma into a scene, because I have to be careful for myself to believe that okay, is what I’m playing this scene make sense for her, and does this make sense for her, and does this conflict with the character that I’ve already established.
Rhi: Yeah. The rules specifically say that, you know, you are free to play up, or not, your characters’ traumas as much or as little as you want.
Kim: Right, and I really do appreciate that, but for me I still have to figure out a way to make it work mechanically, is the big thing with Blaire.
Rhi: Makes sense. Before we get into the next question, Krysm Phoenix was one of a couple people who asked if we would be willing to share the character and crew sheets. This will be in the episode description and on Twitter and other such places, but I have posted screenshots of the end of Season 2 character sheets. It’s on Patreon, but it’s a publicly available post, so anybody can go see them. If you are curious about how those all look you can just head over there and see them. they should be up at the time this episode goes live.
So, the question from Krysm Phoenix that we’re actually going to discuss, is: I’m gonna steal this from Fate and the Fablemaidens – shout out to a fellow AP podcast – Who of the party would you take with you to an amusement park, a cruise ship, or a haunted house? You can only choose one person for each one, and if you take Blaire to the haunted house it has to be something that would actually unnerve her.
Kim: [laughs] Oh, good luck.
Minna: Here’s the thing, I really want to take Blaire to an amusement park now.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: That was going to be my answer!
Rhi: I feel like Blaire at an amusement park would just be the most joyous experience.
Josie: Yeah, that’s what I was thinking too.
Kim: It would. It would also work well because we’re both adrenaline junkies, so we would just have the time of our lives at an amusement park.
Minna: Aww.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yeah. I probably would take Minx on a cruise ship.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: But I don’t want to take Myra to a haunted house, because that might just be actually traumatizing.
Rhi: [withheld gasp]
Kim: Yeah. Myra would have a bad time.
Rhi: I feel like if it’s your standard issue Halloween haunted house type thing I feel like Myra would actually handle it pretty well, because she’s so calm.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, because Myra would be like “that’s fake, that’s fake.”
Rhi: Yeah, exactly! [laughs]
Minna: I feel like Minx, if you took Minx to a haunted house, she’d be the friend who’s like half hiding behind you and grabbing onto your arm.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: Yeah. Those pictures of people getting caught in jump scares.
[laughter]
Minna: Myra would be the one who doesn’t react at all.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Never mind. Minx goes into the haunted house, Myra gets to relax on a cruise.
Kim: Blaire would just be so… smiling.
Minna: Wait, sorry. Who’s relaxing on the cruise? Minx?
Josie: Myra.
Minna: Myra? Force Myra to relax, 2K19! [laughs]
Rhi: Minx gets dragged through the haunted house and jumps and screams at everything.
Josie: [frightened yelp]
Minna: Exactly!
Rhi: Oh man.
Minna: I think you’ve played that way before and it was very good.
Josie: Oh yeah, whenever any significant spoopy stuff happens.
Kim: You just let out the most adorable little yelps.
Josie: [stammers] How dare.
Kim: You do!
Minna: [sighs] Myra on a cruise ship, and I’m just now picturing her lying in a deck chair in like sunglasses and it’s such a weird fucking image.
Kim: A really big sunhat.
Minna: Yes!
Rhi: Mm-hmm, big umbrella over her, enormous book, just the biggest book.
Minna: Yes, the biggest book.
Rhi: Oh…
Kim: [singing] If you like piña coladas.
[laughter]
Rhi: All right. Our next question from Gus G, another Patreon backer, is mostly for me.
Kim: Thank you.
Rhi: I’d like to hear a little from Rhi about how you create NPCs on the fly. What do you think is most important to making an improvised NPC interesting? Do you use tables of names and traits from the Blades GM sheets or elsewhere? To answer that second question, yes. The list of names in the Blades in the Dark book is probably the most useful thing that has ever been printed in any game book ever. [others laugh] All game books should be required to include a list of names to help out GMs everywhere.
Josie: Like, an actually lengthy one, not like in D&D where it’s just like oh, here’s five tiefling names or whatever.
Rhi: Yeah, here’s five names that could be—Yeah.
Minna: There’s a D&D sourcebook that has an appendix that’s just lists of names, and it’s magical.
Rhi: [groans] God bless. Yeah, I mean, it’s been in the stingers and in the episodes of my ongoing difficulties with coming up with names for characters, so having that quick reference is really helpful for me. In terms of coming up with NPCs on the fly and how I make them interesting, I don’t know… [laughs] It’s not a super conscious process. I think at this point I kind of have a sense of what sort of people the group likes, and so I try to put those sort of people in their path, if it’s somebody that everyone is supposed to get along with. I think I also sometimes try to go for defying expectations a little bit. I think our crime grandma, Rose, is one of those where, you know, sweet old lady, knits, has a lot of cats, bakes cookies, definitely used to be a hitter for a gang, like she recreationally beat people up.
Josie: [laughs] Are you thinking she was the cutter?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. I’ve given some thought to Rose’s history, and yeah, she has some stories. Playing with those sorts of things. I think also, oh, who was the ghost…? Tira was another one where having a ghost who’s really kind of chill with being dead.
Kim: And super spacey.
Rhi: Yeah. A lot of times it’s just I try to latch onto either some quirk about their character or something about the voice or the way they’re presented that will make them a little more interesting and memorable. It’s usually not a very conscious process in my head, though, I just sort of wing it.
Minna: I know it was early on when you made Kay, but I still don’t quite believe that you didn’t think some people would latch onto her, because we had played with other people who immediately latch onto Kay types.
Rhi: [exhales] yeah…
Josie: Yeah. Like, you made her specifically to attack me and Kim.
Minna: Can match, right?
Kim: Yeah. You can’t just make a buff woman and expect us to not love her.
Rhi: Well, I distinctly remember with Kay—I don’t remember if this made it into the episode—but I initially started describing that character as a man.
Kim: Oh, did you?
Josie: Oh.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. I had been like, oh yeah, this tall, buff Gondolier, and then I think I said something like—I think I said he, and then I was like hmm, no, this will be more interesting if the tall, buff Gondolier with prison tatts is a woman! And then you all were like WE LOVE HER!
[laughter]
Josie: Yep. I think Kim just let out the most adorable sound.
Kim: Okay—Nn…
Josie: Revenge. Revenge, Kim.
Kim: Nn… Mm.
Rhi: [giggles]
Kim: Yeah, jus tangentially onto this question, I feel as though I have a bit of insight if you don’t mind me latching on.
Rhi: Oh yeah.
Kim: I feel as though all it takes to make an NPC, or any character, interesting is to find at least one trait, one defining characteristic, and then amplifying it and then just playing up on it, and it especially helps when you have a group of players who will also lift that trait up, because then it sticks in – in this case since we’re a podcast – it sticks in the audience’s mind. There is a defining trait about this character and it makes them memorable. I would say from an improv/acting/artist/writer viewpoint, which is where I’m coming from with this question, is that you know, NPCs may appear more accomplished based on that one factor, having a trait and amplifying it, and also depending on how often that character returns, and it becomes a recurring character, like Kay for example.
Rhi: Yeah. That continues to happen where I’ll introduce someone as a one-off and everyone’s like “uh, we love them, and they need to come back forever.”
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: It’s like, [exasperated] okay! So, our next question from @JH_official – I just realized I’ve once again damned myself to trying to pronounce people’s Twitter handles.
Minna: Next time ask them to give us a thing to call them.
Rhi: Yeah, I know. I never think to do that until I reach this moment of trying to pronounce Twitter handles. So, they ask: What inspired y’all to start playing Blades together, and what are some of the challenges of the format you use to tell stories?
Josie: As far as I know, it was all Rhi’s idea.
Kim: Yes.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. It was less that- This group came together for the purpose of the podcast, and it was me wanting to do a Blades AP and then recruiting people.
Josie: I literally filled out an application.
Minna: I had played a one-shot of Blades with Rhi and fell in love with the game from that, so that helped.
Josie: I think all of us had played in one-shots with each other on the one-shot Discord. I think I’d definitely done that with Minna before.
Minna: Maybe us two, yeah.
Rhi: I think pretty much everybody, including Madge in this, I had played in games with all of you. I don’t think that all of you had been in games with each other. For some of you this game was the first time that you’d met.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: It was probably Masks for me and you, right? It was definitely Masks.
Rhi: Yeah. We were in a Masks game. Minna and I are in a few games. Kim and I have been in a few games. Madge and I had been in some other games. Yeah, this group came together specifically for The Magpies.
Kim: Yeah. This was my first time playing Blades. I had no experience at all before the podcast, so this entire show has been a learning experience for me.
Josie: Same.
Kim: I’d never played a one-shot or even looked at the rules. I still kind of don’t.
[laughter]
Rhi: Listen. Every AP needs a Johnny. It’s fine.
Minna: Uh-huh.
Kim: Well, my point being is that, you know, this game was my first experience meeting Josie and Minna. I have known Rhi for a number of years before the podcast, and I knew Madge from Twitter but we’d never done a game before, so yeah, this whole experience recording the podcast is really, I feel almost come full circle to me, because I’ve gotten so close to all of you.
Minna: Mm-hmm~
Rhi: Yeah~
Josie: Yeah. I think the real answer to this question is… Rhi, I don’t think you’ve ever really talked about why you started this.
Rhi: I think I’ve talked about this a little bit in a post that I did for the Magpies Quill on Patreon, but I literally- Blades in the Dark was on Kickstarter, I saw a post either on Twitter or Tumblr about it, I went and looked and I was like hmm, this looks like a cool game. I backed it, I started reading over the playtest materials, and most games that I look at I usually start thinking about the kind of character that I could create. Blades was the first game that I picked up and I was like oh, I wanna GM this.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I got to run it a few times, like I did some one-shots, I played it a little bit in person with my friend group here in Chicago, and by virtue of listening to One Shot and Campaign I started thinking doing my own AP podcast would be kinda cool, and to the best of my knowledge, and as far as I know this is still true, when we launched there wasn’t anyone doing a long form Blades in the Dark AP. Shows that do one-shots of different systems have done Blades. It’s pretty popular for streaming, there’s a lot of streamed campaigns of Blades, but not any other campaigns as a podcast, so part of it was I really, really, really love the system and I wanted to tell the kind of stories that it sets us up to tell, but also I saw a niche that nobody had filled and I figured if we’re first into that spot… I feel like it’s probably easier to get listeners, this is gonna sound really self-serving, but it’s gonna be easier to get listeners as a Blades in the Dark podcast because…
Kim: No one else has done it.
Rhi: …there’s only one of us right now, as opposed to starting another D&D podcast. Not to say that there’s anything wrong with starting another D&D podcast, if that is what you love, go for it, but you’re gonna have a lot more direct competition in that space.
Kim: One thing I think that must be really satisfying for you, Rhi, is whenever we get iTunes reviews that mention, you know, “I was trying to think of running Blades in the Dark at home and I had no idea how to run the system—“
Rhi: Oh God! It’s the best!
Kim: “—but this podcast gave me an idea of what the setting could look like.” I think that must feel really good for you.
Rhi: Yeah. Having people say that they learned how to play the game or run the game from listening to our show is awesome. Not at all what I expected.
Kim: Yeah, but it is high praise. I think that’s very flattering.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s great. Yeah, because I like… I really love this system, obviously, I’ve been running it for two and a half years? Yeah.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: More than that, we’re coming up on our… No. yeah? When did we start? Yeah, we’re coming up on two years.
Minna: We started recording September of 2016?
Rhi: 2017, yeah.
Minna: –17, sorry.
Rhi: Because we launched in February of 2018, so yeah, we’re coming up on two years of doing this game.
Kim: Wow.
Minna: I just know we did our first recording on September 11 of that year, I think, at least the weekend of September 11, because that’s when Irma happened.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Oh yes, that’s right.
Josie: Oh right, hurricane party.
Rhi: Our hurricane party.
Minna: Yeah, that’s why our first episode is unsalvageable.
Kim: Right.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Okay, so the other half of this question: What are some of the challenges of the format you use to tell stories? I’m not sure if this means the game or podcasting.
Josie: I read it as podcasting.
Rhi: All right, yeah. We just talked about the game system a whole bunch, let’s talk about podcasting.
Josie: Honestly, I really like podcasting a lot, but it is a hit not having apparent body language to refer to.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: I do like it to some degree because it encourages us to be more descriptive and spell things out more, which is something I like about podcasting, but was definitely harder to get to know the players and the characters without that touchstone.
Rhi: Yeah. This might be a little bit more of a game mechanics thing than a podcast thing, but one thing I struggle with as a GM is the nature of Blades is that the players go out into the world and immediately start generating plot hooks and problems and things, and one challenge I have is making sure that I don’t leave important threads dangling for too long or that I find ways to weave them back in, because there’s so much that’s going on and sometimes it can be hard to come back to those things and fit them back in a way that makes sense and feels satisfying. At this point, I do not use the engagement roll in downtime anymore. I don’t need to generate more problems for this group. [laughter] You all take care of that enough on your own. You have enough things going on that I just, I don’t bother with it anymore. I skip right over that part of downtime, because if I was also piling that stuff on top of all of the other fires—
Kim: It would be too much.
Rhi: Yeah. There’s no way that we could cover everything. The engagement rolls are great for the start of a campaign when you sort of need to get the ball rolling, but before too long there’s enough things on fire that you don’t have to set any yourself.
Kim: One thing that I know is a chronic problem for me as a person and a player is that if you let me I would just keep going on bit after bit after bit and meme after meme after meme, because that’s just how I kind of interact in roleplay settings. When I’m not playing a super sad, dramatic character I like to kind of be the comedy relief, because I feel as though it’s very easy and also very popular to play a character with a lot of trauma and a lot of backstory, and I’ve done that as well, and I enjoy that.
Rhi: Listen, don’t attack me like this, Kim. [laughs]
Kim: No, I’m not calling anybody out at all, because I have this problem as well. You know in a past campaign I played a character with a lot of issues, and I enjoy the drama, but at the same time I also find a lot of value in bringing light and levity and humor to the table.
Minna: Yeah~
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: So, one problem, since this is a curated show for the public, is that so much gets cut out, and I feel as though if Rhi doesn’t tell me to shut the fuck up that I will just keep going.
[laughter]
Rhi: I do it lovingly.
Kim: I know you do it lovingly, but I don’t think you guys understand how much cut content there is.
Minna: The cut Jurassic Park joke still hurts me.
Rhi: I’m almost certain that the Jurassic Park joke is in the blooper reel.
Minna: Oh, I’m sure, I’m sure.
Kim: It is in the Season 1 blooper reel.
Minna: It was just so beautiful in context, too.
Kim: [laughs] Yeah.
Rhi: I think part of that also is a little bit of the fact that we’re playing remotely. The fact that remote games is a thing that can happen is awesome. It’s the only reason that I am as active in the hobby as I am…
Kim: Yeah, me too.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: …because my in-person group in Chicago, we didn’t play games for like five, six years, and we just started playing again, and we can only get together once a month.
Kim: Oof.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: [laughs] It’s rough. So like, the fact that we can play online is awesome, but it can also be tough, I think like Josie said, of not having the visual feedback of a lot of the jokes and bits that tend to come up. Yeah, there are some challenges, but I also like the fact that I can, you know, playing online, I don’t have to put on shoes and go anywhere. I can just sit at my desk with my delicious cider and chill out.
Josie: Yeah. Although–
Kim: Yeah. I can be in pajamas and wear no bra and it’s fine.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. You were saying, Josie?
Minna: I mean, I don’t think any of us would care if the others weren’t wearing a bra. [laughs]
Kim: No, not in this group, but still.
Rhi: Fair.
Josie: I’ve recorded almost every episode of Magpies in some form of undress.
[laughter]
Rhi: Listen, we just wanna be comfy.
Kim: Yes.
Josie: Yeah. But I just wanted to say that, Kim, we really appreciate your memes.
Minna: Yes, I love them.
Josie: And also I think it’s important that the viewers know that we have a channel in our Discord called Kim’s Meme Emporium where memes are shared.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: We just need a dedicated space to put my trash fires, because otherwise if I put it in general chat Rhi yells at me. So, that’s why that exists.
Rhi: [giggles] It’s a containment unit.
Minna: I mean, also, most servers I’m in have a meme channel, it’s just that this one is named after you.
Kim: Due to who I am as a person. Anyway.
Minna: It’s beautiful.
Rhi: And we love who you are as a person very much.
Minna: Yes.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: So, our next question from @WildPark: How have you maintained the energy and commitment to the game over two long and very welcomed seasons? Many AP podcasts seem to burn out after the first flush of enthusiasm wanes.
Josie: For me, it only gets easier with time, really.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: The hardest part of recording magpies was those first few months before the show started getting released, because part of it is we weren’t getting feedback, right, because we were recording ahead and it wasn’t going out into the world.
Kim: We weren’t getting feedback, and also we were still trying to learn each other as players and as people.
Josie: Right. That was, I’m not gonna lie, it was really hard on me starting out. Part of that is just because I was in a worse place in life, it was a bit of an adjustment, but now it’s just sort of like, I love you all and doing this is really easy, because I can just show up with people I care about, and Minx is really easy to slip into now. Really, it’s that first hump of starting anything creative, there’s like a cresting point where it stops being an uphill climb and into a habit basically.
Rhi: Yeah, exactly.
Minna: Yeah. I think any game there’s a getting to know you period, both for the people – well, with our group – but even people you know, the characters, figuring out how they fit together, that’s always the hardest part of a game for me.
Kim: One thing that is really exciting for me is that over the course of this one and a half, almost two years, is that the more that I play Blaire the more that I learn about her, and as a player that is so exciting for me. It’s also rewarding because I set out Blaire’s story to be a coming of age story, so the fact that her character arc is paying off for me in that way is super satisfying. When I first started playing her, because I’m an artist and I’m a visual thinker, I had no idea what she looked like and that was super hard for me, because whenever I start a new campaign one thing that I like to figure out first along with the character sheet and the name, etcetera, etcetera, is the character design, because that informs the way that I play a character. Now after the fact that we are so long into this campaign now, and I know how Blaire interacts with the world, how she talks and behaves and thinks, that is really fun for me, and her character is very slowly evolving and changing into something slightly bigger than what I originally envisioned, and that’s just so fun for me as a player. I am eternally grateful to have this group to allow me to explore the themes that I am, and I am just so proud of how far Blaire has already come already.
Rhi: Yeah. This was something I didn’t touch on when Josie was asking why I started it, another part of why I started this show is because around the time when I was starting it I was just feeling really stuck in a rut creatively. I wasn’t really writing as much, I didn’t really have a lot going on, I was just kind of coming home from work and making dinner and then just zoning out. I couldn’t tell you what I did with my evenings for hours, and I was like, I need some kind of creative project to fill my time. I had a little experience with audio editing, and I knew that it will fill the time.
Kim: Oh yeah.
Rhi: It fills so much time. I think that’s part of why I have stuck with it, because this is something that is very creatively fulfilling for me, not just playing the games but creating the episodes.
Kim: And just maintaining the community and the Patreon and everything.
Rhi: Yeah! It’s a lot of work, and I am not perhaps as good at delegating as I should be, but I do, I very much appreciate all the help that I get from all of you, particularly with the Patreon. But yeah, this is kind of my major creative endeavor right now, and I think that is what’s really motivating for me.
Next question, another Twitter handle, @DrkGuardian, without an A in dark: What was the hardest moment for you all out of character and in character? A hard decision, heavy emotions, etcetera.
Josie: The Nyryx reveal.
Rhi: Yeah…
Josie: Sorry, it’s far and away that.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, I think… yeah.
Josie: Because it was such a long time coming, because it’s a quirk of the character sheets we noticed so long ago, very close to the beginning of the campaign.
Minna: it was like Episode 2 or 3 of the published episodes, I think.
Josie: Yeah, so that was kind of known and sat on and negotiated, and Rhi did a lot of planning on how to figure it out and how to reveal it when, and then when we knew it was gonna happen there was, wow, there’s actually a lot of implications and emotions here that we have to work through and negotiate and double back on.
Rhi: Yeah, and that all still has not been settled. I imagine there’s gonna be throughout Season 3 a lot more conversations.
Josie: Right. In character especially it hasn’t been explored yet, but I do think the hardest part has passed on that, and then just actually roleplaying it was like… oh God, this is really serious. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: We had to have some out of character discussions once it finally came up and we figured out the implications.
Josie: Minx was not made to be this serious of a character, in the same way that Blaire has changed, Minx has kind of changed a bit too.
Rhi: Yeah. How about Blaire? Well, we’re not in character right now. Kim? Minna? What do you all have?
Kim: Eh, Blaire, Kim, interchangeable. I don’t care. Y’all always joke that Blaire’s not a character and I’m just leaning into it. So, one thing that definitely sticks out to me as being the hardest moment for me out of character, I think it was the Rigney reveal episode during downtime. Myra and Blaire’s conversation. I know I’ve already touched on this a little, but that was the first time during this game, at the table, where I cried out of character, and most of that was cut. You could hear it come through in the voice acting, but after that scene wrapped up I did have to mute myself on Discord because I started crying out of character, and that was… I forget what you said, Minna, but it was something along the lines, after I said feeling small or something like that—
Minna: I think it was I’m proud of you, maybe? I don’t know if it was the proud thing or something else.
Kim: I don’t think it was I’m proud of you, it was something about losing people and losing friends.
Rhi: Aww.
Kim: That is always a subject that pulls at my heartstrings a certain way, because that’s something that’s affected me a lot in life. So, after that scene wrapped up, I had to mute myself on Discord and just cover my mouth and try to get ahold of myself, and you guys all being the wonderful people that you are were checking in, oh my God, Kim, are you okay, are you okay, and I… the other part of me was also so embarrassed because I—
Rhi: Aww.
Kim: I have such a hard time expressing emotions in front of people, even friends, so having that happen at the table was very scary for me in the moment, but the fact that everyone was thinking of my emotional safety afterwards and checking in with me multiple times, that I was actually okay, actually did make me feel better after the feeling had passed. So, that was definitely the hardest thing for me out of character this season, was allowing that little bit of vulnerability, you know, happen in front of all of you.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Aw.
Kim: Because I had never experienced anything like that at the table before. I’ve done fake in character acting and fake character crying, but that was the first time when something very raw and real hit me, like completely blindsided me, and that was a little scary for me.
Rhi: Oh, well I’m glad that you felt okay with it afterwards, because that was definitely something we wanted to… I mean, we’ve had a few moments like that where we’ve had to pause and be like, okay, this thing is happening now, how are we all doing. Are we feeling okay? How do we want to proceed with this?
Kim: Yeah, but that was the first time when in character and out of character started mingling just a bit for me, just enough for me where checking in felt warranted.
Rhi: Yeah. Gotta love that bleed.
Kim: Woo!
Rhi: Minna, do you have anything in or out of character?
Minna: I’m not gonna lie, I’m gonna bounce off of Kim. Kim, you said something about how you’re a very private person and have trouble expressing emotions. I am also like this, and Myra is also like this. This is one of the traits she shares with me. I don’t know why, but Myra’s one of the intentionally closest to me characters I’ve built. Myra’s had to reveal a lot and have a lot of emotions and talk about those emotions with her friends this season, and that’s—
Kim: Myra said fuck!
[laughter]
Minna: When did Myra–? It was a while back that Myra said fuck.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: But it was Season 2.
Minna: But she did say fuck. I think it was with Jeren?
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: Yes. But yeah, so that Salia episode, even the scene that Kim was talking about, every time that I’ve had to have a quiet, Myra deals with her emotions and talks about them with her friends, it’s like I so much want to reveal things and have her be vulnerable, but it’s so tough to play her vulnerable, both because I’m not good at being vulnerable as a person and also Myra’s not good at being vulnerable as a person, so that’s been a bit of a struggle to try and push that out.
Rhi: Yeah. What Minna and I had talked about was how are we gonna reveal these big secrets that Myra has, and it was like, she’s not gonna tell them, they have to be expressed in a different way.
Minna: And like, there’s a part of me that almost feels unsatisfied like I wasn’t able to let her be as vulnerable as I wanted it to be, but also I think it makes sense for her that she struggles with that.
Rhi: Yeah. I would say for me, in character moments, Rigney, the conversation that he had with all of you after you found out that he had been selling you out for half a season. That was something that I had planned, I had notes for some of his dialogue there, but it was still like, you know, Rigney’s one of my favorite NPCs in this game. I have a lot of, there’s some deep Rigney lore living in my head. [laughs]
Kim: I want it.
Minna: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Well, you know, you gotta kind of patch things up with him a bit.
Minna: We didn’t know Rigney had a brother until then either.
Kim: Right!
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. [sighs] Gotta get Nevan back in the city at some point. But yeah, just that scene of… it was something that had been kind of lurking, as we mentioned earlier, that had been lurking in the background of all of his interactions with the crew for such a long time, and in a way it was sort of a cathartic moment for the character to finally be able to express all of this, but also having to tell people that you care about very much that you have been betraying them for the last few months is not a good time, so that was a pretty rough episode and scene, even as I was kind of out of character taking some glee at everyone’s very shocked reactions.
Minna: I will say his despair came right the fuck through.
Rhi: Yeah. That was what I was aiming for. Poor guy.
Minna: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Next question, from @IamKJ: Thank you so much for such an amazing show. Thank you for being such an amazing listener. Are there any plans to add a fourth cast member? I love the team chemistry as is, but it would be fascinating to see how a new teammate might integrate.
Kim: Mm. That was a conversation—
Rhi: We’ve talked about this.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. We’ve talked about this a bit.
Kim: As soon as we learned that Madge was walking away from the show, that was a conversation that we had almost immediately, was are we going to add a fourth cast member, and we’re definitely not opposed to the idea, I would say, but we’re also very comfortable with the dynamic that we already have.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I would say at this point that I am opposed, like, at least for the show as is. I don’t think it would work to bring in someone this late. If Madge had left a little earlier and we had decided to do it right at that time it might have worked out.
Kim: Maybe, yeah.
Josie: But I think at this point, just like, what we got works, and honestly I don’t think it would be super fun for a new person coming in…
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s kind of—
Josie: …because we have this dynamic established and it will take a good long while for them to integrate.
Kim: I have to agree.
Rhi: We do have plans for some guest characters. We’re gonna bring Seeks back in Season 3, which I’m personally very excited about, because Seeks is awesome.
Minna: Yes. I love Seeks.
Kim: Yes. Seeks is the best.
Rhi: And Waffles is also one of the best.
Minna: I want Kim to actually be there this time. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Kim: Yeah. The bonus episode was good, but the crew plus Seeks would be very satisfying.
Rhi: But yeah, I think at this point, probably not is kind of the direction that we’re leaning for bringing in a new cast member, but I do want to- something I wanted to do in Season 2 that didn’t really happen was bring in more guest players. I’m hoping there will be opportunities to do that in Season 3. Scheduling can be tough for that sort of thing, finding people to bring in can be tough, but I think that having an additional person in the mix for a single score is fun, but I think Josie is right that at this point both in and out of character we’ve just got a pretty solid group dynamic, and I feel like it might be tough to bring another person into that in a way that doesn’t end up making somebody feel awkward.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Our next question, from Thomas Seymour Turner, another Patreon backer: So you’ve had a session with a festival, but is there any one event that all of the Magpies would want to do together during their downtime or any other festival they might be interested in celebrating?
Minna: Hurriedly googles other festivals. Well, not googles, opens the book.
Rhi: I know, I’m looking at that too. I know there’s some other holidays that happen, I just…
Josie: I think Minx wants to drag the other two to the theater.
Rhi: Oh gosh…
Kim: Ohh…! [dramatically] The theater!
Minna: Oh! Ohh~! That would be so good.
Josie: [laughs] Perhaps an opera~
Rhi: Oh my God!
Minna: Agh~
Rhi: That would be amazing.
Kim: [opera singing] Funny makes me laugh~
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh no. God, The Phantom of the Opera is an actual ghost. Um…
Josie: I think we just figured out a Season 3 episode.
Rhi: Oh man. All right. I’ll put it on the list.
Kim: You guys can enable me, because I am a soprano 1 bitch, I’m sorry, but I don’t know harmonies. I was never taught.
Rhi: [laughs] So other holidays include Arkenvorn which honors the Spirit Wardens—
Minna: Fuck that. [laughs]
Rhi: –which I don’t feel like this group would celebrate.
Josie: Nope.
Rhi: Unison, which celebrates the end of the Unity War with Skovlan.
Minna: Or curses it, if you don’t agree with the Unity War.
Rhi: Yeah. That is kind of an element of the setting that we’ve not really engaged with very much, is sort of the whole Skovlan thing.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Which there’s so much in this setting, we cannot touch on all of it. Doskvorn we did a whole episode on. Gratitude, honoring the Immortal Emperor’s ascension to the throne and salvation of The Shattered Isles.
Kim: Nope!
Josie: Bleh.
Minna: That’s one thing we’ve never done, though! We’ve never done a Thanksgiving episode. [laughs]
Rhi: That’s basically what this is. Gratitude is basically, it also says, as well as celebrating thankfulness for other things in life. It is basically a Thanksgiving type holiday.
Kim: Oh. You know what, I could see a Magpies Thanksgiving in The Nest. That would be cute.
Rhi: Yeah. Aw, that would be fun.
Minna: Oh, can you imagine like a community Thanksgiving celebration though? Like setup in The Hound’s Paw?
Rhi: Oh, yeah. Aww.
Minna: Everyone cooks and brings pot luck shit.
Kim: That would be very cute. I actually like that.
Rhi: Aw, that would be real good. Yeah.
Minna: Would also be a good way to check in with some NPCs we hadn’t seen in a while.
Rhi: Yes. Hang on, I’m gonna write this down. [laughs]
Josie: Speaking of untouched on things in the setting, the thing about The Hound’s Paw is that it’s essentially a sports bar for the nearby dog races.
Kim: [gasps]
Minna: [squeaks] Yes! We’ve never been to the dog races!
Josie: We haven’t acknowledged that at all.
Rhi: [laughing] No, we described it in the first episode of it being the cutest sports bar—Yeah.
Kim: We need to go to a dog race.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yeah, for real.
Rhi: Oh no…
Minna: Do people wear fancy hats at the dog races?
Kim: Of course!
Rhi: Yes, they do, yeah.
Minna: Is it like horse races in our world?
Rhi: I’m gonna say yes. I’m literally writing these things down, by the way.
Kim: No, go on.
Rhi: Because these are very good ideas. Yeah, we have not made reference to the fact that Rigney runs a sports bar… ever.
Kim: Since Episode 1, yeah, no it hasn’t come up.
Rhi: Yeah, Episode 1 we described it and then we never talked about it again. Yeah, well, now we have some ideas for stuff to do next season. The Thanksgiving one would be really cute.
Kim: It would.
Rhi: It would be very fun. I don’t know what… Yeah, just a big pile of food episode is always good.
Kim: And dogs.
Rhi: Because I love describing food in this setting~
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: It’s very good.
Kim: It’s a challenge, but it’s good.
Rhi: Yeah. All right, so the next question that we’re gonna do is from @Snarkophagus:
Josie: Great name, by the way.
Rhi: Yes. How long would the Leverage crew survive in your Duskwall? I would like to share, in the interest of full disclosure, that I started hyperventilating with excitement upon being asked this question.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, first, if we are assuming that this is basically a Blades in the Dark AU of Leverage, the characters would be… Nate is obviously the Spider, Sophie is a Slide, Parker is a Lurk, Eliot is a Cutter. Hardison is a little tougher, but I feel like Leech is the best fit for him as a hacker, I feel like the Leech being sort of the tinkerer and saboteur that’s the closest analog. They would obviously be a team of vigilantes. I feel like they would do pretty well. If we are assuming a direct mapping of the story into Duskwall, the reason that the Leverage crew is as successful as they are in the show is because in Episode 1 they become just disgustingly wealthy, they pull off a really, really good score and become very rich, so they then have a ton of resources to do all of their vigilante vengeance for the common people. So, I feel like in terms of doing what they do, they would do pretty well.
In terms of personal growth? It might be a little harder, because like, this is a somewhat bleaker setting than the real world, or the version of the real world that they inhabit in Leverage. The existence of ghosts would probably be very difficult for some characters to deal with. Oh God, Eliot having to deal with ghosts… Yeah, that would be a real problem for him.
Minna: Does Eliot kill people? Is that why?
Rhi: Eliot… So, I’ll also mention, in the interest of full disclosure, I’m the only person on the cast who has seen Leverage.
[laughter]
Josie: Aside from one episode.
Minna: We saw one episode together.
Rhi: Yeah. I made all of them watch one episode.
Kim: I’ve still never seen it.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s right, because Kim wasn’t there. Well, I’ll have to- We’ll watch that at some point, maybe when I’m in Boston.
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, so Eliot, they don’t really get into specifics of what his background is, but prior to getting into his… He’s described as a retrieval specialist, which is he is sent into dangerous situations to acquire a thing or a person, but prior to that he was in the military? In some black ops type situation?
Kim: Oh fuck.
Minna: [gasps] Oh honey.
Rhi: There’s a lot of implications that he did some very, very—and then after he got out of the military, working for some different criminals, that he has done some extremely bad shit.
Minna: He totally was in the Unity War.
## Content Warning: discussion of child death [0:57:50] Skip to next tag
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I think he would have a lot of- He’d have a lot of issues with ghosts. Nate would have issues with one particular ghost. Nate’s kind of driving motivation in the show, at least to start off, is that his son—I don’t remember if it was cancer or if it was just some kind of rare disease—but his son got very sick and the insurance company that he worked for refused to cover procedures that could have saved him, so he died. So he would have one particular ghost haunting him, literally or metaphorically.
## End of Content Warning [0:58:30]
Rhi: Sophie would do amazing. Sophie’s just amazing. Parker would also I think do pretty good. But yeah, in short, I think that they would do pretty well. I think they would continue to be able to, you know, enact vigilante justice on Duskwall, but I think that on a personal level they would have a lot more problems than they do in the actual show, which is saying something, because they have a lot of problems in the actual show, but the beauty of watching it over those five seasons is how they come together as a beautiful found family and they help each other grow and become better people and everyone should watch Leverage, it is one of the best shows ever.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I love it so much.
Josie: Wow, you really rattled that off, huh?
Rhi: Listen.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: No, but that’s okay!
Rhi: I saw that question a few days ago and I have been thinking about it ever since. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah. No, that wasn’t a bad thing, I was saying that was impressive.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: All right. I think for our final question here, this is sort of an unapologetic ego stroking for us, we’re gonna go back to Alice Tobin, one of our Patreon backers, who asks: Are you aware of how wonderful and important your show is, and are the Magpies aware of how wonderful and important they are in Duskwall? UHH.
[laughter and embarrassed groaning]
Rhi: Let’s talk about that second one.
Kim: Yeah, let’s start with the second one.
Josie: Obviously Minx is very aware of how wonderful and important she is, but—[laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: I think Blaire is oblivious. I don’t think she knows how wonderful she is to the group or to Duskwall as a whole.
Minna: Augh… We told you!
Kim: I think she has no clue.
Minna: I told you directly!
Kim: I know this, but… Blaire has also—
Minna: Also, I’ve told you directly, so I guess that makes sense. [laughs]
Kim: Yes, but also, I’m pretty sure Blaire has forgotten, like almost immediately.
Minna: Aww.
Rhi: Well, it’s that thing where compliments just don’t sink in.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Yes, and this is another example of how Blaire is like me where Blaire has very little problems, or I should say less problems with receiving compliments than Kim does. I have such a hard time with compliments.
Rhi: I mean, I think we all do. Did you hear the noises we all made at the first half of that question?
[giggling]
Kim: Yeah, I know. The way in which I cope with how the show has been received is that, and this is gonna sound awful, but I don’t think about it. It’s much easier for me to deal with us doing this when it’s compartmentalized and it’s only a thing that we do every other Saturday, and it’s recorded, and then I try not to think about it throughout the rest of the week, because when I see the Twitter interactions and the fact that people even throw money at us every month, like that…
Rhi: That’s wild.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: That’s mindboggling.
Kim: Yeah. I do my best not to think about it, because if I do then I won’t know what to do with myself.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Honestly? Answering the question of am I aware, honestly no, simply because I have no idea how to interface with the fan base at all. Like, so far very few people in my friend circles listen, and I get @’d sometimes on Twitter, and that makes me very, very happy, but otherwise I don’t know how to be in contact with the fans at all. [laughs] So Rhi just kind of updates, and I’m like wow, that many people are listening, geez.
Kim: Yeah. Whenever Rhi sends us listener diagnostics and tells us about new reviews and whatnot, I look at it maybe once and I’m like, cool, and then I completely forget about it, because if I think about it or too long it really does fuck with my head.
Minna: I’m not gonna lie, I’m different on both counts of not really paying attention to it and not knowing people who are into it, because… uh, my dumb thing that I do is I occasionally check that tag, and when I say occasionally I mean it’s one of my habitual fidgets on Twitter, is I occasionally check the @ mention of Magpies.
Rhi: Yeah. Minna’s better about that than I am. [laughs]
Minna: Especially since Twitter changed its interface, I noticed you’ve had a lot more trouble with it.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah, I kinda keep track of that, because that’s fun. Sometimes people say fun things. Also, I’ve had a number of friends who’ve listened to at least some of it and dragged me over some aspects of it. [others laugh] It was Ammourazz who was like, what, you being really into found families, what?! Or something like that, related to that. [laughs] It’s not necessarily like, I don’t know if they’re fans or if they’re just listening to it, but I know and I’ve talked to a decent amount of people who have heard at least some of the show.
Rhi: Yeah, so as the person who kind of runs the social media and is sort of the face of the show, I have to interact with it, and I’m not saying that it’s a bad thing or it’s a chore, it is… uh, bewildering in some ways, and just really, really touching. From things of just like, you know, the tweets of people being like “oh, you should listen to The magpies.” God, somebody compared us to The Watch in Discworld recently. Like, what?! [laughs]
Minna: It was me having a Discworld meltdown, by the way, I just wanna point that out, which is the only reason I tweeted about it.
Rhi: Yeah, and we’ve gotten, you know, people have left us these incredibly kind and beautiful reviews, and some emails that we’ve gotten… Somebody wrote a song for us? Like an instrumental piece, and they had asked that it not be shared so I am respecting that, I am not sharing it, but someone was—I have been writing fanfic since I was like 11 or 12, so I have an understanding of the amount of love that you need to have for a series or some kind of media property, some kind of creation, to make something like that. You know? So, the fact that people have done that stuff, like we’ve had fan art, we’ve had somebody make music… that is, it is one of the most flattering and meaningful things for people to be saying that.
I will also say, as much as I love the reviews talking about how people have learned how to play Blades in the Dark or reviews saying that we’re all awesome as players and GM, I will admit I like hearing that, that makes me feel good.
Josie: Me too.
Rhi: I think the comments that I like the best are the ones that specifically call out our social justice bent and approach to both story and our sort of mission as a podcast. That was admittedly something I was a little nervous about, particularly the Featured Charity.
Kim: Because it can be polarizing in this day and age.
Rhi: Yeah, and I mean, just the RPG community is not always the friendliest to that sort of thing. So like, I was a little worried about how that was gonna be received, and it has been overwhelmingly positive of people specifically mentioning that as something that they like about the show has felt really, really good, and even if people were pissed about it I would keep doing it, but it makes… It’s really, really nice to know that we’ve got this audience that is so supportive of not just the story that we’re telling but of what we are trying to do.
Kim: In the real world.
Rhi: In a small way. Yeah. That’s really, really gratifying. Yeah… Compliments are hard, but they’re very much appreciated, and it really does mean the—
Kim: We may have a hard time expressing it in words, because we’re all disasters in our own ways, but the fact that more than 10 people listen to this at all is I think fair to say mindboggling to all of us, and we thank you.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. All of the support that we get, people tweeting at us, leaving reviews, the people who donate who back us on Patreon, all of it is fantastic and we love it, and whenever something new comes up and I share it in the Discord there’s just a lot of screaming and flailing about like “oh my God, I can’t believe that person said that, that’s so nice, and we love them.”
Kim: Yeah, we love you.
Rhi: Yeah. I was gonna say, that’s pretty much the note we’re gonna end this on. That’s all the questions that we have to cover. I know that there were some other questions that got submitted that we didn’t get to answer, but we wanna keep this from being a three-hour ramble session.
Kim: Yeah, keeping it short and sweet tonight.
Rhi: Yes. So, as always, as we said, thank you all so much for listening…
Kim: Mwah!
Rhi: …for all of your support, and we are looking forward to starting Season 3 with all of you.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Kim: Yeah!
Rhi: yeah!
Josie: yay!
Rhi: All right—
ALL: Bye~
## Bloopers [1:08:24]
Rhi: There’s one of those—[distant meowing] …cats screaming at me.
Minna: [giggles]
Kim: [angry cat noise]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Harley~ Why are you yelling?
Kim: She do a scream.
Rhi: [sweetly] Please stop yelling while I am setting the scene. Thank you.
—
Minna (as Myra): So, we’re obviously gonna roll up to their shop and talk to them—
Minna: No. That’s not what she would say. Roll up is not a good phrase for Blades in the Dark.
[laughter]
Kim: Fruit roll up!
—
Minna: Should I toss a Magpie pin in?
Rhi: I mean, I think you should.
Minna: Well, you’re the GM. I’m asking my fellow Magpies. [laughs] Is this too messy to be worth attaching our name to?
Kim: It’s very messy.
Rhi: [whispering] Do it~
Josie: Yeah, let’s not.
Kim: It’s too messy.
Rhi: [whispering] Do iiit~
Minna: Yeah, and we don’t want people to know that we—
Kim: I’m willfully ignoring the DM.
Rhi: [whispering] Do iiit~
Josie: Yeah, we should—
Minna: I think we don’t want people to know that we have access to these locks given that we don’t want to spoil our plans.
Rhi: That’s fair.
Kim: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Josie: I think we want to drop the pin for the Ironhook thing, because then it’s like, oh, we’re badass, we got in and out, but…
Madge: Not right now.
Minna: yeah.
Josie: Not for this.
Minna: Yeah, not for this. If it had been a really smooth operation, maybe.
Rhi: [giggles] But it was the opposite of that.
Madge: This was not that. [giggles]
—
Josie: The plan I had was trying to get him to go in on something, like financially, and then ruin it.
Kim: Oh. I was thinking like going after his family.
Rhi: Oh, the Leverage con! Heh.
Minna: Eee!
Rhi: That is literally the plotline of every episode of Leverage.
Minna: Nice.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Find rich mark, convince them to put all of their money into a con, steal all of their money, ruin their life in the process, stand there looking cool like badasses at the end of the episode while the perp gets taken away.
Josie: Excellent.
Rhi: Leverage is so good, you guys.
Josie: [laughs]"

Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity:
Kim: The Rainforest Action Network’s Protect An Acre program works directly with grassroots and indigenous-led organizations to prevent vulnerable ecosystems from natural disaster and deforestation efforts. Since 1993 RAN has saved millions of acres of land and has collaborated closely with the indigenous communities who protect it. They uphold the values of fair trade, promoting the dignity and human rights of rainforest communities and fighting against corporations who seek to disproportionately consume it for resources. Right now the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil is being intentionally burnt down with the intent of creating more farmland for cattle.
President Bolsonaro has time and time again proved unwilling to stop the global crisis that is at hand. Of the world’s oxygen that is not produced from the ocean, one third of it comes from photosynthesis occurring on land, and of that one third the Amazon is responsible for nearly half. It is imperative that we begin and remain louder than ever on the side of science, the side of nature, and the side of indigenous people. To make a donation, visit www.ran.org, select Support, and go to Protect An Acre. For a donation even as low as $20 your money will go directly to protecting an acre of rainforest land and to the people who are its closest defenders.
Rhi: The news these days moves alarmingly fast and it can be really hard to keep up with the firehose blast of information. There are some excellent summary email newsletters like Celeste Pewter’s weekly updates, or What The Fuck Just Happened Today, as well as others that can help make it a little more manageable. If you can only focus on one crisis for a while or even if you just need to step away from that firehose and breathe, that’s okay too. We’re going to be in these fights for a long time, and taking care of yourself is how we all endure. If you’re in the US and you’re able, pick an issue or two from 5calls.org and call your representatives.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Recap [0:04:31]
[somber music starts]
Rhi: The last several months have not been easy for Duskwall’s newest band of hopeful vigilantes. The Magpies have faced spirits, criminals, corruption, and more, but few challenges have been as hard as saying goodbye to one of their own. With Phin’s family in danger, The Magpies, aided by the charming thief known as Needle, broke Phin out of Ironhook and helped her escape Duskwall. She’s free and as safe as anyone can be beyond Duskwall’s electroplasmic walls. With Phin gone and Needle vanished, The Magpies had to find a new equilibrium and a new purpose.
Plagued by threats from the Circle of Flame, they struggled to help the citizens of Duskwall and to stay even a single step ahead of their foes, and the reasons for their struggles came to light when Harker, Minx’s old friend, was kidnapped. Minx risked her life to save him and her friends but paid a high cost, and all the Magpies were left reeling by the revelation that the Circle had been aided by none other than their longtime friend Rigney who had been blackmailed with threats to his younger brother’s safety. They rescued Rigney’s brother and helped him escape Duskwall as well. They faced threats from old rivals and tried to uphold their obligations to new allies even as those alliances pushed them to make greater ethical compromises.
But of all the compromises, none are as great as those made to risk the safety of one’s friends and loved ones in the name of the greater good, a lesson Myra learned when her old mentor and employer, Salia, kidnapped her oldest friend. In the course of saving both her and her friend Jeren, some of Myra’s most closely guarded secrets were revealed. The Magpies have forged tighter bonds than ever, but will that be enough to see them through the threats to come? Only one way to find out.
[music ends]
## Story Continues [0:06:29]
Rhi: We open up over Duskwall, a wide, high shot of the city, the lights gleaming in the darkness. The camera pans in down through the city. It swoops over Ironhook Prison and then down to one of the many bridges cutting across the River Dosk. We see the magpies – Blaire, Minx, and Myra – making their way across the bridge and down into Dunslough. Dunslough is the poorest district in Duskwall. It mostly surrounds Ironhook Prison, and there’s a lot of prisoner’s families that live out here. There’s like a labor camp that prisoners who are sentenced to hard labor work there. There is also, one of the places where a lot of the people in Dunslough work is a place called The Mire which is a giant quarry where some kind of meteor struck in ancient times and now there’s a bunch of precious ores and jewels embedded in the earth around there, and so people will… A lot of it has been, at least a lot of the easier to find things have long since been claimed, but you know, there’s always people searching through the muck trying to find their ticket out of Dunslough.
This is not a place where— Even Minx and Myra, you two grew up in poverty, but it was better than this. Even where you were growing up you always kind of had the consolation of ‘well, at least it’s not Dunslough.’
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: Yeah. This is not a place where most people really want to spend any time. You all are heading down here because you got a tip from Lani and Roxanne. They’ve been continuing to investigate the members of the Circle of Flame. Recap real quick, you know a lot of the members: the Iruvian ambassador, Avrathi, who is dead thanks to Phin; Harvale Brogan, former owner of the Centuralia Club, is in prison; Lord Alistair Mora is a member who is still active out in the world; Lady Drake, magistrate; and Lady Eleanor Penderyn, a noblewoman whose family serves on the Council of Duskwall. You know that there are more members. Lani and Roxanne have continued to dig, looking for information, and they have turned up another name: Raffello.
Minna: Ooh! That’s “R”!
Rhi: Yep. Heh.
Minna: The painter guy with the hook-up for the drugs, right?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yep. Minx, this is a name that you recognize. Raffello is a very well-known painter in Duskwall. Their art style is a lot more abstract. People in the art scene know that the majority of their stuff is done in drug-fueled binges where they get just really high on ghost drugs and other weird, arcane, occult stuff and then just paint for 12 hours and then pass out for two weeks.
Josie: [laughs] Great life.
Rhi: Yeah, you know. It’s a living, I suppose? But, they are a very popular artist. They have made a huge name for themselves. They don’t have, like, they’re not attached to any particular nobility in terms of having a patron. They’ve actually been successful enough where they don’t need that kind of specific support, but you know, most rich people in the city own an original Raffello to kind of show their status. And apparently, they are a member of the Circle of Flame. Lani made contact with an alchemist who says that she used to work for Raffello and the Circle. Her name is Tya Laren.
Minna: Hey~! “TL”!
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Also, wait, don’t we know that name otherwise?
Kim: It sounds familiar.
Rhi: You do. This is an incredibly deep lore pull. She was first mentioned in Season 1, Episode 1!
Josie: What?!
Minna: Who–?!
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yep!
Josie: Who?!
Minna: Who was this? I know this name.
Rhi: She was mentioned in the report on the Gondoliers who were killed…
Minna: That’s it!
Rhi: …as being a Whisper or an alchemist who was on the run from the Circle of Flame.
Josie: Okay!
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah, that shit.
Minna: Holy shit.
Josie: Damn.
Rhi: My web!
Minna: [reading] Thorn asked them repeatedly what they knew about Kotar. Tya Laren, cultist wanted by the Wardens, not our problem. And the blood-iron ring.
Rhi: Yep.
Minna: So the Circle of Flame were trying to chase down Tya.
Rhi: Yep, all that time ago, and apparently she is hiding out in Dunslough. According to Lani, she made contact with them because she had learned that Lani and Roxanne had some ties to the Magpies, and the Magpies are trying to screw over the Circle of Flame, so it sounds like you’re people that she would like to know.
Josie: Yay.
Kim: In theory.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] So, the three of you make your way through Dunslough. There’s not really an address. You were given kind of a description of where she lives. You find the place. It’s a ramshackle hovel at the end of a street. You pass by it a couple times before one of you notices. There’s a symbol carved into the doorframe that is a seven-pointed star that has lines coming up from the top as if it is, you know, kind of movement lines as if it’s falling.
Kim: Interesting.
Josie: Huh.
Kim: Blaire takes note of this.
Rhi: Yeah. Blaire, you actually probably recognize this. Myra also might, but from two different sources. There is a forgotten god known as The Fallen Star.
Minna: Ooh… Wait! The Fallen Star ritual journal Fallen Star?
Rhi: Ding-ding-ding!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: So, you’re standing outside this hovel. This is where you’re supposed to meet an alchemist who has been on the run from the Circle for several months now.
Josie: I’ll just knock.
Rhi: There is a long pause… and then the door opens a crack, and the barrel of a pistol pokes through the crack.
Kim (as Blaire): What the fuck?!
Josie (as Minx): No need for that. I do believe you requested some birds.
Rhi: You see an eye peeking out over the top of the pistol.
Rhi (as ???): Who sent you?
Minna (as Myra): Our mutual friends, from the press.
Kim (as Blaire): The reporters Lani and Roxanne.
Rhi: There’s a pause and then the pistol withdraws and the door opens just wide enough for you to slip in one at a time.
Josie: So much for the code speak.
Rhi: You all head on in. It’s a little one room hovel. There’s a bucket in the corner to catch leaking water when it rains. There’s a bed shoved in one corner, table and chair in another. Most of the back wall is taken up with a very ramshackle, thrown together alchemist’s workbench. It looks like a lot of scavenged equipment. There’s a mix of an acidic sort of smell that you all, particularly Blaire, kind of just associate with alchemy, and also just kind of like a mildew smell. Standing in the middle of all this with the pistol still in her hand, held at her side, it’s pointed at the ground but she’s still holding onto it, is a woman in her 40s, very typical Akorosian features, light skin, dark hair, dark eyes. Her hair has been cut short. It looks like somebody, possibly her, just kind of took a knife to it and hacked it off. It’s very messy. She’s got really dark circles under her eyes. She is gaunt in an underfed sort of way. Her eyes are darting over the three of you.
Rhi (as Woman): Well, can’t say you’re exactly what I was expecting, but glad to make your acquaintance. Tya.
Josie (as Minx): You as well, although I hope we exceed expectations. I am Minx.
Josie: She’ll shake.
Rhi: Shakes your hand, cautiously.
Kim (as Blaire): Blaire Culhane, also from an alchemist background.
Kim: Blaire offers her hand.
Rhi: She steps in to shake your hand, but she does like one shake and then retreats back to keeping a good five or six feet between all of you.
Minna (as Myra): Myra. Would you prefer not to shake?
Rhi (as Tya): Just found it’s best to stay out of stabbing range.
Rhi: She rolls up a sleeve to show where there’s a scar on the top of her forearm. You all probably have scars like this. She got stabbed. [laughs]
Minna: Oh…
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear.
Rhi (as Tya): Yeah. I wouldn’t be down here if I had any other choice. So yeah, I heard rumors that somebody was tangling with the Circle and actually having some success in putting them down, so I figured you were people I ought to talk to.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, from what little we understand you’ve had a history with them as well?
Rhi (as Tya): Unfortunately.
Rhi: She looks around and suddenly seems to realize something.
Rhi (as Tya): Uh… huh. I guess there’s not really anywhere for you all to sit down. Sorry.
Kim (as Blaire): We can stand. It’s fine.
Rhi (as Tya): I started working for Raffello probably five, six years ago right when they were starting off. Even back then they paid real well, like real well. All I had to do was mix up their weird, very specific cocktails, and they made paintings, and they made more money, and I made more money, and it was great. Then I guess a couple years ago I met with some of Raffello’s friends, later found out that they had their weird, spooky club, the Circle, and they gave me a very interesting challenge. They wanted something that could see across space and maybe time and maybe into other parts of reality, and…
Josie (as Minx): That sounds familiar.
Kim (as Blaire): Did this involve any artifacts?
Rhi (as Tya): No… No. I mean, they wanted to find artifacts with it.
Kim (as Blaire): So all of this metaphysicality, this is induced with drugs? That’s what’s what these alchemists in the Circle of Flame are after?
Rhi: As a refresher, in the journal that you found talking about this ritual that they were doing, they were buying large quantities of a drug called Spiritsight, and this drug when given to people gave them extradimensional sight, they were able to see faraway places, they were able to locate objects. Side effect of this drug is death.
Minna: Yeah, and then several seers identified that maybe the Eye was in Iruvia, in Alduara, and then they got the Eye, which we stole, and then they started looking for the other relics and ordered like a double batch, and then three entries later is the last entry that we have.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s kind of what you know. Blaire, you would also know that this Spiritsight is made using ghosts.
Kim: Unfortunately, yeah.
Rhi: Flashback over. Tya shrugs.
Rhi (as Tya): They probably have alchemists there now, but I’m not working for them anymore. I bolted I guess about seven or eight months ago.
Kim (as Blaire): But reason still stands that they’re probably still at this. They’re probably still trafficking spirits and grinding them up into dust so they can get whatever they want.
Rhi (as Tya): I mean, yeah, almost certainly.
Kim (as Blaire): [huffs]
Minna (as Myra): Out of curiosity, you have a symbol above the door, what is the significance to you or to the ritual?
Rhi (as Tya): Oh, The Fallen Star? You know, a lot of alchemists find them a worthy patron.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. It was mentioned in their notes that they call this ritual using the Spiritsight the Fallen Star Ritual.
Rhi (as Tya): Wait, you got notes? What notes? What did you find?
Minna (as Myra): We got notes.
Rhi (as Tya): Did you get my research?
Minna (as Myra): Not your research—
Rhi (as Tya): Damn it!
Minna (as Myra): –so much as their commentary on the experiments.
Rhi (as Tya): [huffs] I mean, that’s something. Lady Penderyn is devout, I guess you’d say, to a number of forgotten gods. More of a flavor of the week if you ask me. She just sort of latches on to whichever one she finds convenient. It’s sort of a fickle devotion I guess. But yeah, I think most of the others just saw it as a means to an end, but she saw it as a way of expressing her faith for the time. My research is what I wanted to talk to you about. I wasn’t able to get it when I left. I sort of had to evacuate in a hurry.
Minna (as Myra): Where would your research have been?
Rhi (as Tya): Raffello’s studio over in Silkshore.
Kim (as Blaire): You think it’s still there?
Rhi (as Tya): Probably. That was sort of where the alchemy labs were set up.
Josie (as Minx): Are you certain it hasn’t been secreted away to some more secure sanctum?
Rhi (as Tya): It very well could have been. I can tell you where I left it when I was running for my life.
Kim (as Blaire): Judging from Raffello’s reputation, I’m guessing that he probably still has it in his possession.
Josie (as Minx): Most likely, but…
Rhi (as Tya): They could have moved it.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s not going to be easy to get no matter where it is.
Rhi (as Tya): As you can probably guess, I can’t really pay you much.
Josie (as Minx): Dear, at this point the Circle needs to be taken down either way. Payment is hardly at the forefront of our minds at the moment.
Rhi: She visibly relaxes and nods and finally holsters her pistol.
Rhi (as Tya): That’s good to hear. I need you to find my research, my notes, and bring them back.
Josie (as Minx): How will we know it?
Rhi: She goes over to her workbench and rustles around, lifts up a thick sheaf of papers and thumbs through it for a bit, and then pulls out just a few pieces of paper and comes back over.
Rhi (as Tya): I’ve been trying to recreate it from memory, because if I can recreate it I can create a counteragent.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, I see. It’s less about taking it from them and more getting it for that reason.
Rhi (as Tya): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Because I would think they made copies.
Rhi (as Tya): Probably, but if I can get my original research back I might be able to make it safer and then find a way to… I don’t know, I don’t really have a plan after that, I just know that we need to get the- if we can get the research away from them, if you can mess up whatever alchemical production they have in place, slow them down, that would be good.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think that it’s anywhere in the realm of possibility that this counteragent could recover the ghosts that were trafficked into these drugs?
Rhi (as Tya): Oh no. That’s basic spirit alchemy.
Kim (as Blaire): No, I know that. As soon as the spirits go through the ritual they’re ground up, they’re completely destroyed, there is no essence left whatsoever.
Rhi (as Tya): Yeah. I mean, there’s some essence left depending on how you prepare them, I mean, that’s why dream essence and thought essence are so damn popular.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m asking about recovering them fully.
Rhi (as Tya): No. They’re gone. Why would you want them back?
Kim (as Blaire): Isn’t dying enough?
Josie (as Minx): I think this might not be a discussion for this moment.
Rhi: Tya just looks baffled, has no idea what Blaire is getting at. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): We have our own spiritual concerns…
Rhi (as Tya): Uh-huh?
Josie (as Minx): …but you don’t seem to have any solution for them, so we don’t need to talk about that, so we just need to get the notes out and maybe mess some things up on the way out.
Rhi (as Tya): Yes, that would be great.
Josie (as Minx): Well, you’ve come to the right group of girls.
Rhi (as Tya): That’s good to hear. I heard you put Brogan in Ironhook.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, that was us.
Rhi (as Tya): Good. That guy was a real creep.
Josie (as Minx): I had seen the way he was running the club. That is definitely true.
Rhi (as Tya): Let me tell you what I can about Raffello’s studio.
Rhi: As far as general details you get about Raffello’s studio, it doesn’t have the same level of security that a lot of the other places that you’ve hit related to the Circle. There aren’t private guards. There’s pretty minimal spark-craft security or even mechanical security. There’s locks and stuff, but the real security is all pretty much arcane. There’s a lot of wards, there’s a lot of bound spirits, that is how Raffello protects their domain. They also have a kind of retinue, I guess would be the word, of other artists who follow in their style of doing a lot of drugs and then doing a lot of art.
Minna: God, is there a Raffello school of art?
Rhi: Not quite, but it’s, like…
Minna: Like lower case school. Heh.
Rhi: yeah, there’s a small group of artists who hang around Raffello and do similar art types, you know, some Whispers, some alchemists, that are just kind of in their circle, and they are probably also gonna be around, not necessarily as a security force – none of them are really trained combatants – but they are people who will potentially be in your way. That’s kind of the broad strokes of what she’s able to tell you about it. She is able to give you a fairly detailed description of the layout, so that’s gonna help you when you get to the engagement roll, but we’ll deal with that when we get into the score. So yeah, you all chat with her for a while and then head on out and rapidly make your way back towards the bridge that will lead you out of Dunslough.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, what were you trying to get at back there?
Kim (as Blaire): I just thought that there’s another way.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I imagine so, the way is to free the spirits before they undergo that process. You said yourself that once they are…
Kim (as Blaire): According to popular convention, yes.
Josie (as Minx): All right. You know the science better than I.
Kim (as Blaire): What I’m saying is that there has to be a way to undo it. All this damage that’s being done, it can’t keep happening. It’s not enough just to take down the Circle of Flame. We have to recover the spirits. It’s punishment enough to be viewed as monsters. Being crushed up into drugs and alchemical resources for people to just use up and then throw away, it’s not right.
Josie (as Minx): of course it isn’t, that’s terrible, but I don’t know how it can be possible once it’s done to reverse it any more than you can bring a spirit back to life.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s a different thing from, you know, bringing a spirit back to life in a corporeal form versus, you know, trying to pick up the pieces of dust and then bringing back their semblance of personality.
Josie (as Minx): Right. If a piece of wood is burned on a fire it can never be made wood again.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes it can.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): … Can it?
Josie (as Minx): Um…
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know much about alchemy.
Josie (as Minx): I, um, ahem.
Kim (as Blaire): If the wood is burned it turns into ash. That ash can be mixed with water and then turned into a pulp. That pulp can be laid over a stone slab, and if it cures long enough it can become wood again. Will it be the same as the first wood? No.
Josie (as Minx): So you are suggesting less a restoration and more a transformation?
Kim (as Blaire): A both, a mix of both.
Minna (as Myra): I mean, is there any theory behind it? Can that theoretically be done?
Kim (as Blaire): I believe it can. If trees can be made into paper then ghosts that are turned into drugs can be brought back too. I just know it.
Josie (as Minx): Well Myra, I think we are in the presence of a potential revolutionary in a certain scientific field.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): We will… I cannot help with the science of that whatsoever, but I would back you in the endeavor.
Minna (as Myra): I would love to hear more.
Kim (as Blaire): [whining] Minx! Minx, don’t you know me?
Josie (as Minx): Of course.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re trying to save ghosts here. I’m not going to sit around on this score if there’s anything I can do to help them.
Josie (as Minx): That is fine, dear. We will support how we can, but…
Minna (as Myra): There’s a human cost to this ritual, both to test subjects and to the spirits being distilled into these drugs, and I think we need to help with as much of that as we can. It’s not just about getting those research notes, although those research notes will help with the living human cost.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, that’s exactly what I’m getting at. Tya back there, she was only concerned about the research. She was so single-minded about it. She didn’t care about the ghosts. She didn’t care about the victims.
Josie (as Minx): I imagine there was a reason she was hired in the first place.
Minna (as Myra): You have to remember that there’s a certain way that most people view spirits. I don’t think it probably occurred to Tya Laren that that’s a cost.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, it is a cost, and this city needs to learn that.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, but Blaire, understand that we don’t have a way yet.
Kim (as Blaire): I have ways.
Rhi: [laughing] Okay, I think on that very ominous line…
Josie: [laughing nervously] Uh-huh…
## Score [0:29:32]
Rhi: Wanna shift over into Gather Info?
Josie: Yeah, sure.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I actually think this is a Gather Info stage that I’ll excel at, because I’ve been in the art community for like two seasons. [laughs]
Rhi: Yes! Yeah, so what do people want to do to learn some information?
Kim: I am probably going to roll a Study for my Gather Info.
Rhi: Okay. What are you looking for specifically?
Kim: Saving ghosts and recovering them from being distilled into drugs because that’s something she’s passionate about and knows things about from an alchemy background, and also on top of that, this research that she’s doing with Setarra in her downtime about summoning things from other places has started turning the cogs in her brain a bit.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, what do you wanna work on?
Minna: It almost makes sense for me to stake out the studio.
Rhi: Yeah. You can definitely do that. Kim, go ahead and roll your Study.
Kim: My highest was a 5.
Rhi: Five. Okay. It’s tough, because this is not something that anybody has ever really tried to do. Most of the research on ghost drugs is the making thereof. People are not really interested in undoing the process.
Kim: That’s fine. Blaire can still reverse engineer from that.
Rhi: I think that’s what it will be. I think this could potentially be more of a long-term project, but I think for the purposes of this score and this Gather Information, you get a lot, you dig very deep into how these kinds of drugs are made, and you have some ideas about how they could possibly be, if not exactly reversed, ways that you could add additional elements, alchemical reagents, that would just neutralize it so that it’s ineffective, if you wanted to just mess up their whole supply of it or something.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So yeah, you’ve got some info about how these drugs work.
Kim: Good.
Rhi: Minx. Art friends.
Josie: Yes. I think we know Minx’s process at this point [laughs] for mingling here.
Rhi: Yep. Your little something on the side, your business is like an art gallery, right?
Josie: Yes, pretty much.
Rhi: So you basically can just be sort of chatting with your visitors.
Josie: Yeah. Honestly, it’s kind of refreshing to her to be delving deep in that community again, because that stopped being her vice a while ago. I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. You’re just looking for anything about Raffello, right?
Josie: Yeah, as much as humanly possible.
Rhi: All right. They are one of those, you know, art figures that’s shrouded in mystery as far as where they came from, they just burst onto the scene about six years ago and became very popular very quickly, just sort of a right place, right time in terms of they managed to appeal, they created art that appealed to the right people and they just took off and have maintained that popularity ever since. They are kind of reclusive, don’t really come out and socialize very often, mostly just stick to Silkshore. When they do show up at parties it’s always, one, they usually just show up invited places, and two, it’s always a huge deal. It’s like having a huge celebrity just show up at your party. Yeah sure, they weren’t on the invite list, but holy crap, they’re here, at your party.
Josie: I wanna know if their reclusivity is an intentional affect or they just don’t give a shit. Like, are they deliberately secretive or is it just because they sleep for a solid week at a time that no one knows anything? [laughs]
Rhi: It seems to be more of the latter, that they are either lurching between a drug fueled creative binge or they are recovering from that.
Josie: Right. What do I know about the artists that kind of work with them? Have any come out of that studio notably?
Rhi: A few. None of them have hit the same level of fame, but there’s a handful that have gained some popularity, that have developed their own style. Nobody has really been as big as Raffello so far.
Josie: Gotcha. You said already that they kinda use spirits as security?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Okay. Do I know if Raffello has any ties I can pin down to other groups that would either provide for his spirit interests or if he has some sort of deal with the Spirit Wardens?
Rhi: Not with the Spirit Wardens, they try to avoid the Spirit Wardens. The Dimmer Sisters are their main supplier.
Josie: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: They’re kind of the main spirit traffickers in the whole city. There’s a few other small independent operations, but the Dimmer Sisters are very much trying to get a monopoly over the spirit trade. The few times that Raffello is seen out they’ve been seen visiting the Dimmer Sisters’ manor.
Josie: I see.
Minna: I forget. Are we friends with them?
Kim: I would prefer not to.
Josie: We did A job for them.
Rhi: Yeah. They were one of your friendly contacts, well positive contacts when we started, when we built the crew. You did them a favor, and then it’s basically you are currently even.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: You don’t owe them anything, they don’t have any particular problem with you, but they also don’t feel particularly loyal to you.
Josie: Wouldn’t it be fun if we could somehow pin this on the Dimmer Sisters?
Kim: That would be fun.
Rhi: That would be fun.
Josie: Because they’re providing him with the spirit stuff and they’re the ones who would likely know if he obtained some sort of spiritual refinement process that they didn’t know about and they would want it.
Rhi: Yeah. That’s a possibility.
Josie: That would be nice to do that and then pin it on someone else so that we don’t incur more Circle hate.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s definitely a possibility.
Josie: And frankly, the Dimmer Sisters deserve what’s coming to them.
Kim: Agreed.
Rhi: [chuckles suspiciously] All right! Myra, you’re gonna stake out the studio?
Minna: Yeah, let’s do that. Let me figure out what action that would be…
Rhi: Probably either Study or Survey.
Minna: I’m gonna argue for Study there, [whispering] because I’m much better at it.
Rhi: Yeah. You are sitting and staring intently at one particular building for like a day. That’s a Study.
Minna: That’s a 6!
Rhi: Nice. Okay. Cool. You go to the address that Tya gave you. It’s in a neighborhood of Silkshore called Fogcrest which is kind of the Bohemian artsy neighborhood where if you want to…
Minna: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rhi: …live out your dream of being a starving artist you go to Fogcrest. They have, Raffello has a three-story mansion basically near the top of the hill. In my mind it’s kind of a slightly rundown three-story Victorian style mansion, so it’s got a little tower and big fancy roof and all of that fun stuff.
Minna: Porches running across the entire front of it.
Rhi: Yep. It’s rundown in a way that it’s probably only external. The paint is kind of worn and chipped, but the windows are really nice, so it’s clearly like… a little bit of a style thing.
Minna: It’s distressed.
Rhi: Distressed. That’s the perfect word for it. Yes, the building is distressed.
Minna: Stylishly distressed.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. So, there’s an apartment building across the street, and you get up to the roof and just watch this place for a while. There aren’t any guards posted. Over the course of the day you see about six different people come and go, none of whom are Raffello. You all have a description of what they look like. You identify that there’s about six other people, at least, that are hanging around in there. I think throughout the day you periodically will switch into looking into the ghost field, and you are able to see from your vantage point there’s at least one bound spirit on each floor that’s kind of patrolling.
Minna: Interesting.
Rhi: It’s kind of hard to see because of the distance, and also just sort of interference. You’re able to see there’s a lot of arcane wards on the doors and the windows, some of the interior doors… and then there’s just a lot of arcane stuff in the building that leaves its own signatures in the ghost field. So, you’re not sure, there might be a second ghost on the third floor, but you know for sure that there’s three ghosts, there’s a lot of arcane wards, and then there’s at least six non-Raffello people and then Raffello in the building.
Minna: You said there was wards, right?
Rhi: Uh-huh.
Minna: Mostly arcane wards, or does it look like spark-craft as well?
Rhi: You don’t really see any of the wiring going to the house that you would need for an intense spark-craft security system. You’re guessing that it’s primarily these wards, these arcane wards.
Minna: Yeah. Does it look like there’s any good routes to try and sneak in?
Rhi: There is… I think your two options are there is a root cellar, like those cellar doors that are off to the side of the house, that aren’t as heavily warded. There are still wards on them but it’s not as much. And, there is in the yard – you know, “yard,” there’s not really grass or plants or anything – around this house there is a huge, metal sculpture that looks like a tree, that is tree sized…
Minna: Huh.
Rhi: …that you could probably climb to get up to the second or third story. It’s a question of do you want to come in through the basement or do you wanna come in through an upper story.
Minna: Cool.
Rhi: Yep. You all have reconvened probably about a day later with all of your information. What’s your strategy? What’s your approach? How are you gonna go about getting in there and stealing some notes and breaking some stuff?
Josie: Now that, I have no fucking idea.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Break in.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Well, I mean yes, but how?
Minna: Do we wanna do the root cellar or the tree? My vote is the tree…? There’s more security if we take the tree route, but also we don’t have to go up through three floors worth of… people?
Kim: Of wards, yeah.
Josie: Right. My concern is how we get past the ghosts that are patrolling.
Kim: I can take care of that.
Josie: Okie-dokie. [laughs]
Minna: [laughs] No further questions.
Kim: I got this.
Josie: Blaire’s on a fucking mission this week.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I guess we’re doing a Stealth mission?
Minna: Unless you want to try and not break in and disguise yourself and get let in as a patron, or artist?
Josie: I could, but that’s not the sort of thing that happens in a day, really.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, and the Gather Info didn’t really reflect that.
Minna: Also, there’s only so many times we disguise ourselves as not ourselves to our actual enemies.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Right. I think really this might be our first Occult score?
Rhi: “Engage supernatural power.”
Josie: I don’t know what that looks like.
Kim: Oh, that means… No, we just dive off the deep end on the weird shit.
Rhi: Right, but what exactly- how are you- I need specifics. What supernatural power are you engaging?
Kim: Oh.
Josie: Either some possibly backfiring spiritual event that gets rid of the ghost guards, or temporary invisibility to ghosts.
Kim: Both work. I am also not opposed to just straight up engaging with them and consorting to get them to go away.
Rhi: Well, here’s the thing. It’s not a question of convincing the ghosts to leave, it’s a question of breaking the arcane seals that are binding them.
Kim: Yeah, no, I feel like I can really do that.
Josie: We will have limited time before the Spirit Wardens appear.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay. Where… I feel like you have to do the ritual in the vicinity.
Josie: You did say there was an apartment complex across the way.
Kim: I guess I’m just trying to gauge the distance radius of this spell’s power. Wouldn’t it make more sense to cast this closer to Raffello’s studio as opposed to away from it?
Josie: I was thinking if we can sneak into the basement of the building across the way or something.
Rhi: Or you could get into the basement- You have an access point to get into the basement of Raffello’s studio, and you could do it down there potentially.
Kim: Yeah, I can absolutely do it down there and then work our way up.
Josie: Okay. That sounds like a plan.
Rhi: Yeah. All right. Engagement roll. One for luck. For once you don’t actually have anyone directly interfering in this operation.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: So, this is going to be a 3d6 roll. Phew, that’s a good roll for you guys, 5-5-6. You are gonna be starting in a controlled position. I think we are gonna cut right to you’re all in the basement of Raffello’s studio. I think the basement… [laughs] You’re not the first people to do some kind of weird ass rituals down here. Blaire came I think with candles and chalk and salt and other, you know—
Kim: Liquids, vials, ink.
Rhi: –all kinds of stuff, and then you get in there and there’s just half of the stuff you need is already here.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Awesome. Restocks.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna help herself.
Rhi: Yeah. Fortunately, nobody’s in the basement right now. Blaire, how does this ritual look? What are you doing? I know a lot of Blaire’s rituals have been the sacred geometry circles on the floor sort of thing. Is it another kind of that?
Kim: Some of that, yes. Instead of doing sacred geometry on the floor she’s going to do a very ornate one on the wall. She has a curved dagger with her, a very small one that’s curved at the end, and she has that strapped to the belt across her chest. While she is painting this geometry on the wall there are sparks at each corner that is lit by a single candle and remains lit despite no visible wick being in between the bricks of the wall. From there, the sigil starts to seep, it starts to leak a little bit almost as if it’s bleeding, not so much in the sense of red blood or wine, but it’s very dark black with these specks of gold in the corners. She’s going to wait a minute, let that simmer until vapors start coming out from underneath the bricks, and that’s when it starts working.
Rhi: [laughing] I’m sorry, it’s very cool, but the description of simmer just gave me this sudden flash of Blaire hosting a cooking show style thing. “So—“
Minna: yes!
Josie: Yep! [laughs]
Kim: “If you can’t summon your own flames from hell, store bought is fine.”
Rhi: Yeah. Exactly. [laughs] The vapor rising up through the house is what’s gonna break the bonds on these spirits? Okay.
Kim: It’s a very, very fine, undetectable, lavender steam.
Rhi: Nice. Yeah, I think it might be slightly visible…
Kim: Oh it is, right.
Rhi: …but this is also a house where there’s just kind of a permanent haze in the air, so nobody’s gonna notice.
Kim: Exactly.
Rhi: But, you do kind of have to hang out down here for a little bit to wait for it to do its work. You’re basically standing down here, all of you, waiting quietly to start hearing screaming from upstairs.
Kim: Yup. Blaire’s just sharpening her dagger in the meantime.
Rhi: As you’re standing down here… I think among the ritual accoutrement that’s in this place there is a large glass bottle of sea water. I think the three of you are just all standing around pacing, maybe watching this violet vapor—not violet, lavender vapor drift upwards, and behind you on this shelf the sea water in this bottle starts to swirl, and then the bottle shakes a little bit and then crashes to the floor, and all three of you turn to see a tall figure rising up out of the sea water splashed across the floor.
Josie: Minx’s hand immediately goes to the hilt of her sword. She doesn’t draw it, but…
Rhi: And it resolves into the figure of Setarra, who I think glances across the three of you, looks to Minx, narrows her eyes, and says:
Rhi (as Setarra): That’s a quick way to die.
Kim (as Blaire): Put it away, Minx. It’s fine.
Josie: Minx will step back behind the other two and relax her stance a little bit, but she still has one hand on the sword hilt.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Just not visible.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: I think Setarra looks over to Blaire.
Rhi (as Setarra): So this is what you’ve been wasting your time with instead of focusing on your studies.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s circumstantial.
Rhi (as Setarra): Meaning?
Kim (as Blaire): Meaning this is related to our summons work.
Rhi (as Setarra): I suppose we shall see.
Rhi: She looks at Blaire expectantly in a “so, what are we doing” kind of expression.
Kim (as Blaire): There’s an artist in this studio just a few floors above who is prominent in the community, but even more than that they’re notorious for spirit drug trafficking and alchemy. I get my hand on those drugs and that research and it fills in the gaps for our Book of Summons.
Rhi: Setarra regards you for a long moment and then nods.
Rhi (as Setarra): Very well. I will be interested to see what you and your friends are capable of.
Rhi: Setarra looks over the three of you again, and then glances up and goes:
Rhi (as Setarra): Ah, it’s about to start.
Rhi: Then there is a ghostly wail, and then screaming starts from upstairs, very human screaming.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s working.
Minna (as Myra): What’s working?! What did you do?
Kim (as Blaire): I didn’t do anything. The spirits are just being freed from their wards, that way we have a quicker access into the studio. The humans are gonna get a bit of a scare, but it’ll be fine. I’ll be able to jar them up before any harm comes to anyone.
Rhi: Eh, you’ll see. That’s your plan anyway.
Josie (as Minx): Well then, we best get to the studio.

Josie: Also, I’m poised waiting for Kim’s TMNT reference.
Rhi: Oh. [chuckles]
Kim: I mean, at this point I am a double-edged sword, because it could be a TMNT reference, it could be an art history reference, or – and this is a deep pull – a Good Omens reference, so you never know with me anymore.
[laughter]
Rhi: Kim has a powerful, chaotic meme energy.
Josie: Yes.
Minna: Or it could be, you know, the Ferrero candies which was my first thought. [giggles]
Kim: Yeah, that too.

"Season 3, Episode 3: The Haunted Press Score, Part 1 Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly.
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. I am recording this intro a bit earlier than usual as I’m preparing the episode before I leave for AcadeCon. I’m really looking forward to playing some new games, catching up with friends and handing out just a ton of Magpies bookmarks. I really hope to see some listeners there.
All of the normal support announcements are still true. Reviews are awesome. Back us on Patreon if you can and if you want to potentially win a Magpies pin. Check out our Shapeways shop to buy a Magpies pin of your very own. With Patreon, I’m especially excited, because we’re getting ever closer to our 400 a month goal, and when we get there we’ll be able to eventually set up a merch shop. I have a whole document that’s just a list of t-shirt ideas and I really want to be able to wear many of them someday. And I bet a lot of you do too.
Also, we continue to get closer to unlocking the Whitehollow worldbuilding special episode. As a refresher, The Magpies will soon be leaving Duskwall for a brief trip to the city of Whitehollow, and because there’s basically no information on that city in the core Blades in the Dark book, The Magpies crew spent some time building out the city. It was a ton of fun and there are some really cool gems in there that we weren’t able to work into the episode. So, if this bonus episode gets released, you’ll get some cool extra information. The bonus episode will be released when we reach 100,000 downloads. Right now, we’re at about 97,000, which is so close. So, encourage new folks to listen and keep those downloads coming. I would love to get this bonus episode released before The Magpies take their trip in the show. Next, Minna is gonna tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Minna: This month we are spotlighting Planned Parenthood. They provide reproductive services from birth control and STD screening to abortions. They also provide education and are working to fight abortion bans across the nation. I strongly believe that everybody has the right to whatever reproductive services and choices they want. If you would like to support Planned Parenthood, you can go to their website at PlannedParenthood.org and click the donate button. Or, you could find a local organization and support them as well, that is also great.
Rhi: I’m recording this intro right after local elections in places like Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia, and all of those places saw losses, some very substantial, for the GOP. With Democratic majorities in state government, there’s a new opportunity to undo the gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts of the Republican party. So, whether you live in one of those states or not, make sure to reach out to your state and local officials to emphasize the important of protecting and expanding voting rights. Election security and people’s ability to vote are absolutely critical as we move towards the 2020 elections.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [0.03.10]
Rhi: We open up on an article in the Doskvol Daily. There is a big headline splashed across the front page, accompanied by a sketch of a familiar artist. The headline reads, “Artist Raffello Missing, Feared Dead Following Attack on Studio.”
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: By Anita Argent, staff reporter. “The famed and beloved artist Raffello remains missing following a devastating and destructive attack on their Fogcrest studio. Members of their artistic enclave report that spirits suddenly converged on the studio and attacked, sending the artists fleeing into the street. During the attack the death bell sounded, and the Spirit Wardens and Inspectors who arrived reported a grisly, blood-stained scene in Raffello’s private rooms. But there was no sign of the artist’s body and the Wardens fear the worst, that Raffello has perished, and with their body removed, their spirit will be unleashed upon the city. ‘It is an utter tragedy’, Lady Eleanor Penderyn told the Daily, ‘Raffello was not only a uniquely talented visionary, they were also a dear friend. This brutal, senseless attack strikes at the heart of everything that makes Duskwall beautiful.’
Minna: [stifles a giggle]
Rhi: “While reports are as yet unconfirmed, sources within The Bluecoats claim that the investigation into Raffello’s disappearance has once again turned towards the treacherous terrorists known as The Magpies. This gang of criminals has long struck out at the pillars of Duskwall society, and it appears that this time they may be responsible for the loss of one of our greatest artists.”
Josie: Looks like our plan didn’t work.
Rhi: The investigation is looking at you, it’s looking at The Dimmer Sisters, but you’re an easier target than The Dimmer Sisters. The Dimmer Sisters have too many connections in polite society.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, where are you all reading this article? Where do we find The Magpies?
Kim: Can we be at The Hound’s Paw?
Josie: Sure…
Rhi: It has been a while.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So yeah, you’re at The Hound’s Paw, at your usual table. I think Rigney has brought you your usual drinks. He seemed very happy to see you. It’s been quite some time since you all have just kinda come down here to hang out. Yeah, how is everyone reacting to this article?
Josie: Minx, who had come in a little off already, she’s wearing her hair down, which is pretty uncommon, but otherwise seemed fine, like, is maybe settling in being comfortable around Rigney again, picked up the paper, took one look at it, and just sort of kind of went blanch white.
Rhi: Ooh.
Josie: And it still just kind of like that.
Kim (as Blaire): So, let me get this straight. First, we were organized, and now we’re terrorists? How does that add up?
Josie (as Minx): I, well, um… I don’t see how don’t terrorists and organization are mutually exclusive. If they were gonna brand us so, we may as well be organized.
Kim (as Blaire): But we’re not organized.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Yes, but it’s important to convey the— you know what dear, I can’t even pull that right now.
Minna (as Myra): There’s not really enough of us to organize, is there?
Kim (as Blaire): No. They must think that there are more of us than there really are. That’s the only thing I can think of.
Josie (as Minx): At least they are operating under useful delusions.
Kim (as Blaire): How is it useful?
Josie (as Minx): They will be looking in other places and expecting a much more sizeable force.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I guess so.
Josie (as Minx): Really it’s more, the more wrong information they have about us, the better.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Point taken.
Josie (as Minx): Drat. It seems our ploy at the end there didn’t quite take.
Minna (as Myra): Well, there’s not much use dwelling on it, is there? This is the situation we’re in now.
Kim (as Blaire): Here’s the other thing, here’s the other thing. What happened to the body? We didn’t do anything with the body.
Josie (as Minx): No.
Kim (as Blaire): So, who took it?
Minna (as Myra): That is a good question.
Rhi: I will— so, earlier in the score, before the killing happened and the death bell started ringing, which alerted the Spirit Wardens that they needed to move in, you all did set off some kind of alarm.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Kim: We did?
Rhi: That had some other form of backup coming. Could be that those, whoever that backup was, probably somebody from the Circle of Flame—
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Removed the body before the Spirit Wardens could get to it.
Josie (as Minx): In which case, they may be using Raffello’s spirit for information, and potentially against us.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, that’s ghoulish. No pun intended.
Josie (as Minx): I was about to say, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): So, does that mean we should rescue them?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, we don’t really know where the rest of The Circle may operate since the Centuralia Club and other lairs have been, well, taken out by us.
Rhi: And also, you know, you killed them on purpose. Rescuing their spirit seems a little counterproductive.
Kim (as Blaire): They’re using them, you know?
Josie (as Minx): It would be more a matter of protecting ourselves than rescuing them.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm.
Josie (as Minx): For me, at least.
Rhi: [laughs] Death cleanses all sins in Blaire’s eyes. It doesn’t matter what you did when you were alive, once you’re dead.
Kim (as Blaire): Listen, we’re all gonna fucking die. [laughs]
Rhi: “Listen,” Blaire says to the voice in the sky.
Josie and Kim: [laugh]
Josie (as Minx): There is more I want to touch on with regards to Raffello, but this is not the place to do it. I did have an idea for how perhaps to help someone out and get our information flowing again.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh yeah?
Josie (as Minx): Well, Lani and Roxanne have been out of real journalism for a while now, and it is partially because of their involvement with us that they are like that. And I think it’s time we make those reparations somehow. I was thinking of purchasing them a printing press, although after looking into it I don’t think even I can afford such.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I was going to say, there is absolutely no way we could afford something like that. I have no money.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Well, fortunately we have quite a bit of experience in thieving, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Thieving?
Josie (as Minx): So, I was thinking of turning to that solution.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Amongst us, yes.
Rhi: So, in terms of pulling this off I have a couple ideas, but I will also defer to the three of you, if you have any ideas for where you might be able to obtain a printing press. I did some research earlier today on Victorian-era printing presses.
Kim: Hey!
Rhi: They’re very big. Steam-powered, so they would be probably, you know, running off of electricity, electroplasmic powered, in this setting. So, you would need not only the printing press but somewhere to keep it and, you know, store ink and paper and other supplies that you would need. So, you’re looking at obtaining not just a printing press, but some property.
Josie (as Minx): It seems as though Seeks may have had the right idea. We need to steal a building.
Minna and Rhi: [laugh]
Josie (as Minx): Preferably one with a printing press already in it.
Minna (as Myra): How does one steal a building?
Josie (as Minx): Cleverly, of course.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): But specifically, how does one steal a building? You can’t, like, pick up a building in the middle of the night and then walk away with it and put it in your treasure chest, you know?
Josie (as Minx): No, we needn’t do that. We need simply invent an elaborate and elegant story of intrigue in the business world and ensure something changes hands. To us.
Kim (as Blaire): We could haunt the building. And then nobody will want it and then we’re interested buyers for some reason and then we just, you know. Get the house. Or the building.
Minna (as Myra): Are you suggesting the return of Lyra Langdon?
Kim and Rhi: [gasps]
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): You have read my mind, Myra.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Josie (as Minx): I shall have to write a sequel!
Kim (as Blaire): I’m not giving you more fanfiction fodder, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): [sighs]
Rhi: Yes, you are.
Kim (as Blaire): No, I’m not! It’s gross to write fanfiction about real people.
Josie (as Minx): We’re not. These are the masks we wear.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re not real people?
Josie (as Minx): No, Blaire, the whole point is that they are not actually us. We’re pretending to be people who do not exist and the fiction is about those people.
Rhi: You’re LARPing as your OCs, is what Minx is saying.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh…
[laughter]
Rhi: So, your plan, it sounds like, is to locate a building that contains the needed printing press.
Josie: Slap the roof of it, say, “This baby can fit so many ghosts in it.”
Kim (as Blaire): Yes!
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): And I will unleash them!
Rhi: Yeah, Blaire makes the place be haunted, and then you all can buy the building for a really low price.
Kim (as Blaire): The low, low price of [whispers] it’s free real estate.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: I’m sorry, I am feral silly billy today.
Rhi: It’s okay. It’s good.
Josie: Welcome to Magpies: Meme Edition.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Isn’t that every night?
Josie: Rhi’s keeping all of this in, right? [laughs]
Rhi: I will be keeping a fair amount of it in, yes.
Kim: [laughs]
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: I think for irony’s sake I’m gonna cut this conversation though.
Josie: Excellent.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: Okay, so the Doskvol Daily is sort of the big newspaper printing press in town, but there are other book publishers and smaller printers that you might be able to go after.
Josie: Yes, I feel like the Doskvol Daily might be a little bit too high-profile for this to work successfully.
Rhi: Yes. That’s like being like, “Let’s steal the New York Times.”
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Bold as hell, also not gonna fuckin happen.
Josie (as Minx): We will need to target someone who has what we need, but it also not particularly high-profile, but not so low-profile that we are scaring an honest person out of work in favor of the people we favor. We need to find an arse who is not the Doskvol Daily.
Rhi: Yep. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): So this way it is firmly for a good cause.
Rhi: Sounds like you know what kinda info you need to gather.
Josie: And for once I think we might be able to do it by reading. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): I read.
Minna: So do I.
Josie: I’m not saying that we don’t read it’s just we’re usually going all over the city and pulling on all of these weird connections for Gather Info. We might be able to just sit down in The Nest after some trips to the news stand and figure one out.
Rhi: Yeah. If you wanna start there, with everybody kind of doing some Study rolls, or however you wanna approach it?
Josie (as Minx): Well, Minx’s strong suit is not Studying. Her strong suit is finding things at a glance. I think Minx wants to actually collect the texts and try to get a good sampling that the other two can pull through.
Rhi: Okay yeah, and try and find some decent targets?
Josie: Yeah. Basically, I’m making a case for Survey instead of Study, because I have a dot in that. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, that works for me. Does that sound good to the other two of you?
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: And I think what this looks like is Minx adopting a more business-like outfit for the day and a pair of round spectacles with which to peruse various bookstores and news stands for what she’s looking for. Basically, giving the appearance of looking like she knows what she’s doing, but maybe a bit less than what she conveys. [laughs]
Minna: I can only picture Legally Blonde. [laughs] Elle Woods.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: You know what? Not far off.
Rhi: Okay, so you’re just trying to gather a whole bunch of, kind of like, a representative swathe of stuff that’s published by different places in the city, right?
Josie: Precisely.
Rhi: Okay. I think with a 4, that’s a standard amount of information, I think you get a pretty solid selection. There’s probably a few, like, very small publishers that you don’t get, but those are also probably the kind of people you wouldn’t want to target. Newspapers and pamphlets and magazines and a few small books that, like, there’s no rhyme or reason thematically to what the subjects are. It’s just a good representation of the different publishers in the city.
Josie: And I think Minx comes back to The Nest victorious, with twine bundles of these under her arms, and dramatically spreads them out across the table.
Josie (as Minx): Ladies, we have papers. And in these papers, I want you to look for pictures of Spiderman.
Rhi: God dammit!
[laughter]
Minna: Bringing that one back, are we?
Josie: [laughs] Yep.
Rhi: [long sigh] Alright. Well. Somebody roll me some kind of Gather Info roll on this pile of papers that Minx has gleefully brought home for you.
Kim: I will do a Study. Okay, that’s a 6, my dude.
Rhi: Okay. So, Blaire, as you’re rifling through all of these papers, what is something that somebody could be publishing that you all would find objectionable?
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: Besides the Doskvol Daily.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Something where you’re like, “You know what? We could make better use of this.”
Kim: If the Doskvol Daily is Fox News, then whatever we go after for this printing press is probably like, InfoWars or Breitbart or something.
Josie: Are you suggesting we take out Alex Jones? Cause I’m down for that.
[laughter]
Minna: I mean, either someone who’s publishing either, like, anti-union screeds, or anti-Skovlander screeds, or both.
Josie and Rhi: Ooh.
Rhi: Somebody who’s really racist against Skovlan is—
Minna: Just putting out horrible pamphlets.
Josie: Yeah, we haven’t, like, done that yet.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. The whole Skovlan thing hasn’t really been touched on a ton in this story, but it’s definitely a thing that is happening in the background. The Unity War ended just a few years ago and there’s a ton of Skovlan refugees in the city, and there is definitely, yeah. There is a lot of anti-Skovlan sentiment within the city. I like that idea, I think it works really well.
Kim: It does.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Blaire, you’re rifling through all of these papers and it’s just, like, a complete mishmash of random things that Minx picked up while she was out and about in the city, but you eventually come across a few pamphlets that are really, really just blatant anti-Skovlan propaganda. God, I’m trying to do this without just quoting directly from all of the, like, horrible anti-immigrant bullshit that we are currently living in.
Minna: Ugh. [sighs]
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Boy oh boy.
Rhi: It’s that’s kinda stuff. I’m not gonna… it’s that sort of crap. It is all that sort of very anti-refugee, anti-immigrant garbage.
Kim: Gross.
Rhi: In these pamphlets. And they are published by Dalmore press and there is an address listed. Somebody like this wouldn’t be able to afford Charterhall. Um, honestly, it’s probably in Crow’s Foot. Because majority of the Skovlan refugees are set up either in the docks or, like, down in Charhollow and Coalridge. So, there’s a lot of people in those sort of neighborhoods where that sentiment will find an audience, unfortunately. And it looks like, kinda looking at the quality, you can tell that this is probably, you know, definitely a smaller operation. The only stuff that this— at least that Minx picked up, that this person has seems to just be pamphlets. They’re not printing, like, full books or papers or anything like that.
Josie (as Minx): Well, easy target.
Rhi: I like that you’re developing this strategy of you new way of clearing a building is to just unleash ghosts upon it. Because you did that last episode too. [laughs]
Josie: I mean, it’s effective.
Minna: Yeah, the problem is we did ghost riot once and now we’re just doing mini ghost riots, because we learned it worked.
Rhi: Yeah, you find a strategy that works, like, stick with it.
Minna: Former workers the world unite.
Rhi: Do you wanna go as a group, or I know Myra hasn’t done a Gather Info, wanna go scout this building out and try to, you know, get a read? A lay of the land?
Kim: We can go as a group.
Josie: Might as well.
Minna: Yeah, that makes sense.
Rhi: So, you all troop over to Crow’s Foot, to the address printed on these terrible, terrible pamphlets, and yeah, you can’t really do a group Gather Info, so why don’t we start with Myra rolls something to get a look at this place, and then if you all wanna do additional ones after, we can do that. So.
Minna: I am looking at… can I Study?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: 5.
Rhi: Okay. I think it’s a building that the ground floor is a business, and then there’s some, like, apartments above it.
Josie: Mm.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: So, it’s gonna be a three-story building. Ground level is this printing press, and then apartments on the two floors above.
Minna: Who lives above?
Rhi: You’re not sure from looking at it from the outside. You could probably, you know, go dig into some records to find out. The odds are that if this Dalmore person owns the printing press, he might own the whole building and like, you know, live in one of those apartments and rent the rest out.
Minna: Well, if he owns the whole building and we steal/buy the whole building from him, that’s fine. It’s just if he only owns the ground floor for some reason and we then have awful neighbors, that’s going to be awkward. But we can deal with it.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Yeah, you would have to investigate, I think. Like, looking at public records. Which I think you could do very easily to figure out ownership of that. But just kind of from examining the building out here, no.
Minna: Are there inactive times? Like, times when clearly everyone’s asleep and the ground floor is dark?
Rhi: Yeah. You all are… I dunno, what time of day do you think you all are over here?
Minna: I think, yeah, around dinner time we go to check it out. And then just hang out for a while.
Rhi: Yeah, so you get there, you know, five or six in the evening. The ground floor is closed. It’s, you know, locked up. There’s a closed sign in the front. It doesn’t look like it’s the kind of place that really has a lot of visitors. There are kind of big windows on the front, but they’ve got blinds pulled down across them to cover it up. The name Dalmore Press is in pretty small letters on the door. There are lights on in some of the apartments above, though, and you can kinda see, you know, people moving around. Like, silhouettes, through curtains and stuff. You can tell that those are occupied. I know one of the questions that came up earlier is to see if there are any particular wards against spirits on the place?
Minna: Ooh, yeah.
Rhi: So, there is a spiritbane charm hanging above the door on the ground floor. There might be some stuff in, you know, individuals may have things in the apartments above. Spiritbane charms are pretty common, so they may have something individually in those units, but again, checking from the outside you’re not certain. This is like a Tier 1 place that you’re looking at, this is not somebody that has an enormous amount of money, does not have arcane wards, probably doesn’t even have any sparkcraft security on the place. You’re just going to have to get through some locks. If you’re even trying to break in. You probably don’t have to break in to unleash some ghosts.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: The issue might be more making sure the ghosts do what you want them to.
Josie: Mm hmm. And also, so we are able to approach before the ghosts are handled by, say, a Spirit Warden patrol or something like that.
Rhi: Yes. Yes, that is true.
Josie: Because we don’t actually want the ghosts to get caught.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I feel like the way to do that might be to see if we can offer some of the more conscious ghosts we know something.
Kim: Oh!
Josie: To go in and do their thing, but so they’re just like—
Kim: I know who to call.
Josie: But, you know, they’re still aware, so if things get dangerous, they can just back out.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Kim: What was her name again?
Rhi: Uh, Katrina? With The Reconciled? Was that who you were thinking of?
Kim: No, no, no, I’m thinking of the ditsy one.
Rhi: [delighted laugh]
Josie: From the trial. [laughs]
Rhi: Um, uh… Tira.
Kim: Tira!
Rhi: Yeah, no, Tira would be super down for this. [giggles]
Josie: Maybe it’s not so much a traditional haunting, maybe Tira goes in and annoys the guy out of this.
Kim: I like that.
Minna: Oh, Tira would love this shit. She wanted to do all that annoying poltergeist stuff.
Kim: Yes.
Minna: And especially if you tell her this guy’s an asshole.
Rhi: Tira is the perfect choice for this, you are so right. Oh my God.
Kim: Yes.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Myra, did you still wanna, or Minx, one of you or both, did you still wanna kinda go poke into the records to try and figure out who owns the whole building, who lives—
Minna: I think Myra’s the kind of thorough that would do this, I don’t know about Minx.
Josie: Well, I have a bunch of things I wanna do, but I’m trying to decide whether they’re flashbacks and there’s time to do them, or if they’re setup actions. Like, what I wanna do is like, try to establish our haunted property liquidation scam before the actual haunting occurs. Like, you know, make some pamphlets and spread them around the neighborhood and…
Rhi: Um. Either way, it would end up kind of giving you an advantage when you’re talking with this guy to convince him that you are legitimate business owners.
Josie: Yeah. I might just do that as a setup action.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: To get it out of the way.
Rhi: Yeah. What skill are you gonna use to do this?
Josie: I’m gonna argue for Sway, since that is effectively what I’m trying to do right now. I’m just trying to lend credence here.
Rhi: Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
Josie: That’s 2, 1, 1.
Rhi: Yeah. Alright, so on a 2…
Josie: I think it comes off as too skeevy.
Rhi: Or I was gonna say that it’s too recent. You’re not able to really kind of establish, like, “Oh yeah, they’ve definitely been around for a while.” You sound brand new.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: But also probably a little skeevy. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] okay.
Minna: This has the vibe of those, like, poster boards you see on street corners, like, “We’ll buy your house, cash.”
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: That are done in permanent marker on a poster board.
Josie: [laughs] Oh dear.
Rhi: But yeah you do put up a whole bunch of signs for, would you like to share your business name here and your pitch? Just read off the whole poster, really.
Josie: Okay. [laughs] I will do that for your listening pleasure. “Spectra and Associates Liquidation. Got ghosts? Get cash! If you’re experiencing a haunting, you may be eligible for compensation. Liquidate your bespectred property and get cash now. No markup. No questions asked.”
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Alright, so that is what Minx is doing, probably for the next couple days. Blaire, let’s have you roll for tracking down Tira. How do you think you go about doing that?
Kim: I imagine that’s an Attune.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 6.
Rhi: You talk to some of the people you know in The Reconciled and you’re able to, you know, get pointed in the right direction. And you start hearing about a poltergeist who has been haunting the Jayan Hall of Alchemy at Charterhall. But not in, like, a scary or disturbing way. Kind of more in an annoying way, or sometimes just a funny way. Like, you know, there have been a couple, like, particularly ill-liked professors who have gotten pantsed in the middle of lectures by a spirit.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Random things written in chalk on the chalkboards by a ghostly hand. So, you manage to, I think, track her down outside one of the buildings of the alchemy school. Or I think it might actually be that she spots you. Because I think you’re walking down an alley and then she just kinda, like, pokes her head through a wall and is like:
Rhi (as Tira): Oh, hey.
Kim (as Blaire): Hey, there you are.
Rhi (as Tira): I… I know you.
Kim (as Blaire): Blaire.
Rhi (as Tira): Blaire, yeah!
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, hey.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh yeah, that whole… that whole weird trial thing. Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Yup. Yup, you possessed me. You were in my body. We didn’t know how to drive.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, it was a good time.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah! Yeah, that was fun.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, we should do it again sometime.
Rhi (as Tira): Can I do it again?
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi (as Tira): Okay, like right now?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, no. No, we can’t.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh.
Kim (as Blaire): Listen, next time. I will owe you for this one. Next time we—
Rhi (as Tira): What are you owing me for? What am I… what am I doing? Is it another trial?
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, no. Not another trial.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you wanna annoy the shit out of some people?
Rhi (as Tira): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, great.
Rhi (as Tira): I mean, that’s what I’ve been doing here this whole time. It’s actually pretty fun.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! I bet it is. But I need you to annoy the shit out of people that are not here.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh. Okay, I can do that.
Kim (as Blaire): Just for a little while, and then you can go back to, you know, terrorizing Professor Dowler and…
Rhi (as Tira): [laughs] That guy’s such an ass.
Kim (as Blaire): He’s such an asshole! His grading is so subjective! I got As in all of my classes except for his. He gave me an A minus.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] I think Tira just stares at you and blinks.
Rhi (as Tira): So… okay. You know what, I’m not gonna— never mind. Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): He practically failed me!
Josie: [laughs] Oh no. We just got some insight into Blaire’s upbringing.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] So I think Tira is just kinda like:
Rhi (as Tira): Uh… okay. Well, I’ll pants him again for ya sometime.
Kim (as Blaire): Can you do something worse than pantsing? Can you like… I don’t know. Can you, like, make him choke on his tea or something?
Rhi (as Tira): I don’t know if I can do that… I could spill ink all over his gradebook?
Kim (as Blaire): That would be good. That would be really good.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Um…
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah, what did you need me to do?
Kim (as Blaire): Oh yeah.
Rhi (as Tira): You said I had to annoy somebody.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Professor Dowler, he’s another project another time. And I wanna be there where you whip his ass.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Tira): I thought you got expelled.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh yeah. Well, anyway, tell me all about it when you do it. Anyway.
Rhi (as Tira): And they say I’m the distractible one.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs] No, sorry. My friends and I, we’re trying to steal a building.
Rhi (as Tira): That’s so cool.
Kim (as Blaire): Right?
Rhi (as Tira): Are you gonna use, like, a crane to pick it up and take it away?
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs] No, no. Our plan is we need to make out like the building is haunted.
Rhi (as Tira): Uh huh.
Kim (as Blaire): And that way, the price of the building will go so, so, so freaking low. And then we’re pretending to be people who we’re not and then we’re just gonna buy the place.
Rhi (as Tira): So all I have to do is annoy somebody, though?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, because—
Rhi (as Tira): Okay! I can do it.
Kim (as Blaire): I knew you would darling, but—
Rhi (as Tira): I don’t need to know about all the real state stuff, I just need to annoy a guy?
Kim (as Blaire): Honestly, I don’t know anything about real estate either.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay. Yay!
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I needed someone like you to do this, because we don’t wanna actually haunt the place, cause we kinda need it.
Rhi (as Tira): I think that if there’s a ghost, it’s not, like, I feel like if there’s a ghost present it’s just haunted. It’s kind of like a yes or no thing.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… yeah, I guess so.
Rhi (as Tira): But I’m not gonna, like, be a mean ghost.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re not a mean ghost! You’re a sweetheart.
Rhi (as Tira): Aww, thank you.
Minna and Josie: Aww.
Rhi (as Tira): You’re very nice too.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, I’m really not, but thank you. Yeah, no, you’re not mean. You’re a good ghost.
Rhi (as Tira): Thanks.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re welcome.
Rhi (as Tira): You want me to go annoy somebody now?
Kim (as Blaire): Professor Dowler, please.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay, I’m gonna go pour ink. Where should I meet you?
Kim (as Blaire): Do you know where The Hound’s Paw is?
Rhi (as Tira): I can find it. I don’t have anything better to do with my time.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, yeah, just meet me outside there.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay. I’m gonna go pour ink all over Dowler’s gradebooks. Bye!
Kim (as Blaire): Bye, pour it on his face too.
Rhi: [laughs] She goes back into the building. Okay, Myra. You’re also in the area of Charterhall, but looking for some real estate records. Do you wanna go ahead and give me a roll of some kind for that?
Minna: Mm hmm. And I got a 6 on that.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. You very easily are able to find some paperwork indicating who owns the place. It is, we’re gonna say, Bernard Dalmore is the name of the guy. He owns the whole building in addition to the printing press. He rents out the, we’ll say, six apartments above. Any other info you would like to get while you’re digging around in the real estate records?
Minna: Is there any way in there I could find out thinks about, like, market value in the area?
Rhi: Yeah…
Minna: Or at least, like, what price he bought it.
Rhi: Oh, yeah. For sure. So, Crow’s Foot is a, you know, not great district. I’m gonna say that he bought— this is a three-story building. He probably bought this for, yeah, I’m gonna say ten coin.
Josie: Oh.
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, it’s a building.
Josie and Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: So yeah, he paid ten coin for it. He’s owned the place for several years. Anything else you would like to find out in the records, Myra?
Minna: I’m trying to think what else we could use from these records.
Rhi: I mean, if something comes up you can always, like, ask me what I have found that’s in the records.
Minna: Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind.
Rhi: So, yeah. Okay. So, Myra, you spend a couple of honestly probably pretty relaxing hours poring over some legal documents. And then, you know, you take your notes, you pack up your stuff, you head outside whatever this government building is and as you are coming down the stairs into the lobby, there is a Bluecoat squadron standing there in front of the doors.
Minna: Mm. Yes, I went into a nice area of town while extremely wanted, how dumb of me.
Rhi: And as you kinda hit the foyer, a couple of them look up and go:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Yeah, that’s her.
Rhi: And they start moving in on you.
Minna: Ahh!
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: What are you gonna do?
Josie: Oh no?
Minna: Uh… I know this building pretty well. I’m gonna try and, like, slip out the side exit or something.
Rhi: Okay. Give me a roll of some kind to try and shake them.
Minna: Mm… I don’t have any good ones on this, do I? Man. I guess it’s gonna have to be Prowl. I’ve been neglecting my Prowl skill.
Rhi: Go ahead and roll it.
Minna: I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: 6, thank God.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] So, you, yeah, tell me how you make this escape from the Bluecoats that are coming after you.
Minna: Myra, she knows that this is a dangerous place for her to come. She’s been coming here for a while, but she knows that it’s gotten ever more dangerous. So she’s been, you know, scouting out potential escape routes. She has them in her head, so she instantly knows, “Oh there’s people that way, let’s go this way.” She dives down a hallway which kinda mostly has, like, secretarial offices, and there’s a door out to an alley. She ducks out that way and then she gets up onto— there’s like a fire escape type thing, and she gets up on to that and gets onto the roof of the building next door and then goes from there.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. So I think as you scramble up onto the roof, you see several Bluecoats, like, fanning out down the alley and, you know, kinda of shouting to each other like:
Rhi (as Bluecoats): No, clear down here. No sign of her.
Minna: I think she just, kinda like, crouches down like a gargoyle, you know, behind a chimney or something.
Rhi: Yeah. You can hear them kind of shouting to each other as they’re looking for you. And you have to hang out up there probably for pretty close to an hour. You peek out every now and then and there’s still more Bluecoats around than you’re comfortable with, but eventually they disperse and you’re able to head back to the street and make your way back home. But, yeah. You know that they are pretty hot on your tails at this point, if they’re waiting for you when you’re leaving the records halls. So, how do you wanna go about—I feel like you probably need to send Tira in first and let her work for a few days to soften him up?
Josie: Yeah, probably.
Rhi: Blaire, can I have you roll me something as a setup action, I think is how we’re gonna do this.
Kim: Hmm. What would you like me to roll?
Rhi: Whatever you think would be relevant to Tira doing her dark mischief.
Kim: I’ll roll Attune, I guess.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 6 and a 5.
Rhi: With a 6, okay, I’m just gonna note that she’s been incredibly effective. She’s so annoying. Like, I feel like you all probably kind of, you know, scout the place out. You know, you check up on it over the next few days, and like, occasionally you walk by and can just see, like, the blinds rattling and you can hear muffled shouting from inside. At one point there’s definitely, like, a tornado of paper happening in the middle of the room that you can see through the glass on the door. It’s just, it’s a lot. Let’s do the engagement roll as you all are approaching. 3d6 engagement roll, which is pretty good.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: So, I will roll this. Huh.
Josie: We got a 1, didn’t we?
Rhi: No. It’s three 3s.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: [strained] Great.
Rhi: [laughs] I rolled 3d6 and every last one of them came up a 3.
Minna: Clearly, we’re destined to have a 3.
Rhi: Yeah. So, this is, I assume… this is pretty clearly a deception score.
Josie: Uh huh.
Rhi: I do not see what else it could be. You’re in a desperate position. A desperate position on this would be…
Josie: I have a proposition?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. Hit me.
Josie: Some Spirit Wardens got here before us.
Rhi: [gasps] Yes! That’s so good. Oh my God.
Kim: Noooo, Tira!
Rhi: Yes, yes, yes, perfect. Love it. Okay. Okay. So, the three of you are walking down the street looking— I don’t know if I’d say cool, but confident. You’re ready to go in and you know that Tira has been super obnoxious, this guy probably just wants to get out of this situation. Things are going great. You turn the corner, and there is the signature dark blue and brass carriage of the Spirit Wardens pulled by a pair of Hulls that are vaguely horse-shaped. And Hulls are, for our listening audience, I don’t know that we’ve actually had any appear yet. They are kind of clockwork machines that are powered by spirits.
Kim (as Blaire): Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Rhi: And they are parked outside.
Josie: Hold on. Only humans make ghosts, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: So that means they’ve got human spirits, at least of some awareness, bound into a horse shape.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Josie (as Minx): And they’re using— that is fucked up.
Rhi: Yeah. Hulls are really messed up.
Josie: Like, do we know if they shove a bunch of spirits into these things, or is it just like one?
Rhi: It’s a one-to-one. One Hull gets one spirit.
Minna: Fucking horrific, though.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: Jeez.
Rhi: And like, the process of putting a spirit into a Hull, let me find the exact description of it in here.
Minna: Oh no.
Kim: Oh joy. I learn new things about this setting every game.
Rhi: So you can, like, Hull is an available playbook.
Kim: Whoa!
Josie: Uh huh.
Kim: That’s cool, actually.
Rhi: If you d— yeah, it is. So, for Hulls, they way they work, they are a spirit animating a sparkcraft frame. You have become a pale echo of your living self, trapped in a mechanical body, forced into servitude.
Kim: So, a droid.
Rhi: Pretty much, yeah. They are automatons. Your former human feelings, interests and connections are only dim memories. You now exist to fulfil your functions. So, the process of putting a spirit into a hull strips out pretty much whatever remaining personality they may have had and just sort of binds them to service.
Josie: How does anyone like these guys?
Rhi: Uh, because they keep ghosts from eating everyone and—
Kim: They’re basically pest control.
Rhi: Yeah. To the people of the city, ghosts are scarier. And nine times out of ten, that’s correct. [laughs] Most of the time, ghosts will eat your whole face and then your soul. Anyway, so you all have gotten here, the Spirit Wardens have gotten here before you. What are you gonna do?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, we’ve gotta make sure Tira’s okay.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, that takes priority here.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m gonna look for her.
Kim: Um—
Josie (as Minx): Here’s the thing, if we lose this opportunity, then we lose this opportunity. We need to make sure she’s okay.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna put on her spirit mask and I suppose I’m gonna roll Attune for the umpteenth time tonight.
Rhi: Yes. And you are in a desperate position, so you’ll mark XP for this.
Kim: Oh, cool. Oh no! Okay. That’s a— heh. I take the highest, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: That’s a 2.
Josie: Oh no!
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Woo, what the fuck happened?
Kim: I don’t know!
Rhi: So, you’re able to see Tira. In a jar.
Josie: [inhales]
Minna: No!
Kim: No.
Rhi: In the hands of one of the spirit wardens.
Kim: No!
Rhi: It’s the worst— literally, what it says for if you roll a 1 to a 3 on desperate, it’s the worst outcome. They’ve already caught her.

"Season 3, Episode 4: The Haunted Press Score, Part 2 Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly.
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. If you haven’t left us a review yet, please do so. We love reviews. Every time we get a nice one, and they’re almost all nice, I share it with the rest of the cast and then we all yell a lot. And even better than our excited yelling, more reviews help new listeners find the show.
In case you missed it, we broke 100,000 downloads last week, which unlocked the Whitehollow worldbuilding bonus episode. If I had the time, I’d run a whole separate Blades campaign in our version of the city. Josie, Kim and Minna came up with some incredible ideas. Recording the bonus episode was a ton of fun, so go check it out if you haven’t yet.
We are just a few patrons short of unlocking the Magpie pin giveaway for our backers. When we reach 100 active backers on Patreon, all of those backers will be entered in a drawing to win one of five Magpies pins created and painted by James Bricknell, the designer of our Magpies pins models. If you can’t do a monthly Patreon payment but still want a pin, visit our Shapeways store to buy one of your own.
A few months ago, I recorded a guest episode on the Roll Out podcast. I got to play Brie Sheldon’s game Turn, which is about shapeshifters in small-town America. It was a really charming, fun game in which I played a baker who sometimes turned into a bear. The episode will be going up this week, so visit the Roll Out website linked in the show notes.
Next, Minna is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Minna: This month we are spotlighting Planned Parenthood. They provide reproductive services from birth control and STD screening to abortions. They also provide education and are working to fight abortion bans across the nation. I strongly believe that everybody has the right to whatever reproductive services and choices they want. If you would like to support Planned Parenthood, you can go to their website at PlannedParenthood.org and click the donate button. Or, you could find a local organization and support them as well, that is also great.
Rhi: As always, please continue to visit sites like 5calls.org for scripts for contacting your representatives about the many, many issues facing the US today. And if you, like many of use, are completely overwhelmed by the impeachment news, I recommend visiting Impeachment.FYI and subscribing to their email newsletter. It’s a good way to keep up with what’s happening without getting lost in the minute-to-minute updates. And as we approach Thanksgiving in the US, take this opportunity to find ways to support and uplift the voices of Indigenous people wherever you live. One of our charities earlier this year was the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center. It’s a good place to begin.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [00.03.15]
Rhi: So, you’re able to see Tira. In a jar.
Josie: [inhales]
Minna: No!
Kim: No.
Rhi: In the hands of one of the Spirit Wardens.
Kim: No!
Rhi: It’s the worst— literally, what it says for if you roll a 1 to a 3 on desperate, it’s the worst outcome. They’ve already caught her.
Kim (as Blaire): No. No. No, no, no, not her. Not her. Shit! Shit. Shit, this…
Josie: Before I state more actions.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: We’ve never contemplated this possibility before. How does one fail a score?
Rhi: You just bail on it.
Josie: You just bail on it.
Rhi: If you just decide we’re not, we can’t do it, yeah, you just bail on the score. You don’t get any of the rewards.
Josie: Like, I just wanna like check in with everyone beforehand that like, that might just be what we do. The score is now get Tira out.
Minna: Yeah, agreed.
Kim: It has to be.
Minna: We don’t sacrifice someone’s, like, personhood for our goals.
Josie: Right.
Kim: Yeah, no. No ghost left behind.
Josie: This was supposed to be low fuckin’ stakes, now they’re suddenly real high.
Rhi: [laughs] For what it’s worth—
Josie: I did suggest this.
Rhi: This was your idea. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, so Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): [sobs]
Josie: Minx is gonna put a hand in Blaire’s hair.
Josie (as Minx): We’re going to fix this. We’re going to save her.
Kim (as Blaire): How? How are we going to fix this?
Josie (as Minx): We need to think quickly.
Kim (as Blaire): We can’t.
Josie (as Minx): Where will they be heading once they leave here?
Rhi: Back to Bellweather crematorium, where they have the equipment to destroy spirits.
Josie: What bridges do they need to cross to get there?
Rhi: Ooh. Good question.
Minna: I was gonna ask the same thing, because we do that a lot.
Rhi: [laughs] Let me look at the map here. There are two bridges they could potentially take from Crow’s Foot into Charterhall.
Josie: Okay.
Minna: Is there a way we could, like, see which way they start heading?
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, they are— so like, right now, Blaire I think when you looked into the ghost field you were able to see that there are— there’s three Spirit Wardens present. And they’re all inside. The carriage is unattended.
Josie (as Minx): I think we need to disable their carriage first things first.
Kim (as Blaire): [weakly] How are we going to do that?
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, do you think you can, with being minimally seen, mess with their wheels?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm. I… I don’t know. I just wanna get her out!
Josie (as Minx): We will.
Kim (as Blaire): This wasn’t supposed to happen and it’s my fault.
Minna (as Myra): You asked her to take a risk and she took it willingly.
Kim (as Blaire): No. [sobs] The Reconciled are gonna kill me.
Minna (as Myra): The Reconciled are not going to kill you, because we’re going to help her. As long as we pull ourselves together and get this done.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): We need to concentrate on the task at hand. We can fall apart later.
Kim (as Blaire): [stammers]
Josie (as Minx): Blaire. Please.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra…
Josie (as Minx): Myra, are you a skilled enough tinkerer to disable it?
Minna (as Myra): I’m not skilled, but I can certainly try.
Josie (as Minx): Please do.
Rhi: You also, I will point out, there are the Hulls. Can probably do something there.
Minna: I do have two dots in Attune. Maybe it would be better to attempt something with the Hulls?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, just disable the carriage however you’re able.
Minna: Yes, I think Myra’s going to try.
Kim: Would you like an assist?
Minna: Oh, this could be really cute as an assist, though.
Rhi: Yeah. So, Blaire will take a point of stress.
Minna: I rolled a 5.
Rhi: Tell me what this looks like.
Minna: I think that we work together and… uh, what are we trying to get them to do? I think we look into the ghost field and we see how these Hulls are put together and maybe try to communicate with the spirits inside. Although I guess all their sense of personhood is gone, isn’t it?
Rhi: Pretty much. There’s not a ton left.
Josie: Or— they’re bound to a sense of purpose, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: And their purpose is to pull carriage. Tell them to pull carriage. [laughs]
Rhi: If you’re just looking to get this carriage out of the way, telling them to do their job would be an effective way of doing it.
Kim: Blaire spanks one of their butts.
Rhi: [laughs] They’re made of metal.
Josie and Kim: Thunk!
[laughter]
Rhi: Okay, so I think what happens— I’m gonna go with you do it at reduced effect. The two of you kind of combined reach into the ghost field. Myra is able to sort of give this command of, you know—
Minna (as Myra): Giddy up!
Rhi: And the Hulls start trotting along, but they don’t go very fast and they don’t go very far because they can tell that there’s not, like, a driver. So, it gets about a block away and then they just kinda slow down and stop. So, it’s no longer right out front, but they also didn’t go very far.
Minna: That still gives us space to set up an ambush between here and the carriage.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I’m thinking at least I hide in the carriage. Because we need to have that moment, right? [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, so if you all set up your ambush down closer to where the carriage is?
Josie and Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: They get into the carriage, Minx sticks a gun in their face, or whatever, and then we come in, we close in from both sides and box them in.
Rhi: Okay. So, yeah, the three of you get into your ambush positions and you wait. You don’t have to wait too long. So, you’re keeping an eye out down the street. You see one of the Spirit Wardens step outside and then just stop and like, look around. And then, you know, you can see, like, pointing down the street and there’s a little bit of conversation amongst the three of them, and then they just kind of start walking down the street. As to what Spirit Wardens look like. Spirit Wardens are completely anonymous. Nobody knows who is a member. People who join the Spirit Wardens are never posted in the city that they’re from, so all of Duskwall’s Spirit Wardens are from other places in the Empire.
Josie: Weird.
Rhi: They wear, all of them, like the uniform, is a dark blue coat with brass buttons. They wear dark blue gloves, hoods, and face-concealing brass masks. So, they all, other than, you know, fairly slight variations in height and weight, it is kind of impossible to tell them apart. There are rumors that, like, people get recruited to the Spirit Wardens based on how closely they fit sort of the average shape. It’s… yeah. It’s very creepy. So, the three of them start walking in your direction. So, I think as they approach, they kinda slow down and start looking around. Body language seems suspicious. One of them has the ghost jar tucked under their arm, but the other two start going for their weapons. They have lightning hooks like what Blaire carries. So, they are pulling weapons and they are looking suspicious of the situation. They don’t know exactly where the three of you are, but they suspect that something is afoot. Their Hulls don’t usually just runoff on their own.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, yeah. The three of them are cautiously approaching the carriage. What do you all wanna do?
Josie: I wanna remain hidden in the carriage until one of them pops the door open.
Rhi: Okay. That happens. One of them opens the door.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: But it’s not— I think it’s not a, like, just kind of a slow, casual open. It’s the, like, yank the door open really fast.
Josie: That is fine, because I would like to make a case for using my Cloak and Dagger move here. Because Minx has, while in the carriage, let her hair down, torn off her cumbersome jacket, and has readied her cane sword.
Minna: Minx is in stabby mode. I love it.
Josie: Yep, she’s in stabby mode. And I kinda wanna make the case here that since I’m casting off my disguise and my hiding place in a sudden fashion, that the resulting surprise gives me the initiative in the situation?
Rhi: I’ll allow it. I can see you, like, the door whips open and this guy gets this incredible jacket just thrown in his face. [laughs]
Josie: Yes, exactly. Just poof!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: This is going to be risky, we’re gonna say.
Josie: I am going to make my Skirmish roll first and then describe it, depending on how that turns out.
Rhi: Yeah. Are you gonna push yourself or Devil’s Bargain or anything?
Josie: Oh yes, I am gonna push myself in order to engage a small gang on equal footing with no reduced effect. And also gain an extra die.
Rhi: Oh. Alright.
Josie: Because I have Not To Be Trifled With.
Rhi: Yeah. Oh yeah. That’s definitely the time to use that.
Josie: Got a 5.
Rhi: Describe what you do.
Josie: Fuckin’ leap out the door and tackle him to the ground. Just like pin his shoulders back down to the pavement with my knees and have my sword in both hands just right above him ready to plunge already.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Is he the one with the ghost jar?
Rhi: No.
Josie: He’s not?
Rhi: He does not have it.
Josie: Yeah, in that case— the Spirit Wardens don’t seem to be the kinda sort who’s like, “Oh, if our teammate is threatened we’ll give it up,” right? These are some dedicated anonymous individuals.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: In that case I think Minx isn’t gonna kill him, but she wants to ram her sword down through his shoulder or chest or something, to like pin him with the sword blade.
Rhi: You can definitely do that, I think probably through the shoulder or bicep, and then the blade goes into the gaps in the cobblestones, yeah. You can definitely do that.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: There’s kind of a muffled screech from behind the mask, because no matter how stoic and well-trained you are, that shit hurts.
Josie: Right. [laughs]
Rhi: But you got a 5, so there is a consequence. And I think that the consequence is gonna be that one of the other Spirit Wardens just swings the lightning hook straight into your back, and you’re gonna take level 2 harm, Electrocuted.
Josie: Uh, I can resist that, right?
Rhi: Yes you can.
Josie: I’m gonna Prowess resist that.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Nope! [laughs]
Rhi: Oof, okay. So, you’re gonna— well, no, no. You will take three stress, but it will drop it down to level 1 harm.
Josie: Oh, okay.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Sweet.
Rhi: So, the other two of you have seen this happen. Minx tackled this guy, stabbed him in the arm, got lightly zapped. What are you doing?
Kim: I mean, besides screaming?
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Screaming is a free action.
[laughter]
Kim: It is a free action.
Rhi: So’s crying. [laughs] Yeah, so who’s doing what?
Minna: Um, I think we’re closing on the— or at least, I’m closing in on one of the other Bluecoats. Or—
Rhi: Spirit Wardens.
Minna: Spirit Wardens. You know what I mean. [laughs] They also wear blue coats!
Rhi: Yeah. There’s an aesthetic amongst the authority figures of Duskwall. Which one are you going after? The one that swung— so basically, of the remaining two, you’ve got guy, or person, who swung at Minx and person holding spirit jar.
Minna: Person holding spirit jar.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Because really, if we can get that spirit jar smashed, slash open, we are done here.
Rhi: Yeah. I will say, the spirit jars are designed to be difficult to just break. It’s not like if you drop a jar that you would use for food.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: They’re a lot sturdier than that. Not impossible, but it’s not like, oh, if it gets dropped it’ll instantly shatter.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, what are you doing to this person?
Minna: Uh, I think this is a Skirmish?
Rhi: Yeah. You got some kind of equipment that you’re using?
Minna: Yeah. I think this is an unusual weapon. My baton that I’ve had in the past.
Rhi: Oh yeah, yeah. Your truncheon?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Cool, yeah. Go for it.
Minna: Oof. Double twos. This does not go well for me.
Rhi: Oh… yeah, that’s risky. I think you do hit this person, but you kinda like hit them on the shoulder and they have, like, their coats are armored, so it doesn’t really do anything. And the one holding the spirit jar has been, like, fiddling at their pocket. And they pull out a flare gun and fire it. And we’re starting a clock for Bluecoats Arrive.
Kim: No!
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: And it is at 1 out of 4. So, that’s happening. Blaire, what are you gonna do?
Kim: Alright, so I’m gonna go after the one holding the spirit jar.
Rhi: Okay. Gonna lightning hook at him?
Kim: Yeah, I’m just trying to figure out what to roll for that. Is it Skirmish?
Rhi: Probably.
Kim: Yeah, I’ll just roll Skirmish.
Rhi: Alright. Do you wanna push yourself, Devil’s Bargain?
Kim: Yeah, no, I’m just gonna push myself for the extra dice.
Rhi: Alright. Nobody takes Devil’s Bargains anymore.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Gee, I wonder why!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: I didn’t even have to offer a Devil’s Bargain to get you into this situation, you did it yourselves.
Kim: Okay, good, that’s a 6.
Rhi: You… yeah, I assume you are aiming for the face?
Kim: Oh yeah.
Rhi: You slam the lightning hook into this guy’s face and, you know, electricity kinda crackles out. It’s not as effective as you would think. It, like, it definitely hurts them. They’re in pain.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: And they kinda stumble back a little bit, but it seems like some of the kind of electroplasmic energy, electricity gets almost absorbed by the mask. Which is a little weird.
Josie: Although apparently brass is actually not a super good conductor.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Well, it’s also their masks are all spirit masks.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, they’re also a bit already kinda of occult.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: You put them off balance. They still have a hold on the jar, but they’ve dropped the flare gun and they haven’t managed to draw a weapon of their own yet.
Kim: Oh, good.
Rhi: So, Minx, you’ve got a person pinned to the ground with a sword.
Josie: And someone behind me who just zapped me.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Whenever Blaire uses them, it’s described as lightning “hooks”, so I always imagine one in each hand. Is that the same for these guys?
Rhi: I think that the ones that they have are closer to the description in the book. Because I imagine you can kinda do these however you want. But for them, it’s like a long pole that has a loop of wire at the end, and that wire is what carries the charge. I picture what Blaire has is more of, like, smaller hand-held versions of that, with the loops, with capacitators in both hands.
Josie: Gotcha. Oh, so there’s a wire there and I have a sword.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: The wire is carrying a charge, yeah.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: And your sword is stuck in somebody.
Josie: In that case, I want to, I kinda wanna roll off the guy I’m pinning and knock the other guy to the ground.
Rhi: Okay. Just, so another tackle?
Josie: Yeah, and wrestle the lightning hook away from him.
Rhi: Okay. This is gonna be risky.
Josie: Okey dokey.
Rhi: And I think reduced effect, because they are— I should have been saying that earlier, I was kinda doing this all at reduced effect, because they’re a much higher Tier than all of you.
Josie: I am not gonna push myself again here, so I’ll just eat that reduced effect. What does a Devil’s Bargain look like here?
Rhi: Ooh, alright! Uh… the guy that you pinned is going to himself unpinned.
Minna: [gasps] Oof.
Rhi: He’s gonna just yank the sword out of his arm and start getting up. But he’s not gonna be able to act immediately while you’re doing this, but he is gonna be able to get up. Like, you’re not actively sitting on him, so he’s going to extricate himself from the sword and the ground.
Josie: You know what? I am reckless. I think I’m gonna take that Devil’s Bargain.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: 5 again.
Rhi: Yeah, you tackle this other Spirit Warden. What was your goal with, like, you just wanna take him to the ground?
Josie: Yeah, I wanna disable him, pretty much.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you take him down. I think that you’re both kind of wrestling over the lightning hook. Bluecoats Arrive, 2 out of 4.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Myra or Blaire?
Minna: I’m going for this person with the jar again. I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I don’t know if this should be for increased effect or for another die.
Rhi: Oh yeah. I dunno, it’s up to you.
Minna: Let’s go ahead and take a gamble and do it for increased effect.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: God dammit. [sighs] It’s a 2 again.
Rhi: Oh man.
Kim: [groans] Why have the dice gods abandoned us?
Minna: They’ve been very nice to us recently.
Rhi: Yeah. It was time.
Minna: Also, we decided to take on the Spirit Wardens.
Rhi: Yeah. Do you want harm or do you want the Bluecoats to get closer?
Kim: Take one for the team?
[laughter]
Minna: Yeah, I’m gonna take harm. But I am gonna resist it.
Rhi: So, I think you, like, move in to try and grab the jar, and this person goes into their pocket and comes out with something that’s about the size of Blaire’s lightning hooks, but it has— it’s basically a taser. [laughs] And just jams it into your side.
Kim: Oof.
Minna: What is that to start with?
Rhi: Level 2. Also Electrocuted. It’s kinda how the Spirit Wardens operate.
Minna: So, that was a 5, so I take 1 stress and it’s gonna be level 1, Electrocuted, right?
Rhi: Zapped.
Minna: Zapped.
Rhi: Because you’re not fully electrocuted. But yeah, level 1 harm. So, reduced effect on—
Minna: I feel like I’ve had this before. [laughs]
Rhi: Yes, you all get electrocuted a lot actually. You get shot a lot and you get electrocuted a lot.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Not a lot of stabbing, surprisingly.
Kim: The fuck do I do?
Rhi: Yeah, this person is still holding Tira in a jar. Just zapped Myra real good.
Kim: I mean, I’m tempted to whip out a gun, but I have nothing in Hunt. And that would be a bad idea.
Rhi: You could do— at this range you could do Skirmish. You’re basically firing at point blank range.
Kim: Okay. So let me mark off a pistol.
Rhi: Also.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: You could shoot the Spirit Warden, or you could try shooting the jar.
Minna: [gasps] Yes, yes, yes!
Rhi: Because a bullet, unless you’re using an electroplasmic bullet, that’s not gonna hurt the ghost. And I do not think Blaire would ever carry electroplasmic bullets.
Kim: No.
Rhi: Because those are designed for ghost hunting.
Minna: Interesting.
Rhi: Yeah, so like, if you just manage to shoot the jar—
Minna: Hold up. People shoot ghosts with bullets?
Rhi: Yeah, that’s a thing that the Hound has.
Minna: I love it.
Rhi: The Hound has electroplasmic bullets.
Minna: It’s so beautiful.
Rhi: It’s real good. It’s real good. This is a good game.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: I don’t know why I thought those were for like, Deathlands beasties or something. [laughs] Nope, ghosts.
Rhi: For shootin’ ghosts. Yeah, so Kim, what are you doing?
Kim: I mean, I have to believe that busting out Tira would give us the best odds, right?
Rhi: I mean, that is your goal right now. Once Tira is free, you all can run.
Kim: True. Alright, so I’ll shoot the jar.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: And you said Skirmish is okay?
Rhi: Yes. Skirmish will be fine because you’re doing it at pretty close range. It’s still gonna be risky, reduced effect.
Minna: Can I give an assist? Like, I distract?
Rhi: You absolutely—
Kim: Please?
Rhi: Absolutely can.
Kim: Thank you.
Rhi: Blaire, do you want a Devil’s Bargain? Push yourself?
Kim: I’d be interested in a Devil’s Bargain.
Rhi: Tira is not gonna really trust you as much after this.
Kim: No. Denied. No.
Rhi: Alright. Risky, reduced effect.
Kim: [laughs nervously]
Minna: What did you roll? How bad?
Kim: I rolled two 3s.
Minna: No, not again!
Josie: Come on! [laughs]
Rhi: So, you fire that shot and it goes wide. And the Bluecoats are at 3 out of 4.
Kim: [grimaces] No. Don’t like that.
Rhi: Yep. Alright. Minx, the guy that you had pinned is standing up and has your sword.
Josie: I want to try to yank the lightning hook away from the guy I’m wrestling for it and zap the guy who now has my sword.
Rhi: Alright. I believe that is indeed still a Skirmish.
Josie: And I think I just gotta roll flat on this one.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: Gotta spare some stress here. Devil’s Bargains aren’t looking good right now.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: 4.
Rhi: Definitely a 4.
Josie: Uh huh. [laughs] Triple 4.
Rhi: You get the lightning hook away from the guy and you zap the other Spirit Warden. I think that the zapping causes him to drop the sword, but it doesn’t take him out of commission.
Josie: Right, because they’re kind of insulated.
Rhi: The guy that you were wrestling with gets you in like a chokehold and is trying to choke you into unconsciousness. You hope into unconsciousness.
Josie: That sucks. [laughs]
Rhi: He’s trying to choke you out. So, you’re in a desperate position.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: Myra?
Minna: [laughs] Um…
Rhi: [laughs] Listen, the dice have turned in a very real way.
Minna: Yes, how the turntables… I don’t know what to do! I’m going to try something with Attune.
Kim and Rhi: Oh?
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Yeah, maybe something like try and summon something? Maybe one of the Hulls. One of the spirits from the Hulls. To help me.
Rhi: Worth a shot, yeah. Okay.
Minna: 6. [relieved sigh]
Rhi: Hoo, okay.
Josie: Nice.
Minna: Still probably gonna be reduced effect because Spirit Wardens, but…
Rhi: I think you’re only able, like, you can’t get them both. You can get one.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: But you can do what you want with it, yeah.
Minna: And I think what I do is that I trip that command and I turn it towards the Spirit Warden holding the jar. And I have it charge.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, watch out!
Kim (as Blaire): Aah!
Minna: And then, like, something flares in the ghost field.
Rhi: And I think that this, even though you didn’t catch the second one, it just sort of follows the other’s lead. And yeah, this Warden was not expecting that and gets ploughed over. And I think that does cause him to drop the jar. It doesn’t shatter.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire.
Kim: Yep, I grab it.
Rhi: Okay. You’ve got the jar. You can hear the bells from the Bluecoat wagons are they’re approaching.
Josie: I think it’s time to leave.
Kim: Yeah, I guess we’d better run.
Josie: I mean, I’m in a chokehold, but… [laughs]
Rhi: Oh yeah, yeah. You’re gonna have to roll something to get out of that.
Josie: Yeah. Did they ever tell you in, like, self-defense classes what to do in this situation?
Rhi: Uh, yeah. You go for like, elbow them in the solar plexus.
Josie: Yeah. I mean, there’s that, or am I able— okay, what I was taught is that if people of a certain body type are doing it—
Rhi: Ah. [laughs]
Josie: You slam your hand down there, grab and twists as hard as you fucking can.
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: Uh huh. That would do the trick, yeah. [laughs]
Kim: Fucking do it.
Josie: [laughs] Okay then. I’m gonna try and do that. Um, this is less dice, but I feel like this is a Wreck.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. Go for it.
Kim: Yeah, it is.
Minna: Absolutely.
Rhi: It is gonna be desperate.
Josie: Uh huh. [laughs]
Rhi: So mark XP for it.
Josie: [laughs] I could push myself to use Not To Be Trifled With to perform a feat a physical force that borders on superhuman.
Rhi: Yes!
Kim: Yeah!
Minna: [laughs and claps]
Rhi: Do it.
Josie: Doing it. And increasing my die. Got a 6.
Kim: Oh my God!
Rhi: I think what we see is this guy has Minx in a chokehold. You know, you’re both still struggling. Minx twists an arm down back behind herself and then there’s just this blood-curdling scream as she [laughs] does something very terrible to this guy’s nether regions. You are released! [laughs] You are released because he’s fallen onto his back and is curling into the fetal position.
Josie: [laughs] Yes!
Rhi: So, you’re free. The other two, I think you are— one of them got run down, I think the guy— Minx, I think you’re losing another cane sword. [laughs]
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Because that guy still has it.
Josie: Fine. Yep.
Rhi: And yeah, but the three of you can book it at this point. You can run for safety.
Josie: Yeah. Book it, yelling for a Cabbie or a Gondolier or something.
Rhi: Yeah. I think you can, like, sprint across the bridge. I think you pick the south bridge and you can see, up the river a little ways, the Bluecoats tearing across the north bridge.
Josie: Uh huh. [laughs]
Rhi: But you’re able to get across and then run down and have a Gondolier carry you away to safety. Alright, so you did not accomplish your goal, but you did rescue a spirit from destruction.
Kim: Phew.
Rhi: So, you accomplished a goal, even if it wasn’t what you originally set out to do. So, for downtime, you’re not gonna get any coin. A shocking twist. You’re also not gonna get any rep, because your rep meter is full.
Josie: But we’re probably getting heat. [laughs]
Rhi: Uh, yeah.
Minna: [whines]
Rhi: Loud and chaotic, high exposure. Actually, I think it might just be 4.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Somebody might wanna spend some time taking that down a bit, cause you are at—
Minna: I will do that, for sure.
Rhi: Yeah. Heat 6, Wanted level 3. So, if you get to wanted level 4, you’re just going to have the Bluecoats breathing down your neck.
Minna: Yeah… no thanks. No thanks. I don’t want this.
Rhi: Okay. So, let’s do our downtime scenes. Let’s start with Myra.
Minna: Gonna go to Minx. So, I think she, like, catches Minx. Honestly, I think it’s sometime late at night, like when Minx is coming in or something. She’s like:
Minna (as Myra): Hey, I actually had something I’ve been meaning to ask you.
Josie (as Minx): Oh?
Minna (as Myra): I know you went with me to the Devil’s Tooth that one time. Unfortunately, I’ve not felt safe going there for a little while. I was wondering if you knew anybody who might be able to provide supplies? Um, so that I can…
Josie (as Minx): Oh! Oh, I see. I know well the feeling of seeking a new… purveyor.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Exactly that. I don’t feel safe doing this outside the home anymore.
Josie (as Minx): Let me think. It’s bene a long time since I’ve really partaken to any degree. Let me think… oh. [snaps fingers] I think Bryl may be able to help you. Bryl is good people, although we are two puzzle pieces who don’t fit together.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Well…
Josie (as Minx): Are you sure you’re comfortable seeking something new? You would be safest here.
Minna (as Myra): That’s the plan. To be here. I just need— I mean, obviously I don’t have access to what I usually partake in at the moment, because I was letting Mistress Kember find that for me. So, I haven’t— I’m pretty out of practice with locating it.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, yeah. Well, fortunately when I partake we are of slightly similar taste, and Bryl can mix that up for you. I’m glad you are able to talk about it. You used to say nothing of what you did with your downtime.
Minna (as Myra): Things have changed.
Josie (as Minx): That they have.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] And, you know, if you can’t trust your crew, who can you trust?
Josie (as Minx): Truer words have never been spoken.
Josie: And I think Minx at that point—
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] Yeah.
Rhi: On that heartwarming note, you head off to meet a drug dealer.
Josie: Yep.
Minna: It’s the weirdest shit to be roleplaying, as I have absolutely no idea how that actually works.
Josie: I have some thoughts on Bryl that I came up with just now.
Rhi: Mm hmm. Yeah.
Josie: The reason Minx thinks highly of them but also doesn’t want to hang out with them is because Bryl is good people, in fact they are probably very sympathetic to The Magpies’ cause. They are very socially aware, kind of on anarchist, like, very anti-authority. And they are very outspoken and very particular who they perceive to be sell-outs or the like. And Minx is very ostentatious and the like, so they’re constantly kind of coming down on Minx for, like, not really getting with it and selling out and…
Minna: God, so they probably like Myra because she appears austere.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Minx, like, agrees with them but is also just sorta like…
Rhi: “But I like nice things!”
Josie: Yes. It’s kind of like putting two same sides of a magnet together, there’s just tension.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: And no one can really help it.
Rhi: Yeah, I like that. Um, okay, Minx. What are you doing with your downtime? Other than introducing Myra to a new friend?
Josie: Like, I think during that scene and pretty much any to follow, it’s very clear that Minx is wearing a lot more bandages than usual.
Minna: Oh!
Rhi: Mm.
Josie: And is kind of like, wearing more clothes that cover that up a bit. Like, I think the simplest thing is that Minx is just very clearly losing herself in packing.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Josie: Like, to compensate, she’s going full-bore Minx. She’s really unstable between, kind of like, Minx and Ellie and all the violence. So, it’s almost like unbearable in The Nest for a little bit.
Rhi: Being the most Minx that she can be.
Josie: There is presently way too much luggage to reasonably travel with. The days until the trip are gonna have to be spent paring it down.
Rhi: [laughs] And Blaire?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. Where are you at with Tira?
Kim: That’s a good question. I take her back to our place and I open her up in my room.
Rhi: Yeah, you can do that. We’ve established that spirit jars can safely move through the wards.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: So, yeah.
Kim: So I open her up.
Rhi (as Tira): [screams]
Kim (as Blaire): [yelps] Are you okay?
Rhi (as Tira): [shudders]
Kim (as Blaire): I’m sorry.
Rhi (as Tira): That was… I don’t like that!
Kim (as Blaire): I know. I’m really sorry.
Rhi (as Tira): Where are we?
Kim (as Blaire): This is my room. This is where I live.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh. Who are you?
Kim (as Blaire): Blaire.
Rhi (as Tira): Right. Right, right, right. Right. Right. Blaire. Um… yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Listen. You… I’m so sorry what happened. This wasn’t supposed to happen.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. Yeah, I don’t think it was. You were trying to… I don’t even remember. I guess it’s not important.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you okay?
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m okay. Hey, a quick question?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh huh?
Rhi (as Tira): Do you remember my name?
Minna: [gasps]
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah… your name is Tira.
Rhi (as Tira): Tira… Tira, Tira. Yeah. That sounds right.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Listen, you should really go back to The Reconciled and just stay with them for a while. They’ll be able to help you, okay? And they’ll be able to let you hang onto everything that you still remember. I really think you should go.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): And I won’t ask you for anything ever again, I promise. I’m not going to do this to you again.
Rhi (as Tira): Well, I mean, I don’t mind helping!
Kim (as Blaire): But you almost got destroyed because of me. And I don’t know what I would have done to myself if that happened.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh, well don’t… it’s not your fault. Unless you called the Spirit Wardens, and I’m pretty sure you didn’t. I think that guy that I was bothering did.
Kim (as Blaire): Listen, Tira, just go to The Reconciled and tell them that you’re starting to forget more and more things and they’ll be able to help you stay who you are. Okay? Please do that for me.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. Okay. Um, can you tell me how to get there?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, yeah. You know what? I’ll walk you there. We’ll go together, okay?
Rhi (as Tira): Okay.
Rhi: So, yeah. She’ll go with you.
Kim: While they’re walking, Blaire’s just gonna make conversation and just try to help her remember as much as she can.
Minna: [sighs] Buddy.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, she was never super together, and the experience of getting jarred up did not help matters. So, yeah. But yeah, you talking to her seems to jog some of her memories. It’s a little hard to tell if she’s remembering or if she’s just like, “Oh, okay, I’ll believe what you’re telling me.”
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: But yeah, you get her to kind of the Reconciled base and…
Kim (as Blaire): Listen, just stay here, okay?
Rhi (as Tira): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m serious. Like, I don’t know how much more of yourself you’re going to lose if something like this ever happens to you again, and I don’t wanna see that happen to you, okay?
Rhi (as Tira): Okay. I’ll stay here. Because I don’t want you to be sad.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: And she kind of does, like, the ghost version of booping you on the nose.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re not mad at me?
Rhi (as Tira): It wasn’t your fault.
Kim (as Blaire): No, Tira. It kind of was. This wouldn’t have happened to you if I hadn’t asked.
Rhi (as Tira): I mean, you don’t know that. I think I was bothering a lot of people before. Oh! Oh! I remember, I remember!
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah? Yeah? What do you—
Rhi (as Tira): I poured a bottle of ink all over that professor you didn’t like.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks, Tira.
Rhi (as Tira): I poured it all over his head. He was really mad.
Kim (as Blaire): I think going out with a bang, you know, messing with Charterhall was probably for the best.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. I’m gonna go talk to your friends now.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. They’ll be able to help you. Listen to everything that they tell you, okay?
Rhi (as Tira): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Be good, yeah?
Rhi: She kinda like thinks about it for a second and is like:
Rhi (as Tira): Mm… no promises.
Rhi: And then goes inside.
Kim (as Blaire): I love you.
Rhi: Aww…
Josie (as Minx): Aww!
Minna: [whines]
Josie: Ow.
Rhi: So, Blaire, I think you make your way back across town to The Nest, parts of which are just like, it looks like Minx’s room exploded. There’s just clothes everywhere. Myra, what are you doing in the midst of all this packing?
Minna: [laughs] I think she’s like… it doesn’t take much for her to pack, so it’s not going to take her long. I think she’s mostly continuing to narrow down her location and, you know, do research and planning about the city and how to get there. She finally is like:
Minna (as Myra): So, I’ve got a more precise location within Whitehollow, and I think we’d better be getting there sooner rather than later. Between, you know, wanting to get ahead of The Circle, but also The Bluecoats have been getting more and more troublesome lately.
Josie (as Minx): Quite.
Minna (as Myra): The other day, when I was researching for that heist that went spectacularly wrong up in Charterhall, which, I know we shouldn’t be going up to Charterhall, but that’s where the records are kept, some Bluecoats came looking for me specifically in the hall of records.
Josie (as Minx): What? They are actively hunting us then.
Minna (as Myra): Certainly. And I made a pretty narrow escape. So, you know, it would not be a bad idea to get away from them for a little bit. If nothing else, just— you ever feel kind of suffocated here?
Josie (as Minx): I know exactly what you mean.
Josie: She has two suitcases. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): When do we leave?
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Well, I can get us tickets probably pretty soon. We’ll wanna be careful about which one take and how crowded with people who might recognize us it might be. But, yeah, I’m pretty sure we can get out of here soon.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Finally, I have the opportunity to travel in style. You have no idea how long I’ve been preparing for this day, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): Have you— we’ve been over this, I’ve never travelled outside the city and you’ve never travelled outside the city, so I would say however many years you have been alive is how long you’ve been preparing for this.
Josie (as Minx): Precisely.
[laughter]
Rhi: Has Blaire come back?
Kim: Yeah. Kinda pouty, but she’s there.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, are you excited for the vacation? It’s coming up soon!
Kim (as Blaire): Huh? What? What are we doing?
Josie (as Minx): The vacation, slash heist, slash mostly vacation, slash kind of heist.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. Yeah, yeah. That’s… mm hmm. Pumped.
Josie: Minx kind of sobers at that also, and:
Josie (as Minx): Is everything alright?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, everything’s fine. It’s just that, you know, I busted Tira out and I think her time spent in the jar kinda messed with her a little. She seemed to forget a little bit more than she usually does. I set her up with The Reconciled and told her to stay there, so… because I didn’t know where else to put her. But…
Josie (as Minx): Well, no, that was good. That was good.
Kim (as Blaire): I just, I mean, she was already kind of, you know, fragmented to begin with. And then I just… she got torn apart a little bit more and it was because of me.
Josie: Minx is gonna kneel and hug Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): I just—
Josie (as Minx): You don’t need to explain further. I understand. And I’m partially responsible as well. If we hadn’t… if I hadn’t treated this so off-handedly, if I had thought it through more, then we wouldn’t have taken that risk.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, no. It was my idea to drag Tira into this, and now she’s more lost than she even was before.
Minna (as Myra): I understand the guilt that you’re both feeling, and I feel it to some extent as well. If this is gonna keep working, then we’re going to have to let other people risk themselves. We have to make sure they understand the risks, and we have to make sure that, you know, they’re truly willing to risk things. But I don’t—
Josie (as Minx): There wasn’t supposed to be much risk at all this time. The only reason I suggested it was to help pay back a friend for the risks they took for us.
Minna (as Myra): So maybe we need to be savvier about assessing risks. If we’re thinking about spirits as, especially Reconciled spirits, as full spirits, I mean full people, wo run the same risks we do—
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): Which we are doing, I understand that. A haunting is going to be at risk for a Spirit Warden visit, and we’ll just have to remember that.
Josie (as Minx): They showed up so quickly.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know why I didn’t think this through. I’m so stupid.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, no. You’re remarkably intelligent and caring and aware. Just because we, as a group, failed once does not mean you are lesser in some way.
Kim (as Blaire): I just… I just hope that whatever damage I did to her tonight can be undone. You know?
Josie (as Minx): But I suppose only time will tell there, so…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna somewhat awkwardly turn around toward the luggage again.
Josie (as Minx): Fortunately, we are poised for a success that should keep people safe. And I will finally have a chance to wear this jacket.
Rhi: [laughs]

"Season 3, Episode 5: The White Wyrm Score Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome to Whitehollow. In this episode The magpies are taking the long-promised trip out of Duskwall to the city of Whitehollow. If you haven’t had a chance to listen to our worldbuilding bonus episode I highly recommend checking that out.
As always, please continue to support the show in whatever ways you can; reviews, Patreon support, pin purchases, tweets, fan art, we love it all.
In case you missed it, I was a guest player on the Roll Out Podcast where I got to play a one-shot of Turn. Turn is a really charming RPG about shapeshifters in small towns, and I had a great time playing with everyone. Links to both episodes are in the show notes.
Next, I’d like to tell you about this month’s Featured Charity… which is partly about a specific charity and partly about a specific issue in the US.
As some of you may know the Trump Administration recently implemented new rules for SNAP benefits. SNAP is a program that allows people with low incomes to get financial help with buying food. Food insecurity is a major issue throughout the nation and millions of people depend upon this support. These new rules would, in short, make it far more difficult for people to access the funds they need to feed themselves and their families. Money is always tight during the holidays and there are hundreds of charities asking for your support, but if you’re able locate a local food bank or other food access program to donate to.
If you’re in Chicago, my personal request is support for the Glenwood Sunday market. It’s a farmers market that I volunteer for, and one of our core missions is to provide a food access program. The neighborhood that I live in has a food insecurity rate of about 30%. The Glenwood Sunday Market works to support people facing food insecurity through our SNAP matching program. For the six months out of the year that the farmers market is open, anyone who shops at our market with SNAP funds gets a triple match of money. That means if someone charges $25 to their SNAP account we give them $75 to spend on food at the market. This year we gave away $26,000, a $6,000 increase over what we gave in 2018. We want to continue these programs in 2020, but the federal grants that provided a lot of our food access funding are in jeopardy, so any donations you can make would be greatly appreciated.
If you can’t donate, please visit 5calls.org and contact your representatives about this critical issue or see if you can find a food bank to volunteer with. Things are really hard right now all around the world. It’s important to do what we can, even in the smallest ways, to take care of each other.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:03:13]
Rhi: We open up on The Deathlands, the distant Void Sea, the rolling hills, the petrified forests, and cutting through this dark, abandoned terrain is a set of train tracks. Racing along the train tracks, we zoom in on a long train that is loaded with a mix of cargo and passenger cars. The engine has sort of a blue-green electroplasmic glow to it. It’s not smoke that billows out of the stack, it’s a sort of glowing steam that occasionally shoots off electroplasmic sparks.
The camera pans down the train, large cars loaded down with coal or other ores mined in Duskwall, manufactured goods, and along the tops of all the cars occasionally you see people in lightly armored jackets, long lightning hook poles strapped to their backs, and lines keeping them clipped to cables that run the length of each car, the Rail Jacks that protect the trains from spirits.
Minna: Oh, that’s metal as hell.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: The Rail Jacks are so fucking cool.
Minna: I didn’t realize that’s what the Rail Jacks were!
Rhi: And from the outside of the train we pan in through a window in one of the passenger cars to the small, private room where the Magpies are seated. And yeah, the three of you are in there with your luggage stowed in racks up by the ceiling. It’s a fairly long trip from Duskwall to Whitehollow, somewhere between 18 and 20 hours, so you’ll end up sleeping on this train. You did not have the money for a sleeper car to have proper beds. You’ll just kind of have to make do with the benches in here.
But yeah, what are the three of you doing as we zoom in on your compartment? And what does, I think particularly for Minx, what does the travel clothes look like?
Josie: Uh-huh!
Minna: Heehee.
Josie: Well, imagine a western movie and what you would imagine a southern belle on a train dressed in.
Kim: Ohhh~!
Rhi: [giggles] Oh goodness. Like full-on hoopskirt situation or a little more sedate than that?
Josie: Oh yeah, definitely down below it’s hoopskirts.
Rhi: Oh my God.
Kim: Josie, here’s the very important question though. Do you have a church fan?
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yes, obviously.
Kim: Yes!
Josie: And also a small bowler hat.
Kim: Yes. Oh, that’s so cute~
Josie: And she’s sitting there, legs crossed, sort of tilting her head back and forth happily, because this is a scenario that she’s been wanting. I think she’s reading a book which she specifically bought for the purpose of looking sophisticated on the train. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Oh God. Again, Minx’s commitment to the aesthetic is so strong and powerful and inspiring. It’s very good.
Josie: I am glad.
Rhi: All right. How are Myra… What’s Myra and Blaire up to?
Minna: Myra is probably also reading, but I think she’s as ready as she can be for the situation ahead so she’s reading for pleasure. I think she’s got some of the recently printed stuff from the underground historian people in Duskwall, because she’s a nerd.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Nice. And Blaire, what are you up to?
Kim: Blaire is hunched over on the little table in the train compartment between the two benches. She is drawing in her journal mostly for pleasure and less so for notes because there’s nothing to observe here. She is drawing what looks to be a very crude picture of Hex.
[awing]
Rhi: There’s not really- It’s very hard to see anything outside, because one, you’re going so fast, and two, it’s pitch black constantly. I think that the Rail Jacks can see where the train passes through the ruins of small towns. I think the train lines were built on the remains of old trading roads, so it kind of follows those paths that caravans used to take where there were little small trading outposts and things, but none of you in the train are really able to see them. At this point you’re probably only an hour outside of Duskwall, and as you’re all sitting there enjoying the novelty of this train ride there’s kind of a light rap at the door and then it slides open and a woman in the crisp, you know, we’re gonna say dark green conductor’s uniform pokes her head in.
Rhi (as Conductor): Excuse me, ladies. Can I get your tickets?
Josie (as Minx): Of course, dear.
Josie: Minx will produce hers.
Kim (as Blaire): Our what?
Rhi (as Conductor): Tickets.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh yeah!
Kim: And Blaire produces her tickets from a random page from bookmarked in her journal.
Minna: [smiling] I feel like Myra has a little folio with papers and notes and things, and that’s where the ticket is.
Rhi: Of course. Yeah. So, she’ll collect them and take them.
Rhi (as Conductor): Huh, Whitehollow? You three enlisting?
Minna (as Myra): It’s a little late for that, isn’t it?
Minna: [chuckles]
Kim (as Blaire): Enlisting what?
Rhi (as Conductor): Oh, in the military. It’s still a military outpost.
Kim (as Blaire): [cackles]
Rhi (as Conductor): I’ll take that as a no. But, well, I hope whatever you’re doing there you have a good time or a short trip if it’s not gonna be a good time.
Rhi: She salutes you with the tickets and then steps back into the hall and pulls the door shut.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, is Whitehollow a bad time?
Minna (as Myra): How much do you two know about Whitehollow?
Josie (as Minx): Not much. I know it is hot.
Rhi: And you two would both—Well, Blaire I think got to Duskwall right after the Unity War ended, so I think Tycheros is so far away from the rest of the Empire that you probably didn’t hear a lot of news about it, so Blaire would not know much about Whitehollow at all. Minx, you would know that Whitehollow is where people who got drafted went. You know that it was the main staging area for the military during the Unity War, so you probably knew some folks who got drafted, and a lot of people who probably dodged the draft and became criminals. [laughs] Like, yeah, I am now on the run because I got drafted and I don’t wanna.
Minna (as Myra): So Blaire, the history of this place is this is where everybody who left for the Unity War ended up. They all came here.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh.
Minna (as Myra): You got your Whitehollow letter, and you went to Whitehollow, and you were off to war from there and who knew if you’d come back the same person, or at all. But Whitehollow is more than just the place where the military came when the war happened. Before then it was a city of artisans. They do steel working, arms manufacturing, silver smithing, that’s what kind of stuck around after the war. Still have a strong military presence which, you know, our conductor alluded to. The military itself is mostly gone now except for the people who hung around and are just making themselves at home.
Kim (as Blaire): So, what does that mean for Bluecoat presence?
Minna: Do I know this? It’s not in my notes.
Rhi: Yeah, I don’t think you were able to get… It is a fair assumption to be like “they have a police force,” but I don’t think you’re gonna know the specifics of how that police force works.
Minna (as Myra): I mean, law and order probably still holds, but I don’t know what that looks like there.
Kim (as Blaire): Gross.
Josie (as Minx): [chuckles] Yes, well, fortunately I hear it at least used to be a rather pleasant place. I suppose we’ll see how the war changed it.
Minna (as Myra): So, hand of Kotar. I managed to track it to Whitehollow via a bulletin that made its way to Duskwall. The Delvers Guild in Whitehollow found an occult preserved hand from ancient times. They’ve already sold it off to Admiral Hubert Stroman. He’s one of the ruling council in the city right now. He’s pretty soon gonna hold an auction to sell off a bunch of artifacts; rare, historical, and probably occult. It’s phrased as “strange” but that’s my best guess. So, I think that we’re gonna have to look into this auction, because it’s quite possible the Hand will be there and he doesn’t know what he has, or if he does that’s gonna be even more of a problem.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, another one.
Kim (as Blaire): [giggly] This is so crazy. We’re gonna get the Hand!
Josie (as Minx): Well, we’re not gonna use the Hand, though.
Kim (as Blaire): [disappointed] Oh… But we gotta know how it works, especially since we have the Eye, too.
Josie (as Minx): Do we have to?! If we just keep it locked away in a box that’s sufficient, is it not?
Kim (as Blaire): [whining] Minx, no. Minx…
Josie (as Minx): Listen. I am fairly understanding of eyeball friend despite some prior experiences, but using multiple of these, that is the very definition of a bad idea.
Kim (as Blaire): Well that’s why we do it in a controlled setting, and first we test it in an isolated position so that way we can theorize about how it’ll interact with each other.
Josie (as Minx): So what you’re saying is you will be doing it far away from The Nest and thus my room?
Kim (as Blaire): I’ll be doing it far away from your room.
[giggling rises into laughter]
Josie (as Minx): I suppose these are questions for later.
Rhi: All right. I think we pull back from the train again and then fade in several hours later as the train pulls into the station at Whitehollow. This city is very different than Duskwall. Duskwall is very, very cramped and crowded, fairly tall buildings. Whitehollow is built along a river that has fractured out into a delta, so there’s a lot of little scattered islands amongst the rivers. It’s very spread out. It’s still surrounded by a lightning barrier, but while it occupies less geographic space than Duskwall it feels more open, and you can see out past where the river flows into the Void Sea there is what, at first glance, looks like just a mountain out in the sea, but it’s actually this massive, massive coral reef that juts up above the sea line. But yeah, the three of you have I think exited the train station with your luggage. How much luggage does Minx have?
Josie: Hmm… Putting an exact number is probably a bad idea, but more than three.
Rhi: More than three suitcases?
Josie: More than three trunks, yes.
Rhi: And then I think Blaire and Myra each have ‘a bag.’
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah. Myra has the equivalent of a duffle bag.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, and Blaire just has her backpack that she takes on Deathland trips.
Rhi: Blaire is the world’s most efficient packer. So yeah, the three of you have reached Whitehollow. It’s decidedly warmer; not like ‘hot’ hot, but it’s a lot warmer than Duskwall, very humid. Yeah. I think you have arrived a few hours before sunset, so you’ve got time to get settled into a hotel and then maybe check out the city, see what the night life is like. You find a hotel. Somebody give me the name of this hotel.
Kim: The Four Peasons.
Rhi: [flatly] No.
Kim & Josie: [laughs]
Minna: The Fairgate… I can’t do Arms again.
Rhi: No. The Fairgate Hotel.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: It’s a family name. they’ve owned this hotel for generations. You all expect to be staying in Whitehollow for a few days, and I think it’s gonna cost 1 coin basically for those few days that you’re there, but in terms of sleeping arrangements there is a bed and then a large couch that one of you can sleep on. It’s near the town square, so you all can see the clock tower that’s one of the tallest structures in the city. It’s this huge, big tower with this really intricately crafted clock on it, lots of silver filigree and just beautifully crafted. The one thing that mars this clock though, and I think from your rooms you have a pretty clear view of it looking out the window, the way that the hours work in the Empire, the first twelve hours of the day are numbered and the next twelve hours of the day are given names based on local custom, every city has a different set of names for those second twelve hours, but if you’re in the military you need a uniform set of names so everyone in the military uses the Imperial City ones.
So, this clock has the Whitehollow names artfully, in this very beautiful silver lettering on the clock, but then next to it in heavy iron that’s bolted on and it looks really ugly and out of place are the Imperial City names for the hours. I think that’s kind of the view that you have as you’re getting settled into your hotel room.
Josie (as Minx): At least it’s a mostly nice view. I imagine since I am the least petite of us I shall be taking the couch. Fortunately, I came prepared.
Josie: She’ll pop open a trunk with a bunch of her bedding from home in it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Oh my God.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Ah, there’s some poor porter who works at this hotel who had to haul all of Minx’s stuff up to the room.
Josie: Yes, it’s a shame, but what am I going to do, not come with my preferred bedding? Now that’s just ridiculous.
Kim: A girl has standards.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: Precisely!
Rhi: Oh man. So, you are in Whitehollow, you have your hotel room. I think that the auction is indeterminate number of days away that give you enough time to prepare, but you know, probably no more than three days, so one to three days until this auction, as with many things in Blades the exact amount of time will be determined by the narrative.
Kim: Schrödinger’s time.
Rhi: Yeah. So what do you all wanna do? We can start Gather Info, we can kind of just let you all explore the city some? Both at the same time? However you wanna approach it.
Josie: It will be good to both scout escape routes and go shopping.
Rhi: I will tell you that for Gather Information all of the rolls are gonna be at reduced effect because you are in a new place, you do not know people here, you’re away from your normal networks and contacts and everything, so it’s just gonna be harder to get information here.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Just because you’re in a completely different environment. But yeah, I don’t know if you all wanna go out together, if you’re all gonna scatter. I imagine that each of you has very different interests.
Josie (as Minx): I think we should stay together for the moment, enjoy things.
Minna (as Myra): That sounds like a good idea.
Josie (as Minx): Besides, we have time enough today to hit both the market and somewhere more related to our business.
Rhi: Do you wanna start at the marketplace? That’s also not a bad way to, you know, just sort of pick up general gossip and information.
Minna: It really isn’t.
Josie: Sure.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: All right. I think you get directions from the receptionist at the hotel. They tell you how you can get to the market which in Whitehollow is a floating market. There’s just barges and boats, and there is… I don’t think they’re called the Gondoliers here. What do we think the folks that take you around on boats would be called?
Kim: The Ferriers?
Rhi: Ooh! I like that. yeah. It feels very similar in terms of how they operate.
Kim: Yep.
Josie: Mm-hmm. I imagine that it’s actually slightly bigger boats, because water traffic is even more essential here, so rather than a carriage it’s kind of like a water bus.
Rhi: Yeah, and they probably have early – rather than it all being paddling with oars – if they have some kind of early electric, or in this case electroplasmic motors, and they’re super loud, like it’s almost impossible to have a conversation on these things because these motors are so loud.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re able to ride on one of these. Even though the motors are really loud it’s still kinda cool because you’re going way faster than you ever would go on a gondola. Yeah, I think there’s designated bus stops for lack of a better description at the market where you can get off, and a lot of the barges and boats and things are connected by walkways. Yeah. The market is just this big, sprawling thing. I think there’s a lot of, similar to the kind of lights that are up in Nightmarket during Doskvorn, those little fairy light type things, those are just all over the place. There’s some bigger colored lanterns and things as well. There’s people standing outside all of the shops hawking their wares, trying to get people to come in and spend their coin.
Josie: Minx is going right for the jewelry. [laughs]
Minna: Oh my goodness.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. I think that there is… It’s very large. I think it takes up a whole boat. Minx, you notice a couple things as you hurry aboard. One, this place is just filled with beautifully crafted, primarily jewelry.
Josie: [gasps]
Rhi: But there’s a lot of other very fine silver pieces here. And two, oh my God, there’s so much security. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] Oh dear.
Rhi: Like, there’s so much. It doesn’t seem to be like the local police force, this is private security. They’re all wearing silver lapel pins with that same symbol on them, and there’s in kind of the first room that you step into – which is like a large room with several glass display cases – there’s probably like ten guards and maybe three actual clerks to help people.
Josie: Uh-huh… Regardless of that fact, I don’t think Minx actually notices, because her eyes get all wide and is like…
Rhi: Oh. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): So much silver…
Rhi: Steven Universe star eyes.
Josie: Precisely. She’s gonna be on this boat for a while. Whatever Gather Infos happen Minx needs to go last, because she’s distracted.
Rhi: I do have a question for Minx. Did you tell Nyryx that you were leaving town for a bit?
Josie: Yeah, probably.
Rhi: Do you think you’re gonna bring her a present back?
Josie: Oh! Yes, yes, I should do that.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. So Minx is enraptured by these very—and they are beautifully, beautifully crafted pieces. Myra, what are you up to?
Minna: I think I’m mostly walking around and complimenting venders on their wares and asking them “oh, so what’s going on, I’m new,” and hear anything interesting that’s happening, maybe implying that I have a little money to splash around.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. Go ahead and give me some kind of roll for that and we’ll count this as a Gather Info.
Minna: Consort?
Rhi: Yeah, sounds like a Consort.
Minna: That’s a 6.
Rhi: Okay. You’re gonna get a standard amount of information. I think particularly if you start off in the same silver shop that Minx is in…
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: You start to get some information about this auction. Some people have invitations. If you did not get an invitation you can buy your way in, you can buy an invitation basically, if you pay enough money.
Minna: How much money are they thinking that is?
Rhi: Two coin per person, so not cheap, but the way that you’re talking and presenting yourself the people who are giving you this information assume you have that kind of money, of course. Blaire, what do you go poking around at?
Kim: Blaire is going to try and sniff out if there’s anything occult or weird in this marketplace, obviously.
Rhi: Yeah, I’m gonna just let you kind of have this. I think that if you ask around, because Myra did mention this Delvers Guild as the people who found the Hand, and they sold it, and it sounded a little bit like maybe they dealt with some occult stuff. I think that they actually do have basically an antiques shop?
Kim: Yeah!
Rhi: On one of the barges. Maybe not a full shop, but they have a tent?
Kim: Yeah!
Rhi: On a barge, where they will sell… the things that are more like oddities and trinkets that they have found. The really expensive stuff obviously they’re not gonna put out here, but just sort of weird little stuff that they’ve dug up or pulled up.
Kim: Yeah, no, she’s all there for it.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that you’ve been around enough, you know how to ask questions in the right way to get pointed to the sort of things you’re interested in. You find your way to the Delvers Guild little shop. I don’t know that you necessarily at this point know exactly what they do, you just know that they are called the Delvers Guild.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: I think that this tent is fairly large, has lots of shelves that I think are covered in a fine mesh netting to keep stuff from falling if the barge that it’s on shifts any.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: And to, you know, prevent shoplifting. There’s a couple people standing around that look like they work there. Josie, since you came up with the Delvers Guild, what do you think their insignia or uniform or something would be?
Josie: I imagine their general aesthetic is pretty dark and sleek, you know, like stuff that can go under diving suits and the like.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: As for their logo? I kind of imagine like a chalice but a stylized chalice, so it’s just like a V, and then depending on how detailed this particular insignia is it’s just a triangle of blue within.
Rhi: Ooh! Cool.
Josie: Or like waves, right?
Rhi: That’s cool.
Kim: That’s dope.
Rhi: So, I think that they are also wearing those that are wrought in silver and then the blue waves part is painted on the silver. I think there’s maybe one or two other customers in here poking around. There’s a middle-aged person in form-fitting dark clothes, dark skin, kind of short cropped very curly hair, who will give you a little bit of a bow when you come in.
Rhi (as Delver): Welcome, miss. We don’t see many Tycherosi around here. Can I help you?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! I’m just looking around. I only know you guys by reputation and kind of name. What is it that you guys do?
Rhi (as Delver): Ah, you just, uh, I assume you’re visiting from elsewhere.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Delver): Yes. Well, the Delvers Guild, we have been around for quite some time and we seek out things that are lost, mostly to the waters here in Whitehollow. The river that we are built across was not always like this. During the Cataclysm it fractured and split into this delta that we now live on, and you can see a great many of them here. We just collect oddities and trinkets and antiques and occasionally stranger artifacts will fall into our hands, but for those you have to sort of put in special requests.
Kim (as Blaire): [grinning] What do you mean by stranger?
Rhi: They kind of look you over and glance around a bit.
Rhi (as Delver): Objects of a spiritual bent, one might say.
Kim (as Blaire): Hmm?! Go on. … Sorry, no, I don’t mean to come across as weird, I’m just really into this stuff.
Rhi (as Delver): Certainly. You seem like a bit of an explorer yourself.
Rhi: I assume Blaire is still kind of kitted out.
Kim: Oh yeah. She’s way into this.
Rhi: They kinda size you up.
Rhi (as Delver): Well… follow me.
Rhi: Actually, you know what, before we do that give me a Gather Info roll to see what this person has available.
Kim: Ah. I would guess this… Is this a Consort?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Highest is a 5.
Rhi: Five, okay, so that’s gonna be limited info. I think they nod and kinda gesture for you to follow them up towards the front of the store where there’s sort of a large glass case that serves as also the counter, and in this case there are what you can recognize as stones carved with very simple runes, a number of spirit bane charms or demon bane charms, there’s a couple spirit masks.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: They’re an older style. They look like they might be a century or so old.
Kim: Ohh…
Rhi: Like, it’s cool, but it’s nothing really…
Kim: Earth-shattering?
Rhi: Yeah. There’s nothing here that is at the level of “you found one of the Relics of Kotar and didn’t know what you had and sold it.”
Kim: Damn it.
Rhi: Yeah. They’re cool little trinkets, but ultimately they are just trinkets.
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: So if you’d like, you know, a souvenir, you could get a cool little spirit mask.
Kim: Honestly, I would. I can keep that on my shelf. A century’s old spirit mask? Hell yeah.
Rhi: Yeah!
Kim: Oh wait. I don’t have money…
Rhi: Yeah, I don’t think Blaire has money. [chuckles]
Kim: Blaire has 0 coin.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: Oh my God, Blaire. Do you have anything in your stash?
Kim: No. I used it all for downtime actions. Oh wait! Wait! I have 1 coin. Phew.
Rhi: You have 1 coin?
Kim: Just one.
Rhi: Okay. You’re not gonna spend the whole 1 coin on this. You’ve got enough pocket change to buy one of these masks.
Kim: Yay. Fuck yeah.
Rhi: You’re probably gonna have to ask Minx and Myra to pay for your meals.
Kim (as Blaire): Hey, so like, I don’t have any money… like, I don’t have any money.
Josie (as Minx): That’s quite all right, dear. I came prepared.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. You’re able to get an old, not necessarily archaic, but you know, an old spirit mask. What do you think it looks like?
Kim: Blaire’s spirit mask she made herself so it’s very personalized. This one is less so personalized, it’s very generic, but it is no less lacking in craftsmanship at all. Whoever it was meant for or if it was meant for the general public it’s still very polished even though it is weathered. I’m imagining something closer to maybe what the mask in Dishonored looks like, so lots of gears and machinery but very functional.
Rhi: Okay, you’re able to get that. I don’t think it’s gonna function as a fine spirit mask.
Kim: No.
Rhi: I think it’s just a regular spirit mask.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: But it’s a cool thing that you’ve got.
Kim: Something she can keep on the shelf with tens of thousands of her other shit.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Blaire is a hoarder.
Rhi: Okay. The three of you reconvene, probably back at the silver smith’s, the Silver Spinners boat, because Minx has not left. [laughs] Then yeah, I think we see just a few scenes from how you all spend the rest of this evening. This is sort of your free evening before you gotta buckle down and get to work and start planning a crime.
Josie: I think we cut to dinner with the three of them around the table and Minx has scouted ahead and knows what she’s getting into. The other two probably haven’t. You know, these big plates of steaming seafood and crustaceans and stuff arrive which is probably not super common in Duskwall.
Rhi: There is a fair amount of seafood in Duskwall because it’s still a coastal city, but this is mostly freshwater stuff.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So there’s like, I think that the appetizer is just this huge thing of probably steamed crawdads. [laughs]
Josie: Minx has a fanciful lobster bib.
Rhi: [giggles]
Kim: Of course she does.
Rhi: Oh, that’s very good.
Josie: Yeah, I mean you don’t want to splatter. Come prepared.
Minna: I mean, at the nice dinner we’re definitely clinking glasses and there’s a white drink. [laughs]
Rhi: So you all learn at dinner that the local alcoholic beverage of choice is a cocktail called the White Wyrm. I think the server that talks to you says that, you know, every establishment that serves drinks in this city has their own twist on the basic recipe which is at its core goat’s milk and an alcohol that’s basically vodka, but everybody adds their own thing. And of course the server tells you that, you know, “ours is the best.” So yeah, you all enjoy the local cocktail. Blaire, what’s another thing that we see on this montage?
Kim: I imagine that while the other two are getting ready for bed Blaire is sprawled out over the comforters of the bed kind of doing that, when you’re lying stomach-down on a bed you do that kicking thing with your legs, while she’s just finishing making notes in her journal.
Josie: [laughs] Aww.
Rhi: Uh-huh. Very good.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Yeah~
Minna: Can I add a dumb, light detail while they’re getting ready?
Kim: Please.
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: Because I think they all drank a little bit more White Wyrm than they usually would if they were working.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: I think Myra’s just kind of like, semi-drunkenly, musing about the poets who live here and she’s read some of their work, and just so strange to be in this place that she never thought she would be in.
Rhi: Aww.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: So, the next day, I think you’re all sort of shifting your attention into preparing for this auction properly. You can all continue to do some info gathering, try to figure out how you’re gonna get in, what your options are, things like that.
Josie: Yeah. I think Minx is in favor of – at least for her – getting a cover identity, going in the quote unquote “legit” way, and trying to figure out what she can while there.
Minna: The thing is, how much money do we have and how much money are we willing to spend? Do we have to keep some money back for the auction?
Rhi: Yeah. To get into the auction, if all three of you wanted to get in legitimately, it would be a total of 6 coin.
Josie: [stammers] Okay.
Minna: Which is all of the money that we probably have, like pooled together.
Josie: Yeah…
Minna: So, I think somebody’s gonna have to go in un-legit-ly.
Rhi: At least one somebody.
Josie: Yeah. Would the two of you disguising yourselves as staff be a thing?
Minna: Oh, we haven’t done that in a while.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Because staff gets in free.
Rhi: That’s true.
Minna: Didn’t, last time we do that, we shot somebody? [laughs]
Josie: I mean, just don’t go in shady back rooms this time.
Minna: I love it. Let’s nobody get captured and put on an altar. [laughs]
Josie: [smiling nervously] Mm-hmm!
Rhi: Yeah. If you wanted to take that approach of trying to find out how the staffing is gonna work for this event you could do that.
Josie: Yeah. I think Minx wants to pay her way in legitimately just to minimize risk there.
Rhi: For that it’s not gonna take a Gather Info roll. You are just able to. If you ask around being like hey I wanna get in on this auction you’re very quickly directed to the estate of this admiral.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It is naturally on the coast overlooking the harbor. I think it’s up on a cliff. Or no, there wouldn’t really be cliffs, I said this was a pretty flat terrain. I think it’s up on a hill. It might not be a natural hill. [chuckling] It’s probably a manmade hill that this asshole made them build for his house. I think that there’s kind of a tent or some kind of temporary structure outside the fence where you can make your purchase. So yeah, you can very easily spend 2 coin and get a legit invitation.
Josie: Right. I kind of wanna do a setup action to make sure my cover identity is established ahead of time.
Rhi: Yeah, go ahead and roll something for how you’re gonna go about setting up that cover ID.
Josie: I want to establish a military persona.
Rhi: Ohh, okay.
Josie: Not one from here, someone who is possibly on a different front, but basically I wanna make it seem impressive, like the idea being people will question me less because it’s like…
Rhi: You’ve got some kind of rank. But you don’t wanna be so high up that any of the military people here feel like they should know you.
Josie: Right, which now occurs to me that I need to look up what military structure looks like. [laughs]
Minna: I think captain sounds dashing, but that’s just because I’m coming off persuasion rants.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: And I feel like captain is also high enough rank that you will garner respect but not so high ranked that a general would necessarily recognize you off the bat. And I mean, really, Minx is just so much about the aesthetic, I feel like she would think about being called captain and just be all about that.
Josie: Yes. I’m very much into it. I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay, so with a 5… maybe you’ll have improved effect when you’re talking to military personnel?
Josie: Yeah, let’s do that.
Rhi: Okay. So Minx has just bought an invitation and has established this cover identity as, you’ll have to come up with what your fake name is, but you are some kind of captain in the Imperial Military.
Josie: Captain Celia Abernathy.
Rhi: Ooh~!
Minna: Beautiful.
Kim: Hot!
Rhi: A powerful name.
[laughter]
Minna: We all immediately die.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a good name! Myra and/or Blaire, what are you two thinking in terms of how you’re gonna get in?
Minna: Do we wanna try the staff approach? Do we want to try the make friends approach? What do we wanna try and do here?
Kim: See, I would suggest the make friends approach, but Blaire is very hyper-focused when it comes to socializing so I don’t know if that would do well for the team as a whole.
Minna: That’s super fair. We have done the staff thing and I do not mind doing it again.
Rhi: Yeah, so Myra, do you wanna roll some kind of Gather Info check to see?
Minna: Ooh boy, what is that?
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, there’s a lot of ways you could go about acquiring uniforms, or get hired. [laughs]
Minna: I was gonna say, we could get hired legitimately.
Rhi: This is the sort of thing where they would be hiring on a lot of temp staff.
Minna: Yeah, exactly.
Rhi: So you could try and do that.
Minna: Yeah! Would that be Consort? Because that’s being honest, -ish.
Rhi: [quavers indecisively]
Minna: I have a fine cover identity.
Josie: I mean, what’s a job interview except lying very well anyway? [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah… I feel like Sway is probably more apt.
Minna: Oh, because it’s a job interview, you’re right.
Rhi: Yeah, and you are not being honest in the least about why you’re trying to get this job.
Minna: Are we still at reduced effect for this?
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Yeah, so I’m pulling one that is submitted from a Patreon backer. This is, again, KrysmPhoenix. The bargain is you’ll end up isolated from your crew.
Minna: I get hired for back of house stuff and Blaire gets hired for front of house.
Rhi: Yeah, and Blaire—Yeah. Blaire and Minx will be able to connect very easily but Myra is gonna be elsewhere.
Minna: I’ll do that. I’ll take it.
Rhi: Thank you, KrysmPhoenix.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay. This is limited. So I think… Huh.
Minna: The isolation is actually that Blaire gets hired for front of house but I don’t.
Rhi: You don’t get hired at all?
Minna: At all.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s kind of what I was thinking, is that there ends up only being one position.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So Blaire and Minx are able to get in legitimately. Blaire has a job, Minx has an invite, and Myra is gonna have to find another way in.
Minna: I’m able to sneak.
Rhi: Okay. You all have ways in.
Josie: I think as part of Minx’s disguise efforts, at one point in the hotel room she tells Myra to just—
Josie (as Minx): Hold still for a moment, dear.
Josie: –and she like studies Myra for a second, and then does her hair like hers. She’s trying to look more severe.
Minna: [gasps]
[giggling]
Rhi: Yeah, oh that’s very good.
Minna (as Myra): You could have asked, dear.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think I need a braid?
Rhi: Your hair is so short.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but you could probably French braid it.
Minna (as Myra): We could slick it.
Kim (as Blaire): No. Ew. Gross. Greasy.
Josie (as Minx): I would love to partake in those experiments, but I think that might be better for after the job.
Kim (as Blaire): Ugh. Yeah, okay. I just… Ugh. I don’t know. Usually uniform server types there’s a dress code or some bullshit.
Minna (as Myra): I think all you need is a comb.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah? What are those?
Josie (as Minx): Or perhaps a nice hair pin.
Kim (as Blaire): A what?
Rhi: [laughs] There’s a montage of Minx and Myra doing Blaire’s hair.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Never mind, this can’t wait.
Kim: Blaire doesn’t know what a hair brush is, you guys.
Josie: Oh no!
Rhi: Does she just run her fingers through her hair every day?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: I could see Minx doing a pair of short French braids on the back of the head.
Minna: Aw, yeah.
Rhi: It’d be pulled back pretty tight, but yeah, it’d be cute. Okay, you’re all doing a light load out, so the engagement roll. I think I’m gonna stick with this being just a 1d roll, because I think you’re… I would take away a die for you being in a completely different city, but I think the fact that you are in a place where you are not recognized as wanted criminals is actually gonna help you out, so it breaks even there and it’s just gonna be one die. Well hot damn, that is a 6.
Josie: Nice!
Rhi: Yeah.
## Score [0:44:56]
Rhi: So, we start the night of this auction, this big, elaborate estate is all lit up. There is a line of people winding up towards the front doors to where invitations are being collected, and I think we first see Minx as she’s handing over her invitation. Go ahead and describe what Minx’s disguise looks like.
Josie: Well, as we just established, she’s looking a lot more severe than usual. She’s trying to strike a balance between reasonably Spartan but also fanciful enough for her.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: So her hair is pulled back pretty tight. Her dress is a black with gold trim military coat with black boots, and it’s fairly sleek and doesn’t have that much ornamentation but it does go past the waist so it can flow dramatically as she walks.
Rhi: Got a little bit of a flair to it?
Josie: Yeah, and it matches her cane which she clicks along in front of her. I think as part of her makeup she has put a scar across one eye…
Rhi: Nice.
Josie: …in just the right position as to be sexy. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, of course.
Minna: Does it cut her eyebrow in half?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Very good. The person at the door collecting the invitation is like:
Rhi (as Ticket Taker): Ah, Captain Abernathy. Welcome. Very glad to have you here.
Rhi: And you’re ushered inside.
Josie: She’ll just kind of nod sternly in response.
Rhi: So you head into the foyer of this estate, and you know, you’ve been in your fair share of grand estates at this point. Usually you’re breaking in. You’re always, if you’re not breaking in you have lied to get in there. This is top five one of the nicest places you’ve been in.
Josie: Does it rank higher or lower than The Centuralia Club?
Rhi: It’s up there, like, you’re having a hard time gauging which was a fancier environment.
Josie: Top five places too rich for you, number three will shock you.
Rhi: [laughs] It’s a big two-story foyer with huge windows that look out over the sea. The walls have a fair amount of paintings on them that are mostly either portraits of military generals and admirals or they are paintings of sea battles or ships. All of them have these really ornate silver frames, and for the most part it looks like the foyer is huge and it seems people are mostly kind of mingling and socializing out here while the auction itself is gonna be taking place in the ballroom, and nobody’s really been allowed in there yet.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Most people are just sort of standing around and chatting. There are servants milling around with trays of drinks. I think as, Minx, you’re kind of surveying this scene there’s a very familiar voice that offers you some kind of drink.
Josie (as Minx): Yes dear, thank you.
Josie: And then she’ll kind of wink at Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re welcome.
Kim: Wink.
Rhi: So, the two of you are in. Nobody really suspects you at the moment. Myra, how are you sneaking into this place? Or, more accurately since you’re starting in a controlled position, how did you sneak in?
Minna: [smiling] So, Blaire would have gotten a uniform. I saw the uniform she was dressed up in, acquired something similar, and just kinda walked in like I knew what I was doing.
Rhi: Blended in, like you walked in with a big group of people and just slipped away as names were being checked in?
Minna: But the entrance that was open was like back of house. It was like the kitchen entrance. She went to the kitchen entrance where everyone was gathered for a smoke break or whatever and she went back in with them.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. So, you’ve made it in. What you’re wearing was enough to get you through the door, I think, but you’re not gonna pass as a servant on close inspection.
Minna: Yeah, now I’m skulking.
Rhi: Yeah. Where precisely are you skulking?
Minna: I think I’m trying to find my way to where the auction stuff is happening, like where they’re keeping all the lots and things.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, in that case, give me some kind of roll as you are trying to make your way in that direction.
Minna: I think this is probably a Prowl, honestly.
Rhi: Probably, yeah.
Minna: Five.
Rhi: I think that you’re making your way down a back hallway towards where the ballroom is and you see somebody leave a room with a ledger tucked under their arm, and before that door closes you slip inside, and there’s crates and boxes and things piled up really high in here so you’re not immediately visible to the other people in this room, but there are other people in this room. You are now in a risky position.
Minna: Yeah. Okay.
Rhi: Let’s jump back up to the party. Minx and Blaire, what are you two up to?
Josie: Minx is trying to mingle, at least at first starting amongst people of her military—her supposed military rank, or sort of equivalent.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Okay, so there’s like, looking at a map of Skovlan, there’s three cities on here, and way up near the top there’s one called Blackvale, and I think what she wants to work to establish is like she’s kind of mysterious because the Siege of Blackvale or whatever was kind of far-flung and not a lot of details were known about it.
Rhi: Mm, yeah.
Josie: And then whatever it was trying to accomplish didn’t come to pass because the war ended.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Honestly, she’s trying to get people to come to her a little bit rather than seek people out.
Rhi: Okay. Are you trying—So you’re just kind of trying to draw social agro? Are you trying to get any information out of people or are you just sort of trying to pull attention?
Josie: I do want to try and get things out of people. I want to be like, oh, this is someone that an interesting conversation can be had with, and you know, maybe some weirder topics will come up in that conversation.
Rhi: Yeah, and it makes sense. You’re all here for this auction where everyone is like wink-wink, nudge-nudge, we’re all here to buy the weird occult shit.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. Go ahead and give me some kind of roll. For you, it’s still gonna be controlled.
Josie: [astonished] Wow… 2, 3, 3, 3.
Rhi: Oh my goodness. Wow, okay, so a 3.
Josie: Four dice. Phew, okay.
Rhi: I think what it is, you talk up, you’re like “oh yeah, the Siege of Blackvale,” and someone else is like “oh yeah, I was there too,” and it’s just like… shit. [laughs]
Josie: Ah. [laughs] Yeah, okay, so I had to bail out on that angle a little bit.
Rhi: Yeah, so you’re gonna withdraw that attempt?
Josie: Yeah, I think I need to pull back and rethink.
Rhi: I think you very quickly excuse yourself from that conversation and move away. While you’re regrouping, let’s see what Blaire is up to.
Kim: While Blaire is out and about, working at the party, posing as a server and giving everybody drinks, she’s getting a good sense of the perimeter, taking a look at potential exits should things go, you know, absolutely pear-shaped.
Rhi: Yeah! Go ahead and make a roll for that.
Kim: Ah-ha, that’s a 4 and a 1.
Rhi: Okay, so a 4. Again, this is you hesitate or you can do it with a minor complication.
Kim: I hesitate.
Rhi: I think what it is, every time you start trying to scope things out you get interrupted by somebody who wants a drink or is giving you their empty glass or has a special request from the kitchen, they want this particular thing from the kitchen, people just keep interrupting you, because you’re working a food service job right now and it sucks. [laughs]
Kim: It sucks real bad.
Rhi: Yeah. So you’re not able to quite figure out where good escape routes would be at this point, you’re just kind of staying afloat in your server position.
Kim: [disappointed] Yeah.
Rhi: I don’t know if you wanna reconnect with Minx since both of you have kind of had some difficulties.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m getting no luck, Minx. What about you?
Josie (as Minx): Hmm. Well, my approach didn’t seem the best either.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. No shit. People keep wanting stuff from me.
Josie (as Minx): I think it’s gonna be very contingent on the auction itself, this.
Kim (as Blaire): [sighs] Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Now my plan is to just wait until the auction, and then when it comes up try and cause some sort of war for the item. That can give us a cover.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Well, keep your eyes open. I gotta work on this cocktail for some rich asshole…
Rhi: [giggles]
Josie (as Minx): My sympathies.
[laughter]
Rhi: So, let’s cut back to Myra. I think that you had entered this room and you heard voices towards the back of the room and just instinctively ducked down to hide. What are you doing now?
Minna: Okay. I think what I’m looking for actually is some kind of indication of where the Hand would be.
Rhi: Okay. It’s gonna be risky, reduced effect, because due to the other people in the room you’re limited in how much of the room you can access.
Minna: Yeah, for sure. Five.
Rhi: You do it, but there’s a consequence. You are able to find, you’re sort of digging around, you’re able to find a book, a ledger, that has a list of all the lots that are up for auction. You’re kinda in a corner and you’re flipping through it, running your finger down the list, and there’s nothing in this ledger that seems to match the description of the Hand. I think you go through it once and you’re like okay, let me look again, and you start again from the beginning.
Minna: Maybe he isn’t selling it today.
Rhi: There’s a voice from behind you that says:
Rhi (as Voice): Hey! Who are you?
Rhi: And you are going to be in a desperate position, because you have been caught.
Minna: Ooh, no~!
Josie: Ohh…
Minna: Oh no, what do I do?
Rhi: You have been found. So yeah, what do you do?
Minna: Oh God. What do I do? Oh no.
Rhi: I mean, if you turn around you see a man in the actual servants’ uniform standing there eyeing you very suspiciously, and his friend is—or the, not friend, but his coworker, other servant, is standing a few feet back also looking at you.
Minna: Hmm, so this isn’t a good opportunity for [giggles] basically chloroform, because there’s two of them.
Rhi: Nope, because you have two witnesses. Yeah, there’s two people here.
Minna: And one of them is further away.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Minna: Can–? Okay, okay-okay-okay.
Minna (as Myra): I’m so sorry, I’m just, I’m looking, a little bit lost and I really didn’t want to tell the person in charge that I’m lost. I just figured I’d find out where to go and then I wouldn’t have to bother anybody.
Rhi: Uh…
Josie: That’s pretty real. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Make a roll. It’s desperate.
Minna: I’m definitely gonna push myself here, though. Hey! I critted!
Rhi: Holy shit!
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: Okay, you do it with increased effect.
Minna: That was a 5 and two 6s.
Rhi: Nice! Yeah, so I think the both of them, like, you just pull off socially awkward, bumbling guest so well that both of them are just like:
Rhi (as Servant): [sighs] Okay. Look. You’re very lost. You’re… Here, come on.
Rhi: And the first servant who had addressed you gently takes you by the shoulder and steers you back out of the room.
Rhi (as Servant): Okay, where are you trying to get to?
Minna (as Myra): I was trying to find a bathroom.
Rhi (as Servant): Ugh, okay, all right…
Rhi: And he will walk you down the hall to where the bathrooms are.
Rhi (as Servant): Here you go. You can’t go back into that room. That’s where all of the lots are being kept. We’re not supposed to let other people in there. I thought that door was locked. I’m gonna double-check that, but—
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I don’t know how I got—I just, yeah, once I was in there I kinda knew I wasn’t supposed to be in there, and that was… yeah. Sorry about that.
Rhi (as Servant): Oh, you know, it’s all right. These admirals are far better at sea battles than floor plans if you ask me.
Minna (as Myra): Well, it’s lucky he’s got someone as good as you to back him up.
Rhi (as Servant): Ah, well thank you, miss. But anyway, enjoy the rest of the party, and best of luck at the auction.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you. Have a nice night.
Rhi: [laughing] He will head off having safely escorted you to the bathrooms, not suspicious at all of the woman who was randomly pouring over the ledger.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Skyrim guard. “It must have just been my eyes.”
Rhi: [laughs] yeah! Pretty much. Oh God, yeah. You’ve made it out of there. I think you do go into the bathroom and wait there for a few minutes to make it seem like—
Minna: Yeah. I definitely take a few minutes to just cool off and breathe. I can’t believe that worked.
Rhi: I think as you’re coming out you hear people announcing that the auction is about to begin and there’s that kind of murmur of a crowd that is moving from one place to another as everyone files into the ballroom. So yeah, I think Minx and Blaire are both able to get into the ballroom no problem. Minx, where do you position yourself?
Josie: Well, is the guy who supposedly has the Hand here?
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, he is there in his uniform. I think he’s got white hair that’s starting to thin—
Kim: Fuck.
Rhi: –and a big handlebar mustache.
Kim: No~
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh my God, Kim. Are you fucking kidding me?!
Josie: Really? Really?!
Rhi: He looks like the god damn KFC colonel, Kimberly!
Minna: Right?!
Josie: Yeah! [laughs]
Minna: I was gonna say, this is Colonel Mustard. Different colonel, but still.
Rhi: Yeah! [laughs] I love you, Kim.
Kim: Stop kink shaming me.
Rhi: [cackles]
Josie: Oh my God!
Rhi: I’m leaving that in.
Kim: Nooo!
Minna: [laughs and squeals] That’s the stinger! That’s the stinger!
Rhi: That’s staying in the episode.
Kim: [feigned shouting] Nooo!
Rhi: Anyway. He sort of steps onto the platform that’s been set up and gives a speech about, you know, how glad he is that you all could be here, hopes that you all have enjoyed the party, says that the items here are things that have been acquired over many years of collecting, and he goes into some stories about how he acquired some of these and like… a number of these objects are things that he straight up looted from Skovlan.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Fucking gross.
Rhi: Yeah. These are like Skovlan historical artifacts that just got looted during the war.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: Yeah, it sucks. [laughs] And then there’s also some things that are historical relics from Whitehollow that, you know, he says that he has purchased or things like that, so he’s just auctioning off a bunch of other people’s history so that he can profit.
Kim: Gross!
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: As he’s giving this whole speech Blaire is against one of the walls, Minx is sitting in the crowd. Myra, where are you?
Minna: I feel like she’s kind of at the entrance, like hovering and watching, like not really being involved.
Rhi: Okay. Then he finishes his speech and says that he hopes everyone has come prepared to spend a lot to take home these artifacts and relics and things, and then he gets out of the way so that the auctioneer can start doing her work.
Josie: I want to keep an eye on him all night. I want to see his reactions to the various items that come up. If he leaves I want to follow.
Rhi: Okay. So, the auction starts and there’s a number of things that have been, like, you know, there’s… I’ll kick this out to the three of you. what are some of the things you think that come up for auction that are from Skovlan, from Whitehollow, there are some just weird occult things that he’s got.
Josie: Yeah, in that case I’m thinking old weapons or relics with like, you know, Celtic knots on them and stuff.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Like weird, old, ornate things.
Rhi: Okay. I think that there is a ceremonial sword that used to belong to a member of the Skovlan royal family.
Minna: Ohh. [groans]
Rhi: Yeah, that is up for auction. Minna, what did you have?
Minna: Yeah, my thought was like – and I don’t know if this is a reference to the entirely wrong geography – but I’m picturing just some kind of jewelry that was buried with a king, a nobleman, somebody.
Rhi: Yeah, I can totally see, particularly I think if you get far enough north in Skovlan and—
Minna: Like from a burial mound.
Rhi: Yeah! Or like far enough north you’re looking at people getting buried in permafrost.
Minna: Oh my God.
Rhi: Which I feel like maybe that’s an alternate way of trapping a spirit.
Josie: Hmm.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: Like you bury it deep enough in frozen ground and the spirit can’t escape.
Minna: And I like the idea that there’s some kind of representation higher up that then gets dressed in all of their worldly goods.
Rhi: Yeah! So they dug up the, there’s like a sarcophagus that has their things and then deeper below that is the body.
Minna: And if somehow they manage, if somehow their spirit manages to escape, they’re hoping they’ll be attracted to the things that they liked that they had in life and they’ll stay there instead of leaving.
Rhi: [gasps] yeah! Oh, that’s really cool! That’s very cool.
Josie: Ooh, appeasement.
Rhi: Okay, so it’s some kind of… Maybe it’s a chest plate from a piece of armor going back centuries old.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: But I think that there’s an implication in the description that the spirit of this ancient warrior may yet reside in this piece of armor. Kim, what have you got?
Kim: Would this guy have any interest in pillaging anything from the middle class? Any kind of artifact from a laymen.
Rhi: Potentially, if it’s something that seemed valuable.
Kim: Probably a centuries old family heirloom.
Rhi: Yeah, somebody’s heirloom.
Kim: Yep. No idea what family it’s from, but it was old, it was ornate, he wanted it, he took it.
Rhi: Yeah. Do you think it’s Skovlan or Whitehollow?
Kim: You know, I think it’s Whitehollow.
Rhi: What do you think it is, the heirloom?
Kim: Something that… It’s probably some kind of metal slab that has family sigils across generations carved into it.
Minna: Oh, yes~
Rhi: What if it’s like a serving platter or ornate plate or something that they’ve just etched into, like the family history is basically engraved around the edge of this thing.
Kim: Exactly, yeah, and there’s at least five generations worth of symbolism there.
Rhi: Yeah. I think Blaire, when that comes up, you notice one of the other servants, like, her jaw gets real tight and her hands get balled into real tight fists.
Minna: [sobs]
Kim: Yeah…
Josie: Aw.
Rhi: But she doesn’t do anything about it, she just watches. Are any of you gonna do anything during the auction or are you just waiting for the Hand to come up?
Josie: I’m waiting for the Hand to come up.
Kim: Waiting for the Hand.
Rhi: Yeah, so the auction goes, and goes, and they get down to it’s announced that this is the last item, and there hasn’t been a Hand. There’s been nothing that sounds even remotely like it could be the Hand of Kotar.
Josie: Hmm. What’s the last item?
Rhi: The last item is also from Whitehollow. I think it’s a piece of coral that’s been taken from the White Wyrm, or that’s been dipped in—what’s the word, gilded. It’s been gilded in silver.
Josie: Ooh.
Rhi: I think it was that fan coral so it’s very, very delicate. It’s a really cool looking thing, but also like… you broke this off from this thing where maybe coral doesn’t grow anymore because it’s above sea.
Kim: Oh yeah, no, if it’s out of the water it’s definitely dead.
Rhi: Yeah. That’s the last item that’s up for auction is this very cool looking, silver gilded piece of coral. There has not been anything that seems even remotely like it could be the Hand of Kotar in this auction.
Minna: He’s not selling it, or if he is, not publically.
Josie: Minx is going to stand up and leave the ballroom, just like, excuse herself, not like storm out.
Rhi: Yeah. I will say, with you keeping an eye on the admiral, he basically just stood at the back of the room with some of his buddies and was drinking the whole time, just seemed to be having a jolly time ,having a blast, not really paying much attention to the auction.
Josie: Minx is gonna go find Blaire and tell her:
Josie (as Minx): Go find Myra?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): And then meet in back, here.
Josie: And she’ll signal to kind of like the back of the stage.
Rhi: Blaire, I think the nice thing about being a servant is people don’t pay much attention to you, so I think you are very easily able to locate Myra. Go ahead?
Minna: Can I—I think Myra’s actually trying to chat with people in the auction room, like she’s kind of edged in there.
Rhi: Okay. Do you wanna roll? Are you trying to get some information?
Minna: Yes. It’s probably gonna be a Consort. I think what she’s gonna ask is:
Minna (as Myra): So have you heard much about the admiral’s private collection?
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, go ahead and make a roll.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: I’m trying to think of a good complication here.
Kim: My idea is that whoever it is that hears Myra and answers her is far too engaging and not as accurate as what Myra was hoping to be.
Minna: yes.
Rhi: I like that, yeah. I think that’s more reduced effect. The information that you get is unreliable.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: You’ve got somebody who, I think this is somebody who’s former military who… their plan for social climbing is pretending like they are closer to the admiral than they actually are and you’ve made the mistake of being like “so what do you know about the admiral?”
Minna: Well I specifically ask about the admiral’s private collection.
Rhi: Yeah. “Let me tell you about the time when Hubert – he lets me call him Hubert – gave me a tour of the private collection that he has!”
Minna: So he could just be riffing off me and there might not actually be a private collection.
Rhi: He could be, yeah. He gives you a bunch of information, but some of that information is just, a fair amount of that information is just lies, but Myra can’t tell what’s what because you just don’t know the situation well enough to be able to tell. And then Blaire comes over and collects you.
Kim (as Blaire): [sweetly] Miss, your drink.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you!
Rhi: [chuckles]
Minna (as Myra): Could you show me…
Minna: And then she whispers in her ear and it’s really just like, watermelon-watermelon, whatever.
Rhi: The three of you reconvene somewhere removed from the auction which I think is kind of wrapping up. The party is gonna sort of continue a bit after the auction.
Josie: I kind of want to convene where Admiral Stroman will likely go to when he’s leaving the room.
Rhi: Okay. There’s gonna need to be a roll or a flashback or something for you to figure out where he’s gonna be.
Josie: I don’t even know what that would be…
Kim: What’s the stress to do a flashback?
Rhi: It depends on how complicated the flashback is. It can be 0 to 2.
Kim: Okay, because I have the stress to spare. I would not be above doing some homework on this guy to get an idea of what his after-party scene kind of is and how loose or not loose he gets so we can get an idea of what his whereabouts are somewhat like during social settings such as these.
Rhi: Yeah. You could have chatted with some of the servants during training.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: I’m gonna say that’s a 1 stress flashback. Blaire has been able to figure out what his usual late party routine is. I think what it is, retires to a smaller room, not alone, there’s a small group of people with him to just kind of unwind as the party is winding down, socialize with a small group of friends, because I think he spent most of the party sort of politicking.
Josie: Yeah. I mean, if he’s not alone then I don’t really know what to do with this plan. I’m gonna be honest, I have no idea how to proceed from here. [laughs]
Rhi: There are still ways you could probably get him out of the room and get him alone. You do have somebody who looks like a servant with you who could possibly lure him out.
Minna: I like the idea of hey, we need you to come talk to X, he is having a fight with X other person.
Rhi: Yeah, General So-and-so needs to talk to you or whatever.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Where are Minx and Myra setting—What’s the location where you’re trying to get him to come to?
Josie: I’m thinking it’s… Are there any side rooms downstairs?
Minna: I think the second floor there’s gotta be a study or a drawing room or something that we can corner him in.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, you know what, the study works, because that’s where someone would go to try and find him, right?
Rhi: Yeah. I think there’s a, you know, he and his friends are in… I don’t know, like—
Josie: A drinking room. A parlor.
Rhi: Yeah, a drawing room… Yeah, something like that. The billiards room.
Minna: [simultaneously] They’re in the billiards room.
Rhi: There we go. [laughs]
Kim: Gross.
Minna: [laughing] We had the same thought at the same moment!
Rhi: I’m literally sitting here thinking about the map on the Clue board. What are my options? Conservatory? No. I think, Minx and Myra, maybe if you wanna do a group action of some kind to sneak up into this study…?
Minna: Group Prowl?
Josie: Yeah, might as well.
Rhi: I think it’s gonna be risky. Or, well, let me think. I actually think it’s gonna be controlled because Minx, with your appearance you look like you belong.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: And people aren’t gonna question if you’re with someone in military uniform, Myra’s gonna get a little bit of a pass, so I’ll put this in controlled position.
Josie: And I will lead this because I’m very good on stress.
Minna: Sure.
Josie: I got a 4.
Minna: I got a 1.
Rhi: Yeah, 1 point of stress, and I think you’re gonna do it with a minor consequence. I think what happens is you’re making your way to the study and a servant is coming down the hall and sees you, and I think sees you going into the study, like you’re half way through the door. It’s the same servant that ran into Myra, it’s the most gullible fool, and he’s just like:
Rhi (as Servant): Oh! Are you meeting with the admiral?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, as a matter of fact. He’s already been sent for.
Rhi (as Servant): Ah, okay. I will, uh, I’ll run downstairs and fetch a bottle of the scotch for you. I’m sure he’ll want that.
Rhi: I’m gonna start a clock. There’s going to be an intruder coming back in relatively short order.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Now, the intruder is an unarmed servant, but it’s a complication. You don’t need somebody else walking in while you’re threatening this guy.
Minna: Nuh-uh.
Rhi: So, that clock is gonna be Servant Returns, 1 out of 4. Yeah, the two of you get into the study. Where are you posting up?
Josie: I think Minx is gonna post up right across from the door.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Are you gonna sit at his desk?
Josie: Oh right, this is his study.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s a study.
Josie: Oh… Um.
Rhi: Do you wanna go for that power move?
Josie: Yeah, power move, doing it.
Rhi: Okay. Oh God! You should do the thing where you’ve got the chair, like the back of the chair towards the door and then you can spin around.
Josie: Yes! Yes! Minx is absolutely going to do that.
Rhi: [laughs] What is Myra doing that’s more subtle?
Minna: Leaning with her arms crossed behind where the door would open so that when he comes in she can just, like, flat her arm flat out to the side, close the door behind him.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yes! Okay, so you both have basically positioned yourself to be as extra as possible.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Minna: Of course.
Rhi: And I love it.
Josie: And Minx has a pistol in her lap, so you can’t really see it over the desk, but to a trained person like him he’ll probably know it’s there.
Rhi: Yeah, you got it. Okay, so the two of you are all set up, and we will cut over to Blaire as she’s knocking on the door. Well, I think it’s that knock-knock, open the door to the billiards room.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Unlike actual gatherings of people to smoke cigars in Victorian era this is a mix of genders, all sorts of folks are represented here. There’s a visible haze in the air and not all of it is from cigars. Some people are hitting some harder stuff. But yeah, people are drinking and talking and smoking. A couple people are playing billiards. A few of them just sort of glance up when you slip into the room, but you know, a servant is to be expected. You’re not, nobody is immediately suspicious of you.
Kim (as Blaire): Excuse me, Admiral Stroman.
Rhi: I think he’s in mid-conversation with some of his friends and sort of looks up and glares.
Rhi (as Stroman): [flatly] What?
Kim (as Blaire): General Halifax was just outside. He has some business with you he’d like to attend to. In your study, sir.
Rhi (as Stroman): Ah. [grunts] Fine, God, what a prick.
Rhi: He takes another drink.
Rhi (as Stroman): I’ll be back.
Rhi: And a couple of the other people around him are like yeah, yeah, and grumbling about this Halifax person as well. So yeah, he will stride out of the room. As soon as he’s out of the room you may as well not exist, Blaire, he’s not paying you any attention. He will stride into the study and throw the door open.
Rhi (as Stroman): All right, Halifax, what is this about–?
Rhi: Realizes there’s nobody else here as far as he can tell.
Minna: Myra shuts the door. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. I think Blaire is able to slip in just before the door shuts.
Kim: Oh yes. Oh yes.
Rhi: Yeah. So, door slams.
Josie: Minx slowly swivels the chair around with the most condescending look on her face.
Kim: Team Rocket style.
Josie: Yes, precisely.
Josie (as Minx): Admiral Stroman, I respect your time, I’ll skip right to the point. Where is the Hand?
Rhi: He is standing there with his hand on his pistol as soon as he sees what’s going on. Give me a roll. This is somebody who is more experienced than you as an individual, but you do have him outnumbered, so I’m gonna say it’s risky.
Kim: Would you like an assist, Josie?
Josie: Yes please. Yeah, and I’m gonna go for Sway on this one.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Can I push myself also?
Rhi: Uh-huh. You just wanna max this out?
Josie: Yeah! Yeah, 6d6, doing it… Whoa! I still got a 5, but there are four 1s in there. I want the listeners to know that.
Rhi: Blaire—Tell me how Blaire assists here. What does that look like?
Kim: I’m imagining that on the inside of the door to the study there is that lock-unlock switch on the doorknob, and as Blaire closes the door behind the admiral she very audibly clicks it to a locked position.
Minna: [quietly] Yes!
Rhi: Okay, yeah. So Myra had pushed it shut, and then Blaire just ‘click.’ He can tell that Minx has got, Minx is armed, he can tell that.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, my initial thought was that he’s gonna aim his gun at either Blaire or Myra, but I think he can tell that that’s not the smart play here, so I think I’m gonna go with reduced effect. He’s not gonna give you all the information you want right now. He just sort of glances between the three of you.
Rhi (as Stroman): The Hand? That’s what you’re after?
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi (as Stroman): Well, I’m afraid that you are too late. It has already been sold to another buyer.
Josie (as Minx): We can pay better.
Rhi (as Stroman): [laughs] I sincerely doubt that.
Minna (as Myra): Is your life worth more than whatever they paid you?
Rhi: Make a roll.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: [giggles] I think that’s a Command, unfortunately. Well, Command isn’t bad. I am gonna push myself.
Rhi: Yeah, okay.
Josie: Can I assist you?
Minna: Sure. Because you have—You raise your gun!
Josie: Oh yeah.
Minna: That’s a 6!
Rhi: Okay. I think he, again, kind of surveys the situation, has a gun pointed at him, he has not yet drawn his weapon, he just has his hand on the grip of the pistol. Does the math, and is just like:
Rhi (as Stroman): I very sincerely doubt that any of you have more money than a member of Duskwall’s ruling council. The Penderyns have very deep pockets.
Minna (as Myra): Ah, but we have your life in our hands.
Josie: Hold on. Which is Lady Penderyn again?
Rhi: Lady Penderyn, her husband is on the ruling council of Duskwall. She is a member of the Circle of Flame and apparently paid a ton of money to get her hands on it. So yeah, I think when Myra sais “so we have your life in our hands,” was that your line?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi (as Stroman): You could shoot me if you wanted, but it would not get you the Hand. That’s on its way back to Duskwall. And if you kill me there will be a manhunt across the Empire for the likes of you.
Josie (as Minx): When does the Hand leave, and by what means?
Rhi (as Stroman): [sighs] The early train, tomorrow morning.
Josie (as Minx): I see. Well, thank you for your time, admiral.
Josie: I think I wanna close this out by trance powdering him in the face.
Rhi: [laughs] Or, would Myra just chloroform him since she’s right there?
Josie: Oh yeah, do that.
Minna: Sure.
Rhi: Because I’m imagining there’s a fair amount of distance between Minx and this guy if she’s at the chair and he’s right by the door. I’ll give you that for free. I think that he’s so distracted by this conversation that Myra’s just, “thank you for your time,” (whoosh impact noise).
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: I’m so sad that we have to do a heist in the morning, because if we did not I would be leaving a Magpies pin on that desk, but we can’t because we’d be warning them that we’re after them.
Josie: Mm-hmm, but on the plus side we just get to walk out of here.
Minna: Oh yeah, for sure.
Kim: Which is so rare.
Josie: With no real consequence.
Kim: We never get to do that.
Rhi: Yeah. I think as you’re leaving you walk past that servant who has the bottle of scotch.
Rhi (as Servant): Oh! Oh no. Is your meeting already over?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, and I believe the admiral has already had too much to drink tonight. Sorry to waste your time.
Rhi (as Servant): Oh, that’s all right. Have a good night.
Rhi: And heads off. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And yeah, the three of you just leave and walk back to your hotel?
Josie: Yep.
## Downtime [1:22:56]
Rhi: So, for downtime, it’s gonna be very limited here. There’s not gonna be any payoff in terms of rep or coin, because y’all didn’t take anything, again. You’re not really gonna take any heat because this is in a different, like, you’re leaving town in the morning, it doesn’t really matter too much.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: And as far as downtime activities, you each get one. Your options are [laughs] acquire an asset or you can indulge your vice. No matter how you go about indulging your vice you’re gonna roll 2d6 and take the lower result, because basically you are not able to get access to your normal vice purveyors, you just kinda have to take what you can get, so it’s not as effective.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, let’s start with Myra.
Minna: I am indulging my vice. I’ve already rolled it. It is a 2. I’m going into next session with 5 out of 9 marked.
Rhi: Blaire, what do you wanna do for your downtime action?
Kim: I would like to lower my stress. I rolled double 5s, and let me see… That actually puts me back to 0 stress, so that works out.
Rhi: What do you do to indulge your vice?
Kim: I’m guessing that there are maybe one or two patrons from this auction who are at the same bar that Myra’s getting drunk at and Blaire’s tagging along and she’s just eavesdropping and occasionally saying one or two things about her hyper-fixation and having a great time.
Rhi: Yeah. They either seem to not notice or not care that you are a servant or a total stranger and they will happily chat with you about weird, spooky bullshit.
Kim: Yay.
Rhi: Minx?
Josie: Hi!
Rhi: Hi.
Josie: I think my downtime is to acquire an asset.
Rhi: Yeah?
Josie: And I think that asset will be a train crew uniform.
Minna: Ooh.
Rhi: Okay, nice. Let me see… Yeah, just go ahead and roll 2d6.
Josie: Okie-dokie, 5.
Rhi: Okay. That is gonna get you… your result is a 2, it’s the equivalent of your tier, and that was what I was thinking for the minimum quality level, would be a tier 2 asset. I think you just sneak over to the train station and break into the lockers of some of the staff.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: You lift a very nice, freshly ironed, I think dark green and silver is the train staff uniforms. It’s got the little hat. So yeah, you’ve got a nice, well-fitting uniform for the train. So, the end of this I imagine very frantic evening, you leave this party, there’s some running around town, you’ve all I guess reconvened in your hotel room. Myra is wine drunk, I believe?
Minna: [laughs] Yes.
Josie: Minx also has a glass of wine and she’s kind of flopped luxuriously on the couch because she’s ready to go to bed, but she also has a glass of wine and is listening to drunk Myra.
Minna: I think Myra’s flat on her back on the bed with her eyes on the ceiling.
Josie: [laughing] Aww.
Minna: [giggling] Where’s Blaire?
Kim: Uh… on the bed.
Minna: So she’s lying on the bed and she’s like:
Minna (as Myra): And they’re all here, these… they just, have you ever read any of the Whitehollow school? The poetry?
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Josie (as Minx): I haven’t.
Minna (as Myra): Written since the war?
Kim (as Blaire): I saw it when I was in Charterhall. I saw it on the library shelves, but I never picked it up.
Minna (as Myra): They put it in the library? Whoa. That librarian’s got some gumption, yeah. Point is…
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): The Whitehollow school, they just, some of the people who came back after the war who weren’t the same saw things that they didn’t wanna see, maybe. Some of them stayed here, they didn’t go home, and they’re just writing all of this beautiful, horrific, courageous stuff, things that are talking about how bad it was there, how bad it was for them, how bad it was, like, how bad the lie was that took them out there, and it’s just… I mean, I’m gonna have to show you some. I’ll have to show you Kelkashia by Night when we get back, and some of the Catherine Torquill stuff. I wish I had some of it with me, but I just didn’t even think about it. It’s okay. If you care about poetry I’ll show you when we’re back. It’s just very… And they’re out there somewhere, doing this right now, not too far from us, and that’s just so much to think about right now.
Rhi: So, the three of you are gonna get as much sleep as you can before you have to be at the train station at sunrise to get the first train out of Whitehollow to try to steal the Hand of Kotar before you all make it back to Duskwall and it is passed over to the Circle of Flame.
Josie: Yup.
Kim: I believe in us.

## Blooper [1:29:52]
Kim: And there was only one bed…
Rhi: There is only one bed, but there is also a couch.
Kim: [giggles]
Josie: Once again.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: I don’t think you can afford—
Minna: But there’s still one bed for two people.
Kim: Slow burn, 480K words.
[laughter]
Minna: Who about?!
Kim: Any of them you want, baby.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: [squirms]
Rhi: I mean, it wouldn’t be Myra.
[laughter]
Minna: Very true, it would not be Myra.
Rhi: Unless it’s—yeah, and it can’t be a slow burn friendship, because y’all are already very clearly friends.
Josie: Yeah, a fucking—
Kim: But there was only one bed!
[giggling]
Josie: A fucking Blaire-Minx slow burn would be weird.
Rhi: It would, yeah.
Minna: Listen, maybe we’re all in the sister zone.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: Yeah, but yeah, honestly that’s why."
"Season 3, Episode 6: The On the Rails Score Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter)
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. Or, more accurately, welcome to the early morning train from Whitehollow to Duskwall. Today’s episode is something I’ve been wanting to do in Magpies for ages: a heist set aboard a speeding train. I’ve run a few one-shots of Blades set aboard speeding trains, and they always seem to end more or less the same way. With a few explosions. So, you’ve got that to look forward to. One quick content note for the episode: as The Magpies are on this train in pursuit of the relic known as The Hand of Kotar, this episode does include a mobile, disembodied hand. The descriptions of the hand aren’t too graphic, at least in my opinion, and the hand is not bloody, but it is still there.
Other announcements. First, we have transcripts on The Magpies site through Season 2, Episode 10. Huge, huge thanks to the team of transcribers who have helped us get this far. Tyler, Lyra, Michelle and Pidge have been absolutely fantastic to work with.
Second, there are still tons of great ways to support the show. Reviews are always very deeply appreciated, and they’re a great way to help new fans find us. If you’d like to support us financially, you can buy a pin from our Shapeways store or you can back us on Patreon. Our Patreon backer drive is still going on. If we can get seven more backers, then all currently active backers will be entered into a drawing to win one of five Magpies pins. It would be awesome if we could hit 100 backers before the end of the year, so I can send the pins out first thing in January.
Third, as some of you may have seen on Twitter, I’m in the planning stages to launch a new podcast. Aid Another is going to be an advice show for RPG characters. The idea is that people, both players and GMs, will write letters as their characters, seeking advice on whatever problems those characters are facing. Then, I and a guest host will answer a few letters per episode. I’m going to start recording in January, but in order to do that I need letters. If you’re interested, there’s a link to the submission guidelines in the show notes.
Finally, before we get to the featured charity, I wanna take a moment to thank all of you. This is our last episode of 2019, and this year has been really incredible for the show. We broke 100,000 downloads, we got to do some cool collaborations, we started our third season and we’ve gotten some amazing art of all kinds from our fans. Creating The Magpies is a labor of love. There’s a lot of work that goes into it behind the scenes and the support that we get from all of you makes that work, so, so worth it. So, thank you all so very much for listening. We’re very glad to have you along with is.
Next, I’m going to tell you about this month’s featured charity, which is partly about a specific charity and partly about a specific issue in the US. As some of you may know, the Trump administration recently implemented new rules for SNAP benefits. SNAP is a program that allows people with low incomes to get financial help with buying food. Food insecurity is a major issue throughout the nation, and millions of people depend upon this support. These new rules would, in short, make it far more difficult for people to access the funds they need to feed themselves and their families. Money is always tight during the holidays, and there are hundreds of charities asking for your support. But, if you’re able, locate a local food bank or other food access program to donate to.
If you’re in Chicago, my personal request is support for the Glenwood Sunday Market. It’s a farmer’s market that I volunteer for and one of our core missions is to provide a food access program. The neighborhood that I live in has a food insecurity rate of about 30%. The Glenwood Sunday Market works to support people facing food insecurity through our SNAP matching program. For the six months out of the year that the farmer’s market is open, anyone who shops at our market with SNAP funds gets a triple match of money. That means if someone charges $25 to their SNAP account, we give them $75 to spend on food at the market. This year, we gave away $26,000, a $6000 increase over what we gave in 2018. We want to continue these programs in 2020, but the federal grants that provided a lot of our food access funding are in jeopardy. So, any donations you can make would be greatly appreciated.
If you can’t donate, please visit 5calls.org and contact your representatives about this critical issue, or see if you can find a food bank to volunteer with. Things are really hard right now, all around the world. It’s important to do what we can, even in the smallest ways, to take care of each other.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [0.05.39]
Rhi: We see Whitehollow, dimly illuminated by the rising sun, the broken shards. And as the sun is coming up, a train pulls out of the station, heading back along the coast towards Duskwall. And again, we find The Magpies in one of the train compartments. I imagine Myra, at least, may look a little worse for wear, having gotten rather wine drunk the night before.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: How are the other two looking?
Kim: Blaire’s fine.
Josie: Minx is look actively chipper. She’s excited for this job.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, so the situation is that The Hand of Kotar has already been sold to Lady Penderyn. You’re assuming that she did not come to collect it personally, she is rich enough that she has people to do that, but the Hand is somewhere on this train and presumably it’s going to be very swiftly transferred into a much high-security situation when you get back to Duskwall. So, ideally you would get your hands on it before the train, you know, returns to Duskwall. You will need to locate the hand, steal the hand, and maintain possession of the hand until you get back, because the train is going through the Deathlands and you can’t— I mean, you can leave the train.
Josie: You can’t ride off into the night.
Rhi: Right. You could leave the train, but it would be a very, very dangerous and potentially deadly situation to do so.
Kim: No, it’d be fine. I’m the Deathlands expert.
Rhi: You, yeah. Blaire, you have ventured into the Deathlands before, but that’s been, like, day trips. Depending on where you make your exit, you could be spending weeks out there.
Kim: Oh fuck. And we’re not equipped for that.
Rhi: [laughs] No. So, that’s kinda the situation that you have before you and I think that previously I had said that the trip between Duskwall and Whitehollow is somewhere between 18 and 20 hours. So, that is the amount of time that you have to get this thing and then keep it safe, and yourselves safe, before you reach Duskwall.
Josie: Yes. I believe our best chance may be to initiate a plan that ultimately takes place within the last hour or so, so that they won’t have time to notice an absence or conduct any sort of reasonable search before arriving in town, at which point we can slink off.
Rhi: And if you do have to bail out into the Deathlands, it is a much shorter walk back.
Josie: Yes. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I mean you can also use some of the time that you have kind of before you implement your plan to try and gather some info.
Josie: Yes.
Minna: Yeah, absolutely. We need to do that.
Rhi: Yeah. However you all wanna start in on this.
Josie: Yes. I think I want to socialize in the dining car. I wanna know who’s on this train, and who’s who on this train.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, you can absolutely do that.
Josie: Because this is, like, fancy people train, right?
Rhi: So, it is a mix of passenger and cargo types, because there’s not a ton of trains running back and forth, so they kinda load up one train with as much as they can. But there are definitely, like, fancy rich people cars.
Kim: So, it’s basically the Titanic.
Rhi: Uh, yes, yeah. Yeah. Except ideally will not crash spectacularly and—
Kim: Into an iceberg.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: If this train, if you all run this train into an iceberg, [laughs] something has gone horribly wrong.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Minx, do you want to start off by doing your socializing? Since it’s pretty early, I imagine you could get in there for like a, you know, breakfast or brunch.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Chat with folks.
Josie: And like, I don’t wanna press my luck on finding actual information on the Hand just yet. I want to know who is here, who could maybe be carrying it.
Rhi: Yeah. Absolutely. What are you gonna roll to do that?
Josie: I’m gonna go with a Sway.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: 5, okay. So, standard amount of information. So yeah, you head into the, you know, one of the dining cars for breakfast. There’s definitely eggs, because chickens are still a thing.
Kim: They are?
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: I think in the, like, ‘What is There to Eat in Duskwall’ section, it mentions chickens.
Kim: Why have we never eaten chicken, then? Why has that never been an option?
Rhi: I dunno, because I forget?
[laughter]
Kim: Okay. I just, I feel like we bend over backwards to come up with these weird-ass foods and I’m learning just today that we had chicken.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: You know?
Josie and Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Anyway, there’s eggs.
Rhi: Yeah, there’s eggs. Um, yeah, there’s probably, I mean, there’s probably like a mushroom-flour bread. I don’t know what else. Oh, maybe chicken sausage. It’s nice. It’s a nice breakfast. And you got a 5. I think as you are mingling there’s a table of about six people, kind of off in a back corner of the car, keeping to themselves, pretty much. They’re not really engaging with you very much. Very, like, they’re polite, but they’re cold and they’re not really inviting you to join them. And I think as you are kind of inconspicuously lurking in their vicinity, you hear one of them basically telling two of the people at the table, you know:
Rhi (as Train Passenger): As soon as we finish here you two are on first shift. Keep an eye on it, we need to make sure that this stays secure.
Rhi: Things like that. Basically kind of giving security instructions.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: And I think as you’re walking away, that person who was giving the directions kind of, you know, makes a gesture with their hand and you can see on the back of their wrist is a tattoo in the symbol of the Fallen Star, that you’ve seen a few other places.
Josie: Ah.
Rhi: Specifically tied to Lady Penderyn.
Josie: I see. Alright, that’s good to know. Okay, and these aren’t train staff? These are guests?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: Okay. That’s good to know, because it means the train staff isn’t necessarily in on it.
Rhi: Mm hmm. So, Myra or Blaire, you have any info you want to try to gather?
Minna: I’m assuming that, like, servants kind of go to breakfast with, like, everyone else who’s not in the fancy dining car?
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, there is a second class.
Minna: So, I’m just gonna go sit in the second class dining car and just kind of people-watch. And see if I can spot anyone who seems likely to be involved.
Rhi: Okay. Um, yeah. Go ahead and give me a roll.
Minna: God, I think it’s Study.
Rhi: Study makes sense, yeah.
Minna: 4.
Rhi: 4. Okay. So again, standard amount of information. So, you hang out in the second class coach, whatever you wanna call it, dining car, and initially nobody in there really seems to be connected to the Penderyn travelling party. But then after a little bit, two people cut through, walking down the train. You’ve been around, you know, doing this whole criminal thing for a while. You recognize this is people who are a little better armed and armored than one would expect for morning on a train. It’s the equivalent of, “Oh, they have a normal load.” [laughs]
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: So, you spot these two people kind of moving briskly through the train car on their way elsewhere. You can, with that kind of standard amount of information, you can follow them to see where they end up.
Minna: Okay. I am going to do that.
Rhi: So, you trail them kind of through the rest of the passenger car area, and then you get to a point where there is a member of the train staff standing at a door. Like, you have to stay back a little ways, so you can’t see exactly what happens, but the two of them talk to the staff member who’s posted there. One of them shows the employee, like, a folded piece of paper. They look at it, they nod, they open, like, they unlock that door, and then the two of them continue on. And then the train staff closes the door and relocks it. So, there’s some kinda secure area that they head into further down, that you would not be able to follow because you would be spotted.
Minna: Uh huh. At least I know where it is. Where is it in relation to the rest of the train, again?
Rhi: I am gonna pretend I know, like, I know how train works. How trains work. I’m gonna pretend I can speak, too.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: I feel like it could have a car to itself or something? I don’t know.
Rhi: Well, so what I’m picturing is that there’s like, the, so there’s the engine, I think like the front probably third of the train is kind of the passenger cars and then the rest of it is cargo.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Based on what you saw when you were boarding the train, like, the back third are kinda those open cars of, like, heaps of coal and other stuff like that. So, it’s probably not that far back. So, somewhere in the middle third of the train, you’re guessing, is where it’s being stored.
Minna: Yeah, and then, like, because I’ve seen where the checkpoint is, I at least can guess where on the train the checkpoint is and make that mental note and stuff.
Rhi: Yes, yeah, you know exactly how to get to that security checkpoint area. Blaire, any info you wanna gather?
Kim: That’s a good question, dude.
Minna: I have an idea.
Kim: Yeah?
Minna: You could look into how to navigate outside the train.
Rhi: Yeah, see if you can chat with any of the Rail Jacks.
Kim: Uh, sure.
Rhi: Cause, like, I fele you have to also have that similar kind of very weird limited regard for self-preswrvation thing that Blaire’s got going to decide that that’s the career path you want.
Josie: [laughs] Right.
Kim: Eh, yeah.
Rhi: “I wanna stand on top of a moving train and fight ghosts, yeah!”
Kim: Yeah, but also they fight ghosts instead of, you know, helping them. Anyway, this is probably gonna be a Consort.
Rhi: Yeah, probably.
Kim: Cool, I got a 3 and a 2.
Rhi: So, you get limited information. I think you are able to, I think there’s like a bar, a train car that’s just a bar.
Kim: Oh, dope.
Rhi: And I think you’re able to find your way in there. You find a, you know, I think just a single off-durty Railjack, strike up a conversation with them and I think kind of exactly the sort of hesitance that you had about talking to them is what makes this not as useful, is that Bliare kind of starts to get on her soapbox about, like—
Kim (as Blaire): Ghost rights!
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] But you do get a little bit of information. You basically learn that the Rail Jacks kinda have their own, sort of, access points to the outside of the train. There are doors set in some of the cars that they can open and climb out onto. They tend to have, kind of like, harnesses that they use to, like, attach themselves to the cars so they don’t fall off while they are zipping along very fast.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: But you don’t really get much more than that. Yeah, I think that’s pretty much what you get, is that there is this way of moving along the train on the outside, but not a ton of other details.
Kim: I tried.
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, it is more information than you had previously. Any other info you wanna try to gather?
Josie: How— I don’t know what the transfers between cars look like in this situation. I imagine they’re flexibly covered?
Rhi: What do they… how do trains work? It’s been so long since I’ve been on a train.
Josie: Fucking trains, how do they work?
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] I think that there is a, like, I’m picturing kind of like a weather-proofed canvas between the cars so that it can, you know, bend and flex when the train goes around a bend. What info are you trying to…
Josie: I’m just trying to figure out what the line of sight for the Rail Jacks would be.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Josie: Because that’s the problem with crawling outside the train, is that there’s already gonna be people there.
Rhi: Yes. There are not really a lot of lights on the train itself. The Rail Jacks do have kind of lanterns that they carry, but it’s also very dark out. So, it’s something where, like, if the train is going straight you can theoretically see from one end of the train to the other, but in practice there is not enough light to really see more than, like, one or two cars at a time.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: I think Blaire could have probably gotten that with her roll.
Josie: So, like, sneaking is conceivably possible.
Rhi: Absolutely, yeah. Dangerous, extremely dangerous, but very doable in terms of not getting spotted.
Josie: Right. Yeah, I think I might need a moment to think on how to actually formulate a plan here and what we need to know.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Because a lot of the old train heist clichés are not feasible.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Cannot ride up with horses and make them stop.
Josie: Yeah. How close to the passenger area is the cargo area? Is it one cargo car, or?
Rhi: No, there’s a ton of cargo cars.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: This is a huge, huge long train. And it’s think it’s like the fancy people are up at the very front of the train and then you’ve got the people who have less money, that’s kinda where you all have been, and then there’s the cargo area of the train. So…
Josie: Hmm. Yeah. I mean we could just do that… yeah, we might just need to do that in the last hour or so, so people don’t have time to discover the crime scene, I guess.
Rhi: Planning on posing as staff or sneaking around the outside?
Josie: Posing as staff, letting the other two in and then dealing with what comes in there, I guess.
Rhi: How does that sound to the other two?
Kim: That works for me.
Minna: Okay.
Josie: Weirdly, it almost sounds too easy.
Rhi: I mean, it’s not too terribly different than, you know, breaking into a house back in Duskwall. You know, you don’t know exactly what’s in the house, you scout the outside of it then get in and find out what’s waiting for you.
Josie: Right. In that scenario, you have the bugging out option.
Rhi: Yes. [laughs] Yeah.
Josie: Here we don’t have that.
Rhi: Yeah, the stakes are a bit higher. Yeah, so, um…
Josie: I think… okay, I think the plan is, yeah, we just need to all pose as staff, relieve the guard on duty, let us all in and then I think maybe, yeah, let’s start with that.
Rhi: Then I think that’s where we’ll start. Okay so let’s figure out the engagement roll. One for luck. “Is this operation particularly bold or daring?” I feel like trying to steal a super powerful artifact on a speeding train through inhospitable wilderness is pretty daring.
Josie: Yeah. Yeah, let’s go with that. [laughs]
Rhi: “Any other elements you want to consider?” I think just the higher stakes of the whole train situation is making this just a much riskier prospect than normal. So, it’s gonna be a one die roll. And I shall roll it. Hmm.
Josie: That sounds like a 1.
Minna: That doesn’t sound good.
Rhi: That does. It sounds exactly like a 1, actually.
Minna: Oh no!
Kim: Fuck!
Josie: Oh, God dammit.
Rhi: Yeah. Alright, so you’re in a desperate position when the action starts. So, Minx, you change into your very snappy conductor uniform. It’s dark green, you got the little hat.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Blaire and Myra, I assume you’re kinda hanging back a little bit to wait for Minx to get the door open. And as you are making your way up towards the door, you see there’s two guards— or not, so, there’s two of the people that you saw at breakfast. They are like Lady Penderyn’s, some of her personal guards that she sent. So when I refer to guards, that’s who I mean. There’s two of them standing outside of the door at the security checkpoint. And then the person that you saw who had the tattoo, the Fallen Star tattoo, is standing there talking to the two guards and the train staff member. And you kinda get close enough to hear what’s being said, and it’s like:
Rhi (as Penderyn’s Guard): No, I’ve compared their faces to the sketches that I was given by our employer and I am 90% certain. The Magpies are on this train, and I am sure that they are going to make some kind of attempt before we reach Duskwall. Be on high alert, do not let anyone through this door.
Minna: Woah.
Josie: Oh heavens. Okay, real quick. Poll from the team, because this is kind of an impulse decision. Do we just fucking launch into it and take them out now? Before they can, like, search and identify us? Or do we back off and try something else?
Minna: I think we could back off and try something else and not get stuck trying to fight people in a metal tube. Because that could go poorly.
Josie: Yeah, okay. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Minx probably, like, leans forward like she’s gonna do it, and then Myra’s just like, “No, no.” [laughs]
Minna: She wraps a hand around her arm.
Josie: Yep.
Minna: Silently.
Josie (as Minx): Back to the drawing board.
Rhi: So, what is Plan B?
Josie: Uh… well. I think Plan B is going around the outside now.
Rhi: [laughs] So, I think you fall back a couple cars and are able to find one of the hatches that the Rail Jacks use. So, this’ll probably be, like, there will be a series of rolls as you’re navigating down the train. If you do not have climbing gear, like, each of you would need to mark climbing gear, if you don’t, it’s gonna be desperate. If you do mark climbing gear you can hook yourselves onto the train and it will just be risky.
Josie: I’m gonna mark off climbing gear.
Minna: I’m marking climbing gear.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Kim: Uh, climbing gear.
Rhi: Climbing gear takes two slots of your load. You’re able to kinda open up the hatch. I think, like, having Minx there in the uniform makes people be like, “Oh, well I guess this is fine. They’re supposed to be opening that thing, sure.” [laughs]
Josie: This is fine.
Rhi: So yeah, you get the hatch open. There is immediately just, you know, rushing wind as the train is zipping along. You all gonna climb on out?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. I think to start moving up the train I’m gonna need some kinda group check, probably.
Josie: Group Prowl probably?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. Most likely Prowl.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Who’s got the stress to spare?
Kim: I do.
Minna: I sure don’t.
Josie: Blaire, how about you lead us on this one then?
Kim: Okey dokey. Oh, 6.
Josie: I got a 5.
Minna: 3.
Rhi: Okay, so Blaire is gonna take one point of stress, but the result is a 6.
Josie: Woo!
Kim: Run the fuck outta that train.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Yeah, so what I picture for this is that there’s, like, metal cables that run down along the length of each car, and you’ve just got little, like, things that you kinda clip yourself onto these cables. So, you kinda hook yourselves in, climb up to the very narrow catwalk running along the edge, running along kinda the top edge of the cars, and start making your way down. I think that Myra, with your earlier Gather Info, you kind of know how many cars to count until you pass over the security checkpoint. Which, they didn’t really put anything on the outside of the car, because who would be crazy enough—
[laughter]
Rhi: To do this? And yeah, I think you’re able to, you make it over that security checkpoint on the outside of the car. Now, there are still dozens more cars ahead of you and you are not sure which one contains the Hand. You have some options before you, but you’re past that checkpoint now on the outside of a speeding train, hurtling through the darkness.
Josie: Woo!
Minna: Would an Attune roll help anything?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. If you or Blaire, I know you two are both pretty good at Attune, an artifact like this would be pretty noticeable in the ghost field.
Kim: Okay. I’m gonna roll Attune, because this is gonna be my first time rolling with a 3 in Attune.
Rhi: Ooh, nice. So this is gonna be risky, great effect because you’ve got your fine spirit mask.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 1, a 3 and a 6.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] Good thing you had that third die.
Kim: Phew!
Rhi: Describe what Blaire looks like as she is, you know, peering into the ghost field while clinging to the top of this speeding train. How does this look?
Kim: She uses one free hand, I’m gonna say just for convenience sake her mask is already— she usually, like, keeps it on her shoulder. I’m gonna say that it’s already on the top of her head, kind of like that, that thing that shields your eyes when you’re welding?
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Oh, yeah.
Kim: So, she kinda just brings it down. The spaces where, you know, her eyes would be start to glow.
Rhi: So, you peer into the ghost field, looking down the train, and it is pretty obvious what your target is. You can sort of see, like, there’s flickers out in the Deathlands of, you know, spirits. You can see, way off in the distance, a brighter glow that’s probably a spirit well. But on the train, there’s not a ton of stuff that has ghostly, spiritual signatures, except about six cars down from where you are. There is this section that is just sort of glowing like a beacon. It’s too large to just be the Hand. It looks like there’s a number of arcane wards in this car, but there is, it’s all surrounding something. And you can see, kind of in the midst of all those wards, there’s a small shape that is glowing very brightly in there. And you got about six more cars to cover.
Josie: That’s a long ways.
Kim (as Blaire): A little bit, six cars ahead, but I think that’s it!
Josie (as Minx): That simple, huh?
Kim (as Blaire): It’s— [giggles excitedly] it’s the closest we’ve ever been. We’re on the same vehicle as it!
Josie (as Minx): That… that is true, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m just excited, okay? We’re gonna get it.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, we are. And we should get moving.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: So, I think give me another group prowl roll to make sure that you get to your targeted car safely.
Kim: I can lead again.
Josie: Okey dokey.
Kim: Hah hah!
Minna: 3.
Kim: 2.
Josie: Got a 3…
Kim: Oh nooooo!
Minna: Oh, we, no!
Rhi: Oh boy. Okay.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: So, you all start making your way down the cars. You get through the first one, two. You make it onto the third car, so you’re about halfway. You’re halfway to your target. And there’s a clang from below, behind you, and then another one ahead of you. And you kind of look around as it’s a mix of— there’s two guards from Penderyn’s group and two Rail Jacks who have been sort of drafted into assisting with this, all come scrambling up the ladders. They are hooked onto the cables as well. You’ve got two on either side of this car, so you’re boxed in, and I think one of the Rail Jacks has a lightning hook in her hands, one of the big long ones on a pole, and kinda raises it and is like:
Rhi (as Rail Jack): If you come quietly—
Rhi: And one of Penderyn’s guards is like:
Rhi (as Penderyn’s Guard): Shut up. There’s no surrender here.
Rhi: And is gonna raise a pistol.
Minna: Oh.
Rhi: You all are in a desperate situation.
Josie: Oh dear.
Minna: This person just wants to murder us.
Rhi: You are surrounded by people who want you dead, yeah. So, yeah, this is desperate. There’s four of them, there’s three of you, you’re on top of a speeding car in pretty much pitch blackness. I imagine that one of you has a lantern. The two Rail Jacks have lanterns. So, there’s very, like, flickery, spooky light.
Josie: Uh huh. I think Minx is gonna look at either end.
Josie (as Minx): Well. I think it’s time to say goodnight.
Josie: And she’s gonna blow out our lantern.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay.
Josie: And try and pull everyone down to, like, hit the deck.
Rhi: Okay. That’s gonna be some sort of roll. So, you’re trying to basically hide where you all are, trying to kind of… right?
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Like, first it’s blow out the lantern, have everyone hit the deck, and like, maybe make this confused.
Rhi: Yeah, no, no, that totally works. Yeah, give me some kind of a roll. Do you have— I know there’s a Cutter ability that has to do with, um…
Josie: Yes. Bodyguard. “When you protect a teammate, take plus one die on the resistance roll.”
Rhi: Okay. I am gonna say that this— I might still, if you end up taking—
Josie: This could be a setup action, maybe?
Rhi: Yeah… it could be. I think because this feels protective to me, so even though it’s not officially that move, I’m gonna say that if you take a consequence from this I am still gonna give you that plus one die on your resistance roll.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: So, yeah. So whatever you’re gonna roll.
Josie: Can I make a case for Consort? Cause I’m kind of relying on my teammates here to be up to speed on what I’m doing, a little bit? Or should it be, like, Sway because I’m sowing confusion?
Rhi: Um, I mean… hmm.
Minna: It is very theatrical.
Rhi: Yeah… honestly, I could… you made a solid argument for both. I would allow you to do either one.
Josie: Cool. Alright, well I’m gonna do Sway, then.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Because I got that sweet, sweet four dice.
Rhi: Yeah, if you’re trying to create confusion, I will allow Sway for that.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: 5. Okay. You do it but there’s a consequence. Okay, so you blow out the lantern, drag your teammates to the ground. Both Myra and Blaire are safe and unharmed. However, as you were dropping, that guard who had said, you know, basically kill them all, fires and it catches you in the back.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: So, you’re gonna take level 3 harm.
Josie: Okay. Well, yep, that’s a resistance roll if I ever saw one.
Rhi: Yes. [laughs] That’s gonna be Prowess, and I will give you that bonus die for your Bodyguard.
Josie: In which case, that’s five dice.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Got a 4 only, though.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: Still, so you’ll take 2 stress and that’ll drop it to a level 2 harm. So, you’re still kinda hecked up. Not as bad as it coulda been. It’s a question of did the bullet, like, go through your side and mess up your ribs, or did it hit you in the spine.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, yeah. You’re shot, but still functional. But really any kind of physical rolls, you’re gonna be at a minus one die.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Dangit, I was hoping he would fire and hit one of the Rail Jacks. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, so Blaire or Myra?
Kim: I have an idea.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Let me just… I’m gonna mark off throwing knives and what I wanna do with that is while I’m, you know, pulled to the ground— here’s how I’m picturing this. Blaire is, like, face-down on the roof of the train and she grabs a throwing knife and she is going to aim and throw it at, I dunno, any of the guards that she can hit. And aim for their legs in hopes of throwing them off balance and pretty much, you know, getting them off the train.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Minna: Are there— are they linked to the same ropes as us, or their own ropes? Because we could also go for their ropes.
Kim: Oh, that’s even cooler.
Rhi: So, the way that I’m picturing it is that there are… so you got the train car. On either side, running longway, there is like a steel cable that’s anchored to the end of each car. So, they are hooked on, all of you are hooked on to those. There’s two cables, all of you are hooked onto one of the other of them.
Minna: But what is hooking us to the cables?
Rhi: Yeah, there’s basically, like, a line that everybody has hooked onto their belt, and then it’s like a line running from your belt to the cable that you kinda hook a carabiner onto.
Minna: Go for their lines.
Kim: Yeah, that’s what I’m gonna do.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: So, would what you say this roll would be?
Rhi: Could be Hunt, could be Skirmish. It is gonna be… it’s still gonna be desperate, and I think it’s gonna be reduced effect because you’re doing this in near-total darkness.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: It’s a tough shot to make. Also, don’t forget, Josie, to mark experience for that desperate roll you did.
Josie: Oh, yay.
Kim: Well, either one, doesn’t really matter because I have a one in both of those skills.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: So I’m going to roll Skirmish.
Rhi: Okay. Do you wanna push yourself, do you want a Devil’s Bargain?
Minna: I will say go ahead and take an assist from me. I forgot I have an ability that lets me grant two free assists.
Kim: Oh, thank you. Okay.
Rhi: Alright.
Kim: Oh! That’s a crit. That’s two 6s.
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: [laughs] Holy shit! That’s awesome.
Kim: [screams] What the fuck!
Rhi: So, the result of it is going to be that not only does Blaire make the throw, you’re gonna cut this guy’s line, but he’s falling off the train.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: So, describe how does Blaire accomplish this thing.
Kim: The way that she was able to get pinpoint accuracy is that she still has her spirit mask on, which helps, which double-serves as night vision goggles, really. So, she has no problem. I imagine she, like, curves the knife, in a way, and it spins a little but the blades does hit the line. And it just…
Rhi: I think that it’s like as the train is going around a turn. So like, the people who are still standing kind of have to lean a little bit to maintain their balance, so the line had gone real taut, and when it snaps he completely loses his balance and just goes end over end, falls off the train, you know, there’s just kind of a scream that cuts off very abruptly.
Josie: Oof.
Kim: I killed a guy. [laughs] Cool.
Rhi: Congratulations.
Josie: [sings Bohemian Rhapsody] Mama…
[laughter]
Rhi: We’ll deal with that later.
Kim: [sings Bohemian Rhapsody] Oo-oo-ooh…
Minna: Truly a killer meme.
Josie: Was that one of the guards or one of the Rail Jacks?
Rhi: Which one do you want to have killed, Blaire?
Kim: You know what? One of the Rail Jacks. For killing a ghost, probably.
Rhi: Okay. Well, now they will be a ghost. Myra, what would you like to do in this moment?
Minna: I would like to also be cutting lines.
Rhi: Okay, go for it. How do you want to go about doing this?
Minna: I would like to Skirmish about it.
Rhi: Okay so are you gonna close in and try and do it at, like, melee range?
Minna: Yeah. Oh. Ah! I also crit-ed.
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Wow. Okay, who are you targeting?
Minna: I think I went to the opposite side from Blaire.
Rhi: Okay. There’s one Penderyn guard and one Rail Jack over there, so do you want—
Minna: Penderyn guard.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think it’s the same thing, I think— the guy’s going over the side, does he fall or do you push him?
Minna: I mean, they both want to kill us.
Rhi: Yeah. So, I think, yeah, Myra under cover of darkness zips over, cuts that guy’s line and gives him a shove. Yeah. So, you’re down to one Rail Jack and one guard. And the Rail Jack, who is now on the opposite, like, so there’s one guard on one side, one Rail Jack on the other. I think the Rail Jack— this is not in their job description and they are gonna leave. They’re not going back inside, they’re just heading down further along the train cars. You’re not sure if they’re going to get backup or if they’re just bailing, but they’re departing from this situation. [laughs] They just saw two people get shoved off the train to their deaths and they’re not sticking around to be the third. So, I don’t know if anybody wants to do something about that, but one person is leaving.
Josie: Well, I think we’re gonna need a Hand to get out of this situation.
Kim: Eyy! [laughs]
Josie: Ehh! [laughs]
Kim: [sings comedy backing music] Ba da da, da da…
Rhi: [laughs] I’m sorry to all of our listeners and loyal fans, The Magpies is over.
Kim and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: I’m cancelling the show. I cannot work in these conditions.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Are you doing anything about the fleeing Rail Jack or are you gonna let them go?
Josie: I think I let them go.
Kim: I feel like there’s consequences if we let them go.
Minna: Throw something after them.
Kim: Yeah, you know what? Blaire’s gonna try and do a murder again.
Josie: Okay… [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): We take no prisoners.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Jesus.
Josie: [laughs] Oh no…
Kim (as Blaire): They work for the bourgeoisie. I thought we were all on the same page.
Kim: Okay. That’s a 5.
Rhi: You do it, but there’s a consequence. So, I think what happens is you throw your next throwing knife and it does catch them on the arm and they kinda stumble a little bit, but they are gonna keep going and the consequence is that I am going to start a clock—
Kim: No!
Rhi: For Reinforcements Arrive.
Josie and Minna: [groan]
Kim: This is why I wanted to kill him, because I knew if he got away he was gonna, like, pull an alarm or something.
Rhi: It’s at 1 out of 6. There is one guard left.
Minna: Is this the one who wanted to shoot us?
Rhi: Uh, yeah.
Minna: Alright. Somebody has to square up against the shooty guy.
Josie: Oh, there’s still someone left?
Rhi: There’s one guard left, yeah.
Josie: Oh. Yeah, I’m gonna shoot him.
[laughter]
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: It is risky, but reduced effect due to the darkness.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: 5, okay. I think you hit him, but it’s a glancing shot. And I think he is also going to book it to go look for reinforcements. So that clock is gonna tick up another 1. So, you all are at 2 out of 6. However, no one is currently impeding your progress forward.
Josie: Yeah, I think we should just get to the car so at the least, we can fight whatever comes not on the roof of a speeding train.
Rhi: So, here’s what I’m gonna give you, because Minx did get shot in the back and is slowed down by the fact that she got shot in the back. You can either have Blaire and Myra help her and go slower, but it’s gonna tick up the clock, or Minx can make a roll to try and keep up with all of you.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna try that roll anyway, because reckless.
Rhi: I’m gonna borrow something from the Band of Blades game that we did, where this is not necessarily gonna be, like, an ability roll. I think I’m just gonna have you make a Prowess roll. Not like a resistance roll, but just roll Prowess to see how well you can manage this.
Josie: Okay. I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. It hurts, and you’re gonna pay for this later, but you are able to run along the top of the train cars, keep up with the other two. I have a mental image, I’m just trying to put it into words. So, you have two options for how you can get back into the interior of the train. One of them is another Rail Jack entrance hatch which is in the car right in front of the one that you want. So it will not put you directly in the car and there may be other security on that door that you’d have to deal with. Or you can try to cut your way through the, kind of, that canvas covering that’s between the cars and try to climb down that way. The first way will not require a roll, you’ll just be able to do it, but then you’ll have to deal with the door. The second way will require a roll, but will probably get you past at least the first layer of security.
Josie: I kinda like going for the canvas.
Minna: Me too.
Rhi: Okay. How do you wanna handle that?
Josie: I mean, we have no shortage of knives.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Although just to be sure, can someone lend me a hand?
Minna: Yeah. Take my second free assist. Unless you meant a group action.
Josie: I meant a pun. But— [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. I heard it.
Minna: Oh, I’m so sorry.
Rhi: I heard it and I sighed, but I wasn’t gonna draw further attention to it.
Minna: I thought you were actually asking,
Josie: Oh, am I getting cold shouldered now? Is that what’s happening? [laughs]
Rhi: I will remember this when you ask for a Devil’s Bargain next.
Josie: No, we don’t need the free assist, I don’t think.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: This is probably, I’m thinking, Prowl.
Josie: Okey dokey.
Rhi: Because this is a physical thing. And you are gonna take the penalty, the one die penalty, on this.
Josie: Makes sense.
Rhi: Okay, 4. So I think that in order to do this in a way that doesn’t involve you plummeting to your death you have to do it slowly, and I’m gonna tick up that clock again. So, the Reinforcements Arrive is now at 3 out of 6. But you all are able to kind of climb down into this little space between the cars. You unhook your climbing gear.
Josie (as Minx): Well that was difficult, but I think I got a hand-le on it.
[long pause]
Rhi: [sighs]
Josie: [laughs] Just dead silence. I’m really sorry.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I didn’t know it hurt that bad.
Rhi: Anyway. So, you all climb down into the space between the cars. Looking at the door that you would have had to break through if you had just gone in through the hatch, it’s a pretty serious door with like, you can see kind of the back side of spark-craft security systems on there. There’s a pretty intense lock on it. So, like, that would have been a difficult thing to get through.
The next door that leads into the car, it is also locked but it has, like, a… one of those windows that has, like, wire through it so it won’t— you can’t just shatter it and open the lock, but you can see. And what you see inside of this room, it’s pretty well lit, there are several kind of metal crates that seem to be bolted to the ground, and in the middle of the car is a cage, floor to ceiling, that the bars look like they’re electrified. There’s little zaps of electricity jumping between them. And there are two guards inside, sitting in chairs near the cage.
Josie: Would it be possible to intentionally set off the security measures on this door? So that they might come to investigate?
Rhi: Oh. Yes, you could do that. You could deliberately set the alarms so that they would come investigate.
Josie: I don’t really have Tinker, so that might be up to Blaire.
Kim: Yeah, I can give a stab at it.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, that’s a 3.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, instead of setting off the alarms, you just pick the lock. Quietly.
Minna and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: And the door, like, you kinda weren’t expecting it, the door swings open and the two guards look to see you crouched there, lockpicks still in hand, Minx and Myra standing behind you. And so, whatever element of surprise might have been there is lost.
[laughter]
Kim: Oh.
Josie (as Minx): Right! Time for guns.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] So, I think that the consequence here is that you all are back in a desperate situation as the two of them lunge to their feet and go for their own weapons.
Josie: Uh, yep, I’m shooting at them as best I can.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Myra, now can I have that free assist?
Minna: Yes.
Josie and Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Yeah, you shoot at one of the guards and you hit him. I don’t think it takes them out, these are pretty, like, beefy, well-equipped individuals, but he is badly injured. And yeah, what would the other two of you like to do? Minx has just shot somebody.
Kim: Um..
Minna: Uh…
Kim: Hmm.
Minna: I feel like we have to shoot the other one.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: That would be a solid solution.
Minna: Although I’ve already marked three things and one of them is a blade, so maybe I’m gonna go fight him.
Rhi: Okay. You gonna go do a stabbin’.
Minna: 5.
Rhi: So, I think you’re getting shot.
Josie: [gasps]
Rhi: That is gonna be level 3 harm.
Minna: I’m gonna resist it.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay. So, you’ll just take one stress then, and that’ll drop it down to a level 2.
Minna: Where was I shot?
Rhi: Like, in the shoulder. So, you are also gonna be taking penalties on some physical actions. Okay, Blaire, what do you wanna do?
Kim: Do a shoot.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, this is, I think if you’re staying in the door it’ll be risky.
Kim: That’s fine. I’ll take risky, because I already rolled a 3.
Rhi: So, I think you fire, but as you pull the trigger, the train kinda like shifts on the tracks and your shot goes wild, and it hits something that sets off that alarm you wanted to set off earlier.
Kim: Oh, come on!
Rhi: So, Reinforcements Arrive is now at 4 out of 6. Yeah, so you’ve got two guards. One is injured but still capable of shooting a gun. Reinforcements are on their way. What do you wanna do?
Josie: I wanna finish off the guy who’s still standing.
Rhi: Okay. Then take your shot. It’s gonna be risky, I think, for you at this point, too. Myra’s the only one who’s still in a desperate position because she has two people pointing guns at her.
Josie: 6 again.
Rhi: Nice. Okay, that is gonna— are you shooting to maim or shooting to kill?
Josie: Uh… shooting to kill.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Well, yeah, I think you get him square in the chest and he topples over and that’s it. Fortunately, it usually takes a few days for ghosts to appear, so that’s not gonna be an immediate concern.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, so one of the guards has been taken out. Myra, do you wanna try and tangle with this other guy?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. And it’s up to a risky position now, since you’re just facing him one-on-one.
Minna: I’m gonna roll. Fuck me, it’s a 3.
Rhi: Oh no, what did you get? A 3? Um, so I think that…
Minna: Can I suggest something?
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: Or at least part of it is that when I got shot I dropped my knife, so I, like, basically try to punch the wound and get my wrist caught.
Rhi: Okay, yes. So he’s, like, got you in a grapple basically?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, I like that. I think this is gonna put you back in a desperate position. He still has his gun. I think you grabbed for it and now the two of you are just wrestling over that, but he is armed and is less injured than you and I think is just, like, physically bigger. So, you’re in the weaker position here. So, desperate is where you’re back at as you’re wrestling with this guy. Blaire?
Kim: Yeah… I can try shooting again?
Rhi: You could. Do you want a Devil’s Bargain?
Kim: Let me hear it, yeah.
Rhi: This is the last shot. This is the last bullet that you’ve got. You didn’t pack a ton of ammo cause you weren’t expecting to have to do a lot of shooting.
Kim: And I don’t use guns, like, ever. So yeah, that’s fair. I’ll take it.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. So basically, after this shot your gun is gonna be dead weight.
Kim: Okay. That’s a 5.
Rhi: He got injured already. Again, are you shooting to injure or kill? [laughs]
Kim: Murder.
Rhi: Jesus.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Blaire’s gotten a taste for blood. I’m concerned, I feel like we’re gonna need to have a conversation.
Kim: [laughs] Uh— it’s— listen— she fucking wants this and…
Josie: Yes, and that—
Rhi: Listen, the fact that Blaire is willing to murder people to get this artifact is worrying.
Josie: Yes.
Kim: Well, and also, people are coming. So…
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: I’m trying to up our chances.
Rhi: I’m not saying it’s a bad thing. I’m just saying it’s, like, it’s a character choice. Yeah, so Blaire, I think like, is standing there, gets an opening and fires, and this guy also topples over. Myra, I think, staggers a little bit because there’s suddenly not resistance. And yeah, for the moment, you are alone in this train car with two bodies. And this big, electrified cage.
Josie: Is it… what’s in the cage?
Rhi: Looking past the bars, you can see that there is a fairly small, I would say, like, a foot on all sides, wooden crate. Just resting on the floor. There’s a large label on the top of it that you can’t read what it says, but it has Lady Penderyn’s, like, house sigil stamped onto it.
Josie (as Minx): Alright. Well, this might be your expertise, Blaire, in getting us through this.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Let me take a crack at it.
Kim: Is this gonna be some kind of like Attune thing? Or Tinker?
Rhi: I think we’ve said previously that you can, like, see that in the ghost field. I don’t know that you’ve tried to manipulate electricity via Attune, but it’s a thing that is doable.
Kim: I am going to try that because I have three dice in Attune.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: That sounds better than rolling one dice this whole time.
Rhi: Yeah, go ahead and give it a shot. It is still risky.
Kim: Mm hmm. Are you goddamn fucking kidding me?
Josie and Rhi: Oh no.
Kim: 3, 3, 2.
Rhi: You can hear people are at the other side of the door. Reinforcements are one tick away.
Kim: We’re gonna fucking die…
Rhi: And clamoring at the door.
Kim: We were so close.
Josie: I have demolition tools.
Kim: I was gonna say, what if we blew up the train?
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Yeah!
Kim: What if we went full Uncharted on this?
Rhi: This also happens frequently when I run train heists. Continue.
Josie: I want to set up the demolition stuff by the door. And, you know, as soon as anyone tries to come through, just—
Rhi: Blow it?
Josie: Yeah. Blow that shit up.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, this is gonna be risky, obviously. Yeah, and I’m assuming Wreck is what you’re going for here?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Do you want a Devil’s Bargain?
Josie: Sure. Yeah. This is a good time for that.
Rhi: Minx in particular packed a lot of stuff. You are not— Minx. The other two, your stuff might be okay. Minx’s luggage is going to be, like, pulled out, impounded, collect by the Bluecoats, whatever you don’t have on your person—
Josie: Oh no!
Rhi: Is gonna be lost. So, clothes, your bedding…
Josie: Oh dear. Um…
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Why couldn’t it have just been it decouples the car? [laughs]
Rhi: Cause I wanna save that for how this roll goes. [laughs] And decoupling the car could potentially be an advantage to you, because you’re not too far out from Duskwall at this point.
Josie: That is true. Um… eh… this is a surprisingly character-fraught moment.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] Okay. I think the last time there was a choice between luxury and a compatriot I chose wrong, and now Bazso is a thing.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: I think Minx is gonna chose right this time and let the stuff go.
Rhi: I’m very proud of her.
Josie (as Minx): I really liked that bedding.
Rhi: [laughs] She doesn’t know it at this point, but that’s the loss.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. Go ahead and make that roll.
Josie: I did get a 6.
Rhi: Okay. So it was worth it. I think, Minx, you set up the charges on the outside of the door, so in that kind of connecting space. Close the door that Blaire had picked the lock on. When you hear the other door open, you blow the charges and the door that leads back into the rest of the train is basically, kind of like, welded shut.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: So, people can’t get in through that door. They could in theory maybe, like, climb back up around, climb over, but it’s gonna delay them significantly having to go up and over and down to the next entry point and then back down through the train.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, I’m gonna say that this has effectively reset the clock down to 1 out of 6.
Josie: Cool.
Rhi: So, explosion happens. I think there is, like, a pause where you’re all like, “Are we… still… connected to the rest of the train?” But you seem to be continuing onwards, so it’s like, “Okay.”
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, so you’ve still got this electrified cage to deal with.
Josie: Yes. I don’t know how to deal with that part.
Rhi: Blaire, you can give Attuning another shot, you can try Tinkering with, kinda, the security system in here, to see…
Kim: I’m gonna try Tinkering again, because that last roll was bullshit and I have more dice in Attune, as I’ve stated. 2, 2, 1.
Rhi: Oh my God. Was that on Tinker?
Kim: No, that was… no, I only have—
Rhi: That was Attune?
Kim: Yeah, I only have one dice in Tinker.
Rhi: Oh, okay. Okay, that’s what I thought, Okay. Yeah, I think I’m gonna go with you lose this opportunity. You are just not able to, like, figure out how to control the electricity here. It’s just like, I think you’re standing there and you’re concentrating and you come out of it and you’re woozy and you have a little bit of a nosebleed, and it’s just not working. Anybody else wanna take a swing at this?
Josie (as Minx): Myra, how do we get through this?
Minna (as Myra): I can take a crack. Let’s try this.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Minna: I’ve got two in Attune, so that’s actually not a bad idea.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: You’re gonna take harm no matter what.
Minna: Hmm. What level of harm?
Rhi: Level 1.
Minna: Let’s go for it. Really? Fuck you. It’s a 3.
Rhi: Oh no.
Josie: [groans]
Rhi: Um… I think I’m just gonna bump that up to level 2 harm. I think that, like, you’re trying to do the same thing that Blaire was, and you just get zapped. Like, the lightning almost seems to be fighting back against you all now.
Josie: Uh… I mean, does our solution have to be trying to control ghost lightning? I figured we’d just try and disarm this somehow.
Minna: Yeah, if you can figure out another way through. I just, that was my best option, I think.
Rhi: You do have explosives.
Josie: Can I use them again?
Rhi: Yeah, the demolition tools, like, yeah. It’s not just one use of it. I feel like once you say “I have this” you’ve got—
Josie: Okay, yes, because I am out of load. Yeah. Time to explode a hole in this.
Rhi: This is gonna still be risky. You gonna push yourself, Devil’s Bargain?
Josie: Yeah, I’ll push myself. That only leaves me with one stress remaining, but let’s make this happen. 6.
Rhi: [exhales] Okay. I feel like you throw a grenade at it.
Josie: Yep. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] So I think what happens is you throw this grenade and it blows a hole in the cage. And the crate also kinda gets, like, blasted aside. I imagine Blaire is probably the first one in.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: And you, like, rummage into this crate, which fortunately was packed with a lot of, like… I guess it wouldn’t be straw. Soft stuff. Oh, probably like dried seaweed, actually.
Josie: Huh.
Rhi: Would be, like, a cheap packing material. So, you dive into that and you’re digging around, and you find inside this larger wooden crate a very finely-crafted, because it’s Whitehollow, silver box. That surprisingly, after all this, isn’t locked. It just has a simple little latch on it. Are you gonna open it up?
Kim: Yes. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] You open it up and very similar to kind of how the Eye of Kotar was presented, the box is lined with sort of a dusty old velvet. It’s very soft and padded. Inside this box is a, well, it’s a hand. It’s a right hand. It’s more mummified than anything, it’s not a skeleton hand. It’s, like, desiccated and leathery. It stops at the wrist very neatly. And that is it. Sitting in this very nice box.
Kim: Can I touch it?
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah you can.
Josie (as Minx): Disgusting.
Rhi: When you touch it, it twitches.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] Hello!
Josie (as Minx): [gagging noise]
Rhi: And very suddenly, it twists around and, like, latches onto the back of your hand. So it’s like a right hand overlaid on top of your right hand.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Well this is new.
Josie (as Minx): Kill it!
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, no!
Rhi: It feels very, like, it doesn’t look any different, but it feels like if somebody, like a friend, laid their hand on tops of yours. It feels very warm and full of life, and almost comforting.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh…
Rhi: Blaire, it really, it just wants to help you.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww. Okay!
Josie (as Minx): Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Josie (as Minx): Everything fine?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! Yeah, this is cool, check it out!
Josie (as Minx): You sure?
Kim: And Blaire’s gonna just, like, lift her hand up. [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): It wasn’t supposed to move.
Kim (as Blaire): What do you mean? Eyeball Friend moves. This makes sense.
Rhi: You can, I wanna remind you what happened when you used the Eye. You take a lot of stress from using it.
Kim: Yup.
Rhi: You can either give in to what is being offered here, this help, you know, which I imagine is kinda what Blaire wants to do.
Kim: She wants to know what the fuck it does.
Rhi: Blaire can make a resistance roll to hold off on activating this right now at this moment, but she’s gonna have to resist because this is her vice, this is what she wants.
Kim: Yep. I mean…
Rhi: You’re gonna take stress either way. The resistance roll, you will probably take less.
Kim: Yes. I think Blaire is going to recognize that now is not the time or place. She needs to interact with this thing under a controlled environment. So, I’m going to roll to resist.
Rhi: Yeah. That’s going to be Resolve.
Kim: Okay, that is 6, 6, 6, 4, 4. Does that count as a crit?
Rhi: Yeah, so when you crit on a resistance roll, not only do you not take any stress, you actually clear one stress.
Kim: Oh, dope! This is awesome.
Rhi: [laughs] So, you clear one stress.
Kim: I learn something new about this game every time we play.
Rhi: So, I think you are able to gently remove the hand and put it back in the box.
Kim: I give it a pat.
Rhi: Yeah, like, on the knuckles. And it kind of like, after you set it back in there, it settles and goes still again.
Josie (as Minx): Phew.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m gonna name you Handy.
Rhi: [laughs] This ancient, powerful relic, lost for centuries.
Kim: [laughs] Yeah.
Rhi: That Blaire has been, like, just vibrating with excitement about for multiple episodes, has been named Handy.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): As though it is a bloody pet.
Minna: It’s really par for the course.
Rhi: Okay, so you have this thing. I’m gonna make a fortune roll to see how far you are from Duskwall.
Kim (as Blaire): You and Eyeball Friend are gonna get along so well.
Josie (as Minx): We really do not need any mor pets. Hex is enough.
Rhi: So, I think as you’re all standing here, you hear, like, the whistle blow a few times, which basically means we’re approaching the station. The problem is you all are no longer in the passenger area. [laughs] So you’re gonna have to, basically I’ll need, like, ideally one more roll for you all to get somewhere where you can slip off the train without getting caught upon arrival.
Josie: Right. Well, I think perhaps, maybe, we can simply go a car over, and I’m still wearing the conductor uniform, right?
Rhi: [laughs] Yes, but it is covered in blood.
Josie: Ah, right. Yes.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] Yeah. I think we need to just go to the back of the train and slink off into the night.
Rhi: Okay. How about a group Prowl, just to hide? Because there are, like, people looking for you.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: So, who wants to lead that?
Josie: I cannot.
Kim: Okay, I’ll lead it.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Hah hah, that’s a 1, baby.
Minna: Fuck you, it’s a 2.
Rhi: Oh dear. Okay.
Minna: The dice gods hate us.
Josie: Really? [laughs]
Rhi: So the result is a 2. [laughs] So, you all are hustling along towards the back of the train. Blaire’s got the box tucked under her arm. And you kind of hurry across into a cargo car that’s just, sort of, loaded with crates and stuff. And as you all move into the car, a figure very dramatically steps out from behind the crates. And Minx, you recognize this as the person that you saw at breakfast giving orders. This is the person with that tattoo. They step out and I think that they are wearing, like, a very long, dramatic coat.
Josie: Uh huh…
Rhi: And they have, like, their hair is pulled back, but they’ve got some little wispies around that are fluttering dramatically. Minx, even though you are injured and you just wanna get through this situation, you appreciate this person’s commitment to the aesthetic. Like, they’ve got a very, like, solid goth look going on here. And it’s like… they know what they’re about.
Josie (as Minx): Good, good. We are not about to be stopped by someone sloppy.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] They step and I don’t think they say anything. They just raise a hand and a gust of wind basically blasts at all of you.
Josie: Uh… [laughs]
Rhi: And if you want to keep your footing, you will need to make a resistance roll. Otherwise, you’re gonna get knocked backwards and take… this’ll be level 1 harm.
Josie: I can’t risk taking stress from a resistance roll.
Rhi: Okay. So, Minx, you get knocked backwards, slam into a wall. It hurts very badly because you got shot, so you’re gonna take level 1 harm, battered. Blaire? Myra? What are you two doing?
Kim: I can resist. Which resistance am I rolling?
Rhi: Prowess.
Kim: Okay.
Minna: Er… I guess I’m also gonna try and resist.
Kim: Phew, okay. That’s two 6s and a 3.
Rhi: Wow.
Kim: Is that another crit for… oh my God, okay.
Minna: Oh thank God. I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay, so Myra takes no stress, Blaire clears one stress. You two, like, just stand your ground.
Josie: [laughs] And Minx gets blown all the way back, just like:
Josie (as Minx): [shrieks]
Kim: You just get yeeted down the hall.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: So, this person, like, raises an eyebrow.
Rhi (as Tattooed Stranger): Impressive. Mostly. Hand over the box and I don’t have to kill all of you.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t think that’s gonna happen.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, you act like that’s actually an option we’re gonna take.
Kim (as Blaire): Also, how the fuck did you do that?
Rhi (as Tattooed Stranger): Well, if you were a better Whisper, you would know.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, you wanna throw hands, bitch?
Rhi (as Tattooed Stranger): Uh, I would appreciate it if you threw The Hand to me, yes.
Kim (as Blaire): No, I mean do you wanna throw hands? Do you wanna fucking go?
Rhi: I need you to roll resistance, she’s blasting you with lightning.
Kim: Oh fuck! Okay. [laughs] Is it Resolve?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Well, it’s a supernatural effect, so yes.
Kim: Yes, okay. Okay, 5.
Rhi: Okay, so you take one point of stress, and you’re gonna take— it was level 2 harm, but now it’s dropped down to level 1 as you get… you’re a little zapped, a little crispy.
Josie: Yes, this bitch getting shot.
Rhi: Yeah, this is what happens when— I haven’t really had… the way that, like, powerful one-off enemies work is a little weird in this game, so I haven’t really done it much, but I’m trying it out here.
Kim (as Blaire): I have ghosts and I’m not afraid to use them.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: They just smirk.
Josie: I’m taking a shot. Like, I’m crumpled against the back of the car, but I’m lifting up my arm and trying to shoot her.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead and take that shot. It’s gonna be risky, reduced effect.
Josie: A 4.
Rhi: Shit, I’m gonna have to name this person, aren’t I? You’re gonna have a nemesis here if they survive it. 4, okay. You do it but there’s a consequence. You take the shot and, you know, this person twists out of the way a little bit so it just grazes along their arm. And they kind of look at their sleeve, which is now torn, and they kind of make a face. And then are just like:
Rhi (as Tattooed Stranger): I don’t actually have to kill you. I just have to keep you here until The Bluecoats arrive.
Rhi: And you all realize, suddenly, that, “Oh, the train has stopped.” So, starting a new clock for Bluecoats Arrive.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: 1 out of 4.
Josie: Great.
Kim: Oh no!
Rhi: Yeah. So, what are you all gonna do?
Kim: We need to outta here.
Minna: Uh huh.
Josie: Yeah, I mean, bolting might be an option.
Rhi: Yeah, you will have to make a roll to just book it, because this person is not just gonna stand there and let you go.
Minna: I think we should do a group book it. I don’t know what that action is.
Rhi: Prowl, probably.
Minna: Prowl. Do you wanna do group Prowl, y’all?
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, let’s do it.
Minna: I can lead.
Rhi: Alright.
Kim: 1! I’m gonna…
Josie: A 2.
Minna: 6!
Rhi: 6, okay, alright.
Josie: Phew.
Minna: So I take two stress and…
Rhi: Two stress, but you got a 6.
Minna: We do it.
Josie: I imagine that what this looks like is like, Minx is kinda slumped back near the door, Kim is like, “Oh you wanna go? You wanna throw hands?” and Myra’s just like, “Nope. We’re leaving.” [laughs] And grabs us both.
Rhi: So yeah, I think that Myra is able to drag the two of you out the door and you just run. Book it through Gaddoc Station, and once you kind of get out into the station proper, you know, I picture this like Union Station in New York. It’s massive and full of people and you’re able to disappear into the crowd very quickly. And yeah, you [laughs] badly injured, almost everyone at max stress, I think, what, we had two of you at eight?
Josie: Yep.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. So, you make it away and back into surprisingly, the comforting, dark, crowded streets of Duskwall. Okay, so let’s do our downtime scenes. Let’s start with Myra, I think.
Minna: okay.
Rhi: So, what are you up to?
Minna: I feel like this is very public house based.
Rhi: Yeah, so you’re, like, at a local tavern somewhere in Six Towers?
Minna: Yeah. I don’t know if it’s Six Towers or Nightmarket— well, it’d be Six Towers. Because Nightmarket, there’s only one pub for us.
Rhi: Aww. [laughs]
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: You’re working on reducing heat. I feel like it’s just kind of like there’s a few bars in the area that you’ve kind of ingratiated yourself to, like, the regulars and the bartender.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So you’re not a regular, but they regulars all know you.
Minna: I think that I trade little favors that I can do for their favor of going out and spreading the good word, like, good words about us.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, yeah. So, what does that look like?
Minna: I’m trying to think how to phrase this, because I think literacy is decent, but, like, for some more complicated things, or somebody needs me to look over a contract, or just little—
Rhi: Oh yeah, yeah.
Minna: Just little admin things that people can use help with. And I just kinda set up shop in a corner. And we chat while I’m doing it.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. I like that. So yeah, I think that absolutely makes sense. I think that this is a society where a basic level of literacy is helpful to the ruling class.
Minna: Yeah, like I’ve definitely talked about, like, schoolhouses at factories and things like that.
Rhi: Yeah, because you want people… it’s easier for people to maintain the machinery if they can read the labels, but I think like, legal contracts or things like that, people would have more trouble with. I really like that idea. So, Myra just kinda sets up shop at, you know, one of these local pubs in Six Towers and yeah, I think it’s just people come in and bring in some papers and just chat and ask for advice on probably a lot of, like, you’re kind of providing like, “I’m not a lawyer, but…”
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Type advice. And yeah, I think we kind of see that happening. Myra’s having these little conversations and then we see some of these people going out into the city and, like, get stopped The Bluecoats and they’re just like, “The Magpies? I’ve never heard of them, I don’t know,” covering up the Magpie pin on their jacket. [laughs]
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. So I think we just sort of see that, of that ripple effect of a lot of the citizens in the area are doing what they can to turn The Bluecoats off your trail.
Minna: I love Myra working off of favors.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s cool. And I like the favors that she’s providing. That’s a really cool thing. Alright, so while Myra is out winning over the citizenry, what is Minx up to?
Josie: Minx is going to see Nyryx.
Minna: Aww.
Josie: She’s going to get a small bundle of flowers and put the necklace in a little box and…
Rhi: Aww.
Josie: It’s clear that she’s clearly favoring one of her arms over the other. Like, she’s not in a cast or anything, but is sort of like, the other one’s a little bit limp. She’s not moving it all that much.
Rhi: Yeah. Are you meeting Nyryx at her work or at her apartment? Are you going out somewhere?
Josie: I was just thinking at her apartment.
Rhi: Okay. So, yeah, I guess you knock on the door with your good arm and there’s a pause from inside. Like, you know, it goes quiet, then you hear footsteps approaching and the door cracks open. And she’s like,
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh! Minx! Hi! You’re back.
Josie (as Minx): Hi Nyry, yes.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Hi.
Josie (as Minx): Just got off the train. After spending some time in bed, but you know how it is.
Rhi: I think she, like, she goes to give you a hug and you probably wince a little bit.
Josie: Mm hmm. [laughs]
Rhi: She’s not aware that you’re injured. She’s like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh, well you’ll have to tell me all about it. I’ve, I mean, you know, I haven’t ever left Duskwall either.
Josie (as Minx): Of course.
Rhi (as Nyryx): That’s so… [sighs] That’s just so exciting. You actually got to leave for a little bit.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. It was only for about a day, but it’s amazing what difference a day can make. Even on a business trip. I did manage to bring you something back from Whitehollow though.
Josie: And she’ll present her gifts.
Rhi: So yeah, she takes the flowers and sets them in a vase or something, then takes the jewelry box and opens it up very carefully, and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): [gasps] Oh Minx, this is beautiful!
Rhi: Do you wanna describe what it is?
Josie: Yeah, it’s kind of a, it’s a silver necklace. The Silver Spinners Guild, I think it was? So it’s like Whitehollow silver. It’s kind of cut in the shape of lotus, but poking out the top is a small, kind of like a dark amber jewel, kind of forming the center, but in a teardrop shape.
Rhi: Nice. Yeah, so I think she lifts up the pendant and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh Minx, this is beautiful! Thank you so much. Oh, here, here, I wanna see how it looks.
Rhi: And she takes it out and is, like, doing that thing where she’s fumbling with the clasp behind her neck.
Josie: Mm hmm. I will try to help her if she needs it. [laughs] With my one hand.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. I think it’s just the fact that even if you’re doing it one-handed, I think she can, like, hold the one side and then you can get the other hooked in.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: And she gets it settled and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): This is, I love it Minx, thank you. This is… thank you.
Rhi: And she will, like, bounce up on her toes and give you a kiss.
Josie: Yay! [laughs]
Rhi: And I think at this point she’s kind of noticing that you’ve been favoring that one arm, where like you did not use two hands to clasp the necklace and she’s just like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Are you alright? Did you get hurt at all?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, yes. But that is pretty par for the course in our line of work.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Alright, well then sit down at least, and I’ll make you some tea and you can tell me everything about your trip.
Josie (as Minx): I’ve missed your tea.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [laughs] And I’ve missed you.
Rhi: And I think when you sit she, like, gives you another quick kiss and then goes off to make tea.
Josie: Yay! Yeah. And I think it’s just pleasant.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Minna: They’re the cutest.
Rhi: They’re so cute.
Josie: Eee!
Rhi: Yeah, she just had all kinds of questions about being out of the city and what was it like and, yeah.
Josie: Yeah. And Minx is more than happy to go into detail and go on and on about things. And then occasionally mention that:
Josie (as Minx): I lost my favorite bedding. [sniff]
Rhi: Oh. [laughs]
Josie: But it’s half-fake tears. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I think what ended up happening was after a couple days one of you went back to Gaddoc Rail to try to reclaim your luggage. And Blaire and Myra’s luggage was in the, like, you know, lost and found section. But Minx’s, there was like… I think there was a note, of like, “If someone comes asking for luggage under this name, probably alert The Bluecoats.
Josie: Right. [laughs]
Rhi: So it was kinda one of those things where it was like, “Okay, we’re gonna go.” [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Um, so yeah, I think when you mention that, Nyryx is just like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. I mean, hey, if you want, maybe sometime later we can go shopping together and find you something new?
Josie (as Minx): That would be wonderful. Although really, it’s experiences on vacation, right?
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yes, I mean it sounds like some of your experiences were not so good, but…
Josie (as Minx): Well, we all made it back. We went what we did for, and I got to sample some seafood.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [laughs] Well, maybe next time, if it’s a less dangerous trip, I could go with you.
Josie (as Minx): I’d like that.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yeah, I would too.
Rhi: And I think we’ll fade out there.
Josie: Yay, cuteness.
Rhi: They’re so cute, God.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Alright. I think we fade out from that and then fade back in on Blaire. Where do we find Blaire?
Kim: In her room.
Rhi: Yep. [laughs] Yep.
Kim: She’s on the floor. I don’t think she has a desk in her room, she just kinda does all her work on the floor.
Rhi: That makes sense.
Kim: Yeah, she is gonna set that box in front of her and very slowly, reverently, open it up again.
Rhi: It still contains that hand.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi, Handy. Welcome to your new home. One of your siblings is here, but I’m gonna wait a bit until I figure out what you do before I put you two together. Does that sound good?
Rhi: Seeing as it’s a desiccated hand that only seemed to react when you touched it, it does nothing.
Kim: Okay. [laughs]
[laughter]
Kim: Okay, Blaire is going to very slowly put out a hand and very lightly touch it again.
Rhi: Okay. As soon as you make contact, it’s that same thing. It suddenly twitches and then flips around to overlay on top of your hand. And yeah, it just has that very, like, warm, comforting, friendly feeling.
Kim (as Blaire): You’re a good baby.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: There’s still that feeling of, like, wanting to use it. To activate it.
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Rhi: But it’s not as strong as it was there. Because you were in a very, like, high-adrenaline, high-pressure situation.
Kim: Right, right.
Rhi: So, I think you can kinda take some time to examine this and try to figure out what it does. And you aren’t really able to get the specifics of it, but you kind of, you do some testing without fully activating it. It seems to be protective in nature. It has some properties similar to, like, a spiritbane charm.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: But, like, amplified, and it seems like it could possibly protect from more than spirits. You’re not sure. Again, without fully activating it you don’t know exactly what it does, but—
Kim: I wanna activate it so bad.
Rhi: If you activate it, you’re taking the stress hit, but you can get a little—
Kim: Just one?
Rhi: Oh no, it’s way more than one stress. [laughs] Yeah, none of these artifacts come cheap. But they all are very powerful. So…
Kim: I know what I said earlier about Blaire not introducing it to the Eye, but can I just put the two in close vicinity to each other, just to see what happens, as part of this test?
Rhi: Just to clarify, you’re putting them just in close proximity, not touching?
Kim: Yeah. No, they’re not touching.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I wanna see if they interact at all. So, Blaire is gonna reach under her bad and reach for the box that has the Eye of Kotar in it, and take that out.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi, buddy.
Rhi: Okay. Hand is in box, Eye is in box.
Kim: Yep. I’m gonna take Hand out of box and put it on floor, take Eye out of box and put it on the floor and keep them about, maybe, six inches apart.
Rhi: Okay. So, when you put the Hand down it doesn’t do anything. When you put the Eye down next to it, it’s like magnet pulls snapping towards each other. They don’t move closer, but the Hand whips around. It flips over so it’s palm-up and is kind of cupped as if you could place something in the palm.
Kim: Ooh, interesting.
Rhi: And the Eye is, like, locked on, staring at it. And I think, Blaire being Blaire, you kind of look into the ghost field briefly. It’s not, so both of the artifacts are kind of glowing, as they do.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: But between them is, it’s not a line of force, it is like some kind of runes or demonic script. It’s something that, the longer you look at it, the weirder your brain starts to feel.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Like, it’s not a headache, it’s just…
Kim: It’s more like vertigo, maybe?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. It’s kind of a vertigo, twisty, reality feels a little weird right now, sensation.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: But there’s just this line of this script running between the two of them, linking them together.
Kim: Interesting.
Rhi: So, that’s sort of a straight line. And then, coming off the top of them are two more lines, but they only go out a couple inches. But if you were to carry those lines forward, they would form the point of a triangle, to a missing third piece.
Kim: Oh, cool. That’s really cool.
Rhi: So, that is what you see.
Kim: See, I have a theory now that because the Hand went upward, palm up, that the Eye now wants to be— or rather, the Hand wants to hold the Eye. Because it’s in perfect holding position.
Rhi: It is. Yeah.
Kim: I’m gonna do it.
Minna: No…
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: [laughs]
Josie: Oh…
Rhi: So, you put that on there and sort of those lines of script kind of shift so that the Hand holding the Eye is now in the middle of this incomplete triangle. And those other lines of script that are incomplete have extended out a little further.
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: There’s still a gap to where a third thing should go.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: But it’s a little more complete.
Kim: Interesting. But noting catastrophic happened making them touch, which is cool.
Josie: That’s good.
Rhi: Mm hmm. There is a sort of, like, humming feeling, like you get that kinda like vibration in your teeth of like, you get this feeling sometimes when you’re, like, around Setarra when she is unleashing her powers, of you are in the presence of some really, really powerful occult forces.
Kim: Right. Now, what happens if I touch the Eye of Kotar as it sits within the Hand?
Rhi: It doesn’t really seem to react to you. The Eye is kind of, the Eye is now focused sort of looking towards that empty point.
Kim: So cool. Okay, I’m gonna take them apart. I’m sorry guys, to drag this one, but I’m having so much fun.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Kim: God, I wanna use it so fucking bad. I wanna know what it does.
Rhi: [laughs] Well, you know. Just start bringing it with you when you go out on scores.
Kim: Is that a hint?
Rhi: The protective elements will be of best use to you on a score. I’ll say that.
Kim: Okay. So I’ll just activate it during a score and see what happens.
Rhi: Yeah, just, you know, start carrying a hand around in your bag. It’s fine.
Kim: Makes sense. Okay, so I’m gonna have to figure out a way to carry this around.
Rhi: The box is small enough you can kinda tuck it into your satchel with your other stuff.
Kim: Oh, I was gonna put in, like, a drawstring pouch.
Rhi: That also works.
Kim: Yeah. Yeah, Blaire puts it in a pouch and she’s gonna tie that pouch to her belt. For easy access.
Rhi: And I think as you do that, you get that settled on your belt, and then I think you here, like, Myra calling from downstairs that dinner’s ready, and you head off downstairs.
Kim: [laughs] God.
Rhi: With this ancient, powerful relic tied to your belt.
Kim: That’s… Blaire’s a bit too much like me, because she just goes to her room, does her own weird shit and only leaves for meals, when her mom calls her downstairs.
[laughter]
Rhi: We fade in on a well-appointed meeting room. It is a testament to the wealth that went into furnishing it. The walls are polished wood, the floors are covered in thick, hand-woven Iruvian rugs, and familiar abstract paintings hang in gilded frames. Dominating the room is a beautifully-crafted oval shaped wooden table. The style is old, pre-cataclysmic, making the table more valuable than the building in which it sits. It is surrounded by chairs that have been carved in a matching style, though they were made far more recently. Seated in these chairs are three individuals. Of the remaining four empty chairs, two have been turned to face away from the table.
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): Thank you both for coming on such short notice. I’m afraid I do not come with good news.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): It’s always wretched news these days. Those damned coal fuckers burned down another construction site and—
Rhi (as Lady Drake): We have more important matters to discuss than your factories, Alistair.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): Now look here—
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): Drake is right. We need to focus.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): Aren’t we short a member?
Rhi (as Lady Drake): We’re short several.
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): She won’t be joining us tonight. She’s wrapped up with the management of the establishment. I have informed her of the situation and she has shared her opinion.
Rhi: Lady Penderyn holds up a sealed letter and places on the table in front of her.
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): I hate to bring The Circle more dire news, especially in the wake of Raffello’s death, but I’m afraid that the Hand has been lost.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Of bloody course it has.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): What? How did you fucking lose it?
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): It was compromised on the train from Whitehollow. Stroman sold us out.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): To who?
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): Who do you think?
Rhi (as Lady Drake): I told you they were good.
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): You also told us they refused to cooperate in the slightest. Recruitment is out of the question.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Give me some more time.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): More time? So they can get their hands on the heart? Loot our vaults? Kill the rest of you?
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): He’s right. We don’t have time. The Magpies have to be destroyed. Quite frankly, it’s an embarrassment we haven’t done so already.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): As I said, they’re good. And well connected. Ruthless enough to thin our numbers considerably. If the plan is to defeat them rather than recruit them, we need to bolster our position. Our weakness has become their strength.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): If we can find their hideout, I can take care of them easily.
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): Despite our continued appeals to The Fallen Star, the location of their lair remains hidden from us.
Rhi: Lady Drake and Lord Mora share a look and roll their eyes.
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): I agree we need to locate their hideout, but that is not our only option. We are aware of several people and places with ties to The Magpies, thanks in no small part to the work of our information broker.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): Who failed to kill them when she had them in the palm of her hand.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): For what it’s worth, you haven’t had any better luck.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): [grunts]
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): Salia was unable to meet our demands previously, but circumstances have changed. Our numbers are reduced. The Umbra Hunters are not adapting well to new management, and I suspect that soon we will need to cut them loose entirely. Our people and funds are stretched thin. And while she cannot offer us The Magpies, she has a new approach that could prove useful in hunting them.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Which is?
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): One of her lackeys was severely injured in a confrontation with The Magpies last month. The lackey’s soul has since been… repurposed. If her methods have worked, we may also be able to find a new use for our fallen members.
Rhi: She gestures at the chairs that have been turned away from the table.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): So, you want her to join us?
Rhi (as Lady Drake): It makes sense. She has information, contacts, connections, all the reasons I advocated for her membership before. Whatever new arcane powers she’s boasting are bonuses.
Rhi: Penderyn slides the letter across the table to Mora. He makes a face and opens it, then reads quietly.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): Well. It appears I am out-voted. Three to one. Hmph. I think I preferred this organization when there were people involved who actually listened to me.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): Don’t be petulant, Alistair.
Rhi: Mora pushes back from the table.
Tracey (as Lord Mora): Do as you will. I need to see to my own affairs.
Rhi: He storms out. Drake and Penderyn exchange a look.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): He’s starting to be more trouble than he’s worth.
Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): We’ve lost too many. He stays.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): As you wish, Lady Penderyn. Was there anything else?
P Hazel (as Lady Penderyn): Not at the moment. We shall reconvene in a few days to welcome our newest member.
Rhi (as Lady Drake): I look forward to it.

##Blooper [1.33.59]
Rhi: Alright.
Kim: [sings] I’ve got a wyrm on a string, sitting on a rainbow…
Minna: See, that’s what my brain was doing.

Minna: You realize this is recorded.

"Season 3, Episode 7: The Masked Allies Score Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us.
We got some really lovely, kind reviews in December and they absolutely brightened our holiday season. If you haven’t left a review yet, please consider doing so. Reviews make us really happy and they help new people find the show, which also makes us happy.
You can continue to support us in the usual places by backing us on Patreon, where you can get all kinds of cool behind the scenes and secret archive content including the magpies Quill blog which features posts like Minx’s Fashion Folio, Blaire’s Guide to the Deathlands, and Myra’s Historical Research. This month I think Minna is writing a Sherlock Holmes AU set in Duskwall, which is just awesome, I can’t wait to see it. You can get all that content and so much more for just $2 per month.
If you can’t commit to a monthly payment, you can also buy a Magpies pin from our Shapeways store. All profits from the store go to our charity of the month.
Before I get into the other announcements I do have a content warning for this episode. This episode includes the off-screen death of a teenager and the on-screen attendance at the funeral for that teenager. If you need you, you can safely skip over that section without missing the main plot of the episode. The specific timestamps are in the show notes.
{Transcriber’s Note: Discussion of death begins at 11:15; funeral begins at 15:35 and ends at 24:00. The transcript contains markers at these times.}
Now, those other announcements.
First, in case you missed it last episode, I’m working on launching a second podcast. It’s called Aid Another, and it’s an advice show for RPG characters. People will write in-character letters as their PCs or NPCs asking for advice on a problem that their character is facing, then each episode a guest host and I will answer a few of those letters. I’ve gotten a number of letters already and I’m really excited to start recording this week, but I need more letters to keep recording. I’d especially love to get some from Blades in the Dark games. If you’re interested, check out the show notes for a link to the submission guidelines.
I was also a guest GM on She’s a Super Geek for their episodes of Descent into Midnight which are airing this month. Descent into Midnight is a game in which players are aquatic creatures on an alien world where psionics and bioengineering define society. The game is about community and corruption and friendship, and the stories always end up being incredibly creative and emotional. I was asked to GM the game because I’m the accessibility consultant for the published version which is going to be on Kickstarter next month. You’ll be hearing me talk a lot about Descent into Midnight when the Kickstarter launches, but if you’re interested in learning more now, go check out the first part of the series by following the link in the show notes.
Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charities.
Josie: Hi Magpies lovelies. Two things for Featured Charity this time. Obviously, the Australian wildfires are insane, there’s tons of charities for those… donate to that, that’s top priority right now. There’s so many people without their homes. But also, I just wanted to plug individual trans fundraisers again, because I am not super happy with most trans charities right now. So, please check in with your trans friends, find trans people to follow, send them money, look out for their fundraisers. So many of my trans friends are still in poverty and not seeing jack of shit from most charity organizations. So, #TransCrowdFund, anything like that. Whenever I see a trans person with a fundraiser up I try and retweet it, so follow me on Twitter if you need help finding stuff. Yeah, that’s my push for Featured Charity this month. Thanks.
Rhi: 2020 has not gotten off to a great start around the world. There is the looming threat of yet another war, climate change fueled disasters, to say nothing of the ongoing humanitarian crises in the United States and elsewhere. Compassion fatigue is a real thing. It is exhausting to be bombarded with so much terrible in the world and to hear the calls for everyone to step up and fix everything. It’s overwhelming, and sometimes it can be disempowering, because no one person can fix everything. So, if it’s getting to be too much it’s okay to narrow your focus for a bit.
Find a few things to focus your energy or your money on, for the week or for the month. Burn out and despair don’t help anyone. We’ve got a long, hard fight ahead of us on a lot of fronts. It’s okay to give yourself a break when you need it, just don’t give up.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:05:41]
Rhi: A handful of days after The Magpies have returned from their brief trip outside of Duskwall to the city of Whitehollow we find them, still I think a bit battered and bruised after their successful, narrowly successful, train heist to recover the Hand of Kotar, back at The Hound’s Paw. I think that it is mid-afternoon, so it’s kind of a slow period between the folks who come in around lunch time and then the evening crowd, so not a lot of people there. That means Rigney is free to have been basically, politely pepper you with questions about Whitehollow. Like a lot of people in Duskwall he’s never left the city, so he was very curious about your trip. I’ll leave it up to all of you how many details you gave him about the less pleasant parts of your adventure.
Josie: [chuckling] Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But I think as you all are wrapping up whatever version of the story you’re telling him he comes over with a fresh round of drinks for all of you and tucks his tray under his arm.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, it sounds like you all had quite a time. I hope it was worth all the trouble.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, it was quite a ride, as they say.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): But it was definitely worth the trouble.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, I know you weren’t gone too long, but you missed a bit of excitement around here. I mean, I don’t know, some of this you might have heard already. I haven’t seen you for a bit, so I haven’t been able to fill you in on all the gossip.
Josie (as Minx): [smiling] Did someone say gossip?
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Rigney, you should know by now you shouldn’t say the G word around Minx.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, let’s see. I had some visitors from the Inspectors asking about you. They’re much politer than the Bluecoats.
Rhi: He kind of gestures to the untrashed state of his bar.
Kim: Aw.
Rhi (as Rigney): There was one guy with them, I think that one you’ve maybe worked with before, Severin?
Josie (as Minx): Oh!
Rhi (as Rigney): They weren’t as thorough in questioning as they normally were. He seemed to be kind of trying to steer them off your scent, so…
Kim (as Blaire): Well that’s good.
Josie (as Minx): That’s very courteous.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh. Something went down just a couple days ago, I think not long after you left, with the Dimmer Sisters.
Kim (as Blaire): What, really?
Josie (as Minx): Oh?
Rhi (as Rigney): Somebody sent assassins after them?
Minna (as Myra): What?!
Josie (as Minx): Oh!
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah. Well, I mean, it didn’t work.
Minna (as Myra): Did they die?
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, the assassins did.
Minna (as Myra): Yup, that’s about what you’d expect.
Rhi (as Rigney): Everybody found out about the assassination when the bodies were found hanging outside the fence.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear.
Rhi (as Rigney): Apparently already drained of their spirits, so…
Kim (as Blaire): God, that’s vicious.
Rhi (as Rigney): Pretty nasty, nasty piece of work. Let’s see, what else…
Rhi: He drums his fingers on his tray as he’s thinking.
Rhi (as Rigney): Oh, uh, you heard much about what’s going on in The Docks?
Minna (as Myra): No?
Josie (as Minx): Not anything besides a small kerfuffle.
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, the Lampblacks haven’t been holding their territory too well, lost a lot of people recently, and rumor is that the guy in charge is thinking about just pulling out entirely, out of The Docks.
Josie (as Minx): That’s bad.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah. There’s… well, he might not have a choice. There’s also some rumors going around that some of the Lampblacks aren’t too happy with his leadership, that he hasn’t, you know… A lot of people have died, him trying to expand out that far, and there’s rumors floating around about a coup.
Josie (as Minx): Heavens.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): And it seemed that it was on the up for them once they moved in.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, well, whoever else is trying to get control of that territory seems to be pushing back pretty hard.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Rigney): Hmm…
Rhi: He looks thoughtful.
Rhi (as Rigney): That’s kinda the big stuff that I know about. I don’t know. Otherwise things have been business as usual. A bit quieter without you all coming around all the time.
Josie: [chuckles]
Rhi: He smiles at you and winks.
Josie (as Minx): But that is good to hear, Rigney.
Rhi: At this point the door to the bar opens, and Briggs comes in with Mallory, his guide dog.
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: Briggs is one of—old friend of Minx from her misspent youth.
Josie: Yes. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. He works—He runs a stall in the Charhollow Market. He’s an information broker. He kinda steps inside and pauses.
Rhi (as Briggs): This The Hound’s Paw?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah!
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Hello, Briggs.
Rhi (as Briggs): Oh! Heh, good.
Josie (as Minx): [chuckles]
Rhi (as Briggs): And I made it here at a good time.
Rhi: I think Rigney will go over and offer him his arm and walk him over to your table and get him a chair. He thanks Rigney and then is like:
Rhi (as Briggs): I heard that you all had left town for a bit. Glad to hear it wasn’t permanent.
Josie (as Minx): Just a brief holiday.
Kim (as Blaire): Had to take care of some business outside of town, that’s all.

Rhi (as Briggs): Huh.
Rhi: He kind of frowns. It looks like he’s sort of struggling for words.
Josie (as Minx): Is something the matter?
Rhi (as Briggs): Uh, yes, I’m afraid this isn’t a very happy social call. You all remember a girl named Teagan?
Minna (as Myra): Yes?
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi (as Briggs): [sighs] Well, um…
Rhi: Briggs kind of pauses again.
Rhi (as Briggs): I’m afraid I’ve been sent to ask if you would, um, well, come to her funeral.
Minna (as Myra): [disbelieving] What?
Josie (as Minx): [confused] What?
Kim (as Blaire): [sadly] What happened?
Rhi: Rigney doesn’t know who this girl is, and he also looks kind of shocked and sad. Briggs just shakes his head.
Rhi (as Briggs): She, ugh… She got picked up by the Bluecoats for questioning. They held her until her fathers paid the bribe, but that pretty much wiped out the money they had. She lost her job, because she got arrested, and… she went back to that fucking clinic.
Minna (as Myra): [heavy sigh]
Josie (as Minx): Heavens.
Minna (as Myra): We’re going after Hagen. He can’t keep doing this.
Kim (as Blaire): No, hang on… It wasn’t because of us, was it? She wasn’t pulled into questioning because of us?!
Rhi: He doesn’t say anything. He just looks down.
Minna (as Myra): We’re going after Hagen.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): We can’t let this stand.
Kim (as Blaire): [tearful] Do you know? Do you know…?
Rhi (as Briggs): The Bluecoats were asking around a lot of places where people are friendly to you. I don’t know for sure what they asked her, but they’ve been looking for you.
Kim (as Blaire): And they… they went after Teagan.
Rhi: Briggs just again kind of looks down.
Kim (as Blaire): [weakly] This is our fault, guys.
Rhi (as Briggs): No. No. It is not your fault—
Kim (as Blaire): The Bluecoats wouldn’t have pulled her into questioning if she hadn’t been helping us!
Minna (as Myra): She would have gone back to Hagen sooner if we hadn’t been helping her. There was very little we could have done to stop this, except… I don’t know.
Rhi (as Briggs): You either take down the Bluecoats, which, well, that would be nice, but it might be a tall order for the three of you, or…
Rhi: He gestures towards Myra.
Rhi (as Briggs): …like she said, you get rid of that clinic.
Minna (as Myra): We should have done it sooner. We’ve left it standing for too long. We should have burned it down when we had the chance.
Josie (as Minx): [hesitantly] I agree, but… I would never have thought to have heard that suggestion from you, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): What that man does there is evil. He prays on the poor of the city for his own experimentation to help the rich who can afford the medicines he makes. He makes them sick just to find out how to make them better.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, it is—
Minna (as Myra): People go to him over and over and over again and sacrifice their health because they don’t have anything better.
Josie: Minx is kind of leaning back in her chair a bit, her eyes wide, because it’s like wait, this is Myra being passionately and outspokenly angry about something? [laughs]
Minna: Hagen’s clinic is what radicalized Myra. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Second season. I don’t know, I think Season 1?
Rhi: Yeah, that was Season 1, that was a Season 1 thing, yeah. I think Briggs just nods.
Rhi (as Briggs): Well, whatever you end up doing the bastard that runs that place has gotta go.
Kim (as Blaire): [softly] Rigney, can we get a round of wine for the table?
Rhi: He just nods, and yeah, goes and gets drinks for you. I think as he comes back over Briggs says:
Rhi (as Briggs): The funeral’s tomorrow afternoon.
Rhi: He’ll give you an address in Charhollow.
Minna: Oh God, they’re gonna have to face her dads.
Rhi: Yep. Rigney comes over and hands out the drinks.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you, Rigney.
Josie (as Minx): And thank you, Briggs.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi (as Briggs): Yeah…
Josie (as Minx): We’ll be there.
Kim (as Blaire): We will.
Rhi (as Briggs): Thanks.
Rhi: He’ll… He’s not gonna down his whole glass, but he’ll take a sip of his wine and then set it down and head out. I think Rigney will, again, kind of walk him out to the door and give him a little bit of directions, head this way to get back towards Charhollow.
Kim (as Blaire): She was just a kid.
Minna (as Myra): She was so young. She should not have carried that on her shoulders.
Josie (as Minx): She knew she could come to us.
Kim (as Blaire): We were out of town, so we couldn’t bail her… Fuck!
## Content Warning: Funeral [0:15:35] Browse to next tag to skip this content.
Josie (as Minx): I need to go purchase a mourning dress. Would anyone like to come with me?
Kim (as Blaire): No thanks. I have a tux.
Josie (as Minx): Very well. I’ll be back later.
Rhi: So yeah, I think we’ll fade in on a back lot behind a rundown apartment building. I’ve been thinking about this a little bit in terms of what funerals are like in this setting. The thing is, I think there’s the, you know, state church, the Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh. The whole message of that church is not great if you’re poor.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: If you think about, you know, a lot of real world religions, a big part of the beliefs is that there is an afterlife, there is something, usually good, awaiting you after death. This world does not have that at all. Everyone knows what happens when you die, and it’s pretty terrible, so the religion says that this life that you have is the best part of your existence, make the most of it, which if you are living in poverty, if you are hungry, if you are sick, if you are desperate, that’s not a great message, that doesn’t resonate, that doesn’t provide a lot of hope or comfort.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So I don’t think that this ceremony has any kind of connection to, at least, the Church of Ecstasy. I kinda wanted to see if any of you had thoughts about how this might look.
Josie: I feel like cremation needs to be a thing.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Because it’s not like Duskwall has a whole lot of space for catacombs or cemeteries or anything.
Rhi: You have to cremate the body to get rid of the spirit.
Josie: Oh, gotcha.
Minna: I think specifically the Spirit Wardens have to melt you down, basically.
Rhi: Typically, whenever someone dies, the Spirit Wardens collect the body, take it to Bellweather Crematorium, cremate it in a specific way so the spirit is destroyed, and then probably I would presume return the ashes for the burial, for the funeral.
Minna: I wonder if maybe the memorial isn’t at all about the body so much as it’s about remembering the life.
Rhi: Yeah, I think that’s very much what it would be. Yeah. I think it’s more of a, like… I wonder if it’s something where it’s like instead of there being prayers or things like that it’s people taking turns sharing memories of the person.
Kim: I feel like that’s what {they} would do at least.
Minna: Yeah, more of a memorial than an internment.
Rhi: Yeah. Trying to focus on the life that the person had rather than anything else. It’s actually a fairly… there’s a decent number of people gathered in this back lot area. It looks like a lot of people from the neighborhood. Briggs is there with some folks that, Minx, you recognize as working with him. There’s a group of people that look like they’re about Teagan’s age that are all clustered together.
Minna: [whines]
Rhi: Guessing that they’re some of her friends. There’s a group of people that are around two men that are sitting beside each other, holding hands, just looking gutted.
Minna: [sobs]
Josie: [groans]
Rhi: And, I think that, yeah, as you’re there different people will take turns sharing memories of Teagan. There’s a lot of crying. There’s some laughing, you know, there’s some stories that are sillier ones about goofy stuff she got up to when she was a kid. But, it’s a very somber, bleak affair, and I think it’s probably an hour or so and then people start to disperse. I think that there probably is the usual post-funeral meal that’s offered inside. I don’t think that it’s her fathers that are hosting it, I think somebody else in the building has opened up their home for that. I don’t know if you all stick around for that.
Kim: I’d like to talk to her fathers.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: All right! [nervous chuckle]
Minna: I’m sorry. [giggles]
Rhi: No, that’s okay, that’s okay.
Kim: If it’s too much for you we can…
Rhi: I’m good. I’m good with… I feel like I’m good with it. If I start to not be we’ll just pull the plug on it. So yeah, I think a lot of people want to talk to her fathers, so it’s kind of that waiting in line thing to offer your sympathies. They’re sitting off to one side of the gathering where everyone else is getting food and talking quietly. The three of you come up. Her dads don’t look… They have that look where they’re not actually that old, like they’re probably in their late 30s, but they’ve just had very hard lives and it shows. Lines on their faces. One of her fathers has a handkerchief that he keeps coughing into a lot. You know, it’s clear that things have never been very easy for them.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: They look up at the three of you as you approach and clearly do not have any idea who you are. [laughs]
Josie: Minx actually kind of hangs back a little bit.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): We were friends of your daughter’s. My name is Blaire.
Minna (as Myra): I’m Myra.
Josie (as Minx): Minx.
Rhi (as father): Uh… It’s nice to meet you.
Rhi: The one’s who’s been talking more, the one who isn’t coughing, says:
Rhi (as father): I’m Stev. This is my husband, Brance. Good to meet you, although I wish we’d been able to meet sooner. It might have been better circumstances.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re so sorry for what happened.
Rhi (as Stev): Thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): This is a blend of tea that I gave Teagan last time that I saw her.
Kim: Blaire hands out a little pouch for them to take.
Rhi: I think Brance will take it.
Rhi (as Brance): She made some of this for us. It helped a bit. Thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): [tearful] You’re welcome.
Minna: I think Myra also gives them the equivalent of a coin.
Rhi: I think when- I imagine- Like, you’re holding out a little pouch or something?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: I think Stev will reach out to take it, and when he realizes that you’re handing him money he kind of freezes.
Rhi (as Stev): What is this?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know if she’s told you, but we’ve been… helping? I know it’s not going to change what happened, but perhaps it can help ease things for a little bit.
Rhi: I think when you say we’ve been helping he kind of squints at you a little bit.
Rhi (as Stev): The magpies.
Minna (as Myra): [chuckles] I didn’t know she told you.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s us.
Rhi (as Stev): Yeah, she talked about you. Talked about you, well, not a lot, but when she did it was always very positive. She thought very highly of you.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re so sorry.
Rhi (as Stev): You helped her a great deal, and helped us too, and we appreciate it very much.
Rhi: He still seems a little uncomfortable about taking the money, but it’s kind of that, like, he needs it. So yeah, he’ll take it and thank you again and slip it into a pocket.
Minna (as Myra): This was a tragedy. I’m sorry we weren’t able to stop it.
Rhi (as Stev): It wasn’t your responsibility to stop it. It’s… [sighs] it’s how life goes here sometimes.
Kim (as Blaire): It shouldn’t have to.
Rhi: He just kinda shrugs a sort of “yeah, it probably shouldn’t, but what are you gonna do about it.”
## End of Content Warnings [0:24:00]
Minna (as Myra): This is a strange question.
Rhi (as Stev): Mm-hmm?
Minna (as Myra): What was her last name? She never said. {Teagan’s}
Rhi (as Stev): Welker. Our family name is Welker.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi (as Stev): Thank you, for coming. We appreciate it.
Minna (as Myra): Of course.
Rhi: You all move on and the next set of people to give their condolences come up. Unless there’s anything else you all wanna do in this scene or in this neighborhood, I think we can probably cut back to The Nest.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I’m guessing that evening it’s probably still pretty quiet in there.
Josie (as Minx): So we’re burning it down, yes?
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Perhaps not burning it down so much as ridding it of a pest.
Josie (as Minx): How do we intend to do that?
Kim (as Blaire): We can’t forget that Hagen’s powerful. As much as I’m for this, we have to be careful.
Minna (as Myra): I think we have to set something up in advance to make the transition as easy as possible.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Josie (as Minx): Transition to whom?
Minna (as Myra): That’s the question, isn’t it.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s not like we know too many rich assholes who’d be willing to buy a clinic.
Josie (as Minx): And that is just the issue, it cannot be another rich asshole.
Kim (as Blaire): What kind of person with money actually is a good person in this city?
Minna (as Myra): That’s the question, isn’t it? Heh.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Feels like finding a needle in a pile of bones.
Josie (as Minx): Why does it seem like all we ever do these days is try and mitigate the consequences to people we care about, or throw people in the way?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know, but I…
Minna (as Myra): We’re starting to make a difference, which means people are starting to fight back.
Josie (as Minx): Are we? Are we?! I don’t know about that.
Kim (as Blaire): People are still getting hurt.
Minna (as Myra): You’re right. We’re starting to make a name for ourselves, which isn’t the same as making a difference.
Josie (as Minx): It’s funny, when we somewhat gave up on making a name for ourselves that’s when it comes to us, and we decide to make a difference and that goal seems farther and farther away.
Minna (as Myra): We’re scaring them. We have to do more than that.
Kim (as Blaire): So what do we do to actually change things?
Josie (as Minx): And how do we do it without putting more of the people we love in the way?
Minna (as Myra): We need to find somebody who has the power to change this one thing, because we don’t have that yet.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s precisely the problem. Don’t you get it, Myra? Nobody else in power wants to change. So who do we know that actually has deep pockets and is not as big of an asshole as everybody else?
Josie (as Minx): We know…
Josie: Fuck. What’s that contact’s name of mine? I think. The guy with the tea.
Rhi: Um… Amancio!
Josie: Amancio.
Minna: The deal broker?
Rhi: Amancio, um, is…
Josie: Isn’t he tapped out? [laughs]
Rhi: Uh, it’s been a while.
Kim: it’s been a long time.
Rhi: He was tapped out for a while, but I think he would be able to work with you again at this point. Just to sort of clarify for the listeners, I’m guessing that the plan at this point is that you want to find somebody wealthy to take over the clinic and run it actually as a helpful place as opposed to creepy experiments.
Kim: Right.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, Amancio does not have that kind of money, but Amancio does have connections to the upper echelons of society. I will say in terms of other connections that you might have as a group or as individuals, Minx, your work with The Weeping Lady, that’s kind of the charity that operates in the city.
Josie: Yeah…
Rhi: You could see if they know of anybody who makes large, generous donations.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Blaire, you could try your hand with the Reconciled. A lot of them have connections also in high society.
Kim: What about Aranna the Blessed? Do you think… She’s been tapped out for a long time, but do you think she has any high ties?
Rhi: I don’t think we ever really developed her too much…
Kim: No.
Rhi: …so you could try. I think that would kind of be like seeing how that Gather Info roll went, to see what you were able to learn, to see if she has any connections.
Kim: Okay. I’d be willing to roll for her with that.
Rhi: Okay. You don’t have a lot of direct connections to high society, but you do have some more indirect means of trying to feel that out.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: It’s just a lot of those are threads that you either have not ever really tugged on for this purpose or you haven’t gone to for a while. So, who wants to start with their fanning out and talking to people to try to find the one kinda decent person with money in this city? [laughs]
Kim: I’m willing to take a shot.
Rhi: Cool. Yeah. Go ahead and I think make your roll first, because that’ll kind of determine the tenor of the conversation.
Kim: I imagine Consort.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Double 1s! I knew I should have blessed my dice.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Wait. If you only have 1 in Consort, why did you roll two?
Kim: Extra +1 dice for Gather Info.
Rhi: Oh! You’re correct! [laughs]
Kim: [shouting excitedly] I remembered a rule!
Rhi: You did~!
Josie: You did!
Rhi: You remembered a whole ass rule that I forgot. [laughs]
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Yeah. I think you go and try to talk to Aranna, but she just doesn’t operate in those circles at all.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: She tends to work more on the fringes of society with those sort of folks, you know, people kind of more in your position. She does seem glad to see you, though. She hasn’t seen you for a while.
Kim: Yeah, because it’s… Well, she was tapped for a long, long time.
Rhi: Yes. Yeah. But you know, she’s glad that you’re not, you didn’t get dead, she was a little worried.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: That tends to happen to people in this sort of, you know, line of work. They get possessed by a ghost or they summon a demon and get their throat ripped out.
Kim (as Blaire): [giggles suspiciously] I wouldn’t know anything about that!
Rhi: [cackles]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): What are you talking about?
Rhi (as Aranna): Oh! If you’d like to learn more about demons I have some very interesting books.
Kim (as Blaire): I would love some, because I could use some more reading material on that.
[giggling]
Rhi: Yeah, so Blaire, you don’t learn anything helpful about finding someone to sponsor a reformed clinic, but you do get a few interesting tomes on how demons work.
Kim: Yay~! [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yay, demons. [laughs]
Kim: Everything’s fine.
Rhi: Yeah… Who wants to go next?
Josie: I might as well go next.
Rhi: All right. I think again, just go ahead and make your roll first and then we’ll figure out how it goes.
Josie: I’m doing a Consort on this one.
Rhi: Yeah, I feel like these are probably all gonna be Consort.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay! I imagine that you go to the soup kitchen that you usually volunteer at.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: I imagine that you kind of have more regular shifts that you work, you sign up to work at a certain time, and this is not your usual time so I think the woman in charge is like:
Rhi (as woman): Oh!
Rhi: Do you go by Minx or Ellie there?
Josie: I think I go by Ellie there.
Rhi: Okay.
Rhi (as woman): Oh! Ellie. It’s good to see you. I don’t think we have you on the schedule for today.
Josie (as Minx): Oh. Yeah. I wasn’t coming in for a shift, although, I mean, if you need help… I was actually hoping to talk to you about some higher up stuff.
Rhi (as woman): Oh, um, certainly.
Rhi: She’ll usher you back into her very small, cramped office. She has to clear some papers and stuff off a chair. I think her name is… Have I named anybody Helena yet?
Josie: I don’t think so.
Rhi: I don’t think so either. So yes, her name is Helena. She’s kind of in charge of this soup kitchen branch of The Weeping Lady. She’ll clear some stuff off a chair so you can sit and then she’ll sit behind her desk.
Rhi (as Helena): What can I help you with?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah… Okay, so there’s this clinic, and they’re not as good and on the up and up as you all are here.
Rhi (as Helena): Hagen?
Josie (as Minx): Yep, Hagen, that’s the one.
Rhi: She makes a face like she just bit into a lemon.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: You all don’t have lemons, but it’s that face. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] Right.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, my thoughts exactly. I’m looking for someone who’s not Hagen to run that place, and you know, hopefully make things different. I’ll admit I don’t know exactly where our funding comes from, precisely, but if there’s someone like that…
Rhi: There’s sort of a long pause. She’s doing that thing where she’s staring through you, kind of thinking, and then she says:
Rhi (as Helena): I am not going to ask how you plan on making the clinic available for someone else to control.
Josie (as Minx): That’s probably smart.
Rhi (as Helena): But I can tell you we don’t have many benefactors in the sort of upper echelons of society, so the ones who do help us their names tend to stick out. One family that has been pretty consistent in their donations, and fairly generous, are the Evermars.
Josie (as Minx): Evermar.
Josie: Do I know anything off-hand about them?
Rhi: Um… Hmm. Let me think. Yeah, because you do sort of move around in high society a lot… Like most of the wealthy families in the city they make their money through their leviathan hunter ships, like most of the nobility really. If you have leviathan hunter ships you basically get to be nobility in Duskwall.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I think what you know is kind of more what you can infer from their absence. They tend not to go to the sort of events and parties that you do. They’re a little more, not reclusive, but just… their social events are not as frequent and not as loud. [chuckles] Their parties tend to be a little bit more restrained. You do know that the kind of people running the house, Lady Varena Evermar and her spouse, Liege Greer. They’re a little bit older, they’re like in their 30s, so older than the younger nobility that you tend to run around with. They’ve got a couple of children. They’re just sort of at a different stage in their life than the young nobles that you tend to hang out with, Minx, and pump for information.
Josie: Right.
Rhi (as Helena): Yeah, the Evermar family has been very supportive of us. I don’t know if taking over an entire clinic is something that they would be interested in, but I think if you’re going to find anyone who stands a chance of being interested they would be a good place to start.
Josie (as Minx): Right, and they could do it if they wanted.
Rhi (as Helena): I think so, probably.
Josie (as Minx): Okay, that’s good.
Rhi (as Helena): I don’t know the ins and outs of their financial state, but I believe that it would be possible. Quite frankly, even if it results in a reduction in their donations to us, having that man out of the picture and away from the people that we’re trying to help would be more than worth it.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm. It would let us treat the disease and not the symptoms.
Rhi (as Helena): That would be a great improvement, yes.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you, Helena. Actually, is it all right if I stay and help for a couple hours? I’m feeling like I need to do it.
Rhi (as Helena): [laughs] I think we can find a spot for you.
Rhi: She’ll walk you up and get you an apron and find you a place where you can help out.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Probably puts you on dish duty to start with.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Okay! Myra. We can say that this happens after Minx comes back and reports in on what she learned so that you can ask specific questions about this family to Amancio.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So go ahead and make your roll.
Minna: Five.
Rhi: Yeah. You head up into—Where did we say Amancio lived? I think in Charterhall. To his townhome in Charterhall. Yeah, you’re let in and escorted into the parlor as usual. You have to wait there for a couple minutes before you hear, not running footsteps, but speed walking footsteps down the hallway and then the doors fling open.
Rhi (as Amancio): Myra! Oh, where are the rest of you? I thought there would be more. I thought you would all be here. It has been so long since I’ve seen you!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: He rushes over and takes your hands.
Minna (as Myra): [smiling] Just me today. I’m sorry to disappoint you.
Rhi (as Amancio): Oh! Never a disappointment. Are you well? Are you all right? It’s been quite a while.
Minna (as Myra): We’re very well, thank you. It’s just been busy.
Rhi (as Amancio): I completely understand. Please, please, have a seat.
Minna (as Myra): Of course.
Rhi (as Amancio): Tell me, what can I do for you?
Minna (as Myra): [giggling] If you’ll give me a moment to speak, of course.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): We actually had some questions about a noble family here in the city.
Rhi (as Amancio): Mm-hmm?
Minna (as Myra): We would like to find a way to meet with them, the Evermars? Lady Varena and Liege Greer?
Rhi (as Amancio): Oh, yes, yes. Uh, Evermars… I haven’t done a lot of business with them directly myself, but… Oh! [snaps]
Rhi: Without actually explaining himself he vaults to his feet and runs out of the room again.
Minna: I love him. [laughs]
Rhi: And then comes back. [laughs] And is flipping through a notebook.
Rhi (as Amancio): Ah! Yes, yes-yes-yes, I had heard about this. They are hosting a masquerade ball, I believe for Lady Varena’s birthday, in about a week’s time.
Minna (as Myra): Invitation only?
Rhi (as Amancio): It is invitation only, but…
Rhi: He thinks for a minute, flips through his notebook some more.
Rhi (as Amancio): I might know some people who got invited and have some spare invitations that they’re not going to be using if you would like them.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, of course I would like them.
Rhi (as Amancio): Three?
Minna (as Myra): Three.
Rhi (as Amancio): Come back here in a few days and I should have them for you.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you very much.
Rhi (as Amancio): The pleasure’s—Now, in exchange… you have to come back more often, and especially you have to come back and tell me all about it.
Minna (as Myra): [smiling] Now that is a bargain I will happily keep.
Rhi: [laughs] So yeah, you basically know that it’s a masquerade ball, it’s gonna be extremely fancy, dress-up, and you know when and where it is, so you can head home and deliver that news to your compatriots.
Minna: [giggles]
Josie: Minx is still a little bit mopey in The Nest when you get back.
Minna: I think Myra leans over her shoulder.
Minna (as Myra): I’ve got some news that might cheer you up.
Josie (as Minx): Oh?
Minna (as Myra): We’re going to a masquerade ball.
Josie: [grinning] Minx immediately wheels around and looks at you.
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): [gasps] Thank you!
Josie: And she pulls you into a really big hug real quick.
Minna: Myra’s laughing.
Kim: Blaire comes out of her room.
Kim (as Blaire): What now?
Josie (as Minx): We’re going to a masquerade ball, Blaire! This is literally a dream come true! [deep inhale]
Kim (as Blaire): Whoa. What?
Josie (as Minx): I need to go get ready!
[laughter]
Minna (as Myra): Not right now!
Josie: You hear the clicking of her shoes before you register that she’s even left, but she’s in her room.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, please tell me this is score related and you’re not just doing this to cheer her up.
Minna (as Myra): The Evermars are throwing a masquerade ball, and Amancio promises he can get us three invitations.
Kim (as Blaire): Huh.
Minna (as Myra): It may be our best opportunity of getting close to these people.
Rhi: [laughing] At what point does Minx realize she needs to take her friends shopping?
Josie: Probably after about half an hour of strange thumping noises coming from Minx’s room. [laughs] She rushes back down, kind of half put together.
Josie (as Minx): Are you all prepared?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Josie (as Minx): Be honest.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, I mean…
Josie (as Minx): That sounds like we need to go shopping, Blaire. We’re going.
Kim (as Blaire): [squirms]
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): But I already have an outfit that I wear to rich people parties.
Josie (as Minx): But do you have a proper mask?
Kim (as Blaire): Eh…
Josie (as Minx): I think not.
Kim (as Blaire): I’ve got my spirit mask.
Josie (as Minx): That won’t do it, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): What? Why won’t—?
Josie (as Minx): We need something fanciful and delightful and thematic.
Kim (as Blaire): My spirit mask is beautiful! I made it.
Minna (as Myra): It is beautiful, I agree, Blaire, but it is not terribly subtle.
Kim (as Blaire): [whining groan]
Minna (as Myra): If we’re trying to be in disguise. Are we trying to be in disguise?
Kim (as Blaire): We should probably be in disguise.
Josie (as Minx): In so much as I will be hiding in plain sight, I will be in disguise.
Rhi: [laughs] Let’s do a quick shopping montage. Everybody give me one scene from this.
Josie: I kind of like the idea of at the very least Blaire getting really into the mask part, and kind of getting out of Minx’s control a little bit, because Blaire’s going for all the weird and esoteric masks.
Kim: Right.
Josie: And Minx is like, oh heavens no, we still need to stay in fashion, and Blaire is like nope!
Kim (as Blaire): [shrieking] Let me be weird!
[laughter]
Rhi: Blaire, holding like three masks in front of her face at once.
Kim: Yeah, and they’re all based off of Deathlands animals.
Rhi: Yes!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yes, that’s very good!
Kim: She’s holding onto a death crow and an ash bear and the hyena one that we haven’t named all at once.
Rhi: Yeah~
Minna: I think it’s, Myra…
Minna (as Myra): Minx? How do you feel about capes?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, capes are excellent. It’s off season for capes, but I think at a masquerade ball you can get away with it. I think an over-the-shoulder cape would look good on you.
Minna (as Myra): [chuckles] I guess I’ve never worn a cape, but… it’s a masquerade ball.
Josie: Minx will absolutely help Myra find capes, and I wrote a Magpies Quill about capes. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah! [laughs] So, the magpies are going to spend, I imagine, a good chunk of the next week, because this is the kind of thing where you need to have a dress or an outfit tailored to you, so gonna spend a lot of the next week preparing for this party. All right, this is definitely a Social score. You’ve got your invitations to this fancy party. I’m gonna assume everybody’s doing a light load. Engagement roll… [struggles, dice clatter] I just need a handful of dice. Oh my God.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: This is gonna be a 3d6 engagement roll… 4, 5, 6! [laughs]
Kim: Hey!
Josie: Eee!
Rhi: So, you’re gonna be starting off in a controlled position. The night of the masquerade ball celebrating Lady Varena Evermar’s birthday arrives. You all head up into Brightstone and then out onto Bowmore Bridge, which is actually the bridge that leads into Whitecrown, which is the wealthiest district in the city. Myra is the only one who’s ever been there to go to Duskwall Academy. That is where the Lord Governor lives. That is where the city council meetings are held. A lot of the city councilors live out there. Bowmore Bridge stretches between… It’s said to be the largest bridge in the Imperium, it’s an architectural marvel, and all along the edges of this bridge there are very fine townhomes and luxury shops and things, so there are people who live on this bridge stretching between these two districts. The Evermars, their home is in one of these houses along the bridge.
I think you get there pretty close to when the party is starting, so there’s a little bit of a line to get in. I think that we see the Magpies step out of the shadows into the light around this house as you all are approaching the door. So, Myra, what are you wearing to this party?
Minna: Myra is in… it’s kind of like a girly take on Robin Hood, like a short cape in green with white floral embroidery, then a long matching dress underneath, long fingerless gloves with matching fabric and embroidery, a deep hood that she has up for now, and then probably a mask that covers the top half of her face in like… I kind of want to say brown.
Rhi: Does the mask have any embroidery on it? I’m picturing a similar, like, that floral embroidery is the consistent…
Minna: I think it’s actually like brown leather in kind of leaf shapes, like overlapping leaves.
Rhi: Ohh… Cool!
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: That’s very cool. Blaire?
Kim: Yes! So, Blaire famously, as we know, is not a dress girl, but what she pulled together is no less dramatic because of it. I imagine that she took a slight page out of Lord Scurlock’s book as far as fashion goes.
Josie: [smiling] Of course.
Kim: Her outfit is somewhere in between a pantsuit and a cloak combination. She has I would say a cravat on as well as some chains on the lapels of her jacket, but the coattails trail out behind her in a very cape-like fashion, and she does have a hood. Her sleeves, at the shoulders even though are suit-like, as they get past the elbow they become long, billowy, a bit of more feminine sleeves, and she just has pants on top of this combination, a sash on her belt that’s high-waisted, and some pointed dress shoes.
As far as her mask goes, I would say that it’s acceptably spooky, not so spooky that it’s disturbing, it’s kind of like the “oh yeah, you’re going for a creepy thing, that makes sense,” but it’s not enough to scare off some rich people. It’s based off of the lifeseeker crows in the Deathlands, and I imagine it covers the top half of the face, it has jet black feathers maybe with – artificial though, of course, so they kind of have that blue sheen when the light hits it just right, and it has a beak covering the nose.
Rhi: Excellent, and Minx.
Josie: Minx is wearing a long, flowing, deep blue evening gown, not one with a very poofy bottom or corset, just a very trim evening gown with bits at the sides pulled up into pleats. The top half has golden embroidery in sort of swirling patterns meant to kind of suggest wind, and maybe a little bit of stars in there. The collar is a little bit high and is cinched together but leaves a bit of a keyhole underneath it. It’s sleeveless, but she’s wearing matching opera gloves. The whole back is open, pretty much. Peeking out from the dress and across her back are draped silver necklaces and various other jewelries, and her mask is a magpie mask. It’s a magpie in flight, and the beak is kind of where the flair of the nose is, the teal of feathers are around the eyes, and the black tail feathers form a crown at the top of her forehead.
Kim: In other news, I’m gay.
[laughter]
Josie: Good, I’m glad. I included open backs, opera gloves, and a keyhole in this, which are like three of my favorite dress things, and I am fuckin’—
Rhi: Listen. RPGs are a fertile ground for just being unapologetically self-indulgent, and I love it. So the three of you get up to the front doors of the estate, and there is a servant waiting there. As you will see when you get inside, all of the staff are wearing dark blue suits and dark blue domino masks, so it’s not enough to disguise their faces at all but it’s sort of like… they match the rest of the masquerade.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: The young woman who’s standing there takes your invitations, looks at them, there’s no problem at all, puts them in the basket to the side.
Rhi (as servant): Welcome to the Evermar estate. Please, head on inside.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you! It seems I’ve matched the dress code.
Rhi: [chuckles] And yeah, the three of you head in. I think it’s more of a long and narrow foyer, checkerboard tile floor, and there’s a wide staircase at the far end that goes up to a balcony on the second floor that circles the whole foyer. There’s some people who are kind of still mingling in the foyer. There’s a number of rooms off the foyer that are open that people are kind of drifting in and out of. Everyone here is dressed impeccably, latest fashions, beautiful clothes. Everyone is wearing a mask. Kind of from the chatter that you can hear it sounds like the Evermars have not made an appearance yet, they haven’t come downstairs, so you have a little bit of time to just kind of wander around and check the place out, maybe see what you can learn about the Evermars before trying to approach them.
Josie: Yeah. Minx is gonna do that but is gonna be a bit relaxed about it, because she’s just relieved to be able to actually mingle with people and be in her element, so she might just be genuinely participating in conversations and trying to be part of the party here.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: I would like to roll a Study check, since I imagine Blaire is gonna be a bit of a wallflower at this moment, because “high society” isn’t really her thing. She doesn’t know how to talk to people when it’s not about weird shit. [laughter] So yeah, I’m gonna roll a Study.
Rhi: Okay. What are you looking for with the Study roll?
Kim: Just getting a lay of the exits.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs]
Kim: Not that she expects things to get violent, but it’s just kind of a force of habit.
Rhi: Yeah. At this point you’re in a fancy place, you want to know how to leave it quickly.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: That makes sense. Yeah. Go ahead and make that roll.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 3 and a 6.
Rhi: So, because this house is out on a bridge, the exits are a little more limited. In the foyer, it seems like the only way out is the front door, but you kind of- as you sort of- I think you kind of drift around the first floor a little bit. There’s like a parlor and a drawing room that are also open for people to head into and socialize, and there’s a grand dining hall that’s still being set up for a meal, but in those side rooms there are windows that you can tell they look out into an alley on this bridge, so if for some reason you can’t exit through the front doors there are numerous large windows that you could go out through.
Kim: Excellent.
Rhi: Yeah. I think you also notice there’s a cool painting of the Void Sea with a, um… What’s it called when whales come up?
Kim: Breech?
Josie: Breeching?
Rhi: Breeching. Yeah. It’s a breeching leviathan.
Josie: Ooh.
Kim: Aaagh! That’s her shit.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: She’s gonna stare at that and pretend to be sophisticated and understand art for a while.
Rhi: Yeah! [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, and you can study that painting without really drawing any attention to yourself. You also look like the kind of person who’d be staring at that sort of painting, so it works out.
Kim: It does! How about that. Hey.
Rhi: Yeah. Ah, the spooky goth person is staring at the spooky painting.
Kim: Who would have guessed.
Rhi: Yeah. Myra, what are you up to?
Minna: I think I’m working the room, kind of.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Just having conversation, more of a Consort than anything.
Rhi: Yeah. Do you wanna make a roll to see if you can pick up any information?
Minna: That is a 5.
Rhi: Is there particular information you’re looking for? Do you just wanna learn more about your hosts, the people that you’re gonna be trying to…?
Minna: Yeah!
Rhi: Yeah, so, I think just sort of… You can’t really ask a lot of direct questions, because you don’t want to give away that you don’t actually know these people, so you just have to go by what you overhear. There’s chatter about the Evermars’ businesses, they have a fleet of leviathan hunter ships, kind of talking about that. It seems like they have been fairly profitable lately. You do catch a few snide comments about Liege Greer, and they’re all kind of backhanded and not really direct, but you sort of piece together that Greer is not originally of the upper classes.
Minna: Oh.
Rhi: They married into money. They’ve been married for quite some time, over a decade, but there are still people making these snide comments about Greer’s background.
Minna: [disappointed groan]
Rhi: There’s not—You don’t really get anything specifically about how they met or what they were doing prior to marrying Lady Varena, but yeah, you kind of pick up on that from some of the conversations. Minx, do you wanna make a Consort roll, or Sway?
Josie: Well, I’m thinking Sway, because Minx wants to make an impression.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I think Minx is being fairly jovial and telling many tales of exciting, let’s say, ventures she has been involved in, which are reskinned tales of scores we’ve actually been on in the truth of it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Oh no~!
Josie: But, you know, re-spun to not be, to be more to these people’s taste and not admitting to high crimes in front of everyone.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah.
Josie: Yes, and basically my goal is I want to make an impression so people are talking about me, and the Evermars are going to hear about me as soon as they get here.
Rhi: Okay, got it.
Josie: Got a 6.
Rhi: Yeah. I think Myra and Blaire, about half an hour after you get there you both glance around and you see Minx, who is a fairly tall woman, standing in the midst of this circle of recent admirers who are just standing around while Minx is basically holding court.
Josie: [laughing] yes, attention!
Rhi: She’s telling stories, and people will laugh at all the right moments. At some point somebody does kind of playfully tap your arm and is like:
Rhi (as party goer): A magpie mask, that’s so daring of you with those terrible criminals all over the city. Oh, I love it!
Josie (as Minx): I know. I could not resist. This is precisely the sort of thing I live for, you understand.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Blaire over here does a double take.
Josie: I think also as the stories wear thin some of Minx’s fan fiction is making its way in there.
Kim: Ohhh yes!
Rhi: [bursts into laughter, claps]
Josie: Like, the stuff from the Langdon Imports Score.
Rhi: Oh my God! Yes! That’s very good. And they’re eating it up, they love it, you are the best thing that could have ever happened to this party. I think after probably 40-45 minutes after you all arrive there’s sort of that shift in the room as everyone turns towards the stairs and two people start descending. One of them is a tall, tan skinned person, looks like they’re Iruvian. They have short, thick, dark hair, dark eyes, and they are wearing a one-shoulder gown, so it only has the strap across one shoulder and then it goes down.
Kim: Oh, yes.
Josie: Hot.
Rhi: It’s a mostly black gown, but at the shoulder there’s a little silver embroidery in the shape of a crescent moon, and then weaving diagonally down across the dress, down to the bottom of the skirt, is this silver embroidery of stars and then the moon basically going through the phases so that at the bottom of the skirt is a large full moon, and it actually has then the Dimmer Sister pale reflections of the moon on either side.
Then, they are accompanied by a woman wearing a, the whole dress is gold, like ruffle cap sleeves, a very wide collar, she’s wearing some gold jewelry, a little bit of a train and there’s lace that kind of drags along the floor. She is Akorosi, pale skin, dark hair that’s done up in a very fashionable up-do. Yeah, I think as they get to the, not quite bottom of the stairs but a few steps above it, and one of the servants announces:
Rhi (as servant): Honored guests, Lady Varena and Liege Greer Evermar.
Rhi: There’s polite applause from everyone, and I think that both of them have the masks that are on sticks so they can kind of like, oh yes, we’re participating in the masquerade, but they’re not wearing the masks generally.
Kim: It’s so that they can be like, um, do you know who I am.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: A little bit. It’s my party, I’m not covering up my face. So yeah, they both descend the stairs, looking amazing, and kind of are immediately… not mobbed, but gently surrounded by people who are wishing Varena a happy birthday, who are wanting to talk to them. Myra, you sort of notice some of the people who were making snide comments about Greer are now kind of fawning over them and trying to be very flattering.
Kim: Ugh, of course.
Josie: I’m sad all the attention is going away, but I’ll let it happen. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Unfortunately, about half of your crowd breaks off, Minx, but your goal was to have your name dropped to them.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: So I think, um…
Josie: And for the sake of completeness, I think my alias currently is Lady Crawford.
Rhi: Okay. I think that after a little bit Greer does break off from their wife and heads off into one of the side rooms, and nobody really seems to go after them to continue a conversation.
Josie: Minx will approach and knock politely.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that they are… so, there’s servants walking around with drinks, but there’s also like, [laughs] they’re unlocking a cabinet to get out something a little stiffer.
Josie: [laughing] Uh-huh.
Rhi: So I think they kind of startle and straighten up.
Rhi (as Greer): Oh. No need to knock, our home is open to all of our guests, although I… well, it’s probably just the mask, I don’t entirely recognize you right now.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, well, it’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance then. I am Lady Crawford. I am very glad you hosted this. Happy birthday to your wife, by the way.
Rhi (as Greer): [chuckles] Oh, thank you, I will be happy to pass that along. She’s been hearing that from everyone out there.
Kim (as Blaire): Lyra Langdon, of Langdon Imports. So wonderful to finally meet you.
Rhi (as Greer): A pleasure.
Kim: And she shakes hands.
Minna (as Myra): Selma Merryweather.
Rhi (as Greer): A pleasure to meet you as well. Did you need me for something?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. We’d actually been hoping to talk with you this evening, not business but it may lead to business.
Rhi (as Greer): Oh! Are you sure that you’re looking for me, then? Varena usually handles most of the business side of affairs.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re simply here to gauge interest.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi (as Greer): All right.
Josie (as Minx): Although, if she wishes to join us that would of course be welcome.
Rhi (as Greer): I can hear you out and decide if it’ll be worth her time to bring her in. What sort of business?
Josie (as Minx): You are aware of a man by the name of Hagen? From what I understand, known in the medical world, outside Charhollow.
Rhi: So, they, for a split second, kind of scowl and then quickly rearrange their face into sort of that, that like, polite—
Rhi (as Greer): Oh, Dr. Hagen, yes. I’ve heard of some of his work. I don’t have any sort of personal connection. We’ve never made use of his services, but I’ve heard the name.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, we have heard and seen quite a bit of his work also, and I know it is a masquerade ball, but regarding that I do not think we need to hide behind a mask regarding the man.
Rhi: Hmm, give me a roll.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Do you want an assist?
Josie: Yes please.
Kim: Okay, you can have it.
Rhi: All right, so you’ll take 1 stress, Blaire, and then what are you rolling?
Josie: I’m trying to decide between Consort and Sway, because I’m trying to persuade to be honest.
Rhi: That feels like Consort, because you’re explicitly saying I’m trying to be open with you here.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: So, I think Greer kind of studies you for a moment. They are willing to hear you out, they’re clearly going to listen to you, but they’re still being a little cagey in terms of their own reaction. I’m just going with, again, kind of the reduced effect thing.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: They basically kind of…
Rhi (as Greer): What is your interest in Dr. Hagen’s work, and why would you wish to speak with me about it?
Josie (as Minx): Well, the manner in which he proceeds is a dead end, and other avenues need to be explored. Of course, one of his stature, his position is not easily turned over to just anyone.
Rhi (as Greer): I am not a physicker of any kind.
Josie (as Minx): Of course, of course, but of course we mean the clinic as an institution rather than the position of head physicker.
Rhi: They sort of frown at you again.
Rhi (as Greer): What exactly do you want from me here?
Minna (as Myra): Could we speak privately?
Rhi: Give me another roll.
Minna: Six.
Rhi: Okay! Nice. I assume that was Consort.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. So, Greer kind of looks the three of you over again, and their gaze hangs on Minx’s mask for just a second long, and then they look back at Myra and go:
Rhi (as Greer): Yes… I think we can do that.
Rhi: They gesture for you to follow them back through the foyer and then down past the stairs, and they open up a back sitting room that, it’s not a mess, but it clearly was not intended to be open to the public.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It looks like a family room more. The furniture in here is a little more chosen for comfort rather than appearance. There are children’s toys that are tucked away in the corners. It’s a much homier space than the rest of what you’ve seen so far. They bring you in and I think gesture at a couch like they’re about to invite you to sit, and then stop and move a pillow aside and pull out a doll. [laughs]
Minna: Aw.
Josie: [laughs] Aw.
Rhi: Put the pillow back.
Rhi (as Greer): Sorry. Please, have a seat.
Rhi: And then they go over and set the doll with the rest of the kids’ toys.
Rhi (as Greer): Our children have a somewhat strange relationship with the concept of cleaning up.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] I understand completely.
Rhi: I imagine the three of you are on this couch, and they sit down across from you and seem to be a bit more relaxed.
Rhi (as Greer): If you could speak a bit more plainly about what your interest is with Hagen’s clinic and with me and my wife.
Minna: I think Myra glances sideways at Minx to see…
Josie (as Minx): Yes, and for once that will be a relief. Hagen… his work kills people, and that needs to end, and Hagen himself will soon end, but—
Rhi: I think when you say that they hold up their hands.
Rhi (as Greer): Please don’t tell me any details.
Josie (as Minx): As you wish, but a clinic of that size could do a lot of work for that area. Where are you from, by the way?
Rhi: I think that they give you a kind of self-deprecating smile.
Rhi (as Greer): Barrowcleft, believe it or not.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, I see. I’m from Charhollow myself.
Minna (as Myra): Myself as well.
Kim (as Blaire): I hail from Tycheros, so I know a little bit about being an outsider.
Rhi (as Greer): Yes, well, that would certainly explain your interest in the place, I suppose.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, and it’s not something that can simply go away, but we cannot risk another Hagen being in charge.
Rhi (as Greer): As I said, I’m not a physicker. Are you…
Kim (as Blaire): We’re in the business of transferring ownership, and we need benefactors if we are to do that.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi (as Greer): [inhales] Ahhh… you need funding.
Minna (as Myra): We need funding.
Rhi (as Greer): A patron?
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Greer): I see… If Dr. Hagen were to resign his position, what… Do you have someone in mind to take over running the place?
Josie (as Minx): We have ties in that field. We are still picking someone specific out.
Kim (as Blaire): My business, Langdon Imports, has seen Hagen’s work up close, and since learning of his cruelty we’ve terminated his contract, and that has motivated our business into possibly taking this side venture into bettering the building and looking into physickers.
Rhi (as Greer): I see… [exhales] Well, maintaining a place like that isn’t going to be cheap.
Josie (as Minx): No doubt.
Rhi (as Greer): But, what is your timeline for the clinic becoming available for a new patron?
Josie (as Minx): As soon as possible.
Rhi (as Greer): I see.
Josie (as Minx): Just this week we attended the funeral of someone who went there. It cannot be allowed to stand.
Rhi: Their face kind of falls a little bit and they nod.
Rhi (as Greer): Very well. I’ll speak to Varena. She’s sympathetic to these sort of causes.
Rhi: Again, there’s that self-deprecating smile.
Josie (as Minx): Also, do not feel compelled to do so just because of the mask I wear.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispering] Minx!
Rhi: Greer kind of pauses for a moment and looks the three of you over.
Rhi (as Greer): I still have some family and friends down in that part of the city, and I think I hear some very different stories about the work that certain people are doing than perhaps most of the company that my wife keeps.
Josie (as Minx): That is good to hear.
Rhi: Greer will nod thoughtfully.
Rhi (as Greer): I’ll speak with Varena and see what we can arrange. What would be the best way to contact you once we’ve come to some sort of agreement?
Josie: I think our stuff comes through The Hound’s Paw, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, so Minx will give them the details on that.
Rhi: They nod. They look very thoughtful.
Rhi (as Greer): This is not precisely what I expected to be discussing this evening, but I think it’s been a worthwhile use of time.
Rhi: They will stand up and straighten out their skirt.
Rhi (as Greer): Now, I do need to get back out there before someone comes looking for me.
Josie (as Minx): Indeed, although perhaps in the future there can be meetings that are not so tainted by business.
Rhi: Again, that thoughtful look.
Rhi (as Greer): We shall see.
Minna: [giggles]
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you very much for hearing out our proposal, Liege Greer.
Rhi: They nod at you and will, uh, they escort you back out. They’re not gonna leave you hanging out in their private area of the house, and then they’ll head back over. I think to all three of you it’s sort of a familiar thing of you can kind of see the posture and body language and facial expression all shift as they move back into “Liege Greer,” playing that role.
Josie: [laughs] Right.
Minna: Aww.
Kim (as Blaire): Holy shit, they heard us out and didn’t call the muscle on us.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Given who I heard about them from, I figured tonight might go better than usual.
Kim (as Blaire): It was a nice move with the mask, though.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, but I think in an altruistic endeavor like this we can’t stand on disguises.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I don’t think we would have kept the disguise once the deal was made, or even before the deal was made. It would not be fair to ask them to involve themselves in something without knowing who we are.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think we can turn that hard maybe into a yes by talking to their wife?
Minna (as Myra): I think we need to give them time to contemplate.
Josie (as Minx): Now, if you’ll excuse me, I was in the midst of a story.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know about you, Myra, but I don’t have much to do right now.
Minna (as Myra): Heh. I don’t have much to do. What were you thinking?
Kim (as Blaire): Do you wanna dance?
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I will dance with you.
Josie: [gasps] Aww!
Rhi: [gasps, giggles]
Kim (as Blaire): I’m warning you, I’m kind of… [squirms] I’m a horrible dancer.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think I’ve ever been taught to dance the way that they’re dancing here.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Well, we could always just watch them and then figure it out, right?
Minna (as Myra): We’ll just have fun with it.
Josie: [yelping and other noises as she tries to restrain herself]
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think these guys are kind of the type to have fun, though? They seem very traditional.
Minna (as Myra): Well, we’re not trying to make friends with any of them except Greer and Varena, and I very much doubt they care.
Kim (as Blaire): All right, well… Yeah, no, I guess if we don’t look too weird then maybe it’s okay.
Minna (as Myra): Since when are you worried about looking weird?
Kim (as Blaire): Since you put me in a room full of rich people.
Minna (as Myra): Forget about the rich people. Just be yourself.
Kim (as Blaire): But…
Minna: Myra’s literally taking her hand and dragging her out onto the dance floor at this point.
Kim (as Blaire): [grunts in resistance] Myra!
Rhi: [giggles]
Josie: Rhi, help! This is so cute!
Rhi: It’s really cute. There’s a string quartet that I think right around, like right before Blaire had said do you want to dance, had started up. God, I want some kind of roll to figure out how well you do on dancing.
Kim: Agh!
Minna: Is it Finesse?
Rhi: It’s not gonna come with—It’s not gonna have any stress. This will be a fortune roll, so whatever ability you think is best suited.
Kim: I’m going to roll Finesse, because oh God, Blaire is so scared now.
Josie: Oh! Aww!
Minna: Yeah, I think it’s Finesse.
Rhi: Yeah, okay, both of you roll Finesse. We’ll treat it as a—
Kim: I’m pushing myself for it.
Rhi: Oh my God! [laughs]
Kim: I have the stress to spare and I only have 1 in Finesse!
Josie: [stammers]
Rhi: [delighted, softly] Okay. [giggles]
Josie: This is a no consequence roll!
Kim: But I wanna have the extra dice!
Rhi: [smiling] Let her do it. Let her do it. Let her do it.
Kim: Oh God! Okay. Good thing I had the extra dice. That’s a 2 and a 6.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I got a 4.
Rhi: Four, okay, so then since it’s technically a group action…
Kim: [laughs]
Minna: Nobody takes stress.
Rhi: No, nobody takes stress, it’s a 6, and yeah… Somehow the two of you manage to, you know, I think you maybe do spend a little bit of time watching everybody else, and you’re like okay, yeah, we can do that, and then yeah, you’re just dancing around the foyer with the handful of other folks who are dancing. It’s not a huge party. There’s probably only about 30 or 40 people here total, which compared to some of the other parties you’ve been to is a small crowd.
Minna: Can I insert really quick?
Rhi: Yeah-yeah.
Minna: Who leads?
Kim: I think Myra leads… Well, Myra did get a 4, but Myra’s taller.
Minna: [giggles]
Josie: Yeah. I think it’s cuter if Myra leads.
Minna: Cute.
Rhi: Yeah~
Josie: But it’s already, like, I’m flailing around in my chair cute.
Rhi: [giggles]
Kim: Minna, I have an idea for a quick convo if you want.
Minna: Yes!
Kim: While we dance. [chuckles]
Minna: Yes!
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, that… Are people staring?
Minna (as Myra): Nobody’s staring. Well, Greer is staring a little bit, but [chuckles] I think that’s to be expected.
Kim (as Blaire): What you said earlier about being myself… it’s hard to do around strangers.
Minna (as Myra): I understand.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know if you do… I’m weird. I know that I’m not afraid to be weird when I’m with all of you, but… we’re trying to get rich people on our side here and I need to be really careful not to scare people away.
Minna (as Myra): I think in this case a little dancing, a little bit of awkwardness on the floor isn’t going to sway anybody who matters.
Kim (as Blaire): Egh… It’s not just the dancing, it’s all of me.
Minna (as Myra): I will say, to some extent, I can understand where you’re coming from. It’s very difficult to open yourself up and let yourself be whoever you wanna be, but I think it’s worthwhile work, don’t you? If we’re trying to change this city to let other people have better lives, maybe we can believe that we can let ourselves show just a little bit sometimes.
Kim (as Blaire): I guess it is a small price to pay. A little bit of personal discomfort is really nothing if we’re trying to change an entire system. I can do that.
Minna (as Myra): And maybe it’ll become personal comfort. You never know.
Kim (as Blaire): [giggles] I don’t think parties are gonna be my kind of personal comfort.
Minna (as Myra): Maybe we just need to find the right party.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m banned from every library in the city, though, you forget.
Minna (as Myra): Oh no! You are!
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah…
Josie: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Blaire… We have to sneak you in one of these days.
Kim (as Blaire): Hmm?
Minna (as Myra): I mean, I have access to a number of libraries. I don’t want to burn any bridges…
Kim (as Blaire): I’m banned from all of them, and they would clock me immediately unless I went in with a disguise.
Minna (as Myra): [scandalized sigh] Well, you let me know if there’s any research you need out of them.
Kim (as Blaire): [exhales] Yeah, I will.
Rhi: [light airy sigh, smiling] Ah, God, this is so good. These good friends. This good character development! So yeah, I think that honestly the three of you have a nice time at this party. I think that… particularly I think when you, like, there is a meal here, you all get dinner and it is really nice, and I think that there’s probably a moment—
Kim: Do they have fruit?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Ohh!
Rhi: There’s fruit. There’s vegetables.
Kim: Oh my God! I don’t know if Blaire has ever had a fresh vegetable.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that you’re hopeful that this is going to work out in a way where, you know, some of the money that’s being spent on all of this finery might be turned towards helping more of the people in this city.
## Downtime [1:19:07]
Rhi: Okay! So, for downtime, where do we find Minx and Myra during their downtime here?
Josie: I think Minx is going over what we know of Hagen’s clinic, like written down, but she’s kind of only half paying attention and is just like (humming). She still has the Magpies mask on the table next to her.
Minna: [giggles]
Josie: She’s still kind of riding that high a little bit.
Minna: I think Myra sets a cup of tea next to her elbow.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, thank you!
Minna (as Myra): Of course. Looked like you could use it.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, it’s always a good time for tea.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Josie: She’ll take a sip.
Josie (as Minx): it has been a long time since we’ve gotten to go to a party and… yes, just socialize like that. I’ve missed it.
Minna (as Myra): You still enjoy that?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, of course, if for no other reason than the attention. Ahem.
Minna (as Myra): I know you didn’t have such a good experience with The Centuralia Club and I had wondered.
Josie (as Minx): I… I mean, that was a bit of an eye opener, but…
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Yes, but there’s no reason I can’t still enjoy a party now and then.
Minna (as Myra): Of course.
Josie (as Minx): It’s not really the wealth itself, you understand, it’s more the bringing everyone together under one roof and having a good time.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, and they’re really able to indulge in that kind of… completely given into luxury in a way that most people can’t, so I can really see the appeal there.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, and like, it’s not just for me. Hopefully Bazso and Nyryx can find their own way, but secretly I kind of hope to just burst onto the scene as a radical new money noble and sweep them both up in my wealthy shenanigans.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Is that why you got into this kind of thing?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. It was more about me at first, but definitely… well, there was Bazso, and then we had that falling out, and then we talked, and then had another falling out, so…
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I don’t know where he stands on it, but I’m thinking Nyryx is definitely part of that future now
Minna (as Myra): Sorry that you ended up with a crew that really isn’t going anywhere fast in terms of riches.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I think I am more comfortable knowing that we have made a difference than indulging my own personal tastes. That’s a bit more spiritually satisfying, don’t you think?
Minna (as Myra): Certainly. I agree.
Josie (as Minx): Of course, that’s all presuming we can actually make a lasting change. I don’t mean to be negative, but…
Minna (as Myra): No, I mean, at this point it’s all faith, isn’t it?
Josie (as Minx): yeah… yeah, I suppose. Speaking of, there do seem to be a lot of forgotten gods in our path. Huh.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know if it’s Blaire or if we just got lucky that way.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] Perhaps a bit of both.
Minna (as Myra): Probably both.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah… You know, that stuff seems like it affects everyone, and I’m starting to become less able to ignore it. I mean, Blaire’s got her stuff, you’ve been affected, Nyryx and I have our own things, and I’m just over here in my little no mystic things bubble.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. Well, you’ve got two people who can try and help you fend off any of that kind of thing, so there’s… if you’re not able to, that’s fine.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] I appreciate that, really.
Minna (as Myra): It’s so strange. They have money, but it’s still not enough for these people.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I truly do not understand it. I can internalize trends and rules and faux pas and social agreements, but I cannot understand having everything you need and more and just wanting more.
Minna (as Myra): I mean, clearly not a mindset I understand either.
Josie (as Minx): Heh. Well, even if we don’t make a lasting difference hopefully there are a significant number of folks taken down a peg.
Minna (as Myra): This might be strange to ask.
Josie (as Minx): Hmm?
Minna (as Myra): While I’m being nosey. Heh.
Josie (as Minx): Oh no, it’s a welcome change, honestly.
Minna (as Myra): You have a voice you usually use, and I understand that, you know, that’s the one that you choose. I’ve just noticed that occasionally you slip into other voices and it doesn’t seem to be… I don’t know. I just wondered if everything was all right, I guess.
Josie (as Minx): Oh! Um… Heh. Well, I um… [clears throat] I try to comport myself with an air of dignity and grace, and I try to speak to that fashion… As you know, I didn’t really come from that, and can speak in other ways if I want to. As to whether I’m okay… Huh. You know, I don’t think I really know.
Minna (as Myra): We don’t have a lot of time to stop and reflect in our life.
Josie (as Minx): No, and you’re right, recently it’s been harder to keep my usual perfect, put together self.
Minna (as Myra): is that something you prefer, or is it just something you learned to do to survive?
Josie (as Minx): I… I mean… The voice I use as Ellie is more the one for survival. Ellie is who I came from.
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): And who I still am, really. Minx is who I am attempting to choose to be.
Minna (as Myra): I think who you choose to be is who you are.
Josie (as Minx): I… I’m not so certain, because these days it seems more and more we must end lives and endanger ourselves and others and put ourselves in situations where, where I have to be more Ellie?
Minna (as Myra): So what are the values that Minx embodies that you’re afraid you’re having to throw away?
Josie (as Minx): Well, class, sophistication, kindness, nurturing… Ellie’s, I used to be, believe it or not, more violent, out of necessity you understand. All three of us were, by necessity, violent children. Ellie’s more cold, I suppose, and I don’t like that.
Minna (as Myra): I’ve never thought of you as a particularly cold person, and I think even now when we’re having to be more violent you are still opening yourself up to kindness and you care about people. It’s one of the things I admire about you.
Josie (as Minx): [squirms] Well, thank you, Myra. I’m not certain I can agree. I certainly try, but… Thank you.
Minna: I think Myra stands up at this point and just kind of leans over and kisses the side of Minx’s head.
Minna (as Myra): You let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.
Josie: Minx sort of blushes a little bit.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Thank you, Myra. You know you can ask the same of me.
Minna (as Myra): I do know.
Rhi: I think a couple days after that you all had some time to wind down from the party, you’ve all gone to see Seeks again, maybe talked to Seeks a little bit about some of your plans, but you do head back over to The Hound’s paw to check in with Rigney, see about your messages. And yeah, Rigney will give you a few notes and things. Some of them are just from some of your other contacts around the city checking in saying, you know, here’s what we know, part of Myra’s information network, but there is an envelope on very nice, thick paper that has a wax seal on the back that you open up. It’s very nice paper and ink, but the handwriting is, eh, not the greatest.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: It is just a brief note saying that should the clinic currently owned by Dr. Hagen become available for new ownership the Evermar family is willing to commit a number of, you know, an amount of money that comes out to roughly 8 coin a month to the upkeep and maintenance of a clinic that would serve the people of Duskwall. I think it’s actually phrased as “serve all the people of Duskwall,” and it is signed Liege Greer Evermar.

## Blooper [1:29:14]
Kim (as Blaire): Like finding a needle in a haystack.
Kim: Sorry. We don’t have haystacks, do we?
Rhi: Um…
Kim: Because hay is…
Rhi: Yeah, probably not. Yeah.
Kim: All right, so I have to come up with a sea equivalent.
Rhi: This… yeah. [chuckles]
Kim (as Blaire): But, it feels like finding a needle in a pile of bones.
Rhi: Jesus!
Minna: A pile of what?! [giggles]
Josie: [laughs nervously]
Rhi: Pile of bone!
Kim: I- I- I just—
Josie: I mean, that’s a Blaire thing to say.
Kim: I went with the first—
Rhi: That’s very good. [chuckles]
Kim: The first Blaire thing that came up, I was just like, okay we don’t have hay, what do we have? I know this setting doesn’t have a lot of herbs. So what do we do? Blaire works a lot with bones. If she does taxidermy or dissects stuff she probably has a lot of amphibious or bird bones lying around that are very needle like. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah… Yeah, no…
Josie: Yeah, I mean…
Minna: I was gonna say a pearl in a mushroom tunnel or something like that. [laughs]
Rhi: Nope! Nope!
Minna: I love the bones.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, it’s real good."

##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. You can support us in all the usual ways, in Patreon, via our Shapeways store, by leaving reviews, and by tweeting about the show. Any support you can give us is a huge help and we are so grateful for all of it.
I was lucky enough to be the guest GM on She’s a Super Geek for their January episodes of Descent into Midnight. The second episode is out today, so after you finish listening to The Magpies go check it out. And check out Descent into Midnight as well. It’s an incredible game that has inspired some amazing, creative, and deeply emotional stories. It will be on Kickstarter next month, and as the accessibility consultant on the game, I’m really excited to see the game move out of play testing and into publication. You’ll be hearing a lot more about it once the Kickstarter begins.
Also, fans of Discworld and fans of Minna should check out the Compleat Discography podcast. It just launched earlier this month so you can get in on the ground floor. There’s a link in the show notes, but if you’re going to search for it, please note that ‘complete’ is spelled C-O-M-P-L-E-A-T.
Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Josie: Hi Magpies lovelies. Two things for featured charity this time. Obviously, the Australian wildfires are insane. There’s tons of charities for those, donate to that, that’s top priority right now. There’s so many people without their homes. But also, I just wanted to plug individual trans fundraisers again. Um, because I am not super happy with most trans charities right now. So, please check in with your trans friends, find trans people to follow, send them money, look out for their fundraisers. So many of my trans friends are still in poverty and not seeing, uh, jack of shit from most charity organizations. So, #TransCrowdFund, anything like that. Whenever I see a trans person with a fundraiser up I try and retweet it, so follow me on Twitter if you need help finding stuff. Um, yeah, that’s my push for featured charity this month. Thanks.
Rhi: Please continue to take action when and where you can, wherever you are and whatever your means. Make calls, write letters, attend protests, educate yourself and others. And take care of yourself and the people around you, too.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [00.03.11]
Rhi: So, we are going to start with a flashback. Previously, The Magpies had a quite nice time at a masquerade ball hosted by the Evermar family, who despite being wealthy are not the worst people, they make a lot of charitable donations. And after speaking with Liege Greer Evermar, found that they would be willing to provide financial support for a clinic that would actually take care of the people who were in need of medial care, as opposed to the clinic that is currently on offer, which is a clinic run by one Doctor Elias Hagen, who recruits people into medical experiments in exchange for money that’s ultimately not worth it. So, The Magpies are still recovering from some injuries sustained during their train heist. And we find them making their way towards the clinic run by physicker and friend, Seeks. Tell me about the neighborhood around the clinic. How has it changed since the last time we were here on the show?
Waffles: Okay. It’s a lot brighter. There are a lot more people here, out and about, I would say. I think you’ve noticed as you’ve been visiting the neighborhood, it’s just gotten a lot better. And that’s because, you know, people who cause trouble here disappear. There are no Bluecoat patrols within this certain block radius of Seeks’s building, and a lot more stores have opened up around Seek’s building. We might have killed the uh, [laughs] the landlord and stolen the property.
Kim: [laughs]
Minna: So ‘steal a building’ is Seeks’s MO.
Rhi: No one’s ever proved that. The landlord could have moved away.
Waffles: True. And this building is unsellable due to a number of weird law loopholes.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s fine.
Waffles: It’s fine.
Rhi: And really, the people who were asking questions have also decided to move somewhere else.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: So, no one asks questions anymore.
Waffles: Mm hmm.
Josie: They all moved to this farm upstate.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Exactly, they’re very happy there. What is the scene when you get in, or when they get in there? What is Seeks up to, Waffles?
Waffles: Probably doing physicker things.
Rhi: You think you have another patient in there, or are you, like, preparing?
Waffles: I’m probably— the industrial district is still the industrial district, so people get injured.
Rhi: So, yeah, I think there’s a person there. Looks like they are in, probably, their mid-twenties. They have, uh, I think Seeks has been treating some burns on their arm for the last, you know, couple weeks. And it’s looking pretty good now. There’s still a little bit of that, like, pink sort of fresh-looking scar tissue, but it’s healed up nicely. And I think Seeks has, like, just finished wrapping up a fresh layer of bandages as The Magpies come in.
Josie (as Minx): Hello, dear.
Waffles (as Seeks): Hello, friends!
Josie (as Minx): For once, we’re not asking for your physicker assistance.
Waffles (as Seeks): Okay. Again, re-wrap this every morning and put this on it.
Waffles: And scoots them out the door. [laughs]
Rhi (as Patient): It smells like kelp.
Waffles (as Seeks): It is kelp!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi (as Patient): Oh. Okay. Thank you!
Waffles (as Seeks): And other things. But, you know, mostly kelp.
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t forget that kelp helps.
Waffles (as Seeks): Kelp does help. That is very catchy.
Rhi: Yeah, other person heads on out the door.
Waffles (as Seeks): Hello, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi.
Waffles (as Seeks): Minx. Friends. Hugs!
Josie (as Minx): Hello, dear.
Minna (as Myra): Hello.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah!
Josie (as Minx): Oh!
Kim: Blaire hugs Seeks.
Waffles (as Seeks): How is everything?
Kim (as Blaire): Good.
Rhi: Waffles, so you know, Seeks has been treating all of them for various— I think the last times that they’ve all been in, Minx and Myra had been shot, Blaire had been mildly electrocuted—
Kim: And bruised. Ish. A lot.
Rhi: Bruised, yeah, lots of— they’ve been pretty badly injured recently when you’ve seen them. But they look okay today. No new injuries, anyway.
Waffles (as Seeks): No angry iron bits today?
Josie (as Minx): No. Not yet, rather.
Waffles (as Seeks): Are we planning on angry iron bits today?
Minna (as Myra): Almost certainly.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps. We are aiming to steal a whole hospital, after all.
Waffles (as Seeks): [gasps]
Minna: [laughs]
Waffles (as Seeks): Is it time?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! It’s time.
Waffles (as Seeks): Ooh.
Josie (as Minx): It’s time.
Waffles (as Seeks): Let me get my things.
[laughter]
Josie (as Minx): And you are alright being potentially in charge of such a facility?
Waffles (as Seeks): What was that?
Waffles: The sound of things being thrown about in the background. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Do you wanna be in charge of the hospital after we steal it?
Waffles (as Seeks): Uh… I guess?
Kim (as Blaire): Are you okay with that?
Waffles (as Seeks): Uh… I don’t know. Probably.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Waffles (as Seeks): What does that entail? Is it just like this, but bigger?
Kim (as Blaire): I guess. I don’t know, I don’t run a hospital.
Josie (as Minx): You’ll have assistants, I suppose.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh. No other witches?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, you can hire witches if you want to.
Waffles (as Seeks): I think that would be for the best.
Kim (as Blaire): Just, yeah, have it be a witch hospital.
Rhi: Yeah, so I assume Seeks re-emerges with a bag laden with stuff to be determined later.
Waffles: Stuff. Mm hmm.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Waffles: There’s a large number of clunking metal noises as she drops the bag on the counter.
Josie: Ah, so a heavy load then. [laughs]
Minna and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: So, in terms of kinda how you wanna proceed to prep for this score. Last time you were there, between, you know, the three of you who broke in previously, Blaire doesn’t really know the lay of the land, but the others can fill her in, you all got a good sense of where stuff is in the hospital, you know about the available entrances. There is sort of the main entrance in the front of the building. The building itself is in Charterhall, just across one of the bridges into Coalridge. It’s three stories, very few windows, only a few on the ground floor, none on the second and third, so your frequently-employed tactic of breaking in on an upper level will not work here. However, in addition to the front door there is a dock on the river behind the building that has a back exit into the basement, so that is a way that you could possibly get in a little more subtly. If you wanna go subtle.
Josie: Yes. Well, first some points of clarification.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: We have Liege Greer as funding.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Will they technically own the place, or will Seeks technically own the place?
Rhi: The Evermars are gonna own the place. It will be in their name.
Josie: I see. So, the legal aspect of this we have covered. We just need to free up the space for purchase.
Rhi: Right. Yeah, yeah. It needs— you have a willing buyer and funder, you just need to make sure that it ends up on the market.
Josie: Right.
Kim: We can do that.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, that is the plan.
Waffles (as Seeks): So, what we’re saying is we just need to remove… what was his name?
Minna (as Myra): The tumor.
Rhi: Hagen.
Waffles (as Seeks): Hagen.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Waffles (as Seeks): Who has a tumor?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, no… what?
Minna (as Myra): Making a perhaps terrible joke that Hagen is the tumor that we are going to remove from the clinic.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh… well, that’s good.
Rhi: In terms of kind of prep for this, you all have— you’re going to get an advantage on the engagement roll just kinda out of the gate, because you’ve been here before. If there’s other info that you wanna gather, or other prep work you wanna do in terms of kind of laying groundwork for however you’re gonna go after this guy?
Minna: Finding out where that funding comes from might be important, because if they’re stubborn and they wanna maintain a clinic there, they might just buy the clinic again.
Josie: Yes. And frankly, I’m not certain just removing Hagen will put it on the market. It’s entirely possible…
Minna: Yeah, do we know that Hagen owns it?
Rhi: I don’t think that you’ve looked into that too closely. You could.
Minna: And we don’t know what his will looks like either.
Waffles: We should kidnap him and ask.
Kim: Or we could kill him.
Waffles: We could do that after asking.
Josie: This will most likely end with murder, but we need something beyond the murder.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, I know that we’ve had people go poking around in the records to find out real estate ownership type things in the past. So that is a Gather Info that could be done.
Kim: I had a different idea for my own Gather Info, so…
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I don’t know how useful it would be for the whole crew except for myself, but I was thinking that for my Gather Info, Blaire would be spending it looking into how haunted the place is. Because I’m guessing that a lot of people have died here and she would like to know what she’s getting into.
Rhi: [delighted giggling] That actually would be intensely useful.
Minna: Ghost riot two.
Josie: Good call. I want to learn more about Hagen himself. I think I did that the first time around and got a whole lot of not much.
Rhi: You did. Yeah, well I can kind of refresh you on what you learned. He lives in Brightstone, is married, I think I said his husband is like a teacher at Charterhall, something like that. Or at Doskvol Academy. I don’t remember the specifics.
Josie: Oh, he is married. Interesting.
Rhi: He’s very wealthy, or, well, I mean, he’s not very wealthy like nobility, but he’s well off. Not a super social person, but is still well-liked amongst the nobility because he will do, like, for the nobility he provides a lot of very high-quality medical care. Like, he will show up and do house calls and take care of people and is very well-liked amongst the upper classes.
Josie: Okay, okay. That may be useful, actually. I think I might have a plan to get him out of the building.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Which would make the murder much easier.
Rhi: [laughs] Minna, did you wanna have Myra go and check on the paperwork for the building?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Waffles, did you wanna do a separate Gather Info or tag along with somebody, or…?
Waffles: I could tag along with somebody. If we wanna figure out how ghosty it is, I have Ghost Ward, which is the dopest new ability.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, so how about Seeks and Blaire can check out the ghost levels of the building. Let’s start with Myra looking into that paperwork. So, yeah, go ahead and roll something for presumably going back to the records hall in Charterhall, where you spend a lot of time.
Minna: It’s 5.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re actually able to find kind of the records on this place pretty easily. You dig through these papers. Hagen does own the building, he owns the clinic. It’s all in his name. But a lot of the financing, kind of the, you know, you dig way, way, way back when it was initially purchased, you know, a couple decades ago. One of the people who was involved in the payment for the place is someone named Dunvil. And their, um, the sort of contract involving that payment that this Dunvil person has signed is from The Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh.
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: They helped originally purchase this place. Now, they do not own it at the moment, it is legally in Hagen’s name, but they were involved.
Minna: So, we also have to contend with making sure the Church doesn’t start the place back up. Is there any reason that they wouldn’t want the building?
Kim: If we made it more haunted.
Minna: If it’s more haunted will they not want it?
Rhi: It’s a question of you don’t know how valuable it’s been to them. So far.
Josie: And like, too much ghost activity will just have the Spirit Wardens come in and clean it up.
Rhi: Yes. You have run into that problem rather recently.
Josie: And given that the building does not appear to be full to bursting with ghosts, that has likely already happened some number of times.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: That being said, I think I may actually want to Gather Information amongst my goth friends.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Hi.
Josie: Who—
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Hello, Blaire. [laughs] Who I imagine aren’t particularly fond of the Church.
Rhi: They follow, uh, I think that they were attached to a Forgotten God, so they would not be fond. So yeah, go ahead and roll a Gather Info there.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: 6, okay. So, what info are you looking to get from them?
Josie: I want to know what they know about the Church’s connection to this place and, you know, maybe whether they’d be willing to sever that connection.
Rhi: Okay. So, what— and you got a 6. And I think, if I recall correctly, a lot of the folks that you knew here were a little more, like, upper class type folks, right?
Josie: Right. Or dilletantes.
Rhi: Yes, yes, that’s the word. Okay.
Josie: Also, did we ever establish which Forgotten God they were into, or is it kind of a—
Rhi: We did but I don’t remember. [laughs]
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Let me actually take a look real quick, I might be able to remember… um… yeah, it was The Dream Beyond Death, is the Forgotten God that they are into.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: And they’re, a lot of— the reason that you ended up getting connected with them is because a lot of their rituals involve the creation of idols and artwork. They are, like, they’re goth artists.
Josie: Right. [laughs]
Rhi: So you’re looking for… kind of trying to set up a way to interfere with the Church being able to reclaim this place after you get rid of Hagen, right?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think that in talking with them, you’re able to find out that there’s more experiments that kind of go on there than what are advertised. Some of these kids have heard, like, you know, their parents talking about the good work that Hagen is doing on behalf of the Church.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: And what you, like, this is very common knowledge that all of the you would know about the Church of Ecstasy, is that their whole ethos is that the physical is sacred, the spiritual, the soul, that is all an abomination. They believe that, like, for a while they held a belief that demons were like the purest form of existence because demons don’t have souls. That has kind of fallen out of favor, mostly because demons are not really sanctioned by the powers that be and you don’t really become a state religion if you’re talking about how cool demons are.
Kim: I mean….
Rhi: [laughs] So, they are very opposed to any kind of spiritualism and ghosts and the like. And Hagen is apparently doing some— some of his experiments are on behalf of the Church. In terms of interfering… huh. I’m trying to think of what that could look like.
Josie: Yeah, well a lot of them are like, young artists and stuff, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah. I feel like they could have, like, a small movement or, like, I don’t know. They are a young artists cult. Mark the building in some way to be like, “Nope. Ours.”
Rhi: Oh, interesting. Maybe in some way that would make it unappealing to the Church.
Josie: Yeah, make it profane somehow. Which might link up with Blaire’s ghost things.
Kim: Right, I was gonna say, maybe it starts worshipping ghosts or something.
Rhi: Okay. That actually could tie in to that new ability that Seeks has, to make it—cause the Ghost Ward thing can either drive ghosts off or attract ghosts.
Josie: Mm hmm. Maybe some mural that, so like, to those in the know is like, “This is old god marking, stay away,” but is just like, you know, to the every day public is like, “Oh, this is an inspiring, beautifying painting thing.”
Rhi: Yeah, I like that. So, I think that you are able to talk to them and they’re like, “Hell yeah, that sounds awesome, we will totally do that as soon as the building becomes available”.
Josie: And it’s not like this is a front, they can likely use services and space and meeting rooms if they want and do this.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, cool. So, you’ve got that lined up as a way to sort of keep the Church from immediately surging in. So, yeah, I’m imaging that this scene is like, it ends with, you know, you sitting at a table while they’re all feverishly making sketches and being like, “Okay, what do we think about this? Can we incorporate this somehow?” Let’s cut over to the clinic itself, where Blaire and Seeks are scoping the place out. Blaire, how do you wanna detect ghost levels?
Kim: [laughs] I’m gonna hack into the mainframe and then—
[laughter]
Kim: No, just an Attune roll for my Gather Info, I feel like makes the most sense.
Rhi: Yes, I agree.
Kim: Okay. 2, 2, 1, 6.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: These three dice are getting banished for the rest of the game.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: I like to imagine that they’re just outside of the building, you know, scoping it out as if you were normally scoping it out in the mortal plane, but what Blaire starts doing is she puts on her spirit mask, looks into the ghost field and from a distance she can get a sense of how much spiritual activity is going on inside the location just by looking through the ghost field.
Rhi: Okay. Ghosts are just sort of a part of life in Duskwall. Even with the lightning barriers, there are ghosts all over the place.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: You know, the ghost field is a constant presence. This place is warded against ghosts so heavily the ghost field almost looks like, thinner, a little bit.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: Not so much that you’re worried that it’s gonna cause you problems, but like, it’s a little thinner in there. There are no ghosts. But on the third floor, there’s a few kind of glowing things on the third floor that you’re guessing are some kind of occult, arcane items. Tools, maybe artifacts, you’re not sure. But there is one room up on the third floor that has a lot of like, almost like neat rows of glowing light. But there’s a lot of them. And there’s also some, like, holes in the ghost field. And it reminds you a little bit of when you’ve tried to look at Setarra.
Kim: In the ghost field? Oh, okay.
Rhi: Cause demons do not have a signature in the ghost field. There’s something in that room that is also connected— that is demonic in nature.
Josie: Oh no.
Kim: Interesting.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Kim: Good to know.
Waffles: Well, that’s where they’re keeping all the blood.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Oh, they had demon blood?
Rhi: You all found some vials that you weren’t able to identify last time. Well, Seeks I think might have been able to identify that it was demon blood.
Kim: Now, with a 6 can I ask an additional question related to Gather Info?
Rhi: You sure can.
Kim: So, because this building is so heavily warded against ghosts, would I be in trouble if I tried to, like, set a ghost lose within this establishment? Like, would it go wrong or would the ghost get fucked up? Like, if I just like, busted open a jar while in this building?
Rhi: You’re not sure.
Kim: Oh, I don’t like that answer.
Rhi: Well, I will say, because like, The Nest is heavily warded against ghosts.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: But you have brought ghosts in there and opened them up and had nice conversations over tea with them.
Kim: Yeah, and everything’s fine.
Rhi: But those are wards that you set up and you know how they work.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: The wards on here are similar, but you’re not 100% sure.
Kim: And I bet they’re stronger, too.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s possible that you could bring ghosts in in jars and let them loose and it would be okay, but you’re not 100% sure.
Kim: I don’t… given that information, I don’t know if I wanna risk it. That’s helpful for me to know, though.
Waffles (as Seeks): We could smash the wards.
Kim (as Blaire): We could smash the wards. I like your thinking.
Waffles (as Seeks): I will pack extra grenades.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! And I will pack anti-ward things so we can break the wards. Yeah.
Waffles (as Seeks): Mostly you just make the symbol and then you fill it with electroplasm and then you smash the symbol and it stops working. But I don’t know.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, I think also that, and also grenades. Both work. But I think if we’re trying to sell this building that it probably shouldn’t, any portion of it probably shouldn’t be blown up, you know?
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, so we should probably do this the old-fashioned way.
Waffles (as Seeks): With acid.
Kim (as Blaire): With acid, or with the method that you suggested earlier with the electroplasm and the smashing and whatnot. My point is, my point is that this should be as neat as possible.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh, I can do neat. I have this stuff.
Waffles: And I pull out a little bottle of alcahest.
Kim: Of what?
Waffles: It is a mid-level fluid, and if you pour it on stuff that’s working, it makes it not work anymore.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh perfect. Yeah, that’ll work.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, if we can do that and pull it off successfully then I’ll totally bring some ghost friends.
Waffles (as Seeks): Ghost friends.
Kim (as Blaire): Ghost friends!
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: If we’re gonna move into the score, do you think this is Assault or Stealth? [laughs]
Josie: Uh…
Kim: I feel like Assault. I don’t think we’re being very stealthy about this, are we?
Waffles: Well, we know where the back door is and I think we should just… [laughs]
Josie: But that’s the thing, though. We want to get to Hagen as well, which may require a more covert approach.
Waffles: It can be a quiet assault.
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: Smoke, grenades and Prowl checks, here we go. [laughs]
Rhi: I think actually Assault might be the best way to go, because the description for Assault is “do violence to a target”.
Josie: Ah. Yeah, then Assault.
Kim: Oh yeah, no we’re totally killing this fucker. So yeah, that makes sense.
Rhi: Yeah. Assault plan, right?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: And you’re planning on breaking in the back?
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Mm hmm. Although there were guards there last time, so we need to be careful.
Rhi: Yeah. For the engagement roll. One for luck. “Is this operation particularly bold or daring?”
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah.
Waffles: [laughs]
Rhi: “Does the plan’s detail expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they’re weakest?” No.
Waffles: They are weak to grenades.
Kim: That is true.
Rhi: Most things are.
[laughter]
Waffles: A tragic flaw. [laughs]
Rhi: “Any of your friends or contacts provide aid or insight?”
Kim: Yeah! Seeks is here.
Rhi: Yes, but “Are enemies or rivals interfering in the operation?”
Kim: No?
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: Oh.
Waffles: Uh oh.
Rhi: “Are there other elements you want to consider?” You’ve been here before. So that’s gonna help. You are familiar with the place you’re breaking into. Okay. So, this is gonna be a 3d6 engagement roll. Okay, that is a 6.
Kim: Yay.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: So, I think that we see the river that runs between Charterhall and Coalridge, moonlight reflecting dimly on the water, as a gondola moves down towards this small dock near a bridge. And I think as the gondola pulls up next to the dock, the lamplight casts across all of you, and it is the four of you and the gondola is being pulled along by none other than Kay.
Kim: Yay.
Rhi: Because you know what? We haven’t seen her for a while.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: So, she like, stops the gondola, will give all of you a hand out onto the dock, then is like:
Rhi (as Kay): I can’t really hang around this specific spot too much, but I’ll keep heading up and down to keep an eye out for you if you need to come back out this way.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks.
Josie (as Minx): Do what you need to, dear.
Waffles (as Seeks): Thank you, gorgeous tall person.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi (as Kay): You are very welcome, beautiful short person.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Salutes and pulls away.
Waffles (as Seeks): [gasp]
Rhi: [laughs] So, you will step off onto the dock. It’s a very similar setup to when I think Minx and Seeks came this way previously. And it feels very, very similar. You know, stairs lead up into the building, there’s a light on at the top of the stairs. Last time, you saw shadows moving from people being up there. You don’t really see that kind of movement this time. And so, I think that you start up the stairs and Blaire, you are gonna be the last one up the stairs.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And as you, Blaire, start to move towards the stairs, there’s sort of a louder splash of water against the docks and then a familiar, cold voice says from behind you:
Rhi (as Setarra): I have something you need to do in there.
Kim: Blaire turns around and sees it’s Setarra.
Josie: Do the rest of us hear this?
Rhi: I’ll leave it up to you, I think, if you wanna be aware of this exchange or not.
Josie: I like to think we didn’t notice that Blaire got pulled behind, so we’re like, going up to the door and they’re having a quiet conversation.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: That’s what I’m imagining too.
Josie: Because I know that’s, like, what would happen in a TV show.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Kim: So anyway, Blaire turns around and sees it’s Setarra and is like:
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… oh, hey. Long time no see. What’s up?
Rhi (as Setarra): Yes, it has been a rather long time since you have bothered with anything important.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… okay. Um…
Rhi (as Setarra): But fortunately, this particular diversion of yours does have some interest to me.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: And she will reach, kind of, again, that sort of reaching into her dress as though there’s a pocket there, even though there’s not really. And she takes out a, like, a glass flask that is full of seawater.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh.
Rhi: And she says:
Rhi (as Setarra): The miserable wretch who runs this building has a great deal of blood of my kind hoarded. When you find it…
Rhi: And she will hand you this flask.
Rhi (as Setarra): Summon me, so that I can deal with it.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. And how do you want me to summon you?
Rhi (as Setarra): Has it been so long since you have bothered with this that you have forgotten?
Kim (as Blaire): [stammers] N- no, no, I just know that you have ways that I prefer that I do it, so I just want to make sure I do what’s most convenient for you.
Rhi (as Setarra): Use this…
Rhi: Gesturing to the flask of seawater.
Rhi (as Setarra): To call me and I will be there.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Once I get to the demon blood, call you.
Rhi (as Setarra): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Got it. I’ll see you there.
Rhi (as Setarra): Good.
Rhi: And then she just sort of dissolves into water and splashes back down through the boards of the dock.
Kim: Blaire stuffs the vial of seawater into her pocket and runs to catch up with the rest of the crew.
Rhi: Yeah. And I think you, like, catch up to the back of the group just as— who is leading the group?
Josie: I’ll be leading.
Rhi: Okay. So, Minx, you kinda get up to a point on the stairs where you can, like, just see the landing at the top. Like, just peeking over the stairs. And you see a pair of booted feet, crossed at the ankles, resting on the floor like, you know, somebody is sitting down, kinda has their legs stretched out. And as you stand there, listening, you know, over kind of the sound of the river behind you and the soft noises of your companions, you hear the gentle sound of a person snoring. The guard on this door is asleep. [laughs]
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Excellent.
Rhi: So, yeah. I mean, you’re starting in a controlled position, so you’re— things are good for you right now. So, yeah, now to be fair, four people stomping past might wake this guy up, so you might want to do something to secure him a little better, but he is currently napping.
Waffles: [laughs] Can I just stick him in the neck? Can I just drug the man?
Rhi: [laughs] Seeks can do that.
Waffles: [laughs] This is gonna get loud.
Josie: No, don’t get loud.
Waffles: And we’ve just come up from behind, so we should just drug the man. [laughs]
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: I mean, we’re not above that. If that’s what you wanna do.
Waffles: Yeah, no, I will use a use of my bandoliers.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, what drug specifically are you using?
Waffles: Probably just trance powder? But let me look at my list real quick.
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: Yeah, that would be terrifying. No, probably not. Hmm, uh, yeah. Trance powder seems like— unless I want to use binding oil to stick him to the chair.
Rhi: I mean…
Waffles: Which would be hilarious, but [laughs] no, we’re just gonna trance powder. Just, whoop.
Rhi: Okay. So, go ahead and roll. Controlled position.
Waffles: Is it a Prowl or a Tinker with Physicker?
Rhi: Um, Prowl I think.
Waffles: A 6.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, you just kinda like slip up there, jab him with a needle, the snoring gets louder. He seems to be even more asleep. He’s got keys on him. [laughs] And I think since he’s this knocked out, one of you can just…
Waffles: Take his keys, take his wallet…
Minna: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Aw, there’s pictures of his kids in here.
Waffles (as Seeks): Aw. Wait, that one’s really cute.
Kim (as Blaire): Are those twins? It looks like he has twins.
Rhi: Thank you for building all this out in the event that I need to kill this person later.
Kim: [laughs]
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh, his husband’s adorable, look at their anniversary.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww, they’re so nice!
Josie (as Minx): Dears?
Rhi: Alright.
Josie (as Minx): We do have a job to do.
Rhi: Minx makes an excellent point. Myra is able to open up the back door and you all step into the basement. It looks much as it did when Minx and Seeks were here last. It’s the kind of cramped hallways painted a sort of dingy beige. There’s a handful of doors scattered along the hallway that you are in currently. There’s kinda cheap, sort of flickery lighting illuminating the place. And yeah, as far as you can tell, you don’t hear anybody else down here, you don’t hear any movement. It seems pretty calm for now. So, what do you all wanna do?
Josie: I’m gonna use this opportunity to don my disguise for this episode.
Rhi: Which is?
Josie: Well, if you liked maid outfit, how about nurse outfit? [laughs]
[laughter]
Kim: [loudly] Yes!
Rhi: Alright.
Kim: I’m sorry in advance Rhi for that waveform.
[laughter]
Rhi: It’s okay. Okay, so I’m picturing the, like, World War II era nurse.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: The long white dresses with apron and little hat. [laughs] I’m picturing that Minx is just like, “Hold on a moment, dears,” opens a random closet door, steps inside, and in way too short a time for the amount of clothing that’s changed, steps back out in the nurse costume.
Minna: Minx has actor training.
Josie: I haven’t so much done theatre as prepared to do theatre. Wanted to do theatre. Once I have money and access. [laughs] Minx has definitely, you know, practiced for being on stage in her room.
Rhi: [laughs] That’s really cute. Alright, so what is your plan for this nurse’s uniform?
Josie: I am intending to deliver a message to the guards at Hagen’s stairway that apparently his husband is in some sort of trouble.
Minna: [soft gasp]
Rhi: Oh… interesting. Okay.
Josie: I think first I want to see— I’m going to go up a floor.
Rhi: Okay. Everybody else gonna hang back a bit?
Kim: For now, yeah.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Okay. I mean, I think if things start going bad you’ll probably be able to figure it out. Or do you set a, like, “if I don’t come back in X amount of time” type thing?
Kim: I feel like Blaire would be the one to bring that up. She’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, if you’re not back in, like, fifteen minutes, something’s gone wrong.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I will make it quick.
Kim (as Blaire): Please. And please come back.
Josie (as Minx): I will.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, you can head on upstairs. So, getting back to the first floor, also a lot of hallways with a lot of doors leading to small rooms that have numbers on them. I think as you kind of step into one of the halls it just has that kinda like… it’s not the hospital smell that we think of now, where it’s kinda that, like, antiseptic, clean smell. This, it smells like your room smells after you’ve been sick with, like, a really bad cold for a few days. Just that kinda like, gross, sick, sweaty smell.
Kim: Oh gross, yeah.
Rhi: The air here just kinda has that tinge to it. It’s pretty quiet. It’s night time, you know, for what that’s worth in this setting. But most people are sleeping. You don’t see anybody immediately when you come up onto the first floor.
Josie: Alright. What about the stairway I tried to get up last time?
Rhi: Uh, yeah. You’re able to find your way back to that. There are two guards standing at the base of the stairs and I’m gonna make a fortune roll, because on the one hand, like, you’re dressed as a nurse.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: They shouldn’t question you. But you’re also an unfamiliar face. So, I’m gonna make a fortune roll to see if— which one of those elements is gonna win out for them. Are they just gonna see the uniform and be like, “Eh, nurse, fine, supposed to be here”, or if they’re going to notice that, “Hey, I don’t recognize you.” So lemme see how this is gonna shake out. So, one of the guards just like glances at you and just doesn’t, like, there’s a glance not even so much of acknowledging you, but just sort of like “Oh, there is movement, I will look towards it.”
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Doesn’t seem phased at all. The other guard, though, kind of narrows her eyes at you a little bit. Is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Excuse me. Uh, I don’t think I’ve seen you around here before…
Josie (as Minx): Oh, yes, I’m sorry. Hi. I’m Elizabeth, I don’t usually work nights. I wasn’t expecting to work tonight either, but…
Josie: She’ll offer her hand to shake.
Rhi: And I think before that shake happens, gimme a roll.
Josie: Alright.
Rhi: You’re still in a controlled position.
Josie: 6.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so she kinda like, the suspicious look when you give that explanation of, like, “oh yeah, I got put on the night shift,” that seems to just completely win her over. She just is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, alright.
Rhi: And will shake your hand and like—
Josie (as Minx): Yes. What I also wasn’t expecting was to get the message I just got. It is rather urgent. Do you want to take it to Dr Hagen or should I?
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, um—
Josie (as Minx): Apparently, it’s regarding his husband.
Rhi (as Guard): Oh.
Josie (as Minx): I understand he’s very private, but my bedside manner, you know, it’s my job.
Rhi: She’s like:
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, um, yes. Yes. Head right on up. I think he’s in his labs on the third floor.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you.
Josie: And then I will try and go up the stairs looking like I am refraining from hurrying.
Rhi: Ah. [laughs]
Josie: I’m trying not to freak anyone out but I’m sort of a little antsy.
Rhi: Got it. Yeah, I think, like, you might hear the guards kind of whispering a little bit as you leave, but it doesn’t seem to be, like, it sounds more like gossip whispering, which you’re quite familiar with.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: And yeah, you get up onto the second floor, continue to navigate to the stairs leading up to the third floor, which last time you came here was just open. Apparently, they’ve made some changes to the security since you were here last, what with all the explosions.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: There is a wrought iron gate, kind of one of those that would slide back and forth, pulled across the stairs. And there are three guards stationed on the other side of it. One who’s kind of down at the base of the stairs, and two who are up at the top. But the guard who’s at the base of the stairs will kinda step towards the gate when you get up there and be like:
Rhi (as Guard): Did you need something?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, yes. I have a message for Dr Hagen regarding his husband. It was pretty urgent, but if you want to take it to him that’s fine also.
Rhi: Go ahead and give me a roll.
Josie: Same dealio.
Rhi: Yep.
Josie: But you know what? I really wanna get through this gate. I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: 6.
Rhi: 6, alright. So, yeah, he just kind of is like:
Rhi (as Guard): Oh. Oh. Um, alright.
Rhi: And will unlock the gate and will kinda call up to the other two, be like:
Rhi (as Guard): She says she’s got a message for the doctor, can you walk her to the lab?
Rhi: And they will nod and yeah, when you get to the top of the stairs on the third floor the two guards who are there are gonna, like, fall in step beside you and will be escorting you to wherever you need to be.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: So, back down in the basement. It hasn’t been too long. Are the three of you gonna be doing anything, preparing anything?
Kim: I want her first order of business to be finding these wards and destroying them, in the building.
Rhi: Oh okay, yeah. If you and Seeks wanna work on that.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Waffles: I also kinda wanted to check to see if the little vault that they had of blood last time, if it’s in the same place or if they moved it. Because I remember it being downstairs.
Rhi: It was. It was in the basement last time. So, the three of you kinda continue on in the basement. We’ll start with checking for the vault because that’s the easier one. Seeks, you remember pretty well where the vault was. It stood out pretty well, it was a big, heavy, steel door that, you know, I think you poured acid all over and then people threw some grenades into the room. You’re able to find the doorway again. It still has the big, heavy, steel door, but that door is just standing open. And if you look inside, the former vault room looks like it’s now being used for just sort of general storage. There’s just, like, some crates and stacks of, like, bed linens and a broom. It seems like after you all, again, threw grenades into the room full of all sorts of expensive arcane goodies, they relocated that stuff. Yeah, it’s just another— it’s a closet with a really expensive door now.
Waffles: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, do you think you could at least sense the electroplasm? Maybe it’ll be near there?
Kim (as Blaire): Um, it’s on the third floor. You might wanna ask me when we get closer to it.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I say we try and get up there if we can.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, definitely. I gotta get up there.
Rhi: And then, yeah, Seeks or Blaire or both of you together, you wanted to start trying to take down wards and stuff?
Kim: Yes please.
Waffles: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Okay. I mean, if you do this as an Attune type thing, Myra has a pretty good Attune, so she can—
Minna: Group magic is fun.
Kim: I was gonna say, let’s do a group Attune. That makes the most sense for me.
Rhi: Who’s gonna lead?
Kim: I can lead, I have no stress.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: 6, 4, 2.
Minna: 6.
Rhi: Okay, so a 6 and a 6 and…
Waffles: 4 and a 2.
Rhi: Okay. So, no stress and the result is a 6.
Kim: Yay!
Rhi: So, tell me what this looks like as the three of you are kinda working together to identify where these wards are.
Kim: I have an idea of what it looks like, but I don’t want to step on any toes here. I wanna know if you guys— if you folks know what this might look like or have any ideas.
Minna: I think you should go ahead and describe what you’re thinking.
Waffles: Yeah.
Kim: My idea is that in a group Attune action we’re all holding hands while looking into the ghost field.
Waffles: Yes!
Josie: Aww.
Kim: And with, sort of like, our energies combined in that sense, since we’re holding hands, we are able to collectively widen our range of sight into the ghost field. We can see farther than any of us individually could.
Rhi: Yeah, and I think actually I like that idea of that, like, your collective sight is extended out. And since you got a 6, it’s not just like, the first one. You’re able to see up where they are on— not just in the basement, but up onto the first and even second floors. The third floor is just a little bit outta your range. It’s sort of that— the third floor is like when you’re out driving in the country and like, there’s a city on the horizon and there’s just kinda that faint glow but you can’t pick out distinct buildings.
Kim: Mm, right.
Rhi: It’s like that. You know that there’s stuff up there, but you can’t make out any details.
Kim: I like that.
Rhi: Basement, first and second floor, you know where the wards are.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: I think that what it is, is that it’s sort of a, um, it’s like a chain that kind of encircles the whole floor of like, you know, there’s runes kind of around the entire wall. But you just have to pull out the right links in that chain to sort of defuse it.
Waffles: I’mma wreck it.
Rhi: Alright.
Waffles: I’m gonna mark arcane implements.
Rhi: Okay, to do an arcane wreck.
Waffles: And I think what this looks like is, like, we find the first of many runes and Seeks, like, looks up— I assume, are they up like where the ceiling meets the wall?
Rhi: Yeah, sure.
Waffles: Okay. Seeks looks up there and runs off, comes back with a crate and sets the crate down.
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: Climbs up and pulls out a bunch of, like, it’s pretty much putty, but it’s been mixed with weird magic stuff. And just puts it over sections of the rune, and my intent here is to inverse the rune.
Rhi: Okay.
Waffles: At least temporarily, because we can come back and remove the putty, make it attract ghosts as opposed to not attract ghosts.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. I like it.
Waffles: A 5.
Rhi: 5, okay. Yeah. This is a good time to start this. So, I’m gonna say that you’re gonna end up in a risky position. You do that and I think hop down from the crate looking satisfied, and the back door creaks open. You’re out of sight of it, you’re kind of down the hall and around a corner, so whatever has just opened the door cannot see you, but the door just opened. You are no longer alone in the basement.

##Blooper [00.48.50]

Kim (as Blaire): [gasps]
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: You know, these things happen.
Kim (as Blaire): That is true.
Minna: That’s a good idea, but it’s not [breaks down laughing]

"Season 3, Episode 9: The Divided Loyalties Score, Part 2 Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter).
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. I know for some folks funds are tight coming out of the holidays, but if you are able, consider heading to our Patreon and backing us. For just $2 a month you get access to our whole secret archive. There are entire bonus episodes in there, plus art and blog posts and deleted scenes and lots more. If you can’t do a monthly payment, check out our Shapeways store for a Magpies pin, currently the only official Magpies merch available. It’s very exclusive and very neat. If you can’t do financial support, then leave us a review or talk us up on Twitter. We love all the support we get from all of you.
A few notes about this episode. First, it is an emotionally intense one overall. People end up in very dangerous situations and there’s some pretty intense inter-party conflict. Also, Setarra is around, so her relationship with Blaire comes into play again at a few points. It’s all mixed into the episode so I can’t give specific timestamps for scenes to skip. If this doesn’t sound like something you can listen to, there is a summary on the episode page on MagpiesPodcast.net and there will be a link to that specific page in the show notes.
In nine days, the Kickstarter for Descent into Midnight goes live. Descent into Midnight is a Powered by the Apocalypse game about hope and community, about corruption and despair, all set in an aquatic alien world of psionics and biotechnology. I have been in games where people have played such characters as a globe-spanning plankton hivemind, a trans-dimensional whale, and an iridesce-ing dancing creature of tendrils and light. Every game I’ve played has been incredibly creative and deeply emotional. I’m the accessibility consultant on the project and I am truly honored to be involved in it. Check the link in the episode description to subscribe to the Kickstarter page so you can be notified as soon as it goes live. You’re not gonna wanna miss this. Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s featured charities.
Kim: There’s a lot of misinformation circulating around the Coronavirus outbreak right now, but I think one thing that’s definitely true is that doctors and hospitals are rapidly running out of supplies. I wanted to feature a way to help Wuhan this month because the outbreak is absolutely a crisis in China right now, and I haven’t seen any charities or fundraisers boosted, or seen any way at all people outside of China can help. In my research, I found a GoFundMe page to raise money for medical supplies to send to Wuhan. I believe it to be legitimate, the page has been organized by the Canadian Society for Virology, Dalhousie University and other members of the Canadian medical community. The money being raised will be going to purchasing and sending supplies like protective suits, masks, goggles, etc to hospitals in need over in China. As of this recording they’ve raised nearly $23,000 out of a $50,000 goal and I think it would be a great cause to give to.
I’m not sure how these organizers will be ensuring that these supplies will actually reach the hospitals that need them and I understand if you feel wary about giving to a cause like this at this time. If you feel at all apprehensive, I encourage our US listeners to simply donate to your presidential and/or senatorial candidates instead. If you’re in a red state and there’s a candidate for senate that’s challenging your current representative, I am actually begging you to donate to them, support them and vote for them, because I want as many of these 51 traitors out of a job as we possibly can. Please, please, please, please do that for me. And for those of us in blue states who already have democratic representatives, or if you live in a state where your senator isn’t up for re-election, I encourage you to find your own ways to pitch in and help turn the tide in November. Thank you.
Rhi: The political news recently has been bleak and it can be very hard to keep fighting and hoping. If you can’t manage to be hopeful, and sometimes, I can’t – I’m sure that other people have probably felt the same – there’s always spite. These people in power, these hateful, greedy, corrupt people, they want us to stop fighting. They want us to lay down so that it is easier for them to grind us under their heels, and fuck them. Keep fighting. If for no other reason than to make their lives difficult, even a little bit. Continue to do what you can, donate money, call, write letters. Voter registration is going to be critically important this year, so look for places in your community where you can help. They’re out there. There’s so many causes that need you. Especially now.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [0.05.34]
Rhi: The back door creaks open. You’re out of sight of it, you’re kind of down the hall and around a corner, so whatever has just opened the door cannot see you, but the door just opened. You are no longer alone in the basement.
Minna: [whines]
Josie: [grumbles]
Rhi: And I think we’re gonna cut back upstairs.
Josie: Cool. [laughs] Awesome.
Rhi: Yeah. So, you are being escorted down a hall by these two guards, and the difference between the lower levels of the clinic and this level is pretty stark. The rest of the clinic has been, like, it’s cheap. Kinda cracked, dingy paint, the lighting is, you know, pretty weak. Not a lot has been invested in, sort of, structurally, those levels. Up here though, the walls are painted a very, like, nice, rich green. The floors are still, I think, basically concrete, but they have nice rugs laid out on them. It’s just a nicer space to be in.
Even with that, though, it’s still unsettling. Maybe even more unsettling because of the contrast in how this place looks and what you’re getting from the rest of your senses. That sort of sickly smell that you noticed downstairs is gone and it’s replaced with… it’s the same way that the air kinda smells when you’re near the lightning barriers. It just kinda has that sort of, like, electric tinge to it. It’s mostly quiet. There’s some occasionally kinda pained moans that you can hear, sort of muffled and distant. And at one point you hear a sudden, sharp scream that cuts off very abruptly.
Josie: Oh dear. Minx is gonna try and keep her composure.
Rhi: Yeah. You know, I almost wanna have you roll resistance to keep your composure.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Because this is something that, like, Minx has been shaken up and startled by this sort of thing before. So I’m gonna say, yeah, roll Resolve to see if you can maintain your cool, because you work here. You’re supposed to be used to this sort of thing.
Josie: Right. 4, 4, 4.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] So in exchange for two points of stress, you can keep your composure.
Josie: I think I’m gonna look freaked out and deal with the consequences.
Rhi: Okay. I think one of the guards kind of side-eyes you and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): What’s the matter?
Josie (as Minx): Nothing. Nothing. It’s just— not used to the night shift.
Rhi (as Guard): Hmph. You must not be used to the third floor.
Josie (as Minx): That either. I’m not up here often.
Rhi (as Guard): Well, it doesn’t usually have much need for the nursing staff up on this level, anyway.
Rhi: And they, like, turn a corner and there’s a, you know, large, wooden door that one of the guards will knock on. There’s a muffled:
Rhi: (as Voice): Just a moment.
Rhi: From inside. And then after a few moments, the door opens and Dr Hagen is standing there. He’s Akorosi, pale skin, dark hair that’s kind of starting to thin, I think. And looks like he’s probably in his mid-50s or so. And he is wearing, you know, like one of those leather smocks that— well, none of the bloodstains on it are fresh, at least.
Josie: Uh huh…
Rhi: He glances at the guards and then looks at you and is like:
Rhi (as Dr Hagen): I don’t believe we’ve met.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, pardon me, Doctor. I’m Elizabeth. Um, I’m not usually working nights.
Josie: I won’t offer my hand, instead I’ll just sort of gently bow a little bit.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Pardon the interruption, but I just received a distressing message regarding your husband.
Rhi: He kind of, like, his eyes widen a little bit and is like:
Rhi (as Dr Hagen): Yes, what is it?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, well, the page was rather frazzled, but it appears he may have had a heart attack. Just judging by the symptoms described.
Rhi: Gimme a roll. [laughs]
Josie: Uh huh. Um… do I wanna push myself here? What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi and Minna: Ooh!
Rhi: Where are you trying to get him to go? Cause your friends are all down in the basement.
Josie: Right. I am trying to get him to go home and I have a plan for that.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: But I need to see if he takes the bait first.
Rhi: Okay. Uh, I think for lack of better options, I’m gonna say that just sort of the, like, stress of this whole situation, of being in this place and not knowing what’s going on is somehow worse than knowing, that you’re gonna take level 1 harm, Exhaustion, basically.
Josie: I think I will do that.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you’re just, you yourself are becoming a little frazzled. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah. But I do get that die. 6.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, he, like, swears under his breath and is like:
Rhi (as Dr Hagen): Alright, did they say where he is? Was he at his office?
Josie (as Minx): I believe he had just arrived home.
Rhi (as Dr Hagen): Alright. Uh—
Josie (as Minx): I’ve summoned a carriage if you need it.
Rhi (as Dr Hagen): Good, thank you.
Rhi: And he like, you know, starts kind of unlacing the back of the smock and is like:
Rhi (as Dr Hagen): I’ll need the three of you to lock up in here. I will— I have to get going.
Josie: As you wish.
Josie: Now I kinda wanna do a flashback here.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I want to have paid a Cabbie friend of ours to have shown up, to show up to be the carriage.
Rhi: Uh huh.
Josie: And then have it take him on a ride.
Rhi: Oh. [laughs]
Josie: And end up somewhere secluded.
Kim: Mm…
Rhi: So, just take him, got it, take him somewhere.
Josie: Like, get him out, take him on a ride, and then we can meet up with the Cabbie friend to off him somewhere secluded he doesn’t know.
Rhi: Okay. Everybody else cool with that plan?
Kim: Yeah, that totally works.
Minna: Yes, I love it.
Waffles: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, and I mean, it’s like— great, so yeah, I think he, you know, kind of rushes back inside and is grabbing his coat and stuff, and the guards kind of look to you expectantly as if you are supposed to lead the way into this lab, as he did ask you to lock up in here.
Josie: Yeah. Yeah, I’ll do what they expect.
Rhi: Alright. Well, we’ll see, because you’re gonna have to figure this out. So, you step into this room and it’s a very well-lit, clean lab. There’s counters with lots of beakers and vials of various colored liquid. There’s some stuff that kind of from talking to Blaire you recognize as, like, alchemical things. That doesn’t really hold your attention quite as much as the cages in the back of the room.
Josie: The cages.
Rhi: There are cages. There are four of them. One is empty.
Kim: Mom, pick me up, I’m scared.
[laughter]
Rhi: Each of them contains basically, like, a chamber pot and a cot and that’s it. And then there is a person—
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: —standing in each cage. Vacant eyes, slack-jawed, kind of standing there limp. They don’t react when you come in, and there is a fourth person kind of strapped down to an operating table, basically.
Kim: What…?
Rhi: And Minx, you’ve spent your whole life in Duskwall. You have heard of these things. Maybe not ever encountered them, but you have heard stories about things that are called hollows. They are the opposite of a ghost, you could think of it. A ghost is a spirit without a body, a hollow is a body without a spirit. They are alive, but they do not have a soul anymore.
Josie: Oh heavens.
Rhi: And Hagen rushes out of the room, leaving you and these two guards to deal with the hollow that is just strapped to this bed, staring dead-eyed up at the ceiling.
Josie: Mm hmm. And I can imagine that’s the only thing he wants locked up here.
Rhi: You’re guessing.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. And so I think— man, I just keep creating cliffhangers here tonight, we’re gonna leave Minx in that situation with two guards standing behind her expecting her to know what to do here, and head back down to the basement, where the three of you have started breaking up some of these wards and the back door just opened.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: And what do you wanna do about that?
Minna: Hide?
Kim: Probably hide.
Waffles: Yeah, probably hide.
Rhi: That sounds like probably, do you all wanna do, like, a group something?
Kim: A group something sounds great.
Waffles: A group something.
Kim: Would it be a group Prowl to hide?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Alright, who is gonna lead it?
Waffles: I can lead a Prowl. I’m here for one session and have none of the stress.
Rhi: [laughs] Alright, yeah, everybody go ahead and make those rolls. This is risky.
Kim: It’s a 4 and a 3 from me.
Waffles: 6!
Minna: 6 as well.
Rhi: Okay, so result is a 6. So, you all, I think, go back to that vault room, because there’s a lot of, like, crates and stuff and that door is open, so you don’t have to worry about it making noise. You all duck back in there. And I think, Myra, you’re the one with the line of sight to the door. You’re, like, peeking over the top of a crate and you see— you hear the footsteps first. They’re heavy and metallic. And then, you see, initially because of the poor lighting you think it’s a person just walking by, but then they step into the light a little better, and the light is glinting off of a humanoid figure that appears to be made entirely of brass.
Minna: Mm!
Rhi: And it is slowly stalking the hall, head swiveling back and forth. It doesn’t seem to notice you in this vault, and it goes past. You can kinda hear the footsteps continuing down the hall. What are you gonna do?
Minna: Um…what are we gonna do? God, what do you do with a hull stalking down a hallway and you’re hiding from them?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: This is just that Jurassic park scene with the raptor in the kitchen.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Pretty much.
Rhi: Mm hmm, yeah.
Waffles: I’m going to stage whisper:
Waffles (as Seeks): Do we blow it up?
Kim (as Blaire): [whispers] I don’t think that’s a good idea.
Waffles: I put the thing of, just a comical clock around TNT, back into the bag. [laughs]
[laughter]
Rhi: Alright, so explosions have been vetoed for the moment. You can hear, like, now that you know what to listen for, you can hear it kind of pacing around out there and starting to open doors.
Minna: Ah.
Kim: I don’t like this at all.
Waffles: Let’s see… what cool tools do we have?
Kim: I don’t know what tools would be useful, honestly.
Waffles: I got fine wrecking tools, uh… I’ve got an electroplasm battery in this. We could probably short-circuit it.
Minna: Yes!
Waffles: We just have to pry it open.
Kim: That’s not a bad idea.
Minna: Let’s set up an ambush by the door.
Rhi: I think I’ll need some kind of roll for the effectiveness of this ambush.
Waffles: Group Prowl.
Rhi: To see how well you all hide.
Minna: Yeah, probably another Prowl.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I can lead this time, if you want.
Kim: Okay.
Waffles: Alright. Got a 6.
Rhi: Good lord.
Kim: 2 and a 6.
Rhi: Okay. Okay, so result is a 6, Waffles you’re gonna take— or Minna, you’re gonna take one point of stress, because Myra was leading that one. You all, like, find places to crouch down and hide. You hear the footsteps coming back, pause, door opens, footsteps coming closer, pause, door opens, footsteps get even closer, and then the door to the room you’re in swings open. It’s, you know, the vault that you’re in is— the lights are off in here, so it’s just silhouetted from behind. And Myra, there’s something about the way that it’s standing and looking around the room that it, like, niggles at the back of your mind.
Minna: Oh no!
Rhi: It feels familiar but you can’t quite place it. And it comes into the room, kind of into whatever— it hits the mark of, like, ambush time! And yeah, who’s gonna do what?
Waffles: I’mma Wreck it.
Rhi: Okay.
Waffles: I’ve got these fine wrecking tools.
Rhi: Okay.
Waffles: I’ll go ahead and push myself.
Rhi: Okay. Is this gonna be— so you’re coming up on it at close range, hand to hand?
Waffles: Yeah, I think what this looks like is I have attached some manner of, like, metal prod to the end of the battery and I’m just gonna try and get it up under its metal carapace and just poke it where the wires are.
Rhi: Okay. It’s reduced effect and, since you’re engaging it at close range, desperate.
Waffles: Alright, so I’m gonna push myself to get better effect and do my fine wrecking tools do anything there, or are they already applied?
Rhi: No, actually, no. So, for you it would be desperate, standard effect, with the fine wrecking tools. I forgot about that.
Waffles: Alright. Then I will push myself for even better effect. 5s.
Rhi: All of them?
Waffles: Yep.
Rhi and Waffles: [laugh]
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Alright. So, Seeks, describe what this looks like as you lunge in.
Waffles: Yeah, I think Seeks just comes up from below, out of the darkness, with, like, it looks like an electrical baton, and just shoves it. I imagine it’s got, like, a barrel chest where its armored but there’s, like, a bunch of wiring underneath. And just sticks it in its torso and we just see a flash of electroplasm light that comes out of all the cracks and then it just starts smoking.
Rhi: Okay. It’s not— you didn’t take it out.
Waffles: Okay.
Rhi: [laughs] So like, that happens, it is smoking, it is harmed, but you haven’t dealt with it entirely. Because you got a 5, like, as you do that one of the arms— the shoulder twists back in a way that a human’s can’t, like, the muscles just don’t allow it. But it just rotates fully around, and as it does that a blade shoots out of the arm and just stabs you.
Kim: Oh no!
Rhi: Level 3 harm.
Waffles: I’m gonna mark armor.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] That will reduce it to level 2.
Waffles: Can I roll to resist?
Rhi: Yeah.
Waffles: 3. So I take three stress.
Rhi: Okay. Three stress and that’ll knock it down to a 1. So, I think it’s like, this blow that would have, you know, gutted you, instead it’s partially deadened by the armor and then you manage to twist so instead of this going, like, straight through your stomach, it’s a shallow gash along your ribs. Yeah, so it is kind of still, like, twitching and sparking and smoking a bit and as it turns, another blade snaps out of its other arm.
Kim: What?
Waffles: There’s this brief moment where Seeks goes from “I did it!” to “Oh gosh, no”. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. Myra? Blaire?
Minna: Uh….
Kim: Blaire’s just screaming.
Minna and Waffles: [laugh]
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] Blaire is valid. Myra?
Kim and Waffles: [laugh]
Minna: Um, is there anything I could tell that looks like… I don’t know. What do I know about hulls?
Rhi: You know that hulls are mechanical creations that are powered by a spirit. They are sparkcraft creations with a spirit powering them. So, there is something in a hull that has a spirit, a human spirit, in it. They don’t really have a lot of, like, independent will of their own. They are given an order and they will carry it out to the best of their ability. You don’t know what this thing’s orders are. The hulls you dealt with previously were horse-like hulls and they’re order was “go”, so that was pretty simple. But hulls can be given more complex commands. But you’re not sure what this one’s is. You don’t know if it’s here to, like, look for you specifically.
Minna: Well, it was pretty clearly searching for something earlier. And, you know, it’s not a hard leap to guess that at least it’s looking for the intruders here. Do I know if there’s a way to, like, release the spirit or stop it or anything? Is there something I can roll?
Rhi: No. You would not know that off the top of your head.
Minna: Okay, that’s fair.
Rhi: No, this was not Myra’s area of study. Blaire might not even know this.
Kim: Really?
Rhi: I don’t know how much Blaire has really looked into hulls.
Josie: Hulls are a hull ‘nother thing?
Kim and Minna: [laugh]
Rhi: My life is suffering.
Kim: I feel like she probably only knows the basics and that’s really it, if I’m being honest.
Rhi: Yeah. This is not something that Blaire would ever want to do.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: She would never want to create a hull.
Minna: This is gonna end poorly, but I’m gonna jump on it and try and pull off the head.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: I like where your— I like this. It’s desperate, reduced effect. Go for it!
Kim: I like where your head’s at?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I didn’t say it, I stopped myself.
Minna: I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: For effect.
Rhi: Okay, so desperate, standard effect.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: 5. Okay.
Minna: So, I’m probably gonna take harm.
Rhi: Oh, yeah. Again, I don’t think you manage to get the— you don’t get its head off, but you do, like—
Waffles: Oh, I have a horrifying suggestion.
Rhi: For?
Kim: Go on?
Minna: Yes?
Waffles: She does get the head off and it doesn’t matter. [laughs]
Minna: Yes!
Rhi: Actually, hang on, let me look at my notes, let me look at my notes.
Waffles: [laughs]
Rhi: Yes, actually, that’s what happens.
Minna: Yes!
Rhi: Thanks for reminding me to check my notes, Waffles.
Kim: Mom, please pick me up, I’m scared.
Waffles: [laughs]
Rhi: You tear the head of this thing off and there’s sparks and a bit more smoke, and you’re like “Ha! I got it!” and then again, both arms circle back around and stab into your back.
Minna: Ah!
Rhi: Level 3 harm.
Minna: Level 3?!
Rhi: Level 3, this is a desperate position. And you hear, not from the head, you’re not sure where it’s coming from, maybe its through the ghost field, but you hear a tinny, echoey, but familiar voice say:
Rhi (as Hull): So nice to see you again, Myra.
Minna: Fuck!
Rhi: And it is Ojal’s voice.
Kim: What the fuck?
Rhi: Ojal was previously seen being hurled off of a speeding carriage into the path of a pursuing Bluecoat wagon.
Kim: Oh no! Oh shit!
Rhi: After trying to kill Myra in the season 2 finale.
Josie: Uh oh.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Okay. So, Myra—
Rhi: Her fate was unclear, and now it is clear.
Minna: So, Myra freezes, her arms looked in place around this hull’s shoulders.
Minna (as Myra): Ojal…
Rhi: Also, you’ve been very badly stabbed, I don’t know if you wanna resist that harm.
Minna: I do wanna resist. I think I actually wanna use armor, maybe?
Rhi: Okay. Mark two and that’ll know it down to level 2 harm.
Minna: I’m marking it as stabbed in back?
Rhi: Yes. And I think that, like, as the knives retract it grabs you and kinda like does that throwing you up and over where its head was. And like, that doesn’t do additional harm, you kind of hit the ground but manage to mostly catch yourself, so you’re no longer on it. And I think at this point all three of you hear this voice coming through the ghost field that just says:
Rhi (as Ojal): Salia sends her regards.
Waffles (as Seeks): Who?
Kim: Can Blaire be crying and also screaming now?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Crying is a free action.
[laughter]
Kim: In that case, Blaire is also crying on top of screaming.
Rhi: [laughs] Blaire hates everything about this. Let’s go back upstairs to Minx. Minx, how ya doin? How’s life?
Josie: Um, well. Real quick.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Um, is the sound of screaming heard?
Rhi: No…
Josie: There’s a lot of floors.
Rhi: There’s, yeah, screaming is in the basement, you’re on the third floor, and I don’t think Blaire can project quite that much.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Waffles: Also, this place was designed with screaming in mind.
Kim: I think it definitely was.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: I think if definitely was, now that you bring it up.
Rhi: Mm hmm. Yeah, so no, you don’t hear screaming.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. The guards are both looking at you expectantly.
Josie: I’m trying to rationalize what I can get away with in the span of an action. Um…
Rhi: Yah, well tell me what you’re thinking.
Josie: Alright. I want to somehow cast off my disguise, granting me the initiative.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Josie: And do something— alright, what I’m thinking is I just sort of sigh a little bit and just sort of move to adjust my hat, but then I toss the hat off, take a step back between the two of them and try to do that thing in movies where you just smash the bad guys’ heads together?
Rhi: Oh yeah, you can absolutely try and do that.
Josie: Okay. Yeah, I wanna do that. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] I like throwing the hat off a lot better than what I was picturing—
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Was that Minx just had a tearaway nurse costume. [laughs]
Josie: I mean…
Rhi: I don’t think that makes sense, but…
Josie: No.
Rhi: Yeah. So, you can definitely give that a shot.
Josie: What are my position and effect on this thing?
Rhi: Hoo, that is a good question. I mean, two to one… are you doing this unarmed?
Josie: Uh… I mean, yeah, for now.
Rhi: Okay. You know what, there’s only two of them, that’s not terrible, so it’s gonna be risky. It is gonna be reduced effect, because they are guards that are kind of trained to deal with people attacking them.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: Risky, reduced effect.
Josie: Well, what if I push myself and use Not To Be Trifled With to make it so I can engage multiple opponents without reduced effect?
Rhi: Uh, yeah. You will get pushed up to standard effect automatically because of the “engage a small gang on equal footing” element.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: So, you can take it as the plus one die.
Josie: Although I kinda wanna push it up to greater effect.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it.
Josie: [laughs] I got a 6.
Rhi: Good lord. But everything else was really terrible on that roll. Okay.
Josie: For the audience’s reference, I have four dots in both Skirmish and Sway and that’s what I’ve been rolling tonight, so.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so I think on great effect, yeah, you just whip around and they kind of like are looking at the hat like, “Wha…?” and then just pow! Knock their heads together. They both crumple to the floor, maybe unconscious, maybe just dazed, but they’re not in a position to stop you. The hollows don’t react at all. But yeah, you can make an exit.
Josie: Can I take one of their keys first?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Cool.
Rhi: You take off. Are you— well, what is the manner of your exit? Are you walking, are you running?
Josie: See, that’s the thing, because I don’t know how to get past the gate and back down safely without the two of them accompanying me.
Rhi: There’s only one guard left on the gate.
Josie: In that case I’m just gonna try and get out as quick as possible.
Rhi: Okay. I think that the guard who was down by the gate probably hears you running and will, like, turn around and kinda be halfway up the stairs when you get there and they’re like:
Rhi (as Guard): What’s going on?
Josie (as Minx): I don’t know. Some of them just went berserk. I didn’t know they could do that.
Rhi (as Guard): Wait, what went berserk?
Josie (as Minx): The… some of the hollows. I don’t know, I’ve never seen its like before.
Rhi: Gimme a roll.
Josie: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: Still gonna be risky.
Josie: And I don’t have the stress to be pushing myself right now, so— actually, what does a Devil’s Bargain look like here?
Rhi: The key that you need to get through this gate, for some reason is not on the keyring that you grabbed off this guard. For some reason, maybe he dropped it, maybe he never had it, he just doesn’t have the key that you need. That’s the bargain.
Josie: Yeah. I think I can take that.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: 6.
Rhi: [laughs] Good God.
Kim: Some nights, the dice are on our side.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): I did not sign up for them to strike back, they’re not supposed to do anything. It’s supposed to be warded up here.
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, oh, uh, okay.
Rhi: And I think he’s gonna start running up the stairs, like:
Rhi (as Guard): Wait here, I’m gonna go see what’s going on.
Josie (as Minx): Okay.
Rhi: And he’s gonna start running down the hall to go investigate.
Josie: Is he shutting the gate behind him?
Rhi: He’s on the same side as you.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: So you two— like, the gate is still closed. He’s just running off down the hall to go investigate.
Josie (as Minx): As he’s running off, can I like, make a pickpocket attempt to just sort of… hyup?
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] You can try.
Josie: That’s like a Prowl or something, right?
Rhi: Um…
Josie: Or is it, like…
Kim: Could be Finesse too, I feel like.
Rhi: Probably Finesse.
Josie: Okay. I’m gonna give it a shot.
Rhi: Okay. Still gonna be risky. If you get a 6…
Josie: 5.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] I was gonna throw my Blades in the Dark book across the room.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: You do it, but there’s a consequence. So, you get the keys, you just lift them off his belt, but they jingle jangle as you’re doing that and he hears it and spins around and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): What are you doing?
Josie (as Minx): W—well…
Josie: So, I’m just like:
Josie (as Minx): Well, you see, I—
Josie: Trance powder to the face. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, go ahead and roll that.
Josie: Only got a four on that one.
Rhi: Oh no. I mean, it was about time.
Josie: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay, so that was still risky. You do it, but there’s a consequence.
Josie: Maybe since he’s really close, like, I’m not able to get out immediately because I kinda have to shake off some backlash?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. I like that. Yeah, you don’t get, like, a full dose of it, but you are a little woozy and I think have to, like, sit down and put your head between your knees and take deep breaths for a little bit before you’re able to move on. Yeah, so you’re just like “Ooh,” but he ends up, kinda like, sliding down to just sit on the floor and is just sorta staring vacantly off into space. You eventually are able to— I think what it is, is that the kind of complication there is…
Josie: Well, I was thinking it’s like, I take longer, I take much longer to get down to my friends?
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, yeah, so you are gonna, yeah. You’re slowed. So, we will leave Minx sitting on the stairs and head back down to the basement. Seeks is bleeding slightly. Myra is bleeding more significantly. Blaire is still having a bit of a screaming fit.
Kim: Screaming, crying, panic attack, whatever you wanna call it. She’s just having a bad time.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s a very bad time. Would you, to calm, to have Blaire kind of calm herself down and put all those feelings in a box where they will hurt her later…
Kim: [laughs] Like a true Jedi would.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: You can, similarly to what we had Minx do previously, you can roll Resolve to have Blaire kinda get herself under control and be able to start acting again against this thing.
Kim: That works for me because I actually have a full four in Resolve. So, yeah. This might be successful despite what I actually want to happen. I want Blaire to be freaked out for the rest of the night, [laughs], but…
Rhi: I mean, she can still be freaked out, but, like…
Kim: Focused freaked out? I dunno.
Rhi: Focused, yeah.
Kim: Whatever. I’ll still roll Resolve, I don’t care.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it.
Kim: Uh, 4, 2, 3, 6.
Rhi: 6. Okay, so you can do it and take no stress.
Kim: I’m curious to know what this looks like, because I feel like Blaire can’t really compartmentalize right now. She can’t really— her friend got stabbed, both of her friends present right now have been stabbed, and one of them is in the hands of a murder robot of someone that we killed, and it’s just a bad time. She’s scared and sad and freaking out, so…
Rhi: Yeah. You don’t have to. Or if you’d like, you can kind of— I will let you sort of bank this. I think we’ve done this previously where like, you’ve got this resistance banked, so like if you want to have Blaire resist it later you can do that, but if you want her to still be very distraught right now, I’m okay with that.
Kim: I think that’s kind of how I wanna do that, and just bring up this resistance when I need her to actually focus. But right now she’s just kinda freaking out.
Rhi: Yeah, she’s not at a point where she can…
Kim: I feel like that just makes the most sense to me, honestly.
Rhi: Yeah, no. I am—listen. One of the key themes of Blades in the Dark is making decisions that are terrible for your character but good for the story, so I support this 100%.
[laughter]
Kim: Isn’t that just my whole character? [laughs]
Rhi: It’s a lot of, I mean… Minna is also kinda the patron saint of “Can I have a Devil’s Bargain? I have an idea for the horrible thing you can do to me!”
Minna: I already have an idea for the next Devil’s Bargain I ask for.
Rhi: Great! [laughs]
Kim: Minna!
[laughter]
Kim: No!
Rhi: Excellent.
Kim: Minna, you’re dying! Stop!
Rhi: She’s fine.
Kim: Is she?!
Rhi: Yeah, so Seeks and/or Myra, what do you wanna do?
Waffles: I have an idea that doesn’t involve hand grenades, surprising enough.
Minna and Rhi: It doesn’t?
Waffles: I was looking through my many, many alchemical concoctions and I have binding oil.
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: Mm.
Waffles: And I wanna pour a bottle of binding oil into its chassis and then its gears won’t move.
Rhi: Huh.
Waffles: That’s my plan.
Rhi: Okay.
Waffles: What do I— is this a Wreck? This sounds like a Wreck.
Rhi: That sound like a Wreck. I think it’s still gonna be desperate.
Waffles: Alright.
Rhi: What is the effect level on that gonna be? Man, lemme think about this. Hang on, lemme…
Waffles: Binding oil is Tier III. Permanently fuses two surfaces until dissolved by alcahest or electroplasm.
Rhi: Oh, that’s interesting. Okay. So it’s Tier III, but you’re pouring it into an electroplasmically powered creation.
Waffles: Yeah. I’m hoping, like, that are tubes? I don’t know. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. So, I’m looking at the tiers on a hull, and they are much higher than Tier III, so it’s still gonna be reduced effect, unfortunately.
Waffles: Okey dokey.
Rhi: Specifically, like, it actually has the inner gears and systems that allow the Hull to move, the clockwork actuators, that’s a Tier IV, so…
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: Yeah. So there’s a chance it’ll work, but it’ll be desperate and reduced effect.
Waffles: Do my fine wrecking tools apply? I have a needle thing that could be in there. The fanciest of spray bottles.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: Yeah, I will allow that to apply. I can push it up to standard effect with the wrecking tools. Yeah, go ahead. So, yeah, desperate, standard effect.
Waffles: Huh.
Rhi: Ooh. I don’t— that’s not a good sound.
Waffles: Right. So, what’s a number less than 4…
Kim: Oh no!
Waffles: And less than 3…
Rhi: Ooh, 2?
Waffles: And less than 1?
Minna: [laughs]
Waffles: Because I rolled three 1s.
[shouting and laughter]
Kim: No!
Rhi: You rolled three 1s?! Oh…
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh Seeks, honey…
Kim: No! [laughs]
Rhi: Oh no, okay. Well…
Kim: Why did things go bad so quick?
Minna: Because we rolled well so early.
Rhi: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. You rolled out all the 6s.
Kim: Well, to be fair, Josie took most of them. She hogged the 6s.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Josie: Sorry.
Minna: I did roll two as well when I really shouldn’t have.
Rhi: Oh, I feel bad doing this to our guest, but, like… you got a 1.
Waffles: No, I got three 1s.
Rhi: On a desperate. You got so many 1s.
Waffles: Yeah, this is fate.
Rhi: You don’t even get up to, like, close enough to spray it. It runs you through. It’s gonna be level 4 harm.
Minna and Kim: [gasp]
Josie: [exhales]
Waffles: Well, gonna have to resist that real quick.
Kim: Oh my God!
Rhi: Yep.
Josie: Oh God.
Kim: Waffles, don’t die.
Rhi: Well.
Waffles: I’m in.
Rhi: They’re rolling to resist, so they’re not going to.
Waffles: Yeah, no, I’m not gonna die. I’m just gonna max out my stress bar. I can take no more stress. And I’m gonna take level 3 harm, stabbed through the chest.
Kim: But!
Josie: Wait—
Rhi: How much, what did you roll on your resistance?
Kim: [freaking out]
Waffles: 2.
Rhi: Really?
Waffles: Yep. So, I take 4 stress, will max out that bar.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Oh my God!
Rhi: Yeah…
Josie: So that’s a trauma.
Kim: Does this mean Seeks takes a trauma and is out?
Minna: I mean, she’d already be out because level 3 harm is “need help”.
Waffles: Yeah, I can do nothing without help. But that’s okay.
Rhi: But she’s alive. We will— so, I’m gonna implement the same rules that we did for Minx, where even though she had taken trauma she came back into the score. Seeks probably can’t do a lot, because she has taken level 3 harm and cannot act without assistance. And she can’t take any actions that would cost stress. But she’s still here. Seeks is very badly injured.
Waffles: [short gurgle]
Rhi: Myra and/or— yeah— oh no, is that the noise?
Waffles: Yup.
Minna: Can I steal a grenade from Seeks?
Rhi: Um, I mean, yeah. I think Seeks will probably allow that.
Waffles: Yeah, no.
Rhi: It’s probably not stealing.
Minna: Oh no, I just meant can I take one and use it? Is that going to fuck things up mechanically?
Rhi: No, I’ve allowed you all to swap equipment like that before, I’m fine with it.
Waffles: I’ve already marked them on my load, so I have—
Minna: Yeah. I think Myra kinda bends over Seeks and she kinda like is trying to be gentle, but also they have a lot to deal with, and is like:
Minna (as Myra): Seeks? Can I— do you have a grenade handy?
Waffles: Pulls up hem of dress. Grenades.
[laughter]
Kim: Yep.
Minna: She just, she takes one and she turns and runs at Ojal.
Kim (as Blaire): What the fuck! What is happening?
Rhi: Okay, what was your plan here?
Minna: Huh?
Josie: Shove it down her neck hole.
Minna: Hopefully to shove Ojal out the door and then shove a grenade down the neck hole.
Rhi: Okay, so [laughs] get back to that plan, I like it.
Minna: For the listeners, this is Waffles’ plan, not mine. I can’t take credit.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: It’s gonna be desperate and reduced effect. Unless you wanna do something to change.
Minna: Um, I would like a Devil’s Bargain.
Kim: Minna.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh man.
Kim: Minna!
Rhi: Ojal, in one form or another, is going to make it out of this and get back to Salia.
Minna: Oh, fuck yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: I want that.
Kim: Minna!
Waffles: We were planning on that from the beginning.
Rhi: Just wanna be sure. I mean, this means that also, like, Blaire can’t get her in a spirit jar or anything, like, even if you destroy the stuff. Are you using— do you wanna use that for an extra die or for increased effect?
Minna: For increased effect.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Ah, fuck me.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Minna: It’s a 2.
Rhi: Oh boy.
Kim: I hate tonight. I hate it.
Waffles: [laughs]
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: Um…
Minna: [whines]
Kim: We were supposed to do good tonight.
Rhi: Where did you get that idea?
Kim: I had a feeling since we would have a friend that tonight would go well.
Rhi: Well…
Waffles: Listen, it was all going well until the terminator showed up.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: This is true.
Rhi: I think it’s basically the same thing. You charge it and it whips, like, faster than a human can move, it whips its arms out. And I think Seeks got run through, you almost get cut in half, and are also gonna take level 4 harm.
Minna: Okay, well I’m definitely resisting that.
Josie: Uh huh.
Kim: What the fuck!
Rhi: Have you used your armor yet? Yeah, you have used it.
Minna: I have. Wait, I haven’t actually used that much… I could take heavy and max out my gear. I haven’t used any of my own gear yet.
Rhi: You are welcome to do that.
Minna: I’m only three away from a trauma. I don’t want to immediately leave Blaire alone.
Kim: I mean, I’m not against that if that’s what you wanna do. [laughs] Blaire can be alone and be having a bad time.
Minna: Let’s risk it, let’s risk it. We’re living dangerous lives.
Kim: Oh my God!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, do it.
Kim: Alright. I like it. I’m scared, but I like it.
Minna: Fuck yes, I got a 5. So, I only take one stress.
Rhi: You take one point of stress, but you are still at level 3 harm, so.
Minna: Uh, that’s true.
Rhi: Seeks and Myra are both almost, like, side-by-side, crumpled and bleeding heavily.
Kim: You can just say dying.
Rhi: They’re not dying. They’re just…
Kim: They’re dying.
Rhi: In extr— they’re dying, yeah.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Blaire.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: You have that resistance roll banked to calm down, or at least pull yourself together enough to act. You were also given a way to summon a demon.
Kim: This is true.
Rhi: Just wanna remind you, you have that. This is not where you were supposed to do that thing.
Josie: Yeah, Setarra’s not gonna like that.
Kim: But I do like the implications.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: That is meaty.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: That’s a really badass scene, is fucking water demon versus cyber-terminator.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: I do like the implications of this. Do I have to roll anything to smash the vial onto the ground and summon Setarra?
Rhi: You already rolled the resistance to calm yourself down.
Kim: Do I have to be calm to throw something on the ground, though?
Rhi: I think you need to— I think you have to do that to have the presence of mind to remember that it’s an option.
Kim: I think now’s the time to just use that resistance roll and then, again, do I have to roll anything to smash the vial on the ground and summon Setarra? [laughs]
Rhi: I’m gonna say no, because Setarra prepped this specifically to summon herself.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So yeah, I think you can, yeah. So, describe how that looks.
Kim: I imagine Blaire is just glancing back and forth between two of her fallen friends and sees— she probably locks eyes with this Hull and realize—
Rhi: Well, you don’t lock eyes with the Hull, because Myra is holding its head. [laughs]
Kim: Okay, so lemme take that back.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Kim: So, Blaire is glancing back and forth between two of her fallen friends and her eyes eventually just land on the Hull. And she realizes, you know, “Fuck. I can’t fight this on my own, I can’t do this alone. I need help.” And that’s the moment when she remembers I have a means of bringing Setarra here. She takes the vial out of her pocket, raises it above her head and very forcefully slams it onto the ground. The glass shatters. And whatever happens to summon Setarra just happens.
Rhi: Yeah. So, I think the glass shatters and the water splashes out, and like, it was a, you know, like a whiskey flask full of water. It wasn’t that much. But as it splashes out it keeps going and going, like, way more water than should have been there. And it goes up and forms the silhouette of Setarra and then kind of like crashes back down and she’s standing there. And she looks around, clearly sees the Hull, sees two bleeding people, looks to Blaire:
Rhi (as Setarra): Where is the demon blood?
Kim (as Blaire): [stammers] I— it’s upstairs, but I— please, please, I’ll get you there as soon as this is taken care of, but— I— mm—
Kim: And she just points at the hull.
Rhi: Yeah, she just, she looks back over at it, kinda sizes it up and then raises an eyebrow and is like:
Rhi (as Setarra): Very well.
Rhi: And the hull doesn’t quite seem to know what is happening, initially. Cause Setarra looks more of less like a Tycherosi person.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Setarra charges it, again, in sort of that, you know, the way that a wave crashes on to shore. It raises the blades again. Blades? Not terribly effective against water. So, they do cut through her, but they don’t do anything, and Setarra slams into the hull. The hull goes flying back out the door into the hall. Setarra stalks after it. And I think that there’s just crashing sounds, some sparking, some electroplasmic flashes, but the sound of the fight is kind of moving back through the hall. You, kind of, as the sounds of it are moving further away, Blaire, you can hear Setarra saying things sharply in the demonic speech. You can’t understand it exactly, but from the sound of it, it seems like, you know, most of the time when you’ve seen Setarra fight people in the past, it’s over in an instant. Like, if she is fighting a human, the human is so much wet tissue paper.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: This hull is not going down instantly. Like, it’s holding its own. Which is alarming.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Blaire is, I think, still kinda standing there frozen for a second and we’re gonna go back to Minx, who has gathered herself and is— are you just making your way back downstairs?
Josie: Yup.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Like, I’m not bolting, but I’m kind of like, light jogging.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m gonna say that a nurse moving quickly in a hospital isn’t gonna draw suspicion, particularly since you kinda, you successfully talked your way past the guards that you saw previously, so nobody really stops you. You hustle back to the stairs down to the basement and I think that’s the point where you start to get the impression that something is wrong. Because you can hear the sound of some kind of fight happening. There’s like, metal crashing, there’s like electric pops, there’s what sounds like water slammming into things? It’s very confusing. And very alarming.
Josie (as Minx): Oh heavens.
Rhi: Do with that as you will.
Josie: I’m gonna speed up.
Rhi: You basically at this point, like, once you hit the basement stairs you’re out of sight of anybody, so you can start, like, full-on running.
Rhi: So, I think you kind of round the corner and you see that big, heavy, metal door is standing open where the vault was previously. I don’t know what kinda noise is coming from in there, I don’t know how much noise Seeks and Myra are making while they’re in pain. Or if Blaire is still crying.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, if nothing else, you hear Blaire crying in that room and then the combat, fight sounds, are coming from down closer to the door.
Josie: I mean, I’m gonna go towards the sound of Blaire crying first.
Rhi: So Minx, you burst into the room. I think that it’s probably only been, like, ten seconds or so since Setarra and the hull went barreling out into the hall. What is the— Seeks, Myra, Blaire, each of you tell me kind of what— how do each of you look at this point, where are you, what are you doing?
Waffles: I think Seeks is doing a scoot along the floor, attempting to get to Myra, but has moved, like, two feet. With just a blood trail.
Minna: Honestly, I think propped up against the wall, like sitting on the ground against the wall that Ojal threw me into.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Like, trying to stop the bleeding with, like, probably ripped-off bits of skirt.
Kim: Blaire immediately realizes that Minx is into the room and she runs over to her into a hug.
Josie (as Minx): Oof, Blaire, gods, what happened?
Kim (as Blaire): [through tears] I’m sorry, I— there’s a hull here and I knew I couldn’t do it myself and Myra and Seeks, they’re— I’m sorry.
Josie (as Minx): We need to get them out of here.
Kim (as Blaire): I know, I know, but as soon as this is done I have to do something for Setarra, but then—
Josie (as Minx): Blaire… you know what? Questions for later. We need to get out, right now.
Kim (as Blaire): But—
Josie (as Minx): Which one of them can you carry?
Rhi: The back door crashes open. It sounds like from this side like the fight has moved through that door.
Josie (as Minx): We need to go now.
Kim (as Blaire): But—
Josie (as Minx): While the door’s open.
Kim (as Blaire): But—
Josie (as Minx): Which one can you carry? Can you carry Seeks?
Kim (as Blaire): I— I don’t know. I don’t know. But I can’t leave now, I—
Josie (as Minx): Blaire!
Josie: Minx is gonna put both her hands on Blaire’s shoulders and lean down a bit.
Josie (as Minx): We need to leave. Right now. You can do it. I know you can. But we need to go.
Kim: Blaire is going to, um, reach for Minx’s hands and just kinda take them off her shoulders, but still holding Minx’s hand, and just look at her squarely and be like:
Kim (as Blaire): I will meet you outside as soon as I can, but I have to see this through. I promised.
Rhi: [sucks air through teeth] Oof.
Josie (as Minx): What happened to not splitting up?
Kim (as Blaire): I… this isn’t splitting up. I’m— I just need to do this one thing. And then I’ll be— I’ll come back, I promise.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire. Is it for Setarra? Are you choosing Setarra over us right now?
Kim (as Blaire): No—
Josie (as Minx): Is that what’s happening?
Kim (as Blaire): No, that— that’s not what this is, I promise. But she wouldn’t be helping us if I didn’t promise this to her, so please, please just get them out and I promise as soon as this is done I’ll meet you there. Please.
Josie: Minx is gonna just turn away without saying anything.
Kim: Oof.
Josie: Um, and she’s gonna try and find in the hallway, like, I dunno, maybe a gurney?
Rhi: Um, yeah. There’s a lot of, like, medical supply type things down here, so yeah, you could find something with wheels that you could get them onto.
Josie: Yeah. That’s what I wanna do.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I think as Blaire is exiting the door, Minx will remember something and toss Blaire one of the smoke bombs I got from my acquire asset action last time.
Rhi: Oh yeah, yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): What’s this for?
Josie (as Minx): If you need to bail out.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx— I don’t really think this is gonna help if I have to do that.
Josie (as Minx): Well I don’t have much else! And they need help. So, make it quick.
Kim (as Blaire): I promise. I promise I will.
Rhi: So, you’re dealing with two conscious people who are able to kind of help you. Like, you’re not lifting dead weight, Minx, so you’re able to get them onto, yeah, I’m gonna say that there’s a gurney that they can, kind of like, both sort of sit, lay, lean on.
Waffles: Um, I don’t know if I’m out of action, but if I’m not I can have an ability if Minx helps, because I need help to do anything. I can roll Tinkers to have us ignore our harm for the next hour.
Rhi: As long as it doesn’t cost stress, you can do it.
Waffles: It would cost stress for me to do it on me.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, so you can patch up Myra with Minx’s help, yeah. You can take the time to do that here.
Waffles: Yeah, I think I have just enough weird alchemical things to stop the bleeding on one person.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Then Myra is, well, we’re not gonna say fine, but not actively bleeding out. And so I think Minx and Myra, the two of you can kind of carry Seeks out.
Josie: Alright.
Rhi: I think we see the two of you, like, sorry, we see the three of you slowly leaving this vault and, like, following the trail of water out to the— towards the back door. Blaire.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: You are not in disguise.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: You are actively distressed.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Look like you’ve been crying. And you’re running up into this hospital.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: What is your plan?
Kim: Get up to the third floor. [laughs] With Setarra.
Rhi: Okay. There are— well, Setarra went out the back door.
Kim: So, Setarra’s gone?
Rhi: You don’t know.
Kim: Oh, fuck. Um. Um. What do I have to roll to find her again?
Rhi: Uh, go to the back door? [laughs]
Kim: Okay, okay, Blaire goes to the back door.
Rhi: And then, I mean, if Blaire is running down there, you’re going to pass your friends.
Kim: Okay. I mean, she needs to get— she needs to get to Setarra and bring her to the third floor. That was the deal. So yeah, she’s gonna do that.
Rhi: Okay. So, you sprint past your friends to the back door, and you see— there’s basically water all the way down the hall and out the door. The back door is just gone.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: There’s water down the stairs. There’s also a lot of blood from the dead guard.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Sucks for his twins and his husband that you all created earlier in this session.
Kim: [laughs] I knew that was gonna come back to haunt us, but it was worth it. Anyway…
Rhi: And if you run down the stairs, the dock is kinda smashed up, but there’s no sign of either the hull or Setarra down there.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh fuck. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck. Um.
Kim: Blaire’s just gonna call out Setarra’s name and just do whatever she can to find her.
Rhi: I mean, calling to her does not get any kind of response.
Kim: And me looking into the ghost field wouldn’t do anything either, because they don’t have a signature in the ghost field.
Rhi: Nope. [laughs] They specifically do not show up in the ghost field.
Kim: Blaire is just gonna stand at the dock, just staring out at a loss for just a few minutes, and then she’s going to run back to the rest of the crew.
Rhi: I think that by the time you run back they’re basically at the top of the stairs and you can help them with the stairs. And I think that Kay had said she was gonna be going up and down the river, she saw Blaire standing there and started coming over, so I think by the time everybody gets down to the back stairs she is there and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Oh, that’s a lot of blood. Okay, let’s get you in here.
Rhi: And will help you all load up and take you all wherever you need to go.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Drop me off as close to blah blah blah, rendezvous point as possible. Get these back to Seeks’s place.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, let’s say that it’s like somewhere in Barrowcleft.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: So yeah, she will drop you off, Minx, and take the rest of you, like, she will tie off the gondola and help carry Seeks back to the place and will, like, stick around to help patch people up. She is not a trained physicker, but she can, you know, follow directions and will help kinda get the bleeding stabilized, at least.
When Minx comes across the cab, the carriage is parked, the goats are just sort of standing there chewing on something thoughtfully, the Cabbie is leaning against the cab, smoking something. And when you come up is like:
Rhi (as Cabbie): Uh, you didn’t really specify what condition you wanted him in. I had to knock him out, cause he kept trying to make a run for it. I’m sorry about that, if that’s a—
Josie (as Minx): Perfect, thank you.
Rhi (as Cabbie): Okay.
Josie (as Minx): Let me get him out so this is cleaner.
Rhi (as Cabbie): Oh, I see.
Josie (as Minx): You may wish to leave.
Rhi (as Cabbie): Yep. Yeah, I… yep. Uh…
Josie: Yeah, I think Minx is just gonna open one of the doors to the cab, yank Hagen down onto the cobblestones by the collar, bullet in the forehead.
Rhi: Okay. And just gonna leave him on the street?
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: Full-on execution.
Waffles: The single sound of a deathseeker crow overhead. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, like, I think what it is, is that there’s the echo of the gunshot that then turns into the clanging of the death bell ringing out over the city. So, that is that score. [laughs]
Josie: Uh huh.
Kim: That is certainly a thing that happened.
Rhi: Yeah. That— Blaire has some shit to deal with now.
Kim: [laughs] Oh yes.
Josie: Uh, yeah!
Rhi: From all sides.
Kim: Oh yes. Blaire’s in trouble [laughs]
Rhi: Blaire is in trouble from basically everybody.
Kim: [laughs] I had to make in-character decisions, I’m sorry!
Rhi: No, absolutely.
Waffles: No, it’s good.
Rhi: Absolutely. It’s very good, but like, this is gonna get real rough for her.
Kim: That was the point of the season.
Rhi: So, let’s get into our downtime scenes. I think we’re gonna start at the clinic, pretty much shortly after everyone has gotten in there. Kay is still there, kind of being an orderly, more or less, fetching bandages and potions and things. What are the three of you who are there right now, how are you all looking?
Waffles: I have busted out the secret stash of painkillers for everyone involved.
[laughter]
Rhi: Blaire, was not injured, is being offered painkillers.
Waffles (as Seeks): [slurred] Are ya sure? They’re really good.
Rhi: Kay. Kay wasn’t on the score and is getting offered painkillers.
Minna: Myra is probably lying on a bed, getting tended to. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Blaire’s just crying.
Rhi: Aww.
Kim: And probably hugging Myra.
Minna: Yeah, I think Myra would have been like:
Minna (as Myra): Come here, come here, come here.
Minna: And she’s kinda like holding Blaire’s hand, and…
Kim: Yeah, Blaire’s just crying and hugging Myra, honestly.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: That’s what she’s doing.
Minna (as Myra): It’s okay, it’s okay. I’m here. I’ll be fine.
Rhi: Making all the appropriate soothing noises.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, did Myra partake of any of the painkillers?
Minna: Absolutely.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] So Myra is slowly getting high as a kite. Seeks—
Minna: I mean, she’s already a frequent drug user. She’s not gonna turn it down. But also, painkillers good right now.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Seeks is pretty spacey at this point, I imagine.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh, everyone, I was gonna tell you when we were done. I’m doing a marriage. Parris and I are doing marr— I need bridesmaids! Is the thing I need.
Kim (as Blaire): What? Wh— what?
Waffles (as Seeks): I need bridesmaids.
Kim (as Blaire): Why?
Waffles (as Seeks): For marriage.
Minna (as Myra): Are you asking us? Were you asking for recommendations?
Waffles (as Seeks): Well that’s what I ask.
Minna (as Myra): [amused] Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Seeks, you know that I love you, but you really thought now was the best time to do this?
Minna: [laughs]
[laughter]
Waffles (as Seeks): I had planned on it. I dunno.
Waffles: And passes out.
Rhi: Seeks is unconscious.
[laughter]
Rhi: And I think that is when the— Kay is sorta standing there like, “Is—is it okay that she’s unconscious?” Like, she not saying this, but her face is very much like, “Is that okay? Is it okay that she passed out? She’s the doctor! Oh God!”
Josie and Waffles: [laugh]
Rhi: Like, mildly panicking. And I think that’s the point at which… I think a little while ago you all heard, kind of muffled, the tolling of the death bell. And it has since stopped ringing. And the door swings open and Minx walks in.
Josie: Well, I imagine Kay is closest to the door.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: So, she first kind of just like gently brushes her arm and says:
Josie (as Minx): Thank you, dear, for all of your help once again.
Rhi (as Kay): Of course. Um… she’s the physicker and she’s unconscious, do you know somebody else I should grab to maybe help? I don’t…
Josie (as Minx): It’s my understanding this is… she’s like this frequently due to the medication.
Rhi (as Kay): Okay. Do you need anything else? Do you need me to pick anybody or anything up?
Josie (as Minx): No. No, the business is handled.
Rhi (as Kay): Okay.
Josie (as Minx): Although I may be catching a ride home early, if you want some company this evening.
Ri (as Kay): Yeah. I can, uh, I can wait outside.
Josie (as Minx): Alright. Thank you.
Rhi: I think she kinda looks back around the room at the three of you and is like:
Rhi (as Kay): Be as safe as you all can, alright? I don’t wanna have to do another trip like that.
Rhi: I think she kinda squeezes Minx on the shoulder and then is gonna head back outside. Yeah, she’ll hang out in her boat until…
Josie: Minx sort of smiles wearily and then goes over to check on Myra.
Josie (as Minx): How are things with you?
Minna (as Myra): I… will live.
Josie (as Minx): Well, that is more certain than earlier.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Oh… don’t make me laugh.
Kim (as Blaire): You really scared us, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): I know. But she was coming after you and Seeks as well as me, and it’s my fault that she was there for me in the first place.
Josie (as Minx): Who?
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Minna (as Myra): So I wasn’t a—
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, Myra this was not—
Josie (as Minx): Who was there?
Minna (as Myra): Ojal’s a hull now.
Josie (as Minx): A hull?
Minna (as Myra): Her spirit was captured in a crystal and put in a metal body that has blades for hands and can… [sighs] did this to us.
Josie (as Minx): There really is no limit to depths Salia will sink to, is there?
Minna (as Myra): There really isn’t.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I’m just glad you survived.
Kim (as Blaire): How do we stop Ojal?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know if that’s a question about how hulls work… I don’t know how to answer that question right now. We have to do research.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra… okay, I’ll research that, but Myra, we can’t… we can’t do this again. This has to stop.
Josie: While Blaire is talking, Minx will just go over to Seeks. Like, check her forehead temperature, make sure she’s breathing, and just blatantly turn away whenever Blaire speaks up.
Minna (as Myra): I did not want to do this in the first place, and if I could avoid fighting her like that again, that would be great, but I don’t think she’s going to stop and I really don’t think Salia’s going to stop.
Kim (as Blaire): So we—s o we destroy the Hull and we kill Salia, I don’t care what it takes, but I— I don’t want this happening again. To any of us. That was—
Minna (as Myra): I’m not disagreeing with you, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, it was too close.
Minna (as Myra): I know. That was frankly terrifying. I’ve never dealt with anything with that kind of strength or will to kill me. Frankly.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm hmm.
Josie (as Minx): Of course, it being that close didn’t make you want to stay any more.
Josie: And then I think Minx is gonna walk out and meet Kay.
Kim: Oof. [laughs] Oof.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire? Next time Setarra asks something from you, let us know. It’ll become our mutual priority, but it can’t split us up.
Kim (as Blaire): It didn’t even matter by the end of that, because— because by the time I tried to find her, she was gone. So, it doesn’t matter. Of course it won’t happen again.
Minna (as Myra): I just want you to know that your problems are our problems too.
Kim (as Blaire): Setarra isn’t a problem.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] I meant your responsibilities, your goals, your debts. They affect us and-
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t have a debt to her. What are you talking about?
Minna (as Myra): Whatever drove you to go alone up to the third floor. We would have liked to have known about it and been able to help you with it.
Kim (as Blaire): She showed up on the score. I didn’t get a chance to tell any of you. She just kinda showed up.
Minna (as Myra): And that’s fair. She does that. Just, I don’t want you to go alone because I don’t want you to get hurt either. We made a promise—
Kim (as Blaire): Setarra wouldn’t hurt me— I know. I know. But Setarra wouldn’t hurt me.
Minna (as Myra): Whatever obstacles you would have faced trying to do that would hurt you.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t know that. I just had to go up to the third floor and show Setarra something, that was all. And in the end, she bailed out on me. So it would have been fine either way.
Minna (as Myra): I understand the thought process behind it and I’m sorry that Setarra didn’t show up like you wanted her to. I’m just saying that I think we should try and let each other know about things that we need to do and not go alone. There are three of us against this whole city, it feels like sometimes. One against the whole city is too small, too small an odds.
Rhi: I think from there we kinda fade out and we’ll fade back in on the common room of the nest. I think Blaire is gonna kind of trudge in.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Minx is at the dining table. She has placed some candles about so as to create the most severe lighting.
Kim: Of course.
Josie: Cause she had some time to plan this.
Rhi: I love that even at her most angry and disappointed, the commitment to the aesthetic is unwavering.
[laughter]
Josie: Yes.
Kim: It also just kind of has the same energy of, like, a child sneaking back home late at night past curfew and a parent being awake, being like, “So where have you been?”
Rhi: Yeah, that’s the exact energy of this moment.
Minna: What I was gonna say is that Minx is just a walking anime.
Kim: That too, but that goes without saying.
Rhi: There’s also that.
Waffles: One fear.
Josie: Minx would love an anime convention, let’s be real.
Kim: This is true.
Rhi: Yeah. So yeah, Minx is at the table, dramatic candles.
Josie: She’s still done up. She’s got her hands, one of her hands in her lap and is kind of resting her cheek on the other one.
Josie (as Minx): You were going to leave.
Kim (as Blaire): What are you talking about?
Josie (as Minx): When our roommates and our family were bleeding out, as soon as I showed up you were going to leave them.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s not what that was about. The reason that all of you were able to get out in the first place was because of Setarra and she wouldn’t have done that if I didn’t promise something to her. So I had to see that through, because if I didn’t, something could have happened to me or to all of us.
Josie (as Minx): When did you promise something to her?
Kim (as Blaire): She showed up to me during the score and I didn’t have time to tell all of you afterwards. And I’m sorry that happened—
Josie (as Minx): Bullshit, Blaire. It was silent, we were all there, it was a very controlled situation. You couldn’t have told us that Setarra requested something of you? And instead you decided to try and do it after foisting our bleeding compatriots off on me.
Kim (as Blaire): If I had gone with you then Setarra would have thought that I was bailing on her and then something could have happened to all of us.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): I didn’t want that to happen.
Josie (as Minx): For the record, I don’t mind that Setarra showed up. It saved our arses. But do you really think you couldn’t have at least helped them to safety?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know. I don’t— I wasn’t thinking and I—
Josie (as Minx): Clearly not.
Kim (as Blaire): I was scared.
Josie (as Minx): And yet, in that fear, instead of even running for your own life, you sought to obey Setarra.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, it’s not that simple.
Josie (as Minx): Here’s the situation. You assured us that Setarra is no problem. We worry about you sometimes, but we trusted that. But in the direst of situations, you chose her over us.
Kim (as Blaire): I didn’t. I— Minx, I was going to come back for all of you. I did what I said I was going to do and I had to do because I was choosing all of you.
Josie (as Minx): Then why did you accept this task from Setarra, not tell anyone, and then we wind up in this situation?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know how we wound up in this situation, but I— you know how it was the last time I tried to introduce all of you to Setarra. She didn’t like it. So, I— I just thought that—
Josie (as Minx): No. And then we spent hours looking for you. And even after all that, you couldn’t even find it in yourself to be forthright with us about it.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx… I’m sorry.
Josie (as Minx): Are you?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes!
Josie (as Minx): Let me ask another question then. If it does come down to Setarra or us, who are you choosing?
Kim (as Blaire): You.
Josie: What is the look in Blaire’s eye like when she says that?
Kim: I mean, she’s probably been crying this whole time, so her eyes are very watery, but the look in her eyes are very determined and fierce, to the point where I think it’s immediately apparent that anyone can tell that she is not lying and she fiercely believes this to be true.
Josie: It’ll have to do for now. Minx sort of leans back in her chair a little bit like she’s kind of exhausted. Because honestly, she is. She pulls her hand out of her lap and she’s just sort of gently holding a piece of thin blue fabric that looks like the end of a scarf.
Josie (as Minx): You know I’m going to hold you to that.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes. Yes, I… I wouldn’t expect anything less.
Josie (as Minx): Because normally I treat things like this very differently. But—
Kim (as Blaire): How differently?
Josie (as Minx): Very differently. But you’re crew and you’re my friend. So I don’t know where we go from here.
Kim (as Blaire): I was a bad friend to you and I failed the crew, so I don’t know either.
Josie (as Minx): I think what with The Circle and everything else, we just need to move forward.
Kim (as Blaire): How?
Josie (as Minx): I don’t know. I’m a bit of a hypocrite for chastising you for this given how I’ve treated Bazso. So, perhaps it’s just we sleep on it and we figure it out as we go.
Kim (as Blaire): This doesn’t feel like the kind of thing we sleep off, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): I know, but it’s not the sort of thing that gets solved in a night either, I don’t think. I believe you when you say you are going to prioritize us. And that’s really all I can ask for right now.
Kim (as Blaire): You know I’m gonna keep seeing her, don’t you?
Josie (as Minx): I know.
Kim (as Blaire): I have to.
Josie (as Minx): Why do you have to?
Kim (as Blaire): I made a promise.
Josie (as Minx): What did you promise her?
Kim (as Blaire): I was the one who brought her here in the first place, so… I don’t know.
Josie (as Minx): Well, you’re going to have to fill Myra and I in on all the details eventually. You know that, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Because you know Setarra is dangerous.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, she has to be.
Josie (as Minx): I don’t know her and I can’t trust her judgement on that, so… and I can’t really stop you from doing this, but please, please, if she starts to drive another wedge or starts asking bad things of you, you come to us. Right? We can’t really fight a demon, but we can help you.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Josie (as Minx): Okay. You know this isn’t reallu the kind of stuff I signed up for, but it’s… I suppose it’s to be expected.
Josie: She kind of looks down at the piece of scarf meaningfully and then gets up and goes to her room.
Kim: So yeah, Blaire just… she’s just standing there frozen for, I would say, a good five minutes before she remembers she has somewhere she needs to be and heads out.
[silence]
Kim: Yeah, she’s probably gonna head for the docks.
Rhi: Okay. Um, so I think we see Blaire still very upset, pacing along the docks. You know, the waves coming in, crashing against the pier. Again, there’s that same where a larger wave crashes and then Setarra is standing there. Doesn’t say anything. Just has her arms folded and eyebrows raised and is looking at Blaire very expectantly.
Kim (as Blaire): I would have brought you to third floor if you’d just stayed.
Rhi (as Setarra): Well, you threw a rather difficult obstacle in my path.
Kim (as Blaire): But you still cleared it. We could have gone up to the third floor together. Were you hurt?
Rhi: I think that like… yeah, when you say that, she kind of looks at her arm and the water, like, dark stain on her bicep. You can’t tell if it’s… it doesn’t look like regular blood, but it’s a dark stain there. She’s like:
Rhi (as Setarra): Nothing that won’t recover, given time.
Kim (as Blaire): Is that why you retreated after it was taken care of?
Rhi (as Setarra): You seemed to have other priorities than upholding our bargain.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s not true. I was trying— I— I’ll admit I had multiple things going on, but I was going to take care of you first, before I—
Rhi (as Setarra): You can’t have it both ways, Blaire. Some day, some day soon, you are going to have to choose where your loyalty lies. And you are going to have to remember who has helped you, who has offered you all of the knowledge that you seek. You want to bring ghosts back. You want to uncover the secrets of the universe. Do you think they’re going to help you? Will they be able to give you what you need to accomplish all that you dream of?
Kim (as Blaire): They have so far.
Rhi: And she sort of narrows her eyes and is like:
Rhi (as Setarra): Well. If you don’t need me then…
Rhi: And then kind of very ostentatiously, like, turns and makes to walk towards the end of the dock.
Kim: Blaire’s just gonna let her.
Rhi: Interesting. Alright. So, Setarra kinda slows down as she gets to end of the dock, doesn’t look back, but is kind of like, her steps slow a little bit, but she does not stop before she just sort of disappears back into the water. And then I think we will return to the clinic. It’s a few days later. Seeks and Myra are both still recovering, but doing a little better. Seeks can kind of hobble around and make tea. And I think Minx is going to come in accompanying Liege Greer Evermar. They are wearing a very, like, nice, sharply-tailored, dark red suit with gold trim and buttons and stuff. And they step inside and sort of look around a little bit.
Waffles (as Seeks): Uh, hello!
Josie (as Minx): Good evening.
Rhi (as Liege Greer): Hello. I’d heard that you all ran into a bit of trouble. Are you alright?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, trouble is somewhat what we do, but we’re glad you could make it.
Rhi (as Liege Greer): Yes. Well, it was really quite tragic to hear of Dr Hagen’s untimely demise, but the streets can be ever so dangerous after dark. [clears throat]
Rhi: And like, it’s very just kind of like, rote.
Kim: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Of course. But at least the clinic will stay open to help the people of Duskwall.
Rhi (as Liege Greer): Yes, and uh…
Josie (as Minx): Speaking of…
Rhi (as Liege Greer): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): Liege Greer, this is Seeks.
Waffles (as Seeks): Greetings. Would you like some tea?
Rhi (as Liege Greer): Um, certainly. I’ve heard a bit about you, but I’m looking forward to getting to know you better. And hopefully this will be a good partnership going forward.
Rhi: And they will, like, sit down and accept some tea. And I think that they and Seeks will kind of start discussing some details about the clinic. And I think, kind of, just before we fade out, Greer will set a piece of paper on the table and you can see the name “The Teagen Welker Clinic” at the top.
Minna: Oh…
Josie: Aww.

"Season 3, Episode 10: The Occult Security Score Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter)
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us. We’re gotten a lot of new fans lately, which is awesome. Reviews and tweets can help bring those new people in, so please keep telling your friends and followers about the show. You can also support us financially on Patreon or by purchasing a Magpies pin of your very own on our Shapeways store. All your support, in all its many forms, is wonderful and appreciated.
If you follow The Magpies on Twitter, you have probably seen me tweeting a lot about Descent into Midnight. The Kickstarter both launched and funded last Saturday, which is absolutely amazing. It also means that if you back the game now, you are guaranteed to get your reward. At this point, it’s all stretch goals for this incredible game about community, family, hope and fighting corruption. I really believe that if you love the stories we tell here on Magpies, you will also love the stories that you can tell with Descent Into Midnight. We have some very cool stretch goals planned, but the one I’m most excited about is that the Streampunks, led by GM Eric Campbell, will be producing a Descent into Midnight series, with one episode for every stretch goal the campaign hits. As a reminder, I am the accessibility consultant on this project, so I do have a vested interest in its success, but it’s also a game that I love a lot and project that I believe in deeply. So, take a few minutes and go check it out.
Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s featured charities.
Kim: There’s a lot of misinformation circulating around the Coronavirus outbreak right now, but I think one thing that’s definitely true is that doctors and hospitals are rapidly running out of supplies. I wanted to feature a way to help Wuhan this month because the outbreak is absolutely a crisis in China right now, and I haven’t seen any charities or fundraisers boosted, or seen any way at all people outside of China can help. In my research, I found a GoFundMe page to raise money for medical supplies to send to Wuhan. I believe it to be legitimate, the page has been organized by the Canadian Society for Virology, Dalhousie University and other members of the Canadian medical community. The money being raised will be going to purchasing and sending supplies like protective suits, masks, goggles, etc to hospitals in need over in China. As of this recording they’ve raised nearly $23,000 out of a $50,000 goal and I think it would be a great cause to give to.
I’m not sure how these organizers will be ensuring that these supplies will actually reach the hospitals that need them and I understand if you feel wary about giving to a cause like this at this time. If you feel at all apprehensive, I encourage our US listeners to simply donate to your presidential and/or senatorial candidates instead. If you’re in a red state and there’s a candidate for senate that’s challenging your current representative, I am actually begging you to donate to them, support them and vote for them, because I want as many of these 51 traitors out of a job as we possibly can. Please, please, please, please do that for me. And for those of us in blue states who already have democratic representatives, or if you live in a state where your senator isn’t up for re-election, I encourage you to find your own ways to pitch in and help turn the tide in November. Thank you.
Rhi: Please continue to call your representatives and take action where you live. A lot of really scary things are happening in the wake of the GOP’s acquittal of Trump, and we need to take action when and where we can. In addition to organizations like 5calls.org, I also want to point folks to Fair Fight, an organization aimed at expanding and protecting voting rights. The GOP’s election year strategy is disinformation, voter suppression, and outright violations of the law in order to maintain their grip on power. We need to do everything we can to overcome this. And on that note, please make sure you are registered to vote and make sure you know when your local primaries are. And do your research, not just on presidential candidates, but all the way down the ticket to state and local elections as well. Those make a huge difference for our communities.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [00.04.41]
Rhi: We begin on, once again, a new article in the Doskvol Daily. The paper is dated a couple weeks after the break-in at the clinic, and the headline reads, “Charterhall Clinic Opens Under New Ownership,” By Anita Argent, staff reporter. “While the tragic and sudden murder of Dr Elias Hagen remains yet unsolved, there is a spark of hope to be found in these dark times. Lady Verena and Liege Greer Evermar have purchased the clinic from Rolan Hagen, Dr Hagen’s widower, and are preparing to reopen it in partnership with the charity of The Weeping Lady. ‘Dr Hagen did remarkable work for the city,’ Liege Greer said in a prepared statement. ‘We hope to continue that work and advance the cause of medicine and health for all citizens of Duskwall.’ When asked about the new name for the clinic, the Tegan Welker Memorial—”
Minna: [delighted outburst]
Rhi: “Liege Greer simply said, ‘It was named in memory of someone the clinic was unable to save.’ Mother Elsbeth Naria, the proprietor of The Arms of the Weeping Lady, echoed Liege Greer’s hopeful words. ‘The Evermar’s commitment to charity and generosity is well-known in the city, and we couldn’t be happier to hear of their latest endeavor,’ she told the Daily. But not everyone is happy about the clinic’s new ownership. Preceptor Dunvil, of the Church of Ecstasy, and long-time friend of Dr Hagen, expressed some doubts as to the fitness of the new Chief Physicker. ‘The Evermars are a fine family, to be sure. But they’re not well-versed in the medical arts,’ he said, ‘and this Seeks individual is a complete unknown to the medical community. The Church intends to investigate the matter thoroughly so the public can be assured of the quality of this new operation.’ The new Chief Physicker, a mysterious, evasive Tycherosi known as The Rivers Lost But Seeking, offered only this as explanation for her plans. ‘To heal people. What else does a clinic do?’”
Minna: [giggles]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Did you reach out to Waffles for that statement?
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah, I did.
Minna: Uh huh!
Rhi: I was like—[laughs] Well, first I was like, “How will Seeks respond if a reporter approaches her with questions about the clinic?” and Waffles was like, “Uh, throw a smoke grenade and run away.”
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] “Brandishing a knife. ‘Who are you?’”
Minna: [laughs] I love Seeks.
Rhi: Seeks is real good. [laughs] So, I think we pull out from this article to find it on a familiar table in the Hound’s Paw. And the paper is sitting on The Magpies’ usual table, but the Magpies aren’t there. What we see is Rigney is at the bar, and facing him at the other side of the bar are a trio of Bluecoats who are standing there looking, you know, with kind of smug smirks as Rigney is counting out some coin from the register. And he, you know, kind of puts it into a pouch and slides it across, and one of them picks it up and tucks it into his coat and then tips his hat and is like:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Well, glad to see that you’re so reliable. We’ll be back next week.
Rhi: And Rigney just kind of is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah. Great. See ya.
Rhi: And they stroll out. So, I think that there’s— he kinda stands there for a minute waiting, like, I think you kinda get the sense of like, he’s tapping his finger on the bar like he’s counting, and then eventually he kinda straightens up and goes back to the back room and opens it up and is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, they’re gone. You can come out.
Rhi: And the three of you have been waiting in the back room for the Bluecoats to leave. So, yeah, you come back out into the bar.
Josie (as Minx): Heavens. They do come around more frequently, do they?
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah. And their prices keep going up. I don’t want them to smash the place to smithereens again, so…
Josie (as Minx): Well, we’ll have to do something about that.
Kim (as Blaire): Who do we put in jail to get them to stop?
Josie (as Minx): Do we have any more people to put in jail? I do not think that will last forever.
Rhi (as Rigney): No. I mean, there was that Bluecoat officer you framed a while back, and that kinda got them to back off for a bit, but…
Josie (as Minx): Right. Well, that was not the first time we have sent someone away to take the pressure off. Not certain how many more times we can get away with that.
Minna (as Myra): It seems the way that most people keep the Bluecoats’ eyes off them involves a lot more money than we currently have.
Kim (as Blaire): We could rob a bank.
Josie (as Minx): What?
Kim (as Blaire): We could rob a bank.
Josie (as Minx): I… I suppose we could do that.
Minna (as Myra): That is an idea.
Rhi (as Rigney): I’m… gonna go…
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, no.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi (as Rigney): Why don’t you go over to your table?
Minna (as Myra): You don’t need to be here for this.
Rhi (as Rigney): And talk about… crimes that you may or may not be committing, that the less I know about the better?
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Sorry, Rigney.
Rhi: Rigney shoos you over to your table so he can have plausible deniability.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps put on some music, dear. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, Rigney will get you your usual selection of drinks and bring them over, and then, like, goes to the bar and starts like, you know, polishing glasses or wiping down the bar and is pointedly humming to himself. [laughs] So that he can’t hear anything you’re saying.
Josie (as Minx): So, I think Blaire may have just pointed out the option that has been under our noses for quite some time now. We haven’t done a score for money in months.
Kim (as Blaire): I have no money.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I’m aware, dear. And I am somewhat tired of buying your meals for you, although I’m sure you appreciate the improved diet, yes?
Kim (as Blaire): It’s kind of… bland.
Josie (as Minx): Bland, huh?
Kim (as Blaire): [stammers] I—uh—
Josie (as Minx): Then we definitely need to rob a bank, Blaire. I did not know you had such discerning taste. We need to up the palate a bit.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm… no, I mean, I’m good with, you know, the… the… you know, the kelp chips and the eel and the mushrooms and…
Josie (as Minx): Yes but there’s— you are absolutely right. I have had my side gig for so long that I was experiencing contentment. We need to, what would you call it, up our standard of living.
Kim (as Blaire): What if we got chicken?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, that would be divine.
Kim (as Blaire): [giggles]
Minna (as Myra): Let’s not count our eggs before they hatch.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs]
Rhi: Rigney groans.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Rigney, you’re not listening.
Rhi (as Rigney): I’m… that got through!
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs]
Rhi (as Rigney): You should be ashamed of yourself, Myra.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh my gods.
Minna (as Myra): Never.
Rhi (as Rigney): Robbing a bank is one thing, but puns of that caliber…
Minna: Is Rigney just the GM insert now? [laughs]
Kim: You’re just catching on to this?
Josie: Hasn’t he always been?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Fair.
Rhi: Rigney… is my son?
[laughter]
Rhi: I raised my boy right. He doesn’t appreciate puns.
Josie (as Minx): Where can we actually get away with?
Minna (as Myra): Certainly not the larger banks.
Josie: Real quick.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: So, the Umbra Hunters uniform. What does that look like?
Minna: It has brass or bronze on it.
Rhi: Yeah, black with brass details.
Josie: How hard is that to just mock up? Like, I imagine not super difficult, right?
Minna: We might still have some.
Rhi: You might, yeah…
Minna: We’ve stolen some before.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Oh right, we have.
Rhi: I’m pretty sure the ones you stole have gotten damaged.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: You say that as though I am not here and fully capable of sewing.
Minna: So we’re gonna impersonate Umbra Hunters while we’re doing this?
Rhi: Yeah, you could definitely do that.
Josie: Think about it. With Brogan gone once again, it’s reasonable to think that some of them got cut-off, money-wise.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Josie: So, it makes sense for them to just smash and grab for money.
Rhi: I mean, yeah, that could potentially work.
Josie: And now it just comes down to the straight-forward task of infiltrating a bank and making it out with a large amount of money.
Rhi: I think as you are talking about, like, “Oh we just have to find a bank to hit,” Rigney will come back over with probably, at this point, unnecessary refills on your drinks and is just like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Guy I pay rent to is at Templesmith Bank and Trust.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Pouring your drinks.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you. We will take that recommendation under consideration.
Rhi (as Rigney): Just saying. My landlord kinda sucks.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): We understand what you’re saying perfectly.
Josie (as Minx): Although we can always help you if rent goes up for whatever reason that I do not know.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, I’ll let you know if it does.
Rhi: [laughs] He will remove himself back to the bar, where he has no idea what you’re doing with this information, of course.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So yeah, you all can kinda check out this bank. It is Templesmith Bank and Trust. It’s located in Charterhall. And yeah, mostly it’s the upper classes. It’s not as, like, intense as Saltford’s. Doesn’t have that reputation. But it’s a, you know, big, fancy, expensive-looking bank building. And so, you all can kinda, if you wanna do some Gather Info on the location?
Josie: Yes. I think Minx wants to study… Study, because I have a dot in that now, teller protocol and the like? Partially for this bank specifically, but also just in general how a bank works.
Rhi: Yeah. Go ahead and make a roll.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: I’m gonna say you’re gonna basically have improved effect whenever you are trying to interact with the normal business operations of the bank.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, like, if you are trying to impersonate a teller you’ll be at improved effect. Okay, so yeah, Minx knows how banks work.
Kim: Vaguely.
Rhi: Yeah. Vaguely.
Kim: I want to roll a Study to see if Templesmith bank has any, you know, ghost wards or electroplasmic locks, stuff of that nature.
Rhi: Okay, yeah.
Kim: Okay. 4 and a 6.
Rhi: So, what you find is that they have kind of standard anti-ghost wards, which most public buildings have and which you know are reasonably easy for somebody with your skills to overpower and overcome.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s nothing unexpected, nothing you haven’t dealt with before, and nothing you can’t deal with pretty well, you think.
Kim: Cool.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I would like to see if I can find out about the security. Not, like, specifically with spirits, but security in general.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I think Study. Just like, very carefully, like, a mixture of watching and reading up on typical things for banks. Like, industry standard for this kind of bank and that kind of thing.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, yeah, you can definitely do that. So, go ahead and make your roll.
Minna: I don’t know if that or Consort would be better. But you know what, I think that works. Because I don’t wanna tip people off that I’m interested in this bank.
Rhi: I think all three of you have rolled Study.
Rhi: Well, if you wanna prepare for an elaborate bank heist, study up.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Well, I mean, Blaire is an A-minus student.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): I’m A-plus! I’m still A-plus, even though I got a 3.9, I’m still A-plus.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Of course, dear.
Rhi: You got expelled!
Kim: [laughs]
Minna: She wasn’t expelled for her grades.
Kim: No.
Rhi: Fair. True.
Minna: She was expelled for behavioral— oh my god.
Josie: One can argue she was too good.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: In an alternate universe, Blaire is valedictorian at Charterhall.
Minna: Really? Fuck you. The dice. I rolled four dice and I got 3.
Rhi: Oh no. Okay, so what you get is the security on this place is quite good. You learn this because the security guards keep chasing you away.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: From lingering too long in any one spot. So, you’re not really able to get a, like, you know that they have pretty impressive locks, you know that they have a lot of sparkcraft security and alarms and stuff, and they have a lot of security guards who are really good at their jobs, because any time they see you loitering around for more than five minutes, one of them comes over and starts asking you what your business is and then will either, if you lie, forcibly escort you to where your business is supposed to be or ask you to leave.
Josie: Interesting.
Rhi: So, a bank. Security is kind of the main thing that you market on.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: [laughs] “We will keep your money safer than anyone else.”
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, yeah. Any other, like, prep stuff, Gather Info you wanna do? You’re not limited to one Gather Info action per person. I know that’s normally how we do it, but you can all, if there’s other stuff you wanna find.
Josie: Okay. Do I know from my first one what emergency procedures look like?
Rhi: Like, fire drills or stuff like that?
Josie: Yeah, or someone starts firing guns in the lobby, what do you do? [laughs]
Rhi: Oh Jesus. Yes, you know what those are—
Josie: I’m not saying that’s the plan. I just… wanna know. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, there’s information about— you got a 6 on that roll, so you also would have information on, like, evacuation procedures and lockdown procedures. So like, if the building is on fire, how do people get out, or if— it does have, like, there’s a lot of stuff about— I think you actually would know how the bank staff would respond in the event of a robbery.
Josie: I have a weird idea.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: We stage some sort of night assault.
Rhi: Uh huh….
Josie: The vault that they’ve got is compromised…
Minna: That requires a lot of setup.
Josie: What about a two-pronged thing? The other two work on sewing the deceit that things are compromised. In the wake of this, hopefully they bring on more security and I try to get hired.
Rhi: Oh, interesting. Yeah. So, I like the idea of starting with having you all just, like, spreading rumors about, like, the vault is no longer safe.
Minna: We can… it could even be like dueling clocks of, like, we have a good setup versus the bank realizes something is up.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. So, whoever wants to kinda start making rolls, just tell me what you wanna do to persuade them that their vault is imperiled.
Kim: Hmm. I’ll go first.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: I have to think about this though, because Blaire is not…
Josie: Maybe you can put some mystic-looking bullshit near the wall outside, so it looks like something’s happening there?
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: That is very good.
Minna: Just a big thing that looks like it’s trying to be a Stargate through their wall.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Kim: But in reality, it’s all gibberish.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and make some kind of a roll for that.
Kim: I think Finesse best fits this.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Ooh, I almost had a heart attack, because that was a 1 and a 6.
Rhi: Hoo, okay.
Kim: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: Describe how this looks with Blaire doing this… wall art.
Kim: She is doing this in blood that she has lying around.
Rhi: [laughs] You know what? I’m not gonna ask questions.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: I like leaving that statement as is. Continue.
[laughter]
Josie: Alright then!
Kim: And, um… yeah, oddly enough, it is very similar to Setarra’s summoning circle, because Blaire studied that a lot. But it’s missing some gaps, it’s missing some details, and it’s obviously incredibly crude and not in the material that would summon Setarra. So, yeah, she just leaves that. Like, right next to the dumpster.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. So, I think that we see Blaire doing that and then the next day one of you goes by and there’s like a cluster of security guards out there, just looking at this and being like, “Aw, crap.” [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: “What does this mean? We’re not paid… we don’t… uh…” [laughs] Okay, I think, you know what? I think Minna was correct that this does need to be two clocks. So, I’m gonna do another 6-mark clock of the bank does something to its security that’s good for you. So, that is gonna fill in, that 6 is gonna get you two ticks. Who else wants to do a thing?
Josie: I… I have an idea. [laughs]
Minna: Ooh.
Rhi: Mm hmm?
Josie: I have the identity prepped because we set it up for an earlier episode and then didn’t get to use it.
Rhi: Uh… for which identity?
Josie: Well, we originally set it up as, like, a “liquidate your housing cause it’s haunted” thing.
Rhi: Oh no! Yeah, yeah… yeah.
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Josie: I want to pass off as an occult security specialist.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Yep.
Josie: [laughs] I’m gonna make some shit up and it’s gonna hurt Blaire’s brain, but I think I wanna get hired on.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: To provide mystic defense.
Kim: Oh my God, we’re Buzzfeed Unsolved-ing this. Okay.
Rhi: You are. This is really good, yeah.
Josie: [laughs] Yo, what’s up demons?
Rhi: It’s ya girl. Um… actually, I think Myra— cause I feel like that’s, like, the last step of you getting hired. Or maybe all three of you get hired to be occult security if this goes well.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: That is very good.
Josie: Oh yeah, that’s great. We can be a firm.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re a team of occult security specialists. So, I think that then Myra should do a thing first.
Josie: Yes.
Minna: Do they have, like, somebody who’s on watch but not, like, outside?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Can I dress up all spooky and, like, pretend to be a demon just walking down the alleyway?
Kim: Oh Christ.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: You’re giving him a close encounter.
Minna: I wanna be the vibe of something weird caught on the security camera. But there’s no security cameras.
Rhi: Well, there’s… yeah.
Minna: Like, just a weird thing they keep seeing.
Rhi: Yeah. Well, I mean, you could also, like, anybody can Attune to the ghost field, so you could try and do some, like…
Minna: Special effects related to this!
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I wanna dress up and do weird, spooky special effects.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, so they think that you are some kind of spirit.
Minna: I only have two dice, should I push myself? I’m gonna push myself.
Kim: Do you want an assist? Do you want an assist?
Minna: Oh, or that. I’ll take that.
Kim: I will assist.
Rhi: Alright, so Blaire takes a point of stress.
Minna: Blaire gives me makeup tips. [laughs]
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Josie: [laughs] Wow, this is weird to see from the outside.
Minna: 6!
Josie: And then Myra became a cryptid.
Minna: Yes!
Kim: Mothman.
Rhi: Tell me about your spooky ghost demon looks.
Minna: Oh my God. Oh, I need help with this, Kim. And Josie, frankly. The goth and the fashion expert. Or both.
Kim: I probably don’t have enough blood for this, but let’s just go with it. What if we did some really Carrie shit?
Minna: Oh my God. Well, we could mix up something fake, like fake blood.
Kim: Oh yeah. Yeah.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Minx, in preparation for this, is gonna give you an older, lacier dress from when she was still figuring herself out.
Minna: Yes.
Josie: And it’s probably a little too big, so it has, like, low-hanging sleeves and stuff.
Minna: Oh yeah, so you can’t see my hands.
Josie: Yeah, it’s a slightly faded, white, lacy dress that will soon become splattered in blood.
Minna: Uh huh.
Kim: Perfect.
Rhi: Can I just… I just need to take a moment. [laughs] To point out that Kim’s first instinct is to cover Myra in real blood, and that someone is like, “Or we could use fake blood,” and Kim’s like, “Oh yeah, I guess that would work too.”
[laughter]
Rhi: I don’t want that moment to be lost.
[laughter]
Josie: We’re just so used to it.
Kim: Oh my God… [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: I think… so, I think the ghost field portion— well, I think also that Myra’s hair is down and soaking wet to add to that, kind of like, image.
Rhi: Yeah. So, lacy white dress, fake blood, soaking wet.
Minna: And then the ghost field aspect is that her eyes are like, I think it’s like either purple or red situation.
Kim: Mm.
Rhi: Ooh.
Minna: And she leaves footprints in the same weird glowy color that take a few minutes to fade after she goes through.
Rhi: Oh, cool.
Kim: I love it.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Alright.
Minna: It’s like a deep, bruise purple kind of color.
Rhi: Oh, that’s very cool. I’m just picturing Myra, like, coming home after that like, “Guys, it went great!”
Minna and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: Looking like this fucking haunted demon.
Kim (as Blaire): You know, that’s a good look for you.
Minna: You absolutely know that she tested the glowy eye and footprint effect in The Nest while the others watched. So Minx is behind the sofa and Blaire is extremely happy.
Josie: [laughs] Yep.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): And sulk, sulk, heel-ball-change, sulk, and breathe.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh, that’s really good. Alright, Minx, bring us home with our occult security specialists.
Josie: Yeah. We are Spectra and Associates, Occult Security Consulting.
Rhi: Mm hmm. I think that your angle is— because like, you had a bad run with this before where you tried to get somebody to, you know, think their place was haunted and they called the Spirit Wardens. I’m wondering if the angle is like, “No, no, no, if you call the Spirit Wardens, everybody’s gonna know that you have a problem and it’s going to be super obvious. We’re subtle.”
Josie: Right. But I’m also thinking of just outright telling them this is not a normal haunting. This is instigated by a group of criminals. [laughs] Seeking to rob you.
Rhi: Yes!
Minna: “We’ve seen this before.”
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Minna: “The reason you haven’t heard about it is because we fixed it.”
Josie: Exactly. Like, I can’t compete with all the stuff that came before, so all the stuff Myra just said, yes. That’s our angle. Let’s do it. [laughs]
Rhi: That’s so, so good.
Kim: Very good.
Rhi: Oh my God. Okay, yes, make your roll. [laughs] Holy shit.
Josie: Does Blaire have stress to spare on an assist?
Kim: Yes.
Josie: So that I can have suitably authentic mystic mumbo-jumbo?
Kim: Yes.
Josie: 6.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. You all have set this up fucking flawlessly. So, I think that this is actually— this is a deception score.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah, it is.
Rhi: We know the method of deception. So, it’s gonna be a 2d6 engagement roll. And that is a 6.
Josie: Whoa.
Minna: Yeah!
Kim: Nice.
Josie: Whoa! We’ve got, like, three or four of those already.
Rhi: Yeah. You all have… well… you were off to a really strong start on the last score, too.
Josie: [laughs] That is fair.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay. So, I think that we open up on a really nice office within this bank. So, this has marble walls, like, halfway up, and then it’s like a very nice white, clean plaster above that. There are some tasteful paintings hung on the walls. Very nice desk. Comfy, leather-bound chairs in front of it. And sitting behind the desk is the bank manager. Hmm… you know what? I’m gonna crowd-source this. Everybody give me a detail about the bank manager.
Josie: They have… what’s it called? That little cinch-up thing that you often see on, like, “I’m just a southern lawyer,” that little pinch thing with the little tassels coming off of it? Around, like, a dress shirt neck?
Rhi: I know what you’re talking about…
Minna: What do you mean?
Rhi: It’s a…
Minna: A bolo tie?
Rhi: Bolo tie! Yes.
Josie: Yes.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: I was having a crisis because I couldn’t think of what it was called.
Josie: I mean, me neither.
Rhi: Yeah. A bolo tie, okay. Good. [laughs]
Kim: He got here through nepotism.
Rhi: Okay. Good.
Minna: Uh huh.
Kim: So he is incompetent.
Rhi: Good, good.
Minna and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: Bolo tie, incompetent. And?
Minna: I’m just gonna mess around with the aesthetic a little by saying that his hair is very long and up in, like, some elaborate braids.
Rhi: Ooh, okay.
Josie: Oh, huh.
Minna: Just a fun mix of aesthetics. Why not.
Rhi: Yeah, okay. Okay, just because I glanced at your status, I think that his hair is done up in the, like, loopy braids like what Leia has in Cloud City.
Minna: [laughs] Yes!
Kim: Oh, very good.
Minna: For the listening public, my status is “Leia Organa hours are in effect”, which is my default Discord status right now.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yes. So, I think that the bank manager is dressed very fashionably, which means that bolo ties are high fashion in Duskwall.
Minna: Yes!
Josie: Excellent. [laughs]
Rhi: I just, I have to live with that reality now.
Josie: I’m sorry, everyone. [laughs]
Minna: A beautiful reality.
Josie: Minx is tapping with an especially well-manicured finger on a chart that was drawn up beforehand, and saying:
Josie (as Minx): And as you can see, they intend to use a form of inverse portalature to create a vulnerability. Polt and Phasma—
Josie: She points to Myra for “Polt” and “Phasma” is Blaire.
Minna: Yeah! [laughs]
Josie: Because I wanted to be nice to Kim.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: For giving me a Star Wars name? [laughs]
Josie: Yes. [laughs]
Kim: Thank you.
Josie (as Minx): Can create safeguards against this and future such endeavors, but that will take time. I request that we be allowed to observe the premises until such things are installed.
Rhi: I think, yeah, he’s looking at this map that you’ve drawn very intently and is nodding. And like, this whole time, as you’ve been talking to him, explaining the situation, you know, he’s been listening real, like, acting like he’s listening really intently and nodding and looking at everything, but when he asks questions, it’s obvious he has no goddamn clue what you’re talking about.
Josie: Right. Well, to be fair, a lot of people don’t know a lot about mystical shit.
Rhi: Yeah. And also, a lot of what you’re saying is just made up. [laughs]
Josie: Yep. [laughs]
Rhi: But yeah, he’s just like:
Rhi (as Bank Manager): I see… and I… hmm. It’s just, well, normally we would call in the Spirit Wardens for this sort of occult activity, but it sounds like—
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, it is a bit of a gray area. And that is where we come in. Of course, specters and mystical paraphernalia can be confiscated by the Spirit Wardens, but that does nothing to prevent future vulnerability. And it takes time to apprehend these sorts.
Rhi (as Bank Manager): I see.
Rhi: So, I think go ahead and give me a roll.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: You’re in a controlled position to convince this guy.
Josie: 4.
Rhi: So, the bank manager nods again and is like:
Rhi (as Bank Manager): You know, yeah, you’re right. And if the Spirit Wardens are here, people are gonna know there’s a problem and they’re gonna take all their money out. Can’t have that happen again.
Josie (as Minx): Precisely.
Rhi (as Bank Manager): Yes, I believe we can do business.
Rhi: So, he’ll hold his hand out across the desk and shake yours, Minx. And as you’re shaking, he says:
Rhi (as Bank Manager): And of course, my assistant Cyrene will stick with you to make sure that you get anything that you need.
Josie: Of course.
Rhi: So, the complication is that you have a tagalong for the time being.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Until you can lose her.
Josie: I think at this point Minx is gonna look to Polt and Phasma and say:
Josie (as Minx): You two should start on the exterior preparations. I will ensure the interior is set and the staff is properly informed.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispers] I could work on distracting our little stowaway?
Josie (as Minx): [whispers] That was my plan, but if you wish to grab her, go for it.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispers] Oh no, if you got it then…
Josie (as Minx): No, just go for it.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: So, I think that you leave the office and are greeted by a young Severosi woman, dark skin, I think her hair is buzzed kinda short, wearing nice business attire, standing there with a clipboard and pen. I think she’s definitely wearing glasses. And is like:
Rhi (as Cyrene): Uh, hello, I’m Cyrene.
Josie (as Minx): Good evening. I am Spectra.
Rhi (as Cyrene): Nice to meet all of you.
Kim (as Blaire): Phasma.
Minna (as Myra): Polt.
Josie (as Minx): And yes, we know the names. It is branding.
Rhi (as Cyrene): [laughs] Alright, well, um, I am supposed to help you out however I can. I admit I don’t have a lot of experience with sort of spectral things, but, um… I’m excited to learn.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. There’s the actual doing of the protecting of the premises, and then there’s the education part, which is me. I’ll be working with you.
Rhi (as Cyrene): Oh. Um… okay. I may need to get someone else, you’re supposed to have a member of the bank staff accompanying you while you’re doing this work, so—
Kim (as Blaire): You are the member of the bank staff. So, let’s get to it.
Kim: And Blaire just takes her arm and, you know, takes her to a different—
Rhi: Okay. Give me a roll. Cause yeah, she’s… [laughs]
Kim: That’s deception, straight up.
Rhi: Yeah, so that’s gonna be Sway..
Kim: I have one in Sway, so we’ll see how this goes.
Minna: I can assist.
Kim: Thank you. Okay. 6 and 4.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, she’s kind of like:
Rhi (as Cyrene): Oh… okay!
Rhi: And just sort of, like, gets pulled away, off further into the bank.
Josie: [laughs] Blaire can be very insistent.
Rhi: Alright, so yeah. Let’s… let’s actually start with Minx and Myra. What are you two up to with your preparations, plans, whatever it is that you’re trying to do here?
Minna: Oh boy. So, part of it is definitely that I’m, like, making some fake mystical bullshit gestures and look very much like I’m doing things. What I don’t know is what I’m actually doing to help us create vulnerabilities.
Josie: I think maybe we are setting up some various, I don’t know, explosive or other arcane-looking paraphernalia.
Minna: Yeah, okay, I’m definitely setting up, like, fakey bullshit crystal stuff, but it has explosives inside. Do I need to…
Kim: Oh, wow.
Rhi: One of you will need to mark demolition tools. So, I will say in order for you to put them in a place that’s useful you’ll either need to make some kinda roll, for you to have somehow learned the layout of the interior of the bank.
Minna: Can I somehow make that a Consort roll?
Rhi: Yeah, sure.
Minna: I made a friend that gave me a tour.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: That’s a 4.
Rhi: So, I think that what you learned is that the bank vault is not on, like, it doesn’t back up to an exterior wall. Which makes sense for this exact reason. So, the explosives you’re planting are gonna be on, like, a hallway close to the vault. But, you know, still helpful. And that’ll be a one stress flashback.
Minna: Sounds good.
Josie: There were exterior guards, right? Because Myra did that thing. I want to go around to them and ask them, like, where they were seeing the weird phenomena and tell them some fake bullshit with how to deal with it and where to look. Basically, I want them to be ready to tear off or look in the wrong direction if something happens.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, Gimme a roll.
Josie: I’m just gonna keeping Swaying about it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: 5. I got it.
Rhi: I think that you have reduced effect. Like, you know, they hear you out and they listen, but they’re not really— they’re not making as much change to their procedures and where people are stationed as you would hope. And they put a couple extra people there, but they don’t, like, move all of their people over.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Jump back inside to Blaire and her new friend.
Kim (as Blaire): So, a Drowned God is— it could be possible that’s what we’re dealing with here, considering that the sigil on the outside of the building was demonic in nature. However, we cannot rule out a Clouded Wall.
Rhi (as Cyrene): Oh… um… wow. This is all a lot more than I expected to be dealing with. I thought that this was just some ghosts.
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t worry about it, we are here to help. It’s very well possible that it could be ghosts that are very, very clever. And also it could be, as my colleague said, human in nature. Someone trying to impersonate spectral visitation. But, to cover all of our bases, I think that it’s best to start high and then we’ll work our way down, depending on the severity of the threat. So, we are gonna go with this is demonic in nature.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh my God.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Okay, so what is Blaire— is Blaire just trying to keep her distracted?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Or are you trying to get— well, you could also try and get access to parts of the building while you’re here, if you wanted to.
Kim: Ah.
Rhi: She’s just kind of listening to you with really wide eyes, and is like:
Rhi (as Cyrene): Okay. Um, well, where… wow. Demons. Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): it’s really nothing to worry about. We actually have a little bit of experience in dealing with demonic hauntings. So, it’s totally okay.
Rhi (as Cyrene): Oh. I mean, that’s… I guess that’s good to hear. I mean, it’s not good to hear that anyone’s had to deal with demons before, but it’s good to hear that you know what you’re doing. [nervous laugh] Uh, where should we start?
Kim (as Blaire): Show me… show me everything. Give me the lay of the land, show me all your entrances, exits, [mumbles] the vault if you can…
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] Just gonna blitz that in there.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Uh, gimme a roll.
Kim: This is going to be a Sway and I’m going to push myself for it.
Rhi: Okay, you’re still in a controlled position.
Kim: Oh my God, that’s a critical.
Rhi: Shit.
Josie: [laughs] Nice.
Kim: That’s two 6s.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think that, yeah, she gives you a tour of the whole building. She’s going to explain a lot of their already existing security measures.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Including the vault security. There’s a pretty complex lock that requires two keys. It’s that, like, one of them is the bank manager’s and one of them… um…
Kim: We can say the assistant.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, I think that—
Kim: Cyrene could have it.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, I think it’s that the bank manager and Cyrene both have to be present with their keys to unlock the vault, and then there’s also some sparkcraft security on the vault. So, you get a really detailed run-through on how the security on this place works. What do you all wanna do next? Cause you do, you know, have to get into this vault at some point.
Josie: Yup. Can I actually request that Myra and Minx have a moment just passing around the outside of the building?
Rhi: Absolutely.
Minna: Sure.
Rhi: Let’s cut back to that.
Josie (as Minx): So, if she summons her again, what do we do? Is there anything we can do?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know enough about demons to answer that question.
Josie (as Minx): I know they’re not really something that is traditionally killed, not except out of legend or the like.
Minna (as Myra): Well, we’re no legends. Not like that.
Josie (as Minx): Sadly, yes.
Minna (as Myra): If Setarra comes and is threatening us, I think the best we can do is run and try to get Blaire out with us.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose so. But, I mean, even if she is not coming after us, if she appears again and tries to pull Blaire away from us, what do we do? She promised she would choose us over Setarra form here on out, but Setarra won’t like that.
Minna (as Myra): I think we stand there with her.
Josie (as Minx): Alright, Well, that will have to do. And we’ll have to hope that things do not get so bad as needing her.
Minna (as Myra): Let’s not borrow trouble.
Kim (as Blaire): So, show me the outside perimeter, what does that look like, security-wise?
Rhi (as Cyrene): Uh, yes, of course. Right this way…
Josie (as Minx): Oh. I was just about to come find you.
Rhi (as Cyrene): Oh.
Josie (as Minx): What’s the update on the inside?
Kim (as Blaire): Standard security.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Cyrene): I mean… I feel like it’s a little better than standard. We’ve invested quite a lot in our security—
Josie (as Minx): Yes, but we are standing outside, dear. Don’t wanna get too much detail, hmm?
Rhi (as Cyrene): Oh. Oh! Oh, right.
Josie (as Minx): You know what? It may simply be easier for me to take a look for myself. Do be a dear and show her what we are preparing out here.
Kim (as Blaire): So, back to the Clouded Wall. What they’re really known for…
[laughter]
Kim: And I think I just… [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Okay. So, what all is your plan for getting at the vault here?
Josie: I think in the chaos we just need to just jack the keys off these two and go for it.
Rhi: What chaos will that be?
Josie: When the explosives go off, obviously. [laughs]
Rhi: Ah, gotcha. Okay.
Josie: But I think I’m gonna go try and get mine from the bank manager.
Rhi: Okay, I see.
Kim: What do Cyrene— where is Cyrene’s key on her person? What does that look like?
Rhi: On a critical, she would have shown you that.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: She has it a chain around her neck. Like, she kinda keeps it tucked under her shirt.
Kim: I have an idea.
Rhi: Oh no! Yes?
Kim: In order to get the key from Cyrene, I like the idea of Blaire taking a page from Minx’s book and trying to trance powder her.
Rhi: Does Blaire have trance powder on her?
Kim: That would probably be a flashback, wouldn’t it?
Minna: We can use slumber essence.
Kim: Okay, slumber essence works. Um…
Minna: We could do like, we could kinda do a double-team.
Rhi: Yeah. You could do a group action.
Kim: Would this be a group Skirmish?
Rhi: Or Prowl, because she’s not expecting you to attack her.
Kim: I like a group Prowl.
Minna: Yeah. I’m better at Prowl.
Rhi: Yeah, go ahead and make your roll.
Kim: Okay. 3.
Minna: 6.
Rhi: Okay, who was leading that?
Minna: I can lead it. I have stress to spare.
Rhi: Okay. So, you’re gonna take one point of stress, but the result is a 6.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: So, what I’m picturing is that, like, Blaire is still rattling on cheerfully about these forgotten gods and demons and stuff, and turns so that, like, Cyrene is facing her and she has her back to Myra, and Myra just claps the rag over her face. [laughs] And then she falls to the ground.
Kim (as Blaire): I was just getting to the Leviathan Hunters.
Minna (as Myra): Seems like she got a bit bored and fell asleep in class.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): [sighs] Alright fine, let’s get the key and move. I know the way into the vault.
Josie: Blaire’s like, “Can’t relate.”
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi and Minna: [laugh]
Kim: Yeah, no, she can’t.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Alright, so the two of you have your key. Let’s cut back to Minx.
Josie: Is he still up in his office?
Rhi: Yes. I think, like, you knock on the door and he says, “Come in,” and when you do he’s, like, obviously sweeping a game of solitaire off his desk.
Josie: Uh huh.
Rhi (as Bank manager): Ah, Miss Spectra. I hope you have good news for me?
Josie (as Minx): Good news and bad news. The good news is we have prevented the portal from being able to be activated. The bad news is we think there may be an attempt tonight. But we are prepared.
Rhi (as Bank manager): Alright.
Josie: And then I think I’m gonna go for trance powder to the face.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: She’s gonna be like:
Josie (as Minx): Let me go over with you what we just set up.
Josie: So she reaches into her shoulder-padded coat… pocket sand! [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, okay. Go ahead and make that roll.
Josie: Got a 5.
Rhi: Unbeknownst to Minx, this guy does a lot of recreational trance powder.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Oh no!
Kim: Oh noooo!
Rhi: And thus has something of a resistance built up to it. So, you hit him with what should be a pretty strong dose that would, you know, most people that you deal with just get all woozy-eyed. And he’s like, he’s a little spacey, but not as much as he should be. Like, you can’t just search him for the key and go. He’s going to be very aware that you’re doing that. So, he’s like:
Rhi (as Bank manager): Ooh. Huh. You got cheap stuff.
Josie (as Minx): Uh—
Rhi (as Bank manager): I mean, usually I like it if you’re gonna ask first, before giving me some, but…
Josie (as Minx): Apologies. I just figured we might be able to both use this tonight. You have some more?
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: [gasps and laughs]
Josie: I’m trying to like—
Rhi: Give me a roll. Give me a roll!
Josie: I gotta try!
Kim: Oh God.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: If he’s not raising the alarm, I’m not gonna do it. 6.
Rhi: 6?
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: Oh my God.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And then he does the:
Rhi (as Bank manager): Yeah, yeah…
Rhi: He, like, reaches over into his desk and—
Josie: Okay, while he’s leaning down can I just fucking clock him on the back of the head to knock him out?
Rhi: Yeah.
[laughter]
Josie: I feel like this is worth pushing myself on.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: I am gonna start another clock. It’s gonna be a complication. I’m gonna start a clock for somebody finds him. So, yeah. But yeah, he leans down to the drawer and you just— what do you hit him with?
Josie: I think the, like, metal head of my sword cane.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Crack.
Josie: Thwap!
Rhi: And he faceplants onto the floor.
Josie: And I’ll search him for the key.
Rhi: Yes. He keeps his, um… so it’s on a keyring, which initially— like, he has a big keyring in his pocket. Initially you’re like, “aw crap,” and then you take it out and on each of them is pasted a little piece of paper that is labelled with what it’s for.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So you’re just kinda like, “Oh, okay. Vault.” And take that one. Yeah, you both have your keys. Who is responsible for setting off the explosion?
Minna: Me?
Kim: It’s gonna be Minna, I think.
Minna: Yeah, cause I was the one doing it.
Rhi: Yeah. So, that’s gonna be Wreck.
Minna: Oh, I have no Wreck.
Rhi: Well, if you push yourself and get an assist from Blaire, you’ll have 2d6.
Minna: 4.
Rhi: Okay. So, I was gonna say I think that this is gonna be risky, because you are setting off an explosion on a bank. So, you do it. You blow up the back of the bank. So, here are your options for consequences. Either I start another clock for the Bluecoats arriving on the scene. Because, again, you blew a hole in the side of a bank. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Or guards from the bank, like, round the corner just as you do this and see you and are like, rushing you, and you’ll be in a desperate position.
Kim: I don’t like having the Bluecoats on our tails, but at the same time, the switch in position, having us be in a desperate position is also not ideal.
Rhi: You know, if you pick the guards coming around the corner, then you can say “I’m gonna resist that consequence”.
Minna: Yeah. I’ll do that.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: What is the resistance roll?
Rhi: Insight.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: To kinda know where the guards are at, to time this right.
Minna: I rolled a 6.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: No stress.
Rhi: So, yeah, I think you’re about to set off the charge and then you remember, like, having observed the guards outside patrols, and you just wait. And you and Blaire do some, you know, arcane mumbo jumbo at the wall and then once they are far enough away, then you set it off. You blow the hole in the side. So, yeah, the two of you climb into the hole.
Minx, you, I think, leave the bank manager’s office, close the door behind you and start walking, and you get about five steps when you hear a “kaboom!” The people inside the bank react as one would expect when you hear an explosion. The, kind of, a lot of the staff will start to hunker down in place. The guards start moving towards the sound of the explosion. Any kind of customers inside the bank just start running out the front doors.
Josie: Right. Minx is going to do her best to remain calm, pull out a spiritbane charm and brandish it and just start barking orders at the guards like she’s in charge.
Josie (as Minx): Alright, they’re making that move. Remember that alley? You go.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, gimme a roll.
Josie: This sounds like Command.
Rhi: I think it’s gonna be risky.
Josie: I would like to spend two stress to use my Sway instead. Kinda just counting on the false veneer of professionalism here.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, for sure.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. The guards, kind of like, they slow down and like:
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, oh shit! Right! Yeah, okay. Go, go, go!
Rhi: And like, so I think that they’re kind of trying to, like, partly escort customers out but then also move to the position that you have told them about earlier.
Josie: Right. And I think I’ll just calmly walk towards the vault.
Rhi: Okay. I think that you, yeah, you reunite with Blaire and Myra at this big vault door. Yeah, you’ve got the keys. This is gonna be the smoothest goddamn score you’ve ever done. [laughs]
Josie: Uh huh.
Ki: Wow.
Rhi: Yeah. So, you have the keys, you are able to unlock it and you haul the vault door open and it is a big room full of small metal boxes. It’s just like safety deposit boxes.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So yeah, you’re gonna have to— I think what it is, is you’re gonna have to spend some time opening stuff up to find the cash. So, I think I’m gonna have each of you give me some sort of roll to represent you doing that. Gathering the money.
Josie: Maybe a group Survey?
Rhi: Yeah, that could work.
Minna: Yeah, okay.
Rhi: Who will lead?
Kim: I am a bit high on stress, so anybody else?
Minna: I have three to spare.
Kim: Me too.
Josie: Okay. I will lead then, because I have a bit more than that.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: I got a 3.
Kim: I also got a 3.
Rhi: Minna?
Minna: Uh… I dropped it.
[laughter]
Minna: Let’s find a more stable place to roll. 2! Really?
Kim: [gasps]
Josie: Oh no.
Minna: Oh, we’re fucked.
Kim: Oh no…
Josie: Now I only have one stress remaining.
Rhi: Okay…
Minna: You had to say. You had to say it. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: About it being a smooth score.
Rhi: This is on me. I 100% accept the blame for this. I have laid this curse upon your dice.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: You live in the failure?
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] I accept the failure, I live in the failure, I’ll let the failure make me better.
Minna: [through laughter] God, this is not the Campaign podcast.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Do not apologize to JPC for stealing his line. You’re in this vault ripping stuff open, and you suddenly hear from the hallway leading to the vault a lot of running footsteps. And, you know, as you turn to look, you see half a dozen bank guards, weapons readied, and standing in their midst is the familiar figure of Roslyn, who works for the Dimmer Sisters.
Kim: Oh.
Josie: Oh!
Rhi: Who, just as a quick reminder, you framed for murder at the beginning of this season.
Minna: Fuck me.
Josie: Yep, we sure did do that.
Rhi: And Roslyn just sorta looks the three of you over, arches an eyebrow and says:
Rhi (as Roslyn): It’s just as I told you. They will pose as helpers and allies and then turn on you. And I’m afraid that The Magpies have acted as they always do.
Rhi: So. You’re in a desperate situation now.
Josie: Great.
Minna: [whines]
Kim: Fuck!
Rhi: [laughs] You’ve got half a dozen guards.
Josie: I have an idea. [laughs]
Rhi: Uh huh?
Josie: This is a fucking Hail Mary—
Kim: But…
Josie: Hail Mary Sway roll.
Rhi: Mm hmm?
Josie: But… okay. We were gonna frame the Umbra Hunters for this, right? And that’s who we were saying was gonna make a move on the bank?
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Josie: Okay. [laughs] I’m gonna immediately wheel on her and just try to put as much fury in my eyes as possible, which shouldn’t be hard given this situation. But Minx is just gonna be like:
Josie (as Minx): You bitch! You’re the one selling us out to the Umbra Hunters! You’re the one getting behind our defenses. This is ending right now.
Josie: And I’m gonna reach for my gun.
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: Okay, so…
Josie: She’s not exposing us, she’s the double agent trying to get us…
Rhi: Oh, okay!
Josie: Selling us out to the criminals. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. So… okay. Yeah. You weren’t kidding about it being a Hail Mary.
Josie: [laughs] Yeah, I’m just trying to delay.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s gonna be desperate.
Minna: Can I assist?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Josie: Thank you. Cause I do not have stress to push myself.
Rhi: Yeah. Do you want a Devil’s Bargain?
Josie: What does it look like?
Rhi: Um… I think I’m just gonna give you level 1 harm, Panicked.
Josie: Sure.
Rhi: I think that’s gonna give you reduced effect on, I mean, anything where you would need to be kind of calm and focused.
Josie: Okay. I think I will take it.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Wow, that’s a lot of 1s. Fortunately, there’s a 5 in there. If I hadn’t taken the Devil’s Bargain…
Rhi: Yeah, yikes. Okay, you do it but there’s a consequence. This is interesting. So, they believe you, they believe that Roslyn is the one who’s the turncoat or the double agent… but there’s a serious consequence.
Kim: I have an idea for a consequence.
Rhi: Yeah?
Kim: The sigil on the outside of the building could wake up.
Josie: So, it was intended to be fake, but it does something?
Kim: Anyway, yeah.
Minna: I mean, that’s always a risk, because nobody can know everything.
Josie: That’s cool.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I like it.
Josie: I like that one.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, so what is— I mean, what does it do, Kim?
Kim: [giggles] Okay, I like to imagine that, for whatever reason, maybe somebody tampered with it without looking, maybe there’s a little bit of weather outside, something changes the sigil, and… probably not demonic, but probably, I would imagine, something related to a forgotten god.
Rhi: You’re gonna— cause you said you based it on a thing you use to summon Setarra, but not exactly. So, it’s definitely gonna summon something. Cause I feel like, the difficulty with this, like, you do it, is because you also are standing in a vault with crowbarred open safe deposit boxes while holding crowbars.
Josie: [laughs] Right.
Rhi: So, I think that they believe that Roslyn has sold you out. I think that they’re probably not sold on the fact that you’re, like— I think that they’re just like, “no, you’re also still stealing”. So, they’re not, like, they’re kind of returning their attention to Roslyn. They’re not quite sure what to do. And then…
Josie: Tentacles.
Kim: No, I wanna stick with the blood theme. I like the idea of it getting very hot.
Rhi: Oh…
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, there’s these things.
Kim: Uh huh?
Josie: Uh huh…
Minna: Yes?
Rhi: Called Summoned Horrors.
Kim: Oh boy.
Josie: Oh. Great.
Rhi: [laughs] Which are basically things from other realms. So, I think… you used blood… it’s gonna be… okay. So, I think that the guards are confused and kind of looking, like, between you and Roslyn. And guns are kind of, like, some of them are kinda turning their guns on Roslyn, they’re not sure where to go. And then, kind of between your two groups, the wall smashes inward. Just explodes in.
At first, you can’t really like, tell that anything’s there, because there’s a pile of rubble. But then, some of the rock and stone that had fallen when the vault had caved in, or when the wall had caved in, starts to shift and pulls itself up into not a humanoid shape, it’s just sort of a mobile, swirling mass of rock and stone. But instead of being surrounded by dust, it is surrounded by these, like, deep red, very tiny crystals that are kind of glinting in the light. It’s a blood red color, it looks almost like it’s flash-frozen blood. And so, this is now in the room with you. [laughs]
Kim: [giggles] I did this.
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: Yeah, so Minx? [laughs] Once again, some supernatural bullshit is going down.
Josie: I think Minx was wheeled around and pointing at Roslyn, but her eyes just kinda wide and her finger kind of wilts and is like:
Josie (as Minx): [high-pitched] Blaire, what do we do?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know… we can always make friends with it?
Rhi: Minx and Myra. This is horrifying and a little bit brain-breaking, so I am going to need both of you to make Resolve resistance rolls. You can choose to not make the roll, and then you will either freeze up or flee in the face of this.
Josie: I like that Minx just freezes up.
Rhi: Okay. Myra?
Minna: If I get a crit on a Resolve roll, what happens?
Rhi: Oh my God. On a resistance roll? You don’t take— you actually, you take no stress and you clear one stress.
Minna: Nice.
Rhi: Myra see— so this horrible monster made of stone and frozen blood shards bursts through the wall like a demonic Kool-Aid man—
Kim: [laughs]
Josie: Oh yeah!
Minna: [delighted squeal]
Rhi: Minx responds like a normal fucking person and freezes up in terror, Blaire is like, “Oh, that’s cool,” what is Myra’s rationale for not losing her shit here?
Minna: Or in fact gaining back some shit. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, for being like, “Oh, okay. This is fine. I can deal with this.” What’s going on in Myra’s head that’s she’s able to keep her—
Minna: It’s not Setarra.
[laughter]
Minna: This could be helpful.
Kim: The bar is so low!
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: “I’m so glad it’s not Setarra,” and then, “we can use this.”
Rhi: Yeah. I’m gonna make a quick fortune roll to see how everyone else in the doorway reacts. Roslyn, like Blaire, has that sort of iron will thing where she is— she’s startled by this development, but she’s not terrified. The guards, on the other hand, I’m basically making this roll to determine— I said there were six. So, I’m gonna make a roll to find out how many of them just run, and the rest are frozen in shock. I rolled a 6. They all fucking book it.
Kim: Oh my God, yes.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Like, they’re starting to run away, you’ve got this swirling mass of stone and blood shards in front of you, and you have no idea what this thing is going to do. It does not have a humanoid form, it does not have a face, it’s not speaking. You cannot read any sort of intent from it. But it’s here and it’s moving into the space, like into the vault.
Kim: I can talk to it.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. Uh… Blaire?
Kim: For the listeners at home, I have an ability on my character sheet that is Ghost Voice. “You know the secret method to interact with a ghost or demon as if it were a normal human, regardless of how wild or feral it appears.” So, I am going to try Consorting with this fella, and I think I wanna roll first before I see what happens.
Rhi: I think it has to be desperate.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: But you’re gonna be at greater effect.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 3 and a 6.
Rhi: What do you say?
Kim (as Blaire): Hi… I know that you just woke up. And yeah, you’re probably a bit groggy. But these bitches behind me? They’re getting in our way. And I can help you. I can help you get back to wherever it was that you were going. So… deal?
Rhi: So, the swirling stone and blood cloud shifts. Some of the rocks kind of shift around and move. And the cloud of blood crystals sort of stretches out from it and, like swirls around Blaire. And, like, they look like they should be sharp. Blaire, I think you kinda tense up for a second, cause you expect that it’s gonna start cutting into you.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: You know like when you’re in a car and it’s hailing a little bit? It feels the way that that sounds.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: I can kind… I follow.
Rhi: Yeah. So, it’s not painful, but it’s a lot of little, like, boop-boop-boop-boop all over and it’s just kind of like, a little over-stimulating and a little much. So, it does that at you for a second, and then it withdraws the cloud and is gonna rush through the door. And Roslyn sees it coming and also books it. [laughs] And I think that you hear, like, stone smashing into stuff and screaming from down the hall.
Josie: Minx slowly turns her head towards Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): No, Rocky’s a friend.
Josie (as Minx): Oh… okay…. Rocky. You know what? Boxes. Boxes full of money. That’s what I know.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Boxes full of so much money.
Josie (as Minx): Everyone grab some boxes.
Rhi: So, here’s my question. Did somebody arrange for a getaway driver?
Josie: I had a thought that how Myra’s haunting was able to happen earlier is that there was, like, a disused secret passage nearby.
Rhi: You do still have, from way back when you were Shadows, you do still have those underground maps and secret passages and all that.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Exactly, that’s what I was thinking.
Rhi: Yeah. So, in that case, that’s not even gonna be a flashback. You just know where there’s a secret passage. The thing is, so, the amount of gold you can carry is limited by your load. One coin equals one load.
Minna: What if we have, like, a cart down in that secret passage ready?
Rhi: Yeah. So, like, basically if you wanna get— because we had two of you with normal and one of you with heavy. If you want to get, you know, a lot of money, like enough for you to advance in Tier, you would need to make two trips.
Minna: Or could I, like, run and bring the cart while they start bringing stuff?
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, I’ll allow that.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: And I think at this point attention is off of you very thoroughly. [laughs] No one is concerned about what is happening in the vault right now. People are concerned about the blood rock demon rampaging through the bank. So, I’m not gonna make you make any rolls. I think that Myra is able to run and grab the cart. Blaire and Minx, I think that you’re just like, ripping open safe deposit boxes and throwing the boxes in the direction of, you know, the vault door. And then, yeah, you’re able to load up this cart and get out through the hole in the wall that you exploded and get back down into that secret passage. And I think when you do finally leave, it’s like, eerily quiet in the bank.
Josie: Uh huh…
Josie (as Minx): I need to rest.
Josie: So how much coin do we get?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I think… I had four load slots and then if I load that onto the cart and go back for more, I can get eight.
Rhi: You had four. Blaire, did you use any items this time?
Kim: No.
Rhi: Okay, so you have five. So, if you did two trips, you could get ten coin.
Kim: Okay. Woah.
Rhi: Myra, how many free load slots did you have left?
Minna: Four load slots.
Rhi: So, eight plus eight is… so 26 coin.
Josie: Isn’t that as much as we need to level up?
Rhi: It is. However—
Kim: It’s more than enough.
Josie: Well, how much do we need to pay off the Bluecoats?
Rhi: Cause you all are at Wanted level 3. I think it’s gonna be a question of how many Wanted levels you wanna drop. I’m gonna say that to drop one Wanted level is four coin, to drop two Wanted levels is six coin.
Josie: Here’s the thing, for levelling up, I can fill in the gap. I think we should just drop a full two Wanted levels, and then I can give six coin to us levelling up.
Rhi: You’ll just cash out twelve points of stash?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: So, is that— does that sound good to everybody? Is that what you wanna do?
Kim: That works for me, yeah.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Weren’t we going to give some to Lani and Roxanne to get their printing press?
Minna: Yes! I wanna do that.
Josie: So, we’re not levelling up? [laughs]
Rhi: No, you still can. Okay, so let me… um…
Rhi (as Narration): Six minutes of complex and boring math later.
Rhi: Yeah, so between the score, what Minx can contribute, and the vault, we were at 47. You lose 16 coin for your bribe and the printing press, and then another 24 to level up.
Josie: So, we can put… how much do we wanna put back in the vault from this seven?
Kim: I was gonna say, do we wanna put the whole seven in the vault?
Rhi: Or you could divvy it up, each of you takes two coin and you put one in the vault.
Josie: Yeah, let’s do that.
Minna: Okay.
Kim: I’m down with that.
Rhi: Alright, and I have officially updated your crew sheet.
Minna: We levelled up and we bought a printing press and we bribed people! This is amazing.
Rhi: Actually, yeah, this is a lot. So, for the printing press, I am gonna treat that as gaining a—
Minna: Turf.
Rhi: Yeah, a piece of turf. A claim, that’s what they’re called. So, Hagen’s clinic, I don’t think I said this last time, Hagen’s clinic counted as a piece of turf.
Minna: Publicity. I think it’s the publicity square.
Rhi: Yeah. For the printing press. So, yeah. Basically, you’ve got people in your corner now who are gonna say nice things about you when you take down criminals or rich people. Alright, so let’s get into your downtime stuff. Myra, let’s start with you.
Minna: I am going to go take over the bribe money to the Bluecoats.
Rhi: [laughs] You’re just gonna roll up, a Wanted criminal, into a Bluecoat station with just a satchel full of money.
Minna: I assume I’m let in through a side door by the guy I’ve bene talking to.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] I think that it’s like a storage closet next to the break room, cause the break room has too many witnesses.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: He walks you, like, back into there. You have over the money. He does count it out and is like:
Rhi (as Bluecoat): Alright. This is more than enough to lose some files. Pleasure doing business with you.
Minna (as Myra): Of course.
Rhi: And then will head out. And I think then you step out of this storage closet, preparing to go back out that side door.
Minna: Mm hmm…
Rhi: You turn to walk towards the exit and there is a crash as a coffee mug hits the floor, which Jeren has just dropped.
Minna: [laughs] Is this his usual station or is he, like, floating between—
Rhi: It’s not. It’s not his usual station.
Minna: Cause I wouldn’t have just rolled up there casually.
Rhi: No. No. Its not where he usually works. So, like, you’re just as shocked to see him as he is to see you. So, I think there’s like a long pause.
Minna: Myra, like, steadies herself on the wall slightly.
Minna (as Myra): Hello…
Rhi (as Jeren): What are you… what are you doing here?
Minna (as Myra): I really don’t think you wanna know that, but maybe we should talk somewhere more privately?
Rhi (as Jeren): [sighs]
Minna (as Myra): She nods her head towards the storage closet she just came out of. [laughs]
Rhi: He, like, glances around, looks down at the coffee mug, just like, throws his hands up in the air in exasperation and then will, like, angrily march into the storage closet.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Myra follows and closes it quietly behind them.
Rhi (as Jeren): What— why— [sighs] right. You said I didn’t wanna know. Not that that’s ever helped.
Minna (as Myra): Do you… I mean, do you wanna know? I will tell you. But it’s up to you.
Rhi (as Jeren): You know what? Yeah, I think I do.
Minna (as Myra): One of your colleagues takes bribes for losing files. I know that makes your job tougher and I’m sorry, but…
Rhi (as Jeren): Great. Yeah. Well. I don’t know if I wanted to know, I don’t know if I feel any better.
Minna (as Myra): None of this is ever gonna feel better. I’m sorry.
Rhi: I think you kind of notice that he’s— the way he’s standing, he’s keeping his weight primarily on one leg. He didn’t really seem to be limping when he was walking, but he seems to be a little bit favoring, like, his left leg.
Minna: I think Myra’s eyes visibly fall to that and then she, kinda like, swallows.
Minna (as Myra): How’s the recovery?
Rhi (as Jeren): Well, you caught me on my first week back from medical leave, that’s why I’m here. Have somebody filling in my old post and they’re sort of floating me around for a bit until they can find me a permanent place. This is a little closer to home anyway, so…
Minna (as Myra): Less walking.
Rhi (as Jeren): Trying to make it easier on me getting to work.
Minna (as Myra): For the record, I’m sorry.
Rhi: He shrugs and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, I know you are. [sighs] It just, that doesn’t really, uh… that doesn’t fix it.
Minna (as Myra): I know. Sorry never fixes it.
Rhi (as Jeren): I probably need to get back to my desk. But it’s good to see that you’re doing okay.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. It’s really good to see that, too. I mean— you know what I mean.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. Yeah, I know. Look, um, be careful. Alright?
Minna (as Myra): You too.
Minna: I think she, like, catches his arm lightly.
Rhi: He will stop.
Minna (as Myra): You know where to reach me if you need me. Or want to talk.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah, I know.
Rhi: He nods and will open the door and slip back out, and then head off down the hall.
Minna: Big sigh.
Rhi: And then she’s gonna head out?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: I think we kind of like, I’m picturing sort of a big panning shot across Duskwall from this station, this Bluecoat station, over to… where do we find Minx?
Josie: I think she’s just entering The Hound’s Paw to collect some mail.
Rhi: Do you wanna, like, real quick for the listeners, explain what she’s been doing for the last…?
Josie: Oh right, yeah. Minx gets home after the score and is just:
Josie (as Minx): I can’t wrap my brain around what just happened. I’m going to sleep in my room, read trashy romance novels until things seem normal again.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: So, she does. And now she’s feeling a little bit better.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx has decided that her first venture outside after her romance novel and nap recovery period is to get the mail. I think you all usually time your mail pickups for times when the bar isn’t super crowded, so there’s only a handful of people here. And Rigney will, kind of, you know, give you a quick nod. I think he looks a little surprised to see that you’re the one coming in picking up the mail. I don’t think that Minx has done this for a while. And kind of is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): I’ll get your notes. There was somebody here asking for you, specifically.
Josie (as Minx): Oh?
Rhi: And he points to the end of the bar, where there is a young woman, very pale skin, white-blond hair, fairly nice clothes. And she’s just kinda got her arms resting on the bar. There is an untouched cup of tea in front of her. And I think when Rigney says, you know, “somebody was asking for you,” she glances down and also kinda like, you know, looks you over. Because she also has never met you. She just knows you by reputation.
Rhi (as Woman): Minx, right?
Josie (as Minx): Uh… yes, dear. And who am I talking to?
Rhi: (as Woman): My name’s Clave. I’m an old… associate of Myra’s.
Josie (as Minx): I see. So, is this the venue we should be talking in, then?
Rhi (as Clave): Well… I’m led to understand that you do a lot of your business here, and I would like to talk business.
Josie: Minx will slowly step over to where Clave is sitting, plop the mail on the bar and politely sit.
Rhi (as Clave): I don’t know if Myra has told you much about me. If she has, I’m sure it’s not very flattering.
Josie (as Minx): Accurate.
Rhi (as Clave): [dry laugh] I suppose I should just get straight to the point. I want Salia dead and I can’t do it on my own.
Josie (as Minx): [laughs] Huh, funny. I was turning that exact same though over in my head the other day.
Rhi (as Clave): Yeah. Well, she sent Ojal after all of you. I guess… well, I saw the state that it came back in and… good job, I guess.
Josie (as Minx): It takes a bit more than that to get at us.
Rhi (as Clave): I, um… Ojal was very loyal. And she got run over by a Bluecoat carriage, and I saw what that loyalty gets a person. It gets you a slow death and your soul stuck in a crystal and…
Rhi: And her eyes kinda unfocus and, like, she sorta looks haunted.
Rhi (as Clave): If that’s what sticking around gets me, I don’t want it. And I don’t want to end up in Myra’s position either, where she’s hunting me across the city. So, I want her dead. And I need your help.
Josie (as Minx): We were already planning to do what you are asking of us.
Rhi (as Clave): Ah.
Josie (as Minx): There is no other option with a person like Salia.
Rhi (as Clave): [sighs]
Josie (as Minx): I know how hard it can be to prove good faith, so I am going to choose to believe you here, because I can’t think of many more worthy causes than sticking it Salia at the moment. But if this is a deception to get in and betray us, even if that is not your intent now, if you think you may reconsider us later, now is your chance to leave. Go back to Salia and tell her it was a bust.
Rhi (as Clave): And what happens if I do betray you? You know, same page, cards on the table, et cetera?
Josie: She’ll kind of pull up her cane a little bit.
Josie (as Minx): Then I clean you off this blade. Simple, no?
Rhi (as Clave): And probably better than what Salia would do to me if she knew about this conversation, so I’ll take my chances with you.
Josie (as Minx): Alright then. Do you have a place to stay?
Rhi (as Clave): I mean, I’m not… if I leave, she knows something’s wrong. If I stay, she doesn’t have cause to suspect me as well. And I can get you information, tell you about what she’s up to and her new friends.
Josie (as Minx): That sounds fine. And I take it we will be pulling our punches should we meet in more direct fashion?
Rhi (as Clave): I’d appreciate it, but you know, also, we’ll have to make it look convincing, right?
Josie (as Minx): Right. And you know I will have to tell Blaire and Myra about this?
Rhi (as Clave): Tell them what you like, just… there’s a reason I came to you and not to Myra.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, I imagine there are conversations that need to be had.
Rhi (as Clave): Eh, I’m perfectly fine working with you.
Josie (as Minx): Well, it’ll have to do. Are you gonna finish your tea, or do you need a drink?
Rhi: She kinda looks down at the tea like she forgot it was there and is like:
Rhi (as Clave): Uh…
Josie (as Minx): Rigney! All is forgiven if there are two free over here right now!
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, if that’s all it took…
Josie and Rhi: [laugh]
Rhi: I think he kinda winks at you and brings over two shots of something. She’ll throw back her shot.
Josie (as Minx): Well, if we’re going to be doing business, we need to have business drinks.
Rhi (as Clave): Heh. Right.
Rhi: Let’s jump over then to… Blaire.
Kim: To clear Blaire’s stress, she is going to go and catch up with The Reconciled and share her progress with her long-term project of recovering ghosts that were in the process of being turned into drugs.
Rhi: Yes. So, you make your way over to the hidden Reconciled base that you know of, knock on the door and you are let in by Lady Karina, who kinda looks a little surprised to see you and is like:
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Ah. Blaire. I don’t recall sending for you…
Kim (as Blaire): House visit. I wasn’t summoned.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Ah.
Rhi: And I think there’s— I don’t think Blaire picks up on it necessarily, but there’s a look of, like, “Oh God…” because I think Blaire will occasionally just drop by to ramble on at them, and The Reconciled have varying levels of patience for dealing with it.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, I think there’s a like a brief moment of, “Oh no,” and then she’s like:
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Oh, oh that’s— you know, that’s wonderful. Tira, the young woman that you sent to us, or you brought to us recently, she’s been asking after you.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, she remembers!
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Would you like to see her?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, thank you.
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Yes, we’ve been doing some work with her to try and help her keep herself together and progress has been slow, but I think we have been making some.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s great to hear, thank you.
Rhi: And so I think she kinda leads you through, like, the main room where you normally are, back down a little bit deeper into this space. It’s still all very nice. For some of them, there are private bedrooms because they have, like, bodies that they are possessing.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: But then there is kind of a, like, a ghost room where the unbodied spirits hang out. For a lot of these ghosts, they have items that belonged to them in life, that they kind of use as anchor points. So, they don’t have their own room, but they have a shelf that has some of their stuff on it that sort of helps them maintain their memories and stuff. And so, I think you head in there and immediately Tira kind of wooshes over to you and materializes as she does so and is like:
Rhi (as Tira): Oh! Uh, Blaire, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes! Yes, I’m so glad you’re remembering.
Rhi (as Tira): Yes.
Rhi: And Karina is like:
Rhi (as Lady Karina): Alright, well you two have fun catching up.
Rhi: And then leaves. [laughs]
Kim: Obviously.
Rhi: She’s just like, “I don’t wanna—” Yeah.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh, thank you for bring me here. These people are… some of them are a little weird, uh, but they’ve been really helpful. Some of them went back to my dorm and they found some of my stuff.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah, look, look. I got a whole shelf all to myself!
Rhi: And she points at the shelf that has, like, some books and notebooks and I think there’s, like, a pair of goggles, like safety goggles. And then just some little, like, scraps of fabric and…
Kim (as Blaire): Notes and…
Rhi: A lot of very like, sentimental things.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah, it took me a while to remember where I went to school and where I lived, but they were able to get some of my stuff and that kinda helped.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s so good!
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. It’s… I kinda miss being able to go out a lot, but they’re worried that if I spend too much time out in the city that I’m gonna sorta start getting all, ooooh, weird in the head again. So, for now, I’m just kinda staying here. But I’m feeling better.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s so good. I was really worried.
Rhi (as Tira): Aww. Thanks. It’s nice to have people that worry.
Kim (as Blaire): I’d hug you if I could.
Rhi: Looks very thoughtful.
Rhi (as Tira): They keep offering to find me a body, but I think it’d have to be a dead one or I’d have to take it from somebody else, and I feel kinda weird about both of those options.
Kim (as Blaire): Well… not even a dead body that was, I dunno, died naturally or humanely?
Rhi (as Tira): I mean, yeah, just like… it wouldn’t be me, right? It wouldn’t be my body.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, nothing would be your body. Your body’s gone.
Rhi (as Tira): I know. And so, it would feel weird.
Kim (as Blaire): I get it.
Rhi (as Tira): I dunno. I mean, I’ve got a really long time to decide, cause I’m dead, right?
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs]
Rhi (as Tira): I’m not gonna get older. I’m gonna be around forever. Probably.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs] Yes, that’s true. You have all the time in the world now.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. So, what have you been up to?
Rhi: And she, like, moves like she’s gonna sit and then kinda realizes that’s not a thing, and so just sorta like stands there swinging her arms.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, I’m working on a research project. I really don’t like spirit drugs, so I’m work—
Rhi (as Tira): I mean, I don’t either.
Kim (as Blaire): I know.
Rhi (as Tira): That’s messed up!
Kim (as Blaire): It’s really messed up. So, I’m working on something on how to undo that.
Rhi (as Tira): How to undo it? What do you mean?
Kim (as Blaire): How to save a ghost that’s been turned into drugs.
Rhi (as Tira): Oh… if you could do that, that would be, like, that would be wild.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m working on it. But uh…
Rhi (as Tira): Whoa…
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I don’t want this to keep on happening.
Rhi (as Tira): Yeah. Huh. I wonder what it’d be like to talk to somebody who’s been drugs. Like, I’ve talked to people who’ve been on drugs, but I haven’t talked to somebody who’s been drugs.
Kim (as Blaire): I imagine that they’re probably dealing with a lot of trauma, so…
Rhi (as Tira): Oh yeah, I guess that’s true.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. It’d probably be tough. They’d probably need a lot of time to recover.
Rhi (as Tira): We’d need to find some of their stuff. Finding stuff helps.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi (as Tira): Alright, so tell me about the research.
Rhi: And I think that we’ll probably fade out on you two getting into, like, really deep alchemical nerdery.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, we will end with, actually, a little bit of a flashback. So, while Minx was still hiding in her room napping and recovering from seeing a horrible blood stone monster from beyond the veil, Myra and Blaire made their way across town up to the docks to a familiar small apartment, ring the doorbell and there’s a bright flash from under the doorframe. And after a moment, the door swings open and Lani is standing there. And she looks very surprised to see you and then smiles and waves and will kind of half-turn back into the apartment and sign something, and then Roxanne comes over. Is like:
Rhi (as Roxanne): Oh, hi! Wow, it’s been a while. What’s going on?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. We have some good news, for a change.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Oh!
Kim (as Blaire): We have something we’d like to give you.
Rhi (as Roxanne): Oh, okay. Yeah, come on in.
Minna (as Myra): So, we have…
Minna: She pulls out from like an inner pocket somewhere a clinking bag of coin.
Minna (as Myra): This for you, with which to purchase— well, I suppose you can use it for whatever you want, but I would suggest the purchase of a printing press. It should be enough.
Rhi: Roxanne, like, takes the money and is just, like, staring at it. And they sign back and forth to each other very fast. Lani signs, like:
Rhi (as Lani): We’re not gonna ask where you got this. But thank you so much.
Rhi: And then she’s gonna go and give you each a big hug.
Kim: Aww.
Minna: [happy purr]
Rhi: And then Roxanne gives you hugs. But yeah, I think that they promise that they will do their best to make sure that people understand the good work that you are actually doing in the city.

##Blooper [01.29.35]
Rhi: Oh my goodness. I just saw the picture of Raja you posted on Twitter.
Kim: Raja?
Minna: He is lying directly behind my computer being a cutie.
Kim: I wanna see…
Rhi: What a good soft boy.
Minna: It’s on Twitter.
Kim: I’m going. I’m going.
Rhi: Look at that face.
Minna: The caption, “Help me…”
Rhi: This is probably gonna be in the blooper reel or the stinger.
Minna: What?
Rhi: Because we’re still recording.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: Oh, Raja!
Rhi: He’s so cute.
Kim: So tired.
Minna: He’s a soft sleepy boy and he was very mad when I moved my bed because I wanted to sit against my pillow, which he’s been lying on all day.
Kim: How dare you?
Rhi: How could you? That’s his pillow.
Minna: I just sat up against him, I didn’t tell him to leave. But he was like, “Fuck you,” and moved.
Kim: Ca you boop his snoot?
Minna: You want me to boop his snoot for you?
Kim: Yay!
Minna: Oh, he woke up, eek! And now he’s sniffing my finger, it’s very cute. Aww, rubbing his face on my finger.
Rhi and Kim: Aww…
Minna: You get scritches for that."
"Season 3, Episode 11: The Inside Job Score Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us.
We have nearly 1,000 followers on Twitter, which is honestly kind of mind-blowing. The Magpies fan community just keeps growing and it’s because all of you wonderful people leave reviews and live-tweet new episodes and tell your friends about the show. If you’d like to support us financially and help us do more awesome things, check out our Patreon or our Shapeways store to get your very own, very cool Magpies pin.
The Descent into Midnight Kickstarter is still going. I am the Accessibility Consultant on the project, and last weekend we posted the Screen Reader Friendly versions of the quick start materials. I’m really proud of the work we’ve done to make this game accessible so far, and we are planning on doing so much more.
Descent into Midnight is a really fun, creative, emotional game, and we’re working our way through the stretch goals right now. The more we unlock the more stories will be told with this game, as most of the remaining stretch goals are about streamed episodes of an actual play or written fiction inspired by the games themes. So, if you haven’t yet, go check it out and consider backing before the Kickstarter ends on March 15.
Next, Minna is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Minna: This month’s Featured Charity is the League of Women Voters. They have a mission to empower voters and defend democracy by working to expand voter access and fight voter suppression. They provide election guides and information for voters and help them register to vote. If you’d like to donate they can be found at lwv.org.
Rhi: Today is Super Tuesday in the United States, meaning that in our painfully long and increasingly bizarre election cycle a whole bunch of states are holding their primaries today. If you haven’t voted yet, pause the episode and go do that… unless you’re listening to this episode on your way to your polling place, in which case carry on.
Voting cannot and should not be the end, though. There’s so much more to do before the November election. Local elections are of critical importance as are House and Senate races, and above all that is the necessity of protecting and expanding voting rights. Look for opportunities to help in your area, many of which can be done from your home or meeting up with friends, writing letters, making calls, or sending texts. Making sure as many people as possible can vote is one of the best ways to turn back the tide of fascism and hate flowing out of our current government.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:03:00]
Rhi: We open up on a small apartment building in Crow’s Foot. It’s the nicer area of an overall not great district, sort of a quieter residential area. We move inside one of these apartments. It’s very minimalist I suppose would be the word, pretty sparse in terms of decoration. The furniture and things that are in here are all pretty… more utilitarian than anything. Cinematically, the camera kind of moves into a small, dark bedroom where someone is sleeping in a bed. There’s a creaking sound outside the apartment, and this person sits upright, gun in his hand, and we can see that it is one Bazso Baz.
He has pulled a gun out from under his pillow and is looking around, slides out of bed, makes his way across the apartment and listens at the front door. He raps out a beat on the door, and then waits a couple seconds, and he seems to be waiting for a response that doesn’t come, so he unlocks the door and then does that thing where he yanks it open and sort of lunges out into the hallway very quickly, gun first.
He sees, as he’s looking around, there are two bodies on the floor dressed sort of the way that the Lampblacks usually are, boots and bracers type look. There were chairs outside in the hall that they were apparently sitting on and they have fallen out of them onto the floor. He kneels down to check the pulse of one of them and then curses under his breath and straightens up, and as he straightens up a blade is laid across his throat.
Kim: Oh…
Rhi: Bazso seems less alarmed by this than by his dead guards. He immediately grabs the wrist, twists it around, there’s sort of a popping sound, spins around and, without really looking, fires… and the person holding the knife collapses to the floor clutching at their stomach, already bleeding out. As he turns, a knife comes flying down the hallway at him, thrown by someone else. He manages to twist so that he catches it more in the shoulder than in the heart, where it was aimed, but he cries out in pain when it impacts his shoulder and he looks up just as the person who threw the knife disappears around the corner, so leaving him in his apartment hallway with a knife in his shoulder and three dead bodies. So he’s not having the best night ever.
Josie: [sympathetic groan]
Rhi: And from there… Myra, you got a note written in handwriting that you did not recognize—it’s not Jeren, for sure—asking to meet you at this café.
Minna: Interesting.
Rhi: It wasn’t signed. It was just a note saying…
Minna: This is the basically Panera I usually meet Jeren at though, correct?
Rhi: …
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Son of a bitch. You all did make it a Panera, didn’t you?
[laughter and clapping]
Minna: [smiling] I’m just making sure that it’s the same café.
Rhi: Yeah~
Kim: Bread bowls, baby!
Minna: It doesn’t have to be a Panera, but that’s what we call it.
Rhi: Yeah~ Yeah, it’s that place…
Minna: [giggles]
Kim: Getting some microwave macaroni and cheese.
Rhi: [reluctantly delighted] Oh no… [coughs laughing] Yeah, you’d gotten this note asking, someone asking to meet you here. What do you do?
Minna: Um…
Rhi: It does specifically ask for you to come alone.
Minna: Yeah, I mean, that is a red flag. I’m definitely going to show the note to Blaire and Minx.
Josie (as Minx): So… why are you meeting with Bazso Baz?
Minna (as Myra): Is that his handwriting that is?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. It’s too clean to be anyone else.
Rhi: [chuckles]
Kim (as Blaire): Bazso Baz, that guy who caught us spying on him and breaking into his place, Bazso Baz?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah…
Josie (as Minx): Precisely.
Kim (as Blaire): Huh…
Minna (as Myra): He says come alone, as you can see.
Josie (as Minx): An ambush of this fashion does not seem to be Bazso’s style. He does prefer upfront business dealings.
Rhi: And if he was gonna ambush you it wouldn’t be in Nightmarket. That’s really far away from his turf.
Minna: That’s our turf, not his.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. He is coming to your place of business.
Minna: Yeah, he’s almost setting it up as like, yeah, that seems like a thing that he would do trying to make it seem like it’s on the up and up.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. No doubt he has an ulterior motive to whatever he says, but…
Minna (as Myra): It’s a gesture of faith, sort of. Good faith, rather.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. I think we can trust that you will be safe at the café.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. I do think I’m going to go meet him. We’re not on the best of terms, but I’m definitely interested to hear what he has to say if this is the trouble he’s gone to.
Josie (as Minx): Would you like us to observe from a distance?
Minna (as Myra): No. I think… You’ll know if something happens, because you know the time and the place and when I’m expected back.
Kim (as Blaire): But will we know too late? I don’t think this is a good idea, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): He asked—
Rhi: You did get kidnapped, a little bit, last time. [laughs]
Minna: Yeah…
Minna (as Myra): He’s in good faith coming here. I think that if we show this much distrust it might scare him off. It just depends how much we’re willing to risk in order to get his good favor and how much we want that good favor in the first place.
Josie (as Minx): Eh…
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I think we should have someone watching just in case. Perhaps neither of us, perhaps a friend of ours.
Minna (as Myra): I’m more comfortable with that.
Kim (as Blaire): Who can we send?
Josie (as Minx): Maybe we could just pay a cabbie to chill across the street for a moment?
Kim (as Blaire): Or we could get Kay.
Josie (as Minx): Or we could get Kay, although were something to happen she may just outright kill Bazso Baz, which…
Minna (as Myra): That’s not a bad idea to have in our back pocket.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): I mean, you want me to have backup, right?
Rhi: Yeah, Kay is… backup.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. [laughs] You know what, let’s ask Kay if she is willing to stand outside the café for about half an hour.
Rhi: [laughing] I think there’s just a quick cut to the three of you standing on some dock in the canals and Kay being like:
Rhi (as Kay): Hell yeah!
[laughter]
Rhi: Cut to the café. [laughs] Kay is I think hanging out at a, uh, there’s like a news stand across the street that she’s hanging out at, perusing the papers and pamphlets and such. She’s gotten something to snack on from this café, standing over there, because she wanted to come in and get a lay of the land. Which chairs can I pick up and throw?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: That sort of thing. So yeah, Kay is not immediately across the street but close enough that if you yell she will be there in about ten seconds. So yeah, how early do you get there?
Minna: I’m gonna say 15 minutes.
Rhi: Okay. When you walk in Bazso is already there.
Minna: Oh boy. Oh boy. He’s Myra but worse.
Rhi: [laughs] And he is at your usual table but he’s sitting in your usual spot.
Minna: [smiling] He’s in my spot.
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: Myra does not let on that this is slightly frustrating to her. She just calmly settles into the spot left for her. How does he know that’s my table? [giggles] How does he know this is my café?
Rhi: He knows it’s your café because he has sources.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: He doesn’t know it’s your table, he just did the same—
Minna: Got lucky.
Rhi: No, he did the same assessment of the place that you did.
Minna: Fuck!
Rhi: Which is oh, this is the one that gives me the clearest sightlines to all the windows and exits.
Minna: Fuck me!
Kim: Ohh…
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Therefore I will take this seat.
Minna: Why is Bazso a direct attack?
Kim: “Listen here, hero. We’re not so different you and me.”
[laughter]
Rhi: I mean… So yeah, you sit down and he kinda nods at you.
Rhi (as Bazso): I expected you to get here a bit earlier. They got good tea at least.
Rhi: He picks up the mug of tea, but he picks it up in his off hand and will sip at it.
Rhi (as Bazso): So, I guess at the top I should ask this. You haven’t sent anybody to try to kill me recently, have you?
Minna (as Myra): You haven’t done anything recently that warrants it more than usual, have you?
Rhi (as Bazso): Not that I can think of.
Minna (as Myra): Then there’s your answer. We’re not irrational.
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, I figured I should clarify that before I ask what I’m going to ask. Somebody killed my guards and sent people who were, I assume, trying to kill me, and I am pretty sure it’s somebody in my gang.
Minna (as Myra): Somebody in your gang?
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah. There have been some complaints lately about how I’ve been running things. People don’t like that I’m in the Docks. Quite frankly, I’m starting to lose interest in the Docks, however I know that you and Ellie and the weird little one—
Minna (as Myra): You know she goes by Minx now, right?
Rhi: He shrugs and then winces a little bit.
Rhi (as Bazso): I know that the three of you have some kind of beef with the Circle of Flame and I know that you need me to hold the Docks on your behalf.
Minna (as Myra): [chuckles] On our behalf?
Rhi (as Bazso): Well you sure as hell don’t have the manpower to hold it. That’s why you got me involved, right? Your whole stunt with the ghosts and all those downtrodden refugees.
Minna (as Myra): We didn’t get you involved to disrupt all civilian life in the Docks. Last time I was there it did not look like a place where anybody was happy, not you and not them.
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, if you don’t care if Lord what’s-his-name moves in and takes that territory and builds that factory of his, then that’s fine, I can just walk out of here and go hire a private eye.
Minna (as Myra): Do you have any suspects, or is it that everybody in your gang wants to kill you now?
Rhi (as Bazso): Most of them are still loyal, but there’s been grumbling, and if somebody else takes over they’re going to walk away from the Docks. I think that I can turn this around. I think I can still profit there. Whatever gang there, the Umbra Hunters, haven’t been as organized of late. If I just get more time I can solidify my hold there, but there’s people in my organization who are no longer willing to give me that time. So, I need you and the other two to figure out who’s leading this would-be coup and bring them to me, so I can deal with them.
Minna (as Myra): I’m gonna need a list of the people you think are the most suspicious and also the people who have the most friends among your gang.
Rhi: So, he tells you. I think just to keep things focused and useful you basically end up with three names of interest. The first is a woman named Constance Cora. She is already dead. She was one of his lieutenants who very publically called him out about his dealings in the Docks. He responded by sending her and her gang to the Docks where she got killed in a rival gang shoot-out, however some of her people may be holding a grudge about that. Some of her friends might be. Constance herself, unlikely to have committed the crime seeing as she’s been dead for a few weeks, but some of her people maybe.
There’s also another Lampblack lieutenant named Andre Rowe. He also raised some concerns to Bazso, although he did that in private, but it did turn into a bit of a heated argument, and Andre went missing not long after Constance was killed. The third name you get is Rado Viktorov. The Lampblacks’ main business—well, their two main criminal enterprises are cheap drug dens and street toughs, will beat people up for money. Rado Viktorov runs one of the drug dens in Crow’s Foot, specifically he runs the one closest to Bazso’s apartment and Bazso’s guards tend to be pulled from the enforcers of his place.
He will kind of describe what happened when he was attacked, what he saw, and it looks like his guards may have pre-gamed their work shift a little bit, which is not uncommon for his people. They had gone to Rado’s place, taken some drugs, a couple hours later they were dead, apparently of poison, so he’s suspicious about that.
So those are the names that you get as your starting leads. Bazso will also tell you that, in his opinion, the best way to approach this is that, since you know, it’s a pretty well-known fact amongst the Lampblacks that they don’t get along with the magpies, that if you start coming around asking about people trying to kill Bazso maybe they’ll assume that you also want him dead. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: But yeah, he basically says that you all need to find the people responsible, bring them in, if possible he wants them brought to him alive, and in exchange he will continue to hold the Docks as opposed to just doing what most of his gang wants and bail on it. Anything else that Myra wants to ask or say at this point?
Minna: I think she… Like, Bazso generally keeps—Oh no, did he keep his word after the riot?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah, pretty much.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s why he’s in the Docks.
Minna: Yeah. I just don’t personally like the way that he’s doing it, we don’t personally like the way he’s doing it, but he kept his word.
Rhi: Right.
Minna: We did kind of replace one asshole with a different brand of asshole, but he’s slightly the lesser of two evils. [chuckles]
Rhi: Yeah. [chuckles] The thing is, if a single gang holds a territory that territory tends not to see a ton of violence, because there’s not a lot of fighting happening within it.
Minna: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Rhi: So, he’s not entirely wrong in saying that if he can just get the Docks locked down, or his section of the Docks, things will probably get better.
Minna: Yeah. Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): It sounds like we have a deal.
Rhi (as Bazso): Wonderful.
Rhi: Again, he starts to reach out with his right hand, stops, puts his hand back down, and then holds out his left to shake.
Minna (as Myra): Do you need a healer?
Rhi (as Bazso): I’ll be fine.
Minna (as Myra): You sure about that? We’ve got one at our disposal.
Rhi (as Bazso): I’ll be fine.
Minna (as Myra): Try not to get killed before we find the person who did this.
Rhi (as Bazso): Try to find them quick.
Rhi: So, we wanna hop back to The Nest so Myra can…?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. I think we come in on the end of Myra explaining all of this.
Josie (as Minx): All right. Before we start planning, I have something very important to do.
Josie: Minx will go to her room, open the door, and before it shuts behind her she emerges in a new outfit.
Kim: Oh, I thought she was gonna—
[laughter]
Josie: For the listeners at home, it’s about as stereotypical s Sherlock Holmes outfit you could get.
Minna: It’s a deer stalker.
Josie: Complete with the deer stalker and the pipe, but of course, since this is Minx, the coat is cinched in at the waist and has a skirt instead of trousers, and thigh-highs.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Now then, my dear Myra, what shall we do?
Kim: See, I thought Minx was gonna go to her room and just scream, but this is much better.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I also love that we have now two Sherlock Holmes in the party. I realized the other day that Myra is basically a Sherlock Holmes expy.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. It’s very good.
Josie: Yes, but I have the aesthetic.
Rhi: What do you all wanna… Okay, so this is the part where I should explain how this is basically gonna work. Blades in the Dark is not entirely designed well for solving mysteries. Gathering information is the mechanic by which you would solve a mystery, but when there’s not a score that necessarily needs to follow it, it kind of falls apart a little bit. So, how this is gonna work is that this is going to be… there might be a little bit of a score-type engagement towards the end when you figure out who done it and need to bring that person in, but otherwise it’s gonna be gathering information against a clock and when that clock fills in the people involved in this are gonna get suspicious and they’re going to go after Bazso again.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: Basically, if you roll low on the Gather Info that will add ticks to the clock, so we’re not necessarily gonna be setting position and effect, you’ll be making Gather Info rolls, you know, there’s consequences attached to it. There may also, depending on what the roll is and what you’re doing, I may go with that there is a personal consequence rather than ticking up the clock, we’ll kind of see how it goes. This is all… I’m winging it. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I have not ever used this kind of twisting of the mechanics before, so we’re just gonna see how it goes. I’m gonna type in this clock here…
Josie: [chuckling] The Bazso Murder Countdown.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: At least it’s a 10 clock.
Rhi: I think that you can also potentially do things, like, if the clock starts getting up pretty high we can talk about if you wanna do things to sort of try and bring that down.
Josie: Do we have a clock for us, or is it more fluid on our end?
Rhi: It’ll be more fluid on your end to kind of put the clues together and figure out who is responsible.
Josie: Despite my love of mysteries I’m actually really terrible at deduction, so we’ll see how this goes. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Similarly, I also like mysteries, but putting them together, especially for RPGs, is really tough.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: So I have a person in mind, and I do have a failsafe for somebody who can just give you the correct answer if it gets to that point.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: If I’m doing a really bad job of giving you clues or you all are just really stumped, I’ve got a thing that can happen. [laughs] So… yeah. I’ve been working on this for like the last week. It’s really hard. So, we’ll see how it goes. With all that said, what do you all wanna do to start investigating this?
Josie: I wish to track down this missing Andre Rowe.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I think finding him will shed some much needed light on this situation.
Minna: I just have this image of us just rolling up to Rado’s club and going in and just pretending to be patrons.
Rhi: [laughs] That is an option.
Josie: Just really quick, I know this conflicts with Blaire’s trauma…
Kim: However?
Josie: …but we need to say it this episode. [cheerfully] Let’s split up, gang. We’ll find more clues that way.
Kim: [shrieks]
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: [smiling] Oh my god.
Kim: Like zoinks, Hex.
[laughter]
Rhi: Minx is gonna go investigate the missing person of Andre Rowe. Do the two of you want to go with her or, as was suggested, do you wanna split up to find more clues?
Kim: I mean, splitting up during Gather Info is fiiine.
Minna: Yeah. I am going to roll up and pretend to be a patron of Rado’s club. [chuckles]
Kim: Right.
Rhi: And if you don’t roll well, actually become a patron.
Minna: And potentially get poisoned. Who knows.
Rhi: Yay~
Kim: Fun time.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: So, I think Blaire, it actually could make sense for you to investigate Constance, because she’s dead, she could have left a ghost. Depends on…
Kim: [gasps] That is true.
Rhi: Criminals are not always the best at proper body disposal.
Kim: Yes, this is true.
Rhi: Okay, so let’s… Yeah, let’s start with Minx.
Josie: I think my angle is I just want to find the people he works with and make, like… I think my angle is, first of all, I’m Shirley Hawkwood, private detective.
Rhi: Mm-hmm?
Josie: I think a, ahem, “companion” of Andre is worried about his whereabouts and has hired me to figure it out.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: She came into my office one night, legs for days, far too many legs… more leg than any woman should have.
[laughter]
Kim: She was a spider.
[laughter]
Rhi: My God.
Josie: Kind of mixing genres here, but…
Rhi: No, no, I’m into it.
Minna: I just really wanna see Minx in a noir episode now.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, go ahead and roll me something for chatting with some of Andre’s associates.
Josie: I feel like Sway is appropriate here, because I’m using a disguise.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. You are.
Josie: Well, I got a 6.
Rhi: Yes. Okay, so you get a good amount of information. Yeah, you talk to some of the people who used to work in Andre’s gang, and I think in particular you talk to a woman named Katya who says that they pretty much all assume that Bazso had him killed.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: They also assume that Bazso had Constance killed. They just are, you know, that’s kind of how you do business, but they don’t have any proof. The thing that’s weird is that normally there would be a body. Bazso isn’t the type to just disappear someone.
Josie: Mm-hmm. He’d want to make an example?
Rhi: He’d wanna make sure that people knew that they were dead. Like, Constance, they assume that he arranged for her to be killed, but everybody knew she was dead. Somebody just going missing doesn’t match his style necessarily, so that’s a weird thing. The other thing that Katya can tell you is that a number of Andre’s former lackeys, gang members, have ended up working as enforcers at a couple of the drug dens, one of which is owned by Viktorov, Rado Viktorov.
Josie: Interesting. Minx puffs thoughtfully on her pipe.
Rhi: I think the last thing that you get from Katya is that she says that Andre was unhappy with the direction things were going, but she believes that ultimately he was loyal to Bazso.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But she does not know what has become of him.
Josie (as Minx): I see, then the motive is called into question. Thank you for your time.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Katya): You’re welcome?
Rhi: She’s very confused.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Let’s go to Blaire.
Kim: Hello.
Rhi: Hi.
Kim: Um…
Rhi: You’re looking for a ghost.
Kim: I am. I am going to roll Attune.
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: Hmm, 2, 4, 6.
Rhi: Okay. I think that initially you have to ask around to try and find where Constance was killed.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Basically, I think there was a big shoot-out on a bridge and she got shot and fell into the water.
Kim: Ohh.
Rhi: So, how do you go about luring in a specific spirit?
Kim: Interesting, because I imagine I don’t think I have any of her personal belongings. There’s no way I would have that.
Rhi: No.
Kim: Do you think I find her just through word of mouth, asking around some friendly spirits I am already acquainted with in the area? Who are like “yeah, there’s a new face in town.”
Rhi: Yeah, you know what, I think that makes sense. Blaire just sort of asks around through the ghostly network. After a little while, I think you’re hanging out on this bridge and it gets really, really cold around you. If you look into the ghost field you see a woman in probably her late 30s, broad shoulders pulled back, a lot of tattoos, and she is fairly recently dead but is already kind of losing substance. She’s not feral, but she’s on her way.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So… but you got a 6, correct?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. What specifically would you be asking Constance about?
Kim: Probably, you know, what the last moments looked like, the motive. Do you know who was coming after you? Description of…
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: If she caught a description of the person.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. So, it was a shoot-out with another gang.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: The Lampblacks’ side was winning and had taken out most of the people, and then somebody kinda slipped into the back ranks of their opponents and just… usually these sort of things you’re just kind of shooting at anybody you can get, this person clearly was shooting at her.
Kim: Oh, so it was targeted.
Rhi: It was targeted at her. She recognized the shooter as a guy named Henner.
Kim: Henner.
Rhi: Who is in fact one of Bazso’s, not lieutenants, but trusted enforcers, like still a street thug, but somebody that Bazso would call upon for things such as this.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: It seems like Constance was killed by Bazso, indirectly.
Kim: Gotcha.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s pretty much it, but she might have some information about—you can ask some follow-up questions and see if she knows anything about other people who were maybe opposing Bazso.
Kim: Yes. I would like to know about that.
Rhi: What she’s able to tell you is that, you know, the lieutenants of the Lampblacks had been talking this over amongst themselves recently and you get, again, she mentions Andre as one of them who was unhappy with the direction that things were going, Rado Viktorov again, and then two additional names. Selma Anadio, she’s pretty high-up. She kind of oversees all of the drug den operations, and then Evette Baldi, who also runs another drug den, so basically Rado and Evette report up the line to Selma who reports to Bazso.
Kim: Gotcha.
Rhi: So, the two of them were also unhappy with how Bazso has been running things. Selma in particular, she had been unhappy for a while, and then her twin brother got killed in the Docks.
Minna: [gasps] No…
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: And she’s been a lot more unhappy. It went from Bazso, this is stupid, to…
Kim: This is personal.
Rhi: …you fucking asshole. Yeah.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: All of these people all thought that this was bad for business. Like, holding the Docks is draining money and people and they’re not getting much back. That is what you are able to find out from this ghost. I think it takes you a while to pull this information out, because she, you know, you have to ask a lot of very precise questions and also probably a few times fend her off, because she’s just kind of like, I’m hungry, and will move to take your body, and you’ll be like nope, have some more ectoplasm.
Kim: Yep. Yeah. Can I send her over to The Reconciled, or do you think she’s too…?
Rhi: There’s not enough there at this point.
Kim: Yeah. Okay. Bummer.
Rhi: Yeah. You can try, you could jar her and try to take her out to The Deathlands later, but…
Kim: [thoughtful sigh] No.
Rhi: All right, so Myra.
Minna: Hello.
Rhi: You are going to a real sketchy drug den.
Minna: I am.
Rhi: So, you walk in and this is like… The place that you used to go, The Devil’s Tooth, that was a classier joint. They had private rooms. There was…
Minna: It was a classy, trustworthy, not sketchy… not super sketchy joint.
Rhi: Yeah. This is not that. [chuckles] There’s a handful of rooms, but it’s just basically like, there’s just, you know, a group of people in each room on various things, probably a lot less quality control in terms of what you’re getting. What’s your stress at right now?
Minna: Two.
Rhi: Two? Okay.
Minna: So I’m doing good.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re not feeling too stressed at this point. I think as you’re moving through the space, since it’s a tar-like thing you can kind of smell it being cooked as people are prepping it.
Minna: Some kind of sickly sweet smell or something, I don’t know.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s kinda niggling at the back of your brain, but you’re not quite there yet.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: What info are you looking for here? Who do you wanna talk to? What do you wanna figure out?
Minna: I… Yeah. I’m going to go talk to Rado.
Rhi: Okay. What do you wanna get out of him?
Minna: I think she approaches him—
Minna (as Myra): Hello. You’re Rado, aren’t you?
Rhi (as Rado): Yeah. Who are you?
Minna (as Myra): My name is Myra Keel. I am looking for a haven, shall we say.
Rhi (as Rado): Okay.
Rhi: Kind of waves a hand at the space.
Rhi (as Rado): Find a cot.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure you understand that as the leader of The magpies…
Minna: Out of character, she’s not the leader, she’s just playing it up.
Rhi: Yeah. [chuckles]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: [laughs] She’s doing this for effect. Don’t kill me.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure you understand that as the leader of The Magpies I have to be selective.
Rhi (as Rado): Then why did you come here?
Minna (as Myra): Because I think you and I have an enemy in common, and you know, the enemy of my enemy…
Rhi: Roll something.
Minna: [giggles] Oh God.
Rhi: [laughing] We have now reached the point where you have piqued his interest.
Minna: Yes. Yes. I think it’s a Sway, because I’m lying through my teeth.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Five!
Rhi: Okay. He eyeballs you, and he had been acting really, like, not making eye contact, just staring into the middle distance, not super engaged, but when you say that his gaze and focus suddenly sharpen and he looks at you.
Rhi (as Rado): The Magpies, you said?
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Rado): You all kinda fucked us a while back, you know?
Minna (as Myra): From what I hear “us” is a very splintered concept these days. We fucked Bazso.
Rhi: He stands up from the table he’s sitting at and just sort of gestures for you to follow, and he will walk you back into his office which is a very small, cramped space. He sits you down, closes the door, sits down behind his desk, and then leans over and opens a drawer.
Rhi (as Rado): You want a drink?
Minna (as Myra): Sure.
Rhi (as Rado): Too bad.
Rhi: He comes up and has a gun on you.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: Oh! … Okay.
Rhi (as Rado): A precaution, you understand.
Minna: Yeah, I think she’s still playing the badass and she is not going to flinch.
Rhi: [chuckles]
Rhi (as Rado): So, who tipped you off?
Minna (as Myra): I have friends in many places. I’m sure you understand I don’t really want to reveal my sources, and they’re not particularly close to the person who originally learned it.
Rhi: He kind of eyes you again.
Rhi (as Rado): So what do you actually want?
Minna (as Myra): What I actually want is to get in on this plan that you have going, whatever it is.
Rhi (as Rado): Well, you understand that I can’t just give you everything, because I have no idea who you are. For all I know Bazso fucking sent you.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, I fully understand that you wouldn’t trust me immediately.
Minna: What is a token of good faith that I can give him?
Kim: A handkerchief.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah, I’m also trying to think of what is something he would ask you to do to prove that you are…
Minna: Yeah, because I don’t think we wanna do a score for him to prove ourselves to him, because why would we do that.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, that’s a lot.
Minna: Ooh, I wonder if there’s something I could have acquired for him that I have a reasonable suspicion he would want, that would help him? But I don’t know what that would be.
Rhi: Maybe…
Minna: So, okay, the information we have on him is that there have been poisonings?
Rhi: Yeah. Well, so, the guards who were on Bazso the night of the attempted assassination had visited Rado’s club before…
Minna: Ah.
Rhi: …and then died a couple hours later of a poisoning, so Bazso thinks that whatever they were given, whatever drugs they did while they were here, were laced with something that killed them.
Minna: How does he know they were here? Is it just word of mouth? Probably, yeah.
Rhi: And this is also the drug den closest to his apartment, so his guards would often come from here or go to here after their shift at his place. I was thinking maybe he’d ask you to acquire some of the poison, but that still is giving away that he actually, you know, is involved in that.
Minna: Oh. I have a connection to… I have connections to several people who make weird and subtle things. Perhaps I could suggest that I have a connection that could get him something subtler and slower-acting.
Rhi: Sure. Yeah. Let’s go with that.
Minna (as Myra): You were a little sloppy the other night with your attempt. The timing on that could have been better. I’ve got a few connections in strange places who might be able to get you something slower-acting than that, something that looks less like poison as well.
Rhi (as Rado): Bring me whatever you can get your hands on and we’ll talk. If it’s any good, maybe I can introduce you to some people.
Minna: Out of character, how are we gonna test this?
Rhi: I’ll just have you do an Acquire Asset roll.
Minna: No, I just—out of character, is somebody going to die who shouldn’t die? [giggles]
Kim: [noise that sounds like “I dunno”]
Minna: I’ll just have to get something and an antidote.
Rhi: [laughs] There you go.
Josie: [chuckles]
Rhi: Yeah. Myra, you’re leaving again, and… yeah, I think on the way out is where it hits you, because you were able to focus a little more on the way in because you knew you needed to talk to somebody, but on your way out, you didn’t push yourself mechanically but you pushed yourself sort of internally to have to get through that conversation.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It would be nice to just…
Minna: [tightly] Mm-hmm.
Rhi: …take a break for a little bit, wouldn’t it? So I think Myra is gonna need to make a resistance check.
Minna: What’s the resistance on that?
Rhi: For this it’s gonna be Resolve.
Minna: All right. I think we’re gonna do that, because she doesn’t trust this guy to give her—she has stuff at home.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: That is a 6.
Rhi: Every god damn time. Okay, yeah. You manage to shrug it off and keep walking, however I am ticking up the clock on because you got a 5.
Minna: Yay.
Rhi: So, yeah, they are… there’s a little suspicion.
Minna: I’m sorry that this was a half-baked plan that we had to think how to make work. [laughs]
Rhi: It’s okay. we are all muddling through this. Like I said, this is an experimental thing. I’m guessing that the three of you will reconvene after your first day of murder mystery investigation.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. You’ve got a variety of leads, you’ve got a couple new names, and you also have a not admission of guilt but a not denial of guilt from Rado Viktorov who seems to be amenable to Myra’s offer of additional poison. How do you all want to proceed?
Josie: Well, first we must address the issue, while it may very well seem like he’s the culprit, given that this seems to be a widespread descent sort of thing, who’s to say that it wasn’t all of them? Or some of them?
Minna: Hmm.
Josie: Or that he’s merely planning his own attempt in addition to someone else trying and failing?
Kim: I mean, that’s true, but he’s also the only lead we have right now.
Josie: I suppose so.
Minna (as Myra): I am certainly intrigued by Rado, it seems that something may be going on with him, but I am also very curious about Selma. If they’re all unhappy she would be a good candidate to climb up in Bazso’s place especially if she has two lieutenants already at her side.
Josie (as Minx): That is true. Do we want to pursue her?
Minna (as Myra): I think it’s worth a look, but we do have an in with Rado, so maybe we begin with him, but I would like to keep her in mind.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Kim (as Blaire): That sounds like a plan.
Josie (as Minx): What has Rado asked of us?
Minna (as Myra): He wants a slow-acting poison. I suggested that I could find one for him.
Josie (as Minx): Aye…
Josie: Do we really have anyone who can get us that?
Rhi: Seeks might be able to whip up something. [laughs]
Josie: You’re right. [laughs]
Minna: Yeah, I was gonna say, we have Seeks. Also, we have Bryl, a drug dealer who may have some connections. We have a couple of connections we can talk to to see if they could find us something like that.
Josie: Since this is a mystery and we’ve made the Sherlock Holmes reference, can we get a hand on, a hold on that drug that makes you seem legally dead for a time?
Rhi: See, that is actually, I was thinking something along those lines…
Minna: Yes~
Rhi: …where Seeks would be able to give you something that would knock somebody out without killing them.
Minna: So we’ll get something that leaves people, yeah, that knocks people out or leaves them bedridden but will clear up.
Rhi: We’ll just say that you’re acquiring an asset from Seeks.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I feel like something like this, quality level is gonna be 4. Somebody can roll me 3d6…
Minna: I can do that.
Rhi: …for your crew’s tier, and we’ll see what you get and then how much money you might need to spend.
Minna: Really? It’s a 3.
Rhi: Oh no. Okay. That’s gonna give you a result of 2.
Minna: How do we—Can we push quality level up?
Rhi: If you spend 2 coin that’ll get you up to what you need.
Minna: I only have 1 coin on my person.
Kim: Believe it or not, I have coin on my person. I have 3 coin.
Rhi: Oh my gosh.
Josie: Whoa.
Kim: I know! Blaire has money!
[chuckling]
Minna: I will use 1 and take 1 from someone else if that’s fine.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. I think that what it is, you kinda describe what you need to Seeks and Seeks is like:
Rhi (as Seeks): Okay. Well, I am going to need, uh…
Rhi: Rattles off a long list of very expensive components and then you all have to go on a mini shopping montage to get all this stuff.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: I think it’s something that’s gonna take a week to actually go into effect, so anywhere from like four days to a week, but as long as they watch during that window for the guards to go out and then it won’t look like “oh, they just came from X drug den.”
Rhi: Ohh! Okay, so really, really slow-acting.
Minna: Or, it doesn’t have to be four days to a week, but like… a couple of days rather than like, oh, later that evening they passed out after visiting the drug den, because you know, when someone gets food poisoning you don’t usually look to the place they went three days before they got the food poisoning.
Rhi: That’s true. Does Myra wanna deliver this alone or do you wanna bring the other two?
Minna: What do you guys think?
Kim: I’ll tag along.
Minna: Okay. She’s going to brief you that she pretended to be the leader of the gang and also is adopting a slightly different persona.
Josie: I don’t think I’m going to show up.
Minna: Okay. I’m there with a lieutenant. [giggles]
Rhi: [laughs] Oh no. Okay. Minx, Josie… I almost asked Minx is Josie doing anything, which…
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: I mean, I’m just sitting here, so…
Rhi: Yeah. Josie, do you wanna have Minx do anything while these two are going and talking to Rado? You could follow up on one of these other names. I know Myra said she was interested in learning more about Selma potentially.
Josie: Yeah. I wanna figure out some more info about her. I think my disguise angle on this one is that I’m looking to open a place but I don’t wanna do that without the permission of a kingpin. Right? [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: Because I don’t want to get my kneecaps confiscated.
Rhi: Yep. Okay. Let’s start then with Myra and Blaire. It probably takes Seeks a few days to whip something up, but she will present it to you very proudly and will describe how it works. So yeah, you show up back at the drug den, and yeah, Rado will escort you back into his office and kinda looks sideways at Blaire when she follows Myra in.
Minna (as Myra): My friend, Blaire.
Kim: Uh, fake names?
Rhi: Nope. Myra went in here being like “I am Myra Keel of The magpies.”
Minna: Oh! If you want a persona, though, you can have a persona, if we discussed ahead of time.
Kim: No. Fuck it. I’m Blaire.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: It’s fine.
Rhi (as Rado): All right… You bring me anything interesting?
Minna: She wordlessly slides a vial across the desk.
Rhi (as Rado): And what does it do?
Minna (as Myra): Within 48 hours of being administered the target should pass out. I’m sure you can keep an eye on the guards during that period, and it won’t be directly after coming from your establishment.
Rhi (as Rado): That could have a lot of applications.
Rhi: I think I’m gonna need another roll from you to persuade him to admit to anything.
Minna: Can it—Hmm. It might be Sway again.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Would you like an assist?
Minna: I mean, sure. I did get a 6 on that.
Rhi: Okay. He kinda eyes you.
Rhi (as Rado): Well, I’ll have to take this up the chain to see if she approves of the plan, and if so…
Rhi: He pauses for a second.
Rhi (as Rado): …what do you want out of this?
Minna (as Myra): Bazso has not exactly held up his end of the bargain. While he has attempted to maintain control of the Docks we had planned to have more involvement. Frankly, we want the Docks for ourselves.
Rhi (as Rado): Huh. I’ll take that higher up the chain, too. Come back in a couple days and I’ll let you know how things sound.
Rhi: So, he will shoo you out, but what he did let slip inadvertently is—
Minna: Yep, she, higher up the chain!
Josie: Uh-huh!
Rhi: [laughing] So let’s cut over to Minx.
Josie: Yeah. I don’t wanna directly meet her yet. I want to figure out as much about her as possible.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Trying to start a small personal operation.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: She’s kind of the… She’s the drug kingpin of the area, and can’t really do that without permission or knowing how to approach her, so…
Rhi: Right. Right. What’s my initial offering in terms of a bribe that I need to make?
Josie: Right. [laughs]
Rhi: What’s the weekly cut that I need to be setting aside? That sort of thing?
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Got it. Okay. You’re kinda asking around some of the other drug purveyors?
Josie: Exactly.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Go ahead and make me a roll.
Josie: Six.
Rhi: Okay. On a 6, a lot of what you get is pretty consistent in terms of what Selma expects from people in terms of getting a cut, how much money is due upfront. There are certain drugs that they wanna maintain a monopoly over that you’re not allowed to offer. If you start asking more about what is she like to work with as a person, because I assume that’s sort of where you steer around to…
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: …you know, for a high-ranked lieutenant of a criminal organization who makes its money through beating people to bloody pulps and cheap drugs, she’s a pretty fair person. If you stay in your lane and do what’s expected and pay on time you’ll basically be left alone, and if you kind of develop a good record of, you know, if you pay consistently for a year and then you have a bad month, you know, you’ll be given a few days or even a week to get the money together before they come after your kneecaps.
Josie: Yay! [laughs]
Rhi: Although, I think what you do get is that some people report that’s how things operate, you do talk to a couple people who say that lately she seems to have been less flexible and less patient, has been a lot more demanding that people pay up immediately, has even been turning up a little bit of pressure in terms of asking for more money than normal, that sort of thing.
Josie: Okay, so it’s definitely affecting her work right now.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Something is.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Okay… Where can I meet with her?
Rhi: I think that for meetings, if she’s meeting with either other gangs or independent contractors as it were, independent operators, she has a place that she meets with folks in Tangletown.
Josie: Oh yay.
Minna: [gasps] Yay.
Rhi: Yeah, which is an old leviathan hunter that sank in the river near Crow’s Foot and basically a bunch of people started building on it and lashed old ships to it and expanded it out, and it’s now just sort of a little floating shanty town neighborhood. Everyone in Crow’s Foot, even a lot of the gangs throughout the city, respect Tangletown as absolute neutral ground. Gang warfare is not permitted there, and it’s a self-policing system. Even so much as a bar brawl between a couple opposing gangs, not even a serious fight, will see all involved grabbed by other criminals and chucked into the river.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Maybe they’ll swim to shore, maybe they won’t, but it’s just like you don’t start shit in Tangletown, because it is important to have neutral ground for these sort of things. I think there’s a little dive bar where she will conduct meetings with people.
Josie: Okay. That’s good to know. That kind of rules out taking her during a meeting. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, that was part of where I was like, oh, this will also add a bit of a wrench to… [laughs]
Josie: Yeah. Now we know where she’d be heading to if I scheduled a meeting.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: I’d like to reconvene before I decide on other stuff.
Rhi: Okay. So, the name of—I went to a tavern name generator, and the name of the dive bar where she wants to meet with you is called The Cheap Club.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: You know what you’re getting. But yes, yeah, you can all reconvene and figure out what you’re doing next.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. We do still need proof, ultimately. I mean, we’re not trying to get this passed in a court of law, but we want to assure Bazso that he is safe. Rado admitted to it, basically.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): But will that word be enough?
Minna (as Myra): Well, Rado admitted that he was a lackey to somebody. I think it would be good to confirm who’s in charge of the operation. We can make a guess, but we can’t be certain.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx, I will tell you that I think you know Bazso well enough to know that he will take verbal confirmation.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. He doesn’t need a written out plan in somebody’s handwriting if you come in and be like yeah it’s these two fuckers.
Josie: Yeah. To be honest, he’ll probably take who we give to him…
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: …but if we’re wrong that could be bad.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Minna: We want to get the right person too, because we don’t want him to die, necessarily.
Josie: Yeah, and the person above—What’s her name, Selma?—is just Bazso again, right?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. She answers directly to him. Yeah.
Josie: Yeah. But you said Bazso still needs to go up the chain to the Crows.
Rhi: Yeah. The Crows run Crow’s Foot.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Bazso wants to take them down someday, but he is not in a position to do so at this point. Basically, he does not work for the Crows; in order for him to operate in Crow’s Foot he has to basically pay a percentage to the Crows.
Josie: Right. Are there any opposing forces on the Docks?
Rhi: Yes. In addition to the Umbra Hunters, who are somewhat weakened, on the Docks you’ve got, where are they… the Billhooks and the Grinders.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Both of whom are also bravos, street toughs.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: In addition to the conflict between the Umbra Hunters and the Lampblacks that you all kind of generated, you also introduced a third very violence-inclined faction into the Docks.
Josie: That’s the problem. we can’t rule out that someone in another group isn’t pulling the strings. It may very well be agents that are working in the Lampblacks, but as far as up the chain goes…
Rhi: Yeah, it could be. The leader of the Crows is a woman too, so who knows. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah, so… [laughs] Well, the Crows are top dog, so unless they have gotten worried about the Lampblacks they probably wouldn’t do this.
Rhi: Yeah. I will say, because you all are criminals, you’re just sort of tapped into the local gossip, yeah, the problem that the Crows had with the Lampblacks previously was because the Lampblacks were at war with the Red Sashes.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: The Lampblacks won that war, the Red Sashes have been wiped out, and now the Crows are fine with whatever the Lampblacks are doing so long as they’re getting paid.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So long as they pay their money and they know their place, everything’s fine, and right now Bazso is not making any plays.
Josie: here’s also the thing. It could also very well be the Circle slash Umbra Hunters. They have shown that they can figure out people who are close to us through Salia. Like, it’s possible that this is an outside scheme to take Bazso out, potentially to get to me, but then again they’d also know we’re not on great terms… me and Bazso.
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, there are a lot of possibilities. This is true.
Josie: I think it’s probably either that or it is Selma.
Rhi: Well, I think either way you probably need to go meet with her.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Do all three of you want to go?
Josie: Yeah, we might as well.
Kim: Sure.
Rhi: All right. So, I think there’s messages sent off and you arrange this meeting, and yeah, you make your way down into Crow’s Foot across the… bridge is a little too generous a description.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Rafts and boards kinda lashed together that lead out to Tangletown. It’s not a very… I think there’s ropes that are tied across as handholds slash things to grab onto if a board drops out from under you. it’s not easygoing. Your boots, all of you, end up soaked, because all of these things kind of sink down into the water a little bit, there’s waves lapping up.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But you make it over to Tangletown and over to The Cheap Club [laughs] where you find Selma waiting for you. She is Akorosi, short dark hair, light skin. I think she’s got a burn scar on the right side of her forehead, kinda going up into her hairline, wearing a hat, sitting there drinking the one thing that’s on the menu. You just, you go and you ask for a drink and you are given… something
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: that bears a resemblance to a beer.
Josie: Honestly, I think our angle here, we might just be we come as ourselves and like… We know no violence can happen here, and I can tell if she’s lying, so we just gotta try and provoke something.
Kim: That makes sense.
Rhi: Do we wanna call this the start of a score?
Kim: It kinda feels like it, doesn’t it?
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah. I feel like this is a Social score.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Because I feel like if nothing else the guy who more or less admitted to being involved in this indicated that she was the one that he was taking his orders from, so if nothing else you need to grab her to find out does it stop at her or does it continue on higher up.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Just gonna say this is a 2d6 engagement roll… and I got a 6. You’re starting off in a controlled position as you’re walking into this technically a bar. Selma is sitting at a table, has a mug in her hand already, and kinda nods at you all when you come in.
Rhi (as Selma): Heard a lot about you, the famed Magpies.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I’m glad the papers are getting around.
Rhi (as Selma): Have a seat.
Josie: Minx will gingerly sit.
Rhi: The crate creaks ominously under you. chuckles]
Josie: Mm-hmm. [laughs]
Minna: Myra sits with absolute confidence that nothing will give under her.
Rhi: It also creaks, but yeah, you’re fine.
Kim: Am I the trifecta? I’m the one who’s seat just breaks underneath me?
Rhi: [rolls] … Nope, you’re fine.
Kim: Comedy comes in threes, Rhi!
[laughter]
Rhi: It hasn’t broken “yet.” One of you still could.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Minna: Rhi periodically makes a roll.
Rhi: Once you’re all seated Selma will kind of eye you.
Rhi (as Selma): So, I’m gonna go out on a limb here and guess that you are not actually interested in opening up another drug den in my neighborhood, right?
Josie (as Minx): No, we aren’t. We’ve been having to tell many stories in order to work up to getting a meeting with you.
Rhi (as Selma): Yeah, I heard a couple of them.
Rhi: Kind of glances at Myra.
Minna (as Myra): Wouldn’t you love to know which ones are true?
Rhi: She just smirks and takes a sip.
Rhi (as Selma): So, what are you actually after here?
Josie (as Minx): We want to know whether you have attempted on Bazso Baz’s life. If you have, well, we might be able to assist.
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Josie: Yeah. I think this is—
Minna: Sway. You’re lying.
Josie: Yeah, I guess I’m lying.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Like, the thing is I’m just trying to go for candor to get her to say something that I can use Like Looking In A Mirror on.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: I’ve got a feeling this isn’t the place where candor will… well, no, candor probably would work.
Minna: You’re being blunt but you’re not being truthful.
Josie: Critical.
Rhi: Oof.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Jesus Christ.
Josie: Like, I think part of it is just like, okay, we’ve been lying all day, we’ve been dancing the games, we’re here on neutral ground, let’s get to the point. Right?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. I’m just trying to think of how she’s gonna react to this… Okay, I know what it is. I think she kinda eyes you, Minx, and smirks.
Rhi (as Selma): Well it took you long enough.
Minna: [delighted hum]
Rhi (as Selma): From what I heard, the way Bazso talks about it anyway, you and him have been heading for this sort of thing for years.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, I think we have been trying to give each other a bit of a three strikes rule… or five, or seven.
Rhi (as Selma): Hmph. Apparently he ran out on your side, huh?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Once… He changed, and not for the better.
Rhi (as Selma): Oh, don’t we all? Hmm. This could actually work to my advantage. I have a feeling that he suspects anybody who’s ever said an ill word about his leadership or decision-making abilities, so…
Josie (as Minx): No doubt.
Rhi (as Selma): I know that you all aren’t on the best of terms with him, but he might not see you coming, so if you all wanna do the honors…
Josie (as Minx): I know that he does not think we can do it, but if we’re doing it for you, well, might as well get paid for our time, yes?
Rhi (as Selma): Sure.
Minna (as Myra): We’re speaking with the ringleader, yes? I’m not sure I’m comfortable making this deal with a lackey.
Rhi (as Selma): Yeah, I’m the one in charge.
Minna: Is she lying? I think Myra glances sideways at Minx.
Rhi: Let me look up the text of that. A lie of omission is a lie. So, Minx, whatever kind of… You can tell that she is leaving something out. She’s not entirely lying, she is in charge of this operation, but there’s something missing.
Josie: Yes. Hmm. Now I’m trying to think about my approach here.
Kim: Yeah, do we wanna press harder, or…?
Josie: I think Minx will just say out loud:
Josie (as Minx): Well that was awfully quick.
Rhi (as Selma): Fucker got my brother killed, and I was willing to be patient and talk to him and hope that he’d get his head out of his ass eventually, and then I ran out of patience.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Selma): And there’s a lot of us who aren’t happy, so I talked to some of them and we came to an arrangement. He’s gone, I take over, we pull out of the Docks, we start running this gang sensibly again, stop getting people killed.
Josie (as Minx): That… Sorry for your loss.
Rhi: She kinda nods and takes another swig.
Josie: So, real quick out of character thing right here. [laughs]
Rhi: Uh-huh?
Josie: I wasn’t expecting to have sympathy for it.
Rhi: [in a sinister voice] Welcome to hell!
Josie: I know!
Rhi: [hissing] I did it on purpose!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. How do you wanna proceed?
Josie: I think Minx just wants to push ahead and get some numbers on the table, and you know, just proceed normally, and then as soon as they’re out of Tangletown be like:
Josie (as Minx): What the fuck?!
Rhi: So basically try to get her to agree to like, okay, I’ll pay you X amount to kill Bazso, right?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. We can just sort of gloss over that negotiation. I think that between all of you and Selma you’re able to come to, I mean, it doesn’t really matter what you all agree to because you’re not gonna get that money, most likely.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Unless you all take a hard left here that I am not foreseeing.
Minna: [giggles]
Josie: [laughs] Uh-huh.
Rhi: Yeah. You agree to something that’s reasonable, a reasonable amount of money for an assassination, it’s fine.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: And then she says, when it’s done, she’ll contact you and you’ll meet back here is the plan.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: And when you all get up to go she does not move.
Josie: Yep, makes sense.
Rhi: She is staying put.
Josie: Yeah. Minx wants to get out of there and meet with Bazso as soon as she can.
Rhi: I mean, if the three of you want to go straight from there over to…
Minna: Sure.
Rhi: …the Lampblacks headquarters.
Kim: Well, I just wanna make sure we’re all on the same page here. We’re definitely killing Bazso?
Josie: Oh, no, I just wanted to figure out what the fuck happened.
Kim: Yeah~
Rhi: Heh…
Josie: [chuckles]
Rhi: So just talk to Bazso and try and get his side of things?
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, and I think it’s like, okay, we know, but you need to explain everything before we tell you.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Cards on the table time.
Rhi: Yeah. So, do you go to Lampblacks headquarters or do you send him a message and try to arrange a meeting elsewhere?
Josie: I think… Minx is reckless, so she’s gonna push for Lampblacks headquarters.
Kim: [nervous groan]
Rhi: Just march straight up there?
Minna: I’m going to push for an empty house that is neutral territory.
Kim: Yeah. I don’t like the idea of meeting him on his home turf.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: If Minx is outnumbered she can be restrained.
Rhi: [laughing] Yeah, I’m just—Minx striding forward and Blaire and Myra grab her arms. “No~”
Josie (as Minx): But, but… [sighs] Fine.
Rhi: Yeah. I think you send him a note and find an abandoned building not too far from headquarters so it’s not like you have to wait a really long time.
Minna: yeah.
Rhi: And yeah, he shows up after a little bit, walks in. As he walks in the door he’s pulling a gun out from under his jacket, not aiming it at any of you specifically, it just…
Minna: Paranoid.
Rhi: He’s very paranoid right now, yeah, and he just has agreed to—even though it’s people that he knows, he still has just been invited to a meeting in an abandoned building.
Josie: [chuckles]
Rhi: So he walks in and looks a little surprised to see Minx and Blaire there.
Rhi (as Bazso): Oh, so you brought the whole family along.
Josie (as Minx): Quite. We have a name.
Rhi (as Bazso): Wonderful.
Josie (as Minx): What haven’t you told us?
Rhi (as Bazso): What are you talking about?
Josie (as Minx): What is going on with you, Bazso?
Kim (as Blaire): You killed Selma’s brother?
Rhi (as Bazso): I didn’t kill her brother. He was up in the Docks. The Docks have been bad. A lot of people have died up there.
Josie (as Minx): She is the ringleader.
Rhi (as Bazso): Huh.
Josie (as Minx): It seems very much like someone will simply step into her spot.
Rhi (as Bazso): Ringleader. Who else? Who else is involved?
Josie (as Minx): Rado.
Rhi (as Bazso): Oh. Eh, kinda figured. All right. Anybody else?
Kim (as Blaire): Someone named Andre?
Rhi (as Bazso): He went missing weeks ago. I don’t know what happened to him, but if he turns up again I’ll keep it in mind.
Josie (as Minx): That’s the thing, Bazso. Her sentiment of her thinking you got her brother killed, that was a common element with everyone we investigated, different reasons, of course there are some like Rado seeking to pounce on it, but…
Minna (as Myra): We’re finding people both inside your gang and outside your gang.
Josie (as Minx): Something needs to change, Bazso.
Rhi (as Bazso): And what the fuck do you want me to do?! You’re the ones that said that I could waltz into the Docks and hold it and have all this wonderful territory, and I’ve been getting my ass kicked for months, because of you!
Rhi: It started as a general you. It very quickly narrowed to Minx in terms of who he is addressing.
Josie (as Minx): Believe it or not, I don’t want you dead, Bazso.
Rhi (as Bazso): I know. You just wanna see me off my throne again.
Josie (as Minx): No Bazso, I want you to… I want you to be doing all right for yourself, not… I don’t know.
Rhi (as Bazso): If I pull out of the Docks… I keep my word. We agreed that I’d hold them, I’ve been holding them, and I am not entirely without a heart. I know what’s gonna happen if Mora moves in. it’s bad now. It’ll be worse. It’ll be so much worse. If I pull out of the Docks, a lot of these problems that I’m having will go away, so are you all gonna be able to do something?
Josie (as Minx): I’ll admit, I don’t know what to do either. There’s only so many of us.
Minna (as Myra): Do the people of the Docks know that you’re there partly to protect them from that? Is there a way that you could make allies where you are now?
Rhi (as Bazso): The refugees that moved back in, yeah, but hard to protect people when I’m fighting a war on three fronts, well I guess four fronts now because I got internal strife.
Minna (as Myra): If there’s anything I’ve learned it’s that making more friends has never made the fight harder. Well, occasionally, you know, people are able to threaten you through your friends, but I don’t see that stopping you. if you can get more allies that can only be good. Take some of the burden off yourself. Ask for help.
Rhi: He eyes Myra for a long time and then looks at Minx, and then just kinda tightens his jaw.
Rhi (as Bazso): I’ve found that friends are rarely as reliable as you’d like them to be.
Josie: Minx will just kinda look away in shame a little bit.
Rhi (as Bazso): I don’t have a lot of people that I can turn to right now, and it’s not easy to build new connections when you’ve got this many knives at your throat.
Minna: I’m trying to think if we have any allies that we could connect them with.
Rhi: Yeah. You don’t have allies among a lot of gangs is the thing.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: You have a lot of individuals, but you don’t actually, like, I think the closest that I could think of is the Silver nails, and they’re not so much an… eh, you have a mutually beneficial relationship with them.
Minna: I’m still trying to think if there’s any way we could harness the citizenry of the Docks and have them actually be, you know, working with Bazso and not being terrorized by Bazso while he’s trying to protect them.
Josie (as Minx): Bazso, you have how many underneath you, dozens within the gang and without? There’s the three of us, but think, how have we managed to survive, especially with the Circle after us?
Rhi (as Bazso): It’s real fucking rich that you of all people are trying to sell me on the power of friendship.
Josie (as Minx): I know.
Minna (as Myra): Whatever happened between you two it was years ago, now.
Rhi (as Bazso): It was actually a couple months ago when you all interrupted my ritual and attacked a bunch of my people. That was much more recent that you all kinda screwed me there.
Minna: [smiling] What were we doing then? Out of character.
Rhi: You were planting a fake Hand of Kotar to instigate the Circle of Flame to start attacking the Lampblacks.
Minna: Ah! That’s right! That’s right. We weren’t friends for a while.
Rhi: The current situation that Bazso is in is about 85% y’all’s fault.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Yeah… Yeah. So, let’s see. What can we do to help?
Kim: We could give him cookies.
[laughter]
Rhi: So, I mean, you could… Basically, he’s staying in the Docks because he knows that if he leaves it’ll be worse for the people there.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Doing something else to continue to prevent Mora from moving in if the Lampblacks pull out, or finding somebody else to ally with him, like convincing another gang to back him up so that he can actually get some breathing room, because he’s never really had a solid hold on the territory. He’s had to fight for every inch of it this whole time, and that’s why it’s been bleeding him dry.
Josie (as Minx): Bazso, what do you know about the Circle?
Rhi (as Bazso): Uh, they really fucking hate you.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, that is true, but them personally.
Rhi (as Bazso): They’re running the gang that has been a pain in my ass, one of the gangs that’s been a pain in my ass lately. That’s about all I know. It’s kind of all I need to know.
Josie (as Minx): Do you know which one of them is pushing that gang at the moment?
Rhi: He shrugs.
Josie (as Minx): Hmm.
Rhi: And then winces.
Minna (as Myra): You still haven’t had that seen to?
Rhi (as Bazso): [angrily] I’m fine.
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): I think maybe we might have the contacts to, if not another gang, at least sway opinion, and then of course I’ve got…
Josie: She sort of just clicks her sword cane.
Josie (as Minx): …for everyone else.
Rhi: For the first time in a while Bazso actually gives you a, it’s a small smile, closer to a smirk, but it is genuine.
Rhi (as Bazso): Heh. Well, you toughened up again, Ellie.
Josie (as Minx): Well, having friends will do that.
Rhi (as Bazso): Right…
Kim: Oof.
Rhi (as Bazso): I am gonna clean house, ask some questions of some people, and uh… in the meantime, if you all can figure out a way to get me some breathing room, do it, but otherwise I can’t hold the territory much longer.
Josie (as Minx): If you end up having to leave, do so. We don’t hold ill will about it.
Rhi: At that, actually, he seems to relax a little bit. I guess apparently keeping his word is very important to him. I hadn’t really thought about that prior to this episode, but I think that’s where I’m landing with him. [laughs]
Josie: Yeah, seems like.
Kim: I mean, that tracks.
Minna: [giggling] I just can’t get over the fact that Myra and Bazso are just like dark mirrors of each other.
Rhi: Yeah, there’s an alternate universe where they’re the best of friends.
Rhi (as Bazso): All right. Well, you all see what you can do, and uh, I’m gonna go torture some people for information about who’s trying to kill me.
Rhi: [laughs] He kinda salutes at you and goes to leave.

"Season 3, Episode 12: The Powered Up Score Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you for joining us.
Things are, to put it mildly, very frightening and stressful right now. There’s a lot of uncertainty about what we’re facing in our hometowns and nations and around the world. I’ll be honest, it feels pretty weird to be doing normal things like putting out a podcast episode right now, but over the last few days as things in the United States and elsewhere seem to have taken a somewhat dire turn what stood out to me the most is how people are reaching out to each other. People are offering support and comfort, making deliberate efforts to forge human connection, now that we have to keep our distance from each other. I have no idea if episodes of this show can do the same, but I hope that, if nothing else, an hour or so of escapism will help a little bit.
Minna is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity, but I also recommend looking for places in your communities where you can donate. Food banks and homeless shelters are going to be in desperate need, and they can stretch cash donations really far, so if not our charity of the month then a charity in your town.
Minna: This month’s Featured Charity is the League of Women Voters. They have a mission to empower voters and defend democracy by working to expand voter access and fight voter suppression. They provide election guides and information for voters and help them register to vote. If you’d like to donate they can be found at lwv.org.
Rhi: Part of why this pandemic looks like it’s going to get pretty bad in the United States is because many of the people in authority are making choices that will actively make this situation worse. If you can vote by mail, please do so. If you can’t, call your local officials and ask that vote by mail be instituted, if not for the primaries then for the general election in November. Be safe, be thoughtful about your choices and how they might impact the most vulnerable around you, and be kind. Call out bigotry and hate and misinformation where you see it, of course, but most of us are just trying to get through these very scary days, so offer kindness to each other where you can.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:52]
Rhi: We open up in Charhollow. It is later in the night. That doesn’t really mean a lot in terms of what it looks like out here. It’s still very dark. The streetlamps are glowing. There’s a fair amount of people on the streets. We kind of move through the streets as people are either heading home or heading to work, making their way over into Coalridge for the mines that never really close. We find our way to Kellen’s, which is one of the oldest pubs in the city, dates back to when the Skovlanders who founded Doskvol had opened this place up, and on the first floor of Kellen’s it is pretty well-packed. It’s a busy night, lots of people here drinking after their shifts. There’s a couple card games going. Servers are carrying around trays of drinks.
We see the familiar face of Klyra, an old friend of Minx’s, at the bar pouring drinks, and she is pouring drinks and filling up glasses onto a tray which she slides over to a server who grunts, hoists it up onto her shoulder, and she makes her way through the bar and up a narrow back set of stairs. Gets up to the top, heads down a narrow hallway, and with her free hand raps on the door and then opens it. As she carries in the tray we see there is a large table in the middle of this room, and seated around this table is a somewhat eclectic group.
There is Bazso Baz, the leader of the Lampblacks. He is dressed in kind of his typical fashion. The Lampblacks align themselves more with the working class, so he’s got kind of the button-up work shirt, suspenders look going.
There’s also Belle Brogan who is sort of the leader of the unionization efforts here in Charhollow and Coalridge. There are a couple people posted up behind her leaning against the wall who are pretty obviously her bodyguards.
There’s also a handful of other citizens here, people that are less familiar. There’s three people that are kinda seated together that are huddled together, talking amongst themselves, looking a little suspicious of all of the rest of you.
There’s another person who is I think actually chatting with Belle, and then the last three people at this table are The magpies. This meeting, odd as it is, is the Magpies’ effort at trying to basically get Bazso those friends that Myra and Minx were so insistent that he needed, trying to get the people of the Docks to be able to defend themselves from the likes of Lord Mora and the other gangs on the Docks.
There is this group of people here. You’ve asked—basically the three people who are huddled together are some, you asked for some representatives from the Docks, and then the person who’s chatting with Belle is from the one-block square that Seeks kind of did a smaller version of what you all are hoping to do here. Seeks basically, the neighborhood around her clinic, her old clinic, they managed to kind of drive out the Bluecoats and the gangs and they just take care of themselves now. Seeks was unable to make it herself, but she sent somebody who is familiar with how things operate in her little neighborhood to kinda start talking about how to try and do that at a larger scale in the Ink Row neighborhood.
So, the drinks are set out, and I think as they’re handed out one of the people in the group from the Docks leans over towards the three of you.
Rhi (as Docks rep): Uh… I don’t really know if there’s an order to this sort of thing, but I wanted to, uh, I guess introduce myself before we got into this. I’m Stev Haig. I’m Phin’s older brother.
Minna: [gasps, squeaks with joy]
Josie: Oh—Sorry, we need to squee for a second. [laughs]
Minna: Sorry. [giggles]
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Oh… It’s good to meet you.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah…
Rhi (as Stev): Yeah. I heard The Magpies were looking for folks, so I figured I oughta show up.
Minna (as Myra): It’s so wonderful to meet you.
Rhi (as Stev): Yeah. It’s good to meet all of you. Phin asks about you in her letters sometimes, so I’m glad I’ll be able to have—
Kim (as Blaire): You’ve heard from her?
Rhi (as Stev): Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. She doesn’t get a chance to write too often. She’s on a leviathan hunter now.
Minna (as Myra): Oh wow.
Josie (as Minx): Oh. Good for her.
Minna (as Myra): I can’t imagine she loves that.
Rhi (as Stev): She’s actually doing… I think it was a little rough for her at first, from what we heard. I mean, you know Phin, you kinda gotta read between the lines.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. [chuckles]
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Stev): But uh, no, she said she’s doing pretty good in the crew. She kinda punched her way into a position of power.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, that’s about right.
Minna (as Myra): That’s Phin.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Stev): The last letter I got it sounded like they were maybe looking at promoting her on the ship, not quite an officer’s position but something a little higher up.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s great.
Rhi (as Stev): Yeah. Yeah. It seems like she’s doing pretty good. You know, I mean, I guess as good as you can be out on one of those ships.
Josie (as Minx): Right.
Rhi (as Stev): Still keeping her distance from here, though. She writes when she can.
Minna (as Myra): What about your family? Is your family doing all right?
Rhi (as Stev): Yeah. Yeah. The Bluecoats have been leaving us alone. Haven’t—I mean, you know, they haven’t been paying us any special attention, just sort of the usual.
Minna (as Myra): That’s good. I know that’s what Phin wanted.
Rhi (as Stev): Yeah, but I, uh… yeah. You all seem to be doing pretty good. I mean…
Rhi: He kinda looks around the room and then gestures.
Josie: [chuckles]
Rhi (as Stev): You’re organizing stuff like this, so… I’ll let her know, next time I get a chance to write to her.
Josie (as Minx): Well, it’s not organized yet.
Rhi (as Stev): Heh.
Minna (as Myra): Wait ‘til we see the results.
Rhi: I think at that point Bazso kind of, ahem, clears his throat.
Rhi (as Bazso): As touching as this all is, I do have some business I need to attend to tonight and I imagine I’m not the only one, so… we should probably get started.
Rhi: So, I don’t know if the three of you have any ideas about how this meeting would run. It’s not exactly that—It’s more that you three kind of brought everyone together. [laughs]
Josie: Minx has no specific ideas, but basically if there’s any sort of… if vanguard patrols need help getting set up she is volunteering for anything, like, way out in front, essentially.
Rhi: Okay. There’s a little bit of uncertainty. People go around and introduce themselves. Some of the other people that you have here, like the other representatives from the Docks are a Fiona Barker, who is a leader of the porters who move stuff around on the docks, and she has also kind of been trying to get a unionization movement going on the Docks. It’s not as successful as what Belle Brogan has been doing down here in the mines, but you know, she’s trying. Then, Emerson Miles who used to work in one of the tattoo shops on Ink Row and really is more in this for like, you know… revenge on the people who have made their life a living hell lately.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Then the last person from Seeks’s neighborhood is named Leo, and they basically will talk about how they do things in that little block. I think Belle Brogan ends up taking control of the meeting. She’s an extremely charismatic person and also has a lot of experience with this sort of thing. What she says is that, you know, I think Minx maybe mentions “oh yeah, I’d be willing to help out with patrols and stuff,” and what she says is that before we get to the point of setting up patrols we need to make sure we have supplies. Weapons is gonna be a big one, making sure that the people who are gonna be doing the policing are armed, but we also are looking at electroplasm for generators and even food. She anticipates that it is possible that there may end up being a siege situation when this starts. Basically, at that point in the conversation, people start looking to the three of you [laughs] as, ah, people who can get things
Josie: Well, also, Minx is kind of dressing down and using Ellie voice
Rhi: Mm.
Minna: Hmm.
Josie: Although it’s a little more deliberate here.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: It’s kind of like if she shows up as her usual posh self it’s not gonna be received well. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): How much ectoplasm do you need?
Rhi (as Belle): I mean… the more the merrier. You know, if we don’t use it we can sell it or stockpile it for the future, but really as much as we could get. Same with food. Same with weapons.
Josie (as Minx): Judging by the looks we’re getting, the ectoplasm is gonna be our job.
Rhi (as Belle): You’re welcome to get whatever you’d like, but if that’s what you all would like to be responsible for, I think we’ve got some connections with some of the folks in Barrowcleft, we can probably get food. The weapons are gonna be trickier.
Rhi: I think at that point Bazso’s like:
Rhi (as Bazso): I can get weapons.
[chuckling]
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, I figured. At least we won’t want for medicine.
Rhi: Yeah. Leo kind of nods.
Rhi (as Leo): Seeks already has started setting some things aside, supplies and the like, and if need be can send a couple physickers up here to help.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent. So, I think we need to get planning on where to get the ectoplasm from.
Rhi: Last time you all were gonna, you did have to steal some electroplasm for Lord Scurlock last season, you took it from the lightning barriers.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Probably gonna be tough to pull something like that off again.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, if that’s the thing you all wanna focus on…?
Josie: Yeah, I think so.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah.
Josie: It’s gonna be the most dangerous and hardest to get, so I figure the gang that does… the crew that does that should do that. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, that makes sense.
Minna: We did start out life as thieves.
Rhi: Yeah, I think the meeting will break up, and as the three of you are heading out Bazso calls after you and will catch up with you just outside of Kellen’s.
Josie (as Minx): Oh?
Josie: Minx is already doing her hair up again now that she’s out of there.
Rhi: I think he just kind of notes that and rolls his eyes really theatrically, and then addressing the group is like:
Rhi (as Bazso): Uh… I don’t know if this is helpful to you, but since you, uh… I know you’re dealing with some kind of bullshit with the Circle of Flame, I had some conversation with the traitors in my midst before their untimely demises, and they had made contact with the Umbra Hunters who put them in touch with that Lord Mora fucker, and basically he cut a deal with them that if they killed me and then pulled the gang out of the Docks he was gonna get them some extra funding.
Minna (as Myra): Playing dirty, I see.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah. Now, I couldn’t tell, people were not consistent in their answers as to if they reached out to the Umbra Hunters or the Umbra Hunters reached out to them, I’m not sure what direction that came from I don’t know if it matters, but I figured it might be good to know that he’s getting a little more underhanded I guess.
Josie (as Minx): That is good to know, Bazso. Thank you.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah…
Josie (as Minx): Although fortunately the Circle and the Hunters may be on the outs.
Rhi (as Bazso): Here’s hoping. You seem to be lacking for ambition these days.
Josie (as Minx): Heh. I don’t know if we’re lacking ambition, just personal ambition. This is way harder than getting rich quick, Bazso. [laughs]
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah… Yeah, it is. I guess we’ll see if it’s worth it.
Rhi: He tips his cap and strolls off into the night.
Josie: Minx will give a little salute.
[chuckling]
Rhi: All right. The task laid before you then is to steal and transport a large amount of electroplasm from somewhere in the city up to the old Ink Row district in the Docks. I think Fiona Barker, that porter and new unionizer, is at the moment acting as the leadership in the Docks, so she has the basement of a warehouse that she cleared out where as all these supplies are gathered people can stash stuff there. That’s your end goal, to put a whole bunch of electroplasm in that basement.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: You just have to get it from somewhere and get it to that basement without blowing the location of where things are being stashed.
Josie: We need to steal electroplasm and transport it, so I say we steal an electroplasm transport.
Kim: Huh… That could work.
[laughter]
Minna: Yeah…
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, yeah. [laughs] It’s simple. It’s elegant.
Josie: I’m not certain we could steal a ship…
Rhi: That would also probably be too much.
Josie: Yes, but I’m certain there are smaller transports with replaceable folk inside them.
Minna: They have to get from the Docks to other places somehow.
Rhi: Yeah, and I think in order to find out how that all works you can kinda start poking around with your Gather Info.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. Who wants to do what?
Kim: I can roll a Consort for my Gather Info to see if anyone owes Blaire any favors. I doubt it, but…
Rhi: Well, do you maybe… I mean, I feel like maybe talking to The Reconciled, because a lot of them are pretty highly placed in society, and the leviathan hunters are owned exclusively by the nobility of Duskwall.
Kim: Ah, okay, yeah.
Rhi: So you could see if they have any…
Kim: I will 100% consult with them.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: [laughs, claps] Gang.
Rhi: Yeah?
Kim: Double 1s.
Rhi: [laughs] Oh no.
Minna: Oh buddy.
Josie: Oh no.
Kim: It’s Gather Info, so it’s fine.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, nothing…
Josie: You do not have good luck with them.
Rhi: No.
Kim: They don’t like me. [laughs]
Rhi: Some of them do… the ones who aren’t in charge. If you talk to Lady Karina… I think that in this case it’s less that she is annoyed with Blaire as that she’s just busy doing other stuff and doesn’t have a lot of time.
Kim: Yeah, I can see that.
Rhi: I know how she’s gonna play this. She is supportive, because she ,like… One of the goals of The Reconciled is to try to reduce the number of feral ghosts that are around, because feral ghosts cause a number of problems.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: You know, they’re not safe, and having this gang war and this area of the Docks that is just so highly contested and not well-maintained is causing a lot more death than there would normally be, so she’s like, this is good. She also is like hey—she doesn’t tell this to Blaire, but her motive for the information she’s gonna give you, I can use this to fuck over a rival. [laughs]
Kim: Fair.
Rhi: I will point this young, eager go-getter at some noble family I don’t care for.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Okay then.
Rhi: So let me try to figure out who she’s gonna aim you at… Somebody wanna give me a family name for a noble family in the city?
Kim: Sinclair.
Rhi: Okay. Have we used Sinclair for something before?
Josie: I don’t think so.
Kim: We might have.
Rhi: Well, whatever. People have the same last name. it’s fine.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: There’s like a million Smiths out there.
Minna: Myra Keel and Mara Keel.
Rhi: Yeah, exactly.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, she points you at the Sinclair family. They’re a more minor noble family. They only have a couple leviathan hunter ships. One of their ships is due to come into dock fairly soon, which means it’ll be coming in from Skovlan, it’ll have lots of nice, fresh, refined electroplasm in the hull that will need to be transported out. She’s not really able to give you a lot of details about how that transport will work, she can just kind of give you the date and the time about when that is supposed to come in so you have a window to aim for when it will be starting to be off-loaded off of the ship.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, and then she’s like… What I’m picturing is that she was leaving the Reconciled hideout, and Blaire was coming in, and they have this conversation in the hall outside the door.
Rhi (as Karina): [inhales] I have to go. There’s a carriage waiting for me. Uh, good luck!
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] And leaves.
Kim: Basically.
Rhi: Yeah. You’ve got, you know, a target at least to aim at. Myra or Minx, do you have ideas?
Josie: Didn’t Liege Greer’s wife get rich because of leviathan hunter stuff?
Rhi: I mean, yeah, all of the nobility have leviathan hunters.
Josie: Every nobility?
Rhi: Yeah. That is how you are nobility in the city, basically.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: Yeah. The Evermars I think are kind of at a similar position to the Sinclairs, they only have a few ships, but that still makes you enough money to be quite well-off and considered nobility.
Josie (as Minx): What if I, or we, just had tea with the Evermars?
Minna: [uncertain hum]
Rhi: Oh, okay, find out how the business works? Okay! [laughs]
Josie: Yeah. Last time we asked them for basically pro bono help. I’m just asking for information this time.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. I think that makes sense, just chatting with them about how, how does your business work.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Yeah. I think you could try and do that. that sounds like consorting.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Yeah, so I think that you’re not able to meet with Lady Verona who is the one who actually kind of manages the business. That’s Greer’s wife. You do get to meet with Greer though. They are happy to see you. They’ve been down to check on the clinic a few times. They’re very pleased with how things are going.
Josie: Despite the strange sounds coming from upstairs? [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, Seeks is more than happy to explain the work that she is doing, it’s just that nobody else really understands it. Everyone knows it involves leeches, and kelp, and some kind of what appears to maybe be blood magic, but at least it’s her blood and not the blood of the patients, so it’s an improvement.
Josie: [laughs] Yay.
Minna: [smiling] I love this situation so much.
Rhi: Yeah, so Greer’s happy to chat with you over tea. Are you doing this at their estate?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. I think that the two of you are having tea in the drawing room and you can hear running footsteps and kids laughing upstairs.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: And Greer is just like:
Rhi (as Greer): Their new tutor I think might not last terribly long…
Josie (as Minx): [chuckles] Oh dear.
Rhi (as Greer): Well, they’re very rambunctious and need a sort of firm… someone who’s willing to say no, and I don’t think that she is willing to say no, so… we’ll have a talk after. I’ll go talk to her after this.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I suppose we’ll see.
Rhi: So, you’re just trying to circle around to how the electroplasm business works.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Greer I think is a little… one, is not as directly involved in the business. They know a decent amount about it just, you know, they’ve been married for a while. I don’t remember how long I said. Ten or twelve years?
Josie: Yeah, I think it was ten.
Rhi: So like, you pick stuff up just by osmosis.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: They’re also, like… Greer still has a little bit of discomfort with the source of their wealth. It’s not to the point where they’re gonna give it up, because they live a much more comfortable life than they did before they got married, and it’s a good life for their children, but talking about the leviathan hunters they’re a little, like, you can tell that it’s not their favorite thing to talk about.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But they do give you some information. Basically, when the ships come in each family has their section of the docks and they have their own staff and their own guards and whatnot, so each noble family has their own people who are responsible for coming onto the ship and getting… I’m imagining probably a lot of pipework set up, where the ship comes into dock and on either side of the dock are these big pipes that will latch onto the hull and people have to climb out there and bolt them into place and then the electroplasm is pumped out from there into big vats and barrels and stuff, and then those are loaded onto wagons and the like. I was gonna say trucks and I’m like no, they’re not there yet. [chuckles]
Josie: [chuckles]
Rhi: Loaded up onto wagons. Sometimes loaded onto barges if it’s gonna be moved along the river, if they have a large amount that they’re trying to move along the river traffic. The whole process usually takes, to load up a wagon, I would say usually takes a few hours, and then, you know, the wagons head off. The wagons do not move very quickly because they are laden with very heavy barrels of electroplasm, and as a result they tend to be pretty heavily guarded.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Since you’ve got this slow-moving target. You’re not the only people who have thought that hey, stealing an electroplasm wagon is a good idea.
Josie: Uh-huh, but what about those barges though?
Rhi: The barges are gonna be laden with a lot more electroplasm, and also pretty heavily guarded, slow-moving. Those are the ones that are usually heading out to the lightning barriers, because it’s just massive amounts of the stuff. The stuff that’s moving throughout the city tends to be more for private use, commercial use, that sort of thing.
Josie: Right. Okay, okay. A plan is coming together.
Rhi: [laughs] Any other questions you wanna ask about that?
Josie: No. I think Minx just wants to have a nice tea with Liege Greer.
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah. I think it’s generally a pretty nice time. I think it does get cut short because there’s the sound of something breaking upstairs, and Greer is like:
Rhi (as Greer): Okay! I’m sorry. I have to go.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): I understand completely.
Rhi (as Greer): I need to go deal with my children, and their tutor, and… I just wanted a break. [exhales] Okay! Sorry. I’ll see you another time.
Rhi: And will see you to the door and then rush off to the stairs. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Myra, what do you wanna do to investigate this situation?
Minna: What is the plan that Minx has coming together?
Josie: I think if we are subtle enough and consult the Gondoliers and the knowledge we have of the under-passages of the city, we could simply siphon a couple barrels off barges that come by a certain stop…
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: …and maybe that barge regularly just stops there for a second, and then keeps going under a bridge.
Rhi: Offload barrels to the Gondoliers?
Josie: Yeah, or if we can get close enough, off into a catacomb entrance and then you roll it.
Minna: [smiling] Okay. So I think I’m gonna talk to the Gondoliers and see if they know the places where their routes intersect with those carts.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah.
Minna: I think that’s a Consort, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: That’s a critical.
Rhi: Good lord.
Minna: I’m rolling four dice plus an extra one for Gathering Info.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, Jesus. I think you head over to Gondoliers HQ and start chatting with them, and I think similar to the response that Blaire got from Lady Karina, when you explain this plan to the Gondoliers they’re like yes, this is awesome, except they don’t have an ulterior motive and they actually want to help you. [chuckles] So the Gondoliers are like this is great, we love everything about this, we will definitely help. I think what you get is not only are they able to tell you where these barges pass by but they are willing to set up obstacles to slow them down.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Because I don’t think that the barges—The way that I’m thinking of the barges is that, like, you know, they’re pretty big, and it would be, like, if you’re in a city with a river in it and a big ship is coming through and the bridges go up, it stops traffic, similarly I think these barges just stop water traffic. Like, the Gondoliers or whoever else are just, you gotta move off to the side and wait, or it’s like if you’re driving and a train is going by. That’s probably a better example. You just have to wait for this thing to get out of your way. They don’t typically stop very much, but the Gondoliers are gonna be willing to arrange for a few pauses along a route.
Josie: Hmm.
Rhi: They can’t do a ton, because then they will end up getting into trouble, but they can arrange for some points along the route where the barge will stop and you all can, however you want to, offload some of these barrels.
Josie: Mm-hmm. What is the timeframe for getting the ectoplasm?
Rhi: Oh, up to the Docks you mean, for Ink Row?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: There’s not really a set deadline, but the general feeling in the meeting was the sooner we can get everything together the sooner we can move on this and the sooner Bazso is able to get some breathing room. They can start pushing back on some of the other gangs. There’s not a solid deadline, but you also don’t have forever.
Josie: Right. If this is a regular occurrence we don’t need to take all that is necessary from one barge. That would be kind of rough, right?
Rhi: I think that what you get is that the Gondoliers aren’t really able, they’re not gonna be able to do this thing where they can get in and slow the barges down or stop them or get in close to help you offload the barrels more than one.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Maybe later on somebody could come in with their own little rowboat and nick a couple barrels and then leave, but I think that the Gondoliers are like, we can help you get a fair amount in one go.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: Yeah. I like this plan. You’re stealing gasoline, basically. [laughs]
Josie: Yay.
Kim: If you see a car with this sticker it means you’re legally allowed to siphon its gas.
Josie: Sucking that gas. I love that.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: That’s a good one.
Rhi: But yeah, any other prep stuff y’all wanna do?
Kim: No.
Josie: Eh, we have retroactive mechanics, let’s go for it.
Rhi: Yeah. This is gonna be a 3d6 engagement roll. Huh…
Kim: I don’t like that.
Josie: Uh-oh.
Rhi: Three 3s.
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: [laughs] Huh?!
Kim: I think the dice missed us.
Rhi: Um… Okay, okay. So you’re gonna be starting in a desperate position.
Kim: Why?
Rhi: Because the dice have spoken, and I apologize?
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I didn’t do it. It was the dice.
## Score [0:34:40]
Rhi: How do you think you… Tell me about how you get onto the barge, which I’m imagining this is like, it’s big. It is a big, big, big barge with these massive, massive vats, or closed big containers of electroplasm.
Josie: I think we’re maybe already on the canal in a boat near where we want to make it happen, and you know, we just pull off to the side of the road like any…
Rhi: Yeah, like you’re supposed to.
Josie: …any car with sirens behind it, yeah, and just wait for it to roll right past us until we’re at the point where we want to climb on.
Rhi: I’m guessing probably more towards the back.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So yeah, I think that one of the Gondoliers will bring you up alongside of it. You all hop on. They give you a wave as they’re pulling away. It seems to be going pretty good at first, you’re sneaking around examining the situation, and then you… What do I wanna have here?
Josie: [coughs] Apprentices.
Rhi: Huh?
Josie: [coughs more deliberately] Apprentices.
Rhi: Huh…
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I mean, I did say… yeah. Okay. Thank you for helping with that. [laughs]
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: So, you’re sneaking around, you’re casing out the joint, kinda figuring out where things are. None of you have ever been on one of these barges before. I think the three of you come around a turn between two of the large vats of electroplasm, and as you do that, standing in front of you is Clave backed by a pair of Umbra Hunters.
Minna: Huh!
Josie: Oh!
Rhi: And then behind you, so you all are kinda flanked, Wester steps in also with, I think he has three guards with him.
Josie: Is he visibly wounded from our last encounter?
Rhi: I mean, he got kneed in the balls real bad.
Josie: Well, remember, I also had a long one-on-one fight with him that ended up with his bloody handprint on my… [laughs]
Rhi: That’s right! I forgot about… You fought him when you were rescuing Myra. I forgot about that. You’re correct. Yeah, I think he’s got a scar that comes up from under the collar of his shirt and goes up his neck, almost to his jawline.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I imagine a lot of the other scars are probably hidden under his clothes, but he’s got that visible from where you just kinda slashed him one.
Josie: I like to think we’re in mid-sneaking pose—
Rhi: [laughing] yeah, exactly, and they’re just, step out, boxing you in.
Josie: So Minx just kind of looks to both sides, straightens up, and is like:
Josie (as Minx): Well, plus side, I’ll be able to finish this one off today.
Josie: She says, pointing at Wester.
Rhi: He just gives you a big, toothy grin.
Rhi (as Wester): Funny. That’s what I was thinking.
Josie: Have they made aggressive motion besides blocking us off?
Rhi: They’re all holding various bladed weapons…
Josie: Okay. Good to know they’re all bladed and not gunpowder. I think Minx is just gonna say:
Josie (as Minx): So how dramatic do we wanna make this?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, have you met us?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I’m just trying to make sure everyone’s on the same page, because we could do the Circle thing with a one-on-one duel, or you could haul us off somewhere. You haven’t raised the alarm yet, so I assume you want something.
Rhi: I think one of the Umbra Hunters is gonna throw a knife at you. [laughs]
Josie: Okay. [laughs] Blast.
Rhi: So, I’m gonna need you to roll a resistance. Prowess, I believe, is gonna be…
Josie: Yep, sure is.
Rhi: Or you’re gonna take harm.
Josie: I got a 6, so don’t I heal a stress? Oh no, I didn’t get a critical.
Rhi: No, only if you get a critical, but yeah, tell me how you evade the harm altogether.
Josie: I think I was kinda just generally pointing at the group and turned, like “oh, but that must mean you want something.” The guy throws a knife and I just pull my hand back, like [yelps], and it stabs into the wall.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, yeah, they’re starting to move in on you at this point. Violence is imminent. What are y’all gonna do?
Josie: I has sword.
Minna: [squirms nervously]
Rhi: Has Minx told Myra and/or Blaire about her arrangement with Clave?
Josie: I think she’s told them she found an informant. She hasn’t had an opportunity to tell Myra yet, because that’s kind of a heavy conversation.
Rhi: Waiting for the right time, and now Clave is here, with a sword.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: All right. Minx is going for some stabbins?
Josie: yes.
Rhi: Okay. Who are you stabbins?
Josie: Um… shit. I really wanna kill Wester, but also it would be smart for me to go towards the ones behind Clave. Hmm… Yeah, I think I’m gonna stab one of the ones attending to Clave.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead and roll that. You are still in a desperate situation.
Josie: Oh yay, xp.
Rhi: Heh, so yeah, mark that.
Josie: Critical.
Rhi: Jesus. Uh…
Josie: Four dots is nice.
Rhi: Yeah… You will take out one of them just flat out.
Josie: Yeah. I think he’s advancing towards me, but I just drop low, kick his feet out from under him, and as I’m rising and he’s falling I just cut his neck.
Rhi: Oof. Okay. So he’s bleeding out.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: What are Myra and Blaire doing?
Kim: You know what, let’s go with the throwing knives again, because that’s always fun.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: I’m just gonna, you know, ninja star these people.
Rhi: Who are you aiming at?
Kim: Whoever’s standing.
Rhi: There’s four guards, Clave, and Wester.
Kim: I’m gonna aim for Wester.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Does Finesse make sense for this?
Rhi: Um… I don’t think you have enough distance for Finesse. I think this is more a Skirmish situation.
Kim: Cool. I’ll push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: And this is desperate, right?
Rhi: Uh-huh.
Kim: Double 4s?
Rhi: Okay! You do it, but there’s a consequence. Let me—Okay. Well… Hmm. Something just occurred to me with Josie’s roll. I think you actually need to not kill your guy, Josie.
Josie: Why is that?
Rhi: Because that sets off the death bell.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Oh shit, that’s right.
Josie: Oh!
Minna: We’re in Duskwall.
Kim: We have that.
Josie: Yeah. I think maybe then I drop low and just… He might die later, because I’m slicing the back of his thighs, but… [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. He’s not gonna die right now. Unfortunately, the reason that this occurred to me, is Blaire does kill the guy she throws the throwing knife at.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: Well, you were aiming at Wester, right?
Kim: Yes. Yeah.
Rhi: I think, since you got a 4, Wester dodges out of the way and the guard standing right behind him takes the knife in the throat and collapses.
Kim: Ooh, whoopsie. Heh.
Rhi: I think there’s kind of this moment where everyone freezes, and looks, and he falls and is gurgling and clutching at his throat and then goes still, and there’s this long silent pause… that is broken by the distant clang of the death bell.
Kim: [exhales] This is what we in the industry call a whoopsie.
Rhi: [laughs] Starting a clock for Spirit Wardens Arrive.
Kim: No!
Minna: Mmm…
Rhi: Let me think… You’re on the river, so they’re gonna have a slightly harder time getting to you, so I’m gonna say you’re at 1 out of 8.
Kim: I don’t like experiencing consequences to my actions.
[laughter]
Rhi: Well, then you should have played a different game, because that is the core mechanic of this one. Myra, what are you doing now in this situation?
Minna: [deflating nervous exhale]
Rhi: You’ve got your old buddies here.
Minna: Yeah, don’t like it.
Rhi: No. Well, the gang isn’t all here, they didn’t bring Ojal.
Minna: Thank God, frankly.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Minna: Yeah, I’m gonna close and I think try and take out Wester.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: And by take out I mean I’m going in with the baton.
Rhi: Okay. You’re attacking not to kill.
Minna: Yeah. I’m gonna roll my Skirmish…
Rhi: So, I will say, let me… you’ve taken out two guards. There were five, so you’re down to… This is still a desperate position for you all, and you’re at standard effect.
Minna: I will push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Ugh, that’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay! I think I’m gonna say that you have reduced effect. Wester sees you coming and brings up his own blade to block, and I think you’re basically like… I think you manage to get some taps in on him.
Minna: Can I–?
Rhi: Yeah? Go ahead.
Minna: I think I know, actually. He brings his blade up and catches my baton with it, but I am able to get him with some kicks type situation.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. [laughs] It’s that thing where you’ve crossed weapons and are staring at each other dramatically and you just kick him in the shins.
Minna: yeah, I mean, I’m not here to play, I’m not here to fight nicely.
Rhi: No, you’re here to win. So yeah, reduced effect. You hurt him, getting kicked in the shins hurts, but he’s not out of the fight. All right, who is next?
Josie: Well, someone has been killed.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Spirit Wardens are coming anyway.
Rhi: [laughing] Oh no! Josie!
Kim: Ohh… Josie, no, don’t do this…
Josie: Well no, this isn’t a roll to kill someone.
Rhi: Uh-huh?
Kim: But?
Josie: Where spatially is Clave?
Rhi: She’s fairly close to you, because you went after one of the guards on her.
Josie: Mm-hmm. There’s not really a way to make this stealthy, so I’m gonna kinda just count on the fact that there’s a bunch of chaos happening. As I move to lock blades with the other guy my roll is gonna be a Sway.
Minna: [delighted laugh]
Rhi: Okay?
Josie: To whisper to Clave.
Josie (as Minx): They don’t need to live to tell the tale.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay. That’s still gonna be desperate, standard effect. Well, let me think. I think it’s actually gonna be reduced effect because of Clave’s sort of inner logic on the situation.
Josie: Right. Can I push myself to standard effect?
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. I think you whisper that. I’m imagining that you whisper that as you move past Clave, and she sort of turns with you, and I think you sort of…
Josie: Aw, but can she not turn with me?
Rhi: Oh, yeah.
Josie: Because then we can get the dramatic passing by each other, talking while facing different directions.
Rhi: Yeah. I think there’s a moment though where you lock eyes and she is very hesitant, like you can see in her eyes she’s just kinda like, that there’s a lot of doubt there, but she gives you the barest fraction of a nod.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Unfortunately, because you got a 5, there is a consequence, and that consequence is that while you’re having this locked eyes split second your guard is down and the other guard stabs you.
Josie: Oh heavens!
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs, surprised yelp]
Josie: I distracted myself!
Rhi: You’re gonna take level 2 harm, Stabbed in the Ribs.
Josie: I think it’s actually better for me to take the harm here. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, I was gonna say, I think you’re getting up there on stress.
Josie: I’m stabbed {pronounced stabbid}.
Rhi: Okay. SO yeah, you’re gonna be at -1 die on, I mean, you got stabbed in the ribs so a lot of your physical stuff you’re gonna be at -1.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Yeah, but… I will say, how Clave’s assistance will manifest is not necessarily gonna be her dramatically turning.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: I am gonna take that into account, it just might not be immediately obvious. I just wanna put that out there.
Josie: Okay!
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Because she’s still kind of like, I see where your head’s at, but there’s a chance that we don’t kill anyone and I need to maintain my cover, so she’s gonna play it subtle for the moment.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: So Myra or Blaire, what do you wanna do?
Kim: I can mark off my lightning hooks and give zapping a go. Is that Skirmish again?
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: I’m not a fight girl. This is desperate again, right?
Rhi: No, risky, you’re in risky.
Kim: Ah. Okay.
Rhi: Actually for you, because they’re fine lightning hooks, it’s gonna be greater effect.
Kim: Oh, dope. [snaps] One!
Minna: [gasps] Buddy…
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: [groans]
Rhi: Okay, so when you said you were gonna use the lightning hooks the first thing that came to my mind was what happens with lightning hooks near big vats of electroplasm.
Kim: Hmm. Good point.
Josie: Oh dear.
Kim: Good point.
Rhi: So, you pop out your lightning hooks, you flip them on, because they’ve got little electroplasm power packs on them, and they spark to life. You swing at one of the guards and she dodges out of the way, and your swing keeps going… and I think hooks into the side of one of the vats of electroplasm.
Kim: That’s what we in the industry call another whoopsie.
Rhi: [laughs] And the lightning crackles out over the side of the tank, and I think you jerk your hook back very quickly, and like… the lightning hooks are not like, the hook part of it isn’t really that sharp because that’s not how you use the weapon, but it does have a little bit of a point to it, and there’s just a… you can see this little crack, and there’s this slow drop of electroplasm forming, and we’re gonna start a second clock…
Kim: Yeah?
Rhi: …called Ghost Hoard Arrives, 1 out of 4.
Minna: Oh!
Rhi: You have just opened up a buffet.
Minna: Nooo!
Kim: Yeah… Yeah.
Rhi: A bunch of hungry ghosts are going to descend and start to feed in rather short order unless you can do something about this situation.
Kim: [pinched] Cool. Cool. This is fine. Love it.
Josie: Everything’s good.
Kim: Everything is awesome…
Rhi: [chuckling] Myra, what would you like to do?
Minna: Uh… Wester.
Rhi: Yeah, gonna keep going after him?
Minna: Yeah. What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Ooh. Hmm. Spirit Wardens are getting closer. I’m gonna tick that clock up another 2.
Minna: Honestly, given the other clock, yeah, because they’ll have a distraction I’m sure.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. [laughs] If you just wait long enough they’ll both arrive at the same time and fight each other. Spirit Wardens Arrive is now at 3 out of 8.
Minna: That’s a 4. What I was going to try to do is knock Wester off the boat.
Rhi: On a 4, you do it but there’s a consequence. You are trying to just knock him off the side?
Minna: Mm-hmm. Do I get knocked off too?
Rhi: Yeah! Let’s go with that.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: You shove him off, but as he’s falling he grabs you and drags you down with him.
Minna: Yup. Mm-hmm. Ugh! [laughs]
Rhi: So you have both fallen into the river. Sploosh!
Minna (as Myra): [coughs] God damn you, Wester!
Rhi: [laughing] He’s also kind of flailing to get himself up out of the river. And yeah, so… I think—I’m gonna make a fortune roll real quick. Minx, you see Clave’s eyes dart to the side when Wester goes over the side.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: She looks towards where he fell and then looks towards the other guards, and for a second you think that she’s gonna turn and start attacking the other guards, but she doesn’t.
Josie: But she’s thinking about it?
Rhi: I think what she actually does is she disengages from the combat area entirely and is gonna run over and reach out a hand over the water as if she’s going to help Wester.
Josie: All right.
Rhi: So, yeah, Myra’s overboard, you’ve got three guards still, Clave is no longer engaged in the fight, the death bell is still ringing, and you have a slow leak of electroplasm happening.
Josie: None of that is good, I notice.
Rhi: Nope! [laughs]
Josie: I notice that none of that is good.
Rhi: No, no it’s not.
Josie: Uh… I really wanna get Myra out of the water.
Rhi: I mean, yeah, go for it.
Josie: But then I leave Blaire with three guards.
Rhi: That is true.
Kim: Because if you don’t go after Myra I will.
Josie: Okay, in that case, am I directly engaged with one of them?
Rhi: Pretty much, yeah.
Josie: Okay. I just wanna try and kill that guy.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead and roll, still risky, standard effect.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay! I don’t think that you kill him outright, but you get him out of the way. There’s shoving and stabbing and he goes down in a bloody heap, similar to the first guy that you stabbed.
Josie: Can—
Rhi: Oh. Sorry. Go ahead.
Josie: Can it be, like, I shove his blade to the side with mine and then I just slam his head into the side of the boat?
Rhi: Yeah! [laughs]
Josie: [laughs, makes echoing impact noise]
Rhi: I like that. Yeah. He’s out of commission more or less, or at least stunned for the moment, is not gonna be interfering. Blaire?
Kim: Yes?
Rhi: Did you wanna go and try and help Myra?
Kim: Yeah. What would I have to roll to, you know, get into or close to the water, hold out a hand, etcetera, etcetera?
Rhi: I’m gonna treat this as a setup move. You can go over and reach out your hand, or if you can find a rope, or if you have one you could throw her a rope and we’ll treat that as you can make a roll to do a setup action so that Myra will be in a better position to get herself out of the water.
Kim: Okay. Let me see. What would rope…
Rhi: I don’t know if rope is on your, like—
Kim: It’s not.
Rhi: Well, you know what—Hang on, let me look at a character sheet.
Kim: I think it’s part of—
Rhi: You’ve got burglary tools, right?
Kim: Do I have burglary gear…?
Rhi: Something like that.
Kim: Yes, I have burglary gear.
Minna: There’s also climbing gear.
Rhi: Either one of those would include rope. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah, I’ll go with burglary gear and toss out a rope to Myra.
Rhi: Okay. So, give me a Prowl. Prowl is kind of the catch-all physical thing.
Kim: Two!
Josie: No!
Rhi: Okay, so basically the consequence of this is that you throw the rope out and I think it catches on some debris in the water and it ends up not in a position that can help Myra.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Myra. You’re in the water. What you see is Clave rushes over and holds out a hand, but she locks eyes with you, not Wester.
Minna: Oh shit.
Rhi: So you can do with that information as you like.
Minna: [under her breath] Is there some kind of insight roll? [laughs] I’ve been playing too much D&D.
Rhi: Yeah, let me…
Minna: I think it’s a narrative choice in Blades. I think this is a narrative choice.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah, I think you can decide.
Minna: Here’s the thing, I don’t know that Myra can swim really. [giggles]
Rhi: Yeah, that makes sense.
Minna: This might be her only choice, so I think she’s going to flail over in that direction, and if Clave happens to catch her hand that’s just something that’s going to happen.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. This will be Prowl, risky position. I’m gonna say greater effect, because though Myra may not be clear on it you are still getting some help here.
Minna: Five.
Rhi: I think that you flail over and grab onto Clave’s arm, and she is just like:
Rhi (as Clave): Ugh! Get out of the way!
Rhi: And swings you to the side, but like, you’re still on her arm, and her swinging you to the side brings you closer to the boat, so basically she swung you over so you can grab onto the thing, onto the side of the barge.
Minna: Uh-huh.
Rhi: And then she yanks her arm back.
Rhi (as Clave): Wester! Wester, come on!
Rhi: So, she’s trying to make it look like she hasn’t helped you, but she has helped you. I’ll leave it up to you if Myra can kind of pick up on what happened.
Minna: I don’t think she understands what’s happening, because this has never happened to her before. [chuckles] Clave has never willingly helped her.
Rhi: The complication is that I’m ticking up the Ghost Hoard Arrives clock. It is now at 2 out of 4.
Minna: Valid.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, you are back on the boat. You are drenched. Your clothes are ruined, because I feel like the rivers in Duskwall—
Minna: Very polluted.
Rhi: Probably have a lot in common with the river in Chicago back in the late 1800s, early 1900s, where the river would routinely just catch on fire.
Minna: Hmm!
Rhi: A chicken could walk across it.
Minna: Oh no.
Josie: What the fuck?
Rhi: It was so polluted.
Minna: Why did the chicken cross the river?
Rhi: [chuckles]
Minna: Because it could.
Rhi: Because of all the cholera.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: But yeah, the river is disgusting. You should probably go to Seeks after this and just get a whole bunch of shots for various things. She’ll just cover you gently in leeches, it’ll be fine.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: You’re back on the barge. Clave and Wester are kind of occupied with each other getting Wester out of the river. There are two guards left in action at this point, so you all can do as you like with them.
Josie: Well, I think I like the option that includes stabbing.
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, that does seem to be Minx’s primary…
Josie: hey, I tried the talky approach. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: It worked-ish.
Rhi: It worked for one person in this group.
Josie: Oh, well I should have rolled one less dice on that, but it’s still a 5.
Rhi: Yeah, even if we knock off—cutting off literally any of them still gives you a 5.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: Okay, so I think you and the guard just kinda square off for a while and you’re able to knock him out again, similar to the other one. I’m imagining at some point you flip your sword around and just clock him upside the head.
Josie: Yeah~
Rhi: But it’s time consuming, so I’m ticking up the Spirit Warden clock to 4 out of 8.
Josie: Woo.
Rhi: The last guard looks at the situation before him where one of his compatriots is dead, three of them are unconscious and bleeding, and the people who are supposedly in charge are like, you know, one of them is getting fished out of the river. He just sort of considers the situation and is gonna dodge around you as much as he can and run over to Clave, and he grabs her shoulder in very much a “we gotta go” gesture.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: So it seems like he is trying to bail out, and Clave looks like… is agreeing with him. [laughs] Like you see a lot of nodding from her. I think that they’re grabbing Wester and pulling him out.
Josie (as Minx): All right. We need to get out the barrels now.
Rhi: Okay. Basically what happens is they pull Wester out of the water and there’s this moment where it’s a very western movie thing where there’s the two groups of three of you on either side of the screen and just this long expanse between you, and Wester dripping and covered in river gunk is going for his blade again, and I think Clave puts out her hand, just shakes her head, and then I think she and the guard have to march him off. They move towards the very back of the barge where you’re guessing they probably have a boat, but Clave doesn’t really give you all any special look as she’s leaving. She seems to be focusing her attention on getting Wester away without him breaking off and picking a fight again that doesn’t look too good.
Josie: [chuckles] Right.
Rhi: Oh man, he was bleeding when he went in there. He’s definitely got some kind of gnarly infection.
Kim: Oh no!
Josie: Haha, get wrecked.
Rhi: [laughs] Wester will die three weeks from now. No, I don’t know. Yeah, they hustle off, apparently deciding better to live and fight another day than continue to fight the lot of you. You still have a dead body, you still have some unconscious bodies, and you still have some electroplasm dripping out of a thing, and also, as Minx pointed out, you all need to get barrels—which I think there are barrels on the barge, I’m just gonna say for ease of making this work. But yeah, you need to start loading up electroplasm.
Josie: I just wanna go for it.
Rhi: Okay. You still have a bit of time before you get to the first Gondolier checkpoint, but not a ton of time. In order to do this stealthily, getting barrels and hooking them up on this machinery, and filling them with electroplasm, and then getting them to the edge of the barge, in order to do that stealthily I think it’ll be Prowl checks.
Josie: Okay. Do we maybe wanna do a group Prowl about it?
Kim: Uh… yeah.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Who’s gonna lead?
Minna: I can lead.
Rhi: Yeah. This is gonna still be risky. The immediate threat of Salia’s operatives is removed, but there still are guards on this boat, so risky position, standard.
Kim: Five.
Rhi: Okay, five.
Kim: My first good roll of the night.
Rhi: Yay.
Josie: This would be affected by my stab wound, right?
Rhi: Yes. Yes it would.
Josie: In that case, I’m gonna push myself to get back to one die.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay.
Minna: I’m at 5 also.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Ooh. Nice. Okay.
Minna: I take 0 stress.
Rhi: That means you got a 6. Yeah, you take no—Great! [laughs] You take no stress, and you do it. So, I am gonna say… let’s see. I’m gonna roll to see how many barrels you’re able to get filled before you hit the first drop-off point. They’re the kind of barrels that you all dealt with previously the last time you stole this stuff, so they’re oil drum sized, so it’s a not insubstantial amount of electroplasm. You’re able to roll them over to the side and then a couple Gondoliers pull up beside you and they’re able to help you ease them into the boat and then they will take off. So, you’ve gotten two barrels, and I probably should have set this previously, I think that the request was probably for like four minimum, six or more would be ideal.
Josie: Okay. That’s actually less than I was thinking.
Rhi: Also, I was thinking about it, I’m like yeah, if you can get another couple, but at this point the Gondoliers are not gonna be able to do another pickup for a bit, so you may have to just sort of hide out and wait, find another way of getting the barrels off of the thing.
Minna: What do we wanna… Do we wanna try and find boats?
Josie: Sure.
Kim: That works.
Josie: I mean, are there any lifeboats? Is that standard operating procedure in this time period?
Rhi: No~ [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I think also they figure you’re on a river, you can make it to shore, you’ll be fine.
Kim: How far away are the Gondoliers?
Rhi: The next point where they’re gonna be able to sort of, where they have a chokepoint set up that’s gonna slow the barge down, is probably I’m gonna say about ten minutes away.
Kim: Hmm.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So enough time for you to fill up more barrels if you wanted to just do that and keep filling up barrels.
Josie: Yeah, I mean, no guards have come back. Well, no, we don’t have time for that, because the Spirit Wardens are gonna come for the barge.
Rhi: Yeah. You do have a ticking clock.
Minna: Can I argue for a Study?
Rhi: Sure, to do what?
Minna: To find boats. Maybe I have looked up how barges, like, where they might keep extra boats.
Rhi: Do you wanna do a flashback? You could do that as a flashback.
Minna: Sure. Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, I think that makes sense. That’s gonna be a no-stress flashback. Myra is exactly the sort of person who, upon learning that they’re gonna be sneaking onto a barge, would have gone and looked up how barges work.
Minna: Mm-hmm. Knowledge is power.
Rhi: [giggles]
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: Yeah. I think you found where they usually have a, you know, a dinghy, small little vessel that can leave the barge. The problem is that it is at the front of the barge where all the lights are and the barge pilot is… Do barges have captains? How do barges work…? Anyway! [laughs] The person responsible for driving the barge is up there, and then there’s the crew that it responsible for off-loading the electroplasm when they arrive. There’s a lot of people up at the front, but there’s also a boat.
Minna: How sneaky can we be?
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I mean, kind of sneaky?
Rhi: Well, here’s the thing, Myra looks like she just fell in the river, because she just fell in the river.
Josie: Uh-huh?
Rhi: There’s a possibility that she could claim to be a person who fell in the river and is in need of help.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: To just sort of stumble up there and be like oh my God, please help me.
Kim: You could.
Minna: Yeah…
Josie: If you’re comfortable making that lie.
Minna: Yeah… I got a 2 in Sway. That works.
Rhi: Yeah. That’s gonna be, I’m gonna say that’s risky, standard effect.
Minna: I think I’m gonna push myself again.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Five.
Rhi: Okay. Tell me how this works, because I think what it is, what I’m picturing is there’s kind of an enclosed space where the generators are for the lights and where the pilot is, but then around that there’s just sort of crates and benches and a lot more barrels are stored up here and some machinery, and this is where the crew just kinda hangs out until they’re needed, so there’s just a bunch of barge workers sitting around chatting, probably playing cards or whatever. [laughing] And you… Tell us how you approach this and what do you say?
Minna: So Myra walks up, she is soaking.
Minna (as Myra): [shivering] I need a ride to shore. If I could just—
Rhi (as worker): Oh! M-Miss, oh! What happened to you? Did you fall in?
Minna (as Myra): [breathy] Yeah, it was really…
Rhi (as worker): Oh, oh, yeah… Oh, you are just—
Minna (as Myra): Don’t. Don’t come any closer. You’re not gonna want—It’s, ugh.
Rhi (as worker): Yeah, ugh…
Rhi: There’s a woman who looks like she’s probably in her mid-30s or late 30s who starts towards you and then turns around.
Rhi (as woman): Get a blanket or something!
Rhi: And one of the other ones runs off. She does come over to you but pulls on gloves as she does.
Rhi (as woman): You’re not the first person we’ve had go over the side. Come on.
Rhi: She will walk you over and sits you down and somebody comes over with a blanket. Somebody brings you a mug of something.
Rhi (as worker): Here, rinse your mouth out. You probably got all kinds of horrible stuff in there.
Rhi: You know, they’re being very kind, they 100% believe you, but when you bring up I need a ride to shore they’re like, uh, we can’t.
Minna (as Myra): I have… I don’t have money, but I can trade. I have this very nice whiskey. [coughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Um…
Minna: Do I roll Consort on it?
Rhi: I think what’s gonna happen—Initially, their response is, because you got a 5, the consequence is that they’re not gonna take you to shore, they’re not gonna stop and like, you know, they’d have to stop the barge so that some of their people could take the boat. They’re not gonna do that. I like the whiskey idea. [laughs]
Minna: What can I trade the whiskey for? If I offer the whiskey is there something they can offer me?
Rhi: I think if you offer to trade them the whiskey for one of them rowing you to shore…
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: That is possible, but you’re gonna need to make a roll for it.
Minna: I have this Consort roll right here.
Rhi: Mm-hmm, and it’s a fine bottle of whiskey, right?
Minna: Yep.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m gonna give you greater effect on that. I think you pull it out of your bag and somebody leans in and lets out a very low, impressed whistle.
Minna: It’s a 6.
Josie: Why do you have a fine bottle of whiskey?
Minna: [smiling] It’s on my character sheet. I never get a chance to use it.
Josie: Huh.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s one of the Spider items. [laughs]
Josie: What a weird one.
Kim: Wow, that’s amazing.
Minna: If I’ve used it all I think I used it while meeting with Bazso.
Rhi: Yeah. So, did you do your roll?
Minna: I did. I got a 6.
Rhi: Oh my God.
Minna: I have four in Consort!
Josie: Good job, Myra!
Rhi: That’s so… This is incredible. Okay. [laughs] I love this so much. So you pull this out and I think the woman who had initially helped you over whistles.
Rhi (as woman): Okay, uh… I can take you over to shore, but I’m just gonna have to drop you off wherever we get, because then I gotta bring the boat right back. Is that okay?
Minna (as Myra): That’s fine.
Rhi (as woman): Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. She will slip the whiskey to someone else and be like…
Rhi (as woman): Do not open that until we finish the job tonight, all right?
Rhi: …and the others are kinda like [reluctantly] all right, all right, all right. She seems to be kind of the one in charge of the crew here. She will walk you over to the dinghy and help you in. I think you’ve still got the blanket, and she’s gonna start rowing you to shore.
Minna: Does she row along the back?
Rhi: Sure.
Minna: I would also like to mark a lantern and use the flint with it to light a little spark as a signal. I am willing to pay stress for a flashback to have set up this signal.
Rhi: Um…
Minna: Just for those two to jump onto the boat.
Rhi: Yeah, I think that’s gonna be a 1 stress flashback.
Minna: Good with me.
Rhi: Yeah, so the two of you see a boat rowing out kind of alongside the barge, and you see the little lantern flash. What are you gonna do?
Kim: I think Blaire’s the one who spots the lantern first, probably, maybe, I don’t know. I’ll just say that.
Rhi: Yeah. I will say that in the meantime the two of you can have filled up another two barrels of electroplasm while Myra’s been doing this. Yeah.
Josie: Okay. Yeah. Let’s just get this done then.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. I think there’s gonna need to be one more roll either from Blaire and Minx to get into the boat with these enormous, heavy barrels or Myra, you’re gonna need to somehow get control of the boat.
Minna: I can, uh…
Rhi: Because this lady is not in on your plan! [laughs]
Minna: Vial of slumber essence and Skirmish.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. You can knock her out. I’m gonna give you controlled on this, because she’s not expecting you to attack her. She thinks you’re some poor, probably strung out on drugs waif who tumbled over the side into the—
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Really?!
Rhi: What’d you get?
Minna: I got a 3.
Rhi: Three. Okay. You can either try again and it’ll be risky or you can withdraw and try a different approach.
Minna: I can do that. That’ll be easier.
Rhi: Okay. I feel like what it is, you pour it on your cloth and you start to reach for her and she turns to look over her shoulder.
Minna: Yeah, she turns to look over her shoulder…
Rhi: Uh-huh?
Minna: …so it’s more risky…
Rhi: And?
Minna: …but I immediately clap the cloth over her mouth and nose.
Rhi: What did you get?
Minna: Six.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] yep! Yeah, so she kind of falls over in the side of the boat, like she’s still in the boat, and she’s just gently napping now.
Minna: Yep.
Rhi: Myra, you can row over to the side of the barge and help your friends load the other two barrels in, and then I think the Gondoliers are kind of in the area and a couple of them—Kay, Kay was at this part.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: Because why not.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Anytime the Gondoliers are involved in a score Kay needs to be there, because Kay is a delight.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. Kay will come over and, well, I don’t know. What is your plan here? Are you stealing the boat? Are you gonna leave this woman somewhere? Do you wanna transfer yourselves and the electroplasm to a gondola?
Minna: We’re gonna transfer to a gondola, I think.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: This woman can wake up in a boat.
Rhi: Yeah. So yeah, Kay will help you all get moved, Kay and a couple other Gondoliers. Yeah, so you all load up the last of the electroplasm and the Gondoliers will head off, and this very nice woman will wake up like an hour later, in this boat, real confused but otherwise unharmed. Yeah, you all are able to, I think with the Gondoliers’ help, make your way back up the rivers—well really just the one river—up the river and the canals over to the warehouse. Yeah. I think when you get there and you start off-loading the stuff Bazso comes in three minutes later with a bunch of Lampblacks who are hauling weapons and they are all just like covered in blood. [laughs]
Josie: Oh geez.
Minna: Hmm…
Rhi: I think he just kinda looks over at all of you, because you Minx, also covered in blood, Myra, covered in river gunk. He kinda looks over at you and is like:
Rhi (as Bazso): Good night?
Josie (as Minx): Could have been worse.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yep, sounds about the same here.
Rhi: And then goes back to directing his people.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So yeah, good job. You stole some stuff from a moving barge.
Josie: We did a thing.
Rhi: You did a thing.
## Downtime [1:14:37]
Rhi: Okay. Let’s get into our downtime scenes. Let’s start… I don’t know. Who wants to go first?
Josie: I’ll go first.
Rhi: Okay! what is Minx gonna be up to?
Josie: Minx is going to see Nyryx, but also, specifically, lilac, just to spend time, because she hasn’t really gotten to talk to Lilac at all, and Nyryx is with her all day, so… [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Right. [laughs] You’d like to get to know this other person that’s kind of involved here.
Josie: Yeah, and I think she’ll bring her own tea or something, something nice.
Rhi: Yeah. I think you show up at Nyryx’s place on a day that she’s got off of work. I think she’s like… Yeah, I’ll lean into making this just really aggressively cute and domestic.
Josie: [squeaks]
Kim: Yay.
Rhi: I think she’s in the middle of making dinner, like she’s prepping stuff for dinner.
Josie: Aww. Can I do the thing where I slip up behind her?
Rhi: Yes. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. She’s like, you know, doing the chopping things… I imagine that she’d let you in and you’d been telling her about your latest misadventures.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, I’m glad that you didn’t get hurt too badly. It sounds like you’re doing a lot of good over there, potentially, and Bazso too.
Josie (as Minx): Both of those are a relief. we’ve been needing a breakthrough, and Bazso was in a bad place.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yeah… Well, I’m still not entirely certain he’s in the clear yet. He seems to find trouble with almost as much enthusiasm as you do.
Josie (as Minx): He’s the one leading one of the bigger gangs in the city. I think I have some doing to go.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [laughs]
Rhi: I think Minx will probably have to bring up the thing about wanting to talk to Lilac. I think she just kinda laughs and goes back to chopping up whatever she’s chopping.
Josie (as Minx): So… since you told me I realized I haven’t talk to Lilac at all.
Rhi: You’re still standing behind her. I think you can feel she tenses up a little bit and then kind of like, shoulders go back down.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Um…
Josie: I think I just kind of hold her waist a little bit.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Uh, I just, you know, wasn’t… I know that you’re not… [inhales] thrilled about it, and I just didn’t wanna, you know, make you uncomfortable.
Josie (as Minx): Dears, it’s fine. I want to understand.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [exhales] Well, um… let me get this boiling. She’s… not the best cook.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: She finishes up with whatever she’s making and gets everything in a pot, wipes her hands off on a towel, and when she turns around to look at you it’s that sense of somebody else in her eyes. She gives you a nervous smile.
Rhi (as Lilac): Uh, hi again… Minx.
Josie (as Minx): Hi Lilac. You know, it’s weird, usually I’m good at first impressions.
Rhi (as Lilac): Heh.
Josie (as Minx): But I suppose I’m just really here to talk with you?
Rhi (as Lilac): Oh. Um, yeah… uh. Um… what? I mean, what would you wanna talk about?
Josie (as Minx): What do you enjoy? What do you do with your time?
Rhi (as Lilac): There’s not a way to say this that doesn’t sound creepy. I just kinda, you know, watch what Nyryx does a lot of the time except for when she’s working or she’s with you and she kinda has to send me away. I like reading. I’ve been learning how to read.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, that’s good.
Rhi (as Lilac): Nyryx has some books. I like the poetry that she has. It’s pretty. I don’t always understand it, but it’s pretty.
Josie (as Minx): Well, if you are ever in need of books I have a few and have tried to write some myself…
Rhi (as Lilac): [small gasp]
Josie (as Minx): …although it’s of specific subject matter.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Lilac): Oh! What do you—Ohh… Oh. Um…
Josie (as Minx): Just… Not what you’re thinking. Let’s call it fantastical fiction.
Rhi (as Lilac): Oh… Huh.
Josie (as Minx): Very much more about the characters. Anyway.
Rhi (as Lilac): I mean, yeah, I’d like to read that. That’d be fun.
Josie (as Minx): Do you, like, have scheduled time out, or…?
Rhi (as Lilac): Not really. It’s just kinda, you know, sometimes Nyryx wants to take a nap but still get stuff done? So then I can take over and she can kinda get a mental break and…
Josie (as Minx): Well, that’s a nice upside for the both of you.
Rhi (as Lilac): Mm-hmm, and you know, sometimes it’s just… we just sort of work stuff out.
Josie (as Minx): Right.
Rhi (as Lilac): I don’t mind her being in charge most of the time. I mean, it is her body. I’m just kind of a… guest? Yeah, a guest. I’m visiting.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. Well, you’re definitely welcome around me as well.
Rhi (as Lilac): Thanks!
Rhi: I think she moves towards you and stops.
Rhi (as Lilac): Um… Is it okay if I give you a hug?
Josie (as Minx): Yes of course!
[laughter]
Rhi: Aww, so yeah, she’ll give you a hug. I think when she steps back it’s Nyryx again and she is a little teary-eyed.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: She’s gonna just bounce up on her toes and give you a kiss.
Josie: Yay. I wipe her tear a little bit.
Rhi: Aww.
Josie: The one-finger way.
Rhi: They’re so cute!
Josie: They’re super cute!
Rhi: Ugh! I love it. All right, well, we’ll leave that very cute scene and let’s jump over to Blaire I think. What is Blaire up to? Yeah.
Kim: So, heh, Blaire’s not in a great place. She was not on her game today, so I think the first thing that we see is that as soon as the crew gets back to The Nest she just storms off to her room and slams her door.
Josie: Oh no…
Kim: If this were in modern times you’d probably be hearing some very muffled Three Days Grace blasting from the door.
[laughter]
Kim: Blaire’s gonna have a good cry, and once that’s done she is going to just throw herself into her research on recovering ghosts from spirit trafficked drugs. She just spends a couple of hours by moonlight. If this were filmed as a time lapse there are some very sharp cuts of Hex napping in very different places, stretching.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: You know, completely sprawled out or curled up in a corner, whatever.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: So yeah, Blaire’s just leafing through papers and playing with vials and liquids, and right when the first shards of the morning sun are peering through her bedroom window we get a shot of her face and she’s obviously sleep-deprived but there is a sense of wonder and accomplishment on her face as if she had just figured out something amazing.
Rhi: I’m picturing that she’s got just notes spread out all over but there’s one piece of paper in the center that she’s got some complex arcane sigils on that lead down to some alchemical formula at the bottom.
Kim: Yeah. After that I think she just… she doesn’t even make it to bed, she just kinda collapses on the floor. Hex is just gonna lie down there right next to her.
Rhi: Aww. Good cuddle buddy. All right, so let’s jump over to Myra. What is Myra doing at this point?
Minna: I think we’ve got another kitchen scene, honestly.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Minna: I think she’s clearing up the dinner dishes and chatting with Minx.
Minna (as Myra): You know, the funniest thing happened when I was in the water.
Josie (as Minx): Oh?
Minna (as Myra): I swear Clave locked eyes with me and helped me back onto the barge? That can’t be true though.
Josie (as Minx): Well… it was a good catch, because um… well, you know how I was working on getting those informants up and running so we can handle Salia?
Minna (as Myra): Minx, you didn’t! Clave?!
Josie (as Minx): You’re right. I didn’t. She did.
Minna (as Myra): You can’t trust her.
Josie (as Minx): There’s an arm’s length plus a blade’s length that we are handling this with.
Rhi: [chuckles]
Minna (as Myra): Clave is only out there for her own benefit.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps that is true, and she saw what happened to the other one who attacked us.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, she wouldn’t like that about Ojal, would she? Oh…
Josie (as Minx): No. Make no mistake, I am not saying we are allies or that this is anything more than a short-term business relationship, but after that I believe her when she says she doesn’t want to work for Salia anymore.
Minna (as Myra): Now that you’ve said it like that, wow, I kinda believe it. I don’t know why she would come to us, but… I can see why she didn’t come to me.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well, I suppose it’s just because we’ve made in-roads on the Circle, although frankly if she just wanted to disappear I’m sure some other gang could make it happen, but Salia is very skilled herself I suppose.
Minna (as Myra): yeah, and it’s not easy to get away from her. Hell, I’m testament to that.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I’m glad you did.
Minna (as Myra): I’m glad I did too, frankly.
Josie: I think this is hug time?
Rhi: Aww.
Josie: Sister hug.
Rhi: Yay~
Minna (as Myra): Oh. It’s all right, Minx. I’m glad you told me. I’m glad that we have a source on Salia. This is gonna be strange, but as long as you’re cool handling it.
Josie (as Minx): I am fine handling it for now. I’m still kind of getting to know the woman, so we’ll see where that goes.
Rhi: I think we fade in on the Magpies back up in the Docks. Not too much time has passed, I would say maybe a week or so, and the organizers here haven’t made their big push to push out the gangs and the Bluecoats and everyone, but even so it feels different. You can kinda see people, like, people are walking around together and are… you can sort of tell where people are planning out patrols, a lot of buildings in this area that have been damaged are starting to be repaired where before people just kinda left them because things just kept getting broken over and over again.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I think that as you all are making your way down a street you pass by an alley where you can see a few people, I think Fiona, the lead organizer, is among them, and they are kind of surreptitiously feeding electroplasm out of a barrel into a generator that they have there. Fiona looks up and catches your eyes and just gives you a little two-finger salute and then goes back to work.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: So yeah, things are progressing there, and we’ll see how that plays out in the future.

Rhi: Blaire is the angsty teenage daughter to Minx and Myra’s adopted moms.
Josie: [laughs] Yeah.
Kim: I’m surprised it took this long for y’all to figure it out.
Rhi: No, no, I think we’ve known it for a while. I mean, you literally claimed that they were your moms at one point.
Minna: [squeaks laughing]
Kim: Oh, that’s right!
Rhi: In a score.
Minna: That was beautiful."
"Season 3, Episode 13: Doskvol Interstitials Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter)
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us and thank you for your ongoing support. We’ve had great reviews, new patrons, kind messages and, incredibly, more than 1,000 followers on Twitter. It’s all a great way to help new fans find the show and your support always brightens our days.
This week’s episode is a very different one and it’s one that I’ve been wanting to do for a while. Game designer Matthew Balousek has published Doskvol Interstitials, a zine of solo microgames and prompts all inspired by Blades in the Dark, and in this episode we used those games as the basis for a series of small vignettes featuring The Magpies and many of their friends in the city and beyond. It was a lot of fun and I hope that you all enjoy these little glimpses into the lives of the characters beyond the drama and tension of a score. There’s a link to Matthew’s website in the show notes if you would like to pick up a copy of Doskvol Interstitials for yourself.
## [00.01.21] Content warning: Discussion of COVID-19. To skip, go to next timestamp.
In place of a featured charity this episode, I want to quickly highlight some opportunities for donating or supporting each other during this pandemic. First, as you are no doubt aware, medical professionals are rapidly running out of personal protective equipment, PPE. At the same time, many people are raising funds to purchase and donate this much-needed equipment to local hospitals. In Chicago, you can donate funds at the site Get Me PPE Chicago, which is linked in the show notes. To look for places to help in your area, google your city, state or local hospital plus ‘PPE donations’.
Second, lots of artists and small business are really struggling right now. If you are financially able, try to purchase books, games or gift certificates from local places and independent creatives. In particular, it can be really helpful to buy gift cards. The business will get much-needed cash to stay afloat now, and future you can get something fun.
Third, please continue to reach out to your elected officials. We must demand protection and support for everyone right now, but especially medical professionals, the essential workers who are putting themselves at risk so that we as a society can still get food and utilities and garbage pick-ups, and the millions of people who have suddenly found themselves out of work.
Finally, do what you can to take care of yourself. Stay informed, but don’t drown in news and data. Don’t pressure yourself to use your time stuck inside your home productively, if that’s your situation. Everyone’s sense of normal has been completely uprooted and we all need extra care now. We are living in very scary, very chaotic times, and it’s causing anxiety, fear and stress around the globe. But what I’m holding onto, what is giving me some hope right now, are all the stories of people taking care of each other. Scientists and authors and artists hosting online lessons for kids who are suddenly homebound. People picking up groceries for neighbors who can’t safely go outside. Restaurants who are donating meals to people in need. There are more moments of kindness than I can list here.
It’s important to remember those things. It’s important to remember that yes, there is greed and cruelty, but most people are reaching out to each other with kindness and support and love. It’s so many of us as humans saying, “We might be isolated but we’re not alone.”
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##[00.04.25] End of content warning.
Rhi: We open up high above Duskwall, the lights glimmering in the eternal darkness, clouds shifting overhead. We zoom down into the city through the crowded streets, past people on their way to work, to home, and we find Nessa Ericks as she makes her way down a Charhollow street, her arms laden with packages and bags. It would have been easier to take a carriage home, but somehow that’s the expense she couldn’t justify today. She fends off a supposedly helpful passer-by who’s just as likely to run off with her packages as carry them to her door. At least there’s not stairs to climb to reach her apartment. She gets the front door open and half-stumbles inside.
Rhi (as Voice): Nessa? Is that you behind all that stuff?
Rhi: The floorboards creak under her mother’s wheelchair as she rolls over. But that’s about the only sound it makes. Her old chair was rusted and busted and clattered something terrible. The first big payout Nessa got, she bought her mother a new one. It’s one of the finest things the family owns.
Rhi (as Nessa): Yeah, Ma, it is.
Rhi: Nessa drops the packages on the table and leans down to hug her mother hello.
Rhi (as Nessa): Sold another painting to The Magpies, and I saved most of it, but I was coming back through Nightmarket and I thought I’d pick up a few treats.
Rhi (as Ma): [laughs] More than a few!
Rhi: Nessa smiles and picks up a wrapped package.
Rhi (as Nessa): Here. A lot of it’s for the boys, but this is for you.
Rhi: Her mother makes all the required noises about not needing anything, Nessa didn’t have to, all while unwrapping the brown paper. Inside is a small, soft quilt, just the right size to drape over a lap without catching in wheels. Their apartment can get awful drafty, and even with the money she makes from selling forgeries to Minx, it’s not enough to pay for a new place. But she can still buy things that’ll make the place they have a little nicer.
Rhi (as Ma): Thank you, Ness.
Rhi: Her mother runs her hand over the quilt and smiles.
Rhi (as Ma): It’s lovely.
##Music plays [00.06.41]
Rhi: We see Blaire with an armful of spirit jars that she’s taken out of her bag and I think that she has, uh, the place that she’s gone to this time is near an old watchtower out in the Deathlands outside the city. It’s half-crumbled, probably used to be along some trade road. And I think as you’re, like, probably getting ready to open up these jars you hear some, like, clattering inside the tower.
Kim: I— well, let me ask this. What is the nature of the clattering? Does it sound like it could be a human, or does it sound like it could be a creature? I know that’s kind of a specific question, but…
Rhi: It’s hard to tell. It sounds like some rocks falling, like something kicked them over.
Kim: Mm.
Rhi: So, it could be anything.
Kim: Okay. In that case, I think Blaire is just going to, like, whirl around, and one of her hands is going to immediately fly to one of her lightning hooks.
Rhi: So, I think there’s some more clattering, and then you hear, like, a thud and an “Oof!” And you see a surprisingly familiar figure stride out of the tower holding a bunch of what look like just rocks in his arms. Taller man, light skin, dark hair that’s kinda starting to get touched with grey. He’s got a lot of kind of runic tattoos up both arms. And he comes out and, like, stops and does a double-take and is like:
Rhi (as Man): Blaire? Right? Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): Dowler?
Rhi (as Dowler): Yeah. Damn. It’s been a while.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah!
Rhi (as Dowler): Don’t get up to Barrowcleft much these days, I take it?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… no, no I’m uh… I’m running with a crew now.
Rhi (as Dowler): Oh.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Uh, hi!
Rhi (as Dowler): Hi. Er…
Rhi: He kinda looks down and notes the jars and is like:
Rhi (as Dowler): Ah. Still doing that?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, yes. Yes. No, I’ve always been doing this, Dowler, you know me.
Rhi (as Dowler): Well, uh, I would be grateful if you would wait until I get out of here with…
Rhi: He kinda looks down at the rocks and is like:
Rhi (as Dowler): Ancient Deathlands crystals.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m sorry, what?
Rhi (as Dowler): I’ll polish these up some and put some labels on them. People will pay a decent amount of coin.
Kim (as Blaire): Wait, can I see?
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, he’s like:
Rhi (as Dowler): They’re not really anything special, Blaire, they’re just—
Kim (as Blaire): No, but I wanna see!
Rhi (as Dowler): Okay…
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know, I’ve never seen these before!
Rhi: He holds one out to you. They are literally just, like, rocks he’s picked up. [laughs]
Kim: [laughs] I think Blaire’s gonna clock that immediately. She’s gonna, like, glance a few times between the rocks and Dowler and she’s gonna be like:
Kim (as Blaire): These are just rocks.
Rhi (as Dowler): They are ancient Deathlands crystals that hold mystical powers.
Kim (as Blaire): These are not crystals. I own a few crystals. These are not crystals. You’re scamming people.
Rhi (as Dowler): Gotta earn your coin, right?
Rhi: He starts putting them into his bag.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, yeah, I can’t blame you for that. But also, these are, like… are you, like, selling these telling people that they’re, like, magic? Or…
Rhi (as Dowler): I mean… yes?
Kim (as Blaire): But that’s… but they’re not. They’re rocks.
Rhi (as Dowler): Correct.
Kim (as Blaire): People are gonna know if they’re not magic.
Rhi (as Dowler): Most won’t. I sell you the legit stuff because you know.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm… listen, I—[sighs] I’m just trying to watch out for your skin. What if you accidentally try to sell this to someone who knows their shit, you know?
Rhi (as Dowler): Well then, they won’t buy them, will they?
Kim (as Blaire): Or they’ll hurt you, or try to kill you or… you know, tell—
Rhi (as Dowler): Eh, people have tried to kill me before. I usually get better.
Kim (as Blaire): Dowler!
Rhi (as Dowler): [amused] Oh, like you’re one to talk, Miss Wandering Into The Deathlands Alone With Five Jars Full Of Ghosts!
Kim (as Blaire): I do this all the time!
Rhi (as Dowler): And I do this all the time!
Rhi: He’s, like, grinning at you as he says this. He’s just like:
Rhi (as Dowler): I appreciate the concern, Blaire, but I can handle myself and I trust that you can handle yourself too.
Kim (as Blaire): [long sigh]
Rhi (as Dowler): And you should stop by more often.
Kim (as Blaire): You should stop by more often.
Rhi (as Dowler): I don’t know where to stop by.
Kim (as Blaire): Hound’s Paw. I’m there all the time.
Rhi (as Dowler): Oh. Alright. Is that over in Nightmarket?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi (as Dowler): If I happen to be in that part of the city, I’ll look you up.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks. I missed you.
Rhi (as Dowler): [laughs] Well, my stall hasn’t moved, still over in the Barrowcleft Market. And I do have some legit things you could buy.
Kim (as Blaire): I know, it’s just that… for the past couple of months I haven’t had any money.
Rhi (as Dowler): I thought you were running with a group of thieves?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, and they take care of me, like, they feed me and stuff, but I didn’t have— we don’t really keep any money.
Rhi (as Dowler): So, you’re not very good thieves, then.
Kim (as Blaire): No, we’re really not.
Rhi (as Dowler): I guess if you’re, uh… good with that?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, yeah. They feed me, so it’s fine.
Rhi (as Dowler): Well, I will leave you to your ghosts. Seriously, give me like, count to 500 so I can get good clearance—
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, no, no, I would never. I would never, Dowler. You’re too good to be possessed, I would never.
Rhi (as Dowler): I appreciate it.
Rhi: I think he kinda like, you know, starts to walk past and pats you on the shoulder.
Rhi (as Dowler): See you around, kid.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm… mm… can I have a hug? I missed you.
Rhi (as Dowler): [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, he’ll hold out an arm.
Kim: Yay. Blaire hugs him.
Rhi: Yep. It’s kind of just a one-armed, like, pat-pat hug from him.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: I think he does the little, like, two-finger salute thing and then strolls off.
Kim: Yeah, I think Blaire is just gonna watch him leave and make sure that he is far away enough before she opens the jars. That’s really it.
Rhi: Okay.
##Music plays [00.12.38]
Josie: With Minx, I think she’s on her way back from getting groceries or something. She has a basket over her arm when suddenly she catches sight of something across the street and says:
Josie (as Minx): No way!
Josie: And across the street is a tiny little bookstore wedged between two tenements called The Morning Crow. And she hurries across the street, and has to dodge a carriage, and into the little shop, but she immediately rifles through what is essentially the magazine stand. Like, it’s a normal bookstore, but the magazine stand in front she’s rifling through until she finds the latest issue of a line that she doesn’t read anymore. And I think at that point we get a flashback of tiny baby Minx and tiny Bazso and Nyryx getting bodily dragged into the bookstore by tiny Minx, like:
Josie (as Minx): Come on! The new issue is out!
Rhi: Aww!
Josie: And she’s picking up one of her first fashion magazines. And I think she’s scrounged together enough coin to buy one, but after much, much cajoling to an annoyed Bazso and politely bemused Nyryx, she goes to pay for it and while the shopkeeper is distracted making change they slip a few more into their clothes.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: And then they leave with magazines for all of them.
Rhi: And so, does Minx buy the one here today?
Josie: Yes.
##Music plays [00.14.18]
Rhi: Tycheros isn’t bad, exactly. People here are kinder than in Duskwall. Even if they look all manner of strange. They’re more willing to help each other out without trying to take advantage. The scavengers were like that too, though that was more for survival than anything. The Culhanes have been nothing but generous to him. Got him a job, set him up in a little apartment not far from their hotel. The tonics here are better quality than what he could get in Duskwall, too. They keep him feeling more stable. He’s managed to grow a decent beard for the first time. It’s nice. It’s peaceful. It’s safe. Nevan Rigney is damn near bored out of his mind.
He hasn’t stolen anything in months, a fact than Caelan would be overjoyed to hear. “Itchy fingers,” their mom always said. Itchy fingers that made him a decent amount of coin, and that landed him in prison. He doesn’t want to take advantage of these people and their kindness, so he’s keeping his fingers to himself. He tried to study alchemy a bit, but the math didn’t stick. Putting things together and getting something nice at the end did though, so he’s been trying his hand at cooking. Caelan did most of it when he was home, and there was a dish he used to make with mushrooms and goat butter and crab meat that was always Nevan’s favorite.
Nevan gives the pan a shake to toss the mushrooms, filling the air with a delicious scent. He grabs one out of the pan with his fingers, curses when he burns himself, and pops it into his mouth. It tastes close. But not quite right. Maybe a dash more pepper will do the trick.
##Music plays [00.16.05]
Minna: Myra has been spending a lot of time outside of The Nest lately. Helping out at the clinic and checking in at The Docks. Catching up with contacts she hasn’t been able to speak to as much. She comes back from drinking some very strange tea and telling Amancio about the latest antics, looks at the clock and sighs. She was up late last night, and Myra rarely is able to sleep past local dawn, even if the brief hazy appearance of the sun isn’t visible through her window. She’s exhausted.
For a few minutes, she pokes around the common areas, tidying little things away. She finds a scarf draped across the back of a chair and goes to put it around Kevin’s neck. He’s currently standing next to bathroom window, which has a crack that lets in a chilly draft. She makes a note that they still have to fix that crack. She contemplates cleaning the bathroom, which probably needs it…
Minna (as Myra): [yawns]
Minna: And a big yawn interrupts. There’s noting to do that can’t wait, and she’s been pushing herself hard for weeks. She pauses in the doorway to her bedroom. The bed looks very inviting.
Minna (as Myra): [sighs] Okay. Fine.
Minna: And it’s nap time.
## Music plays [00.17.16]
Rhi: So, we find Blaire at Scurlock Manor in the still fairly dusty sitting room. The only pieces of furniture that have been recently cleaned are the ones in immediate use, which means it’s a pair of armchairs and the small table between them. Sitting on the table is a beautifully polished antique silver tea service and Blaire has one cup of tea. There is a second cup of tea sitting untouched beside the occupant of the other armchair, which is one Lord Scurlock, who I think is probably listening to Blaire with an expression somewhere between bemusement and vaguely entertained.
Kim (as Blaire): So, I’ve been working really hard in the past couple of months just trying to figure this out, trying to just pull the ghosts out of what they’re trying to be forced to become, and I— I don’t know, I’ve just kind of hit a roadblock and I… I mean, I kind of know you. Do you have— you’ve probably looked into stuff like this, right? You have some idea of how to go about this?
Rhi: I think he kind of studies you for a long moment and leans back into his chair and:
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): I can honestly say, no. I haven’t. You’re quite ambitious. Possibly foolishly so. But certainly don’t lack for innovation, I suppose.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, you’re ambitious too. That’s why I asked.
Rhi: He smirks faintly.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): You’re attempting to reconstitute ghosts that have been processed into various alchemicals.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah…
Rhi: He sort of— it seems like initially it looks like he’s gonna be kind of dismissive and then he actually sorta like frowns and seems to be thinking about it.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): I am… I am skeptical that you would be able to return a spirit to the state it was prior to processing. Spirits are fragile things. More fragile, I think, than most realize. Particularly when they don’t have something to inhabit. That’s why they seek bodies. It is possible that you could create a sort of gestalt entity, taking the fragmentary remains of multiple spirits and combining them into a single unit and putting that spirit into some sort of corporeal form.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s not what I’m trying to do. I’m trying to save the individual, not create something new.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Well. I am not certain if that is within anyone’s means.
Kim (as Blaire): Lord Scurlock, with all due respect, please, you have to know something about this.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): As I said, it is not something that I have given much consideration to. I have had greater concerns than the spirit trafficking and drug trade in the city.
Kim (as Blaire): What greater concerns?
Rhi: He just sort of stares at you.
Kim: Blaire stares back.
Rhi: [laughs] There’s a long pause. How— does Blaire just not break on this one?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, so I think it’s like— it’s a long and uncomfortable silence as, like, they’re both just… they’re both just sitting there waiting for the other to break. [laughs] And neither of them does. So, I think eventually Scurlock, again, does that very faint smirk and says:
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Things that I have no inclination to discuss with you at present.
Kim (as Blaire): Wh… why not? I thought we were friends.
Rhi: He gives Blaire, like, a frankly baffled look and says:
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): What gave you that idea?
Kim: I think Blaire’s just gonna be, like, quiet, for just a minute, and then she’s gonna look at him and say:
Kim (as Blaire): Do you remember when we met, when I was at Charterhall?
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Vaguely.
Kim (as Blaire): Everybody else was scared of you, but I wasn’t. And this is the second time I’ve been to your manor. I know you don’t let a lot of people here.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): You’re very persistent. Friendship is a strong word.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna look a little defeated.
Rhi: Aww.
Kim: And she’s gonna say:
Kim (as Blaire): So… what would you call us? If not friends?
Rhi: I think, again, he just sort of gives Blaire a long look and finally says:
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): You are an intriguing and persistent acquaintance with a great many ambitious ideas.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Okay, I… [sighs] I can work with acquaintance for now.
Rhi: I think he has the decency to wait until Blaire looks away before he rolls his eyes. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah, yeah.
Rhi: I think after sort of a long, awkward silence he says:
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): I am not certain that your research will bear any results, but I am intrigued to see where you go with it. If you return in a week or so, Oskar will give you some tomes that may be of interest.
Kim (as Blaire): You mean it? Really?
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you so much. I knew you had something about this.
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): It is not specifically about this particular task, but it does relate to the properties of spirits. Some older research that is more difficult to find these days.
Kim (as Blaire): No, but that’s exactly what I need. Thank you!
Rhi: He just shakes his head, is like:
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): You’re welcome. Don’t damage them, I need them returned.
Kim (as Blaire): I would— I would never dream of it. No, no, no, no, no.
Rhi: I think somewhere a clock chimes in the house and Scurlock is very abruptly on his feet and is like:
Rhi (as Lord Scurlock): If you’ll excuse me, Miss Culhane, I have another appointment to attend to.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh… okay. Um… it was nice seeing you!
Rhi: He just gives you sort of a curt nod and exits. And then, like, the door swings shut and then instantly it swings back open and Oskar is standing there. He’s like:
Rhi (as Oskar): Hello, Miss Culhane. Once you’ve finished your tea, I can escort you out.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you know if I’ll see your uncle again in a week?
Rhi (as Oskar): Uh, I don’t know, he doesn’t tell me his schedule.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm. Okay. Thank you in advance for the books, I really, really appreciate it.
Rhi: He just sorta looks at you blankly. He doesn’t know what you’re talking about. [laughs]
Kim: No, not yet.
Rhi: Yeah. Just like:
Rhi (as Oskar): Uh… very well. Um, I’m sure that my uncle will fill me in on the details.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Um, thank you once again for having me in your lovely home.
Rhi: [laughs] This home is, like, the most crumbling, decrepit, gothic-ass Victorian manor.
Kim: And it’s lovely!
Rhi: [laughs] So, he just says:
Rhi (as Oskar): Thank you for stopping by.
Rhi: And he will walk you out to the front door.
##Music plays [00.24.30]
Rhi: We see Seeks seated on a low, crumbling wall beside a toppled tower, gently scratching a goat on the head. It’s a calm, peaceful evening. The breeze is blowing gently through her hair, rustling her clothes, and as she is scratching the goat’s head it looks up at her with its many starry eyes and asks:
Rhi (as Goat): [otherworldly voice] What if I don’t like it later?
Waffles: Seeks shrugs.
Waffles (as Seeks): Well, if you don’t like it later, I mean, there’s lots of names you might not like, and you can always change it.
Rhi: A second goat walks along the dilapidated, mossy tower, climbing along the crumbled bricks as goats are wont to do, and it looks back at Seeks and asks:
Rhi (as Goat): Well, what names don’t you like?
Waffles (as Seeks): Hmm…
Waffles: Seeks scrunches the grass beneath her toes and does a little wiggle with her nose and goes:
Waffles (as Seeks): Hmm… Chowder. And Spidersnot and, um, Archibald. Archibald is terrible name.
Rhi: A third goat goes tumbling gently through the warm summer air and blinking its many eyes down at Seeks:
Rhi (as Goat): Do you think Summer is a good name?
Waffles (as Seeks): I think it’s a lovely name.
Rhi: The goat continues drifting on, nodding thoughtfully as it continues. And from behind a tree, a tall oak tree with bright green leaves drifting gently in the summer sunlight, a small figure emerges and approaches Seeks.
Waffles: Summer is a fourteen-year-old-sized individual wearing patchwork shepherd clothes, a tiny newsboy cap, and they have many shifting, shapeless, starry tentacles for hair and a variable number of eyes, depending on their particular mood at any second, and a wide smile filled with sharp teeth.
Rhi (as Summer): Well, what if I don’t like me later?
Waffles (as Seeks): Well, you can change that, too.
Waffles: And Seeks will embrace them in a hug.
Rhi: Summer will nod at that and hug Seeks back. And when Seeks opens her eyes, she is sitting in one of the many catacombs underneath Duskwall, her hand dangling into a deep, dark pool, the last ripples of the pool’s occupant fading away.
Waffles (as Seeks): Good night, sweet bean. I’ll see you tomorrow.
##Music plays [00.27.20]
Josie: So, in the wake of even more strife in Ink Row, I think there’s a— I don’t know how to describe it, but like a volunteer soup kitchen set up at the boundary of the district, run by the Weeping Lady. And Minx has been spending her shifts there recently. So, she’s kind of in her serving outfit and her hair kind of done back with a handkerchief, and she’s obviously pretty down, because no one’s happy to have to come here and it’s obviously still in a bad way, but she’s, like, tapping her foot a little bit.
Rhi: Yeah. I think from sort of the conversations that you’re hearing, there’s been a lot of upheaval in the Ink Row neighborhood. The process of establishing the boundaries of this community, running it for themselves, kicking out the gangs, the Bluecoats, is not a smooth one. But most people in the neighborhood are sort of united, moving in the same direction. So, it’s hard work but most people are supporting it. And I’m imagining that this is not necessarily in a formal, like, closed-off building. I’m thinking that it’s maybe just kind of like, you know, on the street. They have some tables set up off kind of an empty lot.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: So Minx, while you’re filling up bowls of probably some kind of kelp and mushroom soup, you see across the street a familiar figure. Bazso Baz is walking past with a pair of his guards and he glances over, does a very visible double-take and then, like, looks to his guards and holds up a hand indicating for them to stop. And he strolls across the street, hands shoved in his pockets, and when he’s within speaking distance is just like:
Rhi (as Bazso): Have you been possessed?
Josie: Minx startles out of whatever she’s doing and turns round to see him and says:
Josie (as Minx): What? No. What? I mean, why would you ask that?
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, the Ellie that I grew up with would not be caught dead wearing…
Rhi: And he kind of gestures at what I imagine is like, dressed-down plus the handkerchief plus an apron, like…
Josie: [laughs] Minx sort of coughs to herself and puts back on her Minx voice, which I imagine is very weird for the other people in the kitchen around her. The quote-unquote ‘kitchen’.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps not, but I think I make it work, dear. I try to keep them clean.
Rhi (as Bazso): What are you doing?
Josie (as Minx): I’m helping.
Rhi: And he just kinda like, looks around the space and is like:
Rhi (as Bazso): This isn’t like you.
Josie (as Minx): Heh, well I suppose not, but, I mean, people need help. And I wasn’t helping. And that needed to change, I think.
Rhi: He just kind of stares at you, and it’s that look of, like, you’re speaking a language that he understands, and he understands the individual words you’re saying, but put together in that order just doesn’t make sense to him.
Josie: [laughs] Right.
Rhi: He’s just like:
Rhi (as Bazso): What are you… I mean, what are you getting out of this? What’s the angle?
Josie: I think at that point she kind of looks to her coworkers then just sort of nods like she’s gonna step away for a second.
Rhi: A couple of the other coworkers are like, yeah, clearly you’ve got some stuff to deal with. One of them looks disappointed because he was absorbing some serious gossip here. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] Aww.
Rhi: He’s just like, “Wait, no, don’t walk out of earshot!” [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Well, there’s no… there’s no angle, Bazso. This is… I’m off-duty, as it were. I did have an angle when I finally got to go into the Centuralia Club.
Rhi (as Bazso): Huh.
Josie (as Minx): But it wasn’t as good as I was hoping.
Rhi (as Bazso): Eh, those things usually aren’t.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah.
Rhi (as Bazso): And so now you do this.
Josie (as Minx): In short, yes. But, I mean, all three of us kind of changed tracks as to what we were doing after…
Josie: She gestures to the rubble of Ink Row.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Bazso): I mean, there’s changed tracks and then there’s…
Josie (as Minx): Don’t you worry, Bazso. I’m stull doing everything the magnificent Ellie you know has been doing. Just, a bit more fruitful efforts.
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, I hope not everything Ellie did.
Rhi: Pointed look.
Josie: She kind of blanches at that and puts her gesturing arm down.
Josie (as Minx): Well… yes. Not that.
Rhi (as Bazso): [laughs] Well, I guess I shouldn’t keep you.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, you are free to hang around and speak to me, it doesn’t require all of my attention.
Rhi (as Bazso): I’ve got places to be. People to meet with.
Josie (as Minx): As you say, dear. I’ll get back to it then. It was good to see you.
Rhi: I think he hesitates for a second and then is like.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah. Yeah, it was good seeing ya.
Rhi: Like it’s just occurred to him that it was nice to talk to you again. And I think he kinda gives you a nod and then will walk back to his guards and they continue on their way. And I think right before they turn the corner he kinda glances back and like, looks at you again, still a little confused, and just sorta shakes his head and then they walk out of sight.
Josie: And Minx returns to her coworkers, slipping back into Ellie voice.
Rhi: There’s definitely a— Minx fields a few questions about like, wait, so how do you know the leader of The Lampblacks? [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: People are very curious. But if she doesn’t wanna talk about it, they don’t pry.
Josie: I… there’s no doubt gonna be the suggestion of lovers thrown out at some point.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: And she will speak up to quash that.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: Firmly. [laughs]
Rhi: No.
Josie: No!
Rhi: I think actually— I haven’t really— it hasn’t come up, but I think Bazso’s gay. I don’t think Bazso has an interest in women at all.
Josie: Aw, yay. Well that rounds out, because we have gay Bazso, lesbian Minx and bi Nyryx.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yay!
Rhi: By their power combined, they are…
Josie: We are Captain Queer!
Rhi: [bursts out laughing]
##Music plays [00.33.56]
Rhi: Myra, I think that kind of during this calm stretch you stop by The Hound’s Paw to pick up your messages, as you do, and among these messages is a note in a very familiar hand inviting you to meet at a particular day and time at, ‘the usual place in the library’, is what it says.
Minna: Oh. She takes the note and, like, kind of holds it for a second, then is like:
Minna (as Myra): Okay. Let’s do this.
Rhi: So, at the appointed day and time you head up to Doskvol Academy and the library, over to the little private study rom that you and Jeren would always hang out in when he was a student here and you were pretending to be.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: And he is sitting there, not wearing his blue coat. Just wearing sort of a—
Minna: Baby! [laughs]
Rhi: A plain jacket. When you come in, I think it’s one of those things where— I’m picturing just a door with, like, a glass window in the top half. And you can see that he’s, like, bouncing his leg and drumming his fingers on the table. He’s clearly very nervous.
Minna: [whines] I think Myra just, like, quietly opens the door and come in and settles down in the usual seat. Kind of pretending this is normal.
Rhi: Yeah. I think as soon as the door opens Jeren looks up and is kinda like:
Rhi (as Jeren): Uh… hi.
Minna (as Myra): Hi.
Rhi (as Jeren): Thanks for, uh, coming.
Minna (as Myra): I was happy to see the note. How are you doing?
Rhi (as Jeren): Better. Uh… been seeing a physicker, it’s kinda helping with some of the recovery. Leg still bothers me sometimes, but…
Rhi: He just shrugs.
Minna (as Myra): That’s good.
Rhi (as Jeren): They’re, uh, moving me to a station in Brightstone, so…
Minna (as Myra): That’ll be pretty safe.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. I think that was the… that was the thinking. I’m pretty sure my father put some pressure on some people.
Minna (as Myra): He would.
Rhi (as Jeren): How do you think I got admitted here in the first place?
Minna (as Myra): Oh, don’t— if you hadn’t had a brain, they wouldn’t’ve let you in.
Rhi (as Jeren): I thought you were supposed to be the cynic, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): No. No, listen to me. Your father isn’t high enough up to pressure the dean of Doskvol Academy. That was what you were for, remember?
Rhi (as Jeren): Heh. [sighs] Alright, I guess that’s true.
Rhi: He kinda looks down for a second, is just, uh, he does that thing where he opens his mouth like he’s gonna start to talk a couple times, but nothing comes out. And then finally, he just goes:
Rhi (as Jeren): You’re never gonna stop doing this stuff, are you?
Minna (as Myra): No, I can’t foresee a world where that’s possible.
Rhi (as Jeren): You know we’re probably never gonna agree on most of this?
Minna (as Myra): I do know that. It didn’t matter for years what either of us thought about politics beyond a good debate, but… it matters to me now. At least enough that I need to be able to be clear about what I feel.
Rhi (as Jeren): I don’t think you ever said what happened. Like, when it changed. You just… stuff that you’d ignored or been fine with, all of a sudden you couldn’t stand.
Minna (as Myra): I met a woman and it changed everything. At first it was just jobs, and then we started building this gang, and then I had this family and they were all starting to make me see things that I’d had my eyes closed to for so many years because it was all about surviving. But then suddenly, it was more than survival. I could do something about it. Wouldn’t you? I mean, I don’t mean to phrase it that way. Just, there’s so much bad that I’ve seen. It is so freeing to feel that I can do something about it, anything about it.
Rhi: He frowns thoughtfully.
Rhi (as Jeren): I still… the way you do things is dangerous. Not just for you and your friends, but everybody around you.
Minna (as Myra): I know that. It’s— yeah, it’s become really clear that that’s true and that anybody who associates with us needs to understand that.
Rhi (as Jeren): [sighs]
Minna (as Myra): We’ve just gotten too big for them to ignore us, or the people around us.
Rhi (as Jeren): So, I guess it’s… you know where you stand and you’re not moving.
Minna (as Myra): I’m not moving back.
Rhi (as Jeren): So, I just have to decide if it’s worth the risk then, huh?
Minna (as Myra): Jeren, everybody grows as they get older. If we’re growing irreparably apart and this isn’t something you can do anymore, it’s fair and valid of you to choose to stop being friends with me.
Rhi: He makes a pained face at that and is like:
Rhi (as Jeren): I don’t— I’ve missed you. You’re pretty much my oldest friend.
Minna (as Myra): I’ve missed you too. You’re also my oldest friend.
Rhi (as Jeren): I just… it’s hard, knowing that even setting this up was taking a risk. But I think… I think it’s a risk I’m willing to take for now.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. I can live with that.
Rhi (as Jeren): If I get kidnapped again…
Minna (as Myra): [dry laugh] You get kidnapped again and… I don’t even know what to say about that beyond that I will try and get you out again.
Rhi (as Jeren): I know. I, uh, I think that, um, restaurant we would go to sometimes on the bridge? I think that’s still open. If you wanted to maybe grab lunch.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I’d love that. Um, yeah, leave a note when’s a good time and—
Rhi (as Jeren): Well, I mean, I was… I got today off, if you’re not busy.
Minna (as Myra): Oh! Oh, yeah. Let’s do that.
Rhi: So yeah, he looks kinda relieved and stands up and you can head out to have a friendly lunch.
Minna: I think they stand up and, like, Myra kind of stops him with a hand on his shoulder.
Minna (as Myra): Do you— is it okay if I hug you?
Rhi: He looks surprised and then will nod.
Minna: And she goes for a hug. I think it’s a short hug, like, one of those one-armed hugs. But a good, tight hug.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s a little awkward on Jeren’s side because he’s just not used to this.
Minna: [laughs] I think he’s taller than her, so she has to, like, reach up.
Rhi: Yeah. But he will hug you back. Good friendly hug and then a good friendly lunch.
Minna: Mm hmm!
##Music plays [00.40.36]
Rhi: The dark spiral on the wall is well worn as Kay runs her fingers over it in a familiar loop. It’s bad luck to go out on the water without seeking the favor of the father of the abyss first. The ritual completed, she heads for her gondola. Halfway there, she stops and snaps her fingers, then strides back to the boathouse. Bad luck to go out without the blessing, just plain foolish to go out without the package. Especially after all the trouble she went to to get it. She gets the package from her locker, then crosses the dock and steps into her gondola, quickly pulling away down the canal. She’ll make for her usual Nightmarket dock soon, but first, she has a delivery to make.
The water around Dunslough stinks, but Kay’s expression doesn’t change. It’s a familiar stench after all her days in Ironhook, and in a way it feels like coming home. Not a good home, mind, but home nonetheless. She ties her gondola off and climbs into a dark, narrow cleft in the canal wall, following the familiar tunnels into the catacombs.
Rhi (as Kay): Hey, Fishhook. Brought you a snack.
Rhi: For a while, nothing happens. Then Kay’s breath starts to mist in the cold air, and a spirit drifts through the wall. It’s slender, fragmented, not all there, but the prison tattoos on its arms burn bright, a ghostly match to the ones that Kay bears. She smiles grimly and sets down the package, a jar brimming with raw leviathan blood. The spirit surges towards it.
Rhi (as Kay): [sighs] Eat up, buddy. Only way to keep up your strength.
##Music plays [00.42.21]
Rhi: I think we see kind of the back area of The Reconciled compound, their hidden underground lair, and there is a very tall, kind of broad-shouldered woman with long dark hair, dark skin, sitting in a comfortable chair. And at first, she appears to be having a very animated conversation with thin air, but then the view kind of shifts to the ghost field and you can see that who she’s actually talking to is Tira, and this woman is also glowing with a possessor ghost. And the two of them are chatting away as Blaire, I think, enters the space. And as soon as Blaire comes in, Tira whips around as is like:
Rhi (as Tira): [gasps] Blaire! Oh, you’re here, you’re here, you’re here! That’s great! I have someone I need to introduce you to!
Kim (as Blaire): What, really? Yeah?
Rhi (as Tira): Yes! Yes, yes, yes, come here!
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, I’m coming.
Rhi: And like, she tries— she goes to grab at you and you just feel cold on your arm.
Kim: I mean, Blaire offers her wrist anyway. She knows.
Rhi: Aww. Yeah, so yeah, [laughs] Tira will lead you over to the woman who’s sitting in the chair and Tira very proudly is like:
Rhi (as Tira): Blaire Culhane, this is Zenovia.
Kim (as Blaire): Zenovia?
Rhi: Zenovia kind of inclines her head and is like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): It’s very good to meet you, Blaire. Tira has said a lot of very interesting things about you.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s wonderful to meet you, That’s a gorgeous name.
Rhi: And I think, Blaire, as you’re thinking about it, that name, like, it sounds kinda familiar.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And after a couple seconds it clicks that your family has some, like, alchemical research books written by Zenovia. This is an alchemist from Tycheros who died about a hundred years ago.
Kim: Oh. So, so if I may, in the middle of this conversation Blaire is just gonna be like:
Kim (as Blaire): Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. Wait. I’m sorry, I need to ask, you don’t mean to tell me that you’re The Zenvoia?
Rhi: And she gives this big grin, clearly pleased to be talking to someone who recognizes her and is like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): In the flesh.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps]
Rhi (as Zenovia): For the moment.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh my gods! I would ask for a hug if I could, oh my gods!
Rhi (as Zenovia): [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh my gods! Can you sign my books? Please?
Rhi (as Zenovia): I would be happy to, especially since it sounds like you are engaged in some very fascinating research. Tira has been telling me about it.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh my gods, oh my gods. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to freak out, I know that you’re just like a normal person, but oh my gods, you’re like my idol.
Rhi (as Zenovia): [laughs] Well, that’s very flattering.
Rhi: And she will, like, gesture at a nearby seat. And I think Tira just like sits down cross-legged, but hovering in mid-air.
Kim: Aww!
Rhi: [laughs] And Zenovia is like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): So, Tira has told me about your work with trying to extract ghosts from spirit drugs?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh huh! Mm hmm, mm hmm, mm hmm.
Rhi (as Zenovia): It’s very bold research.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you really think so?
Rhi (as Zenovia): I think that you have taken on a very difficult challenge and I’m very interested to see if you are able to accomplish this. What sort of progress have you made so far?
Kim (as Blaire): [getting emotional] I’m sorry, it’s just— [clears throat] sorry, you’re the first person I’ve talked to who’s ever believed in me about this. Um… [clears throat]
Rhi: Oh no… [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Um… uh… no, no I— I— I haven’t… I haven’t made a ton of progress yet. Um, yeah.
Rhi (as Zenovia): Well, what have you gotten so far? Have you moved out of anything theoretical, are you in a testing stage, or is it still working out formulas?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah— still working out formulas, but going to be moving into testing stage very soon.
Rhi: And I think that, like, she’ll pull out a book and ask to see Blaire’s notebooks, which she will sign.
Kim (as Blaire): [delighted gasp]
Rhi: And they, you know, she’ll kind of like start going over some notes and sharing some details and things, giving some suggestions for things that you could try. So, yeah, I think that— and the three of you, because Tira also pitches in occasionally, or Tira sometimes will ask questions. Because she was an alchemy student. She hadn’t finished her education yet, but sometimes she asks questions that will inspire one or the other of you to go off on some tangent of like, “Oh! Well, thinking about that, you know, combining those reagents in this way will do,” yada, yada, yada. You know, the three of you end up working together and I think that, you know, it’s several hours.
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Rhi: Other people kind of pass through and are just like, “Okay, they’re doing something. Alright. More power to ya.”
Kim: Yeah. Yeah!
Rhi: And I think that by the time that you kind of start getting to a point where, like, your eyes are blurring because you’ve been looking at books for so long, you have what feels like a potential path to making this work and some processes in mind for how to actually test this.
Kim: Yeah,
Rhi: You know, there’s still a little bit of work to be done, but you’re getting there. Tira, I think, is like… not napping, cause ghosts don’t really need to sleep, but she’s kind of just wandered off at some point.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, I think that Zenovia will kinda stretch her shoulders back and be like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): Oof, I forgot what having a body felt like. It’s been a little while. [sighs] I think that I may need to eat something.
Kim (as Blaire): I have a little bit of electroplasm, if you want it to hold you over?
Rhi: She’s just kinda like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): Um, sure, yeah, that’ll be something until I can find something better. That’d be appreciated, thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, absolutely, absolutely!
Kim: And Blaire’s just gonna hand over all the electroplasm that she has.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, so she kinda like holds the jar in her hands and the glow drains out of it and she kind of, like, seems to perk up a little bit, sits up a little bit and is like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): [sighs] Thanks. Appreciate that.
Rhi: And will set it aside.
Kim (as Blaire): No, no, thank you. I cannot thank you enough for this.
Rhi (as Zenovia): I’m glad I could help. And I hope this works out. I’m passing through on my way down to Imperial City, but I had some old contacts here and thought I’d stop in and see how they were getting on.
Kim (as Blaire): So, does this mean I’m never gonna see you again?
Rhi (as Zenovia): Oh, I wouldn’t say that. I intend to be around for quite a long time, and you look very young.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasps] I am very young!
Rhi: [laughs] Blaire says as if this is an accomplishment she’s proud of.
Kim: I mean, she’s nineteen. [laughs]
Rhi: Oh no, she’s a tiny baby.
Kim: She’s baby.
Rhi: Yeah, I think Zenovia will just kinda laugh and be like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): So, you never know. There’s a lot happening here in Duskwall, I’m sure I’ll pass through again.
Kim (as Blaire): Whoa, yay!
Rhi (as Zenovia): And if I do, where should I look you up?
Kim (as Blaire): Um, you can always find me at Nightmarket, in The Hound’s Paw.
Rhi (as Zenovia): Hound’s Paw. Alright, I’ll keep that in mind. But, uh—
Kim (as Blaire): Um… um… can I ask one more thing of you before you go?
Rhi (as Zenovia): Uh, yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Can I have a hug?
Rhi: She kinda smiles and is like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): Yes, yes, you may have a hug.
Kim (as Blaire): [gasp of joy]
Rhi: And she will give you a hug. Pat pat.
Kim (as Blaire): [happy laugh]
Rhi (as Zenovia): Okay, please don’t—
Kim: Blaire’s crying.
Rhi (as Zenovia): Oh, please don’t cry, oh no, oh… please don’t cry.
Kim (as Blaire): [through tears] I’m sorry, I can’t help it, I… [sobs] You’re my favorite.
Rhi (as Zenovia): Oh… um… uh…
Rhi: [laughs] She seemed fine before, but as soon as crying starts, she gets very flustered. It’s like:
Rhi (as Zenovia): Um… uh, here.
Rhi: She will hand you a handkerchief. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh… [sobs] thank you.
Rhi: Awkward shoulder pat.
Kim (as Blaire): Um, do you want this back?
Rhi (as Zenovia): Uh, no. I have other ones. You can—
Rhi: Because I imagine Blaire dabbing at her eyes meaning that she’s gotten it smudged with black. [laughs]
Kim: I mean, she’s also blown her nose, too, so… [laughs]
Rhi: Oh, yeah.
Rhi (as Zenovia): No, you can keep that. That’s fine.
Kim (as Blaire): Really? You mean it?
Rhi (as Zenovia): Yes… yes. I’m gonna… I need to—
Kim (as Blaire): Oh my gods!
Rhi (as Zenovia): Okay. Uh… are you gonna be alright?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm hmm, I’ll be okay!
Rhi (as Zenovia): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m gonna—
Rhi (as Zenovia): Tira? Could you…
Kim (as Blaire): I’m gonna keep this forever!
Rhi (as Zenovia): Okay, I think Tira’s gonna make sure that you get settled and see you out, but it was really good meeting you and I hope that this works out for you. I look forward to hearing about it.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you so much…
Rhi: And then she’s gonna just kind of sidle out of the room. [laughs] And Tira’s just like:
Rhi (as Tira): Are you okay?
Kim (as Blaire): [sniffs] Mm hmm. Mm hmm, yeah, I’m good.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): I’ll be good.
Rhi (as Tira): Are you sure?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm hmm. I just…
Rhi (as Tira): You’re leaking. Like, a lot.
Kim (as Blaire): I know! It’s fine.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay…
Kim (as Blaire): It’s good leaking, I promise.
Rhi (as Tira): Okay.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): I got to hug my idol and she gave me her handkerchief and… it’s just a very good day!
Rhi (as Tira): It was pretty cool.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah…
Rhi (as Tira): She’s nice.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, she’s super nice!
Rhi: So, I think Tira will kind of talk to you until Blaire has calmed down enough to be able to safely walk the streets of Duskwall. [laughs] But yeah, Tira will see you to the door and send you on your way, and Blaire just, like, leaves with all kinds of notebooks and ideas and tears and a handkerchief.
Kim: Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
Rhi: [laughs quietly]
##Music plays [00.53.12]
Minna: So, Myra walks into Silkshore. There’s this neighborhood called Fogcrest that’s full of bohemians, basically, and students and stuff like that.
Rhi: The arts— the starving artist district.
Minna: Uh huh. Anyway, so she climbs up into Fogcrest. It’s on a hill and usually kind of, I mean, foggy, which gives it name. And there’s, I think, a narrow house up there that the Historical Society is based in. This is, I think, Kit’s house, but he keeps the bottom floor open for this kind of thing. They’ve got a small printing thing going, but mostly it’s just a meeting room that she finds herself in on the bottom floor.
Rhi: So, I’m picturing that it’s kind of a small meeting room, but lined with bookshelves.
Minna: Yeah. And, you know, there’s some chairs, but I think they’re pushed back against the wall right now. This is the headquarters of the Society for Northern Void Sea History. They have major meetings probably once a month where people kind of talk about what they’re working on and sometimes present stuff. But right now, it’s not a meeting. She’s just coming in to see Kit specifically.
Rhi: How did Myra get involved with this group? How did she meet Kit?
Minna: So, I don’t know if she’s actually met Kit face to face, necessarily, but these meetings, the monthly meetings that the society holds, are actually open to the public so that people can, you know, hear what’s going on. This is an academic society, but they’re not based in the university and they don’t wanna gatekeep like that. So yeah, she’s probably attended meetings and, like, listened to stuff and read some stuff, but she has not actually met Kit.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I think the way she encountered it was probably… she probably read some of Mhairi Markelson’s work. She’s a— fuck. I have so much lore on these kids. Mhairi Markleson is a visiting professor up at, I think, Charterhall University, and she’s done a lot of work in this area. But she probably read some of Mhairi’s work and somehow followed it back to, oh, there’s this society that’s putting this cool stuff out.
Rhi: Okay, cool. Yeah, I think Myra is maybe kind of skimming the shelves looking at some of the books that are up there and then the door swings open and this man comes bustling in. He’s fairly short. I’m picturing him as having, like, kind of a neatly trimmed beard and glasses.
Minna: Oh, I love that. Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. Comes bustling in, has a notebook tucked under one arm, and is like:
Rhi (as Kit): Uh, Miss Keel, right?
Minna (as Myra): Yes, that’s me.
Rhi (as Kit): Ah. Wonderful to meet you! I am Christopher Sutton. You can call me Kit.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, Kit.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh, I’m happy to, happy to. I’ve just been working on editing an essay and I could use the break.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Rhi (as Kit): You look familiar, have you been to some of our past meetings?
Rhi: And he kind of gestures for you to sit.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I’ve attended a few. I haven’t spoken up or anything, I’m just interested.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh, wonderful!
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Kit): What brings you here today?
Minna (as Myra): I actually had a bit of a proposal for you. Not trying to put more work on your desk, this is mostly my work, I just wanted your blessing. Um, I have some friends who’ve recently acquired a printing press, and I was thinking about sort of writing up some summaries, some reviews of the work that your society is doing, for a different audience.
Rhi (as Kit): Hmm. What sort of audience?
Minna (as Myra): Well, the major aim would be kind of more of a working-class audience. So much of your work is about kind of decentralizing history away from the universities, and I think that people learning more about it could be useful. At least educational.
Rhi (as Kit): Mm…
Rhi: He looks very thoughtful and is like:
Rhi (as Kit): Uh, I mean, I’m always looking to broaden our reach and I certainly think that there’s a great deal that can be learned from many of our histories. But as you said, I am rather busy myself. This would be an undertaking that you would be able to handle?
Minna (as Myra): Yes, absolutely. I’ve been reading these things for a little while now, I think really more the difficulty will be trying to write it in a way that does justice to the ideas that people put forth here.
Rhi (as Kit): I think that’s an excellent idea. And I think that it might be a good challenge for some of our more verbose authors here to see if they can’t be a little more succinct.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] I’m not necessarily asking them to be more succinct. I mean, if you’d be interested in asking authors to contribute, that would be fantastic. I had been more— I didn’t want to put more on anybody’s plate, I had planning to sort of write reviews, I guess. But absolutely, if you’d be willing to connect me with people.
Rhi (as Kit): I can think of a few who might be interested in this. And yes, let’s—
Minna: Myra screams internally. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] Myra’s gonna, like, walk out very calmly and then just be like, “Yes!” I think Kit is like:
Rhi (as Kit): I think there might be a few people I know who could be interested and, you know, I’d be definitely interested to see what you put together for your first couple editions. And if it seems like that’s getting some traction, then I think it would be a good collaboration. Especially since it doesn’t really add any more work to my desk. That’s my favorite kind of collaboration.
Minna (as Myra): I do… there’s one small— well, not small. There’s one aspect to this that I would like to discuss with you before we decide whether I’m putting my name on this or not.
Rhi (as Kit): Mm. I thought you were going to ask about funding, which—
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Rhi (as Kit): I can tell you right out, no.
Minna (as Myra): No. I did not believe that I could strain the society’s funds like that. Well, I’ve given you my real name. I am a member of a gang called The Magpies.
Rhi: Let me— pause for a second. I’m gonna do a fortune roll to find out if he knows who you are.
Minna: [laughs] Listen. She’s being better about putting people in danger without telling them.
Rhi: Yeah.
Rhi (as Kit): Um… Magpies… sounds familiar. I think maybe there were some news articles about that group a while back?
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Rhi (as Kit): I admit I really only tend to focus on current events in that they relate to the past, where I can sort of draw upon those lines.
Minna (as Myra): Mm. We’re getting a little bit notorious. If you heard about what happened at The Docks, we had a hand in that.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh. Oh my.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. So, whether or not I put my name on this, there’s always the possibility that you’ll be known to be friends with me.
Rhi (as Kit): Ah… hmm.
Minna (as Myra): I can…
Rhi (as Kit): I… think, for the time being, it might be best if you publish anonymously, or under a pseudonym.
Minna (as Myra): Yes. That is what I had suspected was the best idea. I just thought I would let you know that there is that possibility. Mind you, Duskwall being what it is, it’s already a risk being up here doing this, and I applaud you for it.
Rhi (as Kit): Well, I think usually not that kind of risk. Goodness.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Rhi (as Kit): Can I ask— I mean, you said a gang. Like, criminal gang? Is that correct?
Minna (as Myra): I mean, if you’ve read Tom Melling’s meditations on what it means to follow the law and what it means to follow— you know what, this is not going to work out. Yes, criminals.
Rhi (as Kit): Hmm. How… alright. Well, I suppose that is not exactly the reach I expected to have, but I’m glad that you’re interested and so enthusiastic about our work. I suppose maybe I should read up a bit more about what you are… what sort of… what sort of criminal? I need to— because are you, like… oh, you know… the sort of…
Minna (as Myra): We’re closer to revolutionaries than, say, the Billhooks.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh…
Rhi: [laughs] He’s swinging wildly between confused and intrigued. He’s having a day. He’s like:
Rhi (as Kit): Oh. Are you, like, affiliated with any of the Skovlan work, or…?
Minna (as Myra): Not precisely. But certainly, I mean, certainly I think that— I mean, I’m quite intrigued by them. We haven’t had as much dealing with that as I would like.
Rhi (as Kit): I see. Alright. I’ll have to, I guess, look into what sort of things you’ve been up to more. Although, god, I suppose whatever is in the Daily is going to be useless.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, don’t read about us in the Daily. [laughs]
Rhi (as Kit): [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): If you— have you ever— well, actually, I’ll bring this up. The printing press in question that I’m going to be using belongs to a pair of independent journalists named Lani and Roxanne Sathiri. I don’t know if you remember their work from—
Rhi (as Kit): Lani Sathiri! Yes, yes! Oh, she does incredible work.
Minna (as Myra): She does! They both do. So, that is why I thought that their work would actually mesh very well with your work.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh. Yes, yes. Yes, she did some excellent deep investigative pieces before the North Hook burned down.
Minna (as Myra): Which is why they have their own printing press now.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh, that’s wonderful.
Minna (as Myra): In case you’re wondering what The Magpies do, we did help them with that.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh. That’s good to hear. I will say this: You have my blessing to produce this publication as a collaboration with our society. I request that you publish either anonymously or under pseudonyms and try to avoid affiliation with any sort of criminal activity, as we are not equipped to handle such entanglements.
Minna (as Myra): That is what I thought was best as well.
Rhi (as Kit): Wonderful. And do send along some copies once you have your first edition printed. I will be interested to see it.
Minna (as Myra): I certainly will. Thank you for meeting with me.
Rhi (as Kit): Yes, well thank you for coming by. This was a far more interesting meeting than I anticipated.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Well, I think trying to lie to a historian has to be some kind of crime, right?
Rhi (as Kit): It certainly should be.
##Music plays [01.04.06]
Rhi: And so I think at this same time, elsewhere in Silkshore, in Ankhayat Park, which is the largest open space in the city, it’s home to a lot of festivals, public events, and we see sitting under a petrified tree, we see Nyryx sitting on a blanket that is spread out on the ground. There’s a basket next to her and she is looking around, clearly waiting for someone to arrive. And I think she spots someone approaching and brightens up and waves.
Josie: Yeah, it’s Minx.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: Despite the hour, she’s wearing a wide-brimmed… I guess they wouldn’t call them sunhats, but—
Rhi: Maybe like a day-hat.
Josie: Yeah. She is wearing very stereotypical picnic garb, but with just, like, puffy coat on outside. Like, a nice sundress and sunhat and honestly showing a bit more skin than usual, which means some of her scars are showing. But whatever, she’s just rocking it.
Rhi: Oh. Yeah!
Josie: And she rushes up to meet her girlfriend.
Rhi: She stands up and will give you a kiss hello and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): You’re a little bit late, I was starting to worry you got lost.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I just need to be fashionably late. Savor the moment, you see.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [laughs] Well come on, sit down.
Rhi: And she will open up the picnic basket and pulls out a small bottle of wine and the bottle opener. Or the, not bottle opener, corkscrew. And will just hand both of those to you. And then she starts kind of unpacking the rest of the picnic. And I think there’s… let’s see. Definitely some goat cheese and probably some crackers.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: And… let’s see… I’m trying to think of what else. What are some other… what’s some foods that Minx would like?
Josie: I feel like… well, it’s also a matter of what actually fuckin’ exists to be liked.
Rhi: Yeah, what’s available? Yeah…
Josie: I know. Minx really likes dip. Like, we already have cheese and crackers, so there’s gonna be a lot of things, like, chips and other things to dip and dip in.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Whatever that looks like in this universe.
Rhi: Yeah. Um, maybe there’s some kind of, like, mushroom dip and yeah, there’s like some— a couple different varieties of crackers. I think, yeah, so there’s goat cheese, there’s a couple, like, probably, honestly, some kind of seaweed dip and a mushroom dip and some crackers. And I think, kind of as you’re getting what is honestly probably a mushroom wine, you get that open, Nyryx, like, very proudly reaches into the bag and pulls out a small, hand-sized basket and holds it out to you and is just grinning. And is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Open it.
Josie: Minx will gingerly take a peek inside.
Rhi: It is filled to the brim with fresh strawberries.
Josie: Minx will look to Nyryx and back to the strawberries, and then rush in for a deep kiss on Nyryx. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, cause that’s the kind of thing that, like, she saved up for this.
Josie: Mm hmm. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, so Nyryx is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): I just, I wanted to do something special for you. You keep doing so many— you always surprise me with things. I wanted to surprise you with something.
Josie (as Minx): Thank you, Nyry.
Rhi: So, she will pull out a couple glasses and hold one out, or hold them both out so you can fill them. And then pass you one.
Josie: Clinky.
Rhi: Yeah. Well, what do they toast to?
Josie: Hmm. I think Minx would just say:
Josie (as Minx): To us.
Rhi: Yeah. Clink!
Josie: Clink! And Minx is leaning on Nyryx a little bit the whole time and sort of happily humming while she eats the strawberries.
Rhi: Aww! Yeah, I think they just have a nice picnic in the park. People-watch and enjoy their wine and, like, savor over those strawberries. And yeah, and just have a really nice, happy time in the park.
Josie: Yeah.
##Music plays [01.08.41]
Rhi: Elsewhere in Silkshore, we see Lani Sathiri hurrying through the narrow streets. Her thoughts are racing with what she’s uncovered. The Magpies are going to be devastated. Minx is going to be horrified. But they have to know. The ugliness of the city never gets easier to look at, but pretending it’s not there won’t make a difference.
Movement catches her eye and she looks up at the bridge expecting the worst, roaming spirits or armed thugs or lurking Bluecoats. But there’s nothing so dreadful here today. There’s a trio of acrobats performing on the side of the bridge, doing dramatic flips and leaps and tumbles, all above the slow-moving but still treacherous waters of the river Dosk.
There’s a small crowd gathered to watch and Lani drifts closer to join them. The three acrobats look similar enough that they could be siblings. It’s impossible to tell for sure, because they never hold still. The tallest of the three arcs over backwards, hands and feet planted on the bridge so his back forms an arch. One of the others tumbles under him while the other takes a running start and does a dramatic twisting dive over him. The pair come to their feet side by side and go into a series of leaps and flips. Lani grins at the performance and raises her hands in applause when the three of them come back together and take a bow. She doesn’t have much coin on her, but she tosses a few pieces of silver into their box before she continues on her way.
There’s ugliness in the city, yes, but there’s also moments of beauty and joy. It’s good to be reminded of that sometimes.
##Music plays [01.10.26]
Rhi: In any city, in any life, there are always moments to breathe. They may be hard to find sometimes, or feel few and far between, but when they come to you, take them. You’ll need them in the days ahead. After a couple weeks of moments to breathe, The Magpies have once again come together at The Hound’s Paw. Rigney delivers their drinks and a sealed envelope.
Rhi (as Rigney): That’s from Lani. Uh, she didn’t say what was in it but, um, well… she said that Minx, just try and think things through before you do anything?
Josie (as Minx): Um, I don’t think I’ve ever heard anything more ominous in my whole life. Okay.
Rhi (as Rigney): I know. I’m a little worried.
Rhi: So, yeah, he’ll hand over the envelope.
Josie (as Minx): Shall… should I open it, or should one of you two open it?
Minna (as Myra): Would you like me to?
Josie (as Minx): Yes, please.
Minna: Alright, Myra takes it and she opens it very quickly and shakes out the letter.
Rhi: It’s a single sentence in Lani’s handwriting. It says, “The final member of The Circle of Flame is the owner of The Red Lamp, Madame Tesslyn.”
Minna: I think Myra’s eyes widen. She hasn’t read it out loud yet. And she, like, looks up at Minx and she says:
Minna (as Myra): What’s the name of the owner of The Red Lamp again?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, Madame Tesslyn, I believe?
Minna (as Myra): That’s what I thought.
Kim (as Blaire): What does it say?
Minna (as Myra): She’s the last member of The Circle of Flame.
Josie: At that point there’s a—
Minna: Myra grabs Minx’s wrist—
Josie: Thud as Minx is two palms down on the table, standing up, ready to go.
Kim (as Blaire): Wh—
Minna: Myra has—
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, where are you going?
Minna: [laughs] Myra has grabbed one of her arms the second she moved.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Myra, if that’s true, we don’t have time.
Minna (as Myra): She’s been there and a member of The Circle of Flame for who knows how long already. It will keep until we can think this through and not do it in a way that will endanger Nyryx.
Josie (as Minx): [groans]
Josie: Hmm. Can I— I think I might need to make a roll. I think I need to, like…
Minna: Mm hmm…
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. I think that checks out.
Josie: Make a resistance roll.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. I think Resolve.
Josie: Okay. Okay, I got a 6. So, Minx just— [humph] and sits down with her arms crossed.
Minna: [whines]
Josie: She’s tapping her foot and ready to go, but she’s waiting.
Josie (as Minx): What plan do we need, other than kill her?

##Blooper [01.14.42]
Kim: I know, I’m sorry, but I needed to get it out.
Rhi: No. No, this is just— this, this, I didn’t realize this episode was gonna be a such a goldmine for the blooper reel, but here we are.
Kim: [laughs] I mean, are they even— is the blooper reel even gonna make sense? Because… the Discord chat isn’t in audio form. People don’t know what I’m reacting to.
Rhi: Just you screaming is sufficient. It’ll be a nice clip. Maybe that’ll be the stinger, just… [laughs]
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Kim giving a distant scream.
Kim: That’s a good stinger. Anyway. [clears throat]"
"Season 3, Episode 14: The Red Lamp Score, Part 1 Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us.
You can continue to support us in all the usual ways: tweeting about the show, backing us on Patreon, buying a pin, leaving a review. We appreciate all of it.
I don’t have a lot of extra announcements this episode which feels a bit weird. We are continuing to work through our backlog of episodes that need transcripts, and I’m cautiously optimistic that by the end of next month we’ll have all of Season 2 transcribed. So, if you or someone you know does better with transcripts than pure audio, you can find them on our site.
Picking the Featured Charity each month is always difficult because there are always so many good causes in need of support, but I don’t think I’ve ever had as much of a crisis about what cause to highlight as I did this month, so I’m going to talk about a few things that are no cost or low cost and then onto what I settled on as the charity.
First, MakeMasks2020.org is organizing people to sew face masks to donate to medical professionals and essential workers, so if like me you have a sewing machine and a stash of scrap fabric, particularly cotton, check that out. They have patterns and a lot of other really good resources for getting started on that.
For those of us in the US, please continue to call your representatives to demand universal basic income for at least the duration of the lockdown, mandatory paid sick leave for all workers, and as much protection in terms of employment, payment, and health care for the essential workers who are keeping society running right now. Calling doctors, nurses, delivery drivers and cashiers “heroes” is meaningless if we can’t make sure that they’re given the support and protection they need.
Finally, if you’re in a position where you can spare some money, my Featured Charity this month is your local food bank. With millions of people suddenly unemployed food banks have become a critical way for people to feed themselves and their families, and donating money is a much better option than donating food, because food banks have agreements with wholesalers and grocers to buy food at extremely low prices, meaning they can stretch a dollar a lot farther than you can.
If you do want to donate something tangible, consider things like diapers, formula, toothpaste, menstrual products, toilet paper, or pantry staples like cooking oil or spices. Many of these things aren’t covered by food stamps, and so many recipes rely on you having basic ingredients that not everyone can afford to keep stocked. This month I donated to the Greater Chicago Food Depository, but look for food banks in your area and see what you can do to support them.
Stay safe, stay in touch with the people you love, and take care of yourselves as much as you can.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:03:25]
Rhi: We open up on Nyryx who is dressed in very clearly nice and tailored but fairly simple clothes, and she is climbing the stairs in a very fine, richly appointed building. There’s sort of like a red carpeted runner up the stairs, the handrails are polished wood. As she’s climbing these stairs, about halfway up the stairs, a shadow falls across her. She looks up and smiles a little bit and nods, and Madam Tesslyn descends the stairs towards her and also smiles back.
Rhi (as Tesslyn): Ah, Nyryx. Wonderful to see you. How has everything been with you? Are you doing well?
Rhi: Nyryx will smile and nod.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Yes, yes, I’m doing very well. I’m just heading up for my break now.
Rhi: Tesslyn nods.
Rhi (as Tesslyn): You have a couple days off coming up. Are you planning on spending that with your, uh, partner? What was her name? Minx, right?
Rhi: Nyryx, her smile before had been kind of a… It’s the smile you give your boss. [laughs] It’s kind of a, you know, a polite smile, but when Minx is mentioned it becomes a lot more genuine, brighter, and she nods.
Rhi (as Nyryx): You know, it’ll depend what she’s up to, but probably. I hope so.
Rhi: Tesslyn’s smile fades a little bit, and then her brow furrows, looking a little worried.
Rhi (as Tesslyn): You know, you… I worry about you sometimes, seeing someone who is so… unpredictable. I know people like that can be very exciting, but very dangerous too, and I don’t want anything to happen to you.
Rhi: She puts a hand on Nyryx’s shoulder, and that genuine smile disappears and goes back to a very polite one. Nyryx gives her a nod and steps back away from her hand.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I appreciate the concern, Tesslyn, but I can take care of myself.
Rhi: They nod at each other, and Tesslyn tells her to have a good break, and they part. We first see Nyryx ascending the stairs and she just kind of rolls her eyes really dramatically and shakes her head a little, and then we cut over to Tesslyn who is continuing down the stairs with sort of a contemplative expression, and they part and go their separate ways.
So, where do we find the Magpies as they are plotting their next move now that they have learned that Madam Tesslyn is a member of the Circle of Flame?
Josie: First of all, Minx isn’t unpredictable, she is reckless and unstable, thank you.
[laughter]
Rhi: [smiling] Of course. My mistake. How could anyone equate those with unpredictable?
Josie: Like, we’ve seen what happens with Minx when she’s getting ready for a “party.”
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Stuff leaks out of her room. There’s a lot more stuff than should really be able to fit in there, and where does she get or afford it even?
Rhi: Please, as if Minx pays for these things.
Josie: Now it’s like that but with weapons. No doubt she filched or bought some on the way back to The Nest. Her hair is down. She just like tore it out of her bun when she got back. She’s switched into plain black rogue’s clothes and is contemplating what to take.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Blaire is going to be going over to Minx’s room and knocking on her door, if that’s cool.
Josie: Sure. I think the door is open, but she’s got her back to it.
Kim: Oh, okay, so…
Rhi: So that knock on the doorframe thing?
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, uh… yeah Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): What are we doing?
Josie (as Minx): We’re going to kill Madam Tesslyn, that’s what we’re doing.
Kim (as Blaire): Well yeah, but… you can’t just storm off without telling us anything.
Josie (as Minx): I’m not gonna storm off. We’re going together, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Only if we discuss it. You just kind of rushed into your room and started changing.
Josie (as Minx): What is there to discuss? We know exactly where she’s going to be and when. She’s going to be vulnerable. We just need to do it.
Kim (as Blaire): We need to not be stupid about it if we really wanna get this done.
Josie (as Minx): Are you calling me stupid?
Kim (as Blaire): [squirms] No, I’m just… [huffs] What I’m saying is, Minx… you’re angry right now, and rightly so, but if we wanna get this done and really, really get it done, we gotta do this right.
Josie (as Minx): How do you propose we do it right? Honestly, we’ve been too hesitant, taken too long before with the Circle members. Every minute we wait is, at this point, more people in danger. I don’t want to wait when it’s Nyryx in the line of fire.
Kim (as Blaire): I know. Neither do I. So, why don’t you just finish up what you’re doing in here and then we’ll meet at the table, we’ll figure out a game plan, and we will do this tonight.
Josie (as Minx): Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): All right?
Josie: She’s gonna pick up a—This one isn’t a cane sword. I think she probably only has one “real” sword that she got a while ago.
Kim: Ooh.
Josie: Mostly just as a mantelpiece, essentially, even though there’s no mantle in her room. I’m thinking it’s like a saber. No, no, it’s—
Rhi: Ooh, like a caval—Oh, go ahead, go ahead.
Josie: No, never mind, it’s like an epee.
Kim: Yeah!
Josie: Is that how you pronounce it?
Kim: Yeah, that is how you pronounce it.
Josie: Yeah, like a nice dueling sword with the hand guard and stuff.
Rhi: Yeah, and I think it’s the kind of thing that a lot of people would think that it’s just a decorative piece…
Josie: Right.
Rhi: …but it is sturdy and it is sharp.
Josie: Right, because even when she’s in a bad place she makes sure the aesthetic is on point.
Rhi: Yep.
Josie: Even if it’s a murder weapon. [laughs]
Rhi: Yep.
Kim: Of course.
Rhi: Myra, where are you at?
Minna: I think that when Blaire comes out of Minx’s room she finds Myra coming out of her own room, and she kind of gives Blaire a worried look.
Minna (as Myra): How is she?
Kim (as Blaire): Eh… focused, but you know, I think I talked her down a little. We’re gonna work out a plan and pull this off tonight.
Minna (as Myra): That’s good.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Meet downstairs?
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Rhi: The three of you can convene downstairs, and Minx, you actually just by virtue of having friends with and girlfriends with Nyryx for basically the entire time she’s worked at the Red Lamp, you know a lot about how the place works. It’s a four-story building, big stately place with a marble façade. The ground floor is like the reception area. There’s a bar and lounge area. You all have been to the lounge a few times. The ground floor also has a couple administrative offices for some of the support staff, the security office, there’s a small on-site clinic, and then a handful of rooms for employees or clients who for whatever reason can’t make it upstairs.
The second and third floor are primarily the rooms for the employees. The third floor also has a chunk that’s kind of like the employees only area. There’s a lounge with a little kitchen, private bathrooms with showers and bathtubs and stuff, you know, nice little relaxing area. Then the fourth floor is Tesslyn’s penthouse. Nyryx doesn’t know a ton about that. she has only been up there a few times, and only, when she’s been up there it’s pretty much only been in like the front parlor area.
You also know, Minx, that there’s a lot of—this place has a lot of security.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: There’s a lot of security personnel, probably at least a dozen guards, and there are very high quality spark-craft security systems that specifically are silent alarms so that if, you know, an employee needs to raise an alarm without potentially alerting their client they can do that and the guards will be there very quickly. Minx, what you have kind of gotten from Nyryx is that whatever else Tesslyn may be involved in, whatever else she’s involved in being part of the Circle of Flame, it’s not good, but…
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: …she takes good care of her employees. She makes sure that everybody is safe and comfortable and well-compensated. You’ve always in the past been very grateful, I think, for the level of security on this place, but now you’re having to figure out how to overcome it. So that is kind of what you know going in. what other info would you like to have, or what other plans would you like to make?
Josie: I would be remiss if I didn’t ask about the buildings on either side of the Red Lamp.
[laughter]
Rhi: Of course. God, it’s been a while since you’ve done one of those, huh?
Minna: It’s been a while.
Josie: It may not be one of those, but we should know.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Why don’t you go ahead and make—This doesn’t have to necessarily be like you’re leaving The Nest right this moment to go look, because you’ve been there enough, you know what it is, but just give me some kind of roll for kind of what Minx has observed when she’s been in the area in the past. You can do Study, you can do Survey, you could do something else if you’d like.
Josie: Is this a Gather Info?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Josie: Five.
Rhi: So, yeah, I think that… You got a 5. On one side is a townhome that I think has been converted into apartments. It used to be a single unified thing and now it’s like a three flat. Yeah, so that’s a three-story building, but there’s a decent size alley between the two. On the other side is a four-story apartment building.
Josie: Uh-huh. Well, that’s good.
Rhi: But there’s again, like, they’re not right up on each other, there’s an alley wide enough to get a carriage down on either side, so ‘doable’ that you could get across, but it would be… you’d probably need to string some ropes and climb across it. It probably isn’t really jumpable.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: But yes, those are the buildings on either side. I will also mention—I forgot to mention this—about the security. The security there, they work for the Red Lamp. They are not like Umbra Hunters, or… as far as you know, not affiliated with the Circle in any way.
Josie: Right. So, a higher level entry is possible, although given the location it may be such that we can just walk in the front door, because she does not know that we know.
Minna: Yeah. I mean, we can walk in the front door, but getting up higher I think would be our issue.
Josie: Well that would be a simple matter of asking after the woman herself. She has no reason at the moment to suspect that we know, and if we make our reason innocuous enough…
Minna: Huh… [smiling] I guess we could just go with walking in the front door. That’s a possibility.
Kim: Is it?
Minna: It depends on how compelling we make our reason and whether she would see us on short notice.
Kim: Yeah. Yeah…
Josie: Right.
Rhi: She is—And also, like, she is a member of the Circle of Flame.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: The Circle knows who you all are.
Kim: Right.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Right. She knows that I’m a Magpie, but she doesn’t know that I know that she’s a Circle member.
Rhi: Right. Right. Okay, yeah.
Josie: And last time we met she was keeping that illusion even though she knew, because she specifically gave me the ghost information to mess with me. I also think it’s at this point, around the table, that Minx realizes:
Josie (as Minx): Oh, she’s the one who told me. She absolutely told me that to mess with me. I…
Kim (as Blaire): What did she tell you?
Josie (as Minx): Something private with me and Nyryx’s relationship. Something she shouldn’t have known, but I didn’t think about that at the time because I was distraught. [sniffs]
Kim (as Blaire): How long ago was this?
Josie (as Minx): A month or two, although you would be proud of me, Blaire, I think. Looking after a spirit isn’t that difficult.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah… I mean, yeah, there is that.
Josie (as Minx): What, no reaction?
Kim (as Blaire): Well, that’s not really my concern here right now, Minx. My concern right now is, you know, getting to stop Tesslyn.
Josie (as Minx): Drat. I was saving that to be dramatic. I’ll have plenty of opportunity tonight.
Kim (as Blaire): [as a sigh] Hoo-boy.
Josie (as Minx): I am of the mind that I should ask Bazso if he wants to help.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think he’ll agree?
Josie (as Minx): For Nyryx, probably.
Minna (as Myra): We could do that.
Josie (as Minx): I’ve asked a lot of him, but this wouldn’t be for me, and this would solidify whether he still cares.
Rhi: I’m definitely interested to see how ‘that’ goes, but I think first, Myra and Blaire, is there any info that you two would like to…?
Minna: I almost wanna try and keep an eye on Nyryx while all this is happening, because she has the potential of being used as a pawn or bargaining tool.
Kim: Oh, that’s a good point.
Josie: Right. She would be working, wouldn’t she?
Minna: So how do we keep her safe, too? Are her appointments scheduled out, or could we get an appointment with her and just basically pay her to stay there and be safe with us? [chuckles]
Rhi: Minx, you know that the way that her appointments work is that sometimes she’ll have people book in advance and sometimes, you know, it’s just kind of like hang out in the lounge and people will come in for, sort of, like—She has scheduled blocks and then open blocks, basically.
Josie: Right.
Minna: Can I try and get a scheduled block? That way it gives Minx a good time to go where I can at least, somebody can at least keep an eye on her?
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: Also, one of us booking her for an hour is going to be fucking suspicious.
Rhi: [smiling] Yeah. Well, if you use your real name, yeah! [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Well, I assume one of us has to make sure she’s fine, like, this is partly so somebody has eyes on her to make sure she’s not being kidnapped by a guard.
Rhi: Yeah-yeah-yeah.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Yeah, no, this makes total sense.
Josie: That’s a good plan. I think someone should, under an assumed name, book a meeting with her and then fill her in during that time.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: [giggles] Poor Nyryx.
Minna: Keep her there and safe.
Rhi: She’s just gonna be like, “Myra…?”
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: “I have so many questions, and also—” I mean, I feel like she would be like, I can’t, we can’t do this, you are too close to my girlfriend. I can set you up with someone else. [laughs]
Minna: “I don’t want to do this. It’s fine.” [laughs] Okay, now I want it to be Myra just to play out this awkward fucking scene. [laughs]
Josie: Yes. [laughs and claps]
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That’s gonna be really good. Okay, yeah, so Myra, if you wanted to do that… I mean, are you aiming to get something tonight, because you’re planning on doing this tonight?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Go ahead and give me a roll. You wouldn’t be setting this up necessarily with Nyryx directly.
Minna: What roll do we think this is?
Rhi: I would think maybe Sway?
Minna: It’s Sway, because I’m lying.
Rhi: [giggles] “Yes, I would definitely like to book an hour to… sleep with someone.”
Minna: Five.
Josie: [laughing] Yeah, fuckin’ aro/ace Myra.
Minna: [smiling] Leave me alone.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. Yeah. I love that it is the… our very ace character who is setting this up. It’s gonna be a great conversation.
Minna: [laughs, smiling] Listen, it’s fine. Nothing’s going to happen.
Rhi: [chuckling] No, for so many reasons. You got a 5, you said?
Minna: Yes. Yeah, I did.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, I think that with that, basically this is less information… That roll was less about information and more about kind of like… Is there a particular time that you all are kind of aiming for with when you wanna do this?
Josie: Probably not peak hours.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Peak thirst hours.
Rhi: [giggles]
Minna: Three AM.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah. The early hours of the morning, probably that’s towards the end of Nyryx’s—I think that she’s got a night shift on this particular day. So yeah. You’re aiming for 3 AM. I think you get about, like, you get a little earlier than that.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So there’s a possibility there will be more people around than you would prefer, but it’s still late enough that it’s probably not gonna be a lot of new customers coming in.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Or leaving. So yeah, I think that you’re able to get that. What name do you give?
Minna: Hmm… [smiling] I didn’t come up with a name. Give me a second. [laughs]
Rhi: That’s okay. [laughs]
Josie: Misha Koros.
Minna: That works.
Josie: That was your cover identity in Minx’s fan fiction.
Minna: Oh my God.
[laughter]
Kim: Wow.
Minna: Which fan fiction? Oh, is this the Lyra Langdon ID?
Josie: Yep, sure is.
Minna: Aw. Yeah, let’s just do that. Oh God. Now I’m curious if Minx has shared this fan fiction. [giggles]
Rhi: Mm-hmm~
Josie: Yes. That’s what she was—
Minna: [gasps] Wait! So, do we want Nyryx to know or no?
Josie: Oh, shared it with Nyryx.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Oh. That would be funny. [laughs] Nyryx is like, wait.
Rhi: Yeah. I think when we get into the score the engagement roll may determine whether or not Nyryx remembers that name or recognizes that name.
[giggling]
Rhi: Okay, but point is, you are able to get your alias booked for an hour at about like 2 in the morning. Blaire, what did you have in mind?
Kim: Yes. I want to investigate specifically Madam Tesslyn’s superstitions and what to expect on the spiritual end of security, which I probably already know, but if I could get more info on Madam Tesslyn specifically…
Rhi: Absolutely. Yeah. You can definitely look into that. How do you want to go about that?
Kim: I mean, being a Circle member she’s probably too smart to leave a paper trail.
Rhi: Correct.
Kim: So… and I don’t think we’re going over there to investigate beforehand, right?
Rhi: It’s a busy enough area that if you wanted to do an Attune roll to kind of case the joint through the ghost field you could do that.
Kim: Oh! Oh. Would my vice purveyor, Aranna, would she know anything?
Rhi: Let’s find out. [laughs] That’s what the roll tells us.
Kim: Great. I’ll roll a Consort then. Let me do that.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it.
Kim: That’s a 3 and a 6.
Rhi: A 6, okay, great. So, yeah, you go and talk to Aranna who is a cult member of a forgotten god. Yeah, I think that you get really lucky with this and that the cult that Aranna is part of has provided some custom-made talismans and wards for Tesslyn.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: She has the building heavily warded but in very specific ways. Normally, majority of people who have middle class or higher money, you pay to have your home or your business warded against spirits. That’s just kind of standard operating procedure in Duskwall. Tesslyn has had these custom wards designed, custom talismans and charms.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Aranna tells you that Tesslyn is pretty proficient with this sort of stuff. She kind of used these custom ones as the basis for wards that she set herself. It’s bound specifically against unbound spirits, so just sort of spirits that are freely moving around.
Kim: Oh…
Rhi: Spirits that are in jars, or people, can move through the wards without a problem. Additionally, the building has a lot of wards against demons, which most people don’t bother with. [laughs] And the way that they were set up is that… Normally when you ward a place you want it to just be like, you’re building a wall, basically.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: The demon wards are a gate that she has the ability to open and close.
Kim: Ohh… Interesting.
Rhi: On a 6 you can ask some follow-up questions if you’d like to know any more about that.
Kim: I do have a follow-up question. When you said the ward is against unbound spirits, does that mean it would still… if I were to unleash a spirit, would the ward protect against that, or because it’s bound to my command it’s fine?
Rhi: You would be able to bring it past the wards in the jar, and then from what Aranna knows, if a loose spirit got out she’s pretty sure that there are kind of like… I mean, honestly, I’m picturing almost like Ghost Busters style traps that will sort of trigger and hold the spirit.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: Not like on every square inch but throughout the space, that if there was a loose spirit roaming around it would not be able to do so for very long.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. All of that strikes you as an odd setup to have. You’re not exactly sure what it means, but it’s odd.
Kim: That she would have demonic connections? Yeah. Possibly.
Rhi: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Kim: Something to ask Setarra about, maybe. We’ll see.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay. Let’s jump back to Minx. You wanted to go talk to Bazso. How does this meeting happen? Do you go to…?
Josie: I think she goes right up to the HQ and knocks politely on the door.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. There’s a couple guards outside, sort of the usual song and dance of one of them goes inside to tell Bazso that you’re here to see him, and I think that, yeah, after a couple minutes the guard comes back, you’re escorted up to his office. You have to wait outside for a little bit, and you can kind of hear low voices inside, and then, yeah, a couple people come out. One of them has what looks like a fresh black eye. [chuckles]
Josie: [laughing] Oh boy.
Rhi: But like, it doesn’t… Other than that, it doesn’t look too bad, like it doesn’t look like Bazso just beat the shit out of someone. It just looks like… This is something I feel like you know Bazso well enough to be like, oh, this person fucked up, Bazso punched him once, and now they’re cool!
[laughter]
Rhi: It wasn’t such a significant fuck-up that he had to kill him, it’s just you fucked up, pop him in the face, now we’re good.
Josie: Eh, sounds about right.
Rhi: So they leave. I think that they have some, like, it looks like a rolled up map that they’re carrying. They don’t really pay much attention to you. Yeah, you can head inside. Bazso is behind his desk sorting through some papers and stuff, looks up and just kinda like…
Josie: Minx is still disheveled, kind of, just in black with hair down.
Rhi: Yeah, he looks up and I think does a bit of a double-take. When you told the guards who you were, did you say that Minx is here to see Bazso or Ellie is?
Josie: That Ellie is.
Rhi: Thought so. So he looks up, and he looks a little worried.
Rhi (as Bazso): What’s going on?
Josie (as Minx): Not to sound patronizing, but you know what the Circle of Flame is, yeah?
Rhi (as Bazso): Uh, I mean, a little bit. I know that they’ve been fucking with you and you’ve been fucking with them back. Made my life difficult recently. Don’t know much more.
Josie (as Minx): Turns out Madam Tesslyn’s one of them. Wanna come help kill her?
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Josie: I think this is gonna be Consort.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
Josie: It’s a 5.
Rhi: I think when you say it’s madam Tesslyn his eyes go wide. I think he’d been standing up, shuffling through some papers, and he kinda drops into his chair.
Rhi (as Bazso): Shit… Nyryx is okay? Is she okay?
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, she’s fine, right now.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah. Fuck.
Josie (as Minx): Me and the girls are planning on going after her tonight.
Rhi (as Bazso): Tonight? I mean, shit, Yeah. Fuck. Fuck! [heavy exhale]
Josie (as Minx): I won’t blame you if you don’t come, if you kinda just don’t wanna associate with both of us anymore, then whatever, that’s your prerogative.
Rhi (as Bazso): Come on! Ellie… [sighs] Look. You and me have had our problems, but it’s Nyryx. [exhales]
Josie (as Minx): That’s why I’m here.
Rhi (as Bazso): Okay. I can’t have somebody like that… I can’t have somebody at Tesslyn’s level’s blood on my hands for what I’m trying to do here. That said, I am not just gonna… I’m not gonna not do anything. What would help? What would make this easier for you?
Josie (as Minx): Really, it’s their guards we’re worried about. Just a sheer numbers thing.
Rhi (as Bazso): Got it. A few of my people who wanted to get out of this life, go a little more legit, Nyryx helped me get them jobs there. I can talk to them, see if they’ll let you in a side door. It’s not gonna get you all the way up, and I can… me and a couple of my people, we can hang around, cover the streets in case any Bluecoats decide to show up or anybody else that somebody like that can call on.
Josie: Minx’s face kind of softens a little bit.
Josie (as Minx): Thanks Bazso. That means a lot. Every little bit helps.
Rhi (as Bazso): Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): I’ll get as far as you can take me, and then I’ve got two hands and a sword, so…
Rhi (as Bazso): Well, you’re not going in solo. You got those friends of yours.
Josie (as Minx): [chuckles] That’s true.
Rhi (as Bazso): I don’t need to tell you this, and you’re probably gonna be pissed at me for saying it, but… you make sure she’s all right.
Josie (as Minx): Of course I will.
Rhi: He nods.
Rhi (as Bazso): All right. Get the fuck out of here. I got work to do, and I think you do too.
Rhi: He’s not saying it in like an angry way. He kinda gives you a half grin as he stands up.
Josie: Minx will give a weak smirk before leaving.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay. That went pretty good. Yeah, he’s gonna basically, if anything happens where outside interference would be coming in, he’s going to extend the clock.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Where maybe it would have been a 4 it’ll be a 6 or an 8. He’s gonna be able to slow people down, and you getting in will go a little better. So let’s do the engagement roll then. This is gonna be a 2d6 roll. Fun fact: If you roll dice on an open book, both dice will end up tilted at an angle.
[laughter]
Kim: Interesting.
Minna: Reroll, on a flatter surface.
Rhi: Okay, that’s a 6.
Kim: Oh, awesome.
Josie: Nice.
## Score [0:32:15]
Rhi: Let’s start with Myra. You show up at the Red Lamp at the appointed time and head over into the lounge. Nyryx is sitting in one of the lounge chairs…
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: …and her expression doesn’t change an inch when she sees you. She just gives you a warm smile and stands up and, you know, kind of takes your hands.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Misha, it’s so wonderful to meet you. Come with me and I can give you a tour of the place.
Rhi: She does not give you a tour.
Minna: [grinning] Mm-hmm!
Rhi: She walks you straight up to the second floor to her room. She opens the door, she ushers you in, she closes the door, locks it, turns around and goes:
Rhi (as Nyryx): You wanna explain what the fuck is going on, Myra?
[laughter]
Josie: I love her.
Minna (as Myra): It is not in fact what, uh, what it appears to be. You’re fine. Don’t worry.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I figured, for a great number of reasons.
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm. No, I’m just here to keep you safe, for an hour or so.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Keep me safe from what?
Rhi: [laughing] And I think on that, we smash cut so that Minna can decide how much Myra tells her. We cut over to a side door of the building.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Minx and Blaire are coming down this side alley. There’s a couple guards standing outside, and they see the two of you and just kinda look you over. It looks like they’re kind of studying you to make sure that you match a description. One of them is like:
Rhi (as guard): Names?
Josie (as Minx): Ellie.
Kim (as Blaire): Blaire Culhane.
Rhi: They nod and open up the door, open it a crack and then they both look back and be like:
Rhi (as guard): Tesslyn’s the only one that you hurt here, all right? Anybody else gets hurt and we’re gonna do our fucking jobs.
Josie (as Minx): That’s the idea.
Kim (as Blaire): Understandable.
Rhi: They open up the door, and you are kind of in a back hallway. This is a part that you haven’t seen, Minx, but it’s kind of back in the administrative office area. There’s storage closets, and the laundry room is down here, things like that, and then there’s the back stairs that wend their way up through the building basically so that the cleaning staff can move through the building without being seen out in the hallways very much.
Josie: Ah… okay.
Rhi: Now, I will point out that the two guards who let you in know what you’re doing, but the rest of the guards do not. [laughs]
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: So you will need to evade them.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, I think to kind of make it up to the second floor without detection we will need some kind of roll, or without risking detection.
Josie: Maybe a group Prowl here? I have 2 stress. I don’t know how much Blaire has.
Kim: I have completely 0 stress, so I can lead if you need me to.
Josie: Yes please.
Kim: Okay. What are we rolling?
Rhi: A controlled Prowl.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: This is gonna be standard effect. So yeah, both of you go ahead and roll Prowl.
Josie: [cringing] Well, I got a 2.
Kim: I got a 5?
Rhi: Five. Okay! So, you hesitate. Withdraw and try a different approach or do it with a minor consequence. I think what happens is you start up the stairs, and I think it’s not just a straight shot up, it goes up and then there’s a landing and then it turns and continues up. You’re about at the landing when you hear footsteps in the hall above you.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, somebody’s up there, and you can either withdraw and try a different approach or you can continue with, you know, do it with a minor consequence, basically.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Josie: I’m in favor of doing it with a minor consequence.
Kim: That’s what I was gonna say. Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Let’s see… [reading] Minor complication, reduced effect, harm makes zero sense… I think it’s just that you’re gonna be in a risky position now.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: You basically get to the landing and you can see shadow moving up above you, and you get a glimpse of a couple guards who seem to just be walking the halls. They’re just on patrol as it were.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You’ve got at least two guards that are moving around in this area. Yeah, as Minx and Blaire are kind of crouched on these stairs, waiting for the guards to pass, we cut back over to Nyryx’s room. What has Myra opted to tell her?
Minna (as Myra): Has Minx told you much about the Circle of Flame?
Rhi: I’m trying to remember. I don’t think that she has. Right?
Josie: No. I think Nyryx knew we were at war with someone for a while, but…
Rhi: Yeah. Minx has gone to great lengths to not tell Nyryx about a lot of what she’s tangled up in. Okay, so Nyryx folds her arms.
Rhi (as Nyryx): No. She doesn’t really tell me a lot about what you all get up to.
Minna (as Myra): They are a very dangerous organization, and their members have not shown much hesitation to hurt people we’re close with to get to us.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Is that… They went after Harker, didn’t they? A few months ago Minx came over and was really worried about something happening to me, and…
Minna (as Myra): They did.
Rhi (as Nyryx): She said that people…
Minna (as Myra): They’ve gone after multiple people. Now—
Rhi (as Nyryx): And you think they’re coming after me?
Minna (as Myra): Not yet, but there’s a large risk tonight that it could happen, so I’m here to keep you safe.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Why tonight? What’s happening?
Minna (as Myra): We found out the identity of the last member of the Circle of Flame.
Rhi: We jump back to Blaire and Minx on the stairs. You’re approaching the second floor. There’s guards about. I think to safely continue on to the third floor without being spotted it’ll need to be another roll, and you’re in a risky position.
Josie: Okie-dokie.
Kim: It’s probably gonna be another Prowl, right?
Josie: Yeah, I guess another group Prowl?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Kim: I can lead again.
Josie: Okie-dokie. You know what, I think I am gonna push myself on this one.
Rhi: All right.
Josie: Just to make absolutely sure.
Kim: All right, that’s a 6.
Rhi: Oh, all right.
Josie: And a critical.
Kim: Whoa!
Rhi: Jesus. Okay.
Josie: Woo. [laughs]
Kim: So, what does that mean for my stress? I don’t take anything?
Rhi: You take no stress, and you do it with increased effect.
Kim: Wow.
Rhi: Yeah. So, I think that the two of you just kinda wait there for a little bit, and the guards loop around the top of the stairs and then head off down the hall towards where the rooms are, and then you just walk up the stairs to the third floor, and now you’re on the third floor.
Josie: We have the power of dramatic timing on our side.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. You’re up on the third floor. There don’t appear to be guards actively patrolling up here right now. Now, the thing is, you have reached the third floor and you do not see any stairs that go up further.
Josie: Interesting, so we have to go looking for those.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: Okay. Is it just like a hallway full of doors?
Rhi: Pretty much. So like, if you kinda go out to… What I’m picturing is that you’re in sort of a little foyer type area that has a door, and if you crack that door open and peer down, yeah, it’s a very nice sumptuous hallway with a soft carpet, and yeah, doors just kinda lining on both sides, and then the hallway turns about five or six doors.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You’re not sure what else is down there.
Josie: Yeah. I don’t have any clever ideas here. I think we just need to go through and…
Rhi: Start looking around?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Make some rolls to see what you can find.
Josie: I’m gonna do a Survey.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Do we wanna do a group Survey?
Kim: If you want. Yeah. Let’s do that.
Rhi: This is still risky.
Kim: Five.
Josie: I got a 2.
Rhi: Two, okay.
Josie: Sorry. [laughs]
Kim: That’s okay.
Rhi: Blaire’s gonna take another point of stress. Result is a 5. You do it but there’s a consequence. So, I think you creep down the hall, creep-creep-creep-creep-creep, and peer around the corner. What you can see is there’s a set of double doors. There’s a few more doors that go into private rooms, and then there’s a set of double doors that, Minx, you’re guessing that’s the employee only area, like the employee lounge and stuff. You see that, and Minx, you’re guessing that based on the layout of this place that probably the access to the penthouse would be somewhere back in that employees only area.
Josie: Probably.
Rhi: You’re standing, you’re kind of both peeking around the corner looking at these double doors, and behind you, you hear a door unlock as someone has finished a session and is going to be walking their client out.
Josie: Well, that’s behind us. We can duck around the corner, right?
Rhi: Yes, but the risk is that you’re going to get seen. Basically it’s kind of reduced effect in that you did not make it all the way to the place you need to get. You’ll need to make another roll to get to the lounge area, and then there’s a possibility that you’ll get spotted by these people.
Josie: Right. I think if we just move around the corner and are quiet for a second we can avoid being seen here.
Rhi: It will need to be a roll though.
Josie: Yeah, so I’m thinking Prowl, unless Blaire wants to do something different.
Kim: Yeah, definitely a Prowl again. No, Prowl for sure. I want to maintain stealth as long as we can.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: You gonna group?
Kim: Sure.
Josie: I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay. Is Blaire still leading?
Kim: Yeah. I got a 2.
Rhi: Okay, so Blaire, you’re gonna take a point of stress.
Kim: Uh-huh.
Rhi: You two, you hear this door starting to open and you whip around the corner and just kind of freeze, and you can kind of hear low voices talking as the door opens, and the conversation falters for a second, and then there’s a bit of a pause, and then it picks up again and you can hear them walking away down the hall. I think that you can kind of- The tenor- Like, you can’t hear the specific words, but the tenor of the conversation has changed from a warm, affectionate afterglow type conversation to a little more urgent and concerned, so I’m going to start a clock…
Kim: Uh-oh.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: …for Security is Alerted.
Kim: No~
Rhi: We’re gonna put that at 1 out of 4. Basically one of the employees is like, just saw, didn’t get a good look at you but saw people whip around the corner who don’t look like they belong here and is like, I’m just gonna let somebody know that something weird is happening up on the third floor and not be here.
Minna: Hmm…
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But the two of you are able to kind of continue down to the lounge, and I think that as you reach those doors we’re gonna cut back down to Myra.
Minna (as Myra): So we’ve been looking for her for a while, and it turns out that your employer is that remaining member, which obviously means you’ve been in a lot more danger than we realized up until now.
Rhi: Nyryx is frowning really intensely and sits down on the edge of the bed, kind of twisting her hands together.
Rhi (as Nyryx): She’s always been so good to us, to me, to everybody here. Are you certain?
Minna (as Myra): Pretty sure, yeah. We’ve got some friends who have been doing research into this for gotta be months now and I trust their research.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Where’s Minx? Why isn’t she the one here? Why are you here?
Minna (as Myra): Because Minx has a job to do.

## Blooper [0:45:52]
Rhi: Okay. Saying “sync” there took a lot of effort, because as I was counting down my brain suddenly was like “3, 2, 1, Minx.”
[laughter]
Minna: Aww!
Kim: That’s very cute.
Rhi: And I was just like, no, that’s not what we say, brain! If you say that you’re gonna throw everyone off and we’re gonna have to do this again! [giggles]"
"Season 3, Episode 15: The Red Lamp Score, Part 2 Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us.
I want to give an extra thank you to our patrons whose support is now just above $400 a month. That’s absolutely amazing, and it’s allowed us to pay for even more transcripts. We’re very, very close to having all of Season 2 transcribed. Check out our website to see the transcripts we finished so far.
One quick note about this pair of episodes. I meant to include this in the intro of last episode, but I completely blanked on it, so I’m making up for it today. These two episodes center around the Red Lamp, a legal brothel in Duskwall. I have always tried to run this game as one that is positive towards a whole vast array of experiences with sex, gender and attraction. For the Red Lamp I did some research into legal brothels and read articles written by women who work at them. My hope is that, even if there are some inaccuracies, this has been at least a respectful portrayal. Sex work is real and legitimate work, and sex workers deserve respect, support, protection and payment.
Next, I’m going to talk about this month’s Featured Charity:
My Featured Charity this month is your local food bank. With millions of people suddenly unemployed food banks have become a critical way for people to feed themselves and their families, and donating money is a much better option than donating food, because food banks have agreements with wholesalers and grocers to buy food at extremely low prices, meaning they can stretch a dollar a lot farther than you can.
If you do want to donate something tangible, consider things like diapers, formula, toothpaste, menstrual products, toilet paper, or pantry staples like cooking oil or spices. Many of these things aren’t covered by food stamps, and so many recipes rely on you having basic ingredients that not everyone can afford to keep stocked. This month I donated to the Greater Chicago Food Depository, but look for food banks in your area and see what you can do to support them.
If you’re in the United States, contact your elected officials about saving the post office. The post office is absolutely critical to the infrastructure of the United States with millions depending on its inexpensive, reliable mail delivery, and somehow we have ended up in a place where it might collapse in a few months. So call, send messages, demand that the next relief bill through Congress includes the full funding that the post office needs. In addition, contact your state officials about universal mail-in ballots for the general election in November. This pandemic isn’t likely to go away any time soon, and we need to be prepared for a socially distant election. Mail-in ballots must be provided to everyone so no one has to choose between their right to vote and their health.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:03:24]
Minna (as Myra): So we’ve been looking for her for a while, and it turns out that your employer is that remaining member, which obviously means you’ve been in a lot more danger than we realized up until now.
Rhi: Nyryx is frowning really intensely and sits down on the edge of the bed, kind of twisting her hands together.
Rhi (as Nyryx): She’s always been so good to us, to me, to everybody here. Are you certain?
Minna (as Myra): Pretty sure, yeah. We’ve got some friends who have been doing research into this for gotta be months now and I trust their research.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Where’s Minx? Why isn’t she the one here? Why are you here?
Minna (as Myra): Because Minx has a job to do.
Rhi: Nyryx… her expression kind of goes through a bit of a journey. There’s a lot of little micro expressions that you can’t entirely read, because you don’t know her that well. Minx probably would be able to recognize the warning signs here, but Myra, I’m not sure that you necessarily do.
Minna: [nervous, uneasy noise]
Rhi: Actually, I’m gonna have you make a resistance roll.
Minna: I was gonna say, I’m…
Rhi: Yeah. Roll me an Insight here.
Minna: It seems reasonable for her to put her hands up here and try to stop her.
Rhi: Well, what happens here is she kind of goes on this face journey and then is like…
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, since we’re gonna be here for a while, do you want a drink?
Rhi: …and goes over to the little mini bar to start pouring you something.
Minna: That’s a 5, so I’m gonna take 1 stress?
Rhi: Yeah, then you will take the 1 point of stress, and Nyryx will come over and will offer you a drink. She has a glass in her hand.
Minna: I think Myra sets it aside and reaches up. She doesn’t touch her, because she doesn’t want to startle her worse or touch her without her wanting her to, but she just kind of has her hands up in a very placating gesture.
Minna (as Myra): Minx cannot be stopped right now. It’s going to be safest for everybody if you just stay here with me.
Rhi: She looks down at the glass that you did not drink out of, sets her glass aside, and just looks you square in the eyes.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I have known Minx since I was eight. I know what she can be like, and I appreciate that she wants to keep me safe, but it is my life, and she is my partner, and I am not going to be held prisoner here.
Rhi: She darts across the room and kinda flips a curtain aside and you can see that she has a hand on the security—like, there’s a lever there that you’re guessing is gonna summon the security, and she hasn’t pulled it but she’s basically just looking at you.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Are you going to let me go or am I going to have to have you removed?
Minna (as Myra): If you pull that then it is very probable that Minx, and Blaire, and possibly I will all die tonight. Do you want that?
Rhi (as Nyryx): I trust that you, and Minx and Blaire, are good enough at what you do to make sure that doesn’t happen.
Minna: I think that Myra maybe will go to physically pull her away from the alarm.
Rhi: Okay. Nyryx, as you close in, her hand shifts. She lets go of the lever and she comes out with something in her hand that she basically throws in your face, and it is a very fine, familiar powder.
Minna: [delighted] Trance powder to the face.
Josie: [laughs and claps]
Rhi: Minx accidentally—Yeah, I mean, listen. I feel like all of them did this.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: Or Minx got it from Nyryx, learned that trick from her. But yeah, she hits you square in the face with it.
Minna: Failed to poison me once. Did not fail the second time.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: [chuckles]
Minna: This is the second time she’s been trance powdered!
Rhi: Yeah. The first time was an accident, but yeah. The first time it happened it was kind of an indirect, you got hit with sort of the… What is the word I’m looking for?
Minna: Shrapnel…?
Rhi: Yeah, more or less. You were the collateral damage. This is directly targeted at you, a full dose straight to the face.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Kim: Oof.
Rhi: Yeah, so… do you wanna resist?
Minna: No.
Rhi: You kinda start to fall, and Nyryx catches you and sort of leads you over to the couch and gets you laying down, and just sort of looks down at you.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I’ll make sure you get out of here. Just stay put, okay?
Rhi: Then she leaves, and before you space out completely you hear the door lock from the outside locking you in. Let’s cut back upstairs.
Minna: [whispering, frantically] Why do the doors lock from the outside?! I don’t like that.
Josie: Imagine there’s just a key.
Rhi: Yeah, they lock from both sides.
Minna: Oh, okay.
Rhi: It’s basically—because this is like, that’s her…
Minna: Ahh.
Rhi: And she, you know, wants to be able to lock it when she leaves.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. They lock from both sides. So, back upstairs. Blaire and Minx, you are right outside the door to the employee lounge area. People may be in there. [chuckles]
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: How do you want to proceed here?
Josie: Can we listen at the door and try to hear anyone?
Rhi: Yeah. You can do probably a Study or a Survey, whichever one.
Josie: It’s all the same to me.
Rhi: Then go ahead and make that roll. Still risky.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: I think you listen really, really hard for a solid minute just with your ear pressed to this door, and all you can hear is the distant sound of a shower starting up and water running, so it sounds like probably not a lot of people in there and whoever is in there it sounds like just got into the shower so not necessarily gonna be out to see you. However, because you spend a good amount of time verifying that it’s empty, we’re gonna tick up that clock.
Josie: Okie-dokie.
Rhi: But yeah, you crack open the door. This is the employee lounge area. There’s kind of a central living room type setup with some couches and armchairs, some bookshelves. There’s some little what look like private nooks that have curtains hanging over them. There’s a little kitchenette area. It’s all very nice, it looks very comfy, nice relaxing space. Then, as you move in here and close the door behind you, there’s a hall that heads off and you can hear the running water from down that way, but nobody appears to be in here right now.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You have a little bit of leeway to keep looking for that fourth floor access.
Josie: Yeah, I mean, I wanna keep looking.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Go ahead and make a roll. If you wanna do this as a group thing again…
Josie: Well, I got a 2, so…
Kim: Ooh. Okay, let’s make this a group thing!
[laughter]
Rhi: Who’s gonna lead?
Kim: Me.
Josie: Okay.
Kim: Five?
Josie: Thank you, Kim, for saving my ass the whole way up here.
Kim: You’re welcome.
Rhi: So Blaire, you’re gonna take another point of stress. How are you doing on stress, by the way?
Kim: I have 5 to spare.
Rhi: Oh okay. So yeah, you both fan out and kind of look around. Blaire, you’re the one that finds it. Down the hall, you check a couple of the doors and it’s just storage, like towels and bars of soap and linen closets, and as you’re turning away you notice in one of the wall panels there’s just a little bit of light coming out from a little crack in the wall.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And you kind of pat at it and press on the panel and then it kinda cracks open. You have located a secret door, on the other side of which are stairs going up.
Kim: Ooh.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: But you did get a 5, so there is a consequence. I think I’m just gonna tick the clock up again.
Kim: [uncomfortable] Okay.
Rhi: So you’re at 3 out of 4 on security being alerted, but you found stairs heading up.
Josie: [grinning] Let’s go.
Rhi: All right, up the stairs you go. At the top of the stairs, it’s a secret passage but it’s still very nice. [laughs] The walls are painted, there’s a couple pictures hanging on them, there’s carpet on the stairs, and at the top is a heavy door that is painted red with some gold detailing on it. It’s a very fancy door.
Josie: So what you’re saying is we see a red door.
Rhi: … Yes.
Josie: And yeah, I do kinda want to paint it black.
Rhi: [amused] I actually rephrased, because I was about to say “you see a red door.” No! I’m not gonna make it that easy on them.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And then you got there anyway.
Josie: Making us work for it.
Rhi: So yeah, you’ve got this door in front of you. If you try the doorknob, it is unsurprisingly locked.
Josie: [sighs] I cannot really do lock picking.
Kim: I can kind of do lock picking.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: You know what, I’ll push myself.
Rhi: Okay. All right. This is gonna be risky, reduced effect, because she has really good security on her home.
Kim: Okay. Ouch!
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: Ooh, that’s not a good sign.
Kim: A 1 and a 3.
Rhi: Oof!
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, you start working at the lock. It’s a tough lock. This is a very complicated door. As you’re working on it, you hear a click, and for a second you’re like huh, got it, and then something pricks into your wrist…
Kim: [gasps]
Josie: Oh no!
Rhi: …as a little poison needle has just shot out from a plate under the doorknob. You look down, and yeah, there’s a little needle…
Kim: I can’t believe my ex would do me like this.
Rhi: [laughs] …stuck in your arm.
Kim: [squirms]
Rhi: So, you’re gonna take level 2 harm, Poisoned, unless you want to resist that.
Kim: I do. What do I need to roll to resist?
Rhi: It’s gonna be Prowess.
Kim: Okay great. Two, three, six.
Rhi: Six, okay!
Josie: Phew.
Rhi: You’re able to resist it. It’s gonna drop it down to one. I think that you’re able to yank the needle out fast enough that you don’t get a big dose, but you still, like, you’re starting to feel a little shaky.
Kim: [uneasy grunt]
Rhi: A little shaky, a little woozy, your vision is swimming a little bit, you kinda have to work to focus. You’re gonna be at reduced effect on stuff that takes concentration, basically, so Tinker, Attune, Study, things like that.
Kim (as Blaire): [weakly] She really didn’t skimp out on the good stuff, huh?
Josie (as Minx): No she didn’t. Are you all right?
Kim (as Blaire): [groans] Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Should I take a turn at the door?
Kim (as Blaire): No. No, you shouldn’t. If this thing gets both of us that’ll be bad.
Josie (as Minx): Well, I wasn’t gonna go for picking it.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you sure?
Josie (as Minx): It is up to you what you want to do. You’re the one who just got stabbed.
Kim (as Blaire): Eh… pricked.
Josie (as Minx): You know what I mean.
Kim (as Blaire): [exhales] Blow it open. Whatever.
Josie: [laughing] All right then.
Rhi: All right Minx, you’re up. What are you gonna do?
Josie: Minx is gonna go for a Wreck.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I don’t think it’s an explosion, I just think Minx has a fucking sledgehammer.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Oh, so she’s just going Harley Quinn on this.
Josie: I have a heavy load.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yes. Like, I’m gonna mark that as demolition tools, but… [laughs]
Rhi: Go ahead and Wreck it. So, your effect is gonna be standard. I feel like this is gonna be desperate, and my reasoning on it is that you’re abandoning subtlety. She’s gonna know you’re coming. This is probably gonna trip some other alarms.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Does that make sense to you?
Josie: Yeah, that makes sense.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: And I’ll mark xp about it.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Got a 6.
Rhi: Yeah! Narrate this smashing down a door for me.
Josie: She takes her time. She’s not really an athlete, but she slowly practices her arc a little bit, and then just FWAM!
Rhi: Yeah, you wanna get this done in one shot.
Josie: Exactly.
Rhi: Which you do. I think that, yeah, you practice, you line it up, and just slam straight through the doorknob and the locking mechanism and it flies open. You see a very nicely appointed parlor, dimly lit at the moment, nobody’s in there. There’s a couple hallways branching off. There’s an archway that leads to what looks like a dining room area. You don’t see anyone in the dining room. So, you’ve got two doors and two halls that you can explore.
Josie: But no guards, so far.
Rhi: No.
Josie: I’m gonna go down one of the hallways looking for a bedroom.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire, what are you doing?
Kim: Probably go the opposite way of Minx just to cover more ground.
Rhi: Okay. So you’re both heading off down opposite hallways. I kinda wanna check back in with Myra.
Minna: They’re not… Are they struggling? Are they gonna need help?
Rhi: They’re gonna shortly.
Minna: Uh-huh… Okay.
Josie: [smiling nervously] Oh boy.
Minna: I think there’s a slight sound and every one of her fight or flight instincts activate at once. Kind of the way you’re starting to have a bad dream so you’re like okay, time to wake up, that’s how she gets up off the couch.
Rhi: Jerk out of it? Yeah.
Minna: Yeah, just by plain willpower.
Rhi: The door is locked. [laughs] When you rush to the door and you try the door, it is locked.
Minna: I don’t think I’m good at picking locks.
Rhi: Yeah, that would be Tinker.
Minna: Yeah, I have 0 dots in that.
Rhi: There is a window in here.
Minna: Mmm, I’m gonna do that.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Climb out the window and see if there’s a room I can climb into that’s open.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Give me a…
Minna: I think it’s a Prowl.
Rhi: it’s definitely Prowl. I’m trying to decide on the position. I think it’s risky, just because there are guards around, you’re climbing on the outside of a building, and you’re still a little woozy.
Minna: This is just like a person who’s slightly drunk deciding to climb out a window. It could end poorly.
Rhi: Yeah. You’re gonna be risky position, standard effect, climbing out a window.
Minna: I think I’m going to push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay…
Josie: Five ain’t bad.
Rhi: So, I think that you are able to scramble up the side of the building. There’s pipes. There’s window ledges. You make it up to… I think that you actually end up climbing into the lounge area. You climb into an empty space. However, we’re gonna fill up that clock. Security has been alerted that there are some kind of intruders on the third floor.
Minna: I guess climbing in a window was not my smartest move knowing there’s a security system.
Rhi: [laughing] Listen, Nyryx didn’t leave you a lot of options. You’re up there, and while that’s all happening we’ll cut back upstairs. Blaire, go ahead and give me a roll to search the hallway that you’re in.
Kim: You know what, I haven’t rolled an Attune yet this session. I’m gonna do that.
Rhi: You haven’t. Yeah. This is gonna be risky, and you’re using your spirit mask?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, so risky, greater effect.
Kim: Two, three, four.
Rhi: I think, actually, so here’s what it’s gonna be.
Kim: Mm-hmm?
Rhi: You put on your spirit mask, you attune to the ghost field, and you see, behind a door, this room that is just glowing with arcane and occult energies, and kind of on instinct you make your way over and you push at the door and it’s not locked. You go inside, and it is this, like, it’s honestly kind of… You’re sort of in awe. This is kind of a masterpiece of wards and summonings and bindings. There are thee glowing runes that are connected in ways that you haven’t seen before. There are shelves with glass fronts that contain all kinds of occult artifacts. There’s like books, these thick leather-bound tomes that you can just tell are full of arcane knowledge. You live for this shit.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: This is exactly your jam, and if you want to resist giving into your vice and just forgetting about Minx and forgetting about Myra and forgetting about Nyryx and forget about everything, and just dive into this room, you’re gonna need to make a roll. You’ll need to make a resistance roll.
Kim: [groans] Here’s the thing, and this is very selfish of me, but I get xp if I give into this. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: But at the same time, Blaire’s already on thin fucking ice when it comes to her own self-interests versus the crew.
Rhi: Mm-hmm!
Josie: I mean, you can make the resistance roll later?
Rhi: Yeah, you could do that, same thing that Myra did where you can kinda start to get into this and then pull yourself out in a little bit if you want.
Kim: We’ll do that!
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I think Blaire just gets, you know, she gets very wide-eyed and takes off her spirit mask, and I think the camera just focuses on her hand reaching for her journal and then we cut away.
Rhi: Yeah, I love that. Okay, so Blaire is just like, she’s just walked into a treasure trove.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh fuck yeah…
[laughter]
Rhi: Minx?
Josie: Minx is just kind of striding down the hallway. Pretty normal for bedrooms to be at the end. She’s kind of resisting tapping the sledgehammer on the floor like her cane, and I think she’s drawn her sword in the other hand. She’s not being very thorough, she’s just kind of going for the end and if that’s not it she’ll work her way back.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead and give me a roll for searching this end of the hall.
Josie: That’s a 3.
Rhi: So, you follow your gut, you stride to the end of the hallway, you throw open the door at the end there… it is the bedroom. It’s a nice bedroom, four-poster bed, this vanity that’s just laden with jewelry and makeup, big standing wardrobe. It’s empty. It’s dark. The bed is neatly made, nobody’s in it.
Josie: Minx kinda double-takes at the jewelry before forcing herself back into kill mode and turning around to keep looking.
Rhi: Yeah, like whoa. [laughs] You turn around and start checking the other doors. The first one you open is a bathroom. Nobody’s in there. You open the second one and you have a split second impression of a brightly lit study: nice big desk, couch and a couple armchairs. It’s that setup where there’s the desk and then there’s shelves behind it with all kinds of books and other things on top of it. You kind of have a split second to take this in and also Madam Tesslyn sitting behind the desk and then she fires the gun at you.
Josie: Oh boy!
Kim: Oh… oh… oh.
Rhi: Yeah. You are going to take level 2 harm as you get shot.
Josie: I’m going to mark armor.
Rhi: Okay, so that’ll drop it down to level 1. It goes from being you get shot in the torso to you get bruised badly in the torso.
Josie: I think I’m gonna try and resist it also. Can I do that?
Rhi: Yeah. I’ll allow it. That’ll be Prowess.
Josie: Very good at {that}.
Rhi: Six, okay, yeah. You just shake it off.
Josie: Yeah. I take the room in for a second and then fucking duck back behind the door and it sort of grazes Minx’s shoulder plate, essentially. She has a dueling pauldron on.
Rhi: Okay. I think, Blaire, you hear that gunshot.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Gunshots are not subtle things.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Myra, you hear a gunshot too, and I think you hear it just as you get into the lounge. So, Blaire, if you wanna make that resistance roll now…?
Kim: Yes. Is this going to be Resolve?
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: Okay: 4, 5, 3, 6.
Rhi: Okay, 6. So yeah, you snap out of it, drop whatever book you’re holding. Back to Minx. You’ve just been shot at, you duck out of the way, and you can hear the sound of the pistol being quickly reloaded.
Rhi (as Tesslyn): She was perfectly safe, you know. I always liked her. I wasn’t going to do anything until you forced my hand.
Minna: Oh no.
Josie (as Minx): No one’s safe around people like you.
Josie: Minx is going to toss, lightly, the sledgehammer into the room to try and fake her out, to get her to shoot again, and then charge in afterward.
Rhi: Okay. I feel like that’s a Sway, because you’re trying to bluff her.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I’m also good at those, another 6.
Rhi: Ooh, but just barely. The rest of that sucked. [laughs]
Josie: Uh-huh. [laughs] Sure did.
Rhi: Yeah, so that would have been risky-standard again. Yeah, so you throw the sledgehammer, gun goes off again, and you can charge into the room. The gun fires and then just:
Rhi (as Tesslyn): Shit!
Josie: Yep. I’m gonna just charge right at her.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I’ll go over the desk if I need to.
Rhi: Well, let’s see how this roll goes.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, I feel like your options here are Skirmish or Wreck.
Josie: I feel like Wreck is thematic for this first part, because I think I just want to go over the desk and then pin her to the wall.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, this is gonna be risky, since you eliminated the option of her shooting at you as you come through the door, and standard effect.
Josie: I’m thinking about pushing myself, but I would be remiss if I didn’t ask after a Devil’s Bargain here.
Rhi: All right. Minx is going to end up with a scar that she can’t hide.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim: Ooh…
Josie: I… I have to.
[laughter]
Josie: That’s so sexy.
[giggling]
Josie: That’s so sexy and poignant. I’m taking that.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: I am doing it.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, you’ve got that Devil’s Bargain.
Josie: All right, I got a 5.
Rhi: Yeah. Like you said, you rush into the room, she is halfway through reloading the pistol, sees you coming, throws it aside and grabs something up off her desk. You go over the desk and grab her. There’s a struggle. Are you trying to just pin her to the wall with your hands, or are you using a sword? How are you approaching?
Josie: Well, I wanna pin her to the wall with my hands so I can then pin her to the wall through the heart with a sword. That’s my end goal. [chuckles]
Rhi: Got it. So yeah, she’s putting up a fight. You, I think, underestimated her physical capabilities, and what she grabbed off the desk was a letter opener, and she, in the middle of this struggle, gets you across the face. We will determine exactly where the scar ends up later, but right now it’s just there’s a lot of blood across Minx’s face. I think it’s kinda dripping into your eye. You manage to knock the letter opener aside and get her pinned. She hisses something under her breath, and there’s this electric feeling in the air, and both her hands start crackling with electroplasmic energy.
Kim: Uh-oh.
Josie: Right, she is a Whisper, she can do that.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. You are gonna be in a… I think it’s a desperate position, because basically if you fuck up this next roll she’s gonna zap the hell out of you.
Josie: I’m gonna push myself on this Skirmish.
Rhi: Desperate, standard effect.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: How do you do it?
Josie: Minx just… I wanna know what look she has in her eyes.
Rhi: She’s furious. She’s angry.
Josie: All right, then I think Minx, with no hesitation, just presses her sword right through her heart and into the wood behind her.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that she had been just about to release this blast on you, and then you run her through, and the electricity just kind of crackles out into the air harmlessly. She screams, because she’s just been stabbed in the heart, and blood gushes out over both of you, and then there’s this long silent moment… and then from behind you, you hear:
Rhi (as Nyryx): [shakily] Minx?
Minna: [breathy] No!
Josie: Minx wheels around and finally lets go of the sword.
Rhi: Nyryx is standing in the doorway, eyes wide. She’s dressed as she would be for work. She looks beautiful.
Josie: [pained] Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You can hear—I don’t know if Minx can hear this, she might not notice, but Myra and Blaire both sprint down the hall towards Nyryx who’s just frozen in the doorway, and Minx is just covered in blood.
Kim: Oh Jesus.
Josie: Minx… A corner of Minx’s mouth kind of turns up in a semi-smile, but it’s clearly one of those I am frantic and not okay sort of things.
Minna: [as a groan] Aww…
Rhi: Yeah. You smile because you’re seeing the person that you love and you’re happy to see her and everything else is just kinda like, you don’t have the control to keep it from happening right now.
Josie: Yeah. She’s just like:
Josie (as Minx): Nyrie, you’re okay. Good.
Rhi: Nyryx takes a step back into the hall, and she looks scared.
Josie: Then I think Minx kind of looks down and takes stock of herself and just kinda walks over to one of the walls and slides down it into a sitting position. She’s really, really tired.
Rhi: Nyryx is frozen like a step back into the hallway as, Blaire and Myra, you both kinda get there. What are you two gonna do?
Kim: Well, if Tesslyn’s dead there’s—I think Blaire’s gotta have to work on capturing the spirit so that way, you know, they don’t have another problem on their hands.
Minna: [breathy] Yeah…
Rhi: Shit… uh, you’re right. Yeah.
Josie: Good call.
Rhi: Yeah. So Blaire, you’re gonna run over to the body and start dealing with that?
Kim: [tightly] Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Should I roll an Attune to try and jar her up?
Rhi: Yeah. It’s gonna be… Normally spirits don’t leave the body right away.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So, I think you’re gonna be at reduced effect… Well, no, because you’ll be using your spirit mask, and you’ve got a jar. I don’t think the spirit jars are fine spirit jars necessarily, but your spirit mask will help, so that’s gonna push it up to standard effect, risky position.
Kim: Great.
Rhi: I do want to remind, I think that, Myra, you’re kind of the last one up here. You heard running footsteps coming up the hall behind you as you were making your way up here. Like, the guards are on their way.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: So, Blaire, go ahead and make your roll.
Kim: Three, three, five.
Rhi: Five, okay. You get—What I’m gonna go with is you’re able to get the spirit out of the body, but it flees before you’re able to get her into a jar.
Kim: Yeesh. All right, you know what, as long as it’s out of here. We’ll deal with that later.
Rhi: [laughing] That’s a problem for future Blaire.
Kim: Yup.
Josie: [uneasy] Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay, so Blaire’s doing that, Minx is sitting on the floor covered in blood, Nyryx is standing frozen in the hallway in horror. Myra?
Minna: Yeah, I think she stops to glance at Nyryx.
Rhi: Nyryx does not notice you.
Minna: Yeah, and then just kinda leaves her there and says:
Minna (as Myra): We need to get out of here fast. There are people coming.
Josie (as Minx): [weakly] Yeah… Nyryx should get out of here too. We should leave.
Josie: Minx kind of slowly inches herself up the wall.
Rhi: You leave some blood streaks behind. Like, using your hands on the wall you leave some bloody handprints.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Lucky for you, forensics isn’t a thing. [laughs]
Kim: Yep.
Josie: Yeah. She’s gonna slowly make her way towards the door.
Rhi: Nyryx kinda moves out of the way.
Josie (as Minx): Are you staying?
Rhi: I think she looks at you for a long, long moment, and there is fear and heartbreak in her eyes, but she swallows hard and kinda clenches her jaw and says:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Go out the window. I’ll tell them that I found her like this and I saw someone running away.
Josie (as Minx): Nyryx, please—
Rhi (as Nyryx): [forcefully] Go!
Josie (as Minx): Please be okay.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [shouting] Just go!
Josie: Minx takes a moment but doesn’t say anything before heading out.
Rhi: There are windows in this study. You’re able to climb down to safety and head off into the night.
## Downtime [0:32:24]
Rhi: You all make it out, you make it back to The Nest, and let’s do our downtime things. How… Hmm. When does Minx head out?
Josie: I think it’s a good long while.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: She’s spends a lot of time showering…
Rhi: Oof, yeah.
Josie: …making sure everything’s clean, and then she’s in her room just quietly for a long time.
Rhi: You all did this… you probably, you know, if Myra’s appointment was at 2, so you all got there at about 2 in the morning, I would imagine it’s probably edging on towards dawn by the time you all get home.
Kim & Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So maybe it’s the following evening. Does that sound about right?
Josie: Sounds about right.
Rhi: Yeah. So Minx slips out and we’ll follow her later. Blaire and Myra, what do you two do back in The Nest?
Kim: We’re probably both in the common room I would think.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Hex is sitting on Blaire’s lap.
Kim: Yep, on the couch.
Rhi: Purring up a storm.
Kim (as Blaire): I let her get away.
Minna (as Myra): That’s… There’s only so much we could have done to control the situation.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, but now we have that to deal with.
Minna (as Myra): We will deal with it then. Sorry, I… this was never going to go smoothly, was it?
Kim (as Blaire): No. No, it wasn’t.
Minna (as Myra): We rushed into it.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, believe it or not, it’s… you know, we could have rushed more into it.
Minna (as Myra): We certainly could have. I know some of us were fit to run directly off. I just don’t know how it’s gonna turn out.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think Nyryx is gonna be okay?
Minna (as Myra): [exhales] I don’t know. The way she was looking at Minx, it worries me, but on the other hand I think she’s tougher than any of us give her credit for, really.
Kim (as Blaire): And they’ve known each other since they were kids. I don’t know… She might come around.
Minna (as Myra): She might. Are you gonna be okay?
Kim (as Blaire): Huh? Me? Yeah. Yeah, I’ll be fine. I mean, we took down another Circle member. That’s what we came for.
Minna (as Myra): Mm-hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): So yeah, I’m okay. What about you?
Minna (as Myra): I’m okay, I just… it’s not… These jobs aren’t easy, I’m trying to make my peace with them, but it still feels strange. Trying to explain to Nyryx and keep her in that place just kinda drove home how this is the life we’re living now.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, yeah, and it is what we signed up for, so… you know.
Minna (as Myra): It just feels so much colder somehow planning it like this.
Kim (as Blaire): It needed to happen.
Minna (as Myra): I never killed anyone before I met you guys…
Kim (as Blaire): I would hope—
Minna (as Myra): Not to blame any of you for it, just… I guess I never cared about anything enough to kill.
Kim (as Blaire): I would have hoped that you hadn’t killed anyone before you met us, because it would be fucked up.
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): You don’t know what kind of life any of us might have lived.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, I didn’t do great stuff either, but you know, I didn’t kill anyone before joining the crew either, so I get it.
Minna (as Myra): Do you wanna know something funny?
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Minna (as Myra): She got me with trance powder. Nyryx.
Kim (as Blaire): [laughs] For real?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, completely in the style of Minx, so now I know what it feels like.
Kim (as Blaire): How was it?
Minna (as Myra): Hmm. I’d prefer that not happen to me again, frankly. Twice is too many.
Kim (as Blaire): Fair.
Kim: I think what Blaire does next is she kind of scoops up Hex in that very undignified cat way where the arms are sticking out.
Minna: [delighted] yes.
Kim (as Blaire): You want a kitty?
Minna (as Myra): I would love a kitty.
[giggling]
Minna (as Myra): Hello you strange little creature, you.
Kim: Hex is just squirming.
Rhi: [makes angry meowing sounds] Hex kind of, you know, does—
Minna: She definitely does the thing where she kisses the top of the cat’s head and kind of insults it.
Rhi: [chuckles] He’s just doing that cat that was just woken up and is being moved about grumble.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: But as soon as Myra sets him down on her lap he kind of shifts around and turns in circles and then settles down back into a little Hex ball.
Minna (as Myra): Who’s a sweet little monster?
Rhi: He’s purring very loudly.
Minna (as Myra): Yes you are.
Kim (as Blaire): Who’s my good little abomination?
[laughter]
Rhi: So, we leave the two of them…
Kim (as Blaire): The cutest crime against nature.
Rhi:. …gently and affectionately insulting this bat cat, and we catch up to Minx.
Josie: Now that she’s cleaned up, what’s her scar?
Rhi: Yeah. I was gonna ask. I mean, I’m gonna leave that in your hands.
Josie: If it’s up to me, I have to do the sexy over-eye scar. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I’m down with that, although I think that means at this point, because it’s so fresh, I mean it’s not a scar at this point…
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, are you thinking like the full, all the way down, bisects the eyebrow and then kind of continues under the eye?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: I think that she’s got some stitches and probably some bandages above and below the eye. I don’t think that it’s a full, like, you don’t have to have that eye covered, but I think it’s definitely swollen and bruised. It looks like you got kind of a black eye around there. So, it is not a sexy scar yet. [laughs]
Josie: Yes, with time. Give it time, dears.
Rhi: Yeah. Right now, you know, you look like you got slashed across the face 12 hours ago.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Rhi: Yeah. But yeah, what’s she look like, how is she dressed?
Josie: She’s not dressed how she was, but her hair is still down. In fact, she kind of has it side swept a little bit to help cover up the bandages a little bit. She’s definitely in Minx clothes but very, very casual.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: And her collar is slightly unbuttoned, and she’s in general looking very tired.
Rhi: Yeah… Yeah. Spent a lot of time in her room but probably didn’t really sleep.
Josie: Mm-hmm. No makeup or anything.
Rhi: Yeah. I assume you’re showing up at Nyryx’s apartment?
Josie: Mm-hmm. I think she goes to knock like three times before actually knocking.
Rhi: Yeah… There’s a bit of a pause, and then Nyryx opens the door and just kinda looks you up and down, and then silently steps aside so that you can come in.
Josie: Minx goes in. She kinda looks like… She very much looks ashamed.
Rhi: Yeah, just very guilty.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: So yeah, she shuts the door behind you and closes, locks the door, and I think sits down on the couch and gestures for you to sit down too.
Josie: Minx does.
Rhi: I think Nyryx kinda, like, she does that thing where she takes a breath to speak and then stops and sits there for a minute, clearly trying to collect her thoughts, and then she finally says:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Myra, um… Myra told me why you thought you had to do it, and I don’t… I don’t doubt that you thought it was necessary, but I know there’s a lot you don’t tell me, and I know that it’s because you’re trying to protect me… and I kinda liked it, you know? Having my knight in shining armor.
Josie: [small emotional noise]
Rhi (as Nyryx): But I don’t think it’s helping anymore, and I think you need to tell me, because Minx, it’s not that you killed her. [exhales] There were things that she said, rumors about some of the things that she did, and you’re not a bad person. You wouldn’t have killed her if you didn’t believe it was the right thing to do, but the look on your face…
Josie (as Minx): I… I can share more with you. I can do that, but I just really didn’t want you to get hurt.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I know.
Josie (as Minx): You wanted out, and really I should have gotten out too, rather than trying to play keep-away. I don’t think it was the right thing. I think it was the necessary thing. We’ve been trying to figure out another way to do this, but we can’t.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Are you sure? You… I remember what it was like when we were kids and you and Bazso were always the ones with the blades and I was the one with the smiles distracting the marks.
Josie (as Minx): Heh…
Rhi (as Nyryx): And Bazso was always okay with it, but it always ate away at you.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah…
Rhi (as Nyryx): And you didn’t wanna be like that.
Josie (as Minx): I still don’t.
Rhi: I’m imagining that you two initially were kind of sitting on opposite ends of the couch, and I think she scoots over to your side of the couch and puts an arm around your shoulders.
Josie: Minx actually seems kind of surprised.
Rhi (as Nyryx): You don’t have to be. You’ve got choices still.
Josie (as Minx): What choices? If we leave that they’ll hurt who knows how many people, but then people we care about are in danger. I could leave, I could still do that, but I don’t know a way to stay in this life and have choices.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Have you killed all of them? All the people you’ve gone after.
Josie (as Minx): It hasn’t always been me, but most of them.
Rhi (as Nyryx): But not all. There’s other ways.
Josie (as Minx): How…? With other people, sure, but Circle of Flame… they’re relentless.
Rhi: She very, very gently, being careful to not touch the fresh stitches on your face, tucks your hair back and says:
Josie: Aw…
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t doubt that, just based on the little bits that I’ve gotten and been able to put together, but I don’t want you to fight them so hard that you lose all of the things that make you ‘you.’
Josie (as Minx): But they keep coming after people I love, the people we love.
Rhi: I think she keeps her one arm around your shoulder and then with her other hand she takes one of yours and says:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Tell me what we’re up against so that I can take care of myself.
Josie (as Minx): Are you sure?
Rhi: She just nods.
Josie (as Minx): I can do that, I think.
Rhi: What I’m picturing is Minx starting to talk, to explain everything, as we kinda pull back through the window and just leave the two of them, sitting together, hand in hand on the couch.
Josie: [as a whine] Aww!
Rhi: I think that’s where we’ll leave it.
Minna: [emotional hum]
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: You good? [chuckles]
Josie: Uh-huh~ [chuckles]

"Season 3, Episode 16: The Loyal Fans Score Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter)
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. We’re getting close to the end of Season 3. It is amazing how much this show has grown from my earliest plans for it and it means a lot to me and the rest of the cast to have all of you supporting us. Things that also mean a lot to us, reviews! We love reviews and we got some really lovely ones last month. If you like the show, please tell us and any other potential listeners about it by leaving a review on your podcast listener of choice.
A quick note about this episode. Josie was unable to join us for recording, so there’s no Minx in this one. Never fear, The Magpies’ most fashionable member will be back next episode.
Also, in case you missed it on our Twitter, I was a recent guest on Party of One Podcast. If you’re not familiar with it, Party of One is an actual play show in which host Jeff Stormer plays through games with a single player, usually himself, and a guest GM. Sometimes the games are designed for two players, and sometimes it’s more of an experiment to see how games that are meant for groups handle just a single player. One-player Blades in the Dark works really well, and I had an absolute blast running this game for Jeff. It ended up also being about being gay and doing crimes. You can find a link to the episode in the show notes.
Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s call to action.
Josie: Hey, coronavirus sucks. Donate PPE to people and institutions that need them, and also money. Uh, support people where you live, maybe organize a rent strike or something. If you can do it, stay inside.
Rhi: I also don’t really have a lot new to say here. I think everybody knows what we’re all going through, what actions we need to take to help each other. Support the Post Office, fight for protections for essential workers, keep fighting for a better world.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [00.02.18]
Rhi: We open up in Charhollow on a quiet residential street. There’s a lot of kind of run-down apartment buildings, a little worn, paint is chipping, things like that. The streets look like they probably haven’t been swept in a few weeks. And in the midst of this street there is a house. It is a large house, clearly very newly built. It doesn’t have the sort of coaldust grime on it that most buildings in Charhollow and Coalridge seem to acquire after a little bit of time. It’s much, much nicer than any of the buildings around it and it is surrounded by a tall wrought iron fence.
And we can see through the fence a figure moving towards the house. They’ve got a hood up, a coat on that kind of disguises what they look like. And this person gets up towards the house and reaches into the satchel at their side and pulls out a bottle. They open it up and start pouring out the liquid that’s inside, and it’s some kind of oil that they’re splashing on the wall of the house. And they do that with a couple more bottles, circling the house, splashing oil on the walls. And then they pull out a fourth bottle that is a bottle of a cheap Skovlan vodka that has a rag stuffed in the top. And the person takes out a matchbook, strikes a match, lights the rag and then, once it’s caught, they hurl the bottle at the wall of the house, and it bursts in a flash of flame which catches the oil that’s on the side of the house.
And very quickly, the house starts burning. And the person stands there for a minute, watching as the flames catch and start taking the house, and then they reach into their pocket and flick something through the air towards the flames. And we see as this thing kinda tumbles through the air that it is a Magpie pin.
We cut to Blaire and Myra, who we find at The Hound’s Paw at their usual table. It’s been not too long since the incident at The Red Lamp when The Magpies went after and assassinated Madame Tesslyn, the former owner of The Red Lamp brothel and a member of The Circle of Flame. Minx has been keeping— all of The Magpies have been keeping a low profile, but Minx especially so. And right now, she is continuing to lay low at The Nest and recover from her various injuries. So, Blaire and Myra, what are the two of you doing here at The Hound’s Paw on this kind of quiet afternoon?
Minna: Myra and Blaire are playing cards at the table.
Rhi: Nice. Yeah, so I think it’s kind of getting— starting to get back into that old routine you had where, you know, you would hang out at The Hound’s Paw and wait around for a little bit to see if anybody came in who needed your particular services. Rigney’s at the bar, as usual. Not cleaning glasses for once. He is just hanging out there and updating the— I think he’s updating the staff schedule for the next month, getting all the shifts worked out.
Kim: The next month?
Rhi: He’s a very— listen. You get a predictable schedule from Rigney. He is a good boss.
Kim: Thank God.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Because when I worked retail, I never got more than a week’s notice.
Rhi: I know. Rigney is a good boss!
Kim: Thank you.
Rhi: He pays well, and you know your schedule a month in advance. [laughs]
Minna: That’s amazing.
Kim: My God, the bar is in Hell, and yet…
Rhi: Yep. So, there’s a lot of sort of muttered grumbling and erasing as he’s trying to, you know, get this schedule to work out, but he’s working on it. And as you’re hanging out here, the door opens and familiar figures come in. It is Briggs, Minx’s and really now kind of The Magpies’ contact in Charhollow, and he is accompanied by his seeing-eye dog, Mallory. And he kinda comes in and stops a little bit into the room and, like, cocks his head to the side, sort of listening to the conversations in the room.
Minna (as Myra): Briggs.
Rhi (as Briggs): Ah, good, you’re here.
Rhi: And he comes over to your table and will take a seat. Kinda scritches Mallory behind the years and is like:
Rhi (as Briggs): [sighs] Well, I, um, I’m glad I caught you. I needed to talk to you about, well, that house you burned down a few days ago. I understand the motive, but—
Minna (as Myra): Sorry…
Kim (as Blaire): Huh?
Minna (as Myra): The house? That we what?
Rhi (as Briggs): That you burned down.
Minna (as Myra): We didn’t burn down any houses.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, I did a ritual two days ago, but I had an extinguisher on me, I didn’t burn down The Nest, so…
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi (as Briggs): Well, unless The Nest is in Charhollow, I don’t think that’s… a business owner’s home, new, very expensive home, got burned to the ground, and this was found at the scene.
Rhi: And he sets down in the middle of the table a lightly charred Magpie pin.
Minna (as Myra): That does sound like us. But it wasn’t.
Kim: Are there any discrepancies between this pin and our actual pin, if I inspected it further?
Rhi: Yes. I had that planned in my notes.
Kim: Oh my God.
Rhi: So yeah, if Blaire picks up the pin and examines it more closely— at first glance, if you just were looking at it quickly, yeah, it looks like a Magpie pin. But when you pick it up and study it, you can tell, one, that it’s made of a much cheaper metal. Like, you can almost bend the pin with your hands. And two, you know, with Minx in the mix, the pins that you get are very nice. They’ve got, you know, high-quality metal, enamel for the colors, like, they look good. This looks like it was just somebody painted it. You know, it is not the same level of quality that you all have in your pins. So, it looks very similar, but it is not one of yours.
Kim: Hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): So, we have a fan club. An extremely enthusiastic fan club.
Rhi (as Briggs): I mean, I… well, I suppose, but if you do have a fan club, they’re causing quite a few problems. The owner of the house that got burned down is a business owner, Darien Nuncio. Kind of a scumbag to be honest. He owns some shops and some apartment buildings, and if you work at one of his shops, he makes you rent an apartment from him too, and he takes most of your paycheck in rent. And then if he catches you shopping at some place that isn’t one of his stores, you get fired and evicted. So, he ends up taking pretty much the entire paycheck back from anybody that works from him.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, that’s kinda bullshit.
Rhi (as Briggs): Yeah. So, can’t say that I’m real torn up about him losing his house, except for he’s pretty pissed about it. He’s hired some Bluecoats to come around when they’re off-duty and rough people up, look for information. Fortunately, one of my contacts got on the scene before they did and found the pin. So, they haven’t quite tied it to all of you yet. Or, I guess, whoever your fan is. Ugh, are you sure it’s a fan? Maybe somebody’s trying to frame you.
Minna (as Myra): Both are possible. But it does sound like somebody who would agree with us. Unless it’s a really elaborate plot by this Darien person.
Rhi (as Briggs): Mm. I don’t know if he’s the type. He spent a lot of money on this house.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, it— hmm. So, the problem is the Bluecoats that are coming into the area?
Rhi (as Briggs): Yeah. They’re dragging people out of their houses for questioning and roughing up people in the streets and just generally being a menace. So, I know that you’re not behind the house fire, but we could use your help in dealing with the fallout from it. If you could figure out who is behind it too, that would help a lot.
Kim (as Blaire): We can look into it.
Rhi (as Briggs): Appreciate it.
Minna (as Myra): Does feel strange to be asked to help The Bluecoats do their job.
Rhi (as Briggs): I don’t know if I’d say you’re helping The Bluecoats do their job. Depending on who this person is, you might not necessarily wanna turn them in, just convince them to not pull stunts like this anymore, you know?
Minna (as Myra): Yeah.
Rhi (as Briggs): Mostly, we just need The Bluecoats to back off. But anyway, you can keep the pin. Don’t really need it and it’s probably safer with all of you. Don’t have to worry about it falling into the wrong hands and somebody getting the wrong idea.
Rhi: Is there anything else you wanna ask Briggs before he heads out?
Minna: Are there any, like, rivals of Nuncio that he knows about?
Rhi: Um… let’s do some kinda Gather Information roll for that.
Minna: That’s a 6.
Rhi: He doesn’t really have rivals. Like, he’s kinda— the stores he runs are, like, grocery and home goods type things, and he kinda has a monopoly on that sorta stuff in Charhollow. Like, you can find some much smaller businesses, but he’s run a lot of other people out of the district, and Briggs can tell you that, like, people who work for him, like, if they go to The Weeping Lady for food, he’ll fire you. You have to— he wants his employees to be 100% dependent on him.
Minna: Well that sounds predatory.
Kim: Fucked up.
Rhi: Mm hmm. The only reason that he doesn’t pay them in, like, company scrip is then The Empire couldn’t take out taxes on it. We can’t have that, you’re not gonna deny the Emperor anything. So, Briggs is gonna head on out, say goodbye to Rigney. Rigney will kind of distractedly look up from his notes. [laughs] Did not realize that Briggs had entered, only realizes that this is happening as he’s leaving. Waves. Goes back to his scheduling.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: So, yeah, if you two wanna do some more gathering of info on this whole situation?
Kim: Yeah, absolutely. I wanna go to— if it won’t gather too much heat, I wanna go to Charhollow, to the scene of the crime, and do some ghost field inspection.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, um, I think… I’m gonna have you— so, I’m gonna have you make two rolls.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: One of those rolls is gonna be the actual Gather Information roll and the other roll is gonna be for kinda how stealthy you can be while doing this.
Kim: Hmm. Okay.
Rhi: And the stealthiness roll, I’m gonna add that into— I’ll keep that in consideration when I do the Engagement roll. Like, if you do well on this, that’ll help, if you do poorly on it, that’ll hurt.
Kim: I see.
Rhi: So, yeah.
Kim: So, which one would you like me to roll first?
Rhi: Let’s do the stealth. However you wanna do stealthiness first.
Kim: Okay, this is probably gonna be Prowl.
Rhi: Probably. That sounds reasonable.
Kim: It’s a 4?
Rhi: Doesn’t hurt, doesn’t help. So, you are stealthy enough that you don’t attract attention. Or you don’t attract too much attention, we’ll say.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: But yeah, so you head over to the scene of the crime. You know, we again see that quiet residential street, the tall, wrought iron fence. The gates have, like, a chain and a padlock around them now, and there’s like a police barricade sign thing in front of them. A Bluecoat barricade in front of them. The brigade, you know, got out here before it completely burned to the ground, but it is… it got pretty well gutted. It looks like the roof collapsed, it’s blackened, windows are blown out, you know. It’s not gonna be livable. It’s gonna have to be torn down. So, if you want to look into the ghost field and see what you can see?
Kim: Yes. I would like to roll Attune and see, brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?
Rhi: Oh.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: If you get a 6…
Kim: 6. [laughs] My other rolls were a 3 and a 2.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think that you concentrate and look into the ghost field and— you know, the ghost field, as we have discussed, can do a great many things. It can show you a great many things. And in this case, it kind of shows you the memory of this house dying.
Kim: Cool.
Rhi: The house, when you look into the ghost field and you kind of concentrate on this, the house is actually very faint in the ghost field. It was too new and hadn’t been lived in enough to sort of really imprint on the ghost field. Really old buildings that have— that are well lived-in, that have a lot of people come through, they can leave a very strong imprint in the ghost field, even after the physical structure is torn down, sometimes you can see the memory of a building. This one, not so much. It was too new for that. So, there’s just kind of a very faint outline of the house. And what you do see is a person, the silhouette in the ghost field of a living person, moving towards the house.
You basically kind of see in very faint silhouette that opening sequence of someone throwing, you know, oil or throwing liquid onto the house and then throwing something burning. And then you can kind of see these ghostly flames consuming the house. But what you’re also able to see is this person fleeing from the burning home. What information—like, you got a 6, so what information would you like to get from this?
Kim: The arsonist.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think like, the person, kinda where you’re standing you’re off to the side and they, the figure runs towards you and you can’t see, like, the fence in the ghost field, because the fence doesn’t have any kind of imprint.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Nor does— you’re guessing it’s a rope, based on how the person is moving and climbing to get over the fence. But you do get, kind of as they come up to the fence, you do get a look at their face. It’s a young woman, you know, you’re guessing probably around your age, Blaire. Maybe a year or two older.
Kim: Oh, really? A baby?
Rhi: Mm hmm. A wee bab.
Kim: Wow. Usually everybody’s older than me, so that’s a surprise.
Rhi: Light skin, freckles, you can’t see her hair because of the hood that she’s got on. She has a scarf kinda pulled up over her nose. She’s got, like, freckles all over her skin.
Kim: So, me?
Rhi: You can still see them— yes. [laughs] You can still see them even with the scarf covering her nose. You don’t recognize her. This is not a face you’ve ever seen before. But you’re pretty sure that if you saw her again, you would know who she was. You get a very clear—
Kim: I’d be able to pick her out of a Bluecoat line.
Rhi: So yeah, you get a good look at her face and then she kinda— she scrambles over the fence and drops to the ground, kind of this ghostly image next to you, and then runs off and fades away. And then the memory of the house burning down fades as well and you’re just kinda left looking at this burned-out husk. I mean, with a 6, you can ask me follow-up questions if there’s any other details you would like to get about the incident.
Kim: Okay. Do I have a sense of which direction the arsonist ran?
Rhi: She— you’re like standing in an alley beside it. She ran down the alley and turned west. But that just leads out onto another major street.
Kim: It doesn’t really tell me, like, what town she would have bailed to next?
Rhi: She probably— you can guess she probably lives in Charhollow, Crow’s Foot, Silkshore, or Barrowcleft.
Kim: Really narrowing it down, okay.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] If she lived in, like, Coalridge or Nightmarket or Six Towers, she probably would have turned east.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: As much as you’re able to get from what you see, so…
Kim: Great. Okay. Um… the only trace they’ve left at the scene of the crime was the pin? Nothing else?
Rhi: So, I think, yeah, if you circle around the house to the side where you saw her throw the bottle and kinda peer through the bars, there is a piece of glass just within arms reach of the fence. It’s curved and it has, like, paper stuck to it. It doesn’t look like a window. And you stick your arm through and you manage to grab it and you pull it over, and it is a chunk of a bottle that has a label for a cheap Skovlan vodka on it.
Kim: Hmm. Okay. I assume I can take this?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Okay. Blaire collects it.
Rhi: A little videogame inventory pops up.
Kim: Shing!
Rhi: You’ve acquired.
Kim: Press Y to inspect.
Rhi: [laughs] So, let’s go over to Myra.
Minna: I’m going to do my little thing where I help people out with, like, little legal papers and things and I’m going to kind of, just like, bring it— slip it into conversations that I heard some whispers about some young people who had some rather fiery ideas and I was wondering…
Rhi: [snorts]
Minna: You know, I was a little bit worried, and I was just wondering if there was any way I could help them deal with that. [laughs]
Kim: Way not to sound like an undercover cop.
Rhi: [laughs] Myra does sound like a cop when you phrase it like that, shit.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: No, it’s fine.
Minna: I’m at least a tiny bit known to these people, so like—
Rhi: Oh yeah. Yeah, if you’re asking around—
Minna: I’m phrasing it a way that I’m trying to help them.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: But it’s still a little bit, “How do you do, fellow kids?”
Minna: It is a little bit, “How do you do, fellow kids?” [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: But also, I’ve been that kid.
Rhi: Yeah. Go ahead and make a roll.
Minna: Is this a Consort? Or is this a Sway. Okay…
Rhi: I think it’s Consort. You’re not trying to deceive the citizenry of Charhollow.
Minna: Well, I rolled a 3 on that one.
Rhi: Okay. So, you get a limited amount of information. What kind of information would you like to get from this? Because that’ll help me figure out how to give you a piece of that information.
Minna: Where those kinds of kids would gather or what things these kinds of kids would be affiliated with. Like, just a lead to, like, talk to some people who might know.
Rhi: Yeah. Where’s the local skate park where all the youths hang out.
Minna: [laughs and wheezes]
Kim: You either skate or you die.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Where do all the angry kids go to talk about how angry they are?
Kim: Obviously the Blink 182 concert.
Rhi: [laughs] Um, so… oh man. See, now that you’ve said that, I do kinda wanna have it be somewhere where some kind of music…
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: I think there’s a, like, there’s a dive bar where local musicians will perform, but they tend to be kind of the like…
Kim: It’s definitely like a self-printed zine.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean basically, it’s like, yeah, well it’s the like, anarchist… it’s the, you know, artists of the anarchist and unionization movements, basically. Because you— for any kind of movement like that there, you know, you have the artists and musicians and writers. And I think there’s a dive bar that hosts those kinds of performances. And I think that you learn that a lot of, you know, a lot of the disaffected youth will hang out there. Yeah, I’m gonna make you two come up with the name of this dive bar.
Kim: Mm…
Minna: Hmm.
Kim: That’s dangerous.
Rhi: And by “you two”, I mean Minna, because Minna is the one that I can trust to come up with names.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: Oh, come on!
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: I mean, my first thought was The Rusty Screw, which isn’t good. [laughs]
Kim: I mean, my brain was trying to come up with, like, a Red Hot Chili Peppers pun, so…
Rhi: [laughs] God help me. I’m gonna, okay, I’m vetoing all your ideas and I’m going—
Kim: No!
Rhi: For Chicago history. It is The Haymarket Tavern.
Minna: So, I obviously have to take the coolest youth I know with me, right? [laughs]
Rhi: Mm hmm, and that is?
Minna: The one with the most eyeliner.
Rhi: True.
Kim: Darkness Dementia Ebony Raven Way?
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Do you wanna go by that now?
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: No! No, I forbid it.
[laughter]
Rhi: Alright, let’s get back on track. [laughs] So, yeah, you’re gonna head over to The Haymarket Tavern. I think— do you wanna, like, wait until it’s more into night properly and there’s, like, a show happening? Or do you just wanna head over now?
Minna: I think maybe let’s wait until there’s a show happening.
Rhi: Okay. You get there. The bar is, you know, pretty crowded. Lots of people hanging around. You know, there’s musicians performing, singing songs about revolution through clever allegory so they won’t get arrested for it. Lot of people at the bar, lot of people at tables. I think you might actually recognize a couple of, like, Belle Brogan’s people from the union movement here talking to some tables. And yeah, you’ve got a bar full of people, many of whom are disaffected youths. What would you like to do?
Kim: Um, yeah, Minna’s the only one here, right?
Rhi: No, I think you came.
Minna: No, I brought you specifically.
Rhi: Yeah, she brought you specifically.
Minna: Because you would fit in and I wouldn’t.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Anarchy!
Rhi: Yeah, Blaire does, like, in terms of appearance look more— and age—
Minna: Wait. Wait. Wait. Did Blaire have to give me a makeover? [laughs]
Kim: [gasps]
Rhi: God, yes.
Kim: Yeah, probably. You’re probably looking a little goth right now.
Minna: I love it.
Rhi: Incredible. Minx absolutely contributed to this.
Kim (as Blaire): Grunge is in!
Minna: Myra’s definitely more grunge than fancy goth.
Rhi: Yeah. And this is not a fancy goth setting.
Minna: Yeah, so it works.
Rhi: So, yeah. Yeah, what do the two of you wanna do?
Kim: Uh, I think this might be the one occasion where Blaire mingles and it actually sort of works— well, we’ll see if the dice says it works out or not. But Blaire could mingle here.
Rhi: Yeah. Go for it.
Kim: Yeah. I’m gonna roll a Consort to see what info I get.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Okay, 6 and a 1?
Rhi: 6. Okay. So, what kind of info are you trying to get?
Kim: Who did a good crime lately? Um, who really stuck it to the cops lately?
Rhi: [laughs] Are you presenting yourself as Blaire Culhane of The Magpies or are you just, like, kinda trying to mingle?
Kim: Fuck it, Blaire Culhane of The Magpies is here.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so I think if— yeah, you start chatting yourself up and introducing yourself that way, like, you get a fair amount of attention. You end up with a little crowd around you of people who are like, “Holy shit, you’re part of The Magpies? Are you for real?” Like, and you know, not everything that you all have done, but they know a lot of what you have done, especially in Charhollow and like, they really admire you and respect you. There’s a little bit of— and, like, somebody asks for your autograph and I don’t know how Blaire feels about that?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah, totally.
Rhi: They’re very impressed to meet you. And are, like, very grateful for what you and the rest of The Magpies have done. And yeah, like, when you start asking, you know, what have people done around her lately, somebody will mention that it’s a shame that Larissa isn’t here tonight because she would have loved to meet you.
Kim: Whomst?
Rhi: And you kinda ask after her and you get the name Larissa Dolbrev.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: You know, hasn’t been around for a little while. She was talking about, like, she had been talking about doing something big. Had been kinda vague on the details, but nobody’s really seen her for a little bit. She hasn’t been coming out to the sort of usual hangs lately.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: But yeah, you manage to get a name of a person who very much admires your work and may have been plotting something big.
Kim: interesting. Good to know.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra, I got a name.
Minna (as Myra): You got a name?
Kim (as Blaire): I got a name. Potential lead. Larissa Dolbrev.
Minna (as Myra): Did you get anything else, or just the name?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, the name and that they’ve been missing in action a little while and that they’re a big fan of me.
Rhi: Well, fan of The Magpies, generally.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, I shouldn’t let the fame go to my head. Big fan of us.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Somebody has kind of trailed after Blaire and is like:
Rhi (as Youth): Oh my God, are you… are you Myra Keel?
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Hello.
Rhi (as Youth): [nervously] Hi! We’re huge fans of your work, like, I mean The Magpies work, all that you all do. Like, it’s just so inspiring and we’re just… yeah. You’re really cool. You’re like actually out there doing it! Like, sticking it to the authorities.
Kim (as Blaire): Fuck yeah, we are.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: I think Myra, like, thanks them graciously, but she is also like, her brain is, like, visibly dying.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Minna: Like, do not— does not compute. She has never had to deal with this before.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: It’s nice, but it’sweird.
Rhi: Yeah. I think, and some of it— like, some of it is just kind of a general like, “Hell yeah, you’re cool,” but some people, like, thank you for specific things. Like, somebody says that they, you know, had a relative who has been to the clinic that you all helped over and recovered from this cough that they’d had for a really long time and, you know, just, people are very grateful for the stuff that you all have done.
Minna: So, I think she is probably getting into these conversations, and like, occasionally she’ll be like:
Minna (as Myra): Well, I heard that this friend of yours, Larissa, maybe hasn’t been around in a while?
Minna: So she’s gonna be kinda like, asking questions about her, I think.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I think that’s another Consort. 6.
Rhi: Okay. Myra, that name kinda pinged you a little bit, and eventually somebody mentions Larissa’s mother, Agnes Dolbrev. And that’s when it clicks, like, Agnes has come to see you a couple times about some legal paperwork. She is a Skovlan refugee. Akarosi is not her first language, so she can speak the language well enough to get by, but reading it is a struggle, particularly when your dealing with a, you know, complex legal document. So, she’s brought some things to you just to make sure that she understands, you know, what she’s signing before she signs it. And you do remember that a couple times she brought her daughter with her and I think you’re able to get an address for where the Dolbrevs live.
Minna: Oh, nice. So, I think it’s:
Minna (as Myra): Thank you. I’m just worried about her.
Rhi (as Youth): Yeah. Yeah, if you can go check on her, I mean, one, like, if she’s there and she’s okay she’ll be thrilled to meet you, but yeah. If you just make sure that she’s okay?
Minna (as Myra): Of course. Don’t spread around that we’ve been ask— that we’ve been interested in… I don’t think it would help their case.
Rhi (as Youth): Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, we won’t tell anybody that we saw you here, don’t worry.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi: Yeah, so do you wanna just pay them a visit?
Minna: Yes, I would love to pay them a visit.
Rhi: [laughs] Alright, so the two of you are gonna—
Minna: I’m gonna do it during daylight— well, not daylight hours. I’m gonna do it during…
Rhi: During the day?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So, are the two of you gonna head over there?
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: So, next day you head on out and they, it’s a, you know, kind of a typical-looking apartment building in the area. They live on the sixth floor, so it’s a bit of a climb to get there. And yeah, you reach the apartment.
Minna: Myra’s gonna knock on the door.
Rhi: You can hear, like, footsteps inside and then there’s, like, a gasp, audible gasp through the door. And then the door flies open and Blaire, you immediately recognize the young woman standing there with huge eyes whos’ just like:
Rhi (as Larissa): Oh, wow, you’re actually here. Hello! My name is Larissa. Uh, it’s an honor to meet you!
Minna (as Myra): Hello, Larissa.
Kim (as Blaire): Pleasure is ours.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Yes.
Rhi (as Larissa): Um, I, uh, I guess you heard about what I did?
Rhi: Big excited grin.
Minna (as Myra): Let’s take this somewhere inside, away from prying ears.
Rhi (as Larissa): Oh! Yes, yes, of course, of course. I’ve been having to keep a low profile the last few days. Lots of Bluecoats prowling around.
Rhi: She will shut the door and lock it. It’s looks like it’s a one-bedroom apartment. Pretty small. There is a bed out in kind of the living area. You’re guessing that either her mom sleeps out here or… one of them sleeps out in the living room, the other one has the bedroom. Yeah, she kind like, you know, spins around is still just like, beaming, like rally proud of herself.
Rhi (as Larissa): Um, right, so how did you find out? Was it the pin?
Minna (as Myra): It was the pin. We wanted to talk to you—
Rhi (as Larissa): I have lots more!
Minna (as Myra): Oh. Okay.
Rhi: [laughs] She runs off to the bed, goes under it and pulls out a bag that clinks a lot.
Minna: Oh my God.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Minna (as Myra): Larissa. You need to be careful with what you do with that pin. We have been gathering a higher profile and we’re having to be more careful as well of where we use our energy, because wherever our mark is, more people are gonna come sniffing around.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ve actually been taking a break. We didn’t know there was an arson until one of our contacts told us about it.
Rhi (as Larissa): Well, I mean, that’s sort of the idea is that, you know, we could, you know, me and some of my friends who really admire your work, we could help and do things when you need to take a break or hide from The Bluecoats or things like that.
Minna (as Myra): The sentiment is really, really admirable, Larissa, and I can understand exactly why you chose this target. I think we just need to talk about thinking through consequences before we act. Does that sound fair?
Rhi: She, like, [laughs] I think is finally picking up on the vibe of, like, you two are not 100% enthusiastic about this. And kinda deflates a little bit and is like:
Rhi (as Larissa): Um… yes, I suppose.
Minna (as Myra): We’re not here for a lecture. We just, we’ve been hearing about an increased Bluecoat presence in the area, and we were a little bit worried about that, about what that means for your neighbors.
Rhi (as Larissa): Oh.
Rhi: Yeah, so she’s just kinda standing there, like, looking back and forth between the two of you, like, starting to look a little worried.
Minna (as Myra): We’ve been reckoning with some of this ourselves recently. The more you act and get noticed, the more other people around you are going to potentially be brought in on some of the fallout. And that’s definitely something you have to weigh. Larissa, would you be open to being connected with other people who are doing work in this area?
Rhi (as Larissa): Like… what kind of people? [sighs] Mother keeps telling me that I should, like, volunteer with The Weeping Lady and they do good work, but like, it’s not— it doesn’t change anything the way that you do!
Minna (as Myra): Okay. Well, I can tell you a couple of people who are working to make changes that you might be interested in. We’ve got Belle Brogan and their unionization efforts—
Rhi (as Larissa): You know Miss Brogan?
Minna (as Myra): A little bit, yes, and I could see if she needs more help. We also have some people who are working to put out better news than the Doskvol Daily puts out. If you or your friends would be interested in helping them, I’m sure they could use help.
Rhi (as Larissa): Yeah. That— that sounds like it might be good. But, um, I mean, it doesn’t seem very… uh, direct. The way that you do things.
Kim (as Blaire): I know it doesn’t sound very radical, but changing the public opinion and working the press is one of the most vital things you can do to get the truth out there.
Rhi: Can I have you two give me, like, a group Consort? This won’t have consequences, I just wanna see how persuasive you are in convincing this young woman to turn her energy in a more fruitful direction.
Kim: That’s a 6, my dude.
Minna: I got a 5. So, nobody takes any stress and it’s a 6.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, so Larissa kinda nods really thoughtfully and is like:
Rhi (as Larissa): Okay. Um, I mean, I know I’d be really honored to meet Miss Brogan or your friends with the paper. That would be great.
Minna (as Myra): How about this? You said you have other friends who are interested, right?
Rhi (as Larissa): Mm hmm.
Minna (as Myra): Why don’t you talk to them, see what they’re interested in. We can try to arrange meetings, I mean, if you can find maybe a representative for people who wanna be meeting each group. And then we can try and arrange some kind of meeting.
Rhi (as Larissa): Yeah, that would be great. Um… uh…
Rhi: And she kinda looks down at the bag of presumably— it’s not like a huge bag. I’m picturing like, you know, sandwich baggie size. But it’s still pretty full. She clearly made a lot of pins. [laughs] Is like:
Rhi (as Larissa): Um, should we keep, like, leaving these around, or…
Minna (as Myra): I think that they could be a powerful symbol. You have to be careful about the power of the symbol.
Rhi: Looks very thoughtful and nods ands then, like, a lightbulb seems to go off and is like:
Rhi (as Larissa): Oh no, have you— are you all in trouble because of the fire?
Kim (as Blaire): Not yet, no. No, not yet.
Rhi (as Larissa): Oh dear. Oh.
Minna (as Myra): Our friends found the pin before The Bluecoats did.
Rhi (as Larissa): Oh, good. Oh… I didn’t even think about that.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, and maybe best if you just, you know, sell this as fanart? Or something?
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi (as Larissa): Alright. Yeah. I’ll be more careful about what we do with these.
Rhi: Yeah, she nods and looks, like, very thoughtful and, like, a little embarrassed.
Minna (as Myra): Hey, Larissa? Don’t look so down. It’s really impressive what you’ve already— that you’ve already started on this path. We’re just worried. We’re just worried.
Rhi (as Larissa): Okay. I am— wow, I really appreciate that. Um, I, uh… alright. I’ll talk to my friends and see what I can figure out.
Minna (as Myra): Okay. Do you know how to get in contact with us if you need to?
Rhi (as Larissa): Um… well, the couple times that I’ve seen you around was with my mother. So, that was around here. I don’t know where to meet with you necessarily.
Minna (as Myra): If you or any of your friends need something, take a note up, or if you need to, come up to The Hound’s Paw up in Nightmarket. We usually pick up our notes there.
Rhi (as Larissa): Alright. Um, is, wow… do you— oh gosh, do you all, like, do you want tea? Do you want something to eat? Um, I am a terrible host.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] It’s alright, Larissa.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh sweetheart, sweetheart, it’s okay.
Rhi: Alright, so you leave, after a little while, the Dolbev home, having convinced your young fan to turn her energy in a more useful direction. Now you still have the issue of the Bluecoats who are terrorizing the district to try and figure out who’s behind the fire to contend with. So, you did Gather Info on dealing with your fan. Now you’ve gotta deal with your antifans. Your haters.
Minna: I hate the phrase “haters”, but you’re not wrong.
Rhi: I’m not wrong.
Kim: We do it for the girls and the gays, that’s it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: How do we deal with the Bluecoat presence?
Kim: Do we get back in touch with Severin and see if he can put in a good word for us?
Rhi: You could try that. You could— so from what Briggs told you, this Nuncio fellow is basically bribing a bunch of Bluecoats to come down here and harass people until he gets the information he wants.
Kim: Severin is the only idea I’ve got.
Minna: So, is he particularly worried about it being The Magpies, or does he just wanna know who it is, no matter who it is?
Rhi: He wants to know who it is. Cause yeah, one of Briggs’s informants managed to get the pin before the Bluecoats saw it, so the Bluecoats do not suspect that it is The Magpies at this point.
Kim: Now, to me this just sounds like we have to do a Gather Info on this guy’s, you know, personal enemies.
Minna: Yeah. Personal enemies, people who are trying to get a foothold in Charhollow of any kind…
Rhi: Yeah. And you, I think that Kim, your idea of talking to Severin is also a good one.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: He can at least give you some insight on kind of Bluecoat operating procedures to see if there’s any weak points on that side.
Kim: Yeah. Um, I could try talking to Severin. I could roll a Consort.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: 1 and a 3.
Rhi: Ooh, okay. So, I think what happens is you are actually not able to meet directly with Severin at all. I think, like, you send him a note, high level, “Here’s the situation, can we meet?” And he sends a note back that’s basically like, “There is too much heat on you right now for me to safely meet with you,” but what he’s kind of able to convey in this short note of sort of general helping as much as he can is that the Bluecoats are profit-motivated. If they are not getting paid, they’re not gonna keep doing this thing. So, that’s kind of the weak point on that side. If the money is cut off, they will not continue to harass the citizenry.
Kim: Okay.
Minna: I’m trying to think who we know who would have the good gossip. Would it be Amancio?
Rhi: It depends on what level of society you’re looking at.
Minna: I mean, I’m looking at Nuncio’s level.
Rhi: So, Amancio is probably a little high-class for this.
Minna: Just trying to think who I could ask.
Rhi: You could try talking to some of the people who work for him, see if they’ve heard any gossip.
Minna: That’s true. Yeah, lets just try and talk to some of the workers.
Rhi: Yeah!
Minna: So, I’m gonna ask around and see if I can find somebody to talk to. Am I rolling Consort?
Rhi: Yeah, I think that’s probably Consort.
Minna: 5.
Rhi: Okay. So, a standard amount of information. You start asking around, you visit some of his shops, chat with some of the employees, you know, how things are going. And I think, like, it takes a little while. I think you have to catch people., like, when they’re on their break and a lot of them are pretty hesitant to talk initially, but you know, you, again, can kind of play up on your reputation here. People generally feel pretty favorably towards The Magpies. So, they’re willing to talk to you a little bit and Nuncio’s business and in particular, his side business.
Because what you learn from a few of the workers, particularly the ones who kind do the, like, inventory, so loading and unloading the shipments and things, is that he has a little side operation of smuggling. Specifically, he is trafficking spirits. He moves spirits from, you know, Whispers who collect them and generally sells them to other traffickers or alchemists who are converting them into ghost drugs. Probably a lot to The Dimmer Sisters, since they control most of the spirit-trafficking trade in the city. And yeah, they will tell you that, you know, a couple times a month some crates full of jars come in that are set aside, somebody peeked at them once and got possessed. [laughs]
Kim: Whoopsie daisy.
Rhi: And so, yeah, they will let you know that he’s got this thing on the side that, again, like, because he’s got his workers in such a precarious situation with their jobs and their homes and everything, none of them have dared speak up about it. Just cause, you know, if anybody steps out of line you’re out of a job, you’re out of a home. Things can go bad very, very fast.
Minna: So uh, also, do we get any kind of proof?
Rhi: Oh, I think, okay. So, I think that they will tell you the shipments show up kinda regularly, and they will tell you that the next one is supposed to show up in a few days.
Minna: So, either he stops playing off the Bluecoats or we alert them to the next shipment.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Although, he could just move the shipment.
Rhi: He could.
Minna: If we take the shipment, it’s proof. Do we need to take the shipment? We need to take the shipment.
Kim: I think so.
Rhi: Blaire probably wants to take the shipment anyway. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: I think Myra comes back to The Nest.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah?
Minna (as Myra): Are you up for intercepting some spirit trafficking?
Kim (as Blaire): Fuck yeah.
Rhi: Okay. I feel like maybe this is— we are actually at the score.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: So, it sounds like the score is gonna be, I think, stealing the shipment and then delivering the blackmail note. Do you wanna try and hit it at one of his stores, do you want to try and intercept before it reaches?
Minna: Intercept before it reaches is kinda like our signature.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Why mess with a good thing? It’s worked in the past.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Okay. I think you may need to do another Gather Info to figure out where the route is.
Minna: Yes.
Kim: Should we both do that or cover our bases?
Rhi: Blaire, you might actually— this might be something where you could talk to The Reconciled, because they tend to be kind of aware of the spirit-trafficking that’s happening in the city.
Kim: True.
Rhi: So, they might know.
Kim: Yep. That’s a 5 and a 6.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, you kind of describe this setup to one of The Reconciled and they’re able to give you a— I think there’s a particular, like, a section of catacombs that is pretty much only used by smugglers. And it tends to be specifically used by spirit-traffickers because its intensely haunted. There’s just tons of, like, ghosts and other spooky stuff down there.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Most people don’t wanna deal with that, but if you’re already carrying jars full of ghosts you probably are equipped to deal with it.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: So, I think you can either hit them kind of as they’re going into this section, as they’re coming out, you can try and ambush them in the middle. It’s up to you.
Kim: I was thinking mid-point, unless you had any objections, Minna?
Minna: I like that.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Alright. So, let’s figure out the Engagement roll. So, it’s gonna be 2d6 Engagement roll. Oh no.
Kim: Oh no?
Rhi: That’s a 3.
Minna: No!
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Oh, well. It could be 1.
Rhi: I mean, the other die I rolled was a 1. [laughs]
Kim: Eesh. Oh, no.
Rhi: Yeah… so yeah, you’re gonna be in a desperate position when the action starts.
Minna: Oh gosh.
Kim: Don’t like that.
Rhi: You make your way into these tunnels and you find a spot to lie in wait for this particular smuggler who’s supposed to be coming through on this day with a crate of ghosts in jars marked for Darien Nuncio. And… trying to think of what a good desperate situation here would be…
Kim: Um… maybe some of Larissa’s friends haven’t gotten the message yet and they’re here?
Rhi: Oh no!
Minna: Oh no… yeah, absolutely.
Rhi: I like that. Yeah.
Minna: Oh, buddies.
Rhi: So, I think the two of you come down here and you hunker down. And like, you got here, you know, a bit early so you would have plenty of time to catch this person. So, you’re a little worried when you hear, like, shuffling footsteps coming up behind you and you, like, peek out and you see a trio of teenagers who are sporting some of Larissa’s homemade Magpie pins on their jackets.
Minna: [whispers] Oh my gosh.
Rhi: And then when they see that you’ve seen them, they kinda like wave and skitter over and, like, try to get into your hiding spot like:
Rhi (as Teenager): Hey!
Minna (as Myra): Ssh!
Rhi (as Teenager): Hey, Larissa said that, uh, you had work for us, so we followed to help.
Minna (as Myra): Ssh. Be quiet, as quiet as you can. This is a potentially dangerous situation.
Rhi (as Teenager): Oh, okay. Uh, yeah, I mean we figured, we brought— we’re ready for stuff.
Rhi: And like, I think the kid who’s talking holds open their jacket and they have, like, a kitchen knife. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh… that’s… that’s not gonna cut it.
Minna (as Myra): I think Myra takes, like, the hands of the one closest to her and is like:
Minna (as Myra): I appreciate your desire to help. This is not a situation where more people is a good idea.
Rhi: And as you say that, two things happen. The first is that you hear the footsteps you were expecting. It’s like footsteps and, like, the clattering of a cart being pushed. And two, it gets really, really cold around you all of a sudden.
Minna: I think Myra, like, squeezes her eyes shut for just a second. Like, oh no.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, friends are here. Okay.
Rhi: [laughs] Myra, you have a spiritbane charm. Blaire—
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: You regard them as friends. You have no idea if these kids have any kind of wards or charms. One of them kinda like tugs their coat a little closer and is like:
Rhi (as Teenager): Ooh, chilly down here. I didn’t expect that.
Rhi: So, you have three teenagers who have followed you down here. You have the target approaching and you have apparently some number of ghosts. Let me see what number of ghosts.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: You have some number of ghosts about to man—
Kim: You’re— you’re not gonna tell us?
Rhi: No! Of course not. Where’s the fun in that? Um, about to manifest here.
Minna: Kim? Is it possible to throw up shields for other people from ghosts, because…
Kim: Hmm. Is that possible, Rhi?
Rhi: Let’s find out.
Kim: Oh, do you want me to roll an Attune?
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah, this is gonna be, this is gonna be desperate.
Minna: Can I help?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, you can do this as a group. A group Attune, group magic. Who’s gonna lead?
Kim: Blaire can lead. I think it’s a bit more on-brand.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. I got a 2, 1, 6.
Rhi: Okay. So, a 6.
Minna: I got 4. So nobody marks any stress and we got a 6.
Rhi: Got a 6. Okay. What you see is things are getting really cold and, like, I’m imagining that the kids are kind of in a triangle, the leader has been sort of a little bit in front talking to you and then the other two are, like, a step or two back. And behind those two who are in the back, you can see one ghost behind each kid kind of manifests and starts moving in to them. And so, tell me how it looks as you extend some kind of big ward around yourselves.
Kim: Well, see, Blaire being Blaire, I have to feel as though the ward is— this is gonna sound bad— is less so to protect the people inside and more so to convince the ghost that there is something more interesting away from us.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: There’s still, like, that protective bubble, but I think what she does is try to conjure up some illusion. Maybe that there’s a scent trail of ectoplasm just around the corner when there really isn’t, something like that.
Rhi: Interesting. Yeah, I like the idea that with it being a Blaire thing, that it’s more of a deflection and distraction than protection.
Kim: I’m so bad at caring about living people.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Blaire’s a bad person, you guys! [laughs]
Rhi: She’s not a bad person, her priorities are just a little questionable sometimes. It’s okay. The two of you working together kinda twist the ghost field to make it look like there’s something more desirable in another direction. The ghosts kind of, you know, move away from the kids, who have no idea what just happened. They’re just kinda like:
Rhi (as Teenager): Whoa, what’d you do?
Kim (as Blaire): Saved you from being possessed, actually.
Rhi (as Teenager): Whoa, really? You’re so cool.
Kim (as Blaire): N-no… you all could have actually been possessed by a ghost. This is not really a joking or a cool thing. This is us saving your ass, because you being here actually complicates things just a smidge. We actually truly enjoy your support and it’s so humbling and we love it. But it is getting a little bit in our way!
Rhi: The— all three of their faces kind of fall as the clattering of the smuggler is getting closer and closer.
Minna (as Myra): What Blaire is trying to say is thank you very much, but more people is only going to escalate the situation. Please go home and talk—
Kim (as Blaire): We love you, but please go home!
Minna (as Myra): Talk to Larissa, we will get you work that you can help with soon.
Rhi: Can I have— I’m trying to figure out how to do this.
Minna: Are we doing a group Consort?
Rhi: No, no, it’s…
Minna: Sway?
Rhi: I need to see if you all can detect the consequence that’s about to hit.
Minna: Oh…
Kim: Hmm!
Rhi: So this might actually be a resistance. It’s gonna be Insight. I need you both to…
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Cause they all kind of, the three of them look very downtrodden and hang their heads.
Minna: Oh, babies.
Rhi: But—
Minna: 6!
Kim: Two 5s, a 1 and a 2.
Rhi: Okay. So, Blaire, in order to notice this, you’ll need to take one stress.
Kim: Okay. I can mark that. I can spare that.
Rhi: Myra, as usual, manages to take no stress on a resistance roll.
Minna: I don’t know how it happens.
Rhi: Like, I think— what I’m imagining is that these are catacombs, I’m imagining that you all are kind of off in a little side niche, and like, the three of them start to move towards the exit and the two of you simultaneously realize that if they go out there now, the smuggler’s gonna see them and that will blow your whole thing. Like, this ambush that you have carefully planned is gonna be ruined.
Minna: Yeah, I’m gonna reach out and grab some lapels and, like, pull them back. Or, like, scruffs of necks.
Rhi (as Teenager): [loudly] Whoa, what are you doing?!
Minna (as Myra): Ssh! Ssh!
Rhi (as Teenager): Oh, sorry. Sorry. What are you doing? I thought we were supposed to leave? You didn’t want our help.
Minna (as Myra): Change of plan. Stay right here until you don’t hear anything anymore, okay?
Rhi: I think actually I need you to make a roll.
Minna: I think it’s a Command.
Rhi: I think this is gonna be risky.
Minna: I’m gonna push myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: 5.
Rhi: The kid you’re talking to nods and the three of them kinda slink to the back of this little niche. The consequence is that the sounds outside of the cart and footsteps stop for a second and then start moving really fast. Like, this person’s just taking off at a dead run and they go clattering past you. This person has heard that there are people here and is sprinting away. So, you’re going to have to, like, whatever ambush you had has been blown. You’re gonna have to chase this person down now.
Minna: Yep.
Rhi: What are you gonna do?
Kim: Uh, cue the Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hills music and go after them.
Rhi and Minna: [laugh]
Kim: [sings tune]
Rhi: Alright, so yeah. Somebody give me some kinda action roll for what you’re gonna do.
Kim: What would we have to roll to chase them, would it be…
Rhi: Prowl.
Kim: Prowl?
Rhi: Prowl is kind of the physical.
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: I mean, you can also try other options. If you wanna do something to stop them that isn’t—
Kim: No, I’m running. I’m already shaking my dice, I’m rolling it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Consider that you could have the power of ghosts and anime on your side.
Kim and Rhi: [laugh]
Kim: That’s okay, I rolled a 5 for chasing after them.
Rhi: Okay, I’m going to give you a choice for chasing after them.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Either it’ll be reduced effect and they’re still pretty far ahead of you. Like, this person is moving shockingly fast given that they’re hauling a cart. Or Blaire, you catch up to them just as you cross, the two of you make it across a, like, a bridge that’s across a pretty wide chasm.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And it collapses behind you, so you and Myra and separated.
Minna: [squeals]
Kim: Hmm… I do like that drama. Minna?
Minna: That’s some Star Wars shit, I’m in.
Kim: Okay, yeah!
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, Minna just made a sound of pure delight, so yeah.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: Yeah, we’re doing it.
Minna: [laughs] Leave me alone. You said “there’s a bridge across a chasm” and I got excited.
Rhi: Listen, why is there a big chasm underneath Duskwall? I don’t know. But it’s there now! I don’t think it’s like a, you know, Star War-esque 40-foot across chasm.
Minna: No.
Rhi: But it’s too wide for Myra to jump. So, Blaire, I think you sprint across and I think you’re able to just, like, jump on this person and stop them. But the wooden bridge just collapses behind you.
Kim (as Blaire): Myra!
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, Myra, what are you— I imagine Myra had also taken off running?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: And you are now on the wrong side of the chasm. What would you like to try and do?
Minna: What is Blaire’s situation with this person?
Rhi: Blaire has just tackled them to the ground and they are momentarily, like, stunned. But I think that the person –
Minna: What’s the— okay, what does the, um, crate look like?
Rhi: It is a wooden crate that’s in a, like, a hand-cart. It’s not, like, waist-high cover crate, it’s not huge. Its probably, I’d say, maybe a foot tall and two feet wide.
Minna: Is it something that if we tied a rope around some part of it and then threw it into the chasm while I held one end of the rope, I could just haul it up?
Rhi: Yes… it’s full of glass jars that are full of ghosts.
Minna: That’s true. Never mind.
Rhi: You’re running a risk of those all breaking. [laughs]
Kim: I could try trapping some.
Minna: Is it— is this a risk you’re willing to take?
Rhi: Yeah. Here’s a— yeah, there is a chance you could make that work, but there is also a chance that it will—
Minna: I mean, we just know the consequences if we succeed but it’s—
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: And I’m saying in the event that those break, I’m prepared to handle it.
Minna: I only want the crate, honestly. Because it would leave traces if the ghost escaped, and then I’d still have proof. So, I think she’s gonna yell across the chasm:
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, tie a rope around it and throw me the other end!
Kim (as Blaire): Uh— okay…
Rhi: Alright. So, Blaire, the person you have tackled is a man who is about a foot taller than you. [laughs] The only reason you were able to tackle him is because he was not expecting to be tackled and you hit him in the knees. He’s not unconscious, you just knocked him down.
Kim: Cool.
Rhi: So, you are going to have to contend with this guy still being in the mix in order to do this.
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: So, I don’t know if you wanna try to deal with him first and then do the thing for Myra?
Kim: I mean, because Myra told me so, I feel like the crate first, might be first priority.
Rhi: Yeah. Go for it.
Minna: I mean, also, I can be covering you with a gun while you do this.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah. You could, if you wanted to aid Blaire in this rope thing, you could say that you have a gun that you’re pointing at this guy.
Minna: Yep, I’m gonna do that.
Rhi: Okay. So, yeah, you’re gonna need to roll something to tie the rope and I think on your end it’s going to be tying the rope around the thing and throwing it across. And then I think Myra’s gonna have to roll to grab it.
Kim: So, can I make an argument for Finesse?
Rhi: Hmm…
Kim: Or is this more of a general Prowl, Skirmish thing?
Rhi: Let me look at the description of…
Minna: I kinda like Finesse for this. Skillfully tying a rope and throw it.
Rhi: Finesse… “employ dexterous manipulation… what’s graceful or subtle about this?”
Minna: Hmm.
Kim: That’s true, this isn’t very subtle.
Rhi: Graceful stylish and subtle are kinda the tags for Finesse.
Kim: Yeah, see, I can make graceful and stylish, but subtle, no. So..
Rhi: Uh, you know what? Ill give you two outta three. You can do Finesse.
Kim: Okay. 5, 5, 3?
Rhi: 5. Okay. So, you do it but there’s a consequence. And I think the consequence is you are gonna end up in a desperate position. You really quick, you run over, you grab the crate, you tie the rope, you do it, like you’re just doing it very smoothly and quickly, you hurl it and the rope out into the void and then, you know, we’ll kind of as— I’m picturing this in, like, slow-mo— you throw it, Myra moves to grab the rope and we’ll resolve that in a second, and Blaire, you’re just grabbed from behind and this guy, like, basically bearhugs you and picks you up and is kind of using you as a shield so that Myra can’t really shoot him. And he’s got ahold of you. You’re in a desperate position.
Kim: Ah, fuck.
Rhi: Myra. [laughs] You gotta grab this rope.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: You’ll need to roll something to grab the rope.
Minna: I think this is— the roll on this is also Finesse, right?
Rhi: Yeah, I’d say so.
Minna: Dexterous manipulation. Well, I mean, Finesse is not my best roll, but it’s the one that seems to fit best.
Rhi: I mean, you could also do Prowl for this.
Minna: I’ll do Prowl, then.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I’m trying to think— I think I may actually take stress again for this.
Rhi: Okay, pushing yourself?
Minna: Mm hmm. Three dice. Because honesty, if we don’t have to deal with broken glass, it’s better. 5. We’re probably dealing with broken glass. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. So, they don’t all break, but a couple of them do. And like, you catch the rope and it keeps swinging, but it slams into the side of this chasm. And you hear some glass shatter. It’s not all of them, but some of them broke. So, you’ve got a couple ghosties loose. Blaire is being grappled.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, can you use this?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, kinda busy!
Minna: Can I try to use it to help her?
Rhi: Yeah. Anybody can Attune.
Minna: Alright, Let’s try this.
Rhi: [laughs] So, what are you doing?
Minna: I don’t really know how much you can do with a ghost if you get control of them, but I’m okay with siccing a ghost on this guy.
Rhi: Yeah. So, specifically, like, there’s a particular Whisper power that gives you the ability to actually just control ghosts. You would be asking the ghosts to do something.
Minna: I’m fine with that. I’m fine with that. Make a bargain with them.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Is it Consort if I’m making a deal with them?
Rhi: Yeah, it depends on— it entirely depends on how you want to approach it.
Minna: It’s mostly that I don’t know if I’m allowed, mechanically, to deal with a ghost with anything other than Attune.
Rhi: Yeah, you can Consort with ghosts.
Minna: I will Consort with a ghost, then. That’s a much better roll and also what Myra’s doing.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Minna: [bursts out laughing]
Kim: What does that mean?
Minna: Three 6s. So that’s definitely a crit.
Rhi: [laughs and claps] Yep. Damn.
Minna: [laughs] Okay, so I’m gonna start off in character.
Rhi: Yeah, just tell me how you pull this off flawlessly.
Minna: Oh my… [laughs]
Rhi: I’m gonna say— hang on, let me do a quick roll to tell you how many hosts this is. Three ghosts. I think you look into the ghost field and you see three ghosts, kind of quickly surging up out of this pit.
Minna (as Myra): Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. You don’t want me, you want the guy who did this to you. He’s right up there, holding my friend. If you don’t touch her, you can have him.
Rhi: The three ghosts swivel. They all look back at this dude. They look back at you. They look at the dude. And then Blaire, I don’t know if you’re looking into the ghost field right now?
Kim: She’s probably a bit too stressed to do that right now.
Rhi: Probably, yeah. Blaire, you just feel, like, a cold rush of air go past you. There’s sort of a gurgling scream from the guy and then he lets go of you and collapses backwards.
Kim (as Blaire): Thank you! Thank you.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah. Uh, I don’t really wanna stick around. Do you—[sighs] get you back across… can you—
Rhi: Well, so you can exit through opposite ends of the tunnel, basically.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna (as Myra): Meet me topside.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, will do.
Rhi: Yeah. So Blaire, you’re able to skedaddle past this dude who is lying on the ground, twitching slightly, while his soul is devoured by three ghosts. Myra, you’re able to haul up the crate. You’ll have to collect the kids. [laughs]
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So, the three of them are doing the, like, you know, Scooby-Doo-style, like, poking their heads around in a stack to watch all of this, and their eyes are just huge.
Minna: I think Myra’s just like, storming down the passageway with a crate under one arm. And she like, just kinda like, beckons to them with one finger as she passes. Like, doesn’t even stop.
Rhi: They fall in line and they are dead silent. [laughs] Following you out. I think one of them starts to ask something and gets, like, swatted by the other two. Just like, “Don’t.”
Minna: I think as soon as they emerge topside, she turns and looks at them.
Minna (as Myra): This is serious business and I thank you for your enthusiasm. We will talk later. Go talk to Larissa.
Rhi (as Teenager): Uh huh. Yeah. Got it. Mm hmm. Yep.
Rhi: And they, like, just take off. [laughs] So, the two of you are able to meet back up and I think I want one final roll for this blackmail letter.
Minna: Yes. Is it a letter?
Rhi: I don’t know, how are you approaching the blackmail?
Minna: Yeah, are we doing it in a letter or in person?
Kim: A letter I feel as though would be the safer bet.
Minna: It is, it’s safer.
Minna (as Myra): Nuncio. You may be wondering what happened to the carrier of your latest acquisition. We intercepted him and we have it. Call off the Bluecoats, stop paying them, or we will tell them exactly where we found it and who brought it into the city.
Minna: Does that sound good?
Rhi: Yeah. I think that there’s, like, there’s some paperwork in this crate that’s kind of indicating where the different spirits are supposed to go. So you can include, like, a piece of that as kind of proof of, like, yeah, I actually have this. Yeah, go ahead and give me some kind of roll for what you’re doing here.
Minna: I feel like Command.
Rhi: Could be Command, could be Sway. Cause you’re also being manipula— you know what? This is Command.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: You’re giving an order. You are doing this, I’m gonna say this is controlled, greater effect.
Minna: Is this just me or is it a group?
Rhi: Up to you.
Kim: It can be a group thing.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I’m down with that. I can lead, if you want?
Kim: Sure, go for it.
Rhi: Yeah. Alright, so both of you go ahead and roll Command.
Kim: I rolled a 4…
Minna: Okay, so that’s okay. And I rolled a 5.
Rhi: Okay. So, I’m gonna say that you do it with a minor consequence. And I think the consequence is just gonna be you’re gonna take some extra heat on this score.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: The kids talked.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Gonna tell people what they saw.
Minna: If it wasn’t for you meddling kids!
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] I think that’s just gonna be the consequence, in addition to whatever other heat that you take, an additional plus one heat on top of that. But yeah, I think you send off this letter and Blaire presumably does something to get these ghosts to safety.
Kim: Yeah, she probably just Consorts with them until they leave.
Rhi: Well, they’re in jars if you wanna take them out into the Deathlands.
Kim: Yeah, Blaire can just take the jars. I have the load to spare.
Rhi: You send off your blackmail letter and we will see what comes of it after downtime. So, where do you wanna start with wrapping up your loose ends?
Kim: Well, where did those kids go back to? Did they go back to, um, The Haymarket Tavern, or?
Minna: We did tell them to leave us a note when they made a decision, at The Hound’s Paw. But we could go there to meet them.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that you can, you can go over to The Haymarket Tavern. And I think what you got back was basically that there were some of the kids who were interested in working with Lani and Roxanne, but most of them, Larissa included, were a lot more interested in the unionization efforts. I think that, as you said, it’s kind of, you know, you bring Larissa along as kinda the representative for your group rather than bringing eight over-excited teenagers to Belle’s doorstep. Yeah, you arranged to met with Belle Brogan. Where do you think you set up that meeting?
Minna: Even Haymarket? Like, because that is down in Belle Brogan’s area also.
Kim: Yeah, we can do that.
Rhi: Yeah. You know, you’re sitting there with Larissa. So yeah, I think the two of you— I’m imagining this is more like midday, so it’s not as many people there. Larissa is sitting at this table and is just, like, vibrating with excitement. She’s bouncing both her legs, fidgeting in her chair, keeps playing with her clothes to straighten things out.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you chill?
Rhi (as Larissa): Yes, yes! Absolutely, completely. Of course! Why wouldn’t I be?
Minna (as Myra): Because it’s a nerve-wracking thing to be meeting someone like Belle Brogan.
Rhi (as Larissa): [breathlessly] I mean, yes, she’s very well-known and she has done so much, but, I mean, I guess meeting the two of you went really well so maybe meeting her will also go really well. You should bring Minx next time. I’d like to meet her, too.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sure she’d love to meet you.
Rhi (as Larissa): She… um…
Minna: [laughs] She’s so relatable.
Rhi: She is. I mean you’re basically setting this kid up on an internship. [laughs] Yeah, so I think that the door opens and Belle comes in. As usual, she’s got a couple people with her, just because she’s such a target she can’t really go out without bodyguards. And I think Larissa, like, very abruptly stops fidgeting and sits up really straight. And Belle comes over and is just like:
Rhi (as Belle): Ah, Myra, Blaire. Good to see you again. It’s Larissa, right? Pleasure to meet you.
Rhi: And holds out her hand. And Larissa kind of is still a little frozen.
Minna (as Myra): Larissa here has been organizing some of the younger folks in this area. They’re needing a cause to point themselves at.
Rhi: I think that kind of like, jolts Larissa out of her shock and she, like, reaches out and shakes her hand and is like:
Rhi (as Larissa): I— yes, ma’am. That’s more or less what we’ve bene doing and it’s, uh, it’s an honor to mee to you, ma’am. Hi.
Rhi: And I think Belle kinda laughs and will sit down at the table and start chatting. And I think the conversation ends up being mostly between the two of them. But yeah, it sounds like Belle definitely will be able to point them in more fruitful and supervised directions.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Rather than random acts of arson.
Minna: Or random acts of following us on very dangerous heists.
Rhi: Yes. [laughs] Yeah, and so I think after that the two of you make your way back up into Nightmarket, to The Hound’s Paw, to check in before you kinda call it a day. Had a busy few days. And there is a note waiting for you and it is from one of the informants working for Briggs. And it says that, “We’re not sure what you did, but the Bluecoats have departed very abruptly. And thanks. We appreciate it.” Basically is the gist of the note. You know, Nuncio is still running his shops and his apartments. He is not financially ruined. But he did lose a lot of money when he lost his house. So, maybe in the future you’ll be able to take him on, or maybe some of the people that you’ve inspired will be able to take him down, too.

##Blooper [1.13.43]
Kim: One, one dice fell— may have fallen in my trash can.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: No! It hasn’t done anything to deserve that yet!
Kim: Yet. Where did it go?
Rhi: I know how you all roll.
Kim: Oh, okay. Oh, okay, I— swear on the force, I’m not lying. It didn’t fall in the trash can, it fell in, like, the plastic outside of the trashcan. It is face-up on a 6.
Rhi: Then keep it.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] You know that’s my policy.
Kim: I know!
Rhi: [laughs]"
"Season 3, Episode 17: The Banned Books Score Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter)
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. This intro is going to be a little shorter and possibly a little more scattered than usual. For those of you who don’t follow my personal Twitter, I recently bought my first home, which is really weird and really exciting and really stressful. I’m recording this intro earlier than usual because I’m moving this weekend, which by the time you hear this episode, will be last weekend. Time is confusing. This is also why my audio in this intro might sound a little weird; I already packed my regular recording microphone. I sound fine in the episode, don’t worry. Anyway, it’s been a wild ride and I’m really looking forward to getting settled into the new place and getting back into a regular recording schedule.
Speaking of recording, keep an eye on the Magpies Twitter and Patreon for opportunities to submit your questions. Yes, it’s that time again, when we record our end of season Q&A episode. We will be recording that very soon, so if you’ve got questions for us, make sure to watch for those posts. Next, Josie is going to share this month’s call to action.
Josie: Hey, coronavirus sucks. Donate PPE to people and institutions that need them, and also money. Support people where you live, maybe organize a rent strike or something. You can do it. Stay inside.
Rhi: Keep doing what you can to stay safe and take care of yourselves and each other, and keep demanding that our leaders and elected officials do better to ensure that everyone is cared for and supported during this crisis.
Now then, let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [00.01.55]
Rhi: So, it’s a foggy kind of rainy and damp mid-afternoon in Duskwall as we find ourselves in Silkshore. Specifically, outside the Red Lamp brothel. Normally, it would be well lit up with people entering and exiting through the very stately front doors, but today there’s only a few lights in a few of the windows. It’s very clearly closed. There are sort of black mourning drapes hanging from some of the windows. And we kinda, you know, cinematically pan through one of those windows to the lounge area on the first floor, which in contrast to the sort of dour exterior is very warm and cosy. There’s a fire crackling in the fireplace, and seated in various armchairs and couches near the fire, sharing a kettle of tea, we see Nyryx and one of her colleagues, a young woman named Golshan and the Magpies. Minx, Myra and Blaire are also seated there. And I think we kind of come in in the midst of Nyryx explaining a situation. And so, she says:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Because Madame Tesslyn didn’t have a will or any heirs, it was kind of unclear what was gonna happen to the business, and, well, none of us wanted to risk new management coming in and making things worse. So, we’ve pooled our money and I’m pretty sure that we have enough to just buy the place outright. Which is kinda terrifying now that I’m saying it out loud.
Rhi: And I think Golshan kind of like, pats her shoulder comfortingly but also looks a little freaked out.
Josie: Minx pats Nyryx’s knee.
Rhi: [laughs] She gives Minx a smile and then kinda looks to the three of you as a group and says:
Rhi (as Nyryx): So, there’s a lot that we still need to figure out, and we could use some help. I know that we don’t really have anything together yet to start working on right now, but we just wanted to see if you’d be able to help. Um, Myra I know you have helped people out with kinda contracts and papers? Is that something you think you’d be able to help us with? Because we don’t really know a lot about buying up property.
Josie (as Minx): Well, we have transferred ownership of a large building before.
Rhi: [laughs] That’s true.
Minna (as Myra): Yes, I can help you with the legal paperwork.
Josie: Minx has her hands to her cheeks and is beaming and she’s like:
Josie (as Minx): Oh, we’re accepting a job from Nyryx! This is so delightful!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And then she kinda looks to Blaire and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): And all of the kind of protective wards we had on this place were tied to Tesslyn, so if you’d be able to help with kind of resetting all of those, that would be a big help. Again, don’t—
Kim (as Blaire): I’ll get you the best on the market.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [sighs] Thanks.
Rhi: And I think she kinda glances at Minx and then looks thoughtful for a moment and is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Backrubs when I get really overwhelmed and stressed?
Josie (as Minx): Of course, dear.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: And I think Golshan, who is sitting next to her, kind of like rolls her eyes and is like:
Rhi (as Golshan): That doesn’t help me any.
Josie (as Minx): Listen, anyone who wants one of my patented backrubs can receive one.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Golshan): I’m gonna hold you to that.
Rhi: And she kinda, Golshan like, winks at you. So yeah, I think that right now they don’t really have everything that they need to kind of start on either of those big projects, they’re still sort of getting all the paperwork that they need and, you know, I think that there’s gonna have to be some specific, like, wards and things that are purchased. But they just kind of wanted to make sure that you all wanted to help with this. So, I think that you kinda hang out and chat for a little bit, talk about sort of plans. Golshan keeps talking about how Nyryx is gonna be in charge of managing things and Nyryx is like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): No, I’m not gonna be in charge, what are you talking about?
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Josie: “I’m just helping, that’s it. I’m just helping.”
Rhi (as Nyryx): I’m just helping to organize administrative things.
Rhi: And she’s like:
Rhi (as Golshan): Yeah, and you’re pretty good at it.
Rhi (as Nyryx): No, I’m not!
[laughter]
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: This has clearly been an ongoing argument. [laughs] That goes back and forth a bit. But I think eventually, you know, you all kind of come up with some plans for sort of like, okay, here’s what next steps need to happen, and agree to meet back up in a few days. And then they’ll see you to the doors and you know, Golshan kind of splits off to go check on some other things, and Nyryx tells you all goodbye, gives Minx a goodbye kiss, and the three of you will head back into Silkshore, where you’re actually spending a bit of time today.
You had several requests for appointments, for people wo wanted to meet with you over here. Nyryx was the first one. And at this point Myra kinda takes the lead and guides everyone over to the offices of the Society for Northern— let me take that again. The Society for Northern Void Sea History.
Minna: Me every time. Why did I do this to us?
Rhi: [laughs] It’s a mouthful, but it’s very good. Yeah, you make your way over there. It’s just in a, um, kind of the society offices are basically the first floor of a townhouse. And what you notice immediately upon coming up the hill towards this street, or towards this building, is that the front window of the society offices is boarded up with plywood. And as you approach the front door, you can see some little shards of broken glass still scattered on the front. Myra, in the note that you’d gotten, Kit had been very vague about why he needs to talk to you, but he did specifically ask for you to bring your friends in, and he said this in quotation marks, “Your specific line of work.” [laughs]
[laughter]
Minna: So sorry, can we run back over, this is like Kit’s house, slash the place where they meet?
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. I think, you know, you knock on the front door and it cracks open a little bit and there is a face peeking out with glasses and nice beard. Then he opens up the door and is like:
Rhi (as Kit): Oh, good, you made it. Hello again, Myra. I assume these are your, uh, friends? Colleagues?
Josie (as Minx): Uh, yes. Let’s go with colleagues. Hello, I am Minx.
Rhi (as Kit): Ah. Pleasure to meet you. Uh…
Kim (as Blaire): I’m Blaire.
Rhi (as Kit): Hello. Er, I’m Kit Sutton. I’m the head of the society here. Come on in.
Rhi: And he will lead you inside and then kinda like stops in the rather small, and now that there’s four of you in it, cramped front foyer. And then he kinda like sighs and is like:
Rhi (as Kit): Well, [sighs] it’s still a bit of a mess, but I think it’s the only room that’s big enough for all of us to meet.
Rhi: And he leads you over into the room that had the windows boarded up, which Myra, you know that this is the room that kinda has a lot of their… its sort of their library slash meeting space. There’s usually a big table or a lot of chairs in here. And when you come in, you can see that the front window has been smashed. It’s just completely shattered. There’s, you know, the glass that was apparently in on the floor has been swept up, but it kinda looks like the place has been tossed. A lot of books have been, like, knocked askew on the shelves, a few are on the floor, furniture’s been shoved out of the way. And he leads you in and kind of turns around and is like:
Rhi (as Kit): So, we’ve been robbed. [sighs]
Josie (as Minx): We had a feeling.
Minna (as Myra): What did they take?
Rhi (as Kit): Uh, yes. Well, uh… the good news, as much as there can be good news in a situation like this, is that I am almost certain who did it. What they took were several rare volumes, first editions, and a few that are… not strictly approved for ownership by the Emperor. One could say.
Minna (as Myra): Banned books.
Rhi (as Kit): Yes, yes. Um… they are valuable to understanding the history of the region, but owning them is technically illegal.
Minna (as Myra): I understand.
Rhi (as Kit): And… well, about a week ago, um, this woman and her guards came to visit. She’s an antiquities dealer who’s visiting from the Imperial City. And she enquired about purchasing some of my rarer tomes, and I said that nothing here was for sale. That it was for the education and benefit of the public, that she was welcome to visit and borrow things and read them here, invited her to our next presentation, which is now going to have to be delayed… in any case, she at the time seemed to accept the rejection very graciously and left, but then a few days ago…
Rhi: He just kind of gestures at the room.
Josie (as Minx): I see. Is it simply a matter of reclaiming what was taken, or further preventative measures?
Rhi (as Kit): At this point I think— well. Ooh. Oh, I hadn’t even thought about that.
Kim (as Blaire): Because we can do both. If you wanna dish out vengeance, we can do that.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh, I don’t— I don’t… vengeance is… I just—[sighs] I want my property back and I don’t want it stolen again. I’m not sure how long she’s planning on being in the city and it would be awfully inconvenient if you all stole the books back only for her to steal them again.
Josie: Well, perhaps we could hold onto the books until she leaves town and then simply return them?
Rhi (as Kit): That… that could work. I may need to visit to borrow one if I need it for notes and my research, but that could work.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Because we do have some secure locations to keep such a thing. And you would know exactly whose hands they were in and when and where, if you don’t trust us for whatever reason.
Rhi (as Kit): Oh. I mean… well, I don’t know the two of you—
Rhi: And he kind of gestures to Minx and Blaire.
Rhi (as Kit): —very well, but um…
Minna: Are you implying that Kit trusts Myra? [laughs]
Rhi: Well, he’s getting there. He’s like:
Rhi (as Kit): Myra has been a very supportive member of our group and is helping us branch out into further publications. And I, after Myra told me a bit about the work that you all do, I did research, as is my wont, and it seems that we may have very, very radically different approaches to the problem, but I think that we agree that there is a great problem of inequality and oppression and misinformation in our society. And I am attempting to tackle it from one angle, and you are tackling it from a very different angle. But I think that you mean well.
Minna (as Myra): Different paths up the same mountain.
Rhi (as Kit): Yes, that’s a very poetic way of putting it.
Josie (as Minx): Mm hmm. Do you wish us to leave a calling card? Would you like to be known to be under our protection, or…?
Rhi (as Kit): Oh. Um. Hmm. I think perhaps not? Uh, I do try to, the banned booked aside, keep everything here as above-board as possible. And while I do appreciate the work that you are doing, your reputation in some of the, uh, parts of society that I need to appeal to for funding is… less than stellar.
Josie (as Minx): Fair enough. I will figure out another way to be dramatic in our exit.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): What can you tell us about this person?
Rhi (as Kit): Ah, yes. Her name is Nadra Khuran. She’s originally from Iruvia, but has lived in Imperial City for quite some time. We spent like an hour chatting over tea. It’s really disheartening to think that she would have done this, but I can’t imagine who else would have.
In any event, she works for a trading house that deals mostly in antiquities in Imperial City. She’s in Duskwall for some amount of time looking to make purchases. I believe she’s staying in Nightmarket, from what she said. And that’s… she gave me a specific list of titles that she had heard I owned that she was interested in. I told her, obviously, that they were not for sale. And then those exact tomes, plus a few extras, went missing.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Kit): Yes. So, it seems to me to be a rather clear line of who would be behind this. If not her, then perhaps someone working with her. And I couldn’t report this to the authorities, because they would ask me what was stolen. And if, in the course of investigating, they turned up my illegal books, that would have done me more harm than good. So…
Josie (as Minx): Fair enough. And is it known in your specialized community that you were in possession of these, or did you only make that known to people who come to ask, like her?
Rhi (as Kit): The first editions are known more publicly that we have those. Researchers will often come here to access our library. The more questionable books, I do not advertise those as much. I keep them locked up in the back.
Rhi: And he kinda gestures towards a door behind him that it’s obvious the lock, the doorknob on it, has just been, like, smashed off. Somebody just kicked the door down.
Rhi (as Kit): I keep them locked up in the back, and I, you know, tend to reserve those for people who I know I can trust. I had not told her about those, so I suspect that they may have gone looking, or she may have gained information some other way. I’m not sure.
Josie (as Minx): I see. So, that should make this pretty cut and dry, then.
Rhi (as Kit): [sighs] I sincerely hope so. I just want to get my library set to rights. This is very depressing.
Rhi: [laughs] He just kind of looks around at his bookshelves very sadly.
Josie (as Minx): And I take it Myra here might have increased privileges to some time if this task is done?
Rhi (as Kit): Oh, um, certainly yes, if you would like. I mean, any of you, if you are interested in historical research, you would be more than welcome to access our libraries and our texts.
Kim (as Blaire): [excited] Really?
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Kit): Yes.
Minna: [squeals] Blaire! [whispers] She hasn’t had access to a library…
Josie: Aww! [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): No— I— I just wanna make this clear… I’m allowed in your library?
Josie (as Minx): She is banned from every public library and quite a few private ones.
Kim (as Blaire): All the private ones!
Rhi (as Kit): Um…
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Kit): Can I… before I… perhaps I should take this a step back. Before I just say yes, you are welcome here, why were you banned from other libraries?
Kim (as Blaire): I got too into banned books.
[prolonged laughter]
Rhi: Oh my God. Holy shit.
Kim: It’s true!
Rhi: It is! She’s just not saying why they were banned. [laughs]
Rhi (as Kit): Oh. Um, I see. Well, I mean, I can’t exactly fault you for that. So, yes, you would be welcome to visit here. We don’t allow you to take any books off the premises, but—
Kim (as Blaire): Of course not.
Rhi (as Kit): You’d be able to come here and do research.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm hmm. Thank you so much!
Rhi: [laughs] I had forgotten that particular detail of Blaire’s backstory.
Minna: I had not, because I had silently vowed to find Blaire a library to browse.
Rhi: Oh my God.
Kim: Oh my God, a whole new world has just opened up to me. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh, that’s hilarious. I don’t know how much here is going to be of interest to Blaire, because it’s a pretty narrow focus. [laughs] But…
Josie: There’s books. It’s of interest. [laughs]
Kim: Yup. And trust me, one of these days I’m gonna roll a critical during Gather Info and it’s just gonna be like, “Oh, there’s a demon tome that was hidden behind cobwebs that people had forgotten about!” And yeah.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. Oh man, it was just—
Kim: That’s how it’s gonna happen.
Rhi: Yeah. So, yeah, that’s what Kit is kind of able to tell you initially. If you all wanna start Gathering Info, you can ask Kit some more questions or you can kinda head out into the city to start looking for some books.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah, I’m down to start gathering info.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: Although as they’re leaving, I think Minx has a question for the other Magpies and is like:
Josie (as Minx): So, why are books banned? I understand banning certain weapons, but… in the end, it’s just a book. It’s not going to hurt anyone.
Kim (as Blaire): No, but the information inside of it could.
Minna (as Myra): Knowledge is power. And The Imperium very strictly controls… well, what is known.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, but in the end, only, like, a certain sort of person is even gonna be interested in any given book. Is it really that much of an issue?
Minna (as Myra): Look at what Blaire’s done with her own book knowledge.
[pause]
Josie (as Minx): That…
Kim (as Blaire): [grumbles]
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): That is a fair point.
[laughter]
Rhi: Damn.
Josie (as Minx): You know what? That completely sells me. Anyway—
Kim (as Blaire): Wow!
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Wow, you guys.
Rhi: Roasted.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Wow.
Minna (as Myra): I’m just— I’m only pointing out that knowledge does allow you to see things that others do not.
Kim (as Blaire): I was gonna suggest that it was an overabundance of caution and paranoia, but alright, it’s pick on Blaire day!
Minna: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): I wasn’t picking on you. I admire your knowledge.
Josie (as Minx): I do pick on you a little bit.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, I know you do.
Rhi: That was great. So, where do you all wanna start with Gathering Info? You have a name.
Josie: Well, if she’s an antiquities dealer, I imagine she might be visiting the local antiquities sellers. I think I wanna check in my high society connections to see if there’s, like, any events coming up.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Like symposiums, or like, trade shows or an Antiques Roadshow or something.
Rhi: [laughs] Oh my God. I just had a flash of what a Duskwall setting Antiques Roadshow would be. And the number of genuinely haunted objects, of like, “Well this doll belonged to my grandmother.” “Yes, and now your grandmother belongs to the doll. Please take this away.”
[laughter]
Kim: [sings tune] Haunted Doll Watch.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: But the goal being I wanna pin down something she might go to, so we can hit her place while she’s out.
Rhi: Ah, gotcha, gotcha. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So, does somebody else wanna go chat with Fitz while Minx is doing that?
Minna: I like Fitz.
Rhi: Okay. Blaire do you have a specific idea for what you wanna do, or do you wanna tag along with Myra?
Kim: I might tag along with Myra… hmm. But I’m wondering if it makes more sense to, you know, cover more ground and do my own thing by, you know, reading a book. As usual.
Rhi: [laughs] You could. Or you could stake out her house. Not her house, but she’s basically doing an Airbnb ting. She’s renting a town home for a long period of time.
Kim: Okay. Yeah, let me do that.
Rhi: Yeah, okay. So let’s then… hmm… let’s start with Minx. And you’re checking in on your high society folks. Finding out about any nerd get-togethers.
Josie: [laughs] I’m rolling Consort there, and I got a 5.
Rhi: 5, okay. So, um, yeah, I think that you ask around. And you have to kind of go, like… I think the immediate circle of people that you hang out with in sort of the noble high society groups, they also are not really the sort of people that would go to these types of events.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: But it’s kind of like, “Oh I have a friend who mentioned something,” or “My brother mentioned something.” I think actually the Church of Ecstasy is having like, a— it’s not an auction. It’s like an exhibition of artifacts and relics and things.
Josie: So this is like, pure showing off your status.
Rhi: Yeah. And like, generally stuff is not openly for sale, but it’s kind of an understood open secret that if you show up with enough money, they are willing to part with things. Because ultimately, if it’s something that they’re putting on display, it’s not that important to them.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: And they would rather have the money. So, that’s coming up in, um, a few days. You know, as usual, a sufficient amount of time for you all to prepare. And it sounds like the kind of thing that, you know, this antiquities dealer would be interested in.
Josie: Okay. Oh, is it invitation only?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, it’s gonna be a pretty exclusive sort of thing.
Josie: Interesting. Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, you would probably have to do some deeper digging if you wanted to confirm that she’s on the invite list. That would be a different avenue. But you could do that if you wanted to be, like, extra sure she’s going.
Josie: Yeah. I’m wondering if that’s better if that’s like a set-up action to the score, or as part of the score?
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: But I’m thinking like, if she isn’t invited…
Rhi: Get her an invitation?
Josie: Forging an— yes.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. Yeah, I think… yeah. We’ll circle back to that. Because you’ll have to talk to some different people to make that happen. But I think that totally makes sense. Alright, so let’s go to Myra next and your visit with Fitz.
Minna: Alright, so she walks into Fitz’s place.
Rhi: It is, as usual, a scene of organized chaos. And I think it’s been a while since you all have visited. And so, I think when he finally spots you, he does like a visible double take and is like:
Rhi (as Fitz): Wow. Uh… I kind of thought you were dead.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna (as Myra): Don’t you read the newspapers?
Rhi (as Fitz): Uh, I mean sometimes I glance at it when I’m using it to wrap up sculptures. That’s mostly what it’s good for these days. What do you need? I assume that’s the only reason you’re dropping in.
Minna (as Myra): Uh, yes. Um, there is a specific antiques dealer we’re trying to get ahold of, and we thought maybe you would have heard of her.
Rhi: Gimme a roll and let’s find out. [laughs]
Minna: I got a 4.
Rhi: So, are you looking for information about Nadra, or are you trying to find antiquities dealers that she might have talked to?
Minna: Um, I think I wanna know about Nadra.
Rhi: Okay. So, yeah, I think what he tells you is that he has… he’s met with her. He says that sort of what he’s been hearing from a lot of his associates who work in similar fields is that she;s just been like, working the circuit. Like, anybody who might deal in antiquities, she’s been talking to. She’s been very busy out and about in the city.
He did not really have much that she was interested in, because again, he tends to focus on art. She did buy, like, a sculpture from him. Like an Iruvian sculpture. But you know, it was old enough to qualify as an antique but he’s not sure if it’s valuable enough that she picked it up, like, for her trading house she works for, or if it was just something that she liked for herself. What kinda information do you wanna get out of him? So you can kinda ask some follow-up questions specifically about her or her business?
Minna: Like, does she seem to have a specific, like, area of interest? Is there any reason that she’s grabbing so much stuff right now?
Rhi: Oh, okay. So, area of interest, it just seems to be she’s kind of trying to buy up anything that might be valuable for resale in Imperial City, which is where, you know, a lot of the… if you think the upper crust in Duskwall is bad… [laughs]
Minna: Yeah, try Imperial City.
Rhi: But she’s not buying up everything. She actually seems to be focusing on stuff that is pretty high end. She definitely has— she’s asking about a lot of stuff. She is focusing her attention in on stuff that’s either very expensive or stuff that is specifically Iruvian. She seems to be looking to buy Iruvian artifacts that have ended up in Duskwall.
Minna: Do we know the nature of the books that she— I guess they’re probably all sorts, but mostly, you know, not Iruvian?
Rhi: So, most of them would just be— most of the books that were taken, because I think Kit was able to give you a list of what was stolen.
Minna: I imagine, given the focus of the society, it’s probably mostly Skovlan and Akoros.
Rhi: Mostly, yes. But what was interesting was that a few of the kind of first editions and a couple of the banned books did have to do with the formation of the empire and specifically how Iruvia came into the Empire. And the thing with Iruvia, and I think this is something Myra would 100% know, Blaire if she paid attention in history classes would probably know—
Kim: Which she did.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx might not really know this cause of just the, you know, lack of formal education and not a ton of interest in history. But basically when, you know, the Cataclysm happened, the Immortal Emperor appeared, promising to save everyone from the horrors that had been unleashed on the land. And he started kind of pulling the Empire together. And Iruvia was basically, in every way that would matter in this sort of equation, economically and militarily, was pretty much the equal of Akoros.
And what ended up happening was, you know, Iruvia was one of the few nations that elected to join the Empire willingly. Because their leaders at the time did the math and realized that they could hold off Akoros, but Akoros would never stop. And so, eventually they would just be worn down. They would lose the war eventually. And it was just a question of how many people do we want to die before it’s over. So, they just decided to join willingly. And that has granted them privileges that countries like Skovlan don’t get.
They are allowed a fair amount of kind of autonomous rule. They’ve kept a lot of their culture. And like, they’re technically part of the Empire, but everybody knows that they’re mostly just sorta doing their own thing. And there’s always been kind of some rumblings within Iruvian society of wanting to split off from the Empire. It’s never gone anywhere. The people in power benefit from their relationship to The Empire. But there’s always kinda that undercurrent. And it’s the sorta thing where if they decided to leave, it would be a very costly war to bring them back.
So, that’s kinda the situation with Iruvia. And a lot of that information, particularly the… the official history of Iruvia joining the Empire is that, you know, it was this, you know, the wise leaders made this decision for the betterment of both peoples to join The Empire and strengthen it, yadda, yadda, yadda. Some of the books that were stolen have… like, they are accounts from that time and talk about how actually, like, messy and bloody— like, there were assassinations, there were bribes, there was a lot of really, you know… politics. This was the, you know, it was a lot messier than the history books paint it. Than the official histories do. So, some of those books were taken as well.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: Yeah. So I think that, kind of between talking to Fitz and what you got from Kit earlier, you’re kind of able to piece together that she seems to have a particular interest in either stuff that’s very expensive or Iruvian history. So, Blaire.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: You are staking out the townhouse, right?
Kim: yes. Um, let me… roll Survey.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: If I can find that on my sheet. It’s been actual years.
Rhi: Yeah. She’s just got a nice, like, three-story brick townhouse. Fairly new building. Kinda near one of the big market areas.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 4.
Rhi: So, what kind of information do you wanna try and get from your observation of her place?
Kim: I’m basically trying to get an idea of her daily comings and goings so that way, you know, we can scope out routes if we decide to infiltrate. Well, when we decide to infiltrate, I should say.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that you get over there pretty early in the morning, just to make sure. There’s like a little café out in the market area when you can post up and watch her place. And she leaves not super, super early in the morning, but kind of like… if most libraries and, you know, art collectors and things like that, if they mostly open at 9, she leaves at about 9.30.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: I think what you notice is that she has a pair of guards with her. The guards are also both Iruvian and based on their, like— Blaire, I think that you out of the three of you have probably spent the most time kind of by the embassies. Which isn’t to say you’ve spent a lot of time there, but you did have to go over to the Tycherosi Embassy a couple times as a student, just kinda to get paperwork sorted.
Kim: Right, yeah.
Rhi: So, you recognize that what the guards are wearing is basically the uniform of the guards who are posted at the Iruvian Embassy.
Minna: Mm.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: Which is weird. [laughs] You know, officially, she is a citizen of the Imperial City. So, it’s a little odd that she’s being escorted around by Iruvian Embassy guards.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: But, you know, she leaves with two of them at like, 9.30 in the morning, and then seems to be gone, like, all day. You don’t see her come back until probably about 5 o’clock at night. Like, she’s back home for a couple hours, then she will come out again with a different set of guards. Like, it seems like they— which, to you, there’s probably guards stationed inside, keeping an eye on the place. And she’s wearing, you know, party clothes. She’s dressed up to go to a more formal event. And then leaves and then I think, you know, you’ve been there since dawn. I think you probably give up around 10 o’clock at night, where you’re just like, “I have been sitting watching this house for 15 hours.” [laughs]
Kim: Yup.
Rhi: Fortunately, it’s in Nightmarket, so it’s a short walk home and then you can pass out. But basically, it seems like she’s gone all day and then goes out again at night. So, it seems like she’s just out a lot on the day that you observed her. And she did come back, when she came home that day her guards and her were carrying various packages. So, it looks like she’s actively going out and buying up a lot of stuff.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: That is what you are able to observe. Any other info that anybody would like to gather at this point?
Josie: I have no idea how I would gather knowing if she’s on the guest list or not?
Rhi: You know that it’s being run by the church. If you can talk to somebody who’s going, which I think you would have been able to get the names of some people who are going, you might be able to have them kinda try and find that out on your behalf?
Josie: Sure…
Rhi: Yeah, so I think this would probably be another Consort or Sway.
Josie: Yeah. Like, and I think my angle is I have been wanting to talk to someone from Imperial City.
Rhi: Mm, yeah.
Josie: Five again.
Rhi: Yeah, I think that you are able to find out that she has been invited to this event in a couple days’ time, and your contact asks if you would also, if you want an invitation.
Josie: To allay suspicion, yes.
Rhi: [laughs] And who knows, like, listen. You might be able to use it for a future forgery. Why not?
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Yeah, so yeah, I think you get handed a very nice, elegant invitation with all of the symbols of the Church of Ecstasy on it. I don’t know what those symbols are, I don’t wanna think about it too hard.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: But yeah. So, you know that in a couple days’ time, she’s guaranteed, no matter what, to be out of the house at a given time.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: So, yeah.
Josie: That’s great.
Rhi: Yes. So, I’m guessing this is a stealth score?
Kim: Sounds like it.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. Just a good ol’ classic breaking into a house. How do you want to attempt to get in?
Josie: What is the layout again? It’s just kind of a town home?
Rhi: Yeah, it’s a— I think it’s a, like… so, there’s a particular set of really gorgeous brick townhomes in the neighborhood that my college was in, that they’re all like, they’re individual homes, but it’s kind of all one big brick building that runs together.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: And that’s what I’m picturing. Is that it’s, you know, each individual home is a three-story place, but it’s a, you know, probably like ten or twelve townhomes in this one building.
Josie: Gotcha. And those usually do have, like, a small yard space in back, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah. I think this might just be a fuckin’ go in the back sort of situation.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. That is definitely a solid entry point. Okay.
Josie: Don’t take that out of context.
Rhi: [laughs] So, for the Engagement Roll, one for luck. “Is this operation particularly bold or daring?”
Josie: No?
Minna: I guess not, given our usual shit.
Josie: This is pretty standard for us.
Kim: Yeah, this is tame.
Rhi: Yeah, and you have guaranteed that, you know, she’s not gonna be at the house. You’ve taken steps to do that. So, yeah. I think so. “Does the plan’s detail expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they’re weakest?” I think the fact that you have arranged for her to be guaran— you’ve ensured that she’s out of the house. It’s gonna give you an advantage there.
Josie: Okey dokey.
Rhi: Friends or contacts have given you insight. Nobody’s interfering… yet.
Josie: Good to know. [laughs]
Rhi: So, this is gonna be a 3d6 Engagement Roll. Oh no.
Josie: Oh.
Kim: That sounds like a 1.
Rhi: It sounds like a 1, 2, 3. [laughs]
Kim: Mm…
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: Oh no!
Kim: So, the best we got is a 3?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, literally I rolled 3 dice and they came up 1, 2, 3.
Josie: Mm.
Rhi: I think that it’s, you know, the night of this symposium. I think we get a shot of the sanctorium all lit up. People, you know, fine carriages pulling up outside, people in beautiful clothes stepping out. There’s food and drink and music and it’s a great big fancy party. And then we kind of swipe across the city to Nightmarket, to this row of townhouses. And we see The Magpies, geared up, making their way down the alley. You hear, like, raised voices and, you know:
Rhi (as Voice): Hands on your head, don’t move! Put the gun down!
Rhi: And you get closer and you can see—
Josie: I think Minx instinctively raises her hands real quick before realizing it’s not talking to her.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Yeah, Blaire slaps it down.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And you all, like, kinda creep a little bit closer, peering out from behind a dumpster or something, and you can see there’s a bunch of Bluecoats, there’s like a Bluecoat paddy wagon in the back alley, there’s a bunch of Bluecoats in the yard of Nadra’s rented home. And there’s lights on in the place, the Bluecoats are moving through the space, and you can see them leading some people out in handcuffs.
Josie (as Minx): I see. Alright dears, new plan. Um… the load includes banned books, correct?
Kim (as Blaire): Correct.
Josie (as Minx): And knowing The Bluecoats, they’re gonna be looting around in there for stuff they can take. As, you know, payment for their services. I say we wait and see if they find the banned books and snatch it from them. On their way out.
Kim (as Blaire): Let them do the work for us.
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): I like it.
Rhi: I think the first roll that I’m gonna need here is for you all to hide well enough.
Josie: Uh huh. A group Prowl, everyone?
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Yup. I think so.
Rhi: Yeah. Who is leading that?
Josie: I only have one stress.
Minna: I have none. I can lead.
Josie: Cool.
Rhi: Alright. So, everybody go ahead and make those rolls. These are also— these are desperate, so make sure you mark XP.
Josie: Oh, yay.
Minna: I rolled a 6.
Kim: Oh!
Josie: I got a 2. [laughs]
Kim: Um… I got a 1. That goes in the dice bin.
Minna: So, take two points of stress but we do it without consequence.
Rhi: Yeah. So, Myra, explain how you— you find a great hiding spot and keep— what is the narrow escape that you keep Minx and Blaire form getting caught? Cause I think it’s a situation where they almost get seen and you’re able to cover for them. So, where’s your hideout?
Minna: They’re about to, like, try and dart to the next shadow to try and find a better hiding spot, and I’ve literally just spotted an alcove. And I, like, yoink them back by the scruff of their necks, basically.
Rhi: So, okay. So, the three of you settle in to wait for this to happen. I think you can kind of hear the probably familiar sounds of, you know, people being loaded into this, into the paddy wagon. You can hear the Bluecoats are talking to one of the guards, getting a statement. I’m gonna make a fortune roll to determine what they grab and if they get the stuff that you want.
Okay, so I rolled a 6. What is to your advantage? That they find the stuff and you grab it from them, or that they don’t find the stuff and you can try and get it from the house. What is more advantageous for you? Cause that 6 means, to me, that the situation shakes out in a way that is best for you.
Josie: I think it’s best if they don’t find it and we get to go in and do it anyway.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Agreed.
Minna: But we have to know that they didn’t find it, somehow.
Rhi: I mean, I think, kinda regardless, you were gonna have to go into the house to check.
Minna: Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
Rhi: But this will just, yeah, this will that tell us that it’s actually there. And I think that if they had taken the stuff, the score would have been get into the house, find it’s not there, chase down The Bluecoats…
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: It would have added an additional layer of complication which now you don’t have to worry about. So, I think that you kinda have to hang out in this alcove for, like, an hour while The Bluecoats collect the criminals, get statements and evidence and then, as predicted, do a little rummaging of their own. They don’t do as much because this is somebody who is pretty highly connected and they can’t get away with it as much.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Kim: Mm.
Rhi: But you know, a few things are gonna walk out the door. Yeah, but eventually after, like— I imagine this is not, like— it’s not a big space, you can’t really sit down, you can’t really walk around, so just kind of that shifting your weight and just waiting in silence. But eventually, you hear the last Bluecoat wagon clatter away down the alley, and then you wait and everything seems to be quiet. Poke your heads out and the alley is empty. Most of the lights in the townhouse are out. There is a light on still up on the second floor. Cause there are guards posted here. But otherwise, things seem to have finally quieted down.
Josie: Can we tell how the previous thieves entered?
Rhi: [laughs] Um, oh man. I think…. I think you can see that there is a— so like, when you creep around to the back door, there’s like a storm cellar or root cellar kinda doors that have a, like, a fresh— cause you know, this is something that’s outside. The weather would normally damage it some. This is, like, a fresh chain and padlock on the storm cellar doors.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: So, it seems like they tried to go in that way, alerted somebody somehow, and got caught.
Josie: Okay. So let’s not do that.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, what is your approach here?
Josie: Um…
Rhi: This is hilarious. These poor fucking guards. [laughs] “Ah, we have the defused the crime. Now we can relax— oh fuck.”
Josie: [laughs] I kinda want to do a window.
Minna: Windows are classics.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah. Windows work.
Josie: And also, what Rhi just said kinda gave me an idea.
Minna: Ooh.
Kim: Uh oh.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah?
Josie: I kinda wanna just be like… [laughs] find the guards and be like, “Listen. Do you really wanna deal with this twice? We’re only after a specific thing.” [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. Yeah.
Josie: Maybe brandish a gun at them at the same time and be like, “Listen.” [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. I… that’s really good.
Kim: That works.
Rhi: So yeah, so where do you want to— what window do you want to enter? You’ve got basically first, second or third floor. Obviously, you know, it’s gonna be— climbing in the first floor window will not require any rolls, because it’s just opening a window. Second or third you’re gonna have to, you know, do some work to get up there.
Josie: I think the second story one is less likely to have security, so let’s do that.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so gonna have to climb up there somehow.
Josie: Yeah. Well, I mean, we have rope and stuff, right?
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, if somebody marks climber’s… what is it?
Josie: Climbing gear.
Rhi: Yeah. How does this game work? [laughs]
Josie: I can do that thing.
Minna: I could feel you reaching for the D&D version.
Rhi: [laughs] Yep. Climber’s kit? Nope. That’s incorrect.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Climbing gear.
Josie: Climbing gear, yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, climbing gear. Yeah. Okay, yeah, so if you mark that then yeah, I think you’ll just need to make a roll to get up there safely and quietly.
Josie: Maybe I can lead a group Prowl or something?
Rhi: So yeah, everybody go ahead. I think at this point the situation is back to just risky.
Kim: I got a 4.
Minna: 4.
Rhi: … 5, okay. [laughs] So, you do it but there’s a consequence. So, Minx I think you are first up the rope. And there’s— so, there’s a couple windows on the second floor. One of them has lights on. You obviously don’t wanna go in there, because you’re guessing that’s probably where the guards are at. So, you get the rope up to the other window. You climb up. You, you know, get the window open. And Minx, you climb in through the window and step inside just as the door opens and the light clicks on and one of the guards walks in. It seems you have climbed into her bedroom.
Josie: I see. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] So, you’re standing there in front of the window with a rope. She is standing in the doorway with a sword.
Josie: Oh, she is.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. Not out, just, you know, you both look equally surprised. [laughs] And I think she does in fact go:
Rhi (as Guard): Oh fuck, not again.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And goes to draw— and she’s going to draw her sword. So, you can react-
Josie: I’m going to draw pistol. [laughs]
Minna: This is your chance for a homoerotic swordfight. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Oh, right. No, yeah, you’re right. Never mind. I draw my sword.
Minna and Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: There you go.
Rhi: Listen. Thank you, Minna, thank you for picking up what I was putting down. [laughs] Yeah, so Minx draws a sword and… go ahead and roll it. [laughs]
Josie: How gay do I wanna make this?
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: Oh, completely.
Josie: [laughs] Okay. I think I want to… I think I want to engage, but not strike at her. I think Minx is gonna deliberately move into the swords crossed pose.
Rhi: [laughs] Um… yeah, give me some kind of a roll. It does not necessarily have to be Skirmish, because I feel like you’re also flirting.
Josie: Listen, its either Skirmish or Sway and I have four dots in both, so…
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, well, the action you chose is gonna tell me how she responds to it. [laughs] So, take it away.
Josie: Oh, then I’m gonna do it with Sway. [laughs]
Minna: Hell. Yes.
Josie: I wanna make an impression.
Rhi: Yep. Oh my God.
Josie: Cause this is definitely the time to do that, Minx.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Josie: I got a 5. [laughs]
Rhi: You do it, but there’s a consequence. [laughs] So, I think it’s one of those, like, you move in and you lock swords and lock eyes.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: [laughs] And, uh, I think that there is a moment where it’s like, okay, you both are like, “Ah. We see what’s happening here.”
Josie: Uh huh. [laughs]
Rhi: And then her partner, the other guard, comes in.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And is just like:
Rhi (as Second Guard): What the hell is going— oh shit, are there more of them?
Rhi: I think as, like, Myra’s head is poking up over the window. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, the consequence is that, for the moment, your homoerotic swordfight is being delayed by the presence of another guard and your compatriots.
Josie: God dammit. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] So, Myra, you’re climbing into the room. That is the tableau before you. What do you wanna do?
Minna: My heart says throw something at the guard that just came in, but I don’t know why that’s what my heart is saying.
Rhi: Hey… you know, do whatever.
Minna: Just grab the closest thing to hand and like, fucking throw it.
Rhi: Yeah. Go with it.
Minna: Um… what the fuck is… that a Skirmish?
Rhi: Probably, yeah.
Minna: It’s a 5.
Rhi: 5. Okay. So, again, you do it but there’s a consequence. So, I think that you scramble in and, like, grab a vase off of a little table that’s near the window and hurl it at this guy. And he, like, brings an arm up and kind of swats it away, but it still shatters. So, he is injured. Like, the shards of pottery cut up his arm a bit. But it did not take him out of the fight. So basically, you had reduced effect. And uh, [laughs] so Blaire, as you’re the last one coming up the rope, you’ve heard shouting, the sound of swords crossing, and then shattering pottery as you climb into the room.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: What do you wanna do?
Kim: [sighs] Is it knife time? Do I throw a knife at someone?
Minna: [excited]
Kim: Blaire’s— Blaire’s not— historically I know how this goes. Blaire’s not a fighty, stabby… but…
Rhi: I mean, if Blaire and Myra take the one guard and Minx takes the other.
Kim: Yeah. Yeah, let me try throwing a knife at the one guard that isn’t engaged with Minx.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: It doesn’t matter. 4 and 1.
Rhi: Okay. No, a 4 is, a 4 means you do it.
Kim: Not well!
Rhi: There’s just also a conse— it means there’s a consequence. So, I think what happens is he sees you take out the— you whip out your throwing knife, and he basically does the same and the blades just, like, cross each other. They pass each other in the air. So, you catch him in the shoulder, but you also are gonna get hit.
Kim: That’s fine.
Rhi: I think it’s gonna be… let’s see, this is risky. So, I think it’s gonna be level 2 harm.
Kim: Okay. Level 2, stabbed?
Rhi: Uh, yeah. I think it’s gonna be like, it catches you kind of in the hip. So, anything that’s sort of like climbing or running, you’re gonna be at a penalty on. You can roll to resist it if you’d like to reduce that. Or you can have armor. We always forget about armor. But you can have armor.
Kim: Yeah, you know what? It was Needle who told me about armor, too. So let me mark off armor and put that to level 1.
Rhi: Yeah. So that’ll just be, yeah, instead of it being a pretty bad gash, stab across the hip, you just kind of have a little graze.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: It stings, but it’s not gonna impede you as much. Okay. [laughs] This has turned into… these poor guards. [laughs] They were just, they were— they’ve already had a night.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: They’re getting robbed a second time in one night. In five years, this’ll be a great story for them to tell.
Josie: Yes. [laughs]
Rhi: Minx, you are still blade to blade with your guard here.
Josie: I think I want to hold that and try to talk them down from this position.
Rhi: Okay, yeah.
Josie: Minx is gonna say:
Josie (as Minx): Now, dears. As much I would love to continue this dance, it does seem both of our groups are in a bit of a rough spot tonight, and I would hate to mar your beautiful face. Although I can probably finagle a scar to match mine.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): What— we’re after something very specific, and you can blame it on the previous group. What do you say we all make this an easier night for both of us?
Rhi: Risky position, reduced effect. They are pretty committed to their jobs, so…
Josie: I’m going to push myself to increase effect.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: And I’m gonna roll Sway.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: Got a 6.
Rhi: So, I think that the guards both have swords up, are kinda eyeing the situation, and then they sort of look at each other and exchange, just like, that silent communication look. And then the woman doesn’t, like, lower her sword, but her stance relaxes slightly. Where like, she’s still, if you try something, she will be ready to go. But she’s not, like, actively preparing to stab you. And the guy says:
Rhi (as Guard): You’re gonna have to make it worth our while.
Josie: Hmm. Well, I have…
Josie: Shit, I always forget to take stuff out of my stash to have coin on my person.
Rhi: I’ll allow that as a flashback.
Josie: Sure. Yeah.
Josie: I believe 2 coin is worth an off night, what do you say?
Rhi: Are you offering them 2 coin apiece, or 2 coin total?
Josie: Oh. Yeah, that’s a good point. I have 2 coin.
Rhi: Okay. So, you’re offering 1 coin apiece.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Which, like, I mean, that’s nothing to sneeze at. One coin is a week’s wages for your average worker. So like, you know, you’re offering them not an insignificant chunk of change.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Josie (as Minx): And how about this. You both keep an eye on me in this room as collateral while my compatriots retrieve the item?
Rhi: I think there’s another one of those, they exchange glances again, and then the woman says:
Rhi (as Guard): I’ll keep an eye on you here and Crow here will keep an eye on the two of them to make sure that you walk off with nothing more than— what are you after? God, why does everyone pick tonight to break in?
Josie (as Minx): Well, it seems the mistress of the manor is absent. She recently came into possession of some books that don’t belong to her.
Rhi (as Guard): [sighs] I knew we shouldn’t have taken… it’s fine. Yeah. Okay. You’re stealing back the books that got stolen. That wasn’t the two of us. That was the other half of the guard detail. She really wanted those books.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Guard): Yeah.
Josie: I think at that, Minx will back off and do a little flourish with her sword before sheathing it and sitting on the bed. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. She will— she doesn’t put the sword away, but she will lower it. And Crow is just sort of like… I think he gives her a very, like, pointed look of like:
Rhi (as Crow): Keep an eye on her.
Rhi (as Guard): I will.
Rhi: And so then he gestures for Myra and Blaire to go out ahead of him.
Josie: I would like to suggest that we don’t check back in with—
Rhi: Mm hmm. [laughs]
Josie: Minx and the guard until after everything else is already done and the other two return.
Minna: Oh, yes.
Kim: That works for me.
Rhi: Okay. So, Myra and Blaire. You basically, like, now this is the kind of now the easiest heist you’ve ever done, because you are being escorted to where the goods are. Crow will— he is also keeping his blade out and he leads you to the, kind of, the end of the hall where there is a door that is locked. He unlocks the door and will walk you upstairs to the attic, which is stuffed with stuff. Arcane— not arcane, um, just various antiquities, and there’s a lot of books, there’s a lot of stuff in crates. And he’s just like:
Rhi (as Crow): Everything’s been put up here. You’re gonna have to do some searching.
Rhi: And then he’ll just kind of gesture for you to have at it.
Kim: Okay.
Minna: Well, we’ve got a list.
Rhi: Yeah, you do have a list of the specific titles that you’re looking for.
Minna: Uh, if we see any books that we’re particularly interested in that are not on the list, he doesn’t have to know.
Kim: Or valuables, since we never make money.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: We did only mention that she stole books.
Rhi: Yeah, and they seem to be familiar with the job, so if you try to— there is— I’m not saying it would be impossible for you to lift some books that aren’t on your list—
Minna: You know, why risk it?
Rhi: Yeah, there is a possibility that you would get caught.
Kim: Okay, true.
Rhi: So yeah, you can— this is gonna be a controlled position and you can make whatever rolls you want to start searching the place.
Minna: I’m gonna Study about it.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: And that’s a 6.
Kim: Nice.
Rhi: So, you’re not gonna get all of them in one go. There’s a lot of books and they’re not necessarily all together. But I think, hang on, let me… Myra, you find two of the books that got stolen. Two of the first editions that are up here.
Minna: Nice.
Rhi: Yes. Blaire?
Kim: I am going to roll a Survey for it.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: 4?
Rhi: 4, okay.
Kim: The 4s just love me tonight.
Rhi: Yeah. You find one of the books. It’s another one of the first editions. And you keep searching and I think that you’re, like, wandering sort of deeper and deeper into the storage space and eventually Crow is like:
Rhi (as Crow): Hey, come back, you’re— I can’t have you out of sight, come on.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. Sorry.
Rhi: So, you’ve got three of the books. And at this point, you’ve kinda looked through most of the space. And you don’t see the other three. And the other three are the ones that are specifically kind of related to Iruvia and Iruvian history.
Kim: Mm. So, she’s hiding them.
Minna: Or she gave them to someone else already.
Kim: Mm… that’s a possibility. That’s bad.
Rhi: How do you want to address that?
Kim: Gonna ghost field it. I’m gonna see if I can Arkham Asylum what happened here.
Rhi: Oh. Okay.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, sure. Yeah, controlled position.
Kim: That’s a 6, 3, 5.
Rhi: Okay, so a 6. Um, so I think this is still gonna be reduced effect because these are not arcane objects that are gonna leave a huge residue in the ghost field.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So, I think that with a 6 you are able to see kind of some flashback of this space. And you can see basically kind of a time lapse of starting from this space being mostly empty to the door opening and closing over and over again as, you know, people are bringing stuff in. And every so often you will see a woman come in and collect— you’re guessing that this is Nadra.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: That she comes in and collects a few items and takes them away back down the stairs to the rest of the house. And you do eventually, kind of where Myra found her books, you see that she comes over and collects a couple more books, and then where you found your one she collects one. You can tell on the, like, you’re able to get sort of a ghostly glimpse of the spine of one of them, and the lettering is in the alphabet that they use in Iruvia.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: They have a different alphabet. And so, she takes those three books and leaves with them. So, it seems like they have been moved somewhere else.
Kim: That stinks. Alright, so yeah, Blaire takes off her spirit mask and relays all that back to Myra.
Minna (as Myra): Alright. Well, let’s take what they’ve got and try and track down the rest. Did you see what direction she went?
Kim: I did see that, right?
Rhi: Uh, just that she went back downstairs.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: I think she turns to the guard.
Minna (as Myra): Is there any place else that she might keep more sensitive items? Because you haven’t filled our end of the deal, because we’ve only found half of what we’re looking for.
Rhi: Oh… he just kind of— he’s been a pretty stoic dude the whole time. Not hostile, just not really chatting. And he kinda gives you sort of a stone-faced look and is like:
Rhi (as Crow): This is where everything is. If you can’t find your stuff here, then she doesn’t have it.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, but she does.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re gonna have to do something to get him to explain where things are.
Minna: Yeah, can I roll, like, Consort on it?
Rhi: Yeah. This is gonna be reduced effect, cause you are running up against something that he is—
Minna: I’m gonna push myself for increased effect.
Rhi: Okay. Just be extra persuasive. And this, I think, actually is gonna be risky…
Minna: That’s a crit.
Rhi: Okay, Jesus.
Josie: Yay!
Minna: I roll four dice on Consort rolls.
Rhi: That’s fair.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: What do you say to try and persuade him here? Cause this is something that he is, under normal circumstances, would not be willing to give up this information. Not even for, you know, the money that you’ve paid.
Minna: I think Myra makes a new promise. She pulls out the lamp with lamp oil and tinder and flint that she has and she says:
Minna (as Myra): I can make this a much bigger mess for you if you want me to. But I think neither of us wants that.
Rhi: Oh. [laughs] Okay. So, I think he kind of looks at the lamp, and I think that it’s a situation where you’re, like…
Minna: She like, starts tilting the lamp like she’s gonna start pouring oil.
Rhi: Mm hmm. I think that you’re far away enough that he can’t just tackle you, and shooting you would get blood all over the artifacts.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: And risk a bullet in something very valuable. So he, like, glowers at you and just is like:
Rhi (as Crow): Fine. They are downstairs in her quarters, where I will take you so you can continue to steal pieces of our history.
Rhi: And he kinda slams the door open and gestures for you two to go ahead.
Minna (as Myra): Pieces of your history? Do you mean the books themselves were originally Iruvian?
Rhi (as Crow): They weren’t written here.
Minna (as Myra): Then what do you need them for? Rather, what is your interest?
Rhi (as Crow): Iruvia. That is my interest.
Minna (as Myra): Iruvia’s rather a wide concept.
Rhi (as Crow): So is an Empire.
Minna (as Myra): You don’t like The Empire.
Rhi: [laughs] Blank. Just completely blank faces you and just gestures for you to start going downstairs again.
Minna: I think she just tosses over her shoulder:
Minna (as Myra): You know, we’re not much of fans either.
Rhi: Yeah. So, he closes the door and locks it, and is like, uh, I don’t think he says much. He just, you know, will walk the two of your downstairs. And I think he stops outside the door and will point to the paper that I assume Myra has had with the titles on it.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: And is like:
Rhi (as Crow): Gimme that. I’ll get them. Don’t need you poking around in everything else.
Minna (as Myra): Alright.
Rhi: Uh, yeah, so he will go into the room, closes the door behind him. You did get a critical. [laughs] I was like, “Does he keep his word here?” But I think he does believe that you will burn the house down. So yeah, he’s gone for a couple minutes and then comes back with three books and your paper resting on top of them, and just kind of shoves them towards you.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi (as Crow): Don’t thank me for this.
Minna (as Myra): What’s your name, out of curiosity?
Rhi (as Crow): I don’t believe that I’ll be giving you that. I’ve given you more than I should have.
Minna (as Myra): You know, I’m actually sorry for it.
Rhi (as Crow): Well.
Rhi: And he kinda looks at the books.
Rhi (as Crow): Clearly not that sorry.
Minna: I, Minna, am having a fucking crisis.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: I don’t wanna take them!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I will tell you—
Kim: “It belongs in a museum.”
Rhi: I mean, more or less, yeah.
Minna: It belongs with the people it came from, not in an Akorosian museum!
Kim: I know, I know, Indiana Jones has aged poorly. I recognize this.
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Minna: I think she’s gonna glance sideways at Blaire, like, “How are you feeling about this?” in her eyes.
Kim: Um, I think Blaire’s just gonna look at you like that, “I dunno,” kinda shrug.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t feel right taking this history from you.
Rhi: Okay, are you like, handing them back?
Minna: Yes. She’s, like, holding them out.
Minna (as Myra): And I don’t think that my client would feel right either.
Rhi: Kinda narrows his eyes at you suspiciously and then will take them back and, you know, kind of tucks them under his arm. Is like:
Rhi (as Crow): Thanks.
Minna (as Myra): Neither of our people started out Akorosian.
Rhi: He kinda shrugs a little and will nod and then kinda jerks his, you know, does that thing where he kinda points with his chin down the hallway and is like:
Rhi (as Crow): You should collect your friend and probably head out the way you came. Knock before you go in.
Rhi: And then he’s gonna go and unlock the door so he can put the books back. And yeah, you two can go and try to collect Minx.
Minna: [laughs] Yes, let’s go find Minx.
Josie: So, what is the scene they walk in on?
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: That is 100% up to you. I mean, they knock, they were warned to knock, so…
Josie: [laughs] I— I kind of imagine… I don’t think action has been going on in there, but I think you, like, hear laughter and stuff and when the door is opened they’re kind of sitting next to each other on the bed laughing at their conversation, and Minx has somehow acquired a cup of tea.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah.
Kim: Oh my God, of course.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi (as Guard): Oh, uh, oh! Uh…
Rhi: And she like, she’s put her sword down. She scrambles to her feet and grabs her sword and is like:
Rhi (as Guard): [clears throat] Uh, everything good? Done? Every— yep. Mm hmm.
Josie (as Minx): Looks like it.
Rhi (as Guard): Okay. I guess you should probably go back out the window.
Josie (as Minx): [sighs] Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve left a lady’s room this way.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Wow…
Rhi (as Guard): Uh yeah, well, this was a… much better break-in than the first one, I suppose.
Josie (as Minx): We endeavor to have some class.
Rhi: And she kinda like will glance at Blaire and Myra and kinda give them a nod, and then will lean in to Minx and be like:
Rhi (as Guard): Uh, yeah, I mean, if you wanna, you know, pick up this conversation another time… I’m kinda gonna be on this detail for a couple weeks, but after that if you just stop by the embassy and ask for Shawti, uh, you know, I’ll see if I’m free.
Josie (as Minx): Of course, dear.
Josie: Wink. [laughs]
Rhi: Yep. [laughs] She winks back and then yeah, the three of you can go on out the window. [laughs]
Josie: Yay!
Rhi: Collect your gear and go about your business.
Josie: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): So, you managed to find everything?
Minna (as Myra): We found everything. We only took three of the books with us, though. Kit will understand.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, historians.
Rhi: [laughs] So, I think you, you know, couple of days later, return to the Historical Society. I think Kit is outside supervising the installation of a new window. He’s not really being— I think he’s doing that thing where he’s asking a lot of questions and the construction workers are flatly ignoring him because he has no idea what he’s talking about. [laughs] Because he’s never built anything with a hammer in his life.
Minna: Why is Kit so relatable? I love him. I know I made him up, but I love him.
Rhi: [laughs] So, he sees the three of you coming and is like:
Rhi (as Kit): Oh, oh, hello! Um, come on in. We can talk about… uh… things. Inside.
Rhi: [laughs] And he will actually lead you, I think, into the back office he had gestured to earlier, which I think is like, his office. It’s a little further away from all the hammering. Also, not really anywhere to sit. But you know, it’s fine. So yeah, he leads you all back in there and is like:
Rhi (as Kit): Um, so, how did it go?
Minna (as Myra): So, I have good news and bad news.
Rhi (as Kit): Okay…
Minna (as Myra): I got the three, the three books relating to Akorosian history. Well, North Sea history. The Iruvian books, we did not bring back.
Rhi (as Kit): Okay.
Minna (as Myra): The people who stole them are Iruvians themselves and seem to view it as reclaiming stolen history. And it didn’t, honestly, seem right if— I mean, I can make some kind of reparation to you if… for the loss of the books. But it didn’t seem right to take them.
Rhi (as Kit): Yes… uh… hmm. Well, I am— I can’t argue with your logic there. I obviously did not want records of our history here to be stolen from me, so I can’t argue with that. It is disappointing to not have access to those, they were very useful tomes and unique perspectives, but uh—
Minna (as Myra): Who knows, maybe you could make a couple of friends in Imperial City.
Rhi (as Kit): [laughs] Oh, that would quite a trip. But perhaps. In any event, well, thank you for securing the three that you were able to get. And I think once they have departed, we can have those returned. Um… payment! Right!
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: And he like, leans over and there’s a safe kind of tucked under his desk. And he leans over and opens up and he’ll pull out the money for you and be like:
Rhi (as Kit): This isn’t much, but hopefully it will make up for any trouble you might have had in getting these back.
Minna (as Myra): Thank you.
Rhi (as Kit): And yes, as I said, the, you know, Historical Society is open to all three of you whenever you would like. I’d be more than happy to have you here.
Minna (as Myra): Glad to hear it.
Rhi: Picturing Blaire just, like, sling-shotting herself at the nearest bookshelf. [laughs]
Kim: Oh, she is so excited.
Rhi: [laughs] Blaire does not notice that they have been paid because her nose is already in a book.
Kim: Who wants the over under on how long it takes for her to get thrown out?
Rhi: Oh… [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Kit is a very patient man, but eventually…
Kim: Yup.

"Season 3, Episode 18: The Stolen Deed Score Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate all the reviews and commentary and Patreon support. It means a lot.
For today’s episode, I would like to offer a formal apology to the Ace Attorney series, a video game I have never played and yet was a powerful inspiration thanks to the shenanigans of my players… and a critical success on an acquire asset roll.
Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Kim: I want all of our listeners to know that everyone behind The Magpies Podcast believes in and supports the Black Lives Matter movement. Black lives have always mattered. They mattered yesterday, they matter today, they will matter tomorrow, and they will continue to matter every single day afterwards.
In honor of the nationwide uprisings happening in the US at the time of this recording, and also in honor of Pride Month, we are featuring the National Black Justice Coalition as this month’s charity. The NBJC is a civil rights organization that works to empower Black LGBTQA+ people. They work to increase education on HIV and AIDS in the African American community, encourage historically Black colleges to create a safe environment for their gay and trans students, support non-traditional queer families, and so much more.
To learn more about what they do and to donate, please visit NBJC.org. To all of our Black listeners, we see you, we love you, and we stand beside you. We are with you in this fight. Black lives matter.
Rhi: I can’t say I feel exactly like a broken record, because I feel like every time I record an intro I’m talking about some new horror we’re facing as a society, although these latest protests aren’t about anything new. Racism and anti-blackness are as old as America. But as horrific as the police response has been to these protests, as heartbreaking as it is to hear so many names and see so many faces of people whose murders drove protesters into the street… change is happening.
It’s been about two weeks, and cities are reducing spending on police. The Minneapolis City Council is having an actual serious discussion about disbanding their police department. Is it enough? No, but it’s only been two weeks. If we can keep this up, what might change in a month, in three months?
That said, we are still in a pandemic. We are still in a crushing economic depression. We in America, and elsewhere, are still in an authoritarian state that has proven again and again it will not hesitate to deploy violence to maintain power. So, be careful, be safe, take care of yourselves and each other.
This fight is a marathon, and you have to take breaks. 2020 has brought unimaginable crises, but it has also shown a strength of community and a depth of love for each other that gives me hope. Things are bad, and scary, but so many of us are doing what we can to protect and care for and fight for each other. A better world isn’t guaranteed, but I think there’s still a chance for one.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:03:43]
Rhi: So, we see The magpies making their way through Nightmarket. It’s getting on towards evening, probably about 5 or 6 o’clock, and I think they are coming back from spending the afternoon over at the Red Lamp helping with paperwork and wards and backrubs as all was arranged previously.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And they are making their way to The Hound’s Paw, and at this time of the evening this is kind of when the first rush hits. People are getting off work and want to have a drink, so The Hound’s Paw typically is all lit up, people are heading in through the door, this tends to be the busiest time for them. But as you approach, you see that most of the lights are off, door is closed, the closed sign is flipped over in the window, and on the door there’s like… it looks like a piece of paper was hammered up there, because you can see the little tacks and then some corners of paper where something was ripped down.
Josie: Huh. Does the door have a window on it? Or is there a window we can peek in?
Rhi: Yeah, there’s windows that you can peer in.
Kim: Blaire knocks.
Rhi: Heh. Yeah, so Minx peering in the window, you can see that it doesn’t look like the bar, like, it doesn’t look like it ever opened. The chairs are all still put up, and I think you can just barely make out Rigney standing behind the bar with his head in his hands.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: And then when Blaire knocks he kinda startles and looks up and will walk over to the door, and when he sees it’s the three of you he opens it up.
Rhi (as Rigney): [heavy] Hey. Come on in. I suppose it’s best that you’re the first ones to know.
Kim (as Blaire): Know about what?
Rhi (as Rigney): [long sigh]
Rhi: He’ll let you in, close the door, and then say:
Rhi (as Rigney): Apparently I’m closing.
Kim & Josie (as Blaire & Minx): What?!
Rhi: He walks over to the bar and picks up a piece of paper and will hold it out for the three of you to look at. It is basically an eviction notice.
Minna: Myra’s flipping through looking for reasons.
Josie (as Minx): Why? The bar has been doing fine.
Rhi (as Rigney): Uh, yeah, I asked the same thing of my landlord when I went over to his office to demand an explanation for this bullshit.
Rhi: There isn’t really an explanation on there, Myra.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: It just says, you know—and it’s like, he has to be out in like three days.
Rhi (as Rigney): Apparently an offer was made for the building that was too good for him to refuse.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah…
Kim (as Blaire): Who outbid you?
Rhi (as Rigney): Well, I mean, I never owned the place, but um… [sighs] one Lord Mora, apparently.
Minna (as Myra): [scoffs]
Josie (as Minx): Ah, well that’s fortunate then, because now we can just ram a sword through his chest early and then be done with it.
Minna (as Myra): Minx, we may want to be a little more cautious than that.
Josie (as Minx): That’s true.
Kim (as Blaire): We just killed Madam Tesslyn not too long ago. We need to be a little bit more sparing about our blood trail.
Rhi: [laughing] Rigney moves to put his hands over his ears like “I shouldn’t be hearing this!”
Josie (as Minx): Right, but if the Circle is dead then there will be no one to follow the trail, eh?
Rhi (as Rigney): I mean, I think the Bluecoats would probably still investigate somewhat.
Josie (as Minx): Eh… fine. Let’s buy another building, everyone.
Rhi: So, we see sort of the wavy flashback lines, and then we see Minx at a party. It’s a nice fancy high-society rich people party. Minx is here for, I would assume, either enjoying the high life, looking for marks, probably both.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: At one point in the course of the evening, Minx, you end up at the bar at the same time as an Akorosian man, looks like he’s probably in his early to mid-30s, light skin, brown hair. What catches your attention about him is that he is impeccably dressed. His fashion is flawless. The season’s latest styles in the latest colors and patterns. This is someone who has that rare combination of both money and taste.
Josie (as Minx): I must say, your cravat is impeccable.
Rhi (as fancy man): Oh, thank you. Not many appreciate the finer points of accessorizing, although I can see you certainly are one who does. What is your name?
Josie: Uh… Lady Redwall. Let’s do it. Let’s throw some Redwall appreciation in there.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: Yay, Redwall!
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Lady Redwall. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Rhi (as fancy man): Ah, a pleasure to meet you. I’m Nicholas Firebird.
Rhi: He says it with kind of that look where he expects you to recognize the name.
Josie: Minx doesn’t off-hand, but her face brightens up anyway.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Because she’s like “shit, that’s a cool name.” [laughs] “I gotta use that.”
Rhi: Yeah. I think as you talk with Nicholas here it eventually comes out through conversation that he is a real estate solicitor. Specifically, it seems like he has—because I think you end up gossiping basically, and anybody who’s purchased property in the last ten years or so in Brightstone has probably gone through him, so he has all kinds of fun and exciting gossip about what people have in their homes, nasty stuff in their finances that had to get covered up, and yeah. I think you have a nice time chatting with this guy, and then didn’t really think anything of it until this moment where you are once again confronted with a real estate problem.
Josie: Yes. [chuckles]
Rhi: And wavy flashback lines return us.
Josie: I think Minx did just straight up zone out for a couple moments.
Rhi: [laughing] Uh-huh!
Josie: And then is suddenly like:
Josie (as Minx): Ah-ha! I believe I know someone who can help.
Kim (as Blaire): You do?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Has anyone heard of Nicholas Firebird?
Kim (as Blaire): Nuh-uh.
Josie (as Minx): Big time real estate agent in Brightstone. I think we might be able to use him to sneak this back out from under Lord Mora.
Kim (as Blaire): When did you meet a real estate attorney?
Josie (as Minx): At a party some time back. I didn’t think much of it at the time aside from his cravat.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Of course, that’s what did it.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm, that and the distinctive name.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s a pretty cool name.
Josie (as Minx): It’s a shame it’s taken by such a prominent person. I was inclined to use that last name as part of an identity. I do believe he has offices somewhere. Shall we go speak with him?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t see why not.
Josie (as Minx): Excellent. No worries, Rigney. The bar will be open for business inside of three days, hopefully.
Kim (as Blaire): Are you all right with that, Rigs?
Rhi (as Rigney): I mean, if I don’t have to shut down my livelihood and move out of my home with no plans to reestablish either, yeah, that would be great. I would very much appreciate that.
Kim: [sad groan]
Rhi: Yeah, he looks pretty stressed. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Can I give him a hug, or do you think he would like, not in a hug mood right now?
Rhi: No, he’d go for a hug.
Kim: Okay. Blaire’s just gonna hug him without even saying anything.
Rhi: Yeah, he hugs you back.
Josie: Blaire gives good hugs.
Kim: She does, and Rigney receives them well.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Listen, as a player I just love hugging Rigney.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: Yeah, he needs hugs, so it works out.
Kim: I know! Blaire is here to provide.
Rhi: So yeah, I think he will hug you back and pat your shoulders.
Rhi (as Rigney): I mean, probably gonna start packing up some of my stuff just in case, but hopefully in a few days you all can help me unpack it, here.
Josie (as Minx): Have we ever failed you before?
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Have we?
Rhi: No, no, but I think he kind of looks a little awkward and vaguely guilty.
Minna: Oh no!
Rhi: You may not have failed him, but he kinda screwed you all over that one time.
Kim: We forgive him!
Rhi: [chuckles]
Kim: We forgave him for that, though. It’s fine.
Rhi: I know, but he still feels guilty.
Rhi (as Rigney): All right, well, if you’re gonna get started on this, better get moving, because that got posted this morning so I basically gotta be out day after tomorrow.
Josie (as Minx): Then let’s hop to it.
Rhi: All right! So, we cut across the city to Brightstone to the very refined law office of Nicholas Firebird, Esquire. I think he has an assistant who will very suspiciously ask for your names.
Josie (as Minx): Lady Elizabeth Redwall. We met the acquaintance of Mr. Firebird at a party and require his assistance in a transaction, or contesting one rather.
Rhi: She narrows her eyes at the three of you.
Rhi (as assistant): I’ll be right back. Please wait here.
Rhi: And heads into the back office. I think after a few minutes she comes back looking a little displeased and is followed by Nicholas Firebird who kinda—clearly Blaire and Myra don’t register to him at all, like he clearly doesn’t recognize the two of you—but he kinda squints at Minx for a couple seconds and is like:
Rhi (as Nicholas): Oh, the Evermars’ party, right? You liked my cravat!
Josie (as Minx): Yes! Precisely. It’s good to see you again.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Yes, good to see you.
Josie (as Minx): And I see your taste hasn’t wavered at all.
Rhi (as Nicholas): [chuckles] I would hope not. This is a bit unconventional. Usually I set up appointments for this sort of thing, but if you can tell me briefly about what you need I might be able to…
Josie (as Minx): Unfortunately, the problem came to light this morning, so it unfortunately didn’t have the prep time that I think both of us would prefer. An associate of ours who sits in opposition to a member of high society is having a very important place essentially bought out from under them on very short notice, and it seems very clear that it’s not on the up and up, so we were hoping you could help us get to the bottom of that.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Hmm, well it’s gonna honestly depend on who the member of high society is, because I have a certain reputation to maintain. Do you know who is trying to make this purchase?
Josie (as Minx): Right, right, it’s no big deal, really. It’s just Lord Mora.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Lord Alistair Mora?
Josie (as Minx): Uh-huh.
Rhi (as Nicholas): … I’m in.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Wow. All right.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah?
Rhi: [laughing] He just walks back, and his assistant just groans and rolls her eyes really theatrically, and he’s just like:
Rhi (as Nicholas): I don’t wanna hear it. Please, come in. Tell me everything.
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): What’s your history with Lord Mora?
Rhi (as Nicholas): Lord Mora? None. His lawyer, however…
Rhi: [laughs] He sits down very huffily at his desk.
Rhi (as Nicholas): His lawyer, Milo Virtos, has been a longstanding rival of mine.
Rhi: Then I think as the door is closing you just hear the assistant go:
Rhi (as assistant): That’s not all he was!
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: Uh…
Josie: [smiling] Minx is suddenly beaming and has her hands to her cheeks.
Josie (as Minx): I do believe we walked in on something amazing.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, I don’t think we should pry any further about…
Josie (as Minx): Oh, no need.
Kim (as Blaire): [grumbles]
Josie (as Minx): Continue.
Rhi: [laughing] Minx is like, I have all the details that I need about this situation, and I’m thrilled.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): [quietly] We don’t want to make him uncomfortable. We barely know this guy.
Rhi: I think as Blaire is muttering that he just leans back in his chair and is like:
Rhi (as Nicholas): It was a very messy breakup, and now any opportunity I have to screw him over I will gladly take. So, tell me everything about this deal.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Well, Lord Mora is attempting to buy out The Hound’s Paw tavern in Nightmarket. It’s kind of a community establishment and one we frequent and patronize and have friends there, ahem, as it were. It would mean a lot to us if that could remain open for business and decidedly out of Lord Mora’s hands, because we are not fans of him.
Rhi: He nods, and I think he will ask a few questions of you and then at some point gets up and opens the door and tells his assistant to run down to the Hall of Records before they close and pull these files, and she’s just like:
Rhi (as assistant): I’m charging you overtime!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi (as Nicholas): Fine! Fine! That’s fine, just get me the papers. We only have two days!
Rhi: I think after, he gets a little information from you and he says that he will continue to get some info on his end, so I think we gloss over that and then he says:
Rhi (as Nicholas): All right. What is your ideal end game here? Do you just want the sale to not go through? Would you prefer that your friend own the place at the end of this?
Josie (as Minx): Preferably Rigney would own the place, because the person who owns it now seems more than willing to get rid of it.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Yes. I think I can arrange that with the right paperwork and signatures on the correct forms. Don’t worry about the money. The money’s already changed hands, I just need to make it look like it came from different places.
[giggling]
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi: He just shrugs a little.
Rhi (as Nicholas): You don’t get to be the top real estate attorney in a city like Duskwall if you play by the rules.
Josie (as Minx): I think we will get along well in that regard.
Rhi (as Nicholas): The only thing that I can’t really come up with on my own is the deed to the building. That’s a very official document, and if we want this to be ironclad we’re going to need that.
Josie (as Minx): Although, won’t it be questioned how you came to be in possession of that document?
Rhi (as Nicholas): No, that’ll go into my whole—part of the argument I’m going to be making here is that the current landlord didn’t actually have standing to sell it because he didn’t actually have the deed, because you’re gonna take it. It’s sort of complex, but basically by him not having the deed it’ll help our case.
Josie (as Minx): I see.
Rhi (as Nicholas): And potentially slow things down. If nothing else it’ll buy us a little bit of time if Milo has to scramble around to find that.
Rhi: He kind of rubs his hands together. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Excellent.
Kim (as Blaire): So, I hate to be the one to bring this up, but… you’re doing this for us pro bono?
Rhi (as Nicholas): Hmm… You know, I got so wrapped up in the idea of sticking it to Milo that I sort of forgot about payment.
Rhi: The assistant outside, you just hear a thunk as her head hits the desk.
[laughter]
Rhi (as Nicholas): I am afraid I would need to charge you. Normally for something like this I would charge 4 coin a week, but this being a rush job I would actually normally charge more for that. I think typically we’d be looking at 6 coin for something like this. However, you are granting me an opportunity that I very rarely get. Milo deliberately avoids cases where I am involved, because he’s a coward who won’t face me… Anyway.
Josie: Minx giggles.
[laughter]
Rhi (as Nicholas): I will… Let’s say 3 coin for this.
Josie (as Minx): I see. I think we can manage that.
Rhi: He will also tell you:
Rhi (as Nicholas): Also, you do not pay me until the job is done, so you do not have to pay anything upfront. Once I have settled all of this for you and your friend, then you will pay me. Also, I think it might be easiest, because I’m going to need some information from your friend Mr. Rigney as well… I may just, I’ll check with him but save you a trip as well, may just set up in his bar and operate out of there for the next couple days. I haven’t been down to Nightmarket in a while.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, well we would be glad to see you there.
Rhi (as Nicholas): All right. Well, yes, I think if you can get me the deed to the property I can handle the rest.
Josie (as Minx): Then it’s a deal.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Wonderful. This is gonna be fun.
[laughter]
Josie: As they leave, Minx is like:
Josie (as Minx): [delighted] We’re helping out with a spurned lover revenge scene.
[laughter]
Minna (as Myra): It does rather fit our mandate, doesn’t it?
Josie (as Minx): It definitely fits mine.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: Do y’all wanna start working on gathering some info about how to obtain the deed to a property?
Kim: Yes.
Josie: Yes. Who owns said property?
Rhi: This you would be able to get from Rigney. The owner is named Lucas Sharrin.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Landlord. He owns a few properties in Nightmarket and rents them out to businesses, apartments, that sort of thing. Pretty typical setup from what Rigney has said.
Josie: How would we go about tracking down his other properties?
Rhi: There’s records that you could look up in Charterhall.
Josie: I’m thinking we figure out another property of his, stage some sort of problem at said property to get him to go there, and then while he is out we slip in and retrieve the deed.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Provided that it’s in his home, which it may not be.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Research isn’t really my thing.
Kim: I want to roll a Study to get a feel for how Milo operates just in the off chance that he interferes early, what to expect from him.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. I think also, Josie had the idea of somebody checking the records in Charterhall but it sounded like not wanting Minx to do that herself.
Josie: Yes.
Minna: I mean, Myra’s definitely done that in the past, so I can take that if you want.
Rhi: Yeah, and then maybe Minx can scout out his place?
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Let’s actually start with Myra hitting up the records hall.
Minna: That is a critical.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: What?
Josie: Nice.
Minna: I rolled four dice and got two 6s.
Rhi: On a Study roll?
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Nice. Okay, so you are able to find information about all the properties that he owns I think including the recently filed I guess contract bill of sale for The Hound’s Paw, and that includes some information about what’s gonna happen to the place. Lord Mora is planning on tearing it down and building a building of multiple shops and apartments and things on the site.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, you know that that’s kind of what’s happening with The Hound’s Paw. You also find that he owns a building that has a stationary store, sells papers and ink and pens, and has a couple apartments above it, and then a high end cobbler shoe shop that also has an apartment above it. It seems to be kind of the kind of building. The Hound’s Paw has an apartment over it where Rigney lives, so it seems to be that’s sort of his setup where he will rent a building to somebody where they can live and work in the same space.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: So, you got a critical. Is there any other information that you would like on that, Myra?
Minna: Yeah. I mostly wanted to know, like, are we looking at his house or at an office for trying to find these, this stuff?
Rhi: Oh yeah, probably it seems like the landlording is his primary source of income now, so you’re guessing probably at his house.
Minna: Okay, that makes sense.
Rhi: There doesn’t seem to be anything… yeah. It doesn’t seem like he has a business address listed on any of these. So, let’s then go to Minx who is scoping out Mr. Sharrin’s house.
Josie: Yes. I actually kinda wanna scope out several properties if I can.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. What do you wanna—Oh, do you wanna look at his house and then the places he owns?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it. All of them are in Nightmarket, so you can just kinda stroll around.
Josie: Cool. I’m gonna roll Survey. I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay! Good score for you all so far.
Kim: Don’t jinx it.
Rhi: So yeah, he’s got a nice townhome in Nightmarket, and then the other two businesses that he rents out look pretty similar to The Hound’s Paw just in terms of the clientele that they’re aimed at. The Hound’s Paw is kind of a middle to upper middle class sports bar, which makes the fact that you all picked it as your hangout spot wild in retrospect.
[laughter]
Kim: Yeah, we don’t do a sport.
Rhi: A little bit, just a smidge. Yeah, so the other two are kind of aimed at a similar clientele. They both seem to be pretty successful businesses. You go and hang out outside of both of them for a little bit, and there’s a good number of people coming in and out. The businesses are both operating well, which means, in this context, that they are both steady sources of income.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Which is probably why he felt like he could get away with selling off one of his buildings, especially if he’s getting a—well Myra would have been able to see that Lord Mora paid handsomely for this property, like a lot of money, more than it’s probably worth.
Minna: Yeah. This is also spite-motivated I’m assuming.
Rhi: A little bit. There’s a little bit of spite, yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: You all did recently kill one of his compatriots, so there’s maybe a little bit of vengeance happening here. Yeah, is there anything in particular that you would like to learn about any of these buildings, Minx?
Josie: Honestly, given kind of how mundane they are, I think we can probably just go in through the house and not worry about it.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I think Minx had the idea and checked it out, and it didn’t pan out this time.
Rhi: Yeah. Did you wanna get anything in particular about his house?
Josie: Yeah, general layout and if there’s any security measures that I can see.
Rhi: Yeah. It looks like it’s a pretty typical Nightmarket brick townhome. Sort of a narrower building, three stories tall. From what you can see of the security, you can kinda see that there’s definitely some spark-craft security on the place. It doesn’t appear to have any security guards on staff. He doesn’t have that kind of money.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: But it looks like he’s got a pretty solid spark-craft security system that would set off alarms and alert any nearby patrolling Bluecoats that something is amiss.
Josie: Gotcha. Okay, so it might be a fairly simple breaking and entering. I feel like our current plan would be to break in and take a bunch of other stuff.
Minna: Oh yeah, so he doesn’t realize that…
Kim: Ah.
Josie: Yeah, and not that we specifically targeted the deed.
Kim: I mean, that way we can also profit for once.
[laughter]
Rhi: Oh my God!
Josie: Yeah. We’re actually gonna ransack a place. What the hell?
Rhi: Okay, and then Blaire, you wanted to follow up on Milo and see what his deal is?
Kim: Yes. Yeah, I actually already rolled earlier. I got a 3, 4, 5.
Rhi: Okay, so a 5. I think that if you ask… I’m picturing the next morning, like you all kind of check in at The Hound’s Paw and Nicholas has already set up at one of the tables. Rigney is a little bemused by this situation. [laughs] He was not actually expecting this to happen. I think when you all get there the two of them are talking and Rigney is answering a bunch of questions about the building and about his landlord and things like that. He will wrap up his conversation with Rigney and then will start chatting with you about what Milo’s operating style is like as a lawyer.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I think the 5 here is reflective of the fact that you kind of have to take a lot of what he says with a grain of salt.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Because he is more than happy to exaggerate any flaws. He does say that Milo is very organized. He will begrudgingly admit that Milo is good at his job, and he’s been on retainer for Lord Mora for a while now, and he I think in particular wants to make sure that this deal goes smoothly. This was kind of unbeknownst to all of you, and Nick still has not made the connection of who you all actually are, but the Ink Row deal was a thing that Milo would have worked on.
Minna: Mmm…
Kim: Oh.
Josie: Ah.
Rhi: So he lost out on that, because that all fell apart because of all of you.
[chuckling]
Kim: Huh.
Rhi: So, I think that… Nicholas suspects that he’s gonna be very determined to make sure that this goes smoothly.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Nicholas is like:
Rhi (as Nicholas): And I am equally determined to make sure that it blows up in the street.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: I’m just trying to keep on the lookout for any updated autopsy reports that are coming our way.
[laughter]
Rhi: So, you’ve got a target. I’m guessing this is gonna be Stealth?
Josie: Yes.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Engagement roll… All right, that is a 5.
Kim: [groan/sigh of relief]
Josie: Phew.
Rhi: Starting—Yeah, the other one was a 2. So, you are gonna be starting in a risky position.
## Score [0:31:13]
Rhi: You kinda spend that day after you meet Nicholas doing your research. I think you talk to him and Rigney about the plan, leave the two of them chatting at The Hound’s Paw, and you gear up, make your way out into Nightmarket again, head over to another townhome. It feels kinda similar to the other score that you did recently.
Minna: [giggles] I was getting deja vu.
Rhi: But as you’re making your way over, all three of you start to get the feeling that you’re being followed.
Josie: Hmm.
Kim: How so?
Rhi: It’s hard to pin down. It’s a little bit of that, like, just that you see things out of the corner in your eye, like movement that when you turn there’s nothing there, that hair on the back of your neck standing up feeling like somebody’s watching you.
Kim: [creeped out noises]
Rhi: Nothing solid that you can pin down, it’s just a feeling, but nothing happens as you make your way.
Kim: Can I look into the ghost field?
Rhi: Yeah. I think that you get to the townhome, and Blaire, you kind of decide to check around before heading in. So yeah, go ahead and do that. It’s gonna be risky.
Kim: Six, five, one.
Rhi: Six… Okay. Sorry, I gotta read about something here.
Kim: That’s okay.
Rhi: You kinda stop near the back of the house. Minx and Myra are probably looking up at the windows and quietly discussing the best way in. Blaire, you look back and into the ghost field and kind of scan the area behind you.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It looks pretty typical. There’s a lot of the fainter outlines of living people. There’s a handful of ghosts drifting around. There’s little dots here and there of various little occult charms that people have tucked away. Then, you kinda let your gaze drift up a little bit, and it looks like on the roof of a building, a couple buildings back, so your regular sight you wouldn’t be able to see it…
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: …but in the ghost field you can, there is a humanoid figure that is just blindingly bright in the ghost field.
Kim: Oh… and I’ve seen this before, haven’t I?
Rhi: You have seen it before. It’s been quite a while. Way, way back in Season 1 when you all attacked that ship that was stopped out in the harbor, that’s where you got the Eye of Kotar, something was attacking the crew and the Umbra Hunters who came on to stop you, and as you were leaving you saw a figure standing on the deck that looked a lot like that. Very, very bright.
Josie: Wow, that’s a hell of a callback.
Kim: Yeah, I don’t know how I remembered that, but I just knew that… having the out of character information that I have, knowing that Blaire has seen this before.
Rhi: Yeah, but I don’t think Blaire knows what it is necessarily. I don’t know if she…
Kim: Yeah, I don’t think she knows what it is either, but do you think she would make the connection like oh, I’ve seen this before a long time ago?
Rhi: I think so. Yeah, I think she would remember that she’s seen it before, but she doesn’t know what it is. She didn’t know what it was then, she doesn’t know what it is now.
Kim: Okay. Blaire’s gonna take her mask off and just say:
Kim (as Blaire): We’re being tailed.
Josie (as Minx): By whom?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know, but something on the roof’s following us.
Josie (as Minx): Something? I can’t help but notice the terminology there.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know if it’s a person.
Josie (as Minx): [heavy exhale]
Kim (as Blaire): It’s not a ghost either. It’s something in between, or something more. I can’t really tell.
Josie (as Minx): Could it be Ojal?
Kim (as Blaire): No… No.
Kim: Out of character, does Ojal have a signature? She must, right?
Rhi: I don’t think that you had a chance to look at her in the ghost field.
Kim: Hmm, that would track.
Josie: Although we did encounter hulls before.
Rhi: Yes. I think that, yeah, because hulls are around in the city, so Blaire I think that you would know that hulls look like just a brightly glowing point just kinda floating in space. Like, the hull body doesn’t show up in the ghost field at all because it’s just made of metal, but there’s—Actually, I take that back. What you see is there’s this glowing central point and then there’s the lines that carry the electroplasm out, so it looks like a network of veins almost running out through whatever form.
Kim: Oh, oh-oh-oh, I see. It’s very webby?
Rhi: Kinda, yeah.
Josie: It’s like you’re seeing the circuitry.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yes, exactly. It looks very different than this. This is just a humanoid figure that is solidly glowing very brightly, so you’re pretty sure not a hull.
Kim: Yeah, all right. So yeah, Blaire’s gonna relay all that back to the group and just be like:
Kim (as Blaire): Hulls are different from this.
Josie (as Minx): I don’t think we can press on knowing that’s there.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know how we’ll get to it, though. We’ll probably spook it off.
Josie (as Minx): Well, if it spooks away then that is good for us.
Kim (as Blaire): Do you think we should get rid of it before we get closer to the house?
Josie (as Minx): Yes.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, I’m not really comfortable with that following us.
Josie (as Minx): Where precisely is it?
Kim (as Blaire): The rooftops, behind us, a couple leagues back. Does anyone have any ideas?
Minna: If we look, can we see it also.
Rhi: If you two look into the ghost field, yeah. You don’t have to roll Attune now that Blaire has kinda told you what to look for. Yeah, you can both see it.
Minna (as Myra): Interesting.
Josie (as Minx): I say we just ascend to a rooftop and get its attention.
Kim (as Blaire): As quietly as we can. The more time we can buy getting closer to it the more time I can study it.
Josie (as Minx): Yes. Okay. I say we move a little bit towards the house, duck into a side alley, and then climb up to the roof as best we can.
Kim (as Blaire): Sounds like a plan.
Rhi: All right. So, the plan is to climb up to the roof, try and deal with this…?
Kim: Yep.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Okay. So yeah, I think I’m gonna need a roll for climbing up to a roof.
Josie: Group Prowl perhaps?
Rhi: Yeah, that would make sense. Does somebody wanna mark climbing gear?
Kim: Yes, I can.
Josie: Who wants to lead it?
Minna: I can lead.
Josie: Okay. Well, I got 3s, so… [chuckles]
Kim: I got a 5.
Minna: I got a 5, so I’m only marking 1 stress.
Josie: Woo.
Rhi: Yeah, 1 point of stress and the result is a 5, so you do it but there’s a consequence. I think that… Are you getting onto the roof of the house that you’re robbing or like next door?
Kim: I would say next door.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. You climb up onto the roof, you’re going slow and quiet, you make it up, and I think that you all get up there and you check the ghost field to see where this thing is… and it’s not where you left it.
Josie: Where is it?
Rhi: Well, you all kind of have a moment of panic and look around very frantically, and then you see the light of it coming down from what looks like a pretty impressive jump, and it lands on the opposite end of the roof from all of you.
Josie: Oh no!
Rhi: It’s on the same roof as you.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna kind of recoil in fright and stammer out:
Josie (as Minx): Hello?
Rhi: So, if you are looking with your normal sight, not ghost vision, it’s hard to make out a lot of distinguishing features. The person is wearing a fairly nice form-fitting coat that goes down to mid-calf, they have a hood up that is shielding a lot of their face, and a voice that you do not recognize says:
Rhi (as ???): I hadn’t expected the opportunity for payback so soon, but I suppose when it falls into my lap…
Josie: Oh dear.
Kim (as Blaire): Who are you?!
Josie (as Minx): Yes, that doesn’t exactly narrow it down.
Rhi: They’d sort of landed in a crouch and they slowly straighten up and start slowly moving towards you.
Rhi (as ???): Well, I suppose you wouldn’t recognize me anymore after what you did to my body.
Josie (as Minx): Oh dear.
Minna (as Myra): What was your name?
Rhi: I think that they are close enough now. Again, you can see the face, a random Akorosian person, like they have light skin, that’s kind of all you can tell, but they give you this horrible toothy slasher smile and just say…
Rhi (as ???): Tesslyn.
Rhi: …and she’s gonna lunge at Minx.
Josie: Oh no. Agh!
Kim: Ahh!
Josie (as Minx): [yelps]
Rhi: [laughs] I’m gonna need… She’s trying to tackle you off the roof, so I will need you to roll resistance to keep from being hurled three stories to the alley below.
Josie: Okay! That’s a Prowess resist.
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Oh… So this Devil’s Bargain is submitted by Patreon backer KrysmPhoenix, thank you Krysm, and the Bargain is: The death bell tolls but not for you. Spirit Wardens are in the area already for a simple pickup.
Josie: Huh…
Rhi: So, you’ve got a vampire and there would be Spirit Wardens nearby who might take notice of this situation.
Josie: But at the same time they might help with the vampire.
Rhi: They might.
Kim: They might… Two things though.
Josie: Yeah, you know what… Uh-huh?
Kim: Here’s my hang-up about reporting them to the Bluecoats which is… Sorry, no, not the Bluecoats, my hang-ups on reporting them to the Spirit Wardens. One, would the Spirit Wardens recognize Blaire, and two…
Rhi: [chuckles]
Kim: I had a second point. I’m trying to remember it.
Josie: I mean, the fact that Blaire carries ghosts on her at any given time is a pretty good counter-argument. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, it’s up to you, Josie.
Kim: Oh! Yeah, no, sorry. The second thing is that it’s all going to depend on how fast we put two and two together in character.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: You all know that this is some kind of spooky occult shit. You may not exactly have the word vampire, but you know it’s spooky occult shit.
Josie: I imagine there’s kind of a cultural perception of vampires, right? But it’s probably just like Bram Stoker kind of stuff? We don’t “know” that this is how vampires happen, unless you’re Blaire?
Rhi: No, I think that it is known that vampires happen when a spirit possesses a dead body.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: They can feed on a lot of things. They need to feed on mortals, but it’s not necessarily blood. I think that is a thing that is kind of a little bit of the stereotype, but there are stories of other vampires that can feed on emotions or things like that.
Josie: Right, so once we put it together that it’s a vampire we’ll understand what that is.
Rhi: Yeah. There also just like superhumanly powerful.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Yeah, so with all of that, do you want this Bargain?
Josie: See, for Blaire and Kim’s sake I don’t think I can…
Kim: [exhales]
Josie: You don’t sound excited.
Kim: Well no, I am excited, I’m just thinking. I mean, we could split up, even though that goes against the crew’s ethos at this point.
Josie: No. You know what? Let’s have an epic rooftop duel. I’m not gonna take that Devil’s Bargain.
Minna: Oh my God. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: All right, then go ahead and make your resistance roll. It will be Prowess to keep from being hurled off the roof.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Five, okay, so you’re gonna take 1 point of stress.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: You still… I think that would have been level 3 harm.
Josie: Uh-huh. [chuckles nervously]
Rhi: She’s still, like, I think you have to brace yourself pretty hard, and you still skid backwards a bit, and she hits you hard, like you are pretty banged up from her just linebackering into you, and that’s happening.
Josie (as Minx): Oof. Whoever you’re possessing is quite spry.
Rhi: Yeah, I don’t… She doesn’t seem to be interested in chatting at this point anymore. She looks like she’s… [laughs]
Josie: [laughing] Minx is.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean, it’s Minx. Yeah, what do people wanna do?
Kim: I know Blaire has to be more careful about this now, but I kind of want to unleash a ghost on her.
Rhi: Ooh, interesting.
Kim: Out of character, how would a vampire deal with that? Are they like equipped?
Rhi: I dunno. I have no idea.
Kim: Because they can’t really be re-possessed.
Rhi: I think it’s gonna be… It depends on what you wanna do with the ghost. Do you want to ask it nicely to do something? Do you want to just unleash it and see what happens?
Kim: I can kind of see this being a Command roll, but I’m also interested in just unleashing it and letting it do its thing.
Rhi: Yeah, so I think just unleashing it is gonna be Attune, or you could try and do a Command.
Kim: Okay. No, no, I have more in Attune.
Rhi: All right. This is gonna be risky, reduced effect.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay! So you whip out one of your ghost jars, open it up, a ghost comes screaming out, and it doesn’t seem to have any interest in Tesslyn.
Kim: At all?
Rhi: Because that’s a dead body. Dead bodies aren’t really of any interest to a ghost, and ghosts can’t eat each other.
Kim: Yeah…
Rhi: [laughing] Or the ghost problem would have cleared up years ago.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: So, it’s gonna turn on you and Myra.
Minna: [surprised and displeased noise]
Kim: That’s fine. I can deal with that.
Rhi: So, yeah, I think the complication here is that you’ve added a hungry ghost to the mix. [laughs]
Kim: It’s fine. I can just talk to it and let it go away, or coerce it back into the jar, whatever. Whichever actually works.
Minna: How is Minx doing with this situation?
Josie: She’s still not quite sure what to make of it.
Rhi: Minx is holding her own.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: She’s not been thrown off the roof, but it’s clearly a struggle.
Minna: [laughing] This is silly, but are there any folk superstitions about what you can do to a vampire?
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh, like silver or holy symbols or the like?
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Garlic.
Rhi: Garlic.
Minna: I just like the idea of her trying that, but I don’t know what it would be that she would have on-hand.
Rhi: Let me see here. You could try a spirit bane charm. [reading] Vampires are extremely rare… In legend, vampires were destroyed by the rays of the sun. Since the sun was shattered by the Cataclysm this is no longer possible.
Minna: Could I make a deduction that fire might work?
Rhi: Yeah!
Minna: [laughing] I’m gonna try fire, and if that doesn’t work at least I’ll set her on fire.
Rhi: Yeah. The book doesn’t have anything about specific myths, so if you would like to make up some kind of folklore about vampires you can do that, or you can just try and set her on fire.
Kim: Oh, hell, yes.
Josie: [laughs] Counting stuff.
Minna: [laughs uproariously]
Kim: Count–? OH! [claps]
Minna: Yes! Yes please.
Kim: Yes.
Minna: I want to try this dumb, dumb plan on her.
Josie: That’s why Vlad dad is so particular.
Minna: That’s my favorite vampire superstition. I can’t believe I didn’t think of it.
Kim: [laughs]
Minna: What do I have that I could just scatter everywhere? Oh boy.
Kim: Pebbles?
Minna: I feel like burglary gear might have, like, you know, the classic ball bearings you scatter everywhere. [laughs] I don’t know if that’s true. We’re not really into dungeoneering.
Rhi: I’ll allow it. I’ll allow it. Yeah, so if you mark that you have burglary gear I will let you attempt this, risky, reduced effect. God, I don’t even know what this would be in terms of an action.
Minna: [delighted] I don’t even know, my dude. Skirmish?
Rhi: Skirmish, maybe Finesse, uh…
Josie: Honestly, I could see a case for Sway.
Rhi: Yeah, I was gonna say. [laughs]
Minna: Yeah, I think it’s Sway.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Well, I rolled a crit.
Rhi: Are you fucking kidding me?
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: I rolled two dice and they both came up 6! The gods want this.
Rhi: Oh my God…
[laughter]
Kim: I love it.
Minna: You made a gamble and you lost.
Rhi: I did. I did! I got… yeah, no. I mean, I was literally sitting here being like the only way this is actually gonna work is if she gets a critical, which you did, so I am beholden to the promise I made myself.
Minna: [giggles]
Kim: I love it.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: So, describe what this…
Minna: [catching her breath, laughing]
Rhi: How do you do this?
Minna: Oh God.
Rhi: And then I will describe her reaction.
Minna: Okay, so I scatter basically a bunch of jacks on the floor.
Rhi: Well, so you’re on a roof.
Minna: On the roof.
Rhi: Yeah, I’m picturing that it’s a sloped roof and you all are kind of up on the top edge, so I think that they kind of scatter down and some of them catch on the tiles, and… I can’t believe this fucking worked.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Struggling with Minx, hears this clattering of many small objects, kind of looks away, does a double-take, shoves Minx away, and scurries after them and starts frantically collecting them, and you can hear muttering counting under her breath as she’s picking them up.
Kim: … You’re kidding.
Rhi: She got a critical. I have to… that particular…
Minna: [giggling] You didn’t have to make it work in the exact way.
Rhi: By virtue…
Kim: It’s just… no, I understand mechanically.
Rhi: By virtue of the dice, this has been willed into truth.
Kim: I understand the mechanics. The mental image is just extremely hilarious to me.
Minna: It’s amazing.
Rhi: I mean, it’s a silly superstition.
Minna: It’s the best.
Rhi: Because the thing that they usually would advise is to like dump rice on your porch and the vampire would have to sit there and count all the rice and then the sun would come up and they would burn.
Minna: Oh. Yeah, it’s a distraction, it’s not like a fix, so somebody has to capitalize on this.
Rhi: Yeah, this is distracting her, this is not solving the problem.
Josie: Uh-huh. Minx kinda just looks at Myra like, uh, what’s going on? [laughs]
Rhi: I feel like at this point that’s when it clicks for Blaire and Minx, because I think you would both be familiar with that particular piece of vampire legend where you’re like, wait, vampires do that, wait, she’s a vampire?!
Minna: Wait, did I just guess that she was a vampire? I’m sorry.
Josie: In that case, I have a very important Minx reaction.
Rhi: Uh-huh?
Josie (as Minx): Wait, Tesslyn, you’re a vampire now? What kind of self-respecting vampire looks like that? Where is your black lace high collar? Where is your crimson cape? I’m very disappointed in you.
Rhi: [laughs] What did you say that you had dropped, Minna?
Minna: Uh, basically…
Rhi: Like ball bearings, or tacks?
Minna: I’m just picturing them being like those jacks that you play kids’ games with. I don’t know why she has those on her person.
Rhi: Oh! Caltrops. Little pointy caltrops?
Minna: Yeah, I guess they’re caltrops.
Rhi: She has a handful of those, and she throws them at you, Minx.
Josie: [yelps] And yes, Minx, I feel like it fits her reckless nature to waste her action fretting over the fashion of the situation. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, goading the fucking vampire. So yeah, she throws them at you. I think you’re gonna take level 1 harm.
Josie: But I can resist that, right?
Rhi: You can, yeah. She’s throwing them with vampire strength, so like, it hits with a lot more speed and force than you would expect.
Josie: Oh geez. Yeah, I think I’m just gonna roll Prowess resist.
Josie (as Minx): Ah, not the face!
Rhi: Yeah, basically.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, so you manage to dodge out. You duck, and they go sailing over your head, but it was close.
Josie: Uh-huh. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, so… she is, for the moment, distracted. What would you like to do with this particular moment?
Josie: I think I wanna turn the tables, and knowing that the body she’s possessing is dead now, try and bulrush her off the roof. This may not go well.
Rhi: Okay. Mm-hmm.
Josie: I feel like this is a Wreck.
Rhi: Yeah, I’ll allow that.
Josie: And I’m gonna push myself on it.
Rhi: Okay, so this is gonna be risky, reduced effect.
Josie: Oh… You know what, I’m gonna push myself to increase effect instead.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: So, you bulrush her, and I think she had kinda gotten close to the edge of the roof, because some of these had slid down into the gutter, so you hit her and she starts to go over the side, and she grabs onto you to take you down with her.
Josie: Uh-oh.
Rhi: I think you manage to, as she’s trying to drag you down with her, scrabble around and grab onto the gutter, so you’re hanging onto the gutter with your hands and she’s hanging onto your legs.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: So you are in a desperate position, hanging on for dear life with a vampire on your legs.
Josie (as Minx): [yelps, breathes heavily] A bit of help, dears?
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] So, Myra, Blaire?
Kim: Yeah. Blaire’s gonna rush over to help, I just don’t know what that help looks like.
Rhi: Oh, what happened… Right, I forgot that there was another ghost flitting around up there too. That’ll come into play, I’m sure.
Kim: Oh right. Should I clean that up first before I help?
Rhi: I dunno. Do you want me to have it available as a potential consequence?
Kim: I do not! Okay, yeah, let me clean up that mess. Minna, are you okay with going after Josie?
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: [laughs] I feel like Blaire starts to run towards the edge of the roof and then gets really cold as this ghost moves in on her and she’s like AHH.
Kim: Yep, that’s exactly what happens.
Kim (as Blaire): AGH! Oh geez!
Kim: Totally forgot about it.
Rhi: Yeah, so did I.
Kim: Yeah, I’m just gonna push myself and roll Consort for this one, just try to talk it down.
Rhi: Talk it back into the jar? Yeah.
Kim: Like usual.
Rhi: It’s gonna be risky, standard effect for this since this is a regular old ghost.
Kim: Okay, great, a 4 and a 6.
Rhi: Six, okay. Yeah, I think it takes some coaxing, but you’re able to convince the ghost, like, no-no-no, back in the jar, I’m sorry.
Kim (as Blaire): Sweetheart. Sweetheart? Baby? [frustrated grumbling]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: It will eventually go back in the jar.
Kim (as Blaire): In! Now! Get in!
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: She’s just talking to it like a cat.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] So while Blaire is arguing with a ghost, Myra, what are you doing?
Minna: I am trying to haul Minx back over the edge of the roof.
Rhi: Okay. That is gonna be I think a Prowl, most likely.
Minna: Okie-doke.
Rhi: Risky position, and again, reduced effect, because you’re not just hauling Minx. She has another person.
Minna: Gonna push myself for better effect.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: That’s a 6.
Rhi: I mean, so you haul Minx up, but Tesslyn is still hanging onto her, so Tesslyn comes up too, and I think once she is within arm’s reach of the gutter kind of launches herself away from Minx and grabs the roof and pulls herself back up as well, and kinda moves a few steps away from you. It looks like she is regrouping the same way that you are as well at this point. So, you still have an angry vampire looking for revenge interfering with your ability to just steal a couple pieces of paper, and probably some other stuff. You were gonna lift some other stuff.
Josie: Uh-huh. Minx is gonna groan and be like:
Josie (as Minx): Ugh, at least you’re wearing a cloak while doing these acrobatics.
Rhi: Minx’s priorities are flawless, really.
Josie: Yeah, and she’s also maybe trying not to focus, the person she put a lot of emotional energy into killing is standing in front of her again.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah…
Josie: Anything to avoid revisiting the trauma. [laughs]
Rhi: Yep.
Josie: Huh… What do I want to do? So real quick, we’re on a sloped tiled roof?
Rhi: Basically.
Josie: Okay. I’m trying to think what I would reasonably have when preparing for a normal house heist that could be used to knock tiles loose.
Rhi: Burglary gear? That would have a crowbar.
Josie: Yeah. Yeah, you know what, crowbar time. Instead of attacking her I’m gonna take her footing away.
Rhi: Okay, so you’re gonna try and knock the tiles out from under her?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so this is still gonna be risky position, reduced effect. You’re basically dealing with a vampire, you’re kind of always gonna be at reduced effect.
Josie: Mm-hmm. [uneasy noises] That’s a 2.
Rhi: That is a 2. I’m gonna put this… I’m gonna crowdsource this one. So, vampires in Blades in the Dark feed on life essence, and stereotypically it would be by drinking blood, but most vampires actually do not. They drain life essence in other forms. It could be a particular emotion. It could be memories. It could be anything like that. It could be energy. What do we think Tesslyn feeds on?
Josie: Hmm…
Minna: Social power.
Josie: In that case I think maybe like fear or desperation?
Rhi: Yeah! Although I almost like the idea that… so, that she can temporarily damage your reputation. If she feeds on you, you just have this aura that people just don’t wanna talk to you as much, like they’re just put off from you.
Josie: She feeds on charisma.
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah. I like that. That’s really cool.
Josie: No! That makes her the bane of every single one of my characters.
Rhi: [laughs] I know!
Kim: [gritted groan]
Minna: That’s why she’s such a good nemesis for you.
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah.
Kim: You played yourself.
Rhi: So, and vampires, they also leave some kind of mark on their victims. You had gotten a 2, so I think you start trying to take out the tiles under her feet, you’re swinging this crowbar, and she kinda jumps backwards away from the tiles that you’re knocking down and then she just jumps and tackles you and pins you down and has her hand over your face.
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: And Minx, you can feel something being drained out of you. I think that you end up with, like…
Minna: Maybe just a lack of confidence behind the eyes?
Rhi: Yeah… Yeah.
Kim: Like a little bit glazed over maybe?
Rhi: Yeah, I think that works. I was trying to think of something that would kind of be representative of that off-putting feeling, so yeah, I think that it’s just like… yeah, when she pulls her hand away you can still see fine, Minx, but anybody who would be looking at you would see this glassy-eyed, a little bit unfocused, vacant expression to you. So you’re gonna take… this is gonna be level 2 harm, Charisma Drained basically. [laughs]
Josie: Uh, I’m gonna resist!
Rhi: Yeah. This is gonna be with Resolve.
Josie: Okay. Critical.
Rhi: Okay. You manage to partly fend this off. It’s gonna drop down to a level 1 harm, so you’re gonna be at reduced effect on anything that’s gonna be based on your ability to be charming and sociable.
Josie: Right. I also heal a point of stress.
Rhi: Yeah, you also overcome a point of stress. Tell me, how does that work? How do you mentally fight this off?
Josie: Well, I think it’s just raw force of vanity.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: [laughing] Just like, you will never take my charm!
Kim: Just absolute petty…
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: [laughs] I love that. That’s very good.
Josie: Like, Minx’s voice is a little softer and a little harder to make out, but she’s like:
Josie (as Minx): You don’t even drink blood. What? You’re such a shitty vampire.
[laughter]
Kim: That’s not what vampires do in this setting!
Josie: But it’s what we understand them to do.
Rhi: I love the idea that Minx has read a bunch of trashy dime novel vampire stories.
Minna: Oh no.
Kim: Yes!
Josie: Oh yes.
Rhi: And that is 100% her conception of what they’re supposed to be, and she’s so disappointed!
Josie: Yes.
Minna: I feel like she’s read, like, what is it… Anne Rice books of Duskwall?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, of course. Now, we can go full-on, we can get pretty close to Twilight here. Minx doesn’t have—
Minna: Oh my God.
Rhi: [cackles]
Kim: Why not?! Sure.
Josie: Minx doesn’t have standards when it comes to romance novels.
Minna: [claps and laughs]
Kim: There’s definitely a Twilight equivalent of a young adult tragic vampire versus werewolf kind of thing in this setting.
Rhi: Oh my God… Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, of course.
Rhi: Oh my God. Yeah.
Josie: Like, the one standard she has is make it gay or make things ambiguous enough that she can squint her eyes and make it gay. That’s her one standard. [laughs]
Rhi: Jesus. Okay! So Minx got jumped by this vampire and had her charisma partially drained. Blaire, Myra, Minx is being pinned down by vampire Tesslyn. She still has her hand over Minx’s face, and Minx is just kind of flailing and yelling at her about how she’s a shitty vampire who has no fashion.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: What would you two like to do?
Kim: At this point would you say I’ve completely gotten the ghost in the jar now?
Rhi: Yes.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, you got a 5 or a 6 on that roll previously, so you’re good.
Kim: This is gonna end so poorly, because I’m so squishy, but would you say Tesslyn is distracted enough that I could sneak up behind her and I could try to do a stab?
Rhi: You can try, yeah.
Kim: I feel like Prowl makes the most sense to sneak up to her to do a stab.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, if you are trying to do an ambush…
Kim: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m doing.
Rhi: …Prowl is good.
Kim: Um… Devil’s Bargain?
Rhi: I think that you’re gonna, in whatever ends up happening here, you end up losing the blade that you use.
Kim: Eh, that’s fine.
Rhi: Like, you’ll be able to replace it before your next score, but you will not have access to it for the rest of this one.
Kim: That’s okay.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Yeah, I think it’s a pretty expendable blade that Blaire brings along with her for this and not any of her fancy ritual ones.
Rhi: [chuckles]
Kim: Okay, that’s a 5.
Rhi: Okay. So, where on her person are you trying to stab her?
Kim: You know, I can just super picture Blaire just, like, spider-monkeying onto her back and trying to go for the neck.
Rhi: Okay!
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: I like that. Yeah. So, you jump on her and start trying to stab her in the neck. She jerks upright, releasing Minx, which is a bonus. You do manage to slash her across the side of the neck, once, before she grabs you by the wrist and twists your wrist really sharply and forces you to drop the blade, and it goes skittering off and falls off the roof.
Kim: [seethes] Uh-huh. Right.
Rhi: And then while still holding your wrist she just grabs you and throws you, just across the roof.
Kim: Off—?
Rhi: Not off the roof.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: No, you were rolling risky not desperate. Desperate would be clear off the roof.
Kim: Yeah. [laughs] Just YEET.
Rhi: Yeah, she yeets you across the roof, and you are gonna take level 2 harm, Battered, as you’ve just been hurled, and your wrist is messed up, you’ve been thrown across a roof, you’re just in bad shape physically.
Kim: What can I roll to resist that?
Rhi: Prowess.
Kim: Okay, 2, 1, 5.
Rhi: Five, okay, you’ll take 1 stress and you can reduce that to level 1 harm.
Kim: All right.
Rhi: So, I think what Minx and Myra notice is that cut on her neck, it’s not really bleeding. I mean, it looks like she cut a corpse.
Kim: Oh! That’s so cool.
Rhi: Bothering her some, she kinda puts her hand over it, but it’s not bleeding.
Kim: Huh.
Rhi: So Myra, I believe you have not acted recently if you’d like to try and do something to deal with this situation.
Minna: Okie-doke, um… [whispering] I don’t know what to do with a vampire.
Josie: I mean, normally my answer would be smooch but not in this case.
[laughter]
Rhi: Unfortunately no.
Minna: I feel like we need a plan.
Rhi: So, this came up a little bit earlier. Part of the traditional vampire lore is that they were harmed by sunlight.
Minna: Yeah, that’s what I’m trying to think of. I think I’m going to try the classic “fire barrier” which I use entirely too much.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. It’s a solid one.
Minna: So I do have a lantern, so let me mark that off. I’m going to try spilling lamp oil in an arc between her and us and lighting it on fire, preferably caging her in on her end of the roof.
Rhi: Okay!
Minna: That’s… What is that going to be?
Rhi: I would say Finesse potentially. That sounds like something that is gonna require some pretty precise aiming and movements.
Minna: Google’s dice roller really likes me. I just critted, again.
Rhi: Again?
Kim: Again?!
Rhi: Good lord… Um, okay. Yeah, I’m gonna just say tell me how you manage to use this fire to drive her off.
Minna: I think actually it does mean she can’t surge towards us. I run towards the edge of the roof and start an arc there, and just like, I’m spilling the oil, shaking it out, and it’s in a half circle around her with the open end on the edge of the roof, and then I set it on fire, and I don’t know how she reacts because that’s up to you.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that she’s lunging for you and then the fire goes and it just flares upwards, and I think this is a little bit similar to the counting thing where she hasn’t been a vampire for very long, she is still learning what she can and cannot do. Things she can do: drain people of their charisma and jump like two blocks in a single bound.
Minna: Hmm!
Rhi: Things she can’t do: resist the urge to count and pass through fire. I think that she just instinctively recoils and hisses, and I think as she’s doing that her cloak kind of flairs out and the edge of her cloak catches fire and she just panics. I think she just jumps away to a different roof, and you can see her, kind of, the flame trailing behind her. I think half way down the next roof she just rips the cloak off and leaves it behind. She just books it. You are now standing on a roof that’s on fire. The roof that she jumped onto, also on fire. Oh… Hmm. Somebody tell me odds or evens.
Kim: Evens.
Rhi: [rolls] All right, you’re in luck. She did not set the house that you’re trying to get into on fire.
Josie: That’s good!
Rhi: [laughs] I was just like, y’all were next door to that, she could have jumped onto his house.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: But I decided to give it a 50/50 chance, and she did not, so she is fleeing away. There’s two rooves that are on fire now but not the one that you need. The house you need is currently not on fire.
Kim: How are we breaking in?
Rhi: You were gonna try and go in through a second story window.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: The classic.
Kim: Well, we’re already on the roof. We can just—And I still have my climbing gear, so should we just jump over the roof and then climb into the window, second story?
Minna: Yes.
Josie: Yeah, let’s freaking do it.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: Yeah, okay. I think I’m gonna need a roll for that whole maneuver.
Minna: I can lead a group action.
Kim: Please, yeah.
Josie: Cool.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Group Prowl probably?
Rhi: Yes, and this is gonna be… I think it’s gonna be controlled position, standard effect.
Josie: Well, I got a 2 again.
Minna: I got a 4.
Kim: Phew, okay, I got a 6.
Rhi: Heh. So, Myra’s gonna take 1 stress, but you do it. You all, using ropes and stuff, are able to jump across, climb down, I think pop a top floor window and climb inside. I think that as you get inside you start to hear shouting from the street outside, people being like “oh God, fire, fire! Call for the Brigade!” So people outside are reacting to the fire now.
Josie: Oh geez.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie (as Minx): Uh, let’s make this quick.
Minna (as Myra): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Yep.
Josie: Minx is grumbling the whole time about Tesslyn being back and her being a shitty vampire and draining my gorgeous beauty and not even taking blood, and I wanted to be pinned down by a vampire but not like this, and fuck her, and I killed her, and she was supposed to be dead…
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Aww.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, Minx… Minx?
Josie (as Minx): Huh?
Kim (as Blaire): We can rant about Tesslyn after the score.
Josie (as Minx): Very well, dears. Very well.
Kim (as Blaire): Mm-hmm.
Josie (as Minx): Business first.
Kim: Blaire’s just gonna pat her on the shoulder, like there-there.
Josie: Aw. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay, so just as a refresher, your plan had been that you were just gonna kinda ransack the place to make it look like it was just a standard break-in so it wouldn’t be as obvious that you had taken the deed, so if you all still wanna do that…
Minna: Yes.
Josie: Yeah. Ransacking!
Minna: I think we should locate the deed first before ransacking.
Josie: I mean, yeah, probably.
Rhi: Yeah. Can I get odds or evens again from somebody?
Minna: Odds.
Rhi: Odds? All right, Minna said odds. Okay, once again you’re in luck, he’s not home.
Josie: No, no, no!
Minna: Never tell me the odds.
Josie: You can’t tell us the odds.
Minna: [laughs] Thank you!
Kim: Aaah!
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Very good.
Rhi: [sighs] Anyway. Okay, so he is not home, and I’m gonna say you all can make some rolls to find the deed. It is reasonable to assume it’s in his study.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So I will give you that, but you’re gonna have to spend some time searching.
Minna: I will happily Study about it.
Josie: Same.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead. This is gonna be, for the moment, controlled. Four for Josie. What did you get?
Minna: Well I got a 2.
Rhi: Two, okay.
Josie: Oh no.
Rhi: So the result of that, of those two rolls combined, is… yeah. Minx finds the deed. One of the bottom drawers on the desk is locked, but it’s a super cheap lock that you can basically just brute force open.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Rifle through the papers, find the deed, awesome. As you find it, you can kind of hear distantly the clanging bells of the Brigade approaching and more shouting outside. It seems like the fire that Myra set is spreading.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So, I’m starting a clock.
Kim: Why?
Rhi: Because they’re fun.
Kim: [stammers, indignant hum]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: One out of 5, the Brigade and the Bluecoats arrive on the scene.
Kim: [growls]
Rhi: So that is where you’re at, at this moment. You’ve got the deed, though. You could just go now, or you can take some extra time to try to ransack the place, cover this up.
Josie: I think we have time to shove things in a sack.
Kim: Oh yeah, absolutely, sure we do.
Rhi: Okay! Yeah. Go ahead and everybody… I’m imagining that you’re all gonna kind of fan out for this.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, so each of you give me some kind of roll for how you are going about the ransacking.
Josie: I am going to roll Wreck, because I’m not being subtle or careful about it.
Rhi: Yep, that makes sense.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Minx, I think you, because you used Wreck, you’re at a little bit of a penalty in terms of how much valuables you’re actually able to acquire, because you are mostly focused on breaking things, I think. You basically end up only grabbing 1 coin worth of stuff, but you do a fucking number on this place. Knocking things over, furniture thrown askew, clothes ripped out of wardrobes. You throw open the cabinets and start breaking plates, because why not. You’ve got some complicated angry feelings to work out.
[laughter]
Rhi: You lay down a lot of mess to confuse any future investigation, so in that you are highly effective. Who wants to go next, Myra or Blaire?
Minna: I’m gonna go ahead and Study about it, because I wanna look for valuables and do precision strikes on those.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: [sighs] I just rolled another 2.
Rhi: Yeah, I think on a 2 you spend a lot of time. I think I’m also gonna give you a one die roll on that to see how much coin you get. Also only 1 coin worth of stuff. I think that you just get caught up in looking at some of his business papers trying to figure out what this guy’s deal is. Maybe there’s something useful you can take back to Nicholas… but you get distracted. You only manage to grab one small valuable, and it takes time, so we’re ticking that clock up again.
Minna: Yep.
Rhi: Now at 2 out of 5. Blaire?
Kim: You know, I don’t actually picture Blaire being too strategic about it either, so I think I actually want to roll Wreck as well, even though I have nothing in it and I don’t think I’ve ever rolled Wreck before, ever.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it. Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Okay, that’s a 4.
Rhi: You also are kind of following Minx’s model of breaking shit, but you’re actually looking at stuff before you break it.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Rolled a 6. So you find something that’s worth 3 coin.
Kim: Ooh, okay.
Rhi: I don’t know what that something is, or it might be multiple somethings, but you find loot that is worth 3 coin.
Kim: Cursed object please?
Rhi: I mean, one of it can be a cursed object. Sure.
Kim: Yay.
Rhi: You got a 4, you said?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: We’re gonna tick the clock up once more.
Kim: What’s the clock at now?
Rhi: It is at 3 out of 5.
Kim: Ugh, okay.
Rhi: But you have thoroughly trashed this place, between Blaire and Minx this looks pretty bad, but at this point the clanging bells of the Brigade and the Bluecoats are getting louder. You can hear people shouting outside. It sounds like people are trying to organize a bucket brigade to start dealing with it. Myra has just probably burned down an innocent bystander’s home.
Minna: In my defense, there was a vampire~
Rhi: I mean, these things happen. Yeah, so if you all are good with your loot, do you wanna just book it?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: I think that since they’re still two ticks away on the clock and you all do have in your crew equipment from your Shadows days you do still have those maps for underground passages and things, I think that you’re able to just slip down into the catacombs and make your way back across Nightmarket that way.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: So yeah, you got the deed, you got some goods. I’m imagining, and you all can correct me if this is wrong, but I’m imagining you would probably go straight to The Hound’s Paw to give the deed to Nicholas so he can start working his lawyerly magic?
Kim & Josie: Yes.
Rhi: All right. So, it’s you know, fairly late in the evening, I think, when you get there. The Hound’s Paw looks kind of like it has for the last few times that you’ve stopped in, only a couple lights on, everything else is closed up. The front door’s open, and I think that—Who is taking the lead here? Who goes in first?
Josie: I’m gonna go in first.
Rhi: Okay. So Minx, you open up the door, and you see at the table that Nicholas has been sitting at, he’s sitting there, his papers have kind of been sorted off to the side, and he’s sitting there across the table from Rigney, and the two of them are, you know, sitting there chatting. They’ve got a bottle of wine between the two of them that’s about half empty.
Minna: [as a giggle] Aww~
Rhi: They’re laughing about something, and they both kind of look up in surprise when Minx bursts in.
Josie: [smiling] Minx just gives like a Cheshire smile and delivers the paper to Nick.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Nicholas): Oh, perfect. This is perfect. Why do you all smell like smoke?
Josie (as Minx): It’s best not to inquire about these things, dear.
Kim (as Blaire): Occupational hazard.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. Rigney is like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Trust me, the less you know the better. It’s just overall better for your health.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Well, I will trust the expert on this one.
Rhi: Winks at him. Rigney? Visibly blushing.
Minna: Oh my gosh!
Josie: Aw!
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I think Minx has her hands to her cheeks again, and is just like [squirms happily].
Rhi: He is trying to play it off like it’s not happening, like he’s not reacting to it at all, but like…
Minna: [laughing] I think Myra very gently elbows Minx.
Rhi: [giggles]
Josie (as Minx): Oh, yes, ahem. Well, hopefully this is enough to make our case.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Yes, yes. I had a lot of the paperwork prepped already. I just need to fill in some blanks, and this will help me do that, and then I will file some things in the morning, and… yeah. It’s gonna take a few more days I think, but this will at least delay the proceedings. You won’t be evicted tomorrow.
Rhi: He says to Rigney, who looks very relieved.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Yeah, I think that there’s gonna be some arguing back and forth, lots of paperwork, but I’m pretty confident that I can get ownership transferred to Caelan here.
Josie (as Minx): Do we get to observe?
Rhi (as Nicholas): Oh, it’s not really going to be—it’s not that sort of court trial thing.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, I see.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Yes, it’s just me and opposing council sitting in a conference room shouting at each other and quoting different legal precedent.
Josie (as Minx): I see. I do miss courtroom drama, though.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Nicholas): When would you have been involved in any kind of courtroom proceedings? Were you sued?
Minna (as Myra): You’d be surprised.
Kim (as Blaire): Mmm!
Rhi: [laughing] Rigney is once again just vigorously shaking his head and being like:
Josie (as Minx): We walk in many circles.
Rhi (as Rigney): You don’t wanna know.
Rhi: [laughs] I think Nicholas just kinda looks from Rigney to the three of you, back to Rigney.
Rhi (as Nicholas): I… am going to assume that yes, I am better off not knowing the details. Thank you for getting this. Once this is all cleared up I will collect my fee.
Josie (as Minx): I’m gonna go get cleaned up and try not to have nightmares about vampires.
Josie: Then she’ll turn to Rigney and wink knowingly. [laughs]
Minna: What?!
Josie: And then head out the door.
Rhi: [laughing] Rigney barely notices.
Rhi (as Rigney): Vampire? Vampire? Minx? Minx, what are you talking about?!
[laughter]
Rhi: Minx is already gone.
Josie (as Minx): Better off not to know~
Kim (as Blaire): No, Rigney… Rigs, you probably should know about this.
Rhi (as Rigney): Yeah, I was going to ask. Is this something that’s going to cause problems for me?
Kim (as Blaire): No, it shouldn’t, for you.
Rhi (as Rigney): I didn’t think vampires were real…
Kim (as Blaire): Well they are! I could actually tell you a lot about them if you’d like.
Rhi (as Rigney): I… Nope. I just need to know if it’s gonna cause a problem for me and my establishment, and the people who visit my establishment or who work here.
Kim (as Blaire): No. No, we are going to do everything that we can to keep tabs on her.
Rhi: [laughs] Nicholas is just sitting there, like staring at all of you.
Kim: [laughs]
Minna: Yeah, I think Myra’s gonna turn to him and say:
Minna (as Myra): If this leaks, we do know who we’ve told about this.
Rhi (as Nicholas): Uh… right, yes. No, you do not seem like the sort of people I want to cross, and also you’re friends of Caelan’s here, and I—
Kim (as Blaire): First name basis! Rigs!
Rhi: Rigney is just like:
Rhi (as Rigney): Uh, I think you have somewhere that you need to be now, Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… Oh! Oh.
Kim: Blaire is putting two and two together.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay!
[laughter]
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah! Yeah, okay. Um… Have a good time. We’ll be seeing you.
Rhi: [delighted] Oh my God. This poor man. He’s just trying to have a date. He hasn’t been on a date in so long, you guys.
Minna: The single dad life takes a toll on him.
Rhi: Yep. So the three of you head out. I think that, Myra, just as you pull the door closed you hear Rigney just kind of burst into hysterical laughter.
Minna: [laughs] Listen, if you meet a cute guy through the Magpies it will be chaotic.
Rhi: Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.
## Downtime [1:22:36]
Rhi: So, the magpies all head back to The Nest and clean up and stash their ill-gotten loot, and then as they often do kind of drift apart to take care of themselves and recover in various ways from the score. Some of that recovery is physical, some of it is mental and emotional. While Myra and Minx are off elsewhere in the city, where do we find Blaire?
Kim: So, Blaire as usual is in her room where she usually just works, because that’s the only space available to her to safely work, especially with extremely experimental and unstable projects such as this. Blaire is working on the final stages of the first tests for her recovering ghosts long-term project.
I imagine that there are just several vials and flasks scattered across the floor – she’s working on the floor as she usually does – and just very carefully putting one drop into another. If there’s any reaction she records it, but there are I would say two concoctions that she hasn’t tried yet, and she’s deliberately kind of saving that for last for the evening, because she knows those are the two most volatile. Her research suggests that it could give the most promising result that she’s hoping for, but it’s also very dangerous, so I think she’s deliberately kind of procrastinating on that one.
Rhi: Yeah, and I think though that eventually she kind of has to make a decision of either I put this all away and I call it a night and I put off these last two until another day, or… I just do it.
Kim: And I think she’s probably too wired up to sleep anyway. I feel like if she went to bed now it would just be nudging at her and she wouldn’t be able to get to sleep. Yeah, I think she’s just gonna do it.
Rhi: Yeah. So again, kind of taking these different mixtures of ghost drugs that she’s obtained and other things, alchemicals that she has devised, and starts combining them, and one of the vials that you have, when you add some of the mixture that you’ve made to the ghost drugs, it starts vibrating in your hands, the flask.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Does Blaire hold onto it or does she set it down when that starts?
Kim: When it’s vibrating? I think she’s still holding on.
Rhi: Okay. Then, it gets really cold in your hands, and you know, I think you’ve probably been looking into the ghost field this whole time. You can see the rough shape of what looks like a spirit, or spirit energy at least, pouring out of this thing.
Kim: Right, just like fragments of it just trying to coalesce into something?
Rhi: Mm-hmm. For a moment, Blaire thinks that this worked. She’s watching in the ghost field and she sees these fragments start to come together, taking on a humanoid shape. You can see a head and a torso and limbs, and for one second Blaire is just like, I did it, I actually did it.
But then it keeps going, it keeps growing. There are too many limbs and too many heads sprouting off of this thing, and suddenly every last one of those heads that have grown off of this spirit opens their mouths and lets out this horrible gut-wrenching wail, and it doesn’t stop, and it’s getting louder and louder, and it just feels like this sound is clawing at the inside of Blaire’s skull.
Kim: I feel as though Blaire, in her back pocket, has some sort of last-ditch effort if she, back against the wall, cannot calm down a feral ghost. She basically has some kind of kill-all missile, like not a spirit bane charm but something that can actually destroy a ghost.
Rhi: Okay, something based on the stuff that the Spirit Wardens use.
Kim: Yes, and I don’t think she ever carries it on her person, I think it’s just something that she keeps in her room in case something ever goes wrong in the house kind of thing. So, Blaire is going to reach for that and use that.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m imagining that it’s kind of a powder…
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: …and I think it sort of hits this spirit and the shrieking intensifies for a couple seconds, and then the spirit kind of folds in on itself and seems like it’s imploding and just kind of collapses down into just this, for a second, this single bright point of spirit energy, and then it winks out.
Kim: Blaire is just like on her knees, and I think it’s just silent in the room for maybe one minute before she just keels over and just is sobbing, because I don’t think she’s ever had to do that before in The Nest, or ever, but she just got so panicked she didn’t know what was going to happen, and it’s just now hitting her, like oh my God, I killed a ghost, which goes against her entire ethos as a person.
Rhi: I think that in all this chaos that had happened you had a vial of salt water, Void Sea water, on a shelf, that I think as you were scrambling for this kill switch you knocked to the floor. Blaire doesn’t notice it, but that little puddle of sea water starts to bubble, and then I think what we see is just, you know, Blaire is on the floor weeping and a hand, surprisingly gentle, probably gentler than Blaire has ever experienced from Setarra, rests on her shoulder, and you hear a familiar voice say:
Rhi (as Setarra): I told you it was a waste of your time. It’s remarkable really how someone so clever can be so foolish at the same time.
Kim (as Blaire): [crying] I didn’t want to kill it. I didn’t want to.
Rhi (as Setarra): Sometimes you find yourself in situations where you have to make difficult choices, and you, unfortunately, walked into this situation yourself.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t understand. You weren’t there. I was this close. [sobbing] I was so close! I could have saved it.
Rhi (as Setarra): It didn’t look that way from what I saw. Blaire, you are clever, you are brilliant, but you must focus your brilliance on the things that matter. This project of yours was doomed to failure from the start, and I indulged it because I knew it would teach you a lesson. Your attention must stay on things where you can succeed, where you can make a difference.
Rhi: From somewhere in her dress of water she produces a book. It’s a familiar book. It’s one that the two of you had been working on for a long time about summoning things from other realms. She just kind of holds it out to you.
Rhi (as Setarra): Do you want your name to go down in history, Blaire? Do you want to be known for your brilliance, for your discoveries?
Kim (as Blaire): [sniffles]
Rhi (as Setarra): This is how you do it.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: She will offer you a hand up.
Kim: Blaire takes it.
Rhi (as Setarra): When you’ve rested we should get back to work.
Kim (as Blaire): Let’s do it.

"Season 3, Episode 19: The Ghostly Secrets Score, Part 1 Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter)
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. We are fast approaching the end of Season 3. It’s awesome to have all of you along with us on this wild journey, and all your support, whether it be through Patreon, Twitter, or leaving reviews, is very much appreciated. No real announcements today, so we’re going to go straight into Kim telling us about this month’s featured charity.
Kim: I want all of our listeners to know that everyone behind The Magpies podcast believes in and supports the Black Lives Matter movement. Black lives have always mattered. They mattered yesterday, they matter today, they will matter tomorrow, and they will continue to matter every single day afterwards.
In honor of the nationwide uprisings happening in the US at the time of this recording and also in honor of Pride Month, we are featuring the National Black Justice Coalition as this month’s charity. THE NBJC is a civil rights organization that works to empower black LGBTQIA+ people. They work to increase education on HIV and AIDs in the African American community, encourage historically black colleges to create a safe environment for their gay and trans students, support non-traditional queer families, and so much more. To learn more about what they do and to donate, please visit NBJC.org.
To all of our black listeners, we see you, we love you, and we stand beside you. We are with you in this fight. Black lives matter.
Rhi: I’m gonna keep this call to action short today. All I ask is that in between whatever else you’re able to do, protesting or volunteering or calling your reps or donating or just getting through the day, in between all that take a few minutes to do something nice for yourself. It’s really hard absorbing everything that’s happening in the world, living with it, getting up every day and figuring out what battles have to be fought. So, if you can, try to give yourself some kindness. We all need it these days.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [00.02.20]
Rhi: So, we open up on a close-up of a book. A thick textbook with very fine print. And on one page, taking up about, like, a third of the page, is this sort of like exploded diagram of a metallic structure that has all of those little very fine labels of, like, you know, item A, Item B. And we see as we pull back, Myra is leaning over this textbook, reading very closely, sitting in a now-familiar small study room in the library at Doskvol Academy. And sitting across from her, engaged in a book of his own, scribbling down some notes, is Jeren.
And it just kinda has that comfortable silence to it of just, sort of, when you and somebody else are each doing your own thing but you’re doing it together. And I think after a little bit of this kind of comfortable silence, Jeren sits up and stretches and the, like, his spine cracking is audible. He kinda makes a face.
Rhi (as Jeren): Ooh, sorry.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs] Maybe you should get up and take a little walk.
Rhi (as Jeren): Maybe. Ah, you’d think I’d be better at being hunched over a desk, since I’ve made a career out of it.
Minna (as Myra): Oh, that just means your spine has more time to hate it, right?
Rhi (as Jeren): [laughs] Yes. How’s your thing going?
Minna (as Myra): It’s going pretty well, in so far as… it’s not a fun subject, but it’s going.
Rhi (as Jeren): Yeah. Well, uh, I will continue to not ask for details. Um, I think I am gonna take you up on that walk. Anything you want me to grab you?
Minna (as Myra): No, I should be okay, thank you.
Rhi (as Jeren): Alright.
Rhi: I think he kinda, you know, stands up and rolls his shoulders back and will make his way out. And I think Myra may not see this, but he kinda, like, starts to glance at the book you’re reading and then, like, very pointedly makes himself look away. And he will slip out the door and leave Myra to her research. So, from the library we fade out and then fade back in on Nyryx’s apartment. So, my mind went to Nyryx is in a robe with her hair down… [laughs]
Josie: Yay!
Rhi: And what state is Minx in?
Josie: I think she’s in the state of gay silence.
[laughter]
Rhi: I meant in terms of how clothed is she.
Josie: Oh, I see.
Rhi: [laughs] She can still be in a state of gay silence.
Josie: I think she’s just, like, only slightly undressed. I think she’s let her hair down and stuff and, like, loosened her collar, that sort of thing. But otherwise, yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. Nyryx comes back over to the table with, you know, a couple mugs of tea and sits down and has, you know, her furrowed brow, looking very worried. And is just like:
Rhi (as Nyryx): [sighs] You know, the worst part of it is I… I can’t even really say that I’m surprised. She’d always had an interest in that sort of thing that we all just sort of ignored.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. And given her style, I guess it’s something we should have seen coming. Although she is not leaning into the aesthetic of the thing at all and it’s very disappointing in a nemesis.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [laughs] Of course that’s what you’d be worried about.
Josie (as Minx): Listen, it’s either I think about that or think of the more existential problems with that. And I don’t wanna think about that, dear.
Rhi: She reaches across the table and squeezes your hand.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I don’t really know what to do about that. I suppose I can reinforce the wards on my place, or maybe see if Blaire can stop by sometime to do a bit of touching up as well, make sure she doesn’t come after me to try and get at you.
Josie (as Minx): Honestly, I don’t think it changes all that much. We’re gonna be relying on Blaire quite a bit for this. And she’s stronger, yes, but also much more limited. And she’s not leaning over your shoulder 24 hours a day, so—
Rhi (as Nyryx): And I suppose if I just keep a bag of tacks or rice around… I can’t believe that that’s a real thing.
Josie (as Minx): I— I would have not have called that one either.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi (as Nyryx): It’s just… there were some other ones that I would have guessed much before the counting fixation, but…
Josie (as Minx): I was bemoaning my lack of garlic.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [laughs] Well, I suppose you’ll have to start carrying some so you can test that theory if you cross paths with her again. Although, well, I suppose it is a bit too much to hope that she won’t come after you again.
Josie (as Minx): Honestly, if she comes after me, she’s coming after The Magpies. And together we can handle her, I think. My means of practice did just get limited. Find another means of combating her.
Rhi (as Nyryx): What do you mean?
Josie (as Minx): Oh, I maybe overdid it at the, um, you know, the club. The swordplay club….
Rhi (as Nyryx): [sighs]
Josie (as Minx): The underground one. I’m not gonna call it a pit, cause you know me, I would never be caught dead in a pit.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, I’m afraid that most of the fencers and swordfighters that I know are either, well, you or people who are involved in that sort of organization. I don’t really know… do you want to—
Josie (as Minx): Oh—
Rhi (as Nyryx): Hmm?
Josie (as Minx): You needn’t come up with— for a replacement on my account for my own vices.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I want to help. I can’t really do much to help with most of what you do, but…
Josie: Minx squeezes Nyryx’s hand back.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, do you think you want to find somewhere else where you can practice sword fighting, or maybe some other ways of defending yourself?
Josie (as Minx): Well, I did have aspirations of training at that one college run by the Red Sashes, but Bazso kind of took that out.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Mm, yes he did.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, good for him. It’s just an unfortunate side effect.
Rhi (as Nyryx): [sighs] Yes, and I doubt that the embassy is going to just welcome random passers-by who are interested in learning their techniques.
Josie (as Minx): Mm hmm.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I could ask around and see if I can find someone who’s maybe doing private lessons. It’d be a little more expensive, but…
Josie (as Minx): If you know anyone, I would welcome that. And to be frank, given the situation, I probably shouldn’t be leaning on fighting for stress relief. I should be taking it seriously.
Rhi (as Nyryx): That’s true. And you should be doing something to relax that’s actually relaxing.
Josie (as Minx): Yeah. I mean, I do work for The Weeping Lady and I suppose there will be more time for that now.
Rhi (as Nyryx): That’s true, but— and it is good that you’re helping others, but that’s not really taking time for yourself, dear.
Josie (as Minx): Ultimately this Circle of Flame business will be over eventually, and then I imagine I can have some time for myself. I’d rather that time go to you or The Magpies in the meantime.
Rhi: Well, I think she will, like, pick up your hand and kiss your knuckles.
Josie: [squeals]
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Minx blushes.
Rhi: And just say:
Rhi (as Nyryx): Well, since you’re here, may as well make good use of the time.
Rhi: Wink.
Josie: [laughs] Minx will smile and pull her closer.
Rhi: [laughs] Yep. And we will fade out on that.
Josie: Yay.
Rhi: They’re so cute.
Josie: Yeah!
Rhi: And then we’re gonna fade in on Blaire. Where do we find Blaire?
Kim: Um, Blaire is in the library of the Scurlock Estate and she is seated at a table pouring over a book. And she is just surrounded by towers of books and so much paper and multiple inkwells, I would say.
Rhi: [laughs] And I think that hovering anxiously is Oskar Scurlock, who manages the estate on his uncle’s behalf. And he’s just sort of peering over at the books that you’ve picked up. You know, this is the library that Blaire has permission to be in. There are others in the estate. So, Blaire is here researching. I think that she has— she didn’t bring the summoning book, I think Setarra has been holding onto that. But she has some notes and she knows what she’s looking for.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: And what she’s looking for is basically bait. In order to lure something from another reality, another dimension, another plane of existence, you know, these rituals need something to grab its attention and bring it through to your reality.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Setarra had given a few suggestions for things that could possibly work as bait, and one of the things that she had said is that if you summon something that is a predator, if you can find something of its prey, that will draw it through. So Blaire, you have been searching through. I don’t think that this is— I think coming to Scurlock’s library actually may have been kind of one of your last-ditch attempts.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: At finding something. Because you’ve gone through all of your books. You even, you stopped by the Historical Society’s library to see if they had anything. They did not.
Kim: Yeah. Reconciled probably have nothing on this.
Rhi: Uh, The Reconciled had a little information on these sort of rituals, but they started asking a lot of very pointed questions when you were inquiring about those books and didn’t really want to share it with you.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So, now you’re here.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: With Oskar Scurlock hovering as you are taking notes. And Blaire, what you have found in Scurlock’s records is something called the Archive of Echoes.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: And the Archive of Echoes is a… it’s basically kind of an Imperial ministry.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: There are archives in most of the major cities of The Imperium and these archives have special dispensation from The Emperor himself to basically ignore the rules of The Spirit Wardens and the Church, to keep ghosts that they can consult with.
Kim: Oh my God, this is so cool.
Rhi: There is an Archive of Echoes here in Duskwall. Generally, the spirits kept in the Archives are extremely ancient. The idea is that by keeping these ancient spirits, chief scholars of each Archive can consult with these ancient spirits for advice about what’s currently happening, get sort of those direct historical connections to understand what’s going on in the world presently. The Archive of Echoes in Duskwall is run by one Lord Penderyn.
Kim: oh no.
Rhi: Yes, you know the name Penderyn, because Lady Penderyn is a member of the Circle of Flame.
Kim: Ah.
Rhi: Scurlock, somewhat unsurprisingly, has an interest in the Archive of Echoes. And he has, you know, there’s a lot of tomes that have information about the archives. And there are some notes and things in some of these books and histories that indicate that in addition to the ancient ghosts, the Archives hold other very powerful occult relics. And you’re able to piece together, like, it’s kind of talked around sideways, they don’t really spell it out directly, but it definitely seems like there are relics of things from other realities. From past things that have been summoned. So, I think that you have enough information here to know that your best bet for finding what you need for this ritual is gonna be the archive of echoes in Duskwall. And I think Oskar will kind of lean over and be like:
Rhi (as Oskar): Um… Miss? Are you close to being done?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, yes. Yes I am, actually. I just need to take a few more notes.
Rhi (as Oskar): Alright. It’s just that it’s, um, well, it’s been about five hours.
Kim (as Blaire): Really?
Rhi (as Oskar): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. [stammers]
Kim: I think there’s, like, a grandfather clock somewhere in the library, and she looks at it and she’s just like:
Kim (as Blaire): Oh… huh.
Rhi: [laughs]
Rhi (as Oskar): Yes. Uh… yes. Not to rush you or anything, you are a guest of my uncle’s, but I do have other things that I need to see to today and I cannot leave you unsupervised, so…
Kim (as Blaire): Of course, of course, yes. No, I really appreciate your time. I did not mean to stay this late. It’s just that— you know how it is. Time flies when you’re having fun. So, um…
Rhi and Josie: [laugh]
Rhi: He actually nods in understanding, like, this is Scurlock’s nephew. He’s also a goth nerd.
Kim: [laughs and claps]
Rhi: He gets it.
Kim: Yay, goth nerds.
Rhi: So, I think we see a little while later, Blaire leaving the front door of the estate, Oskar shutting the door behind her. I think Blaire, like, it’s that thing where like her satchel just has papers, like, sticking out of it. It’s just so stuffed with notes.
Kim: Yeah, she’s definitely, like, carrying multiple notebooks. She looks like a college campus student.
Rhi: Yeah. She just, like, all she needs is a piece of toast in her mouth.
Kim: Yes, exactly.
Rhi: And he’s running late for class.
Kim: Yes, absolutely.
Rhi: So, yeah. I think, you know, Blaire leaves Scurlock manor and makes her way back down through Six Towers to The Nest. I’m gonna say that it’s about dinnertime when she gets back in. I think Minx and Myra have both returned from their various visits today. What are Myra and Minx up to at this point?
Josie: I think Minx is writing some letters.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: I think one of them is to the cult she likes to hang out with, and another is potentially to a sword fighting mentor.
Rhi: Got it. Writing a cover letter. [laughs]
Josie: Yes.
Minna: I don’t know why, but I feel like Myra’s standing on a stool, dusting the hard-to-reach places with, like, an apron to protect her dress. Listen, daily life has to happen.
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah.
Josie: Minx is actually— has weirdly good posture while writing the letters and is wearing reading glasses frames that she does not need. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Oh, I love it. So yeah, Blaire comes bustling in with all of her papers and notebooks.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, hello dear. Productive day?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, extremely. You?
Josie (as Minx): Well, I’m eventually getting these letters done. Did you find anything important?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes. Yes, I did.
Josie: Minx gently sets down her quill and seals up the inkwell. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Have you ever heard of the Archive of Echoes?
Josie (as Minx): Can’t say I have.
Kim (as Blaire): They are just a font of hidden information. Like, ancient, ancient spirits and relics and things that are not from this world. And I think it’s what we need. Well, it’s what I need. What I need. For, uh—
Josie: I see. For… a witch of your many endeavors?
Kim (as Blaire): For the, you know, bringing ghosts out of drugs thing?
Josie (as Minx): Ah. I see.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. It’s— if one of them has what I’m looking for, then I could really make some progress on this.
Josie (as Minx): I’m not going to object to infiltrating such a place. Frankly it has been a long time coming that we break into a library. However, I do think things that deal with our imminent hulls and vampires and Circle of Flame problems make a bit of priority as far as scores go?
Kim (as Blaire): Well, that’s what I was thinking. It’s kind of a two birds, one stone kind of situation. I could get what I’m looking for, but also these things could have a lot of valuable information on hulls and vampires, which are problems for us right now.
Josie (as Minx): I suppose so. It seems like an occult source of information?
Kim (as Blaire): Yes.
Josie (as Minx): Well, do you perhaps have more information on the joint that we can plan around?
Rhi: So, I can step in here and monologue while Blaire explains this to the two of you. By the— what is Myra’s reaction to, uh, to this? As Blaire is explaining this?
Minna: I think she’s just, like, listening with curiosity. Because she is also doing occult research right now.
Rhi: Yeah. So, what Blaire knows, kind of just from her reading, basically kind of the— she can explain how this Archive of Echoes thing works, who’s in charge of it. These notes also would have indicated that the actual building of the Archive of Echoes is one of the most secure locations in the city. It’s in Whitecrown, to start with. It has really intensive spark-craft security, some of the best spirit wards in the city, a fairly small number of people on site in terms of guards, but the guards that are there are, like, very highly specially trained to deal with, you know, if an 80-year ghost escapes.
Kim: And also, people like me.
Rhi: And also people like Blaire.
Josie: Minx kind of blanches a bit when Blaire explains, you know, the whole captive ghost dispensing the information thing.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, like centuries-old ghosts.
Josie: Minx is a little more than a bit put off. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, basically that is what Blaire can explain about the archive. For further information, you will need to Gather it, but that’s what Blaire is able to explain.
Josie (as Minx): To be frank, given the size of the organization and the level of security, I think this might be something we need help with?
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, whatever it takes, I’m willing to do it. Because I— we need this badly.
Josie (as Minx): We absolutely do. So, I’m seeing some very bad results if we fail here. I don’t see us simply being able to back off the score.
Kim (as Blaire): We’re not going to fail.
Minna (as Myra): Are you sure about this? Because this is a lot for even us to bite off.
Kim (as Blaire): I know, but… listen, I just, I feel it. We can’t afford to lose this and I don’t think we will.
Josie (as Minx): Which is why I’m saying we should at least recruit some manner of assistance. Not necessarily for the actual infiltration…
Kim (as Blaire): Well, who did you have in mind?
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps… what are they called? The Reconciled?
Kim (as Blaire): They wouldn’t even help me try to research this so, no, I don’t think that they’re down for it.
Josie (as Minx): That’s unfortunate. I wonder if The Gondoliers would be interested.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, Kay’s down for anything, but…
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): That’s true, but I mean organizationally. I bet there’s a lot of things in there that they would have rather pull up from the bottom of a canal, rather than handing to the Spirit Wardens.
Rhi: Yeah, The Gondoliers is actually a really good tack, because they definitely have occult ties. I will also say, just sort of on a game mechanics level, you all are Tier III. They archive of Echoes is gonna be a Tier IV.
Josie: I see.
Rhi: Yeah. So, I would recommend, kind of in addition to your Gathering Info, you can spend rep to acquire assets for things that are, like, better equipment than you normally have, or other stuff. Like, kind of as you start to formulate a plan I will let you do that downtime action out of downtime.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: Cause there’s not really a time frame on this score, so you can take a little more time to get some stuff together and do it right.
Kim: Right.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, just wanted to put that out there as a thing you can do in addition to Gathering Info.
Josie: Right. I think Minx’s tack is gonna be try to find out what other organizations in the city know about this.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: About the library of echoes. Primarily from The Gondoliers to like, try and secure their aid.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Josie: But also, like, Minx’s cult friends and stuff like that.
Rhi: Yeah. Myra, Blaire, you have thoughts for info gathering or asset acquiring?
Kim: I was thinking I would probably have Blaire go and consult with Aranna the Blessed and her cult to see if she’s in, or she knows people who are in.
Rhi: Yeah. For sure.
Josie: Yeah, cause to be frank, we can probably just be like, “Listen, if y’all help us out, we can pull what you need out of there.”
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. “We can pick up some shit while were in there, we’ll put together a shopping list.”
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Like, let’s just bust the place open and let the vultures descend, as it were.
Kim: Yeah, exactly.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so let’s start with Minx, then. And I will let you just do kind of one overall roll for sort of your chatting around. It’ll be a montage of Minx chatting with a bunch of different people to see what you can turn up.
Josie: 6.
Rhi: Wonderful. So, I think what you find in talking with both The Gondoliers and your cult friends is that the chief scholar, Lord Penderyn, in what is not really a surprising twist, has been taking advantage of his position as the chief scholar of the Archive of Echoes to make money.
Kim: [gasps] No…
Rhi: Would you believe it?
Kim: How dare he?
Josie: Uh huh.
Kim: Unbelievable.
Rhi: I know. He has basically started a secret society known as the Path of Echoes, which more or less, he will— so, the way the Archive is supposed to work is that the chief scholar is only supposed to consult with these spirits by order of the Lord Governor of Duskwall, the commander of the Imperial Garrison of Duskwall, or the Immortal Emperor. Lord Penderyn found this to be a rather limited view of his opportunities, and basically, for the right price he will… there’s sort of a tiered pricing system where, you know, for a certain amount you can relay questions to him and he will consult the spirits and bring that information back.
Kim: Subscribe to my spooky Patreon.
Rhi: Basically.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Like, that he kind of makes generally available to the nobility. The actual, sort of, membership of this secret society, The Path of Echoes, those are people that he will kind of slip in to the Archive so that they can commune with these spirits directly. So, I think that’s kind of what you’re able to find out initially on a 6, if you’ve got follow-up questions.
Josie: Yeah. Who am I getting this information from?
Rhi: Well, so you get a little bit of this from The Gondoliers, they know about the Path of Echoes, but they don’t know the details of membership. They know it exists and they do not care for it, for basically the reasons that you outlined. In that they find what the Path of Echoes and the Archive of Echoes really is doing is to be kind of— it’s just against the natural order… well, not really the natural order of things, but it’s just, it feels wrong. They don’t like it. This is not how spirits are supposed to be treated.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. It just, they’re not fans. So, they don’t like that the spirits are being used in this way.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: The cultists, as I recall, were some— there were a number of like, high society folks in that. Because it was sort of an art cult. [laughs]
Josie: Mm hmm. [laughs]
Rhi: So there were some, you know, young rebellious nobles where this is how they act out against their parents, is they join a cult. And some of them, I think, have parents who have paid the, like, the lower fee of getting information relayed through Lord Penderyn.
Josie: Right. And what do these fees look like?
Rhi: Oh, what a good question. Let me flip to the page where it tells me coin. 8 coin for Penderyn to consult.
Josie: Jeez. And getting actually ushered is… a lot.
Rhi: A lot more, but it’s also a time thing. It’s not like you can pay this money and the next night you can go in. You have to prove yourself worthy of entrance. And that’s a process that, like, one of them will tell you, like:
Rhi (as cultist): Yeah, my parents were trying to get into this and it was like months of them doing all of these favors for Penderyn and they just got sick of it, because nothing was ever gonna come of it and they were pretty sure it was a scam. I’m not even sure this Path of Echoes even exists.
Rhi: From the other information you’ve gotten from The Gondoliers you’re pretty sure it does exist. [laughs] But it’s— it is a process before he will let you into the archive. So, yeah, it’s not like you could just round up a huge sack of money and be like, “Alright, here’s my ticket!”
Josie: [laughs] Okay.
Rhi: “One ticket for ghost ride, please.”
Josie: Who else would be interested?
Rhi: What do you mean?
Josie: In, you know, kinda fuckin’ over the library of echoes and getting some stuff out of there?
Rhi: Ooh, interesting. So, The Gondoliers just sort of broadly approve of you doing anything to kind of mess that situation up. They don’t necessarily want you to bring them anything because that’s all a little too rich for their blood at this point, quite frankly. It’s just like, they don’t approve of it, but they also don’t want to be responsible for that level of powerful stuff.
Josie: Right.
Kim: Puts a huge target on their backs.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. And also, just like, you know, an 800-year-old ghost, they don’t wanna try and deal with that.
Kim: An 800-year-old friend, however…
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh… oh Blaire. The cult members. I think the one, the young woman whose parents had been trying to get in, she basically says, like, she will pay you 4 coin if you can bring her something. Like, not something. If you can bring her one of the ghosts from the archive, she’ll pay you 4 coin. She mostly wants it to give to her— like, so that she and her parents can use it as leverage to get Penderyn to let them in. [laughs] Basically, “We have your ghost! Let us into your club!” [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: “Let me iiiin!”
Josie: Yeah, we can do that, I think.
Rhi: Yeah. Basically just, “Bring me a ghost in a jar and I’ll pay you money for it.” Yeah, The Gondoliers are like, “Good on ya, we support you, we will give you a lift close to the area, but please don’t bring us any souvenirs.” [laughs]
Josie: Okay. [laughs]
Rhi: That’s what Minx is able to get, I think,
Josie: Cool.
Rhi: Blaire.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: You were talking to Aranna the Blessed.
Kim: Yes, I wanted to roll Consort to see if we could get the band back together.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. So, specifically what are you looking for with her?
Kim: I’m looking to see if either she and/or other people, occult people that she knows, or a group of people, would be interested in joining us on this extremely— what’s the word I’m looking for…
Rhi: Extremely risky…
Kim: Yeah, this extremely bold and daring endeavor.
Rhi: Okay, So, this is actually going to be not Gather Information but you are acquiring an asset.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: I’m gonna treat this as you are trying to acquire a gang. So, for that we are going to have you roll not one of your particular skills, but you are gonna roll the crew’s tier. So, you will roll 3d6.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: And tell me what your result is and we’ll go from there.
Kim: I rolled a 6, 6 and 1. So, what does a crit look like on this?
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Ooh!
Rhi: Tier plus… this is the fuckin’ thing that got you Nicholas. Tier plus 2, that gets you a Tier V—
Kim: Wait, who’s Nicholas? Oh! [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Firebird. Yes.
Rhi: When Minx went out to acquire a real estate attorney and critted on that roll. The— we almost never use this goddam mechanic, and then we do and you all are like, “Oh, critical.”
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: So I get a Tier V gang with me on this?
Rhi: Yeah. This is quite significant, because you’re going up against a Tier V challenge. So, they are going to be massively helpful. That’s actually fantastic.
Kim: Fuck yes. Yes!
Rhi: I think that— so like, Aranna is not the head of this cult. She’s like middle management, basically. She’s a mid-tier priestess. I think that you kinda bring this idea to her of like, “Hey, we’re doing this thing,” she gets this very intriguing spark in her eyes and says to give her a couple days and then she comes back to you. The leader of her cult, um, whose name I will have to make up at some point, is a former member of the Path of Echoes. I think she got kicked out due to ideological difference with Lord Penderyn. And you’ve just offered her an opportunity to get back in and get back at him.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Spite. A powerful motivator.
Kim: Oh yeah.
Rhi: So, basically she is going to bring the entire— like, not the entire cult, but most of the cult of— did we determine who Aranna follows?
Kim: I… if we did, I don’t remember rit.
Rhi: I am in the same boat. So yeah, she is basically gonna bring the majority of this cult to back you up on this score. And I will get into the details of what a gang can do for you, how you can use a gang, kind of when we get into prep for this score. I’ll talk about that, for what you can do. But, yeah. Great job. A plus. You just massively changed the balance of this score for yourselves in a great way.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Well done.
Kim: Hooray.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: I will do anything to appease Setarra.
Rhi: [laughs] Oh, honey.
Josie: Baby. No. [laughs]
Kim: Blaire’s in a very desperate place right now.
Rhi: Blaire, she is. She is.
Kim: She’s not doing great. Inside.
Rhi: So, Blaire has gotten that arrangement. Myra.
Minna: Hello.
Rhi: Hello. What would you like to do for Info Gathering, asset acquiring, you can do one of those, you can do both of those, whatever you would like.
Minna: Do we know of anything that could help us get through the spark-craft security that I could acquire?
Rhi: Um… that is a good question. Lemme see. I mean, spark-craft runs on electroplasm. But it is still electricity. So, I am intrigued by the concept of, like, what does an electroplasm EMP look like?
Minna: [delighted laugh]
Kim: [gasps] Ooh! [claps]
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Please.
Rhi: This is where I’m at—
Kim: How have we never come across this before? How has this never happened?
Josie: It probably goes against Blaire’s ethics.
Rhi: Yeah. It depends on how this turns out, because if it is something that affects electroplasm, it could mess with ghosts.
Minna: I love this.
Rhi: But this would again be an acquire asset roll, if you wanted to do that.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: And so, you’ll roll 3d6 and tell me the highest.
Minna: Really? It’s a 4.
Rhi: 4, okay. So, that gets you a Tier III quality thing. Gosh, who would you— okay. So, I feel like the chain of events here is you talk to Seeks and Seeks doesn’t have one of these things, but Seeks knows somebody. She has a connection to a tinkerer, and she’s able to acquire a gadget. And so, I think— let me… hang on. We might run through something here, real quick.
Yeah, so what I’m actually gonna do here, I think, is we’re going to rapid-fire run through the questions if you were, yourself, inventing this as a character, there’s a series of questions where we kind of go back and forth to determine what this thing is.
Minna: Interacting with a set of rules we’ve never used before.
Rhi: Yeah, none of you have ever done crafting. Alright, so the first question we’ve already answered. “What type of creation is it and what does it do?” It is a spark-craft creation that operates like an EMP. It will knock out spark-craft and electroplasmic powered things in an area. “A crushing blow, staggering wind, searing fire, electrical surge.” That’s the power level that we’re dealing with here. This is— you are working with something that is comparable to a hand grenade.
Minna: Electrical surge is kinda what I was thinking.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay.
Minna: Like, maybe if we can attach it to something, it can cause like a surge and short everything out.
Rhi: Okay. “What rare, strange or adverse aspect of this design has kept it in obscurity?” This goes back to the question that was asked earlier. Why haven’t we used this before? What is weird about this? This is something you wouldn’t reach for except for a score that is this…
Minna: Maybe because it does cause, like, an electroplasm surge, it has the tendency to draw things that feed off it and then doesn’t give them anything to eat.
Rhi: Oh!
Minna: Because it takes all that electroplasm away.
Rhi: Ooh…
Josie: [nervous laugh]
Rhi: That’s great. That actually almost covers the next question, which is, “What drawbacks does this item have?” which is the one that I answer. So, I think that it’s volatile. “This item produces a dangerous or troublesome side effect.”
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: It draws in a crowd of ghosts. As soon as you use this, I’m gonna start a clock for Ghost Horde.
Minna: [delighted giggle]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Yay. Party.
Rhi: And I’m also going to say that it’s consumable. It’s a one-use item.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Those are the limitations on it. That’s great. Is there any other prep stuff that you all would like to do? I feel like you are actually in a really excellent place.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: But if you all have other ideas for stuff you’d like to do…
Josie: Can I acquire an asset?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Is there anything like tools for disabling spark-craft alarms, but for like, arcane shit?
Rhi: I think in this case what you would be doing is getting improved arcane implements. A high tier. Because like, Blaire has basically Tier III arcane implements. That’s what you have access to as a crew. You could acquire an asset to try to get higher tier implements.
Josie: Yeah. Yeah, I think I wanna do that.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Try and get Blaire some higher tier stuff.
Rhi: Which, like, I think that what it is, is like, the idea is that the arcane implements is that’s… you keep having that your set tier because that’s what you can afford for your level. This is something where like, you cannot afford to always buy Blaire this high quality of stuff, but for this score you can do it. So it’ll be a one-use thing for this score.
Josie: Okey dokey.
Rhi: Yeah, so go ahead and again roll 3d6.
Josie: Okay. Well, using an online die roller I got a critical.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay. Yeah.
Josie: So… [laughs]
Rhi: Blaire will have Tier V, I’ll take it.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: How do you always get fuckin’ criticals on acquire asset rolls? This is ridiculous! Okay, so—
Josie: I dunno!
Kim: I think we just need to roll more acquire assets.
Rhi: Clearly! [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: I think I’m gonna start with how you all can use this cohort, because I think that might influence the plan that you end up with.
Josie: Okey dokey.
Rhi: Your cohort. They are a group of Tier V adepts of the cult of The Radiant Word, is the cult that I settled on. If we said that Aranna the Blessed was attached to a different forgotten god earlier… oops.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: Fuck it! Just fuck it. Maybe it’s like a monster of the week kinda thing.
Rhi: You know, who knows?
Kim: Who’s to say?
Rhi: So, in terms of kind of— you’re gonna get, I’m gonna say somewhere between 20 and 25 cultists of varying kind of skills. You know, some are gonna be Whispers, some are gonna be Leeches, you’re gonna have people that can kinda do various things.
The way that you use a gang. You have used— so, when you had Lani and Roxanne researching the Circle of Flame, we did sort of use these mechanics, but that was kind of a long-term background thing that they had running. This is the first time you’ve used this in a score. So, basically what you will do is you can send a gang, you can send this gang to achieve a goal. And then I will roll their quality, which is 5 dice. [laughs]
Josie: Jesus.
Rhi: And that will give the result of whatever you end them off to do. Alternatively, one of you can, if you want to lead them in doing something, you can accompany them and lead a group action. And so, you’ll roll, you know, if you’re telling them to Attune with however many dice, they would roll 5 dice of Attune and then, you know, we take the result. So, with that in mind, how do you want to— what do you wanna do in terms of a type of plan for this score?
Josie: It’s either stealth or occult.
Kim: Mm… I didn’t even consider occult. I was going to suggest stealth.
Rhi: I guess you— so, I think if you had the cult providing your method of entry, then you could say that it’s an occult plan and we would just have to kinda figure out how they’re getting you in.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: But then that would kind of— I think whatever they’d do would sort of, that’s gonna lock them down for the score.
Josie: Mm hmm. I kinda wanna, like, tell them to guarantee an exit point.
Rhi: Okay. They will keep— they will prevent anybody from getting in and bothering you, or they’ll do their best. And in addition to that, they’ll just keep all of the, like, the spirit wards on this place just like, locked down.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: So, they won’t be active while you all are rummaging around inside. Or at least, kind of the exterior ones that they would have access to. Once you kinda get deeper into the archive, you will have to—
Josie: Because once we have what we need, we just wanna bolt.
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, I like that plan. I think that they can definitely— they’re your perimeter guard. [laughs] They’re gonna help you get in, they’re gonna keep things locked down while you’re working inside, and they’re gonna make sure you can get out.
Josie: Right. Cause you said it was like, heavily warded and alarmed, but lightly guarded in terms of personnel?
Rhi: Yes. Not a lot of— yeah
Josie: So, I feel like we have time, but once our time is up it’ll be really bad. So… [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, not a lot of people inside, but the people who are there are gonna be very, like they’re gonna be Tier V individuals.
Josie: Oh jeez.
Rhi: Yeah. Very highly trained, you know, specialists who will be able to kick your asses. So, you’re heading into Whitecrown, which is the seat of government. It’s the wealthiest district in the city. This is where, like, the Imperial Military Garrison is, this is where the Lord Governor’s mansion is, this is where the Duskwall City Council meets. Like, this is the seat of power. This is not a place where you have ever done a score. You’ve been in basically every other district of this city. Myra comes here sometimes for the Academy, for Duskwall Academy, but you’ve never tried to break in here.
Josie: Oh jeez.
Rhi: So, Engagement Roll. One for luck. “Is this operation particularly bold or daring?”
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: [laughs] Yes. Jesus Christ, is it ever. “Does the plan’s detail expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they’re weakest?” No. “Is the target strongest against this approach, or do they have particular defenses or special preparations?” Yes. Minus 1. “Are your friends or contacts providing aid or insight for this operation?” Yes, to the degree that I’m giving you two dice for this, because of that Tier V gang.
Josie: Oh wow.
Rhi: However… [laughs] because you are in Whitecrown, I am removing 2d6.
Kim: Oh.
Josie: Cool.
Rhi: So, this is gonna be a 1d6 engagement Roll.
Josie: Oh, God. [laughs] Oh no…
Kim: [groans]
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Devil’s Bargain? Can we push ourselves?
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: No!
Kim: Anything? Anything?
Rhi: [laughs] No, that’s not how this works.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Are there— I mean, you are welcome to try to make arguments for things that you have done to push this up, to prep here. But I’ve accounted for your Tier 5 gang. You’re operating in— there’s a reason you all never hit Whitecrown before.
Josie: Uh huh.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: Uh…
Kim: Just don’t fuck it up, Rhi, please don’t.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: [softly laughs]
Josie: She fucked it up. She so fucked it up.
Kim: No… Rhi, just tell us. Don’t kill us.
Rhi: Got a 1.
Josie: I knew it.
Minna: Rhi…
Rhi: I’m sorry! [laughs] I didn’t do it on purpose!
Kim: We’re going in a little fucked.
Rhi: Just a smidgeon, yes. I cannot argue with that. You are slightly fucked from jump. So, time to set the scene. So, Whitecrown is, as I have said, basically the seat of government in Duskwall. The Lord Governor’s stronghold is here, City Council meets here, Duskwall Academy is here. There’s a big lighthouse that sits out at the end of the island that is Whitecrown. And kind of among all of this, The Archive of Echoes stands out for being almost unnoticeable.
It’s a, relative to its surroundings, it’s a fairly plain building. I think it’s done in what we would consider sort of like a Grecian style. It’s got the, you know, big marble columns and the sort of narrow triangle pediment at the top. There’s some, uh, fairly bland, like, historical engravings of, like, the founding of Duskwall, things like that, that you would find on kind of any generic government building. There’s not really anything that identifies what this building is. It looks like just another government office among a whole bunch of other government offices.
And I think that we see, you know, the streets here are very well lit. As, you know, there’s people kind of walking through the streets, very finely dressed. Carriages rolling past. Bluecoats on patrol. But we can see, sort of moving in the shadows, cloaks up, slinking around, are small groups of people moving in twos and threes. All slinking into position around this unassuming building. And I think we see a group of four with hoods up, but in such a way that we can see that three of them are The Magpies and the fourth person is a short, heavy-set woman in her mid-50s. Dark skin, thick silver hair that’s done in these, like, really ornate braids that are kind of piled up under her hood. She’s got face tattoos kind of imitating the sort of sigils you would see on a spirit mask. It’s like she has a spirit mask tattooed on her face.
Minna: Well, that’s neat.
Rhi: And this is the leader of Aranna’s cult, which follows The Radiant Word, a forgotten god, and she is known as Vidrana The Radiant. Used to be a member of the Path of Echoes, isn’t anymore. Was just handed an opportunity for some light vengeance.
Josie: Yay. You know, just light-hearted vengeance.
Rhi: Yeah. Just a light sprinkling of revenge.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: She looks up at the building and kinda shakes her head a little bit and is like:
Rhi (as Vidrana): Penderyn’s squandering what he has here. Alright, we will begin our work to bring down the wards, but it’ll be up to all of you to get past the rest. Best of luck, and we’ll hold things out here.
Josie (as Minx): Good luck to you as well.
Rhi: I think she makes some kind of sign in front of the three of you that you’re guessing is a blessing of some sort, and then she kind of slinks off into the shadows to join her cultists. Blaire, I think that you can see as you’re looking through your spirit mask into the ghost field, it’s hard to look at this building. [laughs]
Kim: Is it, like, very bright?
Rhi: It’s very bright, just from all the wards that are up.
Kim: Oh…
Rhi: And what you can kind of tell is that, like, the wards are almost a distraction that keep you from seeing what’s actually inside the building. Like, that’s part of their function. So, you see these wards and I think that, like, as you’re looking, you start to see, like, some sigils sort of flare in the ghost field. There’s some shifting of light and then the whole thing just sort of, like, [sound effect] powers down.
Kim: Nice.
Rhi: It doesn’t, like, snap off abruptly. The wards just kind of turn off. They fade out very gently. And now you can see what’s actually in here and it’s still pretty hard to look at, because there’s just… it’s like a candy store in there. [laughs]
Kim: Right.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: There’s so much, just, occult stuff. Very powerful stuff. I think that you are able to approach. I think that there is a, like, side door, like a service door, in an alley. And I think that you approach that. Myra, are you the one using the EMP?
Minna: I am.
Rhi: Okay. So you, I think, following the directions that you were given, you find kind of the, you know, some sort of power junction. Affix it, fiddle with some dials, attach some wires to some things, push a button and then run back, wait. And all three of you kinda waiting. And then there’s this bang!
Josie: Oh jeez.
Rhi: As the power junction blows up. Very loudly.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: And all three of you can feel, like, it feels kind of like a static electric shock just sort of like washes over your bodies really quickly. Like, all your hair stands on end for a second. And then it’s gone.
Josie (as Minx): No, my bun!
Rhi: [laughs] And so, a couple things are gonna happen as a result of that. Three things. One, the spark-craft security has been impeded, but not fully taken down. Because this was a Tier III device going up against a Tier V security system. So, it’s been interfered with, but some pieces of it might still be online. So, that’s one. Two, I’m starting a clock. Which is Ghost Horde Arrives.
Minna: Yes.
Josie: Yay!
Rhi: And that is gonna be at 1 out of 4.
Kim: Yay, friends.
Josie: Or as Blaire likes to call it, a Cuddle Pile.
Rhi: [laughs] And number three. The three of you return to the door, open it up, slide inside. Okay, we’re in. You look down the hall and see running towards you, guns in hand, are a pair of guards.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Josie: Great!
Rhi: Yep. So, that is you are starting in a desperate position. The guards have already been notified that something is going on and have seen you just slip in this side door. So, you’ve got two of them coming towards you now. You’re not sure how many more are on their way. But yeah. You’re in a desperate position for whoever wants to start acting.

##Blooper [00.53.37]
Rhi: No, there’s a specific name for a group of, um…
Kim: Minions?
Rhi: Whispers, basically. Hang on.
Kim: A group of Whispers?
Rhi: I gotta find this now, hang on.
Kim: A murder of Whispers?
Josie: [whispers] A murder.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] We had the same thought.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: I mean, I like it. I’m into it. Let me find… a gang. Okay, so they would be a… if you all were a crew type that could have gangs normally, this would be a crew of adepts. A-D-E-P-T-S.
Kim: A group of Whispers is called an adepts?
Rhi: Well, it’s a group of scholars, tinkerers, occultists and chemists. So, basically you’re getting a bunch of Whispers and Leeches. More or less.
Kim: Can we still call them a murder of Whispers? That’s way cooler.
Rhi: Yes we can. It is.
Minna: [giggles]
Josie: [laughs]"
"Season 3, Episode 20: The Ghostly Secrets Score, Part 2 Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly (@Michellicopter)
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. As always, thank you so much for joining us. In very exciting news, we just posted a big batch of transcripts to the site. The first two episodes of Season 3 are transcribed, as are three of our four bonus episodes. Huge thanks to all our supporters on Patreon for making these transcripts possible.
I haven’t talked about it much this year, but International Podcast Month is gearing up for its third year. This September, you’ll be able to hear podcasters in actual plays, audio dramas, non-fiction episodes and more. I GMed an extremely fun and silly game of Mission Accomplished, and I played in a Forged in the Dark game called Songs for the Dusk. They’re both awesome episodes and I can’t wait for you to hear them.
Next, I’d like to tell you about this month’s featured charity.
The Okra Project is, to quote their website, “a collective that seeks to address the global crises faced by black trans people by bringing home-cooked, healthy and culturally-specific meals and resources to black trans people”. The project provides food and meals in a variety of ways and has expanded to offer cooking classes, an international grocery fund, and self-care opportunities. Visit TheOkraProject.com or check the link in the show notes to donate.
I also recommend looking for local organizations in your communities to support. Search for your local Black Lives Matter group, bail funds, food banks, rent assistance, queer support groups and more. Voting is important. Contacting elected officials is important. But getting involved in your community to support, protect and uplift each other is also absolutely critical.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story continues [00.01.58]
Rhi: So, that is you are starting in a desperate position. The guards have already been notified that something is going on and have seen you just slip in this side door. So, you’ve got two of them coming towards you now. You’re not sure how many more are on their way, but yeah. You’re in a desperate position, for whoever wants to start acting.
Josie: I think I’m gonna go for a distraction route. I don’t have any— I’m not bearing— I’m not holding any weapons in my hand. I, like, I have my cane-sword.
Rhi: Right.
Josie: Which… Minx is gonna do her best to not look perturbed and just kind of carry that just like in her armpit, like at her side, raise her hands up and be like:
Josie (as Minx): [sighs] Fine, fine. We just wanted to talk anyway.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. Desperate.
Josie: Uh huh?
Rhi: Reduced effect.
Josie: Can I… push my Sway up to normal effect?
Rhi: Yeah, if you wanna take the two stress for it.
Josie: I do.
Rhi: Yeah, then yeah. You can have standard effect by taking two stress.
Josie: Uh huh. Does anyone wanna… help me out with the Sway, or…
Kim: Yeah, I can help with this.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Although part of the idea is to get them focused on me so y’all can do something. Um…
Rhi: I mean, I think you can… I think Blaire can assist in a way that maybe she shrinks back behind you a little bit, or I think she can help in a way that still meets that goal. So Blaire, take a point of stress.
Kim: Yes ma’am.
Rhi: And what are you rolling? Does that make it a 5? 5d6.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: Alright.
Josie: 5d6. Wahey, got a 6.
Rhi: You sure did.
Kim: Oof, that was close, though.
Josie: Yeah, there were two 1s in there, jeez.
Kim: And a 3.
Rhi: [laughs] Just by the skin of your teeth. So, you do it. And you said, “Fine, fine. We just wanted to talk.” Right?
Josie: Uh huh.
Rhi: Okay. So, the good news is they don’t immediately start shooting you. [laughs]
Josie: Right.
Rhi: But they stop about fifteen feet away, guns up and aimed, and will say:
Rhi (as Guard): Drop your weapons. Hands on your head. Down on your knees.
Josie (as Minx): [sighs] Very well.
Josie: I think Minx is going to comply with that, hoping at least one of their guns follow her down and, you know, the people hiding behind me can do something over my head.
Rhi: Yes. I will also remind you, just so that you are aware. As a group, you have three smoke bombs.
Josie: That’s true.
Rhi: [laughs] I just, I wanted to double check and see what you all had on your character sheet. You have three smoke bombs that you can choose to have in your inventory. Minx does as she’s told. What do the two of you do? Blaire? Myra?
Kim: Um, Blaire also complies with this.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Myra throws a smoke bomb.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay. This is still gonna be desperate. Reduced effect.
Minna: I’m gonna do Skirmish. Also gonna push myself for normal effect.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: I think that you throw the smoke bomb and it goes “psssh” and fills the hallway with smoke.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: But before the hallway is fully filled with smoke, the other guard shoots you.
Minna: Ah.
Rhi: Right in the chest, Level 3 harm.
Kim: Uh…
Minna: Can I resist that?
Rhi: Yeah, you can resist it. Also, do not forget that armor is a thing. We always forget armor is a thing. So, I’m just gonna remind you.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Armor is a thing. But yeah, you’ll resist it with Prowess.
Minna: Yeah, that’s a 6.
Rhi: Okay. Of course. Why would it be anything else? [laughs] It’s Myra rolling resistance.
Minna: So it’s a level 2 harm?
Rhi: Yeah, that’ll drop it to level 2. I think that you’re able to sort of twist, and instead of it just hitting you square in the chest, you turn and it kind of like grazes across your shoulders and collar bones. So like, you’re bleeding pretty bad, you’re in a not insignificant amount of pain, but it didn’t— you didn’t take a bullet into the chest. So, you’ve got that going for you.
Josie: I think as soon as the shot goes off— Minx was getting down into, like, a kneeling position, right?
Rhi: Right.
Josie: I think she’s gonna do, like, a roll forward and come out at the end of the roll having pulled a pistol out. And just start firing.
Rhi: Okay. You are gonna be firing into smoke, so that is going to, I mean, that’s basically gonna drop you to zero effect.
Josie: Well I’m— more the idea is suppressive fire, right?
Rhi: Okay, I see. You’re not trying to actually hit them, you’re just trying to…
Josie: Yeah. You can’t stay here, otherwise you’ll get shot eventually. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. I will make that reduced effect then, but it’s still gonna be a desperate position.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: So. Don’t forget Devil’s Bargains are available.
Josie: Uh, yeah, what does a Devil’s Bargain look like on this one?
Rhi: So, you just, you’re marking for your inventory a pistol?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: You can do suppressing fire right now, but your pistol’s gonna jam. I know you have the option of a second pistol as an inventory item, but one of your pistols is going to be unusable for the rest of the score.
Josie: Yeah, you know what? I’m gonna take that.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: And I got a 5.
Rhi: Reduced effect, desperate, you got a 5… you do it, but there’s a consequence. Okay. So, I think that what happens is you start shooting back, like firing wildly, and— so, the other, like, the guards, you can hear them, you know:
Rhi (as Guard): Fall back, get around the corner!
Rhi: And so, they have backed off, but one of them activates an alarm. Because you didn’t take down the whole security system. So, we’re gonna start another clock.
Kim: Jesus.
Rhi: Security Backup Arrives. 1 out of 3.
Kim: We were doing so well.
Rhi: You were. So, they have fallen back somewhat, it sounded like they ducked around a corner. But if you come out around the end of the hall, like, they’re gonna see you and backup is on its way. So, you’ll need to find some way to deal with these two and then skedaddle before their friends get here.
Kim: Are any of them in stabbing range?
Rhi: No, but you could get to it.
Kim: I want Blaire to do a stab.
Rhi: I mean, Blaire can try and do a stab. I support Blaire.
Kim: Thank you. Because that’s what I wanna do.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it.
Kim: Do I have to roll something to just get within range first, or—
Rhi: No, no, you can just run down the hallway and then pop around the corner and stab ‘em. If you have a particular idea for how this stabbing occurs, let me know.
Kim: No, I don’t.
Josie: And also not getting shot by the other one.
Rhi: Yes. Because again, so this is gonna be desperate, reduced effect.
Kim: Ah, shit. What do I have to roll to do a stab? Is it Skirmish?
Rhi: Yeah. Usually, it’s Skirmish.
Kim: Okay. Oh, um—
Rhi: Or, I mean, if you wanna make an ambush argument, that you’re jumping out of the smoke and stabbing one of them, you could do Prowl.
Kim: I mean, I have the same for both abilities, so it doesn’t matter.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. You push yourself if you want it to be— you push yourself, so you take two stress.
Kim: Alright, I’ll take two stress to whatever effect, whatever’s above—
Rhi: Standard.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: It’ll be standard effect. Okay.
Josie: I could argue that I squeeze off my last couple bullets and my gun gets jammed and that’s my assistance, I guess?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah.
Kim: Are you sure?
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Okay, thank you, dear. Alright, I’ll be rolling 2d6 for this then.
Rhi: Yep. And Josie, mark a point of stress.
Kim: Oof. Okay, thank you Josie. I got a 6 and a 4.
Rhi: Nice.
Josie: Woo!
Rhi: Yeah, what does this look like as— I think, like, the two of them have done that thing where they, like, split around— like, they ducked around a corner and have their backs to the wall and like, have their pistols up, and then Blaire just— what does it look like when Blaire comes around and stabs one of them in the kidneys?
Kim: Oh, kidneys? I was imagining, like, stabbed in the leg or the knee, to like immobilize him?
Rhi: Ooh, that’s even better. Go with that.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: I imagine Blaire just— I know I didn’t roll Prowl, but like, sneaks up behind of them and just goes for, like, the side of the knee.
Rhi: Oh, yeah.
Kim: And just like, immediately topples this guy.
Rhi: Yeah. He shrieks in pain and falls down, clutching his leg. There’s a lot of blood. And I think you manage to duck back into the smoke as the guard who didn’t get stabbed, like, fires a wild shot after you. But it does not connect.
Kim: This guy’s still armed, though. Is it possible for me to, like, grab his weapon while he’s down?
Rhi: You would have to have gotten a critical on that.
Kim: Oh, okay, that’s fair. Okay.
Rhi: Um, but hey, like, yeah, you knocked him down. He’s not gonna be able to run after you.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Myra.
Minna: [sighs] How many of them are still up?
Rhi: Uh, one is standing and has a gun, one is down on the ground, screaming— I mean, well, he’s stopped screaming in pain, but he’s bleeding heavily and also has a gun.
Josie: They are on the other side of the smoke cloud.
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, you kinda have to duck through the smoke cloud, do a thing.
Minna: I have a vial of slumber essence.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Josie: But how are you gonna use it without just getting shot in the back?
Minna: That’s true, yeah, I dunno about that. I’m trying to find a way where I don’t have to engage.
Rhi: Yeah. And the way we’ve always done slumber essence is that it is applied to the face.
Minna: I have to physically engage, yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, you gotta…
Minna: I gotta put it…
Rhi: “Does this smell like chloroform to you?”
Minna: Yeah, that’s usually how I do it. Um… hmm…
Rhi: I mean, you could shoot. You could kind of pop out of the smoke cloud and smoke.
Minna: Yeah. I might actually do that.
Rhi: You could use your fine whisky bottle and make it into a Molotov cocktail.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: You could… I’m just looking at what you have in your—
Minna: That’s really true! [laughs]
Rhi: What you have in your inventory here. I mean, yeah. Yeah.
Minna: What is with my affinity with fire? Question.
Rhi: I don’t know. There’s— Myra, deep down inside, has, you know….
Minna: Just wants to set things on fire. [laughs]
Rhi: She does. Like, listen, she was very emotionally repressed for most of her life, and occasionally, those emotions come out in the form of “I wish it to burn.”
Minna: [sings] I just wanna set the world on fire… [laughs]
Rhi: So, you’re gonna use a fine bottle of whisky, “potent in both its alcohol and its ability to impress” so, uh, yeah, I’m gonna give you standard effect on this since it’s a fine bottle.
Minna: Skirmish?
Rhi: Yeah. You could do Skirmish, you could do Wreck. I think either of those would be appropriate.
Minna: I think it’s minus one die, so I’m gonna do Skirmish, because I’m better at that. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. What’s— why’s it minus one?
Minna: Because I have level 2 harm.
Rhi: Yeah, you did get shot, didn’t ya? Yeah.
Minna: Yeah, I actually remembered it for once.
Rhi: Yeah! I didn’t. Thank you. So yeah, go ahead and roll that. This is going to continue to be desperate, so mark the appropriate XP. But it is, you’re starting at standard effect.
Minna: What would a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Um… I’m gonna tick up the ghost clock by one.
Minna: Are we okay with that?
Josie: Sure.
Minna: Alright, let’s do that. Just cause I don’t wanna die here.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: That’s a 6.
Rhi: Please describe Myra pulling out this bottle of whisky and turning it into a Molotov. How does she do this?
Minna: Well, she happens to have a bottle of whisky on her, I guess, at all times… [laughs]
Rhi: She is very prepared.
Minna: And also a handkerchief, because she always has a handkerchief, are you kidding me?
Kim: I mean, those are both on brand for Myra.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Minna: So, she stuffs the handker— I don’t actually know if that’s how you make a Molotov cocktail. [laughs]
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: Okay, thank you. I guess I also have like a flint or something, and I just—
Rhi: Yeah, I think you have, I mean, I think a lighter you can have without it being a thing.
Minna: And I just light it and I throw through the smoke. So they just see, spinning though the smoke, flame.
Rhi: Yeah.
[laughter]
Rhi: So, I think we see it form The Magpies side of things of just like, you throw it and it disappears into the smoke. And then there’s a shattering sound and “woomph” as this big fireball goes up. And then there is more screaming, and I think that because you got a 6, the three of you can basically charge through the smoke and veer around the two now on fire guards, who are both on the ground rolling around trying to put themselves out.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And you can, basically this is kind of a four-way intersection that you get to in the halls. So, you can pick a direction and run in it to get away.
Josie: I mean, I wasn’t expecting first-degree arson to be what we started with, but…
Rhi: I mean, hey.
Josie: So, they’re trying to put themselves out.
Rhi: Yes, yeah, they’re dealing with that situation.
Josie: I’m trying to decide, like, whether Minx is like, cruel enough right now to just like, finish them off while they’re doing that. Cause like, if they’re rolling around on fire, it’ll be pretty easy to put a sword through their chest. Like…
Rhi: It would.
Josie: But I’m trying to decide, like, character-wise, is that something Minx would do right now.
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, that’s a fairly… that’s kind of, in my mind, going from self-defense to murder.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: so, that’s a significant thing. I’m not saying don’t do it, but yeah.
Josie: She is kind of supposed to be on the upswing now, right?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Okay, yeah, I don’t think Minx is gonna finish them off. She is going to calmly pick up her dropped cane, but—
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah.
Josie: Otherwise, she’ll just hurry past.
Rhi: Okay. So, what direction do you go in? You’ve basically, so, it’s a four-way intersection, so we’ll say north, south, east, west. You came in from the south. The guards were to the west. So, which hallway do you run down?
Josie: Um… I guess the way they did not come from?
Rhi: Okay. They came from the north, they were running straight at you, and then they ducked to the west. So, you’re gonna go east.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, I think at this point you’re able to kind of sprint along and put some distance between yourselves and the guards you have set aflame. I think you kind of take a couple corners and head down some different hallways and then you can kinda stop and catch your breath and try and get your bearings.
Your next challenge is going to be finding the stuff that you came in for. Blaire has a very specific goal that she has not told either of you about. What she needs.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Minx, you’re hoping to get a ghost to sell.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: Yes. [laughs]
Rhi: And Minx also potentially could try to find some information about how to kill vampires. Myra, looking for information about how to defeat hulls.
Minna: Yep.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: How do you all wanna go about find— like, starting to try and get your bearings and figure out where you need to go to find this stuff?
Josie: Hmm.
Kim: I…
Minna: Is there a classification system?
Rhi: Mm hmm. I mean, realistically, there probably is, but you will have to find, you know, the card catalogue, essentially.
Minna: I mean, I’m going to find the card catalogue.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: This is how I do research.
Rhi: God bless. Okay.
Kim: Nerd!
Rhi: Yeah, roll something to start trying to locate where the—
Minna: Is that a Study? Can that be a Study?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah.
Minna: Aw, fuck me. It’s a 3.
Rhi: 3, okay. So, I was gonna say, you’ve, congratulations, moved up to risky. So, it’s no longer desperate. On a 3 though, you suffer harm or a complication occurs, you end up in a desperate position… I think the complication is I’m ticking up the Backup Arrives by one, so that’s now at 2 out of 3. I think that you can hear distantly, down the hall, like, the guards shouting as they have reached their compatriots and are now fanning out to look for you. And I think that you all kind of wander around a bit more, but are not able to find anything useful that seems to be anything that you’re looking for.
Kim: Yeah. Um, I was thinking of having Blaire roll an Attune to figure out where to go?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah.
Kim: Because I feel like she has a pretty good idea by now of what to look for, and has an idea of what this thing would look like in the ghost field.
Rhi: Yes. So, are you looking for your specific artifact, or are you trying to find the card catalogue so that your friends can go and find their stuff and you can find yours?
Kim: Oh, no. Blaire is being completely— yes, completely single-minded right now and just wants her thing.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Um, yeah.
Rhi: That’s fair. Yeah, so for an Attune you’re using your fine spirit mask. Risky, standard effect.
Kim: 5, 6, 3.
Rhi: 6, okay. So, I think that like, you all have been kind of like, hurrying through the halls just sort of at random. Like, trying doors and if they’re open you look inside to see if there’s anything useful. The unlocked doors don’t hold a lot of useful stuff, unsurprisingly.
And so, Blaire, I think that you, the three of you turn into a new hall and you look into the ghost field and behind a door that’s like, on the right side halfway down the hall, you can see— you’re guessing from the way that the things are arranged that there are shelves that seem to be holding just rows and rows and rows of little arcane objects. Like, they’re all— they all seem to be fairly small, but they are glowing very brightly with power.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: And you are able to recognize what looks like kind of a, sort of a box shape. There’s a lot of sort of glowing sigils in vaguely a cube.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: And then inside all of those sigils is a vial that is glowing, but— I feel like we’ve said that the ghost field is sort of like a blue-green, right?
Kim: Yes, we’ve said that. Yeah.
Rhi: This is glowing a neon purple and pink.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: You’ve never seen anything like it in the ghost field.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: It’s weird and you’re pretty sure it’s what you’re looking for.
Kim: And also, she would want it anyway.
Rhi: So yeah, you know what door it’s behind, you know where it is, you can go off after it if you would like.
Kim: Yeah, Blaire takes off. She doesn’t even say anything to you two, she just runs off after that.
Rhi: Uh, what do the two of you do when Blaire just hustles off down the hall?
Minna (as Myra): Uh— Oh— okay… guess she found what she’s looking for.
Josie (as Minx): Um— is it alright if I keep an eye on her?
Minna (as Myra): Yes, go ahead. I’ll keep looking over here.
Josie (as Minx): Alright.
Rhi: So, Minx follows after Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): What are you doing?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, I figured since you’re going afield, I’d watch your back.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, well try to keep up.
Josie (as Minx): And hey, where you’re going there’s probably going to be ghosts, so…
Kim (as Blaire): I can handle ghosts, let’s go.
Josie (as Minx): I— I am going. I was just thinking about fulfilling my end of the bargain.
Kim: Blaire doesn’t even respond. She just keeps moving.
Rhi: Oh, Minx.
Josie: Oh. [laughs]
Rhi: So Blaire, you reach this door.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Uh, it’s locked.
Kim: Um, how badly is it locked?
Rhi: Tier V.
Kim: Yeah, but I also have Tier V tools, so…
Rhi: You have Tier V arcane implements. You do not have Tier V lockpicks.
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. So, you can, you can try to pick the lock, but you’re going to be at severe disadvantage.
Kim: I know.
Rhi: Or, you can try to get through it in another way.
Kim: I was gonna say, since I have Tier V arcane implements, is it possible for me to just do some kinda spooky shit to unlock it?
Rhi: One of the items you have is a ghost key.
Kim: Oh, you’re so right. Duh!
Rhi: And I think I will allow the combination of ghost key and Tier V arcane implements. I will let you make a roll to try and unlock this with the ghost key.
Kim: This would be Attune then, right?
Rhi: Uh, yeah.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Risky, standard effect.
Kim: Great. Okay, that’s a 5.
Rhi: Huh… let’s see. [sighs]
Kim: I have an idea for a consequence, if you’d like?
Rhi: Yeah, hit me.
Kim: Um, she, you know, Blaire obviously breaks through the lock, but it’s rigged with a silent alarm?
Rhi: I mean, basically that would have me push security back up to 3 out of 3.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: The other thing, and I think I wanna have Josie chime in on how she feels about this. The ghost key kinda lets Blaire phase through the door, but Minx can’t follow her.
Kim: Ooh…
Josie: I…
Rhi: How do you feel about that? I don’t wanna—
Josie: To be honest, like… I kinda like that.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: That’s very good.
Josie: Like, Blaire’s just ploughing ahead and she phases through the door and Minx is like:
Josie (as Minx): Wait, hold on! Aw…
Rhi: Yeah. Um, cause then, like, on the one hand I think Blaire in the moment doesn’t see that as a bad thing, but it also means that she is going to be alone if anything bad happens in here.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah. So, yeah, do we wanna go with that?
Kim: I agree. It’s a very good consequence.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so do you wanna describe how this looks?
Kim: I think since it’s a Tier V ghost key, its… whatever material it’s made out of, it is like, extremely powerful. Possibly cursed? But, um—[laughs]
Rhi: Lightly cursed.
Kim: Blursed, if you will.
[laughter]
Kim: And I think as soon as she, like, whips it out of her pocket, it’s almost like drawn to this lock, like it leaves her hand and it’s just, it moves in and it turns it like it was meant for it.
Rhi: Oh, cool.
Kim: Yeah. And it’s just like a nothing thing. And as soon as it’s unlocked the lock, Blaire’s hand is just immediately pulled towards it like a magnet, and that is how she gets pulled, like phased through the door.
Rhi: That’s very cool. I like that, yeah. And then Minx is just… [laughs] left standing there. Let’s, real quick, jump back to Myra. You are continuing to look for—
Minna: A card catalogue, yes. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] “It’s an archive, there’s a reference desk somewhere in this place!”
Minna: Well, there has to be some… organization.
Rhi: Yeah, no, you are—
Minna: Like, even if it’s just like, I look at the shelf labels and I’m able to work out, okay, I’m understanding sort of what’s happening here.
Rhi: Yeah, I think the challenge is that what I’m picturing is that it’s just a lot of halls with doors.
Minna: Ah.
Rhi: Some of the doors are labelled, but a lot of them aren’t. Like, it’s set up as a place that it’s meant to be difficult for someone who doesn’t know the place to navigate.
Minna: Mm hmm.
Rhi: It’s another nice anti-intruder mechanism. So, yeah, but you can absolutely continue looking around try to find some kind of reference.
Minna: What’s my position and effect this time?
Rhi: Your position is going to be risky. Effect is gonna depend on what action.
Minna: Study again?
Rhi: Study, you’re gonna keep trying that? Okay. Yeah, I think it’s gonna be, unless you can think of something that you can use to bump this up, it’s gonna be reduced effect, so risky reduced. You’re welcome to push yourself or Devil’s Bargain in order to push that effect up if you’d like.
Minna: I have an item called blueprints.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Minna: Could that help me somehow?
Rhi: Sure.
Minna: Like, maybe I was able to get hold of, like, a general plan of the building, and I’m kind of cross-referencing, like, the door labels I can find with what’s on here, and then I’m like, “Well maybe,” like I can kind of start to see an organization happening.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, I will let you do that. Mark that off and you can have that up to standard effect.
Minna: Okay, I’ve rolled a 5.
Rhi: Okay. You do it, but there’s a consequence. So, I think that you pull out your blueprints, you start comparing it, you start walking around and you eventually push open a door that leads into, um, I’m picturing kind of like a rotunda sort of in the middle of the building. There’s some places in Chicago, some buildings in Chicago that have this, where the center of the building— like, the building itself is kind of a donut shape.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: And the center is just this, like, open courtyard. That’s kind of what I’m picturing, but instead of it being a courtyard, it’s just in the middle of the building is this glass rotunda. So, you can see, like, the sky overhead. It’s very cool.
And I think in the middle of this is a large desk with several large books that are like, chained to it. And you can kind of recognize immediately from, like, you rush over and you start looking at them, and like, this is— these are the ledgers. There’s not a card catalogue per se, but this is where that is stored here is written down and inventoried. Each ledger kind of refers to a certain block of rooms. So, you can start perusing those. However… the complication. I’m gonna tick— oh man. Do I wanna tick up ghost horde or have security arrive?
Kim: Friends. Bring friends. Not cops.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Well, they’re both gonna get here eventually. I’m gonna tick up ghost horde. So that’s Ghost Horde Arrives is at 3 out of 4. Security Backup Arrives is at 2 out of 3.
Minna: Amazing.
Rhi: If I’m lucky, everyone will arrive at once.
Minna: [laughs]
Kim: I fucking hate clocks.
Rhi: [laughs] I love them with all of my whole entire heart. How do you wanna proceed, Myra?
Minna: Generally, I’m still trying to figure out this system, which I realize is very boring listening, but is how she would approach it.
Rhi: I mean, basically I think if you want to, like, look through these ledgers and try to find the information that you and possibly your compatriots are looking for, you can make a roll to do that.
Minna: I would like to do this.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think just looking through these books is gonna be risky position, standard effect. While you are doing that, Minx, did you stay in the hallway outside where Blaire is, or did you follow Myra? I think that it all happened fast enough that if you wanted to follow Myra, you could.
Josie: I think she’s flabbergasted enough to chill in that hallway for a sec.
Rhi: Okay. So, Minx is standing outside the door in the hallway. I’m picturing her just knocking on it very sadly. “Blaire?”
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Aww!
Rhi: “Blaire, please.”
Josie: [laughs] I do think she does knock. Is like:
Josie (as Minx): You’re not gonna unlock it from that side? Okay.
Rhi: So, is Minx just hanging out in that hallway for the moment?
Josie: Well, she’s gonna try and look and see if there’s other rooms to go into.
Rhi: Okay. In that case, we will hop back to you in a second after we resolve Myra’s roll.
Minna: 5.
Rhi: 5, okay. I said risky standard. Okay, so I think that you find basically there is a— there’s a block of rooms that’s basically the library. There are books kept here. Tomes that are forbidden and banned elsewhere in the Empire. And you flip through that and you are able to find some references to things that you’re pretty sure will have the information that you and Minx need for hulls and vampires. Unfortunately, just as you find this information, the doors to this room burst open and… three guards come rushing in, guns drawn. As I have completed the clock of Backup Arrives.
Minna: [whines]
Rhi: And so, they come rushing in and see you.
Josie: Well, did I just hear a door burst open?
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, I think you could hear the sound of the guards bursting into that room. I don’t think that Myra is super far away from you.
Josie: Okay. In that case I’m gonna pull out a second pistol and draw my sord and make my way that way.
Rhi: Okay. Are you gonna try and slip in sneakily, or are you just gonna rush in and…?
Josie: I’m gonna try and sneak up on them.
Rhi: Okay. Then that’s going to be, I think, probably Prowl. And it’s gonna be risky, reduced effect.
Josie: Why reduced effect?
Rhi: Because they’re Tier V.
Josie: [grumbles]
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I don’t like that, Rhi.
Rhi: Well, I’m sorry.
Josie: What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: Devils Bargain… um… I think that you’re gonna leave something identifiable behind. Like, in the course of your running down the hallway sneaking into this place, you drop something that is either going to tie to you specifically or to The Magpies. Like, you drop a pin. [laughs]
Josie: I think that’s fine.
Rhi: Okay. That’s gonna make a note that you’re gonna have—
Josie: We’re taking a lot of heat.
Rhi: You’re taking so much heat.
Josie: But I think we were gonna get a lot of heat anyway. 6.
Rhi: And that Devil’s Bargain was for an extra die?
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Okay. So, you were still—
Josie: Oh no, wait.
Rhi: Did you want—
Josie: No, I should roll again. I wanted it to be increased effect.
Rhi: Increased effect? Okay.
Josie: Yeah. Let’s just start fresh. Still a 6.
Rhi: [laughs] Alright, it’s meant to be. That was an even better roll. Okay, so in that case I think you’re able to just, like, jump on one of them, and I don’t think that you, like, kill them outright, but you’re able to stab them in such a way that they’re incapacitated.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So, Myra, you like stand up from this book and see three guards rush in, and then one of them just gets tackled in a clatter.
Josie: [laughs] Boom.
Rhi: Let’s cut over to Blaire.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Blaire, you have just phased through a door.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: I’m pretty sure you’ve never done that before.
Kim: Nope.
Rhi: So, that’s an experience to sort of contemplate. While you’re contemplating that, what you see in this room are kinda, as you guessed, several rows of shelves that are like five or six shelves apiece. They’re pretty tall.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: On these shelves are these basically cages that are just, like, bolted down. Like, the shelves are metal and then there’s cages that are bolted to the metal shelves.
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: And inside each cage is a thing. There are bones, there are vials, there are scales, there are, uh, engraved stones, there are what look like clumps of rags and fur. It’s just this vast collection of arcane relics and artifacts. And you can, uh, you know, if you kind of like pop into the ghost field again, the thing you’re looking for stands out like a beacon, because it’s such a different color than what you’re used to seeing.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So, you can make your way over to it without any trouble. Where you are gonna run into trouble is that it is ensconced in this cage that you’re gonna have to contend with.
Kim: What do I have to do to make this thing coming out of its cage?
Rhi: [laughs] I mean, you can try and pick a lock, you can try and figure out another way to get around it.
Kim: You know what? I feel like it’s been a while since I’ve had Blaire do any tinkering, so I’m gonna have her pick the lock.
Rhi: Okay. Risky, uh, what kind of tinkerers tools do you have? You just have regular?
Kim: Uh…
Rhi: It would be burglary gear, I think, basically, right? I don’t think you have tinkerer’s tools.
Kim: I don’t… oh, no, I do. I do. I do have tinkering tools.
Rhi: Okay, but they’re just regular ones? They’re not fine or anything?
Kim: Yeah, yeah, just regular tinkering tools.
Rhi: Okay. So, this is gonna be risky position, zero effect.
Kim: Mm. Don’t like that.
Rhi: You will have to push yourself or take a bargain in order to have any effect on this lock from this approach. If you wanna try a different approach, that might change the calculus there.
Kim: Er…. Bargain?
Rhi: You’re not sure what happened to the ghost key after you phased through the door.
Kim: That’s fine. I don’t really need to know.
Rhi: Well, I’m just— it could be a problem later. Because it’s a ghost key, it’s not supposed to just wander off.
Kim: That’s…
Rhi: It’s a key.
Kim: Its still a problem for future Blaire. I’ll take it.
Rhi: Yup.
[laughter]
Rhi: That’s— that’s the spirit. Alright.
Kim: Uh… [laughs]
Rhi: So, you’re using that to push up to reduced effect?
Kim: Yes. Uh— ooh! Guess who critted?
Rhi: [laughs loudly]
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Okay. Uh, critical, you do it with increased effect, so that means standard effect.
Kim: Fuck yes.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, fuck. I will, with a critical, yeah, you can pop the lock open.
Kim: Yeah. What else can I do with a critical?
Rhi: You can get the lock open. [laughs]
Kim: That’s it?
Rhi: Listen, you started at zero effect.
Kim: Fair. Okay. Okay, yes.
Rhi: You got the cage open.
Kim: I will— I got it out of its cage, I am now doing just fine, I will not be greedy.
Rhi: Tell me about this box. Describe it for me.
Kim: I think that it’s a small wooden chest with, like, these iron parquet filagree on each corner. And it is ancient. It is an old, old box. Like, it’s probably made of a wood of a tree that does not exist anymore.
Rhi: I think it’s cedar. I think that, yeah, I don’t think cedar trees can grow anymore.
Kim: No.
Rhi: They’re too big for a greenhouse.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: And so, like, you can smell it faintly, and it’s a smell you’ve never experienced before.
Kim: Yeah. Oh… what if this becomes like Blaire’s favorite new smell? I can see her going for like an earthly, pine smell. Anyway.
Rhi: Mm hmm, yeah.
Kim: Even though it’s old and somewhat plain, it’s like, it’s very refined also, if that makes sense?
Rhi: Yeah, It’s well-craft.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Are you gonna open it up?
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. So, Blaire opens it.
Kim: It’s velvet lined.
Rhi: Of course. And I think that the bottom has kind of an extra, like, cushioning on it.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: And resting on that cushion is a, uh, a glass vial, but not like a test tube vial. It’s kind of almost more like a flask. It’s a little wider.
Kim: Is it like a round potion bottle, almost?
Rhi: I was thinking more of like a teardrop shape.
Kim: Ooh, I love that. Yes.
Rhi: And it’s, uh, it has like a metal cap on it that screws on. But it was also sealed with wax at some point, but it’s so old that most of the wax has, like, cracked, and you can very easily flake it off if you want.
Kim: I love it.
Rhi: And inside is a thick, kinda purpley liquid that also has a sort of like, um, oil slick, rainbow sheen to it, the way that it looks like when there’s gas or oil on top of water in the street.
Kim: Yep, yep, yep.
Rhi: So, it kind of has kind of that rainbow sheen, but it’s like a sickly, like it’s not a pretty rainbow. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah, it’s like all of these muddy greens and yellows and it’s— yeah.
Rhi: Mm hmm. And so, as you kinda turn it in the light, the color sort of shifts. But the base color is this very like, dark, bruised, purple. And yeah, if you look into the ghost field, I think that you can see that it’s just this weird glow of purple and bright pink. And I think now that you’re closer to it there’s kind of some other flecks of other colors that your brain’s having a little trouble processing.
Kim: They’re colors that I’ve never seen before. We’re getting into like, mantis shrimp territory.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, it’s like your brain doesn’t quite know how to translate some of these. But you got it. This is the thing that you came here for and you have it.
Kim: Cool. Can Blaire continue, like, just absolutely wrecking this room and tearing through and just bring home some souvenirs?
Rhi: She can try, but you’re going to have to make— like, you’re going to have to spend the time to pick the lock on each and every one of these.
Kim: Oh shit.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, they’re all locked. And you will have, unless you spend stress or Devil’s Bargains or something, zero effect on all of them.
Kim: Alright, fuck that. That’s too bad. Alright. That’s fine.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah.
Kim: I should just cut my losses and accept that I made it this far. [laughs]
Rhi: Yep. Okay, so I think we see, um, Blaire heading up towards the door, which you can now unlock and just leave. And I think we’re gonna cut back over to the rotunda to see what she hears when she emerges.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: So, when we left off, Minx had just tackled someone and done them a stabbing.
Josie: Uh huh.
Rhi: Uh, Myra? There’s two guards who are unstabbed, that were moving in on you, but now have kind of like hesitated for a second because another player has entered the field and they’re trying to be like, “Oh shit, what do we do?” So Myra, what would you like to do?
Minna: I’d like to throw the book at them.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: The book is chained— the book is chained to the desk.
Minna: Damnit! [laughs]
Rhi: I’m sorry. I established that earlier.
Minna: I forgot.
Rhi: Or else I would fully support this. But you cannot. [laughs]
Kim: Is there another—
Minna: [through laughter] I’m sorry that I’m embracing chaotic energy tonight.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: So what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna leap over the desk and then— well, I guess not leap over there. Go behind the desk and then use it as cover to shoot at them.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. You can definitely do that.
Minna: Is that a Skirmish?
Rhi: This is going to be… so, desperate.
Minna: That’s a 6.
Rhi: Reduced effe— why are you like this? [laughs]
Minna: I didn’t mean to! [laughs]
Rhi: I know, I know. It’s just you always get, like, the best goddamn rolls. Okay, so you do it, but it is still reduced effect. So, what are you trying to accomplish with your shooting?
Minna: I am trying to… honestly., make them go away. [laughs]
Rhi: So, kind of doing the suppressing fire, the way that Minx was earlier?
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. So, I think that they are going to duck kind of back into doorways so that they do have cover from your wild shots. But they’re not— they’re not totally gone. Like, if you pop up from the desk, they’ll be able to shoot at you. They’re just not immediately in the room. That’s the reduced effect piece of it. You got them to back off, you haven’t gotten them to leave. Minx?
Josie: Uh—
Rhi: You have disentangled yourself from the person that you stab-tackled.
Josie: Uh huh. What condition are they in?
Rhi: They are unharmed. They just backed off because there are a lot of bullets flying and they’re smart and well-trained and…
Josie: No, the person I tackled.
Rhi: Oh, the person you tackled, I’m sorry. They are incapacitated, basically. You got— I don’t remember what the roll was, but you got a good enough roll that you just took them out in one.
Josie: And the other two backed out into the hallway?
Rhi: They’re like in the doorways. There’s a lot of doors leading into this central room. So, they’ve kind of like stepped back into the doorways so that Myra can’t shoot at them, but they still have line of sight on particularly the desk where Myra is, possibly on you. Kinda depending on how die rolls go. So, like, they’ve basically given themselves more cover, but they can still shoot.
Josie: To be honest, I think I’m gonna do the same thing?
Rhi: Okay. Like, duck into a doorway?
Josie: Yeah. Back into the doorway I came in through and fire at the one I have the best line of sight on.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you can do that. Uh… yeah, it’s gonna be desperate reduced.
Josie: Yeah. You know what? I’m just gonna take the roll as is this time.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, we’re getting to the point in the score where I think a lot of stress has been spent.
Josie: Mm…
Rhi: Ooh.
Josie: Mm… 3…
Rhi: 3. Not good on a desperate roll. It’s the worst outcome.
Josie: Mm. Oh right. [nervous laugh]
Rhi: Let me think. Okay, here’s what’s gonna happen. So, we see Minx back into the doorway and raise her gun to take aim. And then we kind of cut away from this whole situation to that side door again that you all came through. And there is a shimmer in the air as a ghost key appears and unlocks something. And a door opens, not the actual physical door, but a door.
Josie: Uh huh…
Rhi: And the ghost horde pours through.
Kim: [hums a tune]
Josie: Mm…
Rhi: And by horde, I do mean horde. We are talking probably 40 to 50 ghosts.
Kim: Holy shit! Really?
Minna: 40 to 50 feral hogs in three to five minutes.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. Listen, it’s the worst outcome. So, this place is now flooded with spirits. And the cultists took down the spirit wards. So, there are no protections up to stop them.
Kim: Holy shit, this is bad.
Josie: [nervous laugh]
Rhi: So, Minx, I think that, like, I think what happens is just by the sheer number of ghosts, all three of you, like, everyone in this building, feels the temperature plummet. Like, the building just goes ice cold. You can see your breath, all three of you, no matter where you are. And I think that even without looking into the ghost field, you can just sense that something very large is moving through the ghost field.
Josie: Oh jeez.
Kim: Zoinks, Scoob.
Rhi: That was Minx. Myra took some shots. Blaire. I think that when you had come out into the hallway, you heard the gunshots. You gonna head towards your friends?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. So, you run towards the gunshots. I think just as you reach a door, I think you’re coming into a different door than where Minx did, that’s when you feel that temperature drop.
Kim: Uh huh.
Rhi: So Blaire, what would you like to do? You can see, I think when you get to the doorway, I think you can see Myra ducked behind a desk, you can see Josie and— not Josie, you can see Minx and the guards in their doorways with guns. And you can tell that shit is about to get very ghostly and tense in here.
Kim: I want to roll a Command and see if I can get all of these ghosts to sic the guards and leave us alone.
Rhi: Desperate, zero effect.
Kim: [sighs] See, I was already gonna push myself to Command.
Josie: I’ll assist.
Kim: Thank you.
Josie: To push it up to reduced effect.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I appreciate that. Um…
Rhi: So, desperate, reduced.
Kim: I will push myself to give myself an extra die. Is there anything else I can do to help with the effects, or…
Rhi: No. [laughs]
Kim: Okay! We’re doing a plunge!
Rhi: Unless you’ve got some item on you that you wanna make an argument for.
Kim: Let me check out my equipment. Maybe.
Rhi: You know what? I will say… let me look at the description of arcane implements. You might be able to use the Tier V arcane implements to get yourself up to standard. Let me look at the description of what that is.
Kim: Possibly.
Rhi: Yeah. I will— you can use kind of the combination of Minx helping, pushing yourself, using these arcane implements, you can get it up to desperate, standard.
Kim: Alright. I’m gonna roll these 2d6 and hope for the best, I suppose. Okay. Uh, 5 and a 1.
Rhi: What do you say to them? What do you say to the ghosts to Command them?
Kim: I think all that Blaire is going to say is that she’s going to point to the guards and say:
Kim (as Blaire): They’re the ones you want.
Rhi: What happens when that many ghosts try to possess just two people?
Kim: I mean, I have to imagine that it’s like, almost like a piranha feeding. Like, they just swarm it and they don’t care about the collateral damage at all. They’re just all trying.
Rhi: I think you’ve just caused two harvesters to form.
Josie: Oh…
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: They just all sort of coalesced on these two points and spontaneously— I think it’s also a factor of the fact that, like, there’s just so much arcane energy in this place.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: That they all just swarmed together and…
Josie: But they’re not immediately a harvester, right? We have a chance to run?
Rhi: Mm, no, they’re pretty much immediately harvesters.
Josie: [panicking]
Rhi: No chance to run.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Um—
Rhi: Just remember, fire doesn’t stop them. [laughs]
Josie: Uh huh!
Kim: Uh…
Rhi: So, I think they, like, they just swarm and then there’s these horrible echoing shrieks that are, you know, this voice of the legion effect, from both of them.
Kim: Ques… question.
Rhi: Yeah, lay it on me.
Kim: Do you think it’s possible for Blaire to jar up two harvesters?
Rhi: No.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: We talked about with— it’s too much. It’s basically a one ghost per jar rule.
Kim: Oh, right.
Rhi: And that’s like, at minimum, 20 ghosts apiece.
Kim: Shit.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah.
Kim: Uh, is there anything I can do to clean up this mess? Because Blaire got in trouble because of harvesters in the past.
Rhi: Mm hmm. She did. Yeah.
Kim: [laughs] Please don’t make me deal with these consequences. We can resist anything in this game!
Rhi: Yeah. You wanna resist?
Josie: Oh yeah, that’s a good idea.
Kim: Uh…
Rhi: You can resist the consequence of this action.
Kim: I can. What do I have to roll to resist?
Rhi: Resolve.
Kim: Resolve?
Rhi: Roll Resolve.
Kim: Okay. Because I actually did reading for once in my life, I just realized the Iron Will gives me plus 1d6 to Resolve resistance rolls, so…
Rhi: Hey, look at you.
Kim: Yeah. And I’m pretty sure I’ve played this game this entire life having— I started the game with Iron Will.
Rhi: You did. [laughs]
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: And I did not know this until now. [laughs]
Josie: To be fair, we don’t do resistance rolls for Resolve very often.
Rhi: You don’t roll Resolve, yeah, too often. Yeah. But… so, go for it.
Kim: My highest was a 4.
Rhi: Okay. So, you will take two points of stress.
Kim: Oh no. [laughs]
Rhi: What happens, Blaire?
Kim: No, I’m getting close. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I’m good. I’m good.
Rhi: What are you at?
Kim: I have one stress to spare. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Aah!
Rhi: Where are you two at, Minx and Myra, for stress?
Josie: 4.
Rhi: Oh damn. Crushing it.
Minna: Uh… yeah. I’m 3. I haven’t used it a lot.
Kim: Mom, come pick me up, I’m scared!
Rhi: [laughs] Okay.
Josie: We came in empty, so.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s good. They are pre-harvesters and you could interrupt it and sort of disperse the ghosts again.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: You’d have to take the time to do it, though.
Kim: Ugh, this is so hard. This is so hard. Because—
Josie: And then if we disperse the ghosts, we’re back where we started.
Rhi: Right. [laughs] You can basically get back to there’s 40 feral ghosts.
Kim: That’s true. But I can at least Command them.
Rhi: You can try to Command them again, yeah.
Kim: As much as I wanna clean up this mess, we just gotta bail. We gotta keep this show moving anyway.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: So, the two guards are no longer a problem, and there’s basically the ghosts are all kind of— the ghosts are just sort of swirling together and shrieking in those doorways. But they’re not bothering the three of you. So like, Minx and Myra can kinda come up out of cover. I’m starting another clock, just to keep track of the harvester situation.
Minna: The Reconciled aren’t gonna like this.
Rhi: No, they’re really not.
Josie: So, it seems like the result of this score is Blaire got what she wanted, we didn’t, and also now harvesters.
Rhi: Well, I mean, do you two wanna try to— Myra knows where you need to go to get the stuff that you need.
Kim: Gang, I am more than happy with trying to hold them off while you try to get what you need, because I do want—
Minna: Let’s do that.
Kim: Out of character, I do want everyone to get what they want out of this score.
Josie: Yeah. Let’s get Myra what she needs. Like, if I don’t get what I need, we just lose out on some money.
Rhi: Okay. And I mean, actually, like, the books that you need that have the information are in basically the same place, so you two can get your info. Minx might not be able to get the ghost.
Josie: Right. And I’m thinking I’m gonna come back to that noble family and be like, “Well, we didn’t get the ghost…”
Rhi: However… [laughs]
Josie: “But if you have resources to offer in dealing with a harvester, you’ll probably get in good.” [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] “With a what?”
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, so, can we— I wanna play out this scene of Blaire being like, “Go.”
Kim: Yes, absolutely.
Rhi: So, the thee of you are seeing this, the ghosts swirling together and shrieking.
Josie (as Minx): Oh God, we need to get out of here.
Kim (as Blaire): No. Get what you need, I can take care of this.
Josie (as Minx): I— weren’t we not going to split?
Kim (as Blaire): Go!
Josie (as Minx): Especially for this—
Josie: Minx will just raise her hand and go.
Rhi: Alright. Myra, you going as well?
Minna: Yes, absolutely.
Rhi: Okay. Uh, so I think Myra can lead the way to the library section. And your first hurdle is that the door is locked.
Minna: MM. Yeah.
Josie: Oh, who gives a shit at this point? Let’s blow it open.
Minna: [laughs] Yes.
Rhi: [laughs] Somebody wanna mark demolition tools?
Josie: Um…
Rhi: Yeah, the element of secrecy is well and truly lost.
Josie: Yeah. I don’t think it’s explosives, I think Minx just has fucking, like, a hammer.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. The same way that you took down Tesslyn’s front door.
Josie: Yeah. And just gonna roll to fuckin’ knock the knob in.
Rhi: Yeah, I’m gonna say risky, reduced effect, because it’s a tough door.
Josie: Uh, Devil’s Bargain?
Rhi: This is gonna set off another alarm, and I’m gonna start another clock for additional security coming to check on you.
Kim: [groans]
Josie: I mean, that makes thematic sense with what I’m doing, so I think I’ll take it to increase effect. I got a 6.
Rhi: Nice. Yeah, you bash the door down and an alarm starts ringing distantly, and my new clock, Security Backup Part 2, Electric Boogaloo, is at 1 out of 4. But you get the door down. Just [smashing sound]. They had all kinds of security against, you know, spiritual tampering or lock-picking. Did not plan for someone just bashing it down with a hammer.
Josie: Yeah. But I mean, who gives a shit? And like, their attention isn’t going to go to where the noise of 50 screaming ghosts was?
Rhi: [laughs] I mean, listen, depending on how these guards are feeling about their lives, they might be like, “You know what? I bet that alarm is less likely to kill us.”
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: “Let’s go over there.” So, they’re at 1 out of 4. So yeah, you break into this room and it is, it’s a library. It’s a nice library. Nice wood shelves, plush carpets, there’s some armchairs, like, Myra could hang out in here for days. She’s not going to, but she could. And I think, Myra, in the books there were kind of like, you know, shelf numbers.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So, you’re able to sort of both of you be like, “Okay, go.” And I think I am gonna have you both make some kind of roll to, like, locate your specific books and find the info that you need. This is mostly to see how much time this takes you.
Josie: Mm hmm. I’m gonna roll my Survey.
Rhi: Yeah, so this is actually just gonna be risky, standard. Actually, risky, greater effect, because Myra had the information of where things are specifically.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: 5, okay.
Minna: 6.
Rhi: Myra, what’d you get? 6? Okay. Uh, so let’s start with Myra, actually, because that will be easier. So Myra, you, like, you live and breathe libraries, you know just instinctively how to find stuff. You zip down an aisle, find the book that you need, start paging— like, you go to the index, find the info that you need. And what you learn, and this is gonna complete your research project for how to defeat a hull. How many ticks did you have left on that?
Minna: Uh, I think I only had one.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s what I thought.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: So, this is gonna complete that. You— the piece that you are missing, because all of these things that you found about hulls didn’t explain kind of how the spirit actually is bonded to the hull. That information is really tightly controlled by the Spirit Wardens, and by the Archive of Echoes.
So, how the spirit is contained, or is bound to the hull. It is contained within a soul vessel, which is a memento from the spirit’s life. It’s something that this person cared about when they were alive. In order to destroy the soul vessel, you have to kind of get ahold of the vessel. A ritual has to be performed to reverse the wards that are binding the spirit to the vessel, then you can shatter the vessel and it will release the spirit. That’s how you stop a hull.
Josie: Alright. I know hulls were already fucked up….
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: But…
Rhi: I know.
Josie: Like, the people creating them need to learn about the person they’re putting in there and get something valuable to them, too.
Rhi: It’s— I would like to point out, I didn’t make that up.
Minna: What?
Rhi: That’s from the book. [laughs]
Josie: I know!
Minna: Well, on the upside, at least I know the person who became the hull fairly well.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah, but it’s like, okay, I was gonna go with the argument that it’s like, a dehumanization thing and people are okay with it and Spirit Wardens go along with it because it’s like, easy to dehumanize the person, right? But it’s like, no, you need to get to know them and then consciously still do this to them.
Rhi: It’s so fucked up.
Minna: [whines]
Josie: Although, the fact that they tightly control this information means that the public would likely not be okay with it.
Rhi: Mm hmm. So, Myra, you can just take this book if you want.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Because it has the information about the ritual in it, so you can just pocket it. Minx, it takes you a little bit longer, basically, is what this is. Cause you are not as in tune with the library environment. But you do find the book that Myra told you about, page through it, and you find— it’s a, the book is a couple centuries old and it is kind of a description of a movement that was sort of popular back in sort of the 600s where people sort of took the idea of the spirit being bad to a logical conclusion of, “If I become a vampire, then I will never die and my spirit will never be unleashed upon the world, so clearly this is the right way to go.”
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: And so, this is kind of a record of that time, basically of some Spirit Wardens talking about how to deal with vampires. How to defeat them. Like, you basically have Spirit Warden: Vampire Hunter Edition. It’s a guide for hunting vampires. And basically, what you learn, how to destroy a vampire permanently, because the thing about vampires is that their spirit— like, the way that a living person works is that there’s the body and the spirit are together, but they’re kinda two separate things. You can pull them apart. If you kill somebody, their spirit comes out of the body.
Josie: Uh huh.
Rhi: For a vampire, the spirit has just sort of diffused and bonded with the body. You can’t separate them.
Josie: Oh, okay.
Rhi: So, the only way to defeat a vampire is to fully destroy the body in the way that the Spirit Wardens, like, destroy bodies to destroy a spirit, the way that they do at the crematorium. There’s like a special electroplasm solution that they have to dunk the corpse in to fully destroy it.
Josie: Jeez.
Rhi: Otherwise, no matter how much damage you do to the vampire’s body, it will eventually regenerate and come back.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: A lot of it talks about basically, like, rendering the vampire immobile in various ways and then dumping the body into the electroplasm to destroy it, because you can’t— like, there’s one story of, like, we [laughs] we beheaded a vampire and it came back a couple weeks later.
Minna: [gasps]
Josie: Oh jeez.
Rhi: However, it takes you time to do this. So, I’m gonna tick up both of these clocks to indicate time passing. You can also just take this book with you for all of its juicy vampire huntin’ lore.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Okay, so while the two of you are reading some books. Blaire.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Harvesters are happening in front of you. Slowly.
Kim: Well, pre-harvesters.
Rhi: Per-harvesters. They’re becoming harvesters. Are you gonna do anything to try to interfere with this process, or are you just gonna kinda let this ride? [laughs]
Kim: I feel like I sh— uh… let me put it this way. 40 to 50 feral ghouls is marginally better than two harvesters.
Rhi: Eh, yeah.
Kim: Right? I’m gonna try and prevent this from happening.
Rhi: Okay, how are you gonna do that?
Kim: [laughs] I’m so afraid. Um… uh, I… I don’t know. All I know is that it would have to be Attune, I would think.
Rhi: Yeah. You could use your arcane implements again.
Kim: Yes, I agree.
Rhi: I mean, if you just wanna kind of— so you, like, there was that score where you kinda broke up a pre-harvester at the request of The Reconciled.
Kim: Uh, Setarra did the heavy lifting, I think?
Rhi: Yeah, Setarra helped.
Kim: Yeah. I think… and I can’t push myself because I only have one stress.
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, you can try to basically just sort of— Blaire can like, improvise a ritual to try and interfere with this, with the arcane implements. You can do that.
Kim: I like that. Let’s have that be my Attune roll.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay. This is gonna be desperate.
Kim: Okay. So, I mark XP?
Rhi: Mark XP, yeah. You all are getting so much XP this score. [laughs] Desperate, standard effect, because they’re Tier V implements.
Kim: Okay, good. That was two 2s and 6.
Rhi: Okay, so you got a 6. So, you do it. So, what is— is your goal to just, like, stop the process entirely?
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Okay. I think, yeah, you can do that, but now, ghosts. [laughs]
Kim: That’s fine. I can handle ghosts.
Rhi: The ghosts are— yeah. The ghosts are all loose and just sorta floating around.
Kim: They’re definitely just like circling me very hungrily.
Rhi: Mm hmm. Yeah. I think that their attention has— they’re not moving in aggressively yet.
Kim: Not yet.
Rhi: Not yet.
Kim: But its definitely vulture city.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, they’re eyeballing you. Alright, Minx, Myra, you come rushing back to the rotunda. There is Blaire.
Josie: Uh…
Rhi: She’s surrounded by like, a gently twirling whirlpool of ghosts.
Minna: Oh…
Rhi: It’s not like, moving super fast, but she is surrounded.
Josie: Uh huh. Huh. Uh… hmm… mm…
Rhi: [laughs] That was a great collection of sounds.
Josie: Fuck.
Kim: Minx noises.
Josie: Also, my load is tapped out. Um…
Rhi: What was Myra doing?
Minna: Walking forward.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire? Are you—
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Minna (as Myra): Do you need some help?
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Josie (as Minx): Can we go now?
Minna (as Myra): Are you alright?
Kim (as Blaire): I’m fine. Um, yeah. Yeah. We can go now.
Minna (as Myra): [hesitantly] Can you come back to us first?
Kim: Blaire just blinks a couple times and the, um, spirit sight just kinda fades from her eyes and she’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. Yeah, I can.
Kim: And she’s gonna walk over back to you.
Rhi: Okay. I think there’s gonna need to be some kind of final roll for you all to get out, away from these ghosts.
Josie: We do have a Tier V crew securing our escape route.
Rhi: Yes, and they will keep the ghosts from following you out of the building, but you have to make it to the exit.
Minna: I can lead a group roll.
Josie: Um… yes please.
Rhi: Yeah, what do you all wanna roll? Do you just wanna, like, fuckin’ book it? [laughs]
Kim: I think we have to, yeah.
Minna: Yeah, let’s do a Prowl.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Alright. So, this is gonna be, I think, risky, because again you’ve got your Tier V group waiting outside to assist. We’ll say standard effect.
Josie: I got a 4.
Kim: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: 6.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Woo, no stress.
Rhi: Result is a 6, so I think that uh, Blaire kinda moves through the ghosts and backs up to the two, or the other two of you, and then the ghosts sort of stop swirling as they realize that the person they were interested in has moved, and they just all sort of, almost as one, turn and look at you three. And then, running. [laughs] Just sprinting through the halls, and I think you come out and, uh, you hear Vidrana shout:
Rhi: (as Vidrana): Now!
Rhi: And just in this rush of, again, like you can feel that kind of static electricity in the air, all the wards snap back up. So, those ghosts are now trapped inside this building, but that’s someone else’s problem. [laughs]
Kim: They can deal with it. They have the means.
Josie: Mm hmm.
Rhi: And I think that she just, like, looks at you kind of like, wide-eyed and is like:
Rhi (as Vidrana): Run. Get out. Go.
Rhi: [laughs] And her people are like, immediately breaking and scattering. She’s just like, get out. This situation is so hot, flee. So, you three go. You run and you make it back outta Whitecrown, and I assume just sprint home.
Josie: Uh huh!
Rhi: Minx and Myra, what do the two of you do when you get back? What’s kinda your immediate post-score routine?
Josie: I think Minx is gonna gently set her book down on the table, make to open it, think better of it, and just goes to her room and goes to sleep. She’s stressed, nats. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, that’s fair. So, Minx has passed out. Myra, you did get kinda banged up pretty badly, so I don’t know if you want to, like, take care of that wound or immediately go out to see Seeks.
Minna: I think she’s doing like a— they’re probably all quite tired. I think she’s gonna clean it up as best she can on her own, assuming it’s— I mean, I’m assuming it’s stopped bleeding and everything, so she’s just gonna clean it up the best she can and like, go to Seeks later.
Rhi: Yeah. See her in the morning. So, Myra has probably gone into the bathroom to tend to this wound. Blaire. So, you’ve got this thing that Setarra asked you for.
Kim: Mm hmm. Yeah, she doesn’t talk to anybody, she just immediately goes to her room, slams the door shut and she’s just there for the rest of the night.
Rhi: Yeah. Just studying this thing that she’s gotten.
Kim: Yup.
Rhi: So, I think, uh, a few days pass. The Magpies clean themselves up, get some sleep, burn off a lot of stress, and then we see Blaire leaving the nest alone. She’s got a big, heavy-looking pack. And where do you think that you and Setarra are meeting?
Kim: We usually meet at the docks… you know what? You know what I like even better? I think that Blaire is, she’s walking along the docks, but she and Setarra meet at this abandoned cave on the shore that’s like very— like, probably a mile away from the last bit of docks that there are.
Rhi: Okay, so like outside the lightning barrier? Let me look at the map. You know what? I think if you wanna meet at a cave, I would say you could go out on— you could go out on like, the edge. Basically anywhere along the…
Kim: Six Towers or Brightstone?
Rhi: Six Towers or Brightstone, yeah, alongside that edge there that’s facing the Lost District.
Kim: Also Nightmarket.
Rhi: I have a cool idea.
Kim: Go on.
Rhi: So, there’s the lightning barriers here, on the opposite side of the river. You could get, like, a little dinghy, a rowboat, and row across and like, there’s a cave that’s just below the lightning barriers.
Kim: I love it.
Rhi: So, like, you’re just barely inside the barricade.
Kim: Yeah, I like that a lot.
Rhi: And it’s on the other side of the river from the city. Yeah, that’s cool. So, I think, yeah, we see Blaire making her way up through Six Towers and like, climbing down into the catacombs where there’s a little rowboat that she’s tied up. Rows herself across, drags it up on to the shore on the opposite side of the river. The lightning barriers are crackling overhead. What does Blaire’s expression look like as she’s getting ready to walk in?
Kim: Uncharacteristically serious, but very characteristically determined.
Rhi: And then she walks into the cave and disappears into the darkness.

"Season 3, Episode 21: The Score of Their Dreams Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall and to the end of Season 3. Thank you all so much for listening. We have gotten such incredible support from all of you wonderful people over the last three seasons from reviews to tweets to fan art to Patreon support and more. You’re the best.
Today’s episode is a weird one. I’m really proud of how it turned out, and I hope you’ll enjoy it too. That said, I do need to give a few content warnings for the episode as a whole. Setarra’s brand of emotionally abusive mentor is back along with a lot of hallucinations and some vague descriptions of cosmic horrors. Like I said, it’s a weird one.
I also want to give you all a preview for what’s next as it’s going to be a little bit before Season 4 starts. Our next episode will be our now traditional Q&A end of season wrap-up which was a ton of fun to record. Then, we have a two-part bonus episode in which we test drive one of the Blades in the Dark add-ons, Leviathan Song, about the leviathan hunter ships and the people who sail on them. Then, Season 4 will begin in mid-September.
Next, let me tell you about this month’s Featured Charity.
The Okra Project is, to quote their website, a collective that seeks to address the global crisis faced by Black trans people by bringing home-cooked, healthy, and culturally specific meals and resources to Black trans people. The project provides food and meals in a variety of ways and has expanded to offer cooking classes, an international grocery fund, and self-care opportunities. Visit TheOkraProject.com or check out the link in the show notes to donate.
In addition, I strongly recommend looking for ways to support your local bail funds and civil rights organizations. What’s happening in Portland, Oregon right now is terrifying, and the administration is promising to spread this campaign of federal policing without transparency or accountability across the nation. We need to be prepared to fight this in whatever ways we can.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Story Continues [0:02:27]
Rhi: So we see Blaire dragging this rowboat up onto the shore of the river opposite Duskwall, the lightning barrier crackling overhead. She hoists her pack up on her shoulders and walks into the small river cave, and we follow her into the darkness. I think she has to very quickly turn on an electroplasm lantern. It fills the whole space with an eerie blue glow. It’s not a terribly deep cave, but it does have a little bit of a bend in it, and so she comes around the bend.
The whole cave is damp. There’s a thin layer of water on the ground. There’s water dripping from the ceiling and down the walls. Setarra is standing in the middle of this cavern that has been prepared for this summoning ritual, and she looks very at home here. She looks more energetic than I think Blaire has seen her possibly ever.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Setarra tends to be more of a, like… well, with the exception of when she’s been fighting people. [chuckles]
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Most of the time she’s more of kind of a still pool of water than anything. She has laid out stones that have runes carved on them on the floor so the runes are just above the surface of the water. She’s holding the summoning book in her hands and is kind of pacing back and forth, flipping through things, muttering to herself. She looks up and gives a shark-tooth smile when Blaire comes in.
Rhi (as Setarra): You have it?
Kim (as Blaire): I do.
Rhi: Looks at you expectantly.
Kim: Blaire reaches into her bag and pulls out the artifact that she retrieved from the Archive of Echoes.
Rhi: Setarra closes the book and tucks it under her arm and then will take this box very carefully in both hands and opens it up, and just kind of looks at this vial of ichor for a little bit, picks it up and holds it up to the light.
Rhi (as Setarra): I have existed for longer than any mortals could ever care to count, and I have never seen anything like this.
Kim (as Blaire): You mean it?
Rhi (as Setarra): You have done very well, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): [exhales in delighted relief] Thank you.
Rhi: And she kind of is like, you know, she gives you some instructions for finishing setting up the ritual. You’re familiar with sort of what it involves. She takes that vial, and while Blaire is doing these preparations—Blaire doesn’t see this, but we as the audience see—Setarra slides her hand into her dress of water and pulls out a second vial. It is a vial of Spiritsight, the drug that the Circle of Flame was using to force people to have occult visions to learn the locations of the Relics of Kotar that ended up killing them after being overdosed on it, and Blaire gave Setarra a vial of this quite some time ago. So, she has both vials in her hands and kind of is… I think we cut back to Blaire as Blaire is finishing up, and it’s clear that Setarra is doing something with them in her hands, we don’t really know what, but then she turns back around and just has the one ichor vial.
I think one of the things that Blaire had provided was a bowl of some kind for the center of the summoning. Setarra will kind of take her place on one side of this summoning circle, Blaire takes her place on the other side, and I think that Blaire reaches into the ghost field, and I think that lines of energy begin to form between these rune stones on the ground, sort of forming a barrier around this space, and before they’re finished Setarra steps forward and opens the vial and pours this extradimensional ichor into this bowl, and then she quickly steps back and the last line of this barrier closes, and there’s just this glowing barricade that Setarra and Blaire are outside of.
As the chanting continues, it’s a little hard for Blaire to wrap her head around what she’s seeing. Blaire has seen a lot of very weird stuff in her life. She sought a lot of it out. A hole in reality is a little tough to grapple with mentally. You can understand a hole in a wall or a hole in the ground, but this is, you just understand instinctively, this is a hole in your dimension.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: You don’t entirely see the thing come through. You see this hole, and then you blink, and then there is something inside the barricade. It is pretty large. It has a lot of limbs and tendrils. It has spines. It has a lot of eyes. You can’t really… you can sort of only process it in pieces. If you try to take it in as a whole your brain starts to hurt in very bad ways, and your mind will not allow you to fully process what you’re looking at, to protect yourself.
Kim: Right. Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It’s within this barricade, and it is thrashing, not making any sound, at least no sound that you can hear. The chanting, I think both of you kind of conclude, it comes to sort of an abrupt stop, and this thing is here, inside this barricade, and I think Setarra just kind of is standing there staring at it. How does Blaire react?
Kim (as Blaire): What is that?
Rhi (as Setarra): I have no idea.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t know?!
Rhi (as Setarra): You never know what you’re going to get with these sorts of things.
Kim (as Blaire): [weakly] But…
Rhi (as Setarra): But it is perfect.
Kim (as Blaire): Perfect for what?
Rhi: She smiles at you again, that big shark-tooth grin, and for the first time, I think, Blaire sees it as the predatory expression that it is, and she reaches out a hand, and the water in this cave rushes forward suddenly knocking all of the rune stones askew and shattering the barrier. The creature doesn’t seem to realize that it’s free immediately, but when it does it doesn’t charge at you, it doesn’t charge at Setarra, it just goes up through the roof of the cave, almost as if it phased into the ghost field, and then it’s gone, and Setarra starts to laugh this wild, maniacal, triumphant laugh.
Kim (as Blaire): [fiercely] What did you do?! Why did you do that?! We have to study it! You can’t just let it out if we don’t know what it is!
Rhi (as Setarra): [laughs] Oh, you have no idea what I’ve been doing, child. You have no idea what I am.
Kim (as Blaire): Setarra, what are you talking about?
Rhi (as Setarra): I am the waves that break masts and sink ships. I am the merciless tides that drag the drowning from any who would save them. I am the freezing inky depths that hide monsters greater than anything you can fathom. I am the suffering of the sea, and you will not cross me.
Rhi: And it is in this moment that Setarra’s human Tycherosi disguise washes away like a wave coming off the beach. So Kim, tell me what Setarra the Sea Demon looks like.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim: [gasps, smiling] You’re gonna let me describe her?
Rhi: Yep.
Kim: Yes! [claps] Ooh… Ooh, what do I choose? Oh wait, wait-wait-wait, I know. I know, I know, hang on. Uh… Have y’all ever seen a frilled shark?
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Describe it for our audience in case they have not.
Kim: So, Setarra’s… Question for Rhi. Is this like the closest equivalent to a demon form she can get into this realm or do you think this is like her full true form?
Rhi: Yeah, so demons are of this realm.
Kim: Oh right.
Rhi: They’re just kind of like elemental entities, so yeah, this is… yeah, this is whatever she’s gonna look like. This is her true form.
Kim: Okay. So Setarra’s true demonic form I think resembles somewhat… I would describe it as a frilled shark with a bit of a Bloodborn twist.
Josie: Yes~
Kim: Yeah. So, frilled sharks are just very eel-like, and they’re named for these frilled gills, and they have these very… How would you describe those eyes? It’s like refracted I guess.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: It’s that same kind of look that you get when you see cat eyes in a certain light. You know, it just has that weird eerie glow to it, very dark. It is ginormous, and there is just so many spindly limbs. Actually, instead of the teeth that a frilled shark has, I think… Let me see. It probably has the teeth of a dragonfish which are just these very needle-like rows and rows of teeth.
Minna: Ooh.
Rhi: Ooh, cool.
Kim: And you know what, actually… Do we wanna do bioluminescent shit, or is that too much?
Josie: Hell yes.
Rhi: Go for it.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: No, there is no upper limit. Make it as fucking weird as you can.
Kim: Great. In that case, there are small pinprick dots of bioluminescence that go along both sides of the entire form. A mix between a dragonfish and a frilled shark, and if Bloodborn got a hand in that.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: That’s the closest thing to what I would describe this as.
Rhi: I have one final question.
Kim: Oh! Oh! Hang on, I thought of one more thing.
Rhi: Yeah. Yes, yes!
Kim: You know what, I’m gonna go with it. Have y’all ever seen hagfish slime?
[interested and uneasy noises]
Rhi: Ohh, yeah.
Kim: Yeah. She’s just covered in hagfish slime. It’s just like, pouring, it’s like… not pouring, it’s…
Rhi: It’s this thick…
Kim: Yep, thick gooey, viscous…
Rhi: …like white-gray viscous slime. It’s nasty.
Josie: Ew.
Kim: Yep, and it’s just dripping from her jaws, and it’s all over her body.
Minna: [startled] Oh… What?
Rhi: I have one final question for you about this form.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Is it humanoid or—I’m kind of picturing like you said an eel-like shark. I’m picturing that she’s just coiled like a giant snake.
Kim: Yes. Yeah, no, there’s absolutely nothing human about this at all.
Rhi: Excellent. So… this happens. Setarra’s true form is revealed. How does Blaire react to seeing Setarra’s form?
Kim: Blaire is just barely holding it together. She’s very visibly shaken, but she’s still standing her ground and staring at Setarra, and I think she’s just looking at her pleadingly.
Kim (as Blaire): Setarra, I don’t like this. Whatever’s going on, this needs to stop.
Rhi (as Setarra): [slow and deliberate] I don’t care what you like or what you want. You have served your purpose and are no longer of use to me.
Kim (as Blaire): [upset, confused, stammering] What do you—What?! No, you said—!
Rhi: And again, she waves her hand…
Josie: Does she have hands right now?
Rhi: Oh, that’s true. You’re right. She I think just sort of makes this gesture with her head.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: And the waters in the cave rise again, rapidly, and just sweep Blaire out of the cave and out into the river. I think that what we see next is Blaire dragging herself, soaked to the skin, face makeup is completely smudged, hair is plastered to her head, dragging herself out of the river on the Duskwall side. I think that as you look around, Blaire, you catch a glimpse out of the corner of your eye of a large many-limbed shape sort of clambering through a building several blocks north of you.
Kim: I know we’re pressed for time—in character we’re pressed for time—but… [sighs] I think Blaire’s just gonna drop to her knees and break down. She’s just gonna cry.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: That’s fair. Blaire has just had her entire world view forcibly crushed.
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: So Blaire is on her knees, on the edge of the river, sobbing, and we cut over to The Nest. I think first we see Hex curled up in a little ball sleeping in front of the fireplace. Where do we find Kevin, and what is Kevin adorned with this fine eve?
Josie: Kevin… I think Kevin is wearing a black shawl. It’s one of Minx’s goth clothes.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I think Minx is on the sofa or whatever near Jinx, although she has learned not to try and pet him in this state, sipping tea and reading one of her romance novels.
Rhi: [smiling] Excellent. What’s Myra up to?
Minna: I think she’s just kinda like going through her notes again. She found what she needed, but she’s definitely like, you know that point where you’ve got all your research but you need to bring it together to make it make sense to you? She’s been in that zone.
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, so going through your notes on hulls. Yeah, so it’s this nice quiet domestic scene, and I think Hex reacts first. Almost before the two of you can hear footsteps on the stairs Hex sits up and does that very alert cat thing and then just runs upstairs.
Minna: Aw.
Josie (as Minx): Hmm?
Rhi: And then a few seconds later the door bursts open and a drenched to the skin, just absolute mess, Blaire comes staggering in.
Kim: And she just looks absolutely haunted, like her eyes are wide, she’s trembling, not only because she’s cold but she is just in shock. She is just staring out into space not making eye contact with any of you. She looks completely in a daze.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire? Dear? … Okay, um…
Josie: Minx will slowly approach and try and guide Blaire to the table and try and get her some tea.
Kim: Yeah, she lets you. She’s still not completely there, but she lets you.
Josie: Yeah. I don’t think Minx is gonna say anything more until Blaire has tea in her hands.
Kim: Mm.
Rhi: What does Myra do?
Minna: I think she’s obviously—She’s gotten up from the desk and she’s waiting to hear what Blaire has to say. She doesn’t want to add more pressure, but very clearly stressed out about this.
Rhi: Yeah, so I think that you can get a mug of tea into Blaire’s hands, maybe get her a blanket, and yeah, it’s kinda whenever Blaire starts talking, however long that takes.
Kim: It’s probably not too-too long after, you know, she’s taken care of, but maybe like three minutes before she says anything. She just lowers the tea from her mouth.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s all my fault.
Josie (as Minx): What happened?
Kim (as Blaire): She made me do it, but it’s all my fault. It’s all my fault.
Minna (as Myra): Who made you do what, Blaire?
Kim (as Blaire): Setarra’s done something really bad, and I don’t… I don’t know. I don’t know how bad it is, but it’s bad.
Josie: Minx kind of gives Myra a look, like saw that coming, but doesn’t say that out loud.
Kim (as Blaire): [tearful] She used me.
Josie: Minx is gonna rest a hand on Blaire’s forearm.
Josie (as Minx): What did she make you do?
Kim (as Blaire): We brought something here, and I don’t know what it is.
Josie (as Minx): Is it like that time in the bank?
Kim: Blaire’s just gonna start crying again. She’s gonna bring a hand to her eyes, and she just starts sobbing.
Minna (as Myra): How bad is it?
Kim (as Blaire): It’s bad. It’s bad. I… I don’t know what it’s going to do, but I felt it. It’s bad.
Rhi: I think there’s a moment of quiet, aside from Blaire weeping, and it’s in that quiet that you all start to hear the screaming from outside. It is distant, and it’s not like a whole crowd of people screaming, you just kind of hear one piercing blood-curdling scream, and then another one, and then another one, all coming from the northern end of the district.
Josie (as Minx): We have to stop it.
Kim (as Blaire): H-How? How Minx?!
Josie (as Minx): It came from somewhere. We can send it back, right? Like the lobster.
Kim (as Blaire): [tearful] I don’t know. I don’t know… I don’t know, we only– [sniffs] We only ever looked into how to bring it here. I don’t know how to put it back.
Josie (as Minx): [deliberately calm] We can figure it out, Blaire, and we don’t need to act alone in this, but we do need to go now.
Kim (as Blaire): Now?
Josie: Minx nods.
Minna (as Myra): Now.
Josie (as Minx): We’re going to help you.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Josie: Minx said now, but she does go to her room for a second. [laughs]
Rhi: Yes. Yeah, you can. So basically this is the start of the score. You can gear up. If Blaire wants to change out of her dripping wet clothes she can.
Kim: Yeah. [laughs] That’d be nice.
Rhi: Yeah. So yeah, this is going into the score. I will tell you, it’s an Occult score. [chuckles]
Josie: [smiling] Okay then.
Rhi: There also is not gonna be an engagement roll.
Kim: Oh.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Because this is just—this is gonna be fucking weird. [laughs]
Josie: Yep. Minx is going with a heavy load.
Minna: Same.
Kim: I’m also doing heavy.
Rhi: Okay, makes sense. [laughs] Makes a lot of sense.
Josie: And I think Minx emerges from her bedroom saying:
Josie (as Minx): I was saving this for a certain undeath-inclined friend, but…
Josie: She comes out in a full-length black trench coat with lots of various paraphernalia strapped across her chest.
Rhi: [laughs] Yes!
Josie: It specifically includes a bag of rice and wooden stakes.
Minna: [smiling] Minx the—
Josie: [laughs] And her new demon bane charm. She’s basically sexy Van Helsing.
Kim: Oh my God, yes!
Minna: I was gonna say, Minx the vampire slayer. [giggles] I love it.
Rhi: That’s right. Thank you for reminding me about that demon bane charm.
Josie: Yes.
Minna: Amazing.
Rhi: I forgot about that. yeah, that will come in important. So yeah, the three of you run down into the streets and I assume start heading towards the screaming?
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: The thing that you notice and that you can kind of take some solace in is you’re hearing a lot of screaming but you’re not hearing the death bell.
Kim: Oh…
Josie: [pinched] That’s good?
Rhi: Yeah, so whatever is happening it doesn’t seem to be killing people.
Kim: Or it doesn’t seem to be killing people in a way that this world understands or recognizes.
Rhi: A fair point!
[laughter]
Minna: Oh, I wish you hadn’t said that.
Kim: You know, but that’s the first thing my brain went to, is just like oh that’s bad.
Rhi: Yeah, you don’t hear the death bell, but you do hear screaming, like terrified screaming, and you start heading north up through the district. As you go you start seeing things, weird things. You come around a corner and you see a horse in full cavalry barding come charging out of a building.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: Hooves clattering, it throws its head back and whinnies, and then it just charges into the building across the street and disappears.
Josie (as Minx): Um… I’m gonna go ahead and chalk that up to whatever this thing is.
Rhi: You keep going, and you see glimpses of people just sort of… they’re not real people, because they are floating ten feet in the air or walking through walls.
Minna: Hmm!
Rhi: It looks like… You all wouldn’t understand it as being a film rewound, but it looks like that where they’re just walking and moving perfectly in reverse.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: You see animals that you’ve never seen before that don’t make any sense.
Kim: [whispering] Yo~
Rhi: These strange creatures from distant lands that maybe you’ve only read about.
Kim: Probably pre-cataclysmic animals, too, I would imagine.
Rhi: At one point what looks like a Dagger Isles privateer ship just comes crashing down the street, and it is coming towards the three of you, and I think just on instinct you all dive out of the way… and then it’s gone.
Josie: Minx, when she left The Nest, was trying to be grimly determined and heroic. Now she’s just like…
Josie (as Minx): WHAT?!
Josie: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Real quick question, Blaire. Did you know it could do things like this?
Kim (as Blaire): No, I didn’t.
Minna (as Myra): This feels bigger than an entity. This feels like something is broken?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah… Yeah, this is, um… [squirms] I could tell you this much. This much I know.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm?
Kim (as Blaire): Whatever we brought it broke reality. I felt it when we brought it here.
Josie (as Minx): Oh good.
Minna (as Myra): Ugh… Yeah, and we can see it now.
Josie (as Minx): I hope reality can be put together like a vase with some glue or the like.
Kim (as Blaire): That would be nice.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t think reality is like a vase.
Kim (as Blaire): Reality is like… paper?
Josie (as Minx): The good news is none of this seems actively hostile. Maybe, perhaps like the lobster it can be reasoned with?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know if I can reason with something this big, but you’re right it’s not hostile, it’s just confused.
Minna (as Myra): Maybe it could use a tour guide.
Josie (as Minx): Yes, or at the very least treat it vaguely like a confused animal?
Kim (as Blaire): [sighs] I mean, what else can we do?
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps we can just try and direct it somewhere?
Rhi: You hear gunshots, and you’re not sure if they’re real or not, coming from somewhere up the street.
Kim: Blaire follows them.
Minna: Yeah, we run that way.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: All right. As you run that way, all three of you, your visions all kind of go this silvery white, and Minx, when your vision clears you are standing on the deck of a ship, not one of the leviathan hunters but an old wooden sailing ship. You are out on the high seas, the sails are furled, the ship is dashing through the waves, and… what is Minx wearing?
Josie: I think it’s the most stereotypical fucking red boisterous pirate captain outfit you can imagine.
Kim: Captain Morgan?
Josie: Yes.
Minna: [laughs]
Josie: It’s a fucking… [laughs] But you know, like underneath there’s a deep V so she can be all sexy about it, and no peg leg.
Rhi: Yeah, the deepest of Vs.
Josie: And I think there is a colorful parrot flying about her.
Rhi: Yes. Yes. Just as a note, this is from Josie, the soundtrack for this entire sequence is the Pirates of the Caribbean theme.
Kim: Yes!
Josie: Yes.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: So just have that in mind.
[laughter and some humming of the theme]
Rhi: Yep! Minx looks every inch the dashing pirate captain, but she is not the captain of the ship. The captain who has just stepped out from behind the helm, drawing a blade of her own, is clad in… we’re gonna go with just form-fitting black.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: With an embroidered black coat that flairs out and a jaunty hat with a big feather that she takes off and hands off to her first mate. What cool name? Does Minx still go by Minx or does she have some kind of more badass name that she’s known as?
Josie: She absolutely has one of those. I forgot to think of one.
[laughter]
Kim: Whatever it was the surname has to be Swan.
Josie: There we go, the Charlotte Swan.
Rhi: Oh! That’s very good.
Minna: I have to point out that her name is Elizabeth, isn’t it?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: It is!
Minna: OHH! Great!
[giggling]
Rhi: So the captain, as she is strolling down the stairs, says:
Rhi (as captain): The Scarlet Swan, I should have known you wouldn’t give up or that those chains wouldn’t hold you, but you’re too late.
Minna: [giggles uncontrollably]
Josie (as Minx): Did you honestly think I would miss this?
[laughter]
Josie: Then Minx sort of brandishes a rapier and gets into a stance.
Rhi: Yeah, and she brandishes her sword back, and roll Skirmish to tell me how this engagement begins.
[laughter]
Josie: Critical.
Rhi: Are you kidding? Oh my God.
Kim: It’s her fantasy, Rhi!
Rhi: I know, but like the fact that even the dice are just… So, um, yeah. Josie, take it away. You just paint this scene.
Minna: [continues laughing uncontrollably]
Josie: Like, I think this is… Panning out, it’s sort of like the two crews are fighting, and it kind of starts with them testing each other, crossing blades and moving through the various skirmishes, eventually climbing up the rigging and some acrobatics onto the cross mast or whatever, the horizontal part of the mast.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: And as soon as it is up there it is just the most homoerotic thing you’ve ever seen.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Like, they’re getting really close, they’re quipping at each other constantly, and they’re both smiling the whole dang time. [laughs]
Rhi: Yes. There is indeed definitely a point where somebody’s back is against the mast, and you have the swords crossed right at the neck, and your faces are about three inches apart, and it’s just that very intense stare-down.
Josie: I think Minx is the one who ends up pinned, but she’s also the one who kisses first, because she knows she’s not gonna be expecting that.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. It does indeed throw her off balance. I think the fight continues back down the rigging onto the deck, and Minx with a great flourish disarms her opponent who watches her sword go flying off into the sea. Also by this point both of them have removed their coats…
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: …and shirts have taken some sexy cuts in appropriate places.
Josie: [smirking] Mm-hmm.
Rhi: [laughs] So she watches her sword go flying into the sea and looks back to Minx.
Rhi (as captain): Very well, Scarlet, you win this round, but Nyryx will be mine one day.
Minna: Ah! [laughs]
Rhi: And then she just dives off into a waiting life raft, and Minx, you run to the door behind her which is the captain’s quarters that you just know instinctively, and the door is locked, so you will need to deal with that in some way.
Josie: I think she does a fucking Zorro sword maneuver that somehow removes the lock. [laughs]
Kim: Yes~!
Rhi: Yeah. Roll me something for that, whatever you wanna…
Josie: Skirmish.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Six, okay, so [sword slash noises], the door just sorta creeks inward, and you see seated on the window seat, those windows that look out the back of the ship, hair down around her shoulders, wearing this beautiful blue and white gown, is Nyryx who stands up when she sees you.
Rhi (as Nyryx): Oh! Ellie darling, I always knew you would come!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: And throws herself into your arms.
Josie (as Minx): Nyrie my love!
Josie: The music changes to a sappy ass violin track. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, the violins swell. I’m picturing that this is a passionate kiss with a dip.
Josie: Uh-huh, definitely.
Rhi: And then I think you come out of the kiss and are still kind of holding her, leaning down, and Nyryx reaches up and puts a hand on your face.
Rhi (as Nyryx): I think there’s something else you’re supposed to be doing, love.
Josie: Minx kind of squints and shakes her head a little bit like she’s waking up from something.
Josie (as Minx): Perhaps you’re right, dear. I think we need to set a new course.
Rhi: And your vision goes to that silver-white again. We are back in Duskwall walking down a dark damp street. It rained earlier in the evening so there’s the streetlamps glinting off the puddles and the damp cobblestones. The goats pulling carriages along. Duskwall is always a dark city, but somehow it seems darker now. The shadows seem deeper. The people walking the streets seem colder, sharper somehow, it’s hard to explain.
We see a fine townhome in Charterhall, it looks like there’s some kind of gathering happening inside, and on the street we see Minx who I think looks more or less like her normal self. Clave is there, and standing between the two of them is Myra. Minna, if Myra never left Salia, what does she look like?
Minna: I think largely the difference is in terms of what she can afford to wear and attitude, because I think Myra always, in any universe, has fairly stayed tastes, but I think she’s dressed much more nicely especially since this seems to be an occasion than I think we usually see this world’s Myra dress. But I think the real difference is that there is something hard and cold behind her eyes that we haven’t seen from her probably at all in the course of the show.
Rhi: Clave is looking up at the townhouse and says:
Rhi (as Clave): I still don’t see why you had to bring in outside help. We could have handled this.
Minna (as Myra): Perhaps, or you could have offended somebody. She has the most silver tongue in the city.
Josie: Dream Minx winks.
Rhi: [giggles]
Rhi (as Clave): [sighs] Fine. You two go in, work the crowd, find the target. I’ll be covering the exits. Get this done fast. She’s not going to approve if you botch this one.
Minna (as Myra): I won’t be the one to botch it, Clave.
Rhi: She just kind of gives you a silent sneer and strides off. So, the two of you walk up to the front door, present your invitations, and are ushered inside. It’s a party of some kind. There’s important rich people here. The details don’t really matter. What does matter is Myra has a letter that she was given by Salia that she was told not to open until she had arrived at the party, and it has further information about her mission here. So now that you are here, where do you go to open this?
Minna: I think she does a few greetings and then she goes off to find the powder room. [chuckles]
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Minna: And I think once she’s in privacy she opens it, and she’s hissing under her breath, like:
Minna (as Myra): I wish she wouldn’t do this to me.
Rhi: It’s very straightforward as all of Salia’s instructions always are. Your mission here is to eliminate a target, and the target’s name is Jeren Clermont.
Minna: [breathy] No…! [seethes] Shit… Sorry. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: In this universe did they still make friends and is he still her secret informant?
Rhi: It’s up to you.
Minna: Yes, because that would not have changed, because that was before she left Salia.
Rhi: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Minna: Hey, audience, I don’t know if you know this, but when Myra worked with Salia she was sent on a mission to Doskvol Academy and kind of pretended to be a student to try and get in with Jeren and get information about his father’s cases. Didn’t work out that way, and Salia was real mad, but Myra made a friend and a secret informant that she has not told Salia about. So I think her face just, like, all the blood leaves it.
Rhi: And… what do you do?
Minna: Aaah! Sorry, that’s Minna screaming.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yep.
Minna: Uh… of course she hasn’t told her why, because she never does. It doesn’t matter what Myra thinks about why or how.
Rhi: No.
Minna: Can she find Jeren in the crowd?
Rhi: You and Minx, if you want to tell Minx what’s going on—
Minna: I don’t know that Myra trusts Minx like that.
Rhi: Yeah, no, that’s fair.
Minna: Because I’m assuming this is not a universe where they…
Rhi: No. This is you have hired Minx to help you on a job.
Minna: Yeah. So I think she goes and scans the crowd for Jeren.
Rhi: Okay. Minx actually probably got you the invites, in the backstory of this dream.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, give me a roll.
Minna: I guess this is a Consort.
Rhi: Well, you’re scanning a crowd.
Minna: Oh, I’m Surveying, that’s right.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I did not put another point in Survey.
Rhi: Also, Josie, you can feel free to have Minx jump in and do stuff.
Josie: I know. I feel like we know how Minx acts at a party at this point.
Rhi: Yeah. Minx is doing her thing?
Josie: Yeah, and it’s decidedly like a Season 1 Minx approach to it. Very hedonism focused.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Ooh, that’s a tasty 3.
Kim: Delicious.
Josie: Yum.
Rhi: So, you… I think you do see Jeren, and he spots you, and smiles real big and waves you over to come join him. What was the fake name that you used with him?
Minna: Lizete Booker.
Rhi: Lizete Booker. He waves you over.
Rhi (as Jeren): Lizete! I had no idea you were gonna be here tonight. Oh, it’s so good to see you. Let me introduce you to some of my friends from the precinct.
Minna (as Myra): Hello. Wonderful to meet you.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re now standing here in a crowd of Bluecoats.
Minna: I think eventually she’s gonna tug on Jeren’s sleeve, because I imagine they’re standing fairly close and being genial, and out of the corner of her mouth:
Minna (as Myra): I need to see you alone.
Rhi: Roll me something to persuade him of this.
Minna: That is a 6.
Rhi: Okay. He notices that you look a little worried, and he’ll nod and be like “all right,” and will tell his friends that he’ll be back in a moment and will follow you away. Where do you go?
Minna: This is going to be very weird for both of them, but she is going to tuck her hand into his elbow and pretend to giggle as they leave the room, solely just to give them an excuse to be leaving.
Rhi: He looks very confused.
Minna: Then I think just opens the first door to a semi-private looking room that she can find. Like, literally just opens doors until she finds a place and then shoves in.
Rhi: Uh, it’s a dream, the first door that you find is the place you want to be.
Minna: Yeah, it’s like a study, and she shoves a chair under the door handle.
Rhi (as Jeren): Uh…
Minna (as Myra): How fast can you fake your death?
Kim & Josie: [laughs quietly]
Rhi (as Jeren): What? What are you talking about?
Minna (as Myra): Somebody very powerful wants you dead, tonight preferably.
Rhi (as Jeren): What?! What are you talking about?
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know who you pissed off, I don’t know why this is happening, but somebody wants you dead, and unless I make it look like you’re dead tonight we’re both going to be dead in a much messier way. So, how quickly? Do you have any way to do this? Do you have a place you can go to lay low?
Rhi (as Jeren): I… No!
Josie: I like how this version of Myra assumes that people have contingency plans for faking their death.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: [giggles] Yeah.
Minna: Listen! [laughs] Jeren might not be the type, but his dad totally is.
Rhi (as Jeren): No, I don’t have a place to go to…
Minna (as Myra): So ask your father for something, because this is literally life and death.
Rhi (as Jeren): He’s out of town. He’s traveling to Imperial City for the next month.
Minna (as Myra): Of course he is! All right, I know a place, but I don’t know how to make it look good. I didn’t have time to plan this.
Rhi (as Jeren): Okay… I think there must be some kind of mistake here. I’m gonna go back—
Minna (as Myra): No!
Rhi (as Jeren): [stumbles] Maybe I should see you home? Did you have too much to drink? You haven’t been here that long.
Minna (as Myra): I really wish that you would listen to me, but of course this is out of the blue for you. Hi, my name isn’t Lizete Booker, and I’ve been sent to kill you, apparently. How’s that? Try that on for size.
Rhi (as Jeren): What…? What? Oh, you’re… Oh gods, you’re serious.
Rhi: I think he just kind of sits down on the first sittable piece of furniture he can find.
Minna: [giggling] The chair pushed under the door.
Rhi: Probably, yeah, the chair pushed under the door. He was trying to leave.
Minna: I think she leans forward on the arms of the chair.
Minna (as Myra): This isn’t my usual type of job. The good news is that I don’t have anything prepared for this. The bad news is also that I don’t have anything prepared for this, but we have to get you out of here right now.
Rhi (as Jeren): Uh… okay.
Minna: So I think she’s going to leave some blood in this study, but it’s gonna be her own.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Minna: So she is pulling out a knife and is going to cut herself.
Rhi (as Jeren): Oh, whoa! Okay, I thought—What are you…?
Minna (as Myra): It’s fine. This is just for the look of things.
Rhi (as Jeren): Okay?
Rhi: I think that you can leave some blood splashed around this study without any trouble. You don’t have to make a roll for that.
Minna: Yeah, and she does that and rips off a piece of petticoat and wraps it around her… I think it’s her hand, I don’t know. It’s always hands for drama in movies.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: So she wraps it around her palm and then she grabs Jeren’s elbow, and there’s a window, and she hoists it open and pushes him towards it. I think she leans in real close as he’s about to go out the window and grabs his collar and whispers some directions to him. She’s sending him off to a hideout of hers.
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Minna: Oi… I think this is also Consort. She’s trying to, like… Or maybe Command. I think it’s Command. Four.
Rhi: Okay. He listens to you and nods and jumps down. Are you following him out the window?
Minna: No, I’m staying here.
Rhi: I think that as, like… You stay there for a minute, kind of waiting, and just as you’re about to close the window you hear Clave go:
Rhi (as Clave): Oh, what the hell?!
Minna: Is she in here or out there?
Rhi: No, she’s out there.
Minna: Jumping out the window.
Rhi: Yeah. Myra runs down the side of the house, kind of towards the back alley carriage house area, and Clave is standing there with a gun in her hand aimed at Jeren. Jeren has his hands up, he looks very alarmed, and when Myra comes running up Clave is just like:
Rhi (as Clave): I told her that you couldn’t handle it.
Minna: Myra’s drawing her gun.
Rhi: Okay. Hello.
Minna: Or Myra’s gun is probably already in her hand.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Okay, I think it’ sat that moment that from the house there’s the sound of a very large, very expensive window shattering.
Minna: [long breathy laugh]
Josie: And lots of shouting and some distant music, which I don’t know how distracting it is for the people in this scene.
[laughter]
Rhi: Give me a roll.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: You may not intentionally be distracting people, but it’s happening.
Josie: I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. Clave and Jeren both look towards the sound.
Josie: I think as soon as they look you see fucking pirate Minx running out of the darkness with a sword and pistol, like…
Josie (as Minx): Blast! There you are! I went in through the main window. I wasn’t sure where you were gonna be.
[laughter]
Josie: …and she levels her gun at Clave.
Rhi: Myra, what would you like to do?
Minna: I think she gives Minx a very brief incredulous look because of the costume change, but then she’s like…
Minna (as Myra): On my mark.
Minna: …and then she pulls the trigger.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Both of you give me some kind of roll for that.
Josie: Five.
Minna: Also 5.
Rhi: Five, okay. There’s a flurry of gunshots. Clave falls and Jeren staggers back clutching his bloodied shoulder. He got hit, but he is alive.
Josie (as Minx): Phew, just in time. I take it this… whatever this is has been less pleasant for you so far.
Minna (as Myra): I don’t know what you’re talking about, but you never saw any of this.
Minna: And she points her gun at Minx when she says this.
Josie: Minx sort of bulks and is like:
Josie (as Minx): Oh, um, uh… What to say? You may very well point that at me, but isn’t there something else you should be doing?
Minna (as Myra): [confused] What?
Rhi: Jeren puts his hand on your shoulder, and if you look back at him he has a very serious thoughtful expression and he nods.
Rhi (as Jeren): No, she’s right. There’s something else you do need to be doing. I think you need to go. You should go with her.
Minna: She shakes her head and looks slowly between them.
Minna (as Myra): Oh… Minx?
Josie (as Minx): Yes! Yes, it’s me.
Rhi: And everything goes to that silvery white.
Josie: I would like to point out that whenever Minx moves when she shows up here the music follows her like the Doppler Effect.
[laughter]
Minna: That’s amazing.
Rhi: That’s extremely good and makes me very excited for the next scene. So, the silver-white cloud fades away, and we see a close-up on a shelf of books.
Kim: [quietly excited] Yes!
Rhi: These fine leather-bound tomes with gilt edging and titles that, well, it’s hard to read what the titles are, but they seem very interesting and important. We see a familiar hand reach out and pull one of them down and pan back to see Blaire opening up this book and starting to read, just quiet contentment.
We pull back and we see that Blaire is standing in the middle of a long, long, long row of books, just this long aisle. The shelves themselves are probably 20 feet tall, and the aisles go almost past where you can see. As we kind of continue to pull out you can see the ends of the bookshelves, and there’s just more and more and more shelves just stretching off from left to right, seemingly forever.
What is, you know, what does Blaire look like? How is she dressed? Is she carrying anything with her? What’s sort of going on with her in this space?
Kim: I was going to say I like the idea of her being in a Charhollow uniform, but I think we already established that Charhollow doesn’t have uniforms.
Rhi: This is Blaire’s perfect fantasy, so…
Kim: Hmm.
Minna: What if in her fantasy there are uniforms?
[laughter]
Kim: Yes! Yes, she is wearing a boarding school uniform.
Rhi: Aw. Okay.
Minna: Is this what she pictured in Tycheros when she was applying?
Kim: Yeah, it’s probably… It’s slacks with a sweater vest and a collared shirt. She… Yeah, she’s probably wearing a tie, but it’s kind of in that Avril Lavigne style, like not up to dress code.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, it’s a little loose.
Kim: [laughs] Yeah, it’s a little loose, the pattern of it is a little emo.
Josie: I appreciate that Avril Lavigne was your reference point for that.
[laughter]
Kim: I mean, how could it not be? Yeah, and it’s probably like gray and navy blue, I would think.
Rhi: Okay, yeah, so it just looks like a nice emo take on a prep school uniform.
Kim: Yes, exactly.
Rhi: Yeah, I love it. That’s the most Blaire thing I’ve ever heard in my life.
Kim: God… [laughs]
Rhi: So yeah, Blaire, you’ve been in this library for a long time, and you can stay here for as long as you want, and you can read anything you want, and you can do all the research that has ever interested you, and it’s just… it’s perfect.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: And then you hear the music.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Is it the, um, the opera noise from Inception?
Rhi: [hums the tune] Nope! It’s the Pirates of the Caribbean theme.
Kim: Oh!
Rhi: It’s the Pirates of the Caribbean theme playing muffled in another room, but getting closer.
[laughter]
Josie: I don’t know if there’s a librarian off somewhere, but maybe you hear “shh” and then “I’m sorry, I can’t turn it off.”
[laughter]
Kim: Yeah no, Blaire is definitely poking her head out from an aisle and just goes like:
Kim (as Blaire): SHH!
Rhi: Yeah. So Minx and Myra spot Blaire leaning out from the books, shushing you, and so yeah, the two of you come over, Minx’s soundtrack following her.
Josie (as Minx): Um, hello Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): What are you two doing here?
Josie (as Minx): Well, we came to find you, not to disturb your rest or anything, but we do kind of need to get back home.
Kim (as Blaire): This is an exclusive library. You need to have a very specific pass to get in here. How did you get in here?
Josie (as Minx): I mean, well, one such as I is unhindered by such limitations.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): What?!
Josie (as Minx): Don’t you think, as nice as this is, there’s something else you should be doing?
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know what you’re talking about. Listen, I can’t do this right now, I have a lot of work to do.
Josie (as Minx): That’s true, but I think we need to work together on it.
Minna (as Myra): The homework isn’t real.
Kim (as Blaire): Don’t fuck with me, Myra.
Rhi: Can I have Minx and Myra both make me some kind of rolls here for persuading Blaire?
Josie: I’m gonna roll Consort. I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: I got 5 as my top one.
Rhi: So, I’m gonna kind of give this to you, Kim.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Your friends are trying to persuade you, and they are partially successful or they succeed with a consequence. So I will let you decide how that plays out.
Kim: Hmm. Blaire’s just gonna be like:
Kim (as Blaire): [exhales] Okay, now that you mention it, I don’t really know how I got in here, but… that doesn’t add up Myra, and I don’t know if I’m leaving.
Josie (as Minx): I mean, that is up to you, but we would miss you dearly.
Kim (as Blaire): You could always come back. I wouldn’t be here forever.
Minna (as Myra): Blaire, how did you meet us?
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Minna (as Myra): How did you meet us?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… I don’t know. I can’t remember. I mean, I… I know that—
Minna (as Myra): Where do you live?
Kim (as Blaire): Holy shit, I can’t remember. Um… Uh, it was a room? It was some kind of room.
Josie (as Minx): Well, it was definitely after you left school.
Kim (as Blaire): I left school? No, I’m in school right now.
Minna (as Myra): You’re remembering or imagining that you’re in school.
Kim (as Blaire): What…?
Minna (as Myra): Six Towers is in danger, and we need to go stop it.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean… what’s wrong with Six Towers? It seemed fine when I got here.
Josie (as Minx): Do you remember Setarra?
Kim: I think at that her face just blanches and she drops the books that she’s holding, and then she’s gonna… It all comes back to her, and she’s just gonna nod very solemnly.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah… yeah, I remember.
Josie (as Minx): Then we need to go stop her, okay?
Kim (as Blaire): [upset] Minx, I don’t wanna leave.
Josie (as Minx): I—
Kim (as Blaire): Look at this place!
Josie (as Minx): I know, but…
Minna (as Myra): What do you think happens if you stay?
Kim (as Blaire): Setarra wouldn’t find me here.
Rhi: I think that if you look down at the books that Blaire has dropped they are all about summoning demons.
Kim: [laughs wildly] Even in her fantasy she’s making the same mistakes all over again!
Rhi: They may not have been those books when you were holding them.
Kim: Ohh, I like that.
Josie (as Minx): We’ll protect you.
Kim (as Blaire): You can’t protect me from this. Nothing can.
Josie (as Minx): That’s not true.
Kim (as Blaire): Even if we do put this thing away she’s gonna come after me.
Minna (as Myra): Then we’ll stand with you.
Kim: I think at that Blaire just nods and I think she’s gonna take Myra’s hand.
Minna: I think Myra squeezes it.
Josie: Aw.
Rhi: Does Minx wanna get in on this hand-holding action too?
Josie: Yeah. She’s gonna give them a moment first before joining. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, so the three of you are standing there, hands linked, and I think Minx and Myra, you kind of are expecting that silver-white fog again, and you’re waiting, and… nothing seems to be happening.
Minna (as Myra): Huh… You’re not waking up.
Kim (as Blaire): What…?
Josie (as Minx): Well, perhaps we need to find a way out?
Kim (as Blaire): How do we do that?
Josie (as Minx): Maybe if we get back to my ship…
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie (as Minx): Presumably we got in here somehow. Let’s head back that way.
Rhi: Blaire, you have no idea how you got in here. You don’t remember. You’ve just always been.
Kim: Oh, are we still in the library?
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Um… Hmm.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna take a minute to look around and do a 360.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, this way! It was this way.
Kim: She’s just gonna take off in some random direction. She doesn’t know if it was this way, but she just wants to reassure everybody.
Rhi: Yeah. Can I get either individual rolls or a group roll from all of you to find your way out?
Josie: Okay.
Kim: Do folks want to do a group roll? I’ll take the stress.
Josie: Sure.
Minna: Sure.
Josie: I got a 3.
Minna: I got a 1.
Kim: I got a 2.
Josie: We all failed!
Minna: Hey folks…
Rhi: Yeah, 1, 2, and 3, so…
Kim: So how much stress is that? Is that 2 stress?
Rhi: …3, 3 stress.
Kim: Three stress?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Three stress.
Rhi: Because all three of you failed, yeah.
Kim: Oh hell yeah.
Rhi: You all follow after Blaire, and you’re hurrying through these stacks, and the books, like the shelves around you are changing, they’re different books, but no matter what direction you go it just keeps being this infinite library. It doesn’t seem to have an end.
Josie: Is there like a fiction section and a non-fiction section?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Minx is gonna go to the non-fiction section, as much as that pains her.
Rhi: Uh-huh?
Josie: Is there something about Duskwall? Like, something about Duskwall? A book that’s a history of Duskwall or…?
Rhi: Roll me a check to find something.
Josie: I got a 5.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, you find a very, like… I think it is just called A History of Duskwall. It’s a pretty standard textbook.
Josie: Are there pictures?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Minx pulls it off the shelf.
Josie (as Minx): Ah-ha!
Josie: She will open it to a random page, put it on the ground, and hop onto it.
Kim (as Blaire): What did you do that for?
Rhi: Minx is gone.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh…
Josie: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Minx?
Rhi: You saw Minx open up—What did you open it up to? What was the picture of?
Josie: Then I think it was like Six Towers from a distance. Right? The skyline so you can see the Six Towers?
Rhi: Yeah. Okay, cool, yeah. So, you see Minx open it up, “ha-ha,” sets the book down, and then jumps on it and vanishes from sight.
Kim: Yeah, I think Blaire’s just gonna follow.
Rhi: Okay. Myra?
Minna: Yeah, following.
Rhi: All right. That was such a cool idea that I was like… no, this works, this is good.
Josie: [laughs] I was like, we’re in a big library, I’m gonna Page Master this shit.
Rhi: I was thinking Mist, but… [laughs] Same thing. So, I think again, as each of you jumps into the book, finally that silver-white fog covers your vision, and when it clears the three of you are standing back in Six Towers. You have moved forward about two blocks, and you can see there’s a six-way intersection of streets in front of you, so there’s sort of a big open space where all these streets come together, and in that intersection is this thing. Minx and Myra, because you do not have the Iron Will ability like Blaire does, you are immediately—you’re going to have a reaction of either you’re gonna freeze, run away, or you will need to make a Resolve resistance roll to keep your head.
Minna: Yeah, I’m gonna make that roll.
Josie: Yeah, same.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Five, so I only take 1 stress, right?
Rhi: Yep, and Minx got a critical.
Josie: Yes, but I had no stress, so there’s no additional effect.
Rhi: Okay, so you just, yeah, you don’t take any stress. Okay, so how do both of you keep from, like, how do you both keep yourselves calm in the face of this?
Josie: I don’t think Minx stays calm per se, she’s very clearly put off by it and afraid, but I think it’s like she doesn’t fight it this time and just sort of lets the emotion roll off.
Rhi: Yeah, I like that. How about Myra?
Minna: I think what she does is she looks sideways at the people she came here with and she thinks “we can do this, we have to.”
Rhi: Heh, yeah. So it’s just sort of pacing around it seems like, extending tendrils and spines into buildings, and every so often when it does you just hear some sort of horrible scream or wail.
Josie: I think Minx is gonna slowly gather herself a little bit. She’s missing the pirate outfit that was giving her confidence.
Rhi: You’ve got a cool trench coat and some wooden stakes, though!
Josie: That’s true. I think she’s just gonna clear her throat like she’s trying to get someone’s attention.
Rhi: Um… make a roll. It’s gonna be, uh… risky for reduced effect.
Josie: That’s fine. I’m gonna be rolling Consort here. I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay. You do it but you’re still at reduced effect. It’s hard to say if it looks at you, because again, similarly to how Blaire was when she first saw this thing your brain is kinda not allowing you to fully process this thing, but you sense that you have gotten its attention and that is kind of confirmed when it extends some of its spines towards you. They don’t touch, it’s just kind of reaching out.
Josie: Minx kind of lightly winces, like she closes one of her eyes, but she tries not to pull back too much.
Rhi: Yeah. Myra? Blaire? What do you wanna do?
Kim: Blaire’s gonna reach out to it.
Rhi: Okay. Are you gonna touch it?
Kim: Or try to. Yeah. I wanna have a How to Train Your Dragon moment with this thing.
Minna: [heavy exhale]
Josie: Aw.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: You reach out and touch this thing, and it doesn’t really have, like, you can tell that you’re interacting with it, your hand feels weird, I think kind of a pins and needles sort of feeling…
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: …and I need you to roll Resolve resistance to avoid being pulled into another dream.
Kim: Oh, shoot, you’re right. Resolve you said? Okay, that’s a 6.
Rhi: Okay, so you don’t take any stress and you manage to pull your hand back before it… Your vision kinda starts to go into that silvery white, and you’re like “ooh, nope!”
Kim: Yep.
Rhi: And yeah. Myra, I think you see all this happen. What do you wanna do?
Minna: Oh boy. Well nobody’s tried talking to it yet, have they?
Rhi: No. No. Minx cleared her throat. Blaire tried to touch it.
Minna: Myra steps forward like half a step.
Minna (as Myra): Hello?
Rhi: Roll something.
Minna: Consort?
Rhi: Sure, risky-reduced.
Minna: What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like?
Rhi: I think that you’re gonna have a permanent condition.
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: We’re gonna call it Dream Touched. It’s not like harm, it’s just gonna be something you can put down in the notes where periodically—and I’m gonna need to write this down somewhere so I remember it—but in place of another consequence I am just going to shove you into a dreamscape.
Minna: [smiling] That’s really fucking cool. Yes.
Rhi: Now, you will have the option to do a long-term project to get rid of that if you so choose, but…
Minna: But at the moment I love it. [laughs] Please curse me with this.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s your Bargain.
Minna: That’s a 5.
Rhi: Five, okay, and you’d taken that Bargain to get it up to standard effect?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: So you said hello, and I think, again, you can feel that its attention is on you, and I think when you all had come up into this intersection it was like the size of a house, it was huge, now it’s like the size of a horse or a big goat, like one of the Akorosian goats which are also the size of horses. You didn’t see it shrink, it’s just that’s how big it is now.
Minna: Yeah, dream logic.
Rhi: Yeah, and it kind of crouches, sort of, a little, and sort of fans its spines out towards you, and just seems to be—it’s not making contact, but it is paying attention to you, and it’s very unsettling, and I think that… you got a 5, you said?
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I think you’re gonna just take level 1 harm of Unnerved. It is just… you are disturbed to your core to have this thing focusing on you.
Minna: Mm-hmm. I’m not gonna resist that, because I’m 3 away from a trauma and I’d like to reserve that for a more climactic moment to take a trauma.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] No, that’s fair.
Minna (as Myra): We don’t want to hurt you. We just want to help you get somewhere that is safer for you to be and for everyone else around here for you to be.
Rhi: Okay. It’s still regarding you.
Minna: I think Myra will turn to Blaire.
Minna (as Myra): My friend here is an expert in finding places for supernatural creatures who do not have one.
Kim (as Blaire): We want to bring you home. Let us help you.
Rhi: It’s still looking at the three of you. It has also stopped putting tendrils into buildings. It seems to be just focused on the three of you.
Kim: Oh, okay.
Rhi: So it’s just kind of there, regarding you, still. It seems to be willing to let you, like, do stuff. You’re not sure if it understands what you’re saying, but it’s paying attention to you. That’s kind of as good as it’s gonna get right now with the approach that you’re taking.
Kim: Right.
Josie (as Minx): Blaire, can you, like, do what you did to get it here but perhaps in reverse?
Kim: Uh… Rhi, do you think that’s possible? Because I don’t have the rune stones with me.
Rhi: You can try. You’ve got arcane implements. That gets you chalk. You could draw runes.
Kim: I could.
Rhi: It’s gonna be a question of how well—because Blaire doesn’t have the book anymore.
Kim: Right. How well did she memorize it, yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Um… I mean, I can try.
Josie (as Minx): Please do, or if there’s a way to open a door without pulling another thing through, maybe?
Kim (as Blaire): I’ll do my best.
Rhi: Yeah. So, Blaire, what do you wanna do for that?
Kim: Well, I’m probably gonna have to roll Attune to try and just start the ritual and get set up.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Kim: Okay, that’s a 6 – 6, 2, 4.
Rhi: Damn. Okay, yeah. So Blaire, I think you’ll need to mark arcane implements.
Kim: Yes, agreed.
Rhi: And I think that you, as you pull out some chalk and start drawing runes on the stones, it all kind of starts to come back to you, like all of the reading that you did, all the notes that you took which are now all ruined in the river, but it’s starting to come back. I think as you’re drawing these runes on the stones it’s kind of following you, like curiously.
Kim: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): You stand there. You stand over there. These are the words we’re gonna say. Okay?
Josie (as Minx): All right.
Minna (as Myra): Okay.
Kim: Then she just tells them what they’re going to chant.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: I don’t wanna step on any toes, but I feel like this might be a group Attune just to do this ritual successfully.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Makes sense.
Kim: Okay. I can lead it. I don’t care.
Rhi: It’s gonna be risky, reduced effect, because Blaire is the only one who actually is familiar with this thing, and yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Can we… How does pushing to increase effect in this case work?
Kim: Would I take the stress?
Rhi: Yeah. I think Blaire, since she’s leading, would need to be the one to take the stress.
Kim: Listen, I’m willing to do it.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Okay.
Kim: Okay, so that’s 1 to, uh, or is it 2?
Rhi: Two stress.
Kim: Woohoo, we’re getting close, baby!
[laughter]
Josie: I got a 2.
Kim: I got a 4, 1, 3.
Minna: I also got a 4.
Rhi: So the result is a 4.
Kim: So how much stress does that…?
Rhi: One.
Kim: I am stressed out. Blaire’s out.
Rhi: Okay.
Josie: Welcome to the two trauma club. [laughs]
Kim: Woohoo! Thank you.
Rhi: Okay. You start chanting, and the creature, the entity, starts getting kind of agitated.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It’s stalking around. It can’t seem to get past the rune stones that you had drawn, and as the chant builds and you’re going through this recitation it’s just getting more and more agitated and lashing out with spines and tendrils. Then, that hole in reality rips open again, and Minx and Myra both have to grapple with that.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Ahh!
[laughter]
Rhi: And when that hole rips open the creature lashes out and several spines strike Blaire. She’s not physically harmed…
Kim: Right.
Rhi: …but she is just knocked into some kind of dreamscape and she just falls. The hole stays there. The creature does not go into the hole, but this massive, like, kind of resembles a bird talon but with a lot of extra toes and claws, massive, comes out of this hole and snatches this thing and grabs it and just yanks it away.
[impressed and uneasy noises]
Kim: There is always a bigger fish.
[laughter]
Rhi: Minx and Myra, here’s the problem. The hole isn’t closing.
Minna: [pinched] Mm-hmm!
Rhi: And this clawed thing that came out and grabbed it was like blacker than black, blacker than the Void Sea. You can’t see what’s on the other side of this hole, but you know that it’s there and you can tell that it is trying to come through.
Minna: Oh no.
Rhi: So Minx and Myra, Blaire is unconscious and something very, very large is trying to come through a hole in reality into your city. What would you like to do?
Kim: [smiling] I’m sorry I left you like this, but I wanted to take a trauma this episode.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: I think Minx not being especially familiar with the occult and probably not knowing that the runes on the ground are likely a binding thing…
Kim: Oh no.
Minna: [gasps]
Josie: …Minx is probably gonna move to destroy the circle thinking that will close it.
Kim: I don’t know…
Rhi: It could work. Anything could work. So Minx—
Kim: And we can always resist consequences.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yes. Minx, if you would like to do that, make some kind of roll.
Josie: She’s gonna Wreck it.
Rhi: Okay. Desperate. [laughs]
Josie: Uh-huh?
Rhi: I think standard effect. There’s nothing really interfering with your ability to break up the chalk sigils on the ground, it’s just you are so out of your depth here.
Josie: Yeah. I think I’m gonna push myself for increase die.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Get up to 3d6 here.
Rhi: [pained] Ohh…
Josie: [forced sarcastic laughter]
Kim: Ooh, no… no-no no-no.
Josie: That’s a 3.
Rhi: That is a 3.
Kim: [hums gameshow failure stinger]
Rhi: [reluctant] The hole gets bigger.
Josie: Uh-oh!
Minna: [nervous trilling]
Rhi: And something is starting to come through. I’m gonna start a clock.
Josie (as Minx): [frantically] Uh, Myra, help?
Rhi: [smiling] The clock is called Something is Coming Through, 1 out of 3.
Minna: Yeah, I’m terrified. Out of character, I don’t actually know how this works. I have no idea what’s going on. I have no idea how Myra would be equipped to deal with this.
Rhi: I mean, as Minx pointed out earlier this episode, Blaire did accidentally do a summon when you all broke into that bank, and that thing did seem to just kind of disappear on its own after a while, like you didn’t hear about it rampaging through the city, so… I think that’s what you might have gleamed from that and maybe from talking to Blaire about it a little bit, things from elsewhere can’t survive here for very long. Now, depending on what they are, they might not need to survive for very long to do a lot of damage, but…
Minna: Yeah, I’m not sacrificing…
Rhi: …this thing isn’t—it’s not meant to be here, this is not its place. I think that’s what Myra knows.
Minna: Then I’m not sacrificing Six Towers to Godzilla even if it’s only one-hour Godzilla.
Josie: [uneasy] Yeah. By the way, what is taking so long for like the Spirit Wardens or something to show up?
Minna: Can I attune to the ghost field and see if I can do something about this?
Rhi: Yeah, so I can… [chuckles] Out of character, Josie, the closer you get to this thing the more you get caught in a dreamscape, so they probably are trying, but they can’t wake up.
Josie: Ah, I see. Mm-hmm.
Rhi: [laughs] Myra.
Minna: What would my position and effect be?
Rhi: If you…?
Minna: Attune to the ghost field. I want to see if I can physically try to stitch this wound in the universe back together, even if it’s starting with a single stitch.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s gonna still be desperate, I think.
Minna: The effect is rather important.
Rhi: Yeah… I will allow you to grab Blaire’s fine spirit mask from her person, with Kim’s permission.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah. Totally. Do what you have to do.
Rhi: That will give you—if you use that, that will give you standard effect.
Minna: So it would be reduced effect because I’m Unnerved. I’m gonna push myself?
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: [relieved] Hell yes. I got a 6.
Rhi: Okay! Tell me what this looks like.
Minna: I think… Oh, you know what? You know what she does? So, we haven’t brought it out in a while, but Myra, she has this thing called Ghost Contract where she has a rune on her that she can shake somebody’s hand and a rune will appear on both their hands that binds them to the promise or they’re cursed if they break it.
Kim: Oh, that’s right.
Rhi: Yeah?
Minna: So she has this rune that means binding, basically, and I think she’s gonna take it and twist it and start sort of doing a chain of these runes along the edges of this wound in reality, like trying to bind it back together.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Like this is just a moment of desperate, you know, necessity is the mother of invention, and like, I don’t know if this is gonna work but I’m gonna try it because it’s what I have.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: Yeah. I think it starts working. I think that you can tell that it’s getting there, but it… I feel like, yeah…
Minna: I think it’s like this chain of blood red… like runes written in blood red light, and reality is twisting and churning, and it’s trying to keep it together, but it’s fighting back.
Rhi: Yeah. I think I want one more thing, because Minx does have that demon bane super-powered thing.
Josie: Right, but that’s demon bane.
Rhi: Eh, you know what, it got souped-up. We can have it be working against a lot of things if you want.
Josie: Then that’ll probably be what I try next.
Rhi: Yeah. I think give that a shot.
Josie: Yeah, I think Minx is just starting to cry a little bit that she’s even thinking about doing this. She’s just gonna brandish it out, arm’s length, like a hunter holding a cross, and slowly get closer to it and see if it backs off any.
Rhi: Okay. What are you gonna roll for that?
Josie: I think it’s gonna be Attune.
Rhi: Okay. I will tell you, I can also see an argument for Command if you have better in Command.
Josie: Mm-hmm. Either way, I’m gonna use Rook’s Gambit to use my Sway instead.
Rhi: [laughs] Fair enough.
Josie: Having it be kind of like “the power of Christ compels you!” That sort of thing.
Rhi: Yeah. Go ahead. This is gonna be, because of Myra’s actions, risky-standard.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: Myra’s gotten into a better spot.
Josie: Critical.
Rhi: [relieved] Oh, that’s the best possible outcome.
Josie: Yay~
Rhi: I was so hoping that would happen.
Kim: Minx, you’re a hero!
Josie: I did it~
Rhi: So, Minx and Myra working together, I think that, Minx, this thing starts glowing hot in your hand and you’re just like, “ugh, I gotta keep holding onto this.” Myra, you are forcing—I’m imagining that your hand, the rune on your hand is also glowing really bright. I think Minx is able to kind or repel this thing back just enough for Myra to yank the edges closed, and then there’s a very faint pop sound…
Josie: [relieved sigh]
Rhi: …and then there’s a moment of quiet… and then all of the bells start.
Minna: [gasps, then sighs in relief]
Rhi: Like, all of the alarm bells, the Bluecoats, the Spirit Wardens, the Brigade is here for some reason. They don’t know what’s going on, but they figure they may as well show up. They’re all rushing towards your location, and Blaire is still unconscious on the ground.
Kim: But… Rhi.
Josie: Pick Blaire up and run!
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Rhi?
Rhi: Yeah?
Kim: Are the death bells included in this?
Rhi: No.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: It’s just every security force in the city is currently descending on your location.
Kim: Okay.
Josie: Blaire is now a sack of potatoes and we’re running.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. So the two of you sprint, and Blaire, while you are in this dream…
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Rhi: For a while you were just kind of, like, it was just dark unconsciousness, you’re not really actually aware of anything, but then you come into this dream, and Setarra, as you knew her previously, not her demon form, is…
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: I think that you’re still lying on the ground and she’s just crouched in front of you, her brow furrowed.
Kim: [softly] Mm-hmm.
Rhi (as Setarra): Very impressive, child. I should have killed you when I had the chance.
Josie: [nervous whistling exhale]
Kim: Is Blaire awake?!
Rhi: And then you’re gonna wake up.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): [inhales sharply, sobs]
Rhi: Yeah, I think that you’re all back at The Nest when Blaire bolts awake.
Josie (as Minx): There, good… Good, you’re still here.
Kim (as Blaire): What happened?
Josie (as Minx): Uh… we patched up the hole somehow. You got it back through, but kinda had to shut the door behind it.
Kim (as Blaire): Wha… agh.
Kim: I think Blaire has a headache. A hand just goes to her forehead.
Kim (as Blaire): [groans]
Josie: Minx is gonna make sure Blaire has tea and a blanket.
Kim: Aw.
Josie (as Minx): Phew… Glad that is over.
Minna (as Myra): [exhales]
Kim (as Blaire): It’s not over.
Josie (as Minx): Oh, well.
Kim (as Blaire): She wants me dead. She told me.
Josie (as Minx): Well, we said we’d stand by you, so we’re gonna do that.
Minna (as Myra): We’re not gonna back down from that.
Kim (as Blaire): You don’t have to. I got us into this mess. It’s all my fault. I should be the one to take it out.
Josie (as Minx): It’s not.
Minna (as Myra): Did you let me face everything alone when Salia came back after me? Because that was my problem too.
Josie (as Minx): Besides, it’s also clear that Setarra’s an evil bitch and she used you, and none of us are gonna take that lying down.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s still my fault. I still tore this city apart because I didn’t know what I was getting into.
Josie (as Minx): Well, you made up for that mistake, and that’s what matters I think.
Minna (as Myra): You took responsibility. We wouldn’t have been able to stop that without you.
Kim (as Blaire): You kinda did, though.
Kim: Blaire just kinda gives that crooked grin.
Minna (as Myra): We wouldn’t have been able to stop it without all three of us. How is that?
Kim (as Blaire): [reluctant] Okay.
Minna (as Myra): And that’s also why it needs to be all three of us against Setarra.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m sorry it came to this.
Josie (as Minx): It’s… It’s all right. I don’t know what being around Setarra was like in private. You trusted her for a reason, I think.
Kim (as Blaire): She was nice to me. I mean, I was the one who brought her here in the first place and she didn’t kill me on-sight like they said all demons do, so… I don’t know.
Josie (as Minx): I can imagine that was encouraging.
Minna (as Myra): She took advantage of your trusting heart, and that’s on her, that’s not on you.
Josie (as Minx): Mm-hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): [tearful] I don’t wanna have a trusting heart anymore.
Josie: At that, Minx is just gonna big hug to Blaire, just {foomp}.
Kim (as Blaire): [whines]
Minna: I feel like Myra moves Blaire’s feet and props them in her lap as she sits down on the couch as well.
Kim: Aw.
Minna: Just doing the ankle pats.
Josie (as Minx): It’s all right to trust, and you weren’t necessarily wrong to trust her either.
Kim (as Blaire): No, Minx.
Josie (as Minx): She hurt you.
Kim (as Blaire): Minx, I was. I should have listened to everything that everybody ever told me about demons, and I just… I didn’t, because I was stupid and I wanted to try something that nobody had ever done before. I don’t know…
Josie (as Minx): Well, you did do something no one had ever done before.
Kim (as Blaire): I did?
Josie (as Minx): Yes. You’ve done a lot of things like that, and I’m sure no one’s trusted a demon before either, and it’s Setarra who squandered that opportunity.
Kim (as Blaire): Hmm… I don’t know. I think any demon would have squandered it.
Josie (as Minx): Maybe, but you have a good heart and no one can fault you for that.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m just so sorry.
Josie (as Minx): We know, and frankly I’m sorry too for not doing more to help sooner.
Minna (as Myra): I’m sorry that you didn’t realize until it got this bad, but that’s not all you.
Kim (as Blaire): The last score, the Archive of Echoes, was to help finish this. I needed something from in there to pull that thing out of whatever dimension it came from.
Josie (as Minx): Given how you were acting, I figured it wasn’t entirely what you were saying.
Minna (as Myra): Next time you need to tell us, though, even just so we know what we’re getting into, because I don’t like being put into situations where I don’t have all of the information at hand.
Kim (as Blaire): [tearful] I know. I’m sorry.
Minna (as Myra): I forgive you, I just need you to do better.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s just that the last thing that I was working on went badly, the whole spirit drugs thing, and she saw that, and she told me that… that this would make it all better, that this would work, that I’d go down in history, and it was all lies.
Josie: I think Minx is just gonna pull into a tighter hug with Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): I’m just worried that I’m gonna go down for the wrong reasons.
Minna (as Myra): Well, I don’t think history books are gonna look kindly on any of us, but we just gotta keep doing what we think is best.
Josie (as Minx): Well maybe they will if you end up writing them, Myra.
Minna (as Myra): [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): What are we gonna do? She’s gonna want to kill me. She said… She told me that she should have killed me, and now I think she’s gonna. She’s gonna try. We can’t fight her.
Josie (as Minx): Maybe we don’t need to fight her, but I think if we wanna go down in history for something, figuring out how to kill a demon wouldn’t be a bad thing to go down for.
Minna (as Myra): Yeah, we just have some research to do.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t want to kill her.
Minna (as Myra): Bind her? Send her somewhere else? There are other things than killing, especially with demons.
Josie (as Minx): That is… I think Myra just hit it on the head. If she wants to open up doors to other places so much let’s open one up and kick her through.
Kim (as Blaire): We’ll have to look into it. I don’t know. All I know is that she used to be my friend once, and I don’t want her to die.
Minna (as Myra): I understand that, I do, and if that’s the choice you make I’ll help you.
Josie (as Minx): I as well, of course.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Rhi: I think Hex comes padding down the stairs and jumps up onto Blaire’s lap in the middle of this group cuddle pile.
Minna: Aww!
Rhi: Curls up in a little Hex ball.
Josie: Aww.
Kim: Blaire’s just gonna scoop him up and just bury her face in him, you know, just kinda like that cat thing that you do, a big cat hug, and he’s just trying to squirm away but she’s not letting go.
Minna: [a “too cute” whine]
Rhi: Yep. So, we leave The Magpies sitting in their living room cuddled up on the couch, pan out of The Nest and across Six Towers. We see Bluecoats and Spirit Wardens just in and out of houses questioning people. There’s a lot of confusion, but nobody’s dead. Then, out to the Void Sea, and we plunge beneath the Void Sea and go down, down, down to the bottom of the sea, not too far from Duskwall, and we see these stone shapes that as the camera focuses in are all in the same shape as Setarra’s true form.
Kim: [breathy] Holy shit.
Rhi: Then we see a single twisted eel-like shape swim in front of them, and that is where we’re gonna end the season.

## Blooper [1:27:12]
Minna: I took stress during that dream, by the way. [chuckles]
Rhi: Um…
Josie: Oh dear.
Rhi: You did?
Minna: I used it on a roll and I didn’t declare it, but I did.
Rhi: Oh. [laughs] Okay, yeah, mark it.
Minna: I marked it.
Josie: Make sense?
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that is the kind of dream that you would wake up from and be like “I am not rested, I feel worse!”
Minna: Mm-hmm!"
"Season 3 Wrap-Up and Q&A Transcript","Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
## Intro
Rhi: Welcome to our Season 3 Wrap-Up and Q&A. A huge thanks to everyone who sent in questions. We had a ton of fun chatting about them, and of course thanks to all of you who have continued to support us through all three seasons so far. The end of this episode features a few clips from our Season 3 blooper reel, and our patrons should be able to listen to the whole thing on Patreon now.
As I mentioned last time, after this episode we’re going to have a pair of bonus episodes featuring Kim and Josie in Leviathan Song. Join a pair of leviathan hunters as their ship chases down one of the great immortal demons of the Void Sea. It’s pretty spooky and very gay, as one would expect from the show.
Also, Minna did an interview with the podcast Tales from the Fandom. Be sure to check it out on Monday, August 10. There’s a link to the podcast in the show notes.
Next, Minna is going to tell us about this month’s Featured Charity.
Minna: This month I would like to urge you to look for organizations providing health services and emergency resources like food pantries in your community. I will be making a donation to the St. Petersburg Free Clinic which is a multi-service independent non-profit that provides assistance with food, shelter, and healthcare to the underserved in Pinellas County. Currently they are experiencing increased need, and they are committed to continuing to provide services including a drive-thru food pantry. You can donate with me by going to StPetersburgFreeClinic.org/donate. Thank you!
Rhi: Please continue to contact your representatives, especially your senators, about further financial support for everyone in the US during this pandemic, and continue to push for better funding for the postal service. I’m sure everyone listening knows how absolutely vital the USPS is to our country and how it is being deliberately sabotaged by the people in charge of it. We need to demand that the sabotage be halted and the USPS be properly supported, especially now.
Now then, let’s get started. Shall we?
## Q&A [0:02:22]
Rhi: All right! Welcome everybody to our Season 3 Wrap-Up and Q&A! It’s kind of wild that we are at the end of a third season. [laughs] We’ve done—I’m pulling up our Simplecast right now. I’m trying to remember how many… How many episodes have we done now?
Kim: How many episodes total?
Rhi: Yeah, how many episodes total. I’m trying to find that.
Kim: Oh geez, I don’t even know.
Rhi: Uh, 57.
Kim: Wow!
Rhi: Between official episodes and wrap-ups and bonus episodes. So yeah, three seasons, 57 episodes, and here we are. I probably don’t need to have everybody introduce themself again, but we’re gonna so that I have an excuse to ask people questions.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: So, let’s start off, we’ll just go down the order we are here in Discord, so Kim. Wanna introduce yourself, say who you play? And then your question that everyone will be answering this recording is when in this season, in Season 3, were you the most proud of your character?
Kim: Ooh, that’s a good question. Okay.
Rhi: Thank you.
Kim: Anyways. Hi, I’m Kim, I play Blaire. When was I the most proud of Blaire? I have to go back and remember everything that she did in Season 3.
Minna: What the fuck happened in Season 3?
[laughter]
Kim: I know. For the listeners, it’s been so long since we’ve recorded anything that I’ve completely forgotten what Season 3 and… eh.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s all just sort of…
Kim: When was I the most proud of her? I mean, I think I just, by default, have to go with her finally breaking off from Setarra in the season finale, just like finally realizing that this person is not her friend. There’s going to be dire consequences of that, but…
Rhi: [smiling] Mm-hmm! Oh yes.
Kim: Heh. We won’t get into that now, but yeah. This is a turning-point in her arc that has been planned and I was looking forward to for a long time, her finally just putting her foot down and stepping away from all this. I am so excited for what we have planned and what’s coming next for her. So I think just by default I have to go with that.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s definitely a good moment for her.
Kim: Yes.
Josie: Hi, I’m Josie. I play Minx. I think I was most proud of Minx during the finale, just that when it came time to confront the horrible thing and go through the dreams and stuff her first response wasn’t “kill it with fire.”
Kim: yes! Yeah.
Josie: She’s come a long way and is starting to stable out a little bit, and maybe have a little bit more empathy for the things in the world that Blaire cares about.
Kim: Aw.
Josie: Her just taking a more chilled back role and trusting in the expertise of her companions and stuff. That’s where I was most proud.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Hi, I’m Minna. I play Myra. I am frantically scrolling through the episodes that happened in Season 3 trying to remember.
[laughter]
Kim: That was my problem! I don’t remember what happened in Season 3.
Minna: I can think of things that I’m really proud of the Magpies for doing, like our shared goals.
Rhi: Yes.
Minna: We got the clinic up and running, and we just did so much cool community stuff. I’m really struggling to think of a specific Myra moment at the moment. I don’t know why. I’m proud of her in general. She’s grown a lot. I’m having trouble pulling out a moment of my memory.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean that is A-OK. I don’t want this to be a difficult pop quiz.
Minna: It’s really just that I have to relisten to the episodes when they come out, because I have like no memory of things a lot of the time outside of vague sketchy blurs.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, well, and the fact there’s so much of a lag time between when we record and when the episode comes out.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: But I do really like that they’re finally getting to make big changes in their community which is such a big thing for both the crew and for Myra.
Rhi: Yeah. That was kind of what I was gonna, like, my response for this. I’m Rhi. I’m everybody else in the game.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: That was gonna be kind of my thing, what am I most proud of the Magpies for, and I think it’s exactly what, Minna, you just said. You know, you got the clinic up and running, you have helped Nyryx and her coworkers open up an employee-owned, or reopen the brothel where they work as an employee-owned institution, you know, you helped the Lampblacks and the people of The Docks start working together to start pushing out the gangs and the cops. Yeah, you have started to make some really solid, material changes in Duskwall, which is awesome.
Minna: We even connected some fangirl teens to some real resistance movements.
Rhi: Yes!
[laughter]
Kim: That’s right. Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, you helped some enthusiastic wayward youth to channel their energies in a direction that’s not gonna land all of you in jail. Yeah, that whole episode came because that’s one of the score prompts in the Vigilantes book, somebody is trading on your name to do stuff, and the way it was phrased in the book it sounded a little more malicious, but I’m like what if we made it really cute?
[giggles]
Kim: I had no idea it was even a book thing.
Josie: Aw.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. So yeah, as we pretty much always do in these wrap-ups we’ve got a bunch of questions from folks on Twitter, some of our Patreon backers… we’re just gonna go through some of them and chat about them.
So, the first question that we have is from a long-time fan who has submitted a great many questions and Devil’s Bargains. KrysmPhoenix, one of our patrons, asks: What other RPG system or setting could you imagine playing your character with their personality entirely intact? And then, for me specifically: Rhi, same for you, but a system or setting you can GM The Magpies in. So basically Krysm has just lobbed a generate AUs prompt at us.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Or different systems.
Rhi: Which is why Minna was completely losing her shit when she saw that prompt.
[laughter]
Rhi: Do any of you have thoughts on that?
Josie: I mean, I think we just saw it in the finale.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, we did see several possible AUs.
Josie: Not to step on Rhi’s toes, although I do think that the recent game Flying Circus could basically run The Magpies unchanged if we did that.
Rhi: Yeah, I haven’t gotten a chance to play that yet. It looks very cool.
Josie: It’s kinda like Blades in the Dark except instead of a score it’s a job involving planes.
Rhi: Oh cool!
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, so you could take Minx’s dream world and cross it with that and just have sky pirates.
Minna: Oh my God!
Josie: Yeah, exactly.
Kim: Oh my God. Skyjacks AU for Minx.
Josie: Yes.
Rhi: Oh man, yeah, basically.
Kim: I’ve been giving this some thought since it came up in the Discord server a few days ago. I think for me to play Blaire with her entire personality intact would not be hard in any given game provided that system has some kind of supernatural element in it, so I don’t know why but I can actually see her translating well to Masks. I feel like that there’s a Masks playbook for her where she would be well.
Josie: Oh yeah!
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Oh, interesting, yeah!
Kim: I just really like the idea of a modern AU Blaire who is just a diligent student but also like a cryptid chaser and a supernatural person.
Rhi: Oh my God, yeah.
Kim: Yeah!
Josie: She has posters saying “I wanna believe.”
Kim: Yes, exactly. Yup.
Minna: Low key, I think she’s the Doomed.
Kim: Definitely. Yeah.
Rhi: I feel like the Doomed or I could also see an argument for the Nova.
Minna: Yeah, or even Protégée if you count Setarra as a very bad mentor.
Rhi: Ooh! Ooh!
Kim: You could. You could, yeah. I’ve only played Masks once, so I’m not super familiar with the playbooks, but yeah, what I said, she could translate well to D&D or even Edge of the Empire.
Rhi: Yeah. I think Masks might be a better choice than even Edge of the Empire or D&D, because in those settings there is supernatural stuff but it’s very accepted by the world.
Kim: That’s true. Yes.
Rhi: Like everybody in D&D knows there’s magic. masks you can have, like… there’s a lot more room for variance where Blaire could be into some, you know, the way she is in our game, into some very weird shit where people are like “um… are you sure about that?”
[laughter]
Kim: yes. Yeah, I totally see where you’re coming from.
Minna: Here’s the thing. I really like AUs, and I’ve been doing them for so long in fan fiction and RP that I could stick her anywhere with her personality intact, but I would really enjoy Star Wars.
[laughter]
Kim: Mood.
Minna: I know that we’ve talked about it in the server, but I really enjoy that AU. Occasionally I play with that in my head a little bit. It’s very good.
Rhi: Yeah, I think that was my slightly cop-out answer, was basically Scum and Villainy…
Minna: Uh-huh. Yeah, no.
Kim: Yeah, yeah.
Rhi: …which is the Forged in the Dark, Star Wars with serial numbers filed off, game.
Minna: Definitely that more than even Edge of the Empire I think, in terms of actually playing.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think that would be a very fun alternate universe version of the crew, because the other thing with that is you could also continue to do very similar types of scores just in space, on a spaceship.
Minna: Mm-hmm! Oh man, just imagine the magpies being like, this planet, Rebels style, this planet is ours, we will defend it and free it from the Empire.
[giggling]
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yep. Ah, yeah, a Star Wars AU of The Magpies is very good.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah. We’ve definitely discussed it before. I remember.
Rhi: Yeah. All right. So the next question is from Michelle Kelly who is one of our transcriptionists.
Minna: Yay~
Kim: Thank you Michelle Kelly.
Rhi: Yeah, so huge shout-out to Michelle. She does phenomenal work. If you’re looking for a transcriber of your podcasts I highly recommend her and also our other transcriber who sent in a question as well. So Michelle’s question: Does the group plan out big plot twists in advance or does Rhi just give a general idea and then reveal the twist during recording? For example, the reveal of the final member of the Circle of Flame.
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: I can sort of start on this a little. I think the last time that I kept a really big plot twist from you was the Rigney thing.
Kim: Yes.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: I think that’s the only big plot twist you’ve kept from us.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah…
Minna: Most of the time it’s us planning them together and building them up together.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Well, it seems to be like plot twists that directly involve our characters are planned in advance, ones that are more relevant to the NPCs… don’t get told.
Kim: You kinda keep to yourself.
Josie: yeah.
Rhi: Yeah… yeah. That was kind of why I was like “I think this is what I do, more or less,” but you know I couldn’t exactly remember. Yeah. For the example given here, yeah, we had talked about the reveal with Tesslyn for a while, because we knew that was gonna be a huge thing for Minx, so we knew kind of what that was gonna be. I will say, one thing that I did kind of hold back a little bit was I had planned to ask Kim to describe Setarra’s demon form pretty much since the show started. [laughs]
Kim: Wait, you did? You’ve been asking me to describe it?
Rhi: No-no-no, I had that planned that whenever her demon form was finally revealed that I was just gonna hand it to you.
Kim: Yes. Yes. Yeah, that was one twist that I as a player did not see coming, in that moment when Setarra transformed. Blaire and Setarra coming to a head was something that was planned for the season finale. That’s something that Rhi and I have discussed for a long time about how we wanna do that, how we wanna make that look, how do we come to this moment. I did not know that Setarra was going to transform into her demon form during that confrontation in the season finale, so she asked me on the spot what does this look like.
Rhi: [laughs] Yes.
Kim: And I was so excited, because I did not see that coming at all.
Rhi: Yeah. I had been sitting on that for literally years. When I was outlining my notes for Setarra I deliberately did not describe what I think her demon form looks like, because I’m like “I’m just gonna hand that to Kim.”
Kim: [smiling] Oh my gosh. That actually makes me very happy. Thank you. For what it’s worth, I’m very happy with what we come up with. I kind of envision it a little differently than how I described it in the episode, but yeah, I’m happy with what we came up with for her.
Rhi: Yeah, it was very creepy.
Minna: I do very much enjoy the way that we plan stuff out a little bit together. I enjoy that style of collaboration and knowing at least in advance where you’re going even if you don’t know how you’re getting there. I like that a lot.
Rhi: Yeah, I will say as a GM that’s actually been a shift for me from when I started out, because I got into RPGs through D&D 3.5, and D&D… 5th Edition tries to be a little bit better about it, but eh…
Josie: Eh-heh.
Rhi: D&D generally sets up the GM and players in opposition, and there’s very much an attitude of you can’t tell the players what your plans are because then the players will try to thwart them.
Kim: That’s stupid.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs. So I was used to this approach of make all of these broad sprawling plans and then keep them secret, and you know, hand out little nuggets of information when the players roll well enough, and that… it doesn’t work super well in my experience. For the kind of games that I like to play and that I like to run I much prefer to have at least some… and it varies from game to game. I’m in some games where we have a little looser goals, but at least having some goals for a character or knowing roughly, yeah, like Minna said, knowing where you’re aiming for, and then even if you know what your target is, how you get there is not set in stone.
Josie: Right.
Kim: Yeah. For what it’s worth, all the games that I’ve ever been in that I enjoy the most are the character-driven ones where there is a lot of discussion out of character and in between sessions, between the GM and the players, you know, what are your goals, what do we want to do, whereas if you’re playing with a GM who just, you know, keeps on smiling and doesn’t tell you anything, I personally don’t find that fun.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Yeah. The smiling GM is fun when you’re just doing a one-session, really crunchy dungeon crawl where there is no plot. [laughs]
Kim: Right. Exactly. That’s the only instance where I think I can tolerate it, but for long-term campaigns that’s not what I look for in a GM. That’s not my idea of fun.
Minna: Yeah. I think my playstyle is always gonna be a little influenced by doing other kinds of RP before this.
Rhi: Yeah. So, we are now going to move into a special segment that I have dubbed the Kevin Brown Power Hour.
[laughter]
Kim: (singing) Kevin Brown!
Rhi: Because one of our patrons, Kevin Brown, submitted like seven questions. We’re not doing all seven, sorry Kevin, but we did pull out some of our top ones here that we really liked. So, first question: What was your favorite outfit for your character from this season or any season that we have done?
Kim: Ooh~ [laughs]
Josie: That’s…
Kim: Minx?
Rhi: I knew this was gonna be a good one for Josie. [laughs]
Josie: I think it’s either the masquerade ball outfit or the pirate outfit.
Rhi: Ooh, both good choices.
Josie: Yeah, like, serious answer, Minx’s masquerade ball outfit with the open back and jewelry and stuff, silly answer, pirate outfit.
[laughter]
Kim: Yeah, my answer is definitely the masquerade ball, because I remember during that session—I frequently doodle during sessions, because as an artist it’s just kind of what helps me pay attention, in like almost any situation, so I draw a lot while we’re recording—and I remember during that session I actually drew Blaire’s outfit. I don’t know if I’ve ever shared it. The masquerade ball where Blaire just absolutely hammed it up with the Magpies aesthetic and yet nobody suspected her of actually being a Magpie.
Rhi: [laughing] Yeah.
Kim: I think that’s my favorite look that I’ve ever done for her.
Minna: What outfits has she worn? [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, that’s a… Myra really—
Minna: Oh! You know what my favorite was?
Rhi: Uh-huh?
Minna: The time Blaire made her over to go talk to the youths.
[laughter]
Kim: Oh, that’s right! Yes!
Minna: yes!
Rhi: Yes, that’s right, when you went to the bar.
Minna: Just delightful.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: The masquerade was also very good, but just in terms of it being a very fun and funny thing to envision.
Rhi: Yeah, Myra pretty much only dresses up in sort of unique outfits for scores, but I feel like when she does have a different outfit it’s like wildly off the rails, like dressing up to hang out with the youths or disguising herself as a ghost to haunt an alleyway.
Minna: [laughing, delighted] Oh my God! I forgot about that one! [laughing, unintelligible]
Rhi: Yeah! I was just trying to think back about disguises from this season.
Minna: Oh God. How much Sherlock Holmes DNA do we think there is in Myra that I didn’t realize I was putting in there?
[laughter]
Josie: A lot.
Rhi: Quite a bit.
Minna: I have a type. Oh God, did I know that? Did I know there was Sherlock Holmes in Myra?
Rhi: I think on some unconscious level, probably. So the next question, still from Kevin Brown: What food would your character love from our world that they can’t have in theirs?
Kim: That is such a good question, because there’s so much food that doesn’t exist in Blades in the Dark.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: Yeah, or like isn’t practical, like a cheeseburger… [laughs]
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: …would be basically impossible. I don’t even know. I think we had determined that cows don’t exist anymore.
Kim: Yeah. Yeah.
Rhi: But yeah!
Kim: Hmm… I think ice cream. I know that we’ve established that ice cream kind of—
Rhi: There’s goat’s milk.
Kim: Yeah, goat’s milk ice cream exists in this setting, but from what I understand it’s a rare snack for common people.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: I’ll try to think of something else, now that I’m thinking about it, because I know that there’s so much food options that we have in the real world that don’t exist in Blades.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Come back to me if I don’t think of anything else.
Rhi: Yeah!
Josie: I think Minx just would enjoy all kinds of fruit, because we barely have that.
Rhi: Yeah. I think we’ve established that there’s like apples available in Duskwall.
Kim: You know what I think I can see Blaire really enjoying is sushi. I know that probably exists in Blades because fish exist, but…
Rhi: It might not, because the fish, like, I don’t think you wanna eat the fish coming out of the Void Sea raw. [laughs.
Josie: Uh-huh. [laughs]
Kim: Exactly, yeah, which is why my brain went to sushi. I was just like, you know, in a modern AU I can see Blaire being really into sushi, but I don’t think we ever established that exists in our setting.
Rhi: Yeah, I don’t… I would imagine not.
Kim: All right, so that’s my final answer. Blaire likes sushi.
Rhi: All right.
Minna: Myra has strong, strong tea connoisseur energy, but tea isn’t really a thing because leaves aren’t as much of a thing.
Rhi: Yeah. I think that it’s just kinda… I mean, you can make tea out of kind of anything. I think that a lot of…
Kim: Right.
Minna: Yeah, and she drinks mushroom tea, and we’ve had basil tea.
Kim: Tea does… yeah.
Rhi: I think that a lot of… yeah, the tea that we have in the real world where it is like “a tea plant” is not really a thing that exists.
Kim: Now that we’re talking about it, I can see Blaire being really into boba tea, too.
Minna: Oh, yeah!
Josie: Aw!
Rhi: Also, possibly coffee. I don’t know if coffee’s really a thing in Blades.
Kim: You’re probably right. I don’t think coffee exists. Oh my God, in any setting that has coffee Blaire is a coffee junkie, for sure.
Rhi: Hmm, I’m just kind of… I feel like, yeah, coffee is something that needs—
Kim: It’s a bean, so…
Rhi: Yeah, well, it needs a lot of sun. It’s a tropical plant.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: So might be difficult.
Minna: There’s another AU for us. Classic.
Rhi: Coffee shop AU?
Kim: God, this is such a good question.
Rhi: Yeah. So, the final question in the Kevin Brown Power Hour, another one that Minna was really excited about is: We haven’t seen much about the history of the world in the show. How would your character describe how the world has changed, and what is the most important or impactful historical event to your character’s history? [laughing] Now this question assumes a certain level of out of character knowledge of Blades history.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: And like, there’s also, the history of the setting is left fairly open. Like, there’s some major events…
Kim: Yeah. The book, from what I’ve read, it doesn’t go too much into the history of Duskwall, it’s just like this is a setting, it’s a pre-cataclysmic world, do what you will.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: There’s like some bullet points, but they’re very vague, and I have extrapolated a lot.
Rhi: Uh-huh. [laughs] I’m kinda flipping to the, uh, there’s a timeline in the book somewhere but it’s like one page. There’s the founding of Duskwall, the Cataclysm…
Kim: Did I say pre? I meant post-cataclysmic.
Rhi: Yes. [laughs]
Minna: We knew what you meant.
Josie: Yeah, whatever. [chuckles]
Rhi: Yeah, there’s just not a ton of stuff. I think probably the most recent major event for everybody is the Unity War.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: Ooh, yeah.
Kim: What was the second part of the question? It was like, you know, what piece of history is most important to your character or whatever?
Rhi: Yeah, basically. What historical event has… and I think, yeah, you can make stuff up too, because the history is so…
Kim: Yeah, because I was going to say, I feel like for Blaire it would have to be something to do with the history of Tycheros which the book doesn’t go too much into.
Rhi: No.
Kim: Yeah… so I don’t know.
Rhi: I mean, it could very well just be Tycheros joining the Empire.
Kim: That too, yeah.
Rhi: Which, you know, because that’s how Blaire would be able to be a student in Duskwall.
Kim: I guess so, yeah, because her going… Blaire comes from a middle class family, and I don’t know if this is common knowledge amongst the listeners or not, but she got to Charterhall University with merit. She was offered help with her tuition by the university, so her leaving her family and going to Duskwall to be able to attend university was a huge deal for her family.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: So, yeah, I think that has to be my answer, Tycheros joining the Empire, because that must have happened either before or during her lifetime that allowed her to get into the city in the first place.
Rhi: Definitely before.
Kim: Before? Okay.
Rhi: Yeah. The details on how Tycheros ended up being part of the Empire are pretty vague, most of the rest of the regions of the Empire we kind of know how they came in, either war or threat of war, but Tycheros is so far away that I don’t really know how that happened, but somehow they ended up deciding that joining the Empire was the right thing to do.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: But yeah, other thoughts on this?
Minna: Honestly, my money is on the leviathan hunters kind of figuring out that they could get fuel from the leviathans, because I think a lot of the industry of Duskwall ends up built around that and it’s so central to the ruling class here. So I think… yeah.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I was gonna say, you’re nobility in Duskwall if you own leviathan hunters.
Minna: And I think also for Myra so much of her life has been affected by just industry existing and being a prominent part of Duskwall culture, because she was born in a factory family, and yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, that makes sense. What about Minx?
Josie: Yeah, like, I feel like this is kind of a cop-out answer because it affects everyone very much, but just any element of class struggle I think.
Rhi: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Josie: In that case I think it might be the same as Myra, the advent of the nobility is kind of that, or the introduction of capitalism into Blades in the Dark.
Minna: Yeah, that’s what I was trying to pinpoint, basically.
Rhi: Yeah.
[laughter]
Kim: Yeah, no, I don’t think that’s a cop-out answer at all, Josie, because Minx and Myra were both born into poverty, for sure, and that informs both of their characters very much.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Right.
Minna: Specifically in Charhollow which is shaped by that.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yes. Absolutely.
Rhi: Yeah, I don’t know how the economy evolved in this setting really if it… Because you know, specifically before the Cataclysm it was sort of a much more idyllic fantasy setting.
Minna: So Duskwall started out as like a coal mining outpost.
Rhi: A mining outpost. Ironically, founded by Skovlan. [laughs]
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Oh really? I didn’t know that.
Minna: I did a whole Magpies Quills post about how we became Akorosian and not Skovlanders.
Rhi: Yeah. It was originally a mining settlement.
Minna: Doskvol means coalmine of the Skov.
Kim: I knew none of this, but that’s also because I don’t read.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Or, I think it was “Doskovol” originally.
Rhi: Yeah, because it was founded a couple centuries before the Cataclysm, and then the Cataclysm happened and they were basically cut off from Skovlan, so by the time sea travel was reestablished the allegiance had shifted. So yeah. Thank you, Kevin, for your many, many questions.
Kim: Thank you, Kev.
Rhi: They were all very good and thought-provoking ones. So, the next question that we have is from BlueKryptonite04 on Twitter. This will be a pretty quick answer probably mostly from me. Their question is: Selfishly, could you or have you considered a weekly release? I was behind for like a season and a half, but now waiting two weeks for each new episode can be tough. Thanks! Love the Magpies.
Thank you! Yeah, I considered a weekly release when I was planning the show, and I considered my ability to edit and record that quickly, my ability and the cast, and it’s just not feasible, you know, with all of the other commitments that we have.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: I have a, like, just purely from an editing perspective, I have a full-time job, I’m in several other RPGs… I would have to give up a lot of my other extracurriculars to stay on top of that editing schedule, and that would make this not fun. Honestly, I probably would have gotten really badly burned out a long time ago if I did a weekly release.
Kim: I would say that for all of us, too, I think the every other week recording and release schedule just works for our schedules better, because we all have lives and we’re all, almost all of us are in other games, so our schedules flip-flop around a lot and it can be tough to get us all together, because we are scheduling… we’re all in different time zones almost.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah, there’s also that.
Minna: Spread across the continental US.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s just, in order to keep this as a sustainable, fun project it’s an every other week thing. If I had both the money and the mental ability to delegate, [laughs] and be less of a control freak, and I could hire an editor, it would be a different story, but yeah. I enjoy editing the episodes. I really like doing that piece of it. So yeah, for me to keep doing it it’s gotta be every other week. I know the two week wait can be rough, but it’s what makes it possible for the show to kind of keep going.
So, another question from Twitter from Sleppy I think is how I would pronounce that, that’s my best guess, simply asks: So when are you gonna steal a leviathan hunter ship?
[chuckling]
Josie: I suppose the answer must be soon.
Rhi: At some point!
Minna: [smiling] Who knows. Oh my God, though, none of us knows how to sail.
Rhi: Yeah. I think maybe that’s the answer, when the Magpies learn how to sail or they befriend a ship captain.
Kim: Yeah, none of us know how to sail, Phin is God knows where… I feel like Blaire would absolutely love to spend a week on a leviathan hunter ship as a passenger, but she does not know the first thing about sailing at all.
Rhi: And the fact that she thinks she would enjoy being on a leviathan hunter ship as a passenger says that she should not be on one, because like… [laughs]
Kim: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Rhi: Like, they’re whaling ships basically, so it’s not a fun expedition.
Kim: Yeah, no, in her mind being on a leviathan hunter ship she would be there as an observer and a researcher. She would be like taking notes and like cartography and noticing all of whatever fauna that they dredge up. She would not be there to actually harpoon anything, because “what are you doing, that’s an animal, that’s a supernatural creature, no!”
Rhi: Heh, it’s a demon, a massive, massive demon that has smaller demons living on it.
Kim: Yeah. [laughs] No, she doesn’t care about that, she just wants to learn more about it.
Minna: Is it canon in our version of the Blades world that some ships are driven by, like, almost demons? Because that was a really fun aspect. I don’t remember if it ever crossed over into this world, but I deeply, I have a need for Kim to meet that ship.
Rhi: A game that Waffles originally GMed that I was not in but Minna was.
Minna: The one Seeks is from.
Rhi: Yeah. All the leviathan hunters were fueled by or were, not fueled but sort of guided by bound demons. That might be canonical. I’m not sure.
Minna: I don’t know if it’s canonical to the book, but I feel like it came up in this game somewhere, but I might be wrong, I don’t remember… but I would like Kim to meet one of those.
Rhi: If there is more information on that it would be in the Leviathan Song expansion pack I suppose. So yeah, I think the answer to when are you gonna steal a leviathan hunter ship is when somebody learns how to captain one. Minx could definitely get the outfit, but that does not…
[laughter]
Josie: Yeah, and I mean that’s the most important part, right?
Rhi: Yeah. That does not convey upon you the knowledge needed to sail a ship.
Josie: Eh, I’ve read enough novels.
Kim: Also, I feel like… This is kind of a cynical point of view, but I feel like we wouldn’t get away with stealing an entire ass leviathan ship.
Rhi: [breathy] Oh, no.
Kim: Because we would have to dock it somewhere.
Rhi: Yep, yeah, and there’s only—
Kim: You know?
Josie: Well no, here’s how it goes down. We steal it and immediately crash it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: We successfully stole it, we just didn’t keep it.
Rhi: We moved it, slightly.
Minna: I will say that I think Seeks might actually know how or at least know somebody who knows how, just saying.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s true. I think Seeks in her past did spend some time on a leviathan hunter, but Seeks has a rich tapestry of life experiences prior to coming to Duskwall.
Minna: Seeks was briefly a pirate, I think.
Rhi: Yeah, for a little while, yeah.
Kim: Yeah, from a practical standpoint, leviathan hunter ships are huge and we’re only a crew of three people against… and if we were to steal a ship from an entire leviathan hunter crew, which could be I don’t know 20, 30, 50 people, I don’t know what the standard number is for a crew.
Rhi: Yeah, I think it’s more than that.
Kim: I don’t think we could get away with it as a crew.
Rhi: All right. So, the next question comes from Christian Chou, I think that’s how that’s pronounced, also on Twitter. Blades is a system based around playing a character and running the risk of seeing them die. Have you talked about what would happen if someone dies in the game, and is it something that you look forward to or dread? Love your podcast, trying to catch up.
Kim: Huh…
Rhi: Hopefully you have caught up by the time this goes live. So, one of the things with Blades, which actually we literally just discussed in the episode I was editing earlier today, is that because of the stress mechanic the players can resist any consequence that I give them up to and including death. So, death is something that only happens with the player saying yes, I want my character to die, otherwise I can be like hey, you took level 4 harm, you’re dead, and the player can be like actually no, I might be very badly injured, but I am still alive, because the dice said so. Which is something I really, really like about the system. I don’t know… We haven’t really talked about it.
Kim: Yeah. I was just gonna say, going off of that, that out of character I don’t think any of us have ever discussed our characters dying, because I don’t think it’s something that’s ever even crossed any of our minds because of the way the stress mechanic works.
Josie: It’s crossed mine. I don’t want it to happen to Minx, but I remember having a discussion that were Minx to quote-unquote “die,” vampire Minx?
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Right. That’s the other thing, if your character dies, like… Blaire could die and just come back as a ghost character. [laughs]
Kim: Exactly, yeah, and she would be thrilled. Yeah, exactly.
Minna: There’s three different playbooks you can choose after you die.
Josie: If Minx died her ghost would just be like huh, I make a good-looking corpse, let me get back in there.
[laughter]
Rhi: Yeah. “I’m too beautiful to be dead!”
Josie: Yes.
Kim: Yeah, I think that’s one of the things I like about this system is that there’s a lot of freedom about death in this game whereas if your character dies there are still avenues, and not to say that other systems don’t have this, but there’s a lot of interesting avenues where you can continue playing as your character in different ways should your character experience a death.
Minna: The thing I do like about Blades is that you don’t even really have to have that conversation about death, I mean obviously it’s good as a group to be on the same page, but like we definitely had to talk about that in D&D because…
Kim: Right. Yeah.
Minna: …death is a very real risk in D&D, and I don’t ever want my player character to die unless it is something that I have set up very carefully and really want.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m in the same boat.
Minna: Highly, highly, highly unlikely I’ll ever do that to Myra, because I don’t think that’s the story we’re telling here for her. She has been learning how to live.
Kim: Agreed. At this point Blaire is a character that is very near and dear to my heart, and death is not something that I want for her at all.
Rhi: Yeah. I think having a character die and just leave the show, particularly at this point, would be very unsatisfying I think.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Kim: And very devastating, I think, just in and out of character.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah, which is why I like that the decision is 100% in the player’s hands as opposed to, like Minna said, D&D. We had to have a pretty… For one of the games that Minna and I are both in, we had to have a very lengthy conversation about how death will be handled and everybody’s comfort level with having death be a threat for their character, because if you play D&D rules as written, if the dice say you die, you die, and that’s it.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: So yeah, I really like how Blades handles it. As much as I might kind of delight in throwing challenges and stuff at the characters when I’m GMing, ultimately I am on their side. I want the characters to win and succeed. I like putting them in hard situations because it’s cool to see how you all get out of them, and sometimes because, you know, you have to face down the consequences of your actions, but ultimately I’m not out here trying to kill off the Magpies, that’s not fun.
Josie: Right.
Kim: Yeah, no. This is a bit of a tangent, but Rhi, I think that’s one of my favorite aspects of you as a game master is that you love…
Rhi: Aw.
Kim: I know this about you because we’ve been friends for so long. When you are a game master you love to instill the fear of death into your players, but I know you as a game master that you don’t actually want any of us to die.
Rhi: No!
Josie: Uh-huh.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: [giggles]
Kim: Game masters who feel like they are against their players or like they want their players to die, to me in my opinion that’s not a good game master.
Minna: It’s very much the fan fic writer’s approach where you want your characters to suffer, because that’s where the drama is…
Rhi: Yes.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: …but you also want them to come out the other side because you love them to death.
Rhi: Yes! Yes, that’s… yes, and excellent summation. My favorite fan fic trope is hurt comfort, so…
Kim: Same!
[laughter]
Minna: Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!
Rhi: Here we are!
Kim: Yeah, this is why this works so well.
Minna: This is why I’m like this about Devil’s Bargains.
Rhi: Magpies, 1.5 million words, hurt comfort, 57 chapters. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Other tags on this hypothetical fan fic, found family.
Rhi: Mm-hmm!
Kim: And we’ve done there was only one bed.
Rhi: Yes, we did.
[laughter]
Minna: Oh God! I love that this is… This is why we work, isn’t it?
Rhi: Yeah. Oh man.
Kim: Yeah, this is why we all work well together is because we all read fan fiction.
Rhi: All right, so the last question that I have, this comes in from Tyler_MoonSage who is I think the very first transcriptionist, transcriber that I hired. They are phenomenal to work with. They also are one of the leaders of DOTS RPG which creates resources for blind and low vision gamers, so like braille dice and other cool resources like that.
Kim: Hell yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, Tyler is just a delightful person, and I love this question that they sent in. Which Pokémon would each magpie have on their teams if they were trainers?
[others gasp]
Minna: Oh!
Kim: I’ve thought about this! Yes! Thank you!
Josie: Whole teams or like signatures?
Kim: [clapping] Yes! Yes!
Rhi: I think you can give as many or as few Pokémon as you want.
Kim: Oh, I’m so happy.
Rhi: I also made an addition for myself which was, I will add this after you all have given your answers, I added for me what type of Gym Leaders would some of the villains be. [laughs]
Minna: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Kim: Ooh~ Oh my God, I’m so… For the record, listeners, I did not look at any of the questions before we started recording this. I’m so happy because I have thought about, you know, Blaire as a Pokémon Trainer before.
Josie: Excellent.
Rhi: So yeah, what Pokémon would you all have on your teams?
Minna: Can I just very quickly—this is not Myra’s—Rigney has a Growlithe. I insist.
Josie: Yes. Yes, absolutely.
Rhi: Yeah~
Kim: Yes! Yes, because it’s Hound’s Bar, Hound’s paw.
Minna: The Hound’s Paw is named for the Growlithe.
Rhi: What’s it named, Minna?
Minna: No-no-no, The Hound’s Paw is named The Hound’s Paw because Rigney has a Growlithe.
Rhi: Oh! Yes, that’s very good. This is extremely good.
Kim: Okay, so Blaire is definitely a Ghost-type trainer. She has a Gastly. She has a Mimikyu. She has… God, I have to look up Ghost-types. I know I’ve thought… Come back to me.
Rhi: [laughs]
Josie: [laughs] Hmm, I feel—
Kim: Let me pull up Bulbapedia real quick.
Rhi: [chuckles]
Josie: I feel like Minx is a Fairy-type trainer.
Rhi: yeah, I was gonna say Fairy or…
Josie: And her favorite Pokémon is Gardevoir probably.
Rhi: I was gonna say Fairy or Dragon.
Josie: I am a Dragon trainer. Minx is a Fairy-type I think.
Rhi: [laughs] I see.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Has to be the most extra.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Kim: So, Blaire definitely has a Mimikyu, a Mismagius, I would think a Cofagrigus.
Rhi: The PokéRap is now playing in my head.
[laughter]
Kim: Yeah, I’m sorry.
Rhi: No, don’t apologize!
Kim: She would definitely have… It’s a good song.
Rhi: It is.
Kim: She’d definitely have a Gastly and a Gengar for sure. I could see her with a Lunala if she managed to capture a legendary. I’m literally just looking at Bulbapedia right now, but like, Blaire would work well with any Ghost-type Pokémon, hands down.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: She’s just a Ghost-type trainer.
Josie: Right. Okay, I’m looking at a list of Fairy-type Pokémon. I know Minx would have Alolan Ninetales, because it’s all sparkly and blue, Galarian Rapidash, because look at that thing.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Yes! Yes, yes, you’re completely right and you should say it.
Josie: It’s gorgeous. Gardevoir, because it’s so elegant. Who else would she have? She might have a Primarina. Primarina would work.
Kim: She would definitely have a Primarina.
Josie: Happy fairy seal. Yay.
Rhi: [giggles]
Josie: Hatterene, because it’s a fashion Pokémon.
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah.
Josie: And then…
Minna: Does Minx have a Jynx?
Josie: She does not have a Jynx, because Jynx creeps me out and I don’t like it.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Josie: And I think Mimikyu, she might have sympathy for Mimikyu.
Kim: Aww! Our Mimikyus can be friends. I forgot to mention, Blaire definitely also has a Murkrow.
Rhi: Oh yeah.
Josie: Nice.
Minna: Beautiful. I can’t decide with Myra. Like, on the one hand, I think she actually might be a Normal-type trainer. I mean, I, Minna, enjoy a lot of these Pokemon, and they’re very versatile which I think is very Myra. I could also see some Dark in there, though. I could totally see her with an Umbreon.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yes. Yeah.
Josie: I think Salia is definitely the Dark-type Gym Leader.
Rhi: See, I was thinking Psychic for her.
Kim: [gasps]
Minna: Oh, mm-hmm! Uh-huh! Mm-hmm!
Josie: Oh, because she fucks with your head? Sure.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: What about Psychic/Poison-types? Did those exist?
Rhi: Probably.
Josie: They’re out there, I think.
Rhi: Yeah, I had Salia as the Psychic-type Gym Leader just waging psychological warfare on everyone.
Josie: Right.
Kim: yeah, that fits.
Rhi: Yeah. I could see Normal-Dark mix for Myra for sure.
Josie: Mm-hmm, and there are Normal and Dark Pokemon now, like Obstagoon.
Minna: Mm-hmm, but I think like… I like her with a Persian. I like her with a Pidgeot. There’s a lot of really good Normal Pokémon for Myra I think.
Josie: I like that too.
Kim: I feel like it goes without saying, Setarra is like, you know, a Water-type Gym Leader.
Rhi: Oh yeah.
Kim: Water/Dark. I’m sure those exist, I just can’t remember any off the top of my head right now.
Rhi: Yeah, she definitely is the Water Gym Leader.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: I’m trying to think. Where’s my list? Tesslyn is the Ghost Gym Leader.
Josie: Okay.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: That tracks.
Rhi: I’m trying to remember my other Circle of Flame members.
Minna: Ooh, what’s Mora?
Rhi: Rock.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: For reasons that will be revealed later.
Minna: What?!
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: What does that mean?
Rhi: That means I maybe have some secrets still and I was lying a little bit when I said I reveal everything.
Kim: Oh no!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Although no, Josie did get it correct that when it comes to some NPCs I do still keep some secrets.
Kim: Rhi, I know he’s not an enemy, but what do you think of Bazso?
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: Ooh! Dark. Dark/Fighting.
Josie: Yeah.
Kim: Fighting, yes, I could see Fighting for him.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Oh, no, you know what, not Dark, Steel.
Minna: Yeah!
Kim: Yeah, Steel/Fighting.
Josie: Yeah, I like that.
Rhi: Steel/Fighting, for sure.
Kim: Steel/Fighting for him, definitely.
Josie: He definitely has a Lucario.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yes! Yes he does. Ooh! While we’re at it, Jeren?
Minna: Oh buddy, he’s a Bug trainer.
[laughter]
Rhi: Nope, you’re right.
Kim: Yes! Yes!
Rhi: Yeah, no, you’re right.
Minna: I love that I didn’t even have to stop and think, I just knew he’s a fucking nerd.
Rhi: Yeah!
Kim: You’re so right.
Rhi: [giggles] What were you gonna say, Josie?
Josie: What type is Nyryx?
Rhi: Ooh…
Kim: Hmm.
Rhi: I can see… Hmm. Possibly also Fairy.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Potentially, I’m looking at Grass-type though, also.
Minna: Oh my God, that would be so cute!
Kim: There’s a lot of cute Grass-types.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: In a modern AU Nyryx has an apartment that is just filled with plants.
Josie: Yeah, Grass-types.
Rhi: Like, my original mental image of her apartment I had to edit out all of the plants, because she just would have terrariums and potted plants everywhere.
Josie: Aww.
Rhi: She’s just… yeah. I think I could see Grass-type.
Josie: Yeah, let’s go with that.
Minna: And she has the vibes of people you encounter in the anime who have Grass-types.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: I just thought of this. For those of you who have played Pokémon games, sometimes you come across trainers who are teams, and sometimes you have 2v2 battles.
Rhi: Yes!
Kim: So, Lani and Roxanne.
Minna: Yes!
Rhi: Ooh!
Josie: [gasps] Aw!
Rhi: Ooh, oh that’s good.
Kim: Yeah. What kind of trainers would they be as a team?
Rhi: Yeah!
Minna: I think that… I think Lani might be ground. I just really like that idea.
Rhi: Yeah, I was gonna say Ground or Fighting.
Kim: I can see Ground for her.
Minna: Minx! Those mix well.
Rhi: Yeah. Roxanne?
Josie: Flying maybe?
Minna: I like that a lot!
Rhi: I was thinking Flying, yeah.
Minna: They’d balance each other, and then she can have like a Zubat, because I feel like she has a Zubat.
Kim: Yeah~
Rhi: [laughs] I think that—
Josie: And the Flying person can attack them while the other one spams Earthquake. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I think they both have Fighting-types, Lani has Fighting/Ground, Roxanne has Fighting/Flying, and they will just ruin your day.
[chuckling]
Minna: Seeks has a Chansey.
Rhi: I can message Waffles right now and find out what Seeks would be.
Kim: Kay I feel like would be Water and Fighting. She would have a mix of both.
Rhi & Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: Definitely a Blastoise in there.
Kim: Yes! Absolutely.
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah.
Minna: We could go on forever. This is gonna be an entire episode’s worth of us thinking about…
Rhi: Yeah, no, this was extremely—this is why I saved it for last, because I knew that we were gonna get real deep into it.
Minna: Ugh, I’m real into it.
Kim: Thank you. Thank you for this question.
Josie: Is there anyone who’s a Dragon-type trainer?
Rhi: That’s what I’ve been thinking. I’ve been trying to figure out if we have anybody.
Kim: Scurlock?
Rhi: No. Scurlock is a pure Dark, because he’s a fucking edge lord.
Kim: You’re right.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Consider lady Drake, not just because of the pun, but also because of the pun.
Rhi: Oh, okay, so Lady Drake for Dragon, I thought about that, but I think she’s Ice.
Minna: Ah.
Kim: Yes. You’re right.
Minna: But you could be both. They mix well.
Rhi: Yeah. We haven’t had anybody who’s a Fire-type.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Myra has at least one Fire-type though is the thing.
Minna: [laughs] I’m so mad I didn’t say Fire-type as a joke for Myra!
Rhi: Myra has mostly Normal and then a Charizard.
Minna: One. She gets one late. Late in the game she gets a Fire-type that she ends up bonding real hard with.
[laughter]
Kim: What about our Deathland Scavengers? What about Dowler and Rigney’s brother?
Rhi: Oh, Nevan. Um… gosh.
Josie: Oh, well I think we may have established that Rigney is a Fire-type trainer, right, because he has a Growlithe?
Minna: Oh yeah.
Kim: Right, yeah. Rigney could be Fire-type.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, I could actually see that. Waffles has informed me that Seeks would have adopted a Grimer or that new garbage monster.
Kim: Yeah!
Josie: Yes, she’s Poison-type. Perfect.
Kim: Yeah. Yes-yes-yes.
Rhi: Yeah, Seeks as a Poison-type trainer makes sense.
Minna: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] The quote from Waffles is “she would have adopted a Grimer or that new garbage monster, like whatever needed love.”
Josie: Why not both?
Kim: Whatever needed love. That’s just the Seeks MO right there.
Rhi: Trubbish is the name of the other garbage monster.
Kim: Trubbish! Yes, that’s the new one that’s just trash.
[laughter]
Rhi: I’m now explaining to Waffles why I have thrown—For what it’s worth, Waffles did not fucking flinch. I just messaged them out of the blue, “what type of Pokémon trainer would Seeks be?” “Ooh! Hmm…”
[laughter]
Kim: What about Nevan though? Did we figure out Nevan?
Rhi: No, I didn’t figure out Nevan. Well, I think that he has a bunch of Eevees.
Josie: [laughs]
Minna: Aww~!
Kim: Aww, yeah.
Rhi: He has an army of Eevees.
Minna: Eevees and Eeveelutions.
Josie: A good boy.
Kim: I was just gonna say, like whatever—he would just have a collection of Pokémon that resembled cats like a Purrloin and a Meowth, etcetera-etcetera, but I like the idea of him having a bunch of Eevees.
Rhi: I think he defies specific typing and just has an army of Eevees.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: I like that. I like that. He’s an Eevee trainer. That’s very good.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Josie: Including a Sylveon, because Sylveon says trans rights.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Yes! Yes she does. Do we know who would be an Electric-type? I don’t think we’ve assigned Electric-type to anyone yet.
Rhi: We haven’t.
Josie: Hmm.
Minna: Dowler.
Kim: Eh…
Rhi: Eh.
Kim: Well, lightning barrier as a smuggler… maybe.
Minna: It was a bad joke based on that.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: I mean, it could be that.
Josie: Fucking, um, what’s his face? The noble who helps us out, with the tea.
Rhi: Oh! He’s not a noble. Amancio, the deal broker.
Josie: Amancio. He strikes me as an Electric-type.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Aw yeah, he uses them to power his greenhouse.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah. I could see Electric-type for him.
Minna: What would the apprentices be? I’m suddenly wondering.
Rhi: Oh…
Minna: This is a bad. Wester actually might be a Fire-type.
Rhi: Yeah, or Fighting.
Minna: I would say Ojal is Fighting.
Rhi: Ojal is Fighting.
Josie: Clave comes across as Ice to me.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah, she’s Ice.
Rhi: All right. Thank you so much, Tyler, for this question.
[laughter]
Kim: We love it.
Rhi: This was a delight.
Minna: Very important.
Rhi: This was very good.
Minna: Very important character work here.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs] I still can’t get over the fact that I just messaged Waffles on Discord, zero context, and they just instantly were like yes, I will give this question my full consideration, I don’t need an explanation.
Josie: Waffles is a good bean.
Kim: Yes, they really are.
Rhi: Waffles is one of the very best beans. That was the last question that we had, so I think that’s gonna do it for Season 3.

## Bloopers [57:30]
Kim: For some reason I could just picture that as an Always Sunny title card, like the gang steals the New York Times.
[laughter]
Minna: Honestly, that would be fantastic, but also we would die.

Minna: You know it’s a heck of an episode when I have spicy cover identities open but not my character sheet.
[laughter]
Rhi: Hang on, I gotta tweet that.
—
Rhi: I wish I had asked Minna how long she was going to be gone for.
Kim (as Blaire): That’s okay, because now this is time for… memeing.
Rhi: Oh no. [laughs]
Josie: Oh God.
Rhi: Minna was the one who needed fish in a tube explained, so…
Kim: I know, but [mumbles] … This is feral silly-billy time is what I’m saying. I can ramble.
Minna: I return. What is feral silly-billy time?
[laughter]
Kim: Okay, you’re back.
Rhi: Uh, all right.
Minna: Is that every time with Kim?
Rhi: Pretty much.
Kim: Yeah.
[giggling]
Rhi: All right.

Rhi: Amancio talks like… Sonic, on speed.
[laughter]
Rhi: Why did I do that?!
Kim: Not exactly like Sonic, though.
Minna: Amancio’s the guy who makes weird tea, right?
—
Minna: I love how Blaire’s the only one of us who has parents and she’s the one who has adoptive parents here.
[laughter]
Rhi: Mm-hmm! Listen.
Josie: She has an abundance of parents.
Kim: Blaire Culhane stole my parents for political reasons.
[laughter]
Rhi: Oh man. I know at some point there was a joke that was like sometimes a family is a mom, a dad, a mom, a mom, a vampire dad, and a Whisper.
Kim: Do what you need to cope.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: A cat and a statue.
Rhi: Oh yeah, and a statue. Can’t forget Kevin."
"Bonus Episode: The Drowned Dreams Score Transcript","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly.
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. This is a very special bonus episode, unlocked when we reach 600 followers on Twitter. It features Blaire and guest star Seeks on a really cool occult adventure, set sometime during the couple months after Phin’s arrest and the Ink Row riot. Thank you all for listening, supporting the show, and spreading the word about us. It truly means a lot.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
## Story begins [00.00.41]
Kim: So Blaire is in The Nest in her room and she is doing a ritual of sorts. And the thing is, is that she doesn’t even recognize what the ritual is or what it’s for, but it’s almost as if intuitively she just knows what she’s doing, even though as soon as the symbols on the floor are scrawled in front of her she doesn’t understand what it is. It’s coming from a place that seems very right. And as she’s doing this, just sitting in her room and scrawling things on the floor, The Nest begins to crumble. The bricks are just flying off the wall piece by piece, one by one, until she is in just a very bright void, almost unnaturally so. It hurts her eyes because she has, like, never seen this intense natural light before. But she is standing in a white void and at her feet is the Void Sea.
It is actually unnaturally still, and it is just this black, mirror-like, reflective surface. And she is walking on it. And she’s not sinking. And then, just a few feet ahead of her the surface starts bubbling, almost as if there’s something underneath. And Blaire just moves forward and investigates, and as she does, the bubbling intensifies. It’s almost as if it’s growing more and more restless the nearer she gets to it. And she’s crouching down, she’s hovering just above it, and she puts her arms into the water, like, elbow-length deep. And she realizes as soon as she’s done that, she’s stuck. And after a moment the surface underneath her, it almost starts sinking. Almost as if there’s a valley formed before her. And it’s not until then that she realizes it’s not water that’s underneath her anymore, it’s these jaws coming up to engulf her. And then, just complete darkness. And that’s when Blaire wakes up from her dream.
Rhi: So, we see Blaire in her room, for real this time. This is probably about six weeks after the riots in Ink Row, a week or two after the remaining Magpies’ kind of botched attempt at infiltrating Lord Mora’s estate. And for the last probably week or so, Blaire has been having these dreams kind of along these lines, just sort of unsettling dreams about the Void Sea and things like that. After your waking up from your dream, what do you do?
Kim: So, Blaire is sitting up in her bed now and I think she’s just going to rub her eyes, because she’s very tired of this. She’s sick of it. She’s had enough at this point. Because weird dreams I don’t think are an unnatural occurrence to her, but this type of dream, of the Void Sea and just facing oblivion is definitely something that gets to her. It gets under her skin a lot. And I would say at this point she’s starting to get a little shook up about it. I think she’s gonna get out of bed and she’s going to walk to the other side of her room where her bookshelves are, and she’s going to start flipping through one of her books that she knows has information about the Void Sea in, see if there’s any correlations to any imagery that she’s seeing to any information in her library.
Rhi: Okay. So, in flipping through the books, you don’t really— like, you definitely don’t find anything about, like a bright light. That part is just kind of weird. There’s some imagery of, like, sea monsters and of course leviathans, you know, having great jaws that can swallow people whole. Leviathans can take out a whole ship. But nothing that really matches exactly the sort of things you’ve been seeing. And you also know, like, you’ve talked a little bit with Minx and Myra, kinda casually asking if they’ve been having weird dreams. And Myra had just said that she hasn’t had any strange dreams at all lately. Minx told you about a weird dream she had a couple nights ago where she was clothes shopping and the clothes all came to life and she had to fight her way out.
Kim: Yeah, that’s right. That’s how it’d happen.
Rhi: So, I think we leave Blaire on her just kind of continuing to flip through her books and trying to figure out something of what is causing this. We cut across the city to Coalridge, sort of towards the end of the day. The embers of the sun are visible above the horizon as it sets.
Waffles: And then a small hole-in-the-wall clinic in a back alley somewhere. Young kid is leaving, they’ve got, like, their arm wrapped in a brace with some seaweed sticking out and Seeks yells at them not to poke it and closes the door, and then goes and sits down in a rocking chair. And is just, like, very tired. And then looks at the small jar of money, because she doesn’t make any profit off of this.
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: Because she’s real bad at business. [laughs]
Kim: She needs an agent.
Rhi: No wonder she and The Magpies get along so well.
Kim: [laughs sarcastically]
Waffles: Yeah, no, this is her vice. Helping people.
Rhi: Aww.
Waffles: And it begins to rain outside and the rain outside is coming down in sheets, crashing against the cobblestone. The whirr of factory whistles and the sound of hammering steel can be heard just a few blocks away. Coalridge never sleeps. The fire of industry churns through people like kindling, and it cares not for the ashes it leaves behind. And then she’s outside, moon above her, and it’s snowing. The cobblestone beneath her feet turns to ice, and the canals nearby are frozen solid, the city silent. And voice cries out and the ice cracks beneath her feet. Her steps take her nowhere. There’s a person, face down, half buried in the snow, and she reaches out, turning the body over. She knows this person, but the name hides at the edge of her mind, inky and foreign, sloshing around in her skull, pouring out her eyes and flooding the street, drowning her in memories that she can’t quite place. And it’s dark. Frigid. And she sees herself reflected in a wall of ice. Shimmering blue light peeking through the other side. She’s so small. So very, very small.
[three quick knocks]
Waffles: And then she wakes up.
Rhi: As there is a knock at the door, startling her awake.
Waffles (as Seeks): [startled] Coming, coming.
Waffles: And she gets up an crosses over and opens the door.
Kim: And it’s Blaire at the door.
Waffles (as Seeks): Ah, hello Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi.
Kim: Blaire is hunched over and you can tell, even though her hair is normally messy and her makeup, like, for lack of a better word, makeup, hides most of her features around her eyes, you can tell her eyes are sunken and her hair is messier than usual. She looks kinda shook up.
Waffles (as Seeks): Come in, come in, it’s wet.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Waffles: Seeks will go behind her counter and pull out a small tea kettle.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks.
Waffles (as Seeks): Ah, yeah, no worries. Are you okay?
Kim (as Blaire): Um… no, I wanted to talk to you. I’ve [sighs] I don’t know, I think something’s wrong with me? I don’t know. I feel like I’ve been having trouble sleeping recently and I don’t know. I’ve been having these really weird dreams. I don’t know if you have anything for that?
Waffles (as Seeks): Uh…
Waffles: She had a little electric burner thing and she just clicks it off, and then is like:
Waffles (as Seeks): Um… no. But— but dreams… yes.
Waffles: And then clicks it back on.
Waffles (as Seeks): But I do have nice tea. I have nice regular tea for regular problems, and we will talk about dreams.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, I mean, I like… tea’s good. [nervous laugh]
Waffles (as Seeks): Tea is great.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I dunno, I… I don’t think anybody else in The Nest really gets it, so I thought I’d come to you.
Waffles (as Seeks): Mm?
Kim (as Blaire): Like, I’ve gone to Minx and I’ve got to Myra and I’ve gone to Phin—well. Mm. Can’t. Never mind. I’ve gone to Minx and Myra and I don’t think they really understand.
Waffles (as Seeks): Uh… I mean, tell me about your dreams. Dreams are important and not everyone can help. But, um, I have a book for this.
Kim (as Blaire): You do?
Waffles (as Seeks): Uh, maybe?
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Okay…
Waffles (as Seeks): I pick up things from Ojak occasionally, when I have the time. I get all my medical books from him, and I got some other books too because, you know, Mom didn’t teach me everything and there’s lot to learn. Here, yes.
Waffles: Thud, and this big dusty tome.
[laughter]
Kim: How thick? On a scale of, like, Yellow Pages to…
Waffles: Calc Two. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah, okay.
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles (as Seeks): [sings tune to herself] Flip, flip… do you think it’s prophecy? I think it’s prophecy. I am pretty sure it’s- because it’s, like, cryptic? Right?
Kim (as Blaire): I… well… what do you mean by prophecy?
Waffles (as Seeks): Dreams are prophetic. That’s the point of dreams.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh… I mean, not always. I don’t, I mean, at least I don’t think so.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh.
Kim (as Blaire): But I guess it’s possible.
Waffles: [laughs] Considers this new information.
Waffles (as Seeks): Mm…
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, dreams don’t always have to be foretelling some future events. Sometimes it’s just, you know, your head’s way of processing where you are and where to go. You know what I mean? It’s a little, I don’t know. I think of it a little more that way, I think.
Waffles (as Seeks): Hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): But yeah, maybe this is important destiny and I’m, like, destined for heroic sacrifices or something. The dreams always have to do with the Void Sea. And light. But mostly, I think, the Void Sea. Do we have anything on that in here?
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh, I mean, I know a lot about the Void Sea.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, yeah, me too, but…
Waffles (as Seeks): I mean I grew up there.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. So, tell me about the sea monsters. What are the really big things?
Waffles (as Seeks): Do you want big things, or the gods?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… that’s a good question. I guess start with the big things, because I know some of the big things, but nothing I’ve really turned up feels quite right to what I’m seeing. I think there’s a sea monster in my dreams, but I don’t, now that you bring it up, I don’t know if it’s a sea monster or if it’s a god.
Waffles (as Seeks): Hmm. Is it like… does it have, like, teeth?
Kim (as Blaire): Several.
Waffles (as Seeks): Okay. Um, well, there are sharks, and—
Kim (as Blaire): Well, no, this is not a shark. It’s bigger than a shark, whatever this is.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh. Hmm…
Kim (as Blaire): What’s bigger than a shark?
Waffles (as Seeks): Lots of things are bigger than sharks.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Waffles (as Seeks): Sharks is a good place to start though, because smaller than a shark isn’t that scary.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, I see, alright, sliding scale. Bigger than a shark. Go past, way, way, way past that. Way past shark.
Waffles (as Seeks): Okay. Um, would you live on it?
Kim (as Blaire): Would I live on it?
Waffles (as Seeks): Is it big enough to live on? You know.
Waffles: Stretches arms out wide.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… yes? But would I personally live on it? I wouldn’t like to, no.
Waffles (as Seeks): Hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, most of the time it kinda eats me, so I guess yes, I could live in it, or on it. In, on, I dunno.
Waffles (as Seeks): Does it say anything before it eats you?
Kim (as Blaire): No.
Waffles (as Seeks): Okay.
Rhi: So, Seeks, kind of casting back in what you’ve sort of taught yourself and what you remember learning from your mother, Tycherosi tend to dream a little differently than the rest of the population of the Empire. And for all Blaire’s skepticism, typically if somebody who is demon-blooded is having repetitive dreams, it’s a sign that something bigger is going on. Not necessarily a prophecy, but you sort of know the principle of “like calls to like”, so if there is a powerful demon active in the city, then this can kind of wake some things up in any other demons or demon-blooded people.
Waffles (as Seeks): I think we can do some tea readings.
Kim (as Blaire): You think that would help?
Waffles: I think she doesn’t even ask. I think she takes your teacup when you’re done with it and pours it on a plate. And I would like to roll Attune.
Rhi: Yeah.
Waffles: [laughs]
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, go for it. We’ll start gathering some info here.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, I do tea readings too, but I never thought they would help with this. I dunno. It seems this is a little bit out of tea’s league, you know what I mean?
Waffles (as Seeks): Tea always helps.
Waffles: I rolled a 4.
Rhi: 4, okay. So, you look at the tea leaves on the plate, and a couple shapes emerge. The first is a circle, and kind of unusually perfect circle given what you’re dealing with here. But you’re kind of looking at it and tracing the outline of it with your eyes and then you see that even though it is perfectly round, it’s not quite perfect. There’s a section at the top that is missing, so it doesn’t fully close. And then, within that, there is a sort of large head with its jaws open and the jaws are open towards that break in the circle. And you can, with a 4, you can ask some follow-up questions, if you would like.
Waffles: What does the circle represent? [laughs]
Rhi: So, you study it for a little bit and it finally clicks. You know of a cult in the city that follows the teachings of a forgotten god that they call The Broken Circle. You don’t really know a ton about what exactly they do, there’s so many little cults and forgotten gods in Duskwall that, you know, it’s hard to keep up with all of their belief practices. But you do realize, like, “Oh, Broken Circle, yeah, I’ve heard of that before somewhere”.
Waffles: Is that the cult that my rival is in?
Rhi: I don’t know, is it?
Waffles: It seems like a good villain. [laughs]
Rhi: That one’s up to you.
Waffles: Yeah, sure.
Rhi: Yeah, okay. What is your rival’s name?
Waffles: Malista, a priestess.
Rhi: So, yeah, that is the information that you get from your tea reading.
Waffles (as Seeks): Sounds like we need to figure out where Malista is. I don’t like her.
Kim (as Blaire): Who’s Malista?
Waffles (as Seeks): She is a follower of an old god and she makes fun of my spots.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, that sounds kinda racist.
Waffles (as Seeks): I thought it was just mean.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, it can be both.
Waffles (as Seeks): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): So why do we need to meet with a mean racist?
Waffles (as Seeks): Because of The Broken Circle and she’s— I don’t know anybody else. Do you know people in The Broken Circle?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… I did, but I think he got sacrificed, like a couple months ago.
Waffles (as Seeks): That is very unfortunate.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean it was his choice. Still kinda sucks though.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh. Okay. As long as he died doing what he loved.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I mean that’s how I think of it. But to answer your question, no, I don’t know anyone in The Broken Circle anymore.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh. Hmm.
Rhi: So, you have some information. At least assuming that you’re trusting the tea leaves.
Kim: Can I do a tea reading and roll Attune?
Rhi: Yeah. Are you gonna use the leaves from Seeks’s cup?
Kim: Yeah, okay.
Rhi: Sure.
Kim: Oh. [laughs] My highest was a 2.
Rhi: Okay. So limited information. You, following Seeks lead, you do the same with her leaves. And you study it for a little bit and you don’t see anything right away, and you kinda like shift the plate around, and then all of a sudden, like, this image of open jaws coming towards you kinda like appears in the leaves, but it also flashes you to the dream that you had and you jerk back.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna, like, jolt back in her seat. She’s not even thinking at this point. She grabs the plate and she hurls it across the room and it shatters against the wall.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh.
Kim (as Blaire): Sorry.
Waffles (as Seeks): No, it’s okay. I only had two plates.
Kim (as Blaire): I’ll get you a new one.
Waffles (as Seeks): No, that’s fine. I can find more. But what did you see?
Kim (as Blaire): [sighs] It was just more of the same.
Waffles (as Seeks): More jaws?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Waffles (as Seeks): Well, I think you need to stay away from jaws.
Kim (as Blaire): …But I like that movie [laughs]
Waffles (as Seeks): Nope, and definitely not Jaws 2 and avoid Jaws 3D like the plague.
Rhi: Yeah, so I think you had said, “stay away from jaws” and then we started doing bits. So, what do you guys wanna do next?
Kim (as Blaire): Guess we’re seeing Malista.
Waffles (as Seeks): Mm….
Waffles: Grimace.
Kim (as Blaire): No? We can think of something else to do.
Waffles (as Seeks): No… it’s a good plan.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, what about the leviathan hunters? What if we talked to them?
Waffles (as Seeks): I don’t like them.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, I kinda don’t either, but they’re on the Void Sea all the time.
Waffles (as Seeks): I mean, we could go to Jul.
Kim (as Blaire): Who?
Waffles (as Seeks): Jul. They deal in leviathan blood. I need it for some of my experiments and they get their blood consent-ly. Which is nice.
Kim (as Blaire): How do they get it consent-ly?
Waffles (as Seeks): You just ask.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, we’re gonna go see them. That sounds wicked awesome.
Rhi: Alright, so are the two of you setting out now?
Waffles: Yeah. Seeks is gonna run back behind the counter and throw a bunch of stuff in a bag and pour the tea, the rest of the tea, into a thermos and put that in the bag.
Rhi: The two of you set out into Coalridge. It’s still raining a bit, so there’s just kind of this, like, there’s always soot caked on everything in Coalridge, and now it’s all like wet soot caked on everything and it’s not very pretty. Where in the city does Jul operate out of?
Waffles: Probably over by the docks.
Rhi: Yeah, that makes sense. Blaire, you probably lead in a more circular way around, giving Ink Row a wide berth.
Kim: True, yes.
Rhi: And tell me about the place where Jul works out of. Where do you find this person?
Waffles: I think it’s like an old, like, run-down ship repair place. It’s pretty much just like a warehouse on the water.
Rhi: Okay.
Waffles: Inside there’s just a bunch of barrels and like, a small ship that’s seaworthy, but on the…
Rhi: It’s the kinda ship where when people see it you have to reassure them that it’s seaworthy.
Waffles: Mm hmm.
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: It’s got a small pump on the back and a big old canister, and enough room for one, maybe two people to squeeze in.
Kim: One of the hulls definitely creaks in the wind without anybody stepping on it or anything, it just makes noise.
Rhi: As the two of you enter the warehouse and pass this “it’s seaworthy, I promise” boat that is painted with runes and has some masks kind of along the sides, both inside and out, you hear a faint clattering noise towards the back of the warehouse. You hear a voice call out:
Rhi (as Jul): Is someone there?
Waffles (as Seeks): Hello Jul. It’s Seeks, Seeks and Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Hi.
Rhi: So, rounding a corner of boxes is a person with long, sort of flowing dark hair. Greyish cast to their skin. Gold face paint on their forehead and down one eye and on their chin. And they come around the corner and smile brightly when they see Seeks and:
Rhi (as Jul): It’s good to see you again, The Rivers Lost But Seeking. And who’s your friend here?
Kim (as Blaire): Blaire Culhane.
Kim: And she holds out a hand to shake.
Rhi: Jul reaches out and shakes your hand.
Rhi (as Jul): So, what brings you here today? I’m afraid I haven’t been able to make a trip out to make any further requests since your last visit, so my stock is…
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh, no worries. My friend Blaire. She is having dreams of open waters.
Rhi (as Jul): Hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): And maybe ocean, like, monsters. Maybe leviathans, maybe gods?
Waffles (as Seeks): They’re probably gods.
Kim (as Blaire): You think so?
Waffles (as Seeks): I mean, if it’s in your dreams, it’s probably a god. Isn’t that how dreams go?
Kim (as Blaire): Um… I mean, I don’t think so. We talked about this. What do you think?
Rhi: Well, make a roll of some kind and we’ll find out what Jul can tell you.
Kim: Do you wanna do, like, a team Consort roll?
Waffles: Yeah. We can do a Consort. I have zero dice, but I’ll lead it.
Kim: Okay, I got a 3. [laughs]
Waffles: I got two 5s.
Rhi: Okay, so you’ll take one point of stress, Seeks, and the result you get is a 5. So, we have a standard amount of information. So, Jul asks you to describe your dreams and ends up asking Seeks if she’s been having any dreams as well. And after you both have described your dreams they sit back and study the two of you and are like:
Rhi (as Jul): My sleep has also been troubled of late, though not quite so vividly. And you said that you saw something of The Broken Circle in the tea leaves, and both of you saw these jaws.
Waffles (as Seeks): Yes.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah.
Rhi (as Jul): I think that based on what I have heard from you and others and what I’ve seen myself, this is likely something to do with the great gods of the deep. Which is troubling. None should be so close to the city as to cause this in our kind.
Kim (as Blaire): Wait, explain that, though, what do you mean? Because this is, like, Tycherosi related and it’s deep water gods— what?
Rhi (as Jul): Uh, you would most likely know them as leviathans.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay.
Rhi (as Jul): They have a great power and influence over those who share in their nature, even in part. So, those of us who have demon-touched blood will be influenced by them. You don’t see many Tycherosi on the great leviathan hunter ships.
Rhi: And she kinda sneers a bit when she says that.
Rhi (as Jul): But as I said, they are simply too massive to approach the waters near Duskwall. None should be able to influence us unless one was close, but I don’t see how one could be.
Kim (as Blaire): It could be maybe a lesser leviathan, I dunno.
Rhi: Jul just shakes their head and is like:
Rhi (as Jul): They don’t really come in lesser forms. They are simply gods.
Waffles (as Seeks): [gasps] What if it’s a baby?
Kim (as Blaire): What?
Waffles: She grabs her cheeks.
Waffles (as Seeks): What if it’s a baby god? Gods can have babies, right?
Kim (as Blaire): Is that possible?
Waffles (as Seeks): I mean, anything’s possible.
Rhi (as Jul): It is, yes. That is how—I mean, they are immortal, but that does not mean that they do not reproduce. It’s just terribly uncommon and I don’t know much about them.
Kim (as Blaire): It sounds like the only possible explanation we have got here.
Waffles (as Seeks): There’s a baby in the city.
Rhi (as Jul): With the jaws, it must… your descriptions of it, from your dreams, a leviathan is all that makes sense. I just—
Kim (as Blaire): No, I agree.
Rhi (as Jul): There may be a young one near the city, yes. That is possible. I don’t know what that would mean, or what that has to do with your Broken Circle that you saw. I too have heard of this cult, but I know little of it.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, I guess that means we have to go to our next stop.
Waffles (as Seeks): [grumbles] Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): I know. If she says anything racist, I’ll kick her. Don’t worry.
Waffles (as Seeks): Thank you, Jul. Here.
Waffles: Reaches into her bag and pulls out two mangoes.
Rhi: So Jul, like, their eyes light up and they take the mangoes, like:
Rhi (as Jul): You are generous as always, Seeks. I look forward to seeing you again.
Waffles (as Seeks): Can’t wait.
Rhi (as Jul): Wonderful to meet you, Blaire.
Kim (as Blaire): Yes, you too.
Rhi: Alright, so the two of you leave the warehouse that Jul works out of. By this point the rain has let up and the clouds have started to clear. The moon is overhead, very large and bright and has what are referred to as its dimmer sisters, that’s where the gang gets their name. These two sort of reflections, echoes, of the moon kind of either side of it. Almost as if the moon is being refracted through something. But it casts a fair amount of light as the two of you come out onto the docks.
Waffles: Yeah, we can either talk to her or Prowl after her, if we wanted to collect information that way.
Kim (as Blaire): Idea. We can do both. We can talk to her, and if it goes poorly, then we follow her.
Waffles (as Seeks): Alright.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Waffles (as Seeks): Do you want to talk to her?
Kim (as Blaire): Um, I can talk to her, if you want. Do you wanna come with me?
Waffles (as Seeks): Okay, yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Alright. Smile!
Kim: And Blaire gives a very wide, feigned grin.
Waffles: Seeks does like, her best grimace-y smile and her teeth are all messed up. They’re like, sharp and all over the place.
Kim (as Blaire): Um, okay. We’ll work with that.
Rhi: So, where do you go to find Malista?
Waffles: I figure she is… what’s that fancy part of town?
Rhi: Brightstone.
Waffles: Yeah. Probably somewhere in Brightstone. She probably owns, like, a small clothing boutique in Brightstone.
Kim: Ooh, bougie.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. God, Minx has probably window shopped there.
Kim: Ugh.
Rhi: So, you arrive at… what’s the store named?
Kim: Oh, it’s gotta have, like a cult-y name, but like…
Rhi: Yeah, it’s subtle.
Kim: Right, yeah. It wouldn’t scare off, you know, customers.
Rhi: Yeah, it’s not just called, like, “Broken Circle Clothing,” it’s gotta be something… maybe like Circumference?
Kim: Ooh.
Waffles: Shattered Corona.
Rhi: Yeah, so you arrive her shop, Circumference. It’s a clothing boutique. And unsurprisingly, given that it’s like ten o’clock at night now, it’s closed.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh.
Rhi: It’s closed, but as the two of you are standing out there, looking sort of sad, you do see sort of in the back of the shop there’s a flicker of light.
Kim (as Blaire): Do we wanna be those people?
Waffles (as Seeks): I mean, we came here to be those people.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah but not… we were gonna be the people that talked to a cultist, not the people that show up to a store after it closes. I mean, are we animals?
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles (as Seeks): Hmm, that’s fair.
Kim (as Blaire): They have to close. They have to clean the shop and they’re going home like an hour from now. Do you know how late they have to stay there?
Waffles (as Seeks): That’s fair, we don’t have to talk to them.
Waffles: Turns abruptly. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: Seeks is convinced. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, so we’ll just wait here and then follow her out, right?
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh. Uh, yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. We’re not gonna be those people.
Waffles (as Seeks): Should we hide?
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, yeah. Let’s go to the alley. Let’s go the alley and just, I dunno, stake it out there? I’m not sure if she’s gonna come out in the back or the front.
Waffles (as Seeks): Okay.
Rhi: So, the two of you head over to the alley, which is like, the cleanest, nicest alley. They probably pick up the trash here every day.
Kim (as Blaire): I could, like, lick this ground. Do you think it tastes rich?
Waffles (as Seeks): Compared to regular ground, I suppose. It probably just tastes like ground, actually.
Kim: Blaire’s gonna crouch down. She’s gonna press two fingers into the dirt and then she’s gonna taste her fingers.
Rhi: It tastes like dirt. [laughs] It tastes, or, well, it’s cobblestones in this part of town, so like, it tastes like a road.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, no, it doesn’t taste rich. It just tastes like floor.
Waffles (as Seeks): Oh. I’m sorry.
Kim (as Blaire): I mean, not your fault.
Waffles (as Seeks): Yeah, but I mean, disappointing things are disappointing, all the same.
Kim (as Blaire): I know, yeah. I was hoping to be an aroma, you know? At least a little salt. I dunno. It looked very clean. I thought it would taste good.
Waffles (as Seeks): I mean… are you hungry?
Kim (as Blaire): Uh… No, I’m fine. Are you hungry? Maybe we get something to eat while we wait?
Waffles (as Seeks): Uh, here.
Waffles: Reaches into bag, roots around, pulls out a sandwich.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, okay. Do you wanna split that?
Waffles (as Seeks): Yeah, sure.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay. Thanks.
Rhi: So, the two of you are standing in this very clean, but not special-tasting, alley, splitting a sandwich.
Kim (as Blaire): Have you ever stalked a cultist before?
Waffles (as Seeks): Um… no. I’ve done a couple jobs with cultists. They seem like nice people, for the most part.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. I’ve stalked a cultist before. But it was not because I had any special interest in them, I was trying to get close with a cult. I’m not a creep, you know. She actually turned out nice. You know, once I got caught. But yeah, that went on for, like, months.
I was following her trying to figure out where the hell is this place, you know?
Rhi: Is this your vice purveyor?
Kim: You know what? Sure. This can be Aranna’s origin story, I like this. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] God, you fucking stalked this cultist until she was like, “What are you doing?”
Kim (as Blaire): This is a good sandwich.
Waffles (as Seeks): Thank you.
Kim (as Blaire): What’s in it?
Waffles (as Seeks): It’s got cabbages and fish and… it’s mostly the bread that’s good.
Kim (as Blaire): I can see that. Is it sourdough?
Waffles (as Seeks): I don’t know what that means.
Rhi: You’ve got, like, mushroom flour in these parts and that’s about it. But it’s like, it’s a high-quality mushroom bread.
Kim (as Blaire): It’s a nice rye.
Rhi: I don’t think you could have rye with mushrooms.
Kim (as Blaire): I don’t know much about bread.
Rhi: [laughs] So, the two of you are able to finish the sandwich before you hear the back door open. And then a couple seconds later you hear it close and you hear, like, keys jangling. And then you see a figure come into the alley and start walking off in the direction, like, away from you. She’s an average height, pale woman with bright red hair that is done up in a kind of elegant hairstyle and she’s wearing, you know, a very fine-looking black gown. And you can hear boot heels clicking on the cobblestones as she starts to walk away from you.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, so she’s a fancy bitch.
Waffles (as Seeks): Yeah, that’s her.
Rhi: So, if you would like to follow her without being caught, you will need to make me a roll.
Kim: Let’s roll Prowl.
Waffles: [sing-song] Let’s roll Prowl as a friend.
Rhi: You guys wanna do this as a group action again?
Waffles: Yeah.
Kim: Sure. Oh, I got a 5.
Waffles: Nice. I got a 4.
Rhi: Okay, so it’s a 5 and you don’t take any stress, because nobody got a 3 or lower. You’re trying to follow her to the wherever the cult is hanging out, right?
Waffles: Mm hmm.
Rhi: So, the two of you creep along after her, keeping to the shadows, ducking into alleys. She doesn’t seem to be aware of your presence behind her at all. After about five or ten minutes, Blaire, you kind of realize with a start that she is heading along a path that you kind of know. She’s heading towards Six Towers.
Kim: Oh. Okay.
Rhi: And then she kind of turns down another alley and the two of you see her— like, as the two of you turn into the alley, you see the top of her head disappear from view as she is descending a set of stairs that lead down under the streets. You follow her down the alley, down the stairs, and when you come down the stairs and, like, peer out to make sure that she’s not gonna see you, you are standing along the side of one of the canals that runs through and under Duskwall. You don’t see Malista anymore, but Blaire, you recognize this area. This is gonna lead to a tunnel that will take you into the catacombs.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh. Oh, I think I know where’s she going. She’s going to the catacombs.
Waffles (as Seeks): Ah, okay.
Kim (as Blaire): You cool with that?
Waffles (as Seeks): Yeah, no, there’s catacombs under Coalridge that I use sometimes. So, yeah. No, it’s fine.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay.
Waffles (as Seeks): Should we go grab some stuff before? Because I don’t see her. And if we’re going to explore, I need a lantern.
Kim (as Blaire): Oh, I have a lantern.
Kim: And she unhooks her lantern from her belt. And she’s gonna stuff some electroplasm in there and it’s gonna give off a yellowy-green glow.
Rhi: So, my question was do you want to continue exploring now, or do you wanna, you know, kind of transition into starting the score?
Waffles: I think this is the start of the score, right?
Kim: I was gonna say, this feels like a good transition.
Rhi: Okay. So, both have normal load, this is definitely a stealth plan.
Waffles: I’m gonna go ahead and mark one of my normal load for snacks.
Rhi: Alright. Okay, so now let me look at the engagement roll. Okay, well. The dice really like the two of you, because I rolled a critical for the engagement roll.
Waffles: Nice.
Kim: Woo! Awesome.
Rhi: I have never done that. Let me see what this says.
Kim: Oh my God, we have blessed energy.
Rhi: You’ve already overcome the first obstacle, and you’re in a controlled position for what’s next. So, the two of you head down along the canal into the catacombs. And you’re actually able to kind of move in very quickly. You’re able to catch up with Malista. As you’re following her, you see some light starting to fill the catacombs and you see her reach an archway where there are a couple lanterns hanging and a pair of people standing blocking this archway. And she gets up to them and says something and they step aside and kind of incline their heads respectfully as she passes and then block it again.
And so, Blaire, you’re just kinda like, “Uh, okay,” you look around and you’re like, “Oh, I know exactly where we are, there’s totally a way around.” So you backtrack a little bit and go through this other side hallway and you have to kinda crawl through a spot where the ceiling’s collapsed a little bit, but you’re totally able to just loop around the guards at the front of this little area of the catacombs. You crawl through and come up to another archway where you can see light kind of filtering through. You both creep up to this archway and peer out, and you see— I’ll put this to you two. What would be, of kind of a cultist hideout, what would be the most advantageous place for you to enter?
Kim: Hmm. I was picturing, like, the center ritual area, but if there’s already people in there I’m not sure if entering that area is gonna be best.
Waffles: Maybe there’s like a, um, maybe it’s a big old dome theater sort of thing that’s been sunk into the earth, built on top of. So we can enter up in, like, the rafters, almost.
Rhi: So, kind of like an amphitheater?
Waffles: Yeah, almost.
Rhi: So, would it be that you two come in to sort of the central area but you’re up above everyone else, so you’re got a… okay, yeah. I like that too.
Kim: A ceiling view of this sick-ass altar.
Rhi: So, are you had been going through the halls, you had to go up, like a couple flights of stairs. And when you get to this archway and look out, you are looking out into a large, circular room that does look like it was, at one point, possibly an amphitheater. There’s sort of these large, staggered, stone steps or seats kind of leading down to a central pit. Or, it was a pit at one point. Now it is about a 15 by 15 pool of water. And you can see there’s, like, stone scattered out across the steps, where it looks like something burst up from underneath, forming this pool. There are about half a dozen people in the room right now, walking around talking to each other. And you can see at the top of the amphitheater steps, painted in thick dark black, is a broken circle. And in the gap, the broken part at the top of the circle, is an altar that has been very finely carved of stone. And it has some candles on it, some vials, there’s a couple books, some other things on there that you can’t quite make out what they are. And as you’re both sort of looking down into this space, the water at the center— which you can tell it’s deep. It doesn’t have sort of that lightness that shallow water does, it goes down for a while. The water shifts a little bit. There’s sort of waves and ripples. And when that happens, everyone in the room freezes and looks at it and seems to be holding their breath, waiting. And then the water stills again, and they all kind of relax and, you know, a couple people shake their heads and are murmuring to each other.
Waffles: Seeks lets out a breath they didn’t know they were holding.
Rhi: [laughs] So yeah. That’s the scene you’ve got before you. And, yeah, no one has even glanced in your direction. Everyone is very focused on either the altar or the pool or each other.
Kim: Can I roll anything, like a perception or whatever, to gain anything about the water?
Rhi: In this case it would probably be Study because I already kind of gave you the Survey results, because you got a critical.
Kim: Yeah and I actually have two in Survey, so I’m just gonna do that.
Rhi: Or in Study?
Kim: In Study, yeah, I have two in Study, That’s the one I’m good at. Yeah, so this is gonna be a controlled roll.
Waffles: I’ll take a stress to give you a bonus die.
Kim: Oh, thank you. You don’t have to do that. I haven’t taken any stress yet. Oh no.
Rhi: What’d you get?
Kim: Um… my highest was a 2.
Rhi: Oh my. Okay.
Kim: [laughs]
Rhi: So, fortunately, this is controlled.
Kim: Right.
Rhi: So I think what happens is, Blaire you obviously get very interested in that water and you are staring at it, and you’re not really exactly paying attention to your surroundings. And you kind of move through the archway out onto the little bit of a balcony that’s out there and you get close to the edge of the balcony and your foot hits a loose rock that falls off the edge and kind of clatters. And you’re able to duck back out of sight, so either you have to withdraw and try a different approach, or you can continue to try and Study it, but it’s going to be risky.
Kim: Okay, yeah, no. I’m not gonna try anything. I’m not that ballsy.
Kim (as Blaire): I couldn’t see anything out there.
Waffles (as Seeks): Um…
Kim (as Blaire): What do you think they’re worried about?
Waffles (as Seeks): Probably what’s in the water.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, obviously, but what do you think is in the water? That was my implication.
Waffles (as Seeks): I mean, what do you think that’s in the water?
Waffles: Grin.
Kim (as Blaire): Uh…
Waffles (as Seeks): [whispers] Baby gods.
Kim (as Blaire): Hopefully it’s something cool. Maybe it’s a cool god? Maybe they’re cool. I dunno.
Waffles (as Seeks): It’s probably a cute god. Tiny baby god.
Kim (as Blaire): Okay, well if it’s a baby leviathan then yeah, that would be awesome. But we don’t know for sure.
Waffles (as Seeks): I can’t see what they’re writing.
Waffles: Seeks is gonna try and sneak up and get closer to listen in to what everyone’s saying.
Rhi: Okay. So, I will say you have two options for kind of where you wanna sneak. You can either stay up on the balcony overhead and kind of move around to get closer to people, or you can climb down and sneak around down on the same level as them.
Waffles: I mean, let’s risk it for the biscuit.
Rhi: Gonna climb on down?
Waffles: Mm hmm.
Kim: you have fun with that. I’m gonna take a point of stress and give you a bonus die.
Rhi: So, I think this is gonna be risky.
Waffles: Rolled a 5.
Rhi: Okay, a 5. You do it, but there’s a consequence.
Waffles: Thank goodness for that bonus die. 1, 1, 5. [laughs]
Kim: Ooh, you’re welcome.
Rhi: Alright, so I am going to start a clock.
Kim: No! [laughs] Stop it!
Rhi: Can’t be stopped.
Kim: No!
Waffles: Can’t stop, won’t stop.
Kim: I don’t want the clock.
Rhi: You are at 1 out of 4, Cultists Notice You. Cause there was that rock falling earlier, and then, like, there’s some weird moving in the shadows that hasn’t quite risen to the level where anybody’s gonna go investigate yet, but they’re a little more on edge. But you are able to—is there anybody, like, are you trying to sneak close to Malista? Or are you just trying to get close to a couple people who are talking.
Waffles: Probably Malista.
Rhi: Okay. She is over by the altar, holding one of the books in her hand and flipping through it, and is talking to a young man, it looks like he’s barely out of his teens, who as you get close, he is rambling on about how the ritual should be conducted and, you know, we need to be calling upon the power of the moon. And as he’s talking, she just doesn’t even, like, look at him. She’s just flipping through this book and cuts him off mid-sentence, like:
Rhi (as Malista): The leviathans have no relationship with the moon or anything out of the Void. If we are to manifest The Circle in our world, through the deep, not through the stars.
Rhi: And she just kinda rolls her eyes at him and goes to the book. And he just kind of like hangs his head and slinks off. So yeah, that’s what you’re able to overhear initially. What do you wanna do now?
Waffles: I think Seeks has their, like, back pressed to a column and is going to try and see if they can spot Blaire from here.
Kim: I’m still up in the balcony. So, I’m just gonna like, throw a hand signal. Like, yeah, I see you. I gotcha.
Waffles: Seeks points, like, behind them towards Malista, and then points at the hole, and then, like, does squiggly hands. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Blaire shrugs frantically like:
Kim (as Blaire): [whispers] What do you mean? What’s squiggly hands?
Waffles: Makes a grimace and does, like, big jaw with both hands.
Kim: Okay, does that means Seeks sees a leviathan or wants me to create a distraction, or what’s…
Rhi: No, I think Seeks is just being like, “There’s a leviathan in the pool”. [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): Oh! Oh shit, okay.
Kim: I want to see if I can explore a little bit and branch out, and maybe there’s… not a war room, but I guess like a library or information room, to see if there’s any plan lying about.
Rhi: You want to also sneak and see if you can find some more info?
Kim: Yeah, but I’m gonna stay up here for as long as I possibly can.
Rhi: Okay. Go ahead and make a roll. This is gonna be risky. I assume you’re doing Prowl.
Kim: Actually, I’m gonna push myself to get a bonus die because I only have one in Prowl. Okay, my highest was a 4. I’m rolling like shit tonight.
Rhi: Okay. I am gonna advance that clock again. So you are at 2 out of 4.
Kim (as Blaire): [groans]
Rhi: So, you creep along the balcony, but, you know, your boots scuff on the stone a little bit as you’re going.
Kim (as Blaire): [whispers] Dammit, dammit, dammit.
Rhi: And you curse to yourself [laughs] as you’re going. And some of the people in the central area, like, start looking around. And a couple of them take lanterns and seem to be starting to look around the area. They seem to be getting a little more alert. They haven’t seen either of you yet, but they’re starting to suspect that someone or something else is here. But, on a 4 you do accomplish your goal. So, you edge around this balcony for a bit until you come to another archway. And you peek in. This is another kind of section of catacombs. There’s like, the large sort of shelves where bodies would have been laid out. They have all long since been cleared out. And a lot of the shelves are now holding books and lanterns and runestones and various, you know, jars and bottles and, you know. It’s your typical occult library setup.
Kim: She is tempted to have a little stick fingers.
Rhi: I mean, you are a thief, technically.
Kim: And this stuff is so cool! She doesn’t have this.
Rhi: What do you wanna do now that you’re here? I will say Seeks, I think you were able to—because you know Blaire is there, so you were to watch her creep along and then she gets to another archway and goes inside and disappears. So, she is out of your sight at the moment.
Kim: Can I roll a Study to see if there’s any leviathan information laid about in this room?
Rhi: Definitely. It is gonna continue to be risky.
Kim: Okay, there we go. 5.
Rhi: So, you start pulling books off the shelves and looking at them and, like, flipping through. And probably about half the books that you pick up, more than half, have to do with leviathans in some way. And it’s not just like, some of them you recognize are kind of like the standard academic texts, talking about—
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, leviathans 101.
Rhi: Leviathans and how leviathan blood works and how it’s refined. But then there are things like, there are leviathan captain journals in here that like—
Kim: [excited gasp]
Rhi: They’re not published. These are just handwritten personal journals.
Kim: Can I take one?
Rhi: Yeah.
Waffles: You should take them all. Those are worth so much money.
Kim: I’m going to do that.
Rhi: Okay, and I assume you’re going to grab, like, three of the journals?
Kim: Oh yeah, I’m taking those journals.
Rhi: The other 40-50% of the books, they’re on a few different things. They’re on some different kinds of rituals, some of them are pretty old texts about some of the forgotten gods. You actually recognize one of these. It is another copy of the book that you stole from Arun the alchemist.
Kim: Oh, yeah.
Rhi: Some of the other books that you see here seem to have to do with summoning. Like, you recognize some of them as, like, “Oh, this is how you summon demons,” but some of them seem to be about summoning other things that you’re not familiar with. Stuff you’ve never heard of. And so, you’ve tucked three of the books away and I think you’re standing there. You sort of, kind of, forgot that you were infiltrating a cult hideout and your brain just went into library mode. And you’re just standing in the middle of the room in front of a shelf, paging through a book, when you hear a:
Rhi (as Voice): Who the hell are you?
Rhi: From behind you. You’re in a desperate position as you turn to see a person in just sort of like loose fitting robes that are in different shades of blue and black, standing there with a lantern in their hand and a hand on the dagger on their belt.
Kim: Blaire is frozen in position. She probably drops the book because she raises both of her hands and is like:
Kim (as Blaire): Uh, um, it’s… it’s Ectoplasm Girl season?
Rhi: So, I think on that we’re gonna cut back over to Seeks.
Kim: I tried to think of a Girl Scouts cult equivalent on the spot. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: Ectoplasm Scouts.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah, it’s Ectoplasm Scout season.
Rhi: [laughs] So we’re gonna cut back to Seeks. What’s Seeks up to down there?
Waffles: I don’t know, because the person she was communicating with disappeared. [laughs] How many cultists are down here?
Rhi: There’s five down here. So as you’re been kind of watching, the rest of them have started to gather around the altar and they seem to be sort of arranging objects on there. A couple of them have taken jars that seem to be full of what looks like black sea salt from the Void Sea, that are in the process of walking sort of around the edge of the amphitheater and then down towards the pool. One other person has a jar of white paint and a brush and starts painting a couple runes on the altar. It looks like they’re preparing for some kind of ritual.
Waffles: I’d like to Study it to see if I know what’s going on.
Rhi: Okay. Just the ritual as a whole?
Waffles: Yeah, the ritual as a whole.
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Definitely you can do that. It is going to be risky.
Waffles: Mm hmm. That’s a good old 1.
Rhi: Cool… where was that clock at? 2 out of 4? Let me take a look. Is it risky?
Waffles: [nervous laugh] It’s alright, I have an awful plan.
Rhi: Alright, well, guess what time it is, you guys? It’s time for that clock to hit 4 out of 4, baby. Seeks you’re trying to get a look at what these runes are, but you can’t really get a clear look from your position, so you move forward a little bit and you move forward a little bit more until the person doing the runes finishes them and, like, straightens up and nods to themselves and then looks up and looks straight at you. Like, makes direct, unintentional eye contact. And there’s a beat of silence while the two of you look at each other.
Waffles (as Seeks): …Hi.
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: Just little, like, finger waves. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. And then the woman who was doing the painting just yells:
Rhi (as Cultist): Intruders!
Rhi: And everybody else whips around. Seeks can act first, and then I’ll have Blaire do whatever action she’s gonna do. So, what are you doing now that you have been spotted?
Waffles: I’m gonna start off with smoke bomb.
Rhi: Okay, solid. Solid choice.
Waffles: It’s probably gonna be a Wrecking for a set up action, just to put myself in a controlled position. So, I’ll go ahead and roll to Wreck.
Rhi: Okay.
Waffles: And what’s a Devil’s Bargain look like here?
Rhi: Oh gosh. In the chaos that you are about to cause, the book that Malista is holding is going to end up probably in the water. It’s gonna end up destroyed.
Waffles: Well, I can’t be sad if I never knew what’s in it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Waffles: I’ll take that.
Rhi: Okay.
Waffles: I’ll roll my three dice. Yes! 6, 6, 6.
Rhi: [gasps] Holy shit!
Kim: Whoa!
Rhi: God damn. Okay, yeah. So, your goal here was to basically provide cover for yourself and Blaire, right?
Waffles: Yeah, it was to put us into a more controlled position.
Rhi: Okay. Oh, I think I know what happens. You throw this smoke bomb straight at the person with the paint who spotted you, and it lands in a jar of something on the altar, and whatever’s in your smoke bomb and whatever’s in this jar react in a really fun and exciting way. And it just fills the room. Like, normally your smoke bombs do not fill a room this large. But whatever this combined with, it has just filled the room with this thick… what color should it be?
Kim: Purple.
Waffles: Purple, yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, this thick purple smoke, that it doesn’t hurt to breathe. It tastes a little funny, but it’s not, like, burning your lungs to breathe, to move through it. But it just, like, billows out and fills the room very quickly. And there’s just, like, shouting and confusion and there’s a splashing sound and then there’s some like cursing and like:
Rhi (as Cultist): On no! Don’t disturb it, don’t disturb it! We’re not ready!
Rhi: And there is panic and confusion and so, Seeks, nobody knows where you are. Blaire, I am gonna say that because Seeks got three 6s, you are gonna be able to use, like, the smoke doesn’t reach into the library, but the explosion and then the shouting is enough of a distraction that you are gonna be able to run out and get away from this person.
Kim: Good.
Rhi: Basically as a freebie. You’re not gonna have to make a roll. So, you can get out to the balcony and the room is just full of this purple smoke.
Kim: Thank you!
Rhi: So what do you do?
Waffles: I mean, Seeks is gonna do a Prowl. You can use prowl for combat if you’re being sneaky and taking people out.
Rhi: Yeah, ambushing people.
Waffles: Assassin’s Creed style. [laughs] So, that is my plan.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I might try that after you. I’m not a punch girl though, I’m not very good at fighting.
Waffles: No, if this devolves into fisticuffs, I’m going to get my teeth kicked in.
Rhi: [laughs] Alright. Yeah, so I think what we see is Blaire, you’re up on the balcony kind of looking around and like, the smoke sort of parts for a second and you see Seeks down creeping towards a cultist with their back to her. The cultist is just looking around in confusion as Seeks does a sneak. So, go ahead and roll your sneak and yeah, you’re definitely in a controlled position.
Waffles: Nice!
Rhi: What’d you get?
Waffles: I got a 6.
Rhi: 6, okay, yeah. Those are some blessed dice.
Waffles: Oh, don’t worry, next roll it’ll be 1s and… [laughs]
Rhi: So, how do you take this person out?
Waffles: Seeks sneaks up behind, I think it’s the cultist who spotted me, because they’re closest, and they’re like, flipping back and forth and trying to find their way in the fog and Seeks just grabs them from behind and bites into their neck.
Rhi: Oh jeez.
Waffles: And—
Rhi: Are you trying to kill them?
Waffles: No, I’m gonna make them do a sleepy sleep.
Rhi: Oh! Right, you’re venomous.
Kim: Ooh, venomous? I didn’t know that.
Rhi: The leech is such a cool playbook. So, yeah. You are able to knock them out no problem. They go down in an unconscious heap. So, I think Blaire, you, like, the smoke parts enough that you see Seeks jump on this person and then it closes up again so you don’t see what happens, but you know that Seeks is sneaking down, taking people out. What do you wanna do?
Kim: I think I am gonna also to hop down from the balcony and do a Prowl and try to take someone out as well?
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Even though I am not a fighty person, I gotta do something.
Rhi: Yeah. It’s controlled still.
Kim: Nope. 2. That one’s gonna be banished as well. I have three dice left.
Rhi: Okay, you jump down and you start to sneak towards a person, and as you’re getting close they turn in your dirsection and you have to duck back out of the way so that you don’t get seen. So, as with last time, you can push on and attempt to ambush them again, but it’ll be risky, or you can withdraw and try and different approach.
Kim: I’m going to withdraw and try a different approach next time, because I think I have an idea.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. Then Seeks, what are you gonna do?
Waffles: I think Seeks pulls up one of their pants legs and pulls out a syringe. And we’re gonna say this one is filled with a spit mixture.
Rhi: Oh, okay, so trance powder?
Waffles: Yeah, so trance powder. And I’m gonna try and Prowl on somebody else.
Rhi: Okay.
Waffles: A 5.
Rhi: So I think for you it’s still controlled. So, you can do it with a minor consequence. I like having you end up in a risky position. I’m just trying to think of how that happens.
Waffles: I think, so I get person number two and then Malista has, like a candelabra and it taking swings at my head. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay, yeah. Yeah. Malista just kind of like jumps out of the smoke as this second person goes down, and takes a swing at you. Yeah. That works.
Waffles: Yeah, and I would like to resist the change in position. Um, like, ducking back into the smoke.
Rhi: I think that’s gonna be Prowess. Because it’s a physical thing that you’re dealing with that has put you in a bad position.
Waffles: 3. 3’s not bad.
Rhi: Okay, so you’ll take 3 stress.
Waffles: I’m about stressed out.
Rhi: [laughs] Okay. So yeah, you are able to dodge backwards and just disappear into the smoke again. So you’re gonna keep a controlled position. Blaire? You hear, kind of, there’s still yelling and running and shouting, and you also hear some, like, water sloshing sounds happening.
Kim: So, my idea earlier was can I just unleash a ghost in here and have it do the work for me? Because I’m not a fighter.
Rhi: So, do you wanna have a spirit jar on you?
Kim: Yeah. I always have got spirit jars on me.
Rhi: I will, yeah, mark a point of load to have a spirit jar that you can just crack open.
Kim: Got it. Should I roll Attune for this, since it does deal in the supernatural? Or should it be Command so I can be like:
Kim (as Blaire): Hey, take care of this.
Rhi: Up to you. You could do either one.
Kim: I think I should play it safe and go with Attune, because that’s what I have higher in. So, I’ll just crack it open and see what happens. Just unleash this Pokémon ghost type into the world. 6!
Rhi: Okay. So, you open it up and the ghost is barely visible with the smoke sort of drifting though it. And I think it just spots one of the cultists and just goes after him. I think it’s the cultist who was up in the library with you.
Kim: Okay, cool.
Rhi: It just sort of, this like, echoing ghostly shriek as it dives at this man, who lets out a shriek of his own. There’s just shrieking and disturbed smoke over in that area. So, three of the cultists have been taken down. There are still three out there.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: The smoke is starting to clear up.
Waffles: Okay.
Rhi: You’re still gonna have it as cover for a couple more actions, but it’s starting to dissipate.
Waffles: Well, it’s been going well so far, so I will mark another use of bandolier and try and take somebody else down.
Rhi: Are you going for a random cultist, or are you gonna go after your nemesis?
Waffles: I think I go for my nemesis, now that I know where they are. So, I’m gonna circle them like a shark. Two 5s.
Rhi: Okay. So, describe how you take her out. Because you succeed in drugging her and knocking her out. And then I will tell you what happens after.
Waffles: So, I think she’s, like, circling with the candelabra and probably cursing at me. [laughs]
Rhi: Mm hmm.
Rhi (as Malista): You filthy half-breed! You’ve ruined everything!
Waffles: And Seeks leaps out of the fog behind her just like [snarls] and sticks the needle in her back. And just, like, drags her off behind a pillar.
Rhi: The candelabra clatters across the floor, and as you straighten up and come out from behind the pillar you see another cultist, as the smoke has sort of started to clear up in the middle, has rushed over to the altar and is flipping open another book and kind of, like, leans over it and starts reciting something out loud. They’re clearly chanting something under their breath. We now have two cultists remaining. Blaire, the smoke has cleared up in the middle of the room, so you are able to see this person at the altar, and you are able to see the pool in the center. There’s a lot of ripples happening. It feels a little bit like the dreams you’ve had.
Kim: Oh no.
Rhi: Like, the water itself is quite dark, but you can see a darker shape moving in it, and it’s large. It takes up almost the entire pool.
Kim: What I think I will do… I mean, I’m definitely interested in the water. I wanna see what that leviathan’s about. But I feel like we should take care of these cultists first. I still have… is my ghost friend, is he done? Did he possess that one guy?
Rhi: So, your ghost friend has a new ride.
Kim: Got it.
Rhi: They have possessed a body and left.
Kim: Okay.
Waffles: [laughs] Just imagining, “Woohoo, I got legs again! Whee!” Does, like, the jump-heel-click and runs off.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: “I’m gonna have some chicken nuggets!”
Rhi: That 100% happens in the background.
Kim: I love it. This might be weird, but I think I’m gonna try Consorting, or at least Swaying. Some kind of social action with the cultist at altar and maybe try to get them to stop?
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Because I can’t fight. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, how do you wanna approach that?
Kim: I mean, I’m imaging this as I’m going to appeal to mutual interests in this case, so I guess it would be Consort?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: And what does a Devil’s Bargain look like for this?
Rhi: That ghost that you unleashed, who possessed that dude, that’s gonna cause trouble down the line. That’s gonna be a problem at some point. That guy’s gonna cause problems, and it’s gonna somehow get connected back to you.
Kim: Eh, I can handle it.
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Alright. I will take the Devil’s Bargain and give myself a bonus die.
Rhi: That’s the spirit! Oh, that was a bad pun, I’m sorry.
Kim: Eyy!
Rhi: That was unintentional. That was unintentional.
Kim: [claps] Good job!
Rhi: And I’m very angry. No, just don’t. Don’t applaud that.
Kim: Congratulations.
Rhi: Don’t. No.
Kim: Alright, I’m rolling Consort.
Rhi: Your approval fills me with shame.
Kim: Oh word, I got a 6.
Rhi: Yeah, so what do you say?
Kim: I’m basically just gonna run up to them and, like, try to grab their arm and be like:
Kim (as Blaire): What are you doing? Whatever’s happening here,
Kim: And she gestures to the water, she’s like:
Kim (as Blaire): This needs to stop.
Rhi: The cultist looks at you, looks around at the, you know, unconscious bodies of her fellows, looks down at the pool that is still, kind of, rippling and then just shakes her head and closes the book and is like:
Rhi (as Cultist): You’re right. It’s not time. There’s not enough of us to complete this.
Kim (as Blaire): If that things comes out it’s gonna swallow all of us whole.
Rhi (as Cultist): I know.
Waffles: “I know, it’ll be glorious” [laughs] I have a quick question. Can the last guy just, like, get up and run after one of us with a stick? Because I wanna spray him in the face. [laughs] There’s these old-timey, like, pressure cans, and I just wanna spray eyeblind powder in his face.
Rhi: Yeah. Yes, 100%, I will allow this. It’s very good.
Waffles: Just, “Argh!” [spraying sound]
Rhi: [screams] Like, falls to the ground, clutching his face. The other cultist just ignores him entirely. Is just like:
Rhi (as Cultist): Perhaps your appearance here wasn’t a curse, but a blessing. The time wasn’t right for this. We need to wait, let it grow in power and strength. And then the Circle will be complete.
Kim (as Blaire): Exactly.
Rhi (as Cultist): So glad you understand.
Kim (as Blaire): Of course.
Kim: Blaire does not understand.
Rhi: Yeah. [laughs]
Kim: [laughs]
Kim (as Blaire): But these things take time. You know that.
Rhi (as Cultist): Yes. Yes.
Rhi: I think people are starting to come to. Malista is still out, and this cultist kind of turns and claps her hands together and is like:
Rhi (as Cultist): Come, my friends, come. These messengers have given us a blessing this day. We were too eager, too quick. We will fall back and wait. Perhaps pass on what we have learned to the next generation. And when the time is right, the circle will be made whole.
Rhi: And there’s just sort of like a mix of murmured agreement and pained groaning as people are picking themselves up and helping up their injured fellows. Somebody, like, picks up Malista, because she’s still unconscious. And the cultist at the altar goes to start, like, collecting the books and stuff. Are you going to let her do that?
Kim: Yeah. Yeah, she can put shit away, that’s fine.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: I can’t tell her what to do.
Rhi: So yeah, she’s just gonna take that stuff and kind of, you know, pack it away and put it in a bag. And she calls out:
Rhi (as Cultist): Lucius! Lu— hmm…
Kim (as Blaire): Lucius?
Rhi (as Cultist): Yes, he oversaw the library. I’m not sure where he is. Hmm. Adric, Thena, pack up the library and make sure that we bring everything. We’ll need it to prepare the others.
Rhi: And two people, like, nod and kind of head of to go up toward the library area. You are welcome to interfere at any point here, Seeks.
Waffles: I would like to try and, like, swipe a journal or something off the altar while she’s talking to people.
Rhi: Okay. You’ll need to roll something.
Waffles: Finesse? [laughs]
Rhi: I would say yeah, Finesse.
Waffles: Oh, a 4 and a 5.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
Waffles: Seeks is actively whistling while she steps back.
Rhi: I think it’s gonna be reduced effect.
Waffles: Okay.
Rhi: So, like, you grabbed for a journal that had a bunch of loose pages in it, but the woman at the altar kind of started to turn, and so you were only able to grab, like, a handful of those loose papers. You don’t get the whole journal. But you’ve got some papers that you now have, you know, you’ve got both hands behind your back and are whistling innocently. [laughs]
Waffles: [laughs] And then I guess the only other thing I wanted to do while we’re here is Attune with the giant pool of water.
Rhi: Yeah… okay.
Waffles: I’m into making poor decisions.
Rhi: Uh huh.
Waffles: [laughs] What’s a Devil’s Bargain look like here?
Rhi: Ah. I mean… God. The first thing that came to mind is no matter what, it works. That’s the Devil’s Bargain. [laughs]
Waffles: Yes! [laughs]
Rhi: No matter what you roll, it works. You’re going to connect with it. You may not want to.
Waffles: I rolled a 6.
Rhi: Ah, fuck.
Waffles: [laughs]
Rhi: Come on!
Waffles: [laughs] A 6 and a 2.
Rhi: Fine! [sighs] Alright. So, yeah, you Attune with the thing in the water. I’m trying to think of what this… because usually, like, when people Attune to the ghost field, it’s a visual thing. This is an emotional thing. This is something that you feel as sort of an empathic thing. You can tell that its asleep, but it’s a sort of disturbed sleep. It’s the same sort of feeling that you get when you have a dream and you wake up, but not fully. And you’re only partly aware of your surroundings before you drift off again. And the next morning, you would have a hard time saying if you even woke up at all. And there’s a faint sort of feeling of confusion and fear, and then a few moments after you kind of reach out, there’s a bit of curiosity.
Waffles: I think Seeks will start singing a lullaby.
Waffles (as Seeks): [sings gently] Hush now, my sweet. Close your eyes, and sleep. Watching the waves, and diving the deep. Stars are shining bright, the wind is on the rise, whispering words of lost lullabies.
Rhi: So, as you’re singing, this quiet falls over the room. The cultists kind of stop what they’re doing and look to you. And the feeling that you get from the sleeping baby leviathan, this sleeping, young god, the fear and confusion and even curiosity sort of fade away. And you get this feeling of contentment before it drifts back into a deep sleep. And as you finish singing, the cultist who had been at the altar just looks at you again, like at both of you, and just sort of nods in slow understanding.
Rhi (as Cultist): Yes. It is not time yet. We will wait until it has called us. Until it is ready.
Rhi: And she kinda like, gives you sort of a very respectful… not quite a bow, but it’s like a fairly deep nod. And then she moves off to join her fellows as they pack everything else away and prepare to leave. So, it’s just the two of you left in this big empty room with a sleeping baby leviathan in a pool underneath Duskwall.
Kim (as Blaire): Where did you hear that song?
Waffles (as Seeks): My mother used to sing it to me.
Kim (as Blaire): It was really nice.
Waffles: She smiles.
Kim (as Blaire): I think she liked it.
Waffles (as Seeks): I think they did too.
Kim: I want Blaire to crouch down and just put her hand in the water. Like, very contently.
Rhi: There’s ripples that are coming out from your hand, but nothing else in the water moves.
Kim: Aww.
Rhi: And then I think we fade back to Seeks’s clinic. The sky is starting to lighten a little bit in that brief sunrise moment where the shards of the sun are visible, as the two of you return to the clinic. It has been a very long night, but you both are feeling for the most part a little bit better. Although perhaps also a bit unsettled by the knowledge that there is a young leviathan sleeping under Duskwall.
Kim (as Blaire): Well, I don’t think we’re gonna have to deal with that in our lifetime. They said that they would wait another generation.
Waffles (as Seeks): Mm hmm. Also, it’s sleepy. Like, eh. There are scarier things in Duskvol. There are people.
Kim (as Blaire): Yeah. People are the scariest part. Because ghosts and monsters, those can be predictable. People… people can like, stab you in the back.
Waffles (as Seeks): Mm hmm.
Kim (as Blaire): I need to go to bed.
Waffles (as Seeks): Yes, get some sleep.
Kim (as Blaire): Is it alright if I crash here?
Waffles (as Seeks): Yeah, um…
Kim (as Blaire): Is that okay? I’ll leave first thing in the morning.
Waffles (as Seeks): No, you don’t have to leave at all. Here, I have extra blankets in the store room.
Kim (as Blaire): Aww.
Rhi: And you probably have a few cots set up, since you’re running a little clinic.
Waffles: Yeah.
Kim (as Blaire): Thanks, Seeks.
Rhi: So, the two of you get to bed and you both have a deep, dreamless, restful sleep.

"Bonus Episode: Band of Blades","Transcribed by Michelle Kelly.
##Intro
Rhi: Welcome to Aldermark. Today, we’re stepping away from Duskwall and playing a newly released Forged in the Dark game: Band of Blades. The core mechanics are based on Blades in the Dark, but rather than being about criminals and scoundrels pulling off daring heists in a city, it’s about the soldiers of a battered, retreating military force, fleeing across the countryside ahead of an undead horde. It’s a dark military fantasy that sees players taking on multiple roles throughout the campaign.
I’ll admit, this is not a genre that I usually seek out, but one of my favorite things about RPGs is their ability to bring you into genres you might not have considered before, where you can tell the kinds of stories you want to hear. Kim, Minna and I had a great time with this one. If you’re into military fantasy at all, you should definitely pick this up. And even if, like me, that’s not usually the kinds of stories you’re interested in, it’s worth giving a one-shot a try. Band of Blades has a lot of really cool playbooks, moves and long-term campaign mechanics that set up groups to tell some really incredible stories. I want to say a special thanks to Sean Nittner for reaching out about this collaboration, and to John LeBoeuf-Little for GMing this one-shot.
A couple content notes about this episode. One, a general content warning for the whole episode for undead, actual dead, and some body horror. Two, I left in a bit more of the mechanics than I usually do when editing, in order to demonstrate how the new system works and how it differs from Blades in the Dark. And three, we played this game using Roll20, an online platform for hosting RPGs. The system worked really well. The built-in character sheets in Roll20 were especially cool.
Other Magpies announcements: First and foremost, our Shapeways store with Magpies pins is now officially open. I wanna say a huge thanks to James Bricknell for designing and donating the multiple 3D models that we used for the pins. Shapeways will be taking the majority cut of the prices, and any profit that we make form the sales will be donated to our monthly featured charities. Visit shapeways.com/shops/magpies-podcast to check them out, and that link will be in the show notes.
Our Patreon backer drive and contest is still ongoing. I have five 3D-printed, silver painted Magpie pins that James sent me, that I will be giving away to Patreon backers when we hit 100 total backers. We’re coming up on our one-year Patreon anniversary and we have a ton of great behind-the-scenes content available. Blooper reals, bonus episodes, in-character art and essays. It’s an awesome collection. There are also opportunities to contribute to the show by sending in Devil’s Bargains and NPCs. So visit patreon.com/magpiespodcast to back us, if you can.
I recently did an interview with the Too Many RPGs Podcast, and that interview should be live today. As soon as I have it, there will be a link in the show notes. I had a great time chatting with them about Blades in the Dark and the Magpies. Next, Kim is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Kim: The Rainforest Action Network’s Protect an Acre program works directly with grassroots and indigenous-led organizations to prevent vulnerable ecosystems from natural disaster and deforestation efforts. Since 1993, RAN has saved millions of acres of land and has collaborated closely with the indigenous communities who protect it. They uphold the values of fair trade, promoting the dignity and human rights of rainforest communities, and fighting against corporations who seek to disproportionately consume it for resources. Right now, the Amazon rainforest in Brazil is being intentionally burnt down with the intent of creating more farmland for cattle. President Bolsonaro has time and time again proved unwilling to stop the global crisis that is at hand.
Of the world’s oxygen that is not produced from the ocean, one third of it comes from photosynthesis occurring on land, and of that one third, the Amazon is responsible for nearly half. It is imperative that we begin and remain, louder than ever, on the side of science, the side of nature, and the side of indigenous people. To make a donation, visit www.ran.org, select support, and go to Protect an Acre. For a donation even as low as $20 your money will go directly to protecting an acre of rainforest land and to the people who are its closest defenders.
Rhi: At the time of this recording, the US House of Representatives has started the lengthy process of impeachment against the president, and information about the president’s efforts to use a foreign government to influence our elections continues to flood the news. For US citizens, it’s vitally important to contact your elected officials, no matter what party they are, and tell them you expect them to take action against the corruption and cruelty of this administration. It’s also important to check and double check that you’re registered to vote. This administration and their supporters in the GOP have proven that they have no regard for rule of law or democracy, and both are in jeopardy as we move ever closer to the 2020 election. So take action when and where you can.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story begins [00.05.51]
John: Uh, let’s talk about Band of Blades. This is a game about playing the Legion and members of the Legion as you’re retreating across Aldermark. You have been part of the latest offensive of humanity to deal with an ever-emergent undead threat that is to the west, and your last sally has gone poorly. Humanity suffered an overwhelming defeat at the hands of the undead, championed by the Cinder King, and are now attempting to regroup to the east. You’re going to bunker down in Skydagger Keep and hopefully make your way home sometime after the winter has thawed. So, this is a story about that group of intrepid heroes and whether or not they can make it to Skydagger Keep. Let’s talk a little bit about your characters.
Rhi: I can start, since I don’t usually get to play a character, so this is very exciting for me. So, I am playing the Scout playbook. My character’s name is Zaya Alikovna. She is from the Zemyati people, which is kind of, based on the description, sort of roaming clans that live to the far north. Prior to joining the military, may have been a thief. And my special ability is Infiltrator. I’m very good at getting past traps and security.
John: Excellent.
Rhi: Thus the “might have been a thief” background.
John: Right, right.
Minna: I am playing Mitali Dewa. She is the Officer playbook. She is from Barta, which is kind of their republic. They really value familial alliances and kinship. They’re a matrilineal society, it looks like, and a lot of contracts are sealed with tokens, which they usually have on jewelry. The special ability I chose is Tactician. You anticipate problems others would never see coming, and when you lead a group action you can suffer at most one stress.
John: Excellent.
Rhi: Very useful.
Minna: Listeners, I want this in regular Blades.
John and Rhi: [laugh]
Kim: So, I am playing the Heavy playbook, and my character’s name is Arun Arani. And he is also from Barta. The special ability that I chose is backup, which is when you protect a squad mate, resist with plus one dice, and when you assist someone, their pushes only cost one stress.
John: Excellent.
Rhi: Nice.
Josie: Cool. So, we’re going to play through the starting mission for Zora. Zora is the Chosen that is following alongside the Legion and keeping them from the worst of the undead armies. Chosen are essentially avatars of the divine forces that have been summoned by humanity to fight off sometimes supernatural, sometimes just overwhelming threats. This one particularly is from the Living God, Zemyati. Long ago, the Zemyati’s Living God created nine Chosen altogether, all at once. Which is unheard of. Well, it’s only been done that one time. Usually, each particular God incarnates once and becomes that particular Chosen. Instead, the Living God created nine, and Zora is one of those. The Chosen of the Living God don’t burn out or fade away, they persist until they finish some ultimate task. But they can be killed. They sometimes are. But Zora has defied even that expectation. She was supposedly tasked to deal with a problem in a kingdom to the west called Dar. She did that, she ended the God’s war, there are a bunch of things about her, we’ll get more into her at some point, but she is going to be the Chosen that is with the Legion. And we’re gonna talk about the starting situation.
With the crafting of black shot, the undead armies had been at a standstill in the western kingdoms. They were too well entrenched to attack directly, but they were held at bay by smaller and better-equipped forces. That changed at the battle of Ettenmark fields. That was the battle that you guys just had that went poorly. Now, the Legion has been shattered and the Cinder King’s troops now march east, bolstered with heretofore unseen horrors, to fight humanity. You Commander, the Legion’s Commander, was captured holding the retreat and taken to an Aldermani castle on the border of Dar. The red banners of the Cinder King were sighted entering the keep, and Zora claims a special interrogator was sent to turn the Commander with his mind intact. The Legion’s leaders have decided on one last-ditch rescue attempt. Castles are designed to keep people out, but there is a drainage pipe beneath the mountain that might provide a way in. Can you rescue the Commander before they are turned and all Legion secrets extracted from them? Can you take them out before it’s too late? Can you make it out alive? That’s what we’re playing to find out.
Rhi: So no pressure.
John: No pressure.
Rhi: Or anything. Like, yeah, just very chill and relaxing.
John: What’s gonna happen here is that there’s this keep. It has your Commander inside. You’re not 100% sure where they might be, but Zora is gonna assault the main gate, and this is going to take some time, and eventually she will be driven off because there are just too many undead for her to present a credible threat for too long. So, there’s gonna be a clock that indicates how long she has left. There is also an Alert clock in the upper left, and that indicates whether or not they’re hip to what you’re doing, right? Because you’re sneaking in trying to find your Commander, maybe rescue them, maybe just take care of them. The Commander, meanwhile, is being interrogated using supernatural forces and then will at some point break and divulge all of the Legion secrets to the undead, which would be terrible. So, there’s a clock in the upper right to track how far that is. So, this is the situation you are in. You, the three of you, and your squad of elite rookies…
Rhi: [laughs]
John: Which we’re gonna say—
Minna: The A team.
John: You have been assigned the… let’s say the Ghost Owls. So, I’ll just move them to the top.
Rhi: Aw.
John: Did you want a different one? I can totally do a different one.
Rhi: No, I like the ghost owls.
Minna: [laughs] I think that was a happy “aw”
Rhi: That was one of the names I was looking at like, “Oh, I like that.”
Kim: They go [ghost noises] “Ooh, hoo hoo!
Minna and Rhi: [laughs]
John: I could tell you a little more about them, if you’d like.
Rhi: Yeah!
John: Yeah, I’ll go ahead.
Rhi: Yeah, so we can be more sad when they start dying.
John: Absolutely. And who’s the Officer again?
Minna: Me.
John: Excellent. So, when people start dying, I will ask you to name them.
Minna: Ah.
Kim: Whoa!
Rhi: [laughs]
Kim: Why? Why then?
John: [laughs] Alright.
Rhi: Get a name list ready, Minna.
John: [laughs] Later this particular duty will fall to someone who takes over the Marshal, but for now, since you’re in charge, you are the Officer, you’re in charge, don’t know if that was clear, it’s going to be you’re job to name them.
Minna: [whines]
John: [laughs] Yeah, so anyway. Let’s talk about the Ghost Owls. Each of the squads has a little bit of history. When the Legion needs problems dealt with quickly and quietly, they send the Owls. They are traditionally stocked with Legionnaires experienced as special operatives, trained in infiltrations and extractions. A little-known fact is that their squad motto is an imperative, their squad motto is “Calm Before the Storm”. To always remain calm, regardless of the situation. Many Legion Snipers and Scouts were once Owls. Perhaps your Scout was once an Owl.
Rhi: Yeah. So, even more reason for me to be sad.
John: Yeah, exactly.
Minna: Uh huh. Mm hmm.
John: [laughs] Excellent.
Minna: This seems like the perfect legion to take with us for this particular mission.
John: Are you comfortable with the idea of infiltrating through the sewers?
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: We’ve done this. [laughs]
Kim: That’s my business shit.
Minna: This is unfortunately my go-to if you give me a keep that I can’t get into.
John: [laughs] Okay. So this is perhaps, in some way, comfortable ground.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah. I think when you all broke into Ironhook you went in through the sewers, right?
Minna: This is how we got into Ironhook, yes.
Kim: Yeah. I think we did.
John: Awesome, fantastic. Yeah, okay, cool. So, let’s set the scene. So, there’s rain and thunder, because there’s always rain and thunder outside as you’re sneaking into the sewers of a castle, right? So, the rain and thunder is punctuated by the howls of undead that are above. The rainwater is exiting this drainage pipe that you’re crawling up. Your Chosen, Zora, is leading an assault on the main gates as a distraction. This is a stealth and speed mission, so get in, get the Commander, get out, and whatever you do, don’t let the undead learn the Legion’s secrets. Do not fail. So, how do you proceed? You are in a sewer pipe.
Rhi: Well, I imagine as the Scout, I probably am ranging a little bit farther ahead of the main squad.
John: That sounds reasonable. So it sounds to me like you’re scouting ahead.
Rhi: Yes.
John: So, let’s make a roll. So that’s going to be Scout. You tell me actually, I assume you’re going to use Scout.
Rhi: Yes. [laughs]
John: Okay. I think that is a fairly standard— I think you’re in a controlled position, just for the moment.
Rhi: Alright.
John: With standard effect.
Rhi: So, it looks like I got a 5.
John: So, on a controlled position for a 5, you hesitate. Let’s talk about what happens. I think it’s not very far you get down the pipe before you hear the sloshing around of undead feet in the sewer pipe. You’re clearly not alone here. Can’t just range forward. You could continue to press on, but it will be risky.
Rhi: Okay. Or I can try…
John: Or just come back to the group. Or you can try a different approach, if you have something else in mind.
Rhi: Yeah, let me look at what I’ve got. I think I’m gonna fall back to the rest of the group and let them know. So, yeah. I will return to, uh… I gotta learn a whole bunch of new names. Mitali, and say:
Rhi (as Zaya): We should figure out how we wanna proceed here. There’s at least a few undead up ahead in the tunnel. We need to take them out quietly.
Minna (as Mitali): Yes, I agree.
Minna: Alright, how do I do this? [laughs]
John: This could be done a number of ways. I see that you could sneak up on them. I’m assuming that you don’t want to give up the element of surprise.
Minna: Yeah, absolutely not.
Kim: Not yet, no.
Rhi: So, in the sewer tunnels, is it just kind of like a smooth tunnel, or are there, like, nooks and crannies where people could perhaps hide, ambush?
John: Oh yeah, I absolutely think that there should be some crannies that you can stuff a bunch of soldiers into. Yeah, that’s fine.
Rhi: Okay.
Minna: Okey doke. Um, yeah, I think we should try and get in there.
Rhi: Yeah, if we can, like, split up along both sides and then just kind of jump on them.
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Sounds good. I’ve got a decent Skirmish.
John: Cool, so you’re going to lay a trap for them.
Rhi: Yes.
John: How are you going to get their attention to draw them out?
Rhi: I have a flare gun.
John: Oh.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: I was gonna say, I also have oil. So we could just light a fire.
Rhi: I mean… yeah, we could do that.
Kim and John: [laugh]
Minna: I’m good with either. I think you actually have more uses of the flare gun.
Rhi: Yeah, I do have four uses. A flare gun’s not gonna be super loud, right?
John: I think it depends on how you fire it. Let’s say no.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs] It’s just gonna be a bright light.
John: Sure. So, you set this thing. This sounds like you’re trying to, like, deceive them in some way.
Rhi: …yes.
John: Like, ambush might be some sort of… we could do this a couple ways, you tell me how you wanna do this. Like, what action do you think this is?
Rhi: Um… could I make an argument for Wreck? Because I’m looking at the description of, it does say careful sabotage, distraction…
Minna: Sow chaos.
John: I will say you can absolutely, you could totally do a Wreck here. Are you trying to do a group Wreck?
Rhi: Yeah, if this for the whole ambush, yeah it could be a group Wreck. Or it could be— I don’t know if people, if people— I don’t have anything in Skirmish.
Minna: I’m happy to lead.
Rhi: [laughs] You’re volunteering for that a lot. If other people have better rankings in Skirmish than Wreck, we could do that.
Kim: Um…
Rhi: I don’t have anything in Skirmish, but I’m—
Kim: I have 2 in Skirmish.
Minna: I also have 2 in Skirmish.
Rhi: Let’s do Skirmish instead, then.
John: Okay, cool.
Rhi: If we’ve got two people with two dice, me rolling 2d6 and taking the lower isn’t gonna be the worst thing.
John: Excellent. Okay, so you fire off the flare.
Rhi: [gun noise]
John: The undead that you’re engaging with are troops from the Broken. I should have talked about Broken a little bit. Let’s talk about Broken. So, the undead armies are championed by this one person known as the Cinder King. However, their lieutenants are the Broken, who are very analogous to Chosen. They are essentially, in fact, were once Chosen that have been corrupted by the forces of undeath and then turned into divinely powered monsters. The one that seems to be present today is Bone Render, or just Render. Also once a Chosen of the Living God.
Rhi: [grimaces]
John: Yes. So, uh, [laughs] So let’s talk about the troops for Render. The mainline troops for Render are called the Gaunt. They’re humans who have been desiccated over several months and then infused with Cinder blood, pumped back into them. And they have bolts, like, armor and plates bolted onto them. So they’re actually fairly heavily armored. They move slowly, though. They are obviously dead. They are reanimated after they, you know, had the metal fused to them. So, firing long range shots at them, not so easy, but setting up an ambush and then attacking them with swords, I feel like that’s exactly what you should be doing. So yeah, so these shambling undead, like, you can hear almost like a clanking sound as they come towards the flare and you see, perhaps— I would love the idea of maybe it’s a Legionnaire who was once at Ettenmark, that is still wearing some of the outfit of a Legion soldier.
Rhi: Ugh.
John: Right, like, comes forward, leading this pack of undead. And it is a pack, it’s like, five of them or so. So, let’s make some Skirmish. Who’s leading this action?
Minna: I am.
John: Mm.
Rhi: As we’re doing this roll, just a quick question, what position are we in?
John: Oh, yeah. This is definitely risky.
Rhi: Okay. How smart are these undead? Like, you know, on a scale from, like, your standard Walking Dead zombies to… [laughs]
John: Sure. So, undead have differing levels of intelligence. So that’s a given. More elite undead have more intelligence. Rank and file undead usually are given orders and can accomplish those orders within some broad interpretation. So, if they say, like, “Patrol this area, make sure nobody gets in,” like, that’s an order that they might get and they can follow. But they’re not super clever. They’re not going to deduce, exactly. Like, they might have suspicions, right, but if a bunch of them go missing it won’t necessarily be reported, you know what I mean?
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I have never been so proud of a 2d6 take the lower roll.
John: [laughs]
Minna: [laughs] Right?
Rhi: I got two 6s.
John: Wow.
Rhi: And I mean, you both got two 5s. We did very well.
Kim: Yeah, somehow.
John: As a group, you just nail it. Yeah, describe how you just take these people apart.
Minna: So, I think you shoot the flare gun and kind of run off that way, and then we’re both in nooks and we wait for the undead to come along.
John: And then it’s just one and done. Just basically super quiet, super effective.
Minna: Yeah. Like, the cover their mouth, like… I don’t know if slitting the throat works, or how you kill them?
John: Awesome. Well, however you, I mean, we don’t need to dwell on the exact details, but you basically [laughs] take them apart in some way. You don’t have to completely dismember them, but just destroy enough of them that they stop moving around. It seems to do the trick, anyway, unless you have black shot or black arrows, which are able to dispatch the energies directly. Yeah, awesome, great job. So, you’re still in the sewers, but I now imagine you trying to get up top.
Kim: Up top!
Minna: [laughs] Kim.
Kim: [laughs] Thank you, Minna.
Rhi: I’ll go back on point.
John: Excellent.
Rhi: I think for any of the undead that do have any, kind of like, Legion gear or insignias, if there’s anything that I can, like, take off them as here’s confirmation that this poor bastard’s dead, I’m gonna collect those.
John: Nice.
Minna: Aw, yeah.
John: You tell me. Does the Legion have, like tags?
Rhi: Oh, um…
Minna: Maybe they have, like, labels? Either over the heart or just sewn into their uniforms somewhere.
Rhi: Yeah. I like that it’s something sewn on that you can just, like, if you need to, you can just rip it off the uniform really fast.
Minna: Yeah.
John: Nice, like a patch.
Rhi: Yeah. And I think that, like, there’s kind of a standard insignia for your squad or the Legion, but then people tend to customize them in some way. Will sew little, like, charms or other little symbols onto them.
John: Nice.
Minna: Mm.
Rhi: So yeah, it’s a little more personalized. So yeah, we’ll collect those.
John: That’s fantastic. So, Mitali, can you name a rookie for me?
Minna: [groans] No!
Kim: [laughs] Aha, great!
John: This isn’t bad, like, this is a just a development of the story. I just wanna put a face on there.
Minna: Oh, okay, yeah. Um, let’s come up with a rookie real quick. Emerald Rushing Field.
John: Yeah, so Emerald Rushing, then. I think looks down at this particular undead as Zaya is pulling the patch off of their uniform. You can tell, Mitali, that Emerald Rushing is shaken. And they say:
John (as Emerald Rushing): I knew this guy.
Minna: I think I put a hand on their shoulder.
John (as Emerald Rushing): Is this… is this what’s going to become of all of us?
Minna (as Mitali): This is not what’s going to become of all of us, recruit. This is what we’re coming to stop.
John: So, now that you care about them [rubs hands together] let’s move on.
[laughter]
Kim: We’re fucked.
John: [laughs]
Minna: Yeah, this is not at all a terrible thing for the GM to say.
Rhi: Well, we’re probably not. [laughs]
Kim: Almost certainly, we’re fucked.
Rhi: I’m gonna file that away.
John: Alright, so scout ahead I guess, or however you wanna do it.
Rhi: Yeah, I’ll keep prowling forward.
John: Cool. I think, again, you’re back into a controlled position. We’re really just negotiating how much time this is gonna take.
Rhi: Oh no. I got two 6s, I suppose I was due. So, that’s a 2.
John: Okay, so this was a controlled position, so like, there’s only so bad it could be.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: So, I think what’s gonna happen first off is you’re going to get up from the sewers, but you’re not gonna be able to get out into the courtyard, you’re gonna be stopped first. So, as you emerge from the sewers, there is this booming of fire, perhaps even the thunder of siege weapons that are raining down into the courtyard. There’s various things on fire inside the courtyard. Right nearby where you are, there are large Heartless, and I’m gonna talk about what a Heartless is, as well as a number of Black Oak Knights, who are operating siege weapons of their own. So, what we’re gonna do is we’re gonna make some fortune rolls and see how the battle at large is going. And we’re gonna see how the Commander is holding up. Right, I’m gonna roll that right now. So, we’re gonna put a couple of ticks on this clock. So, the Commander is slowly breaking down.
Minna: [sighs]
John: It’s fine. You have plenty of time.
Minna: [laughs] I know.
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: I’m just worried about them. I’m not sighing at you, I’m sighing at life.
John: There is always some amount of emotional scarring that happens every tick.
John and Rhi: [laughs]
Minna:, I mean, isn’t that what we play RPGs for?
John: Right? [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
John: Okay, and then we’re gonna roll four dice to see how Zora holds up. Ooh, not so well. So, the undead are mounting a very solid retort to Zora’s flare and flash at the main gate. So, this is a situation, you know, things are happening. You see several crews of Black Oak Knights, who are human. They are not undead. They are one of the few actual humans to be working with the undead. And I don’t know how you all feel about that, but that’s a thing.
Minna: Not great. [laughs]
John: Not great. [laughs] That’s fair. As well as Heartless, who are sometimes taken from the ranks of the knights. They are giants, they’re essentially like eight, ten feet tall. They’ve had their heart removed.
Minna: [gasps]
John: Their chests are bare, you can see a giant hole where their heart used to be, as if it was like—
Rhi: Oof.
John: Yeah, ripped out of them. And they are plated elsewhere, they are plated in metal and they have giant weapons. Many of them seem to be moving large equipment across the courtyard to the knights, who are mounting an actual siege offense.
Rhi: And we don’t know where the Commander is, right?
John: You don’t know where the Commander is, and worse yet, you are in the sewer tunnels. There’s, like, essentially a cart right above the grate that you’re supposed to be coming out of. [laughs]
Rhi: Oh no, so I like poke my head up and it’s just, like, right over me.
Minna: Oh no.
John: Right. So now it’s like, “What do we do now?”
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yikes.
John: That’s the 1-3.
Rhi: Okay.
John: If you wanna say, like, “I don’t want that to happen,” we can resist, we can do stuff like that. But I think it’s a fun position.
Rhi: I like this particular inconvenience.
John: [laughs] Okay, fair enough.
Rhi: I guess I’ll whisper back down the ladder to kind of explain what is happening up here. That, like:
Rhi (as Zaya): There’s a big crate blocking the way, I—
Rhi: Is it, I’m guessing like, we could probably wriggle out one at a time, but it’s gonna be slow and kinda obvious.
John: Right. It’s gonna be a little risky, that’s really what it comes down to.
Minna: [laughs] Heavy.
Rhi: Yeah, I was gonna say, maybe does Arun wanna climb up here and push?
Kim: Yeah, that seems like something I’d probably do.
John: Excellent.
Kim: Just to, you know, carve a path for all of y’all.
Rhi: Yeah. I will climb back down the ladder and get out of the way so you can clamber up.
John: Awesome. So, tell me what you’re doing here and we’ll talk about what you should be rolling, if anything.
Kim: That’s a really good question, because I don’t know.
John: Okay, if you wanna just like, physically just be strong and push this cart off, we might have to talk a little bit about what’s required for that. Because it’s not really an action, but I do feel like that might be a roll. I would probably make a fortune roll using your prowess.
Kim: Yeah. That makes sense. What did that come out to be?
John: So that’s a 5.
Kim: Oh.
John: So I think here’s what’s happening. I think what you’re gonna do is you’re gonna heave really hard on the this cart, essentially, and you’re gonna topple it to one side so that everybody can get up. And then, essentially, you’re in a war zone, right? So I think you’re gonna all be bunkered down behind this cart as people are running from left to right and whatever you do from there, you’re gonna be in a risky position. Does that sound right?
Kim: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: So I just imagine Arun, like, crying out and heaving and then this cart toppling over, and then just the pile of you coming out, and then someone looks to the Officer and is like,
John (as solider): What do we do?
Minna: Okay. Let me think out of character for a second. [laughs]
John: Sure, yeah, take your time.
Minna: So, the situation— are there people, like, really near us?
John: There are a few people that are near you, but they haven’t seemed to have noticed you yet.
Minna: Okay.
John: A cart tipped over in the middle of a battle. It’s not super noticeable right away, but like, whatever you do, if you’re gonna try and dart across this cart, if you wanna sneak, it’s probably gonna be risky.
Minna: It seems there’s some buildings to our right. I think we’re gonna try and, like, duck into the shadows behind and between them, if we can?
John: Yeah, okay. That sounds fair.
Minna: So, I think what Mitali says to the group at large is:
Minna (as Mitali): Alright, scatter. Let’s get into the shadows behind those buildings over to the right.
John: Okay. Is this a flat run, or are you trying to, like, slowly, carefully Maneuver so that you—or Scout, rather, so that you cannot be seen?
Minna: I think it’s kind of a sneaking, careful movement, not like darting.
John: With carefully placed barrels, that are every so often, so that you can—
Minna: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
John: [laughs] Nice. Okay, it sounds like you’re doing some sort of group Scout roll.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I can lead. I have noting in Scout, but I can lead.
Rhi: Okay. I have 2 in Scout.
John: Yeah, another way to do this, if you think that this is more appropriate, you could also try saying this more about directing the people and you could use a Marshal role. But then it’s… it’s probably better to do the Scout, to be honest.
Minna: Okay.
Rhi: Alright. And this is risky, still?
John: Yes.
Minna: Well. I’m only gonna take 1 stress from that, because of my ability.
Rhi: And it looks like we got a 5.
John: Excellent. Again, on a risky, on a 4-5, you do it, but there’s a consequence. I’m gonna say that someone notices the cart that’s been turned over. You all file into what turns out to be a chapel. It looks like it was, at one point, a chapel. It’s now been sort of torn apart by undead. There’s no one in here, thankfully, but you do hear a human voice call out in Zemyati, so if you as a character, if you just tell me you understand Zemyati, all of you could.
Rhi: Yeah.
John (as Voice): Someone get that cart upright. What’s going on here? Why isn’t this where it’s supposed to be?
John: And I think what we’re going to do is we’re gonna put some ticks on this Alert clock.
Rhi: Oh boy.
Minna: That sounds about right. [laughs]
Kim: I fucked up.
Minna: I mean, technically I fucked up.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Well, I guess, no, we all…
Kim: It was a team effort.
Minna: As a group, we fucked up.
John: It takes a village. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. I feel like before we move around too much more, because this is a big place and we could be stumbling around without direction here, we need to try to figure out where they would have taken the Commander. [hums] Can I use my fine lenses?
John: Mm, yeah.
Rhi: This was a chapel, so is there some kind of, like, bell tower or steeple type ting that I could climb up to get a high vantage point?
John: Absolutely.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m gonna—
John: Do you have a climbing kit?
Rhi: I do.
John: Excellent, then yeah, this is not even a roll.
Rhi: Okay.
John: Yeah, so you just scramble up to the rafters and maybe look out from a higher position?
Rhi: Yeah, and I wanna just try and to get a lay of the land. Ideally see if I can figure out—I’m assuming that wherever they’re holding the Commander is probably gonna be more heavily guarded?
John: Sure.
Rhi: So, I’m gonna look for a place that has, like, an unusual number of stationary soldiers, given that there’s, like, a battle happening. If there’s a bunch of people being held back, that’s probably significant.
John: Absolutely. So, let’s say, give me a Gather Information with Scout.
Rhi: Okay. Ooh, when I Gather Info through clandestine observation, would that count as this?
John: That’s this. Yes, absolutely.
Rhi: Okay, so I have potency on this roll. 4.
John: So, with potency, because you’re real good at this, that’s good information.
Rhi: Nice.
John: Normally you would expect the Commander to be in this tower.
Rhi: Yes. [laughs]
John: But what you notice is that the Cinder King’s banners are actually outside a different building, on the ground level. This building is actually multiple stories, so like, you enter through the ground but there’s another story above. And you’re convinced that this is actually where they’re holding the Commander, that it’s not actually in this tower.
Rhi: Okay.
John: So, that’s the situation.
Rhi: Yeah. So, I will rough out a map for what I can see up here, and I will scramble back down and run over to—
John: You got a 6, though, so I actually think I’m gonna say one more thing, which is you actually see an undead— you think it’s undead, you’re not certain. You see what is essentially a large, larger than normal, knight come out. It’s like a knight, if you think of Game of Thrones, like The Mountain, right? This is, like, a huge guy.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
John: But you see none of him, right? You only see, like, the armor. Armor from top to bottom in this, sort of, Onyx-y armor with spikes in various places. Clearly a bad guy. And there is, like, a knight that’s there and you can’t see because— I mean, you can see, but you can’t hear, because it’s too far away and the battle’s going on. But the knight says something to this thing, and then gets backhanded. Just, like, hits him.
Minna: Oh.
Rhi: Oof.
John: And this knight flies maybe three feet. And you’re not 100% sure whether or not they are still alive, but then the creature turns to another knight, something is exchanged, and then it goes back inside. So, you don’t know what’s going on there, but you’ve seen this thing and what I can tell you is this is Cinder Guard, this is one of the personal guard that the Cinder King dispatches for very specific purposes.
Rhi: Like maybe interrogations?
John: Uh, you don’t think this would do interrogations, but it might protect the interrogator.
Rhi: Okay.
John: And just looking at it, you’re like, “Yeah, maybe we could take one of them with all of us.” That’s gonna be a tough order.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah. I’ll rough out a map of, sort of, what I can see of the courtyard and then scramble back down—
Minna: I have a question actually, really quick, before you scramble down.
Rhi: Mm hmm?
Minna: Are the walls patrolled? Like, around the tops of the walls?
John: you probably see a few patrols, but they’re not, like, they’re not anything worse than what you saw in the sewers.
Rhi: How does the courtyard look in terms of…
John: It’s a giant mess. If you’re not seen by the knights or dealt with by a Heartless, you might get caught with siege fire. It’s bad.
Rhi: Yeah. I’ll scramble back down and kind of report what I saw to Mitali.
Minna: I think you catch Mitali kind of whispering a blessing to whatever once ran this church.
Rhi: Aw.
Minna: And then she turns to you.
Rhi (as Zaya): Alright, so, it’s not the tower. There’s a smaller building, on ground level, we won’t have to fight our way up a hill, where Cinder King’s flags are flying and there’s at least one of the Cinder Guards in there. So, that seems like our target.
Minna (as Mitali): What’s our best route? Quietest. We don’t have enough people to fight off everyone in the courtyard.
Rhi (as Zaya): Well, I mean, it depends. We could use the battle as cover. There’s a lot of chaos out there, and we can add to it a bit, keep people from noticing us specifically. Or we could go up on the rooves and around the walls.
Kim (as Arun): If it’s more chaos that you need, I can help out with that.
[laughter]
Minna (as Mitali): That’s certainly true.
Rhi (as Zaya): Yeah, I feel like… I mean, there are patrols on the walls. There’s risks either way. But—
Rhi: What is the Officer’s title?
John: Oh. Um, it doesn’t much matter anymore, because there’s only, like, 50 people in the Legion.
Rhi: Oh no! [laughs]
Minna: But you know she insists on it. [laughs]
John: Whatever your official rank was at the time.
Rhi: Yeah, so what was your rank?
Minna: I’m thinking she’s Captain Dewa.
John: Okay, nice.
Rhi: Alright.
Rhi (as Zaya): So, what’s your orders, Captain?
Minna: Out of character, which one do we think is more fun?
Rhi: Ooh, more fun.
Kim: Chaos!
Rhi: Yeah, I feel like the more fun option is definitely going through the cluster in the courtyard, but…
John: [laughs]
Minna: Yes, this is the group that chanted, “Ghost riot!”
Rhi: Yeah, that’s… I will point out that is not necessarily in line with our “keep it quiet” mission.
Minna: That’s true. Our mission is kind of…
Kim: That’s a shame. Yeah.
John: [laughs]
Rhi: I’m personally leaning a bit towards the walls, because then we can go in— we don’t have to try to go through the front door.
Minna: Yeah, my thing is if we try to go in through the front door, we might have to fight the Cinder Guard, and if we go in through, like, a second-story window or something, if we try and go in through the rooves, that might actually put off having to fight anything. Or at least anything big.
Kim: True.
Rhi: Yeah. I mean, I expect that that Alert clock is gonna fill up when we bust in to grab the Commander.
Minna: Absolutely.
Rhi: We’re gonna have to fight our way out, probably.
Minna: Yes, but I think we need to conserve our strength.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I think we need to go up to the rooves, I thin that’s our best bet.
Rhi: Alright, I’ll rig up my climbing gear so everybody can, like, get pulled up the ropes or whatever to get up there.
John: Excellent. So, I think that sounds like you’re Rigging something.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: Are you any good at that?
Rhi: I don’t have anything in that.
John: Getting you up there is just a matter of, like, you rolling a Scout roll or something. Like, that’s fine. But if you wanna Rig up something for them.
Rhi: Right. Arun, do you wanna help me with this? Cause then I only take one stress if I push myself.
Kim: Sure, kiddo.
Rhi: [laughs] So, I would, if I’m getting an assist and I’m pushing myself…
John: You get two dice.
Rhi: That puts gets me up to two?
John: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. So, I take one stress. What position is it?
John: Hmm, what is the position here? I feel like if they weren’t alerted to the fact that there may be somebody around here, it would be absolutely controlled. I think there’s a question in my mind of whether this is risky or not. But I have to establish what that risk might be. I think you might get sighted by somebody.
Rhi: Yeah, cause I imagine this is not a fast process of, like, pulling everybody up these ropes.
John: Right. So I think maybe it depends on, like, are you gonna go slow? If you go slow, you can probably make this a controlled position.
Rhi: Um… I dunno, what do you two think? Shall we do this slow and quiet or fast and slightly…
Minna: I think slow and quiet.
Rhi: Slow and quiet? Okay, yeah.
Minna: At least for the objective that we seem to be going for, which is get in there as quietly as possible.
Rhi: Alright. So yeah, we’ll go slow.
John: Okay. I think what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna let you roll the Rig. You’re gonna be in a controlled position with standard effect. And then I’m gonna roll for how the front gate’s doing.
Rhi: I got a 6!
John: Oh. Wonderful. You put up exactly what you need to do.
Rhi: I imagine it’s like a pulley system where, like, Arun is at the bottom working some of the ropes and I’m doing the other ones at the top and we just sorta lift everybody up.
Kim: Oh yeah, that works.
John: It looks like you are about halfway down on the main gate. And then, perhaps a little more interesting, is this.
Rhi: Our poor Commander.
John: Your poor Commander … it’s just the first ten years of their life that they are no longer going to be able to remember. It’s fine.
Minna: Oh my God.
Rhi: Oh!
Kim: What?
Rhi: Oh no….
John: It’s fine. Okay, cool, so you create this scaffolding, essentially, and I don’t think we’re gonna need to make any rolls to see that people get up onto the rooves. You get up onto the rooves, but you have these patrols that you have to deal with. So, you’re about here, and you see a number of undead patrols sort of here and here. You have a couple of approaches available to you. Just let me know what you wanna do.
Minna: I will say that we have our Heavy with us, which means we could probably make work of some small patrols.
Kim: Mm.
Rhi: Yeah, let’s just sneak along the wall and then we can just… we did pretty good with that group in the sewers. I think if we keep an eye on where they are, we can try and set up some ambushes again and just take them out.
John: Excellent. Cool. Just gimme a controlled Scout roll, just to set up an ambush, maybe.
Rhi: Okay. Alright. 5.
John: I think you’re able to set up the ambush just fine, that’s all good. The patrol is coming along and I believe what happens in that a Heartless comes upstairs.
Rhi: [gasps]
Minna: No!
Rhi: Uh oh.
John: And then brings, like, another stack of undead. Essentially repositions a bunch of undead. So, when abouts do you wanna attack?
Minna: Yeah, I feel like we don’t wanna confront a Heartless at this point.
John: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Maybe not.
Minna: That could be noisy, if nothing else.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: He leaves the group that he was with there and then he leaves. So, you have about, I wanna say like a dozen of these Gaunt that are just spread throughout the area, and you’ve set up your ambush so that’s not really a problem. Call out individual— like, how are you approaching this?
Rhi: I have been, as we’ve been picking our way along this wall, there’s a battle going on, there’s lots of little bits of gravel and rock, and I’ve just been picking up rocks.
John: Absolutely.
Rhi: I’m just gonna throw rocks at them.
John: Okay.
Rhi: One at a time, to get their attention. [laughs]
John: You’re gonna try and, like, murder them one at a time? [laughs]
Rhi: I mean, I’m gonna try to lure in, like, small numbers of them by just throwing rocks at their heads. So they’re like, I’m figuring they’re not too bright, they’re gonna be like, “Huh, something hit me, I will go investigate,” and then everybody else can stab.
Minna: Oh my God.
John: Awesome. Cool. What action is luring in undead? [laughs]
Rhi: Let’s see… Shoot, maybe? Shoot a target with precision, make trick shots?
John: Yeah, maybe. Like, you wanna nail him in the back of the head.
Rhi: That’s kind of what I’m picturing, is I’m just, like, plinking their helmet.
John: Sure.
Rhi: I’m not gonna push myself on this, I’m just gonna roll it as is. Oh no.
John: [laughs]
Kim Oh no.
Rhi: [laughs] I threw too many rocks!
Kim: Baby, no.
John: Your intention was very noble. And you just, you nail one right in the back of the head, and I think it knocks something over. Like, I think that’s the problem, it is confused and sort of like— it knocks over a bucket that maybe you saw it there and were just like, “Well, obviously that’s gonna be fine,” but you hit it, it knocks the bucket over, a bunch of other undead look up.
Rhi: The bucket falls down a flight of stairs…
John: [laughs] Right. And they’re just all like, “Okay. That’s bad.” We can talk about resistances.
Rhi: Oh, hmm. Hmm. It’s so much harder to choose to do things when I have so much less stress.
John: Yes.
Rhi: You know what? I think I’m just gonna let it ride.
John: Okay.
Rhi: And we’re gonna [laughs] We’ve got some combat-oriented folks here, it’s fine. Let’s just see how this goes.
John: So, it’s a melee. There’s a bunch of undead in the area, they all turn to look, they all move as a pack, and so it’s like a phalanx of armored undead that are shuffling as quick as they can, which is not super fast, but fast enough, to come over to you guys. And you’re very quickly in the thick of things. I’m assuming that you guys are gonna draw weapons and just engage them at that point.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: So, that sounds to me like maybe a group Skirmish?
Minna: Sure. I can lead.
Kim: Yep.
Minna: What’s the position and effect?
John: It’s risky, because people might get hurt. So, I think you’re technically at limited effect. And the reason for that is that they outnumber you.
Rhi: Okay.
Kim: Oh.
Rhi: Could the Heavy use the Anchor thing? To fight as a…
John: Yes, absolutely. You can spend a use of Anchor. And then basically it’s standard effect and you just wipe the floor with them.
Kim: So what am I doing?
Rhi: Over next to the harm box, just to the right of it, there’s a thing that says Anchor. You can click one of those uses, and then you will fight like you’re a small group.
John: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Aw, good job, rookies.
Minna: They’re well-trained and I trust them.
John: Right? Has everyone rolled?
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Looks like Minna got a 5, I got a 5…
John: Yeah, and I think you guys just shine in that moment. Like, the Heavy is a massive influence on the battle and the rookies know exactly what they’re supposed to be doing, they’re all set up in the right spots, and despite the fact that this does not go off the way that you intended, it certainly ends the way you intended. And you just dispatch them all. So there’s, I think at a certain point you look up and the whole group is looking at each other and there are no more zombies. They’re all kind of in parts on the ground, and there’s a clear shot to what you now recognize as the former guard house.
Rhi (as Zaya): Nice!
Rhi: I’m gonna high-five the nearest rookie.
John and Minna: [laugh]
John: Yeah, who is the rookie that did, like, the best job?
Minna: His name is Gallant Elrik Garrosi. And you would think he’d be, like, a very confident, gallant person, but he’s very shy. Very few words. But he’s very good with a weapon sometimes, and he’s definitely blushing as Mitali congratulates him.
John: [laughs] Awesome.
Minna: [laughs]
John: Yeah, he probably says something humble, like:
John (as Gallant): I’m just doing what anyone would do.
Rhi: [laughs]
John: Fantastic. So, you guys make it to the guard house.
Rhi: Okay.
John: You guys are crawling through the catwalks of the guard house, looking down upon the Commander in a makeshift prison, surrounded by undead. So, good times. Let’s describe this prison a little bit. So, imagine if the main dining room area of a guardhouse was cleared out and iron bars of some sort had been, like, bolted together into a giant kinda cage, prison thing that’s maybe ten, fifteen feet on one side, right, so it’s a big cube. Inside this cage is the interrogator. The interrogator is this gaunt, tall, angular, pale creature. It moves in unsettling ways and it has really long arms. And it has these extremely long fingers on its hands and it seems like they are burrowing into the Commander’s head.
Rhi: [disgusted]
John: And this creature is, like, concentrating and attempting to extract the Commander’s secrets physically. Your Commander is putting up an incredible fight.
Minna: [whines]
John: It’s fine.
Rhi: [sighs] Yikes.
John: [laughs] That’s inside the cage. Outside the cage there is a smattering of Gaunt who seem like they’re waiting around to be ordered, there’s the Cinder Guard that you saw earlier. I’m gonna have you make a roll real quick. And that seems to be the sum of who the people are in this room, if you can call them people.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah.
John: I imagine that you guys are like, sort of on an upper level, looking down. So you can imagine that this is a big room with a walkway that goes all around it. This is like a facility walkway that goes to other rooms, that looks down into a dining area which is now a prison. Yeah. So, who was it that actually saw? It was the Scout, right?
Rhi: Yeah, I was the one that saw this Cinder Guard.
John: Can you give me a Gather Information roll with Scout?
Rhi: Sure, 5.
John: Great news. You recognize that the spikes on this suit of armor are not the same spikes on the last suit of armor you saw.
Rhi: Oh.
Minna: [gasps]
Rhi: So there’s at least two of them.
Minna: Oh no.
John: [laughs]
Rhi: Oh good.
Kim: Why?
Rhi: How delightful.
Kim: Why?
Rhi: How wonderful….
Kim: Why?
Rhi: … this news is for us. Yeah, so, there’s two of these spiky murder things.
Minna: At least two.
Rhi: At least two. Two that I have seen. Cool.
Kim: But why?
Rhi: Okay, I’ll relay that to our Captain.
John: Evidently the Cinder King really wanted this done.
Rhi: Yeah, apparently. Well, I mean, apparently there’s only, like, 50 of us left, so you get stuff from the Commander and that’s gonna finish us off. Okay.
John: It’s also possible that this interrogator’s just very valuable.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: So, what do you guys do?
Rhi: Yeah, Minna, you said you had some idea about a distraction?
Minna: Well, I can modify it.
John: I’m excited.
Minna: [laughs] So, I have this ability to use something called Channels and acquire an asset in a flashback.
John: Yes, you do.
Minna: I’m gonna go ahead and roll that and see how I do.
John: Cool. What are you trying to acquire?
Minna: A Orite clockwork creation.
John: Okay.
Minna: That should be able to be wound up and zoom away to a certain point and then make a lot of noise.
John: Okay, cool.
Minna: I’m gonna roll it and see how it goes, I think.
John: Yeah.
Minna: 4.
John: You’re gonna get it. I think that these are not normally found. This is, like, a very unusual item.
Minna: Yeah.
John: So, I think what we’re gonna say is this is damaged, or weak, or somehow insufficient in some way. And I would say that probably it’s just very fragile. So you probably don’t want to throw it very hard, but you could still get one.
Minna: So, I think actually I’m gonna take this fragile thing and I’m gonna climb down to place it.
John: Excellent.
Rhi: Oh no!
John: I love every bit of this.
John and Minna: [laugh]
Minna: And so, I think I only have to get to the base of the wall and set it on the ground and kinda wind it up, but I still have to get to base of the wall.
John: Sure. How are you doing that?
Minna: I think this is a Maneuver?
John: It sounds like a Maneuver to me, yeah.
Rhi: Do you want an assist? Because I’ve got climbing gear, I’ll help you out.
Minna: Yes, that would be nice.
Rhi: So, I’ll take one stress.
John: You’re probably in a controlled position right now. Like, they’re not really expecting anyone here.
Minna: Darn it.
John: Okay, so something happens. I think you’re climbing down— are you on a rope or something?
Rhi: I think that’s the assist is that I have a rope tied from my climbing kit.
Minna: Yeah.
John: Excellent. So, I think the thing is nobody ever looks up, right? And the undead are no exception to this. I think the Cinder Guard goes over to where you were coming down and it begins to acquire a bunch of materials that the interrogator wants. So, there’s like alchemicals, essentially, and we’re gonna say that there’s like a bench and various things it’s attending to, And you are hanging from a rope about a foot above it. So…
Minna: [laughs] Just gonna hold still and wait for it to turn around.
John: Right. Do you wanna continue along this road? I think it’s gonna be a little riskier than you were expecting it to be.
Minna: That’s fine with me.
Rhi: [laughs]
John: Fine, sure. Let’s make a risky Maneuver.
Minna: Okay…
John: You look up and you lock eyes with the Commander. And I want you to tell me the fondest memory you have of the Commander.
Minna: Augh!
John and Rhi: [laugh]
Kim: Wow.
Minna: So, I think I probably enlisted as whatever the rank below Captain is. It looks like maybe Major, from the book?
John: Sure.
Minna: I think my fondest memory is the day that the Commander raised me to Captain.
John: Oh, excellent. Are you still wearing the pin? Obviously yeah, I guess you would be.
Minna: Yeah. I think it’s just the pride, kind of, because it’s hard to earn their respect, you know.
John: Oh, they’re a bit stern.
Minna: Mm hmm.
John: Nice. Yeah, so there’s that moment of like, they lock eyes to you. And it’s almost as if you could see the, like, a conflict in their eyes of, like, they’re going through hell right now, but then they see you and you see that flash of pride as they look at you. Now you can make your roll.
Minna: I think Mitali does, like, as much of a salute as she can manage from this position. [laughs] Okay. Devil’s Bargain. What does a Devil’s Bargain look like?
John: So, the thing you’re attempting to do is to throw this thing and then have it cause it a distraction and basically lead them away, right?
Minna: Can I make a suggestion?
John: What’s that?
Minna: So, I think that the rope we’ve got, the reason that we’re having trouble here is that there’s not quite enough to reach all the way down the wall.
John: [laughs] Okay, that’s fantastic.
Minna: So, no matter what happens, I’m going to have to get on the ground, and no matter what happens, I’ve gotta find a way to get back up to the rope.
John: Got it. I love it. I love that to pieces. Okay, so you just don’t have enough rope. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Minna is very good at asking for consequences and then proposing her own terrible consequences.
John: [laughs] Ah.
Rhi: Just like, great. [laughs]
Minna: It’s fun!
John: That’s way better than anything I would have come up with. That’s great. Cool. Alright, so let’s have that be the case. So, you’re gonna get an extra die from not enough rope.
Minna: Come on, dice bot.
John: Oh, excellent. Okay, well you do it, there’s a consequence. I’m gonna say the Alert level goes up.
Minna: Okay.
John: That is very reasonable I think, you’re setting off a very annoying thing.
Minna: Mm hmm. Can I describe how this happens?
John: Absolutely.
Minna: So, I think she does get to the ground and she’s kinda crouched in the shadows. And what she has… I think we’re just gonna have a moment on top of the wall before she went down, and she says:
Minna (as Mitali): Sometimes you have to resort to childish tricks.
Minna: And so now she pulls something out of her sleeve, and it almost looks like a mechanical mouse. And like, you see her wind it up and place it on the ground, and it goes kind of skittering along the ground for about 50 feet and then there’s just this ungodly mechanical noise. Like, screeches and beeps and [laughs] as much horrible noise as a clockwork mouse can make.
John: I love the idea this is like something that Orite parents, or maybe even Orite grandparents give to their Orite grandchildren.
Minna: Yes.
[laughter]
Rhi: The parents through gritted teeth, “Thank you, Mom for this gift that I’m definitely going to smash with a hammer when you leave.” [laughs]
John: “Thank you, Lady Whatever,” because she’s gonna be noble. [laughs] Okay, cool. So, I’m gonna add two ticks to the Alert clock. That is not gonna fill it, it does have exactly one segment left. So, you manage to distract them. I can’t do anything about the fact that when this thing finds and subsequently destroys the annoying toy, then it’s gonna come right back here. So, you really don’t have a lot of time. But you do manage to get the Cinder Guard’s attention, and it storms off. What do you guys do in that moment?
Rhi: So, it pulled off the Cinder Guard. Did it take any of the Gaunt with it, or did we just get rid of the Cinder Guard?
John: I think it’s possible. Let’s say that’s gonna be a fortune roll. I think it’s, like, a couple dice. Let’s say it left a couple of Gaunt.
Rhi: Okay. The interrogator I’m assuming is some kind of undead.
John: Yes. Absolutely.
Rhi: I’ve got black arrows.
John: Okay.
Minna: [gasps]
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: I don’t wanna shoot him with the black arrows while he’s got his fingers in the Commander’s head, I feel like that’s gonna be bad for the Commander. But if we can pull him away enough and I can make that shot, I could fry him in one.
John: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah. So I’m thinking maybe if Arun and the rookies go down to deal with the Gaunt and, like, break down the cage?
Minna: I could draw off the interrogator.
Rhi: Yeah. I can just, sort of— I didn’t pick the Sniper playbook, but I’m basically playing one on TV. Try and take that shot to hit the interrogator with one of these black arrows.
John: Your mission is, of course, two-fold. One, bring the Commander back, or make sure that the secrets don’t fall into enemy hands. Worst comes to worst…
Rhi: Yeah. I’d rather not kill the Commander.
John: Yeah, no, that’s definitely…
Rhi: But I’ll do it if I have to. But I don’t have to yet. Does sound like a good plan to everybody, if we can just…
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Honestly, it works for me.
Rhi: Okay. So, I’m gonna stay up on the second floor, but I think that our squad and Heavy gotta jump down and— because we have to do this fast, we need to get back out before any of the however many of the Cinder Guards are around get in.
John: Awesome. You set up into a sort of sniping perch, nocking an arrow and training it on the undead interrogator. Does the rest of the squad come down as well?
Rhi: I mean, I think that’s up to either the Captain or Arun.
Kim: Yeah, I was gonna say, wasn’t the plan that I was going down with the guys?
John: Yeah, that sounds good.
Kim: The fam?
Rhi: [laughs]
John: You and the squad come down and descend upon the Gaunt. That’s gonna cause the interrogator to look up. If you have something where you wanna, like, convince the interrogator to come away as a distraction thing first, then we can do that.
Rhi: I think just kill a bunch of undead.
John: Yeah, that’s fine.
Kim: Yeah. Yeah.
John: Let’s do it. So, it sounds to me like you’re doing a Skirmish?
Kim: I would think so, yeah.
John: Because you’re using, you’re leveraging the rookies, right, so it’s gonna be a group Skirmish where you have equal scale. And I think you’re going to just be in a risky position because they might get hurt or killed. And we’re gonna take out a bunch of undead.
Kim: Yep.
John: Standard. Awesome.
Rhi: Nice!
Kim: I rolled a 6.
John: Like a boss. You do— would you like to describe how this awesome fight scene comes out?
Kim: I am just ploughing through these motherfuckers
John and Rhi: [laugh]
John: Mighty indeed.
Kim: Yeah. I’m dummy thicc.
Rhi: [laughs]
John: I imagine you, like, check one of the Gaunt across the room and then bisect another.
Kim: Yeah!
John: And then the rookies come out like a swarm and take out the rest of the undead.
Kim: Yep.
John: Are they only using blades? I think that is the real question here.
Rhi: I think we would probably tell them to only use blades.
Kim: Yeah.
John: Nice.
Rhi: We don’t want to draw more attention than we need to.
John: Yeah. Maybe there’s like, a cinematic thing where a rookie draws a pistol, but you put your hand over it, and you go back to—
Kim: [sings] Take the bullets out your guns, put the bullets out your guns.
Rhi: [laughs] Yes.
John: You just absolutely wreck the room. And then the interrogator is looking up at this, and then it curls up around the Commander.
Rhi: Oh, that’s the opposite of what I wanted!
Kim: Oh no.
John: And takes one hand out of, like, the burrowing, and around the neck. And you can tell that it’s basically like, you cannot, if you shoot me, I will kill this guy. There’s clearly almost like a detente.
Kim: Umm… we are at an impasse.
John: Well, it depends on how well you shoot, I think, is the real answer to that.
Rhi: Well, I…
Minna: Poor.
Rhi: Yeah, I was gonna say. Mitali, since you’re down there, do you think you can do anything?
Minna: So, a little background for me. What’s the leadership like in our army? Obviously, the Commander’s in charge, are there any other high-profile people?
John: Yeah. There’s the Quartermaster, there’s the Marshal.
Minna: What does the Marshal do?
Kim: He sends people to die.
John: The Marshal picked you for this mission, yeah. Is there something you know that I would love to hear?
Minna: Okay, so, I think Mitali steps forward.
Minna (as Mitali): You and I both know that the Commander’s a tough nut a crack. Wouldn’t you like to try your hand at an easier nut? Perhaps the Marshal of the army?
John: Ooh, very interesting.
Rhi: [laughs] You’re just trying to bluff into… oh my God.
John: Yeah, okay. I think there’s a moment where it, like, looks at you and is confused. And it’s like, I don’t know if I’m being sold a bill of goods here, what is this. Okay, so I think you have a chance to maybe confuse and/or delay whatever’s going on.
Minna: I would like to Sway.
John: Yeah, that sounds like what you’re doing, right?
Minna: And I would like to push myself.
John: That sounds like a good choice. [laughs]
Minna: Okay, and what is my position effect?
John: Hmm…. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: Is it… a desperate? [laughs]
John: That’s interesting. I think that your position here is tenuous at best. I feel like it’s desperate. You’re like, I want to offer myself up in trade, and the creature is like, maybe I can just wait for the Cinder Guard and I get you both. So, I think it’s desperate. You’re basically trying to— let’s talk about what your effect level is, though. Are you just trying to tell them, “Let the Commander go and I’ll come to you”? Like, what’s the…
Minna: I’m literally trying to get them to step towards me.
John: Just to step a little closer.
Minna: Yeah, just to step towards me. Like, I don’t even need it to be like a thing that they fully believe forever, just enough to get a little bit of distance from the Commander.
John: I think you have enough effect for that. Yeah, for sure. But I do think it’s desperate, because I doesn’t really trust you.
Minna: So desperate, standard.
John: Yeah, I think desperate standard is what we’re talking.
Minna: And I have one bonus die.
Rhi: Can I aid?
John: Yes, absolutely you can aid.
Minna: Please. [gasp] Just shout out, “Marshal!” [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I do:
Rhi (as Zaya): Marshal, no!
[laughter]
John: Fantastic.
Rhi: Yeah, I’ll take that one point of stress. Because I really want this to work.
Minna: 5?
John: 5.
Kim: Wow.
John: Well, the good news is you do it.
Minna: Uh huh?
John: The bad news is there is a severe consequence. I think you’re just a little closer than you intended to be, and it reaches out with its unpossible, like, long hands, and it manages to get its fingers onto your skull.
Minna: Yes!
John: [laughs]
Kim: Minna, no!
John: It stretches out and that’s why it stepped away from the Commander for a bit, because it still has, like, a finger or two in the Commander’s skull, and then it has a finger or two in your skull. And it’s trying to, like, grab you both.
Rhi: This is the worst! This is not what I wanted!
Kim: It’s the opposite of what we wanted.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Sorry. [laughs]
Rhi: It’s okay.
John: Well, the good news it you have an entirely clean shot on it.
Rhi: [sighs] Yeah, I gotta take it.
John: But before that happens, I should also do the other stuff. So, you’re gonna take some corruption here. I think that when an undead creature jams its bony hand into your head, starts raiding your thoughts, it probably corrupts you.
Minna: Yeah.
John: Right? And it’s desperate, so I think it’s 3 corruption.
Minna: Nice.
John: You’re like, “Yeah, that’s fine, it’s great.” [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Minna: It’s a one-shot!
John: So, I think there’s that. And then of course the consequence of now it’s got its hands inside your head.
Minna: So, what happens when this thing sticks its hand into my skull?
John: I think there’s a lot of cool things that happen. There’s two things really important. One is, I’m gonna say that you forget something. You can tell me what it is that you forget. And I think that something else is you remember chunks of the Commander’s life.
Rhi: Ooh.
John: Because, like, it’s never done this before. So I think it’s become a conduit of memories.
Minna: I think what happens is that it plays through a few things related to the Commander’s time as a soldier, including losing someone very important to them. I think at some point it, like, stops on one of the Commander’s promotions and I forget that moment with the Commander when I was promoted to Captain.
Rhi: Aww.
John: Oh! [cringes] I love it. I love it so good. [laughs]
Rhi: [pained] Oh.
John: Yeah, okay. Cool.
Rhi: I’m gonna take my shot…
John and Minna: [laugh]
John: Before you take your shot.
Rhi: Yeah?
John: I wanna hear a story about you and the Commander, like, tell me why the Commander is important to you personally.
Rhi: I think that I am of the Zemyati, but I grew up with them but I didn’t stay there. I didn’t fit in well and that’s how I ended up as a, quote, “retrieval specialist” in one of the cities. And I think that I ended up in the army as kind of a, like, you can go to jail or you can do a term of service. So, I came in with kind of a bad reputation. And I think that the Commander was one of the first people in command who trusted me.
John: Nice.
Rhi: They started giving me, like, solo missions without someone watching me. They were not, like, I think that a lot of my initial commanding officers would frisk me to make sure I hadn’t lifted stuff, and I think they put a stop to that. I think that they, once they saw that I had proved myself to be a good soldier, that was all that they needed.
John: Nice. Cool.
Rhi: I’ve made myself sad.
John: There you go. Take a shot.
Rhi: Yeah, alright, okay. So, I am going to push myself, which leaves me with one dot of stress left. Oh, unless…
Kim: Unless…
Rhi: Is there a way that I could get an aid from Arun?
John: Oh yeah.
Kim: Of course.
Rhi: Okay. So that’s gonna give me, if this is Shoot, that’s gonna give me three. Position and effect?
John: Feels risky to me. Where the risk is probably some sort of backlash on your friends.
Rhi: Yep.
John: And I feel like you have, I mean, you have black shot arrows, right? Black arrows?
Rhi: Yeah.
John: So I feel like you have greater effect. One arrow is enough, if you can just land the arrow.
Rhi: Yeah. And then I get two extra dice… yeah, I’m so nervous right now.
John: Right?
Kim: Oh…
Rhi: Oh, sure! Critical! [laughs and claps hands]
John: Oh dang.
Rhi: [relieved sigh]
Minna: Yes!
Rhi: Oh, the dice could not have done better for me in that moment.
John: Wow. I’m thrilled.
Rhi: [laughs]
John: I think, phew, you—
Rhi: That’s awesome.
John: Yeah. You plug it straight into the center of mass and then there’s this eruption of green fire, and it releases both of them and then gabs its chest, and then falls back and bursts into green fire. Wow. I feel like that’s… you just do it. You do it with greater effect, but like, you just get it done. I think it probably burns faster than you expected, like it burns to ash in a moment. That’s when you head the thundering of the Cider Guard in the background, so what do you guys do in that moment?
Rhi: Uh… well…
John: I think the rookies are probably scrambling and then barring the door.
Rhi: We need to get the Commander out of the cage.
John: Sure.
Kim: I’m probably the only one who can carry him, I think.
Minna: Yeah, I was gonna say, Arun can you carry him?
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, well we gotta— I imagine that the cage, I mean, is the cage locked?
John: Well, you have a wrecking kit and you have Arun, so you just smash the lock and it’s good.
Kim: Arun smash.
John: [laughs] Right.
Rhi: Yay.
John: And then yeah, the Commander is, like, barely conscious, maybe drooling a little bit, and just like, really out of it. But you’re able to, like, I guess fireman carry or something. So yeah, cool. So, you all, what do you do?
Rhi: What exits are available to us?
John: Well, so here’s the problem, right. You don’t actually have enough rope. [laughs]
Rhi: Yep.
Minna: Sorry. [laughs]
Rhi: No, no that’s fine.
Minna: But I think we can get up to that gallery, because didn’t Arun come down? There’s stairs, that we can—
John: Oh, absolutely. There are totally stairs. But, I mean, there is that big door where you would go through to get out to the stairs.
Rhi: Oh, okay.
John: There might be other passageways, like, through the kitchens or something. Like, maybe you could just keep going somewhere, try and meet up.
Minna: I feel like we try and get out the other side, like, outside the walls. They clearly at one point, there were doors that way, because there’s a road that comes through.
John: There is a road that comes through there.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: So you wanna try and exit through there. Alright, well I am gonna make a couple of rolls. I wanna see how the main gate is doing. The Alert clock isn’t gonna go anywhere, the Commander’s clock is halted. And then I think we’re just gonna see how Zora’s doing. Oh. It’s… she only has a little bit more in her. So, you guys are gonna bolt through the kitchens and the back passages and try and get to the rear exit of the guardhouse. There are undead all along the way. I’m assuming that there is gonna be some place that you can, like, link up so the Scout can rejoin the group. That’s not a problem.
Rhi: Yeah. I would like to, though, if I can, since I’m still kind of up and have more of a vantage point, if I can get somewhere to like… I wanna know what’s gonna be on the other side of the door that we’re gonna come crashing through out onto this road. I wanna know what we’re gonna be dealing with. So if I can find, like, a window, or a ledge overlooking.
John: Yes, absolutely. Give me a roll.
Rhi: Okay. Is this gonna be a Gather Info, or a regular roll?
John: I think this is a controlled Scout.
Rhi: Okay. 6.
John: Excellent yes. Absolutely.
Kim: Woo!
John: Yeah, no, just like you expected, the other Cinder Guard is at the front.
Rhi: Oh, okay. Well, so—
John: One here, one here.
Rhi: That’s… okay.
John: So, good job. Before things got exciting, you managed to identify that there is gonna be this problem.
Rhi: Okay. Yeah, so I’m gonna see that, and then I’m gonna, like, sprint down to where the rest of the group is. I think we designated, like, I imagine one of you shouted up like, “Meet us in the kitchen!”
John: Right.
Rhi: And so we all— I, like, come skidding into the room and it’s like:
Rhi (as Zaya): Okay, we have a problem. Cinder Guard on both doors, either way out from this level.
Minna (as Mitali): Ah… okay.
John: So, during this conversation, there is a big giant thudding as the other Cinder Guard is beating on that door.
Rhi: Either we try to sprint past one, get out to the road and hope we can make a run for it, or try to find a way back up to the rooves and the walls.
Minna: So, getting back up to the roof. That would involve having to get up to the second story. We still have to go past a Cinder Guard for that, right?
John: No, I think you can avoid the Cinder Guard. You’re able to get basically out back onto the wall, if you go back the way you came. So, maybe a little bit of a detour, because you’ll still have to go all the ay along the wall and then figure out a way to get back into the sewer tunnels and out that way.
Minna: Or, you know, try and figure out a way to get down from the wall to somewhere on the other side.
John: You could do that. That would be very exciting.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, I like that. Just putting some distance between us and the Cinder Guards. Yeah.
John: Alright, so you retreat back the way you came, and you’re back out on the… I guess, are they parapets? I feel like they are. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I think that’s the word.
John: Yes. Out onto the parapets. It looks like thing have calmed down in the courtyard as you emerge with the Commander over your shoulders. Things have calmed down quite a bit in the courtyard, and it looks like they’ve set up a crisp defense, where the knights are calling out and they’re setting up volleys. And it looks like they almost have all of the stuff here in order to repel this attack,
Rhi: Yikes. Yeah, so we need to get the heck out.
John: What’s the plan?
Rhi: Oh man.
John: Do you wanna dive over the wall and hope?
Minna: There’s a river down there.
Rhi: I mean, and I do still have my climbing gear.
Minna: Yeah.
John: It’s true.
Minna: We’ve established it’s not enough rope to necessarily bridge the gap, but we can get down further and then try and jump into the river.
John: Yeah.
Rhi: Hmm. I’m wondering… okay. How do flash— do flashbacks work basically the same as in Blades?
John: Yeah, totally.
Rhi: What would it cost for a flashback with some other squad? We arranged, like, okay, we’re gonna come—
John: Like an exit point?
Rhi: Yeah. An exit point where they would be there with, like… I dunno, more rope. Or a net or something, where they can help us get down.
John: Sure. Yeah, I mean, are you looking to eliminate the fact that you have to roll, or just reduce the…
Rhi: Reduce the consequences.
John: I think that’s a one stress flashback. Like, you’re basically saying maybe they could have thrown up some grappling hooks and then hightailed it out before they got caught.
Rhi: Yeah, okay. So yeah, I’ll take that one stress. I have one stress box left.
John: Good luck! [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] You know what, I had my moment of glory, I’m good.
John: [laughs] Awesome. So yeah, the squad all assembles. You are out on the parapet. There’s a bunch of grappling hooks that are dug into the wall and it looks like you have a shot down to the river. You just have to get down there.
Rhi: Yeah, so group Maneuver, I guess?
Minna: Uh huh.
John: I think this does feel like it could be risky, because you are carrying somebody and, like, that’s a thing. There’s also a bunch of rookies and you’re trying to get out quick.
Rhi: Yeah. Who’s leading?
Minna: I can lead.
Rhi: Oh yeah, cause you’ll only take one. Alright, 4. What did, um…
Minna: I have not rolled yet.
Rhi: Yeah. Alright.
Minna: Let’s just go for it.
Kim: Hey!
John: There you go.
Rhi: A 6, heck yeah.
John: That is fantastic. Okay, yeah, it was a grim there for a second, but yeah. [laughs] I think there’s probably a moment when Emerald Rushing is like, not properly clipped in and loses their footing, and maybe you manage to grab them and keep them from falling.
Rhi: I think that I’m the last one down because I stay up on the wall with my flare gun and I fire two flares up, and that’s the signal to Zora that, like, we’re out! Go!
John: Peace, deuces! [laughs]
Rhi: But that’s also like, you know, I think I fire that, I jump over the wall and there’s, like, a volley of arrows where I was standing.
Minna: Yeah.
John: Fantastic. Awesome. Okay, and I think that’s the end of the mission. Like, I don’t see anything else. You guys get down to the river, manage to swim across, get out of dodge. Manage to recover the Commander and get away.
Rhi: Yay, and we didn’t lose any of our redshirts.
Kim: We did it!
Rhi: I’m so proud.
Minna: Yes.
John: [laughs] So, there is a little bit of book-keeping that we do between here and the downtime scenes. And then we do some downtime scenes, and then we’re done with the session.
Rhi: Cool.
John: So, the next bit, because this is the first session, the next bit would be to go ahead and make the command staff, the roles, as their called. They are under the characters the Commander, the Marshal and the Quartermaster. Each of you would play one of these. We don’t need to go through too much of actually doing the setup, because we’re not going to push forward past this point. Cool, so now you’re at the Western Front. And then you can have back at camp scenes. Potentially I can set a back at camp scene, but you had in mind something that you wanted to see, and I kinda wanna just go do that. So, what was the scene that you wanted to do?
Minna: Yeah, can I ask, what’s the back at camp scene supposed to be?
John: Oh, so there’s a list of back at camp scenes that you can chose from. Essentially, the list is based on your morale. So ,what you do is you look at your morale and you decide, okay, well we’re good morale because we’re at 9, and we’re gonna chose one of the scenes that looks fun.
Minna: I feel like the squad talking about home and asking the captain about theirs could be an interesting one with the Commander.
John: Oh, yeah. That’s cool.
Minna: So we find out how much he lost.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: So, who do you wanna play in that scene? Because one of you is, I am assuming someone should play the Commander.
Rhi: Yeah. Since I think I laid dibs on the Commander role, I can play them. Zaya is off drinking and telling stories of her incredible shot.
John: [laughs] Bragging.
Rhi: Is she mildly mocking the snipers? Maybe.
Minna: [laughs]
Rhi: Is there gonna be a drunken shoot-off later? Who’s to say?
Minna: Does one them tell her to watch her back when they’re in their sniping position next time? A little bit.
Rhi: Mm hmm.
John: Awesome.
Rhi: Oh I gotta think of a, I gotta come up with a name for the Commander real quick. Let me look at the list of names. I think it’s Commander Khatri.
John: Oh, nice.
Minna: Beautiful.
Rhi: Commander is not addressed by their first name.
John: Very cool.
Minna: And they’re from the same heritage as me. They’re also Bartan.
Rhi: Yeah, I picked Bartan for their heritage, reputation is unstoppable, personality I went with stoic and calculating, their look is athletic and currently very haggard.
John: Nice.
Minna: Aw, buddy.
Rhi: They’re not having the best time. It’s been a bad day.
John: It’s been a bad few weeks, actually.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Oh…
Rhi: Yeah. So, where do we think this scene takes place?
Minna: I feel like it’s in the Commander’s tent.
John: Have you invited them to, like, say thank you?
Rhi: Hmm. I think so, I think we’ve kind of established this Commander is kind of like, stern and stoic but will give praise and acknowledgement when it’s been earned.
John: Sure.
Rhi: Yeah. So, I think that when the two of you get there, that like there is a medic who’s, like, fussing over them. And the medic will head out when the two of you come in.
Rhi (as Khatri): Captain Dewa, Arani. Where’s Alikovna?
Minna (as Mitali): As far as I know, she’s off getting drunk and mocking the snipers.
Rhi (as Khatri): Ah. I suppose she’s earned that.
Minna (as Mitali): [laughs] I would say she has.
Rhi (as Khatri): Both— all of you, the rest of the squad as well, have very much earned my thanks. Don’t know how much longer I would have been able to hold out against that thing.
Minna (as Mitali): I don’t know how long we would hold out without you to command us.
Rhi (as Khatri): Well, you may need to have that conversation. There’s not a lot of us left, and if the army falls apart on one person, not much of an army.
Minna (as Mitali): But we didn’t fall apart. We found you, we came for you, we devised a plan. We can function without you; we just don’t want to.
Rhi (as Khatri): Hmm. Well, I appreciate that.
Rhi: I’m imagining that they’re, like, in bed but propped up. Just kinda like, leans their head back.
John: I am squee-ing so hard because this is, like, really cool.
Rhi: [laughs]
John: I wanna know, do either Mitali or the Commander say anything about the memories?
Minna: I feel like this is how this comes up.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna (as Mitali): Commander, I feel that I have to lay this on the table. I saw a few things that I don’t think you would have liked me to see.
Rhi (as Khatri): Hmph. Well, I think that went both ways.
Minna (as Mitali): Oh. I wasn’t aware.
Rhi (as Khatri): Yes.
Minna (as Mitali): Can I ask, nothing too embarrassing? There are things one doesn’t want one’s Commander to see. One wants to earn their respect.
Rhi (as Khatri): [laughs]
Rhi: Gosh, I’m trying to think. What memories do you think the Commander got of yours?
Minna: Oh boy…
John: Does it matter? You should say no. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: Yeah, that’s fair.
Rhi: That’s true.
John: But I love the idea that you might be lying. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, I think that there’s a moment of hesitation. Just, maybe Miltali picks up on it, maybe she doesn’t, but the Commander’s like:
Rhi (as Khatri): No. Nothing too terrible, and all secrets are safe with me. Don’t worry about it.
Minna (as Mitali): That’s good to hear.
Rhi (as Khatri): How are you holding up, Arun?
Kim (as Arun): Honestly, I’m fine.
[laughter]
Rhi (as Khatri): You and the squad did some work through those Gaunts. You got the makings of an officer yourself. May put you in charge of a squad next time we send you out.
Kim (as Arun): I might want to reconsider until I get a bit more field experience, with all due respect, sir, but I appreciate the compliment.
Rhi (as Khatri): [sighs] Well…
Rhi: I there anything else we wanted to cover in this? Because I feel like the Commander’s like, thank you, please leave so I can sleep, oh God my head. [laughs]
Kim: Yeah.
Minna: Aw.
Kim: Well, his head got poked.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, I imagine this has gotta be the worst migraine imaginable.
John: Oh my God, yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: So, I think the Commander nods to each of you and is like:
Rhi (as Khatri): Thank you again, and I’ll send for Zaya in the morning. Bright and early.
[laughter]
Minna (as Mitali): Good to see you didn’t lose your sense of humor, sir.
Rhi (as Khatri): Managed not to take that.
Rhi: And I think kinda gives you the nod of, “dismissed”.
Minna: She salutes.
John: That’s fantastic. So yeah that’s basically the game. There’d be some downtime actions that happen. Downtime actions happen for the Legion as a whole, so you don’t get individual downtime actions. The Legion as a whole, particularly the Quartermaster, is the one who decides which downtime actions to pursue.
Kim: Oh.
John: Yeah. So those are the things, essentially, each of these things is slightly a different responsibility. So you would decide, do we recover? Do we, like, provide rest and recuperation for people, if they’re injured? Or do we give them liberties to blow off some steam? Do we start some long-term projects? What do we do as a Legion? And then, the Commander decides what kinds of missions that they want to pursue inside the theatre that they are operating in. So, you would say, Western Front has both Assault and Recon missions available. You would say, “I really would prefer to get Assaults” or “I would prefer to get Recons,” and then I would roll some missions, generate those, and then you’re gonna get a set of missions which is probably, like, two to three. Yeah, in that case, if you roll three you can only do two missions. Because you just don’t have the staff. The third mission you fail automatically, and that’s a bummer, but it’s also just the reality of the situation you’re in.
Rhi: Yeah.
John: And that’s basically— oh, and then the Marshal decides once you have the set of missions and the Commander has selected which mission will be primary mission, that’s the one you play through, and secondary mission, that’s the one you resolve with a fortune roll, the Marshal decides who goes on those missions. So, they staff those missions with specialists and the appropriate squad. So, any given session, you may or may not be playing the specialist that you generated at the beginning, and you may be playing a specialist that was played by someone else before.
Rhi: Oh, interesting.
John: Yeah.
Rhi: That’s cool. Alright, well that was really fun. Thank you so much for running this for us.
Kim: Yeah, thank you.
John: Yeah. I’m glad you enjoyed it.
Rhi: And yeah, yeah. I’m a little bummed that this isn’t gonna be more into a campaign, because yeah, all of that you described about how the downtime works and the campaign maneuvers, that’s a very cool element to this. This was a very fun one-shot, thank you so much for running this for us.
Minna: Yeah.
Kim: Yeah.
John: Absolutely guys. Thanks for having me.

##Intro
Rhi: Welcome back to Duskwall. Today, we’re going back in time, both in the history of Duskwall, and in terms of recording. This was actually one of the very first bonus episodes I ever recorded for The Magpies, back in May 2018. I’ve been waiting for the right time to release it ever since. This episode stars my good friend Paulomi, who is also the showrunner for the Iron Hides Podcast. It’s a weird west Monster of the Week Actual Play, and stars several past and present Magpies. There’s a link to the show in the notes and I highly recommend you check it out.
In this episode, we’re not playing Blades in the Dark. Instead, we’re playing a really cool two-player RPG called A Scoundrel in the Deep. In this game, one person plays the Scoundrel: an adventurer, treasure-hunter or thief who has ventured into the depths to claim a valuable prize. The other person plays the Deep: the threats and challenges that the scoundrel must overcome to escape with their treasure and their life. And the game isn’t played with dice, cards or even a Jenga tower. It’s played with burning matches.
I’d like to take this moment to give a special thanks to James and Mel D’Amato, who let us play with matches around their very nice recording equipment in their apartment. Thanks for letting us use your equipment, and for trusting us not to set your table on fire. For this story, I reskinned the game to line up with the setting of Duskwall. If you’d like to hear a playthrough of the original version of the game, check out the excellent One Shot episode of A Scoundrel in the Deep, starring James D’Amato and Jeff Stormer. I’ll link to that episode and to the game itself in the notes.
Other announcements: our Patreon backer drive and giveaway contest is still ongoing. When we hit 100 backers on Patreon, five of those backers will win 3D-printed Magpies pins. We’ve picked up a few new backers recently, which is fantastic. Plus, we’re now less than $50 away from our $400 per month goal. If we hit that goal, we’ll be able to buy better recording equipment for the whole cast, and then work on setting up a merch store with t-shirts and other Magpies gear. So, if you’re able, check out our Patreon and back us.
It’s still international podcast Month and there are tons of great episodes to listen to. I hosted an episode on accessibility in tabletop RPGs, and I played in a really delightful game of Good Society. The Scum and Villainy episode run by friend and guest star Waffles is another great one to check out. I will also be at AcadeCon in November, ready to play games and give away Magpies bookmarks. I am looking forward to seeing folks there. Next, Josie is going to tell us about this month’s featured charity.
Josie: On August 31st, many peaceful counter-protesters standing against the white supremacist “straight pride parade”, big air quotes on that one, in Boston were assaulted by police unprovoked and wrongfully improved. The Solidarity Against Hate Legal Defense Fund is an ongoing fundraiser to post bail for these brave individuals. Fortunately, the goal for bail was met within a few hours, but you can still help. All further proceeds will be split between donations to the Mass Bail Fund, a national organization that works to free people from incarceration and end money bail, and Boston GLASS, which provides all manner of vital services to queer trans people of color. Please donate to the fundraiser and/or directly to those groups. Thank you.
Rhi: The specific fundraiser that Josie mentions has ended now, but you can still donate to the Mass Bail Fund and Boston GLASS at the links in the notes.
Now then. Let’s get started, shall we?
##Story begins [00.04.07]
Rhi: Welcome to a very special bonus episode of The Magpies. I am joined by my good friend Paulomi.
Paulomi: Hi everyone.
Rhi: And we are going to be playing a game called A Scoundrel in the Deep. But before I get too much into describing the game, Paulomi, do you want to tell the listeners a little bit about yourself, plug anything you wanna plug?
Paulomi: Yeah! So, I mostly scream about Padme and other Star Wars things on twitter.com @PaulomiSP but I’m also currently recording, hopefully releasing at some point, a weird western podcast called Iron Hides. So, you should tune into that on the pod networks.
Rhi: Yes, and it will probably be out by the time this episode airs, so I will definitely put a link to that in the show notes.
Paulomi: Yes, fingers crossed.
Rhi: Yes. [laughs] So, A Scoundrel in the Deep is a very interesting roleplay game. It is also one that would be basically impossible to play online, so I had to wait until Paulomi came to Chicago to visit so that I would have a reason to play it. Because the central mechanic of A Scoundrel in the Deep is not dice, or cards or anything like that. It is burning matches that we will be passing back and forth. So, the game is about a scoundrel who has set out to claim some kind of treasure. And they have succeeded in claiming this treasure. However now that have to survive the journey back. And this game is the story of that journey. And in this game, I have sort of applied a Blades in the Dark flavor to A Scoundrel in the Deep, so I have been referring to it as A Scoundrel in the Dark. In this, I will be playing the part of the Dark. I will be all of the terrors of the Deathlands that are trying to keep Paulomi’s Scoundrel from making it back to Duskwall successfully and alive and with the treasure. So, I think on that note…
Paulomi: Yes.
Rhi: We will get into the game proper. It is the year 797 of The Imperium. Nearly 8 centuries has passed since the cataclysm. And through it all, Duskwall has lived on. You are a scoundrel of Duskwall. What kind of scoundrel are you?
Paulomi: I feel like I am a thief. Just a regular old thief who goes around stealing things and somehow ended up in this tomb-raiding situation.
Rhi: So, yes. You have left Duskwall and ventured into the Deathlands, seeking a legendary relic. What drove you out here?
Paulomi: Desperation, I feel like. I, for whatever reason, was at the end of my rope in Duskwall, so I decided that the best way to seek my fortune was leaving it and finding something that can allow me to do that.
Rhi: Well, you found it. You hold in your hands a simple wooden box that contains the Heart of Kotar. It is said to be the mummified heart of an ancient hero, or sorcerer, or demon. Someone powerful whose heart contains much of that power. Now, you just have to make it back to the city. Your supplies dwindle, the electroplasm that fuels your lantern has long since run out. Luckily, you still have…
Paulomi: A spiritbane charm for all the ghosties and my length of sturdy rope, which I have had since the beginning of this journey.
Rhi: Alright. So, you have emerged from the small, unassuming tomb where the Heart was hidden. The tomb itself is one of several in the little valley, tucked away amongst some kills far from Duskwall. And as you emerge, you can see the faint broken shards of the sun fading from view. It’s just past dawn and the Deathlands are plunged into infinite, unceasing darkness.
Paulomi: My lamp has died. Tired and hungry, I must scramble in the pitch dark. Only a few matches separate me from endless inky blackness. My fate is in my own hands.
Rhi: But peril lurks in the dark.
Paulomi: I just need to make it back to Duskwall.
Rhi: So, I have described the first location. You light the match, hand it to me, and I will tell you the first peril that you are encountering. I should also, before you light that, one other thing. If we, either one of us, does two pulls with the match and it doesn’t light, then if I do that, if it fails to light after I strike twice, then the peril does not manifest. It was just a weird noise, it was just the wind, it was a cat.
Paulomi: [laughs]
Rhi: And you are able to walk on unscathed and, I believe, claim an item. That basically counts as a win for you.
Paulomi: Cool.
Rhi: If you strike twice and it doesn’t light, then the peril catches you completely off guard and will just take you out. Not kill you, but, you know, you suffer from it.
Paulomi: Okay, gotcha.
Rhi: So.
Paulomi: Okay! [laughs]
Rhi: No pressure.
Paulomi: Here we go.
[match strike]
Rhi: Alright.
Paulomi: Yay!
Rhi: You make your way across the courtyard and you hear footsteps, first on one side, then the other. Then in front of you. And you see a feline shape. An umbra-lion, phasing in and out of the ghost field as it stalks you.
Paulomi: Um… I… what just happened?
Rhi: It burned out, and so—
Paulomi: No!
Rhi: This one is mine. I’m gonna dunk it in here, just so that I don’t, like, light anything on fire.
Paulomi: [laughs]
Rhi: Alright. So yeah, it burned out while you were holding it, before you could describe how you defeated it.
Paulomi: Rude!
Rhi: [laughs] So, you see the feline shape of the umbra-lion in front of you, and before you can react, before you can run, it disappears and then reappears already pouncing. It tackles you to the ground, it tears at your skin and at your clothing. You manage to throw it off and run, but you, rather than, you know, taking the path that you knew led you to this place, you just run off into the dark.
Paulomi: Crap. [laughs]
Rhi: So.
Paulomi: Well, crap sandwich.
Rhi: But the umbra-lion does not follow you. Perhaps there’s easier prey closer by? But that’s of little comfort as you are now somewhere out in the dark.
Paulomi: Okay.
Rhi: So, the matchbook comes to me, and I will describe the location you find yourself in. You run across the fields and low hills for a time, hoping to lose the umbra-lion, and eventually your footsteps begin to splash as you find yourself in the remains of a swamp. There’s not really a lot of plant life here. A fair amount of fungus and mushrooms growing. You remember skirting around the edge of this place when you came out to the tomb, because in the darkness you can’t see where there sinkholes and deep pools of water that you could just fall into and sink forever. But now, you are sort of faced with having to make your way through it. Now I’ll light the match, describe the peril, and pass it to you. As you begin to make your way across the swamp, you hear overhead the flapping of wings. Great, vast wings. Deathlands crows that seek your spirit to feed their hunger.
Paulomi: So, I think what I do is I take my spiritbane charm and basically chuck it at one of those crows.
Rhi: Okay, yeah.
Paulomi: [yelps]
Rhi: Okay, yep, that counts for you. That was very close.
Paulomi: My fingees! [laughs]
Rhi: Yep. Okay, so you now have lost the spiritbane charm. You do not have that. So, the charm flies through the air and the crows shriek and dive out of the way and go wheeling back off into the darkness. They don’t wanna challenge you. So, it’s back to you and now you get to describe after you make your way through the swamp, the next place you that find yourself in out in the Deathlands.
Paulomi: Okay. So, I think I’m basically following my best instinct when it comes to orienting myself. I’m kinda just going in the direction that I feel like I need to be going in. And eventually I feel like the swamp gives way to more of, like, a grassy sort of situation, with maybe a river running through it.
Rhi: Okay.
Paulomi: Or a small creek. And I’m walking alongside this river because knowing Duskwall, rivers have to lead to it somehow.
Rhi: Yes.
Paulomi: So, I’m just walking along that, I think. And so, I light a match now?
Rhi: Yes. Well, I’m gonna set up the peril.
Paulomi: Gotcha.
Rhi: Because peril lurks in the dark. As you are making your way along the side of this creek, you hear a sort of clattering and clanking. Looking around in the darkness, you can’t see it, but it’s getting louder and it’s getting closer. So, now you light.
Paulomi: Okay.
[match strike]
Rhi: Ooh.
Paulomi: Shit. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] So, you’re looking around and the darkness is impenetrable. The noise seems to be echoing, you can’t pinpoint a direction. Then, something slams into your back and you scramble away, twisting around to see a rusted metal frame, vaguely humanoid, with a blue, cold light burning in its eyes.
This is a Hull. A clockwork creation given a sort of unnatural life by the trapped spirit essence that fuels it. Normally they are servile. They are designed to carry out orders, to transport, to protect, to serve. This one, though, is attacking, and you’re not sure if it is a rage or hunger, but it continues to approach you, these metal arms swinging at you. And you scramble across the creek, the cold water just soaking through your boots and your clothes, and you scramble to the other side hoping to lose it. It is slowed down by the water, and you find yourself on the other side of this creek in the remains of what seems like a village of some kind. You know enough history to know that that’s something that used to happen. People would have small settlements outside the big cities. But it’s not something that’s even remotely possible now. But this looks like it was once one of those places. Some 800 years old. There’s not much left, just sort of low stone foundations outlining where houses and other buildings once stood.
But peril lurks in the dark. You realize as you’re making your way through this village that you aren’t alone. You hear footsteps, but not the footsteps of the umbra-lion that you heard before, or even those of the Hull. These sound like humans. And you hear low voices from somewhere up ahead.
[match strike]
Rhi: Oop.
[match strike]
Rhi: Um, so, for our listeners. Paulomi and I both on our last two match strikes have—
Paulomi: Whiffed it!
Rhi: Have failed to actually light a match, because I think, at least for me, I probably light a match maybe six times a year.
Paulomi: [laughs]
Rhi: It’s not a skill I have a lot of practice with. So, yeah. How do you evade this peril?
Paulomi: So, I think some of the structures in this derelict village are still standing and I feel like when I hear voices close to me, I duck into one of the small, sort of thatched huts and kind of hide there, crouched in a corner. Very much fetal position, knees to my chest, kind of with a box sandwiched between me. And just wait until those voices either fade away or they lose interest in me.
Rhi: Yeah. It seems like they hadn’t noticed you, weren’t necessarily interested in you specifically. You hear them talking about recovering supplies, bringing them back to camp, but they move past your hiding spot without giving you any trouble. So, this also means you are able to, because you defeated this peril without using an item, you are able to recover an item here. So, what is something that you find in this ruined village that will be of help to you?
Paulomi: So, I feel like this crew of people have been here, and maybe they were doing some researching or whatever, but they have forgotten about a small piece of equipment in this place that I’m hiding in. And when I kind of check around me, once I don’t hear the voices anymore, I think it is a flintlock pistol that someone dropped for whatever reason. And I kind of just take that, tuck it into my belt.
Rhi: Alright.
Paulomi: And move on with my day. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. So, you have picked up a pistol.
Paulomi: Yes.
Rhi: And moving on from the village, what is the next location you find yourself in?
Paulomi: I think woods and stuff are still totally a thing out here? Or…
Rhi: Trees don’t grow anymore, but you can still find dead trees standing.
Paulomi: Okay, cool. So, I think I find myself kind of walking into what used to be a forest. It’s probably more mushroom than tree at this point.
Rhi: Yeah.
Paulomi: And it’s kind of tough terrain because there are, like, roots everywhere. It’s gnarled and it’s dark so I can’t really pick my way through.
Rhi: Peril lurks in the dark.
Paulomi: Oh shit.
Rhi: As you’re picking your way through this dark, dead forest, you see movement and light somewhere far up ahead. Just flickers of… not fire light, not even the glow of an electroplasmic lantern. This is a different sort of light, and as you get closer, you recognize it as the light that a ghost emanates as it manifests outside the ghost field. So, now you light it. We hope.
[match strike]
Rhi: There you go. The spirit approaches you, and you recognize with a start that you know this face. This is someone that you betrayed back in Duskwall.
Paulomi: I think I… gosh. Crap! Um, I think I’ve frozen in place for a little while, and then I bolt, basically, running towards the ghost and running past it.
Rhi: Okay. So, the spirit shrieks at you as you sprint past. The tree branches lash at you, but you don’t stop, you just keep going and going, and eventually you burst out of the tree line on the other side. This vengeful spirit somehow finding you all the way out here, remains within the boundary of the forest. And what item do you find as you are making your escape?
Paulomi: You mentioned that if there are people, they’re not going to make it. [laughs] But, I really like the idea of basically colliding, just headlong, into another person. Probably a straggler from that research camp that I was nearby earlier. And I think we both, like, go rolling for a second. And I jump up very quickly and kind of draw the pistol that I have tucked away in my belt. And I’m just like:
Paulomi (as Scoundrel): Who are you?
Rhi: Who are they? Who is this person? What do they look like?
Paulomi: I think they are, like, they’re a very petite lady. She’s got glasses on and her hair is, like, tied back very tightly. And she’s… [laughs] I love the idea of her having those horrible jodhpurs on as well.
Rhi: [laughs]
Paulomi: [laughs] But, she kinda dusts herself off, holds her hands up and introduces herself. Her name is Ora, and she is a mercenary, I think. Immediately I’m just like:
Paulomi (as Scoundrel): You don’t look like a mercenary.
Rhi (as Ora): You don’t look like the kind of person who should be out here at all. What are you doing here?
Paulomi: And then I try not glance at the box that I have kind of tucked under my elbow.
Paulomi (as Scoundrel): I don’t think that’s any of your business.
Rhi (as Ora): [sighs] I assume you’re trying to get back to the city?
Paulomi (as Scoundrel): Uh, yes, I am.
Rhi (as Ora): I got separated from the rest of my group and heading back there seems safer than wandering around out here, so shall we try to make the trek together?
Paulomi: I think I, like, eye her suspiciously, but I’m still tucking my pistol away while I do that.
Paulomi (as Scoundrel): Yeah. I think that’s fine.
Rhi (as Ora): Alright.
Rhi: And the two of you set off in this sort of uneasy, wary partnership. So, where do the two of you end up next?
Paulomi: So, I think we kind of make our way through these weird mushroom deadwoods and we reach a point where, sort of, the hills start up again. And it’s gonna be much more of a hike, I think, this next section. They are slightly more clustered together, they’re more like little hillocks, just sort of here and there, and we’ll occasionally cross a completely derelict or broken-down fence. I feel like maybe at some point, this used to be farmland. It is not anymore. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. But peril lurks in the dark.
[match strike]
Rhi: Oops.
[match strike]
Rhi: Alright. So, the two of you make your way across an empty field, and you see a surging spirit well that is just ghosts pouring out of it and start coming towards you.
Paulomi: I think I… oh gosh… argh!
Rhi: Okay, yep, that one goes to me.
Paulomi: Yep.
Rhi: So, the spirits swarm you and surround you both. You hear Ora shouting, you hear the shrieking of the spirits. You can feel them trying to force their way into your mind to try to possess you, to take control. And you manage to resist and fight them off, but it is taxing and you are exhausted. You feel just mentally and emotionally and even physically just drained by the time you make it across this farmland and out. Ora is still with you, seemingly having had a bit of an easier time. She doesn’t look quite as drained as you do. But she seems to be stumbling a little bit as she catches up, and just sort of looks to you and says:
Rhi (as Ora): Alright, where… I don’t even know where we are. Where do we go next?
Paulomi: Yeah. I think I ask her if she’s okay and kinda like, put a hand on her shoulder to steady her. And then… I’m describing our surroundings now?
Rhi: No, I will.
Paulomi: Okay.
Rhi: Yeah, when you touch her, she startles a little bit, but then nods in answer to your question, and you continue on. And also, just as reference, so I have three out of the five matches that I need for the darkness to be triumphant here. And how many matches do you have?
Paulomi: I have three also. [laughs]
Rhi: Three out of ten. So, this is looking a little rough for our scoundrel here. So, the two of you continue on across the expanse of farmland outside of Duskwall. There’s basically nothing to see. There’s, you know, darkness and flatness, and you just keep walking until you come up to the top of sort of a rise in a small hill and you both almost plough into a half-crumbled wall. As you circle around it, you find— it looks like some kind of temple. It’s a small structure, but there’s some pillars, there is a, towards the back center of the space, there’s a pedestal with some sort of statue on it. The statue has been not just worn down by time, but it looks like deliberately destroyed and desecrated. There are runes engraved on it, there are pieces scattered across the floor to the point where you can’t even really tell what it used to be. And peril lurks in the dark of this temple.
[match strike]
Rhi: You hear a voice whispering to you from behind the statue.
Rhi (as Voice): Free me, and I’ll grant you anything you want.
Paulomi: Um… I think instead of listening to what that voice is saying, I am having none of this and smashing the statue to the ground.
Rhi: Okay. So, there is very little left of this statue, but you still sort of jump up on the pedestal and shove the remaining pieces to the ground. And as each piece shatters, you hear a distant echoing shriek.
Rhi (as Voice): No! No! Anything, I’ll do anything!
Rhi: But each piece keeps shattering. Ora just sort of has stood back and sort of watched you, this all happened so quickly she wasn’t even able to react. What useful item do you find in the remains of this temple that will aid you on your journey?
Paulomi: I think kind of adjacent to where the statue was resting there’s probably just like an arrangement of smaller pedestals. And I think on one of those pedestals is a small vial of some kind of oil. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Paulomi: If I were to hold it up to any sort of light, I think it would be very murky and yellow feeling. Feeling more like, I guess, lard than it would be oil. But it’s still very liquid inside, so I think I grab that after seeing it and I take a sniff at it. And I feel like it smells, like, lightly spiced, even. And I think I just tuck that away into a jacket pocket.
Rhi: This could be useful. [laughs]
Paulomi: Could be useful. [laughs]
Rhi: Alright. So, you conquered that peril, which means you get to describe the next location that you find yourselves in.
Paulomi: I think that we definitely rest here for a short amount of time, be it just like taking a quick catnap with my eyes closed and then head resting against a wall.
Rhi: Yeah.
Paulomi: But then we get moving again and we leave here and continue walking towards what I can only hope is the direction of Duskwall. And I think the next sort of area is… gosh. I’m like, thinking about English countryside still. Oh! We’re kind of reaching this patch of grouped ruins, where equally ruined fences are not really holding back people from kind of tramping over these really overgrown and then wilted beds of some kind. Like, flowerbeds. And I think we’re just kind of moving through here. There’s a lot of pieces of structures still standing, I think. Some brick and mortar and wood frames and such. But everything is mostly just a pile of rubble.
Rhi: But peril lurks in the dark. As the two of you are making your way through this, sort of, again, another ruined village, you hear footsteps running towards you, and this time you are not gonna get caught off guard. You spin around, that pistol raised, but before you can get a shot off, you see a man running towards you…
[match strike]
[groans]
[match strike]
Rhi: Okay. So, the man runs towards you and he stops and stumbles and a spirit lunges forward from him, surging towards you, shrieking:
Rhi (as Spirit): Something fresh!
Paulomi: And I feel like the way this works is it’s lunging towards me and I hit the deck and I think Ora is right behind me.
Rhi: Are you— so, are you using Ora?
Paulomi: I am using Ora. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay. So, you dive to the ground. Ora doesn’t scream, or cry out, she just:
Rhi (as Ora): [short gasp]
Rhi: And then, there’s silence. How do you react at this point?
Paulomi: I feel like there’s a moment where everything is just sort of frozen, and I’ve been her before, and I think I run at Ora and shove her to the ground, and run past her and basically just run for my life. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah, Ora does not resist or move. She just sort of falls over when you push her. But as you get close to push her, you see her eyes that have gone just sort of flat and glassy. And there’s a faint blue glow in her pupils. She falls and you run on, and because you used an item to defeat that you do not get another item. But you do get to describe the next location. So, where do you run to after allowing a ghost to possess this person who was helping you escape?
Paulomi: [whines]
Rhi: [laughs]
Paulomi: Um, let’s see. I think I run for a while, as long as basically my body will allow me to before I have to, like, collapse and catch my breath. And I think at this point the first thing I’m going to do is check that I still have the box, and I think I kind of like crack the lid a little bit and see that everything in there is still alright.
Rhi: Yep. It doesn’t look like much. It looks like a kind of dried out husk of, like, leather, or meat. You haven’t touched it yet. You’re kind of afraid to, because you don’t know how it works or what’ll happen. But, it matches all the descriptions that you found of what this heart should be. So, you’re pretty sure that you’ve got the right thing. You hope.
Paulomi: I think I, like, snap it closed when I get a whiff of it, and then I tuck it back under my arm and stand up, still kind of trying to catch my breath, but still a lot better than I was. And I’m looking around me and I’m basically in just another stretch of, like, flat, grassy terrain I think. There’s not really any structures of anything to mention in sight. And I find that, like, underfoot there might be an overgrown trail. Like, wagon ruts, basically, on either side of my feet. And I think I’m just gonna follow that, moving forward.
Rhi: Alright. But peril lurks in the dark. You follow this path for a while and you think that you see, maybe on the horizon, there’s a flicker of light that maybe that’s the lightning barrier, maybe that’s Duskwall. And then you see, sort of silhouetted against that light, what looks like a lone tree, standing by the side of this path. And you’re about to just pass it by without a thought, and then the tree moves.
Paulomi: [whines]
[match strike]
Rhi: It lunges for you, now taking a more humanoid form. Thick, wooden arms swinging to strike at you, to knock you to the ground.
Paulomi: I think I basically whip out my pistol and shoot it straight in what I assume to be its face.
Rhi: Okay. How many do you have?
Paulomi: Six.
Rhi: Six, okay. You are catching up.
Paulomi: Uh huh.
Rhi: So, you shoot this thing and splinters fly everywhere. Ii recoils back. It doesn’t make a sound, but its arms are flailing and you, in its confusion, are able to continue running off down the path and escape. I think you’ve gotten 3 in a row.
Paulomi: I have.
Rhi: So, you let fate slip through your fingers. You’re pretty sure now, you follow this path for a while, for what must be hours. It’s impossible to tell, because there is no sun, there are no stars during day, you just are walking and walking, and you are, by this point, exhausted and hungry and you are just focusing on the spot of light on the horizon, that you’re now certain has to be Duskwall. And as you’re walking, you pass by a watchtower. Its old and crumbling, but there’s still enough of a structure there that it could provide some shelter. But peril lurks in the dark.
[match strike]
Rhi: And as you enter the watchtower, you hear the clanking of chains along the walls, and then the chains lash out towards you, trying to wrap around you and grab you and drag you into something.
Paulomi: I basically just, like, as I was walking into the clocktower, the chains were reaching for me and I basically run backwards out of the clocktower.
Rhi: Okay. [laughs]
Paulomi: [laughs]
Rhi: Alright. So you, once again, run.
Paulomi: Lots of running. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Well, I mean, it’s… you know. But now you’ve, you know, that was a place where maybe you could have gotten some rest, waited until the relatively lighter night, when the moons are out are there are at least stars to navigate by. But now you just have to keep pressing on. You do find either inside the tower before the chains attack, or outside of it, you find an item that can help you.
Paulomi: So, as I’m sort of backing up out of this tower, just doing a whole lot of nope out of this clock tower, I think I stumble backwards because I’ve tripped on something and I kinda looked underfoot and I pick up this lump of really tattered looking fabric. It’s very woolen. And when I kind of lift it up, bones sort of just tumble out of it.
Rhi: Jeez.
Paulomi: And I’m just kind of like, ugh, and shake it off to get any extra bone residue off of it.
Rhi: There’s a little bit of, like, dust that flies out that you don’t wanna think too much about the contents of.
Paulomi: Absolutely not. But I think there are starting to— it’s dark even though it’s daytime, so I feel like there’s a very pervasive sort of misty bone chill that’s going on, and I think I do end up turning this cloak inside out and then wrapping it around myself, just to keep myself warm. Because even that small bit of comfort makes it easier, I think, to forget how hungry and thirsty I am. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Alright, so you press on and where do you find yourself next?
Paulomi: I feel like I’m still following that sort of wagon path that’s all overgrown. And near this clock tower, I feel like there might be another, sort of, ruined town or hamlet. So, that wagon trail probably turns into, like, a really pockmarked cobblestone. And I think these houses, like, I think what got this particular town wasn’t time so much as, just, a terrible fire.
Rhi: Okay.
Paulomi: So, everything looks very gnarled and ashen and it definitely still has, like, that smell of smoke sort of clinging to it.
Rhi: But peril lurks in the dark. And you make your way through this burned, ruined town, and the smell of smoke gets stronger and stronger as you keep walking. And if you light the match…
[match strike]
Rhi: The smoke gets stronger, and it coalesces into a humanoid form that lunges towards you, claws out, lashing at you.
Paulomi: And I think, um, basically I— oh! Crap. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs]
Paulomi: I panicked! You take that.
Rhi: Alright.
Paulomi: The match, like, flared up.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah that match went really fast.
Paulomi: Because there was a splinter, I think. So it just like… [woosh sound]
Rhi: Yeah.
Paulomi: [laughs]
Rhi: So, this creature, this demon of smoke, lunges at you, claws out, slams into you. And you already could barely see anything, but now you can’t see at all. The smoke is covering your eyes, filling your lungs. You’re coughing and flailing, trying to get this thing off of you. And it releases you for a moment and lunges away as if it’s going to sort of circle around and pounce on you again. And you scramble off into a building, climbing quickly through the ruins, and manage to break line of sight on it for just a moment or two. But that’s enough for it to lose track of you, and you rush off into the darkness, but you’re no longer on that path. So… I have four and you are at seven?
Paulomi: [cringes]
Rhi: Just to put that out there. You are able to kind of orient yourself. You’re able to find that smear of light on the horizon again and you start walking towards it, just walking and walking. And you feel like you have to be seeing, at some point soon, you know, the faint broken shards of the sun as it sets. But the darkness remains. You don’t really see anything, even as you keep walking. You start to hear whispers. Can’t make out words initially. But even just in this emptiness, you hear faint, whispering voices.
[match strike]
Rhi: And the voices say:
Rhi (as Voices): Give us the power that you hold and we will grant you rest and safety. Just hand it over.
Paulomi: I think I hear those voices. I feel like they are… I can’t tell if they’re something that I’m hearing or actually exist, but I think I walk through them. And I just pull my cloak tighter around myself.
Rhi: Okay.
Paulomi: I’m so tired! [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, you’re so tired. It’s not even just like… just, like, “No.”
Paulomi: Just, so tired.
Rhi: “This is mine. Fuck off.”
Paulomi: I think I’m at… one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You’re correct.
Rhi: You have three items left, so you could…
Paulomi: I do. I could do this.
Rhi: Yeah.
Paulomi: I could pull through on this.
Rhi: You could. What item do you find as you’re just sort of walking trough the rolling hills outside of Duskwall?
Paulomi: Oh gosh. I feel like I am walking trough these hills and there’s sort of this, this just hecked-up wagon off to the side of somewhere. And I kind of like, poke around in that while these voices are just happening around me. And there’s more skeletons, I think. It’s a little bit charred itself, but I think there’s a small bundle in the corner that I kind of pick up and investigate, and in it is just the stalest bread you have ever seen.
Rhi: [laughs]
Paulomi: And the moldiest cheese you have ever seen.
Rhi: Oh no.
Paulomi: But it’s better than having nothing to eat at all. So, I think I eat some of the bread and then tuck the rest away to much on later. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Force yourself to choke down.
Paulomi: Yeah.
Rhi: Okay. And where do you find yourself next as you continue on?
Paulomi: This light on the horizon is sort of growing, I’m definitely imagining like, if you’re in the country and you’re kind of looking toward the city, there’s a faint glow in the sky around it, off the clouds.
Rhi: Yeah, just that aura.
Paulomi: Yeah. So, I feel like I’m kind of just, at this point, fixating on that aura to keep myself going. And I’m more stumbling than I am walking at this point, but I have this cloak pulled around me, I have the box tucked very close to me and I have all this stuff.
Rhi: [laughs]
Paulomi: And the next area that I find myself in, I look around. It’s much more stone and rubble, and I feel like I’m walking through maybe a quarry of some kind. It used to be, at least. There’s huge sort of stones that are— they’re more geometric, definitely chiseled off of the rock surrounding us, but there are stacks of them around still. And I’m kind of, just like, walking through this as my footsteps echo against the rocks.
Rhi: But peril lurks in the dark. So, you hear your footsteps echoing and then the echo sounds kind of strange. It sounds like it’s echoing too much. And you realize there’s a second step of footsteps echoing. And you turn to see a large, probably like eight-foot tall figure, draped in rags. It has sort of a vague suggestion of a face, with glowing blue eyes. So…
[match strike]
Rhi: Whoa!
Paulomi: Ooh.
Rhi: [laughs] You recognize this from stories. This is a harvester. It consumes spirits, and as it moves towards you, you get the sense that it wants to add your spirit to its collection.
Paulomi: And I think I grab for that oil that I found, and even tough I don’t have any rounds left in my pistol, I still sort of turn into a Molotov and throw it at the harvester. [laughs]
Rhi: Okay.
Paulomi: I’m at nine matches.
Rhi: Nice. Okay, so your next one.
Paulomi: Yes.
Rhi: So, you throw this oil at it, and the vial shatters against the harvester’s side and immediately bursts into flame. And the rags that cover this creature also catch aflame. You watch for a moment, assuming that it’s going to start shrieking or falling over, you know, as you would expect something that’s burning to do, but it doesn’t seem to be hurt by the fire. But it is distracted, and it is slowed as pieces of its form are burning and falling off. And you are able to, you know, quickly weave your way trough the rest of the quarry and evade the creature. And, yeah, describe where you find yourself as you face the final peril. As I have four matches, and you have nine. So, however this goes…
Paulomi: Is however it goes!
Rhi: Yes. So, where does the final peril confront you?
Paulomi: So, I think I book it out of the quarry. [laughs] And I feel like I’m running pretty ragged at this point. Like, I’ve had very little to eat and I’ve been walking for a long, long time. And I can feel it, sort of, in my bones of my feet. Just how tired I am. That glow is very much like the glow of hope that I am trying to hold onto on the horizon. And it still feels very far away, even though it’s growing steadily. And I think this next area… the creek that I was following, it kind of veers back into this direction that I’ve been heading, and it’s gotten wider, it’s more a stream, more of a respectable river, I think, than a rivulet.
And there is— I kind of, like, look down because the sound of my footsteps has changed, and I feel like I’m walking on what is essentially a boardwalk. And there are places where, like, the wood has rotted and fallen away, and I have to avoid those. But I’m kind of just looking down at my feet at this point and walking, just trying to put one foot in front of the other before I just collapse of exhaustion.
Rhi: But peril lurks in the dark. And as you are walking, you are so, so tired, and so hungry. Like, this is the most exhausted you have ever been. The most beaten down. And every step, your feet just feel so heavy. And you start to feel from that box that you’ve got tucked under your arm, that you have held onto this whole time, that you have given so much to acquire… you feel a sort of pulsing heartbeat.
Paulomi: [deep breath]
[match strike]
Paulomi: [grimaces]
[match strike]
Paulomi: [sigh of relief]
Rhi: And you hear a voice that says:
Rhi (as Heart of Kotar): Just open it up and use me. You can be anyone. You can leave this broken, ruined body behind, and you can be anyone.
Paulomi: I think that’s the point at which I’m like, this is no longer worth it. [laughs] Okay, so I think I take the rope that I have on me, and I tie it around the box. And, oh fuck…
Rhi: It still counts, you’re using the rope, so.
Paulomi: Okay. So, I, um… my fingees! My poor fingees. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] This is such a dangerous game!
Paulomi: [laughs]
Rhi: It’s very hot! Matches are hot! Fire is very hot! [sings] The more you know…
Paulomi: [laughs] But yeah, like, I don’t know if it’s just my exhaustion-addled brain, or what, but I no longer— like, the thing that I’ve been carrying and kept safe this long is also going to betray me in some capacity. So, I take my rope, I tie a nice tight knot around the box, like, over the lid, and there’s still a sturdy-looking pole that’s holding the dock up, basically. And I tie the other end of the rope around that and just fling the box into the river. Just like, I’m coming back for this later.
Rhi: Okay. So, you’ve thrown this relic into the river somewhere south of Duskwall.
Paulomi: Mm hmm.
Rhi: Tell us of your return. How you get back to the city, and what becomes of you. Why don’t you go back to get it?
Paulomi: I love the idea of just sort of cutting to someone opening up their tavern for the evening and the first customer that comes through the door is this tattered, worn-looking creature that just collapses onto the ground. And it’s me. [laughs] And I am very much just non-responsive when they rush over to try and shake me awake. And I think eventually I have to be carried upstairs and allowed to rest. And I think it takes a couple of months for me to fully recover. And I think for whatever reason, whether its I find a crew to join, or I find, like, a naval crew to join, doesn’t matter. I think I just get diverted. Something else happens and my fortunes change and I don’t need to pawn a possessed heart anymore. [laughs]
Rhi: I like the idea of you join a naval crew.
Paulomi: Yeah.
Rhi: And you just leave Duskwall entirely.
Paulomi: Yup, yup, yup. I like that too.
Paulomi: Yeah. And so, the Heart of Kotar is left out in the Deathlands, so close to Duskwall. At the bottom of a river. Waiting for 50 years. And that is the end of this tale. Congratulations on surviving.
Paulomi: I did it!
Rhi: You did.
Paulomi: Barely! [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] I was very nervous for you when I got up to three matches so early on.
Paulomi: I pulled through! [laughs]
Rhi: You did. You did. So, The Magpies themselves will have to set out to recover this powerful, apparently somewhat sentient relic, and decide what they are going to do with it to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. Hopefully you all enjoyed this bonus episode, and thank you for joining me, Paulomi. This was a lot of fun.
Paulomi: Yeah, I had a lot of fun.

Rhi: So as a side note, I’ll cut this bit, but um, so in the episode I’m going to be editing next actually, The Magpies run into one of these.
Paulomi: Yes!
Rhi: They’re out in the Lost District. And they also set it on fire. So, I have to go with the established canon there that fire doesn’t kill it. [laughs]
Paulomi: Okay. [laughs]
Rhi: But I think it’s gonna distract it enough to slow it down.
Paulomi: I mean, it’s on fire.
Rhi: Yeah. But it’s just, it’s hilarious that every time I present someone with this rag-draped thing full of ghosts, it’s like, “I’m just gonna set it on fire!”

Bonus Episode: Whitehollow Worldbuilding
Transcribed by Tyler (Twitter: @Tyler_MoonSage)
Rhi: Tonight we are going to be building out a little bit the city of Whitehollow which is another city on the continent of Akoros. It is located southwest of Duskwall, still on the coast. It is connected to Duskwall and the greater Empire by rail lines and by sea. Like Duskwall it is surrounded by lightning barriers and protected from spirits by the Spirit Wardens.
Per John Harper… I met with Sean Nittner who works at Evil Hat while I was at GenCon and I mentioned our plans for building out Whitehollow, and he was like oh, let me just text John and see what he has to say about Whitehollow. So, a day after GenCon I got an email from Sean saying that this was sort of John Harper’s two sentence blurb on Whitehollow. It was a small town of artisans that transformed into the primary staging area for the military during the Unity War. Getting your Whitehollow letter meant you were drafted. The Unity War was the war waged by the Empire on Skovlan basically to bring Skovlan under imperial rule. Skovlan was the last holdout of all of the continents, the nations. They were very resistant to joining the Empire, understandably so, because the Empire has treated them like crap.
The Unity War lasted 36 years and it ended only a few years ago. Duskwall is home to a lot of Skovlan refugees who fled the fighting, and Whitehollow previously had a really huge military presence because this is where the ships and soldiers going up to Skovlan were launched out of. That is what we know about Whitehollow. We’re gonna go through some questions and build out this city a little bit more before The Magpies go there for a visit.
So, the first question that I have on my list is a pretty basic one. What is the climate and local environment like? We kind of know what Duskwall is which is kind of constantly cold and foggy. Anybody have thoughts on what it might be like in Whitehollow?
Kim: See, I don’t know how possible this is, because there is no sun in this setting. I have to keep remembering that.
Rhi: Yeah, but I mean, you know, it’s magic. we can hand wave a fair bit.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: What are you thinking?
Kim: I really like the idea of having this be the equivalent of some kind of beach town, have it be a little bit warmer, some places are a bit of tourist traps.
Rhi: Yeah. It is further south…
Kim: Oh, it is?
Rhi: Yeah. It’s southwest of Duskwall. It’s not super, super far south, but it is further south than Duskwall, so I could definitely see where it’s warmer, for sure.
Minna: Yeah, it’s about a third of the way down Akoros.
Rhi: Yeah. All right, so it’s a bit warmer than Duskwall. There’s beaches. I don’t know how much people still want to go swimming in the Void Sea, but there can still be beaches.
Kim: Maybe instead of the Void Sea it’s kind of like lake beaches, fresh water beaches?
Josie: Ooh.
Rhi: Ooh, so there’s inland… It’s still on the coast—
Kim: Right.
Josie: So it’s almost more like a delta, then, maybe.
Kim: Ooh.
Rhi: Oh, I like that.
Josie: Like Cairo or something.
Rhi: Yeah~
Minna: We could say maybe a river goes through those mountains that are a little bit inland from there.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, there could absolutely be a river coming out of there. Yeah, I like that. Once you get inland a bit there are beaches on the lakes and the river. That’s cool. I like that. anything else we wanna talk about with the local environment?
Josie: I feel like there’s a general sense of humidity. Duskwall is foggy. This place is just wet.
[laughter]
Minna: The Florida of Akoros.
Rhi: Oh no.
Kim: Ohh, that’s it.
Josie: Oh God, let’s not go that far.
Minna: No, it’s not that hot. It cannot possibly be that hot.
Rhi: No, it’s not gonna get that hot, but it can be a little bit warmer. Yeah, I like that, you’re just kind of damp constantly.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Anything else we wanna add on there?
Kim: I think that’s good.
Rhi: Okay, cool. Next question: What is a unique natural feature, neighborhood, or district in the city?
Josie: I have a natural feature for you.
Rhi: Yeah?
Josie: I’m thinking before the Cataclysm it was just a pretty small river and it all got splintered into all this delta nonsense which, you know, kind of messes with the sea level a bit…
Rhi: Uh-huh?
Josie: …so a reef off the coast now lies partially exposed. It’s like a big, mountainous fantasy reef to begin with. Right?
Rhi: Oh, that’s so cool.
Josie: But because it’s the Void Sea and shit is weird there’s still stuff alive out on the crags and it’s not like forest and mountain life, it’s like weird sea hybrid shit.
Rhi: Yeah, it would be like amphibious—Oh! That’s really cool!
Kim: Dope, Josie.
Josie: Woo! I may have cheated by looking ahead and thinking of this. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. Hey, that is fine. I’m gonna have to put this back at the beginning, but the questions that I’m asking, a couple of them are just from me thinking of basic questions that I would want but a lot of them are drawn from the town building section of Kids on Bikes and the city building section of Descent into Midnight. I just sort of looked at the lists of questions for both of those games and pulled out a lot of the questions that I liked, that felt like they were relevant for our planning here.
The next question on my list: How big is Whitehollow compared to Duskwall, both in terms of population and geography?
Minna: I believe that Whitehollow has a smaller population but it’s spread out over more space so there’s less density.
Rhi: That makes sense. I was gonna say, I feel like it’s gonna take up more geographical space just because of that delta that we’ve established.
Minna: Yeah. I think it’s a lot lower plane, like the typical height is one or maybe two story buildings, whereas I think you could get maybe a little bit higher in Duskwall.
Rhi: Yeah. Duskwall has buildings that are like… they don’t have skyscrapers yet, so they’re not gonna be able to get much above four stories.
Minna: Yeah, but two stories is tall in Whitehollow.
Josie: And then the hotel was six stories.
Rhi: Oh yeah, you’re right. Okay. Yeah, we’ve got up to six stories. They’ve got up to six floors, which is doable even before you’ve got steel framing.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: Which actually at this time…
Minna: They’ve gotta have steel because they have railroads.
Rhi: Well, the railroads preceded steel framing and architecture, because the first skyscrapers in Chicago were in like the 1880s? I’m getting on a tangent. Skyscrapers are still pretty new I think in Duskwall because it’s essentially Victorian era, so they wouldn’t be able to, like, really… yeah.
Minna: Sorry. [laughs] My brain is going faster than my ability to tell when people are talking. I’m just imagining that an imperial city is growing upwards and Duskwall hasn’t gotten there yet.
Rhi: Yeah. That would be super, super cool that the imperial city has legit skyscrapers. Okay, anything else we wanna say about the size of Whitehollow? I like the smaller population. I think that makes sense. Duskwall is kinda supposed to be a metropolis.
Minna: Because it was a staging area for the military, a lot, a lot of the draftees ended up coming from here, so their young male population is… not even young male, because—
Rhi: Yeah, it would be egalitarian.
Minna: Yeah. Their young population is well under…
Rhi: Decimated, yeah. So… oof.
Minna: Oof.
Rhi: Hey, it’s Blades in the Dark, this was never gonna be a cheerful place to visit.
[laughter]
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: It’s different! It’s a different place. Next question: What is the government like? I want to remind that up until recently it was probably just straight up run by the imperial military. It might still be, it might not, but yeah. Do we have thoughts about how…?
Josie: I feel like a lot of the military people who were in charge just kind of, a lot of them just retired and essentially retired from the military but kept their jobs a little bit, so it’s like a military aristocracy.
Rhi: Ooh, that’s cool.
Josie: Maybe a lot of them weren’t nobles and shit beforehand, so it’s like a burgeoning noble class rather than an established one.
Rhi: That’s cool. I like that. Do you think it would be structured similarly to Duskwall where they—So, Duskwall is run by a council of nobility, or well, there’s a lord governor and then there’s a council of nobles that advise and pass laws and things. Do we think it’s a similar council setup or more of a military hierarchy?
Kim: You know, it’s probably military.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: They still kinda follow those structures? Which I imagine causes some tension, because there’s probably people who are similarly ranked who are jockeying for who actually holds authority.
Josie: I feel like there’s still this general sense of meritocracy. Obviously not “really,” since it’s still a lot of privilege to get there, but it’s probably a lot more cutthroat within those ranks, like people trying to oust each other or prove they’re better than the other one.
Rhi: Yeah. I like that.
Josie: It’s less that there’s upward mobility but there is downward mobility. [laughs]
Rhi: [laughs] Yeah. Okay. That’s cool. Any other thoughts on how the government works? I don’t think that you all will be dealing directly with the government very much, but…
Kim: It depends on how much trouble we get in.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: Do you think that there’s any remnants of the pre-war government? Or at least do they adopt titles that came from the old government while mostly remaining…?
Rhi: Ooh, interesting. It was originally a small town of artisans.
Minna: Oh! So it was probably run by guilds.
Josie: Oh shit.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: What if they rebranded as a guild though after the war.
Rhi: Oh, yeah…
Minna: So now they’re the guild in charge even though they’re not an artisan guild.
Rhi: I like that. The handful of artisans who remain hate it.
Minna: Ugh, hate it.
Rhi: That’s cool. I like that. All right, next question: What industry is Whitehollow best known for?
Kim: I imagine that if it’s become a military state now that it’s probably really good at making arms. There’s probably a big blacksmithing community.
Rhi: That actually would make sense. There probably was smiths and metalworkers in the city from being artisans who got strong-armed into this production.
Kim: Yes.
Minna: Oh, and they’re probably… yeah. They’re at least benefitting a lot from the continued military presence.
Rhi: Yeah… Well, I think that’s gonna be another question. How much of a military presence is there still? I feel like it could go one of two ways. Either there’s still a heavy imperial military presence in the city or after the war ended the Empire might have been like “okay, this has been very expensive, we’re pulling most people out now.” I could see it going either way.
Minna: I like that a lot, actually.
Kim: I kinda like it being in transition.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: It absolutely would still be in transition, but it’s a question of is it transitioning…
Minna: I think it’s transitioning away, but the people who stayed and cobbed themselves up as guild masters don’t have a lot of connection to the central HQ of the military.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: But they come from a military background, so there’s still this sense of militarism around, but the actual military isn’t there.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. I imagine that a number of people, like, when the war ended they just got piled onto the ships and brought back from Skovlan and unloaded here, and I can see where a lot of soldiers would have just been like, well, I guess I live here now.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: You know, depending on what conditions they left from, staying in Whitehollow might have been more appealing. If you were living in desperate poverty, you know, maybe this is a chance to start over.
Minna: Do we think there’s a tourism industry here?
Rhi: My inclination is no, because I think Whitehollow still has that negative connotation from the draft.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: There’s still that slang of your Whitehollow letter. I was actually thinking about that as the intro to next episode where you all are on the train and the conductor’s gonna be like “Oh Whitehollow, you all enlisting?” [laughs] Or something like that. “Y’all get called up for something?” You know, I don’t think people go to Whitehollow for fun.
Minna: Yeah. Here’s the thing. I think 50 years ago it was a fashionable vacation spot.
Kim: Probably.
Minna: So there’s still remnants of that around, but it’s former glory that’s long gone now.
Rhi: Yeah. So, right now it’s still primarily a place that’s producing a lot of arms and weapons. Okay, so we have kind of the past… It used to have the tourist industry and art. Currently, or at least very recent past, producing a lot of arms and weapons. Do we think that they are sticking with that arms manufacturing or is there a push to move into something else? I can see where it would stay as being arms production given who’s in charge.
Minna: If there’s more advances being made in steel this seems like a good place for that to happen.
Kim: Ooh, yeah.
Rhi: Like in terms of…?
Minna: I mean, smith work seems to have become their main thing, I can see where innovations might happen here.
Rhi: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I’m gonna change it. Their industry now, that they’re known for, is just sort of smithing and metalworking generally. We’ve got arms, manufacturing, and steel production. [laughing] I’m so depressed about this city already.
Josie: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: It used to be this cool little artist commune.
Kim: We started with vacation spot and now it’s… war spot.
Rhi: Yeah, now it’s a tool of the military industrial complex.
Kim: [shouting angrily] Duskwall!
Rhi: [laughs] Well, in this case it’s not Duskwall, it’s Imperial City.
Kim: [shouting angrily] Imperialism! Ugh…
Rhi: I don’t think you all will ever make it to Imperial City, which is okay.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah. This isn’t that sort of game, I don’t think.
Kim: Yeah, no. I don’t wanna meet the Emperor.
Rhi: Yeah. We’re taking a hard left and going into some high level political intrigue!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Next question on the list: We’ve kind of already started to talk about this a little bit, but we might come up with something else. What is Whitehollow famous for?
Minna: What is it famous for? I mean, we already know what it’s famous for in recent history, and even I guess 50 years ago. I don’t know… Maybe there’s some other, like, it has to have other history and story to it, because it’s an old place.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Minna: Having some kind of fun, big, historical legend with it would be quite interesting.
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah, I like that. Let’s… Okay. What have we got so far? We’ve got this delta, the giant reef, guilds of artists… We could go ancient history, we could go pre-Cataclysm.
Kim: Ooh. Ooh!
Minna: We’re currently almost 850 years after the Cataclysm.
Rhi: Yeah, but stories are still around about it. Not a lot of stories, and they’re pretty warped by time, but… Yeah, there could have been something pre-Cataclysm or around the Cataclysm.
Kim: I like going that far back though.
Rhi: I kind of do too.
Minna: What if the reef is said to be the skeleton of some great beast that used to live there?
Rhi & Kim: Ooh…
Josie: Oh… Oh dear.
Kim: That’s my shit.
Josie: Like it’s the spine of Leviathan or whatever.
Kim: Ahh!
Minna: Something much larger than a leviathan.
Rhi: Yeah, something greater than a leviathan.
Josie: Oh yeah. No, I was talking capital L, biblical Leviathan. [laughs]
Rhi: Ah, yeah.
Minna: I think it is said to be, like, have some sort of protective nature for the city, the fact that they… Maybe they slew it and having it there is some form of protection for the city. It’s the White Wyrm.
Rhi: Ooh! Yes! I like the idea that, yeah, there’s this weird black coral and plant growth and stuff but it’s all growing on these white, bone-like structures.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Josie: Ooh, like bleached coral.
Rhi: That’s really cool. I assume you meant wyrm spelled with a Y.
Minna: You know, I’m good with either O or Y, but I was picturing with a Y. [giggles]
Kim: Y. Y. Y!
Rhi: Yeah. So was I, yeah.
Kim: Yes!
Rhi: I do like the idea. I like it when there’s always at least some little nugget of truth to these legends. I’m wondering if there’s something about the way the reef is positioned that it does protect the city, whether or not this legend is true.
Josie: Just the fact that it’s a big, natural mound out there, I imagine flooding and tsunamis and stuff just don’t break ground on the city because it’s out there to break it.
Rhi: Yeah! That’s kind of what I was thinking.
Minna: Yes!
Rhi: I don’t live on a coast. I was like, how do coasts work? I live in the middle of the country on a vast, flat plain. I don’t know how this works, but maybe it does something. Yeah. I like that idea that it actually does protect the city from, yeah, flooding and tsunamis. Yeah, that’s cool. I like that. There’s probably a bunch of taverns and establishments in town that reference the White Wyrm in their names. [gasps] There’s a local drink! It’s like if you go to New Orleans and get a Hurricane.
Minna: Ooh.
Kim: Yeah! I like that.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: The White Wyrm, it’ll fuck you up.
Kim: White Wyrm, welcome to Whitehollow.
Rhi: Yeah, you’re gonna die. [laughs] This thing will ruin you.
Kim: What’s that evil Chicago drink?
Rhi: Ugh, Malört.
Kim: Malört, yep, yep.
Rhi: No, it’s not Malört. I refuse. I draw—
Kim: No—
Rhi: It’s not.
Kim: White Wyrm isn’t as bad as a Merlot?
Rhi: Malört.
Kim: Malört?
Rhi: I refuse to put Malört in this game.
Josie: Okay. [laughs]
Kim: Okay. Okay!
Rhi: I cannot. Even as terrible as this setting is, it is free of the scourge… Fuck. It’s like drinking paint thinner and death.
Minna: So this local drink… I just like the idea that it’s white because it has goat’s milk in it or something.
Rhi: Ooh, so like a White Russian, kinda.
Minna: Yeah, probably.
Rhi: I think it just probably has a shitload of different alcohols in it, and I feel like a bunch of bars in the city all have something called a White Wyrm on the menu and it’s all made with, like, the common thread is goat’s milk and then some vodka-like alcohol but then everybody has their own twist on it.
Josie: Uh-huh.
Rhi: This is great. I love this very much. This is cool. Okay, infamous for… I think we’ve established the draft is pretty much I think what it’s gonna be infamous for. I think there’s probably still a lot of undue resentment aimed at the town, because Whitehollow as a town, city, is not responsible for the draft but when you have a war that lasts for 36 years…
Minna: Symbols can be scapegoats.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Economically, Whitehollow is prosperous, stagnant, floundering, something else? What do we think?
Josie: I think it’s stagnant. Would floundering be better? I feel like it’s frustrating because the draft is over, people wanna get things back to the way they were, but now all the military people there are being obstinate and trying to be their own nobility and stuff like that.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: I like the idea building on it being a transition period that maybe there’s less demand for the arms stuff and less demand for the military stuff so they’re sort of in a transition period figuring out, okay, so what is there going to be a demand for that we can do.
Rhi: Yeah. I think I’m gonna add onto this, I think that like in Duskwall there is a growing unionization effort.
Kim: Mm!
Minna: Ooh yes.
Rhi: I think it depends on who is in the union.
Josie: I feel like it makes sense that the former guilds, right, are approaching unionization?
Minna: yeah.
Rhi: [gasps] yeah~
Josie: Because it lets them prosper, and then the military’s like “nope, we’re in power, stop that.”
Rhi: Okay. Former guilds are backing the unions as like, “Well… we can work with this.”
Minna: I feel like if guilds and artisans used to be the rule before the military came in, I think that as a structure probably was at least afforded more protection for people who worked.
Rhi: Yeah, that was the whole idea of an artisan guild back in the day, if you were a member of a guild you had to pay dues and meet certain standards but also, you know, you had certain protections.
Minna: They’re drawing on that old organization that people were still left.
Rhi: Yeah, I like that. That’s cool. Yeah, okay, so it probably is then pretty similar to how Duskwall’s unionization is going where there’s a pretty strong union movement but it’s being very violently opposed by the powers that be.
Minna: I like that we’ve already got factions going.
Josie: Yep. [laughs]
Rhi: Yep. [laughs] I structured these in this way for a reason. Okay, next question: What is a unique element of the local infrastructure? Something about transportation, how trade works, emergency services. This could be kind of the police force. The police force we could also address in the notable local organizations, but… what do we think?
Minna: Hmm…
Kim: Hmm…
Rhi: Oh, I had an idea.
Kim: You do?
Minna: Ooh?
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Ooh.
Rhi: Does anybody else have an idea? Because I don’t want to jump on people.
Kim: No. No.
Josie: I’m good.
Rhi: Okay. We established that we’ve got the city, I’m imagining that the city is kind of built around this delta. Right? There’s a lot of waterways and things. What if the central market is a floating market?
Josie: Yeah!
Kim: Yes! Like it’s Venice.
Rhi: Yeah. You’ve got all of the, you know, a lot of the merchants just have boats. The boats all just float out in this massive market and you just… I imagine there’s gangways and stuff that you can walk, but then there’s also their version of the Gondoliers that will take you around. Do we like that?
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: I love that.
Rhi: Yeah… All right.
Minna: We need to somehow, someday bring Tangletown into Magpies, because I love that shit.
Rhi: Yeah! Yeah.
Josie: What is Tangletown?
Minna: It’s a thing in Crow’s Foot. A big leviathan hunter ship sank partly in the river and now it’s just got a floating neighborhood on it.
Josie: Ha, that’s fun.
Minna: It’s also neutral ground.
Rhi: Yeah, criminals are not allowed to fight there.
Josie: Interesting.
Minna: It’s important because Crow’s Foot was, until recently, torn apart by gang war.
Rhi: Yeah.
Josie: Following off on this thing, there’s also just, you know, like in Duskwall a lot of bridges? I also feel like market bridges are a thing. Like in Venice there’s this bridge called the Ponte Vecchio which is a thin bridge but just straight up has shops on either side of it hanging over the water.
Rhi: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Oh God, I love that.
Minna: I love bridges with buildings on them.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: That’s, yes, I love that very much.
Josie: Whereas Duskwall is very distinct in its neighborhoods and there’s not much on the bridges dividing them.
Rhi: Right. I think there are the bridge that connects the main part of Duskwall to Whitecrown, which is kind of an island out in the bay, that’s the really, really expensive neighborhood, I think that bridge does have some homes on it, I’m not 100% sure though.
Josie: Gotcha.
Rhi: All right. Anything else we wanna add to that?
Josie: I just had an idea for law enforcement. I feel like it’s pretty much the same except they’re the Graycoats, or whatever color military uniforms are.
Rhi: Ohh. Yeah-yeah, I don’t…
Josie: Oh, that’s kind of jumping onto the next question, huh?
Rhi: That’s okay. We needed to- I’m gonna treat law enforcement as a separate thing because we absolutely need to know what the law enforcement is like in the city.
Josie: Right.
Rhi: Everybody, you each will get to add something in terms of the local organizations but then we’ll also have law enforcement. I don’t know what the uniforms look like. I don’t know what the colors of the Empire are.
Kim: It would make sense to have it be like, this is a little on the nose, but have it be a royal purple dye or something like that.
Minna: I don’t know why I picture red.
Rhi: I was thinking red too. Let me look. I’m gonna do a quick search in the PDF to see if I can figure out if there’s anything about the imperial colors in here.
Minna: Right.
Rhi: But, while I’m looking that up, the next question on the list is: What is a notable local landmark? I’m thinking of this in terms of, like, because we kinda had the unique natural feature that’s something that is natural, this landmark I’m thinking is something manmade.
Minna: I was thinking about maybe a clock tower that has maybe fun clockwork in it.
Rhi: Ooh.
Kim: It has fun clockwork, and since it was made by artisans it’s very ornate. It has silver filigree around the edges and whatnot.
Minna: It’s one of those ones that has a little scene that plays out at certain times of day.
Rhi: [gasps] Ooh, yes.
Josie: Oh yay.
Kim: Ooh, yeah.
Josie: And I think maybe it has two sets of numbers on it, or some way to indicate military time now.
Rhi: Ohh… Okay.
Minna: So, the 12 hours after dawn are numbered and the 12 hours after twilight are usually named according to local custom which varies from city to city. Maybe they have the original Whitehollow names but then they also have the imperial city names which is what the military uses.
Rhi: Ooh! Yes, that’s very good. Okay. Yeah, I think that’s gonna be the version of military time. When you’re in the military you need everybody to be operating on a standard set of names for the hours. I like that.
Minna: And they need to be distinguishable.
Rhi: Yeah. God, it looks so shitty, too.
Josie: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: It was this beautifully, like, everything was measured and crafted and then you’ve just got these extra 12 names welded on. Ugh. I love it, that’s awful. Cool. Okay, do we wanna add anything else about this clock tower? … Where do we think it is in the city?
Minna: I was thinking it was central.
Kim: I was gonna say, it’s gotta be smackdab in the middle of it, right?
Josie: Mm-hmm.
Minna: What if it’s like the guild master’s hall where the council used to meet?
Rhi: Yeah! Okay, yeah, I was trying to think of some sort of big meeting area. Yeah. Do you think it’s part of that building? I’m also picturing there’s the guild hall and then there’s a plaza outside where the clock tower is.
Minna: Yeah, I was thinking the center of a circular plaza.
Rhi: Nice. What do we think this guild master’s hall is used for now?
Josie: Maybe that the military turned that into their HQ.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking.
Minna: Yeah, it’s the garrison.
Rhi: Yep. Ugh. UGH, that sucks so bad. It’s the local garrison and I think that’s where the military leadership meets.
Minna: That was where they processed all of the draftees and shit.
Rhi: Ohh, that sucks so bad!
Minna: So you’d have people lined up and thronging this plaza.
Kim: Oof.
Rhi: Yeah. Oh, I love it. That’s so good. Okay. For this next one we’re gonna talk about: What is a notable local organization? Let’s start by talking about law enforcement and then each of you can come up with some other organization that can fall into any of the major categories that we have in Duskwall. It can be a criminal gang, they can have to do with labor or trade, they can be one of the weirder fringe groups, but let’s start with law enforcement because that is gonna be relevant. [laughs]
Kim: Unfortunately.
Rhi: Josie, you had suggested Graycoats?
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: I like it, but I want it to be gray… like, gray and red or gray and purple.
Josie: I like gray and red.
Kim: I was gonna say gray and red.
Rhi: I think the uniforms are almost indistinguishable from the standard military uniforms.
Josie: Yeah. [laughs]
Rhi: Because they would have had so many of the damn uniforms lying around after 36 years.
Josie: Right. Maybe since it’s hot and humid they’ve taken some of them in or shortened the sleeves or whatever.
Rhi: Yeah. I’m picturing a light heather gray.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Kim: Mm, yep.
Rhi: With dark red detailing.
Kim: A heather gray with a maroon, I can see that.
Rhi: Are we thinking that they’re, you know… The Bluecoats in Duskwall are basically a gang backed by the government. How do we think the Graycoats operate?
Josie: They’re fractions of the military led by the former military people. They’re a fucking gang.
Rhi: I’m gonna latch onto something that you said, that they’re factions of the military. What if the Graycoats are not really a unified force?
Minna: Oh God.
Rhi: What if you’ve got people where it’s like I served under General so-and-so and so I’m loyal to them, and then you’ve got other members of the Graycoats who are like well I served with Captain so-and-so and I’m loyal to them.
Kim: That’s definitely what it is.
Minna: Because these are basically all rogue military people now, because they’re not part of the official structure anymore.
Josie: Oof.
Rhi: Yeah. I think everybody formally retired for the most part, I don’t think they’ve just gone completely rogue, but I think that they’re still operating in those very military structures. So yeah… I think they operate like a bunch of gangs. They actually might be less effective, because there’s a ton of infighting.
Kim: Yep. Yeah.
Minna: But they might be competing for territory like ‘gang’ gangs.
Rhi: Mm-hmm, yeah, I think so, but that means that then they probably spend as much… I think that the complaint about them is they spend as much time fighting each other as they do dealing with crime in the city.
Minna: Yeah.
Josie: God, there’s like faction politics within faction politics in this city. [laughs]
Rhi: Mm-hmm. Yup. That’s awesome. Okay, so they are probably not a super effective police force.
Josie: Right, whereas the Bluecoats are like… you don’t wanna mess with them too much, they are effective when they come after you.
Rhi: Yeah, because they are bringing down the full united force, generally speaking. There’s always little rogue elements, but for the most part they’re a solid front. Okay, so we’ve got law enforcement, now each one of you can add an additional organization.
Josie: I have a weird idea. One of the old guilds called the Delvers Guild, or if we wanna get silly, the Scuba Guild.
Rhi: [giggles]
Minna: [gasps]
Josie: I think their whole idea was to go down in the water, originally around the reef, but now in all the canals and lakes and deltas, and dig shit up essentially. Part of that is just archeological and they bring up old pottery and stuff, or they sometimes find sunken treasure, or you know little bits of R’lyeh or something like that. They just go down and bring up weird shit.
Rhi: That is awesome.
Josie: And the reason they’re still going is the military for the most part doesn’t give a shit about them because they’re just kinda doing their own thing.
Rhi: That’s really cool. I like that very much.
Josie: They’re not overtly a cult, but if there is a guild that is a cult it’s probably this one.
Rhi: [laughs] Possibly a cult. Yeah, I can absolutely see where 100 years ago somebody in this group found some powerful statue of an ancient god that they low-key all worship at. That’s really cool! I love that a lot.
Kim: They’re probably also really interested in that legend of the wyrm. They probably are trying to find that as well.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah. They probably have the best maps of the reef mountain.
Kim: Oh, Blaire is gonna be so-the-fuck into this.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: God, that’s cool. Okay.
Kim (as Blaire): Please, can we play with the cultists, please? Please-please-please? Can we play with the Divers Guild?
[laughter]
Rhi: That’s very cool. I like Delvers Guild. That’s cool. Okay, Kim or Minna? Let’s get some more groups in here.
Kim: Josie took my occult weird thing so now I gotta…
Josie: Heh-heh-heh.
Rhi: We can always have more than one weird occult thing happening here.
Kim: Ohh. Hmm…
Rhi: We should probably have at least one local criminal organization. Now, the criminals could also be into the occult.
Kim: That’s true.
Rhi: But, you know, you gotta figure out whose toes you’re gonna be stepping on by being here.
Minna: I have an idea. I think we’ve got the Queen of Fortune.
Rhi: Ooh.
Minna: She pretty much runs the gambling scene in the city. If you try and nose in on her turf you are in trouble.
Rhi: So all the casinos, any taverns where they have card tables…
Kim: I like that.
Josie: And I bet she’s still doing well, because if there’s one thing off-duty soldiers like to do it’s drink and gamble.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Rhi: I think she probably made her fortune during the war. Yeah.
Kim: Yup, absolutely.
Rhi: Cool. Do we think that she is kind of a well-known public figure? There’s some criminals that, like an Al Capone type, where they just show up and be like the fuck are you gonna do to me, or do we think she’s more shrouded in mystery, like ooh, the Queen of Fortune, nobody actually knows who she is and what she looks like.
Kim: I like shrouded in mystery.
Minna: I think she’s shrouded in mystery, but if you ask around enough and she’s interested she’ll send someone out to get you, and she maybe sometimes makes deals if you need something.
Rhi: Yeah. I don’t know if you’ll meet her, but I like the idea. This war went on for about 40 years. I like the idea that she’s like in her 70s.
Minna: Mm-hmm!
Josie: [laughs] Yes.
Kim: Yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
Rhi: How does she feel about cheating?
Minna: Don’t get fucking caught.
Rhi: And what happens if you do get caught?
Josie: I feel like first offense you lose some teeth, second offense you lose a hand, and there is no third offense.
Rhi: Ooh… I want the third offense to be that she has some massive, I’m just picturing those fucking Everglades gators, that she just has one of those that she fucking feeds you to.
[laughing and cheering]
Kim: Yes! Yup.
Josie: Forget the three strikes thing, she just has fucking pet gators. You don’t wanna get fed to those gators.
Rhi: Yeah, but I like that it’s not that you can’t cheat, but if you cheat badly enough that you get caught you’ll get fed to the gators.
Kim: Yep. That’s very good.
Josie: Yeah.
Minna: Yes.
Rhi: Her top lieutenants have gator skin boots that are made out of the ones that get old and die.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: All right, Kim.
Kim: Yes, I have an idea now. I think we should start diving into the specifics of one of the artist guilds that’s still sticking around.
Rhi: Yeah~
Josie: Ooh.
Kim: I’m thinking either silversmiths or goldsmiths, but I don’t know how common, in a place that’s so war-ravaged, that the goldsmiths would still be around, maybe just the silversmiths.
Rhi: Yeah, I like silversmiths.
Minna: Ooh.
Kim: All right, yeah, we can just call them Silversmiths Guild.
Rhi: Well, I’m putting that down as a placeholder. If you’ve got a better name for it, by all means.
Kim: Just to keep things setting-wise, make it fun, if I had a different name I would, but I don’t right now. I’ll be open to that. Otherwise, they’re an artisans guild that deals in not only jewelry and finery and probably fine silverware and whatnot, they also contributed to the decorations on the clock, so they also do architectural silversmithing that’s decorative.
Minna: See, I just thought of something that’s a little bit further back in our history than this period, but a lot of the engravers in the Revolutionary War era in America were silversmiths.
Kim: yes! Yes, that’s true.
Minna: And they did a lot of protest art during the war, so I don’t know if that’s anything.
Kim: Minna, that’s brilliant. Yeah.
Rhi: Yeah, I like that.
Kim: No, absolutely, as artists they would be totally opposed to the war, and yeah, there’s probably some kind of Paul Revere type in there.
Minna: Ah, there’s like underground engravers and publishers and shit, mostly related to the silversmiths guild.
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: Yeah, I like the idea that they were kind of the leaders of the anti-military protests during the war.
Kim: Yes, that’s very good.
Rhi: And I think that’s why, I think a lot of the other guilds just completely fell apart during the war, but I think the fact that they had this ideological basis held them together.
Kim: I can see that a lot.
Rhi: So what are they up to now? I imagine they are not popular with the ruling government.
Josie: No.
Kim: No, they’re probably not popular, but besides just surviving I like to imagine that they’re probably helping rebuild, because there’s probably a lot of things that have fallen into disarray so they’re trying to help not only because they have the foundational skills to put things back together but also, you know, bring things back to their former glory.
Minna: I mean, if this was a big thing even before the war I imagine that Whitehollow silver with a mark from the guild is worth quite a bit.
Kim: Mm-hmm.
Rhi: Oh man, I can see during the war where they would craft stuff for these military officers that, you know… I just have this idea of silverware that they baked poison into that over the course of months, using the silverware, they just got sicker and sicker and sicker.
Kim: [gasps] yeah~!
Josie: Oh shit.
Rhi: The slowest assassination.
Kim: That’s brilliant.
Josie: Oof. Yeah, they hold power just because they’re so ubiquitous in minor ways.
Rhi: Mm-hmm. I think it’s that Whitehollow silver is well-known outside the city and within the city they’re too entwined in the city’s identity and history for the leadership to just crush them, because they know that if they do hell will break loose so they have to tolerate them.
Josie: Right.
Kim: Yep, that’s exactly it. I’m still trying to think of a name for them, and my brain just keeps going back to moon or stars. I’m trying to think of what’s silver in the natural world.
Rhi: Yeah, I mean both of those would work. We’ve got some time. You can come back to a name.
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: If you bolt upright in the middle of the night just message me. [laughs]
Kim: Okay.
Rhi: “I’ve come up with it! The perfect name!”
Kim: My brain keeps going to the Silver Spinners instead of the Silver Smiths.
Rhi: That’s cool! I like that.
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: So just the Silver Spinners is what they’re called?
Kim: Yeah, well the Silver Spinners Guild.
Rhi: Yeah, I like that. Cool, I like this a lot. This is such a- I’m so bummed we’re only spending an episode here!
Kim: Ugh!
Josie: I mean, no one’s saying we can’t do another Blades game in Whitehollow. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah. This is so cool. Okay. The next question is another one that’s gonna be from each of you, and these will probably be a little shorter. What is a notable element of the local culture? This can be fashion, food, art — we already touched on art a little bit with the Whitehollow silver, some sort of religious thing, just one element of the local culture. It doesn’t have to be something that is well-known outside of it but just something that’s kind of uniquely Whitehollow.
Kim: So, because this is a river delta town and it has fresh water that probably has wildlife that is slightly less toxic than what lives in the Void Sea, Whitehollow is known for very good freshwater fish dishes.
Rhi: Yeah~
Kim: It’s got pretty decent… I shouldn’t say seafood because it’s not from the sea.
Rhi: Yeah, freshwater…
Kim: It’s got a good pescatarian selection.
Josie: Good old Whitehollow salmon.
Rhi: Yeah!
Kim: Yeah, salmon’s freshwater.
Rhi: Salmon, probably crawdads.
Josie: Oh yeah.
Kim: Probably really good eel, good freshwater eel.
Josie: Oh God, I bet the eels are really weird in this setting.
Rhi: Oh, they’re so fucking weird.
Kim: How weird? All right, no, that’s a tangent. I’ll put it away.
[laughter]
Rhi: Okay! Yeah. I like that. Josie or Minna, what else is something we got?
Josie: I think a lot of just quirks of custom, like their alternative to exclaiming Jesus Christ or bless you or, you know, little elements of the dress, or just weird dialect quirks are actually remnants of – and no one knows this at all, to everyone it’s just normal – are actually remnants of some forgotten god’s worship.
Rhi: Ooh~!
Josie: Only the cult of the forgotten god would know that, and obviously there’s been tons of linguistic drift and the like, but it’s just baked in there.
Rhi: I like the idea that there’s some gesture that people do that, you know how like when we’re leaving some place you just wave your hand, some gesture that’s like that of everybody’s just this is how we say farewell, but it’s actually like a corrupted version of the sign of blessing for this god.
Josie: Gotcha. I think people kind of wave in a semi-salute, like it’s your index and middle finger and then your thumb, and you just kinda wave like that.
Rhi: Okay, so rather than your whole hand it’s just the…
Kim: I can picture it.
Rhi: Yeah.
Kim: See, they call it a bubbler, because… back in the old days, back in the days of old.
[laughter]
Rhi: The ancient bubbling god did spew forth from the sea!
Kim: Yes.
Rhi: That’s cool. I like that, yeah, that there’s just this ancient forgotten god that everybody… it could even have been before the Cataclysm, that everybody worshipped this god.
Josie: Yep.
Rhi: Aw, that’s cool, I like that. All right, Minna.
Minna: I know I keep drawing on real-world war-related shit…
Rhi: Yeah, no, do it.
Minna: I just love the idea of an underground movement of war poets here.
Josie: Yeah!
Rhi: [gasps] That’s so good!
Minna: Sort of post-World War I style, because I’m super into anti-imperial bullshit happening.
Rhi: Yes! Yes! Yes!
Josie: Yes please.
Minna: I think anti-imperial intellectuals might be my little happy niche.
Kim: Well, considering.
Rhi: Was that… That group of writers was The Lost Generation, right? That’s what they were called?
Minna: I don’t know what you call them. I’m just talking about people like Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, like post-World War I. I don’t know what you call that movement of poets.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s what it is, the writers who were like… Ernest Hemingway is kind of the iconic one of that, but yeah, all of those writers who were working, writing in reaction to the war.
Josie: Now I’m just thinking that there’s a burgeoning Dadaist movement within that circle. [laughs]
Kim: Yes!
Rhi: [laughs] I’m gonna say war poets and other writers. That generation is Hemingway, that’s Fitzgerald, that’s like… all of those.
Kim: Give me the Dadaism.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s cool.
Kim: Dada. Dada.
Rhi: Growing Dadaist… That’s a phrase.
Kim: Yes! Yeah.
Rhi: Dadaist-esque. Bleh.
Josie: [laughs]
Kim: Phew.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s a mouthful.
Josie: Art, am I right?
Rhi: [laughs] Is there anything, any particularly well-known poets that are starting to get some attention within the city? Anybody who’s standing out, or any other details you wanna add to this? Because I’m super into this.
Josie: I think someone published a book or pamphlet or something that got banned.
Rhi: Ooh.
Josie: Like it was just too incendiary so the military powers crushed it.
Rhi: Yeah.
Minna: God, it was like fucking allegorical but the least subtle allegory you’ve ever heard of, and the villain of the piece was the Immortal Emperor.
Rhi: [gasps] Oh shit!
Josie: Oh no!
Rhi: Do we think a novel?
Minna: Either that or an epic poem, I don’t know which would be more likely.
Rhi: Nope, it’s an epic poem~
[laughter]
Josie: Yeah.
Rhi: As soon as you say something’s illegal everyone’s like “uh, I need it immediately.” That’s really good. I’m not gonna write it. I’m not gonna write a poem.
Minna: [giggles]
Rhi: If any of you wanna write a poem, Godspeed, but I’m not gonna write a poem. I’m just putting that out there right now, just so that you have your expectations set.
Minna: Listen, I’m already over here with my fucking collective of semi-anti-imperial North Sea historians that have not taken on a life of their own in my brain at all. Leave me alone.
Rhi: Teehee. Very good.
Josie: Minna, you’re good.
Rhi: Yes. Last couple questions. What is a prominent natural, religious, or cultural event that is important to this city?
Minna: What if there was an exhibition day that used to be when all the journeymen showed their master works off, so it’s just a big old street festival with people showing off the cool shit they’ve made. It’s probably in the future going to evolve into almost a world fair type of thing.
Rhi: Oh yes! Yeah! That’s so cool.
Josie: Nice.
Rhi: Okay, I have questions. What is it called?
Minna: Exhibition Day? [laughs] That’s what I had already, but I don’t know.
Rhi: Okay, that’s fine. I wasn’t sure if you had a different name for it. Okay, so Exhibition Day.
Minna: I don’t have a better name right now.
Rhi: That’s fine. How was this celebrated, if it was celebrated, during the war? What did this look like during the war? Did it happen at all? Did it happen in a greatly reduced capacity?
Josie: I think it happened, but there had to be military drills or a changing of the guard component to show off weapons.
Kim: There was definitely cut funding.
Minna: Yeah.
Rhi: And I think there was a lot of pressure for the works that you showed to be supporting the war effort.
Minna: Mm-hmm.
Josie: Right.
Kim: Ugh.
Josie: We’re really getting some insight into the imperialism of the Immortal Emperor here.
Rhi: Yeah!
Josie: Because the whole deal with Duskwall is that is still kind of had an insular local identity and this is what happens when a city couldn’t maintain that entirely.
Rhi: Yeah. This is why Skovlan fought so hard, because they saw the fucking writing on the wall.
Minna: Yeah. The stupid historians living in my brain are all about that.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: Do we wanna add anything else to this?
Josie: I think it’s had a resurgence now that the war is over, and now this is the one day where those underground anti-war people can show their true colors before they go back in hiding for the rest of the year.
Rhi: I feel like there’s also been the military, after seeing people be more open about their anti-military, anti-war protesting during this event, there hasn’t been any kind of revolt or riot or attack yet, but there’s an assumption that it will happen, so I feel like the amount of military presence or Graycoat presence at this thing keeps slowly ramping up every year because they’re just like “you all are gonna try something.”
Minna: God, there’s gonna be a riot one year.
Rhi: I’m actually thinking that one year, it’s not gonna be this year when you’re there, but there’s gonna be where, because all the Graycoats are at the festival location, everything else is unguarded and they’re gonna blow up some massive military structure that was left unprotected. It’s gonna be great. I’m proud of them already. They haven’t done it yet, but I’m proud of them.
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: This last question is also the last question that is asked when you’re doing city building in Descent into Midnight, and it is probably one of my favorite questions for worldbuilding. What is something small but special that most people take for granted?
Minna: [impressed exhale]
Josie: I feel like it was touched on already, and it was silverware.
Rhi: Whitehollow silverware?
Josie: Yeah. It’s not common in this time period for people to have normal ass silverware. It’s all thoroughly alloyed or just made to seem silver, right?
Kim: Right.
Josie: But here, everyone has little things made of silver. Maybe it’s just silver in general.
Rhi: I like that it’s specifically silverware because that’s very utilitarian.
Josie: Okay, and if anyone goes out of the city it’s like “what do you mean your silverware isn’t made of silver? Why is it called silverware then?”
Rhi: Yeah. “What is this crap?”
Josie: Because it’s cheap here, anyone can get it.
Kim: Yeah.
Rhi: There are mountains somewhat inland, so I think there’s gotta be some big silver mines in those mountains. There’s probably a smaller mining settlement there. I think that there’s probably a train line that runs between, then. Cool.
Josie: Because in Victorian era silverware was a sign of class and nobility.
Rhi: Yeah, that’s why you’re always like, you know, maids run off with the silverware because it’s literally made of silver and you melt that shit down and you’re set.
Josie: Right. [laughs]
Rhi: Yeah, that’s cool. I like that. Okay, well, I really like this city that we’ve made.
Kim: Yeah.
Josie: yeah!
Rhi: That we’ve put together here. Yeah. I think this is gonna be a really—I do not know how much of this you’re gonna be able to interact with, I’m gonna do some planning over the next week and a half, but yeah. There is a lot here that you all could explore, and I think this also is gonna help me figure out where the Hand of Kotar is. [laughs] Yeah! I’m excited about this. I’m very much looking forward to the next couple episodes where you’ll be out of Duskwall for a little bit.
Minna: I’m so excited.
Rhi: I know, I am too. It’s gonna be cool. So, thank you all for helping me, well, not really helping, you all did 90% of the work on this. Thank you all for building this place!
Josie: [laughs]
Rhi: It’s gonna be really cool. I’m excited about spending a little bit of time here.
Minna: I love worldbuilding. [giggles]
Rhi: Yeah, it’s so much fun."
